HVMILITY, CONSECRATETH THESE HIS LABOVRS: THOUGH FAR UNWORTHY THE VIEW OF SO
RESPLENDANT A GREATNESS.

THE AVTHOR TO THE READER.
Having seen (judicious Reader how carefully in other Kingdoms, the Monuments
of the dead are preserved, and their Inscriptions or Epitaphs registered in
their Church-Bookes; and having read the Epitaphs of Italy, France, Germany,
and other Nations, collected and put in print by the pains of Schraderus,
Chytraeus, Swertius, and other foreign Writers. And also knowing withal how
barbarously within these his Majesty's Dominions, they are (to the shame of our
time) broken down, and utterly almost all ruinated, their brazen Inscriptions
erazed, torn away, and pilfered, by which inhumane, deformidable act, the
honorable memory of many virtuous and noble persons deceased, is extinguished,
and the true understanding of diverse Families in these Realms (who have
descended of these worthy persons aforesaid) is so darkened, as the true course
of their inheritance is thereby partly interrupted: grieuing at this
insufferable injury offered as well to the living, as the dead, out of the
respect I bore to venerable Antiquity, and the due regard to continue the
remembrance of the defunct to future posterity; I determined with my self to
collect such memorials of the deceased, as were remaining as yet undefaced; as
also to revive the memories of eminent worthy persons entombed or interred,
either in Parish, or in Abbey Churches* howsoever some of their Sepulchers are
at this day no where to be discerned; neither their bones and ashie remains in
any place to be gathered. Whereupon with painful expenses (which might have
been well spared perhaps you will say) I travailed over the most parts of all
England, and some part of Scotland; I collected the Funeral Inscriptions of
all the Cathedral Churches of the one, and in some of the other, and ever by
the way gathered such as I found in Parochial Churches* I likewise took view
of many ancient Monuments not inscribed, demanding of the Church officers, or
others the inhabitants, for whom such and such Tombs or Sepulchers were made
and erected, which was told me according to that truth which was delivered unto
them by tradition: after all this scrutinie, finding so few, or none at all in
many Churches (time, the malignitie of wicked people, and our English profane
tenacitie, having quite taken them away for lucre sake) I was altogether
discouraged to proceed any further in this my laborious and expencefull
enterprise; until I came casually into the acquaintance of my dear deceased
friend, Augustine Vincent, Esquire, Windsor Herald, and keeper of the Records
in the Tower, who persuaded me to go forward as I had begun, and withal gave
me many Church-Collections, with diverse memorable Notes, and Copies of Records,
gathered by himself and others; and by his means I had free access to the
Heralds Office, to write out such antiquities as I could there find for my
purpose.

But above all, I am most bound to love the foresaid Vincents memory, for that
he made me known to that honorable Gentleman Sir Robert Cotton, Knight and
Baronet; who forthwith apprehending the scope and drift of this my Argument
(his generous disposition being always ready to afford his best furtherance to
other men's industrious labors) gave me his able directions, and withal, lent
me out of his inestimable Library, such Books and Manuscripts as were most
fitting for my use.

But alas, this worthy repairer of eating-times ruins, this Philadelphus, in
preserving old Monuments, and ancient Records: this Magazin, this Treasury,
this Storehouse of Antiquities, Sir Robert Cotton, is now lately deceased,
whose excellent good parts are well conceived in a Funeral Elegy which has
happily come into my hands, and which I think fitting here to be inserted.

Viro clarissimo Roberto Cottono, ab antiqua Regum prosapia oriundo, Epicedium.
Qualis Homerus erat, cuius de font furores
Sacros hauserunt veteresque nouique Poetae* A funeral Elegy upon the death
of Sir Robert Cotton Knight and Baronet.

Talis eras nostros inter, Cottone, Britannos,
Rerum explorator veterum. Ciuilia iura
Regni, Magnatum molimina, munia Regum
Et populi, nexus faustos, diuortia saeua,
Nauigia, et merces, castra, arts, religiones,
Nummos, structuras, chartas, solennia verba,
Et quic quid bello faceret vel pace triumphos
Callebat dextre, nemo magis, omnis ab illo
Et tua Camdene and Seldeni gloria creuit*
Ingentes Dominos titulorum dote superbos
Famo sosque Equites (simul omnes si perijssent)
Quiuis Rex Orbi potis est renouare; beatum
Cottoni pectus nulla est reparabile cera.
Ingenio quicunque vigent tua tecta frequenter
Visebant, tanquam a Phoebo responsa petentes.
Nunc Oracla silent, sed non Schediasmate tantae
Oceanum laudis liceat transnare, misellum
Nescio quid gaudens ad amici iusta litasse:
Omnia complectar celebrat Wigornia verbis
Queis Neckami obitum, crescitque in carmine verum.
"Eclipsim patitur sapientia, Sol sepelitur,
"Cui si par vnus minus esset flebile funus.
He died at his house in Westminster the sixth of May, about ten of the clock
in the forenoone, Anno 1631. being aged, threescore years, three months, and
some few odd days: He took to wife Elizabeth, one of the daughters and
heirs of William Brocas Esquire, by whom he had issue, only one Son, Sir
Thomas Cotton Baronet, now living; who married Margaret, Daughter of the Lord
William Howard, grandchild to Thomas Duke of Norfolk, by whom he has issue,
one Son, named John, and two Daughters, Lucie and Francis.

But to return: I have had many helps, I confess, from Sir Henry Spelman,
Knight, and John Seldom Esquire, the most learned Antiquaries now living of our
times: nor have the helps been few which I have long received from the well
furnished, and daily increasing Library of Sir Simonds D'Ewes Knight, whose
judicious directions, and ready assistance, were as often vouchsafed unto me,
as I had occasion to request, and whose long studied, and still intended
labors for the public good, though in another kind, may in due time make
his memory and themselves dear unto posterity: Diverse of the Heralds have
much furthered these my intended designs; namely, Sir Richard, and Sir Henry
Saint George, Knights* John Philipot, and William Le Neue, Esquires, which I
shall ever acknowledge, as occasion presents it self.

Venerable Bede, when he compiled the Chronicles of the English Saxons, had
all the help that might be of the Bishops and learned men of this Land.
Cymbertus wrote unto him all that was done in Lincolnshire: Nothelmus also sent
unto him all that he had gathered together in Sussex, Surrey, and Kent.
Alcuinus gave him his labors and collections for the Province of York. Daniel
of Winchester made him privy of all that was done amongst the west Saxons: And
from all other quarters of the Land, were Letters, Scrowles, and writings,
directed unto him by messengers, to aid and assist him in his enterprise, as
he does himself acknowledge in his Epistle Dedicatory to Ceolnulph, King of
the Northumbers.

Now generous Reader, as he had these helps for the perfecting of his
Ecclesiastical History, and as I have had the acceptable assistance of many
of my good friends, studious in this kind, for the finishing of this first
part, and the rest of the work now in hand, which is already in a good
forwardness, let me entreat thy furtherance in the same thus far, that, in
thy neighboring Churches, if thou shall find any ancient funeral
Inscriptions, or antique obliterated Monuments, thou would be pleased to
copy out the one, and take so much relation of the other as tradition can
deliver; as also to take the Inscriptions and Epitaphs upon Tombs and
Grauestones which are of these times; and withal to take order that such thy
collections, notes, and observations may come safely to my hands; and I shall
rest ever obliged to acknowledge thy pains and courtesy.

And I would earnestly desire the Tombe-makers of this City of London, and
elsewhere, that they would be so careful of posterity, as to preserve in
writing the Inscriptions or Epitaphs which they daily engraue upon Funeral
Monuments, from whom I shall expect the like kindness, and to whom I will ever
remain alike thankful. For, I intend, God willing, hereafter to publish to
the view of the world, as well the modern, as the ancient memorialls of the
dead throughout all his Majesty's foresaid Dominions, if God spare me life; if
not, it is enough for me to have begun, as Camden says in his Epistle to the
Reader of his book Britannia, and I have gained as much as I look for, if I
shall draw others, when I am dead, into this argument; whose inquisitiue
diligence and learning, may find out more, and amend mine.

It may seem, peradventure, unpleasing to some, for that I do speak so much
of, and extol the ardent piety of our forefathers in the erecting of Abbeyes,
Priories, and such like sacred Foundations.

To the which I answer with Camden, that I hold it not fit for us to forget,
that our Ancestors were, and we are of the Christian profession, and that
there are not extant any other more conspicuous and certain Monuments of their
zealous devotion toward God, then these Monasteries with their endowments, for
the maintenance of religious persons, neither any other seed-plots besides
these, from whence Christian Religion and good literature were propagated over
this our Island. Neither is there any other act of piety more acceptable in
the sight of Almighty God, then that of building Churches, Oratories, and such
like sacred edifices, for the true service of his heavenly Majesty.

Ethelbert the first Christian King of Kent, having built S. Paul's Church
London, and diverse other Churches and religious structures, as I show
hereafter, is thus commended to posterity by this Epitaph following, which
passed with applause no question in those days.

Rex Ethelbertus hic clauditur in Polyandro,
Fana pians certus Christo meat absque Meandro.
King Ethelbert lies here
closed in this Polyander,
For building Churches sure he goes
To Christ without Maeander.
^
The pious care likewise and gracious intention of our late Lord and Sovereign
King James of famous memory, had, for the repairing of the foresaid Church of
Saint Paul, and the earnest desire and purpose, which our dread Lord and
Sovereign now has (proceeding out of his zeal to Gods glory and his divine
worship) for the repairing and upholding, as his Father intended, of that
venerable large Fabric and goodly Pyle of building, will be had in
remembrance to all generations, and their names will be registered in the book
of the living.

And the munificent allowance toward the said work from William Laud, now
Lord Bishop of London, of one hundred pounds by the year, while he does
contiune there Bishop, shall be commended, and had in remembrance of all his
Successors for ever.

It may, perhaps, be distasteful to some for that I write so fully of the fall
and backsliding of Religious Persons from their primitive zealous ardour of
piety, making that the maine cause of the dissolution of Abbeyes: which I do,
for that some are of opinion, ^
that because many of these Monasteries were built upon the occasion of rapine
and blood, the Founders thereby thinking to expiate their guilt, and make
satisfaction for their sins (an error in point of Divinity) these sacred
structures howsoever consecrated to the service of Almighty God, could not
stand fast, nor continue in one and the same state for many ages; therefore I
think it meet and expedient to discover and lay open to the world, the
manifold enormities of the professed votaries residing in such religious
foundations; that it may evidently appear that it was not the sins of the
Founders (of whose pious intentions we ought to have a more reverend opinion)
that their donations were of no longer continuance but that the delinquencies
of the religious Orders themselves, were the sole cause of their own utter
subversion.

I may, perhaps, be sound fault withal, because I do not chorographically and
according as Churches stand, near or further remote in one and the same Lath
hundred or wapentack, emprint and place the Funeral Monuments in this my
book; but slip sometimes from one side of a County to another before I emprint
and Epitaph. To which give me leave to make this answer, that having found one
or two ancient Funeral inscriptions, or obliterated Sepulchers, in this or
that Parish Church, I have ridden to ten Parish Churches distant from that, and
not found one. Besides I have been taken up in diverse Churches by the
Churchwardens of the Parish, and not suffered to write the Epitaphs, or to take
view of the Monuments as I much desired, for that I wanted a Commission; which
would greatly have encouraged me (and still it would) as that of Henry the
eight did John Leyland, in the prosequution of this business.

I conclude the Epitaphs and Funeral inscriptions in this book as I find
them engraven, with a cuius anime propitietur Deus: or with God pardon his
soul; which some may say might have been as well left out of my book, as
they are in many places scraped out of the brass: And I write the Latin in
the same manner as I find it either written or imprinted, as capud for caput,
nichil for nihil, and the like; as also E vocal, for E dipthong, dipthongs
being but lately come into use. And now I hope that neither the conclusion of
the one, nor termination of the other will seem any way offensive to my
intelligent Reader.

I likewise write the Orthographie of the old English as it comes to my hands;
and if by the copying out of the same it be any manner of ways mollified, it
is much against my will, for I hold originalls the best; whereby some may
object the simplicity of my unlabored style, and the rough hewn form of my
writing. To which I reply, that this my kind of Argument is incapable of all
eloquent speech.

When I cite Ovid or Lucan, I use those exquisite translations of George
Sa^dys, and Thomas May Esquires.

Some will say, that the Epitaphs of London are already printed, and true it is
that some are, especially such as are of later times, with which I do not
meddle at all, only I set down those of more antiquity, which have either
been omitted in the collection, or for which I have some historical
elucidations, for the better understanding of the qualities of the parties
defunct and interred.

Having had the helps and collections of many, my Reader may find errors in
some, which hereafter I shall study to amend; entreating in the mean time a
favorable construction.

Many are the errataes, I am afraid, which will be found in the printing, the
greatest I have met withal I have amended, not doubting but some also of
consequence have escaped me; and for those of lesser note, I have passed them
over, desiring my Reader to correct and pardon.

Thus, courteous Reader, submitting my self, and this work, to thy learned and
friendly censure, I take my leave.

A DISCOVRSE OF Funeral Monuments, etc.
CHAP. I. Of Monuments in general.
A Monument is a thing erected, made, or written, for a memorial of some
remarkable action, fit to be transferred to future posterities And thus
generally taken, all religious Foundations, all sumptuous and magnificent
Structures, Cities, Towns, Towers, Castles, Pillars, Pyramides, Crosses,
Obeliskes, Amphitheaters, Statues, and the like, as well as Tombs and
Sepulchers, are called Monuments. Now above all remembrances (by which men have
endeavored, even in despite of death to give unto their Fames eternity) for
worthiness and continuance, books, or writings, have ever had the
pre-eminence. Marmora Maeonij vincunt monimenta libelli;
Viuitur ingenio, caetera mortis erunt.
The Muses works stone-monuments out last;
It Is wit keeps life, all else death will down cast.
Horace thus concludes the third book of his lyrick poesy. Exegi monimentum
are perennius,
Regalique situ, etc.
A monument then brass more lasting, I,
Then Princely Pyramids in site more high
Have finished, which neither fretting showers,
Nor blustering winds, nor flight of years, and hours,
Though numberless, can raze. I shall not die
Wholly; nor shall my best part buried lie
Within my Grave.
And Martial lib. 10. Ep. 2. thus speaks of books and writings. Reader my
wealth, whom when to me Rome gave;
Naught greater to bestow (quoth she) I have.
By him ungrateful Lethe thou shall fly,
And in thy better part shall never die.
Wild fig trees rend Messalla's marbles off;
Chrispus half horses the bold Carters scoff;
Writings, no age can wrong, nor theeuing hand,
Deathlesse alone those monuments will stand.
-- My books are read in every place.
Lib. 8. ep. 3.
And when Licinius, and Messalla's high
Rich marble Towers in ruined dust shall lie,
I shall be read, and strangers, every where,
Shall to their farthest homes my verses bear.


Lib. 10. Epig. 11.
And in another Ep. thus much of his books.

It Is not the City only does approve
My muse, or idle ears my verses love;
The rough Centurion, where cold frosts orespread
The Scythian fields, in war my books are read.
My lines are sung in Britain far remote;
And yet my empty purse perceiues it not.
What deathlesse numbers from my pen would flow?
What wars would my Pierian Trumpet blow?
If, as Augustus now again does live,
So Rome to me would a Mecaenas give.
In like manner Ovid gives an endless date to himself, and to his
Metamorphosis in these words. In conclu. li. vlt.


Iamque opus exegi, etc.
And now the work is ended, which, Jove's rage,
Nor Fire, nor Sword, shall raze, nor eating Age;
Come, when it will, my Deaths uncertain hour,
Which only of my body has a power:
Yet shall my better part transcend the sky;
And my immortal name shall never die:
For where-soere the Roman Eagles spread
Their conquering wings, I shall of all be read.
And if we Prophets truly can divine,
I in my living Fame shall ever shine.
S. Ierom in like manner, in one of his Epistles, writes of the perpetuity of
a funeral Elegy, which he made himself to the dear memory of his beloved
Fabiola, who was buried in the city of Bethlem; not because the said Elegy
was cut or engraven upon her Sepulcher, but for that he had written it down in
one of his volumes, according to these his own words following.

Exegi monimentum tuum aere perennius, quod nulla destruere possit vetustas;
incidi Eulogium Sepulchro tuo, quod huic volumini subdidi, vt quocunque noster
Sermo peruenerit, te laudatam; te in Bethlem condita^ Lector agnoscat.

Varus Tribune of Rome, has been and will be longer remembered by Martials
Epigram, lib. 10. ep. 26. then ever he could have been by any funeral
monument, which is lately made thus to speak English.

Varus, which as Romes Tribune did command
An hundred men, renowned in Egypt land:
Now as a stranger Ghost thou do remain
On Nilus shore, promisd to Rome in vain.
We could not dew with tears thy dying face,
Nor thy said funeral flames with odours grace;
Yet in my verse eternized shall thou be,
Of that false Egypt cannot cosen thee.
Thus Lucan lib. 9. of his own verse and Caesar's victory at Pharsalia. O
great and sacred work of poesy,
Thou freest from fate, and give eternity
To mortal wights; but, Caesar envy not
Their living names; if Roman Muses ought,
May promise thee, whilst Homer's honored,
By future times shall thou, and I, be read;
No age shall us with dark oblivion stain,
But our Pharsalia ever shall remain.
Books then and the Muses works are of all monuments the most permanent; for
of all things else there is a vicissitude, a change both of cities and nations:
as we may thus read in Ouids Metamorphosis, lib. 15.

For this we see in all is general,
Some nations gather strength, and others fall.
Troy rich and powerful, which so proudly stood,
That could for ten years spend such streams of blood;
For buildings only her old ruins shows,
For riches, Tombs, which slaughtered fires enclose,
Sparta, Mycenae, were of Greece the flowers;
So Cecrops city, and Amphions Towers:
Now glorious Sparta lies upon the ground;
Lofty Mycenae hardly to be found.
Of Oedipus his Thebes what now remains;
Or of Pandions Athens, but their names?
Thebes, 1. Siluester, Transl.
Babell, Rome, these proud heaven daring wonders,
Lo under ground in dust and ashes lie,
For earthly kingdoms, even as men do die.
Bellay in his ruins of Rome, translated by Spenser, makes this demonstration
or show of that city, to the strange country man or traveler: Thou stranger,
which for Rome in Rome here seek;
And naught of Rome in Rome perceiu'st at all,
These same old walls, old arches, which thou see,
Old palaces, is that which Rome men call.
Behold what wreake, what ruin, and what wast,
And how that she, which with her mighty power
Tamed all the world, has tamed her self at last:
The prey of Time, which all things does devour.
Rome now of Rome, is the only funeral,
And only Rome, of Rome has victory.
Ne ought save Tyber hastening to his fall
Remains of all: O worlds inconstancy.
That which is firm, does flit and fall away,
And that is flitting, does abide and stay.


It is a vanity for a man to think to perpetuate his name and memory by
strange and costly great Edifices, for Not sumptuous Pyramids to skies vpreard;
Nor Elean Jove's proud Fane, Proper^ lib. 3. El. 2.
which heaven compeerd,
Nor the rich fortune of Mausoleus Tomb,
Are priuiledg'd from deaths extremest doom:
Or fire, or storms, their glories do abate,
Or by age shaken, fall with their own weight.
We have many examples here in England of the small continuance (as I may so
call it) of magnificent strong buildings, by the sudden fall of our religious
houses, of which a late namelesse versifier has thus written: What sacred
structures did our Elders build,
Wherein Religion gorgeously sat decked?
Now all thrown down, Religion exild,
Made Brothell-houses, had in base respect,
Or ruind so that to the viewers eye,
In their own ruins they intombed lie:
The marble vrnes of their so zealous Founders
Are dug up, and turned to sordid uses;
Their bodies are quite cast out of their bounders
Lie vn^interr'd. O greater what abuse is?
Yet in this later age we now live in,
This barbarous act is neither shame nor sin.
Of walls, towers, castles, crosses, forts, rampires, towns, cities, and such
like monuments, here in great Britain, which by age, wars, or the malignitie
of the times, are defaced, ruined, or utterly subverted, you may read in
learned Camden: only thus much out of famous Spenser, personating the Genius
of Verlame, or Verulam, sometimes a city near to S. Albons. Ruins of Time.
I was that City which the garland wore
Of Britains pride, delivered unto me,
By Roman victors, which it won of yore;
Though naught at all but ruins now I be.
And lie in mine own ashes as ye see.
Verlame I was, what boots it that I was,
Since now I am but weeds and wastfull grass?
Another English muse (now living) under the name of Watling, M. ^rayton, P^l.
Song. xvi.
one of the four imperial high ways sings thus of the ruins of this city.

Thou saw when Verlam once her head aloft did rear,
Which in her cinders now lies sadly buried here:
With Alabaster, Tuch, and Porphery adornd,
When (welneare) in her pride great Troinouant she scornd.
Likewise upon this forgotten City a namelesse late writer has made this
Epitaph.

Stay thy foot that passest by,
Here is wonder to descry,
Churches that interred the dead,
Here themselves are sepulchred;
Houses, where men slept and wak't,
Here in ashes vnder-rak't.
In a word to allude;
Here is corn where once Troy stood;
Or more fully home to have,
Here Is a City in a grave.
Reader wonder think it then,
Cities thus would die like men:
And yet wonder think it none,
Many Cities thus are gone.
But I will conclude this Chapter with these two stanzaes following, taken out
of Spensers poem aforesaid, speaking of the vanity of such Princes who (
Absolon like) think to gain a perpetuity after death, by erecting of
pillars, and such like monuments, to keep their names in remembrance* when as
it is only the Muses works which give unto man immortality.

In vain do earthly Princes then, in vain,
Seek with Pyramides, to heaven aspired;
Or huge Colosses, built with costly pain;
Or brazen pillars, never to be fired;
Or Shrines, made of the metal most desired,
To make their memories for ever live:
For how can mortal immortality give.
For deeds do die, how ever nobly done,
And thoughts of men do in themselves decay,
But wise words taught in numbers for to run,
Recorded by the Muses, live for aye;
Ne may with storming showers be washed away,
Ne bitter breathing winds with harmfull blast,
Nor age, nor envy, shall them ever wast.
CHAP. II. Of Funeral Monuments, Graves, Tombs, or Sepulchers. Of the ancient
custom of burialls. Of Epitaphs, and other funeral honors.
NOw to speak properly of a Monument, as it is here in this my ensuing
Treatise understood, it is a receptacle or sepulcher, purposely made, erected,
or built, to receive a dead corpse, and to preserve the same from violation.
Scipio Gentilis lib. Orig. sing.
Nam monumentum Sepulchri, est, quod causa muniendi eius loci factum sit, in
quo corpus impositum sit, vnde Monumentum quasi munimentum dicitur.

And indeed these Funeral Monuments, in foregoing ages, were very fittingly
called muniments, in that they did defend and fence the corpse of the defunct,
which otherwise might have been pulled out of their graves by the savage
brutishness of wild beasts: for as then none were buried in Towns or Cities,
but either in the fields, along the high way side (to put passengers in mind,
that they were like those so interred, mortal) upon the top, or at the feet of
mountains. Apud maiores (says Seruiu^ lib. xi. Aeneid.) aut sub montibus, aut
in ipsis montibus sepeliebantur, vnde natum est, vt super cadauera aut
pyramides fierent, aut ingentes collocarentur columnae.

The Romans were forbidden by this the second Law of their twelve Tables.
Hominem mortuum in vrbe ne sepelito neve vrito: to bury or burn any within any
Town or City.

For the ancient custom of burial amongst the Jews, we read, that Abraham
was buried with Sara his wife, in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephron,
Genesis cap. 25.

And Vzziah king of Judah, slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
fathers, in the field of the burial which pertained to the kings. 2. Chron.
cap. 26.

The sepulcher of Lazarus was without the city of Bethania: and so was that of
Joseph without Jerusalem.

Sandys in the relation of his long journey, tells us, that he was showed the
Tomb of the Prophet Samuel, as also the Sepulcher of the seven brethren (who
were tortured to death by Antiochus) fenced about with a pile of stones,
square, flat, and solid, both of them being on the top of two mountains, near
unto the city of Emmaus; and in the vineyards on the North-west side of the
said city, sundry places of burial, hewne out of the maine rock, amongst the
rest, one called the Sepulcher of the Prophets.

And those Egyptian lofty proud Pyramids (the barbarous wonders of vain cost)
so universally celebrated, being the Regal sepulchers of the Ptolomees, were
erected far out of all cities, as the said Traveler tells us, who did see so
much of the ruins thereof, as time has not devoured.

The Athenians buried such as were slain in battle, and other honorable
personages, in a place without the City called Ceramnicus.

So here in England, the interments of the dead were anciently far out of all
Towns and Cities, either on the ridges of hills, or upon spacious plains,
fortified or fenced about, with obelisks, pointed stones, Pyramids, pillars, or
such like monuments; for example, Englands wonder upon Salisbury-plaine, called
Stonehenge, the sepulcher of so many Britains, who by the treachery of the
Saxons, were slain there at a parley. That of Wada the Saxon Duke near to
Whitby in Yorkshire, and those of Cartigerne the Britain, and Horsa the Saxon,
near to Ailesford in Kent.

It was a thing usual among our old Saxon ancestors (says Verstegan) as by
Tacitus it also seems to have been among the other Germans, that the dead
bodies of such as were slain in the field, and buried in the fields, were not
laid in graves, but lying upon the ground, were covered over with turns,
clods, or sods of earth; And the more in reputation the persons had been, the
greater and higher were the turns raised over their bodies: and this some used
to call Byriging, some Beorging, and some Buriging of the dead, which we now
call berying, or burying of the dead, which properly is a shrowding or an
hiding of the dead body in the earth. Of these kind of funeral monuments you
have many upon Salisbury-plaine, out of which the bones of bodies thus inhum'd
are oftentimes dug up; which the Inhabitants thereabout call Beries, Baroes,
and some Burrowes, which accords with the same fence of Byrighs, Beorghs, or
Burghs. From whence the names of diverse Towns and Cities are originally
derived; Places first so called, having been with walls of turfe or clods of
earth, fenced about for men to be shrouded in, as in forts or Castles.

Reutha, King of that neuer-conquered terrible, fierce Nation of the Scots (who
flourished about they ear of the world 3784. and before the birth of our
blessed Savior, one hundred eighty and seven years) ordained, That such
Noblemen which had achieved any notable exploit in defense of their country,
should be had in perpetual memory, and buried, in solemn wise, in
sepulchers aloft upon hills, or mountains, upon which were set so many
Obelisks, pillars, or long-pointed stones, as they had slain enemies in the
wars. Whereof some remain (says Hector Boethius in the life of the said
King) there to be seen even to this day.

Sepulchers of this stately kind of structure for persons of eminent rank and
quality, were sometimes (howsoever) erected within the cities: for we read
in the first book of the Maccabees, Chap. 13. that Jonathan the valiant
(brother to Judas the worthy) being slain in battle near to Baschama, and
there buried, Simon sent to take the bones of his brother Jonathan (I will use
the words of the Text) And they buried him in Modin his fathers city. And all
Israel bewailed him with great lamentation, and mourned for him very long. And
Simon made upon the Sepulcher of his father, and his brethren, a building high
to look unto, of hewne stone behind and before. And set up seven pillars upon
it, one against another, for his father, his mother, and four brethren: And
set great pillars round about them, and set arms upon the pillars for a
perpetual memory, and carved ships beside the arms, that they might be seen
of men sailing in the sea.

In like manner the Romans (notwithstanding their second law of the twelve
Tables) did sometime entombe their dead within the City (but that was but
seldom;) for the bones and ashes of Trajan the Emperor, were put into a
golden vrne, and set in the Marketplace, upon the top of a pillar, of one
whole piece, being one hundred and forty foot high.

And Galbaes body long neglected (says Tacitus) and in the dark
despightfully entreated; Argius his Steward, one of his principal bondmen,
buried with small ceremony in his private garden. But this was not usual
amongst them.

Hospinian lib. 3. cap. 1. out of Durandus, Vlpian, and other Authors, gives
this reason: wherefore both the Jews and Gentiles used to bury their dead,
without the gates of Towns and Cities. It was a custom in times of old (says
he) that men and women were buried in their own private houses, or within
their own private gardens; but afterward for the noisome savor, and
contagious stink of the dead carkases so interred, it was enacted, That all
burials should be without Towns and Cities, in some convenient place
appointed for that purpose. And howsoever that this order was observed by the
Gentiles upon this reason only, Scilicet vt in vrbibus mundicies seruaretur,
and aer minus inficeretur, ex cadauerum putrescentium faetore; Yet the true
Christians, and such as by their lively faith were adopted the children of God,
had a further mystery in this their manner of interments; for by the carriage
and burial of their dead corpse without their city walls, they did publicly
confirm, and witness, that the parties deceased were gone out of this world,
to be made free denizons of another city, namely, Heaven, there to remain
with the blessed Saints in eternal happiness.

This order or custom of burial without cities, continued amongst the
Christians, until the time of Gregory the great, for as then the Monks,
Friars, and Priests (says my foresaid Author) began to offer sacrifice for
the souls departed; so that, for their more easy and greater profit, they
procured first, that the places of sepulture should be adjoining unto their
Churches, and afterward they got license to bury within Churches. Upon this
reason out of the said Gregory 13. q. cap. 2. Cum grauia peccata non deprimunt
(says he) tunc prodest mortuis si in Ecclesijs sepeliantur; quia eorum
proximi, quoties ad eadem sacra loca veniunt, suorumque sepulturam aspiciunt,
recordantur and pro eis Domino preces fundunt.

Panuinius in lideritu sepeliend. mortuos.
Antiquitus tantum extra vrbem in coemiterijs hominu^ corpora sepeliebantur,
pace Ecclesiae data intra vrbes, ad Templorum limina, postea etiam in ipsis
templis sepeliri mos inualuit. Constantinus in porticu Templi Apostolorum,
Constantinopoli: Honorius in porticu Templi S. Petri Romae, eius vxor intra
idem Templum sepulti sunt.

Anciently the bodies of the dead were buried only without cities in
Coemiteries or sleeping places, until the resurrection (as the word signifies)
but persecution being ended, and peace given to the Christian Church, the
manner grew in use to bury within Cities, at the entrance into their sacred
temples, yea and afterward in the very Churches themselves. Constantine was
buried in the porch of the Apostles in Constantinople. Honorius in the porch of
S. Peter in Rome; and his wife (the Empress) within the said Church. But to
come nearer home, Austine the first Archbishop of Canterbury, sent hither by
the foresaid Gregory, was interred in the porch of Saint Peter and Paul,
commonly called Saint Austins near unto Canterbury, a religious house of his
own foundation, and together with him six other Archbishops who next
succeeded him: whose relics afterward were removed into the Abbey Church, of
which I shall speak hereafter.

Cuthbert or Cudbright th'eleuenth, Archbishop of that Province, obtained from
the Pope a dispensation, for the making of Coemiteries or Churchyards within
Towns, and Cities, whereas, here in England, until his time, within the walls
thereof none were buried. These following are the words in the Appendix to the
book of Rochester a Mss. in Sir Robert Cottons Library.

Cutbertus Archiepiscopus Cant. xi. ab Augustino cum Romae videret plures intra
Civitates sepeliri, rogauit Papam ut sibi liceret Coemiteria facere, quod Papa
annuit, reuersus itaque coemiteria vbique in Anglia fieri constituit.

This order of burial being thus begun here in England, it likewise followed,
that Graue-stones were made, and Tombs erected with inscriptions engraven upon
them, to continue the remembrance of the parties deceased, to succeeding ages;
and these were called Epitaphs: now, an Epitaph is a superscription (either in
verse or prose) or an astrict pithie Diagram, writ, carved, or engraven, upon
the tomb, grave, or sepulcher of the defunct, briefly declaring (and that
sometimes with a kind of commiseration) the name, the age, the deserts, the
dignities, the state, the praises both of body and mind, the good or bad
fortunes in the life, and the manner and time of the death of the person
therein interred.

Of all funeral honors (says Camden) Epitaphs have always been most
respective; for in them love was showed to the deceased, memory was continued
to posterity, friends were comforted, and the Reader pu^ in mind of humane
frailty: and indeed the frequent visiting, and advised reuiewing of the Tombs
and monuments of the dead (but without all touch of superstition) with the
often reading, serious perusal, and diligent meditation of wise and religious
Epitaphs or inscriptions, found upon the tombs or monuments, of persons of
approved virtue, merit, and honor, is a great motive to bring us to
repentance. The invention of Epitaphs proceeded from the presage or forefeeling
of immortality, implanted in all men naturally, and is referred to the
Scholars of Linus the Theban Poet, who flourished about the year of the world
2700) who first bewailed this Linus their master, when he was slain, in
doleful verses, then called of him Aelina, afterward Epitaphia, for that they
were first song at burialls, after engraued upon the sepulchers. Funeral
monuments then of costly workmanship, with curious engraven Epitaphs, were
called Sepulchra, id est, semipulchra, half fair and beautiful; the
external part or superficies thereof being gloriously beautified and adorned;
and having nothing within, but dreadful darkness, loathsome stink, and
rottenness of bones, as it is in the Gospel, Mat. 23. And they are sometimes
called memories, a memoria vel a monendo, in that by them we are put in mind,
and warned to consider our fragile condition; for they are external helps to
excite, and stir up our inward thoughts, habere memoriam mortis semper prae
oculis: to have the remembrance of death ever before our eyes, and that our
brethren defunct, may not be out of mind as out of sight.

Non ob aliud, says S. Austin in his book De cura pro mortuis, vel memoriae
vel monumenta dicuntur, ea quae insignita siunt Sepulchra mortuorum, nisi quia
eos, qui viuentium oculis morte subtracti sunt, ne obliuione etiam cordibus
subtrahantur, in memoriam reuocant, and admonendo faciunt cogitari: Nam and
memoriae nomen id apertissime ostendit, and monumentum eo quod moneat mentem,
id est admoneat nuncupatur.

In the Register of the Gray Friars London, I find this definition of a
funeral monument much what to the same effect.

Monimentum est quasi monens mentem, ^
and sic solet a doctoribus etymologiari: monet namque bifarie humanam mentem,
cum aut mortis memoriam incutit visis precedentium sepulchris; aut eisdem
conspectis, mentes moneantur sieve moueantur carorum, ad reddend. suffragia pro
ipsis.

These tombs or sepulchers were also named, Requtatoria, Ossuaria, Cineraria,
domus aeternae, etc. as you have them with their several significations in
Kirkman, De Funeribus Romanorum.

Tertullian (in his book De Resurrectione carnis, cap. 37.) calls these
monuments of the dead, Cadauerum stabula, stables or stalls of carcases. Nemo
iam poterit aliud mortuos interpretari, qui sunt in monimentis, nisi corpora
and carnem, quia nec ipsa monimenta aliud, quam cadaverum stabula: which Lucian
scoffingly termed camps and cottages of carcases.

But to conclude this Chapter; R^maines.
the place of burial was called by S. Paul, Seminatio, in the respect of the
assured hope of resurrection: of the Greeke^ Coemiterion, as a sleeping place
until the resurrection: and of the Hebrews* The house of the living, in the
same respect, as the Germans call Churchyards until this day, Gods aker, or
Gods field.

CHAP. III. Of Sepulchers answerable to the degree of the person deceased. The
diverse manner of bearing man and woman to the Grave. When both Sexes began to
be borne alike.
Sepulchers should be made according to the quality and degree of the person
deceased, that by the Tomb every one might be discerned of what rank he was
living: for monuments answerable to men's worth, states and places, Camd.
Remains.
have always been allowed, and stately sepulchers for base fellows have
always lien open to bitter jests; therefore it was the use and custom of
reverend antiquity, to interre persons of the rusticke or plebeian sort, in
Christian burial, without any further remembrance of them, either by tomb,
grauestone, or epitaph. Persons of the meaner sort of Gentry, were interred
with a flat grauestone, comprehending the name of the defunct, the year and
day of his decease, with other particulars, which was engraven on the said
stone, or upon some plate. And Gentlemen, which were of more eminency, had
their effigies or representation, cut or carved upon a Term or Pedestall, as
it were of a pillar, raised somewhat above the ground, vmbelico tenus: and this
image had no arms, but was formed from the waste upwards upon a Term, which
did bear a true resemblance of the favor of the party defunct Upon the said
term (commonly) were inserted, the name, progeny, match, issue, vocation, and
employment of the defunct, with the day, year, and place of his death.

Noble men, Princes, and Kings had (as it befitteth them, and as some of them
have at this day) their Tombs or Sepulchers raised aloft above ground, to note
the excellency of their state and dignity; and withal, their personages
delineated, carved, and embost, at the full length and bigness, truly
proportioned throughout, as near to the life, and with as much state and
magnificence, as the skill of the Artificer could possibly carue and form the
same: the materials of which were alabaster, rich marble, touch, rauce,
porpherey, polisht brass or copper, like unto that made to the memory of King
Henry the seventh in Westminster, who dwells more richly dead (says Viscount
Saint Alban in his history of that kings reign) in the monument of his Tomb,
then he did alive in Richmond or any of his palaces, it being the stateliest,
and most curious dainty monument of Europe, both for the Chapel, and for the
Sepu^chre.

And as stately monuments were not due, nor allowed* to every man that was of
ability to erect the same; so swelling titles, lofty inscriptions or epitaphs,
were prohibited to be inscribed, insculpt, or engraven upon the sepulchers of
men of mean desert: but only upon the monuments of such as were of virtue,
wisdom, and valor* as martial men, or persons of eminent place of
government in the weal public. Which is not observed altogether in these
times: for by some of our epitaphs more honor is attributed to a rich quondam
Tradesman, or griping usurer, then is given to the greatest Potentate entombed
in Westminster: and their tombs are made so huge great, that they take up the
Church, and hinder the people from divine Service. Besides if one shall
seriously suruay the Tombs erected in these our days, and examine the
particulars of the personages wrought upon their Tombs, he may easily
discern the vanity of our minds, veiled under our fantastic habits and
attires, which in time to come will be rather prouocations to vice, then
incitations to virtue; and so the Temple of God shall become a Schoolehouse of
the monstrous habits and attires of our present age, wherein Tailors may find
out new fashions. And which is worse, they garnish their Tombs, now adays,
with the pictures of naked men and women; raising out of the dust, and bringing
into the Church, the memories of the heathen gods and goddesses, with all their
whirligiggs: and this (as I take it) is more the fault of the Tombe-makers,
then theirs who set them a work.

There was likewise made a difference of personages in the carriage of their
dead bodies to the place of sepulture, according to their state and dignity.
Great men of birth or quality were carrried in chariots drawn with horses,
trumpets and several sorts of musical instruments sounding before the corpse;
mourners, and likewise many who sung mournful ditties in praise of the
defunct: to whose further honor they did also set up in their Temples, and
other public places, certain ornaments, as scutcheo^s, crowns, and such
like: of which pompous progression more in the next Chapter. Now such as could
not be interred with all this maiesticke solemnity, although they were of high
parentage, for that the charge was very great, were buried in the evening by
certain men who had that charge, who were called Vespillons.

Men of meaner rank, howsoever never so rich, were not allowed this princely
kind of production to their graves; for their corpse were borne upon their
servants shoulders, whom they had manumitted a little before their deaths, with
a Trumpet only sounding before them, and some lights, according to this of
Persius, Satyr 3. Then were prepared for his Funeral
The Trumpet, and the Lights: And last of all
This seeming happy man, that would not doubt
His health, being composedly laid out
On his high bed, his biere; and now daubed over,
And even bedurted with th'abundant store
Of ointments; stretches towered the city gate
His cold dead heels; and those whose best estate
But yesterday, was but to be his slave,
Now wear their caps, and bear him to his grave.
Man and woman, though of equal degree and quality, were borne in a different
manner to their graves. Man was borne upon men's shoulders to signify his
dignity and superiority over his wife; and woman at the arms end, to
signify, that being inferior to man, in her life time, she should not be
equalled with him at her death. Which use continued a long time, until women,
by renouncing the world, and living monastical religious lives, got such an
honorable esteem in the world, that they were thought no less worthy of
honor, in that kind, then men; and when as a widow d^ed having h^d but one
husband, they carried her to her grave with a crown of chastity upon her head.

Condemned persons (as they are now adays) were carried in waines or carts,
because they were thought unworthy to be borne by men, who, by their wicked
demerits, had procured the hand of justice to cut them off, by untimely death,
from the society of men.

CHAP. IIII. Of the excessive expenses bestowed at Funerals in former times.
I Might include within this Chapter, and not impertinently, to these contents,
the ancient customs, and manners of burying the dead, in all Nations,
throughout all the habitable world: but that would make the gate bigger then
the city, this discourse of a greater bulk, then all the rest of the book
besides: you may find this Treatise touched upon, in the Volumne of the
Estates, Empires, and Principalities of the world; as also in the Treasury of
Ancient and modern Times, the sixth book; where he speaks of diverse
customs and fashions of burial, of ancient obsequies, and their ceremonies;
only then a little of so much, because I would not stray beyond my limits.

The ancient Romans did use them that were dead after two manners, and they
had two kinds of obsequies: the first and most ancient was to cover the dead
with earth, and to bury them as we do; the other, to burn their bodies, but
this manner did not continue long. Sepeliri antiquius fuisse quam cremari.
Plin. lib. 7. cap. 54. Cremari apud Romanos non suit ve^eris instituti, terra
condebantur: at postquam longinquis hellis obrutos eru^ cognouere, est
institutum, and tamen multae familiae priscos seruauere ritus. Manut. de leg.
Romans sol. 125. Numa Pompilius was the inuenter of obsequies, and he instituted
a high Priest, who had the charge. The first honor which they used to perform
in the obsequies of famous persons, was to commend the party by an Oration.
Valerius Publicola made a funeral oration on the death and in the praise of
Brutus. In like manner Julius Caesar, being but twelve years old, commended
his grandfather: and Tiberius at the age of nine years praised his father. The
second honor was to make Sword-players to fight. Marcus and Decius sons to
Iunius Brutus, were the first that did practice this, in honor of their
father. The third honor was, to make a feast of magnificent furnishment. The
fourth was a distribution of meat to all the common people. And such (as I have
said before) as could not be buried with the like, and so great pomp (for the
expenses were in supportable) were buried in the night time, by the Vespillons
clothed all in white, who carried the dead body to his grave. They had likewise
an order, that within some while after the obsequies, they would strew diverse
flowers, and sweet odours, upon the sepulcher, as the Roman people did upon
the funeral monument of Scipio. And also they accustomed yearly, to garnish,
deck, and adorn, the tombs or graves of the dead, with poesies, crowns, and
garlands of all sorts of flowers. Husbands (says Saint Ierom ad Pammachum)
were wont to straw, spread, or scatter over, and upon the graves and sepulchers
of their deceased dear wives, violets, roses, lillies, hyacinths, and diverse
purple flowers: by which vxorious office, they did mitigate, and lessen the
grief of their hearts conceived by the loss of their loving bedf^llowes. The
like expression of mutual love wives showed to their buried husbands.

Now above all flowers in these ceremonious obseruances, the Rose was in
greatest request, and had the sole pre-eminence. Romani (says Kirkman de
Funeribus Romanorum, lib. 4. cap. 3.) vero Rosarum fuere studiosi, vt ijs post
mortem monimenta sua spargi supremo iudicio nonnunquam iusserint, legato ad
hanc rem relict^, cui plerumque haec erat conditio (ut in Rauennati
inscriptione legimus) vt quotannis Rosas ad monumentum eius de^errent, ibique
epularentur. To which Io. Passeratius in his Rosa, thus alludes.

Manibus est imis Rosa grata, and grata Sepulchris,
Et Rosa flos Florum.
Unto the Tombs and Spirits of the dead
The Rose is grateful, of all flowers the head.
And Anacreon in praise of the Rose thus sings in one of his odes: I will use
the Latin translation. Rosa, honor, decusque florum
Rosa, cura amorque veris
Rosa, coelitum voluptas:
And in another ode in commendation of the Rose more aptly to this purpose,
thus.

Medicatur haec and aegris,
Defendit haec sepultos*
The Rose full many griefs does cure,
Defends corpse laid in sepulture.
The ancient Ethnicks did hold the springing of flowers, from the grave of a
deceased friend, an argument of his happiness; and it was their universal
wish, That the Tomb stones of their dead friends might be light unto them;
and that a perpetual springtide, of all kind of fragrant flowers, might
incircle their verdant graves. According to this of Persius. Sat. 7.

Dij maiorum vmbris tenuem and sine pondere terram
Spirantesque crocos, and in vrna perpetuum ver.
Lie earth light on their bones, may their graves bear
Fresh fragrant flowers: let springtide still live there.
But to come back again. The magnificence in burning the bodies of the dead,
did far exceed in charges all other kinds of funeral; for which the bodies
of persons of principal regard (as you may read in the Trauelles of George
Sandys) they burnt rich odours, gold, jewels, apparel, herds of cattle,
flocks of sheep, horses, hounds, and sometimes the concubines and slaves whom
they most respected, to supply their wants, to serve their delights, and attend
upon them in the lower shades. The express^ of such a funeral fire, wherein
the body of Archemorus was consumed, is thus set down by Statius the Theban;
in his sixth book, translated by Sandys.

Never were ashes with more wealth repleate;
Gems crackle, silver melts, gold drops with heat:
Embroidered robes consume. Oaks, fatned by
The juice of sweet Assyrian drugs, flame hie:
Fyer'd honey, and pale saffron hiss: full boules
Of wine poured on, and goblets (gladding souls)
Of black blood, and snatched milk. The Greek Kings then
With Guidons trail'd on earth, led forth their men
In seven troops: in each troop an hundred Knights
Circling the sad pile with sinister rites:
Who choke the flame with dust. Thrice it they round
Their weapons clash: four times a horrid sound
Struck armours raisde: as often the Servants beat
Their bared breasts, with outcries. Herds of Neat,
And beasts half slain, another wastfull fire
Deuoures, etc.
With the like solemnity, or far greater, the funerals of Patroclus were
performed by Achilles, for with him were burned, oxen, sheep, dogs, horses,
and twelve stout and valiant sons of noble Trojans. Achilles pulls off the
hair off his head, and casts it into the flame; and besides institutes
certain Funeral Games to the honor of his slain friend, the glory of the
Greekish Nation, Patroclus which is recorded by Homer in the 23. book of his
Iliads; of which this is the argument: Achilles orders iusts of Obsequies,
For his Patroclus, and does sacrifice
Twelve Trojan Princes: most loved hounds, and horse,
And other offering to the honored corse.
He institutes besides a Funeral Game,
Where Diomed for horse-race wins the same.
For foot, Ulysses; other otherwise
Strive, and obtain, and end the Exequies.
They used to quench these funeral fires with red wine, and gathering the
bones together, to include them in vrnes, which they placed in or upon some
sumptuous rich Monument, erected for that purpose, as you may read in the
sixth book of Virgils Aen^iads, Aene^^ (...) Trump(...).
in the funerals of Misenus, most lively thus expressed. I will use Phaers
Translation.

-- the Trojans all in solemn guise
Did wail Misenus corpse, and gave to him their last outcries.
First cut in culpons great, and fat of sap, with pitch among,
A stately pile they build, with timber trees and Cypress strong,
(That dead men's treasure is) his gorgeous arms also they set;
Some brought the water warm, and Cauldrons boiling out they set.
The body cold they wash, and precious ointments on they pour;
Lamenting loud is made, then close his limbs in bed, or floor,
They crouch with weeping tears, and purple weeds on him they throw:
His robes, his harne is bright, and ensigns all that men may know.
In mourning sort some heave on shoulders high the mighty Beer,
(A doleful service sad) as children do their father dear,
Behind them holding brands, then flame vprising broad does spread,
And oiles and dainties cast, and Frankincence the fire does feed.
When fallen his cinders were, and longer blase did not endure;
His relics and remains of dust, with wine they washed pure,
Then Choriney his bones in brazen coffin bright did close.
And sprinkling water pure, about his mates three times he goes:
And drops of sacred dew, with Oliue-palmes on them did shake,
And compass blessed them all, and sentence last he sadly spoke:
To fields of joy thy soul, and endless rest we do betake.
But good Aeneas then, right huge in height his Tomb did rere,
And gave the Lord his Arms, his Ore and Trumpet fixed there,
On mountain near the skies, that of Misenus bears the name,
And everlasting shall from world to world retain the same.
Many more ceremonies were observed in the magnificent ordering of both kinds
of Funerals, as well of such as were buried in the earth, as of these burned
in these costly piles of wood. The custom of burning the dead bodies continued
among the Romans, but until the time of the Antonine Emperors, An Do 200. or
thereabouts: then they began to bury again in the earth. Manutius de log.

They had, at these burials, suborned counterfeit hired mourners, which were
women of the loudest voices, who betimes in the morning did mere at appointed
places, and then cried out mainly, beating of their breasts, tearing their
hair, their faces, and garments, joining therewith the prayers of the defunct,
from the hour of his nativity, unto the hour of his dissolution; still
keeping time with the melancholicke music. (This is a custom observed at
this day in some parts of Ireland, but above all Nations the Jews are best
skilled in these lamentations, being Fruitful in tears: Inuen. (...)
tears, that still ready stand
To sally forth, and but expect command.)
Amongst these women there was ever an old aged Beldam, Rosin. de Autin Romano.
(...) l. ^. cap. 59.
called Praefica, quasi in hoc ipso manus praefecta, a superintendent above all
the rest of the mourners: who with a loud voice did pronounce these words: I
licet, or, Ire licet; as much to say, He must needs depart: and when the dead
corpse were lain in the grave, and all ceremonies finished, she deliuerd the
last adieu in this manner, Vale, vale, vale, nos te ordine, quo natura
permiserit, cuncti sequemur: Adieu, Adieu, Adieu, we must follow thee,
according as the course of nature shall permit us.

The manner of these lamentings (says George Sandys in his Journall) may of
old appear by this ironicall personating of a father following the exequies of
his son, introducted by Lucian in these words: O my sweet son, thou art
lost, thou art dead: dead before thy day, and have left me behind, of men the
most miserable. Not experienced in the pleasures of a wife, the comforts of
children, warfare, husbandry, nor attained to maturitie. Henceforth, O my
son, thou shall not eat, nor love, nor be drunk amongst thy equals. They
had likewise their Libitinarij (and those many in number) which were the
prouiders of all things necessary for the Funerals; and their Pollinctores,
which were those that anointed, embalmed, and invested the defunct, with
mirrhe, aloes, salt, honey, wax, sweet odours, precious oils, perfumed
sereclothes, fine Aromaticke Sindon, and the like. The mourners were exceeding
many, (of which I have partly spoken before) with Trumpeters, and Musicians of
all sorts, most dolefully sounding, and warbling forth their lamentable notes:
the corpse of the defunct being guarded, and attended upon, with troops of
horsemen, which was accounted an extraordinary kind of honor done to the
deceased: then last of all, Funeral Games, Bonefires of most precious woods,
Orations, magnificent, sumptuous, and most royal feasts and banquets were
ordained.

But these excessive charges, these superfluous and impertinent costs of
funeral expenses, were by certain Laws restrained, both by the Romans, and
Grecians, and funeral charges proportioned, according to the worthiness of
the person deceased, and his means; answerable to the valuation of his yearly
revenues, or the general estimate of his substance.

In like manner these Ethnicke lamentations, and fearful howlings for the
dead, by hired mourners, were prohibited; yet moderate weeping and mourning at
Funerals, was never dissallowed; nay it has been ever highly commended,
accounted the chief grace of Funerals, promised for a blessing to the godly,
and the want thereof, a malediction or curse; and moderately to mourn after
the interment of our friends, is a manifest token of true love; by it we
express that natural affection we had to the departed, with a Christian-like
moderation of our grief, whereby our faith to God ward is demonstrated. For as
God has made us living, so has he made us loving creatures, to the end we
should not be as stocks and stones, void of all kind and natural affection,
but that living and loving together, the love of the one should not end with
the life of the other. And now to go a little further, I say, that to mourn
and sorrow for parents, children, husbands, wives, kindred and friends, is not
any matter of novelty but most ancient. Genesis 1^.
Abraham mourned and wept for his wife Sarah: David could not hide his fatherly
affection toward his son Absolon; although he was a traitor to his father,
2. Sam. 18.
David the King: for so soon as he heard of his death, he went up to the
chamber over the gate (as the text is) and wept: and as he went, thus he said,
O my son Absolon, my son, my son Absolon, would God I had died for thee,
O Absolon, my son, my son.

David also hearing of the death of murdered Abner, whom he respected as a
dear friend: said unto Ioab (who slew Abner) and to all the people that were
with him, 2* Sam. 5.
Rent your clothes and put on sackcloth, and mourn, before the corpse of Abner:
and king David himself followed the Beer. And when they had buried Abner in
Hebron, the king lifted up his voice, and wept beside the Sepulcher of Abner,
and all the people wept.

Now, it being the custom of the Israelites to feast and banquet at their
burials; ^he people came to cause David (such is the Scripture phrase) to eat
meat while it was yet day, but David swear, saying, So do God to me and more
also, if I taste bread, or ought else till the Sun be down: and a^l the
people knew it, and it pleased them, says the Text.

Our a^l perfect and Almighty Savior Christ Jesus, Ioh. 11.
wept over the grave of dead Lazarus (whom he revived) whereupon the standers by
said among themselves, behold how he loved him.

The ancient Romans, before they were Christians, mourned nine months, but
being Christians, they used mourning a whole year, clothed in black for the
most part, for women were clothed partly in white, and partly in black,
according to the diversity of Nations. And if any Christian, man, or woman, in
those parts, wearing mourning, came to agree again in a second marriage,
during the year appointed for mourning, the Matrimony was stayed, but
thenceforward he nor she were bound to wear any more mourning.

These examples considered, I observe that we, in these days, do not weep
and mourn at the departure of the dead, so much, nor so long, as in Christian
duty we ought. For husbands can bury their wives, and wives their husbands,
with a few counterfeit tears, and a sour visage masked and painted over with
dissimulation; contracting second marriages, before they have worn out their
mourning garments, and sometimes before their cope mates be cold in their
graves.

Young heirs may attend upon the corpse of their parents to their burial
places, seemingly making great shows of inward grief and sorrow, but Haeredis
flectus sub persona risus est. Aul. G^ll. Noct. At. lib. 17. c. 14.

The weeping of an heir, is laughing under a visard or disguise.

And if his father have impaired, or not augmented his state and inheritance,
this young master will reduce the conuoy of his fathers obsequies, to some
unwonted parsimonie, answerable to these verses of Persius in the sixth and
last Satyr.

-- if thou impair thy wealth, thy angered heir
Of thy last funeral feast will take small care:
And with neglect into thy vrne will throw
Thy bones without perfumes, careless to know
Whether he buy dull-smelling Cinnamum,
Or Casia corrupt with cherry gum.
Now howsoever the procuration of funerals, the manner of burial, the pomp of
obsequies, be rather comforts to the living, then helps to the dead; and
although all these ceremonies be despised by our parents on their deathbeds;
yet should they not be neglected by us their children, or nearest of kindred,
upon their interments.

But funerals in any expensiue way here with us, are now accounted but as a
fruitless vanity, insomuch that almost all the ceremonial rites of obsequies
heretofore used, are altogether laid aside: for we see daily that Noblemen,
and Gentlemen of eminent rank, office, and quality, are either silently
buried in the night time, with a Torch, a two-penie Link, and a Lantern; or
parsimoniously interred in the daytime, by the help of some ignorant
countrey-painter, without the attendance of any one of the Officers of Arms,
whose chiefest support, and maintenance, has ever depended upon the
performance of such funeral rites, and exequies. So that now by reason of this
general neglect of Funerals, and the slight regard we have of the needful
use of Heralds, many and great errors are daily committed, to the great
offense and prejudice of the ancient Nobility, and Gentry of this Kingdom,
and to the breeding of many ambiguous doubts and questions, which may happen in
their Descents, and issues in future ages: And nothing will be shortly left to
continue the memory of the deceased to posterity; pilfery and the opinion some
have, that Tombs, and their Epitaphs, taste somewhat of Popery, having
already most sacrilegiously stolen, erazed, and taken away, almost all the
Inscriptions and Epitaphs, cut, writ, inlaid, or engraven upon the Sepulchers
of the deceased; and most shamefully defaced the glorious rich Tombs, and
goodly monuments of our most worthy Ancestors. It could be wished that some
order might betaken for the preservation of these few which are as yet
remaining: for to mine own knowledge, by the observation I have made in many
Churches, the Monuments of the dead are daily thus abused.

CHAP. V. The reasons wherefore so many have made their own Monuments in their
lifetime. Of the care that all or most of all men have of decent burial. The
burial of the dead, a work acceptable unto God. A funeral Hymn of Aurelius
Prudentius to the like purpose.
IT was usual in ancient times, and so it is in these our days, for persons
of especial rank and quality to make their own Tombs and Monuments in
their lifetime; partly for that they might have a certain house to put their
head in (as the old saying is) whenever they should be taken away by death,
out of this their Tenement, the world; and partly to please themselves, in the
beholding of their dead countenance in marble. But most especially because
thereby they thought to preserve their memories from oblivion.

Absolon in his life time, erected a pillar, to retain the memory of his name,
in that his issue male failed. Will you hear the Text.

2. Sam. c^. ^8
Now Absolon in his lifetime had taken, and reared him up a pillar, which is in
the Kings dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance,
and he called the pillar after his own name, and it is called unto this day,
Absolons place.

This pillar, which Absolon intended for the place of his sepulture, hewne and
framed out of the rock or growing stone, is to be seen at this day, says
Sandys, all entire and of a goodly fabric. But to return, every man like
Absolon desires a perpetuity after death, by these monuments, or by other
means, Cap. 4.
according to that of Tertullian in his book, De Testimonio animae. Quis non
hodie (says he) memoriae post mortem frequentandae ita studet, vt vel
literaturae operibus, vel simplici laud morum, vel ipsorum sepulchrorum
ambitione, nomen suum seruet? These that in their life time do thus build their
own sepulchers, and take care in the ceremonious disposing of their funerals,
would (no question) lay this charge upon those which they must of necessity
trust, in the performance of their Wills and Testaments, and employ their last
days and hours in more heavenly designs; if they did not oftentimes see in
their course of life, that as well heirs as executours, interre both the
honor and memory of the defunct, together with his corpse: perfidiously
forgetting their fidelity to the deceased. Of which will it please you read
this old inscription depicted upon a wall within S. Edmunds Church in
Lumbard-street, London.

has these verses, contra mortuorum Executores, much what to the same effect.
Dicunt Scripture memorare nouissima vite,
Pauper ab hoc mundo transiet omnis homo.
Dat Fortuna status varios, Natura sed omnes
Fine suo claudit, cunctaque morte rapit.
Post mortem pauci qui nunc reputantur amici,
Sunt memores: anime sis memor ipse tue.
Da dum tempus habes, tibi propria sit manus here is;
Auferet hoc nemo quod dabis ipse Deo.
Upon these and the like considerations, they used (as they now do) to
inscribe or engraue these kind of monuments with certain sentences to this
effect. Fallax saepe fides, testataque vota peribunt:
Constitues tumulum, si sapis, ipse tuum.
Or thus. Certa dies nulli, mors certa, incerta sequentum
Cura: locet tumulum qui sapit ipse sibi.
Concluding most commonly with these words.

Viuus fecit. Viuus faciendum curauit. Viuus sibi posuit. Se vino fecit. Viuus
hoc sibi fecit monumentum: and the like.

Some erected their sepulchers whilst they were living, concluding their
inscriptions thus. Sibi and coniugi. Sibi, coniugi and Liberis. Sibi and
posteris. And some that would not have their wives heirs nor any other
entombed therein, thus. Hoc monumentum heredes non sequuntur. Or thus: Rogo per
deos superos inferosque ossa nostra ne violes.

This care of burial moved Augustus Caesar to build his funeral monument, in
the sixth year of his Consulship; for himself, and the succeeding Emperors.

The like reason moved Hadrian to build his Tomb or Sepulcher near unto the
bridge Aelium, for the Mausoleum of Augustus was full; as Xiphilinus writes in
the life of Hadrian.

And to bring you this honey example, the like consideration moved King Henry
the seventh, in the eighteenth year of his reign, to build that glorious
fair Chapel at Westminster, for an house of burial, for himself, his
children, and such only of the bloud-royall, as should descend from his
Ioynes; forbidding that any other of what degree or quality soe^uer, should
ever be interred in that sacred mould; as appears by his last Will and
Testament.

De Ci^t. Dei. ca. 1^.
Saint Augustine says, that the Funerals of the righteous, in the times of old,
were performed with a zealous care, their burials celebrated, and their
Monuments provided in their life time.

R^maines.
Great has been the care of burial (says Camden) ever since the first times,
insomuch that Fathers would lay charges upon their children, concerning the
burial, and translating of their bodies, every one being desirous to return,
in Sepulchra maiorum, into the sepulchers of their Ancestors.

Genesis 49.50.
Jacob at his death charged his son Joseph to carry his body into the
sepulcher of his fathers. And Joseph himself commanded his brethren that they
should remember and tell their pos^eritie, that when they went away into the
land of promise, they should carry his bones thither with them. Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, and Joseph, were buried together in one Sepulcher.

The kings of Egypt accustomed to awe their subjects by threatening to deprive
them of burial. And it was a penalty of the law amongst the Romans. He that
does this, or that, let him be cast forth unburied; and so in the declamations;
He that forsakes his parents in their necessities, let him be cast forth
unburied; An Homicide, let him be cast forth unburied. And so speaks Cicero to
the peoples humor for Milo, when he affirms his carcass to be more wretched,
because it wanted the solemn rites of funeral.

Commanders in wars used to terrify their enemies with the want of burial,
according to this speech of Hector in the fifteenth book of Homers Iliads.
T^ans. by George Chapman*


Then Hector cried out, take no spoil, but rush on to the fleet,
From whose assault (for spoil nor flight) if any man I meet,
He meets his death: nor in the fire of holy funeral,
His brothers nor his sisters hands shall cast within our wall,
His lothed body; but without, the throtes of dogs shall grave
His manlesse limbs.
The people of Israel, crying unto God against the barbarous tyranny of the
Babylonians, who spoiled Gods inheritance, polluted his Temple, destroyed his
religion, and murdered his chosen Nation; amongst other calamities, thus they
complain for the want of sepulture.

The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto fowls of the
heaven; Psalm. 79.
and the flesh of thy Saints unto the beasts of the earth.

Their blood have they shed like waters, round about Jerusalem, and there was
none to bury them.

God commands Elias to tell Iezebel, that, for her wickedness, the dogs should
eat up her flesh in the field of Iesreel; 2. King 9.
and that her carcass should be as doung upon the ground, in the said field of
Iesreel: so that none should say, this is Iezebel.

The seduced Prophet, 1. King 13.
because he disobeyed the mouth of the Lord, was reproved by him who was the
occasion of his error, as he had it in commandment from God; and withal
told, that his carcass should not come unto the sepulcher of his Fathers.

Esaias speaking in derision of the death and sepulture of the king of Babylon,
Chap. 14.18, 19, 20.
which was not with his Fathers, for that his tyranny was so much abhorred;
thus notes his unhappiness.

All the kings of the nations, even they all sleep in glory every one in his
own house.

But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch: like the
raiment of those that are slain, and thrust through with a sword, which go
down to the stones of the pit, as a carcass trodden under feet.

Thou shall not be joined with them in the grave.

Jeremy the Prophet speaking against the breakers of Gods sacred covenants,
brings in (most commonly) the want of burial, as a punishment for such their
heinous offenses as follows.

Thus says the Lord, Ier. 34.20.
I will even give them into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of
them that seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the
fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.

And prophesying against Iehoakim; he is inspired with these words.

Thus says the Lord against Iehoakim, Ier 22.18.19.
the son of Josiah king of Judah: they shall not lament him, saying, Ah my
brother, or ah sister, neither shall they mourn for him, saying, Ah, Lord, or
ah, his glory. He shall be buried, as an ass is buried; (not honorably (says
the Margent) among his fathers) even drawn and cast forth without the gates of
Jerusalem.

In other places of his prophecy, thus.

They shall die of deaths, Ier. 16.4.
and diseases they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried, but
they shall be as doung upon the earth.

They shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, Ier. 14.16.
because of the famine, and the sword, and there shall be none to bury them:
both they and their wives, their sons and their daughters; for I will pour
their wickedness upon them.

Thus says the Lord of hosts, Ier. 19.7.
I will cause them to fall by the sword, before their enemies, and by the hand
of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for
the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the field.

We have diverse examples of this nature in the holy Scriptures. But let us go
no further then to the laws of our own Nation, by which the subject is kept
in awful obedience.

He that commits treason, is adjudged by our Laws, to be hanged, drawn, and
quartered, and his divided limbs to be set upon poles in some eminent place,
within some great Market-towne, or City.

He that commits that crying sin of murder, is usually hanged up in chains,
so to continue until his body be consumed, at or near the place where the
fact was perpetrated.

Such as are found guilty of other criminal causes, as Burglarie, Felony, or
the like, after a little hanging are cut down and indeed buried, but seldom
in Christian mould (as we say) nor in the sepulchers of their fathers, except
their fathers had their graves made near, or under the gallows.

And we use to bury such as lay violent hands upon themselves, in or near to
the high ways, with a stake thrust through their bodies, to terrify all
passengers, by that so infamous and reproachful a burial; not to make such
their final passage out of this present world.

The fear of not having burial, or having of ignominious and dishonorable
burial, has ever affrighted the brauest spirits of the world* this fear made
the dying Mezentius make this request to his enemy Aeneas. Virg. Ae^. l^. 10.


No ill in death: not so came I to sight:
Nor made my Lausus such a match. One right
Afford (if pity stoop t^a vanq^sht foe)
Interre m^ corpse. Much hate of mine I know
Surrounds me. Dead from that feared fury save:
And lay me with my son, both in one grave.
This fear made the faire-helm'd Hector (as Homer calls him) being ready to
combat with Ajax Telamon, to propound this covenant.

Amongst you all whose breast includes the most expulsive mind,
Let him stand forth, as Combatant, by all the rest designed,
Before whom thus I call high Jove, to witness of our strife:
If he with home-thrust-iron can reac^ th'exposure of my life,
(Spoiling my arms) let him at will convey them to his tent.
But let my body be renurn'd, that Troys two-stept descent
May ^^see it in the funeral pile: if I can slaughter him,
(Apollo honoring me so much) I Will spoil his conquered limb:
And bear his arms to Ilion, where in Apollos Shrine
I Will hang them as my Trophies due: his body I Will resign
To ^e disposed by his friends, in flamie Funerals;
And h^nour'd with erected Tomb, where Hellespontus falls
Into Aegaeum, and does reach even to your nauall rode.
That when our beings in the earth shall hide their period,
Epitas^^^um per anticipat^onem.
Suruiuers sailing the black sea, may thus his name renew:
This is his Monument, whose blood long since did fates imbrew,
Whom passing far in fortitude, illustrate Hector slew.
This shall posterity report, and my fame never die.
Cicero, in his second book, De gloria, makes Ajax (glorious in arms) to
entreat Hector, that if it were his fortune, to be vanquished by him so
renowned an enemy; he would afford his body worthy and honorable burial,
and that his Tomb to succeeding ages, might thus speak to all passengers.

Hic situs est vitae iampridem lumina linquens, Aul. Gell. Noc At. li. (...).

Cui quondam Hectoreo perculsus concidit ense,
Fabitur haec aliquis, mea semper gloria vines.
Here he lies deprived of light,
Slain by Hectors sword in fight:
Some one will ever tell this story;
So endless shall be Ajax glory.
Achilles, having given Hector his deaths wound, insulted over him (as it is in
the two and twentieth book of Homers Iliads) thus.

-- And now the dogs and fowls, in ^oulest use
Shall tear thee up, thy corse exposed to all the Greeks abuse.
To whom Hector makes his dying request on this manner.

He fainting said, let me implore, even by thy knees, and soul,
And thy great parents; do not see a cruelty so foul,
Inflicted on me; brass and gold receive at any rate,
And quit my person, that the Peers, and Ladies of our State
May tomb it.
Thus you see how much the most heroical spirits desired the honor of
sepulture, with the performance of all funeral rites; howsoever Lucan in his
fifth book of the Pharsalian wars, makes Julius Caesar (being as then in
danger to be drowned) to expostulate with the Gods, and (in a boasting manner)
to contemn all funeral exequies. Concluding thus. -- O Gods I crave
No Funeral: let the seas utmost wave
Keep my torn carcass, let me want a Tomb
And funeral pile, whilst looked for still to come
Into all Lands I am, and ever feared.
But this was but one of Caesar's rodamantadoes, or thundering declamations in a
storm, only to his poor Bargeman Amyclas, being as then out of all hope or
help for burial, save in the bottom of the sea; otherwise at another time, I
do not doubt but that he would have desired sepulture with all her ceremonies,
as earnestly as Hector or any one of his nine fellow-worthies. For never any
(says Camden) neglected burial but some savage nations; Remains.
as Bactrians, which cast their dead to the dogs; some varlet Philosophers, as
Diogenes, who desired to be devoured of fishes; some dissolute Courtiers; as
Macaenas who was wont to say, Non tumulum curo sepelit natura relictos.
I Am careless of a grave:
Nature her dead will save.
As another said.

De terra interram, and quaeuis terra Sepulchrum.
From earth to earth we go;
Each earths alike grave so.
Lucius Scipio likewise, being overthrown at the battle of Thapsus, where he
was General, fled disguisedly by sea for his own safety, but being driven by
a storm into the Bay of Hippo, where Caesar's Navy lay to guard the shores,
and perceiving them himself and his Bark both lost; he stabbed himself with
his poniard, leapt ouerboard, and drowned himself in the maine; uttering upon
his instant resolution certain words in disdain of burial. Thomas May, lib.
4.
Thus exquisitely delivered in verse by my worthy Friend the continuer of
Lucans Historical poem. My course is run; and, though this armed hand
Shall testify I could have di'd by land,
The Ocean likes me best; within the maine
Unknown for ever Scipio shall remain:
O let my floating carcass never come
To land, lest Affricke should bestow a Tomb,
And to her sons in after ages show
A Monument of vanquished Scipio.
Loath he was that his dead body should either suffer despite, or receive
favor from his enemies; so that I think no otherwise of his imprecations then
I do of Caesar's.

These careless Mecaenas-like resolutions, make so many (I believe) of
especial note amongst us; who either upon a sparing or precise humor, are
content to commit to the earth, their parents, wives, children, and the nearest
unto them, in tenebris, with little better than Sepulchra asinorum.

This office of burying the dead, this last duty done to our deceased friends,
has ever had the prime place of commendation by Lucan, lib. 18. for that he,
so solicitously took care to give all funeral dues, to the head less Trunk
of great Pompey, cut off by the treachery of the vngrat^full base Ptolomey;
upon whom he is made in the said book to bestow this Epitaph.

Here the great Pompey lies, so Fortune pleased,
To instile this stone; whom Caesar's self would have
Interred, before he should have mist a grave.
And Virgil makes burial an honor to such as are slain in battle, and so
consequently of others.

Mean while th'vnburied bodies of our mates
Ciue we to grave, sole honor after fates.
Go honor those brave souls, with their last dues,
Who with their blood purchased this land for us.
Toby his burying of the dead was acceptable unto God, as the Angel
testifies. And the Lord himself, being to arise again the third day,
commended that good work of those religious women, who poured those precious
ointments, with sweet odours, upon his head and body, and did it to bury him.
And the Gospel has crowned them with immortal praise, that took down his
body from the cross, and gave it honest and honorable burial. Lib. 1. de
Ciuit Dei. cap. 11.
Which signifies, says S. Augustine, that the providence of God extends
even unto the very bodies of the dead (for he is pleased with such good deeds)
and do build up the belief of the resurrection. Where, by the way (says he)
we may learn this profitable lesson; how great the reward of alms done unto
the living may be, since this duty and favor shown, but unto the dead, is not
forgotten of God.

Decent burial, according to the quality of the person deceased, with
attendants of kindred and friends, is an honor to the defunct.

Hezekiah (says the text) slept with his fathers, 2. Chro ^2.3^
and they buried him in the highest sepulcher of the sons of David: and all
Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, did him honor at his death.

We commend (many of us I am sure do) that good work of Richard Fox, Bishop
of Winchester, who caused the bones, and other relics of such sacred Princes,
and sainted Prelates, as there had been buried in that Church, and dispersed
abroad in several odd corners, to be placed together in seemly monuments,
upon the top of the new partition built by himself for the same purpose.

And likewise we cannot but love the memory of such, who upon the dissolution,
and final destruction of our religious structures, caused so many funeral
monuments, with the bodies therein included, to be removed into other
neighboring Churches, where by all likelihood, they may rest in peace and
safety, until the last sound of the Trumpet.

In the works of Aurelius Prudentius Clemens (a Spaniard by birth, an ancient
Christian Poet, Pet Opmer. opu^ Chronog ad. An. 408.
and one, Qui palmam inter omnes Christianos Poetas obtinuit; who flourished
about four hundred years after the incarnation of our Lord and Savior) I
find this Funeral Hymn following, of which (and not impertinently) I may
make some use here in this place, translated by Sir John Beaumont Baronet.

O God, Him. 10.
the souls pure fiery spring,
Who different natures would combine:
That man whom thou to life did bring;
By weakness may to death decline.
By thee they both are framed aright,
They by thy hand united be;
And while they join with growing might,
Both flesh and spirit live to thee:
But when division them recalls,
They bend their course to seu'rall ends;
Into dry earth the body falls,
The fervent soul to heaven ascends:
For all created things at length,
By slow corruption growing old,
Must needs forsake compacted strength,
And disagreeing webs unfold.
But thou, dear Lord, have means prepared,
That death in thine may never reign,
And have undoubted ways declared,
How members lost may rise again:
That while those generous rays are bound
In prison under fading things;
That part may still be stronger found,
Which from above directly springs.
If man with baser thoughts possessed,
His will in earthly mud shall drown;
The soul with such a weight oppressed,
Is by the body carried down:
But when she mindful of her birth,
Her self from ugly spots debarres;
She lifts her friendly house from earth,
And bears it with her to the stars.
See how the empty body lies,
Where now no lively soul remains;
Yet when short time with swiftness flies,
The height of senses it regaines*
Those ages shall be soon at hand,
When kindly heat the bones reuiues;
And shall the former house command,
Where living blood it shall infuse.
Dull carcases to dust now worn,
Which long in graves corrupted lay,
Shall to the nimble air be borne,
Where souls before have led the way.
Hence comes it to adorn the grave,
With careful labor men affect:
The limbs dissolved last honor have,
And fun'rall Rites with pomp are decked.
The custom is to spread abroad
White linens, graced with splendor pure,
Sabaean myrrh on bodies strow'd
Preserues them from decay secure.
The hollow stones by caruers wrought*
Which in fair Monuments are laid,
Declare that pledges thither brought,
Are not to death, but sleep conuay'd.
The pious Christians thus ordain,
Believing with a prudent eye
That those shall rise and live again,
Who now in freezing slumbers lie.
He that the dead (dispersed in fields)
In pity hides, with heaps of molds,
To his Almighty Savior yields
A work, which he with joy beholds:
The same Law warnes us all to groan,
Whom one severe condition ties,
And in another death to moan
All fun'rals, as of our allies.
That reverend man in goodness bred,
Who blessed Tobias did beget,
Preferred the burial of the dead
Before his meat, though ready set;
He, while the servants waiting stand,
Forsakes the cups, the dishes leaves,
And digges a grave with speedy hand,
Which with the bones his tears receives.
Rewards from heaven t^is work requite:
No slender price is here repaid,
God cleares the eyes that saw no light,
While fishes gall on them is laid.
Then the Creator would descry
How far from reason they are led
Who sharp and bitter things apply,
To souls on which new light is spread.
He also taught that to no wight,
The heavenly kingdom can be seen,
Till vexed with wounds and darksome night,
He in the worlds rough waves ^ath been*
The curse of death a blessing finds;
Because by this tormenting woe
Steep ways lie plain to spotless minds,
Who to the Stars by s^rrowes go.
The bodies which long perished lay,
Return to live in better years,
That union never shall decay,
Where after death new warmth appears.
The face where now pale color dwells,
Whence foul infection shall arise,
The flowers in splendor then excels,
When blood the skin with beauty dies.
No age by Times imperious law,
With envious prints the forehead dimmes:
No drought, no leanness then can draw
The moisture from the withered limbs.
Diseases which the body eat,
Infected with oppressing pains,
In midst of torments then shall sweat,
Imprisoned in a thousand chains.
The conquering flesh immortal grows,
Beholding from the skies above,
The endless groaning of her foes,
For sorrows which from them did move.
Why are indecent howlings mixed
By living men in such a case?
Why are decre^s so sweetly fixed?
Reprou'd with discontented face?
Let all complaints and murmures fail;
Ye tender mothers stay your tears,
Let none their children dear bewail,
For life renewed in death appears.
So buried seeds, though dry and dead,
Again with smiling greenness spring:
And from the hollow furrows bred,
Attempt new ears of corn to bring.
Earth, take this man with kind embrace,
In thy soft bosom him conceive:
For humane members here I place,
And gen^rous parts in trust I leave.
This house, the soul her guest once felt,
Which from the Makers mouth proceeds:
Here sometime fervent wisdom dwelt;
Which Christ the Prince of wisdom breeds.
A cou'ring for this body make,
The Author never will forget
His works; nor will those looks forsake
In which he has his picture set.
For when the course of time is past,
And all our hopes fulfilled shall be,
Thou opening, must restore at last
The limbs in shape, which now we see.
Nor if long age with powerful reign,
Shall turn the bones to scattered dust;
And only ashes shall retain,
In compass of an handful thrust:
Nor if swift floods, or strong command
Of winds through empty air have tossed
The members with the flying sand;
Yet man is never fully lost.
O God, while mortal bodies are
Recalled by thee, and formed again,
What happy seat will thou prepare,
Where spotless souls may safe remain:
In Abraham's bosom they shall lie
Like Lazarus, whose flowery crown
The rich man does far off epsy,
While him sharp fiery torments drown.
Thy words, O Savior, we respect,
Whose triumph drives black death to loss,
When in thy steps thou would direct
The Thief thy fellow on the Cross.
The faithful see a shining way,
Whose length to Paradise extends,
This can them to those trees convey,
Lost by the Serpents cunning ends.
To Thee I pray, most certain Guide:
O let this soul which thee obay'd,
In her fair birthplace pure abide,
From which she, banished, long has strayed.
While we upon the covered bones
Sweet Violets and leaves will throw:
The title and the cold hard stones,
Shall with our liquid odours flow,
CHAP. VI. Of the care and cost anciently used in the preserving whole and
entire the bodies of the dead. Strange ways, customs, and fashions of burial.
AS in former times the most of all Nations were ardently desirous of decent
burial; so Histories do show that the Ancients, and namely the Egyptians,
were no less careful, and curious to preserve whole and entire, the bodies of
the dead laid within their Sepulchers, and to keep them from putrefaction, so
much as they could possible, which they did by this means. So soon as any one
amongst them (especially of exemplary note) was dead, they would draw out the
brains of the defunct, at the nostrils, with an instrument of iron,
replenishing the same with preservative spices; then cutting up the belly with
an Ethiopian stone, called Laigne, and extracting the bowels, they cleansed
the inside with wine, and stuffing the same with a composition of Cassia,
myrrh, and other odours, closed it again. The like the poorer sort of people
effected with Bitumen (as the inside of their skuls and bellies yet testify,
says Sandvs, lib. 2 who saw such their strange embalmed bodies) fetched from
the lake of Asphaltis in Jury. So did they by the juice of Cedars, which by the
extreme bitterness and si^catiue quality, not only subdued (forthwith) the
cause of interior corruption, but has to this day (a continuance of above
three thousand years) preserved them uncorrupted. Within their bellies
(besides their odorous compositions) they enclosed certain painted papers; and
strange shapes of their Gods, in little models of stone or metal: this done,
they wrapped the body with linen in multitudes of folds, besmeared with gum in
manner of a seare-cloth, swathled with bands of the same; staining their
breasts with Hierogliphycall characters; and so laid them down in such vaults,
as did belong to every man's particular family.

Camerar, Lib. 1. cap. 25.
in his Hist. Meditations, says, That the Ancients fixed nails of brass;
within their dead bodies knowing well that brass is a metal very solid and
lasting, in which quality both Horace and Virgil do commend it: that it
keeps a long time from rust and corruption, and that it is endued with a
particular virtue against putrefaction. And not long since (says he) there was
found in a certain wood near to Nuremburgh very ancient Tombs, and amongst
the bones of the dead, nails and buckles of brass.

It is reported by Fulgosus, and other foreign Authors, as also by our own
contrymen, William of Malmesbury, and Matthew of Westminster; that in the
year of Grace, one thousand thirty and seven, the body of Pallas, the son
of Euander, slain by Turnus in single combat, was found, and taken up in Rome,
entire and sound in all parts, to the great astonishment of the beholders, in
that it had triumphed so many ages over all corruption. At his head was found
The like found at the suppression of Abbaies in (...).
a burning lamp, which could not be extinguished, neither by violence of
blast, nor by aspersion of liquor. Upon whose tomb this Epitaph following was
then found.

Filius Euandri Pallas, quem laurea Turni
Militis occidit; more suo iacet hic.
Pallas Euanders son, by Turnus spear
In combat slain; on this wise lies here.
Within the Parish of Stepney in Midlesex, in Radcliffe field, where they take
ballast for ships; about some fourteen or fifteen years ago, there was
found two Monuments, the one of stone, wherein was the bones of a man, the
other a chest of lead, the upper part being garnished with Scallop shells, and a
crotister border. At the head of the coffin, and the foot, there were two Iars,
of a three foot length, standing, and on the sides a number of bottles of
glistering red earth, some painted, and many great viols of glass, some six,
some eight square; having a whitish liquour within them Within the chest was
the body of a woman, as the Chirurgians judged by the skull. On either side of
her, there was two scepters of Iuory, eighteen inches long, and on her breast
a little figure of Cupid neatly cut in white stone. And amongst the bones two
printed pieces of Iett, with round heads, in form of nails three inches long.

It seems (says Sir Robert Cotton, from whom I had this relation) these
bodies were burned about the year of our Lord 239. being, there were ^ound
diverse coins of Pupienus, Gordian, and the Emperors of that time. And that
one may conjecture by her ornaments, that this last body should be some Princes
or Propretors wife here in Britain, in the time of the Roman government.

In the North isle of the Parish Church of Newport painell in Buckinghamshire,
in the year 1619. was found the body of a man whole and perfect; laid down,
or rather leaning down, North, and South* all the concauous parts of his body,
and the hollownesse of every bone, as well ribs as other, were filled up with
sollid lead. The skull with the lead in it does weigh thirty pounds and six
ounces, which with the neck-bone, and some other bones (in like manner full of
lead) are reserved, and kept in a little chest in the said Church, near to the
place where the corpse were found; there to be shown to strangers as relics
of admiration. The rest of all the parts of his body are taken away by
Gentlemen near dwellers, or such as take delight in rare Antiquities. This I
saw.

Thus you see by the premises, how magnificent our Ancients were in the
ordering and expenses of Funerals; how sumptuous in their houses of death or
sepulchers; and how careful to preserve their dead carcases from putrefaction;
for so much as the soul, says Sandys, knowing it self by divine instinct
immortal, does desire that the body (her beloved companion) might enjoy (as
far forth as may be) the like felicity, giving, by erecting lofty Monuments,
and these dues of Funeral, all possible eternity.

But now judicious Reader understand, that howsoever I have spoken, or
whatsoever I shall speak hereafter of burial, and the ceremonies thereunto
belonging: De (...). Des. cap. 11.
yet I speak now out of Saint Augustine and Ludouicus Vtues his Commentor,
that it is not prejudicial to a Christian soul to be forbidden burial. For
although the Psalmist complains (as I have said before) how that none would
bury the dead bodies of Gods servants; yet this was spoken to intimate their
villainy which did it; rather then their misery which suffered it. For though
that unto the eyes of man, these acts seem bloody and tyrannous, yet precious
in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints. And our faith, holding
fast the promise, is not so frail, as to think that the ravenous beasts can
deprive the body of any part to be wanting in the resurrection; where not a
hair of the head shall be missing; a new restitution of our whole bodies being
promised to all of us in a moment, not only out of the earth alone, but even
out of the most secret angles of all the other elements, wherein any body is or
can be possibly included. A bad death never follows a good life, for there is
nothing that makes death bad, but that estate which follows death. What
power then has the horror of any kind of death, or the want of burial, to
affright their souls that have led a virtuous life? Quo loco, quo modo, quo
tempore, fiat haec emigratio, quid interest? vndique Christi fidelibus ^d
coelestia regna patet aditus.

The family of the gorgeous rich glutton, prepared him a sumptuous funeral
unto the eyes of men, but one far more sumptuous, did the ministering Angels
prepare for the vlcered beggar, in the sight of God. They bare him not into any
Sepulcher of marble, but placed him in the bosom of Abraham.

Lucans Pharsalia, the ninth book, speaking of great Pompey, who wanted a
Tomb, tells us how that his spirit ascended up to the heavens; to which
habitation few come that are entombd in rich and sumptuous monuments, thus. The
eternal Spheres his glorious spirit does hold;
To which come few, with incense buried, tomb'd in gold.
And the said Lucan in his seventh book, speaking of the dead, that Caesar
forbad should be burned, or buried, after he has brought forth many grave
sentences concerning this matter of burial, at length thus concludes, speaking
as it were passionately unto Caesar.

This anger boots thee not; for it is all one
Whether the fire, or putrefaction
Dissolve them; all to Natures bosom go,
And to themselves their ends the bodies owe.
If now these Nations, Caesar, be not burnd,
They shall, when earth and seas to flames are turned;
One fire shall burn the world, and with the sky
Shall mix these bones: where ere thy soul shall be,
Their souls shall go; in air thou shall not fly
Higher, nor better in Auernus lie.
Death frees from fortune: Earth receives again
What ever she brought forth: and they obtain
Heavens couerture, that have no vrnes at all*
Ae^. l. ^^
So Virgil who appoints a place of punishment in hell for the unburied, yet in
Anchises his words, he shows how small the loss of a grave is.

But to conclude with mine Author Saint Augustine. If the necessaries of man's
life, as meat, and clothing, though they be wanting in great extremity, yet
cannot subvert the good man's patience, nor draw him from goodness; how much
less power shall those things have, which are omitted in the burying of the
dead, to afflict the souls that are already at quiet in the secret receptacles
of the righteous. And whereas in the bloody overthrow of many fierce battles;
in the sacking and subversion of many Towns and Cities, the bodies of the
Christians have wanted the rites and ceremonies of burial; it was neither
fault in the living that could not perform them, nor hurt to the dead that
could not feel them. Yet notwithstanding all this which I have spoken, the
bodies of the dead are not to be contemned, and cast away, especially of the
righteous and faithful, which the holy Ghost has used as Organs, and
instruments unto all good works; for if the garment or ring of ones father, be
so much the more esteemed of his posterity, by how much they held him dearer in
their affection; then are not our bodies to be despised, being we wear them
more near unto our selves, then any attire whatsoever.

CHAP. VII. Of Cenotaphs, Honorarie and religious. Of the reverence attributed
to these empty Monuments.
A Cenotaph is an empty Funeral Monument or Tomb, erected for the honor of
the dead, wherein neither the corpse, nor relics of any defunct, are
deposited, in imitation of which our Hearses here in England are set up in
Churches, during the continuance of a year, or for the space of certain
months.

Octauia the sister of Augustus, buried her son, young Marcellus, that should
have been heir in the Empire, with six hundred Cenotaphs or hearses: and
gave to Virgil more then five thousand French crowns, in reward; for the
writing of six and twenty Hexameters in her sons commendation: all which
you may have for nothing, in the latter end of the sixth book of his Aeneidos.

These Cenotaphs were of two sorts: they were made either to the memory of such
as were buried in some other remote funeral monument; or to such which had no
burial at all: The first kind of these Cenotaphs are called by Suetonius in
the life of Claudius, Honorarie tombs; erected Honoris vel memoriae gratia.
Such as the soldiers made to the memory of Drusus, near upon the river of
Rhine, howsoever his body was carried to Rome, and there interred in Campo
Martio.

Alexander Seuerus (slain by the treachery of certain seditious French
soldiers, about the year of grace 238) An Emperor (says Sir Thomas Eliot,
who translated his story out of Greek) whose death all Rome lamented, all good
men bewailed, Some say he was slain here in England, some others in the City
of Mentz in Germany.
all the world repented, whom the Senate deified, noble fame renowned, all wise
men honored, noble writers commended) had his Cenotaph erected in France near
unto the place where he was slain; but his body was carried to Rome, and there
interred under a most rich magnificent sepulcher, as Lampridius affirms.

Septimius Seuerus the Roman Emperor died in York, in the year of man's
salvation 212. out of which City his corpse were carried forth to the funeral
fire, by the sixth Legion of his soldiers, called Victrix; after the military
fashion, Camd. in York.
committed to the flames, and honored with iusts and Turneaments, in a place
near beneath the City Westward, where is to be seen a great mount of earth
raised up as for his Cenotaph. But his ashes, being bestowed in a little golden
pot, or vessel of the Porpherite-stone, were carried to Rome, and shrined
there in the Monument of the Antonines.

Constantine, or Constantius, the younger son to Constantine the Great, who
is supposed to be the builder of Silcester in Hampshire, died at Mopsuestia in
Cilicia, Camd. in Hamp.
and was interred in Constantinople in the Sepulcher of his Ancestors. Yet he
had a Cenotaph, or empty monument, built to his memory, in the said now-ruined
City of Silcester. And many there were that, in honor and remembrance of
them, had such monuments built, about which the soldiers were wont yearly to
just, and keep solemn Turneaments in honor of the dead.

The second kind of Cenotaphs were made Religionis causa, to the memory of
such whose carcases, or dispersed relics, were in no wise to be found, for
example, of such as perished by shipwreck, of such as were slain, cut,
mangled, and hewed apeeces in battle, or of such that died in foreign
nations; whose burials were unknown. For in ancient times it was thought, that
the Ghost of the defunct could not rest in any place quietly, before the body
had decent burial, or the performance thereof, in as ample manner as could
possibly be imagined.

Aeneas (as it is fained) by the help of Sibylla Cumea, descending into hell,
found Palinurus his shipmaster (drowned not long before) among many more
wandering about the lake of Styx, Vir. Aen. l. 6.
because his body was unburied: which kind of punishment is thus related by
the Prophetess; Phaers translation. This prease that here thou see been
people dead, not laid in grave,
A pitious rabble poor that no relief nor comfort have:
This Boate-man Charon is. And those whom now this water bears,
Are bodies put in ground, with worship due of weeping tears.
Nor from these fearful banks, nor rivers hoarce they passage get:
Till under earth in graves their bodies bones at rest are set.
An hundred years they walk, and round about these shores they houe,
And then at last (full glad) to further pooles they do remove.
Then after this she puts him in comfort with hope of Exequies and honorable
burial, thus.

Since when, O Palinure, both all this madness come on thee?
Would thou the Limbo-lake, and doleful floods vntombed see?
Unbidden from this bank do thou indeed to escape intend?
Seek never Gods eternal doom, with speech to think to bend.
Yet take with thee Aeneas word, and comfort thus thy fall,
For they that border next unto that mount, and Cities all,
By t^kens great from heaven shall be compelld thy bones to take,
And tomb they shall thee build, and solemn service shall thee make.
And Palinurus name for evermore the place shall keep.
This spoken, from his heavy heart his cares abating creep,
And sorrows partly shranke; and glad on earth his name he knew.
Ulysses at the commandment of Circes went down into the lower shades, where
he met with his companion, or fellow-traueller Elpenor, who desired of him
burial, H^^. ^^yss. ^. ij.
with the ceremonies thereof; as also a Sepulcher, which Ulysses granted and
erected to his memory a Cenotaph.

Do not depart from hence, and leave me thus
Vnmournd, unburied; lest neglected I
Bring on thy self th*incensed Deity.
I know, that sai^d from hence, thy ship must touch
On th'Isle Aeaea, where vouchsafe thus much,
(Good King) that landed, thou will instantly,
Bestow on me thy royal memory.
And on the foamie shore a Sepulcher
Erect to me, that after times may hear
Of one so hapless. Let me these implore;
And fix upon my Sepulcher the Ore,
With which alive I shook the aged Seas,
And had of friends the dear societies.
To these inania busta, or vacua Sepulchra, the friends of the defunct would
yearly repair, and there offer sacrifice, upon Altars erected near to the
Cenotaph for that purpose, calling upon the spirit, ghost, or Manes of him, to
whose memory the Cenotaph was made, by which ceremony they imagined, that the
body of the party deceased, would lie some where or other at re^^, and his
ghost would give over walking, as though all the dues of funeral had been
really performed to him at his death: Parental. in praef.
as in Ausonius. Voce ciere animas, funeris instar habet.
And aga^ne.

Ille etiam moesti cui defuit vrna sepulchri,
Nomine ter dicto paene sepultus erit.
Aeneas saluted the soul of Deiphobus, the son of old Priam, at his Cenotaph
after the same manner.

-- The rumor went, Virgil. l. 6. Aen.

How in the night extreme of Greekish slaughters weary spent;
Thou headlong threw'st thy self on mixed heap of enemies slain:
Then I my self to thee, an empty Tomb on Rheta plain
Advancing up did build, and thrice thy soul saluted clear;
Thy name, and arms that place preserues, but thee O friend so dear,
Could I not see, that in thy countrey-ground I might interre.
Then Deiphobus said, Nothing sweet friend can I require;
All duties done thou have, nor more my ghost can thee desire.
You have the manner of sacrificing about these Cenotaphs expressed in Virgil,
lib. 3. Aen. where Andromache celebrates the Anniuersary of her slain husband
arme-puissant Hector, thus. Great sacrifice by chance that time, and gifts with
heavy mind
Before the Town in greenwood shade, by Simois water side,
Andromache to Hectors dust with service did provide;
And dainties great of meat she brought, and on his soul she cride
At Hectors Tomb; that green with grass, and turfs stood her beside.
And causes more to mourn, thereby two Altars had she set.
The solemnity of Polydores obit at his empty hearse; is described in the
said book much what after the same manner: Anon therefore to Polydore an
Hearse we began prepare,
And huge in height his Tomb we rear; all Altars hanged are,
With weeds of mourning hewes, and cypres trees, and black devise:
And Trojan wives with hair disclosde, as is their guise.
Great fomy boules of milk we threw lukewarm on him to fall,
And holy blood in basins brought we pour, and last of all
We shrikt, and on his soul our last, with great outcries we call.


And much what to the same purpose are these verses in Ouids Metam. lib. 6.
fab. 7.

Progne, her royal ornaments reiects,
And puts on black: an empty Tomb erects
To her imagined ghost: oblations burns:
Her sisters fate, not as she should, she mournes.
To the memory of the Grecians slain in the wars of Troy, Pausa. in
Corinthiacis.
a Cenotaph was set up at Corinth.

In the expedition of Cyrus, Xenophon lib. 6.
an empty sepulcher was built for the slain and mangled soldiers, whose
relics could not be found.

The Romans, Tacit. li, Annal. cap. 23.
six years after the slaughter made by Arminius of so many of their Legions;
erected a Cenotaph, or covered with earth the remains of their friends and
kindred, howsoever it was uncertain whether they buried the stranger or
friend. And Caesar to show a grateful memory of the dead, and himself to be
partaker of their grief, with his own hands put the first turfe on their
Tombs.

The Primitive Christians did exhibit a religious honor to the Cenotaphs of
holy men (to whose memory many in those days were erected) which for the
profession of the Gospel had suffered martyrdom, or undergone those variety
of torments, which were as then inflicted upon the faithful: as you may read
in Theodoret. lib. de Martyr. and in these Saphicks of Aurelius Prudentius.

Per^ Stephanon. Hy^nus 4.
Nonne, Vincenti, peregre necatus
Martyr, his terris tenui notasti
Sanguinis rore speciem futuri
morte propinqua?
Hoc colunt ciues velut ipsa membra
Cespes includat suus, and paterno
Seruet amplectens tumulo beati
Martyris ossa.
It was, and is the use in most countries, to inscribe these empty monuments,
as real sepulchers, with the names and titles of the defunct, to whose honor
they were intended. As in Ovid. Meta, lib. 11. fab. 10.

Seas fright me with their tragical aspect,
Of late I saw them on the shore eiect
Their scattered wracks, and often I have read
Sad names on Sepulchers that want their dead.
And a little after in the same fable, where Alcyone mournes for her drowned
husband Ceix, thus.

-- would I with thee
Had put to sea: a happy fate for me;
Then both together all the time assignd
For life had lived; nor in our death disioynd
Now here, I perished there: on that profound,
Poor I was wrackt; yet thou without me drowned.
O I, then floods more cruel, should I strive
To lengthen life, and such a grief survive;
Nor will I, nor forsake thee, nor defer.
Though one vrne hold not both, one Sepulcher
Shall join our titles: though thy bones from mine
The seas disseuer, yet our names shall join.
Death choakt the rest. --
Our Ancients accustomed likewise to garnish, deck, and adorn these
cenotaphs, as other tombs or sepulchers; and that with all kind of reverence:
and whosoever did deface, or break down, any of these Honorarie void
Monuments, exemplarie punishment was inflicted upon the party so offending, as
upon your Tumboruchoi or graue-diggers. But I will conclude this chapter with
this difference of Sepulchers and Cenotaphs; as I find it recorded by Scipio
Gentilis, Sepulchrorum sanctitas, says he, in ipso solo est, quod nulla vi
moueri neque deleri potest. Cenotaphiorum vero in ipsa religione and reuerentia
viuorum, quae and mutari and deleri potest.

CHAP. VIII. Of the sanctity ascribed sometimes to ancient Funeral monuments;
and of the ardent desire most men have, and ever had, to visit the Tombs and
Sepulchers of eminent worthy persons.
Funeral Monuments (especially of the godly and religious) have ever been
accounted sacred.

Batti veteris sacrum Sepulchrum.
The sacred Sepulcher
Of old Bat, lo is here. says Catullus.
To which effect, Quintilian, Declam. 10. Sacratos morte lapides, etiam ossa
and cineres, and ossa religiose quiescentia fracta sparsisset vrna. And they
were accounted the more sacred, by how much they were of more continuance.
Sepulchra sanctiora sunt vetustate, says Vlpian. And as in the Se^pulchres
themselves, there was ever holden to be a kind of sancti^ie; so there was
holden to be the like or more holiness in the soil whereupon these
sepulchers were made and erected. And such a holiness, as I have said before,
quod nulla vi moueri neque deleri potest; and more especially in that ground,
wherein the bodies of Christians were interred, by reason of the sanctified
corpse that it received.

It is an use in some parts of Ireland (as yet not altogether abolished) for
children to swear by their forefathers hand, or by their Lords hand. And in
the country where I was borne, the vulgar sort especially, do most commonly
swear by the cross of their own Parish Kirk, as they call it, and in
ancient times children used to swear, by the Sepulchers of their parents.
Others by the sepulchers of such persons, who in their life time were reputed
honorable amongst them, either in regard of the worthiness of their person,
or of the eminence of place of government which they held in the weal public.
And by these oaths (the things themselves being reverently esteemed, and
accounted sacred) their assertions or asseuerations were always holden the
better to be believed. I read in the Sto^ehouse of Times, lib. 8. cap. 12.
Part. 1. that a Master bearing his Slave near to the Temple of Apollo; the
Slave fled from him, and knowing that the Temple afforded refuge, ran
thereinto, and mounting up to the Altar embraced the image His Lord pursued
him, and having forcibly recovered him from the Statue without any reverence of
the place, began again to give him many Bastonadoes. The servant fled from him
once more, and ran to save himself at the Tomb of his Lords deceased
Father: but then, in mere paternall duty, he left punishing him any more, and
pardoned him the fault which he had committed. In such reverend and religious
regard the very Pagans had the Tombs of their Ancestors.

But, with us, in these days, I see no such reverence that sons have to
their fathers hands, or to their Sepulchers. I hear no swearing by Kirkes,
Crosses, or Sepulchers. I hear sometimes, I must confess, for swearing to
build Churches; swearing to pull down crosses, and to deface or quite demolish
all Funeral Monuments; swearing and protesting that all these are remains of
Antichrist, papisticall and damnable.

Now to come to the other part of this Chapter. All men in general are taken
with an earnest desire to see ancient great Cities; yea and the very tract
where such cities were in former times situated, howsoever they be destroyed,
laid level with the ground, and their very ruins altogether ruined: I will
instance with the glory of Asia, Troy Ovid. Met. l. 15.
So rich, so powerful, that so proudly stood,
That could for ten years space spare so much blood,
Now prostrate, only her old ruins shows,
And Tombs that famous Ancestors enclose.
Now although these ruins, and ruined Tombs, are at this day no more but
coniecturally extant: as Sandys writes, who viewed the circuit of ground
whereupon it once stood. And that Iam seges est vbi Troia fuit.
Corn now grows where Troy once stood.
Yet like him we daily know many Travelers sailing near thereunto, to be
desirous to see those celebrated fields, that affoorded to rarest wits so
plentiful an argument.

And so we read how that in former times, many took the like pains to behold
this City so renowned throughout the whole Universe. For example, the great
Alexander. Earths fatal mischief, and a cloud of thunder
Rending the world, a starr that struck asunder
The Nations.
as Lucan calls him: having read many heroical actions performed at the
besieging of this City, made it in his Iourny to see it; and finding it laid
desert, caused it to be reedified; gave great immunities and privileges to the
inhabitants, whom he exempted from ordinary Tributes, and instituted their
Free-martes, or Markets, for all such as would dwell there, or negotiate with
them.

Ovid. l. 25.
That blasing Comet, Julius Caesar, who darted his rays over so many regions.

And stretched his Empire over sea and land.
goes in person to behold that farre-famed City; where treading upon Hectors
graue-stone, hid with rubish, and grown over with grass, he is found fault
withal by a Phrygian, thus.

Respect you not great Hectors Tomb, quoth he, but for all this reprehension
Lucn. l. 9.
Sacked Troyes yet honored name he goes about,
To find the old wall of great Apollo out.
Now fruitless trees, old oaks with putrifi'd
And rotten roots the Trojan houses hide,
And Temples of their Gods, all Troy's orespread
With bushes thick, her ruins ruined
He sees the bridal grove, etc.
And being pleased with the sight of these Antiquities, he offers sacrifice to
the ghost of Hector, and to the rest of those magesticke Heroes, or halfe-gods,
there interred: promising withal (conditionally) to build up anew this City of
Troy.

Then Caesar pleased with sight of these so praised
Antiquities, a green turffe altar raised,
And by the Frankincense-fed fire prepared
These orizons not vain; you Gods that guard
These Heroes dust, and in Troyes ruins reign:
Aeneas household gods, that still maintain
In Alba and Lauinia your shrines,
Upon whose altars fire yet Trojan shines;
Thou sacred Temple closed Palladium,
That in the sight of man did never come;
The greatest heir of all Iulus race,
Here in your former seat implores your grace,
And pious uses on your altars lays;
Prosper my course, and thankful Rome shall raise
Troyes walls again; your people I Will restore,
And build a Roman Troy.
Marcus Aurelius, Dioclesian, and Claudius, Roman Emperors, potent, and
mighty, took pains to travel from Rome to this City of Troy, only to take
suruay of what venerable antiquities were as then remaining; and to leave
memory to posterity of their being there, they caused a goodly column of white
marble to be therein erected, whereupon were engraven these words following.

Imperator. Caesar. Mar. Aur. Pius. Foelix. Parthicus Maximus, Trib. Pleb. Imp.
P.X.V. Cons. III. Prouinciam Asiam, per viam, and flumina pontibus subiugauit.

And on the other side of the said pillar was likewise engraven,

Imperator Caesar Augustus Dioclesiano. P. Cos. 11. regnante Tribunicia vicit
potestate. M.F.T. and Claudius, C. VIII. P.R.

But to come nearer home; who has ever read or credibly heard of the
magnificencie of that capacious City of Verulam (of which I have spoken before)
so much renowned for so many memorable exploits, but more especially for the
invincible constancy, and resolute suffering, of our Protomartyr, Saint Alban,
that would not desire to see the place where it sometimes stood? howsoever Of
it there now remains no memory, Spons. Ruins of Time.

Nor any little monument to see,
By which the Traveler, that fares that way,
This once was she, may warned be to say.


Who would not see, if he could with conueniencie, the situation of Silcester
in Hampshire, having read in our ancient Historiographers, how famous it was in
the time of Constantius the son of great Constantine, and how that our first
Christian worthy, king Arthur, was there invested with the royal Diadem?
howsoever, no marks are at this day remaining to show that ever it was a
City; save a wall of two miles in compass, containing within fourscore Acres
of ground, divided into certain cornfields.

The seeing of places, we know to have been frequented or inhabited by men,
whose memory is esteemed, or mentioned in stories, does move and stir us up
as much, or more, then the hearing of their noble deeds, or reading of their
compositions*

With the like desire (or more then they have to see these old Cities entombed
in their own ruins) many men take pains with far travel, to view strange
cities, famous and flourishing in their own country, or in foreign Nations.

What stranger, or homebred countryman, would not ardently long to see our
rich, powerful, and imperial City of London; when he reads or hears how
spacious, how populous, how plenteous, and how fair builded it is? And who
would not covet to see Paris, hearing that it is the capital City of France;
and as some will have it, of all Europe, far greater fairer built, and better
situate then London.

And who would not visit Rome, if abilities of body and means were
all-sufficient, his occasions would permit, and that with safety he might; it
being a city, Laudandis pretiosior ruinis: Even made more honorable
By ruins memorable.
Moun. (...) Cap. ^.
As Mountaigne writes, and as I my self, being there, did also observe; A City
whose ruin is glorious with renown, and swollen with glory; for low-leuelled
as she lies, and even in the Tomb of her glory, yet for all this she
reserueth the lively image and regardfull marks of Empire. And, above the
rest, who would not ardently desire to see Jerusalem that holy City with the
sepulcher, having heard or read the sacred Scriptures; or such historical
Authors as have written of the same?

Considering then that the most of men do earnestly desire, Ulysses like Qui
mores hominum multorum vidit, and vrbes.
to see ancient great cities (observing ever their government, with the manners
of the Inhabitants) either flourishing, quite fallen down, or partly ruined;
So all men (a snifling conuenticle or company of proud Sectaries excepted) are
as greedily affected to view the sacred Sepulchers of worthy, famous
personages, yea and the very places, where such have been interred, although
no Funeral Monument at all be there remaining, to continue their memories:

This desire made Alexander the great, in his Asian expedition, go to visit the
Tomb of Achilles, which he covered with flowers, and ran naked about it (as
then the custom was in funerals) sacrificing to the ghost of his kinsman,
whom he reputed most happy, that had such a Trumpet as Homer to resound his
virtues; and weeping over the Tomb, complained that he was not so fortunate,
as to have a man that could so well publish his praises, as Homer had done
those of Achilles.

The sight of all the far-fam'd Antiquities of Egypt did not so much de^^ght
Caesar, as the sight of the Tomb of Alexander. Caesar in Egypt fearelesse
walks and sees Lucan in the Argument.

Their Temples, Tombs, and famed Antiquity*

confidence.
-- then goes he^
The stately Temple of the old God to see;
Which speaks the ancient Macedonian greatness
But there delighted with no objects sweetness,
Not with their gold, nor Gods maiesticke dress
Nor lofty City walls; with greediness
Into the burying vault goes Caesar down*
There Macedonian Philips mad-braind son
The prosperous Thief, lies buried* whom just (...)
Slew in the worlds revenge
Augustus his successor, Emperor of Rome, went with the like desire, or more,
to see the said Tomb of Alexander; And not contented with the bare sight of
the Sepulcher, ^
Corpus Alexandri inspexit, idque attrectauit ita vt nasi quoque (ita enim
fertur) particulam aliquam fregerit: he would needs look into the Tomb and
behold the body of the worlds terror, Alexander, which he so feelingly
handled, that he broke a little part of Alexanders Nose: as it is reported.

But to come to our selves; What concourse of people come daily, to view the
lively Statues and stately Monuments in Westminster Abbey wherein the sacred
ashes of so many of the Lords anointed, beside other great Potentates are
entombed. A sight which brings delight and admiration, and strikes a religious
apprehension into the minds of the beholders.

We desire likewise to behold the mournful ruins of other religions houses,
although their goodly fair structures be altogether destroyed, their tombs
battered down, and the bodies of their dead cast out of their coffins; for
that, that very earth which did sometimes cover the corpse of the defunct, puts
us in mind of our mortality, and consequently brings us to unfeigned
repentance. What numbers of Citizens and others at this very time, go to Lesnes
Abbey in Kent, to see some few coffins there lately found in her ruins,
wherein are the remains of such as have been there anciently interred; of
which, when I come to speak of her Foundation.

Neither can we pass by, but with yearning hearts look upon that fatned soil
(the fertile seed-plot of the Church) which in former times has been
sprinkled with the blood, blackt with the cinders, and strawne with the ashes,
of those blessed Saints, who for the profession of the Gospel, by sword, fire,
and faggot, have suffered most cruel martyrdom: giving reverence and honor to
their memories, because by their sufferings true Religion was propagated, and
all idolatry demolished: which we may lawfully do, as unto Gods chief
champions standing unto death for the truth. And as unto men whom God has
advanced into the society of his Angels in heaven; giving also thanks, at these
Martyrs and Saints solemn feasts, to God for their victories, endeavoring the
attainment of such crowns and glories as they have already attained; with
other religious performances due unto them* as ornaments of their memories.
Provided always that we do not intermi^e out devotions with superstitious
adoration.

CHAP. IX. Of the punishments both by humane Jaws, and Gods severe justice,
^^flicted upon such malefactors in foregoing ages, who violated Sepulchers* Of
Church-robbers.
THose ^in foregoing ages) which did violate, misuse, or distaine tombs,
graves, sepulchers, or any of these funeral Monuments, were punished richer
with death, perpetual exile, condemnation to the mines, banishment for a time,
payment of money, forfeiture of goods, loss of members, or the like according
to the quality of the person, and circumstance of the fact. To begin with the
Clergy*

^ Priest found guilty of this execrable act (being so much more odious, by
how much his place was reputed more honorable and religious) was degraded from
his Priesthood, his goods set to open sale, and forfeited, and himself
condemned to perpetual banishment.

If a man of eminent place, of great riches, rank, and quality, did with an
aimed hand, despoile any Tomb or Sepulcher, Latronis more, after the manner of
an highway robber, that man by the Law was put to execution; if vnaimed, then
the Judge did send him to the Mines, or to banishment, or punish him with some
pecuniarie mu^ct, to the value, most commonly, of half his goods, and branded
him with eternal infamy.

If a Servant, or a man of mean fortunes, was known to pull down, or deface
any funeral Monument, without his masters priuitie, he was condemned to the
Mines; if he had been urged thereunto by his master, then he was adjudged for
a time to be banished; if he did dig up, and draw out of the grave, the body
or bones of the defunct, then his judgment was death.

If any man did deface, or cut away any part of the Effigies or representation
of the defunct, carved, engraven, or embost, upon any graue-stone, tomb, or
sepulcher, that man by the law was to lose his hand.

Whosoever in the repairing of any ruinous decayed Sepulcher, did any way
indecently touch the body of the dead person, therein laid down to his
eternal rest* that party so offending, was commanded by the Law, De^em pondo
auri Fisco infer, to bring ten pound weight of gold into the ^xchequer:

But the most execrable and hellish abuse of all other offered to the dead, is
effected by witchcraft, incantation, and Art-magicke; an art, says
Quin^^l^a^s, Declam. 15. which is said to disquiet the Gods, to trouble and
displace the stars, to search into the graves and sepulchers of the dead, to
mutilate, dismember, and cut off, certain parts of the carcases therein
inhumed, and by those pairings and cuttings, together with certain horrid
enchantments, charms, and spells, to bring to pass strange, diabolical
conclusions. The powerful force of which coniurers, witches, or infernal Hags
is thus expressed by the ancient Poets. Skilled in black Arts, (...) 8

And he auen^as thundered, Jove not knowing why.
But not to speak thus in general of their power, and come nearer to the
purpose: Sextus the son of great Pompey, desirous to know the event of the
Pharsalian wars, consults thereof with the witch Erictho, who, amongst many
her powerful charms, resolves to take up the body of one lately buried, which
she, by her Art-magicke, would conjure to disclose the sad issue of his and his
fathers fates: as it is thus in the Argument of the said sixth book. To the
dire witch Erictho, Sextus goes.
This fatal wars sad issue to disclose:
She quickens a dead carcass, which relates
To Sextus ear, his and his Fathers Fates,
And craving then deaths freedom to obtain,
Is by a magic spell dissolved again.
Now, in the book following, Lucan makes young Sextus thus to woe, and
solicit the old witch Erictho, for the speedy knowledge of the wars event.
-- thus Pompey's fearful son best a^e
Wisest of all Thessalians, that can make

To search what end of this great war shall be.
The witch makes a replication, with an expression, as also a limitation, of
her magic power, in these words. The ^mpious witch proud of a fame so spread

possessed his inward parts with some diabolical spirit, who by and through
(...)gans might give to her and young Sextus some satisfactory answers, (...)
she goes forward with her demands.

Shall thou rewarded be: if truth thou tell,
(...) our Hamonian art I Will set thee free
Throughout all ages, and bestow on thee
Such funerals, with charms so burn thy bones,
Thy ghost shall hear no incantations.
Let this the fruit of thy reuiuall be,
No spells, no herbs shall dare to take from thee
Thy long safe rest, when I have made thee die,
The Gods, and Prophets answer doubtfully;
But he, that dares enquire of ghosts beneath,
And boldly go to th'oracles of death,
Is plainly told the truth; spare not, but name
Plainly the things, and places all, and frame
A speech, wherein I may confer with fate*
Adding a charm to make him know the state
Of whatsoever she asked; thus presently
The weeping carcass spoke.
The devil in his conference with the Sompner (who to tell you by the way, --
Is a renner up and down The de^^^^^ion of a Sompner, Chaucer in the ^riei^
Prologue.

With maundements, fornicatioun
And is y beat at every tounes end)
Amongst other his subtilties relates this for one; by way of interrogation,
thus. Yet tell me (quoth this Sompner) faithfully, Chaucer in the Friars tale.

Make ye you new bodies thus always
Of elements? the fiend answered nay:
Sometime we feign, and sometime we arise
With dead bodies, and that in sundry wise,
And speak as renably, fair and well
As the Phitonesse did to Samuel.
This violation or fearful disturbance of the dead, was punished with extreme
tortures, and afterward by decollation.

Kelley (otherwise called Talbot) that famous English Alchymist of our times,
who flying out of his own country (after he had lost both his cares at
Lancaster) was entertained with Rodolph the second, and last of that Christian
name, Emperor of Germany: for whom Elizabeth of famous memory, sent (very
secretly) Captain Peter Gwinne, with some others, to persuade him to return
back to his own native home; which he was willing to do: and thinking to
escape away in the night, by stealth, as he was clammering over a wall in his
own house in Prague (which bears his name to this day, and which sometime was
an old Sanctuary) he fell down from the battlements, broke his legs, and
bruised his body; of which hurts within a while after he departed this world.

Sed quorsum haec, you will say: then thus, This diabolical questioning of the
dead, for the knowledge of future accidents, was put in practice by the
foresaid Kelley; who, upon a certain night, in the Park of Walton in le dale,
in the county of Lancaster, with one Paul Waring (his fellow companion in such
deeds of darkness) inuocated some one of the infernal regiment, to know
certain passages in the life, as also what might be known by the devils
foresight, of the manner and time of the death of a noble young Gentleman, as
then in his wardship. The black ceremonies of that night being ended, Kelley
demanded of one of the Gentleman's servants, what corse was the last buried in
Law-church-yard, a Church thereunto adjoining, who told him of a poor man that
was buried there but the same day. He and the said Waring entreated this
foresaid servant, to go with them to the grave of the man so lately interred,
which he did; and withal did help them to dig up the carcass of the poor
caitiffe, whom by their incantations, they made him (or rather some evil
spirit through his Organs) to speak, who delivered strange predictions
concerning the said Gentleman. I was told thus much by the said Seruingman, a
secondarie actor in that dismal abhorrid business: and diverse gentlemen, and
others, are now living in Lancashire to whom he has related this story. And
the Gentleman himself (whose memory I am bound to honor) told me a little
before his death, of this coniuration by Kelley; as he had it by relation from
his said Servant and Tenant; only some circumstances excepted, which he
thought not fitting to come to his masters knowledge.

These injuries done against the dead, who ought to sleep in peace until the
last sound of the Trumpet, have ever been, even amongst the very Pagans
themselves, esteemed execrable. Insomuch that if any man that was known to
have committed such an heinous offense, and did by chance escape the hand of
humane Justice, yet he could not (in their opinion) avoid the punishment of the
divine powers. Whereupon they used to make their imprecations to Isis, or some
other of their gods or goddesses; against such as should any ways violate and
break down their Sepulchers or eternal houses of rest. As in this old
Inscription.

Secus qui fecerit; mitem Isidem iratam sentiat, and suorum Ossa eruta, atque
dispersa videat. We read in holy Writ that the king of the Moabites was so
sauagely cruel, even after death, against the king of Edom; that he took his
body out of the Sepulcher, and burnt his bones into lime; for which barbarous
rage, upon the sacred remains of a kings body, he and his people were
punished of God: these are the words of the Prophet.

Amos^^
Thus says the Lord, for three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will
not turn to it, because it burnt the bones of the king of Edom into lime.

Therefore will I send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of
Kerioth, and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of a
Trumpet.

And I will cut off the Judges out of the midst thereof, and will slay all the
Princes thereof with him, says the Lord.

Amongst the Christians, adeo flagitiosum hoc scelus habitum fuit, vt atiam
inter causas relatum sit, sur vxor a marito diuortere posset, si nimirum
Sepulchrorum dissolutorem esse probauerit: says Kirkman, De funeribus Romans l.
3. cap. 26. out of Theodosius and Valent. Emperors, Cod. de repudijs.

Remains.
And of this barbarous kind of cruelty against the dead, Camden in his Remains
gives you these words following, out of Nouel. Leg. Valent. Aug. de Sepulchris,
Tit. V. Nimis barbara est, and vesana crudelitas, munus extremum luce
carentibus inuidere, and dirutis per inexpiabile crimen Sepulchris, monstrare
coelo eorum reliquias humatorum. And the heathens (says he) did account and
verily believe, that those qui in patrios cineres minxissent; hoc est, qui
patrium Monumenta violassent: which had pist upon their fathers ashes, that is
to say, those which had violated the Monuments of their Ancestors, elders, or
forefathers, to be no otherwise then Patricides or murderers of their fathers
or dear friends; and that such should be struck to death by lightning from
heaven; and after death that they should be frightened, tossed up and down, and
tormented in hell, with burning torches by the hands of the furies; whereupon
Horace de Art Poetica versus finem.

Nec satis apparet cur versus factitet, vtrum
Minxerit in patrios cineres; an triste bidental
Mouerit incestus.
In Cimbrike Chersonese; a Distich, upon one of the funeral Monuments of the
family of the Ranzouies, gives this admonishment to the wayfaring man.

Ad Viatorem.
Si pia maiorum violas monumenta, viator;
Vltrices Furias experiere breui.
As it was holden unlawful and punishable, in former times, for any one to
piss, in or against the walls of any religious structure (a custom (to our
shame) too commonly used of us in these days, of which I shall have often
occasion to speak hereafter) so, you may think, that it was holden to be an
impious and heinous offense for any one, to pollute with urine, the tombs, or
graves of their parents, predecessors, friends, or any other whosoever. Which
to prevent, they were wont to make a deprecation, or earnest suit, in some part
of their funeral Inscriptions, on this manner. Hospes ad hunc tumulum ne meias,
Ossa precantur tecta hominis.
For indeed such as had their graves, tombs, statues, or representations, thus
stained and defiled, were thought to have passed out of this world with shame
and ignominy.

I cannot without grief remember (says Camden) how barbarously and
unchristian like some not long since have offended by the abusing of these
Monuments; Remains.
yea some mingendo in patrios cineres; which yet we have seen strangely
revenged.

Now as the violation of Sepulchers, so the depredation of Churches,
Church-robbing, or Sacrilege, was in all ages accounted most damnable. De
Ecclesia qui aliquid furatur, Aug. super Ioha.
Iudae proditori comparatur: He that steals any thing from the Church, may be
compared to Judas the traitor. Aliquid inde subtrahere, Hieron. Ep. 34.
omnium praedonum cupiditatem superat; to hook or draw any thing from thence,
is a sin, which exceeds the most detestable desire of all other sorts of
robbers.

Sacrum sacro(...) qui dempserit, Cicero de Legibus.
rapueritque Parricida esto: He that abates, or forcibly takes ^way that which
is sacred, or given to any sacred use, let him be reputed, and thought of, as
we do of a murderer of his own parents.

Against Church-spoilers, and breakers of Church-liberties, Ann. 1257. 3. Maij,
Boniface Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted with other Bishops, apparelled in
their Pontificals, with Tapers burning, denounced the sen^tence of
Excommunication, in this form.

Rastat. (...) Excommengement.
By the authority of Almighty God, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost,
and of the glorious mother of God, and perpetual Virgin Mary, of the blessed
Apostles, Peter and Paul, and of all Apostles, and of all Martyrs, of blessed
Edward king of England, and of all the Saints of heaven; we excommunicate,
accurse, and from the benefits of our holy mother the Church, we sequester all
those, that hereafter willingly, and maliciously, deprave or spoil the Church
of her right. And all those that by any cra^t, or wiliness, do violate,
break, diminish, or change the Church liberties and free customs, contained
in the Charters of the common liberties, etc.

But I speak here of such sacrilegious persons as do rob, and bereave the
Church of her treasure and sacred ornaments; a sin of such, only, which do
misprise, and contemn Religion: a sin which has been by the very Pagans
observed never to escape unpunished.

^
Cum oppidum Tolosanum in terra Gallia Quintus Cepio Consul diripu^sset;
multumque auri in eius oppidi templis furisset, quisquis ex ea direptione aurum
attigit, misero cruciabilique exitu perijt.

Quintus Cepio with his company having taken and spoiled the Town or City of
Toulouse in France, entered forcibly into the holy Temples, out of which
sacrilegiously he took to the quantity of one hundred and ten thousand
marks in gold, and five hundred millions of marks in silver; but every man of
them, which were guilty of that robbery, with all their kindred and families
died within that year; and not above one of them, did carry so much as one
piece thereof home to his own house. This treasure of Toulouse was a part of
the Delphian riches. For Brennus (the brother of Belinus king of great
Britain) Captain of the Gauls brake open the Temple of Apollo at Delphos,
for the riches and the gold therein, which had been offered to the Gods, which
he committed to public spoil. The most part whereof was conuaid by the
Tectosages (a people of the West part of Narbon) to this city of Toulouse;
Justin. Hist. l. 32.

the most of his army (which consisted of one hundred and fifty thousand
footmen, and fifteen thousand horsemen) were discomfited and slain; and he
so furiously possessed, that he slew himself with his own hands. ^
-- quis enim laesos impune putaret

For who could think the Gods thus wronged
Their punishment would be prolonged.
Virgil makes these Church-robbers, these contemners of Religion, to be more
miserably, then others, tormented in hell.

-- Phlegyas miserrimus omnes

Discite iustitiam moniti, and non temnere Diuos.
-- Phlegyas most of misers all,
Amongst those caytiues dark and loud with voice to them does rore,
Learn Justice now by this, and Gods above despise no more.
This Phlegyas king of the Lapithes (a people dwelling in a part of Thessalie)
having done infinite damages in Greece, surprising many Towns and Cities:
became in the end so over* weening, and foolish bold, that he sacked the
foresaid Temple of Apollo in Delphos, and slew Philamon, that cunning Harper,
the son of Apollo, who brought an armed power to rescue his fathers oracle.
Upon which sacrilege and contempt of the gods, all the country of the
Phlegyans was utterly ruinated with an earthquake, and flaming arrows shot
from heaven, which killed most of the people, and the few that remained died of
the plague; and for this high handed offense, their foresaid king is still
plagued in hell. Which verses of Virgil, to that purpose, thus paraphrastically
translated, will it please you to read over again: Phlegias king most
wretched in that place;
Forewarneth all of his great misery,
And as sad witness of his pitious case,
In those dim shades he cries out woefully:
Learn to do Justice: and by my contempt,
Of the high Gods, do you like fate prevent.
Histories affoard infinite examples of this kind in all sorts of Religions*
yea Christian kings, and other Potentates in all ages have misprised the true,
only, all-sauing God, by the sacrilegious taking away of the rights, riches,
and ornaments of holy Church; yet it has been observed, that they seldom or
never escaped scotfree as: the sequel of this work will show.

Severe punishments have formerly been inflicted upon Church* robbers of the
meaner rank, Stow. Annal.
by the strictness of our Laws here in England. For an instance, in the
twentieth year of Edward the fourth, on the 22. day of February, five notable
malefactors were put to death at London, for robbing of Churches and other
places; especially the collegiate Church of Saint Martins le grand in London;
for the which three of them were drawn to the Tower Hill, and there hanged and
burnt, the other two were pressed to death.

We have not heard of the hanging of any such Church robbers in these our
days, for Sublata causa tollitur effectus; the cause taken, or, if you will,
stolen away, the effect will consequently cease: For what man will venture a
turn at the Gallows, for a little small silver chalice, a beaten-out pulpit
cushion, an ore-worne Communion-cloth, and a course Surplisse? these are all
the riches and ornaments of the most of our Churches; and these are more, by
the Surplisse, then by some of the Parishioners may be thought perhaps fitting
to be allowed: such is now the slight regard we have of the decent setting
forth of sacred Religion. Of which a late writer, Sacred Religion, Sam. Daniell

Sit poorly without light; disrobd, no care
Of outward grace to amuze the poor devout.
Powerless, vnfollowed, scarcely men can spare
Three necessary rites to set thee out.
Either truth, goodness, virtue, are not still
The self same which they are; and always one,
But alter to the project of our will;
Or we our actions make them wait upon,
Putting them in the livery of our skill,
And cast them off again, when we have done.


CHAP. X. Of the rooting up, taking away, erazing and defacing of Funeral
Monuments in the reigns of King Henry the eighth, and Edward the sixth. Of the
care Queen Elizabeth, of famous memory, had, for the preservation of the same.
Her Proclamation in the second of her reign against defacing of Monuments.
TOward the latter end of the reign of Henry the eight, and throughout the
whole reign of Edward the sixth, Vid^. Parl. An. 2^. ^d 6. ca. 6.
and in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth, certain persons of every County
were put in authority to pull down, and cast out of all Churches, Roodes,
graven Images, Shrines with their relics, to which the ignorant people came
flocking in adoration. Or any thing else, which (punctually) tended to
idolatry and superstition. Under color of this their Commission, and in their
too forward zea^e, they rooted up, and ba^tered down, Crosses in Churches, and
Churchyards, as also in other public places, they defaced and brake down the
images of Kings, Princes, and noble estates; erected, set up, or pourtraied,
for the only memory of them to posterity, and not for any religious honor;
they cracked a pieces the glasse-windowes wherein the effigies of our blessed
Savior hanging on the Cross, or any one of his Saints was depictured; or
otherwise turned up their heels into the place where their heads used to be
fixed; as I have seen in the windows of some of our country Churches. They
despoiled Churches of their copes, vestments, Amices, rich hangings, and all
other ornaments whereupon the story, or the pourtraiture, of Christ himself,
or of any Saint or Martyr, was delineated, wrought, or embroidered; leaving
Religion naked, bare, and vnclad; as Dionysius left Jupiter without a cloak,
and Aesculapius without a beard. It will not seem distasteful, I hope, to my
Reader, nor impertinent to this purpose, if I shall relate the story.

Dionysius a Tyrant of Sicilie, spoiled the Churches, and took away a cloak
of gold from Jupiter, saying (scoffingly) a cloth-cloake was lighter for Summer
and warmer for Winter; he took likewise away from Aesculapius his golden
beard, saying it was a saucie part for him to have a long beard, and his father
Apollo to have none. But this his scoffing sacrilege was punished in his son
Dionysius, who was enforced to fly out of his own kingdom; to trudge up and
down like a runneagate, and in the end to lead a private life at Corinth.
Seldom says one, the children of them prosper, that scorn the false Gods,
and believe not in the true God. And how the posterity of these Commissioners
have prospered upon earth, or how punished after death, God knows all,
howsoever by men somewhat in their passages has been observed. Camd. in ^uff
For these hote-burning in zeal officers, got cloakes to hide their knavery,
and beards to visard their hypocrisy, and thereby under a goodly pretense of
reforming Religion, they preferred their private respects, and their own
enriching, before the honor of their Prince and country; yea and before the
glory of God himself.

But the foulest and most in humane action of those times, was the violation of
Funeral Monuments. Marbles which covered the dead were dug up, and put to
other uses (as I have partly touched before) Tombs hackt and hewne a pieces;
Images or representations of the defunct, broken, erazed, cut, or dismembered,
Inscriptions or Epitaphs, especially if they began with an orate pro anima, or
concluded with cuius animae propitietur Deus. For greediness of the brass, or
for that they were thought to be Antichristian, pulled out from the
Sepulchers, and purloined; dead carcases, for gain of their stone or leaden
coffins, cast out of their graves, notwithstanding this request, cut or
engraven upon them, propter misericordiam Jesus requiescant in pace. These
Commissioners, these (...), these Tombe-breakers, these graue-diggers, made
such deep and diligent search into the bottom of ancient Sepulchers, in hope
there to find (belike) some long-hidden treasure; Joseph. Antiq. Iud. l. 13.

called thieves, in old Inscriptions upon Monuments. Plutoni sacrum munus ne
attingite fures*
And in another place: Abite hinc pessumi fures.
But I have gone further then my commission, thus then to return.

This barbarous rage against the dead (by the Commissioners, and others
animated by their ill example) continued until the second year of the reign
of Queen Elizabeth, of famous memory, who, to restrain such a savage cruelty,
caused this Proclamation (following) to be published throughout all her
dominions; which after the imprinting thereof, she signed (each one severally)
with her own handwriting, as this was, which I had of my friend, Master
Humphrey Dyson.

ELIZABETH. A Proclamation against breaking or defacing of Monuments of
Antiquity, being set up in Churches, or other public places, for memory, and
not for superstition.
THe Queens Majesty understanding, that by the means of sundry people,
partly ignorant, partly malicious, or covetous; there has been of late years
spoiled and broken certain ancient Monuments, some of metal, some of stone,
which were erected up as well in Churches, as in other public places within
this Realm, only to show a memory to the posterity of the persons there
buried, or that had been benefactors to the building or dotations of the same
Churches or public places, and not to nourish any kind of superstition. By
which means, not only the Churches, and places remain at this present day
spoiled, broken, and ruinated, to the offense of all noble and gentle hearts,
and the extinguishing of the honorable and good memory of sundry virtuous and
noble persons deceased; but also the true understanding of diverse Families in
this Realm (who have descended of the blood of the same persons deceased) is
thereby so darkened, as the true course of their inheritance may be hereafter
interrupted, contrary to Justice, besides many other offenses that do hereof
ensue to the slander of such as either gave, or had charge in times past only
to deface Monuments of idolatry and false fained images in Churches and
Abbeyes. And therefore, although it be very hard to recover things broken and
spoiled: yet both to provide that no such barbarous disorder be hereafter
used, and to repair as much of the said Monuments as conveniently may be: Her
Majesty charge and commands all manner of persons hereafter to forbear
the breaking or defacing of any parcel of any Monument, or Tomb, or Grave, or
other Inscription and memory of any person deceased, being in any manner of
place; or to break any image of Kings, Princes, or nobles Estates of this
Realm, or of any other that have been in times past erected and set up, for
the only memory of them to their posterity in common Churches, and not for any
religious honor; or to break down and deface any Image in glasse-windowes in
any Church, without consent of the Ordinary: upon pain that whosoever shall
herein be found to offend, to be committed to the next Goal, and there to
remain without bail or mainprise, unto the next coming of the Justices, for
the delivery of the said Goal; and then to be further punished by fine or
imprisonment (besides the restitution or reedification of the thing broken) as
to the said Justices shall seem meet; using therein the advice of the
Ordinary, and if need shall be, the advice also of her Majesty's Council in
her Star Chamber.

And for such as be already spoiled in any Church, or Chapel, now standing:
Her Majesty charge and commands, all Archbishops, Bishops, and other
Ordinaries, or Ecclesiastical persons, which have authority to visit the
Churches or Chapels; to inquire by presentiments of the Curates, Churchwardens,
and certain of the Parishoners, what manner of spoils have been made,
since the beginning of her Majesty's reign of such Monuments; and by whom,
and if the persons be living, how able they be to repair and reedifie the
same; and thereupon to convent the same persons, and to enjoin them under
pain of Excommunication, to repair the same by a convenient day, or
otherwise, as the cause shall further require, to notify the same to her
Majesty's Council in the Star Chamber at Westminster. And if any such shall
be found and convicted thereof, no^ able to repair the same; that then they
be enjoined to do open pe^ance two or three times in the Church, as to the
quality of the crime and part^^ belongs under like pain of Excommunication.
And if the party that offended be dead, and the executours of the Will left,
having sufficient in their hands vnadministred, and the offense notorious; The
Ordinary of the place shall also enjoin them to repair or reedifie the same,
upon like or any other convenient pain, to be devised by the said Ordinary.
And when the offendour cannot be presented, if it be in any Cathedral or
Collegiate Church, which has any revenue belonging to it, that is not
particularly allotted to the sustentation of any person certain, or otherwise,
but that it may remain in discretion of the governor thereof, to bestow the
same upon any other charitable deed, as mending of highways, or such like;
her Majesty enioyneth and straightly charge the governors and companies of
every such Church, to employ such parcels of the said sums of any (as any wise
may be spared) upon the speedy repair or reedification of money such Monuments
so defaced or spoiled, as agreeable to the original, as the same conveniently
may be.

And where the covetousness of certain persons is such, that as Patrons of
Churches, or owners of the personages impropriated, or by some other color or
pretense, they do persuade with the Parson and Parishioners to take or throw
down the Bells of Churches and Chapels, and the lead of the same, converting
the same to their private gain, and to the spoils of the said places, and
make such like alterations, as thereby they seek a slanderous desolation of
the places of prayer: Her Majesty (to whom in the right of the Crown by the
ordinance of Almighty God* and by the Laws of this Realm, the defense and
protection of the Church (...) this Realm belongs) does expressly forbid any
manner of person, to ta^e away any Bells or lead of any Church or Chapel,
under pain of imprisonment during her Majesty's pleasure, and such further
fine for the contempt, as shall be thought meet.

And her Majesty charge all Bishops and Ordinaries to enquire of all such
contempts done from the beginning of her Majesty's reign, and to enjoin the
persons offending to repair the same within a convenient time. And of their
doings in this behalf, to certify her Majesty's privy Council, or the
Council in the Star Chamber at Westminster, that order may be taken herein.

Yeuen at Windsor the xix of September the second year of her Majesty's
reign. God save the Queen. Imprinted at London in Paul's Churchyard by Richard
Judge and John Cawood, Printers to the Queens Majesty.

Cum priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis.



This Proclamation was seconded by another, to the same purpose, in the
fourteenth year of her Majesty's reign, charging the Justices of her Assise
to provide severe remedy, both for the punishment and reformation thereof.

But these Proclamations took small effect, for much what about this time,
there sprung up a contagious brood of Scismatickes; who, if they might have
had their wills, would not only have robbed our Churches of all their
ornaments and riches, but also have laid them l^uell with the ground; choosing
rather to exercise their devotions, and publish their erroneous doctrines, in
some empty barn, in the woods, or common fields, then in these Churches,
which they held to be polluted with the abominations of the whore of Babylon.

Besides about that time these foresaid wilful Sectaries did pen, print, and
spread abroad certain seditious Pamphlets (as still they do) against our
book of Common Prayer; against all Ecclesiastical government, and against all
the rites and ceremonies used in this our orthodoxall Church of England;
inuenting out of their own corkie brains, a new certain no^orme of Liturgy
to themselves; thereby to bring into the Church all disorder and confusion.
These Renegadoes are (at this day) divided, and subdivided into as many
several Sects, as there be several Trades in the greatest Market-towne. As
into Brownists, Barowists, Martinists, Prophesiers, Solifidians, Famelists,
rigid Precisians, Disciplinarians, Judicial Thraskists, etc. and into a rabble,
numberless.

(...) of a book entitled, Conspiracy of pretended Reformation.
In the three and thirtieth year of Queen Elizabeth, the sixteenth day of July
in the morning, Edmund Coppinger and Henry Arthington, repaired to one Walkers
house near unto Broken warfe of London, where conferring with one of their
Sect, named William Hacket of Owndale in the County of Northampton, Yeoman,
they offered to anoint him king: But Hacket taking Coppinger by the hand, said,
You shall not need, for I have been already anointed in heaven by the holy
Ghost himself. Then Coppinger asked him what his pleasure was to be done: Go
your way both (said he) and tell them in the city, that Christ Jesus is come
with his fan in his hand to judge the earth. And if any man ask you where he
is, tell them he lies at Walkers house by Broken-wharfe; and if they will not
believe it, let them come and kill me if they can: for as truly as Christ
Jesus is in heaven, so truly is he come to judge the world. Then Coppinger
said it should be done forthwith: and thereupon went forward, and Arthington
followed, but ere he could get down the stairs, Coppinger ^ad begun below in
the house, to proclaim news from heaven of exceeding great mercy: that Christ
Jesus was come, etc. with whom Arthi^^^on also cried the same words aloude;
following him along the streets from thence by Warling-street, and Old Change
toward Cheap; they both adding beyond their commission, Repent England,
repent. After they had both thus come (with a mighty concourse of common
multitu^e) with an uniform cry into Cheap near unto the Gross, and there
finding the throng and prease of people to increase about them, in such sort a^
they could not well pass further, nor be conveniently heard of them all as
they desired: they got them up into an empty pease cart; wherein they stood
not only upon the words of their former cry, but reading something out of a
paper, they went more particularly over the office and ca^ling of Hacket, how
he represented Christ, by partaking a part of his glorified body, by his
principal spirit, and by the office of seuering the good from the bad. And
that they were two Prophets, the one of mercy, the other of judgment, called
and sent of God, to assist this their Christ Hacket in his great work. These
men were apprehended the same day. The 26, of July Hacket was arraigned, and
found guilty, as to have spoken diverse most false and traitorous words against
her Majesty; to have razed and defaced her Arms, as also her picture,
thrusting an iron instrument into that part which did represent the breast and
heart. For the which he had judgment, and on the 28. of July, he was brought
from Newgate, to a gibbet by the Cro^e in Cheap; where being moved to ask God
and the Queen forgiveness, be fell to railing and cursing of the Queen, and
began a most biasphemous prayer against the divine Majesty of God. They had
much ado to get him up the ladder; where he was hanged, and after bowelled and
quartered. His execrable speeches and demeanure as well at his arraignment, as
death, utterly distained and blemished all his former seeming sanctity,
wherewith he had shroudly possessed the common people. Thus you see how easily
ignorant people are seduced by false new doctrines, how suddenly they ^^ll from
true Religion into heresy, frenzy, and blasphemy; robbing the Church of all
her due rites, and (as much as in them lies) God of his Glory; which abuse, of
these times, I leave to be reformed by our reverend Clergy.

On the next day (to make an end of the Story) Edmund Coppinger having wilfully
abstained from meat, and otherwise tormented himself, died in Bridewell. And
Henry Arthington lying in the Counter in Woodstreet, submitting himself, writ
a book of repentance, and was delivered; such was the end of these men (says
mine Author) of whom the ^il^ie people had received a very reverend opinion,
both for their sincere holiness and sound doctrine.

And in the year 1612. April 11. Edward Wightman, another perverse heretic,
was burned at Lichfield. This Wightman would feign have made the people
believe, that he himself was the holy Ghost, and immortal, with sundry other
most damnable opinions, not fit to be mentioned amongst Christians. Yet for
all this, this heretic had his followers. It is much to be wished that all
backsliders from our Church, should be well looked unto at the first: and not
to run on in their puritanicall opinions. Of the Shcismatiques of those
times, and more especially of Martin Marprelate, these Rythmicall numbers
following were composed.

A certain Northern Rimer also made these following Couplets upon him and his
seditious Pamphlets: The Welchman is hanged,
Who at our Kirk flanged,
And at her state banged,
And brened are his buks.
And tho he be hanged;
Yet he is not wranged,

His name was John Penry a Welshman, a penner and a publisher of books,
entitled, Martin mar Prelate, he was apprehended at Stepney, by the Vicar
there, and committed to prison, and in the month of May 1593. he was
arraigned at the Kings bench in Westminster, condemned of Felony, and
afterward suddenly in an afternoon conuaied from the Gaile of the Kings Bench
to Saint Thomas Waterings, and there hanged with a small audience of beholders,
says Stow.

CHAP. XI. Of the conversion of this our Nation from Paganism to Christianity,
including generally the Foundations of religious houses in the same; and the
piety in the Primitive times; both of religious and Lay persons.
OF the conversion of this our Island, from Paganism to Christianity, diverse
authentical Authors, both ancient and modern, have written at large: a little
then of so much will suffice for this present Discourse.

Christiana doctrina sexaginta octo plus minus annorum spacio, N Harp^^i^ld.
(...) Angl Eccl. cap 1. (...) secul.
post passionem Domini nostri Jesus Christi, totum fere orbem peruagata est;
within the space of threescore and eight years, or thereabouts, after the
death and passion of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Christian Religion was
spread almost over the face of the whole world. And so fruitful and famous was
this spreading of the Gospel, that Baptista Mantuan, a Christian Poet,
compares the increase thereof with that of Noah, thus alleging unto it.

Sicutaquis quondam Noe sua misit in orbem
Pignora sedatis, vt Gens humana per omnes
Debita caelituum Patri daret orgia terras;
Sic sua cum vellet Deus alta in regna reuerti,
Discipulos quosdam transmisit ad vltima mundi,
Littora, docturos Gentes, quo numina ritu
Sint oranda, quibus caelum placabile Sacris.
As Noah sent from the Arc his sons, to teach
The Laws of God unto the world aright;
So Christ his Servants sent abroad to preach
The word of life, and Gospel to each wight;
No place lay shadowed from that glorious Light.
The farthest Isles, and Earths remotest bounds.
Embraced their Faith, and joyed at their sweet sounds.
Now to speak of the conversion of this Island out of a namelesse Author, A
Manus^^^pt in the Ea^le of Excesters ^^lemino^s Library.
who writes a book De regnis and Gentibus ad Christi sidem conuersis, thus:

Prima Prouinciarum omnium (sicut antiquissimi Historiarum Scriptores memoriae
prodidere, quorum etiam authoritatem M. A. Sabellicus inter nostrae aetatis
recentiores est sequutus) Britannia Insula, publico consensu, Christi fidem
accepit.

The first of all Provinces or far countries (as ancient Historiographers
have delivered to memory; whose authority M. A. Sabellicus, one amongst the
late writers of our age, does principally follow) this Island of Britain, by
common consent, received the Christian faith. The glorious Gospel of Jesus
Christ (says Gildas Albanius, Gild. de extud.^ Brit.
surnamed the wise, the most ancient of our British Historians) which first
appeared to the world in the later time of Tyberius Caesar, did even then
spread his bright beams upon this frozen Island of Britain. And it is
generally received for a truth, that Joseph of Arimathea (who buried the body
of our Savior Christ) laid the foundation of our faith in the West parts of
this kingdom, at the place, or little Island, as then called Aualon, now
Glastenbury; where he with twelve disciples his assistants, preached the
Gospel of life unto the Islanders, and found means there to build a Church or
Oratorie of wreathen wands, as also a little cell thereunto adjoining; and this
was the first religious house dedicated to the service of the true God in all
Britain: and these religious men the first beginners or founders of that
famous fenny-seated Monastery, which is partly standing at this day, of which
more hereafter, when I come to speak of the religious Foundations in
Somersetshire. In the mean while will you read what our countreyman John
Capgraue (in his Catalogue of English Saints) writes of Joseph's coming into
this kingdom. Thus in English.

Joseph with his son Iosephes (says he) and ten more of his assistants, sent
hither by Philip the Apostle out of France, for the inhabitants salvation,
preached zealously, and without fear, the true and lively faith; Aruiragus as
then swaying the Scepter of this land. The which Aruiragus, howsoever he was
unwilling at the first, to give them entertainment, or to hear them preach any
doctrine repugnant to the traditions of his predecessors, yet because they
came from such a far remote country as the holy Land, and that he saw their
civil behavior, their sanctity, and strict course in the manner of their
life and conversation, he gave them a certain Island to inhabit, in the West
part of his dominions, all compassed about with lakes and standing waters,
called Ynswitrim, or the glassie Isle; of which (says he) a certain Metrician
made this Tetrastich.

Intrat Analoniam duodena caterua virorum,
Flos Arimathie Joseph est primus eorum.
Iosephes ex Joseph genitus patrem comitatur,
Hijs alijsque decemius Glasconie propriatur.
George Owen Harry, in his Pedigrees, upon report from others, says, Joseph
brought over with him his sister Eurgaine, who afterward married a Britain,
whose name was Starklos.

John Harding, in his Chronicle of England, will have fourteen to accompany
Joseph in this journey, and that amongst many Britains converted by them to
the Christian faith; Aruiragus the king was one, to whom Joseph gave a shield
of the Arms, which now we call S. George his Arms; such are the rimes in the
English of those days, two hundred years since or thereabouts.

Cap. 47. and 48.
-- Joseph full holy and full wise
Of Arymathie with his fellows fourtene,
Into this land then came and gave contene
In Bretayne then this Joseph did convert
Brytons, as how to know the incarnacyon,
Before that Paynyms, and also peruerte
He taught them of his conuersacyon,
Of his passion, and his ressurection.
With other things as the Chronycler says,
That apperteyneth to Christ's faith.
Joseph converted king Aruiragus
By his prechyng, to know the law deuyne,
And baptized him as written has Nennius
The Cronycler in Bretayn tongue full syne.
And to Christ law made him enclyne.
And gave him a sheld of silver white,
A cross endlong, and ouertwhart full perfyte.
These Arms were used throughout all Bretayn
For a common sign each manne to know his nacyon
From enemies, which now we call certain,

And thus these Arms by Joseph's creacyon,
Full long before Saint George was generate
Were worshcipt here of mykell elder date.
The seeds of true Religion thus sown by the said Joseph and his associates;
near or upon (for about this account there is some difference amongst writers)
the year of our Savior Christ one hundred and fourscore, Lucius (surnamed
Lever Maur, Non Bana. hist sua genti^.
which signifies great brightness) king of the Britains; upon his request
made to Eloutherius Bishop of Rome (for as then, and many years after, the
title of Pope was altogether unknown) two learned Divines were sent unto him
from the said Bishop, at whose hands he received the lauer of baptism. And so
it sell out (our Histories say) that not only his wife and family accompanied
him in that happy course, Godwin de ^on. Brita.
but Nobles also and Commons, Priests and people, high and low, even all the
people within his Territories. And that generally all their Idols were then
defaced; the Temples of them converted into Churches, for the service of God,
the livings of their idolatrous Priests appointed for the maintenance of the
Priests of the Gospel: and that instead of 25. Flamines or high Priests of
their idols, there were ordained 25 Bishops, as also for three Archflamines,
three Archbishops, whereof one was seated at London, another at York, and a
third at Caerlion upon the river Vske in Wales. Of all which will it please you
peruse a few lines penned by my foresaid Author, John Harding.

In the year of Christ's incarnacyon,
An hundryd fourscore and ten,
Eleuthery the first, at supplicacyon
Of Lucius, sent him two holy men,
That called were Faganus and Damianus.
Faggan and Duvyen,
That baptized him and all his realm throughoute,
With hertes glad, and labor devout.
They taught the folk, the law of Christ each day,
And hallowed all the temples in Christ's name.
All mawment, and Idols cast away
Through all Bretayn, of all false Gods the same,
The Temples, Flamines the Idols for to shame,
They hallowed eke and made Bishops Sees,
Twenty and eight at diverse great citees,
Of three Archflamines, they made Archbishoprikes
One at London, Troynouant that hight,
For all Logres, with laws full authentikes
To rule the Church and Christentee in right.
Another at Carlyon a town of might,
For all Cambre; at Ebranke the third
From Trent North, for Albany is kide.
A Manuscript in the Heralds office.
Robert the Monk of Gloucester, an old rimer, who writes the language of our
fathers about four hundred years since, does summarily thus tell you, how
Joseph planted, and Luciu^ established the doctrine of Christ in this our
kingdom of Britain. His lives you will say are neither strong nor smooth; yet
perhaps they may give your palate variety: and as you like them, you shall have
more hereafter.

Christan faith was always both taught and embraced in this Island;
notwithstanding the continual persecutions of the Romans, Huns, Picts, and
Saxons, which last, made such desolation in the outward face of the Church,
that they drove the Christian Bishops into the deserts of Cornwall and Wales;
by whose labors the Gospel was plentifully propagated amongst those vast
mountains; and those parts above all other made glorious, by the multitudes of
their holy Saints and learned Teachers. Of which a namelesse Author mentioned
by Speed. Hist. cap 9.

Sicut erat celebris cultu numeroque Deorum;
Cum Iouis imperium staret, Britannica tellus;
Sic vbi terrestres coelo descendit ad oras
Expectata salus, patribus fuit inclyta sanctis.
Qui Neptunicolum campos, and Canibrica rura
Coryneasque casas loca desolata, colebant.
As were the Britains famous for their zeal
To Gentile Gods, whiles such they did adore;
So, when the Heavens to Earth did Truth reveal,
Blessed was that Land with Truth and Learning store.
Whence British plains and Cambrias desert ground,
And Cornewalls crags, with glorious Saints abound.
About the year six hundred, Christian Religion in this Island, being almost
totally eclipsed by several persecutions, Pope Gregory the first, being
zealously moved for the reconuersion of this English Nation, sent hither Austin
the Monk, with other his associates; to kindle anew the sparks of
Christianity, which were covered in the cinders of Pagans desolation. The story
is frequent, and I shall often touch upon it. Ethelbert being as then king of
Kent, received holy Baptism by the said Austin, being principally induced
thereunto, by Berta his wife and Queen, a Christian, daughter to Chilperuk
king of France. Christianity being thus received by him, the most potent king
of the Saxons. Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis.
The good example of the King
His people all to Christ did bring.
The succeeding Saxon kings followed his heavenly steps, endeavoring in all
they might, to overthrow the Synagogue of Satan, by breaking down the
abominable idols throughout the whole Island. Edwyne king of Northumberland;
Carpenwald, king of the East-English; Sebert king of the East Saxons, Kynigilds
king of the West Saxons, Peda king of the Merci^^s: Eth^^ulphe king of the
South Saxons, in the space of not much above threescore years, after the
conversion of King Ethelbert, were converted (...) God so wrought with them)
from Paganism and Idolatry, unto the belief and worship of our Lord Jesus
Christ: and the Christian faith was publicly preached in all their dominions.
These and other the Saxon kings for san^t^ty of life are ranked before all the
Kings and Potentates of the world For such was their fervent zeal in Religion,
that he thought himself most happy, who in pious acts, hard penance, weary
pilgrimages, and retired solitude, spent the various course of life, which
moved many of them to exchange a palace royal, and a Scepter imperial, for a
poor cell and a Mon^^^h st^^fe; to forsake their own kingdom, and to live as
pilgrims in a foreign country; to lose their own lines in warlike
opposition against Pagans and Infidels, thereby to live in heaven amongst the
noble army of Martyrs; and lastly, it moved them and other great personage^ so
^o^v^ng their pious examples, to erect and amply endow religious (...), as
Churches, Chapels, Schools, Colleges, and Monaste^^e (...) the preaching and
further propagating of the Christian faith. As you may see in the sequel of
these intended labors* Whose charters did (...) end with an execrable curse to
all those which by any manner of means should demolish or overthrow any of
such their sacred structures, or infringe, alienate, or diminish any of their
immunities, or yearly revenues. Likewise fearful comminations and
excommunications were threatened and thundered out against those which should
scorn, abuse, deceive, or craftily entrap any one, either of the secular, or
Monastical orders; and a benediction diuulged, and granted to all those by
whom they should be honored, reverenced, rewarded, and have their liuelihoods
further enricht: concluding with a promise to defend these religious Votaries
from the persecution of all humane enemies; and to maintain their li^e^^ies,
freedoms, and privileges from the usurpation of any secular power.

Their donations were sometime in meeter or rhyme, with the names of a number of
witnesses, whereunto the sign of the cross was ever added; the form of which
you may read hereafter: but the most of these their important writings were in
prose, and many of them wondrous short. For example, King Athelston gives a
certain plow-land and other profits to the Priest of the Church of high
Bickington in Denshire, in these words which I had from my friend, Master
Tristram Risdon that country man. Ich Athelston Konyng, Grome of his home,

To the government of these foresaid holy Fabrics, and their revenues, such
men were chosen as were the best learned, and most eminent for integrity of
life. The Priests consecrated by the imposition of hands; and appointed to say
prayers, administer the Sacraments, instruct the Christians which daily
increased; and to execute all such offices as belonged to a sacred Bishop or
venerable Pastor, were in such high and holy repute amongst the lay people, as
that when any of them were espied abroad, they would flock presently about
him, and with all reverence humbly beseech his Benisons, either by signing them
with the cross, or in holy prayers for them. And further (says Bid) it was
the manner in those primitive times, Lib. 4 cap. 27.
of the people of England, that when any of the Clergy, or any priest came to
a village, they would all by and by, at his calling, come together, to hear
the word, and willingly hearken to such things as were said, and more willingly
follow in works, such things as they could hear and understand. A wonderful
order of piety both in priest and people.

Chaucer in the prologue, to his Canterbury Tales, gives us the character of a
religious and learned priest, who in his holy actions did imitate the example
of the Clergy of these times, whereof I have spoken; but such were not to be
had by the dozens in his days, as by his writings appears.

The Parsone.
A good manne there was of religioun,
And was a poor Parsone of a town:
But rich he he was of holy thought and work
He was eke a learned manne and a clerk,
That Christ's Gospels truly would preach,
His Parishens devoutly would he teach.
Benign he was and wonder diligent,
And in adversity full patient.
And soch one he was proved often times.
sithes,
Full loath were him to curse for his tithes,
But rather would he yeuen out of doubt,
Unto his poor Parishens all about,
Both of his offering and of his substance,
He couthe in little thing have suffisaunce.
Wide was his parish and houses fer asander,
But he ne left neither for rain ne thonder,
In sikenesse in mischief for to visit
The ferdest in his Parish, much or lite,
Upon his feet, and in his hand a stafe:
This noble example to his sheep he yafe,
That first he wrought, and afterward taught,
Out of the Gospel he the words caught,
And this figure he added eke thereto;
That if gold rust what should iron do?
For yef a priest be foul, on whom we trust,
No wonder is a ignorant.
leude man to rust:
And shame it is, if a priest take keep,
To see a shitten Shepherd, and a clean sheep
Well ought a priest, ensample for to give
By his clennesse, how his sheep should live.
He set not his benefice to hire,
And let his sheep acomber in the mire,
And run to London, to saint Poules
To seken him a Chauntrie for souls:
Or with a brother head to be withold:
But kept at home and kept well his fold,
So that the wolf made him not miscary,
He was a shepherd, and not a mercenary.
And though he holy were, and virtuous,
He was not to sinful men despiteous,
Ne of his speech dangerous ne digne,
But in his reaching discrete and benign,
To drawn folk to heaven, with fairness,
By good ensample, this was his besinesse.
But if he were any person obstinate,
Whether he were of high or low estate,
Him would he snibbe sharply for the nonis,
A better priest I know no where non is.
He waited after no pomp ne reverence,
Ne maked him no spiced conscience;
But Christ's lore, and his Apostles twelve
He taught, but first he followed it him selue.
Bed. l. 1. ca. 26.
The Monastical orders likewise in that age, served God in continual prayer,
watching, and fasting, and preaching the word of life to as many as they could,
despising the commodities of this world, as things none of theirs, taking of
them whom they instructed, only so much as might serve their necessities;
living themselves according to that they taught to others, being ever ready to
suffer, both troubles, yea and death it self, in defense of the truth that
they taught.

Bed. li. 3 ca. 26.
And in another place, speaking of the religious and lay people in the North
country; They had no money (says he) but cattle, for if they took any money
of rich men, by and by they gave it to poor people. Neither was it needful
that either money should be gathered, or houses provided for the receiving and
entertainment of the worshipful and wealthy, who never came then to Church,
but only to pray and hear the word of God. The King himself, when occasion
served to come thither, came accompanied only with five or six persons, and
after prayer ended, departed. But if by chance it fortuned, that any of the
Nobility, or of the worshipful, refreshed themselves in the Monasteries, they
contented themselves with the religious men's fare and poor pittens, looking
for no other cates above the ordinary and daily diet. For then those learned
men and rulers of the Church, sought not to pamper the panch, but to save the
soul; not to please the world, but to serve God.

Wherefore it came then to pass, that even the habit of religious men was at
that time had in great reverence; so that where any of the Clergy or religious
person came, he should be joyfully received of all men, like the servant of
God. Again, if any were met going on journey, they ran unto him, and making
low obeisance, desired gladly to have his benediction either by hand or by
mouth. Also if it pleased them to make any exhortation as they passed by, every
man gladly and desirously hearkened unto them. Upon the Sondayes ordinarily the
people flocked to the Church, or to Monasteries, not for belly-cheare, but to
hear the word of God: And if any Priest came by chance abroad into the
village, the inhabitants thereof would gather about him, and desire to have
some good lesson or collation made unto them. For the Priests, and other of the
Clergy in those days, used not to come abroad into villages, but only to
preach, to baptize, to visit the sick, or (to speak all in one word) for the
cure of souls* Who also at that time were so far from the infection of
covetousness and ambition, that they would not take territories and
possessions toward the building of Monasteries, and erecting of Churches, but
through the earnest suite, and almost forced thereunto by noble and wealthy men
of the world: which custom in all points has remained a long time after
(says he) in the Clergy of Northumberland.

No less fervent in devotion, and austere in strictness of life, in these
days, were the religious Votaries of the female sex. I had almost forgotten
(says Capgraue) (in the prologue to his book of the English Saints) the
company of sacred virgins, which like lillies amongst thorns, despising all
carnal pleasures, with all the great pomp and riches of the world (many of
them being kings daughters) did in all chastity, poverty, and humility,
adhere only to their Savior Jesus Christ, their celestial Bridegroom, for
whose sake (as in this subsequent Treatise will be shown) they did undergo
many exquisite torments, and in the end were glorified with a crown of
martyrdom. Deus ex sexu elegens infirmiore vt fortia mundi confunderent.

In a Lieger book belonging sometime to the Abbey of Rufford, Mss. in bib.

I find these verses following of the constant sufferings of certain virgin
martyrs.

C. in Cheshire.
But I will conclude this Chapter with the words of Camden, speaking of the
Monastical life and profession.

The profession of this Monastical life (says he) began when Pagan Tyrants
enraged against Christians, pursued them with bloody persecutions. For then
good devout men, that they might serve God in more safety and security,
withdrew themselves into the vast wildernesses of Egypt, and not (as the
Painims are wont with open mouth to give it out) for to enwrap themselves
willingly in more miseries because they would not be in misery.

Where they scattered themselves among mountains and deserts, living in caves
and little cells, here and there in holy meditations. At first solitary and
alone: whereupon in Greek they were called Monachi, that is, Monks: but after
they thought it better (as the sociable nature of mankind required) to meet
together at certain times to serve God, and at length they began to cohabite
and live together for mutual comfort, rather then like wild beasts to walk
up and down in the deserts. Their profession was to pray, and by the labor of
their own hands to get living for themselves, and maintenance for the poor,
and withal they vowed poverty, obedience, and chastity. Athanasius first
brought this kind of Monks, consisting of laymen, into the West-Church.
Whereunto after that Saint Austen in Afrike. Saint Martin in France, and
Congell (one of the College of Bangor) in Britain and Ireland, had adjoined
the function of regular Clergy. It is incredible how far and wide they
spread, how many and how great Coenobies were built for them, so called of
their communion of life: as also Monasteries, for that they kept still a
certain show of solitary living: and in those days none were more sacred and
holy then they, and accordingly they were reputed; considering how by their
prayers to God, by their example, doctrine, labor, and industry, they did
exceeding much good, not only to themselves, but also to all mankind. But as
the world grew worse and worse, so those their holy manners, as one said, rebus
cessere secundis, that is, Gave backward in time of prosperity.

But of the piety of religious professors in the Primitive times, of the
sanctity of British and Saxon Kings, of their Queens, and issue royal; as
also of other persons of exemplarie zeal and holy conversation; I do speak
hereafter in particular, as I come to the places of their interments.

CHAP. XII. Of the fall or backsliding as well of religious persons, as of
lay people from the foresaid zealous ardour of piety.
THis heat of devotion, which I have spoken of, continued not long in this
Island. For as the Clergy and other religious orders, grew rich in fair
buildings, proud furniture, and ample revenues, so they daily increased in all
kinds of disorders; which was no sooner perceived, but put in practice by the
Laity: our kings declined from their former sanctity, and (which the worst
was) after their examples, many others (especially of the Nobility) did follow
their licentious traces. Examples of Princes being always of greater force
then other laws, to induce the people to good or to evil. Quint. declam. 4

In the year of Grace, 747 Cuthbert Archbishop of Canterbury, by the counsel
of Boniface Bishop of Mentz, called a Convocation at Cliffe beside Rochester,
to reform the manifold enormities wherewith the Church of England at that time
was ouergrowne. Our kings forsaking the company of their own wives, in those
days delighted altogether in harlots, which were for the most part Nuns. The
rest of the Nobility following their example, trod also the same trace. The
Bishops likewise, and other of the Clergy, that should have been a means of
the reforming these faults in others, were themselves no less faulty;
spending their times either in contentions and brables, or else in luxury and
voluptuousness, having no care of study, and seldom or never preaching
Whereby it came to pass, that the whole land was overwhelmed, with a most
dark and palpable mist of ignorance, and polluted with all kind of
wickedness and impiety, in all sorts of people. In which Convocation, after
long consultation with those his Bishops, or Suffraganes, and the rest of the
Clergy which were holden in greatest esteem for their learning, in number
thirty, for the reformation of these horrible abuses, endeavoring thereby
(like a good Pastor) to turn away the wrath of God which seemed to hang over
this land, and to threaten those plagues which not long after fell upon it,
when the Danes invaded the same.

Edgar, surnamed the peaceable, King of England in the year, 969. called
together his Bishops, and other of his Clergy, to whom he made this or the
like Oration, as follows.

For So Much as our Lord has magnified his mercy to work with us it is meet
(most reverend Fathers) that with worthy works we answer his innumerable
benefits: Allernd. ^^uall. a M ss in ^ib. Cot.

Stow Annal.


for neither by our own sword possess we the earth, and our own arms has
not saved us; but his right hand and his holy arm; for that he has been
pleased with us. Meet therefore it is, that we submit both our selves and our
souls to him, that has put all things under our feet; and that we diligently
labor that they whom he has made subject unto us, may be made subject unto
his laws. And truly it is my part to rule the Laity, with the law of equity,
to do just judgment betwixt man and his neighbors, to punish Church-robbers,
to repress rebels, to deliver the weak from the hands of his stronger; the
poor and needy from them that spoil them. And it also belongs to my care,
to have consideration to the health, quietness, or peace of the Ministers of
the Church, the flock of Monks, the companies of Virgins, and to provide the
things needful for them. The examining of whose manners belongs unto you, if
they live chastely, if they behave themselves honestly toward them which be
abroad, if in divine service they be careful, if in teaching the people
diligent, if in feeding sober, if moderate in apparel, if in judgment they be
discreet. If you had cured these things by prudent scrutinie (by your license I
speak O reverend Fathers) such horrible and abominable things of the Clerks
had not come to our ears. I omit to speak, that their Crown is not large,
nor their rounding convenient, but wantonness in apparel, insolency in
behavior, filthiness in words, do bewray the madness of the inward man.
Furthermore, how great negligence is there in the Divines, when in the holy
Vigils, they will scarce vouchsafe to be present, when at the holy solemnities
of the diuine-seruice, they seem to be gathered together to play and to
laugh, rather then to sing.

I will speak that which good men lament, and evil men laugh at. I will
speak with sorrow (if so be it may be spoken) how they flow in banquettings,
in chambering and wantonness, that now Clerks houses may be thought to be
brothell houses of harlots, and an assembly of plaiers. There is dice, there is
dancing and singing, there is watching till midnight, with crying and shouting.
Thus the patrimony of Kings, the alms of Princes, yea (and that more is) the
price of that precious blood is overthrown. Had our fathers therefore for this
purpose emptied their treasures? has the Kings bountifulness given lands and
possessions to Christian Churches for this end? that Clerks harlots should be
pampered with delicious dainties, that riotous guests may be prepared for; that
hounds and hawks, and such like toys may be gotten. Of this the Soldiers cry
out, the common people murmr, the i^sters and scoffers sing and dance, and
you regard it not; you spare it, you dissemble it. Where is the sword of Leuy,
and zeal of Simeon, which killed the circumcised Sichimites, being the figure
of them that defile the Church of Christ, with polluted acts, abusing Jacobs
daughter as an harlot? Where is the spirit of Moses, that spared not his
household, kinsfolk worshipping the head of the calfe? Where is the dagger of
Phin^es the Priest, who killing him that played the harlot with the Madianite,
with this holy emulation pacified Gods wrath? where is the spirit of Peter, by
whose power covetousness is destroyed, and Simoniall heresy condemned?
Endeavor to imitate, O ye Priests in God: It is time to rise against them that
have broken the Law of God. I have Constantines, you have Peter's sword in your
hands, let us join right hands, let us couple sword to sword, that the Leapers
may be cast out of the Church, that the hallowed place of our Lord may be
purged, and the sons of Leui may minister in the Church. Go to carefully, I
beseech you, lest it repent us to have done that which we have done, and to
have given that which we have given, if we shall see that not to be spent in
Gods service, but on the riotousnesse of most wicked men, though unpunished
liberty. Let the relics of holy Saints, which they scorn, and the reverend
Altars before which they rage, move you: Let the marvelous devotion of our
Ancestors move you, whose alms the Clerks fury abuses, etc. To you I
commit this business, that both by Bishoplie censure, and kingly authority,
filthy livers may be cast out of the Church, and they that live in order may
be brought in.

Not long after, Hen. Hunting. li. 6.
to wit, in the reign of Etheldred, commonly called, The unready, it was
foretold by an holy Anchorite; that for so much as the people of this Nation were
given over to all drunkenness, treason, and carelessness of Gods house; first
by Danes, then by Normans, and last of all by the Scots they should be
overcome. Of which hereafter.

whilst he lay sick of that sickness whereof he died, after he had remained
for two days speechless, on the third day lying for a time in a slumber, or
soft sleep, at the time of his waking, he fetched a deep sigh, and thus said.
O Lord God Almighty, if this be not a vain fantastical illusion, but a true
vision which I have seen, grant me space to utter the same unto these that
stand here present, or else not. And herewith having his speech perfect, he
declared how he had seen two Monks stand by him, as he thought, whom in his
youth he knew in Normandy to have lived godly, and died Christianly. These
religious men (said he) protesting to me that they were the messengers of God,
spoke these words. Because the chief governors of England, the Bishops, and
Abbots, are not the ministers of God, but the devils, the Almighty God has
delivered this kingdom for one year and a day into the hands of the enemy,
and wicked spirits shall walk abroad through the whole land. And when I made
answer that I would declare these things to the people, and promised on their
behalf, that they should do penance in following the example of the
Ninevites: they said again, that it would not be, for neither should the
people repent, nor God take any pity upon them And when is there hope to have
an end of these miseries? said I: Then said they, when a green tree is cut in
sunder in the middle, and the part cut off, is carried three acres breadth from
the stock, and returning again to the stoale, shall join therewith, and
begin to bud and bear fruit after the former manner, by reason of the sap
renewing the accustomed nourishment, then (we say) may there be hope that
such evils shall cease and diminish. With these words of the dying king, though
many that stood by were struck with fear; yet Stig and the Church-chopper,
Archbishop of Canterbury, made but a jest thereof, saying, that the old man
doted, and raued now in his sickness. Nevertheless within the same year the
truth of this prophetical dream or vision did plainly appear. When the
conqueror William seized into his hands, to glue unto the Normans, the most
part of every man's possessions in England; took from the Bishops Sees all
their ancient privileges and freedoms, bereaved all the Monasteries and
Abbeys of their gold and silver, sparing neither Shrine, Sir John Hayward in
vit. Will. Con.
nor Challice, appropriating the said religious houses, with their revenues to
himself, degrading and depriving as well Bishops, as Abbats of their seats and
honors, and detaining many of them in prison during their lives, that others
of his own followers might be placed in their rooms. R. Wendou^^ in bib.
Cotton.
By which means there was scarce left any man in authority of the English
nation to bear rule over the rest, insomuch that it was counted a reproach to
be called an Englishman.

William surnamed Rufus, son to the Conqueror, and king of England,
endeavoring to abate the tumorous greatness of the Clergy, restrained his
Subjects from going to Rome, Sir John Hay, in v. t. Will. Rufi.
withheld the annual payment of Peter pence, and was oftentimes heard to give
forth these words, They follow not the trace of Saint Peter, they greedily gape
after gifts and rewards, they retain not his power whose piety they do not
imitate. ^. ^^gden in Poly. lib. 7. cap. 9.
Nothing was now more in use then seasing, farming, and merchandising of
Church-liuings, and the chief agent in this business was one Ranulf Flambard,
the Kings Chaplain, afterward Bishop of Durham, for which he gave a thousand
pounds. Robert Bluet gave for the Bishopric of Lincoln, five thousand
pounds: and one Herbert Prior of Fiscane in Normandy bought for his father,
whose name was Losinge, the Abbacie of Winchester, and for himself the
Bishopric of Norwich. Will. Malms. de Reg. Mut. West. mon. Treuisa.
Whereupon a versi^ier of that age made these rythmes. Surgit in Ecclesia
monstrum genitore Losinga,
Symonidum secta, Canonum virtute resecta.
Petre nimis tardas, nam Simon ad ardua tentat:
Si praesens esses, non Simon ad alta volaret.
Proh dolor Ecclesiae nummis venduntur and aere,
Filius est Praesul pater Abbas Simon vterque.
Quid non speremus si nummos possideamus?
Omnia nummus habet, quid vult facit, addit, and aufert,
Res nimis iniusta, nummis sit Praesul and Abba.


Thus translated by Bale in his Votaries: A monster is up the son of Losinga,
Whiles the law seeks Simony to flea:
Peter thou sleep, whiles Simon takes time;
If thou were present, Simon should not clime.
Churches are prised for silver and gold,
The son a Bishop, the father an Abbot old.
What is not gotten if we have richesse?
Money obteineth, in every business
In Herberts way yet, it is a foul blot,
That he by Simony, is Bishop and Abbot.
But Simonie was not so common now as other sins; for the Clergy in general
gave themselves strangely to worldly pleasures, Higd. in Polych. lib. 7. cap. 6.
and pompous vanities; they wore gay rich garments, gilt spurs, embroidered
girdles, and bushie locks.

The Monks of Canterbury, as well nigh all other Monks in England, were not
unlike to secular men, Idem. lib* cod. (...).
they used hawking and hunting, playing at dice, and great drinking; thou
would have taken them to have been great Magnificoes rather then Monks,
they had so many servants and attendance of goodly array and dignity.

Anselme Archbishop of Canterbury, by the permission of King Henry the first,
Mat. Paris.
assembled a great Council of the Clergy at Westminster; wherein he deprived
many great Prelates of their promotions for their several offenses, and many
Abbots for other enormities; forbidding the farming out of Church dignities.

In the reign of King Henry the second, the abuses of Churchmen were grown
to a dangerous height, says well the Monk of Newborough, lib. 2. cap. 16. for
it was declared, says he, in the Kings presence, that Clergy men had
committed above an hundred murders in his reign: Of which nine years were,
as then, scarcely expired. And in the 23 of his reign, the Nuns of Amesbury
were thrust out of their house, because of their incontinent living. Rog. Houed.

Richard Cordelion, king of England, being told by a certain Priest called
Fulco, a Frenchman, that he kept with him three daughters, namely, pride,
covetousness, and lechery, which would procure him the wrath of God, if he did
not shortly rid himself of them: ^
answered, That he would presently bestow his three daughters in marriage; the
Knights Templers (said he) shall have my eldest daughter Pride: the white
Monks of the Cis^^ux order, Covetousness: and my third daughter Lechery, I
commit to the Prelates of the Church, who therein take most pleasure and
felicity. And there you have my daughters bestowed among you.

In the reign of Henry the third, ^
the Templars in London being in great glory, entertained the Nobility,
foreign Ambassadors, and the Prince himself very often, insomuch that
Matthew Paris, Monk of Saint Albans, who lived in those days, cried out upon
them for their pride, who being at the first so poor as they had but one horse
to serve two of them (in token whereof they gave in their seals two men upon
one horseback) yet suddenly they waxed so insolent, that they disdained other
orders, and sorted themselves with Noblemen. But this their insulting pride had
a quick period: ^
for shortly after, to wit, in the beginning of King Edward the seconds reign,
in the Council at Vienna, this their so highly esteemed order, was, upon
clear proof of their general, odious, abominable sins, and incredible
Atheistical impieties by them practiced, utterly abolished throughout all
Christendom: And by the consent of all Christian Kings, depo^ed all in one
day; taken all and committed to safe custody: And thus being polit^kely
apprehended, their lands and goods were seized upon: the heirs of the Donours
here in England, and such as had endowed these Templars with lands, entered upon
those parts of their ancient patrimonies after this dissolution, Tho. de la
(...)
and detained them until not long after they were by Parliament wholly
transferred unto the Knights of the Rhodes, ^
or of S. John of Jerusalem.

A litt^e before the universal extinguishment of this order of the Templars,
(...). M^rtyr. page 33^. (...) Edit.
Philip the French King caused 54. of that Order with their great Master to be
burnt at Paris; for their heinous ungodliness.

In the reign of Edward the third, the Clergy of England exceeded all other
Nations in the heaping up together of many Benefices, ^
and other spiritual promotions; besides, at that time, they held the
principal places both of trust and command in the kingdom. Some of them had
twenty Benefices with cure, and some more, and some of them had twenty
Prebends, besides other great dignities.

William Wickham at the death of William Edington Bishop of Winchester, was
made general Administratour of spiritual and temporal things pertaining to
that Bishopric, and the next year was made Bishop of Winchester. This
Wickham besides the Archdeaconry of Lincoln, and Prouostship of Wells, and
the Parsonage of Manihant in Devonshire, had twelve Prebends.

Simon Langham was Archbishop of Canterbury, and Chancelour of England.

John Barnet Bishop of Bath, and Treasurer of England.

Pope Urban the first, made a decree against the heaping together of many
Benefices, or spiritual promotions by one man, for the execution whereof he
sent commandment to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and by him to all his
Suffragans, to certify in writing, the names, number, and qualities, of every
Clerk, Benefices, or livings, within their several Diocese. Whereupon this
or the like certificate was brought in.

I find, inter Breui^ Regis* Ed. 3. Ann. 24. that William Fox Parson of Lee
near Gainsborough, Ex Archiuis ^urris London.
John Fox, and Thomas of Lingeston, Friars Minors of that Covent in Lincoln,
were indicted before Gilbert Vmfreuill, and other Justices, in partibus de
Lindesey, apud Twhancaster, die Sabbati post festum s^ncti Iohannis Baptiste,
in the said year, for that they came to Bradholme, a Nunnery in the County of
Nottingham, the eighteenth of the Kal. of February, and then and there
rapuerunt, and abduxerunt inde, contra pacem Domini Regis, quandam Monialem
nomine Margaretam de Euernigham Sororem dicte Domus, exeuntes eam habit.
Religionis, and induentes eam Rob. virid. secular. ac etiam diuersa bona ad
valenc. quadragint. solid. Violently took and forcibly from thence carried
away, against the peace of their Sovereign Lord the King, a certain Nun by
name Margaret de Euernigham, a sister of the said house, stripping her quite
out of her religious habit, A green Gown given to a Nun.
and putting upon her a green Gown, Robe, or Garment of the secular fashion,
and also diverse goods to the value of forty shillings.

In this Kings reign Robert Longland a secular Priest, borne in Shropshire, at
Mortimers C^liberie, writ bitter inuectiues against the Prelates, and all
religious orders in those days, as you may read throughout this book, which
he calls, The vision of Piers Plowman.

Presently after, in the reign of Richard the second, John Gower flourished,
who in his book called, A Manus. in Sir Robert Cottons Library.
Vox clamantis, cries out against the Clergiemen of his time; first, Quod
Christi scholam dogmatizant, and eius contrarium operantur. 2 Quod potentiores
alijs existunt. 3 Quod carnalia appetentes vltra modum delicate vinunt. 4 Quod
lucris terrenis inhiant, honor Prelacie gaudent, and non vt prosint, sed vt
presint, Episcopatum desiderant. Quod legibus positi^is quae quamuis ad cultum
anime necessary non sunt, infinitas tamen constitutiones quasi quotidie ad
eorum lucrum nobis grauiter impon^^t. Quod bona temporalia possidentes,
spiritualia omittunt. Quod Christus pacem suis discipulis dedit and reliquit;
sed Prelati propter bona terrena guerras contra Christianos, legibus suis
positiuis, instituunt, and prosequuntur. Quod cleri sunt bellicosi. Quod
scribunt and docent ea quae sunt pacis, sed in contrarium ea quae sunt belli
procurant. Quod nomen sanctum sibi presumunt, appropriant tamen sibi terrena,
nec alijs inde participando ex caritate subueniunt. Quod intrant Ecclesiam per
Symoniam. Quod honores and non onera Prelacie plures affectant, quo magis in
Ecclesia cessant virtutes, and vitia multipliciter accrescunt. Quod Rectores in
curis residentes, cu^^s tamen negligentes, venationibus praecipue, and
voluptatibus penitus intendunt. Quod Presbyteri sine curis, sieve stipendarij
non propter mundici^m, and ordinis honestatem, sed propt^r mundi otia gradum
Presbyteratus appetunt and assumunt. Much more he speaks against the abuses
and vices of Churchmen, as also against the lewd lives of the Scholars in
Cambridge and Oxford, which he calls the Churches plants: concluding thus his
third book: Sic quia stat cecus morum sine lumine clerus
Erramus Laici nos sine luce vagi.


In his fourth book he speaks of Monks, and all other religious Orders:
Quod contra primi ordinis statuta abstinentie virtutem linquunt, and delicias
sibi corporales multipliciter assumunt. Ripping up their faults in particular.

Chaucer who was contemporarie and companion with Gower, in the Plowmans tale,
the Romant of the Rose, and in his Treatise which he intitles, lack Vpland,
writes as much, or more, against the pride, covetousness* insatiable luxury,
hypocrisy, blind ignorance, and variable discord amongst the Churchmen, and
all other our English votaries. As also how rude and unskillful they were in
matters and principles of our Christian institutions; to whose works, now
commonly in print, I refer my Reader, for further satisfaction.

In a Parliament holden at Westminster, the eleventh year of King Henry the
fourth, the lower house exhibited a Bill to the King and the Lords of the upper
house in effect as follows.

To the most excellent Lord our King, Tho. Walsing. Fabian The like bill or
petition was exhibited in Parliament, an. 9. Ric. 2.
and to all the Nobles in this present Parliament assembled, your faithful
Commons do humbly signify, that our Sovereign Lord the King might have of
the temporal possessions, lands, and revenues which are lewdly spent,
consumed, and wasted, by the Bishops, Abbats, and Priors, within this Realm;
so much in value as would suffice to find and sustain one hundred and fifty
Earls, one thousand and five hundred Knights, six thousand and two hundred
Esquiers, and one hundred Hospitals, more then now be.

Speed. Walsing.
But this Petition of spoiling the Church of England of her goodly patrimonies,
which the piety and wisdom of so many former ages had congested, was by the
King (who was bound by oath and reason to preserve the flourishing estate of
the Church) so much detested, that for this their proposition, he denied all
other their requests: and commanded them that from thenceforth they should not
presume to intermeddle with any such matter.

This King, as also his son, and grandchilde, were wondrous indulgent to the
Clergy; although they were daily disquieted with the bellowing of the Popes
Prouisorie Bulls. For Henry the fifth was so devour and serviceable to the
Church of Rome and her Chaplains, that he was called of many, the Prince of
Priests. ^ox. Martyr. page 6.^^ vlt. Ed.
And Henry the sixth, surnamed the holy, wa an obedient child, and no less,
nay more obsequious to the Sea Apostolical, then any of his predecessors;
howsoever I find that once he rejected the Popes Bull, (...) Arch. Turris
London. An. 16. ^^. 6.
concerning the restoring of the Temporalities of the Bishoppricke of Ely.

And now give me leave a little to digress, speaking somewhat by the way of
the denomination of this word Bulla, and why the Bishops of Rome call their
leaden Seals, by which they confirm their writings, Bulls. This word Bulla
was called (...), Joseph. Castaleon. page 288.
id est, a Consilio, of council. For that anciently a golden Bull, broach, or
ornament, round and hollow within, was usually fastened about the necks or
breasts of young children, and semblably to all their pictures, signifying
thereby, that their render unbridled age ought to be governed by the grave
council, and good advise of others, of more maturitie in years. And from
hence the Bishops of Rome borrowed the name for their leaden Seals; upon one
part of which the name of the Pope is to be read: on the other, the head of
Saint Paul on the right side of the Cross, and of Saint Peter on the left are
to be seen. Honoris tamen non praelationis gratia factitatum hoc ab Ecclesia.
Nam quanquam S. Petrus sit Princeps Apostolici ordinis, tamen Ecclesia voluit
eos indiscretae esse excellentiae. But this was done of the Church (says my
Author) in regard of honor, not of pre-eminence; For although Saint Peter be
the head of the Apostolic Order, yet the Church will have them to be of an
vndistinct excellence.

Now the Popes per liter as suas bullatas Regi directas, did prefer whom they
pleased, and how they pleased, to any Ecclesiastical promotion here in
England. One example for all.

Innocent the seventh by his Bull preferred Richard Fleming, first to the
Bishopric of Lincoln, then to the Archbishopricke of York, and lastly drive
him back again by his roaring Bull to his first preferment of Lincoln. All
which this King thus ratifies.

Cum nuper summus Pontifex Richardum tunc Episcopum Lincoln: a vinculo quo
eidem Ecclesie tenebatur absolnerit; Ex Arch. ^urris Lon. 2. pars. pat. An 4
Hen. 6.
ad Ecclesiam Ebor: transtulerit. Nec non a vinculo quo eidem Ecclesie Ebor.
cui tunc preerat, tenebatur, absoluit ipsum; ad prefat. Lincoln. Ecclesiam
duxerit restituend. and transferand. ipsumque in Episcopum Ecclesie Lincoln.
prefecerit. Rex fidelitatem cepit ipsius Episcopi and restituit ei temporalia.
Test Rege apud West. 3. Augusti.

Such was the absolute authority of the Pope; In bib Cott.
whose name (says a namelesse Author) was never Peter, except you grant Saint
Peter to be one and the first, (howsoever many of them have had that name
given unto them in baptism) the reason whereof is thus diliuered:

Nemo ex omnibus Romanorum Pontificibus Petri nomen sibi assumpsit, (etsi
nonnulli in Baptismate ita nominati) ex quadam erga Apostolorum Principem
reuerentia.

Now let me return, this Digression being much longer then I expected, as also
this Chapter, which I will conclude as briefly as I may; in the mean while
take this short story, which I find in the fourth part of Sir Edward Cokes
reports, Act. de Scandalis.

The Abbot of S. Albons commanded his servant to go into the Town, An. 22. Ed.
^. Rot. 20.
or some place near adjoining, and to desire a certain man's wife to come unto
him, with whom (he said) he had an earnest desire to talk: The servant obeyed,
and (like a good trusty Roger) performed his Masters commandment, in bringing
the woman to his private chamber. Now so soon as the Abbot and the wife were
together, the servant (well knowing his masters mind) withdrew himself out of
the way; and left them together alone in the chamber. The Abbot then began to
accoast the wise; telling her first, that her array was mean, poor, and
gross array; to which she answered, That her array was according to her small
ability, and the ability of her husband. The Abbot (knowing in what most of
women take the greatest delight) told her that if she would be ruled by him,
she should have as good array to wear, as the best woman in the Parish where
she dwelt; and so began to solicit her chastity. The woman giving no ear
to his libidinous motions, the Abbot assaulted her with struglings and baudy
embracings, thinking to get that by force which he could not obtain by fair
means. But she still resisted all his encounters, promises, and persuasions,
by which he detained her in his chamber a long time against her will. The
husband having notice of this abuse offered to his wife; began to talk of the
matter, and said that he would have an Action of false imprisonment against the
Abbot, for detaining his wife against her will so long in his chamber. The
Abbot hearing of this (adding one sin to another) did sue the innocent poor
husband in the Ecclesiastical Court upon an Action of defamation, because
(forsooth) the husband had given out, and published abroad, that my Lord Abbot
would have made his wife a dishonest woman. The matter being opened in the
Court, the husband had a Prohibition, etc.

This cunning sin (amongst other their crimes) was usually put in practice by
the Churchmen of other countries; witness Francis Petrarch Archdeacon of
Parma in Italy, in one of his Epistles, sine titulo, to his namelesse friend;
wherein he anatomises the Roman Clergy. Thus translated. Epist ^0.


Here Venus with her wanton toys,
Is honored with base bauds and boys;
Adultery, whoredom, and incest,
Is honored here among the best:
And counted but for sports and plays
Even with our Prelates of these days.
The wife is ravished from her spouse,
And to the Papal seat she bows.
The poor go^d man must leave the Town,
Such ordinances are set down:
And when her bel^^e rises hie,
By Cardi^als who with her lie,
The husband must not dare complain,
But take his wife with child again.
And dangerous it was for a Layman in John Gowers days, to accuse any of the
Clergy with a matter of truth. As you may perceive by the sequel.

Vox Clam. lib. 3. ca. 21.
Hoc dicit clerus quod quamuis crimine plenus
Sit, non est laici ponere crimenei.
Alter and alterius cleri peccata fauore
Excusat, quod in hijs stat sine lege reus.
Non occusari vult a caliis, tamen illos
Accusat, que sibi libera frena petit.
Libera sunt ideo peccata placentia Clero
Sit nisi quod Laici iura ferantur ibi.
Presbiter insipiens populum facit insipientem,
Et mala multa parit, qui bona pauca sapit.
Plough man's ^^le.
Chaucer writes of the same.

Men's wives they woollen hold,
And though that they been right sorye,
To speak they shull not be so bold
For sompning to the Consistory:
And make hem say mouth I lie
Though they it saw with her iye,
His Lemman holden openly
No man so hardy to ask why.
They ^aine to no man that it longs
To reprove them though they err.
Sir Thomas Moore reports how (in this kings days) a poor man found a Priest
ouer-familiar with his wife; Camd. Re^iq.
and because he spoke it abroad, and could not prove it, the Priest sued him
before the Bishops Official for defamation, where the poor man in pain of
cursing was commanded, that in his Parish Church, he should upon the Sunday
stand up, and say, Mouth thou lie. Whereupon for fulfilling of his penance,
up was the poor soul set in a pew, that the people might wonder at him, and
hear what he said; and there all aloud (when he had rehearsed what he had
reported by the Priest) then he set his hands on his mouth, and said, Mouth
thou lie. And by and by thereupon, he set his hands upon both his eyes, and
said, But eyne, by the Mass, ye lie not a whit.

Abbots and Priours in these days did ouer-awe all sorts of lay people, yea
the greatest Potentates: which made Edward the fourth write thus to the Priour
of Jews in Sussex, more like a poor petitioner then a great Prince,
concerning a matter wherein the Prior and Covent went about to cousin his
servant Vincent.

Dear and well-beloved in God, Transcribed out of the o^^^ginall.
we greet you well: and where we been enformyd yat many years past, by yowr
letters endentyd, under yowr Couuent Seal, grauntyd to owr trusty and

favor and recomendacyon of owr good grase. Yeuen under owr Signet at owr palas
of Westminstre the xix day of Iun.

To ouerpasse the short time during the Protectorship and reign of King
Richard the third, let us come unto Henry the seventh, in whose days religious
persons did wallow in all kinds of voluptuousness; to the Kings no little
grief, who by his breeding under a devout mother, as also in his own nature
was ever a zealous obseruer of religious forms. To bridle whose incontinent
lives, he caused an Act to be made bearing this title.

An Act to punish Priests for their incontinencie. Of which, so much as will
serve for this purpose:

Item. For the more sure and likely reformation of Priests, Clerks, and
religious men, In Pa^l. anno 3. Hen. 7. cap. 4.
culpable, or by their demerits openly reported of incontinent living in their
bodies, contrary to their Order: It is enacted, ordained, and stablished by the
advice and assent of the Lords spiritual and temporal, and the Commons in the
said Parliament assembled, and by authority of the same, That it be lawful to
all Archbishops, and Bishops, and other Ordinaries, having Episcopal
jurisdiction, to punish and chastise Priests, Clerks, and religious men, being
within the bounds of their jurisdiction, as shall be convicted before them by
examination and other lawful proof, requisite by the Law of the Church, of
Aduoutrie, Fornication, Incest, or any other fleshly incontinencie, by
committing them to ward and prison, there to abide for such time, as shall be
thought to their discretions convenient, for the quality, and quantity of
their trespass: And that none of the said Archbishops, Bishops, or other
Ordinaries aforesaid, be thereof chargeable, of, to, or upon any Action of
false or wrongful imprisonment, but that they be utterly thereof discharged in
any of the cases aforesaid, by virtue of this Act.

In his sons reign, the Pope being (here in England) at the point vertical
of his all-commanding power, and religious Orders grown to the height of their
abominable sins, both of them had a sudden downfall, as will appear in the
subsequent Chapters.

But of the piety and impuritie of Monks and other religious Votaries, of the
first and latter times, take for a conclusion of this, as also of the precedent
Chapter, these riming Hexameters as I have them out of the book of Rufford
Abbey, in Nottinghamshire: a Manuscript in Sir Robert Cottons Library.

Inuectio Walonis Britonis in Monachos.
Sacrilegis Monachis emptoribus Ecclesiarum
Composui Satyram.
Ordo Monasticus Ecclesiasticus esse solebat,
Dura cibaria dum per agrestia rura colebat.
Nulla pecunia, nulla negocia prepediebant,
Sobria copia, parua colonia sufficiebant.
Pro venialibus and capitalibus inuigilabant;
Tam venalia quam capitalia nostra placebant.
Ordo Monasticus Ecclesiasticus est violenter
Ecclesiastica comparat omna dona potenter.
Ordo Monasticus Ecclesiasticus est sine fructu,
Intrat ouilia desuper ostia non sine luctu.
Ordo Monasticus Ecclesiasticus est sine causa,
Clamat ad ostia spiritualia iam sibi clausa.
Ordo Monasticus Ecclesiasticus inde vocatur,
Quando rapacibus atque tenacibus assimulatur.
Terra, pecunia, magna Palatia, templa parantur
Vnde potencia, sieve superbia magnificantur.
Desunt caetera.
CHAP. XIII. Of the abrogation, abolition, and extinguishment of the Popes
supreme and exorbitant authority, within the King of Englands Dominions.
KIng Henry the eighth upon occasion of delay, made by Pope Clement the
seventh, in the controversy of diuorcement betwixt him and Queen Katherine,
and through displeasure of such reports as he heard had been made of him to
the Court of Rome: or else pricked forward by some of his Counselors, to
follow the example of the Germans; caused Proclamation to be made on the
eighteenth day of September, In bib. Cott.
Anno reg. 22. forbidding all his subjects to purchase or attempt to purchase
any manner of thing from the Court of Rome, containing matter prejudicial to
the high authority, jurisdiction and prerogative Royal of this Realm; or to
the hinderance and impeachment of the Kings Majesty's noble and virtuous
intended purposes. Upon pain of incurring his Highness indignation, and
imprisonment, and further punishment of their bodies, for their so doing, at
his Graces pleasure, to the dreadful example of all other.

Not long after, Ex Parl. an. 24. Hen. 8. cap. 12.
it was enacted, that appeale^, such as had been used to be pursued to the Sea
of Rome, should not be from thenceforth, had, neither used but within this
Realm; and that every person offending against this Act, should run into
the dangers, pains, and penalties, of the Estatute of the Provision and
Praemunire, made in the five and twentieth year of the reign of King Edward
the third; and in the sixteenth year of King Richard the second.

And shortly after this, it being thought by the ignorant vulgar people; that
to speak against any of the laws, decrees, ordinances, and constitutions of
the Popes, made for the advancement of their worldly glory and ambition, Ex.
Parl. an. 25. Hen. 8 ca. 21.
was damnable heresy; it was enacted that no manner of speaking, doing,
communication, or holding against the Bishop of Rome, called the Pope, or his
pretensed authority or power, made or given by humane laws or policies, and
not by holy Scripture; nor any speaking, doing, communication, or holding
against any Laws, called Spiritual Laws, made by authority of the Sea of
Rome, by the policy of men, which were repugnant and contrariant to the Laws
and Statutes of this Realm, or the Kings Prerogative royal, should be deemed,
reputed, accepted, or taken to be Heresy.

It was also enacted that no manner of appeals, In eod. Parl. cap. 19.
should be had provoked, or made, out of this Realm, or any the Kings
dominions to the Bishop of Rome, or to the Sea of Rome, in any causes or
matters, happening to be in contention, and having their commensement and
beginning in any of the Courts within this Realm, or within any the Kings
dominions, of what nature, condition, or quality soever they were.

Upon this followed another Act, In eod Parl. cap. 20.
restraining the payment of Annates, or first fruits, to the Bishop of Rome,
and of the electing and consecrating of Bishops within this Realm.

Another Act was made concerning the exoneration of the Kings Subjects, In eod
Parl. cap. 20.
from exactions and impositions, theretofore paid to the Sea of Rome, and for
having licenses and dispensations within this Realm, without suing further for
the same: in which the Commons assembled complain to his Majesty, that the
subjects of this Realm, and other his dominions, were greatly decayed and
impouerished by intolerable exactions of great sums of money, claimed and
taken by the Bishop of Rome, and the Sea of Rome, as well in pensions, censes,
Peter-pense, procurations, fruits, suits for provisions, and expeditions of
Bulls for Archbishoprickes and Bishoprics, and for delegacies of rescripts in
causes of contentions, and appeals, jurisdictions, legatiue; and also for
dispensations, licenses, faculties, grants, relaxations, Writs, called Perinde
valere, rehabitations, abolitions, and other infinite sorts of Bulls, breeues,
and instruments of sundry natures, names, and kinds, in great numbers, over
long and tedious here particularly to be inserted.

S^o^. Annal.
It was affirmed in this Parliament, that there had been paid to the Pope of
Rome only for Bulls, by our English Bishops, and other of the kingdom, since
the fourth of Henry the seventh to that time, threescore thousand pound
sterling.

An. 2^. Hen. 8. c^p. 1.
The next year following, in a Parliament begun at Westminster, the third of
November, the Pope with all his authority was clean banished this Realm, and
order taken that he should no more be called Pope, but Bishop of Rome; and the
King to be taken and reputed as supreme head in earth of the Church of England,
called Anglicana Ecclesia. And that he their Sovereign Lord, his heirs and
successors kings of this Realm, should have full power and authority, from
time to time, to visit, repress, redress, reform, order, correct, restrain,
and amend all such e^rours, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, and
enormities whatsoever they were, which by any manner spiritual authority or
jurisdiction, ought or might lawfully be reformed, repressed, ordered,
redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, most to the pleasure of Almighty
God, the increase of virtue in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of
peace, unity, and tranquillity of this Realm, any usage, custom, foreign
laws, foreign authority, prescription, or any thing, or things, to the
contrary thereof notwithstanding.

Cap (...)
In this Parliament also were granted to the King and his heirs, the
first fruits and tenths of all spiritual dignities and promotions.

(...). Hen. 8. cap. ^.
His style of supremacy was further ratified, and declared to be set down in
this form and manner following: in the Latin tongue by these words.

Henricus octauus Dei gratia, Angliae, Franciae, and Hiberniae Rex, Fidei
defensor, and in terra Ecclesiae Anglicanae and Hibernicae supremum caput. In
the English tongue by these:

Henry the eight, by the grace of God, King of England, France, and Ireland,
defendour of the faith, and of the Church of England, and also of Ireland in
earth, the supreme head.

Which style was enacted, to be united and annexed for ever to the imperial
Crown of this his Highness Realm of England.

Upon the first expulsion of the Popes authority, and King Henry's undertaking
of the Supremacy; the Priests both religious and secular, did, openly in their
Pulpits, so far extol the Popes jurisdiction and authority, that they
preferred his laws before the kings; yea and before the holy precepts of God
Almighty. Whereupon the King sent his mandatory letters to certain of his
Nobility, and others in especial office, thinking thereby to restrain their
seditious false doctrine and exorbitancie. And here let me tell you that
amongst many letters of important affairs, which I found in certain Chandlers
shops of our Parish, allotted to light Tobacco pipes, and wrap up peniworths of
their commodities (all which I gave to Sir Robert Cotton, Knight and Baronet,
the only repairer of ruined antiquirie, whom I knew (the contents thereof
showing some passages of former times) would preserve them for better uses; I
happened upon certain letters following tending to the same purpose: of which
I have already spoken.

Henry R. By the King.

RIght trusty and right welbiloued Cousin we great you well. And where it is
commen to our knowlaige that sundry persons, as well religious as seculer
Priests and curats in their peroches and d^ue^se places within this our Realm,
do dailly asmoche as in them is, set fo^the, and extolle the jurisdiction and
authority of the Bishop of Rome, ortherwyse called Pope, sowing their
sediciouse pestylent and false doctrine, praying for him in the Pulpit, and
making him a God, to the great deceyte, illudyng and seducyng of our
subgietts, bryngyng them into errors, sedicyon, and evil opynyons, more
preferryng the power, laws, and Iurisdictyon of the said Bishop of Rome, then
the most holly laws and precepts of almighty God. We therefore myndyng not only
to provide for an unity and quietness to be had and continued among our said
subgietts, but also greatly cou^tyng and desyryng them to be brought to a
perfectyon and knawlege of the mere verity and truth, and no longer to be
seduced, nor blinded, with any such superstitiouse and false doctrine of any
erthly usurper of godds laws, will therefore and command you, that where and
whenever ye shall find, apperceyve, know, or heretell, of any such sedicious
persons, that in such wise do spread, teache, and preach, or otherwise set
forth any su^he opynyons and perniciouse doctrine; to the exaltatyon of the
power of the bishop of Rome, bryngyng thereby our subgietts into error, gruge,
and murmuracyon; that ye indelaydly do apprehend and take them, or cause them
to be apprehended and taken, and so committed to Ward there to remain without
bail or mayneprise, until upon your advertisement thereof unto us or our
Council ye shall know our further pleasure in that behalf. Ye uen under our
Signet, at our Manor of Grenwich the xvii day of April.


This letter was thus endorsed: To our right trusty and welbiloued cousin and
Counselor Therle of Sussex.

In June or July following, these maiesticall commanding Epistles were
seconded, and made more strong by an Act of Parliament, called, An Act
extinguishing the authority of the Bishop of Rome. Of which I hold it not
amiss to set down so much as principally tends to the purpose. To begin then
at the beginning.

For as much as notwithstanding the good and wholesome laws, Ex Parl. an. 28.
Hen. 8. ca. 10.
ordinances, and statutes heretofore made, enacted, and established by the
kings Highness, our most gracious sovereign Lord, and by the whole consent of
the high Court of Parliament, for the extirpation, abolition, and
extinguishment out of this Realm, and other his graces dominions, seigniories,
and countries, of the pretended power and usurped authority of the Bishop of
Rome, by some called the Pope, used within the same or elsewhere, concerning
the same realm, dominions, segniories, or countries, which did obfuscat and
wrest Gods holy word and Testament a long season from the spiritual and true
meaning thereof, to his worldly and carnal affections: as pomp, glory,
avarice, ambition, and tyranny, covering and shadowing the same with his
humane and politic devises, traditions, and inventions, set forth to promote
and stablish his only dominion, both upon the souls, and also the bodies and
goods of all Christian people, excluding Christ out of his kingdom and rule of
man's soul, as much as he may, and all other temporal Kings and Princes out
of their dominions; which they ought to have by Gods law, upon the bodies and
goods of their subjects: whereby he did not only rob the Kings Majesty, being
only the supreme head of this his Realm of England, immediately under God, of
his honor, right, and pre-eminence, due unto him by the law of God, but
spoiled his Realm yearly of innumerable treasure, and with the loss of the
same deceived the Kings loving and obedient subjects, persuading to them by his
laws, bulls, and other his deceiuable means, such dreams, vanities, and
fantasies, as by the same many of them were seduced and con^ueied unto
superstitious and erroneous opinions; So that the Kings Majesty, the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this Realm, being ouer-wearied
and fatigated with the experience of the infinite abominations and mischiefs,
proceeding of his impostures, and craftily coloring of his deceits, to the
great damages of souls, bodies, and goods, were forced of necessity for the
public weal of this Realm, to exclude that foreign pretended jurisdiction
and authority, used and usurped within this Realm, and to devise such
remedies for their relief in the same, as does not only redound to the honor
of God, the high praise and advancement of the Kings Majesty, and of his
Realm, but also to the great and inestimable utility of the same; And
notwithstanding the said wholesome laws so made and heretofore established,
yet it is common to the knowledge of the Kings highness, and also to diverse
and many his lo^uing, faithful, and obedient subjects, how that diverse
seditious and contentious persons, being imps of the said Bishop of Rome and
his See, and in heart members of his pretended Monarchy, do in corners, and
elsewhere as they dare, whisper, inculke, preach, and persuade, and from time
to time instill into the ears and heads of the poor simple and unlettered
people, the advancement and continuance of the said Bishops feined and
pretended authority, pretending the same to have his ground and original of
Gods law, whereby the opinions of many be suspended, their judgments
corrupted and deceived, and diversity in opinions augmented and increased, to
the great displeasure of almighty God, the high discontentation of our said
most dread sovereign Lord, and the interruption of the unity, love, charity,
concord, and agreement that ought to be in a Christian Region and
congregation. For avoiding whereof, and repression of the follies of such
seditious persons, as be the means and authors of such inconveniences: Be it
enacted, ordained, and established by the King our sovereign Lord and the
Lords spiritual and temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament
assembled, and by the authority of the same, that if any person or persons,
dwelling, demurring, inhabiting, or resiant within this Realm, or within any
other the Kings dominions, seigniories, or countries, or the marches of the
same, or elsewhere within or under his obeizance and power, of what estate,
dignity, pre-eminence, order,, degree, or condition soever he or they be,
after the last day of July, which shall be in the year of our Lord God, 1536.
shall by writi^g, ci^ering* printing, preach^ing, or teaching, deed or act,
obstinately or maliciously, hold or st^nd with, to extol, set forth,
maintain, or defend the authority, jurisdiction, or power of the Bishop of
Rome, or of his See, heretofore claimed, used or usurped within this Realm, or
in any dominion or country, being or, within, or under the Kings power or
obeisance: or by any presence obstinately or maliciously invent any thing* for
the extolling, advancement, setting forth, maintenance, or defense of the same,
or any part thereof, or by any pretense obstinately or maliciously attribute
any manner of jurisdiction, authority, or pre-eminence to the said See of
Rome, or to any Bishop of the same See for the time being within this Realm,
or in any the Kings dominions and countries: That then every such person or
persons, so doing or offending, their aiders, assistants, comfortors, abettors,
procurers, maintainers, fautors, counselors, conceilours, and every of them,
being thereof lawfully convicted, according to the Laws of this Realm; for
every such default, and offense, shall incur and run into the dangers,
penalties, pains, and forfeitures, ordained and provided by the statute of
Provision and Praemunire, made in the sixteenth year of the reign of the noble
and valiant Prince King Richard the second, against such as attempt, procure,
or make provision to the Sea of Rome, or elsewhere, for any thing or things, to
the derogation, or contrary to the Prerogative royal, or jurisdiction of the
Crown, and dignity of this Realm.

King Henry still hearing of the murmuring of his Subjects, upon the enacting
of this Statute, writes again to his principal magistrates in every country,
in this manner following.

Henry R. By the King.

TRusty and well-beloved we great you well; And whereas heretofore as ye know both
upon most just and virtuous fowndacions grownded upon the laws of Almighty
God, and holy Scripture; And also by the deliberate advice, consultacion,
consent and agreement as well of the Bishops and Clergy, as by the Nobles and
Commons temporal of this owr realm, assembled in owr high Court of
Parliament, and by auctorite of the same; the abuses of the Bishop of Rome his
auctorite and jurisdiction, of long time usurped against us, have been not
only utterly extirped, abolished, and secluded; but also the same owr Nobles
and Commons both of the Clergy and Temporalty by an other several Act, and
upon like fundacion for the public weal of this our realm, have united,
knytte, and annexed to us and the Crown imperial of this our realm, the
title, dignity, and style of Supreme head in earth, immediately under God, of
the Church of England; as undoubtedly evermore we have been; which thing also
the said Bisshops and Clergy particularly in their Conuocacions have holly and
entyrely consented, recognized, ratifyed, confirmed, and approved authentiquely
in writing both by their special oaths, profession and writing under their
Signs and Seals, so utterly reuouncyng all other oaths, obedience, and
jurisdiction, either of the said Bishop of Rome, or of any other Potentate. We
late you wit that prependyng and considering, the charge and commission, in
this behalf given unto us by almighty God togedre with the great quietness,
rest, and tranquillity that hereby may ensue to owr faithful Subgiects, both
in their conscience and otherwise, to the pleasure of almighty God, in case the
said Bisshops and Clergy of this our realm should sincerely, truly and
faithfully set forth, declare and preche unto our said Subgiects the very
true word of God, and without all manner color dissimulacion and hypocrisy,
manifest, publishe and declare the great and innumerable enormities and abuses,
which the said Bishop of Rome, as well in title and style, as also in
auctorite and jurisdiction of long time unlawfully and iniustly has usurped
upon us our Progenitors and all other Christen Princes; have not only
addressed our letters general to all and every the same Bisshops straitely
charging and commaundyng them, not only in their propre persons to declare
teache and preche unto the people the true, mere, and sincere word of God, and
how the said title, style, and jurisdiction of supreme head apperteyneth to us,
our Crown and dignity royal; and to gyve like warnyng, monicion, and charge
to all Abbots, Priors, Deanes, Archdeacons, Prouosts, Parsons, Vicars, Curats,
Scolemasters, and all other Ecclesiastical persons within their Diocesses to
do the semblable; in their Churches every Sunday and solemn feast, and also
in their scoles: And to cause all manner prayers, orysons, Rubricks, and Canons
in Massebokes, and all other books used in Churches, wherein the said Bishop
is named, utterly to be abolished, eradicated, and rased, in soche wise as the
said Bishop of Rome, his name and memory for evermore (except to his contumely
and reproach) may be extinct, suppressed, and obscured. But also to the
Justices of our Peace, that they in every place within the precinct of their
Commissions do make and cause to be made diligent search, wait, and espiall
whedder the said Bisshops and Clergy do truly and sincerely, without any
manner cloak, or dissimulacyon execute accomplish their said charge, to them
committed in this behalf. And to certifye us and our Councail of such of them
as should omytt or leave undone any part of the premises, or else in the
execucyon thereof should coldely or faynedly use any manner synistre addicyon
interpretacion or cloak, as more plainly is expressed in our said letters. We
considering the great good, and furtheraunce, that ye may do in thise matiers
in the parties about you, and specially at your being at Sises and Sessions, in
the declaracion of the premises, have thought it good, necessary, and
expedient to write thise letters unto you, whom we esteem to be of soch
singler zeal and affection, toward the glory of Almighty God, and of so
faithful and loving heart toward us, as ye woll not only with all your
wisdoms, diligences, and labors accomplish all soche things as might be to the
preferment and setting forwards of Gods word, and the amplification, defense,
and maintenance of our said interesse, right, title, style, jurisdiction, and
auctorite apperteyning unto us, our dignity, prerogative, and Corone imperial
of this our realm; will and desire you, and nevertheless straitely charge and
command you, that laying aparte all vayn affections, respects, and carnal
consideracions, and setting before your ees the mirror of truth, the glory of
God, the right and dignity of your Sovereign Lord, thus sounding to the
inestimable unity and commodity both of your selfs, and all other our loving
and faithful Subgiects; ye do not only make diligent search within the
precinct of your Commission and auctorite, whedder the said Bisshops and
Clergy do truly and sincerly as before preche, teache, and declare to the
people the premises according to their duties; but also at your said sitting
in Sises and Sessions ye do persuade, show, and declare unto the said people,
the very tenor, effect, and purpose of the premises, in soch wise as the said
Bisshops and Clergy may the better not only do thereby and execute their said
duties, but also the parents, and rulers of families, may declare, teache, and
inform their childer and servaunts in the specialties of the same, to the
utter extirpacion of the said Bisshops usurped authority, name, and
jurisdiction for ever. Showing and declaring also to the people, at your said
Sessions, the treasons treacherously committed against us, and our laws, by
the late Bishop of Rochester and Sir Thomas More knight, who thereby, and by
diverse secret practices of their maliciouse mynds against us, intended to
seminate, engender, and bread amongst our people and subgiects a most
mischievous and sediciouse opinion not only to their own confusion, but also of
diverse others, who lately have condignely suffered execucion, according to
their demerites: And in soche wise dilating the same with persuacions, to the
same our people, as they may be the better rixed, established and satisfied in
the truth; and consequently that all our faithful and true subgiects may
thereby detest and abhor in their hearts and heads, the most recreaunt and
trayterouse abuses and behaviors of the said maliciouse malefactors as they be
most worthy. And finding any defaulte, negligence, or dissimulacion in any
manner of person or persons, not doing his duty in this party. Ye immediately
do advertise us and our Counsel of the defaulte, manner and facion of the
same, Lating you wit, that considering the great moment, weight, and
importance of this matter, as whereupon depends the unity, rest, and
quietness of this our Realm, if ye should contrary to your duties, and our
expectation and trust, neglect, be slake, or omytte to do diligently your
duties, in the true performaunce and execucion of our mind, pleasure, and
commandment as before; or would haulte, stumble at any part, or specialtie of
the same; Be ye assured that we, like a Prince of Justice, will so punyshe and
correct your defaulte and negligence therein, as it shall be an example to all
others how contrary to their allegiance, oaths, and duties, they do frustrate,
deceive, and disobey the just and lawful commandment of their sovereign
Lord, in such things, as by the true hearty and faithful execucion whereof,
they shall not only prefer the honor and glory of God, and set forth the
majesty and imperial dignity of their soueraign Lord, but also importe and
bring an inestimable unity, concord, and tranquillity of the public and
common state of this Realm: whereunto both by the laws of God, and nature,
and man, they be utterly obliged and bounden. And therefore fail ye not most
effectually, ernestly, and entierly to see the premises done, and executed;
upon pain of your allegiance, and as ye well advoyd our high indignacion and
displeasure at your utmost perils. Y even under our Signet, at our Manor besides
Westminster the xxv day of June.


Henry R. By the King:

TRusty and well-beloved we great you well; And whereas we chiefly and
principally regarding and tendering the quiet, rest, prosperity, and
tranquillite of our Nobles and Commons, and their conservacion no less then
our own; directed lately our letters unto you and other Justices of our Peace
throughout this our Realm, containing our admonicion and gentill warenyng, to
have such special regard to the duties of your offices according to the trust
we have in you; that not only for thymportance it is both unto us and our
commonwealth, ye should see our high dignite of Supremacy of our Church
(wherewith it has pleased almighty God by his most certain and undoubted word
to endowe, and adorn, our auchtorite, and Corone imperial of this our Realm)
to be set forth and impressed in all our Subjects hearts and mynds, and to
forsee that the mayntenors of the Bishop of Rooms usurped and feigned
auctorite, with all his Papisticall supersticions and abuses, wherewith he has
in times past abused the multitud of our subgiects (of whose yoke, tyranny, and
skornefull illusion we have by Gods porveiaunce delivered this our realm, and
of other his Satellites which secretly did uphold his faction) should be by you
diligently serched, enqwired, and tried out, and so brought to our Justices to
receive condign punyshement, according to their demerits; but also that tale
tellers about the cuntriee, and spraders of rumors, and false inventors of
news, to put owr people to fear, and stir them to sedicyon, should be
apprehended, and punyshed to the terrible example of others. Also that
vagabonds and valiant Beggars shall be avoided and have worthy corrections. And
for the same purpose to keep watches, and to see commen Justice with
indifferency, and without corrupcion to be observed and ministered, unto all owr
Subgiects like as by the porporte and contents of our said Letters ye may more
amply perceive. We have thereupon ben credably informed that sundry of you
have, for a time, so well done yowr duties, and endeuoired your selves in
fulfilling our admonitions, and caused the evil doers to be punyshed according
to their demerites, that our loving Subgiects have not ben disquieted of a long
season, until now of late that sum ungracious, cankred, and maliciouse persons
have taken boldness to attempt, with sundry devilish persuasions to move and
seduce our true subgiects, using false lies, and most untrue rumors; And
amonst them we understand, sundry Parsons, Vicars, and Curats of this our
Realm to be chieffe; which to bring our people to darkness, of their own
perverse mind, not only to blind our Commons, do read so confusely, hemming
and hacking the word of God and soche our Injunctions, as we have lately set
forth, that almost no man can understand the true meaning of the said
Injunctions, but also secretly have suborned certain spreders of Rumors and
false tales in corners, which do interpreat and wrast our true meaning and
intention of owr said Injunctions to an untrue sense. For whereas we have
ordained by owr said Injunctions for thavoyding of sundry strives, processis,
and contentions, risyng upon aege, upon lineall discents, upon title of
Inheritances, upon legittimation or Bastardie, and for knowledge whither any
person is our subject borne or no; Also for sundry other causes, that the names
of all childer christened from hensforth with there birth, there fathers and
mothers names, and likewise all marriages, and burialls, with the time and date
thereof should be registered from time to time in a book in every Parish Church,
surely and safe^y to be kept. They have bruted and blown abroad most falsely
and vntrewely that we do entende to make some new exactions at all
christenyngs, weddings, and burials: The which in no wise we ever meaned or
thought upon, a^leging (for to fortefy and color there false and manif^st lies)
that therein we go about to take away the liberties of the realm. For
conservacion whereof they feign that Bishop Beckett of Canterbury, which they
have to fore called Saint Thomas, died for where in deed there was never soch
thing done, nor meant in that time nor since. For the said Beckett never
swarved nor contended with owr progenitor King Henry the second, but only to
let that those of the Clergy should not be punyshed for their offenses, nor
iustyfyed by the Courts and laws of this Realm, but only at the Bisshops
pleaser, and after the decrees of Room. And the causes why he died, was upon a
wilful reskewe and a fray by him made and begone at Canterbury; Which was
nevertheless afterward alleged to be for soche liberties of the Church which
he contendyd for, during his life, with tharchbisshop of York: chiefly to have
soche privilege that no King of England ought ever to be crowned by any other
Bishop but oonly by the Bishops of Canterbury. Yea and in case he should be
absent or fugitive out of the Realm, the King should never be coroned by any
other, but constrained to abide his return. These and soche other detestable
and unlawful liberties of the Church, nothing concerning the common weal, but
only the party of the Clergy, the said Thomas Becket most arrogantly desired,
and trayterouslye sewyd to have, contrary to the law of this our Realm. To the
which most false interpretacions and wrasting of our true meaning, they have
joined such myscheuous lies and false tales for markyng of catals, and like
seditious devises; whereupon owr people were lately stirred to sedition, and
insurrection, to there utter ruin and destruction; onles almighty God (who by
his divine providence gave unto us habundance of force, as he always does
unto rightful Princes) had so with clemency illumyned us, that where as we
with thedge of the sword, and by our laws might have overthrown and
destroyed them, there wives, children and posterite for ever, we nevertheless,
as ye can right well remember, extended upon them at that time, our benign and
merciful pardon. These miserable and Papisticall superstitious wretches,
nothing regarding the same, nor caring what danger and myschiefe our people
should incur, have both raised the said old rumors, and forged new sedicious
tales, intendyng, asmoche as in them lies, a new commotion, and all to
satisfye there cankred hearts. Wherefore and for the imminent danger to you, and
all our good subgiects, and the troble that might ensewe, unless good and
ernest provision to repress them, be taken thereupon; We desire and pray you,
and nevertheless straytly charge and command you, that within the Precinct
and lymyts of yowr charge; ye shall not only endeavor your self, and employ your
most diligence, to inquyre and find out such cankerd Parsons, Vicars, and
Curats, which do not trewly and substancially declare our said Injunctions,
and the very word of God, but momble confusely, seying that they be compelled
to read them; and bydd there Parishens nevertheless to do as they did in times
past, to live as there fathers, and that the old fashion is the best, and other
crafty sedicious parables. But also with your most effectual vigilance, do
enserche and try out such sedicious tale tellers, and spreders abroad of such
brutes, tidings, and rumors, touching us in honor, or surety of the state of
our Realm, or any matacion of the laws or customs thereof* or any other thing
which might cause any sedicion. And the same with there setters forth,
maintenors, counsaylors, and fautors with all dilygence to apprehend, and
commytt to ward and prison without bail or maynprise, till upon evidence to
be given against them, at tharriuall of our Justices in that country, or
otherwise upon yowr advertisement to us, or our Counsel to be given, and our
further pleaser known, they may be punyshed for their seditious demerites,
according to the law: to the fearful example of all other. Employing and
endeavoring yowr selfs thereunto so ernestly and with soche dexterite, as we may
have cause to think that ye be the men, which above all things desire the
punishment of evil doers and offenders. And will let for no travail, to set
forth all things for the commen peace, quiet, and tranquillite of this our
Realm. And like as the danger is imminent no less to your self and your
neighbors then to other; so ye of yowr own mind should procure and see with
celerite our Injunctions, laws, and Proclamations, as well touching the
Sacramentaries, and Anabaptists, as other to be set forth to the good
instruction and conservacion of our people, and to the confusion of those which
would so craftily undermine our commonwealth, and at the last destroy both you
and all other our loving subgiects, although we should give unto you no such
admonicion. Therefore fail ye not to follow the ^ffect, admonicion, and
commandment both in our said letters, and in these presents contained, and to
communicate the hole tenor of these our letters, with soche Justices of our
Peace, your neighbors and other in that shire, and to give unto them the true
copye thereof: exhorting them, like as by these presents we desire, and pray
them, and nevertheless straytly charge and command them, and every of them,
that they will show their diligence, towardnes, and good inclinacion to join
with you and other of your sort, And that every of you for his own part see
the same put in execucion accordingly, as ye and they tender our pleasur, and
will deserve our condign thanks. Y even under our Signet at our Manor of
Hampton Corte the day of December.


CHAP. XIIII. Of the policy used by King Henry the eighth, and his Council,
in the expelling of the Popes authority out of his Dominions.
THus you have seen the abrogation and extinguishment of the Popes usurped
authority here in England, and the establishment of that power in the Crown
imperial, which was not rashly attempted by his Majesty; but undertaken upon
mature deliberation, and proceeded in, by the advice, consultation, and
judgment of the most great and famous Clerks in Christendom: amongst which
number, was that pure Orator and learned divine Philip Melanchton; whose
presence here in England (after his opinion) the king much desired; as by this
letter following, sent to Secretary Cromwell from the Duke of Norfolk, and
Viscount Rocheford appears.

Master Secretary after our most hearty commendacions, ^
ye shall understand that having received the letters sent unto you from Sir
John Wallop, and showed the same unto the Kings Majesty, his pleasure
thereupon was that we should dispatch these owr letters incontynently unto you
concerning thaccomplishment and doing of these things ensuing. First, his
graces pleasure is that you shall immediately upon the receipt hereof, dispatch
Barnes in Post with Deryk in his company into Germany, commanding him to use
such diligence in his iournay, that he may, and it be possible, mete with
Melanchton, before his arryuall in France, and in case he shall so mete with
him, not only to disuade his going thither, declaring how extremely the French
king does persecute all those that will not grant unto the Bishop of Romes
usurped power, and jurisdiction; vsyng in this part all persuasions, reasons,
and means that he can devise, to empeach, and let his said iornay thither,
layeng unto him how much it should be to his shame, and reproach, to vary and
goo now from that true opinnion wherein he has so long continued. But also on
the other side to persuade him all that he may to convert his said iournay
hither, showing as well the conformity of his opinnion and doctrine here, as the
nobility and virtues of the Kings Majesty, with the good entretaynement which
no doubt he shall have here at his grace hand. And if percase the said Barnes
shall not meet^ with him before his arrival in France; then the said Barnes
proceeding himself forth in his Iournay toward the Princes of Germany, shall
with all diligence return in post to the Kings highness the said Derik, with
the advertisement of the certainty of Melanchtons coming into France, and such
other occurrants as he shall then know. And if the said Derik be not now ready
to go with him, the Kings pleasure is, you shall in his stead appoint and send
such onn other with the said Barnes, as you shall think mete for that purpose.

And when the said Barnes shall arrive with the said Princes of Germany, the
Kings pleasure is, he shall on his grace behaulfe as well persuade them to
persist and continue in their former good opinion concerning the denial of the
Bishop of Romes usurped authority, declaring their own honor, reputacion, and
surety to depend thereon, and that they now may better mayntain their said
just opinion therein then ever they might, having the kings Majesty, oon of
the most noble and puissant Princes of the world, of like opinion and
judgment with them, who, having proceeded therein by great advise,
deliberacion, consultacion, and judgment of the most part of the great and
famous Clerks in Christendom, will in no wise relent, vary, or alter in that
behalf, as the said Barnes may declare and show unto them, by a book made by
the Deane of the Chapel, and as many of the Bishops Sermons as ye have,
which book ye shall receive herwith, the copies whereof, and of the said
Sermons, ye must deliver unto the said Barnes at his departure, for his better
remembrance and instruction. To whom also his graces pleasure is, ye shall show
as much of Sir John Wallops letter which we send you also again, as ye shall
see drawn and merkt with a pen in the mergent of the same. As also exhort
and move them in any wise to beware how they commyt any of their affairs to
thorder, direction, or determinacion of the French King, considering he and his
counsel be altogether Papist, and addict and bent to the mayntenance and
confirmacion of the Bishop of Romes pretended authority. Furthermore the Kings
pleasure is, ye shall upon the receipt hereof immediately cause Master Haynes and
Christofer Mount in post to repair into France to Sir John Wallop, in as
secret manner as they can, as cummyng like his friends to visit him, and not
as sent by the King. And in case they shall by him or otherwise learn and know
that Melanchton is there arrived, then his grace would that the said Haynes and
Mount shall, in such sort as they be not much noted, resort unto him, and for
the disuading of his continuance there, or alteration of his opinion, and
alluring of him hither, to use such reasons and persuasions as be before
written, with such other as they can further devise for that purpose. To the
which Haynes and Mount the Kings pleasure is, ye shall deliver like copies of
the said Deanes book, and Bishops Sermons to be showed unto the said
Melanchton, or otherwise used, as may be most expedient for thachyeuement of
the Kings purpose in that behaulfe.

Ye shall also understand that the kings pleasure is, ye shall write to Sir
John Wallop, and send unto him therewith like copies; willing him in case he
shall have certain knowledge that tharticles be true written in these his
letters concerning the French Kings sending into Germany, for the continuance
of the Bishop of Romes pretended supremacy, to repair with the said copies to
the French King, and not only to set the same forth with such reasons as he can
devise in that part, showing how much it shall be against his honor, both to
give himself subject to the said Bishop, and move other to do the semblable,
but also to declare unto him, that the Kings highness remembering his old friendly
promises concerning the mayntenance of his cause, and of his procedyngs
touching the same, cannot think it a little strange that the said French King
(seeing his Majesty has in his doings touching the said Bishop of Rome, moved
neither his nor any Princes subjects) will m^ue and styr the Germayns to
condescende upon a contrary opinion, both to themselfs, and to his grace in
this behalf; And that his Majesty must needs think this Amytie much touched
in that he should move any state or cuntrie to do that thing, which is so
much against the Kings highness and his own promise, using all the ways to
disuade him from the dishonorable obedience of the said Bishops See, moving him
to inclyne to the Kings just opinion touching the same.

Finally the Kings pleasure is, ye shall write an other letter to the Bishop of
Aberden, signifying that the Kings Majesty takes it very unkindly that the
King his Nephieu would now embrace without his advise or counsel, being his
derest friend and Uncle, and now in liege and Amytie with him, the marriage of
Mounsieur de vandous daughter, whereunto he would give non ear at his graces
ouerture hertofore made of the same. In your seid letter imputing a great
negligence therein to the said Bishop and other of his Masters counsel, seeing
their Master shows not in the doing thereof such amytie toward the Kings
highness, as the friendship between them does require. And to make an end, his
grace will in no wise that Barnes of Haynes shall tarry for any further
instruction of the Bishop of Canterbury, or any other, his grace having
determined to send the same after by Master Almoner and Heth: but that he,
Master Haynes, and Mount shall with all possible diligence depart immediately in
post without longer tarying then for this their depeche shall be necessary,
so as their abode empeche not the Kings purpose touching the said Melanchton.
And thus fare you most hartly well.

From Langley in much have this Monday at iiii of the clock at after none.
Your loving Friends, T. Norffolk. George Roc^ford.



Also, before the beginning of that Parliament wherein the Popes supreme
authority here in England was abolished, these remarkable Inductions following
were set down, and commanded by the King and his Council to be suddenly put
in execution.

First, to send for all the Bishops of this realm, and specially for such as
be nerest to the Court, Out of the said Mss. in bib. Cot.
and to examine them a part, whether they by the law of God can prove and
justify, that he that now is called the Pope of Rome is above the general
Counsel, or the general Counsel above him; Or whether he has given unto
him by the law of God any more auctority within the realm, then any other
foreyn Bishop.

Item, to devise with all the Bishops of this realm, to set forth, preach,
and cause to be preched to the Kings people, that the said Bishop of Rome
called the Pope, is not in auctoryte above the general Counsel, but the
general Counsel is above him and all Bishpos. And that he has not by Gods
law any more jurisdiction within this realm then an other foreign Bishop,
being of any other realm has. And that such auctority as he before this has
usurped within this realm, is both against Gods law, and also against the
general Counsalles; Which usurpation of authority only has grown to him by
the sufferance of Princes of this realm, and by none auctority from God.

Item, therefore that order be taken for such as shall preach at Paul's Cross
from henceforth, shall continually from Sunday to Sunday preach there, and also
teach and declare to the people, that he that now calls himself Pope,
nether any of his Predecessors is and were but only the Bishops of Rome, and
has no more authority and jurisdiction by Gods law within this realm, then
any other foreign Bishop has, which is nothing at all. And that such
authority as he has claimed heretofore has been only by usurpation and
sufferance of Princes of this realm. And that the Bishop of London may be
bound to suffer none other to preach at Paul's Cross, as he will answer, but
such as will preach and set forth the same.

Item, that all the Bishops within this realm be bound and ordered in the
same wise, and cause the same to be preached throughout all their Diocesses.

Item, that a special practice be made, and a straight commandment given to
all Prouincialls, Ministers, and rulers of all the four Orders of Friars
within this realm, commanding them to cause the same to be preached by all the
Preachers of their religions, and through the whole realm.

Item, to practice with all the Friars Obseruants of this realm, and to
command them to preach likewise; or else that they may be stayed, and no^
suffered to preach in no place of the realm.

Item, that every Abbot, Prior, and other heads of religious houses within this
realm, shall in like manner teach their Conuents and brethren, to teach and
declare the same.

Item, that every Bishop shall make special commandments to every Parson,
Vicar, and Curate within his Diocese to preach and declare to his Parishoners
in likewise.

Item, Proclamations to be made throughout the realm containing the whole Act
of Appeals; And that the same Act may be impressed, transumed, and set up on
every Church door in England, to the intent that no Parson, Vicar, Curate, nor
any other of the Kings subjects shall make themselves ignorant thereof.

Item, the Kings prouocations and appellations made from the Bishop of Rome
unto the general Council, may also be transumed, impressed, published and set
up on every Church-doore in England, to the intent that if any censures should
be fulminate against the king or his realm, that then it may appear to all
the world, that the censures be of none effect, considering that the king has
already, and also before any censures promulged, both provoked and appealed.

Item, like transumpts to be made, and sent into all other realms and
dominions, and specially into Flanders, concerning the kings said prouocations
and appellations, to the intent falsehood, iniquity, malice, and injustice of
the Bishop of Rome may thereby appear to all the world. And also to the intent
that all the world may know that the Kings highness standing under those
appeals, no censures can prevail, neither take any effect against him and his
realm.

This could not well be done before the Parliament.
Item, a letter to be conceived from all the Nobles, as well Spiritual as
Temporal of this Realm, unto the Bishop of Rome, declaring the wrongs
injuries, and usurpations used against the kings highness and this realm.

Item, to send exploratours and espies into Scotland, and to see and perceive
their practices, and what they intend there; And whether they will confederate
themselves with any other outward Princes.

Item, to send letters for that purpose to the Earl of Northumberland, my Lord
Daves, and Sir Thomas Clyfford.

Item, certain discreet and grave persons to be appointed, to repair into
the parts of Germany, to practice and conclude some lege or amity with the
Princes and Potentates of Germany, that is to say, the King of Pole, John of
Hungary, the Duke of Saxony, the Duke of Bauyere, Duke Frederick, the
Landegraue Van Hesse, the Bishop of Magous, Bishop of Treuers, the Bishop of
Collene, and other the Potentates of Germany, and also to ensearch of what
inclination the said Princes and Potentates be of toward the King and this
realm.

Item, like practice to be made and practiced with the Cities of Lubeke,
Danske, Hambourgh, Bromeswicke, and all other the steads of the Haunse Tu^onyk;
and to ensearch of what inclination they be toward the King and this realm.

Item, like practice to be made and practiced with the Cities of Norimbourgh,
and Aughsbrough.

Item, to remember the Merchants adventurers, haunting the dominions of
Braband, and to speak with them.

Item, to set order and establishment of the Princes Dowagers house, with all
celeritie, and also of my Lady Maryes house.

To these (or some of these) purposes, the King dispatched messengers to all
his Ambassadors and Agents beyond seas, having before that sent the Duke of
Norfolk, Viscount Rocheford, Sir William Pawlet (afterward Marquess of
Winchester) and others, to the Pope, the Emperor, and the French King, being
all three together at Nice. He also caused his Secretary to write in this
manner to James the fifth, King of Scotland.

Most excellent, In predict. (...) bib. Cot.
mighty and victorious Prince, Ple^s^th your Magestie that by the commaundment
of my most dread Lord and Sovereign King of England, your graces most dear
Uncle, I have in charge, under commyssion, certain special matters concerning
his highness pleasure, secreatly to be signyfyed unto your grace, wherein not
only as a natural Cousyne of your royal consanguinity; but as a most loueing
Father entierly tendryng your worthy honor, no less desirous hereof, then
regardyng his own peculyer prosperyte, unfeignedly accomptyng your graces
advancement his most conformable consolacion. In consideracyon whereof since it
has so pleasyd God of his infynyte favor to revele unto his highness as well
by studyous endeavor of good letters, as by erudyte consultacyon of famous
estemyde Clerk; Also by long attempted experience, ensearchyng truyth chyeflye
in Christ's doctrine, who, says John the fourteenth, Ego sum veritas: now
clearly to perceive the thrall, captyvyte, under the vsurpyd power of the
Busshop of Rome, and his ungodly laws. Wherein his highness and other many of
his noble progenitors were most wyckedly abusyde, to their intolerable
calamity; and excedyng molestacion of their Subjects, over whom God had yeuon
them auctoryte and governance to rule, as by all stories of the old
testament, and informacyon of the new plainly apperith. Which groundly known
to his highness, wisshith likewise, the same to be persuadyd unto your grace;
whereby your honorable renoune and royal auctoryte should be much enlargyd,
with no less felycitye of soul, pryncipally to be regardyd, then with
abundant comoditie of riches, and unfeigned obeysaunce of faithful Subjects,
ferr from the comeberous calamyte of the Popysshe miserable molestacyon. What
more intolerable calamyte may there be to a Christian Prince, than unjustly to
be defeatyd of his righteous jurisdiction within his realm? to be a King by
name, and not indede, to be a ruler without regyment over his own liege
people? what more grievous molestacion can chance to true hearted Subjects, than
to be seuer^d from the alliegiaunce due to their natural Sovereign, there
annoyntyd King grauntyd by Gods laws, and to become servile slaves to a foreyn
Potentat, vsurpyng to reign over them against the law of God? as by the
violent tyranny of the Bushop of Rome has many years hitherto been practysed
throughout all regions, to the ruynous desolacyon of the hole Christentie? what
Realm is there but that the Bus^shop of Rome has planted therein his kingdom?
and established his regiment after soche a subtiell way, that he and his
cra^tye creatures were obeyed of Princes, to whom of duty they ought to have
been subject: 1. Pet. 2. sieve Regi tanquam praecellenti, etc. of whom all
Romayn Busshops have presumyd to be successors, but not folowers, contrary to
his example, Qui non venit ministrari, sed ministrare. In all Realms the
Popisshe practice has had soche confederacye of false forsworn factious and
traiterous Taleb^^rers.
Titinylks untrue to there Sovereign, that nothing was so secreatly in
counsel of any Prince, but forthwith it was carried by relacion to the Popes
care. And if ought were attemptyd against his own person, or any crookyd
creature of his creation, in restraynyng of there extortionate claymes (as there
was nothing but they claymed to have auctoryte upon) incontinent they bouncyd
out their thunderbolts, and currsyng fulminations, with soche intolerable
force of unmercifully crudelyte, that they made the greatiste personages of the
world to trymble and quake for fear. For by the negligente soufferaunce of
Princes, thrughe d^faute of knowledge of Gods word the Popisshe pride was so
haught, his auctoryte so preemynent, his power so puisaunte, his strength so
mighty, his displeasure so dangerous, his Tyrrannye so terrible; that scarce
any durst resist; to coutrevaill none was able. Example of many excellent
Princes; as John the furst, and Henry the second of gracyous memory, Kings of
England, here in their liffe times most cruelly vexyd, and after there
disseas, by forged leasyngs, and slanderous ympechements mysreportyd, and
faulselye belied, with dispitfull dishonor of there excellent progenye. After
like fasshion the victorious Emperor Lodovicus enterprysing to interrupte the
pestilente peruersyte of Pope John the two and twentieth, to what careful
confusion was he brought? Moreover the godly and well disposed Henry the third,
Emperor of Allmayn, how traytterouslye was he betrayed by Pope Hildebrande,
procuryng his own son unnaturally to war against his Father, to take him
prisoner, and finally to depose him of his Empereall crown? Furthermore, what
Christian heart can refrayn from sorrofull sighs, and morening lamentation to
considre how the Innocent and harmles Prince Childevicus King of France, was
extremely handelyd of his own servant Pepyne, beryved of his Kingdom through
the instigacion of the Busshop of Rome. And no marvaill though he ha^ thus
encroched upon Princes, being men; whereas he has exalted himself against God,
thrustyng him out of his room, and setlyng himself in Gods place, the
conscience of Christian people, of whose usurped power, S. Paul prophecyeng,
Thessall. 2. chap. 2. callyth him the sinful man, the son of perdicion, qui
est aduersarius and effertur adversus omne quod dicitur Deus, adeo vt in templo
Dei sedeat. Does not he sytt in the temple of God, by dampnable dispensacions,
by dysceyvable remyssions, by lyenge myrracles, by feigned relics, by false
religion, etc. And as he has avoided God out of the conscience of Christian
people, so has he defeated Princes of there jurisdictions, and debarred every
commen weal from there politic governance, bringyng in his lawless Canons,
and detestable decrees, supplantyng the devyne ordinance of power yeuen to
Pryncely rulers. And the cause why they have been so decey^ed, S. Paul
declaryth, Eo quod dilectionem veritatis non acceperunt. This legally
consideryd of your most prudent, singular, and high politic discretion,
as well by probable experience within your Domynyons, as by evident examples of
other Christian regions, where the Popisshe unruly regiment has reigned with
intolerable usurpation, tyrannouslye defacing all power of Princes.

It may please your gracious benygnytie to aduertice the entier intent, the
loving mind, and unfeigned heart of my Sovereign, your most dear uncle, so
fervently moved with a faithful love, unable to be expressed, to allure your
graces affection toward the favorable embracement of Gods word; wherein, his
highness only reioysinge, ardently desires to imparte the same, his special
joy, with your most excellent grace, which should be greatly thadvauncement of
your estate royal, the quietacion of your loving Subjects, and most highly
the pleasure of God.

Now to make the Pope more odious, his Kingly power, and deliberate
proceedings in these his weighty causes of greater validity, and more
warrantable, as well by the laws of God, as general Counsels; he caused to
be pend, and published abroad, here, and beyond seas, to the same effect in
these words.

If mortal creatures to their hedds, Ex eod. M^ss. in bib. Cot.
sovereigns, and naturell Princes, be cheeflye bound next unto God, specially
where they as most careful fathers and Tutors, prudently and sagely rule and
govern the great numbers and multitudes of men, committed to their obedyence;
And where they in their royal persons often forgetting the regard of their
Princely magesties, valyantly withstand, abide and resist, whatsoever troubles,
dangers, perells, assawts, wrongs, iniuryes, or displeasures might at any time
happen, chance, threten, or be incident unto their people, or countries,
besyds many and innumerable other displeasures and troubles, which daily and
heurely for the defense mayntenaunce and supportacion of their realms, people
and cuntryes, secretly happen, and chance them, their people seldom, or at no
time pryvey thereunto; whereby of good congruence, all Subjects become most
bounden to their sovereigns and Princes, and them ought most feithfully to
love, honor, obey, serve and dread, and their magesties to mayntayn,
support, and defend with all their power, might, strength, and ability. Then
let no Englyssheman forgett the most noble and loving Prince of this realm,
who for the godly ensample of his people, the love and dread he has to God,
and observance of his most reverend laws, has to the evydent knowledge of all
his welbelouyd Subjects long endured and abyden, to his inestimable cost,
charge, trouble, vexation, and inquye^nes, Which was the diu^rce betwixt him
and his wife Katherine.
the trial of his great cause: And at last after innumerable most famous
learned men's judgments on his side therein given. Yet for all that most
wrongfully judged by the great Idol and most cruel enymye to Christ's law and
his religion, which calls himself Pope, And his most just and lawful
prouocacion and appellacion from the said enemy of Christ's law to the general
counsel made, also refused, denied, and forsaken; Wherefore and to thintente
all men may know the abominable wrongs, which our most noble and gracious
Prince does sustain by so unlawful intreatyngs, Therefore are these few
articles hereafter following presented unto those, that shall both desire to
know the truth, and in truth shall thyrste and covet feythfully to assyst,
maynteyn, supporte, defend, and stand by their Prince and Souerayn, in his
most just, lawful, and right wise cause.

First that the general Counsel lawfully gathered is and ought to be
superior to all Jurisdictions, either usurped and suffered (as the Papal) or
justly holden as kings in all matters concerning the feythe and direction of
the whole Church of Christ. And also ought to be judged thereby, and by the
decrees of the same only, and by none other, they being consonant to the law of
Christ.

Secondly, that Princes have two ways principally; when none other can
prevayle to attain right the one against the other; that is to say, in cawses
concerning the soul being mere spirituell, appellacion to the general
counsel In temporal cawses the sword only, except by mediation of friends the
matters may be compounded; So that whosoever would go about to take away these
naturell defenses from Princes, is to be manly withstood, both by the Princes
and their Subjects. And thereto all Christien men should be anymated by the words
of our Lord Jesus Christ, which are, Obey ye Princes above all; and then their
deputyes or mynysters, not gevyng power to forreyns within their rules and
domynyons.

Thirdly, that diverse general Counsaills have determined, that cawses of
strife or controversy being ones begone in any Regyon, shall there, and in
the said Regyon be finally determined, and not elsewhere. Upon which ground
the Kings highness, his nobles, both spirituell and temporal, and Commons by
one hole consent, upon diverse most prudent, wise, and polytike reasons, and
weyghty consideracions, agreeable to the said general Counsaills, have made a
Law, by the which good people, lyving within the lymets of true and lawful
matrymonye, shall not by malice or evil will be so long deteyned and
interrupted from their right, as in times passyd they have been. Neither
unlawful matrymonye shall have his iniust and incestuous demoure and
contynuance, as by delays to Rome it was wont to have; Which now may evydently
appear, by that, that our Princes weyghtye and long protracted cause of
matrymonye has his final and prosperous end, according to the laws of God,
with brief success of Issue already had, and other like to follow, lawdes be
to God, thonly werker of the same.

Forthely, that our said Prince and Sovereign, according to the liberty and
laws of Nature, and constitucions of general Counsaills (as before) has both
provoked and appeled from the most iniust and unlawful sentence wrongfully
given against him, by the Bushop of Rome, to the general Counsel next
ensying, and lawfully congregate, that is to say, from the sentence of the
usurper of Gods laws, and infringer of general Counsels, which callyth
himself Pope. In the which our said Princes doyings, all just and true
Christien men, specially his most loving Subjects I doubt not will supporte and
maynteyne him: Which prouocacions and appellacions also standing in force, and
being intimate to the person of the said Usurper (as indede they be) and by him
denyde and refused, sequestreth him rightfully from all manner of Processes
belongyng, or in any wise apperteynyng to the said fact or matter; other
Diabolike acts and statuts by some of his predecessors to the contrary made
notwithstanding. Wherefore what censures, interdictions, or other his cursed
invencions so ever they be, fulminate or set forth by the said usurper, the
same ought not only to be abhorred and despised, but manfully to be withstood
and defended. And who so done shall have for their bukler the latter and better
part of this verse ensuyng, and the maligners the forparte, which is, Quoniam
qui malignant exterminabuntur, sustinentes autem Domini ipsi heredita^unt
terram.

Fyftely, that where indede by holy Scripture and Christ's law, there is none
authoryte nor Jurisdiction granted more to the Bushop of Rome, then to any
other Bushop, extra Prouinciam, yet because that sufferaunce of people, and
blyndnes of Princes with their supportacion hitherto has sustained the same,
doing themselffs thereby to great iniurye and wrong; It is now thought therefore
not only conuenyent, but also much more then necessary, to open the same unto
the people, to thyntent they should from henceforth no longer be disteyned in
honoring him as an Idol; which is but a man vsurpyng Gods power and
auctoryte: And a man neither in life, learning, or conversation like Christ's
minister or disciple: yea a man also (though the Sea Apostolic were never of
so high auctoryte) unworthy and unlawful by their owen decrees and laws to
occupye and enjoy that usurped place. For first he is both base, and also come
to that dygnytie by Symonye. And now by denying the Kings lawful prouocacion
and appele, and in supportyng that Diabolike decree of his predecessor Pius, is
determined by a general Counsel a very Heretic. Wherefore all true Christien
people (except he amend) ought to despise both him and all his facts, and be no
longer blinded by him; but give themselffs entierly to the obseruaunce of
Christ's laws, in which is all swetenes and truth; and in the other nothing
else but pomp, pride, ambycion, and ways to make himself rich: which is
much contrarious to their profession. Our Lord amend them.

Likewise such was the wisdom of the King and his Council, that the best
scholars of the kingdom, as well verst in history humane, as in the story
of sacred Writ, were appointed to collect out of holy Scripture, Catholic
Authors, and general Counsels, such material points, as might annihilate
the Popes power and authority, confirm his Majesty's Supremacy; and delineate
and set forth the manifold abuses found to be practiced by the Popish Clergy.
Which they divided into certain membranes, containing these heads following.

These Heads or Chapters are all succinctly handled, glossed upon, and
illustrated by diverse examples, which are too long (though perhaps they would
not seem tedious) for this my present discourse; I will only then insist upon
the last, the foundation I mean of Saint Albans, by Ossa King of the Mercians;
for that by this Donation, the Supremacy of Kings is very apparent; and also
that once for all I may by this one, show my Reader the form of all those
Cartularies, by which such devout Saxon Princes endowed their sacred Structures.

It was generally conceived (and truly as I think) that these politic ways
for the taking away from the Pope his unlimited authority here in England, as
also in the suppression of religious houses (of which in the next Chapter) were
principally devised by Secretary Cromwell, afterward Earl of Essex, which
may appear both by the premises and sequel of this my discourse, as also by
the intimation of Nicholas Shaxton Bishop of Sarum, in a letter sent unto him
the said Cromwell, thus worded.

Honorable sir
I certify your good mastership that I have this day received the King his
most honorable letters sent unto me from you by my servant, Ex eod. lib. in
bib. Cottoniana.
And rejoice not a little that itt has pleased his highness to write so
ernestly unto the Bishopps in this so ernest a cause, thynkyng suyrly that God
has used your wisdom to stire up the good Prince hereunto, whereof I heighli
thank the almighti Lord; preyeng you also to goo on still from one thing to
another, as your wisdom, yea Gods very wisdom in you exciteth and serves you,
till the usurped pour of that man of Rome be clean abolished; and put out of
the hearts of the kings subjects. And I shall with all my diligence apply my
self to thaccomplishment of this his so godly commandment by Gods grace. And
for as much as I have taken my leave of the King and Queen, and tarry for
noothing now but only for the instrument called Custodias temporalium. I

But howsoever the honor of this act, as also of the dissolution of Abbeys be
principally attributed to Cromwell and his complotments; yet at the same time
there was others of the privy Council, as forward, and as able for their
singular endowments, to conclude a matter of that consequence as ever was
Cromwell. I mean Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, whose zeal and
abilities are generally known to all that ever heard of the book of Martyrs.
Sir Thomas Audley Knight, speaker of the Parliament, for his demerits created
by Henry the eighth, Baron Audley of Walden, and also advanced to the honor of
the Chancellorship of England. Sir William Pawlet Knight, Comptroller of the
Kings house, who, for his wisdom, the said King created Lord S. John of
Basing, and Knight of the Garter, whom Edward the sixth made great Master of his
household, President of his Council, and Lord Treasurer of England; whom he
created Earl of Wiltshire, and Marquess of Winchester; to whom Queen
Elizabeth committed the keeping of the great Seal. Who lived to see one
hundred and three persons issue out of his loins, who died at Basing in
Hampshire the tenth of March, 1571. where he was honorably buried, when he
had lived eighty seven years. Another pillar of the State at that time, was
that wise and judicious gentleman* Sir Richard Rich, Lord Chancellor of
England, under King Edward the sixth, who in the first year of his reign,
advanced him to this office, and created him Baron Rich of Leez in Essex. These
and other more of the Nobility had both their hands and heads in this
business, yet Cromwell, Audley, and Rich, were thought to be the only men;
who, for their religious pains, ran into great obloquie with the common
people; insomuch that the Commons of Lincolnshire finding themselves fore
troubled with this strange alteration, and rising in rebellion, presented
diverse articles of aggrieuances to the Kings Majesty*

Amongst the said Articles and demands of Robert Ask^, and his rebellious crew,
the Commons of Yorkshire, Cumberland, Westmerland, Northumberland, and the
countries adjacent* at the conference holden at Doncaster, betwixt Thomas Duke
of Norfolk, General of the Kings Army, and certain Commissioners on the
party of the said Captain Ask, and his fellow rebels. Thus it was propounded
by their Speaker, Sir Thomas Hylton Knight.

The fowrt that Thomas Cromwell, nor any of his band or sect, be not at our
metinge at Doncastre, but abcent themself from the Council.

Also to have the Lord Cromwell, the Lord Chancellor, and Sir Ryc. Rich to have
condign punishment, as subuerters of the good laws of the ^eame, and ouetemers
of the slese sect of theys falls Heretykes, first inuenters and brengers of
them.

Likewise Doctor Leyton, and Doctor Le^, who had been loyned in commission with
Cromwell for the visitation of religious Foundations (of which hereafter) were
maliciouslye detracted, by this demand of the Commons in the foresaid
conference.

Also that Doctor Lee, and Doctor Leyton, may have condign punishment for
their extortions, in time of visitation, in brybes, of some religyous houses,
x. lib. xx. lib. and for other sums, beside horsys, vowsens, leases, under
Covent Seallys, by them taken, and other abomynable acts by them committed and
done.

I might have occasion here to speak of the abrogation of the Popes
authority, of the subversion of religious foundations, of the suppression of
religious Votaries, and of the reformation of Religion in that neuer-conquered
Nation of Scotland, where, at this time, Religion is double refined, pure and
spotless without ceremony, and plain as a pike staff without a surplise.
But I will reserve this narration till I come to speak of the conversion of
Scotland to the Christian faith. As also of the Funeral Monuments which are
there to be found, which will be but a few, if Sir Robert Cottons Library do
not help me, for by my own observation, in the famous maiden-citie of
Edenborough, and in the Parish Churches of other Towns, the Sepulchers of the
dead are shamefully abused, or quite taken away, yea and the Churches
themselves, with religious houses, and other holy places, violated, demolished,
or defaced.

CHAP. XV. The policy used by the King and his Council for the dissolution
and extirpation of Religious Foundations, and Religious Orders, within this
Realm of England and Wales. The reformation of Religion. of Inscriptions in
Churches. The Kings warrant of the surrender of Religious Houses. An
information made to Queen Elizabeth of the several abuses done unto the State
general, and Crown, by the corruption of such as were employed by her Father
upon the suppression of Abbeyes.
HEnry the eighth having (as ye have heard) thus settled the Supremacy where he
would have it, either by the advice of politic Cromwell, or by the example of
proud Wolsey, or else of himself (he being nothing so scrupulous in
conscience, nor so stayed in sacred resolutions as was Henry the fourth) upon a
greedy desire to enrich his coffers, began now to lay plots, devises, and
proiects for the utter subversion of all Abbeyes, Priories, Nunneries, and
other religious foundations; within this his kingdom of England and Wales: and
first for an induction to the business, He put in Commission his servant
Cromwell, Thomas Lee, and Richard Laiton, Doctors of the Civil Law, Thomas
Bedell, Deane of Cornwall, Thomas Bartlet public Notarie, and others, to visit
all the foresaid religious Houses, and to make inquiry of their Orders,
Founders, values, debenters, relics, pilgrimages, and other Queres: but most
especially they were to make diligent scrutinie, and to learn, vijs and modis
omnibus, by all manner of means the wicked abuses of those times, practiced
amongst the Fraternity, and Sisterhood of each several Covent. Which with
their Commission they returned; making a shameful discoueri^ of the bestiall
sensuality of Monasticke profession.

This general visitation began in the month of October, and in February next
following, a Parliament upon prorogation was holden at Westminster, in which
these unspeakable crimes of all the Couents were certified by the Commissioners
to the King, and that high Court. Upon the reading whereof, because their
offenses were found to be many and odious, or that King Henry would have it so
(which I rather believe) it was enacted by both houses in that present
Parliament, Stat. in 27. Hen. 8. ca. 28.
that all religious houses of and under the yearly value of two hundred pound,
within the whole Realm of England and Wales, should be given and granted to
the King and his heirs for ever: with all and singular the lands, tenements,
rents, reuersions, goods, cattels, debts, ornaments and jewels, with all things
else thereunto, or to their Orders, in any wise appertaining or belonging.

The number of these houses then suppressed, were three hundred seventy six.
The value of their lands, yearly as then easily rated, was twenty nine
thousand forty one pounds three pence half penie qua: others, for thirty
two thousand pound, ^
and more, the moveable goods as they were sold, Robin Hoods peniworths,
amounted to more then one hundred thousand pounds, the religious persons that
were put out of the same houses, were in number above ten thousand.

It was a pitiful thing to here the lamentation that the people in the
country made for them, for there was great hospitality kept among them, and
as it was thought more then ten thousand persons, masters, and servants, had
lost their livings, by the putting down of those houses at that time.

Before the dissolution of these religious houses, the plot was laid for the
suppression of the rest. For first of all, for an introduction to that which
followed, Cromwell and the rest of the Visiters, in their visitations, put
forth of their Couents all religious persons, that desired to be eased of the
burdenous yoke of their profession, to whom the Abbot or Prior was to give to
such so departed for their habit, a Priests gown, and forty shillings of
money. The Nuns to have such apparel as secular women wore, and to go
whither they would. They put forth likewise all religious persons that were
under the age of four and twenty years, and afterward closed up the residue
that would remain, so, that they could not come out of their places; and took
order that no man should come to the houses of women, nor women to the houses
of men, but only to hear their service in the Church. This little bondage,
after so long and so licentious a time of liberty, could not be endured; which
being perceived by the Commissioners, with fair promises of other preferments,
or competent yearly pensions, they so wrought with the Abbots, Priors, and
Prioresses, and the rest of the Couents, that diverse of them surrendered up
their houses with the appurtenances into the Kings hands, before the sitting of
this Parliament, as by these words in the foresaid Act does plainly appear.

And also be it enacted, that his Highness shall have to him and his heirs all
and singular such Monasteries, Abbeys, and Priories, which at any time within
on year next before the making of this Act, has been given and granted, by
any Abbot, Prior, Abbess, or Prioresse, under their Covent Seal, or that
otherwise has been suppressed or dissolved, and all and sin^gular the lands,
tenements, goods, etc. interests and hereditaments, etc. to the same
appertaining and belonging.

Now (by the example of these, or by what other means I know not) the rest of
the Abbots, Priors, Abbesses, and Prioresses, at other times, with unanimous
consent of their Couents, in great compunction of spirit, contrition of heart,
and confession of their manifold enormities, did severally give and grant to
the Kings Majesty, and to his heirs, all their right and interest which they
had in their Monasteries, lands, goods, or hereditaments; by certain
instruments or writings under their hands and S^ales, of which I will set down
one or two for example, which I had from my loving friend, Master John Masters,
Master of the Augmentation Office; in form as follows.

But first will it please you read the copy of the Kings Warrant, to such his
Commissioners as were to take the Surrenders of Religious houses. The form of
which thus follows.

Henry the eighth, etc.
To our trusty, etc.
Forasmuch as we understand that the Monastery of S. A. is at this present in
such state, as the same is neither used to the glory of God, nor to the
benefyte of our Common wealth, We let you wit, that therefore being minded to take
the same into our own hands for a better purpose; like as we doubt not but the
head of the same will be contented to make his surrender accordingly, we for the
spesyall trust and confydence that we have in your fydellity, wisdoms and
discrecions, have, and by these presents, do authoryse, name, assygne, and

the said Head such a writing under the Covent Seal, as to your discretyons
shall seem requisite, meet, and convenient, for the due surrender to our use
of the same, and thereupon take pos^sessyon thereof, and of all the goods
cattelles plate, fuel^es, implements and stuff, being within, or apperteyneng
thereunto. And forther causyng all the goods and implements to be indisterently
sold, either for reddy money, or at days upon suffyciente suertyes; so that

and Brethren, such part of the said money and goods, as ye by your
discresyons shall think meet and conuenyente for their despeche. And forther
to see them have convenyente pensyons, by your wysdomes assigned accordyngly:
which done, and moreover seeing the rightful and due debts thereof paid and
satysfyed, as well of the revenewes as of the said stuff, as to reason and
good ^onscyens apperteyneth, and your charges reasonably allowed, ye shall
proceed to the dissolutyon of the said house: And forther in your name take
possessyon of the same to be kept to our use and profit. Ye shall furthermore
bring and convaye to owr Tower of London after yowr said discressyons all the
rest of the said money, Plate, Iuelles, and ornaments that in any wise shall
come to your hands by mean of the premysses, or of any part thereof. Straitely
charging and commandynge all Maires, Sheryffes, Bayli^^^s, Constables, and all
other our Officers, Ministers, and Subjects, to whom in this case it shall
apperteyne, that unto you, and every of you in exe^ution hereof, they be
helpinge, aydinge, savoring, and assisting, as they will answer unto us to the
contrary at their vttermoste perrilles.

Yeuen, etc.
The resignation or surrender of the Prior and Covent of Saint Andrews,
Northampton: with a recognition of their manifold enormities.
^
Most noble and virtuous Prince, owr most rightuous and gracyous Soueraign
Lord, and undoubted Founder, and in earth next under God Supreme heed of this
English Church. We yowr Gracys pore and most unworthy Subjects, Francys,
Priour of yowr Graces Monastery of Saint Andrew the Apostle, within yowr Graces
Town of Northampton, and the hoole Covent of the same, being steryd by the
gryffe of owr conscience, unto great contricion for the manifold negligence,
enormytes, and abuses, of long time by us and other owr predecessors, under
the pretense and shadow of perfyght Religion, vsyd and comytted, to the grievous
displeasure of Almighty God, the craftye decepcion, and subtell seduccion of
the pure and simple myndys of the good Christian people of this yowr noble
Reame, knowlegen owr selffes to have grievously offendyd God, and yowr Highness
owr Soueraign Lord and Founder. As Well in corrupting the conscience of yowr
good Christian subjects, with vain, superstitious, and other unprofitable
ceremonies, the very means and plain induccions to the abominable sin of
Idolatry; as in omyttyng the execucion of such deuowte and due observaunces,
and charitable acts as we were boun^den to do, by the promises, and avowe made
by us and our predecessors, unto Almighty God, and to yowr graces most noble
progeni^ors, orygynall Founders of yowr said Monastery. For the which
obseruances, and dedys of charity, only yowr said Monastery was endowed with
son^ry possessions, Jewels, ornaments, and other goods, moveable and
immovable, by yowr graces said noble progenitors. The revenues of which
possessions, we the said Priour and Covent, voluntaryly only by owr pr^pre
conscience compellyd, do recognyce, neither by us, nor owr predecessors to have been employed according to the origynall intent of the Founders, of yowr said
Monastery; that is to say, in the pure observaunce of Chrysts Religion,
according to the devowte rule, and doctrine, of holy Saint Benedict, in
vertuose exercise, and study, according to owr professyon and avowe; ne yett in
the charytable sustayning, comforting, and releiving of the pore people, by the
keeping of good and necessary hospitality. But as well we as others owr
predecessors, called religiouse persons within yowr said Monastery, taking on
us the habit or owtewarde vesture of the said rule, only to the intent to
lead owr liffes in an ydell quyetnes, and not in vertuose exercise, in a
stately estymacion, and not in obedient humylyte, have under the shadow, or
color of the said Rule and habit, vaynly, detestably, and also ungodly,
employed, yea rather deuowred, the yearly revenues yssuing and coming of the
said possessions, in contynuall ingurgitacions and farcyngs of owr carayne
bodies, and of others, the support^res of owr voluptuose and carnal appetyte,
with other vain and ungodly expensys; to the manifest subvertion of devotion,
and clennes of lyvyng; and to the most notable slander of Chrysts holy
Euangely, which in the form of owr professyon, we did ostentate, and openly
advaunte to keep most exactly: withdrawing thereby from the simple, and pure
myndys of yowr graces subjects, the only truth and comfort, which they ought
to have by the true faith of Christ. And also the devyne honor, and glory,
only due to the glorious Majesty of God Almighty, steryng them with all
persuasions, ingynes, and polyce, to dedd Images, and counterfett relics, for
owr dampnable lucre. Which our most horrible abhominacions, and execrable
persuacions of yowr graces people, to detestable errors, and our long coueryd
Ipocrysie cloked with feigned sanctite; We revolving daily, and continually
ponderyng in owr sorrowful hearts, and thereby perseyuing the botomlas gulf of
everlasting fire ready to devowre us, if persysting in this state of lyvyng, we
should depart from this uncertain and transytory liffe; constrained, by the
intolerable anguysh of owr conscience, called as we trust by the grace of God,
who would have no man to perysh in sin: with hearts most contrite, and
repentante, prostrate at the noble feet of yowr most royal Majesty, most
lamentably do crave of yowr highness, of yowr habundant mercy, to grant unto
us, most grievous against God, and yowr highness, yowr most gracious perdon, for
owr said sundry offenses, omyssyons, and negligences, comytted as before by us
is confessyd, against yowr hyghnes, and yowr most noble progenitors. And where
yowr hyghnes, being supreme hedd, immediately next aftre Christ, of his
Church, in this yowr Roialme of England, so consequently general and only
reformator of all religious persons, there, have full authority to correct or
dyssolue at your graces pleasure, and liberty, all Couents and Relygious
companyes abusyng the Rewles of their profession. And moreover to yowr highness,
being owr soueraygn Lord, and undoubted founder of yowr said Monastery, by
dissolucion whereof apperteyneth only the oryginall title, and propre
inherytance, as well of all other goods moveable and immovable, to the said
Monastery in any wise apperteyning or belonging, to be dissposed, and employed,
as to yowr graces most excellent wisdom shall seem expedyent and necessary.
All which possessions, and goods, yowr highness for our said offenses, abuses
omyssyons, and neglygences, being to all men obedyent, and by us plainly
confessed, now has, and of long time past has hadd, just and lafull cawse, to
resume into yowr graces hands and possessyon, at yowr graces pleasure. The
resumption whereof, yowr highness nevertheless, lick a most natural loving
Prince, and clement governor, over us yowr graces po^e, and for owr offenses,
most unworthy subjects, has of long season differred, and yet does, in hope
and trust of owr voluntary reconciliacion and amendment, by yowr graces
manyfolde, loving, and gentle admonyshments, showed unto us by diverse and
sundry meanys. We therefore consyderyng with owr selffes your graces exceedyng
goodness and mercy, extended at all times unto us, most miserable trespassers
against God and yowr hyghnes; For a perfight declaracion of yowr unfeigned
contricion and repentance, felyng owr selffes very week, and unable to observe
and perform owr aforesaid avowes and promyses, made by us and owr
predecessors, to God, and yowr graces noble progenitors; and to employ the
possessions of yowr said Monastery, according to the first will and intent of
the oryginall Founders. And to the intent that yowr highness, yowr noble heirs
and successors, with the true Christian people, of this yowr graces Roialme of
England, be not from hensforth estsones abused with such feyned devotion, and
deyllysh persuasions, under the pretext and habyte of Relygion, by us or any
other, which should happen to bear the name of Relygyous within yowr said
Monastery. And moreover, that the said possessions and goods should be no
longer restreyned, from a bettyr or more necessary employment. Most humble
beseechen yowr highness, owr most gracyous soueraign Lord and Founder, that it
might lick yowr Majesty, for the discharging and exoncrating us, of the most
grievous bourden of owr payned conscience, to the immynent parell and danger of
owr dampnacion, that we should be in, if by persisting in the state that we now
rest in, we should be the let of a more godly and necessary employment:
graciously to accept owr free gifts withought coercion, persuasion, or
procurement, of any creature living, other then of owr voluntary free will, of
all such possessions, right, title, or interest, as we the said Prior and
Covent has or euyr hadd, or ar supposed to have had, in or to your said
Monastery of Northampton aforesaid. And all and every parcel of the lands,
advousons, comodytes, and other revenues, whatsoeuyr they ben belonging to the
same And all manner of goods, Jewels, ornaments, wi^h all other manner of
cattals, moveable and immovable, to the said Monastery in any wise
apperteyning or belonging, into whoes hands or possession to euyr they ben
come into, to be employed, and disposed, is to your graces most excellent
wisdom shall seem expedy^nt and necessary. And although, most gra^cious
soueraign Lord, that the thing by us g^ven unto your highness, is properly and
of right ought to be yowr graces own, as well by the meryt, of our offenses,
as by the order of our graces laws; Yet notwythstan^dyng we eftsoon most
humble beseechen yowr highness, graciously and benevolently to accept owr free
will, with the gift thereof, nothing requyring of yowr Majesty therefore, other
then your most gracious perdon, with some piece of yowr graces alms, and
habundant charity toward the mayntenance of owr pore lyving, and license
hensforth to live in such form in correcting the rest of our liffes, as we
hope to make satysfaccion thereby to God, and yowr highness: for owr hypocrasie,
and other owr grievous offenses by us committed, as well again his Di^te, as
your Majesty. And for the more infallyble proffe that this our recognycion unto
yowr highness, is only the mere and voluntary Act of us the said Priour and
Covent aforesaid, withought any compulcion, or inducement, other then of owr
propre conscience, we have not only publyshed the same, openly in the presence
of your graces true and faithful subjects, and servants, Sir Wylliam Apparre,
Knight, Richard Layton, Doitor in the Laws, Arche^deacon of Buckingham, and
Roberd Southwell, Atturnay for the Augmentacions of yowr graces most noble
Crown yowr graces Commyssyoners here, with diverse other that were present at
that time. And under this owr present Recognicion Sealed with our Covent Seal,
subscrybed owr own names; but also have made sealed with owr Covent Seal, and
delivered to the said Roberd Sowthwell to yowr highness use, a sufficient and

The Surrender of the Warden and Friars of S. Francis in Stanford.
For as much as we, the Warden, and Freers, of the house of Saint Frances in
Stannforde, comenly called the gray Freers in Stannford, in the County of
Lincoln, do profoundly concider that the perfeccion of Christian living does
not conciste in dome ceremonies, weryng of a gray cootte, disgeasing our selffe
aftyr strange fassions, dokyng, and beckyng, in gurdyng owr selffes with a
gurdle full of knots, and other like Papisticall ceremonies, wherein we have been
most principally practysed, and misselyd in times past; but the very true way
to please God, and to live a true Christian man, with owte all ypocrasie, and
feigned dissimulacion, is sinceerly declared unto us by owr Master Christ, his
Evangelists, and Apostoles. Being mindyd herafter to follow the same;
conformyng owr selffe unto the will and pleasure of owr supreme hedde under God
in earth the Kings Majesty; and not to follow hensforth the supersticious
tradicions of of any forincycall potentate, or poor, with mutual assent, and
consent, do submytt owr selffes unto the mercy of owr said soueraygn Lord.
And with like mutual assent and consent, do surrender, and yield vpe unto,
the hands of the same, all owr said house of Saint Frances in Stannforde
comenly called the gray Friars in Stannforde, with all lands, tenements,
gardens, meadows, waters, pondyards, fedyngs, pastures, comens, rentes,
reuersions, and all other our interest, ryghtes, or titles, aperteynyng unto
the same: most humbly besechyng his most noble grace, to disspose of us,
and of the same as best schall stand with his most graciouse pleasure. And
farther freely to grant unto every on of us his licens under wretynge and Seall,
to change our abites into seculer fassion, and to receve such manner of
livyngs, as other seculer Pristes comenly be preferryd unto. And we all
faithfully schall prey unto allmyghty god long to preserve his most noble
grace, with increase of much felicity and honor.

And in witness of all and singular the premysses, we the said Warden, and
Covent of the gray Freers in Stannforde, to these presents have put owr
Covent Sceall the yeght day of Octobre, in the thirty the year of the raygn of
owr most Sovereign King Henry the yeght. Factum Iohannis Schemy Guardian: Per
me Fratrem Iohannem Robards. Per me Fratrem Iohannem Chadwhort. Per me Fratrem

With the like petition and recognition of their several delinquencies, the
Prior and Covent of the White Friars Carmelites in Stanford, the ^bbo^ and
Covent of our blessed Lady of Bidlesden, the Warden and brethren of the gray
Friars of Couentrie, Bedford, and Alesbury, surrendered up them houses into the
kings hands.

Battle Abbey in Sussex, Martine Abbey in Surrey, Stra^ford Abbey in Essex,
Lewis in Suffex, Saint Austines in Canterbury, the new Abbey at the Tower hill,
the Minories without Aldgate, the Nunnery at Clerken well: The Hospital of
Saint Thomas Akers, the Blacke-Friers, the White-Friers, the gray Friars, and
the Charterhouse Monks in London, with the most, or all other, were surrendered
after the same manner.

In September the same year. Viz. An. 30. Hen. 8. by the special motion of
great Cromwell, all the notable images, unto the which were made any especial
pilgrimages, and offerings, as the images of our Lady of Walsingham, Ipswich,
Worcester, the Lady of Wilsdon; the rood of Grace, of our Lady of Boxley, and
the image of the rood of Saint Savior at Bermondsey, with all the rest, were
brought up to London, and burnt at Chelsey, at the commandment of the foresaid
Cromwell, all the Jewels, and other rich offerings, to these, and to the
Shrines, (which were all likewise taken away or beaten to pieces) of other
Saints throughout both England and Wales, were brought into the Kings Treasury.

In the same year also the Abbey of Westminster was surrendered, being valued
to dispend by the year three thousand four hundred and seventy pound, or by
some 3977. l. 6. s. 4. d. ob. q. as in the Catalogue of religious houses; the
Monks being expelled, King Henry placed therein a Deane and Prebendaries, and
made the last Abbot, whose name was Benson, the first Deane; in the time of
Edward the sixth it was made a Bishops See, shortly after (the benefits of the
Church being abridged) it came again to a Deane and Prebends; Again Queen
Marie ordained there an Abbot and his Monks, who continued not many years,
but were again cut off by Act of Parliament. And lastly Queen Elizabeth (that
wonder of the world) made it a collegiate Church, or rather a Nursery for the
Church, says Norden, for there she ordained (to the glory of God, the
propagation of true Religion and good literature) a Deane, twelve Prebendaries,
an upper master, and an Usher for the School, forty Scholars, called the
Queens or Kings Scholars, who (as they become worthy) are preferred to the
Universities, besides Ministers, Singers, and Organists; ten Quiristers, and
twelve well deserving Soldiers. Thus you see the interchangeable vicissitude
of her foundation, and if it had not been for the reverend regard they had of
the Sepulchers, inauguration and unction here of their famous Ancestors, these
forenamed Kings (if I may ground my reason upon the passages of those times)
had taken her commings in, to have inrich^ their own coffers, despoiled her o^
her invaluable wealth and ornaments, and battered down to the ground her
sacred Ed^fice.

The fifth of December ^n the soresaid year, the Abbey of Saint Alba^s was
surrendered, by the Abbot and Monks there, by delivering the Covent Seal into
the hands of Tho. Pope, D. Peter, Master Canendish, and others the Kings
visiters.

(...) 13.
Now all, or the most of all, the religious houses in England and Wales, being
thus surrendered, the King summoned another Parliament at West^minster; for
howsoever these forenamed religious orders, and other more, of their own free
and voluntary minds, good wills, and assents, without constra^^t ^oact^on or
compulsion (as are the words in the Statute) of any manner of person or
persons, by due order of law, and by their sufficient writings of Record, under
their Covent, and common Seals; had already g^uen, granted, and confirmed,
renounced, left, and forsaken, all their religious h^u^^s, with their lands,
and all other the appurtenances to the same belonging^ unto the King his heirs
and successors for ever. Yet it was thought necessary by the King and his
Council, that these their ^o u^ta^ic donations should be further ratified by
authority of that high (...) whereupon it was enacted, that all Monasteries,
with their Scites, circuits and precincts; lands, Lordships, and all other
franchises, not only those which were surrendered or dissolved, before the
session of this Parliament, but also such as were to be surrendered or
dissolved hereafter, should be vested, deemed, and adjudged to be in the very
actual and real season, and possession of the King his heirs and successors
for ever.

The religious Order of Saint John's of Jerusalem, whose chief mansion house
was in the precincts of Clerkenwell Parish, within the Country of Middlesex,
consisting of gentlemen and soldiers, of ancient families and high spirits,
could by no means be brought in, to present to his Majesty any of these puling
petitions, and public recognitions of their errors, thereby, like the rest, to
give a loaf, and beg a shiue, to turn themselves out of actual possession,
and lie at the Kings mercy for some poor yearly pension. But like sto^^^
fellows stood out against any that thought to enrich themselves with their
ample revenues, until they were cast out of their glorious structures, and all
other their estates, for these causes following alleged a^gainst them in open
Parliament; as appears by the statute beginning thus.

(...) 2. (...)
The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons of this present Parliament
assembled, having credible knowledge, that diverse and sundry the kings
subjects, called the Knights of the Rhodes, otherwise called Knights of Saint
John's; otherwise called Friars of the religion of S. John of Jerusalem in
England, and of a like house being in Ireland, abiding in the parties of beyond
the sea, and having as well out of this Realm, as out of Ireland, and other the
Kings dominions, yearly great sums of money for maintenance of their
livings, Have unnaturally, and contrary to the duty of their alleageances
sustained, and maintained, (...) power and authority of the Bishop of Rome,
lately used and (...) within this Realm, and other the Kings dominions, and
have not only adhered themselves to the said Bishop, being common enemy to the
King our sovereign Lord, and to this his Realm, untruly upholding,
knowledging, and affirming maliciously and traitorously, the same Bishop to be
supreme, and chief head of Christ's Church, by Gods holy word. Entending
thereby to subvert and overthrow the good and godly laws and statutes of this
realm, for the abolishing, expulsing, and utter extincting of the said usurped
power and authority: but also have defamed and slandered as well the Kings
Majesty, as the Noblemen, Prelates, and other the Kings true and loving
subjects of this Realm, for their good and godly proceeding in that behalf.

Upon these causes and other considerations, it was enacted, That the
Corporation of the said Religion, as well within this Realm, as within the
Kings dominion, and Land of Ireland, should be utterly dissolved, and void to
all entents and purposes. And that Sir William Weston Knight, as then Prior, of
the said Religion, of this Realm of England, should not be named or called
from henceforth, Prior of Saint John's of Jerusalem in England, but by his
proper name of William Weston Knight, without further addition touching the
said Religion. And that likewise Sir John Rauson knight, being then Prior of
Kilmainam in Ireland, should not be called or named from thenceforth, Prior of
Kilmainam in Ireland, but only by his proper name of John Rauson, knight,
without farther addition. And that none of the Brethren or Confriers of the
said Religion within this Realm of England, and Land of Ireland, should be
called Knights of the Rhodes, or knights of Saint John's, but by their own
proper Christian names, and surnames of their parents without any other
additions.

And furthermore it was enacted under a great penalty, that they should not
wear about their necks, in, or upon any apparel of their bodies, any chain
with a Jerusalem Cross, or any other sign mark, or token thereto^fore used,
and devised, for the knowledge of the said Religion, and that they should not
make any congregations, chapiters, or assemblies touching the same Religion, or
maintain, support, use, or defend any liberties* franchises, or privileges,
theretofore granted to the said Religion, by the authority of the Bishop of
Rome, or of the Sea of the same.

Lastly, it was granted by the authority of the said Parliament, that the
Kings Majesty, his heirs and successors, should have and enjoy their said
mansion house in the Parish aforesaid, within the County of Midlesex; and also
the Hospital of Kilmainam in Ireland, with all their appurtenances for ever.

Yet it was provided by the said Act, that Sir William Weston and Sir John
Rauson Priors, as also some other of the Confriers, should have a certain
annual pension during their lives, with some reasonable proportion of their
own proper goods. And this was done (says the words in the statute) by the
agreement and assent of the Kings most excellent goodness.

Sir William Weston had given unto him one thousand pound of annual rent or
pension. Sir John Rauson five hundred Marks. Clement West Confrier, two
hundred pound. Thomas Pemberton, fourscore pound. Gyles Russell, one hundred
pound. George Ailmer, one hundred pound. John Sutton, two hundred pound. Edward
Bellingham, an hundred pound. Edward Brown fifty pound. Edmund Husse, an
hundred Marks. Ambrose Cave, an hundred Marks. Thomas Copledyke, fifty pound.
Cuthbert Leighton, threescore pound. Richard Broke, an hundred Marks. Henry
Poole two hundred Marks. William Tyrell, thirty pound. John Rauson, Confrier,
two hundred Marks.

To Anthony Rogers, Oswald Massingberd, James Husse, Thomas Thornell, Nicholas
Hopton, Philip Babington, Henry Gerard, Dunstan Nudegate, Nicholas Lambert, and
David Gonson, being Confriers professed, and having no certain living, was
given ten pound a piece of yearly pension.

And if any pro^es^ed in the said Religion were negligently forgotten, or
omitted out of that present Act, for lack of knowledge of their names; yet it
was ordered by the same, that they should have such honest, convenient, and
reasonable yearly pension, and portion of goods, as should please the Kings
Majesty to limit and appoint.

And by the said Act Io^n Mableston, Subprior of this Hospital in England;
William Ermested Master of the Temple of London: Walter Lymsey, and John Winter
Chapleines; were authorized to receive and enjoy, during their natura^l lives,
all such mansion houses, stipends, and wages, in as large and ample manner, as
ever they did before the sitting of that Parliament.

What other pensions were given, or how much the value in money was of the
yearly profits of these four last remembered, I do not read. But the
annuities or pensions appointed to the said two knights, and the Confriers,
amounted to the sum of two thousand eight hundred and seventy pound the
year, issuing out of the lands to this Hospital appertaining. And I find
that at the very same time of the dissolution of this Fraternity, certain
lusts and Tourneaments being holden at Westminster, wherein the challengers
against all comers were, Sir John Dudley, Sir Thomas Seymor, Sir Thomas
Poinings, Sir George Carew, knights, Antony Kingston, and Richard Cromwell,
Esquires. To each one of which, for a reward of their valiantness; the King
gave an hundred Marks of yearly revenues, and an house to dwell in, and both
of them, to them and their heirs for ever, out of the lands and livings
belonging to this Hospital. Of such a large extensure were her possessions.
And much what after this manner, the rest of the Manors, honors, lands,
tenements, rents, and reuersions, were bestowed; and likewise at that time upon
small considerations, the site and lands of all other Monasteries were begged,
bought, and alienated by such who respected their own profit above the service
of Almighty God. Albeit it was then declared, says Camden, that such religious
places, being of most pious intent consecrated to the glory of God, ^
might have been according to the Canons of the Church, bestowed in exhibition
and alms for Gods Ministers, relief of the poor, redemption of captives, and
repairing of Churches.

All Monasteries being thus suppressed; it followed that (under a fair
pretense of rooting out of superstition) all Chanteries, (...). ^7. Hen. 8. ^^.
^.
Colleges, and Hospitals, were likewise by Act of Parliament left to the
dispose and pleasure of the King: And all these Monuments (aforesaid) of our
forefathers piety and devotion, to the honor of God, the propagation of
Christian says and good learning, Camd. ^^. ^^^. (...).
and also for the relief and maintenance of the poor and impotent (if without
offense I may speak the truth.) All these, I say, for the most part, were
shortly after; to wit, within the remainder of his reign, and the short time
of his Sons, King Edward the sixth: every where pulled down, their revenues
sold and made a way: and those goods and riches which the Christian piety of
our English Nation had consecrated unto God, Id^^ ^^ ^^. l.
since they first professed Christianity, were in a moment, as it were,
dispersed, and (to the displeasure of no man be it spoken) profaned.

Thus have you seen, by degrees, the fatal and final period of Abbeyes,
Priories, and such like religious Structures; with the casting out to the wide
world of a^l their religious Votaries: chiefly occasioned by their own
abominable crying sins, more then by any other secondarie means; as plainly
does appear by the premises All which Queen Mary attempted to have restored
to their pristine estate, and former glory. But all in vain; for these
religious Edi^ices with the lands and possessions thereunto belonging, were so
infringed, alienated and transferred, that neither the power of Majesty, nor
the force of Parliament, could reduce them again to the proper use, for which
by the Founders they were intended.

confirmed by Parliament, to God and holy Church, all those Ecclesiastical
revenues, Parl. An 2. C^ 3. (...) C. ^. 4.
which by the authority of that high Court, in the time of her father King
Henry had been annexed to the Crown, to the great diminution and
impouerishing of the same. And this she did frankly and freely, moved thereunto
by her own conscience, saying (with a Christian and princely resolution I must
confess) to certain of her Counsel^our^, that albeit they might object
against her, Ho^^in^ p^ 112^
that the state of her kingdom, the dignity thereof, and her Crown
imperial, could not be honorably maintained and furnished, without the
possessions aforesaid; yet she set more by the salvation of her soul, then she
did by ten kingdoms.

And whereas in the reign of King Edward the sixth, In Parl (...) and 4 (...).
c. l. 12.
it was enacted, that all the books, called Antiphoners, Missales, Grailes,
Portuassis, and Latin Primmers, used for service in the Church, in the time of
Popery, should be clearly abolished; All images graven, painted, or carved,
taken out of any Church or Chapel, with the foresaid books, should be
defaced or openly burned. She being now more forward then wise to observe the
rites and ceremonies of the Romanists, caused the like books and images to be
bought, and brought again into all the Churches within her dominions. Holy
water, Pax, and censers were commanded to be employed at the celebration of
Masses, and Mattens, Oil, Cream, and Spittle, used in the Administration of
the Sacrament of Baptism. Altars furnished with pictures, costly couerings,
and the Crucifix thereon solemnly placed: Unto whom Lights, Candles, and
Tapers, were offered The restoration and dispose of these, as also of all
other matters concerning the Church, she committed to the Pope, and Cardinal
Poole his Legate, by whose authority and means by all probability, In Parl.
An^. and 2. Phil. ^^ Mar. cap 8. In Parl. ^^. Hen. 8. ^ap. ^
all Statutes made in her father and brothers reign against the Sea of Rome,
the Pope and his Supremacy were altogether repealed; and the six bloody
Articles enacted by Henry the eighth tyrannically put in execution; by force of
which (she being ouerswayed by the authority of Church men, for of her self
she was of a more facile and better inclined disposition) so many, in less
then four years continuance, were consumed with fire, for the testimonial of
their consciences in that case.

^eed. cap. 23.
In the heat of whose flames were burned to ashes five Bishops, one and twenty
Divines, eight Gentlemen, eighty four Artificers, one hundred husbandmen,
servants and laborers, twenty six wives, twenty widows, nine Virgins, two
boys, and two Infants, one of them whipped to death by Bonner, alias Savage,
Bishop of London; and the other springing out of his mothers womb from the
stake as she burned, was by the Sergeants thrown again into the fire. Sixty
four more, in those furious times were persecuted for their profession and
faith, whereof seven were whipped, sixteen perished in prison, and twelve
buried in dunghills, many lay in captivity condemned; but were released, and
saved by the auspicious entrance of peaceable Elizabeth, and many fled the Land
in those days of distress, which by her upon their return home were
honorably preferred, and provided for according to their worthes.

Queen Mary now dead, and Elizabeth of famous memory proclaimed Queen,
possessed of her lawful inheritance, placed in her glorious Throne, and
crowned with the imperial Diadem; presently after followed a Parliament,
wherein the title of Supremacy, In Parl. An. (...) c. ^.2. and ^.
and all ancient jurisdictions were again restored, all foreign power
abolished; and for the more augmentation and maintenance of her State royal,
it was ordained and established, that the first fruits and Tenths of all
Ecclesiastical livings, with the lands and Scites of Monasteries, given away
by Queen Mary, should be united and annexed again to the Crown; that all
Statutes should be repealed, which were enacted by the said Queen Marie, in
favor of the Romish Religion, and that the book of Common Prayer, used in
King Edwards time, for an uniform celebration of Gods divine service in the
English Churches, should be ratified and authorized again by this present
Parliament.

This Parliament ended upon the eight of May, upon the fourteenth day of the
same month next following, being Whitsonday, divine Service was celebrated in
the English tongue, whereby Gods word might be heard in a perfect sound, and
the prayers of the Congregation uttered with an understanding heart.

Soon after in the same year certain Commissioners were appointed in
several places, for the establishing of Religion throughout the whole Realm;
then all the religious houses which were reedified, erected, or restored by
Queen Mary, as the Priory of Saint John's Jerusalem; the Nuns and Brethren of
Sion and Sheene, the black Friars in Smithfield, the Friars of Greenwich, with
all other of the like foundation were utterly suppressed. All Roods and Images
set up in Churches, whose sight had often captiuated the senses of the zealous
beholder, and heated the blind zeal of many poor ignorant people, were now
themselves consumed in the fire, and with them (in some places) the copes,
vestments, altar-clothes, Amises, books, banners, and rood lo^^s, were like
wise burned in the open streets.

Upon the walls, pillars, and other places of all Churches, certain
Inscriptions were cut, painted, or engraven, which being holden to be
superstitious, were as then defaced, erazed, washed over, or obliterated: of
which a few for example.

This Inscription was usual to the picture of the blessed Trinity,
represented by the Effigies of an old man, our Savior in his bosom, and a
Dove.

Ave Pater, Rex Creator, Ave fili, lux Seruator.
Ave pax and charitas.
Ave simplex, Ave Trine, Ave regnans si^e si^e,
Vna summa Trini^as.
Under the picture of the blessed Trinity, ^^ lib. Co^
sometimes in the Abbey Church of Rufford in Nottinghamshire, as it is in the
book of the said house.

Sede Pater summa disponit secula cuncta:
Patre D^o genitus creat and regit omnia natu^.
Omnia vi^ificat procedens Spiritus almus.
Flamma, calor, pruna, tria sunt hec, res sed and vna^
Sic ab igne calor non diuiditur neque fulgor.
Ast his vnitis vnus subsi^lit and ignis.
Sic Pater and natus and Spiritus sed Deus vnus.
Huic laud munus qui regnat trinus and vnus.
Huic laus et doxa nunc et per secula cuncta.
Under the picture of Christ crucified. Nec Deus est nec Homo presens quam

Et Deus est et Homo que signat sacra figura.
Verus Homo verusque Deus tamen vnus vterque.
Probra crucis patitur, mortem su^it, et sepelitur

Id notum nobis crucis huius litera reddit,
Scilicet ipsius nota sunt c^ux et crucifixus:
Hec et ego veneror Iesum'quoque semper adore.
Again under the Crucifix. Quantum pro nobis Christus tulit ecce videmus
Et tamen a lachrymis heu lumina sicca tenemus.
Under the picture of Christ, usually in all Abbey Churches. Effigiem Christi
dum transis semper honora*
Non tamen effigiem sed quem designat adora;
Nam Deus est quod imago docet, sed non Deus ipsa:
Hanc videas, et mente colas quod cernis in illa.
And this.

Sum Rex cunctorum caro factus amore reorum.
Ne desperetis venie dum tempus habetis.
To the picture of Christ, speaking thus to man in the agony of his Passion.
Aspice mortalis, fuit vnquam pas^o talis?
Peccatum sperne, pro quo mea vulnera cerne.
Aspice qui transis, quia tu mihi causa doloris*
And thus, exhorting man to amendment of life.

Aspice Serve Deisic me posi^ere Iudei.
Aspice deuote, quoniam sic pendeo pro t^.
Aspice mortalis, pro te datur hostia talis.
In^roitum vite reddo tibi, read mihi te.
In cruce sum pro te, qui peccas desine pro me.
Desine, do veniam, dic culpam, corrige vitam.
The Knights Templers before they came to that house, now called the Temple,
had an house in Holborne, which is now Southampton place, where in their
Chapel was a representation of Christ's Sepulcher, with these verses brought
from Jerusalem. Vita mori voluit, et in hoc tumulo requieuit,
Mors quia vita fuit nostram victrix aboleuit.
Nam qui confregit nigra inferna ille subegit,
Educen^o suos cuius Dux ipse cohortis.
Tartarus inde gemit, et mors lugens spoliatur.
Another Inscription upon the same. Hac sub clausura recubat Christi caro puro,
Sub cura semper stat nostra figura.
Est Deus hic tantus natus de Vigine quantus,
Militie caput hic, mundi medicena iacet hic.
Another. Sum Deus, ex quo carnem sumsi, sed sine neuo:
^lebs mea me ligno fixit pendente maligno;
Aspice plasma tuum, qui transis ante sepulchrum.
Qui triduo iacui cum pro te passus obiui.
Quid pro me pateris, aut quae mihi grata rependis?
Sum Deus et puluis, sed regnes si modo serves.
Pro te passus, ita tu pro me prospera vita.
Pro te plagatus pro me tu pelle reatus.
Upon the picture of the holy Lamb.

Mortuus et viuus idem sum Pastor et agnus:
Hic agnus mundum instaurat sanguine lapsum.
Many were the Altars here in England consecrated to the blessed Virgin Mary,
more then to Christ; many the pictures and statues, many the Churches erected
and dedicated to her holiness, and many were the exorbitant honors, due only
to our blessed Savior, attributed to her heavenly Deity: As did appear by
Inscriptions numberless about her Altars. Of which some few.

In celo lata, nos seruet Virgo beata,
Sede locata pia; nostri memor esto Maria.

In the Churches of Corpus Christi most commonly these Inscriptions following.

Hic est cibus qui plene re^icit non corpus sed animam, non ventr^m sed mentem,
si quis ex hoc comederit, viuet in eternum.

Panis mutatur specie remanente priore,
Sed non est talis qualis sentitur in ore:

Indulgences and Pardons granted by the Bishop of Rome, to certain Churches
and Altars, were likewise depensild upon the walls. In form as follows.

Nihil certius.
Near to the place where relics were kept, such a like Inscription was
either painted, insculpt, or written upon a table hanging upon some pillar or
other of the Church.

Hic sacra sanctarum si nomina reliquiarum
Lector se^re velis docet hoc te charta fidelis.
De Christi cuna, que virga refloruit vna.
Coelo manna datum, paranymphi manna beatum.
Mensa gerens cenam, turbamque cibans duodenam.
Claud^tur and cista chlamys inconsutilis ista.
Sanguine Baptiste pariter locis omnibus iste
Est sacer and magni sudaria continet agni.
The relics kept in the Church being all thus reckoned, they were concluded
much what after this manner.

Horum reliquijs constat locus iste celebris
Hinc and multorum possemus nomina, quorum
Dicere si in tabula locus illis esset in ista;
Nos meritis horum redeamus ad alta polorum.
Inscriptions near and upon Bells.
Bells in time of Popery were baptized, they were anointed, oleo chrismatis,
they were exorcized; they were blessed by the Bishop: these and other ceremonies
ended, it was verily believed that they had power to drive the devil out of
the air, to make him quake and tremble, to make him at the sound thereof fly,
Tanquam ante crucis vexillum: that they had power to calm storms and
tempests, to make fair weather, to extinguish sudden fires, to recreate even
the dead; and the like. And as you may read in the Roman Pontificals, they
had the name of some Saint or other given (...) them in their Baptism; I will
bring in for example the Bells of the Parish Church of Winington in
Bedfordshire, whose names are cast about the verge of every one in particular,
with these riming Hexameters.

Nomina Campanis hec indita sunt quoque nostris.
1. Hoc signum Petri pulsatur nomine Christi. 2. Nomen Magdalene Campana sonat
melody. 3. Sit nomen Domini benedictum semper in euum. 4. Musa Raphaelis sonat
auribus Immanuelis. 5. Sum Rosa pulsata mundi que Maria vocata.
Upon or within the steeple these verses following, or others to the same
effect, were either engraven in brass, cut in the stone, or painted within, on
the wall. En ego campana nunquam denuncio vana;
Laudo Deum verum, plebem voco, congrego clerum.
Defunctos plango, viuos voco, fulmina frango,
Vox mea vox vite, voco vos ad sacra, venite.
Sanctos collando, tonitrus fugo, funera claudo.
Or these.

Funera plango, fulgura frango, Sabbatha pango,
Excito lentos, dissipo ventos, paco cruentos.
For the power of holy water sprinkled upon the people upon their entrance into
the Church, these Inscriptions.

Huius aque tactus depellet Demonis actus.
Asperget vos Deus cum omnibus sanctis suis ad vitam eternam.
Sex operantur aqua benedicta.
Cor mundat, Accidiam fugat, venalia tollit,
Auget ope^^, remouetque hostem, phantasmata pellit.
Organs, Pulpits, Portals, Crosses, Candlesticks, Roods, Crucifixes, and what
else of that kind were likewise thus inscribed, all which with the rest were
erazed, scraped, cut out, or taken away by the Commissioners, and instead of
them certain sentences of the holy Scripture appointed to be painted or
dispensild in every Church.

Thus judicious Reader thou may by this Chapter understand, how, by Gods
divine providence, and the depth of state policy, first of all, the
authority of the Pope here in England was abrogated, the Supremacy of the
Church in our Kings invested Abbeyes, and all other such like religious houses
subverted, Superstition and Idolatry rooted out and suppressed, and how this
kingdom, from all Papal infection cleared, and with the Sun shine of the
Gospel enlightened, the true worship of the everliving God was established.
Which only true worship that it may continue in our Church without Schisms,
rents, and divisions, unto the end of the world, let us all with unanimous
consent both of heart and voice, pray unto him who is Truth it self, and the
Author of all unity, peace, and concord.

Now gentle Reader give me leave to add unto this Chapter (howsoever thou will
say (perhaps) it is too long already) the copy of the Kings Warrant to
Commissioners, to take the surrender of Religious houses, as also a copy of an
Information to Queen Elizabeth, of the frauds and corruption of such so
employed by her Father; being in my judgment coincident with the Contents of

An Information made to Queen Elizabeth by...... of the several abuses and
frauds done unto the State general, and Crown by the corruption of such as
have bine employed by her Father upon the suppression of the Abbeyes, and
Continuance of the same.
Part of the corrupt, deceitful, fraudulente, and unrighteous dealinge of
many Subjects of this Realm at and since the visitation and suppression of
Abbeyes, which with all the rest God by his grace has made me hate and refuse,
and also deteste and resist in otheres to the vtmoste of my small powere,
being contrary to this commandment of the second Table, Thou shall not
^^eale: whereby the possessiones, revenues, and treasure of the Crown have been
immeasurably robbed and diminyshed, to the great offense of God, and slander of
the Gospel, and to the no small impouereshynge and weakenynge of the Imperial
Crown, and utter undoing of a number of your Majesty's pore Tenants and
Subjects, and so to the great slaundere of your Majesty, and withdrawinge of
their hearts from you, whose Act it is told them to be, and so to them it
seems, because some of your seals be at all or most part of them, and the
confirmacion of your head officers at the rest: and to the vttere spoiling and
undoing (before God and good men) of a number of learned persons and exelente
wits who understanding that many before them had byne thereby greatly enriched
and advaunced; and that the gapp thereunto as unto a virtue was made wide opene
for all without any punyshement, but rather commendacions, were and ^re still
the easilier ouercom by temptacion of the wisdom of Satane, the world, and
the flesh, to seek and labor to become rich by like wicked ways; of whom
as the number is now of late years increased, so also deceave they moore
subtillie and detestably, and in more things then ever before. For redress
whereof, and of a nombere of other cunning and clenly Thefts and decepts which
I know and can in time remember and discouere, beside the multetude out of my
compass said by common brute to be in other calings. There must be pennede (by
some persons learnede in the Law that be known to hate all kynds of
unrighteousness) some strong Act or Acts (to pass by Parliament, and
afterward^ to be roundly executed) with great penalties, forfeitures, and
ponyshments, to reche unto lands, goods, and body, as the greatness or the
smalnes of the case shall require, without the which God will be yet more
offended, the Gospel more slaundered, the Crown more impouereshed and
wekened, your people more undone, your Majesty more slaundered, your peoples
hearts more drawn from you, the learned persons and exelente wits of your
people more spoiled, and many other particular evils will grow thereby,
besides Gods great strokes: which at length will come without repentance and
amendment: Whereas if reformacion be had, God will be therein pleased, the Gospelle
commended, the Crown enriched, your people profited, there loves toward you
increased; the learned and exelente wits enforced from deceit, to seek
prefermente and welthe by godly and honest means; and many other things will
grow thereby, besides Gods good blessing which your Majesty shall be sure to
have for it.

Deceiptfull and unrighteous dealings, viz. at and upon the visitation and
suppression of Abbeyes.
Where the Images of gold and silver, etc. with the costelye Shrines,
Tabernacles, belles, stone, etc. and the household plate, householde stuff,
and furniture of household, and the Leases and chattalles, and the horses,
oxen, kine, sheep, and other cattle, and the superfluous howses and
buildings, and multitudes of other things that belonged to Abbeyes, etc. were
worth a million of gold. The salles of the part whereof were so cunningly
made, and the preservation of the rest was such that your Majesty's Father,
and the Crown of England hade in comparison but mean portiones of the same,
of which much was unpaid by ill dealinge in many years aftre. For the fynding
out of which, and punishyng the great decept and fraud, thear was not then,
nether has thear byne at any time since, for the like euilles afterward also
committed to this day any good order or diligent labor taken, but let pass,
as though to find out and punish such wickedness were no profit to the Prince
and Crown, or good service to God. All which have byne the easelier let slip,
because perhaps some of them that should have punyshed under the Prince might
also be partly guilty, and so, Ca^^^ce: Cathee.

Item, where diueres of the Visitores and Suppressores had afterward

Item, the most part of the Evedences of Abbeyes and Nunneries were Majesty's
time more playnlie a^pereth.

Item, Mannores, Lands and T^nements, and other hereditaments were often sold
at under yerly Rents, by many subtle deceipts and frawdes.

Item, many Lands and Tenements, etc. were sometime sold with thapportenances
at the old yerly Rents: but where the woods were vnvalued (as often they were)
the same went from the King without recompen^^.

Item, Mannores, Lands, and Tenements, etc. sold to diverse, and after the woods
were felled and sold, and the Rents enhaunced, or for great fines leased out
for many years, then the same Mannores, lands, etc. were returned to the king
in exchange for other lands that had plenty of woods, and were vnenhauncede,
and vnleased in all or in part, or the Leases were nere expyred.

Item, much Lands and Tenements, and many great woods, and other hereditaments
were then sold away, where the money for the same by deceptfull defrawde was
not paid in many years after the due days of paymente.

So likewise in the time of the reign of King Edward the sixth, your Majesty's
Brother, many things were done amiss, though not so many and so great as
befoar.

Exchanges more were then in King Henry's time, and almost as badde, whereof the
Rents of many of them must needs decay in a great part when that Leases
shall end that were made by the Exchang^r^s, or when their Bonds made to
warrant those Rents shall either be lost, or not extended.

Much Lands, etc. were sold at under values by great decepte of many.

And in the short time of the Reign of Queen M^ry your Majesty's Sister,
many great gifts, Sales, and Exchanges were made, wherein was great deceit and
loss to the Prince and Crown

In your Majesty's time and before, all or the greateste part of all the
Evidences of the Lands, possessions and hereditaments of all the Abbeyes, etc.
have by little and little by fraudulent means byne so pilfered, and sold away
and so drawn into many private men's hands, that there is almost none of them
left to your Majesty's use; so that your Majesty has nothing to mainteyne
your title if need so require, but only the long possession, and your own
Records made since suppression, whereof a number of them be gone.

This Informer, (a man in authority, as appears by the sequel, of whose name
I am ignorant) proceeds further in the rehearsal of many more deceipts,
frawdes, and corruptions, used by diverse of the Officers of those days, only
for their own lucre and advauncement, which are too many here to set down; I
will end this Chapter with the conclusion of his arguments.

When I speak (says he) write, or work against these, and multitudes of like
things, what ado there is on every side, and what outcries there i^ against me,
and what inward hatred is borne me, which sometime brek^s foarth, and shows it
self, by their sour looks, bittere speches, and taunt and by their liftings
at me, and paying me home one way or other when they can themselves, or when
others can for them, your Majesty wo^^ wondere if you knew; And the more
because some of them bear great show and name of good men and Gospelers: But
alas piteous ones God amend them and us all; That we together that prof^sse the
Gospel may study and strive not only to love and do what he commands, and
to hate and resist what he forbids; But also those of us that be in authore^^ to
bring all others there unto by great entreaty and good rewards, if that will
serve, if not by roughe threats, and sharp strokes, as he has appointed for
the bringing home unto himself of every creature.

CHAP. XVI. The time of the institution of Religious Orders. Their seu^rall
names and Authors, and the infinite increase of their Fraternities and
Sisterhoods.
THe Popes of Rome challenging a succession from Saint Peter, (...). Op^^
Cro^^g. page ^^0.
and seeking to imitate the Hebrews, began to institute Ostiaries, Acolites,
Exorcists, Readers, Subdeacons, and Deacons.

The Office of the Ostiarle was to open and shut the Church doors, Os^^ati^s.
to look to the decent keeping of the Church* and the holy ornaments laid up
in the Vestrie; which is now the charge of the Vergers (as I take it) in
Cathedral Churches.

Acolites, or Acoluthites, Acolites, or (...). Vid^s^s ^^mina Angel^^^ (...) S.
were to follow and serve the Bishop or chief Priest, to provide and kindle
the lights and lamps of the Church* and to register the names of such as were
catechized.

Exorcists had the power given them to expel unclean spirits; ^xorcists.
and by fasting and prayer, to free such persons as were so possessed.

Readers, Readers

by the Apostle Paul: did read the writings of the Prophets and Apostles, at
the time of morning prayer, and did feed, as it were, the people with such
divine lessons.

The office of the Subdeacons was to set and give out the Psalms in solemn
tunes, Subde^co^^.
to receive the oblations of the faithful, to write the lives and Agons of the
Martyrs, and to declare, or make more plain unto the people the Epistles of
the Apostles.

Deacons had the charge to relieve widows and orphans, Deacons.
and other poor faithful people; and to distribute unto them the alms which
devout Christians had given to that intent. They were also allowed to preach
the Gospel, Summa Angel. li^ra D.
to interpret the Scriptures, and appointed to adorn the sacred Altars, and
help the Priest in divine Service (a place officiated now by our Parish
Clerks) these were chosen to be men full of religion, integrity of life,
faithfulness and bounty, after the example of the Churhes of Jerusalem and
Antioch, ^riests.
who were called Clerks; some of these were made by the imposition of hands
Priests, others Deacons: to the end the Bishop of Rome might employ them to
instruct the Christians which then increased, and were so many, as he could not
alone execute the charge. To these Priests he gave the chief care of souls,
to the end that administering the Sacraments to the people of God, they might
with the Bishop attend prayer and preaching. Op^^e^ in loco ^ad.
Presbyterorum vero munus erat baptisare, Episcopis adesse consilijs,
orationibus esse intentos, frangere panem in commemorationem Christi,
annunciando mortem eius, orare super infirmos, vngentes eos oloo in nomine
Domini. The office indeed of Priests was to baptize; to be assistant to the
Bishops in Council, to be attent and earnest in prayer, to break the bread of
life in remembrance of Christ; preaching or declaring his death and passion: to
visit and pray for the sick, giving them extreme Unction in the name of the
Lord. The Author of the book called, S^^lla Clericorum.
And Presbyter, says one, dicitur quasi praebensiter; as showing the way of
salvation to the ignorant people. They were likewise, says the same Author,
called Sacerdotes, men consecrated to God in respect of their sacred orders,
and pious employments: which by him is thus deciphered. Quinque enim sunt
dignitates Sacerdotum prae ceteris. Primo dicitur sacerdos quasi sacris
dotatus, scilicet sacris ordinibus, quia ipse est in summo gradu, qui est
Sacerdotum. Secundo, Sacerdos quasi sacris is ded^tus, id est sacramentis; ad
sacrisicanda sacramenta; nam ipse sacri^ic^^ sacrosanctum corpus Domini cum
verbis, signis, prodigijs, and caetera sacramenta. Tertio, dicitur Sacerdos
quasidans sacra, dat enim Baptismum, confessionem, poenitentiam, indulgentiam,
Eucharistiam, benedictionem, and extremam vnctionem. Quarto dicitur Sacerdos,
quasi sacra docens: docet enim verba sancti Euangelij, and articulos rectae
fidei. Quinto, dicitur Sacerdos, quasi sacer dux, quasi ducatum praebens, and
iter populo ad regna coelorum, verbo sanae doctrinae, et vitae bono exemplo.
Whereupon this Distich was compiled: Sacris dotatus, et sacris deditus, atque
Sacra docens, sacra dans, et dux sacer esto Sacerdos.


Upon the division of Provinces into Parishes (of which hereafter) and building
of Churches (which work was effected with cheerful devotion) the fittest men
out of this holiest order, were chosen and appointed to consecrate the divine
Miestries of the Church. To such, or such particular congregations as were
committed to their charge, and of whose souls they had the cure. And such
Deacons, which as Parish Clerks, did help the Priests in the execution of
their sacred office; did most commonly after a short time, enter into the order
of Priestood, and took upon them the cure of souls, and the benefit of a fat
Parsonage, if they could procure it; in which promotion, if this or that Deacon
carried himself proudly, or any ways no^ to the contentment of his
Parishioners: such was the common saying, Prouerbium.
The Priest forgets that e're he was a Clerk.

These Priests were called Secular, and such as led a Monastical life Regular.
And so Canons were both secular and regular.

Chanons
The opinions of the first institutions of Chanons are very diverse; some refer
the beginning of a canonical life to Vrbin the first, a Roman Bishop, who
lived about the year of Grace 230. Others, and namely Possidomus, make Saint
Augustine the chief Author of this institution, who when he had gathered
together a company of godly men, who lived religiously, far from the noise
and trouble of the multitude, being made a Bishop, he built a Monastery for
Clerks and Priests within his palace, with whom he might live in common. Lib.
d^ pracipuis vib^^ Romans (...).
Onufrius Panuinus writes, that Pope Gelasius the first, about the year 493.
placed the regular Chanons of Saint Augustine at Latran in Rome; Pope Boniface
in the year 1298. placed there Chanons secular; Gregory the twelfth restored
the regular Calistus the third brought in secular Chanons again; and Pope
Paul, the second of that name, dispossessed them, and restored the regular. They
were wont to sleep upon mattresses, and had blankets of wool, they fasted
much, used great silence, and lived in common, having nothing proper to
themselves: they v^ed exercises two hours in the day, and at the end of the
year they made their procession. They did not admit any one to the habit
until he were seventeen years old; and they gave themselves to study and
preaching. The rule of these Chanons (confirmed by many Popes) consisted
chiefly upon three points, to have nothing of their own, to be chaste, and to
keep their cloisters. Which rule is deciphered in the old cloister of the
Monastery of Saint John Lateran, in riming verses, now hardly to be read, thus
Canonicam formam sumentes discite normam,
Quam promisistis hoc claustrum quando petistis,
Discite sic esse tria vobis adesse necesse;
Nil proprium, morum castum portando pudorem,
Claustri structura sit vobis docta figura:
Vt sic clarescant anime, moresque nitescant
Et stabiliantur animo qui canonicantur.
Vt coniunguntur lapidesque sic poliuntur.


Thus regular in holiness of good life, In the Plowmans tale.
and also in learning, both Priests and Chanons were of ancient times, but how
irregular afterward, let Chaucer tell you. Popes, Bishops, and Cardinals,
Chanons, Parsons, and Vicare
In Gods service I trow been falls,
That Sacraments sellen here,
And been as proud as Lucifere.
Each man look whether that I lie,
Who so speaks ayenste her powere
It shall be holden heresy.
In another place. And all such other counterfaitours
Chanons, Canons, and such disguised,
Been Gods enemies and traitors,
His true religion han foul despised.
As Gods goodness no man tell might,
Write, ne speak, ne think in thought,
So her falshed and her unright
May no man tell that ever God wrought*
And thus. They vsen horedome and harlottrie,
Couetise, pomp, and pride,
Sloth, wrath, and eke envy,
And sewen sin by every side,
Alas where think such to abide,
How woll they accounts yield:
From high God they mow hem not hide,
Such willers wit is not worth a nelde.


Passus 14. Ex Mss. in bib. Cot.
Piers the Plowman thus blanklie speaks of their pride.

Sir John and Sir Ieffery has a girdle of silver,
A Baselard or a ballocke knife, with buttons ouergilt,
And a Portus that should be his plow. Placebo ^o sing,
Had he never service to save silver thereto, seith it with idle will.
And hereupon he exhorts laymen not to be so liberal in bestowing their
goods upon the Clergy. Thus.

Alas ye lewd men much lose ye on Pryests,
And a thing that wickedly is won, and with false sleights
Would never wit of wittye God, but wicked men it had,
The which ar Pryests imperfit, and Prechers after s^^uer.
That with gile is gotten, ungraciously is spended;
Executours and sodemes, samoners and their lemmans:
So harlots and hoores are helped with such goods,
And gods folks for defaulte thereof, forfaren and spill.
These Canons had many cloisters here in England, great lands and revenues, and
were wondrous rich, the first Chanon Regular in this kingdom was one Norman,
whom Matilda wife to King Henry the first preferred to the government of her
Priory, called Christ-church, now the Dukes place within Aldgate London.

There are four rules, or religious Orders, that is to say, of S. Basil, S.
Augustine, S. Benet, and S. Francis, under which all other orders are
comprehended and governed. Of which my old Author Robert Longland, sieve
Johannes Maluerne in the vision of Piers Plowman gives a touch: where he
speaks of Pardons and Popes Bulls, on this manner.

At the dreadful dome when the dead shall arise
Pas^us ^.
And comen al to fore Crist, accountes for to give
How thou leadest thy life here, and his laws kepest
And how thou did day by day the dome will rehearse.
A poke full of Pardons there ne provincial lettres,
Though ye be founden in the fraternity of the iiii. orders,
And have indulgence an C. fold, but if Dowel ye help,
I beset yowr Patentes and yowr Pardons at a pyes hele.
And thus the same Author in another place, speaking of the pilgrimage to our
Ladies Shrine at Walsingham.

Hermets an heap with hoked staves,
Wenten to Walsingham, and her wenches after,
Great loubies and long, that loath were to swinke
Clothed em in copes, to be known from other,
And shopen hem hermets, her ease to have.
I found there Freres, all the four orders,
Preched to the people for profit of themselves,
Glosed the Gospel as hem good liked,
For covetous of Copes construe it as they would.
So Chaucer in his prologues and in the Character of the Friar mentions four
Orders.

A Friar there was a wanton and a merry,
A Limy^our, a full solemn man:
In all the Orders four is none that can
So much of daliaunce and fair language.
But to return to the first of the four orders, The (...)
which is that of S. Basil, (howsoever as I conceive the order of Saint
Dominicke was accounted one of the four here in England) this Basil surnamed
the Great, for his great learning, lived about the year of Grace 300. he was a
Priest in Caes^^a, the chief City of Cappadocia where he was borne, and
whereof afterward he was chosen Bishop. He was the Author of building of
Monasteries, whereas many might live together, for before his time the Monks
dwelt in caves and cells alone, in deserts and solitary places, from the which
he drew them into Coenobies or Couents: and instituted of discipline, by the
which they should no more wander, but be always bound by one form of
Religion. These Monasteries were schools, in the which the arts, and
Philosophy, together with Diuini^ie, true Religion and piety were taug^t, to
the end there might be learned and fit men always ready to govern the
Church; it is said that he built so great and spacious a Monastery in Armenia,
as it contained above 3000 Monks; and in the end reduced all the religious men
of the East to a good form of life. He died in the year 379, full of years
as of virtues, when Damasus the first of that name held the Sea of Rome, and
the Emperor Valens an Ari^n governed the East* This Emperor was determined to
have dispossessed him of his Bishoppricke, as he had done others, but hearing
him preach, and speaking with him at Cappadocia, he absteyned from expelling
him his seat; to which effect P. Opmer. thus.

Basilius tantae doctrinae ac sanctitatis suit, (...) 316.
vt et Valens abstinueri^ ab expellendo eum sede, cum reuersus Cappadociameum
concionantem audijsset, atque venisset cum illo in colloquium.

It is holden that this Basil was the first which caused Monks to make a vow,
after a years probation, to live in their Monas^eries until death, to promise
full obedience to their superiors, and not to contradict their ordinances, and
moreover to vow continency and poverty. This order wheresoever they live,
labor with their hands in imitation of the perfect Monks of Egypt: and what
they get with their labor, they bring in common, retaining nothing to
themselves. This order of this holy man does flourish at this day in Italy,
especially in the dominions of Venice, although all the Monasteries there which
are of this order, do acknowledge the Abbey of Grottaferata, twelve miles
distant from Rome for their mother. I do not find that any of this rule lived
ever here in England: which makes me believe that this was none of the four
Orders before specified.

The order of S. Augustine.
The next Monasticke Order confirmed by the Church of Rome, was that of the
Doctor of all Doctors, namely, Saint Augustine; He was borne in the Castle of
Tegast in Carthage, about the year of our redemption 358. his Fathers name was
Patricius, his Mothers Monica, by whose intrea^^es, mingled with tears, and
the learned Sermons of Saint Ambrose, he was drawn from the errors of the
Manachies; from Saint Ambrose as then Bishop of Millan in Italy, he returned
into his own country, where he obtained of the Bishop of Hippo (whereof he
was afterward Bishop himself) a garden without the Town, causing a Monastery
to be built there, in which he lived of the labor of his hands in all
integrity, according to the institution of the Primitive Church. He died of a
fever at Hippo* when he had sitten forty years in his Bishopric, being
seventy and six years of age, on the fifth of the Kalends of September,
leaving to posterity, two hundred and thirty books of his own writing. This
order multiplied greatly throughout the whole Christian world, howsoever
branched into many several orders, differing both in habit and exercises, as
also in rule and precepts of life.

An Epitaph to the memory of Saint Augustine which I found in the book of
Rufford Abbey.
Omnis plorat homo mox matris vt exit ab aluo,
Et merito, quoniam ve^it in vallem lachrimosam.
Solum nascentem risisse ferunt Zoroastrem,
Ergo monstrosum creed risum liquet istum;
Primus enim rerum fuit inventor magicarum.
Hoc Augustinus testatur vir preciosus.
Vir doctus, vir magnisicus, vir quippe beatus.
The order of S. Benet.
About some forty years after the death of Saint Augustine, Saint Benedict,
vulgarly called Benet, appeared to the world, who is accounted the Patriarch
and Father of all the Monks of Europe. He was borne in Vmbria, a region in
Italy, of the noble family of the Regards, his Fathers name was Propre, his
Mothers Abundantia, he was sent to Rome at the age of ten years to learn the
liberal Arts, but being weary of the tumults and war during the reign of
Justinian the Emperor, he went from thence into a desert near unto Sublacke,
a Town some forty miles from Rome; where he continued the space of three
years or thereabouts: doing very austere penance unknown to any save one
Monk called Roman; but being afterward discovered by certain Shepherds, the
people (by reason of the great ^ame of his integrity and holiness of life)
flocked from all parts to see him; who had such force to persuade them to
abandon the world, as in a short time they built twelve Monasteries, and having
given to every our of them a good Superior or Abbot, desiring solitariness,
he retired himself with a good number of his best disciples, to the mount
Cassin, near to the Town of old called Cassina. Where having ruined all the
idolatrous Temples, and broken down their Images; he built him a Monastery,
which he dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, with a Chapel to Saint Martin.
Drawing all the Monks, dispersed in Italy, into one society and company, to
whom he gave a certain rule in writing, by the which they and their
successors should govern themselves, according as Saint Basil had done
before him; and withal bound them to three several vows, Chastity,
Poverty, and Obedience to their superiors, which decree was ratified by the
Church of Rome for an Evangelical law. This congregation of the Benedictines
grew by little and little to be so great throughout all Christendom, ^
as is almost incredible. Nulla Monasteria nisi Bene^dictina erat apud Anglos
ab aetate Edgari vsque ad regnum Gulielmi primi. There was no Monasteries,
says a late Writer, amongst the English from the time of King Edgar, till the
reign of William the Conqueror, but Benedictines. This order, says the same
Author, came first into England with Austin the Monk, Bishop of Canterbury.
He the said Saint Benet, died about the year of our Lord five hundred and
eighteen, and was buried in his own Oratorie consecrated to Saint John: where
as before was wont to be the Altar of Apollo. He lived 63. years.

Saint Francis was borne in the Town of Assile in the Duchy of Spoletum in
Italy; The order of S Francis.
in his young years he dealt in the trade of Merchandise, but by reason of a
great sickness, at the age of two and twenty years, he contemned all worldly
dealings, and gave himself wholly to heavenly meditations; he put a shirt of
hair upon his bare skin, and a sack upon it, girding himself with a cord,
Opmer. opus Cron^g, ad a^. 12^^.
going also without hose or shoes, Et victus ostiatim emendicans, begging from
door to door; so as the fame of him being spread over neighbor countries,
many drawn by his holiness abandoned the world, and became his disciples,
making profession of poverty, but yet to labor and take pains for a poor
living. For these he built an Abbey in the Town where he was borne, and wrate
a rule, as well for those which were united unto him, as for such as should
come after him, which was approved and confirmed with many Indulgences,
Privileges, Graces, and Pardons, by Pope Innocent the third, and Honorius that
succeeded him; After the confirmacion whereof, he ordained that his Friars
should be called, Fratres minores, or Minorite Friars, to witness their
greater humility.

One Adam Sousbout a Germane Divine, Opmer. opus Cron^g. ad ann 1225.
Ann. 1227. upon his entrance into this order, writes thus to his Father at
Delphos.

Quam sit vita breuis, quam sit via lubrica, quamque
Mors incerta: bonis quae praemia, quaeque parata
Sint tormenta malis, horum meditatio nostra est,
Quod facimus, quod firmamus, quod et esse perenne
Optamus testamentum, Saluete, valete,
Care pater, cari Fratres, caraeque Sorores.
(...) ca. 34.
This Scraphicall Saint Francis died the fourth of October, 1226. and was
canonised by Pope Gregory the ninth, ann. 1276. Ann. 1224. About two years
before the death of Saint Francis, these Friars Minorites came into England, Et
benign a Rege Henrico tertio sunt suscepti, and Cantuar, collocati fuerunt:
They were graciously received of Henry the third, and placed in Canterbury. And
afterward, anno 1269, one of the Ancestors of Sir Dudley Dig, commonly
called Digges, Emit Insulam vocatam Bynnewyght in Cantuar. et locum Port super
stonestreete ad opus Fratrum Minorum, ^^land Comment.

The Friars Minors (says Stow, first arrived in England at Dover, nine in
number, five of them remained at Canterbury, and did there build the first
Covent of Friars Minors that ever was in England; the other four came to
London, and lodged at the preaching Friars the space of fifteen days, and
then hired an house in Cornhill of John Traners, one of the Sheriffs, they
bui^^ded there little cells, wherein they inhabited, the devotion of the
Citizens toward them, and also the multitude of Friars so increased, that they
were removed by the Citizens to a place in S. Nicholas Shambles, which John
Iwyn Citizen and Mercer of London, appropriated unto the Communalty of the
City, to the use of the said Friars, and became himself a lay Brother.

Contemporarie with Saint Francis was Saint Dominicke, a Spaniard, borne in a
Town called Calogora, in the Diocese of Osma. His fader was named Felix, and
his Meder Iohane, says an old Agon: from Calogora he came into Gascoigne,
where he continued ten years preaching, and drawing Christian Princes into
arms against the Albigeo^s, certain Heretics, Qui damnato matrimonio vagos

persuaded licentious copulations, and forbad the eating of flesh, whose errors
he repressed by his Sermons From thence he went to Rome to the Council of
Lateran, under Innocent the third, where he obtained license of the said Pope*
to put himself under what rule he should like best* that was allowed by the
Church: whereupon he made choice of that of Saint Antonie, with sixteen of his
disciples, and having made certain constitutions, it was confirmed by Honorius
the third; about the year of our Lord, 1206. Then going to Toulouse he
exhorted his Friars, and sent them to preach, two and two together, persuading
them to be preachers both in deed and name; These Friars Preachers came first
into England in the year 1221. where they had loving entertainment and houses
built. Of which my old Author. (...). of Gloucester.

All things degenerate in time, ^
and stray in a manner from the right course; for example, the order of Saint
Benet which had flourished a long space with great reputation of holiness,
di^^ered so much from the first institution of their Founder, that neither the
decrees and authority of holy Fathers general and provincial Councels could
reform or draw them to their first principles, until the sanctity of one
Odo, or Otho, Abbot of Clu^^^ Burgandy, and one of Saint Benets order, revived
in a manner from (...) to life this Monastical profession, forcing them to
observe* and observing himself from point to point all that was practiced in
the time of S. Benedict. So as many of their Abbots which were drawn by his
good example, reformed also their Abbeyes, not only in France, but as well in
Sp^^ne, Germany, Italy, and England; and for that this reformation (...) his
first beginning at Cluni; the union of so many Abbeyes was called the
congregation of Cluni, and every year, by the Popes permission and authority,
all the Abbots of this congregation met at a certain place, and they called it
the general Chapter, whereas they treated of the order and life of Monks,
putting out, and punish^ng such as had offended. This Odo lived in the year of
our Lord, 913.

It was no long time after, ere that these Benedictines fell again to their
old vomit, Ciste^ci^n Monk.
their great wealth having made them, proud, idle, luxurious, careless of Gods
house; and in most or all of their actions, extremely vicious. Whereupon one
Robert Abbot of Molesme a Town in Burgundy, pe^ceiuing that the Benedictines
Monks of his own house (as of all other Monaster^es) had almost quite left
and forsaken the ancient rule and discip^i^e that Benet had given them; he left
his own house, taking with him one and twenty of the honestest Monks he could
find, to a solitary stupendiou^, and never inhabited place, called Cisteux,
or Cistercium, near to ^^^gres, in the said Duchy of Burgundy, where he
erected a new Abbey for his new companions, whom he called Cistercians, of the
place where the Abbey was situated.

The liberties, immunities, and privileges of this Order was generally
confirmed by Alexander the fourth, Bishop of Rome, circa An 1258.

This Cistercian Brotherhood was first established here in England by one Walter
Espeke, who founded the first Abbey of the said Order at Riuaux, or Rival in
Yorkshire, about the year 1131. according to this old Distich, sometimes
depicted upon the wall at the entrance into the said Abbey.

Some fifteen years after this foundation, and about the year 1098. S.
Bernard surnamed the Mellifluous, a man noblely descended, borne at the Castle
of Fountenay in Burgundy, with thirty of his companions, amongst which three
were his own brethren, became religious men in this Monastery. This Bernard
in short time became very famous, as well for his learning (of which his divine
writings full of sweetness bear witness) as for the holiness of his life,
in regard of which he was sent by his superior to lay the foundation of that
great and famous Abbey of Clareuaux, or Claravallensis, near to the river
Aulbe, about Lang^es; which Abbey a Nobleman of the country had then lately
built; and thus began the Monks of the Order of Saint Bernard, ^ernar* li^^
Monke^.
which is all one with the Cistercian Monks, saving a little difference in the
habit, both of them observing the rule of Saint Benet. This good man Saint
Benet came to the Abbey of Cisteux, when he was eighteen years old, at the
age of 25 he was consecrated Abbot of Claravall: Opus Cron. page 371 ad An.
11^8.
Et diuino magis instinctu, quam humana industria legem Domini didicit, quam
tanta doctrinae munificentia, et eloquij suavitat^ enarrauit, vt communi
Doctorum consersu Mellistui Doctoris cognomen sit adeptus, says Opmer. The
Archbishoprickes of Genua and Millan he refused, and only contented himself
with the government of this Abbey of Claravall, in the which he continued 38.
years. He died the fifth of November, about the year of Grace, 1160. and was
buried in his own Monastery, when he had lived, 63, years. He built the
Monastery of Saint Vincent and Anastasius in Rome, to the government of which
he preferred one Peter Bernard, his Scholar, who was afterward Pope of Rome,
by the name of Eugenius the th^rd. In his time by himself and his means one
hundred and six Abbeyes of this Order were built and reestablished; upon the
forefront or some other places within these Abbeyes, this sentence is most
commonly depensild, graven, or painted; taken out of Saint Bernard.

Bonum est nos hic esse, quia homo viuit purius, cadit rarius, ^urgit v^locius,
incedit cautius, quiescit securius, moritur felic^us, purgatur (...), and
praemiatur copiosius.

Amongst many Epitaphs made to the immortal memory of this Mellifluons
Doctor, these following may suffice. Ecce latet clare vallis clarissimus Abbas;

It is said by one, (...) S. B^rn.
that approaching near to his end, he spoke thus to his brethren: Tria vobis
obseruanda relinquo, que in stadio presentis vite quo cucurrimemini me pro
viribus observasse. Nemini scandalum facere volui and si aliquando accidit
sedaui vt potui. Minus semper sensui meo quam alterius credidi. Lesus de
ledente nunquam vindict im expetij. Three things I require you to keep and
observe, which I remember to have kept to my power, as long as I have been in
this present life. I have not willed to slander any person, and if any have
fallen, I have hid it as much as I might. I have ever less trusted to my own
wit and understanding, then to any others. If I were at any time hurt, harmed,
or annoyed, I never craved vengeance of the party which so wronged me. Which
is thus more succinctly set down by another, who has written the life of the
said Bernard.

Beati Bernardi metricum Testamentum

Celesti^ Monks.
Within one hundred years after the first spreading abroad of these Cistercian
and Bernardin Monks; the Benedictines wanted another reformation* which was
attempted by Peter, one of the same Order, surnamed ^^^oron, of a Mountain so
called; at the foot of which he lived in a cave for the space of three years,
doing daily penance. Upon this mountain he built a little Church, which he
called of the holy Ghost; be ware a^wayes a ^l^aine of Iron upon his bare
flesh, upon it a shirt of hair, being in continual prayer, and reforming the
rule of Saint Benet, which was then much degenerated. He obtained of the Pope
a confirmation of his rule, upon which he celebrated the first general
Chapter of his Order. After which in the seventy ninth year of his age, he
was chosen Pope, about the year of our redemption, 1^94. by the name of
Celestin the fifth, where upon this reformed order were called Celestins: the
number of which increased so fast, that he himself consecraced for them fix
and ^hirtie cl^^sters in Italy, wherein were six hundred Monks; amongst
others this was one of Celestin the Popes caueats for his new reformadoes.

Tunc Celestinus cris si celestia mediteris.
If heavenly things thoult meditate,
Then shall thou live in heavenly state.
Their first coming into England was much what about the year 1414.

The sanctity of the Francischan Minorite Friars grown cold, one Ber^ard of
Sienna, ^
a gentleman of a noble extraction, moved with an holy and (...) devotion,
labored much for the reformation of that Order, which (...) some assistants
effected, taking away the abuses which were crept (...) causing the Friars to
live in common, and to have nothing proper to (...), following simply the
institution of their father Saint Francis (...) called Obseruant Minorite
Friars, because they were obseruan(...) S. Francisci and propterea meliores:
more obseruant to keep the (...) and orders of Saint Francis, and therefore
the better. This Order (...) the year of Iubile, 1400. or thereabouts: it was
first confirmed by (...) Cou^^ell of C^^s^^nce* afterward by Eugenins the
fourth, and other (...) the fourth brought them into England, and Henry the
seventh auhmented their numbers: in whose time they had six famou^ Cloisters
here in this kingdom. Many other reformations have been^ (...) time to time of
the Franciscans, as by the Minims, Reco^lects, Pen^ries, Capuchins, etc. and by
many others; which happened sinced (...)lution here in England, or much what
thereabouts.

One Norbert Archbishop of Magdebourgh, ^
leaving the world, retired himself with certain companions into a certain
place called (...) of which this order took denomination, where he squared
(...) himself, his fellows and successors to observe, much what after the
order of Saint Augustine; which was approved and confirmed by Calixtus the
second. Honorius the second made them regular Charions. Their Abbots were
perpetual, and ever consecrated by Bishops. They had power to confer their
lesser Orders to their Monks, and to bless all the ornaments of the Church,
and to do all other ceremonies, but where as conse^ration is required in the
blessing; yet they might celebrate so^emne and (...) Mass, with the myter,
crosier staff, cappe, and other ornaments, which belong to the Episcopal
order and dignity.

The first institution of this order was about the year 1120. their first
house here in England was at Newhouse in Lincolnshire.

These Votaries pretend to have had their first institution at mount Carmel in
Syria, ^
where Elias and other heretofore lived solitarily, and that the place being
inhabited by many Hermites; Almericke Bishop of (...) drew them together,
living dispersed about the mountain, and (...) them a Monastery in that mount
near unto a fountain. They say a f^th^^r one Albert Patriarch of Jerusalem, a
very famous man, set downea rule from the life of Elias, out of a certain
Greek book of the institution of the first Monk, and from the rule of Saint
Basil the Great, giving it to keep to one Brocard, who was Prior of Mount
Carmell, and to his Hermits, which rule of Albert they vowed to observe, which
was afterward confirmed by Pope Honorius the third. They affirm that the
Virgin Mary appeared unto one of their order, and presented unto him a ^
Scapularie, saying, Receive, my beloved, this Scapularie which I give unto thy
order, in sign of my fellowship. Whereupon they usurp the title of (...) tres
Ordinis beatae Mariae Virginis de monte Carmelo: Friars of the Order of the
blessed Virgin Mary of mount Carmell. Their first apparition (...) the world
was about the year 1170. Their entrance into England, and seating themselves
at Newenden in Kent, of which hereafter, was about the midst of the reign of
King Henry the third. These, like as other Orders, have been diverse times
reformed, ever as they did degenerate from their primitive sincerity: at this
day they are called Carmes discalced, or bare footed Friars, by a certain
constitution confirmed by the Apostolic authority, in a general Chapter
held at Alcara de Henares, in the year of our redemption, 1581. There were
likewise Carmelin or Carnie(...) Nuns here in England.

John Bale who writ of the writers and the best learned men of great Britain, ^
writ also a large Treatise of this Order of Carmes, or Carmelites: whose
antiquity, institution, and progress he sets down in one of (...)sages, as
follows.

He speaks much in the honor of this religious Order, of which he was a
member in the Monastery of the Carmes within the City of Norwich; and finds
himself much aggrieued at a certain Lollard, as he calls him, and a Friar
mendicant, who made an Oration and composed certain virulent meeters against
this and other of the Religious orders; which he caused to be spread abroad
throughout the most part of England, in the year 1388. and here will it
please you read these his cursing rimes.

Per decies binos Sathanas capiat Iacobinos;
Propter et errores Jesus confunde Minores;
Augustienses Pater inclite stern per enses;
Et Carmelitas tanquam falsos Heremitas:
Sunt confessores Dominorum seu Dominarum,
Et seductores ipsarum sunt animarum.

De libro vite, quibus dicat Deus. Ite.
These Sathanicall strong lines (as the phrase is now) did at the first gre^^ly
distaste my ^^^^end Author John Bale, being one of the Fraternity: Sed(...)
deformitatem suam videbat, but afterward when as he say his own deformity
and blindness, exuebat habitum sise professionis, he put off the habit of his
cloistered profession; he rooted out, erazed, and defaced the maleuolent
character of Antichrist (as he says himself) and consequently embraced the
reformed Religion; and writ many-most bitter Inuectiues against al sorts of our
English Votaries.

This Bale flourished in the reign of King Henry the eighth, and was living in
the second year of Edward the sixth, about which time he writ his Centuries.

Thus much (which is more then I determined to have spoke) touching the order
of the Carmes.

The order of Grand Mont was instituted at Grand Mont in Limosin in France, The
Order of (...)
about the year of our redemption, one thousand seventy six, vn^der the rule
of Saint Benedict, by Stephen a gentleman of Auuergne, who being sent by his
father to Molon Bishop of Be^uent, to be instructed by him, he spent twelve
years learning the institutions and rule of Saint Benedict. Going from thence,
and having duly observed the lives of many Hermites, and Monks, and seen
what was worthy of imita^i^n, in the end he se^^ed himself upon the top of an
high hill in Limosin, being at that time thirty years old, whereas he built
a little cottage. He prescribed a rule of Saint Benedict to his disciples,
himself living with bread and water, and died being eighty years old.

I find very few Couents of this religious Order here in England, one there
was at Abberbury in Shropshire confirmed by the Bull of Gregory the ninth,
Bishop of Rome: as follows.

Gregorius Episcopus Seruus sernorum Dei. Dilectis filijs Priori and Fratibus

Dat. Avagnie. Non. Febr. Pontificatus nostri. Anno Sexto. To speak nothing of
their opinion (being altogether unprofitable) who (...), Saint Peter's disciple
and Bishop of Rome, (...) or the (...) of the holy Cross.
was the first founder of this order. It is received for more truth, that one
Cyriacus Patriarch of Jerusalem (who showed S. Helen (the mother of Great
Constantine) where the Cross was whereon our blessed Savior was crucified)
was the first that instituted this Order, in memorial of the invention of the
Cross; and gave ord^^ that these Friars should ever afterward carry a Crosle
in their hands: but by reason of (...) his martyrdom, under the Apostata
Julian, and the cruel persecutions of the Christians, this order became almost
quite extinguished, until Pope Innocent the third gave it new life: since
which time it ha^h ever flourished here and beyond. Seas with some little
reformation like the rest of its fellows This holy order came into England in
the year of our salvation, 1244. Their first C^oister was at Colchester, their
greatest Monastery was near unto the Tower hill London, as yet called by the
name of Cruched Friars. They did not of late as the first institution, carry
the Cross in their (...), but ware a cross of red cloth or skarlet fixed to
then habit on their breast.

About the year 13^7 the order of the Trinitarian Friars came into England;
Trinita^ian (...).
an order whose chief charge was to go and gather money to redeem Christians
that were captives under the ^^ranny of the (...) and Infidels; whereupon they
were called Monachi de Redemptio^e (...) rum, Monks of the redemption of
captives. This order was instituted by a Friar, called John Matta, and Felix
Anachorita, who lived a solitary life in France, and were warned in their
sleep (as the tale goes) to repair to Rome to the Pope, and to seek for a
place of him, to build them a cloister. Which they did, and their petition
being to them granted, they laid the foundation of the Monastery now called
Saint Thomas of the Mount, in mount Celia Rome; wherein Friar John died, and
was buried, as appears by an Arch or ancient Sepulcher of marble in the little
Church of the said Church, on the which this Epitaph or Inscription is engraven.

Trinitarians say, that the holy and blessed Trinity, and not Friar John,
neither any of the Saints, gave them this their rule and order, to which effect
in all their Couents these Rimes are painted or engraven.

Hic est ordo ordinatus,
Non a sancto fabricatus,
Sed a solo summo Deo.
This blessed Order first began
By God, and not by Saint, nor man.
Robertin (...).
For the foundation of these Friars, I will use the words of the famous
Antiquary John Leyland in his Commentaries; who flourished in the reign of
King Henry the eighth, Cui a Bibliothecis erat; who died in the reign of
Edward the sixth of a Phrenesie, to the great grief of all such as then did,
or ^ow do take delight in the abstruse study of reverend Antiquity. He lies
buried in Saint Michaels Church in Pater Noster Row, London.

The Priorie of Knasborough, ^
says he, is three quarters of a mile beneath Ma^ch Bridge, which goes over
Nid, one Robert Flower, son of one Tork Flower, that had been twice Mayor of
York, was the first beginner of this Priory: he had been a little while
before a Monk in New minster Abbey in Morpeth, within the County of
Northumberland, forsaking the lands and goods of his father, to whom he was
heir and firstborne son, and desiring a solitary life as an Hermit,
resorted to the Rocks by the river of Nid, and thither, upon opinion of his
sanctity, others resorted; for whom and himself he built a little Monastery;
got institution and confirmation of an Order about the year 1137 which after
his own name he called Robertins. Howsoever his company of Friars were
instituted of the order De redemptione captiuorum, alias, S. Trinitatis.

King John, as he says, was of an ill will to this Robert Flower at the first,
yet afterward very beneficial both to him and his.

Some of the Flowers lands at York, were given to this Priory, and the name of
the Flowers of late days remained in that City.

Many miracles, as it is said, were wrought at the Tomb in his own Priory,
wherein he was interred.

Eodem anno claru^t fama Roberti Heremitae apud Knaresburgh, ^
cuius (...) oleum medicinale fertur abundanter emisisse.

In the same year the same of Robert the Hermit of Knarsborrow spread it
self clearly abroad; whose Tomb, as the report went, cast forth abundantly
medicinable oil, says Mat. Paris the Monk of Saint Albon^, who lived in
those days. This Order, as I take it, was abolished before the dissolution.

These Friars challenge and derive their first institution from Saint Antonie,
(...).
who lived about the year of our redemption, 345. howsoever they obs^rae and
follow the rule of Saint Augustine; but whosoever was their first Patron it
skills not much. Upon this occasion following, they came first into England.

Edmund, the son and heir of Richard Earl of Cornwall, ^
who was second son to King John; being with his father in Germany, where
beholding the relics, and other precious monuments of the ancient Emperors,
he espied a box of Gold; by the Inscription whereof he perceived (as the
opinion of men then gave) that therein was contained a portion of the blood of
our blessed Savior.

He therefore being desirous to have some part thereof, by fair entreaty and
money obtained his desire, and brought the Box over with him into England:
bestowing a third part thereof in the Abbey of Hales; which his father had
founded, and wherein his father and mother were both buried, thereby to enrich
the said Monastery, and reserving the other two parts in his own custody,
till at length moved upon such devotion as was then used, he founded an Abbey
at Ashrugge in Hertfordshire, a little from his Manor of Berkamsted, in which
he placed Monks of this order, Bonhommes, Good men: and assigned to them and
their Abbey the other two parts of the said sacred blood. Whereupon followed
great resort of people to those two places, (induced thereunto by a certain
blind devotion) to the great emolument and profit of these Good-men the
religious Votaries.

The superior of this Order was called a Rector, or a Father Guardian.

Bethlemit Friars.
About the year 1257. the Bethlemit Friars had their dwelling in Cambridge, who
should be the first institutor I do not read; their rule and habit was much
what like that of the Dominicans; saving that they wore a star in their
breast wrought upon their habit, in memorial of the star which appeared at
the time that our Savior was borne in Bethlem. This Order was extinct before
the suppression.

^
This religious Order was first instituted in the year of our Lord God, 1080.
upon this occasion (the story is frequent) a Doctor of Paris, famous both for
his learning and godly life; being dead and carried to the Church to be buried,
when as they sung over his body the lesson which begins, Responde mihi quot
habes iniquitates, Answer me how many iniquities thou have, the body, sitting
up in the coffin, answered with a terrible voice, Iusto Dei iudicio accusatus
sum: I am accused by the just judgment of God: at which voice all the company
being much amazed, they defe^red the interment until the next day; at which
time upon the rehearsal of the same words, the body did rise in like manner,
and said, Iusto Dei iudicio iudicatus sum, I am judged by the just judgment of
God. The third day he raised himself up as before, saying, Iusto Dei iudicio
condemnatus sum, I am condemned by the just judgment of God. Amongst many
Doctors which assisted these Funerals, one Bruno, a German, borne at Colleyn,
of a rich and noble family, Chanon of the Cathedral Church of Rheimes in
Champaigne, being stricken and fearfully affrighted at this strange and
neuer-heard of spectacle, began to consider with himself, and to reuolue and
i^erate very often these words following, Si iustus vix salvabitur, impius and
peccator vbi erit: If such a pious man as he was in the opinion of the world,
be damned by the just judgment of God (thinks he) what will become of me and
many thousands more, far worse and more wicked in the eye of the world then
this man was. Upon this deep consideration, Bruno departed from Paris, and
took his journey together with six of his Scholars, to live solitarily in
some wilderness; and not long after came to the Province of Dolphine in
France, near to the City of Grenoble, where he obtained of Hugh Bishop of
that City, a place to build him a Monastery, on the top of an high
stupendous hill, called Carthusia, from whence the Order took the name. They
gave themselves to silence, and reading, and separated themselves by little
Cells one from another, lest they should interrupt one another quiet. They
spent some hours in the labor of their hands, and some in the writing of
godly books, both to relieve their wants, and to do service to the Church of
God. Many works of theirs are still extant; out of which, tending to
mortification, the Jesuit Parsons collected the Resolution.

They did macerate their bodies by fasting and discipline, and in the end
resolved to eat no flesh, during their lives.

This donation of Bishop Hugh (who became himself one of their order) was
confirmed by Hugh Bishop of Lions, and afterward by Pope Urban the second. The
said Pope Urban (as the story, which I have read, depicted round about the
Cloister of the Carthusians at Paris, does show) sent for the foresaid Bruno to
Rome (whose disciple he had been) where he remained for a time, and did much
help to pacify the troubles there at that time by his prayers; he parted from
Rome, and taking his way by Calabria, he came into a desert, called the Tower
in the Diocese of Squilace, where he stayed with his compa^ions, making their
residence in certain caves under the ground. The which when one Roger the
Prince of that country understood, he went to visit this holy man Bruno, and
gave to him and his society all that desert; whereas they built a Church, in
the which Bruno remained alone, where his companions lived, and in that place
he died, ann. 1102. and there was buried. Upon whose Sepulcher this Epitaph
was insculped.

Primus in hac, Christi fundator ouilis, Eremo
Promerui fieri, qui tegor hoc lapide.
Bruno mihi nomen, Genetrix Germania, meque
Transtulit ad Calabros grata quies nemoris.
Doctor eram, Preco Christi, virnotus in orb:
Desuper illud erat, gratia non meritum.
Carnis vincla dies Octobris sexta resoluit.
Ossa manent tumulo, spiritus astra petit.
He was canonized in the year 1520.

Priors of their grand Monastery at Carthusia from Bruno the first, Antiq de
Paris liver ^^^und.
till Bruno d' Affrinques, who governed that house, ann. 1611. have been
forty and four.

This order came into England about the year 1180. and at Witham in
Somersetshire built their first cloister. Afterward they came to London and
had a fair sumptuous house near unto Smithfield London, which is now Suttons
Hospital; another they had called Sein or Shene, in the county of Surrey, now
best known by the name of Richmond.

There were four Orders here in England of begging Friars, Begging F^ier^
who did challenge for their Patrons S. Augustine, S. Francis, S. Dominicke,
and Saint Basil, but in their discipline and rule of life, they came far
short of their first Institutors, who both took pains with their hands as
laborers, and as learned writers, as their works do testify; of all Orders
these Mendicants have ever been most bitterly inueighed against by their own
writers: as I shall show hereafter.

Quidam nouus ordo Fratrum Londini apparuit, Friars of the back.
and incognitus. Papale tamen autenticum palam ostendens; ita vt tot ordinum
confusio videretur. A certain new and unknown order of Friars appeared in
London; showing openly the Popes authentical Bull for their admission; so that
then there seemed to be a confusion of so many Orders, In An 1297. Hen. 3.41.
says Paris. These were called Fratres de poenitentia Jesus, or Fratres de
Sacca: Friars of the repentance of Jesus, or Friars of the Sack, for that they
carried sacks, and for that they were clad in sackcloth. These had their first
house a little without Aldersgate London; and obtained license of King Henry
the third in the fifth year of his reign, Stow Survay.
to remove from thence unto any other place, and within some two years
afterward he gave to them the Jews Synagogue in Colmanstreet ward, which was
defaced by the Citizens of London, after they had slain seven hundred Jews,
and taken away all their goods. After which time Eleanor, wife to King Edward
the first, took into her protection, and warranted unto the Prior and Brethren
De poenitentia Jesus Christi, of London, the said land in Colechurch street, in
the Parish of Saint Olaue in the old Jury, and S. Margaret in Lothbury, by her
granted, with consent of Stephen de Fulborne, Vnder-Warden of the Bridge-house,
and other Brethren of that house, for threescore Marks of silver, which they
had received of the said Prior and Brethren of Repentance, toward the building
of the said Bridge.

This Order of Friars gathered many good Scholars, and multiplied in number
exceedingly, until by a general Council it was decreed, that there should no
more Orders of begging Friars be permitted, but only the four Orders, and so
from that time these Friars decreased and fell to nothing. There were also
Nuns of this order, Nuns Sachettes.
which were called Sachettes, whether they had any Covent in England or not, I
do not know. But great S. Lewis King of France, being stirred up by Queen
Blaunch his mother, in the year of our salvation, Antiquitez. de Paris lib. 2.
1261. having given unto the Brethren of the Sack, or of the repentance of
Jesus Christ, a certain house upon the river of Seine, a little beneath S.
Michaels bridge, in the Parish of Saint Andrew des Arts at Paris, as by his
charter (which I have read) appears, gave also to the Nuns of the same
order, another house to inhabit in the said Parish, where neither of the
orders made there any long abode but were expelled in the time of the said
King, leaving only the name of Sachettes unto the street.

The order of S. John of Jerusalem.
About the year 1048. (the Sarazins being masters of Jerusalem, and of the holy
Temple which they ruined) certain gentlemen and Italian Merchants used to
frequent the ports and maritime towns of Syria and Egypt, who (for that they
brought merchandise which was pleasing unto those countries) were well
entertained, not only by the governor of the Town, but by the Calife of
Egypt. These Christians going often to Jerusalem to visit the holy places, and
having no place of retreat within the city, they obtained leave to build a
Church, a Palace, with certain Monasteries for the lodging of Pilgrims. But
in the end they caused an Hospital to be built for the receiving of all sorts
of Pilgrims, both sick, and whole, and in like manner a Church, which was
dedicated to S. John Baptist.

In the year 1099. the city of Jerusalem being recovered against the
impulsions of the Infidels by Godfrey of Bullein Duke of Lorraine, this order
was instituted; Sandys Relation.
the Kings of France were sovereigns of this order, who granted them diverse
immunities. They bare five crosses gules, in form of that which is at this day
called Jerusalem cross, representing thereby the five wounds that violated the
body of our Savior. None were to be admitted if of a defamed life, or not of
the Catholic religion. They were to be gentlemen of blood: and of sufficient
means to maintain a port agreeable to that calling, without the exercise of
mechanical sciences: as appears by these demands propounded by the
Pater-Guardian upon their admission and the Knights answers.

Anno Dominii 1117. Gotfredus Aldemarus Alexandrinus, ^
and Hugo de Planco de Paganis ( Godfrey (aforesaid) Duke of Lorraine, and King
of Jerusalem being dead, and Baldwin then reigning) this order of Knighthood
first began, and a seat was granted them in the Temple of Jerusalem, whereupon,
they were called Knights Templers, or Knights of the Temple. By entreaty of
Stephen Patriarch of Jerusalem, Pope Honorius brought in this order, and
confirmed their society, giving them a white garment, whereunto Eugenius the
third added a red cross on the breast. The charge of these Knights, was, to
guide Travelers on the way of Jerusalem, and to entertain strangers. Of the
time when these, as also the other Knights, came first to have Hospitalls and
houses here in England, I do speak hereafter.

Monks and Nuns Gilbertines. Bale. Cent. 1.
In the year after Christ's Nativity, 1148. (contrary to Justinians
constitutions, which forbad double Monasteries, that is to say, of men and
women together) one Gilbert, Lord of Sempringham in Lincolnshire, whose fathers
name was Ioceline, a knight; this Gilbert was a man very deformed in his body,
but very studious and learned. He went over into France, where by his study in
the liberal Arts, he obtained both the name and degree of Master: and coming
home, he instructed both the boys and girls of his own country in the same
disciplines. Out of which number, when they came to maturitie of years, he
collected a company consisting of men and women, and gave them a rule to
observe, which he had taken out of Saint Augustine, and Saint Benets rules.
Eugenius the third, Bishop of Rome (admiring much his devotion and forwadnesse,
like as others did his holiness) confirmed this his religious order. Which so
grew and increased, that himself laid the foundation of thirteen religious
honies of the same Order, (...) Cent. 2.
whereof the chiefest was at Sempringham, and whiles he lived (which was one
hundred and six years) had in them seven hundred Gilbertin Brethren, and
eleven hundred Sisters, parted one from another by walls you must think; of
which, as also of the whole order, a scoffing Poet of those days thus
versified: Nige^. Wircker in specule stultorum.
translated by Bale in the Acts of English Votaries, out of Latin thus. The
Monks sing the Mass, the Nuns sing the other,
Thus does the Sister take part with the Brother.
Bodies, not voices, a wall does disseuer;
Without devotion they sing both together.
Again thus. What should I much prate;
An order it is begun of late,
Yet will I not let the matter so pass,
The silly Brethren and Sisters, alas
Can have no meeting but late in the dark,
And this you know well is a heavy warke.
Again of these Friars and Nuns. Some barren are of these, some fruitful be,
Yet they by name of Virgins cover all:
More fertile sure and better bears she,
Who blessed is once with croysier Pastoral:
Now scarce of them is found one barren Do,
Till age debar, whether they will or no.


The order of S. (...)
Brigide or Briget that holy Queen of Sweden, in the year 1376 did institute
the like order (as aforesaid) of Monks and Nuns, which was confirmed by
Gregory the eleventh, in the first year of his Popedom. She obtained of the
said Pope, that the Monasteries of her said order should be common as well for
men as women: yet there should be such a s^paration by walls, as the one
should have no means to come unto the other, but upon great necessity. She
would also have but one Church for both sexes, and that the Monks as Ministers
of sacred things should be below, and the Nuns above, to say their service
and prayers; but the Lady Abbess should have power to command both: yet men
should have charge of tha^ which did belong to the Divine Service, and to the
ornaments of the Church, and that there should be one amongst them that should
be called Prior, or Confessor. She also ordained, that they should have lands
and possessions whereon to live, but the superintendance to provide for all
things that should be needful, for the one and the other, as well for
victuals, as apparel, should belong unto the Abbess. That it should not be
lawful for either men or women to go out of their Monastery, without great
necessity, and then they should demand leave of the Abbess. They held the
rule of S. Augustine, with certain Articles added by this famous Queen. Some
are of opinion, that this form of Religion was first invented in Greece, but
that the Fathers had ordained, that the men should remain separated from the
women, lest they should give occasion of scandal: wherefore Saint Brigide
desiring to revive this order, she found means how without any suspicion, the
Church and house should be common to both. She ordained that they should wear
a russet habit, with a cloak of the same color, with a red cross upon their
breasts. She would have but sixty Nuns, and five and twenty Monks in
every Monastery: that is to say, thirteen Priests, according to the number of
the thirteen Apostles, comprehending Saint Paul. Then four Deacons; who might
also be Priests, and represented the four Doctors of the Church: and eight
Conue^ts, who might always be ready to labor for the affairs of the house:
so as the Friars and Nuns all together, made the number of the thirteen
Apostles, and the seventy two Disciples of our Savior: And to the end they
might be distinguished one from another, the Priests carried a red Cross upon
the left side of their cloak, under which cross they put a little piece of
white cloth, as broad as a wafer, which they offered up in reverence of the
holy Sacrament. And the four Deacons, for a difference from the Priests,
carried a round wreath of white cloth, which signified (as they gave out) the
sapience of the four Doctors, whom they represented, and upon it they put
four little pieces of red, made like unto tongues, to show that the holy Ghost
inflamed their tongues to deliver the sacred mysteries of Divinity. The
Conuerts wore a white cross upon their clokes, to show the innocence of their
lives, upon which there were five pieces of red, in commemoration of the five
wounds of our Savior.

At the dissolution there was a Covent of this Order, at Sion in Mid'e sex;
now a mansion goodly fair house belonging to the right honorable the Earl of
Northumberland.

This holy Lady Brigid died at Rome, and her daughter Katherine, Princess of
Nerice, caused the rule, after her death, to be confirmed by Po^e Vr^^^ the
fifth: She came to Rome at the age of two and forty, where she continued
eight and twenty years, she was canonized in the year of Grace 1391.

There was another S. Brigid of Ireland, far more ancient.

It is said that the image of our Savior spoke to this pious Queen of Sweden,
as she was saying her orizons before the high Altar in the Church of Saint Paul
in Via Ostiensi Rome: as appears by an inscription upon a table hanging in the
same Church, which I have seen.

As many orders, or near thereabouts, as were of Friars, so many were of
Nuns here and beyond Seas, for men in the feruencie of devotion did not
precede the weaker sex of religious women. The strictest Order of Nuns is
that of S. Clare; The poor Clares.
A Lady who lived in the same time, and was borne in the same Town of Assile
with S. Francis. Which Town to this day brags of the birth of two such worthy
persons. These Clares observe the rule of their Patron S. Francis, and wear
the like habit in color. They are never rich, and therefore to this day
wheresoever they do inhabit, they are called the poor Clares. This Saint
Clare was the first Nun of Saint Francis Order, and her Mother and Sister
undertook the same vow.

Ex lib. Fratrum Manerum Land. in bib. Cot.
Sancta Clara que in vita and in morte mirabiliter miraculis claruit. Beata
Agnes soror sancte Clare, and beata Ortulana matter eorundem fuere ordinis
Franciscorum. Saint Clare, who both in life and death was wondrously famous by
her miracles. S. Agnes her sister, and Ortulana her mother, were of the order
of S. Francis. This S. Clare, (says her Legend) touching the world was of
rightworthy and honorable lineage: Jacob. de Vora g^ne.
and, as touching the spirit to the regard of the state of virtues, and holy
manners toward God, of right noble reputation.

Hermi^es. Anchorites.
Having spoken already of such religious persons as I find to have lived here
in England in Coenobies or Couents, at the time of the general dissolution: it
remains now, to say somewhat of Hermits and Anchorites, who had at that time
their solitaire little cells or cabbins in diverse places of this kingdom,
which carry still the name of Hermitages, in and about the country, and
Anchor-holds, in Parish or Abbey Churches. They were called Hermites, or
Eremites, for that they lived solitarily in deserts and wildernesses; and
Anchorites because they lived alone without all company; immured betwixt two
walls, in the out side of some Abbey, or Parish Church, in which, by their
rule, they were to live, die, and to be buried. Whose exercise was fervent
prayer, handy labor, digging and filling up again their graves, which were to
be within their lodgings. Of the beginning and first Authors of the Hermites
life there is great question, which I leave unto the learned; and adhere to the
common received opinion, which affirms that the times of persecution were the
first cause of this kind of life. For when as in the time of Decius and
Valerianus, Emperors, about two hundred fifty and two years after Christ,
they prepared horrible torments against the Christians, many distrusting the
weakness of the flesh, and searing to deny the name of God by their
intolerable persecutions, thought it fittest to seek their safety by flight:
Wherefore many leaving Towns, fr^ends, and all their wealth, retired
themselves into deserts, and held themselves in solitary places and caves,
where they bu^lt poor cottages. Yea many times they went wandering up and down
in thick woods lest they should be taken. But when the surie of their t^ran^,
ceased, they returned not unto the world, but lived voluntarily in deserts, so
being accustomed to divine contemplation, and a quick kind of (...), they
continued in the course until death. Among the first which entered into this
course of life, was Paul of Thebes, who lived in a cave at the foot of a
rock; about the year of our redemption, 260. The second was Saint Antonie of
Egypt, who built himself a cottage upon the top of an high hill, where he
died having lived one hundred and five years, ^
in the year 34^^ S. Hierome of Stridone in Dalmatia, that learned and
religious Doct(...) the like life in the deserts of Syria, not far from
Jerusalem: In quo lo^o deserto se ieiunijs macerabat, plangebat, orabat,
sludebat, atque, etiam ^^m mentabatur. In which uninhabited place, he
macerated, or made lean, his body with fastings; he lamented and bewailed his
sins, he p^ayed* he studied, and writ certain Comments upon the sacred
Scriptures: Many other works he writ before his death, which happened about
the year of our Lord, 388.

But to come nearer home where the repute and godliness of these Hermites or
Anchorites (for both of them living from the company and conversation of men;
were called sometimes by the name of Hermites, and some other time of
Anchorites) was likewise had in venerable regard for we read that when seven
British Bishops, with other learned men of the Monas^^^^e of Bangor, ^
were to meet Austin the first Archbishop of Canterbury, concerning certain
points tending to the Catholic unity and concord, they came first (says
venerable Bede) to a certain holy and wise man, which lived thereabout an
Anchorites life, to ask his counsel, whether they ought at Austins preaching
and exhortation, to leave their traditions, or no: And we read, ^
in the said Author, that Cuthbert Bishop of Durham (enforced thereto by the
King) increasing in the merit of religious and holy devotion, came also to the
secret silence of an Anchors life and contemplation: that by prayer he brought
forth water out of a stony ground, and also received grain by the labor of
his own hands, and that out of all season of sowing.

And I have seen the Psalter translated out of Latin into English, by one
Richard a religious Hermit, In the (...) of (...) bra^e.
the antiquity whereof may be gathered by the character of the English, of
which I will give you an Essay, of certain parcels.

In the like language are all the Collects, Epistles and Gospels, for the whole
year, much what as we have them in our Church, as also the Paternoster, and
the Creed. All which by the Dialect, I guess to have been translated by this
Hermit in the days of King Henry the second, comparing them with the English
of that Pater Noster and the Creed, which Adrian the fourth Pope of Rome, an
Englishman, the son of Robert Breakespeare, Stow. Annal. (...). H. 2.
of Abbots Langley in Hertfortshire, sent to the said King Henry the second,
as follows.

Pater Noster.

This Hermit likewise translated all the Psalms of David with a gloss^ or
exposition in English upon every Pslame.

Blysfull man yat which away read naught in counc^ll of wi^ked, ^
and in ye way of sintull stud naught, and in ye chayer of pe^yleus he naught

Seldom tells us of a Psalter in that famous Bodleian Library in Oxford, ^
with a metricall translation of the Psalms, the which, as h^e is persuaded by
the character, was englished about the time of King Edward the second, where he
gives us the first Psalm as a taste of the idiom or form of our speech in
those days; which a wicked hand (says he) by cutting the first Capital left
a little imperfect.

And in the same place you may read a verse or two of the fifteenth Psalm,
thus rimed.

And ever wickes rightwisenes.
Here the more willingly (to use the words of the transcriber of these Psalms)
I have inserted these parcels of the Psalter, that by this occasion my Reader
might palliate his taste with an Essay of our Ancestors old English, as well in
the curte composition of their prose, as in the nearness of their holy
meeters, which howsoever abounding with liberty, and the character of their
times, yet have, I confess, my admiration.

And (for a conclusion) we read in Henry Archdeacon of Huntington that a
certain Anchorite, or quidam vir Dei, as he calls him, prophesied in King
Etheldreds days, that for so much as Englishm^n were given over to all
drunkenness, treason, and carelessness of Gods house, first by Danes then by
Normans, and a third time by the Scots they should be overcome. Of which I
speak elsewhere.

(...) Helen of ^^anchit^are Anchoreste.
To this retired holy Order aforesaid, women were admitted as well as men. For I
read in an old Lieger book that one I sold He^on widow (unlike in
conversation to these Anchorites I have spoken of, or the Anchores^es in the
Primitive times) made sure to King Henry the sixth, that she might be an
Anchoresse, or vowed recluse, in that part of the Abbey of Whally, anciently
ordained for that purpose; which was granted and thus confirmed.

But this religious Votaresse took no great delight in her straight lodging,
as appears by the story: for within a short time after, she being desirous of
more liberty, broke out of her cage (as other such like holy Sisters had done
before her) and flew abroad in the open world. Whereupon the Abbot and Covent
of the said Monastery, made certificate following to the King.

This Anchoresse having taken upon her so strict a vow, and being thus loose in
her life and conversation, Rob. Langland. Pass. 8.
some may very well imagine that Nuns, which had more liberty allowed them by
their rules, were far more licentious; and indeed the Author of Piers the
Ploughman speaks (in the person of the Friar Wrath) somewhat reprochfully of
his Aunt a Nun and an Abbess. As also of other like Votaresses and Votaries,
which with his introduction follows.

I am wrath, quoth he, I was sometime a Friar,
And the Couents gardener, for to graften impes,
On Limitours, and Legisters, lesings I imped
Til they bear leaves of smoth speech Lords to please;
And sithen they blosomed abrod, in bour to hear shrifte
Now is fallen, thereof a fruit that folk han well liver
Show her shrifts to hem than shriuen hem to her persons
And persons have perceived that Freres part with hem.
These possessours preach and deprave Freres
And Freres finds hem in default, as folk bear witness
And when they preach the people in many places about
I wrath walk with hom, and wish hem of my books.
Thus they speken of my spiritualty and despise each other,
Til they be both beggars and by my spiritualty libben,
Or else al rich and ^iden about, I Wrath, rest never
That I ne most follow this wicked folk, for such is my grace.
I have an Aunt to Nun, and an Abbes both,
Her had leave swone or swelt, than suffer any pain,
I have been coke in her kitchen, and her Covent served
Many months with hem, and with Monks both,
I was the Priores potager, and other pore ladies,
I made hem iowts of iangling: That Dame Ione was a bastard,
And dame Clarence a knights daughter, a cokolde was her Sire,
And dame Pernel a Priests file, Priores was she never,
For she had child in chery time, al our chapter hit wiste,
Of wicked words, I Wrath, her wortes made,
Till thou lie, and thou lie lopen out at once,
And either hit other under the cheke:
Had they had knives, by Christ, either had killed other.
Saint Gregory was a good Pope, and had good forewit
That no Priores were Priest, for that he provided
Let happily they had no grace to hold harlatry in,
For they article of her tongues and must all secrets tell.
Among Monks I might be, and many times yshamen
For they be many fell frekes my feris to epsy.
Both Prior and Subprior and our Pater Abbas;
And if I tell any tales they taken hem togethers,
And do me fast Fridayes to bread and to water.
I am challenged in chapter house as I a child were,
And balaced on the bare ars.
Thus have I spoken of all the religious Orders, which I find to have been
cloistered here in England at the time of the dissolution of Religious houses,
howsoever their number might be far more then I have spoken of. Vol. 1. pa^
236.
For. I. Fox in his Martyrologe alphabetically sets down a catalogue of an
hundred and twelve several orders of Monks, Friars, and Nuns, here and beyond
seas, whose rules were confirmed by several Popes; all branched from the four
Primitive institutions of Basil, Augustine, Benet, and Francis. Of which
increase, for a conclusion to this Chapter, as also to this discourse, one
Lelius Capilupus, a Catholic Roman in his Anatomy of the Roman Clergy,
has formerly written in Latin verse, thus not long since Englished.

But though I had an hundred tongues and more,
I could not tell how many sorts there be,
Nor show the names and orders which do flow
From this wast Sea in their posterity.
CHAP. XVII. Of the sundry ways and means by which Religious Votaries, and
others of the Clergy, enriched themselves, and other Churches Of Pardons,
Pilgrimages, and Romescot.
AL^ Churches are either Cathedral, Conuentuall, or Parochial. Cathedral, is
that Church, where there is a Bishop seated, so called, a Cathedra, the chair
or seat. Conuentuall, consists of regular Clerks, professing some order of
Religion, or of Deane and Chapter, or other College of spiritual men.
Parochial, is that which is instituted for the saying of Divine Service, and
ministering the holy Sacraments to the people dwelling within a certain
compass of ground near unto it. Of which more in the next Chapter. I will
begin with Conuentuall Churches.

As the number of Religious Orders increased, and as Religious houses were
daily more and more replenished, insomuch that the donations of their Founders
were not thought (by themselves) sufficient, they devised other means to
increase their liuelihood; and the better to maintain their high state and
comportement; and one was, by the admittance of lay people into their
Fraternities: the form whereof was after this manner following, as I have it
out of the collections of Nicholas Charles Lancaster Herald, deceased.

Amen.
I find in the golden Register of Saint Albans (a Manuscript in Sir Robert
Cottons Library) above two thousand men, women, and children, lay-persons of
the Nobility and Gentry of this kingdom, to have been thus admitted into
that one Monastery: all of which gave either lands, goods, jewels, plate,
copes, vestments, or some ornament or other to the Church and Covent.

The religious Votaries likewise, either by themselves, or their friends, gave
somewhat or other upon their first admittance into any of these Monasteries: of
which I could give many examples, but in place take one for all, I^ bib. Cot.
which I have read in the Lieger book of Saint Mary's the Nunnery at
Clerkenwell. Where Sir William de Sancto Georgio, or Saint George knight (one
of the Ancestors of Sir Richard, S. George Clarentieux now living) gives to the
Prioresse and her Sisters of the foresaid Saint Mary's Clerkenwell; with Mabell
his daughter, upon her admittance into their Nunnery, half a Verge of land in
Kingstone in Cambridgeshire. Test. Willelmo de Baus. Roberto de S. Georgio.
Roberto de Hasselingtonfeld, etc. a deed sans date.

And by another deed the said Sir William Saint George gives to the said
Priorie of Clerkenwell, for the souls health of himself, his father, his
mother, and his wife; and with Albreda his sister, who was to be a Nun of the
said house, his land in Hasselingfeld, within the foresaid County of
Cambridge, which Robert Russis held in pratis in pascuis, etc. Test. Eustac. de
Bancis, Willelmo de Bancis, Roberto de Sancto Georgio, etc.

And many others having large portions in their own possessions, out of zeal
and devotion, would give all, with themselves, to some Cloister or other, and
therein take upon them the habit of Religion. As many English do in these
days upon their admission into religious Orders beyond Seas.

They were wondrously enriched by the burials of great personages, for in
regard of burial, Abbeyes were most commonly preferred before other Churches
whatsoever: and he that was buried therein in a Friars habit, if you will
believe it, never came into hell.

Upon their visiting and confessing of the sick, they ever used some
perswasiue argument or other, that it would please the sick person to bestow
somewhat more or less (according to his or her ability) toward the
maintenance of their Fraternities, or the repairing of their Monasteries; and
that he would bequeath his body to be interred in the Church of their Covent,
with a promise that they would daily say prayers and make intercession for his
soul. They got likewise by confessing such as were in perfect health, giving
them absolution, and enioyning them penance, according as they received
gratuities. Of all which, will it please you read these passages following,
copied out of the Author of Piers Plowman, and Geffrey Chaucer. And First Piers
the Plowman, Passus vndecimus, speaking how Friars covet to bury men for their
goods.
Go confess to some Friar, and show him thy sins,
For while Fortune is thy friend Friars will the love,
And fetch the to their Fraternity, and for the beseech
To her Prior Provincial, a Pardon to have;
And pray for the pole by pole, if thou be pecuniosus.
Sed pena pecuniaria non sufficit, pro spiritualibus delictis.
I said I nolde
Be buried at their house, but at my Parish Church:
For I hard once, how conscience it told:
That kind would men be buried where they were christined.
Or where that he were Parishen that there he should be graven.
And for I said thus to Friars, a fool they me helden,
And loved me the less, for my lely speech.
And yet I cried on my confessor that held himself cunning.
That none would wed widows but for to weld her goods,
Right so by the Rode * rought you never
Where my body were buried, by so ye had my silver.
I have much marvaill of you, and so has many other
Why your Covent coueteth to confess and bury,
Rather than to baptize Barnes that be catechislinges.
And Passus decimus tertius.
Friars followed folk that were rich
And folk that were pore at little price they set.
And no cors in her kyrkeyard, nor kyrke was buried,
But quick he bequeth hem ought, or quit part of his dets.


The Friar, in Chaucer, persuading with the sick farmer, to make his
confession to him, rather to his Parish Priest, having his hand upon his
halfepennie, In the So^pners tale.
makes this request to the bedridden man lying upon his couch.

Give me then of thy gold to make our cloister,
q^oth.
Quod he, for many a muskle and many an oister,
When other men have been full well at ease,
Has been our food; our cloister for to rease.
And yet, God wot, uneath the foundament
Performed is, ne of our pauement
Is not a tile yet within our wones
By God we owen forty pound for stones.
The same Author in the Prologues to his Canterbury tales, and in the character
of the Friar, thus speaks of the absolution and easy penance they gave to men
in health, where they thought some commodity would thereby accrue to
themselves and their Covent.

Full sweetly heard he confession,
And pleasant was his absolution.
He was an easy man to give penance,
There as he wist to have a good pitaunce,
For unto a poor Order for to give,
Is a sign that a man is well yshryve:
For if he gave ought he durst make avaunt,
He wist well that a man was repentant:
For many a man is so hard of heart,
That he may not weep although him smert:
Therefore instead of weeping and prayeres,
Men mote give silver to the poor Freeres.
The Priests likewise in general as well of Cathedral, Parochial, as of these
Conuentuall Churches got much by saying of Masses; Passus vndecimus.
as it is intimated to us by Plowman in these few lines following.

If pryestes were perfect they would no silver take
For Masses, ne for Mattens, ne her meats of usurers,
Ne nether kirtle ne cote though they for cold should die.
But that which brought most riches to all the foresaid Churches, was the
Shrines, Images, and Relics, of this or that Saint, in this or that Church
especially honored and preserved; to the Visiters whereof (who with great cost
and labor did undertake so holy and devout resolution) great Indulgences and
Pardons were granted by several Popes (as will appear by the sequel) and so
semblably to their sacred Altars and other holy places: and such like
Indulgences and Pardons they were, as were anciently granted to the Churches in
Rome; which will not seem impertinent (I hope) here to set down, as I have
them out of an old book in broken English, which crept into the world in the
minority of Printing, and is commonly called, The Customs of London. But,
before I go any further, let me tell you, that Relics were ever holden in
most reverend regard, amongst all sorts of people, insomuch that in the taking
of any solemn oath, they used to lay their hand upon certain Relics, as
they did upon the holy Evangelists; For I heard that King Henry the second
being to clear himself of Archbishop Beckets death, S. Danyel in vit. H. 2.
at a general assembly holden within the City of Auranches, in the Church of
the Apostle Saint Andrew, before the two Cardinals, Theodinus and Albertus, the
Popes Legates, and a great number of Bishops, and other people, made his
purgation in receiving an oath upon the holy relics of the Saints; and upon
the sacred Evangelists, that he neither willed, nor commanded the said
Archbishop to be murdered.

The hoole Pardon of Rome granted by diverse Popes.
Videsis Onuphrium de septe^ santioribus vrbis Romae Ecclesijs.
In the cite of Rome ben iiii chirches in which is Mass daily don, but there ben
vii of the same priuileged above all the other with great holiness and Pardon, as
is here aftir shewid.

The furst is called Saint Peter's Chirch th'appostell, and is set upon the fot
of an hill, and men goo upward thertoo a steyer of xxix steps high, and as
often as a man gooth up and down that steyer, he is relesid of the seventh part
of penance enjoined and granted by Pope Alysander.

Item, as ye come before the Chirch there the well sporingeth, so may ye see

Alsoo as many times as a man gothe through the Croudes at Saint Peter's Church
he has iiii c year of pardon.

And as often as a man folowith the Sacrament to the syke bodies he has xiiii

Also Pope Siluester grauntid to all thym that daily gothe to the Chirch of
saint Peter the iii part of all his sins relesyd, and all advowes and
promise relesyd, and all sins forgeten relesyd and forgeuen, except leynge

Item, in the Church of saint Crucis there is a chamber or a chapel within,
that Pope Siluestre named Iherusalem, there is the bond that Christ was led
with to his crucifyeng, and there ben ii sausers, the one is full of Ihs blood,
and the other is full of our Ladies milk and the sponge wherein was mengyd

And one of the nails that Jesus was with on the cross, and a part of the

Item, in the same Church is a great part of one of the crosses that one of

Item, in the same Church is the tytell of Christ which that was in latin,
Ebrew, and greek, which was found in the time of Pope Innocent, to the which
the same Pope has granted great pardon.

Item, in the Church of saint Mari Mayor there stondyth on the high auter the
head of saint Iheronimus, and there ye have xiiii M. year of pardon and as many

And on the oder auter on the right hand there is the cradle that* Jesus lay

And Pope Nicholas the iiii, and saint Gregory, each of them granted thereto X

At the high auter is granted xxviii c year of pardon, and as many karynes;

that it can not be taken away.

Item, in the Church of saint Mary Mayor before written, before the quyer is the
image of our lady which seint Luke did peynt; which image saint Gregory did
bear from Mary Mayor to Saint Peter's the apostle, also coming before the castle
of Saint Angel, he see an Angel in the hight of the castle, havyng in his
hand a burninge sword, and with him a great multitude of Angels, which song
before that image* Regina celi letare, etc.
answering saint Gregory. Ora pro nobis Deum Alleluia.


Item, in the Church of saint John Latryneus, the Pope Siluestre yas thereto as
many year of pardon, as it reyned drops of water the day that hallowed the
Church.

And that time it reyned so sore, that no man had seen a greater rain before
that day.

And when he had granted this, he thought in him self whedyr he had so much
power or not.

Then there came a voice from heaven, and said Siluestre thou have power enough
to give that pardon and god granted thus much thereto; That and a man had made
a vow too Iherusalem and lacked good to do his pilgramage if he go from saint
Peter's Chirch to saint John Latrynes he shall be discharged and have absolucyon
of that promise.

And any time that a man comes to saint John Latrynes, he is quitt of all
sins and of all penance, with that, that he be penitent for his sins.

Blyssed is the mother that bears the child that heryth Mass on Saturdayes at
saint John Latrynes, for he delyvaryd all them that he desires out of
Purgatory too the nombre of lxxvii souls.

Item, upon the tour of the Chirch stondyth a double cross that was made of
the sword that saint John was beheded with, and at every time that a man
beholdith that cross he has xiiii M. year of pardon, and as many karynes of
all penance.

And at the high auter ye have remishion of all sins, and of all penance and

There is the grave that saint John laid him self in when he had said mass,
and than come a great light over the grave, and when that light was goon than
funde they no tynge there but hevynly bred. In that grave comes every good
Friday in the night ye holy cream and oil, and he that puts therein his
head has an CM. year of pardon, and as many karyns.

And behind the high auter stondith a cheyr which God sat in, and whoo that
sits therein has the iii part of all his sins relesyd.

And who that visit the all the odir aulters has at each auter xliiii C.
year of pardon, and as many karynes; and on the oon side of the Church there is
a sacryfice that is at Saint John Baptist altar, and there is the table that
our Lord ete at upon Mandy Thurrysday. And also the tables of stone with the x
Commandementys that our Lord yaf to Moses upon the mount of Synai; And there
is a iiii square of the v barley loves and of the two fishes, and also there
is our ladies keuyrchef.

Item, in that same Church on the high altar be the hedys of saint Peter and
Poule, and the head of Zachary the Prophet, fader of S. John Baptist with
diverse odyr reliquys.

Item, in the same Chirchyard stondith a chapel that is callid Sanctum
Sanctorum, there is the face of our Lord; there may ye have xiiii M. year of
pardon, and as many karynes.

When the Emperor Constantyne was christened tho spoke he to Pope Siluestre:
In that, that I have given my house to the wurschip of god, grant you mekely
his grace to all them that willingly come to this town. Thoo answered Pope
Siluestre, our Lord Ihu Criste that by his great mercy has purged you of your
great lazarye he mut purge all them that visityth this Church of all her sin
and of all other penance.

He that woll not believe this may goo to saint Latrynes before the quyer door,
and there he may see in a marbill all that is written here.

From saint John's day unto Scrouetyd all this pardon is doubled, and fro
Scrouetide unto Ester the pardon is threfolde double; Blessed is he that may
deserve to have this pardon. And in the same chapel abouesaid may come no
weemen.

Item, above that chapel on the lefre side ar stoppys which sometime ware at
Iherusalem; and who so goth op tho steppys on his knees, he deliuerith o soul
out of Purgatory.

Item, in the Chirch of Saint Eustace you may have relyse and pardon of all
sin.

And he that is shreuen and repentant of his sin he has a M. year pardon,
and as many karynes.

My Author having spoken of the Indulgences and privileges granted to these
principal Churches, and the great benefit which devout pilgrims receive which
come to visit these sacred structures, and highly reverence the holy relics
therein contained, he proceeds in this place (according to his promise) to give
his Reader knowledge what a karyne is.

A karyne (says he) is too goo wulward vii year. Item to fasten bred and
watter the Friday vii year. Item, in vii year not too sleep oon night there he
slepith a another. Item, in vii year not to com under no covered place, but if
it be to here Mass in the Chirch door or porche. Item in vii year not to ete
nor drink out of no vessel, but in the same that he made his avow in. Item,
he that fulfillyth all these poyntis vii year during; does and wynnethe a
karyne, that is to sey a Lentdum.

Thus may a man have at Rome (as he concludes) great pardon and Soul health;
blessed ben thoos pepull and in good time borne that reslayyeth these graces,
and well kepith them. Of the which pardon and grace, our Lord Ihesu Christ mot
grant to every good Christian man. Amen.

Then follow the Indulgences granted to other lower Churches in Rome: but by
these you may imagine the rest. And by both judge of the Pardons granted by
several Popes to the Cathedral, Conuentuall, and Parochial Churches of
England. And think what concourse of pilgrims and other people daily visited
the foresaid Churches; which will hereafter appear within each several
Diocese.

And here give me leave a little to speak of a certain general Pardon or
Indulgence granted by Alexander the sixth, Bishop of Rome, to this Realm of
England. By which he enriched himself, and the Church-Ministers, and emptied
the purses of many of the Kings subjects.

Toward the latter end of the year, one thousand five hundred, being the
year of Iubile (so called, for that it is the year of joy or deliverance) the
foresaid Bishop of Rome sent hither to King Henry the seventh, one Jasper Powe
or Pons, The great pardon, or Heavenly Grace.
a Spaniard, a man of excellent learning, and most civil behavior, to
distribute the Heavenly Grace (as he termed it) to all such as (let by any
forcible impediment) could not come to Rome that year to the Iubile which was
there celebrated. The Articles contained in the Bull of this great Pardon, or
Heavenly Grace, were as follows.

The Articles of the Bulle of the holy Iubiley of full remissyon, Copied out of
an old Roll, now in the custody of Sir Simon D'Ewes Knight.
and great joy granted to the Relme of England, Wales, Irelond, Gernesey, and
Garnesey, and other places under the subjection of our Soueraygne Lord King
Henry the seventh to be distributyd according to the true meaning of our holy
Fader unto the Kings Subjects.

Ower most holy Fader the Pope, Gods Vicar in earth, of his holy and
gracyous disposycion, faderla beholding the hole flok of christen people
committed to his cure and charge, daily studyeth diligently the health and
welfar of yowr sowles: And in as much as in his holiness prouydeth for all
soche perelles and ieoperdies as may fall to the same, by grauntyng of great
Indulgence, and remishyon of sins and trespasses.

Where as the holy year of grace now of late passyd, that is to say, the year
of remishyon of all sins, ye year of joy and gladness, was celebrate
devowtely, and solenly keped, by great and infenite nombre of Christian pepull in
the Cowrte of Rome. Ower said most holy Fader the Pope, as well considering
the infenite nombre of christian people both spyrituall and temporal which was
desirous to have had the said remishyon and Grace, and would have visetted the
said Cowrte of Rome, save only that they were let, either by sikenesse,
feblenesse, pouerte, long distance, and great ieoperdie; or besines and charges
of spiritual or temporal occupacions, or at that time purposed not to optaine
and perchase the said Grace, and now be in will and desire to have the same. As
willing, and effectually desiring to provide and withstond the most cruel
purpose, and infenyte malice of our most cruel enemies of our christian feithe
the Turks which continually studieth, and gretely inforceth himself with all
his might and strenght to subvert and utterly destroy the holy Religion of
our Sovereign Criste. As it is not unknown how now of late, the said most
cruel enemy has opteyned and gotten with great might and power many and diverse
great citees and castles; As Modon, Neopo^ton, and Corona, with many oder
Towns and possessions which was than in the dominatyon and possession of
christian people. And most cruelly has sleyne and ^estroyed infenite nombre of
christian people withowt mercy or pite, both by water and by land. Seeing and
considering his Holiness, that he of himself is not sufficyent, ne of power to
resist, and withstonde the foresaid great malyces, and porposes, without the
aid and help of christian people; Has statu^ed, ordained, and granted of his
Pastoral power, as is contained in these Articles following.

The Articles of the Bull of dispensacyon with Simony, Usury, and of goods
wrongfully keped; reserved to the Commissary only.
Moreover ower seid holy Fader the Pope willing more largely to provide for
the health and welfar of the sowles of all christian pepull dwelling or abiding in
the Relme and places above written; has given, and granted, full auctorite,
and power, to the said Venerable Fader in God, Gaspar Pow^ his Orator and
Commissary, to absolve, and dispense with all manner of persons, dwelling or
abidyng within the said Relme, or places above rehersyd, men or women, of what
degree or condicyon so ever they be, spirytuall or temporal, seculer or
reguler, which has committed Symony, in gevyng or recevyng holy Orders, or
Benefices spiritual or any other wai^s; that they may, notwithstondyng the said
Simony so commyttid ministre in the orders so receyved: And the Benefices so
obtained lawfully keep and occupye, and the fruits or to be receyved, occupy
and despose at their pleasure. And if the said persons by reason thereof have
run into irregularite; as there upon syngyng Mass, or oder wise ministryng
the holy Sacramentys of the Church: The said Commissary has full power to
despence with that irregularite; and to take away all infamye and unableness
which they be in by reason of the same. Always provided that the said persons
make a composytyon hereof with the said Commissarie, and soche money as they
compownd for, effectually to pay to the said Commissarie, to be spent in this
holy use for the relefe and defense of our feith.

Also the said Commissarie has power to compownd, absolve, and dispense with
all those that occupye evil gotten goods; all usurers, and all soche that
wrongfully and vnlefully occupies or witholdeth oder mennys goods by fyndyng;
or goods hid not knowing, or dowtyng who be the owners of the said goods, or
to whom they should make restitucyon, that they lefully keep, and occupy the
same goods. Furst making composycyon for the same with the said Commyssarie, of
some certain sum of money to be spent in the foreseyd holy use, that is to
sey, for the relefe and defense of ower Feith, against the most cruel and
bitter enemies of the same, the Turks.

Also if there be any willing to be created Doctor in both Laws, or in one of
them; the said Commissarie has power to do it, as well as if he were created
in any University: And so of oder degrees, etc.

Also this Pope by his Bulls imparted this his blessing and benefit of the
Iubeley to all other kingdoms and territories under his spiritual
Iuris^iction and obeisance, and to all in like manner, and upon the like
conditions. By which you may gather, that this beneuolent liberality of pardon
and heavenly Grace, was not altogether freely given by the Pope; neither was
that mass of money, thus co^gested together, spent in any wars against the
Turks, as he promised; but conveyed to Rome, and there laid up in his own
Treasury: whilst the enemies of the faith did greatly infest the Christians.
But this Pope of all other, in my judgment, had the most shameful and cunning
shif^s to get money withal, and was more opprobrious in all his actions then
any other either before or since. But as he lived wickedly, so he died
miserably, being poisoned with the same bane which he had prepared for
another. Actius Sannazarius, and other writers of that age made certain
Epitaphs of him to his eternal in^amie. Which I find thus translated into
English, out of Io. Bale in his Pageant of Popes.

Perhaps whose Tomb this is (my friend) ye do not know,
Then pause a while if that ye have no haste to go.
Though Alexanders name upon the stone be graven,
It Is not that great, but he that late was Prelate shorn and shaven.
Who thirsting after blood, devoured so many a noble Town,
Who tossed and turned the ruthful states of kingdoms vpside down.
Who to enrich his sons, so many Nobles slew,
And wast the world with fire and sword and spoiling to him drew.
Defying laws of earth and heaven, and God himself erewhile,
So that the sinful Father did the Daughters bed defile.
And could not from the bands of wicked wedlock once refrain,
And yet this pestilent Prelate did in Rome ten years remain.
Now friend remember Nero, or else Caligula his vice;
Or Heliogabalus: enough: the rest ye may surmise,
For shame I dare not utter all. Away, my friend, with this.
Another.

The Spaniard liethe here that did all honesty defy,
To speak it briefly: in this Tomb all villainy does lie.
Another.

Lest Alexanders noble name, my friend, should thee beguile,
Away: for here both treachery does lurk, and mischief vile.
Another.

Though Alexander after death did vomit matter black,
Yet marvel not: he drank the same, and could not cause it pack.
Upon the year of Iubelie aforesaid kept by this Pope Alexander*
The Roman Priest that promised both heaven and stars to sell,
By treachery and murtherings has made a gap to hell.
This Alexander before (by deuillish means) he obtained the Papacy, was
called Rodericus Borgia, a Spaniard borne in Valentia. But of him enough,
except it tended more to the matter. Now may it please you read certain
blanke verses taken out of my fore remembered Author, Piers Plow man, who
speaks in his language of the Pope and Cardinals, Pardons and pilgrimages
effectually to this purpose. Passus 19.

God amend the Pope, that pilleth holy Kirk
And claymeth before the King to be kept of Christen Of the Pope.

And counts not though christian be killed and robbed
And find folk to fight, and christen folk to spill.
Again the old law and new law as Paul thereof witnesses.
Non occides, mihi vindictam, etc.
I ne knew never Cardinal that he ne come fro the Pope,
And we Clarks when they come for her Commens payen, Of the Cardinal^

For her pelures, and palfreis, and pilors that hem follow.

The country is the curseder that Cardinals commen in.
And there they lig, and leng more lechery there reigns
Therefore, quod this victory, by very god I would
That no Cardinals ne come among the commen people,
But in her holiness helden hem still
At Avion among the Jews; cum sancto sanctus eris,
Or in Rome as their rule will the relikes to keep.
In the seventh passage he delivers his opinion of the Popes Pardons, in these
words. The Priest preued no pardon to do well, ^

And demed that Dowell Indulgence passed

And how Dowell at the day of dome is ^

And passed all the Pardon of S. Peter's Church.

Pilgrimage what it is.
Pilgrimage, is called of the Latins, Peregrinatio, quasi peregre abitio, a
going into a strange country; for a short pilgramage is not worth a pin:
neither is that Image in so much honor or respect in that country where it
is, as in far countries. For example, the Italians, yea those that dwell
near Rome, will mock and scoff at our English (and other) pilgrims that go
to Rome to see the Popes holiness, and Saint Peter's chair, and yet they
themselves will run to see the Relics of Saint James of Compostella in the
kingdom of Galicia in Spain, which is above twelve hundred English miles. And
so the Spaniards hold Rome to be a very holy place, and therefore spare no cost
or labor to go thither. And so of other pilgrimages.

Pilgrimage was also called Romeria, quia Romam vt plurimum peregrinationes,
because pilgrimages forth most part were made to Rome.

Now having acquainted my Reader (omitting many particulars, I confess, which
will more plainly appear in the sequel) by what devises and means, the
Religious Votaries and others of the Clergy within this kingdom, as also the
Bishop of Rome (who most commonly went away with the best share) augmented
their revenues, and deceived the poor Commons. I am here to speak of a
yearly tribute paid only to the Sea of Rome (which many times I obuiously
meet withal) from the payment whereof, neither the King nor the Clergy, nor
any householder (...) in England or Ireland were privileged, and this was
called (...) which is a Saxon word compounded of Rome and Scot, as you wou^d
say, the (...) bute due to Rome, ^
or an Apostolical custom, or the sea of (...) penning, or Denarij Sancti
Petri, Peter pence: From which payment (...) Matthew the Monk of Westminster,
neither the King, nor the Archbishop, Bishop, Abbot, nor Prior, were exempted.
I he first ^ounder of (...) Tribute was Inas, or Ina, king of the West Saxons.
Of which the foresaid Matthew thus writes.

Ina the pious and potent king of the West Saxons, lea^ing his temporal
kingdom (thereby to gain an eternal) to the government of his kinsman
Ethelard, ^
trauel^ed on pilgrimage to Rome, where in the said City by the permission of
Gregory the second, he built an house which he called, The English School;
unto which, the kings of England, and the Regal Image, as also Bishops,
Priests, Clerks, and others might repair, to ^ee instructed in good
literature, and in the Catholic faith; lest that any thing in the English
Church might be sin^ste^ly expounded contrary to the universal unity, and so,
being established in the orthodoxall and right received Faith, they might
return back again into their own country. For the doctrine and Schools of
the English Nation since the time of Archbishop Austin, had been interdicted
by diverse Romish Bishops, for certain heresies which daily appeared after the
coming in of the Saxons into Britain, by reason of the commixture of the
misbeleeuing wicked Pagans, with the Christians of holy conversation. He also
caused a Church to be erected near to the foresaid house or College, which he
dedicated to the honor of the blessed Virgin Mary; in which such of the
English as came to Rome might celebrate d^uine Service, and that therein, if
any of the said English there happened to depart this world, they might be
in^erred. And all these, that they might for ever be more firmly corroborated,
it was ordained by a general decree, throughout all the kingdom of the
West Saxons, that in every family one penny should be yearly collected and
sent over to blessed Saint Peter and the Church of Rome, which in English
Saxons was called Romescot; that the English there abiding mig^t by that mean
have sufficient to live upon. Thus ^a^re Matthew of Westminste^ surnamed the
Flower-gatherer. The which in substance is thus deliuer^d by a late writer, yet
in a different manner.

He (meaning Ina) instituted also a certain yearly payment to the Sea of
Rome, ^
enioyning every one of his Subjects that posses^ed in his house of one kind
of goods to the value of twenty pence, that he should pay a p^ny to the Pope
yearly upon Lammas day; which at that time was contributed under the name of
the Kings Alms, but afterward was called and challenged by the name of
Peter Pence.

Another of the same gift by the said King has these times.

He gave to Rome each year ^

The Rome pence thorrow West sex all about
Perpetually to be well paid and clear,
For unto Rome he went without all doubt.
After the example, and with the like zeal of Ina, Offa the most magnificent
king of the Mercias, in great devotion went also to Rome, and made every house
within his territories subject to this payment of Romescot; Hand. cap. 133.
Ossa gave through Mers the Rome penny
Unto the Church of Rome.


Afterward about the year eight hundred and fifty, this tribute was
confirmed, and made further payable throughout all England; For Ethelwolfe (as
then being sole Monarch of the Englishmen; (having been sometimes for certain
years (as Haneden and Brampton write) Bishop of Winchester) remembering his
Ecclesiasticke profession; and ordaining first that tithes and lands due to
holy Church should be free from all tributes and Regal services; in the
nineteenth year of his reign, with the like devotion of the two former kings,
went in pilgrimage, taking with him his youngest son Alfred, or Elfred, to
the foresaid chief City of the Romans; where he was both honorably
received and entertained by the Bishop of Rome and the whole Senate, for the
space of one year and upwards: in which time he rebuilt the English School
before remembered, which lately had been almost quite consumed with fire. ^
And in lieu of his kind entertainment, confirmed the former grant of
Peter Pence, causing it to be paid throughout all his Dominions; and further
couenanted to pay yearly to Rome three hundred Marks, thus to be employed;
one hundred to Saint Peter's Church, another hundred to Saint Paul's light, and
the third to the Pope (a Saint that evermore will have his share) to the
intent, says one, that no Englishmen should do penance in bounds, as he saw
some do before his face. This Athilwolfe to Rome took his way
In pilgramage with him his son Aelfrede,
To Peter and Pole he granted infenitife
The Rome pence of all England.
As Flores says as I con understand.
Says Harding, cap. 105.

And further to confirm the premises, may it please you to trouble your
patience in the reading of these following hard rimes transcribed out of a
namelesse old Author.

A Manuscript in the Library of Edmond Cotton ^^pti^e.
Adelwolfe his son at Chester his cite
For all his kings and Barons of estate
Sent forth anon at his parliament to be
Whycheatte Chester was than preordynate
To which al came, both Kings, Duks, and Prelat
And odar al of honor or Empryse
Him for to do obeysaunce and servysse.
anon to Room he went
In pilgrimage with holy good intent.
Where he was so abydyng full too yer
In holy lyff and full perfactyon.
In ryall wise as to a pryns afer
And to the Pope with full affectyon
His comonyng ay had at his electyon.
He gave to Peter light
And to Sent Poule, wha^ is full great repayr
Too thousand mark of Venyse gold full right
For sustenaunce of the Chyrches right.
He Busschopp was in his Fadars day
And for defaut of heyr was crownyd king
Wharfor when he his land in good array
Fre of servysse had set above all thing
He grauntyd tithe of all his land ofspryng
Till three persons dwelling in unity
Why charr on God dwelling in Trynite.
And Room pens he grant unto the Pope
Perpetuelly to have of al England.
So perfytt was his mind who couth hit grope
In all goodness growndyd I vndyrstond.
Through al his might in all his noble land,
The Piece he kept, and in his Se iudicyall
The common Law among his people all.
Edgar king of England made sharp constitutions for the payment of this
Tribute.

And it was one of the laws of Edward the Confessor, ^
that every householder which had triginta denariatas viuae pecuniae in domo
sua de proprio suo, Thirty pence of ready money, or of any kind of cattle in
his house of his own proper, should by the Law of the English give a penny to
Saint Peter, and by the Law of the Danes half a mark; which penny was to be
demanded at or upon the feast of Saint Peter and Paul, and to be collected
before the feast of Saint Peter ^
ad vincula, and not to be deferred to any further day: And if any withheld the
payment thereof any longer time, complaint was to be made to the Kings
Officers, for that this penny was the Kings Alms. And that the party so
offending, should he constrained by justice to make payment thereof, on pain
of forfeiting his goods. Now if any man had more dwelling houses then one, he
was to pay only for that house where he should happen to be resiant, at the
said feast of Saint Peter and Paul.

Henry the second upon his conquest of Ireland, imposed this tribute upon that
kingdom, only to curry favor with the Pope, who as then was Adrian the
fourth, called before his inthronization, Nicholas Breakespeare, borne at
Abbots Langley in Hertfordshire. For he (says Speed in the life of the said
Henry) knowing how great and dangerous tumults the Popes had raised upon small
occasions, thought his way would be much easier, ^
if he went onward with the Popes good favor, which he easily obtained for a
fee, viz. a penny yearly to be paid to Saint Peter of every house in
Ireland.

Edward the third in the 39. year of his reign (says Treuisa the Continuer
of Polychronicon) ordained, that this Tribute of Peter pence, should not be
from thenceforth any more gathered within this Realm, nor any such payment
made at Rome. But howsoever (says Hollinshed in the said year) this payment
was abrogated at this time, by King Edward, it was after rene^ed again by the
Pope, and the money was gathered in certain Shires of this Realm, until the
days of king Henry the eighth.

Parsons, and Impropriators of Churches, at this day in many places of England,
are paid this penny under the name of a Smoke penny.

This Chapter is grown much longer then I expected. Of which an end.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Parishes, Bishoprics Of the power and sanctity of Bishops
and Priests. Of Sanctuaries, and of the Eccles^asticall state of England and
Wales.
(...) Angel. (...).
PArochia dicit^r locus in quo degit populus alicui Ecclesiae baptismali
deputatus, and certis finibus limitatus.

A Parish is said to be a place in which people do hue assigned to some
Christian Church, and limited by certain bounds.

^
Euaristus the first, Bishop of Rome, who suffered martyrdom under Traian the
Emperor, about the year of our redemption, one hundred and ten, ordained
Curates, and disposed of them to certain places, that they might administer
the Sacraments to such people as were committed to their charge; and withal he
ordained that these Curates should be nourished and maintained by those people
of whose souls they had the cure; whereupon they were called, Parochi (...) a
prebenco, vel a mutua alimentorum praebitione, Parochians, or Parishioners of
the mutual exhibition, and giving of nourishment one to another; the Priest
for the souls of his people, and the people for the maintenance of their
Priest.

^
Dionisius, that blessed Martyr, Bishop of Rome, circa ann. 266. did attempt to
do the like throughout the whole Christian world, appointing by distribution
certain places, to which he assigned Ecclesiastical persons, there to
administer the Sacraments, pray, and preach the word, and to receive the tenths
of the possessions contained within the limits of the foresaid places.

^
Honorius Archiepiscopus Cantuar* circa annum a salute reparata 636. Angliam
primus in Parochias distribuere cepit.

Honorius Archbishop of Canterbury, about the year of our salvation, 636.
began first to divide England into Parishes.

(...). cap. 9.
But this opinion is controuerted by a late learned Antiquary, and by him
plainly approved, that Honorius was not the first that made this division here
in England, but that Parishes were divided, and Parish-Churches built long
before his time; even in the Primitive Hierarchy of the Britaine^. And that in
the time of King Arthur, about the year of our Lord 490 when Dubritius was
made Archbishop of South Wales, diverse Churches with their endowments of
Tithes, oblations, and other profits, were appropriated to him the said
Dubritius, and his successors. And that in those times Churches were built
here no doubt can be made. Neither is it to be conceived how Christianity
could be in any nation, says my Author, much ancienter (if generally received,
or by any number) then Churches, or some convenient houses, or other places in
the nature of Churches, appointed for the exercise of devotion. ^
And express mention is made of a Church (of which I have spoken before) built
in Canterbury in the time of the Romans, to the honor of Saint Martin, in
which Augustine and his followers when they came first from Rome, made their
holy assemblies.

After that the storms of Diocletians persecution were ouerblowen, says Bid,
Lib. 1. cap ^.
which was circa Ann. 290. the faithful Christians, who in time of danger lay
hid in dens and deserts, came forth, and showed themselves abroad, renewed
their Churches, which before were overthrown flat to the ground, founded,
builded, and perfited new Temples, in honor of the holy Martyrs, celebrated
holy days, consecrated the holy mysteries, with pure mouth and heart, and
every where as it were displayed their ensigns in sign of Conquest.

Aliquindo Parochia dicitur totus Episcopatus, Sum. Angl. lit. P. Will. Malms.

says one, and Parochia etiam Dioecesis Episcopalis dicitur, says another.
Sometime a Parish is said to be the whole Bishopric, and sometime the
Episcopal Diocese.

Kenwalch King of the West Saxons, ^
divided, In duas Parochias Pra^^nciam; the Province into two Parishes, or
Diocesses, when as he erected a new Bishopric at Winchester, taken out of the
Diocese of Dorchester, a ruinous Town now in Oxfordshire.

In the year 680. ^
Merciorum Prouincia in quinque Parochias est diuisa: The Province of Mercia
was divided into five Parishes, that is, into five Bishoprics; and thus
Honorius may be said properly to have been the first under whom his Province
was divided into such Parishes or Bishoprics.

Anno Dom. 747. in the reign of Ethelbald, Will. Malms. de gest. Pont. lib.
king of the Mercians, in a Synod holden at Clouesho, it was decreed, Vt
singuli Episcopi omni anno Parochias suas circumirent: That every Bishop should
go about or visit his Parishes once every year.

And in the first Synod or Convocation of the English Church, Bed. l 4. ca. 5.
holden at Hereford, Ann. 670, it was determined, Vt nullus Episcoporum
Parochiam alterius inuadat, sed contentus sit gubernatione creditae sihi
plebis: That no Bishop should have ought to do in another Parish, but be
contented with the charge of the people committed unto him.

Kenulph, Will. Malms. de g^stis Reg li. 1. c. 4.
King of the Mercians, in his Epistle to Leo the third, Bishop of Rome, writes,
Quod contra Canones a Patre Gregorio constitut as auctoritas Dorobernensis
Metropolitani in duas scinditur Parochias, cuius ditioni duo decim subiacere
debent Episcopi. That contrary to the Canons of Saint Gregory the jurisdiction
of the Metropoliticall See of Canterbury was divided into two Parishes, to
whose authority twelve Bishops ought to be subject. To which point of his
Epistle, Leo makes this answer. In sacro scrinio nostro reperimus, sanctum
Gregorium Predecessorem nostrum in integro ipsam Parochiam numero duodecim
beato Augustino Archiepiscopo tradidisse Epis copos consecrandos. We find in
our sacred Cabinet, our Predecessor Saint Gregory, to have given and delivered
that Parish to blessed Augustine entire and whole, with the number of twelve
Bishops by him to be consecrated.

These great Parishes or Bishoprics were not made Diocesses or Jurisdictions
together, straight from the first budding of Christianity, but in succession
of time, as the number of Christians did increase, and as the true faith was
spread abroad. For some Churches were under the charge of Curates, other some
of Abbots, and of these were made these great Parishes or Bishoprics. The
dignity and government of which was appointed to learned and religious men,
which did diligently ouersee, like good Shepherds, the flocks committed to
their charge, and these were called Bishops.

Numma. Angelica lit. E.
Episcopus Greece, latin speculator interpretatur, speculari enim debet mores
and vitia populi sibi subiecti and intendere ad eorum salutem. A Bishop both in
Greek and Latin, signifies a beholder, or a Scoute* watch, for he ought to
behold and ouersee the manners, conditions, and vices of the people living
under his government, and to use the best means he can for their souls
health.

fight and make war after the same manner as they be commanded by their
Captain our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Omnis Pontifex (says Saint Paul) ex hominibus assumptus, pro hominibus

men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
for sins.

Lib. 1.
What is more pleasant (says William the Monk of Malmesbury in his Prologue to
the Acts of our English Bishops) then to rehearse the praise of our ancient
Bishops; that thou may know the deeds of them of whom thou have received the
rudiments of Faith, and the incitements to a godly life.

No nation of the world, says Capgraue, in the Prologue to his Catalogue of
English Saints, Io Cap
has from the beginning been so blessed with holy, learned, and religious
Bishops as England, whose sanctity did so shine, that all which saw them and
their good works, assuredly knew, that they were the seed, to whom God had
imparted his blessings: their conversation and study being always about
heavenly matters.

As the rod of Aaron did bud and blossom, Numb. ^^.
and bring forth ripe Almonds, so the Church and Ministry of England, by the
means of our reverend Bishops, as of Gods sacred instruments, did (and still
does) prosper, flourish, and bring forth fruits of righteousness, to the
glory of God, and comfort of all true Christian hearts.

Now before I conclude this point, Of the first in(...) of ^ishop^.
give me leave to speak a little further of the first institution of Bishops
out of the book of a namelesse Author, written in Latin about three hundred
years since; translated into English by one William Marshall, and imprinted at
London by one Robert Wyer, Ann. 1535 in the 27. of King Henry the eighth, the
book is called, The Defense of Peace.

After the times of the Apostles, D^fence of Pe^ce. Chap. 1^.
the nombre of Priests being notablye augmented, and increased (says he) to
avoyde sclaundre and occasyon of offendynge any man, and to avoyde scisme and
dyvysion, the Priests chose one among themselves, which should dyrecte and
order the other, as touching to the exercysynge of the Ecclesiastical office,
or service, and the dystrybutyng of the oblacyons, and the dysposynge and
ordering of other things in the most convenient manner, N^t^. for our t^^s.
lest if every man might do this thing after his own pleasure, as he lest
himself, the good order and servyce of the Churches might be troubled, by the
reason of the diverse affeccions of men. This Preeste which was so elected and
chosen, to order and rule the other Priests, by the custom and used manner of
speaking of them that came afterward, was only called a Bishop or ouerseer;
because not only he was ouerloker of the Christen people* for which cause all
other Preests also were called Overseers in the Prymatyne Church; but also
because he had the ouersyght of the other Priests. Howsoever, says he, in the
same Chapter, in the essentyall and inseparable auctoryte and dygnyte of
Preesthood; the Bishops have no pre-eminence above other Priests, but only
in auctoryte accydentall, being that the Bishop by the provydence of God is
chosen (upon the former reason) to have the rule and government of the Clergy
within his Diocese: For in the power and auctoryte of making and admynystryng
the Sacraments, and performing of other duties belonginge merely to the
Preesthood, all Priests (says he) have all one auctoryte in kind: neither
the Bishop of Rome, or any other Bishop has this auctoryte any whyt more
largely, than any other has who ever he be, being called a simple or pryvate
Priest. And therefore it is to be mervayled, wherefore some men do stryve
styffely and frowardly affyrmynge yet no thing reasonably, that the Pope of
Rome has more large power of the keys given to him of Christ than has other
Priests, Every Priest has as much power in binding and loosing as the Pope.
seeing that this cannot be proved by the holy Scripture, but rather the
contrary. For which things, to go on with my Author, more evidently to be
seen and perceyved, you ought to understand and know, that these two words
Presbyter, and Episcopus, that is to say, Priest or senyour, and Bishop, were
both of one sygnyfycacion, and betokened all one thing in the Prymatyue
Church, albeit they were put to sygnyfy one thing of diverse propertyes, for
Presbyter was a name gyven to them of age, which is as much to say as a
Senyour or Elder. And Episcopus was a name given of cure or charge upon other,
and is as much to say as an ouerloker, according to that of Saint Iherom in a
certain Epistle to Euandre, who says thus, Presbyter and Episcopus, the one
is a name of age, the other of dygnyte.

These dignified priests, I mean Bishops, ever since the Conquest, their
chief seat or chair in Cities, and their Churches have, ever since the
sunshine of the Gospel, been called Cathedral* and in respect they were
more spacious then other inferior Parish Churches, Camd. in Epis. D^^^.
they were termed Basilicae, of which will it please you hear Camden speak.
These greater Churches (says he) when the saving light of Christ shone upon
the world were termed Basilicae, for that the Basilicae of the Gentiles which
were large and spacious Hauls, wherein Magistrates sat in judgment, and
ministered justice, were converted into Christian Churches. Whence Ausonius
wrote thus. Basilica olim negotijs plena, etc. The Basilica (or Haul of
Justice) in times past full of businesses, is now as full of prayers and vows:
or else because they were built in form somewhat long in manner of those
Basilicae.

But to return back again to my Parishes, which are called Benefices for
Ecclesiastical persons, like as the preferments in Cathedral Churches are
termed Church Dignities: and of these, some are called Rectories, or
Parsonages, some Vicaradges, as will appear by the sequel.

Parochia is sometime called Plebania, and thus defined.

Sintagiutis lib 1^. cap. 24.
Plebania est aliud genus beneficij, et maius quam Rectoria, habet sub se
Capellas et dignitatem esse putant interpretes.

Plebania is another kind of Benefice, and of greater circuit then a
Rectorie; it has under it certain Chapels, and this Plebania, or dignitas
plebeia is said to be a Church dignity, by Interpretours.

Questionless these Plebanians were like our side-wasted Parishes in
Lanchishire, whose extensure is so large, that (to my own knowledge) some one
of those Parish Churches has fourteen Chapels of ease (as we call them)
within the circumference of her limits, The Parish of Whalley in Lanchishire.
and as it were under her jurisdiction, all which are honored with Parochial
rites.

Cathedral, Abbey and Parish Churches had great privileges of sanctuary
granted unto them in former times. Sanctuaries.
Now a Sanctuary is a place of refuge for offenders to escape punishment. And
these Sanctuaries were so called of an old Mosaicall rite used amongst the
Israelites, among whom every Tribe had certain Cities, and places of refuge,
to which malefactors might repair, and for a time be protected from the
rigor of the Law. Of which you may read in the sacred writ: Exodus 21.13.
Numb. 35.1. Deuter. 4.41. and Josh. 20.2. And so likewise here in great
Britain Churches, Churchyards, Cities, ploughs and highways, had many
privileges in this kind anciently granted and confirmed unto them. I will
speak first of the last out of a late Writer, who makes old Watling-streete
thus to sing his verse.

Since us his kingly ways Mulmutius first began
From (...) ^gaine ^o Sea, M. Dr^yton ^oly^l. Song 16.
that through the Hand ran.
Wh(...)at in m^nd to keep Posterity might have,
Appo^nting ^ust his course, this privilege he gave,
That no man might arrest, or debtors goods might seize
In any of us four his military ways.
Near five hundred years before this King Mulmutius (take it upon the credit
o^ the British Story) constituted diverse laws; Se^de^ in his Illustrations
upon the (...) verses.
especially that Churches, Ploughs, and high ways should have liberties of
Sanctuary, by no authority violable. That Churches should be free, and enjoy
liberty for refuge, consenting allowance of most Nations have tolerated, and
in this kingdom (it being affirmed also by constitution of King Lucius a
Christian) every Church yard was a Sanctuary, until by Act of Parliament under
Hen. 8. that license, for protection of offenses, being too much abused, was
taken away.

Of Mulmutius Dunwallo (for so he is sometime called) and his privileges to
sacred places, my old Mss. thus further speaks.

A king there was in Brutayne Donw^lle was his nam, Ro^. Christ

Stale worth, and hardy a man of great fam.
He ordained first yat thieves yat to Temple slown were
No man were so hardy to do hem despit there;
That has be much suth yhold as hit begone tho,
Hely Church hit holdyth yut and wole ever mo.
Hereupon he called the Temples which he built, the Temples of peace and
concord: one of which was in London, where now Blackwell Hall is, another in
Fleete-street, as yet called the Temple Church, wherein (or in some of them)
himself, Gorbomannus, and other of the British kings, were interred, as by
supposition it is delivered.

Lucius, Fl^res. Hist. p^. ^og de (...) ^^un. 183.
king of the Britains, having abundantly distributed and given ample
possessions, and revenues to Churches and Clergy men, ordained that Churches
with their Coemiteries or Churchyards, should have this privilege; that what
malefactor soever should thither make flight for his safety, he might there
remain without indemnitie.

Ethelwolfe and Alfred Kings of the West Saxons, gave the like important
privileges to these holy Edifices.

Athelstane sole Monarch of the Englishmen, ^eg. A^fr^^i. c. 5.
held the memory of John de Beuerley, Archbishop of York, so sacred and
reverend (for he honored him as his ^urelar Saint) that he endowed Beuerley
(the place of the said Archbishops birth) with many, Camd. in Yorkshire.
and those very great privileges, and granted them liberties in these general
words. As free make I thee
As heart may think, or eye may see.
Yea and there was granted unto it the privilege of a Sanctuary, so that
Bankrupts and men suspected of any capital crime, worthy of death, might be
free and safe there from the danger of the law; in which was erected a chair
of stone with this Inscription.

This seat of Stone is called Freed stool, that is, the chair of peace, unto
which what offender soever flies, and comes, has all manner of Security.

Of the Sanctuary at Westminster, first granted by Sebert King of the
East Saxons, increased by Edgar King of the West Saxons, and confirmed by the
Charter of King Edward the Confessor, I have spoken before.

In Leg. Will. Con. Reg. de Houeden.
If any one guilty of offense fly from any place for refuge to the Church,
Church-doore, to the Parson or Vicars house, or into any part of his base or
inner Court (provided that the said house and courts be within consecrated
ground) it shall not be lawful for any to take him from thence, save only the
Bishop or some of his Officers. Now if this malefactor be a filching knave,
or an highway robber, and be taken with the booty, or if his theeuish
purchase be altogether exhausted and spent, yet if he have any means
otherwise of his own, he shall make satisfaction to the party, or parties
whom he has so wronged; and if he still continue to play the thief, and
make a custom of this manner of flight to Churches and Priests houses, after
restitution made, he shall abjure the country; and if he give not satisfaction
to the parties, whose goods he has taken and purloyned, no man shall dare to
give him lodging or entertainment, without the kings special license first
obtained.

Bracton sol. 132
If a Clergie-man be taken for felony, delivered to the Ordinary, and break
prison, and fly to the Church for sanctuary or refuge, he shall be taken
from thence, and put into the same prison out of which he escaped; for the
Church ought not to defend him, nor any public malefactor, Si ad pacem Regis
venire noluerit.

But stay, for if robbing from other men's works, to embellish my own writings,
be an offense, it is high time for me to take Sanctuary: yet give me leave to
go a little further in my course, and to speak somewhat, out of other Authors,
of the Ecclesiastical state of England, of which you may read more at large
in Camden his division of Britain, and know more by Speed in his Type of this
flourishing kingdom.

Sir Edward C^ke in his Comment. upon Littleton. lib. 2. cap. 6.
The Ecclesiastical state of England is divided into two Provinces or
Archbishopricks; viz. of Canterbury, and of York. The Archbishop of Canterbury
^s styled, Metropolitanus et Primas totius Angliae; and the Archbishop of
York, Primas Angliae. The Archbishop of Canterbury has under him within his
Province, of ancient and late foundations. Rochester his principal Chaplain;
London his Deane; Winchester his Chancellor, and all the rest of the
Bishoprics, four excepted, viz. Chester, Durham, Carlisle, and the I Will of Man,
which are annexed to the Archbishopricke of York.

Every Diocese is divided into Archdeaconries, and the Archdeacon is called
Oculus Episcopi, The eye of the Bishop. And every Archdeaconrie is parted into
Deanries, and Deanries again into Parishes, Towns, and Hamlets.

The Bishop is called the Ordinary, in the Ecclesiastical Law. Quia habet
ordinariam iurisdictionem in iure proprio, et non per deputationem: for that he
has ordinary jurisdiction in his own proper right, and not by deputation, in
causes Ecclesiastical.

All the Archbishops and Bishops of England have been founded by the Kings of
England; and do hold of the King by Baronie, and have been all called by writ
to the Court of Parliament, and are Lords of Parliament.

And the Bishoprics in Wales, were founded by the Princes of Wales; and the
Principality of Wales was holden of the King of England, as of his Crown. And
the Bishops of Wales are also called by Writ to Parliament, and are Lords of
Parliament as Bishops of England be.

There were within the Realm of England one hundred and eight^ene Monasteries,
founded by the Kings of England, whereof such Abbots and Priors as were founded
to hold of the King per Baroniam, and were called to the Parliament by Writ,
were Lords of Parliament, and had places and voices there. And of them were
twenty six Abbots, and two Priors, as by the Rolls of Parliament appear: yet
if you reckon the Abbot of Feuersham in Kent, founded by King Stephen, there
were twenty and seven, which some do, says my learned Author, warranted by
these words in the Cartularie: Et dedit Abbati, et Monachis, et successoribus^s
is Minerium de Feuersham, Com. Kane. simul cum Hundredo, etc. tenend. per
Baroniam. But (says he) albeit this Abbot held by a Baronie, yet because he
was never (that I find) called by Writ, he never sat in Parliament.

Bishoprics in England, Came. l. (...).
with that of the Isle of Man, are 37. whose extents I set down in the passage
of this work. Deanries 26. whereof thirteen were ordained by Henry the
eighth, in the greater Cathedral Churches after the Monks were thrust out.
Archdeacouries threesco^^. Dignities and Prebends five hundred forty four.

Numbered also there are Parish churches under Bishops 9284 of which 3845. be
Appropriat, as I find in a Catalogue, says he, exhibited to King James. Now,
Appropriat Churches, those are called, which by the Popes authority coming
between, with consent of the King, and the Bishop of the Diocese were upon
certain conditions tied, or Instruments united, annexed, and incorporate for
ever, unto Monasteries, Bishoprics, Colleges, and Hospitals, endowed with
small lands, either for that the said Churches were built their Lordships and
Lands or granted by the Lords of the said Lands. Which Churches afterward
when the Abbeyes and Monasteries were suppressed, became Lay Fees, to the
great damage of the Church.

Henry the eighth, presently upon the suppression of Monasteries, and his
ordination of certain Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, set d^wne by the
advice of his Counsel, a number of Rules and Statutes to be observed by the
Officers and Ministers residing in the same. As appears by this Record
following, which I thought to transcribe.

Henricus Octauus Dei gracia Anglie, ^

The Statutes, rules and orders were annexed hereunto; which were very many,
and more then can conveniently be included in this short Treatise, and more I
think then were well performed. As may partly be proved by an In^unction from
the Queens Majesty to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Matthew Parker, in these
words.

By the Queen.
The Queens Majesty considering how the palaces and houses of Cathedral
Churches and Colleges of this Realm have been both of ancyent and late time,
builded and enclosed in several to sustain and keep Socyeties of learned men
professing Study and prayer for the edification of the Church of God; and so
consequently to serve the Commonweal. And understanding of late that within
the houses hereof, as well the chief Governors as the Prebendaries, Students,
and members thereof being married, do keep particular households, with their
wives, children, and Nurses, whereof no small offense grows to thentent of
the Founders, and to the quiet and orderly profession of study and learning
within the same, has thought meet to provide remedy herein, lest by
sufferance thereof, the rest of the Colleges, specially such as be replenished
with young Students, as the very rooms and buildings be not answerable for
such families of women and young children, should follow the like example. And
therefore expressly wills and commands, that no manner of person, being
either the head or member of any College or Cathedral Church within this
(...), shall from the time of the notification hereof, in the same College
have, or be permitted to have, within the precinct of any such College, his
wife or other woman to abide and dwell in the same: or to frequent and haunt
any lodging within the said College, upon paint that whosoever shall do to the
contrary, shall forfeite all Ecclesiastical promotions in any Cathedral or
Collegiate Church within this Realm. And for continuance of this order, her
Majesty wills that the Transcript hereof shall be written in the book of
the Statutes of every such College; and shall be reputed as parcel of the
Statutes of the same. Yeuen under our Signet at ^ur Town of ipswiche, the
ninth of August in the third year of our reign.

Memorandum, That under the title of Benefices in every Diocese is contained
in figures two numbers. The first does show how many be of 30. l. in her
Majesty's Records, and under 40 l. The other number how many be of 40. l. value
and upwards. And under those figures be other figures which do show how many of
them be Vicarages. As for example, in the title of Benefices, in Bathe and
Wells, you have 380. Benefices, of them there is 14. of 30. l. value, and
under 40. l. and 5. of 40. l. value, and upwards. And of those of 30. l. value,
there are 6. Vicarages: and of those of 40. l. 1. Vicarage, as may appear by
the figures, and so of the rest.

possessions of the Clergy sithence the dissolution of Religious Houses,
Colleges, and Chauntries hitherto in value by estimation parcel of the said
320180. l. 10. s. to temporal uses. 161100. 09 07* q.

After the dissolution of the Religious Houses, Henry the eighth erected these
six Bishoprics, to wit, Westminster, Chester, Peterburgh, Oxford, Bristow,
and Gloucester, whereof the five last are in esse. And at the same time he
erected also these Cathedral Churches, hereafter mentioned, wherein he founded
a Deane, and the number of Prebends following. ( viz.) Cantuarien. 12. Winton.
12. Wigorn. 10. Cestren. 06. Peterburgh. 06. Oxon. 06. Elien. 08. Gloucestre.
06. Bristoll. 06. Carlioll. 04. Dunelm. 12. Roffen. 06. Norwicen. 06.


The yearly value of the said Cathedral Churches newly erected with the
Collegiate Churches of Windsore, Westminster, and Woluerhampton over and
besides the petticanons and other inferior Ministers amounts by estimation,
5942. 08. 02. So the yearly value of the Clergies Living, together with the
said sum of 150410. l. 12. s. over and besides the Colleges in the
Universities, and of Eaton, and New College aforesaid, amounts by estimation
to 156253. 00. 02. There are Parsonages appropriate in England according to my
collection, whereof there be Vicarages endowed over and besides diverse
Personages, whereof there is no endowment of Vicarages, ( viz.) 003236. 00. All
which Parsonages of right belonging to the Altar, and should be the proper
living of ^he Clergy, a few only excepted, which belong to Bishoprics,
Cathedral Churches, and the Colleges before mentioned, remain in the Laities
hands, which if you esteem one with another after 40 l. amount to the sum of
129440 00 00

Besides all this, if search and examination were made throughout England, it
would be found that the most part of the best Livings remaining in the
possession of the Clergy in every Diocese, either by Leases confirmed,
corrupt Aduousanes, or by the iniquity of Patrons and unlearned Ministers,
remain also in the Laities hands.

The first sum under every Bishopric is the original value at the taxation
of first fruits and tenths: the other sum is the value now remaining of
Record for the payment of first-fruites.

Sithence the taxation of first fruits and tenthes there has been taken from
Bishopprickes in value with 140 l. for the decay of the faculties ( viz.) 06894
04 09 There are Parsonages to the number of 41 made appropriate sithence the
taxation of first-fruites and tenths, which amount to the yearly value of (
viz.) 01663 14 09 q. The College of Llandewy breeuie in the Diocese of S.
David's having a Chauntership and 13 Prebends was lately taken away, amounting
to the sum of 00148 05 09

Memorandum, that the tenth of the Clergy in some Diocesses, as London,
Chichester, Hereford, Worcester, and others, is more then is expressed in the
title of Tenth; for there the tenth is set down, as it is chargeable to her
Majesty: the rest is allowed in lieu of certain Lands taken away from the
Bishopprickes: Canterbury and Elie have the tenth allowed wholly, saving that
Canterbury yields an account of 9. l. 2. s. 1. d.

The number of Benefices as is above mentioned is 8803.

Here ends the Discourse.
ANCIENT FUNERAL MONVMENTS WITHIN THE Diocese of Canterbury.
The Foundation of Christ-Church in Canterbury.
CHristian Religion (of which I have spoken before) which presently after our
blessed Saviors passion, was both preached, and planted in this Island, by
Joseph of Arimathea, and his associates, and after that advanced, and increased
by Lucius King of the Britains, and his famous Clerks; being darkened,
ouerclouded, and almost totally eclipsed, with the contagious smoke arising
from such abominable sacrifices as were offered here unto strange Idols; was
again illumined, and recomforted with the glorious beams of religious light
by Augustine the Monk, and his fellow laborers in Christ's vineyard. Which
Augustine (sent hither from Rome by Gregory the great) when he had found such
favor in the sight of King Ethelbert, that he might freely preach the Gospel
in this his country; he chose for assembly and prayer, an old Church in the
East part of this City, which was a long time before builded by the Romans,
and he made thereof (by license of the King) a Church, for himself and his
successors, dedicating the same to the name of our blessed Savior Christ;
whereof it was always afterward called Christ-Church. And by the means of the
said Pope Gregory, he translated the Metropolitan See from London (the
Cathedral Church being then at Saint Peter's in Cornhill) to this his newly
consecrated Church here in Canterbury: whereof he was the first Archbishop. By
these proceedings the prophecy of Merlin was fulfilled, which foretold that
Christianity should fail, and then revive again, when the Sea of London did
adorn Canterbury. Of which out of an old Robert of Gloucester.
Manuscript these following Rimes.

Erchebysshop furste of all Saint Austyn was there;
But ye Erchcbysshops Se at London was er:
Tho camme Merlynes word to sothe atten end,
Yat ye dignyte of London to Canterbery should wend.
Anothur church in Cantyrbery he let rere,
Yat is clupyd Christ Church, and now the Se is there.
Since which time, this sacred structure, by the pious and exceeding charges of
succeeding Archbishops (by the devotion of those days made willing to disburse
great sums) is so raised aloft (says learned Camden) to that majesty and
stateliness, Camd. in Kent.
that it strikes a sensible impression of Religion in the hearts and minds of
the beholders; of which, as also of the City, will it please you read this
Ogdoasticon out of a Manuscript penned by John Iohnston of Aberden, sometimes
the Kings professor of Divinity in the University of S. Andrews in
Scotland. M^ss. in ^ib. (...)
Quae minima in paruo regno pars ante fuisti,
Facta es Cantiadum regia prima Ducum.
Quae modica in magno imperio pars ante fuisti,
Maiorem fecit Pontificalis honor.
Alterius cum iura locitecum inde tulisti,
Facta es finitimis imperiosa locis.
Sponsa tibi Christi si tot cumulauit honores
Non iterum huic par sit reddere velle suos?
To this his Church Austine adjoined a Monastery, The foundation of the Priory
of S. Trinity.
and dedicated the same to the blessed Trinity; into which Laurence, his next
Successor, brought Benedictine Monks; the head whereof was called a Prior.
Which word (says Lambard in his perambulation of Kent) howsoever it sounds,
was indeed but the name of a second Officer, because the Bishop himself was
accounted the very Abbot; for in old time, the Bishops were, for the most part,
chosen out of such Monasteries, and therefore most commonly had their palaces
near adjoining, and governed there as Abbots. By means whereof it came to
pass, that such Abbeyes were greatly enriched, and endowed with wealth and
possessions; insomuch that this Priory at the dissolution (being valued at
Robin Hoods peniworths) was found to be yearly worth (besides jurisdiction over
diue^s hundreds) (as you may find in the Exchequer book, called, Nomina
Villarum) two thousand four hundred eighty nine pounds four shillings nine
pence. But Henry the eighth (says Camden) scattered this wealth heaped up
together in so many ages, and dispersed these Monks: in lieu of whom he placed
in this Church a Deane, an Archdeacon, Prebendaries twelve, and six Preachers;
who in places adjoining round about, should teach and preach the word of God.
The Archbishopric, at this day (whose Province contains twenty two
Bishoprics, Godwin. de prasid Angl
and Diocese the greatest part of Kent) being but valued in the Kings books
at two thousand eight hundred sixteen pounds, seventeen shillings, nine
pence. Howsoever in former times the Archbishop was wont to pay to the Pope at
every income for his first fruits ten thousand Ducats or Florens; and for his
Pall five thousand, every Ducate being of our Sterling money four shillings
six pence. And (as I find it in an old Manuscript) for Rom-scot or
Peter Pence, Lib. (...) in lib (...).
seven pounds seventeen shillings.

Seventy three Archbishops in a continued train of Succession, have sitten in
this glorious chair; which at this present does add grace and honor to
George Abbot, Doctor of Divinity, sometime Deane of Winchester, Master of the
University College in Oxford, Bishop of Couentry and Lichfield, from whence
he was removed to London, and from thence translated to this Metropoliticall
seat of Canterbury. Who has bestowed great sums of money in building and
endowing of an Hospital at Guildford in Surrey, the Town wherein he was borne.

But now to come within the Cathedral Church; which has been, and still is,
(...) Archbishop
honored with the funeral Monuments of many renowned Princes; of which
although it may justly vaunt, yet was it for nothing else so famous, as for the
life, death, sepulcure, and Shrine of Thomas Beck^t Archbishop of this See; by
which her estimation was advanced beyond all reason, measure and wonder.

This Thomas Becket was borne in London, his fathers name was Gilbert, a
Merchant, his mothers M^tilda, a stranger borne in Syria. He was first taught
and brought up, by the Prior of Mercon Abbey in Surrey, and from thence sent to
the Universities of Oxford, Paris, and Bononia, to study the Canon Law; upon
his return, he proceeded Doctor of that faculty in Oxford; after which (as you
may have it in the History of his life, written by the right reverend Father in
God, Francis Godwin, now Bishop of Hereford) in short time he was preferred by
Theobald, Archbishop of this See, unto the Archdeaconry of Canterbury, the
Prouostship of Beuerley, and the Parsonages of Bromfeeld, and Saint Mary Hill:
a Prebend in Paul's, and another in the Church of Lincoln, and withal
commended by him so effectually to King Henry the second, that he received him
into the number of his Chaplains, advanced him to the honor of Lord
Chancellor of England, and (after the death of the said Theobald) to this
Grace, and Prima^ie of Canterbury: presently after his consecration, being yet
scarcely warm in his seat, under color of defending the rights of his
Church, he stubbornly opposed himself against his Lord and Sovereign in all
his royal proceedings, insomuch that he was constrained to exile him the
kingdom. Of which you shall hear a piece out of Harding in the life of Henry
the second.

He exiled then, Hard. cap. 31.
Thomas of Cauntorbury
Out of England, and many of his alliance,
For cause of his rebellious governance;
And as he came fro Rome by France away
With language fell, he prayede the King that day
The points to mende.
And now, if you will give me leave a little to digress; I will tell you a
tale (believe it as you lift) reported by the said Thomas Becket himself, how
that being in banishment, our blessed Lady gave him a golden Eagle, full of
precious ointment, enclosed in a stone vessel, commanding him to preserve it;
foretelling withal, that the kings of England, which should be therewith
anointed, should be strong champions, and stout defendours of the Church that
they should be bountiful, benign, and fortunate, and that they should
peaceably recover such lands or territories, as had been before lost by their
predecessors; so long as they had this Eagle, with the vial or sacred vessel
in their custody, telling him withal, that he should be a Martyr. This
vision happened to him (forsooth) at Sens in France, in the Nuns Church
consecrated to Saint Columbe, in which City he found Pope Alexander the
third, a man, like himself, of an ambitious and turbulent ^ierie spirit, into
whose bosom, says Hollinshead, he emptied whole cart-loads of complaints and
grieuances, like a contumacious rebel, against his sovereign Lord:
excommunicating and cursing with bell, book, and candle, all that did any way
adhere unto the kings party.

But now to return to the words, by which he did express his strange and
incredible apparition, which I will set down in the same language, as I found
them anciently written in the Lieger book of the Abbey of Whalley in
Lanchishire. Thus he begins.

Quando ego Thomas Cantuar. Archiepiscopus, exul ab Anglia, fugie bam ad
Franciam, veni ad Papam Alex. qui tunc Senonis erat, vt ei ostenderem malas
consuetudines, and abusiones quas Rex Anglie in Ecclesiam in troducebat.

A (...) wholly ^end^ing (...) own purpose.
Quadam nocte cum essem in Ecclesia Sancte Columbe in Monial. rogaui Reginam
Virginum vt daret Regi Anglie et hered. propositum et voluntatem emendandi se
erga Ecclesiam, et quod Christus pro sua miserecordia, ampliori dilectione
ipsum faceret diligere Ecclesiam. Statim apparuit mihi beata Virgo, habens in
pectore istam aquilam auream, sieve lapideam, and accipiens Aquilam de pectore
suo ampullam includit. Aquilam cum Ampulla in manu mea posuit, et hec verba per
ordinem dixit.

Ista est vnctio per quam Reges Anglie debent inungi; non isti qui modo sunt
and regnant, and regnabunt, quia maligni sunt, and propter peccata sua multa

Henry the first Duke of Lancaster, under Edward the third in the wars of
France, had it delivered to him by an holy man (say they) which found it by
revelation. But of this enough, if not too much.

This Archbishop Becket, being recalled from exile, and restored to his former
honors and revenues, carried himself more obstinately then before,
perturbing the whole State with curses and excommunications in maintaining of
Ecclesiastical liberties (as he pretended) but most of all this kind of
dealing grieved the King, who cursed the time that ever he made him Archbishop.
Which is thus explained in old rimes.

For which the King was with him sore displeased;
That then he said, John (...) ^
had I had men that meant
Mine honest, I were not thus diseased
With such a Clerk, thus grieved and vneased.
It happened (amongst other) four Knights to be present at this speech of the
King, namely, Reynald Fitz^vrse, Hugh Moruill, William Tracy, and Richard
Briton; who gathered thereby, that they should do a deed very acceptable unto
him, Math. West.
if they killed the Archbishop. Whereupon (without either warrant or priuitie
of their Sovereign) they posted into England; came with their swords drawn
into this his own Church, and therein most barbarously murdered him with many
blows, upon Tuesday the 28. of December, Ann. Dom. 1170. as says Mat. Paris,
who in the same place observes that many remarkable occurrences behappened this
Martyr ever upon the Tuesday, more then upon any other day in the week.

Mars secundum poetas (says he) Deus belli nuncupatur: vita Sancti Thome
(secundum illud Job, vita hominis militia est super terram) tota suit contra
hostem bellicosa: passus fuit die Martis et translatus die Martis. Die Martis
sederunt Principes aduersus eum apud Northampton. Die Martis actus est in
exilium. Die Martis apparuit ei Dominus apud Pontiniacum, dicens, Thoma, Thoma,
Ecclesia mea glorificabitur in sanguine tuo. Et die Martis reuersus est ab
exilio. Martyrij palmam die Martis est adeptus. Et Die Martis Anno 1220.
venerabile eius corpus gloriam translationis suscepit, anno 50. post passionem
eius.

In English as follows.

Mars according to the Poets, is called the God of war; the life of Saint
Thomas (according to that of Job, the life of man is a warfare upon earth) was
a continual conflict against the enemy; upon the Tuesday he suffered, upon
Tuesday he was translated, upon Tuesday the Peers of the Land sat in council
against him at Northampton. Upon Tuesday he was banished; upon Tuesday the Lord
appeared to him at Pontiniacke, saying, Thomas, Thomas, my Church shall be
glorified in thy blood. Upon Tuesday he returned from exile, upon Tuesday he
got the palm or reward of Martyrdom, and upon Tuesday the year 1220. his
venerable body received the glory and renown of translation, in the fiftieth
year after his passion.

But to return. Rog. Houeden. Annal. in (...). Hen. 2.
It is said that these four knights despairing to obtain the Kings pardon,
wandered up and down (for a time) like vagabonds and runagates upon the earth;
being hstefull to all their kindred, as well as to their countrymen, until at
length they resolved to go a pilgrimage to Rome, where Pope Alexander the third
enjoined them this penance, which was to travel to Jerusalem, and there to
live as penitenciall conuertites in the black mountain; where they finished
their days; and were buried in Jerusalem before the door of the Temple, for
whom this inscription was framed.

Hic iacent miseri qui martirizauerunt beatum Thomam Archiepiscopum
Cantuariensem. Id^m.


Of these four Knights which murdered this Archbishop, and of the three
Bishops which conspired together against him, I found these Hexa^i^ers in an
old Manuscript in Sir Robert Cottons Library.

Quatuor hij proceres Reginaldus Filius Vrsi,
Hugo de Morvilla, Willelmus que Tracensis,

Hij tres G^lfridus qui primus Eliacensis,

Amborum complex Sarum Presul Iocelinus,
Aduersus Thomam conspirauere beatum.
The body of this murdered Bishop was buried first in the vndercrost of the
Church, but shortly after it was taken up and laid in a most sumptuous Shrine
in the East end; at the charges of Stephen Langton his successor: being
matriculated by the Pope a glorious Saint and Martyr. To this new shrined
Martyr, people of all degrees, and from all parts, flocked in pilgrimage: as
Chaucer thus has it in his Prologue to his Canterbury tales.

-- fro every shires end
Of England, to Canterbury they wend:
The holy blisfull Martyr for to seek,
That hem has helped where they were seek.
Eras. ^^alogue.
They loaded the Shrine with such large offerings, that the Church did all round
about abound with more then Princely riches, whose meanest part was pure gold,
garnished with many precious stones. Whereof the cheesest was a Regal of
France, or a rich gemme, offered by King Lewis, who asked, (...). La^d. (...).
and obtained (you may be sure, he buying it so dear) that no passenger
betwixt Dover and Whitesand, should perish by shipwreck. Such pressing there
was to touch him, and such creeping and kneeling to his Tomb, that the prints
of their devotion in the marble stones remain to this day. Every pillar
resounding the miracles of this reputed Martyr, and the Church it self,
dedicated to Christ, forced to give place to the name of Saint Thomas. Er^sin.
in O^al. de pereg^. religions ergo.
His blood was as then almost matched in virtue with our blessed Saviors, and
his old shoe devoutly kissed by all passengers. The building of this shrine is
thus briefly described by that painful Antiquarie Io. Stow. Stow Annal in
(...) H. 8.
It was built (says he) about a man's height all of stone, then upward of
Timber plain, within the which was a chest of iron, containing the bones of
Thomas Becket, Skull, and all, with the wound of his death, and the piece cut
out of his skull laid in the same wound. The timber work of this Shrine on the
out side was covered with plates of gold, damasked and embossed with wires of
gold, garnished with broches, images, Angels, chains, precious stones, and
great orient pearls, the spoil of which Shrine (in gold and jewels of an
inestimable value) silled two great chests, one of which, six or eight strong
men could do no more then convey out of the Church: all which was taken to the
Kings use, and the bones of Saint Thomas (by commandment of the Lord Cromwell)
were then and there burnt all to ashes. Which was in September, the year 1538.
Hen. 8.30.

Diverse Epitaphs were composed to the memory of this much honored Martyr,
expressing the cause, time, and place of his martyrdom. For example.

Annus Millenus, Houeden in (...) H. 2.
centenus, septuagenus
Primus erat, Primas quo ruit ense Thomas.
Pro Christi sponsa, Christi sub tempore, Christi
In Templo, Christi verus amat^r obit.
Quis moritur? Presul. Cur? pro grege. qualiter? Ense.
Quando! natali. Quis locus? ara Dei.
Quinta dies Natalis erat; Flos orbis ab orb

Henricus natus Matildis regna tenebat,
Sub quo Sacratus Thomas mucrone cadebat.
This Anthem was likewise made to his honor.

Tu per Thome sanguinem quem pro te impendit,
Fac nos Christ scandere quo Thomas as^endit.
For the blood of Thomas which he for thee did spend
Grant us Christ to clime where Thomas did ascend.
The Pope writ to the Clergy of England, to make a new Holiday for this late
Martyr, an extract or clause whereof followe^h.

We admonish you all, ^
and by the authority which we retevne, do straightly charge you, that you
celebrate the day of the suffering of the blessed man Thomas, the glorious
Martyr, sometime Archbishop of Canterbury, every year in most solemn sort,
and that with devout prayers ye endeavor your selves to purchase forgiveness
of sins: that he which for Christ's sake suffered banishment in this life, and
martyrdom in death by constancy of virtue, through continual supplication of
faithful people, may make intercession for you to God.

The tenor of these letters were scarcely read, but every man with a loud voice
began to recite and sing, Te Deum laudamus.

Furthermore, because his Suffragans had not exhibited due reverence to him
their father, either in time of his banishment, or at his return from the
same, but rather persecuted him; that they might openly confess their error
and wickedness to all men, they made this Collect.

Be favorable good Lord to our supplication and prayer, A Collect devised in
honor of Archbishop Becket.
that we which acknowledge our selves guilty of iniquity, may be delivered by
the intercession of Thomas thy blessed Martyr and Bishop. Amen.

This Collect was likewise used by the Covent of S. Albons, and other Religious
Votaries upon the day of his martyrdom.

Robert the first Earl of Dreux, and the fourth son of Lewis the gross,
King of France, laid the foundation of a Collegiate Church, to the honor of
this supposed holy Martyr, called, S. Thomas du Louure in Paris, the revenues
whereof were augmented by his wife Agnes, Countess of Bray, and confirmed by
the Bull of Clement the third, Bishop of Rome, in these terms.

Clemens Episcopus seruus seruorum Dei, Dilectis filijs Canonicis Ecclesie

These donations were afterward, viz. Ann. 1428. augmented by John Duke of
Britain, Montefort, and Richmund, as appears by his Charter which I have read.

Many other religious structures, Churches, Chapels, and Oratories in foreign
parts were erected, and endowed to the memory of this our English Martyr.

Near to the Gallerie of the Louure, and adjoining to the Collegiate Church,
is a pretty fair street, which at this day is called, La rue de S. Thomas du
Louure, the street of S. Thomas at the Louure.

Knights of the order of S. Thomas*
Richard the first, King of England, after the surprisall of Acrres, instituted
an order of Knights, which he called, The Order of Saint Thomas; they held the
rule of Saint Augustine, and took for their Patron the foresaid Thomas Becket,
Archbishop of Canterbury, as you may read in the Theater of Honor, lib. 9.
cap. 11.

But I stand too long gazing and glossing upon this imaginary monument,
digressing from the brevity of that method which I have proposed to my self.
Let me view the sumptuous monument still remaining of Edward surnamed the
black Prince (so by-named not of his color, but of his dreaded acts in
battle) upon which this Epitaph is inlayd with brass.

Thus Englished.

Here lies the noble Prince, Monsieur Edward, the eldest son of the thrice
noble King Edward the third, in former time Prince of Aquitaine, and of Wales,
Duke of Cornwall, and Earl of Chester, who died on the feast of Trinity,
which was the eight day of June, in the year of Grace, 1376. To the soul of
whom, God grant mercy. Amen.

Who so thou be that passes by;
Where these corpse entombed lie:
Understand what I shall say,
As at this time speak I may.
Such as thou art, sometime was I,
Such as I am, such shall thou be.
I little thought on th'oure of death,
So long as I enjoyed breath.
Great riches here I did possess,
Whereof I made great nobleness.
I had gold, silver, wardrobes, and
Great treasure, horses, houses, land:
But now a caitife poor am I,
Deep in the ground, lo here I lie.
My beauty great is all quite gone,
My flesh is wasted to the bone.
My house is narrow now and throng,
Nothing but Truth comes from my tongue:
And if ye should see me this day,
I do not think but ye would say,
That I had never been a man;
So much altered now I am.
For Gods sake pray toth'heauenly King,
That he my soul to heaven would bring.
All they that pray and make accord,
For me unto my God and Lord;
God place them in his Paradise,
Wherein no wretched caitife lies.
The death of this Prince (which fortuned in the forty and sixth year of his
age) was a heavy loss to the state; S. Daniel. Hist. of England.
being a Prince of whom we never heard any ill, never received other note then
of goodness, and the noblest performances that magnanimity and wisdom could
ever show, in so much as what praise can be given to ve^^ue is due to him: The
compendious Chronicle of Canterbury written by one Thomas Haselwood, Mss. in
bib. Cot.
a Canon of Leedes speaks more particularly of his military atchieuements in
these words.

Edwardus filius Edw. 3. primogenitus, Princeps Wallie fortunatissimus, and
miles in bello audacissimus, inter validissima bella gesta militaria, magnisice
ab eodem peracta; Iohannem Regem Francie apud Poyteires debellauit, and
pluribus, tam nobilibus quam alijs, de dicto regno captis, and interfectis,
eundem Regem captiuauit, and ipsum potenter in Augliam ductum Patri suo
presentauit. Henricum etiam intrusorem Hispanie, potentissime in bello deuicit,
and Petrum Hispanie Regem dudum a regno suo expulsum potenti virtute in regnum
suum restituit. Vnde propter ingentem sibi probitatem, and actus ipsius
triumphales memoratum Principem inter regales Regum memorias dignum duximus
commendandum.

Hen^y the fourth King of England.
Here lies the body of Henry the fourth, King of England, whose Tomb is richly
adorned and garnished about with the Arms of all the Christian Princes, and
most of the greatest Peers of this kingdom, then living; upon which I find
no Inscription, who died 20. Mar. Anno Dom. 1412. aetat. 46. Reg. 14.

This King finished his politic and victorious reign in peace and honor.
Howsoever the injustice of his first entrance (stepping into the seat Royal by
the deposition and murder of his lawful Sovereign King Richard the second)
left a dishonorable stain upon all his actions. He advised his Son Henry
(after him King) upon his death bed, to punish the oppressors of his people:
Speed in vita Hen. ^.
for so shall thou (quoth he) obtain favor of God, and love and fear of thy
subjects, who whiles they have wealth, so long shall thou have their obedience,
but made poor by oppressions, will be ready for insurrections.

Let this memorial of him, in such rimes as I have it, stand for his Epitaph.

Kings.

The same Author in another place, to the laud and memory of this King, has
these nicking Hexameters.

Electus Christi pie Rex Henrice fuisti,
Qui been venisti, cum propria regna petisti,
Tu mala vicisti que bonis bona restituisti,
Et populo tristi noua gaudia contribuisti,
Est mihi spes lata, quod adhuc pro te renouata

Et tibi nam grata gratia sponte data.
And the said Gower makes a ballade to this king, to his no little
commendations. Whereof take the first Stanza for an Essay.

O noble worthy King Henry the fearth,
In whom the glad Fortune is befall:
The people to govern here upon earth,
God has thee chosen in comfort of us all.
The worship of this land, which was dounfall,
Now stant upright through grace of thy goodness.
Which every man is hold for to bless.
Caxton the continuer of Polychronicon, says, that this King Henry the fourth
found great riches, whereof Richard his predecessor was possessed at the time of
his resignation of the Scepter royal. These are the words: Then he fond in
King Rychads tresorye nine hundryd thousand nobles besides Jewels and Vessels,
Poly. (...). cap. ^0.
which was as much worth or more. And there was found in the Tresorers
keeping of England an hundryd and fyfty thousand nobles; and Jewels and Vessels
as much worth or more: Upon which, says Fabian, It should seem that King
Richard was rich, Fab in Ann. 1400.
when his money and Iewelles amounted to seven hundryd thousand pounds.

Sir Simon D'ewes Knight, a diligent searcher of Antiquities, gave me the copy
of King Henry's Will, here entombed, examined by the original under the privy
Seal, according to the orthographie in the said original: which is not
unworthy, I hope, of my Readers perusal.

The last Will of King Henry the fourth.
In the name of God Fadir, and Son, and holy Ghost, three persons and on God. I

Ianuer, the year of owr Lord, M.CCCC.VIII. and of our Reign the tenth.

He departed this world the twentieth of March, as aforesaid, some three years
and odd months after the making of this his last Will and Testament, in a
Chamber belonging to the Abbot of Westminster, called Jerusalem, having been
prophetically foretold that he should die in Jerusalem.

The words, says Harding, that the King said at his death, were of high
complaint, but naught of repentance, of vsurpement of the Realm, ne of
restorement of right heirs to the Crown. Which he thus versifies.

O Lord, he said, O God omnipotent,
Now se I well thy Godhede loves me,
That suffered never my foes to have their intent
Of mine person in mine adversity:
Ne in mine sickness, ne in mine infyrmyte:
But ay have kept it fro their maleuolence,
And chastised me by thy benevolence.
Lord I thank the with all my heart,
With all my soul, and my spirits clear;
This worms mete, this caryon full vnquerte,
That some time thought in world it had no pere,
This face so foul that leprous does appear,
That here afo^e I have had such a pride
To purtray often in many place full wide.
Of which right now the porest of this land,
Except on^y of their benignite
Would loathe to ^^oke upon I understand
Of which, good Lord, that thou so visyte me
A thousand times the Lord in Trinyte
With all my heart, I thank the and commend
Into thine hands my soul withouten end.
And dyed so in faith and hole creance
At Cauntorbury buried with great reverence,
As a king should be with all kind of circumstance,
Beside the Prince Edward, with great expense.
His funeral Exequies were solemnised here in all pomp and state, his Son
Henry the fifth and his Nobility being present, upon Trinity Sunday next
following the day of his death.

The reason (as I take it) wherefore King Henry made choice of this Church for
his burial place, Mary the first wife of Henry the fourth.
was, for that his first wife (the Lady Mary, one of the daughters and coheires
of Vmphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, Essex, and Northampton) was here
entombed; who died before he came to the Crown, Ann. Dom. 1394. leaving
behind her a glorious and fair renowned issue of children, to the comfort of
her husband, and good of the commonwealth: viz. Henry afterward King of
England, Thomas Duke of Clarence, John Duke of Bedford, Humphrey Duke of
Gloucester. Blanch married to William Duke of Bauaria, and Emperor, and Philip
married to John King of Denmark and Norway.

Lancaster, by his last wife Katherine Swinford, and surnamed Beaufort, of
Beaufort, a Castle in Aniou, where he was borne: He was created first Earl of
Somerset, and after Marquess Dorset, by Richard the second: being but of small
means to support such a swelling title.

He made therle of Somerset Marquis Io. Harding. cap 192.

Of Dorset then; Sir John Beaufort that hight;
Of poor liuelode that was that time doubtless.
But he was deprived of this title of Marquess Dorset, by Act of Parliament,
in the first of Henry the fourth, his half brother, for whom afterward the
Commons became earnest petitioners in Parliament for his restitution. But he
himself was altogether unwilling to be restored to this kind of newly
invented honor, being but begun in the ninth year of this Kings reign, and
given to Robert de Vere, his mignion; the first styled Marquess of England, as
it is observed by that most learned Antiquarie and Lawyer, Ti^les of honor
page 211
Io. Seldom Esquire. I find little of him remarkable, being (belike) sore
weakened both in power and spirit, by the foresaid Parliament; whereby (with
others of the Nobility) he was reduced to the same estate of honor and
fortune (which was but weak) in which he stood when first Thomas of
Woodstocke, Hollins. pa. 513.
Duke of Gloucester, was arrested; and besides it was not lawful for him, nor
any of the rest, to give liueries to retainers, or keep any about him but
necessary servants. He died on Palmesonday the 16. of March, Ann. Dom. 1409.

On her right side is the pourtraiture of her second husband, Thomas Duke of
Clarence.
Thomas Duke of Clarence, second soune of King Henry the fourth, Lord high
Steward of England, Constable of the Kings Host, and Lieutenant General of his
Army in France: who (after his many fortunate events in war) was the first
man that was slain in the battle of O^, little Baugie
Baugy, upon Easter Eve An. Do. 1420. by one John Swinton, a Scot, who wounded
him in the face with his Lance, as he was remounting (having given singular
demonstration of his great valor) and so threw him to the ground. And with him
that day were slain many of exemplarie note, besides 4500. common Soldiers.

This Duke had borne forth his youth with better respect then Prince Henry his
brother had done; Hab. (...).
and was made President of the Council, when his brother was dismissed that
office for striking the Lord chief Justice; yet for all that, his father sore
feared, that his hasty distempered humor would breed great troubles in the
State: and questionless he was of a violent selfe-willie disposition,
neglecting now at the last cast the grave advise of his own contrymen, his
chiefest Commanders by which, by all likelihood, he might have escaped all
danger: and adhering to the treacherous persuasion of a (...) For (...) ^um

Stranger, by which he was betrayed to present destruction. Which fierie-rash
temper of his, together with the loss of the Battle, and the place of his
burial, is briefly thus set down by my Author John Harding.

And nere at Bawge came Gilbert Vmsreuile,
Marshall of France, with V. horse and no mo,
^
And of good wit, counsayled him that while
To keep the Church, and Gods service tho,
And after the Feast to seek upon his foo.
And he answered him, if thou be aferd,
Go home thy way, and keep the church yerd.
With that he said my Lord ye have no men,
With the enemies thus hastily to sight:
Your men wot not of this, ne how, ne whenne,
To semble to you of power, ne of might.
For trewly now, my Cousin Gray now right
And I, have here but ten men and no mo,
But yet ye shall never say we leave you so.
So rode they forth ay chyding by the way,
Till they to Bawgy over the Bridge were gone,
When the enemies were battayled in array,
Where then they light and fought with them anon.
The Duke was slain that day there with his sone.
With him were slain then therle Vmfreuile,
And Sir John Gray the Earl of Tankeruile.
The Lord Roos, and sir John Lumley,
With many other were with him slain that day,
Whose names I cannot write nor say
The Earls two of Huntingdon no nay,
Of Somerset also, were taken there I say
For prisoners and put to great raunson,
And lay full long in France then in prison.
Thenglish Power came, when all was done,
And rescowed then, the deed men where they lay,
And brought the Lords home fro thens full sone
That there lay slain upon the feeld that day
And buried them in England in good array
Each one in his Abbaye or Colage
Before founded within his heritage.
The English power under the conduct of Thomas Montacute, Earl of Salisbury,
coming somewhat too late to this ouer-hastie encounter, thought to have
requited this loss upon their enemies heads, but at the sight of their forces
the French gave ground, whereby the dead body of Clarence was recovered, and
(with the rest) conveyed into England; and buried in this Church.

At Canterbury the Duke was of Orleance, Idem eodem:

Beside his Father King Henry buried,
With such honor costage and expense
As the Duches his wife could have signified
Which neded not to have been modifyed.
She was so well within her self avysed
Of great sadness, and woman head premised.
This following I have read for his Epitaph. Lib. Sawler, Mss. in bib. Cot.

In the vndercroft of our Ladies Chapel is an ancient Monument thus

likewise gave name to Sir Bartholomew Burwash, Lamb. peramb.
Knight of the Garter, Constable of Dover Castle, and Lord Warden of the Cinque

Here lies interred Isabell de Dover, Isabel Countess of Atholl.
Countess of Assyle, as Stow calls her, but I think there is a mistaking of
Assyle for Atholl, as will partly appear by the sequel.

Fulbert Lord of Chilham, had one only daughter and heir, whom Richard the
base son of King John took to wife, Camden, in this Tract.
by whom he had two daughters, Lora the wife of William Marmion, and Isabell
wife to David of Stratbolgy, Earl of Atholl, and afterward to Sir Alexander
Baliol, who was called to Parliament by the name of Lord of Chillham, and
mother to that John, Earl of Athol, who being condemned oftentimes for
treason, was hanged at the last upon a gibbet fifty foot high; as King Edward
the first commanded, Stow Annal.
because he might be so much the more conspicuous in men's eyes, as he was of
higher and nobler birth, being of the Kings blood. Lora was secondly married to
one of the Lord Berkeleyes Ancestors, if we may give any credit to these
ancient rimes.

Cuthert Archbishop of Cant.
The first Archbishop that I find to be buried in this Church was Cuthbert, or
Cudbrict (for before him they were always buried at Saint Augustines) an
Englishman of great parentage, translated from Hereford, the year 742. to this
seat of Canterbury. Godwin, do Ptaeful. Aug.
In whose time the Laity were wicked, and the Clergy worse; the whole land
was overwhelmed with a most dark and palpable mist of ignorance, and polluted
with all kind of impiety. Which to reform, he called together a Synod of
Bishops and learned men at Cloueshoo (now Cliffe at Hoo) beside Rochester,
Lamb. ye^amb.
and there, after long consultation, caused one and thirty Canons to be
decreed, one of which was, That the Priests were required to read to their
Parishoners the Lords prayer, and the Creed in the English tongue: which, with
the rest, De ges^^^ Pontis. lib. 1.
you may read in William Malmesbury. This Bishop obtained from the Pope a
dispensation for making of Coemiteries, or Churchyards, within Towns and
Cities, whereas until his time within the walls none were buried; Appendix
Cron. Rotsen. in bib. Cot.
as I have it thus in a Manuscript. Cutbertus Archiepiscopus Cant. xi. ab
Augustino cum Rome videret plures intra Civitates sepeliri, rogauit Papam vt
sibi liceret cemiteria facere, guod Papa annuit, reuersus itaque cemiteria
vbique in Anglia fieri constituit. He died, Ann. Dom. 758.

Odo Seuerus Archbishop
I find little of any other Bishop here buried, until the time of Odo Seuerus
who lies here interred under a Tomb of Touchstone (surnamed Seuerus of the
austeritie of his life and government) borne of Danish parents, Pagans, and
utter enemies of Christ and Christian religion, insomuch that they disinherited
this their Son Odo, for keeping company with Christians, Godwin de Praef.

so that he was constrained to forsake his fathers house, his kindred, and
country, and betake himself to the service of a Nobleman in the Court of King
Edward the elder, named Ethelelm, who set him to school, where he profited
exceedingly. He was not baptized till he was come to man's estate: soon after
his baptism, by the advice of Ethelelm his Master, he entered into orders; yet
before he came to be a Clergy man, he served in the wars, which is not
unlikely, says mine Author, for after he was Bishop he was thrice in the
field, Antiquit. Brit. M. Parker.
and did his Prince notable service. He was first preferred to the Bishopric
of Wilshire (whose See was then seated at Ramsbury) by the special favor of
King Athelstan; who being dead, his brother Edmund, who succeeded him in his
kingdom, loving him no less, procured him to be chosen Archbishop. In which
pastoral charge he continued many years in great favor, and authority,
under diverse Princes, till toward the latter end of his time, that Edwin a
young King was sore exasperated against him, for that this Bishop had caused
him to be divorced from his Queen, for consanguinitie, or some other reasons,
and excommunicated his Concubines, causing one of them, whom the king doted
upon, to be fetched out of the court by violence, to be burnt in the forehead
with an hot iron, and banished into Ireland. But not long after he was taken
away by death from the Kings displeasure, Io. Bale. Cent. 2
in the year of our redemption, 958. having sat Archbishop 25. years, or
thereabouts. He writ diverse Tractates both in verse and prose, Io. Capg. in
vita S. Odonis.
mentioned by Bale, and Capgraue, will have him in the Calendar of our English
Saints and Confessors. But to conclude, such was his Epitaph.

Stemmate serenus iacet hic sacer Odo Seuerus: Ex vet. Miss. in bib. Cot.

The life and death of this Archbishop Lanfranck is set down at large by
William Malmsbury, Lanfrank Archbishop of Cant.
Io. Capgraue, Nicholas Harpsfeild, Archdeacon of Canterbury, Matthew Parker,
Archbishop, with others, and out of them all by Francis Godwin, now Bishop of
Hereford. Yet for method sake thus much, because I find his body (by a Table
inscribed which hangs upon his Tomb) to be here interred. He was borne in
Italy, at Pauia, some twenty miles from Myllaine, brought up in the Monastery
of Becco in Normandy, under Herlewin the learned Abbot of that house, of which
he became Prior: from whence, in regard of his singular wisdom, and great
knowledge in all good literature, he was called by William the Duke of
Normandy to be Abbot of Saint Stephens in Cane, a Monastery that the said
Duke had founded. And in the fifth year after his conquest of England, he
promoted him to this Archbishopricke, which he laudablie governed the space of
eighteen years. It is said (an action which much obscured all his former
praises) that he persuaded the Conqueror to leave the kingdom of England to
his younger son William Rufus: which they said William thus requited; the
Bishop (as the King thought) being somewhat too busy in reprehending his
manifold vices, and exhorting him to godliness and virtue; he so bitterly fell
out with him, that he banished him the Realm; the poor old bishop traveled
to Rome; and wandered up and down many countries, till by intercession of
friends he was suffered to return home; and soon after died of an ague,
Harpsfeld Vndec. secul ca. 1^.
according to his own desire. Solebat enim Deum rogare vt velex dissenteria
vel ex febri diem suum obiret, propterea quod hi morbi nec memoriam, nec
loquelam auferant. He would often desire God that he might take his end either
by a flux, or an ague: for that in those kind of infirmities men are wont to
have the use both of speech and memory to the last cast. Floren Higorn.
His death happened the 24. of May, Ann. Dom. 1089. He bestowed much upon the
fabric of this Church, and the housing of the Monks: he built in a manner
all the Archbishops palace, he founded two Hospitals adjoining to this City,
he gave great sums of money, and also a Manor toward the building of the
Cathedral Church of Rochester, and did much for the Abbey of Saint Albons. He
increased the number of the Monks of this Church, from thirty to forty,
restored the dignities and offices of old belonging to the Monastery, and
recovered unto the same 25. Manors that had been taken from it wrongfully in
times past, Pitseus. Bale. Centuria secunda.
by Odo Bishop of Bayon, and Earl of Kent. He was a profound Scholar for
those times; he writ the noble acts of the Conqueror, he made learned Comments
and Expositions of many parts of the Bible, and took great pains in reforming
the same, the copies whereof were much corrupted throughout all England, by the
negligent ouer-sight of the writers. To his memory this Epitaph was composed.

Anselme Archbishop.
Here is the Tomb of Archbishop Anselme, borne in Augusta a City of Burgundy,
who followed his predecessors steps almost foot by foot. First he came to
Becco upon the like errand as Lanfrank had done; which was to obtain knowledge
in all good learning: Antiquitales Brilan in vita Ans.
Lanfrancke being called away to Cane, he was made Prior of Becco in his place,
and afterward Abbot, in which he continued 15. years, until at the request
of Hugh Earl of Chester, he came over into England; and had this Bishopric
bestowed upon him, some four years after the decease of Lanfrancke (for so
long the king pursed up the profits thereof) by William Rufus; who presently
after his consecration fell out with his new Bishop, and banished him the
kingdom; in which he traveled up and down as an exile during the Kings life,
until by his brother King Henry the first, he was called home, and restored to
all his former dignities. Godwin. de Praef. Aug.
But not long after he was likewise banished the Realm by the said Henry,
falling out with him concerning the disposing of Bishoprics at the Kings
pleasure, giving inuestiture, and possession of them by the staff, and the
ring, within three years, by the means and mediation of Adela or Alice,
Countess of Blois, the Kings sister, he was restored, not only to his place,
but to all his goods and fruits gathered in the time of his absence. Some two
years after this his last return, falling sick of a languishing disease, he
died April 21. Ann. Dom. 1109. in the sixteenth year of his government. Some
400. years after, by the procurement of John Morton, one of his Successors,
he was canonized a Saint, and one as worthy that honor as any that ever since
his (...) was canonized by the Pope; for, as his life and (...) was for
integrity even admirable, and so was his learning as his works ^et ex^ant do
testify. Now because his Epitaph is either worn out, or was ever wanting, I
will be so bold as borrow one for him from one of his own name, which I have
read upon a Monument in Parma, in Italy.

In the south part of Saint Thomas Chapel, (...) Archbishop.
in a marble Tomb joining to the wall, lies the body of Theobald, Archbishop
of this See. Who was chosen to that Grace by the Suffragan Bishops of his own
Province, in a Convocation held at London: he was a Benedictine Monk, and
Abbot of Becco; a man of no great learning, but of so gentle and sweet
behavior (being very wise withal) as he was greatly esteemed of high and
low, Kings, Nobles, and Commons; yet howsoever he was of an affable mild
nature, Antiq. Britan.
and fair demeanure, his patience was so greatly moned (upon good occasion)
that he interposed the Popes authority; with whom the King was made a party,
Goeh^i^. in v^ (...).
so far, as that his goods and Temporalties were twice confiscate seized into
the King^ hands, and himself once banished the kingdom: which so netled him,
that like a tall fellow, Nam laesa patientia fit furor, he interdicted King
Stephen, and the whole Realm, and taking advantage of the time, which was
wondrous troublesome, came home and lived in Norfolk, till by the intercession
of certain Bishops, he was restored. After which he grew into great favor
with the said King, and was the chief means of concluding that final peace
at Wallingford, Mat Pa^is Ann. 115^.
between him and Maud the Empress. Shortly after which, King Stephen died,
and Henry, surnamed Fitz empress, son of Geffrey Plantaginet, and Maud the
Empress, succeeded him in the Regalitie, under whom this Bishop passed the
rest of his days quietly in great favor and estimation: and died,
Antiquitales Britan.
Ann. 1160. when he had sat Archbishop 22. years. Perceiving his end to
approach, he made his Will, and gave all his goods to the poor, or other like
good uses. Of whom this Epitaph was made.

I find one Richard (for I find no further of his name) Archbishop of this
chair, Richard Archbishop.
to be here interred in our Ladies Chapel, sometime a Benedictine Monk^,
Prior of the Monastery of Saint Martins in Dover, a man very libera^l, (...)
gentle, and wise; for he so handled the matter, that in all his time he never
was at odds, or out, either with the Pope or King. The Pope he entertained with
often gifts and money, the Kings favor he retained by yielding, and conforming
himself to his pleasure. This man continued in his government, about the space
of ten or eleven years. In all which time there happened not any thing of him
worthy of memory; except the controversy, (...). Westminst. 11^6.

was content with one. ^ib. ^^ocest. M^s.
An ill husband he was for his Church, if we may believe this my old Author.
This Richard (says he) was a man of great Religion, and also of great wit in
his temporal governance; but in defending of his freedom of holy Church, and
punishment of excess, and misbeleeuers, to simple and slow; which is partly
approved by the sequel (if the report of his end and death may pass for
current truth) how that being a sleep at his Manor of Wrotham, (...) Britan.

said, he vanished away. In the morning the Bishop (taking his journey toward
Rochester) related this fearful vision unto a friend of his by the way, which
he had no sooner told, then that he was taken suddenly with a great cold, and
stiffenesse in his limbs, so that they had much ado to get him so far as
Halling, a house belonging to the Bishop of Rochester, where he took his bed;
and being horribly tormented with the Chollick, and other griefs, gave up the

Hubert Walter Archbishop:
In the South wall of this Church, lies the body of Hubert Walter, or Walter
Hubert, (for such a transmutation of the name I find to be used) who was
borne at West-Derham in Norfolk, Francis Thin
and brought up under Raynulph de Glanfeld, Antiq B^^tan Godwin. de prae^ul. Ang
chief Justice of England. The first preferment he obtained was the Deanrie
of York, thence he was called by King Richard the first, unto the Bishopric
of Salisbury. Whom he attended in all that long and dangerous voyage into the
holy Land; as a Commander, or Colonel of some English forces, Ger. Dorob:
by whose valor and his own, he performed admirable service at the siege and
surrender of Acon, and other fortified places, H^llins. pa 1^2.
for which, and for his discreet handling the matter, in procuring 250000.
Marks of the Clergy, for the ransom of his Master King Richard, the said
King knew not how to heap honors sufficient upon him; so that at one time he
was Archbishop, the Popes Legate, Lord Chancellor, Lord chief Justice, and high
immediate Governor under him of all his Dominions, both in Wales and England:
he was much blamed (and peradventure not unworthily) for undertaking so many
great offices; For Pluribus intentus minor est ad singula sensus.
howsoever, ^ig Heueden
never any man used his authority and power more moderately; faithful and
loyal he was ever to his Prince, loving and very care^u^l of his country, ^
in which he caused many excellent Decrees and Laws to be established. His
house keeping was such, as the expense thereof was thought to be little
inferior to the Kings; he built a Monastery at Durham, the place of his
birth, began another at Wulferhampton, encomp^ssed the Tower of London with a
strong wall; and a deep Moat, been ^ased the revenues of his See, adorned it
with many sumptuous and sta^ely buildings, and procured diverse notable
privileges for the same; and to repair the books and Library of this Church,
^
he gave the Church of Halegast: he finished a Collegiate Church at Lambeth, of
Canons regular, begun by Baldwin his predecessor. Which upon the complaint of
the Monks of Canterbury to the Pope, was pulled down to the ground. Ma^ny
oppositions were betwixt him and the Pope, (...) 119^.
and many times he was discountenanced by King John, yet (apparently) he died
in both their favors, at his Manor of Tenham, July 13. 1205. Having sat
Archbishop twelve years saving four months.

Here lies entombed the body of Stephen Langton Archbishop, Stephen Langton
Archbishop.
whose election to this See, against the Kings will, was the cause of many
calamities within this kingdom, the greatest part whereof fell upon the
Clergy; Of which hear my Author.

Bishop Hubert of Canterbury tho died, John Harding. cap. 142.

Wherefore King John unto the Covent sent,
To chose his John Gray Bishop o^ Norw^ch.

Wherefore the king was wroth in his entente;
For they disobeyed the lettre which he sent,
For they had chosen Master Stephan Langton;

But prisoned some, and some to death commytte,
Some he exiled, and their eyes clear,
And all persounes and Prelates in fere
He then put out, and seized their benefice
Through all the land, as his mortal enemies.
The Romysh Bishop curssed him openly
And all the realm fully did enterdite,
That Sacraments none, therein should occupy.
But howsoever these mischiefs happened upon his admittance, yet the man (in
regard of his many excellent gifts both of body and mind) was no way to be
misliked, but much to be commended, for his religious wise carriage, living
under so violent a King. And in such troublesome ungodly times, to whom this
Distichon, taken out of Martials Epigrams, to Traian warfaring under
Diocletian, was applied, Laudari debes, quoniam sub principe duro, Giraldus

descended he was from an ancient family in Lecestershire, brought up in the
University of Paris, greatly esteemed by the King and all the Nobility of
France, for his singular and rare learning; made Chancellor of Paris, and
Cardinal of Rome: Bule. Cent. 2.
(...) S. Chrysogoni. He writ many admirable profound works, and amongst the
rest, divided the Bible into Chapters: in such sort as we now account them; he
bestowed much upon his palace here in Canterbury, and upon a fair Horologe in
the South-crosse Isle. Yet the solemnity of the translation of Thomas Beckets
bones was so chargeable unto him, Godwin. de P^^sul. Ang.
as neither he, nor four of his successors, were able to recover the debt, he
cast his Church into. He died July 9. 1228. having sat Archbishop 22. years.

Here in this Church, but in what particular place my Author knows not, John
Peckham Archbishop.
John Peckham, sometime Bishop of this See lies buried. This John was borne in
Sussex, spent his childhood in the Abbey of Jews, and was brought up in the
University of Oxford, from thence he went to Paris to study Divinity, and
after that to Livus to get some knowledge in the Canon Law, Godwin. Catal.
without the which Divinity was esteemed imperfect in those days: and to
better his knowledge, he visited all the Universities of Italy, came to Rome,
where, his rare learning being soon perceived, he was made by the Pope,
Auditor, or chief Judge of his palace; and so continued till his preferment
to Canterbury: for a man of so mean parentage, he was thought to be very
stately, both in gesture, gate, words, and all outward show, yet of an
exceeding meek, facile, inward disposition. Unto double Beneficed men, and
Non-residents he was very strict, Adultery he punished very severely; he
persecuted a Bishop terriblie, for keeping of a Concubine: and one Roger Ham a
Priest, he enjoined to three years penance for fornication: a sin
predominant in former times among the Clergy. Witness these rimes.

Great Lechery and fornication
Was in that Harding c 193. King Richards 2

Of Paramours was great consolation
Of each degree, well more of Prelacie
Then of the Temporal, or of the Chivalry.
He excommunicated one Sir Osborne Gifford, Knight, for stealing two Nuns out
of the Nunnerie of Wilton; and absolved him upon these conditions. First, that
he should never come within any Nunnerie, or in the company of a Nun, that
three Sondayes together he should be whipped in the Parish Church of Wilton,
and as many times in the Market, and Church of Shaftsbury; that he should fast
a certain number of months, That he should not wear a shirt of three years:
And lastly, that he should not any more taken upon him the habit or title of a
Knight, but wear apparel of a russet color, until he had spent three years
in the holy Land. He died Ann. 1294. very rich, yet founded a College of
Canons at Wingham in Kent, Wingham C^lledge founded.
valued at 84. l. per annum, and advanced many of his friends to great
possessions, whose posterity have continued in the state of Knights and
Esquires even until our times. He sat Archbishop thirteen years and an
half. ^
His heart was buried at Christ-Church London, retro magnum altar.

Here beside the altar of Saint Gregory, ^
sometime stood a sumptuous Monument, wherein the bones of Robert Winchelsey
were entombed, which upon the reformation of Religion was pulled down to the
ground, lest that the common people, who would needs esteem him a Saint, might
give him divine honors. He sat Archbishop nineteen years, during which
time he endured much sorrow, yet finished his days in quietness^, and great
felicity. (...)
The King and the Pope concurring together in his time, exacted many great
payments, and inflicted grievous punishments upon the Clergy. Whereupon these
Satyricall verses were framed. Ecclesiae nauis titubat regni quia clauis ^

He lived in banishment two years, even until the death of Edward the first,
who exiled him upon surmised Treason, from which he was called home by Edward
his son, who restored him to his place, to all his goods, and to all the
profits of his Temporalities, received in his absence. He was a stout Prelate,
and a severe punisher of sin; he boldly opposed himself against Piers
Gaueston, the Spensers, and other corrupters of the young king; and enforced
John Warren Earl of Surrey, to forswear the company of a certain beautiful
Wench, with the love of which he was greatly be witched. He maintained many
poor Scholars at the Universities with liberal exhibition, and such
preferments as fell to his disposition, he bestowed upon men of excellent
learning. Unto all kind of poor people he was exceeding bountiful: his
books, apparel, and other mou^ables (such as they were; for most of his
yearly revenues he ever bestowed in almsdeeds and liberal house keeping) he
gave to this Church of Canterbury, ^
who l^st to know more of his life may read the Catalogue of Bishops, and the
perambulation of Kent. He died at Otford his Manor house, May (...). 1313.

Here lies entombed Walter Reynolds, ^alter Reynolds Archbishop.
a man but of mean learning; brought up a Courtier, preferred to the
Bishopric of Worcester, to the offices of Lord Chancellor, and Treasurer of
England, and to this Metropolitan honor of Canterbury by King Edward the
second; all which he most disloyally and like a Traitor requited, aiding
(underhand) the Queen, Mortimer, and their accomplices, with great sums of
money, and forsaking his lawful Sovereign, his Master, his Patron, that had
advanced him by so many degrees, unto an estate so graciously honorable; but
it pleased God that unthankful timerousnesse should be his destruction, for
being by the said Queen (of whom he stood so greatly in awe) commanded to
consecrate one James Berkley, (...)
Bishop of Exceter: and performing the same, he was so reviled, taunted, and
threatened by the Pope, that for grief and anger together he died, when he had
sat Archbishop thirteen years, nine months and three weeks, the 16. of
November, Ann. 1327. as appears by this inscription upon his Tomb in the
South wall, now hardly to be read.

Hic requiescit Dominus Walterus Reynolds prius Episcopus Wigorniensis, and
Anglie Cancellarius, deinde Archiepiscopus istius Ecclesie qui obijt 16. die
men's. Nouembris Ann. gratie 1327.

Simon Mepham Archbishop.
Upon the North side of Saint Anselmes Chapel, in a marble Tomb, lies Simon
Mepham Archbishop of this See, borne in this country, Doctor of Divinity, and
very well learned (as learning went in those days) of whom I find little
worthy of relation; for all the time he sat (which was but five year and
somewhat more) he was ever a wrangling with his Monks of this Church, and with
Io. Graundison Bishop of Exceter; and getting the worse by both, he fell sick
and died, October 12. 1333.

John Stratford Archbishop.
Here in a goody Tomb of Alabaster on the South side of the high Altar, lies
the body of John Stratford, Archbishop of this Diocese, borne at Stratford
upon Avon: a man famous for his learning, and good government of his
jurisdiction. He was called from the Sea of Winchester to this place; he was
Lord Chancellor of England, and protector of the Realm, in the absence of
Edward the third in France; but never man enjoyed such great honors with less
comfort. Antiq. Britan.
It is written that he was consecrated upon the Sunday, called then, Multae
tribulationes iustorum, which he thought boaded or foretold unto him, how in
the whole course of his life, he should find nothing but trouble; which sell
out according to his ominous conceit. For never any Archbishop, either before
or after him, giving so little cause, and doing his endeavor to please, was
more encombred with undeserved and often crosses. Godwin
The story is ouer-long here to relate, I must refer my Reader to the
Catalogue of Bishops. Yet before his end (which happened Anno 1348. having
been Archbishop 15. years) he had made an end of all his troublesome crosses,
and lived certain years quietly; they writ of him that he was a very gentle
and merciful man, ^
rather too remiss then any way rigorous to offenders, and a pitiful man to
the poor. He founded a College at Stratford upon Avon, and endowed the same
largely.

John (...) Arc^bishop.
Here lies obscurely buried John Vfford, brother to that illustrious Knight of
the Garter, Robert de Vfford, Earl of Suffolk: brought up in Cambridge, and
made Doctor of Law, promoted first unto the Deanrie of Lincoln, then to the
Chancellourship of England, and lastly to this Archbishopricke. Which he never
enjoyed, being cut off by that plague (which consumed nine parts of the men in
England) before he received either his pall, or consecration, June the
seventh, Ann. 1348.

His next successor, Thomas Bradwardin, lies buried in the South wall,
somewhat darkly; Thomas (...) Arch^^ishop.
preferred to his grace and dignity, without his own seeking, or any of his
friends endeavors; which he likewise enjoy but a very little time. For within
five weeks and four days after his consecration, he died at Lambeth (being
never enthronised at all) Ann. 1349 This man was borne at Heathfeild in Sussex,
and brought up in the University of Oxford, where he proceeded Doctor of
Divinity; and so exquisite a Divine he was, ^.
that he was commonly enstiled Doctor Profundus. He was a good Mathematician, a
great Philosopher, and a general Scholar in all the liberal Sciences, as his
works not yet perished do testify. In whole praise thus Chaucer speaks in
the Nuns Priests tale. But I ne cannot boult it to the bren,
As can the holy Doctor Saint Austin,
Or Boece or the Bishop Bradwardin.
But above all, he is especially commended for his sincerity of life and
conversation. He was Confessor to Edward the third, and in all his wars of
France, was never from him; and though he might have had many preferments of
the King, yet he was so far from ambitious desire of promotion, as it was
long before he could be persuaded to take a Prebend of Lincoln, when it was
offered him. Well we will leave him to his rest, only remembered with this
Epitaph.

Simon Islip brought up in Merton College in Oxford, Simon Islip Archbishop.
being Doctor of Law became Canon of Paul's, then Deane of the Arches, after
that was chosen to be of the privy Council to King Edward the third; first in
the place of Secretary, and then Keeper of the privy Seal And lastly, by the
Monks election, the Popes approbation, and the Kings good liking; he was
advanced to this grace and dignity. Wherein he continued sixteen years,
four months, and twelve days: and died April 26. 1366. he lies buried in
the middle of the Church, under a marble Tomb inlaid with brass, whereon is
engraven this Epitaph.

He was a very severe corrector of sin, depriving many Clergymen of their
livings, in the first visitation of his own Diocese. He repaired his palace,
with 1101. l. and odd money, which he recovered of Andrew Vfford, Archdeacon
of Midlesex, admin^stratour of John Vfford his predecessor, for dilapidations,
Godw^n.
he built and endowed with good possessions a College in this City, which is
now become a parcel of Christ-church in Oxford. He bequeathed to his Church a
thousand sheep, his vestments, which were all cloth of gold, a very sumptuous
Coape, and much plate; he was a very ^^ugall and sparing man, never esteeming
pomp nor outward bravery, which he showed at his end, desiring to be buried
obscurely to avoid superfluous expense.

William Wittle^ey Archbishop
William Wittlesey succeeded the said Simon, and was brought up at Oxford, at
the charges of Simon Islip who was his Uncle, where he proceeded Doctor of the
Canon Law, and by him sent to Rome to solicit his causes, and also to get
experience by seeing the practice of that Court: who after he had stayed there
a time was called home, and preferred by his Uncles means, unto the place of
Vicar general, then to the Deanrie of the Arches, the Archdeaconrie of
Huntington, the Parsonages of Croydon, and Cliff; to the Bishopric of
Rochester, from thence to Worcester; and lastly (after the decease of his said
Uncle) to this Archbishopricke of Canterbury, in which he continued almost
seven years, being the most of his time troubled with a tedious lingering
disease, whereof he died July 5. 1374. He lies buried over against his Uncle
between two pillars, under a marble Tomb inlaid with brass, which with his
Epitaph is altogether defaced, the brass worn, torn or stolen away; these
few words only remaining.

This is a fragment of an Epitaph, composed to the memory of Simon Tibold, the
son of one Nigellus Tibold, surnamed Sudbury of a Town in Suffolk, where he
was borne; a Doctor of the Canon Law, who by degrees came to this Metropolitan
Grace of Canterbury. A man very wise, learned, eloquent, liberal, merciful,
and wondrous reverend: all which could not deliver him from untimely death. For
he, together with Sir Robert Hales, Lord Prior of Saint John's Jerusalem, and
Chancellor or England, were haled to the Tower Hill, by the Rebels of Kent,
and Essex, with infernal shouts and yells, and there unjustly ( Nam ius
calcatur viol^^tia cum dominatur) and horribly hack^, hewed, and in that
barbarous manner beheaded by these arch Tray^ours, ^
June the fourteenth, the year of our Lord, 1381. and of the reign of that
unfortunate King Richard the second, the fourth; having sat Bishop about six
years. Which lamentable story the Chronicles at large declare. When these
hurly burlies were at an end, the body of this good Archbishop was conveyed to
his own Church, and there honorably inte^^ed upon the South side of the
Altar of Saint Dunstan. This Bishop built the West-gate of this City, and the
wall from that gate unto the North-gate, commonly called by the name of the
long wall, and would have done likewise about all the Town, if he had lived.

The Mayor and the Aldermen once a year used to come solemnly to his Tomb to
pray for his soul, in memory of this his good deed to their City, says
Leland in his Commentaries.

It was the custom of old, and so it is in these days, for men of eminent
rank and quality to have Tombs erected in more places then one; ^
for example and proof of my speech, I find here in this Church a Monument of
Alabaster, at the feet of the black Prince, wherein, both by tradition and
writing, it is affirmed that the bones of William Courtney (the son of Hugh
Courtney, the third of that Christian name, Earl of Devonshire* Archbishop of
this See, lies entombed. And I find another, to the memory of the same man, at
Maidstone here in Kent, wherein (because of the Epitaph) I rather believe that
his body lies buried; Of which hereafter when I come to that Town.

Here lies interred under a fair Monument, Thomas Arund^ll Archbishop.
Thomas Fitz-Alan, or Arundell, the third son of Richard Fitz-Alan, Earl of
Arundell, Warren, and Surrey, by Eleanor his wife, daughter of Henry
Plantaginet, Earl of Lancaster, as I have it in the Catalogue of Honor. Who
at the age of two and twenty years was consecrated Bishop of Ely: An old Bishop
which he laudablie governed (considering the greenness of his age) the space
of fourteen years, three months, and eighteen days. In which time he was
Lord Chancellor of England; from Ely he was translated to York; leaving for
an implement at his house of Ely, a wonderful sumptuous and costly Table,
adorned with gold and precious stones, which belonged first to the King of
Spain, Godwi^.
and was sold to this Bishop by the black Prince for three hundred Marks. He
also bestowed the building of the great Gatehouse of Ely house in Houlborne:
during his abode at York, which was about eight years, he bestowed much in
building upon diverse of his houses, and unto the Church. Besides many rich
ornaments, he gave two great Basins of silver and gilt, two great Censers, two
other Basins of silver, and two Creuetts; he gave to the Vicars, a silver cup
of great weight, and a massy bowl of silver to the Canons. From York he was
removed hither to Canterbury, and here he sat one month above seventeen
years. In which time, at the West end of his Church, he built a fair spi^e
steeple* called to this day, Arundell steeple, and bestowed a tunable ring of
five bells upon the same, Antiq. Britan.
which he dedicated to the holy Trinity, to the blessed Virgin Mary, to the
Angel Gabriel, to Saint Blase, and the fifth to S. John Evangelist. Thus much
he effected: howsoever he was no sooner warm in his seat, Lanquet. Hollins.
then that he with his brother, the Earl of Arundell, were condemned of high
Treason, his brother executed, and he banished the kingdom; and so lived in
exilement the space of near two years, until the first of the reign of
Henry the fourth.

This worthy Prelate died of a swelling in his tongue, which made him unable to
eat, drink, or speak for a time before his death. Which happened Februar.
20. Ann. 1413.

An Author contemporarie with this Archbishop, writes as follows of the
passages in those times, as also much in the grace and commendation of this
worthy Metropolitan.

Io. Gower Cronic. ^ripart. Mss. in bib. Cot.
Heu mea penna madet lachrimis, dum scribere suadet,

O quam preclarus tam purus and immaculatus,

Upon his restoration to this his Bishopric, by Henry the fourth Duke of
Lancaster, the same Author thus writes.

Iustos laudauit, ^
iniustos vituperauit,
Hos confirmauit, hos deprimit, hos releuauis.
Regni primatem crudelem per feritatem
Quem Rex explantat, Dux ex pietate replantat.
Henry Chichley, ^
Bishop of this See, lies here on the North side of the Presbitery, in a Tomb
built by himself in his life time: he was borne at Higham^errys in
Northamptonshire, where he began the foundation of a goodly College, and an
Hospital, which were finished by his two brethren, his Executours. He was
brought up in New College in Oxford, where he proceeded Doctor of Law, and
where he founded two Colleges, one called Bernard College, renewed by Sir
Thomas White, and named Saint John's College: and all Souls College, which
yet continues in the same estate he left it, one of the fairest in that
University. He was employed much in embassages by King Henry the fourth, who
preferred him to the Bishopric of Saint David's; ^
where he sat five years, and was then translated hither by his son King
Henry the fifth. He was a man happy, enjoying always his Princes favor,
wealth, honor, and all kind of prosperity many years, wise in governing his
See worthily, bountiful in bestowing his goods to the behoof of the
commonwealth. And lastly stout and severe in due administration of justice.
When he had governed this Sec. 29. years (a longer time then ever any did in
five hundred years before him) he died April 12. Ann. 1443. Upon whose
Monument I find this Epitaph.

I find another more unlearned Epitaph of him, by which he is but little
honored, being such an especial furtherer of learning.

John Stafford Archbishop.
Here lies interred in the Martyrdom an Archbishop, very noble, and no less
learned, one of the honorable family of the Staffords; son (says the
Catalogue of Bishops) unto the Earl of Stafford, but I find no such thing in
all the Catalogues of Honor; a man much favored by King Henry the fifth, woe
preferred him first to the Deanrie of Wells, gave him a Prebend in the Church
of Salisbury, made him one of his privy Council, and in the end Treasurer of
England. And then although this renowned King was taken away by untimely death,
yet he still went forward in the way of promotion, and obtained the
Bishopric of Bath and Wells, which with great wisdom he governed
eighteen years, from whence he was removed to this of Canterbury, in which he
sat almost nine years; and in the mean time was made Lord Chancellor of
England, which office he held eighteen years (which you shall hardly find
any other man to have done) until waxing weary of so painful a place, he
voluntarily resigned it over into the Kings hands. And about three years after
that died at Maidstone, July 6. Ann. 1452. Upon a flat marble stone over him I
find this consabulatorie Epitaph.

Quis fuit enuclees quem celas saxe^ moles?
Stafford Antistes. fuerat dictusque Johannes.
Qua sedit sede marmor queso simul ede?
Pridem Bathonie, Regni totius and inde
Primas egregius. Pro presule funde precatus
Aureolam gratus huic det de Virgin natus.
Much more may be read of this Bishop in the book called, Antiquitates
Britannicae, penned by Matthew Parker, Archbishop of this place, and in the
Catalogue of Bishops, by Francis Godwin, Bishop of Hereford* as also in the
Catalogues of the Lords Chancellours and Treasurers of England, collected by
Francis Thin.

In a decent Monument on the South side of the Presbitery, John Kempe,
Archbishop of this See, John Kempe Archbishop.
lies interred, who was borne at Wye in this County of Kent, brought up at
Oxford in Merton College, where he proceeded Doctor of Law. He was made
first Archdeacon of Durham, then Deane of the Arches, and Vicar general unto
the Archbishop Stafford. Not long after he was advanced to the Bishopric of
Rochester, removed thence to Chichester, from Chichester to London, from London
to York, from York to Canterbury: he was first Cardinal of the title of
Saint Balbine, and from that removed to the title of Saint Rusine; all which
his Ecclesiastical preferments were comprehended in this one verse, composed
by his cousin Thomas Kempe, Bishop of London. Bis Primas ter Praesul erat, bis
Cardine functus. ^

And to add to all these honors, he was twice Lord Chancellor of England. He
continued not here above a year and a half, but died a very old man, March
22. 1453. he converted the Parish Church of Wye into a College of secular
Priests. Of which hereafter.

In a little history of the Archbishops of York, written in rythmicall
numbers, I find these in his commendations.

Tunc Johannes nobilis Kemp vociferatus, ^

Prius in Londonijs Presul installatus.
Et erectus Pontifex Metropolitanus.
Presul Archipresulem confirmat Romanus,
Mandans sibi pallium Martinus; erectus
Sagax Cancellarius Regis est effectus.
Cardinalis Presbiter digne sublimatur.
Sub Balbine Titulo, sic laus cumulatur.
In Suthwell manerium fecit preciosum,
Multis artificibus valde sumptuosum,
Annis multis prospere curam sui gregis,
Rexit per iusticiam, and per normam legis.
Tandem vsque Cantiam Presul est translatus
Illic Archiepiscopus est inthronizatus
Apud Lambeth obijt labor iam finitur,
Et in Cantuaria corpus sepelitur,
Licet prohibuerit Abbas rigorose
Iacet ibi condita gleba gloriose.
I find little of any great work or deed of charity this Bishop performed
(besides his Manor of Suthwell here only mentioned) with all these his
pennisome preferments. but the reason is given in the Catalogue of Bishops,
that he died very rich, and that in his life time he advanced many of his
kindred to great wealth, and some to the dignity of knighthood, whose
posterity continued yet in this County, of great worship and reputation, even
to this day. That he might die very rich I do not deny, but for the
advancement of his kindred to the honor of knighthood, was no other title then
his grandfather Sir John Kempe, and his Uncle Sir Roger enjoyed: his own
father Thomas being a younger brother to the said Sir Roger.

Here lies buried (as by an inscription upon a marble does appear) Thomas
Bourchier, Tho (...) Archbishop.
commonly called Bowser, second son of William Bourchier, Earl of Ewe in
Normandy, and brother to Henry Bourchier Earl of Ewe and Essex. He was
brought up in Oxford (...) preferred to the Deanrie of Saint Martins, then to
the Bishop^^^^^ o^ Worcester, from whence he was translated to Ely; and (...)
in this chair of Canterbury, wherein he sat 32. years, and (...) the time of
his first consecration 51. years. I find not (...) Englishman continued so
long a Bishop, or that any Archbishop, (...) before or after him, in eight
hundred years enjoyed that place so long. And to add more honor to his
Grace, and money to his purse, he was about two years Lord Chancelour of
England, (...) ^atal. of Chancellor.
and Cardinal tt. S. Ciriaci in Thermis, ^^t all this time for all these great
and eminent promotions, he left nothing behind him to continue his memory,
but an old rotten chest in the congregation house at Cambridge, called
Billingsworth and Bowser, into which (for the use of the University)
Billingsworth before him had put in one hundred pounds, and he (forsooth)
imitating that munificent example, put in one hundred and twenty pounds. He
died March 30. 1486. as appeared by (...) ption upon his Monument.

Hic iacet reuerendissimus pater and Dominus D. Thomas (...) quo^dam
sacrosancte Roman Ecclesie S. Ciriaci in Thermi (...) chiepiscopus huius

John Morton Archbishop:
Here lies buried under a marble stone, in a sumptuous Chapel under the
Quier, of his own building, John Morton, borne (to the good of all England) at
Beer (at Saint Andrews Milborn, ^^md. Dorset.
says Camde^) in Dorsetshire, brought up in Oxford, where he proceeded Doctor
of the Civil and Canon Law; he was first Parson of Saint Dunstans in London,
and Prebendarie of Saint Decumanes in Wales, then Bishop of Ely, Master of the
Rolls, Lord Chancellor of England, Cardinal of Saint Anastatia, and
Archbishop of this Metropolitan See. A man so well deserving both of the Church
and commonwealth, that all honors and offices were too little which were
conferred upon him: of a piercing natural wit he was, very well learned, and
honorable in behavior, lacking no wise ways to win love and favor, by
whose deep wisdom and policy, the two houses of York and Lancaster (whose
titles for a long time had mightily disquieted the whole kingdom) were happily
united; but our English Chronicles are so full and copious in this Bishops
commendation, as that I know not where to begin with him, nor how to take my
leave of him.

Whilst he was Bishop of Ely (which was about eight years) he bestowed great
cost upon his house at Hatfield in Hertfordshire, Antiq. Britan.
(now the mansion place of that right honorable Lord, and one of the privy
Council, William Cecill, Earl of Salisbury) and at Wisbich Castle in
Cambridgeshire (a house belonging to that See) all the bricke-building was done
at his charges And in the time of his Primacie in this Church, he bestowed
great sums in repairing and augmenting his houses at Knoll, Maydstone, Godwin.
Alington Park, Charing, Ford, Lambith, and Canterbury. He bequeathed by his
last Will, in a manner, all that he had, either unto good uses, or to such of
his servants as he had yet been able to do nothing for. He gave to the King a
Portuis, to the Queen a (...), to the ^^dy Margaret his God daughter
(afterward married to (...), King of Scotland) a cup of gold, and tourry
p^unds in (...) Church of Ely, his Myter and Crolle; unto his (...) and (...)

these lines following serve for an Eulogium or Epitaph.

Bangor, which had been burned and destroyed long before by Owen Glendow^, that
famous rebell^ during the time he sat here Archbishop (which was scarce two
years) h^ built the most part of Otford house, and made the iron work upon
the coping of Rochester Bridge. He bequeathed to his Church a silver image, of
one and fifty ounces weight, and appointed five hundred pounds to be bestowed
upon his funerals. He died, Februar. the fifteenth, at Lambith* Ann. 1502. as
appears by his Epitaph.

find in that Church-windowes, and Master of the Rols. He was sent Ambassador
by Henry the seventh, to the Duke of Burgundy, concerning the two counterfeits,
Lambert, and Perkin Warbeck, which the Duchess his wife had set up against
him. In which business he behaved himself so wisely, as the King highly
comm^nded him, and preferred him upon his return, to the Bishopric of
London; and upon the death of Henry Deane, to this of Canterbury. He was also
made Lord Chancellor of England by the same King; in which office he
continued, until he was wrung out by Wolsey, Mat. Pa^ke^. Antiq. B^itan.
the seventh of Henry the eight. The ceremony of his inthronization to
Canterbury was performed in a most magnificent manner: the Duke of Buckingham,
and many other great men of the kingdom being that day his officers. In his
solemn and sumptuous feast, all his honors and offices were drawn, depicted,
or delineated, after a strange manner, in gilded Marchpaine upon the banqueting
dishes: and first because he was brought up in the University of Oxford, the
Vicechancelour with the Bedels before him, and a multitude of Scholars
following him, were described to present to the King and the Nobility, sitting
in Parliament, this William Warham with this laudatorie Tetrasticon.

Deditus a teneris studijs hic noster alum^us,
Morum et Doctrinae tantum profecit, vt Aulam
Illustrare tuam, curare negotia Regni
(Rex Henrice) tui possit honorifice.
Which the King seems to answer thus.

Tales esse decent quibus vti sacra maiestas
Regnum in tutando debeat imperio.
Quare suscipiam quem commendastis Alumnum
Digna daturus ei praemia pro meritis.
Rolls sometime a house of Conuert^, dedicated to the blessed Virgin.
Then these verses upon his preferment to the Mastership of the Rolls.

Est locus egregius tibi virgo sacrata dicatus,

Commendo fidei scrinia sacra suae.
Then upon his advancement to London these. Vrbis Londini cap^^ O duleiss^me

And again. Hic nisi praeclara morum indole praeditus esset,

Then of his consecration and installation to this See, many verses were
composed to explain the Artifice, to this effect.

The words at the delivery of the Pall to him, or to any other Bisho^ were
these.

The cross was delivered unto him by a Monk of this his Church in these words.

Godwin.
Reverend Father, I am the messenger of the great King, that does require and
command you to take on you the government of his Church, and to love and defend
the same, in token whereof, I deliver you this his ensign. But I doubt I am
tedious, I will draw to his end, which happened, August 23. 1532. after he had
continued Archbishop eight and twenty years, and was buried without any great
funeral pomp, mourning clothes being given only to the poor. He purchased
much land for his kindred, and bestowed very much in repairing and beautifying
his houses with fair buildings, even to the value of thirty thousand pounds,
as he professes; for which cause he prayed his Successors to forbear suit
for dilapidations. His motto I find in many places of the palace, which was,
Auxilium meum a Domino.

I find no more Archbishops to be here buried, save Cardinal Poole, whom I
reserve for another book.

Sir William Molyneux Knight Banneret.
Here sometimes was a monument erected to the memory of that valiant Knight, Sir
William Molyneux, of Seston in Lanchishire, who at the battle of Nauarret in
Spain, was made knight Banneret, by Edward the black Prince, Anno 1367. under
whose command he served in those wars, as also for a long time, in the wars
of France. From whence returning homewards, he died here at Canterbury, Anno
1372. Whose Epitaph I have out of the pedigree of that honorable worthy
gentleman, Sir Richard Molyneux of Seston, Knight and Baronet, and Viscount
Marybourgh in Ireland, now living, who from the said Sir William is lineally
descended.

Miles honorificus Molyneus subiacet intus;

Camden tells us that this family of the Guildfords is very ancient, but most
eminent, ever since this Sir John Guilford (here interred) was Controuler to
the house to King Edward the fourth; whose son and heir Sir Richard, was, by
King Henry the seventh, made Knight of the Garter: of his sons again Sir
Edward Guilford was Marshall of Callais, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and
Master of the Ordnance, father to I^ne Duchess of Northumberland, wife to Sir
John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, mother of the late Earls of Wa^wick, and
Leicester; of Guilford Dudley, beheaded with his wife the Lady Jane; and of
five sons and eight daughters besides: and Sir Henry was chosen Knight of the
Garter by King Henry the eight, and had his arms ennobled with a Canton of
Granado by Ferdinando, King of Spain, for his worthy service in that kingdom,
when it was recovered from the Moors; and Edward lived in great esteem in his
country: To be brief, from this Sir John Guilford are issued by females
immediately, the Darells, Gages, Brew^es, Walsinghams, ^
Cromers, Isaacs, and Iselcies, families of prime and principal note in these
parts. But I digress, and I crave pardon. Only let me tell you, that Sir
Richard Guilford, aforesaid, served King Henry the seventh, s^pra mare cum 550.

a name both of antiquity and eminency, one of which family, namely, Sir
John Fogge, was of the privy Council to King Edward the fourth, and sat with
the Duke of Clarence, the Earl of Warwick, and the Lord Rivers in judgment,
upon Sir Thomas Cook of Giddie-Hall in Essex. And I find one Sir John Fogge,
a warrior, in the beginning of the reign of King Henry the eight. But this
great conquering Knight did flourish long before: he was the son of Sir
Thomas Fogge knight, buried at Glastenbury, by his wife the Countess of Ioyeux
in France. And this Ioane his wife here buried, was the daughter and heir of
Valons, or Valance.

testify) Ethelbert, king of Kent, received the lauer of Baptism in Saint
Martins Church, ^
at the hands of Saint Augustine: within two years after that, he began the
foundation of this Monastery. As I have it out of this his Charter, in the red
book of Canterbury.

relics of Saints which he had brought with him from Rome; amongst which was
a part of Christ's seamelesse Cote, and of Aarons Rod.

And here by the way observe, that Austin sealed his deeds or charters, bulla
plumbea, Harsfeld Hist. (...) Angl. Sex. S^cul.
with a leaden Bull, which many ages afterward, Richard Archbishop of
Canterbury, went about to infringe and infirm, Quod is signandi modus Romany

England the like Bull of a certain Bishop, by which he and the Bishops before

were restored back again to this Abbey by the Conqueror. Whose letters

But this Abbey was endowed with ample revenues by many others, so that being
valued at the dissolution, like the rest of all such religious foundations at a
favorable and far vnder-rate, it amounted to be yearly worth 1412. l. 4.
s. 7 d. ob. q. It was surrendered 4. December. 29. Hen. 8. Saint Austine
replenished this house with black Monks, Benedictines, and ordained it to be
the place of Sepulture for the kings of Kent, for himself, and all succeeding
Archbishops. The first king here interred, was the foresaid Ethelbert, who,
after he had gloriously reigned the space of 56. years, ^
and had enlarged the frontiers of his Empire, as far as the great River
Humber, entered into the eternal bliss of the kingdom on heaven. The year of
our redemption 616. and in the 13 year after he had received the Christian
faith. As I find it in this old Manuscript.

Ethelbert cleped the hely king of Kent ^

In the yer of grace six hundryd and sixtene
Deide, and of Christendom the xxi y wene.
Six and fifty Winter he had regnyd her
And aftur Edbald his son regne began there.
He was buried on the North side of the Church, upon whose Monument this
Epitaph was engraven.

Rex Ethelbertus hic clauditur in Polyandro,
Fana pians certe Christo meat absque Meand^^.
King Ethelbert lies here closde in this Polyander,
For building Churches sure he goes to Christ without Meander.
Berta his wife was here likewise interred, ^
who was the daughter of Chilperick, king of France, who was grandchilde to
Clouis, the first Christian king of that famous nation; this woman was
converted to Christianity before she came out of her own country, and before
Austins arrival here in England, Beda. lib. (...) 25.26.
and was married to king Ethelbert, with these conditions made by her parents.
That it should be lawful for her to keep inviolable the rites of her
Religion, and enjoy the presence and instructions of her learned Bishop
Luitharde, whom they appointed to assist and help her in matters of her faith.
She was a woman of virtuous and holy inclination, spending much of her time in
prayer, almsdeeds, and other works of charity; frequenting daily her
Oratorie, within Saint Martins, a Church built in former times by the believing
Romans; wherein her reverend assistant Luitardus used also to instruct, and
exhort the people to newness of life, and Religion: so that by her example,
and his preaching, many of the Kentish Paynims were brought in, to believe the
glad tidings of the Gospel. These proceedings with his wives persuasions,
wrought so effectually with good king Ethelbert, that his heart was softened,
and his ears already opened to receive and embrace the doctrine of S. Austine.
Whereupon some do gather, that the happiness of his, and his Subjects
conversion may as well be attributed to Berta, Will. Malmes. de gestis Rev, lib.
1. ca. 1. Speed. Hist.
and her French attendants, as to Austine and his fellow-disciples. Of which an
old namelesse Rimer very ancient.

When Ethilbert had reigned bot a yer,
Sent Awstyn him to Christian feyth convert,
Thrughe goddys grase, as clerly did apere,
Who had to wyffe Berta, that was advert
To Christian feyth, in France before convert;
That helped thereto with all hur dylygens
As Awstyn did with all benyvolens.
She was likewise an earnest parswader, and a pertaker with her husband
Ethelbert in and for the propagating and erecting of Religion, and religious
structures; as I observe out of the same Author. King Ethilbert with ryall
great expens
Great Mynsters made of high reuyrens
In Rochestre and eke in Canterbery
For Bysschoppys sees, that were full necessary*
At London eke sent Pawles edyfyed,
In which so then should be the Bysschoppys Se,
Thus hely C^yrch tha P^yns there fortyfyed
With all kind thing that was necessary,
For sustenauns of the Christyante.
So did his wyff hur part with all hur might,
To fortefy the christian in th^yr right.
This blessed Queen died before her husband, near unto whom he desired to be
buried, ann. 622. for whom this Distich was composed. Moribus ornata iacet hic
Regina beata
Berta, Deo grata fuit ac homini peramata.


Edbald king of Kent.
Here sometime lay the body of Edbald entombed, king of Kent, the son and
heir of the before named Ethelbert, by his Queen Berta; who began his reign
as wickedly as his father ended his worthily: for he refused to entertain the
doctrine of Christ, Beda li. 2. cap. 5.
and polluted himself by the marriage of his mother in law, his own fathers
second wife: but at length being converted by Archbishop Lawrence, from his
idolatry, and incestuous matrimony, he endeavored by all means possible to
propagate and maintain the state of the Gospel. The king of Kent Edbald his
furst wife forsook
R^b. Glocest.
And held him to his Christendom yat he furst took.
And built a Chapel within this Monastery, in honor of Mary the blessed
mother of God, endowing it with sufficient maintenance, wherein after the
continuance of 24. years reign, Emma the wif^ of K. Edbald
he was buried, ann. 640. His wife Emma the daughter of Theodebert, king of
Lorraine was buried by him.

Ercombert kin^ of Kent, and Sexburgh his wife.
Here lies Ercombert the son of the said Edbald, king of Kent, a religious
king; who suppressed all the Temples of the heathen Idols, and commanded the
fast of Lent to be observed. His wife Sexburgh, daughter of Anna king of the
East Angles was laid by him; Beda. li. 2. cap. 8
This King having reigned four and twenty years and odd months, finished
his days, ann. 664.

Egbert king of Kent.
Egbert succeeded his father Ercombert; and if the murder of his two
cosin-Germans had not much blemished his peaceable government, he might well
have holden place with the worthiest of the Kentish kings. Will. Malmes. de

He died in the tenth year of his reign, anno 673. and was buried here by his
predecessors.

And so in like manner this Church was honored with the sepulchers of Lothaire,
Withred, Edelbert and other Kentish kings, and also with the shrines of many
English Saints, whose sacred Relics (as they were then esteemed) brought both
great ve^^ration and bencht to this relig^ou^ Structure.

The first man of eminency that I find to have b^ene e^shrined in this Abbey,
^
was Saint Augustine, the first Archbishop of this See of Canterbury; a Roman
borre, and a Monk of Saint Benets order, who, with others, was sent hither out
of Italy, by Gregory the great, Pope of Rome, to preach the word of God to
this our English nation; ^
he with his fellows, to the number of forty persons, landed in the Isle of
Tenet within this County; where they were shortly after visited of king
Ethelbert But the story is frequent, and I shall be often touching upon it by
the way, and hi^ Legend is too long for my intended short discourse; therefore
I hope the Reader will rest contented with this abbreuiation for both.

Whils Ethelbert was reignyng king of Kent ^

Saint Austin sent by Gregory of R. bishop
Landed in Tenet, with Clerks of his assent,
And many Monks to teach the says I hope,
That clothed were under a black cope:
Which in Procession, with crosses and Bells came,
The Latinies syngyng in Jesus his name*
In the year of Christ his incarnacion,
Five hundredth fourscore and sixtene;
King Ethelbert had in his dominacion
Al^ Kent throughout, with great joy as was seen
Were baptized then in holy water clean,
To whom Gregory sent Mellito and Iusto
With other Clerks and Doctors many mo.
Gregory him made Archbishop of Canterbury,
Of all England hiest then Primate:
And had the Pa^^.
Paul with hiest legacye
By Gregory sent to him and ordinate.
Fro London then thus was that time translate
To Canterbury, the sea Metropolitan
And London set as for his suffrigan.
Saint Augustine then with help of Ethelbert
Saint Augustines made, and Christ's Church also
That Christ's Church hight as it was adverte
And sacred so by him, and hallowed tho
For the chief Sea Metropolitan so
Of all England by Gregory ordinate,
And Saint Augustine of all England Primate.
This man was of an exceeding tall stature, well favored, of a very amiable
countenance, but of his learning, I find little worthy of remembrance: sine
doctrina sana docebat (says one) ac sine perceptibili lingua ignotae
praedicabat genti. Bal^. Centur. prima.
He died the 26. of May, in the thirteenth year of his first entrance into
England, and was buried first without doors, near to the Church of this
Monastery, because the Church was not finished: and afterward his body was
removed into the North Porch of the said Church; in which place five of his
Successors were likewise interred. Upon the Tomb of this Austine this Epitaph
was insculped in Latin: thus translated.

Here rests the body of Augustine, the first Archbishop of Canterbury, that
was sent into this Land by Saint Gregory, Bishop of Rome, approved of God by
working of miracles, and that brought Ethelbert the king and his people from
the worshipping of Idols, unto the faith of Christ; the days of whose office
being ended in peace, he deceased, May 26. the said king Ethelbert yet reigning.

^
But from the Porch his body was removed into the Church, for in the year of
our salvation 1221.5. Kalend. Maij. John de Marisco* then Prior of this
Monastery, with the rest of his Covent, being desirous to know the place where
the body of this Archbishop their patron, was deposited (after fasting and
prayer) caused a wall to be broken near to Saint Austins Altar, where they
found a Tomb of stone, sealed and close sh^t up with ^on, and lead, having
this Inscription.

Inclitus Anglorum Presul pius, et decus altum;
Hic Augustinus requiescit corpore sanctus.
And in the year 1300.3. Kal. Augusti, Thomas Findon (then being Abbot)
enshrined his relics in a more sumptuous manner, adding another Distich to
the former, expressing his affectionate love to the said Saint Austin his
patron.

Inclitus Anglorum Presul pius, and decus altum;
Hic Augustinus requiescit corpore sanctus.
Ad tumulum landis Patris almi ductus amore,
Abbas hunc tumulum Thomas dictauit honor.
But for the continuance of this man's memory, this Monastery it self
(howsoever demolished) surpasses all funeral Monuments, Inscriptions, or
Epitaphs; for in regard he was the procurer of the building thereof, the names
of Saint Peter and Paul are now (and were many hundred years since, quite
forgotten) and the whole fabric called only S. Austins.

Austin a little before his death, consecrated his companion Lawrence,
Archbishop of this See, the next to succeed him in his government, lest either
by his own death (as Lambard observes) or want of another fit man to fill the
place, the chair might happily be carried to London, as Gregory the Pope had
appointed. Of which consecration my foresaid Manuscript.

Than Awstyn made Lawrence Archebysschop thar
Whyls that he was on lyve for he would nowght
It vacond werk ne void when he deed war,
So mykell than on yt he set his thowght
Of covetyse of good, nothing he rowght
Ne of Estate ne yet of dygnyte
But only of the Church and cristente.
Lawrence (by allusion to his name cal^ed L^urige^) thus conse(...)ceeded the
said Augustine, ^
and being archbishop, (...) exhortation, by works of charity, and (...), and
by (...) a godly life, to continue and increase the number of Christian (...).
And like a true Pastor and Prelate, solicitously care^, not ^nely (...) the
Church of the Englishmen, but also for the old inhabitants of (...), of
Scotland, and Ireland, amongst whom the sparkles of Christianity were already
kindled. The foundations of this Church being now well (...) strongly laid,
the maine thing that thwarted his religious designs* (...), that Edbald king
of Kent, would not with all his godl^ exhorta^^ons (...)ing a vicious young
man) be brought from his Paganism, to believe in the only everliving God. And
that his people following the example o^ (...) king, returned ^ikewise to the
filthy vomit of their abominable Idola^^^e. Lawrence perceiving at last, that
neither his reprehensions nor fair words took any effect, but rather incited
the King and the Subject to a more des^perate hatred of him, and of his
Religion, determined to depart the kingdom, to follow Bishop Iusto and ^ellite
before banished, and to recommend the charge of his flock to God, the careful
Shepherd of all men's souls But the night before the day of his intended
departure (says Beda) Saint Peter appeared unto him in his sleep, Beda li. 2.
ca. 6
and reprehended him sharply, for purposing to run away, and to leave the
sheep of Jesus Christ, beset in the midst of so many Wolfes; he challenged
him with Apostolical authority, argued with him a long while very vehemently,
and, among all, scourged him naked so terriblie, as when he waked, finding it
more then a dream, all his body was gore blood. Thus, well whipped, he went to
the king, showing him his stripes, and withal related unto him the occasion of
those so many fearful lashes: which struck such a terror into the king, as
by and by he renounced his Idols, put away his incestuous wife, caused
himself to be baptized. And for a further testimony of his unfeigned
conversion, built a Chapel in this Monastery of Saint Peter. Of which I have
spoken before Of which more succinctly thus in my namelesse Manuscrip^.

For woe of that to god full sore than prayde

This Laurence writ a learned book of the observation of Easter, and some
exhorta^iue Epistles to the Bishops and Abbots of the Scottish, Irish, and
British Churches; beseeching, and praying them to receive and keep the
society of Catholic observation, with that Church of Christ which is spread
over the whole world. He died the same year that Edbald became Christian,
Februar. 3. An. Dom. 619. and was buried in the Church Porch beside Augustine
his predecessor. For whom this Epitaph was composed.

Mellitus, sometime an Abbot of Rome, succeeded Laurence in this grace, and
Ecclesiastical dignity, Mellitus Archbishop.
sent hither by Saint Gregory, to assist Augustine in the service of the Lord,
by whom he was first consecrated Bishop of London; during his abode in that
place, he converted unto the faith of Christ, Sebert king of the East Saxons.

Of London then bishop full virtuous:
A Clerk that was then beneuolous,
Who then converted of Essex the king Sebert,
And all his land baptized with holy heart.
But the wicked sons of this good King Sebert expelled Mellitus out of their
dominions; from whence he traveled into France, and there stayed for a time,
Beda. li. 2 (...)
until he was commanded by Archbishop Laure^ce to ret^^ne and look to his
flock. He was a man noble by birth, but much more noble for the excellency of
his mind; an eloquent speaker; and therefore a^^siuely called of some,
Mellifluous, exceeding careful of his charge, despising the world, and never
caring for any thing but heaven, and heavenly things: Godwin. de P^^^^l. Ang.
having been sick a long time of the Gowt; he died April 24. ann. 624. and
was buried beside his predecessor. Upon whose Tomb this Epitaph was engraven.

Hac titulis clara redoles Mellite sub arca.
Laudibus eternis te predicat vrbs Dorouernis

Presently upon the death of Mellitus, Iustus Archbishop.
Iustus then Bishop of Rochester, was preferred to this Archbishopricke. He was
a Roman borne, the disciple of Gregory the great, by whom he was sent over
into England, to preach the Gospel. Ha^p^feld Hist. Aug. ca. 7.
He was a Monk after the order of Saint Benet: Vir tantae integritatis vi
iusti nomine non tam gentilicio, quam propter virtatem honorandus censeretur.
Which his virtue, as also his learning are both highly commended by Pope
Boniface the fourth, Beda li. 2. ca 8.
to whom, as to his deared beloved Brother, he sends greeting. He died

Pro meritis Iusti sancta grauitate venusti:
Gratia diuinam diuina dat his medicinam.
Honorius a reverend learned man, Honorius Archbishop.
borne in the same City, brought up under the same Master, and one of the same
order with Iustus, succeeded him in his pontifical Government. During the time
he sat, which was somewhat above twenty years, Beda. li. ^. ca 9.
amongst other things, he appointed diverse Bishops to diverse countries, and
divided his Province into Parishes, of which I have spoken before, that so he
might appoint particular Ministers or Priests, to particular congregations. In
his time the Pelagian heresy began to spring up again in Scotland; but by his
exhortatorie divine Epistles to the Clergy of that kingdom, he so dealt, that
the poisonous infection of that contagious heresy spread not far, neither
continued any long time. He died Februar. 28. Ann. 653. and was laid with his
predecessors. This was his Epitaph.

Quintus honor memori versu memoraris Honori
Digna sepultura, quam non teret vlla Litura:
Ardet in obscuro tua lux vibramine puro
Hec scelus omne premit, fugat vmbras, nubila demit.
One Frithona (famous for his learning and virtuous life) being elected
Archbishop, Deus dedit Archbishop.
upon the day of his consecration changed his name, for Deus dedit, or
Adeodatus. He was the first Englishman that governed this See: which charge he
attended carefully the space of six years, and dyed July ^4. Ann. 664. being
the very same day that Ercombert the king of Kent dyed; he was the last Bishop
buried in the Church Porch. Such was his Epitaph.

Alme Deus Dedit cui sexta v^catio cedit,

Qu^ melioratur quic(...) gra^atur.
Theodore Archbishop.
Theodore a Grecian, Saint Paul's (...), borne in Tharsus, succeeded Deus de^it.
He was sixt^e six year^^ of age before he undertook the charge of this
Archbishopricke, in (...) he continued two years, three months, twenty seu^n
days, until (...), which happened Sept. 29. anno 690 A man he was (to omit
particulars) worthy of perpetual remembrance for his singular virtues, Bed^.
li. 5. cap 8. Edem ^ib. 4. ca. 2.
under whom the Church of England received much comfort and increase in
spiritual matters. He was excee^dingly well learned, both in profane and holy
literature: he would often visit the country of the Englishmen all over, and
teach them the waye^ and paths of good life. He was the first Archbishop unto
whom all the whole Church of the English Nation did yield, and consent to
submit themselves; He writ many learned books, mentioned by B^^e; he was the
seventh Archbishop, of whom these verses were written upon the wall in Latin,
now translated thus into English.

Seven Patriarchs of England, Primates seven,
Seven Rectors, and seven Seven stars in Charles waine.
Babaurers in heven,
Seven Cesterns pure of life, seven Lamps of light
Seven Palms, and of this Realm seven Crowns full bright,
Seven Stars are here interred in vault below.
Harpsfe^d. ca. 8 (...). 7.
These verses were common to a^l these seven pillars of the English Church, for
so they are called; yet every one, as you have read, had his particular
Epitaph, and this following went curiant for Theodore, thus Englished by the
Translatour of venerable Bede.

Beda ^i. 5. cap. 8.
A worthy Prelate lies here, fast closed in this grave,
To whom the name of Theodore the Greeks most justly gave,
With title right the sovereignty having of each degree.
Christ's flock he fed with true doctrine, as all men do well see,
His soul was set at liberty (that lumpish lump of clay
Dissolved) when September had put nineteen days away.
And coveting their fellowship that live a godly life,
Is companied with Angels high, void of all care and strife.
Brithwald Archbishop.
Brithwald (called like others allusiuely Bright world) Abbot of Reculuer, some
two years after the decease of Theodore, was elected and consecrated
Archbishop, by one Godwin, Metropolitan of France. He was a man very well
learned, both in Divinity and humanity, and very skillful both in
Ecclesiastical and Monastical orders, censures, and disciplines, but far
inferior in all unto his predecessor He continued Archbishop in this f^^med,
seven and thirty years, six months, fourteen days: a longer time then
ever any did either before or since; and dyed Ianuar. 9. ann 731. and was
buried in this Abbey Church: because the Porch was already filled with the dead
bodies of his predecessors: for whom this Epitaph was (...), and engraven upon
his Monument.

Stat sua laus feretro Brithwaldus stat sua metro
Sed minor est metri laus omnis laud feretri.
Laud frequentandus, pater hic and glorificandus;
Si pr^ce slectatur, dat ei qui danda precatur.
Tatwin a man very religious, ^
and no less learned, succeeded Brithwald; soon after whose consecration,
great controversy arose between him and the Archbishop of York, about the
Primacie: wherein Tatwin prevailed. Who having sat only three years, died
July the last day, An. Dom. 735. and was buried here in the Church by his
predecessor. To whose memory this Epitaph was cut upon the stone coffin.

Paul's, a great lover of venerable antiquity he was, ^
and one to whom Bid acknowledg^th himself to be much beholding for diverse
matters; which, upon his ^^port, he inserted into his Ecclesiastical History.
He died October 17. An. 74^. His Epitaph was after this manner.

Hac scrobe Nothelmus iacet Archiepiscopus almus. ^

Cuius vita bono non est indigna patrono.
Cunctis iste bonus par in bonitate Patronus
Protegit hic iustos vigili munimine Custos.
Cutbert Archbishop of Canterbury, not long before this time had procured of
king Eadbert, ^
that the bodies of all the Archbishops which were to succeed, should not be
buried at Saint Augustines, as they had been heretofore, but at Christ-Church;
and so, according to his desire, the ^uneralls of himself, and his successor
Bregwin, were there solemnised, and their bodies therein interred. The Monks
of Saint Austins took the matter hainously, to have the burial of their
Archbishops discontinued, and began to make complaint unto the Pope. ^
But Christ-Church men were so far from fearing the Pope (for the same Pope
had confirmed their privileges but a little before at the suit of Bregwin)
that they chose one Lambert, or Iainbert, Abbot of Saint Augustines for their
Archbishop: assuring themselves he would be now as earnest a defender of their
liberties, as heretofore he had been an oppugner in the behalf of Saint
Augustines. But they found it otherwise, for perceiving his end to approach, he
took order to be buried in S^^nt (...), but he was the last of all the
Archbishops there in (...) Archbishop ^7. years, and lived ninety four: his
funerals were (...) pomp and celebritie, and his body honorably entombed
here in (...) Chapter House. Upon which this Epitaph was engraven.

Gemma Sacerdotum (...) remotum,
Clauditur hac fossa (...) and ^ssa.
Sub hac molecinis, (...) ^inis

I find some Epitaphs to the memory of sundry Abbots of this Monastery; and
first, Peter the first Abbot of S. Austins.
of the first Abbot, one Peter a Priest, who was chosen to this place by Saint
Augustine, as I have said before. This man was sent Legate into France, by king
Ethelbert, and in his return for England, was drowned in a Crecke, (...). 1.
ca. 33.
called Amflete; his body was taken up, and buried after a homely manner of the
inhabitants of that country; yet afterward removed from thence, and
honorably interred in the Tow^e of Bulley^e. in a place of Saint Mary's Church
convenient for so worthy a person. For whom a Monument was erected within this
Abbey, bearing this Inscription*

Lib. 5. Aug. in bi^ Cot. Gul^el Spina.

Dum semel hic transit mare ventus in vrbe remansit

He was drowned about the year, 614. My old Anonimall Manuscrip speaks of
this first Abbot to the like effect.

John ^^e second Abbot
John a monk of this house, and the third man of note which came over with
Austin, was elected Abbot of this house, and received benediction at the hands
of Archbishop Laurence. He died, Ann. 618. and was buried here in our Ladies
Chapel, and this was his Epitaph.

Omnibus est annis pietas recitanda Iohannis
Culmine celsa nimis p^tribusque simillima primis.
Vir probus and mitis fu^^ hic si fare velitis
Integer and mundus sap^ens Abbasque secundus.
Ruffinian was here interred by his predecessor John, Ruffinian the third.
who dyed, Ann. 626.

Pausa patris sani patet istec Ruffiniani

Gratiosus succeeded Ruffinian in his holy government: Gratiosus the fourth.
a man gracious, says mine Author, with God and all good men. And so ended his
worldly pilgrimage, Ann. 640.

Hic Abbas quartus Gratiosus contulit artus,
Cuius adest pausa miti spiramine clausa.
Petronius was sacred to this Ecclesiastical dignity by Archbishop Honorius,
Petronius the fifth.
Ann. 640. and died Ann. 654.

Abbas Petronius bonitatis odore refertus.
Subiectos docuit, vitiorum sorde pianit.
Nathaniel vir probitate decoratus, Nathaniel the sixth.
and absolute in all perfections, was consecrated Abbot here in his own
Church, by Archbishop Deus-dedit, which he laudably governed thirteen years,
and died, Ann. 667.

Spiritus in celis Abbatis Nathanielis,
Nos faciat memores Patres memorare v^litis.
Adrian borne in Africa; Adrian the seventh.
Abbot first of the Monastery of Niridia, near unto Naples: a man wondrous
well learned in the holy Scriptures, thoroughly instructed both in Monastical
discipline, and Ecclesiastical government; very skillful of the Greek and
Latin tongues, and withal very expert in the liberal Sciences of Astronomy,
and Music: who, together with ^heodore, Singing first used in English
Christian Churches. Bed. lib. 4. cap. 2.
brought first of all in, the tunes and notes of singing in the Church, which
for a little time was only used and known here in Kent, but afterward
learned and practiced through all the Churches of England, by the means of
reverend Bishop Wilfride, who brought from Kent James and Stephen, two
Musicians, the first Masters of song in the Churches of the kingdom of
Northumberland. But to descend to more particulars. The Archbishopricke of
Canterbury was offered to this Adrian, by Vit^ll^am the Pope (that excellent
Musician, (...) pageant of Popes.
who wrote the Ecclesiastical Canon, and first brought singing and Organs into
the Church) which he refused to undertake, preferring a Monk of his
acquaintance, namely, Theodore, (spoken of before) to the same place, in whose
company he traveled into England, and had the company and help of this
Adrian, in all things he went about to effect within England. He was
consecrated Abbot of this Monastery by the said Theodore, in the government of
which, he continued nine and thirty years. In which time he obtained many
privileges of Theodatus the Pope for his Abbey, as also of Oswin king of the
Deirians. He dyed honae memoriae senex, a reverend old man of good and perfect
remembrance, ann. 708. and was honorably entombed here in our Ladies
Chapel, with this Epitaph.

Qui legis has apices, Adriani pignora, dices
Hoc sita sarcophago sua nostro gloria pago.
Hic decus Abbatum, patrie lux, vir probitatum
Subuenit a celo si cord rogetur anhelo.
These seven Abbots (above mentioned) were all outlandish men, sent hither
either at the first to accompany Augustine, or afterward Mellitus and Iustus
in their journey from Rome.

Albinus the eighth.
Albinus the Scholar of Adrian, and Abbot of this house, was here interred,
who as he followed his Master in his office, so did he in all his good and
godly ways. And so died in the 24. year of his Abbotship, 732. and was buried
by his Master.

Laus Patris Albini non est obnoxia fini
Gloria debetur sibi quam sita vitae meretur.
Multa quippe bonos faciens virtute patronos
Abbas efficitur bonus hic et honor petitur.
Nothbald the ninth.
Shortly after the decease of Albin, one Nothbaldus a Monk of this fraternity
was chosen Abbot: in which office he continued about sixteen years, died
ann. 748. and was buried near his predecessors.

Nothbaldi mores rutilant inter Seniores,
Cuius erat vita subiectis norma polita.
Aldhume the tenth.
Aldhumus was the next Abbot, in the time of whose government the burial of
the Archbishops was taken away from the Church of this Monastery, by the
cunning slight and ouerswaying authority of Archbishop Cuthbert, as I have
partly touched: but howsoever, his holy brethren of this Covent did impute all
the fault unto the supine negligence of their Abbot, in that he did not more
carefully defend this their common cause. Whereupon after his death, which
happened, ann: 760. some 12. years, they fastened this Epitaph upon a pillar
near to the place of his burial; bewraying the viperous malice of this
Monkish brood to him their deceased father.

Fert memor Abbatis Aldhumi nil probitatis,
Pontificum Pausani cassat tutans male causam,
Prisca premens iura dum Cuthbertus tumulatur.
Fulta sepultura sanctis per eum reprobatur.
Lambert the eleventh.
About a year Lambert or Ianibert (before remembered) was Abbot of this house,
afterward Archbishop. He procured six plough lands of ground to this Abbey, of
king Edbert, in little Mongham.

Ethelnothes, Guttardus, Cunred near of kin to Nenulph the Mercian king.
Cunred and Wernod procured 40. plough lands of ground of the kings of Mercia
and Kent to their Monastery. Vt in charta
Cunredus; Wernodus, cousin to Offa and Cuthred kings of Mercia and Kent, of
whom this Wernode obtained many rich gifts for this his Monastery: Diernodus,
Wintherus, Readmundus, Kimbert, Eta, Degmund, Alfred, Ceolbert, Bectane,
Athelwold, Vlbert, Eadred, Alchmund, Sittulfe, Cadred, Luling, Beorline,
Alfricke, who by his familiarity with king Edmund, obtained two plough-land to
his Monastery. Elsnoth, Siricius who was first a Monk in Glastonbury, then
Abbot of this Monastery, from hence preferred to the Bishopric of Wiltshire,
and thence removed to this Primatship of Canterbury. A man much blamed in our
ancient Histories, for persuading with his countrymen to buy their peace with
the Danes (who had invaded Kent and ^ss^x) with the price of sixteen thousand
pounds. Wulfrike Elmer, a man of great holiness, from hence advanced to the
Bishopric of Sherborne, and after some years (falling blind) gave over that
government returned to this Abbey, wherein all the rest of his days he led a
private life. ^
Elstan first Prior of the house, whom king Knute would have preferred to the
Bishopric of W^nchester, which he denied, neither would he have taken this,
but by the importunate suit of his brethren.

These Abbots (above named) some twenty eight in number, succeeded one another,
of whom albeit we may believe that many memorable and good actions were
performed: yet time, which wears all things out of remembrance, has left
little of them remarkable to this age.

Wulfrike the second succeeded Elstan, Vir probi consilij, and often employed
upon Embasies to the Pope. He translated the body of Saint Mildred into another
place of the Church: he dyed suddenly, ann. 1059. by the just judgment of God
(says the story) because he neglected the beautifying of our Ladies Chapel,
being thereto commanded by S. Dunstan who had conference in a vision with the
blessed Virgin concerning that matter.

Upon the death of Wulfrike, ^
one Egelfine succeeded, and received benediction from Archbishop Stigand,
about the year 1063. he was sent about I know not what Embasie to Pope
Alexander the second, to whom the Pope gave this honor, That it should be
lawful for him and his successors to use the Mytre and Apostolic Sandall.
But presently upon his return home, he fled over Seas into Denmark, for fear
of William the new Conqueror. And being no sooner thus gone (without license
first obtained) his goods were confiscate to the King: and one Scotland, by
birth a Norman, invested in his place.

This Abbot received many gracious favors from the Conqueror. ^
He recovered much land unjustly taken from his Monastery, with diverse
immunities. He was a great cause for the confirmation of the ancient Franchises
and liberties of Kent; he built a great part of his Church anew, and removed
the bones of Adrian, and other Abbots, with the bodies of four Kentish kings,
being but obscurely buried, and entombed them in the Quire of the Church under
princely Monuments; he dyed the third day of September, ann. 1087. and was
buried in a vault under the Quire in S. Mary's Chapel.

Abbas Scotlandus prudentibus est memorandus

One Wido was the next Abbot, Wido the 42.
who repaired the Tomb or Shrine of Saint Augustine: he dyed August 13. ann.
1091. and was buried in a vault under S. Richards Altar. Whose tombe-stone was
thus inscribed.

Hunc statuit poni tumulum mors atra Widoni
Cui stans sede throni superi det gaudia doni.
Hugh de Flori 4^.
One Hugh de Flori, or Floriaco, a Norman borne, near a kin to the
Conqueror, under whom and his son William Rufus (being a strenuous and an
expert Soldier) he had served in the wars both of Normandy and England,
Guliel. Spina in bib. Cot.
who coming with William Rufus upon a time to visit Saint Austines Shryne,
would needs be made a Brother of this Fraternity; which being granted, he sold
forthwith all his lands in Normandy (having neither wife nor child) and took
upon him the Monastical habit: This Hugh had scarce continued one year of
probation, when as the foresaid Abbot Wido departed the world; upon whose death
the Monks of Saint Austines coming to William Rufus to obtain license to
elect a new Abbot, the king swore by Lukes face that he would have no election
at all, for he intended to take all the spiritual livings of England into his
own hands; Well, for this time they went away with each one a flea in his
ear, yet afterward it was decreed, that two circumspect grave Monks,
together with this Hugh de Flori, should be sent to the king to procure his
favor for an election, either by petition, or price; when these presented
themselves unto his sight, and that he saw his cousin, who before had served him
in the bravery of a Soldier, to be now clothed in the habit of a Monk; he
was so dismayed in mind, that gushing out with tears, he said, I do grant
you this Cousin of mine to be your Abbot, and at your petition I do give him the
government of the Abbey of Saint Augustine, neither do I permit you to choose
any other, whom, unless you do presently receive, I will shortly burn your
Abbey to ashes. Then the Monks seeing no remedy, submitted themselves to the
kings will in the premises. But the foresaid Hugh refused the dignity, saying,
That he was a man in a manner unlettered, and one that had very little skill,
as well in religion, as in Ecclesiastical ordinances; yet the king and the
Monks enforced him to accept of the honor offered, neither would the king
suffer him to depart from the Court, before he was consecrated Abbot, which was
solemnized in the kings Chapel at Westminster, by Mauricius Bishop of London.
I have been somewhat long in this narration, yet, I hope, nothing at all
troublesome, or tediously impertinent. This illustrious Abbot did many laudable
acts to the great commodity of his Church; and distributed all his goods in
works of charity. He dyed full of years as of goodness, the 26. of March,
ann. 1120. and was buried on the North side of the Chapter House built by
himself from the foundation: for whom this honorable remembrance was engraven.

Hugh the second 44.
The next Abbot in succession was one Hugh de Trottescline Chaplain to King
Henry the first, at the time of whose election, great dissension, for small
trifles, being betwixt the Monks of Christ-Church, and those of this
Monastery, William then Archbishop taking part with those angry Votaries of
his own house, denied Abbot Hugh ^enedict^on which (...) was glad to obtain
from Seffria the first, Bishop of (...). This man brought in again the old
number of his Monks, which were threescore professed, ^
beside the Abbot. He founded an Hospital near to his own Abbey, which he
dedicated to the honor of (...) and Saint (...) to the maintenance whereof he
give ^^ne Acres of ground, upon which (...) Hospital was to be erected, and
all the ^^the of the Lordship of (...) in this County, with other possessions,
(...) at the (...) 7. s. 10. d. of yearly revenue.

This Hosp^tall was ordained and appointed especially for this (...) if it
should so happen that any protest Monk of this Monastery, (...) infected with
any contagious disease, ^
but above a^^ with the (...) reason of which sickness, or infectious malady,
he could not (...) the precincts of the Abbey, without preiud^c^ and scandal
to the (...) ^^^er^^tie, that then he should be provided for in this Hospital
of a conue^n^ent ch^mber, of meat, drink, and apparel, in as full a measure
as any one of his Br^thr^n living in the Monastery.

Also, if it should so happen, that the father, the mother, the sister, or
brother, of a^y Monk of this Monastery, ^hou^d come to such great want and
^nd^gencie as that (to the reproach of any of these ^r^thren) he, or she* be
forced to ask at the gates, the alms of the Fraternity, that th^^ such of
them so asking, should be provided for in this Hospit^ll, of sufficient
^^^^stentation, according to the ability of the house, by the advice and
consideration of the Abbot of Saint Austins, and the Master of this Hospital,
for the time being, as further appears by his Charter, confirmed by many of
his Successors. This charitable Abbot dyed the year 1151. and was buried in
the Chapter house by his Predecessor.

Siluester, ^
the Prior of this Monastery, being elected Abbot upon the decease of Hugh, was
denied Benediction of Archbishop ^heobald, obi^^ting against him, that he was a
man defamed with many notorious offenses but clearing himself before the Pope
(by what m^^^es or money I know not) of all those enormous imputations laid to
his charge, upon the sight of the Popes letters, the Archbishop durst not but
give him admi^ta^^^ This Siluester instituted, that every year during the time
of Lent, so many poor people should be provided for of meat and drink
sufficient, at (...) and the charges of the Abbey, as there were Monks in the
Covent. (...) dyed ann^ 1161. and was buried by his predecessor.

One Clarembaldus (a lay man I think, ^
for he never wore other then a secular habit) by the kings regal authority,
d^d now irregularly intrude upon the possessions, goods, and government of this
Abbey, which by maine violence he extorted, and misapplyed for the space of 15.
years, until he was elected: and one Roger a Monk of Saint Trinity, and
keeper of an Altar in Christ-Church, was elected to his place.

This Roger within a short time came greatly into the kings favor, ^
who restored unto him all the lands and possessions which Clarembalde had
wickedly wrested from his Monastery. He was consecrated by Pope Alexander the
third in his own person at Tusculane, near to Rome; to whom and to his
Church, the said Pope restored the use of the Mytre, Sandalls, and crosier,
which had been neglected ever since the flight of Abbot Egelfine, (who first
obtained that honor) into Denmark. This man endured many miseries the most
part of his lifetime, (which was very long) especially in the troublesome
reign of king John. And so to conclude with the words of mine Author. Will.

Roger being dead, one Alexander a Monk of this Monastery, and a most
excellent Divine, Alexander surnamed Cementari^^ Theologus the 48.
was elected Abbot, a man both in secular and Ecclesiastical affairs well
experienced, and of king John singularly beloved, yet for all his good parts
and great friends, Archbishop Langton absolute^ly denied him Benediction: for
it was in that time when the king and the Bishop were at sore variance; so that
he was constrained to travel to Rome, where he received consecration at the
hands of Pope Innocent the third. Obijt Abbas iste Deo dilectus nocte, viz.

This Abbot was, Vir corpore elegantissimus, facie venerabilis, and literarum

summam confusionem viliter praecipitatus erat, says Mat. Westminst. ad An.
1209.

Hugh the third the 49. Abbot.
By the general consent of the whole Covent, one Hugh, Chamberlain of this
house, was elected, sworn, and blessed by the Popes Legate at Winchester,
before the king and many of the Peers of the kingdom. This Abbot was
religious, honest, provident, and with learning, and a godly life life greatly
adorned; and so departed from all worldly employment, the third day of
November, 1224. and was buried by the Altar of the holy Cross under a flat
marble stone, thus engraven.

Prosuit in populo Domini venerabilis Hugo,
Et tribuit sancte subiectis dogmata vite.
Robert de Bell^ the 50.
A provident and discreet Brother of this house succeeded Hugh in the
Abbotship, to whom in like manner as he did to Alexander, the Archbishop
utterly denied benediction, and admittance; for which he was enforced to
travel to Rome, and there was sacred by the hands of Patrick Bishop of
Albania, and Cardinal, by the Popes commandment. This Abbots name was Robert
de Bello, and belle rexit, for the space of eleven years. Et obijt crastino

Roger the second 51.
Roger of Cicester by way of comprimise succeeded Robert, for whose admittance,
or holy blessing, Pope Innocent the fourth writ his powerful letters to
Boni^^^^* then Archbishop of Canter^ur^; ^
but what (...) took I do not find. He founded the Church or Chapel of

The next that enjoyed this dignity was, ^
Nicholas de Spina, he was con^secrated at Rome by the Bishop of Portua, by the
commandment of Pope Nicholas the third, of whom he was approved to be, Virum
prudentem, (...) us et doctrina multipliciter decoratum, in temporalibus et
spiritualibus (...) Who when he had with great wisdom governed his (...) the
s^a^e of ten years, he took his journey, by the kings permission to the
Pope, before whom he resigned his Abbotship to one Thomas Fi^^on.

before: (...) had strenu^usl^ governed his Church the space of 26. years,

buried in a little Chapel (wherein usually every day a Mass was (...) for
the whole Estate of the Church militant upon earth) under a marble stone inla^d
with brass after the manner of a Bishop. With this Epit^ph.

After the death of Findon, one of this Fraternity, called Raph de Borne, Raph
de Borne the 54.
was elected. Who presently upon his election, took his journey to Avi(...)
the Popes Court, where he was confirmed and consecrated by the Bishop of
Ho^tia. Having laudablie governed this house 25. years, he dyed a venerable
old man, ann. 1334. and was here honorably entombed in the North-wall.

Pervigil in populo morum probitate decorus

book of Canterbury) to have been Abbatem Religionis feruidum, Mssan bib. Cot.
Zelatorum morum, et etatis grauitate decorum, scientia preditum, in

Thomas Poucyn the 55.
In the same year, the first of March, Thomas Poucyn, Doctor of Divinity, was
chosen Abbot of this Monastery; he took his journey for benediction, to the
Popes Court, which then lay at Auinion in France, the nine and twentieth of the
same month of March, whither he came upon Saint George his Eve following: he
had his admittance and blessing at the hands of Pope John the two and
twentieth, the day after the feast of Saint Barnabie; he stayed at Auinion
until the feast of S. Lawrence, from whence taking his journey for England, he
landed at Dover upon S. Gregory's day. Now if any man of his coat, dignity,
and revenue, be desirous to know the expenses of a journey to Auinion, here he
may have it, taken out of the red book of Canterbury, In bib. Cot.
to a single halfe-pennie.

His expenses from Dover to Auinion, which he performed in three weeks and
three days, came to the sum of 21. l. 18. s. 2. d. his expenses staying
there, from S. George his Eve, until the Eve of S. Lawrence, 18. l. 4. s. 5.
d. ob. and in his voyage back to this Monastery, his expenses came to 28 l.
8. d. About some nine years after this travel, he made an end of all his
travels by death, on the day of the translation of Saint Augustine, ann. 1343.
being all his time a careful Shepherd over the flock committed to his charge:
he was entombed by his predecessor.

Est Abbas Thomas tumulo present reclusus,

William Drulege the ^6.
The next that succeeded Poucyn, was one William Drulege, a man of stature, like
little Zacheus, but of a mind immense and vigorous; or like Homers noble
little Captain Tydeus, corpore paruus ingenio pugnax. Mayor in exiguo regnabat
corpore virtus.
For to enlarge the revenues of his Church, he was ever wondrous solicitous,
and in defense of her liberties stout and magnanimous: persisting still as
devout and watchful in his Ecclesiastical contemplations, as he was wise
and circumspect in his temporal employments. Non quarendus quantus sit quisque
sea qualis, neque quam procerus sed quam probus: A little man is as much a man
as the greatest man of the Guard. But I may be thought quickly to speak
somewhat partially, being none of these high puissant pikemen: enough then of
little men, if not a little too much. So to return to this diminutiue Abbot
Drulege, who by the consent of the Covent, ordained the feasts of Ianibert,
Nothelm, Brithwold, and Tatwin, Archbishops, to be celebrated twice in the
year; But to conclude, when for the short time he sat, he had much advanced
his Monastery, he dyed on the Vigils of Saint Mauritius, which is the 11. of
September, 1349. and was buried in the Chapter house, with this Epitaph upon
his Monument.

En paruus Abbas hic parua clauditur arca,
In gestis magnus, mayor nec erat Patriarcha.
Willelmus Druleg illustri dignus honor,
Conuentum claustri qui multo rexit amore.
Pro dilectoris anima tui dulciter ora
Sancti Augustini conuentus, qualibet hora.
I find little, or indeed nothing at all, of such Abbots as succeeded little
Drulege, saving their names thus recorded.

John Deueniche the 57. Thomas Colwell 58. Michaell Peckham 59. William W^ld
60. Thomas Hunden 61. Marcellus Dandlyon 62. John Hawlherst 63. George
Pensherst 64. Jacob Seuenoke 65. William Selling 66. John Dunster 67. John
Dygon 68. Thomas Hampton 69. and John Essex 70. So that by this account there
has been more Archbishops of Christ-Church, M^re Archbishop, then Abbots by
three.
then Abbots of Saint Austins by the number of three, reckoning those six
Bishops which have been since the dissolution: The Abbot of this house was
ever a Baron of the Parliament.

In S. Anns Chapel within the Church of this Monastery, Julian Coun^e^^e of
H^ntington.
lay sometime buried the body of Julian the daughter and heir of Sir Thomas
L^yborne, knight. The widow, says Vincent, of John Lord Hastings of
Aburgaueny, and mother of Lawrence Hasting, Catal. in Hunting.
Earl of Pembroke* and after that, wife of William de Clinton, Earl of
Huntington, and Lord high Admiral of England, who dyed about the year 1350.

But of all these and thousands more here interred (whose names I cannot
learn) not one bone at this time lies near another, nor one stone almost of
the whole fabric stands upon another: therefore I will take my leave of this
Abbey with these words of a late writer: Io. Spend. (...).
This Monastery (says he) as all the rest did, came to her fatal period in
the days of king Henry the eight, whose uncovered walls stood so long
languishing in time, and storms of weather, that daily increased the aspect of
her ruins, till now lastly, they are made subject to other public uses, and
the whole tract of that most goodly foundation in the same place no where
appearing. Only Ethelberts Tower in memory and honor of the man, as yet has
escaped the verdict and sentence of destruction; whose beauty, though much de
faced and ouerworne, will witness to succeeding ages the magnificence of the
whole, when all stood complete in their glory together. The revenues yearly
of this house were in the Exchequer, 1412. l. 4. s. 7. d. ob. q. it was
surrendered 4. December. 29. H. 8.

At Harbaldowne, P^iory of Ha^^baldowne.
not far from this Monastery, Archbishop Lan^rank built an Hosp^tall, and
dedicated the same to the honor of Saint John, to the which he annexed a
Priorie of black Canons, valued both together at the dissolution to 266. l. 4
s. 5. d. ob. of yearly revenue: it was ordained for the lame, and diseased;
which as yet is not altogether suppressed, although much abated (as I hear) of
her annual possessions. In which house was reserved the upper leather of an
old shoe, Lamb. peram in Harbaldowne.
which had been worn (as they gave it out) by Saint Thomas Becket: this shoe,
as a sacred Relic, was offered to all passengers to kiss; fair set in
copper, and crystal.

Leicester, and Lord high Steward of England; a most honorable Lady, Ca^den in
Kent.
who having abandoned all worldly pleasures, sequestered her self wholly from
the world, to serve God devoutly in this place: who dyed about the year 1219.
The manor and Town of Elham was her inheritance.

whom hereafter according to my method. Sir Roger Manwoods Almes-house.
But I must not let pass seven alms houses here built by the said Sir Roger
Manwood, chief Baron of the Exchequer, ann. 1573. for aged honest poor
folks, which he endowed with a yearly allowance of four pounds, in money,
bread, and fuel, for every one of those almes-men.

It was called S. Stephens, f^r that the image of Saint Stephen (standing where
the garden now is, A pilgrimage^ (...) S. Stephens (...).
belonging to Sir Manwoods great house) was sought unto by many pilgrims.

Reculuer.
At the upper end of the South isle in this Church, I saw a Monument of an
antique form, mounted with two spires. Wherein (as the Inhabitants have it by
tradition) the body of one Ethelbert, Ethelbert the second king of ^^nt.
a Saxon king, who had his palace royal here in Reculuer, lies entombed, and
the Anuals of Canterbury affirm as much: And true it is that Ethelbert the
first, and first Christian king, built here a Princely mansion for himself and
his successors; wherein diverse of the Kentish kings sometimes kept their
courtly residence. But whether he be this Ethelbert the second, or Ethelbert
surnamed Pren, that lies here interred, it is not much material, for they
both dyed without any memorable act, either of themselves, or their kingdoms
affairs: The end of the Kentish kingdom.
and so dyed Cuthred and Baldred their next successors, and the last kings of
Kent. Which kingdom erected by Hengist, the year of man's happiness 455.
continued her government 372. and ended her glory in the year 827. being made
a Province to the West Saxons.

The found (...) the Abbey at Reculuer.
Egbert, or Egbright (the seventh king of Kent in succession, after Hengist)
gave to one Bassa an English Saxon, some land here in Reculuer, whereupon he
built him a Minster, or a Monastery, whereof Brightwald afterward Archbishop
of Canterbury, was the first Abbot: so that of this man and the Minster the
poor Towns men may make great vaunts. ^

Minster in the Isle of Tenet.
Here in this Church lies a Lady entombed in a Monument vpreared after a
strange fashion, ^dila Lady Thorn.
inscribed with a Saxon-like character.

Ici gist Edile de Shornerepust Dame del espire.
I think her name was rather Thorn, then Shorn, one letter being mistaken
for another in the engrauing. My reason is this, for that in this Parish there
is a place called Thorn.

Near unto this Monument lie three flat Tombe-stones, under which (as I
conjecture) by the effigies upon them) three veiled Nuns of the Saxon
Nobility, Thr^e veiled Nuns
and of S. Mildreds Monastery lie interred, but the Inscriptions are gone.

Which Monastery was founded upon this occasion: Egbert king of Kent aspiring
to the Crown, The foundation of Minster Abbey.
by the traitorous murder of his two young Nephews, Ethelred and Ethelbert, to
pacify Domneua, sister to the said murdered Princes, and immediate heir to
the kingdom, promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would demand.
This devout Lady begged so much ground to build a religious house upon, Io.
Ca^graue in v. ^a Dom.
as a tame De^re which she kept, would run over at a breath: one Thunnor, or
Thymur (one of his council, and his assistant in the foresaid murder) standing
by, blamed him of inconsideration, for that he would upon the uncertain
course of a Dear, depart to his certain loss, with any part of so good a
Soil. Which words he had no sooner spoken (says the book of Saint Augustine)
but that the earth immediately opened and swallowed him up. Well, the King and
the Lady proceeded in their bargain, and the Hynde ran over forty and eight
Plough^lands, before she returned. This do nation the king confirmed by his
Charters, Mss^a bib. Cot
which I have read in the book of S. Austins, to the infringers whereof he
added this fearful curse.

Si cui vero hec largicio displicet, vel si quis (quod absit) hanc donationem

seventy veyled Nuns: She departed out of this world about the year of our

^. Mildred.
Mildred the daughter of Dom^^^a, and M^rwald, a Prince of West-Mercia,
succeeded in her mothers pl^^^* ^n which she continued a long time: dyed in
the reign of King (...), was interred by her mother, and afterward canonized
a Saint (...) the Mercian king, confirmed by his charter to this Mildred and
her Covent, the custom of the ships which arrived in the public Port of
London, as appears by his charter.

Ca^utus king of England, gave by his Charter the body of this Mildred, with
the lands belonging to this Priory, to the Abbey of S. Austins, in these words.

Notum sit omnibus, etc. me dedisse Augustino, and fratribus eiusdem
Monasterij, corpus beat Mildrede gloriose Virginis; cum t^ta terra sua infra
in sulam ac I^anet, and extra, cum omnibus cons^etudinibus suis.

(...) on of Mildred.
The year 10*0 her body was translated by Abbot Elstan, as I have said before,
and after that by his Successor Wulfrike, to another place of the Church. Her
relics were laid in a leaden coffin, whereupon this Epitaph was insculped.
Clauditur hoc saxo Mildreda sacerrima virgo.
Cuius nos procibus adiuuet ipse Deus.
The bodies of the most esteemed godly in former ages, took the least rest in
their graves, for they were still removed, and their bodies clattered together
from one place to another; as it does, and will appear, both by the premises
and sequel of this my Treatise. You have read before how often the body of
Saint Augustine was tossed from porch to pillar, and besides his Relics were
divided, and subdivided into certain vessels. For the day after the solemnity
of Prior Marisco (before remembered) upon the finding out of his Stone-coffin,
there was found, unlooked for, a Lead of seven foot long, having this
Inscription.

^
Hic habetur pars ossium and cineris beati Augustini Anglorum Apostoli, qui
olim missus a beato Gregorio, gentem Anglicam ad fidem Christi conuertit, cuius
preciosum capud, and ossa maiora, Guido Abbas honorifice transtulit, sicut
tabula plumbea cum eisdem ossibus posita indicat.

But Henry the eight made an end of all this unnecessary trouble, and charges,
by removing once for all, as well Relics, as Religious houses. Now to return.

^.
Ethelinga the third Prioresse of this house, seeing the Church builded by her
predecessor Domneua, not capable to contain so many holy Virgins; built
another Temple far more sumptuous then the first, which was consecrated by
Archbishop Cuthbert to the honor of S. Peter and Paul. She dyed ann. 751. and
was buried in her own new Church.

^
Sexburga (says the book of Saint Augustine) the daughter of Anna, king of
the East Angles, the wife of Ercombert, the mother of Egbert, and ^othaire, all
kings of Kent; after the death of her husband took upon her the habit of a
Nun, and was admitted and consecrated Prioresse of this place, by Archbishop
Cuthbert. In her time those furious Beare-whelps, Hungar and Hubba ( Nam vt

with a fierce army first invaded this kingdom. She dyed about the year 797.
and was buried in this new Church. Capgraue says at Ely.

Seberitha was the first Votarie admitted, and consecrated Lady Prioresse of
this house, by Ethelard Archbishop of Canterbury, who was no sooner well settled
in her government, then that the Danes came back again, and in their savage
fury overwhelmed the Island of Tenet, destroyed, and utterly demolished this
Monastery; and her, with her holy Sisters, enclosed in secret caves for fear
of the enemy; they found out, and burned them all to ashes.

Capgraue, Eadburgh (...) first English Nun, surnamed (...).
a Kentish man borne, reports that Eadburgh the daughter of good king
Ethelbert, by his virtuous Queen Berta, was brought up a Nun in this
Monastery, under the foundresse Domneua, that she succeeded Mildred in the
Monastical government; that she was buried here in this Church, and that long
after, her relics (the chief and most frequent way in those times to enrich
any new built Church) were removed by Lanfrank, Archbishop of Canterbury, to
the Church of Harbaldowne of his own foundation, Camden in K.
and there had in great veneration. But Camden, to whom I must needs give more
credit, speaking of S. Eadburghs Well at Liming in this Tract, will have her to
be the first veiled Nun in all England. And that she lived here in a
Monastery of her own building, that here she dyed, Speed. Hist.
and here at Lyming was buried, says Speed, that she was surnamed, Tace, a fit
name for a woman, and that she had been the wife of Edwin king of
Northumberland.

Sandwich:
Before the general suppression here, was a religious house of white Friars
Carmelites, The foundation of the white Friars, and of the old Hospital.
founded by one Henry Cowfeld an Almaine, Ann. 1272. and an Hospital founded
by Thomas Rabyng, William Swanne, Clerks, John Goddard and Richard Long.

In a book of this order of Carmes, written by John Bale, of which I have
spoken in the prefixed discourse, A Manuscript.
I find the Foundation of this Religious structure, as also certain Epitaphs
made to the memory of diverse of the Fraternity therein interred; in this
manner following.

The foundation ^f the free School.
Ann. 1563. Sir Roger Manwood before remembered, native of this place, founded
here a free School, which he endowed with forty pounds of yearly revenue.

Richborow.
Right famous in former times (says Camden) was the City of Richborow, whereof
now nothing remains, save certain walls of a Castie of rough flint and
Britane brickes, in form of a Quadrant. Over the entry whereof is the head of
Queen Berta (as some say) graven in stone, the wife of King Ethelbert, who
here had a royal palace. The Romans had their Presidents or Prouosts who had
the government of this City, of which I find but only two to have been here
interred, namely, Flauius Sanctius, and Claudius Contentus, the one ruling with
all peace, the other living in all riches and prosperity: whose memories are
thus preserved by the Poet Ausonius: Militiam nullo qui turbine sedulus egit,
Praeside letatus quae Rhutupinus ager.
His martial service he discharged with care, without all strife:
And Rutupin reioyc'd in him, whilst there he was in life.
The same Author sets forth likewise in a lamentable funeral verse, in the
praise of Claudius Contentus, whom he calls Uncle, who being overtaken with
death, left behind him unto strangers, a mighty great stock of money, which
he had put out to usury among the Britains, and increased by interest.

Et patruos Elegia meos reminiscere cantus
Contentum tellus quem Rhutupina tegit. Claudius Contentus.

My doleful Muse now call to mind the songs of Uncle mine,
Contentus, who enterred lies within mould Rutupine. Ca^nd. Ken^.

The name of Kiriell has been of great note and antiquity within this County:
Stow. Annal.
Sir Nicholas Kiriell flourished in the reign of King Richard the second, and
Sir Thomas Kiriell beheaded with the Lord Bouvile the day after the second
battle at Saint Albons, in the reign of King Henry the sixth: or slain in
the battle according to John Harding.

In this Church are some ancient Monuments (but now without Inscriptions)
erected to the memory of the Philipots, or Philpots, a family which has
resided here a long time at Vpton Court, within this Parish; of which name and
family was that renowned Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Philpot. knight, Lord
Mayor of London.

Stow. Annal.


Sir John Philpot, knighted in the field by King Richard the second, together
with Sir William Wallworth, then Mayor, and other Aldermen, for the good
service they performed against Watt Tylar and his accomplices, Rebels of Kent and
Essex. This Sir John gave to the City certain lands for the finding of
thirteen poor people for ever. Stow. Suruay.
It is likewise remembered of him, to his eternal honor, that Ann. 2. R. 2. he
manned forth a Fleet, at his own charges, to scour the narrow Seas of such
Scottish, French, and Spanish Pirates, as had done much villainy by their often
incursions, to many of our English Ports* and Harbors; with which he not only
guarded both water and Land from their intolerable violences, but also took
their prime Captain, Speed. Hist. 22. Ric. 1*
one John Mercer a Scot, with all his whole Navy, consisting of fifteen
Spanish ships, all being fraught with very rich commodities. Which memorable
atchieuement, as it was right worthily applauded, The Walsingham in vita Ric. 1.
extolled, and admired of all the faithful Commonaltie; so was it most
wrongfully undervalued, envied, and drawn into question by some of the
slothful Nobility.

Ikham.
Sir Thomas Ba knight.
In this Church I saw an old Monument, upon which only these words are
remaining: Hic..... Ba miles. And in the window under his arms in an old
character written, Thomas de Ba. Of which short surname I find nothing related
in writing, nor delivered by word of mouth, either short or long.

Chiselherst.
Here is the burial place of the Walsinghams.

Monkton in the Isle of Tenet. At the West end of this Church are these verses
to be read:
Insula rotunda Thanatos quam circuit vnda.
Fertilis and munda, nulli est in orb secunda.
The Isle of Thanet which is round, and watered round about,
Does pass the Isles in fruitfulness, that be the world throughout.

Lamb peramb.


Here sometime stood a Collegiate Church founded by John Peckham, Archbishop of
Canterbury, about the year 1287. wherein he placed Canons regular, valued at
the time of suppression, at fourscore and four pounds of yearly revenues.

Knowlton.
In this Church are buried some of Ringleis, ^
one of them kneeling in complete armor, his arms fixed on the Monument. It
seems the Langleys who lived here a long time, did either found or reedifie
this Church: their arms being fixed over the door upon the fount, and in the
windows.

Dover.
In the Church within the Castle, Sir Robert Ashton knight, Lord Warden
lies a knight, whose pourtraiture is inlaid with brass upon a marble stone,
with this Inscription.

He was also one of the Executours to the last Will and Testament of king Edward

He was descended from the Asshetons, of Assheton vnderline, in the County of
Lancaster, as I find it in the pedigree of Sir Ralph Assheton of Whalley,
Baronet; descended from the same family.

He gave the great Bell of the Church within Dover Dastle, as appears by this
Inscription, cast in the metal, about the circumference of the same.

Foundation of the Castle Church.

Lamb. peramb.


Lucius, the first christened king of the Britains, built this Church, to the
name and service of Christ, endowing it with the Toll or custom of Dover.

The Priory of S. Martins, or Gods-house in Dover.
Eadbald, the son of Ethelbert, king of Kent, to expiate his foul sins of
incest, and infidelity, amongst other his pious actions, erected a College
within the walls of this Castle, which Wightred (a successor of his) removed
into the Town: stored it with two and twenty Chanons, and dedicated it to the
name of Saint Martine, Regist. eccl. (...) in bib. Cot.
Ann. 725. Which house was afterward new builded by king Henry the first, or
rather by William Corbeil Archbishop, as I conjecture by these words: Nouum
opus Sancti Martini incipitur a Wilhelmo Corbuil, Ann. 1132. wherein Theobald
the successor of Corbeil placed Benedictine Monks, and called it the new Work
at Dover, and was surrendered 16. Nouemb. 27. Hen. 8. the value of this
foundation was yearly 232. l. 10. s. 5. d. ob. and was surrendered, 26. Nouemb.

Folkston.
^^mmati^n of the (...) at ^ol^^ton.
A Town famous in times past, and much frequented by the English Saxons for
religion sake, by reason of a Monastery, which Eauswide the daughter of
Eadbald, king of Kent, erected for religious women; of which, she became the
first Prioresse. She dedicated her Church to the honor of Saint Peter, and
replenished her house with black Nuns: she continued herein Abbess a long
time, ^.
and so dyed a veiled Virgin, about the year 673. This foundation was long ago
swallowed up with the sea; and another built by John Segraue, ^.
and Julian his wife, the daughter and heir of John Sandwich, who was Lord of
this Town, together with John Clinton, in the reign of king Henry the third,
who consecrated this their holy fabric to the honor of Saint Peter, and S.
Eauswid. Whose relics they translated, into their new built Church; there
they were gloriously en^^^rined, and she honored for a Saint. Of whom the
credulous common people did report many strange wonders: As that she
lengthened a bean^^ of this her religious building three foot, when the
Carpenters (missing their measure) had made it so much too short: That she
haled and drew water over the hills against nature: ^
That she forbad certain ravenous birds the country, which before did much
hurt thereabouts: That she restored the blind, cast out the devil, and healed
innumerable folks of their infirmities. And therefore after her death, she was
by the policy of the Church of Rome, and the Popish Priests, canonized; and by
the folly of the common people (says Lambard) honored for a Saint. ^


And no marvel at all (says he) for it was usual amongst the Clergiemen in
those days, not only to magnify their Benefactours of all sorts; but to
deifie also so many of them (at the least) as were of noble parentage, knowing
that thereby triple commodity ensued; the first, for as much as by that means
they assured many great Personages unto them: secondly, they drew (by the awe
of their example) infinite numbers of the common people after them: and lastly,
they adventured the more boldly (under those honorable and glorious names and
titles) to publish their fained miracles. And this surely was the cause that
Sexburga in Shepie, Mildred in Tanet, Etheldred at Elye, Edith at Wilton, and
sundry other such women of royal blood in each quarter, were canonized
Saints: for generally the Religious of those times were as thankful to their
Benefactours, as ever were the heathen nations to their first Kings and
Founders. The one for sanctifying such as did either build them houses, or
devise them Orders; and the other deifying such, as had made them Cities, or
prescribed them laws and government.

This was it that made Saturn, Hercules, Romulus, and others more, to have
place (in common opinion) with the Gods above the stars: and this caused
Dunstan, Edgar, Ethelwold, and others, first to be shrined here in earth, and
then to sit amongst the Saints in heaven. This Nunnery was valued at the fatal
overthrow of all such edifices, at 63. l. 7. s. per annum. It was surrendered
15. Nouemb. 27. H. 8.

they report to have been cast upon this Shore by shipwreck, and from hence
called into the glorious company of Saints. Look Iacobus de voragine, in the
Legend of their lives, and you may believe (perhaps) as much as is here spoken:
they were Shoomakers, and suffered martyrdom the tenth of the Kalends of

at Tyborne. The place fatal to both was Pontefract: ^^den in Rut.

The Priory near Rumney.
^
The Priory of Regular Canons near Rumney, was founded by John Mansell, Provost
of Beuerley, in the year that God took upon him the form of a Servant, 1257.
the 41. of king Henry the third: of the which foundation, ^
as also of the Founder, read if you please these words out of Matthew Paris.
In the same year, says he, Sir John Mansell Provost of Beuerley, the Kings
Chaplain, and of his especial Council, a man prudent, circumspect, and rich,
wisely considering, that the favor of a king is not hereditarie, nor the
prosperity of the world always permanent: founded a Religious house of
Regular Canons, near by Rumney, two miles from the sea, and endowed it with
very ample revenues, which he replenished with Canons, by the example of Peter
Chareport: who, as he was informed, not many days before, had piously and
prosperously founded an house of the same order, that so passing by temporal
goods, they might not loose eternal.

Bilsington.
A Priory likewise built by the said John Maunsell, The P^io^y of (...).
for King Henry the third, and Eleanor his wife, and dedicated to the blessed
Virgin Mary, wherein he placed black Canons; which was valued amongst the
rest of the suppressed houses, at 8. l. 1. s. 6. d. of yearly commings in.
This house was surrendered 19. Ianuar. 36. H^n. 8.

But to proceed a little further with this John Maunsell, John Ma^s^^^
p^efe^men^s.
his Ecclesiastical and Temporal dignities; who besides being Provost of
Beuerley, was Treasurer of York, Parson of Maidstone, in this County, and
Parson of Wigan in Lanchishire, to whom king Henry the third did grant that his
Town of Wigan should be a Burrow. He was chief Justice of England, one of
the privy Council to the said King, ^
his Chaplain, his Ambassador into Spain, a worthy Soldier, In armis
strenuus, and animo imperterritus. who with his own hands, in a battle
betwixt the English and the French, near to Tailborge in France, Hollins. An
1241.
took Prisoner one Peter Orige, a gentleman of eminent place and quality: He
was crossed to go to Jerusalem. He feasted at his house in Tole-hill field, at
one time, two kings, two Queens, with their dependances, 700. mess of meat
scarce serving for the first dinner. About the 31. year of King Henry the
third, at the instance of the said king, he was first made keeper of the great
Seal, as Vicechancellour. For, says Paris, Paris ^hinne.
Custodiam Sigilli regij accepit Cancellarij vices acturus et officium: and
afterward Lord keeper in plenarie office and authority; yet for all this
glorious pomp, and great promotions, I find his end to be poor, wretched,
and miserable, beyond Seas; but I find no place of his death nor burial:

The ruins of a Collegiate Church are here yet still to be seen; first built
by John Kempe Archbishop of Canterbury, borne in this Town; the son of
Thomas Kempe, and Beatrice his wife, who were fairly entombed in this their

The Kempe and Beatrice his wife.

In this College he placed secular Priests, to attend divine Service, and to
instruct the youth of the Parish, in Grammar, and other learning, according to
his foundation, the governor of the College was called a Prebendary. It was
begun and finished in the reign of King Henry the sixth. The value of it at

(an honor to the dead now most shamefully neglected) attended with Heralds of
Arms. But that which presents the greatest glory and antiquity to this
Church, is the Monument of the Countess of Atholl in Scotland: whose Epitaph
in old French, as also the Banners in her hands, show her to be the daughter of
the Lord Ferrers.

This king died at Dover, The death and burial of King Stephen.
of an Iliack passion, mixed with his old disease, the Emrods, October. 25. 1154.
having reigned 18. years, ten months, and odd days: and was buried in this
Church of his own foundation. Of which hear these ancient rimes.

Aftur king Harry even, Addition to Rob. Gloc. (...).

The Erlys son Bloys he was truly:
He wedded Mold the doghter of Mary.
A good man he was bedeme,
I trow king Harry was his Eme;
He regnyd here XUIII year
And to Feuersham in Kent men him bear
He deyed without issue truly,
Then regnyd his cousin Harry.
Stephen was a most worthy Soldier (says one) and wanted nothing to have made
him an excellent king, Paris An. 1154
but a just title, but that was wanting.

The which he found, Harding c. 12^.
whiles he was living so,
And reigned here, in much trouble and woe.
And had this Realm without any right,
Fro th'emprise Maude that fair Lady bright.
And this was the cause that he was driven (perforce) to defend his vsur^ped
authority by the sword, which must needs procure him the hatred of many, who
thus speak of him in old English: King Stephen his luthenesse withdrew yers a
few, Rob. Glocest.

But er Uyer were goo he ganne to wex a shrewe.
For he wend about and robbyd the land, and to grownd brought,
Then the town of Wyrcester he brent all to noght.


S. Daniel.
But to conclude with the words of a late writer. This Stephen was a man so
continually in motion (says he) that we cannot take his dimension, but only
in passing, and that but on one side which was war: on the other, we never
saw but a glaunce on him, which yet for the most part, was such as showed him
to be a very worthy Prince for the government. He kept his word with the
State, No subsidies in K Stephens time
concerning the relieuement of Tributes, and never had Subsidy that we find.

But which is more remarkable, having his sword continually out, and so many
defections, and rebellions against him, he never put any great man to death.
Besides it is noted, that notwithstanding all these miseries of war, there were
more Abbeyes built in his reign, then in an 100. years before: which shows
though the times were bad, they were not impious; the king himself being mente
piissimus, (...) ^omp. (...) in bib. Cot. Sp^^d.
as he was miles egregius.

His body rested here in quietness until the dissolution, when for the gain
of the lead wherein it was encoffined, it was taken up and thrown into the
next water. So uncertain is man, yea greatest Princes, of any rest in this
world, even after burial.

Maud the wife of K Stephen
Here sometime likewise lay interred Maud his wife, the daughter of Eustace,
Earl of Bulloigne, the brother of Godfrey, and Baldwin of Bulloigne, kings of
Jerusalem, by her mother Mary, sister to Maud, Queen of England, wife of Henry
her predecessor, who dyed at Heueningham Castle in Essex, the third of May,
1151. Whose Epitaph I found in a namelesse Manuscript.

Eustace King Stephens son.
Eustace the son and heir apparent of Stephen, and Queen Maud, lived not
long after his mother, for being highly displeased with the agreement betwixt
his father, and Henry Fitzempresse, afterward king of England, by which he was
made hopeless ever to have the Crown as his fathers Successor: in a fury he
departed the Court, purposing to raise himself by his own means; and so
marched along, destroying the country always as he went, (...). Monk^ of
Chester.
until he came to Saint Edmundsbury; where he was honorably received of the
Monks of that Monastery. But he came not for meat but money: and thereupon
(ungratefully) urged them for a great sum to set forward his heady designs;
yet the wiser amongst them, unwilling to be wagers of new wars (which though
ill for all sorts, yet proved ever worst for the Clargie men's possessions)
denied his request. Wherewith e^raged be commanded his own men to carry their

His body was brought to this Abbey, and here interred by his mother. His death
happened the tenth day of August, 1152. He was married to Constance sister of
Lewis, the seventh king of France, daughter of king Lewis the Gross, by whom
he had no issue. In this Abbey (says Robert of Gloucester) is a piece of ye hely
croys which Godfrey Boylon forkyndred had sent to king Stephene. Rob. Gloc.

one of which house, called William Crowmer Esquire, son of Sir William, Lord
Mayor of London, high Shiriffe of Kent, in the fury of Jack Cade, and the
Kentish and Essex rebels, was sacrificed at Mile-end, and cut shorter by the
head; like as the day before they had served Sir James Fienes, Sir James Fienes
I.o. Treasurer
Lord Say, and Sele, and Treasurer of England in Cheape-side, whose only
daughter this Crowmer had married. Whose heads (give me leave to go a little
further) pitched upon high poles, were carried by the villains through the
City of London, who caused their trunklesse faces (in spite and mockery) to
kiss one the other at every street-corner, as they marched along in this their
damnable triumph, and hellish ouation. Which horrid act was committed the third
of July, 1450.

Monuments, which have been removed (as I conceive) out of the Chapel

is thus inscribed:

Hic iacent Rogerus Norwood, Roger Norwood, and Bena his wife.
et Boon vxor eius sepulti ante Conquestum.

The Norwoods are a worthy ancient family I confess; and may very well, for
any thing that I know, have flourished before the Conquest, but I am sure that
the character of this Inscription is but of later times, making but little show
of any great Antiquity.

In the most holy name of Jesus prey for ye sowl of John Soole, Io. Soole and

Here I saw some antique Monuments of the Shurland^, Shurland:
sometimes Lords of the Manor of Shurland, hereunto adjoining: of whom the
inhabitants have many strange relations not worth remembering. Sir Robert
Shurland flourished in the reign of king Edward the first.

This Sir Thomas Cheyne was also Constable of Queene-borough Castle, a strong
fortress in this Isle, pleasant for sight, built by King Edward the third; to
the terror of his enemies, and solace of his people; unto which he adjoined a
Burgh, and in the honor of Philip the Queen his wife, called it
Queene-borough, as one would say, the Queens Burgh. This has been an office
ever thought worthy of many great personages; as appears by their Catalogue,
which I copied out of the Collections of Glouer, alias Somerset.

Baron Herbert of Shurland, and Earl of Mountgomery, upon one and the same day,
viz. the fourth day of May, 1605. And whom King Charles, our dread Sovereign,
has made Lord Chamberlain of his Household. And to whom at this day, by the
death of his thrice noble Brother, William, Earl of Penbroke, are added the
honors and titles of Earl of Penbroke, Baron Herbert of Caerdiffe in Wales,
Lord Parre and Roos of Kendall, Marmion, and S. Quintin.

Here in this Parish was anciently the mansion house of the family De Sancto

Boniface of Sauoy, Maidston.
Archbishop of Canterbury, Uncle to Eleanor the wife of king Henry the third,
built (here at the confluence of the waters) a religious structure, Found. of
the College first an Hospital.
to the honor of Saint Peter, S. Paul, and S Thomas the Martyr, (as most call
him) and endowed it with fair possessions, by the name of an Hospital, but
usually called, The new Work, which had not stood fully an hundred and forty
years, but that William Courtney, one of his Successors in this See, pulled
it down, and erected it anew, after his own pleasure; thereby gaining the
name of a Founder; and called it a College of secular Priests, which he
consecrated to the holiness of All Saints, which was valued at the
suppression, at 139. l. 7. s. 6. d. of yearly revenues.

This Archbishop Courtney was son of Hugh Courtney, the third of that
Christian name, Earl of Devonshire, by Margaret his wife, daughter of Humphrey
de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, and Essex. And being thus honorably descended,
he was no sooner entered into Orders, but that he was laden with spiritual
preferments; as a Prebend in Wells, Exceter, and Canterbury, beside Benefices
with Cure, more, I think, then he could well discharge. The first Bishopric
he had, was Hereford, which he enjoyed five years, from thence he was removed
to London, which he governed about six years (in which time, says
Walsingham, he was advanced to the dignity of Cardinal) from London to
Canterbury; which gracious honor, he enjoyed 12. years lacking one month,
even until his death: which happened the last day of July, 1396. He lies
buried according to his will here in his own Church, under a plain
graue-stone (a lowly Tomb for such an high borne Prelate) upon which his
pourtraiture is delineated, and this Epitaph inlaid with brass about the Verge.

This Archbishop bestowed much in building and enlarging of his houses,
especially upon his Castle of Saltwood. Toward the reparation of his Church at
Canterbury, he gave 1000. Marks; he gave also unto the same Church, a certain
image of silver, weighing one hundred and threescore pounds, two vestments, and
thirteen Copes of great value. Besides a number of books.

Chancery of Maidston
I find, says M. Lambard, in a Record that Thomas Arundell, Archbishop of
Canterbury, the next Successor of Courtney, founded a Chantrie at Maidston,
which whether it be the same, that was sometime called the house of the
Brothers, and but lately converted by the Townsmen into a freeschoole, or no, I
will not boldly affirmed* but I think it rather so then otherwise.

Leedes.
There was a Priory in this Town built, and amply endowed by one Sir Robert
Creuequer, Leedes Priory.
and Adam his son and heir, who in ancient Records is named, de Creuequer,
or de crepito cord (a Nobleman of Normandy, and knight to William the
Conqueror) in the year of our redemption 1107. or thereabouts, E^ Arch (...)

Saint Nicholas, and placed therein black Canons regular, Augustines:

The people of this place make a great vaunt of the best wheat in all Kent or
Christendom.

Now here (gentle Reader) give me leave to speak a little more of the Priory
of Leedes, though casually misplaced, because forgotten.

I find (says Lambard) in a Heralds note (who belike made his conjecture by
some coat of Arms lately apparent) that one Leybourne, an Earl of Salisbury,
was the founder of this Priory. And indeed it is to be seen in the Annalls of
Saint Augustines of Canterbury, Mss^n ^ib. Cot.
that a Nobleman, called Roger Leybourne, was sometime of great authority
within this Shire, notwithstanding that, in his time he had tasted of both
fortunes: for in the days of king Henry the third, he was first one of that
coniuration, which was called the Barons war; from which faction Edward the
kings son won him by fair means to his part, and made him the bearer of
his privy purse. Afterward they agreed not upon the reckoning, so that the
Prince (charging him with great arrerage of account) seized his living for
satisfaction of the debt, by which occasion Roger once more became of the
Barons party. But after the pacification made at Kenelworth, he was eft-soones
received into favor, and was made Warden of the five Ports, and Lieutenant of
this whole Shire. Now though it cannot be true, that this man was the builder
of this Priory (for the same Annals say, that it was erected long before) yet
if he did but marry the heir, he might truly be termed the Patron or Founder
thereof: for by that name, not only the builders themselves, but their
posterity also (to whom the glory of their deeds did descend) were wont to be
called Patrons and Founders as well as they.

It is observed, by my Author, in this place speaking of the Priory; that in
ancient time, the greatest Personages held Monks, Friars and Nuns, in such
veneration and liking, that they thought no City in case to flourish, no house
likely to have long continuance, no Castle sufficiently defended, where was not
an Abbey, Priory, or Nunnery, either placed within the walls, or situate at
hand and near adjoining.

And surely (omitting the residue of the Realm) hereof only it came to pass,
that Dover had Saint Martins; Canterbury, Christ-Church; Rochester, Saint
Andrews; Tunbridge, the Friars; Maidstone, the Chanons; Greenwich, the
Obseruants; and this our Leedes, her Priory of Chanons at hand.

About two hundred years since, A quarrel between the Canons of Leedes and
the Monks of S. Albans.
the Prior of this House, with three of his Chanons, and others; laid violent
hands upon the body of a Monk of Saint Albans, whereupon many more quarrels
would have ensued, if that Boniface the ninth, Pope of Rome (hearing thereof)
had not by his Bull authorized the Abbot of Saint Edmundsbury to hear,
examine, and determine all controversies betwixt the two Houses, and to
absolute the delinquents, after competent satisfaction made to the wronged
parties. Thus goes the Bull.

tuarum testimonio litterarum ad sedem venerint Apostolicam absoluendi. Canonici

Dat. Lateran. xii. Kalend. Nouemb. Pontificatur nostri, Anno octauo.

I have the rather inserted this Bull, for that it may be the more plainly
understood; how the most of all causes in those times concerning the Clergy,
were arbitrated not always by the authority of the learned Bishops of this
land, but by Commissions purchased from the Bishops of Rome.

This Priory was valued in the Records of the late suppression, at three
hundred fourscore and two pounds of yearly revenue.

Mottenden, or Motindene.
Lambard speaking of Motindene (which name he deriues from two Saxon words,
Moo and Dene, which is the proud valley, a name imposed as he thinks for the
fertility thereof) says, That he has not heard, nor hitherto found any
thing touching the Religious House of Motindene in Hetcorne, The Religious
House at Motinden.
save only that the head thereof was called Minister, and that the House it
self was of the yearly value of sixty pounds. Neither would I (says he) have
affoorded it so much as paper, or place here, but only that you might
understand, with what number of buildings, variety of sects, and plenty of
possessions, Popery was in old time provided for, and furnished. No corner
(almost) without some Religious house or other: Their sects and orders were
hardly to be numbered; and as for their lands and revenues, it was a world to
behold them. I find that the yearly extent of the clear value of the
Religious livings within this Shire, amounted to five thousand pounds:
Bishoprics, Benefices, Friaries, Chaunteries, and Saints-offerings not
accounted. Which thing also I do the rather note, to the end that you may see,
how just cause is given us, both to wonder at the hot zeal of our ancestors
in their spiritual fornication, and to lament the coldness of our own
charity, toward the maintenance of the true Spouse of Jesus Christ. For, if
ever, now most truly is that verified, which the Poet long since said, Probitas
laudatur et alget.

Boxley.
William de Ipre (a Town in Flanders) the base son of Philip Viscount de
Ipre, Boxley Abbey.
Lieutenant to king Stephen, in the wars against Maud the Empress: for which
service the king created him Earl of Kent, founded this Abbey, Ann. 1146.
which he consecrated to the blessed Virgin Mary, and planted it with a Covent
of white Monks, of Saint Barnards order, which he translated hither from
Claravall in Burgundy, which as good children, were to follow and obey the
rules and ordinances of the Abbey of Claravall in all things. These are the
words in the institution.

Anno 1146. fundata est Boxleia in Cancia, Cart. Ant. in Arch. Turris. London.
filia Claravallis propria. And further, Quod ipsa Abbathia sit subdita
Abbathie de Claravalle, etc.

It was ordinary both beyond Sea and here in England, for one religious house
to beget another, as will appear by the sequel; for not many years after her
first foundation, this Abbey it self was the mother of Robertsbridge in
Sussex. The yearly value of this house was esteemed at the suppression to be
worth 218. l. 19. s. 10. d.

This Monastery in former times was famous for a wooden Roode, The Roode of
Grace at Boxley. Lamb. peramb.
by which the Priests for a long while deluded the common people, until their
fraud and Legierdemain was detected.

Bocton Malherb.
At Bocton Malherb, Camd. in Kent.
says learned Clarentieux, has dwelt a long time the family of the Wottons,
out of which in our remembrance flourished both Nicholas Wotton, Doctor of the
Laws, who being of the privy Council to king Henry the eighth, King Edward
the sixth, Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, sent in Embassage nine times to
foreign Princes, and thrice chosen Committee about Peace between the English,
French, and Scottish: lived a goodly time, and ran a long race in this life
with great commendation of piety and wisdom: and also Sir Edward Wotton,
whom for his approved wisdom in weighty affairs, Queen Elizabeth made
Controller of her house, and King James created Baron Wotton of Merley. If you
would know any more, read Hollinshead, Hollins. p. 1402. An. Reg Elis. 27
who has written a Treatise of this family from Richard Wotton, who flourished
in the reign of King Edward the first, unto these Wottons, who yet do live in
our memory.

This Church is honored with the sepulture of many of this noble progeny, but
I have no inscription nor Epitaph for any, save only for him who was twice
Lord Mayor of London. The first time in the third year of king Henry the
fifth: Nicholas Wotton Lord Mayor of London.
the second in the ninth of king Henry the sixth.

Here lies Nicholas Wotton Esquire....twice Lord Mayor of London.....who was
borne the 26. of October, 1372. and dyed Septem. 14. 1448.....being 76. years
of age.

Newenden.
This Town harbored the first Carmelite Friars that ever were in this
kingdom, Newenden Priory. The first Carmelite Friars in England. Lamb: peramb.
for about the midst of the reign of king Henry the third, this order came
over the Sea, arrived in this land, and made their nest here at Newenden; which
was at that time a woody and solitary place, and therefore (in common
opinion) the more fit for religious persons to inhabit; they were called
Carmelites, of a hill in Siria named Carmelus, where at the first a sort of
them lived solitarily, until by John, Patriarch of Jerusalem, they were drawn
into companies. Now to give these sanctimonious white Brethren (such mere
strangers) the better entertainment, one Sir Thomas Albuger knight, about the
year 1241. built for them here a fair house, calling it the Friery, which he
caused to be hallowed to the honor of the Virgin Mary; for that by Honorius
Quartus the Pope, they were appointed to a rule and order by the name of the
Brothers of Mary; which title liked themselves so well, that they procured of
Pope Urban the sixth, three years pardon for all such as would so call them.
But certain merry fellows (says mine Author) (seeing their vanity, and
knowing how little they were of kin to Mary the blessed Virgin) called them
the Brothers of Mary Aegiptiaca the harlot. Lambard.
Whereat the Pope was so offended, that he plainly pronounced them Heretics
for their labor.

He that was the Provost or principal of this Fraternity, was called the
Prior of the house. One of which, namely, William Starnefeld, writ a Treatise
of the original or beginning of this Order. What the value of this Priorie was
at the suppression I cannot learned.

Combewell.

In this village was a Monastery of black Canons, dedicated to S. Mary
Magdelene, and valued to be worth 80. l. 17. s. 5. d.

N^vill.
this old rhyme is engraven.

O Lord my Savior and hevenly Maker,
Have mercy on Elisabeth Graistock and Daker.
In what kings days this Lady might flourish, I have not made much search; the
character of the Inscription seems to be ancient, and so are the families of
the Nevils, Dacres, and Greystocks: as also of signal note, and exemplarie
nobleness in many parts of this kingdom; with the two first Surnames I do
often meet. Thus much here then of Greystocke out of Camden, as follows.

By Peterill, beside Petrianae (says he) stands Greystock, a Castle
belonging, not long since, to an honorable house, which derived their first
descent from one Ranulph Fitz-walter: Camd in Cumberland.
of which line William, called de Greystock wedded Mary, a daughter, and one of
the coheires of Sir Merley, Lord of Morpath: and he had a son named John,
who being childlesse, by license of king Edward the first, conveyed his
inheritance to Raph Granthorpe, the son of William, and his Aunts son by
the fathers side; whose male progeny flourished a long time in honor, with
the title of Lord Greistock: but about king Henry the seventh, his days
expired, and came to an end, and so the inheritance came by marriage unto the
Barons of Dacree: and the female heirs general of the last Baron Dacre, were
married unto Philip Earl of Arundell, and Lord William Howard, sons of
Thomas Howard, late Duke of Norfolk.

Pluckley, anciently written Plokele.
This Towneship or Parish was by Archbishop Lanfrancke (in the time of William
the Conqueror) given unto one John de Cobham, whose posterity assuming a
Surname from the place, did flourish here by the space of two hundred years,
until the daughters of Sir William of Pluckley knight, became the coheires of
this Manor. Amongst whom, she that only is known to have had issue, was
married unto John de Surenden, alias Sarenden, who upon the old seat, new
founded the Manor house, (a fair one at this day, and by the antiquity
thereof seems to have been the like, or much fairer at her first building)
which stands upon the very forehead of that hill which from this place does
reach Westward into Surrey. A situation so elegant, that it compares with most
that are, in rich pastures, healthful air, and plenty both of fuel and
timber: but above all, in a very delicate and various prospect. From the owner
it then received, and still retains, the name of Surenden, although from that
family it did immediately by a daughter pass to the Noble and spreading house
of Haute, whose first child, being daughter and coheire, Christian, was
married unto John Dering, son of Richard, son of Sir John Dering of
Westbroke, knight. In the possession of which family, the name of Surenden has
(by continuance) gotten its Masters Surname, to distinguish it from another of
the same appellation within two miles, and so is known by the name of So in
this County, Sutton Valence, Horton Kirby, and others, have like distinctiue
surnames.
Surenden Dering. And through many descents (having been at no time bought nor
sold) the gift of Lanfranke now rests in person of Sir Edward Dering, knight,
and Baronet, Lieutenant of his Majesty's Castle of Dover, and of his Cinque
ports; the third of that name and family of Dering, which have enjoyed this
Office, being a place of especial trust, of honor and command.

In this Church, dedicated to S. Nicholas, and in our Ladies Chapel there,
now belonging to Sir Antony Dering of Surenden Dering knight, and founded by
Richard Dering Esquire, in the reign of king Henry the sixth, (as appears by
his Arms carved on the bottom of the Arches, which are Or, a Salter sables,
and Dering and Haute quartered Or, a Salter sables, and Or, a cross engraled
gules, thereon a cressant Argent) are several grauestones very fairly
figured, with pourtraitures in armor to the length; first one for John Dering
of Surenden Esquire, who lived in the days of King Richard the second, Henry
the fourth, and Henry the fifth; some of the brass is torn away, that which
remains is accordingly as follows.

John Dering.
HIC IACET andCpunc;


This riming Epitaph is inlaid with brass about the Verge of this Monument.

Next unto him lies entombed his son Richard Dering in this form, to whose
memory no Inscription is remaining. Richard Der^^




Richard Dering of Surenden Dering, Esquire, gave as I have it by relation) the
hangings of rich and fair cloth of Arras, which adorn the Quire of the
Cathedral Church in Canterbury, upon the suite of his son Richard Dering a
Monk there; who, according to his Monkish Heraldry, has figured in their
several bordures, his Rebus, or Name devises, viz. a Dear and a Ring, in stead
of Arms, although six embroydered Cushions, then given for the Priors seat,
and since used in the Deanes Pewes, have the Arms of Dering embroydered on
them, and empaled with Bertyn and Eyton his two wives.

Richard Dering the Monk, ^^ow. Annal.
was one of the adherents to Elisabeth Barton, the holy Maid of Kent, in her
fained hypocrisy, and traitorous practices.

In the same Chapel lies John Dering, John Dering.
Esquire, who was great grandchilde to the foresaid Richard Dering of Surenden,
whose Altar tomb is since laid flat. He dyed 1550. and has there his figure
in the wall, kneeling with his Surcote of Arms; with him is buried Margaret
his wife, sister and sole heir of Thomas Brent, Esquire.

Underneath the figure of Richard Dering, An Eschurchion.
before remembered, is an Escocheon with eight coats quartered. First Dering a
Salter. 2. Haute a Cross ingraled with a cressant. 3 Brent, a wiuervolant. 4 a
Fesse cotized. 5. Surenden a Berid between two Cottesses nebuly on the
outsides. 6. Pluckley a Flower deluce. 7. Barkley a Cheuoron between ten

At the foot of this Chapel, within the Church, under four several
Grauestones, every one inlaid with figures of brass at length, the men lying
in Armor, are buried as follows.

Io. Dering and Julian his wife.
John Dering Esquire, who dyed Ann. Dom. 1517. and Julian his wife, sister of
Sir John Darrell knight, who dyed 1526.

Nic Dering and (...) his wife.
On their right hand lies Nicholas Dering, Esquire, their eldest son, and
Alice his wife, the daughter and coheire of the eldest house of Bettenham.

(...) Dering and Bene^ his wife.
On their left hand under an Arch, with the like pourtraiture in brass at
length, lies their second son, Richard Dering Esquire, the Kings Lieutenant
of Dover Castle, and the Cinque Ports, under five Lord Wardens. He dyed 1546.
And with him is buried Benet his wife, of the ancient family of Brockholl.

Diverse others of this most ancient and right worthy progeny, lie here
interred; of whom (their burials being but of later times) the order of my
method will not give me leave to speak.

Hen. and Rich. Malemaines.
In the body of this Church are two Grauestones, under one of which lies the
body of Henry Malemaines, Esquire, and under the other (with his portraiture at
length in brass) Richard Malemaines Esquire, who dyed 1440. their coat of
Arms thereupon engraven. Ermyn a cheffe gules, three left hands Argent.

Bethersden under Pluckley hill.
In this Church are the Arms of Surenden twice singly, and once empaled with
Crouch, which Surenden was there the principal Inhabitant in the time of
Edward the second, being owner of a place there called Surenden, which now
belongs to a right worthy gentleman Edward Chute Esquire. And is seated with
the view of the other Surenden, belonging as aforesaid to Sir Edward Dering.

Charing.
In the year 1590. this Church was with fire consumed all but the very stones;
which fire it caught from a piece discharged at a Pigeon then upon the Church.
The windows and the Grauestones (wherein diverse of the ancient and worthy
family of Brent were memorized) at that time were defaced: yet on the outside
of the Bellfree do remain carved in stone, the badge of Edward the fourth
(being a Rose within the Sunne-beames) and a Wyuer being the Arms of Hugh
Brent Esquire; who in the reign of Edward the fourth, was the principal
Founder of that Bellfree, which was before of wood. From the time of Henry the
sixth, the family of Brent (being branched out of the ancient stock of Brent
in Somersetshire, of which house Sir Robert de Brent was a Baron of the
Parliament in the time of Edward the first) has flourished here as the prime
name of this Parish, until Thomas Brent Esquire (the last male of this line)
did remove to Willisborough, where he dyed issuelesse.

On the South side of the Chancell here, and annexed to the Church, is a
convenient Chapel founded by Amy Brent widow of William Brent Esquire, who
dyed in the reign of Ric. the third; this (with the Church) being fired, is
now in the hands of workmen to be repaired, by Sir Edward Dering knight and
Baronet, to whom the right of this Chapel is derived, as well in blood from
the Brents, as by composition between him and M. Brent Dering of Charing, who
now is the owner of the ancient house of the Brents there, which is full stored
with the Badges of Edward the fourth, in every quarry of glass within the
Hall-window. In which house also (as it goes by tradition) John Brent Esquire,
feasted King Henry the eight, as he passed this way toward his then intended
siege of Bullen. But this name of Brent is for nothing more famous, then for
the warlike exploits of that wild madbraine Falques, or Falco de Brent; Brent
the Madbraine.
who made it nothing to raise war against kings; to besiege and take Castles,
to spoil Abbeyes, pull down Churches, ransacke all the adjoining territories,
and where I write of such a touch of wickedness? but more of him hereafter,
what not which had English persons of especial note, as have been interred in
foreign nations.

Lyd.
Of Lyd I have spoken a little in another place, yet here give me leave to
speak a little more upon further information. Rich. Dering and Tho. his son.
In this Church of Lyd were two Grauestones of Richard Dering, who dyed in the
reign of king Richard the second, and Thomas his son, one of them had fair
portraitures with ornaments engraven thereon: but the loss of some of the
brass, with the remote absence of his posterity, have given occasion for
another name to superscribe that stone; although at that time the best, if not
the only names of note and gentry there, were Septuanus and Dering: at which
time Dering was here owner of Westbrooke, and of Deuge Marsh place, which name
has been of great and ancient possessions in Lyd, Midley, Promhill, and old
Rumney, whereof a part was the level of four hundred Acres of land, called
yet by the name of Derings: and on the other side of Lyd above threescore Acres
by the name of Derings Droff. From hence John Dering Esquire, in the time of
Henry the seventh, was taken out of his house and carried into France, from
whence by ransom he freed himself.

Chart Magna.
Between the Chancell and the North Chapel of this Church, is an
Altar-Tombe, round about the verge of which, is engraven this Epitaph following
in brass, and betwixt every word the figure of a well, alluding to the name of
the parties there underneath interred.

James Goldwell of this family, Bishop of Norwich, was a repairer of this
Church, as appears by this broken Inscription in the top cross window.

And in the East window it is thus to be read in the glass.

In a North window of the North Chapel have been sixteen pourtraitures of
men in glass, all kneeling, whereof most remain, whose names are as
follows. The builders o^ founders of this Church.

In midst of whom, as the Priests then are, Dominus Richardus Medhurst, and
Dominus Walterus Wilcock.

Now, as it goes by tradition, from the father to the son, these were the
builders of this Church.

In the midst of the East-window, in the South Chapel of this Church, is
the picture of the foresaid Bishop Goldwell, kneeling, and in every quarry a
golden well or fountain (his Rebus or Name devise) and cross the window
inscribed:

whereof is altogether perished; which in all likelihood was made to the memory
of Sir William Barry, knight, the husband of the fore-remembred Isabell.

At the lower end of the Church, and near to the Bellfree, lies the body of
one of these Barryes pourtraied in complete armor, about the Verge of his

Camden in his Chorographicall description of Ireland, and in the County of
Cork, writes greatly to the honor of this surname of Barry. These are his
words as follows.

Beneath Cork (says he) the river, parting in twain, enuironeth a large and
very pleasant Island, over against the principal dwelling house of that most
ancient and noble family of the Barries, which thereupon is called Barry Court.
For, that family is derived from Robert de Barry an English man, a personage of
great worth, and renowned: who notwithstanding chose rather among the first to
be chief indeed, then to seem chief: who in the winning of Ireland, Robert
Barry the first in (...) land that broughthawke to hand:
received wounds and hurt: and the first man he was in Ireland that manned and
brought the Hawke to hand. His posterity by their long approved loyalty, and
martial prowess, deserved to receive of the kings of England, first the title
of Baron Barry, afterward of Vicount Butiphant, and for their great lands and
wealth, gat among the people the surname of Barry More, that is, Barry the
Great.

..... Johannes Fynch Armiger, Qui obiit 19. die Mensis Maij, Ann. Dom 1442.

This I conceive to be some younger branch of the Nobly descended family of the
Finches, of whom there is mention made among the Monuments in Braborne Church
before, where they are styled Herbert, vel Finch, not unaptly thereby
continuing the memory of their original name and ancestry, as being lineally
descended from Hen. Fuz-Herbert, Chamberlain to king Henry the first, who
married the daughter and heir to Sir Robert Corbert: Vide Vincent contra
Brook page 130.
and had issue by her, a son named Herbert, who likewise had issue a son,
named Herbert Fitz-Herbert. Who by his first wife Luce, daughter and coheire of
Milo, Earl of Hereford, and high Constable of England, had issue a son,
named Peter Fitz Herbert (from whom the Herberts Earls of Penbrooke are
descended) and by Matilda his second wife (after his death re-married to the
Lord Columbarij,) he had issue M S. Tho Talbot. clerici Rotulorum in. um Land.

Matthew Fitz-Herbert, who was one of the Magnates, or Barons at the making of
Magna Charta, and was likewise one of those potent Noblemen for the king, that
made the accord between king John, and the Barons at Runnyng Mead, between
Windsore and Stanes: his son likewise, called Herbert Fitz Matthew, was the
fourth Baron that is mentioned in the Roll of the Parliament at Tewkesbury. The
change of this name Finch, seems to have been about the latter end of king
Hen. the third (at which time many other families suffered like alteration) as
appears by a supersedeas, Ann. 8. E. 2. therein mentioning, that Herbertus
Filius Herberti dicti Finch, was a Ward, 28. E. primi, and so could not
personally serve with the king in his wars in Scotland, and therefore was
released of his Escuage for all his lands in Kent and Sussex, which, together
with some of the ancient patrimony and seven knights sees at Nethersfield in
the County of Sussex, are not yet alienated from this honorable family, who by
their paternall Ancestors and Matches are descended from many honorable houses,
and especially by Sir Moyle Finches Lady, Elizabeth, sole daughter and heir to
Sir Thomas Heneage, Vicechamberlaine and Councellor of Estate to Queen
Elizabeth, by whom she had many children: and in her widdowhood received from
King James the dignity of Vicecountesse of Maydestone; and by King Charles was
created Countess of Winchelsey, to her and to her heirs Males.

ARCHBISHOPS OF CANTERBVRY CANONIZED SAINTS.
^. Austin Archbishop.
ANd first to begin with the first, which was Austin the Monk, famous for the
many miracles which he wrought, if we may believe the Legend. Amongst which,
this following is said to be one.

Saint Austyn entryd into Dorsetshyr (give me leave to use the character of my
old Agon) and came into a town where as were wicked people, and refusyd his
doctryn and preching utterly, and droof him out of the town, castyng on him the
tails of Thornback, or like fishes. Wherefore he bysought almighty God to show
his Judgment on them: And God sent to them a shameful token. For the children
that were borne after in that place had tails, as it is said, till they
repentyd them.

It is said comynly that this fill at Strode in Kent, but blessed be God at
this day is no such deformyte.

The first of these fables is likewise written by Alexander Esseby, says
Lambard, and the later by Polydore Virgil, who fathers it upon Thomas Becket
(handling that hot contention between king Henry the second, and Thomas
Becket) says, that Becket (being at the length reputed for the kings enemy)
began to be so commonly neglected, contemned, and hated, that when as it
happened him upon a time to come to Stroude, the inhabitants thereabouts (being
desirous to despite that good Father) sticked not to cut the tail from the
horse on which he road, binding themselves thereby with a perpetual reproach:
For afterward (by the will of God) it so happened, that every one which came
of that kindred of men which had played that naughty pranke, were borne with
tails, even as brute beasts be.

Thus Polidore Virgils History (howsoever if you respect the style, method, and
matter, a good work) is blemished with this, and other old wives tales and
follies. ^olidor. the Popes collectour.
For as he was by office a collectour of the Peterpence to the Popes gain and
lucre, so shows he himself throughout by practice, a covetous gatherer of
lying fables, fained to advance, not Peter's, but the Popes own Religion,
kingdom, and Miter, says my foresaid Author.

The day of the Translation was anciently kept holy, the 26. day of May.

^. Honorius Archbishop.
The next canonized Archbishop which I find, was Honorius, who was vnus ex
discipulis beati Pape Gregorij vir magne reuerentie, and in rebus
Ecclesiasticis sublimiter instructus: one of the Scholars of blessed Pope
Gregory, a man of great reverence, and in Ecclesiastical affairs, highly
instructed; says Capgraue, in the life of the holy Saint.

Honorius propter virtutem et Euangelij predicandi studium, Hist. Eccl. Ang.
Sex^. sar. c. 8.
honorandus plane et suspiciendus.

Honorius, for his virtue and studious endeavor of propagating the Gospel,
thoroughly to be honored and had in admiration, says Harpsfeld.

Many are the miracles attributed to his holiness, which were performed
before, upon, and after the translation of his Relics; which are needless to
relate, being like the rest of that kind, incredible.

The third Saint of this See in Capgraues Calender, S. Deodat Archbishop.
is, Deus-dedit, A deo datus, or Deodat, for before his name was Frithona, (so
named after his election to this Archbishopricke) of which a late writer thus
descants in his Canto of the Catalogue of ancient English Saints.

Of Canterbury here with those I will begin, M Drayton, Polyol. 24* Song.

That first Archbishops See, on which there long has bin
So many men devout, as raisd that Church so high,
Much reverence, and have won their holy Hierarchy:
Of which the first that did with goodness so in flame
The hearts of the devout (that from his proper name)
As one (even) sent from God, the souls of men to save,
The title unto him of Deodat they gave.
Verus erat Dei cultor: vitiorum mortificator: Virtutum amator: verbi diuini
non segnis sator, etc.

He was a true worshipper of the everliving God: a mortifier of vices: a lover
of virtues: no slow unprofitable sower of the divine word; and so forth. In the
like phrase much more is delivered by Capgraue, of this holy Bishop and
Confessor. He writ a book of the Bishops of Canterbury, his predecessor, as
witnesses Pitseus.

That learned Priest Theodore succeeded Deodat, S. Theodore Archbishop.
as in seat, so in Sainting. Unto this man all the British Bishops, and
generally all Britain, yielded obedience; first he was in his life, as also in
his discipline, exercising the authority of his place wondrous severely. Never
before his time had England so many happy days, nor so many learned men, as
under him, and a little after. Much might be said of his sanctity, out of
Capgraue, and others: but I will make an end, with his end, out of an old
Manuscript.

Theodor yat was of Cawnterbury,
Erchbysshcoppe than, and eke the high Prymat*
Of fowrscor yer of age so than did die,
That twenty yer and two held that estat,
To great honor, and worschippe fortunat.
The yer of Crist sir hundryd forscore and ten,
Was, when his sowl fro flesh was lesed clen.
^. Odo Archbishop.
Odo, surnamed Seuerus, the Confessor, for his singular austeritie of life,
and many virtues, is reckoned in the new Legend amongst the Saints. Of whom the
foresaid Author of Polyalbion thus sings.

Then Odo the Severe, who highly did adorn
That See (yet being of unchristened Parents borne,
Whose country Denmark was, but in East-England dwelt)
He being but a child, in his clear bosom felt
The most undoubted truth, and yet vnbaptiz'd long;
But as he grew in years, in spirit so growing strong.
And as the Christian Faith this holy man had taught,
He likewise for that faith in sundry battles fought.
S. Dunstane Archbishop.
Dunstan succeeded Odo, whose miracles by him wrought, are said to be so many,
and so far beyond belief, that where to begin I know not, much less where
to end; I will look upon him as I find him lying on his deathbed; where he
saw many strange visions of heavenly joys were showed unto him for his great
comfort. And upon holy Thursday (to use the words of the old Legend) he sent
for all his brethren, and asked of them foryeuenesse, and alsoo forgave them
all trespaces, and assoyled them of all their sins, and the third dey aftyr
he passyd out of this world to God, full of virtues, the year of our Lord ix
honderd lxxxviii, and his soul was borne up to Heaven with merry song of
angels, all the people hering that were at his death: and his body lies at
Cawnterbury in a worschipful shryne, where as owr Lord shows for his Servant
S. Dunston many fair and great miracles; wherefore owr Lord be pr^ysed world
wythouten end. Amen.

His relics, says Capgraue, were removed to Glastenbury, about four and
twenty years after his departure. And so it is very probable, for there he was
first a Brother of the House, and afterward Abbot: there the devil came to
him dancing, by which the devils merriment, Dunstan knew the instant time of
the death of Edmund, the Brother of Athelstane slain at Pucklechurch. Of which
my old Rimer, Rob. of Gloucester.

Saint Dunstone was at Glastonbery tho the king yhurte was
And yut in the same instant.
stound he wiste of this cas.
For the deuell before him came dawncyng and lowgh,
And as hit were pleying made game enowgh;
This holy.
hely man wiste anon why his joy was,
And that for the kings harm he made such solas.
Dunstone toward Pukelcherch dight himself blive,
So that men told him by the way the king was out of livs.
Capgraue.
But at another time this merry devil (or some other) came to him in another
mood, in likeness of a Bear, and would have handled with rough Mittins, as
the proverb is, yet Dunstane had the better in the conflict, being never
abasht with such an hellish encounter, upon which the foresaid Author of
Polyolbion does thus comment.

-- Dunstan as the rest arose through many Sees, Song. 1^.

To this Archtipe at last ascending by degrees,
There by his power confirmd, and strongly credit won,
To many wondrous things which he before had done,
To whom when (as they say) the Devil once appeared,
This man so full of faith not once at all afear'd,
Strong conflicts with him had, in Miracles most great.
The day consecrated to the memory of this Saint, was the 19. of May; more of
him (if it be not needless) when I come to Glastonbury.

Elphege (of wom I have spoken elsewhere) borne of great parentage, S. Elphege
Arch. Martyr.
brought up in all good learning at Derehirst, not far from Gloucester, a man
of wonderful abstinence, never eating, drinking, or sleeping, more then
necessity compelled him, spending his time altogether either in prayer, study,
or other necessary business, was stoned to death (like another Stephen) by
the Danes at Greenwich, in the year 1012. canonized for a Saint, and allowed
the 19. day of April for celebration of his memory.

-- suth ye yer of grace
A thousand and twelf they ladde him to a place Rob. Glocest.

Wythowte the town of Grenewyche, and stened him with stenes
As men did Saint Stephenne, and all to bruysed his benes
This was do the Ester weke in the Saturday,
As mor plenner in his lif se there of men may.
Egelnoth surnamed The Good, is likewise calendred amongst these Sainted
Archbishops. S. Egelnoth Archbishop*
He was the son of an Earl, called Agelmare, and is said to have been Deane
of Christ-Church in Canterbury: which at that time was replenished for the most
part with Canons, wearing the habit and garments of Monks; but in profession
and manner of life, differing much from them. Therefore when as in that same
terrible tithing of the Danes (in the time of Elphege) all the Monks were
slain, except only four, the Canons that were now the greater number, gave
unto their governor the name of Deane, from which place he was taken to be
Archbishop.

Going to Rome to fetch his Pall, he bought an arm of that blessed Father S.
Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, for an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of
gold, Godwin.
and bestowed it upon the Church of Couentrie. He bestowed great pains and
cost in repairing his Church and Monastery, destroyed and burnt by the Danes,
and by his good advise, directed King Knute (that favored him exceedingly)
unto many honorable enterprises. He dyed, October. 29. Ann. 1038. having sat
Archbishop seventeen years, and upward. -- Egelno^h again much graced that
sacred Seat,
^
Who for his godly deeds, surnamed was the Good,
Not boasting of his birth, though com'n of Royal blood:
For that, nor at the first, a Monks mean Cowle despised,
With winning men to God, who never was sufficed.
-- Eadfine next ensues,
^. Ea^^^^e Archbishop.
To propagate the truth, no toil that did refuse.
He was a secular Priest, and first Chaplain unto king Harold, who preferred
him to the Bishopric of Winchester, from whence he was removed to this See
of Canterbury. He departed this life October. 28. An. 1050. after he had
continued Archbishop twelve years almost: All which time he was much oppressed
with sickness; he was interred in his own Church, and at the place of his
burial, many miracles are said to have been wrought.

S. Lanfranke Archbishop*
Lanfranke (of whom I have written before) is recorded by Capgraue amongst our
English Saints: who says, that upon his first entrance to this Metropoliticall
government, he found the Monks of Canterbury, sicut omnes fere tum temporis in
Anglia secularibus similes: as all the rest were almost at that time in
England, like to secular persons: for, Venari, aucupari, et potibus indulgere
consueuerunt: They accustomed to hunt, hawke, and give their mind to excessive
drinking, which after a short time, by gentle persuasions, he reclaymed. He was
a man affable, pleasant, and humble, skillful in many Sciences, prudent in
counsel, and government of things, and for Religion and life most holy. Meruit
ergo inter Sanctos annumerari: Therefore he deserves to be numbered amongst the
Saints.

S. Anselm Archbishop.
Anselm for integrity of life, and depth of learning, even admirable, in
regard whereof, and of the many miracles which are said to be wrought by him
living, and by his Relics, he being dead; he was canonized a Saint, about
four hundred years after his decease, at the great charges of John Moorton,
one of his Successors in the Archbishopricke.

Out of his learned brain he brought forth into the world many profound works,
at the least fifty several books or Treatises: many of which are still
extant. The miracles likewise attributed to his holiness, are many, mentioned
by Capgraue.

The next that comes into this Catalogue, is that far famed Saint, Thomas
Becket, S. Thomas commonly called Thomas of Canterbury*
of whom I have already spoken enough in another place. Thus much then at this
time out of Polyolbion, as follows.

Saint Thomas Becket then, which Rome so much did honored.
hery,
As to his christened name it added Canterbury;
There to whose sumptuous Shrine the near succeeding ages,
So mighty offerings sent, and made such pilgrimages,
Concerning whom, the world since then has spent much breath,
And many questions made both of his life and death.
If he were truly just, he has his right, if no,
Those times were much to blame, that have him reckoned so.
Edmund (a man famous for his virtue and great learning) was borne at Abingdon
in Barkeshire, S. Edmund Archbishop.
being son to one Edward Rich a Merchant, his mothers name was Mabell. In
their elder years they forsook each other by mutual consent, and betook
themselves to a Monastical life. Edmund their son they caused to be brought
up in University College in Oxford. Having attained to reasonable perfection
in the knowledge of Divinity (whereunto his study was chiefly addicted) he
applied himself to preaching, wherein he took great pains, namely, in the
Counties of Oxford, Gloucester, and Worcester, until such time as he was
called to the Treasureship of Salisbury. From whence (little knowing of any
such matter, and much against his mind) he was chosen (at the Popes request,
to the Monks of Christ-Church, being as then at Rome) to be Archbishop of this
See, and consecrated at Canterbury, with all honor possible, by Roger, Bishop
of London, the fourth of the Nones of April, about the year 1230. King Henry
the third, thirteen Bishops, one and forty Lords and Earls, and others
innumerable being there present; as it is thus recorded in the Annalls of the
Monastery of Wauerley in Surrey.

But howsoever he was thus solemnly consecrated, he presently fell into the
kings displeasure, by opposing himself against the marriage of Elianor the
kings sister with Simon Mountfort, Earl of Leicester, because upon the death
of the Earl Marshall, her first husband, she had vowed chastity. To have this
vow dispensed withal, the King procured the Pope to send a Legate into
England, his name was Otto a Cardinal. Him also this Archbishop offended, and
that so grievously, by reprehending his monstrous covetousness, his bribery
and extortion, as ever after he sought to work him all the mischief that he
might. The Monks of Rochester had presented unto this Archbishop one Richard
de Wendouer, demanding of him consecration unto the Bishopric of their
Church, which he utterly denied to afford, knowing the presented, to be a
very unlearned and insufficient man. Hereupon the Monks appealed to Rome,
which the Archbishop understanding of, hasted him thither also. Otto the Legate
endeavored to stay him at home, and failing thereof, did his errand so well at
Rome, as not only in that suite, but another also which he had against Hugh
Earl of Arundell in another cause of appeal, he was overthrown, and
condemned in a thousand Marks charges to his great disgrace and
impouerishment. Being at Rome, he had complained of many great abuses in
England, and amongst the rest, of the long vacancie of Bishoprics. The Pope
seemed willing to redress these things, and namely, concerning that matter,
set down this order, (...) Popes absolute power.
That if any Cathedral Church continued void above six months, it should be
lawful for the Archbishop to confer it where he list, ^
as well as any smaller Benefice. The procuring of this order cost him a great
sum of money. Yet no sooner was his back turned, but the Pope, at the kings
request, revoked the same. Being thus continually vexed, thwarted, and
disgraced, he departed into voluntary exile, and there bewayling the misery of
his country, H^s ty^^nny
spoiled and wasted by the tyranny of the Pope, spent the rest of his days in
continual tears. Through extreme grief and sorrow, or (as some think) too
much fasting, he fell first into a Consumption, and after into a strange kind
of Ague. Whereupon he thought good to remove from the Abbey of Pontiniac in
France (where he had layen ever since his coming out of England) and there
departed this life the sixteenth of the Kalends of December, 1242. His heart
and entrails were buried at Soissy, his body at Pontiniac.

^
Sanctus Edmundus Cantuarie Archiepiscopus, plenus virtutibus, et san^titate
migrauit ab hoc seculo, XVI. Kal. December. et apud Pontiniacum sepultus est;
Cuius merita miracula testantur.

Hic erat Edmundus anima tum corpore mundus,
Quem non immundus poterat peruertere mundus:
Anglorum Genti faueas Edmunde petenti.
Within six years after his death he was canonized a Saint, by Innocentius the
fourth, who appointed the foresaid day of his death for ever to be kept holy in
memory of him. Jews the French king caused his body to be translated to a more
honorable Tomb then it was first laid in, and bestowed a sumptuous Shrine
upon him, covered with gold and silver, and richly adorned with many precious
stones: where our Lord (says his Legend) has showed many a fair miracle for
his holy servaunt Saint Edmonde.

This Edmund is the last Archbishop of Canterbury that I find to have been
canonized; howsoever I dare pronounce, that since his days to these present
times, wherein we live; we have had many Archbishops both for life and
learning, as worthy the honor of canonization, as was himself, or any of
these by me before remembered.

Thus much of this Diocese until I be further stored of funeral Monuments,
or other matters therein according to my method, either by my self, or my
friends; only let me tell you for a conclusion, that the whole Province of
this Bishopric of Canterbury: The conclusion of this Diocesie.
which first of all was apparelled by Austin the Monk with the Archbishop of
Londons Pall (as I have in part touched before) was at the first divided by
Theodore (seventh Bishop) into five Diocesses only; howbeit in process of
time, it grew to twenty and one, The (...) of (...).
besides it self, leaving to York (which by the first institution should have
had as many as it) but Durham, Carleil, and Chester only (except you reckon
the Isle of Man.) And whereas by the ordinance of Pope Gregory, either of these
Archbishops should have under him twelve inferior Bishops, and that neither of
them should be subject, or of less grace and dignity then other; Lanfrancke
(thinking it good reason that he should make a Conquest of the English Clergy,

recovered it from him; so that ever since the one is called, Totius Angliae
Primas: and the other, Angliae Primas: without any further addition.

Moreover, whereas before time, the place of this Archbishop in the general
Council, was to sit next to the Bishop of Saint Ruffines. Anselme (the
successor of this Lanfranke) (for recompense of the service he had done in
oppugning the marriage of Priests, The Archbishops (...) the general (...).
and resisting the king, for the inuestiture of Clerks) was by Pope Vrbane
endowed with this accession of honor, that he and his Successors, should
from thenceforth have place in all general Councels, at the Popes right foot,
who then said withal: Includamus hunc in orb nostro, tanquam alterius orbis
Papam,


Let us include this Bishop in our own Orb, as it were the Pope or Father of
another world.

In former ages (says Camden in this tract) during the Roman Hierarchy, the
Archbishops of Canterbury were Primates of all Britain, Legates to the Pope,
and as Vrbane the second said, The Patriarchs, as it were, of another world.

And thus the Archbishops of Canterbury, by the favor which Austin had with
Gregory the Great, by the power of Lanfranke, and by the industry of Anselme,
Lambard
were much exalted: but how much that was to the grievous displeasure, and
pining envy of the Archbishops of York, you shall perceive by that which
follows.

King Henry the first, kept upon a time his stately Christmas at Windsore,
where (the manner of our kings then being at certain solemn times to wear
their Crowns) Thurstine of York having his Cross borne up before him)
offered to set the Crown upon the kings head. But William of Canterbury
withstood it stoutly, and so prevailed by the favor of the King, and the help
of the standers by, that Thurstine was not only disappointed of his purpose,
but he (and his Cross also) thrust quite out of the doors.

William of York (the next in succession after Thurstine, both in the Sea and
Quarrel) perceiving that the force of his Predecessor prevailed nothing,
attempted by his own humble means (first made to the king, and after to the
Pope) to win the Coronation of king Henry the second, from Theobald the next
Archbishop of Canterbury: But when he had received repulse in that sort of
suite also, and found no way left to make auengement upon his enemy, he
returned home all wroth, and (as it was suspected) wreaked the anger upon
himself.

After this another hurly burly happened in a Synod assembled at Westminster, in
the time of King Henry the second, before Cardinal Hugo (Pope Alexanders
Legate) between Richard and Roger, then Archbishops of these two Sees, upon
occasion, that Roger of York coming of purpose (as it should seem) first to
the assembly, had taken up the place on the right hand of the Cardinal: Which
when Richard of Canterbury had espied, he refused to sit down in the second
room; complaining greatly of this prejudice done to his See. Whereupon after
sundry replies of speech, the weaker in disputation (after the manner of
Schoole-boyes in the streets) descended from hot words, to hasty blows: in
which encounter the Archbishop of Canterbury (through the multitude of his
attendants) obtained the better. So that he not only plucked the other out of
his place, and all to rent his casule, Chimer, and Rochet, but also disturbed
the holy Synod therewithal; in such wise, that the Cardinal, for fear,
betook him to his feet, the company departed, their business undone, and the
Bishops themselves moved suite at Rome, for the finishing of their
controversy. By these, and such other successes, on the one side, the Bishops
of Canterbury following, took such courage, that from thenceforth they would
not permit the Bishops of York to bear up the Cross, either in their
presence, or Province.

And on the other side, the Bishops of York conceived such grief of heart,
disdain and offense, that from time to time they spared no occasion to attempt
both the one and the other.

Whereupon, in the time of a Parliament holden at London, in the reign of King
Henry the third, Boniface, Archbishop of Canterbury, interdicted the Londiners,
because they had suffered the Bishop of York to bear up his Cross whiles he
was in the City. And much ado there was (within a few years after) between
Robert Kilwarby of Canterby, and William Giffard of York, because he of York
advanced his Cross, as he passed through Kent toward the general Council.

The like happened also, at two other several times, between Friar Peckham,
Archbishop of Canterbury, and William Wickwane, and John de Roma, Archbishops
of York, in the days of King Edward the first. At the length, the matter
being yet once more set on foot, between Simon Islip (the Archbishop of this
Province, and his adversary the incumbent of York for that time) King Edward
the third, The end of the strife for the Primacie.
in whose reign that variance was revived, resumed the matter into his own
hand, and made a final composition between them. The which he published
under his broad Seal to this effect. First, that each of them should freely,
and without impeachment of the other, bear up his Cross in the others
Province; but yet so, that he of York and his Successors for ever, in sign
of subjection, should within two months after their inthronization, either
bring, or send to Canterbury, the image of an Archbishop bearing a Cross, or
some other Jewel, wrought in fine gold, to the value of forty pounds, and
offer it openly there upon Saint Thomas Beckets Shryne: then, that in all
Synodes of the Clergy, and assemblies where the King should happen to be
present, he of Canterbury should have the right hand, and the other the left.
Finally, that in broad streets, and highways, their Crosse-bearers should go
together, but that in narrow lanes, and in the entries of doors and gates, the
Crosier of Canterbury should go before, and the other follow, and come behind.

Thus (as you see) the Bishops of Canterbury evermore prevailing by favor, or
other means; they of York were driven in the end, to give over in the plain
field.

Here ends the Diocese of Canterbury*
ANCIENT FUNERAL MONVMENTS WITHIN THE Diocese of ROCHESTER.
THis Bishopric is so ouershadowed by the nearness and greatness of the Sea
of Canterbury, that it looks but like a good Benefice, for one of his Graces
Chaplains; yet for antiquity and dignity of a long succession of reverend
Lord Bishops, it may equally compare with its neighbor of Canterbury. For they
had both one Founder, to wit, Ethelbert king of Kent, who built this Church to
the honor of Saint Andrew, and endowed it with certain lands, which he called
Priestfield, in token that Priests should be sustained therewithal. Unto
which, Iustus a Roman (of whom before) was consecrated Bishop by Saint
Augustine, Ethelbert assenting thereto by his presence.

This City pent within so straight a room, was called in the time of the

Diocese, may make their vaunt, of their impregnable fortification by the Name
Royal; the maine defense of Britains great Monarchy, of the prowess of
their ancient Inhabitants, of the pleasant situation of so many country*
towns, and of the profits arising from the fruitfulness of the soil. Of all
which read, if you please, this Hexasticon.

This Diocese (for the most part) is severed from that of Canterbury by the
river of Medway: it consists only of four distinct Deaneries, namely,
Rochester, Malling, Dartford, and Shorham. Yet Shorham is but a Peculiar to the
Archbishop, who holds his prerogative wheresoever his lands do lie.

This Bishopric is valued in the Exchequer at 358. l. 3. s. 7. d. farthing,
and was wont to pay to the Pope for first fruits 1300. ducates, and for
Peter Pence, 5. l. 12. s.

Eighty Bishops and one have sitten in this Chair of Rochester, more in
number by nine then in that of Canterbury.

succeeding Iustus, three amongst others lie here interred (howsoever no
remembrance is now remaining of them, by any funeral Monument) most notable:
Paulinus, Gundulphus, and Gilbertus. Of which, the first, after his death, was
honored for a Saint. The second was the best Benefactour that ever this Church
found. The third was so hateful and injurious to the Monks, that they neither
esteemed him while he was living, nor wailed him at all, after that he was dead.

Paulinus, Paulinus Bishop of Rochester, and first of York.
a Roman borne, was first made Bishop of York by Iustus his predecessor in
this place, as then Archbishop of Canterbury; about the 21. day of July, in the
year of our Lord, 625. and so he is reckoned to be the first Archbishop of
that Province. Beda. l. 2. c. ^.
Yet I find a Succession of British Archbishops of that place long before his
time, ever since the year of Grace, one hundred and eighty, or thereabouts.
Wherein Lucius, king of the Britains, received the Christian faith; the last
of which race, was one Tadiacus; who, at the coming in of the Saxons, was,
with most of his countrymen, enforced to fly into the mountanous countries of
Cornwall, and Wales, Mss. in bib. Cot.
and so consequently to forsake his pontifical Grace and Dignity. Of all
which may it please you read these verses out of the collections of Tho.
Talbot, sometime keeper of Records in the Tower.

But to return again to Paulinus, from whom I am by occasion digressed, who,
being now invested in the sanctimonious robes of a Bishop: never rested a
moment, but either instructed the people, that flocked about him, by preaching,
or else imparted Christ unto them by Baptism, which he ministered in the open
fields and Rivers (Churches, Oratories, Fonts, or places of Baptism being not
as yet builded) it is said that in the River of Swale in Yorkshire, Bedal

he christened in one day above ten thousand men, besides women and little

ancient English. Camd. in Ric^.
He won miraculously Edwin, king of Northumberland, unto Christ: who with all
the Nobility of his country, and most part of the Commons having received the
true faith, came to the lauatorie of holy regeneration, the eleventh year of
his reign, which was the year of our Lord, 627. Thus Paulinus continued in
the Province of York, B^l. l. 2. c. 2
preaching the word, and administering the blessed Sacraments, the space of
seven years, even until the death of King Edwin; presently upon which, the
State of his kingdom was so much infested with great slaughter, and cruel
persecution; that no safety could therein be found, either for himself, or
for the widow of King Edwin, Queen Edelburgh (both of them being Gods
instruments for the conversion of the Northumbrians to the embracement of
Christian Religion) save only by flight. Whereupon he was constrained to leave
his Bishopric, and to accompany the said Queen (with whom not long before
he came into that country) back again into this kingdom of Kent. But of
Paulinus his first admittance to York, and his return back, thus much in old
Latin rimes.

At his return from York, this See of Rochester was vacant: and at the offer
of Archbishop Honorius, and at the request of King Edbald, he took upon him
that charge, which he right wisely and religiously governed the space of
thirteen years; until, at his full and ripe age, he was called away by
death, to receive the glorious reward of his blessed labors. Which happened
October. the tenth, Ann. 644.19. years 2. months, and 21. days, after his
first consecration: This Paulinus (the third Bishop of this Diocese) was first
interred under a very seemly Monument, in the old Church of King Ethelberts
foundation; but about four hundred and thirty years afterward, being
canonized for a Saint, his relics were removed, (enshrined in a coffin all of
curious wrought silver) into the body of the new built Church, by Gundulphus
one of his Successors: to the which (according to the manner of those times)
much concourse of people came, with many rich oblations: such was his Epitaph.

Ex lib. Anon. in bib Cott.

Paulinus being dead, Honorius Archbishop of Canterbury, advanced one Ithamar,
Ithamar Bishop of Rochester.
a Kentishman borne, to his place, the first Englishman of this Nation that was
a Bishop. A man nothing inferior either in life or learning to Paulinus, or
any of his Italian predecessors. He departed this life about the year 656.
Many miracles are said to be wrought by this religious Ithamar, and great
concourse of people frequented the place of his burial, which was (at the
first) in the body of the Church. But afterward his relics were removed by
Bishop Gundulph, Cap. in vit. S. Ithamari.
and enshrined; and after him by John Bishop of this Church: who by his prayers
at his Shrine was cured, ab acerrimo oculorum dolor, of a grievous pain in
his eyes. For this and many other signs and tokens of his sanctity, he was
canonized (if we may believe Capgraue) and the fourth of the Ides of June
solemnized to his memory. Of whom a late writer, thus.

Of Rochester, we have Saint Ithamar, being then

an Englishman, the ninth Bishop of this Diocese: in whose commendations
Nicholas Harpsfeld, sometime Archdeacon of Canterbury, thus writes. I will use
his own language.

about the year 726.

Here lies interred Gundulphus, Gundulph Bishop of Rochester.
a Norman by birth, the thirtieth Bishop of Rochester, a man not greatly
learned, but very wise and industrious: for he handled the matter so, as he
procured not only his Church to be new built, but also the revenues to be
increased. He recovered diverse lands and possessions encroched upon, and taken
away in former times by Odo, Earl of Kent. Godwin de prae^ul. Ang.
And besides diverse sums of money, which he contributed, he bought a
certain Manor called Heddre, and gave it to this his own Church. In all
these matters he was much helped by Lanfranke, Archbishop of Canterbury, who
caused him to take into his Church, not secular Priests, as before had been
accustomed, but Monks Benedictines. Gundulph himself being a Monk of that
order, upon his first admittance to this See, he found only six secular
Priests in the Church, who were endowed scarcely with sufficient means to live
according to their place and callings. Before his death he increased his
Church-reuenues to that height, that it did and was able to maintain fifty
Monks, some say threescore. The yearly value of this Monastery at the
suppression amounted to 486. l. 5. s. The donations to this Monastery were
confirmed by Pope Urban the second, in these words following.

When as William the Conqueror built the great white square Tower of London,
he appointed this Bishop to be principal Surueyor of that work: who was for
that time lodged in the house of one Edmere a Burgess of London: as it is in
the book of the Bishops of Rochester in these words.

Gundulphus Episcopus mandato Willelmi Regis magni presuit operi magne Turris
London, quo tempore hospitatus est apud quendam Edmerum Bargensem London.

The Hospital of Chetham.
This Bishop built a great part of the Castle of Rochester, namely, the great
Tower which yet stands. He founded an Hospital in Chetham, which he
dedicated to the honor of Saint Bartholomew, for the relief of such people as
were infected with the foul disease of the Leprosy: he endowed it with
sufficient revenues; which grant was confirmed by king Henry the third, and
discharged of all taxes, and tallages, by King Ed. the third.

Malling Abbey.
He founded the Abbey at Malling, which he consecrated to the blessed Virgin,
and placed therein black Nuns. Which Nunnery he governed himself during all
his life time. And lying at the point of death, he commended it to the charge
of one Auice, Lamb peramb.
to whom notwithstanding he would not deliver the Pastoral staff, before she
had promised canonical obedience, fidelity, and subjection to the Sea of
Rochester; and protested by oath, that there should neither Abbess nor Nun
be from thenceforth received into the house, without the consent and priuitie
of him and his Successors. This Nunnery was valued at the suppression, at two
hundred forty five pounds, ten shillings two pence halfepeny of yearly
revenue. Over the Abbey gate yet standing, is the likeness of a Pastoral
staff. This good Bishop dyed the seventh of March, 1107. and was buried where
you see the pourtraitures of certain Bishops, sometimes artificially cut in
stone and Alabaster, but now cut almost all in pieces, dismembered, and
shamefully abused (as all other Monuments in this Church are, of any antiquity)
so that neither reading, nor tradition can give us any true notice of their
names.

Gilbert de Glanuil (before mentioned) a gentleman of an ancient family,
Gilbert de Glanvill Bishop of Rochester
was consecrated to this Bishopric, September 29. Ann. 1185. Between this
man and his Monks of Rochester was long and continual debate; by occasion
whereof, he took away from them all their moveable goods, all the ornaments
of their Church, their writings and evidences, yea and a great part of their
lands, Godwin.
possessions and privileges; wanting money to follow their suites against him,
they were forced to coin the silver of Saint Paulinus Shryne into money. These
controversies were ended no otherwise then by his death, which happened, June
24. 1214. having ruled his contentious charge 29. years. But the hatred of
these Monks against him was so dying with him, as they would afford him no
manner of Obsequies, but buried him most obscurely, or rather basely, without
either ringing, singing, or any other solemnity; and furthermore abused him
with such like rime-doggerell.

Glanvill Gilbert us nulla bonitate refertus
Hic iacet immitis and amator maxim litis;
Et quia sic litem, dum vixit, solet amare,
Nunc vbi pax nulla est, est aptior inhabitare.
These black Monks (whom I think, if the matter were well examined, The
Hospital in Strowd.
would prove to be in the fouler fault) were too malicious to remember that
this Bishop founded S. Mary's Hospital at Strowd, near adjoining to this
City, called the New work, and endowed it witha liuelihood of 52. l. of
yearly profits, which it now enjoys.

Here lies entombed the body of Walter de Merton, Walterus Mer^ton Bishop of
Rochester.
so surnamed of Merton, a village in Surrey, where he was borne, sometimes Lord
Chancellor of England, Bishop of this See, and Founder of Merton College in
Oxford: To whose memory Sir Henry Savill (that rare Grecian, Sir Hen. Sauill.
and exact reuiuer of Antiquities, now deceased) late Warden of the said
College, and Provost of Eaton, with the fellows of the same, taking down an
old marble Tomb, have erected another Monument over him of Touch and
Alabaster, bearing this Inscription.

Haymo s.
Haymo de Heath, or Hythe, so named of Hithe, a Town in this tract, where he
was borne, lies buried by the North wall: he was Confessor to King Edward the
second. This man built much at his Manor houses of Troscliffe and Hawling. In
the Town of Hithe before named, he founded the Hospital of Saint Bartholomew,
S. Barthol. Hosp. in Hithe.
for relief of ten poor people, endowing the same with twenty Marks of
yearly revenue. He resigned his Bishopric into the Popes hands, of whom he
had received consecration in the Court at Rome, In bib. Cott.
Ann. 1352. and lived about some six years after that a private life with the
Monks in this Priory. This Bishop (says the book of Rochester) bought a
precious Miter which was Thomas Beckets, of the Executours of the Bishop of
Norwich, which he offered at the high Altar, on S. Paul's day, 1327.

John de Shepey Bishop of Rochester, Lord Treasurer.
John de Shepey, so likewise surnamed from the place of his birth, upon Haymo
his resignation, was by the Pope elected to this Bishopric; he was Lord
Treasurer of England, in the two and thirtieth year of King Edward the third,
in which office he continued about three years, even until his death, which
happened the nineteenth of October, 1360. His portraiture is in the wall over
his place of Burial.

Io. Low Bishop of Rochester.
Here, over against Bishop Merton, lies buried, under a fair Marble Tomb, the
body of John Low, Bishop of this Diocese, borne in Worcestershire, and
brought up in Oxford, where he proceeded Doctor of Divinity. He lived for a
time in the Abbey of the Friars Augustines in Worcester, Bale Cent. 4.
of which order he was Provincial; Vir aetate sua ab omni part doctus: So
that in regard of his great learning, and painfulnes in preaching, he was
preferred first to the Bishopric of Saint Asaph, Godwin.
by King Henry the sixth, and after that translated to this of Rochester; he
writ diverse learned works, and was a careful searcher after good books, so as
diverse copies of some ancient Fathers had utterly perished but for his
diligence. He died the year 1467. having governed the Sea of Saint Asaph
four years, and and this of Rochester four and twenty. The inscription upon
his Tomb is almost all gone, only these words remaining,...... Iohannis Low

...... miserere mei Domine.

O quam breve spatium huius mundi sicomp.....
Sic mundi gloria transit.

I do not find the certainty of any other of the Bishops of this Diocese to
have bin buried in this Cathedral Church; for most commonly in ancient times,
as now, they departed from this place, before they departed from the world,
this Ecclesiastical preferment being but a step to some higher advancement. A
word therefore or two of Saint William here enshrined, and the like of the
Priory, and so I will take my leave of this most ancient, and no less reverend
Episcopal Chair; and go to Gillingham; for the rest of the funeral
Monuments in this Church, are of later times; which I reserve for another
Volume.

This Priory erected by Gundulph, and the number of her religious Votaries,
increased by him from six secular Priests, Priory of Rochester.
to threescore black Canons or Monks, with ample revenues for their
maintenance, was, within the compass of one hundred years; what by casual
fire, what by the falling out of the Monks, and Bishop Glanvill, and what by
the calamities it sustained in the wars of King John, brought to that ruin
and poverty, that the beauty of all her goodly buildings was altogether
defaced, her Church burned, her sacred Vtensiles, by robbery and suites in law,
embezelled, misspent, and consumed, and the whole Covent greatly indebted.

It was now therefore high time, says Master Lambard, to devise some way
whereby this Priory and Church of Rochester, might be, if not altogether,
restored to the ancient wealth and estimation, yet at the least somewhat
relieved from this penury, nakedness, and abiection. Therefore Laurence of
Saint Martins, Bishop of this Church, and Counselor of King Henry the third,
perceiving the common people to be somewhat drawn (by the fraud of the
Monks) to think reverently of one William, Lamb. per amb.
that lay buried in the Church, and knowing well, that there was no one way, so
compendious to gain, as the advancement of a Pilgramage, procured at the Popes
Court, the canonization of the said William, S. William of Rochester.
with Indulgence to all such as would offer at his Tomb, underpropping by
means of this new Saint, some manner of reverend opinion of the Church, which
before (through the defacing of the old Bishop Paulinus his Shrine) was
declined to naught.

This Saint William was by birth a Scot of Perthe, Neua Legenda Capgraui^*
by trade of life a Baker of bread; in charity so abundant, that he gave to
the poor the tenth loaf of his workmanship, in zeal so fervent, that in vow
he promised, and in deed attempted to visit the holy Land, and the places where
Christ was conversant on earth. In which journey, as he passed through Kent, he
made Rochester his way, where after that he had rested two or three days, he
departed toward Canterbury, but ere he had gone far from the City, his
servant that waited on him, led him (of purpose) out of the highway, and
spoiled him both of his money and life. This done, the servant escaped, and the
Master (because he dyed in so holy a purpose of mind) was by the Monks
conveyed hither to Saint Andrews, laid in the Quire, and promoted by the Pope,
as you have heard, from a poor Baker to a blessed Martyr. Here (as they say)
he showed miracles very plentifully, which made people of all sorts offer unto
him wondrous liberally, even until these latter times; insomuch, that with two
years oblations at his Shrine, one William de Hoo, a Sacrist, or keeper of the
holy treasures, of this Church, built the whole Quire as it now stands.

Richard Walden a Monk and sacrist, Lib. Rossen, in bib. Cot.
built the South Isle, Richard Eastgate, a Monk and Sacrist, began the North
Isle of the new work, toward Saint Williams gate, which Friar William de
Axenham almost finished.

Geffery de Hadenham Prior, paid thirteen hundred pounds in one day, to
certain creditours, to whom this Church stood indebted, since the time of her
troubles, the same man bought certain lands in Banerkin, and Darent, which he
gave to this House; and bequeathed to the same 300. l. in money upon his
decease. He built the Dorter in the Priory, and the Altar of Saint Edmund in
the Church. To which, or rather to the high Altar, Haymo, Bishop of this
Diocese, offered up a precious Miter, which sometime belonged to Archbishop
Becket, and which he bought of the Executours of John Bishop of Norwich. Thus
by the gains of William, the Bakers Shrine, and by the pious endeauours and
bounteous donations of diverse well disposed persons, this Monastery was in
short time reedified, adorned, and advanced to her former height, glory,
wealth, and estimation. So that it was valued by the Commissioners of the late
suppression, at four hundred eighty six pounds, eleven shillings, five
pence, by year.

In this Church are diverse fair Monuments fairly kept, of the Beaufits, an
ancient family, whose chief seat was at Grauch-court within this Parish, as I
was informed.

Here lies Ioane Bamme, sometime the wife of Master Richard Bamme Esquire,
daughter of John Marten, sometime chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and
mother of John Bamme, who lies on the North side of this Chapel. Which said
Ioane deceased in the year of grace, 1431. Here was a pilgrimage to our Lady
of Gillingham.

Ailesford.
The ^^iery.
Richard, Lord Gray of Codnor in Darbishire, in the year 1240. founded here a
religious house of white Friars, Carmelites, where now is seen (says Camden)
the fair habitation of Sir William Sidley, Com. in ^en^.
a learned knight, painefully and expensfully studious of the common good of
his country, as both his endowed house for the poor, The Almeshouse o^
Hospital.
and the bridge here with the common voice dotestifie.

Not far from this Town of Ailesford, lie interred the bodies of Catigern
and Horsa; Catigern and Horsa.
who hand to hand, killed one the other in a set battle; Catigern was the
brother of Vortimer king of the Britains, and Horsa brother of Hengist the
Saxon.

But this battle, as also their burial, are the best set down by Camden, out
of Lambards perambulation. This Town (says he) was named in the British
tongue, Saissenaeg haibail of the Saxons there vanquished, like as others in
the very same sense termed it Anglesford. For Guortimer the Britain, The
battle of Ailesford.
Guortigerus son, did here set upon Hengist, and the English Saxons, whom
being disrayed, and not able to abide a second charge, he put all to flight; so
as they had been utterly defeited for ever, but that Hengist, skillful and
provident to prevent, and divert danger, withdrew himself into the Isle of
Tenet, until that the invincible vigor and heat of the Britanes was allayed,
and fresh supplies came to his succor out of Germany. In this battle were
slain the Generals of both sides, Catigern the Britain, and Horsa the Saxon,
of whom the one buried at Horsted, Horsted.
not far from hence, gave name to the place: and Catigern honored with a
stately and solemn funeral, is thought to have been interred near unto
Ailisford, where under the side of an hill, Catigern his sepulcher.
I saw four huge, rude, hard stones erected, two for the sides, one
transuersall in the midst between them; and the hugest of all piled and
laid over them, in manner of the British Monument, which is called Stonehenge,
but not so artificially with Mortis and tenants. Verily the unskillful common
people call it at this day, of the same Catigern, Keiths or Kits, Coty house.
The like Monument was of Horsa at Horsted, which storms and time have now
devoured. This battle was smitten in the year of Grace 457.

he) one hundred Burgesses of the City of Canterbury, ought their suite to the
Manor of Norwood; the buildings are now demolished: but the Manor was long
time in the possession of certain gentlemen of the same name: of which race,
one was buried in the body of the Church at Addington, in the year 1416.

Otteham.

I find by ancient deeds sans Date that one Raph de Dene was the founder of a
Religious house here at Otteham, Otteham Abbey
of Canons regular, confirmed in these words by the gifts of certain lands
from one Raph de Iclesham: and some little rent, William de Marci, and Ela his
wife.

But these Canons did not continue long at Otteham, the situation of the place
being unfitting, and very chargeable for so many living together in a Covent;
whereupon by the said Ela, daughter and heir of the said Raph Dene, and as
then the widow of Jordan de Sackvile (one of the Ancestors of that right
honorable and no less ancient family of the Sackviles, Earls of Dorset) they
were removed to Begam, a village in the South-west Verge of this County
adjoining to Sussex: such was the Charter for their remouall.

Begham Priory. Ela de Sackvile and Sir Robert Turnham founders.
The land whereupon this house was built, was given by one Sir Robert de
Turnham, a valiant knight, who flourished in the reign of king Richard the
first, and went with him to the wars in the holy Land; as these old rimes do
testify.

Rob. Glocest.
King Richard with good intent

his Fauchion
Began to crake many a croun.
But he was so busy in cracking the Sarasins Crowns, The death of Sir Robert
Turnham.
that he took the less heed (I think) of his own, for then and there he
was slain, together with Robert de Bellemont, surnamed Blanchmaines, Earl of
Leicester, with other noble warriors: whose great loss king Richard does thus
lament.

Alas he said yat I was bore, Rob. Glo^.

did dedicate it to the honor of the blessed Virgin Mary, and gave it the name
of a Priory, which was valued at the suppression to 152. l. 19. s. 4. d. ob.

Sir Thomas Sackuile knight, Sir Tho. Sackvile knight,
son and heir of Sir Andrew Sackuile, by his second wife Ioane Burgese, who
was Sheriff of Sussex, and Surrey, the eight of King Henry the fourth, was
here interred in the Church of Beigham; as appears by these words in his last
Will, dated the first of December, 1432. In the prerogative office.
Ego Tho. Sakevile miles de Com. Sussex, volo me sepultum esse in Ecclesia de
Beigeham. Item lego Edwardo ^ilio meo omnia vtensilia domus me, etc. He dyed
in the same year, the eleventh of King Henry the sixth.

Here sometime, in our Ladies Chapel, lay interred the body of Richard
Sackevile Esquire, who dyed Ann. 1524.

This Church was, and that of Withiam in Sussex now is, greatly honored by the
funeral Monuments of the Sackviles: of whom I shall have more occasion to
speak hereafter.

Pensherst.
Here in this Church under a marble Monument, Sir Stephen Pensherst knight.
whereon is yet to be seen the pourtraiture of a knight completely armed,
lies interred (as it is delivered unto me by tradition) the body of Sir
Stephen Pensherst, or Stephen de Penchester, (for so also I find him called)
that famous Lord Warden of the Five Ports, who flourished in the reign of King
Edward the first, as appears by this Record following.

Here lie also interred diverse of that ancient and highly renowned Family of
the Sidneys, Sidney*
whose Monuments of any great antiquity, together with their Inscriptions, are
worn away with time. Who derive their race from William de Sidney,
Chamberlain to king Henry the second. Out of which came (says Camden) Sir
Henry Sidney, ^amd in Ken^.
that renowned Lord Deputy of Ireland, who of the daughter of John Dudley, Duke
of Northumberland, and Earl of Warwick, ^
begat Philip and Robert, whom our late Sovereign Lord King James created
Baron Sidney of Penshert, Viscount Lisle, and Earl of Leicester. And to give
more luster to these foresaid honors, he was elected knight and companion of
the honorable Order of the Garter, at an extraordinary Chapter holden at
Greenwich, the day of May, Ann. 1616. and enstalled at Windsor the seventh of
July next following. This Earl dyed the day of.... Ann.

Sir Philip Sidney knight.
But here I cannot pass over in silence Sir Philip Sidney the elder brother,
being (to use Camdens words) the glorious star of this family, a lively
pattern of virtue, and the lovely joy of all the learned sort, fighting
valiantly with the enemy before Zutphen in Gelderland, dyed manfully. This is
that Sidney, whom, as Gods will was, he should be therefore borne into the
world, even to show unto our age a sample of ancient virtues: so his good
pleasure was, before any man looked for it, to call for him again, and take
him out of the world, as being more worthy of heaven then earth. Thus we may
see, perfect virtue suddenly vanishes out of sight, and the best men continue
not long.

Seigneur Des Accords in his book entitled, Les Bigarrures (a miscellanie or
hotch-potch of sundry collections) amongst many choice Epitaphs, has one,
selected out of the works of Isaac du Bellay, the French Poet, excellently
composed, to the memory of Sieur de Boniuet, a great Commander in the wars;
which by some English wit was happily imitated, and ingeniously applied to the
honor of this our worthy chiefetaine Sir Philip; written upon a Tablet, and
fastened to a pillar in S. Paul's Church London, the place of his burial, as
the sequel will more plainly show.

The Epitaph for Mons. Boniuet:
La France, et le Piemont, les cieux, et les Arts,
Les Soldats, et le Mondeont fait comme six parts,
De ce grand Bonniuet: cor vne si grand chose,
Dedant un seul tombeau ne pouuoit estre enclose.
La France en a le corpse, que elle aurit esleue:
Le Piemont a le ceur, qu'il auoit esprouue:
Les cieux en ont l'esprit, et les Arts la memoire,
Les Soldats le regret, et le monde la gloire.
In English as follows.

France, and Piemont, the Heavens, and the Arts,
The Soldiers and the world have made six parts,
Of Great Bonniuet: for who will suppose,
That only one Tomb can this man enclose?
France has his body, which she bred and well loved,
Piemont his heart, which his valor had proved.
The Heavens have his soul, the Arts have his Fame,
The Soldiers the grief, the world his good name.
A brief Epitaph upon the death of that most valiant, and perfect honorable
Gentleman, Sir Philip Sidney, knight, late Governor of Flushing in Zealand,
who received his deaths wound at a battle near Zutphen in Gelderland, the 22.
day of September, and dyed at Arnhem the 16. day of October, 86. Whose
Funerals were performed, and his body interred, within this Cathedral Church
of Saint Paul in London, the 16. day of February next following in the year of
our Lord God, 1586.

England, ^.
Netherland, the Heavens, and the Arts,
The Soldiers and the world have made six parts,
Of noble Sidney: For who will suppose,
That a small heap of stones can Sidney enclose?
England has his body, for she it fed,
Netherland his blood in her defense shed:
The Heavens have his soul, the Arts have his Fame,
The Soldiers the grief, the world his good Name.
These Elegies also following, penned in the praise of the said Philip, by our
late Sovereign Lord King James, that sole Monarch of many Nations, give a
glorious luster to his Heroicke actions.

In Philippi Sidnaei interitum, Illustrissimi Scotorum Regis Carmen.
Armipotens cui ius in fortia pectora Mauors,
Tu Dea quae cerebrum perrumpere digna Tonantis,
Tuque adeo biiugae proles Latonia r^pis

Heu frustra queror: heu rapuit Mors omnia secum*
Et nihil ex tanto nunc est Hero superstes,

The same translated by the said King.

Thou mighty Mars, the Lord of Soldiers brave,
And thou Minerve, that dois in wit excel,
And thou Apollo, who dois knowledge have
Of every art that from Parnassus fell.
With all your Sisters that thaire on do dwell,
Lament for him, who duly served you all:
Whom in you wisely all your arts did mell,
Bewail (I say) his unexpected fall.
I need not in remembrance for to call
His race, his youth, the hope had of him ay,
Since that in him does cruel Death appall
Both manhood, wit, and learning every way:
But yet he does in bed of Honor rest,
And evermore of him shall live the best.

In English.

When Venus sad saw Philip Sidney slain,
She wept, supposing Mars that he had bin:
From fingers Rings, and from her neck the chain
She plucked away, as if Mars nere again
She meant to please. In that form he was in

What had he done, if he had lived this while?
Tunbridge.
In this ruinous Church, which (like the Ca^tle) carries with it a show of
venerable antiquity, I find no funeral Monument of elder times remarkable;
in the north window only are depicted the pourtraitures of the Lord Hugh
Stafford, kneeling in his coate-armour, and his Bow-bearer Thomas Bradlaine by
him, with this inscription.

The said Raph de Stafford and Margaret his wife, Raph Earl of Stafford, and

Raph, by the marriage of his wife Margaret, writ himself in his Charters and

The foundation of the School and Almeshouse in Sennock. Lamb. Peramb.
About the latter end of the reign of king Edward the third (to use M. Lambards
words) there was found, lying in the streets of Sennocke, a poor child, whose
parents were unknown, and he for the same cause named after the place where he
was taken up, William Sennock. This orphan was, by the help of some charitable
persons, brought up and nourtured in such wise, that being made an Apprentice
to a Grocer in London, he arose by degrees, in course of time, to be Mayor,
and chief Magistrate of that City.

At which time, calling to his mind the goodness of Almighty God, and the
favor of the Townsmen extended toward him, he determined to make an
everlasting Monument of his thankful mind for the same; and therefore in the
year 1418. the year of his Maioroialtie, he builded both an Hospital for
relief of the poor; and a free-Schoole for the education of youth within this
Town, endowing both the one and the other with competent yearly living (as
the days then suffered) toward their sustentation and maintenance. But since
his time the School was much amended by the liberality of one John Potkyn,
which lived under the reign of king Henry the eighth, and now lately also in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth of famous memory, through the honest travel of
diverse Towne-inhabitants; not only the yearly stipend is much increased, and
the former litigious possessions quietly established, but the Corporation also
changed into the name of two Wardeins, and four Assistants of the free-Schoole
of Queen Elizabeth in Sennocke.

bestowed upon him this Bishopric of Rochester; he being before a Benedictine
Monk of Norwich. He was Confessor unto king Ric. the second; and a singular
Benefactour he was to the English Hospital at Rome. He dyed as before, Ann.

Martin Peckha^ and Margerie his wife.
Here are two tombs in the Churchyard, and near to the Churchdoore, the one
of which (says Francis Thin Lancaster Herald) was erected to the memory of
Martin Peckham Esquire: the other to Margerie Peckham his wife; by the marriage
of which Margerie ample revenues came to the family of the Peckhams, she being
daughter and heir to Yaldham, Lord of the Manor of Yaldham. Glouer Somerset
Herald in his Collections says, that John Peckham did hold the Manor of
West-Peckham, in the first of Henry the third. But certain it is that John
Peckham Archbishop of Canterbury, in the reign of Edward the first, was the
first man that advanced his name to those great possessions, which his
posterity enjoyed even till these our times.

to be made for Sir Richard Hawte, Hawte:
sometime owner and founder of the Mote, and Lieutenant of the Tower of London.
Some say to Sir Nicholas, some one knight of that name, some another: for an
ancient family they were of knights degree, Glouer. Somerset.
and Lords of many fair Manors; all which (by the marriage of Jane and
Elizabeth, daughters and coheires of Sir William Hawte knight, by Mary his
wife, the daughter of Sir Richard Guilfora knight) came to be the inheritance
of Sir Thomas Wiat, and Sir Tho. Culpepper: yet some more judicious say, that
this Monument was erected for one Cawne, who was likewise owner of the Mote,
who married with Morrant Lord of Morrants Court.

Cobham.
In this Church are many fair Monuments foully defaced, under which the
Cobhams, and Brooks, Lords and Barons of this Town of Cobham, with many of
their kindred, Allies and progeny lie interred; who for many descents did
flourish in honorable reputation, even until these our times.

To make this maimed inscription more perfectly to be understood, let me tell

This John Lord Cobham was the builder of Cowling Castle, and the founder of
this College: Cobham College.
valued at the suppression, at one hundred eight and twenty pounds, ten
shillings nine pence, half penny, by the year. He was the last Lord Cobham of
that surname; for he left but one only daughter, wife to Sir John de la Pole
knight. And she likewise (howsoever she had many husbands) (of which number
Sir John Oldcastle was one) had not any issue, Sir John Oldcastle knight Lord
Cobham.
but only by Sir Reygnold Braybroke, who dyed all young, excepting one
daughter called Ioane; who married with Thomas Brook of Somersetshire, to whom
she brought both her mothers inheritance and honor; which these Brooks did
happily enjoy for the space of six descents, being ever employed in offices of
State, and matters of high consequence. Yet always standing firm, both in the
favor of the Prince, and his people, until the last of these Lords, stumbling
upon a shallow-pated Treason, which was laid in his way; fell down to the
ground, together with his house, his inheritance, and all his additions of
honor. But to return to the rest of the Epitaphs.

Such was the politic devotion of religious houses in those days, thus
publicly to remember, and pray for the souls of all their Benefactours:
thereby to incite others to the like works of charity, by which they still
increased their Founders first endowments.

Shorn.
Near to the high Altar of this Church, is a very fair Monument for Sir Henry
de Cobham knight, Lord of Roundall, a Manor within this Parish; where now
scarce the ruins appear, ^.
to direct one where the house stood. He is buried crosselegged, with his
coat-armes on his robe, about whose Tomb in an old Character thus much may be
read.

The Lieger book of Feuersham makes mention of one Henry Lord Cobham, who lived
in great honor in the reigns of Edward the first, and Edward the second:
these are the words, but I think this is not the man which lies here entombed.

Pe^shu^st Lord Warden. Ioane and Alice his daughters and heirs. Ioane ma^ned
to the said H. Lord Cobham. Alice to Philip de Columbars.

This Church in times past was much haunted by a mad company of Pilgrims, who
came hither for Saint Hildeferths help (a Bishop by conjecture of his picture,
yet standing in the upper window of the South Isle) to whom such as were
distracted ran for restitution of their wits. Which cure was performed by
warmth, close keeping, and strict diet. A cure no more miraculous (says
Lambard) then is, at this day, the keepers of Bedlem.

The Priory of Dartford.
King Edward the third founded here a goodly fair Monastery, about the year of
his reign of England, the thirtieth, and of France the seventeenth: In which
he placed women, religious Votaries, or white Nuns. Which Nunnery at the
general dissolution, was found to be well worth three hundred and eighty
pounds by year. This Priory (for so it was called by the Founder) was taken
(as all the rest) into the hands of king Henry the eight: of which he made a
fit dwelling place for himself, and his Successors, which remains to this
day, howsoever somewhat ruinous. But will it please you peruse this Memorandum,
not impertinent to this matter, in the visitation of Kent, and Sussex, made by
Clarentieux Beuolt, the 21. year of king Henry the eight, Dame Elizabeth
Cresner being Lady Prioresse of Dartford at that time.

Memorand. Burials in this Prio^y.
that the said Lady does witness, that king Edward the third was first Founder
of the said place: and the second Founder was king Richard the second. And in
the said place lies buried the Lady Bridget, daughter to king Edward the
fourth, a religious women in the same place. Also Dame Ioane, daughter to the
Lord Scrope of Bolton, and Prioresse of the same place: and Dame Margaret
daughter of the Lord Beaumont, also sometime Prioresse of the same place. And
also there lies daughter and wife to Sir Maurice Berkeley.

This Lady Bridget here interred, The birth and death of Bridget Plantagine^.
was the fourth daughter of Edward the fourth, by his wife Queen Elizabeth,
she was borne at Eltham, here by, the tenth of November, 1480. She took the
habit of Religion when she was young, and so spent her life in contemplation
unto the day of her death: which happened about the year 1517. the eight of
King Henry the eight.

Lesnes Abbey.
Matthew Paris.
In the year of our Lord 1178. the third of the Ides of June, Richard Lucie a
Counselor of State, and chief Justice of the Realm, began the foundation of
an Abbey, Ric. de Lucie the founder.
at Lesnes or Westwood, near unto this Town of E^^th The extent of whose
yearly revenue (as it was prized by the Commissioners at the suppression)
amounted to one hundred eighty six pounds and nine shillings. When this his
goodly fabric was in all parts finished, he presently forsook and surrendered
into the kings hands, R^g Heu^den. An. 1179.
all both his offices and honors; And betook himself to the habit and
profession of a Canon Regular in this house of his own foundation; where,
within a short while after, even in the same year, to wit, the fourteenth of
July, 1479. he exchanged his Conuentuall black cool, for a glorious bright
heavenly crown.

And here in the Quire of his Church he was sumptuously entombed, upon whose
Monument this Epitaph was engraven.

Now give me leave to go a little further with him and his heirs, as I find
the words in the Collection of Englands Protectours, by Francis Thin
Lancaster Herald.

Sir Richard Lucie knight, chief Justice of England (says he) was Protector
of England in the twelfth year of the reign of king Henry the second, in the
absence of the king, when he was in Normandy, and in the parts beyond the
Seas. Which Lucie in the thirteenth year of the same King, did valiantly
resist, and politikely drive back the Earl of Bolloigne, inuading this
kingdom. He built the Abbey of Leosnes or Westwood in the Parish of Erith in
Kent (and not in Southfleet as some have written) in the year of Christ, 1178.
and the Castle of Chipping Augre in Essex. He had issue Godfrey, Bishop of
Winchester, and three daughters; who, after the death of Godfrey their brother,
were his heirs* Maude the eldest daughter was married to Robert the first,
called Fitzwater. Aueline the second daughter was married to Richard Rivers of
Stanford Rivers in Essex. Rose the third daughter was married to Richard de
Warren, the natural son of king John: as appears by a deed (belonging to
my self, who had the Rectory of Leosnes) beginning thus. Rosa de Dover quondam

The foresaid Godfrey de Lucy was consecrated Bishop of Winchester, Godfrey
Lucy Bishop of Winchester.
the first of November 1189. And died Ann. 1204 having governed that See
fifteen years. He purchased of king Richard the first, the Manors of
Wergraue, and Menes, which in times past had belonged to his Bishopric: he
was a great Benefactour to this Religious house of Leosnes, founded by his
father; wherein according to his will he was enterred. To whose memory this
Epitaph was engraven upon his Tomb.

The Priory of Lewsham.
John Norbury founded a Priory in this Town of Lewsham, which he replenished
with black Monks Aliens, belonging to the Abbey of Gaunt in Flanders, Priors
Aliens.
and thereupon called Aliens, because they were Celles to some Monastery or
other beyond the Seas. The first foundation of these houses I do not find; but
in the reign of king Edward the third, they were increased to the number of
one hundred and ten in England, besides them in Ireland, Their goods and lands

own use, letting out their houses to farm, with all their lands and
tenements, for the space of three and twenty years. At the end of which Term
(Peace being concluded between the two Nations) he restored to the Priors
Aliens their houses, lands, and tenements, Ann. Reg. 35. as by his patents may
appear in effect as follows.

us, and the noble Prince, our most dear brother the king of France, we, for
the honor of God, and holy Church, restore to the said Prior, the Priory with
all the lands, tenements, fees, aduowsons, and whatsoever else belonging to the
same, to hold the same in as free manner as they held it before. And withal,
forgive and release all arrerages of Rents, which might be due unto us by
reason of any former grants. In witness, etc. the sixth of February, the 35.

Greenwich.
This Parish Church is consecrated to the honor of Saint Aelphege, Aelphege
Archbishop of Canterbury.
sometime Archbishop of Canterbury, who suffered martyrdom much-what about the
same place where it now stands. Which Aelp^ege (bo^ne of great parentage,
brought up in good learning, preferred first to the Bishopric of Winchester,
then to this of Canterbury; a man admired for his strict manner of life, and
holy exhortations, by both which he con^uerted many unto Christ) was cruelly
put to death by the Danish Pagans, with many exquisite torments, in the year
of our Lord, a thousand and twelve. Of which, in William Malmesbury, Camden,
and the Catalogue of Bishops, you may read more at large. It was long before
these bloody executioners would suffer his body to be committed to the earth,
after the manner of Christian decency; yet at length that favor was obtained,
and his body here first buried; from whence within a short time after, his
relics were removed to Saint Paul's London, and from thence (at the
commandment of king Knute) to Canterbury. He was canonized; and the 19. day of
April allowed for celebration of his memory.

Some write, Ca^graut in vita Elphege. Ditma^. Mar^^^ (...).
that like another Stephen, he was stoned to death, that like him he prayed for
his enemies; and that Turkill (general of those Danes) was converted to the
faith, at the sight of his constant martyrdom.

Here sometime stood an house of obseruant Friars, The Friery a^ Greenwich.
which came hither about the latter end of the reign of King Edward the
fourth, at whose hands they obtained a Chantrie, with a little Chapel of the
holy Cross, a place yet extant in the Town; Lamb. peramb.
and king Henry the seventh builded for them an house adjoining to the Palace,
which is there yet to be seen.

Here in this Town was another Monastery of Friars Minorites, The Priory.
and Aliens, founded by King Edward the third, and the foresaid John Norbury:
which as Lewsham did, belonged to the Abbot of Gaunt in Flaunders, until such
time as King Henry the fifth (seizing into his hands (by occasion of war) all
the lands of the Priors Aliens) (as I have touched before) bestowed this,
together with the Manor of Lewsham, and many other lands also, upon the Priory
of Chartrehouse Monks of Shene, which he had then newly erected; to which it
remained, until the time of the reign of king Henry the eight, who annexed it
to the Crown.

Martin the fifth Bishop of Rome, granted by this Bull to these Staple
Merchants, in this Weeuers Maioralty at their earnest request, an itinerarie or
portable Altar, which they were to take with them to what place soever they
traveled to make any time of abode; and withal gave them license to elect a
Priest, to say Mass, administer the Sacraments, to hear their confessions, to
enjoin them penance, and to give them absolution as the cause should require.
The form of which I hold it not much amiss here to set down, as I found it
in an old Manuscript, without name or date, in the Earl of Exceters Library.

Martinus Episcopus Seruus Seruorum Dei, dilectis filijs Maiori et eius locum

By another Bull dated the same year, and his Apostolical authority, he
gives them free election of their Confessor the Priest. Their Priest and
Confessor.
The words are; Aliquem ydoneum et discretum presbyterum eligere confessorem
indulgemus, qui quotiens vobis fuerit oportunum confessionibus vestris
diligenter auditis, pro commissis debitam vobis absolutionem impendat et
iniungat penitentiam salutarem; nisi forsan talia fuerint, etc. propter que
seeds Apostolica, etc. Nulli ergo omnino hominum, etc. Dat. etc. In English.

We favorably yield to your devout and pious supplications, and we give you
leave to choose a sufficient and discreet Priest for your Confessor; who so
often, as to you it shall be thought convenient, your confessions being
attentively heard, may give to each of you due absolution for your
delinquencies committed, And appoint you saving and comfortable penance:
unless the offenses be of that nature, for which the Apostolical chair is to
be sought to for remission.

Therefore let it not be lawful for any man, in any wise, to infringe, or in a
kind of foole-hardinesse rashly to contradict this Cartulary of our Concession:
which indeed if any one presume to attempt, let him know for certain, that he
shall incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of his blessed Apostles
Peter and Paul. Given, etc.

Then follows a form of Absolution, made in the Apostolical Consistory with
plenary Indulgence to be pronounced by the Priest, to any one of these
Merchants whenever they shall be dangerously sick, in these words,

Ego authoritate Dei omnipotentis and beatorum Petri et Pauli Apostolorum eius,
The form of an Absolution.
et Domini nostri Martini Pape Quinti mihi in hac part specialiter commissa,
secundum quod potestas mihi tradita se extendit, et quantum debeo et possum si
ista vice moriaris te absolvo ab omnibus penis Purgatorii, que tibi in
Purgatorio debentur propter culpas et offensas quas contra Deum commisisti; et
te restituo illi innocentie in qua eras tempore quo baptizatus fuisti. In
nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus sancti. Amen.

I by the authority of Almighty God, and of his blessed Apostles Peter and
Paul, and of our Lord and Master Martin the fifth Pope, to me especially
committed in this behalf, according, and in so much as the power to me given
will extend it self, and how much of duty I owe, and how much I may or can; I
absolve thee from all the pains of Purgatory which are due to be inflicted
upon thee in Purgatory, for those sins and offenses which thou have committed
against God; and I restore thee to that innocence in which thou liuedst, the
same day, when thou had newly received Baptism. In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

A word or two of these two words Merchant Staple, or Staple Merchant.

He is properly called a Merchant, qui mare traijcit, The definition of a
Merchant
who passes over the Seas, et merces inde avehit, and from thence transports
merchandise or wares into his own warehouse; either bought for ready money, or
had in exchange for other commodities which he brings with him out of his own
Country. The diligence and industry of these Merchants is accuratly expressed
by Horace, Epist. lib. 1. Ep. 1.

Impiger extremos curret Mercator ad Indos
Per mare pauperiem fugiens, per saxa, per ignes.
The ready Merchant runs to the utmost Inde with speed.
By Sea, by rocks, by fire, to shun outrageous need.
There are a company of notable Skanderouns which greatly desire to be styled
Merchants, and these are such as run from house to house, from Market to
Market, What Pedlers are.
such as haunt Faires and all public meetings; with packs and Fardels upon
their backs, filled with counterfeit and adulterate wares, with which they
cheat, deceive, and cousin the poor countrey-people: and these are called
Pedlers, Quod pedes iter conficiunt: because they go on foot.

Stapula inquit (Lud. Guiccia, est locus publicus quo principis auctoritate et
priuilegio, Staple whar.
lanae, vina, coria, frumenta, aliaeque merces exotica vendendi causa
conuchuntur. Staple is a public place (says Lud. Guiccia) to which by the
Prince his authority and privilege, wool, wine, Hides of beasts, corn or
grain, and other exoticke or foreign merchandise are transferred, carried, or
conveyed there to be sold, or set to sale. Or,

Staple signifies this or that Town or City, whither the Merchants of
England, by common order or commandment, did carry their woolls, wooll-fels,
clothes, lead, and Tin, and such like commodities of our Land, for the
utterance of them by the great.

The word (says Mins. let. 5.) may probably be taken two ways, one from
Stapel, which in the Saxon or old English language, signifies the stay or hold
of any thing. Or from the French word Estape, id est, forum Vinarium: because
to those places, whither our English Merchants brought their commodities, the
French would also meet them with theirs, which most of all consists in wines.

Now, howsoever we most commonly find the Staple to be kept, and thereupon,
as in this place, the Merchants thereof were styled, Mercatores Stapulae villae
Calistiae, yet you may read of many other places appointed for the Staple in
the Statutes of the Land, according as the Prince by his counsel thought good
to alter them from the second year of Edward the third, cap 9. to the fifth of
Edward the sixth.

Officers belonging to these Staples, were Majors, Constables, Manipernors,
correctours, Porters, packers, winders, workers, and other laborers of woolls.

The Fees of the Majors and Constables of the Staples in England, levied out of
4. d. a Sack of wool, coming to every Staple, were as follows. The Mayor
of the Staple of Westminster had yearly, one hundred pounds, and every of the
Constables there ten marks. The Majors of the Staples of York, Kingstone upon
Hull, Norwich, and Winchester, every of them twenty pounds, and every of the
Constables of the same places one hundred shillings. The Majors of Newcastle
upon Tine, Chichester, and of Exceter, ten pounds; and every of the Constables
of those places five marks. And if any of the Majors and Constables above
named, refused the Office, he was to pay to the company as much as his Fee
should amount to. Of all which you may read the Statute, Ann. 27. Ed. 3.

The Mayor and Constables of the Staple had power to record Recognisances of
debt taken before them, by virtue of a Statute, made the tenth of Henry the
sixth.

Chetham.
And here give me leave (courteous Reader) to turn back to this Church situate
near Rochester, only to set down a strange burial in this Churchyard, thus
related by Lambard in his perambulation of Kent.

Although (says he) I have not hitherto, at any time, read any memorable
thing recorded in History, touching Chetham it self, yet, for so much as I
have often heard (and that constantly reported) a Popish illusion done at that
place; and for that also it is as profitable to the keeping under of fained and
superstitious religion, to renew to mind the Priestly practices of old time
(which are declining to oblivion) as it is pleasant to retain in memory the
monuments and Antiquities of whatsoever of other kind: I think it not amiss,
to commit faithfully to writing, what I have received credibly by hearing,
concerning the Idols, sometime known by the names of our Lady, and the Roode
of Chetham and Gillingham. It happened (say they) that the dead corpse of a man
(lost through shipwreck belike) was cast on land in the Parish of Chetham, and
being there taken up, was by some charitable persons committed to honest
burial within their Churchyard: which thing was no sooner done, but our Lady
of Chetham finding her self offended therewith, arose by night, and went in
person to the house of the Parish-Clerk (which then was in the street, a good
distance from the Church) and making a noise at his window, awaked him. This
man at the first (as commonly it fares with men disturbed in their rest)
demanded, somewhat roughly, who was there: But when he understood by her own
answer, that it was the Lady of Chetham, he changed his note, and most mildly
asked the cause of her coming. She told him, that there was lately buried
near to the place where she was honored, a sinful person, which so offended
her eye with his ghastly grinning, that, unless he were removed, she could not,
but (to the great grief of good people) withdraw her self from that place,
and cease her wonted miraculous working in that place amongst them. And
therefore she willed him to go with her, to the end that (by his help) she
might take him up and cast him again into the River. The Clerk obeyed, arose
and waited on her toward the Church: but the good Lady (not wonted to walk)
waxed weary of the labor, and therefore was enforced, for very want of breath,
to sit down in a bush by the way, and there to rest her. And this place
(forsooth) as also the whole track of their journey (remaining ever after a
green path) the Towne-dwellers were wont to show. Now after a while, they go
forward again, and coming to the Churchyard, dug up the body, and conveyed
it to the waters side, where it was first found.

This done, our Lady shranke again into her Shrine, and the Clerk packed home
to patch up his broken sleep, but the corpse now eftsoons floated up and down
the River, as it did before. Which thing being at length espied by them of
Gillingham, it was once more taken up and buried in their Churchyard. But see
what followed upon it, not only the Roode of Gillingham (say they) that a
while before was busy in bestowing miracles, was now deprived of all that his
former virtue: but also the very earth and place, where this carcass was laid,
did continually for ever after settle and sink downward.

This tale received by tradition (says my foresaid Author) from the Elders,
was long since both commonly reported, and faithfully credited of the vulgar
sort, which although happily you shall not at this day learn at every man's mouth
(the Image being now many years sithence defaced) yet many of the aged number
remember it well, and in the time of darkness, Haec erat in toto notissima
fabula mundo.


Otford.
Burialls at Otford.
The fields about this Village are filled with the dead bodies of many brave
Soldiers, here slain in two famous set battles: whereof the one happened
amongst the Saxons themselves, contending for glory and supreme Sovereignty.
The other between the Danes and Saxons, striving for lands, lives, and
liberty. In the first Offa the king of Mercia (having already joined to his
Dominion the most part of Westsex, and Northumberland, and seeking to have
added Kent also) prevailed against the Inhabitants of this country, not
without great slaughter of his own subjects. Alrick the king of Kent was here
slain by the hands of Offa himself. Whose overthrow was the less
dishonorable, for that he had the courage to withstand in single opposition,
Alrick king of Kent.
so puissant and impugnable an enemy. This Alrick was the last Kentish king
that held the Scepter in a lineall succession; the rest that followed, both got
and enjoyed it by tyranny and usurpation. He is said to have reigned 34.
years; and to have been thus vanquished in the year of Grace, 793. The place
of his burial, whether here with his discom^ited soldiers, or at Canterbury
with his royal Ancestors, is to me uncertain.

In the second battle, Edmund the Monarch of the Englishmen (surnamed for his
great strength Ironside) obtained against Canutus the Dane, a most honorable
victory, committing upon the Danes such slaughter, and bloody havoc, that if
they had not better trusted to their heels then to their hands (flying toward
the Isle of Shepey) he had that day made an end of the whole Danish army: and
by all likelihood the wars had ceased betwixt those two Nations for ever. In
this battle Canute lost four thousand and five hundred men; and king Edmund
only six hundred. It was fought in the year, 1016.

Bartilmew the Saint at Otf^rd and his offering.
One Bartilmew (says Lambard) a Saint, was holden in great veneration at this
Town of Otford. His feast day was kept solemnly here, both with a fair and
good fare, ever upon Saint Bartholomewes day: he was much frequented (by the
Parishioners and neighbors about) for a most rare and singular property that
he professed. For the manner was, that if any woman (conceived with child)
desired to bring forth a male, she should offer to Saint Bartilmew a
cocke-chicken: and if her wish were to be delivered of a female, she should
then present him with a Hen. This Saint questionless was a good Purueyor of
Poultrie for the Parson of the Town.

Saint Thomas Becket likewise was holden in great esteem and worship at this
Town; for it was said of the Inhabitants long since, and may be as yet
(perhaps) by some of them believed, that while Thomas Becket lay at the old
House here at Otford (which of long time belonged to the Archbishops of
Canterbury, A part of Saint Tho Beckets (...).
and whereof some part is as yet remaining) and say that it wanted a fit spring
to water it: that he struck his staff into the dry ground (in a place thereof
at this day called Saint Thomas Well) and that immediately water appeared; the
which running plentifully serves the Offices of the new House at this present
time.

They say also that as he walked on a time in the old Park (busy at his
prayers) that he was much hindered in his devotion, by the sweet note and
melody of a Nightingale, that sang in a Bush besides him, and that therefore
(in the might of his holiness) he enjoined that from thenceforth no bird of
that kind should be so bold as to sing thereabouts. Some men report likewise,
that for as much as a Smith (then dwelling in the Town) had pricked his horse
in the shooting; he enacted by like authority, that after that time no Smith
should thrive within the Parish. But I exspatiate too far, and desire a
favorable construction.

Not far from Otford, Burials in Holmes Dal^
in the same valley, called Holmes Dale (that is to say, the Dale between the
wooddie hills) many expert worthy Commanders, and valiant common soldiers lie
interred: For here the people of Kent being encouraged by the prosperous
success of Edward their king (the son of Aelfred, and commonly surnamed the
Elder) assemb^ed themselves, and gave to the Danes, that had many years before
afflicted them, a most sharp and fierce encounter, in the which after long
fight they prevailed, and the Danes were overthrown and vanquished, in the
year of Grace, 904.

This victory (says Lambard) and the like event in another battle given to
the Danes at Otford, which also stands in the same valley, begat, as I guess,
the common byword, used amongst the inhabitants of this vale even till this
present day, in which they vaunt after this manner.

The Vale of Holmesdale,
Never won, ne never shall.
These and many other victories achieved by the valor of these Kentish
Inhabitants, gives me occasion to speak somewhat in general of this
flourishing country; and first I will begin with a late writer.

To Canterbury then as kindly he resorts,
His famous country thus he gloriously reports.
O noble Kent, M. Drayton. Polyol. Song 18.
quoth he, this praise does thee belong,
The hard'st to be controld, impatientest of wrong.
Who, when the Norman first with pride and horror swayed,
Threw'st off the servile yoke upon the English laid;
And with a high resolve, most bravely did restore,
That liberty so long enjoyed by thee before.
Not suffering foreign Laws should thy free customs bind,
Then only showd'st thy self of the ancient Saxon kind.
Of all the English Shires be thou surnamd the free,
And foremost ever placed, when they shall reckoned be.
And let this Town, which chief of thy rich country is,
Of all the British Sees be still Metropolis.
Of their throwing off the Norman yoke, his learned Illustrator Seldom thus
speaks.

To explain it, says he, I thus English you a fragment of an old Monk: When
the Norman Conqueror had the day, he came to Dover Castle, that he might with
the same subdue Kent also; wherefore Stigand, Archbishop, and Egelsin Abbot, as
the chief of the Shire; observing that now whereas heretofore no Villeins (the
Latin is, Nullus fuerat seruus, and applying it to our Law phrase I translate
it) had been in England, they should be now all in bondage to the Normans,
they assembled all the County, and showed the eminent dangers, the insolence of
the Normans, and the hard condition of Villenage: they resolving all rather to
die then lose their freedom, purpose to encounter with the Duke for their
countries liberties. Their Captains are the Archbishop and the Abbot. Upon an
appointed day they meet all at Swanescombe, and harboring themselves in the
woods, with Boughs in every man's hand, they incompasse his way. The next day,
the Duke coming by Swanescombe, seemed to see with amazement, as it were a
wood approaching toward him; the Kentish men at the sound of a Trumpet take
themselves to Arms, when presently the Archbishop and Abbot were sent to the
Duke, and saluted him with these words: Behold, Sir Duke, the Kentish come to
meet you, willing to receive you as their Liege Lord, upon that condition,
that they may for ever enjoy their ancient Liberties and Laws used among their
Ancestors; otherwise, presently offering war; being ready rather to die, then
undergo a voke of bondage, and loose their ancient Laws* The Norman in this
narrow pinch, not so willingly, as wisely, granted the desire: and hostages
given on both sides, the Kentishmen direct the Normans to Rochester, and
deliver them the County and the Castle of Dover.

Io. Sari^^^r. de Nugis Curial. li. 6 ca 18.
Again for this honor of the Kentish in having the foremost place in every
battle, he delivers thus much out of an old Author, who writ in Latin about
the time of Henry the second. Which by him is likewise thus taught to speak
English

What performance king Cnut did among the Danes, and Norwegians by English
valor, is apparent in that until this day, the Kentish men for their singular
virtue then shown, have prerogative always to be in the Vantgard: as
Wiltshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall in the Rere.

Camd. in Kent.
And further for the prowess of the Kentish men, will it please you read a
piece out of Camden, the like in effect as before.

The same commendation of civility and courtesy (says he) which Caesar in old
time gave the Inhabitants of Kent, is yet of right due unto them: that I may
not speak of their warlike prowess, whereas a certain Monk has written;
How the Kentishmen so far excelled, that when our armies are ready to join
battle, they of all Englishmen, are worthily placed in the front, as being
reputed the most valiant and resolute soldiers. Which John of Salisbury
verifieth also in his Polycraticon. For good desert (says he) of that notable
valor, which Kent showed so puissantly, and patiently against the Danes, it
retains still unto these days, in all battles, the honor of the first and
fore-ward, yea and of the first conflict with the enemy. In praise of whom
William of Malmesbury has likewise written thus. The country people and
Towne-dwellers of Kent, above all Englishmen retain still the resent of their
ancient worthiness. And as they are more forward, and readier to give honor
and entertainment to others, so they are more slow to take revenge upon others.

Lambard in his perambulation speaking of the Estate of Kent, says, The people
of this country consists chiefly (as in other countries also) of the Gentry
and the Yeomanrie, of which the first be, for the most part, Governors, and the
other altogether governed: whose possessions also were at the first
distinguished, by the names of Knights fee, and Gauelkinde: that former being
proper to the warrior, and this latter to the husbandman. But these tenures
long since have been so indifferently mixed and confounded in the hands of
each sort, that there is not now any note of difference to be gathered by them.

The revenues of the Gentry are greater here then any where else, The Gentry
of Kent.
which thing grows not so much by the quantity of their possession, or by
the fertility of their soil, as by the benefit of the situation of the
country it self. Which has all that good neighborhood, that Marc. Cato, and
other old Authors in husbandry, require in a well placed Graunge, that is to
say, the Sea, the River, a populous City, and a well traded highway, by the
commodities whereof, the superfluous fruits of the ground be dearly sold, and
consequently the land may yield a greater rent.

These Gentlemen be all (for the most part) acquainted with good letters, and
especially trained in the knowledge of the Laws: They use to manure some large
portion of their territories, as well for the maintenance of their families, as
also for their better increase in wealth. So that they be well employed, both
in the public service, and in their own particular, and do use hawking,
hunting, and other disports, rather for their recreation, then for an
occupation or pastime.

The Yeomanrie or common people (for so they be called of the Saxon word gemen,
The Yeomanry of Kent.
which signifies common) is no where more free and jolly then in this Shire:
for besides that they themselves say in a claim (made by them in the time of
king Edward the first) that the Communaltie of Kent was never vanquished by the
Conqueror, but yielded it self by composition: And besides Geruasius
Dorobernens. (or Geruis a Monk in Canterbury, who flourished in the reign of
king Henry the first) affirms that the fore-ward in all battles belongs to
them (by a certain pre-eminence) in right of their manhood. And it is agreed
by all men, that there were never any bondmen (or villains as the law calls
them) in Kent. Neither be they here so much bounden to the Gentry by
Copyhold, or customarie tenures, as the Inhabitants of the western Countries
of the Realm be, nor at all endangered by the feeble hold of Tenant Right,
(which is but a descent of a tenancie at will) as the Common people in the
Northern parts be: for Copyhold tenure is rare in Kent, and Tenant Right not
heard of at all. But in place of these, the custom of Gauelkinde, (that is,
Give all Kin) prevailing every where, in manner every man is a Freeholder,
and has some part of his own to live upon. And in this their estate, they
please themselves, and joy exceedingly; in so much, as a man may find sundry
Yeomen (although otherwise for wealth comparable with many of the gentile sort)
that will not yet for all that change their condition, nor desire to be
apparrelled with the titles of Gentry.

Neither is this any cause of disdain, or of alienation of the good minds of
the one sort from the other. For no where else in all this Realm, is the
common people more willingly governed. To be short, they be most commonly
civil, just, and bountiful: so that the estate of the old Franklyns and
Yeomen of England, either yet lives in Kent, or else it is quite dead and
departed out of the Realm for altogether. Thus far in effect out of Lambard.
Briefly, says Seldom, it had the first English King; in it was the first
Christianity among the English, and Canterbury then honored with the
Metropolitique See: all which give note of Honorable Prerogative. But I will
conclude this commendation of Kent with these verses following, taken out of
the foresaid Author of Polyolbion, in the same Song.

When as the pliant Muse, straight turning her about,
And coming to the Land as Medway goes out,
Saluting the dear soil, O famous Kent, quoth she,
What country has this Isle that can compare with thee,
Which have within thy self as much as thou can wish?
Thy conies, Venson, Fruit, thy sorts of Foul and Fish:
And what with strength comports, thy hay, thy corn, thy wood:
Nor any thing does want, that any where is good.
Now here, before I take my leave of this little See of Rochester, it shall not
seem impertinent (I hope) to show, The conclusion of this Diocese.
with what great courage and happiness this Church has ever vpholden her
rights and privileges, not only against the Monks of Canterbury (which
labored much to bring it under) but also against the Sea it self of the
Archbishops.

Lamb.
For example, in the reign of king Henry the third, and after the death of
Benedict (the Bishop of Rochester) the Monks made choice of one Henry Sanford
(that great wise Clerk, which preached at Sittingbourne, that such a day the
souls of king Richard the first, Godwin.
Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, and another Priest, were delivered
out of Purgatory, and no more souls that day, but only they three, as God had
revealed it unto him three several times) whereof when the Monks of
Christ-Church had intelligence, they resisted the election, challenging that
the Pastoral staff or Crosyer of Rochester ought of very right to be brought
to their house, after the decease of the Bishop, and that the election ought to
be made in their Chapter. The Monks of Rochester maintained their own
choice, and so the matter waxing warm between them, it was at the length
referred to the determination of the Archbishop: he again posted it over to
certain Delegates, who hearing the parties, and weighing the proofs, gave
sentence with the Monks of Rochester, and yet lost (as they thought) good love
and amity among them. But (as the Poet says) Male sarta gratia, nequicquam
coit, sed rescinditur: Favor that is evil peeced, will not join close, but
falls asunder. And therefore this their opinion failed them, and their cure
proved but to be patched: for soon after, the sore brake out anew, and the
Canterbury Monks revived their displeasure with such a heat, that Hubert of
Burgh, Earl of Kent, and chief Justice of England, was driven to come into
the Chapter house and cool it, and to work a second reconciliation between
them. Neither for all that (as it may seem) was that flame quite extinguished.
For not long after, viz. Ann. 1238. the Monks of Christ-Church seeing that
they themselves could not prevail, entitled their Archbishop Edmund, with
whom also the Rochester Monks waged law at Rome before the holy Father (as
touching the election of Richard Wendeouer, whom they would have had Bishop) by
the space of three whole years together: and at the length, either through the
equity of the cause, or the weight of their purse (says my Author) overthrew
him, Lamb.
upon Saint Cuthberts day, in joy whereof, they returned home with all have,
and enacted in their Chapter house, that from thenceforth, for ever, Saint
Cuthberts feast (as a Trophey of their victory) should be holden double, both
in their Church and Kitchen.

And not thus only, but otherwise also, has the Sea at Rochester well holden
her own: for during the whole succession of fourscore Bishops and one (as I
have said before) which in right line have followed Iustus, she has
continually maintained her chair at this one place: whereas in most parts of
the Realm besides, the Sees of the Bishops have suffered sundry translations,
by reason that in the Conquerours time, order was taken, that such Bishops, as
before had their Churches in country Towns and Villages, should forthwith
remove, and from thenceforth remain in walled Towns and Cities: which
ordinance could not by any means touch Rochester, that was a walled City long
time before king Williams government.

Here ends the Diocese of Rochester.
ANCIENT FUNERAL MONVMENTS WITHIN THE Diocese of LONDON.
AS before I have said somewhat of the Cities of Canterbury and Rochester; so
give me leave to speak a little of this great City of London, collected out of
as well ancient as modern writers. And first I will borrow a few lines from
John Iohnston, before remembered, sometimes Professor of Divinity in the
University of S. Andrews in Scotland: who in a grave note and serious style
compiled certain Latin verses in praise of this our Metropolis, Camd. Midlesex
or sovereign City of this Island. Which I find to be translated by Philemon
Holland, thus.

This City well Augusta called, to which (a truth to say)
Air, Land, Sea, and all Elements, show favor every way,
The weather no where milder is, the ground most rich to see,
Does yield all fruits of fertile soil, that never spent will be:
And Ocean, that with Tams stream his flowing tide does blend
Conueyes to it commodities, all that the world can send.
The noble seat of Kings it is, for port and royalty,
Of all the Realm the fence, the heart, the life, and lightsome ^y,
The people ancient, valourous, expert in chiualry,
Enriched with all sorts and means of Art and Mystery.
Take heedfull view of every thing, and then say thus in brief,
This either is a world it self, or of the world the chief.
Sir Robert Dallington knight, in his view of France; comparing the City of
Paris with London, says, That Paris is the greater, the fairer built, and the
better situate: London is the richer, the more populous, the more ancient,
which is an honor as well to great Cities, as to great families. And more
ancient it is then any true Record bears witness, says Speed. Fabuled from
Brute Troynouant, from Lud Ludstone; but by more credible writers; Tacitus,
Ptolemy, and Antonine, Londinium; by Amianus Marcellinus for her successiue
prosperity, Augusta, the greatest title that can be given to any.

It was the first built City questionless of all in the kingdom. Of which my
old Rimer Robert of Gloucester.

Ye furste lords and maistres that in yis land were
And ye chyff tounes furst yey le^e arer.
London and York.
Euerwyk, Lyncolne, and Leycestre,
Colchestre, and Canterbery, Bristo^, and Wercestre.
And many Other.
oyer tounes mo in Engelond and in Walis.
This City, Speed. Midlesex.
in respect of all other Cities of this Island, does show as the Cedars among
other trees, being the seat of the British kings, the Chamber of the English,
the model of the land, and the Mart of the world: for thither are brought the
silk of Asia, the spices from Africa, the Balmes from Grecia, and the riches
of both the Indies East and West. No city standing so long in fame, nor any
for divine and politic government may with her be compared.

It would ask, In Midlesex.
says Camd. a long time to discourse, particularly, of the good Laws and
orders, of the laudable government, of the port and dignity of the Mayor and
Aldermen, of their forward service and loyalty to their Prince, of the
Citizens courtesy, the fair building and costly furniture, the breed of
excellent and choice wits, their gardens in the suburbs full of dainty
Arbours, and banqueting rooms, stored also with strange herbs from foreign
countries, of the multitude, strength, and furniture of their ships, the
incredible store of all sorts of merchandise; and of the superabundance of all
things which belong to the furniture or necessity of man's life. According as
Hadrianus Iunius writes in his Philippeis, thus turned into English.

Thick built with houses London is, with riches stuffed full,
Proud (if we may so say) of men that therein live and dwell,
Where in most plenteous wise abound all things that tongue can tell.
Will. Warner writing of the foundation and Founder of this renowned City,
gives it the like attributes.

Now, Albions England Chap. 14.
if the Conqueror, this Isle had Brutaine unto name,
And with his Trojans Brute began manurage of the same.
For razed Troy to rear a Troy, fit place he searched then,
And viewes the mounting Northern parts: These fit (quoth he) for men,
That trust as much to flight as fight: our bulwarks are our breasts,
The next Arriuals here, perchance, will gladlier build their nests:
A Trojans courage is to him a Fortress of defense:
And leaving so where Scots be now, he Southward makes thence:
Whereas the earth more plenty gave, and air more temperature,
And nothing wanted that by wealth or pleasure might allure.
And more, the Lady Flood of Floods, the River Thamis, it
Did seem to Brute against the foe, and with himself to fit.
Upon whose fruitful banks therefore, whose bounds are chiefly said,
The wantlesse Counties Essex, Kent, Surrey, and wealthy Glayde
Of Hartfordshire, for Cities store participating aid,
Did Brute build up his Troy-nouant, in closing it with wall.
Which Lud did after beautify, and Luds-towne it did call,
That now is London evermore to rightful Princes true,
Yea Prince and people still to it, as to their store house drew,
For plenty and for populous, the like we no where view.
Howbeit many Neighbor-towns as much ere now could say;
But place for people, people, place, and all for sin decay.
But of this matter many have spoken much, and it is needless for me to say
any more, especially considering that I shall have occasion to say somewhat
hereafter upon the said subject, when I come to the burial of king Brutus. In
the mean time I will conclude with a Rhyme Dogerell in commendation of London,
as the Author himself calls it, who was Robert Fabian (Alderman and Sheriff
of this honorable City, in the ninth year of king Henry the seventh) which
you may read in the Prologue to the second volume of his Chronicle of England
and France.

Now would I feign,
In words plain,
Some Honor said,
And bring to mind:
Of that ancient City,
That so goodly is to se,
And full true ever has be
And also full kind.
To Prince and king
That has borne just rulynge
Syn the first winnynge
Of this Island by Brute.
So that in great honor
By passing of many a shower,
It has ever borne the flower,
And laudable brute.
Of every City and town,
To search the world rowne,
Never yet cast down,
As other many have be:
As Rome and Carthage,
Jerusalem the sage,
With many other of age
In storye as ye may see.
This so oldely founded,
Is so surely grounded,
That no man may confound yt,
It is so sure a stone,
That yt is upon set,
For though some have yt thrette
With Manasses grym and great
Yet hurt had yt none.
Christ is the very stone
That the City is set upon;
Which from all his foon,
Has ever preserved yt.
By mean of dyvyne service
That in contynuall wise
Is kept in devout guyse
UUythin the mure of yt.
As houses of Relygyon
In diverse places of this town,
Which in great devotion,
Ben ever occupied:
When one has done another begin,
So that of prayer they never blyn,
Such order is these houses within
With all virtue allied.
The Paryshe Chyrches to reken,
Of which number I shall speken,
Wherein speak many priest and deken,
And Eryste daily they serve.
By mean of which sacryfyce
I trust that he in all wise,
This City for her servyce
Does ever more preserve.
This City I mean is Troynouaunt,
Where honor and worschipp does haunt,
UUyth virtue and riches accordaunt,
No City to yt like.
To speak of every commodity,
Flesh, and fish, and all dentye,
Cloth, and sylke, with wine plenty,
That is for hole and syke.
Bread and ale, with spyces fine,
With houses fair to soupe and dyne.
Nothing lackynke that is condygne
For man that is on molde.
UUyth rivers fresh, and wholesome air,
With women that be good and fair;
And to this City done repair
Of strangers many fold,
The vytayle that herein is spente,
In three housholdes daily tente:
Between Rome and rich Kent,
Are none may them compare.
As of the Mayre and Shriues twain.
What might I of the justice said,
Kept wythyn this City plain
It were long to declare.
For though I should all day tell,
Or that with my ryme dogerell
Might I not yet half do spell
This towns great honor
Therefore shortly as I began,
Pray for yt both child and man,
That yt may continue, and
To bear of all the flower.
To his Reader of these rymes.
Who so him lyketh these versys to read,
With favor I pray he will them spell
Let not the rudenes of them him led
For to despraue this ryme dogerell
Some part of the honor it does you tell
Of this old City Troynouant
But not thereof the half dell
Connyng in the maker is so adaunt.
But though he had the eloquence
Of Tully, and the moralytye
Of Senek, and the influence
Of the swyte sugared Armony,
Or that fair Lady Caliope,
Yet had he not connyng perfyght:
This City to praise in each degree
As yt should duly ask by right.
Saint Paul's Church.
The foundation of Saint Paul's Church.
As of the Cathedral Churches in Canterbury and Rochester, so, I find
Ethelbert, king of Kent, to be the Founder of this, here in London; dedicated
to the honor of the everliving God, and Saint Paul, Doctor of the Gentiles.
These are the words of his Charter, preserved here in the Church.

Diploma Regis Ethelberti.
In Christi nomine Aedelbertus Rex Deo inspirante, pro anime sue remedio, dedit
Episcopo Melito terram que appellatur Tillingeham, ad Monasterij sui solatium,
scilicet Sancti Pauli Apostoli Doctoris Gentium. Et ego Aedelbertus ita
firmiter concedo tibi Presuli Melito potestatem eius habendi and possidendi, vt
in perpetuum in Monasterij vtilitate permaneat. Si quis vero contradicere
temptauerit hanc donationem, Anathema and excomunicatus sit ab omni societate
Christiana, vsque ad satisfactionem. Qua de re ego Episcopus Melitus vna cum
Rege Aedeberto Humfredum Episcopum subscribere rogaui.

Signum manus Humfredi Episcopi.
Signum manus Letharij Episcopi.
Signum manus Abbane.
Signum manus Aethelpaldi.
Signum manus Aespine and aliorum multorum.
Besides this his gift of Tillingham in Essex; dedit viginti quatuor Hidas
terre iuxta Londoniam (as the Lieger book of this Church speaks) the greatest
part of which was afterward divided into Prebends, as More, Finnesbury,
Oldstreet, Wenlocksborne, Hoxton, Newington, S. Pancrace, Kentishtowne,
Totenhall, Ragener, Holborne, Portpole, Iseldon, and there only remained to
the Deane and Chapter, Norton Folgate.

King Athelstan at the request of Bishop Theodred (surnamed the good) gave
Monasterio Sancti Pauli in Londonia Ciuitate, etc. december Mansas ad Sandonam cum
Rode, and octo ad Eardlage (now Yerdley) cum Luffenhede, et december ad Bylchampe
cum Picham, et octo ad Lidwolditon (nunc Heybridge) et duodecim ad Runwellam,
et triginta ad Edelfesnesam (now Paul's soken in Essex) et december ad Breytane, et
octo ad Berne; et december ad Neoldune cum Pislesdune.

King Edgar at the request of Bishop Dunstan, and his third son (beautiful
young Ethelred) pro sexaginta Mancis auri puri (which is threescore Marks of
our English money) dedit ad Monasterium Sancti Pauli viginti quinque Mansiones,
in loco qui vocatur Nasinstocke: Which were confirmed by Etheldred, and diverse
succeeding kings.

Canutus or Knute the Dane, king of England, not only confirms his
predecessors gifts, but also founds and endowes the dignity of the Deanery,
with the Church of Lamborne (in Barkshire) pro victu decani qui pro tempore
fuerit, The first Deane whereof was Leuegarus (as appears by an ancient
Catalogue of the Deanes amongst the Antiquities of this Church) whom succeeded
Godwynus, Syredus, Gulielmus, Elfwynus, Luiredus, and in the Conquerours time
Wolfmannus, after him Radulphus de Diceto, that great and judicious Antiquarie;
Qui velut alter Josephus, aut Philo, (says Bale Cent. 2.) suae gentis vetera
Monumenta, atque inclita facta perpetuare studens, multa retroactis seculis
incognita produxit in lucem.

Edward the Confessor confirms the gift of Wygaley (now West Lee in Essex)
which one Ediua a religious woman gave, Fratribus Sancti Pauli, and also gives
himself Monasterio Sancti Pauli, octo Mansas ad Berling, et quinque ad
Cynford, now Chyngford in Essex.

Kensworth and Caddington, and diverse other lands were given to this Church
before the Conquest, In Arch. Turris Land. Cartae antiqua A.
all which the Conqueror confirms by his Charter remaining amongst the
Records in the Tower, adding thereunto many ample privileges and immunities.
Quia volo (says he) vt ista Ecclesia ita sit libera in omnibus, sicut volo
esse animam meam in die iudicij. Moreover, besides this confirmation, he gave
unto this Church, and Mauritius the Bishop, the Castle of Stortford or Storford
in Hertfordshire, with all the appurtenances belonging thereunto, for ever: and
namely, the land which William the Deacon, and Raph his brother held of the
king.

William Rufus by his deed sealed, freeth the Canons of Paul's from all works to
the walls and Tower of London, and withal confirms all his fathers donations
and privileges. This deed was dated at Hereford.

Since which time, one Peter Newport (of which name and family many lie
entombed in burnt Pelham, within Hertfordshire) gave unto this Church two
hundred acres of wood, in Hadley, and Thundersey, in Essex, and fourscore
Acres of arable land with a Brewhouse; out of which the Deane and Chapter were
to pay a certain sum of money to a Priest to say Mass for his soul.

Sir Philip Basset knight, gave Drayton to the Deane and Chapter, to the intent
that they should pay 15. l. for ever to three Chapleynes, for the like service
of saying Mass, and his Executours gave Hayrstead, out of which there was
yearly spent five pounds for an Obit.

The Executors of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, gave to this Church the
Manors of Bows, and Pecleshouse in Midlesex, for the maintenance of certain
Priests, to sing Mass for his soul. And of these Manors the Church was
possessed until the latter end of king Henry the eight.

The Churches of Willesdon, Sunbury, Brickesley, Rickling, and Aueley, were
impropriated to the Deane, and Chapter, by diverse Bishops; the Impropriations
whereof were theirs at that time.

Besides their lands and revenues in the country, these Churchmen had diverse
houses in the City, which were granted sometime Deo et Sancto Paulo, sometime
Deo et Sancti Pauli seruientibus, sometime Sancto Paulo et Canonicis. Of these
I have seen many deeds, among which one is most remarkable, dated in the year
1141. the sixth of king Stephen, and fastened with a labell to the end of a
stick, of what wood I know not, howsoever it remains to this day free from
worme-holes, or any the least corruption, not so much as in the bark. Whereby
one Robert Fitz-Gousbert, for his souls health, gives unto this Church a
certain parcel of land, or an house, containing eight foot in breadth, and
six in length. Upon which wood, or stick, these words following are very
fair written, Per hoc lignum oblata est terra Roberti filij Gousberti super
altar Sancti Pauli in festo omnium Sanctorum. Testibus, etc.

But to make an end of this discourse. Primitiua Ecclosie Sancti Pauli London
fundatio (says the Lieger book) consistit in Episcopo, triginta maioribus
Canonicis, duodecim minoribus, et triginta vicarijs: which differs from her
present state, having at this time for her governors, a Bishop, a Deane, a
Precentor, a Chancellor, a Treasurer, and five Archdeacons, viz of London,
Middlesex, Essex, Colchester, and S. Albons, and thirty Prebendaries; and
besides to furnish the Quire in divine service, Pety-Canons twelve, Vicars
Chorall six, and ten Queristers, etc.

This Bishopric comprehends the City of London, with the counties of
Middlesex, and Essex, and the Deanries of Saint Albans, and Braughing in
Hertfordshire. And is valued in the kings books at 1119. l. 8. s. 4. d. and
yielded the Pope from every Bishop at his first entrance 3000. Florins, besides
sixteen pounds ten shillings for Rome-scot, or Peter Pence. But now to the
Monuments.

Sebba king of the East Saxons
Hic iacet Sebba Rex Orientalium Saxonum qui conuersus fuit ad fidem per S.
Erkenwaldum Londinens. Episcopum, anno Christi 677. Vir multum Deo deuotus,
actibus religiosis, crebris precibus, and pijs eleemosynarum fructibus plurimum
intentus; vitam priuatam et monasticam cunctis regni diuitijs and honoribus
preferens. Qui cum regnasset annis 30. habitum religiosum accepit per
benedictionem Waltheri Londinens. Lib. 4. cap. 11.
Antistitis qui prefato Erkenwaldo successit, de quo venerabilis Beda in
Historia gentis Anglorum.

The same Author further affirms, that he not only relinquished his Princely
robes, and put on the habit of a Monk (a thing usual (as you have heard
before) with the Saxon kings in the infancy of Christian Religion) but also
instigated his wife to leave the momentanie pleasures of Courtly estate, and to
follow him in his virtuous devotions, which with much ado he obtained. Here he
continued a Monk in this Monastery (for in his time, says Radulphus de
Diceto, were Monks in this Church) until the day of his death, which happened
in the year 693.

Of this king Sebba thus much out of a late writer, Mich. Draiton, Polyol.
Cant. 11.

Then Sebba of his seed, that did them all surpass,
Who fitter for a Shrine, then for a Scepter was.
(Above the power of flesh his appetite to sterue
That his desired Christ he strictly might observe)
Even in the height of life, in health, and body strong,
Persuaded with his Queen, a Lady fair and young:
To separate themselves, and in a sole estate,
After religious sort themselves to dedicate.
Hic iacet Etheldredus, Etheldred king of England, surnamed, The Unready.

Coronam, fertur S. Dunstanus Cantuar. Archiepiscopus dira predixisse his
verbis. Quoniam aspirasti ad Regnum per mortem fratris tui, in cuius sanguine
conspirauerunt Angli cum ignominiosa matre tua, non deficiet gladius de domo
tua seuiens in te omnibus diebus vite tue, interficiens de semine tuo quousque
regnum tuam transferatur in regnum alienum, cuius ritum et linguam gens cui
presides non nouit; nec expiabitur nisi longa vindicta peccatum tuum, et
peccatum matris tue, and peccata virorum qui interfuere concilio illius nequam.
Que sicut a viro sancto predicta erant, euenerunt. Nam Etheldredus varijs

ac tandem Londini arcta obsidione conclusus, misere diem obijt anno dominice
incarnationis 1017. postquam annis 36. in magna tribulatione regnasset.

This Etheldred being neither forward in action, Will. Malms.
nor fortunate in his proceedings, was commonly called, The unready, an
oppressor rather then a ruler of this kingdom, cruel in the beginning,
wretched in the middle, and shameful in the end. Of the calamities of these
times by the Danish invasion, will it please you hear my old Author.

Besides the prophecy of Dunstan, here set down in this Inscription, and thus
ratified by the event; the transferring of this kingdom to other Nations, was
further likewise prophetically foretold by an holy Anchorite, says, Hen.
Hunting: Englished in these words by the Translatour of Ranulph, Monk of
Chester. Lib 6 cap. ^: ^ib. 1^ ca ^lt.


But among all Englyshemen meddled togydres is so great changyng and diuersyte
of clothyng and array, and so many manner of diverse shappes, that well nigh is
there any man known by his clothyng and his array of whatsoever degree that he
be. Thereof prophezyed an holy Anchor in K. Etheldred.
Egelfreds time in this manner.

Englyshmen for as much as they use to dronkelewnes, to Treason, and to
rechlesnes of Gods house, first by Danes, and then by Normans, and at third
time by Scotts they shall be overcome.

Suauis victoria Amor populi. The love of the people was a pleasant sweet
Conquest (a Motto which I saw depicted under the Arms of our late Sovereign
Lord King James, over one of the gates at York, upon his first auspicious
entrance into that ancient City, Ann. 1603. die Aprilis 16.) Thus for a king
to overcome, was but to come, and to be welcome, to be received of his
Subjects in all places, with shouts and acclamations of joy, demonstrations of
truest loyalty, love, and obedience, and to be conducted and guarded with an
admirable confluence of his Nobility, Gentry, and Commons, unto the Throne of
his lawful inheritance.

Erkenwald Bishop of Land.
Hoc in loco requiescit in domino Erconwaldus tertius post Anglosaxonum in
Britannia ingressam Episcopus Londinensis, cuius in Episcopatu, and ante
Episcopatum vita fuit sanctissima: ex nobili prosapia oriundus. Offe
orientalium Saxonum Regis erat filius, ad fidem Christianam a Mellito primo
Londini Episcopo An. Dom. 642. conuersus.

Is priusquam Episcopus factus esset duo preclara construxit Monasteria
sumptibus suis, de bonis que ture hereditario sibi obuenerunt. Vnum sibi in
finibus Australium Saxonum loco qui Certesey vocatur: alterum Edelburge sorori
sue femine laudatissime ad Berching in ditione Orientalium Saxonum.

In Episcopatum vero anno salutis, 675. a Theodoro D^robernensium sieve
Cantuarie Archiepiscopo sacratus est: Sebbam Orientalium Saxonum Regem ad
Christi sidem conuertit, et salutari Baptismatis vnda suis manibus per fudit,
qui statim mundo renuncians, se totum Deo addixit, and in hac ipsa Ecclesia
archa marmorea (que ad nostra vsque tempora permanet) sepultus est. Idem
Erconwaldus celeberrimum hoc S. Pauli templum nouis edificijs auxit,
prouentibus locupletauit, et eidem immunitates nonnullas a Regibus impetrauit.
Tandem circiter annum Domini 685. spiritum Deo reddidit, postquam annis vndecim
in pontificatu sedisset. Et magnifico sepulchro hic conditus est, quod nostra
memoria circiter annum Domini, 1533. hoc loco visebatur.

This careful holy Bishop Erconwald, not only bestowed great pains and
charges upon the beautifying and enlarging his Church with fair new buildings,
De gestis Pontif. lib. 2.
which he enricht with more ample revenues; and many immunities obtained from
diverse kings and Princes; but also procured from Pope Agatho the first, sundry
important privileges for the good of his Canons. Habetur ergo Erkenwaldus
(says Malmesbury) Londonie maxim sanctus, and pro exauditionis celeritate,
fauorem Canonicorum nonnihil emeritus.

Beda lib. 4. ca. 6.
Venerable Bede, and the Annals of this Church (from whom the most) of this
Inscription is borrowed) do attribute many miracles to the holiness of this
man, Harpsfeeld. Secul. 7. cap. 13.
in regard of which he was canonized, and his Relics translated, Anno salutis
millesimo centesimo quadragesimo: and the fourteenth day of November, appointed
to be kept sacred to his memory. As in our Calendar may be seen.

Hic iacet Eustachius de Fauconberg quondam Episcopus huius Ecclesie qui multa

Land.


This Bishop, as appears by an Inscription annexed to his Tomb, had been one
of the Kings Justices, Lord Treasurer of England, and twice Ambassador into
France. And dyed October. 31. 1228. having governed this See seven years and
six months. Of whom I have read this Epitaph in an old Manuscript.

and Lord Chancellor of England. Rex enim de fidelitate Domini Henrici de

short time, being taken away by death, July 13. 1262. as appears by this
Epitaph.

intollerabili, vt omnes qui aderant rapide fugientes nihil verius quam mortem

purgato Episcopus residuum rei Divine expleuit.

You may read more of him, in Matthew Paris, how stoutly he withstood the
Popes Nuntio, coming here into England with a proling devise to scrape up
money for his Master. How this good Bishop cried out upon the unreasonable and
shameless covetousness of the Court of Rome, and how he was the only means
of staying the course of such grievous exactions.

There you may also read the fearful story of this Cymerian darkness, and
horrible thunderclap, which happened upon the day of S. Paul's conversion, in
this Cathedral Church, the Bishop being then at Mass. Many miracles, says
the same Author, were wrought at his Tomb. But let us hear his Epitaph.

Ecclesie quondam Presul presentis, in anno
M. bis C. quater X. iacet hic Rogerus humatus.
Huius erat manibus Domino locus iste dicatus:
Christ suis precibus veniam des, toll reatus.
It was this Bishop Roger, who excommunicated the Caursini (a dangerous stout
attempt in those days) called the Popes Merchants, but they were indeed most
execrable Roman Usurers, who had entangled the king himself, most of the
Nobility, and all others that had to do with the Court of Rome, in their
cunning snares. They were called Caursini (says Paris) quasi capientes vrsi:
devouring Bears.

This Bishop was advanced to the honor of being Lord Chancellor, upon Saint
Mathewes Eve, in the sixth year of king Richard the second; which office he
enjoyed no longer then the March following, upon some disagreement betwixt him
and John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. Of which you may read more at large in
Tho. Walsingham, Hist. Angl.

Rob. Fitzhugh Bishop of London.
Here lies interred the body of Robert Fitzhugh, Bishop of London, Doctor of
Law, and sometimes Archdeacon of Northampton, who had been twice Ambassador,
once into Germany, and another time to Rome. He was elected Bishop of Ely, but
died before his intended translation could be perfected, September. 22. Ann.
1435. To which effect thus speaks his Epitaph.

Nobilis Antistes Robertus Londoniensis,

This Thomas Kempe was Nephew to John Kempe, Archbishop of Canterbury, at whose
hands he received Consecration, at York place, now called White hall, Ann.

globle. He built also Paul's Cross in form as as it now stands.

Here lies John Stokesley Bishop of this Church, John Stokesley Bishop of
London.
brought up at Magdelene College in Oxford, and here enthronized July 19.
1530. Who died September. 8. 1539. A part of his Epitaph as yet remains inlaid
in brass, which approues him to have been a good Linguist, and a great
Scholar.

I read in the Catalogue of Bishops, William Bishop of London.
and other writers (for all the Inscriptions of any Antiquity, made to the
memory of other Bishops here interred, are altogether erazed or stolen away)
that William a Norman, who enjoyed this Bishopric in the Conquerours time,
lies here interred in the body of the Church. Unto whom the City of London
acknowledges it self greatly beholding, for that the king, by his means and
instant suite, granted unto them all kind of liberties, in as ample manner as
they enjoyed them in the time of his predecessor Ed. the Confessor. These are
the words of the Conquerours grant, written in the Saxon tongue, and sealed
with green wax.

Williem king grets Williem Bisceop, Charta London.
and Godfred Porterefan, and ealle ya Burghwarn binnen London Frencisce and

effect following.

William king greetes William Bishop, and Godfrey Portgraue, and all the Burrow
of London, French and English friendly. And I make known to you, that ye be
worthy to enjoy all that Law and privilege which ye did in the days of King
Edward. And I will that every child be his fathers heir after his fathers
decease. And I will not suffer that any man do unto you any injury. God you
keep.

In thankfulness hereof, the Citizens caused to be engraven an Epitaph upon
his Tomb in Latin, thus Englished by John Stow.

To William, a man famous in wisdom and holiness of life, who first with
Saint Edward the king and Confessor being familiar, of late preferred to be
Bishop of London, and not long after, for his prudencie and sincere fidelity,
admitted to be of Council with the most victorious Prince William king of
England, of that name the first, who obtained of the same great and large
privileges to this famous City. The Senate and Citizens of London, to him
having well deserved, have made this. He continued Bishop twenty years, and
dyed in the year after Christ his nativity, 1070.

These marble Monuments to thee thy Citizens assign,
Rewards (O father) far unfit to those deserts of thine.
Thee unto them a faithful friend, thy London people found,
And to this Town, of no small weight, a stay both sure and sound.
Their liberties restorde to them, by means of thee have been,
Their public weal by means of thee, large gifts have felt and seen
Thy riches, stock, and beauty brave, one hour has them suppressed,
Yet these thy virtues, and good deeds, with us for ever rest.
But this Tomb was long since either destroyed by time, or taken away upon
some occasion: yet howsoever the Lord Mayor of London, and the Aldermen his
brethren, upon those solemn days of their resort to Paul's, do still use to
walk to the grauestone where this Bishop lies buried, in remembrance of their
privileges by him obtained. And now of late years an Inscription fastened to
the pillar next adjoining to his grave (called, The reuiuall of a most worthy
Prelates remembrance, erected at the sole cost and charges of the right
honorable and nobly affected Sir Edward Barkham knight, Lord Mayor of the
City of London, Ann. 1622.) thus speaks to the walkers in Paul's: ^
Walkers, whosoere you be,
If it prove your chance to see,
Upon a solemnes skarlet day,
The City Senate pass this way,
Their grateful memory for to show
Which they the reverend ashes owe
Of Bishop Norman here inhum'd;
By whom this City has assumed
Large privileges. Those obtained
By him, when Conqueror William reigned.
This being by thankful Barkhams mind renewd,
Call it the Monument of Gratitude.


Here lies buried Fulk Basset, Fulke Basset Bishop of London.
Bishop of this Church, preferred hither from the Deanrie of York, a Gentleman
of an ancient great family, second brother of that Gilbert Basset, who through
the stumbling of his horse, fell in a certain wood, Mat. (...)
as he went a hunting in the harvest time, Ann. 1241. and brake so his bones
and sinews, that within a few days after he dyed: and shortly after, even in
the same month, the only son of this Gilbert, being a child, died, whereby
that lordly inheritance came to this Fulk Basset: who, as he was a man of
great lineage, and also of ample, both temporal, and Ecclesiastical
possessions, so was he a Prelate of an invincible high spirit; stout and
courageous to resist those insupportable exactions which the Popes Legate
Rustandus, Paris.
went about to lay upon the Clergy, and at such a time when the Pope and the
king, like the Shepherd and the Woolfe, joined both together to destroy the
Sheepfold. Much what about which time, to the same effect, certain rimes were
scattered abroad, as I have before set down in the Diocese of Canterbury.

Such were the Popes rapines and enormous proceedings in those days, all which
this stout Bishop withstood to the uttermost of his power. He died of the
plague here in London, Ann. 1258. having governed this See 14. years odd
months. A Monument was made to his eternal memory, whereupon this Distich was
inlaid in brass.

Here lies entombed in the North wall, John de Chishull, Io. Chishull Bishop
of Land.
who sometimes had been Deane of Paul's, Archdeacon and Bishop of London, Lord
Treasurer of England, Mat. Westminster.
and twice Keeper of the great Seal. He was consecrated April 29. 1274* and
died the tenth, 1279.

Upon the Monument of Richard Newport, Rich. Newport Bishop of London.
Bishop of this Church here buried, a little inscription not long since was to
be read, expressing the day and year of his consecration, which was March 26.
1317. And the like of his death, which happened August 24. 1318. the year
following.

Raph Baldocke, Raph Baldocke Bishop of London.
Deane of this Church, was chosen Bishop upon Saint Mathias day, 1303. but was
not consecrated till the year 1305. January 30. which he received at the hands
of one Petrus Hispanus, a Cardinal, Bishop of Alba, at Lions in France. He was
a man very well learned, and amongst other things, writ an History or Chronicle
of England, in the Latin tongue. Godwin. Catal.
In his life time he gave two hundred Marks toward the building of the
Chapel on the East end of this Church, now called, The Lady Chapel; wherein
he lies buried: and in his Will bequeathed much toward the finishing of the
same. And here by the way, says mine Author, it shall not be amiss to note,
that in digging the foundation of this building, there were found more then an
hundred heads of cattle, as oxen, kine, stagges, Stow. Annal.
etc. which seem to confirm the opinion of those that think the Temple of
Jupiter was situate in that place before the planting of Christian Religion;
Fran. Thin.
took away those idolatrous sacrifices. This Bishop was chosen Lord
Chancellor by king Edward the first. Upon whose death he sent the great Seal
to king Edward the second, as then lying at Carliell. This Raph is mistaken by
some writers for Robert Baldock, Bishop of Norwich (yet I find no such Bishop
of that See in the Catalogue) sometime Archdeacon of Midlesex, and Chancellor
of England. Much what about that time, a man that lived in the hatred of most
people, whom the old English Chronicle calls a false peeld Priest: Rob.
Glocest.
these are the words; Robart Baldok his false pilide Chanceler (being as then
Chancellor to Edward the second) and in another place, Ye pilide clerk Robart
Baldok, ye falls Chanceler. Yet this pilide falls clerk was ever true to the King
his Lord and Master: for which he was taken and imprisoned in Newgate London,
wherein he miserably ended his days. Of which thus writes the Author of the
book of Durham. ^.

Bishop of this Diocese, who, when from his first confirmation by Robert of
Winchelsey, Bishop of Canterbury, he had sat about eight years, died on S.
James his Eve, 1313. at Stell.

Michaell Northbrooke Bishop of London.
Here lies buried Michaell Northbrooke, Bishop of this See, Doctor of Law, who
had his election confirmed July 7. 1355. and died of the plague, September. 9.
1361. at Copford. This Bishop gave a chest with a thousand Marks; which money
was to be lent to the poor upon security: as appears by his will.

Rich. Clifford Bishop of London.
Here lies interred under a marble stone, near to the Monument of Sir
Christopher Hatton, the body of Richard Clifford, Archdeacon of Canterbury,
from which dignity he was preferred to the Bishopric of Worcester, which he
enjoyed about six years; and from thence translated to this See of London,
which he laudably governed thirteen years, and some months: Godwin. Catal.
and died, August 20. 1421. This Bishop in the year 1414. traveled to the
Council of Constance, and preached in Latin before the Emperor, and other
Estates there assembled. In this Council the long schism was ended, and
Martin the fifth, called before Otho Columna, Cardinal of Saint George, was
chosen the sole Pope. The Council thinking it meet that thirty persons
should be added to the Cardinals in this election; this our Richard Clifford
was one of that number. In which also there were some that named him to the
Papacy. Himself was the first that named the Cardinal Columna: who
thereupon, the rest consenting, was immediately elected.

Between the two pillars, next unto the Steeple, on the North side of the body
of the Church, under a marble stone, over which was built a kind of Tomb,
Richard Fitz-Iames Bishop of London.
or Chapel of wood, that by the burning of the steeple was consumed, and
quite defaced; the body of Rich. Fitz-Iames lies interred. A gentleman of an
ancient house, learned and virtuous: Doctor of Law, brought up in Merton
College in Oxford, and sometimes Warden of the same; Godwin. de Praesul. Ang.
from whence he was advanced to the Bishopric of Rochester, from thence
translated to Chichester, and from Chichester to London. He bestowed much money
in repairing the Church of S. Martins in Oxford, as also in adorning and
beautifying this his own Cathedral Church. He died in the year 1521.

His first wife Blanch, Blanch Duchess of Lancaster.
here buried, died of the plague, says Io. Stow, Ann. 1369. She ordained for
her husband and her self, a solemn Obit to be kept yearly in this Church,
where the Mayor, being present at the Mass with the Sheriffs, Fabian.
Chamberlain, and Swordbearer, should offer each of them a penny, and the
Mayor to take up twenty shillings: the Sheriffs either of them a Mark, the
Chamberlain ten shillings, and the Swordbearer six shillings eight pence, and
every other of the Majors officers (there present) two and twenty pence a
piece: the which Obyte, says Fabian, to this day is holden. She also founded
four Chantrees in this Church for the souls of her self and her husband; and
was greatly beneficial unto the Deane and Canons.

Earl of Lincoln, lies here entombed in the new work, which was of his own

He was styled Earl of Lincoln, Baron of Halton, Constable of Chester, Lord

Laurence Allerthorp Lord Treasurer.
In the same Chapel, dedicated to S. Dunstan, lies Laurence Allerthorp,
sometimes Canon of this Church, and Lord Treasurer of England, with this
Inscription.

Hic iacet Laurentius Allerthorp quondam Thesaurarius Anglie, Canonicus and
Stagiarius istius Ecclesie, qui migrauit ex hoc seculo men's. Iulij die 21. 1406.

This Allerthorp being a man of no more eminency in the Church then a Canon
resident, was never thought of, or not believed, by the Francis Thin
Collector of the Lord Treasurers, to have ascended to such an honor, so that
he lies here in a darksome room, as a sacrifice to oblivion; small notice
taken of him, except by some few of the Churchmen. Now give me leave to tell
you, by way of digression, that howsoever this Allerthorp was but one of the
Canons resident, yet he was solely the one, and had most or all the revenues of
the rest in his hands; for (as the Records of this Church do approve) those
thirty Canons upon the primarie institution, called Canons Regular (because
they led a regular life, and were perpetually resident) and afterward living
abroad, and neglecting the business of their Church, became to be called
Canons secular, contenting themselves with the title of Canon, and some prebend
assigned unto them. Which annexing of lands to the Prebendarie was not till a
long time after the first foundation: whereupon Pope Lucius by his Bull
ordained, that the Canons non-resident, should not partake of the profits of
the lands assigned to the common affairs of the Church, but only such as were
resident (the division of the Churches lands having been made before in the
time of the Conqueror) and this Laurence Allerthorp, at and before the time of
his Treasurship, was solus residentiarius, and had the whole revenue of the
rest at his own disposing, by way of Option, as it is called in the Lieger
book. But of this enough, if not too much. Then to conclude, howsoever this
Allerthorp be altogether excluded out of the Treatise of the Treasurers, and
Sir John Northberie, knight, keeper of the privy Garderobe in the Tower, said
to be Lord Treasurer in the first, second, and third of king Henry the fourth:
in which time the said Allerthorp should enjoy that office, or not at all. Yet
these words in his Patent, together with this Epitaph, do approve him to have
been adorned with the honorable Office of a solicitous Lord Treasurer.

valor, wisdom, and true service, that he committed to his governance his
only son (then living) Richard of Burdeux; who, being afterward king of
England, by the name of Richard the second, advanced him to high honors,
offices, and promotions: and nothing was done in matters of State without his
appointment and direction. Thus he continued always loyal to his Sovereign
Lord the king; yet lived in the hatred of the Peers of the Land, as also of
the common people, for that he leaned to the party of Robert de Veere, Stow.

Earl of Oxford, Duke of Ireland, and the kings favorite, and was an
oppressor of the poor Commons: insomuch that by the sentence of that
Parliament, which wrought wonders, An. 11. Ric. secundi, he was condemned of
treason, and beheaded on the Tower hill; as in the Inscription.

He was first Vicechamberlaine to king Richard, who made him Constable of Dover
Castle, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports; delivering the keys of the said
Castle to the said Simon in sign of possession: so much would he grace him
with his presence, thus recorded.

This flower of our English Garden, this learned father of the Law, this
blessed man (as this Epitaph would make him) was no better then a bribing
Judge; for, being a chief Commissioner for the government of the kingdom, in
the absence of Edward the first, he, with many others of his profession, were,
at the kings return, found guilty by act of Parliament, of manifest
corruption, Judges fined for briberie and extortion.
in their administration of Justice, and deeply fined for such their
intolerable extortions. First this Sir Raph Hengham, chief Justice of the
higher Bench, was fined to pay to the king seven thousand Marks. Stow. Annal.
Sir John Loueton Justice of the lower Bench 3000. Marks. Sir William Brompton
Justice, 6000. Marks. Sir Solomon Rochester, 4000. Marks. Sir Richard Boyland
4000. Marks. Sir Thomas Sodington 2000. Marks. Sir Walter Hopton 2000.
Marks. These four last were Justices Itinerants. Sir William Saham 3000.
Marks. Robert Lithbury, Master of the Rolls, 1000. Marks. Roger Leicester
1000. Marks. Henry Bray Escheater, and Judge for the Jews, 1000. Marks.
Robert Preston 1000. Marks. But Sir Adam Stratton, chief Baron of the
Exchequer, was fined in thirty four thousand Marks. And Thomas Weyland (found
the greatest delinquent, and of greatest substance) had all his goods, and
whole estate confiscated to the king, and withal banished the kingdom.

This Sir Raph Hengham was a Norfolk man borne, as I have it out of an old
Record; these are the words. Radulphus de Hengham ex eadem ortus esse videtur
familia, ex qua, Willielmus filius Ade de Hengham et Richardus de Hengham in

He flourished in the reigns of Henry the third, and Edward the first, and died
in the first year of Edward the second, 1308.

His Monument is lately revived by the Company of the mystery of Mercers, to
whose charge he committed the oversight of S. Paul's School, with lands worth
an hundred and twenty pounds or better, of yearly value: for the maintenance
of a Master, an Usher, and a Chaplain; to teach and instruct one hundred
fifty and three poor men's children freely, without any reward. And (as I am
told) Vijs and modis, more comes to the Schoolmaster at this day, then the
whole endowment.

John Bale says, Cent. 5.
that of twenty and two children which his father Henry Collet (Mercer, and
Lord Mayor of London) had by Christian his wife, he was the only child living
at his fathers death* that he died of the sweating sickness, aged sixty three
years: that he was brought up in Oxford, that he traveled into France and
Italy; that he disputed with the Sorbonists in Paris, from whose Tenets he
much dissented; that he inuayed against Monks which did not lead an
Evangelical life; and Bishops, Qui pro Pastoribus lupos agebant: that he was
eruditione facundus; that he writ many Treatises left in loose papers, which,
but by himself, could not be made perfect: That he taught in his Sermons
that it was unlawful for a Clergie-man to accumulate riches, and for any man
to worship Images: that by Richard Fitz-Iames, then Bishop of London, and two
Minorites, Bricot and Standish, he was accused of heresy, and that his corpse
had been cast out of his Tomb and burnt, if an unexpected accident had not
prevented his enemies designs.

This man, Bale Cent. 5.
integer vitae scelerisque purus, as Bale says, lived for a certain time in
the Isle of Rhodes, and some years in Italy, where he instructed himself in
all good literature, and made himself perfect in many languages: withal he
was quick, apprehensiue, and ingenious: and therefore entirely beloved of Sir
Thomas Moore. He writ diverse books, but he is best known by his Grammar. He
was borne in the Town of Odiham in Hampshire.

Here lies buried in a Chapel built by himself, wherein he founded three
Chaplains, Sir John Poultney, Si^ (...) Lord (...)
four times Lord Mayor of London: who founded also a College in the Parish
Church of S. Laurence, called Poultney. He built also the parish Church, called
little Alhallows in Thames street; ^
and the Carmelite Friars Church in Couentrie: he gave relief to the
prisoners in Newgate, and in the Fleet, and ten shillings the year to S. Giles
Hospital by Oldborne (now Houlborne) for ever: and other Legacies too long to
rehearse. And died in the year 1348.

Here lies Hamond Chickwell Pepperer, ^.
who had been Lord Mayor of this City, six times within nine years. And
died about the year 1328.

Here lies the body of Anne, daughter of John, Duke of Burgundy, the wife of
John Plantaginet, third son of king Henry the fourth, Duke of Bedford,
Protector of the Realm of England, and head of the common weal. Who died the
year 1433.

Here in a Monument, ^
broken all a pieces, lies entombed the body of John Neuill, Lord Latimer:
whose widow Katherine Parre, daughter of Sir Thomas Parre of Kendall, and
sister to William Lord Parre, Marquess of Northampton; was the sixth and last
wife to king Henry the eight. He died in the year 1542.

Sir John Beauchampe, ^
Constable of Dover Castle, Warden of the Cinque Ports, knight of the Garter,
and Lord Admiral of England, the second son of Guy Beauchampe, Earl of
Warwick; lies buried here in the body of the Church, within a little
Chapel. He died Ann. 1360. 34. Ed. 3.

He was also Constable of the Tower of London, as appears by ancient Records.

Upon some displeasure (upon false suggestions) which the King had taken

restored again a little before his death. For proof.

This deceased Nobleman (says Stow) by ignorant people, Suruay.
has been erroniously mistearmed, and said to be Duke Humphrey, the good
Duke of Gloucester; who lies honorably buried at S. Albans in Hertfordshire.
In Idle and frivolous opinion of whom, some men of late times, says he, have
made a solemn meeting at his Tomb, upon Saint Andrews day in the morning,
and concluded on a breakfast, or dinner, as assuming themselves to be servants,
and to hold diversity of Offices, under the said Duke Humphrey.

On the South side of the same Tomb, is this Inscription in brass.

Rich. Piriton Archdeacon of Colchester.
Hic iacet Dominus Richardus de Piriton, quondam Archidiaconus Colcestrie,

Upon the wall over the little door that enters out of Paul's into Saint
Faiths Church, is the image of Jesus, curiously painted, as also the
pourtraiture of a Lady kneeling in her mantle of Arms, with some of her
progeny. These words thereupon being most artificially pensild. Jesus our God
and Savior,
To us and ours be governor.
Which imagerie or representation was made to the memory of Margaret Countess
of Shrewsbury, who lies buried in a Chapel within that door dedicated to
the name of Jesus, with this Inscription, which not long since was there to be
read upon a pillar.

Margaret Countess of Shrewsbury.
Here, before the Image of Jesus, lies the worshipful and right noble Lady,
Margaret, Countess of Shrewsbury, late wife of the true and victorious knight,
and redoubtable warrior, John Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury: which worshipful man
died in Guien, for the right of this Land. She was the first daughter, and one
of the heirs of the right famous and renowned knight, Richard Beauchamp, late
Earl of Warwick (which died in Roan) and of Dame Elizabeth his wife. The
which Elizabeth was daughter and heir to Thomas, late Lord Berkeley, on his
side, and on her mothers side, Lady Lisle and Ties. Which Countess passed
from this world the foureteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord, 1468. On
whose soul Jesus have mercy. Amen.

I have seen a stone in the body of this Church thus inscribed, without any
name; yet Arms were upon the Monument.

Non hominem aspiciam vltra.
Obliuio.
This man yet willingly (says learned Camden) would not have been forgotten,
R^maines.
when he adjoined his Arms to continue his memory; not unlike to Philosophers
which prefixed their names before their Treatises of contemning glory.

Another, in the North Cloister now ruinated, without name, had this
Inscription upon his Graue-stone: Vixi, peccaui, penitui, Nature cessi.
Which was as Christian (says the same Author) as that was profane of the
Roman: Romans.
Amici
Dum viuimus
Viuamus.


I have read these rimes following, engraven in brass, upon a marblestone, in
the body of the Church, now stolen away.

Istuc qui graderis paulum te sistere queso
Et rogitans quid eris in me, nunc vermibus eso.
Esto memor mortis, meditare frequenter Ioua:
Mors latet in portis, non est euitabilis hora.
Effundens loculos, pro Christo despice mundum.
Clarificans oculos, vt cernas quo sit eundum.
Nam quod quisque serit presentis tempore vite,
Hoc sibi messis erit, cum dicitur, ite venite.
The slight regard of the house of God, was a maine cause of this kingdoms
subversion, as I have showed before upon the Epitaph of king Etheldred; and it
has ever been, and more especia^ly is in these our times, an use for beastly
and unclean persons, to pollute and beda^be the doors and walls of the place
where God is to be worshipped, with piss, or some other more nastie
excrements; against the like irreuerence to this goodly consecrated Edifice of
Saint Paul, diverse prohibitions upon certain penalties have been, and are
daily, published in print, and pasted up in ^^iuers places, in and about the
Church. And anciently this Atheistical vncl^^nnesse (if I may so call it) was
forbidden by a verse depicted at every door of this Church; some part of which
at the great South door is yet re^^^ning, which in my time might perfectly be
read. Thus it runs.

Hic Locus his sacer est, hic nulli mingere fas est.
This house is holy here: unlawful it is
For any one, here on her walls to piss.
And strict orders were likewise published against Beggars, and bearers of
burdens, in and through the Church: of the later sort these four lines were
sometimes fixed to a pillar, over an iron box for the poor.

All those that shall enter within the Church door,
With burden or basket, must give to the poor.
And if there be any ask what they must pay,
To this Box a penny, ere they pass away.
It could be wished, that walking in the middle Isle of Paul's might be
forborne in the time of Divine service.

Richard the second, The foundation (...) Pe^^y Canons.
king of England, Ann. Reg. 8. made the petty Canons here twelve in number, a
College, or fellowship daily to meet and diet together in one Hall; whereas
for a long time before they lived dispersedly, and could not be so ready to
serve the most Highest in their holy exercises. He appointed one John Linton
for the first Warden of this College, and gave unto the said Warden and Canons
of the foresaid Fellowship, certain lands here in London for their further
endowment, and the supporting of divine service. Charging them by his Charter
to pray for his prosperous estate living, and for his souls health when he
should depart this world: and for the soul of Anne his wife, Queen of
England: and for the souls of his and her progenitors, parents, and ancestors,
and of all the faithful people deceased.

Howsoever the Story of Brute be denied by some learned Authors, or not
permitted but by conjecture; as Seldom has it in his Illustrations upon this
verse of Michaell Drayton, which now the envious world does slander for a
dream.

Yet because I find him, in our Annals, to have been buried here in this
City, of his own foundation, as both by reason and authority it is strongly
argued by a most judicious Antiquarie of the last age; I think it not amiss to
speak somewhat of him (especially) in this place, as the truth of the story
is generally received.

Brute King of great Britain.
Brute (the son of Siluius, the son of Ascanius, who was the son of
Aeneas the warlike Trojan) being delivered from the long captivity under the
Grecians, with his wife Innogen and his people, departed from the coasts of
Greece, and arrived in an Island, where they consulted with an Oracle, sacred
to Diana. Brute himself kneeling before the Idol, and holding in his right
hand a boule prepared for sacrifice full of wine, and the blood of a white
Hind; made his imprecation to the Goddess to this effect in English.

Gildas Cambrius
Thou Goddess that do rule the woods and forests green,
And chasest foaming boares that fly thine awful sight:
Thou that may pass aloft in aerie skies so sheene;
And walk eke under earth in places void of light:
Discover earthly states, direct our course aright,
And show where we shall dwell, according to thy will,
In seats of sure abode, where Temples we may dight
For Virgins that shall sound thy land with voices shrill.
After this prayer and ceremony done, according to the Pagan rite and custom,
Brute abiding his answer, fell asleep: in which sleep appeared to him the
said Goddess uttering this answer.

Brute, far by West beyond the Gallike land is found
An Isle, which with the ocean seas enclosed is about.
Where Giants dwelt sometime, but now is desert ground,
Most meet where thou may plant thy self with all thy rout.
Make thitherwards with speed; for there thou shall find out
An euer-during seat, and Troy shall rise anew,
Unto thy race, of whom shall kings be borne, no doubt,
That with their mighty power the world shall whole subdew.
Brute was no sooner awaked then that he related this his dream or vision to
such of his company, as he thought requisite to be acquainted with such a
matter of importance; after great rejoicing and ceremonious thanksgiving, they
jointly resolved to seek out this fortunate Island, and so returned to their
ships, with great joy and gladness, as men put in comfort to find out the
wished seats for their firm and sure habitations, prophesied and promised unto
them by the Oracle; not long after Per varios casus per tot discrimina rerum.
Passing through many dangers, by sea, by land, amongst strangers:
They landed at Totnes in Devonshire, about the year of the world, 2855. and
before Christ's nativity, 1108. Of which M. Drayton Polyol. Song. 1. Mye
Britaine-sounding Brute; when with his puissant fleet
At Totnesse first he touched.
Brute having taken a view of this Island, and destroyed all such as stood
against him, commanded that the Isle should be called Brutaine (which before
was called Albion, peopled with giants) and the inhabitants thereof Britains,
or Brutaines, allusiuely after his own name. Within a short time after his
arrival, he laid the foundation of a City, which he named Troynouant, or new
Troy (now London) upon a plot of ground lying on the North side of the river of
Thames, which he built in remembrance of that noble City of Troy, from whence
he and his people were descended, as also to be the seat Royal, and chief
Chamber of his imperial kingdom. He also built a Temple to the honor of his
Pagan Gods and Goddesses. Which stood (by conjecture) in the same place where
now this Cathedral Church of Saint Paul is erected: in which idolatrous
Archflamen he bequeathed his body to be buried. Here in his new City, when he
had established certain laws, teaching his people to live after a civil
order and fashion; also to build towns and villages, to worship the Gods, to
till and plow the earth, to wear apparel, to anoint and trim their bodies:
and to be short, to live after an humane manner, and had holden the regiment of
this kingdom right nobly the space of twenty and four years, he departed
the world. Having parted his dominions into three parts, amongst his three
sons, Locrine, Camber, and Albanact: with condition, that the two younger
brethren should hold of the eldest, and to him do homage and fealty.

Brute took ship and arrived in Albion; Hard. in vi^. Bruti.

Where Diane said, should been his habitation;
And when he came the coasts of it upon,
He was full glad, and made great exultacion.
And afterward upon the alteration of the name of Albion, the building of
London, the establishing of his laws, the division of his Empire, as also of
his death and burial, the same Author has these verses.

This Brutus, thus was king in regalite,
And after his name, he called this I Will Briteyn;
And all his men by that same egalite
He called Briteynes, as croniclers all saine.
So was the name, of this ilke Albion,
All set on side, in Kalandes of a change,
And put away with great confusion,
And Briteyn hight; so forth by new exchange
After Brutus.
The city great of Troynouaunt so fair
He builded then on Thamys for his delight
Unto the North for his dwelling, and for his most repair
Which is to say in our language perfect
New Troy.
In which throughout his peace and law he set,
Which been the flowers of all regalite;
With out which, but if they two be met,
There may no Prince hold principalite,
Ne endure long in worthy dignite.
For if those two be naught vpholden than;
What is a king more worth then his liege man.
This king Brute kept well this Isle in peace;
And set his laws of Troy with orders, rites,
And consuetudes, that might the land encreace,
Such as in Troy was most profittes,
Unto the folk, and the common profettes.
He made them written for long rememory,
To rule the Isle by them perpetually.
His men he did reward full royally
With lands and rentes, that with him suffered pain*
And Troynouaunt he made full specially
An Archflaume, his sea Cathedral certain,
A Temple thereof Apolyne to opteyne
By Troyane law of all such dignite
As Archbishop has now in his degree.
This king Brutus made people fast to tylle
The land about, in places both far and nere;
And sow with sede, and get them corn full well,
To live upon, and have the sustenaunce clear,
And so in fields both far and nere;
By his wisdom, and his sapience,
He set the land in all suffycience:
And as the fate of death does assign
That needs he must his ghoost away relees
To his goddas Dyane he did resign
His corpse to be buried withouten lees
In the Temple of Apolline, to encreace
His soul among the gods euerychone
After his merits tronized high in trone.
It is said (says Sir Edward Coke to the Reader of the third part of his
Reports) that Brutus the first king of this land, as soon as he had settled
himself in his kingdom, for the safe and peaceable government of his people,
wrote a book in the Greek tongue, calling it, The Laws of the Britanes: and
he collected the same out of the Laws of the Troianes. Brute died after the
Creation, 2806. years, before the Incarnation, 1103. Samuel then Judge of
Israel.

Robert of Gloucester, my old Mss. has these rimes touching some passages in
this History of Brute.

Brute wend forth.

For to seche a fair plas to make an hau^^. ^owne.

He com and fond vpe Temese a place fair enough,

Yet so ne cleped he it naught, but for honor and joy

Locryn, and Camber, and Albanack also.
At last diede Brut. Yo this was ydo
Aftur yat he com into Engelond ye xxiiii year:

Thus much of king Brute, as the brute of him goes, and as the vulgar received
opinion is, the maine points of his story being brought into que^stion by many
of our learned authentical writers.

The Conqueror William brought with him from Roane in Normandy certain Jews,
The body of a boy found in Saint B^n^is Churchyard by Paul's Wha^fe, enshrined
afterward in this Church, who was martyred by the Jews. Stow. Annal.
whose posterity here inhabiting within the prime Cities of the kingdom, did
use sometimes to steal away, circumcise, crown with thorns, whip, torture,
and crucify some one of their neighbors male children, in mockery, despite,
scorn, and derision of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, crucified by the
Jews in Jerusalem.

In the year 1235. the 19. of Hen. the third, seven Jews were brought before
the king at Westminster, which at Norwich had stolen a boy, and kept him from
the sight of Christian people, for the space of one whole year, and had
circumcised him, minding also to have crucified him at the solemnity of
Easter, as themselves confessed before the king; whereof they were convicted,
their bodies and goods remaining at the kings pleasure.

In the 39. of the said kings reign, upon the 22. day of November; one hundred
and two Jews were brought from Lincoln to Westminster, and there accused, for
the crucifying of a child of eight years old, named Hugh: these Jews were
upon examination sent to the Tower: the murder came out by the diligent search
made by the mother of the child; eighteen of them were hanged; the other
remained long in prison.

In the seventh of Ed. the first, the Jews at Northampton crucified a
Christian boy upon Goodfriday, but did not thoroughly kill him. For the which
fact many Jews at London after Easter, were drawn at horse tails and hanged.

Not long after this, to wit, in the eighteenth year of this kings reign, all
the Jews were banished out of England, the number of which so expulsed, was
fifteen thousand and threescore persons; to whom was given no more money, but
only to bear their charges, until they were out of the kingdom. The rest,
both goods and lands, was seized upon for the Kings use.

But to return back again to the story of the martyred boy, in derogation
and despite of Christian Religion.

(...). Paris. (...). codem.
Upon the day of the Kalends of August, 1223. Ann. Reg. Hen. 3: the body of a
young boy, in the Churchyard of S. Benet at Paules-wharfe, was found buried,
under whose paps certain Hebrew letters were inscribed: upon his body diverse
prints, marks, cuts, and rents, caused by rods and whip-cords, besides many
other signs of various torments, by the said boy sustained, were easy to be
discerned. The name of the boy was found out by those Characters; and withal,
how that he was sold by his Christian parents: but by whom, or to which of the
Jews he was sold, or to what end, could never be known. Howsoever it was
concluded, that the buyers of the boy intended to have had him crucified. Yet
crucified he was not; in regard no print of the nails, either in his hands or
feet, or any wound in his side appeared. Many miracles were said to be wrought
at the grave, and by the relics of this young innocent Martyr. Whereupon the
Canons of Saint Paul's Church, took forcibly away the sacred remains of this
holy Martyr, out of the said Churchyard, and solemnly enshrined them in their
own Church, not far from the high Altar.

Pardon Churchyard. Thomas More Deane of Paul's
On the North side of this Church was sometime a great Cloister, inuironing a
plot of ground, called, Pardon Churchyard, whereof Thomas More, Deane of
Paul's, was either the first builder, or an especial benefactor, and was
therein buried.

In this Cloister were buried many persons; some of worship, and some of
honor. The Monuments of whom (says Stow in his suruay of London) in number
and curious workmanship, passed all other that were in the great Church.

About the Cloister, was artificially and richly painted the dance of Death,
Dance of Paul's
commonly called, the dance of Paul's, the Picture of death leading all estates*

Chapel in Pard^ Church yard.

Gilbert Becket Portgraue of London


In the midst of this Pardon Churchyard, was a fair Chapel, first founded by
Gilbert Becket (Portgraue and principal Magistrate (as now the Lord Mayor is)
of this City, father of Tho. Becket the Martyr, Archbishop of Canterbury) who
was therein buried; in the reign of King Stephen. Thomas More Deane of Paul's,
before mentioned, reedified, or new builded this Chapel, and founded three
Chaplains there in the reign of Henry the fifth.

Stow Sur. in Faring. Ward:
In the year 1549. on the tenth of April, the said Chapel, by commandment
of Edward Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector, was begun to be pulled down, with
the whole Cloister, the Tombs and Monuments: so that nothing of them was left,
but the bare plot of ground, which is since converted into a garden, for the
Petty Canons.

There was a Chapel at the North door of Paul's, founded by Walter
Sherington, Chapel at the North door of Paul^.
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, by license of King Henry the sixth,
for two, three, or four Chaplains, endowed with forty pound by the year.
This Chapel was also pulled down, in the reign of Edward the sixth, at the
commandment of the said Protector; and in place thereof an house builded.

There was on the North side of Paul's Churchyard, Charnell-house with our
Ladies Chapel.
a large charnell-house for the bones of the dead, and over it a Chapel,
founded upon this occasion as follows.

In the year 1282. the tenth of Edward the first, it was agreed, that Henry
Walleis, Mayor, and the Citizens, for the cause of Shops by them builded,
without the wall of the Churchyard, should assign to God, and to the Church
of Saint Paul, ten Marks of rent by the year for ever, toward the new
building of a Chapel of the blessed Virgin Mary, and also to assign five
Marks of yearly rent to a Chaplain to celebrate there.

And in the year 1430. the 8. of Henry the sixth, license was granted to
Ienken Carpenter, Towne-clerke of London (Executour to Richard Whittington) to
establish upon the said Charnell, a Chaplain to have eight Marks by the
year. There was also in this Chapel two Brotherhoods.

Sir Henry Barton knight (the son of Henry Barton of Mildenhall in Suffolcke)
Lord Mayor of London, Sir Hen. Barton Sir George Mirfin knight^ Rob Barton
in the year 1427. Robert Barton, and Sir Thomas Mirfin knight (son to
George Mirfin of Ely in Cambridgeshire) Lord Mayor of this City, the year
1518. were entombed with their pourtraitures of Alabaster over them, grated, or
coped about with iron, before the said Chapel; all which with many other
Tombs ann Monuments of the dead, were pulled down, together with the said
Chapel; at the commandment likewise of the forenamed Duke of Somerset.

The bones of the dead couched up in the Charnell-house, under the Chapel,
were conuayed from thence into Finsbery field, amounting to more then a
thousand cart load (says Stow) and there laid on a moorish ground; in short
space after raised, by soilage of the City upon them, to bear three Mills.
The Chapel and charnell-house were converted to dwelling houses, warehouses,
and sheds before them for Stationers in place of the Tombs.

Near unto this Chapel was a bell house with four Bells, Bell-house in
Paul's Churchyard.
the greatest in London, they were called Jesus Bells, and belonged to Jesus
Chapel, the same had a great spire of timber, covered with lead, with the
image of Saint Paul on the top; which was pulled down by Sir Miles Partridge
knight, in the reign of Henry the eight. The common speech then was (says
Stow) that this Sir Miles Partridge did set an hundred pound upon a cast at
dice against it, and so won the said Bell-house and Bells of the King: and
then caused the Bells to be broken as they hung, and the rest pulled down.

This Sir Miles was hanged on the Tower Hill the 26. of February, in the sixth
year of Edward the sixth, for matters concerning the Duke of Somerset:
howsoever guiltless of any offense, either against the king, or his Council,
as he took it upon his death.

There was a fair Chapel of the holy Ghost, on the North side of Paul's
Church, Holmes College.
founded in the year 1400. by Roger Holmes, Chancellor and Prebendary of
Paul's, for seven Chaplains, and called Holmes College. Their common Hall was
in Paul's Churchyard on the South side. This College was suppressed in the
reign of Ed. the sixth.

In this Chapel were buried Adam de Bury, Alderman, and Lord Mayor of London,
Adam de Bury Lord Mayor Anne Duchess of Bedford.
in the year 1364.

Anne, the daughter of John, Duke of Burgundy, the first wife of John
Plantaginet (third son of king Henry the fourth) Duke of Bedford, who died in
the year 1433.

Poultneys Chapel.
Sir John Poultney knight, four times Mayor of London, in the year 1337.
builded a fair Chapel on the North side of Paul's Church; wherein he was
buried. He founded a College in the Parish Church of Saint Laurence, Sir John
Poultney.
called Poultney. He builded the Parish Church of little Alhallowes in Thames
street, and the Carmelite Friars Church in Couentrey. He gave relief in
Newgate, and in the Fleet; and ten shillings a year to Saint Giles Hospital
by Oldborne for ever. And other Legacies (says Stow, speaking of the Honor of
Citizens) too long to rehearse. He died about the year 1348 But of him I have
spoken somewhat before.

Under the Quire of Paul's, is a large Chapel, dedicated to the name of Jesus,
Jesus Chapel.
by whom founded I do not know. But it was thus confirmed in the 37. of Hen.
the sixth, as appears by his patent thereof, dated at Crowdowne to this
effect.

Sir Alan Boxhul knight of the Garter.
Many liege-men, and Christian people, having begun a Fraternity, and Guild, to
the honor of the most glorious name of Jesus Christ our Savior, in a place
called the Crowds of the Cathedral Church of Paul's in London, which has
continued long time peaceably, till now of late. Whereupon they have made
request, and we have taken upon us the name and charge of the foundation, to
the land of Almighty God, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, and
especially to the honor of Jesus, in whose honor the Fraternity was begun,
etc.

It was likewise confirmed by Hen. the 7. the 22. of his reign, and by H. 8.
the 27. of his reign.

In this Chapel lies buried, Margaret the eldest daughter and coheire of
Richard Beauchampe, Earl of Warwick, second wife of John, Lord Talbot (the
Terror of France) first of that Surname, Earl of Shrewsbury: But of her I
have spoken before.

Many have been here interred, as John of London, under the Northroode, 1266.
John Louell; John of Saint Olaue, and Sir Allen Boxhul; with others, as you may
read in the Suruay of London. This Sir Allen Boxhul was knight of the Garter,
in Edward the thirds days, and near upon the first foundation of that
honorable order. He was Constable of the Tower, custos of the Forest, and
Park of Clarendon, the Forest of Brokholt, Grouell, and Melchet, a man highly
in favor with the said king Edward. He was buried by Saint Erkenwalds shrine;
about the year 1380. And here I think it will not be unfitting to set down
the number of the Shrines sacred to the honor of diverse Saints in the
Cathedral Church, as they stood in the year 1245.

Shrines in S. Paul's. Ex. Mss. in bib. Cot.
First, the Shrine of S. Erkenwald, which was very sumptuous, the fourth Bishop
of this See, which stood in the East part of the Church above the high Altar.

The Shrine of S. Mellitus, first Bishop of this Diocese, afterward of
Canterbury.

The Shrine of Richard Fitz-Neile, Bishop of London, Ann. 1189.

The Shrine of Egwolphe, or Egtulphe here Bishop, all beset with precious
stones, he was the seventh Bishop of this Diocese, as then called Bishop of
the East Angles. He was a learned man, and so showed himself in the
Convocation holden by Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury, Ann. 747.

There was also a glorious Shrine, super magnum Altar, but to whose holiness
dedicated I do not read.

Here sometimes was a Shrine, with a portable coffin, in the same place where
Sir William Cockaines Tomb is erected; with an Altar, built to the honor of
God, the blessed Virgin, S. Laurence, and all Saints; by one Roger Waltham,
Precentour of the Church, as did appear by this Inscription following, which
was legible, though somewhat erazed, before the erection of the foresaid
Monument.

Hoc Altar in honor Dei, and beat Virginis Marie Matris eius, ac Sancti
Laurentij Martyris, and omnium Sanctorum construxit, and hanc Voltam cum
adiacentibus picturis Martyris et Ymaginum in Septis ereis hic posuit: and cum
duabus Caglarijs suis per perpetuum.... Dominus Rogerus Waltham, huius Ecclesie
Precent........pro salute anime sue, et pro salute anime Regine...... and
omnium........ Amen.

There was likewise a Chantrie with an Altar sacred to the blessed Virgin
Mary, contiguous to the Bishops palace, and the body of the Church, founded by
Sir Gerard Braybroke knight, Edmund Hamden, John Boys, Esquires, and Roger
Albrighton, Clerk: for one Chantrie Priest daily to say Mass, and pray for
the soul of Robert Braybroke, Bishop of London, then living, and for his soul
whenever he should pass out of this world. For ^he soul of Nicholas
Braybroke, late Canon of this Church: and for the souls of all the faithful
departed. As may appear by these Deeds following, copied out of the originals,
under seal, in the custody of Sir Simonds Dewes, knight.

I gather by the premises, howsoever I may be mistaken, I confess, that the
Court of Delegates is kept at this day, in the very place of the old Chantrie.

Many Chantries, Chapels, Oratories, Altars and Shrines, more then I have
notice of, were erected, honored and founded within the spacious vast Fabric
of this Episcopal Chair: the beauty whereof is so magnificent (says
Malmesbury) that it deserves to be numbered in the rank of most excellent
Edifices. Camd. in Mid.
It contains in length six hundred and ninety foot; the breadth thereof is
one hundred and thirty foot; the height of the West arched roof from the
ground, carries an hundred and two foot: and the new Fabric from the ground
is fourscore and eight foot high. The stone-worke of the Steeple from the
plain ground rises in height two hundred and threescore foot: and the timber
frame upon the same is two hundred seventy four foot high, etc. It was no
less then five hundred and four and thirty foot high from the ground, before
that in the year of our Lord, 1087. it was set on fire with lightning, and
burnt with a great part of the City.

Nostre Dame, the Cathedral Church in Paris, is much spoken of for her
magnitude, whose dimensions are there engraven to show the greatness thereof,
in these verses following.

Si tu veux scauoir comme est ample
De Nostre Dame le grand Temple:
Il a dans oeuure pour le seur;
Dix et sept toises de haulteur,
Sur la largeur de vingt quatre^
Et soixante cinq sans rabattre,
A de long. Aux tours hault montee^
Trente quatre sont bien comptees
Le tout fond sur pilotis,
Ainsi vray que ie te le dis.
Thus, in effect, in English.

If you would know the greatness of the great Church of our Lady, the roof
thereof is seventeen fathom high; it is twenty and four fathom broad,
sixty and five fathom long; the two Steeples are thirty and four fathom
high above the Church, and all founded upon piles.

Now I leave it to my Reader (taking a fathom for an Ell) to make the
difference betwixt the ample extensure of these two religious structures.

Since the building and foundation of this Church and Bishopric of London by
King Ethelbert (which is much-what about a thousand and twenty six years ago)
eighty and nine Bishops have succeeded one another in this Hierarchy or holy
governance, which at this day is right worthily ruled, ouerseene, and guided by
the right reverend Father in God, and prudent Statesman, William La^d, one of
his Majesty's most honorable privy Council.

And thus I will take leave of this sacred Edifice, and make a few steps down
into the Parish Church of Saint Faith; commonly called, S. Faiths under Paul's;
wherein I do no find any ancient funeral Inscription much remarkable,
excepting one engraven upon the marble, which couers the body of one William
West, a Canon of Saint Paul's, a Cardinal of the same Church, a good companion,
a man universal, affable, and courteous, a Fellow of fair demeanor amongst
his Brotherhood, as he is here styled to his great commendation.

Now a word or two before I set down his Epitaph, of the title of Cardinal;
Which is derived from the Latin word Cardo, the hook or hing of a door: for
as the door hangs and depends on the hinges, so the Church on the Cardinals.
Or veluti Cardine regitur ostium, ita Ecclesia regitur bono eorum consilio: As
the door is ruled by its Hinges, so the Church is governed by their good
counsel. They are also accounted, by some, honorable increasers, Dierius and
alij.
Rulers and preseruers of all such matters which conduce to Christian piety,
and the defense of the Bishops power and authority.

In the Sea of Rome, at this day, they have the chiefest charge, and are
divided into three orders, that is to say, of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons:
not that the Cardinals Priests be no Bishops, or that the Deacons be not
Priests and Bishops, but for that their first institution was such, some to
carry the titles of Bishops, others of Priests, and some of Deacons.

The Cardinals which are Bishops, sit near unto the Pope, when he does
celebrate Festival days: The Cardinals Priests assist him when he says
Mass: and the Deacons attire him, and serve him at the Altar.

They have there their College, whereof the Pope is head; the number of them
has not been certain in our days: at this time there are about sixty and
eight; although we find that in former ages, they were but twelve, after the
example of the Apostles: They assemble themselves together once or twice a
week, as affairs of importance come to their considerations; and this their
assembly is called the Consistory; where they treat (or at least they ought to
treat) of all things* which belong unto the faith and Religion; to the peace of
Christians, and to the preservation of the temporal estate of the Church.

I find nothing of Cardinals until the days of Gregory the Great. Quo
tempore Episcopi indifferenter Cardinales faciebant, Sir Hen. Spelman. Gloss.
li^. C.
et Papa Cardinales in Episcopos promouebat. Yet some are of opinion, that the
first beginning of Cardinals was in the time of Pontianus the Pope, which was
circa Ann. 231. and Marcellus after him, circa Ann. 304. ordained fifteen, or
rather twenty five Cardinals in the City of Rome, propter Baptismata et
sepulturas hominum. And when as first these Cardinals were instituted in the
Roman Church, Pauperculi erant Romae in suis titulis habitantes. They were
poor and necessitous, living at Rome in their own titles.

And Gregory the Great, in one of his Epistles to Maximian the Bishop of
Syracusa, writes the like of the poverty of one Felix, a Deacon Cardinal. For
whose sustentation he thus prouides.

Regist. lib. 3. Epist. 14.
Sustentationem eius pietatis intuitu prouidentes, in tua Ecclesia Syracusana,
eum prenidimus cardinandum, etc. sieve vt officium Diaconatus expleat, se certe
vt solae eiusdem officij, pro sustentanda paupertate sua, commoda consequatur.

Howsoever then, that the Cardinals of Rome at this day do abound in all
affluence of riches; and like stately Cedars, look over the smaller sprigs of
the Clergy: yet considering the Primitive times, our Cardinals of Saint Paul's
are not to be contemned for their mean competencie of lively hood: having
sufficient to maintain their reverent comportment. Of whom give me leave to
speak a little out of the Records of the Church.

Cardinals of S. Paul.
The Church of Saint Paul had before the time of the Conqueror, two Cardinals,
which office still continues.

They are chosen by the Deane and Chapter, out of the number of the twelve
petty Canons, and are called Cardinales chori: the Cardinals of the Quire.

Horum officium est circumspicere quotidie and notare omnia in choro delicta
and peccata, (...) Church.
etc.

Their office is to take notice of the absence or neglect of all the Quire, and
weekly to render account thereof to the Deane and Chapter.

Hi duo etiam Cardinales Ministris Ecclesie and Seruis eorum ^um sanis t^m
egrotis Ecclesiastica ministrant Sacramenta.

These two Cardinals do minister Ecclesiastical Sacraments to the Ministers
of the Church and their servants, as well to the healthful as to the sick.

Con^essiones audiant and penitentias iniungant salutares; Mortuos postrem^
conuenientibus tradunt Sepulturis.

They hear Confessions, and appoint comfortable Penance: and lastly they
commit the dead to convenient Sepulture.

Not any Cathedral Church in England has Cardinals excepting this, neither
do I find any beyond Seas, to be dignified with this title, saving the
Churches of Rome, Rauenna, Aquileia, Millaine, Pisa, Beneuentana, in Italy, and
Compostella in Spain.

These Cardinals have the best pre-eminence in the Quire, above all, next to
the Subdeane, and the best Stalls.

But at the length let me descend into Saint Faiths, and to the Graue-stone of
my Canon and Cardinal William West.

Saint Martins Ludgate.
Our old English writers affirm, Lud King of the Britains.
that Lud King of the Britains (whom they make to be the repairer or new
builder of London) was buried much what about this place, of which these rimes
following.

Io. Harding.
With Walls fair and Towers fresh about,
His City great of Troynouant full fair,
Full well he made, and battelled throughout.
And Palace fair for Roialles to appear,
Amending other defectyue and vnfaire.
From London stone to his Now the Bishop of Londons house, says Harding.
Palace royal
That now Ludgate is known over all.
Between London stone and Ludgate forth right,
That called was then for his name Ludstone:
He made men buyld, that London then so hight;
His Palace fair, then made he then anon,
With toures high, both of lyme and stone,
Beside Ludgate; and his Temple there thereby
His God to serve, and him to glorifye.
When he had reigned by forty year all out
He died so; and in his temple fair
Entombed was with stories all about.
By another Author, more ancient, it is thus expressed.

Rob. Glocest.
Walls he let make all about, and yates up and down,
And aftyr Lud that was his name he cluped it Ludstoun.
The heyest yat of ye town yat yut stant there and is,
He let hit clupie Ludgate, after his owe name iwis:
He let him tho he was ded burye at thulk yate,
Theruore yut after him men clupeth it Ludgate.
Cadwallo K. of the Britains.
The Britains record that Cadwallo called the Valiant, King of the Britains,
after he had reigned in great honor the space of 48 years, died in peace the
12 of November, An. 677. and was buried in this place. Whose Image great and
terrible, Ge^^^ay Mon.
triumphantly riding on horseback, being artificially cast in brass, the
Britains placed here upon Ludgate, to the further fear and terror of the
Saxons; the greatness of which King is thus further expressed.

Harding.
King Cadwall reyned full hele again
In Britayne land, as prime without pere
Above English, as Lord Sovereign
Over Saxons, Scotts, and Peights clear
And English also as clear did appear.
A little more of this noble King Cadwall, out of my old Author Robert of
Gloucester.

When Cadewall king of Brutons nobly enough
Had regnyd xlviii. yer, toward his death he drogh.
He deed aftyr Martyn Mass even the sixth dey.
The Brutons made deel enough tho he ded ley,
Hii made a Kyngys toome, and him al hol with ynne
Upon an horse ridyng of bras put al with gynne.
And upon the west gate of London set hit full hegh,
In token of his noblesse that men hit fer segh.
A Chirch of Sent Martyn living he let rere.
In which yat men should goddys seruyse do,
And sing for his soul, and al Christene also.
Farewell my freyndes, John Benson and Anne his wife.
the tide abides no man,
We be departed fro hence, and so ^all ye:
But in this passage, the best song that we say can,
Is Requiem eternam, now Jesus grant hit me,
When we have endyd all our aduersitee,
Grant us in Paradise to have a mansion,
That sh^ed his blood for our redemption*
Therefore we tendyrlie requier ye,
For the souls of John Benson,
And Anne his wyff, of your charity,
To say a Pater Noster and an Aue.
These verses following were engraven in copper on the strong Quadrant of
Ludgate, built by Stephen Foster Lord Mayor, and Dame Agnes his wife, for the
relief of the Prisoners.

Devout souls that pass this way,
For Stephen Foster late Mayor hertely pray,
And Dame Agnes his Spous, to God consecrate.
That this house made for Londoners in Ludgate.
So that for lodging and water Prisoners here naught pay
As the kepers shall all ansqueare at dreadful Doomys day.

The chief Foundresse of this religious house is said to be Queen Margaret,
The foundation of Christ-Church or the Friars Minorites.

to the building of some part of the Church; glased all the windows on the
south side, and also gave many rich Jewels and ornaments to be used in the
same, so that he is accounted as a second Founder.

Diverse other Noble men and worthy Citizens, gave both lands and great sums
of money toward the building and endowing of this religious Structure; which
was finished within 21 years, dedicated to the honor of God, and our alone
Savior Jesus Christ, and replenished with gray Friars Minorites; valued at the
general suppression but at 32 l. 19 s. 10 d.

This Abbey Church has been honored with the sepulture of four Queens,
four Dutchesses, four Countesses, one Duke, two Earls, eight Barons, and
some thirty five Knights; whose names are set down by Stow in his Suruay of
this honorable City; ^^gist Frat. Mi^. Mss. in bib C^t.
and in all, from the first foundation unto the dissolution, six hundred
sixty and hree persons of Quality were here interred. In the Quire were nine
Tombs of Alabaster and Marble, environed with bars or strikes of iron: one
Tomb in the body of the Church coped also with iron, and seauenscore
graue-stones of Marble in diverse places; all which were pulled down, taken
away, and sold for fifty pounds or thereabouts, by Sir Martin Bows Mayor of
London, An. 1545. The rest of the Monuments are now wholly defaced, not any one
remaining at this day, save such which are of later times.

This House was founded by Robert Kilwardby Archbishop of Canterbury, and the
Citizens of London, An. Dom. 1276. This Archbishop, toward the latter end of
his time, made a collection, says Godwin, for the building of a Monastery for
the Friar Minors in London. Many contributed so largely thereunto, as he
(having the help of a certain old Tower which yielded him stones without
charge) finished the same with other men's money, and was able to afford the
foundation for another at Salisbury. King Edward the first and Eleanor his
wife, were great Benefactors to this work. This was a large Church, richly
furnished with ornaments, and honored by the burials of many great Personages:
diverse Parliaments and other great meetings have been holden in this
Monastery, which is now altogether demolished, and other new buildings erected
in the same place. This order of black Friars Predicants were removed hither
from Oldbourne, where they had continued 55 years. The reuenewe of this house
was valued at 104 l. 15 s. 5 d per annum, being surrendered into the Kings
hands, 12 of November, the 30 of Henry the 8.

Survey of London.
Persons of kingly, princely, and noble descent, of eminent high place and
quality, to the number of fifty and upwards are reckoned by Io. Stow (out of
the Register of this house) to have bin here entombed, to whose relation I
leave my Reader, only give me leave to speak of one.

Upon a Table fastened to a pillar, this inscription was not long since here to

Here lies the body of the Lady Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir Bartholomew
Balitismere, wife of William Bohun, Earl of Northampton, and mother of the
Earls of March and Northampton, and of Elizabeth, Countess of Arundell. She
died 5 Id. of June, Anno Christi 1378. She was interred before the high Altar.

Nicholas Faringdon Goldsmith, four times Lord Mayor of this City, lies
intombed; he was the son of William Faringdon Sheriff of the same. Of which
two Faringdons the two Wards within, and without, took their denominations.

three and fifty years.

Saint Martins.
The Foundation of S. Martins.
Nere unto Aldersgate was sometime a fair and large College, of a Deane and
secular Canons, or Priests, consecrated to the honor of Saint Martin, and
called Saint Martins le graund: founded by Ingelricus, and Edward his brother,
In Arch turris London.
in the year of Christ 1056. and confirmed by William the Conqueror, as
appears by his charter dated 1068. This College claimed great privileges of
sanctuary, and other Franchises, as appears in a book written by a Notary
of that house, Lib. S. Martin.
circa An. 1442. This College was surrendered to King Edward the sixth in the
second of his reign, Stow Sur.
and in the same year, the College Church was pulled down, and a
Wine-Tauerne built in the place, which continues to this day.

Here lies buried (says Stow) the head of James the fourth, King of Scots,
whose body bowelled, rebollowed, embalmed and enclosed in lead, was conuayed
from Flodden Field (where he was slain in battle, The head of James the 4.
king of Scotland. Stow. Annal.
the ninth of September being Friday, 1513.) by Thomas Howard, Earl of Surry,
Lieutenant General of the English Army, to this City of London, presented to
Queen Katherine, and from hence sent to the Monastery of Shine in Surrey,
where it was regally interred. Since the dissolution of which house, in the
days of king Edward the sixth, I have been showed (says he) the same body
so wrapped in lead, Suruay Land.
thrown into a waste room, amongst old timber, stone, lead, and other rubble:
and further (to show the occasion of the burial of his head, here in this
Church) he declares, that the servants of Lancelot Young, Glasier to the late
Queen Elizabeth, being at Shine, in new glasing the windows, either upon a
foolish pleasure, or desire of the lead, cut the head from the rest; but
smelling the sweet perfumes of the balmes, gave it to their Master; who
opening the head, found therein the head of a man retaining favor; though the
moisture were clean dried up, whose hair both of Head and Beard was red:
which, after he had well viewed, and a while kept, he caused to be buried in
Saint Michaels Woodstreet, London, the Church of the Parish wherein himself
dwelled.

That the Head of this valorous King lies here inhumed, we must believe the
words of the Relator; for I find no Monument or outward appearance of it in the
Church. That his body (not found till the day after the battle, and then not
known or descried, because of his many wounds, save only by the Lord Dacres)
was interred amongst the Carthusians in the Priory of Shine at Richmond, I
have, out of an old Manuscript, the testimony of a man which saw his Sepulcher,
the same year of his death in the said religious house: these are his words,
out of the Lieger book of Whalley Abbey.

Lib. Monasterij de Whalley in Com. Lanc.
Anno Domini M.VC.XIII. Hoc anno Iacobus Scotie Rex in Borea triumphaliter ab
Anglis (Rege Henrico valido exercitu contra Gallos vltra Mare debellante)

euulsum de hoc mundo abcesserit) huc vsque in domo Cartusiensium apud Rychmund
mortalibus miserandum spectaculum inhumatum iacet. Qui vidit testimonium
perhibuit
Et verum est testimonium eius:
Yet notwithstanding all this, John Lesley, Io. Lesle in vil. Iac. 4.
Bishop of Rosse, affirms that it was held for certain, that the body thus
found by the Lord Dacres, was the body of the Lord Bonehard, then slain in
the battle: and that King James was seen alive the same night at Kelso,
whence he passed to Jerusalem, and there spent the rest of his days in holy
contemplation. And another of later times also affirms the place of this
kings burial to be as yet unknown. Remains, pa. 371.
King Henry the eight (says he) who subverted so many Churches, Monuments and
Tombs, lies inglorious at Windsor, and never had the honor, either of the
Tomb which he had prepared, or of any Epitaph that I now remember. But his
Brother in law King James the fourth of Scotland, slain at Flodden, though the
place of his burial is unknown, yet had this honorable Epitaph.

Fama orbem replet, mortem sors occulit, at tu
Desine scrutari quod tegit ossa solum.
Si mihi dent animo non impar fata Sepulchrum,
Augusta est tumulo terra Britanna meo.
And John Ionston in his Historical Inscriptions of the Scottish Kings,
confirms the same opinion of the uncertainty of the place of this Kings
interrement. Read, if you please, the verses of that worthy man (Professor of
Divinity in the University of Saint Andrews Scotland) to the same effect;
and greatly in this kings commendation.

Shanke bone of 28. inches long.
In the Cloister about this Churchyard, hanged and fastened to a post is the
shanke-bone of a man, wondrous great, and large, in length 28. inches and a
half, of assise: with the pourtraiture of a Giant-like person, upon a Table,
with this Inscription.

In wise men's sight I seem not strange,
Although some friends of Pan will scorn;
From time to time all shapes will change,
Full well appears since the firstborn.
Deride not that which naught offends,
Let reason rule, strong men have been;
As Sampson tall; lo death all ends:
In Stories past may well be seen.
Cam^en in Cornwall.
If you trust our Stories, you must believe that Giants, or men of vaste bodily
composture, inhabited this our Island in former times. Of whom one Hauillan a
Poet, who flourished above four hundred years since, wrote pleasantly in this
wise, thus translated out of the Latin tongue.

In Cornwall
There Giants whilome dwelt, whose clothes were skins of beasts,
Whose drink was blood; whose cups, to serve for use at feasts,
Were made of hollow wood; whose beds were bushie thorns;
And Lodgings rockie caves, to shelter them from storms.
Their chambers craggie rocks, their hunting found them meat.
To ravish and to kill, to them was pleasure great.
Their violence was rule, with rage and fury led,
They rusht into the fight, and fought hand over head.
Their bodies were interred behind some bush or brake:
To bear such monstrous wights, the earth did groan and quake.
These pesterd most the Western tract: more fear made thee aghast,
O Cornwall, utmost door that art to let in Zephyrus blast.
And the vulgar received opinion is, that Brute upon his first arrival in
Kent, was encountered with diverse strong and mighty Giants. Of which an Author
of reverend good antiquity thus writes: as also of the wrestling betwixt
Corineus and Gogmagog.

R^b Glocest.
There was a Geant het Gogmagog, yat was great and strong,
For about ane twenty fet men says.
seiy yat he was long:
A good oak he would braye a down as hit small yerde were;
And bear hit forth in his hond ye folk all to a fere.
wi^h.
He com wiy xx Geants and assayllede Brute fast,
Brut wiy his power hem slough echon at last,
All but Gogmagog, for him ne slough he naught,
For he should wiy Corneus wrestle by his thought.
In a word, my Author makes Corineus to get the upper hand of Gogmagog, and to
cast him headlong from one of the rocks not far from Dover, which for a long
time was called the fall or leap of Gogmagog, Gogmagog the last Giant.
and afterward the fall of Dover. And this Gogmagog, says he, was the last of
that monstrous generation.

Raph the Monk of Coggeshall who wrote above three hundred years ago, says,
that in king Richards time, on the sea shore at a Village in Essex, called
Eadulphnesse, were found two teeth of a certain Giant, of such an huge
bigness, that two hundred such teeth, as men have now a days, might be cut
out of them. These saw I at Goggeshall (quoth he) and not without wondering. And
such another Giant-like thing, I wot not what, says Camden, Camd. in Essex.
was in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, dug up by R. Candish, a
Gentleman near to this place. Upon which thus he does further comment.

I do not deny (says he) but that there have been men, that for their huge
bodies, and firm strength, were wondrous to behold; whom God, as Saint Austin
says, would have to live upon the earth: thereby to teach us, that neither
beauty of body, nor talenesse of stature, are to be accounted simply good
things, seeing they be common, as well to Infidels, as to the godly. Yet may we
very well think, that which Suetonius has written, namely, that the huge
limbs of monstrous Sea-creatures elsewhere, and in this kingdom also, were
commonly said and taken to have been Giants bones.

Another judicious Antiquarie of these times does also thus illustrate this
point. Seldom in his Illu^^r^tions, Polyol. Song 1.
I could think, says he, that there now are some as great statures, as for
the most part have been; and that Giants were but of a somewhat more then
vulgar excellence in body, and martial performance. If you object the finding
of great bones, which measured by proportion largely exceed our times. I first
answer, that in some singulars, as Monsters rather then natural, such proof
has been; but that now and of ancient time, the eyes judgment in such like
has been, and is, subject to much imposture, mistaking bones of huge beasts
for humane. Claudius brought over his Elephants hither, and perhaps Julius
Caesar some (for I have read that he terriblie frighted the Britons, with sight
of one at Coway Stakes, when he passed over Thames) and so may you be
deceived. But more of Giants hereafter.

Guild Hall Chapel.
This Chapel or College of our Lady, The foundation of the Collegiate
Chapel at Guildhall.
Mary Magdalen, and of all Saints, was founded about the year 1299. by Peter
Fanclore, says Stow, Adam Francis, and Henry Frowike, whose reuenew was much
augmented by K. Richard the second, K. Henry the sixth, and diverse citizens of
London; so that at the suppression it was endowed with sufficient maintenance,
for a Custos, seven Chaplains, three Clerks, and four Quiristers, at which
time it was valued at xii l xviij s ix d per an. Here have been many Tombs,
and marble stones inlaid with brass; whose inscriptions and portraitures are
all either worn out with time, torn out, or quite defaced, only this Epitaph
remaining.

Long prosperity
To Charles and Henry,
Princes most puissant
The one of the Faith,
The other of the Church
Chosen defendant.
These verses were depicted, Hollins.
here and in other places about this City, the year 1514. when Charles the
fifth Emperor was here in England; to show in what golden bands of love these
two potent Monarchs were enlinked; for that amongst other covenants (then
concluded and confirmed betwixt them by corporal Oaths) one was, that the
Emperor promised to stay for, and take to wife the young Princess Lady Mary,
King Henry's then only daughter, afterward Queen of England.

Why the Titles, Speed Hist.
defender of the Church and Faith, were attributed unto these two Princes, is
vulgarly known, because Charles chosen Emperor, to purchase the Popes
favor, directed forth a solemn Writ of Outlawry against Martin Luther, who
then had given a great blow to the Papal Crown; And King Henry likewise was
renowned in Rome, for writing a book against the said Luther; underpropping
the tottering or downe-cast countenance of the Popes Pardons, which Luther
shrewdly had shaken. The Pope therefore, to show himself a kind Father unto
these his sons, gave them these Titles; which were in truth none other, then
the same which they swear unto, when the Crowns of their Empires were first
set upon their heads.

The Hospital of Saint Tho. of Acars, or Mercers Chapel.
Foundation of Mercers Chapel.
This Hospital was founded by Thomas Fitz-theobald de Heili, and Agnes his
wife, Sister to Thomas Becket Archbishop of Canterbury, in the reign of Henry
the second, and dedicated to Saint Thomas of Acon or Acars in the holy land.
They gave to the Master and Brethren of this house, the lands with the
appurtenances, that sometimes were Gilbert Beckets, father to the said Thomas,
in the which he was born, there to make a Church. This Hospital was valued at
the suppression to dispend yearly 277 l. 3 s. 4 d. it was surrendered the 30 of
Henry the 8. the 21 of October, and was since purchased by the Mercers, Stow.
by means of Sir Richard Gresham.

Camden in the County of Tipperary. Ireland.
The Ancestors of these Earls (says learned Camden) were in old time the
Butlers (an honorable office) in Ireland, and from thence came this Surname Le
Boteler or Butler imposed upon them* and certain it is that they were linked
in most near alliance unto Saint Thomas Becket Archbishop of Canterbury (as
who derive their descent from his sister) (which was a great motive to make
them choose this place for their burial) and that after he was murdered,
Becket was borne near to this Church, here he had a shrine, and his picture
over the Chapel door.
they were by King Henry the second removed into Ireland, who supposed that he
should disburden himself of the worlds hatred, for that fact, in case he
advanced the Kinsfolk and Allies of the said Thomas to rich revenues, and high
honors.

The first Earl of Ormond (says he) in this family, was James, son to
Edmund, Earl of Caricke, who wedded the daughter of Humphrey Bohun Earl of
Hereford, whom he had by a daughter of King Edward the first. And here was his
first step unto this honor; hereupon James his son by this marriage, came to
be commonly named among the people, The noble Earl. The fifth Earl of these
named James (that I may not stand particularly upon euere one) received at the
hands of King Henry the sixth, the title and honor of Earl of Wiltshire, to
him and to the heirs of his body, who being Lord Deputy of Ireland, as diverse
others of this race, and Lord Treasurer of England; standing attainted by King
Edward the fourth, was straight ways apprehended and beheaded: but his
brethren, John and Thomas likewise proclaimed Traitors, kept themselves close
out of the way. John died at Jerusalem without issue. Thomas here entombed,
through the special favor of King Henry the seventh, was in the end restored
to his blood, who departed this life, (as before in his Epitaph.) An. 1515.
leaving behind him two daughters, Anne married to Sir James de Sancto
Leodegario, called commonly Sellenger, and Margaret unto Sir William Bullein,
who bare unto him Sir Thomas Bollein, whom King Henry the eight created first
Viscount Rochford, afterward Earl of Wiltshire and Ormund, the father of Anne
Bollein, as I have written before.

This Lord Mayor, (who for his singular wisdom was made a Privy Counselor
to King Henry the eight) built a beautiful Chapel here, wherein he was first
buried, Stow Suruay.
but since, his Tomb is removed thence into the body of the Hospital Church,
and his Chapel divided into Shops. He gave to the city a rich collar of gold,
to be worn by the Mayor; he gave a stock of 500 marks to be employed for the
use of the poor of London; besides the rents of certain lands by him
purchased of the King. To Prisons, Hospitals, and Lazer houses within, and two
miles without the City, he was abundantly charitable.

Play at Skinners Hall, Corpus Christi play.
which lasted eight days (says Stow) to hear which, most of the greatest
Estates of England were present. The Subject of the play was the sacred
Scriptures, from the creation of the world* They call this, Corpus Christi Play
in my country, which I have seen acted at Preston, and Lancaster, and last of
all at Kendall, in the beginning of the reign of King James; for which the
Townsmen were sore troubled; and upon good reasons the play finally suppressed,
not only there, but in all other Towns of the kingdom.

own house by Wat. Tyler and other Rebels, and by them beheaded in Cheap, the
year 1381.

Not many years since, here stood a monument in the North wall, erected to the
memory of Sir George Stanley, Knight of the Garter, and Lord Strange (in right
of his wife Joan, daughter and heir of John Lord Strange of Knocking) son
and heir of Thomas Stanley, Lord Stanley of Lathum in Lancashire and Earl of
Derby: which George died before his Father at Derby house (now the Heralds
Office) Anno 1487. the third of Henry the seventh. And near to the same place
Elianor his mother Countess of Derby, the daughter of Richard Neuill Earl of
Salisbury, was likewise entombed. This Church was honored with the monuments
of many worthy personages, of which no mention is now remaining.

Saint Michaels Pater Noster in the Royal.
This Church was new builded, The Foundation of Whittin^^on C^lledge and
Hospital.
and made a College of S. Spirit and S. Mary, founded by Richard Whitington
Mercer four times Mayor, for a Master, four Fellows, Masters of Art,
Clerks, Conducts, Quiristers, etc. and an Alms house, called Gods house, or
Hospital for thirteen poor men, one of them to be Tutor, and to have xvi.d.
the week, the other twelve, each of them to have xiiij. d. the week for ever,
with other necessary provisions. These were bound to pray for the good estate
of Richard Whitington and Alice his wife, their Founders, and for Sir William
Whitington Knight, and Dame Joan his wife, and for Hugh Fitz-Warren, and Dame
Maud his wife, the Fathers and Mothers of the said Richard Whitington, and
Alice his wife; Stow Survey.
for King Richard the second, and Thomas of Woodstocke, Duke of Gloucester,
special Lords and promoters of the said Richard Whitington. The license for
this foundation was granted by King Henry the fourth, the eleventh of his
reign, and confirmed by King Henry the sixth, the third of his reign. This
Richard Whitington (says my Author Stow) was three times buried in this his
own Church: first by his Executors under a fair monument, then in the reign
of Edward the sixth; the Parson of the Church thinking some great riches (as he
said) to be buried with him, Richard Whit^ing thrice buried.
caused his monument to be broken, his body to be spoiled of his leaden sheet,
and again the second time to be buried. And in the reign of Queen Mary, the
Parishioners were forced to take him up, to lap him in lead as before, to bury
him the third time, and to place his monument or the like over him again:
whereupon this Epitaph is engraven, partly erazed and imperfect.

This Whitington flourished in the reign of King Richard the second. Henry the
fourth, Henry the fifth, and died about the beginning of Henry the sixth, having
begun to build Newgate, and the Library of Gray Friars at Christ Church,
London, with that at Guild hall; all which were finished by his Executors, with
his goods. His College here, was suppressed by the Statute of Edward the sixth:
the Alms houses, with the poor men, do remain to this day, and are paid by
the Mercers.

Here lies entombed in a Chapel of his own foundation, Sir William Walworth
Knight, Lord Mayor of London, whose manfull prowess against that arch-Rebell
VVat Tyler and his confederates, is much commended in our English Chronicles:
his monument was shamefully defaced in the reign of King Edward the sixth (as
many others were) but since it was renewed by the Fishmongers, he died, Anno
1383. as appears by this Epitaph.

Here under lyth a man of Fame,
William Walworth called by name,
Fishmonger he was in life time here,
And twice Lord Mayor as in books appear,
Who with courage stout and manly might,
Slew Wat Tyler in King Richards sight.
For which act done and true intent,
The King made him Knight incontinent.
And gave him arms, as here you see,
To declare his fact and Chivalry.
He left this life the year of our God,
Thirteen hundryd fourscore and three od.
John Philpot, Nicholas Brember, and Robert Launde Aldermen, were knighted with
him the same day; To this Mayor, the King gave 100 pound land yearly, and to
each of the other 40 pound land by year, to them and their heirs for ever.

He founded a College to this parish Church, for a Master and nine Priests or

for a Master and a Chaplain; the which Chapel and Parish Church was made a
College of Jesus, and of Corpus Christi, for a Master and seven Chaplains, by
John Poultney Mayor, and was confirmed by Edward the third, in the twentieth of
his reign. So that of him it was called, Saint Laurence Poultney, in
Candlewickstreet. This College was valued at 79. l. 17. s. 11. d. per ann. and

and others, to found a brotherhood of S. Katherine in this Church, to the help
of Gods service; because Thomas Becket and S. Edmund, Archbishops of
Canterbury, were baptized herein.

Alhallowes Barking.
On the North side of this Church was sometime builded a fair Chapel, The
foundation of our Ladies Chapel of Barking.
founded by king Richard the first, and much augmented by king Edward the
first. Edward the fourth gave license to his cousin John, Lord Tiptost, Earl of
Worcester, to found here a Brotherhood for a Master and Brethren: And he gave
to the Custos of that Fraternity, the advowsion of the Parish Church of
Stretham in Surrey, with all the members and appurtenances; the Priory of
Totingbeck, and a part of the Priory of Okeborne in Wiltshire, both Priors
Aliens, and appointed it to be called, the Kings Chantrie, In Capella beat
Marie de Barking, king Richard the third founded herein a College of Priests;
and reedified the decayed structure. Great concourse of people came hither to
our Lady of Barking a pilgrimage; until the College was suppressed and pulled
down, in the second of Edward the sixth, and the ground whereupon it stood,
employed as a Garden plot.

Many funeral Monuments are yet remaining in this Parish Church, which you may
read in the Suruay of this City.

This Sir John Arundell was of the house of Lanherne in Cornwall, a family of
great respect in that county. Of which I shall have further occasion to speak
when I come to Saint Columbs, where this man's Ancestors lie entombed. The

Saint Peter's Cornhill.
Be hit known to al men, An Inscription upon a table sometime chained in this
Church.
that the yeerys of owr Lord God an clxxix. Lucius the first christen king of
this land, then called Brytayne, fowndyd the first church in London, that is to
sey, the Church of Sent Peter upon Cornhyl, and he fowndyd there an
Archbishoppys See, and made that Chirch the Metropolitant, and cheef Chirch of
this kingdom, and so enduryd the space of cccc yeerys, and more; unto the
coming of Sent Austen, an Apostyl of England, the which was sent into the
land, by Sent Gregory, the Doctor of the Chirch, in the tym of king Ethelbert,
and then was the Archbishoppys See and Pol removyd from the aforeseyd Chirch of
S. Peter's upon Cornhyl, unto Derebernaum, that now is called Canterbury, and
there yt remeynyth to this dey. And Millet Monk which came in to this land with
Sent Austen was made the first Bishop of London, and his See was made in
Powllys Church. And this Lucius king was the first Fowndyr of Peter's Church
upon Cornhyl. And he regnyd king in this Ilond aftyr Brut, M.cc.xl.v. yeerys.
And the yeerys of owr Lord god a cxxiiii. Lucius was crownyd king, and the
yeerys of his reygne lxxvii yeerys, and he was beryd aftyr sum cronekil at
London, and aftyr sum cronekil, he was beryd at Glowcester, at that plase where
the ordyr of Sent Francys standyth.

The truth of this Inscription is questioned in diverse points by some of the
learned Senate of our Ecclesiastical Historians, but I will adhere to the
common received opinion, that Lucius was the first Christian king of this
Island, and indeed of the world, that he founded an Archbishops See here in
London: Malmes. lib 1. de Pont. 1. Seldom.
after which time Christianity was always professed in some part of this
kingdom, and especially in Wales. Of which, if it be not troublesome, read
these old rimes.

Rob Glocest.
Among ye Brutons in Walys was always Christendom,
Sitthe hit furst thurghe Lucye Brutons king hit com:
And that was tofore Sent Austens time a cccc yer
And about xxiiii, as they writ of er.
Iocelin of Fournes seith, that one Thean was the first Archbishop, and the
first builder of this Church, by the help of one Cyran, chief Butler unto
king Lucius.

Eluanus was the second, who built a Library near unto his Church, and
converted many of the British Druides (learned men in the Pagan law) to
Christianity. The rest until you come to Restitutus, who was the 12.
Archbishop, are but only named in my Author.

Cadar.
Restitutus (says Bishop Godwin) was at the Council of Arles in France, the
year 326. O^i^us.
under Constantius the son of Constantine the great, Conan.
and subscribed unto the Decrees of the same Council, Palladius.
which he brought over with him. Stephanus.
One Decree amongst the rest was, that if a Deacon at the time of his ordering,
Il^ut.
did protest he intended to marry, Dedwin.
it should be lawful for him so to do. Thedred.
Restitus himself was married. One Kebius (the son of Solomon, Hillary.
a certain Duke of Cornwall) Bishop of Anglesey in Wales, Restitutus.
Harpsfeeld Sex. prim. secul c. 16.
flourished in his days, and traveled with him into France; and afterward,
went himself into Ireland: where, by his good doctrine, he converted many of
that Nation to Christianity.

Gwitelin. or Guitelnius.
Guitelnius the thirteenth Archbishop, traveled over Seas to the king of
little Britain, to crave his aid against the Scots and Picts, which mightily
infested this kingdom, insomuch that the Romans rather chose to remit the
Britains their tribute, then to afoard them any more aid. Of which, this
Bishop made an oration to his countriemen a little before his departure, who at
that time (like the Romans) were wearied out with their often incursions, and
altogether afraid to encounter with the enemy, that fierce valiant Scot. Scots
ever valiant.
Imagine his words were wondrous old, from our times, and that they were
delivered in this Dialect.

Rob. Glocest.
All ye great of this land to London ycome
Therchbishop thus sede Gwithelin benome.
Our leave friends of Rome her to speak to yough me bid,
But beter will ich have to weep, then to do any othur deed:
For pite hit is of this land, and of our wretchede.
Aftur that Maximian our folk a wey began led,
All our knights, and our Swayn, and much of our young head,
And othur lands storede therwyth, alas the deolfull deed.
And ye beth men bet ytaught to shouele, and to spade,
To cart, eke, and to plough, and to a fishyng wade;
To hamer, and to nedle, and othur crafts also.
Than with sper or with swerd battle for to do.
When your enemies comes you ne kunneth but fle,
As shep before UUolues, hough might more woo be
And the Sea biset you al abowte, hough mow ye than by thenche
Othur ligge a don and be a slawe, othur fle, and a drenche,
Help is there nan with you, but clenlich all this land,
All the helpyng and lokyng is in othur man's hand.
And the Romans beth anoyed of hure traualle so sore,
Of perile of See and land ek, hii wole come here no more.
Hii wolleth hure truage rather leave, that ye berith him a year,
Be konne ye naught lerny thing that ye deed never ere?
Applies yowr hondes to the sper and to the swerd also,
For strongur men buth there none, and ye would turn thereto
Me sees a bond man's sone somtym a knight bycome,
And of a grom a Squire, and aftur knyghts some:
And such ye haueth the form of men, beth men in all wise,
And torneth you to Manhede, and keeps your Franchise.
So it follows how this Bishop went into little Britain, and entreated
Aldroennus the king there, to send over Constantine his brother, with a
certain number of men, by whose help the enemy might be expelled, which was
granted, and performed accordingly.

Fastidius Priscus succeeded him in the government of this See, Fastidius
Priscus 4. cent. 1.
who writ diverse books of divine learning, mentioned by Bale. He was a
sincere expositor of the sacred Scriptures, and a painful Preacher throughout
the whole kingdom. Cui abunde suppeditebant, cum perbenigno ingenio excellens
memoria: morum integritas et vita incorrupta, quibus cumulatissime caeteros
suae gentis praecedebat verbi Praecones. He flourished under Honorius and
Theodosius Emperors, Ternckine 15. Lib. in bib. Cott. Mss. Vedinus 16.
420. By an old namelesse Chronicle which I have read, one Ternekine succeeded
Fastidius, a piercing wise Prelate into matters of state, and in special
favor with Aurelius Ambrose King of great Britain: but Vodinus follows next
in the catalogue, a man of singular devotion and good life, who for
reprehending King Vortigers unlawful marriage with Rowenna, Hengists daughter
(his lawful wife being then living) was barbarously murdered by the said
Hengist, and with him many other Priests, and religious Persons, circa an. 452.

After the coming of the Saxons, Godwin de praeful. Ang.
the succession of Archbishops was still continued in London for the space of
many years (but secretly) even until the time that S. Gregory sent Augustine
hither. I find only one of them named, to wit,

Theonus who with Thadiocus or Tadiacus (of which I have spoken before in
Rochester) Bishop of York, Theon the last Archbishop.
taking their Clergy with them, got them into Wales and Cornwall, to the rest
of their countrymen, whom the Saxons had lately driven thither: this man did
not write himself Archbishop, which is one cause of some controversy amongst
our Historiographers.

And the new morrow springs again as fast,

So full of change is of this world the glory.

Hic..... Willielmus Capel.... Mayor Lon: Sir William Capell Lord Mayor.

Capel... Neyland in com.... ob.... 1509.
Out of this broken Inscription I find this whole history how that Sir Richard
Empson Knight (a Sieue-makers son in Tocester) and Edmund Dudley Esquire,
both Lawiers, were two instruments for King Henry the seventh, to enrich his,
and their own coffers; and to empouer^sh the subjects, by way of calling the
richer sort into question, for breach of old, moth eaten, vnreuiued penal
Laws; amongst many others (whom they most treacherously abused, by a false
packt Jury) they scruzed from this Sir William Capell above sixteen hundred
pounds, and some twelve or thirteen years after, they were at him again
afresh, for two thousand pounds more; which because he would not pay, he was
commanded, by Dudley, Prisoner to the Tower; but by the death of the said King
(which happened the same year) he was released both of imprisonment and
payment, in which year he also departed this world, in the love of all good
men, leaving a great inheritance, and an honorable remembrance to his
posterity; and not long after, Empson and Dudley (cater-pillers of the
commonwealth, hateful to all good people) were beheaded on the Tower hill the
17. of August 1510. leaving behind them nothing they could dispose of for
their heirs, save the stain of everlasting infamy.

He lies here entombed in a Chapel of his own Foundation; he was the son
of John Capell of Stoke Neyland in the county of Suffolk.

Within this Parish was the Hospital of Saint Anthony, The foundation of Saint
Anthonies Hospital.
sometime a cell belonging to Saint Anthonies of Vienna, founded by King Henry
the third, for a Master, two Priests, one Schoolmaster, and twelve poor men:
the revenues of this house were much augmented, and the number of the household
increased by King Henry the sixth, and Edward the fourth, to which John Tate
Mercer was a right bountiful benefactor, who was here entombed under a fair
monument, he died Anno 1514. and so was Water Champion Sheriff of London,
1529. who was here buried.

The lands, by year, of this Hospital, were valued in the 37. year of Henry
the eight, to be 55 l. six shillings, 8 d.

Stow in his Suruay says, that one Johnson, Schoolmasters of this Hospital,
and Prebend of Windsor, spoiled both the School and Hospital, and the Quire
of the Church, conuayed away the Plate and ornaments, then the Bells, and lastly
put out the Almesmen from their houses, appointing them xii d. the week to
each person. The Church of this Hospital is now a preaching place for the
French Nation.

The foundation of the Augustine Friars.
This religious house was founded (in the well meaning devotion of former times)
by Humphrey Bohun the fifth of that name, Earl of Hereford and Essex, 1253. and
was afterward reedified by Humphrey Bohun, the ninth of that name, Earl of
Hereford and Essex, Lord of Brecknocke, and Constable of England, who died Anno
1361. and was buried in the Quire of this Church. This Frierie (dedicated to
the honor of Saint Augustine) was valued upon the surrender to King Henry the
eight, to 57 l. 4 s. per annum.

Ri^hard Earl of A^undell.
Here sometime did lie entombed the body of Richard Fitz-Alan, the fourth of
that name, Earl of Arundell and Surrey, who with Thomas Duke of Gloucester,
Thomas Earl of Warwick, Henry Earl of Derby, afterward King of England, and
others, combined and swear each to other, against Robert Vere, Duke of Ireland,
and Michael de la Pole Duke of Suffolk, for abusing and misleading the King;
for which and some other causes which Richard the second objected against them,
some of them were banished, others condemned to perpetual imprisonment: and
this Richard beheaded on the Tower hill, September. Anno 1397. the constancy of
whose carriage at his arraignement, passage and execution (in all which he did
not once discolor the honor of his blood with any degenerous word, look, or
action) increased the envy of his death upon his prosecutors.

John Vere Earl of Oxford* and Aubrey his son.
Here likewise lay sumptuously interred, John Vere the xii. Earl of Oxford, and
Aubrey his eldest son, who with Sir Thomas Tudensa knight, (who was also here
buried) and others their Counselors (either through malice of their enemies,
or some offense conceived by King Edward the fourth) were attainted by Act of
Parliament, anno primo Edward 4, and put to Execution upon the Tower hill, the
26 of February, 1461.

William Lord Berkeley of Berkeley Castle; (...) his wife
honored with the t^t^es of Viscount, and Marquess Berkely, Earl of
Nottingham, and Earl Marshall of England, was here inhumed; who died, Ann.
1492.

This William (as I had it from my deceased friend, Mss.
Aug. Vincent) by his deed dated the third of November, Ann. 6. Hen. 7 gave one
hundre^ pounds to the Prior of this house, for two Masses to be said presently,
and for ever, at the Altar of our Lady, and Saint James. Between which Altars
the body of his wife Joan (who lived but a few days with him, and is not at
all mentioned in the Catalogues of Honor) was buried, who was the widow of Sir
William Willoughbie, before the marriage with the Marquess. And to pray for
the prosperous estate of the said Marquess, and of Anne his then wife, and of
Edward Willoughby, Richard Willoughby, Anne Beauchampe, and Elisabeth
Willoughbie, with all the issue of the said William and Ioane; and especially
for the souls health of the said Ioane, and of Katherine her mother, Duchess
of Norfolk.

Here sometime lay sumptuously entombed, (...) Duke (...).
the body of Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham; who by the sleights and
practices of Cardinal Wolsey, fell into displeasure with king Henry the eight;
and being condemned of high Treason, for that (among other matters) he had
consulted with a Monk (or wizard) about succession of the Crown, was beheaded
on the Tower hill, May the 17. 1521. He was a noble Gentleman, exceedingly much
lamented of good men. Of whose death, when the Emperor Charles the fifth
heard, he said that a Butchers dog (meaning the Cardinal, a Butchers son)
had devoured the fairest Buck (alluding to the name of Buckingham) in all
England.

Here was interred the body of Edward, Edward the eldest son of Edward the
black Prince
the eldest son of Edward the black Prince, by Joan his wife, surnamed the
fair Maid of Kent; who was borne at Angolesme, Ann. 1375. and died at 7.
years of age.

Many of the Barons slain at Barnet-field, upon Easterday, 1471. were buried
here in the body of the Church; but now their bodies, with these before
remembered, and the bodies of an hundred more (mentioned by Stow) of exemplarie
note and knights degree, are not only despoiled of all outward funeral
ornaments, but dug up out of their Requietories, and dwelling houses raised
in the place, which was appointed for their eternal rest. Some part of this
Church is at this day yet standing, but in that no monument of this kind is
remaining; for it is converted into a Church for the Duch-Inhabitants of this
City: who, in that kind, can hardly brook any reverend Antiquity.

Near to this gate (if we give credit to our own ancient Chronicles) Nennius
the son of Hely, Nennius Helius Duke of Loegria.
and brother of Lud and Cassibelane, kings over the warlike Britains, was
interred. A man of a magnanimous spirit, heroical, and valiant. Who in the
wars between Julius Caesar and the Britains, sought courageously in defense
of his country, causing Caesar to fly back with the loss of his sword, which
Nennius took from him in single encounter, ^lores Hist. aetal. s. ca. 26.
and with which he slew Labienus Tribune of the Roman Nobility. But the
fifteenth day after this single opposition, he died of a wound received at the
hands of Caesar in the same conflict: the year of the worlds creation, 3913.
before the birth of our alone Savior, 51. And here (as I have said) was
entombed with all funeral state and solemnity: and with him the sword which
he took from Caesar the Emperor, as he himself commanded. Which sword was
called Reddeath, or rather Readie-death; wherewith if any one had been never
so little wounded, Cui nomen erat Cr^^^a Mors, quia null^s ab eo vulneratus
vinus e^adeba^. Id. eod.
he could never escape with life. Which you shall have in such old verse as
came to my hands.

Saint Helens.
This was the Church to the Nunnerie, The foundation of the Nunnery of S. Helen.
founded first by William Basing, Deane of Paul's (who lies here buried) about
the year 1212. and afterward by another William Basing (one of the Sheriffs
of London, in the second year of Edward the second) augmented both in building
and revenue. For which he is also holden to be a Founder. This religious house
was dedicated to the honor of Saint Helen, and replenished with black Nuns.
There was a partition betwixt the Nuns Church, and the Parish Church, but now
the whole Church belongs to the Parish. It was surrendered the 25. of
November, the 30. of Henry the 8. being valued at 314. l. 2. s. 6. d. of
yearly revenues.

Iohanne liberorum eiusdem Iohannis Crosby militis ille obiit, 1475 and illa
1466. quorum animabus propitietur Deus.

This Crosby was Sheriff of London, the year 1470. He was the builder of
Crosby house. He gave five hundred Marks toward the reforming of this Church,
which was bestowed (says Stow) with the better. As appears by his Arms both
in the stone-worke, roof of timber, and glasing; it is a fable said of him, to
be named Crosby, of being found by a Cross.

Not long after the second foundation of this house, by William Basing the
second, I find one Henry Gloucester, Citizen and Goldsmith of London
(descended by the mothers side from the second Founder) to be here interred,
approved by his last Will and Testament, written in the Latin tongue (which
was usual in former times) with which, for form and Antiquities sake, I
think it not much amiss to acquaint my Reader.

Saint Trinities in Leaden Hall.
This Chapel was first built by Simon Air, before remembered, who left
liuelihood to the Drapers sufficient, and withal a charge, That they should
within one year after his decease, establish perpetually a Master or Warden,
five secular Priests, six Clerks, and two Queristers, to sing daily divine
Service by note in the same for ever, which was never performed. Not long after
this, The Founda^ion of a Brotherhood of (...). Priests in ^e^den-Hall Chapel.
in the year, 1466. Ed. 4.6. William Rouse, John R^sby, and Thomas Ashby
Priests, founded a Fraternity in the same Chapel, dedicated to the blessed
Trinity, for threescore Priests; some of which, every Market day in the
forenoone, did celebrate divine Service, to such Market people, as would
repair to prayer.

The Priory of Christ-Church by Aldgate.
The foundation of the Priory of Christ-Church Aldgate.
This Priory was founded by Matilda, Queen, wife to Henry the first, the year
1108. for Canons Regular. The first Prior hereof was one Norman, and he was the
first Canon Regular in all England. This house was founded (says Stow) in the
Parishes of Mary Magdalene, S. Michael, Saint Katherine, and the holy Trinity.
All which are now but one Parish of Christ-Church, in old time called, Holy
Roode Parish. She gave unto this Church, and those that served God therein, the
Port of Aldgate, and ^he Soke thereunto belonging, with two parts of her rent,
which she received out of the City of Exceter. It became in process of time
rich in lands and ornaments, and passed all the Priories in London. This Priory
was surrendered to the king in the month of July, 1532. The Canons were sent to
other houses of their own order, and the said Priory with the appurtenances,
King Henry gave to Sir Thomas Audley, Baron Audley of Walden, and Lord
Chancellor of England: which came by marriage of the Lord Audleies daughter,
and heir unto Thomas, not long since, Duke of Norfolk, and was then called
the Dukes place. The Monuments which sometimes were in this Church, are set
down by that laborious Antiquarie, Io Stow, in his Suruay.

Within this parish was a Friery or Brotherhood founded by Raph Hosiar and
William Sabernes, The foundation of the C^ouc^^d Friars.
Anno 1298. These Friars by their order were called Fratres sanctae crucis,
Brethren of the holy cross, so denominated of wearing a Cross (anciently
called a Crouch) upon their garments, and of bearing the cross for the badge
and Arms of their house. This house was valued at the suppression to 52 l. 13

A Petition to Secretary Cromwell against the Prior of this house, a little
before the dissolution thereof.
Pleasethe it your honorable mastoreship to be aduertesid, Ex quibusel.
Collect. in sepe dict bib. Cot.
that in the time of Lent last past, your continual orator John Bartelote,
with others, to the number of five persons of good conversation, found the
Priore of the Crossyd Friores in London, The Priore of Crouched Friars found in
bed with hi^ wench.
at that time, being in bed with his whore both naked about xi. of the clock
in the forenoone upon a Friday; at which time the said Priore to the intent his
misdemeanour and shameful fact should not be known, whereby he should
sustain open shame, kneeled upon his knees, and not only desired your said
orator and his company to keep secret his said act, and not to disclose in any
wife the same, but for the same intent freely, and of his own motion, gave
amongst them about xxx l. which he then was possessed of; of the which sum
your Orator had by the said gift about vii l. And also the said Priore promised
to give amongst the said company xxx l. more by a certain day, and after by
mediation of friends of the said Priore, the said xxx l. was released to the
sum of vi l. which six pounds the said Priore bound himself to pay to the
said Orator by his Bill obligatory at a certain day in the same limeted: Yet
this notwithstanding, for by cause your said Orator for non payment of the said
vi l. did arrest the said Priore, he has so hainously informed the Lord
Chancelour against your Orator, that he will only put him to shewertie, making
the premises a heinous Robbery, saying openly that your Orator is worthy to be
hanged but also will by his high authority, compel your Orator to repay again
to the said Priore the some of xxx l. unless your most charetable goodness
be therein otherwise showed. It may therefore plese your good Mastershipe of
your abundant goodness to provide that the premeses may be duly examined,
according to equity; for this is the very and hole truth in the same. And your
seid Oratore shall prey to God for your honor and preservation long to endure.

By your humble Oratore to his power during his life, John Bartelote.


Saint Katherines by the Tower:
Foundation of S. Katherines Hospital.
This was the Church belonging to the Hospital, dedicated to the honor of
Saint Katherine, founded by Queen Maud, the wife of King Stephen, and much
augmented by Eleanor the wife of King Edward the first, and Philip wife to King
Edward the third, who left to it sufficient liuelihood: for a Master, 3
Brethren, Chaplains, and 3 Sisters, ten poor women, and six poor Clerks.
This house was valued at the general suppression, at 315 l. 14 s. 2 d. per

John Holland Duke of Excester.
Here under an Ancient monument ^ouly defaced, lies entombed the body of John
Holland, Duke of Exceter, Earl of Huntington, and of Iuory in Normandy, Lord
of Sparre, Admiral of England, Ireland, and Aquitaine, Lieuetenant General of
the Duchy of Aquitaine, Fellow of the honorable order of the Garter, and
Constable of the Tower of London, as he writ in his style; Ca^al. of honor.
^tow Annal.
when Henry the fifth, in the fifth of his reign, was to go over into Normandy,
this puissant John Holland, as then but Earl of Huntington, was sent before to
scour the seas, who meeting with nine Carrickes of Genoa, which were going to
aid the French King, fought with them, and sunk six of them, and took the
other three, with great store of money and treasure, and brought them, with his
prisoners, to the King. This battle was fought nere Harflew upon the fall of
the River Seyne into the narrow seas, of which an old versifier Harding.
They faught full sore, before the water of Sayn,
With Carrickes many, well stuffed and arrayed,
And many other ships great of Hispayn,
Barges Balyngers and Galleys vnfrayed,
Which proudly came upon our Ships vnprayed.
And by th'euen their sails aualed were set,
Their enemies slain in battayll, and sore bet.
And many dryent, were that day in the Sea,
That as our flete rode there then always,
Unto the feast next of his Natiuitee,
The Bodies flete among our Ships each day.
Full piteous was, and to see them ay,
That thousands were twenty, as they then told,
That taken were in that same battle bold.


This valiant brave Duke died full of years the fifth of August, in the 25.
year of King Henry the sixth, Anno 1447.

Here lie entombed by him, his two wives; the first was Anne, Anne the first
wife of John, Duke of Exceter.
daughter of Edmund, Earl Stafford by his wife Anne, the heir of Thomas of
Woodstocke, Duke of Gloucester, by whom he had issue, Henry Duke of Exceter.
She had bin formerly married unto Edmund Mortimer Earl of March and Vlster. I
cannot find the time of her death.

His second wife here entombed was also Anne, Anne the second wife of John,
Duke of Exceter.
daughter of Io. Mountague, the third of that name, Earl of Salisbury, who
formerly had bin twice married, to Sir Richard Hanckford, and to Sir John
Fitz-Lewis Knights. She died the 27 of November, 1457.

Here lies likewise entombed, Constance, Duchess of Norfolk.
the body of Constance, sister of the foresaid John, Duke of Exceter, daughter
of John Holland, first of that name, Duke of Exceter, married to Thomas Lord
Mowbray, (the son of Thomas, who died in banishment) Duke of Norfolk, Earl
of Nottingham, and Earl Marshall of England, and remarried to Sir John Gray,
Lord Gray of Ruthin; she died the sixteenth of Henry the sixth.

New Abbey in East-Smithfield.
Before the foundation of this Abbey, Catal. of Hon. Vincent.

The foundation of East-minster to the honor of God and our Lady of Grace.


there stood in the same place, a little Chapel within a Coemitorie or
Churchyard dedicated to the honor of God, by Raph Stratford Bishop of London,
wherein were interred innumerable many of such persons as died in the first
great Pestilence, the 23 of King Edward the third. Now the said King liking
well this plot of ground, (and having before in a tempest on the sea, and
peril of drowning, made a vow to build a Monastery to the honor of God, and
our Lady of Grace, (if God would grant him grace to come safe to land) builded
here a Monastery, wherein he placed white Monks of the Cistercian order; Stow
Suruay.
which house at the general suppression, was valued at 546 l. 10 d. yearly.
The Kings storehouse for victual, and for baking of Biskets to serve his
Majesty's Ships, is built in the same place where this Abbey stood.

The Minories.
Here was an Abbey of Nuns, The foundation of the Abbey of S. Clare, Nuns,
called the Minories.
of the order of Saint Clare, founded by Blanch, Queen of Navarre, and her
husband Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, Leicester, and Darby, brother to King
Edward the first, in the year 1293. This house was valued to dispend yearly
418 l. 8 s. 5 d. and was surrendered by Dame Elizabeth Savage, the last Abbess
there, unto King Henry the eight, in the 30 of his reign.

Saint Botolphs Algate.
In this Church over a vault, is a fair tomb of Alabaster, curiously wrought,
having these lines following engraven thereon.

The burial place of some of the honorable family of the Darcies.
Here lies Thomas Lord Darcy, of the north, and sometime of the order of the
Garter. Sir Nicholas Carew knight, sometime of the Garter; Lady Elizabeth Carew
daughter to Sir Francis Brian Knight, and Sir Arthur Darcy Knight, younger son
to the above named Lord Darcy, and Lady Mary his dear wife, daughter to Sir
Nicholas Carew, knight, who had ten sons and five daughters: Here lie
Charles, William and Philip, Mary and Vrsula, sons and daughters to the said
Sir Arthur and Mary his wife: whose souls God take to his infinite mercy, Amen.

This Thomas Lord Darcy, and Sir Nicholas Carew, (who was also master of the
Kings Horse) were both beheaded on the Tower hill; Stow. Annal.
the first because he was one (howsoever constrained thereunto by the Rebels)
of the commotion in Yorkshire, Anno 1536. the second, for being of council
with Henry, Marquess of Exceter, and Henry Poole Lord Mountague, who were
indighted, and found guilty of high Treason, for devising to maintain,
promote, Cardinal Poole.
and advance, one Reginald Poole late Deane of Exceter, enemy to the King,
beyond the sea, and to deprive the King, Anno 1539.

Sir Arthur Darcy here mentioned, was first buried in the new Abbey of
Eastminster, wherein he deceased; Sir Edward Darcy knight, son of Sir Arthur,
lies with his noble Ancestors in the same vault; but he died but lately.

Godwin Catal. of Bishops.
This John Clerk, Doctor of Divinity and master of the Rolls, was brought up
in Cambridge, and consecrated to his Bishopric, the year 1523. A man much
employed in Ambassages. He died as before, and was first buried in the
Minories, being poisoned (as it was supposed) in Germany, when he went
Ambassador to the Duke of Cleue, to render a reason of the Kings divorce from
the Lady Anne of Cleue his sister.

The foundation of a Knightengild or Confrery without Aldgate.
King Edgar established here without Aldgate a Knightengield or Confrery, for
thirteen knights or soldiers of good desert to him and the realm: the like
by supposition says Verstegan, was in Knight-riders street, being the place
where the residence or meeting of such Knights-riders with the King might be
kept.

Saint Mary Bethlem.
The foundation of S. Mary Bethlem.
This Hospital of Saint Mary of Bethlem, was founded by Simon Fitz-Mary, one of
the Sheriffs of London, in the year 1246. He founded it to have been a
Priorie of Canons, with Brethren and Sisters; it is now an Hospital for
distracted people, who are here received and kept, yet not without charges to
their kindred, or friends:

Saint Mary Spitle.
This Hospital was founded by Walter Brune Mercer, and Sheriff of London, The
foundation of S. Mary Spi^le;
and Rosia his wife, A.D. 1235. it was dedicated to the honor of Jesus Christ,
and his mother the perpetual Virgin Mary, by the name of Domus Dei, and Beat
Marie, extra Bishopsgate. This Hospital surrendered to king Henry the eight,
was valued to dispend 478. l. 6. s. 8. d. wherein were found, besides ornaments
of the Church, and other goods pertaining to the Hospital, one hundred and
fourscore Beds well furnished for receipt of the poor. This place is now best
known by the Sermons there preached on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in
Easter week.

Under this defaced Monument, Sir John Erlington knight, with Margaret his
wife, daughter and heir to Thomas Lord Itchingham, widow to William Blount,
son and heir to Walter Blount, the first Lord Mountioy, lie entombed.

In this Church diverse honorable persons lie buried, of whom (because they
dyed but in these later days) I shall speak hereafter. The plates with the
Inscriptions of such Monuments as were of more Antiquity, were all taken away
for covetousness of the brass, by one Doctor Hanmer (as I have it by relation
of the Inhabitants) Vicar of this Church, which he converted into coin, and
presently after (ashamed belike of such a detestable act) went over into
Ireland, and there ignominiously ended his days.

The Priory of Holywell.
This was an house of black Nuns, The foundation of Holywell.
anciently founded by a Bishop of London, and consecrated to the honor of God,
S. John Baptist. Stephen Grauesend, Bishop of this Diocese, about the year
1318. was hereunto a great benefactour. Sir Thomas Louell knight of the Garter,
in the reigns of King Henry the seventh, and of Henry the eighth, with whom
he was of Council, was another benefactor, not only in building a beautiful
Chapel, wherein his body was interred, but in many other goodly buildings,
and endowing the same with lands. In most of the glass windows of this house,
these two verses following (not long since to be read) were curiously painted:
Sir Thomas Louel^ Knight.
All the Nuns in Holywel,
Pray for the soul of Sir Thomas Louel.


He died the 25. of May at Endfield, Ann. 1524.

This Priory was valued at the suppression, to have of Lands two hundred
ninety three pounds ten shillings three pence by year, which with the house
were surrendered, Ann. 1539. the one and thirtieth of Henry the eight.

In ^ib. Cott.
I find in a pedigree of the right noble Lord Francis, now Earl of Rutland,
that Sir George Manors knight, Lord Ros of Hamlake, being with King Henry the
eight, at the siege of Turney and Turwine, there took a grievous sickness,
whereupon he languished, in the same year of this their expedition into
France; which was Ann. Dom. 1513. And according to his will was here entombed
in the Chapel, and near to the high Altar of this Priory.

This Sir George Manors was the eldest son of Sir Robert Manors knight, by
Eleanor his wife, the daughter and heir of Thomas Lord Ros of Hamlake: he
married Anne (the daughter and heir of Sir Thomas, Saint Leoger, or Sellinger
knight, begotten of his wife Anne, Duchess of Exceter, sister to king Edward
the fourth) by whom he had issue, Thomas Manors knight of the Garter, Lord Ros
of Hamelake, Belvoir, and Trusbut, and Earl of Rutland, the first of that
Surname. As also Oliver, Anthony, Richard, John, Elisabeth, Katherine, Eleanor,
Cicely, or Sisley, and Anne.

This house, with a circuit of ground thereunto adjoining, took denomination
of a certain sweet, wholesome and clear fountain, or well, within the
compass thereof; which for the virtue of the water was amongst the common
people reputed and called holy. It is now decayed, and indeed quite spoiled
with soil, dung, and other filthiness, purposely there laid, for the
heighthening of the ground for garden plots.

The Priory of Clerkenwell.
This Priory was likewise so called of a Well not far from the West end of
the Church of the said Priory. Which Well took name of the Parish Clerks in
London, who of old time (says Stow in his Suruay of the said City) were
accustomed there yearly to assemble, and to play some large history of holy
Scripture.

This Priory was founded in the year of our redemption, one thousand one
hundred, or thereabouts, by Jordan Briset, a wealthy and devout Baron, the
son of Rause, the son of Brian Briset, who gave fourteen acres of ground
lying in the field near unto the said Clerks well, to build thereupon an
house for religious Votaries, black Nuns. Which donation I have read
depensild upon a table in the Church, which by the fall of the Steeple (which
took down with it a great part of the Church) was battered all to pieces. The
said Jordan with Muriell his wife (for she is set down to be co-foundresse
with him) dedicated this their sacred structure to the honor of God, and the
Assumption of the blessed Virgin Mary.

Richard Beauveyes Bishop of London, about the year 1112. gave certain Lands
at Muswell hill to the said Nunnery, now in the possession of Sir Nicholas Roe
knight, Lib in lib. C^ll
confirmed by the Cartulary of king Stephen; as it is in the Lieger book of
the said house. Sciatis me confirmasse, etc. locum suum, etc. et quicquid
Ricardus Episcopus London et Iordanus fil^us Bricij, et alij Barons mei

of the house and land thereunto adjoining, thus. Sciatis me concessisse, etc.

habent circa muros earum in eodem campo, etc.

The names of the Prioresses of this house from the foundation unto the
dissolution, as they are set down in the same book, were these. First
Christiana. 2. Ermegard. 3. Hawisia. 4. Eleonora. 5. Alesia. 6. Cecilia. 7.

20. Margaret Bull. 21. Agnes Clifford. 22. Katherine Green. 23. Isabell
Hussy. And the last Lady Prioresse of this house was Isabell Sackvile, of the
right honorable Family of the Sackviles, the Ancestors of Sir Edward
Sackvile, now Baron of Buckhurst, and Earl of Dorset. She lies buried under a
marble stone in the Church of the Nunnery near unto the high Altar, whereupon
this Inscription, or Epitaph, is engraven in brass.

Hic iacet Isabella Sackvile, Isabell Sackvile Prioresse of S. Mary's

She made her last Will and Testament (as I find it in the Prerogative office)
the nineteenth day of February, in the said twelfth year of Queen Elizabeth,
wherein she bequeathes her body to be buried in Clarkenwell Church, and
ordaines the right honorable the Lord of Buckhurst her Cousin, the ouerseer of
this her Will, if it shall please his Lordship to take the pains:

She lived many years in the various days of diverse Princes: for I find in
the pedigree of the Earl of Dorset, that one William Sackevyle, by his Will
and Testament, dated the tenth day of August, in the 21. year of King Henry
the seventh, gave to his Niece Isabell Sackvyle a certain Legacy, she being
as then a Nun in the Priory of Clerkenwell.

Jordan Briset the foresaid Founder, Jordan Briset and Muriell his wife.
died the 17. of September, about the year of our Lord, 1124. and Muriell his
wife, the first of May next following: they were buried both together in the
Chapter House of this Church, now called the old Vestrie.

In the (...) the Chancell is a fair marble Tomb, with the (...) of a dead
man lying upon his shroud: ^.
the most artificially cut ^n stone that ever man beheld; all the plates of
brass are stolen away, only some few pieces remaining, containing these words.

Ecce quem cernis tuo nomini semper deuotum
Suscipe in sinum Virgo Maria tuum.
Spes me non fallat quam in te semper habebam

This Monument was erected to the memory of Sir William Weston knight, Lord
Prior of Saint John's Jerusalem, at the time of the dissolution of the said
Priory, to whom Henry the eight for his maintenance had allowed one thousand
pound of yearly pension during his life. Of which sum he received never a
penny: for so it fortuned, that upon the seventh day of May, 1540. being
Ascension day, and the same day of the dissolution of the house, he was
dissolved by death, which struck him to the heart, at the first time when he
heard of the dissolution of his order.

All the Funeral Monuments of Antiquity in this Church (which were many) as
you may read in Stowes Suruay, are quite defaced.

This Priory was valued at the suppression to be possessed of 282. l. 16. s. 5.
d. of yearly revenues.

Within the close of this Nunnery is a fair spacious house, built of late by
Sir Thomas Challoner knight deceased: upon the Frontispice whereof these verses
were depensild, now altogether obliterated.

Casta fides superest, velatae tecta sorores
Ista relegatae desuruere licet:
Nam venerandus Hymen hic vota ingalia seruat
Vestalemque focum mente fouere studet.
The Nunnery (now the inheritance of the right honorable Sir William Cauendish
knight, Lord Ogle, Viscount Mansfield, and Earl of Newcastle) being opposite
to this new brave building, ministered (belike) occasion and matter for the
making of this said Inscription.

This Hexamiter following is painted under a Sun dial in the entrance unto
the Nunnery.

Non aliter pereo species quam futilis Vmbrae.
The Priory of S. John of Jerusalem.
Jordan Briset having first founded the Priory of Nuns here by Clerkenwell,
as aforesaid, bought of the said Nuns ten Acres of ground, giving them for
the said ten Acres, twenty Acres of land in his Lordship of Willinghale, or
Wellinghall in Kent. Upon which ground (lying near unto the said Priory) he
laid the foundation of a religious structure for the knights Hospitalers of S.
John of Jerusalem. These following are the words out of the Register book of
the Deeds of the said house, written by one John Stilling-fleete, a brother of
the house, circa ann. 1434. to the end that their benefactors names being
known, Mss. in bib. Cot.
they may be daily remembered in their prayers.

Iordanus Briset Baro tempore regis Hen. primi circa an. Dom. 110. fundauit
domum ac Hospitale S. John's de Clerkenwel: Hic etiam erat Fundator domus
Monialium de Clerkenwel, ac ab eis emit december acras terre, super quas dictum
Hospitale ac domum fundauit: and pro illis december acris terre, dedit illis
Monialibus viginti acras terre in Dominico suo de Willinghale in com. Cant. etc.

In ye year of Criste (as I have the words out of an old Mss) 1185. ye vj. Ides
of Merche, In bib Cott.
ye dominical lettre being F, ye Church of ye Hospital of S: John's Jerusalem,
was dedicatyd to ye honor of S. John Baptiste by ye worschypfull fader Araclius
Patriarch, of ye resurrection of Christ, ye sam dey was dedycatyd ye high
Altr^, and ye Altre of S. John Evangelist by ye sam Patryarke. The said
Heraclius in the same year, dedicated the Church of the new Temple, as
hereafter is spoken.

Within a short time, this Hospital began to flourish, for infinite were the
donations of all sorts of people to this Fraternity, as in the Beadroul of
their benefactors is specified; but above all their Benefactors, they held
themselves most bound to Roger de Mowbray, whose liberality to their order was
so great, that by a common consent in their chapter, they made a decree, that
himself might remit and pardon any of the Brotherhood whomsoever, in case he
had trespassed against any of the statutes and ordinances of their order,
confessing and acknowledging withal, his offense and error. And also the
knights of this order granted, in token of thankfulness to John de Mowbray,
Lord of the Isle of Axholme, the successor of the foresaid Roger, that
himself and his successors, in every of their couents and assemblies, as well
in England, as beyond seas, should be received and entertained always in the
second place next to the King. Thus through the bounty both of Princes and
private persons, they rose to so high an estate, and great riches, that after a
sort (says Camden) they wallowed in wealth; Camd. in A^dl.
for they had about the year of our Lord 1240. within christendom, nineteen
thousand Lordships or Manours: like as the Templars nine thousand (the
revenues and rents whereof fell afterward also to these Hospitallers.) And
this estate of theirs grown to so great an height, made way for them to as
great honors; so as the Priore of this house was reputed the prime Baron of
the land, being able with fullness and abundance of all things to maintain an
honorable port. Robertus Botill Prior, Hospita^u Sancti Iohan^^ Jerusalem in

And thus they flourished for many years in Lordly pomp, until a Parliament
begun the 18. of April, 1540. Anno 32. Henry 8. their corporation was utterly
dissolved, the King allowing to every one of them, only a certain annual
pension during their lives; as you may read in the Annals of England.

The value of this foundation in the Kings books, was 3385 l. 19 s. 8 d. of
ancient yearly rent.

This Priory Church and house was preserved from spoil, or down pulling, so
long as Henry the 8 reigned, but in the 3 of King Ed. the sixth, the Church for
the most part, with the great Bell-tower (a most curious piece of workmanship,
graven, gilt and enameld, to the great beautifying of the City, says Stow)
was undermined and blown up with Gunpowder; the stone whereof was employed in
building of the Lord Protectors house in in the Strand.

The Charter House.
The foundation of ^he Charterhouse.
Sir Walter Manny Knight of the Garter, Lord of the town of Manny in the Dioces
of Cambrey, beyond the seas; in that raging pestilence in the 23 of King Ed.
the 3. when Churches and Churchyards in London might not suffice to bury the
dead, purchased a piece of ground in this place called Spitle croft, containing
13 acres and a Rodd, and caused the same to be enclosed for burials, and
dedicated by Raph Stratford Bishop of London; in which place, and in the same
year, more then 50000 persons were buried, in regard of such a multitude here
interred: he caused a Chapel here to be builded, wherein Offerings were made,
and Masses said for the souls of so many Christians departed. And afterward
about the year 1371. he caused here to be founded, an house of Carthusian
Monks, which he called the Salutation: which house at the dissolution, was
valued to be yearly worth, six hundred forty two pounds, four pence half
penny.

Stow Suruay.
John Stow says, that he had read this Inscription following, fixed on a stone
cross, sometime standing in the Charter House Church yard.

Anno Domini M.ccc.xl.ix. Regnante magna pestilentia, consecratum fuit hoc
Cemiterium, in quo and infra septa presentis Monasterij, sepulta fuerunt
mortuorum Corpora, plusquam quinquaginta millia, preter alia multa abhinc vsque
ad presens, quorum animabus propitietur Deus. Amen.

Ex Mss. in bib. Cot.
This inscription upon the foresaid Stone Cross, as also the relation before,
was taken out from the words of his charter, the substance whereof follows.

Walterus Dns. de Many, etc. cum nuper pestilentia esset tam grandis and
vi^lenta in ciuitate London quod Cemiteria Ecclesiae ciuitatis non possunt
sufficere pro sepultura a personarum in eadem pestilentia discedentia, nos moti

Bars, in a place called Spitle croft, and now called new Church-Haw, for the
burial of the persons aforesaid, and have caused the place to be blessed by
Raph then Bishop of London: in which place, plus quam Quinquaginta millia
personarum de dicta pestilentia morientium sepulti fuere. And there for our
Ladies sake we founded a Chapel, and of the holy order of the Cartusians,

The death of the Founder.
Sir Walter Manny, or de Many, the foresaid Founder, was buried here in his
own Church, who deceased in the same year that he laid his foundation, 137^.
His death was much lamented, by the King, the Nobility, and commons of all
England; for, with singular commendations, he had for a long time served under
Edward the third in the French wars, and was employed by him upon several
Embasies, and his truth and good council was ever much auailable to the whole
state of the kingdom. His obsequies were performed with great solemnity; King
Edward the third, and all his children, with the greatest Prelates, and Lord
Barons of the kingdom, being there present. Margaret, Lady Many, and Du^chesse
of Norfolk.
His wife Margaret, was here entombed with him; by whom he had issue, Thomas
Many, who in his youth was drowned in a Well at Detford in Kent, and Anne,
then his only daughter, and heir, married to John, Lord Hastings, Earl of
Penbroke:

Margaret, Suruay. (...)
Lady Many, says John Stow, here interred, (yet the Catalogue of Honor will
have her to be buried in the Minories) died the 24. of March, 1399. she was the
only daughter of Thomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, and Marshall of
England, second son of King Edward the first, and her fathers only heir
after the death of her brother Edward, which happened in the same year that
his father departed the world. She was for the greatness of her birth, her
large revenues and wealth, created Duchess of Norfolk for term of life:
she had been first married to John Lord Segraue, Vin^e^t C^t^l. Norf.
and her last husband was the foresaid Sir Walter Manny.

Here sometime was interred the body of Philip Morgan, Doctor of Law, Philip
Morgan Bishop of Ely.
Chancelour of Normandy, and Bishop of Ely; a very wise man, who with great
commendations governed that See nine years six months, and four days, and
departed this life at Bishops-Hatfield, October 25. 1434.

Many funeral monuments were in this Church, Suttons Hospital.
as you may find them mentioned in the Suruay of London.

This religious house is now turned into an Hospital, consisting of a Master,
a Preacher, a Free-Schoole with a Master and an Usher, fourscore decayed
gentlemen Soldiers, and forty scholars, maintained with sufficient clothing,
meat, drink, lodging, and wages; besides Officers and Ministers to attend
upon them all; so that the whole number now in the house with the attendants,
is one hundred and fourscore. The greatest gift that ever at any time in
England, no Abbey (at the first foundation thereof) excepted, or therewith to
be compared, being the gift of one man only, whose name was Thomas Sutton of
Castle Camps, in the County of Cambridge Esquire, borne at Knaith in the
County of Lincoln, who lived to the age of 79 years, and deceased the 12. day
of December, 1611. somewhat before this his famous Foundation was fully
accomplished.

Great Saint Bartholomewes.
This Priorie was founded by one Rahere, The foundation of great Saint
Bartholomewes.
a pleasant conceited witty gentleman, and a Courtier in the reign of King
Henry the first, which he dedicated to the honor of God and Saint Bartholomew,
and placed therein black Canons, or Canons regular; himself became their
first Prior; his foundation was confirmed in these words.

per manum nostram apud Winton, 15 Iunij, Anno reg. 37.

Here he died, and was here buried in a fair monument, renewed by Prior
Bolton, ^illiam Bolton the last Prior of S Bartholomewes.
which Bolton was the last Prior of this house; a great builder and repairer of
the Priorie, and the Parish Church, and of diverse lodgings belonging to the
same: as also of new he builded the Manor of Canonbury (now called Canbury) at
Islington, which belonged to the Canons of this house. This Bolton and the rest
of his brethren were portraied upon a Table sometimes hanging in this Church,
now it is in Sir Robert Cottons Library, holding up their hands to the
Crucifixe, under whom, these verses were depensi^d.

Gulielmo Bolton precibus succurrite vestris
Qualis erat pater hic, Domus hec, and cetera monstrant.
He died at his Parsonage house at Harrow upon the hill (as I have it by
relation) the fourth of Edward the sixth, and was there interred.

He surrendered up this his Priorie the 30 of Henry the 8. which was then valued
at 757 l. 8 s. 4 d. ob q. by year.

Roger Walden Bishop of London.
Here sometime lay entombed the body of Roger Walden, Bishop of London. Never
had any man better experience of the variable uncertainty of worldly felicity,
then he; for from the estate of a very poor man, he was suddenly raised to be
Treasurer of England (having been first Secretary to the King, Godwin de
praesulibus Angl.
Deane of York, and Treasurer of the town of Calis) and then made Archbishop
of Canterbury; which honor he enjoyed not past two years, but was removed
from the same, and forced to lead a private life a long time. At last being
once more lift up to the honor of this Bishopric of London; he left this
present life within the compass of the year following. Of this man thus
writes Thomas Walsingham, who lived in those times, and much what to the same
effect. I will use his own language.

Nempe ex pauperculo factus est Regni Thesaurarius; and so proceeds on forwards
with his story. Upon his monument this Epitaph was inlayd in brass.

being preferred unto him by the Pope, saying, that he would not accept of it
from any but from the king. As I find thus recorded in the Tower.

Little Saint Bartholomewes.
This Hospital for the poor and diseased, The foundation of Saint Bartl.
Hospital.
was founded by the forenamed Rahere Prior of great Saint Bartholomewes, to be
governed by a Master, and eight Brethren, being Priests for the Church: and
four Sisters, to see the poor served. It was valued at the suppression to
305. l. 6. s. 7. d. yearly. The Church remains a Parish to the Tenants
dwelling in the precinct of the Hospital; in which are many fair Funeral
Monuments. Whose Inscriptions (or the most of them) are set down in the Suruay
of London, these following only omitted.

Saint Sepulchers.
In this Church lies buried the body of that unfortunate Lord, Thomas Fi^es, ^
Baron Dacres of the South. Who was executed at Tiborne the 29. of June, 1541.
for that he with others going to hunt in Master Pelhams Park at Laughton in
Sussex, and meeting with some company, casually by the way, with whom and his
confederates, ensued a quarrel: in which a private man, (...). Annal.
one John Busbrig was slain by the said Lord, or some of his associates, which
were Io. Mantell, Io. Frouds, and George (all three executed for the same fact
at Saint Thomas Waterings) The death of this Lord was generally lamented, being
an hopeful gentleman of 24. years of age. This happened in that bloody
year, when Henry the eight unsheathed his sword upon the necks of the
Nobility.

The White Friars.
The foundation of the white Friars Carmelites.
These Friars were called Fratres beatae Mariae de monte Carmeli: first founded
by Sir Richard Gray knight, ancestor to the Lord Gray of Codnor, in the year
1241. King Edward the first gave to the Prior and brethren of that house, a
plot of ground here in Fleetstreet, whereupon to build their house: which was
afterward new builded by Hugh Courtney (the third of that Christian name Earl
of Devonshire) the year before he died, which was Aun. 1350. Sir Robert
Knolles knight, was a great builder here also, in the reign of Richard the
second, Stow S^^^uay.
and of Henry the fourth: who (being borne but of mean parentage in the County
of Chester) was by his valiant behavior advanced from a common Soldier (in
the French wars under Edward the third) to a great Commander; and being sent
General of an Army into France, in despite of their power, he drove their
people before him like Sheep, Lamb peramb.
destroying Towns, Castles, and Cities, in such a manner and number, that long
after in memory of this act, the sharp points and gable ends of overthrown
houses and Minsters, were called Knolles Miters. After which minding to make
himself as well-beloved of his country, as he was feared of foreign nations,
he built the goodly fair Bridge at Rochester, Lamb. peramb.
over the River of Medway, with a Chapel and a Chantrie at the East end
thereof. He founded a College, with an Hospital adjoining thereunto; in the
Town of Pontefract in Yorkshire, of which hereafter. He founded also an
Hospital in the City of Rome, for entertainment of English travelers, or
pilgrims, to that City, in place where Thomas Becket, Archbishop of
Canterbury, had builded a Chapel of the holy Trinity, which to this day
retains the name, and is a Seminary for our English Fugitives. He deceased at
his Manor of Scone Thorpe in Norfolk, was brought to London, and honorably
buried by the Lady Constance his wife, in the body of this Church; which he had
newly builded. Ann. 1407. the 15. of August. Of whom in his life, says Stow,
were made verses in Latin, thus by him put into English.

O Robert Knowles, most worthy of Fame,
By thy Prowess France was made tame.
Thy manhood made the French to yield,
By dint of sword in town and feeld.
Here sometime lay entombed in a goodly Monument of Alabaster, the body of
Robert Mascall, Rob Mascall Bishop of Hereford.
Bishop of Hereford, a man for his good learning and good life admired, and
beloved of all men: He was often employed by Henry the fourth (to whom he was
Confessor) upon Embasies to foreign Princes; and in the year 1415. sent with
two other Bishops to the Council of Constance. He built the Quier,
Presbytery, and Steeple of this Church; and gave many rich ornaments to this
religious house, wherein he died, 22. December. 1416.

William Lord Montacute Earl of Salisbury, Will. Montag^^ Earl of Salisbury.
Ypod^g (...)
and king of the Isle of Man, was here entombed. Whose noble Acts (says
Walsingham) to write worthily were a commendable matter. He founded the Abbey
of Bisham Montague in Barkshire, and died at a Iusts and Turney at Windsore, in
the year 1343.

For the rest here interred, I refer my Reader to the Suruay of London.

This house was valued at 26. l. 7. s. 3. d. and was surrendered the tenth of
November, the 30. of king Hen. the eight.

Since the writing of the premises, Penes (...) T^^swell.
I chanced to have the perusal of a Manuscript, penned in the praise of this
religious Order; out of which I collected diverse Epitaphs, which in times past
had been engraven upon the Sepulchers of certain Carmelites, here in the
Church of this Priory interred. And first, Stephen Patrington Bishop of S.
David's.
I find that Stephen Patrington, vir omnibus praestantioribus animi dotibus,
omnibus virtutibus preditus, et multiplici doctrinae varietate instructus, was
here buried in the body of the Quire. He was borne in the County of York, and
brought up in the University of Oxford, where he proceeded Doctor of
Divinity. He writ many learned books, and was an admirable Preacher, to whose
Sermons always came an incredible concurse of people, says Leland. He was
for the space of fifteen years Provincial of the Carmelites: Confessor he
was to king Henry the fourth, and held of him in great estimation, as also to
his Queen, and his eldest son Henry Prince of Wales; who when he came to the
Crown, preferred him to the Bishopric of Saint David's in Wales. Being at the
Council of Constance, he was, by the Pope, translated to Chichester; not long
after which he departed this world: and as it is in the Records in the Tower
before his translation could be perfected: in the year 1417. the 22. of
September. But I will come to the Inscription upon his Tomb, in verse and
prose as follows.

Hic Frater Stephanus de Patrington requiescit,

Nich. Kenton.
Here sometime lay buried the body of Nicholas Kenton; borne in Kenton a village
in Suffolk, about ten miles from Ipsewich; he was matriculated and instructed
in the rudiments of learning amongst the Carmelites at Ipswich. From whence he
went to Cambridge, where he attained to the full perfection of all solid
discipline. In poesy and Rhetoric he was exquisitely well exercised, an
acute Philosopher he was, and a singular divine. He writ many learned Comments
upon sundry places of the Scripture; and many other works mentioned by Bale;
He was Provincial of his order in England for the space of twelve years; and
had under his government above a thousand and five hundred Carmelites. He
desired, not long before his death, to give over his Prouinciallship, saying,
Se iam malle precibus et Deo libere vacare, quam praxi attendere, parere potius
deinceps velle quam preesse. Which was granted after much earnest suite made to
all his Couents. He died in the Dormitorie of this house, the fourth day of
September, in the year of our Lord, 1468. to whose honor this riming Epitaph
was annexed to his funeral Monument.

Kenton Doctoris Carmilite Nicholai,
Sic Peccatricis anime miserens Adonai.

Ipsa bis senis fungens summus Prior annis.
Huic sibi propitius veniam prestet pater almus;
Cuius spiramen scandens supra astra sit. Amen.
Io. Miluerton.
John Miluerton, a Carmelite Friar of Bristow, was here entombed; he was
Doctor of Divinity, and of the Chair, in the University of Oxford; from
whence he was sent for to Paris, by John Sorethe the Provincial of his Order,
where by a general Synod he was chosen Provincial of his order, through
England, Scotland, and Ireland. At length (because he defended such of his
order as preached against endowments of the Church with temporal possessions)
he was brought into trouble, committed to prison in Castle S. Angelo in Rome,
where he continued three years, and at length was delivered through certain
of the Cardinals, that were appointed his judges; but in the mean time he lost
the Bishopric of Saint David's, to which he was elected. He writ diverse
learned works before, after, and during the time of his imprisonment, which
are mentioned by Bale in his fifth centurie. At the last, full of years and
cares, he here ended his life, the last day save one of January in the year of
our redemption, 1486. and was buried in the Quire of this monastery, with
these nicking Hexameters engraven upon his monument.

John Loneye Doctor of Divinity, John Loney.
and a Carmelite Friar, was here interred in the cloister of the Church, to
whose memory this distich was made.

Clauditur hoc claustro Frater Loneye Johannes

This Loney, Pits. de illust. Aug. Scriptoribus.
says a late writer, was vir acu^i ingenij, magnae doctrinae, multae
lectionis, boni zeli, multae industriae: A man of an acute wit, excellent
doctrine, much reading, ardent devotion, great industry. He with twelve other
Doctors did condescend to the decree (says my Mss) of Master William Barton,
Chancellor of the university of Oxford, for the condemning of the sixteen
Articles of John Wickliffe of the Sacrament of the Altar.

An Epitaph upon John Palgraue, Prior sometimes of this house.

Huius confratris grauis est instantia, causa
Qua domus hec superest proceraque fabrica libris,
Et murus validus excludit Tamesis vndas.
Vestes dat sacras sibi det vestes Deus albas.
Of this Prior I find no further; neither of any other of the Carmelites
buried within this conuentuall Church.

Black Friars Church in Oldborne:
In old time about the year 1221. there was a religious house of Friars
Predicants, without the Bars in Oldborne; to which order, Hubert de Burgo Earl
of Kent, was an especial Benefactor: giving unto them that noble Palace at
Westminster, now called White Hall: Thus Hubert was a faithful servant to King
John, and to his son Henry the third, a careful Patriot of the State, and
one who unfeignedly loved his Country, who when he had made trial of the
variable changes of Fortune, Hubert de Burgo Earl of Kent.
as being seldom, or never, but either highly in the Kings love, or in the
Subjects hatred, or in the Kings heavy displeasure, and the peoples general
applause; lastly, being full fraught with years, as he was with many eminent
virtues, he died, in the favor of God, the King, and all good men, at his
Manor of Bansted in Surrey, the Ides of May, Anno 1243. He was first here
intombed, but afterward (as though he had been fatally ordained to take no
more rest in his grave, then quietness in his world^y employments) his body
was translated, at the same time when these Friars were removed from Oldborne
into London, to that house now called the black Friars, near unto Ludgate:
where belike it takes no better rest, then others have done so buried.

John Gyles, Clerk of the petit Bag.
Hic iacet Johannes Gyles nuper vnius Clericorum parue Bage cancel. Dominorum
H. Regum septimi et octaui, ac custos sieve clericus Rotulorum et Recordorum in
Turri London remanentium qui obijt vltimo die Feb. Anno 1523. cuius.

Clericus paruae Bagiae or Clarke of the Petit Bag, is an Officer in the
Chancerie, Cowell lit. c.
of which sort there be three, and the Master of the Rolls is their chief.
Their Office is to record the return of all Inquisitions, out of every Shire,
all Liueries granted in the Court of Wards, all ouster les maines, to make all
Patents of Customers, Gawgers, Controllers and Aulnegers; all Conge d'eslires
for Bishops, all Liberateis upon extent of Statute Staples; the recovery of
Recognisances forfeited, and all Elegits upon them; the summons of the
Nobility, Clergy, and Burgesses of the Parliament, Commissions directed to
Knights, and other of every shire, for seassing of the Subsidies, Writs for the
nomination of Collectors, and all trauerses upon any Office, bill, or
otherwise, and to receive money duel to the King for the same.

This Officer is mentioned, Anno 33. Hen. 8. cap. 22. and it is like he had
first this denomination and style of Petie Bags, because having to do with
so many Records of diverse kinds, as above mentioned, they were put in sundry
leather Bags, which were not so great as the Clarke of the Hamper now uses,
and therefore might be called Petits Bags, small or little bags.

This John Gyles was also keeper or Clerk of the Rolls and Records in the
Tower of London; an Office generally well known throughout all England; the
master whereof at this day is that learned Gentleman, Sir John Borrowes Knight;
under whom my understanding friend Will. Collet, and my industrious
countryman, Will. Riley, alias Rouge-Rose, Pursiuant at Arms, do officiate
the place.

The Temple Church.
The first Founder hereof is not certainly recorded, The first Sanctuary.
some hold that it was built by Dunwallo Mulmutius, about the year of the
worlds creation, 4748 the precincts whereof, he made a Sanctuary, or a place of
refuge for any person therein to be assured of life, liberty, and limbs, of
which I have spoken elsewhere.

Besides these privileges unto Temples, he constituted diverse good laws. Of
which he writ two books, the one called Statuta municipalia, the other Leges
iudiciariae, which is as much to say, as the statute Law, and the common Law.
Cook Reports 3 part ad Lect. out of Bale cent. 1. Having reduced his Realm

severed and brought into diverse dominions. He reigned 40. years, died the
year of the worlds creation, 4768. and was buried in this place, with other of
the British Kings. But it appears by this inscription following over the
Church door in the stone work, that this holy Structure was newly founded of
far later times, and dedicated to the honor of the blessed Virgin: yet I
think it is far more ancient.

indulsit. Knights Templers were the last Founders of this house, which at the
first were certain noble Soldiers religiously bent, who bound themselves by
vow in the hands of the Patriarch of Jerusalem to serve Christ after the manner
of Regular canons, in chastity and obedience, and to defend Christian
Religion, the holy land, and Pilgrims going to visit the Lords Sepulcher,
they flourished for a time in high reputation, for piety and devotion, but as
they increased in wealth, so they fell to wickedness; insomuch that in the
year 1308. all the Templers in England, as also in other parts of
Christendom, were apprehended and committed to diverse Prisons, and in the
year 1312. all their lands were given to the Knights Hospitalers of the order
of Saint John Baptist, called Saint John of Jerusalem, as I have said elsewhere.

There are in this Temple many very ancient monuments of famous men, (for out
of what respect I know not King Henry the third, and many of the Nobility,
desired much to be buried in this Church) shaped in marble, armed, their legs
cross, whose names are not to be gathered, by any inscriptions, for that time
has worn them out; upon the upper part of one of their portraitures, Camden
says that he has read. Comes Penbrochie, and upon the side this verse.

most powerful man in his time, being the Kings Marshall, General of his
Army, and Protector of the kingdom in the minority of King Henry the third,
until such time as he the said William died, which was in the year 1219. 27
die Martij. This Epitaph following goes also current for this glorious and
triumphant Earl, as an Epitome of his noble virtues.

Sum quem Saturnum sibi sensit Hibernia, Solemn
Anglia, Mercurium Normannia, Gallia Martem.
Irelands Saturn, Englands Sun am I,
The Mars of France, and Normans Mercury: or thus.
Whom Ireland once a Saturn found, England a Sun to be,
Whom Normandy a Mercury, and France Mars, I am he.
This William had five sons, William, Richard, Gilbert, Walter, and Anselme,
all Earls of Penbroke, and Marshals of England.

William Marshall. the younger, Earl of Penbroke.
Here by his father under the like monument, lies William the eldest son,
Earl of Penbroke, Lord of Strighull, Chepstow, Caerwent, Leigh (or Liege)
Weshford, Kildare, Ossorie and Carlogh, who died the sixth of April, 1231. as
it is in the book of Wauerly, wherein this Epitaph is made to his memory.

Militis istius mortem dolet Anglia, ridet
Wallia, viuentis bella minasque timens.
England laments the death of this brave Knight,
Wales laughs, he living did her so affright.
The Annals of Ireland will have him to be buried by his brother Richard, in
the Quire of the Friars Predicants in Kilkennie, of whom it was thus written.

Cuius sub fossa Kilkennia continet Ossa,
Whose bones bestowed in grave so deep,
Kilkenny Town does safely keep.
Wheresoever he was buried, a Martial brave Earl he was, which he worthily
showed, when as he set upon Lehwellin Prince of Wales, who invaded his
Territories, in his absence whilst he was prosecuting the wars in Ireland,
and returned from that battle a triumphant Conqu^rour.

Under another Monument lies the body of Gilbert Marshall, G^lbe^^ Ma^^shall
Earl of Penbroke.
Earl of Penbroke, and Marshall of England: Lord of Longevile in Normandy,
Leinster in Ireland, and of Chepstow, Strighull, and Caerwent in Wales. This
Potent Peer of the Realm (says Matthew Paris, in Ann. 1241.) proclaimed a
Turnament (in scorn of the kings authority; whereby such disports were
forbidden) to be holden at Hertford in the County of Hertford; to which place,
when many both of the Nobility and Gentry were assembled; it happened that
himself running, by the flinging of his horse was cast out of his sadle; and
the horse gave him such a blow on the breast, that he died the same day, being
the fifth of the Kalends of July, 1241. as aforesaid. Paris 1^4^.
His bowels were interred in the Abbey Church in the Town of Hertford, with
the bowels of one Sir Robert de Say knight, a gallant gentleman, slain in the
same exercise.

These kind of Iusts or Tournaments were brought in with king Stephen, and
practiced in many places of England, in such an outrageous manner, and with
such slaughter of Gentlemen, Hastiludium. Paris.
that to suppress such an heathenish disport, it was decreed by Parliament,
that whosoever therein were slain, should want Christian burial; and their
heirs be disinherited. Hic requiescit

This was a fragment of a funeral^ Inscription insculped upon one of these
crosse-legged Monuments; as I found it amongst other Collections by one
studious in Antiquities, in Sir Robert Cottons voluminous Library: which he
proves by the pedigree of the said Lord Rosses, to have been made to the
memory of one Robert Rosse a Templer, who died about the year 1245. and gave
to the Templars his Manor of Ribston.

William Plantaginet, Will. Plantaginet.
the fifth son of king Henry the third, lies here interred; who died in his
childhood, about the year 1256.

Saint Clement Danes.
Harold king of England.
So called because Harold (surnamed Harefoot, for his swift footmanship) king of
England, of the Danish line, and other Danes, were here buried.

This Harold was the base son of king Canut, by his concubine Alice of
Woluerhampton in Staffordshire, a Shoomakers daughter. His body was first
buried at Westminster, Stow Annal.
but afterward Hardicanut, the lawful son of Canut being king, commanded
his body to be dug out of the earth, and to be thrown into the Thames,
where it was by a Fisherman taken up and buried in this Churchyard. He died at
Oxford, 1040. having reigned three years and eight months.

Io. Arundel Bishop of Exceter.
Hic iacet.... Johannes Arundell.... Episcopus Exon. qui ob. die men's. Maij

This maimed Inscription would tell us thus much, that John Arundell (descended
of the ancient and most worshipful house of the Arundels of Lanherne in
Cornwall) Bishop of Exceter, lies here under interred, who died March 15. 1503.

Io. Booth Bishop of Exceter.
Hic iacet corpus venerabilis....Io..... Booth Legum Bacalaureus. Episcopus

This Bishop governed his Church wondrous well, and builded (as some suppose)
the Bishops See in the Quire, but being weary of the great troubles which were
in his country, between king Edward the fourth, and the Earl of Warwick, he
removed from thence to his house of Horsleigh in Hampshire, where he died.

Sauoy.
So called of Peter Earl of Sauoy, The foundation of the Hospital of Sauoy
the first builder thereof, which being overthrown by the Rebels of Kent, it
was again raised and beautifully rebuilded by king Henry the seventh for an
Hospital; and dedicated to the honor of Saint John Baptist: for which he
purchased lands for the relief of an hundred poor people. Of which you may
read this Inscription engraven over the Gate, toward the Street.

1505.
Hospitium hoc inopi Turbe Sauoia vocatum,
Septimus Henricus fundauit ab imo solo.
Henry the seventh to his merit and honor,
This Hospital foundyd, pore people to socor.
Many officers, ordinances, orders, and rules were appointed by the Founder; Ex
Mss. in bib. Cot.
for the better government of this Hospital, some of which I have read,
briefly extracted out of the Grand Charter, viz.

There are diverse other the like ordinances, which I omit.

This Hospital being valued to dispend 529. l. 15. s. 7. d. ob. by year, was
suppressed the tenth of June, the seventh of Edward the sixth, a little before
his death: the Beds, bedding, and other furniture belonging thereunto, with
seven hundred Marks of the said Lands by year, he gave to the Citizens of
London, with his house of Bridewell, to the furnishing thereof, and toward the
furnishing of the Hospital of S. Thomas in Southwarke, lately suppressed.

The second foundation of Sauoy Hospital.
This Hospital was again new founded, erected, corporated and endowed with
lands, by Queen Mary, the third of November, in the fourth of her reign; the
Ladies of the Court, and Maidens of Honor (a thing, says Stow, not to be
forgotten) stored the same of new with beds, bedding, and other furniture, in
very ample manner, and so it continues.

The Chapel of this Hospital serves now as a Parish Church to the Tenements
thereof near adjoining, and others. In which are diverse funeral Monuments,
but few of any Antiquity.

Of this eminent thrice noble Esquire, thus drawn and pulled out of the
Sanctuary, and cruelly murdered by the hands of wicked people, against the
Laws of the land, and privileges of the holy Church, as appears by this
Inscription I have read: thus much following out of a namelesse Manuscript.

being asw^y true ^^ge man to his Souereygne Lord the King, having taken

The Surname of Barret is at this day of exemplarie note, and does greatly
resflourish by that worthy Gentleman, Sir Edward Barret Knight, Lord Baron of
Newburgh, Chancelour of the Duchy of Lancaster, and one of his Majesty's most
honorable privy Council.

Saint Mary Rounciuall.
The Hospital of Saint Mary Rounciuall.
This was an Hospital by Charing Cross, and a cell to the Priorie, and covent
of Rounciuall in Nauar, in Pampalone Diocese, where a Fraternity was founded
in the 15 of Edward the fourth.

Hospital of Saint James.
Hospital of Saint James.
This Hospital was anciently founded by the Citizens of London, for fourteen
Sisters maidens, that were leprous, living chastely and honestly. This Hospital
was surrendered to Henry the eight, the 23 of his reign: the Sisters being
compounded withal, were allowed Pensions for the term of their lives; and the
King builded there a goodly manor house annexing thereunto a Park.

The Foundation of the religious house of Conuerts in Chancerie lane,
(anciently called New-streete,) now known by the name of the Rolls.
Henry the third, about the twentieth year of his reign, built this house for
the Jews, converted and to be converted to the faith of Christ: these are the
words in his grant.

But this Foundation did not continue long, for Edward the first (his son) in
the eighteenth year of his reign, banished all the Jews out of England,
confiscating all their goods, and leaving them nothing but money (barely) to
bear their charges. King Edward the third appointed this house for the custody
of the Rolls and Records of the Chancerie; ^^des^s Ca^al. Cancel. per

giving the same, by his charter, to one William Burstall, as then master of
that Office, and his Successors. In the Chapel of this house, John Young,
Doctor of both Laws, and master of the Rolls, lies entombed with this
Inscription.

Besides which, upon an old table hanging by, are written in text hand, these
verses following. Dominus firmamentum meum.

Saint Stephens Chapel.
This was a religious Structure, first begun by King Stephen, The foundation of
S. Stephens Chapel.
and afterward finished, and her revenues greatly augmented by King Edward
the third; in which he placed a Deane, twelve Canons secular, as many Vicars,
and other Ministers, who had their lodgings in Canon Row, now the habitations
of diverse Noblemen and Gentlemen. These are the words of King Edwards Grant.

In dei nomine Amen. Charta Regis Ed. tetijs. ex Record turr^s London.

The revenues wherewith King Edward endowed this covent, amounted to the value
of five hundred pounds by year; and at the suppression, the whole foundation
was rated to be yearly worth, (as I have it in the catalogue of Religious
houses,) one thousand, fourscore, and five pound ten shillings, five pence.
This Chapel serves now for the lower house of Parliament.

Westminster Abbey.
The foundati(...) West^inster Abbey.
CAmden out of Sulcardus reports, that here sometime stood an Idol Temple,
dedicated to Apollo; overthrown by an earthquake, about the year of grace,
153. Of the ruins of which, Sebert, King of the East Saxons, erected another
Temple for the service of the living God, and consecrated the same to Saint
Peter, about the year 610. near about the time of the building of Paul's,
Mellitus as then being Bishop of London, and Austin of Canterbury, which agrees
with these words in the charter of Edward the Confessor.

In Arch. turris London.

Afterward this Church being destroyed by the Danes; Dunstan Bishop of London,
reedified it about the year of Christ, 960. and made here a monastery for
twelve Monks. After him Edward the confessor with the tenth penny of all his
revenues, built it new for to be his own Sepulture: and a Monastery for
Benedictin Monks, endowing it with livings and ^ands, lying dispersed in diverse
parts of England. But, after an hundred and threescore years, King Henry the
third subverted this Fabric of King Edwards, and built from the very
Foundation, a new Church of very fair workmanship, supported with sundry
rows of Pillars. Rob. Glocest.

which the Abbots enlarged very much toward the west end: and King Henry the
seventh for the burial only of himself, his children, and their posterity,
adjoined thereunto a Chapel, which in regard of the beauty, and curious
contrived work thereof, is called of Leland, Orbis miraculum, the wonder of
the world. The first stone of this admirable Structure, consecrated to the
honor of the blessed Virgin, was laid by the hands of John Islip Abbot of
this monastery, Sir Reginald Bray, Knight of the Garter, and others, in the 18
year of his reign, the 24 day of January, upon which stone this Inscription
was engraven.

Illustrissimus Henricus Septimus Rex Anglie et Francie, et Dominus Hibernie,
posuit hanc Petram in honor beat virginis Marie xxiiij. die Ian^aarij, anno
Domini M.ccccc 11: et anno dicti Regis Henrici septimi decimo octauo.

Harpsfeeld, Hist. Ecclesiast. Angl. vnde^. ^aecul. ca. 16.
sometime Archdeacon of Canterbury, writing of the Antiquity and famous
renown of this Monastery, has these words.

Vt Albanense, propter protomartyris nostri Albani nobile eo loci martyrium,
sacrasque etiam ibi reconditas reliquias, coenobium reliquorum semper princeps
habitum est, ita posterioribus seculis Westmonasteriense, post illud maxim
eminebat.

It is likewise of especial note and reverend regard, by reason of the
consecration, the inauguration, and unction of our kings of England; of which
two riming Hexameters are wrought in the cloth of Arras, which adorn the Quire.

Hanc Regum sedem sibi Petrus consecrat Edem;
Quam tu Papa regis, insignit and vnctio Regis.
This Church is also greatly honored by the glorious Monuments of kings,
Queens, grand Peers, and others of eminent place and quality here interred.
And first of all,

Sebert the first founder; Sebert king of the East Saxons with his Queen
Aethelgoda.
the son of Sledda, and Queen Ricula, the sister of Ethelbert, king of Kent,
with his wife Ethelgoda lie here entombed; who died the last day of July, Ann.
Dom. 616. having reigned 13. years. Some 692. years after their bodies were
translated from their first place of burial to the South side of the Communion
Table, where they rest within a Tomb of lead, with this Epitaph.

Labilitas, breuitas mundane prosperitatis
Celica premia, gloria, gaudia danda beatis
Sebertum certum iure dedere satis.
Hic Rex Christicola ver^x fuit hac regione,
Qui nunc celicola gaudet mercede corone.
Rex humilis, docilis, scius, and pius, inclytus iste
Solicit, nitide, tacit, placide, bone christ
Vult servire tibi perficiendo sibi.
Ornat mores, spernit flores lucis auare,
Gliscens multum, christi cultum letificare.
Ecclesiam nimiam nimio studio fabricauit.
Hec illesa manus que fundamenta locauit;
Hic septingentis annisterra cumulatus,
Christi clementis instinctibus inde leuatus.
Isto sub lapide nunc iacet ipse, vide.
Atque domum Christo quia mundo fecit in isto,
Nunc pro mercede celi requiescit in ede.
Respice mortalis, promissio sit tibi talis.
Accipies si des, nil capies nisi des.
Es Christo qualis, Christus erit tibi talis,
Dapsilis esto sibi, largus eritque tibi.
Effectus non affectus si reddere possis,
Debet censeri; si nihil reddere possis,
Tunc bonus affectus pro facto debet haberi.
Sicut de lignis per aquam depellitur ignis.
Sic malo commissa fiunt donando remissa.
Reddet ad vsuram quod quis dat nomine Christi,
Nam vitam puram pro parvo dat Deus isti.
His wife Aethelgoda died the 13. of September, Ann. Dom. 615:

Upon the wall by this Tomb, the image of Saint Peter is depicted, speaking to
king Sebert in these verses.

Hic Rex Seberte pausas, mihi condita per te
Hec loca lustraui, demum lustrando dicaui.
Edward king of England, surnamed the Confessor.
Here lies honorably interred in a marble Tomb, checquered with variety of
stones, of beautiful colors; the body of Edward king of England, who for his
singular piety was numbered among the Confessors; a principal Founder of this
Church. Thus commended by a late writer.

(...). ^arn^r. ^lb. Engl.
Religious, chaste, wise, fortunate, stout, frank, and mild was he,
And from all taxes, wrongs, and foes, did set his kingdom free.
His Epitaph here inscribed consists of these three Hexameters.

Omnibus insignis virtutum landibus Heroes,
Sanctus Edwardus Confessor, Rex venerandus;
Quinto die Iani moriens super Ethera scandit.
Sursum corda. Moritur Ann. Dom. 1065.
Serlo of Paris has another Epitaph to his memory in these words.

Mss. in bib. Cot.

Presumpsit pacem rumpere nemo suam.
Quinque dies anui reserebat ianua Iani,
Cum Rex egrediens carnea templa finit.
My old Author Robert of Gloucester goes more punctually to the period of his
life, the years, months, weeks, and days of his reign, and time of his

He was for his simpleness (says the same Author) i called Edward Simple, yet
sothe our Lord noryshede his symplenes, and yaf him great grase that men should
be adradde of him that courhe natte be wroth, and though men trowed him to be
slow and sim^le, he had such subjects vndyr him that at his hes^ dauntyd
his enemies as Syward Earl of Northumbyrlonde, and Leofricus Earl of Hereforde,
that defendyd the king ever mor with there manhood, and favor against the
mantenors of Duc Godwy^^e. Questionle^^^, for sanctity of life and sweet
conversation, he did far excel all other Princes; and kings of that
disposition are for the most part too soft and piiant (an imperfection in
supreme authority) to command the turbulent spirits of an unsettled kingdom;
and their understanding too shallow to d^ue into the depth of their enemies

who was the daughter of Godwin, that treacherous Earl of Kent; a virgin most
chaste, whose breast was a schoolehouse of all liberal sciences, mild, modest,
faithful, innocent, and unfeignedly holy, no way sauouring of her fathers
barbarousnesse, being never hurtful to any. Whereupon this verse was applied
unto her, and her father. Sicut Spina Rosam genuit Godwinus Editham:

She died in December, 1074. in the eight year of her widowhood, and in the
eight year of the Conquerours reign. Professing upon her deathbed, that
notwithstanding she had been king Edwards wife the space of eighteen years,
yet she died a pure Virgin. For this, king Edward (not without reason) is
taxed, in that he under a godly pretext of Religion, and vowed virginity, cast
off all care of having issue, and exposed the kingdom to the prey of ambitious
humors. Yet some, that would excuse him in this, affirm, that this holy king
was not willing to beget any heirs, that should succeed him out of a
treacherous race.

1118. She had an excellent Epigram made to her commendation whereof these
four verses only remain.

Prospera non laetam fecere, nec aspera tristem,
Aspera risus erant, prospera terror erant.
Non decor effecit fragilem, non sceptra superbam;
Sola potens humilis, sola pudica decens.
Thus paraphrastically translated. No prosperous state did make her glad;
Nor adverse chances made her sad.
If Fortune frowned she then did smile,
If Fortune smiled, she feared the while.
If Beauty tempted, she said nay;
No pride she took in Scepters sway.
She only high her self debast;
A Lady only fair and chaste.
She went every day in the Lent time to this Church barefoot, and bare-legd,
wearing a garment of hair; she would wash and kiss the feet of the poorest
people, and give them bountiful Alms. For which being reprehended by a
Courtier, she gave him a short answer, which I have out of Robert of
Gloucester. The Courtiers speech.
Madame for Gods love is this well i do

Foul would the king thynk if that hit he wiste,
And right well abyse him er he your mouth kiste,

She founded (as I have said before) the Priory of Christ-church within
Aldgate, and the Hospital of S. Giles in the Fields. She builded the Bridges
over the River of Lea at Stratford Bow, and over the little Brook called
Chanelsebridge; she gave much likewise to the repairing of highways. But I
will take my leave of her with these words of Paris: Mat. Paris ad Ann. 1118.
Obijt eodem anno Matildis Regina Anglorum cuius corpus apud Westmonasterium

King Henry the third.
Here lies under a rich Monument of Porphery, adorned with precious stones, the
body of Henry the third, king of England. In the fifth year of whose reign,
and the Saturday next before his second time of Coronation, the New work (the
old being ruinous and pulled down) of this Church of Westminster, Mat. West.
was begun. To which sacred Edifice this king was a perswader: he was the
Founder, and laid the first stone in the groundwork of the building. Rob.
Glocest.
The Newerke at Westmynstre ye king tho ganne anon,
Aftyr his coronyng and leyde the first stone.
As if he meant the world should know, his intention was to consecrate his
future actions to the glory of God. He gave to this Church royal gifts of
Copes, Jewels, and rich vessels: and for the holy Relics of Edward the
Confessor, he caused a coffin to be made of pure gold and precious stones, and
so artificially by the most cunning Goldsmiths that could be gotten; that
although the matter it was made of, was of an inestimable value, tamen Materiam
superabat opus, yet the workmanship excelled the matter, says Matthew Paris. A
Prince he was, as our histories affirm, of greater devotion then discretion,
in permitting the depredation of himself and his subjects by papal
ouerswayings. This King (says Robert of Gloucester) as in worldlich doing was
not hald full wise, but mor devout to spiritual things; he was every dey woned
to here three Masses by note. Quante innocentie, quante patientie, quanteque
deuotionis, et quanti meriti in vita sua erat apud Deum, testantur post ipsius
mortem miracula subsecuta: Of how much integrity, of how much patience, of how
much devotion, and of how much merit he was in his life time before God, the
miracles which followed after his death, do testify, says the compendious
chronicle of Canterbury.

He died the 16 of November 1273. when he lived sixty five years, Mss. in bib.
Cot
and reigned fifty six years, and eighteen days, this Epitaph following is
annexed to his Tomb.

Tertius Henricus iacet hic pietatis amicus
Ecclesiam strauit istam, quam post renouauit
Reddet ei munus qui regnat trinus et vnus:
Tertius Henricus est Templi conditor huius. Dulce bellum inexpertis.

Which is thus Englished by Robert Fabian.
The friend of pity, and of alms deed,
Henry the third whylome of England King,
Who this Church brake, and after his mede
Again renewed into this fair buylding,
Now rests in here, which did so great a thing*

That as one God reygneth in persons three.
Henry the third is the buylder of this Temple.

In the additions to Robert of Gloucester, a Manuscript in the Heralds Office,
these rimes are written to his remembrance.

wardship of the Peers; showing himself in all his actions after, capable to

At the time of his Fathers death, he was abroad in Palestine, pursuing his
high desires for the Holy Wars, and after six years, from his first setting
out, he returns into England, receives the Crown (without which he had been
a King almost three years) at the hands of Robert, Archbishop of Canterbury;
and with him is Eleanor his virtuous Queen, likewise crowned at Westminster.
To the which their magnificent pompous Coronations, the presence of Alexander,
King of Scotland, (who had married Margaret his eldest sister) was required, as
appears by this Record following.

King Ed. Coronation.
The said King Alexander comes accordingly to his Brothers Coronation (which was
in September 1275) guarded with a goodly troop of Knights and Gentlemen; at
which solemnity also were present, John, Duke of Britain, who had married
Beatrice his second sister; Eleanor his mother, with multitudes of Peers and
others: and for the more royal celebration of this great Feast, and honor of
so martial a King, there were five hundredth great horses let loose, every one
to take them for his own, who could. Of which, out of an old oreworne
Manuscript, a piece as follows.

King Edward was coronyd and anoyntyd as right heir of Engelond, with much
honor and worsschyp. And aftur Mass, the King went to his Paleys for to hold
a ryall feste, among them that him had done seruyse and worsschyp. And when
he was set at his mete, King Alexandre of Scotland come to do him seruyse and
worsschyp with a queyntyse, and an hondryd knights with him, horsed and arayd.
And when they weren light of their horse, they let their horse goon whether
they would, and they that would take them, had them to their own behofe,
without any chalange. And aftyr that come Sir Edmond King Edwardes Brother, a
curtayse Knight and a gentle of ren^on, and the Earl of Cornwayle, and the
Earl of Glowcesire. And aftyr them come the Earl of Penbroke, and the Earl of
Warren, and each of them led on their hondes be them self an hordryd
knights, disgyse in their arms. And when they weren alyght of their horse,
they let them goo whedyr they would, and they that cowde them take, had them
stylle at their own lyking. And when all this was done, King Edward did his
dyligens and his might to amend the Relme, and redress the wrongs in the
best manner, to the honor of God, and profit to the crown, and to holy
cherche, and to amend the anoyance of the common people. The worthiest knight he
was of all the world of honor and worsschyp, for the grace of God was in him,
and ever had the vyctory of his enemies.

vanquished the Sarasines, the French, the Scots, the Welsh, and perfidious
Christians, and whatsoever appertained to Regal glory and honor, as well in
actions as in condition, state, and princely deportment, was in him to be found.

Dum vi^it Rex, et valuit sua magna potestas,

English.

And honest had might.
Scotos Edward dum vixit suppeditauit
Tenuit, afflixit, depressit, dilaniauit.
Whilst Edward lived, the Scots he still kept under,
Bridled, deprest, debased, rent asunder.
Yet here give me leave to tell my Reader, (maugre this our English Rimer) that
the valiant Scots did not always suffer King Edward to escape scotfree; for he
laying siege to the strong Town of Berwicke, they defended it manfully, bet
the English men back, and burnt some of the English Ships; upon which their
fortunate enterprise in derision of our King, they made this mockish rhyme
doggerell.

This scornful dittie came no sooner to king Edwards ears, then that through
his mighty strength, he passed dikes, assailed the Town, and wan it with the
death of fifteen thousand Scots, S. Daniel.

the slain in battle) and after that the Castles of Dunbarre, Roxborough,

Another bloody battle he had with the Scots at Foukirke, wherein are reported
to be slain, two hundred knights, and forty thousand foot of the Scots. Some
have threescore and ten thousand, some threescore thousand, the scottish
footmen valorously fighting, as it were to the last man. Upon these victories,
king Edward endeauours to extinguish, if it were possible, the very memory of
the Nation: abolishing all their ancient laws; traducing their Ecclesiastical
rites, to the custom of England: dispoiling them of their Histories; their
instruments of State: their antique monuments, left either by the Romans, or
erected by themselves, transporting all their Books and Bookemen into England.

the Fate of the kingdom consisted, of which will you please to take this

Distichon is inscribed. Ni fallat vatum Scoti hunc quocunque locatum

The Regal race of Scots shall rule that place.
Which, by whomsoever it was written, we, who now live, find it happily
accomplished.

Of the worthiness of this our matchless King, will it please you hear a
little from a late Writer, namely, M. Drayton, in the seventeenth Song of
Polyolbion.

Henry the third.
This long-liu'd Prince expyr'd: the next succeeded; he
Of us, that for a God might well related be.
Our Longshanks, Scotlands scourge, who to the Orcads taught
His Scepter, and with him from wild Albania brought,

Henry the third.
The seat on which her Kings inaugurated were.
He tamed the desperate Welsh, that out so long had stood,
And made them take a Prince sprung of the English blood.
This Isle from Sea to Sea, he generally controld,
And made the other parts of England both to hold.
The learned Antiquarie and Lawyer, John Seldom, in his Illustrations upon the
said Song, gives us this Gloss following upon the Verse.

The seat on which our Kings inaugurated were.
This seat (says he) is the Chair and Stone at Westminster, whereon our
Sovereigns are inaugurated. The Scottish Stories affirm, that the Stone was
first in Gallicia of Spain at Brigantia (whether that be Compostella, as
Francis Tarapha wills, or Coronna, as Florian del Campo conjectures, or
Betansos according to Mariana, I cannot determine) where Gathel, king of Scots
there, sat on it as his Throne. Thence was it brought into Ireland by Simon
Brech, first king of Scots, transplanted into that Isle, about seven hundred
years before Christ. Out of Ireland, King Ferguze (in him by some is the
beginning of the now continuing Scottish reign) about three hundred and
seventy years afterward brought it into Scotland. King Kenneth some eight
hundred and fifty of the Incarnation, placed it at the Abbey of Scone (in the
Shrifdome of Perth) where the Coronation of his Successors was usual, as of
our Monarchs now at Westminster; and in the Saxon times at Kingston upon
Thames. This Kenneth, some say, caused the Distich. The fatal Marble.
Ni fallat vatum, as before, to be engraven upon it. Whereupon it is called
Fatale Marmor in Hector Boethius, and enclosed it in a wodden Chair. It is now
at Westminster, and on it are the Coronations of our Sovereigns: Thither first
brought (as the Author here speaks) among other spoils, by Edward Longshanks,
after his wars and victories against King John Balliol, Ann. 1297. Reg. Regis
Ed. 1.24. Thus much of this potent king out of Polyolbion.

But to return, these high spirited Scots (then which no people in the world
are more valiant) not minding to endure the tyranny of King Edward, entered into
England at several times; and in Northumberland and Cumberland, The cruelty of
the Scots.
slew the aged and impotent, women in childbed, and young children; spoiled the

Priests, as Scholars, whom they thrust into the Schoolehouse there, Rich

and closing up the doors, set fire on the School, and burned all them to
ashes that were within it. They burned Churches, they forced women without
respect of order, condition, or quality, as well the maids, widows, and
wives, as Nuns, that were reputed in those days consecrated to God, and when
they had been so abused, many of them were after murdered. So that the cruel
and bloody desolation whereof Lucan speaks in his second book of the
Pharsalian wars, may aptly be inferred here, as fitly describing the
merciless murder of all states and sexes, without partiality, under the hand
of the enemy. For, says he, Nobilitas cum plebe perit, lateque vagatur
Ensis, and a nullo revocatum est pectore ferrum,
Stat cruor in templis, multaque rubentia caede
Lubrica saxa madent, nulli iam prosuit aetas,
Non senis extremum piguit vergentibus annis
Praecipitasse diem, non primo in limine vitae
Infantis miseri nascentia rumpere fata.


Thus exquisitely translated into English.

Senators with Plebeians lost their breath,
^ro. May.
The sword raged uncontrolled: no breast was free:
The Temples stainde with blood, and slippery
Were the red stones with slaughter: no age then
Was free: the near spent time of aged men
They hastened on; nor sham'de with bloody knife,
To cut the Infants new spunne thread of life.
Blood worthy to have been shed on both sides, against another kind of enemy,
then Christians: the deformity of which effusions, may justly represent unto us
the blessed estate of our now settled Union.

Ranulph the Monk of Chester, speaks somewhat more succinctly of the warlike
passages in those times, betwixt the puissant brave English, and the terrible
neuer-tamed Scot on this manner; I will use the old language of his Translatour
Treuisa, who flourished in the reign of king Henry the sixth.

Polychron. l. 7. cap. 40.

Of this prophetical prediction I have spoken elsewhere, which (...) that of
the marble stone) upon the inauguration of our late Souer^^^^^ Lord King James,
of happy memory, in his Regal Chair of Impe^^^^^ government, had full
accomplishment.

The period of the days, as also the character of this magnificent Monarch
Edward, ^
are thus delivered by a late Writer.

In July, 1307 although he found himself not well, he enter; Scotland with a
fresh Army, which he led not ^arre; for falling into a Dissenterie, he dies at
Borough upon the sand^, as if to show on what foundation (...) h^d built all
his glory in this world: having reigned thirty four years, seven months,
aged sixty eight. A Prince of a generous spirit, wherein the fire held out even
to the very last: borne and bred for action and military af^faires, which he
managed with great judgment: ever wary and provident for his own business:
watchful and eager to enlarge his power: and was more for the greatness of
England, then the quiet thereof. And this we may justly say of him, that never
king before, or since, shed so much Christian blood within this Isle of
Britain, as this C^ristian warrior did (...) his time, and was the cause of
much more in that following.

By our great and judicious Antiquary Camden, ^
he is thus (...), as follows.

For no one thing was this little Burgh upon Sands more famous, than, that King
Edward the first, that triumphant Conqueror of his enemies, was here taken out
of the world by untimely death A ^ight noble and worthy Prince, to whom God
proportioned a most princely presence and personage, as a right worthy seat to
entertain so heroical a mind For he not only in regard of fortitude and
wisdom, but also for a beautiful and personal presence was in all points
answerable to the height of Royal Majesty, whom fortune also in the very
Prime and flower of his age, inured to many a war, and exercised in most
dangerous troubles of the state, whiles she framed and fitted him for the
Empire of Britain; which he, being once crowned King, managed and governed in
such wise, that having subdued the Welsh, and vanquished the Scots, he may
most justly be counted a chief ornament and honor of Britain.

Amongst other admonitions and precepts, which he gave to his son Edward
(after him king of England) upon his death bed he charged him, (...) of
^a^singham.
that he should carry his Fathers bones about with him in some Coffin, till he
had marched through all Scotland, and subdued all his enemies, for that none
should be able to overcome him while his Skeleton marched with him: thinking,
belike, that the care to preserve them from enemies would make a Son fight
nobly. Moreover he commanded the said Prince, That whereas himself, by the
continual new attempts of Bruce, king of Scotland, could not in person
(according to his vow) make war in the Holyland, therefore he should send his
Heart thither, accompanied with seuenscore knights, and their retinues, for
whose support he had provided thirty and two thousand pounds of silver. That
his Heart being so by them conuayed, he did hope in God, that all things there
would prosper with them. Lastly, That upon pain of eternal damnation, the
said money should not be expended upon any other uses. Walsing.
Sed filius immorigerus patris mandata negligit: But the disobedient Son
little regarded the commandment of his Father.

He died the seventh of July, the year aforesaid; his body was conuayed to
this Abbey, and accompanied most of the way with the Popes Legate, the reverend
Bishops, and most of the English Nobility, where it was interred with that
state as became the person of so potent a Prince; The dead bodies of our
English kings (anciently) preserved from corruption.
And such was the care of his Successors, to keep his body from corruption,
as that the Searecloth wherein his embalmed body was enwrapt, was often
renewed, as does appear upon Record thus.

Certain rimes or verses, are annexed to his Tomb as follows.

Mors est inesta nimis magnos que iungit in imis,
Maxima mors minimis coniungens vltima primis;
Nullus in orb fuit homo viuens nec valet esse
Qui non morte ruit: est hinc exire necesse.
Nobilis and fortis, tibi tu considere noli,
Omnia sunt mortis, sibi subdit singula soli,
De mundi medio magnum mors impia mouit,
Anglia pre tedio satis anxia plangere novit:
Corruit Edwardus vario veneratus honor,
Rex nuper vt Nardus fragrans virtutis odore,
Cord Leopardus, invictus and absque pauore,
Ad rixam tardus, discretus, and eucharis ore.
Viribus armorum quasi Gigas ardua gessit,
Colla superborum prudens per prelia pressit,
Inter Flandrenses fortuna sibi been fauit,
Vt quoque Wallenses and Scotos suppeditauit.
Rex bonus absque pari strenue sua regna regebat.
Quod natura dari potuit bonitatis habebat.
Actio iustitie, pax regni, sanctio legis,
Et fuga nequitie premunt precordia Regis.
Gloria tota ruit, Regem capit hec modo fossa,
Rex quandoque fuit, nunc nil nisi puluis et ossa:
Filius ipse Dei quem cord colebat et ore,
Gaudia fecit ei nullo permista dolor.
The which verses (says Fabian) to the intent that they should be had in
mind, and also that the reader might have the more desire to ouer-reade them;
I have therefore set them out in Baladde Royal, after my rude making as
follows.

This sorrowful death which brings great full low, Fabians Ballad Royal.

And most and leest he joins into one,
This man to whom his pere was not y know
Has now subdued, not sparyng him alone,
Which of all order this world to ouergone,
None was to be spared, of so great equity
As he, if any, for noblesse spared should be.
Therefore thou noble or mighty, trust none oder grace,
But thou shall pay to death thy natural debt;
And like as he from this world did chase
This mighty Prince, and from his frendys fette,
For whom all England loud mourned and grette:
So shall thou and oder in deths snare fall,
None shall escape, to reckyn kinds all.
Edward with many and diverse graces endowed,
And like as Nardus most sweetest of odoure,
In smelling passyth, and most he is allowed
Of all sweet odours, so did this knyghtly flower
By virtuous arts surmounte in honor,
All oder Princes; whose heart was Lybar delyke,
And without fere, were he hole or syke.
This Prince was slow to all manner of strife,
Discrete, and wise, and true of his word,
In armies a Geaunt, term of all his life,
Excelling acts doing by dynte of the sword,
Subduyd the proud, of prudence he bore the horde,
Of Flaunders by fate he had great amyte,
And Walshe, and Scotts, by strength subduyd he.
This good King perelesse, his lands firmly gyded,
What nature might give he failed in nothing,
No part of bounte from his was discided,
He was justice, and peace, and of law stablishyng,
And chaser of iniquyte by his virtuous living:
In whom these graces with innumerable mo,
Fermly were roted, that death has taken us fro.
That whylom was a King, now is but duste and bone,
All glory is fallen, and this pit keeps the king,
But he that yeldeth all thing by his one,
The Son of God, to whom above all thing
With heart and mouth he did all worsshyppyng,
That Lord of his joy perdurable to last,
Grant him sorrowlesse evermore to taste.
All Kings have long hands, alluding to the extensure of their Regal
government, of which Ovid in one of his Epistles: thus, An nescis longas
Regibus esse manus?


This King had also long legs, and, a longis tibijs, surnamed he was
Longshankes. But I stray beyond my limits, his virtues have taken me prisoner,
and detained me much longer then I expected; let me take liberty to conclude
with these verses, in commendation of his valor, out of the fore-remembred
additions to Robert of Gloucester.

Here lies entombed, Eleanor his first wife, Queen of England, who went with
him into the holy land, in which voyage her husband was stabbed with a poisoned
dagger by a Sarazen, the rankled wound whereof was judged incurable by his
Physicians, yet she daily and nightly sucked out the rank poison, and so by
aduenturing her own, saved her husbands life. She was the only daughter of
Ferdinando, the third King of Castile and Leons: she died at Herdby in
Lincolnshire, 29 November 1290. having been King Edwards wife 36 years, who
erected to her honor those Crosses, as Statues, at Lincoln, Grantham,
Stanford, Geddington, Northampton, Stony Stratford, Dunstable, (now destroyed)
Saint Albans, Waltham, and Westminster, called Charing-Crosse, all adorned with
the arms of Castile, Leon, and the Earldome or County of Ponthieu, which by
her right was annexed to the Crown of England. Moreover the said King Edward
(so ardent was his affection to the memory of his deceased Eleanor) gave twelve
Manors, Lordships, and Hamlets, to Walter then Abbot of Westminster, and his
successors for ever, for the keeping of yearly Obits for his said Queen, and
for money that should be geeuen to the poor, that came to the solemnization of
the same. Her Epitaph.

Nobilis Hispani iacet hic soror inclita Regis,

Here lies gloriously entombed, Edward the third King of England.
the most mighty Monarch that ever ware the Crown of England, who conquered
Calis, recovered Aquitaine and Normandy, took John, King of France, and David
King of Scots, prisoners; added the arms and title of France to his own,
declaring his claim in this kind of verse: thus, Rex sum regnorum bina ratione
duorum, Remains.

Anglorum Regno sum Rex ego iure paterno;
Matris iure quidem Francorum nuncupor idem.
Hinc est Armorum variatio facta meorum.


To which the French answered scornefully in verses to the same temper, but
some what touching Edward with ill grounded vanity, pretending right to the
Crown of France, by Queen Isabell his mother: before whom, (if Daughters should
succeed in the sacred Lillies of France) her eldest Sister must march, Madam
Margaret of France, wife to Ferdinand, fourth of that name, King of Castille.

Praedo Regnorum qui diceris esse duorum, Fauine in the orders of England.

Francorum Regno priuaberis, atque Paterno.
Matris vbique nullum Ius Broles non habet vllum,
Iure Mariti carens alia est Mulier prior illa.
Succedunt Mares huic Regno non Mulieres.
Hinc est Armorum variatio stulta tuorum.
He excelled his Ancestors also in the victorious valor of his children; in
their obedience to him, and love among themselves; and one of his greatest
felicities was, that he had a Lady to his wife (the fruitful mother of a fair
issue) of such excellent virtue and government, as that then King Edwards
Fortunes seemed to fall into Eclipse when she was hidden in her Sepulcher. He
was the son of Edward the second by Isabel, daughter to Philip the Fair,
King of France; his father being amoued from the kingdoms government,
(against whom he had no guilty thought) he was by public Sanction thereupon
established in the royal Throne, being of the age of fourteen years; and
when he had reigned 50 years, died at his Manor of Shine, June 21. 1377. these
verses are annexed to his monument.

Hic decus Anglorum, flos Regum preteritorum
Forma futurorum, Rex clemens pax populorum
Tertius Edwardus, regni complens Iubileum
Inuictus Pardus, pollens bellis Machabeum.
Tertius Edwardus Fama super ethera notus
pugna pro patria.
Four of these verses are thus translated by Speed in his History of the said
King, where, upon the words Pollens bellis Machabeum
he gives this marginall note, as follows.

He means (says he) more able in battle, then Machabeus; you must bear
with the breaking of Priscians head, for it is written of a King that used to
break many.

Take with you, if you please, another translation of these Meters by one who
lived nearer to those times.

Of English kings here lyth the beauteous flower,
Of all before passed, and myrrour to them shall sue,
A merciful king, of peace conseruatour,

Sam. Daniel.
A late writer says, he was a Prince the soonest a man, and the longest that
held so, of any we read; he was of personage comely, of an even stature,
graceful, respectively affable, and well expressing himself. A Prince who
loved Justice, Order, and his people, the supreme virtues of a Sovereign.
First his love of Justice, His Justice.
was seen by the many Statutes he made for the due execution thereof, and the
most straight-binding oath, he ordained to be ministered unto his Judges and
Iusticiars: the punishment inflicted on them for corruption in their offices,
causing some to be thrust out, and others grievously fined. He bettered also
that form of public Justice which his Grandfather first began (and which
remains to this day) making also excellent Laws for the same. His regard of
Order.
His regard to the observation of Order among his people, so many Laws do
witness, as were made to restrain them from Excesses in all kinds. His love
to his Subjects, His love to his people.
was expressed in the often easing of their grieuances, and his willingness to
give them all fair satisfaction, as appears by the continual granting of the
due observation of their Charters in most of his Parliaments. And when ( Ann.
Reg. 14.) they were jealous, upon his assuming the title of the kingdom of
France, lest England should thereby come to be under the subjection of that
Crown, as being the greater, he to clear them of that doubt, passed a
Statute, in the firmest manner could be devised, that this kingdom should
remain entire as before, without any violation of the rights it had.

Provident he was in all his actions, His Providence.
never vnder-taking any thing before he had first furnished himself with
means to perform it.

For his gifts we find them not such as either his own fame and reputation,
or any way distasted the State. To be short, he was a Prince who knew his
work, and did it: and therefore was he better obeyed, better respected and
served, then any of his Predecessors.

His works of Piety were great and many, His works of Piety.
as the founding of East-minster an Abbey (of the Cisteux order) near the
Tower. An Abbey for Nuns at Dartford in Kent (of both which I have already
written) The Kings Hall in Cambridge for poor Scholars. An Hospital for the
poor at Calais. The building of Saint Stephens Chapel at Westminster, with
the endowment of three hundred pound, per annum, to that Church. His augmenting
the Chapel at Windsore, and provisions there for Churchmen, and twenty four
poor knights, His buildings.
etc. These were his public works, the best Monuments and most lasting to
glorify the memory of Princes. Besides these, his private buildings are great
and many; as the Castle of Windsore, which he re-edified and enlarged.

His magnificence was showed in Triumphs and Feasts, which were sumptuously
celebrated, with all due rites and ceremonies, the preseruers of Reverence and
Majesty: To conclude, he was a Prince, whose nature agreed with his office, as
only made for it.

On this manner, as he was in the strength of his years, and in the height of
his vigorous actions, his character is expressed by many Authors. Now may it
please you in this place to take a view of this the mighty great Monarch of
England, France, and Ireland, as he was wrinkled with age, weakened with a sore
lingering disease, and laid down upon his Deaths-bed.

When he had attained to the age of threescore and five years, or thereabouts,
and wrastled with a sickness which gave him the overthrow; lying in the bed,
and at the point of death, his eyes darkened, his speech altered, and his
natural heat almost extinguished, Walsing. in vit. Ed. 3.
one, whom of all other he most entirely affected, took the rings from his
fingers, which for the royalty of his Majesty he was wont to wear, so bad
him adieu; and withdrew herself into another room (a woman she was,
inuerecunda p^llex, as Walsingham calls her, whose name was Alice Piers)
neither was he left only of her the said Alice, but of other the knights and
Esquires, who had served him, allured more with his gifts then his love.
Amongst many there was only present at that time a certain Priest (other of
his servants applying the spoil of what they could lay hands on) who lamenting
the kings misery, and inwardly touched with grief of heart, for that amongst
so many Councellers which he had, there was none that would minister unto him
the word of life, came boldly unto him, and admonished him to lift up the eyes
as well of his body, as of his heart, unto God, and with sighs to ask mercy
of him, whose Majesty he well knew he had grievously offended. Whereupon the
king listened to the words of the Priest, and although a little before he had
wanted the use of his tongue, yet then taking strength to him, he seemed to
speak what was in his mind. And then what for weakness of his body,
contrition of his heart, and sobbing for his sins, his voice and speech
failed him, and scarce half pronouncing this word Jesus, he gave up the Ghost,
at his Manor of Sheene (now Richmount) as aforesaid.

If you will hear any more of this Martial king, you must have the patience
to trouble your selves in the reading of these obsolete old rimes.

Philip Queen of England.
Philippa (of whom I have spoken before) Queen of England, wife of Edward the
third, daughter of William of Bauaria, Earl of Henault, and Holland, by Ioane
sister of Philip of Valoys, king of France, lies entombed at her husbands
feet; She was a Lady of great virtue, and a constant true lover of our Nation;
who when she had been king Edwards wife forty two years, she died August,
15. 1369. These verses are annexed to her Monument.

Gulielmi Hannonis sobeles postrema Philippa,
Hic roseo quondam pulchra decore iacet.
Tertius Edwardus Rex ista coninge letus
Materno suasu nobiliumque fuit.
Frater Johannes Comes Mauortius heroes,
Huic illam voluit consociare viro.
Hec iunxit Flandros coniunctio sanguinis Anglis:
In Francos venit hinc Gallica dira lues*
Dotibus hec raris viguit Regina Philippa
Forma prestanti, Religione, fide.
Fecunda nata est proles numerosa parenti,
Insignes peperit magnanimosque duces.
Oxonij posuit studiosis optima nutrix
Regineas Edes, Palladiam scholam.
Coniux Edwardi iacet hic Regina Philippa.
Disce viuere.
Thus there Englished: Fair Philip William Hennaldes child and youngest
daughter dear,
Of roseat hue, and beauty bright, in tomb lies hilled here.
Edward the third through mothers will, and Nobles good consent;
Took her to wife, and joyfully with her his time he spent.
His brother John a Martial man, and eke a valiant knight,
Did link this woman to this king in bonds of marriage right.
This match and marriage thus in blood, did bind the Flemings sure
To Englishmen, by which they did the Frenchmens wrack procure.
This Philip flowr'd in gifts full rare, and treasures of the mind,
In beauty bright, Religion, Faith; to all and each most kind,
A fruitful Mother Philip was, full many a son she bred,
And brought forth many a worthy knight, hardy, and full of dred.
A careful Nurse to Students all, at Oxford she did found
Queens College, and Dame Pallas School, that did her fame resound.
The wife of Edward, dear,
Queen Philip lies here:
Learn to live.
She was the youngest of the five daughters of William Earl of Henault
aforesaid; especially chosen before any of her Sisters for king Edwards wife,
by a Bishop (of what See I am uncertain) and other Lords temporal, sent
thither, were sent as Ambassadors, to treat of the marriage. Of which thus
much out of Harding. cap. 178. as follows.

He sent forth than, to Henauld for a wife,
A Bishop, and other Lords temporal,
Where in Chaumbre prevy and secretife,
At discouerit dischenely also in all,
As semyng was to estate Virginal
Among them selfs, our lords for hie prudence
Of the Bishop asked counsel and sentence.
Which daughter of five should be the Queen,
Who counsailled thus, with sad auisement,
We will have her with good hippis I mean,
For she will bear good soonnes at mine intent;
To which they all accorded by one assent,
And chase Philip, that was full feminine,
As the Bishop most wise did determine.
But then among them selfs they laugh fast ay,
The lords than said, the Bishop couth
Full mekill skill of a woman al way,
That so couth chese a lady that was uncouth,
And for the merry words that came of his mouth
They trowed he had right great experience
Of womanes rule and her conuenience.
Now, what experience this Bishop had in women's conueniency of bringing forth
children, I know not, but it so fell out, that she had issue by her said
husband King Edward, seven sons, and five daughters, borne for the glory of
our Nation.

1. Edward Prince of Wales, borne at Woodstocke. 2. William, borne at Hatfield,
in the County of Hertford. 3. Lionell, borne at the City of Antwerpe, Duke of
Clarence. 4. John, borne at Gaunt, the chief Town of Flanders, Duke of
Lancaster. 5. Edmond, surnamed of Langley, Duke of York. 6. William, another
of their Sons, surnamed of Windsore, where he was borne. 7. Thomas, the
youngest son of King Edward and Queen Philip, surnamed of Woodstocke, the
place of his birth, Duke of Gloucester.
Daughters.
1. Isabell, the eldest Daughter, was married with great pomp at Windsore, to
Ingelram of Guisnes, Lord of Coucy, Earl of Soissoms, and after Archduke of
Austria, whom king Edward his Father in law created also Earl of Bedford. 2.
Ioane, desired in marriage by solemn Embassage from Alphons, king of Castile
and Leon, son of king Ferdinando the fourth, was espoused by Proxy,
entitled Queen of Spain, conveyed into that country, where she presently
deceased of a great plague that then reigned. 3. Blanch the third daughter,
died young, and lies buried in this Abbey Church. 4. Mary the fourth daughter
was married to John Montford, Duke of Britain. 5. Margaret their youngest
daughter was the first wife of John de Hastings, Earl of Penbroke.
It is reported of this Queen (says Milles) that when she perceived her life
would en^, she requested to speak with the King her husband, who accordingly
came to her in great heaviness: being come, she took him by the hand, and
after a few words of induction, she prayed him that he would in no wise deny
her, in three requests. First, that all Merchants and others to whom she ought
any debt, (whether on this side or beyond the seas) might be paid and
discharged. Secondly, that all such promises as she had made to Churches, as
well within the realm as without, might be performed. Thirdly, that he would
be pleased (whenever God should call him,) to choose none other Sepulcher, but
that wherein her body should be laid: all which were performed, and so I leave
them both lying in one Grave, expecting a joyful resurrection.

Richard the second, Richard the second, King of England.
King of England and France, Lord of Ireland, son to Edward, Prince of Wales,
by Ioane, daughter to the Earl of Kent, being deprived both of living and
life, by that popular usurper Henry the (...) by his commandment, obscurely
buried at Langley in Hertfortshire, in the Church of the Friars Predicants; was
by the appointment of Henry the fifth, removed from thence with great honor, in
a Chair royal, himself and his nobility attending the sacred relics of
this anointed King: which he solemnly here enterred amongst his ancestors, and
founded perpetually one day every week, a Dirge, with nine Lessons and a
morning mass to be celebrated for the soul of the said King Richard, Ranulph,
Monk of Chester. Lib. vltimo.
and upon each of those days, six shillings eight pence to be given to the
poor people; and once every year upon the same day of his Anniuerse, twenty
pounds in pence to be distributed to the most needful: He made for him a
glorious Tomb, and this glosing Epitaph deciphering the lineaments of his
body, and qualities of mind; which to any, who knows upon what points he was
put out of Majesty and State, may seem strange, if not ridiculous; thus it
runs.

Prudens et mundus Richardus iure secundus,
Per fatum victus, iacet hic sub marmore pictus.
Verax sermon, prudens suit et ratione.
Corpore procerus, animo prudens vt Homerus,
Ecclesie fauit, elatos suppeditauit.
Quemuis prostrauit Regalia qui violauit.
O bruit hereticos, et eorum strauit amicos.
O clemens christ tibi deuotus suit iste
Votis Baptiste, salues quem protulit iste.
Hic iacet immiti consumptus morte Richardus
fuisse felicem miserrimum.
Fabian who translated this Epitaph into English, Folio 166.
desirous, as it seems, to extenuate the force of such palpable gross
flattery; annexeth this stanza.

But yet, alas, although this meter, or ryme,
Thus does embellish this noble Princes fame;
And that some Clerk which favored him sometime,
L^st by his cunnyng thus to enhanse his name,
Yet by his story appears in him some blame.
Wherefore to Princes is surest memory,
Their lives to exercise in virtuous constancy.
But John Harding, speaking of the greatness of his household, and the pride
and whoredom therein, as well amongst the Clergy as Laity, is more inuectiue
in his rimes, which to read I hope will not be troublesome: thus he begins.

Truly I herd Robert Ireleffe say
(...)
Clerk of the Grenecloth; and that to the Household
Came every day, forth most party always
Ten thousand folk, by his messis told,
That followed the house aye as they would.
And in the Kechin three hundred Seruitours,
And in each office many occupiours.
And Ladies fair, with their gentlewomen,
Chamberers also and lauenders,
Three hundred of them were occupied then.
There was great pride among the Officers.
And of all men far passing their compeers,
Of rich array, and much more costious,
Then was before, or since, and more precious.
In his Chapel, were Bishops then of Bohemia.
Beam,
Some of Irelond, and some also of France;
Some of England, and clerks of many a realm,
That litill connyng had or conisance.
In music honorably God his service to auance
In the Chapel, or in holy Scripture
On matter of Goddis to refigure.
Lewed men, they were in clerks clothyng,
Disguysed fair, in form of clerks wise,
Their Perishyns full litill enfourmyng
In Law divine, or else in God his seruise.
But right practyfe they were in couetise
Each year to make full great collection
At home, instead of souls correction.
Great Lechery and fornication
Was in that house, and also great aduoutree.
Of Paramours was great consolacion,
Of each degree, well more of Prelacie
Then of the temporal, or of the chivalry.
Great tax ay the king took through all the land,
For which Commons him hated both free and bond.
John Gower concludes his cronica tripartita, ^
annexed to his book entitled Vox Clamantis, with these riming verses
concerning the said King.

Cronica Richardi qui sceptra tulit Leopardi
Vt patet est dicta, populo sed non benedicta
Vt speculum mundi quo lux nequit vlla resundi,
Sic vacuus transit, sibi nil nisi culpa remansit,
Vnde superbus erat, modo si preconia querat.
Eius honor sordet, laus culpat, gloria mordet:
Hoc concernentes caueant qui sunt sapientes;
Nam male viuentes Deus odit in orb regentes:
Est qui peccator non esse potest dominator,
Ricardo test finis probat hoc manifest:
Post sua demerita perijt sua pompa sopita
Qualis erat vita cronica stabit ita.
He was murdered at Pomfret Castle in the bloody Tower, (so called from that
time (upon that bloody act) to this day,) on Saint Valentines day, 1399. the
first of Henry the fourth, when he had reigned 22 years. That beautiful
picture of a King sighing, crowned in a chair of estate, at the upper end of
the Quire in this Church, is said to be of him, which witnesses how goodly a
creature he was in outward lineaments: but I will conclude with these rimes out
of my old Manuscript, the Addition to Robert of Gloucester.

Henry the fifth King of England.
Henry the fifth, son of Henry the fourth, King of England, and conqueror of
France, died at Boys de Viscenna, not far from Paris, the last of August,
1422. having reigned 9 years, 5 months, and odd days, from thence his body
was conuaied to this Abbey; upon whose Tomb, Katherine his wife, caused a
royal picture to be laid, covered all over with silver plate gilded, the head
whereof was all of massy silver: all which (at the suppression, when the
battering hammers of destruction, (as Master Speed says) did sound almost in
every Church) were sacrilegiously broken off, and by purloyning, transferred to
far prophaner uses, where at this day, the headless monument is to be seen,
and these verses written upon his Tomb.

Dux Normanorum, verus Conquestor eorum,
Here Is Francorum; decessit et Hector eorum.
Here Normans Duke, so styled by conquest just,
True heir of France; Great Hector, lies in dust.
Gallorum mastix iacet hic Henricus in vrna
Domat omnia virtus.
So many virtues are attributed, by all writers, to this heroical King Henry,
the renown of England, and glory of Wales, that where to begin, or when to
make an end in his deserved praise, I know not: so I will leave him, amongst
the many Monarchs of this most famous Empire, none more complete, relating
only a few rimes, which in some sort does particularize his memorable exploits.

Add to Robert of Gloucester.

Here lies Katherine, Katherine the wife of Henry the fifth.
Queen of England, wife to the foresaid King Henry the fifth, in a chest or
coffin with a loose cover to be seen and handled of any that will much desire
it, and that by her own appointment (as he that shows the Tombs will tell
you by tradition) in regard of her disobedience to her husband for being
delivered of her Son Henry the sixth at Windsore, the place which he forbad.
But the truth is that she being first buried in our Ladies Chapel here in
this Church, her corpse were taken up; when as Henry the seventh laid the
foundation of that admirable structure his Chapel royal, which have ever
since so remained, and never reburied. She was the daughter to Charles the
sixth, king of France: she died at Bermondsey in Southwarke, the second of
January, Ann. Dom. 1437. Her Epitaph.

Hic Katherina iacet Francorum filia Regis,
Here Is and Regni, Carole Sexte, tui.
Henrici quinti thalamo bis leta iugali
Nam sic vir duplici clarus honor fuit:
Iure suo Anglorum, Katherine iure triumphans
Francorum obtinuit ius, decus imperij.
Grata venit letis felix Regina Britannis
Perque dies celebrant quatuor ore Deum.

Cuius in imperio Francus and Anglus erat.
Non sibi sed Regno felici sidere natum;
Sed Patri and Matri Religione parem.
Post ex Owino Tiddero tertia proles,

Henry the seventh king of England.
Here lies buried in one of the stateliest Monuments of Europe, both for the
Chapel, and for the Sepulcher, the body of Henry the seventh, King of
England, the first begotten Son of Edmund, Earl of Richmond, by Margaret,
daughter and heir to John Duke of Somerset. This glorious rich Tomb is
compassed about with verses, penned by that Poet Laureat (as he styles
himself) and Kings Orator, John Skeleton: I will take only the shortest of his
Epitaphs or Eulogiums, and most to the purpose, Septimus hic situs est
Henricus, gloria Regum
Cunctorum, ipsius qui tempestate fuerunt,
Ingenio atque opibus gestarum and nomine rerum,
Accessere quibus nature dona benign:
Frontis honos, facies augusta, heroica forma,
Iunctaque ei suanis coniux perpulchra, pudica,
Et secunda fuit: felices prole parents,
Henricum quibus octauum terra Anglia debes.
He deceased at Richmond the 22. of April, 1509. when he had reigned 23.
years, and somewhat more then seven months, and lived fifty two years.
Whosoever would know further of this king, let him read his History, wherein
he is delineated to the life, by the matchless and never enough admired pen
of that famous, learned, and eloquent knight, Sir Francis Bacon, not long since
deceased, Lord Verulam, and Viscount Saint Alban.

Elizabeth the wife of king Hen. the seventh.
Here lies entombed by her Husband Henry the seventh, Elizabeth, the first
child legitimate and eldest daughter of king Edward the fourth; to whom she
was married the eighteenth of January, 1488. whereby was united the long
contending Families of Lancaster and York, and the Roses red and white joined
into one, to the great joy of the English Subjects. She was his wife eighteen
years and twenty four days, and died in childbed in the Tower of London,
the eleventh of February, even the day of her own Nativity, the eighteenth of
her Husbands reign, and year of our Salvation, 1503.

I have an Epitaph of this good Queen (borne for Englands happiness) which I
transcribed out of a Manuscript in Sir Robert Cottons Library.

Extinctum iacet hic genus a Plantagine ductum,
Et Rosa purpureis candida nupta Rosis.
Elisabet claris Anglorum Regibus orta,
Regina and Patrij gloria rara soli.
Edwardi soboles quarti, tibi septime coniux
Henrice, heu populi cura benigna tui.
Exemplex vite qua nec prestantior altra
Moribus, ingenio, nec probitate fuit.
Reginam Deus eterno dignetur honor
Et Regem hic annos viuere Nestoreos.
Margaret Countess of Richmond.
Here lies magnificently entombed, Margaret, Countess of Richmond, and Darby,
daughter and only heir to John Duke of Somerset, by Margaret, daughter to the
Lord Beauchampe of Powicke, first married to Edmund the son of Owen Tedder,
who begat Henry the seventh, King of England, and afterward to Thomas Stanley,
Earl of Derby. Two Colleges, namely, of Christ, and Saint John Baptist, she
erected for Students in Cambridge. She instituted also two Divinity Lectures,
one at Cambridge, and the other at Oxenford, who, having lived so long to see
her Grandchilde, Henry the eight, crowned King, died the twelfth of July, 1509.
in the first year of his reign. Here is a long Elegy made to her memory by
the foresaid Skeleton, with this terrible curse to all those that shall tread,
spoil, or take it away.

Qui lacerat, violatue, rapit presens Epitoma,
Hunc laceretque voret cerberus absque mora.
Hanc tecum statuas Dominam precor O Sator orbis,
Quo regnas rutilans Rex sine fine manens.
Here lies Margaret, Margaret the daughter of King Ed. 4.
one of the daughters of King Edward the fourth, by Elizabeth his royal Queen
and wife. She died an Infant, the eleventh of December, 1472.

Nobilitas and forma, decorque tenella inuentus
Insimul hic ista mortis sunt condita cista.
Vt genus, and nomen, sexum, tempus quoque mortis
Noseas; cuncta tibi manifestat margo Sepulchri.
Here lies Elizabeth, Elizab. the daughter of king Hen. 7.
the second daughter of King Henry the seventh, by his loving consort and
Queen, Elizabeth, who was borne the second day of July, 1492. and died the 14.
day of November, 1495. Upon her Tomb this Epitaph.

Hic post sata iacet proles regalis in isto
Sarcophago, inuenis, nobilis Elizabeth,
Princeps illustris, Hen. Sept. filia Regis
Qui bini regni florida sceptra tenet.
Atropos hanc rapuit seuissima nuntia mortis,
Sit super in celo vita perhennis ei.
Here lies interred, Anne Queen of England.
without any Monument, Anne, the second daughter and coheire to Richard Nevil,
the stout Earl of Warwick, and Salisbury: who was first married to Edward
Prince of Wales, the son and only child of king Henry the sixth, and after
remarried to Richard Duke of Gloucester (who at the battle of Tewxbury had
stabbed her husband into the heart with his dagger) afterward by usurpation
king of England, surnamed Crook-backe. She died (not without suspicion of being
poisoned) the 16. of March, 1485.

Here lies entombed Edmund, Edmund Earl of Lancaster.
the second son of King Henry the third, Earl of Lancaster, Leicester, and
Darby, surnamed Crouch-backe, of his bowing in his back, because he is never
found (says Vincent in his discovery of Brooks errors, title Lancaster) with
any other addition, and indeed with no other Epithet then Gibbosus; which
signifies crooked, crump-shouldred, or Camell-backed. But others say he was so
denominated of wearing the sign of the Cross (anciently called a Crouch) upon
his back, which was usually worn of such as vowed voyages to Jerusalem; as he
had done. Further confirming their opinions from the name of Crouched-Friers,
that wore a Cross upon their garments. And Io. Harding speaking of him and his
elder Brother Edward, afterward king of England, and of their voyage to
Jerusalem, has these verses to the same effect.

Harding c. 147.
His brother Edward and he associate
To Jerusalem, their voyage them avowed.
Two semely Princes, together adioynate,
In all the world was none them like allowed,
So large and fair they were, each man he bowed.
Edward above his men was largely seen
By his shulders more hie and made full clean.
Edmond next him the comeliest Prince alive,
Not croke backed, ne in no wise disfigured.
As some men wrote, the right line to deprive,
Through great falsehed made it to be scriptured:
For cause it should always be refigured,
And mentioned well, his issue to prevail
Unto the Crown, by such a gouernaile.
I cannot let pass, although I do somewhat digress, the cunning sleights and
devises the Popes of Rome used in these times, to empouerish this kingdom, and
enrich their own coffers. Mat. Paris.
First they combine and confederate with the king to the utter undoing of all
his loyal Subjects. And now Pope Alexander the fourth puts a trick upon the
king himself (a Prince more pious then prudent) which exhausts his Treasure,
Pageant of Popes.
and leaves him for a laughing-stocke to all other Nations. This Pope,
forsooth, invested this Edmund his son, into the kingdoms of Sicilia and
Apulia ( Conradus king thereof still living) by a ring; conditionally, that he
should sustain the charges, and maintain the wars that should happen
thereupon. In which regard he sucked a mass of money from our credulous king
Henry, who had so deeply swallowed the gudgeon that (his heart being ouer-ioyed
(says Matthew Paris) and raised even to the height of exultation) he swore by
Saint Edward, to make a present voyage to Apulia, and take possession of these
dominions. But at length this counterfeit ring upon the touch was discovered,
and the good king knew himself deluded, his Exchequer emptied, and this
Titulary-king his son Edmund abused. Thus writes Matthew Paris, the Monk of
S. Albans, who lived in those days; and deciphers the Legerdemaine, and
iugling devises of the Bishops of Rome to get money.

This Edmund was Lord Steward of this kingdom, and Lieutenant of Gascoigne.
Who being sent into Aquitaine with an army, where he performed notable
service, died at Bayon, in the year 1296. And within two months after his
death, his body was honorably transported into England.

Aueline Countess of Lancaster.
Here lies also entombed his first wife Aveline, daughter and heir of William
de Fortibus, Earl of Albamarle, by whom he had no issue: who died the year
1269.

Here lies buried in a most magnificent Tomb, befitting the greatness of his
birth, William de Valence Earl of Penbroke.
and the worthiness of his Offspring, William de valence, Earl of Penbroke,
(so surnamed of Valencia the place of his birth) son of Hugh le Brun, Earl
of the Marches of Aquitaine, and half brother by the mothers side, Stow Annal.
to King Henry the third. This William (says Stow) was slain at Bayon by the
French, in the year 1296. and with him, Edmund Earl of Lancaster, of whom I
lastly spoke, if we may believe these verses of Harding.

But earl Edmond, the kings brother dear,
With twenty and six baners proud and stout,
The fifth day of June was accounted clear, Harding ca. ^56

Of Christ his date a thousand year all out,
Fourscore and sixteen, without doubt.
At Bayon faught, with the French men certain,
Where he in the feld that day like a knight was slain.
So was Sir William Valence earl of Penbroke than,
Sir John Richmond, and many other Baron:
Sir John Saynct John, right a full manly manne:
Thenglishe host felly there was bore down,
By a bushement, laid by colucion,
That brake on them, sore fighting in the feld,
Out of a wode, in which that day were beld.
About the verge or side of his monument, these verses are inlayd with brass.

Anglia tota doles, moritur quia regia proles,
Qua florere soles, quem continet infima moles,
Guilielmus nomen insigne Valentia prebet,
Celsum cognomen, nam tale dari sibi debet.
Qui valuit validus, vincens virtute valor.
E^ placuit placidus, sensus morumque vigore,
Dapsilis, et habilis, immotus, prelia sectans,
Vtilis, ac humilis, deuotus, premia spectans.
Milleque trecentis cum quatuor inde retentis,
In Maij mense, hunc mors proprio ferit ense.
Quique legis hec repete quam sit via plena timore,
Meque lege, te moriturum and inscius hoar.
O clemens christ celos intret precor iste,
Nil videat triste, quia preculit omnibus hisce.
Here lies entombed the body of Simon Langham, Simon Langham Archbishop of
Canterbury.
who was first a Monk of this Abbey, then Prior, and lastly Abbot, thence
elected Bishop of London; from thence, before his consecration to London,
advanced to the Bishopric of Ely, and from that place removed to Canterbury:
he held diverse livings in commendam, as the Archdeaconry and Treasureship of
Wels, with others. He was both Treasurer and Chancelour of England at several
times: It is scarce credible (says Godwin now Bishop of Hereford in his
catalogue de presulibus Anglie) that is reported of his wonderful bounty and
liberality to this monastery. When he was first made Abbot, he bestowed all
that he had gathered together, being Monk and Prior, in paying the debt of the
house, which was to the value of two thousand and two hundred marks; and
discharged diverse other sums of money also, which particular Monks did owe:
he purchased good land which he gave unto them. When he went out of England,
he left them books to the value of 830 pound, and Copes, Vestments, and other
ornaments for the Church, worth 437. pound. At his death, he bequeathed unto
them, all his plate, prised at 2700. pound, and all his debts any where due,
which amounted unto 3954. pound, thirteen shillings and four pence. He also
sent unto this Abbey, the sum of one thousand marks, to buy forty marks a
year land, to increase the portion of four Monks, that daily should say
Mass for the souls of himself, and his Parents. The money that he bestowed
upon this Abbey one way or other, is reckoned by a Monk of the same, to be no
less then 10800. pound; who thereupon compiled this Distich.

Res es de Langham tua Simon sunt data quondam,
Octingentena librarum millia dena.
But men of eminent place and authority, cannot have their due praise of all
sorts of people; nay rather in requital of their best actions, they shall
reap nothing but opprobrious language: for upon his translation from Ely to
Canterbury, these two railing, riming Hexameters were made to his disgrace.

Letentur celi quia Simon transit ab Ely
Cuius in aduentum flent in Kent millia centum.
The Isle of Ely laughed, when Simon from her went:
But hundred thousands wept at's coming into Kent.
He sat Archbishop of Canterbury only two years, for being made Cardinal of
Saint Sixtus by Pope Urban the fifth, he left his Archbishopricke, and went to
Auinion, where shortly after he was made Bishop Cardinal of Preneste, by
Gregory the eleventh; where he lived in great estimation about eight years,
and died of a palsy, wherewith he was suddenly taken, as he sat at dinner,
July 22. 1376. he was buried first in the Church of the Carthusians, which he
himself had founded in the City of Auinion; but after three years, his bones
(by his appointment while he lived) were taken up and buried here a second
time, under a goodly tomb of Alabaster, upon which this Epitaph was sometime
engraven.

Simon de Langham sub petris hijs tumulatus,

Here lies Robert Waldby, Robert Waldby Archbishop of York.
who being a young man, followed Edward the black Prince into France, where he
continued long a Student, and profited so much, as no man in the University
where he lived, might compared with him for all kind of learning: he was a
good linguist, very well seen in Philosophy, both natural and moral, in
Physic, and the canon Law; very eloquent, an excellent Preacher; and esteemed
so profound a Divine, as he was thought meet to be the professor of Divinity,
or Doctor of the Chair in the University of Tholouze. For these his good
gifts he was much favored of the black Prince, then of King Richard his
son, who preferred him to the Bishopric of the Isle of Man, from that
preferment he was translated to the Archbishopricke of Dublin in Ireland,
thence to Chichester, and lastly to the Archbishopricke of York; where he sat
not fully three years, but died the 29. of May, 1397. His Epitaph is quite
worn or torn away from his monument, yet I found it in a Manuscript, in Sir
Robert Cottons Library.

In an old riming Manuscript of the succession of the Archbishops of York, I
find thus much of this man.

John Waltham Bishop of Salisbury. Ca^al. of Bishops.
Here under a marble stone in the Chapel royal, lies the body of John
Waltham, Lord Bishop of Salisbury, who had been master of the Rolls, keeper
of the privy Seal, and Treasurer of England: in which office he continued
till his death, which happened in the year 1395. having sat bishop 7 years,
and executed the Treasurorship four years. King Richard the second loved him
entirely, and greatly bewailed his death. In token whereof he commanded that
he should be buried here among the Kings: In vita R 2.
hoc anno, says Walshingham, viz. in the year 1395. obijt Johannes de Waltham
Episcopus Sarum and regni Thesaurarius qui tantum Regi complacuerit, vt etiam
(multis licet murmurantibus) apud monasterium inter Reges meruit sepulturam.

He lies in the pauement under a flat marble stone, just beside King Edward
the first, upon which, his Epitaph was inlayd in brass, with his portraiture
in Episcopal robes; now defaced, and almost quite perished.

Richard Wendouer Bishop of R^ch^ster.
Here lies another Bishop here buried (but not in so conspicuous and princely a
place of the Church, as does Waltham) who was likewise by the Kings special
commandment, here inhumed, for that he was accounted a very holy and virtuous
man; namely, one Richard de Wendouer, Parson of Bromley, and Bishop of
Rochester, who died in the year, 1250. and in the reign of King Henry the
third.

Sir Humphrey Bourchier, Lord Cromwell.
Here lies interred, Sir Humfrey Bourchier, Lord Cromwell, the son of Henry
Bourchier, Earl of Essex, by Isabell, daughter of Richard, Earl of Cambridge,
and sister to Richard, Duke of York; who in aid of his kinsman King Edward
the fourth, was slain at Barnet field upon Easter day, 1471.

Sir Humphrey Bourchier.
And here lies interred another Humfrey Bourchier, who was the son and heir
of John Bourchier, Lord Berners, who was also slain at the same battle; to
whose memories this Epitaph yet remains: Hic Pugil ecce iacens Bernet fera
bella cupiscens,
Certat vt Eacides, fit saucius vndique miles,
Vt cecidit vulnus, Mars porrigit arma cruore,
Sparsim tincta rubent, dolor en lachrimabilis hora,

Tho. Milling Bishop of Hereford.
Here lies entombed in a slight monument in the wall, Thomas Mylling, sometime
Abbot of this Monastery; from whence he was preferred to the Bishopric of
Hereford, by King Edward the fourth, under whom he was of the privy Council,
and was Godfather to Prince Edward his eldest Son; He was a Monk of this
house, being but a youth; and then went to Oxford, where he studied until he
proceeded Doctor of Divinity; in which time he attained good knowledge in the
Greek tongue; which in those days was geason, says the reverend Author of
the Bishops Catalogue. Godwin.
He died in the year 1493.

Here in an obscure place of this Church, Hugolin Chamberlain to S. Edward,
king and Confessor.
lies the body of Hugoline, Chamberlain to King Edward the Confessor, of whom
this Story is written in the life of the said Edward. King Edward one
afternoon lying in his bed with his curtains round about him drawn, a poor
pilfering Courtier came into his Chamber, where finding the Kings Casket open,
which Hugolin had forgotten to shut, he took out so much money as he could
well carry, and went away; but insatiable desire brought him again the second
and third time for such a ready prey: until the King (who lay still all this
while, and would not seem to see) began to speak to him, and bade him
speedily be packing, for he was well if he could see; for if Hugoline came and
took him there, he were not only like to loose all that he had gotten, but
also to stretch an halter. The fellow was no sooner gone, but Hugoline came in,
and finding the Casket open, and much money taken away, was greatly moved: But
the king willed him not to be grieved. For (said he) he that has it, has more
need of it then we have.

This Hugolin (says M. Camden) was buried in the old Chapter house of this
Church. Remains.
Upon whose Monument these silly verses were engraven.

Qui ruis unjust capit hic Hugoline locus te
Laud pia clares quia martyribus nece clare^.
For learning, in this kings days, was so low ebbed in England, that between
Thames and Trent, there was scant one found which could understand Latin.

This passage of the aforesaid pilfery is delineated, and wrought in the
Hangings about the Quire, with the Portraitures of the king, Hugolin, and the
Thief: under which are these verses.

Ecce nimis parca furis manus exit ab archa;
Celat opus furis, pietas, non regula iuris.

Here is an Epitaph cut in Brass upon a marble stone, now almost worn out,
Rob. Haule.
which was made to the memory of one Robert Haule Esquire, murdered in this
Church; the manner whereof our Chronicles do thus briefly relate. In the
battle of Nazers in Spain, this Robert Haule, or Hawley, and John Schakell
Esquires, took the Earl of Dene prisoner, who delivered unto them his son
and heir, as a pledge for assurance of performances. Not long after this,
their Hostage was demanded by John Duke of Lancaster, in the Kings name, whom
they denied to deliver, for which they were clapped in the Tower; from whence
escaping, here they took Sanctuary; to whom Sir Raph Ferreis, and Sir Alan
Buxhull, with fifty armed men, were secretly sent to do this mischief; who
finding them at high Mass; first drew Schakell by a wile, out of the
privilege of the Church, then offering to lay hands on Hawley; he manfully
resisting, with his short sword made them all fly off. But in the end he was
slain in the Chancell, commending himself, (...) vit. R. 2
in his last words, to God, the revenger of such injuries, and to the liberty
of our holy mother the Church. With him was slain a servant of his, thrust
into the back with a Iauelin; and a Monk who entreated for him in respect of
the holiness of the place. This wicked act was perpetrated; the 11. of August,
1378. the second of Richard the second. These words following now only
remaining upon his Monument.

Me dolus ira furor multorum; militis atque

Tho. Ruthall Bishop of Durham.
Hic iacet Thomas Ruthal Episcopus Dunelmensis, and Regis Henrici septimi
Secretarius, qui obijt 1524.

To this short Inscription, Godwin in his Catalogue adds a long story of the
life and death of this Bishop. Who was borne in Cicester (says he) in the
County of Gloucester, and brought up in Cambridge, where he proceeded Doctor of
Law. He was preferred to the Bishopric of Durham by King Henry the seventh;
after whose death he was made one of the privy Council unto the young King,
Henry the eight, who esteemed greatly of him, for his wisdom and learning;
and employed him often in ambassages, and other businesses of importance.
Amongst the rest it pleased the king one time, to require him to set down his
judgment in writing concerning the estate of his kingdom in general, and
particularly to inform him in certain things by him specified. This discourse
the Bishop writ very carefully, and caused it to be bound in Velime gilt, and
otherwise adorned in the best manner. Now you shall understand, that it chanced
himself about the same time, to set down a note of his own private estate,
which, in goods and ready money, amounted to the sum of one hundred thousand
pounds. This account was written in a paper book of the same fashion and
binding that the other was, which was provided for the king. Whereby it
happened that the king sending Cardinal Wolsey for the other draught, which he
had so long before required of him; the Bishop mistaking, delivered that which
contained an estimate of his own infinite Treasure. This the Cardinal soon
espying, and willing to do the Bishop a displeasure, delivered it as he had
received it unto the King, showing withal, how the Bishop had very happily
mistaken himself; for now (quoth he) you see where you may at any time command
a great mass of money, if you need it. As soon as the Bishop understood his
error, the conceit thereof touched him so near, that within a short spa^^
after he died, at his house here in the Strand. His intention was to have
repaired the Church of Cicester, to have built Bridges, as he had begun that
over the River of Tyne, and to have done many other deeds of charity, if he
had not been prevented by death.

Here lies the body of Sir William Trussell knight, Sir William Trussell

who could fit the house with quirks of Law, to color so lawless and
treasonable an act, as the deposing of a lawful king. And thereupon was chosen
in the behalf of the whole Realm, to renounce all homage and obedience to the
Lord Edward of Carnarvon, Lib. 7. cap. 43.
his Sovereign Lord and King. The form of which renunciation was by him the
said Trussell pronounced at Kenelworth Castle the 20. of January, 1326. in
these disgraceful words which you may find in Polychronicon.

The time of this Trussels death I cannot learn.

Here lies interred before the Communion Table, Rich. de Ware Abbot.
the body of Richard de Ware, or Warren, Abbot of this Monastery, and sometime
Lord Treasurer of England. Who going to Rome for his consecration, brought from
thence certain workmen, and rich Porphery stones; whereof and by whom he made
that curious singular rare pauement before the high Altar: Francis Thin. in
Catal. These. Aug.
in which are circulary written in letters of brass these ten verses
following, containing a discourse (as one says) of the worlds continuance. Si

With these stones and workmen, he did also frame the Shrine of Edward the
Confessor, with these verses. Anno milleno Domini cum septuageno,
Et bis centeno, cum completo quasi deno,
Hoc opus est factum quod Petrus duxit in actum
Romanus ciuis. Homo causam noscere si vis

This Abbot died the second day of December, 1283. after he had governed this
Monastery, three and twenty years and more. Upon whose grauestone this brief
Epitaph is engraven.

Abbas Richardus de Wara qui requiescit,
Hic portat lapides, quos hic portauit ab vrbe.

After the death of Richard de Ware, Walter Wenlocke was chosen Abbot, and
preferred to the honor of Lord Treasurer by King Edward the first. He was
Abbot six and twenty years, The Abbots of this house were Barons of the
Parliament.
lacking six days: died upon Christmas day at night, in the year 1307. And
lies buried under a marble stone: whereupon this Epitaph, to his high
commendation, is inlayed in brass.

Non fuit austerus, sed mitis, famine rectus.
Ric. de Barking Abbot.
Here lies Richard de Barking, Abbot of this Monastery, who was an especial
Counselor to King Henry the third, chief Baron of the Exchequer, and
Treasurer of England. Who having been Abbot 24. years, died the 23. day of
November, 1246. He was first buried in our Ladies Chapel in a Tomb of
marble, which was pulled down by Friar Comb, a Sacrist of this house. Who
laid a fair plain marble stone over him, with this Epitaph thus inscribed.

Gervaise de Bloys Abbot.
Here in the Cloister under a flat stone of black marble, lie the remains of
Gervais de Bloys, so called of the place or Earldom which his father possessed
in France: who was Stephen Earl of Bloys and Champaigne; afterward king of
England. He was his base son, begotten of one Dameta a gentlewoman of
Normandy. He was brought into England by his father the fifth year of his
reign; and in the same year made Abbot of this place. In which government he
continued for the space of twenty years. He deceased the 26. of August, 1160.
His Epitaph.

De Regem genere Pater hic Gervasius ecce
Monstrat de functus, mors rapit omne genus.
Even father Gervase borne of kings race;
Lo is dead, thus death all sorts does deface.
Here lies the body of Nicholas Litlington, Abbot of this house, who in the
time of his government, which was for the space of (...), years, built the
Abbots hall, and the fair room now called Jerusalem, the West and South part
of the Cloister, and a Granary, now the Scholars long Bedchamber, with the
Tower adjoining, as also the Water-Mill, and many other Edefices. He died Anno
1386. I found his Epitaph in a namelesse Manuscript, in that never enough
admired Library of Sir Robert Cotton.

Hacce Domo Ductor Nicholaus erat quoque structor

Here lies in the Cloister, one Vitalis, Vitalis Abbot.
Abbot of this Covent, preferred thereunto by William the Conqueror; in the
16. of whose reign, 1082. he died: upon whose Tomb this Epitaph was engraven,
alluding to his name, like as for Laurence his successor.

Qui nomen traxit a vita, morte vocante
Abbas Vitalis transijt, hicque iacet.
Here lies the body of one Lawrence, Laurence the first m^^erd Abbot of West.
Abbot of this Monastery, who obtained of Alexander the third (that ambitious
Bishop of Rome) to himself and his successors, the use of the Miter, the Ring,
and the Gloves; the Pastoral Staff, before his time, being their only
comportment, as by the differing portraitures of the Abbots upon their
Tombestones may be easily discerned. He died, Anno 1176. to whose memory, this
allusiue Epitaph was made.

Clauditur hoc tumulo vir quondam clarus in orb
Quo preclarus erat hic locus, est et erit.
Pro meritis vite dedit illi laurea nomen
Detur ei vite laurea pro meritis.
Here lies Gislebert Crispine, Gislebert Crispin Abbot.
Abbot, who flourished in the reign of King Henry the first, and died in the
year of our redemption, 1114. His picture is upon the grave stone, inlaid with
brass, with his Pastoral staff only, without Miter, Ring, or other ornament,
with these verses.

Hic Pater insignis, genus altum, virgo, senex que
Gisleberte iaces, lux, via, duxque tuis.
Mitis eras, iustus, prudens, fortis, moderatus,
Doctus quadriuio, nec minus in triuio.
Sic tamen ornatus nece sexta luce Decembris
Spiramen celo, reddis and ossa solo.
Here lies interred, the body of Edmund Kirton, Edmund Kirton Abbot.
Abbot of this Monastery, Doctor of Divinity, and a profound learned man: he
adorned Saint Andrews Chapel, wherein he lies buried, with the arms of
many of the English Nobility. These verses are inscribed upon his monument.

Pastor pacisicus, subiectis vir moderatus,
Hac sub marmorea Petra requiescit humatus,
Edmundus Kirton, hic quondam qui fuit Abbas,
Bis denis annis cum binis connumerandus;
Sacre Scripture doctor probus, immoprobatus,
Illustri stirpe de Cobildic generatus:
Coram Martino papa proposuit iste,
Ob quod multiplices lauds habuit and honores*
Qui obijt tertio die mensis Octobris An. Dom. M.cccc.lx.vi.
Eleison Kyry curando morbida mundi.
John Islip, Abbot.
John Islip, Abbot of Westminster, a man of great authority and special trust
with King Henry the seventh, lies here interred. He built the Deanes house as
now it is, and repaired many other places in this Monastery: in the windows
whereof (says Camden) he had a quadruple device for his single name; Remains.
for somewhere he set up an eye with a slip of a tree: in another place, one
slipping boughs in a tree; in other places, an I with the said slip; In bib
Cot.
and in some places, one slipping from a tree with the word, Islip. I cannot
learn the time of his death by his Tomb, yet I find in a Manuscript,
(wherein are diverse funeral collections, and other Inscriptions of this Abbey,
which were gathered about the time of the dissolution) that he died the second
of January, in the year 1510. the second of Henry the eight; and also that in
the Chapel of Saint Erasmus, where he lies buried, upon the wall over his
Tomb, was the picture of our Savior Christ, hanging on the Cross, seeming to
call and to give good council unto mankind in these rimes.

Aspice serve Dei sic me posuere Iudei.
Aspice deuote quoniam sic pendeo pro te.
Aspice mortalis pro te datur Hostia talis.
Introitum vite reddo tibi, read mihi te.
In cruce sum prote, qui peccas desine pro me,
Desine, do veniam, dic culpam, corrige vitam.
Under this Crucifixe, was the picture of the Abbot, holding up his hands, and
praying thus in old Poetry.

En cruce qui pendis Islip miserere Iohannis
Sanguine perfuso reparasti quem pretioso.
Raph Selby.
Here lies entombed, the body of Raph Selby, descended from the ancient family
of the Selbies of Billesdun in the County of Northumberland, a Monk of this
fraternity, a learned Doctor in the civil and canon laws, and one
exceedingly beloved and favored of King Henry the fourth, and Henry the fifth;
in the eight year of whose reign, he departed this world, Anno 1420. as by
this Epitaph appears.

Ecce Radulphus ita Selby iacet hic Cenobita,
Doctor per merita prepotens lege perita,
Legibus ornatus, a regibus et veneratus,
Ordo eiusque status per cum fit conciliatus.
M. C quater, x bis. post partum virginis iste
Michaelis festo tibi spirauit bone Christ.
Not far from this Selby, Io Windsore.
lies buried under a marble stone, the body of John Windsore, one of the noble
family of the Windsores, sometime residing at Stanwell in this County; a great
commander in the wars of Ireland, under Richard the second, and in the
battle of Shrewesbury, under King Henry the fourth: who died in the second
year of King Henry the fifth upon Eester Eve, the seventh of April, 1414. as
this Epitaph shows.

Est bis septenus M. Christi C quater. annus,
Vespera Paschalis dum septima lux fit Aprilis
Transijt a mundo Io. Windsore nomine notus,
Cord gemens mundo, confessus, crimine lotus:
Fecerat heredem Gulielmus auunculus istum.
Miles et Armigerum dignus de nomine dignum.
Dum iuuenilis erat bello multos perimebat:
Postea penituit and eorum vulnera fleuit.
Recumbens obijt, hic nunc in carcere quiescit:
Viuat in eternum Spiritus ante Deum.
But now I will conclude the funeral Monuments of this Abbey, Geffrey Chaucer
with the death and burial of our most learned English Poet, Geffery Chaucer,
whose life is written at large, by Thomas Speght, (who by old copies, reformed
his works) which the Reader may see a little before the beginning of his
books. He departed out of this world, the 25. day of October, in the year of
our Lord, 1400. after had lived 72. years. Thus writes Leland: Chaucer lived
till he was an old man, and found old age to be grievous: and whilst he
followed his causes at London, he died, and was buried at Westminster. The old
verses which were written on his grave at the first were these.

Galfridus Chaucer vates et fama Poesis
Materne, hac sacra sum tumulatus humo.
Thomas Occleue or Okelefe, of the office of the privy Seal, sometime
Chaucers scholar; for the love he bare to the said Geffray his master, caused
his picture to be truly drawn in his book De Regimine Principis; dedicated
to Henry the fifth; according to which, that his picture drawn upon his
Monument, was made, as also the Monument it self, at the cost and charges of
Nicholas Brigham gentleman, Anno 1555. who buried his daughter Rachell, a
child of four years of age, near to the Tomb of this old Poet, the 21. of
June 1557. such was his love to the Muses. But to return again to Chaucers
picture, to which these verses were added by the said Occleue.

Although his life be queint, the resemblaunce
Of him that has in me so fresh liveliness,
That to put other men in remembrance
Of his Person, I have here the likeness
Do make, to the end in soothfastnesse,
That they that of him have lost thought and mind,
By this Peniture may again him find.
The Inscriptions upon his Tomb at this day are after this manner.

Qui fuit Anglorum vates ter maximus olim
Galfridus Chaucer conditur hoc tumulo
Annum si quaeras Domini si tempora mortis
Ecce notae subsunt quae tibi cuncta notant:
25 Octobris, 1400.
Aerumnarum requies mors:
N Brigham hos fecit musarum nomine sumptus*
About the ledge of the Tomb, these verses were written.

Si rogitas quis era^, forsan te fama docebit
Quod si Fama negat, mundi quia gloria transit
Haec monumenta lege.
Now it shall not be amiss to add to these Epitaphs, the judgments and
reports of some learned men of this worthy and famous Poet: and first of all
let us hear his Scholar Occleue; Vir tam bonis liter^s, quam generis prosapia
clarus: these are his lines of him in his foresaid book de regimine Principis.

Alas my worthy master honorable,
This lands very treasure, and richesse,
Death by thy death has harm irreperable
Unto us done: her vengeable duresse,
Dispoiled has this land of the sweetness
Of Rhetorige: for unto Tullius,
Was never man so like among us.
Also who was heir in Philosophy
To Aristotle, in our tongue but thee?
The steps of Virgill in Poese
Thou suedst eken men know well enough:
What combre world that thee my master slough
Would I slain were.
John Lidgate, a Monk of Bury, in his Prologue of Bocchas, of the fall of
Princes by him translated, says thus in his commendation.

My Master Chaucer, with his fresh Comedies,
Is dead alas chief Poet of Britain,
That whilome made full pitous Tragedies,
The faule also of Princes he did complain,
As he that was of making sovereign;
Whom all this Land should of right prefer
Since of our Language he was the load-sterre.
That excellent and learned Scottish Poet, Gawyne Douglas, Bishop of Dunkeld,
in the Preface of Virgils Aeneados, turned into Scottish verse, does thus
speak of Chaucer.

Venerable Chaucer, principal Poet without pere,
Heavenly trumpet, orloge, and regulere,
In eloquence, baulme, conduct, and dyall
Milkie fountain, clear strand, and rose ryall.
Of fresh endite through Albione Island brayed
In his legend of noble Ladies said.
Spenser in his Fairie Queen calls his writings, The works of heavenly wit.
Concluding his commendation in this manner.

Dan Chaucer, Well of English, undefiled,
On Fames eternal beadrole worthy to be filed.
Sir Philip Sidney likewise, and M. Camden speak much in the deserved praise
of this worthy Poet, whom I leave to his eternal rest.

Under the Clock in the Church, I have read this Inscription.

Dic mihi quid prodest horas numerare fugaces
Cum cessant perdas quod numerare libet.
This Church has had great privilege of Sanctuary within the precinct
thereof (as Stow says in his Suruay of London) to wit, the Church, Churchyard,
Close, and all that which is still called the Sanctuary. Which Privilege was
first granted by Sebert king of the East Saxons, the first Founder thereof.
Since increased by Edgar King of the West Saxons, renewed and confirmed by King
Edward the Confessor, as appears by this his Charter following.

Edward by the grace of God, king of Englishmen: I make it to be known to all
generations of the world after me, that by especial commandment of our holy
Father Pope Leo; I have renewed, and honored the holy Church of the blessed
Apostle, Saint Peter of Westminster; and I order and establish for ever, that
what person, of what condition or estate soever he be, from whencesoeuer he
come, or for what offense or cause it be, either for his refuge into the said
holy place, he be assured of his life, liberty, and limbs. And over this I
forbid (under the pain of everlasting damnation) that no Minister of mine, or
of my Successors, intermeddle them with any the goods, lands, or possessions
of the said persons taking the said Sanctuary: for I have taken their goods and
liuelode into my special protection; and therefore I grant to every each of
them (in as much as my terrestrial power may suffice) all manner freedom of
joyous liberty, and whosoever presumes, or does contrary to this my Grant: I
will he lose his name, worship, dignity and power. And that with the great
traitor Judas, that betrayed our Savior, he be in the everlasting fire of
hell. And I will, and ordain, that this my grant endure as long, as there
remains in England, either love, or dread of Christian name.

King Edward the third built in the little Sanctuary, a Clochard of stone and
timber, and placed therein three bells, for the use of Saint Stephens Chapel.
About the biggest Bell was engraven, or cast in the metal, these words: King
Edward made me thirty thousand weight and three:
Take me down and wey me, and more you shall find me.
But these Bells being to be taken down, in the reign of King Henry the
eight, one writes underneath with a coal: But Henry the eight, will bait me of
my weight.


In the Steeple of the great Church in the City of Roane in Normandy is one
great Bell with the like Inscription.

Ie suis George de Ambios
Qui trente cinque mill pois
Mes lui qui me pesera
Trente six mill me trouera.
I am George of Ambois,
Thirty five thousand in pois:
But he that shall weigh me,
Thirty six thousand shall find me.
One lately having taken view of the Sepulchers of so many Kings, Nobles, and
other eminent persons interred in this Abbey of Westminster, made these rimes
following, which he called A Memento for Mortality.
Mortality behold and fear,
What a change of flesh is here?
Think how many royal bones,
Sleep within this heap of stones,
Hence removed from beds of ease,
Dainty ^are, and what might please,
Fretted roofes, and costly shows,
To a roof that flats the nose:
Which proclaims all flesh is grass,
How the worlds fair Glories pass:
That there is no trust in Health,
In youth, in age, in Greatness, wealth:
For if such could have repriu'd,
Those had been immortal lived.
Know from this the worlds a snare,
How that greatness is but care,
How all pleasures are but pain,
And how short they do remain:
For here they lie had Realms and Lands,
That now want strength to stir their hands;
Where from their pulpits seel'd with dust
They preach. In Greatness is no trust.
Here Is an Aker sown indeed,
With the richest royal seed,
That the earth did ere suck in,
Since the first man died for sin,
Here the bones of birth have cried,
Though Gods they were, as men have died.
Here are sands (ignoble things)
Dropped from the ruined sides of Kings;
With whom the poor man's earth being shown,
The difference is not easily known.
Here Is a world of pomp and state,
Forgotten, dead, disconsolate;
Think then this Sith that mowes down kings,
Exempts no meaner mortal things.
Then bid the wanton Lady tread,
Amid these mazes of the dead.
And these truly understood,
More shall cool and quench the blood,
Then her many sports a day,
And her nightly wanton play.
Bid her paint till day of doom,
To this favor she must come.
Bid the Merchant gather wealth,
The usurer exact by stealth.
The proud man beat it from his thought,
Yet to this shape all must be brought.


Chapel of our Lady in the Piew.
Near unto the Chapel of Saint Stephen, was sometime a smaller Chapel,
called our Lady of the Piew: but by whom first founded I cannot find. To this
Lady great offerings were used to be made. Richard the second after the
overthrow of Wat. Tilar (as I have read) and other the Rebels, Ex Mss. in bib.
Cot.
in the fourth of his reign, went to Westminster, and there giving thanks to
God for his victory, made his offering in this Chapel. By the negligence of a
Scholar, forgetting to put forth the Lights of this Chapel, the Image of our
Lady, richly decked with Jewels, precious stones, Pearls, and Rings, more then
any Ieweller (says he) could judge the price, was, with all the apparel and
ornaments belonging thereunto, as also the Chapel it self, burnt to ashes.
It was again reedified by Antony Wid^uile, Earl Rivers, Lord Scales, Uncle
and Governor to the Prince of Wales, that should have been King Edward the
fifth Who was unjustly beheaded at Pomfret by the procurement of Richard
Crook-backe, Duke of Gloucester, then Lord Protector, the 13. of June, 1483.

Saint Margaret in Westminster.
Adjoining on the North side of the Abbey, stands Saint Margarets, the Parish
Church of the City of Westminster, reedified for the most in the reign of
King Edward the fourth, especially the South Isle, from the piety of the Lady
Marye Billing, and her second husband Sir Thomas Billing, chief Justice of
England in that Kings time. Whose Monument with that, to the memory of her
first husband William Cotton, Esquire, I have here expressed.



Here lies Dame Mary Bylling, late wife to Sir Thomas Bylling, Knight, chief
Justice of England, and to William Coton, and Thomas Lacy: which Mary died the
14.day of March, in the year of our Lord God, 1499.
Blessed Lady, etc. have mercy, etc.

Ant Mary gratia plena

The inheritance of this Lady, was the Lordship of Connington in
Huntingtonshire. The seat once of Turketell, the Dane, Earl of the East
Angles, who invited over Swain King of Denmark, to invade this kingdom. He
exi^'d with most of his Nation, by Saint Edmond the Confessor. This his seat,
with other his large possessions, were given by the same King to Walth^o^ Earl
of Northumberland and Huntington, to whom the first William gave in marriage,
the Lady Iudithe, his sisters daughter. This Lordship with the Earldom of
Huntington, by the marriage of Mary that Earls daughter, to David the son of
the first Malcolme, King of Scots, and the holy Margaret his wife, Niece to
Edward the King, Confessor, Grandchilde to Edmond, surnamed Ironside, King of
the English Saxons, and sister and heir to Edgar surnamed Ethelinge, by which
marriage, the Stem Royal of the Saxons, became united into the blood Royal
of the Scottish Kings; in whose male line, that Earldome, and this Lordship
continued until Isabell, the daughter and heir of David Earl of Huntington,
and brother to Malcome, William, and Alexander, successiue Kings of that
kingdom, brought them both by her marriage to Robert de Brus, into that family.

She leaving the just claim of the Crown of Scotland, to Robert her eldest
son, whose son Robert the third, thereof obtained full possession: in right
from whom, our sacred sovereign King Charles is lineally to the same Crown
descended. And to her second son, Bernard de Brus, she gave this Lordship of
Connington, with other large possessions in England, which after four descents
in that Stem, was by marriage of Anne, the daughter and heir of Sir John de
Brus, to Sir Hugh Welengham, brought into that family, who after three descents
by the marriage of Mary, the daughter and heir of the last of that surname, it
came to William, second son of Sir Richard Cotton of Ridware, in the County
of Stafford. From whom Sir Robert Cotton, Knight and Baronet, is lineally to
that Lordship of Connyngton now descended.

Hereby appears the much mistaking of many, who hold that the first King of
the Norman race, cancelled with his sword, all claim of Inheritances before
his entrance, whereas in truth he neither altered the fundamental laws or
liberties of the Kingdom, or fortunes of any, but of those that sided with
Harrold against him in his claim. For the words of his own great Charter
under seal, made the day of his Coronation, are; Deuicto Harraldo Rege cum
suis complicibus in ore gladij: over whom only he declares his conquest, but
his Title was beneficio concessionis beati regis Edwardi cognati sui. And that
he acknowledges as his right: And we cannot pass over a dutiful and
thankful remembrance unto God, who in his divine justice, after the course of
little more then 500. years, has restored again in the sacred person of King
James, of happy memory, the lyneall Royal race, and blood of the Saxon
Monarchy. In him uniting the Briton, Saxon, Norman, and Scottish Regal blood,
and by him restoring not only the name, but the ancient dignity of the
Britain Empire: fulfilling that old presage of Aquila, recorded many hundred
years ago.

Regnabunt Britones Albani Gentis amici
Antiquum nomen Insula tota feret
Vt profert Aquila veteri de turre Loquta
Cum Scotis Britones regna paterna regent
Regnabunt pariter in prosperitate quieta
Hostibus expulsis Iudicis vsque diem.
Of which we have a most happy assurance, by the now blessed issue of our most
gracious and dread Sovereign King Charles, who has crowned thereby this state
with an eternal peace.

Johannes Skeltonus vates Pierius hic situs est animam Eijcit^*
egit, 21 Iunij 1529.

This John Skeleton was that pleasant merry Poet (as his rimes yet extant do
testify) who styled himself Johannes Skeltonus Orator regius, Io. Skeleton
Poet Laureat*
Poeta laureatus. He flourished in the reigns of Henry the seventh, and Henry
the eight, by whom, in the Quire, Thomas Churchyard, that old Court-Poet lies
interred, and not in the Church Porch, as these rimes following would approve.

Come, Alecto, and lend me thy Torch,
To find a Church yard in a Church porch.
Poverty and Poetry, this Tomb does enclose,
Therefore Gentlemen, be merry in Prose.
I find in the collections of Master Camden, that there was some unkind
passages betwixt this Poet laureat Skeleton, and Lily our sole authenticke
allowed Gramarian; in so much, that Skeleton carping against the verses of the
said Lily, is (bitterly) by him thus answered.

Lilij endecasillaba in Skeltonum
Eius carmina calumniantem.
Quid me Skeltone front sic aperta
Carpis vipereo potens veneno?
Quid versus trutina meos iniqua
Libras? dicere vera number licebit?
Doctrinae tibi dum parare famam,
Et doctus fieri studes Poeta;
Doctrinam nec habes, nec es Poeta.
Almes-houses of Henry the 7.
On the South side of the Gate House, King Henry the 7. founded an Almes-house
for thirteen poor men, one of them to be a Priest* aged five and forty
years, a good Gramarian: the other 12 to be aged fifty years, without wives:
every Saturday the Priest to receive of the Abbot or Prior, four pence by the
day, and each other, two pence half penny by the day for ever, for their
sustenance; and every year to each one, a Gown and a hood ready made. And to
three women that dressed their meat, and kept them in their sickness, each to
have every Saturday sixteen pence, and every year a Gown ready made. More to
the thirteen poor men yearly, fourscore quarters of Coals, and one
thousand of good Fagots to their use. In the Hall and Kitchen of their mansion,
a discreet Monk to be ouerseer of them, and he to have forty shillings by the
year, etc. and hereunto was every Abbot and Prior sworn.

An Almes-house founded by Margaret, Countess of Richmond.
Westward from the Gate house, was an old Chapel of Saint Anne, over against
the which, the Lady Margaret, Countess of Richmond and Derby, and mother to
King Henry the seventh, erected an Almes-house for poor women, which was
afterward turned into lodgings for the Singing men of the College. the place
wherein this Chapel and Almes-house stood, was called the Eleemosinary or
Almory, now corruptly the Ambry, for that the alms of the Abbey was there
distributed to the poor.

An Hospital founded by Lady Anne Dacre.
At the entry into Totehill field, was sometimes an old building, called
Stourton house, which Giles, Lord Dacre of the South, purchased and built new,
whose Lady and wife Anne, Sister to Thomas Lord Buckhurst, the first of that
Family, Earl of Dorset, left money to her Executours, to build an Hospital
there for twenty poor women, and so many children to be brought up under
them. For whose maintenance she assigned Lands, to the value of one hundred
pounds by the year.

Almes-houses founded by Cornelius Van Dun.
In the same field, upon Saint Hermits hill, and near unto a Chapel of Saint
Mary Magdelen, now wholly ruinated; Cornelius van Dun borne at Breda in
Brabant, a Soldier with King Henry the eight at Turney, yeoman of the Guard,
and Usher to the said King Henry, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, Kings and
Queens of famous memory: built certain Almes-houses for twenty poor widows
to dwell in rent free. He died in September, An. 1577. aged 94. years.

The Hermitage, Hospital, and Free-Schoole at Highgate-hill.
In ancient times upon the top of this hill was an Hermitage; one of the
Hermites whereof, caused to be made the Causway between Highgate and
Islington, taking the gravel from the top of the hill, where now is a standing
pond of water.

One William Poole Yeoman of the Crown, founded the Hospital below on the
hill, in the reign of King Edward the fourth.

The free School was built by Sir Roger Cholmundely, or Cholmeley, knight,
Specul. Brit.
sometime Lord chief Justice of the Kings Bench; about the year 1564. the
sixth of Queen Elizabeth. The Pencion of the Master is uncertain (says
Norden) there is no Usher, and the School is in the disposition of six
Governors, or Overseers.

Our Ladies Chapel of Muswell, or Mousewell hill.
Here was, in ancient times, a Chapel bearing the name of our Lady of
Muswell; in the place whereof Alderman Roe erected a fair house. The place
takes name of the Well, and of the Hill; for there is on the hill a spring of
fair water, which is now within the compass of Sir Nicholas Roes Cellar, in
the said house. Here was sometime an Image of our Lady of Muswell, whereunto
was a continual resort, in the way of pilgrimage, growing (as it goes by
tradition from father to the son) in regard of a great cure, which was
performed by this water, upon a king of Scots, who being strangely diseased,
was (by some divine intelligence) advised to take the water of a Well in
England, called Muswell; which, after long scrutation and inquisition, this
Well was found, and performed the cure. Absolutely to deny the cure (says
Norden) I dare not, for that the high God has given virtue unto waters, to
heal infirmities, as may appear by the cure of Naaman the Leper, 2. King.
1.14. Ioh. ^.2.
by washing himself seven times in Jordan; and by the Poole Bethesda, which
healed the next that stepped thereinto, after the water was moved by the Angel.

The Hermitage at Kilbourne.
In the time of King Henry the first, Herbert Abbot of Westminster, by
permission of Gilbert Bishop of London, and by consent of the Covent, granted
to three Maids the Hermitage of Kilbourne, with all the land of that place;
which Hermitage one Gorbone had builded long before.

The Hospital of S. Giles in the Fields for Leprous people.
This Hospital was founded by Queen Maude, wife to king Henry the first, Stow
Suruay.
in the year 1117. and was a Cell belonging to Burton Lazers of Jerusalem, in
the County of Leicester; as may appear by a deed dated the 24. of Hen. 7. in
these words.

Thomas Norton knight, Master of Burton Lazers of Jerusalem in England, and the
brethren of the same place, keepers of the Hospital of Saint Giles, without
the Bars of the old Temple of London; have sold to Geffrey Kent, Citizen, and
Draper of London, a message or house with two Sollars above, edified in the
Parish of Alhallowes Hony-Jane in Westcheape, adjoining to the West part of a
Tenement, called the Goat on the Hope, pertaining to the Drapers of London,
for 31. l.

S. Giles Bowl.
At this Hospital the prisoners, conveyed from the City of London toward
Teyborne, there to be executed, were presented with a great Bowl of Ale,
thereof to drink at their pleasure.

The Hospital of Saint Mary Bethlem, commonly called Bedlam.
In the year 1247. Simon Fitzmary, one of the Sheriffs of London, founded
this Hospital for lame and indigent people, which afterward was converted to
that use, which the City now makes of it, upon this occasion.

In the Parish of Saint Martins in the field, there was an house wherein
sometime were distraught and Lunaticke people; of what antiquity founded, by
whom, or what time suppressed, says Stow, I have not read. But it was said,
that a King of England, not liking such a kind of people to remain so near
his Palace, caused them to be removed further off, to Bethlem without
Bishopsgate of London, and to that Hospital the said house by ^haring-crosse
does yet remain.

S. Peter's Chapel within the Tower.
Here lie interred the headless remains of John Fisher Doctor of Divinity,
sometime Bishop of Rochester, brought up a Scholar in Cambridge; Master of our
College (I mean Queens College in Cambridge) and Chancellor of that
University. He was made Cardinal t t. S. Vitalis, the one and twentieth of
May, which honor was to him parum vitalis, for the Cardinals hat and his head
never met together; he being beheaded on the Tower Hill the 22. of June
following, Ann. Dom. 1535. His body was first buried in Barking Churchyard,
and afterward upon occasion as follows, removed to this place.

He was a man in great estimation with Margaret Countess of Richmond, by whose
exhortation she built and endowed two Colleges in Cambridge, S. John's, and
Christ College; she made him one of her executours. He lived likewise a long
time in great favor with her Grandchild King Henry the eight; even until his
marriage with Anne Bullein; which he ever seemed to disallow. Whereupon he was
suspected, and accused, to be of council with Elizabeth Barton (commonly
called the holy Maid of Kent) a Nun of Saint Sepulchers in Canterbury, who
by sundry suggestiue revelations gave out, that if the King proceeded in
divorce and second marriage, he should not reign in his realm seven months
after, nor rest in Gods favor the space of an hour. The story is frequent. Of
which imputation he thus excused himself by his letters to the Kings Majesty.

To the Kings most gracious Highness.
Please it your graciouse Highenes benignely to hear this my most humble suit,
The Bishop of Rochester^ letter to (...) S. amongst the letters (...) In bib.
Cotton.
which I have to make unto your grace at this time, and to pardon me that I
come not my self unto your grace for the same. For in good faith I have had so
many periculouse diseases, oone after another, which began with me before
Advent; and so by long continuance has now brought my body into that
weakness, that withouten peril of destruction of the same (which I darr say
your grace for your sovereign goodness would not) I may not as yet take any
traueyling upon me. And so I wrote to Master Cromwell your most trusty
Councellor, Cromwell principal^ Secretary.
beseeching him to obtain your graciouse license for me, to be absent from
this Parliament, for that same cause, and he put me in comforthe so to do.

Now thus it is (most graciouse soueraygne Lord) that in your most high Court
of Parliament is put in a bill against me, concerning the Nun of Canterbury,
and intending my condempnation for not reuelyng of such words as she had
unto me towchyng your Highness. Wherein I most humbly beseech your grace, that
without displeasor I may show unto you, the consideration that moved me so to
do; which when your most ex^cellent wisdom has deaplye considered, I trust
assuredly, that your charitable goodness will not impute any blame to me
therefore.

A trowth it is, this Nun was with me thries in coming from London by
Rochester, as I wrote to Master Cromwell, and showed unto him the occasions of
her coming, and of my sendings until her again.

The first time she came unto my house, unsent for of my party, and then she
told me that she had been with your grace, and that she had showed unto
you a revelation which she had from Almighty God (your grace I hope will not
be displeased with this my rehearsal thereof) She said that if your grace went
forth with the purpose that ye intended, ye should not be King of England seven
months after.

I conceived not by these words, I take it upon my soul, that any malice or
evil was intended or meant unto your highness, by any mor all man, butt oonly
that they were the threattes of God, as she than did affirm.

And though they were feaned, that (as I would be saved) was to me unknown. I
never counsailled her unto that feanyng, not was privaye thereunto, nor to any
such purposes, as it is now said they went about.

Nevertheless if she had told me this Revelation, and had not alsoo told
me, that she had reported the same unto your grace, I had been verylie
far to blame, and worthy extreme punishment, for not disclosing the same
unto your highenes, or else to some of your counsel; But sithen she did
assure me therewith, that she had playnelye told unto your grace the same
thing, I thought doubtless that your grace would have suspected me that I had
commyn to renew her tale again unto you, rather for the confermyng of mine
opinion, than for any other cause.

I beseech your highenes to take no displeasor with me for this that I will
say. It stykketh yet (most graciouse Soueraygne) in my heart, to my no little
heaviness your grievous letters, and after that your most fearful words,
that your grace had unto me for showing unto you my mind and opinion in the
same matter. Notwithstanding that your highness had so often and so
straytly commanded me to search for the same before. And for this cause I was
right loath to have common unto your grace again, with such a tale pertaining to
that matter.

Meny other considerations I had, but this was the very cause why that I came
not unto your grace. For in good faith, I dradde lest I should thereby have
provoked your grace to farther displeasor against me.

My Lord of ^il. Warbam
Canterbury also which was your great Counsaillor, told me that she had been
with your grace, and had showed you this same matter, and of him (as I will
answer before God) I learned greatter things of her pretensed visions than
she told me herself. And at that same time I shewede unto him, that she had
been with me, and told me as I have written before.

I trust now that your excellent wisdom and learning sees there is in me no
defawte, for not revelling of her words unto your grace; when she her self
did affirm unto me that she had so done, and my Lord of Canterbury that
then was, confermed alsoo the same.

Wherefore most graciouse Soueraygne Lord, in my most humble wise I beseech your
highenes to dimisse me of this trouble, whereby I shall the more quietly serve
God, and the more effectually pray for your grace; This, if there were a right
great offense in me, should be to your merit to pardon, but much rather taking
the case as it is, I trust verily you will so do.

Now my body is mvch weakened with meny diseases and infirmities, and my soul
is much inquieted by this trouble, so that my heart is more withdrawn from
God, and fro the devotion of prayer than I would. And verily I think that my
lyve may not long continewe. Wherefore estsoones I beseech your most gracious
highenes, that by your charytable goodness I may be delivered of this business,
and only to prepare my soul to God, and to make itt ready against the coming
of death, and no moore to come abroode in the world. This most graciouse
Sovereign Lord, I beseech your highenes, by all the singular and excellent
endewments of your most noble body and soul, and for the love of Christ Jesus,
that so dearly with his most preciouse blood redeamed yowr and mine. And
during my live I shall not cease (as I am bownden) and yett now the more
entearly to make my prayer to God for the preservation of your most royal
Majesty.

At Rochester, the xxvii. day of February. Your most humble Beadman and
subject, Io. Roffe.


He writ likewise to the high Court of Parliament (then sitting) to the same
effect: but before this business was fully finished, another came upon him, In
part Anno 2^ Hen. 8. ca. 10.
which was the oath of Supremacy; the refusing whereof, being tendered, was
adjudged high treason. This oath, or some part of it, he denies, whereupon he
is committed to the Tower, from whence he thus writes to Cromwell.

After my most humble commendations, Ex lit in Bib. Cotton.
where as ye covet that I should write unto the Kings Highness, in good faith,
I dread me that I cannot be so circumspect in my writing, but that sum word
shall escape me, wherewith his grace shall be moved to sum further displeasure
against me, whereof I would be very sorry: For, as I will answer by for God, I
would not in any manner of point offend his grace, my duty saved unto God, whom
I must in every thing prefer. And for this consideration, I am full loath and
full of fear to write unto his highness in this matter. Nevertheless sythen
I conceive that it is your mind that I shall so do, I will endeavor me to the
best that I can. But first here I must beseech you good master Secretary, to
call to yowr remembrance, that at my last being before you, and the other
Commissioners, for taking of the oath concerning the Kings most noble
succession, I was content to be sworn unto that parcel concerning the
succession. And there I did rehearse this reason, which I sade moved me. I
dowted not, but that the Prince of any Realm, with the assent of his nobles
and commons, might appoynte for his succession Royal, such an order as was
seen unto his wysdom most according. And for this reason, I sade, that I was
content to be sworn unto that part of the oath as concerning the succession.
This is very trowth, as God help my sowl at my most need. Albeit I refused to
swear to some other parcels, because that my conscience would not serve me so to
do. Furthermor I byseche you to be good master unto me in my necessity, for I
have nether Shirt, nor Suit, nor yet other clothes that are necessary for me to
wear; but that be ragged and torn to shamefully. Notwithstanding I might
easily suffer that, if they would keep my body warm. But my dyett also, God
knows, how slender itt is at meny times. And now in mine age, my stomach may
not away but with a few kind of meats, which if I want, I decay forthwith, and
fall into coffes and diseases of my body, and cannot keep my self in health.
Robert Fisher.
And, as our Lord knows, I have nothing left unto me for to provide any
better, but as my Brother of his own purse lays out for me, to his great
hynderance.

Wherefore, good Master Secretary, estsones I byseche you to have some pity
upon me, and latt me have such things as are necessary for me in mine age; and
especially for my health. And also that itt may please you by yowr high wysdom,
to move the Kings highness to take me unto his gracious favor again, and to
restor me unto my liberty, out of this cold and painful imprisonment; whereby
ye shall bynd me to be yowr pore beadsman for ever unto almighty God, who ever
have you in his protection and custody.

Other twain things I must also desyer upon you, first oon is, that itt may
please you that I may take some Priest within the Tower, by the assignment of
master Liuetenant, to hear my confession against this holy tym.

That other is, that I may borrow some books to stir my devotion mor
effectually these holy days, for the comfortte of my sowl. This I byseche you
to grant me of yowr charity. And thus our Lord send you a merry Christenmas, and
a comfortable to yowr hearts desyer.

At the Tower this xxii. day of December. Your poor Beadsman, John Roffe.


Thus he lay imprisoned, in great misery, hungry, cold, and comfortless, as
the prisoners dittie in Newgate runs, until the time of his arraignment:
during which time, as also before, being diverse times examined by the Lords of
the privy Council, Ex Mss. in bib. Cot.
as also examined and sworn in verbo Sacer docij, by Thomas Bedyll, and
Richard Layton, Clerks of the Kings Council, in the presence of Sir Edmond
Walfingham, knight, Lieuetenant of the Tower, and others, to many
Interrogatories, his answers were ever agreeable in effect, with his letters.

He was arraigned only for denying of the Supremacy (howsoever he was before
attainted by Parliament, of misprision of Treason, for the matter of the holy
Maid of Kent) as by this his Indictment appears, of which so much as is
material.

Of this Indictment being found guilty, he had judgment, whereupon execution
presently followed; which the more was hastened, as also his arraignement, in
regard of the rumor that a Cardinals hat was coming toward him from the
Pope, Ex Mss. in bib. Cotton.
because he had stood so stoutly in his defense: which news was so unwelcome
unto him, that upon the first report thereof coming to his ears, he said in
the presence of some of the Lieuetenants servants, that if the Cardinals hat
were laid at his feet, he would not stoop to take it up, so little did he set
by it: but let us leave him to his eternal rest, only thus much out of the
writers of his time, who say, that he was omnium Episcopalium Virtutum genere
suffarcinatissimus, Eras.
et singulari linguae gratia praeditus.

He was of many, Vid. Bal. cent. 5.
sore lamented, being a man of a very good life, and great learning, as his
writings in diverse books did testify. The common people had such a reverend
opinion of his holiness, that they believed certain miracles to be wrought by
his head put upon a Pole, and set up upon London Bridge.

The sixth day of July following the decollation of Bishop Fisher, Sir. Tho.
Moore.
Sir Thomas More, Lord Chancellor of England, was likewise beheaded on the
Tower hill, for the like denial of the Kings Supremacy: he was first buried
in this Chapel, and the body of his dear friend Fisher was removed out of
Barking Churchyard, and buried with him in the same grave: for agreeing so
unanimously in their opinions living, it was (be like) thought unfitting to
part them being dead; but how long they lay together in this their house of
rest, I certainly know not: yet this is certain, that Margaret, the wife of
Master Roper, and daughter of the said Sir Thomas More, remoted her fathers
corpse, not long after, to Chelsey; and whether she honouued the Bishop by
another remove to the place of her fathers burial, or not, I know not; yet she
might, by all probability.

They were both accused to be of the adherents to Elizabeth Barton in her
counterfeite holiness, hypocrisy, and traitorous intents; but their
innocence, and their often writing to the King and Cromwell, in their own
excuse, acquitted them of that imputation.

In parl. Anno 26 Hen. 8. ca. 2.
In the Act for the surety of the succession of the Crown of England, an oath
was devised for the maintenance and defense of the said Act, which was to be
taken by all the Kings subjects; this oath being tendered to these two, they
were content to be sworn to the maine point, but not to the preamble of the
said Oath, which I have touched before; of which, Cranmer Archbishop of
Canterbury, thus delivers his opinion by his letter to Secretary Cromwell: if
I now digress, I crave a favorable construction.

Ex lit. in Bib. Cotton.
Right worshipful Master Cromwell, after most hearty commendations, etc. I
doubt not but you do right well remember, that my Lord of Rochester, and
master More, were contented to be sworn to the Actt of the Kings succession,
but not to the preamble of the same: what was the cause of their refusal
thereof, I am uncertain, and they would by no means express the same.
Nevertheless it must nedis be, either the diminution of the authority of the
Bishop of Rome, or else the reprobation of the Kings first pretensed matrimony.
But if they do obstinately persiste in their opinions of the preamble, yet me
seems it scholde not be refused, if they will be sworn to the very act of
succession; so that they will be sworn to mayntene the same against all powers
and Potentates. For hereby shall be a great occasion to satisfy the Princess
Dowager, and the Lady Mary, which do think that they should dampne their
sowles, if they should abandon and relinquish their astats. And not only it
should stop the mouths of thaym, but also of the emperor, and other tha^r
friends, if they give as much credence to my Lord of Rochester, and master More
spekyng or doing against thaym, as they hitherto have done and thought, that
all other should have done when they spoke and did with thaym. And peradventure
it should be a good quietation to many other within this Realm, if such men
should say that the succession comprised within the said act is good, and
according to Gods laws. For than I think there is not one within this Reaulme
that would ones reclaim against it. And where as diverse persons either of a
wilfulness, will not, or of an indurate and inuertible conscience can not,
altre from their opinions of the Kings first pretensed marriage, (wherein they
have ones said their minds, and percase have a persuasion in their heads, that
if they should now vary therfrome, their fame and estimation were distained for
ever) or else of the authority of the Busschope of Rome: yet if all the
Reaulme with one accord would apprehend the said succession, in my judgment it
is a thing to be amplected and embraced, which thing, although I trust surely
in God, that it shall be brought to pass, yet hereunto might not a little
avail the consent and oaths of these two persons the Busshope of Rochester,
and Master More with their adherents, or rather confederats: And if the Kings
pleasure so were, their said oaths might be suppressed, but when and where his
highness might take some commodity by the publyshinge of the same. Thus our
Lord have you ever in his conservation.

From my Manner at Croydon, the xvii day of April. Your own assured ever,
Thomas Cantuar.


Here in this letter is to be seen the wisdom and policy of this prudent
Archbishop, who could make such available use to the state, of the strong
opinion, which most men conceived, of the profound judgment of these two
persons.

This Sir Thomas More was pregnant of wit, Scrip. B^^t. Cent. 5. De I^ust.
Angie Scriptoribus
eloquent, wise, and learned, as by his books still extant does appear: and
besides those mentioned by Bale, which we have in print. During the time of his
imprisonment, which was fourteen months (says Pitseus) he writ an
historical exposition of the Passion of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
according to the four Evangelists. Which I can hardly believe: for I find,
that when he was in prison, his books and all his papers were taken away from
him. Whereupon he shut up his Chamber-windowes, saying, When the wares are
gone, and the tools taken away, we must shut up shop. Thus would he lose his
light before he would lose his jest; for that he would never lose nor leave
off, upon the least occasion offered, until he had lost his head.

He was twice married, In Epist. ad Vldric. Huttenum de vita Mori.
first, (says Erasmus his intimate dear friend) Virginem daxit admodum
puellam, claro genere natam; He married a Maid very young, borne of a noble
Family, whom he took care to have instructed in all good literature, and to
be expert in all sorts of Music; by her he had four children; one Son
named John, and three daughters: Margaret, Alice, or Aloysia, and Cicely.

God (says Leland that reverend Antiquarie, that lived in his days)
extraordinarily blessed these his children, and namely, his three daughters, to
whom he had given an admirable dexterity, in the science of Songs and Arts:
which he notes in this his learned Epigram. Desine facundas nimium laudare
diserti Io. Lelandi Moriades, sieve charitaea cor^na.

Natas Hortensi maxima Roma tui.
Candida tres charites nam Mori cura politi
Obscurant multis nomina vestra modis.
Non illis studium Milesia vellera dextra
Carpere, non facili ducere fila manu:
Sed innat eloquij crebro monumenta latini
Versare, and doctis pingere verba notis.
Nec minus authors Graecos euoluere, Homerum
Et quem dicendi gloria prima manet.
Vt nec Aristotelis dicam quo pectore libros
Scrutentur, sophiae mystica dona deae.
Turpe viris posthac erit ignorare Mineruae
Arts, grex adeo quas muliebris amet.
His second wife was a widow, Camd. Remains, in wise speeches.
of whom he was wont to say, that she was, nec bella nec puella. Who as she was
a good huswife, so was she not void of the fault that often follows that
virtue, somewhat shrewd to her servants. Upon a time Sir Thomas found fault
with her continual chiding, saying, If that nothing would reclaim her, yet
the consideration of the time (for it was Lent) should restrain her. Tush,
tush, my Lord (said she) look here is one step to heauen-ward, showing him a
Friars girdle. I fear me, said he, this one step will not bring you up a
step higher.

One day when she came from shrift, she said merrily to her husband; Be merry,
Sir Thomas, for this day was I well shriuen, I thank God, and purpose now
therefore to leave off all my old shrewdness. Yea (quoth he) and to begin
afresh.

This man thus much given to a certain pleasure in harmless mirth, facetious
jests, and present witty answers, was wonderful zealous in Religion, and
devout: in so much that diverse times in his Chancellourship, he would put on a
Surplise, and help the Priest to say and sing divine Service; for which being
reprehended by Thomas Duke of Norfolk, who told him that it was a dishonor to
the King, that the Lord Chancellor of England should be a Parish Clerk. He
thus answered, Now truly, my Lord, I think, and verily believe, that when the
King shall hear of the care I have both to serve his Master and mine, he will
accept and take me for a faithful Servant. Which he might well say; for upon
his first coming to his service, the King gave him this godly lesson: First
look unto God, and then after unto me. Upon which religious and Princely
lesson, he grounds a reason, and pleads a liberty, to use his own proper
conscience in the Kings most weighty affairs; as you may perceive by this
part of a letter following written to Cromwell.

Ex lit. in bib. Cott.
Right worshipful, etc. it pleased the Kings highness to send me in the company
of my Lord of London, now of Duresme, in embassiate about the Peace that at
our being there was concluded at Cameray, between his highness, and the emperor,
and the French King. And after my coming home, his highness of his only goodness
(as far my unworthy I was thereto) made me (as you well know) his Chauncelor
of this Realm: sone after which time, his grace moved me again yit-eftsonys
to look and considre his great matter, and well and indifferently to pondre
such things as I should find therein. And if it so were, that thereupon it
should happen me to se such things as should persuade me to that part; he
would gladly use me among other of his Counsailors in that matter; and
nevertheless gracyousely declared unto me, that he would in no wise that I
should other thing do or say therein, than upon that that I should perceive mine
own conscience should serve me; and that I should first look unto God, and
after God unto him. Which most gratiouse wordys was the first lesson also that
ever his grace gave me at my first coming into his noble servyce. etc. This
learned Chancellor with much labor and earnest suite to the King got leave to
leave his office, before he had continued therein fully three years.

Upon his last speech to his three daughters, and to the people present at his
decollation: thus one writes. Ne lugete meo confusae funere natae: Nich.
Grudius.

Ipse ego mutari non mea fata velim.
Truncum terra teget, si Rex non abnuet vrnam;
Et mea iam terris nomina nota volant.

In partem hanc quod agat nulla securis habet.

Thus much of Sir Thomas More in this place; you may know more of him
hereafter, by his Epitaph in Chelsey Church.

Cromwell, Tho. Cromwell Earl of Essex.
surnamed the great, whom Wolsey first raised from the forge to eminent good
fortunes; whom Henry the eight used as his instrument, to suppress the Popes
supremacy, and to dissolve religious Structures; whom he advanced to the
highest pitch of honor and authority: Ex Mss. in bib. Cotton.
whom he cast down suddenly, and bereft both of life and dignity, lies here
interred.

He followed the same steps, to the same Stage, upon the said Tower Hill, and
acted there the same part, which his two friends, More, and Fisher, had done
before him: and that within five years after.

This Cromwell, this pillar of the State, was borne in Putney, a Village in
Surrey, by Thames side, four miles distant from London; he was son to a
Blacksmith, in his later days a Bruer. Whose mother, after his fathers
decease, was remarried to a Shereman. Of whose birth a late writer thus sings.

Putney the place made blessed by my birth, M. Drayton in the Legend of great
Cromwell.

Whose meanest cottage simply me did shroud,
To me as dearest of the English Earth;
So of my bringing that poor village proud,
Though in a time when never less the dearth
Of happy wits, yet mine so well allowed,
That with the best she boldly durst prefer
Me, that my breath acknowledged from her.
He was a man of an active and forward ripeness of nature, ready and pregnant
of wit, discreet, and well advised in judgment, eloquent of tongue, faithful
and diligent in service, of an incomparable memory, of a reaching politic
head, and of a noble and undaunted spirit. Whose good parts being perceived by
Cardinal Wolsey, he took him straight into his service, made him his
Solicitor, and employed him in matters of great importance: after whose fall,
he was presently advanced to the Kings service; wherein he so industriously
and wisely demeaned himself, as that he was thought worthy by the said King,
to have the ordering of all weighty affairs. Whereupon at several times, he
heaped these several offices and honors upon him; he made him Master of his
Iewell-house; Baron Cromwell of Okeham, principal Secretary, Master of the
Rolls, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Keeper of the privy Seal, Justice of
the Forests and Chases from the River of Trent Northward, great Chamberlain
of England, Earl of Essex, Knight of the Garter, Vicegerent, or Vicar
general. Of which my fore remembered friend thus writes. M. Drayton.
For first from knighthood rising in degree,
The Office of the Iewell-house my lot,
After the Rolls, he frankly gave to me,
From whence a privy Counselor I got,
Then of the Garter; and then Earl to be
Of Essex: yet sufficient these were not:
But to the great Vicegerencie I grew,
Being a title as supreme as new.
Thus Fortune raised him a short time for a sudden fall; For upon the
eighteenth day of April, 1540. he was invested with the honor of the
Earldom of Essex, and high Chamberlainship of England; upon which day the
King also made his son Gregory Lord Cromwell. Upon the ninth of July, next
and immediately following (being envied of many for his honor and authority)
he was suddenly arrested in the Councell-chamber, and committed to the Tower,
upon the nineteenth of the said month, he was attainted by Parliament, of
heresy and high Treason; and upon the 28. of the said month, he was beheaded
on the Tower Hill. More succinctly, thus, his precipitate downfall is versified.

M. Drayton.
The Councell-chamber place of my arrest,
Where chief I was, when greatest was the store:
And had my speeches noted of the best,
That did them as high Oracles adore.
A Parliament was lastly my Enquest,
That was my self a Parliament before.
The Tower hill Scaffold, last I did ascend,
Thus the great'st man of England made his end.
And such bloody ends most men have, who are busy managers of the greatest
matters.

He was condemned to death, Some say, no such Act was devised by him to cause
his own death. Speed. chap. 21.
and yet never came to his answer, by an act (as it is said) which he himself
caused to be made; of which my foreremembred Author M. Drayton.

Those laws I made my self alone to please,
To give me power more freely to my will,
Even to my equals hurtful sundry ways,
(Forced to things that most do say were ill)
Upon me now as violently seize,
By which I lastly perish by my skill,
On mine own neck returning (as my due)
That heavy yoke wherein by me they drew.
Thus whilst we strive, too suddenly to rise,
By flattering Princes with a servile tongue;
And being soothers to their tirannies,
Work our much woes, by what does many wrong.
And unto others tending injuries,
Unto our selves it happening often among.
In our own snares unluckily are caught,
Whilst our attempts fall instantly to naught.
Many lamented this great man's fall, but more reioiced, especially such as had
been religious men, or favored religious persons; of the Clergy he was much
hated, for that he was an enemy to Popery, and could never endure the snuffing
pride of the Prelates. Thankful he was, and liberal, never forgetting
former benefits, as appears by his requital of the kindness he had received
from Friscolald the Italian Merchant; John Fox. M. Drayton.
careful he was of his servants, for whom he had provided a competencie of
living, notwithstanding his sudden fall: faithful and forward he was to do
his friends good, and amongst them More and Fisher, if we may believe their
own letters, of which some part.

Right worshipful, Sir Tho. Moore, to Master Cromwell, Ex lit. in bib. Cot*
after my most hearty commendations, it may please you to understand that I
have perceived by the relation of my Son Rooper, (for which I beseech
almighty God reward you) your most cheritable labor taken for me toward the
Kings graciouse highness, in the procuring at his most graciouse hand, the
relief and comfort of this woeful heuinesse, in which mine heart stands, etc.
concluding in these words.

And thus good Master Cromwell, I make an end of my long troublouse process,
beseching the blessed Trinity, for the great goodness ye show me, and the
great cumfort ye do me both bodelie and ghostly to prospere you, and in heaven
to reward you.

At Chelcith the v. day of March, by Your deeply bounden, Tho. More, Knight.


Bishop Fisher acknowledges the like kindness from him in many of his
letters: And howsoever these two famous scholars, after some hard
imprisonment, lost both their lives; yet was he not wanting by his best
endeavors, and his all-potencie with the King, to have saved their necks from
the stroke of the Axe, which we may verily believe, when we consider that King
Henry's command was a Law; of which Cromwell had a trial, being convicted and
executed without trial.

years after his first coming into the favor and service of the said King,

Besides these, he did many other services for the King his master; but I will
insist only upon two, by which he greatly enriched his Coffers.

The one was upon the Coronation of Queen Anne Bullen, against which
solemnity, the King sent writings to all Sheriffs, to certify the names of
men of forty pounds lands, to receive the order of Knighthood, or else to make
fine for the same. The asseasement of which (says my Author) was appointed to
Thomas Cromwell then master of the Kings Iewell-house, who so used the matter,
that a great sum of money was levied to the Kings use by those fines.

The other was his pains and policy in the suppressing of Religious
Foundations.

This great man gave great relief to the poor; Stow. Annal.
two hundred poor people were served at his gates twice every day; with bread,
meat, and drink sufficient.

He had 220. men and above in check roll; he gave liueries guarded with velvet
to his Getlemen; and guarded with the same cloth to his Yeomen, says John Stow
in the Suruay of London, in the chapter of orders and customs.

Queen Anne Bullein.
Within the Quire of this Chapel, lies buried the body of Anne Bollein,
Marchioness of Penbroke, eldest daughter and coheire of Thomas Bollein,
Viscount Rochford, Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond, second wife to King Henry the
eight, to whom she bare into the world, that most renowned Princess,
Elizabeth, our late Queen, who proved not only the mirror of the world, for
virtue, wisdom, piety, and justice, but also a pattern for government to all
the Princes in christendom. Speed cap. 21.
Another manchilde she bore also unto the said King, though without life, upon
the 29. day of January, and the 27. year of his reign, to the no little
grief of his mother, some dislike of the King, as the sequel of her
accusation and death did shortly confirm: for upon the 19. day of May next
following, upon the green within the Tower, her head was cut off by the sword,
and by the hands of the Hangman of Caleis; when she had been King Henry's
wife three years, three months, and twenty five days.

The blood was scarce wipt off the blade, nor she (...) in her grave, (an
argument that her life was sought after upon fal^e (...)) before another Lady
was possessed of her bed; for, on the (...) her beheading, the King her husband
was married to that (...) Princess Jane, the the daughter of John Seymor
Knight, and sister to Lord Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, and Duke of
Somerset.

Here lies buried in the said Chapel, the body of George Bollein, Lord
Rochford, George Bullein, Lord Rochford.
brother to the beheaded Queen, who (together with Henry Norrice, Mark
Smeton, William Brereton, and Francis Weston, all of the Kings privy Chamber)
was beheaded on the Tower h^ll, two days before the death of his Sister, about
matters concerning the said Queen: none of them all confessing the act
whereupon they suffered death; only Smeton, contrary to his conscience (says
one) confessed some thing, Speed cap. 21.
in hope of life and preferment, which condemned both himself and the rest, of
which, Sleidan. com. l. 10.
thus Cromwell writ to the King. Many things have been objected, but nothing
confessed, only some circumstances have been acknowledged by Mark Smeton.
This he writ after the prisoners had been thoroughly examined in the Tower.

This Smeton, Brierton, Norrice, and Weston, lie buried here in the
Chappell-yard.

Queen Katherine Howard.
Here, and near to the relics of the said Anne Bollein, lies interred the
body of Katherine, the fifth wife of King Henry the eight, the daughter of
Edmond, and Niece unto Thomas Howard his brother, Duke of Norfolk; who having
continued his wife but the space of one year, six months, and four days,
was attainted by Parliament, and beheaded here in the Tower, upon the 13. of
February, 1541.

It is verily believed, and many strong reasons are given, both by English and
foreign writers, to confirm that belief; that neither this Queen Katherine,
nor Queen Anne, were any way guilty of the breach of matrimony, whereof they
were accused; but that King Henry, unconstant and variable in his affections,
and as unstayed in religious resolutions, did cut them off upon false
suggestions, soon weary of the old, and ever aiming at new Espousals.

Between these two Queens, Ed. and John Dukes of Somerset and Northumberland
before the high Altar, lie buried two Dukes, to wit, the Duke of Somerset,
Edward Seymour, and the Duke of Northumberland, John Dudley. Of whom hereafter.

Here lies Henry Southworth, Hen. Southworth.
borne at Halton Castle, in the Parish of Runkorne in Cheshire, Yeoman of the
Crown, and of the Guard, to king Henry the seventh, and Henry the eight,

years. Who died.......

Here lies Gefferay Hewyt, Geff. Hewet and Ioane his wife.
and Ione his wife, one of the Gonners in the Tower.... Ione died... 1525.

There are some other Inscriptions in this Chapel, but they are of late times.

Burials of the dead in the fields, near to the City of London.
These burials in the fields might better have been spoken of, in my prefixed
discourse, where I write of the strange custom of interring, and preserving of
the bodies of the dead. But being forgotten there, it will not be amiss (I
hope) that they may be remembered here.

In the fields on the North-East and East side of the suburbs, In Mi^lesex.
whiles I was writing these matters (says Camden) there were gotten out of the
ground many vrnes, funeral vessels, little Images, and earthen pots, wherein
were small pieces of money coined by Claudius, Nero, Vespasian, etc. Glass
vials also, and sundry small earthen vessels, wherein some liquid substance
remained, which I would think to be either of that sacred oblation of wine and
milk, which the ancient Romans used when they burnt the dead, or else those
odoriferous liquors that Statius mentions.

Pharijque liquores
Arsuram lavere Comam.
And liquid baulmes from Egypt-land that came
Did wash his hair that ready was for flame.
This place the Romans appointed to burn and bury dead bodies, who according
to the law of the twelve tables carried coarses out of their Cities, and
interred them by the highways side, to put passengers in mind that they are,
as those were, subject to mortality.

Stow speaks more fully of these, Suruay in Bishopsgateward.
and other kinds of funeral Monuments, found here in the fields.

About the year 1576. says he, Lolesworth-field, now called Spittlefield,
was broken up for clay to make Brick. In the digging whereof, many earthen
pots, called Vrnae, were found full of Ashes, and burnt bones of men, to wit,
of the Romans, that inhabited here. For it was the custom of the Romans, to
burn their dead, to put their Ashes in an Vrne, and then bury the same with
certain ceremonies, in some field appointed for that purpose, near unto their
City.

Every of these pots had in them (with the ashes of the dead) one piece of
Copper-money, with the inscription of the Emperor then reigning; some of them
were of Claudius, some of Vespasian, some of Nero, some of Antonius Pius, of
Traiane, and others. Besides those vrnes, many other pots were found in the
same place, made of a white earth, with long necks and handles, like to our
stone Iugs: these were empty, but seemed to be buried full of some liquid
matter, long since consumed and soaked through. For there were found diverse
vials, and other fashioned Glasses, some most cunningly wrought, such as I have
not seen the like, and some of Crystal, all which had water in them, nothing
differing in clearness, taste, or savor, from common spring water, whatsoever
it was at the first. Some of these Glasses had oil in them very thick, and
earthy in savor. Some were supposed to have Balm in them, but had lost the
virtue: Many of these pots and Glasses were broken in cutting of the clay, so
that few were taken up whole.

There were also found diverse Dishes and Cups, of a fine re^de colored earth,
which showed outwardly such a shining smoothness, as if they had been of
currall. Those had (in the bottomes) Roman letters printed; There were also
Lamps of white earth and red, artificially wrought with diverse Antiques; about
them, some three or four Images, made of white earth, about a spanne long each
of them. One, I remember, was of Pallas, the rest I have forgotten. I my self
have reserved (amongst diverse of those Antiquities there) one vrne, with the
ashes and bones, and one pot of white earth very small, not exceeding the
quantity of a wine pint, made in shape of a Hare squatted upon her legs, and
between her ears is the mouth of the pot.

There has also been found (in the same field) diverse coffins of stone,
containing the bones of men: these I suppose to be the burials of some special
persons, in time of the Britains, or Saxons. Moreover, there were also found
the sculls and bones of men without coffins, or rather whose coffines (being of
great timber) were consumed. Diverse great Nails of Iron were there found, such
as are used in the wheels of shod carts, being each of them as big as a man's
finger, and a quarter of a yard, the heads two inches over. Those Nails were
more wondered at then the rest of the things there found; and many opinions of
men were there uttered of them; namely that the men there buried, were
murdered by driving those Nails into their heads, a thing unlikely: for a
smaller Nail would more aptly serve to so bad a purpose; and a more secret
place would lightly be employed for such burial.

But to set down what I observed concerning this matter, I there beheld the
bones of a man lying (as I noted) the head North, the feet South, and round
about him (as thwart his head, along both his sides, and thwart his feet) such
Nails were found. Wherefore I coniectured them to be Nails of his coffin.
Which had been a trough, cut out of some great tree, and the same covered with
a planke of a great thickness, fastened with such Nails, and therefore I
caused some of the Nails to be reached up to (...) found under the broad heads
of them, the old wood, ^eane turned into earth* but still retaining both the
grain and proper color. Of these Nails (with the wood under the head
thereof) I reserved one, as also the (...)-bone of the man, the teeth being
great, sound, and fixed, which (amongst many other Monuments there found) I
have yet to show: but the nail lying dry, is by scaling greatly wasted. And
thus much of ancient Funeral Monuments in the fields.

Certain Burials of British Kings in and about London, the places of their
interments uncertain.
And first to begin with Guentoline, ^
the son of Gurgunstus, King of Britain, who flourished about the year of
the world, 3614. Who was a wise Prince, grave in counsel, and sober in
behavior, and studied, with great care and diligence, to reform anew, and to
adorn with justice, laws, and good orders, the British commonwealth; by other
Kings not so framed as stood with the greatness thereof. But as he was busy
in hand herewith, death took him away from these worldly employments, when he
had reigned 27. years.

He had a wife named Martia Proba, a woman of perfect beauty, and wisdom
incomparable, as by her prudent government, and equal administration of
justice, after her husbands decease, during her sons minority, it most
manifestly appeared.

She was a woman expert and skillful in diverse sciences, but chiefly, being
admitted to the government of the Realm, she studied to preserve the common
wealth in good, quiet, and decent order; and therefore devised, established,
and writ a book in the British tongue of profitable and convenient Laws, the
which after her name were called Martian Laws. These Laws afterward Gildas
Cambrius, the Historical Welsh Poet, translated into Latin: and a long time
after him, Alured, King of the West Saxons, holding these laws necessary for
the preservation of the common wealth, put them into English Saxon speech, and
then they were called after that translation, Marchenclagh, that is to mean,
the Laws of Martia; adding thereunto a Book of his own writing of the Laws
of England, which he called, A certain Breuiarie extracted out of diverse Laws
of the Trojans, Grecians, Britains, Saxons, and Danes. She flourished before
the birth of our Lord and Savior, 348. years, or thereabouts.

Her sons name was Sicilius, Sicilius king of Britain.
who upon the death of his Father was but young: for I read that Martia his
mother, delivered up the government of the kingdom to her son when he came
to lawful age, which she had right politiquely guided, and highly for her
perpetual renown and commendation, the space of fourteen years. He died
when he had reigned seven years, some say fifteen years.

Of Bladud, king of Britain, the son of Lud hurdibras, many incredible
passages are delivered by our old British writers, and followed by sundry
Authors of succeeding ages, which say, that he was so well seen in the
Sciences of Astronomy and Necromancie, that thereby he made the hot springs
in the City of Bathe: that he built the City of Bathe: that he went to Athens
and brought with him four Philosophers, and by them instituted an University
at Stanford in Lincolnshire. And further to show his Art and cunning, that he
took upon him to fly into the air; and that he broke his neck by a fall
from the Temple of Apollo in Troynouant, before the incarnation of Christ 852.
years, in the twentieth year of his reign. Geffrey of Monmouth, and Matthew
of Westminster would approve as much as here is spoken of him; Song 3.
And learned Seldom in his Illustrations upon Draytons Polyolbion, sets down
an ancient fragment of rimes, wherein these strange things of him are expressed.

But of him here in this place, will it please you take a piece out of Harding,
and you shall have more hereafter.

Vo^t^mer king of Britain.
Likewise the uncertain burial of Vortimer, that victorious British king, was
in some part of this City; he was the eldest son of Vortigern king of the
Britains, and reigned as king in his fathers days; who demeaned himself
toward his son, then his Sovereign, in all dutiful obedience and faithful
counsel; for the space of four years, even until Vortimer was poisoned by
the subtlety of Rowena the heathen, daughter of Hengist the Saxon, the wife or
concubine of his Brother, and the mother of the Britains mischief, which
happened about the year of Grace 464.

Speed. Hist. cap. 12.
This Vortimer was a man of great valor, which altogether he employed for the
redress of his country, according to the testimony of William Malmesbury,
whose words are these.

Vortimer (says he) thinking not good to dissemble the matter, for that he saw
himself and country daily surprised by the craft of the Saxons, set his full
purpose to drive them out, and from the seventh year after their first
entrance, for twenty years continuance, fought many battles with them, and
four of them with great puissance in the open field; in the first whereof,
they departed with like fortune, and loss of the Generals brethren Horsa and
Latigern: in the other three, the Britains went away with victory, and so
long, until Vortimer was taken away by fatal death.

It is recorded of him, Sigibert.
that after he had vanquished the Saxons, and dispossessed them of all their
footing in the Continent, yea, and often assailed them in the Isle of Tannet:
the Church of Christianity being ruinated by the Pagan marriage of Rowena with
his Brother, as aforesaid, that he restored the Christian Religion, as then
sorely decayed, and new built the Churches that his enemies, the misbeleeuing
Saxons had destroyed.

It is also reported by Nennius of Bangor, in the history of his country,
that after his last victory over the Saxons, he caused his monument to be
erected at the entrance into Tanet, and in the same place of that great
overthrow, which by the said Author, is called Lapis Tituli, of us the Stonar;
where for certain, it seems, has been an haven. In this monument, he
commanded his body to be buried, to the further terror of the Saxons, that in
beholding this his Trophie, their spirits might be daunted at the remembrance
of their great overthrow. As Scipio Africanus conceited the like, who commanded
his Sepulcher to be so set, that it might ouerlooke Africa, supposing that his
very Tomb would be a terror to the Carthaginians. But how that desire of
Vortimer was performed, I Speed Hist. ca. xi.
I find not, says a late writer: but rather the contrary; for an old
Manuscript I have, that confidently affirms him to be buried in London, which
agrees with these old Rimes of my reverend Monk of Gloucester. Rob Glocest.

The uncertain burial of Edward and Richard, the sons of King Edward the
fourth.
Edward, the eldest son of King Edward the fourth, by Queen Elizabeth his
wife, say our English Writers, was borne in the Sanctuary at Westminster,
Videsis Speed. Hist. ca. 17. and Vincent Catal. Chest^r.
the fourth of November, and year of grace, 1470. being the tenth of his
fathers reign, at that time expulsed the Realm by the powerful Earl of
Warwick; but fortune being changed, and the father restored, the son in July
following, the six and twentieth day, 1471. was created Prince of Wales, and
Earl of Chester; and afterward upon the eight of July, in the 19 year of his
said fathers reign, he was by Letters Patents, dated at Esthamsted, further
honored with the Earledomes of Penbroke and March. He was proclaimed King, but
never crowned, yet had not the ambitious hand of his Uncle been defiled in his
innocent blood, he might have worn the Diadem many years, whereas he bare
the title of King no longer then two months and eighteen days.

Richard, surnamed of Shrewsbury, because he was there borne, the second son
of Edward the fourth, by his wife Elizabeth, as aforesaid, was affianced in his
infancy, to Anne the only daughter and heir of John Lord Mowbray Duke of
Norfolk; he was honored by the titles of Duke of Norfolk, Earl Warren,
Earl Marshall, and Nottingham; also Lord Baron of Mowbray, Segraue, and of
Gower, as Milles will have it; Mill. Catal. York.
but inioying neither wife, title, or his own life long, was with his brother,
murdered in the Tower of London, and in the prison of that Tower, which, upon
that most sinful deed, is ever since called the bloody Tower, their bodies as
yet unknown where to have burial. The story of whose death, and supposed
interment, extracted out of authentical Authors, is thus delivered by John
Speed.

Speed Hist. ^ ^^
Prince Edward and his brother (says he) were both shut up in the Tower, and
all attendants removed from them, only one called Blacke-Will, or William
Slaughter excepted, who was set to serve them, and to see them sure. After
which time the Prince never tied his points, nor cared for himself, but with
that young Babe his brother, lingered with thought and heaviness, till their
traitorous deaths delivered them out of that wretchedness: for the execution
whereof, Sir James Tirrill appointed Miles Forest, a fellow fleshed in murder
before time: to whom he joined one John Dighton his horse-keeper, a big,
broad, square knave.

About midnight (all others being removed from them) this Miles Forest, and
John Dighton, came into the Chamber, and suddenly wrapped up the sely children
in the Bed-clothes where they lay, keeping, by force, the featherbed and
pillowes hard upon their mouths, that they were therein smothered to death,
and gave up to God their innocent souls, into the joys of heaven, leaving
their bodies unto the Tormentors, dead in the bed* which after these monstrous
wretches perceived, first by the struggling with the pains of death, and after
long lying still to be thoroughly dispatched, they laid their bodies naked out
upon the bed, and then fetched Sir James Tirrill their instigator, to see them,
who caused these murderers to bury them at the stairs foot, somewhat deep in
the ground, under a great heap of stones. Then ro^e Sir James in haste to the
King, unto whom he showed the manner of their death, and place of burial;
which news was so welcome to his wicked heart, as he greatly rejoiced, and
with great thanks dubbed (as some hold) this his merciless Instrument,
Knight. But the place of their burial he liked not, saying, that vile corner
should not contain the bodies of those Princes, his Nephews, and commanded
them a better place for burial, because they were the Sons of a King.
Whereupon the Priest of the Tower took up their bodies, and secretly interred
them in such a place, which by the occasion of his death, could never since
come to light.

The continuer of John Harding tells us from the report of others, that King
Richard caused Sir Robert Brakenburies Priest to close their dead corpse in
lead, and so to put them in a coffin full of holes, and hooked at the ends with
two hooks of iron, and so to cast them into a place called the Black deepes
at the Thames mouth, whereby they should never rise up, or be any more seen.

To which effect I have seen their Epitaph written by Thomas Stanley, Bishop
of Man, Parson of Winwicke, and Wigan in Lancashire, who ^lourished in the
several reigns of King Henry the eight, Edward the sixth, Queen Mary, and
Queen Elizabeth* thus it runs in his Lancashire rimes.

In Londons Toure in one plase or anoder
Interryd lay King Edward and his Brother,
Who by there wicked Uncle.
Eme were guyltles sleyne,
And basely beryd, yet took up again
And cast into the black deepes at Tems mouth.
Now whether wreckt, or tossed from North to South,
Their relics are, it recks not; there souls rest
In Heu'n amangst Gods children ever blessed.
They weren murdered in July, 1483. Edward being thirteen years old, and
Richard about some two years younger.

The just judgment of God severely revenged the murder of these innocent
Princes upon the malefactors. For first to begin with the Ministers; Miles
Forest at Saint Martins, peece-meale rotted away; Sir James Tirril^ died at
Tower hill for treason committed against Henry the seventh; Dighton indeed
(says my Author, The Continuer of Hardings Chronicle.
who lived in those times) walks on alive, in good possibility to be hanged
ere he die, living at Calleis, no less distained and hated, then pointed at of
all. King Richard himself was slain in the field, hacked and hewed of his
enemies hands, harried on a horse back naked, being dead, his hair in despite
torn and tugged like a curre dog. And the mischief that he took, was
within less then three years of the mischief that he did, and yet all the
mean time spent in much pain and trouble outward, and much fear, anguish,
and sorrow within. For I have heard by credible report of his Chamberlain, The
guilty conscience of King Richard
that after this abominable deed done, he never was quiet in his mind: he
never thought himself sure, for where he went abroad, his eyes ever whirled
about, his body was privily fenced, his hand was ever on his dagger, his
countenance and manner was like one ever ready to strike again; he took ill
rest a nights, lay long waking and musing, sore wearied with care and watch,
rather slumbred, then slept, troubled with fearful dreams, suddenly some
times start up, leapt out of his bed, and ran about the chambers; so was his
restless heart continually tossed and tumbled, with the tedious impression and
stormy remembrance of his execrable murders.

Persius makes an imprecation to Jupiter, that he would punish Kings,
committing such horride actions, with this horror of conscience, thus.

Pers. Sat. 3. trans. by ^erten Holyday.
Great Father of the gods: when cruel lust,
Touched with inflaming venom, moves the unjust
Corrupted disposition of fierce Kings,
To act unworthy and unkingly things:
Punish them only thus. Let them but see
Fair virtue, and their lost felicity.
Then shall their bowels yearne, and they shall cry
In secret, and wax pale, and pine, and die.
But here enough of King Richard, until I come to Leicester, and there to the
place of his burial.

Sir Thomas Moore Lord Chancellor.
On the south side of the Quire of this Church, under a plain Monument, lies
the body of Sir Thomas More, Lord Chancellor of England, beheaded on the Tower
hill, for denying of the Kings Supremacy, the sixth of July, 1535. Over his
Tomb is an Inscription upon the wall, made by himself, a little after he gave
over his Office of being Chancelour, now hardly to be read.

Sir Thomas More, having removed the body of his first wife Ioane to this place
intended for his own burial, composed this Epitaph to her memory; which I
have read.

Clara Thome iacet hic Ioanna vxorcula Mori, Joan and Alice the wives of Sir
Tho. More. in bib. Cot.

Qui tumulum Alicie hunc destino quoque tibi.
Vna mihi dedit hoc coniuncta virentibus unnis
Me vocet vt puer, and trina puella Patrem.
Altera priuignis (que gloria rara Nouerce est)
Tam pia quam gnatis vix fuit vlla suis.
Altera sic mecum vixit, sic altera viuit,
Charior incertum est, hec sit an hec fuerit.
O simul, O iuncti poteramus viuere nos tros
Quam been si factum Religioque sinant.
Et societ tumulus, societ nos obsecro celum,
Sic mors non potuit quod dare vita dabit.
The Character of this ingenious and learned Lord Chancellor is delivered at
large by all our late English Historiographers, as also by many foreign
writers. To whom, and to that which I have spoken of him before, I refer my
Reader.

The office of Remembrancers. D. Cowell. lic. R.
Of the Office of Remembrancers, whereof William the father of this Thomas Essex
here entombed, was one and the chief: give me leave to speak a little out of
the Interpreter.

Remembrancers of the Exchequer (Rememoratores) be three Officers or Clerks.
One called the Kings Remembrancer, Ann. 35. Eli. cap. 5. The other the Lord
Treasurers Remembrancer. Upon whose charge it seems to lie, that they put all
Justices of that Court, as the Lord Treasurer, and the rest, in remembrance of
such things as are to be called on, and dealt in for the Princes behoof. The
third is called the Remembrancer of the first fruits. Of these you may read
something, Ann. 5. Ric. 2. Stat. 1. cap. 14. and 15. to the effect above
specified. These An 37. Ed. 3. cap. 4. be called Clerks of the Remembrance. It
seems that the name of the Officer is borrowed from the Civilians, who have
their Memoriales, qui sunt notarij Cancellariae in regno subiecti officio
Quaestoris. Lucas de Penna. C. lib. 10 tit. 12. number. 7. The Kings Remembrancer.
The Kings Remembrancer enters into his Office all Recognisances, taken before
the Barons for any the Kings debts, for apparences, or for observing of orders.
He takes all bonds for any of the Kings debts, or for appearance, or for
observing of orders, and makes process upon them for the breach of them. He
writes process against the Collectours of Customs, Subsedies, and Fiueteenths
for their accounts. All informations upon penal Statutes are entered in his
Office. And all matters upon English Bills in the Exchequer Chamber are
remaining in his Office. He makes the Bills of compositions upon penal
Laws, takes the stalments debts, makes a Record of a Certificate delivered
to him by the Clerks of the Star Chamber of the Fines there set, and sends
them to the Pipe. He has delivered to his Office all manner of Indentures,
fines, and other Evidences whatsoever, that concern the assuring of any lands
to the Crown. He yearly, in Crastino Animarum, reads in open Court the
Statute for election of Sheriffs, and gives those that choose them their
oath. He reads in open Court the oath of all the Officers of the Court, when
they are admitted.

The Treasurers Remembrancer makes Process against all Sheriffs, The
Treasurers Remembrancer.
Escheators, Receivers, and Bayliffes, for their accounts. He makes Process of
Fieri Facias, and extent for any debts due to the King, either in the Pipe, or
with the Auditors. He makes Process for all such revenue as is due to the King
by reason of his tenures. He makes a Record, whereby it appears whether
Sheriffs and other accountants keep their days of prefixion. All extreats of
fines, issues, and amerciaments set in any Courts of Westminster, or at the
Assizes, or Sessions, are certified into his Office; and are by him delivered
to the Clerk of Extreats to write Process upon them. He has also brought into
his Office all the accounts of Customers, Controullers, and other accomptants,
to make thereof an entry of Record.

The Remembrancer of the first fruits takes all Compositions for first fruits
and Tenths; Remembrancer of the first fruits.
and makes Process against such as pay not the same.

Now to return; these Essexes were Lords of this Town (as I have it by
relation) which Town, at this day, is much honored by the Lord thereof, that
noble Gentleman, Sir Henry Rich, Captain of his Majesty's Gaurd, and knight of
the Garter, Baron Kensington of Kensington, Earl of Holland, and one of his
Majesty's most honorable privy Counsel.

Lora is a name derived from the Saxon word Lore, which signifies learning or
understanding. A word often used by Chaucer in that sense to express learning.
As in the Squiers Prologue: I see well that ye learned men in lore
Can muckle good.
Or as Camden does conjecture, a name corrupted from Laura, which is Bay, and
is agreeable to the Greek name Daphne.

The Monastery of Sion.
So named of the most holy Mount Sion, The foundation of Sion.
which King Henry the fifth, when he had expelled thence the Monks Aliens,
built for religious Virgins, to the honor of our Savior, the Virgin Mary, and
Saint Bridget of Sion: Nuns and Priests Augustines.
In which house he appointed to the glory of God, so many Nuns, Priests, and
lay Brethren, as were in number equal to Christ his Apostles and Disciples;
namely of Virgins sixty, Priests thirteen, Deanes four, and lay Brethren
eight. These two Couents had but one Church in common, the Nuns had their
Church aloft in the roof, and the brethren beneath upon the ground; each
Covent severally enclosed, and never allowed to come out, except by the Popes
special license. Upon whom when this godly and glorious King had bestowed
sufficient living (taken from the Priories Aliens, all which he utterly
suppressed) he provided by a law, that contenting themselves therewith, they
should take no more of any man, but what overplus soever remained of their
yearly revenue, they should bestow it upon the poor. Their commings in were
valued at the suppression, to be worth 1944 l. 11 s. 8 d. q. by year.

A Lettore certefyinge the incontynensye of the Nuns of Syon with the
Friores, and aftere the act done, the Friores reconsile them to God.
Endorsed. To the right honorable, Master Thomas Cromwell, chief Secretary to
the Kings highness.
It may plese your goodness to understand that Bushope this day preched and
declared the Kings tytelle very well, Ex lit. in Bib. S. Dewes.
and hade a great Audyense, the Chorche full of people, one of the Focaces in
his said declaration, openly called him false knave, with other foolish words,
it was that foolish fellow with the corled head that kneeled in your way when
you came forth of the Confessores Chamber. I can noe lose do, but set him in
prisone, vt pena eius sit metus alioram: yesterday I learned many enormeous
things against Bushope, in the examinacion of the lay Brederen; first that
Bushop persuaded towe of the Brederene to have gone their ways by night, and
he himself with them, and to the accomplishment of that, they lacked but money
to buy them seculere apparel: Forther, that Bushope would have persuaded one
of his lay Brederen a Smithe, to have made a keaye for the doare, to have in
the night time received in Wenches for him and his fellows, and specially a
wyffe of Vxebridge, now dwelling not far from the old Lady Derby, nigh
Vxbridge: which wyffe his old customer has byne many times here at the grates
communyng with the said, and ^e was desirous to have her conuoyed in to him.
The said Bushope also persuaded a Nun, to whom he was Confessor, Ad libidinem
corporis perimplend. And thus he persuaded her in Confession, making her
believe, that whenever, and as often as they should meddle together, if she
were, i^mediately after, confessed by him, and took of him absolution, she
should be clear forgeuen of God, and it should be none offense unto her before
God. And she writ diueres and sundry lettores unto him of such their
foolishness and vnthri^tynesse, and would have had his Brother the Smith to have
polled out a bar of iron of that window, whereas ye examyned the Lady Abbas,
that he might have gone in to her by night. And that same window was their
commoning place by night. He persuaded the Sextene that he would be in his
contemplacion in the Chorche by night, and by that means was many nights in
the Chorche talkyng with her at the said grate of the Nuns Quire, and there
was there meeting place by night, besides their day communications, as in
confession: it were too long to declare all things of him that I have hard,
which I suppos is true. This afternoon I intend to make forder search, both of
some of the Brederen, and some also of the Sisters for such like matteres; if I
find any thing apparent to be true, I shall God willing thereof sertefy your
Mastorshipe to morrow, by vii in the morning. And aftor this day I suppos
there will be no other things to be known as yet here; for I have already
examined all the Brederen, and many of them would gladly depart hense, and be
right weary of their habbyte: such Religion and fained sancterye, God save me
froe. If Master Bedle had byne here a Frior, and of Bushopes Counsel, he would
right well have helped him to have broghte his mattores to pass* without
brekyng up of any grate or yet counterfettyng of keayes, such capassetye God
has sent him.

From Syone this sunday xii. Decembere. By the speedy hand of your assured
poor Preeste, Richard Layton.

If the date of this Inscription were true, this Archer did line in the reign

Hownslow Chapel.
Which belonged sometime to a Frierie thereunto adjoining, The Friery of
Hounslow*
now a Chapel of ease for the Inhabitants, which are of two parishes, Heston,
and Thistleworth: by whom this fraternity was founded, I cannot learn, except
by the Windsores, a family of many descents, ever since the coming in of the
Norman Conqueror, who had their habitation at Stanwell, not far off; and
chose this Friars Chapel for their place of burial; which, together with the
house, was, after the dissolution, given by exchange, to the Lord Windsore, by
King Henry the eight.

In this Church lies buried under a Tomb, covered with a marble stone, John
Lord Strange of Knocking, upon which this Inscription is engraven.

Camd. in Shrop.
This race of le Strange, continued for many descents in the dignity of Lord
Barons, in latin Records, called Extranei, for that they were Strangers,
brought hither by King Henry the second, the year 1148. This John Lord
Strange, here intombed, was the laft of that Surname, Baron of Knocking: for
Sir George Stanley, son and heir of Thomas, Lord Stanley, Earl of Darby,
the first of that name, married Ioane, the sole daughter and heir of the
aforesaid John Lord Strange, here mentioned, who to her fathers memory, made
this monument, with whom he had both her fathers honors, and ample
inheritance; of which, Thomas Stanley* sometime Lord Bishop of Man, in his
pedigree of the Stanleyes, speaking of Thomas, the first Earl, thus makes his
rhyme, a Mss.

George Lord Strange.
He married his first son George, to no Ferme, nor Grange,
But honorably to the heir of the Lord Strange:
Who lived in such love, as no man else had:
For at the death of him, diuars went almost madd;
At an ungodly banquet (alas) he was poisoned,
And at London in Saint James Garlikhith lies buried.
The style, title, and dignity of Lord Strange, James Lord Strange.
James Stanley, eldest son and heir of William Earl of Darbie (a gentleman
of laudable endowments both of mind and body) now at this day happily
enjoys.

Pray for the soul of Sir Thomas Cornwall, Sir Thomas Cornwall.
Baron of Burford in the County of Salop knight, and Ba^neret, which took to
wife Anne, the dawghter of Sir Richard Corbet of the same County; who departed
this life the xix of August, M.D.xxx.vii. on whose soul, etc.

Learned Camden, Camden in Shropshire.
speaking of the Ancestors of this active strong family of the Cornwailes, has
these words. Upon the river Temd (says he) is seen Burford, which from
Theodoricke Say and his posterity, came unto Robert Mortimer, and from his
posterity likewise, unto Sir Geffrey Cornwaile, who derived his descent from
Richard Earl of Cornwall, and king of the Almaines: and his race even to these
days has flourished under the name of Barons of Burford, but not in the
dignity of Parliamentarie Barons; whereas it is holden of the King, for to
find five men for the Army of Wales, and by service of a Baronie. But more of
these Cornwalls when I come to the usual place of their burial: for this
Gentleman was casually here interred, dying here in this Town, as he passed
from London into his own country.

And now I have peyd the stipend of this lyff,
Yeldyng my flesh to worms without any stryff.
For my soul intercede that glory it may opteyne,
Where with the blessed Trinity eternally it may reyne.
And for you ageyn prey by whose cherite I am relevyd
To sweet Jesus with whose blood I am redemyd.

Io. Brent.
Hic iacet Johannes de Brent Armiger.... obiit.... An. Dom. 1467.

These Brents were Gentlemen of ample possessions in this tract, whose chief
residence was in Brentstreet, Specul. Brit.
hereunto adjoining; from whom (says Norden) that street took her
denomination: As also the little Brook of Brent, which gives name to
Brentford, now called Brainford.

Fowke de Brent.
The most remarkable man of this Surname, was one Falcatius, or Falke, de Brent,
who for his matchless prowess, and all-daring forwardness, was so beloved of
king John, that he gave him in marriage Margaret, the daughter of Warrin
Fitzgerald his Chamberlain, late the wife of Baldwin de Rivers, son of
William Earl of Deuon and Exceter. A match thought far unfit for such a man;
but the King would have it so. Whereupon this was written.

Mat Westminst.
Lex connectit cos, amor and concordia lecti,
Sed Lex qualis? amor qualis? concordia qualis?
Lex exlex, amor exosus, concordia discors.
This Fowke lived in the like grace and favor, with king Hen. the third, for
by his fiery valor the said king got the victory at Lincoln, against Lewis
the son of the second Philip king of France, and his own rebellious Barons.
But not long after, looking over much upon the height of his Fortunes, and
remembering too often his former good Services to the State, he (presuming upon
his Sovereigns lenity) committed many horrible outrages, for which (after
pardon of his life hardly obtained) he was adjudged to perpetual banishment,
Mat. Pari^.
in which he ended his days at Rome in extreme misery, and was there buried
most ignobly, Ann. 1226.

Here lies interred under a seemly Tomb without Inscription the body of
Peter Fabell (as the report goes) upon whom this fable was fathered, that he by
his witty devises beguiled the devil: belike he was some ingenious conceited
gentleman, who did use some sleightie tricks for his own disports. He lived
and died in the reign of Henry the seventh, says the book of his merry
pranks.

This Tomb, as most of the Monuments in this Church, is shamefully defaced:

Founders of Guild Hall Chapel or College to the said Hall adjoining.

I shall have occasion hereafter to speak more fully of this thrice-noble
family of the Percies, when I come to the Abbey of Whitby in Yorkshire, of
which they were founders: for this time I will conclude with these words out of
Camden, Camd. in Surfex.
concerning these high-borne Earls of Northumberland. A family (says he) I
assure you very ancient, and right noble, which deriueth their pedigree from
Charles the great, more directly, and with a race of Ancestors less
interrupted, then either the Duke of Loraine or of Guise, that so highly vaunt
themselves thereupon.

It appears by this Epitaph, (for I find no further of him in any other

Judges, Sergeants, and many other eminent officers to the law, werefound guilty

Fylycer or Filazer, Cowell. lit. F.

pleas, whereof there be fourteen in number. They make all original Process,
as well real as personal and mixed: and in actions merely personal, where
the defendants be returned or summoned, there goes out the distress infinite,
until appearance; if he be returned nihil, then Process of Capias infinite,
if the plaintiff will, or after the third Capias, the Plaintiff may go to
the Exigenter of the Shire, where his original is grounded, and have an
Exigent, and Proclamation made. And also the Filazer makes forth all writs in
view in causes where the view is placed. He is also allowed to enter the
Imparlance, or the general issue in common actions, where appearance is made
with him, and also judgment by confession in any of them before issue be
joined: and to make out writs of Execution thereupon. But although they entered
the issue, yet the Protonotarie must enter the judgment, if it be after
verdict. They also make Writs of Supersedeas, in case where the Defendant
appears in their Officers after the Capias awarded.

Saint Pancras.
In this old weather-beaten Church (standing all alone as utterly forsaken,....

which for antiquity will not yield to Saint Paul's in London) I find a
wondrous ancient Monument, which by tradition was made to the memory of one of
the right honorable family of the Greyes, and his Lady; whose pourtraitures
are upon the Tomb. Whose mansion house, say the Inhabitants, was in
Port-Poole, or Greyes-Inne-lane, now an Inn of Court. But these are but
suppositions: for by whom Greyes-Inne was first possessed, Suruay Land.

But things transitory pass and vanische sone,

That to his honowre, and to the bringing up of youth,
And to the succowre of the Age; for sewerly this is soth.
By Avise my wyff children were left me non
Which we both did take as God had it sent;
And fixed our minds that jointly in on,
To releue the poor by mutual consent.
Now merciful Jesus which have assystyd owre intent,
Have mercy on owre sowles, and as for the residew,
If it be thy will thou may owre Act continue.

To make this Act to continue for ever.


This pious act here mentioned in this Epitaph, is a free-Schoole, founded at
Radcliffe in this Parish, by the said Nicholas and Avise for the instruction of
threescore poor men's children, by a Schoolmaster and an Usher; with an
Almeshouse, for fourteen poor aged persons: and this Foundation continues to

Saint Leonards in Stratford Bow.
This religious structure was sometime a Monastery, replenished with white
Monks, dedicated to the honor of our alone Savior Jesus Christ and Saint
Leonard: founded by King Henry the second, in the 23. year of his reign. And
valued at the suppression to be yearly worth an hundred one and twenty pounds
sixteen shillings.

In this Abbey Church sometime lay entombed the body of John de Bohun, John
^^^le o^ Hereford.
eldest son and heir of Humfrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Essex. Which
John de Bohun (to use the words of Milles in his Catalogue of Hereford Earls)
after the death of his father Humfrey, was fifth Earl of Hereford, Constable
of England, and Patron of the Abbey of Lanthony, fourth Earl of Essex (of that
Surname) and fifth Lord of Brecknock.

Because this Earl John in regard of his weakness of body, by a continual
sickness, was not able to perform this office of the Constableship of
England, Edward the third, at this Earls entreaty, did substitute Edward
Bohun, the Earls younger brother, Vice-Constable under him, for the term of
his life. But Earl John died at Kirby Thore the 20. of January, upon Saint
Fabian and Sebastians day, 1136. the tenth of Edward the third leaving no
issue: and was buried at Stratford Abbey not far from London.

This John married first Alice, the daughter of Edmund Fitz-alan, Earl of
Arundell, who died in childbed; and was buried at Walden with her Infant son
after it was christened.

His second wife was Margaret, daughter of Raphe, Lord Basset of Dr^yton, a
Baron of the best rank in those days, by whom he had no issue.

This John was in especial favor, and did wonderfully flourish in the service
of King Henry the sixth. A family of great antiquity in the County of York.

By these Funeral Monuments it appears, that diverse Princes of this Land,
have often made their residence in this Town; by which means it has been in
former times of great state, estimation, and beauty, but now for want of that
general conuention, the Castle (built before the Conquest, by Edward the
Elder) is greatly decayed, these Parish Churches much ruined, and the Town
neither greatly inhabited, nor much frequented.

Here in this Town was a Priory of black Monks, valued in the Exchequer,
Foundation of the Priory in Heart.
to be yearly worth fourscore and six pounds, fourteen shillings, eight
pence. A Cell it was to Saint Albans, founded by Raph Limsey, a Nobleman, and
dedicated to the Virgin Mary, in the reign of the Conqueror. I have my
authority out of the Collections of Thomas Talbot, sometime keeper of the
Records in the Tower, a great Genealogist; these are his words.

nevertheless, grew ungrateful to King Edward his aduancer, in reuolting from

qualities so devoutly honored after his death, that all passengers by that way
on Horseback, thought themselves bound to bring their Steedes into the
Church, even up to the high Altar, where this holy Horseman was shrined, and
where a Priest continually attended, to bestow such fragments of Eppalets
miracles, as would either tame young horses, cure lame iades, or refresh old,
wearied, and forworne Hackneyes: which did avail so much the more or less, as
the passengers were bountiful or hard-handed.

Here is an ancient Monument, and an old Inscription which I often meet with.

Farwell my frendys, the tydabidyth no man,

But in this pasage the best song I can
Is Requiem Eternam, now Jesus grant it me.
When I have ended all mine adversity
Grant me in Paradys to have a mansion
That shedst thy blood for my redemption.

Roiston.
Rohesia the daughter of Aubrey de Vere, The foundation of the Cross, the

chief Justice of England under Henry the first (sister to Aubrey de Vere, the
first Earl of Oxford: and wife to Geffrey Magna-ville, or Mandevill, the first
Earl of Essex) erected (where now this Town of Roiston stands) a Cross in
the highway, which was thought in that age a pious work, to put passengers in
mind of Christ's passion: whereupon it was called, Crux Rohesiae, before there
was either Church or Town. But afterward (says Vincent out of the Records in
the Tower) when Eustach de Merch knight, Lord of Nauells in this tract, Rot
chart an. 18 E. 2.12.7.
had adjoined thereunto a little Monastery of Canons regular in honor of S.
Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury, then were Innes built here: So that in
process of time by little and little, it grew to be a Town; which in stead of
Rohesiaes Cross, was called Rohesiaes Town, and now contracted into Roiston.
This Priory was augmented in her revenues, and renewed by Radulphus de
Runcester, and others. Richard the first gives and confirms, Monasterio Sancti
Thome Martyris apud crucem Rohesie and Canonicis ibidem, locum ipsum in quo
idem Monasterium fundatum est, cum pertinentiis suis, que Eustachius de Merc

Here in this Town was also an Hospital (by whom founded I cannot learn)

Saint Albans Abbey.
^
I think it not much amiss to speak a little of this Protomartyr of England,
Saint Alban, whose relics lie here interred, to whose name, and for his
eternal commemoration, both this Town and Monastery were built and
consecrated.

He was a Citizen and a Knight of that famous City Verulam, (which stood
hereby beyond the little river) who giving entertainment at his own house, to
Amphibalus a Christian, and one of the Clergy, was by him his guest, converted
from Paganism, to the true profession of Jesus Christ: and when Dioclesian
(who made Maximian his companion in the Empire) went about by exquisite
torments, to wipe Christian Religion quite out of the memory of men, was the
first in Britain, that with invincible constancy and resolution, suffered
death for Christ his sake: of which persecution, ^s also of his Martyrdom, my
often alleged Author, Robert of Gloucester, shall tell you in his old verse.

Two Emperors of Rome were on Dioclesian,
And anoder his felaw that het Maximian.
And were both at on tym, the on in the Este end,
The oder in the west of the world, all cristendom to shende.
For the luther Maximian westwarde hider sought,
And christen men that he fond to strange death he brought.
Churchen he pulde a down, there ne most non stand,
And all the books that he might find in any land,
He would late berne echon, amydde the heygh street,
And the christenmen asle, and non alive let.
Such God was yvor upon cristendom.
Such persecucion as there was had there be non.
For yun^a monethe there were seuentene thou send and mo,
I martred for our Lords Love: nas there a great woe?
With out oder great halwen that hii heold long in torment.
As Saint Cristene, and Saint Feye, and also Saint Uincent,
Fabian and Sebastian, and othur as men read,
That heold fast in the fey, and had non dread,
And among men of this land there were many on
I martred at thulke tym, Seint Albon was on:
He was the furste Martyr of Brutayn that com
Much was the shome men dude in Christendom,
Undyr this Luther Emperor.
Another not so ancient, has it thus.

The Emperor Dioclesyan Into Britayne then sent Maximian: Hardin cap. ^7.

This Maximian to surname Hercelius,
A Tyraunte false that Christente anoyed,
Through all Britayne, of work malicious,
The christoned folk felly and sore destroyed.
And thus the people with him foul accloyed,
Religyous men the Prests and Clerks all*
Women with child and bedred folks all.
Children soukyng upon the mothers pappis,
The mothers also withouten any pytee,
And children all in their mothers lappis
The crepyls eke and all the christentee,
He killed and slew with full great cruelte.
The Churches brent, all books or ornaments
Bellys, reliquys that to the Church appendes,
He slew that time, and martyred Saint Albone.
Now when neither persuasions, nor cruel torments, could make him forsake the
true faith, Iacobus de ^^ragine, translated.
such was the sentence of his death, as I find it in a legend of his passion
and martyrdom, which to give your palate variety, I will set down in such
English as I have in the said Legend, or Agon.

In the time of the Emperor Dioclesyan, Albone Lord of Uerolamye, Prince of
Knyghts, and Steward of all Brutayne during his lif, has despysyd Jupiter
and Apollo.
Iubyter and Apollyn our Gods; and to them has do derogacyon and
disworschyp, wherefore by the Law, he is judged to be deed by the hand of sum
knight, and the body to be buried in the same place, where his heed shall be
smyten of, and his sepulture to be made worshcipfully for thonoure of
knyghthode whereof he was Prince, and also the cross which he bare, and A
Palmers Weed.
Sklauin that he ware should be buried with him, and his body to be closyd in a
Cheste of leed, and so laid in his sepulture: This sentence has the Law
ordained, by cause he has renyed our principal Gods.

His judgment being given after this manner, he was brought from the City
Veralam, to this his place of execution, which, as then, was an hill in a wood,
called Holme-hurst, where at one stroke his head was smitten off. But his
Executioner, says venerable Bede, Bed lib. 1. c. ^.
had short joy of his wicked deed, for his eyes fell to the ground, with the
head of the holy Martyr: of which will you hear another writer.

Thousands of torments when he had endured for Christ his sake, Vid Camd. in
Heart.

At length he died by dome thus given; his head away to take.
The Tortor proudly did the feat, but clear he went not quit,
That holy Martyr lost his head, this cruel wretch his sight.
He suffered martyrdom in the year of Christ, says Stow, 293. the twentieth
day of June, says Bid, howsoever the two and twentieth day of the same
month* was appointed by the Church, to be kept holy to his memory, as we have
it in our English Calender.

Many Miracles are said to be wrought by this sacred Martyr, both living and
dead, but I will leave them, (for that they will be thought incredulous in this
age) and come to the foundation of this Abbey.

The Sepulchers of holy Saints, the relics of blessed Martyrs, and the very
places of their martyrdom, The foundation of S. Albans Abbey.
did kindle, in times past, no small heat of divine charity in the minds of
our first Christian Saxon Kings; which made Offa the glorious King of the
Mercians, to recall himself from the trace of bloody wars, in great devotion
to go to Rome, and to obtain of Pope Adrian the first, the canonyzation of
this martyr Alban; in honor of whom, the first to our Lord Jesus Christ, he
founded this monastery, about the year 795. (the Church whereof still
remains, which for bigness, beauty, and antiquity, is to be had in
admiration) in the very place where the foresaid Alban suffered his martyrdom.
He endowed this his g^odly fabric, with sufficient revenues for the
maintenance of one hundred black Monks, Benedictins, and caused the relics
of his new Saint to be taken up, and put in a shrine, adorned with gold and
precious stones of inestimable value; which was further enriched by his son
Egfrid, and many other succeeding Kings and Princes, but now at this day,
nothing is remaining of this rich Shrine, save a marble stone, to cover his
sacred Ashes; over against which, on the wall, these verses are lately
depicted, only to tell us that such a man there was, to whose memory a Shrine
was erected.

Renowned Alban knight, first Martyr of this land,
By Dioclesian lost his life through bloody hand.
Who made him sovereign Lord, high Steward of this Isle,
And Prince of Britain knights to dignifie his style,
He verity embraced, and Verulam forsook,
And in this very place his martyrdom he took.
Now has he his reward, he lives with Christ above,
For he above all things, Christ and his truth did love.
Here Offa, Mercians King, did Albans bones enshrine,
So all things were disposed by providence divine.
Naught but this marble stone of Albans Shrine is left,
The work of all form else, has changing time bereft.
I have read in an old Mss. in Sir Robert Cottons Library, that this
following, was anciently the Inscription upon his Shrine.

Here lies interred, the body of Saint Alban, a Citizen of old Verulam, of
whom this town took denomination, and from the ruins of which City, this
Town did arise. He was the first Martyr of England, and suffered his
martyrdom the xx. day of June, in the year of man's redemption, 293.

Under a curious and costly funeral monument here in the Quire, lies interred
the body of Vmfrey Plantaginet, Vm^hrey Duke of Gloucester. Milles Catal.
surnamed the Good, fourth son of King Henry the fourth. By the grace of God
(for so begins his style by Charter) son, brother, and uncle of Kings, Duke
of Gloucester, Earl of Henault, Holland, Zeland, and Pembroke, Lord of
Friseland, great Chamberlain of England, Protector and defender of the Church
and kingdom of England. Thus great, thus glorious, by birth, creation, and
marriage, was he in his honorable titles and Princely attributes; but far
more great, and illustrious, in his virtuous endowments, and inward qualities:
But in his praise, may it please you read learned Clarentieux, in his tract of
Suffolk, where he writes of the Abbey of Bury: these are his words. That
father of his country, Vmfrey Duke of Gloucester, a due obseruer of Justice,
and one who had furnished his noble wit, with the better and deeper kind of
Studies, after he had, under King Henry the sixth, governed the kingdom five
and twenty years with great commendations; so that neither good men had cause
to complain of, nor enuill to find fault with, was here in Saint Saviors
Hospital brought to his (...) by the spightfull envy of Margaret of Lorain,
who was wife to Hen^^ the ^ix^h his Nephew. But his death was the stroke of an
evil Angel, Speed.
(...)ent to punish England, and to root out all her Nobles.

Says the Abbot of this house Io. Whethamsted; yet for all this was he
arrested of high Treason, in the year 1446. and within few days after
strangled to death; Stow. Annal.
without any trial. Some say he died for sorrow, because he might not come to
his answer. He built the Divinity School in Oxford, and was an especial
benefactour to this Abbey. Here is an Epitaph pensild on the wall near to his
Tomb, to the same effect; with an Item of the miracle which he wrought upon
the blind imposture. The story is frequent.

own name was called John; and also to new glase the Cloisters, Sibi igitur
(says the book) ea sit merces, que dari solet illis qui ad honorem sue
Ecclesie, laudabilia student opera in temporibus suis.

Upon a Prior of this house.
Vir crucis and Christi tumulo iacet inclitus isti,
Carcere de tristi saluetur sanguine Christi.
Armacrucis sumpsit intrando Religionem;
Mundum contempsit propter celi regionem.
Hic studuit claustri Pondus sufferre laboris,
In stadio studij a reward.
brauium percepit honoris:
Flatus fortune grandes patiens tolerabat,
Gaudia, tristitia, equalilance librabat.
Nil aduersa timens, nec multum prospera curans;
Se medio tenuit; per ferrea tempora durans.
Omni gestura constans nil triste timebat;
Omni pressura Christo lauds referebat.
Armis Iustitie cinctus deitatis amore
Hostibus Ecclesie restitit in facie.
Ad tumulum Proceres mors impia transferet omnes;
Vt puerilis amor defluit omnis honor.
I find this Inscription following upon a fair marble, under the pourtraiture
of one of the Abbots, who modestly thus suppresseth his name.

Hic quidem terra tegitur
Peccato soluens debitum.
Cuius nomen non impositum,
In libro vitae sit inscriptum.
Michael Abbot
Hic iacet Dominus Michael quondam Abbas huius Monasterij Bachalaureus in
Theol. qui obiit pridie Idus Aprilis Ann. M.ccc xlii.

Michael Abbas (says the said book of S. Albans) merito nomen Angelicum est
sortitus, nam opera que ipse fecit, ostendunt qualis fuerit. Fuitque in omni
vita tam pius suis fratribus and mansuetus, vt inter eos merito tanquam Angelus
haberetur.

Gulielmus quartus opus hoc laudabile, cuius
Extitit, hic pausat, Christo sibi premia reddat.
This Abbots name was William Wallingford, a man abundantly charitable to the
poor, and munificent to the Church. His gifts to both did amount to the sum
of eight thousand and threescore pounds seven shillings and six pence
(confirmed in the said book) by Thomas Ramridge then Prior, and the rest of
the Covent, in the year 1484. Die octauo men's. Augusti; concluding with these
words: Ex his igitur premissis manifestissime cernere possumus, quam vtilis and
quam carissimus suo olim Monasterio extiterit. Ea propter sinceris omnes
cordilus, ad omnipotentem deum, pro eo precaturi dies ac noctes deuotissime
sumus, vt sibi in celis mercedem suis factis dignissimam retribuere dignetur.
Amen.

Hic iacet... Th^mas Abbot.
Thomas Abbas huins Monastery....

This is the last Abbot for whom I find any Inscription, or Epitaph, and the
last in my Catalogue: whose Surname was Ramrige, Vir suis temporibus tam
dilectus deo quam hominibus, propterque causas varias nomen in perpetua
benedictione apud posteros habens* says the golden Register.

Here I may have occasion to set down the names of all the Abbots of this
House, In bib. Cott.
from the first foundation to this man; and the rather because I have certain
Epitaphs in some of their commendations, collected out of the Abbey book,
which sometime were engraven upon their Monuments: besides other passages are
thereby discovered, not unpleasing to the Reader.

When Offa the Founder had built and endowed this Monastery, ^illigod the
first Abbot.
with more then twenty Lordships and Manors, and obtained for it all royal
privileges, and pontifical ornaments: he made choice of one Willigod, to have
the government of these possessions and prerogatives, as also of the religious
persons by him to his Abbey promoted. This man did laudablie govern his charge
for many years.

2. Eadrick succeeded him, a severe punisher of malefactors.

3. Then Wulsigge.

4. Wulnoth, in this Abbots time many miracles are said to be wrought at Saint
Albons Shrine.

5. Eadfride: this Abbot gave a massy cup of gold, or challice of inestimable
value to the Shrine of Saint Albon.

6. Wulfine, a village of a few houses being here already built near to the
Monastery, this Abbot procured a Market there to be kept; and called together
people of other villages therein to inhabit. He built the Churches of Saint
Peter and Saint Michael in this Town, and a Chapel near to S. Germans
Chapel, which he dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene.

7. Alfricke, this Abbot for a great sum of money purchased a large and deep
pond, lying betwixt old Verulam and this village (an evil neighbor and
hurtful to his Church) which was called the Fish poole, appertaining to the
kings: and the Kings officers and Fishers molested the Abbey, and burdened the
Monks thereby. Out of which Poole he the said Abbot in the end drained the
water, and made it dry ground. The name of which Pond or Poole remains still
here in a certain street, called Fish-poole street.

9. Ealdred, the Abbot in the reign of king Edgar, having searched for the
ancient vaults under ground at Verulam, overthrew all, and stopped up all the
ways with passages under ground; which were strongly and artificially arched
over head: For they were the lurking holes of whores and thieves. He leuelled
the ditches of the City, and certain dens, into which malefactors use to
fly, as unto places of refuge. But the whole tiles and stones which he found
fit for building, he laid aside; intending therewith to have reedified his
Church, but he was prevented by death.

9. Eadmer his Successor went forward with the work that Ealfred began, and
his pioners overthrew the foundations of a palace in the midst of the old
City: And in the hollow place of a wall, as it were in a little closet, they
happened upon books, covered with oaken boards, and silken strings at them:
whereof one contained the life of Saint Alban, written in the British tongue;
the rest, the ceremonies of the Heathen. When they opened the ground deeper,
they met with old tables of stone, with tiles also and pillars, likewise with
pitchers and pots of earth, made by Potters and Turners work: vessels
moreover of glass, containing the ashes of the dead, etc. To conclude, out of
these remains of Verulam, Eadmer built a new the most part of his Church and
Monastery; with a determination to have finished all: Sed tamen morte
preuentus, says the book, propositum suum non est assecutus.

10. Leofricke was preferred to the Archbishopricke of Canterbury, who
departing with the benediction of his brethren, left his Monastery abundantly
rich. This man is omitted in the Catalogue of Bishops, or otherwise Aluric^us
or Alfricus is set in his place.

11. This Alfricke or Aluricke was the eleventh Abbot, and brother by the
mothers side to his predecessor Leofricke; he compiled an History of the life
and death of Saint Alban, and he, together with his brother, got and gave nine
villages to this Abbey.

12 Leofstane procured many great and important liberties to his Church, of
Edward the Counfessour, whose Chaplain and Confessor the said Abbot was; and
who, betwixt the King and his Queen Editha, was Casti consilij seminator.

13. Frederick the bold and rich Abbot of Saint Albans (for so he was called)
succeeded Leofstane, descended from the Saxons noble blood, as likewise from
Canutus the Dane: this man opposed the Conqueror William in all his
proceedings, plotted against him in diverse conspiracies, and told him stoutly
to his face, that he had done nothing but the duty of his birth and
profession; and if others of his rank had performed the like (as they well
might and ought) it had not been in his power to have pierced the land so
far. But this, and other his ouer-bold answers, did so offend the King, that
he took from him this Abbey of Saint Albans, with all the lands and revenues
belonging thereunto, which lay betwixt Barnet and London stone. Whereupon,
without delay, he called a Chapter of his Brethren, showing them their
approaching dangers, and to avoid the present storm, went himself to Ely
(where he desisted not from his wonted machinations against the Conqueror) and
there ended his days, in magna mentis amaritudine (says mine Author) postquam
multis annis huic Ecclesie nobiliter prefuisset.

14. Paul a Monk of Cane, upon his death, was made Abbot, who in short space
by the counsel and aid of Lanfranke, Archbishop of Canterbury, builded very
sumptuously a new Church, with a Cloister here, with a^l offices; and adorned
the same Church with many good books, and rich ornaments. He procured his
lands and revenues back again from the Conqueror; and by himself, and his
forcible persuasions with others, he did further enrich his Abbey with many
fair possessions.

15 Richard succeeded him, who solemnly and magnificently did consecrate the
Church, which his predecessor Paul had finished, and built a Chapel of
himself to the honor of Saint Cuthbert, in which he was entombed, with this
Epitaph.

Abbas Richardus iacet hic, vt pistica nardus
Redolens virtutum floribus et merit is.
A quo fundatus locus est hic, edisicatus
Ingenti studio nec modico precio.
Quem nonas decimas Februo promente Kalendas,
Abslulit vltima sors, et rapuit cita mors.
16 Geffrey the Abbot gave many rich ornaments to this his Monastery, with a
Challice and a cover all of massy pure gold, which afterward he sent to Pope
Celestine the second, vt ipsius sedaret auaritiam, volent is hanc Ecclesiam
appropriare; that he might appease or mitigate the covetousness of his holy
father of Rome, who was willing (and went about) to impropriate this Abbey.

Abbas Galfridus Papa cui fuit ipse molestus
Hic iacet innocuus, prudens, pius, atque modeslus.
17 Raph his successor, built anew the lodgings for the Abbots, and gave diverse
rich Copes and Vestments for the ornament of his Church.

18 Robert was the next Abbot who procured the Church of Luton to be annexed to
this, S. Albans exempre from the (...) of Lincoln
and delivered his Monastery from the servitude of the Bishop of Lincoln,
which was a controversy of long continuance, and in the end agreed upon by
composition; which agreement was confirmed by Alexander the third, Bishop of
Rome, about the year 1178. as by his Bull to that purpose appearent.

Bulla de compositione facta inter Lincoln. Ecclesiam et Ecclesiam beati Albani.
Alexander Episcopus seruus seruoru^ Dei. Dilecto filio Roberto Abbati

Statuentes vt nulli omnino hominum liceat hanc paginam nostre confirmationis

nostri, anno vij.

About twenty years afterward, (upon some new quarrels, belike, arising
between the two foresaid Churches) this composition and transaction was again
confirmed by Clemens the third, in these words.

Clemens Episcopus seruus seruorum dei; dilectis filijs Abbati et conuentui
Sancti Albani, Salutem et Apostol^cam ben. Cum inter vos ex vna part et

19 Simon Abbot caused many books to be written for the use of the Covent; in
his time, one Adam, Steward of the monastery, made the Kitchen much more large,
and gave both money and lands to the Covent and Monastery, ideo (says my
Author) ob preclara eius merita inter Abbates in capitulo sepulturam meruit
optinere; therefore for his good deserts, he deserved to be buried in the
Chapter House amongst the Abbots.

20 Carine caused a coffin and a Shrine to be new made, wherein he put the
relics of Saint Amphibalus. Richard Cordelion, King of England, being taken
prisoner by Leopold Duke of Austria, and his ransom set at one hundred
thousand pound; commandment was directed from his Justices, that all Bishops,
Prelates, Earls, Barons, Abbots, and Priors, should bring in the fourth part
of their revenues toward his deliverance: at which time the shrines in the
Churches were fleeced, and their Chalices coined into ready money, yet this
Abbot (quia Regi erat amicissimus) redeemed the Chalices, and all other the
rich offerings to the glorious shrines within his Church, for two hundred
marks. This Carine was the first Abbot of this house, that was dignified with
Miter and Croisier.

21 John de Cella did many works of piety, and purchased the Church of Saint
Stephen, with certain lands thereunto adjoining, for one hundred and twenty
marks, which he did assign to the Officers of his Kitchen.

22 William, amongst many of his pious acts, reedified Saint Cuthberts
Chapel, being as then ruinous and ready to fall down; which he new made in
the honor of Saint Cuthbert, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Agnes the
Virgin; upon which dedication he caused these verses to be insculped over the
high Altar.

Confessor Cuthberte Dei Baptista Johannes,
Agnes virgo, tribus vobis hec ara sacratur.
23 John of Hertford was a great benefactor to this Abbey.

24 His successor Roger did wondrously love the beauty of the house of God,
which he evidently did demonstrate by the great cost and charges he bestowed
upon this his own Church: besides, he caused to be made, three tunable Bells
for the Steeple, two to the honor of Saint Alban, and the third to Saint
Amphibalus, which he appointed to be rung at nine a clock every night;
whereupon it was called the Corfue, or cover fire bell.

25 After Roger, succeeded John of Berkamstede, of whom because he did nothing
memorable in his life time, nothing shall be spoken in this present page; Sed
taman Lectorem monemus (says the Book) vt conuertatur ad pietatis opera, et
omnipotenti deo pro eius anima preces fundat.

26 John Marines gave a Censer to his church, of a great price, besides many
other necessaries.

27 Hugh his successor, enlarged the revenues of his church with many fair
possessions, and obtained of Edward the second, diverse great gifts, with a
crucifixe of gold, beset with precious stones; a cup of silver of great value,
gilt, diverse Scottish relics. Timber to repair the Quire, and one hundred
pound in money.

Quid fuit, est, et erit, cur non homo discere querit?
Spuma fuit, fumus est: putrida fiet humus.
28 Abbot Richard, endued with all kinds of learning, both moral and divine,
suffered great tribulation in his time, in the defense of the rights of his
church. He gave a clock to the same, the like of it was not in England.

29 Of Michael the Abbot I have spoken before.

30 Upon the death of Michael, Thomas the Prior of Tinmouth was preferred to
this monastery: he sustained innumerable crosses and perturbations, during the
time of his being at Tinmouth, as also here at Saint Albanes: yet brought all
to a prosperous end, and adorned his church more richly, then any one of his
Predecessors; the particular gifts that he gave to the same, cost him above
four thousand pound.

Est Abbas Thomas, tumulo present reclusus
Qui vite tempus sanctos expendit in vsus.
31 The next Abbot was John Moot, qui multa fecit diebus suis memoranda, says
my Author, of whom this Epitaph.

M. C. quater vint. quint. Claudis heic membra Ioannis,
Qui dignis laudibus veteranis occidit annis:
Intus confratres been rexit, post fuit Abbas
Constans vt Joshua, Zelans legem vt H^lias.
Simplicitas vite qua noscitur esse columbe.
Simonis et Jude (pie pastor) cras rapuit te.
Omnem patratum Christus purgando reatum,
Nobis sublatum te mun^ret his sociatum.
32 William his next successor, was vir suis in temporibus tam deo delectus
quam hominibus, and performed many great works of piety. He died about the
year 1434. for whom I find this Epitaph.

Conditus his recubat fatali sort Guilelmus
Albani Pastor qui gregis aptus erat:
Reperit illustrem celesti munere famam,
Quam nequit in tanto mors abolere viro.
33 But now I come to John of Whethamstede, (a village in this shire,
plentiful in wheat) (wherein the said John was borne, and thereupon had his
denomination,) who was Abbot of this house, in the reign of Henry the sixth, a
man much renowned for his due desert of learning, for his godly life and
conversation, for his pleasant disposition, and for the charges he was at, and
the means he made, to adorn and enrich his Church and monastery. Out of a
Manuscript in Sir Robert Cot^ons rich Library, entitled, Gesta paucula
Abbatis Iohannis Sexti, I collected thus much of his particular actions.

John, the sixth Abbot of this house, of that christian name, that he might
outwardly show, says the book, how inwardly he loved the beauty of the
house of God, and how much he desired to deck and embellish the habitation of
the most holy; first he caused our Ladies chapel to be new trimmed, and
curiously depicted, with stories out of the sacred word: upon the south side
whereof, these verses were curiously depensed in gold.

Dulce pluit Manna partum dum protulit Anna,
Dulcius ancilla dum Christus creuit in illa.
Upon the north side these.

Flos Campi dicta tibi question...... puella
Floris habens picta venerari fronde capella.
In the roof about the picture of the Lamb.

Inter oues Aries regat vt sine cornibus agnus:
Under the picture of the Eagle.

Inter aues Aquila veluti sine fell columba.
He built a little Chapel in the south part of the Church for his own
burial place, in which under certain pictures in the windows, he caused
these verses to be inscribed.

Propicij Patres, compassiue quoque matres
Orat, vt oretis, sua quod sit pausa quietis
Vester adoptatus hic filius intumulatus.
The north part of his Church being somewhat dark, he caused new windows to
be made, and glazed, to make it appear more light and glorious; and in the
glass, under the images of certain heathen Philosophers, which had testified
of the incarnation of Jesus Christ; these Hexameters were inscribed. Istac qui
graderis hos testes si memoreris:
Credere vim poteris proles Deus est mulieris.
Under the picture of Joseph of Arimathia in another window.

Ad Britones ivi postquam Christum sepeliui,
Glasconiam veni, Britones docui, requieui.
Under the pictures of the four Doctors of the Church.

Bina per hec paria fidei quod gignit alumpna
Firma stat Ecclesia, quadra fulcita columpna.
And that he might further illuminate his Church, he caused a fair large
window to be made anew in the West end of the said North Isle. Upon the
erection of which these rimes were composed. In patria boree quo plus durabilis
in se,
Fertur petra fore factor fuit ipse fenestre,
Que nunc erigitur in ea quoque part locatur;
Totius Ecclesie que fertur clarior esse,
Eius and occiduam been ditat lumine finem.
He made a reverend kind of imbroidered vesture, for himself and his
successors, to use when they were to enter into their Sanctum Sanctorum: he
made a new Miter, and a Pastoral staff. Upon which this meter was carved.
Postquam sex annis benedixit dextra Iohannis
Wethamsted, pepulum fecerat hunc baculum.
For the use and honor of the holy Altar, he made a Chalice of pure gold, a
pair of silver censers; a pair of silver Basins gilt. Upon which were
engraven the similitudes of a Lamb and an Eagle, with these riming verses.

Peluis post latices vt lota manus veniales
Conficiat calices: prius annuat Agnus and Ales.
Upon the pictures of Christ, the blessed Virgin, Saint Alban, and the sacred
Host, as they were to be carried in the Cloister, or into the Town; he caused
diverse verses to be written, to bring the people into a reverend regard of the
same. Vt Jesus and matter, noster simul Prothomartyr
Acetu populi deberent plus venerari.
Instituit, varia quibus and veneratio dicta
Creuit, and Ecclesie cultus fuit amplior in se.
Of all his pious acts which he performed for the ornament of his Church, thus
much is written (briefly) in the same book.

In cappis, casulis, Albis, simul and tunicellis,
Inque bonis alijs varijs magis ac preciosis;
Precessit patres pater hic cunctos preeuntes.
Plus coluit que Deum, cur recolamus eum.
In like manner he trimmed up his Monastery, with curious painted imageries
and diverse inscriptions in golden letters. In his own lodgings.
Dote licet multa tua sit species been culta,
Mos nisi nubat ei dos simplicis est speciei.
Ortus magnorum quamuis sis stirpe deorum;
Iunge tibi morem facis ortum nobiliorem.
Inter eos quos fama deos in honor leuavit;
Sors famulos, mors discipulos in sine probauit.
In the walk betwixt the Hall and the Abbots Chamber:
Hec in regnante duo sunt contraria valde,
Sedis apex primus, probitatis spiritus ymus.
Sis Dux munificus, sis prudens, sisque benignus,
Tresque Duces simul es Eneas, Titus, Vlixes.
Non been concessum princeps regit ille Ducatum,
Concilio procerum qui non regitur sapientum.
Iudex quando seeds caneas ne iura supines
Iure quidem tradito. Plebs Rex est, Rex sine regno?
In the windows of the Abbots Study, or Library.
Cum studeas, videas, vt sit virtus and honestas;
Hic and vbique tibi finalis causa studendi.
Hec loca sceptrigere pudeat sacrate Sophie
Hoc ad opus trahere quod mandat Martha Marie.
Huius amore loci regimen postponere noli.
Quo minor esca gregi detur magis esurienti.
In the Chamber adjoining to his Study.
Condere ne timeas quicquid persuadet honestas:
Gratia propositis semper respondet honestis.
He gave a great Basin of silver double gilt, to the Monastery, which he thus
engraued about the Verge.

Dic quisquis fueris been domi si memoreris
Quis fueratque dator, nunqui suus esse precator,
Sieve prees ve subes, propter donum tenearis.
Si ^ic hortor te pro donatore precare;
Dicque perhennis e^ sit lux que locus requie^.
In a Chapel which he built for the Covent, these verses.

Turma senectutis, plebs egra, cohorsque salutis
In vestris precibus Are sacra cum celebratis;
Hanc propter fabricam sextum memorate Iohannem.
After this manner did he adorn, new build, and enrich both his Church and
Abbey; and in all his new buildings or repairings, he caused the pictures of a
Lamb and an Eagle to be thereupon drawn or depicted with these verses
following; which you may read upon the roof or top of the Quire in the Abbey
Church at this day. Dic vbicunque vides sit pictus vt Agnus and Ales
Effigies operis, sexti sunt ista Iohannis
Part vel in toto in visse, vel in faciendo
Est opus hoc vnum causauit eum faciendum.
He built much at his Manor of Titten-Hanger not far from hence, and in his
Study there inscribed these verses.

Ipse Iohannis amor Whethamslede vbique proclamor,
Eius and alter honor hic lucis in ange reponor.
In a Chapel there which he much enlarged, he caused to be painted upon the
walls the similitudes of all the Saints of his own Christian name of John:
with his own picture, which seemingly thus prays. Cum fero par nomen, par
far precor simul omen;
Tum paribus que pari, licet impar, luce locari.
He repaired or rather built anew the Church of Redburne, and consecrated the
altar again: over which these verses were written upon the wall. M. semel x.
terno C quater ^ quoque querno
Ara resecrata, domus hec varijsque nouata.
Upon the covering or roof over the Chancell, under the pictures of the Lamb
and Eagle, these. Ecce pecus mundi to^lens peccata rotundi.
En et auis, celi reserans arcana fideli.
En pecus en et auis, opus en sextique Iohannis.
He built a Library in the Monks College in Oxford, to which he gave many
books, in some of which he writ these verses. Fratribus Oxonie datur in munus
liber iste.
Per patrem pecorum Prothomartyris Angligenorum.
Quem siquis rapiat ad partem sieve reponat.
Vel Jude laqueum, vel furcas sentiat Amen.
In other of the books which he gave to the said Library, these. Discior vt
docti fieret noua regia plebi
Culta magisque Dee datur hic liber ara Minerue,
His qui dijs dictis libant holocausta ministris.
Et Cirre bibulam sitiunt pre Nectare lympham,
Estque librique loci, idem dator, actor et vnus.
He built also a Chapel adjoining to the Library, and in the principal
window under the pictures of the Crucifix, the Virgin Mary, and Saint John
Baptist, he caused these deprecatory times to be put in the glass. Mors
medicina necis; via vite, pax populatus,
Sis spes prompta precis, lex cure, laus Monachatus.
Ma^ris mesticia, mors prolis, vulnera quina,
Sint m^a leticia fati pulsante ruina.
Virginis imbutor, fidei fortiss^me tutor,
Nominis vt reputor seror omnis oro secutor.
He bestowed great charges upon the Abbots lodging-house in London.

By his wisdom he did so mediate with Vmfrey, Duke of Gloucester, that he g^ue
to this Church ( ornatus vestimentorum) a suite of vestments worth three
thousand marks; with the Manor of Pembroke in South Wales, for that the
Monks should pray for his soul; and chose this Church for the place of his
burial. Upon which, these rimes. Vltraiam dicta, que sunt numero satis ampla,
Dives item cella Penbrok a plebe vocata:
Per patris media fuit Ecclesie propriata;
Ossa tegique sua legit, Propriator, in ipsa.
He gave much to the Churches of Winslow and Newenham, and other Churches in
London. He gave a challice of pure gold and of great weight to the Priory of
Tinmouth, where he was brought up as a Scholar, a Challice to Wallingford,
another to the Church of Worcester. An estimate of his charitable and pious
devotions to this and other Churches, you may see in these two lines, beside
what money and goods he bequeathed upon his deathbed.

Summa prius dicta si sit sine fraud quotata
Bister millenas fertur transcendere libras.
And, preter gesta iam dicta, says the book, fecit Abbas prefatus multa alia
opera bona que non scripta in libro hoc. Hec antem scripta sunt vt glorificetur
deus in omnibus, qui dedit servulo suo gratiam ad peragendum hec paucula in
diebus suis. Et vt ea legant Fratres, atque legentes, vt ardentior^m habeant
appetitum ad orandum in specie pro anima eius.

He was a general good scholar; some fourscore and odd several Treatises
are set down in this book of Saint Albons, written by this Abbot. Before the
names whereof these verses.

Nomina librorum cum contentis and eorum
Quos frumentalis domino pressante, Johannes
Fecit vel scribi, fieri vel, vel renouaui.
Hic subscribuntur mentaliter vt teneantur.
He gave over his charge for a time, and undertook it again a little before
his death, which happened in the reign of Edward the fourth. He was buried in
his own Chapel which he had provided in his life time. To whose memory this
Epitaph was made by one of the Monks.

Contegit iste lapis venerabilis ossa Iohannis Epit. Iohannis Whe^hams^ede.

His next successor was John Stoke, of whom, as also of all the rest in the
Catalogue, I have already spoken: and now I will return back again to the
rest of the Epitaphs and Inscriptions which I find in the Church.

the famous Trauailer, who writ in Latin, French, and in the English tongue,

of the Inhabitants to be true, they have lately pensild a rare piece of
Poetry, or an Epitaph for him, upon a pillar; near to which, they suppose his
body to have been buried, which I think not much amiss to set down; for
although it will not be worth the reading, yet do but set it to some lofty
tune, as to the Hunting of Antichrist, or the like, I know it will be well
worth the singing: mark how it runs. All ye that pass, on this pillar cast
eye,
This Epitaph read if you can;
'Twill tell you a Tomb on^'t stood in this room,
Of a brave spirited man.
John Mandeuill by name, a knight of great fame,
Borne in this honored Town.
Before him was none that ever was known,
For travail of so high renown.
As the Knights in the Temple, crosse-legged in marble,
In armor, with sword and with sheeld,
So was this Knight graced, which time has defaced,
That nothing but ruins does yield.
His Travails being done, he shines like the Sun,
In heavenly Canaan.
To which blessed place, O Lord of his grace,
Bring us all man after man.
That he was borne here in this Town I cannot much deny; but I am sure that
within these few years, I saw his Tomb in the City of Leege, within the
Church of the religious house of the Guilliammits, with this Inscription upon
it, and the verses following hanging by on a table.

Hic iacet vir nobilis D. Ioannes de Mandevile, Al; D. ad Barbam miles; Dominus

Upon the same marble, under the picture of the Cross, these words are
engraven, which the foresaid Smith seems to speak. By this tokyn of the holy

This family is now extinct, and the inheritance diuolued by marriage unto the
Maynards, as appears by an Epitaph upon the wall not long since made for on
of the Maynards, who married one of the heirs of Sir Raph Rowlat knight.

To the picture of Christ hanging on the Cross, this inscription was lately to
be read upon one of the pillars in the Church.

Fly the falshode of the fiend for he will fownd the,
Dread not my dreadful doomes for I dyed for the.
Call on me thy Savior Christ, I can chere the
My mercy is more than thy miss, I may amend the Sea how my side was perced for the, and I shall help the.
In this Abbey Church is a goodly Font of solid brass, wherein the kings
children of Scotland were wont to be baptized; which Font Sir Richard Lea
knight, Master of the Pioners, brought as a spoil out of the Scottish wars,
and gave it to this Church. As may appear by this lofty and arrogant
inscription about the same; as if the Font in it own person did proclaim the
knights act to all passengers in these words, lately Englished.

When Leeth a Town of good account among the Scots, and Edinbrough their
chief City were on a fire, Sir Richard Lea knight, saved me from burning,
and brought me into England. And I being mindful of this so great a benefit,
whereas before I was wont to serve for baptizing of none but Kings children,
have now willingly offered my service even to the meanest of the English
Nation. Lea the Victour would have it so. Farewell. In the year of our Lord,
M.D.xliii. and of the reign of King Henry the eight xxxvi.

These already written are all the Epitaphs or inscriptions which I find in
this Abbey Church: howsoever it does retain the ashes of many a worthy man
conquered by death, Egfrid king of the Mercians.
both before and since the Conquest* As of Egfrid king of the Mercians, son
to great Offa the Founder, who added to those twenty Lordships or Manors,
wherewith his father at the first endowed this foundation: Ex Reg dea^r. S.
Albani in saepe dict. bib: Cott.
Terram quinque Maneriorum in loco dicto Pynefeld cum terminis suis antiquis;
and manerium de Sauntridge et Tirefeld: Cartas que Patris sui benign in suae
serena concessione confirmauit; pro confirmatione regni sui, and sua
prosperitate, nec non pro salute pattern sueque anime, and antecessorum suorum;
Ecclesiam suam per omnia salubriter protegendo: says the golden Register of
this Abbey.

The first business that this King undertook after he came to the Crown,
was the restoration of ancient privileges to the Church, and great hope was
conceived of his further proceedings, had not God cut him off by untimely
death, the 17. day of September, in the year of our Lord God, 796. and in the
first of his reign having had neither wife nor issue. His body with all due
obsequies was here Princely interred near to the Shrine of S. Alban.

Rob. Mowbray Earl of Northumberland, a Monk.
This Abbey Church was likewise honored with the Sepulture of Robert Mowbray,
Earl of Northumberland: whose story out of many writers is in this manner
extracted.

^ill Gemmet. Simon Daniel.
This Robert Mowbray, a most valiant Soldier, seeing his country destroyed,
and ouerrunne even unto Alnewicke castle, by Malcolme King of Scotland and his
army, made head against the said Malcolme (not staying for directions from his
King William Rufus) and so sore and suddenly distressed his forces, that both
king Malcolme himself, and his son Prince Edward were there slain.

Mat. Paris.
Hereupon this Earl growing proud, and greatly suspected by King William, began
to fortify the Kings Castles, with munition for Arms against the like
invasion, Speed ca ^.
and indeed against the Kings will; who sent him word somewhat roughly, to
desist from his doings, and presently to repair to his presence; which whilst
he lingered and neglected to do, king William sent his brother Henry to spoil
Northumberland, and immediately followed after himself, where without much
ado, he took the Earl, and committed him prisoner to Windsor Castle.

Hou in vit. Will. Rufi.

Ypodig. Neust.


This Robert Mowbray and William of Anco, with others, conspired to deprive the
King both of Crown and life, and to have set up Stephen de Albamarle his Aunts
son, as Houeden and Walsingham will have it. But I read in an old Manuscript
that he favoring the proceedings of Anselme, Ex lib. Ab. de Newburgh. in bib.
Cott.
Archbishop of Canterbury, Pro amore and bono Ecclesie innocentem vitam
finiebat. Cuius anime propitietur Deus. As the words are. Rex ipsum cum alijs
decollari mandauit: The king commanded that he, with others, should be
beheaded; his companion Anco being punished with loss both of his eyes, and
his virilitie.

Gemmelicensis lib. 7 ca 8.
He died in prison, says one writer, In ipso Ergastulo deficiens mortuus est,
regnante Henrico Rege. Whose Lands in Normandy, as also, for the most part,
here in England, the said King Henry gave to Nigell de Albeney, viro probo et
illustri.

Ordorus vitatis. lib. 7. pa. 649.
Another writer tells us, that he married Maud, the daughter of Richerius de
Aquila, a potent man in the Conquerours days, and that after four and thirty
years of imprisonment, he died without issue: in these words.

Mathildis autem potenti viro Roberto de Molbraio Comiti Norbandum* brorum
nupsit, qui eodem anno contra Willielmum Rufum Regem Anglorum rebellauit. Sed
paulo post captus, fere 34. annis in carcere praefati Regis, and Henrici
fratris eius sine prole consenuit.

The same Author delivers his marriage thus in another place. Lib. 8. pa. 703.


Robertus vt fines suos vndique dilataret, and ditissimis contubernalibus
affinitate potentum sibi copulatis robustior ardua tentaret; Mathildem
generosam virginem Richerij de Aquila duxit quae neptis erat Hugonis Cestrensis
Comitis ex sorore nomine Judith.

And in the said page, he sets down his character, and the number of the
Lordships which he possessed here in England, with his great power and riches,
thus.

Robertus Rogerij de Molbraio filius potentia diuitijsque admodum pollebat;
audacia et militari feritate superbus pares despiciebat, and superioribus
obtemperare, vana ventositate turgidus, indignum autumabat. Erat autem corpore
magnus, niger et hispidus: audax and dolosus, vultu tristis ac seuerus. Plus
meditari quam loqui studebat, et vix in confabulatione ridebat. Hic nimirum
cclxxx. villas in Anglia possidebat.

This man of this high spirit and ample possessions, became in the end to be a
shorn Monk of this Monastery, as you may read in the Catalogues of Honor;
wherein he died, Ann. 1106. To whose memory a Monk of his order made this
Epitaph. Which he caused to be engraven upon his Monument, upon the North side
of the Vestrie where he was interred.

Vir probus and fortis quem virtus nescia mortis Ex vet. M ss. Anon. in saepe
dict. bib. Cott.

Condecorat, cista iacet hic Robertus in ista;
Cui dat cognomen Moulbraia nobile nomen.
Norhandunbrorum comes fuit; hic Monachorum
Dux erat optatus, prudens, pius, and peramatus:
Hic Monachus fidus, hic Martisin agmine sidus,
Exijt e terris, huius mundi quoque guerris,
Anno milleno Domini centenoque seno
Quarta die Februi. Pax sit eique mihi. Amen.
Here sometimes was interred the body of Alexander Necham, Alex. Necham.
whose knowledge in good Arts made him famous throughout England, France,
Italy, yea and the whole world; and that with such incredible admiration, that
he was called Miraculum ingenij, the wonder and miracle of wit and sapience. He
was an exact Philosopher, an excellent Divine, an accurate Rhetorician, and an
admirable Poet. As did appear by many his writings which he left to
posterity: Cent. 2.
some of which are mentioned by Bale.

He was borne in this Town, Camd. in Heart.
as appears by a certain passage in one of his Latin Poems, cited by Camden,
and thus englished by his Translator Doctor Holland.

This is the place that knowledge took of my nativity,
My happy years, my days also of mirth and iollitie.
This place my childhood trained up in all Arts liberal,
And laid the groundworke of my name, and skill Poetical.
This place great and renowned Clerks into the world has sent:
For Martyr blessed, for nation, for site, all excellent.
A troop here of religious men serve Christ both night and day,
In holy warfare taking pains, duly to watch and pray.
Camden in his Allusions to names, tells us that he, being desirous to enter
into religion in this house, after he had signified his desire, writ thus to
the Abbot Laconically. Si vis, veniam, sin autem, tu autem.
Who answered as briefly, alluding to his name: thus. Si bonus sis, venias, si
nequam, nequaquam.
Whereupon, says he, he changed his name to Neckam.

A Monk of this house made this Hexamiter allusiuely to his name.

Dictus erat Nequam, vitam duxit tamen equam.
He is thought, by some, says Bale, to have been a Canon Regular, and to have
been preferred to the Abbotship of Gloucester: as another in this old language
will have it.

(...) Glocest.
And master Alisander that Chanon was er

But this may be understood of Alexander Theologus, of whom I have spoken
elsewhere, who was contemporarie with him: for I find that this Alexander was
Abbot of Saint Mary's in Circester, or Cirencester. At the time of his death,
which happened about four hundred and thirteen years since.

Now if you be desirous further to know how this Abbey Church has been
honored by the Sepultures of many worthy persons; will it please you peruse
these verses following, by which, both her foundation and fall is plainly
deciphered.

Behold that goodly Fane which ruined now does stand,
(...). Drayton Poly^^. Song 16
To holy Albon built, first Martyr of this Land,
Who in the faith of Christ from Rome to Britain came,
And dying in this place resigned his glorious name.
In memory of whom (as more then half Divine)
Our English Offa reared a rich and sumptuous Shrine;
And Monastery here: which our succeeding Kings,
From time to time endowed with many goodly things.
And many a Christian Knight was buried here, before
The Norman set his foot upon this conquered shore;
And after those brave spirits in all those balefull stowers,
That with Duke Robert went against the Pagan powers.
And in their countries right, as Cressy those that stood,
And that at Poyters bathed their bilbowes in French blood;
Their valiant Nephews next at Agincourt that fought,
Whereas rebellious France upon her knees was brought.
In this religious house at some of their returns,
When nature claimed her due, here placed their hallowed vrnes:
Which now devouring Time, in his so mighty waste,
Demollishing those walls, has utterly defaced.
So that the earth to feel the ruinous heaps of stones,
That with the burth'nous weight now press their sacred bones,
Forbids this wicked brood, should by her fruits be fed;
As loathing her own womb, that such loose children bred.
But I will come to the quarrel of the houses of York and Lancaster, which
filled up our Ladies Chapel here, with the dead bodies of the Nobility,
slain in and about this Town of Saint Albans; whose funeral Trophies are
wasted with devouring time, and seats or Pewes for the Townsmen made over
their honorable remains. Of these Lords here buried, thus writes the old
Poet, John Gower. Quos mors, quos Martis sors saeua, suaeque sororis
Bella prostrarunt, villae medioque necarunt,
Mors sic occi^sos tumulauerat hic simul ipsos,
Postque necem requiem causauit habere perennem
Et medium sine quo vult hic requiescere nemo;
Hic lis, hic pugna, mors est qui terminat arma,
Mors, sors, and Mauors qui strauerunt Dominos hos.
But amongst so many of the Nobility here interred, I find few remembered,
save Edmund Duke of Somerset, Henry Earl of Northumberland, and John the
valiant old Lord Clifford.

The death of this Edmund Duke of Somerset, Edmund Duke of Somerset.
grandchilde to John of Gaunt, sore grieved King Henry the sixth; because in
him he had always put great trust and confidence: being a chief Commander,
and one who had long governed Normandy, been Regent of France, and for his
countries sake had always right valiantly borne himself against the French.
Yet his actions, whatsoever they were, did not please the common people; nor
many other of rank and quality in those times. For Harding who lived in those
days, thus writ of him. They slew the Duke Edmond, Hard. ca. 234.
then of Somerset,
For cause he had the realms well so let.
He was slain under the sign of the Castle in the Town, being long before
warned (as it is reported) to avoid all Castles.

Henry Lord Percy, Henry Earl of Northumberland.
Earl of Northumberland aforesaid, was the son of Henry, surnamed Hot-spurr,
slain at the battle of Shrewsbury by King Henry the fourth. But his fathers
offense, and his Grandfathers, being forgiven him, he was restored to his
Grandfathers dignities by Henry the fifth, to whom, and to his son Henry the
sixth, he ever continued a loyal subject, stoutly maintaining their right to
the Crown of England; in which quarrel he here lost his life.

The old Lord Clifford here interred, is specially remembered in the battle,
for so valiantly defending and strongly keeping the Barre-yates and entrance in
the Town; ^
insomuch that the Duke of York had ever the repulse, until great Warwick
brake in by a garden side, with a noise of Trumpets and voices, crying, A
Warwick, a Warwick. Whereupon ensued that fierce and cruel battle in which
this valourous old Lord manfully lost his life. Of these two last remembered,
will you read this Stanza. ^
Therle then of Northumberland was there
Of sodein chance drawn forth by the king
And slain unknown by any manne there were
The Lord Clifford over busy in werking
At the Bars them met sore fightyng
Was slain that day upon his own assaute
As each manne said, it was his own defaute.
This battle wherein they were slain, was the first battle at Saint Albans,
which was fought in the year 1455. the Thursday before Pentecost.

John Whethamsted, the fore remembered Abbot, made certain Epitaphs for
religious persons, and others here interred; as also in other Churches
hereabouts. Which for the most part are now either taken away by time, or
stolen away with the brass from their Graue-stones; which, howsoever I know
not well how to appropriate to the Persons for whom they were intended. Yet it
will not be lost labor to take and imprint them out of the Manuscript, ^
for that the Reader may see the rare compositions in that age.

1.
Duplex est vita, duplex mors, corporis vna;
Nominis ^
astch altra, miserorum mors ea dicta.
Non sic hic obijt, non sic hic nunc requiescit,
^mo mors prima fuit illi vita secunda.
Et si quod rapere voluit mors id tribuisse
Fertur, quasque dare tenebras has surripuisse
Estque lucet sic ei lux perpetue requiei.
Atque libro vite quo nunc inscribitur ipse,
Nomen eius legitur and cum sanctis numeratur.
2. Upon a Prior of this house here buried, who was never beloved in his life
time, yet much bewailed after his death.
Quem dens momordit liuoris dummodo vixit,
Linguaque detraxit, mors nunc been glorificauit.
Nunc redeunt varia tumulata prius benefacta;
Famaque recrescit, liuor post facta quiescit.
Nunc acus invidie, lingue fell, serra loquele,
Carpere cessarunt: nunc aicere sic didicerunt.
Quando cadens obijt abijt pater hicque recessit;
Secum dapsilitas secum virtus and honestas.
Istius Ecclesie quasi plangentes abiere.
Secum claustrale frenum que iugum Monachale
Migrarunt eciam; claustro dederantque salutem.
Secum vera fides, bine secumque sorores,
Ibant ad puteum, dixere, locoque tuantem
Secum fertilitas, pietas, secumque facultas,
Que parcit miseris, sua que confert and egenis:
Secum Iusticia, pax, and lex, and policia.
In breuibus quicquia virtutem gignere possit,
Secum transiuit, abijt, secumque recessit
Cur Dominus secum, secum requies in idipsum.
3. Upon a Monk buried in this Church.
Alter honestatis Sol serens and grauitatis,
Hesperus ac morum, lampas rutilans monachorum,
Nunc occultatur; hic sub modio tenebratur.
Nec tribuit lumen Claustro quod tribuit olim;
Mors eclipsari cansauerat and tenebrari:
Est tamen Eclipsis he eius particularis.
Nam sua seu prima nunc vita latet tenebrata,
Altera sic lucet, sic nomen eique resplendet,
Quod per defectum nunquam patietur Eclipsim:
Nam per vim fame stat mortis vulnus inane;
Cur exoretur pro Patre pioque rogetur,
Lux quia vera fuit subiectis dummodo rexit
Semper perpes ei lux luceat, ac requici.
Pausa sit perpetue, vita vinat duplicique,
Nominis, ac anime, sic vinere vult meruitque.
4. Upon a Monk of this Abbey here entombed.
Quem Natura mirum natu fecit generosum,
Grataque sors Dominum, mos atque patrem Monachorum,
Nunc abijt, sed non obijt, quia nomine viuit
Nec recubat, magis astch vigilat, quia fama superstes,
Vestitu Maurus, fuit, in victu Benedictus,
Pacomius monitis, Basilius and rudimentis:
Nec sibi defuerat ipsum decuit quod habere,
Impar nam steterat, and Pater absque pare.
Pro Pastore pecus, plebs pro domino gemit omnis,
Almaque Sponsa flet cecidisse virum.
Astra tamen ciuem letentur habere perhennem,
Exultatque Polus quod sit ei thalamus.
5. Upon a Monk of this house here buried.
Qui lacrimans Lazarum revocasti quadraduanum,
Ad vitam Monachum reuoces sic hic tumulatum.
Fac tecumque frui requie cum luce perhenni:
Vendicat ex iure, vixit Monachaliter ipse.
6. Upon another Brother of the Covent here interred.
Iste Pater, pater iste, pius, Pater hic tumulatus;
Et pater, and matter, Pedagogus eratque minister
Dum rexit, pecorum fuerat, cur quod tribuendum,
Quatuor hijs restat, nunc detur, eique reviuat,
In voto Fratrum quia tot fuit vnus eisdem.
Stoque vices que modos alternauit variantes
Morte premi talem culpat pietas pietatem.
7. Upon John Cressy a young youth, of the ancient family of the Cressyes,
hereby at Harding.
Dum puer ipse fui, puer and libroque vacaui,
Mortis mole rui, moriens hic me sepeliui.
Here Is magnus eram, preclara stirpe que natus;
Dumque superfueram John Cressy rite vocatus.
Qui pretergrederis lege; pro me postque preceris.
8. Upon another young boy, where buried I know not.
Que iuuenes que senes, pueros, que viros premit omnes
Mors sub mole tua, precor, in te, voce sub ista
Sit tibi posse breue; nunquam fatum puerile
Per te mutetur, sit canus cum morietur.
Vi^ vndennis eram morsu cum mortis obibam.
9.
Dum matter plorat, puer hic in morte laborat;
Dumque Petra tegitur rogat vt requies sibi detur.
Vt rogat ipsae sibi sit perpes pax requiei.
Sic nos clamemus, secum pariterque rogemus,
Vt sibi cum requie lux lucescat sine fine.
10. Upon Thomas Pakington slain in the first battle, here in Saint Albans,
who was Sword Bearer to Henry Lord Percy, Earl of Northumberland, here also
slain, as I have said before. He lies buried in Saint Peter's Church in this
Town, with an Epitaph upon a marble-stone, to the same effect.
Me vis prostrauit, me post mortem tumulauit;
Hac sub mole petre; perij, seu sic periere
Tres magni Domini; fueram tunc scutifer vni
Portitor ac gladij: pax sit eique mihi.
Ipse Thomas dictus Pakington eramque vocatus.
11. Upon Margaret Biseworth a Maid.
Qui legis hec memora iacet hic quod femina clara,
Que Margareta fuerat Byesworth vocitata.
Hanc mors seua nimis, etas sibi dum iuuenilis
Infuit, intacto steterat dum corpore Virgo,
Peste sua strauit hic stratam and tumulauit.
M. semel: x querno: C quater, ter and I. sibi iuncto
V. que, die binamartis decies repetita
Transijt a seculo sibi propicius Deus esto.
12. Upon John Dunstable an Astrologian, a Mathematician, a Musician, and what
not.
Musicus hic Michalus alter, nouus and Ptholomeus,
Junior ac Athlas supportans robore celos,
Pausat sub cinere; melior vir de muliere
Nunquam natus erat; vicij quia labe carebat.
Et virtutis opes possedit vnicus omnes.
Cur exoptetur, sic optandoque precetur
Perpetuijs annis celebretur fama Iohannis
Dunstapil; in pace requiescat and hic sine fine.
13. Upon one Peter, buried in the lower part of this Quire.
Petrum petra tegit; qui post obitum sibi legit
Hic in fine chori se sub tellure reponi.
Petra fuit Petrus petree quia condicionis;
Substans and solidus quasi postis relligionis.
Hic sibi sub Petra sit pax and pausa quieta.
14. Upon one Peter Jones, a Doctor, and a Parson, a confabulatorie Epitaph.
Quis iacet hic? Pastor: quis item? graduamine Doctor:
Quod nomen? Petrus: cognomen quale? Johannes:
Annis quot rexit? ter trinis: quot sibi vixit?
Lustra bis septem: Quis finis? sanctus eidem:
Vixit enim sancte, moriens sic desijt atque.
15.
Hic soboles cineris, hic proles and mulieris
Compausant; vtero pariendi rursus ab vno.
Partu puluereo renouatur vitae secundo
Et sub perpetuo mors manet exilio.
In this Manuscript are diverse other Epitaphs of his making, which I shall
meet withal by the way.

I had like to have forgotten Alan Strayler, Alan Strayler.
the Painter or Limmer out of the pictures, in the golden Register, of all the
Benefactours to this Abbey; who for such his pains (howsoever he was well
paid) and for that he forgave three shillings four pence of an old debt owing
unto him for colors; is thus remembered.

Nomen Pictoris Alanus Strayler habetur
Qui sine fine choris celeslibus associetur.
But it is high time to take leave of the Abbey, which at the first (as you may
perceive by the premises) was endowed with much land, and many large
privileges, and daily augmented, and successively confirmed by the charters of
many of our English and Saxon Kings and Princes; and much enlarged in all by
sundry Abbots, and other sincere well-affected persons. So that before the
dissolution such were the privileges of this place, that the King could make
no secular Officer over them but by their own consent^ they were alone quite
from paying that Apostolical custom and (...), which was called ^
Rom-scot or Peter Pence: whereas neither King, Arch^ishop, Bishop, Abbot,
Prior, nor any one in the kingdom was freed from the payment thereof. The
Abbot also (or Monk appointed Archde^con under him) had pontifical
jurisdiction over the Priests and Laymen, of all the possessions belonging to
this Church, so as he yielded sub^^tion to no Archbishop, Bishop, or Legate,
save only to the Pope of (...). This Abbot had the fourth place among the
Abbots, which sat as ^^^ons in the Parliament house. Howsoever Pope Adrian the
fourth, those surname was Breakespeare, borne hereby at Abbots Langley, grant^d
this indulgence to the Abbots of this Monastery; that as Saint Alban was
distinctly known to be the first Martyr of the English Nation: so the ^bbot of
his Monastery should at all times among other Abbots of Eng^^nd, in degree of
dignity, be reputed first and principal. The Abbot and (...) of this house
were acquitted of all Toll through England. They made Justices, ad audiendum
and terminandum, within themselves; and no other Justice could call them for
any matter out of their liberty. They made Bayliffes and Coroners: They had
the execution, and return of all Writs, (...) goods of all out-lawes, with
Jail and Jail delivery within themselves. And received to their own proper
use the Rom-scot (before spoken of) throughout all the County of Hertford. This
Abbey was surrendered up by the Abbot and Monks there; by delivering the Covent
seal into the hands of ^. Pope: D. Peter: Master Cauendish, and other the
Kings visitors, the fifth day of December, 1539. It was valued, at a far
under ^ate, to be worth of yearly revenue, two thousand five hundred and ten
pound, six shillings, penny half penny, q:

Saint Peter's Church in Saint Albans.
This Church and Churchyard was stuffed full with the bodies of such as were
slain in the two battles, ^
fought here at Saint Albans. In which I find a funeral Monument for my
valiant countreyman, Sir Bertin Entwisell, who fighting on the Kings party,
died of a wound received in the first battle. Upon whose Tomb this
Inscription, inlayd in brass, is yet to be read.

Here lyth Sir Bertin Entwisel knight, which was borne in Lancaster Shyre, and
was Vicound and Baron of Brykbeke in Normandy, and Baliffe of Constantin. Who
died the xxviii of May, M.cccc.lv. on whose sowl Jesus have mercy.

Of which Sir Bertin, thus speaks Leland in his Commentaries. There is a
Viscownt of Brykbek in Normandy, says he, called Bertyne, or Berframe
Cnitwesell, that came into England, and was much on the factyon of king Henry
the sixth, and slain at on of the Battles at Saint Albons, and beryed in the
Peroche Church of Saint Peter, under the plase of the Lectorium in the Quyre,
whereas a memorial of him there yet remeyneth. There was a dawghter of this
Viscount called Lucy, of whom Master Bradene of Northamptonshyre is descendyd;
and in the same Shyre is a mean gentylman of that name*

These Entwisells were gentlemen of good respect in our country in our fathers
days, whose mansion house retains the name of Entwisell to this hour: The
last heir of which house (as I have it out of the collections of M. Dalton,
alias Norroy king of Arms) was one Wilfred Entwisell, who sold the land that
was left him, and served as a Lance at Muselborrowfield, in the second year of
the reign of king Edward the sixth; after that he served the Guyes in defense
of Meth. After that he was one of the four Captains of the Fort of Newhauen;
where being infected with the plague, and shipped for England, was landed about
Portsmouth, and being uncertain of any house, died under a hedge, in
September, Ann. 1549.

and Raphe the son, of Bapthorpe in the Eastriding of Yorkshire; which for
many descents has yielded both name and habitation to that knightly family;
fighting in this Town under the banner of King Henry the sixth, lost their
lives, and here lie buried together; with this Epitaph.

Behold where two Raulph Babthorps, both the son and father lie,
Under a stone of marble hard, interred in this mould dry:
To Henry sixth the Father Squire, the son he Sewer was,
Both true to Prince, and for his sake they both their life did pass.
The year one thousand and four hundred fifty five,
Grimme death, yet not alone, did them of breath deprive.

Under a marble stone in the Quire a religious man lies interred, whose name
is worn, or stolen out with the brass; only the form of a Rose remains:
and in the turnings of the leaves this Inscription.

Saint Germans.
About the year of the worlds redemption, Camd. in (...).
429. when as the Pelagian heresy budded forth afresh in this Island, and so
polluted the British Churches, as that to auerre and maintain the truth, they
sent for German, Bishop of Auxerre, the place of his birth (a man of much
noble lygnage, taught and informed well in the Arts liberalle, learned in the
science of the Decretees droytes and law, Iac. de voragine in vit. S. Ger.
says his Legend) and Lupus Bishop of Troies out of France: who by refuting
this heresy, gained unto themselves a reverent account among the Britains. but
chiefly German, who has at this day thorowout all this Island many Churches
dedicated to his memory. Now, understand, that near to the walls of the old
City Verulam, was, as then, a plot of consecrated ground, wherein the bodies
of such as had professed Christianity, and suffered martyrdom under the
persecution of the Roman Emperors, S. Germans the buria^l (...) many (...).
were interred. In which the said German openly (out of the pulpit) preached
Gods word to the people; where afterward the believing Christians built this
Chapel, and dedicated it to his honor; for that by his doctrine, and other
good means, he had converted many thousands to the true profession of
Christian Religion. This German commanded the Sepulcher of Saint Alban to be
opened, and therein bestowed certain relics of Saints, that those whom one
heaven had received, should also be in one Sepulcher together lodged. Camd. in
(...)
Thus much (says Camden) I note by the way, that ye may observe and consider
the fashions of that age. This Chapel, or rather the ruins of it, are
remaining at this day, and put to a profane and beastly use.

The foundations of Sopwell, S. Iulians, and Saint Mary Pree.
About this Town of Saint Albons, the Abbots of the Monastery in a pious and
devout intent erected a little Nunnery at Sopwell, valued but at threescore and
eight pound eight shillings, per annum.

Saint Iulians Spittle for Lepers, and another named Saint Mary de Pree, or
Saint Mary in the Meadow, Ger^mbery.
for diseased weemen. Near unto which they had a great Manor, named
Gorombery: where Sir Nicholas Bacon knight, Lord Keeper of the great Seal of
England, a man of rare wit and deep experience (father of Sir Francis Bacon
knight, Lord Verulam, Viscount Saint Al^an, Lord Chancellor of England, lately
deceased, one that might justly challenge, as his due, all the best attributes
of learning) built an house beseeming his place and calling; and over the
entrance into the Hall caused these verses to be engraven.

Upon the frontispice of a gate, entering into an Orchard with a garden and a
wilderness, over the statue of Orpheus, these verses are depicted.

Redborne.
This Redborne in times past was a place renowned, Amphibalus
and resorted unto, in regard of Amphibalus the Martyrs relics here found.
Who instructed S. Alban in the Christian faith (as I have said before) and for
Christ's sake suffered death under Dioclesian. He was surnamed Deuanius; for
that he was borne upon the river of Dee in Wales, the son of a Prince, says
his Legend. A man (says Bale) both for learning and good life unmatchable,
Bale Cent
preaching (and that with happy success) the glad tidings of the Gospel,
throughout all the parts of Britain. For, to escape the execution of the Edict
of the Emperor, he fled from Verulam (with a great number of such as he had
converted) into the kingdom of Scotland, and into the Isle of Anglesey in
Wales; whereof he was made Bishop, preaching in all places the true and lively
word, disputing and writing against the worshippers of false Gods. But being
afterward apprehended, he was brought to the same place where his Scholar
Saint Alban suffered martyrdom, and whipped about a stake, whereat his
intrailes were tied: so winding his bowels out of his body, was lastly stoned
to death, like another Stephen. For whose body some of the persecuted
Christians got a stolen burial here at Redborne; from whence it was removed
with all celebritie, and enshrined by the relics of (his Scholar) Saint
Alban; in the year of Grace 1178. the 25. day of June. ^
Nullum vnquam tam iucundum tam salutarem diem videt Verulamium (says
Harpsfeeld) occurrebat enim Martyr martyri, Magistro discipulus, hospes H.
spiti, and caelestis cruis conciuicaelesti. The Covent of Saint Albans had such
a care that his relics should be devoutly preserved, that a decree was made
by Thomas then Abbot; that a Prior and three Monks should be appointed for so
sacred an office; for which they were to receive twenty pounds yearly
allowance. Such was the price and estimation in those days, of the bones and
ashes of religious persons, remarkable for their holiness. Cent. 1.
This Amphibalus was a rare Linguist, and a profound Divine for those times. He
writ a book against the errors of the Gentiles, and certain Homilies upon
the four Evangelists, with other learned works mentioned by Bale.

Sir Richard Read knight, lies here entombed. Of whom hereafter, according to
my method.

Mergate.
Near to this Village sometime was a little religious house of Nuns, of
which I never read nor heard further, then by an old petition in rhyme, which
runs by tradition from one traveler to another, as they pass along this
thorrow fare. Upon which I lately happened in a very ancient Manuscript in Sir
Robert Cottons Library: and thus it was delivered in their English: the words
are significant and modest, if you do not misinterpret.

Here are in this Church three wondrous ancient Monuments, whose inscriptions
are quite perished, supposed by the Inhabitants to have been made for certain
Noblemen, Lords of this Manor. Which may very well be true, by these words of
our grand Antiquarie Master Camden.

Somewhat above (says he) Flamsted shows it self upon the hill, which in
the time of King Edward the Confessor, Leosstane the Abbot of Saint Albans
gave unto three Knights, Turnot, Waldefe, and Turman, for to defend and secure
the country thereby against thieves. But William the Conqueror took it from
them, and gave it to Roger Todeney, or Tony, a noble Norman, whose possession
it was, but by a daughter it was transferred at length to the Beauchamps,
Earls of Warwick.

Berkamsted.
In the body of this Church stands a stately Tomb, of an antique rich
fabric, strangely depainted, whereon the shape of a man in knightly
habiliments, with his wife lying by him, are cut in Alabaster, and about the
verge of a large marble thereunto adjoining, this Inscription engraven in
brass.

Ric. Torington, and Marg. his wife.
Hic iacet Richardus Torynton and Margareta vxor eius, qui quidem Richardus

This Torynton, as I have it by relation, was the founder of this Church, a man
in special favor with Edmond Plantaginet, Duke of Cornwall; who was son of
Richard Plantaginet, second son of king John, Earl of Cornwall, and king of
the Romans. Which Richard full of honors and years, ended his life here at
his Castle of Berkamsted, but was buried at his Abbey of Hales. Of whom
hereafter.

Here are diverse Tombs to the memory of the name of Waterhouse, whose
inscriptions of antiquity are all taken away with the brass, and the careful
preserving of the rest altogether neglected.

This John Incent Doctor of the Law, was Deane of Saint Paul's London, who
built in this Town a free-Schoole, allowing to the Master a stipend of twenty
pound per annum. And to the Usher ten pound, which was confirmed by Act of
Parliament.

Here is an ancient monument to the memory of one John Raven Esquire, Io. Raven.
who died in the year 1395.

Under the Arms of King Edward the sixth, painted upon a table, these verses.

Ingenio nulli, nullus in art prior:
Edwardi insignis sunt haec insignia? Iudi^.

Kings Langley.
So named of the Kings house thereunto adjoining, wherein Edmund Plantaginet,
Foundation (...).
the fifth son of King Edward the third, was borne; and thereupon surnamed
Edmund of Langley. Hereby was a religious House for preaching Friars, founded
by Roger the son of Robert Hell, an English Baron, Edmund Planginet Duke of
York, Isabell his wife.
valued to be yearly worth at the suppression, one hundred and fifty pound
fourteen shillings eight pence; in the Church of this monastery the foresaid
Edmund was interred. He was Lord of Tindale, Earl of Cambridge, and Duke of
York. He married Isabell, second daughter and one of the heirs of Peter, King
of Castile and Leon, who died before him in the year 1393, and was buried in
this Friery; by whom he had issue Edward Earl of Rutland, Duke of Albamarle
and York; Richard Earl of Cambridge, and a daughter, whose name was
Constance. He had a second wife whose name was Ioane, daughter of Thomas
Holland, Earl of Kent; who after his death was married to William Lord
Willoughby of Eresby, to Henry Lord Scroope, and to Henry Bromflet, Lord Vescy.
He is reckoned for one of the Knights of the Garter, and in the absence of his
father in France, is said to be Protector of the Realm of England. He is
much commended for his affability and gentle deportment, as also for his
valor; of which will you hear my often alleged Author, Io. Harding.

Cup 182* 18.4
Sir Edmond Langley full of gentylnesse:
Sir Thomas Woodstok full of courage.
For his valor in another Chapter thus.

And his brother Edmond then faught full sore:

That better faught upon a feld before.
It was but grace that they escaped thore.
They put theimselfes so fer forth ay in prees
That wounded were they both full sore, no lees.
This renowned Duke deceased (says Stow) in the year 1402. the third of Henry
the fourth, and was here buried near to his wife, with two of his brethren,
who died young.

Pierce Gaueston Fade of Cornwall.
Here sometime lay entombed the body of Pierce Gaueston (a Gascoigne borne) Lord
of the Isle of Man, and Earl of Cornwall. A man in such favor with Edward the
second (having before ensnared his youth by the allurements of a corrupt life)
that he had from the said King whatsoever could be poured upon him. For though
it might seem incredible (says Speed out of the book of Dunstable) he both
gave him his Jewels and ancestors treasure, and even the Crown it self of his
victorious father: not sticking to profess (if it lay in him) he should
succeed him in the kingdom. But his insolency, and presumption upon the kings
favor, made him so far to forget himself, as that he scorned the best of
the Nobility, as much as they hated him: miscalling and giving them scoffs,
with bitter jests; which left behind them a sour remembrance, and the sting
of revenge. Of all which my old timer who flourished about those days, thus
speaks more seriously in Prose. Rob. Glocest.


Perys went into the kyngys Tresorye in ye Abbey of Westminstre (says he) and
yer took away a tabil of gold with the tressel, and other
oyer rich Iuwels, the which were sumtym king Arthurys: and hem he took to a
merchant yat het Aymery of Friscomband, and bar hem over the sea into
Gascoigne, and yay were never brought again, yat was great harm to yet Reme. And
this Sure Perys greatly despysyd the Lordys of ye land, and at yat tym Sure
Perys called.
clupyd Robard of Clare ye Earl of Gloucetre Hoar sone and ye Earl of Penbrok,
Joseph ye Jew, and ye Earl of Lincoln.
Nycol, Sure Henry de Lacy Brokbely, and Guy*
Gowy of Warwike Blak hound of Ardern, and also he clupyd ye nobi^ and gentyl
Earl of Lancastre earl or chu^le.
Eherle, and oyer meny despytes he s^yd to ye Lordys of England wherefore yay
weryn sore agreuyd. And so much agrieued they were, that they surprised him in
the night at a viliage or manor called Dathington, or Deddington, between
Oxford and Warwick, from whence Guy Earl of Warwick took him to his Castle of
Warwick, where in a place called Blacklow (afterward Gaueshead) his head was
stricken off the nineteenth of June, 1311. at the commandment and in the
presence of the Earls of Lancaster, Warwick, and Hereford, as of one that had
been a subuerter of the Laws, and an open Traitor to the kingdom. A violent
and unadvised part of these Lords, to put to death an Earl so dearly loved of
the King, without any judicial proceeding by trial of his Peers: which
caused a lasting hatred betwixt the King and his Nobles, and was the beginning
of the second civil war of England. Some two years after this Tragedy,
King Edward caused the body of his Gaueston to be transferred, with great
pomp, from the place of his former burial (which was among the Friars
Preachers at Oxford) to this Friery of his own foundation (says Stow.) Where
he in person with the Archbishop of Canterbury, four Bishops, many Abbots, and
principal Churchmen did honor the Exequies, but few were present of the
Nobility; whose great stomachs would not give them leave to attend. This was
the end of that fatal great Favorite Gaueston, who, for that he was the
first Priuado (says Sam. Danyel in the life of Ed. the second) of this kind
ever noted in our History, and was above a King in his life, deserves to have
his character among Princes being dead. Which is thus delivered.

Native he was of Gascoine, Pierce Gaueston described.
by birth a Gentlman; and for the great service his father had done to this
Crown, entertained and bred up by king Edward the first, in company with his
son this Prince, which was the means that invested him into that high favor
of his; He was of a goodly personage, of an haughty and vndauntable spirit,
brave and hardy at Arms, as he showed himself in that Turneament which he
held at Wallingford, wherein he challenged the best of the Nobility, and is
said to have foiled them all; which inflamed the more their malice toward him.
In Ireland where he was Lieutenant, during the short time of his banishment, he
made a journey into the mountains of Dublin; brake and subdued the Rebels
there, built Newcastle in the Kernes country, repaired castle Keuin, and after
passed up into Munster and Thomond, performing every where great service with
much valor and worthiness: He seems to have been a Courtier, which could
not fawn nor stoop to those he loved not, or put on any disguise upon his
Nature to temporize with his enemies. But presuming upon his fortune (the
misfortune of such men) grew in the end to that arrogancy as was intolerable;
which the priuacie of a Kings favor usually begets in their Minions; ^
whose understanding and judgment being dazed therewith, as is their sight,
who stand and look down from off high places, never discern the ground from
whence they ascended. And this extraordinary favor showed to one, though he
were the best of men, when it arises to an excess, is like the predomination
of one humor alone in the body, which endangers the health of the whole, and
especially if it light upon unworthiness, or where is no desert; and commonly
Princes raise men rather for appetite, then merit: for that in the one they
show the freedom of their power, in the other they may seem but to pay their
debt. This old Latin rhyme was made in those days, upon the death of this
Gaueston: by a Monk of S. Mary's York. ^
Dum Petrus seuit propriam mortem sibi neuit
Nunc patet vt nevit, truncatus ense quieuit.
Besides his honors before remembered, he was Protector or Guardian of the
Realm, during the Kings abode in France, about his marriage with Isabell, the
daughter of Philip the fair French King; which indeed was an office but of
eighteen days continuance, as appears by the sequel.

anciently descended from the Longs of Wilshire, and father he was to John Long
of Holme Hall, in the County of Derby gentleman; who was father to George Long
Esquire, now living, Clerk of the office of Pleas in his Majesty's Court of
Exchequer, and one of his Majesty's Justices of Peace within the County of
Midlesex. He lived after he was made free of London (which was in the eleventh

In the South wall of this Church the proportion of two weemen lie cut in
stone, who (as I have it by relation) were two Sisters here entombed, the
builders of this Church, and coheires to this Lordship, which at their deaths
gave the said Lordship to the Abbey and Covent of Westminster.

Here is now the seat of that right honorable Lord, Sir Edward Carey, knight,
Baron of Falkland, lately Lord Deputy of Ireland. Some of which family lie
here fairly entombed.

South Mimmes.
A seat of a worshipful family of the Coningesbies, says Camden, descended
to them by Frowick, from the Knolles, ancient possessors thereof. In the
Belfrey of this Church is a goodly marble stone inlay'd all over with brass,
under which one of the Frowicks lies interred. A gentleman who made his
recreations for the good of his neighbors, as appears by his Epitaph,
composed by John Wethamsted, Abbot of S. Albans aforesaid.

Standon.
In the Quire of this Church lies entombed the body of Sir Raph Sadleir, Sir
Raph Sadleir knight Banneret.
the last knight Banneret of England; priuye Counselor to three Princes. A man
so advanced (says Camden) for his great Services and stayed wisdom. He was
brought up under politic great Cromwell, Earl of Essex (as appears by the
prose and verse engraven upon his Monument) who, when he came to man's estate,
employed him as his Secretary. But Henry the eight conceived so good an opinion
of his discreet comportement, and ingenious pregnancie, that he took him from
the service of the said Cromwell about the twenty and sixth year of his
reign, made him his principal Secretary; and used his advice in matters of
greatest trust and importance, especially in the affairs and passages betwixt
the two Realms of England and Scotland. He continued his love toward him to
the end of his life; and for the special trust and confidence he had in his
approved wisdom and fidelity, together with the Earl of Arundell, the Earl
of Essex, and others, he made choice of him for the ayding and assisting of the
Executors of his last Will and Testament; by which his last Will (the copy
whereof I have in my custody) he gave him two hundred pounds as a Legacy.

In the first of Edward the sixth he was chosen Treasurer for the Army sent
into Scotland, under the conduct of Edward Duke of Somerset, Protector, and
John Earl of Warwick; where, in the battle of Musselborrow, he showed great
manhood and prowess.

His great diligence, says Hollinshead, in bringing the scattered troops into
order, and ready forwardness in the fray, did worthily merit no small
commendacions; After which Battle he with Sir Francis Brian, Captain of the
light horsemen, and Sir Raph Vane, Captain of all the horsemen, were honored
for their valiant good service, with the dignity of Knights Bannerets.

In the tenth year of the reign of Queen Elisabeth he was preferred, and
advanced by her, to the Chancellourship of the Duchy of Lancaster. But his
honors and offices are most succinctly engraven upon his goodly Tomb, in
these Hexameters. Radulphus Sadlier titulum sortitus Equestrem,

His son and heir Sir Thomas Sadleir knight, lies interred by him (of whom
in another place, for I have already come nearer to these times then I
determined) the father of Raph Sadleir Esquire, that bountiful good
Housekeeper now living, Ann. 1630.

Near unto the fair builded mansion house of the said Raph Sadleir some time
stood a little religious fabric of Austine Friars, but by whom founded, or
how endowed, I do not find. It was a cell to the Priory of Clare in Suffolk,
some part of which cell is standing at this day.

This Inscription here engraven to the memory of such a remarkable man, being
Squire for the Body to three such potent Princes, Ensign or Penon-bearer to
one, and Master of the Horse to Ioane, the second wife of King Henry the
fourth, gives me occasion to speak somewhat in particular of these his honors
and offices. And first in general of the signification and Etymology of the
name of Esquire.

Next in degree after knights (says Camden in his treatise of Degrees of
States in England) are Esquires, termed in Latin Armigeri, that is, Costrels,
or Bearers of Arms, the same that Scutiferi, that is, Shield-bearers, and
Homines ad arma, Men at Arms: the Goths called them Schilpor, all, of
carrying the Shield: as in old time among the Romans, such as were named
Scularij, who took that name either of the Escutcheons of Arms which they
bare as Ensigns of their descent, or because they were Armour-bearers to
Princes, or to the better sort of Nobility. Ranulph Earl of Chester, gives
Viello Armigero suo tenementum in Bruhello, Cart. Ranul. Com. cestrie.
to Viell his Esquire a Tenement in Bruhell. And so Archbishops, Bishops,
Barons, knights, and huiusmodi Magnates, Flesa. lib. 1. ca. 27.
and such sort of Peers of the kingdom had their Esquiers.

In times past every knight had two of these waiting upon him: they carried his
Morion and Shield; as inseparable companions they stuck close unto him,
because of the said knight their Lord, they held certain Lands in Escuage,
like as the knight himself of the king by Knights service.

The old Gaulish knights (says Seldom) sat at their round table attended by
their Esquires. Tit. of Honor. Par. 2. ca. 10.


The Germans called an Esquire Schild-knapa, or Shield-knaue, or knave, a
denotation of no ill quality in those days. For here note by the way, that
Johannes de Temporibus, John of the Times (so called for the sundry times or
ages he lived) was Shield-knaue unto the Emperor Charles the Great. Of whom he
also was made knight, as Verstegan affirms in his Treatise of Honor and
Offices.

The Interpreter out of Hotoman, Io. Cowell. Dec. l. C. lit. E.
says that these which the French men call Escuiers, we Esquiers, were a
military kind of vassal, having ius Scuti, which is as much to say, as that
they bare a Shield, and in it the Ensigns of their Family, in token of their
gentility or dignity.

But these Esquires, Five sorts of Esquires.
of whom I have already spoken, be now no more in any request; five distinct
sorts are only remaining of these at this day.

The principal Esquires are accounted those that are select Esquires for the
Princes body, and such a one was Perient here interred Inter Armigeros qui
f^unt non nascuntur Primarij habentur quatuor illi Armigeri ad corpus Regis:
Glossar. lit. ^.
Amongst Esquires which are made so by their offices (not so borne) those four
Esquires to the kings body are chief and princiall, says Sir H. Spelman. The
next unto them be knights eldest sons: and such an Esquire was the knights
son in Chaucer, who attended his father on pilgrimage to Thomas Beckets
Shrine, as does appear by their characters in the Prologues to the Canterbury
tales. Of which so much as tends to this purpose.

A Knight there was, and that a worthy man,
That fro the time that he first began
To riden out, he loved cheualrie,
Troth, honor, freedom, and courtesy.
-- he was late come fro his voyage,
And went for to done his pilgrimage.
With him there was his son a young squire,
A lover, and a lusty Bachelere:
With his locks crull as they were laid in press,
Of twenty year of age he was as I guess.
Curteys he was lowly and servisable,
And kerste before his Fader at the table.
In a third place are reputed younger sons of the eldest sons of Barons,
and of other Nobles in higher estate; and when such heirs males fail,
together with them also the title fails.

In a fourth rank are reckoned those, unto whom the King himself, together
with a title, gives Arms, or creates Esquires, by putting about their neck
a silver collar of ^
S S, and (in former times) upon their heels a pair of white spurs
siluered: whereupon at this day in the West parts of the kingdom, they be
called White-spurres, for distinction from knights, who are wont to wear gilt
spurs: and to the first-begotten sons only of these does the title belong.

In the fifth and last place be those ranged, and taken for Esquires; whosoever
have any superior public Office in the common weal, or serve the Prince in
any worshipful calling.

But this name of Esquire, which in ancient time was a name of charge and
office only, crept first among other titles of dignity and worship (so far
as I could ever observe, says Camden) in the reign of Richard the second.

In ancient deeds we find little mention made of gentlemen or Esquires, but
since the time of Henry the fourth these additions to names have been usually
inserted in writings, by reason of the Statute of the first of Henry the fifth,
cap. 5. that in all cases wherein Process of Outlary lies, additions shall be
made of the estate, degree, or Mystery of which the parties sued are.

This Perient is here styled also Penerarius, Ric. secundi, because (as I
conjecture) he had the carriage of the Kings Penon. Which word signifies a
Banner or Ensign carried in war; or a little Streamer worn on the top of a
lawnce by a Horseman. A word borrowed from France: for Penon in French
signifies the same thing.

Cowell. (...).
Master of the Horse (which office this deceased Gentleman enjoyed under the
Queen as aforesaid) is he that has the rule and charge of the Kings or
Queens stable, being an office of high account.

The ^rierie.
Here adjoining to the Town was a Priory of white Friars Carmelites, founded by
king Edward the second, John Blomvill, Adam Rouse, and John Cobham: and
dedicated to the Honor of our alone Savior, and the blessed Virgin; valued
in the Kings books upon the surrender thereof (which was upon the ninth of May,
Ann. 26. Hen. 8.) but at 4. l. 9. s. 4. d.

Kinesburne or Kinesbourgh.
Here lies the carcass of an old Castle interred in her own ruins; which in
former times gave entertainment to certain obnoxious persons, which called
themselves the kings loyal good Subjects; and the chief preseruers of his
peace throughout all the adjacent countries: Mss in bib. cou*
as it is in the golden Register of S. Albans, as follows.

Stephanus Rex ad petitionem Abbatis Roberti, and ob honorem Albani Martyr is
permisit dirui castrum de Kynesbury, vbi antiquis temporibus latebant quidam
Regales nequam homines Abbathie nimis infesti, and damnosi, dicentes se Regis
esse fideles, et custodes pacis patrie, cum potius pacem and patriam
perturbarent.

King Stephen at the request of Robert Abbot of Saint Albans, and for the
honor he bore to the holy Martyr S. Alban, gave commission for the pulling
down of the Castle of Kinesbury; wherein in ancient times, certain imperious
wicked persons, wondrous much offensive and malicious to the Abbey, took up
their privy lodgings; saying that they were the Kings faithful servants, and
keepers of the peace of the country; when as to the contrary they rather
overthrew and disquieted all peaceable government, and the whole country.

wife to king Henry the first, passing over the river of Ley at Ouldford,
hardly escaped danger of drowning: after which she gave order that a little
beneath, at Stretford, there should be a bridge made over the water; going over
which toward West Ham, I saw the remains of a Monastery, pleasantly watered
about with several streams, which William Montfichet (a Lord of great name of
the Norman race) built, in the year of our Lord, 1140. The revenues of this
house were much augmented and confirmed by king Richard the second, in the
tenth year of his reign, as by his charter amongst the Records in the Tower
appears. Dedicated it was to the honor of Christ, and Mary his blessed
mother, replenished with black Monks. And valued at the suppression to be

Diverse other beside the founder endowed this religious Structure. Some of
whose donations I find to be confirmed by the said William Montfichet in this

The Baronie or habitation of this family de Monte Fixo, or Montfichet, was
Stansted in this County, from whom the Town is called Stansted Montfichet to
this day. They were reputed men of very great Nobility; until that their
ample inheritance was divided among three Sisters. One of which progeny,
namely Richard, was in the reigns of king John and Henry the third famous for
his high prowess and chivalry: Three the most forcible and valiant knights of
England (says Stow) in those days were Robert Fitz-water, Robert Fitz Roger,
and Rich. Mont-Fichet.

October 1527.

For the word Sewar, says Minshew, I have heard of an old French book
containing the Officers of the king of Englands Court, as it was anciently
governed, that he whom in Court we now call Sewar, was called Asseour, which
comes from the French Asseoir, to set, setle, or place, wherein his Office in
setting down the meat is well expressed.

Or Sewar, says he, is derived perhaps from the French word Esquire, id est, a
Squire, because he goes before the meat as a Squire or Gentleman Usher. The
Fees allowed to this Officer in the reign of Queen Elizabeth (as I have it
out of a general collection of all the Offices of England in her days) was
thirty and three pounds thirteen shillings four pence.

One of the Ancestors of this Bruin, (as I have it out of a book of the
visitation of Essex in the Heralds office) was Chamberlain to King Edward the
first, who gave him the Manor of Bekingham in Kent, who married ^sold, the
sole heir of this Manor of south Okenden, who served Q. Elianor, wife to the
said King Edward, which gave to them diverse Lordships in Hampshire. (...) ^ssex.
This Family of Bruin, says Camden, was in former ages, as famous as any one
in this tract. Out of the two heirs female whereof, being many times married
to sundry husbands, Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, the Tirels, Berners,
Harlestons, Heueninghams, are descended, and of that house there be males yet
remaining in Southamptonshire.

Coringham.

The Monuments in this Church, (which have been many) are quite defaced. I read
in an old Manuscript, thus much of the Baudes there buried, and in other places
sometimes Lords of the Town, and Patrons of the Church.

Anno 1500. Men's. Iunij obijt Dominus Thomas Bawd miles, obijt apud London,

Anno 1550. obijt Johannes Baud Ar. apud Coringham.

This ancient family of the Bawdes, Stow says, as he had read out of an
ancient deed, gave unto the Deane and Chapter of Paul's, upon the day of the
conversion of Saint Paul, a good Do; and upon the feast of the commemoration
of Saint Paul, a fat Bucke; in consideration of twenty two Acres of land, by
them granted, within their Manor of Westley in Essex, to be enclosed into
their Park of Coringham. Sir William Baud about the third of Edward the first,
was the first that granted this deed, which was confirmed by his son Walter,
and others of his line.

This Bucke and Do were brought upon the said festival days, at the hours
of Procession, S^ru^y in Far^^g ward (...).
and through the Procession to the high Altar; the manner of it is reported by
Stow, who partly (as he says) saw it, thus.

On the feast day of the commemoration of Saint Paul, the Bucke being brought
up to the steps of the high Altar in Paul's Church, at the hour of Procession,
the Deane and Chapter being apparelled in Coapes and Vestments, with Garlands
of Roses on their heads, A Bucks head borne before the Procession at Paul's.
they sent the body of the Bucke to baking, and had the head fixed on a Pole,
borne before the Cross in their Procession, until they issued out of the West
door; where the Keeper that brought it, blowed the death of the Bucke, and then
the Horners that were about the City, presently answered him in like manner.
For the which pains, they had each man of the Deane and Chapter, four pence
in money, and their dinner, and the Keeper that brought it, was allowed, during
his abode there for that service, meat, drink and lodging, at the Deane and
Chapters charges, and five shillings in money, at his going away, together with
a loaf of bread, having the picture of Saint Paul upon it, etc.

There was belonging to the Church of Saint Paul, for both the days, two
special Suits of Vestments, the one embrodered with Buckes, the other with
Does, both given by the said Bauds.

Baud is the surname (says Verstegan) of a worshipful family in England, In
our name^ of contempt.
and of a Marquess in Germany, anciently written Bade, and the letter D used
of our Ancestors in composition, as th: so the right name is Bathe, and so this
family (might be) took the name of some office belonging to the Bathe, at the
time of the Coronation of some King, when as the Knights of the Bathe are wont
to be made.

Ralegh.
Here is a monument in this Church which makes a show of great antiquity, but
who should be therein entombed, I could not certainly learn; some of the
Inhabitants say, that one of the ancient house of the Alens, other say, that it
was made for one of the family of the Essexes, who were Lords of this town,
and noble Barons of England, both before and since the Conquest: Swein de
Essex, the son of Robert, who was the son of Winmarke, Baron of Ralegh,
built the ruined Castle in this town, in the reign of Edward the Confessor,
whom the King calls Brother, in this his Charter to Ranulph Peperking.

make a firm bargain: but to return from whence I have digressed.

Ryding from Ralegh toward Rochford, I happened to have the good company of a
gentleman of this country, (...) Court.
who, by the way, showed me a little hill, which he called the Kings Hill; and
told me of a strange customarie Court, and of long continuance, there yearly
kept, the next Wednesday after Michaelmas day, in the night, upon the first
cockcrowing without any kind of light, save such as the heavens will affoard:
The Steward of the Court writes only with coals, and calls all such as are
bound to appear, with as low a voice as possibly he may; giving no notice
when he goes to execute his office. Howsoever he that gives not an answer is
deeply amerced; which servile attendance (said he) was imposed at the first,
upon certain Tenants of diverse Manors hereabouts, for conspiring in this
place, at such an unseasonable time, to raise a commotion. The title of the
Entry of the Court, he had in memory, and writ it down for me when we came
to Rochford. Thus it runs in obscure barbarous rimes.

Curia de Domino Rege dicta sine Lege,
Tenta est ibidem per eiusdem cons^etudinem.
Anteortum solis luceat nisi polus:
Seneschallus solus scribit nisi colis.
Clamat clam pro Rege; in Curia sine lege.
Et qui non cito venerit citius penitebit.
Si venerit cum lumine, errat in regimine,
Et dum sunt sine lumine capti sunt in crimine.
Curia sine cura iurata de iniuria
Tenta die Mercurij prox. post festum Sancti Michaelis.
Thus much have I spoken of a Lawless Court, for which I have neither law nor
reason. For I am sure that this discourse is impertinent, and quite from the
subject to which I have tied my self to treat of. Yet I hope these lines will
not seem much unpleasing for my Reader to peruse, when his mind is
ouercharged with dull, heavy, and uncomfortable Epitaphs.

Rochford.
I am looking for some Monument or other in this Church, to the memory of some
one of the Lords of ancient Nobility, to which this Town gave the Surname of
Rochford (as now it gives the title of Viscount Rochford to that truly
honorable and right worthy gentleman Henry Carry, Lord Hunsden, and Earl of
Dover.

The Tower and the Steeple of this Church was built from the ground, as the
inhabitants by tradition affirm, by Richard, Lord Rich, Baron of Leez, and
Chancellor of England. A most prudent and judicious Statesman, a singular
treasure and supporter of the kingdom: who for his great good deserts received
the office of Chancellor of England at the hands of King Edward the sixth.
Camden.
Howsoever the Arms of the Butlers, Earls of Ormond (whose inheritance this
Town was in times past) are cut in some places on the stone.

Hospital at Rochford.
Robert Lord Rich, and Earl of Warwick, lately deceased, founded here six
Alms houses, for five poor impotent men, and an aged woman.

But here let me conclude what I have spoken of this town, with the words of
Camden.

More inward (says he) is Rochford placed, that has given name to this
Hundred; Camd. in Essex.
now it belongs to the (now Earls of Warwick) Barons Rich, and in old time
it had Lords of great nobility, surnamed thereof; whose inheritance came at
length to Butler, Earl of Ormond and Wiltshire, and from them to Sir Thomas
Bullen, whom King Henry the eight created Viscount Rochford, and afterward
Earl of Wiltshire; out of whose progeny sprung that most gracious Queen
Elizabeth, and the Barons of Hunsdon.

Pritlewell.
Foundation of the Priory.
Swein de Essex (before remembered) built here a Priory for black Monks, which
he dedicated to the blessed Virgin Mary. Which was much augmented by others,
and holden to be a cell to the Priory of Jews: until the year 1518. when as
a great contention arose between the two Houses: insomuch that John Prior de
Pritlewel noluit soluere vnam Marcam Priori de Jews nomine subiectionis. Lib.

now grown out of use by reason of Osith the virgin of royal parentage; who
being wholly devoted to the service of God, was here stabbed to death by the
Danish pirates, in the year 653 in the month of October. Io. Cap^raue.
And being by our Ancestors honored for a Saint, Richard de Beaveyes Bishop
of London, in her memorial, built here a religious house, of Regular Chanons,
about the year 1120. in the reign of King Henry the first. His grant I have
read in the Records of the Tower, Cart. Antiq, lit.
beginning thus. Richardus Dei gratia London Episcopus, etc. Salutem. Sciatis
quod ego dedi Ecclesie Sancte Osithe virginis de Ciz. ecclesias de Sudemenestra
et de Clachentona cum omnibus que ad illas pertinent, etc. King Henry confirms
and augments this donation by his Charter dated at Roan in the nineteenth year
of his reign. And many others so added to the revenues of this Monastery, that
at the time of the suppression, it was valued at 758. pound, five shillings
eight pence. This Bishop, the founder, was diverse times about to resign his
Bishopric, that he might become a regular Canon in this his own new built
Monastery; and that the rather, because being taken with an irrecouerable
Palsy, Godwin. de Prefisl. Angl.
he well knew his time to be short. But he so long deferred the execution of
this intent, that he was surprised by death before he could perform it, the
sixteenth day of January, 1127. He was Warden of the marches of Wales, and
governor of the County of Salop, he sat Bishop twenty years, in which time
(beside the building of this Monastery) he purchased diverse whole streets, and
much housing near to his Cathedral Church of Saint Paul's. All which he pulled
down, and leaving the ground unbuilt for a Cemitery or Churchyard, enclosed
the same with a wall, which for the most part remains; but at this day so
covered with houses, as it can hardly be seen. The Canons of this house
desired his body to be here buried: which they entombed under a marble Monument
with this inscription.

Woodham waters.
In this Church I find no monument of any great antiquity, howsoever here was
the ancient seat of the Lords Fitz-waters, who being nobly descended (says
Camden) were of a most ancient race, Camd in Essex

Maldon.
Kimbaline, King of Britain.
In this town stood the palace royal of Cunobeline or Kimbaline, King of
great Britain, a Prince that spent his younger years in the wars, under
Augustus Caesar, of whom he received the order of Knighthood, by whom he was so
favored, Camd. in Essex.

without the payment of Roman Tribute, who having for a long time enjoyed
peace, in the universal peace of the world, (for in the xiii. year of his

the God of peace our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, was borne of the blessed
Virgin.) He trained up his people in a more civil and peaceable kind of
government, then that to which they had been formerly accustomed, Stow Annal
and departed this world in peace, within this his City of Maldon, then the
chamber of his kingdom; in the one and twentieth year of our redemption, when

Diverse other fair monuments (but shamefully defaced) are here erected to the
memory of the Darcies, a numerous family, and for antiquity and nobleness of
birth, of great respect in many places of this kingdom.

Sir Robert Darcy Knight, remembered in the former inscription, by his last will
and testament, bequeathed his body to be buried in this Church; the substance
whereof I have read in an old Manuscript, In bib. Cot.
as follows.

Robert Darcy Knight, made his Testament, the 5 of October, Anno Domini, Sir
Robert Darcies Will Ex Regist Episcopi Lon^^. Tho. Kem^.
1469. his body he willed to be buried in all Hallowes Church of Maldon, before
the Altar, in the Isle, where his father lies in a Tomb of marble. Also he
willed l* marks to be disposed for two thousand masses for him to be said,
within six weeks next after his deceyse, iiii. d. for every mass; and that
they be charged for to prey for his soul, his wifs soul, his fathers and his
mothers, and for all his sisters souls; and for all their husbands souls, and
for all the souls that he is bound to prey for. Of which said l. marks, he
willed to have somewhat every Prist that dwelled in Penbroke hall in Cambridge.
Also he willed that every Friar that was a Prist in Colchester, have xx. d. and
every little Friar vi. d. to say three dirgees, considering that he was a
brother of that Order. And the house of Chennesford xl. s. the house of Clare
xx. s. and each young Friar vi. d. considering that he was a brother of their
Order. And he made his Executors, Elizabeth his wife, Io. Clopton Esquire,
Nicolas Saxton, and Richard Astley, Clerks. And the superuisors of this his
Testament, my Lord of Essex, my Lord Dinham, Thomas Mountgomery, and Thomas
Tirrill Knights; lowly beseeching the said Lord of Essex, the Lord Dinham, Sir
Thomas Mountgomery, and Sir Thomas Tirrill, to help his son Thomas and all
his children. Also he willed that my Lord of Essex, and the Lord Dinham,
should each of them have a But of Malmesey, and that Sir Thomas Mountgomery,
and Sir Thomas Tirrill should each of them have a pipe of red wine. Also he
willed that his brother John Clopton, one of his Executors, should have for his
labor xx.l. Also he willed mistress Anne Darcy his brothers wife, to have xx.
marks. Yeuen at Danbury the day and year above said. This his will was
proved, quarto di^ mensis Maij, coram reuerendo in Christo Patre Domino Thoma

Foundation of the white ^^iers.
Here in this town sometime stood a religious house of Carmelites or white
Friars, founded by Richard de Grauesend, Bishop of London, and one Richard
Iselham a Priest, about the year 1292. valued at the suppression at twenty
six pounds, eight shillings: a poor Foundation for so great a Prelate, having
the assistance and charitable contribution of another Priest.

The Maldon.
This little covent was honored with diverse great scholars, which I find to
have been therein buried: and first Thomas Maldon, so called of this town,
the place of his birth, brought up of a boy in this house of the Carmelites;
from whence he went to Cambridge, when he attained to ripeness of years,
where he profited exceedingly in all kinds of learning; in so much that he was
chosen to be the chief master or professor of Divinity in that University; he
was, says Pits, de illustribus Anglie scriptoribus, from whom Bale does not
much dissent, subtilis disputator, elegans co^cionator, in omni concertatione
scholastica promptus et expeditus, in dubiis explicandis clarus et dilucidus,
in decernendis et diffiniendis rebus arduis constans et solidus.

He was called from Cambridge to take upon him the government of this Priorie;
in which office he ended his days, in the year 1404. and was interred in the
Church of his Covent; upon whose Tomb this Epitaph was engraven, as I have it
in a Manuscript.

grauestone.

Within this City and the suburbs are contained ten Parish Churches; in all
which I could collect no more Inscriptions of any antiquity, save these in
Saint Gyles Church. But howsoever her Churches at this day be no ways
beautified with the ancient funeral Trophies of any illustrious personages;
yet her inhabitants may brag of the burial of Coill, that brave British
Prince, who built this their Town of Colchester, about one hundred twenty and
four years after the birth of our Savior Christ. Wherein his son Lucius,
Helena, and Constantine, the first Christian King, Empress, and Emperor in
the world, were borne: which made Necham (says Speed) for Constantine to sing
as he did. Speed in Essex.


From Colchester there rose a Star,
The Rays whereof gave glorious light
Throughout the world, in climates far;
Great Constantine Romes Emperor bright.
This Coilus was brought up even from his youth in Rome, and therefore
favoring the Romans, paid them his tribute. He reigned fifty five years
says Stow. Harding says but eleven. In whose commendations will it please you
hear himself speak. (...) Annal.


Coell ruled the Realm in Law and peaceful well
That for his wit and vertuosite
^
Able he was as Chronycles could feel,
To have ruled all the Emperalyte
For right wesnesse, manhood, and moralyte,
A daughter had he, and none other heir,
Elyne that hight, far passing good and fair.
Buried at Care colune he was his own cytee
Greatly commended, well famed, and laudifee,
Both on this side and beyond the Sea
Eleven year regnyd in great dignitee.

Without the walls of this Town, The foundation of S. John's.
stood a large and stately Monastery, which Eudo Sewar to king Henry the first,
founded and consecrated to the honor of Christ and Saint John Baptist, wherein
he placed black Monks. The Ancestors of the right honorable Sir Edward
Sackvile, knight of the Bath, and Earl of Dorset, were great benefactours, or
rather cofounders of this religious structure. For in the book of the Abbey of
Colchester I have read, In Lib. Colt. Jordan and Robert Sackvile.
that Iordanus de Saukevil miles et Baro de Bergholt Saukevil, filius and here is
Roberti Saukevil, superstes tempore Stephani Regis, and Henrici secundi
confirmavit Ecclesie Sancti Iohannis de Colecestria in perpetuam Eleemosinam,

donauerat.

The foresaid Eudo founded likewise in this Town an Hospital for people
infected with the contagious disease of Leprosy, Foundation of the Hospital
for Lep^^s.
which he dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalen.

Here was another religious house wherein were placed brethren of the holy
Cross, Foundation of the Friery of the holy Cross
but by whom founded I cannot find. Valued at the suppression to 7. l. 7.5.8.

Robert Lord Fitzwater in the year 1309. Foundation of the Minories.
founded here an Abbey for Friars Minors, into whose order and House he entered
himself in the year 1325. and then and there took upon him the habit of a
religious Votary, wherein he spent the rest of his days, In bib. Cott.
Ann. M.ccc.ix. (says the book of Dunmow) Robertus filius Walteri custos de
Essex fundamentum posuit Ecclesie Fratrum Minorum de Colcestria. And in the
Catalogue of such Emperors, Kings, Princes, and other potent personages, which
from the beginning have entered into this religious order. This Robert is
reckoned for one. These are the words.

This house was valued at the suppression at 113. l. 12. s 8. d. of yearly
revenues.

Earls Colne.
So called of the Sepulture of the Earls of Oxford, Camd. in Oxford.
which derive their descent (says Camden) from the Earls of Guines in France,
and have the surname of Vere from Vere a Town in Zeland. In this parish Church
are two Monuments of this family of the Veres, the one lies crosse-legd, with
a Sarasins head upon his tomb, which Sarasin (say the Inhabitants) this Earl
slew in the holy Land. The other of them with his wife, lies entombed; at her
feet is the Talbot, at his feet the Boar: they are both shamefully defaced.
They were removed out of the Priory near adioining at the suppression, as I
was told.

This Priorie was first founded by Aubrey de Vere soon after the Conquest, The
foundation of Colne Prio^ie.
which he dedicated to the honor of God and Saint Andrew; and placed therein
black Monks, translated from Abingdon, to which Abbey he made this Priory to be
subject upon this occasion, In Rib. Cott.
as I have it out of the book of Abingdon.

Godfrey de Vere the son and heir of the foresaid Aubrey by Beatrice his
wife, dying in his fathers life time, was buried in the Monastery of Abingdon,
to which he had been a benefactor, whereupon, says the Story, Aubrey his
father and Beatrice his mother were determined to choose Abingdon for their
burial place, in respect of the tender affection they bore to their child. But
their Lands lying here in Essex far off, they procured a Grant from King
Henry the first to build a religious House at Colne in Essex, for their souls
health, their Sons, and others, as also for their Sepultures; et hanc domum
Sancto Andr^e Apostolo dedicatam, subiectam et coher^ntem Ecclesie Abingdonen
si faciebant. Not long after the finishing of this work, and a little before
his death, Aubrey the Founder took upon him the habit of Religion in this his
own house, wherein he died, and was here buried by a younger son of his,
named William, in whose remembrance this Epitaph was engraven upon their
Monument.

Cedunt a vita votis animisque cupita, Aubrey de Vere and William his son.

Barbarus, et Scita, Gentilis, et lsraelita:
Has pariter metas habet omnis sexus et et aes,
En puer, en senior, Pater alter, filius alter,

Non iuvenie ^ote quas epotavit Athene
Non v^tulo vote vires velopes valuere.
Sed valuere fides, et predia quae memoramus.
Vt valiant, valiant per secula cuncta precamus.
M^^. in bib. Co^*
For the said Aubrey de Vere and Beatrice his wife, I found this Inscription to
be engraven upon their Monument, in the book of Colne Priory.

Here lies Aulbery de Veer, the first Earl of Guisnes, the son of Alphonsus
de Veer, the which Aulbery was the fownder of this place, and Bettrys his wife
sister of king Wylliam the Conqueror.

This Priorie was valued at the fatal overthrow of such like buildings to be
yearly worth 175. l. 14. s. 8* d ob. The house is standing at this day,
converted into a private dwelling place, as also the old Chapel to it,
wherein are diverse Monuments, under which lie buried many of this thrice
honorable Family of the Veres, but they are all gone to decay, and their
Inscriptions by time and stealth quite taken away. Upon one Tomb of Alabaster
which is thought to be the ancientest, is the pourtraiture of a man lying in
his armor, crosse-legged, but what was carved at his feet cannot be discerned.
Upon another, is one lying armed wtih the blew Bore under his head, which was
also crosse-legged, as I was informed; but now is nothing remaining from the
middle downward. A third of wood armed crosse-legged, on his Target the Arms
of the house of Oxford; and there lies by him a woman made of wood, which is
thought to have been his Lady, and Countess. Here are two more likewise in
wood armed, and crosse-legged, the one has an Hound or Talbot under his feet:
the cote Armor of the other is quite broken away with his Target. Here is one
in Alabaster not crosse-legged, the Garter about one of his legs; what is
under his feet cannot be discerned. A woman pourtrayed in Alabaster with a
Falcon under her feet, and a little Monument of Alabaster, upon which is the
image of one in a Gown, with a purse hanging at his girdle: he is in length
about four foot. But I will show the Reader the names of such Earls and
others of this house which by supposition and certainty are said to have been
here interred; which may give some light to the further knowledge of these, in
this manner intombed.

Aubrey de Vere the son of Aubrey, Aubrey de Vere the first Earl of Oxford,
surnamed the grimme.
Chamberlain under King Henry the first, or Camerarius Anglie, as I find it
in old Cartularies, having lost this his Office of great Chamberlain, and
other dignities, in the turmoiles between King Stephen and Maude the Empress,
was by the said Empress and Henry the second (as you may have it more fully in
Vincents discovery of errors) restored to all his former honors, and withal
created Earl of Oxford. He died in the year 1194. the sixth of king Richard
the first, and was here buried by his father. Lib. Alb. de Colne.
His wife Agnes or Adeliza lies buried by him, who was the daughter of Henry
of Essex, Baron of Ralegh, the Kings Constable.

Such was the Epitaph or inscription upon his Tomb, as it is in the book of
Colne Priory. Aubrey de Vere the second Earl of Oxford.


Hic iacet Albericus de Vere, silius Alberici de Veer, Comes de Guisney and
primus Comes Oxonie magnus Camerarius Anglie qui propter summam audatiam, and
effrenatam prauitatem Grymme Aubrey vocabatur, obiit 26. die Decembris, anno
Christi, 1194. Richardi ^. sexto.

Aubrey de Vere, the son of the foresaid Aubrey, succeeded his father in all
his dignities; I find little written of him in our Histories, save that out of
his Christian piety he did confirm the gift of septem librat. terre which
Aubrey his father gave to the Chanons of Saint O since here in Essex, adding
thereto something of his own. He dyed in the year of our Lord, 1214. and
sleeps now in the same Bed, with three other Aubreyes his Ancestors. To whom
this Epitaph upon Conrad the Emperor at Spires in Germany may be fitly applied.

Filius hic, Pater hic, Auus hic, Proauus iacet istie.
The great Belsire, the Grandsire, Sire, and Son
Lie here interred under this Grauestone.
Hugh de Vere the son of Robert the first of that Christian name, Hugh de
Vere Earl of Oxford.
Earl of Oxford, and Lord great Chamberlain of England, was here entombed
with his Ancestors, who died in the year 1263. He had the title of Lord
Bolebeck, which came by his mother Isabell de Bolebeck, daughter and heir of
Hugh de Bolebeck, a Baron, who was Lord of Bolebeck Castle in Whitechurch
within Buckinghamshire, and of Swaffam Bolebeck in Cambridgeshire. He had to
wife Hawisia the daughter of Saier de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, as appears
by this Inscription sometime insculpt upon their Tomb.

Hic iacent Hugo de Veer eius nominis primus: Comes Oxonie quartus, magnus
Camerarius Anglie, filius and here is Roberti Comitis, and Hawisua vxor cius,
filia Saeri de Quincy comitis Wintonie, qui quidem Hugo obiit 1263. Quorum
animabus propitietur altissimus.

Robert de Vere (...) of Oxford.
Robert de Vere, the son of Hugh aforesaid, Earl of Oxford, who enjoyed his
fathers inheritances and honors the space of thirty and two years, lies
here entombed with his ancestors: who died in the year 1295. Alice his wife,
the daughter and heir of Gilbert Lord Samford, Lord of Hormead in
Hertfordshire was interred by him, who died at Caufeld house near Dunmow, the
ninth day of September, 1312.

Robert de Vere the son of Robert Earl of Oxford.
Here lies buried the body of Robert de Vere, son and successor to the
foresaid Robert, whose government both in peace and war was so prudent, his
hospitality and other works of charity so wisely abundant; and his
Temperance with a religious zeal so admirablie conjoined, that he was of all
surnamed the good Earl of Oxford; and the vulgar esteemed him as a Saint. He
died the 19. of April, 1331.

Robert de Vere Earl of Oxford, and Duke of Ireland
Here lies entombed Robert de Vere, Richard the seconds Mignion; who to add to
his honors created him Marquess of Dublin, a title not known before that
time in England, and in the year following Duke of Ireland, with commission to
execute most inseparable prerogatives royal. These Styles were of too high a
nature, and therefore infinitely subjected to envy. Whereupon, like a second
Gaueston, he was hated of the Nobility; especially for that he was a man nec
prudentia, caeteris proceribus, nec armis valentior, as Walsingham says, 9. R.
2. But it was not long before he was banished England by the Barons, for
abusing the Kings ear to the hurt of the State. He had to wife a young, fair,
and noble Lady, and the Kings near kinswoman (for she was grandchilde to King
Edward by his daughter Isabell) he put her away, and took one of Queen Annes
women, a Bohemian of base birth, Sellarij filia, says Walsingham, a Sadlers
daughter, some say a Ioyners, an act full of wickedness and indignity. Yet
this intolerable villainy offered to the bloud-royall, Speed in vita R. 2.
King Richard did not encounter, neither had the power, some say, who deemed
that by witchcrafts and forceries (practiced upon him by one of the Dukes
followers) his judgment was so seduced and captiuated, that he could not see
what was honest or si^ to do. But where Princes are wilful or slothful, and
their Favorites flatterers or time-seruers, there needs no other enchantments
to infatuate, yea and ruinate the greatest Monarch. Upon his banishment he went
into France, where he lived about five years, and there being a hunting, he
was slain by a wild Boar, in the year 1392. King Richard hearing thereof,
out of his love, caused his body to be brought into England, and to be
apparrelled in Princely ornaments and robes, and put about his neck a chain of
gold, and Rings upon his fingers, and so was buried in this Priory; the King
being there present, and wearing blackes.

Aubrey de Vere Earl of Oxford.
After the death of Robert Duke of Ireland, who died without issue, his Nephew
Aubrey de Vere succeeded him in the Earldom of Oxford; he enjoyed his honors
not passing eight years, but dyed die Veneris in festo Sancti Georgij, Ann.
primo Hen. quarti, 1400. and lies here entombed with his worthy Ancestors.

John de Vere Earl of Oxford.
Here lies buried in this Priorie John de Vere, the third of that Christian
name, and the thirteenth Earl of Oxford, Lord Bolebecke, Samford, and Scales,
great Chamberlain, and Lord high Admiral of England. Who died the fourth of
Henry the eight, 1512. having been Earl of Oxford full fifty years; a long
time to tugge out, in the troublesome reigns of so many kings, especially for
men of eminent places and high spirits, ever apt to take any occasion to show
their manly prowess: which fire of honor flamed in this Earls breast, at
Barnet field, where (in a mist) the great Earl of Warwickes men, not able to
distinguish betwixt the Sun with streams upon King Edwards livery, and the
Star with streams on this Earls livery, shot at this Earls followers; and
by that misprision the battle was lost. After which he fled into Cornwall, and
seized upon Saint Michaels Mount. But Edward the fourth got him in his power,
and committed him prisoner to the Castle of Hames beyond the Seas, where he
remained for the space of twelve years, until the first of King Henry the
seventh, with whom he came into England, and by whom he was made Captain of
the Archers at Bosworth-field, where after a short resistance he discomfited
the Foreward of King Richard, whereof a great number were slain in the chase,
and no small number fell under the victors sword. This Earl gave a great
contribution to the finishing of Saint Mary's Church in Cambridge; His
hospitality, and the great port he carried here in his country, may be
gathered out of a discourse, in that exquisite History of Henry the seventh,
penned by that learned and judicious Statesman, Sir Francis Bacon, Viscount
Saint Alban, lately deceased.

The last Earl that I find to be here entombed of ancient times, Io de Vere
E. of Oxford.
is John de Vere, the fourth of that christian name, Earl of Oxford, Lord
Bulbeck Samford and Scales, Lord great Chamberlain of England, and Knight of
the Garter; he was commonly called little John of Camps, Castle Camps, in
Cambridgeshire, being the ancient seat of the Veres, where this Earl used
much to reside; He married Anne, daughter of Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolk,
and died without issue the 14 of July, 1526.

I find in a book of Dunmow, Maud, Countess of Oxford
in bib. Cot. that Maud, the wife of John de Vere the seventh Earl of Oxford,
lies here intombed: she was the daughter of Bartholomew, Lord Badelismere,
Baron of Leedes in Kent; and one of the heirs of Giles Lord Badelismere her
brother. She was first married to Robert, son of Robert Fitz-Paine. She
outliued her later husband some few years, and died the 24. of May, 1365.

... Coggeshall.
....... Coggeshale...... mil..... M. ccc...... For which of the name, this
broken inscription should be engraven, I cannot learn; but I find that these
Coggeshals in foregoing ages, were Gentlemen of exemplarie regard and knightly
degree, whose ancient habitation was in this Town; one of which family was
knighted by King Edward the third, the same day that he created Edward his
eldest son Earl of Chester, and Duke of Cornwall, Anno 1336.

Foundation of Coggeshall Abbey. (...) in bib. Cott
Here in this town of Cogshal was sometime an Abbey built, and endowed by King
Stephen, and Maud his Queen, in the year 1140. the fifth of his reign,
according to the book of Saint Austins in Canterbury, Anno M. c. xl. facta est
Abbathia de Cogeshal a Rege Stephano et Matilde Regina, qui primo fundauerunt
Abbathiam de Furnesse, Abbatiam de Longeleyrs, et postea Abbathiam de
Feuersham, etc. this house was dedicated to the blessed Virgin Mary, wherein
were placed white Monks ^luniackes; the revenues of which were valued to be
yearly worth 298. l. 8. s. it was surrendered the 18. of March, 29. Hen. 8.

Adjoining to the Rode called Coccill-way, which to this town leads, was
lately found an arched Vault of brick, and therein a burning lamp of glass
covered with a Roman Tyle some 14 inches square, and one Vrne with ashes and
bones, besides two sacrificing dishes of smooth and pollished red earth, having
the bottom of one of them with fair Roman letters inscribed, COCCILLI.M. I
may probably conjecture this to have been the sepulchrall monument of the Lord
of this town, who lived about the time of Antoninus Pius, (as by the coin
there likewise found appears) the affinity between his and the now towns
name being almost one and the same. These remain in the custody of that
judicious great Statesman Sir Richard Weston Knight, Baron Weston of Nealand,
Lord Treasurer of England, and of the most honorable Order of the Garter
companion. Who for his approved virtues and industry, both under father and
son, does to the public good fully answer the place and dignity.

Before these times, in a place called Westfield, three quarters of a mile
distant from this town, and belonging to the Abbey there, was found by
touching of a plough, Camd. in Essex
a great brazen pot: The ploughmen supposing to have been hid treasure, sent
for the Abbot of Cogeshall to see the taking up of it; and he going thither,
met with Sir Clement Harleston, and desired him also to accompany him thither.
The mouth of the pot was closed with a white substance, like past or clay, as
hard as burned brick: when that by force was removed, there was found within
it another pot, but that was of earth; that being opened, there was found in it
a lesser pot of earth, of the quantity of a gallon, covered with a matter like
Velvet, and fastened at the mouth with a silk lace; in it they found some
whole bones, and many pieces of small bones wrapped up in fine silk, of fresh
color, which the Abbot took for the relics of some Saints, and laid up in
his Vestuary.

Bocking Dorewards.
So denominated of the Dorewardes sometimes Lords of this town, and Patrons of
this fat Parsonage, which is xxxv.l. x. s. in the Kings books* as I am
persuaded by relation, and these Inscriptions upon ancient Tombs.

Haulsteed.
The Lordship of Stansteed within this Parish, was the ancient inheritance of
the noble family of the Bourchiers, in which they had a mansion house; many of
which surname, lie here entombed; to continue whose remembrance in the south
side of the Quire is a Chapel, which to this day is called Bowsers Chapel,
wherein they lie interred; the inscriptions which were upon their monuments,
are quite gone, this one following excepted.

Under another of these monuments, lies the body of Robert Bourchier, Lord
Chancellor of England, in the fourteenth year of King Edward the third, from
whom (says the light of great Britain, Clarentie^x) sprang a most honorable
progeny of Earls, and Barons of that name.

death of this Sir Geffray, was forfeited to the Crown, by the attaindour of
Sir John Gate Knight, beheaded on the Tower hill, with John Dudley Duke of
Northumberland, and Sir Thomas Palmer Knight, for that they had endeavored to
have made Lady Jane, (the daughter of Henry Gray, Duke of Suffolk, by Frances

Io. Vere Earl of Oxford.
Here lies interred under a Tomb of marble and Tuch now ruinous, John de Vere
the fifth of that Christian name, Earl of Oxford, Lord Bulbeck, Samford and
Scales, and great Chamberlain of England. Upon which monument I find nothing
engraven, but the names of his children which he had by his wife Elizabeth,
daughter and heir of Edward Trussell of Staffordshire knight Banneret. Which
were three sons and three daughters, namely, John de Vere, the sixth of that
Christian name, Earl of Oxford; In the Catalogue of honor.

In a parchment Roll without date, The foundation of a Priorie in Heueningham.
belonging to the Earl of Oxford, I find that one Lucia (belike some one of
that right honorable house) founded a Priory in this Parish for black veyled
Nuns: Which she dedicated to the holy Gross, and the blessed Virgin Mary.
Of which religious foundation she her self was the first Prioresse: whose
death was wondrously lamented by Agnes, who did next succeed her in that
office, and the rest of the Covent: who desire the prayers and suffrages of all
the religious houses in England, for her souls health. The form whereof to
transcribe, cannot seem much impertinent to the subject I have in hand, nor
tedious to the judicious Reader.

In this Parish Church sometime stood a Tomb, arched over, and engraven to the
likeness of Hawks flying in a wood, which was raised to the remembrance of
Sir John Hawkewood knight, Sir Io. Hawkewood knight.
borne in this village, the son of Gilbert Hawkewood Tanner, bound an
apprentice to a Tailor in the City of London; Stow Annal.
from whence he was pressed in the service of King Edward the third, in the
wars of France. Of whom for his admired valor, he was honored with the
order of knighthood; and in the like regard of his notable demerits, Barnabie
the warlicke brother of Galeasius, Lord of Millaine (father to John the first,
Duke of Millaine) gave him his daughter Domnia in marriage: by whom he had a
son named John, borne in Italy, made knight, and naturalized in the seventh
year of King Hon. the fourth; as I have it out of a Manuscript in these words.

This Town was famous in times past, (says Clarentieux) for a Castle of the
Magnauilles (which now is almost all vanished out of sight) and an Abbey
adjoining, The foundation of Walden Abbey.
founded in a place very commodious, in the year 1136. wherein the
Magnauilles, founders thereof, were buried. The principal and first founder
hereof, was Geffrey Magnauile, or Mandeuill the first Earl of Essex, with
Rohesia or Rose his wife, daughter of Aubrey de Vere, chief Justice of
England, who consecrated this their religious Structure to the honor of God,
the blessed Virgin Mary, and Saint James the Apostle, endowed it with large
revenues, and placed therein black Monks; to which effect will it please you
read a few words out of his deed of Grant.

In Arch. Tu^r. (...).
Gaufridus de Mandeuilla comes Essex, etc. salutem. Ad vniuersitatis vesire
noticiam volo peruenire me fundasse quoddam monasterium in vsus Monachorum apud
Waldenam, in honor Dei, et sancte Marie et beati Iacobi Apostoti, pro salute
anime me et omnium parentum, antecessorum and successsorum meorum, etc. To
which by the same deed he gives the Churches of Walden, Waltham, Estrene,
Sabridgworth, Thorley and others. This house was valued at the suppression, to
be yearly worth, four hundred six pounds, fifteen shillings and eleven
pence.

This place is now called Audley End, of Sir Thomas Audley Lord Chancelour, (of
whom I have spoken before) who changed the Abbey into his own dwelling house;
whose sole daughter and heir Margaret, was second wife to Thomas Howard Duke
of Norfolk, and mother of Thomas Lord Howard of Walden, Earl of Suffolk,
lately deceased, who lived to finish here a most magnificent building,
belonging at this present to that worthy gentleman Theophilus his son and
heir, Lord Walden and Earl of Suffolk.

Geffrey de Mandeuill the founder aforesaid, a man both mighty and martial,
was shot into the head with an arrow, a quodam pedite vilissimo, says Houeden,
out of the Castle of Burwell in Cambridgeshire; of which wound, after certain
days he died, being at that time excommunicated. Lying at the point of death,
ready to give his last gasp, Camd. in (...)
(says Camden out of the Register book of Walden) there came by chance
certain Knights Templars, who laid upon him the habit of their religious
profession, signed with a red cross, and afterward when he was full dead,
taking him up with them, enclosed him within a coffin of lead, and hung him
upon a tree in the Orchard of the old Temple at London, in the year 1144. for
in a reverend awe of the Church, they durst not bury him, because he died
excommunicated, so fearful in those days was the sentence of
excommunication: a violent inuader he was of other men's lands, and possessions,
and therefore justly incurred (says the same Author) the worlds censure, and
this heavy doom of the Church: but I must leave him, where buried, or where
not buried, God knows.

As the Church of this monastery was honored with the funeral monuments of
the Mandeuills, so was it with those of the Bohuns, Earls of Hereford and
Essex, of which you may read in the Catalogues of Nobility.

It was also honored with the Sepulture of Humfrey Plantaginet, Earl of
Buckingham, ^
(the only son of Thomas Earl of Buckingham, and Duke of Gloucester,
commonly called Thomas of Woodstocke, the youngest son of King Edward the
third) who (after the untimely death of his father) was banished into Ireland
by King Richard the second, and being recalled backed again by King Henry the
fourth, in the first year of his reign, in his return died of the plague in
Chester, from whence, his mother Elianor daughter and coheire of Humfrey de
Bohun Earl of Hereford, Essex, and Northampton, caused his body to be conveyed
to this Abbey, which she sumptuously here interred, amongst his and her noble
progenitors; his mother, the said Elianor, lived not long after him, but died
the third of October in the same year, as in a French Inscription upon her
monument in Westminster you may read; and scarce two years after the murder
of her husband at Callis; of whose deaths thus writes that old Poet Sir John
Gower Knight, in his book entitled Vox Clamantis.

Interea transit moriens nec in orb remansit,
Humfredus dictus redit ille Deo benedictus.
Defuncto nato cito post de fine beato
Matter transiuit, dum nati funera sciuit.
Primo decessit The Duke of Gloucester, because the Swan was his cognizance.
Cignus dolor under repressit:
Matrem cum pullo sibi mors nec parcit in ullo.
Liston.
Hic iacet..... Liston de Ouerhal.... que ob....

All that I can make of this maimed inscription is, that Ioane, the wife of
William Liston, held the Manor of Ouerhall in this parish by grand Sergeantie,
namely by the service of paying for, Abstract (...) An 41. Ed. 3.
bringing in, and placing of five Wafers before the King, as he sits at dinner
upon the day of his coronation: and whether this be she here buried or not I
know not.

Richard Lions held the said Manor after her, An ^ Rich. 2.
by the service of making Wafers, upon the day of the Kings Coronation, and of
serving the King with the same Wafers as he sits at dinner the same day.

Leez Abbey.
This Abbey of old time was founded by the Gernons; now it is the seat of the
Right Honorable, Leez Abbey.
and one right worthy of all his due honors, Robert Lord Rich, Baron Leez, and
Earl of Warwick now living, An. 1631. This Abbey or Priory, was valued at the
time of the suppression, as it is in the catalogue of Religious houses, to be
yearly worth one hundred forty one pound, fourteen shillings eight pence.

Mayor of London, named Large, who at his death bestowed wondrous largely upon
the poor, and the repairing of high ways; which I take to have been Robert
Large, Mayor of London, Anno 1440. who gave 120. l. to poor prisoners, and
every year for five year, 403. Shirts and Smockes, 40. pair of Sheets, and
one hundred and fifty Gowns of good Frize, to poor people. To poor Maids
marriages, one hundred marks; to repairing high ways, one hundred marks; to
five hundred poor people in London, every one six shillings viii.d. the rest
of his bountiful charity you may read in Stow Suruay.

Will. Bourchier (...), Earl of Ewe.
Here is a goodly Tomb of marble on the north side of the Chancell, under which
says Brook, in his Catalogue of Nobility, William Bourchier Earl of Ewe in
Normandy lies interred; but Vincent, (whom I rather believe) (in his discovery
of Brooks Errors) approues this Earl, as also his wife Anne (the daughter of
Thomas of Woodstocke Duke of Gloucester) to be buried in the Abbey of Lanthonie
by Gloucester. If this monument could speak like others by her inscription, it
might happily decide the controversy: but all the words upon it are, Fili Dei
miserere mei, Matter Dei miserere mei. Which seemingly comes by a labell from
a man, and a woman thereupon pourtraied. Of this Earl more when I come to
Lanthony.

Between the Chancell and the Bowsers Isle or Chapel, Hen. Bourchier E. of
Essex.
is a very costly arched Tomb of polished marble, inlaid with brass, the
picture of a man and a woman, and in diverse places of the foresaid Arch, on the
woman's side, is the Fetter lock and Bowsers knot, but without inscription. By
supposition made to the memory of Henry Bourchier (son of William Bourchier
aforesaid, Earl of Essex and Ewe; and Isabell his wife, daughter of Richard
Earl of Cambridge, and sister of Richard Duke of York. Which Henry died
quarto Aprilis, 1483. a valiant and worthy Nobleman he was, fortunate in
Martial enterprises; and in matters of peace so learned, wise, and politic,
that he was thought fit by Edward the fourth to be Lord Chancellor of England.

In the same Chapel, Hen. Bourchier E. of Essex.
on the North side, remains a very fair Altar Tomb of marble, within the
which lies the body of Henry Lord Bourchier and Louaine, and Earl of Essex,
Son and heir of William Bourchier, that died before his father, and
grandchilde to Henry Earl of Essex, next before mentioned: over his Tomb
hangs as yet part of his achieuements, as the cote of his Arms, Helm,
Crest, and sword. This Earl brake his neck by a fall from his horse, the
twelfth day of March, in the one and thirtieth year of the reign of King
Henry the eight, 1539. His horse was young, says Stow, Stow Annal.
and he the oldest Earl in England: for if you will reckon the years from the
death of his Grandfather, who lived after his son, the father of this Henry
(as I have said before) until the year of this his fatal misfortune, you
shall find them to be fifty six; and what age he was at his Grandfathers
death you may imagine:

In the Hall of the Manor house of Newton, Out of certain ancient collections
in Essex.
in the Parish of little Dunmowe, remains in old painting two postures; the
one for an ancestor of the Bourchiers, combatant with another, being a Pagan
king, for the truth of Christ; whom the said Englishman overcame, and in memory
thereof his descendants have ever since borne the head of the said Infidel, as
also used the surname of Bourchier or Bowser.

Here are four wondrous ancient Monuments of the Louaines, all the
Inscriptions of them are worn out, these few words excepted.

Sire Thomas Louaine ici gist Margarie la file Moun.... Sir Tho. Lovaine knight.
This noble family of the Lovaines in former ages did here inhabit, by the
name of Fitz-Gilbert, Camd. in Essex
one of which house, namely, Maurice Fitz-Gilbert, was surnamed de Louaine, as
descended from Godfrey of Louaine, brother to Henry the sixth of that name,
Duke of Brabant. Who being sent hither to keep the honor of Eye his posterity
flourished among the Peers of this Realm, to the time of Edward the third:
when the heir general was married to the house of Bourchier.

This Bowsers Chapel (for it is so commonly called) is now the burial place
for the noble family of the Maynards.

Robert Northburnt.
In Northburne natus Robertus sum vocitatus,
De terra factus in terram sumque redactus:
Intercedendo spiritum tibi Christ comendo.
In the window
Propitietur Deus Benefactoribus omnibus Ecclesie pauperis huius.

The treble Bell in the steeple of this Church is called the Bowsers Bell, on
which is cast a piece of coin of silver, of King Edward the fourth; it was
given by one of the Countesses of Essex, as one may partly gather by an old
Inscription; upon it is the Bowsers knot.

Tiltey.
The foundation of Tiltey Abbey.
Here sometime stood a Monastery founded by Maurice Fitz-Gilbert, before
remembered, not long after the Conquest, which he dedicated to the honor of the
Virgin Mary, and therein placed white Monks of the Cistertian order.

The donations to this religious house are confirmed in the Records of the
Tower, Cart. Antiq. lit. S.

The valuation of it at the suppression was 177. l. 9: s. 4. d.

This Monastery is not altogether ruinous, in the little Church whereof I
found these Funeral Inscriptions following.

So called (says Camden) of a broad spread Oak, in which Town Robert de Vere,

valued at the suppression at 157. l. 3. s. 2. d. ob. per annum: which Priory
Aubrey de Vere (the third of that Christian name, Earl of Oxford) enfeoffed
with the Tithes of this Town, and to the instrument of his donation, he
affixed, by a harp string (as a labell to the bottom of the parchment) a
short black hafted knife, like unto an old half penny whitle, instead of a
Seal. These are the words in his Grant.

his perambulation of Kent, page 318.

This Robert was first entombed in the Church of his own foundation, and at
the dissolution removed into the Quire of this Parish Church, where he lies
crosse-legged, with this inscription now almost worn out.

Bishop of London, to dedicate the Church to the honor of the virgin Mary, to
which, the same day, she gave half a Hide of land. Her son and heir Geffrey
Baynard placed black Chanons therein, by the consent of Anselme Archbishop of
Canterbury. This house was valued at the suppression to be yearly worth 173.

Matilda surnamed the fair.
The Church of this monastery is as yet standing, in the Quire whereof, between
two pillars, lies the body of Matilda the fair entombed, who was the daughter
of Robert Fitz-water, the most valiant knight of England. About the year 1213.
says the book of Dunmow, there arose a great discord betwixt king John and
his Barons, because of Matilda surnamed the fair, daughter of Robert
Fitz-water, whom the King unlawfully loved, but could not obtain her, nor her
fathers consent thereunto. Whereupon, and for other like causes, ensued war
through the whole Realm. The king banished the said Fitz-water amongst other,
and caused his Castle, called Baynard, and other his houses to be spoiled.
Which being done, he sent a messenger unto Matilda the fair, Ex predict. lib
Dunmow.

about his old Suit in Love, Et quia noluit consentire toxicauit eam. And
because she would not agree to his wicked motion, the messenger poisoned a
boiled, or potched Egg, against she was hungry, and gave it unto her, whereof
she died, the year 1213.

In the year following after her death, her banished father was restored to
the kings favor, upon this occasion. It happened in the year 1214. king John
being then in France, Stow. Annal.
with a great army, that a truce was taken betwixt the two Kings of England
and France, for the term of five years: and a river or arm of the Sea, being
betwixt either host, there was a knight in the English host, that cried to them
of the other side, willing some one of their knights, to come and just a course
or two with him. Whereupon without stay Robert Fitz-water, being on the French
part, made himself ready, ferried over, and got on horseback, and showed
himself ready to the face of his challenger, whom at the first course, he
stroke so hard with his great spear, that horse and man fell to the ground;
and when his Spear was broken, he went back again to the king of France.
Which king John seeing, by Gods tooth, quoth he, (such was his usual oath) he
were a King indeed, that had such a knight. The friends of Robert hearing these
his words, kneeled down, and said, O king he is your knight, it is Robert
Fitz-water; Sir Rob. Fitz-water knight.
whereupon the next day he was sent for, and restored to the kings favor. By
which means peace was concluded, and he received his livings, and had license
to repair his Castle of Baynard, and all his other Castles. After which, this
strenuous knight, this Mars of men, this Marshall of Gods Army and holy Church
(for so he was enstiled, by the common multitude) lived in all affluence of
riches and honor, the space of sixteen years; deceased in the year 1234.
and lies here entombed by his daughter. Thus says the book, Extract. lib.
Dunmow. in saepe dict. bib. Cott.
Ann. 1234. Obijt nobilis vir Robertus filius Walteri Patronus Ecclesie Dunmow,
qui tumulatur iuxta maius Altar in suo Monasterio, and succedit Walterus
filius eius in heriditatem.

Walter of Clare or Walter Fitz-Robert.
In the midst of the Quire, under a goodly marble stone, lies the body of
Walter, the father of the foresaid Robert Fitz-water, and son of Robert, the
son of Richard, who was the son of Gilbert of Clare. This Walter took to
wife Maud de Bocham, and after her decea^e, Matilda or Maud, the daughter and
coheire of Richard de Lucy, on whom he begat Robert the valiant, before
remembered; he died in the year ^^^8. as I have it in my old Author, Anno vero

qui iacet intumulatus in medio cho^i Ecclesie sue, et succedit Robertus filius
Walteri miles stren^^s.

In the Quire of the Church, Io Blakemore Prior.
under a goodly fair monument, the body of John Blakemore, Prior of this
dissolved house of Dunmow, as I find it in an abstract of the Chronicle of
this monastery, lies interred; for whom this Epitaph following was composed.

His death happened in the year of our saving health, one thousand five
hundred and eighteen, as by the humble petition of the Subprior and his
brethren to their Patron Sir Robert Radcliffe Knight, Radcliffe Patron of the
Priory of little Dunmow.
Lord Fitz-water (afterward Earl of Sussex) for the speedy election of
another Prior may appear, the form whereof, transcribed out of the original,
I thought good here to insert, being a president not commonly known in these
days.

Newton Hall
In the hall of the Manor house of Newton Hall, in this Parish, remains in
old painting, two postures, the one for an Ancestor of the Bourchiers combatant
with another, being a pagan king, for the truth of Christ, whom the said
Englishman overcame, and in memory thereof, his descendants have ever since
borne the head of the said Infidel, as also used the surname of Bowser, as I
had it out of the collections of Augustine Vincent, Windsore Herald, deceased.

Boreham.
The inheritance and honors of this famous, and right noble race of the
Fitz-waters, came at length by marriage into the stock of the Radcliffes, for
(in the pedigree of Sir Alexander Radcliffe of Ordsall in the county of
Lancaster, knight of the Bath; descended, as the Earl of Sussex is, from the
Radcliffes, anciently of Radcliffe in the said County; the son of that
valiant and generally beloved Gentleman, Sir John Radcliffe, Lieuetenant
Colonel, slain, fighting against the French, in the Isle of Rhee, the 29. day
of October, in the year of our Lord, one thousand six hundred, twenty and
seven) I find that Sir John Radcliffe Knight, (son of Sir John Radcliffe
knight, who married Katherine, the daughter and heir of Edward Lord Burnell of
Acton Burnell in the county of Salop) married Elizabeth, the daughter and heir
of Walter, Lord Fitz-water, of Woodham, a Baron of great riches, as of ancient
nobility, the father of John, who was Father of Robert Radcliffe, the first of
that surname, Earl of Sussex, Viscount Fitz-water, Lord Egremont and Burnell,
who with other two Earls, his Son and Grandchilde, lie here interred under a
sumptuous monument, as appears by their several inscriptions and lively
portraitures. To the memory of the first Earl (for I am tied by my method
only to his at this time) these funeral lines following are engraven.

This Earl had three wives, whose portraitures are cut here upon the Tomb, by
all of which he had issue. By his first wife Elizabeth, who was the daughter of
Henry Stafford Duke of Buckingham; he had Henry, after him Earl of Sussex,
here intombed; George Radcliffe, and Sir Humfrey Ratcliffe of Elnestow. By
Margaret his second wife, daughter of Thomas Lord Stanley, Earl of Darby, he
had Anne, married to Thomas Lord Wharton, who lies here buried by her father,
and Jane married to Sir Antony Brown, Knight, Viscount Mountague. By his third
wife, the daughter of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne in Cornwall, Knight; he had
issue, Sir John Radcliffe, Knight, who died without issue, in the year 1566.
and lies buried in Saint Olaues Hart-streete, London.

Henry Radcliffe, Earl of Sussex, son of this Robert as aforesaid, was one
of the privy Council to Queen Mary, as I find it in her Grant of liberty
made unto him for the wearing of Coyfes or Cappes in her presence, which I
coppied out of the Original amongst the Evidences of Robert late Earl of
Sussex deceased; expressed in these words following.

Mary the Queen.
Mary, She took the title of Supremacy upon her in the beginning of her
reign, which she relinquished before her death.
by the grace of God, Queen of England, France, and Irelonde, defendor of the
Feythe, and in Earth, of the Church of England and Irelonde supreme Head. To
all to whom this present writing shall come, sends greting in our Lord
everlasting. Know ye that we do give and pardon to our well-beloved and trusty
Cosen, and one of our priuey Counsel, Henry Earl of Sussex, Viscount
Fitz-water, Lord Egremond and Burnell, liberty, licens and pardon, to were his
Cappe, Coyf, or night Cappe, or two of them at his pleasor, as well in our
presens, as in the presens of any other person or persons within this our
Relme, or any other place of our dominion wheresoever during his life. And
these our lettres shall be his sufficient warrant in this behalf. Yeuen under
our Sign Manuell, at our Palaes of Westminstre the second dey of October, in
the first year of our Reign.

Her Seal with the Garter about it is fixed to this Grant with a labell of
silk, and so are the Arms of the Kings of England: and E. R. the Seal
manuell of Edward the sixth, not altered.

This Henry, departed this life at Sir Henry Sidneyes house in Chanon Row at
Westminster, on wednesday morning, the 17. of February, between five and six
a clock, in the third and fourth year of Philip and Mary, Anno 1556. as
Vincent in his Discovery of Brooks Errors verifieth by a certificate thereof
in the book of Burials in the Office of Arms, Fol. 225.

He was buried first by his Father, in Saint Laurence Poultney Church in
London, from whence their remains were removed hither, as you shall understand
by the present sequel.

That braue-spirited politicke-wise Lord, Thomas Earl of Sussex, Lord
Chamberlain of the Household to Queen Elizabeth of famous memory, built, or
began to build a Chapel in this Church, wherein this glorious Tomb is
erected, as a place of burial for himself and his worthy progeny; and
commanded by his last Will and Testament (as I was told) that the honorable
remains of his Father, and Grandfather Henry, and the foresaid Robert, Earls
of Sussex, should be removed from the parish Church of Saint Laurence Poultney
London, where their bodies lay buried, to this his Chapbell at Boreham, wherein
he desired to be entombed: all which was accordingly performed. This Tomb was
made by one Richard Stephens, an outlandish man, and finished with all
furniture, as gilding, coloring, and the like, thereunto belonging, the
xxviii. of May, M.D. lxxxxix. the whole charge thereof amounting to the sum
of cclxxxxii.l. xii. s. viii. d. as appears by the account which I have seen.
This Thomas, Earl of Sussex, says Camden, was a most worthy and honorable
personage, in whose mind were seated jointly both politic wisdom, and
martial prowess, as England and Ireland acknowledged; but more of him
hereafter. These Earls of Sussex of this surname, from Robert the first, to
Robert the last, who died An. Dom. 1629. have ever been Knights of the Garter.

Pleshy.
This Collegiate Church was founded by Thomas of Woodstocke, The Foundation of
the College at (...)
Duke of Gloucester, for Canons regular: which was valued in the Kings books to
be yearly worth one hundred thirty nine pounds three shillings ten pence. The
upper part of which Church, within these few years, was taken down; and as I
was told in the Town, the Parishioners (being either unwilling or unable to
repair the decays) carried away the materials which were employed to other
uses. This part of the Church was adorned and beautified with diverse rich
funeral Monuments, which were hammered a pieces, bestowed, and divided,
according to the discretion of the Inhabitants. Upon one of the parts of a
dismembered Monument, carelessly cast here and there in the body of the Church, I
found these words.

Here lies John Holland, Io. Holland Earl of Exceter.
Earl of Exceter, Earl of Huntington, and Chamberleyne of England. Who
dyed.......

This John was half brother to King Richard the second, and Duke of Exceter.
From which dignity he was deposed, by Act of Parliament in the first year of
King Henry the fourth, whose sister he had married: and in the same year
beheaded in this Town for a seditious conspiracy (says Camden) and in the
very place where the Duke of Gloucester was arrested by King Richard, Camd. in
Essex.
which was in the base court of the Castle of Pleshie (now quite ruined) that
he might seem (says he) to have been justly punished by way of satisfaction,
for the foresaid Duke of Gloucester; of whose death he was thought to be the
principal procurer. He was beheaded the third day after the Epiphanie, 1399.
1. Hen. 4.

Upon a broken piece of a fair marble stone, reared to the side of a pillar,
whereupon were the pictures in brass of an armed knight and his Lady, this
ensuing disticke was engraven.

Militis o miserere tui, Sir Ed. Holland Earl of Mortaigne and his wife.
miserere Parentum,
Alme deus regnis gaudeat ille tuis.
Under this stone (if Tradition may go for truth) Sir Edward Holland, Earl of
Mortaigne, son of the foresaid John Holland, beheaded; with his Lady were
entombed.

But I shall forget the Founder Thomas of Woodstocke, the sixth son of King
Edward the third, and Uncle to King Richard, who was taken by force from this
his Castle of Plessy, by Thomas Mowbray, Earl Marshall, and conuayed to
Callis, where he was smothered under a Featherbed, 1397. His body was
afterward conveyed with all funeral pomp into England, and buried here in
this Church of his own foundation, Hollins. p. 489.
in a goodly sepulcher provided by himself in his life time. Whose relics
were afterward removed and laid under a marble, inlaid with brass, in the
Kings Chapel at Westminster. In which Church Elianor his wife (of whom I have
spoken before) lies entombed, Catal. of Hon. Brook.
with this French inscription, who after the death of her husband became a
Nun in the Abbey of Barking within this County.

But again to return to the Duke her husband, touching whose life and death,
with the manner thereof, thus writes Gower in his book called Vox clamantis.

Cygnus patitur de Cord benignus,
Ille prostratus non est de Rege levatus,
Ad Plessye captus tunc est velut Hostia raptus
Rex jubet arma geri, nec eo voluit misereri;
Cum Sponsa nati lugent quasi morti gravati;
Plusque Lupo sevit Rex dummodo Femina flevit.
Nil pietas munit quem tunc manus invida punit,
Rex stetit obliquus nec erat tunc unus amicus.
O Regale genus, Princeps quasi pauper egenus,
Turpiter attractus jacet et sine iure subactus.
Sunt ibi Fautores Regis de sort Priores
Qui Cygnum pendent, vbi captum ducere tendent,
Sic ducendo ducem, perdit sine lumine lucem.
Anglia que tota tenebrescit luce remota;
Trans mare natavit, regnum qui semper amavit;
Flent centum mill quia Cygnus preterit ille,
Calisij portus petit unde dolus latet ortus,
Error quem Regis genuit putredine legis
Carcere conclusus subito fuit ille reclusus,

A little after follow these verses, touching the denial of burial to be
granted unto him among the rest of his honorable and royal Ancestors.

Sic nece devictum, sic corpus ab host relictum,
Clam de conclavi susceperat Anglia navi,
Per mare regreditur, corpus nec adhuc sepelitur,
Namque sepulturam, defendit Rex sibi puram;
Desuper a latere patris loca justa tenere,
Dummodo quesivit vix bassa sepulchra subivit.
Of the manner of his death these three verses following.

Hen quam tortorum quidam de sort malorum,
Sic Ducis electi plumarum pondere lecti,
Corpus quassatum jugulant que necant jugulatum.
Such was the end of this royal Prince, son to a King, and uncle to a King:
who by our writers is discommended in this, that he was ever repining against
the King in all things whatsoever he wished to have forward: Histor Ang. l. 20.
Erat enim vir ferocissimus and precipitis ingenij (as Polidor censures him) a
most fierce man, and of an headlong wit; who thinking still that those times,
wherein he had mastred the King, were nothing changed, though the King was
above thirty yeeares old, forbear not, roughly, not so much to admonish, as to
check and school his Sovereign.

Hatfield Peuerell.
So denominated of one Randolph Peuerell the owner thereof, to whom Edward the
Confessor was very munificent for that he had married his kinswoman, Camd. in
Essex
the daughter of Ingelrick, a man of great Nobility among the English Saxons.
A Lady of that admirable beauty, that with her looks she conquered the
Conqueror William, who desired nothing more then to be her prisoner in Arms,
which to effect, he begins to express a kind of love to the remembrance of
her deceased father Ingelrick, enriching the College of Saint Martins le grand
in London, first founded by him and her uncle Edward, he honors and aduanceth
her two brethren, William Peuerell Castellane or Keeper of Dover Castle, and
Pain Peuerell Baron of Bourne or Brun, in Cambridgeshire, the founder of
Barnwell Abbey; Standard bearer to Robert Duke of Normandy in the holy war
against Infidels. He prefers her kindred and friends, he sollicites her by the
messengers of the Devils Bedchamber, his sly enchanting Bawdes, and comes
sometimes himself like Jupiter in a golden shower. Thus by these forcible
demonstrations of his love, and unavoidable allurements (especially from a
King) she was brought at length to his unlawful bed, unto whom she bare a
son named William, who was Lord of Nottingham, the founder of Lenton Abbey.
His mother (touched with remorse of conscience for her sins) to expiate her
guilt (for such was the doctrine taught in those days) founded a College here
in this village of Hatfield, The foundation (...) Hatfield College.
which she consecrated to the honor of God, and S. Mary Magdelen; wherein,
setting apart all worldly employments, she spent the remainder of her days,
and here departed her life about the year 1100. sixteen years after the
death of the Conqueror. Here she lies buried, and her image or portraiture
cut in stone is to be seen at this present day in the Church window. This
house was a Cell to Saint Albons, valued to be yearly worth 83. l. 19* s. 7. d.

Upon Corpus Christi day, in the year 1402. the third of Henry the fourth, at
Euensong time, the Devil entered into this Church, in the likeness of a Gray
Friar, and raged horribly, playing his parts like a Devil indeed, to the great
astonishment and fear of the parishioners: and the same hour with a tempest
of whirlewind and thunder, the top of the Steeple was broken down, and half
of the Chancell scattered abroad.

Waltham Abbey.
This Abbey was founded by a King of England, who of all other reigned least
and lost most. The foundation of Waltham Abbey.
For within the compass of a year, he lost both his life and his kingdom,
at one cast, and both of them to a Stranger; I mean Harold the second, the
son of Earl Godwin. Who having built and sufficiently endowed this his
Foundation, for a Deane, and eleven secular black Canons, he caused it to be
consecrated, to the honor of a certain holy Cross, Waltham Cross.
found far Westward, and brought hither by miracle. King Henry the second new
builded this Monastery, and placed therein Regular Canons; augmenting their
number to four and twenty, and also their revenues. Richard Cordelion his
son confirms the gift and exchange of the Canons made by his father, by his
Charter to be read in the Tower, in these words.

Richardus Dei gratia, etc. Inde est, quod sicut Pater noster mutationem

Henry the third increased much their revenues with Faires and Markets; a Fair
here for seven days; and at Epping a Market every Monday, and a Fair for
three days. So by the munificence of these Kings, their Successors, and
Subjects, this Abbey at the general survey, and surrender, was valued (at

The death of king Harold.
The Church of this Monastery has escaped the hammers of destruction, and with
a venerable aspect, shows unto us the magnitude of the rest of this religious
Structure. Herein Harold made his vows, and prayers, for victory when he
marched against the Norman Conqueror. In which battle by the shot of an arrow
through the left eye into his brains, he was slain the 14. of October, being
Saturday, 1066. having reigned nine months and odd days: whose body by the
mediation of his mother Githa, and two religious men of this Abbey, being
obtained of the Conqueror (howsoever at the first by him denied, affirming
that burial was not fit for him, whose ambition had been the cause of so many
funerals) was conveyed (with great lamentation) by his said mother Githa, The
burial of King Harold.
and a small dejected remainder of the English Nobility, to this his own
Church, and herein solemnly interred, upon whose Monument this Epitaph was
engraven.

Heu cadis hosle sero, Rex, a Duce Rege sutaro
Par paris gladio, milite and valido.
Firmini iusti lux est tibi, luce Calixti;
Pronior hinc superas, hinc superatus eras.
Ergo tibi requiem deposcat vtrumque perennem:
Sicque precetur eum, quod colit omne Deum.
A fierce foe thee slew, thou a King, he king in view,
Both Peers, both Peerless, both feared, and both fearlesse;
That sad day was mixed, by Firmin and Calixt.
The One helped thee to vanquish, the other made thee languish,
Both now for thee pray, and thy Requiem say;
So let good men all, to God for the call.
Girth and Leofwin his two brethren lost their lives likewise under Harolds
Banner (which was brondet (says Robert of Gloucester) with sygur of a man

which Baner aftur the Bataile Duc William sent to the Pope in tokne of the
victory.) Whose bodies were in like manner brought to this Church, and here
entombed.

It is said that Girthe, not holding it best to hazard the Kindome of England
at one cast, Camd Remains.
signified to the King, that the success of war was doubtful, that victory
was rather swayed by fortune then by valor, that advised delay was most
important in martial affairs; Sir Io. Hayward in vita Will. 1.
and if so be brother (said he) you have plighted your faith to the Duke,
retire your self, for no force can serve against a man's own conscience; God
will revenge the violation of an oath: you may reserve your self to give them
a new encounter, which will be more to their terror. As for me, if you will
commit the charge to me, I will perform both the part of a kind brother, and
a courageous Leader. For being clear in conscience, I shall sell my life, or
discomfit your enemy with more felicity.

But the King not liking his speech, answered, I will never turn my back, with
dishonor, to the Norman, neither can I in any sort digest the reproach of a
base mind: well then be it so (said some discontented of the company) let him
bear the brunt that has given the occasion.

This Harold is much commended for his courteous affability, The Charter of K.
Harold.
gentle deportment, Justice, and warlike prowess, in nothing blame worthy,
save that in the opinion of his own valor, he addicted himself wholly to his
own resolutions, neglecting the wise deliberations of his best friends and
Counselors. And that his courage could never stoop to be lower then a King.
For which he is taxed to be an impious man, falsely aspiring to the Crown by
usurpation. Of which my old Author, with whom I will conclude, has these rimes.

Richard the first, king of England, for his matchless valor surnamed
Cordelion, or Lions-heart, is, by some of our old English writers, said to have
slain a Lion, and by the pulling out of his heart, to have gained that
attribute or denomination; Hugh Nevill chief Forrester of England. Mat (...)

the truth is, that Hugh Nevill a gentleman of noble lineage, one of King
Richards special familiars, is recorded to have slain a Lion in the holy
Land, driving first an arrow into his breast, and then running him through with
his sword, whereupon this Hexameter was made.

Viribus Hugonis vires periere Leonis.

This Hugh was high Justice, Guardian, or Prothoforester of England. He died
about the sixth of King Henry the third, being full of years, and corpus eius,
says Paris, in Ecclesia de Waltam nobili Sarchophago marmoreo et in sculpto

noble engraven marble Sepulcher.

being accused by one Robert Passelew, (a man of eminent authority under King
Henry the third) of diverse transgressions, or omissions in the Forest Laws,
committed by him, by his conniuencie, or sufferance, in this Forest of
Waltham, and other the Kings Forests, Parks, and Chaces, was adjudged to pay a
Fine of two thousand marks, and ignominiouslie to be cast out of his offices,
which he took so to heart, that (not long after languishing away with sorrow)
he breathed out his afflicted spirit in July 1245. at his Manor of
Whelperfield, from whence he was conveyed to this Abbey, and here honorably
entombed by his father.

I find, in Registro Cartarum Abbatie de Waltam, that these two Nevils were
great benefactors to this Monastery, to which Hugh Nevill aforesaid, gave by
his deed the Manor of Thorndon, in these words,

Omnibus ad quos, etc. Hugo de Nevil, salutem. Noveritis quod ego pro salute
anime me, In bib Col.
et Iohanne uxoris me, per consensum and bonam voluntatem Iohannis filij mei
et heredis concessi Ecclesie de Waltham in liberam Ele^mosinam totum manerium

Robert Passelew
Robert Passelew before remembered, was here likewise interred, who was one of
the Kings instruments for gathering up money, in which his office be used such
rigor, as multitudes of people were utterly undone; so unsafe are private men's
estates, where Princes fall into great wants. He was Archdeacon of Jews,
Dannil. in vil. Hen 3.
and for his good service in this business (Kings have ever such servants to
express their pleasures in what course soever they take) he should have bin
preferred to the Bishopric of Chichester; but the Bishops withstanding the
King therein, his election was disanuld in the year 1234. being (with other)
called to a strict account for the Kings Treasure ill spent, Paris.
or worse employed, he was constrained to take Sanctuary, and seek odd
corners for his safety; yet afterward (an argument of the Kings lenity) he
was received into grace and favor: at the length leaving the troubles which
attend the Court, he lived privately at his parsonage of Derham in Norfolk,
but died at his house here in Waltham upon the sixth day of June, in the year
1252. of whom will it please you hear Matthew Paris speak in his own language.

improprietie. Out of the collections of Camden, Mss. in Bib. Cot.

Here stands a fair monument to the memory of Sir Edward Denny, (son of the
right honorable Sir Antony Denny, Counselor of Estate and one of the
executors of King Henry the eight) and of Ioane Champernoun his wife; of whom
more hereafter.

This Monastery is now one of the mansion houses of that honorable Lord, Sir
Edward Denny Knight, Baron Denny of Waltham, and Earl of Norwich.

I found since I writ the premises, that Edward the Confessor was the prime
cause of this religious foundation, for that he gave to Harold certain Lands
here conditionally that he should thereupon build a Monastery, and furnish it
with all necessaries, as appears by his Charter of that donation amongst the
Records in the Tower.

Horne-Church.
Named in times past (says M. Camden) Cornutum Monasterium, the Horned
Minster, for that there shoot out at the end of the Church certain points of
Lead fashioned like hotnes. To the brethren de monte Iovis, or Mountioy;
Priorie de cornuto. Stow Suruay.
or Priory de cornuto by Hauering at the Bower (says Stow) the house of Savoy
in the Strand did sometime belong, which Eleanor wife to King Henry the third,
purchased of the said Fraternity or Brotherhood, for her son Edmond Earl of
Lancaster. The inhabitants of this parish say (by tradition) that this Church
was built by a female conuertite, to expiate and make satisfaction for her
former sins; and that it was called Hore-Church at the first, Hore-Church.
until by a certain King, but by what King they are uncertain, which came
riding that way, it was called, The Horned-Church, who caused those Horns to
be put out at the East end of the same, in remembrance of so remarkable a
Foundation.

But to leave these conjectures and return to the Grauestones which I find
thus inscribed.

I will borrow an Epitaph for this Infant which I read in Rome in the Church,
bearing the title of S. Maria in Aracaeli.

Pilgrims came to King Edward the Confessor from Jerusalem, and gave him a
ring; which ring he had secretly before given to a poor man that asked his
charity in the name of God, and Saint John the Euanglist: and that these
Pilgrims gave the said Edward notice of his own death, according to these old
rimes.

wife to King Edward the fourth: upon the Frontispice of which, these verses

Vpmenster.
This town of Vpmenster or Vpminster, as it is diversely written, lying three
miles from Rumpford, requires some large remembrance from me, in respect that
it has enjoyed within little more then the space of three hundred years,
diverse eminent families, who have been Lords of the same, or at least of the
Manor of Gains, called also the Manor of Vpmenster, lying within the same; to
which manor, as long tradition has left to posterity, there is a little Isle
or Chapel, standing on the north side of the Chancell of the same Church,
belonging, and time out of mind, appendant to the Manor of Gains aforesaid,
and appropriated to the Lords of the same for their particular place of burial
for themselves and their issue.

The first family (of whose posterity I can dilate) which I find to have
been Lords of the said manor of Gains, alias Vpmenster, was that most ancient
surname of Engaine (whether thence drawn or no, I leave to others to
conjecture) and it is warranted by a long tradition that Sir John Engain
Knight, the son of Vitalis Engayn being Ex Autographo eiusdem carry dat an. 2
E^ 1. penes Radulphum Lathum A^m^g dominum Mancrie eiusdem.
Lord of the said manor, did build the before mentioned Chapel, which since
has received its denomination from the blessed Virgin. This family ended in
the male line, when Sir Thomas Engayne Knight, son of John Engayne Esquire,
and grandchilde to the former Sir John, left his three daughters, his coheirs,
of whom Iocosa the eldest was wife of John de Goldington. Elizabeth the second,
was married to Sir Lawrence de Pakenham knight: and Mary the third daughter and
coheire, Escaetr. de. a. 41. E. 3.
was wife of Sir William de Barnake knight. There is no Tomb or grauestone
left of this family, but only their Coatarmour in the East window of the
aforesaid Chapel.

This Manor of Gains, alias Vpmenster, was afterward severally in the
possession of Simon de Hauering ( Ex Autographo eiusdem cartae dat. 10. Iulij,
a. 15. E. 1. penes R. L. praedictum.
who I conceive was but the Feoffe in trust of Sir John the son and heir of
John Engayne) of Alice de Perrers, Rot Pat. de a. 3. R. 2. part 3.
afterward attainted by Act of Parliament in a. 1. R. 2. and of Henry de la
Field, whose further mention leaving the first two in silence, serves only to
this present Narration.

The said Henry de la Field did by his Deed indented, a. 9. H 4. entaile the
said manor upon Richard, Penes Rad. Lath, praedict.
Walter, and John his sons, each after other upon the default of issue; and
lastly, upon John Deincourt and Elizabeth his wife, the daughter of the said
Henry de la Field, in whose right afterward it should seem he came to be Lord
thereof; and there lies buried together, with his wife, under a fair Tomb,
placed just under the Arch which divides the said north Chapel or Isle from
the Chancell of Vpmenster Church.

Es testis Christ quod non iacet hic lapis iste
Corpus vt ornetur sed spiritus vt memoretur.
And about the tomb, though somewhat mutilated is written this Epitaph.

Sancte deus sancte fortis sancte miserecors saluator miserere: Animabus Rogeri

The next owner of this manor of a new surname, I find to have been Nicholas
Wait, of whom or his family, I can say little; only by his sale it came to
be the inheritance of Ralph Lathum Esquire, a lyneall descendant in the male
line, from a younger branch of the ancient family of Lathom of Lancashire, who
were Lords of that place in the said County (as all the received descents of
that family warrant) from the time of King R. 1. until the latter end of E.
3. when Isabel the sole daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Lathom Knight, was
married to Sir John Stanlye knight, from whom the now earl of Darbie is
lineally descended, and (as I conceive) is from the right of this
intermarriage, Lord of the Manor of Lathom at this day.

The Epitaph of this above said Ralph Lathom, is placed in brass, set into a
fair marble stone, covering his tomb, and is as follows.

Here lies buried Rayff Lathum esquire, late Lord of Vpmistre, and She was the
daughter of Sir Wi^liam Roche Knight.
Elizabeth his wife, which Rayffe deceased the xix. day of July, An.
M.ccccc.Lvii. whose soul and all christen souls Jesus have mercy.

The next family to whom by the sale of William Lathom, son and heir of the
aforesaid Ralfe Lathom, the before mentioned Manor of Gains did appertain,
was the family of D'Ewes, (from whom also it was again at last repurchased by
Lathom) for Adrian D'Ewes being descended of the ancient stem of Des Ewes,
Dynasts or Lords of the Dition of Kessell in the Duchy of Gelderland, settling
and marrying in England not many years after the beginning of the reign of
King H. 8. had issue, Gerardt D'Ewes his son and heir, who having purchased
the said Manor of Gains as aforesaid, was after his death, according to the
former usage, buried in the said Chapel, appendant to the said Manor, as
other Lords of the same had been, whose Epitaph, because it is replenished
with many particulars touching the antiquity and ensigns of this family. I
have been more exact in the full delineation thereof in the figure following.

Rog. Lancaster. In his Crono. descrip. of Essex, a Mss.
In the Church lies buried Roger of Lancaster, who married Philip daughter and
heir of Hugh de Bulbeck, the second, says Norden, and lies cross legged in
an ancient tomb of white stone, upon which no inscription remains. He was,
in her right, Lord of Stansted, the said manor afterward came unto Hugo de
Playze, by marriage of the youngest daughter of Richard Mont-fitchet, of whom
came Elizabeth Countess of Oxford, who was daughter to John Howard knight, by
whom the land came to the Earl of Oxford.

South Church.
In this Church are some old Monuments of the Bruins, which have been old
inhabitants there, and descended, says Norden, as he thinks, from Jordan le
Brune, Jordan le Brune.

Here is an old manor wherein the old knights which surnamed themselves of the
town, Church, Rich. Church
inhabited, whereof one Sir Richard in Henry the thirds time, was one of the
kings Justices for Jail delivery. He gave the greatest part of his land to
Christ's Church in Canterbury, moved thereunto for want of heirs males.

Shopland.
In Shopland is an ancient manor called Butlers, Butler
of a race of knights, and gentlemen that dwelt there, and gave three covered
Cups, as appears in the Church window, there is one most beautiful Monument
in the Church, made to the memory of one Staple, Staple
a Sergeant at Arms, to King Ed. the third, which gave in his Shield a Salter
mixed with Staples: which in colors with other Scutcheons remain in the North
windows. His tomb is thus inscribed.

Canewdon.
A great parish, so called from King Canutus the Dane, who kept his Court here;
unde Canuti domus. The Manor house has been double trenched, and fensed
after the oldest fashion. In the same are other Manors exceeding ancient: as
that of Clarendon Hall, the old seat of the Chanceux, Sir Giles Chanceux
many of them were knights; as Sir Giles Chanceux, in Edward the first his
time; many of them lie buried in the Church, with their Pictures, Scutcheons,
and French Poesies all defaced. Another Manor called Breamstons, or rather
Beanstons, honored by knights, descended of Bartholomew a younger son to the
Earl of Ewe in Normandy; it has been inhabited by a knight or more of the
name of Scot. Scot
Another Manor called Apton Hall, and another called Piuersey Hall, whereof
Sir John Greyton was Lord in Edward the first his time. Sir Io. Greyton
One of the best called Lamberne Hall, Lamberne
whereof one Lamberne under Swain was Lord in the Conquest time, and so
continued till Richard the second, at which time his daughter Thamasin carried
all to Toteham, and from thence to Barington, and from thence to Lumsford a
Squire of Sussex, that being better planted in his native Country, uses this
for a Farm: as I think it was in Lambernes time.

So many Lordships in the parish have caused so many of their owners to honor
this Church with their Sepultures, but to whose memory, in particular, any one
of these monuments were erected, cannot be discerned, they are all so
shamefully abused.

Richard, was the only offspring of so many knights of the Berners of Berners
Roding in Essex. This Sir James Berners had three sons: Sir Richard Berners

There be other funeral Monuments in this Church, erected to the honor of
this family; but their Inscriptions are all torn or worn out, and their
Sepulchers, like all the rest, foulie defaced: These Tirells (me thinks) having
been gentlemen, for so many reuolutions of years, of exemplarie note, and
principal regard, in this Country, might have preserved these houses of rest
for their Ancestors, from such violation. But the Monuments are answerable to
the Church, both ruinous.

This Surname has ever been as remarkable as ancient, since Walter Tirrell
the French knight slew his cousin king William Rufus. Of whom thus much out of
the Norman History.

Gualter Tirrell a knight of Normandy, cousin to William Rufus (and the killer
of the said William) after the unfortunate death of the said William departed
into Normandy, where he lived long in the Castle of Chawmont, and there
deceased.

The place where he swomme the water, upon the sudden death of his Sovereign,
is called Tirrells Foard to this day.

Edward Mackwilliams Esquire. and Henry his Son, with Anne Spelman, wife of the

Epitaph following is engraven or inlaid in brass.

Edward Mackwilliams, his son Henry and Anne his wife.
Remember all ye that by this town be to pass,
And groundly revolue in yowr rememberance,
Both the world is frail and britle as glass,
The end is death of every man's chance:
All worldly people must learn to foot his dance;
As Edward Mackwilliham that lith under this stonn,
Out of this transytorye liff is past and gonn:
Harry Mackwilliham, his son, lith here also,
with Ann Mackwilliham his loving wiff and dear,
These three persons togidder and no mo,
Under this Tomb interred they be here.
Prey for their souls, I prey you, with heart inteere,
A Pater Noster an Ave, and a Creed,
And iii hundryd deyes of pardon you have for yowr meede.
This Anne is figured on the Tomb kneeling, with the Spelmans Arms of plates
all over her gown, and so in the great East-window of the Chancell.

Ashdon.
In the south Isle of this Church, and in the south window thereof, there are
seen three several Cloptons kneeling in their complete Armor, with their
several Escurchions of Arms upon their breasts, (being S. a bend Or, Sir Will.
Clopton.
between 2 cotizes dauncitee Or) of which three the first is sir William
Clopton Knight, there mentioned to have died in the fifth year of King Edward
the third. Sir Tho. Clopton
The second Sir Thomas Clopton Knight mentioned to have died the second year
of the reign of King Richard the second, and the third Edmund Clopton, Ed.
Clopton.
the year of whose decease is there set down to have been the thirteenth
year of the said King Richard. And it is very likely the said Edmund lies
there buried under the Window: for Sir William de Clopton of Clopton, the
father of these three, and of other brethren buying the Manor of Newenham,
lying for the most part in this parish, of John de Lacy, the brother and heir
of Sir Henry de Lacy Knight, in anno 2. E. 3. (of which I have seen the
original deed) left to the said Edmund his second son by Iuetta the daughter
of William de Gray, Penes Simonds D^ Ewes Equit. aurat.
his first wife, his said Manor, from whom it descending to William Clopton
his son and heir, and he dying without issue (as did also Sir William
Clopton, the son of the above mentioned Sir William. Autographum vidi, penes
S. D' Ewes Eq. aurat.
) The said Manor of Newenham passed by Conueyance, dated at Ashdon: 6. die
Iunij an. 13. Hen. 4. as did most of all the other large possessions of the
Cloptons in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, to William Clopton of Melford, the
son and heir of Sir Thomas Clopton Knight, who lies buried with his wife,
the daughter and heir of Mylde, under a fair Tomb in the north Isle of the
said Church of Melford, called the Cloptons Isle, as does also the said William
Clopton his son lie buried under the same Tomb, William Clopton.
and Margery his wife, the daughter and heir of Elias Francis Esquire, in the
same Isle, whose Epitaph is there found on her Graue-stone, as follows.

Hic iacet Margeria Clopton, Margery Clopton.
nuper vxor Willielmi Clopton Armig. filia* et here is Elie Francis Armigeri que
obijt.......Iunij Anno Dom. M. cccciiii. euius anime propitietur Deus.

And on this grauestone is there an Escutcheon of Clopton, with an Ermine on
the bend, empaled with the Arms of Francis, being gules, a Salteire between
four crosses formie Patees, Or, from which said William and Margerie, have the
three several Families of Cloptons of Kentwell, Castelins and Liston
descended, and the first been much enobled by the marriage of the daughter and
heir of Roydon, descended likewise from the several heirs or coheires of
Knyuet, Belhous, Fitz-warren, Basset of Welledon, and diverse other ancient
families, as was that family of Lyston, by the marriage of the daughter and
heir of Say, whose ancestors had been long owners of that manor, Abstract.
Releuior. de Scaccar. Regis termino. Hill a. 37. Ed. 3.
and held it in Capite, as Clopton now does, by the service of making Wafers at
the Kings Coronation.

And because these foresaid three Families of Clopton, did descend, as I have
already noted, and were at once branched forth from Sir William Clopton of
Lutons in the County of Suffolk Knight: it shall not be impertinent to set
down his Epitaph, as it is now to be seen on his grauestone in the North
Isle of the said Chapel of Melford Church, amongst diverse others of his
Ancestors, being as follows.

Sir Will. Clopton Knight, and Ioane his wife.
Orate pro animabus Willielmi Clopton militis et Iohanne Consortis sue, Qui
quidem Willielmus, obijt vicesimo die Febrarij Anno Dom. millesimo
quingentesimo tricesimo quorum animabus propitietur Deus. Amen.

And on the grauestone above this Epitaph, is the Cloptons coat before
mentioned, empaled with Marrow, which is Azure a fesse nebulee, inter three
Maidens heads coupes, by the Shoulders Ar, the periwiggs, Or.

Thus much of the Cloptons I had from that studious learned gentleman Sir
Simond D'Ewes Knight, of which much more when I come to Melford and
Tallo-wratting Church in Suffolk.

Here lyth Nicholas Inglefield Esquyr, sometime Controler of the house to King
Rychard the second, who dyed the first of April in the year of Grase,
M.cccc.xv. whose soul Jesus perdon, Amen, Amen, Amen.

Here end the Monuments in the County of Essex.
Additions, or certain Epitaphs and Inscriptions upon Tombs and Grauestones
within certain Churches in the City of London: Collected by my self and
others not many years ago, of which, few or none, of any Antiquity, are
remaining in the said Churches at this present day; such is the despite not so
much of Time, as of maleuolent people to all Antiquities, especially of this
kind.
In Saint Paul's.
IN this Cathedral Church, and near unto Sir John Beauchamps Tomb, (commonly
called Duke Vmfreys) upon a fair marble stone, inlaid all over with brass,
(of all which, nothing but the heads of a few brazen nails are at this day
visible) and engraven with the representation and cote-Armes of the party
defunct. Thus much of a mangled funeral Inscription was of late time
perspicuous to be read, as follows.

Hic iacet Paganus Roet miles Guyenne Rex Armorum Pater Catherine Ducisse

This Sir Pain Roet had issue, the aforesaid Duchess, and Anne who was
married to Geffrey Chaucer, Geffrey Chaucer Brother in Law by marriage to John,
Duke of Lancaster.
our famous English Poet, who by her had issue. Sir Thomas Chaucer, whose
daughter Alice was married to Thomas Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, by whom she
had no issue, and after to William de la Pole Duke of Suffolk, and by him had
John Duke of Suffolk and others.

The abouesaid Katherine, eldest daughter of this King of Arms, was first
married to Sir Otes Swynford Knight, and after to John of Gaunt the great Duke
of Lancaster; of whose issue by her is observed to be descended a most royal
and illustrious of spring; videlicet, Eight Kings, four Queens, and five
Princes of England; Six Kings, and three Queens of Scotland; two Cardinals,
above twenty Dukes, and almost as many Duchess of the kingdom of England;
diverse Dukes of Scotland, and most of all the now ancient Nobility of both
these Kingdoms, besides many other potent Princes, and eminent nobility of
foreign parts.

Here under a large marble stone (whereupon no Inscription is at this day
remaining, neither any Effigies of the deceased left; both of which were inlaid
and engraven upon the monument as I was credibly informed) lies interred the
body of Sir John Wriothesley Knight, alias, Garter, principal King at Arms,
Father of William Wriothesley, York Herald; who had issue, Thomas Wriothesley,
Knight of the Garter, Lord Chancellor of England, and the first of that
surname, Earl of Southampton.

His creation was the eighteenth year of the reign of King Ed. 4. as appears
by this his Patent following.

Now here I have just occasion given me, to set down the manner of the creation
or crowning of Garter, principal K. of Arms, and of Clarentieux and Norroy,
Provincial Kings of Arms; as also the creation of Heralds, and Pursuiuants of
Arms: which anciently was done by the King, but of later times is performed by
the Earl Marshall, having an especial Commission therefore signed by the King
for every particular Creation. And first I will begin with Garter, and show
what necessaries are to be provided for him, at the time he shall be crowned,
which are these following.

A Book and a Sword to be sworn upon.

A Crown guilt.

A Collar of Esses*

A Bowl of wine, which Bowl is fee to the new created King.

And a Coat of Arms of velvet richly enbroydered.

The creation or crowning of Garter, as well anciently as in these days, was,
and is on this manner. I will instance with Sir Gilbert Dethick knight, who was
created Garter principal king of Arms, on Sunday the twentieth day of April,
in the fourth of Ed. the sixth.

First, the said Garter kneeled down before the Kings majesty, and the Kings
Sword was holden on a book, and the said Garter laid his hand upon the book,
and also upon the sword, whiles Clarentieux, king of arms, read the oath. And
when the oath was red, and the said Garter had kissed the book and the sword,
then the said Clarentieux read the letters patents of his office; (which were
dated the 29. of April in the year aforesaid) In the reading whereof, as the
words do follow in order, so did the Kings majesty first take the cup of
wine, and pouring it on his head, named him Garter. After that, his Majesty
put on him his coat of Arms, and the collar of SS about his neck, and lastly
the crown upon his head, and so finished the ceremony.

The oath of Garter principal King of arms at a Chapter holden at Greenwich
in the 28 year of King Henry the eight.
Ye shall take the oath that ye shall obey first of all the supreme head of
this most noble Order, and after him, the other knights of the same, namely, in
such things as shall belong to your office, and shall be found reasonable. And
because ye be taken in here, as to be privy of counsel here to be taken. Ye
shall swear that ye shall be a man of silence, true and faithful in all
things here to be done, and shall in no wise disclose any part thereof.

Ye shall swear also, that ye shall faithfully and diligently, fulfill
perform and execute such things as shall be committed, put in credit, or
charge unto you. And ye shall diligently enquire of all noble and notable acts
of any, and of every of the Knights of this most noble Order; and ye shall
certify the Register thereof, that he may the better describe and commend the
same to memory.

Moreover, if any Knight of this order die, ye shall incontinent upon
knowledge thereof, cause the Sovereign, and after him the other Knights, then
alive, to be ascertayned thereof.

And finally, ye shall swear, that ye shall truly and faithfully, use and
exercise this same your office. So God you help, and this holy Euangely.

The creation of the Provincial Kings of Arms, viz. Clarencieux and Norroy,
for which are to be provided.
First, his Letters Patents.

Item, a Book to take his oath upon.

Item, a Sword, which is to be drawn, and laid cross on the book.

Item, a Crown, which must be set on his head.

Item, a Collar of SS about his neck.

Item, a Bowl of wine, which must be poured on his head, and that Bowl is
fee to the new created King.

Item, a Coat of Arms of Velvet richly embrodered.

The manner of the creation of a Provincial King of Arms.
He shall be brought into the presence of the King, or his Earl Marshall, or
the Earl Marshals Deputy, by the two other Kings, all the Heralds and
Pursuiuants following. Then he kneeleth down, while Garter reads the
articles of his oath, holding his hand upon a book and sword. That done, he
kisseth the book, and hilts of the sword. Then his patent is read by an
Herald, and as the words following be read, his Coat is first put on by the
King, his Marshall or Deputy, then the Collar of SS put aabout his neck, then
the Crown on his head, and lastly the Bowl of wine poured on his head,
calling him by his name, as Clarencieux, or Norroy.

The Oath of the King of Arms at the time when he shall be crowned.
Ye shall swear by the Oath that ye received when ye were created Herald, and
by the faith that ye owe unto the King our Sovereign Lord, whose Arms you
bear, that you shall truly keep such things as been comprised in these
articles following.

First, whenever the King shall command you to do any message to any other
King, Prince, Estate, or any other person out of this Realm; or to any person,
of what Estate, degree, or condition he be of within the same, that ye shall
do it as honorably and truly as your wit and reason can serve you; And as
greatly to the aduentage of our Sovereign Lord the King, and this his Realm,
and true report bring again to his Highness of your messages, and as near to
the charge to you committed, in word, and in substance, as your said reason may
attain unto. Always keeping your self secret for any manner of motion, save to
such persons as ye be commanded to utter your charge unto.

Secondly, ye shall do your true deuoir every day to be more cunning then
other in the office of Arms, so that ye may be the better furnished to teach
other in the office of Arms under you, and execute with more wisdom and
eloquence, such charges as our Sovereign Lord, or any Nobleman of his Realm,
shall lay unto you, by virtue of the office the which his Highness will elect
you to at this time. Discovering in no wise that ye are charged to keep close,
unless it be prejudicial unto the King our Sovereign Lord, and to his Realm.

Thirdly, ye shall do your full diligence to have knowledge of all the Noble
Gentlemen within your Marches, which should bear coats in the field, in the
service of our Sovereign Lord, his Liuetenants, Officers, or Commissioners,
and them with their Issues truly to register, and such Arms as they bear with
their differences due in Arms to be given, and to enquire if any of them hold
by any service, as by Knights Fee, whereby they should do the King our
Sovereign Lord service in the defense of this his Realm, which also ye shall
truly and indifferently note and register.

Fourthly, ye shall not be strange to teach Pursuiuants or Heralds, ne to ease
them in such doubts concerning the office of Arms as they shall move you unto,
and such as cannot be eased by you, ye shall show to the Constable or Marshall;
or if any Pursuiuant ask any doubt of you, ye shall ask him first whether he
have desired any of the Heralds to instruct him in the same; and if he say
nay, ye shall limit him to one of them, or ease him if you can. And if you
cannot, to move the said cause at the next Chapter, and if the said doubt be
not there determined, by the said Chapter, then to show it to the Constable or
Marshall. Also ye shall keep duly in your Marches (if ye be present in the
precincts thereof) your Chapters, to the increase of cunning in the office of
Arms, and the doubts that there cannot be eased, ye shall move unto the
Constable or Marshall.

Fifthly, ye shall observe and keep to your cunnning and power, all such Oaths
as ye made when ye were created Herald, to the honor and worship of Nobles,
and integrity of living. Namely, in eschuing of dislandered places and persons
reproached, and to be more ready to excuse then to blame any Noble person,
unless ye be charged to say the sooth by the King, Constable, or Marshall, in
place Judicial. And also ye shall promise truly to register all acts of
honor in manner and form as they be done, as far forth as your cunning and
power may extend. So help you God and the holy Euangeles, and by the cross of
this Sword, that longs to Knighthode.

Necessaries to be provided for the Creation of an Herald of Arms.
First, a Book, whereon he must take his oath:

Item, a Sword, which must be drawn.

Item, his Letters Patents, which must be read by an Officer.

Item, a Collar of SS of silver, to put about his neck.

Item, a Bowl of wine to pour upon his head, which Bowl the new Herald is to
have.

Item, his Coat of Arms, which must be Satin embroydered, and enriched with
gold.

The manner of the Heralds creation.
The Herald of Arms is brought into the presence of the King or his Earl
Marshall, or the Earl Marshals Deputy, by two of the eldest Heralds, the Kings
of Arms going before them, and all the Heralds and Pursuiuants following, all
making their due reverence. Then he kneeleth down, and his oath being read by
Garter, he swears to the contens by kissing both the Book and cross of the
Sword hilt. The Patent is read by one of the Heralds, and at Investimus, the
king or the Earl Marshall turns the Coat Sleeves to the sides, and puts
the Collar of SS about his neck, whereby he is created an Esquire; but of late
times the Coat is carried in by an Herald of Arms, and after by him presented
to the Earl Marshall, who immediately inuesteth the new Herald therewith; and
at Nomen imponimus, he pours the wine upon his head, and calls him by his
name, as Lancaster, or otherwise, as his office does require.

The Oath of the Herald at the time of his creation before his Sovereign.
First, ye shall swear that ye shall be true to the most high and mighty
Prince the King, our Sovereign Lord. And if you have any knowledge, or hear
any imagination of treason, or language, or words that might sound to the
derogation or hurt of his estate and highness (which God defend) ye shall in
that case as hastily, and as soon as it is to you possible, discover and show
it unto his highness, or to his noble and discreet Council: and to conceal
it in no wise.

Also, ye shall promise and swear that ye shall be conversant, and
serviceable to all Gentlemen, to do their commands to their worship and
knighthood, by your good counsel that God has sent you, and ever ready to
offer your service unto them.

Also ye shall promise and swear to be secret, and to keep the secrets of
Knights, Esquires, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, as a confessor of arms; and not
to discover them in any wise, except it be for treason, as it is before said.

Also ye shall promise and swear, if fortune fall you in diverse Lands and
Countries wherein you go or ride, that you find any gentleman of name, and of
arms, that has lost his goods in worship and knighthood, in the Kings
service, or in any other place of worship, and is fallen into poverty, ye
shall aid, support, and succor him in that ye may, and if he ask you of your
good to his sustenance, ye shall give him part of such good as God has sent
you, to your power, and as you may bear.

Also ye shall promise and swear, if you be in any place, that you hear any
language between party and party, that is not worshipful, profitable, nor
virtuous, that you keep your mouth close, and report it not forth, but to
their worship, and the best.

Also ye shall promise and swear, if so be you be in any place, that you hear
any debate or language dishonest between gentleman and gentlewoman, the which
ye be privy to, if so be ye be required by Prince, Judge, or any othere to
bear witness, unless that the law will needs compel you so to do: you
shall not without license of both parties; and when ye have leave, ye shall
not for any favor, love, or awe, but say the sooth to your knowledge.

Also ye shall promise and swear, to be true and secret to all gentlewomen,
widows, and maidens, and in case that any man would do them wrong, or force
them, or disinherite them of their Liuelyhood, and they have no good to pursue
them for their right to Princes, or Judges: if they require you of
supportation, ye shall support them, with your good wisdom and counsel to
Princes and Judges.

Also ye shall promise and swear, that you shall forsake all places of
dishonesty, the play of Hazardy, and the common haunt of going unto Tauernes,
and other places of debates, eschuing vices, and taking you to virtues to your
power. This article, and all other articles above said, ye shall truly keep,
so God you help, and holydoome, and by this Book, and Cross of this Sword,
that belongs to Knighthood.

Things necessary to be provided for the Creation of a Pursuiuant at Arms.
First a Book, whereon he must take his Oath.

Item, his Letters Patents which must be read by an Officer.

Item, His coat of Arms of Dammaske embroydered.

Item, a Bowl of wine to be poured on his head, and that Bowl is to be taken
by the new Pursuiuant of Arms.

The manner of the Pursuiuants Creation.
The Pursuiuant of arms shall be brought into the presence of the King, (or
his Earl Marshall, or the Earl Marshals Deputy) between two of the eldest
Pursuiuants, and kneel down before him, laying his hand upon the book,
Garter principal King of arms reads the oath under written; and so he
kisseth the book. Then his letters Paten^s shall be read by an Herald, and
when he says Creamus, the King or the Earl Marshall puts on his Coat of
arms, with the sleeue before. And when he says Nec non nomen vulgariter etc.
the King or the Earl Marshall pours the Bowl of wine upon his head, calling
him by his name, as Portcullis, or otherwise as his office requires.

The aduertisment and oath of a Pursuiuant of Arms at the time of his creation.
First ye shall swear that ye shall be true to the most high, most mighty, and
most excellent Prince the King, our Sovereign Lord. And if you have any
knowledge, or hear any imagination of treason, or language, or word, that
shall sound to the derogation or hurt of his Estate and Highness (which God
defend) ye shall in that case as hastily, and as soon, as it is to you
possible, discover and show it to his Highness, or to his noble and discreet
Counsel.

Also ye shall dispose you to be lowly, humble, and serviceable to all Estates
universal that Christian been, not lying in wait to blame, ne hurt none of
the said Estates in any thing that may touch their honors.

Also ye shall dispose you to be secret and sober in your port, and not too
busy in language, ready to commend, and loath to blame; and diligent in your
service, eschuing from vices, and taking you to virtues, and true in your
reports, and so to exercise, while ye be in the Office of a Pursuiuant, that
your merits may cause your more preferring in the Office of Arms in time
coming.

All such Articles and things as belongs to a Pursuiuant of Arms to keep,
you shall well and truly observe and keep. So help you God, and Holydome, and
by this Book.

A Catalogue showing what Kings of Arms were in former Ages, and now out of
use in this Realm: as also the Succession of the Kings Heralds, and
Pursuiuants of Arms have from ancient times to this present day succeeded one
another.
And first, The Succession of the principal Kings of Arms.
GArter is the principal King of Arms (as I have written before) and goes
first as the only ringleader of them all: Garter principal King of Arms.
not so much for the antiquity of his Creation, as for the supereminence of
the Order of the Garter: for he was but instituted by King Henry the fifth. His
peculiar Office is (which partly you may read in his oath) with all dutiful
service to attend upon the Knights of the Garter at their Solemnities: To
advertise them which are chosen of their new election, to call them to be
enstaulled at Windsore; To cause their Arms to be hanged up upon their Seats,
and to marshall the Funeral Rites and Ceremonies of them, as also of the
greater Nobility, as of Princes, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, and
Barons: and to do many other services unto the King and State.

The privileges of Garter King of Arms, his goods and Servants as appears
in the Black*booke of the most honorable Order of the Garter. Whereof this
ancient institution following is enregistred.

Hij tres hujus ordinis officiales Scriba, videlicet, Garterus Rex Armorum, and
Hostiarius ab atra virga nuncupatus; ipsi cum suis tam rebus quam ministris in
suis officijs permanentibus sub perpetua supremi protectione ac propugnaculo
secure durabunt. Vnde si quaevis injuria seu violentia ipsis inferatur, vel ab
eis qui supremo subjecti sunt, vel externis quoties causas suas arbitrio
supremi submittent, ipse cu^ Sodalibus exhibebit eis iusticiam aut exhibe^dam
ex aequo et congruo procurabit. Si vero pars aduersa causam suam supremo
submittere detractabit ipse cum Commilitonibus eum erga Officiales hos animum
habebit, vt ipsorum causam quoad iustum at que aequum erit cum debito fauore
tueri velit.

Sir William Brugge or Brugges knight, In Arch. Turr. Land.
was the first King of the name Garter, in the reign of Henry the fifth, as
aforesaid; His Patent was confirmed by Henry the sixth in the four and
twentieth year of his reign, as it is in the Patent Rolls of that year, the
eleventh membrane.

John Smert succeeded Sir William Brugge in the said Office Patent, Ann. 39.
Hen. 6. Member 14. In the fourteenth of Edward the fourth, he was employed with
a defiance to the French King Lewis the eleventh; The which no little abashed
the said King. Yet nevertheless following the said Officer of Arms
directions, obtained by that means a Peace which he much coueted. And Edward
the fourth as willingly assented, because he was deceived by the Duke of
Burgundy and the Constable of France, who failed him in their promised aides.
The French King gave unto the said King of Arms upon his return three hundred
French Crowns, and a piece of Velvet of thirty yard^ long.

The next was Sir John Wrythe or Wriothesley, here interred, and created as
aforesaid.

This Sir John Wriothesley, Ann. 23. Edwardi quarti, was employed into
Scotland, and with him Northumberland Herald, with letters of procuracie
signed, and sealed by the King his master to redemand diverse great sums of
money which had been disbursed to James the third, King of Scots, upon a
promise of marriage intended to have been made between the Prince of
Scotland, and Lady Cicily, daughter of King Edw. the fourth, who in that
Treaty having the liberty of refusal, thereupon redemanded the foresaid
sums by his said procuratours.

Next to him Sir Thomas Wriothesley created in the time of Henry the seventh.

This Sir Tho. Wriothesley in the 19. of H. 8. was joined Ambassador with
Viscount Lisle (the natural son to King Edward the fourth) and others which
carried the Garter to the French King Francis the first.

He that succeeded him was Sir Thomas Wall, Knight, created Ann. 26. Hen. 8.

Sir Christopher Baker Knight of the Bathe created Garter, Ann. 28. Hen. 8.
1536.

Sir Gilbert Dethick Knight, was preferred to the Office of Garter, the fourth
of Edward the sixth. He died in the year 1584.

This Sir Gilbert Dethick was joined Ambassador with the Marquess of
Northampton, to carry the Garter to the French King Henry the second, Ann. 5.
E. 6. And the like for the same purpose to the Prince of Pymont, with Edward
Lord Clynton; And also with the Lord Hunsden to the French King Charles the
ninth: and with the Earl of Sussex) to the Emperor Maximilian; and likewise
with the Lord Willoughby to Frederick King of Denmark.

Sir William Dethick Knight, was crowned Garter in the eight and twentieth
year of Queen Elizabeth; he was deposed the first year of King James. This
Sir William Dethick lies buried in Paul's, near unto Sir Pain Roet, under a
large marble-stone. Whereupon this Inscription following is engraven.

Hic.....in Domino, Gulielmus Dethick Eques Auratus filius and here is Gilberti
Dethick Equitis aurati. Qui ambo fuerunt Garterij Principales Reges Armorum
Anglicorum. Hic Anno 1584. aetat. 84. Ille anno 1612. etat. suae 70. in Domino
obdormierunt.

And after his deposing Sir William Segar Knight (now living, Ann. 1631.) was
created Garter: he has written a learned book called Honor Military and
Civil.

A Succession of the Provincial Kings of Arms.
Provincial Kings of Arms are, at this day, only two, Clarentieux, and
Norrey. Clarentieux was ordained by Edward the fourth: for he obtaining the
Dukedom of Clarence by the death of George his brother, who was secretly
murdered in the Tower of London, made the Herald which properly belonged to
the Duke of Clarence, a King at Arms, and called him Clarentius, or
Clarentieux: but in whose time, or upon what occasion this name, and Office of
Clarencieux began, I do not find, says Sir Henry Spelman, Glosslit H. but
certainly it was of greater Antiquity then from Edward the fourth, and might
be called South-Roy, of his Province of South, as North-Roy or Norroy of the
North parts. His proper Office is to Marshall and dispose the Funerals of all
the lesser Nobility, as Knights and Esquires, through the Realm on the South
side of Trent.

The office of Norrey (the time nor the reason of his Creation and Title I do
not know) is the same on the North side of Trent, that Clarentieux has on this
side, as may well appear by his name, signifying the Northern King, or King
of the North parts.

These two (says Milles) have by Charter power to visit the Noblemens
Families, to set down their Pedegrees, to distinguish their Arms, and in the
open Market place to reprove such as falsely take upon them Nobility or
Gentry. And to order every man's Exequies and Funerals, according to their
dignity, and to appoint unto them their Arms or Ensigns.

The names, surnames, and several adjuncts of these Kings of Arms, according
to the foresaid Catalogue beginning at Edward the first, and continued to these
times.
Jacques Hedingley in the time of King Ed. the first, was King of Arms by the
name of Guyon. Sir Pain Rowet in the reign of Edward the third, was King of
Arms by the name of Guyon. John March was King of Arms by the name of Norroy,
2. pars pat. An. 9. R. 2. Membr. 21. Richard del Brugge, otherwise called
Lancaster, was King of Arms for the North in the time of Henry the fourth, and
in the first of Henry the fifth. William Tyndall in the time of the foresaid
Henry the fourth, was King of Arms by the name of Lancaster.
..... in the time of Henry the fifth, was King of Arms by the name of
Agincourt. Kings of Arms in the reign of King H. the 5.

employed into France the first year of his Majesty, and from thence attended
our Queen into England; who, with Sir Henry St. George, Richmond Herald, were
royally rewarded by her Majesty, with the gift of a thousand French Crowns.
He was also employed to attend upon his Majesty's Embassage which was sent in
the year 1629. unto the French king Lewis the thirteenth, and at the
Ceremonies done thereat, he there performed his office in his Coat of Arms, as
appears in a French relation lately printed; at his return from thence the
King rewarded him with a Chain of gold of good value, and a Medalle of his
pourtraiture: And further gave him his Royal letters Mandatory, unto all his
Officers and Subjects therein, signifying that (let me use part of the Kings
own words) le Sieur Guillaum^ le Neue Escuyer Herault Darmes du Roy de la
grand Bretagne (nostre tr^scher, et tresame bon friar et beau friar) par luy
envoye verse nous pour fair sa dicte charge D'Herault D'armes aux Ceremonies du
serment de la paix faicte enter nous and nostre dict friar, de la quelle il
sest dignement acquit^^ a nostre contentement, seu retournant verse son Maistre.
Nous voulo^s, nous mandons et tresexpressement enioignons par an presents
signees de nostre main, etc. Commanding by the said Instrument all his said
Officers and Subjects to give the said Herald all manner of aid, and
assistance in his return, or not to molest or trouble him in his free passage
or transportation of any of his goods. And therein also prayed, and required
all Princes and States to do the like, as a due unto Heralds so employed: And
as they would have him to do the like at their request. But no earthly powers
can command the merciless ragings of the Sea. For the said Herald in his
return was ship-wracked upon the coast of Dover, and very dangerously escaped
with the loss of most part of his goods; excepting the foresaid Chain and
Medalle which after two days remaining in the sea was washed up on shore, even
in view of the place where he then remained.

In this Catalogue I observe that Thomas Holinsworth, York Herald, and
William Wriothesley, York Herald, (son of the foresaid Sir John Wriothesley
Garter) and others are omitted, which with all other omissions in this
particular discourse, I refer to the judicious reformation of the College of
Heralds.

whose arrival, the State there made great and large expressions of their
joyful hearts for such welcome tidings, worthily receiving and bountifully
rewarding the said Officer of Arms.

Noblemen and Peers of this Land, in ancient time had their Heralds peculiar
unto themselves, says Milles. For Chester the Herald, and Falco the
Pursuiuant, lived at the command of the Prince of Wales, and served him:
Humfrey Duke of Gloucester, and Earl of Penbroke, had the Herald Penbrooke, his
domestical Servant. Richard also Duke of Gloucester, having now obtained the
kingdom, would needs have his Herald Gloucester to be called King of Arms for
all Wales. Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk, retained Suffolk Herald, and
Marleon Pursuiuant. The Marquess of Dorcester, kept Groby Herald. The Earl
of Northumberland, Northumberland Herald, and Esperance Pursuiuant. Arthur
Plantaginet Viscount Lisle, took unto himself Lisle Pursuiuant, and Baron
Hastings, Hasting Pursuiuant. But the condition of the Servant is made better
by the dignity of his Lord and Master, so these forenamed Heralds lived not
with like authority or privileges with the Kings.

And here now give me leave to speak a little more of the Aetymologie,
Antiquity, and dignity of Heralds in general.

Herald, The Aetymologie, Antiquity, and Dignity of Heralds.
Herold, or Herault, dicitur quasi Herus altus, a high Master: For this
Officer was of great authority amongst the Romans, who plurally called them
Feciales, a faciendo, quod belli pacisque faciendae penes cos ius erat, or
Fediales a faedere faciendo. And so with us the word signifies an Officer at
Arms, whose function is to denounce war, to proclaim peace, or otherwise to
be employed by the King, in martial messages, or other business; and so they
are called Internuncij vel pacis, vel belli ferendi. Messengers to carry and
offer either war or peace.

Heralt, says Verstegan, in the Title of Honors and Offices, is merely a
Teutonic or Duytch word, and in that tongue and no other, the true Aetymologie
thereof is only to be found.

To begin then with the first syllable thereof, which is Here, though in
composition abridged to Her, it is the true and ancient Teutonic word for an
Army, the same that Exercitus is in Latin; and in that sense it is yet used
in Germany. And whereas the Germans do now use Here also for Lord, yet
anciently they so used it not. And although the Teutonic be more mixed with
other strange languages; yet this word Here, as they use it for Lord or master,
has crept into their language from Herus in Latin, after that the Latin
tongue became known unto them.

A Healt in the Teutonick, is a most courageous person, a champion, or an
especial challenger to a fight or combat, of the weapon that such sometime
most used, called a Healtbard, because it was borne by a Healt, we yet, though
corruptly, retain the name of Holbard, and the Netherlands make it Heilbard.

Here-healt by abbreuiation Heralt, as also Herald, does rightly signify, the
Champion of the army. And (growing to be a name of Office) he that has in the
army the especial charge to challenge unto battle or combat: in which sense
our name of Herald does nearest approach unto Fecialis in Latin, as I have
touched before.

Heralds Priests Rosinus Ant. Romans li. 3. c. 21.
The Feciales amongst the Romans, says one, were Priests. For Numa Pompilius
(who flourished circa ann. mundi 3283.) the second King of the Romans, divided
the institution of divine honor into eight parts, and so instituted and
ordained eight several orders of Priests; and endowed the College of these
Feciales or Heralds with the seventh part of this his sacred constitution.
Their College at Rome was composed of twenty Heralds, chosen out of ancient
and eminent families, the chief whereof (for excellence) was called Pater
Patratus, because by being chief of that company, he ought to have children,
and his own Father yet living. Their chief office was, To take care that the
Romans did not commence, and make unjust war against any confederate City,
and that if any such a city had committed any thing against the conditions of
the confederacy, truce, and intercourse, then they were to go as Ambassadors,
first to challenge their right in mild words; which if denied, then to
proclaim war, Neque iustum aliquod bellum fore censebatur, nisi id per
Feciales esset indictum: Neither was any war thought to be just and lawful,
but that which was denounced by these Feciales, or Heralds.

Heralds of France of noble descent.
In France (says Andrew Favine) Heralds have ever been in high esteem, and
not only the King of Arms, Mont-ioy, S. Denis, but also the other Heralds,
and Pursuiuants, were of noble extraction: and Mont-ioy could not be admitted
without making proof of his Nobleness by three races, as well of his Fathers
stock, as by his mothers side. There was two thousand pounds of rents in Lands
and free tenure, allowed for the said Mont-ioy particularly, and a thousand
pounds of annual pension, besides other rights. As for the other Heralds, they
have a thousand pounds in pension, with other rights and privileges.

Now for such rights and privileges as were granted to kings of Arms and
Heralds, some do ascribe them to the King and Emperor Charlemaigne: others to
Alexander the Great of Macedon, and others to the Emperor of Germany, Charles
king of Bohemia, fourth of that name, nourished from his youth in the Court of
the Father of Cheualrie, Philip de Valoys, king of France, sixth and last of
that name, as here follows the tenure in these words.

The Privileges granted to Kings, and Heralds of Arms, translated out of the
French in the Theater of Honor.
My Soldiers, you are and shall be called Heralds, Companions for kings, and
Judges of crimes committed by Noblemen; and arbitratours of their quarrels and
differences. You must live hereafter exempted from going any more to war, or
military factions. Council kings for the best, the benefit of the weal
public, and for their Honor and Royal dignity. Correct all matters vile
and dishonest: favor widows, succor orphans, and defend them from all
violence. Assist with your counsel such Princes and Lords in whose Courts you
shall abide, and freely and without fear, demand of them whatsoever is
needful for you, as food, raiment, and defrayings. If any one of them shall
deny you, let him be infamous, without glory or honor, and reputed as
criminal of high treason. In like manner also, have you an especial care, to
keep your selves from vilifying your noble exercise, and the Honor wherewith
you ought to come near us at all times. See there be no entrance into Princes
Courts, either of drunkenness, ill speaking, flattery, babbling indiscreetly,
ianglery, buffonnerie, and such other vices, which soil and shame the
reputation of men. Give good example every where, maintain equity, and
repair the wrongs done by great men to their inferiors. Remember what
privileges we have granted you, in recompense of the painful trauells in
war, which you endured with us. And let not the Honors which we have
bestowed on you, be converted to blame and infamy by dishonest living: the
punishment whereof we reserve to our self, and to the Kings of France our
Successors.

Seven Danish Kings, besides some of Norway, and Sweden, have had for their
proper appellation the name of Herald, or Harold, which is all one with Heralt,
says Verstegan. So honorable was it accounted of in old time, that so many
Kings thereby were called, in regard as it appears, that themselves might be
honored and respected as the most courageous of the army.

Heralds (says Stow) (out of an old History, Stow in the life of Brute.
written above six hundred years since, which he found in the Reuestrie or
Treasury of Saint Paul's Church) be they which our Elders were wont to call
Heroes, that is to say, those which were greater, or surpassing all men in
Majesty, and yet inferior to the Gods. For, whom the people of antiquity did
perceive to be notable, and surmounting all others in his acts and feats,
renowned in virtues, and friendly or gracious unto them; him would they
magnify, and exalt in the highest degree, and as it were, with their good
words make him cousin to Jove the omnipotent. Placing such amongst the Gods, if
it so were, that they had wrought some miraculous feate above the common course
of Nature. But if there were no such miraculous or wonderful deeds, but that
through their virtues they seemed wonderful and honorable, then thought they
to call such persons, not altogether Gods, nor yet simply men, but invented
out a mean word and name for them, calling them Heroes, as it were halfe-gods,
and of this word Heroes, or Heroes, grows by corruption of use this name
Herald.

In the same place he proves that Heralds here in England were as ancient as
the days of Brute (who flourished above eleven hundred years before the birth
of Christ) who bare (says he) Gules, two Lions rampant, endorsed Or,
according to this piece out of Hardings Chronicle.

The Arms of Brute.
He bare of Goulis two liones of gold
Country Rampant, with gold only crouned,
Which kings of Troy in bataill barefull bold.
Neither can it be justly said, for all this, that Heralds were not known nor
in request in this kingdom, but since the time of Brute. For even from the
instant, that the descendants of Adam were distinguished into Nobles and
Yeomen; there have been combats, battles, and encounters, and consequently
Heralds, derived from the body of Nobility.

Now at the length let me turn back to the foresaid defunct Sir John
Wriothesley, to whom, and to the rest of the Kings Heralds and Pursuiuants of
Arms; king Richard the third in the first year of his reign, granted and
gave by his letters Patents, Cold Harber the Heralds College.
all that message with the appurtenances called Cold-Harber, in the Parish of
All Saints the little in London; freeing them a Subsidijs, theolonijs, and
omnibus Reipub. muneribus: Dated at Westminster the second of March, without
fine or fee. How the said Heralds departed therewith (says Stow) I have not
read: but in the reign of Henry the eight, the Bishop of Durhams house, near
Charing Cross, being taken into the Kings hand; Cuthbert Tunstall, Bishop of
Durham, was lodged in this Cold-Harber.

But in my judgment I still digress, or at leastwise drive off my Reader over
long from the knowledge of the time of this man's death; which I cannot set
down neither certainly: yet I gather by circumstances, that it should be about
the latter end of the reign of king Hen. the seventh.

Eleanor Lady Wriothesley.
Here lies buried by her husband, Eleanor, the second wife of the foresaid Sir
John Wriothesley.

In this Parish and partly (as I take it) in Saint Peter's the little, is a
fair house, sometime (belonging to the Stanleys; upon the outward wall whereof
are embossed the Arms, or rather, if you will, the legs of the Isle of Man;
for that the Stanleys, honored with the title of Earls of Darby, were
commonly called Kings of Man. This house was built by Thomas Stanley, first of
that surname, Earl of Darby, and so for a long time it was called Darbie
House, but at length it being in the tenure of Sir Richard Sackuile knight,
fallen by morgage unto him, for which morgage, Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolk,
out of his affection to the office of Arms, satisfied the said Sir Richard;
who thereupon past it over to Q. Mary, and at the instant request of the said
Duke, she by her Charter granted it to Sir Gilbert Dethicke, as then Garter,
principal King of Arms, who lies buried in this Church; Thomas Hauley,
Clarencieux, king of Arms of the south parts, William Haruey, Norroy, king of
Arms of the north parts; and to the other Heralds and Pursuiuants of Arms

your Majesty, what fruits have spronge of my laboriouse journey and costly
enterprise, both roted upon your infinite goodness and liberalite, qualitees,
right highly to be esteemed in all Princes, and most specially in you, as
naturally your own well known proprietes.

The works of ancient Writers saved and conserved.
First I have conserved many good authors, the which otherwise had been like to
have perished, to no small incommodite of good letters. Of the which, part
remain in the most magnificent libraries of your royal Palaces. Part also
remain in my custody, whereby I trust right shortly, so to describe your most

delicately clothed in purpure, her written veritees can scant find a Reader.
That all the world shall evidently perceive, that no particular region, may
justly be more extolled, than yours for true nobility and virtues at all
points renoumed.

Farther, more part of the exemplaries, curiously sought by me, and fortunately
found in sundry places of this your dominion, has been emprinted in Germany,
and now be in the presses chefely of Frobenus, that not alonly the Germans,
but also the Italianes themself, that count as the Greeks ded full arrogantly,
all other Nations to be barbarouse and unlettered, saving their own, shall

And that profit has risen by the aforesaid journey, in bringing full many
things to light, as concerning the usurped autorite of the Bishop of Rome and
his accomplices, to the manifest and violent derogation of Kingly dignite: I
refer my self most humbly to your most prudent, learned, and high judgment,

Low Countries.


to discern my diligence in the long Volume, wherein I have made answer for
the defense of your supreme dignity, al only lening to the strong pillor of
holy scripture, against the whole College of the Romanists, cloking their
crafty affections and arguments, under the name of one poor Pighius of
Vltraiect in Germany, and standing to them as to their only anchor, hold
against tempests that they know will arise, if truth may be by licens let in
to have a voice in the general counsel.

Yet herin only I have not pytched the supreme work of my labor, whereunto
your grace, most like a kinglye Patron of all good lernyng, ded animate me. But
also considering and expending with my self, how great a number of excellent
godly wits and writers, learned with the best, as the times served, has been
in this your region; Not only at such times as the Roman Emperors had
recourse to it, but also in those days that the Saxons prevailed of the
Britains, Lelands affection toward his Country.
and the Normans of the Saxons, could not but with a fervent zele, and honest
courage, commend them to memory Else, alas, like to have been perpetually

Wherefore I knowing by infinite variety of books, and assiduouse reading of

who has been learned, and who has written from time to time in this realm,
have digested into four books, the names of them, with their lives and
monuments of lerning. And to them added this title. De viris illustribus,

more exspaciated in this camp, then they ded, as in a thing that desired to be
somewhat at large, and to have ornature. The first book beginning at the
Druides, is deducted unto the time of the coming of S. Augustine into England.
The second is from the time of Augustine, unto the aduente of the Normans. The
third from the Normans, to the end of the most honorable reign of the
mighty, famous, and prudent Prince, Henry the seventh your Father. The fourth
begins with the name of your Majesty, whose glory in lerning, is to the
world so clearly known, that though emonge the lives of other learned men, I
have accurately celebrated the names of Bladud, Learned Princes.
Mulmutius, Constantinus Magnus, Sigebert, Alfridus, Alfridus magnus,

Ethelward, second son to Alfride the great, Humfryde, Duke of Gloucester, and
Tipetote Earl of Worcestre, yet conferred with your grace, they serve as small
lights (if I may freely say my judgment, your high modesty not offended) in
respect of the day star.

The wits of the British and English writers exercised in all kinds of good
literature.
Now farther to insinuate to your grace, of what matters the Writers, whose
lives I have congested into four books, has treated of. I may right boldly
say; that beside the cognicion of the four tongues, in the which, part of them
has excelled, that there is no kind of liberal science, or any feate
concerning learning, in the which they have not showed certain arguments o^
great felicity of wit. Yea, and concerning the interpretation of holy
Scripture, both after the ancient form, and sens the scholasticall trade, they
have reigned as in a certain excellency.

A wonderful great number of Historiographers of British affairs.
And as touching historical knowledge, there has been to the number of a full

faith, would to God with like eloquence, perscribed the acts of your noble
predecessors, and the fortunes of this your Realm, so incredibly great, that
he that has not seane, and thoroughly read their works, can little pronounce
in this part.

Wherefore, after that I had perpended the honest and profitable studies of these
Historiographers, I was totally enflamed with a love, to see thoroughly all
those parts of this your opulent and ample realm, Lelands laborious journey
throughout all England.
that I had read of in the aforsaid Writers. In so much that, all my other
occupacions intermitted, I have so traueled in your dominions, both by the sea
coasts and the middle parts, sparing neither labor nor costs, by the space of
these six years past, that there is almost neither cape nor baye, haven,
creke, or pere, river, or confluence of rivers, breches, washes, lakes, meres,
fenny waters, mountains, valleys, mores, hethes, forestes, woods, cities,
burges, castles, principal manor places, monasteries, and colleges; but I have
seane them, and noted in so doing a whole world of things very memorable.

Thus instructed, I trust shortly to see the time, that like as Carolus Magnus
had among his treasures, three large notable tables of silver, richly enameled;
one of the site and description of Constantinople, The description of all
England in a quadrate table of silver.
another of the site and figure of the magnificente City of Rome, and the
third of descrypcyon of the world. So shall your Majesty have this your world
and impery of England, so set forth in a quadrate table of silver, if God send
me life to accomplish my beginning, that your Grace shall have ready knowledge
at the first sight of many right delectable, fruitful, and necessary
pleasures, by contemplacion thereof, as often as occasion shall move you to the
sight of it.

And because that it may be more permanent, and farther known, then to have it
engraued in silver or brass; A Book of the Topographie of England.
I entend by the leave of God, within the space of twelve months following,
such a description to make of your realm in writing, that it shall be no
mastery after, for the Grauer or Painter to make the like by a perfect example.

Yea, and to wade farther in this matter, where as now almost no man can well
guess at the shadow of the ancient names of havens, rivers, promontories,
hills, The names of several nations, Cities, and great towns, etc. of
Britain in old time, such as Caesar, Tacitus, Ptolimey, and other Authors have
made mention of, restored together with the later and modern names.
woods, Cities, Towns, Castles, and varyete of kinds of people, that Caesar,
Liui, Strabo, Diodorus, Fabius, Pictor, Pomponius Mela, Plinius, Cornelius
Tacitus, Ptolomeus, Sextus Rufus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Solinus, Antoninus, and
diverse other make mencyon of. I trust so to open this wyndow, that the light
shall be seen, so long, that is to say, by the space of a whole thousand
years stopped up, and the old glory of your renowned Britayne to reflorish
through the world.

This done, I have matter of plenty, already prepared for this purpose, that is
to say, to write an History, to the which I entend to ascribe this title, De
Antiquitate Britannica, or else Civilis Historia. And this work I entend to
divide into so many books, as there be Shyres in England, and shires and great
dominions in Wales. So that I esteem that this Volume will enclude a fifty
books, Of the Antiquity of Britain, or of Civil History fifty Books.
whereof each one severally shall contain the beginnings, increases, and
memorable acts of the chief Towns and Castles of the Province allotted to it.

Then I entend to distribute into six books, such matter as I have already
collected, Six Books of the Islands adjacent to England.
concerning the Isles adjacent to your noble realm, and under your subieccyon.
Whereof three shall be of these Isles, Vecta, Mona, and Menavia, sometime
kyngedomes.

And to superadde a work as an ornament and a right comely garlande to the
enterprises aforesaid, I have selected stuff to be distributed into three
books, Three books of the Nobility of Britain.
the which I purpose thus to entitle, De Nobilitate Britannica. Whereof the
first shall declare the names of Kings and Queen's, with their children, Dukes,
Earls, Lords, Capitaynes and rulers in this realm to the coming of the
Saxons and their Conquest. The second shall be of the Saxons. The third from
the Normans to the reygne of your most noble grace, descending lineally of the
Brytayne, Saxon, and Norman kings. So that all noble men shall clearly
perceyve their lyneall parentele.

Now, His conclusion a delectabili and vtili.
if it shall be the pleasure of Almighty God, that I may lyve to perform these
things that be already begone, and in a great forwardness, I trust that this
your realm shall so well be known, ones painted with his native colors, that
the renown thereof shall give place to the glory of no other region. And my
great labors and costs, procedynge from the most habundant fountain of your
infinite goodness toward me your pore scholar and most humble servaunt, shall
be euydently seane to have not only pleased, but also profyted the studyouse,
gentill, and equal reders. This is the brief declaracyon of my laboriouse
journey, taken by mocyon of your highness, so much studying at all hours,
about the fruitful preferment of good letters, and ancient virtues.

Christ continue your most royal estate and the prosperyte, Commune vo^^^
with succession in kyngely dignite, of your dear and worthylye beloved son
Prince Edward, granting you a number of Pryncely sons, by the most
gracious, benygne, and modest Lady your Queen Cataryne.

Johannes Leylandus Antiquarius.
John Bale, in his declaration upon this Treatise, says that the next year
after that Leyland presented this New-yeares Gift to king Henry, the said king
deceased, and Leyland by a most pitiful accident fell besides his wits; which
was the cause (belike) that these his works were never imprinted; howsoever at
this day, the written copies thereof are in some private men's custody; which
learned Camden saw, as he himself acknowledges, when he compiled that
matchless Chorographicall description of Great Britain.

But those learned Authors which Leyland gathered together in his journey, and
which he conserved to augment the Kings Libraries and his own; are, I doubt,
by the iniquity of times, quite lost and perished. And here I might take
occasion to speak of the great spoil of old Books, and all other reverend
Antiquities at and upon the suppression of Abbeyes, and reformation of
Religion. As also of the due praise belonging to such men in these days, who
like Sir Robert Cotton with labor and charges, Sir Rob. Cotton knight and
Baronet.
collect, and safely preserve these ancient Monuments of learning for the
public good and commodity of the whole kingdom. But of this when I come to
that inestimable rich Treasury, Sir Tho. Bodley knights.
that famous and renowned Library in the University of Oxford, whose
principal Founder was Sir Thomas Bodley knight, deceased.

To return then to our Antiquarie Leyland; Many other works, (says Bale, in
the foresaid declaration) has Leyland written, of whom some are emprinted, as
the Assertion of king Arthure, the Birth of Prince Edward, the Song of the
Swanne, the decease of Sir Thomas Wiet, the winning of Bullein, and the
commendation of Peace. Some are not yet printed, as his Colleccyons of the
Bishops of Brytayne, of the Vniuersytees of the same, of the orygynoll and
increase of good learnynges there: Of his Epigrammes and Epitaphs, and the life
of king Sygebert, with many other more.

He died frantic the 18. day of April, Anno redemptionis humanae, 1552. Of
whom this Ogdoasticke following was composed, either by himself, as the style
shows, or by some other in his name, says Pitseus.

Pit. Aetas 16.
Quantum Rhenano debet Germania docto,
Tantum debebit terra Britanna mihi.
Ille suae gentis ritus, and nomina prisca,
Aestiuo fecit lucidiora die.
Ipse antiquarum rerum quoque magnus amator,
Ornabo patriae lumina clara meae.
Quae cum prodierint niueis inscripta tabellis,
Tum testes nostrae sedulitatis erunt:
These verses were annexed to his Monument, as I have it by tradition.

Io. Leland the Elder.
This our Leland is called by writers Lelandus junior, in regard of another John
Leland, who flourished in the time of king Henry the sixth; taught a School in
Oxford, and writ certain Treatises of the Art of Grammar. Which Leland, says
Pits, was tum in versu, tum in prosa multo elegantior, and in omni Latinitate
purior, tersior, nitidior, quam ferebat illius at at is communis consuetudo: As
well in verse as prose, much more elegant, and in all the Latin tongue more
pure, polisht, and neat, then the custom of that age did commonly affoard.
Whereupon this riming Hexameter was made to his commendation.

Vt Rosa slos slorum, sic Leland Grammaticorum.
But to take my leave of both these Lelands, and go forward to what ancient
Inscriptions I have sometime found in this Church.

Cauendish is a Town or Village in Suffolk, wherein that valiant Gentleman
John Cauendish Esquire, who slew that Arch-Rebell Watt Tyler, Anno Reg. Regis,
Ric: 2.4. was borne; Lib. Esiens. in bib. Cott.
which fact was not long unrevenged, for in the same year, the Rebels of
Norfolk and Suffolk, under the conduct of their Captain, Sir John Wraw (a
detestable Priest) took Sir John Cauendish knight, cousin to the foresaid John,
chief Justice of the Kings Bench, and beheaded him, together with Sir John of
Cambridge, Prior of Saint Edmundsbury, whose heads they set on the Pillory in
the Market place.

Here restyth the body of William Burd Esquyr, Will. Burd Clarke of the Pipe.
late Clark of the Pipe and Privy Seal, which paid the general tribute of
Nature, divided from the mundane vexations by natural death the xv day of
August, the xxi year of king Henry the eight.

Cowell. lit. C.
Clarke of the Pipe (says the Interpreter) is an Officer in the Kings
Exchequer, who having all accounts and debts due unto the king, delivered, and
drawn down out of the Remembrancers Offices, charge them down into the
great Roll. Who also writes summons unto the Shiriffe to levy the said debts,
upon the goods and chattels of the said debtors: and if they have no goods,
then does he draw them down to the Lord Treasurers Remembrancer, to write
Extreats against their Land. The ancient Reuenew of the Crown remains in
charge before him, and he sees the same answered by the Fermers and Shiriffes
to the king. He makes a charge to all Shiriffes of their summons of the Pipe
and Greenewax, and sees it answered upon their accounts. He has the
engrossing of all Leasses of the Kings lands: and it is likely that it was at
the first called, and still has denomination of Pipe, and Clarke of the Pipe,
and Pipe Office, because their Records that are registered in their smallest
Rolls, are altogether like Organe Pipes: but their great Roll called the Great
Roll, Ann. 37. Ed. 3. ca. 4. is of another form.

Clarke of the Privy Seal.
Clericus Priuati Sigilii, or Clarke of the privy Seal, is an Officer
(whereof there be four in number) that attends the Lord Keeper of the privy
Seal, or if there be none such, upon the principal Secretary, writing and
making out all things, that be sent by warrant from the Signet to the Privy
Seal, and are to be passed to the Great Seal; as also to make out (as they
are termed) Privy Seals, upon any especial occasion of his Majesty's
affairs, for loan or lending of money, or such like. Of this Officer and his
function, you may read the Statute, Ann. 27. Hen. 8. cap. 11.

Io. Hartishorne Sergeant at Arms, and Agnes his wife.
Hic iacet Johannes Hartishorne, quondam Seruiens Domini Regis ad Arma qui

M.cccc.

The office of Sergeants at Arms is to attend the person of the King, to
arrest Traitors, or great men that do or are like to contemn messengers of
ordinary condition for other causes; and to attend the Lord high Steward of
England, The office of Sergeant at Arms. Cowell lit. ^.
sitting in Judgment upon any Traitor, and such like. Of these by the Statute
Ann. 13. Ric. 2. cap. 6. there may not be above thirty in the Realm. There be
also two of these Sergeants of the Parliament, one of the upper, and another of
the lower house, whose office seems for the execution of such commandments,
especially touching the apprehension of any offender, as either house shall
think good to enjoin them. There is one Sergeant at Arms that belongs to
the Chancerie, who is called Sergeant of the Mace, as the rest may be, because
they carry Maces by their office: He of the Chancerie attends the Lord
Chancellor or Lord Keeper in that Court. Another in like manner attends the
Lord Treasurer.

In this Church was sometime (says Stow) a Brotherhood of Saint Fabian and

Nurse, to Robert Cawood (Clarke of the Pipe, who lies buried in this Church,
but of whom no remembrance is remaining) and Thomas Smith, to found the same a
Fraternity, perpetually to have a Master and two Custos with Brethren and

his Lady lie buried under a fair Tomb, kept well in repair, in a Chapel on

There remains in one of the windows of this Church, a beautiful
representation of a man in his complete armor, with his coat armor on his
breast, and his wives portraiture on the other side, with her own honorarie
ensigns, also in nature of an empalement with his: which by the inscription
well answering to the exoticke form of their attiring, appears to have been
set up in memory of Adrian D'Ewes, a lineall descendant of the ancient family
of Des Ewes, Dynasts or Lords of the dition of Kessell in the Duchy of
Gelderland, who came first thence into England in the time of King H. 8. (when
that Duchy had been much ruined, wasted, and depopulated by the intestine
wars there raised, and continued between Charles, Eliae Reusneri Basil.

Clarke of the Crown, is a Clarke or Officer in the Kings Bench, whose function
is to frame, read, and record all Indictments against Traitors, Felons, and
other offenders, there arraigned, upon any public crime. He is otherwise
called Clarke of the Crown office. And Ann. 2. Hen. 4. cap. 10. he is called
Clarke of the Crown of the Kings Bench. The reason of his denomination is
because he reads and records Indictments against Traitors, Felons, etc. which
are against the Kings Crown and dignity.

Many Monuments of the Dead in Churches in and about this City of London, as
also in some places of the country, are covered with seats or pewes, made
high and easy for the Parishioners to sit or sleep in, a fashion of no long
continuance, and worthy of reformation.

Of the Diocese of London, the Battles therein fought, and of the Burialls of
the Dead slain in those terrible conflicts.
NOw as I have before spoken somewhat of the Bishoprics of Cant. and
Rochester, so let me here speak a little of this Diocese of London, which
extends so far in circuit, as the Site of the East or Middle Saxons
kingdom anciently comprised; which was bounded on the East with the Ocean; on
the South with the Thames, on the West with the Colne, and on the North with
the River Stowre; within the limits whereof, Midlesex, Essex, and a part of
Hertfordshire are contained. The glory of which Diocese is principally
Midlesex, in regard of the far-famed City of London, the Metropolis of England
(of which I have spoken before) and the chief seat of her sacred Bishops: as
also in regard of the River of Thames, the king of all our Rivers. Of whom, and
of the rare prospects he views in his passage between Windsore and London
Bridge, a late Poet thus versifies.

M. Drayton, Pol. 17. Song.
But now this mighty Flood, upon his voyage pressed
(That found how with his strength, his beauties still increast,
From where, brave Windsore stood on tiptoe to behold
The fair and goodly Thames, so far as ere he could,
With kingly houses crowned, of more then earthly pride,
Upon his either Banks as he along does glide)
With wonderful delight, does his long course pursue,
Where Otlands, Hampton Court, and Richmond he does view.
Then Westminster the next great Tames does entertain,
That vaunts her Palace large, and her most sumptuous Fane:
The Lands tribunal seat that challenges for hers,
The crowning of our kings, their famous Sepulchers.
Then goes he on along by that more beauteous Strand,
Expressing both the wealth and bravery of the Land.
(So many sumptuous Bowres, within so little space
The All-beholding Sun scarce sees in all his race)
And on by London leads, which like a Crescent lies,
London lying like a half moon.
Whose windows seem to mock the Star-befreckled skies.
Besides her rising Spyres, so thick themselves that show,
As do the bristling reeds, within her banks that grow.
There sees his crowded Wharfes, and people-pestred shores,
London Bridge the Crown of Tames.
His bosom ouerspread with shoales of laboring ores:
With that most costly Bridge, that does him most renown,
By which he clearly puts all other Rivers down.
Camd. in Mid.
Midlesex (says Camden) is for air passing temperate, and for soil fertile,
with sumptuous houses, and pretty Towns on all sides pleasantly beautified: and
every where offers to the view many things memorable: Whereupon a Germane
Poet thus versified.

Tot campos, syluas, tot regia tecta, tot hortos
Artifici dextra excultos, tot vidimus arces,
Vt nunc Ansonio Tamisis cum Tibride certet.
So many fields, and pleasant woods, so many Princely Bowres,
And Palaces we saw besides, so many stately towers,
So many Gardens trimly dressed by curious hand which are,
That now with Roman Tiberis, the Tames may well compare.
This County is comprised within short bounds, being in length, where it is the
longest, not passing twenty miles, and in the narrowest place not passing
twelve miles.

The length thereof (says Speed) extended from Stratford in the East, Speed of
Mi^.
to Morehall upon Colne in the West, is by measure nineteen English miles; and
from South Mims in the North to his Majesty's Manor of Hampton Court in the
South, are little above sixteen miles: the whole circumference extending to
ninety.

In form it is almost square, for air passing temperate, for soil abundantly
fertile; and for pasturage and grain of all kinds, yielding the best, so that
the wheat of this County has served a long time for the Manchet to our Princes
table.

It lies seated in a vale, most wholesome and rich, having some hills also, and
them of good ascent; from whose tops the prospect of the whole is seen like
unto Zoar in Egypt, Gen 14.10.
or rather like a Paradise and Garden of God.

Five Princely houses inheritable to the English Crown, are seated in this
Shire, which are, Enfield, Hanworth, Whitehall, S James, and Hampton Court,
Hampton Court.
a City rather in show, then the Palace of a Prince: and for stately port and
gorgeous building not inferior to any in Europe.

A work of admirable magnificence (says Camden) built out of the ground by
Thomas Wolsey Cardinal, Camd in Mid.
in ostentation of his riches, when for very pride, being otherwise a most
prudent man, he was not able to manage his mind. But it was made an Honor,
enlarged and finished by king Henry the eight so amply, as it contains within
it five several inner Courts, passing large, environed with very fair
buildings wrought right curiously, and goodly to behold. Of which Leyland
writes thus.

Est locus insolito rerum splendore superbus,
Alluiturque vaga Tamisini fluminis vnda,
Nomine ab antiquo iam tempore dictus Avona.
Hic Rex Henricus taleis Octauius aedes
Erexit, qualeis toto Sol aureus orb
Non vidit.
A stately place for rare and glorious show,
There is which Tames with wandering stream does dowsse;
Times past, by name of Avon men it knew:
Here Henry The Eighth of that name built an house
So sumptuous, as that on such an one
(Seek through the world) the bright Sun never shone.
And another in the Nuptial Poem of Tame and Isis.

Alluit Hamptonum celebrem quae laxior vrbis

C^sar. Comm^nt. lib. 5.
The ancient Inhabitants of Middlesex, as also of Essex, were called by Caesar,
the Trinobantes, whom he names to be the most puissant in the Land, with whom
he and his army had many bloody bickerings nere and upon the banks of the
river of Tames, Burials near Stanes.
wherein many were slain on either side, which lie interred in the fields
twixt Shepperton and Stanes.

Spec. Brit.
Some affirm Stanes (says Norden) to be so called of the Stakes, called Goway
Stakes, which were fixed in the Thames by the Britons, to prevent Julius Caesar
of passing his army through the river. Lib. 1. cap. 2.
Of which, and of the conflicts and skirmishes betwixt the Britains and
Romans, thus venerable Bede writes.

Caesar's Horsemen at the first encounter, were overthrown of the Britains,
and Labienus one of his Colonels slain. At the second encounter, with great
loss of his Army, he put the Britains to flight. From thence he went unto the
river of Tames, which men say cannot be waded over, but in one place: where on
the farther side, a great number of the Britains warded the banks, under
Cassibelan their Captain, who had stuck the bottom of the river, and the
banks also thick of great stakes, whereof certain remnants unto this day are
to be seen, of Piles, of the bigness of a man's thigh, covered with lead,
sticking fast in the bottom of the river; which when the Romans had espied,
and escaped, the Britains, not able to withstand the violence of the Roman
Legions, hid themselves in the woods, out of the which they often breaking
forth, greatly endamaged the Army of the Romans.

Burials near Brainford.
In and about Brainford or Brentford, the bodies of many a warlike Commander and
expert Soldier lie inhumed, which were slain in that fierce and terrible
battle, betwixt Edmund Ironside, and the Danes, which he had driven from the
siege of London; at a place now called Turnham Green, thereunto adjoining; in
which battle he gave the Danes a bloody overthrow, losing few of his army,
save such as were drowned in the riner of Tames as they passed over.

In the year, 7141. and the day being the Paschall, whereon Christ rose from
death, (which with due reverence is celebrated in all the Christian world) upon
Gladmore heath, half a mile from Barnet, was foughten a most fierce and cruel
Battle, betwixt King Edward the fourth, and Richard Neuill the great Earl of
Warwick, (the Mars and Make-King of England) contending to reestablish that
holy, and yet unfortunate, King Henry the sixth in his regal authority.

In this battle upon King Edwards part were slain, Burials of the dead
slain at Barnet field.
Humfrey Bourchier Lord Cromwell, Henry Bourchier, son and heir to the Lord
Barners, both buried at Westminster. In the quarrel of King Henry, were slain
the foresaid Richard Neuill Earl of Warwick, and John Neuill, Marquess
Montacute his brother, both buried at Bisham Abbey in Barkeshire; the bodies of
many others of the Nobility and Gentry, on both parties which perished in
this unnatural conflict, had Christian burial in the Friar Augustines Church
London. The common Soldiers, as also many Commanders, were buried upon the
same Plain where the foresaid battle was stricken: to whose memory a
Chapel was built upon the said Plain, and a Priest appointed to say Mass
for their souls, as the doctrine went in those days.

Upon both sides of common Soldiers, there died that holy Easter day, as then
the 14. of April, says Ed. Hall, ten thousand: four thousand, says Io.
Stow, and Rob. Fabian says, (far less) fifteen hundred, so uncertain, as
I have said before, is the number of the dead slain in battle.

Howsoever a part only of Hertfordshire is comprised within this Diocese, yet
give me leave to say somewhat in this place, Camd. in Heart.
of the whole County: A rich Country (says Clarencieux) in corn Fields,
Pastures, Meadows, Woods, Groves, and clear riuerets. And for ancient towns
it may contend with the neighbors, even for the best. For, there is scarcely
another in all England that can show more good towns in so small a compass;
the whole circumference of the Shire being but about an hundred and thirty
miles.

In this County, and in the town of S. Albans, two mortal and bloody battles
of Englands civil dissentions, The first battle of S. Albans.
have been fought. The first whereof chanced the 24. of May, Anno 1455. by
Richard, Duke of York, with his associates, the Earls of Warwick and
Salisbury, and Lords of Fawconbridge, and Cobham, against King Henry the sixth.
In whose defense, Edmund, Duke of Somerset, Henry, Earl of Northumberland, and
John, Lord Clifford, with five thousand more, lost their lives, the King
himself was wounded in the neck with an arrow, the Duke of Buckingham, and
Lord Sudley, in their faces; Humfrey Earl Stafford in his right hand, and the
Earl Dorset almost slain. On the Dukes part, only six hundred were slain.
Of which battle, and of the timorous flight of the Soldiers on the Kings
party, the learned Abbot of Saint Albans, John Wheathamstead, who lived in
those days, writes thus.

The second battle of S. Albans.
The second battle fought in this town of Saint Albans, was by Queen
Margaret, against the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the Earls of Warwick
and Arundell, that by force kept with them, the King her husband, with whom by
constraint he held, and on their side fought until the field was lost, and
Lords fled, when with great joy he was received by his Queen, and young son
Prince Edward. This battle sell the 17. of February* being Shrouesunday.

Of this town, and of these two battles, thus Camden writes in a more succinct
and serious style.

Camd. in Heart.
As Antiquity consecrated this place (says he) to be an Altar of Religion: so
Mars also may seem to have destined it for the very plot of bloody battle
For, to let other particulars go by, when England under the two houses of
Lancaster and York, bereft, as it were, of vital breath, was ready through a
civil war to sink down and fall in a swoune: the chief Captains on both
sides joined battle twice with reciprocal variety of fortune in the very
town. First, Richard Duke of York gave the Lancastrians here a sore
overthrow, took King Henry the sixth captive, and slew many honorable
personages. Four years after, the Lancastrians under the conduct of Queen
Margaret, won here the field, put the house of York to flight, and restored
the King to his former liberty.

The bodies of such of the Nobility, Burials of the dead slain in the battles
at S. Albans.
and others of eminent rank and quality which lost their lives in these
mortal contentions, were buried in the Abbey Church, (as I have partly touched
before) in Saint Peter's, and in other religious Structures, accordingly as they
were befriended; the common Soldiers were buried in Churchyards, and upon a
little green at the Towns end, called No man's land, which lies betwixt the
two ways (as I take it) leading to Luton, and Sandridge.

Nere unto the road high way (says Camden in this tract) between Stenenhaugh
and Knebworth (the seat of the worshipful house of the Littons, Burials of the
dead betwixt Stenenhaugh, and Knebworth.
descended from Litton in Darbishire) I saw certain round hills cast up by man's
hands, such as the old Romans were wont to rear for Souldi^ers slain in the
wars, of which the Captain himself laid the first turse: and now for Essex.

Essex is a country large in compass, Camd. in Essex.
(the circumference thereof being one hundred forty six miles) fruitful of
woods, plentiful of Saffron, and very wealthy.

A late writer having reckoned up the commodities which this County does
affoard, M. Drayton. Song 19.
concludes on this manner.

If you esteem not these, as things above the ground,
Look under, Roman burials, and the bones of Gyant-like found in Essex.
where the Vrnes of ancient times are found:
The Roman Emp^rours Coins, often digd out of the dust,
And warlike weapons, now consumed with cankring rust,
And huge and massy bones of mighty fearful men,
To tell the worlds full strength, what creatures lived then,
When in her height of youth, the lusty fruitful earth
Brought forth her big-lim'd brood, even Giants in their birth.
Near to Showbery, Burials near Showbery.
in Rochford Hundred, are certain hills, in which the bodies of the Danes there
discomfited, and slain in the reign of Edmund Ironside, lie buried in Essex.

What way (says Camden in Essex) this country looks toward Cambridgeshire,
Barklow shows itself, well known now, by reason of four little hills or
Burries cast up by man's hand: such as in old time were wont to be raised,
Burials near Barklow.
as Tombs for Soldiers slain, whose relics were not easy to be found. But
when a fifth and sixth of them were not long since dug down, Ancient Tombs.
three troughes of stone were found, and in them, broken bones of men, as I was
informed. The country people say, that they were reared after a field there
fought against the Danes, for, Dane wort, which with bloud-red berries, comes
up here plenteously, they still call by no other name, then Danes-bloud, of the
number of Danes that there were slain, verily believing that it bloometh from
their blood.

for Edmund, surnamed Ironside, King of England, having fought six battles
with the Danes, within the compass of one year, in which at the beginning he
had the better, putting them ever to rout, played here in this place his last
prize, where he was so defeyted (by the means of false Edrick his counsel)
that he lost the flower of the English Nobility. In memorial of which
Battle, king Canutus the Danish Conqueror built this Church at such time,
when as upon remorse and repentance for the blood which he had shed, he erected
Chapels in what part soever he had foughten any field, and shed Christian
blood. Of which my old Rimer Robert of Gloucester.

Certain small hillocks are remaining near to this Church at this day, out of
which have been dug the bones of men; Armor, and the water chains of
horse bridles; as the Inhabitants told me.

Claudius the Emperor (says S Danyel) had the honor of taking the whole Isle
of Britain to the Roman Empire, Battles and burialls of the dead, ^^ and
about ^he ancient Ba^hg of Maldon.
which though thus won, was not, till a long time after, overcome. For now
the Britains (understanding the misery of their dissociation: how their
submission brought but the more oppression) colleague themselves against the
Romans, taking their occasion upon the outrages, committed on the person and
state of Queen Vaodicia, or Boudicea, widow of Prasutagus king of the
Icenians, (the Inhabitants of Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge, and
Huntingtonshires) a great and rich Prince, who (at his death) had left Nero his
heir, and two daughters, hoping thereby to free his house from injuries. But
it fell out contrary; for, no sooner was he dead, but his kingdom was spoiled
by the Cen^urions, his house ransackt by slaves, his wife beaten, and his
daughters ravished. Besides the chief men of the Icenians (as if all the
region had been given in prey) were rest of their goods, and the kings kinsmen
esteemed as captives: with which contumely, and fear of greater mischief,
they conspire with the Trinobants (the Inhabitants of Midlesex and Essex) and
others (not yet inured to servitude) to resume their liberty. And first set
upon the Garrisons of the Veteran Soldiers (whom they most hated) defeited the
ninth Legion, whereof they slew all the foot, forced Cercalis the Legate, and
leader to flight, and put to the sword seventy thousand Romans and associates,
inhabiting this municipall Town Comolodunum, now Maldon, as also London and
Verulam; before Suetonius the Governor of the Province could assemble the rest
of the dispersed forces, to make head against their army, conducted by
Vaodicia, who, (with her two daughter* brought into the field to move
compassion and revenge) incites them to that noble and manly work of liberty.
Which to recover, she protests to hold her self there but as one of the vulgar
(without weighing her great honor and birth) resolved to win, or dye. Many
of their wives were likewise there to be spectatours and incouragers of their
husbands valor. But in the end Suetonius got the victory with the slaughter of
fourscore thousand Britains: of the Romans only four hundred were slain,
and not many more hurt, says Tacitus, lib. Annal. 14. ca. 11.

Vaodicia seeing the overthrow of her Army, was notwithstanding unvanquished in
her own Noble Spirit, and scorning to be a spectacle in their Triumphs, or a
vassal to their wills, after the example of Cleopatra, she made an end of her
miseries and life by poison: She was affoarded honorable burial, and so were
the rest of her vanquished Army there slain according to their quality,
near unto the places where the battle was stricken.

BISHOPS OF LONDON CANONIZED SAINTS.
(...) London.
MEllitus the first Bishop of this See, after the remouall of the
Archbishopricke to Canterbury, had a shrine erected to his honor in this
Church, as I have touched before. In his time, and partly by his instigation,
this Cathedral Church was built by Ethelbert King of Kent. He was consecrated
Bishop of London by Saint Austin, Archbishop of Canterbury, the year 604. In
the government whereof he continued nineteen years; in which time and about
the fourth year of his consecration, he went to Rome to confer with Boniface
the Pope about diverse things, and was by him honorably entertained. A year or
two after his return, died both Ethelbert King of Kent, as also Sebert of the
East Angles, whom he had converted to the Christian Faith.

G^dwin.
King Sebert left behind him three wicked sons, that being never baptized,
came notwithstanding one day into the Church at Communion time, and asked the
Bishop what he meant that he delivered not of that same fi^e bread unto them
as he was wont to their father Sebert, and did yet unto the rest of the people.
He answered, that if they would be washed in the water of life, as he was, and
the rest of the people there present; then would he deliver unto them of this
bread also: but otherwise, neither was it lawful for him to deliver, nor them
to receive it. This notwithstanding they would have enforced him, and when they
could not prevail, were so enraged, as they expelled him their dominions,
hardly holding their hands from doing him violence at that time. He, being
thus exiled, went first unto Laurence Archbishop of Canterbury, and finding him
in little better case then himself was at London, departed into France,
together with Iustus Bishop of Rochester. Being sent for soon after by
Laurence, it happened the same year that the same Laurence died, and he was
appointed to succeed him: where he sat about five years, even until the day
of his exspiration. Of which an old Anonimall Manuscript, thus.

To whom Melite than plainly began succeed,
That fyve year so ruled the Church in right.
And than this earth forsook for heuens mede
And went to blyss where God would of his might
The year of Crystes nativite by right
Six hundryd full twenty and four accountyd
When earth his corpse had hyd and surmowntyd.
Gregory the Great, Bishop of Rome, writ to Mellitus concerning the purifying
(but not the pulling down) of Idolatrous Churches within these kingdoms; An
Epistle well worthy the observation, which I have read in Gotcelinus the Monk,
who writes of the life and actions of Saint Austin, of other Bishops of the Sea
of Canterbury, as also of diverse Saints in those primitive times: and dedicates
his works to Anselme, Archbishop of Canterbury; Such was the letter of Gregory
as follows.

Dilectissimo silio Mellito Abbati, Mss in lib. Sim. (...) aurat.
Gregorius servus seruorum Dei.

Post discessionem Congregationis nostre que tecum est, valde sumus suspensi
redditi, quia nichil de prosperitate vestri itineris audisse nos contigit. Cum
ergo Deus omnipotens vos ad reuerendissimum fratrem nostrum Augustinum
Episcopum perduxerit, dicite ei quid diu mecum de causa Anglorum cogitans
tractaui, videlicet quia Fana Idolorum destrui in eadem gente minime debeant,
sed ipsa que in eis sunt Idola destruantur. Aqua benedicta in eisdem Fanis
aspergatur, Altaria construantur Reliquie componantur, quia si Fana eadem been
constructa sunt, necesse est vt a cultu Demonum in obsequium very Dei debeant
commutari, vt dum gens ipsa eadem Fana sua novidet destrui, de cord erroren^
deponat, and Dominum verum cognoscens et adorans, ad loca que consuevit
familiarius concurrat. Et quia Boues solent in sacrificio Demonum multos
occidere, debet eis eciam de re hac aliqua solemnitas iramutari, vt die
dedicationis vel natalicijs sanctorum Martyrum quorum illic reliquie ponuntur,
tabernacula sibi circa easdem Ecclesias que ex Fanis commutate sunt de ramis
arborum faciant, and religiosis conuiuijs solemnitatem celebrent Nec animalia
immolent, sed ad laudem Dei in vsum suum animalia occidant, et Donatori omnium
de sacietate sua gracias referent; vt dum eis aliqua externis gaudia res
exuantur, ad interiora gaudia consentire facilius valiant. Nam duris mentibus
simul omnia abscidere impossible esse non dubiam est, quia et is qui summum
locum ascendere nititur, gradibus vel passibus non autem saltibus eleuatur. Sic
Israheletico populo in Egypto Dominus siquidem innotuit, sed tamen eis
sacrificiorum vsum quem Diabolo solebat exibere in cultu proprio reseruauit, vt
eis in suo sacrificio animalia immolare preciperet, quatinus cor mutantes aliud
de sacrificio ammitterent, aliud retinerens Vt et si ipsa essent ^nimalia que
offerre consueuerant, vero tamen Deo hec et non ydolis immolantes iam
sacrificia ipsa non essent.

Hec igitur dilectionem tuam predicto Fratri necesse est dicere, vt ipse in

Hereby we may see the pious advise and great policy of this learned Father
of the Church, for the converting of the misbeleeuing Pagans, or heathen people
of this kingdom from Idolatry, to the true worship of the everliving God.

My forenamed Author Gotceline in the 53. Chapter of his first Book, tells me
that the names of the prime pillars of the English Church, and the especial
propagators of the Gospel, in these times, were engraven upon the Tarpeyan
Rock at Rome, of which number this my Mellitus is one of the principal. As
appears by these Latin Rimes following, sometime likewise engraven or cut in
the foresaid Rock under each several name to their further glory.

It is written of Mellitus, that when upon a certain time the City of
Canterbury was by negligence set on fire, and began to waste and consume away
by much increasing of the flames, so that no help of man, nor casting of water
thereon, was able to quench or stay the same, the greatest part of the city
being at length almost burnt, and the furious flashes extending themselves even
unto the Bishops place: this good Bishop seeing man's help now to fail, and
trusting only in the aid and succor of almighty God, commanded that he might
be carried out of his house, and set against these fierce flames of fire,
piercing and flying all round about.

Now where the greatest rage of this burning was; there was the place of
Martyrdom of the four holy crowned Saints. When then the Bishop by his
servants was brought forth, and set in this place, here he began with prayer
(sick as he was, for he was often troubled with infirmities of body, and much
grieved with the Gowte, Mellitu^ quenched by his prayer, the fire burning the
City of Canterbury.
notwithstanding ever whole and sound of mind) to drive away the peril of the
fire: which the stout strength of strong men with much labor could not before
bring to pass. And behold the wind that blew from the South, whereby this
fire was first kindled and blasted abroad (now suddenly bent against the South)
first tempered his blasts; for fear of hurting the places right over in the
other side, and after quite quenching the flames, ceasing and extinguishing the
fire, made all calm and well again. And truly this good man of God which did
fervently always burn with the fire of inward charity, and was wont with his
often prayers and holy exhortations to drive from himself, and all his, the
danger of ghostly temptations, and trouble by spirits of the air, might now
justly prevail against the wind, and easily cease these temporal flames, and
obtain that they should never hurt him nor his.

After the death of Mellitus, the Church of London was long without a Pastor,
even until that Segebert the son of Segebert (surnamed the little) obtaining
the Kingdom of the East Saxons, by the persuasion of Oswin, King of
Northumberland, became a Christian, and procured Ceada a virtuous and godly
Priest, to be consecrate Bishop of his country: which was done in the holy
Island, (...) 3. c. 2^
near to Barwicke, by Finan, Bishop of Durham, from whence he returned to this
his Diocese, and began with more authority to perfect the work he had
already begun, erecting in diverse places, Churches, making Priests and Deacons,
who in preaching and baptising* might assist him, (...) Tilbu^y, Cities.
especially in the Cities of Ithancester and Tileburg, the one standing upon
the Thames, the other upon a branch thereof, called Pant, in which two places
diverse newly assembling together christened, he instructed them after the rules
of religious persons, as far as their tender capacity could then conceive.

And hereby way of digression, let me speak somewhat of this small hamlet of
Tilbury, in ancient time the seat of the Bishops of London; and no question in
those days, when as Bishop Cedda by baptism ingra^ted the East Saxons in the
Church of Christ, a pretty fair city, howsoever it consists now only of a
few cottages, much honored by that famous, religious, Sir Horace V^^e Ba^on of
Tilbury.
and fortunate great Commander in the wars, Sir Horace Vere Knight, Lord Vere
of Tilbury. Of whom, and of his elder brother, Sir Francis Vere Knight,
deceased, and honorably buried, like (as he was) an expert and valiant
warrior; in the Abbey of Westminster; a late Poet has thus written.

Then lived those valiant Veres, both men of great command,
In our employments long: Sir Francis, and si^ Ho^ace Vere* M. (...). Song (...)
whose either Marshall hand
Reached at the highest wreath, it from the top to get,
Which on the proudest head, Fame yet had ever set
But to return: this man of God Cedda, having, at first and last, continued a
long time in these countries, preaching the word of life, by which he made a
great harvest unto Christ: went down into his own country of Northumberland,
(which he oftentimes used to visit) where he builded a Monastery at
Lestinghen, wherein he died, and was buried, of whom no more, until I come to
speak of that Foundation, save only these verses following:....... Now London
place does take
Which had those of whom time Saints worthily did make* S. Chad Bishop of
Lichfield.

As Cedda (Brother to that reverend Bishop Chad,
At Lichfield, in those times, his famous seat that had)
Is Sainted for that See amongst our reverend men,
From London though at length remoou'd to Lestingen
A Monastery, which then richly he had begun*


Erconwald, S. Erconwald.
the son of Offa King of the East Saxons, and the fourth Bishop of this
Diocese, was likewise (as I have already spoken) canonized; of whom venerable Bede thus writes.

Bed. lib. 4 ca. 6.
At that time (says he) when Sebba and Sigher ruled the East Saxons, the
Archbishop (which was Theodore) appointed over them, Erconwald to be their
Bishop in the City of London: the life and conversation of which man, both
before he was Bishop, and after, was reported and taken for most holy, as also
even yet the signs and tokens of heavenly virtues and miracles do well
declare. Cures by Saint Erconwald, Horse-licter.
For until this day, his Horse-licter being kept and reserved by his
Scholars, wherein he was wont to be carried when he was sick and weak, does
daily cure such as have agues, or are diseased any otherwise. And not only the
sick persons that are put under, or laid by the Horse-licter to be so healed;
but also the chippes and pieces that are cut off from it, and brought to sick
folks, are wont to bring them speedy remedy. This and many other the
miracles wrought by him (if we may believe Capgraue) was the cause of his
canonization: questionless he was a devout and virtuous man, and bestowed his
patrimony in the building of two Monasteries, one for Monks at Chertsey in
Surrey, another for Nuns at Barking in Essex, of which before. Thus much then
here for a conclusion as follows.

Him Erkenwald ensues The East English Offa's son,
His Fathers Kingly Court who for a Crosiar fled,
Whose works such fame him won for holiness that dead,
Time him enshrined in Paul's (the mother of that See)
Which with revenues large, and privileges he
Had wondrously endowed: to goodness so affected,
That he those Abbeyes great from his own power erected,
At Chertsey near to Thames, and Barking famous long.
S. Theodred.
Theodred, Bishop of the Diocese, may challenge a place in this my Calendar,
for that he was surnamed the Good, pro praerogatiua virtutum, for the
pre-eminence of his virtues, says Malmesbury, lib. 2. de Pontif. Anglor. he
flourished about the year, 900. he was buried under a high tomb by the window
of the vault going down into S. Faiths Church.

S. Egwulfe.
Of Egwulfe and his Shrine, I have already written all that I know.

S. Richard.
Richard Fitz-neale had his Shrine in S. Paul's Church, but upon what ground, or
for what reason he was thus much honored, I do not learn. He was the son
of Nigellus, or Neale, Bishop of Ely; and was made Treasurer of England by the
purchase of his father the foresaid Nigellus. Ex lib. Elien. in bib. Co^.
Richardus filius Nigelli Episcopi Eliens. pro quo Nigellus pater emit officium
Thesaurij a Rege auaro pro Quadragint. Marcis, pro quibus pecunijs Nigellus
pater spoliauit Ecclesiam Eliens. Thesauro suo et ornamentis. This purchase was
made when as the King, Henry the second, went to the wars of Tolous.

It is further written in the book of Ely, that this Richard Fitz-neale, after
the burial of Nigellus his father (being also an enemy to the Church of Ely as
his father had been before) made have to pass over the Seas to King Henry the
second, fearing that some evil would be prepared against him, if the Church
should have sent any thither before him: At whose coming to the King, he
accused the Monks of Ely of many things, and did therewith so edge the King
against them, that the King sending into England, charged by Wunnecus, one of
his Chaplains, that the Prior of Ely should be deposed, and the Monks with
all their goods to be proscribed and banished.

This man being Treasurer to King Henry the second, the treasure of the said
Henry the second at his death, came unto one hundred thousand marks;
notwithstanding the excessive charges of the King many ways.

This Richard (being Bishop of London, by the name of Richard the third, and
the Kings Treasurer) was chosen for the government of this See in the year of
our redemption, one thousand, one hundred, eighty and nine, being the first
year of King Richard the first, and was consecrated Bishop at Lambeth, by
Baldwine, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the year of Christ, one thousand, one
hundred, ninety: he died the fourth of the Ides of September, in the year of
grace, one thousand, one hundred, ninety and eight, being the ninth year of
King Richard the first, as I have it out of the Catalogue of Treasurers of
England, collected by Francis Thin.

He bestowed much upon the building of his Church, S. Paul's, as also upon other
Edifices belonging to his See, which was the cause, I conjecture, wherefore the
Shrine was erected to his memory.

Many miracles (says Mat. Paris) were wrought at the tomb of Roger, S. Roger.
surnamed the Black, the four and fortieth Bishop of this Diocese, who lies
buried near to the preaching place in Saint Paul's Church, under a monument of
gray marble, of which, as also of him, I have partly spoken before. Godwin,
Bishop of Hereford, out of the foresaid M. Paris says, that this Roger was a
reverend man, religious, learned, painful in preaching, eloquent, a great
Housekeeper, and of very gentle and courteous behavior: whereunto he might
have added (as it is in my Author) that he was also stout and courageous. For,
Rustandus the Popes Nuntio being earnest in a convocation for setting forward a
certain prolling devise to scrape up money for his master, he not only
withstood him openly, but cried out upon the unreasonable and shameless
covetousness of the Court of Rome, and was the only means of staying the
course of that exaction. For revenge hereof, not long after they began to frame
an accusation against him at Rome, alleging matters altogether false and
frivolous. It forced him to travel thither, and cost him great sums of money
before he could rid his hands of that brable.

The year 1233. Walter Mauclerke, Bishop of Carlisle, taking ship to pass over
the seas, was hindered by some of the Kings Officers, for that he had no
license to depart the Realm. These Officers for so doing, he excommunicated,
and riding straight unto the Court, certified the King what he had done, and
there renewed the same sentence again.

About the same time, the King gave commandment for the apprehending of Hubert
de Burgo Earl of Kent, who having sudden notice thereof at midnight, got him
up, and fled into a Church in Essex. They to whom the business was committed,
finding him upon his knees before the high Altar, with the Sacrament in one
hand, and a cross in the other, carried him away nevertheless unto the Tower
of London. The Bishop taking this to be a great violence and wrong offered to
holy Church, would never leave the King (which was Henry the third, a King
indeed very re^igious) until he had caused the Earl to be carried unto the
place from whence he was fetched; which was thought to be a means of saving
the Earls life. For though order was taken he should not escape thence, yet it
gave the Kings wrath a time to cool, and himself leisure to make proof of
his innocence. By reason whereof, he was afterward restored to the Kings favor
and former places of honor.

But the story here follows, which is also annexed to his tomb, that above
all others gives the truest testimony of his religious, vigerous, and undaunted
masculine spirit,

Mat. Paris, an. 1230.
Upon the day of the conversion of Saint Paul, while Roger, Bishop of London was
at high Mass within the Church of Saint Paul in London, a sudden darkness
ouershadowed the Quire, and therewith came such a tempest of thunder and
lightning, A strange Tempest.
that the people there assembled, thought verily the Church and Steeple had
come down upon their heads. There came moreover such a filthy savor and
stink withal, that partly for fear, and partly for that they might not abide
the savor, they voyded the Church, falling on heaps one upon another, as they
sought to get out of the same. The Vicars and Canons forsook their Deskes, so
that the Bishop remained there only with one Deacon that served him at Mass.
Afterward when the air began to clear up, the people returned into the Church,
and the Bishop, qui remansit intrepidus, who remained all the time nothing at
all abashed, went forward and finished the Mass.

M. D. Polyol. Song. 24.
Thus Roger has a room in this our Sainted throng,
Who by his words and works, so taught the way to heaven
As that great name to him, sure vainly was not given.
Now for a conclusion, if you desire greatly to know the greatness of this
christian name of Roger, as the Poet here in this place seems to call it,
consult with Verstegan in his Etymologies of the ancient Saxon proper names of
men and women, and he will tell you that Roger was at the first, Rugard or
Rougard, and afterward Rugar, and with us lastly Roger. Rou or Ru is our
ancient word for rest, repose, or quietness, guard, to keep, or conserve, so
as Rugard (now Roger) is a keeper or conseruer of rest and quietness.

Such a keeper, such a conseruer of peace and quietness, was this our Bishop
Roger, whom I leave to his eternal rest and repose, and so take my leave of
this sometime his Diocese.

Here ends the Diocese of London:
ANCIENT FUNERAL MONVMENTS WITHIN THE Diocese of NORWICH.
In Suffolk.
Dunwich.
THE first seat of the Bishops of this Diocese was at Dunwich in Suffolk,
Felix the first Bishop of Dunwich, or Dunmok. Harding. ca: 91.
and the first Bishop thereof was Felix, a Burgundian.

At Dunmok than was Felix first Bishop Of Estangle, and taught the Christen
^ayth, That is full hye in heaven I hope.

His happy coming into this kingdom, happened upon this occasion, as
follows.

Sebert, or Sigebert, king of the East Angles, a man in all points learned, and
most Christian, who whilst his brother was yet living, being himself banished
into France by his father Redwald, Beda lib. 2. ca. 15 Hist. Eccl.
was there baptized and instructed in the Faith; of which faith he labored to
make all his Realm partakers, as soon as he came unto the Crown. Whose good
endeavor herein, the foresaid Felix did most earnestly favor, and with great
praise apply himself. Who when he came from Burgundy (where he was borne, and
took holy orders) into Britain to Honorius the Archbishop, unto whom he
opened his desire and purpose, which was, to preach the word of God unto the
foresaid East Angles. The Archbishop gladly gave him license, and sent him
forth to sow the seed of eternal salvation, in the misbeleeuing hearts of the
people of that country. His zeal and virtuous desire proved not in vain:
For, this holy husbandman, and happy tiller of the spiritual field, found in
that Nation plentifulnesse of fruit, and increase of people that believed him.
For he brought all that Province (being now delivered by his help from their
long iniquity and unhappiness) unto the faith and works of Justice, and in
the end to the reward of perpetual bliss and happiness for ever, according
to the good abodement of his name, which in latin is called Felix, and in our
English tongue, sounds Happy. He was made Bishop about the year of our
redemption, 630. and chose Dunwich for his Episcopal Chair; being a City in
foregoing ages, spacious, much frequented, and well peopled with inhabitants.
Famous also for a Mint therein, some men of the town can yet show of the
coins, which are sterling pence, with this inscription, Ciuitatis Dunwic.

But now by a certain peculiar spite and envy of Nature, that suffers the
greedy sea to have what it will, and encroch still without all end, the
greatest part thereof is violently carried away with the waves, and it lies
(as it were) desolate.

The common fame and report of the Inhabitants is, that before the town came
to decay, Two and fifty religious st^^ctures, as many windmil^, and as many
top ships in Dunwich. Recorda Dun.
there belonged thereunto, two and fifty religious houses, as parish Churches,
Priories, Hospitals, and Chapels; as many Windmils, and as many top Ships.
But certain it is, as appears by manifest and sound Record which I have
seen (says Stow) that even of late time, there was within the said town,
six parish Churches, two houses of Friars, an house which had been of
Templars, two Hospitals, and three Chapels: four of these parish Churches are
now of late swallowed up in the Sea, and but two of them remaining on the land,
to wit, Saint Peter's, and All Saints. The Inhabitants of Dunwich desiring
succor for their Town, against the rage of the Sea, affirm that a great
piece of a Forest, sometime thereby, is devoured and turned to the use of the
Sea.

Camd. in Suss.
In the reign of William the Conqueror (says Camden) Dunwich had in it two
hundred and six and thirty Burgesses, an hundred poor people: it was valued
at fifty pounds, and threescore thousand Herings of gift, for so we read in
Domesday book.

In the reign of Henry the second, as William of Newborough writes, It was a
town of good note, and full stored with sundry kinds of riches.

At which time when England was all on a light fire with new stirs and
broiles, this town was so fortified, that it made Robert, Earl of Leicester
afraid, who with his army ouer-ranne all the parts thereabout at his pleasure.

But to draw nearer to these our times, I have read and copied out a large
Treatise of Dunwich, (now in the custody of Sir Simonds D'Ewes Knight) of which
so much in this place as I find to be any way pertinent to the premises, and
my purpose. This treatise or relation of Dunwich, was written in the reign of
Queen Mary, and sent to one Master Dey, from a friend of his, whose name is
there concealed.

The state of Dunwich since the foregoing time. Six parish Churches.
Sir, etc. Six parish Churches were anciently in Dunwich, the first was Saint
Leonards, now drowned in the sea; the second, Saint Peter's, now standing; the
third, Saint John's, likewise swallowed up of the Sea; the fourth, Saint
Martins, now lying under the waves; the fifth, Saint Nicholas, now altogether
shipwrackt; and the sixth, the Parish of All Saints, now standing and remaining.
Two houses of Friars.
Also there was two houses of Friars, very fair Churches and building, walled
round about with a stone wall, with diverse fair gates, as yet there may be
seen; the which gray Friars was of the order of Saint Francis, and called the
Friars Minors: and the black Friars were of the order of Saint Dominicke, (and
were called the Friars Preachers.

Also there was in the said Town, One house of Templa^s.
an ancient and very old Church, called the Temple of our Lady; the which
Church, by report, was in the Jews time, and was valted over. And the roof of
the same Church, and also the Isles, were leaded all over. And it was a Church
of great privilege and pardon in those days, and was endowed with diverse
Rents, Tenements, Houses, Lands, and other profits and commodities, both free
and coppie: as well in Donwiche, Westelton, Dyngle, etc. as also in diverse
other places, etc. And commonly there was kept a Court, called Donwiche Temple
Court, on the day of All Souls, for the leuying and gathering up of the
yearly revenue of the same.

Also there is in the said Town, Two Hospitals
two Hospitals, the one is called Saint James, which Church is a great one, and
a fair large one after the old fashion, and diverse tenements, houses, and
lands to the same belonging, to the use of the poor, sick, and impotent
people there. But now lately, greatly decayed and hindered by evil Masters of
the said Hospital, and other euilly disposed covetous persons, which did sell
away diverse lands and rents from the said Hospital, to the great hinderance of
the poor people of the said Hospital, as plainly it is to be proved.

The other Hospital was of the holy Trinity, The couetou^nesse of the Masters
and Officers. The destruction of both Hospitals.
and was, and is, called the Mason Dieu, whereof the Church is now pulled
down, and decayed by the means of such evil Masters and covetous persons, as
decayed the other Hospital. But there is yet diverse tenements, houses, lands,
and rents, remaining to the use of the poor of the same Hospital. The which
Mason Dien was an house of great privilege, and a place exempt, and there was
a very little proper house, and a proper lodging for the Masters of the same,
for the time being to dwell in. As there has been masters of the same Mason
Dieu, in times past that has been worshipful, viz. one there was of late
days, a Master of Art, and another that was a Squyre, and such like, etc. I
would to God these injuries and wrongs done to these two poor Hospitals might
be restored, and reformed again to their former estate. For, surely, whosoever
shall do it, shall do a good work before God; I pray God bring it to pass,
Amen.

Also there was in the said Town of Donwiche, Three Chappel^*
three Chapels, whereof one was of Saint Antony, another of Saint Francis, and
a third was of Saint Katherine. The which three Chapels were put down, when
all the houses of Religion were put down.

But you shall further understand, that the common fame of a great number of
credible persons is, and has been for a long time past, that there has been
in the Town of Donwiche before any decay came unto it, fifty and two parish
Churches, houses of Religion, Hospitals and Chapels, and other such like; as
many wind-mils, and as many top Ships.

Also I think you do remember the manner, form, and fashion of the building
and making of Saint John's Church, and Saint Nicholas Church, how they were
close sled both North and south, and the steeples in the midst like
Cathedral Churches now used, and as it seems, as the old manner of
Cathedral Churches then was. And most likest so was the Church of Saint Felix:
for certainly one of these three Churches, was the Bishops seat of Donwiche,
The Cathedral Church uncertain.
if one of them were not after another, as the Sea drowned them.

And further you shall certainly understand, that when Saint John's Church was
taken down, A strange and ancient burial of a Bishop.
there lay a very plain fair Grauestone in the Chancell; and when it was
raised and taken up, next under the same Grauestone was a great hollow stone,
hollowed after the fashion of a man, for a man to lie in: and therein a man
lying with a pair of Boots upon his legs, the forepart of the feet of them
peicked, after a strange fashion, and a pair of Challices of course metal
lying upon his breast, the which was thought to be one of the Bishops of
Donwiche, but when they touched and stirred the same dead body, it fell, and
went all to powder and dust.

And although these aforesaid three old Churches were not sumptuous, great, and
very fair, after the manner and fashion of Cathedral Churches now used, yet it
seems they might serve in those days very well; for it plainly appears in
the book of the description of England, and in the title of Bishoprics and
their Sees, the thirteenth chapter, whereas these words following are said.
Bishops Seats anciently what they were.
Take heed, for in the beginning of holy Church in England, Bishops ordained,
and had their Sees in low places and simple, that were conueniable and meet
for contemplation and devotion, etc. But in King William the Conquerours time
by doom of Law Canon, it was otherwise ordained, that Bishops should remove,
and come out of small towns, and to have their Sees in great Cities. By means
whereof, it seems that the town of Donwiche being then greatly decayed, and
also then likely more and more to decay (as it has done indeed) from a great
city (as some do say) or at the least from a very great ancient Town, to a
little small Town, the Bishops seat of Donwich, was removed from Donwich to
Elmham, and Thetford, and afterward to the City of Norwich, whereas it yet
remains.

A Mint in Dunwich.
There was a Mint in Dunwich; for, one Master Holliday told me that he had a
grote, whose superscription on the one side, was Ciuitas Donwic. Diverse other
things he told me of to make it a city. The Treatise is much longer, but
enough is already delivered.

The succession of the Bishops of Dunwich, is set down by Bishop Godwin, to
which I refer my Reader.

The foundation of the Black Friars in Dunwich.
This religious Structure was founded by Sir Roger de Holishe, Knight, of the
order you have heard before, of the time, dedication, value, or surrender, I
find not any thing. Persons of note buried in the Church of this Monastery,
were as follows:

Burials in the black Friars at Dunwich.
Sir Roger de Holishe, Knight, the foresaid founder* Sir Raufe Vfford, and Dame
Ione his wife. Sir Henry Laxiffeld Knight. Dame Ione de Har^ile. Dame Ada
Crauene. Dame Ione Weyland, Sister of the Earl of Suffolk. John Weyland, and
Ione his wife. Thomas, son of Richard Brews, Knight. Dame Alice, wife of Sir
Walter Hardishall. Sir Walkin Hardesfield. Austin Valeyus, Raph Wingfeld,
Knight. Richard Bokyll of Leston, and Alice, and Alice his wives. Sir Henry
Harnold Knight and Friar.

The gray Friars of Dunwich was founded first by Richard Fitz-Iohn and Alice
his wife, (...) in the black Friars of Dunwich.
and after by King Henry the third: of which I have no further knowledge.

Herein lay interred the bodies of Sir Robert Valence, the Heart of Dame Hawise
Ponyngs. Dame Ideu of Ylketishall. Sir Peter Mellis, and Dame Anne his wife.
Dame Dunne his mother. John Francans, and Margaret his wife. Dame Bert of
Furniuall.... Austin of Cales, and Ione his wife. John Falley^, and Beatrix his
wife, Augustine his son.... Wilex^es. Sir Hubert Dernford. Katherine, wife of
William Phellip, Margaret, wife of Richard Phellip. Peter Codum.

I had the notes of these buried in these Monasteries, as also of diverse other
Monasteries in Suffolk and Norfolk, out of the painful collections of
William le Neue Esquire, York Herald, truly copied out of the ancient
originals thereof, remaining in his custody.

Bury Saint Edmunds, or Saint Edmundsbury.
This Town seems (says Camden) to have been of famous memory, considering
that* when Christian Religion began to spring up in this tract, king Sigebert
here founded a Church, The foundation of the first Church in Bury.

The first foundation of the Abbey by the common people.


and it was called Villam Regiam, that is, a royal town. But after that the
people had translated hither the body of Edmund, that most christian King, whom
the Danes with exquisite torments had put to death, and built in honor of him,
a very great Church, wrought with a wonderful frame of timber: it began to be
called Edmundi Burgus, commonly Saint Edmundsbury, and more shortly, Bury. But
especially since that King Canutus, for to expiate the sacrilegious impiety of
his Father Suenus against this Church, being often affrighted with a vision of
the seeming-ghost of Saint Edmund, The second by K Can^^e.
built it again of a new work, enriched it, offered his own Crown unto the
holy Martyr, brought unto it, Monks with their Abbot, and gave unto it many
fair and large Manors, and among other things, the Town it self full and
whole: over which, the Monks themselves by their Seneschall had rule and
jurisdiction. Thus Knuts Charter began.

In nomine Poliarchie Jesus Christi saluatoris. Ex Arch Turr. Lend.
Ego Knut Rex totius Albionis Insule aliarumque nationum plurimarum, in
Cathedra regali promotus, cum concilio and decreto Archiepiscoporum,
Episcoporum, Abbatum, Comitum, aliorumque omnium fidelium meorum,
elegisanciendum and perpeti stabilimento ab omnibus confirmandum, vt
Monasterium quod Bederics Court, Farm, or mansion house.
Budrices Yurthe nuncupatur sit per omne euum Monachorum gregibus deputatum ad
inhabitandum, etc.

After a long recital of his many donations, corroborations, privileges, and
confirmations of former grants, he ends with an Additament, of fish and fishing.

Huic libertati concedo additamentum, scilicet maritimos pisces qui mihi
contingere debent annualiter per Thelonei lucrum, et Piscationem quam Vlskitel
habuit in Pilla. et omnia iura, etc.

These gifts, to this Abbey, as to the most of all others, were finally
concluded with a fearful curse to the infringers thereof, and a blessing to
all such that did any way better her ample endowments: the Charter is signed
with the mark, which is the cross, and the consent of thirty and five
witnesses, of which a few, as follows.

Ego Knut Rex, etc. hoc priuilegium iussi componere, and compositum cum signo
Dominice crucis confirmando impressi. Ego Aelgifa Regina omni alacritate mentis
hoc confirmaui. Ego Wuls^anus Archiepiscopus consensi. Ego Adelnodus confirma^i
etc.
Camd. in Suss.
After Knut, one Haruey, the Sacrist coming of the Norman blood, compassed the
Burgh round about with a wall, whereof there remain still some few relics,
and Abbot Newport walled the Abbey. The Bishop of Rome endowed it with very
great immunities, and among other things granted, That the said place should be
subject to no Bishop in any matter, and in matters lawful to depend upon the
pleasure and direction of the Archbishop, which is yet observed at this day.

And now by this time the Monks abounding in wealth, erected a new Church, of
a sumptuous and stately building, enlarging it every day more then other with
new works, and whiles they laid the Foundation of a new Chapel, in the
reign of Edward the first, There were found (as Euersden a Monk of this place
writes) the walls of a certain old Church, Euersden.
built round, so, as that the Altar stood (as it were) in the mids, and we
verily think, says he, it was that which was first built to Saint service.

But what manner of town this was, and how great the Abbey was while it stood,
Leland.
hear Leland speak, who saw it standing. The Sun, says he, has not seen
either a City more finely seated, (so delicately stands it upon the easy
ascent, or hanging of an hill, and a little river runs down on the East
side thereof) or a goodlier Abbey; whether a man indifferently consider, either
the endowment with revenues, or the largeness, or the incomparable
magnificence thereof. A man that saw the Abbey would say verily it were a
City: so many gates there are in it, and some of brass, so many Towers, and a
most stately Church: upon which, attend Now but two.
three others also standing gloriously in one and the same Church yard; all of
passing fine and curious workmanship.

If you demand how great the wealth of this Abbey was, a man could hardly tell,
and namely how many gifts and oblations were hung upon the tomb alone of Saint
Edmund: and besides, there came in, out of lands and reuenue^, a thousand, five
hundred and threescore pounds of old rent by the year.

The Abbot and Covent of the Monastery, governed the Townsmen and all within
Banna Leuca, within the bounds of a mile from the town, by their Steward, who
ever gave the oath to the new elect Alderman: which was delivered in these
words following: copied out of a Lieger book sometimes belonging to the said
Abbey.

The oath of the Alderman of Bury.
Ye schall swear that ye schall bear you trewly and fethfully in the Office of
the Aldermanscipe of this Town of Bury; ayens the Abbot and the Covent of this
place, and all her mynistris: ye scall bear, keep and maintain Pees to yowre
powere, and ye schall nor thing appropre, nor accroche that longyth to the said
Abbot and Covent* nor take upon the thyngis that long on to the Office of the
Baylishchipp of the said Town. Alsoo that ye schall not procure be you, nor be
noon other, priuyly, nor openly any thing unlawful, that might be harm or

customs that of dew long on to them, inasmoche as ye mey leyfully do. Thees
artycles and poyntis ye schall observe and keep the tym that ye stand in this
office. So help you God, and all his Seynts, and be this Book.

Notwithstanding this oath, The broile between the Townsmen, the Abbot, and
Covent of Bury.
the Townsmen, now and then, fell so foul upon the Abbot and Covent, that
they imprisoned the Abbot, struck the Monks with the Bailiffes and Officers
belonging to the Abbey, assaulted the Abbey gates, set fire on them, and burned
them with diverse houses near adjoining, that belonged to the Monastery. They
burnt a Manor of the Abbots, called Holdernesse Barn; with two other Manors,
called the Almoners barn, and Haberdone, also the Granges that stood without
the South-gate, and the Manor of Westlie, in which places they burnt in corn
and grain, to the value of a thousand pounds. They entered into the Abbey
court, and burnt all the houses on the north side; as Stables, Brewhouses,
Garners, and other such necessary houses: They burned the Mote hall, and
Bradford hall, with the new hall, and diverse Chambers and Sollers to the same
halls annexed, with the Chapel of Saint Laurence, at the end of the Hospital
hall; also the Manor of Eldhall, the Manor of Horninger, with all the corn
and grain within and about the same.

Assembling themselves together in warlike order and array, they assaulted the
said Abbey, brake down the gates, windows, and doors, entered the house by
force, and assailing certain Monks and servants that belonged to the Abbot,
did beat, wound, and evil entreat them; brake open a number of chests,
coffers, and forssets, took out Chalices of gold and silver, books,
vestments, and other ornaments of the Church, beside a great quantity of rich
plate, and other furniture of household apparel, armor, and other things,
beside five hundred pounds in ready coin, and also three thousand Florens of
gold. All these things they took and carried away, together with diverse
Charters, Writings, and Miniments; as three Charters of King Knute, four
Charters of King Hardicanute, one Charter of King Edward the Confessor, two
Charters of King Henry the first, and other two Charters of King Henry the
third; which Charters concerned as well the Foundation of the same Abbey, as
the grants and confirmations of the possessions and liberties thereunto
belonging.

Many more are the outrages committed at several times by the Townsmen,
against these cloistered brethren; which are recorded in the foresaid Lieger
book of S. Edmunds bury: all which to relate, would seem incredible, and make
this my digression, I confess, too much ouerlong and troublesome, thus then to
return.

The Dedication, the Foundation, the time, and the Founders, and the value of
this Religious structure may be partly gathered by the premises; it was
replenished with Monks Benedictines, or as some say, Cluniacks: it was
surrendered into the Kings hands the fourth of November, in the one and thirtith
year of Henry the eight.

Relics in the Abbey Church, out of a book called Compend. Com. pertorum, in
the treasury of the Exchequer.
Amongst other Relics, the Monks of this Church had Saint Edmunds shirt;
certain drops of Saint Stephens blood which sprung from him at such time as he
was stoned, and some of the coals with which Saint Laurence was broiled.

They had certain parings of the flesh of diverse holy Virgins, and a sinew of
Saint Edmund laid up in boxes.

They had some Skuls of ancient Saints and Martyrs, amongst which was one of
Saint Petronill, or Pernell, which the country people were taught to lay to
their heads, thereby to be cured of all kind of agues. They had the boots of
Saint Thomas of Canterbury, and the sword of Saint Edmund.

Aniles Fabulae.
It was in use here amongst the Monks, as often as they desired rain, to carry
with them, in their Processions, a coffin wherein the bones of Saint Botolph
were enclosed, hoping thereby the sooner to have pleasant shoures to refresh
the dry parched earth.

They had certain wax candles, which ever and only they used to light in
wheat-seeding; these they likewise carried about their wheat grounds, believing
verily that hereby neither Darnell, Tares, nor any other noisome weeds would
grow that year amongst the good corn.

These Relics they had, and many more, which wrought many strange effects, by
their own relation. The Abbots of this house were Barons of the Parliament.

But now to come to the burials of certain worthy personages in this Abbey
Church of Bury, and first.

S. Edmund, King and Martyr.
Here lay sometimes enshrined, the sacred Remains of Edmund, King of the East
Angles, and Martyr; who was the son of one Alkmund, a Prince of great power
in these parts. In the reign of this King Edmund, Hungar, and Hubba, two
Danish Captains, with an innumerable multitude of Heathen Danes, entered the
Land at the mouth of Humber, and from thence invaded Nottingham, York and
Northumberland, where (without respect of age or sex) they laid all wast,
Speed Hist ca. 11
and left the Land, whence they departed, like to a desolate wilderness. From
thence they came with the like fury into Edmunds territories, and sacked
Thetford, a frequent city in those days: but he not able to withstand their
violence, fled into ^his Castle at Framingham, wherein he was of them besieged,
and lastly taken in a village, then called now Hoxon.
Heglisdune, of a wood bearing the same name, or rather yielded himself to
their torments, to save more christian blood; for it is recorded, that because
of his most constant Faith and profession, those Pagans first beat him with
bats, then scourged him with whips, he still calling upon the name of Jesus:
for rage whereof, they bound to a stake, and with their arrows shot him to
death; and cutting off his head, contemptuously threw it into a bush, after he
had reigned over the East Angles the space of sixteen years.

Camden, out of Abbo Floriacensis, says, that the bloody Danes having bound
this most christian King to a tree, for that he would not renounce
christianity, shot him with sharp arrows all his body over, augmenting the
pains of his torment, with continual piercing him with arrow after arrow, and
thus inflicted wound upon wound, so long as one arrow could stand by another,
as a Poet of middle time versified of him: I am loca vulneribus desunt, nec dum
furiofis
Tela, sed hyberna grandine plura volant.
Though now no place was left for wound, yet arrows did not fail,
These surious wretches, still they fly thicker then winter hail.


His body and head, after the Danes were departed, were buried at the same
royal Town, as Abbo terms it, where Sigebert the East Anglean King, and one
of his predecessors at his establishing of Christianity, built a Church, and
where afterward (in honor of him) was built another most spacious, and of a
wonderful frame of Timber, and the name of the Town upon that occasion of his
burial, called unto this day, Saint Edmundsbury: This Church and place, (to
speak more fully to that which I have written before) Suenus the Pagan Danish
King, in impiety and fury, burned to ashes. But when his son Canute, or
Knute, had made conquest of this Land, and gotten possession of the English
Crown, terrified and afrighted (as says the Legend) with a vision of the
seeming Saint Edmund, in a religious devotion to expiate his Fathers
sacrilege, built it anew most sumptuously, enriched this place with Charters
and Gifts, and offered his own Crown upon the Martyrs Tomb; of whom for a
conclusion, take these verses following.

Vtque cruore suo Gallos Dionisius ornat Ex lib. Abb. de Russ. in bib. Col.

Grecos Demetrius; gloria quisque sui^:
Sic nos Edmundus nulli virtute secundus;
Lux patet and patrie gloria magna sue.
Sceptra manum, Diadema capud, sua purpura corpus,
Ornat ei sed plus vincula, mucro, cruor.
The 20. day of November, S. Robert Martyr, ex lib. Abb. de chateris in bib Cot.
in our Calender, was kept holy in remembrance of this King and Martyr. Puer
Robertus apud Sanctum Edmundum a Iudeis fuit Martirazatus, 4. Id. Iunij An.
1179. et illic sepultus.

Alanus Comes Britannie obijt An. 1093. and his iacet ad hostium australe
Sancti Edmundi: Alan, Earl of Britain and Kichmond. Milles Catal. Rich.
ex eod, lib. de chateris.

This Allan here buried (or as some will have it in the monastery of Rhedon)
surnamed the Red, or Fergaunt, was the son of Eudo, Earl of Britain, and
entered England with William the Conqueror (his Father in Law.) To whom the
said Conqueror gave the honor and County of Edwyn, within the County and
Province of York, by his Charter in these words: I William, (surnamed Bastard,
King of England) give and grant to thee my Nephew Allan, Earl of Britain, and
to thy heirs for ever, all those Villages, Towns, and Lands which were late
in possession of Earl Edwin in Yorkshire, with knights fees, Churches, and
other liberties and customs, as freely and honorably as the said Edwyn held
them. Given at the siege before York. Alban being a man of an high spirit, and
desirous to govern the Province entirely which he had received, The building
of Richmond Castle.
built a strong Castle by Gillingham (a village which he possessed) by which he
might defend himself, not only against the English, who were spoiled of their
goods and lands, but also against the fury and invasions of the Danes. When the
work was finished, he gave it the name of Richmond, of purpose, either for the
greatness and magnificence of the place, or for some Castle in little Britain
of the same name.

Tho. Plantaginet Earl of Norfolk.
Here sometimes, under a goodly Monument in the Quire of this Abbey Church, lay
interred the body of Thomas, surnamed of Brotherton, the place of his birth,
the fifth son of Edward the first, after the Conquest, king of England, by
Margaret his second wife, the eldest daughter of Philip king of France,
surnamed the Hardy.

Vincent. Catal. Norf.
He was created Earl of Norfolk, and made Earl Marshall of England, by his
half brother King Edward the second, which Earledomes Roger Bigod (the last of
that surname Earl of Norfolk, and Earl Marshall) leaving no issue, left to
the disposition of the king his Father. This Earl died in the year of our
redemption 1338.

Here lay buried the body of Thomas Beauford (son of John of Gaunt, begotten
of the Lady Katherine Swyneford his third wife) who by King Henry the fourth
was made Admiral, Tho. Beauford Duke of Exceter.
then Captain of Calis, and afterward Lord Chancellor of England. He was
created by the said King Earl of Perch in Normandy, and Earl of Dorlet in
England. And lastly in the fourth year of King Henry the fifth, he was created
Duke of Exceter, and made knight of the order of the Garter. He had the leading
of the Rereward at the battle of Agincourt, and the government of king Henry
the sixth, appointed to that office by the foresaid Henry the fifth on his
deathbed. He valiantly defended Harflew in Normandy (whereof he was governor)
against the Frenchmen, and in a pitched field encountering the Earl of Armiguar
put him to flight. He died at his House of East Greenwich in Kent, upon
Newyeares day the fifth of Henry the sixth: for whom all England mourned, says
Milles:

Mary Queen of France.
The body of Mary Queen of France, widow of Lewis the twelfth: daugh^er of King
Henry the 7. and sister to king Henry the eight, was here in this Abbey Church
entombed. After the death of Lewis (with whom she lived not long) she married
that Martial and pompous Gentleman, Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk. She died
on Midsomer Eeue, 1533.

John Boon Abbot of Bury.
John Boon, Abbot of this Monastery, had his tomb and interrement here in
this Church; who died in the beginning of February, in the ninth year of the
reign of king Edward the fourth, as appears by the said kings Conged'eslire
or permission royal to the Prior and Covent of this House to make choice of
another Abbot, as follows.

Out of a Lieger book of the Abbey.

Now hear a word or two of the word Conged'eslire out of the Interpreter.
Cowell lit. C.


Conged'eslire, Conged'eslire.
id est, venia eligendi, leave to choose: is a mere French word, and signifies
in our Common Law, the Kings permission royal to a Deane and Chapter in time
of vacation to choose a Bishop; or to an Abbey or Priorie to choose their Abbot
or Prior. Fitz. not. br. fol. 169. B. 170. B C, etc. Touching this matter M.
Gwin in the Preface to his Readings says, That the king of England, as
Sovereign Patron of all Archbishoprickes, Bishoprics, and other
Ecclesiastical Benefices, had of ancient time free appointment of all
Ecclesiastical Dignities, whenever they chanced to be void, inuesting them
per Baculum et Annulum, id est, with a Staff and a Ring, and afterward by his
Letters Patents: And that in process of time he made the election over to
others, under certain forms and conditions: as namely, that they should at
every vacation, before they choose, demand of the king Gonged'eslire, that is,
license and leave to proceed to election; and then after the election, to crave
his royal assent, etc. And further, he affirms by good proof out of Common
Law books, that king John was the first that granted this, and that it was
afterward confirmed by Westminster. pri. cap. which Statute was made Anno 3. Ed.
primi. And again by the Statute Articuli Clerica. 2. which was ordained Anno
25. Ed. 3. Statuto tertio.

Sir William Elmham, Sir William Spencer, Sir William Fresill, qui obijt Anno
1357. William Lee Esquire, and his wife, daughter of Harlestone; lay here
interred.

The famous Poet, and the most learned Monk of this monastery, was here
interred. I mean John Lidgate, so called of a small village not far off
where he was borne. John Lidgate Monk.
A village (says Camden) though small, yet in this respect, not to be passed
over in silence, because it brought into the world, John Lidgate the Monk,
whose wit may seem to have been framed and shapen by the very muses
themselves: so brightly reshine in his English verses, all the pleasant graces
and elegancie of speech, according to that age, having traveled through France
and Italy, to learn the languages and Arts. Erat autem non solum elegans
Poeta, et Rhetor disertus, verum etiam Mathematicus expertus, Philosophus
acutus, et Theologus non contemnendus: For he was not only an elegant Poet,
and an eloquent Rhetorician, but also an expert Mathematician, an acute
Philosopher, and no mean Divine, says Pitseus; you may know further of him in
his Prologue to the story of Thebes; a Tale, as his fiction is) which (or some
other) he was constrained to tell, at the command of mine Host of the Tabard
in Southwarke, whom he found in Canterbury, with the rest of the Pilgrims which
went to visit Saint Thomas Shrine.

This story was first written in Latin by Geffrey Chaucer, and translated by
Lidgate into English verse: but of the Prologue, of his own making, so much as
concerns himself, thus.

....... while that the pilgrims ley
At Canterbury, well lodged one and all
I know not.
I not in sooth what I may it call,
Hap or Fortune, in conclusioun,
That me befell to enter into the town.
The holy Saint plainly to visit,
After my sickness, vows to acquit.
In a cope of black, and not of green,
On a Palfrey slender, long, and lene,
With rusty bridle, made not for the sale,
My man to forne with a void male,
That by Fortune took mine Inn anon
Where the Pilgrims were lodged euerichone.
The same time her governor the host
Stonding in Hall, full of wind and bost,
Liche to a man wonder stern and fers,
Which spoke to me, and said anon dan Pers,

Ye be welcome newly into Kent:
Though your bridle have another boos ne bell;
Beseeching you that ye will tell
First of your name, and what cuntre
Without more shortly that ye be,
That look so pale, all deuoid of blood,
Upon your head a wonder thredbare hood,
Well arrayed for to ride late:

Dan John (quoth he) well brouke ye your name,

Ye have been sick I dare mine head assure,
Or let feed in a faint pasture:
Lift up your head, be glad, take no sorrow,
And ye should home ride with us to morrow

But toward night, eat some Fennel read,

And like as I have power and might,

Though it be so the Moon shine clear,
I will my self be your Clock:

To morrow early when I see my time,
For we will forth parcel before prime.
Accompany Verily.

Thus, when the Host had cheared up Lidgate with these fair promises and
wholesome admonitions for his health, he lays his commands upon him in these
terms following.

What, look up Monk, for by Cocks blood
Thou shall be merry, who so that say nay,
For to morrow anon as it is day,
And that it ginne in the East to daw,
Thou shall be bound to a new law,
At going out of Canterbury town,
And lien aside thy professioun,
Thou shall not chese, nor thy self withdraw,
If any mirth be found in thy maw,
Like the custom of this company,
For none so proud that dare me deny,
Knight Nor Squire.
nor Knave, Chanon, Priest, ne Nonne
To tell a tale plainly as they conne,
When I assign, and see time oportune;
And for that we our purpose will contune,
We will homeward the same custom use,
And thou shall not plainly thee excuse:
Be now well ware, study well to night,
But for all that, be thou of heart light,
Thy wit shall be the sharper and the bet.
But I run too far with these rimes, it is time to return.

Scripsit partim Anglice partim Latin, partim prosa partim versu libros numero
plures, eruditione politissimos. He writ partly English, partly Latin, partly
in prose, and partly in verse; many exquisite learned books says Pitseus,
which are mentioned by him and Bale, as also in the latter end of Chaucers
works the last edition. He flourished in the reign of Henry the sixth, and
departed this world, (aged about threescore years) circiter An. 1440. upon
whose tomb this Epitaph following is said to have been engraven.

Mortuus seclo, superis superstes,
Hic iacet Lidgat tumulatus vrna:
Qui fuit quondam celebru Britanne
Fama Poesis.
These and infinite many other worthy personages here, in this Abbey Church
entombed, were by King Henry the eight, utterly overthrown; what time, as at
one clap he suppressed all monasteries, persuaded thereto by such as under a
goodly pretense of reforming Religion, preferred their private respects, and
their own enriching, before the honor of Prince and Country, yea, and before
the glory of God himself.

Saint Mary's Church in the Abbey yard.
This Parish Church is wondrous ancient, built in the very infancy of
christian Religion, in the days of Felix the first Bishop of the East Angles,
as I have it out of a Lieger book sometimes belonging to the Abbey, in these
words.

The antiquity of S. Mary's.
Arbitror quod parochia ville a tempore antiquo in memoria Sancte Marie
Virginis fuerit constructa: videlicet, ab initio prime Christianitatis istius
prouincie, et a tempore primi predicatoris felicis memory, and sanctissimi
Episcopi Felicis Orientalium Saxonum.

The funeral monuments in this Church are almost all defaced, especially such
as are of any antiquity. Upon one Tomb there remains only these few words,
for the memory of Roger Drury, Esquire, and Agnes his wife, he died 1472. and
she, 1445.

Drury and Agnes his wife.

At Ikesworth, at Haulsteed, near to Rougham, and else where the family of
Drury, (which signifies in old English, a Precious Jewel) has been of great
respect and good note, especially since they married with the heirs of
Fressill, and Saxam, faith Camden in this tract.

Sir William Drury.
This name is much honored by Sir William Drury Knight, Lord President of
Munster, and Lord chief Justice of all Ireland, as you may read in the
continuation of the Irish Cronicle, penned by John Vowell, alias Hooker, where
his valiant good services at Muttrell, Bulloigne, and Callais in France: at the
commotion in Devonshire, at Barwicke being Provost Marshall, and at the
besieging and taking of Edenborrough Castle, where he was general of the
Army, are set down at large: this man lies buried at Dublin in Ireland.

Sir Robert Drury Knight, Sir Robert, and Sir William Drury.

monument.

Carew Castle in Penbrokeshire gave both name and original to the notable
family de Carew, Io. Carew, and Marg. his wife. Videsis Camd. in Penbrokeshire
says Camden, who avouch themselves to have been called aforetime de
Montgomery, and have been persuaded that they are descended from that Arnolph
de Montgomery, who won Penbrokeshire; who, by some, is reckoned amongst the
Earls of that County.

Of this ancient surname (rightly honored by the King in creating George
Carew, Earl of Totnes, Lord Baron of Clopton) I shall have occasion to speak
in diverse other places.

This religious Foundation, The definition of a Chantrie and of a Guild.
as it is in the Charter, was called a Chantrie, and a Guild. Cantaria est
Aedes sacra: ideo instituta et dotata praedijs, vt Missa ibidem Cantaretur pro
anima fundatoris, et propinquorum eius, says Sir Hen. Spelman, Glossar. lit.
C. A Chantrie is a sacred Edifice, therefore instituted and endowed with
possessions, that Mass might there be song for the soul of the Founder, and
his kindred.

Gilda est societas quorundam, Id. Hen. Spelman lit. G.
pura charitatis, religionis, vel mercaturae gratia confaederatorum. A Gild is
a society of certain persons confederated or living together, for the only
pure cause of charity, Religion, or for the trade of Merchandise.

It is a College, a sodalitie, or fellowship; a brotherhood, or company
incorporate: or it is an adunation, or a commonaltie of men gathered into one
combination, supporting their common charge by a mutual consent.

In the year and on the day of the month of a great part of this Town of
Bury was burnt down to the ground. Upon the rebuilding whereof on the
Frontispice of one of the Houses this distich following is in golden letters.

Vt Prior illa domus violento corruit igne,

Kediton, or Kedington.
In the South window of this Church is to be seen a Barnardiston kneeling in
his complete armor, his coat armor on his breast, and behind him seven
sons. In the next pane of the glass is Elisabeth the daughter of Newport,
kneeling with her coat armor likewise on her breast, and seven daughters
behind her* and under it is thus written, now much defaced.

Orate pro animabus Thome Barnardiston militis, et Elisabethe vxoris eius, qui

Over against the said South window, under the second Arch of the said South
side of the Church, is the Monument of the said Sir Thomas Barnardiston in
stone at length, in his complete armor, and the said Dame Elisabeth his wife
by him. And in a table of stone, under their coat-armours, this Epitaph or
Inscription.

This is the Monument of Sir Thomas Barnardiston knight, Sir Tho. Barnardiston
and Elis. his wife.

On the North side of the said Church is a very fair Monument or tomb, with
the pourtraiture of another Sir Thomas Barnardiston, and his Lady Elisabeth,
who died not long since.

Barnardiston.
In the second window of the North side of this Church is to be seen a
Barnardiston kneeling in his complete armor, and his coat armor on his
breast, and upon both his shoulders, the writing under him is wholly-perished:
over him is written.... Non Peccata nostra.... nobis...... This seems to be
very ancient.

Ixworth, or Ikesworth.
The foundation of Ikesworth Priory.
Here sometimes stood an ancient Priory founded by Gilbert Blund, a man of great
Nobility, and Lord of Ikesworth, whose issue male, by the right line, ended in
William, that in king Henry the third his days, was slain in the battle at
Lewis, and left two sisters his heirs, Agnes wife to William de Creketot, Came.
in Suff.
and Roise wedded to Robert de Valonijs, says Camden. This Priory was valued
to be yearly worth two hundred and fourscore pounds, nine shillings five
pence.

Clare.
Here stood a religious House of Augustine Friars, whose Foundation may be
gathered out of certain rythmicall lines, which not many years since, I
copied out of an ancient Roll, as then in the custody of my dear deceased
Friend, Aug. Vincent, Windsore Herald; the Rubricke, or the Title in red
letters, of this Roll, is as follows.

This Dialoge betwix a seculer askyng, and a Friar answering, at the grave of
Dame Johan of Acres; shows the lineall descent of the Lordis of the honor
of Clare, fro the time of the fundation of the Freeris in the same honor, the
year of our Lord a M.ccxlviii. unto the first of May, the year, a M.cccclx.

The Pictures of the Secular Priest and the Friere are curiously limmed upon
the Parchment. The verses are both in Latin and English, and being in both
good, I think it good to emprint them in both languages.

Joan of Acres Countess of Gloucester and Herdord.
The body of Joan of Acres was here entombed, as you have already read: She was
the second daughter of king Edward the first, and Queen Eleanor, borne in the
first year of her fathers reign, at a City in the Holy Land, sometime named
Ptolomais, commonly called Acon, Aker, or Acres, where her mother remained
during the wars that her father had with the Saracens. She was married at
eighteen years of age, and outliuing her first husband (nominated in the
Roll) she degenerated so far in the election of another, as that she made
choice of one Raph de Monte-hermer sometimes her husbands and her servant. She
died here at her Manor of Clare the tenth of May, in the year 1305.

Edward Mont-hermer.
Here likewise in the Austine Friars by his mother was interred the body of
Edward Mont-hermer, eldest son of the foresaid Raph Mount-hermer (who having
obtained the kings favor, had the title of Earl of Gloucester and Hertford)
and Joan of Acres. He died without issue, the time uncertain.

Lionell Duke of Clarence, and Elis. his wife.
Lionell, or Leonell Duke of Clarence, and Earl of Vlster in Ireland, was
buried in the Chancell of this Priorie Church, together with his first wife
Elisabeth, daughter and heir of William de Burgh, Earl of Vlster aforesaid,
as appears in the parchment Roll. She departed this world in the year 1363.
And he about five years afterward, as I shall hereafter show.

This Lionell, surnamed of Antwerpe, the place of his birth, was the third
son of king Edward the third; Harding c. 187.
In all the world was then no Prince him like
Of hie stature, and of all semelinesse
The character of Leonell Duke of Clarence.
Above all men within his hole kyngrike
By the shulders, he might be seen doutlesse;
As a maid in halle of gentilnesse,
And in all places son to Retorike,
And in the feld a Lion marmorike.


Not long after the death of his wife Elisabeth, he was remarried unto
Violenta the sister of John Galeas, Duke of Milain, with whom he was to
receive a wondrous great Dowry; and in that regard he made a journey to
Millain, attended with a chosen company of the English Nobility, where in
most royal manner he espoused the said Lady. Of which his journey, and
marriage, may it please you read these following measures. The king his soonne
sir Leonell create
Hard. ca 186.187.
Duke of Clarence, and to Melayn him sent
With chivalry of fame well ordinate,
And squyers fresh, galaunt and sufficient
With officers and yomen as appent.
This Duke royal of Clarence excellent,
At Melayne wedded was then in royal wise
With that lady fair and beneuolent
Full royally, as to such a Prince should suffice,
And all the rule he had by council wise,
Fro mount Godard, unto the city of Florence
And well beloved was for his sapience.
In citees all he held well vnitees,
Great Iustes ay, and joyous tournements
Of Lords and knights, Leonell in election to be king of Italy.
he made great assemblees
Through all the land, by his wise regimentes.
They purposed hole by their common assentes
To croune him king of all great Italy,
Within half a year, for his good gouernaly.
But Stow, Stow Annal.
out of Paulus Iouius, writes more fully of this marriage.

In the month of April, says he, Leonell Duke of Clarence, with a chosen
company of the English Nobility went toward Millaine, there to marry with
Violentis the daughter of Galeasius the second of that name, Duke of Millaine,
at whose coming to Millaine, such abundance of treasure was in most bounteous
manner spent, in making most sumptuous feasts, setting forth stately sights,
and honoring with rare gifts above two hundred Englishmen, which accompanied
his son in law, as it seemed to surpass the greatness of most wealthy
Princes; for in the banquet whereat Francis Petrarch was present, A most
sumptuous feast. Costly gifts given.
amongst the chiefest guests, there were above thirty courses of service at
the table, and betwixt every course, as many presents of wondrous price
intermixed, all which, John Galeasius, chief of the choice youth, bringing to
the table, did offer to Leonell.

There were in one only course seventy goodly horses, adorned with silk and
silver furniture: and in the other silver vessels, Falcons, hounds, armor for
horses, costly coats of mayle, breast plates glistering of massy steel,
helmets and corselets decked with costly crestes, apparel distinct with costly
Jewels, soldiers girdles: and lastly, certain gemmes, by curious Art set in
gold, and of purple, and cloth of gold for men's apparel in great abundance.
Fragments of a feast s^fficient to serve ten thousand men
And such was the sumptuousness of that banquet, that the meats which were
brought from the table, would sufficiently have served ten thousand men But not
long after, Leonell living with his new wife, whilst after the manner of his
own country, as forgetting or not regarding his change of air, he addicted
himself overmuch to untimely banquetings, spent and consumed with a lingering
sickness, died, at Alba Pompeia, called also Languvill, in the Marquisat of
Mont-ferrat in Piemont, on the Vigill of Saint Luke the Evangelist, 1368. in
the two and fortieth year of his fathers reign. First he was buried, says
Camden in the Annalls of Ireland, in the City of Papie, hard by Saint
Augustine the Doctor: and afterward enterred at Clare in the Covent Church of
Austin Friars in England. He had issue only by his first wife one daughter,
named Philip. Of which you may read before in the printed copy of the
parchment Roll: and in the Chronicle of John Harding, as follows. His wife
was dedde, Cap. 186.
and at Clare was buried,
And none heir he had, but his daughter fair,
Philip that hight, as Cronicles specified,
Whom queen Philip cristened for his heir:
Tharchbishop of York for his compeire;
Her godmother also of Warwyk the countess
A Lady was of all great worthynes.
And in another place.

Cap. 187.
Children had he noone, but Philip heir
By Elizabeth his first wife, which the king
Edward married to Edmond Mortymer,
Therle of March, that was his ward full yyng,
Who gate on her Roger their derelynge.
Catal. of Honor.
Philip, the only daughter of Leonel Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, says
Milles (agreeing with the former, yet going a little further) was married unto
Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March; upon whom the said Edmund begot Roger; and
Roger, Anne: who being married unto Richard Earl of Cambridge, thereby
transported the right of the kingdom unto the House of York.

I find in my notes of Burialls in Monasteries, that these persons following
were also interred in this Priory Church.

Richard, Earl of Clare, whom some will have to be Founder: Dame Alice
Spencer: Sir John Beauchamp knight: John Newborn Esquire: who, amongst others,
brought the body of the foresaid Leonell, Duke of Clarence, into England* John
Wiborough: William Golderich* William Capell: and Eleanor his wife. The Lady
Margaret Scroope, daughter of.... Westmerland. John Kempe Esquire. Robert
Butterwyke Esquire. Ione Candishe, daughter of Clopton, Dame Eleanor Wynkepery.

Stoke Clare.
The foundation of Stoke College.
Here at Stoke, adjoining to Clare, was a College founded by one of the
Mortimers, Earl of March, valued in the kings books to be yearly worth
three hundred twenty four pounds, four shillings, penny, half penny. Sir
Edmund Mortimer Earl of March.
In this College was entombed the body of Sir Edmund Mortimer the last Earl
of March and Vlster of that house, Lord of Wigmore, Trim, Clare, and Conaught;
the Grandchilde of that Edmund Earl of March, who married the daughter and
only heir of Leonell, Duke of Clarence, as it is in the Roll.

Camd. in Radnorshire.
This Edmund, says Camden, in regard of his royal blood, and right to the
Crown, stood greatly suspected to Henry the fourth, who had usurped the
kingdom; and by him was first exposed unto dangers, in so much as he was taken
(in a battle fought at Pelale in Wales) by Owen Glendowr a Rebel, and
afterward whereas the Percies purposed to advance his right, he was conveyed
into Ireland, kept almost twenty years prisoner in the Castle of Trim,
suffering all miseries incident to Princes of the blood while they lie open to
every suspicion; and there through extreme grief ended his days, the
nineteenth day of January, 1424. in the third year of the reign of Henry the
sixth.

Of the foresaid battle, his taking and miserable imprisonment, thus much out
of Harding, as follows.

Sir Edmonde then Mortimer warred sore Hard. cap. 201.

Upon Owen, and did him mekyll tene,
But at last, Owen lay him before,
Where in batell they faught, as well was seen,
Where Owen took him prisoner, as then full kene,
With mekell folk on either side slain.
And set Edmonde in prysone and great pain.
He wrote unto the king for great socoure,
For he had made with Owen his fynaunce,
To whom the king would grant then no favor
Ne naught he would then make him cheuesaunce
For to comfort his foes disobeysaunce,
Wherefore he lay in fetters and sore prisone
For none payment of his great raunsone.
Here also lay buried the bodies of Sir Thomas Gray knight, and his first wife.
Luce the wife of Walter Clopton: Sir Thomas Clopton, and Ade his wife.

Sudbury. Saint Gregory's.
In this Church I saw a marble stone, Simon Archbishop of Canterbury.
some four yards long, and two broad, sometimes inlayd all over with brass;
under which, the Inhabitants say, that Simon Theobold, alias Sudbury, lies
interred; which may be true, for howsoever he has his Tomb in the Cathedral
Church at Canterbury, of which he was Archbishop (as I have written before) yet
that may be, perhaps, only his Cenotaph or honorarie funeral Monument.

This Simon built, whilst he was Bishop of London, the Chapel or upper end
of the Church, where this spacious Grauestone lies couched. As appears by this
Inscription in the glass window.

Orate pro Domino Symone Thepold, The foundation of All Souls Chapel.
alias Sudbury, qui istam Capellam fundauit, Anno Domini M.cccclxv. in
commemoracione omnium animarum dedicat, dat, consecrat.

In the place where his Fathers house stood, The foundation of Sudbury College.
he founded a goodly College, which he furnished with secular Clarks, and
other Ministers, which at the time of the suppression thereof, was valued at
one hundred twenty two pounds eighteen shillings, lands by the year. Thus
writes Godwin in the life of this Archbishop. And I find in the Catalogue of
Religious Houses, collected by Speed, that this Simon, together with one John
Chartsey, founded also the Priory of Augustine Friars in this Town; The
foundation of the Friars.
howsoever I have a Manuscript tells me, that one Baldwin de Shipling, or
Simperling, and Chabill his wife, were the sole Founders who lie buried in the
Chancell of the Priory Church. Besides in the said Church lie buried (as I have
it in the notes of burials, from William le Neue, York Heraldy the bodies of
Robert, the son of Sir William Simperling knight. Sir Robert Carbonell, and
Sir John his son, Knights; Sir William Gray, Knight. Sir Peter Giffard,

This sacred structure was dedicated to the honor of our alone Savior, and
Saint Bartholomew; valued at 222 l. 18 s. 3 d. and surrendered the 9. of
December, Anno Regni Regis Hen. octaui 36.

The education of Archbishop Simon.
But to return back again to the supposed Founder of this Monastery, Simon,
Archbishop as aforesaid; who from his childhood was ever brought up at the
School, and being yet very young, was sent by his father beyond the Seas to
study the Canon Law, His preferments.
and having proceeded Doctor of that faculty, became household Chaplain to Pope
Innocent the sixth, and one of the Judges or Auditors of his Rota. The said Pope
by way of provision, thrust him into the Chancellorship of Salisbury, and then
afterward, into the Bishopric of London. Ex Arch. Turris Land.

touched before) six years, His death.
one month, and ten days; he was most unworthily slain, or rather wickedly
murdered, by a company of villainous Rebels, whose death or martyrdom is
comparatively set down, with that of Saint Thomas Becket, by John Gower in his
book called Vox Clamantis, lib. 1. cap. 14. thus.

Cesus et atteritur pastor ab ore gregis.
O maledicta manus capud abscisum ferientis
Culpa sit horribilis, pena perbennis erit.
O qui tale Deo crimen prohibente patrasti
Perfide qua pena que nece dignus eris
O furor insane, gens rustica, plebs violenta
Quam tua fraus sceleris est super omne scelus.
And so he goes on, exclaiming against the savage barbarousnesse of the Rebels,
and this their execrable horrid act.

Sir Robert Hales, Sir Robert Hales.
Lord Prior of Saint John's Jerusalem, near Clerkenwell, and a great many of
others, that day tasted of the same cup and the Archbishop had done. The chief
leaders of this damned crew, were Wat Tyler of Maidstone in Kent, whom Walls.
calls the Idol of Clownes; John Wraw, a Priest, Jack Straw, John Littistar a
Dier in Norwich, who took upon him at Norwalsham in Norfolk, the name of the
King of the Commons, Robert Westborne, who did the like in Suffolk, etc. and
these had a Chaplain as graceless as themselves, one John Ball, an
excommunicated Priest, who with his wicked doctrine nourished in them their
seditious furies.

This rebellious insurrection is exactly, and to the life expressed, by my
forenamed Author Io. Gower, in the foresaid book, the eleventh chapter, where
in a vision he faignes to have seen and heard certain spirits of their Pseudo
Prophet Ball (personating hereby these and all other Rebels) calling one upon
another to rise up in commotion, as follows.

The ready pronenesse of the common people to rebellion.
Watte vocat, cui Thome venit, neque Symme retardat,
Betteque Gibbe simul Hykke venire iubent.
Colle furit, quem Gibbe iuuat nocumenta parantes,
Cum quibus ad dampnum Will coire vouet.
The cruelty and pride of the baser sort of people.
Grigge rapit, dum Dawe strepit, comes est quibus Hobbe
Lorkin et in medio non minor esse putat.
Hudde ferit quos Iudde terit, dum Tebbe iuuatur
Iakke domos que viros vellit, and ense necat,
Hog suam pompam vibrat, dum se putat omni
Maiorem Rege nobilitate fore.
Balle Propheta docet quem spiritus ante malignus
Edocuitque sua tunc fuit alta schola.
Talia, que plures furias per nomina noui,
Que fuerant alia pauca recordor ego.
Sepius exclamant monstrorum vocibus altis
Atque modis varijs dant variare tonos.
The horrible strange tones and vociferations of Balls roaring boys, these
Rebels.
Quidam sternutant Asynorum more ferino;
Mugitus quidam personuere boum.
Quidam porcorum grunnitus horridiores
Emittunt que, suo murmr terra tremit.
Frendet Aper spumans magnos facit atque tumultus,
Et queritat verres auget et ipse sonos.
Latratus que ferus vrbis compresserat auras
Dum Canum discors vox suribunda volat.
Vulpis egens vlulat lupus et versutus in altum
Conclamat, que suos conuocat ipse pares.
Nec minus in sonitu concussit garrulus Anser
Aurc^, que subito fossa dolor pauent.
Rombuant vaspe, sonus est horrendus eorum,
Nullus et examen dinumerare potest.
Conclamant pariter her suti more leonis,
Omne que fit peius quod fuit ante malum.
Ecce rudis clangor, sonus altus, fedaque rixa,
Vox ita terribilis non fuit vlla prius.
Murmr saxa sonant, sonitumque reuerberat aer,
Responsumque soni vendicat Echo sibi.
Inde fragore grauis strepitus loca propria terret,
Quo timet euentum quisquis adire malum.
Terruerat magnas nimio pre turbine gentes
Fear and distraction caused by commotion.
Graculus a cuius nomine terra tremit.
Rumor it, et proceres sermonibus occupat omnes
Consilium sapiens nec sapientis erat.
Casus inauditus stupefactas ponderat aures
Et venit ad sensus dures ab aure pauor*
Attemptant medicare sed immedicabile dampnum
Absque manu medici cura que cessit ibi.
But I have bin too long detained by these Rebels, whose infernal attempts had
condign punishment by so little of so much, which here is written, we may
clearly behold the hideous face of Anarchie, or government without Prince or
ruler, as also the distorted visage of Plebeian fury.

Of your cherity prey for the soul of Sir William Waldegraue, Sir Will.
Waldgraue Knight, buried at Callis.
Knight of Buers Saint Mary in Com. Suff. who died 12. December... and left
behynd, one son and four daughters, on whose souls Jesus have mercy. The said Sir
William Waldegraue died at Callys in France, where his body is buried in Saint
Mary's Church there.

Here lie buried, (as I have it by relation) Sir Thomas Eden Knight, and Thomas
Eden, Clerk of the star Chamber, both under one monument.

I read, Stow Annal. Hollins.
that Alexander Eden, Esquire, Sheriff of Kent, took Jack Cade, Captain of
the Rebels, in the 29. of Henry the Sixth, prisoner, for which, and for other
his good services against the said Rebels, he was made Custos or keeper of the
Castle at Rochester.

Of this surname is that learned Doctor of the Laws, Thomas Eden, Tho. Eden
Doctor of the Laws.
one of the masters of the Chancerie, and master of Trinity Hall in Cambridge;
of whose Family I shall have occasion to speak in another place. And so I
will take my leave of this Town, with the words of Camden in this Country.

Stour, the river, passes on, and comes to Sudbury (says he) that is to
say, the South Burgh, and runs in manner round about it, which men suppose
to have been in old time, the chief town of this Shire, and to have taken
this name in regard of Norwich, that is, the Northern Town. Neither would it
take it well at this day to be counted much inferior to the Towns adjoining:
for, it is populous and wealthy, by reason of clothing there, and has for the
chief Magistrate, a Mayor, who every year is chosen out of seven Aldermen.

Long Melford.
Upon the outside of this Church, these words following are engraven.

Pray for the souls of John Clopton, and Richard Boteler, of whose gooddys this
Chapel was built.

In the said Chapel, many of the ancient family of the Cloptons lie entombed.

Will. Clopton and Marg. his wife. Mar. and Tho. Clopton.
Hic.... Dominus Willelmus Clopton.... qui obijt.... ante festum Sancti Thome
1416. and Margeria vxor Willelmi.... que obijt..... 1424.

Of this worthy family I have spoken somewhat before, and shall have occasion
to speak more hereafter.

Sir Will. Cordal knight.
Here lies under a goodly Tomb the body of Sir William Cordall knight, Master
of the Rolls; A good man, as Camden calls him, who built an Almes-house in this
Town. You may know more of him by this his Epitaph.

Hic Gulielmus habet requiem, Cordellus, avito
Stemmate vir clarus, clarior ingenio.
Hic studijs primos consumpsit fortiter annos,
Mox and causarum strenuus actor erat.
Tanta illi doctrina inerat, facundia, tanta,
Vt Parlamenti publica lingua foret.
Postea factus Eques Reginae arcana Mariae
Consilia, and patriae grande subibat opus.
Factus est and custos Rotulorum; vrgente senecta
In Christo moriens, cepit ad astra viam.
Pauperibus largus, victum, vestemque ministrans
Insuper Hospitij condidit ille domum.
Butley.
The foundation of the Priory at Butley.
Here sometime stood a Priory of black Canons Augustines, founded by Raph de
Glanvile, dedicated to the blessed Virgin Mary. Valued in the Kings books at
three hundred eighteen pounds seventeen shillings two pence half penny
farthing, and surrendered the first of March, in the nine and twentieth year of
the reign of king Henry the eight.

Mic. de la Pole E. of Suffolk.
In this Priory Church was interred the body of Michael de la Pole, the third of
that name, Lord Wingfield, and Earl of Suffolk. Who was slain at the battle
of Agincourt, with Edward Plantagenet, Duke of York.

On our side, was the duke of York there slain,
Therle also of Suffolk worshipfully.
This battle was stricken on the 25. day of October, Ann. 1415.

Hadley.
Gurmond king of Denmark.
Here in this Church, as the Inhabitants say, Gurmond, or Gurthrun, a Danish
King lies interred: and this their assertion is confirmed by the most of our
ancient Historians; yet the Tomb which they show for his funeral Monument
bears not that face of Antiquity, as to be of seven hundred years and more
continuance; if any Monument remain here to his memory, in my understanding,
it is one of these in the North or South wall. This Pagan king of Denmark,
after he had for many years infested and harried this kingdom, and driven
Alfred our king to strange extremities; was in the end overcome by Alfred in
battle: presently upon which he was washed in the lauer of Baptism; Gurmound
christened.
(which was one of the conditions of peace at his overthrow) Alfred received
him for his godsonne by the name of Athelstane, and gave him in free gift this
country of East Angels; and in the same fountain of Grace (says Simon of
Durham) thirty of the chief Danish Nobility were initiated, upon whom the
true Christian King bestowed many rich gifts. Of all which my old ryming
Cronicler.

Gutron the king of Denmark that was tho, Hard ca. 109.

In Westsex werred full sore and brent the land,
With which the king so marryd was with woe,
He wist not well whether to ride or stond,
But to Ethelingay anon he took on hond
To ride, where then he hyd him in a place,
For dread of Danes, such was his hap and grace.
Where then his Lords and knights in good array,
Came to him then with hooste and great power,
Where than the king upon Gutron that day,
In battle strong with courage fresh and clear
Fought sore, and took Gutron prisonere,
And thyrtye dukes with him in compaye
Vnchrysten were, they all of panymrye.
And had the field with all the vyctorye
And of Danes many thousand slew.
He baptized than as made is memory
This king Gutron, that after was full true
And named was Athylstan all anewe
To whom the king gave than all Estenglond
As Edmond had to hold of him that land.
And all his dukes were also there baptized
And christen men bycame for goddys love
The year of Christ viii C. then compeysed
Seuente and viii as Flores does approve.
This Battle, and the baptising of Gutron and his Lords, I have also out of an
ancient namelesse Manuscript in my own custody, thus delivered.

Than Gunter that fader was of Haueloke
King of Denmark, was than of mykle might
Arevyd so than in Ingylond with his floke
Of Danes fell, cruyll, mighty and wight
With whom the king full strongly than dydd fight
And hem venquyste with sore fight and battle;
And ovar hond had so thrughe his gouernayll.
The which Gunter, and thyrty of his Lords
Thrughe grace took than baptyme at their desire.
Hadley the Kings ^ear. S^ow. Camd.
After he had governed these counties of Suffolk and Norfolk (keeping his
residence here in this Town) the space of twelve years complete, he died and
was buried in the kings town, called Headlega (so Hadley is called in the
Saxons language) in Suffolk among the East English, in the year 889.

Ipswich in times past Gipswich.
Had Ipswich (the only eye of this Shire) been as fortunate in her surname,
as she is blessed with commerce and buildings, she might well have borne the
title of a City; neither ranked in the lowest row: whose trade, circuit, and
seat, does equal most places of the land besides. It is adorned with twelve
or fourteen Churches; in all which, I find not any funeral Monument of
Antiquity, save one which came to light not long since upon the remouall of a
Pewe in Saint Laurence Church (and so like wise in other Churches many
Monuments are buried) under which the Founder of the said Church was interred,
as appears by this Epitaph engraven upon the Stone.

Io. Bottold.
Subiacet hic lapide John Bottold vir probus ipse
Istius Ecclesie primus Inceptor fuit iste.
Cuius anime Domine misereris tu bone Criste.
Obijt M.ccccxxxi. litera dominicalis G.
Since then that so few funeral Monuments are remaining at this day in the
Parish Churches of this Corporation, I will take a view of the sites of the
Religious Houses in and about this Town now ouerturned. Of which, and such
persons as I find to have been therein inhumed, as follows.

The Priory of Saint Trinity.
This Priory was founded by Norman, the son of Enott, and John de Oxenford,
Bishop of Norwich, tempore Hen. 2. replenished with black Canons Augustines:
and valued to be yearly worth fourscore and eight pounds six shillings nine
pence. Burials.
Herein lay buried Norman the Founder, and Langeline his wife, and Dame Ioane
Filian.

The Friars Preachers.
This Monastery was founded by Henry de Manesby, Henry Redred, and Henry de
Londham, The foundation of the Fri^^^ Preachers. Bu^ialls.

find to have been herein buried, were Dame Maud Boerell: Edmond Saxham
Esquire: John Fostolph, and Agnes his wife, Gilbert Rouldge, Ione Charles.
Edmond Charleton Esquire.

The white Friars Carmelites.
This Religious Edifice was founded by Sir Thomas de Londham, The foundation of
the Friars Carmelites.
says one, howsoever I find in the Catalogue of Religious Foundations
aforesaid in Speed, that the Lord Bardesley, Sir Geffrey Hadley, and Sir Robert
Norton knights, were the Founders about the year 1279.

Herein (for of the dedication, Burialls.
value, or surrender, I find nothing) were buried, Sir Thomas, and Sir Thomas
de Londham knights, John Londham Esquire, Margaret Colevile, Gilbert Denham
Esquire, and Margaret his wife, daughter of Edward Hastings. And in a
Manuscript penned by John Bale, I find these Carmelites following to have
been here sometimes inhumed. Johannes Hawle ob. 1433. Maij 15. Richardus
Hadley, ob. 1461. Aprilis primo. Johannes Wylbe, ob. 1335. 2. December. Johannes
Barmyngham vir doctissimus. Oxonia diu studuit and Parisijs intex Sorbonicos;
he was a man very learned; he studied a long time in Oxford, and at Paris
amongst the Sorbons. He writ diverse books mentioned by Pitseus; and died a
wondrous old man (being as then Prior of this Fraternity) the two and
twentieth day of January, Anno reparationis humana 1448. Johannes Balsham
Episcopus Archiliens. hic sepultus ob. 1530.

The Gray Friars.
Founded by the Lord Tiptoth. Foundation of the Gray Friars. Burialls.
In which lay buried (for I find no further of it then the Foundation) Sir
Robert Tiptoth knight, and Dame Vna his wife. The heart of Sir Robert V^ere the

The Black Friars.
Of this House I only find that one John Hares gave ground to build it
larger. These personages following I find to have been registered in the
Martirologe of this house. Persons Registered.
The Lord Roger Bigot, Earl Marshall. Sir John Sutton Knight. Lady Margaret
Plays. Sir Richard Plays. Sir Robert Vfford Earl of Suffolk.

Wolsey College.
Cardinal Wolsey borne in this town, whose vast mind always reached at
things, began here to build a most magnificent and sumptuous College, in the
place where sometime stood a small monastery of black Canons, founded by
Thomas de Lacy, and Alice his wife, and dedicated to the honor of Saint Peter
and Saint Paul.

Woodbridge.
John Albred, and Agnes his wife.
Hic iacet Johannes Albred quondam Tweleweuer istius ville.... ob. primo die
Maij.... 1400. et Agnes vxor cius..:

This Tweleweuer, with Agnes his wife, were at the charges (people of all
degrees being as then forward to beautify the house of God) to cut, gild, and
paint, a Rood Loft or a partition betwixt the body of the Church and the Quire:
whereupon the pictures of the Cross, and Crucifixe, the Virgin Mary, of
Angels, Archangels, Saints, and Martyrs, are figured to the life: which how
glorious it was when it was all standing, may be discerned by that which
remains. This their work of piety was depensild upon the fabric; of which
so much as is left:

Orate..... Iohannis Albrede et Agnetis......... soluerunt pro pictura totius

Rendlesham, Austin Philip. Ione saint Philbert, daughter of the Earl of
Suffolk. Isabell de Braham, and Edward the son of sir Thomas of Braderton.

Vfford.
This is the most neatly polisht little Church (that I have looked into) within
this Diocese. The roof whereof, and other parts of the Quire, being curiously
engraven with sundry kinds of works and pictures, all burnisht and gilt with
gold. The Organ case, whereupon these words, Soli Deo Honor and Gloria, are
carved, and gilt over; is garnished and adorned in most costly manner. The
Font, and the Cover of the same, is without compare, being of a great height,
cut and gloriously depicted with many Imageries consonant to the representation
of the holy Sacrament of Baptism, as also with the Arms of the Vffords,
Earls of Suffolk, whose principal habitation was in this Town.

It is said by the Inhabitants, the foresaid Earls of Suffolk, lie here
interred, but I find no show of it in the Church; as also the bowels of Raph
de Vfford, Raph de Vfford Lord chief justice o^ Ireland.
Lord chief Justice of Ireland: of whom the Annals of Ireland speak thus as
follows. Upon the 13. day of July, 1343, the Lord Ralph Vfford, with his
wife, the Countess of Vlster, came Lord chief Justice of Ireland: upon whose
entering, the fair weather changed suddenly into a distemperature of the air,
(...). Annal Hi^era.
and from that time there ensued great store of rain, with much abundance of
tempestuous storms, until his dying day. None of this Predecessors in the
times past was, (with grief be it spoken) comparable unto him. A wicked chief
Justice.
For, this Iusticer bearing the Office of Iusticeship, became an oppressor of
the people of Ireland, a robber of the goods both of the Clergy and Laity, of
rich and poor alike: a defrauder of many under the color of doing good: not
observing the rights of the Church, nor keeping the law of the Kingdom:
offering wrongs to the natural inhabitants: ministering justice to few or none,
and altogether distrusting (some few only excepted) the inborne dwellers in
the land. These things did he still, and attempted the like, misled by the
counsel and persuasion of his wife.

Thus he continued his rigorous government for the space almost of three
years: and upon Palm sunday, 1346. which fell out to be the ninth day of
April, went the way of all flesh. For whose departure, his own dependants,
together with his wife, sorrowed not a little: for whose death also the loyal
subjects of Ireland rejoice no less: the Clergy and people both of the Land,
Joy upon the death of the Justice.
for joy of his departure out of this life, with merry hearts do leap, and
celebrate a solemn feast at Easter. At whose death, the floods ceased, and the
distemperature of the air had an end, and in one word, the common sort truly
and heartily praise the only son of God. Well, when this Justice, (now dead)
was once fast folded within a sheet and Coffin of lead, the foresaid Countess
(with his treasure not worthy to be bestowed among such holy relics) in
horrible grief of heart, conveyed him over into England, there to be enterred.

Orate pro... Roberti Lamb, and Alicie Lamb......
Rob. Lamb and Alice his wife.
..... Lamb......
... Lamb.
These Lambs have been special benefactors to this Church, being sometimes
men of fair possessions in this parish, as I was told; their names with the
pictures of Lambs are depensild in many places of the woodworke and feeling of
the Church.

Simon Brook and his wives.
Hic iacent Simon Brook et Emota, Margareta et Alicia vxores eius, qui quidem
Simon obijt 12. october. 1488.

An ancient Family these Brooks, were in this parish, now extinct, as I have
it by relation.

Christopher Willoughby and his wife.
Orate pro bono statu Christopheri Willoughby Armigeri and Margerie vxoris
eius: this is in a glass window of the Church.

Campsey or Camesey.
The Nunnery of Campsey.
This was a Nunnery not far from Vfford, founded by one Theobald, and
consecrated to the honor of the Virgin Mary, which was valued at the
suppression, to be yearly worth in Lands, one hundred eighty and two pounds,
nine shillings five pence. These Nuns were of the order of S. Clare, and
called Minoresses.

Maud, The foundation of a Chantrie in the Priory Church at Campsey.
who was first married to William Lord Burgh, Earl of Vlster, and after, to
Raph de Vfford, chief Justice of Ireland, repenting her self (belike) of her
own and her last husbands delinquences committed in Ireland, of which I have
spoken before, obtained license of King Edward the third, by the procuration of
her brother Henry, Earl of Lancaster, to found a Chantrie in this monastery,
of five Chaplains, secular Priests, to pray and sing Mass for the souls of
the said William de Burgh, and Raph de Vfford, whose body was here interred:
such is the Charter of the Foundation.

Letheringham.
In the parish Church, and in the Church of the little Priory adjoining, are
diverse Tombs and grauestones to the memory of that noble and ancient Family of
the Wingfields, all of which are foully defaced. This Priory was founded by sir
John Boynet, The Priory of Letheringham
of the dedication order or time, I am altogether ignorant, it was valued at
twenty six pounds, eighteen shillings, five pence, of yearly commings in.
The Wingfelds here buried, were these.

Sir Robert Wingfeld, Lord of Letheringham. Sir Robert Wingfeld and Elizabeth
Gousall his wife, Sir John Wingfeld, and Elisabeth his wife. Sir Thomas
Wingfeld. Sir Robert Wingfeld, and Elisabeth Russell his wife, obijt Robertus,
1409. Thomas Wingfeld and Margaret his wife: Richard Wingfeld, Anne, and Mary.

Here is also an ancient fair Tomb very foully defaced, whereupon this
fragment of an Inscription following is only remaining.

.....Elizabethe Arundel Ducisse Norfol. and Iohannis Paulet militis, qui quidem
Johannes obijt x Maij M. cccclxxxi...... ac Domina Elizabetha Wingfeld vxor

Sir Antony Wingfield knight of the Ga^^or.
Sir Antony Wingfield of Letheringham Knight, son and heir of Sir John, lived
in the reigns of King Henry the eight, and Edward the sixth, in the 31. of
Hen. the 8. he was Captain of the Guard. He was Controller of Edward the sixth
his House, and of the privy Council to King Henry the eight, and Edward the
sixth: and Knight of the Garter. He died..... he married Elisabeth, daughter
and coheire of Sir George Veere Knight, and of Margaret his wife, the daughter
of Sir William Stafford. He was Vice-chamberlaine to King Henry the eight:
and, together with the Earls of Arundell and Essex, and others, appointed to
be ayding and assisting with his advise and counsel, the Executours of the
said Kings last Will and Testament: A copy whereof I have in my custody. By
which his will he gives to the said Sir Antony two hundred pounds.

In the Priorie Church here at Letheringham, diverse of the ancient family of
the Nantons lie buried. Naunton.
Of whom out of their pedigree, I have these notes following.

Master William Smart affirms that he has seen ^n ancient Evidence, dated
before the Conquest of England, wherein the Nantons are named, who says they
were written by the name of Nawnton.

Roger Awston reports that Nawnton came in with the Conqueror, and that he
has seen Records of the same, who for service done had then given him in
marriage a great inheritrix.

It is reported that Nawntons lands were at that time 700. marks, per annum.

These Nauntons are Patrons of the Church of Alderton in this County, as
appears by this Epitaph there.

Here lies Henry Naunton Esquire, late Patron of this Church, and Tristram
Naunton, H^n. Naunton, Tristram, Elisabeth.
both sons of William Naunton Esquire, and of Elisabeth his wife; and
Elisabeth wife to the said Henry, daughter of Euerard Asheby Esquire, and
Elisabeth daughter to the said Henry Naunton, and Elisabeth Asheby.

This is likewise in the Prioty Church here at Letheringham.

This Church of Buers is very neatly kept*

Out of the pedigree of the Waldegraues, this story following was collected by
John Raven, Richmond Herald.

On a time a Gentleman of Northampton being at the sign of the Grown in
Sudbury, The Antiquity of the Waldg^aues.
and having conference with master Edward Waldgraue of Bilston, in Com. Suss.
Esquire, did make unto him a very credible report of one Waldegraue in
Northamptonshire, affirming that he heard it reported of old time, that these
Waldgraues were of a very ancient antiquity before William the Conquerours
reign, and that his name should be John: who having one only daughter, and
meeting with one Waldgraue which came out of Germany, and was employed in the
Conquerors services, the said Germane Waldgraue related with Waldgraue of
Northamptonshire, concerning the marriage of his said daughter; and told him
that if he would give his consent that he might have his daughter in marriage,
that then he would procure him a pardon from the Conqueror, for the quiet
enjoying of his lands and livings. By which means he obtained the Conquerours
grant, with his own hand and Seal, for confirmation of all his lands unto him
and his posterity. The which Pardon and grant remains to be seen at this
day, 1612. in the French tongue, and is in the possession of the Lords of that
Manor.

Wingfield.
Wingfield College.
Here sometimes stood a College or Chantrie, by whom founded I have not yet
found out. But the de la Poles, Earls of Suffolk, were the Patrons of it.
Valued it was at the dissolution to amount to fifty pounds three shillings five
pence half penny, of yearly revenues. Surrendered 36 H. 8.

Will. de la Pole (...) of Suf^olke.
In this College was buried the body of William de la Pole, Lord Wingfield,
Earl, Marquess, and Duke of Suffolk, as also Earl of Penbroke. After all
these honors given him, he was banished England for five years, for being too
familiar with Queen Margaret, privy and consenting to the yielding and loss
of Aniou and Main (as also to appease the murmuring of the people for the
murdering of the Duke of Gloucester) and as he was ^aking of ship to pass for
France, he was surprised and taken on the sea, by a ship of war, called the
Nicholas, belonging to the Duke of Exceter, then Constable of the Tower of
London, and there presently beheaded, and his body cast into the sea, which was
after found, and taken up again at Dover, brought to this College, and here
honorably interred, says Hall, as also the Catalogue of Honor by Brook.
This happened in the year 1450.

(...) de la P^le (...) of Suf^^lke.
John de la Pole son and heir of William aforesaid, after the death of his
Father Duke of Suffolk, was likewise buried here at Wingfield. Of which he was
Lord and owner. He died in the year 1491.

In the Parish Church are these Inscriptions or Epitaphs.

Of these Cottons I have read as follows. In the pedigree of Edmund Cotton
Esquire now living, 1631.
The ancient seat of the Cottons in Cambridgeshire is, Lanwade Hall: many
descents were higher, and before the father, to the elder, Sir John Cotton
knight, who died near the beginning of Queen Elisabeth. This Sir John (being
the elder) had three brothers, whereof Edmund Cotton was the third from Sir
John aforesaid, and sisters they had, etc. This elder Sir John Cotton had one
son called by his fathers name, sir John Cotton Knight, who dying in the time
of King James, left to inherit his estate, one only Son (begotten of his
wife Anne, eldest daughter of sir Richard Hoghton, of Hoghton Tower in the
county of Lancaster, Knight and Baronet) now in being: whose name is likewise
John.

Edmund Cotton, the third brother aforesaid, married Ela Coniers, the daughter
and heir of John Coaniers, the only son of Robert Coniers Knight, of near
alliance to the Lord Coniers of Hornby Castle in Richmondshire, who lived in
the several reigns of Ed. 2. and Ed. 3. A sister of the forenamed Robert
Coniers, Knight, was married in that time to Sir Richard Harpley knight, and
now lies interred in the Chancell of Barton magna, under a monument, inscribed
as before: Hic iacet corpus Alicie, etc.

Edmund Cotton, aforesaid, by Ela his wife, had diverse children; George was his
eldest son, and Audery, a daughter of his, veiled her self a Nun. George
had issue, many children, and Edmund was his eldest son and heir. Edmund
Cotton in like manner, had issue, diverse sons and daughters, and his eldest
son and heir is Edmund Cotton, now in being. The ancient seat left unto him,
amongst other lands, was called by the name of Coniers, alias Necton Hall in
Bramble Barton, alias Barton magna iuxta Bury S. Edmonds.

Debenham.
Here lies John Farmingham, who died.... 1424. and Margaret his wife.

Robert Cheake, and Rose his wife.

George Neuill, and... his wife.

John Neuill. John Cheake, who died, 1490.

Babewell.
The foundation of Babewell Priory.
Here sometimes stood a Monastery of Gray Friars, first founded by master Adam
de Lincoln, who gave the Foundership to the honor of Clare. Here lay buried,
Sir Walter Trumpinton, and Dame Anne his wife.

Nicholas Drury, and Jane his wife, which died the seventh of MArch, in the
seventh year of King Richard the second. Margaret Peyton.

Blithborrow.
^nna, King of the East Angles, and Ferminus his son.
This little Town is memorable, for that Anna, King of the East Angles,
together with his eldest son and heir apparent Ferminus, were here buried,
both slain in a bloody fierce battle, by Penda the Mercian King, a Pagan:
of which my old Manuscript.

Penda anon his host with him he led;
And on Anna came first with mykle pride
King of Este England, Egfrid, King of (...).
whose dowter Egfryde wed
And slew him.
Anna was a man of great virtue, Lib. (...) Hist. 3. cap. 18.
and the father of a blessed issue, says Bid, which were many, and those of
great holiness and sanctity of life. First, Ferminus, slain in the same
battle with his father, as I have said before; here buried, but afterward
removed to S. Edmundsbury. His other son was Erkenwald, Anna his issue.
Abbot of Chertseie, and Bishop of London, of whom before. His daughters were
these. Etheldred, Etheldred, Abbess of ^^ly.
the eldest, was first married unto a Noble man, whom Bid names Tombert
Governor of the Fenny Countries of Norfolk, Huntington, Lincoln, and
Cambridge shires. And after his death, remaining a virgin, she was married to
Egfrid, King of Northumberland, with whom likewise she lived in perfect
virginity, the space of twelve years, notwithstanding his entreaty and
allurements to the contrary. From whom lastly she was released, and had license
to depart his Court, unto the Abbey of Coldingham, where first she was veiled
a Nun under Abbess Ebba, and thence departing, she lived at Ely, and became
her self Abbess thereof; wherein lastly she died, and was interred; remembered
unto posterities by the name of S. Audrie, of whom, more hereafter.

His second daughter was Sexburgh, S^^burgh Abbess ^f ^ly.
who married Ercombert, King of Kent, unto whom she bare two sons, and two
daughters; after whose death, she took the habit of a Nun, and succeeded her
Sister Etheldrid, Abbess of Ely, Whitgith a Mench^on.
wherein she died, and was interred. And their youngest sister Withgith, was
likewise a Menchion with them in the same monastery, and all of them canonized
for Saints.

Ethilburghe, Ethilburge Abbess of Be^king. Bed^.
his third daughter, was made Abbess of Berking in Essex, built by her brother
Bishop Erkinwald, wherein she lived, and lastly died, as I have said before.

A natural daughter likewise he had, whose name was Edelburgh, Edelburge,
Abbess (...) B^igges in France. Bid.
that with Sedrido, the daughter of his wife, were both of them professed Nuns,
and succeeded each other Abbesses in the Monastery of S. Brigges in France.
Such a reputed holiness was it held in those days, not only to be separated
from the accompanying with men, Speed cap. 11.
but also to abandon the country of their nativity, and as strangers in
foreign lands, to spend the continuance of their lives.

The founda^ion of the Priory of black Canon^.
This Town was beautified by King Henry the first, with a college of black
Canons, who granted the same as a cell to the Canons of Saint Osiths in Essex:
Her revenues were augmented by Richard Beauveys Bishop of London, who is
reckoned as a cofounder with the said King: the value of it was 48 pounds, 8
shillings, 9. pence.

Mettingham.

Sir John, surnamed de Norwich, Lord of this place, built here a four square
Castle, and a College or Chantrie within it, which he dedicated to the honor
of God, and the blessed Virgin Mary, which was valued at the suppression to be
yearly worth in lands, two hundred, two pounds, seven shillings five pence
half penny, which was surrendered the 8 of April, 33 Hen. the eight.

Brusyerd.
Bursyerd or Brusyerd a Nunnery.
A Monastery of Nuns, dedicated to the blessed Virgin, by whom ^ounded, or in
whose time, I have not learned: valued it was at 56 pound two shillings and a
penny, per annum, and surrendered the 17. of February, in the thirtith year of
King Henry the eight.

VVangford.
(...) found^ti^n of Wangford P^^o^y.
Here sometimes stood a Priory or a Cell of black Monks Cluniakes, dedicated
to the honor of the Virgin Mary, founded by one Ansered of France, valued at
the suppression, to be worth thirty pounds, nine shillings, five pence by
year, and surrendered the sixteenth of February, 32 Hen. 8.

Bungey.
The foundation of the Nunnery of Bunge^.
Here was a Nunnery founded by Roger Glanuil and Gundreda his wife, or as others
say, by the Ancestors of Thomas de Brotherton Earl of Norfolk: valued at the
downfall of religious houses, at sixty two pounds, two shillings, and a
penny, and of it I know no further.

Sotterley.
Toward the uppermost end of the Chancell of this Church, lies a large
Grauestone, with two full proportioned pictures in brass, and this Inscription
at the feet of them. The Playsere and Anne his wi^e.


Orate pro animabus Thome Playsers Armigeri, nuper huius Ecclesie Patroni, et

Sir Tho. Cornwalleis knight, and Anne his wife.
On the North side of the Isle near unto the former monument stands a marble

Armor, and Anne his wife.....

Of these two, and of the family of Cornwalleis, thus Camden writes, Camd. in
Su^^.
concurring with the words in these Inscriptions. At Brom, says he, dwelt a
long time the Family of Cornwalleis, of knights degree: of whom Sir John
Cornwalleis was Steward of Edward the sixth his household, while he was Prince:
and his son Sir Thomas, for his wisdom and faithfulness became one of the
privy Council to Queen Mary, and Controllour of her royal House.

Here also in the said Isle is a Monument, Hen. Cornwalleis
whereupon is the Effigies of Henry Cornwalleis Esquire, in Armor kneeling
thus under written.

Flixton.
Or Felixton (so named of Felix, the first Bishop of these parts, like as many
other places in this Shire) had in times past a Monastery of Nuns, of whose
Foundation I have read in a namelesse Manuscript, as follows.

The foundation of Flixton Nunnery.
Margery de Creke daughter to Galfride Hanes, the widow of Bartholomew Creke,
gave her whole Manor of Flixton, with all the appurtenances, which came to
her by Inheritance, to have a Religious house of Nuns erected, which should
profess the Rule of Saint Austin. Simon de Wanton at that time Bishop of
Norwich, Sir William Blunde, Robert de Valines, William de Medef^nd, being
witnesses of her donation and gift: which was in the reign of King Henry the
third; for I find that in his time these witnesses did flourish. It was valued
at the general overthrow of such houses, at twenty three pounds four
shillings, penny, half penny qua.

Walton or Waletune.
The Priory of Walton.
A Priory dedicated to Saint Felix the Bishop before remembered; wherein were
placed black Monks Benedictines. And this is all I find of this Foundation,
save that the Bigots or Bigods Earls of Norfolk, were great benefactours to
this religious building; if not the sole Founders of the same. As will appear
by this piece of a Record following.

A Monastery was here founded by Peter de la Roche, or Petrus de Rupibus, that

Cnobersburg or Burgh Castle.
Which as Camden says out of venerable Bede, was a most pleasant Castle, by
reason of the woods and sea together, wherein a Monastery was built by Furseus
a holy Scot; Sigebert king of the East Angles a Monk. His death.
by whose persuasions Sigebert king of the East Angles became a Monk, and
resigned up his kingdom: who afterward being drawn against his will out of
this Monastery, to encourage his people in battle against the Mercians,
together with his company, lost his life. In that place now there are only
ruinous walls, in form as it were four square, built of flint stone and
British brick. But the story of the Foundation of this Abbey will best appear
in the life of Furseus, written by Bid, and followed by Capgraue. Bid lib 3.
cap. 19. Capgraue lit. F. folio 153 as follows.

In the time that Sigebert yet governed the East parts of England, a holy man,
The f^unda^^^on of the M^nasterie of (...).
called Furseus, came thither out of Ireland, a man notable both for his
sayings and doings, of great virtue, and much desiring to wander and travel in
Gods quarrel, wheresoever occasion served. Coming therefore to the east
coasts of England, he was reverently received of the said King, where pursuing
his godly desire of Preaching the word of God, he both converted many
Infidels, and confirmed the faithful in the faith and love of Christ, by his
painful Preaching, and virtuous examples. Where falling into sicknesses, he
had from God a vision by the ministry of Angels, wherein he was warned to go
forward cheerfully in his painful Preaching of the Gospel, and to persevere
in his accustomed watching and praying, because his end and death was certain,
though the hour thereof was most uncertain, according to the saying of our
Lord. Watch therefore, ye know not the day nor the hour. With this vision
being much confirmed and encouraged, he hastened with all speed to build up the
Monastery in the place king Sigebert had given unto him, and to instruct it
with regular discipline. This Monastery was pleasantly situated for the Woods
and Sea adjoining, being erected in the village of Gnobersburg, and enriched
afterward by Anna, King of that province, and many other Noble men, with
sundry fair houses, and other ornaments. This Monastery was founded about the
year of our Lord, 636. and demolished long before the violent deluge of such
buildings, which happened in the reign of King Henry the eight.

Gorlston.
Gorl^^oe Fri^^^
Here I saw, says Camden, the tower steeple of a small suppressed Friery, which
stands the Sailers in good steed for a mark: of which Friery I never marked
further.

Lestoffe.
Tho Scroop^, a Bishop in Ireland.
Here lies buried the body of Thomas Scroope, otherwise surnamed Bradley, of
the town wherein he was borne, descended of the noble family of the Scroopes,
Qui claritatem generis literis et virtutibus plurimum illustrabat: who very
much adorned the honor of his birth, by his learning and virtues. He was first
a Monk ordinis Sancti Benedicti, of the order of Saint Benet: after that, ad
maiorem aspirans perfectionem, aspiring to a greater perfection of life, he
took upon him the profession and rule of a Dominican, and after that, he
submitted himself to the discipline of the Carmelites, (of whose Institution
he writ a learned Treatise) and preached the Gospel in hair and sackcloth
round about the Country. Then he withdrew himself again to his house of
Carmelites in Norwich, and there remained twenty years, leading the life of an
Anchorite, but yet after that time, he came abroad, and was advanced by the
Pope to a Bishopric in Ireland, called Dromorensis Episcopatus, the said Pope
(which was Eugenius the fourth) sent him in embassage to the I Will of Rhodes (of
which he writ a book) from whence being returned, he left Ireland and his
Bishopric, came into the East countries, wherein he went up and down
barefooted, teaching in towns abroad, the ten commandments, and preaching the
glad tidings of the Gospel. Quicquid autem vel ex suis reditibus percepit, vel
alias a ditioribus lucrari poterat, id totum aut pauperibus distribuit aut in
alios pios vsus erogauit: whatsoever he took, either of his own yearly
profits, or what he could procure from the richer sort of people; he
distributed it all to the poor, or employed it to pious uses. At the length,
Anno aetatis suae plus minus centesimo in Leistoft Suffolciencis comitatus
oppido viuendi finem fecit, in the year of his age, one hundred or
thereabouts: he died in this town of Lestoffe, the fifteenth day of January,
in the year of our Lord, 1491. the seventh of Henry the seventh. Here he was
buried, cum Epitaphio Elegiaco, with an Elegiacall or sorrowful Epitaph,
engraven upon his monument: two of the last verses of which, are these two
verses following.

Venit ad occasum morbo confectus amoro;
Spiritus alta petit, pondere corpus humum.
If you would know more of this learned Irish Bishop, read Bale and Pitseus in
his life.

Somerley.
The habitation in ancient times of Fitz-Osbert, from whom it is come lineally
to the worshipful ancient Family of the Iernegans, Knights of high esteem in
these parts, says Camden in this tract.

Upon an ancient Knight (says the same Author in his Remains) Sir Iernegan,
buried cross legd at Somerley in Suffolk, some hundred years since is
written.

Jesus Christ, both God and man,
Save thy servant Iernegan. Sir Iernegon or Ierningham.

This Knight, as I gather by computation of years, was Sir Richard Ierningham
or Iernegan, who for his staid wisdom, was chosen to be one of the privy
Chamber to King Henry the eight, upon this occasion following.

Certain Gentlemen of the privy Chamber, Stow Annal. An. reg. Hen. 8.10.
which through the Kings lenity, in bearing with their lewdness, forgetting
themselves, and their duty toward his grace, in being too familiar with him,
not having due respect to his estate and degree, were removed, by order taken
from the Council, unto whom the King had given authority to use their
discretions in that behalf, and then were four sad and ancient Knights put
into the Kings privy Chamber, Ric. Wingfield. Ric. Ierningham Ric. Weston.
Will. Kingstone, Knights.
whose names were Sir Richard Wingfield, Sir Richard Ierningham, Sir Richard
Weston, and Sir William Kingstone.

Or it may be, Sir Robert Ierningham, knighted by the Duke of Suffolk, Charles
Brandon, at the battle, and yielding up of Mont de dier, a town in France.

But which of the Family soever he was, the name has been of exemplarie note
before the Conquest; if you will believe thus much as follows, taken out of
the Pedigree of the Ierninghams, by a judicious gentleman.

Anno M.xxx. Canute, King of Denmark, and of England after his return from
Rome, brought diverse Captains and Soldiers from Denmark, whereof the
greatest part were christened here in England, Ierningham.
and began to settle themselves here, of whom, Iernegan, or Iernengham, and
Iennihingho, now Iennings, Iennings.
were of the most esteem with Canute, who gave unto the said Ierningham,
certain royalties, and at a Parliament held at Oxford, the said King Canute
did give unto the said Ierningham, certain Manors in Norfolk, and to
Iennings, certain Manors lying upon the seaside near Horwich in Suffolk, in
regard of their former services done to his Father Swenus King of Denmark.

Snape.
The foundation of Snape P^^^ry.
A Priory of black Monks, and a Cell to Colchester, founded in the year,
1099. the twelfth of William Rufus, by William Martill, and Albreda his wife,
and Geffrey Martill their son and heir, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and
valued in the Kings books to be yearly worth, ninety nine pounds, one
shilling, eleven pence half penny.

Hoxon.
The (...) of H^^on.
In times past called Hegilsdon, and much ennobled by reason of the Martyrdom
in this place of Edmund, King of the East Angles, enshrined sometimes in the
Abbey of Bury, as I have spoken before, honored by his name, to whose
holiness, a Monastery was erected in this place.

Wykes.
This was a Monastery of Nuns, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, founded by King
Henry the third, The foundation of Wykes Monastery.
or at least wise by him confirmed, as it is in the Records in the Tower:
valued at fourscore and twelve pounds, twelve shillings, three pence half
penny of yearly commings in.

Neyland.
The manufacture of Clothing in this County, has bin much greater, and those
of that trade far richer, I persuade my self, heretofore then in these
times, or else, the heirs and executors of the deceased, were more careful
that the Testators dead corpse should be interred in more decent manner, then
they are now a days; otherwise I should not find so many marbles richly
inlaid with brass, to the memory of Clothiers in foregoing ages, and not one
in these latter seasons. All the monuments in this Church which bear any face
of comeliness or antiquity, are erected to the memory of Clothiers, and such
as belong to the mystery.

Upon the Pauement before the high Altar lies an ancient Grauestone, having
thereon the figure of a Knight in complete Armor, resting his Head upon his
Gauntlet, with this circumscription.

of the Arms thereof, are most impiously stolen away, and so is the Brass of
the Inscriptions, Arms, and Images of three other fair stones lying there

sometime wife unto the right high and mighty Prince Lord John Howard Duke of
Norfolk, and mother unto the right noble and puissant Prince, Lord Thomas
Howard, Duke also of Norfolk. Which Lady departed this present life, Ann. Dom.

In the South part of the said Church between the high Altar and the Quier is
a monument (with this similitude and subscription, aforementioned) of the right
honorable Lady Katherine, daughter of William Lord Molins, the first wife of
John Howard Duke of Norfolk, who was the son of Sir Robert Howard, and of

Sir Io. Peyton Knight.
Under another marble stone adjoining, his son Sir John Peyton knight, lies
inhumed with this French Inscription.

Camd. in Cambridgeshire.
These Peytons had their mansion at Peyton Hall in Boxford not far hence. Of
which and of them Camden. Wicken came to the family of the Peytons, says he,
by a daughter and coheire of the Gernons about Edward the thirds time, as
afterward Isleham descended to them by a coheire of Bernard in Henry the sixth
his time: which knightly family of Peytons flowred out of the same
male-stocke, whence the Vffords Earls of Suffolk descended, as appears by
their coat armor, albeit they assumed the surname of Peyton, according to the
use of that age, from their Manor of Peyton Hall in Boxford in the County of
Suffolk.

Dodnash.
The foundation of the Monastery of Dodnath.
A Monastery dedicated to the honor of our alone Savior Christ, and the
blessed Virgin his mother; founded by some of the Ancestors of the Earls or
Dukes of Norfolk. Valued at forty two pounds eighteen shillings eight pence
half penny.

Sibbeton, or Sibton.
(...) founda^^^^ of Sibton. ^^^ey.
William Cheney, or William de Casineto, who held the Baronie of Horsford in

the Virgin Mary, and therein placed black Monks Cistertians; which was
valued at the suppression to be yearly worth two hundred fifty pounds,
fifteen shillings, seven pence, half penny.

Redlingfield.
The Foundation of the Priory of Relingfield.
In this Parish was a religious House of black Nuns, dedicated likewise to
the Virgin Mary, and founded by one Manasses de Guies. Valued at fourscore
and one pound two shillings, five pence half penny.

Rendlesham.
Howsoever there be no Inscriptions here upon any of the Grauestones in the
Church, Rendlesham a Town of great note in former times.
yet questionless in former times it has been beautified with the Funeral
Monuments of many worthy Personages. For, here Redwald king of the East Angles
kept usually his Court, who was the first of all his Nation that was baptized,
and received Christianity: but afterward seduced by his wife, Beda li. 2. ca.
25.
he had in the self same Church, as says Bid, one Altar for Chirsts
Religion, Camd. in Suff
and another for sacrifices unto Devils. In this place also Swidelm a king of
these East Angles was likewise afterward baptized by Cedda Bishop of London.

Redwald having reigned king of the East Angles one and thirty years, Speed ca
19. Redwald, Swid^lm, kings of the East Angles.
and Monarch of the Englishmen eight years, died in the year of our salvation
six hundred twenty three. And (by supposition) he as also Swid^lme lie buried
at this place.

Ratisford.
An Hospital dedicated to Saint John, Ratisford Hospital.
valued at thirty three pounds ten shillings. Of which I have read no further.

Rombuth, or Rombrughe.
A Priory of black Monks dedicated to Saint Michaell. Rombrughe.


Saint Genouefa Fernham.
This village is in this regard memorable, Camd. in (...) John Textor.
for that Richard Lucy Lord chief Justice of England, and Protector of the
kingdom in the absence of king Henry the second, took prisoner here in a
pight field, Robert surnamed Blanchmame, Earl of Leicester, together with his
Amazonian proud Countess, Burialls at Fernham.
Petronell, or Pernell; and withal put to the sword above ten thousand
Flemmings, which the said Robert had levied and sent forth to the depopulation
of his country: all, or the most, of which number, were buried in and about
this the foresaid village of Fernham, in the year of our redemption, 1173. in
the twentieth of Henry the second.

Of the valourous atcheeuements and pious actions of this worthy Knight, and
religious Votarie, I have related somewhat before within the Diocese of
Rochester, where I write of the dissolved monastery of Lesnes, an Abbey of his
Foundation, where in the place where the Church thereof sometime stood (which
had lain a long time buried in her own ruins, and grown over with Oak,
Elm, and Ashe-trees) certain workmen appointed, by the owner of the manor,
Sir John Epsley knight, to dig amongst the rubbish of the decayed Fabric
for stones, happened upon a goodly Funeral monument, Sir Rich. Lucie found
buried in the Abbey of Lesnes. Ann. 1030.
the full proportion of a man, in his coat armor cut all in freestone; his
sword hanging at his side by a broad belt, upon which the Flower de luce was
engraven in many places (being as I take it the Rebus or name-deuise of the
Lucies) this his representation or picture lay upon a flat marble stone; that
stone upon a trough or coffin of white smooth hewn Ashele^ stone, in that
coffin, and in a sheet of lead, ^ both being made fit for the dimension of a
dead body;) the remains of an ^^h^e dry carcass, lay enwrapped, whole and
vndisioynted, and upon the head, some hair, or a simile quiddam of hair
appeared: they found likewise other statues of men, in like manner
proportioned, as also of a woman in her attire and abiliments, with many
grauestones and bones of the deceased; to see all which, great confluence of
people resorted, amongst which number, I was not the hindmost.

BIsus the fourth Bishop of the East Angles, The division of the Diocese of
the East Angles.
waxing old and sickly, divided his Diocese into two parts; whereof the one
he appointed to be the Jurisdiction of a Bishop that should have his See at
North Elmham in Norfolk: in the other at Dunwich aforesaid he continued
himself, as also did others of his Successors, to the number of eleven.

Elmham pagus obscurus et ignobilis: Elmham the Bishops ^eate. Baldwin the
first Bishop.
an obscure little village, and of no estimation, says Harpsfield, Saecul. 8.
cap. 9. was thus honored and enriched with the residence of many reverend holy
Bishops, successively from Baldwin who was the first, until by reason of the
great troubles of those times in the Danish wars, this See, as also the other
at Dunwich, stood void almost an hundred years, until King Edwy, the twenty
ninth Monarch of the Englishmen, about the year 955. preferred one Athulfe to
this Bishopric of the East Angles, who governed the whole Diocese alone, and
constantly kept his abode here at Elmham aforesaid; after whom succeeded
Alfrid, Godwin. Catal.
Theodred, and Theodred, Athelstan, Algar, Alwyn, Alfricke, and Alfrey, after
him Stigand, who enjoying the place but a short time, was deprived; the like
happened to Grinketell his successor, who being convicted to have used
unlawful means in obtaining this Dignity, was likewise deprived, and Stigand
restored to it again. From whence he was advanced to the Sea of Winchester,
and after to the Archbishopricke of Canterbury; and being so preferred, he
found the means to procure this Bishopric of the East Angles, unto Egelmare
his brother. All these Bishops until the time of William the Conqueror, had
their Sees here at Elmham.

The said Conqueror substituted his Chaplain Arfastus in the place of
Egelmare, The^ford the Bishops seat. Arfastus the first Bishop.
by whose advice the Sea was translated from Elmham to Thetford, a man very
unlearned, and of no extraordinary parts at all: being Chaplain to the
Conqueror, who was then but Duke of Normandy, he would needs make a journey to
Becco in Normandy, where Lanfranke (afterward Archbishop of Canterbury) was
then Abbot, as also where Arfastus had been a Monk, and well esteemed of for
his learning, because that before Lanfranks coming, he was Luscus inter
Strabones amongst a number of drones merely unlearned, Godwin out of Ma^msbury.
only a little smattering of learning he had, with which he made a fair show.
But now by this time, by Lanfranks means, the monastery of Becco was become
even a very University, flourishing with all knowledge of good letters.

Hither Arfastus coming, after a pompous and bragging manner, attended with a
great troop: Lanfranke, who by and by at the first blush espied Arfastus his
ignorance, caused an Abcee to be laid before him, ferociam hominis Italica
facetia illudens, mocking the pride of the man with an Italian witty jest:
which jest or ieering scoff, Arfastus so took to heart, as he never lynne
till he had caused the Duke to banish Lanfranke out of Normandy. Howbeit when
Lanfranke came to take his leave of the Duke, happening to ride on a lame jade,
the Duke fell into such a laughter, at the halting of his horse, as in that
merry mood, by means of some friends, he was quickly reconciled to him
again. This Bishop died about the beginning of the reign of King William
Rufus.

William, the ^^st Bishop of Thetford, and the first of Norwich.
Upon the death of Arfastus, one William Herbert, surnamed Galfagus, for the
sum of a thousand and nine hundred pounds, obtained of the said King William
Rufus, this Bishopric for himself, and the Abbacy of Winchester for his
father: for satisfaction of which Simony, this penance was enjoined him by Pope
Paschalis the second, that he should build certain Churches and Monasteries,
which he religiously performed. This Town of Thetford having bin first sacked
by Suenus the Dane, who in a rage set it on fire, in the year 1004. and six
years after, spoiled again by the furious Danes, so that it had lost all the
beauty and dignity that formerly it had; this Bishop did all he could to
adorn and set it out; but being unable belike, to do so much as he intended,
he removed his Seat from hence to Norwich, being a city as then very fair
built, spacious, and eminent, where he first erected a Cathedral Church at his
own charges, as does appear by the sequel.

Norwich. S. Trinities, the Cathedral Church.
HErebertus dictus Losinga, Abbas quondam Rameseie, The foundation of the
Bishops See at Norwich.
qui sedem Thedford a Rege Willelmo emerat in Anglia magnus fuit Simonie ^omes
hic postquam erroneum inuentutis impetum deste^issit, Romam iuit ac rediens
sedem suam vsque Norwicum transtulit, vbi et celebre fundauit Monasterium de
rebus quidem proprijs non Episcopalibus: sed et apud Tedford Monachos
cluniacenses instituit, hic septus dicere consueuit. Erranimus inuenes.
Emendemus senes: thus much out of an old Manuscript of the Abbey of Euesham,
anciently put into English by the Translator of Polychronicon, as follows.

Abowte that time, Herbert, the first Bishop of Norwich
Herbert Losange that had been sometime Abbot of Ramsay, and was then Bishop of
Tedford, was a great noury for Simony, for he had boughte the Bysshopryche of
the King. But after ward he was sorry, and bywept the unskillful rest of his
youth. And took the way to Rome* and came home again, and changed and turned
his See from Tedford to Norwyche. And he founded a solemn Abbaye with his
own catayle, and not with the catayle of his Bysshopryche. But at Tedford he
ordained Monks of Cluny that were rich in the world, and clear of Religion to
Godward: And had often in mind the word of Iherom, That said, we erryd in our
yougth, amend We us in our age. His repentance does also appear by the
context of his Charter, beggining thus.

In nomine Patris et ^ilij and Spiritus sancti, Amen. Herbertus Episcopus,
Cart. Antiq. in Arch. Turris Land.
infirmitatis and impuritatis proprie conscius, ante iustum and clementem

His donations to this his mother Church of Norfolk and Suffolk, follow,
which are many and great, for he endowed it with as much lands, as might
sufficiently maintain threescore Monks, who had their fair and spacious
Cloisters. But after they were thrust out by King Henry the eight, there were
substituted for them, a Deane, six Prebendaries, and others.

Witnesses to this his Charter, were King Henry the first, and Maud his Queen;
eleven Bishops, and four and twenty Earls, Lords, and Abbots: to every name,
the sign of the cross.

Facta est hec donatio Anno Domini M.C. ordinatione Gregorii Episcopi Romans apud

The first stone of this religous Structure, was laid by Herbert himself, in
the year after Christ's nativity, one thousand ninety six: with this
inscription.

Dominus Herbertus posuit primum Lapidem,
In nomine Patris, Filij, et Spiritus Sancti.
Amen.
That is.

Lord [Bishop] Herbert, laid The First Ston
In The Name of The Father, The Son,
And holy Ghost. Amen.
Godwin de (...) Ang. Ma^^s de gest. Regum Ang. lib. 4.
This Bishop was borne at Orford in Suffolk, his Fathers name was Robert de
Losing. He was Prior of the monastery of Fiscane in Normandy, and came back
into England at the request of William Rufus, and living in the Court for a
time, behaved himself in such sort, that he was much favored of the King,
and obtained diverse great preferments at his hands, whereby it came to pass,
that within the space of three years, he had so feathered his nest, as he
could buy for his Father, the Abbacy of Winchester, and for himself, the
Bishopric of Thetford, which I have partly touched here, and in another place.

Having finished this pious Fabric, according to his mind, he then
determined to build an house for himself (for as yet he had none in Norwich,
the Sea being so lately removed from Thetford) and therefore on the north side
of the Church, he founded a stately palace. And more (such was his repentance
for his Simony committed) he built five Churches; one over against the
Cathedral Church, on the other side of the river, called S. Leonards, another
in this City also, another at Elmham, a fourth at Linne, and a fifth at
Yarmouth. He was an excellent Scholar for those times, and writ many learned
Treatises, mentioned by Pitsaeus, in his book de illustribus Anglie
Scriptoribus Aetat. duodecima: where he calls him, vir omnium virtutum, et
bonarum literarum studijs impense deditus, mitis, affabilis, corpore venusto,
vultu decoro, moribus candidus, vita integer.

A man earnestly addicted to the studies of all virtues and good learning;
mild, affable, comely of personage, graceful of countenance, blameless in
his carriage, pure, innocent, and sincere in the course of his life. The Monks
of Norwich made great means and suit to have this Herbert a canonised Saint,
but such impediments were always in the way, that it could not be obtained.

He departed this life the two and twentieth of July, in the year of grace, one
thousand, one hundred and twenty, and was buried in this Church of his own
Foundation, by the High Altar, to whose memory, these verses following were
engraven upon his monument.

One Euerard, Euerard, Bishop of Norwich.
who next succeeded Herbert, lies here interred; who although, says Godwin,
he enjoyed this Bishopric for a long space, yet time the deuorer of all
things, has left nothing of him to our remembrance, but that when he had
governed his Church 29 years, he ended this life, October. 15. 1150.

Here in the Presbytery lay buried the body of Bishop Turbus, Will. Turbus,
Bishop of Norwich.
a Norman by birth, being in his youth, a Monk, and afterward Prior of this
monastery. In his time, this Cathedral Church was burned by casual fire, he
died in the 25. year of his consecration, the 17. of January.

Near unto the high Altar, Io. Oxford, Bishop of Norwich.
lies buried the body of John of Oxford, sometimes Deane of Salisbury, and
Bishop of this Diocese. This man finished the Church which Herbert (being
prevented by death) had left unperfected, and repaired that, which by fire was
lately defaced. He built diverse Hospitals for impotent and diseased people. He
founded Trinity Church in Ipswich, and reedified diverse houses which were by
fire decayed. He was chaplain to King Henry the second, and with him, in
especial favor, ever firmly adhering to his party against Thomas Becket,
who had stubbornely opposed himself against his said Sovereign Lord and
Master. He was employed in diverse Embasies, as to Rome, to Seines in France,
and to Sicily, about the marriage of Ioane, the third and youngest daughter of
the said King Henry, to William, the second of that name, King of Sicill, Duke
of Apulia, and Prince of Capua. In the soliditie of good doctrine, in the
maturitie of judgment, and in all the graces of rhetorical speech, he did
wondrously abound. He was quick and dexterous in the managing, and prosperous
in the dispatching of weighty affairs. Pits. aetat. 13.
He writ a History of the Kings of Britain, as also a Book, Pro Rege Henrico
contra S. Tho mam Cantuariensem, for King Henry against S. Thomas of
Canterbury, besides, a treatise of his journey into Sicily, and certain
Orations and Epistles to Richard, Archbishop of Canterbury.

He died the 26 year of his consecration, the second of June, in the second
year of King John.

John de Gray, Io. Gray, Bishop of Norwich.
entirely beloved of King John, who preferred him to this Bishopric, was here
entombed: in whose commendations, Bale and Pitseus do in effect, thus agree.
Vir erat foelici et faceto ingenio, eruditione insignis, consilio expeditus, et
quantumuis in dictis facetus, in factis tamen, vbi res postulabat, senerus,
virtutum omnium amator et cultor, omnium vitiorum osor et exterminator. Iohanni
Anglorum Regi gratissimus, in magna semper authoritate apud ipsum remansit,
splendidis functionibus ornatus.

A man he was of a pleasant and facetious wit, in the knowledge of all good
literature excellent, in counsel ready and intelligent, and howsoever in his
words merry and iocond; yet in his actions, as occasion did require, he was
severe and rigorous: a lover and reuerencer he was of all virtues, and a
despiser and rooter out of all vices.

He was a gracious Favorite to King John, ever under him in great authority,
and honored with offices of especial trust and confidence. Na^^ cum Rex
rebels Hibernos compescuisset, eorumque vires fregisset, hunc Gra^ium tanquam
virum strenuum magnae prudentiae, fidelitatis exploratae, reliquit ibi supremum
Presidem, vt eos auctoritate sua in officio contineret. For when the King, had
repressed the rebellious Irish, broken and dispersed then forces; he left this
Gray as an hardy able man, of singular wisdom, and tried fidelity, Prorex
or Lord Deputy of Ireland, that by such his power and commission, he might
keep that stiff-necked nation in obedience.

He was well seen in the laws of the Realm, says Godwin, wise and of great
integrity; De praesul. Angl.
in regard whereof the King was very desirous to have made him Archbishop of
Canterbury (of which I have spoken somewhat before) to which Grace indeed he
was solemnly elected, and his election published in the Church before the King,
and an infinite number of people: But by the exorbitant authority of the Pope,
this election was disanulled, whereupon much mischief ensued. He built that
goodly Hall at Gay wood near Linne in Norfolk, and the rest of the Fabric
adjoining. Having sat about fourteen years, he died near Poytiers in his
return from Rome: Obijt eodem anno quo Rex Johannes, says Bale, in the same
year in which King John deceased, the first of November. Whose body was
conveyed to this his own Church. He was an Historiographer, and writ a book
which he called Schalecronicon, as also other works mentioned by Bale in his
Centuries.

Walter de Sufield Bishop of Norw.
Die vero Sancti Vlstani decimo tertio Calendas Iunij, obijt Episcopus
Norwicensis Vualterus cognomento de Sufeld apud Colecestriam, and del^tum est

Upon the Feast day of Saint Wolstan, the thirteenth of the Calends of June,
Walter surnamed de Sufield, Bishop of Norwich departed this world at
Colchester, from whence his body was conveyed to this Cathedral Church, here
to be honorably interred. At whose Tomb many miracles are reported to be
wrought, which are ascribed to his holiness; For it is remembered of him, that
in a time of extreme famine he sold all his plate, and distributed it to the
poor every pennyworth. He lies buried in our Ladies Chapel, which was of
his own building. He founded the Hospital of Saint Giles here in the City,
The foundation of Saint Giles Hospital.
endowing it with fair possessions, insomuch that it was valued at the
suppression to be yearly worth fourscore and ten pounds twelve shillings.

Si. de Wanton Bishop of Norw.
Simon de Wanton, sometimes the Kings Chaplain, one of his Justices, and
Bishop of this Diocese, was here interred by his predecessor, Walter de
Sufield. He died about the year 1265. having sat eight years, and obtained
of the Pope license to hold all his former livings in Commendam for four
years.

In the same Chapel, as I take it, Roger de Sherwyng was entombed, who died
about Michaelmas, Rog. (...) Bishop of Norw.
1278. having sat thirteen years. Of whom I find little remarkable; yet he
is memorable, for that in his time by an incendiarie outrage, the Citizens set
fire on the Priorie Church. The story is thus delivered by our late writers,
taken out of Rishanger, the Continuer of Matthew Paris his History, in the last
year of King Henry the third.

About the month of June, in a Fair that was kept before the gates of the
Priory, there fell great debate and discord betwixt the Monks of Norwich and
the Citizens there; which increased so far, that at length the Citizens with
great violence assaulted the Monastery, fired the gates, and forced the fire so
with reed and dry wood, that the Church with the books and all other ornaments
of the same, and all houses of Office belonging to that Abbey were clean
burned, wasted, and destroyed, so that nothing was preserved except one little
Chapel. The King hearing of this detestable and sacrilegious deuastation,
rode to Norwich, where beholding the deformed ruins, he could hardly refrain
from tears: and caused inquiry to be made of the fact; whereupon thirty young
men of the City, as also a woman that first carried fire to the gates, were
condemned, hanged, and burnt.

It is thought, says Hollinshead, that the Prior of the house, whose name was
William de Brunham, was the occasion of all this mischief, who had got
together armed men, and took upon to keep the Belfray and Church by force of
arms; but the Prior was well enough borne out and defended by this his Bishop.
The Monks for their part appealed to Rome, and so handled the matter, that
they not only escaped punishment, but also forced the Citizens to pay them
three thousand Marks, after five hundred Marks a year toward the reparation
of their Church, besides they were adjudged to give to the use of the Church,
Vnam cuppam de pondere december librarum auri, and valor centum librarum argenti,
A Cup weighing ten pounds in gold, and worth an hundred pounds of money.
Whereby you may note, says Speed, the proportion then between the value of
gold and silver. This end was made by King Edward the first (his Father being
now dead) at the request and solicitation of this Bishop.

His next successor William Midleton was also interred in this Church. ^
He reedified the same, being so destroyed and profaned as you have heard
before, and hallowed or consecrated the whole Fabric anew in the presence of
King Edward the first, and many of his Nobles. He departed this life the last
of August, Ann. 1288. in the eleventh year of his Consecration.

John Salmon, John Salmon Bishop of Norw.
placed in this See of Norwich by the Pope, was here entombed; he was Lord
Chancellor of England for the space of four years. This Bishop built the
great Hall, and the Chapel in the Bishops palace, and a Chapel at the West
end of the Church, in which he ordained four Priests to sing Mass
continually. He died July the sixth 1325.

William Ayermin likewise by the Popes authority was preferred to this
Bishopric, Will. Ayremin Bishop of Norw.
as appears by the sequel.

Cum summus Pontifex nuper Willelmum tunc Canonicum London in Episcopum
Norwicens. prefecisset. sicut per literas bullatas ipsius summi Pontisicis Regi

prefectionem and receptionem predict. mandat restituere ei Temporalia. Test
Rege apud Kenelworth, 13. December. Pat. 20. E^^ 2.

In the year 1319. says F. Thin, in his Catalogue of Englands Chancellours,
and out of an old anonimall Latin Chronicler, this Will. Ayremin was keeper of
the great Seal, and that he was taken prisoner by the Scots: the words of his
Author are in effect thus in English.

The County of York and the country adjacent having received inestimable
damages by the Scots, William de Melton, Archbishop of York, John Hotham,
Bishop of Ely and Treasurer, the Abbot of Saint Mary's York, Sir William
Ayremin Priest, Chancellor of England, Deane of York, the Abbot of Selbie,
and Sir John Pabeham knight, assembled together an army of eight thousand to
repress the violence of the enemy; this army consisted of Clerks, Monks,
Canons, and other spiritual men of the Church, with Citizens, and Husbandmen,
and such other unapt people for the wars. With these, the Archbishop came
forth against the Scots, and incountred with them at a place called Mitton, a
little village upon the River of Swale. Over which River the Englishmen were no
sooner passed, but that the expert warlike Scots came upon them with a wing in
good order of battle, in fashion like to a Shield, eagerly assayling their
enemies, who for lack of good government were easily beaten down and
discomfited, without showing any great resistance. Corruerunt ex nostris tam in
ore gladij quam aquarum scopulis suffocati plusquam quatuor mill hominum;
there were slain by the sword and drowned in the River of our party above
four thousand persons, says the Manuscript, and the residue shamefully put to
flight.

The Archbishop, the Bishop of Ely, the Abbot of Selbie, and diverse other, with
help of their swift horses, escaped. The Mayor of York named, Nicholas
Fleming was slain. Et capti sunt Domini, Johannes de Pab^ham miles, and
Dominus Willelmus de Airemin, Canc. and Sir John de Pabeham, and Sir William
Ayremin Priest, were taken prisoners.

John Harding who seldom gives condign praise to the valiant doughtie Scot;
thus writes of this battle.

C^p ^^3.
...... in Myton medowe nere
To Swale water, lay then with great power

Upon the bishop suddenly with Scots issued
And xv hundredth English there he slew
And home he went with king Robart full glad,
With prisoners many, mo then men knew
The Bishop fled fro the field full woo bestad
With his Clerks, that then were full mad.
This was called the white Battle, for that it consisted of so many Clergy
men.

This Bishop died March the 17. having sat almost eleven years, at Sharing
near London, whose body was conveyed for burial to this his own Church. He
gave two hundred pound for order to be taken that two Monks (the Cellerers of
the Covent) should always sing Mass for his soul.

Thomas Piercy was here interred, Tho. Piercy Bishop of (...)
a gentleman, howsoever right honorably descended, and highly befriended, yet
constrained to admit of this Bishopric, by the Popes Prouisorie Bull, as
follows.

This Bishop gave unto the repairing of this Church (which in his time was
greatly defaced with a violent tempest) the sum of four hundred marks, and
obtained of the rest of the Clergy a great sum to the same purpose. He
bequeathed to the Chaunter of this his Church, an house and certain lands
lying within the Lordship of Kimerle, Gaeriton, Fowrhow, Granthorpe, and
Wychelwood, upon condition he should procure Mass daily to be said for his
soul. He died at Blofield not far off, the eight of August, 1369.

Upon the death of Bishop Percy one Henry Despenser, Hen. Spenser Bishop of
(...).
Canon of Salisbury, was preferred by the Pope to this Bishopric: as I find
it thus recorded in the Tower.

Henricus Despenser Canonicus Saresburien per Papam ad Episcopatum Norwicen.

fidelitate, and habuit restitutione^ Temporalium. T.R. apud Clarendon 14. Aug.

This man was called the warlike Bishop of Norwich, for that in his youth he
had been a Soldier with a brother of his, one Spenser a gentleman, greatly
esteemed for his valor, being a chief Commander in the Popes wars: by whose
means this Henry obtained this dignity; and having changed his vesture but
not his conditions, in what manner of life he spent his youth, in the same he
most delighted, even in his waxing years. For in the year 1381. most
memorable was the service of this stout Bishop against the rebellious bondmen
and Pesants of Norfolk, whom he drove out of their Trenches, slew diverse, and
caused their mushrom king John Littestar to be hanged, drawn, and headed; and
also caused all others that were the chief agents in that rebellion to be put
unto death, and so by that means quieted the whole country: an action
(howsoever some will say perhaps, not agreeable to his calling) worthy of
eternal honor and remembrance.

Not long afterward, viz. 1383. he had another occasion to show his martial
prowess: for being drawn on by Pope Urban the sixth, to preach the Crusado,
and to be general against Clement the seventh (whom sundry Cardinals and great
Prelates, Tho. Walsing. in vita R. 2.
had also elected Pope) having a Fifteenth granted to him for that purpose by
Parliament, (after strong opposition of almost all the Nobles, who resisted
this business of the Cross) went with forces into Flanders, to support the
cause of Urban, against the Antipape Clement, from whence after he had
performed many exploits very happily, taken Graueling, Burbrough, Dunkerke, and
Newport, by assault, and bin victor in a set Battle against thirty thousand
abettours of Clements claim; he was enforced to return, as destitute of those
further succors which were expected out of England. But the King, upon
pretense that he had not obeyed his royal Mandate, by which he required him,
(before he transported) to return, for a while seized upon all his
Temporalities; to which he found grace with the King to be restored, at the
special suit of Thomas Arundell, as then Bishop of Ely. The which Seisin and
Restitution is thus in effect recorded.

There was great contention between this Bishop and his Monks, for the space
of fifteen years; but they being too weak for him (as you see all his
opposites were) at last were glad to give him four hundred marks to enjoy
their privileges in like sort as heretofore they had done. He sat Bishop well
near 37. years, and died August 23. 1406. as appears by this mangled Epitaph
upon his monument.

kept him from his temporalties, but also imprisoned him almost a whole year at
Windsor.

Io. Wakering, Bishop of Norwich.
Before the Altar of Saint George, the body of Bishop Wakering lies buried, who
for his life, learning, and wisdom, was highly esteemed: in regard whereof,
(before he was advanced hither to Norwich) King Henry the 4. made him Lord
Keeper of the privy Seal, and so consequently, he was of his privy Council,
in the year 1414. he was sent to the general Council holden at Constance in
Heluetia, Hollins. A. 2. H. 5.
with Richard, Earl of Warwick, the Bishops of Salisbury, Bath, and Hereford,
the Abbot of Westminster, and the Prior of Worcester, with diverse other Doctors
and learned men of the spirituality, besides Knights and Esquires, in number
all, eight hundred horses, so well appointed and furnished, as well the men, as
horses, that all nations meruailed to see such an honorable company come from
a Country so far distant: in this Counsel he so behaved himself, that for
learning and wisdom, he obtained the general applause of all the assembly;
shortly after his return, he was consecrated Bishop, viz. the last of May,
1416. and having his charge with great praise about nine years, he died the
ninth of April, one thousand, four hundred, twenty and five. He built the
Cloister which is to be seen at this day in the Bishops Palace, pauing the
same with stones of diverse colors.

Upon the door under the Rood loft, I find this maimed Epitaph following,
inlaid in brass.

This man in the catalogue of Bishops is called Walter Heart. In his
predecessors days, the Citizens here of Norwich harboring in their minds
their old grudge, attempted many things against the Church, but such was the
singular wisdom and courage of the said Bishop, whose name was Thomas Brown,
that all their enterprises took little effect: and now by the policy and
discretion of this Lighert, or Heart, the malicious humors of these
malecontented Townsmen, before reasonable well allaied, was altogether
extinguished. He paued the Church, and during his life, maintained twelve
students at Cambridge, with all things necessary for them at his own charges.
He departed this life the first of May, 1472. as appears by his Epitaph in the
twenty and sixth year of his consecration, and lies buried near unto the
Rood loft, which he himself erected.

Here lies buried the body of James Goldwell, Ia. Goldwel, Bishop of Norwich.
sometimes Deane of Salisbury, Secretary to King Edward the fourth, and Bishop
of this Diocese, who died in February, M.cccc.lxxxxviii.

This Bishop was a great repairer or new builder of great Chart Church in Kent,
where (as it is said) he was borne.

Here lies buried the body of Thomas Ian, Tho. Ian. Bishop of Norwich.
who died the first year of his consecration, viz. anno 1499.

(...) of Norwich.
After the decease of Ian, Richard Nix succeeded, of whom I find little worth
the rehearsing (says Godwin in his Catalogue of Bishops) he has the report
of a vicious and dissolute liver; was blind long before his death, sat 36
years, and died, An. 1536.

It is reported yet, that this Bishop built the north cross I Will of this
Church, and gilded the roof of the same, upon which his cote of Arms is to
be seen.

In the Chapter House was a goodly monument to the memory of Sir Thomas Windham
knight, with this (now maimed) Inscription.

^

This Knight lies buried in the Chapter house under a goodly fair monument,
if it were not so much defaced. He received the order of knighthood from the
hands of Sir Edward Howard, ^
Lord Admiral of England the fourth of King Henry the eight, at Croiton Bay in
France. He did good service at the winning of Turney and Turwin, as also in
other places; this has been a name of exemplarie note and knights degree at
Cowtherke in this Tract for many descent.

Richard Brom.

On the wall by him is a monument with his atchieuement, cut, with helm,
coat, mantle and creast: his Creast is a bonch of broom green, with golden
flowers on a wreath.

Next him, lies under an arched monument, the body of one Bosuile, or Boswell,
(...) Boswell.
sometime Prior of this Church, with this Inscription on the upper part of the
Arch.

O tu qui transis, vir, aut mulier, puer an sis
Respice picturas, apices lege, cerne figuras:
Et memor esto tui; sic been disce mori.
Under it, are three pictures of dead men's skuls, one with teeth, another
without an upper chappe, and only two teeth in the nether; and the third
without either chaps or teeth, between each of which is written, O morieris. O
morieris. O morieris.

The Family of Bosvile is very ancient, far branched, and of knightly
degree, as it will appear in many places of these my ensuing labors: The
^amilie of Bosvile o^ Boswell.
of which in this place, and upon this occasion, I will only give a little
touch.

In the Church of Seuenoke, within the County of Kent, remain the achiuements
and Funeral rights of Raphe Bosvile of Bradburne in the said Parish of
Seuenok, Esquire, Clerk of her late Majesty's Court of Wards and Liueries,
Grandsier of Sir Raphe Bosvile, now of Bradburne, and Sir Henry Bosvile, of
Eynsford in the foresaid County, Knights, descended lineally from the Bosviles
of Erdsley, and Newhall in the County of York.

The inhabitants of Seuenoke say, that whilst the said Raph Boswell lived,
being employed upon many occasions for the public; he deserved and had the
reputation of a most worthy Patriot, and out of his particular to their Town,
he procured of Queen Elizabeth a Charter of Incorporation, for the settling
and government of Lands formerly given for the maintenance of a Free-schoole,
and thirteen Almes-people in the said Parish. For the more entire
establishment whereof, Sir Raph his Grandchilde, cooperating with other noble
friends in so charitable a suite, obtained an Act of Parliament in the 39. of
Queen Elizabeth, besides other benefits procured by him in behalf of this
Corporation and Parish. Whereupon a well wishing versifier alluding to the
Creste of this Family, which is an Ox coming out of a Grove of Oaks, took
occasion to express his affection in this Distich.

Dij tibi dent Bosville boues villasque Radulphe,
Nec Villa careat Bosue, vel Illa boue.
Here lies under a fair marble stone, one of the ancient Family of the
Cleres, Clear and his wife.
and his wife, as appears by their Arms thereupon engraven, for the brass is

Under a monument in the South Cross Isle lies one Baconthorp a Prior of this
Church, Baconthorpe Prior.
the Inscription is worn or torn out of the stone.

I will not say that this Prior was John Baconthorp, Io. Baconthorpe the
resolute little Doctor.
the Resolute Doctor who flourished in the reign of King Edward the third. For
I find that he was buried amongst the Carmelites at London; howsoever he was
borne at Blackney in this County, brought up at Oxford and Paris in France; and
so exceeding deeply learned he was as well in Divinity, as in both the Civil
and Canon Laws, that he proceeded Doctor in either faculty, in both the said
Universities, and got the surname Doctoris resoluti, or Resolute or Resolving
Doctor; Nemo doctius consundebat Iudaos; nemo neruosius consutabat Turcos, vel
quoscunque infideles; nemo falicius ex pugnabat haereticos; nemo solidius
Christi veritatem dilucidabat; nemo manifestius Antichrists falsitatem and
imposturas detegebat, suisque coloribus deping^bat; nemo subtilius difficiles
nodos soluebat; nemo clarius obscura sacrae scripturae loca explanabat, and
sensus reconditos and arcana mysteria dilucidius apperiebat.

No man more learnedly confounded the Jews; no man more pithilie confuted the
Turks, or any other Infidels; no man more prosperously convinced the
Heretics; no man more solidly declared the truth of Christ; no man more
manifestly discovered the deceits and iuglings of Antichrist, nor so painted
him out in his proper colors; No man more subtly resolved hard questions;
and never any man more clearly expounded, explaned, or laid more apertly open,
the hidden sense, the secret mysteries, and the obscure places of the sacred
Scripture, Pit. Ann 1346.
says Pitseus.

Baconthorpe a Dwarf.
He was like another Zacheus, little of stature, but immense in wit and
understanding, insomuch as it was a wonder to know so many virtues inhabit
together in so small a mansion. He writ so many exact learned Volumes, that his
body could not bear what his wit brought forth. Nam, si moles librorum cius,
composita sarcina, auctoris humeris imposita fuisset, homulum sine dubio
comprimere suffecisset. For, if the bulk or pile of the books which he writ,
had been put into a bag, and laid upon his shoulders, questionless it would
have pressed the slender short dwarf to death, says my foresaid Author.

Much more might be said of this little-great man, but I am called for my
self to the Press; and to speak more then I have done in the praise of
little men, I may be thought to flatter my self.

He died in the year 1346. in the twentieth of the reign of King Edward the
third, I read in a book of the order of Carmelites (of which Fraternity he
was one, as also Provincial of them all throughout all England) penned by John
Bale before his conversion, a part of an Eulogium composed to the memory of
this Baconthorpe, which may serve for an Epitaph. Thus.

Upon a fair marble stone in the Quire this Inscription following is engraven
in brass.

Sir William Bolen knight of the Bath.
Hic iaces corpus Willelmi Boleyn militis, qui obijt x. Octobris, Anno Dom.
M.ccccc.v. Cuius anime propitietur Deus. Amen.

Let it be the greatest honor to this noble deceased Knight, for that he was
great Grandfather to the most renowned and victorious Princess Elizabeth, late
Queen of England, which will best appear by the Light of Great Britain,
learned Camden, in his Introduction to the History which he writ of her long
and prosperous reign: beginning as follows.

The Lineage and descent of Elizabeth Queen of England (says he) was by her
Fathers side truly Royal: for daughter she was to King Henry the eight, grand
daughter to Henry the seventh, and great granddaughter to Ed* the fourth. By
the Mothers side her descent was not so high: howbeit noble it was, and spread
abroad by many and great Alliances throughout England and Ireland. Her great
grandfathers father was, Ieffrey Bolen, a man of Noble birth in Norfolk, Lord
Mayor of the City of London, in the year 1457. and at the same time honored
with the dignity of Knighthood. An upright honest man, of such estimation,
that Thomas Lord Hoo, and Hastings, Knight of the Order of Saint George, gave
him his daughter, and one of his heirs, to wife; and of such wealth, as he
matched his daughters into the Noble houses of the Cheineys, Heydons, and
Fortescues, left his son a goodly inheritance, and bequeathed a thousand
pounds of English money to be bestowed upon the poor in the City of London,
and two hundred in Norfolk. This man's son William Bolen was chosen amongst
eighteen most choice Knights of the Bath at the Coronation of King Richard the
third: to whom Thomas Earl of Ormond (who was in such favor with the Kings of
England, that he alone of all the Nobleman of Ireland, had his place and voice
in the Parliaments of England, and above the Barons of England also) gave his
daughter and one of his heirs in marriage. By her (besides daughters married
to Shelton, Calthorp, Clear, and Sackvill, men of great wealth and noble
descent, and other children) he begat Thomas Bolen, whom being a young man,
Thomas Howard Earl of Surry, who was afterward Duke of Norfolk, a man much
renowned for his worthy service, and atchiuements in the wars, chose to be
his son in law, giving unto him his daughter Elizabeth in marriage: and Henry
the eight, after he had performed one or two very honorable Embasies, made him
first Treasurer of his Household; Knight of the Order of Saint George, and
Viscount Rochford, and afterward Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond, and made him
Lord Keeper of the privy Seal. This Thomas, among other children, begat Anne
Bolen, who in her tender years being sent into France, attended on Mary of
England, wife to Lewis the twelfth; and then on Claudia of Britain, wife to
Francis the first; and after she was dead, on Margaret of Alencon, who with the
first favored the Protestants Religion springing up in France. Being returned
into England, and admitted amongst the Queens Maids of Honor, and being
twenty two years of age, King Henry in the thirty eight year of his age, did
for her modesty, ^empered with French pleasantness, fall deeply in love with,
and took her to wife, by whom he had issue Elizabeth aforesaid Queen of
England.

The brag of the clock.
Horas significo cunctas quas Phebe diebus
Quas solet atque tua pallida nocte Soror
Nec magis errarem Rector mihi si foret idem,

In English.

Phoebus I tell all th'houres, and all as right
As thou, or thy pale Sister, day and night,
Nor I no more then you in ought should err
If he ruld me, who guides you, and each star.
For times I rightly tell, to me of's Art,
If my learnd keeper will his help impart.
Tho. Scot, Philo.
In imitation of this, it may be that Thomas Scot, in his Philomythie, makes a
Clock to compare with a Dial, and the difference to be partly decided by the
Wethercocke: of which a little, although not much to the purpose I confess.

Upon a Church, or steeples side near hand,
A goodly Clock of curious work did stand;
Which ouerpaysde with lead, or out of frame,
Did time miscall, and every hour misname.
The Dial hearing this, aloud began cry,
Kind neighbor Clock, your glib tongue tells a lie.
Reform your error, for my Gnomon says
You gad too fast, and miss an hours faith.
Fool (quoth the Clock,) reform thy self by me,
The fault may rather in thy Gnomon be.
Had thou told ever truth, to what end then,
Was I placed here, by thou art of cunning men?
The Weathercocke upon the steeple standing,
And with his sharp eye, all about commanding,
Heard their contention, wild them to appeal
To him the chief of all that common weal.
Told them that he was set to ouersee,
And to appease, to guide, and to agree,
All difference in that place; and whatsoere
He sets down, from justice cannot err.
This my ingenious Author does veil under the Clock, the teaching part of the
militant Church, which consists of the Clergy. Under the Dial, the written
word, and under the Weathercocke, the Pope of Rome.

Now hear a word or two of the name Hoar. Verst. in our english names of

I find, says Verstegan, this anciently written Hure, and I find Hure, to
be also used and written for the word hire; and because that such incontinent
women do commonly let their bodies to hire, this name was therefore aptly
applied unto them.

It is in the Netherlands written Hoer, but pronounced Hoor, as we yet
pronounce it, though in our later English Ortography (I know not with reason)
some write it Whore.

I find many of this surname of good note, and special regard in many places
of this kingdom.

The Austine Friars founded by one Remigius, or by the King, but by what King,
or to what Saint dedicated, or to what value it amounted, I do not know: Others
say it was founded by one Roger Mynyoth.

Amongst many other of this Fraternity, I find that one Benedictus Icenus, or
Benet of Norfolk, a Brother of this House, and of this Order of Saint
Augustine, was likewise here buried in the Chapter house: who died in the year
of our salvation, 1340. Vir pius, prudens, facundus, omni serentiarum genere
nobiliter instructus, et cum primis sui temporis Theologis merito conferendus. ^
A man godly, wise, fluent of speech, in all kinds of Sciences nobly
instructed, and right deseruingly to be compared with the prime Divines of his
days. For his singular grace in preaching, and his able power in persuading,
he was so beloved of Antony Beck, the Bishop of this Diocese, as that he made
him Suffragane, or as it were Copartner with him in his Episcopal function.

The Gray Friars was founded by one John Heslynford, The G^ey Frie^s.
and of this Foundation I find no further.

Some say that the Black Friars was founded by King Edward the second, which,
The Bl^^ke Friars.
I confess, I cannot contradict. For I find no otherwise neither of the
Foundation, the time, dedication, order, nor value, only my Notes from Master
Le Neue tell me, that these persons following were in the same interred.

In the Manuscript of this Religious Order (before remembered) written by John
Bale, these Carmelites following are registered to have been buried in this
Monastery: I will use his Latin.

Frater Vmfridus Necton, obijt, 1303.

Vmphrey Necton.
This Necton was Doctor of Divinity in Cambridge, and Professor. Erat vi^
solid doctus, disputator subtilis, Concionator vehemens: He was a man solidly
learned, a subtle disputant, a very earnest Preacher, says Pitseus; Of whom
Leland has left this Distichon.

Laudibus Humfredum meritis super astra feramus,
Cui data Grantenae laurea prima scholae.
He writ diverse books mentioned by Bale, as also by Pitseus.

Frater Andreas Felmingham.

Frater Robertus Walsingham, obijt 1310.

To. ^alsyngham.
This Walsingham, says Pitseus, was Vir acuti ingenij, solidi iudicij, bonae
vitae, magnae doctrinae: A man of an acute wit, a sound judgment, a good life,
of great learning. And Bale speaking of him, says, He was a man of great
repute in the University of Oxford for his Quodlibets, ordinary questions, and
his Interpretations of the sacred Scriptures, which he made manifest to the
world.

Frater Galfridus Mylsam obijt anno Dom. 1346. 5. Ianuar.

Frater Adam Saxlingham.

Frater Johannes Folsham Prior Prouincialis Anglie, obijt 1348. April 8.

(...). Folsham.
This Folsham proceeded Doctor of Divinity in Cambridge; Pitseus gives him his
praise in a grave style, Bale (ironically) says, that indeed he was a Doctor,
and none of the meanest: for, by his chopping of Logic he could turn black
into white, men into Asses, and Schoole-diuinitie into natural Philosophy. He
writ many learned works.

Frater Robertus Rose, obijt 16. December. 1420.

that they honored him with the title of supreme Master. He writ much, yet
never offended the VVickleuists, he lived long, and enricht his Monastery, many
as well in estate, as with diverse kinds of Sciences.

Frater Johannes Thorpe, Doctor ingeniosus, obijt 12 Augusti, 1440.

This Thorpe writ many books, as well Divine as humane: but for one he was
most remarkable, which he entitled, The Laborinth of Logic, wherein he
showed so exquisitely the subtle Elenchs of that Art, that thereby he gained
the surname of Ingenious Doctor. Which with his Epitaph was engraven upon his
Tomb.

In the years 1348. from the first of January, A grievous great plague in
Norwich.
to the^ first of July, there died in this City of Norwich fifty seven
thousand one hundred and four persons, besides religious Votaries. Whereupon
the Prior and Covent of this house, devised a Prayer for the deliverance of
certain Carmelites out of Purgatory, which died in that contagious sickness,
as follows.

Deus immense bonitatis, A prayer for the deliverance of certain Carmes out of
Purgatory. Ex Mss. Balei de Carmelitis.
ac sempiterne clementie, pietatis affectu pro alijs rogare cogimar, qui pro
nostris peccatis nequaquam sufficimus; confisi tamen de tua gratuita
benignitate humiliter deprecamur, vt per meritum passionis vnigenitiatque
dilecti filij tui Jesus Christi, and per merita piissime matris eius, ac omnium
Sanctorum, atque Sanctarum, animas Fratrum nostrorum, and omnium fidelium
defunctorum, a penis liberare digneris, qui liberasti tres pueros de Camino
ignis ardentis, et de manu Regis iniqui. Per eundem Christum Dominum nostrum.
Amen.

Now here to make an end of the Funeral Monuments which I find in this famous
City, as also to take my leave of the same, may it please you run over these
verses of John Ionston a Scottish Britan, penned in the praise of the foresaid
City of Norwich.

The praise of Norwich. Vide Camden.
Vrbs speciosa situ, nitidis pulcherrima tectis,
Grata peregrinis, delitiosa suis.
Bellorum seeds, trepido turbante tumultu,
Tristia Neustriaco sub duce damna tulit.
Victis dissidijs, postquam caput ardua coelo
Extulit, immensis creuit opima opibus.
Cultus vincit opes, et cultum gratia rerum,
Quam been, si luxus non comitetur opes
Omnia sic adeo sola haec sibi sufficit, vt si
Fors regno desit, haec caput esse queat.
Thus translated by Philemon Holland, Doctor of Physic.

A City seated daintily, most fair built she is known,
Pleasing and kind to strangers all, delightful to her own.
The seat of war, whiles civil stirs, and tumults yet remaind,
In William the Normans days, she grievous loss sustaind.
These broiles and iars once past her head aloft again
She bare, in richness infinite, and wealth, she grew amain.
Her port exceeds that wealth, and things all superfine, this port
How happy were it, if excess with such wealth did not sort.
So alsufficient in her self, and so complete is she,
That if need were, of all the Realm, the Mistress she might be.
Attilborrough.
The foundation of the College of Attilborrough.
The Book of Woodbridge says, that Sir William Mortimer Knight, Lord of this
Manor, here founded a Chapel of the holy Cross, who died on Tuesday the 12
of November, 1297. and was buried in this his own Chapel: others say that
Sir Robert Mortimer, and Margery his wife, were the founders of a College
here, which they likewise consecrated to the honor of the holy Cross, valued
in the Kings books, at twenty one pounds, sixteen shillings, half penny.

Burials at Attilborrough.
Burials in the Chapel of this College, were as follows. Sir William
Mortimer, as before: Sir Robert Mortimer, who died at Attilburgh, the 25 of
September, 1387. Sir Thomas Mortimer: Mary Falstalph, who was wife to Sir
Thomas Mortimer, who died the second of May, 1406. Sibill Mortimer died the 9
of November, 1334. Margery Falstalphe, daughter of... died 24. of October,
1341. Constantine Mortimer, Father to Constantine, who died 12 November, 1334.
Sir John Radcliffe, knight of the Garter, in the reign of Henry the sixth:
Roger his brother, and Philip his wife: Thomas Brampton, Robert Wetnall. Alice
Warner. Elisabeth, wife of Thomas Garret, Esquire.

Of this Village, and the foundation of the College, thus Camden writes.
Attilborrough, says he, the seat of the Mortimers, an ancient family, who
being different from those of Wigmore, bare for their Arms, a shield Or, Seem
de flowers de Lyz Sables, and founded here a Collegiat Church, where there is
little now to be seen: the Inheritance of these Mortim^rs, has by marriage
long since accrued to the Radcliffes, Sir Alex. Radcliffe of Ordsall now owner
of Attilborro^ Anu. 1031.
now Earls of Sussex, to the Family of Fitz-Ralph, and to Sir Ralph Bigot: it
is the inheritance at this day of Sir Alexander Radcliffe of Ordsall, in the
County of Lancaster, knight of the Bath.

Windham.
William d Albiny, The foundation of the Priory of (...) Ex (...). Land.
Butler to King Henry the first, founded here a Priory, of which, thus much out
of his Charter, as follows.

Notum sit. etc. quod Ego Willelmus de Alben^yo Pincerna Domini Regis Henrici
primido concedo, etc. Priori et conuentui de Wymundeham in liberam, puram, et
perpetuam eleemosinam pro salute anime me, et vxoris me patris mei and matris
me, et omnium parentum meorum totam Ecclesiam de Wymundeham cum omnibus
pertinencijs, etc. Test. Rog. Bygoth, et filij eius, etc.

He endowed this his religious edifice, with fair possessions, consecrated it
to the blessed Virgin Mary, placed black Monks therein, and gave it to the
Abbey of Saint Albans for a Cell: it was valued in the Exchequer, to be yearly
worth seventy two pounds, five shillings, four pence.

From a Cell to Saint Albans, The Priory made an Abbey.
it was advanced to an Abbey, upon the occasion following set down by John
Wheathamstead.

John, the seventh of that Christian name, Abbot of Saint Albans, could not
endure a certain Monk of the house, whom he had made Archdeacon, whose name
was Stephen London, because he would tell him sometimes of his faults.

Ordine septenus dum rexit ouile Johannes,
Et baculum gessit, Io. Whe^onssea^ Mss. in b^b. C^t.
cetumque gregis benedixit,
Nunquam pacifico been cernere sciuit ocello
Quend^m confratrem quem fecerat Archileuitam.
Therefore to be rid of his company, whose looks and admonishments were so
distasteful, the Abbot persuades the Archleuite or Archdeacon to take upon him
the charge of this Priory of Windham, as then void of a Governor, in these or
the like words.

Ecce Prioratus Wymundam nomine dictus,
Iam vacat absque patre, vacans stat et absque Priore:
Huic te prefecimus, in prepositumque creamus,
Cur se disponas ^ilec cito quoque pergas,
Est lacus insignis apud et nos grandis honoris.
The Archdeacon Stephen accepts of this promotion, which is thus in ^he said
Manuscript expressed.

Aduertens Frater quod erat sibi victricus alter,
Pastor et ille sibi quasi prenignus stomachanti,
Censuit expediens per tempus vt absoret absens,
Quam m^l^ sub curuo sic viuere semper ocello,
Illius in plac^^um necflexum cernere vultum;
Pergere consensit elluc properans et adiuit.
This Stephen pleased both his flock and Founder, wondrous well, but
displeased his Father the foresaid Abbot, John of S. Albans, who within the
year, sent express commandment to discharge him of his Priorship, which was
hainously taken both by himself and his Patron or Founder, whose name, ^
says my Author, was one Andrew Ogard.

Miles preualidus, miles locuplesque peritus.
In so much, that they joined in petition to the Pope, that it would (...)
Holiness, that the Abbey of S. Albans might have no jurisdiction (...) the
Priory of Windham, that the Priory might be altered into an Ab^^^, and that the
Prior thereof might ever after be honored with the title (...) Abbot; which
was granted, as you may read in these subsequent verses.

Optinuit tandem Prior Abbas vt sit ibidem
Ac Abbathia que cella prius fuit vna,
Istius Eccelesie, sic migrauit sine fine
Non sine dedecote dicti Patris que rubore.
The time of this alteration was in the beginning of the reign of Henry the
fourth, as it is explained thus by the said Whethamstead.

M. semel, quinus, C quater tune fuit annus,
De tanto demptis numero tantummodo binis,
Cum fuerant facta iam dicta priusque peracta,
Ista modo celle retractio pre recitate;
Tunc exeunte septeno Patre Iohanne
Et Fundatore famoso milite valde
Ogard Andreas fuerat qui nomine dictus;
Stephanus et London Abbas qui primus ibidem.
Burials at (...).
But now at length (for I have been too long holden in this brable) to come to
the burials in this Abbey Church.

First, the Founder, William de Albeney, Earl of Arundell, upon whose
Monument, this Epitaph was engraven.

Hunc Pincerna locum fundauit, et hic iacet, illa
Quae dedit huic domui, iam sine fine tenet.
He died the third year of King Henry the second.

William de Albeney, son of the said William, Earl of Arundell, he died at
Wauerley in Surrey, the fourth of the Ides of October, 1176. VVillelmus comes

William Albeny, the third Earl of Arundell and Sussex, who went with Richard
the first into the Holy Land, and remained with him in Almania all the time of
his imprisonment, and being full of years, died presently upon his return
with K. Richard, the day before the Nones of May, 1196. Hoc anno 1193. obijt

inheritor of his fathers honors and virtues, who together with Ranulph Earl
of Chester, Sayer de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, William Earl Ferrers,
Robert Lord Fitz^water, John Constable of Chester, and William Harecourt, with
a great train, took his journey to the Holy Land, and after the winning of
Damieta in Palestine in his return home wards, died the year 1221. at a
little town beyond Rome* called Kame^^ VVillelmus comes de Arundel rediens de

because he gave nothing to the Religious of this house, had this nicking
Distich made to his memory.

Hic situs est Nullus, quia nullo nullior iste; upon (...) None.

Et quia Nullus erat de nullo nil tibi christ.
Here lies None, one worse then none for ever thought,
And because None, of none to thee O Christ, gives naught,
I have read another Epitaph of this surname, but not so well rimed.

Hic recubat Nullus, nullo de sanguine cretus:
Nullus apud viuos, Nullus apud Superos.
None lies here, of lineage none descended
Amongst men None, None among the Saints befrended.
Reynham East.

Sir Rog Towneshead knight.
There is also a very fair Tomb of the son (as it seems) of the said John
and Elenor; for upon it are the same coats quartered as upon the other. It
has no Inscription, but in likelihood it is the Tomb of Sir Roger Towneshead,
one of the Judges of the Common Pleas in the time of King Henry the seventh.

Stratton*
Bardolfe.
On the North side of this Church there lies one buried in the wall under a
marble, upon which is the resemblance of a man crosse-legged, all in male
armor, his belt by his side, and other accoutrements of great antiquity: some
guess him to have been one of the Bardolfes. Barons of great Nobility in this
Tract, who flourished a long time in honorable estate.

Thornage.
Anne Lady Higham.
Here is a fair Tomb under which lies buried Anne Lady and wife of Sir
Clement Heigham knight, who died.... aetatis 84.

Higham a Town in Suffolk, which gives name to this worthy very ancient
family of Higham.

Lib. 2. cap. 16.
Michael Lord Montaigne in his Essay of Glory, writes that his Ancestors have
been surnamed Higham; I have no name, says he, that is sufficiently mine: Of
two I have, the one is common to all my race, yea and also to others. There is
a family at Paris, and another at Montpellier, called Montaigne, another in
Brittany, and one in Zantoigne, surnamed de la Montaigne. Lord Montaigne
surnamed Higham.
The removing of one only syllable may so confound our web, as I shall have a
share in their glory, and they perhaps a part of my shame. And my Ancestors
have heretofore been surnamed Heigham, or Hyquem, a surname which also belongs
to a house well known in England.

Sir William Butts knight, and his Lady.
Here is another Tomb on the South side of the Chancell, upon which is the
pourtraiture of Sir William Butts, in his complete armor kneeling, his sword
by his side, his spurs, his helmet at his feet. His Lady by him kneeling,
having her coat armor.

Here are the coats of Butts and Bacon quartered upon the Tomb; Arwerton,
says Camden in Suffolk, the house long since of the Family of the Baco^s who
held this Manor and Brom, by conducting all the footmen of Suffolk and
Norfolk from S. Edmunds-dike in the wars of Wales. These Bacons have at this
day their residence at Culfurth in Suffolk, Sir Nicholas Bacon knight and
Baronet.
a goodly house erected by Sir Nicholas Bacon knight, the first Baronet, son
unto that Sir Nicholas Bacon Knight, Lord Keeper of the great Seal of England;
Sir Nicholas Bacon Lord Keeper.
who for his singular wisdom and most sound judgment, was right worthily
esteemed one of the two supporters of this kingdom in his time. Who lies
entombed in S. Paul's with his two wives. Who died An. 1578. You may read this
Inscription upon the said Monument.

Hic Nicolaum ne Baconem conditum
Existima illum, tam diu Britannici
Regni secundum columen, exitium Malis,
Bonis Asylum, caeca quem non extulit
Ad hunc honorem sors, sed aequitas, fides,
Doctrina, pietas, vnica and prudentia;
Neu morte raptum creed: quia vnica breui
Vita perennes emerit duas, agit
Vitam secundam caelites inter animus,
Fama implet orbem, vita quae illi tertia est;
Hac positum in Ara est corpus, olim animi domus,
Ara dicata sempiternae Memoriae.
No less worthy of praise, Sir Francis Bacon Lord Chancellor.
for his many excellent good parts, was his son, who followed the fathers
steps; I mean Sir Francis Bacon knight, Lord Verulam, Viscount Saint Alban,
and Lord Chancellor of England, lately deceased.

Snoring.
Here under a fair Tomb lies the daughter of Sir John Heydon, who married
one of the Heninghams. These Heydons are an ancient race of Knights degree.

Blackney.
A famous religious house of Carmelite Friars in this late age aforegoing, The
foundation of Blackney Priory.
built and endowed by Sir Robert de Roos, or Rosse, Sir Robert Bacon, and Sir
John Bret Knights, about the year 1321. out of which came John Baconthorpe, of
whom I have spoken somewhat before. And now here give me leave to speak a
little more, which I had omitted, our of Camden. Camd in Norf.
A man, says he, in that age of such variety and depth withal, of excellent
learning, that he was had in exceeding great admiration among the Italians, and
commonly called the Resolute Doctor. The Resolute Doctor.
Whence it is, that Paulus Pansa thus writes of him.

If thy mind stand to enter into the secret power of the Almighty and most
merciful God, no man has written of his Essence more exactly. If any man
desires to learn the causes of things, or the effects of Nature; if he wish
to know the sundry motions of heaven, and the contrary qualities of the
Elements, this man offers himself as a storehouse to furnish him. The armor
of Christian Religion, of better proof and defense then those of Vulcans
making against the Jews, this resolute Doctor alone has delivered.

Always keeping house where rich and pore were fedd.

Even to the Grave, where Earth on Earth does ly:
On whose soul God grant of his abundant mercy.

Sir Roger Harsicke knight.
the son and heir of John, who lived in the eight year of King Henry the
fifth, and in the twenty ninth of Henry the sixth, in whom the issue male
ended, leaving his inheritance to his two daughters.

Sir Alexander Harsick released to the Monks of Castell-acre, the lands
granted by his Ancestors in the three and thirtieth of King Henry the third,
and of his own good will to the increasing of it, he gave the Sand pits, and
for the confirmation of the same grant he put to the Seal of his arms,
hanging at the parchment by a silk string: which manner of sealing was usual
in those days.

Castell-acre.
In the reign of King William Rufus, The foundation of the Abbey of Castle
Acre.
William Warren the second Earl of Surrey, founded here a Monastery of black
Monks Cluniakes, to the honor of God, and our blessed Lady, Saint Mary of
Acre, and the holy Apostles Peter and Paul,, and for the Monks of Saint
Pancrace there serving. Which Abbey afterward his son, and his sons son,
both named Williams, and Earls of Surrey, confirmed, ratified, and augmented.

Mortuo mare, or Mortimer, etc. To the second Charter Raph de Pauliaco, etc. To
the third, William Bishop of Norwich, who dedicated the Church, and many
others. Of which Charters, take a little touch out of authentical Records.

^
Radulphe de Torneio founded the Monastery of Canons in Westacre, which did
profess to lead a godly life after the example of the Apostles, as (...)
mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, where it is said, that the number of
^he^ that did believe, were all of one heart and one mind; and none of them
said that any thing which he had was his own, but they had all things in
common, and because (as in the Charter of his gift) he declares that the holy
Fathers did call this the canonical rule; affirming, that whosoever did lead
such a life, was thereby made a companion and Citizen with the Apostles.
Therefore he pronounces in his said Charter, that whosoever did infringe this
his donation, or alter, or change it into Monks, or into any other Order or
Rule, should be held accursed, etc.

Ingham, or Hyngham.
Under a fair Tomb of freestone very curiously wrought, Sir Oliver Ingham,
knight
lies the body of Sir Oliver Ingham, with his resemblance in his coat Armor,
his belt, gilt spurs, and the blew Garter about his leg; his Creast, the Owl
out of the Iuie bush, with a crown on the head thereof: He being a great
trauailer, lies upon a Rock, beholding the Sun, and Moon, and stars, all
very siue^y set forth in metal, beholding the face of the earth: about the
Tomb, twenty and four mourne^s.

Sir Oliver Ingham, Stow Annal. Hollins.
knight, whom the young Duke, Edward, had made keeper of Aquitaine, gathered a
great army, and invaded the Prince of Aniou (which the French King, contrary to
covenants, did with hold) and brought it wholly to the dominion of England,
anno Reg. Regis, Ed. secundi 19.

Bordeaux (the capital city of Aquitaine, Sp^ed. cap. 1^.
and then English) gave an excellent testimony of her loyalty, nor less of
martial wit and valor. For the French Army coming before her, she to abuse
their hope, set open her gates, and displayed upon her Powers, the golden
Lillies, as if she were theirs: but the French, which securely entered, found
little good hospitality. Sir Oliver de Ingham was Captain, and Lord Warden
there for King Edward, who with his Garrison-Souldiers, and aid of the
Inhabitants, slew of them, great multitudes, and preserved Bordeaux, anno Reg.

Saint Benets in the Holme.
The foundation of this religious structure is thus set down by learned Camden
in his chorographicall description of this County.

Then passes the river Thirn, The foundation of S Benets in the Holme.
says he, near the great decayed Abbey, called Saint Benet in the Holme:
which Knute the Dane built, and the Monks afterward so strengthened with most
strong walls and bulwarks, that it seemed rather a castle then a Cloister. In
so much that William the Conqueror could not win it by assault, until a
Monk betrayed it into his hands, upon this condition, that himself might be
made Abbot thereof, which was done accordingly: An Abbot of Holme hanged.
but forth with this new Abbot for being a traitor (as the inhabitants make
report) was hanged up by the Kings commandment, and so justly punished for his
treason.

After the first foundation of this Abbey by King Knute, her revenues were
greatly augmented, and her building enlarged by Edward the Confessor, and
Editha his Queen, with the consent of five Dukes, and of all, or the most of
the Lords spiritual and temporal within his kingdom, as it appears by his
Charter in Arch Turris Land. Cart. Ant.

It was dedicated to the honor of Christ and Saint Benedict, replenished with
black Monks Benedictines, and valued in the Exchequer, at six hundred
seventy seven pounds, nine shillings, eight pence, qua.

Clipesby.
Not far from the foresaid Abbey, Camd. in Norf.
is the Parish and Lordship of Clipesby, which gave name, says Camden, to a
family of ancient note in this tract, whereof there has been diverse Knights;
where after it had passed in the names of Algar, Elfled, and Odberd, all
surnamed de Clipesby, as appears by many vndated Deeds, which I have seen;
it came about the first of King John, to John de Clipesby, John Clipesby.
and from him lineally to the last John heir male of that line. On whose
Monument in this Church of Clipesby are empaled the Arms of Ierningham, John
Clipesby.
Woodhouse, Spelman, Paston, all Knightly families of that country, with whom
the Clipesbies had formerly matched.

By Julian a daughter and coheire of this last John, married to Sir Randall
Crewe, of Crewe in the County of Chester Knight, after Lord chief Justice of
England, the old surname of the Lord of this Manor was changed, but not the
blood. For, she left, besides a daughter, two sons; the eldest her heir
christened with the name of her paternall family; Clipesby, now Sir Clipesby
Crew Knight. She the said Julian died at Kewe in the County of Surrey, in the
year 1603. and was in the Chancell of the Church of Richmond, decently
interred, with this Inscription upon her Monument.

Antiqua fuit orta domo, pia viuit, iniuit
Virgo pudica Thorum, Sponsa pudica polum.
In this Church are diverse other Funeral Monuments for the Clipesbies, but so
defaced as neither Inscription nor coate-armes are remaining upon them, to give
me any further light.

Upon the side of a Tomb (the names of Roger Le Strange, and others of the

Hunstanton, says Camden, Camd. in Norf.
is to be remembered in this regard, if there were nothing else, for that it
has been the habitation of the Family of Le Strange, Knights by degree, ever
since that in the reign of Edward the second, John Baron Le Strange of
Knocking, gave the same unto Hamon his younger brother.

Hamon Le Strange the elder, Stow Annal.
performed great and good service for his Lord and Sovereign Henry the third,
against Simond de Montford Earl of Leicester, and his accomplices the 48. year
of the said Kings reign. He took upon him a voyage to the holy Land, as I
find it thus recorded.

brother of William de Warren, the second Earl of Surrey, in which he placed
black Canons; it was dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene: and valued upon the

pence.

This Abbey, says Camden, was the ordinary burial place in ancient time of
the Noblemen and Gentlemen in this tract.

These Inscriptions above written are depensild in the glass windows.

Here lies buried one More of Norwich, to whose memory, some wit of those
times, (but the time of his death I do not know) playing and making dalliance
with his name, made this Epitaph following.

More had I once, More would I have,
More is not to be had;
The first I.... the next is vain,
The third is too too bad.
If I had used with More regard,
The More that I did give,
I might have made more use and fruit
Of More while he did live.
But time will be recald no more,
More since are gone in brief.
Too late repentance yields no more
Save only pain and grief.
My comfort is, that God has More
Such Mores to send at will,
In hope whereof I sigh no more,
But rest upon him still.
Hempton.
A Priory of black Canons founded by one Richard Ward, who took upon him holy
Orders, and lived in this house of his own foundation, which he consecrated to
the honor of God, our blessed Lady, and Saint Stephen; it was valued at the
suppression, at thirty nine pounds, nine shillings.

Shornborn.
Here is an ancient monument in this Church to the memory of one of the
Shornborns or Shernburns, Shernburne.
but so foully defaced, as nothing remains to know the man who lies under it,
saving a Vulture splaid, which is the Crest of the Shernborns. Many other
Crests and Coat Arms are there also, Shernb^rn, the second Christian Church
of ^i is Country (...) by (...).
which I meddle little withal; yet to use Camdens words, I do not see how
this Church could have bin omitted, for that Foelix the Burgundian, (Bishop of
this Diocese) who first brought the East-Englishmen to the Christian faith,
and state of perpetual felicity, built in this place, the second Church of
Christians in this Country, for the first he founded at Babingley where he
landed.

Langley.
The Book of the Carmelites in Couentrie, says that Sir Roger Helke, Baron,
The foundation of the Monastery of Langley.
who married Elianor, daughter to the Earl of Oxford; of whom came Robert
Clauering, father to John, father to Robert that married the daughter of the
Lord Alan Zouch, was the first founder of this Monastery.

The Catalogue of Religious houses, (which is very imperfect) says that the
Ancestor of the wife of Sir Francis Bigot Knight, together with her sisters,
were the Founders.

Another tells me, that Sir Roger Kell, Knight, was the first founder, and that
the Patronage thereof, came to the Vffords, and Dacres by marriage; but of this
name there is a Religious house in Lecestershire, another in the County of
Hertford, and so there may be a mistake. A Nunnery it was, valued at one
hundred twenty eight pounds, nineteen shillings, nine pence, half penny. The
persons of remarkable account interred in this Abbey Church, were these.

It should seem by the premises that this Roger Bigot, who was Sewer to King
Henry the first, and Father of the foresaid Hugh: was the first founder of this
religious Edifice, or at least wise of some other in this Town, for Monks of
the order of Cluny. And Stow in his Annalls agrees with my Author Ordericus.

find in the Collections of Francis Thin Lancaster Herald. In the year 1483.
he was created Duke of Norfolk by King Richard the third, in whose aid he was
slain at Bosworth field on Monday the two and twentieth of Aug. 1485. He was
warned by diverse to refrain from the field, insomuch that the night before he
should set forward toward the King, one wrote this rhyme upon his gate: Hollins.
pa. 759.
Jack of Norffolk be not too bold
For Dikon thy Master is boght and sold.
Yet all this, notwithstanding, he regarding more his oath, his honor, and
promise made to King Richard, like a gentleman, and as a faithful subject to
his Prince, absented not himself from his master, but as he faithfully lived
under him, so he manfully died with him, to his great fame and laud. And
therefore though his service was ill employed in aid of a Tyrant (whom it had
been more honorable to have suppressed then supported) yet because he had
upon his fealty undertaken to fight in his quarrel, he thought it less loss
of life and living, then of glory and honor; so that he might have said in
respect of his loyalty, and promised truth testified with constancy to the
death; Est mihi supplicium causa fuisse pium.


This passage is wondrously well delivered to us in verse, by an honorable
late writer, thus.

Sir John Beaumont Baronet deceased, in his Poem of Bosworth field.
Long since the King had thought it time to send
For trusty Norfolk, his undaunted friend,
Who hasting from the place of his abode,
Found at the door a world of papers strow'd;
Some would affright him from the Tyrants aid,
Affirming that his Master was betraide;
Some laid before him all those bloody deeds,
From which a line of sharp revenge proceeds
With much compassion, that so brave a Knight
Should serve a Lord, against whom Angels fight;
And others put suspicions in his mind,
That Richard most observed, was most unkind.
The Duke a while these cautious words reuolues
With serious thoughts, and thus at last resolves.
If all the Camp prove traitors to my Lord,
Shall spotless Norfolk falsify his word;
Mine oath is past, I swore t'vphold his Crown,
And that shall swim, or I with it will drown.
It is too late now to dispute the right,
Dare any tongue since York spread forth his light,
Nort^umberland, or Buckingham defame,
Two valiant Cliffords, Roos, or Beaumonts name,
Because they in the weaker quarrel die?
They had the King with them, and so have I.
But every eye the face of Richard shunnes
For that foul murder of his brothers sons:
Yet laws of Knighthood gave me not a sword
To strike at him; whom all with joint accord
Have made my Prince, to whom I tribute bring*
I hate his vices, but adore the King.
Victorious Edward, if thy soul can hear
Thy servant Howard, I devoutly swear,
That to have saved thy children from that day,
My hopes on earth should willingly decay;
Would Glouster then my perfect faith had tried,
And made two graves, when Noble Hastings died.
This said, his troops he into order brings.
A little after he gives us a touch of the Dukes valor, and deciphers the
manner of his death, in these matchless numbers which follow: Here valiant
Oxford and fierce Norfolk meet,
And with their spears each other rudely greet;
About the air the shiuer'd pieces play,
Then on their swords their Noble hands they lay,
And Norfolk first a blow directly guides
To Oxfords head, which from his helmet slides
Upon his arm, and biting through the steel,
Inflicts a wound, which Vere disdaines to feel,
He lifts his Fauchion with a threatening grace,
And hewes the Beuer off from Howards face*
This being done, he with compassion charmed
Retires, ashamed to strike a man disarmed:
But straight a deadly shaft, sent from a bow,
(Whose master, though far off, the Duke could know)
Untimely brought this combat to an end,
And pierced the brain of Richards constant friend.
When Oxford saw him sink, his noble soul
Was full of grief, which made him thus condole.
Farewell true Knight, to whom no costly grave
Can give due honor: would my tears might save
Those streams of blood, deserving to be spilt
In better service: had not Richards guilt
Such heavy weight upon his fortune laid
Thy glorious virtues had his sins outwaighd.


Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk.
Sir Thomas Howard, Knight of the Garter, Earl of Surrey, and Duke of Norfolk,
son and heir of the foresaid John, thus slain, was here likewise entombed:
who died in the sixteenth year of the reign of King Henry the eight, 1524.

This Thomas was with his father in the forefront of the foresaid Battle,
where he had the leading of the Archers, which King Richard so placed, as a
bulwark to defend the rest. The martial prowess of this Earl in the pight
field, and his resolute brave carriage being taken prisoner, are delineated to
the life by my said Author Sir John Beaumont, the particulars whereof, if they
may seem as pleasing to you in the reading, as they were to me in the writing,
cannot be any way tedious here to set down: for they are sinnewy strong lives,
and will draw you, no doubt, with them along.

Courageous Talbot, had with Surrey met,
And after many blows begins to fret,
That one so young in Arms, should thus vnmoou'd,
Resist his strength, so often in war approou'd.
And now the Earl beholds his fathers fall,
Whose death like horrid darkness frighted all:
Some give themselves as captives, others fly;
But this young Lion casts his generous eye
On Mowbrayes Lion, painted in his shield,
And with that King of beasts, repines to yield
The field (says he) in which the Lion stands,
Is blood, and blood I offer to the hands
Of daring foes; but never shall my flight
Dye black my Lion, which as yet is white.
His enemies (like cunning Huntsmen) strive,
In binding snares to take their prey alive,
While he desires t'expose his naked breast,
And thinks the sword that deepest strikes, is best.
Young Howard single with an Army fights,
When moved with pity, two renowned knights,
Strong Clarindon, and valiant Coniers try,
To rescue him, in which attempt they dye.
Now Surrey fainting, scarce his sword can hold,
Which made a common soldier grow so bold,
To lay rude hands upon that noble flower,
Which he disdaining (anger gives him power)
Erects his weapon with a nimble round,
And sends the Peasants arm to kiss the ground:
This done, to Talbot he presents his blade,
And says, It is not hope of life has made
This my submission, but my strength is spent,
And some perhaps of villain blood will vent
My weary soul: this favor I demand,
That I may dye by your victorious hand.
Nay God forbid, that any of my name
(Quoth Talbot) should put out so bright a flame,
As burns in thee (brave youth) where thou have erred,
It was thy fathers ^ault, since he preferred
A Tyrants Crown, before the iuster side.
The Earl still mindful of his birth, replide.
I Wonder Talbot, that thy noble heart
Insults on ruins of the vanquished part:
We had the right, if now to you it flow,
The fortune of your swords has made it so:
I never will my lucklesse choice repent,
Nor can it stain mine honor or descent,
Set Englands Royal wreath upon a stake,
There will I fight, and not the place forsake.
And if the will of God has so disposed,
That Richmonds brow be with the Crown enclosed,
I shall to him or his, give doubtless signs,
That duty in my thoughts, not faction, shines:
Which he proved to be true in the whole course of his life, which was
depensild upon a Table, and fixed here to his funeral monument; a copy
whereof it was my hap to have out of the original, of which, so much as
concerns the subject I here speak of: in the same Character: FOr as much as
it is wryttyn in the Epitaphe about the Tomb here present, of the high and
mighty Prince, Thomas, late Duke of Norffolk after his descent from his noble
antecessours, declared in the same in writing, which is also set out in arms
about the same Tomb. That who will se farther of the manner of his living and
service done by him to his Pryncis; And of his honorable depertyng out of this
world, schall resort and look in this Table.

First you schall know the seid Duke was in his young age, after he had been a
sufficient season at the gramer schole, Hencheman to King Edward the iiii. and
was than called Thomas Howard, Son and heir to Sir John Howard Knight, after,
Lord Howard, and after that, Duke of Norffolke of right enheritance; and the
seid Thomas Howard when he was at man's age, was with diverse other Gentlemen
of England, sent to Charles, Duke of Burg^n in the beginning of the wars
betwixt King Jews of France, and the seid Duke Charles, and there continued
unto the end of the seid wars, to his great praise and thankys. As well of
King Edward his own souerayn Lord, as of the seid Duke Charles. And after the
wars done betwyxt the seid King Jews, and the seid Duke Charles, Than the
seid Thomas Howard returned in to England, un to King Edward his souerayn
Lord: And he made him immedyatly Esquyer for his body. And he was about him at
his making ready both euenyng and morning. And afterward he made him Knight
at the marriage of the Duke of York, King Edward his second son. And so he
was with the seid King Edward in all his busynes, as well at Lyncolne Shire
feld, and at the time of Banberyfeld, as at all other his busynes And also at
such time as the same King was takyn by the Earl of Warwyke at Warwyke before
his escape and departing in to Flaunders.

And after the Kyngys depertynge in to Flaunders, for that the Coostis of
England were so set ffor depertynge of any other his seruauntis and frendis,
the seid Thomas Howard was dryuyn of fforce to take Sayntwary of Saint Ioannes
in Colchester for the true service he bare un to King Edward; and at the seid
Kyngys return out of Flaunders, the seid Sir Thomas Howard resortyd un to him
and went with him to Barnet Feld, and there was sore hurt.

And after when King Edward went into France with his Army Ryall, he sent
thither before, diverse gentylmen, And for that the seid Sir Thomas Howard had
good experyence as well in his being with Charles Duke of Burgon, as in diverse
Feldys and busynesses witthe seid King Edward, he had therefore Commandment to
go over with them, For his advise and counsel till the said King came over,
And when King Edward and King Jews met at the Barriars upon the River of
Some, the seid Sir Thomas Howard was with king Edward at the Barriars by the
kyngis commandment and no mo Men save only the Chaunceller of England, the
Chaunceller of France, and Sir John Cheney.

And after the kyngis coming home into England, the seid Sir Thomas Howard
obtained license of the king to lie in Norffolk at an howsse which he had in
the right of my Lady his wyffe, called Asshewelthorpe, and there he lay and
kept an honorable howsse, in the favor of the hoole Shire, during the lyffe of
the seid king Edward, and at that time and long after my Lord his father was
alive.

And after king Edward was ded, and king Edward the fyfte his Son; than king
Rychard was king, And than the forseid Sir Thomas Howard was his Subgette, And
for that the young Duches of Norffolk which was very heir thereunto, was ded
without issue; And the Lord Howard, Father to the seid Sir Thomas Howard, was
rightefull heir to the same off former descent, was creatt Duke of Norffolk,
and he creatt Earl of Surrey: And so they both served the seid king Rychard
truly as his Subgettis during his lyff, lyeng at home in their own Countries
and keeping honorable howsses. And they went with him to Bosworthe field, where
the seid king Rychard was slain, and also the seid Duke of Norffolk, And
thafforseid Earl hurt, and takyn upon the Feld, and put in the Tower of
London, by king Henry the vii, and there continued three yeerys and an half. In
which time of his being in the Tower, the same king Henry had a field with
the Earl of Lyncolne in Notyngham Shire besydys Newarke, and the leeffetenant
of the Tower came to the seid Earl, and proferred to him the keys to goo out
at his pleasure; and he answered him again, that he would not deperte thens, un
to such time as he that commanded him thither, should command him out ageyn,
which was king Henry the vii. but charged the leffetenant upon his
alligeaunce if the king war on live to bring him there, as the king was, to
the^tente he might do his Grace service, and after that for the true and
feithfull service that the seid king Henry herd of him done to his other
Prince; and also that he saw himself, he did on Bosworth feld, and for the
great preyse and truth that he herd of him whills he was prisoner, and that he
would not, though he had liberty, come out of the Tower at the Earl of
Lyncolnes feld, he took him out to his presence, and to be about his own
person.

And within x. wekes after his coming out of the Tower, there was an
Insurrection in the North by whom the Earl of Northombrelond was sleyne in the
feld, and also the City of York won^e with a saw^e by force; And for the
subduyng of those Rebels, the king assembled a great host of his subgettis,
and took his journey toward them from the Castle of Hertford; and the seid
Earl of Surrey made chief captayn of his voward, and appointed under him in the
seid voward, the Earl of Shrewesbury, the Lord Hastyngs, Sir William Stanley,
than being the kings Chambrelayn, Sir Rice ap Thomas, Sir Thomas Bowser, Sir
John Savage, Sir John Ryseley, and dyvers other, And when this Journey was done
the Capiteynes of these Rebels, and many other of them were put to execucion,
And for the syngul^r trust that the king had to the seid Earl, and the
activyte that he saw in him, he left him in the North, and made him his
Lyve^enaunt general from Trent Northward, and Warden of the Est and myddle
Marches of England, against Scotlond, and Justice of the Forests from Trent
Northward, and there he continued x years; and kept the country in peace with
policy* and many pains taking without which yt would not have been, for that
the country had been so lately ponyss^ed, and not without desert, And thus he
did the hoole time of x year, savyng in the second year of his being, there was
an Insurrexion in the West part of the country with whom the seid Earl with
the help of the kings true subgetts fought in the feld, and subdued them at
Akworth besides Pomfrett; And besides dyvers of them that were s^ayne in the
feld he took the Capytaynes and put them to execucion* and the residue he sued
to the kings highness for there Pardones which he obtained, and wanne thereby the
favor of the country. And in the same year the king went over the sea, and
laid seege to Bolayn, the seid Earl than remaynyng there, not withstondyng that
he was appointed to have gone with the king, and h^d gone* but for the lightness
of the pepule there, wherefore he was left behynd both for the sauegard of the
country, and for defendyng of the Realm for the synguler trust that he had
unto him.

And sone after there was war with the Scottis, and for that the seid Earl
would be in a redynes to defend them, he went to Annwyke, and there lay to the
defense of the borders: And in his own person made a winter Rood into
Tyvydale, and there brent there howsses, and there corn to the greatest loss and
empouerysshement of the country, that was done there in an hundredth year
before; And after that, the king of Scott's in his own person, and one Par^yn
with him invaded this Realm of England, with a greatre power* and laid seege
to Northam Castle. And as soon as he ^erde that the seid Earl was coming
towardis him he deperted and fled into Scotlond with all the speed he might.
And in the same Somer after, the seid Earl made another Rood in to Scotlond,
and laid seege to the Castle of Heyton, and did race and pull down the seid
Castle, the king of Scottis with the puyssaunce of his Realm lokyng upon it;
and the Earl had not than past viii or ix thousand men with him. And than the
king of Scottis sent unto the seid Earl, Lion his Herrold for to require
battle* which was granted by the seid Earl, saying unto the seid Herrold that
forasmoche as he was an Officer of Arms sent from the king his Master to
require bataile, and he Lyvetenaunt to the king his Master, granted thereunto.
And said it was a contracte and a full bargayn which cowde not be brokyn, but
in the defawte of oon of them. And promised by the faith that he bare to God,
and to Saint George, and to the king his Master, he would fulfill his promise.
And if the king his Master brake, yt should be asmoche to his dishonor and
reproach as ever had Prince. And when the Harrold had herd this answer, and
saw weall the said Earl was clearly determined to fight; he said unto him, Sir
the king my master sends you word, that for eschewyng of effusion of Gristen
blood, he will be contented to fight with you hand to hand for the Town of
Berwike, and the Fisshegarthis on the West marches: if he win you in bataile,
and if ye win him in bataile you to have a kyngis Raunsom. Whereunto the said
Earl made answer, that he thanked his Grace that he would put him to so much
honor, that he being a king anointed would fight hand to hand with so poor a
man as he, how be yt he seid he would not dysceyve his Grace, for he said though
he wanne him in in bataile, he was never the nerer Berwike, ner of
Fisshegarthys, for, he had no such comyssyon so to do: his Comyssyon was to do
the king of Scottis his Master all the harm he could, and so he had don, and
would do, etc. And bad him show unto the king his Master that when the Journey
was don, he would fight with him on Horsback or on foot at his plesur, at any
place he would indifferently appoint, if the king his Master would gyff him leave,
etc.

And when the war was done and ^ended witthe Scottis, and the North part of
England in good rest and peace, than the kings Highness sent for the seid Earl
to be again about his parson, and made him Tresourar of England, and of his
priuye Counsayll.

And after that the king sent him into Scotland as chief Com^myssyoner with
Lady Margarett his daughter, to be married to the foresaid king of Scottis,
which king at the time of the seid Erlys being there, entreteyned him as
thankfully and favorably as could be thought. Notwithstondyng any
dyspleasures done to him by the seid Earl in the wars before. And also the
seid king said than un to him, that he loved him the better for such servyce
as he had done before to the king his father king of England, though the hurt
war done to him, and to his Realm, and he gave to him then at his depertyng
greatt gyfts. And at the coming home again of the seid Earl for the trust that
the king our souerayn Lord had to him, his Grace made him one of his Executours.

And after the death of king Henry the vii, king Henry theyght made him like
wise of his prevay counsayll, and still continued Tresourer of England, and
made him high Marshall of the same: And for the syngler trust that the king
had as well to his truth, as to his wisdom and actyvytte, at his going in to
France with his puyssaunce, havyng with his hyghnes the most part of his
Nobles of this Realm, left the said Earl with a certain power in the North
partys, and made him Lyvetenaunte general from Trent Northward, to defend the
Realm against the king of Scottys, whom his hyghnes had no trust unto for
cause of the leeg betwyxt France and them: in case the s^^d king would invade
this his Realm, which he did in deed, contrary to his oath and promise, with
the hoole power of the Realm of Scotlond: Which when the seid Earl hard of,
he made as greatt haste towardis him as he could with the kings power of the
North partys. And took his lodgyng in the Camp or plain ca^^yd Wollar haugh in
the County of Northumbrelond which was in the ^ight of the king of Scottis,
and of all his army then ^ying on Floddon hill, a ground more like a camp or
forteres, than any meet ground to gyve battle on, contrary to his promise made
to Roge^ras Purseuaunte at armies, before sent unto him from the seid Earl with
message, that the said Earl with the Lord Howard then Admerall of England his
Son, And the no(...) men of the North partis, with other the kings Subgettis of
the same North partis, was come thedir to repress and resist his Invasyons of
his souerayn Lordis Realm; desyryng the said king of Scottis to gyve him
bataile, which his message the same king of Scottis took very thankfully and
ioyusly, promysyng him to abide there on the same ground, where he than was;
which his promys he brake as is aforesaid, and took Floddon hil^ys, a ground
unprengnable, and shot at him his great Ordenaunce, where as he lay like one
minded to keep it like a forteres, And when the said Earl did perceyve that he
had brokyn his promys, and takyn so strong ^ ground as Floddon hillys, he
than the said Earl removed all his Batail unto a plain besydis Barmer wood to
thentente to get between him and his own Realm of Scotlond, and there leygeed
but one night, and on the next morning to^e his passage over the water of at
Twyfull forth, and than he marched the said king and his oste in such manner,
as he gat between him and his aune reame of Scotlond be force whereof the said
king was fayn to leave his Camp, and to prepare himself to bataile witthe seid
Earl, on a hill besydis Bramston in Northumbrelond very near unto Sandyford.
Where the said Earl witthe good assistauns of the Nobull men, and the power of
the said North partys fought witthe said king and him ^anqu^sshed, and slew in
plain bataile derectely before his own Standard. In which bataile ware slain
on the Scottysshe part ii Bysshoppes, xi E^lys, xvii Barons, CCCC knyghtis
besydys other Gentilmen, with xvii M in nombre, which ware nombred asweel by
Scottysshe men as by them that did bury the most part of them. And of troth
dyvers Gentylmen and others as well of the said Erlys servantys, as of the North
parties, and of Chesshir and Lankasshir war there slain, for hard it is and
half impossible in such a conflicte and bataile to be won without loss of
men, whoys death may be ioyed among there frendis to dye in so high a servys done
to there Prince. And this noble act was don by the help of almighty God to the
high honor of the kyngis hyghnes. Honor and prays to the said Earl and to all
other Noble men, and otheres the kings Subgettis that war there with him at the
bataile the ix day of Septembir in the v year of our souerayn Lord king Henry
the viii.

And this done the said Earl went to Barwyke, to establysshe all thyngys well
and in good order: And sent for the deed body of the king of Scottis to
Barwyke, And when the Ordenaunce of the king of Scottis was brouth of the feld,
and put in good suertie and all other thyngys in good order. Than the seid Earl
took his Journey toward York, and there abode during the kyngis pleasur, and
carried with him the deed body of thafforesaid king of Scottis. And there lay
unto such time as the kyngis hygh^es came from beyond the Sea, after his
wynnyng of Tyrwyn and Tomey. And than his highness sent for the seid Earl to
mete him at Rychemond* and so he did, and there delyvered unto his highness the
deed body of the king of Scottis, which de^^ body was delivered in to the
Charter house there, and there to abide during the kings plesur.

And for the servyce that the seid Earl did, he was honorably restored unto
his right name of Duke of Norffolk, and also had given unto him greatt
possessions by the kyngis highness.

And when the war betwixt the king our souerayn Lord and the French King was
eended: than the said Duke was sent into France as chieff Commyssyoner with
Lady Marye the Kyngis Suster, to be married unto the French King Jews.

And after when the king and the Queen were both out of the Reame to mete
witthe French king Frauncys at Guynes, and the Princes remaynyng in the Reame
being a child, the said Duke was left behind as protector and defender to
mynyster Justice, and to see good Rule and Governance in the Reame, in the
absence of the kyngis highness, and so continued about the king, and of his
preuye Counsel till he was of age of fourscore yeeris, and then the kyngis
highness was content that the said Duke should go home, in to his own country
unto the Castle of Framlyngham, where he continued and kept an honorable house
unto the hour of his death. And there he dyed like a good Christian Prince I now
to wytnes. Whose soul Jesus pardon.

And at his depertyng out of Framlyngham Castle toward his buryall he could
not be asked one grote for his debt, nor for restitucion to any person, and so

espoused to the heir of Sir Rice app Thomas of Walys: the Lady Elysabeth
espoused unto the Uicount Fitzwaters son and heyr. And the Lady Dorathie then
being not married, but left for her Right, good substance to marry hyrwyth.



Henry Fitz Roy Duke of Richmond.
Henry Fitz-Roy the natural son of King Henry the eight (begotten of the
Lady Talboys, daughter of Sir John Blount knight) Duke of Richmond was here
interred, as Graston, Stow, Hollinshed, and other writers affirm: howsoever
some will have him to be buried at Framingham in Suffolk. He married Mary
daughter of the foreremembred Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshall,
and Lord high Treasurer of England, with whom he lived not long, but dyed at
Saint James by Westminster the 22. of July, in the year of Christ Jesus, 1536.

He was a Prince very forward in Martial actiuities, of good literature and
knowledge in the tongues; unto whom the learned Antiquarie Leland dedicated a
book; as appears by this Hexastichon following, which is to be found amongst
the said Lelands written Epigrams.

Ad illustrissimum Henricum Ducem Richmontanum.
Quo Romana modo maiuscula littera pingi,
Pingi quo possit littera parua modo,
Hic liber ecce tibi signis monstrabit apertis
Princeps, Aonij sp^s et alumne gregis:
Qui tibi si placeat (quod certe spero futurum)
Maxima proparuo munere dona dabis.
Now for that I have here found such ample relation of the worthy atchieuements
of the Howards, I will go forwards with that illustrious family as I find
them in this tract, either intombed or otherwise remembered in Churches.

Middleton.
Although no Subscription now remains under this portraiture, yet by the
impalement of the Arms of Howard, and Scales on the side thereof, it is
manifest that this was made for Robert Lord Scales, whose daughter and Co-heire
Margaret, was married unto Sir Robert Howard, Knight, eldest son of Sir John
Howard, Knight, who in the one and twentieth of Edward the Third, was made
Admiral ab ore Aquae Thamesis versus parts Boriales quamdiu Regi placuerit.
And this Sir Robert was great Grandfather to John Howard Duke of Norfolk.



East Winch.
On the South side of the Chancell of East-Winch Church, is an ancient
Chapel, called Howards Chapel, in which are these Monuments following.

In the South Wall of the said Chapel, this enarched Monument, as it is here
set forth, diverse of the Escocheons being decayed (which are left blanke) and
only this inscription now remaining thereon...... animabus Domini Roberti
Howard militis et Margerie vxoris sue.....



On the Pauement of the said Chapel, be these two stones as they are here
defigured, whose inscriptions through time are decayed, or rather stolen away
by some sacrilegious persons, a crime (as I have said elsewhere) too frequent,
and too little punished; but without doubt these Monuments were here placed for
some of the Ancestors of this most honorable family, this being their peculiar
Chapel and place of Burial.





In the East Window of the foresaid Chapel, this ancient effigies of late was
perfectly to be seen, (the portraiture of the same being exactly taken by the
learned Gent. Sir Henry Spelman, the memory thereof (as of diverse other
Monuments) an by him preserved) in relation to which, this worthy Knight writ
these verses.

Creditur has sacris candentem ardoribus aedes,
(Quas dicat hic supplex) instituisse Deo.


This ancient Chapel of the Howards, has of late years been most
irreligiously defaced by uncovering the same; taking off the Lead, and
committing it to sale, whereby these ancient Monuments have layne open to
ruin: But now in repairing by the order of the most Honorable preserver of
Antiquities (as well in general, as in his own particular) Thomas Earl of
Arundell and Surrey, Earl Marshall of England, and the Chief of that most
Honorable family.

To this I also offer in observation, both that the Posture, fashion of the
Armor, and coat of Arms (wherewith it is habited) denotes great antiquity:
and it should seem by the Banner-fashiond Shield, that this was the
portraiture of some Banneret, Ancestor of this Illustrious family; for that
Banners, and the manner of this bearing of Arms was only proper to Bannerets,
Knights of the Garter, Barons, and higher nobility.

In this Church of East Winch is a very fair Font of ancient times, erected by
some of this family, as appears by their Arms being disposed in diverse
places of the same; the which for the curiosity of the work, considering the
antiquity, gives me occasion here to present the true form of one part thereof
unto your view.



Weeting.
In the South Window of the Church of Weeting S. Mary's, is this portraiture
following, the which by the Arms does seem to be the picture of Sir John
Howard Knight, made in the time that he was married to Margaret, the daughter
and heir of Sir John Plays.



Farsfield.
In the East Window of the South part of this Church, is the resemblance of one
of the most noble Family of the Howards, as appears by his Coat of Arms;
but the subscription being wanting, obscures the means to discover which of
them he was.



Framlingham.
Howsoever this Town stands in Suffolk, yet (I hope) it comes not in
impertinently in this place. Under a goodly rich Monument in this Parish Church
lie interred the honorable remains of Henry Howard Earl of Surrey, and
knight of the Garter, the son of Thomas Duke of Norfolk, as also of Frances
his wife, the daughter of John Vere Earl of Oxford, as appears by the
Inscription thereupon engraven, as follows.

Henry Howard Earl of Surrey and Frances his wife.
Henrico Howardo Thomae secundi Ducis Norfolciae filio primogenito, Thomae
tertij Patri, Comiti Surriae, et Georgiani ordinis Equiti ^urato, immature anno
salutis, 1546. abrepto. Et Franciscae vxori eius, fil^ae Iohannis Comitis
Oxoniae. Henricus Howardus Comes Northamptoniae filius secundo genitus, hoc
supremum pietatis in Parents monumentum posuit. A.D. 1614.

Camd. in Norf.
This Henry Earl of Surrey, says Camden, was the first of our English
Nobility, that did illustrate his high birth with the beauty of learning, and
his learning with the knowledge of diverse languages, which he attained unto by
his trauells into foreign Nations. Pit. de illust. Ang. scriptoribus page 923.
He was a man, elegantis ingenij politaeque doctrinae, says Pitseus. He writ
diverse works both divine and humane; he was exquisite as well in Latin as in
English verse. Of his English take this Essay, being an Epitaph which he made
to the memory of Sir Anthony Denny Knight, a Gentleman whom King Henry the
eight greatly affected.

Upon the death of Sir Anthony Denny.
Hen. How. Poem.
Death and the King did, as it were, contend
Sir Anthony Denny.
Which of them two bare Denny greatest love:
The King to show his love began far extend:
Did him advance his betters far above:
Nere place, much wealth, great honor eke him gave,
To make it known what power great Princes have.
But when death came with his triumphant gift,
From worldly carke he quit his wearied ghost,
Free from the corpse, and straight to heaven it lift.
Now deem that can who did for Denny most;
The King gave wealth, but fading and unsure,
Death brought him bliss that ever shall endure.
Leland our English Antiquary speaking much in the praise of Sir Thomas Wiat
the elder, as well for his learning as other his excellent qualities meet for
a man of his calling; calls this Nobleman, the conscript enrolled heir of the
said Sir Thomas Wiat, being one delighted in the like Studies with the said Sir
Thomas Wiat. As it is in his Naeniae or Funeral Songs as follows.

Le^and ^n suis N^ij^.
Bella suum merito iactet Florentia Dantem,
Regia Petrarchae carmina Roma probet.
Hi^ non inferior patrio sermon Viattus,
Eloquij secum qui decus omne tulit.
Transtulit in nostram Dauidis carmina linguam,
Et numeros magna reddidit art pares.
Non morietur opus tersum, spectabile, sacrum,
Clarior hac fama part Viattus ^rit.
Vna dies geminos Phaenices non dedit orbi,
Mors erit vnius, vita sed alterius.
Rara auis in terris confectus morte Viattus,
Houerdum baeredem scripserat ante suum.
Dicere nemo potest recte perijsse Viattum,
Ingenij cuius tot monimenta vigent.
In another place to the said Lord Henry Howard thus. Accipe Regnorum Comes
illustrissime carmen,
Quo mea Musa tuum laudavit maesta Viattum.
Again. Perge Houerde tuum virtute refer Viattum,
Dicerisque tuae clarissima gloria stirpis.


This Sir Thomas Wiat, the Translatour of David's Psalms into English, died of
the pestilence in the West country, The death of Sir Tho. Wiat.
being on his journey into Spain, whither he was sent Ambassador from the
King unto the Emperor, in the year 1541.

But to return, this Earl had, together with his learning, wisdom,
fortitude, munificence, and affability; yet all these good and excellent parts
were no protections against the Kings displeasure. For, upon the twelfth of
December, Annal. Stow. Hollin^ Hali. Speed. H^^^.
the last of King Henry the eight, he with his Father Thomas Duke of Norfolk,
upon certain surmises of Treason, were committed to the Tower of London, the
one by water, the other by land, so that the one knew not of the others
apprehension; The fifteenth day of January next following, he was arraigned at
Guild Hall London, where the greatest matter alleged against him, was, for
bearing certain Arms, that were said belonged to the King and Prince; the
bearing whereof he justified. To be short (for so they were with him) he was
found guilty by twelve common Iuriars, had judgment of death, and upon the
nineteenth day of the same month (nine days before the death of the said King
Henry the eight) was beheaded at Tower Hill. He was first interred in the
Chapel of the Tower, and afterward, viz. in the reign of our late drad
Sovereign King James, of famous memory, his remainders of ashes and bones were
removed to this place, by his second son Henry Earl of Northampton: as
appears by the foresaid Inscription.

Many more goodly Tombs and Grauestones (but without Inscriptions) are in this
Church, made for the remembrance of this Heroical Progeny of the Howards and
their Matches (who have here a fair and beautiful Castle, fortified with a
bank, ditch, and walls of great thickness; wherein are thirteen Towers,
inwardly furnished with buildings right commodious and necessary) the
resemblances and figures whereof had been cut and deline^ted, if the hastiness
of the Press would have permitted.

Of this surname of Howard, thus Verstegan writes, in his treatise, Of our
ancient English Titles of Honor, Dignities, and Offices. And of the word
Holdward.

This ancient and honorable name of Office, says he, has received the in^ury
of time, ^.
which has worn it out of use and memory. The l and d, being for easiness of
sound omitted in the pronunciation (as in sundry other words the like is
seen) it became of Holdward which signifies the governor or keeper of a
Castle, fort, or hold of war, to be Howard.

Which name of Office albeit we have long since lost, yet retains our Realm,
to the high honor and illustrious ornament thereof, the great and ^^gh^ noble
family unto whom it is now the surname, and it is like that at first it so
became to be, upon the bearing of such a warlike honorable Office and charge.

Here lies Henry Gray, the Son of Sir Thomas Gray knight of Heton, and Ione his

The Tomb for Thomas her husband is arched, whereupon the pictures of himself
and his wife are graven in brass, himself having fyve sons likewise
engraven in brass, behynd him, and she six daughters.

^
There is another Tomb erected to the memory of Sir Anthony Heveningham knight,
without Inscription.

This Town is now the place of residence of the most ancient Family of the
Heueninghams, which has been very honorably matched, and with whom few
families in England does parallel for a Knightly descent. Of which I have read
this note, out of certain Antiquities collected by Master Howldiche.

^
Ann Dom 1020. in the reign of King Canutus Gualfride de Heueningham, was Lord
of Heueningham in the County of Suffolk, of which house has been 25.
Knights, with Sir Io. Heueningham now living. An. 1610.

^
Their original indeed is from that Town of Heueningham in Suffolk, which is
possessed by them to this day. Where, in a particular Chapel, adjoining unto
the Parish Church, lie three statues cut out of the heart of Oak, of their
Ancestors, of great antiquity, in their full postures. Two of them
representing men, the other a woman, which does appear to have been very
curiously painted and gilt.

West Dereham, or Derham.
Hubert Deane of York afterward Bishop of Salisbury, and from thence
translated to Canterbury) was Founded of a Monastery in this Town, ^
where he was borne, in the reign of King Henry the second, for his own
souls health, and for the souls health of his Father and Mother, and of
Ranulph de Glanvile and Bertha his wife, who brought him up. He bought the land
whereupon this Monastery was built of one Geffrey Fitz. Geffrey of Derham. He
placed therein Regular Canons of the order of Premontre, upon the dedication
thereof to God and the most glorious virgin Mary: but the particulars of the
Foundation will best appear by his Charter thus recorded.

Omnibus sancte Matris Ecclesie filijs presentibus et futuris Hubertus dei

Prudentis est hijs que saluti anime proficiunt dum potest intendere, and

Witnesses to this his Foundation were John Bishop of Norwich, Ranulph de
Glanvile, Lord chief Justice of England, Walter Fitz.-Robert, Geffrey
Fitz-Peter, Richard de Derham, Parson of the Church, Nicholas de Derham and
Elias de Derham, brethren. Which Elias was one of the Executors of the last
Will and Testament of the said Archbishop Hubert, Ann. 7. Iohannis Regis: from
which Nicholas de Derham descended. Tho. Derham of Crimplesham Esquire, Ann. 3.

Here are many old Monuments all without Inscriptions; Kneuet^.
under which diverse of the Family of the Knevets lie buried. Camd. in Nors.
An ancient house and renowned, says Camden, ever since Sir John Kneuet was
Lord Chancellor of England under King Edward the third, and also honorably
allied by great marriages. For, over and besides these of Buckenham, now
Baronets, from hence sprang those right worshipful Knights, Sir Thomas Kneuet,
Lord Kneuet, Sir Henry Kneuet of Wiltshire, and Sir Thomas Kneuet of A^hewell
Thorp and others.

Buckenham old.
Upon a Grauestone in the south side of the Church (over which stone there now
are Pewes built) there is in brass portraied a Crane, from whose heke is a
scrowle with these two words, Deo gratias, and upon a piece of brass
overthwart this inscription.

Here was a religious Foundation of black Canons, dedicated to Saint James,
valued at one hundred, one and thirty pounds, eleven shillings of yearly
commings in.

Erpingham.
Sir John Er^^^^ham, Knight
Under a goodly fair Grauestone lies the body Sir John Erpingham knight, he is
figured upon the stone in complete armor, and the monument is bordered with
this inscription*

Hic iacet Johannes de Erpingham miles quis multa bona fecit tempore vite sue...

At each corner of the marble, a Dove silver crowned, holding a Mase or Scepter
in her pounce.

Sir Thomas Erpingham was knight of the Garter in the reign of Henry the
fourth.

Arms, his Belt bossed and gilt, his Hanger by his side, his Spurs gilt, the
blew Garter about his right leg, his feet resting on a Lion, all engraven in
brass; his wife by his side (on like manner in brass) very sumptuously
garnished with bracelets, Jewels, and her attire according to those times. I
have no inscription to know any further.

Carow.
^^undation of the Nunnery.
A religious house of black Nuns, consecrated to the holiness and honor of
the blessed Virgin Mary, founded by King Stephen, (the founder of many such
sacred Edifices) valued in the Kings books to be yearly worth fourscore and
four pounds, twelve shillings, penny, half penny qua.

Gregory the tenth (as I take it) granted by his Bull this privilege,
inhibition following, to the Nuns of this Priory.

Bromholme.
William Glanuile founded the Church of Saint Andrew, The foundation of S.
Andrews at Bromholme.
at Bromholme in the Diocese of Norwich in the year 1113. says an old
Anonimall Mss. which I have.

In the Pedigree of the right honorable, Edward, Earl of Dorset, I find this
note following.

Beatrix, daughter and coheire of William Sakeuile, Lord of Bracksted, Nayland,
and mount Bures in Essex, and brother to Jordan Sakeuile, married to William de
Glaunuile, Lord of Bromholme, and founder of the Church of Bromholme, anno 17.
Hen. primi, a house it was of Benedictines, valued to be yearly worth an
hundred pounds, five shillings, five pence.

Here was also sometime a Priorie of black Monks Cluniacks dedicated to Saint
Sepulcher, founded by G. Glanuile, and valued at one hundred forty four
pounds, ^.
nineteen shillings, half penny, qua.

Bromholme, sometime a Priory, says Camden, founded and enriched by G.
Glanuill, and seated on the sharp top of an hill, the cross whereof our
ancestors had in holy reverence, I know not for what miracles.

(...)
Thomas Rudhorne, Bishop of S. David's, who flourished in the reign of Henry
the fourth, has (in his history) these words to the same effect.

The holy Cross of Bromholme.
Capulanus quidam portauit quandam crucem ligneam in Angliam, quam affirmauit
esse de ligno in quo pependit Christus et Monachis de Bromholme ob^ulit et
postea locus coruscabat miraculis.

A certain Priest, brought over with him, says he, a wooden Cross into
England, which he affirmed to be the Cross whereupon our Savior Christ was
crucified; which he delivered to the Monks of Bromholme, after which the place
did shine gloriously with miracles.

Capgraue in the life of S. Ed^^^d King and (...).
But the story of this holy Cross is more fully delivered by Capgraue on this
manner. Saint Helene, says he, having found the Cross, did divide it into
nine parts, according to the nine Orders of the Angels: of one part thereof
(which was most besprinckled with Christ's blood, his hands and feet being
thereto nailed) she made a little cross, which she enclosed in a box of gold,
beset with precious stones, and gave it to her son Constantine the Emperor,
which went successively from one Emperor to another, until it came to
Baldwin, who kept a Chaplain to say daily mass before this sacred Relic;
the said Chaplain being dead, one Hugh a Priest, borne here in Norfolk, was
preferred to his place. Baldwin, so long as he carried this Cross with him to
battle, had ever the upper hand of his enemies, but forgetting it, he was
forthwith slain, upon which his Chaplain Hugh stole secretly away with the
said Box and Cross, came to this Monastery of Bromholme, and bestowed them
both here upon the Monks, for which so inestimable a gift, he with his two
sons (which he had by his wife before he entered into holy orders) were kept
of the Monks with all things necessary, until the death of Hugh the father,
and the preferment of both his sons. By the virtue of this holy Cross,
Cooperante Domino, God assisting, thirty and nine persons, were raised from
death to life; and ninteene which were blind, received their sight, besides
many other miracles which it wrought, if you will believe my Author.

(...) compertorum.
Hic apparuit multa superstitio circa crucem quae vocatur, the holy Cross of
Bromholme, et dicunt illic se habere Zonam beat marie et lac eiusdem, et
fragmenta crucis sancti petri et sancte Andree, says a book in the treasury
of the Exchequer of the visitation of Abbeys.

Here appears great superstition about a Cross, which is called the Holy
Cross of Bromholme; and here they say they have the girdle and milk of the
blessed Virgin, and a fragment of the Cross of Saint Peter, and of Saint
Andrew.

I find that the Founder G. Glanuill, was here buried. A name, as you may
read in that which I have already written, of great account for many ages in
diverse parts of this kingdom.

There be of the later writer, says Camden, speaking of the Earls of
Suffolk, who report, Camd. (...)
that the Glanuils in times past, were honored with this title; But seeing
they ground upon no certain authority, where as men may easily mistake, and I
have found nothing of them in the public records of the kingdom, they must
pardon me if I believe them not, until they produce more certainty, yet the
mean while I confess, that the Family of the Glanuils in this tract, was of
right good note, and high reputation.

Walsingham.
One Richold a Widow, The foundation of the Chapel and Priory at Walsingham,
out of a (...) increasing Library of Sir (...)
dwelling in the Town of Walsingsame, was the first founder of the Chapel
there in the year of our Lord God, 1061. which she dedicated to our blessed
Lady, and founded the same in all points, like to the Chapel of our Lady at
Nazareth, in that place where she was saluted by the Angel Gabriel. It was
made a Priory of black Canons, by Edmond Earl of March, and Elisabeth de
Burgo, in the reign of Edward the Third; and valued at the suppression
thereof, (which happened the fourth of August, in the thirtieth year of the
reign of K. Henry the Eight) after the rate of those times, to have of yearly
revenues, four hundred forty six pounds, fourteen shillings, four pence,
half penny, qua.

Camd. in Norf.
This village was much renowned throughout all England for a Pilgrimage to our
Lady, the Virgin Mary: whom he who had not in that former age visited, and
presented with offerings, was reputed irreligious. But this shall Erasmus, an
eye witness, describe in his own very words.

Erasmus of the pilgrimage to W^lsingham.
Not far from the Sea, says he, about four miles, there stands a Town,
living almost of nothing else but upon the resort of Pilgrims. There is a
College of Canons, yet such, as unto whom the Latinists have given the
addition of Regulares; a middle kind, betwixt Monks and those Canons, whom
they term Secular: This College has scarce any other revenues, than from the
liberality of the said Virgin. For, certain of the greater Presents and
Oblations are laid up and preserved. But if there be any money offered, or
ought else, of small value, that goes unto maintenance of the Covent, and
their Head or President, whom they call Prior. The Church is fair and neat:
yet in it the Virgin dwells not: that honor, forsooth, she has done unto
her Son: she has her Church by her self, but so, as that she may be on the
right hand of her Son. Neither does she dwell here for all this, for why, the
building is not yet finished, and the place has a through light and air on
all sides, with open doors, and wide open windows; the Ocean Sea withal the
father and foster of all winds is hard by. In that Church which I said was
unfinished, there is a small Chapel, but all of wood, whereunto on either
side at a narrow and little door, are such admitted, as come with their
devotions and offerings. Small light there is in it, and none other in manner,
but by Tapers or wax Candles, yielding a most deynty and pleasant smell. Nay,
if you look into it, you would say it were the habitation of heavenly Saints
indeed; so bright shining it is all over with precious stones, with gold and
silver.

But within the memory of our fathers, says Camden in the same place, when
King Henry the eight had set his mind and eye both, upon the riches and
possessions of Churches, all this vanished quite away.

Rising Castle.
So denominated of a Castle sometime there standing, (the seat anciently of the
Albineys, the Monthaults, and the Mowbrays) which now after long languishing,
as it were, by reason of old age, has given up the ghost.

In the Porch of this Parish Church, is a Grauestone, under which, say the
inhabitants (which I have heard sworn by others) Isabell, Queen of England,
the wife of Edward the Second, lies interred; upon the Grauestone, are two
words only remaining, which make the country people so think of the matter,
Queen Isabels servant.
which are.... Isabelle Regine.... now by these, the case is made plain, to
any than can distinguish between the Cases Nominative, and Genitive, that this
stone was laid to perpetuate the remembrance of some one of that Queens
servants.

Flytham.
This was a Nunnery, Flytham Priory.
and a Cell to Walsingham, of yearly value, threescore and two pound, ten
shillings, six pence, half penny.

Yngham.
This was a Priory of black Monks Benedictines, The Foundation of the Priory
of Yngham.
a Cell to Saint Albans, founded by the Ancestors of Sir Oliver Yngham knight,
consecrated to the honor of the blessed Virgin Mary, valued at seventy four
pounds, two shillings, seven pence half penny.

Herein lay buried Sir Miles Stapleton, Burials in the Priory Church.
and Ione his wife, the daughter and heir of Sir Oliver Yngham. Sir Miles,
son of the said Miles, and Ela his wife, the daughter of Vfford* Sir Brian
Stapleton, son of the second sir Miles, and his wife, daughter of the Lord
Bardolfe. Sir Miles, son of sir Brian, and Dame Katherin his wife, daughter
of sir Pots, and after married to sir Thomas Sackuile, which are likewise here
buried. Dame Ione Plase, daughter of sir Miles Stapleton. Dame Ela Perpoint,
which had two husbands.... Edmond Stapleton, and his wife, daughter of Clyfton.
Sir Roger Boys, and his wife.

Linne.
Linne, says Leland, sometimes a famous Haven; there, as the Church stands
now, Leland, in his Commentaries.
was anciently without fail, an Abbey, for the graves of many religious
persons as yet appear in the Church; and the lodgings of the Abbey are now
converted into the Archdeacons house. This Monastery I imagine to have been
the house of the Carmelites, founded by the Lord Bardolfe, The foundation of
the Friars Carmelites
Lord Scales, and Sir John Wingenhall, Anno 1269. the dedication nor the value
thereof, I do not find.

The black Friars was founded by Thomas Gedney, The black and white Friars in
Linne.
and the white Friars by Thomas de Feltsham,: and thus much is the little of
them which I have learned.

Here was an Hospital, S. John's Hospital.
dedicated to Saint John, valued at seven pounds, six shillings, and eleven
pence.

Here I have no Inscriptions of antiquity.

Loddon.
This Church was built by James Hobart, knight, one of the privy Council to
King Henry the Seventh, Sir James Hobart knight, the builder of this Church.
who lies here buried, as I have it by relation, of whom, and of the Family,
will it please you read what learned Camden writes. The river Yare, says he,
receives a brook which passes by nothing memorable, but Halles-hall, and
that only memorable for his ancient owner, Sir James Hobart, Attorney
general, and of the pri^ie Council to King Henry the seventh, by him dubbed
knight at such time as he created Henry his son, Prince of Wales) who by
building from the ground, the fair Church at Loddon, being his parish Church,
Saint Olives bridge over Waueney, that divides Norfolk and Suffolk, the
Cawsey thereby, and other works of piety, deserved well of the Church, his
country, and the common weal, and planted three houses of his own issue, out
of the second whereof, Sir Henry Hobart likewise Attorney General to King
James, is lineally descended. The foresaid Sir Henry Hobart, knight and
Baronet, was advanced by the said King, the sixteenth of October, in the
eleventh year of his reign, to be Lord chief Justice of the Common pleas, in
which office he died, the twenty sixth day of December, the first year of the
reign of our gracious Sovereign King Charles, (...). lit. I.
magna Reipub. iactura, a great loss to the weal public, as Sir Henry
Spelman writes.

Margaret, La^^ Hobart.
Here lies Margaret, the wife of Sir James Hobart, who died Anno 1494. as I
have it out of certain funeral Notes.

Yarmouth.
Bishop Herbert, the builder of the Church.
This Town is beautified with a spacious fair Church, having a wondrous high
Spire Steeple, built by Herbert the first Bishop of Norwich, in the reign of
William Rufus. All the funeral Monuments of antiquity in this Church, are
utterly defaced; Inscription nor Epitaph now remaining, except that this may
pass current for one.

Elin^ ^^^^ker.
Elyn Benaker, mercy does crave,
God on her Sowl mercy more have.
In the three and twentieth year of King Edward the Third, happened a most
grievous and lamentable Plague in this Town, which brought (within the
compass of one year) seven thousand, Stow Annal. ex lib. priorat. de Tur.
fifty, and two persons, to their graves: the which is witnessed by an ancient
Latin Chronographicall Table, hanging up in the Church. The Parsonage which was
yearly worth before the sickness, seven hundred Marks, was afterward scarce
worth forty pound by year.

Burials of such as ^^ed of the plague.
The bodies of all the dead were buried in the Church and Churchyard, and in
such and such places of the same, as the Townsmen can show you at this day.

The Priory of Carmelites or white Friars.

Marham.
Here was a religious little house of white Nuns, valued at thirteen pounds,

six shillings, penny half penny. The first Founder hereof was Isabell
Countess of Arundell in her widowhood, the wife of Hugh de Albeney, Earl of

was the Founder: for I find in the Abbey book of Langeley that he lies here
buried. An honorable Family anciently in this tract, and in diverse other
places of the kingdom.

founded a College here at Raueningham; the Kings license and Antonyes Bishop
of Norwich thereunto first obtained, for a Master and eight brethren, Priests.

Cockford.
The foundation of the Priory of Cockford.
Anno 1243. the Priory of black Canons Reguler at Cockford, or Cokesford was
founded by Sir John de Canneto, id est, Cheney knight. After him the Lord Say,
and after that the Lord Clinton were Patrons, as I have it out of a Manuscript.
Which Foundation was rated, as others were, at a low value, to be of yearly
revenues one hundred fifty three pounds, seven shillings and a penny.

So called of a smooth plain or Common thereunto adjoining, some two miles in
extensure: Pinguis adeo and luxurians vt Paduana pascua videatur superasse: So
abundantly fertile, that in fatness of soil it does exceed the pastures about
Padua in Italy. For, it serves, and that sufficiently, for the grazing of all
the greater sort of cattle of seven Towneships, to the same near situated,
besides the feeding of thirty thousand sheep.

In the Churchyard is a ridg'd Altar, Tomb or Sepulcher of a wondrous antique
fashion, upon which an Axell-tree and a cart-wheele are insculped; Under this
Funeral Monument, the Towne-dwellers say that one Hikifricke lies interred; of
whom (as it has gone by tradition from Father to the Son) they thus likewise
report: ^he story of Hikifrick, here (...)
How that upon a time (no man knows how long since) there happened a great
quarrel betwixt the Lord of this land or ground, and the Inhabitants of the
foresaid seven villages, about the meere-markes, limits, or bondaries of this
fruitful feeding place; the matter came to a battle or skirmish, in which the
said Inhabitants being not able to resist the Landlord and his forces, began to
give back; Hikifricke, driving his cart along, and perceiving that his
neighbors were faint-hearted, and ready to take flight, he shook the
Axell-tree from the cart, which he used in stead of a sword, The strange and
(...) of (...)
and took one of the cart-wheeles which he held as a buckler; with these
weapons (in a furious rage, you must imagine) he set upon the Common
adversaries, or adversaries of the Common, encouraged his neighbors to go
forward, and fight valiantly in defense of their liberties; who being animated
by his manly prowess, they took heart to grass, as the proverb is, insomuch
that they chased the Landlord and his company, to the utmost verge of the said
Common; which from that time they have quietly enjoyed to this very day.

The Axell-tree and cart-wheele are cut and figured in diverse places of the
Church, and Church windows, which makes the story, you must needs say, more
probable.

^.
This relation does in many parts parallel with that of one Hay, a strong brave
spirited Scottish Plowman, who upon a set battle of Scots against the Danes,
being working at the same time in the next field, and seeing some of his
countrymen to fly from that hot encounter, caught up an ox yoke, ( Boethius
says, a Plough-beame) with which (after some exhortation that they should not
be faint-hearted) he beat the said straglers back again to the maine Army,
where he with his two sons (who took likewise such weapons as came next to
their hands) renewed the charge so furiously that they quite discomfited the
enemy, obtaining the glory of the day and victory, for their drad Lord and
Sovereign Kenneth the third, King of Scotland: and this happened in the year
942. the second of the said kings reign.

This you may read at large in the History of Scotland, thus abridged by
Camden as follows.

Where Tay now grown bigger enlarges himself (says he) there appears over
it Arrol, Cam^. in Perth Hay^s. Earls of Arrol or E^tol.
the habitation of the noble Earls of Arrol, who ever since the Bruises days,
have been by inheritance the Constables of Scotland: and verily they deduce an
ancient pedigree from one Hay, a man of exceeding strength and excellent
courage: who together with his two sons, in a dangerous battle of Scots
against the Danes at Longcarty, caught up an ox yoke, and so valiantly and
fortunately withal, what with frighting, and what with exhorting, reenforced
the Scots at the point to shrink and recule, that they had the day of the
Danes, and the King with the States of the kingdom ascribed the victory and
their own safety unto his valor and prowess. Whereupon in this place, the
most battle and fruitful grounds were assigned unto him and his heirs, who in
testimony hereof, have set over their coat a yoke for their Creast.

Of which memorable exploite, to the further honor of this ancient and
Princely great Family, John Ionston of Aberdon, that ingenious learned Divine
and Poet has written, as follows.

Haius Pater cum duobus filijs. Io. Ionston. Heroes Sco^.

The Succession, names and number of the right reverend Fathers in God, Lords
and Bishops of Dunwich, Elmham, and Norwich, and of such of them as I find to
have been reputed Saints.

OF the Bishops of Dunwich and Elmham, I have already written; of which number,
Felix the first Bishop was the first Saint.

In the year vi. hundredth thyrty and two
^.
King Edwyne, by holy doctrine,
Of Saint Felix, an holy Priest that was tho,
And preaching of the holy archbishop Paulyn,
Of Christ's word, and verteous discyplyne
Converted Edordwolde, of Estangle the king,
And all the realm, where Felix was dwelling.
^a^gra^e in vi^ (...) confessoria.
This sacred Bishop Felix was borne, brought up, and sublimated with an
Episcopal Mitre, in the parts of Burgundy; which worldly pomp and honor,
together with his own Country, he forsook, only to propagate the Gospel,
and came into England to preach the word of God, in the days of Honorius
Bishop of Rome, Honorius being as then Archbishop of Canterbury. He was a man
every way learned, and what he daily taught, he carefully put in practice by
his holy conversation, and charitable good works. He delivered the word with
great mildness and pleasant elocution, whereby the more easily he subiugated
his Auditors to the yoke of jesus Christ. Having governed the East Angles 17
years, he died at Dunwich, his Seat, S. (...). his (...) places.
the eight of the Ides of March, Anno 647. where in the Church of his own
Foundation, he was first buried; but after a time, his bones were taken up and
conuaied to Some in Cambridgeshire, and there solemnly encoffined in the
Chancell of the Church there, which he likewise built. And afterward, in the
reign of King Canute, his sacred relics were removed from thence to the
Abbey-Church of Ramsey in Huntingdonshire, by the procurement of Ethelstan, at
that time Abbot of the said Monastery.

The next Bishop that I find, was Humbyrct, or Humbert, who kept his See at
Elmham, ^.
and being reputed holy, was reckoned for a Saint, of which a late writer.

^.
The Sea at Norwich, now established (long not stird)
At Eltham planted first, to Norwich then transferd,
Into our bed-roule here, her Humbert in does bring,
(A Counselor that was to that most martyred king
Saint Edmund) who in their rude massacre then slain,
The title of a Saint, his Martyrdom does gain.
Now to come to Norwich, the first Bishop of Norwich was William Herbert: the
second, Euerard: the third, William Turbus: the fourth, John of Oxford: the
fifth, John de Gray: of these I have written before.

The sixth, was Pandulfus, the Popes Legate, he was consecrated at Rome, by
Honorius the Third, Bishop of Rome, and died the fifth year of his
consecration, 1227.

The seventh was Thomas de Blundeuill, an officer of the Exchequer, preferred
thereunto by Hubert de Burgo, the famous chief Justice of England: he died,
August 16. 1236.

The eight, Radulph, who died, An. 1236.

The ninth was William de Raleigh, who was removed to Winchester.

The tenth was Walter de Sufield; the eleventh, Simon de Wanton; the twelfth,
Roger de Sherwyng; the thirteenth, William Middleton, of whom before.

The fourteenth was Raph de Walpoole, translated to Ely. The fifteenth was John
Salmon; the sixteenth was William Ayermin, of whom before.

The seventeenth was Antony de Beck, Doctor of Divinity, a retainer to the
Court of Rome, Godwin de presul. Aug.
and made Bishop by the Popes Prouisorie Bull. He had much to do with the
Monks of his Church, whom it seems he used too rigorously. He also
withstood Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, in his visitation,
appealing from him to Rome. This boisterous unquiet humor, it seems, was his
death; for it is said, that he was poisoned by his own servants.

The eighteenth Bishop was William Bateman, who died at Auinion, in the year
1354. and was there buried, of whom hereafter.

The ninteenth was Thomas Piercy: The twentieth was Henry Spencer: The one and
twentieth was Alexander, of whom before.

The two and twentieth was Richard Courtney, Chancellor of the University of
Oxford, a man famous for his excellent knowledge in both laws. A man of great
lineage, great learning, and great virtue, and no less beloved among the common
people. He died of a Flux in Normandy, at the siege of Harflew, September. 14.
1415. in the second year after his consecration. His body being brought into
England, was honorably interred at Westminster.

The three and twentieth, was John Wakering, of whom I have spoken before.

The four and twentieth was William Alnwick, translated to Lincoln, of whom
hereafter in his place of burial.

The five and twentieth was Thomas Brown, Bishop of Rochester, who being at
the Council of Basil, had this Bishopric cast upon him, before ever he
understood of any such intent toward him. In his time, the Citizens of Norwich
(upon an old grudge) attempted many things against the Church: but such was the
singular wisdom and courage of this Bishop, that all their enterprises came
to none effect; he sat nine years, and died anno 1445. where buried, I do
not find.

The six and twentieth was Gualter Heart, or Lyghart. The seven and twentieth
was James Goldwell. The eight and twentieth was Thomas Ian. The nine and
twentieth was Richard Nyx, of whom before.

The thirtieth, was William Rugge, alias Reps, a Doctor of Divinity in
Cambridge. He sat 14 years, and deceased anno 1550.

The one and thirtieth was Thyrlhey, a Doctor of Law of Cambridge, the first
and last Bishop of Westminster, translated to Ely.

The two and thirtieth was John Hopton, a Doctor of Divinity of Oxford, and
household Chaplain to Queen Mary, elected to this Bishopric in King Edwards
days. He sat 4 years, and died in the same year that Queen Mary did, for
grief as it was supposed.

The three and thirtieth, was John Parkhurst, who lies buried in his
Cathedral Church, under a fair Tomb, with this Inscription.

Johannes Parkhurstus Theol. professor, Gilford: natus, Oxon. educatus.
Temporibus Mariae Reginae pro tuenda conscientia vixit exul voluntarius: postea

Vivo bono, docto, ac pio Iohanni Parkhursto Episcopo vigilentissimo, Georgius
Gardmer posuit hoc monumentum.

The four and thirtieth was Edmund Freake, Doctor of Divinity, who was removed
from hence to Worcester.

The five and thirtieth was Edmund Scambler, household Chaplain for a time to
the Archbishop of Canterbury: he was consecrated Bishop of Peterborough,
January 16. anno 1560. and upon the translation of Bishop Freake, preferred to
this See, where he lies buried under a fair monument, having this
Inscription or Epitaph.

Edmundi Scambleri, viri reuerendissimi, et in ampliss. dignitatis gradu dum
inter homines ageret locati corpus in hoc tegitur tumulo, obijt Non. Maij anno
1594.

Viuo tibi, moriorque tibi, tibi Christ resurgam,
Te quia iustifica Christ prebendo fide.
Huic abeat mortis terror, tibi viuo redemptor,
Mors mihi lucrum est, tu pie Christ salus.
The six and thirtieth was William Redman, Archdeacon of Canterbury,
consecrated January 12. an. 1594. He was sometime fellow of Trinity College in
Cambridge, and bestowed 100. marks upon wainscotting of the Library there. He
died a few days before Michaelmas, Anno 1602.

The seven and thirtieth, was John Iegon, Doctor of Divinity, and Deane of
Norwich, fellow sometimes of Queens College in Cambridge, and afterward
master of Bennet College: of the time of his death, or how long he enjoyed
this high dignity, I have not learned.

The eight and thirtieth was John Ouerall Doctor of Divinity, sometimes Fellow
of Trinity College, Master of Katherine Hall, and the Kings Professor in
Cambridge; afterward, Deane of S. Paul's, a learned great Schooleman, as any
was in all the kingdom: how long he sat, or when he died, I do not
certainly know.

Samuel Harsenet, Doctor of Divinity, sometime Master of Penbroke Hall in
Cambridge, Bishop of Chichester, and now graced with the metropoliticall
dignity of the Archbishopric of York, was the nine and thirtieth Bishop of
this Diocese. Which at this time is governed by the right reverend Father in
God;

Francis White, Doctor of Divinity, the Kings Almone^, sometimes Deane, as
also Bishop of Carlisle, an excellent learned man, as his works now extant do
testify.

Now it here follows that I should say somewhat of the situation, circuit,
commodities, and other particulars of this Diocese, like as I have done of
London, but that is already most exactly performed, and to the full, by that
learned and judicious Knight, and great Antiquary, Sir Henry Spelman, in his
book (before mentioned) called Icenia: a Manuscript much desired to come to
the open view of the world.

Here ends the Ancient Funeral Monuments within the Diocese of Norwich; and
this Book.
FINIS.
