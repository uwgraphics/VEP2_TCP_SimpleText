AN EXPOSITION Upon the thirty two Psalm, describing the true manner of
humbling and raising up of Gods children.
A Psalm of David to give instruction.
THE Psalm has this title common unto it, with diverse others; setting down
first the author, and then the end. The author was David, which is called in
the Scriptures, The sweet singer of Israel: who although he was a King, yet
abused not his prosperity, to spend his time in dalliance, and in the works
of pride; as many do when God has advanced them; but bestowed those hours
which might be spared from his politic ^onsultations, in writing Psalms, for
the exercise of his faith, and the edifying of the Church, wherein it is to be
feared, that his example shall give sentence against many wanton nobles of this
world, who abuse and disgrace the worthy faculty of Poetry, with unclean
Sonnettes, to satisfy their louse minds with a kind of contemplative
fornication, abandoning their good wits, (which God has given them) by
writing of Pamphlettes, in the honor of Venus and Cupid, which one day will be
coumpted no better then so many sacrifices to the Devil. We are taught therefore,
if we have any vein of versificating, or any other good use of our vein, how
to use it, that by this example, our writings may savor of godliness to
stir up the minds of others, as well as our selves thereunto, not to leave
unchaste ditties behind us (as it were bawdes in the world) as many have done.

The end of the Psalm is, to give instruction; that is to say, to teach others
by his own example, in a particular thing, whereof he makes me^^tion. Now
this instruction, as appears in the discourse of the Psalm, proceeded not
from judgment gotten by much reading and observation of others, but by inward
experience and observations of GOD his dealing with himself, which in the end
of his labors and agonies, he recompteth and commits to writing; which
appears by many other Psalms to have been his usual manner. So this
instruction has that singular commendation, that it was delivered out of the
feeling of David's heart, that our spirits might be instructed by his: as one
face answers to another in water; which kind of teaching, if not only, yet
for the most part and principally is availeable, either to humble when a man
speaks not of spiritual things, as of the inhabitable ones (if any such be)
but as of things which he himself felt and tasted before. And this is that
holy experience, which taught the high Priests of the Jews compassion, and
made his offerings for his brethren more zealous; because he felt himself also
pertaker of their infirmities, as the Epistle to the Hebrews witnesses: but
now a days, it may be counted amongst the causes, why the ministry of many
succeeds not better, because they fail in this point; in using so little
conscience in teaching the people, and being without all affections: But those
that are Rhetorical and prompted by the mother-witte, not by any expert soul,
whereby it comes to pass, that a godly man, of no mouth or lips, as
Moses calls himself, that is nothing furnished with eloquence and
utterance, shall build more sound work in Gods Church in one sermon, then
those profane Orators in twenty; though they have never so great a facility
in utterance, and sweet louse of their words, as many senseles men have. We
are therefore to make some profit of this, if we will be wise admonishers of
others; that we labor first our selves to be spiritual men, that we may
discern al things, that we may observe how God has wrought for us in the like
cases before; that both we may leave behind us a sting in the consciences of
others, and be safe guydes in such a labyrinth, as a troubled mind is often to
be led through. The master of a ship which is ignorant of the Seas, what
skill soever he have in Astronomy (which thing yet is necessary for
Navigations) whilst he gazeth upon the stars, or any other artificial
direction, wracketh his ship upon some rock, lurking under the waves, which
would not be, if experience had made him heedfull by sailing that way before.
And indeed, this intolerable defect never shows it self more shamefullie,
or with greater hurt, then when men have need of spiritual comfort, at the
hour of death; or in time of great affliction: for at such times those foolish
sheep-heardes, when they want skill to help their poor sheep out of the ditch,
are driven to play the miserable comforters, and to take some other indirect
course (as many use to do in such case) to cut the sheeps throat in time, to
make him man's meat, least it should be said he died in a ditch: And these are
the miserable and desperate calamities of the people provided for, when they
need most of all spiritual instruction. And here we may espy the cause why
many admonishers and instructers of others, become so ridiculous, as to be
made the jesting-stocks of sinners; because they admonish not, nor instruct not
of feeling, weakening the power of their instructiones; if not by hypocrisy,
yet by flatnes and dulnes of Spirit, that it cannot be received with that
reverence, that admonitions and rebukes wrought in the Primitive co^gregations
of the Church, when men being touched home, fell upon their faces, worshipped
God; affirming that God of a truth was in those ministers. I might be ashamed
in a divine exercise, to make mention of a Paganes counsel, especially in so
spiritual a point as this: save that we are not ashamed to let the Heathen get
ground in that wherein our Idiottes ought to excel their Philosophers; if
thou will reprove (say they) considder first, if the same fault be not in thy
self, or at least some other, as ill or worse, that the reformation thereof
may be a foundation whereon to build thy brothers amendment. And indeed,
although it is untrue to affirm, that a man may not reprehend the fault which
he has in himself; yet where men are carried headlong into an outrage
against other men's sin, without detestation or feeling any remorse for their
own; It is very sure, that in such a man dwells that spirit of hypocrisy,
which is the fowlest fury of hell. Let us have therefore in our reprehensions,
whether publik or private, to our friends or to enemies, the spirit of
compassion and invocation; that our words may have grace with the hearers: For
if before every reprehension (if it were possible) and before every
instruction, we did lift up our minds in some brief meditation, commending the
infirmities of our selves, and that present offendour, both at once to God, and
then proceed to a loving censure, as occasion requires, our sincerity, our
gravity; our charity would so adorn the rebuke, that the offender would
rather be ravished with the admiration of Gods grace in us, then either scoff
it or grow into a choler, as many do. But for-asmuch as to men of a quiet
nature, which hate the reproach of a busy body, the deutie of instruction and
admonishing of others, seems an harder imposition then they are willing to
bear, because there is not one amongst a thousand, that will take it in good
part. It remains therefore, that to that purpose we gather this third
instruction from this title: namely, that men must make Gods proceedings with
their own consciences, profitable for the edifying of others, giving them
instructions thereunto, as here we see David does: For it is the nature of
faith to open men's mouths, and to labor to make many pertakers of their
conversion. That love which follows true repentance, is neither bashful nor
fearful, nor envious, nor partial: for when a man has once got a good
conscience, all the rest of his life after he spends in the instruction of
others. Peter being converted, must strengthen his brethren; David being
forgiven, must turn sinners to God. I will say more, Nabuchadnetzar being
restored, published the service of God to the Heathen: Nay, I will yet say
more, the woman of Samaria; being but a woman, yet being reproved of her
adulteries, and instructed by christ; I will not say preached, but says to her
neighbors, Come, see a man that told me all that ever I did. And if her
instruction be Chronicled in the Gospel to her commendation, surely the double
silence and uncharitable quietness of those that will not meddle with other
men's matters, to instruct them when occasion is offered in matters of so
great weight, must bear a note of their confusion, and be marked with the
black coal of cruelty, and of soule-murther, for what is it else when we say,
let them answer for themselves, we will not put our fingers in the fire for
them: as if Cain had not murdered his brother Abell, because he said, What? am
I my brothers keeper? If we love God, the same spirit is in us, which was in
David, Mine eyes (says he) gusheth out with tears, because men keep not thy
commandments; If we love men, the thread of our affection must be measured by
our care to instruct them, and we will save some by plucking them out of the
fire with fear; and if we love neither God nor men, so that neither the
dishonor of the head, nor the hurt of the member will touch us; it is because
we our selfs are members of another body, and not of Christ which is the head
of his Church.

PSALM 32. 1 Blessed is he which is lifted up from his falling away, and whose
sin is covered.

2 Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity, and in whose
spirit there is no guile.


HItherto of the title; Now follows the PSALM it self, whose principal
question is, that there is no quietness of conscience, nor forgiveness of
sins; where there is no sincere confession of the same: which DAVID proves
by his own example, informing us thereby; that as he, so long as he held his
peace, and concealed his sin, could not be rid of the horrible sense of
Gods wrath: No more can any of us; how-so-euer otherwise we travail in
conversion as he did: If we be sowred with the leaven of like hypocrisy. And
to the end that we should not be secure in the ratifying of a good
conscience, or make light of the spyses of despair which are in us, when we
have no atonement with God by the feeling of forgiveness; he sets down the
contrary effects of a conscience enlarged by Gods grace, and cheared up with
the remission of sins, and of the heart, fraughted with despair, and
tormented with the terror of condemnation, because it feels not the spirit
of adoption. The first is set down in these words; Blessed is that man which
is lifted up from his falling away: Here the Prophet says, that when God
lifts up his children from their sins, and assures their consciences of
his love, he makes them blessed: whereout we learn, that this indeed is that
soueraign good, and high felicity, yea the highest and only happiness which can
be enjoyed in this life, to be discharged of an evil conscience, tormented
with the guilt of wickedness, and fearing vengeance for the same. By this
effect he encourages al of us, as it were with a price to run cheerfully,
and labor seriously for a good conscience. There is no doubt, but that
ungodly men do many times hold in admiration, the security and free
estate, of godly and virtuous men, when they see them stand immovable as
mount Sion, when heaven and earth are mingled together: because they
themselves have many secret stings, and are often stabbed at the heart, who in
worldly respects have less cause to fear then the sheep of Christ's flock.
Those therefore which rejoice not thus in the heart, howsoever they rejoice in
the face, must attend unto this ministry of grace: For to what purpose does the
Lord open men's eyes to see the sweet and blessed estate of such as have humbled
themselves to walk with God, their confidence standing before God, their rich
hope, their quietness and hartes-ease, their joy, as if they had one foot in
heaven already: I say, to what purpose does God lift them up, and let them see
the riches of a good conscience, but to set their teeth an edge at it, and to
ravish them with a desire of the like; so then we see, that the Lord makes an
offer of his grace unto us, and entiseth us by these examples; that
henceforwarde if we profit not thereby, our condemnation might be imputed to
our selves. Let us therefore account this a meruellous happiness, to feel such
a conversion in our souls, that in steed of our former misery, we shall
perceive our selves translated from bondage to liberty, from death to life;
yea, from hell to heaven: for he that has a good conscience, has overcome the
world by his faith. If Princes love him, it shall not puff him up more then a
penny given to him, which is worth a thousand pound; if they hate him and
persecute him, it shall not terrify him, nor endanger him, no more then the
great rebels of Babell, endangered the heaven with their tower: For his soul
is mounted up above al these things, and dispiseth them from an high. As for
the undermining of Satan, who bids him spiritual^ combattes; they exercise
him but they vex him not; they make him active, but they destroy him not; his
force is like the face of a Lion, and what-so-euer objecteth it self, he
bears it down before him; as we see a notable example (as ^t were) of a
spiritual challenge of all the creatures of God, by S. Paul to the Romans 8 Where
he casts down his gauntlet, and bids a defiance to devils, to men, to
^^ight, to depth; to things present and things to come. And when we consider
these things; how truly may we say, that the children of God, spiritually
considered, are so many Kings and Emperors, Queens and Empresses, enriched
with such vnspeak^ble blessings, that if all the hearts of the world were one
heart, it could not con^eine them. And as for them which co^^inue in sin, harden
their hearts, and by clo^ing of wickedness, do twist a roape for their own
necks; how miserable is their estate, when they behold this happiness ^n others,
whereto they cannot atteyne, ^o pine away and perish in the beholding of other
menes salvation. And thus much of the effect which the feeling of remissione of
sins works. That which follows of lifting up from sins, and not
imputing them, and covering them, commends unto us the grace of God, in
bestowing this pardon, and sealing the assurance of the same in our hearts, as
the cause of the foresaid effect, described figuratiuelie by the metaphors of
lifting, imputation and covering: Al which, have their special weight and
importance in this sentence. Lifting up from defection, argues plainly a
contrariety in the estat^ of man before, considering him lyein^ a long in the
contagious filth of his ow^ sin; so weakened, and soaked clean ou^ of heart,
with the execrable leprosy o^ ungodliness, that he is neither able t^ stir
hand or foot, till God lift him v^ from his apostasy. The word imputat^on is
borrowed from accomptes, in^^nuating, that we are run so far in a^rerages
with God, that we can have (...) security of consciences, till we have gotten
such a release, as may deliver us from all fear of imputation of our ^ebtes,
least payment should be requi^ed of us to the vtter-most farthing: as it ^s in
the Gospel. Finally, the translation ^f covering or hiding of sin, is taken
from a general custom of dispatching those things out of the way, whereof a
man cannot sustain the sight, without greevance o^ molestation; thereby
declaring, that sin is such an eyesore to God, that he cannot behold it, and
spare ^t but at once; but that the devil will pre^ent it to God, and provoke him
to pu^ish it, except it be hid and buried in the ^ottome of the Sea: and except
the of^ender be covered with the righteousness of Christ. So that in sum,
these words do set down the feebleness, ^he poverty and nakedness of sin,
which does so discomfort him, if his conscience be awake; that till he have
found remedy for each of them, he thinks himself not out of the compass,
where fire and brimstone shall fall, nor can be delivered from a fearful
expectation of Gods curse.

And on the contrary part; when he feels himself comforted by God^ right
hand, and lifted up out of the quag-mire of contagious pollutions, hi^ soul
begins to taste how sweet the Lord is: and when he feels the specialitie
of his debtes, which was graven in his conscience, cancelled, and so riuete^ to
CHRIST'S cross, that they shall never be imputed; he drinks a more hearty
draught of the waters of life: but most o^ all, when he is assured that his
wickedness is so hid, that it cannot press to Gods throne for vengeance;
nor rise up in judgment against him, in the day of his visitation; he is
then indeed, and perfectly blessed, and wants nothing that can be added in
this life, to the absoluing of most perfit^ felicity.

This forcible propounding therefore of this cause of blessedness, has in i^
an exclusive nature: secretly affirming, that there is no other cause of
justifying, and so of true blessedness: But this grace only, to the end that
men might be stirred up to take this course, whereof the Holy Ghost is the
guide. All men agree in this, that they would feign be blessed: But there is
no consent amongst men, neither in the causes, nor in the thing it self. The
Philosophers, for want of judgment, every one shot his Bolt diversely, and
every one wide of the mark, as appears in the collection, which CICERO has
made of their opinions in his Tusculane questions. The carnal christan has a
true contemplation and judgment, what is that Summum bonum, that is, chief
happiness, but by the halting of an evil conscience, he is turned out of the
way; so, although he say, it is in Heaven, yet he seeks it in Hell; though
he ascribe it to the Spirit, yet he labors for it in the flesh, (it is
fearful that I will speak) though he acknowledge that it is the gift of God;
yet he runs after the devil to obtain it; which is then committed, when
men think themselves happy and blessed, if they can get riches, beauty,
authority, strength, life, and such others; which are common to the
Reprobates. What can be so ridiculous, as to hear the continual declamations
of worldly men against these vanities? And on the contrary part; to behold the
homage and frailty; yea the slavery in which they abandoned to serve such
vile things. If David be well considered, it will not be easy to find out
many Peers to him in worldly respects: His strength is commended by the
conquest of a Lion, his courage in quailing of Goliath; his beauty is set
forth with the praise of a sanguine complexion, and amiable countenance: the
passing ripeness of his wit is manifest in all his story; and touching his
advancement; God took his shep-hooke from him, and delivered a Scepter; and
after his banishment, set him in the throne of his master, which he possessed
not by ^surpation; but (as it were) by a general election, that the heavens
wrought with the applause of the people: His subjects were the only men of the
world; for the rare parts wherewith they were for ^he most quallified; his
Land flowing with milk and honey; the temperature of the air, incomparable
withal other benefits, belonging either to health, profit, or delectation:
with so large a hand, as if God had devised to pleasure him; and nature had
meant to empty ^ll her riches into his bosom, and to continue the same by
the plentiful hope of his posterity. Right truly might I ^aye, that this was
a perfect picture of worldly felicity; and yet we see, that DAVID leaves all
this, and seeks an^^her cause of blessedness: for the finding whereof, these
things before did not help at all; teaching us, that the same ^are ought to
possess our hearts, least they be fore-stalled with a fond assiance, of
finding honey in a hiue, where ther^ is nothing but waspes, and of imagining
our selves to have attained to blessedness; when indeed we are as unhappy a^
infelicity: because we lie along not lif^ted up from our sins, which one day
sha^^ be imputed to us; nor having our wickedness covered, that it should not
infec^ the air, nor offend Gods senses, as ^ dead carcass above the ground.

Hitherto has bin spoken of the caus^ of blessedness, which is the free grace
o^ God, in remitting our sins; the circumstances whereof have also been touched
The last member of this verse, which remains, In whose spirit there is no
guyle; se^teth down a necessary effect of the same teaching an infallible rule
to discern^^ betuixt a presumptuous and false opinion of remission, and a
certain persuasio^ of the same: that is, if there be no guy^^ in the spirit;
whereby it is vnderstoo^ such a sanctification following forgiveness, and joined
to true repentance; tha^ there remains no more covert dealin^ to cloak our
sins in whole or in part, for ^eare of worldly shame, or to seek star^ing
holes to run from God: but that ^he mind well persuaded of Gods love, ^ndued
with an honorable opinion of ^he Church; thinks it no discredit at ^^l, to
make known to the uttermost, all their infirmities and offenses to God in
^ecret, and to the church publikly; so far as the rule of edificatio^, and Gods
discipline ^equire; as we see two notable exam^les in this Prophet, and his
Son; whereof the one has left to the churh, the 51 Psalm. The other, the book
called Ecclesi^^^es; as publik monuments and remem^rances of their falls, and
liberal confession of the same; to remain as it were on ^he file, even to all
posterities; showing ^herby their zealiousnes in repentance, and their
sincerity, in that they were not ^ender over their credites, in respect of ^he
edificatio^ of the church. This then is the effect of that grace which
forgiueth ^ndeed; never to separate the gift of forgiveness, from the gift of
sanctification and the special points thereof, which here is enforced; is
through guyle of Spirit; to keep back nothing vn-confessed, which the nature
of true repentance would discover: But this is not al, for general
sanctification is here showed to be the foot-step of the holy Ghost, by the
printe, whereof, we may know whether we have our portion in this grace of
remission of sins, or whether the fearful signs of the wrath of God abide
upon us still or no. Saint PAV^^ in the eight to the Romans, sets down the
same doctrine, saying; Tha^ calling justification, and sanctification, are so
inseparable, that who-so-euer has the one, has the other also. And to
TIMOTHY (he says) If any man call on the name of the Lord, let him depart
from iniquity: Wherefore, it is the perfection o^ madness, for a man that
remains dissolute, to dream of forgiveness, and when an hypocrite is pure
in his own^ conceit, and yet is not washed from hi^ sins. It is to true,
that in those that are regenerate, and are indeed forgiven, there shall remain
such a waste and unsavory taste, as shall much annoy them, and hu^t the
relish or gift, even of their most sanctified actions: so that the Lord had
need to look with a merciful and for bearing eye, upon the highest virtues
of his children; yea, they shall not be freed from the foul sin of
hypocrisy; but shall feel with much vexation, themselves to be pestered with
such things: how-be-it, in substance and in the chiefest drift of their life,
they are true-harted to God; slipping into these former faults by infirmity,
or by reason of scanter measure of mortification, then they ought to have
labored unto: so that the ods, is in the thing which is propounded to a man's
desire; for if his chiefest care in the love and fear of God, be to seek his
salvation; what-soeuer his hypocrisy be, it is not his guilt of spirit: But if
he propound to himself some other thing, that his heart does rather labor for,
then for salvation; it is certain that he is false-hearted to GOD, and that
such an hypocrisy is ane authentic record, of a man that abides in his
sins: and such a man as this, has neither faith to overcome the world, nor
grace to resist temptation, and though he say, that he is persuaded of
remission, and extol the mercy of GOD above the skies; yet that guile that
remains in his spirit, tormenteth his conscience every day, conuincing him
by this, that because he is not sanctified, therefore he is not pardoned. For
in this work, there is neither water only, nor blood only, but both water
and blood, as Saint JOHN witnesses. It stands us therefore in hand, not to
satisfy our selves with a devotion momentanie; but let our minds stand bent
in holy wo^kes, not to brag of the death of CHRIST, that it has purged our
old sins: But to feel how mighty it is to subdue the new, that the
sinews of ungodliness in our hearts, and unrighteousness and vnsober
behavior in the out-warde man, may be cut off; For it is the confirmation
of our election, if this sincerity be in us: Neither does the sin more
certainly discern the day from the night, then this Spirit does discern
him, which is accepted with GOD, from a wretch; whom he reproves; as Saint
PAVLL plainly says: If any man has not the Spirit of Christ, the same is
not of Christ.

3 When I held my tongue, my bones consumed whilst I waited all the day long.

4 For thine hand is heavy upon me day and night, and my moisture is turned
into the drought of summer, Selah.


Hitherto the prophet has declared that there is no true felicity where there
is no sanctified feeling of remission. Now it remains, that he prove the
same which he does by his own example, declaring the great anguish and
torment which he felt in his conscience, even to the wasting and soaking out of
the strength of his body so long as God hid his face from him, and left him
destitute of the hope of salvation, the cause whereof he declares in the first
words of the verse to have bin, because he held his peace that is denied to
make a liberal confession of his sins, refusing no shame not other abasement
what-so-euer belonging thereto, whereinto the holy Ghost reaches us, that
cloking of sin, howsoever it serves for an excuse in the world and saves our
credit amoungst men: Yet it keeps his conscience upon the rack, and makes
the arrowhead of despair to ranckle in his bowels, whereto the saying of
SOLOMON agrees in that 2^. of PROVERBS, That he which hides his sin shall
not prosper, but he which confesses them, and leaves them, shall find
mercy. But this sentence before we proceed further, if it respects
confession to be made to God only, and not to the Church, has need of
exposition: For if DAVID might have bin released from the torments which he
here speaks of, with a secret confession unto God, all other witnesses being
removed, so that no discredit might redound ^o him thereby, it seems strange,
that he would abide such troubles the space of an hour, and would not rather
get him into some secret place, and in most ample manner confess all the
wickedness that he could remember, that he had committed ever in his life. The
holy Ghost therefore in this place, by DAVID his silence, intends some
greater crime against him, then that he was dainty of his words, and refused
with his tongue to make confession unto God; for it is certain that a domme man
may make as acceptable a confession, as he that can speak, but DAVID in this
place accuses himself of hypocrisy, and hardness of heart, ^n this, that he
refused to deal seriously with his own conscience, and to persist ^n the
meditation of mortification, till such time as he had a sufficient sight and
detestation of his sin, without which, ^ll the confession of men must be
hypocritical, and their smoke infect the air. This then indeed was David's
silence, that he refused to give answer to the holy Ghost calling upon his
conscience, and for want of faith was kept either with some presumption, or
else with some terror from entering into a most grave consultation, and
resolute determination, to take such perfect notise of the haynousnes of his
sins, as the nature of true repentance does require: for this is common to us
all, that although we desire to be saved, yet there is not one amongst an
hundredth that will task himself so zealouslie, as he ought with a sincere
perseverance in humbling himself to walk with God; yea, and least any man
should resolve with himself, not to be stripped of sackcloth, and ashes, nor
to put away the purpose of sorrow, and lamentation, in seeking after his
well-beloved (as it is in the song of SOLOMON) till he had found her. The devil
has infected the hearts of many men with a damnable error in the definition
o^ repentance, making them believe, that, every terror of the heart for sin,
is the nature of true repentance, and to that purpose he abuses the
Scriptures, that CHRIST will not quench the smoking flax, nor break the
bruised reed. And by these fallacions and false comfortes, he quenches the
zeal of many, and makes them give over their labor and consultationes of
humbling themselves and seeking of CHRIST, before their conscience have felt
any comfort at all. As if every sorrow were godly sorrow, or as if it were
possible for mercy to be found and yet never felt, or for repentance to be
separated from faith, and the spirit of fredome. This cursed discontinuance of
our travel in Godly sorrow, the Prophet ESAIAS derideth, calling penance for a
day, and bowing down the head lik a Bulrush. And the Prophet AMOS likeneth
it, to the dew and the Morning cloud which is suddenly gone, And this is
the swept and garnished house, mentioned by CHRIST, Repossessed by seven worser
spirits then before: For as this false repentance, feeds their heart with
false hope, and suffers not true comfort to take place; as appears in the
day of visitation: So may this negligence, and giving over our labor in
mortification, be worthelie accounted the cause, why men wallow in fowler
enormities then before, swallowing again, (as S. PETER says) The vomit which
before they had cast; as it is most certain and true: those men find in
themselves less power to do well; and are carried with more raging affections
to do wickedlie, then ever they felt before. What shall we say then? Do we
require such a measure of sorrow, as might counterweight the same; or do we
esteem remission, by the dignity of repentance? nothing less: For we know,
that if we had a thousand eyes, it were too little to weep them out all,
because of our sins: yea, if we had a thousand hearts, though they al burst
with sorrow because of our transgressions; yet it were not this, but Christ's
heart blood, that could make the fathers heart to yearne; or could merit
remission at his hands; what is it then that we require? namely, that men
return not from the school of repentance to worldly delights, which quench
the spirit, till their hearts be made joyful by the holy Ghost, by feeling
an hearty detestation of their wickedness, and a resolute determination to
continue cherefully in the course of godliness, so long, until both faith and
hope be abolished, that then resting from their labors, they may solace
themselves with love celestial, as saint PAVLE speaks; for the truth is,
that many when they compare themselves with DAVID and other of Gods children,
I mean the difficulties and long afflictions of them, and the short work
which they themselus have made, and so easiely dispatched in this work of
repentance, have cause to suspect themselves vehemently, and to examine
themselves straightly, by the fruits of feeling, and conversion, whether they
have right repented or no* Saint PAVL in the 2. Epistle to the Cor. the 7.
Cap. like a man of experience, sets down seven notable affectes of
repentance; I would they were well perused, that we might try our selves by
them, for it is a care that ought to possess all the powers both of body and
soul; considdering that Satan with this engine, makes a number of souls
pertakers of their own condemnation* The matter therefore grows to this
point, that although we confess never so absolutely, that we are sinners,
with the greatest vehemence of speech that can be, yet so long as there
remains self-love in us, prevailing so far with us, as to make us take
exceptions against the severity of this spiritual discipline all this while;
because we cannot find in our hearts to pluck out our eyes and cut off our
hands, at Christ's commandemente: that is, to deal severely with our selves
in mortifying every provocation to offense: we do but flatter our breath in
the wind, and the hypocrise that is in us drowneth the sound of our
confession, so as A voice cannot ^e heard, as the Prophet ESAIAS witnesses. Let
us therefore as we are advised in the REVELATION, be zealous in repen^ance, that
the holy Ghost may assure our conscience, that our mourning is grown into the
nature of true repentance, not deceauing our selves with beginninges, because
the Scripture says plainly, that the proceedinges of a ^rue convert, is not
to stay himself with a persuasion of repentance, when he ^s pricked at the
heart; but to step yet further, to lay hold upon repentance it self, as
upon a more excellent and infal^ible grace; as we may read, that it befell ^o
PETER'S auditorie, in that 2. of the ACTS, of whom the holy Ghost says,
first, That they were pricked in their hearts; which least it should be taken
for ^epentance, he says, that upon further ^nstruction, and more careful
search, they atteyned to repentance it self afterward, that we may know,
that pricking at the heart, and repentance are not all one, but two several
things, whereof one may be in a lost child, as that was in IVDAS, but the
other belongs oneli^ to the sons and daughters of God. Thu^ has DAVID
declared how he brought himself into fearful troubles, (as i^ were) by
gagging of his own conscience, least he should make such a confession as it
required at his hands.

Now it remains to be considere^ what troubles those were. My bones sait^ he,
consumed and waxed old, etc. That is care which eats out the heart, mad^
her impressione in my body, and the thoughts which I had taken, did so pyn^ me
away, that it burns the marrow^ out of my bones, and dries up my youthful
humors with pensiuenes (as it ha^ been with old age) which he repeateth in
the next verse in other words saying, That the hand of God was so he (...)
upon him day and night, that it spent his nature, and turned the best moisture
within (...) into the drought of summer; as if it had been entering into the
most incurable consumption of all otheres, when that which is called, humidum
radicale, begins to spend. These speeches are used ^o teach us into what
plight, concealing of sin brings men, and we are the rather enforced, that
we should not think that these clouds would be so easily ouer-blowne, as
those miseries which proceed of worldly causes. Mark then, what we have to
learn in this place, what is the estate of them which be not in league with
God, if we look upon them with a worldly eye; I confess we shall see many of
them with their breasts full of milk, and their bones full of marrowe: yea
they have collopes in their flanks, (as JOB says) but if we look upon their
condition with a spiritual eye, we shall well perceive, that their conscience
as often as their presumptione is intermitted, is nothing-els but an hell, and
themselves so terified with the horrible stiching thereof, that it works the^
more woe nor all their worldly peace i^ worth: for such is the estate of men
no^ reconciled to God, That the sound of fear^ is never out of their ears, (as
we read i^ JOB,) and this is the cause why these men cannot sustain to hear
the judgment of God against sin, because they think themselves all the while
to be arrained at Gods bar; for where there i^ no truce with God, the law
goareth the conscience, and the soul thinks i^ self tormented before the
time: and i^ this be so, how great is the hardness o^ those men's hearts? and
how monsterous is their cruelty to their own souls* which can shake of the
care of reconcilement, and can rejoice with a Sardinian laughter in sin, when
the Lord bends his brows against them. Furthermore, we have here an ample
testimony of the frowardnes of our nature* which will not be reclamed without
extreme dealing; for DAVID himself (you see) is laid upon the rack, and
almost streached a sunder, every ioynte one from another, before he can be
brought to a sincere confession, such a work has the Lord with us before he
can make any grace to grow in our ^eartes, which ought to teach us these ^wo
things. First, that we enter into an ^eartie mislike of our selves, and to be
^rieuously displeased with our vntracta^lenes, which compels God to hear us
up, and cast us down against the ground; (As DAVID else where says,) and to
^fflict many so sore, that (God his secret grace excepted) they seem otherwise
^n respect of the marvelous afflictions which God is driven to lay upon them,
^o be shackled foot to foot, with re^robate and desperate persons: all this I
say) proceeding, not of cruelty or fu^^ in the Lord, but of our own
vn^ractablenes (who otherwise could not ^ossibly be saved) should make us to
be (...) perpetual war with our affections, and to conceive a present hatred,
as it ^ere, even of our selves: for if the Lord might epsy that in us, that
we would Judge our selves, he would not be our judge, but our comforter in
such a conflict. The next thing that we have to learn, is to judge wisely of
the afflicted soul, and to beware how we condemn^ any, because the hand of
God is terrible upon them, for the text says, that even DAVID himself, who
had conscience of some former sincerity, and wa^ able to subdue many
assaults, and tentations in knowledge, yet was he eve^ brought to the brinke
of despair, an^ was tormented with an horrible fear^ of damnation: even as it
is usual with God to exercise his children with those trials, no otherwise,
nor if he whippe^ them with Scorpions. The worldly^ men, which never were
translated from death to life, being ignorant of God^ spiritual miracles; in
calling; mortifying, regenerating, and chastening o^ his children, when they
see a man in thi^ perplexity; they say he is mad, melancholious and
desperate, increasing the griefs of the afflicted, with bitter tantes and
mockes; which is to be feared, many one day will rue it. It stands us
therefore in hand, to expel such uncharitable conceits; knowing that the
dearest children of God, may be wonderfully perplexed and racked with
exceeding and long torments of conscience; yea, many times their sail is rent
in pieces; their tackles, and all their tackling burst; their bruised bark left
to the wild waters and the wind; and yet for all that, at the last they
obtain a safe aryval to the shore. Let us then, for the conclusion of this
point (if any such thing be fall us) beware to lay any vn-reasonable thing to
Gods charge; yea, rather let us acknowledge his mercy; who, when he might have
punished our long and tedious hypocrisy, with hardness of heart; choose
rather to put himself to all that pain, to reclayme us by correction, that
we might take heed to our sores, how we suffer them to run long cured on
the outside, but festering within; knowing that by these means, we shall put
our selves to greater pains at the last, before they can be cured: how-be-it,
for that which is past, and cannot be revoked; let us not be dismayed with this
example, from submitting our selves to the mighty hand of GOD, For he is a
faithful keeper of souls, and will not suffer them to be tempted, above
(measure, or) their power. Thus having considered the effect of DAVID his
silence, we are to give heed to a special circumstance, which he sets down
in these words, that He roared all the day long. Signifying thereby, that his
prayers so long as they were not mixed with faith, nor seasoned with true
repentance, were no better then roaring: That is, then the crying or bellowing
of some brutish and vn-reasonable creature. For this is a metaphore, taken
from Lions, taken in a snare, or being in some other distress, as appears in
the third chapter of Amos, and in other places, where the word is used in his
proper signification; whereby we learn, what difference there is, betwixt the
prayers of the faithful, and of them which nowrish fraud and deceit ^n their
spirit: The sacrifice of the one is ^indled from heaven, and when he has
^oured out his spirit, he has eased his heart; having cast his burden and
care ^herof upon the shoulders of CHRIST: ^ut the hypocrite, in the day of
visitation, fares like a beast that is sticked or ^aled with ropes, wanting
all reason and forecast to help it self: and therefore uses no meekness
nor entreatie, but with roaring and struggling, strayneth it self, and tangleth
it self more; and with brutish raging, doubleth the pain. There ^s no doubt,
but where great afflictions ^ight upon men that are taynted with hypocrisy:
the air is beaten with many such roaringes, and men flutter like birds in
the net, when God has caught them: but all those senseless prayers a^aile
them nothing more, then if an Ox should break out of the slaughterhouse, with
the roape tied about his horns, and his tongue hanging out, with much bellowing
and madness, when he had caught a knock with the axe. And therefore we may see
the excellency of faithful prayers: Yea, the Angel of GOD does ascend up in
the smoke of this sacrifice, whereas men that will not yield, but will reteyne
their sins, cannot pray, but rage and roar desperately, like Lions and Bears.
Nevertheless, it behooves us wisely to understand this doctrine, that it
concerns hypocrites, and them that hold their falsehood in the right hand. I
say, it belongs to them, because they have not faith, nor consolation in
their prayers: For otherwise, it is certain, that the most excellent children
of GOD, are many times so low brought, with the anguish of an afflicted
conscience, that they cannot utter any perfect prayers with their lips: but
do speak abruptly half sentences; yea, half words, being broken off with
the extreamitie of their pangues that come betuixt; (As Ezechiah writes of
himself) That he chattered like a Crane or (...) Swallow, and mourned like a
Dove. And there is no doubt, but all Gods Children do feel a strife and a
combat in their spirit, in many of their prayers; even as we see green-wood
lies sobbing and smoking long before it will burn: We are therefore to put a
differance between this and roaring; because the Scriptures are full of
examples of imperfite speeches in the prayers of Gods children: yea, in the
prayers of CHRIST himself; which comes to pass, because many of those
sacrifices, are so seasoned and peppered with salt, and with fire; yea,
afflictions come so thick on Gods children, that they have no time to swallow
their spittle: But yet in them there is a sweet sense of Gods grace; and the
Lord inlargeth the footing under them; yea, he puts his own arm betuixt them
and the grave, that they should not bruise themselves with any fall; for
although he leave some trouble of mind, yet he looks upon them through the
chinkes of the door, he has compassion of their dolorous lamentations, and
puts all their tears into a bottel: For why, they have yielded unto GOD,
they have kept nothing back, and therefore can pray with a feeling spirit;
whereas the hypocrite does not pray, but roar; because he will not trust God:
For an evil conscience, does stop his mouth, and the sins of his youth, are
still in his bones.

5 Then I acknowledged my sin to thee, neither hid I mine iniquity; for I
thought, I will confess against my self my wickedness unto the Lord; and
thou tookest away the punishment of my sin. Selath,.
Then I acknowledged my sin, etc.) Thus far DAVID has set forth by his
own example, the disquietnes of them which hold their peace; and refuse in
simplicity of heart, to make confession of their sins. Now on the contrary
part, he shows by his own experience; what is the effect of Gods grace,
when it has brought men to godly humility, to resolve to confess their
sins to God, in that which follows next. Then I acknowledge my sins unto
thee, etc. This diligence in describing his confession in so many words, that
he would make known his sin, and would not hide iniquity; but confess his
apostasy unto the Lord; does declare, that he has gotten the victory over
all hypocrisy; and at the last, after long siege, ^ad gotten the hold of
simplicity, and sincerity: So as now, there remained no ^urning, nor winding,
nor extenuating of his sin, when he had to do with GOD, as there was
before. As for the Lord, he is not hindered with any im^ediment of ignorance,
or dullness, that ^e should not know by a word, what the ^hole means; yea,
though he confess ^o sin at all; yet for his part he takes ^erfite notice
of all our offenses without us. It is not then for his sake, that we ^ake any
confession, as if we could a^^se him by our hypocrisy, for he see^th through
the dark clouds: but it is for our own sakes; to the end; that comparing our
lives, with the commandments of God; and confessing how much we swerve from
that holy rule, we might be stirred up to great contrition, and might be more
deeply set in the meditation of our own unworthiness, that being so humbled,
Gods spirit might take occasion to fasten upon us, and to lay sure hold upon
our hearts* Thus we see, that it is the nature of true confession to aggrauate
our sins, acknowledging that confusion of face belongs to us, and charging
upon our heads, the sins of our selves, of our fathers and children, wives,
friends, and all others; so far as our guiltiness may any way stretch; not
in any set or labored phrase of speech, but from a conscience nurtured with
fear and trembling, under the just hand of GOD: i^ this sort, the Prophet
calls himself (...) beast before God; And Saint PAVLL accuses himself of
blasphemy before his conversion, affirming, not with feigned humility: but
even as he thought ^n his heart, that he was the chiefest sin^er amongst them,
whom CHRIST ^ame to save. And in the Primitive Church, Saint PAVLL shows,
what ^umilitie was joined to the confession ^f them which were converted by
hea^ing the Prophecies, or exercises then ^sed; that they fell upon their
faces. As ^ndeede, if we be endued with the Spi^ite of true repentance, we can
find in ^ur hearts to humble our selves, even ^elow to the ground: and the
very cause why sinners make it so strange, is, because the spirit of pride
has still the pos^ession of their hearts; which evil spirit, ^ust be cast out
of us, before we can make ^nie such confession, as God will accept ^f at our
hands. There is another thing, which the holy Ghost sets down ^o be marked
in this place; namely, that ^he children of God have a joyful issue ^f all
their temptations, that the Lord ^ill bring some excellent thing to pass
(...) the last; by afflicting his, which is their mortification and
sanctification: For this is the end of all his hewing, to mak^ them living
stones fit to his Church, an^ sorting to the chief corner stone, which (...)
our Lord JESUS CHRIST; to whose ^mage by this means we are confo^med. If the
Lord had brought all the world unto captivity under DAVID yet, if hypocrisy
had rested in his hear^ it had been all accursed to him: but no^ that the Lord
has renewed a right sp^rite in him, both heaven and earth a^^ sanctified to
his use: But above all, he has gotten the liberty of conscienc^ and sings
with a joyful note: Th^^ have taken away the punishment of my sinn^ This is al
in all, that his soul is refreshe^ with the feeling of remission; and s^ soon
as the Lord saw him willin^ to judge himself, he steppeth from the tribunal
seat, to the bar; and of his judge becomes his Advocat, to plead for him;
taking away the punishment of hi^ sin, which being so; who is he, wh^ will be
affrayd to deal seuerlie with hi^ self, to call his conscience to a
recko^ing, that he might repent him serious^^e of his sin? Who shall
blaspheme his way any more? calling it the way ^f desperation, since we see
the contrararie in the example of DAVID; who ^^so tells us else where, That
with God is ^ercie, that he might be feared: Whereto, ^aint JOHN also agrees,
denying that ^^ee have any such cause to dread dis^aire: For if we
acknowledge our sins says he) he will not take us at the van^ge, and
condemn us out of our own ^outhes, but he is faithful and just, to ^^rgiue
us our sins, and cleanse us from ^^l unrighteousness: Yea, many times ^od
chideth and comfort both at ^ne instant: as we may see in the exam^le of the
woman of Syrophenisse; who, if he had been terrified, with the sharp ^^buke
of CHRIST, she had lost her ^^bour, and the commendation of her ^ith.

At the end of this verse, and the former, ^^e sets this word Selah; which
is a note of attention, staying the meditation longer upon these two sentences,
the^ upon the rest; declaring thereby his judgment, that both these his
contrary conditions, are worthy of observing, because they afflicted his
heart exceedingly. Whereout we learn, that we ough^ not to pass by Gods
proceedings, with a conscience blinde-fold; nor carelessly to passe-ouer, the
strange things that w^ read, in the secret book of our conscience: but
when-so-euer we hitte upon such notable experiences, to turn in a leaf
there; to mark it with a Selah, and to peruse it over again and again, that
we might get some holy experiences in matters of conscience; for this is the
manner of Gods servants, to be cunning in the estate of their own conscience;
that they may know what kind of Physic will best agree with them: For
default whereof, we see many men's consciences by their own confession, to
have surfeted often of the same things; and to have escaped the fruit of many
heavenly motions, which ^f they had been received, might have ^urnished them
with much riches of ^odlie meditations. And indeed, this is ^he cause why the
Psalter is more divine ^or all the rest of the Bible; because, ^hen the Lord
had spoken once, DA^ID heard him twice; and all the way ^s he marched, he set
down the gestes and circumstances of every days jour^ey in a Commentary; so
that his ex^erience, committed to the godly me^orie, made him to excel in the
sight, ^oth of Angels and men.

6 Therefore shall every one that is godly,^ake his prayer unto thee, in a
time when ^^ou may be found; surely in the flood of ^ea: waters, they
shall not come near thee.
This far reaches the first part of ^^e Psalm, propounding that general
^octrine; that sincere confession to God necessary for the quieting of the
con^ience; without which, it is impossible (...) attain the peace of God, and
the ^^ling of forgiveness in the heart, as DAVID has made it plain by his
ow^^ experience, on both the sides. Now follows the second part of the
Psalm^ which is the application of the said doctrine, containing in it a
declaration o^ the deuties, which men are to be styrred up unto thereby;
whereof, the one is earnest and faithful prayer; and the other is quiet and
peaceable obedience to the calling of God; and the said application begins
thus; Therefore shall every o^^ that is godly, etc.

Here the Prophet DAVID inferret^ a consequent, upon the mercy which God
showed him, when he had shaken of all hypocrisy, and had gone directly to the
matter; that either men should be provoked to godliness, by the consideration
thereof, for there is no other end why the infirmities of the Patriarcke^ and
Prophets are set down in Scripture; But for our comfort and instruction, (as
Saint PAVLL says) It is sure, that profane men, as they pervert the use o^
all things, so do they abuse all those examples, as if it were some excuse to
adulterers and drunkards; to mention the ^alles of DAVID and LOT; whereas in
them the Lord has declared the weak^es of the best, when God with-draweth ^is
spirit, and that no such sin is vn^ardonable; if men will return as they
^id; as it must be a great encouragement ^o present our selves before God, when
we see how well others have spe^de before us: There is none example in all the
Scriptures, of any that ever sped evil, ^y confessing his sin to the Lord,
what-so-euer the sin were: For there ^s not any sin, but some of Gods
chil^ren have fallen into it; so it has been ^he case before* and we may be
encou^aged by their example, to wade out as ^hey did: Yea, we shall find more
case ^y their experience: for even as they which first sailed in the Seas, gave
pro^^er names to dangerous rocks, and pe^^lous places, where they hardly
esca^ed with their lives; to the end, that the ^osteritie by such marks, might
shun shipwreck, and pass safely away; calling such places diversely, as the
Sage-bed, the Lavender-bed, with other like names best known to Sailors; and
as Carters use to set up some bush or other like mark in that place, where their
waine stack fast, for a warning to them that come after: so have the godly
Fathers furthered us, by their experience, and taught us to eschew many
encombrances, which they (because they break the Ice first themselves) could
not see: and this observation in the story of JOB, commends his faith
exceedingly, for he seemed to have dwelt far from Gods people; and to have
been destitute in so great affliction of all these incouragementes; so that if
life and soul had not bin kept together, by restoratiues of the holy Ghostes
own compounding, he might have despaired a thousand times. It may be, he had
read the books of MOSES; but yet that was nothing, in comparison of the
comfortes, which we may have: Therefore, let us lay up this lesson in our
hearts, that although God should carry us away into Tartaria, ^o that in
sickness of our conscience: we could have neither Preacher nor friends
present with us, to minister spiritual comfort: It should suffice us, that we
have the advice and example of the Prophets and Apostles; though parents,
wives, children, be a thousand miles from us, and all other acquaintance: for
what a glorious visitation of the sick is that, when we have Patriarchs,
Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors; yea, and CHRIST himself, standing
round about the bed; comforting and chearing us up: If we say we be sick at
the heart, because we have lived ryotouslie and venterouslie; he that was
the prodigal child, takes the taill by the end, and shows how he himself
once labored of the same desease, but now is clean rid of all the dregs of
that sickness. If the patient reply and say that his sickness is a
reciduation (as the Physicians calls it) and that he has fallen into it
again, since his profession of religion: The Prophet DAVID answers him
fully to that matter, declaring, that his sickness answers in that
circumstance, to a soar malady of his own: For I also (says DAVID,) was a
principal professor, before I committed these two most horrible crimes, as
all the world knows: But my disease (says the patient) is old, and of
long continuance (yea and I says DAVID) played the hypocrite a year. If he
have been a persecutor of the Church, PAVL comfort him; If he have denied
CHRIST, though it were with perjurie; PETER steppeth forth and shows his own
example; finally, they all direct him to the Physician which stands by,
feeling his pulse, (for they were all cured by one doctor) advising him to
give over himself to be ordered by him, and the same is JESUS CHRIST. Now if
in the sickness of the soul there be so many visitors of such sundry
experience, all reason does exact by their example, that therefore every
faithful man do pray unto God in his adversity to be made partaker of the like
remedy.

Now it follows that we see whi^herto DAVID does exhort men in this
^pplication, and that is first to the deutie of prayer, saying, Therefore shall
every faithful man pray unto thee: especially he aymeth at that part of
prayer which is spoken of in his own example; to wit, confession: In place
whereof he puts this general word, which comprehends all kind of
supplications, wherein we ^ske, confess, thank, or praise God for any thing,
teaching us by this advise, the certain comfort which is to be found in true
prayer, that it is the tower of the faithful, wherein they continue themselves
when the enemy assaulteth them; even as God appointed them in the 50. Psalm.
Telling us that when we are in trouble we shall call upon him, and he will
deliver us, and SOLOMON in the dedication of the Temple, desires God that the
same effect be given to prayer, which is here spoken of, That the floods of
waters may not come near; that is, when men are in peril and terror, if they
confess their sins and make their supplications to God he would deliver them, as
indeed there is no other so direct means, whereby to have access to God as
prayer, neither does God make answer out of the heaven to any thing that we
prefer to him so manifestly as to prayer; for he delights in the soul of
that sacrifice more the^ in all other. And therefore the Angels are said to be
employed in carrying up the prayers of saints, as if God had preferred the^
more in assigning them that office then in any other thing, and the excellency
hereof is commended in this also, that whereas diverse other virtues may be
outwardlye performed by those that are strangers to Gods covenant, though
without sincerity there was never any vouchsafed to conceive three words of a
faithful prayer, but if he be the undoubted child of God. Let us then give
heed to this counsel, and wrestle with our selves from morning to night, to
perform this duty, which done sincerely in any measure at all, shall do us
more good in our miseries then all other remedies beside. It is common to be
seen, when the hand of God is upon men, That the waters begin to come upon
them, they seek after help, and succor twenty ways, but they are al
worldly, and not able to give them any comfort. As for prayer, because they
have not used themselves thereto, neither their memory nor their skill does
serve them, but for want of faith and calling upon Gods name, the floudes of
great waters bursteth in upon them, and they perish miserably. Yea, and
these examples are very common amongst us in time of great calamity when men
going out of the world, cannot be brought to any comfortable performance of
this duty, but are feareful^y deprived of their souls, before they have given
any comfortable marks of their faith. There are many which can conceive the
words of prayer eloquently, but the comfort is his only which can pray
faithfully; and therefore our hearts must be exercised therein, and then our
tongs shall be taught to pray more sweetly unto God, then if we had studied
our wits to set every word in order: for even as every florisher or fenser
proves not a tall man when he comes to fight in good earnest; no more are
those prayers found effectual, neither can such men speak a word to the
purpose when affliction has laid hold on them indeed. When as a true
christian never shows his manhood, nor his cunning in this weapon of prayer,
more then when he is to fight for life and death, and the greater the danger
is, with so much the stouter courage is he endued. And that also is worthy the
marking in this place, that in a calamity which seems incurable when the
hands of worldly men do faint, and politickes ar at their wits end, then
there is succor in prayer, and there is comfort in calling upon the name of
God, for though (says he) that prayer shall turn away the floods of great
waters, that although our troubles were as the sea, whose violent course
cannot be ^^rned, and whose merciless waters cannot be stopped, yet prayer
makes them ^o fly back-warde, as it were against nature; so that the raiging
and untamed floods of great waters dare not come ^eare. And how much does this
extol ^he excellent estate of Gods children, who ar furnished with remedies
against ^emedilesse things, and with cures for ^ncurable wounds; even as it
is the nature of faith, not to boast it self in ^hinges that are seen (as the
Apostle ^aith) where there is no need, but to be ^ccupied about things
invisible and im^ossible to the flesh. Saying,

7 Thou art my secret place, thou preseruest ^^e from trouble, thou compassest
me about ^ith joyful deliverance. Selah.
In this next verse, the Prophet seteth down a short form of prayer to ^e
used of the faithful, wherein the proposition is a petition to be preserved i^
misery, on these words, keep me from distress, or in the strayt of my
troubles; which is enforced first by an argument taken from their faith, which
expects the invisible grace and defense of God when all the world denies
succor, th^^ art my secret place. Secondly, by the effect of the said
deliverance, that the children of God shall be stirred up to the second duty of
prayer which is to praise and glorify Gods name. Thou shall compass me about
with songs of thanksgiving In the first where the faithful are taught to
call God, their secret place, is meant that they acknowledge the especial car^
of God over such as call rightly upon his name, that he is their refuge, and
dot^ secretly, and with grace (which the worl^ is not vouchsafed with the sight
of) protect and sustain his, so as they remain^ safe, when the world looks
that the^ shall be ouer-whelmed with despair an^ calamities. And this
administration o^ God, does astonishe the world wo^derfullie, when they see a
poor silly ^odie, who has no abettor or mayn^eyner, nor any man of
countenance ^o back him; but that he is like a low ^edge, which every man may
step over, ^ot to be dismayde with all this, but ^o lay him down (as DAVID
says) and sleep in much security, when his ^nemies keep stout watch and
pitch^th their tents against him; JOBS wife ^sketh such a question of her
husband; and that with much indignation; Do thou still persist in thine
integrity? Thinking it absurd, that he should be ^onstant in avouching the
righteousness ^f God; when there appeared no token, ^ut of his wrath and fury:
Assuredly, all ^he confidence of men, which they ^aue in worldly munitions,
and all other means of safety; are like the house ^f a spyder, in comparison
of this: And therefore, we see oftentimes, their Sun ^oeth down at noone; but
when God ^^deth his children, under the lap of ^s garment; neither men nor
devils (...) enemies shall not terrify us; but ou^ eyes being opened by
prayer, shall be hold the mountains overspread wit^ Angels; and we shall
see, that which they cannot discern: namely, that ther^ are more with us, than
with them (as th^^ Scripture says.)

The next reason to move God t^ save his Children in their straight; i^ that
he may compass them about wit^ songs of thanksgiving; that is, by de^^uering
them, he might minister occa^^on of his own praises, as it is in the (...)
Psalm. Open my lips, and my mouth sha^^ show forth thy praise. This as I
said, is the second part of prayer, where-unto the people were moved, under
the ceremonial law, by straight paying of vowe^^ least the fear of God,
should be dim^nished in them by prosperity and hear^ case; whereby appears,
that this du^ty of thanksgiving, carefully perfo^med, is a singular exercise
of faith; when men standing upon the shore, and beholding the dangerous and
tumultuou^ Seas, which they have pass^d, are stirred (...) to sacrifice praise
and glory to him (...) the same. And thi^ service the Lord ^oth greatly
accept, and takes much (...) light in it; yea, it is a further work of ^^ith,
then petition, which is the former ^^rte of prayer: for those which are but
^^lightned against death, may serve in a ^^^t to make some petitions to God;
but ^^ey never be-think them at all, of the ^^tie of thanksgiving, when they
have ^^c^^ued benefits of him: And for this ^^u^e nine of the leapers which
Christ ^e^s^d are defamed to all posterity by ^^e holy Ghost in the Gospel:
For there as nothing more odious nor this sin; ^^d therefore God has not so
much ^^t it to the censure of the Church, but ^^th reserved it to his own
judgment. ^et us then labor to purge our selves (...) ^uch a wickedness,
spending much (...) our time, in the songs of thanks-gi^^ng, since God has
compassed us a^^ut with them, and has given us so ^^nie occ^siones to praise
his name. The book of the Psalms, though it consist much of the first part of
prayer, an^ be full of petitions: yet in the Hebrew title, is called A Book of
praises, name^ by the Church, as it were of the mo^^ honorable part of prayer:
and indeed such has been the thankfulness o^ Gods children, that their love
cannon keep within the banks, but burst fort^ into the praise of God, in the
midde^^ of some other treatise, as we may observe in Saint PAVLL, in the first
to the Romans verse 25. To be brief, the exce^lencie of thanksgiving, shows
it sel^^ here in that, whereas men make petit^ons, it is of love and care of
themselves* For the supply either of spiritual o^ bodily wantes, but where
men offe^ thanks, it is of a kind heart, of a loving and honorable affection,
conceived toward God, when they strive with themselves, and are in a sort
grieved, th^^ they have nothing worthy in them t^ render for all his loving
kindness: an^ that their love cannot extend to him, a^ we read in the 16.
Psalm.

8 I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the ^^y that thou shall go, and I
will guide thee ^ith mine eye.

9 Be ye not like a Horse or like a Mule, which ^nderstand not; whose mouths
thou do ^nde with bitte and bridle, least they come ^eere thee.

10 Many sorrows shall come to the ^^cked, but he that trusts in the Lord,
mer^^^ shall compass him.


Hitherto reaches the first part of ^he application, as touching the duty
^^t Prayer: The second part follows, ^erswading to obedience: For the better
performance whereof, the Prophet DAVID, turning himself to the faithful,
promises to be their guide therein: and this his guidance (he says) shall
con^^st, first, in instructing them, and advising them in the way wherein they
should walk (...) then in guiding them with his eye. By ^he first, he means
that he will teach them out of the word of God, the true ^uties of obedience,
according to his Prophetical function, and the performing of this duty ^e
signifies, by varying the same things with diverse Phrases, that he will be
painful and plain in teaching them, giving such manifest directions, as if
the way were chalked before them. Thus he uses an argument to persuade to
obedience, which indeed, in foldeth in it many arguments: That King DAVID,
that Prophet of the Lord, a man of singular experience in spiritual affairs
would be their skoole-maister, and that in most plain and paineful manner,
whereout we learn this doctrine: That when the Lord sends fit instruments
into the Church, which have both skill and will, to feed it with hands of
discretion, it ought to be an argument o^ obedience, to all that have a sparkle
of Gods grace. To this purpose, the Apostle Sant PAVLL puts the Galathians
in mind, that he had used such diligence, and playnenes, in preaching the
passion of the lord, and had done it so lively, as if indeed they had seen
CHRIST JESUS crucified before their eyes, and because the labor of the
Prophets, performed in this plain manner, wrought nothing among the Jews: The
Prophet ESAI^, cap. 18. denounces Gods judgments against them; and after, he
shows by two familiar comparisons, how they had been instructed as Children,
that learn the A. B. C. which name the letters after their skoole master; and
as they which have their hands led, when they learn to write; which he
means by these phrases; that precep^ ^ath been upon precept, and line upon
line. And herein they to whose charge it ^ppertayneth, are taught not to be
stamering or squemish, but like loving nurses, to take all in good worth,
though they have many a foul hand with the rude people, even as Saint PAVLL
sets himself forth for ^n example, when he says, that he traveled
again with the GALATHIANS although one travel is as much as a woman is able
to bear for her own child. I would we had learned well this lesson, that such
as teach others, were not carried away with the spirit of nicenes, and
vainglory: so a great part of Ministers, whether of a base opinion that
they have conceived of Catechizing; as too low a thing for their excellentnes
or whether of any irksomeness to travel with the rude and forgetful people;
or for what other cause I know not; whilst they preach themselves and let
their own gestes take wind, leave the people vninstructed in the necessary
points of salvation, not leading them as they ought, in the way wherein the^
should walk. On the other side, the people in many places, though they have
this argument to move them to obedience; that is, a paynefull and godly pastor,
yet they are moved hereby nothing at all, but had rather have such an one as
should Prophecy no more unto them in the name of the Lord, yea it is to be
thought: that the number of good teachers had bin greater if such as love ^not
instruction had not given the NA^^RITES wine to drink, they which ^ have none
to instruct them, hope to be excused by ignorance, though vainelie, but to them
which have a teacher, and ^efuseth admonitions, there remains neither hope,
nor excuse, for even the prayer of them which will not hear; shall be
abominable (says SOLOMON.)

The next point is, that he will guide them with his eyes, which is more nor
the former: for he promises not only with general exhortation to do what
good he can, but also to attend upon them with his eyes, and at every turn
to help their wandering, and to go in and out before them himself, which how
well he performed in his ordinary, calling of a king, and in extraordinary as
he was a Prophet, the Scriptures give ample testimony. This place teaches us,
that the continual presence of the teacher (necessity only excepted) is a
forcible means to bring men into obedience as may appear both by the
Scriptures, and by reason: for we know, that a friend of approved godliness and
wisdom, whom we use familiarly, and into whose bosom we may empty our
secreetes, shall prevail more with us then any stranger whatsoever. And
therefore S. PAVL forbids the minister to bear himself coylie and stately
amongst the people, but to be gentle and easy to be spoken to, to the end that
acquaintance may win love, and love may gain obedience, and for this cause
the people are compared to sheep; which know their own shepheardes whistle,
from all others by daily use. It is certain enough, that where the teacher
never attends on his office; but in the pulpet; there the people ar sheep
which feed in low places, at their own wills do rot for want of a better
shepherd. S. PAVL in his farewell sermon to the Ephesians, lays this example
of his before the Ministers, that he had taught to the people house by house,
and the same Apostle shows that the Levites were maintained of the ALTAR upon
this condition, that they were resident at the same. Those therefore that are
the Ministers of JESUS CHRIST, their love to him will move them, the word of
God will command them, the example of DAVID and all good overseers will meet
them, compassion of the people, and dread to murder the souls which CHRIST
has purchased with his own blood, will provoke, inioyne and constrain them,
With diligence to feed that ^^e^ke which depends upon them. The
temptations which draw a man from this duty are gross, and such as even the
shame of the world might shift off: how much more should Gods spirit prevail
against them; for the gaynes which is gotten by spiritual promotions joined
with spiritual distructions; is more shameful and infamous, then the gains
of the usurer or of the promouter; yea it is the most odious and barbarous
shifte that the devil can devise.

BALAAMS bribe is called the wages o^ iniquity; but this filthy lucre (I speak
a reproachful thing) is the Hang-mans wages, for the loss of the precious
lives and souls of men is their booty: But of this matter, the complaints
amongst men are so manifold, and the supplications to God for reformation are
so infinite, that it seems fitter to expect what God will do, then to preach
any longer to the belly that has no ears.

This much has been spoken of the promise which DAVID makes, to instruct and
guide the people; used by him as an argument to move them to docility and
obedience. Now for as much as the most part when they are to be ordered by
good Discipline, do fare like wild creatures: he dehorteth the^ from the
same, showing what will be the effect of disobedience, that it will bring a
double pain upon them, and make them to have a rougher and greater bitte in
their mouths; that is, they shall be constrained to yield to their grief and
pain, if they will not show themselves ^^actable by fair means. But before
he ^^eth this argument, he makes the sin (...) vntractablenes odious, by
comparing (...) with the brutishnes of horses and mules, which are not well
broken, who many ^^mes seek to mischief their keepers; (...) a wild horse,
if he cannot by kicking ^^d rearing cast his ryder, watches the ^^me til the
rain be slacked, and getting ^he bit betuixt his teeth, sets his tail
(...) end, and runs his ryder against ^he trees and walls, and through
hedges, ^o spoil him if it be possible: and when ^^e is down gives him a
farewell with ^^s heels. As for the Mule she is well y^ough known to be a
froward and vn^^ly beast; so that if her keeper watch her ^ot the better, she
will take him up in her ^^eth; and lay him before her in the man^er. The Prophet
therefore poynteth ^^rth this sin of frowardness, under ^^e Images of an
Horse and Mule, to note unto us, that there is nothing so brutish ^s to
reject, the doctrine and government which God has appointed for our souls:
whereof although there be many Judges, yet none can tell so well, what a
trouble-some piece of work this is, a^ the faithful ministers of the Gospel,
which are driven to manage such res^^ and untamed jades, as ar many amongs^
the multitude, for what with yerking ou^ the heels, rising upon the hinder
legs, g^ing side-long; and other froward touche^ of unbroken coltes; the poor
Minister if he be on their backs, can hardly keep the saddle; and if he lead
them in hi^ hand, on froward jade or other in the Parish, takes him up by
the collar, an^ throws him out of the way; so that (...) a man be never so
honest, and have many good friends; yet if he will do h^^ duty, he shall
hardly be able to stand^ without suspention or deprivation, o^ some such like
foyl; which would neue^ come to pass, if it were not for the H^^ses and Mules
in his Parish: and this (...) the cause, why many give over the^ good
beginnings in their ministry, because their people are so tickle heeled:
(...), and thus it comes about, that the Land is full of shiuen jades, which
can ^euer be broken of their unhappy pro^erties, because they were marred in
the ^andling at the first. Let us then learn ^ot to mislike or condemn the
diligence of good Pastors; notwithstan^ing the example of ten thousand which
are negligent: For the Scripture says, that they are not busybodies in so
^^ing, but we are Horses and Mules in dis^beying; as indeed it is evident
enough, ^ow sauagely and furiously many behave themselves, in rejecting the
nurture of the Gospel; which other-wise, before the Devil was interrupted in
them, had the commendation of civil men, of court^^e, and courteous
Gentlemen: The precepts of civility, and the rules (as they call them) of
vrbanitie, do teach a man ^o avoyde what-so ever is indecent and vnsightlie in
gesture or phrase, in look ^r gate; so that there are some to be found, so
exactly framed to these things, as if they had been cast in the very mould of
civil behavior. But alas, what profit is there in such matters, when men for
lack of christian education, notwithstanding their civility do disgrace and
discredit themselves so much, that when the Gospel is applied, such
forgetfulness of all good manners l^yeth hold on them, that they foam at the
mouth, and take on like wild Horses, that a man would wonder, what were become
of all their courteous demeanure, when they show their teeth for anger: and I
am persuaded, that many of them, who stand upon their own credites, if they
could see their faces in a glass, would hide their heads long after: yea,
there is no more sense nor wit, in such malecontentes, then in them which
kick the heel against a prick, as CHRIST told Saint PAVLL. This speaks
DAVID, to make disobedience an hateful thing unto us, because it transformeth
men unto brute beasts. He adds (I say) this argument, whose mouths with bit
and bridle thou must constrain, least they come near thee; showing, that as
Horses get nothing by their madness; but the so^er bit and bridle; no more do
stubborn persons get any thing by oppugning the Gospel, For they wrestle with
God, (as SAMVEL says) And indeed, when wicked men take on against Gods
word, they make themselves ridiculous, and wretched ridiculous; because they
bark at the Moon, and he which sits in the heavens, laugheth them to
scorn: Wretched, because they crush themselves, by running against this rock,
and are desperately bruised with this stone of offense; even as we see many of
them which are enemies to Gods word, with this bruise to spitte blood all
their life after; that is, to give evident tokens of a tormented conscience:
For there is nothing gotten by struggling under Gods hands; and therefore his
own children, when they become impatie^t of his incision, are bound to a
sourme. For it is certain, that Gods word cannot give place to men, and the
true minister of the Gospel, will not be repu^sed from his dutcy by Princes,
to the hurt of a good conscience; but the spiritual authority, in this
ministration shall be such, that it shall suffice. To bind even Kings with
chains, and noble with setters of Iron, (as some interpreth the place of the
Psalm) Wherefore, let us judge righteous judgment, thinking nothing to be
more ^onorable nor to be maistered by the word; and nothing to be more
prejudicial, then to show our selves wayward and from pole, in crossing and
resisting of the same.

And thus the comparison is finished in this verse; now the application of the
same follows in the next verse, in these words, Many sorrows shall come to
the wicked etc So that every thing being put in his place, it is to be
disposed in this manner: as Horses and Mules for their wildness, do bring
bittes and brydles upon themselves; so froward men, by their disobedience,
going on in their s^nnes, do heap sorrow on their own heads: which is also
declared by the contrary, in the other member of the verse. But he that
trusts in the Lord, mer^^^ shall compass him about. And in this application,
we must have an eye to the proposition of the Psalm, which (...) discoursed
of the sin of hypocri^i^, and how hardly men are brought (...) ^^e the true
remedies, that belong to the curing of an evil affected conscience; ^^^^rat
does he aim in this place also, ^^^^ming, that men shall get nothing by ^^^^ng
like wette Ecles out of Gods ^^ndes, but shall double their own ^^^uble, by
shifting and cloaking ma^^^ers, when they have to do with God: For there is no
mischief like to this, when men finding themselves discontented with the
straightness of the gate of grace, cast about to find other easier ways,
imagining that a man may do well enough, though he lay no such imposition
upon himself, as the strict doctrine of repentance does require: For although
the vanity of man's devises be evident in many things, yet it appears in
nothing so hurtefull, as when men think they can find another way of
salvation, then that which is sanctified by Gods word; yea, this is wicked
folly, which has cast men in diverse calamities, which think that they have
a reach beyond the Moon, both to suck still of the breasts of
voluptuousness, and yet to nourish the hope of salvation in them selves: while
men strain their wits, to bring things to these terms, they bring the
whole matter out of the sockat, and disturb their own consciences, with much
disquietnes; and a great deal more heart-byting, than they which never look
after salvation at all, by reason that they strive to bring two ends together,
that will never meet. And to this purpose, they reject what-so-euer is sharper
then aggreeth with their humor as over precise, and when they are taken in the
^ette with struggling to get out, they entangle themselves more and more, by
persisting in stubbornes, they bring many troubles upon themselves, until at
the last they dye for very anger, like Weesels that are taken in a trap.
Hereof King SAVLL is an ensample, who was ready to have used many shifts by
Witchcraft and other odd means, when he was vexed with an evil conscience:
But all his shifts tended to no other end (as things fell out,) but multiplied
his calamities and griefs, though ^he propounded comfort to himself. And so it
is with all wicked men, to whom ^^t any adversity happen, their conscience
can make no construction, that it is Gods loving visitation, but his very curse
upon them, and he crosses them in all their actions, feeding them with anguish
and confusion, as it were with bread, which play the hypocrites before him, and
distrust his gentleness i^ they should submit themselves to him without any
condition: yea, the Lords eggernesse against such men, is marueilouslie
described in the Scriptures, Th^^ he will make his darts drunk with bl^^d,
that he will spend all his arrows upon them, that he will be so hot in the
persute of them, that he will not so much as bayte in the (...), but drink of
the water of the brook, as we may see in his horrible judgments upon
Egypt: Who hampered PHA^^^ and his people? never leaving them to long as he
could find them warme^ For assuredly, as it is his first delight to do well to
his Israel; so the very next is, to glorify himself in his justice, by
multiplying the sorrows of the wicked, whereas on the contrary part it
follows. Those that trust in the Lord, mercy s^^l compass them about, etc.
That is, they give themselves into Gods hands, by ^^nfayned confession,
keeping nothing ^^ek, but standing contented to abide ^i^ awarde whatsoever,
because of the ^^dly trust they repose in him, their ex^ecration shall fail
them no whit: For ^he Lord shall so gird them round about ^^th his mercies, and
the sense of his fa^^^r, that no terror shall assail them, ^ut for the
multiplying of their comfort in the end. And all the difficulties shall be so
clean removed, that they shall find the yoke sweet and easy for them, which
galleth the neck of the im^^tient dissemblers: for when God is ^^^^d he sets
store of his credit, and ^^th more for them that believe him: (...) ever they
expected, so that they ^^me to be in a dream rather then to ^e possessed
indeed with such blessings, ^^e greatness and abundance of them ^^^o incredible
as in the Psalm. 26.4.

11 Be glad ye righteous, and rejoice in ^^e Lord: and be joyful all ye that
be upright in heart.
The last verse contains the efe^^ of the free grace and mercy of Go^ wh^^
it is felt in the h^rt, that it is a swee^ peace and unspeakable joy of
con^^^ence, to the fruitione whereof he exhorts just and sincere men, where by
w^^ are taught, that the end of Godly l^bours, and of the trauells of a
penite^^ soul, is as comfortable as the end o^ SARAHS travel, when she was
delivere^ of ISA^ the son of promise (the child of old age) and the hope of
all the who^^ world. For so it shall come to pass wit^ them that faint not
that they shall no^ be able to contain the spiritual joy^^ and comfortes
which shall rain upon them in a sweet shower from heau^^ howbeit their joy
is here limited, th^^ they should rejoice in the Lord, which must not be
counted any imparing o^ joys in Gods children, but an holy c^^rection, for
want whereof they mig^^ possibly stretche forth their hand wi^^ the wicked, and
reap unto themselves (...) Image of joye in stead of true by ^^e^te: for that
is the property of vn^^ly men, to r^moue the discomforts (...) their heart, by
worldly delectations, ^s S^^ called for Music when he (...) t^oubled with an
^uill Spirit, and ^o this purpose (men that be affrayed of ^^paire, and love
not to be humbled under the mighty hand of God) do use their wifes, their
friends, their meat and their drink, with all the pastime that can ^e devised,
to rejoice themselves with^ll, that they might put themselves out ^f the dompes
(as they call it) But in such ^ases none of these evils come upon ^^e head of
the righteous, but he refu^eth all worldly solace, and will not be ^o^
^^^ted, til he have found the joy of conscience, that he may rejoice in the
Lord for this is a sure joy as CHRIST ^ayeth, that no man can take away: which
^s not so spoken, as if a man might not ^aue a joyful use of Gods temporal
blessings; as of wife, of children, o^ friends and posterity, (and such
things) but rather to teach us how to rejoyc^ rightly in thos^ things,
considering tha^ there can be no harmony, where the chiefest string of the
instrument is mi^sing, which is a good conscience, which refers all things
to God, and thinks there can be no safe use of the^^ things, but under the
shaddowe of hi^ wings. Those therefore that think tha^ godliness is not fit for
all things, for al^ times and places; but to be reserved to^^ some special
devotions, as if it were unseasonable and indiscreet to mentio^^ it in the
middle of their pastimes an^ delights, seem to be better acquainted with the
sacrifices of the Indians the^ with true godliness: for let us assure o^^
selves, when we despise to have o^^ sp^rtes s^nctified as well as our serious
matte^^, we are playfellowes with the devil, who supplieth the ro^ne where
godliness is expelled, but joys thus seasoned, have no release in the mouths
^^ ^nbridled and untamed persons, who ^ink it a dead world if unchaste
daun^^s, ^uffenly speeches, and other scur^^litie be restrained, at feasts and
ma^^ges, and other merry meetings: Yea, ^any old people will say, that there
is ^^o setting of old men's heads on young ^^ns shoulders, being as it were
patrons ^f the unbridled wantonness of youth, ^hen they rejoice altogether
without ^he Lord. The son which hangs ^he head, and looks like a sheep
in ^esence of his father, bewrays a dis^^yall, and servile nature; and he
which ^noweth not how to be chereful, and to ^^epe his countenance amongst his
bet^^rs: will pass all bounds of modest ^^irth and honesty amongst his
equalles; and so fares it with them which can^^t be merry, and wise in the
Lord, which had rather be silent, then b^e ^ounde to the Law of grace,
which ^aue no certain course except their dissolute byas be observed. These
m^^ (I say) bewraie a slavish nature, becau^^ they cannot tell how to be
mer^^e along as God is by them: I mean an^ godly restraynt, that the
land-marke o^ virtue may not be removed; and vndo^^tedly, as it is seen in
this thing, so it is i^^ the weightest business of the consc^^ence, for when
Gods peace is not upon it, all the jestes in the world cannon move a man to
laughte^, but from the teeth outward: except the heart be ha^^dened, (which is
an horrible thing t^^ speak off) for himself is the substanc^ of our joy,
and these worldly delectat^^ons are but circumstances; in him alon^ may we
rejoice though they all fail but without him they are all comfort^ble as much
as salt is for sore eyes. Fu^^thermore, this exhortatione to appr^hend
spiritual joye, is directed to just (...) sincere men: that is, to those that
ha^^ set up justice as a mark to shoot at, an^ have decreed to hold in the
path of si^^^rity, though they be far from any me^torious righteousness, so that
this sen^^nce does not allow the justice of men, ^^t does as it were the
Cherubin by the ^^ee of life keep away with Gods sword; ^^ose that love
unrighteousness and are ^^e hearted, that they should not stretch ^^rth their
hands to gather the blessed ^^ite of this joye: for it is sure enough, ^^at
there are many as S. PAVL says, ^^at rejoice in the face, which rejoice ^^t
in the heart, nether shall they be able (...) get down any comfort, so long as
^^ey love sin more then God: no, al^^ough all the parts of their life be
a^^rned with such moralities, and out^^rd works, as appear not in many of ^ods
dear children: for the works are ^^t the adjunctes of faith, but the love ^^d
sincerity of works, for faith will ^^vne her self to nothing, which can be
(...) a Reprobate. And as hope and Faith ^^e not of things visible, no more is
the ^^^ishment of hope and faith by works apparent, but the Lord loves th^^
plain meaning soul, and fills bo^^ the hands thereof with comfort, fro^^
whence springs the vnspeake-ab^^ riches of faith, and of hope; and the^^fore
the scriptures makes the heart th^^ seat of sincerity, and not the brayn^^
because the heart is the house of the a^fections, and the brain the seat o^^
Judgment: For IVDAS knew CHRIST his blood to be innocent, but his hear^ was
cruelly affected to his master. L^^ us therefore bend our selves to strive
a^^ter since^^ty and uprightness, that w^^ may he gladded with the spirit of
adoption; and that we may rejoice not in the flesh, but in the Lord.

FINIS.
