CVM PRIVILEGIO.

TO THE BENEVOlent Reader.
ALL the writtinges of those quha defendes ane evil cause, as dois Schir Ioh^e
knox, vsis (...) be siufit, for inla^k of better garniment, with schoring and
hedinfull saingis, lies, wi^h words (...) pa^nt^t and coloret, als convenient
to begyle the simple readar, as to impesche and travel men of good ingyne, and
midway knawlage, to cum to the understanding of the verity: suay that be the
spreit of discretione they may discern betuix treu^h and falset. And thairfoir
in the luill discurs I have maid for ansuer to knox buke, writtin aganis ane
letter of mine send to my vnqulyle Brother five zearis passit or thairby: I
have put aside and omittit all thing that appertenis noch^ propirlie to the
cause, and with als gryte simplicity as I culd, with help of God^s grace,
ansuerit: without any boutgaitt or subterfuge from the matter, that is betuix w^
in debait, alwais, with sic stre^th of reasone as thou good reader sall think
suffi^ie^t to put at under the evil fou^det fortres my aduersar hes builded
agauis the verity.

Nocht witstanding beresson their is within his buke and dytment sum things
nocht meakle appertenand to the cause, worthy alwais of reprehensione, I thocht
good to tuiche sum of them, to the effect, that the rest of his followars,
disciples, or marrowes, learn to be sumpart moderat, and mair circumspect in
their writting, and nocht to esteem ws [albeid we be vtherwa is simple and
negligent] to be so destitute of judgment and commone intelligence, that we can
nocht perceive, quhat difference their be betuix the simple and stre^th^^
defense of ane iustcaus, and the crafty coloring of ane lesing

Be this I may h^ip in God, that sum reading this my censure of the adurrsa^s
writting may perchance learn sumthing, qu^isk of^^ sorr, other they misknew, or
tha^ had (...) they had known it and other be learni^g or (...) also to the
knaulage of their (...) God his spous the halie Catholic and (...), and their
awin salvation. Now good (...) proposit ged willing saschorlie, that I (...),
and sa modes^lie, that nane of the (...) quhow ^ffectionatlie that ever they
embrace his doc^rine, sall have just occasion to be co^^^^uit be any asperitie
of wordis I sall vs^. And to begin (...) the beginning of his buke, quhair of
his accustomis modes^ie, he dois call me ane fule in their wordis. ansuer nocht
ane fule according to his folishenes. Corint. 3.
To the quhilk iniure and contumely I say no thing bot that, quhilk says the
Apostole S. Paull, he that is wise ama^gis z^w lat him becum anefole, that he
may be ane wise man in did: that is, quha estemis him self wise, he man afoir
he becum wise in did esteem him self a fool, euin be resso^ of the estimatione
he hes of his awin wisdone. Suato the effect I may be participant of the t^ew
wisdone, q^hair of the Apostle meanis, I nocht only heir with patience Schir
Iohne k^^x call me ane fool, bot alsuay inwartlie in my heart and conscience,
knawis my self to be ane fool: have and na matter to gloir in* any wisdom that
I have of my self: bot that I am ane of the weak membris of lesus Christ,
participant be his grace, after the measure of my capacity of sic wisdom, as
he hes teachit his may deirlie belouit spous the halie catholic and
Apostolic kirk, be the continual assiste^ce of his halie spreit according to
his promis. After wart he declaris the cause that monit him to wreit aganis my
letter in thais wordis: To quiet thairfore my conscience, when God gaif me to
considder, that quh^soeuer opponis nocht them selves to manifest lies,
differris little from tratoures, I did put my hand to the pen. we have good cause
to dout at the best gif God be the author and wirkar of any sic
co^sid^ration^s, or ^hochtes, as knox mind hes been occupeit with this money
zearis past* lest be God we understand the God of this world, 2. Cor. 4.
quha be the ministry of Schir Iohne knox and his aco^plesis dois wirk in the
sonis infidelity. Zet dout we nocht, bot the very true God, (quha nocht only
is the author and induellar of all good minds, bot also dressis and puttis in
ordour evil minds be his providence, to the proffiet of his chosin) has
permitted his malice to interprise this ansuer, that thairby his folly micht be
maid manifest: and money be that way reterit out of the mirknes they war drawin
into be him. Ester wart being obstinatlie addicted to his awin oniust and
ungodly practeise dois fall in may despytfull and skla^derous reproaches
ealling our doctrine blasphemies and lies, quhair it is gret^^^lie to be
lame^tit, that the hartis of me^ should be so blindet with utter and extreme
darkness, and so separat from the grace of god, that they should nocht anis espy
the abominable inue^tionis, and dessaitfull practices of thais personis colorit
and setfurth be sic vtragius ad dispytfull sklandres. And albeid no wise or
godly man will gi^eares to sic vane reproaches: zit understanding sindrie to be
oftymes moved thairly I will exhort them to considder diligently, the discurs
of our disputatione, quhair they sall cleirlie understand, that it proceid
rather of his custom and deprauat consuetud, nor of any reason: as alsuay they
sall onderstand it to ^um of ane mair arroga^t and presumptious breast, sterit
up to that effect be Satan, as cleirlie may appeir of his style, quhilk he
dois usurp to him self in thais word^. Iohne knox the seruand of Jesus Christ
desyris grace mercy and pace from God the father of our loird Jesus christ.
Fane wald he appe^r to the simple people, that he seducis, S. Petir or S,
P^^ul, or at the l^^st ane man of Apostolic life and verteu: clething him self
with their phrasis, manner of spe^king, and wordis, eu^n as the Ass of Cumis
quha beand an is fled fra his masters service did cleith him self with the
skin of ane lyo^ that he micht l^ue at liberty, and nocht to be drawin agane
to the zok of his master. Bot e^in, as that Ass, being with diligence
cleirlie espyet be his la^g luggis, was knawin to be ane ass cled with ane
lions skin: suay quha will ^spy diligently Schir I^hne knox actionis, and
behavior, euin sen he begouth to be principal pillar of his new buildet kirk
in Scotland, sall casalie persaue als greit difference to be betuix the spreit
of Schir Iohne knox and the spreit of S. Petir or S. Paul, or any other
Apostle, as is betuix ane Ass and anelyon, or to use the similitude mair
propre to our propois) as is betuix ane wolf and ane true pastor. Quhairfoir
I bes^ik the good reader to call to rememberance the admonitioun of our
Maistre Christ, Mas^h. 7.
saing. Be war with them that eumis to zo^ in seheip skinnis, for they ar in
wartlie wolfes. And that his Apostle sayis falls prophetis ar subtle war km^n,
and transformes them selves in persons of the Apostles of Christ. Quhilk is
no thing marvelous, 2. Cor. 2.
in ^espect that Satan transformes him self into ane angel of ^cht For gif
evil appears without any apperance of good, their is no man, bot incontinent
wald refuse it, euin as all men abhorris ane evil spreit without he be covered
with the form of ane angel. And thairfoir, euin as Satan him self, quhen he
will deceane, apperis nocht in his awin form, bot in the form other of ane
good angel, or than of sum-man of authority: euin in lyk naner, fall,
prophetis, heretikis, and s^ducears of the people quhilk is ar the ministers of
satan, apperis never in thur awin liknes nor similitude, bot couer^d with the
scriptures in their words and speaking, or sum other externe liknes of the
Apostolis, and true seruandis of God. And as every ane of them is the m^ir
wicked or author of ane doctrine may far from the verity: suay is he in his
behalf mair crafty to cover him self with sic ane mantill, and thairby may
impudent to vsurp it, that nawa is appertenis to him. we know weill, that the
Apostolis, espetialie S. Petir and Paul vsit sic titles, but for certane
causes, and of good richt: lyk alsuay as after their days sum doctors of the
Catholic kirk, bot with greit humility and modesty, and verray seindill, suay
that in S. Augustenis epistolis Aug. contr^ Epist. Fundamenti.
it is never found bot anis. And the Papis callis them bot seruand^s of the
serua^dis of God. Be the co^trar all heretikis almaist of all times hes vsur
ped impudentlie the titles of the Aposteles, Suay did Manes (as testefies S.
Augusten) author and beginner of the Manicheans superstitioun, suay hes done
all the false doctouris of our days. Heirfoir good Reader (...) the, for the
affection, and zeall thou hes to thy awin salvation, quhair euir thou sall heir
or read sic vantouris, nocht to trow hastclie, that thairb^e other t^ay be lion
or scheip, quhobeit they wear their skins: for in verity it is great
barnelines to be sa hastelse seducit and begylit, especiallic in ane matter of
sa greit importance, ^. Cor. 14.
And the Apostle deith admonis ws to be barnes in malice, bot nocht in wit. To
this he^d apperteanis also, quhilk he writtis, that his followars of Edinburgh
sufferit litill les calamitre for his departing, tha^ did the faithful after
the persecutioune of S. Stephan. For wnto he prove that he defendes that same
cause, quhilk S. Stephan did def^nd and tholit deith for, he will never cause me
to believe nor grant, that other his followars of Edinburgh be lyk the faithful
of H^erus^lem, or their calamities, quhilk they s^ste^^^ throch his doparting,
lyk to the afflicti^n of the faithful of Jerusalem after the death of
Stephan. Zit dois he mocht stand in any way content, h^ueand cled and
habilzicth him self with the man^ell of the Apostles, and haueand also comparit
his affliction and persecusion to the persecution of S. Stephane: onles
moreeuer he declair him self indewed with the spreit of prophe^re in their
words. The Roman Antochrist salbe destro yet in dispyte of all thois yat
labor in the co^trare In the quhilk he dois follow the futstoppis of his
forfather Martin luther, quha afoir his death desired this verse to be put on
his greaf. Pestis eram viuus, moriens tua mors ero Papa. In verity he was ane
pest quhen he leuit, nocht only because he said suay, bot because it was suay in
did be all mennis judgment that knew him weill: suay it was nothing difficill
to him to spe^k prophecy of that quhilk was passtt in the sich^ of all men,
bot quhen he com to sch^w the thing that was to cum, the spreit of prophecy
falit him. For, quhat ever the Devil be the ministr^e of Li^ther persuadit to
the cuntray of Almani^ in his life, it hes had bot litill succes after his
death, suay that their is few cuntrais presently in Alman^e, quhilkis retenis
nocht in sum part the Catholic* eligioun, quhilk the kirk of Rome professis,
and ane greit part of them quha was seduc^d be him, hes verray greit desire to
return to the Catholic kirk, alhe^^ they be impesch^t be warldlie
impedimentis allu^erlie contrar to the true faith and ^eligio^n according to
the word of Christ, quhilk he spak lang ^yme ago. Johan. 5.
Quomodo potestis credere qui gloriam queritis abinuicem. Suay we may ho^p tha^
this prophecte of Sr. Iohne knox, sall cum to the same effect be schort process
of time.

As concerning his form and manner of ansuering, quhilk ^e uses in all his
discurs, I may assure the in feu words, that he never ansueris to that quhilk
was demandit of him: bot ever seikand refugis and bygets, castis in money other
matters by it quhilk is in question, to distrack the readars intentioun and
spreit, that he never perceive it quhilk is in controversy, nor quhous laulie
he ansuer is thairto. Moirower, agains all law of good resoning, he dois ever
bring for probatioun that quhilk is in qurstione as quhair he will prove that
he hes the true kirk, he vsis this ordinalie for ane probation. We haif the
true kirk, says he, because We ar assurit to be mantenit be God, and that We
ar gadderit in his name. Now all man may se, that the question betuix him and
ws is, quhether they be gadderit and mantenit be God or no^ht. In (...) manner,
quhou often that ever he callis the Pape. the Roman Antechrist, or the Mess
Idolatry, he fallis almaist in the like falt, to vsurp that as certan, quhilk
of it self is ma^stfals, and repugnant to all verity, And as concerning the
present disputatione, at the l^st, in controversy. To his vanity appertenis
also, that he execr^tis and condamnis his aduersaris with ma^st horribill
ex^crationis bosting the wraith of Gog to cum on them, ^nles that hastily
they return to repentance of sic thing^s, to the quhilkis (as the discourse of
his letter (...)) he can nocht ansuer. Gif he wald hane had any crede^t or
authority, he should have first ansueri^ sufficiently to all things, quhilkes
was obiectit ag^nis his doctrine: and thairefter he micht have had sum just
occasion to call his aduersar ane liar and an^ blasphemour. Bot onmyndfull of
his awin dewtie, he can nocht for zet his accustomat modesty to blaspheme and
execrat, quhasoeuer opponis them to his new inuentis eu^ngell. As quhair he
reproaches my language and orthographie, I wald require sum judgment and
circumspectione of him and his ministers in that behalf, for quhow impropir
that ever my language be I am verray excusabill, be resson of my lang absence
from my awin cuntray and hanting of the latin tongue and other languagis mair
nor my awin. Alwais God willing, I sall spe^k (...), that I salbe easalie
understand. Aug: lib. 5. conf. c. 6.
I reid in S. Augustein* that a mannis language, is lyk unto ane plait, or ane
other eschall ^^d the matter that he (...) to be understand (...) his language,
is lyk ^he meat that is proponit in ^he plait: and euin [s^is he] is ane
hungry man, will li^ll regard of quhat matter the plait be, or quhether it be

that is proponit: sua a man that ^es desire to feid his spreit with the
weritie, will litill ^egarde the manner of the language, he the quhilk the

The letter.
SChir after hartlie commendatione of service and prayars I have writtin sa often
afoir (we keip his awin wordis and orthographie) it come of my cheritie, that I
aucht to zow for sindrie ressonis, and of the solicitude that cheritie causit
me to have of the eternal salvation of zour saul desyrand be zour ansuer to
haif knawin zour mind in that behalf quhilk sen I have nocht obteni^ as zit I
haif thoche haueand opportunity of this bearer to wreit this writting amanges
the rest and to exhort zowthairbie that Ze wald ernistlie (as it becummis ane
man to quhome god hes geuin sa money giftis and talentis) and ryplie co^sidder
be quhat way ze man cum to that end to the quhilk god hes creatit and redemit
zow.

SCHIR IOHNE k^ox ansuer.
TO this lang preface we only ansuer this that gif the scribes and Pharisees
who compas^ed sea and land to make a proselyt gat a curse be the mouth of our
master Jesus Christ notwithstanding all their appeira^d zeal and panefull
travel who can dout bot that sic as study to draw back agane to superstitioun
and I do latrie sic as god hes callet from the same shall receive a double
maledictioun under what pretense that ever they do it. For gif they who brought
ethnickis and manifest Ialolatouris to sum religioun war accursed whou much
moir ar they detestable that travel to bring men from a true religioun to the
deapest Idolatry that ever yet was upon the face of the erath? (...) this
^sphomie ^aibe after ^art ansue^
which long hes been manteynet in the Papisticall kirk whereto we persaue the
wryttar of the letter would entise Zou, as his subsequent persuasiouns
manifestly declaireth. For thus he writes.

THE REFVTATIOVN.
I kn^w that was said to the scribis and pharisees, woe be unto zou that dois
compass sea and land to make zou ane proselyt, that is, to cause any man change
his sec or religioun. It is Ze quha hes compassett beath sea and land to draw
men from the tree wreligioun and worscheping of god. As to ws, we de^yre na man
to change his religioun, bot be the contrar we exhort to perscueir in that
faith and religioun quhilk every ane promiset to God in his baptism. It is ze
thairfoir quha dois incur that curs and maledictioun of our salueoure, as zour
master throuch inwye causes Adame our first parent be eiected from Paradise.
Suay ze following as zit zour fatheris futstoppis, do travel nicht and day
according to Zour pouuer to seduce all man from the unity of the true and
Catholict kirk quhilk is Paradise in earth nocht content os zour awin fall ze
entyse wtheris to followz ou, to that effect that ze apeir nocht to perise zour
alanc.

THE LETTER.
QVhilk apperis to me, to be the only faith and religioun, hepith in the
Catholic kirk of Christ, sen the beginning thairof, Quhilk apperis cleirlie be
the may plane words of the proph^t Isaie, quhair he spekis of the kirk. Gens
and regnum quod nonseruierittibi peribit. Quhilk words gif any wald apply to
their new found kirkes and specially to zour invisible kirk of scotland bot
zit aucht zeir auld he is convicted. For it is manifest that befoir a thousand
zeires in all the world was their people of God that trowit as thai do, quha
defendis the contrar^e, quhilk na man bot he that wald schaw his impudency and
his ignorance to gidder dar deny: and of the kirk, quhair of the propheit
spekis, It is said be him in the second chap. that it sall be manifest and
visible throw all the world. Quhairfoir gif ze ca^ nocht schaw quhat place of
the world afoir three hundredth zeir zour kirk was into, it followis of
necessity that it isna kirk.

SCHIR IOSHNE KNOX ANSVER.
THe first part of his counsall we aproue and add thairto that the life
everlasting consistes in the knowledge of him whom he has send Jesus Christ.
That he that beleuis in the sone of god hes life everlasting, and is all ready
past from deith to life, bot he that beleuis nocht sell nocht se life: but the
wraith of god aby dis upon him. we further affirm that without the sociecie
and bo some of the true kirk, never was, is, nor salbe saluatiou^ unto man. In
their and like general heidis we disagre nocht from the Papistis, but the
diference and dout standis in the specialis, to wit, quhat faith is, and what
ground it hes, what is religioun, and wherein it differis from superstit^oun,
and from I dololatrie. And finally what is the true kirk, and whou it may be
decerned from the sinagoge of Satan. Their heads we say onght he in special to
haif intreted wnto zou if he had been minded to have instructed Zou in a
treuth* But because (as the progres of his letter declares) his mind was to
draw you to ye boudage of that Roman Antechrist, he takes general
propositions most true, and most certane in them selves, whereupon he would
conclude that which is most falls and all together pernicious to the salauatioun
of man. Bot thet the craft of satan moir evidently appear, we shall draw his
persuasioun in form of argument, and after return to the farther meaning of
the Propheit, and to the declaratioun of their termis faith, religioun, and
catholic kirk* the Propheit affirms that whosoever sall nocht serve Jerusalem
shall perish.

Bot the promeis maid to Inrusalem, apertenis wnto the kirk, ergo whosoever
seruis nocht the kirk fall perisse. This hoil argument we admit, and most
constantly we do affirm it, and yet sall he never be able to prove his intent,
which is, that the kirk of scotland is no kirk we will oppin the wound which the
writer of the letter keapes couerit, and yet it most greuis him, as it does
the rest of all Papistis. The realm of scotland (all praise to god) hes
refused the Pape that Roman antechrist, and nocht only be preaching bot also
be the publict laws hes dampened his tyrannical lawis, his odious
superstitiouns and usurped iurisdictioun. And thairfoir cry the Papistis, that
we at declyned from the true kirk and ar f^llen back from the catholic faith.
But befoir that thai be able to convict ws of those crimes they monprei^ two
things, ^ormer, that whatseouer was promised to Jerusalem, dois properly and
only apertene wnto Rome, and this mon they do not be conjectures, but be plane
wordis as god prononced be his propheit of Jerusalem* this is the first. the
secound is, that albeit Rome war als able to prove a promise maid to it as
Jerusalem was of whom it was said this is my rest hear will I dwell. because I
have, chosin it, and albeit that the Papis of Rome whom he stylis the
perpetual successioun of that kirk, had as ane assured and plane probatioun,
that be god they wre called, be god they were admitted, and that be god they
sold be mantenyd in their ministry and functioun, as that the levites and
successioun of Aaron had to produce at all times for their defense, yet if they
(we say) who call them selves the successouris of the Apostlis be nocht able
to proueihat thai haif constantly remaned in the first league and conuenant
which christ Jesus maid with his Apostolis when he send them forth to preach
the glaid tydingis of the kingdom, and to establish his throne, not only
among the Iewis, bot also among the gentiles, according to the former
propheseis. Albeid we say that all their former thai were able to prove (as thai
ar never able to do) yet have they said no thing that may help their cause, not
hurt ouris, onles that they thairwith planely prove that the kirk of Rome and
the successioun of the same hes remanit, and yet remaneth in the original
pu^itie of the Apostils in doctrine, life, laws and ceremoneis. For their being
corrupted the tytill of successioun will na mair help them the^ did the
braging of the preistis wnder ye law, who cryit aganis the propheit leremie,
the temple of the lord, te temple of the lord the temple of the lord* what was
answeret wn to them, let the.7. chap. of his prophecy witness Butfarther of the
assurance theirof, after. Now mon we sumthing speak of faith, religioun and
catholic kirk wherewith he would terrify yowr conscience, and deface the
truth, Ierem 7.
and then mon we auswer to his bleaspheamous tauntis and mockage, befoir we
ha^f confessit that to leave without faith, without religioun, and vithout the
society of the catholic kirk, bringis with it most cettanely death and
damnatioun. But yet we affirm that al opinioun that is commonly received wnder
the name of faith is nocht faith whilk god aprouis, bot true faith mon have for
the ground and assurance theirof godis expressed word, of his mercy promised in
christ Jesus, where to the heart of the faith full mon consent so moved be the
haly gaist. And thairfoir we fear not to affirm that the Papistis having no
better ground for their faith, then consent of men, decreis of counsals, and
antiquity of time, ha^f no faith, bot a fond, yea* a damnable opinion. And the
same we affirm of religioun which if it be pleasing and acceptable wnto God,
must have his awin commandment, and approbatioun for a warrant: otherwais it
can nocht be bot odious in his presence, as a thing repugning to his expres
commandment: saying, not that which appearis Good in thy awin eyis sall thou
do to the lord thy God, bot what the lord thy God hes commanded the, that do
thou, ade nothing to it, diminishe nothing from it. Be this precept of that
eternal God who is immutable, and that can command nothing but that which is
just, a^ all pl^ple, realms, and natiounis (that will auow theme selves to be
the inheritance of the lord) bound and oblist to measure their religioun, not
be the exemple of other realms, nather yet be their owen good intentioun; or
determinatioun of men, but only be the expressed word of God. So that what
theirein is commanded aucht to bedone, and what is not commanded be him, aucht
in na wise to be done be the people of God, what apperance or external shaw of
holiness that ever it hes. And thairfoir have we most justly rejected the rabble
of ceremoneis which the Papistis held for the chief exercise of their
religioun, as thingis having na better ground then the invention and consent of
men. Now shortly of the kirk communlie callit catholic. The name of the kirk
is commun and is taken as weil for the congregatione of the wicked as for the
assemble of the godly, as it is plane be the words of David sayng: I have
hatet the kirk, ^hal. 26.
or the assemble of the wicked, the term Catholic, which signifyes universal,
heth not included in it that vertew which Papistis allege, that is, that
whatsoever is Catholic that most be good. For if so were than sin in the
original world should have been good* for it was so catholic (that is
universal) that it ouerfloued the hole earth only on house excepted. whou
universal Idolatry was amongis the Gentiles, histories witness, and whou
braid the pestilent sect of Machomet is this day spread, experience dois teich
ws. And yet we suppone that no man of right judgment will aither approve the
one or the other, notwithstanding of their universality, and thairfoir we must
have a better assurance of the kirk, to the which we aucht to join our selfis
then that it is catholic or universal, to wit it must be holy and the
communioun of sainctis. For in the confessioun of our faith, we say not I
believe the kirk universal, bot I belief the holy kirk universal, the
communioun of fanctis. wherfoir we affirm, that if that kirk which is called
catholic or universal, have not holiness in the heart be true faith, Or the
harpan.
and the confessioun of the same in the mouth, and in the foirheid it ceissis
to be the immaculate spous of Jesus Christ, in whose bosom the sons of God
at nurished to the life everlasting. And so befoir that the writer of the
letter shall be able to convict ws, that we have declyned from the holy kirk,
he must first defyne what is the verray holiness of the kirk, wherein it
consistis, fra whom it flowis, and what is the effect of the same. And when
thus he hes done, he must prove yat the kirk of Rome hes been and is only holy,
so that no kirk befoir it did ever enjoy that tytill, nether yet that any that
after may ensew it, may sa be justly callit, and thus we think shall be werray
hard to Master Tyrie and all the Jesuits in Europe to prove.

THE REFVTATION.
ALl this discurs is sa vane and sa litill to the propos, that I was nocht
weill at quhat pair I should begin. First he sais, that of tuay propositiones
quhilkis ar verray true, I collect ane conclusione may falls and repugnant to
all verity. Ane Dialectitian wald ansuer, that schir Iohne knox hes nocht
weill considderit the rewlis of Dialectik, to affirm ane falls conclusion to
follow of true premissis. Bot because I know his greit occupationis and
solicitude he hes of his wife and childrine, that he culd nocht tack tent to
sic trifflis I will pas this with silence, and tak tent^to sic trifflis I will.
pas this with silence and will enter schortlie in the matter. He domandis ws two
thingis, gif we wald establiss the Roman kirk to be the true kirk. The first
is that we schaw quhat sumeuer was promised to Jerusalem to appertien only to
the Roman kirk: I ansuer that the promeis appertenis to ane kirk quhilk should
be catholic or universal: lyk as we say I believe the halie catholic kirk:
suay gif na kirk or congregatioun of men quha professis the name of Christ at
all time hes been Catholic, nor zit is Catholic except the Roman kirk
(quhilk dois nocht only comprehend the town of Rome bot alsuay the haill
world, quhilk in unity of doctrine dois aggre with it) it followis
necessarlie, that quhatsumeuer was promised to ^erusalem, dois only appertene
to the Roman kirk. And this to zour first domand.

the secund domand is that albe^d the promeis be maid to the Roman kirk we
schaw mairour that it hes remanit in the first conuenant with our Saluiour.
This domand contenis in it ane may wicked blasphemy: for Schir Iohne knox
Supponis, that God micht promeis that quhilk he wald nocht accompleis, quhilk
is no thing else bot to make him ane liar. Thairfore it requiris na new ansuer,
because. the promeis of God is fer me and certane, that gif he hes promised to
mantene his kirk be the assistance of his holy spreit to the end of the world,
we aucht to be assured thairof quhatsumeuer Schir Iohne knox say: quhais
impudency and arrogance is so great in this behalf that he apperis mair
wicked, nor Satan him self his Master. Because albeid that the Roman kirk
have the promeis of God to be mantened, zet onles it prove that it hes been,
and is as zit mantenit, he will gif na credence nor authority thairto. And be
the contrar albeid he and his ministers be destitute of all promeis, zet he
will quhatsumeuer he says to be embraced as the true and sincere woird of God.
Gif his arrogance be greit, I leif the judgment to the reader. As to re place
of Hieremie the propheit quhilk Ze cite, it makis no thing for zour opinione,
bot reather is aganis Zow, because as the text schawis manifestly, he spak
nocht only to the preistes bot to the haill multitude, quhome he accusis that
they had may enormlie transgressit the commandimentis of God, bot because the
people vsit to object to the prophetis quhen thai were admonised be them that
thai had the temple of the lord, euin as thairbie thai had been in greit
security, and na evil culd befall wnto them. Hierrmie dois reject sic
obiectionis, sayand that sic vane persuasionis will no wais auale them onles
be sincere and onfenzed repentance thai turn wnto God, and leave accordingly
to his law. He denied nocht ^s ze affirm that they had the true kirk of God
and that God was treulie worsehepit in the synagoge, bot admonised the people
to gloir nocht in that as that thairthrowonlie thai micht pleis God lyk as we
say now that it will nocht be proffitable to ws that we have the true kirk and
the true doctirne, onles our life and manners correspond thairto. Bot lat ws pas
fordward.

Ane argument quhilk uset ever to be objected be Catholic men aganis Zour new
invented kirk is this, The true kirk of God aucht ever to be catholic or
universal: Zour kirk hes nocht ever been universal: thairfore it can nocht be
the true kirk of God. Zeansuer, that quhatsumeuer is vninersall is nocht
consequently good, as Ze deduce be money exemples. Quhilk ansuer as every man
may sie is naway to the propos Because albeit it were granted to Zow that it war
nocht sufficient to the true kirk to be universal, zit ze can nocht deny bot
it is necessare. I hairfoir gif ze head ansuerit to the propois, ze should haiue
schawin zour kirk to have been universal at all time. Bot apperandlie
convicted be zour conscience, and be experience it self ze confess all radie
the contrar: and thairfoir reiectand that mark, quhilk of it self is may
evident, and approuit be all scriptures, ze seik refuge to ane other mark,
quhilk is far mair obscure, and onknawin, quhilk is, that the true kirk of God
aucht to be halie, For the halines of the kirk is only knauwin to him quha
doith understand the secretis and heartis of me^, and thairdy being only
knauwin to God it can on naways be ane taikin to ws of the true kirk. Bot gif
ze wald affirm the halines of the kirk to confist in the dew and lauchfull
administratioun of the sacramentis and co^digne professione of the faith, as ze
appeir to allege* ze micht alsuay thairby perfytlie understand that it is in
Lykmaner obscuir and ane ondecydet controversy. For all heret^kes hes
continually unto this present hour usurped that as ane taikin and note for
approbatioun of their kirk. As to the notis and taikines of tho true kirk, they
should be sua appropriat to it, that they may nocht be vsurpet be falls propheites
be onie meanis, as that the kirk is universal, and that it hes continewall
successioun of pastoures: Quhilk tuay markis did never as zet aggrie to onie
assembly or congregatioun of heretics. Because that all heretics hes decayet
from the true kirk, suay their sinagoge at all time culd nocht be universal,
and be that same resson they culd never be albe to schaw contineuatioun of
their pastoures. Bot did ever gadder to them selfis ane ordour of ministeris
without onie lauchfull beginning, as testifeis. S. Augustine in his questionis
of the auld and new testament, saing, quhasoeuer has collected them selfis
ane seit nocht in tke kirk of God, we affirm it to be the cheir of pestilence.
In respect they do cummer and molest the ondouted ordour begun at Petir, and be
continual successioun of pastoures deducet unto this present hour making to
them selfs ane ordour without beginning, and ane body without ane head.
Quhairfoir in respect thais infallible and suir notes of the kirk of God can
nocht be no means corespond to zour sinagoge, it is may notoriouflie knawin
that ze and the remanant of zour propheites ar alluterlie separat from the true
kirk. zet pretermitta^d that of fifty sects quhilkis dois regne this day,
every ane of them dois attribuit to them self the rycht administratioun of
the sacramentis and the confessioun of faith, and beleues as ze do, that they
teache na thing bot the sinceir word of God. To preif that this mark dois on na
way conuein to zour kirk, for the present I will wse bot ane aryument, The
richt administratioun of ye sacramentis, and the confessioun of faith or only
notes of the visible kirk: zour kirk afoir Iohne calvin was invisible as ze
confess all reddie: Th^irfoir it culd nocht be knawin be the formar notes, and
consequently the kirk of God hes been destitute this money ku^dreth zeiris of
her may certane and infallible marks, quhilk is ane great blasphemy. As
quhain ze say that it wilbie verray hard to me and to all them quhome ze call
Iesuistis to preif that the Roman kirk only is halie, it is nawais hard bot
verray easy. Because that the halines of the kirk is suay co^tonet with the
forsaid no^es, that is, with the universality and lauchfull suceession of
pastouris that it can on na ways be separat. Thairfoir considdering that
amangis all congregationis quha does profes the name of Christ, thai only quha
dois adheir to the Roman kirk can be able to schaw sic successioun, with
universality it followis of necessity that ^rew halines do is only appertein
to them. And as Zour sinagoge is destitute of the formar notis, sua of
necessity it is destitute of all halines. Bot Schir Iohne knox to seduce the
semple people do is argument sua, as gif the halines of the kirk culd be
separat fra the universality thairof, and the lauchfull succession of
Paustouris: quhilk is may falls, erronius, and repugnant to all scriptures.
For the Apostoles did conione thais ^uay notes together, I belief the halie
catholic kirk. Because the kirk of God, as it is halie, sua it is caeholick or
universal, And onles Schir Iohne knox prove his kirk to be catholic, it is
impossible that it be halie.

THE REST OF SCHIR IOHNE knox ansuer.
BOt now that the vanity of his argument may the moir evidently appear, we
will in as few wordis as we can examine the mind of the propheit. Sic as
diligently markis the scope of the propheit Isaias, sais cleirlie, that from
the 40. chap. of his prophecy to the end of the same, he traueillis
principally to comfort Jerusalem, and the natioun of the lewis, whose miserable
distructioun and fearful captiuttie he foresaw in spreit. Pronunced the same
in his publict sermonis and left the memo^riall and on douted register their of
to the posterity, that was to follow and was to be partakeris of all the
plaigues that were befoir spoken? And least that they in the myddis of you
calamity should haif disparit of any delyuerance: from the same 40. chap back we
say that the propheit, as the messinger of Godis mercy pronounced to Jerusalem,
to mont syon and to the afflicted Iewis, delyuerance from captivity, the
protection of God, to be their defense, the destruction of Babylone and of all
their enemies the cumming of the Messiah promised wnto them, the felicity of
his kingdom the vocatione of the Gentiles, and finally the promyses flowing
from mercy that he had maid unto them to continue for ever. And among their
manyfold promysis this was one, the kingdom and the natioun that sall not
serve thee, sall perish. Now gla^dly wald we learn of the writer to what
realm, to what natione, to what province or city will he appoint ws, that
thairin we may serve Jesus Christ, and his immaculate spous the kirk: to the
end that we shall not perish, if he will name Rome and the kirk theirof, then
must we demand two things, the former. what become of all the faithful the
space of a thousand years that flowed betuix the making of the former
promyses, and the dayis of the Apostilis, what time the Euangell began
publictly to be offered wnto the Gentiles. All which time Rome was nothing bot
a den of Idolatry, we think he will nocht say that the faithful perished and
we are bauld to say that the faithful served not Rome nather yet the kirk
contenit thairin all that time, this is the first whereof we would be resolved.
The second is that if the writer will allege that during all the time the
promise foirsaid apperteaned to Jerusalem and wnto mont Syon: but that after
that the Euangell was received of the Gentiles the promise which befoir was
maid te Jerusalem was transfered wnto Rome. If so be, we pray the writer that
after he hes consulted with the fynest Papistis be they Jesuits, or be they
otheris that he will shaw wuto ws where we shall find the resign^tioun and the
asseurance theirof. we clearlie read the promis maid to Jerusalem and wnto most
syon. we find that the euangell was there preachet in dispyte of Satan. we
find that from thence Peter and I hone were send to samarea and therefter the
euangell was planted among the gentilles: we findfarher that Paul wrete to
the sanctes that were at Rome, and that he himself was caryet presoner to it and
that he remanit two years there under custody in his ludgeing: bot that ever
the promises maid to Jerusalem were transferred wnto Rome, we find not. And
therofoir albeit that we of the realm of scotland have refussed Rome, and the
tyranny thairof, we think not that we have refused the society of christis
kirk: but that we arioynit with it, and daily ar fed of our motheris
breasts, becans we embrace no other doctrine than that which, first flowed
forth of Jerusalem whois cietizenes be grace we awou our selves to be.

THE REFVTATIOVN.
This ansuer is sa litill to the propos that it nedis almaist na refutation.
zit to the effect he appeir nocht to gloir of his awin folischenes, I will
discus sumpart mair diligently quhatsumeuir he says. As to his first
propositioun that this promeis was made to Jerusalem or to mont Syon: gif he
vnderstandis be Jerusalem the Synagoge of ye Iewis, it is necessare that all
kingdom and natioun quha wald nocht pereis serve the Synagoge: because Isaias
spekes vniuersalie, and dois except na natioun, sua schir Iohne with the rest
of his halie propheites most be circumcydet. Gif he vnderstandis be Jerusalem
the kingdom of Christ, his demandis quhilk is he asks ws ar vane. The first
is quhat become of the faithful that was* betuix the making of that promeis
and the time quhilk the Roman kirk embracet the true ^eligioun: that demand I
say is vane, for the promeis said to serve the kingdom of Christ culd oblis na
man foir it begouth, suay all they quha wis betuix the ma^ing of the said
promeis and the beginning of the kin^dome of Christ culd nocht on na way be
astricted to ^he obseruatioun thairof. The secund is to schaw resi^natioun of
this promeis maid to the kirk of Rome, ^uhilk in lykmaner hes na place, for
that quhilk is pro^esed to the kingdom of Christ can nocht be resignet to ^a
other kingdom or natioun, as testefeis Daniel saing, ^is kingdom sall nocht
be geuin unto ane other people. ^uay quhatsumeuer he ansuer, he seis ane
inconuneni^^t ^o ensew, thairfoir his domandis being rejected as vane, and
superfluous I will return to the explicatioun of the ^rophecie of Isaias,
quhais wordis can nocht be onder^tand bot of the true kirk of Christ. To the
quhilk only ^ll natioun is bound to serve. The present controversy (...)
quhether gif this kirk be that quhilk this money hun^rech zeir hes been
manifest to the world and spread ^hrouch ane greit pairt of it, or the new
inuentet kirk of ^ohne Calvin. The quhilk can nocht be better decyded ^or to
considder diligently the marks and signs qu^ilkes were forspokin be the
propheites to conuein to the ^irk of Christ, And in lykemaner the ta^kines
appro^et be Christ and his Apostolis: and to quhat, ^umeuer kirk thai conuein,
without forther dispu^atioun to confess it to be the true kirk. And be ^he
contrar to reject all congregatioun of men, as ^he synagoge of Satban, with the
quhilk the for^aid marks does nocht aggrie. And to begin at Isa^as quha may
cleirlie among all the propheites ^es spoken of this kirk, he ^estifies that
the Zettis of it salbe ever oppen both nicht and day: as he wald say because
all natioun and kingdom is bound to seru^ the kirk, it salbe ever patent to
receive all quh^ plesis to enter in it. Of the quhilk it followis necessarlie
that it Salbie ever wisible and knawen to the world. Bot Zour kirk as ze
confess zour selves, he^ been invisible this money hundredth zeris: Thairfor^ it
can nocht be that kir^ of the quhilk Isaias maki^ mentioun: and consequently
it can nocht be the kir^ of god. Esai. 60.
He testifies mairour that the kings and pri^es of the earth sall walk in the
licht of it. This prophecy we find fulfillit in onr kirk, in the quhilk to
begin at Constantine the great, so m^nie Emperoures he^^randerit humble
obedience and subiectioun, and s^^moine kings and princes, that it should be
verray har^ to any man to count them. As to Zour synagog^ afoir their may
miserable dayis it hes been alluterl^^ onknawen, nocht only to the kings and
princes, bo^^ alsuay to the haill world. He sais alsuay that Christ sall
ressaue the bourding of the ^ynnes of his people* Esai. 53.
quilairthrow for his in heritance he sall possede mo^nie. In the quhilk wordis
he does testify that Christ b^ means of his passioun hes merited fra the
father t^ have ane greit mul^itude for his inheritance. the quhil^ muleitude is
sufficiently declared be him quhair h^ sais: Esai. 54.
that the sons of the relict sall forther multipli^nor the sons of her quha
has ane housband. Qu^hilk wordis in respect S. Paul doith refer to the kirk
(...) Christ, and the synagoge we collect tharbie necessarli^ the sons of the
kirk to exceid at all time be ane gre^ number the sons of the synagoge. Gal.
4.
Bot ze beand com^parit with the synagoge of the Iewis, Zour nombre (...) nocht
corre spond to tharis in any wayis. Thairfore ze can nocht be the inheritance
of Christ. Genesis 17.
we reid in lykmaner in the buik of Genesis ane promeis maid to Abraham that
his seid should incres and multiply lyk wnto the sand of the sea and sterres of
the heuin. Quhilk promeis was maid to him in the person of Isaac, quha being
borne conform to the promis^toun did represent the Christi^nis, as is contenit
in the fourt chaptour to the Galat: lyk as on the other part ^smael being borne
only conform to the ca^nell generatioun, did represent, and signify the auld
testament and synagoge of the Iewis. Sway according to the said promeis, the
seid of ^saac quhilk signifeit the Christianis, aucht to be incresset and
multipliet gretumlie be zound the seid of Ismael: bot the seid of Ismael as the
experience it self ^echis hes incresset mair nor thai quha hes prof^ssed Zour
doctrine, and as Zet dois mair incress: quhairfore ze on na ways appertein to
the seid of Abrahame. And in ane other place it is propheceit that Esau sall do
homage and obedience to his Zoungast brether Jacob. Genesis 25.
Quhilk S. Paul in lykemaner doith attribuit to the synagoge, Romans 9.
and kirk of Christ, to the quhilk the synagoge suid serve: bot the synagoge at
na time hes seruet zoure kirk, because, as ze do confess it hes been almaist
ever in^isible. Malachias testi^ies that in the Kingdom of Christ their sal^e
ane pure sacrifice offered from the Orient to the Occident. Bot ze can nocht be
able to schau any kirk quhilk ever hes offeret sic sacrifice, except that only
quhilk hes been knawen and manifest to the world: Thairfore that only is the
true kirk. And almaist all the propheites affirms that the kirk of God salbe
mair notefied and knawen at all time nor the synagoge of the Iewis: ^^l 2. ^al.
71. ^al. 102.
bot zour kirk hes been mair obscure this thousand and fyuehundreth zearis nor
the synagoge, ^ani 2. ^alac. 1. ^sai. 68. and ^9.
in respect thai have had their synagoge all this time visible, zouris be the
contrar for the may part hes been invisible: they have had, ^gger. 1.
all this time certane places deputed and ordonit to the Ceremoneis and
exerceis of their religiou^ze in pluc king down of our kirkes does gif ane
evident testimony to all men that ze war destitute alluterlie of all sic
places: suay that it is cle^rlie to understand that Christ on na wa^s hes had
that providence to wart zou, as he maste assuredly promised to his kirk. Bot
to cum to the new testament, lat ws considder quhow Christ promised his kirk to
be as ane city collocat on ane montane, ^at. 5. and ^6. Ma^h. 18. and ^8.
the quh^lk he does promeis to edify and erect in sic manner that the ports
of hell should nocht preuail aganis it bot continewand to the end of the world
should have the prerogative and power to decide all controuerseis, ^phe 4.
alsweil concernand manners as religioun. And to be schort, that it should on na
wayis inlaik pastowres nor doctoures to the end of the world. Quhilk may
ondoubted testimonies and signs of the kirk of God, gif we wald confer with
zour kirk we can nocht espy them to correspond to zou in any point. First in
respect zour kirk has remanit their money hundredth zearis in extreme darkness*
and suay on na wais can retene the name of ane city collocat on ane montane.
Secundlie, quhasumeuer in any aige hes impugnet it, that have reportet sic
victory that they have left na sign nor takin their of to the posterity.
Thirdly consinddering ze confess it to, have al may ever been invisible, ze
ar constranit also to grant that it hes never decydet onie controversy quihilk
hes rissin amanges Christian men. Last to conclude, it is nocht possible to
zou to imbring or make mentioun of any pastoures or doctoures thairof precedand
the time of Calvin. Of the quhilk every man that is nocht alluterlie blindet
and destitute of all judgment, may all reddie perceive, that quhow mekle that
ever ze gloir in the word of God, as ever did falls propheites, considdering ze
ar destitute of all sic notes and ta^knes quhilk Christ hes appointet to his
true kirk, that all zour congregatioun and assembly is na thing else bot the
synagoge of Sathane: and consequently that na man quha adheris to zou, can be
participand of the life everlasting quhilk is only promised to them quha dois
remane and perseueir in humility and obedience in the true kirk of God to the
end. Bot perchance ze will ansuer that I am deceived in the interpretatioun of
sic scripturis quhilkis I have allegit aganis zow, as it is casual to every
man, onles he have sum special assistance of the halie spreit, quhilk gif ze
do, ze will appardone me gif in lyk manner quhatsumeuer interpretatioun ze bring
in the contrar, I say that ze have been abused and begylit. Thairfor putta^d
aside both my judgment and zouris, I am content to receive for iugis of this
controversy all pastouris and doctouris quha ever hes been in the kirk of God
betuix the Apostolis and Iohne Calvin: and onles be ane universal consent thai
confess all, the kirk of God ever to have been visible and knawin to the world,
I am content to quyt my haill cause. And be the contrar gif ze can name ane
only for this zour opinioun, I am content without f^rther disputatioun to
admit quhatsumeuer. ze say to be true. This micht, have been sufficient for
ansuer to all things quhilkis ze have objected aganis me. zit that zour
ministeres believe nocht that we fear them, or that we have other opinione of
them nor that thai arfals prophetis quha hes ingyrit them self to the
vsurpatioun of the ministry of the kirk, to the effect th^^ they micht mair
li^^ntiouslie scrue their l^st and b^llie, I will propoise at lenth quhat
sumeuer ze say, and sall defraud zou of nathing, quhilk any way may be to the
auancement of zour cause.

THE REST OF SCHIR IOHNE knox ansuer.
But n^w to the taunting blasphemies of the wrytter it plesis him to term our
kirkis new found, invisible, yet but aucht year auld etc. and our ^uangel new
lie muented. which blaspheamis, albert that man spar, yet we are assured, the
eternal our God fall not suffer unpunished in this life, and in the life to
cum: onles that speady, and vnfeaned repentens blot away the same. But the
wrytter left to the judgment of God, we would knoue of him, why he calls our
kirkes new found, and our Euangell but new invented. He appears t^ give his
reasone, in th^is words (for says he) it is ma^ifest, that befoir a thousand
yearis, in all the world was there people that trow it as they do quha defendis
the contrare. This reasone conteyneth in it sic folly, besides the obscurity
and generality of it, that west: nd in dout at what member we shall begin to
confute the same. But because his greatest strength, appears to stand in this,
that befoir a thousand years, their was people in all the world that trowed as
Papistis now trow^, what sall their of yet be concluded, that our kirkis ar new
found? And will he say, that our Euangell is bot new he invented? A good d^a
lecticiane would ansuer: that albeid the antecedent war granted, the consequent
may justly be denied. And the reason is, because that nether does the kirk,
the faith of the same, nor the authority of the Euangell of Christ Jesus,
depend upon that which men believed, befoir that it was published. Nether yet is
the age of the kirk, to be compted from the time when it pleased God of his
mercy, either to reveal his word to any realm or natioun, that befoir was
ignorant of it, or yet to reform abuses, which have taken root amanges the
people of God be the negligence of men* And that this reason and proportioun is
true, the consideratioun of the planting of the kirk, and of the diverse
reformationis maid within the same, shall witness. when God callit Abrahame from
Vr of the Caldeanis, Genesis 12.
and maid to him that promise of the blissed sead, and after gave unto him the
sign of Circumcisioun: were there not people despersed universally upon the
face of the earth, what to wit and thought, that they had a good, and perfect
religioun? yea euin that same religioun (as they supposed) wherein Noha served
God. And yet we know that the spirit of God, dampneth the multitude of that
age of Idolatry: and theirintill magnifies the mercy of God, who from that
corrupted multitude, called Abraham, and be grace maid him the father of the
faithful. Now would we doma^d of the writer of the letter, if the age of
Abrahames faith, should have been measured from the error of the multitude,
that past befoir him: and if that the age of the kirk, gadderit within his
house, should have been called an aucht year auld kirk, when that Abraham had
so long obeyed God, while that all ^he world continewed in their Idolatry? we
dema^d (we ^ay) if their auld Idolatry, maid Abrahames faith to be ^ut a new
found faith: and if their multitude and vui^ersalitie having for them
antiquity, maid the kirk that was in Abrahames house to be a new found kirk? we
suppone that men of judgment shall other wise pro^unce and subscrine with ws:
that the faith of Abraham had the same antiquity, that the word had, which he
^eleued. Now plane it is, that the word which he believed was the self same
word, which God pronu^ced unto the woman in the gardine, speaklug aganis the
serpent, Genesis 3.
saing, I shall put inimitie betuix the and the woman, betuix thy seid and her
seid, that sead sall braik down thy head, and thou shall break dou^ his heal.
This promise, we say* being espetialie maid to Abraham in thase words: in thy
sead shall all* the natiounis of the earth be blissed, was the gro^ud of his
faith, lyk as that it was the ground of the faith of Adame, A bell, seth, and
of al^ the faithful befoir him: so that hir'* faith was no new faith, bot was
that same faith, wiche had continued among Godis elect from the beginning,
for true faith may not be measured from the error of me^, bot from the word,
and promise, which the faithful believe Is the word from the beginning, and the
promise undo wted the^ must, the faith, that thairupo^ is grounded, not onli^
be true, but alsuay of the same age, and antiquity tha^ the word is. And
thairfoir when soever the Papists, an^ we shall cum to reaknen of the age of
our faith: w^ doutnothing, but that their faith in mo principal poi^tis nor
one or tuo, shall be found verray Zoung, and bu^ laitly inverted: in respect of
that only true faith, Wald doma^d Quhomto h^s this reue^atio been maid?
which this day in the kirks of Scotland is professed. And the self same thing
assirme we of our kirk, and of the E^uangell preached within the same: to wit,
that the Eu^gell, which of Godis mercy is revealed unto ws is no^ forged be
man, but that it is the self same Euangel^ which Jesus Christ taught be his
awin mouth, and tha^ his apostlis at his commandment, published unto the world
And therefore, we say, that our kirk is no ne^ found kirk, Petitio principii.
(as the writer blaspheamously rayleth) bu^ that it is a part of that holy
kirk vninersall, which (...) gronded upon the doctrine of the prophets, and
A^postlis: haueing the same antiquity that the kirk (...) the Apostles hes, as
concerning doctrine, prayers, adm^^nistratioun of Sacrame^tis, and all other
things requ^site to a particulare kirk. But yet will the writer of the letter
allege, that we believe not as the most part (...) men have believed a thousand
years, and moir. (...) they believed the Mess to be a sacrifice propitiatori^
for the sins of the quick and dead: the Pape to be the head of the kirk, and
Christ's vicare in the earth: the natural body of Christ Jesus, flesche blood,
and bane, to be in the sacrament of the alter, after that the wordis of
consecratioun were prononced be a preast, Super materia debita: that the prayers
of the leuing* profit the departed, and sic others as the Catholic faith of
the Papists have concluded. These articles will the writer say we believe not:
and therefore, whou can it be denied but that our kirk is new found and the
doctrine thairof is new, we have ansuered, and yet we ansuer agane, that
whatsoever Papists have believed befoir ws, which has no better ground than
the determinatioun of their owen counsall, can nether preiudge our faith
grounded upon Godis expressed word, All this is not to the propois.
nether yet can prove our kirk to be but a new found kirk* for gif ane commoun
error, and a superstitious worshipping of God, received of a multitude should
have that strength, that it should preuale against Godis* simple truth, and
against his worshipping presc^iwed in his word: then had the propheit Helias
been into a miserable conditioun: who being but one man, opponed him self to
the king, to his counsall, to his prophets, preastes, and people, and in plane
words accused them all of apostasy, from his God, from his true worschipping
and from the obedience of law: and planely co^uicted them, to be Idolatoures,
because they had imbrafed a worshipping of God, not contained in his word. It is
a wonder that the king, with his preastes, and propheites excepted not against
the propheit, and said: whow ea^ that be Idolatry, which our kings and people
sense the days of Ieroboa^ have used, and ma^teyned for Gods true service, Thou
art but one man, and we are a multitude how ca^ it be, that thou only should
pleis God. But no such thing find we objected wnto the propheit. But his
requeast being but ane man was obeyed: which was, that god him self, should
judge betuix him and them, as that he did, be fire from the heaven. This
privilege crave we to be granted to ws, of the Papists in our days, to wit
that they suffer god to judge betuix our religione, and theirs: what he
approves, let it be approuen of both, and what be him is not commandet nor be
the Apostles of Jesus Christ established, and practiced, let it be of boith
rejected, and so shall we suddanelie aggre. But if that will still cry, that we are schis matykes and Apostates, because we refuse to defyle our selves, with
their abhominationis: we can nor but appeal from their corrupt sentence, to
the vncorrupt judge, of whose favors we are assuredly persuader in the point,
because he has said, follow not the multitude in e^il doing: and because that we
find kingis propheites, and people befoir ws, to have done the self same thing
in their days (and therefore to ^aue been approved of god) which we in godis
fear, have done in our days: so wit they have distroyed the monumentis of
Idololatrie, and have repressed the same externally, be power and force,
notwithstanding she antiquity thereof, and that great multitude adheared unto
it And this much for the multitude, and that which the multitude most
commonly believes. Now to the further ^essonis of the writer. He first tauntis
and mockis ws and our kirk, calling it your invisible kirk of ^cotland.
Secondly he a^^irmeth, that the kirk whereof the Prophet speaks, salbe
manifest and visible through all the world And for his prove alleges the
second chaptour of the propheit Isaias. And last he concludes in thais words:
wherefore if ye can not shaw in what place of the world afoir three hundret^
year your kirk was into ^t follows of necessity that it is no kirk. To
thais heads we must ansuer in ordour, and first we will pray the writer in his
nixt ansuer, to signify wnto ws, why he calls the kirk of Scotland invisible
seeing that the ground, and the persons inhabitant within the same ar s^biect
to the senses of all those, that list to look upon the^e: yea the doctrine
ta^ght unto ws, is so patent, that the verray enemies them selves, are not
forbidden to hear, and to judge of it. And finally the a^ministratioun of the
sacraments within our kirkes, are so publict, that none justly (...)
co^pleane, that they ar either debarred from hearing or from sight, And
therefore howsoever it pleases the writer, to delight him self in his owen
vanity, we fear not to affirm that the kirk of God within Scotland this day,
is as visible, as ever it was in Iernsalem, after that Christ Jesus received
the euangell: yea, we will forther affirm, that the true kirk of Jesus Christ,
is as visible, yea and as beutifull in all her proper orname^tis this day,
within the realm of Scotland, as ever sche was in Corinthus, Galatia,
Philippi, yea or yet in Rome it self, what time that any of the Apostles rewled
them: or that when they were saluted be the Apostles in his epistles, for
kirkis And this for the first head.

TE REFVTATIOVN
OTheir ze have calumniat my argument, or ze heue nocht onderstand it, for of
the discourse of my letter it is easy to every man to perceive, that my
argument was this. That thai, quha afoir ane thousand zeare, was acknawlegit
for true Christianis throw the haill warid, professed the co^trare religioun to
that quhilk ze profess. Sway gif ze had ansuerit to the propois, ze aucht to
have co^damned them as followares of falls and pernicious doctrine. Thairfore
to omschew the difficulty of the matter, ze say, that the age of the kirk,
aucht nocht to be compted from the time quhen it plesis God, to reueal his
word to any natioun, Quhilk albeit it be true, zet nocht withstanding, geuand
that the word may be of lait re^elit to any particalare natioun, it can nocht
be of lait reuelit to the haill world: Quhilk we affirm of zour doctrine,
because as the experience it self teachis, it was onknawen immediately afoir ane
hundredth zeare* nocht only to the realm of Scotland, bot alsua to the haill
world. Thairfore it can nocht be the word of God, quhilk as it was reuealit
from Christ, sua sen him it hes ever been conseruet in the world. And quhen
ever it hes pleasit him to reueill it to any natioun, quhilk afoir was
ignorant, he hes used them as instrumentis thairof, to quhome of befoir it was
reuealit: sua that we aucht nocht to abide any new reuelatioun, maid to Iohne
Calvin, or Schir Iohne knox: bot to embrace that relig^oun quhilk anis being
reuealit, and maid manifest to the world, hes according to the promeis of
Christ, be the assistance of the halie spreit, ever been conseruet in it: lyk
as it falbe conseruet, in despite of Satan, and all his ministeris, to the end
of the world. Zet to cloik zour ignorance, ze ar nocht aschamed to compare zow
to Abraham, and Helias: and zour kirk, to the kirk of God, quhilk was in their
time. Bot to the effect, that na man be deceived be sic vane persuasionis, I
will declare, that another ze may be compared onie way with them, or zour new
inuen^ed kirk, to that kirk quhilk that acknawlegit. For as concerning
Abrahame, it is may aggreable to the verity, that he did, with all constance
retene, and profes that religioun, quhen he received the circumcisioun of God,
in the quhilk a lang time preceida^d, he had been instructed be his
predecessouris: quhairin gif he had been requerit, he culd have sufficiently
schawin, continuatioun from the beginning of the world to him, and to them be
quhome he was instructed. Quhairfore gif zour proceeding is be coincida^d with
Abrahame, we desire zow to adduce sufficient testimonieto prove that religion,
quhilk ze profes, to have been autorised in all agis, sen the time of Christ to
zow or ellis be nocht so impudent, to compare zow to Abrahame, considdering it
does nocht appeir, that Christ hes had les providence of the kirk, sen se
sched his may precious blude for it, nor he hade in the days of Abrahame. Bot
perchance gif ze be nocht lyk Abrahame, ze will be lyk Helias: for as Helias
reprouit Achab, together with the superstitioun, quhilk he, and the haill
multitude did follow, notwithstanding the lang continuatioun of the same, to
wit betuix the time of Hieroboam and that present time of Achab, sua ze, and
zour prophetis dois reprove all them, quhasoeuer follouis the auld, and
Catholict Religioun. Thairfoir we will discus quhether zour religioun, or
ours, be mair conform to that, quhilk was professit be Helias. And to be
schort Helias did nocht induce ane new religioun, and of befoir unknown to the
haill world bot professit that, quhilk the synagoge of the Jews had embraced
from the beginning, and to that present time continuet. suay Helias, as said is
of Abrahame, culd have schawin successioun of lawchtfull paustouris, quha had
ever professit his doctrine: And thairfoir reprouit Achab, because he had
rejected the religioun, embraced be the Synagoge, and did follow ane may
abominable superstitioun, of lait days institute be Hieroboam. Albeid ze wald
syle the redars eyes, euin as it had been ane la^g time betuix Achab and
Hieroboa^, quhilk did nocht mekle exceid the spaice of forty zearis. Bot gif
ze had co^sidderit diligently, the history of Helias and Achab, ze micht have
thairby understand, zow and the remane^t of zour prophetis, to be justly
co^parit to the prophetis of Achab: 3. Reg. 1^.
for as is co^tenit in the third buke of the kingis, Hieroboa^ did co^stitute
unto him self te^plis in the heichast places, and preistes of the co^mou^
people, quhilk c^^trar to the co^stitutiou^ of the synagoge war nocht of the
trybe of Leui. To quhome justly zour ministeris does correspond: for as in
the synagoge, they were only lauchfull ministeris, quha descenait of the try^e
of Leui: suay in the new testament, they ar only lauchfull ministeris, quha be
the ordour of pre^sth^d has receaned sic power, and authority, like as we sall
heirefter mair fullelie declair. Quhairfoir it does necessarlie follow that ze
ar the pristis of Baal, have and togidder with Hieroboam (I mean Calvin) sallin
from the true, and universal kirk* to Idolatry, that is, to zour
fantastical imaginations and dreamis, fra the quhilk ze ar callit heretics,
like as the Grik word (...) doith signify electioun, or chois, because ze have
chosin to zour self ane religioun, by the universal consent of the haill
world: and suay as S. Paul says be verteis of zour awin judgment, ze ar
condemned, rtull. De ^sc. heret.
be resson as interpretis Tertullian, ze have elect^d, and chosin that wnto
zou, on the quhilk zour condemnatioun does justly follow, quhairfore ze
mister nocht to call God so often to witness. quha has all reddy pronunced his
sentence aganis zou, to be haldin as ane ethni^k, and publican, in respect, ze
do nocht Obey his kirk* pri. Der^ecelesi.
For as testifies Cipriane* he sall nocht in any sort have God to his father,
quha refuset the kirk to h^s mother, and quh^ is nocht ane membre of the body
of Christ, can nocht be quikned ^e his spreit.

THE REST OF SCHIR Iohne knox ansuer.
THe ansner to the secund can nocht be so schort, for his assertioun agg^eis so
little with the place of the Propheit, that we (...) in dout, whether he has
traveled to understand the mind of the propheit. His assertion is this. Of the
kirk whereof the propheit speaks, it is said be him in the secu^d chap: that
it shall be manifest and visible through all the world. The words of the
propheit at these.

It shall be in the last days, that the montane of the house of the lord shall be
prepared in the top of the montanis, Isai. 2.
and shall be exalted above the hills and all nationes sall flow unto it. And
many people shall go and say: cum, let ws go up unto the montane of the lord,
to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will reach ws his ways, and we will
walk in his paths. For the law shall go forth of Syon, and the word of the
lord from Jerusalem, and he shall judge among the nationes, and rebuke many
people, etc.

In thais wordis of the propheit, we find no such thing as the kirk shall be
manifest and visible through all the world we acknawledge a promise of glade
things, to cum to be joined to Jerusalem, and unto mont ^yon, after the
miserable distructioun of the same. we find the time appointed, to wit, the
last days. But that the promise may be better tried, we must ^now of the
writer, when these last dayis began, and quhen they shall be compleit. We must
further know, if there be any one certane place appointed* in the which it is
said that the kirk of God shall be visible* and manifest in all ages These tuo
heads being considdered, it shall be moir easy to judge of the assertioun of
the writer, and whou it aggreis with the mind of the propheit. And first we
think, that the writer will nocht deny, but the last days, whereof the propheit
speaks, began long befoir that ever the Euangell of Jesus Christ was known,
or publictlie received in Rome, Heb. 1.
to wit at the appearing of Jesus Christ in the flesh, when that ^e reveled
unto the world the hole will of his father. For so ar we taught be the apostle
sayng: God in auld times spak unto our fatheres, in diverse manners be the pro,
hetes: in the last days, he has spoken to ws, be his sone etc. and the
Apostle Peter, in that his most notable sermon made to Jerusalem, the day of
Penthecost, Act. 2.
affi^es, that the prophecy of Ioell maid, as concerning the pouring forth of
Gods graces, upon all flesh in the last days, was even then compleit, quhen
that the holy spreit descended down upon those that believed. So then we have
gotten the last days to have begun with Jesus Christ, who is the glory of the
secund temple: This is n^^^ing to the ^opos.
when think we that they ended. If the writer will say, ^ when Rome received the
Euangel then was the accomplishement of the last days As men justly may dout
thairof, so will the apostle planelie deny it saying: the spreit speaks
euide^tlie, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith etc. Whereof
we may gadder, that the Apostle appoints, the last times to continue longer,
then that the Euangell was ones publictly preached: to wit, till that me^
should begin to sall from the faith, and give airis to the doctrine of
deuilles. Yea if we will search the scriptures, we shall find that the last
days continue from the first appearing of Jesus Christ in flesh, unto his
last returning unto judgment. So that the last days, do not only include the
first publicatioun of the Euangell, but also the defectioun from it, (...)
yea, and the restitutioun of it agane, unto the world: be the brightness
whereof, that man of sin should be revealed, and distroied: whereof we conclude
that if the last days do yet continue, whereof the prophet makes mentioun, the
things promised to be performed in theme, are not yet altogether compleit,
but ar in their progres, and shall so procead, (...)
till that all be finished that is for spoken be the holy prophets, and
Apostles of Jesus Christ. And so may Jesus Christ this day, be working in
Scotland* albeit that Papists rage against his Euangell, as in thase days he
wroght in Jerusalem, when the preastes and the hole visible ^kirk (for the
most part) raged against the same. But now to the secund head.

we wald know, if the wrytar can appoint unto ws any one certane place, whair
this montane of God, is promised to Remane, manifestly and visible. For this
we make known to the hole world, that for the lufe we bear to the building and
reparing of Gods holy house, we have endangered life, and ^ all things
temporal. And theirfoir if the writter can appoint wnto ws, a certane place,
whereunto God hes maid ^ promise, we shall every one exhort an other with all
diligence to go up tharu^to. But if he can appoint none, haueing greater
assurance be Gods mouth, more then an other: then will we cheritabillie desire
him, to desist from taunting and mockage of so notable works of God, as he of
late years hes shawen in mo realms tha^ one. Our master Christ Jesus
apointes ws, to no one certane place, where that we shall be assured of his
presens: but reather forbidding the obseruatioun of all places, he sendes ws to
his owen spiritual presence, saying: wheresoever two or thrie are gathered in
my name, there am I in the midst of them. Matt. 28.
And in ane other place, behold I am with zow to the end of the world. we being
grounded upon these promyses, have good hope through Jesus Christ, that in
oure^ congregationis. Matt. 18.
we have the favorable presence of Jesus Christ, asweill in his word, as in his
holy sacraments. For in his name alone conuene we, be him alone we call upon
God our father: and be^ him alone we are assured through the power of his holy
spreit, to obtene our reque^stis maid according to his will we wonder greatly
that the writer considderis not, petitio prin^^ pii.
the promise of the propheit ^s^ that all nationis shall cum to that holy
montane. we are a natione (how abject that ever we appear) why then will the
writer deny wnto ws fre passage to the house of the lord: seeing that the term
of the last days is not yet expyred, and seeing that we desire to be taught in
the ways of the lord, and to walk in his paths: yea, seeing that thousands in
Scotland refuses not to be rebuked of the lord, and to suffer him to judge
amanges ws. If the writer will say, because we will not acknawlege Rome, to be
the mother of all other kirkes: we ansuer as of befoir, let ws hear the
commandment of our God, charging ws so to do, and our obedience shall not be
long craved. For we are most willing to obey our mother: providing that she
show the ondouted signs of a natural mother. But an usurped title, without
farther assurance, we dar not admit. And this for his assertioun, and for the
mind of the Propheit.

THE REFVTATION.
THe probatioun quhilk I used in my letter to prove the kirk to be visible was,
because Isaias testifies, that the house of Jacob salbe builded upon the top of
ane montane: of the quhilk words I collect, that it should be visible. Schir
Iohne knox ansueris that he perceaues nocht quhow that may be collected of the
words of Isaias. Because he spekes only of glaid things promised to
Jerusalem, and mont Syon. In the quhilk ansuer, he declares no thing, bot his a
wen blindness. For the Propheit testifies, that the house of Jacob (be the quhilk
the kirk au^ht to be understand) salbe builded upon the top of ane montane:
Christ in his Euangell says, Mat. 5.
that ane citt^e builded upon ane montane, can n^cht be hid: of the quhilk, it
followis necessarlie, that his kirk ca^ nocht be hid, and consequently it must
be visible. Suay, other Isaias be that Metaphore schawis the kirk to be visible
and manifest, or ellis it seruts to no thing at all quhilk is ane blasphemy.
The words that follows, dois conferme this so cleirlie, that no man onles he
be blind can any way dout thairof: Money people, says he, sall flow to the house
of Jacob, to that effect, that they may be taught the ways of the lord: quhow
is it possible that they flow to the kirk, onles it be visible and manifest: or
quhow is it possible, that they be taught the ways of the lord, onles they
acknaulege thois, be quhome they ar to be instructed. Suay gif Schir Iohne had
put on his specticles, he micht have seen easalie, that Isaias dois testify in
thais words the kirk to be visible. I pretermit the Grik text (quhilk ever,
all may S. Paul used in his citations, and ever hes been in great authority)
is so cleir for me, that it ca^ na way be thrawin to ane other sense (...),
that is, the montane of the lord salbe manifest. Suay dois the ancient
fatheres, ever allmaistreid this prophecie^as Tertullian, Cypriane, Tert.
contr^^ Iud. Cyp. lib. 3. ad Quir.
Augustene, and the rest. Thairfore, as apperis, noch^ content of his first
ansuer, he propones to use ane other, that is, Augu. de vni^tate ecclesi^*
that the prophecy of Isaias is nocht as zet compleit, bot in the progres.
Quhilk manner of ansuering hes ever been comoun to all falls prophetis. Gif this
prophecy be nocht compleit, I wald demand at his ministers, quhether gif the
house of ^acob, was in the top of the montane, quhen the Apostlis, and disciplis
of christ prechit his Euangell all may throuch the haill world: quhether gif
than money people, did flow unto the montane of the lord: qnhether gif than, the
montane of the quhilk Daniel makis mentioun, did occupy the hail earth: Dan. 2.
quhether gif than christ received the inheritance, promised to him be his
father eternal. I believe quhousoeuer they be impudent, they dar nocht deny the
premissis. Than I collect necessarlie, that lang afoir Iohne Calvin, or Iohne
knox, the prophecy of Isaias was furthfilled, and the house of Iocob was in the
top of ane montane: that is, visible and manifest to the world, suay it salbe
visible and manifest, nocht only for ane hundredth zear, or two, bot for ever,
as testifies the for said propheit: the zeties of the kirk salbe ever patent
day and nycht: and so, Esa. 60.
according to Schir Iohne knox awin interpretatioun, be the letter letter days,
we understand the hail time quhilk is betuix the publicatioun of the Euangell,
and the day of judgment, during the quhilk, the house of Jacob salbe in the top
of the montane. Zet he will nocht be sati fiet onles we schaw him the place, in
the quhilk the montane of the lord remanis. Thairfoir he speris at ws, quhair
is this montane? Dan. 2.
Daniel ansueris that it hes occupeit the hail earth: Zet Schir Iohne knox is so
blind that he dois nocht se it, The scriptures teches ws that the inheritance,
and kingdom of Christ, quhilk is his kirk, salbe ever spread through ane greit
part of the world, and mair ample and magnificent, Psalm. 102.
nor ever was any kingdom afoir him, Psalm. 114.
in the quhilk his name ^uld be louit, Psalm. 112.
and glorifiet for ever, to the quhilk the kings and princes of ye earth should
serve: Psalm. 95.
that it is ane greit marueill, that ever any man should be so impudent, to say,
that Christ hes been private of his kingdom and inheritance this money hundredth
Zearis: and that Satan hes possessed the hoill world, all kingdomis,
provinces, cities: or that Christis kingdom hes been alluterlie invisible, and
onknowen to the world. Zet tot^e effect, that Schir Iohne knox, nor his
ministers have na excu^se, nor pretense of ignorance in the day of judgment, I
will ansuer direct^ie to his doma^d: that the montane of the lord is in france,
Spa^ze, Italy, Germany, Pole, and sindrie v^heris partis of Europ, and in
innumerable cuntreis of inde, batth Orie^tall and Occidentall, and nocht
all^terlie expirit in ingland and Sc^^land. Suay that his kingdom is mair
ample for the ^resent, nor ever was the empire of the Gr^k^s, or Romany. B^t I
feir gretumly that his ministers ansuer, as the Donatistis dit to S. Aug. in
epist.
Augustene quhen the montane of the lord [says he] is schawin to them, Joan.
tract. 1.
they say, it is nocht to montane of the lord, thai ar so blindit with their a
win fantasies because Schir Iohne will acknowlegeno place quhair this mo^tane
should be, bot will only, that we have recours to the spiritual presence of
Christ, quhilk is expreslie aganis Isaias, quhae sais, that money people sall
flow unto this montane, quhilk in na ways they culd do, onles they did
acknawlege sum certane place quhair it should be: and repugnant to Christ him
self, quhair he sais, Mat. 18.
Gif thy brother offend the accuse him to the kirk: we can make nae accusatioun
to the kirk, onles we acknawlege in quhat place it is. Of the quhilk is it
appearis evidently, to be ane greit blasphemy quhilk Schir Iohne knox
affirms, that Christ app^intes na certane place to ws, bot be the cotrar
forbidd^s all obseruatioun of places. Zet lat ws considder ane litill his
ressone, be the quhilk he is mouet to sic impiety. In Saint Matthow Christ
says, quhen ever tuo, Math. 18.
or three, ar gatherit in my name, their I am in the mids of them. Of this
propofitioun, Schir Iohne collectis, that Christ appointes to ws no certane
place, quhair we sall find him. I can nocht marvel aneuch of his impudency,
for in the same cheptour, a litill afoir the word is quhilk he rehersis for his
opinioun, Christ commandis ws to gang to his kirk: than he dois nocht forbid
all obseruat^oun of places, bot be the contrar prescryues ane certane place to
the quhilk we should have recours: suay onles we say he repugnis to him self,
Schir Iohne knox can na way collect of thais wordis, quhilk he citis for him,
any thing for the auancement of his opinioun, bot rather the contrar. For in
that chaptour, Christ recommandis to ws his lufe, and charity, and obedience
to his kirk: And ester, he proposis the reward their of, that quhen sumeuer
tuo, or three, ar gadderit in his name, he salbe in the middis of them. But
afoir that they be assured that they ar gadderit in the name of Christ, they
most be assured that they keip luf, and obedience to his kirk: suay first they
aucht to be assured of the kirk, and of mutual lufe, and charity with
vtheris: and thare^^er they may be assured, that they ar gadderit in his name.
Bot Schir Iohne dois pervert all ordour, in safar as he wald be certifiet, that
we are gathered in the name of Christ, afoir that we be assured of his kirk. At
the end of zour ansuer, ze do inquire of me, gif the vuinersall world, and all
nations be call it to pas up in the montane of the lord, and to the house of the
God of Jacob* quhy wald I nocht that Scotland passes up with the rest. Veralie
I do nocht only may effectiouslie desire it, bot alsuay prays God that they
pas up with all earnest full diligence. Bot I desire nothing les, nor they
follow zow, or zour ministers as gyderis of them: in caice they do nocht only,
nocht ascend to the hill, bot rather descend, errand and straiand in the vales
thairof. For treulie, gif Scotland do only now of lait days, pas up with zou
to the montane of the lord, and at na time preceid and has rejected the zok of
idolatry, nor embraced the Euangell of Christ, the estate their of hes been
may miserabill, and repugnant to all scriptures. For Isaias says in the
person of Christ, the ilis of the sea^, and schippes their of does abyd me
from the beginning. Isai. 60.
Fra the quhilk expectatioun, I believe nocht our i will to have been secludit:
nor zit fra that blythnes, quhair of David makes mentioun in this manner: The
lord has regnit, Psalm. 96.
lat the earth re ose, together with money isles. Bot gif the insatiable desire of
warldlie po^pe, and riches, has tholit zou to have considderit the ancient
histories, ze micht have cleirlie perceived, Scotland lang befoir zour days to
have passit up to that montane: Ze mycht have red quhow that Lucius king of
Britanny, Marianus Scotus lib. 2. in vita Anso nini Imperatoris.
did send legatis to Eleutherius bischop of Rome for the time, to the effect he
micht be end wit with the true religioun. Like alsuay as ane litill after,
Polido. lib. 2.
Donald king of Scottis, Nauclerus in sua histo.
did send to the same effect, to Victor than bischop of Rome, during the empire
of Seuerus. Tertullian affirmith Britanny to the subdeit to the realm of
Christ quhilk at na time culd be (...) wit to the Roman empire. S. Veremu^dus
in sua hist. et in antiquissimis scotoru^ annalibus.
Hierome says, that the Brita^nis, apperith nocht to them selves to be halie
aneuch nor deuoit, onles they passit in pilgramage to Jerusalem. Tert. contra
Iudeos.
And in ane other place, does esteem Britanny amangis the principal, Hier. ad
Marcel.
and first partis of the Christianity. Pelagius pretendit at sum time to have
seducit the realm of Scotland from this mo^tane: bot Celestinus than bischop
of Rome (as testifies Prosper) willing to put remeid thairto did send Palladius
in Scotland ane man of singular doctrine, Hier contra Luciferian.
and conuersatioun of life, Prosper contra collatore^
quha nocht only conseruit the integretie of Scotland in the formar estait, bot
alsuay did convert Orknay and the isles, to the true religiou^, quhair of the
monument is does continue in Scotland to this present hour. Bot ze and zour

NOw folloueth his conclusioun in thais wordis. wherfoir if ye can not shaw,
what place of the world afoir three hundredth year it is, your kirk was into, it
follows of necessity that it is no kirk etc.

How this conclusioun may be rightly gathered of the wordis of the propheit,
Quhow it ^ay be co^lec ^it it is al^eddie recla^it.
we suffer the readers, and the writer him self to considder. And yet because
that till us it were a thing most grievous so to be excommunicat, that we were no
kirk: that is, no parcel of the holy kirk universal we ansuer for our entres
and say: that befoir 15. hundredth yearis out kirk was in Ieruslem, in Samaria,
in Antiochia, and wheresoever Christ Jesus was trewlie preached, and his
b^^ssed euangell obedie^tlie received, whether it was among the ^ewes or
gentilis. Their we say was our kirk, which is not bound to any one place, but
is dispersed upon the face of the hole earth, having on god, on faith, on
baptism, and on lord Jesus savior of all that vnfeanedly believe. And so we
fear not to receive the titill and authority of a particular kirk, because we
have all things be Gods word that thereto apparteanes. Yea we are farther bold
to affir me, that if ever it shall pleis God to bring the kirk of rome to her
original purity that the shall not be ashamed to embrace and reverence the
pure kirk of Scotland* as her dearast sister and nixt resembling her in all
things: befour that pride and avarice, joined with idelnes and riatous leuing
corrupted her ministers and that the inue^tionis of me^ were preferred to Gods
simple treuth. we say yet agane that whenever the kirk of Rome shall ebi
reduced to that estait, in the which the apostles left it, we are assured that
she shall vote in our fauores, against all such as shall deny ws to be a kirk
if God continue us in that simplicity which is mocked of the world. Now let us
hear whou the writer proceadeth.

TE REFVTATIOVN
NOw to cum to the conclusioun of my argument, quhilk was that gif ze culd
nocht schaw in quhat place of the world zour kirk was, immediately afoir this
three hundredth zeir, that it culd nocht be the true kirk. Ze ansuer it was
Hierusale ane thousand and fynehundre^h zeir syne Quhilk gif it be direct, any
man may cleirlie understand for ze do tak and assnme that for probatioun of
zour cause quhilk is in gretast controversy. Marouer, ze war nocht domandet
quhair it was afoir ane thousand and fyuehundreth zeiris, bot quhair it was
immediately afoir threhundreth zeris. Suay as zit, ze have ansuerit nothing to
the propos Thairfoir I will persist in my former doma^d, and gif zour ministers
can no htschaw in quhat place the k^^k of God was immediately afo^r their last
three hundret zeiris that are constranit to grant that the inheritance of Christ,
quhilk dois comprehend ewer ane greit part of the world according to all
scriptures, Mich. 4.
was alluterlie inuisibill and vnkn^we^, Dan. 2.
quhilk in it self is repugnant To be schort I wald domand them, Isai. 60.
quhether gif during the time of the co^ceill of Nice, Psalm. 2.
they quha was estemit for pastouris of the kirk, Psalm. 21.
were pastouris in verray deide or nocht: for gif they were pastoures, the
ministers and pastouris of our kirk (co^siddering thai profes the self same
doctrine with them, and is chosin be ane lyk manner of vocatioun to the
ministry of the kirk) ar in lyk wais to be estemit as pastoures. Gif thai
quha was in the co^ceill of Nice was noc^t true pastouris, I believe that they
sall-nocht be albe to name any true pastor of the kirk, afoir Iohne Calvin.
Quhilk gif it be according to Goddis word (in the quhilk ze appear to gloir) I
leave the judgment to the readar.

OF this part of the writers letter, and of that whilk is p^st befoir, it is
easy to co^sidder, that he will acknawledge no kirk to be the true kirk of
Jesus Christ, onles that is can shaw the deu successioun their of from the days
of Jesus Christ. And farther that the teachers of it, do so aggre in doctrine,
that in no point they be found to differ on from ane other. We ansuer if the
immaculat spous of Jesus Christ were, bound to thais tuo extremities, the
bondage thairof were may miserable: but because we find our master Jesus
Christ is moir favorable to his pure kirk, than master Tyrie craves, we are
decreed to stand in that fredome and liberty, whereunto our head and only
souerane lord hes called us. we find that he sendis nocht his afflicted kirk to
seak a ^^neall successioun of any personis, befoir that he will receive them:
but he with all ge^^^lnes calls his sheap unto him self saying: cu^ unto me
all^ ye that labor and ar laden, Matt. 11.
and I will ease you* And agane, all that the father gives me, Ioh. 6.
shall cum to me: and him that comes to me I cast not away. O golden and most
confortable sentence, pronu^ced of him who can not lie. Heir is no mention of
any successioun that we should clame to, befoir that we be received of him, who
is the head of the ki^k: but only it is said: that that which the father
gives, and that the sone receaueth shall not be cast away: nather yet will he
lose any that cummeth to him, but that he will save them and raze them up at
the last day. And the Apostle speking of the vocatioun of the Gentiles send is
them not to seak a successioun: but in the person of the Ephesianes pronunced
this sentence in fauores of all that believe Jesus Christ. Now thairfoir ye ar
no moir strangers and foraners, Ephe. 2.
but citizens with the sanctis, and of the houshald of God. And ar builded upon
the fundatioun of the Apostles and prophets. Jesus Christ him self being the
chief corner stone: in whom all the building coupled together groueth unto a
holy tempill in the lord. Heir we find men which befoir were strangers maid
cietizenes with the sainctis, and of the houshald of God, we find Jesus Christ,
to be the cherf corner stone: but we find no mentioun of any fic successioun as
master Tyrie^ seameth rigorously, and without Godis commandment to crave.
And thairfoir we can not bot wonder why that mortal ma^shall crave of ws,
that, which nether God the father his sone Christ Jesus, nather yet the holy
Apostlis in their ministry craved of any realm or natioun. And thairfoir let
Master Tyrie tak this for an ansuer. That an iniust requeast may justly be
denied. And yet least that the writer or any other should think them selves
rather mocked then ansuered. We add to the premissis that we are able to shaw
the successioun of our kirk directly, and laughfullie to have flowed, from the
apostlis And our reason is because that in our kirkis we nather admit
doctrine, ryte, nor ceremony, which be their writtingis we sind not authorized.
And albeit that this shall not satiffe the new start up Jesuits: yet our
consciences at rest Because we are assured to be awowed of the supreme judge.

THE REFVTATIOVN.
VEralie gif their had been na thing in all zour buke, bot th^s, of the quhilk
ze micht have been co^uicted to be ane falls propheit, this only were sussicient.
Ze say Christ does call all man unto him, bot it is may certane that he dois
call no man unto him, bot be the means of his pastouris and ministers, as
special instrument is thairof quhome he hes institute as ane sure way to ws,
be the quhilk we should cu^ unto him: lyk as he says, quha herith zou herith me,
and quha contenit zou co^temnit me. ^nc. 10.
For the apostolis, and their successouris, ar appointed only to the
government of the kirk as testifies S. Luk, sayng, have dilligent cure of zour
selves, Acto. 20.
and of the haill flok to the quhilk the halie gaist hes co^stitute zou, to the
effect ze may govern the kirk of God. And suay in respect heir of quhasoeuer
pretendis to usurp the ministry of the kirk, be ane other way and resson,
nor be the gouernouris quhilk is the halie spreit hes constitute in it, they ar
ondoutedlie falls prophetis bot (as the experience it self teachis, and zour
selves dois all reddie co^fes) ze ar on naways enterit in the ministry of the
kirk be this way* thairefoir necessarlie ze declair zour selves to be falls
prophetis Christ hes left this ordour in his kirk to the effect the true
pastouris should be discernit from, the wolfis, as may be cleirlie collected of
the maste express word of God, and continual obseruatioun from the beginning
of the kirk to the present, for the apostolis does nocht usurp their
authority, Ad Heb 5.
bot was callit and chosin thairto be Christ him self, Act 13.
after quhais asceosioun Mathaias in lyk manner was ordanit and electit be
them, 1. Timoth. 4.
quhome Chaste had appointitri to the government of his kirk. And S. Act. 1.
Paul, albeid he was extraordinarlie called, and anonted for ane apostole be
the halie spreit, zit not withstanding he was sent to Ananias to receive
baptism, and thairefter passes to ^erusalem, to the effect he micht confer
his Euangell with the remanent of the apostolis. Acto. 9.
to that end [as he testifiet] that he ran nocht in vane, as he wald say that
his labourts^ in preching of the Euangell other wais had nocht been profitable,
Ad Gal. 2.
onles he had prouin his doctrine with the universal consent of the kirk
quhilk was than. And quhen he was send conform to the consuetude of the
Apostlis to exercise that office, they quha precedit dit indew him with the
ord^ur of preisthed, Act. 13.
to the effect he micht be acknawlegit be the haill pastouris of the kirk Be
the quhilk not, the true ministers as than was discernit from the false
prophetis. sa^ct Paul in lykmaner (as he writtis) after this form and custom,
did institute Titus and Timotheus, to the minist^ri^ of the kirk, and wrelt and
to Tymotheus, did command him expreslie to admit na man hastily to sic ordour,
1. Timoth. 4.
as he had receauit f^o^ him, Quhair throw we are mast certanlie instructed,
that sic ordour and institutioun is necessarlie requirit to them quha wald be
estemit as lauchfull pastoures. Thairfore considder gif ze and the remanent of
zour pastouris h^s enterit be this means in the kirk of God, or at the leist,
understand zour selves thairbie, to be falls prophet^^, gif ze have nocht
acknawlegit that heir until. For in thi^ manner (as said is) the false prophets
hes been ever discernit from the lauchfull pastoures, as testifies Tertullian
of the false prophetis of his age, sayng, amongis the heretik^s ane bischop is
constitute this day, and ane other surrogat in his place the morn: Tert de
Presheret.
and siclyk beand ane deiken the day, the m^rne is constitute ane reader, for
it is tolerable amangis them, to attribuit and inione spiritual offices to
layke personis: Like alsuay as Cypriane writis, that quhasoeuer constitutes
them self pastouris without the ordinance of the law, Cyp. de unit. e^cle.
and indewit them self with the tytill of ane b^schop without any ordinar
power preceding, thaying ire them in the kirck, contrar to the word and
dispositiou^ appointet be God. And in ane other place, gif Nouatus (says he)
hes with him the kirk of God, than C^rnelius of Rome necesserlie man be separat
from the kirk: Epistola ad Magnum.
and be the contrar gif Cornelius hes the true kirk, Nouatus can na way
appertene thairto, because as is cleir and manifest he hes succedit to na other
bischop, suay on na wais he can be ane lauchfull pastor of the kirk.
Athanasius [as testifies Socrates] being scharplie accusit be the Arrians, that
he had interpry fit to brek the chalice, Socrates lib. i. cap. x.
and cast dou^ the altar quhairo^ isc^yras did offer sacrifice, Theod^retus
lib. 2. ca. 8.
quha te^ding to purge him self of this intollerabill crime, grantit all that
quhilk was obiectit, bot subion and him to have iustile done it, in respect
Ischyras, head at na time receawis onie lauchfull pouar or ordour of preisteid
be verteu of the quhilk he culd have power, to make sic sacrifice or oblatio^.
S. H^er. being doma^ dit, quhat apperit to him of ane Hylarius quha had fallin
from the kirk of God, Hier. co^t. Luciferianos.
he ansuerit, that in respect he was only ane de^ken, he culd have na
lawchfull power to ministrat that sacrament of the altar, nor instituat
ministers indewed with the ordour of preisthed: And th^irfo^r throw his deith,
his kirk should necessarly pereis, for the true kirk [sais he] an nocht consist
with out ane priest. Gifs. Hierome and the rest of the doctouris of that age
micht have affirms the lyk of Zou I make zour selves iugis. S. Augustene,
together with the fatheris quha was present with him in the fourt counceill of
Carthage, at lenth dois declair this manner of institutioun of ministers, quhick
ever in the kirk of God was obseruet afoir him, Conc. 4. car^. can. 2.
and is obseruit to this present: that ane priest aucht to be consecrat be the
power and authority of his bischop. And to conclude, lyk as na man at any time
hes been estemit ane Christian, onles he had received the sacrament of
baptism: suay in lykwais, no man in any age betuix Christ and his Apostolis
and Iohne Calvin, hes been estemit ane lauchf^ll minister of the kirk of God,
quha had nocht received power, and authority, be the ordour of preisthed fra
his bischop, as fra him quha had ordinar power to constitut ministers in the
kirk of God. This is sa expres in Goddis word, and suay confirmit be the
authority of all pastouris, quha ever hes flurished in any age, or in any
province, that gif Schir Iohne knox ministers produce ane in the contrar, I
salbe content, like as I have said of befoir, to tyne the haill cause.
Considdering thairfoir that the pasioures of the kirk, hes been constitute the
ane liniallie be the other, we man necessarlie grant contine watiou^ of
ministers, onles we wald allege aganis all true doctrine the kirk at sum time
to have alluterlie expyrit. Thus is cleirlie confirmat be S. Paul, Ephe. 4.
quhair he sais, tha^ Christ hes geuin sum to be apostolis, vtheris to be
prophetis, pairt to be euangelistis, and vtheris in lykways to be pastoures,
and doctoures to the edificatioun and beilding of his kirk continually, unto
the time we be vter^e perfyted [quhilk can nocht be afoir the da^ of judgment
(to the effect we be nocht seduced be every licht doctrine. In the quhilk word
is, he declaris oppin^ie, that Christ will nocht leave his kirk destitute nor
desolat, bot at all time will erect faithful pastoures in it. Thairfoir it is
nocht to be imputit to me, that I only do inquire of zou successioun of
pastoures in zour allegit kirk: in respect the apostole S. Paul. does affirm,
that Christ hes appointed sic successioun in his kirk, and the ancient fatheris
(^uha in ^nderstanding of the scripturis of god apperandlie has nocht been
inferiouris to zow did continually ^se this form of inquisitioun, aganis all
heresies quhilk dot he spring in their days. Ireneus quha does see Policarp the
discipill of Iohne, sayith, Iren. 4. rontra Vale^t. c. 44.
that we au^ht d^w obedience to thais ministers in the kirk, quha have and
their successioun fra the apostolis, ar graciously indewed and adornet be God,
with the spreit of verity conioynet with their pre minent successioun. Bot
vtheruis quha do is decline fra the principal successioun to be haldin and
reput as suspect, not withstanding all thai can allege. Tertullian also writis
in this manner, Tert. de prescrip. Seretic.
I desire their authority to be publiceit and schawin, be vertew of the quhilk
thai do ingyre them selves in the kirk, lat them make manifest the original
ground of their kirk, lat them in lyk manner schaw forth ordinar successioun of
their chief pastoures, and bischoppis. Epiphanius have and all togidder
reherset the chief pastoures and bischoppis of the scit of Rome, subionis their
wordis, saing, lat na man marvel that we do make m^tioun in particular of
every ane, for be this the preeminent iurisdictioun of the kirk is maid
manifest. Epiph. lib. ^. de here is. c. 27.
S. Hiero ^e says, I will disclois unto zou that, quhilk does inuartlie
appear unto me may expedient, to embrace that kirk, quhilk being fundit be
the apostolis, does remane unto this present hour. And quhasoeuer does call
them selves Christianis, Hier. contr^^ Luciser.
noch taking their name from Christ, bot from sum other (as he wald say
Caluinistis or lutheriens) it is out of all controversy, that th^^ do nocht
make any pairt of the kirk of god, b^t the verray sinagoge of the Antechrist. S.
Augustene in lykw^is ^aith, the aggreable and universal consent of diverse
people and nations, the authority foundit with miracles, contine wit and
nurischet with hoip, and corroborat with cheritie doith retene me in the kirk:
as in lik manner, the success^oun of pastouris begun at Petir (to quhome Christ
committit his flok ester his resurrectioun) and co^^ine wit without
interruptioun to this present. Aug. contra epist Maniche^
Thairfoir it is nocht only they quhome ze do call Iesuistis that affirmis ane
continual successioun of pastouris to be necessar in the kirk of God: bot
alsuay S. Paul him self, and the haill ancient fatheris, quha ever hes been sen
the beginning of the kirk, and of it self it is may cleir and evident. For as
the k^rk of God can nocht consist without sacrament is and preching of the word
suay it can nocht consist without lauchfull ministers: and co^seque^etlie as
the kirk ca^ nocht expire at na time suay it ca^ noch the desti^ute of
pastouris: of the quhilk the perpetual successioun is necessarlie de ducit
Th^irfoir ze mo^ appardou^ ws gif we h^uea^d the authority of the apostolis
and ancient fatheris mili^a^t part, do esteem zou as falls prophetis. And
veralie knox, quha at na time did acknawlage in his allegit kirk any
successioun of pastoures, nor confidderit fra quhome his forget authority did
proceid, hes left verray litill esperance to his posterity, and vpspring, that
any successioun should continue any space in it, without ane suddane ruin, and
vter exterminioun. Quhilk apperis to me of may singular probability, it
being consuetit with darkness, and suay with lang process can nocht sustene the
licht. It is thairfoir may expedient, that this imaginat kirk receive and
embrace agane the former darkness, within the quhilk it hes been closed this
thousand and fyuehundreth zeiris bypast, with great peace and tranquillity of
the haill world. As quhair ze say that the apostolis did nocht requeir
successioun: folesche man is it nocht may evidently knawen, that the
Christian religioun at that time did tak the beginning, to wit fra Christ and
the Apostolis. quhow culd it be possibill than, even at the original point
thairof, to schaw any successioun. Gif ze had preuenit all otheris in teaching
the Christian religioun, no man wald have requer it successioun of zois: bot
considdering the Christian religioun, and kirk of God hes been foundet be the
Apostolis, and hes continewit formallie unto this day, ze ar astricted to schaw
fra quhome ze have ordourlie deducit zour doctrine and authority. Quhilk for
samekle as ze can nocht justify, we may easalie collect that ze ar alluterlie
separat from the kirk of God. Thairfoir as apperis, convicted be zour
conscience and the verity it selue, ze confess this zour ansuer rather to be
ane scorn, nor ane direct ansuer, subionand that ze ar able to schau
succes^ioun of pastouris in zour kirk. Now lat the reidar considder this may
erroneous and repugnant writer to him self, quha laitlie in his promiss is hes
may starklie denied any ordinar successiou^ of ministers, to be requirit in
any manner of wais be Christ or his disciplis in the kirk of God: now presently
as inspyrit be sum new Apocalips or reuelatioun, alleg ^ him able to declair
his doctrine procedit from the apostolis be continuatioun of pastouris: be
resson he do is only profes that, quhilk the apostlis professit. Surely, gif
his former ansuer, according to his awin saingis, was rather ane skorne nor ane
direct ansuer, he mon appardoun me gif I e^^eme this his other ansuer, no to be
ane direct ansuer, bot ane direct skorne, because he do is use that quhilk
principally consistis in controversy, as ane sure and ondouted propositio^^,
for co^firmatiou^ of his opiniou^, nocht declara^d, as he was cheiflie
doma^dit, be quhat meanis he ressauit his doctrine fra the apostolis. For gif
he had received it be continual succissioun of lauthfull pastouris (as he
opperis to say) he should have schawin, as was doma^dit of him their
institutiou^, and lineall descense unto his days, Quh ^irfoir it does clearlie
appear that he hes brochs na ansuer, that does in any ways appertene to the
purpos. It is thocht worthy of admiratiou^, that the pastoures of his kirk hes
co^tinewed in all agis, ^ocht leua^d any special memory of them to their
posterity, considdering their may erniflifull diligence in obseruatiou^ of
the co^mandimentis of God, and espetiallie of this precept, incres and
multiply, suay that nane dot hink him appased in his conscience, onles he
posseid tuay or three wives at the leist: and to have f^rther assurance in the
day of judgment euin in the decrepit age (aganis the law of nature bot
according to their enangell) thai do ossociat to thanie sum faithful sist^r of

THE REST OF SCHIR Iohne knox ansuer.
THE s^cund which he req^ireth is that we shall aggre (...) manifest
contradictioun that is amangis principal doctou^^s of our new doctrine and
laite invented euangell. This blaspheamie we remit be gods hand to be
punishet, and yet we wald know what doctrine is that which he terms new. Our
euangell (as be foir is sand) is that same which Jesus Christ be him self and
be his apostles manifest unto the world, as all sic as hear the form of our
doctrine can witness. Petitio principii.
where he desyris ws to agg^^e all controuerseis amangis our teachers: we
ansuer, bona side, that we know no controversy in doctrine, especialie of that
which concern^s mannis saluatiou^, within the realm of scotland: but that all
the preacheours within our kirkes vn^sormelie aggre in doctrine and judgment,
notwithstanding the diversity of gifts. If Master Tyrie wald send ws to
reconciliat all co^trouerseis, that are in germany, and ellis where his secund
petitioun hes no greater reason then had the former. For of god we have no
father charge, but to watch over that f^ocke which is subject unto ws, god hes
reased and appointed ws preacheours to the realm of scotland: in the boundis
whereof if we plant not true doctrine according to the talent committed to our
charge and opon our selves to all kind of erroures, that may infect the flock,
we shall be c^iminall befoir god. But that we are precisely bond to ryn from
cuntrie to cuntrie to aggre all controversies, albeit it were even in the matters
of religioun: we ^ind uo expres commandiment geuin to ws in that behalf, of
our god. And tha^foir we most desire the inspectioun of Maist^r Tyrie his
power be verteu whereof, he may charge was to that panefull trawell* befoir that
we can promi^e obedience. But Master Tyrie, we know, will allegde, that in
writing of his letter their was no such thing in his mind: but that his
meaning was that because we did not aggre fully among ^ure selves in all
heads, thaifoir he wald not be of our kirk. For that in plane wordis he
declares, etc. Now all contentioun laid aside we will desire Master tyrie,
and the rest of his factiu^, deaplie to consider if they be bulder upon a sure
fundatiou^: whill that than have no ne other cause why they oppone theme selves
to the treuth of god, now of his marcie revealed to the world but because that
such as profess that treuth: agg^e not in all heads amongis them selves. we
doma^d then what if they had leued in the days of the apostlis when the
preaching of Christ Jesus was no les odious to the visible kirk: to wit to the
posterity of ar^hon and leui, who then reuled in Jerusalem, then hes the ligh
of the eua^gell been, of late years to that Roman antechrist, and unto such
as leave be his marchandece. Would Master Tyrie (we ask) and his factioun have
refused the euangell, because that in the bosom of the kirk there arose great
controversy, and that in the special heads of religioun? for did not some
boldly affirm in the kirk of Antiochia that onles the gentilis were
circumcised, according to the law of moses, thai culd not be saved, which
doctrine and affirmatioun was moir dangerous, and moir sclanderous in those
dais, then all the controversies that yet ar rissin among such as have
refused the dampnable ways of the Papistrie for ^it concernet the cheaf head of
iustificatioun. And will any yet say that thairfoir the, euangell was not the
glaid tydinges of saluatioun, and they that embrased it treulie, were not the
true members of Jesus Christ? we look that men will be moir moderat, then some
shaw them selves to be, who for certane controversies of far les importance
then that was dare boldly blaspheme the treuth and the professors of the
same, because say they, proprium est hereti^^rum a se inuicem dissentire. That
is, it is proper to heretics to disagre among them selves: which sentence
w^ow ancient that ever it be if it shoud be so vnde^stand as the papist doith:
that is, whosoever disagreis among them selves in matters of religioun, they
ar here^ikis, gif the former sentence (we say) should be so understand, then
shall we accuse mo of heresy than can be excused in any on age from Christ
Jesus to this day. For did not Paul disagre from peter? yea he did so disagre
from him, that he did resist him planelie to his face because that he walked not
according to the right way of the truth of the gospel: thais wei tuo
principal pillars the one appointed to the Jews, and the other to the
gentiles: quhat shall we say of the hot contentioun, which fell betuix Barnabas
and paul* which separated them that befoir were joined in as strate
coniunctioun, as ever were tuo mortal men upon the earth. If master Tyrie and

concern any cheaf head of doctrine, the holy ghost will prove the contrar.
For the one tuitched the conscience of men, concerning the fredome of mea^es,
and the other admissioun of ministers* after that they had ones fallen back
from that functioun: which heads were of greater wecht in those days (as
heitofoir we have said) then any controversy which the Papists ar able to
shaw, to be, or yet to have been betuix us that professes the eua^gell and do
abho^ their abhominationes. farther ressoning of this present we omi^, and will
procead with maistre Tyries letter.

THE REFVTATIOVN.
FIrst of all I will adduce ane resson, quhilk may be able nocht only to braik
down, and ourethraw zour weak and sklender presumptionis foundit upon colored
meanis, and mier coniectur is* bot alsuay quhilk may justly move any man, to
lichtlie and reject zour haill doctrine, considder and zour discrepance in the
chief mysteries, and essential points of our faith. As amangis the rest,
lather and his followars affirmis real presens of the body of Christ in the
sacrament of the alter* the Zuinglianis on the other part only admittand ane
sign and figure: Calvin and Ze follouis another preciselie the ane, nor the
other opiniou^, Calvin 4 instit. c. 17. sect 12 and 13.
bot sum pha^tasticall and mo^struous imaginatioun like unto them boith Quha
alltogidder allegis zour selves professouris of the word of god, and in
semblable manner, all eua^gelistis, ever crya^d forth with ane accord, the
scriptures to be may patent and manifest, reject and all constitutioun and
ordinance of the kirk, and to conclude, euerilk ane persuading him self to be
verelie inspyred with the halie gaist. Heirfoir seeing Zou to have certan
propositionis as fundament and gr^und of zour religioun, quhairin ze do all
consent, and thairfray collect and may co^trarious and repugnant conclusions,
it doith necessarlie follow zour ground and foirsaid propositionis quhairin ze
do aggre, to be may erroneous: in respect of sure and ondoutet premissis, the
co^clusioun m^o follow of the lyk fors and strenth. Quhairbie any man may
easalie consider zour clokit religioun, and forgit inue^tionis, onles he be (as
ze) alluterlie addicted to his a win found fantasies and friuolus
imaginations, or other wais wors deprauat. And to enter forther in the matter,
Carolstadius hauea^d forsak in the catholic and Christian religiou^ and
embraced the heresy of luther, being no les ambitious and couatous of gloir
nor his master, he culd nocht stand content, until he had forget thait may
pernicious and abominabill error quhilk ze do presently follow in the
sacrament of the altar. Now I wald domand quhat marvelous and singular zeall of
religiou^, and haelie scripture, doith move zow to affirm Carol stadius to be
follow it rather than luther* gif Carolstadius does allege him to teach the
sincere word of god, suay dois luther in lykmaner: gif Carolstadius approuis
him self to be ane extraordinar propheit, in lykmaner lutharis wocatioun is
extraodanr. Ze will perchance say Carolstadius being forther illuminat, hes
mair fullelie understand the scriptures nor luther: gif ze in scotland do
adhere to that opinioun, the germans quha beleuis them selves in no part
inferior to zow, geuis the lyk prerogaetiue and perfectioun preeminent to
luther, Thairfoir we will fall in our former questioun, quhether gif in
discrepans of religioun, the decisioun should be referrit to the germans, or left
to zow in scotland. ze will perauentour cast in, that the matter cummand amanges
zow to ressoning* micht be way of argument receive the just decisioun. ^s it
nocht may notorious^e known, that d^ring the very time of luther this matter
was deducet in c^ntrouersie, and earnestfullie ressonit the space of fourtene
zearis, without any determinat sentence: and after luther his discipill
uestphalus aganis zour master Calvin did prosecute the same rather eik and the
controversy nor makand any aggreable decisioun thairof. Thairfoir, gif ze beir
any great afectioun, or fervent zeall to the verity, ze may easalie espy ane
just cause to repel and reject sic pastouris quha being destitute of all
ordinar power, hes na other ground nor fundame^t of their religione, bot their
owin brane. we say th^n no les bauldlie nor treulie tha^t dois remane
constantly in the catholic k^rk, that be resson of the ondou^ed ground, and
sure fundamentis of our faith we all condescend in ane sentece, nocht only
presently in our days, bot in lyk manner acknawlegeing with the ancient
fatheris (quha be ane lang space hes preced^th ws) that sincere, and ondoutet
kirk quhilk cl^irlie we understand to be gouern^t, and pres^^uet be the holy
goist, as ane stark pillar* and sure gro^d of verity: firmly aproua^d that
quhilk the k^rk proponis to be beleuit, and co^damnand that quhilk it declaris
to be contrar, and repugnant to the intergritie of the true faith and
religioun. ^n all other matters, sa far as the kirk doithe nocht establis any
sentence in a^her of the parts, reserues liberty to quhatsueuer person, to
believe frellie thairin as he will.

Quhair ze ansuer zour enjoined iurisdictioun of teching of the word of God, to
be limitat within the realm of scotland, and nocht extendet to foronars, I
wald may affectio^slie domand (...) zow to discl is and oppin, be quhais
iniunctioun have ze receauet thi^ commandiment, considering in the four
euangellis non sic commandiment can be found. Bot para^e^tur ze will seik
recurss to the fyst eua^gell, as ane co^mou^ place to the rest of zour
doctrine* The kirk c^ld noch ^n any w^^s inione the lyk precept to Zou
espetialie it benig, as ze say invisible. Bot suppois it had been co^ma^dit to
zou, zit zear obleist to profes no doctrine discrepant from the doctrine of the
kirk: than I say that of force ze mon affirm the opinionis of luther-quhilk in
essential matters of religioun ar repugnant to zou, to be annullet and
co^damned, as may wicked heresies, or else to condamnez our self. Bot ze apper
and lie dar nocht co^descend in nane of thois sentences, another declar^nd them
as true Christianis nor zit afirma^d them as herety kis: albeid they with
greatar liberty as appears, and mair frelie, does call zou nocht only
heretikis, and falls prophetis, bot alsuy ambitious and alluter lie deprauat
Consider quhat luther does wreit agains Bucerus ane of zour factiou^: thais
miserable personis (says he) do nocht stand in any sort content, hauea^d
scatterit their venenous doctrine in ane infinite number of their a win buikis,
^utherus epi ^ola ad Her ^agiu.
onles they infect the buikis of vtheris with the same. And in ane other
epistoll, exhortes the Marquis of Ba^rdeburg, to permit on na ways in his
landis and Iurisdictioun, Epistola ad Marchi Bra^leb.
sic as followis zour doctrine* Vestphalus the disciple of luther says, that
sic as profesis zour religioun meri^ is rather to be punished be the power and
authority of the magistrate, nor to be confutet be disputatioun or writing of
buikis. Considder in lykmaner quhat ^e'anc^hon d^ith rehers of Carostaldius,
quh^ was the first author of zour herosie^ Carolstadi^^ (sais he) ane man cled
with all inciuilitie, Melanch. de ^ena domini.
and almaist weild withouting yne, without letters, zea euin without the
co^moun (...) of nature alluterlie ^estitut of al humanity, did start wp, and
imbring this presens tumult and controversy, in quhome dois evidently regne
all wicked operations, tending to may grievous impieti, as quhair he hes
embraced the verray doctrine of the Anabaeptistis. Of the quhilk it is easalie
to perceive, the great repugnance and ^o^trarietie in essential matters of
religiou^, betuix zou and the rest of the prophetis quhilk ar rissin in their
may miserabill days, notwithstanding that ze have all the lyk fun^ damentis
of religioun, the Lyk instinctioun of the halie gaist, and the lyk ext^aordinar
vocatioun.

Bot ze allege in the primitive hirk sindrie heresies to have stertup* as
quhair Paul did resist unto Peter. And in lyk wais, as the controversy of
religioun betuix Barnabas and S. Paul: albeid no man thairfoir culd have had
any just cause to have denudeth and separat him self from the kirk.

Co^troue^ sies ni did may befall nithe kirk, bot quhow often soever they
happin, the kirk at no time is destitute of ^ugis, be quhome with all
expeditioun they may be decydet. Quhilk we observe to have been done may vi
gilantlie be the apostolis: as quhen the controversy tuitching the
obseruatioun of the law did vpspring, they permittit nocht to every man to
decerne after his a win pha^tasie, bot reserved the determinatioun and
decisioun to them, quha was appointed be god thairto: that is, t^ the
pastoures of the kirk, to quhome be the ordinance of God, the rest of the
multitude was obleist and bound to obey: Bot in zour sinagoge their be ane
infinite number of controversies, aluterlie destitute of all Judge: in respect
every ane is accoustumet, to in^ erpret the scripture as his opinioun do is
leid him, and as every man be author of his awin religioun, suay does
constitute him self Judge in all occurrand controu^rseis: quhilk clearlier
apperit be experience, nor that it dois mister any probatiou^. Heirfoir it is
evident and cleir, that no sic thing hes been in the primitive kirk, nor at any
time in the kirk of ^od, as we see dalie in zour synagoge. As quhair ze zay,
that Peter did err in the faith, it is may erroneous: for Christ prayt for
him that his faith should on na wais decay, and zit ze ar so impudent to affirm,
that the sone culd nocht obtene fra the father that quhilk he domandet.
Tertullian sais, that their was na spot, Tert. de con^rip. hereti.
nor error of fath in Petir, bot of conuersatioun) as he dois call it) for he
doithe know the vocatioun and calling of the Gentiles to the Euangell: and the
ceremonies of the Iewis nocht to have been in any wiis at that time necessar,
nevertheless during ane schort space to have been ^olerabill* Galat. 2.
quhair by the synagoge of the Iewis micht have been zirdit with honor: to the
end that he apperit nocht, to constitute the Idolatry of the Gentiles, in the
lyk preeminence and degree with the religioun of the Iewis. Bot because
necligentlie he substrakit him self fra the gentiles, quhom with of befoir he
was at the tabill, he was reprochit be S. Paul: in respect he apperet to
diverse, to approve the observation of the law as necessar. Be the quhilk
occasioun Saint Paull ^ppinlie refusit to circumcide Titus, because
opportunity of time and place did nocht in any wais serve, onles he had fallin
(...) the like vice in the quhilk Petir did fall, and be his exemple had
persuader to money, the circumcisioun to be all^terlie necessar. Bot gif Saint
Paul had nocht considderit the circumstan^es, and had circumcidet Titus he had
falit nocht I say in any error of the faith, bot necligentlie geuand otheris
occasioun of sklander, as to bel^ue the obseruatioun of the law to have been
necessar. Sic was the faill of Peter, because he was nocht circumspect to
co^sidder the sklander quhilk culd enseu* Quhairf^ir, in thu pairt, dois only
appear zour ignorance, that ze can nocht discern betuix ane falt in manners,
and in faith* for ze can put no reproach to the fayrh of Petir in this behalf,
onles ze prove, that Saint Petir beleuit the obseruatioun of the auld
ceremoneis of the law, to have been necessa^ as than, quhilk ze will never be
able to do.

Bot in did ze had mister of sum good argument, quhen ze brocht this exemple
of Paul and Barnabas, quhilk seruis no thing at all to zour propose. First
because their was no dissentioun betuix them, concerning the faith or
religioun, bot only of a matter particular, and of litill wecht: to wit, gif it
was expedient in the great voyage quhilk thai were to make, to tak Saint Marc,
in their cumpanie, quha had left them of befoir in cypre apperandlie because he
was onhabill to endure the travel quhilk thai bayth sustenit. Act. 15.
Secundlie g^ue and, that be^uix Paull and Barnabas their hade been debait or
controversy in religioun, zit at that present no certane decisioun of sic
controversy was in the kirk of God, suay that it was lesum to every ane of
them, to follow his a win judgment in that part. Bot after the decisioun and
determinatioun of the kirk, ze can nocht be able to schaw any debait, or
questioun, other betuix the Apostlis, or any other lauchfull pastouris that
ever hes hene after them. Treulie it is ane matter worthy of admiratioun, gif
Petir [as ze allege] did err in the faith, and Saint Paul or Barnabas in
lykmaner, nocht withstanding they were Apostolis ma^st surely indewed, and
illummat with the spreit of God: that ze and zour ministers, dois so cleirlie
comprehend the mysteries of God, and the richt intelligence of the scriptures,
that quhatsume^er zesay, ze will that it be est^mit, and iugit, as the sinceir
word of the God. Gif zour impudenci^ be great, or nocht to vsurp, mair to zour
s^lu^, norze attribute to (...) ^r Paull, I leif the judgment to the reidar.

THE LETTER.
QVhair foir schir considdering that in that kirk, in the quhilk I am be the
grace of God their is continual successiou^ of doctrine, and that same self
quhilk is preached now, hes been teached in all agis, as it is manifest to any
man that hes red all ancient writtars afoir our times. And moirour I find it
spread throw all the world, as in lykmaner it is manifest and the experience
dois teache zou, for ze will cum to na place quhair Christis doctrine is
ressauit, bot ze will find the religioun at the leist in money personis.
Q^harfoir gifz^ can nocht schaw in na other religioun the samyng, it followis
necessarlie that na other religioun is the true religioun.

THE REST OF SCHIR IOHNE knox ansuer.
TO this epiloge and argument gadderit thairof, we ansuer only this: ^^nis
Asi^s est hom^ ^a^nis knox (...) a^inns, (...) Ioannes ^nox est h^mo e^ fals^
no^ potest (...) qui verum^ ergo knox vel no^ est mo vel est (...) nus.
that of a manifest lie, their can no treuth be co^cludet. His manifest and
impudent lie we say, is, that he affirms that in that kirk in the which he is,
is their* continual successiou^ of doctrine* and that the selue same which is
preached now, hes been taught in all agis. This we affirm is a most impudent
lie. For now, and o^ lait years. id has been taughr and the people received,
that the mess was a sacrifice propitiatory for the synni^ of the quick and
the dead: that the Pape was the head of the kirk* and such other heads of
most heretical dotrine, approved in the papisticall kir^* which heads we
affirm were unknown in the agis of the Apostoils, or yet of the fathers that
immediately followed them. And for the probatiou^ thairof we desire their
writtingig to be producet, ever beginning at them quho were appointed of god,
to preach, and to plane the verity in the world. we are nocht bound to credit
quh at soever the fathers have spoken: but our faith (as is befoir said) is
builded upon the sure rock Jesus Christ, Ephe. (...)
ad upon the fundatioun of the apostlis, and prop^^etis. So far as any fatheris
aggres their with, we reuerenthe do embrase it but if the fathers have affirmed
any thing without the warrant of the writtin word of the eternal our god, to
whose only voce the sheap of his pasture ar bound: it is as laughful to ws, to
reject that which proceadeth from man and not from god, as is easy to ^hame to
affirm it. Sed perper* intellactis.
Master Tyrie may know that we use the words of the aucientis.

THE REFVTATION.
IT is said in the commun proverb, ane liar should be of good memory in the
beginning of zour buke, ze affirmet the sacrifice of the Mess to have been
received of auld in the papisticall kirk, now be the contrar, ze allege it to
be of lait days inuentit. Bot that zour impude^cie be knawe^ and manifest to
all men, I will adduce the plane, and sure testimonies of the may ancient
fathers, that ever hes been in the kirk of God as concerning thais tua heads,
quhilkis inspe^iall above the rest, apperis to zou to be destitute of all
probatioun. And to begin at the bischop of Rome, quhome we affirm to be the
successor of S. Petir quha was head and principal of the Apostol^.

Christ sa^eth unto Peter, thou art Peter* and upon this rock I will build my
kirk* ^sath. 16.
In the quhilk word is he orda ned Peter the fundatioun or heid of his kirk:
unto him he deliuerit the keys of the kingdom of heuin, and committed unto
him after his resurrectioun his scheape to be fed: sua that their is no scheip
of Christ quhilkis ar nocht also the scheip of Peter, a^ sais S. Bernard. ^an.
21.
The ministers quha thi^ kis nocht them selves, comprehendit under the name of
thais scheip, quhilkis Christ comendit to petir, mo^ confess that thai ar
nocht the scheip of Christ: otherwais gif thai will be the s^heip of Christ, let
them obey Peter, and him that does succeid Peter in his office. Now because
the present co^t^^uersi^ is quhou thais wordis of the scripture aucht to be
understand, in the quhilk Christ co^mit^it has flock to Peter* lat ws co^sidder
in quhat manner the p^stours, and doctures of the kirk ever s^n the days of the
Apostolis, hes interpreted them. And to begin at S Paul^s a win discipill S
Dionise quha in his buke de diuinis nominibus, affirms Peter to be the heid
of all the Apostolis. ^io. c. 3. ^iuin. nom.


Anacletu^, ^n^c. epist. 3.
quha was in the Apostols time* says that the holy Roman Apos^olicall kirk,

says to Peter, thou art Peter, etc. Thairfo^r this Apostolical kirk, is maid
the head of other kirkes, by God, and by none other.

sic authority for all men did know, and confess, that he had authority to

offer only sacrifice unto him, quha is the God of the martyris [albeid we
offer in memory of thame] because we are the preistis of God and nocht of the
martyris. The caluinistis in their kirk dois another permit altaris, preistis*
sacrifice, nor memory of martyris. Of the quhilk it is manifest, that it is

In the forsaid council we find it decreated in this manner. It is adducet

the quhilk another decreit, nor consuetude doith approve, that they quha on

chief and principal pairt of this sacrifice, consistis in the consecratioun of
the body and blude of Christ, the pastoures and Doctouris of all agis, nocht
only believed may assuredly, the true and natural body of our Saluioure to
be in the sacrament of the altar, bot also of that, as ane may sure and
certane ground, doith proif other mysteries of our faith, quhen thai were in
controversy, as quhen in the time of Ireneus it was affirmed be sum, that our
bodies quhilkis of their awin natuir were mortal, and subject to corruptio^n,
culd on na way be maid immortal. Iren. 4. con.
The forsaid doctor did ansuer in this manner, ^eres c. 34.
our bodies (says he) be (...) of the coniunctioun of the body and blood of
Christ in the sacrament, quhilk is ar immortal, ar in lyken (...) maid
capabill of immortality. ^^f wenaus, and the fatheris of that age had believed
as the Caluinistis dois now, this argument hid been alluterlie vane and of na
strenth, as it is easy to ^uerie man to perceive in lykmaner, quhen Martion
did profes ane may wicked and balspheamous heresy, aganis the incurnatioun
of our Saluiour, affirmand him nocht to be ane man in very deide, Tert. 4.
cont.
bot only be external appearance: Tertulliun to preif that he was aue man as
we are, Martionem.
and composed of flesche and blood as we did argument suay, Christ sais he
gave his blood to his disciplis in the letter suppar, blood can nocht proceid
bot from ane true body, chairfoir Christ hade ane true body, and was ane
verray man.

Esterwart, quhen Areius denied the sone of God to be consubstantiall with the
father, the catholic men did object that place of the Euangell quhair Christ
says, Johan. 10.
I and the father ar ane: of the quhilk thai collected the sone to be
consubstantiall to the father. The Arrianis did ansuer, that na thing culd be
collected of that place contrar to their opinioun, interpreting the father and
the sone to be ane, nocht as concerning nature, bot be mutual luf and
cheritie, lyk as we all ar ane with Christ. then the catholict men did reply,
as testifies Hylarius, that we are conioned with Christ, Hylar. 8. de ^rinitate.
nocht only be lufe and cheritie, bot also substantiallie and corporally, be
the participatioun of his body and blood in the sacrament, quhairthrow the
impudency of Ioh^e Calvin and his ministers is easalie perceived.

In lykmaner, quhen Nestorius begouth to blaspeme our Saluiour Christ Jesus,
say and, that he was only, ane man, and in nawais God, the halie, and
catholict fathers, does resson aganis him in this manner, as testifies Cyrillus
Alexandrinus. In the dalie sacrifice of the kirk, Cyril epi. ad Nestorium.
we receive the flesch of Christ, nocht as a comoun flesch, nor zit as the
flesch of him in quhome God did duel, as in ane tabernacle, bot as flesch
conioned with the divinity: vtherwais it culd nocht have strenth, to quicken
and viuificat our bodies, Johan. 6.
according to Christis awin saing. quhlik is so cleir and manifest, that the
heretykis their selves dois gif ws sufficient testimony their of, Luther in
ane of his epistolis says, that the haill world with ane accord afoir their
seditious men, Luth. epi. ad Marchio.
believed the true and natural body of our Saluiour to be in the sacrament,
Bra^deburg.
suay that it is na les impiety to trow vtherwais, nor to condamne the hall
kirk of God and Christ him self and his apostolis of may wicked and
abominable heresy. And in ane other place he writtis in this manner: Idem in
epi ad fratres Argent.
gif Carolstadius, sais he or any other, culd have prouen unto me, in the
sacrament of the altar to be only breid and wine, he wald done me ane greit
plesour, because thairthrou I did easalie understand, that I micht have done
greit damage to the Papistrie, bot after greit labouris quhilk I have bestowet
in that matter, Philipi: M^lanch. in esstola ad frdericum M^cenium.
I find my self bound and captive, because the text of the scripture is sa
plane, and manifest, that it can na wais be thrawin to no other sense. Quhilk
also is confirmet be Philip Melanc, hon, I know, sais he, I will appeir verray
dule and of sober judgment to su^ me^, because I do nocht interpreit the wordis
of our sal, uiour, Hoc est corpus meum, be ane trop or ane figure, bot treulie
sais he, gif liberty be anis granted, to interpreit the scriptures be sic
tropis or figuris according to our fantasy, we sall never be assured of the
true sense and intelligence thairof, as he deducis verray weill be sindrie
exemplis, and efterwart he concludis in this manner: as to me, to follow fic ane
opinione, quhilk of lait is invented be Carolstadius, ane may ungodly, and
wicked man aganis so manifest scriptures, and the universal consent of the
kirk of God, quhilk ever hes been afoir ws, I can have na assurance in my
conscience. suay to return to our purpois, I believe that no man is so blind,
that dois nocht perceive first zour impudency, and secundlie that the
sacrifice of the Mess hes ever been in the kirk of God, sen it ^egouth. Bot
apperandlie ze wald play with ws fast and lous, for albeid ze require the
testimoneis of the fathers to be producet, zit ze say, ze will gif them no
credence, bot insafar as as thai ar conform to the word of God: euin as zour
brane were ane infallible reul thairof, that quhat sumeuer ze imaginat or dreme,
nocht withstanding it be contrar to the universal consent of the haill world,
zit because it procedis of zou, it aucht to be embraced as the word of God. Bot
to the effect zour iuglarie he ^nderstand, I will oppin and manifest that
quhilk deceaues zou, and the rest of zour ministres, coucerning the authority
of the ancient fatheris of the kirk. we acknawlege the fatheris to have been
men as ze do, and that they micht have fall^n in sindrie kind of errouris, lyk
as at sumtyme they have fallin: albeid, because they did, at all times continue
them selves within the Catholic kirk, their errouris culd on na wais ingendre
any prejudice to their saluatioun. Bot quhair we do use their authorities for
confirmatioun of our faith, we adduce them only as witness to ws, of that
religion quhilk the catholic kirk during their time did embrace. Suay of
necessite ze ar constranit, other to deny, that to be the true kirk quhilk they
did acknawlage: or to embrace that doctrine quhilk in their time the true and
catholic kirk embraced. As be exemple, Ireneus testifies, that in his time the
sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ was offerit throucht the haill
world, suay dois testify Iustine martyr. Iren. 4. c. 34.
And to pretermit the rest. S. Augustene in ane thousand places. Just. de dial.
c. Tripho.
Gif ze permit nocht sic sacrificies to be offeret in zour kirk, Aug. in epist.
33. and lib. 20. contra Faust. c. 38.
it is necessar to zou to confess, that S. Augustene did nocht acknawlage the
true kirk, nor the rest of the fathers in lykmaner cited of befoir. De ciuit.
lib. 10. ca. 6. and. 20.
Thairfoir we use their testimoneis, as ane necessar argument to be certifiet
of that faith and religioun, quhilk ever hes been taucht in the kirk of God sen
it begouth, quhilk we do according to S. Paulis counsall, quha says, that
Christ hes geuin his doctors and pastouris, to the effect we be nocht seduced,
and allured with every licht doctrine, quhilk ze on the other pairt will
nawais acknawlage, every ane excogitane to him self ane new form of
religioun, contar to that quhilk has been establischet be the universal
consent of all nations. and may cleielie expressed in the word of God.

THE REST OF KNOX ansuer.
IT appears to ws be the hole progres of Master Tyries letter, that he and
his factioun can acknowledge no kirk, which in all ages hes not been visible to
the eyes of men having lykwais a visible successiou^. For first he affirms,
that the kirk, whereof the propheit Isaias speaks, should be manifest and
visible through all the world. And hear last he allegeth, that we can cum in
no place where we sall not find that religioun spread: at the least in money
persons. And thairof he co^cludes, that if we can not prove the like of our
religioun: it followis that it is not the true Religioun,

If Maiste^ Tytie recant not this assertioun, he must correct his creed. And
where vniuerselly before we use to say cred^ sanctam ecclesia^ etc He must say
(...) sancta^ ecclesiam. For if their be no kirk upon the face of the earth,
but that which is visible, than vane it were to us to say* I believe the holy
kirk universal: but conside^rlie we might affirm, I see the holy kirk. If
Master Tyrie will say we may both se and beliue, and be our sight our faith
may be strenghned. For Thomas saw the wondes in the handis, feat, and side of
Christ Jesus and beleue^ and so may we se the kirk and yet believe it. If we
should grant so far to Master Tyrie, yet were his argument nothing helped. For
the questione is not whether that we may notify those things that we are bound
to believe. But the questioun is, if that we are not bound to believe those
things, which somtymes ar vterlie removed from the external senses of men.
Master Tyrie will acknowledge no kirk except that which hes been, and is
visible* we in the contrare, acknowlegde and reuera^^^ the spous of Christ
Jesus, Apoc. 12.
somtymes exyled from the (...) receiving somtymes the wings of an egle that
she may fle to the wyldernes: where of God and not of man, she has her place
prepared. we reverence her which does complane, that she has been desolat,
barrane, a (...) and a va^derar to and fro. That spous of Jesus Christ (...) so
lytill of her successioun, Isai. 49.
visible to man's ey^^, that she is roft in admiratioun who should have
nurished her childrene during the time of her baniueme^t. Esa. 49.
If Master Tyrie be so well seen in the ancient writters, as in his writting
he would shaw him self to be, then can he not be ignorant, that it is not
without great cause that the holy goist has taught ws to say: I believe the
holy kirk universal. To wit because that oftentimes it is, that the kirk (...)
is so afflicted: yea, the beauty thereof is so obscured to the most part of
the world, that the synagoge of Satan usurps the title of the tieu kirk: and
Babilone is preferred to Herusale^. So that the elect ar compell^d to complane
and say we se our owen signs, now is their no propheit any moir among ws Let
the days of Helias, and his complent witness, whether that the kirk of God is
always so visible, that it may be pointed forth whith the singer of man Thus
we wreit schortlie to gif occasion to Master Tyrie, and to such as ar blinded
with that error, more deaply to considder that artickle of their believe, and
not so rashely to condemn such as God of his mercy calis from darkness to
light. Now to the rest of his litter.

THE REFVTATION.
HEir I pray the readar to considder dilige^tlie this inu^sible kirk of Schir
Iohne knox, be the quhilk he is constrani^ to grant, that the Doctors and
pastouris cited of be^soir, dois naway appertene to the kirk of God: for it is
may certane that that kirk, quhilk they acknawleges was visible, and manifest
to the world. Morower the kirk to be invisible it is may erroneous and
repugnant to all scriptures: for quhat can be more manifest and clier, Isai. 60.
nor that, quhilk of befoir was cited of Isaias the ports of the kirk sall
ever be patent both nicht and day. And that, quhilk almaist all the prophets
with ane v^ce dois testify, Daniel. 2.
that the kingdom and inheritance of Christ* salbe mair triumphand and
glorious, Psall. 88.
nor ever was any empire or kingdom afoir him, Psalm. 93.
and that it sall continue in the former magnificence, to the end of the world.
Bot Sr. Iohne knox, of lait illuminat be sum new ent husiasme or reuelatioun,
will be the contrar, that Satan his master posseid all visible kingdoms,
nations citeis, and that Christ for his inheritance hes reserved only to him
self, ane invisible kingdom. Christ in lykwais the ondoubted fundatour of his
awin kirk sp^ik and to his apostolis, quhome he had constitute and ordanit
pastoures their of, schaweth the same to be visible at all time, saying, ane
city situat upon ane montan can nocht be onknawen or hid, Math. 5.
thairby willing his apostolis, and pastors to schene euin as ane bricht
mirror to vtheris in the verity, as being constitute in sic preeminence, and
prerogative above the rest, quhair they culd nocht at any time be onknawen, and
thairfoir he dois call them the licht of the world. Quhilk words in respect
they ar justly referret to the pastors, we do co^sequentlie imbring that the
pastors being knawe^ the kirk necessarlie man be visible: and as the licht can
nocht be in the darkness, suay the pastors of the kirk can nocht be invisible.
He testifies alsuay, that na man does licht ane lantern, putting it under ane
firlot bot in ane cha^dler, to the effect the haill house may have licht: suay
gif the euangell of Christ be the lantern, be verteu of the quhilk the haill
world is illuminat, gif the kirk this money hundredth zeris has remanit
invisible, Christ has collocat his euangell under ane firlot, quhik to allege,
is ane may abominable impiety, and repugnan^ to Christ him self. He says
alsuay, gif any man offend zou, accuse him to the kirk: than he supposed his
kirk necessarlie to be visible. And as this precept and command of Christ, can
nocht expyre afoir the end of the world, Math. 18.
suay ever to the end of the world his kirk mon be visible. Moreower, in the
fundatioun and beilding of it he certifies ws, that on naways it salbe
suppressed or ourcu^ be any manner of tribulatiou^ or persecution, quhik the
experience it self dois may fullelie declair: for in the grievous and
horribill persecutionis of nero, Math. 16.
Domitianus, Decius, Diocletianus, and the rest, his kirk nocht only was nocht
obscured, or in any way invisible, but be the contrar mair declarie and
publised to the world, in safar that Diocletianus and Maximinianus, throch
desperatioun that they culd nocht exterminat, Niceph. li. 7. c. 20.
and abolisse the name of Christ, deposit their empyris, suay that we may
justly affirm with all christian men that hes been afoir ws. zonaras inuita
Dioclet.
Sanguis martyrum semen ecclesiae. Satan zonr master be this assault perceive
and him self of les strenth, nor that he culd euert the house of God, did
excogitatat ane other assault, na les dangerous and heavy to the pure flock of
Christ, that because he culd nocht bring thamefra the professioune of the name
of Christ, to may abominable Idolatry, he did call up to him self sum
extraordinar prophetis lik zou, quha in deid were alluterlie separat from
Christ, bot in external appearance, apperit to be Christianis, to the effect,
that mair easalie the pure, and simpill people, under the pretext of the name
of Christ, micht be seduced. Sic extraordinar prophetis hes been callit
heretikis, as we do call zou for the present, bot the house of God, is sa weill
beilded, and upon ane sa firm and sure ground, that this assalt of Satan,
quhou dangerous that ever it be, may na mair nor the former assault. For as
testifies Saint Paul, heresies ar permitit, to the effect that they, quha ar
prouin be maid manifest: as he wald say, that be heresies the kirk is mair
illustrat, and the verity is mair tryet, and notoriously declaret unto the
world. Quhilk in lykmaner, is confirmit be be experience of all agis. To begin
at Simon Mag (...), to Martin Luther and Iohne Calvin. And in did we may love
and glorify God, that for correctioun of his kirk, he hes permittit sic
heresies as we sec to rise in our days: for nocht only be them, the Catholic
kirk is on na ways ourcum, nor the verity obscured that it is maid mair cleir
and evident, nor ever it was afoir. For as to the multitude of Christian men,
it is gretumlie incressed sen Luther begouth to preche his fist Euangell, as
concerning doctrine and eruditioun, alsueill in scripturis as in histories
antiquittes, and all kind of writtars: It is sa flurish* and in the Catholic
kirk for the present, that: gif we wald compair their days with thais in the
quhilkis Luther begouth, for ane that was any way lernit, we are able to produce
ane thou sand. As to correctioun of manners [to pretermit ane i^finet number of
them quha from their Idolatry ar conuertit to the faish of Christ in sindrie
cuntrais quhair the name of Christ was nocht afoir acknawlegit we see sic
reformatioun of all kind of estait, that we have greit occasioun to love and
glorify God of his benefits. As concerning the religioun now professit be the
Catholic kirk, it is satryed be deductioun of all agis, histories, vritters,
to be that same self religioun, quhik ever hes been embraced be Christian men,
sen they begouth, that na man, quha is nocht alluterlie reprobat, or blindit in
his awin fantasies, dar deny it. Suay we may easalie perceive, that the force
and strenth of Satan, sall never be able to ourthraw the house of God, nor his
ministeris the lauchfull pastouris of the kirk. Quhairthrou it is may cleir,
that the kirk of God, lyk as it was visible quhen it was foundet be Christ, and
be his Apostolis, suay in dispyte of Satan and all his acco^plesis, quhou
great that ever their vproir or thundering be, sall roman visible to the end
of the world. and the spous of Crist sall ever be able to sing the triumphand
and glorius sang of the quhilk David makis mentioun in her person. Saepe
expugnauerunt me a iuuentute mea, Chrs. in Is^ homil. 4.
etenim non potuerunt mihi. Thairfoir the halie and glorious Doctor
Chrysostom says, that it is easier the sone to be private, Aug. in epis* Ioa^.

and destitute of licht, nor the kirk to be onywais obscurit. S. Augustene
alsuay, quha ever says he dois no^ht see the kirk, he is blind. And in ane vth
r^place, the propheitis, says he, hes spoken ^air cleirlie of the kirk nor of
Christ, Ide^ in Psa 30.
because thai knew be the spreit of Prophecy, that amangis them quhasuld
profes the name of Christ* their was to be money controuerseis of the kirk, and
for that cause, that na man should be begylit in sa wechtie a matter, thai did
speik sa cleirlie of it* And albeid the prophetis had nocht forspoken sa
evidently, that the kirk at all time should be visible, nor zit Christ him self,
nor his apostolis had left sa certa^e and ^ndoubted testimony thairof: nocht
withstanding the kirk of it selfis of sic nature, that it is nocht possible,
that it be ordourlie contine wit and conseruit, onles it be in all agis
visible. First because it is requisite to the conseruatioun of the kirk
(considdering it is composed of mortal men) that sum men quha did nocht of
befoir appertene unto it, adione them thairto: than I domand quhow can it be
possible, that in all age their be sum quha do adione them to the kirk, onles
in all age it be visible. More ower, it is requisite in lykmamer that the
pastors of the kirk have sum power and ordour, be the quhilk they may be
acknawlegit as lauchfull ministers: gif the kirk at any time had been
invisible, it followis necessarli^ that the ministers, quha dois immediately
succeid thairefter, because they have nocht ressauit their power and authority
be the kirk (considdering it was as than invisible) be destitute of all
authority of lauchfull pastoures, suay that na man can be bound or obleist be
the law of God, to obey them, of the quhilk the extreme ruin and exterminione
of the kirk dois necesserlie follow. And to be schort I wald domand, gif zour
kirk, this money hundredth zearis: hes followit, and embraced that manner of
wirschiping of God, and administratione of sacramentis, quhilk the catholic
kirk, or as ze call it the papisticall kirk, hes followit or nocht. Gif ze
ansuer, that it hes followit sic manner of wir schining of God as the Catholic
kirk. then I collect necessarlie that zour haill kirk was composet of
hypocritis, that is, of them quha exterio^ lie professit ane religione, and in
wartlie ane other, and suay it culd nocht be the kirk of God. because in our
belief we say, I believe the catholic kirk. Gif ze ansuer that zour kirk hes
wirschiped God in ane other manner, that is, as ze do now, and follow it the lyk
administratione of sacramentis as ze do: than I collect necessarlie, that it
was visible: because it is nocht possible, that in ane assembly or
congregatione of men, they be diverse manners of worschiping of God, and of the
administratione of Sacrame^tis, onles the ane pairt be knawin to the other:
suay of necessity they aucht bayth to be visible. I pretermit, that in all
contrais quhair the name of Christ ever hes been professit, their is historeis
may faythfullie contenand the beginning, course, and continual progres of the
kirk, euin unto this present aige: bot quhow any historical narratioun culd
have correspondit to ane inuisibll kirk, I can nocht full alie perceive. As to
the authority of the ancient fatheres, pastoures, councels, or assembleis of
Christian men as said is, be ane universal consent they confirm this to be
true: in safar, that all the ministers of the world, can nocht be able to
produce ane in the contrar, quha in any aige hes been estemit as ane lauchfull
pastor of the kirk. Math. 5.
This is the true city collocat on the montan, quhilk can nocht behid. This is
the bricht lantern, quhilk can nocht be put onder ane firlot, this is, the
tabernacle of Christ, Psalm. 18.
collocat nocht in the darkness bot in the sone. Psalm. 62.
This is the house of God, in the quhilk magnisicens and halines or to be found,
euin to the end. Lat zou nocht heirfoir sa gretumlie be abused, in zour awin
fantastical imaginations, as to believe that quhilk is repugnant to sa
manifest scriptures, and cleir testimoneis of the may ancient fathers: and to
conclude contrar to the universal consent of the haill world afoir zour zou.
Bot perchance Schir Iohne knox hes fum demonstratione, or necessar argument, be
the quhilk he is mouit to say the kirk to be invisible, thairfore I thocht
expedient to adduce his resson, and motive in that part: we believe, says he,
the kirk to be catholic, thairfoir it is inuisibill. Thus is ane argument
treulie may subtle and strenthie, be the quhilk Schir Iohne knox prouis
necessarlie (gif he prouis any thing) that his kirk is as z^t invisible. Because
gif he were domandit, quhether gif he beleuis the Catholic kirk or nocht: Gif
he ansueris he beleuis nocht, than he wantis the may chief article of his
belief. Gif he ansuer that he beleuis it, than according to his argument it
followis necessarlie, that it is as zit invisible. Thairfoir he is constranit
to grant that of the forsaid article of the faith, it can be naways prouen the
kirk at any time to be invisible. For quhen the apostoles authoriset, and
setfurth thais articles, they did acknawlege the kirk: Bot gif Schir Iohne knox
had been in thais days, be this argument he wald have necessarlie collected the
contrar, euin aganis the apostolis them selves. Bot to proceid I will declair
the ground quhairupon zour ignorance is foundet. We belief the Catholic kirk,
and nevertheless we see the pastouris of it, we se the external administratioun
of the sacramentis, we see the outwart signs and ceremoneis of religioun. zit
to acknawlege them quha vsis sie exercise of religione, to be the true kirk of
God, and gouernit be his halie spreit, it is necessare we have faith: suay at
all time we believe the halie and Catholic kirk, nocht obstant all exterior
appareill, quhilk is objected to our senses. As for exemple, the heretics
seis evidently the pastour^, quhairof the Catholic kirk consistes, bot in
respect altogether they inlaik the verteu of faith, beleuis it nocht to be the
true kirk: thairfoir necessarlie faith is requeseit to believe the kirk, euin
quhen it is may visible. Nor zit [as ze do may freuolie and falsely
affirm) Thomas believed that quhilk he saw bot that quhilk he saw nocht: he saw
Christ as concerning his humane nature, bot be faith he believed him to be God.
Quhairfoir it is manisest, that zour argument adduced to preif the inuisibilie
of the kirk, is vane and of nastrenth, Quhair ze conclude. the kirk of God to
tak the wingis of ane Egle* and flee in the desert, ze cleirlie declair zour
self ane falls propheit: in respect that Christ hes commandit ws expreslie, to
se^k him in his kirk and hes na les expreslie forbiddin to seik him in the
desert. Thairfoir his kirk can nocht be in the desert. Bot grant and to zou
that it had been in the desert, ze should have schawin at mair lenth, quhow lang
their it hade remanit: and may cheiflie of all, ^old have declarit be quhome
as principal instrume^t^^ it had been brocht forth of the desert. For as to
ws, we have seen nane of them, quhome ze say to have been in the desert, bot
ane forloppen company of monkis and freris, nocht out of the desert, bot of
the closter to embrace the liberty of zour euangell: suay I feir grethumlee,
that in quhatsumeuer desert zour kirk was afoir zou, it do as zit their in
remane. Thus I am constranit to say, because their is na thing in the quhilk ze
vant mair, nor that Christ hes reseruet to him self money thousandis, quha hes
nocht bowit their knie to Baal: As to zou all, considdering ze have embraced
samtyme our religioun, gif it be falls, ze have all bowit zour knies to Baal:
thairfoir of necessity ze mon all pas to the desert to serce and inquyre
them, quh^me Christ hes reserved to him self, and quha hes nocht bowit as zit
their knies to Baal. Forther, gif zour kirk afoir Iohne Calvin was in the
desert, and alluterlie invisible, ze can nocht be assured in any ways, quether
gif it used sic scriptures as we use or nocht: thairfoir ze have na just title
[considering ze reject the authority of our kirk) to usurp our scripturis
in any ways: for lyk as zour kirk was in the desert, suay was zour scriptures,
and because that na man hes brocht them forth of the desert as zit, we may
instlie suspect that they be sumpart discrepant from ouris, at the leist ze can
nocht be assured in the contrar. Thairfoir of necessity ze mon prove
[considdering the scriptures can nocht be acknawlegit bot be the true kirk)
either that zour inuisibill kirk hes vsit sic scriptures as we use, or ellis ze
can have na just title, nor authority to usurp our scriptures.

As quhair ze say, that Elias be his exempill, dois confirm the kirk at sum
time to have been invisible: gif we wald grant unto zow that thing quhilk ze
may ernistfullie desire, to wit the kirk during the time of Elias to have
been inuisibill, zit ze war no nerar zour propos. First because that in the self
same time, we have for our part at the leist Elias, quhome we may produce as
witness aganis zow: zebe the contrar can nocht be able to name ane, during the
time of the inuisibilitie of zour kirk. Secu^dlie the kirk of God hes at na
time been sa obscurit nor hid, bot he of his providence hes reseruit sindrie,
as ane seminar, be quhome he hes prorogat his doctrine to the posterity.
Thairfoir gif ze wald have followit the exempill of Elias, ze should have
produced ane at the leist, indewit with the true wirschiping of God fra quhome
it had ordourlie cum unto zow, and the remanent of zour prophetis. For in this
manner we reid, that Elias did anoint, and constitute Heliseus ane propheit. And
gif ze wald considder the haill histories of the au'd testament, ze sall nocht
be abill to find, that in any time the true wirshiping of God did sa perische,
in the quhilk he hes nocht reseruet sum, as said is, as ane seminar to the
posterity. Quhilk, gif we see to have sa prec^selie obseruit in the synagoge,
quhik was bot ane schaddou, and vmbre of the true kirk, and at su^ time was to
have ane e^d: quhat tha^ should we belief of the kirk Christ, quha for
inheretance hes received the hail world. And as he testifies him self, the seid
quhilk he hes plantit, that is his word, sall grow and multiply euin to the
end of the world. For albeid that it, be pers^cutione, heresies, or other
meanis maid decay in sumpart of the world: zit vniuersalie it sall nocht decay
befoir the letter day, quhairfoir the exempill of Elias does na ways help zou.
Bot quhat gist preif euin during the time of Elias, the kirk to have been
visitill, mycht nocht the haill world be iustoccasioun call zou ane may
impudent man, and worthy of oll punitioun, quha dois abuse the simple and
ignorant people be sic forgett and falls persuasions. Thairfoir, that zour
impudency be knawin to the haill world, I ansuer resolutlie, that in the time
of Elias, and in that self same time quhilk ze allege, the kirk of God was
visible and manifest in the haill kinkdome of Judah, the sacrifice was offerit
in Jerusalem, the ceremoneis and exercise of religioun was practiced: Io
saphat quha was than king, was ane of the may Godly princes, that ever ra^g
in Iudatand to be schort, throw his haill empire, all thing was to be found
^uhilk was any way requisite to the visibili ie of the kirk as i, manifest in
the bu^kis of the kings. It is true, that in the kingdom of Israel the
persecutioun was greit, in sa far, that Elias beleuit that amang the prophetis
of God he was left his alane, bot S. Iohne knox, other be extreme ignorance, or
extreme malice wald collect uniuersallie, that the haill kirk was than
inuisibill. because Elias mening of the persecutione of Achab only, and on
naway of the kingdom of Judah did say that he was left his alane. Thairfoir to
conclude this argument quhilk ^sis to be the chief ground of the inuisibill
kirk of Iohne Calvin, and S. Iohne knox is allut^rlie aganis them: that onles
their me^strals had lang syne tint all schame, they should be eschemit of sic
vane and fantastical doctrine, ^gust. de ^nit. ecclesie ^tat. Mil. ^nt. Perm.

I have brocht aganis zou. Quhilk I say to that effect, that the reader
perceive, that ze have vsit na other argumentis, for the confirmatione of the
may chief ground and pillar of zour religioun, that is to est thelis zour
inuist ill kirk nor they quha in all agis hes been estemit as heretikis: And
thad I, be the contrar to prove the kirk to be visible in all age, and to have
continual successioun of lauchfull pastors and doctouris, do use na other
argume^tis bot thais, quhilk in all agis, they that were estemit for Christian
men, and lau bfull pastouris of the kirk does ever use.

THE LETTER.
Their is sum I know, perchance, for laick other of good discurs or wit,

the prosperous succes of zour pairt (in warldlie thingis I mean) prouis it that
ze follow to be of verity. nor zit our decay and adversity, makis our pairt

THE REST OF SCHIR IOHNE knox ansuer.
We micht have passed by this parcel without ansuer, because that nothing in it
conceived* ^^stly can be laid to our charge. For our warldly (...)
prosperity, and rest, nether is, nathir yet hes been at any time, sense we
haif embrassed the eua^gell of Jesus Christ, such as may nurishe ws in
wickedness: nether yet are the Papists able to convict ws of such impictie, as
all the world know, has roung among them of mo yearis then an hundredth thryse
told. And in the mean time, to what honor and worldly dignity they
arascendet we make theme selves judges. If they say the doctrine which we teach,
is wondroufly spread within this hundredth years: so that now, it hes all moist
red the self forth of bondage. we waild domand of the Papists, if the euangell
of Jesus Christ ceased to be the doctrine of salvation, All this is no thing to
the propois.
what time the kirkis gat rest in iwdea, and else where, in the days of the
apostles. If they ansuer, that they mean no such thing, then yet we dema^d, if
the hand of the lord be more shortened now, the^ that it was in the primitive
kirk: so that now he may not alsweill manteane his treuth, and enlarge the
kingdom of his only sone, as that he did in the days of the apostlis.
whatsoever the papists fall ansuer, we are assured that nether is his power
diminished so that he may not manteane his treuth: nether yet is his luf so
waxen cold toward his kirk, but that he will in his anger remember upon his
mercy. why do not those cruel men considder, what innocent blood has been
shed for the testimony of Christ's euangell within these three score years.
would they that god at no time should shaw piety upon the patie^t suffering of
his afflicted kirk? would they they that the suord should still deuor? would they
that the flamming fyres should never be quenchet? Gif that so they would, they
shaw them selves the sons of him quho heth been a mortherer from the
beginning, and yet contineu in the same malice. But our god bears to wards
his weak children a fatherly affection, whereby he is moved sometimes, to stay
the fury and rage of Satan for a ceason: to the end, that his chosen more
gladelie may prepair them selves to a new batall, true it is the doctrine of
saluatiun is greatly enlarged, and thairof we praise god: true it is that
Satan has not universally such power to persecute as somtymes he has had.
But will Master Tyrie thairof conclude, that in our kirk there is no
strength? But now to the scriptures which Master Tyrie coateth.

True it is that David in his. 73 psalm according to the count o^f the
hebreues affirms, that nether the word lie prosperity of the ongodlie, nor yet
the afflictioun of the godly ought to discourage such as fear god. In this
general head we aggre with Master Tyrie, and with all Papistis. But we
affirm that the notes and signs, which the holy ghost gives in that place
be the which the wicked shall be known, do noways appertene to ws: but of many
yearis most evidently have appeared, and to this hour do yet appear in the
Pape, in many of those that manteane his kingdom. For whether that the
generatiou^ of that Roman antechrist, has been exemed from the troubles of
men whether that their pride hes been as visible as ever was their garment
whether that their eyes have start out fort fatnes: and f^nally quhether that
their licencious leuinges, their opression and s^perstitiouu have not planelie
declared, that they have set their mouth against the heaven, we are content that
the world [be it never so blind] the histories of their lives [not written be
ws bot be their awin scribes] and the verray experience which all me^ now have,
and heirtofoir have had of their procedingis bear record wheter that they or
we be noted in that psalm. we gif Master Tyrie to understand that we are
better acquented with the lives and co^uersations of the Papis and Cardinales,
than they think ws to be? and that we know the streingth of their laws,
decries, statutes, and consalles better then the Jesuits knows the reule of
Jesus, albeid that persumptiouflie thai have usurped his name. And thairfoir we
will crave of. M. Tyrie and of all his factioun, that in writting ather to ws,
ze should hawe specifi^t firm thing in the quhil^ simplicit^e had not ben^ kepit.
or yet till such as they would persuade: that they wse treuth and simplicity,
and so sall they find them selves better contented in reading of our
ansueris. For this, befoir the lord Jesus we protest that it is the treuth
which we teach and whairin we delight: the lufe whereof causes ws abhor all
man's inuentioun, superstition, and Idolatry. And thus far to the ansueris of
the scriptures, which. M. Tyrie coateth.

Now to the sentence of the ancient writar, whoise name he suppresseth. we say
that his words cut the throttes of the proud Papists of that age and of all
their is to be referrit to the false preastes and hypochrites, who followers
sense thois days. For then began the taill of the dragoun, to draw the stars
from the heaven to the earth: then began the fontanis which sumtymes gave cleir
and wholesome watter to become bitter yea to be turned unto blood, and yet did
they prosper in all worldly felicity. which was the cause that many godly men
lamenting that publict corruptione, we compelled to prononce, that and like
sentences against the very kirk me^ that then lived. And least that Master
Tyrie should think that this we affirm without autorie we remitt him to the
writtingis of Hierome Augustene Ambrose Benard and vtners that were nether cum
long befoir nor ^f there the time that he notes: Extrem impudence.
whois writtinges if he sall diligently examine he fall find, what was their
judgment of the seat of Rome in their days, and what others that after
followed, addet to the former impiety of their fathers: from the day that ones
Popes were decored, ar rather deformed with a triple croune, let the writars of
all agis sense bear witness? And least that M. Tyrie shall thank that we put
him tomuche pane when that we send him tho all writars in general. we fall
releue him somquhat, and appoint him to tuo only whom justly he ca^ nocht
suspect to have been corrupted be ws. The one is ^bbas Ioachim, a man sometimes
of great authority and reputatione among the Papists The other is loa^nes
Auentinus (...) oriographour quhais wretinges was prentet be command, and with
privilege the empreour Charles the sist: let the writtingis, we say thais tuo
bear witness, what hes been the judgment of diverse men in diverse ages, of Rome,
of the pride of the prelacie, of their corruptione, in life and doctrine, and
finally of their defection from the treuth. Abbas Ioac^im writting upon the
wordis of the reuclatione of Saint Iohne, the sext angel poured forth has
phyole upon the great flood euphrates. etc. hes this sentence. Si autem aqua
huius ^uminis quod vocatur euphrates, populi sunt, and gentes, and linguae,
quae parent Romano imperio: si quidem ciuitas Romana ipsa est noua Babylon.
etc. that if [saith he] the watters of this flood that is callit uphrates be
people, nations and tounges that obey the Roman empire, for the city of Rome
it self is new Babylon: This place and that which ensew is of the drawing up of
the watters euidenthe shawes what was the judgment of the writers* in his days
of Rome. To wit, that it was becum new Babilo^. And least that any should think
that the author means of the ancient Roman Impyre, and nocht of the regiment
of the kirk that was in it, or in the dominion thereof he explanes him self
after whill that he interpretes the great hoore, and the kings of the earth,
who commit huredome with her. The great hoore he says the universal (...)
affirmed to be Rome, Not sais he as concerning the congregatio^n of the just,
which sum times was a (...) in it, bot as concerning the multitude of the
reprobat: who be their wicked works blaspheameth, and impungeth the same kirk

be seue it being invisible.
the ho^re and her multi^ude dis^ ersed in all the places of that Impyre: and
the kirk which was astranger blaspher^^d and impunged be the multitude* And yet
ester he explanes himself more planelie: sayng, Reges vero terrae dicti sunt
prae lati, quibus concessum est regime^ animatu^, Quorum nonulli fornic antur
cum Babilone. Q^^m quidem vt placea^t hominibus paruipendunt and necligu^t
mandatu^ dei. The kings of the earth (sais he) ar callen the prelates to
quhome the regiment of saules is committed, of whom nevertheless some co^mitt
fornicatioun with Babylon: because that they for the pleasure of men neglect and
despise the commandime^t of god And least that any should thinck that such a
sentence had recklefly eshaped him he doubles the same wordis our agane* Sayng,
Reges vero terrae esse pr^latos ecclesiae, qui fornicantur cum Babilone
superius dictum est, It is befoir said, [saieth he] that the kings of the
earth ar the prelatis of the kirkes, Such at I^ hue knox and done Iohne win
raip and W^tharis.
of whom sum commit hooredome with Babilone. And proceades farther saing (...)
quod sequitur in mercatores terrae de virtu^e (...) eius and diuites facti
sunt, ad falsos facet doors and (...) pocharitas, referendu^ est. qui
negociantur regnu^ Dei te^poralibus lucris. That is. And that which follows
[sayet he] and the mercha^des of the earth were maid rlche of her pleasures That
making merchandise of the kingdom of God, gapes for temporal advantage etc.
And after a litill upon thase words, and the merchandes of the earth shall
mu^ne etc. he sais. Negotiatores terrae sicut superius dictum est: ip^i sunt
sacerdotes bruti, qui nesciunt quae Dei sunt. Sacerdotes animales qui dati sunt
in atrium exterius vt manducent peccata populi: qui vendunt orationes and
Missa^ pro denariis, facientis domum orationis apothecam negociationis,
facientes inquam forum publicum and speluncam latrounum etc. As the
foir-^saidi^. (...)
That is, the merchandes of the earth (as is befoir said) they ar the brutish
preastes that know not those things that apperteane to God Sensual preastes
that are placed in the outward court that thai may eat the sins of the people,
who sell prayers and Messes for money: macking the house of payer ane chop of
merchandise: yea making it [I say] a publict and oppe^ market, and a den of
thieves etc. If Master Tyrie or any other of that sect, blame ws of raylling
[as commonly they use to do, when that we speak treuth, then let him and them
co^sidder that we learned not of Martyn Luther, quhat kind of men the papists
were bot that which we speak and affirm now we have received of the Papists
them selves. For this has been the mer^y^full providence of God, to warts his
litill flock ever from the beginning. That when ane universal corruption began
to spread the self, than were rased some as it were one or tuo among the hole
multitude till admonish the present age, and the posterities to cum, ^ow far
men had declyned from the original purity: that at least God might have sum
testimony that the verity of God, was not altogether buried in the earth. But
now let ws hear the judgment of vthers.

THE REFVTATION.
I Micht hane passit this justly onder silence, because it contenis nathing
quhilk any way is contrar to me. ^ot in respect it abundet of may impudent
lies, I culd ^ocht be satisfiet in my conscience, ^nl^s I had incide^tlie
admoneist the reader thairof, to the end he micht acknowledge the sincerity of
zour eua^gell. As quhair ze reios sa gretumlie in the succes of zour dostrine,
that it hes suay within schort space incresced, an multipliet: veralie I see na
cause quhilk may in on^ wais move zou Suay, in that part: in respect God, quha
of his infinite providence conse^ues his kirk at all time, hes in ane great part
purget it of men of zour faction: of the quhilk, sum be his just judgment ar
rutis out, as on profitable and pernicions to the hail world, ^theris
understanding them selves to have been meruelouslie dec^aued, hes reunited
them selves agane to the Catholict faith. Suay that their is few in the haill

Scotland, and in the county of ^alatine in Germainie. Thairfoir it hes nocht
sa gretum^lie incressed as ze believe. and be the providence of God the vanity
of it is daily mair and mair espied. Bot to pas fordwart, ze promeis first to
adduce certane testimoneis, be verteu of the quhilk ze may be able to preif
deprauation, nocht only of manners, bot alsuay of doctrine to have been in the
Roman kirk. Bot hauea^d adduced sum testimoneis of abbat ^oachim, and

or to quhat effect it was said, for it was nocht said aganis the Papis of Rome,
as he fal^lie allegis, bot aganis the paganis of Rome, suay I marvel of his

of it, zit he affirms that it was said aganis the Papis of Rome, I marvel
alsuay that he vsis the authority of Abb^t Ioachim, to prove corruptioun of
doctrine in the Roman kirk, considering he confessis him to have been ane
Paptist. And as is manifest of the concell of laterane, Con: later. can. 2.

quhilk he wald nocht have done, gif he had iugit it to have followit falls and

cleirlie that he hes litill regard to the verity, or ellis he should have been
eschamit to have brocht sic me^nis testimoneis in confirmatione of any thing,

that quhilk he hes brocht of Ioachim prouis only sum corruptione and
deprauatioun of manners, to have been in the kirk during his time, quhilk we

liberty of the spous of Jesus Christ. And after that they hade rehearsed the

been justly deposed thairfra. Gonterus did oppose him self in that pairt to
the bischop of Rome, affirmand allmaist all that quhilk ze have rehersie. This

ambitioun in ane iniust cause opposite him to the Pape of Rome, quhat can be
collecked of this propositione I can nocht easelie perceive. Thairfoir I leif

of that age of the ^eat of Rome, it is first n^ toriuslie knawin of the fourt

faction of the Pope, to wit Gerochus and Paulus, so co^er the shame of that
deceauer, but that they if sufficient light to men, to se wha^t mischeaf lurked
within the bosom of that pestilent seat. For writting What the said Heldebrand
did, what time that he was first deposed from that seat, which be craift and
without all ordour he did usurp [thay say] that he spared not largely to
bestow the patrimony of the kirk upon soldiers and upon capitane of war:
upon the which the pure, (...), should have been susteaned: yea, they affirm
that he show him self mair rigerus against the empreour, then it become ane
pastor to have done. If this was their judgment who took upon them to defend
his action and cause, what think we was the judgment of otheres.

That shall we better understand he his accusatione, and be the sentence
prononced agains him be all the bischoppes of france and Germany. who with one
voce concluded, that Hildebrand was ambitious peri^^ed: ane vsurpour of the
empriou^is authority, one that violated and brak the concord of the kirk: and
therefore that he was on worthy of that seat. This sentence was prononced in
his owen face, whill that he was Sitting in counsel in Rome be one Rulandus,
cheaf preast of Parma. who boldly and without any salutation offering the
decreit of the counsall* togidder with the empriouris leters, said This
Hildebrand is no bischop, no father, no pasture, he is a theaf, a wolf, a
murderer, a tyranne and thairfoir lat him be deposed etc. we are not ignorant,
that theirof ensewe great tumult, sedition, and trouble. But as that purget no
thing his former infamy, so did it not stop that mouths of many planelie to
prononce, judgment they had of him and of that seat. To wit, that he under the
title of Christ did the werray werk of the Antichrist: that he sat in the
temple of God, which then was become Babylon, that he was worschippit and
extolled above all that which was called God: that he was glorified as if he
culd not err etc. Thais and others crimes of no les w^eght war laid in that
age, to the bischoppes and seat of Rome: and this was far without the term of
three hundredth years within the which, M. Tyrie would limitat the doctrine of our
kirk. But let ws hear forther.

THE REFVTATION.
THe true narra^tioun of the history is this. Henry the 4. haueand commitet
sindrie and diue wechtie crimes, was excommunicat be Gregorius the ^ bischop of
Rome, quha of befoir was namit Heldebrand. During the quhilk time their was
certane bischopis of Germany fauorars of the empriour. ama^gis the quhilkis
villiame bischop of Mastrich as principal accused the said Greg^ir as
onlauchfullie electit, Lambertus de gestis german* in fin^ Buching^ru^ in vita
gregori 17. Cuspinianus in vita henrici imerat.
and on worthy of that seat: quha^^throw be ane comoun concell amongis th^me
they did surrogat the bis^hop of Raue^ne in his rowme. Bot considder the end of
the tragedy (as ze call it) the said Henry the fourt fenzeand emendiment of
life, being accompanit with certan bischoppis passit to Rome during the
vehemency of the winter, and greit storms, to the end he should obtene
absolution fra the said Gregorius. Bot schortlie thairefter brakand his promeis
and falland in the lyk iniquity, was within schort space throch the just
judgment of God deposed be his sone fra his empire, and thair^y dreuin in
dolor and displesour miserably endit his life. And villiame bischop of
mastrich principal and head of the said coniuratione, e^ter he had been often
accuctumet to exco^municat this Gregour bischop of Rome, at the last did
oppinlie cry out in presence of the haill co^uentioun for the time, that he was
throw the just judgment of God justly condamnit, in so far as he had nocht
deulie schawin obedience to his superiouris, and had been the author of so
greit euillis, and iniquities, end and his life miserably in the said
desperatiosu^. Quhairthrou any man may easalie perceive gif this history doith
tend to the confirmatioun of zour opinioun. in respect thais bischoppis of
Germany had nocht allegit the said gregour on worthy of that seat, gif they
had denyit the Roman authority: lyk alsuay as they wald nocht have surrogat
ane other in his place: And the punitioun of God had nocht been sa seueir
aganis the Emperor him self and his principal accomplesis, onles his cause had
been iniust.

AS the practices of the bischoppes of Rome, were moir and more espied, the
bischopes of Germany assembled them selves in counsall at Regmoburgium: where
the bischope of that same cuntrie in his most vehement orison maid against the
authoris of seditiou^, among other things pronounced this sentence against
the bischoppis and ^eat of Rome: Christ our sal^our (sais he) most dilige^tlie
foir warned ws to be war of falls Christ's and falls prophets, whom he willed
ws to discern and know be their works, whom presently on les we be moir
than blind we may se. For (says he) Romani fluminis arma in omnes habent
Christianos, audendo fallendo, ^at is Schir ^^hne with ^^e r^st of ^^s
ministe^^s.
and bella ex bellis ferendo, magni facti omnes trucida^t, occidunt pacem
concordiam terris de^ ellut. etc. That is these Roman preastes (he notes the
hole rabble) make weir against all Christianes, sum times malepartlie, some times
craftelie and be deceat thai still continue, war upon war. Tay them selves
being made great, murder, and slay the sheap. Breuelie they tak peace and
concord from the earth. ^ent: lib. 7.
And after a little in the same orison, which is to be found in the se^int book
of the history foresaid he says: Hildebrandus ante annos cen^um atque
septuaginta, primus specie relig^o^^s antihristi Imperii fundamedta iecit. Hoc
bellum nephandum primus auspicatu^est, quod per successores hucusq^e
continuatur etc. That is, Hildebrand (says he) before an hundredth, and (...)
years first under aperance of religioun laid the fundatioun of the empire of
the Antichrist, he first began this on happy war, which to this day is
continued be his successoures: he farther proc^ades and says, believe the man
that hes experience. Thays preastes of Babylon desire to regne alone: they
shall not cease unto (...) time as that they have oppressed the honor of the
Roman empire. And consequently the true pastures that would fead the flock
being oppressed, and the barking doges being removed they shall extinguis the
truth, they shall murder and trod all things under their feat: that shall
sit in the temple of God, and be extolled above all that is worcheped etc. gif
their b^^^ch^ppis w^^ re halie, Z^^ and zour^^ nisteris ar heretics


These and many other graves sentences were prononced be the said ebirhardus and
were ratified, and confirmed be the hole bischoppes and senate of Germany:
whereby it is evident what judgment that age had of the bischoppes of Rome and
their colleges. To avoid farther prolixitie, we omit the orison and judgment
of Probus the bischop of Tullose public the set forth against the pape and
against his practices in the days of lodouicus the fourt emperor, together
with the iugementis of mauy other: ze have ci^^ as zit na^cient Write.

AGainst this exhortation will we object nothing. For our ernest desire is,

we dampened, and ever has damned: but this we fear not to affirm, as befoir
we have written, that the doctrine of the Papisticall kirk, now many years by

their catholic faith, hes no sure ground within the word of god: and that the
way which they for the most pairt have followed, westhe verray way of

si^ men, as they war in deid, they wald have been destitute of all concurrence

word of God. As to begin at Simon Magus, Act. 8.
quha callit him self the very verteu of God. Aug. con. epi. Manichei.
Manicheus in lyk manner did call him self Apostle of God. Marmetus affirms
him to have received his law out of the hand of God. And laitlie luther and
Calvin, with their accomplises, dois may arrogantlie va^t them selves, that
all their doctrine proceadis from the instinctione of the halie spreit. Suay
zeschaw cleirlie, that ze do follow in this behalf the fu^stoppes of falls
prophetis that has been afoir zou, quha ever without all probation (as ze do

As quhair ze allege, the man of sin to be reuelit in the seat of Rome, it is
fa far repugnant to the verity, that it is may cleirlie, and evidently
prouen be the word of God, and continuatioun of Pastoures of all agis, the
bischop of Rome to be the successor of Petir, and pastor of the universal
