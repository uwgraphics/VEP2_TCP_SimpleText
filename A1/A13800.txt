SONGS OF 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts.

BY THOMAS TOMKINS: Organist of his Majesty's Chapel ROYAL in Ordinary.

LONDON: Printed for Matthew Lownes, John Brown, and Thomas Snodham.

Cum Priuilegio.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable William Earl of Pembroke, Lord Herbert of Cardiffe,
Lord Par and Rosse of Kendall, Lord Marmion and St. Quintin, Lord Warden of the
Stanneries in the Counties of Deuon and Cornwall, Captain of his Majesty's
Town and Castle of Portsmouth, and the Isle of Portsey, in the County of
Southampton, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of Wilts and Somerset, Chancellor
of the University of Oxford, Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's most Honorable
Household, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of his
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council.
My very good Lord;

THough it may seem a presumptuous and improper thing for me to present your
Honor with a Song, who are daily busied in the great and weighty Counsels and
affairs of the King and Kingdom: Yet have not my thoughts been wound up to
this height, without an appearing reason to my self, of excuse, and pardon at
the least, if not of fittingnesse, and hope of acceptance.

For though your Lordships employments be daily, yet has the Day many hours,
and if you should bestow all of them on sad and serious matters, you might
shorten them, and deprive us too soon of the benefit both of your Counsels and
Actions. Besides, (if I may presume to give your Lordship any account of my
poor self) I first breathed, and beheld the Sun, in that Country, to which
your Lordship gives the greatest luster, taking the Title of your Earldom
from it, and even therefore have always (I know not by what secret power of
natural affection) ever honored and wished your Lordships prosperity. To
which considerations may be added that goodness of nature, eminent in your
Lordship, which was ever a friend to Music, and the known virtues of your
mind, which seems to be best in tune, in those who love Music best, as
being least distracted with low cogitations, and your often frequenting and
favorable attention to the Music in the Chapel, which uses sometimes to
raise the soul above her Companions, Flesh, and Blood; as also the place you
hold under his Majesty, which consequently renders you, a Patron and Protector
of Music.

Concerning the Songs, if they shall be found answerable to the desire and
affection of their indulgent Parent: I beseech your Honor to consider, that as
there are few men absolutely perfect, save only in contemplation; so neither
is more clearenesse to be expected in the Rivers, then in the Spring, nor more
perfection, in imperfect men's contemplations, or works of this kind.

For the lightness of some of the words, I can only plead an old (but ill)
custom, which I wish were abrogated: Although the Songs of these Books will
be even in that point, suitable to the people of the world, wherein the rich and
poor, sound and lame, sad and fantastical, dwell together.

Lastly, I do again most humbly beseech your Lordship to pardon my
presumption, and to accept of these my imperfect offers, who will offer my
prayers to God for your Lordship, that you may enjoy a happy and blessed
Harmony in the whole course of your life, (between your self and your
friends, your body and mind) to the end that you may have content (which is
the best kind of Music) here, and the Music of Angels hereafter. This is,
and shall be, the prayer of

Your Honors most humbly devoted in all observance and duty,

THOMAS TOMKINS.

To my Brother the AVTHOR.
YEt thou were mortal: now begin to live,
And end with only Time. Thy Muses give
What Nature has denied, Eternity:
Gladly my younger Muse does honor thee,
But mine is no praise. A large increase it has
That Is multiplied through strong affections glass.
Yet is thy worth the same, and were no other
Though as a Judge I spoke, not as a Brother.
This comfort have, this Art's so great, so free,
None but the good can reach to censure thee.
JOHN TOMKINS.

CANTVS.

MVSICA SACRA: TO Six Voices.

Composed in the Italian tongue BY GIOVANNI CROCE. Newly Englished.



IN LONDON PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE, the assign of William Barley. 1608.

To the virtuous Lovers of Music.
THese Sonnets, composed first most exquisitely in Italian by Sior. Francesco
Bembo a Gentleman of Italy; were so admired of Giouan. Croce, one of the most
excellent Musicians of the world; as well for their Poesy, as Piety (the
Substance of them being drawn from those seven notable Psalms called
Penetentials; indicted by that Sweet Singer of Israel, inspired of the holy
Spirit) as that he thought it worthy of his skill in Music, to apply them to
this Harmony of Six parts; as well to honor their Author and his
Composition, as to give a profitable Delight unto the virtuous. And my self
often observing the general applause given these Songs when I have heard them
soong, (though sometimes without the words) thought it would be very grateful
to many of our English lovers of Music, if they were translated, or imitated
in our tongue: the rather, because through their want of understanding the
Italian, they are deprived of a Chief part of their delight. For albeit that
the very concent of the Note may sweetly strike the outward sense of the ear;
yet it is the Dittie, which conuayed with the Music to the intellectual
Soul, by the Organs of hearing, that does touch the heart, and stir the
affections either to Iocondnes, or Sadness, Leuitie, or Gravity, according to
the nature of the Composition: in which respect (especially) the articulate
voice of man excels all other voices, and Instruments in the world. Besides
I supposed, that the Scarcetie (not only in our tongue, but in all other
vulgars) of Music in this kind, whereby men may be edified and God
glorified, would make these the more acceptable; and peradventure be a motive
to some of our excellent Musicians to dedicate their divine skill to the
Service of God, in Songs of this more Sanctified kind In which respects; and
for that I was encouraged thereto by some, Skillful in this Art: I have
adventured to publish these (otherwise destinate to priuacie) unto the view of
the world: Although I am not Ignorant that in this curious age, it is likely to
run the ordinary fortune (even of more exact labors) upon the Shelues of
ridged censure: But the Gentle, will winck at small faults where they spy
them: As for the Supercilious Critic if (after he have compared them with the
Original) he dislike them: he may please him self, and do them all better:
But do Ye accept them with a Serene browe, and use them to the glory of God,
and your Laudable and Christian delight. Fare ye well.

Your well-willer

R. H.

FIRST SONNET Ex Psalm. 6.
LOrd, in thy wrath reprove me not seuearly,
Nor punish me in thy deserved displeasure:
Have mercy on my Sins exceeding measure,
For full of fears, my Soul is vexed drearly.
Save it (O Lord) Almightie-most Supernall,
Save it (alas) from the'uer-neuer Dying:
For who in deep Hell (and fierce Torments frying)
Shall sing thy praise, or can extol The Eternal?
Long have I Languisht in my grievous Sorrow's,

Have free forgiveness, and a full remission:

Are not Imputed, but in mercy hidden.
Therefore my Crime I have confessed before thee;
Which graciously (my God) thou have forgiven:

And all thy Saints shall in due time adore thee.

SONGS OF 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts.

BY THOMAS TOMKINS: Organist of his Majesty's Chapel ROYAL in Ordinary.

LONDON: Printed for Matthew Lownes, John Brown, and Thomas Snodham.

Cum Priuilegio.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable William Earl of Pembroke, Lord Herbert of Cardiffe,
Lord Par and Rosse of Kendall, Lord Marmion and St Quintin, Lord Warden of the
Stanneries in the Counties of Deuon and Cornwall, Captain of his Majesty's
Town and Castle of Portsmouth, and the Isle of Portsey, in the County of
Southampton, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of Wilts and Somerset, Chancellor
of the University of Oxford, Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's most Honorable
Household, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of his
Majesty's most Honorable Priuic Council.
My very good Lord;

THough it may seem a presumptuous and improper thing for me to present your
Honor with a Song, who are daily busied in the great and weighty Counsels and
affairs of the King and Kingdom: Yet have not my thoughts been wound up to
this height, without an appearing reason to my self, of excuse, and pardon at
the least, if not of fittingnesse, and hope of acceptance.

For though your Lordships employments be daily, yet has the Day many hours,
and if you should bestow all of them on sad and serious matters, you might
shorten them, and deprive us too soon of the benefit both of your Counsels and
Actions. Besides, (if I may presume to give your Lordship any account of my
poor self) I first breathed, and beheld the Sun, in that Country, to which
your Lordship gives the greatest luster, taking the Title of your Earldom
from it, and even therefore have always (I know not by what secret power of
natural affection) ever honored and wished your Lordships prosperity. To
which considerations may be added that goodness of nature, eminent in your
Lordship, which was ever a friend to Music, and the known virtues of your
mind, which seems to be best in tune, in those who love Music best, as
being least distracted with low cogitations, and your often frequenting and
favorable attention to the Music in the Chapel, which uses sometimes to
raise the soul above her Companions, Flesh, and Blood; as also the place you
hold under his Majesty, which consequently renders you, a Patron and Protector
of Music.

Concerning the Songs, if they shall be found answerable to the desire and
affection of their indulgent Parent: I beseech your Honor to consider, that as
there are few men absolutely perfect, save only in contemplation; so neither
is more clearenesse to be expected in the Rivers, then in the Spring, nor more
perfection, in imperfect men's contemplations, or works of this kind.

For the lightness of some of the words, I can only plead an old (but ill)
custom, which I wish were abrogated: Although the Songs of these Books will
be even in that point, suitable to the people of the world, wherein the rich and
poor, sound and lame, sad and fantastical, dwell together.

Lastly, I do again most humbly beseech your Lordship to pardon my
presumption, and to accept of these my imperfect offers, who will offer my
prayers to God for your Lordship, that you may enjoy a happy and blessed
Harmony in the whole course of your life, (between your self and your
friends, your body and mind) to the end that you may have content (which is
the best kind of Music) here, and the Music of Angels hereafter. This is,
and shall be, the prayer of

Your Honors most humbly devoted in all observance and duty,

THOMAS TOMKINS.

To my Brother the AVTHOR.
YEt thou were mortal: now begin to live,
And end with only Time. Thy Muses give
What Nature has denied, Eternity:
Gladly my younger Muse does honor thee,
But mine is no praise. A large increase it has
That Is multiplied through strong affections glass.
Yet is thy worth the same, and were no other
Though as a Judge I spoke, not as a Brother.
This comfort have, this Art's so great, so free,
None but the good can reach to censure thee.
JOHN TOMKINS.

MVSICA SACRA: TO Six Voices.

Composed in the Italian tongue BY GIOVANNI CROCE.

Newly Englished.



IN LONDON PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE, the assign of William Barley. 1608.

To the virtuous Lovers of Music.
THese Sonnets, composed first most exquisitely in Italian by Sior. Francesco
Bembo a Gentleman of Italy; were so admired of Giouan. Croce, one of the most
excellent Musicians of the world; as well for their Poesy, as Piety (the
Substance of them being drawn from those seven notable* Psalms called
Penetentials; indicted by that Sweet Singer of Israel, inspired of the holy
Spirit) as that he thought it worthy of his skill in Music, to apply them to
this Harmony of Six parts; as well to honor their Author and his
Composition, as to give a profitable Delight unto the virtuous. And my self
often observing the general applause given these Songs when I have heard them
soong, (though sometimes without the words) thought it would be very grateful
to many of our English lovers of Music, if they were translated, or imitated
in our tongue: the rather, because through their want of understanding the
Italian, they are deprived of a Chief part of their delight. For albeit that
the very concent of the Note may sweetly strike the outward sense of the ear;
yet it is the Dittie, which conuayed with the Music to the intellectual
Soul, by the Organs of hearing, that does touch the heart, and stir the
affections either to Iocondnes, or Sadness, Leuitie, or Gravity, according to
the nature of the Composition: in which respect (especially) the articulate
voice of man excels all other voices, and Instruments in the world. Besides
I supposed, that the Scarcetie (not only in our tongue, but in all other
vulgars) of Music in this kind, whereby men may be edified and God
glorified, would make these the more acceptable; and peradventure be a motive
to some of our excellent Musicians to dedicate their divine skill to the
Service of God, in Songs of this more Sanctified kind In which respects; and
for that I was encouraged thereto by some, Skillful in this Art: I have
adventured to publish these (otherwise destinate to priuacie) unto the view of
the world: Although I am not Ignorant that in this curious age, it is likely to
run the ordinary fortune (even of more exact labors) upon the Shelues of
ridged censure: But the Gentle, will winck at small faults where they spy
them: As for the Supercilious Critic if (after he have compared them with the
Original) he dislike them: he may please him self, and do them all better:
But do Ye accept them with a Serene browe, and use them to the glory of God,
and your Laudable and Christian delight.

Fare ye well.

Your well-willer

FIRST SONNET Ex Psalm. 6.
LOrd, in thy wrath reprove me not seuearly,
Nor punish me in thy deserved displeasure:
Have mercy on my Sins exceeding measure,
For full of fears, my Soul is vexed drearly.
Save it (O Lord) Almighty most Supernall,
Save it (alas) from the'uer-neuer Dying:
For who in deep Hell (and fierce torments frying)
Shall sing thy praise, or can extol The Eternal?

My bed and bosom, with my tears I water:

Has heard my moan, and does regard my matter.

SONGS OF 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts.

BY THOMAS TOMKINS: Organist of his Majesty's Chapel ROYAL in Ordinary.

LONDON: Printed for Matthew Lownes, John Brown, and Thomas Snodham.

Cum Priuilegio.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable William Earl of Pembroke, Lord Herbert of Cardiffe,
Lord Par and Rosse of Kendall, Lord Marmion and St. Quintin, Lord Warden of the
Stanneries in the Counties of Deuon and Cornwall, Captain of his Majesty's
Town and Castle of Portsmouth, and the Isle of Portsey, in the County of
Southampton, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of Wilts and Somerset, Chancellor
of the University of Oxford, Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's most Honorable
Household, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of his
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council.
My very good Lord;

THough it may seem a presumptuous and improper thing for me to present your
Honor with a Song, who are daily busied in the great and weighty Counsels and
affairs of the King and Kingdom: Yet have not my thoughts been wound up to
this height, without an appearing reason to my self, of excuse, and pardon at
the least, if not of fittingnesse, and hope of acceptance.

For though your Lordships employments be daily, yet has the Day many hours,
and if you should bestow all of them on sad and serious matters, you might
shorten them, and deprive us too soon of the benefit both of your Counsels and
Actions. Besides, (if I may presume to give your Lordship any account of my
poor self) I first breathed, and beheld the Sun, in that Country, to which
your Lordship gives the greatest luster, taking the Title of your Earldom
from it, and even therefore have always (I know not by what secret power of
natural affection) ever honored and wished your Lordships prosperity. To
which considerations may be added that goodness of nature, eminent in your
Lordship, which was ever a friend to Music, and the known virtues of your
mind, which seems to be best in tune, in those who love Music best, as
being least distracted with low cogitations, and your often frequenting and
favorable attention to the Music in the Chapel, which uses sometimes to
raise the soul above her Companions, Flesh, and Blood; as also the place you
hold under his Majesty, which consequently renders you, a Patron and Protector
of Music.

Concerning the Songs, if they shall be found answerable to the desire and
affection of their indulgent Parent: I beseech your Honor to consider, that as
there are few men absolutely perfect, save only in contemplation; so neither
is more clearenesse to be expected in the Rivers, then in the Spring, nor more
perfection, in imperfect men's contemplations, or works of this kind.

For the lightness of some of the words, I can only plead an old (but ill)
custom, which I wish were abrogated: Although the Songs of these Books will
be even in that point, suitable to the people of the world, wherein the rich and
poor, sound and lame, sad and fantastical, dwell together.

Lastly, I do again most humbly beseech your Lordship to pardon my
presumption, and to accept of these my imperfect offers, who will offer my
prayers to God for your Lordship, that you may enjoy a happy and blessed
Harmony in the whole course of your life, (between your self and your
friends, your body and mind) to the end that you may have content (which is
the best kind of Music) here, and the Music of Angels hereafter. This is,
and shall be, the prayer of

Your Honors most humbly devoted in all observance and duty,

THOMAS TOMKINS.

To my Brother the AVTHOR.
YEt thou were mortal: now begin to live,
And end with only Time. Thy Muses give
What Nature has denied, Eternity:
Gladly my younger Muse does honor thee,
But mine is no praise. A large increase it has
That Is multiplied through strong affections glass.
Yet is thy worth the same, and were no other
Though as a Judge I spoke, not as a Brother.
This comfort have, this Art's so great, so free,
None but the good can reach to censure thee.

MVSICA SACRA: TO Six Voices.

Composed in the Italian tongue BY GIOVANNI CROCE.

Newly Englished.



IN LONDON PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE, the assign of William Barley. 1608.

To the virtuous Lovers of Music.
THese Sonnets, composed first most exquisitely in Italian by Sior. Francesco
Bembo a Gentleman of Italy; were so admired of Giouan. Croce, one of the most
excellent Musicians of the world; as well for their Poesy, as Piety (the
Substance of them being drawn from those seven notable Psalms called
Penetentials; indicted by that Sweet Singer of Israel, inspired of the holy
Spirit) as that he thought it worthy of his skill in Music, to apply them to
this Harmony of Six parts; as well to honor their Author and his
Composition, as to give a profitable Delight unto the virtuous. And my self
often observing the general applause given these Songs when I have heard them
soong, (though sometimes without the words) thought it would be very grateful
to many of our English lovers of Music, if they were translated, or imitated
in our tongue: the rather, because through their want of understanding the
Italian, they are deprived of a Chief part of their delight. For albeit that
the very concent of the Note may sweetly strike the outward sense of the ear;
yet it is the Dittie, which conuayed with the Music to the intellectual
Soul, by the Organs of hearing, that does touch the heart, and stir the
affections either to Iocondnes, or Sadness, Leuitie, or Gravity, according to
the nature of the Composition: in which respect (especially) the articulate
voice of man excels all other voices, and Instruments in the world. Besides
I supposed, that the Scarcetie (not only in our tongue, but in all other
vulgars) of Music in this kind, whereby men may be edified and God
glorified, would make these the more acceptable; and peradventure be a motive
to some of our excellent Musicians to dedicate their divine skill to the
Service of God, in Songs of this more Sanctified kind In which respects; and
for that I was encouraged thereto by some, Skillful in this Art: I have
adventured to publish these (otherwise destinate to priuacie) unto the view of
the world: Although I am not Ignorant that in this curious age, it is likely to
run the ordinary fortune (even of more exact labors) upon the Shelues of
ridged censure: But the Gentle, will winck at small faults where they spy
them: As for the Supercilious Critic if (after he have compared them with the
Original) he dislike them: he may please himself, and do them all better:
But do Ye accept them with a Serene browe, and use them to the glory of God,
and your Laudable and Christian delight. Fare ye well.

Your well-willer

LOrd, in thy wrath reprove me not seuearly,

Hyes (Flies) to thee: why Shu'nst thou my Complaynings?
Friends have I none; now from me All are flying:
In sted of Bread I have been fed with Ashes,

Of thy fierce Wrath, for all mine often Crying.

SONGS OF 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts.

BY THOMAS TOMKINS: Organist of his Majesty's Chapel ROYAL in Ordinary.

LONDON: Printed for Matthew Lownes, John Brown, and Thomas Snodham.

Cum Priuilegio.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable William Earl of Pembroke, Lord Herbert of Cardiffe,
Lord Par and Rosse of Kendall, Lord Marmion and St. Quintin, Lord Warden of the
Stanneries in the Counties of Deuon and Cornwall, Captain of his Majesty's
Town and Castle of Portsmouth, and the Isle of Portsey, in the County of
Southampton, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of Wilts and Somerset, Chancellor
of the University of Oxford, Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's most Honorable
Household, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of his
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council.
My very good Lord;

THough it may seem a presumptuous and improper thing for me to present your
Honor with a Song, who are daily busied in the great and weighty Counsels and
affairs of the King and Kingdom: Yet have not my thoughts been wound up to
this height, without an appearing reason to my self, of excuse, and pardon at
the least, if not of fittingnesse, and hope of acceptance.

For though your Lordships employments be daily, yet has the Day many hours,
and if you should bestow all of them on sad and serious matters, you might
shorten them, and deprive us too soon of the benefit both of your Counsels and
Actions. Besides, (if I may presume to give your Lordship any account of my
poor self) I first breathed, and beheld the Sun, in that Country, to which
your Lordship gives the greatest luster, taking the Title of your Earldom
from it, and even therefore have always (I know not by what secret power of
natural affection) ever honored and wished your Lordships prosperity. To
which considerations may be added that goodness of nature, eminent in your
Lordship, which was ever a friend to Music, and the known virtues of your
mind, which seems to be best in tune, in those who love Music best, as
being least distra^^d with low cogitations, and your often frequenting and
favorable atten^^ to the Music in the Chapel, which uses sometimes to
raise the soul above her Companions, Flesh, and Blood; as also the place you
hold under his Majesty, which consequently renders you, a Patron and Protector
of Music.

Concerning the Songs, if they shall be found answerable to the desire and
affection of their indulgent Parent: I beseech your Honor to consider, that as
there are few men absolutely perfect, save only in contemplation; so neither
is more clearenesse to be expected in the Rivers, then in the Spring, nor more
perfection, in imperfect men's contemplations, or works of this kind.

For the lightness of some of the words, I can only plead an old (but ill)
custom, which I wish were abrogated: Although the Songs of these Books will
be even in that point, suitable to the people of the world, wherein the rich and
poor, sound and lame, sad and fantastical, dwell together.

Lastly, I do again most humbly beseech your Lordship to pardon my
presumption, and to accept of these my imperfect offers, who will offer my
prayers to God for your Lordship, that you may enjoy a happy and blessed
Harmony in the whole course of your life, (between your self and your
friends, your body and mind) to the end that you may have content (which is
the best kind of Music) here, and the Music of Angels hereafter. This is,
and shall be, the prayer of

Your Honors most humbly devoted in all observance and duty,

THOMAS TOMKINS.

To my Brother the AVTHOR.
YEt thou were mortal: now begin to live,
And end with only Time. Thy Muses give
What Nature has denied, Eternity:
Gladly my younger Muse does honor thee,
But mine is no praise. A large increase it has
That Is multiplied through strong affections glass.
Yet is thy worth the same, and were no other
Though as a Judge I spoke, not as a Brother.
This comfort have, this Art's so great, so free,
None but the good can reach to censure thee.
JOHN TOMKINS.

My very good Lord;

THough it may seem a presumptuous and improper thing for me to present your

SONGS OF 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts.

BY THOMAS TOMKINS: Organist of his Majesty's Chapel ROYAL in Ordinary.

LONDON: Printed for Matthew Lownes, John Brown, and Thomas Snodham. 1622.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable William Earl of Pembroke, Lord Herbert of Cardiffe,
Lord Par and Rosse of Kendall, Lord Marmion and St. Quintin, Lord Warden of the
Stanneries in the Counties of Deuon and Cornwall, Captain of his Majesty's
Town and Castle of Portsmouth, and the Isle of Portsey, in the County of
Southampton, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of Wilts and Somerset, Chancellor
of the University of Oxford, Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's most Honorable
Household, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of his
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council.
My very good Lord;

THough it may seem a presumptuous and improper thing for me to present your
Honor with a Song, who are daily busied in the great and weighty Counsels and
affairs of the King and Kingdom: Yet have not my thoughts been wound up to
this height, without an appearing reason to my self, of excuse, and pardon at
the least, if not of fittingnesse, and hope of acceptance.

For though your Lordships employments be daily, yet has the Day many hours,
and if you should bestow all of them on sad and serious matters, you might
shorten them, and deprive us too soon of the benefit both of your Counsels and
Actions. Besides, (if I may presume to give your Lordship any account of my
pooreselfe) I first breathed, and beheld the Sun, in that Country, to which
your Lordship gives the greatest luster, taking the Title of your Earldom
from it, and even therefore have always (I know not by what secret power of
natural affection) ever honored and wished your Lordships prosperity. To
which considerations may be added that goodness of nature, eminent in your
Lordship, which was ever a friend to Music, and the known virtues of your
mind, which seems to be best in tune, in those who love Music best, as
being least distracted with low cogitations, and your often frequenting and
favorable attention to the Music in the Chapel, which uses sometimes to
raise the soul above her Companions, Flesh, and Blood; as also the place you
hold under his Majesty, which consequently renders you, a Patron and Protector
of Music.

Concerning the Songs, if they shall be found answerable to the desire and
affection of their indulgent Parent: I beseech your Honor to consider, that as
there are few men absolutely perfect, save only in contemplation; so neither
is more clearenesse to be expected in the Rivers, then in the Spring, nor more
perfection, in imperfect men's contemplations, or works of this kind.

For the lightness of some of the words, I can only plead an old (but ill)
custom, which I wish were abrogated: Although the Songs of these Books will
be even in that point, suitable to the people of the world, wherein the rich and
poor, sound and lame, sad and fantastical, dwell together.

Lastly, I do again most humbly beseech your Lordship to pardon my
presumption, and to accept of these my imperfect offers, who will offer my
prayers to God for your Lordship, that you may enjoy a happy and blessed
Harmony in the whole course of your life, (between your self and your
friends, your body and mind) to the end that you may have content (which is
the best kind of Music) here, and the Music of Angels hereafter. This is,
and shall be, the prayer of

Your Honors most humbly devoted in all observance and duty,

THOMAS TOMKINS.

To my Brother the AVTHOR.
YEt thou were mortal: now begin to live,
And end with only Time. Thy Muses give
What Nature has denied, Eternity:
Gladly my younger Muse does honor thee,
But mine is no praise. A large increase it has
That Is multiplied through strong affections glass.
Yet is thy worth the same, and were no other
Though as a Judge I spoke, not as a Brother.
This comfort have, this Art's so great, so free,
None but the good can reach to censure thee.
JOHN TOMKINS.
