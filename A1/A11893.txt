The Kingis Complaint
WIth hauie heart on Snadoun hill,

And quha his deith dois sair regaird,
And it to puneis will not spaird

Now sall appeir in wark and nature,
Quha is the true man, quha is the trature
Quha fittis the field, quha (...)is not forde,
The true liege be the Rub^^ture
In this cause salbe kend O Lord.
And think that they that did this deid,
With like effect dois seik my heid,
For to be beatin down and smorde
All Faithful hartis quyte their meid,
And thou Revenge my cause O Lord.
For surely their will and Intent,
That seikis of me the Government,
Be fraudfull factiounis, I stand forde,
Wald me forfault in Parliament,
Gif thou withstude them not O Lord.
My Coronatioun they deny,
And dois may spytefully defy
All them that faithfully restorde,
Me to my Crown and Seignorie

Last Lord now him of me hes cure,
And in quhais handis I think me sure,
Thy puissant power I Implorde,

For to Revenge his cause O Lord.
With this the Babe he gifis ane rair,
Quhilk maid my heart to sich sa sair,
That farther I culd not record,
Bot with him sall cry ever mair,
Judge and Revenge his cause O Lord.
