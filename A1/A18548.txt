When that Apprill with his shouris sote
And the droughte of march has percid the rote
A^^ badid every vein in such licour
Of which virtue engendrid is the flour
When zepherus eke with his sote breath
Enspirid has in every holte and heth
The tendir croppis^ and the young son
Has in the ram half his course y run
And small foulis mak^ melody
That slepyn al night with opyn ye
So prikith hem nature in her courage
Than longyng folk to gone on pilgremage
And palmers to seche strange londis
To serve halowis couthe in sundry londis
And specially fro every shiris end
Of yngelond to Cauntirbury thy wend
The holy blisful martyr forto seek
That them has holpyn when they were seek
ANd fill in that seson on a day
In Suthwerk at tabard as I lay
Ready to wend on my pilgremage
To Cauntirbury with devout courage
That night was come in to that hosterye
Well nine and twenty in a company
Of sundry folk be adventure y fall
In feleship as pilgrymys were they all
That toward Cauntirbury wolden ride
The chambris and the stablis were wide
And well were they esid at best
And shortly when the son was at rest
So had I spokyn with hem euerichon^
That I was of her feleship anon^
And made forward erly fo^to rise
To take our wey there as I you deuyse
But natheles whiles that y have time and space
Or that y ferth^r in this tale pace
Me thinks that it were accordaunt to reason
To tell you all the condition
Of each of hem so as it seemed me
And which they were and of what degree
And in what ^ray eke they w^ren ynne
AN^ at a knight I will begin
A kn^ght there was a worthy man
That fro the time he first began
To riden out he loved chyualrye
Truth and honor fredom and ^urtesye
Full worthy he was in his l^rdis werre
And thereto had he riden noman far
And as well in cr^stendom as in hethenesse
And ever had^e honor for his worthynesse
At al^saundre he was when it was won
Full often time he had the board begone
A houen all nations in pruce
In lettowe had he raised and in ruse
No christian man so eften times as he
In granade at the sege eke had he be
In algrith had he riden and in belmarie
At ^artage was he and eke at satalye
When they were won and in the great see
At many at nobil aryue had be he
At mortal bataillis had he be fiften^
And fought for our feith at Tramyss^ne
In l^stis thries and has sleyn his foo
This ilke worthy knight had be also
Some time with the lord of Palathie
Again another he then man in Turkye
And evermore he had a souerayn price
And though he was worthy he was wise
And of his port as meke as a ma^de
He never yet vilayns word said
In all his lif to nomaner wight
He was a gentil parfight knight
Forto tell you of his array
His bois were good but he was not gay
Of ^us^ian he wered a gippioun
Al be smered with his habergeon^
For he was late come ^ro his viage
And sent forto do his pilgremage
WIth him there was a semely young squy^r
A lover and a lusti bacheler
With lockis (...) as they were leyd in press
Of twenty yer of age he was I guess
Of his stature he was of euene lenghte
And wonderly deliver and greet of strenghte
And he had be some time in ch^ualrye
In Flaundris in Artoise and in Picardye
And born him well as of a litil space
In hope to stonden in his ladies grace
Enbrowded was he as it were a mede
Al full of fressh flouris white and read
Singing he was or floytynge al day
He was as fressh as is the month of may
Short was his gown with sleuys long and wide
Well couthe he sicte on horse and thereto fair ride
He couthe song make and well endyte
Just and dance portreye and eke write
So hot he loved that be nyghter tale
He slepte no more than a nyghtyngale
Curteys he was lowly and seruisabyl
He carf beforn^ his fader at the tabyl
A Yeman had he and seruauntis nomo
At that time for he list to ride so
And he was cled in cote and hood of grene
A sheef of arowes bright and shene
Under his ^elt he baar full thriftely
Well could he dress his takyl yomanly
His arowis droup^d not with fetheris low
And in his hond he baar a mighty bow
A not h^d he had^^ with a broun visage
Of wodemannes craft could he all the usage
Op on his arm he bare agay bracer
And by his side a swerd and a bokeler
And on that other side a gay daggare
Harneysed well and sharp as point of spear
A Cristofir on his breast full shene
An horn he baar a bawdryk grene
A forster was he sothly as I guess
THere was also a nonne a prioresse
That of her smiling was simpil and koy
Here grettest oath was be saint loy
And she was clepid dame Eglentyn^
Full well she song seruise divine
Entoyned in her boys full semely
And frensh she spak full fetously
Aftir the scole of stratforde at the bow
For frensh of Paris was to her unknow
At mete well taught was she with all
She let no morsel fro her lippis fall
Ne wete hire fingres in her sauce deep
Well could she carry a morsel of mete
That no drope fill on her breast
In courtesy was set full mykil her lest
Her ouerlippe wiped she so clean
That in her cup there was no ferthyng seen
Of greece when she had drunk her draught
Full semely aftir her mete she raught
And sikirly she was of greet disport
Of plesaunce and amyable of port
And peyned here to countrefete chiere
Of court to be statly of manner
And to be hold digne of reverence
But forto speak of her conscience
She was so charitable and so pietous
She would weep and she saw a mous
Kawght in a trappe if it were deed or bledde
Of small houndis had she that she fed
With cost flesh milk and wastel beed
But sore wept she if any of hem were ded
Or if men smoot hem with yerd smert
And al was conscience and tendir heart
Full semely her wympil pynched was
Her nose tretise here yen gray as glass
Her mouth small and thereto soft and reed
But sikirly she had a fair forheed
It was almost a span broad I trow
For hardly she was not under grow
Full setice was her cloak as I was waar
Of small coral about her harm she baar
A peyre of bedis gauded al with grene
And there on houg a brothe full shene
O^ which that first was write a cronn^d A
And aftir that amor vincit omnia
ANother Nonne with her there was
F^^^ fair of hew and bright of faas
That was her chapeleyn and prestis three
A monk there was fair for the maistre
Which before that time had be
An out ryder he loved venore
A manly man to be an abbot able
Full many a deynte horse had he in stabil
And when he wod men might his bridil here
Gyngelynge and whistelinge in the wynd clear
And eke as loud as does the chapel belle
There as the lord was keeper of the sell^
The rewle of saint Maure and of saint Benet
Be cause he held it somewhat streyt
This ilke monk let old things pass
And held aftir the new world the space
He yaf not of the text a pullet h^nne
That seith that hunters be not holy men
Ne that a monk whenne that he is rechelees
Is lik to a fish when it is waterlees
This is to say a monk out of a cloistre
But that text hold I not worth an oistre
And I say that his opinion^ was good
What should he stodye and make him wood
Up on a book alwey in cloistir to power
Or swynke with hondis and labor
As austyn did. but hou shall the world be served
Let austyn have his swynk to him reserved
Therefore he was a pricasour a right
Grehoundis he had as mylk whit
Of prykynge and of hunting for the hare
Was al his lust for no thing would he spare
I saw his sleuys purfiled at the hond
With grice and that the fynest of a land
And forto fastyn his hood under the chynne
He h^dde of gold wrought a corious pynne
And eke his face as he had be anoint
He was a lord fat and in good point
His yen steep and rollynge in his heed
That ste^yd as a furneys of leed
His bootis sowpil his horse in great astate
Now certainly he was a feir prelate
He was not pale as a forpyned ghost
A fat swan loved he lest of any roast
His palfrey was as broun as a bery
A Friar t^^r was awanton^ and a merry
A lymytour and a full solemn man
In all the ordris four is non that so well can
So much of daliaunce and fair langage
He had made meny a fair marriage
Of ^onge wommen at his owen cost
Until his order he was an nobil post
Full ^elbel^ued and full famulier was he
W^^h frankeleyns over al in his contre
And with worthy yemen of the town
For he had power of confession
And plesaunt was his absolucion
^o them that had great contricion
And sa^de him self more than a curat
And of his order he was licenciat
And an esi man to give penance
Th^re he wiste to have good pitaunce
Unto a pour order forto give
When that a man is well I shryue
If he yaf he durst make a vaunt
If that a man was repentaunt
Many a man so hard is of heart
He may not weep though he sore smerte
Therefore instead of weeping and prayers
Men most give silver to the pour freris
His tipet was I fossid full of knyuys
And with pynnys to give fair wyuys
And certain he had amery note
Merrily could he sing and pleye at the rote
Of tidyngis he baar utterly the price
Milk whit he was as the flour delyce
Thereto strong he was as a champioun
And knew the tauernys well in every town
And every osteler and tapstere
Better than^ a lazer or a beggestere
Forto unto such a man as he
Accordith not as by his faculte
To have of such sike lazers acquaintance
It is not honest it may not a vaunce
Forto dele with such poraille
But with rich and sellers of vitaille
And over al there as richesse should arise
Curteis he was and lowly of seruise
There was no man nowhere so virtuous
He was the best beggere in his ^ous
For though a wydowe had not a shoo
So plesaunt was his in prin^ipio
Yet would he have a ferthing or ^e went
His purchase was bettir than^ his rent
And bark he couthe as it were a whelpe
In louedayes there could he mykyl help
For there he nas lik a cloisterer
With a threedbare cope as a pour friar
But he was like a master or a pope
Of dub^yl worstede was his semy cope
That round was as a belle out of press
Somewhat he lispyd for his wantownesse
To make his english sweet up on his tunge
And in his harpynge when he had I ^unge
His yen^ twyn^lyd in his head a right
As done the sterris in the frosty night
This worthy friar was called hubberd
A Merchant there was with a forkid berd
In motley on high on his horse he sat
Up on his head a flaundres beuer hat
His ^eet^^ claspid fe^re and fetously
His resons he spak full solempnely
S^^wynge alwey the encrece of his w^nnynge
He wo^de the sea were kept for any thing
B^twixt Middelburgh and Orew^lle
^ell could he in his eschaunges selle
This worthy man his wit full well besette
Th^r wi^^e no wight that he was in debt
So esta^ly was he of governance
With his bargayns and with his cheuesaunce
For sothe he was a worthy man with all
A But soth to say I not how men him call
Cl^rk there was of Oxenforde also
That unto logik had long I go
As lene was his horse as a rake
And he was not right fat I undertake
But lokyd holow and thereto sobirly
Full threedbare was his ouerest courtby
For he had got him yet no benefice
Ne was not wordly to have an office
For him was leuyr to have at his beddis head
Twenty bokys I clad in whit and reed
Of Aristotle and of philosophy
Thanne robis rich or fidil or sawtrie
But al be that he was a philosophre
Yet had he but litil gold in cofre
But all that he might of his frendis have help
On bokis and on learning he it spent
And besely began for the soulis pray
Of hem that yaf him wherewith to scolaye
Of study took he most cure and head
Not o word spak he more than need
Short and quyk and high of sentence
Sownyng moral virtue was his prudence
And gladly would he learn and gladly teache
And there with full soft was his speech
A Sergeante of law waar and wis^
was there that often had be at the peruyse
That was also rich of excellence
Discrete he was and of great reverence
He semyd such his wordis were so wise
Justice he was full often in assise
Be patent and be plain commission
For his science and his high renoun
Of fees and robis had he many on
So great a purchasour was there nowher non
Al was fee simple to him in effect
His purchase might not be to him suspect
No where so besy a man as ^e there was
And yet he semyd besier than he was
In teermes had he was and domes all
That fro the time of king william were fall
Thereto he coud^ endite and make a thing
There could no wight pynche at his writing
And every statut could he pleyn be rote
He rood but homely in a meddle cote
I gr^t with a s^ynt of silk with barris small
Of his ara^ tell I no longer tale
A Frankeleyn was in his company
White was his berd as the deysie
And of his complexion was sanguyn
Well loved he be the morrow a cup wyn
To live in delight was ever his wone
For he was Epicurices owen sone
That ^^ld oppinion that pleyn delight
Was verray felicite parfite
An householder and that a great was he
Saint Julian ^e was in his contre
Hi^ breed his a^^ was alwey aftir one
A bett^r vyned man was nowher none
Without bake mete was he never in his house
His fissh his flessh and that so plentuous
It shewde in his house of mete and drink
Of all deyntees that men couthe think
Aftir the sundry seson of the year
So changed he his mete and his soper
Full many a fat partrich had ^e in mewe
And meny a brem and luce in ste^^e
Woe was his cook but his sauce were
Poynant and sharp and ready al his geer
His tabil dormaunt in his halle always
Was ready covered all the long day
At sessions there was he lord and sire
Full often time he was knight of the shire
A lace and a gipser of silk
Hyng at his girdil as white as morrow mylk
A shereue had he be and a coronour
Was nowhere such a worthy vauesour
AN habirdassher there was and a carpenter
A web a dyer and a tapiser
And they where clothed all in olyuere
Of a solemn and a greet fraternite
Full fressh and new her geer piked was
Here knyuys chapid were not with bras
But al with silver wrought full clene^ well
Here girdelis and her powchis eueridel
Well seemed each of hem a fair burgeis
To sitten in the yield halle at the deys
Enerich for the wisdom that he can
Was happily forto he an aldirman
For cateill had they ynow and rent
And here wyuys would it well assent
And ellis certain they were to blame
Hit is full fair to be called madame
And go to vigillis al before
And have a mantel rially I bore
A Cook they had with hem for the nonys
To boylle the chekens and the mary bonys
And powder merchant tart and galingale
Well knew he a draughte of london ale
He could roste sethe boil and frye
Make mortrewys and well bake a pie
But great harm was it as it thought me
For on his chynne a Marmoyl had he
And blank Manger made he with the best
A Shipman was there that woned fer bewest
For ought I woot he was of dertemouth
He r^od up a rowney as he cowth
In a gown foldynge to the kne
A daggar and a lace hanging had he
A ^^^te his neck under his arm adoun
The hot somer had made his hew al broun
And certainly he was a good felawe
Full many a draughte wyn he had draw
Fro burdeu^ ward while the chapman sleep
Of conscience took he no keep
At full many abataylle in that land
He faught and had the higher hond
But of his craft to reken well his tide
His stremys and his dangers him beside
There was non such from hul in to Cartage
For wise he was though he were full of courage
Hardy he was and wa^r to undertake
With many a tempest his berd has quake
He knew all the hauenes that there were
Fro yngelond in to the Capfenester
And every cryke in brytayne and in spain
His barge was called the Maudeleyne
WIth us there was a doctor of phisik
In the world was there non^ him lik
To speak of phisik and furgerye
For he was groundid in Astronomye
He kept his paciente a greet deel
In hour be magik natureel
Well couthe he of fortune the accident
Of his image for his pacient
He knew the cause of every maladye
Were it of cold hete moist or dry
And were engendered of what humor
He was a very parfight practesour
The cause he knew and of his harm the rote
Anon^ he yaf the sikman his bote
For ready always be his apotecarye^
To send him drugges and his lettewaryes
For each of them made other forto win
Her friendship was not new to begin
Full well knew he the old Estulapius
And diascorid and eke Platearius
Old ypocras. haly and eke Galiene
Serapion^ rasis and eke Auicene
Anorrois damascene and Constantyn
Bernard Gatisden and Gilbertyn
Of his diete mesurable was he
For it was of no ^uperfluyte
But of greet norisshinge and digestible
His stody was but litil on the bybyll
In sangwen and in perce I clad with all
Lyned with taffata and whit sandall
And li^il he was of his disp^nce
He kept that he when in the pestelence
For gold in phisik is a cordial
Therefore he loved gold in special
A Good wif there was of beside bat^e
And she was s^md^^l deef: the was scathe
Of cloth making had she such an haunt
She pass^d him of y^^e or of gaunt
In all the pariss^e wif was there non
That to the offrynge before her should goon
And if t^^: did certain wroth was she
Th^n was she out of al charity
Her kerch^uys full f^n were of ground
I durst swear they w^y^d three pound
That on a sunday were on her head
Her h^syn were of fine scarlit reed
Full streyte I teyd and shoos full new
Bold was her face fair and reed of ^ewe
She was a worthy Womman al her live
Hushondis at the chr^che door had she five
Without other company in youth
But her of ned^th not to speak as nowthe
At acres had she been and at Iherusaleme
She had passid thouron many a strong re^e
At rome she had be and at Babiloyne
At saint James in Galis and at Coloyne
She could much of wandrynge in the wey
Gap tothid was she sothly to sey
Up on an Ambeler full esely she sat
I wymplid well and on her head an hat
As brood as it were a bokeler or a targe
A foot mantil about her hippis large
And on her helis a peire of sporis sharp
In feleship could she lawhe and carpe
Of remedies of love she counde perchance
For of that art she could the dance
A Good man there was of Religion
And was a pour parson of a town
But rich he was and holy of werk
He was also a learned man and a clerk
That cristis gospel is trewly would preche
His parishons devoutly would he teache
Benign he was and wonder diligent
And in aduersite full pacient
And such he was proved often sithes
Full loath were he to curse for his tithis
But rathir would he give out of doubt
Unto his pour parishons about
Of his offringe and of his sustenaunce
He could in lityl thing have suffisaunce
Wide was his parish and housis fer a sondir
But he let not for rayn ne for thundir
In sickness ner in myschief to visit
The ferrest in his parish more and lite
Up on his feet and in his hond a staf
This nobil ensample unto his sheep he yaf
That first he wroughte and aftirward taught
Out of the gospel the wordis he caughte
And this figure he ekyd thereto
That if gold ruste what should Iren do
For a priest to be foul in whom we trust
No wonder is a loud man to ruste
And shame it is if a priest take keep
A slotty shepherde and a clean sheep
Well ought a priest ensample to give
Be his clennesse how his sheep should live
Be set not his benefice to hire
And let his sheep acombre in the mire
And run to london to saint Poulis
And seek him a chauntrie for soulis
Other with a bretherhede to be witholde
But duolle at hoom and keep his fold
So that the wolf ne had the maistrye
He was a sheepherde and not a mercenarye
And though he holy were and virtuous
He was not to a sinfulman to despitous
But in his speech discreet and benign
Ne of his techyng dangerous ne digne
To draw ^olk to heaven with fairness
Be good ^nsampyl this was his besinesse
But it (...)e any person obstinat
Whethe(...)t were of high or low astat
Him would he snybbe sharply for the nonys
A better priest I trow nowhere non^ is
He waited aftir no pomp ne reverence
He had no spiced conscience
But cristis lore and his apostelis twelve
He taught but first he followed him selue
With him there was a polowma^ was his brother
That had led of dung many a fother
A true swynker and a good was he
Leuynge in pees and parfit charity
God loved he best with all his heart
At all times they he gamed or smerte
And than his neyghebour right as him self
He would thresshe and thereto dig and delf
For cristis sake for every pour wight
Without hire if it lay in his might
His tithes paid he both fair and well
Of his propir swynk and his catel
In a tabard he rood up on a mere
There was also a reave and eek a Millere
A somp nour and a pardoner also
A Mancipill and my self there was no mo
THe millere was a stout carle for the nonys
Full big he was of braun and bonys
That proved well for ever there he came
At wrastlynge alwey he would have the ram
He was short shuldred a thick quarre
There was no door that he nolde ^eue of the barr^
Or break it at rennynge with his head
His berde as any sow or wey was reed
And thereto b^ood as it were a spade
Up on the cop of his nose he hade
A werte and there ou s^ood a tufte of heris
Read as the beustelis of a sowes eris
His nostrellis blak were and wide
A swerd and a bokeler baar ^e be his side
His mouth as greet as is a furneys
He was a Ia^geler and a ioly hardeys
And that was most of sin and harlotryes
Well could ^e stele corn and toll thryes
And that he had a thomb^ of go^^ pard^
Awhit cote and a blew ho^d weryd he
A bag py^e could he blow and sown
And there with he brought out of town
A Gentyl Mancipyl was there of the tempyl
Of which a catour m^ghte take ensampyl
^o^to ^e ^yse in byinge of vitayl
For ^^eth^r he pa^^e or took be tail
Alg^te he waytyd so on his acate
That he was a^ before and in good state
Now is not that of god a fair grace
That such a lewd mannys wit shall pace
The wisdom of an heep of learned men
Of maistris had he moo than thries ten
That were of law ^^ert and corious
Of which there were a dosen in that house
Worthy to be stuardis of rent and land
Of any lord that is in Engelond
To make him live be his owen good
In honor detles but he were wood
Other live scarsely as him list desire
And forto help all the shire
In any cause that might fall or hap
And this mancipill set al her cappe
A Reave there was a slendir colerik man
His berd is shave as nygh as he can
His heris were be his eris round I shore
His top was dockid lik a pressed before
Full long were his leggis and full lene
Lik a staf there nys no calf I seen
Well could he keep a garner and a bynne
There was non auditour could of him win
Well wiste he be the droughte and be the rayn^
The yeldynge of his seed and of his greyn^
His lordis sheep his neet and his deirie
His swyne his horse his stoor and his pultrie
Was hoolly in this reuys gouernynge
And by his covenant yaf the reckoning
Seth his lord was twenty year of age
There could noman bring him in rerage
There nas bailly ne noon other hyne
That could his sleyghte or his couyne
They were of him a drad as of the death
His wonynge was fair up on an heth
With grene treys shadowed was his place
He could better than his lord purchase
Full rich he was astored pryuely
His lord he could please discretly
To give again to him of his owen good
And have thank and yet acote and an hood
In yongthe he had learned a good mystere
He was a well good wright a Carpentere
This reave sat upon awel good stot
That was al pomel gray and highte scot
A long surco^e of Perce up on him he had
And by his s^de he baar a rusty bladde
Of Norfolk was this reave of which I tell
Be side a town men call Baldiswelle
Tuckyd he was as is a friar about
And ever he rood the hynderest of the rowte
ASompnour with us was in that place
That had a reed cherubyn face
For sawsfleme he was with yen narow
^^ot he was and likerous as a sparow
With blake brows skallid and pilled berd
Of his visage children were a fe^d
There nas qu^ksiluer litarge ne bremstone
Borace ceruse ne oil of tartre none
Ne oynement that ichith or byte
That might help of his welkis white
Ne of his knobbis sittynge in his chekys
Well l^u^d he oynous garleek and lekys
And forto drink reed wine as red as blood
Than would he speak and cry as he were wood
And when he had well drunk the wyn
Than would he speak no word but latin
A few terms had he two or three
That he had learned of ^um man of degree
No wondir is he herd it all the day
And eke ye know well that a Iay
Can clepe watte as well as the pope
But who could him in other thingis grope
Than had he spent al his philosofie
A question quid queris would he cry
He was a gentil harlot and a kind
A better fellow should noman find
He would suffer for a quart of wyn^
A good fellow to have his concubyn^
A twelf monthe and excuse him at the fulle
Full pryuely a finche eke could he pulle
And if he fond owher a good felawe
He would teache him anon to have awe
In such caas of the archedekenes cures
But if mannys soul were in his purs
For in his purs he should punysshyd be
Purs is the archedekenes hell said he
But well I woot he lied in deed
Of cursynge owght each man to dread
For cursynge will sle right as soyling saves
And also ware him of significaint
In danger had he at his owen gise
All the young girlis of the diocyse
And knew of her counseil and was of her read
A garlond he had set up on his head
As greet as it were an alestalk^
A bokeler had he maad him of a Cake
WIth him there rood a gentil pardone^
Of rouncyuale his friend and his comper
That straight was come fro the pope of rome
Full loud he song com hidir lene grom
This sompnour baar to him a styf burdon
Was never trompe of half so greet a soun
This pardoner had here as yelow as wex
And smothe it hyng as does a strike of flex
By ^ounses ^yng his lockis that he had
And there with his sholdris over spradde
But than it lay be Culpous one and one
An hood for cold wered he none
For it was trussed up on his walet
Him thought he rood up on the new get
S^ss^euyld save his cappe he rood albare
^uc^e glarynge yen had he as has an hare
His walet beforn him had he in his lap
A verna^le had ^e sowid up on his cappe
Brecte full of pa^do^ com f^o rome al hoot
Avois he had as small as has a goot
No berd had he ne never should have
As much was it as it were new shave
I trow he were a geldyng or a mare
But of his ^^aft from Berwik unto ware
Ne was there nowher such a pardoner
For in his male he had a pilow beer
Which that he said was our ladies veyll
He said he had a gobet of the seyll
That saint Petir had when that he went
Up on the se til Jesus crist him hent
He had a cross of laton full of stones
And in a glass he had piggis bones
But with thise relics when that he fond
A pour person dwelling up on land
Up on a day he gat him more moan
Than the person gat in monethis three
And thus has he feyned flateriez and Iapis
He made the parson and the pepill his apis
But trewli to tell at the last
He was in church an noble ecclesiast
Well could he read a lesson or a story
But alderbest he song an offretory
For well he wiste when that song was sunge
He most preche and file a while his t^nge
To win silver as he well can
Therefore he song the merier than
NOw have I told you shortly in a claus^

Why that assembled was this company

Strong was the wine and drink us list
A semely man our host was with all
Forto be a marchal in a lords halle
A large man he was with yen stepe
A feyrer burgeys is there non in chepe
Bold of his speech and well was I taught
And of manhood lacked he right naught
Eke thereto was he right a merry man
And aftir s^pp^r to pleyn he began
And spak of myrthe among other things
When that we had made our rekenynges

And granted him without more avyse
And bad him say his verdit as him list

High and low and all be on assent

And there up on the wine was set anon
We dronk and to rest went we echone
With out euy longer taryynge
Amorow when the day began spring
Up roos our host and was al our cok
And gadred us all in a flok

Now let us ride and herkyn what I say
And with that word we riden forth on the way
And ^e began with right a merry chere
And said anon his tale as ye shul here
^Here begins the knyghtis tale.
WHilom as old story tells us
Th^r was a duke that highte Theseus
Of thebes he was lord and governor
And in his time such a conqueror
That gretter was there none under son
Full many a rich contre had he won
That with his wisdom and chiualrye
He conque^^^ all the regne of femenye
That whilom was cleped Cithea
And wedded the queen Ipolita
And brought her home in to his contre
With much glory and solempnite
And eke her young suster Emelye
And thus with victory and melodye
Let I this worthy duke to Athenes ride
And al his oost in arms him beside
And certis if it nere to long to here
I would have told fully the matere
How won was the regne of femenye
Be Theseus and by his cheualrye
And of the great bataille for the nonys
Betwix athenes and amasones
And how beseged was Ipolita
The fair lady queen of Cith^a
And of the feste tha^ was at her wedding
And of the tempest at her hom coming
But al thing I moot as now forbere
I have god woo^ a large feld to ere
And week ^^n the o^^n in the plow
The remenant of my tale is long ynow
I will not let ^k^ none of this rowte
Let every fellow ^elle his tale about
And let se now who shall the souper win
And there I left I w^l again begynn^
THis duke of whom I make mention
When he was come almost in to the town
He was wa^^ as he cast his ye a side
In all his welthe and his most pride
Where that there kneled in the high wey
A company of ladies twey and twey
Each aftir other clothed in clothes blake
But such a d^y and such a woo they make
That in this world nys creature living
That herd such an other weymentynge
And of this cry they would never stentyn
Till they the reynys of his bridyl hentyn
What folk be ye that at mine hom coming
Perturbe me and my feste with cryynge
Qued Theseus have ye so great envy
Of mine honor that thus complain and cry
Or who has you mysboden or offended
Tell me and it shall be amended
And why that ye be clothed thus in blak
The eldest lady of hem all spak
When she had swowned with a dedly chere
That it was rowthe to see and to here
She said lord to whom fortune has give
Victory and as a conqueror to live
Naught greueth us your glory and your honor
But we beseke you of mercy and socour
Have mercy on our woo and distress
Some drope of pity for thy gentilnesse
Up on us wrecchid wommen let now fall
For certis lord there is non of us all
That she ne has be a duchess or a queen
Now be we caytifs as it is well seen
I thanked be fortune and her falls wheel
That non astat ensureth to be weel
Now certis lord to abide your presence
Here in this temple of goddis clemence
We have be waytinge all this fourtenyght
Now help us lord seth it is in thy might
I wrecched wight that weep thus
Was sometime wif of Campaneus
That starf at Thebes acursid be that day
And all we that been in this array
And make all this lamentacion
We losten all our husbondis in that town
Whiles the sege there about lay
And yet now the old creon well away
That lord is now of Thebes that cite
Fulfilled of Ire and iniquyte
He for despit and his tirannye
To do the ded bodies vilonye
Of all our lordis which that been slawe
Has all the bodies on an heep I draw
And wol not suffer hem be non^ assent
Neither to be buried ne to be brent
But makith houndis to ete hem in despyt
And with that word without more respyt
They fallen groflynge and cry pitously
Have on us wrecchid wommen some mercy
And let our sorrow synke in thy heart
This gentil duke of his courser stert
With heart pitous whenne he herd hem speak
Him toughte his heart would break
When he saw hem so pitous and so mate
That whilom were of so great astate
And in his arms he ^em all up hent
And hem comforted in full good intent
And swore his oath as he was true knight
He would do so ferforth his might
Up on the tiraunt Creon him to wreke
That all the pepyl of greece should speak
How Creon was of Theseus y served
As ^e that has his death well deserved
And right anon withouten more abo^d
His baner ^e displayde and forth he rood
To Th^bes ward and al his oste beside
No ner Athenes nolde he goo ne ride
Ne take his ese not fully half aday
But on his wey that night he lay
And sent anon I po^ita the queen
And Emely her young sustir shene
Unto the town of Athenes to dwell
And forth he rides there is no more to tell
HE rood the statu with spear and ^^rge
So shyneth in his whit baner larg^
That all the ^eld^s gliteren up and down
And he his baner born^ is his penon^
Of gold ^ul ri^he in which therwas I beat
The Mytan which he wan in crete
This rich duke this rich conqueror
And in his oste of chiualrye the flour
Till that he came to Thebes and a light
Fer in a f^ld there as he thought to fight
But shortly to speak of this thing
With Creon which was of thebes king
He faught and slow him manly as a knight
In plain bataille and put his folk to fight
And at a sawte he wan the cite aftir
And rent a down wall sparre and raftir
And to the ladies he restored ageyn^
The bodies of her husbondis that were sleyn^
To do obsequyes as tho was the gyse
But it were al to long to douyse
The great clamor and the weymentyng
That the ladies made at the buryyng
Of the bodies and the great honor
That The^eus the nobil conqueror
Does to the ladies when they fro him went
But shortly forto tell is mine intent
When that this worthy duke this Theseus
Has Creon slain and wan Thebes thus
Stille in the field he took al night his rest
And did with all the contre right as him list
He ransaked in the taas of bodies deed
Hem for to strype of harneis and of wede
The pilours did her besinesse and cure
Aftir the bataille and the discomfiture
And befil that in that taas they fond
Through girt with meny a grievous wound
Two young knyghtis lyyng by and by
Both in one harneis wrought full richely
Of which two arcite highte that one
And the other highte Palamon^
Not fully quyk ne fully ded they were
But by her ^otearmur and by her gere
The herowdes knew hem best in special
Alas that they were of the blood ryal
Of Thebes and of fustryn two ybore
Out of the taas the pilours have hem tore
And have hem carried in to the tent
Of Theseus and he full sone hem sent
To Athenes to dwell there in prison
Perpetuel ^e nolde no raunson
And when this worthy duke had thus don
He took his ost and hom he goth anon
With laurer crowned as a conqueror
And there he lives in joy and in honor
Term of his lif what nedith wordis moo
And in a tour with anguysh and with woo
Dwellith Palamon and arcite
For evermore there may no man hem quyte
THus passed year be year day be day
Till it fyl oues in a morning of may
That Emely that fairer was to se
Than is the lily up on the stalk tree
And fressher than may with flouris new
For with the rose color stroof her hew
I not which was the feirer of hem two
Er it was day as was her wont to do
She was arysen and al ready dight
For may wol have no slogard a night
The seson pricketh every gentyl heart
And makes it out of his sleep to sterte
And sithnes a rise to do her obseruauncis
This makith Emely to have remembrauncis
To do honor to may and for to rise
I clothed fressh was she to deuyse
Her yelow here was broided on a tres
Be hynd her bak a long yerd I ges
And in the gardyn at the son vprist
She walked up and down as her list
She gadred flowris part white and read
To make a subtyl chapelet for her led
And as an aungel heavenly she song
The great tour that was so thick and strong
Which of the Castle was chief dungeoun
There as the knyghtis weren in prisoun
Of which I told you and tell shall
Was euene ioynant to the Castle w^ll
There as this Emely had her pleyyng
Bright was the son and clear in that morning
And Palamon this woeful prisoner
As was his wone be leave of his gailer
Was risen and romed in the chambir on hy
In which all the noble cite he sy
And eke the gardyn full of braunchis grene
There as fressh Emely the shene
Was in her walk and rom^d up and down
This sorrowful p^isoner this Palamoun
Goth in the chambir to and fro
And to him self compleyned of his woe
That he was born^ full often he said allas
And so be fyl be adventure and ^aas
That through a wyndow thikke of many a bar
Of yren greet and squaar as any sparre
He cast his yen up on Emelia
And there with as he blente he cryde a
As though he were stongyn to the heart
And with that cry arcite anon up stert
And said cosyn mine what eileth the
That art so pale and dedly on to see
Why ^^yest thou who has do the offense
For goddis love take al in patience
Our prison for it may non other be
Fortune has give us this aduersite
Or ell^^ some wikked aspect or disposicion
Of saturn be some constillacion
Has give us this al they we had sworn^
So stood the heuene when we were born^
We most endure this is the short and plain
This Palamon answered and said again
Cosyn forsothe of this oppinion
Thou have a veyn ymaginacion
This prison causid me not to cry
But I was hurt now through mine eye
Unto my heart that wol my bane be
The fairness of a lady that I see
Yonder in the gardyn romynge to and froo
Is cause of my cryynge and my woo
I not whether she be womman or goddess
But venus it is sothly as I guess
And therewith al o^^^nees down he fill
And said venus if it be thy will
You in this gardyn thus to transfygure
Before me sorrowful wrecche thy creature
Out of this prison help that we may escape
And if it be my destenye so to hape
Be etern world to dye in prison
Of our lynage have some compassion
That is so low I brought be tyranny
And with that word arcyte began espy
Where as the lady went to and fro
And with that sight her beauty hurt him so
That if Palamon were wounded sore
Arcite is hurt as much as he or more
And with a sigh he sighed pitously
The fressh beauty shall sle me suddenly
Of hire that comes in the yonder place
And but I have her mercy and her grace
That I may se her at the least wey
I am but ded there is no more to sey
THis Palamon when he thise wordis herd
Dispitously he looks and ansuerd
Whethir say thou this in ernest or in play
Nay quod arcite in ernest be my fay
God help so me lust full lityl to play
This Palamon began knytte his browis tway
Hit were quod he to the no great honor
Forto be falls ne to be a traitor
To me that am thy cosyn and thy brother
I sworn^ ^ul deep and each of us to other
That never forto dien in the peyn
Till that the death depart shall us tweyn
Neither in love to hyndre other
Ne in no evil caas my leave brother
But that thou sholdest truly further me
In every caas as I should further the
This was thyn oath and mine certain
I woot it well thou dare it not withsayn
Thus art thou of my counsel without doubt
And now thou woldist falsely be about
To l^ue my lady whom I love and serve
And eu^r shall till mine heart sterue
Now certis falls ^rcite thou shall not so
I loved her first and told the my woo
(...) to my couns^^l and to my brother sworn^
I s^^pos^ thou louedist her here b^^orn^
Wost thou not well the old clerkis saw
That who shall ^eue alouer any law
Love is gretter law be my pan
Than may be give to any erthly manne
And therforee positif law in such degree
Is broken alday for love in each degree
Aman most nedis love magre his head
He may not fle it though he should be ded
Al be she maid widow or wife
And eke it is not likly al thy life
To stand in her grace no more shall I
For well thou wost thy self verily
That thou and I be dampened to prison
Perpetually us gayneth no raunson
Ne strive as did the houndis for the bone
They faught alday and yet her part was none
There came a curre while that they were so wroth
And ^aar awey the bone betwix hem both
And therefore at the kyngis court my brother
Each man for him self there is non^ other
Love if thou list for I love and shall
And sothly lief brother this is al
Here in this prison most we endure
And every of us take his adventure
Great was the stryf and long betwix hem twey
If that I had leyser forto sey
But to the effect it happed on a day
To tell it shortly as I may
A Worthy duke that highte Parotheus
That fellow was to duke Theseus
But of that story list me not to endite
Duke Parotheus loved well arcite
And had him know at thebes year be year
And finally at the request and prayer
Of Parotheus without euy raunson
Duke Theseus leet him out of prison
Freely to go where him list over al
In such a gyse as I you tell shall
This was the forward plainly to endyte
Betwix duke Theseus and arcyte
That if so were that arcite were found
Ever in his life be day or be stounde
In any contre of this duke Theseus
And ^e were caught it was acorded thus
That with a swerd he should lose his head
T^er was non oher remedy ne reed
But takith his leave and hounward him spedde
Let him bewaar his life lith to wedde
Hit were a great thing to te^^^ and to wite
How great sorrow now suffrith arcite
Now is me shapyn eternally to dwell
Naught in purgatory but in hell
Allas that ever lenew I parotheus
For ^llis had I duelt with Theseus
I (...) in his prison with moo
^han had I be in ease and not in woo
Only the sight of her whom that I serve
T^^ugh that I never her grace may deserve
Wol^e have suffised right ynow for me
O dear cosyn Palamon quod he
Thyn is the victory of this adventure
Full bli^^ul in prison may thou endure
In prison nay certis but in paradyse
Well has fortune to the turned the dyse
That has the sight of her in mine absence
For possible it is sethnes thou have her presence
And art a knight worthy and able
That by some caas syn fortune is chaungeable
Thou may some time to thy desire atteyne
But I that am exiled and bareyne
Of all grace and so in great despeir
That there nys water earth fire ne eir
Ne creature that of hem made is
That may me help or comfort do I wis
Well ought I sterue in wanhope and distres
Far well my lif my lust and my gladness
Allas why playnen men so in com^une
Of purneaunce of god or of fortune
That yeueth hem often in meny wise
Well better than hem self can deuyse
Some men desire to have richesse
That cause is of murdre or great sickness
And some man would out of his prison feyn
That in his house of his meyne is sleyn
Infynyt harms be in this matere
We woot not what thing we pray here
We faren as he that drunk is as a mous
A dronken man wot well he has an house
But he woot not which is the right wey thider
To a dronkyn man the wey is slidir
And certis in this world so fare we
We sekyn fast aftir felicite
But we go wrong full often sikirly
Thus may we say all and namely I
That went have had a great oppinion^
That and I might escape out of prison^
Than had I be in Joy and in parfyt hele
There now I am exiled fro mine hele
Sithnes I may not se you Emelye
I ne am but ded there is no remedy
Upon that other side Palamon
When that be wiste arcite was goon
Such sorrow he makith that the great tour
Resouned of his yellyng and his clamor
The pure feteris on his shynys great
Were of his bittir salt teris wete
Allas quod he arcite cosyn mine
Of al our strif god woot the fruit is thyn
Thou walkist now in thebes at thy large
And of my woo you yeuest lityl charge
Thou may say thou have wisdom and manhede
Assemble all the folk of our kynrede
And ^ake war so sharp on this contre
That by some adventure or by some trete
Thou may have her to lady and to wife
For whom I must nedis lose my life
For as by w^y of possibilite
Sithnes thou art at large and of prison fre
And art a lord great is thyn advantage
More than is mine shit her in a cage
For I may weep and wayle whylis tha^ I live
With all the woo that prison may me give
And eke with pain that love me yeuyth also
That doublith al my tourment and my woo
Therewith the fire of ielosye up stert
With ynne his breast and hent him by the heart
So woodly that he likly was to behold
The box tree or the ash tree ded or cold
That said se o cruel goddis that govern
The world with bidydng of your word eterne
And written in the tabyl of the athament
Your parliament and your etern^ gaudent
What is mankind more unto you hold
Than is the sheep that ronkith in the fold
For slain is man right as anothir be
And duellith eke in prison and in arest
And has sickness and great aduersite
And often time giltlees parde
What gouernaylle is in this prescience
That giltlees turmentith Innocence
And yet encresith this al my penance
That man is bound to his obseruaunce
For goddis sake to lettyn of his will
There as a be may al his will fulfill
And when a b^est is ded he has no pain
But aftir his death man may weep and plain
Though in this world he have care and woe
Without doubt it may stand so
The ansuer of this let I to deuynes
But well I woot that in this world great pyne is
Allas I se a serpent or a thief
That many a true man has do myschief
Goon at his large and where him list may turn
But I must be in prison thourgh saturn
And thourgh him unhappy and eek wood
That has destroid well nygh all the blood
Of thebes with his wast wallis wide
And venus sletth me in that other side
For Ielosie and feer of him and arcite
Now wol I stynte of Palamon alite
And let him in his prison stille duelle
And of ^rcite forth I wol you tell
The somer passed the nyghtis wax long
Encrecith he doubil wise the peynes strong
Both of the lover and of the prisoner
I ne woot who has the wofuller myster
For shortly to say of this Palamon
Perpet^elly is dampened to prison
In cheyn^s and in feters to be ded
And arcite is exiled on his head
For ^uermore and out of that contre
For never more shall be his lady se
You lovers axe I now this question
Who has the worse of arcite and of Palamon
That one may se his lady day be day
But in prison must he dwell always
That other where him list may ride or goo
But se his lady shall he never moo
Now demyth as ye list ye that can
For I will tell forth as I began
When that arcite to Thebes come was
Full often aday he swelte and said allas
For se his lady shall he never moo
And shortly to conclude all his woo
So much sorrow ne has creature
That i^ or shall be while the world may dur^
His sleep his mete his drynk is him beraft
That lene he wax and dry as is a shaft
His yen holow and grisly to be hold
His hew falow and pale as asshyn cold
And solitary he was and ever a lone
And waylinge as he might making his moan
And if he herd song or instrument
Than would he weep he might not stent
So febyl were his spiritis and so low
And changed so that no man could him know
His speech ne his wis though men it herd
As in his gire for all the world it ferde
Naught lik the lovers maladye
Of heris but rathir I lik to many
Engendrid of humor malencolyk
Beforn^ in his cell fantastyk
And shortly turned was al up so down
Both habit and disposicion^
Of him this woeful lover dan arcite
What should I of his woe alday endite
When he endured had a year or two
This cruel turment this pain and woo
At Thebes in his contre as I said
Upon a night in sleep as he him laid
Him thought how that the wynged Mercury
Beforn him stood and bad him be merry
His slepy zerd he baar in hond up right
An hat he baar upon his heris bright
Araid was this god as he took keep
As he was when argus took his sleep
And said him thus to athenes thou shall wend
There is the shape of thy woo an end
And with that word arcite awook and stert
Now trewly how sore that me smert
Quod he to athenes will I fare
Ne for no dread of death shall I spare
To se m^ lady that I serve
In ^er presenc^ recke I not to sterue
And with that word he caughte a mryrour
And saw that changed was his color
And saw his v^sage al in anothir kind
And right anon it ran him in his mind
That sithnes his face was disfugured
Of maladye the which he had endured
He m^ghte well if that he bare him low
Live in athenes e^ermore unknow
And s^ his lady well nyhe day be day
And right anon he changed his array
And clad him as a pour laborer
And a lone save only a pour squire
That knew his priuite and his caas
Which was disguysed pourely as he was
To athenes is he gone the next way
And to the court he went up on aday
And at the gate he profryd his seruise
To drug and to draw and what men would deuyse
And shortly of this matter forto seyn
He fill in office toward a chambirleyn
The which that was dwelling with Emelye
For he was wise and well could aspye
Of every servant which that served there
Well could he hew wode and watir bear
For he was young and mighty for the nonys
And thereto he was strong and big of bonys
To do that euy wight him could deuyse
A year or two he was in this seruise
Page in the Chambir of Emely the brighte
And Philostrat he said that he highte
But half so well a loved man as he
Ne was there non^ in court of his degree
He was so gentyl of condition
That through all the court was his renoun
They said that it were charity
That Theseus would enhaunse his degree
And put him in a worshipful seruise
There that he might his virtue exercise
And thus withyn awhile his name sprung
Both of his dedis and of his tongue
That Theseus has take him so nere
That of his chambir he made him a squyere
And yaf him gold to mayntene his degree
And eke men brought him out of his contre
Fro year to year full pryuely his rent
But honestly and slighly he it spente
That no man wondered how that he it had
And three year in this wise his lif he ladd^
And baar him in pees and eke in war
There was noman that Thes^us had derre
ANd in this bliss let I now arcite
And speak I will of Palamon alite
In derknesse horrible and in strong prison
This s^uen year has sete this Palamon
For pyned what for woo and distress
Who felith dowbyl woo and heaviness
But Palamon that love distreyueth so
That wood out of his wit he ny goth for woo
And eke thereto he is a prisoner
Per^etuel and not only for a year
W^^ cowde ryme in englissh propirly
His matirdom forsothe it am not I
Th^rfore I pass as lightly as I may
I will not taire you all the day
The third n^ght as old bokis sayn
That all this story tellith more and plain
Were it be adventure or destyne
Alas that when a thing is shapyn it shall be
That sone aftir the mydnyght Palamon
Be help of a friend broke has his prison
And flees fro the prison as soon as he may goo
For he had give his gailer drink so
Of clarrey made of a certain wine
With nercotises and Epye of Thebes fine
That half the night though men would him shake
The gayler so slep^e he might not awake
And thus he fleyhe as fast as he may
The night was short and fast be the day
That nedis cost he most him self hyde
And to a grove fast beside
With dredful heart than stalketh Palamon
For shortly this was his oppinion
That in that grove he would him hyde alday
And in the night than would he take his way
To Thebes ward his frendis forto prey
On Theseus to help him werrey
And shortly either he would lose his liff
Or win Emelye to his wiff
This is the effect and the intent plain
Now will I turn to arcite again
That lityl wiste how nygh was his care
Till that fortune had brought him in the snare
The merry lark messanger of may
Salueth in her song the morrow gray
And fity Phoebus risith us so bright
That all the orient laughith of the sight
And with his stremys dries the greues
The silver droppis hanging on the leuys
And arcite that in the court ryal
With Theseus his squire principal
Is risyn and looks on the merry day
And forto do his obseruaunce to may
Remembrynge on the point of his desire
He on his courser stirtinge lik the fire
Is riden in to the feldis him to pleye
Out of the Court were it a mile or tweye
And to the grove of which that I you told^
By adventure his wey he began to hold
To make him a garlond of the greuys
Were it of wodebynde or of hawthorn leuys
And loud ^e song ayens the son shene
May al thy flowris and thy grene
Welcome be thou fressh fair May
In hope that I some grene get may
And fro his courser with a lusty heart
In to the grove full lustely he stert
And in a path he romed up an down
Where as by adventure this Palamon
Was in a bussh that noman might him se
Full sore a ferd of his death was he
No thing knew he that this was arcite
God woot he would have trowed it full lite
But soth is said go sithen is many yeris
That feld has yen and wode has eris
Hit is full fair aman to bear him even
For alday men mete at unset steuyn
For lityl went arcite of his felawe
That was so nygh to herkyn of his saw
When that arcite had romed al his fill
Palamon in the bush now sittith still
And arcite song all the roundel lustily
In to a study he fyl suddenly
As done thise lovers in her queynte giris
Now in the crop and now in the breris
Now up now down as boket in awelle
Right as the friday sothly forto tell
Now it shyneth now it rayneth fast
Right so began guerri venus over cast
The hertis of her folk right as her day
His guery thought so changes his array
Selde is the friday all the woke lik
When that arcite had song he began to sike
And he set him down without euy more
Allas quod he the day that I was bore
How long Juno through thy cruelte
Wilt thou werien thebes the Cite
Alas y brought is to confusion^
The blood ryal of Cadyn and amphion^
Of Cadimis which that was the first man
That Thebes bilt or first the town began
And of the cite first was crouned king
Of his lynage am I and of his ofspryng
Be verray line and of stok ryal
And now I am so kaytyf and so th^al
That he that is my mortal enemy
I serve him and am his squire pouerly
And yet does me Juno welmore shame
For I dar not be know mine owen name
But there as I wont was to highte arcite
Now highte I philostrat not worth amyte
Allas thou fell mars allas Juno
Thus your ire has our lynage al fordo
S^ue only on wrecchid Palamon
That Theseus martrith in prison
And over all this to sle me utterly
Love has his fiery dart so brennyngly
It stikyd thorugh my true careful heart
That shapen was erst my death or my shert
Ye sle me with your yen Emelye
Ye be the cause wherefore that I dye
Of all the remenaunt of mine other care
Ne sect I not the mountaunce of a tare
So that I could do aught to your plesaunce
And with that word he fyl down in a trance
A long time and aftirward up stert
This Palamon that thought through his heart
He felt a cold swerd suddenly glide
For ire he quoke he nolde no lengir abide
And when that he has herd arcites tale
As ^e were wood with face ded and pale
H^ stirt him up out of the bussh thick
And said arcite falls traitor wicke
Now are thou ^ent that love my lady so
For whom that I have this pain and woo
And art my blood and to my counceyl sworn^
And I full often have told the here beforn^
And have be iapyd here duke Theseus
And falsely have changed thy name thus
I will be ded or ellis thou shall dye
Thou shall not love my lady Emelye
But I will love her only and no mo
For I am Palamon thy mortal fo
And though I have no wepyn in this place
But out of prison am stert be grace
That thou sholdist dye of mine hond
For I defy the seuerte and the bond
Which that thou say I have made to the
What verrey fool thynk that love is fre
And I will love hire magre al thy might
But for as much as thou art a knight
And woldist darrayn here be bataille
Have here my truth to morrow I will not fail
Without witinge of any other wight
That here I will be founden as a knight
And bryngen harneis right ynow for the
And chees the best and leave the worst for me
And mete and drink this night will I bring
I now for the and clothis for thy beddynge
And if so be that thou my lady win
And sle me in this wode that I am Inn
Thou may well have thy lady as for me
This Palamon answered I grant hit the
And thus they be departed till amorow
When either of hem has leyd her feith to borow
Occupied out of all charity
O regne that woldist have no fellow with the
Full soth is said that love ne lordship
Will not his thanks have any feleship
We find thus of arcite and Palamon
Arcite is riden anon into the town
And on the morrow anon or it were light
Full pryuely two harneis has he dight
Both sufficient and mete to darreygne
The bataylle in the feld betwix hem tweyne
And on his horse alone as he was born^
He carried the harneis him beforn^
And in the grove at time and place set
This arcite and this Palamon been met
To change began the color in her face
Right as hunters the in regne of trace
That stondeth at the gappe with a spear
When huntyd is the lioun and the bear
And herith him come russhing in the greuys
And b^ckith both bows and eke leuys
And thinkith here comyth my mortal enemy
Without fail he must be ded or I
For either I most sle him act gappe
Or he must sle me if I mys hap
So fer^en they in changing of her hue
As fer as any of hem other knew
There nas no good day ne saluynge
But straight without wordis of rehercyng
Euerich of hem helpith to arm other
As friendly as he were his owen brother
And aftir that with sharp speris strong
They foynen each at other long
Thou myghtist wene that this Palamon
In his fighting were a lioun
And as a cruel tigre was arcite
As wild boris began they to geder smite
That freten whit as foom for ire wood
Up to the ancle fought they in her blood
And in this wise I let hem fighting duelle
And forsooth I will of Theseus tell
The destenye mynyster general
That excusith in the world ouyr all The purneaunce that god has beforn^
So stran^ge it is that though the world had sworn^
The contrary of a thing be ye or nay
Yet sometime it shall fall up on aday
That fallith not eft in a thousand year
For certainly our appetitys here
Be it of pees hate war or love
Al is rewlid be the sight above
This mean I now be mighty Theseus
That forto hunte is so desirous
And namely at the great heart in may
That in his bed there dawid him no day
That he nys clad and ready forto ride
With hunte and horn^ and houndis be his side
For in his hunting has he such delight
That it is al his joy and his appetite
To be him self the great ^ertis ^^ne
For aftir Mars he seruyth now dyane
Clear was the day as I have told or this
And Theseus with all joy and blis
With his Ipolita the fair queen
And Emely I clothyd al in grene
An huntyng ben they riden rially
And to the grove that stood there fast by
In which there was an heart as men him told
Duke Theseus the straight wey has hold
And to the launde he ridith full right
For thider was the heart wont to have his flight
And over abrook and so forth on his way
The duke would have acours of him or twey
With h^undis such as he list to comaunde
And when this duke was come to the launde
Under the son he lokyd and that anon^
He was waar of arcite and Palamon^
That foughten breme as it were bolis two
The bright suerdis went to and fro
So hidonsly that with the least struck
He semyd that it would have fellyd on ook
But what they were no thing he ne woot
This duke with his sporis his courser smote
And at a sterte he was betwix hem two
And pullyd out his sword and said ho
Nomo^^ on pain of lesing of your head
Be mighty mar^^ anon ye shul be ded
That smy^^^h any struck that I may se
But tellith me what myster men ye be
That been so hard^ to fight here
Without Judge or other officere
As though it were in listis rially
This Palamon answerde hastily
And said sire what nedith wordis moo
We have the does deserved both two
Two woeful wre^^his be we and knyghtis
That been encombred of our lyuys
And as thou art a rightful lord and Judge
Ne give us neither mercy ne refuge
But sle me first for saint charity
But sle my fellow eke as well as me
Or ellis him first for they thou know him lite
He is thy mortal fo this is arcite
That fro thy land was banysshed on his head
For which he has deserved to be ded
For this is he that came to thy yate
And said that he highte Philostrate
Thus he has iaped the many a year
And thou have maad him thy chief squire
And this is he that loves Emely
For sithnes the day is come that I shall die
I make pleynly my confession^
That I am that woeful Palamon
That has thy prison broke wickedly
I am thy mortal fo and he am I
That loves so hot Emely the bright
That I will dye here present in her sight
Therefore I axe death of my Iewise
But sle my fellow in the same wise
For both have we deserved to be slain
THis worthy duke ansuerde anon^ agayn^
And said this is a short conclusion^
Your owen mouth be your confession^
Has dampened you and I will it record
Hit nedith not to pain with the cord
Ye shul be ded be mighty mars the read
The queen anon for verray wommanhede
Began forto weep and so deed Emelye
And all the ladies in that company
Great pity was it as hem thought all
That euyr such a chance should be fall
For gentilmen they were and of great astat
And no thing but for love was this debaat
And saw her blody woundis wide and sore
And all cryden both less and more
Have mercy lord upon us wymmen all
And on her bare knees down they fall
And would have killed hem there as they stood
Till at the last slakyd was his mood
For pity renneth sone in gentyl heart
And though he first for ire quoke and sterte
He considered shortly in a clause
The trespass of hem both and eke the cause
And al though that his ire hire gilt acused
Zit in his reason he hem both excused
And thus he thought well that every man
Will help him self in love all that he can
And deliver him self out of prison
And eke in his heart he had compassion
Of wommen for they were ever in one
And in his gentil heart he thought anon^
And soft unto him self he said fie
Up on a lord that will have no mercy
But be a lioun both in word and deed
To hem that been in repentance and dread
As well as a proud dispitous man
That will mayntene that he first began
That lord has litil of discression^
That in such a caas can no diuision^
But weyeth pride and humbles aftir one
And shortly when his ire is thus agon^
He began to look on hem with yen blake and vglye
And spak thise wordis al on hye
The god of love a benedicite
How mighty and how great alord is he
Agayns his might there gayneth non^ obstakyl
He may be clepid a god for his mirakyl
For he can make at his owen gyse
Of every heart as him list deuyse
Lo here this arcite and this Palamon
That queyntly came out of my prison^
And might a lyuyd in thebes ryally
And known I am her mortal enemy
And that here death lith in me also
And yet has love magre her yen two
Brought hem hither both forto dye
Now lokith is not this an high folly
Who may be a fool but if that he love
Behold for goddis sake that sittith above
Se how they blede be they not well arayd
Thus has her lord the god of love hem paid
Her wages and her fees of her seruyse
And yet they wene forto be wise
That serve love for aught that may fall
But this is yet the best game of all
That she for whom they have this Iolite
Can hem therefore as much thank as me
She wot no more of all this ^oot fare
Be god th^n woot a Cu^kow or an hare
But al must be assayd ^oot or cold
A man must be a fool young or old
I woot it be my self full long agoon
For in my time a servant was I one
And therefore sethnys I know of louys pain
And wot how fore hit can a man distreyne
As he that has be caught in this laas
I you foryeue hoolly this trespaas
And at the request of the queen that knelith here
And eke of Emely my ^uster dear
And ye shul both unto me swear
That never ye shall my croune dear
Ne make war on me night ne day
But be my friends in all that ye may
I you foryeue this trespass far and weel
And they him swar his axing eueridee^
And him of lordship and mercy prayde
And he hem grauntyd and thus he said
TO speak of worthy lineage and richesse
Though that she were a queen or a princess
Each of you both is worthy doutles
To wedde when time is but natheles
I speak as for my sustr^ Emely
For whom ye have this strif and this Ielousy
Ye woot your self ye may not wedde two
At onys theygh ye fight ever mo
That one of you al be him loath or lef
He mot go pype in an Iuy lef
This is to say she may not have both
Al be ye never so ielous and so loathe
And for thy I you put in this degree
That each of you shall have his dest^ne
As him his shapyn and herkyn in what wise
Lo here yonre end of that I shall deuyse
My will is this for plat conclusion^
Without any replicacion^
If that you li^^th take it for the best
That euerich of you shall go where him list
Freely without raunsen or danger
And this day fifty wikes fer ne near
Euerich of you shall bring an hundred knight^s
Armed for listys up all rightis
Already to darreyne here be ba^ayll
And this behote I you without fayll
Upon my trowthe and as I am true knight
That whethir of you both has that migh
May with his hundred as I spak of now
That is to sey wh^thir he or thou
Sle his contrary or out of listys drive
Him shall I give Emely to wyue
To whom that fortune yeueth so fair a gre
The listis shall I make on this place
And god so wisly on my soul rewe
As I shall euene Judge be and true
Ye shul non other end with me make
That one of you shall be ded or take
And if ye think this is well said
Says your auys and hold you paid
This is your end and your conclusion
Who lokith now lighty but Palamon
Who spryngeth up for joy but arcite
Who cowde tell or who could endite
The joy that made is in this place
When Theseus had do so fair a grace
But down a knees went every wight
And thanked him with all her might
And namely the Thebans often sith
And thus with good hope and heart blithe
The^ take her leave and homward they ride
To Thebes with old wall is wide
I trow men would it deem negligent
Zyf I foryete to tell the intent
Of Theseus that goth so besily
To make up the listis ryally
That such an nobyl enter as it was
I dar well say in this world there nas
The curuyt a mile there of was about
Wallid with stoon and diched round about
Round was the shappe in manner of a compass
Full of degrees the highest of sixty paas
That when aman was set in on degree
He lets not his fellow forto se
Estward there was a gate of marbil whit
Westward ^uche another appositit
And shortly to conclude such a place
Was non^ in earth in so lityl space
For in the land there was no craftis man
That gemetrie or ars metric can
Ne portreture ne keruar of Images
That Theseus ne yaf mete drink and wages
The enter forto make and deuyse
And forto do his ryte and his sacrifice
He Estward has up on the gate above
In worship of venus goddess of love
Do make an auter and an Oratory
And on the westward in memory
Of marce has he maad such anothir
That cost large of gold a fothir
And northward in a tour of the wall
Of whit alabastre and reed coral
An Oratory rich forto see
In worship of dyane goddess of chastity
Has Theseus do wrought in nobil wise
But yet had I forgete to deuyse
The nobill keruynge and the portreturis
The shap the countenance and the figuris
That weren in the Oratoryes three
First in the tempil of venus thou may se
Wrought in the wall full petously to be hold
The brokyn slepis and the sighis cold
The sakryd terys and the weymentynge
The fiery strokys and the desirynge
That loves folks in this world enduryn
The oaths be her couenauntis assuren
Plesaunce hope desire and fool hardiness
Beauty and yongthe baudry and richesse
Charmys and sorcerye lesinges and flaterye
Dispense besinesse and Ielowsye
That wered of yelow gold a garlond
And a Cuckoo sittyng on her hond
Fees^is instrumentis carollis and daunsis
^ust and array and all the circumstauncis
Of love which that I rekene and shall
Be ordir were peynted on the wall
And mo than I can make mention
For sothly all the mount of sitheon
Th^re venus has her principal dwelling
Was showed on the wall h^re portreyyng
With all the joy and all the lustiness
Naught was for^eten the Porters idelnesse
Ne Narcysus the fair yore agoon
Ne yet the folly of ^yng Salamon
The enchauntement of Medea and hardynesse
Of Jason I will not now express
Ne of turnus with his hard fire courage
The rich Cresus caytifs in seruage
Thus may ye se that wisdom ne riches
Beauty sleyghte strength ne hardiness
Ne may with venus hold champartye
For as she list the world may she gye
So all these folk caught were in her lase
Till they for woe full often said allas
Suffiseth these ensamplis one or two
And thowgh I could rekene a thousand mo
The statu of venus glorious for to se
Was maad fletynge in the large se
And fro the nauyl down she was
With wawis bright as any glass
A cotel in her right hond had she
And on her head full semely on to se
A rose garlond fressh and well smellyng
Above her heed douues also fleyng
Beforn^ her stood her sone cupido
Upon his shuldris wyngis had he two
And blind he was as it is of^e seen
A bow he baar and arowes cleen
Why should I not eke tell of the wall
The portreyynge that was on hit all
With in the tempyl of mighty mars the read
Al was peynted the wallis in length and bread
Like to the Estris of the grysly place
That hight the great tempyl of mars in trace
In that cold northern frosty regioun
There as mars has his souereyn mansion^
First on the wall was peyntyd a forest
In which there dwellith neither man ne best
With knotty and knarry bareyn treys old
Of stubbis sharp and hidous to behold
In which ran as a wymbyl in a swowe
As though it a storm were should breast every bow
And downward on an hill under abent
There stood the tempyl of marce armypotent
Wrought al of burnyd steel the which the enter
Was long and straight and gladly forto se
And there out came a rage and such a veyse
That it made all the gatis forto reyse
The northeren light in at the door shon
For wyndow on the wall was there non
Through which men might any light disserne
The doris were al of athemaundis eterne
I clenchid overthwart and endlonge
With Iren forto make it strong
Every pyler the tempyl forto sustain
Was tonne greet of yren bright and shene
There saw I first the derk ymagenyng
Of felony and all the compassing
The cruel ire reed as any glede
The pyke purs and eke the pale read
The smyler with the kn^f under the cloak
The shepen brennyng with the blak smoke
The treson of the murdryng in the bed
The opyn werris with woundis all bled
Contak with blody knyf and sharp manace
Al full of chirkyng was the sorry place
The sleer of him yet saw I there
His heart blood has bated al his chere
The nayl I drive in the shode an highte
The cold death with mouth gapynge up right
A myddyl of the tempil sat myschaunce
With discomfort and sorry contenaunce
Yet saw I woodnesse lawghyng in his rage
The hunter strangled with the wild boris courage
The sow fretyng the child in the cradil
The cook I scalded for his long ladil
Naught foryetyn was the infortune of Mars
The carter over riden with his owen horse
Under the wheel full low he lay adoun
There were also of martirs destructioun
The harbor the boteler and the smyth
That forged sharp swerdis in the stith
And al above depeynted in a tour
The high conquest sittynge in great honor
With the sharp swerd over his head
Hanging be a subtle twyned thread
Depeynted was there the slaughtir of Julius
O great Nero and of antomus
Al be that time they were vnborn^
Yet was her death peynted there beforn^
Be manassynge of Marce right be figure
So was it showed right be portreture
As it is depaynted in the ser^lis above
Who shall be sleyn or ded for love
Suffiseth on ensampyl in stories old
I may not rekene all though I would
The statu of Mar^e up on a carte stood
Armyd and lokyd grym as he were wood
And over his head there shynen two figurys
Like unto the figure of virgynys
That one puella hight that other Julius
Thies god of armies was arayd thus
A wolf there stood beforn him at his feet
With yen read and of aman he eet
With subtle pensel was peyntyd this story
In redowndynge of Marce and of his glory
Now to the tempyl of dyane the chaste
As shortly as I can I will me haste
To ^elle you all the descripcion
^e^^yntyd on the wallis up and down
Of hunting and of shamefast chastity
There saw I how woeful Calistope
When that dyane greuyd was with here
Was turned fro womman in to a bear
And aftir was she maad the lood sterre
Thus was ^t peynted I can say no far
Her sone is eke a sterre as men may se
There saw I dyane turned until a tree
I mean not the goddess dyane
But Pen^^s daughter which that highte dyane
There saw I atheon an heart I makyd
For vengeance that he saw dyane al nakyd
I saw how that houndis have him caught
And fretyn him for that they knew him naught
Yet I peynted was a lityl furthermore
How athalante huntyd the wild bore
And meliager and meny other moo
For which Diane wroughte him care and woe
There saw I many another wonder story
The which me list not draw in memory
This goddess on an heart high is sete
With small houndis about her fete
And underneath her feet she had a moan
Wexynge it was and should wane sone
In gaudy grene her statu clothed was
With bow in hond and arowes in caas
Here yen cast she full low a down
There pluto has his derk regioun
A womman trauelynge was here beforn^
But for her child so long was vnborn^
Full pitously Lucyna began she call
And said help for thou may best of all
Well could he peynte lively that it w^oughte
With meny a floreyn he these huwis boughte
NOw ben thise listis maad and Theseus
That at his great cost has arayd thus
The templis and the auters eueridel
When it was done it likyd him well
But stynte I will of Theseus alite
And speak of Palamon and of arcite
The day approchith in here attourneyynge
That euerich should an hundrid knights bring
The bateylle to darreyne as I you told
And til Theseus here covenant forto hold
Has euerich of hem brought an hundrid knights
Well I armed for the werre at al rightes
And sikirly there trowed many aman
That neuyr sithnes the world began
As forto speak of knyghthood of her hond
As fer as god has made see and land
Nas of so few so nobyl acompany
For every wight that loved chyualrye
And would his thankys have passing name
He prayde that he might be of that game
And well was him that thereto chosyn was
For if there fyl to morrow such a caas
Ye know well that every lusty knight
That loves paramouris and has his might
Were ^t in engelond or ellis where
They would her thankys willen to be there
To fight for a lady a benedicite
Hit were a lusty s^ghte forto se
And right so ferthe they with Palamon
With him there went knyghtis many ^on
Some would be armed in habergeon
Some in breast place and in bright gippon
And some wol have a p^^r of platis large
And some would have spruse sheldis and targe
Some would be armed on his leggis well
And have an ax and a mace of steel
There is no new gyse but it was hold
Armed were they as I have told
Eueriche aftir his owen oppinion
There may thou se coming with Palamon
Ligurge him self the king of trace
Blak was his berd and manly was his face
The cerclis of his yen in hes heed
They glowden^ betwix yelow and reed
And like a griffyn looked he about
With kempt heris in his browis stout
His lymes great his brawn^ hard and strong
His shuldres broad his arms round and long
And as the gyse was in his contre
Full high up on a chare of gold stood he
With four white bolis in the trace
Instead of Cote armure in his harnase
With naylis yelow and bright as any gold
He had a bear skyn cool blak for old
His long heris were kempt behynd his bak
As any raven feather it shoon^ for blak
A wrethe of gold arm great of huge weyghte
Up on his head sat. with many a stone bright
Of fyn rubyes and of fyn diamantee
About his chare there w^^te alauntes
Twenty and mo as great as any steer
To honte at lioun or ellis at the deer
And followed him with mosel fast I bound
Colers of gold and torettis filyd round
An hundrid lordis he had in his rowte
Armed well as knyghtis stern and stout
WIth arcite as men in story find
The strong Emetrus the king of Inde
Up on abay stead I trappid al in steell
Armed with a cloth of gold I diapred well
Came ridynge the god of armies Marce
His cote armur was of cloth of tarce
Cowchid with perlis white round and great
His sadyl was of brent gold new y beat
A mantelet on his shuldris hanging
Bret full of rubyys bright as fire spryngyng
His brighte cryspe heris like ryngys were run
And that was yelow and glitered as the son
His nose was high his yen bright and grym
His lippis round his color sanguyn
A few frakelis in his face were spreynt
Betwix yelow and somdeel blak meynt
And as alioun he lokyd about fast
Of.x^v. year of age I him cast
His berd was well begone forto spring
His throat was as a trompe sownynge
Up on his ^ed he weryd of laurer grene
A garlond fressh and lusty forto seen
Upon his head he baar for his dedwyte
An egle as any lily whit
An hundred knights had he with him th^re
Al armed sane her hedis and al her gere
Were richely arrayed in all manner thingis
Trustith well that erlis dukes and kyngis
Were gadred in this nobyl company
For love and ^ncrece of cheualrye
About this king there ronnen on every part
Well many tame liouns and libart
And in this wise the lordis all and some
Been on the sunday to the cite com
About prime and in the town a light
This Theseus this duke this worthy knight
When he had brought hem in to the cite
And ynned hem euerich at his degree
He festith hem and does hem great labor
To ese hem and to do hem al honor
That man ne woman ne no manner wight
Of none astat so could amend it
The mynstralcye the seruise at the feste
The great giftis to the most and lest
The rich array of Theseus Paleys
Ne who fat first ne last up on the deys
Or what feirest or best daunsynge
Or which of them can best dance or sing
Ne who most felingly speaks of love
What hawkys sit on the perchis above
What houndis lain in the slour adoun
Of all this make I no mencion^
But of the effect that thinks me best
Now comyth to the point harken if ye list
THe sunday at night or day began to spring
When Palamon herd the lark sing
All that it were not day be houris two
Unto the temple purposes he to go
With hool heart and with an high courage
Is risen to wend on his pilgremage
To the blisful Sithea benign
I mean venus honorable and digne
And in her hour he walked forth a pace
Unto the listis there the temple was
And down he knelith and with humble chere
And with heart sore he said as ye shul here
Feyrest of feyre o lady mine venus
Daughter to Iouis and spouse to vlcanus
That gladdest all the mount of sitheon
For that love that thou had to a down
Have pity on my bitter teris smert
And take mine humble prayer at thy heart
All as I have no length forto tell
The effect ne the turment of mine hell
M^n heart may not mine harmys be wreye
I am so sorrowful that I can not seye
But lady bright that know well
My thought and see the harmys that I feel
Considere this and vewe up on my sore
As wisly as I shall for evermore
Enforce my might thy true servant to be
And hold werre lady with chastity
That I make mine awwe so ye me help
I keep not of armies forto yelpe
Ne I axe to morw forto have victory
Ne renoun in this caas ne veynglorye
Of pryse of armies to blow up and down
But I would fully have possession
Of Emely and dye in thy seruise
Find thou the manner how and what wise
I recche not but if it may better be
To have victory of them or they of me
So that I have my lady in mine armies
For though so be the mars be great god of armies
Your virtue is so greet in heuene above
That if you list I shall have my love
Thy tempyl wol I worship euermo
And on an auter were I ride or go
I will do sacrefice and firis beat
And if ye will not so my lady sweet
Than pray I the to morrow with a spear
That arcite me through the heart bear
Than recke I not when I have lost my lif
Though that arcite win here to his wife
This is the effect and the end of my prayer
Give me my lif my blissed lady dear
When that the orison was don of palamon^
His sacrefice he did and that anon^
Full petously with all circumstaunces
All tell I not as now his obseruaunces
And all the statu of venus shoke
And made a sign whereby he took
That his prayer acceptid was that day
For though the figure shewde delay
Yet wiste he well that grauntyd was his bone
And with glad heart he went him hom sone
The third hour equal that Palamon^
Began to venus tempil forto gone
UP roos the son and up roos Emely
And to the tempil of diane began hye
Her maidens that with her thider were lad
Full redely with hem fair clothis they had
Theseus clothis and the ^enuaunt all That to the sacrifise longyn shall
The horns full of methe as was the gyse
There lackyd naught to don her sacrifise
Smokyng the tempyl full of clothis feir
This Emely with heart deboneir
Her body with water in a well
But how she did there I dar not tell
But hit be any thing in general
And yet it were a game to here it al
To him that meneth well it were no charge
But it is good aman to be at his large
Her bright ^eer was kempt and vntressed al
And a crown of grene oak serial
Up on her head set full fair and mete
Two firis on the anter began she beat
And did here things as men may be hold
In state of Thebes and in bokis old
When kyndeled was the five with pitous chere
Unto dycine she spak as ye may here
O chaste goddess of the wode grene
To whom both heuene and earth and see is seen
Queen of the regne of pluto derk and low
Goddess of maidens that my heart have know
Full many a year and wotist what I desire
As keep me fro the vengeance of thy fire
That atheon aboughte trewly
Chaste goddess well wotist thou that I
Desire to be amaiden al my life
Ne never wol I be love ne wife
I am thou wotist yet of thy company
Amaiden and love huntyng and venory
And forto wal^yn in the wodis wild
And not to be a wife and be with child
Naught will I know no company of man
Now help me lady sithnes thou may and can
For the three fourmes that thou have in the
And Palamon that has such love to me
And eke arcite that loves me so sore
This grace I pray the withouten more
As send love and pees betwix hem two
And fro me turn awey heart hertis so
That al her hot love and her desire
And al her besy turment and al her fire
Be queynt or turned in another place
And if so be thou will do me no grace
Or if my destenye be shapen so
That I shall nedis have on of hem two
As send me him that most desires me
Behold goddess my clean chastity
The bittir teris that on my ^hekis fulle
Sithnes thou art a maid and keeper of us all
My maidenhed thou keep and well conserve
And whiles I live a maiden will I the serve
Thise firis brenne up on the auters clear
While Emely was thus in her praiere
But suddenly she saw a sight queynt
For right anon on of the fyris queynt
And quyckyd again and aftir that anon
That oher fire was queynt and al agon
And as it queynt it made a whisshing
As done these wete brondis in her brennyng
And at the brondis end out ran anon
As it were dropis blody many on^
For which so sore aghast was Emely
That she was almost mad and began to cry
For she ne wiste what it signified
But only for feer thus has she cry^d
And wept that it was pity to h^re
And therewith al dyane began appear
With bow in hond right as an hunteres
And said daughter stynt thyn heaviness
Among the goddis an hygh^ it is affermed
And by etern^ word written and confermed
Thou shall be weddid until one of two
That have for the so much care and woo
But unto which of hem may I not tell
Fare well ^or I may no lenge^ dwell
The fyris which on mine anter brenne
Shul the declarer or thou go hen
Thyn adventure of love as in this caas
And with that word the arowes in the caas
Of the goddess clateren fast and ring
And forth she went and made a vanysshinge
For which this Emely astonyed was
And said what amounts this case
I put me under thy protection^
Dyane and thy disposicion^
And hom she goth anon the next wey
This is the effect there is no more to sey
And in the hour of Mars after this
ARcite unto the tempil walked is
Of fyres of marce to do his sacrifise
With all the rightis of his paynem wise
With pyetous heart and high deuocion^
Right thus to marce he said this orison^
O strong god that in the regnes cold
Of trace honored art and lord I hold
And have in every regne and every land
Of armies all the bridil in thy hond
And hem fortunest as the list best deuyse
Accept of me my pyetous sacrifise
If so be that my thought may deserve
And that my might be worthy to serve
Thy godhede that I may be on of thyn
Than prey I the rewe on my pyn
For that pain and that hot fire
The which that whilom brendist for desire
When that thou use did the beauty
Of feyre young fressh venus fre
And had of her in thy armies thy will
And though the onys a time mys fille
When vlcanus had caught the in his laas
And fond the liggynge be his wif alas
For that sorrow that was in thy heart
Have rowthe as well up on my peynys smert
I am young and vnkonnynge as thou wost
And as I trow with love offendid most
Than ever was any liuys creature
For she that does me all this woe endure
Ne recchith never whether I synke or flete
And well I woot or she me mercy hete
I must with strength win here in place
And well I wot without help and grace
Of the may not my strength avayle
Than help me lord to morrow in my battle
For that fire that whilom brent the
As well as that fire now brennyth me
And do that I to morrow have victory
Mine the trauayl and thyn be the glory
Thy souereyn tempyl will I most honouren
Of any place alwey and most labowryn
In thy plesaunce and in thy craftis strong
And in thy tempyl I will my baner honge
And all the armies of my company
And evermore until that I dye
Eterne fire I wol beforn^ the find
And eke to this avowe I will me bind
My berd my here that hangith long adoun
That never yet felt offensioun
Of ^asour ne of shere I will the give
And be thy true servant whilis I live
Now lord have rowthe up on my sorowis sore
Y^ue me the victory I axe no more
The prayer stynt and arcite the strong
The ringis that on the tempil door hong
And eke the doors clatered so fast
Of which arcite somewhat him agaste
The firis brende up on the auters bright
That it began all the tempil forto light
A sote smell anon the ground up yaf
And arcita anon his hond up gaf
And more encence in to the fire cast
With other rightis and at the last
The statu of marce began his hanberk ringe
And with that sown he herd a morning
Full low and dym and said victory
For which he yaf to marce honor and glory
And thus with joy and hope well to fare
Arcite anon to his Inn is fare
As fayn as foul is of the bright son
And right anon such strif is there begone
For that granting in heuene above
Betwix venus goddess of love
And Marce the stern god armypotent
That Iubiter was fayn it to stynte
Till that the Pale Saturnus the cold
That knew so many of auenturis old
Fond in his experience and art
That he full sone has plesed every part
As soth is said^ eld has great advantage
In eld is both wisdom and usage
Men may the old out renn^ but not out read
Saturn anon to stynte strif and dread
Al be it that it is ayens his kind
Of all this strif he can remedies find
My dear daughter dear quod Saturn
My course that has so wide forto turn
Has more power than has any man
Mine is the drenchynge in the sea so wan
Mine is the prison in the derk cote
Mine is the strangeling and hangyng be the throat
The murmur and the chorlis rebellynge
The groynynge and the pryue enpoysonynge
I do vengeance and pleyn correction
Whiles I dwell in the sign of the lion
Mine is the ruin of the high halles
The falling of the touris and of the wallis
Up on the mynour and up on the Carpenter
I slough Sampson shaking the pyler
And mine ben the maladyes cold
The great treson and the castis old
My lokynge is the fader of pestelence
Now weep no more I shall do my diligence
That Palamon that is thyn owen knight
Shall have his lady as thou him behight
And marce shall keep his knight yet natheles
Betwix you there must be sometime pees
Al be ye not of on complexion
That causith alday such division
I am thyn al ready at thy will
Wep^ now no more I will thy lust fulfille
Now wol I stynte of the gods above
Of marce and venus gods of love
And tell you al pleynly as I can
The great effect of which I began
GReet was the feste in actenes that day
And eke the lusty seson of may
Made every wight to be in such plesaunce
That all that month Just they and dance
And spenden it in venus high seruise
But be cause that they sholden arise
Erly forto se the great sight
Unto her rest went they at night
And on the morrow when day began spring
Of horse and noise harneis and claterynge
There was in hostelries al about
And to the Paleys there ridith many aroute
And lordis up on stedis and Palfreys
There may thou se deuysinge of harneys
So vncowthe and so rich and well
Of goldsmythrye of browderye and that subtel
The sheldis bright tes^eris and trappours
Gold hewed helmes hawberkis and cote armours
Raymg the speris and helmes bokelyng
Guydyng of sheldis with leyners lasynge
There as need is they were no thing Idyl
The fomy stedes on the goldyn bridyl
Alwey gnawynge and fast the armerers also
With file and hamer prikyng to and fro
Yemen on sote and knaves many on
With short staves thick as they may gone
Pipis trompis naconers and clarion^s
That in the bataylle blew blody sown^s
The paleys full of pepyl up an down
Here three here. ten holdyng her question
Demynge of the theban knyghtis two
Sum said thus some said it shall be so
Some held with him with the blak berd
Some with the ballyd. some with the thick herid
Some said he looked grym and he would fight
He has a sparth of.xx. pound of wighte
Thus was the halle full of demenynge
Long aftir that the son began to spryng
The great Theseus that of his sleep is wakyd
With mynstralsie and noise that was maked
Held yet the chambir of his paleys rich
Till that the theban knyghtis both y liche
I honored were and in to the Paleys ^et
Duke Theseus is at the wyndow set
Araid as he were god in trone
The pepyl preced thiderward full sone
Him forto seen and his high reverence
And eke to harkyn his hest and his sentence
An herowde on a skaffold made an O
Till that the noise of the pepyl was do
And when he saw the pepyl of noise al stille
Thus shewde he the mighty dukes will
The lord has of high discression
Considered that it were destruction^
To gentil blood to fightyn in this wise
Of mortal bataille now in this empryse
Wherefore to escape that they should not dye
He will his first purpos modifye
Noman therefore on pain of losyng his lif
No manner shot. ne pollax. ne short knyf
Unto the listis bring. ne thider send
Ne short swerd forto styke bytende
Ne noman to draw ne bear be his side
Ne noman shall to his felaw ride
Foynyng if him list on foot him self to wreke
Ne noman so hardy this ordenaunce forto break
And he that is at myschief shall be take
And not slain. but brought to the stake
That shall be ordained on either side
But thider he shall be force and there abide
And if so fall the cheefteyn be take
On either side or ellis sleth his make
No longer shall the turneyyng last
God speed you goth on and leith on fast
With long swerdis and maces fight your fill
Goth now your wey this is the lordis will
The vois of the pepyl towchid heuene
So loud cryde they with mysde steven
God save such a lord that is so good
He willith no destruction of blood
Up goth the trumpis and the melodye
And to the listis ridith this company
Be ordenaunce thourgh out the cite large
Hanging with cloth of gold and not with sarge
Full like a lord this nobyl duke began ride
These two the bans on either side
And aftir rood the queen and Emely
And aftir hem of ladies another company
And aftir hem comunes each aftir his degree
And thus they pass through the cite
And to the listis come they betyme
Hit is not of the day yet fully pryme
When set Theseus was rich on high
Ipolita the queen and Emelie
And other ladies in degrees abowte
Unto the setes passes all the rowte
And aftirward through the yates of Mart
Arcite and eke the hundred of his part
With baner reed is entered right anon
And in that selue moment Palamon
Is under venus estward in that place
With baner and hardy chere of face
In all the world to seek up and down
So euene without variacioun
There nere such companyes tweye
For there was non so wise that could seye
That any had of other advantage
Of worthiness ne estate ne of age
So even were they chosen forto guess
And in two raungis feire they hem dress
And when that her names red were euerichon
That in her noumbre gile was there noon^
Tho were the yatis shyt and cride was loud
Does now your deuer young knyghtis proud
The herowdes left her prikyng up and down
Now ryngyn trompis loud and clarioun
There is no more to sey but est and west
In goth the speris full sadly in the rest
There shyueryn shaftis up on sheldis thikke
He felith through the heart spon the prik
Up springith speris twenty foot on highte
Out goth the swerdis as the silver brighte
The helmes thereto hewen^ and to shrede
Out brestith the blood with stout stremys read
With mighty maces the bonys they to breast
And through the thickest they throng and threst
There stombelyn stedis strong and down fall
He rollith under foot as does a balle
He foyneth on his foot with his trunchon^
And he hurt lith with his horse adoun
He through the body is ^urt and sithnes take
Magre his heed and brought to the stake
As forward was right there he most abide
Anothir led is on that other side
And sometime does hem Theseus to rest
Hem forto refresshe and drink if them list
Full often aday have the thebans two
To geder y met and wrought either woe
Vnhorsid has each other of hem tweye
There is no tiger in the vale of galefeye
When that her whelpe is stole when it is lite
So cruel on the hunte as is arcite
For ielous heart up on this Palamon
Ne in belmarie there is non so fell alioun
That huntid is or for angir wood
Ne of his pray desirith so the blood
As Palamon to sle his foo arcite
The ielous strokis on her helmys bite
Out renneth blood on both her sides reed
Some time an end there is of every deed
For or the son out of the west went
The strong king Emetrus began hent
This Palamon as he fought with arcite
And made his sweerd deep in his flesh bite
And by the force of twenty was he take
And yolden and draw to the stake
And in the rescous of this Palamon
The strong king Ligurge is born adoun
And king Emetrus for all his strength
Is born out of his sadil a swerdis length
So hiete him Palamon or he were ytake
But al for naught he was brought to the stake
His hardy heart might him help naught
He must abide when he was caught
Be force and eke be composicion
Who soroweth now but this Palamon
That must no more go again to fight
And when that Theseus had seye that sight
He cryde than ho. no more for it is done
Ne non^ shall longer unto his felaw gone
I will be true Judge and not party
Arcite of thebes shall have Emely
That by his fortune has her feir I won
Anon^ there is anoyse of pepil begone
For joy of this so loud and high with all
That it seemed that ye listys should fall
WHat can now fair venus done above
what says she what does the queen of love
(...) wepith so for wantyng of her will
Til that her teris in the listys fill
She said I am a shamed doutlees
Satorne said daughter hold thy pees
Marce has his will the knight has his bone
And by my hood thou shall be esed sone
The trompe^tis with the loud mynstralsie
The he rowdes that full loud houle and cry
Been in her joy for the weel of dane arcite
But herkeneth me and stynti^h alite
Which a mirakil there be fill anon
This ferce arcite has his helm of done
And on a courser forto show his face
He pryked endlong the large place
Lokyng upward up on this Emelye
And she again him cast a friendly ye
For wommen forto speak of comune
They follow all the favor of fortune
And was al in his chere as in his heart
Out of the ground a fire infernal s^ert
From pluto sent a^te request of saturn
For which his horse for f^er began to turn
And l^pte a side and found^yd as he lepe
And or that arcite may take keep
He pighte him on the pomel of his head
That in the place he say as he were ded
His bres^ to brosten with his sadyl bow
As blak he lay as any cole or crow
So was the blood run in his face
Anon he was born^ out of the place
With heart sore to Theseus paleys
The was ^e coruyn out of his harnei^
And in a bed brought full feyre and bliue
For he was yet in memory and alive
And alwey cryynge aftir Emelye
Duke Theseus with all his company
Is come hom to athen^s his cite
With all blis and great solempnite
Al be ^t that this adventure was fall
He nolde not discomforte hem all
Men said eke that arcite should not dye
He should be ^elid of his maladye
And of another thing they were feyn
That of hem all there was non sleyn^
All were they sore hurt and namely one
That with a spear was thrilled the brestbone
The othre woundis and the broke bones
Some had saluys made for the nones
Formaces of herbs and eke sane
They dronkyn for they would her lives hane
For which this nobil duke as he well can
Comfort and honors every man
And made revel all the long night
Unto the strange lordis as it was right
Ne there was holden no discomfytynge
But as a Iustes or a turmentyng
For sothly there was no descomfiture
For faylyng nys but adventure
Ne to be lad be force unto the stake
Un yeldyn and with twenty knyghtis take
On person allone with out mo
And haried forth be arm foot and to
And eke his stead driven forth with stauys
With footmen both yemen and knauys
Hit was a re^^^^d him no velonye
There may noman clepe it a cowardrye
For which anon^ duke Theseus let cry
To styntyn al rancour and envy
The degree as well in o side as in other
And eythir side lyk as other brothir
And yaf hem giftis aftir her d^gre
And fully held a feste days three
And conveyed the knyghtis worthily
Out of his town a journey largely
And hom went every man the right way
There was no more but farwell have good day
But forto speak of Palamon and arcite
Of Palamon will I stynte alite
But swellith the breast of arcite and the sore
Encrecith at his heart more and more
The cloterid blod for any lechecraft
Coruptith and in his bowk is laft
That neither vein blood ne ventosynge
Ne drink of herbis may be his helping
The virtue expulsif or anymall
Fro that virtue I clepyd natural
Ne may the venym void ne expelle
The pipis and his lungis began to swelle
And ever lacert in his breast adoun
He is shent with venyme and corrupcion
Him gayneth nothing forto get his life
He voydeth upward and dounward laxatif
Al is to brosten that regioun
Nature has in him no dominacion
And certeynly there nature wol not wirche
Fare well fesik go bear the man to church
This is al and some arcite must dye
For which he sendith aftir Emelye
And Palamon that was his cosyn dear
Than said he thus as ye shul aftir here
Now may the woeful spiryt in my heart
Declare a point of all my sorowis smert
To you my lady that I love most
Right thus be quethe I the seruise of my ghost
To you abouen every creature
Sithnes that my life may no longer dure
Alas the pain alas the woo strong
That I for you have suffrid and so long
Alas the death. alas my Emelye
Allas the departing of our company
Alas my hertis queen. alas my life
My hertis lady ender of my life
What is the world what axith men to hane
Now with his love now cold in his grane
Alone withouten any company
Fare well my sweet foo my Emelye
And soft take me in your arms tweye
For the love of god and herkenyth what I say
I have here with my cosyn Palamon^
Had stryf and rancour many aday agoon^
For the love of you. and of my ielowsye
And Jupiter so wisly my soul gye
As in this world right now know I non^
So worthy to be loved as Palamon
To serve you and will do al his lif
And if that ever ye shul be a wif
Foryetith not the gentyl Palamon
And with that word his speech was ny agon^
For fro his feet unto his breast was com
The cold of death that has him ouercom
And yet more over for in his arms two
The vital strength is lost and al ago
Save only the intellectis withouten more
That dwellith in his heart sike and sore
Began fail when the heart felith death
Dusshid his yen to and fails his breath
But o^ his lady yet cast he his ye
His last word was mercy Emelye
His spirit chaungith the house and went there
As I came never I can not tell where
There y stynte I am no deuynyster
Of soulis find I not in this registre
Ne me ne list the oppinions to tell
Though y write might y note where they dwell
NOw will I speak forth of Emelye
That soroweth and cries I will not lie
Now wepith Emelye and waylith Palamon
And Theseus his fustir took anon
Swownynge and bare her fro the cors away
What helpith it to tarry forth the day
To tell how she wept both eve and morrow
For in such caas wommen have such sorrow
When that her husbondis be fro hem ago
That for the more part they sorowen so
Or ellis fall in such a maladye
That at the last certainly they dye
Infynyt ben the sorowis and the teris
Of old folk and folk of tender yeris
In all the town for death of this theban
For him there wep^th both child and man
So greet weeping was there non certain
When Ector was brought al fresh I slain
To Troy allas the pity that was there
Cra^chynge of chekys rentynge of here
Why would thou be ded this wymmen cry
And had gold enough and Emelye
No man might glade Theseus
Saving his old fader Egeus
That knew this worldis transmutacion
As he had seen it change up and down
Joy aftir woo and woe aftir gladness
And shewde him ensaumple and liknesse
Right as there deyde never man quod he
That he ne loved in earth in some degree
Right so there lived never man he seyde
In all this world that some time he deyde
This world is but a through fare full of woe
And we be pylgryms passinge to and fro
Death is an end of every worldis sore
And over all this yet said he mykyl more
To this effect full wisely to enhorte
The pepyl that they should hem recomforte
Duke Theseus with all his besy cure
Cast now where the sepulture
Of good arcite may best y makyd be
And eke most honorably in his degree
And at the last he took conclusion^
That there as first arcite and Palamon
Had for love bataylle hem between^
That in that selue grove sweet and green^
There as he had his amerous desirys
His complaynt and for love his hot firys
He would make a fire in the which the office
Funeral he might fully accomplice
And ^eet anon to hacke and ^o hew
The okis old and ^y hem on a rewe
In ^ulpyns well araid forto brenne
His officers with swist feet they run
And riden anon at his commandment
And aftir this Theseus has sent
Aftir a bear and he it over sprad
With clothis of gold the richest that he had
And of the same he clothid arcite
Up on his hondis his glouys white
And on his head a crown of laurer grene
And in his hond a swerd full bright and shene
He laid him bare the visage on the bear
There with he wept that pity was to here
And for the pepyl should se him all
When it was day. he brought him in to the halle
That thorough the cryynge and the sown
Tho came this woeful theban Palamoun
With floterid berd. and ruggid asshy heris
In clothis blak dropped al with teris
And passinge other of weping Emelye
The rewfullest of all the company
In as much the seruise should be
The more nobyl and rich in his degree
Duke Theseus leet three stedis forth bring
That trappid were in steel al gliterynge
And covered with the armies of arcite
Up on the stedis great and white
There satyn folk of which one bare his sheld
Anothir a spear upon his hondis held
The thridde baar with him his bow turkeys
Of brend gold was the caas and the harneys
And riden forth a paas with sorouful chere
Toward the grove as ye shul aftir here
With slak paas and yen read and weet
Through out the cite be the master street
That spread was al with blac wonder hye
Right of the same is the street I wrye
Op on the right hond went old Egeus
And on that other side duke Theseus
With vesselis of gold in her hond full fine
And full of honey mylk. blood and wine
Eke Palamon with full greet company
And aftir that came woeful Emelye
With fire in hond as was that time the gyse
To do the office and the funeral seruise
High labor and full greet apparelynge
Was at the seruise of that fire making
That with his grene top the heaven raughte
And twenty fadom of bread the armies straugh^e
This is to say the bows were so brood
Of straw first was laid meny a lood
But how the fire was made up an heyghte
And as to tell you what the treys highte
As ok fur birch / ash / alder holm popeler
Mapil thorn / bech / aspe / box chesteyn lynd / laurer
Wilow / elm / plane hasil and whipul^re
How they were fellid shall not be told for me
Ne how the goddis rennyn up a (...) down
Disherited of their habitacion^
In which they woned in rest and pees
Nymphs faunus and arnarides
Ne how the bestis and the briddes all
Fillen for feer when the wode began fall
Ne how the ground aghast was of the light
That was not wont to se the son bright
Ne how the fire was cowchid first with stre
And than with dry stickys cloven on three
And than with grene wode and spicery
And than with cloth of gold made with perry
And garlondis hanging with many a flour
The mirre the encence with sweet odor
Ne how arcite lay among all this
Ne what richesse abowte his body is
Ne how that Emelye as was the gyse
Put in the fire for funeral seruise
Ne how she swowned when made was the fire
Ne what she spak ne what was her desire
Ne what iewellis men in to the fire cast
When that the fire was great and brende fast
Ne how some cast her shield and some her spear
And of her vestimentis which that they were
And cuppis full of mylk wine and blood
In to the fire that brent as it were wood
Ne how the grekis with an huge route
Thries riden all the fire about
Op on the lift hond with an high showtynge
And thries with here speris clateringe
And thries how the ladies began cry
Ne how that led was homward Emelye
Ne how arcite is brent to asshen cold
Ne how the lich wakis were y hold
That ilke night ne how the grekis pleye
The wake pleyes keep I not to seye
which wrastelith best naked with oil anointed
Ne who that bare him best at the point
I will not tell al how they goon
Hom to attenes when the pley is done
B^t shortly to the point than wol I w^nde
To make of my long tale an end
BE process and be length of certain yeris
Al stynt is the morning and the cheris
Of grekis be on general assent
Than semyth me there was a parliament
At actenes upon certain point and caas
And among the which poyntis spokyn was
To have with certain contrees aliaunce
And have fully of Thebes obeissaunce
For which this nobil Theseus anon
Leet send aftir gentyl Palamon
Vnwist of him what was the cause and why
But in his blake clothis sorowfully
He came at his commandment an hye
Tho sent Theseus for Emelye
When they were set and pres was all the place
And Theseus abiden has a space
Or any word came from his wise breast
His yen be cast there as him list
And with a sad visage he sighed stille
And aftir that right thus he said his will
The first mouer of the cause above
When he first made the cheyne of love
Greet was the effect and high was the intent
Well wiste he why and what there of he meant
For with that fair cheyne of love he bond
The fire the eyr the watir and the land
In certain bondis that may not fle
The same prince and the same mouer quod he
Has stablisshed in this wrecchid world a down
Certain days and duracion
To all that is engendrid in this place
Over the which day they mow not pace
Al mow they the days abrigge
There nedith non auctorite to leg
For it is preued be experience
But that me list to declare my sentence
Than may well men be this order discern
That ilke mouer stabyl is and eterne
Well may men know but it be a fool
That every party darreynyd fro his hool
For nature has not take his beginning
Of one part or of a cantel of a thing
But of a thing that parfyt is and stable
Descendyng so till it be corumpabyl
And therefore for his wise purueaunc^
He has so well be set his ordenaunce
That specifieth of thingis and progressions
Sholden endure be successions
And naught etern^ without any lie
This may thou understand and se at ye
Lo the ook that has so long a norisshynge
Fro the time that he begins to spring
And has so long lif as ye may se
Yet at the last wastid is the tree
Considers how that the hard stoon^
Under our feet / on which we trede and goon^
Yet wastith it as it lith be the wey
The brood river sumtyme wexith drey
The great towns se we wane and wend
Than ye se that al thing has an end
Of man of womman se we also
That nedith in one of the termys two
This is to say in yongthe or ellis in age
He moot be ded the king as shall a page
Some in his bed some in the deep see
Some in the large feld as ye may se
There helpith naught. all gone that ilke weye
Than may I say al thing mot needs deye
What makith this but Iubiter the king
That is prince and cause of al thing
Converting us all unto his propre will
For which it is darreyned soth to tell
And for agayns it no creature a live
Of no degree avails forto stryus
Than is it wisdom as thinks me
To make virtue of necessite
And take it whilis we may not it eschew
And thinks that to us all it is due
And who so grucchith he does folly
And rebel is to him that al may gye
And certainly a man has most honor
To dien in his most excellent flour
When he is sikir of his good name
Than has he do his friend no harm ne shame
And gladder may his friend be of his death
When with honor so up yolden is his breath
Than when his name appallid is for age
For all foryeten is than his vasselage
Than is hit best as for a worthy fame
To dien when he is best of name
The contrary eke for all his wilfulness
Why grucche we why have we heaviness
That good arcite of cheualrie the flour
Departed is with duete and honor
Out of the foul prison of this lif
Why grucchid his cosyn and his wif
Of his welfare that loves him so weel
Can he hem thank nay god woot never a deel
That both his soul and eke him offend
And yet they mow her lustis not amend
What shall I conclude of this long story
But aftir woe I read us be merry
And thonke Jupiter of al his grace
And er we departen from this place
I read we make of sowwis two
O parfit joy lastyng ever mo
And looks now where most sorrow is ynne
There will I first amend and begin
Sustir quod he this is my full assent
With all the auyse of my parliament
That gentyl Palamon your owen knight
That serves you with heart and might
And ever has do syn ye first him knew
That ye shul of your grace on him rewe
And take him for husbond and lord
Lene me your hond for this is our accord
Let se now of your wommanly pity
He is a kyngis sons brother parde
And though he were a pour bacheler
Syn he has served you so meny a year
And had for you so great aduersite
It mot be considered leuyth me
For gentyl mercy ought to pass right
Than said he thus to Palamon the knight
I trow there nedith lityl sermonynge
To make you assent to this thing
Comes hithir and takith your lady be the bond
And thus of hem both was made the bond
That highte matrimony or marriage
Be all the counsel of the Baronage
And thus with all blis and melodye
Has Palamon wedded Emelye
And god that all this world has wrought
Sent him his love that he dear had bought
For now is Palamon in all well
Living in blis in riches and in hele
And Emely him loves so tenderly
And he here seruith so gentilly
That there was no word hem between
Of jealousy or of any other tene
Thus endith Palamon and Emelye
And god save all this company
Here endith the knyghtis tale. And begins the Milleris prolog.
When that the knight had thus his tale told
In all the company nas there young ne old
That he ne said it was a nobyl story
And worthy to be draw in memory
And namely the gentilis euerichon
Our host lowgh and sw^or so mot I goon
Thus vnbokelid well is the male
Let se now who shall tell another tale
For trewly the game is well begone
Now tell ye sir monk if that ye konne
Some what to quyte with the knight his tale
The Milward that for dronkyn was al pale
So that vnnethis up on is horse he sat
He nolde auale another hood ne hat
Ne abide noman for his curtesye
But in Pilatis vois he began cry
And swoor be armies blood and bonys
I can an nobil tale forth nonys
The which I wol now quyte the knight his tale
Our ost saw that he was drunk of ale
And said abide robyn leave brothir
Sum bettir man shall tell first anothir
Abide let us work thriftely
Be cokkis soul quod he that nyl not I
For I will speak or ellis go my wey
Our host answered tell on a devil wey
Thou art a fool thy wit is overcome
Now herkeneth quod the myllere all and some
But first I make a protestacion^
That I am drunk I know be my soun
And therefore if I aught mys speak or say
Wite it the ale of Suthwerk I you pray
For I wol tell a legende and a life
Both of a Carpenter and of his wif
How that the clerk has set the wrightis cappe
The reave answered and said stynt thy clappe
Let be thy lewd dronkyn harlottrye
Hit is sin and eke greet folly
To appeire any man or him defame
And eke bring wyuys in such a name
Thou may I nowgh of other thyngis sayn
This dronkyn Milward spak full sone again
And said leave brothir Oswold
Who has no wife he is no cokeold
But I (...) not therefore that thou art on
There bith good wyuys many on
Why art thou angri with my tale now
I have a wife parde as well as thou
Yet nolde I not for the oxen in my plow
Take up on me more than ynow
And deem of my self that I were one
I wol believe that I am none
An husbond should not be inquisityf
Of goddis priuitees ne of his wife
So he may find goddis fuson there
Of the remenaunt nedith not to enquere
What should I more say but this Millere
He nolde his word for noman forbere
But told his chorlis tale in his manner
Me over thinks that I shall reherce it here
And therefore every gentyl wight I pray
Demeth not for goddis love that I say
Not for evil intent but that I most reherce
Here talis al be they better or werce
Or ellis falsen some of my matere
And therefore who so listith not to here
Turn over the leef and chees another tale
For he shall find ynowe both great and small
Of historial thing that towchith gentilnesse
And eke moralite and holiness
Blames not me if that ye chese amys
The Myllere is a chorle ye know well this
So is the reave and eke other mo
And harlottrye they told both two
Auysith you and put me out of blame
And eke men shul not make ernest of game
Here begins the Milleres tale.
WHilom therwas dwelling in Oxenforde
A rich chuf that gestis had to ^orde
And of his craft he was a Carpenter
With him there was dwellinge a pour scoler
Had lernyd art but al his fantasye
Was turnyd for to learn astrologye
And could a certain of conclusions
To demyn by interrogacions
If that men axed him certain hours
Whether they should have drought or shoures
Or if that men axed him what should befalle
Of every thing I may not rekene all
This clerk was clepid hende Nicholas
Of dern^ love he could and of solas
And thereto he was sly and full pryue
And lyk amayden meke forto se
A chambir had he in that hostelrye
Alone without any company
Full fetously I dight with herbis sote
And he him self was sweet as is the rote
Of licorice or of any Cetewale
His almegeste his bokis great and small
His astrologye. longinge for his art
His awgrym stones lay feire a part
On sheluis cowchid at his beddis head
His press ycouered with a foldyng reed
And al above there lay agay saw^re
On which he made a nyghtis melodye
So sweet that all the chambir rong
And Angelus ad virginem he song
And aftir that he song the kyngis note
Full often blissid was his merry throat
And thus this sweet clerk his time spent
Aftir his sendinge and his rent
This Carpenter had weddid a new wife
Which that he louyd more than his life
Of.xxviij. year she was of age
Ielous he was and held her narow in cage
For she was wild and young and he was old
And demed him self lik to be a Cokewolde
He knew not Caton for his wit was rude
That biddith aman wedde his similitude
Men should wedde aftir her astate
For yonthe and old ben often at debate
But s^then he was fallen in the snare
He mus^e endure as other folk his care
As any wesil her body gent was and small
And thereto her kyrtil pynchid with all
A saint she weride y barrid al of silk
A barmecloth as white as morrow mylk
Up on her lendis with full meny agore
White was her smok and browdid al before
And eke behind on her coler about
Of coleblac silk withynne and without
The tapettis of her white voluper
Were of the same suit of the coler
Her filet brood of silk and set full hye
And sikirly she had a likerous ye
Full small I pullid were her browis two
And they were bent and blak as any slo
She was more blisful on to se
Th^n is the new pere genet tree
And softer than is the wulle of a weder
And by her girdyl hangith a purs of leder
Tarselid with grene and perlid with laton
In all this world to seek up and down
There is noman so wise that could thenche
So gay a pupelot or so praty a wenche
Full brighter was she shynynge of her hue
Than in the tour the nobyl forgid new
But of her song she was as loud and yern
As any swalow sittynge on the bern
Thereto she could skippe and make game
As any kid or calf following his dame
Her mouth was sweet as braket or methe
Or hord of appelis leyd on hey or heth
Wynsynge she was as is a ioly colt
Long as a mast and upright as a bolt
A broche she baar up on her low coler
As brood as is the boos of a bokeler
Here shoon were laced on her leggis hye
She was a prymerolle a piggis nigh
For any lord to liggen in his bed
Or yet for any good yeman to wed
Now sire and eft sire so be fyl the caas
That on a day this hend Nicholas
Fill with this young wife to rage and to pleye
Whylis that her husbond was at Oseneye
As clerkis be full subtle and full queynt
And pryuely he caughte her be the queynt
And said y wis but if I have my will
For dern love of the lemman I spylle
And ^^ld here hard be the shank bones
And said lemman love me at onys
Or I wol dye al so god me save
And she sprung as a colt does in the traue
And with her head she wrieth fast away
She said I wol not kiss the be my fay
Why let be quod she let be Nicholas
Or I will cry out and allas
So wey your hondis for your courtesy
This Nicholas began mercy forto cry
And spak so fair and profred her so fast
That she her love granted him at the last
And swear her oath be saint Thomas of kent
That she would be at his commandment
When that she may her leyser well espy
Mine husbond is so full of ielosye
But ye be waar well and be pryue
I wot right well I am but ded quod she
Ye must be full dern as in this caas
Nay there of care I not quod Nicholas
A clerk had lowdly beset his while
But if he could a carpenter begyle
And thus they ben acorded and y sworn
To wait a time as I have told beforn
When Nicholas had do thus euerideel
And thackyd here about the lendis well
He kiste her sweet and took his sawtrye
And pleyde fast and made melodye
Than fill it thus that to the parish church
Cristis owen workis forto werche
This good wife went on an holyday
Her forhed shoon as brighte as any day
So was it wasshe when she leet her werk
Now was there of that church a parish clerk
The which was y clepyd absolon
Crulled was his here and as the gold it shoon
And strowtid as a fane large and brood
Full straight and euene lay his ioly shode
His rode was reed his yen gray as goos
With powlis wyndowes coruen in his shoos
In hosis reed he went full fetously
I clad he was full small and fetously
In a kirtyl or a lityl waget
Full fair and well be the poyntis set
And there upon he had agay surplis
As white as blossom on the rys
Amery child he was so god me save
Well could he let blood and ek shave
And make a chartir of land and aquytance
In twenty manners could he tryppe and dance
Aftir the scole of Oxenforde tho
And with his hondis cast to and fro
And pleye songis on a small ribible
Thereto he song sometime a loud quynybill
And well cowde he play on his geterne
In all the town nas brewe house ne tavern
That he ne visited it with his solace
There as any gaylard tapster was
But soth to say he was somdel skweymous
Of fartyng and of speech dangerous
This Absolon that ioly was and gay
Goth with a senser on the holy day
S^^singe wyuys of the parish fast
And m^^y a lovely look on hem he cast
And namely on this Carpentires wife
To look on her ^ym toughte a merry life
She was so propir sweet and eek likerous
I dar well say if she had be a mows
And ^e a cat he would her hen^e ^non
This parish clerk this ioly absolon
Has in his heart such a love longing
That of no wife took he n^n offrynge
For curtesye he sa^^e ^e would non
The moon when it was night bright shoon
And Absolon his g^terne had I take
For paramours he thought forto wake
And forth he goth iolif and amerous
Till he came to the Carpenters house
A litil aftir cock^s had I crow
And dressed him up be the shot wyndowe
That was upon the Carpenters wall
He syngith in his wis gentil and small
Now dear lady. if thy will be
I pray you that ye will think on me
Full well according to his giternyng
This Carpenter herd him sing
And spak unto his wife and said anon
What alison he rist thou not absolon
That chauntith thus under our bowri^ wall
And she answerde her husbond there with all
Yes god woot John I here it ^^eridel
This passes forth what will ye bet than well
From day to day this ioly absolon
So woweth her that he is woe begoon
He wakith all the night and all the day
He kembith his lockis broad and makith him gay
He woweth her be menes of brocage
And swoor he would be her owen page
He syngeth brokyng as anyghtyngale
He sent aftir pyment methe and spiced ale
And wafris pypynge hoot out of the glede
And for she was of town he profrid her mede
For some folk wol love wommen for richesse
And some for s^rokis and some for iolynesse
Some time he shows his lus^^^esse: maistrie
He pleyeth he redes up on a staffolt hye
But what avails him as in this caas
She loved so this lend Nicholas
That absolon may blow the buckis ^orn
He ne had for his labor but a scorn
And thus she makith absolon her ape
And al his ernest turns in to a Iape
Full soth is this proverb it is no lie
Men say alwey the night is slye
Makes oftymes leef for to be loath
For though that absolon were wood or wroth
Be cause that he fer was from her sight
This night Nicholas stood in his light
Now bear the well now hend Nicholas
For Absolon may wayle and sing alas
And so befil that on a satirday
This Carpenter was gone til Osenay
And eke hende Nicholas and alison
Acordid be fully to this conclusion
That Nicholas shall shapen him a wyle
This sely ielous husbond to begyle
And if so be the game went a right
She should sleep in his armies al night
For this was her desire and his also
And right anon with out wordis mo
This Nicholas no longer would tarry
But doith full soft in to his chambir carye
Both mete and drink for a day or tweye
And to her husbond bad her forto sey
If that he a^ed aftir Nicholas
She should say she nyste where he was
Of all that day she saw him not with ye
She troweth that he is in some maladye
For that no cry her maid might him call
He nolde answer for no thing might fall
This passith forth all that satirday
That Nicholas stille in his chambir lay
And eet or sleep or deed what him list
Till sunday that the son goth to rest
This sely Carpenter has great meruayl
Of Nicholas or what him might ayl
And said I am adoute be seint Thomas
It stondith not aright with Nicholas
Got shilde that he deyde suddenly
This world is now full tikyl sikirly
I saw a corpse to day bore to church
That now amonday last I say him wirche
Go up quod he unto his knave anon
Clepe at the door or knock with a ston
Look how it is and tell me boldly
This knave goth him up full sturdely
And at the chambir door whil that he stod
He cryde and knokked as he were wood
What how what do you Maistir Nicholay
How may ye slepen all the long day
But al for naught he herd not a word
An hool full low he fond up on a board
There as the cat was wont in forto crepe
And at the hole he looked in full deep
Till at the last he had of him a sight
This Nicholas lay gapyng euyr upright
As he had looked on the new moan
Adoun he goth and tellith his master sone
In what array he saw this ilke man
This Carpenter to bliss him began
And said help us saint frid^swyde
Aman woot litil what him shall betyde
This man is fallen with his astronomye
In some woodnesse or in sum agonye
I thought ay well how it should be
Men should not know of goddis pryuyte
I blissed be alwey alewd man
That naught but only his believe can
So ^^rd anothir clerk with astronomye
He walked in the ^^ldis forto prye
Upon the ^r^r^ys what there should be fall
Till (...) was in a ^arlepit y fall
He saw not that but yet be saint Thomas
Me rewith sore of hend Nicholas
He shall be ^a^yd of his studyyng
If that I may be Ihesu ^^uyn king
Get me a staf that I may vnderspore
While that thou robyn heuyst of the door
He shall out of this studyyng as I guess
And to the chamb^^ door he began him dress
His knave was a strong chorle for the nonys
And by the h^sp he haf it up at onys
Into the floor the door fyl anon
This Nicholas sat as stille as any ston
And euye gaped upward in the eyr
This Carpenter wend that he had be in despeyr
And hente him be the sholdris mightily
And shook him herd and c^yde spetously
What Nicholay what how look adoun
Awake and thynk on cristis passion
I crouche the fro eluys and fro wightis
Therewith the nyghtspel said he anon rightis
On four haluys on the house about
And on the thresshold and on the door without
Ihesu crist and saint Benedight
Bliss this house from every wicked wight
For nyghtis werry the wight pater noster
Where wonnest thou saint Petris suster
And at the last this hend Nicholas
Began for to sighe sore and said alas
Shall all the world be lost eftsoon now
This carpenter answered what says thou now
What thynk on god as we do men that swynke
This Nicholas answerde fecte me drink
And aftir will y speak in to the priuyte
Of certain thingis that towchen me and the
I will it tell the and non other man certain
This carpenter goth down and comyth again
And brought of mighty ale alarge quart
And when each of hem had drunk his part
This Nicholas his door fast shette
And down the carpenter be him he set
He said John mine ^oost leave and dear
Thou shall up on thy truth swear me l^re
That to no wight thou shall this counsel wrey
For it is cristis counsel that y sey
And if thou tell it man thou art forlore
For this vengeance thou shall have therefore
That if thou wreye me thou shall be wood
Nay cr^st forbede it for his verry blood
Quod tho this sely man I am no blabbe
Ne though I say I am not leef to gabbe
Say what thou will I shall it neuyr tell
To child ne wife be him that harowed hell
Now John quod Nicholas I will not lie
I have found hit in mine astrologye
As I have looked in the moon bright
That now a monday next at quartir night
Shall fall a rayn and that so wild and wood
That half so great was never noes flood
This world he said in less than in an hour
Shall al be dreynt so hidons is the shour
Thus shall mankind drenche and lose her lif
This Carpenter answered allas my wife
And shall she drenche alas my alisoun
For sorrow of this he fyl almust adoun
And said is there no remedy in this caas
Yes forgod quod hend Nicholas
If thou will work aftir lore and read
Thou may not work aftir thyn owen head
For this says Salamon that was full true
Work al be counsel and thou shall not rewe
And if thou work wilt be good counsel
I vndirtake without mast or sail
Yet shall I save here and the and me
Have thou not herd how saved was Noe
When that our lord had warned him beforn
That all the world with water should be lorn
Yes quod this carpenter full yore ago
Have thou not herd quod Nicholas also
The sorrow of Noe with his feleship
Or that he might get his wife to ship
Him had lever I dar well undertake
At that time than all his wetheris blake
That she had had a ship her self alone
And therefore wotist thou what is best to done
This askith haste and of an hasti thing
May men not preche ne make taryyng
Anon go get us fast in to this in
A knedynd trowgh or ellis a kemelyn
For each of us but look that they be large
In which we mow swymmen as in a barge
And have therynne vitayl sufficiaunt
But for o day fie on the remenaunt
The water shall a slake and go away
About pryme up on the next day
But robyn may not wite of this thy knave
Ne eke thy maiden gille I may not save
Axe not why for though thou ask me
I will not tell goddis pryuyte
It suffisith the but if thy wit be mad
To have as great a grace as Noe had
Thy wife shall I well save out of doubt
Go now thy wey and speed the here about
But when thou have for the and her and me
Y gotten these knedyng tubbis three
Than shall thou honge hem in the roof full hye
That noman of our pryuyte aspye
And when thou thus have don as I have said
And have our vitayl fair in hem y leyd
And eke and axe to smite the cord a two
When that the watir comes that we may go
And break an hool an high upon the gabyl
Into the gardeyn ward over the stabyl
That we may freely pass forth our way
When that the great shour is passid away
Than shul we swymme as merrily I undertake
As does the white doke aftir the drake
Than will I clepe how alison how John
Be merry for the flood will pass anon
And thou wilt say hayl master Nicholay
Good morrow I se the well for it is day
And than shall we ^e lordis al our lif
Of all the world as Noe and his wife
But of o thing I warn the full right
Be well auisyd on that ilke night
When we be entered into the ship board
That none of us speak no word
Ne clepe ne cry but be in his prayere
For it is goddis owen hest dear
Thy wife and thou must hang fer a twyn
For that betwix you shall be no sin
No More in lokynge than there shall in deed
This ordenaunce is do O god the speed
To morrow at night when folk be all a sleep
Into our knedyng tubbis will we crepe
And sittyn there abydyng goddis grace
Go now thy wey and have ne longer space
To make of this no longer sermonyng
Men sey thus send the wise and say no thing
Thou art so wise it nedith the not to teache
God save our lif and I the beseech
This sely Carpenter goth forth his weye
And to noman would he hit bewreye
But to his wife he told this priuyte
And she was waar and knew it bet than he
What all this queynte cast was for to seye
But natheles she ferde as she would deye
And said alas go forth thy wey anon
Help us to escape or we be ded ^chone
I am thy true weddid wife
Go dear spouse and help to save our life
Lo which a great thing is affection
Men may dye al day of ymaginacion
So deep may impression be take
This sely Carpenter begins ^o quake
Him thinks verily that he may se
Noes flood come walowyng as the se
To drenchen alison his honey dear
He wepith waylith and makes sorry chere
He sighed with many a sorry swongh
He goth and getith him a knedyng trough
And aftir that a tub and a kemelyn
And pryuely he sent hem to his in
And br^ng hem in the roof in pryuyte
With his owen hond he made laddres three
To clymben be the rengis and the stalkis
Into the tubbis hangyng in the balkis
And hem vitaylith both trough and tub
With breed and chese and good ale in a Iub
Suffising right I now as for o day
But or that he had maad all that array
He sent his knave and eke his wenche also
Op on his erond to london forto goo
And on the sunday when it drew to night
He shitte his door without candel light
And dressid al thing as it should be
And shortly up they clomben all three
They sittyn stille well a furlong way
Now pater noster clum said Nicholaye
And clum said John and clum said alison
This Carpenter said his devotion
And stylle he sittith and biddith his praiere
Awaytyng on the rayn if he it here
The ded sleep for very werynesse
Fyl on this Carpenter right as I guess
About curfu time or litil more
For traueyl of his ghost he gronyth sore
And eft he rowtith for his head mys lay
Down of the ladder stalkith Nicholay
And alison full soft down she spedde
Without wordis mo they go to bed
Each began other in arms plye
There was the revel and the melodye
And thus lies alison and Nicholas
In besines of myrthe and solas
Till that the belle of lauds began to ring
And freris in the chauncel began to sing
This parish clerk this absoson
That is for love alwey so woe be gone
Up on the monday was at Oseney
With a company him to disport and pley
And askid upon a caas a cloisterer
Full pryuely aftir John the Carpenter
And he drew him apart out of the church
And said I not I saw him here not wirche
Since satirday I trow that he be went
For tymbir that our abbot has him sent
For he is wont for tymbir for to go
And dwell at the graunge a day or two
Or ellis he is at his house certain
Where that he be I can not sothly sayn
This absolon full ioly was and light
And thought now is time to wake alnyght
For sikirly y saw him not steryng
About his door syn day began to spring
So moot y thryue y shall or cockis crow
Pryuely knocken at his wyndow
That stont full low up on his bowris wall
To alison now wol I tellen al
My love longinge for yet I shall not mys
That at the least wey I shall her kys
Some manner comfort shall I have perfay
My mouth has icched all this long day
That is a sign of kissinge at the least
Al night y mecte eke that I was at a feste
Therefore y will go sleep an hour or tweye
And all the night than will I walk and pleye
When that the first cok has crow anon
Up risith this ioly lover absolon
And him arayeth gay at point deuyse
But first he shewith grayn and licoryse
To smellen sweet or he had kempt his here
Under his tongue a true love he beer
For thereby wend he to have be gracious
He comes to the Carpenteres house
And stille he stont under the shot wyndow
Unto his breast it raught it was so low
And soft he knocks with a semysoun
What do ye honycombe sweet alson
My feyre bird my swe^e synamome
Awaketh lemman com and speak tome
Full lityl think ye up on my woo
That for your love y sweet there I goo
No wonder is though I swelte and sweet
I morn as does a lamb aftir the tete
I wys lemman y have such love longing
That lik a turtil true is my morning
I may not ete no more than amayde
Go fro the wyndow Jack fool she said
As help me god it wol not be combame
I love another and ellis y were to blame
Well bet than the be Ihesu absolon
Go forth thy wey or I wol throw a stoon
And let me sleep a twenty devil wey
Allas quod absolon and well awey
That true love was euyr euel be set
Than kis me syn it may be no bet
For Ihesus love and for the love of me
Will thou than go thy wey there with quoth she
Ye certis lemman quod this absolon
Than make the ready quod she I come anon
And unto Nicholas she said stille
Now pees and thou shall lawghe al thy fille
This absolon down set him on his knees
And said y am a lord at al degrees
For aftir this y hope there comyth more
Lemman thy grace and sweet bryd thyn o^e
The wyndowes she vndoth and that in haste
Have do quod she com of and speed the fast
Lest that our neyghebouris the a spy
This absolon began wype his mouth full dry
Derk was the night as piche or cool
And at the wyndow she put out her hool
And absolon him felt ne bet ne wers
But with his mouth he kissed her ers
Full sauerly or he were war of this
Abac he stert and thought it was amys
For well wyste he a womman had no berd
He felt a thing al row and long herid
And said fie alas what have y do
Tehe quod she and clappid the wyndow to
And Absolon goth forth a sorry paas
A berd a berd quod hend Nicholas
By goddis corpus this goth fair and weel
This sely absolon herd every deel
And on his lip he began for angir byte
And to him self he said I shall the quyte
Who rubbith now who frotith now his lippis
With dust with cloth with sond with chippis
But Absolon that says full often alas
My soul betake I said he to sathanas
But me were leuyr than all this town quod he
On this despit wrokyn forto be
Alas quod he alas that I ne had blent
His hoot love was cold and al queynt
For fro that time that he had kissed her ars
Of paramours set he not a cars
For he was helid of his maladye
Full often paramours began he diffye
And wept as does a child that is beat
A soft paas he went him over the street
Unto a smyth men called dane Gerueys
That in his forge smytith plow harneys
He sharpith the share and the cultre bisely
This Abselon knockith al esely
Of all this pley again no word he yaf
He had more towh on his distaf
Than geruais knew and said friend so dear
That hoot cultre in the chynmey here
As lene it me I have therewith to doon^
And I wol bring it the again full sone
Geruais answered. certis were it gold
Or in a poke noblis al untold
Thou sholdest it have as I am true smyth
Ey cristis foot what will ye do there with
Therefore quod absolon be as be may
I shall well tell it the to morrow or day
And caughte the cultre be the cold steel
Full soft out of the door he began stele
And went unto the Carpenteris wall
He cowghed first and knokked therewith al
Up on the wyndow. right as he did eer
This alison answered who is there
That knockith so y warant it a thef
Why nay quod he god woot my sweet lef
I am absolon thy own derlinge
Of gold quod he I have the brought a ryng
My mother yaf it me so god me save
Full fyn it is and thereto well I grave
This wol y give the if thou me kiss
This Nicholas was risen forto pysse
And thought he would amend all the iape
He should kiss his ers or that he escape
And up the wyndow deed he hastily
And out his ars he puttith pryuely
Over the buttok to the shank boon
And therewith spak this clerk Absolon
Spek sweet brid I not where thou art
This Nicholas anon let fle a fart
As great as it had be a thonder dent
That with the struck he was almost y blent
And he was ready with his yren hoot
And Nicholas amyd the ers he smoot
Of goth the skyn an hond bread abowte
The hoote cultre brende so his towte
And for the smert he wend forto dye
As he were wood for woe he began cry
Help water water help for goddis heart
This Carpenter out of his slombir stert
And herd one cry water as he were wood
And thought allas now comyth the flood
He set him up without wordis mo
And with his axe he smoot the cord a two
And down goth al he fond neither to selle
Ne breed ne ale till he com to the selle
Up on the floor and there a swoun he lay
Up stert alisoun and Nicholay
And cryde out and harow in the street
The neyghebours both small and great
In ronnyn forto gawryn on this man
That yet a swoun lay both pale and wan
For with the fall broste has he his arm
But stand he most unto his owen harm
For when he spak he was anon bore down
With hende Nicholas and alisoun
They told every man that he was wood
So he was aghast of Noes flood
Through fantesye that of his vanite
He had bought him knedyng tubbis three
And had hem hanged in the roof above
And that he prayde hem for goddis love
To sittyn in the roof per company
The folk began lawgben at his fantesye
In to the roof they kykyn and they gape
And turned al his harm in to a iape
For what so ever this carpenter answered
It was for naught noman his reason herd
With othis great he was swore adoun
That he was hold wood in all the town
For every clerk right anon held with other
They said the man was wood my leave brother
And every wight began lawghe at this scrif
Thus swyuyd was the carpenteris wife
For all his keeping and al his Ielosye
And absolon has kissed her nethir ye
And Nicholas is scalded in the toute
This tale is done and god save all the route
Here ends the Milleres ta^. And here begins the reues prolog.
WAn folk had lawghyn at this nyce caas
Of absolon and of hende Nicholas
Diverse folk diversely they sayden
But for the more part they laughte and pleyden
Ne at this tale y saw noman him grieve
But if it were only Oswold the reave
Be cause he was of Carpenteris craft
A litil ire is in his heart y laft
He began to grucche and blame it a lyte
Si^the quod he full well I could the quyte
With bleryng of a proud Mylleres ye
If that me list to speak of Rebaudrye
But y am old me list not to pleye for age
Gras time is done my foder is forage
This white top writith my old yeris
Mine heart also moulid is as mine here is
But if I fare as does an open ers
That ilke fruit is ever longer the wers
Till it be rotyn in mullok or in stre
We old men I dread so fare we
Till we be rotyn can we not be ripe
We hopyn alwey while the world wol pype
For in our will there stikith ever a nayl
To have an hoore head and a grene tail
As has a leek for though our might begone
Our will desirith fully ever in one
For when we may naught do than wol we speken
Yet in our cold asshen old fire is rekyn
Four gledis have we which I shall deuyse
Auauntyng lyynge anger and couetyse
These four sparkelis longith unto eld
Our old lymys mow we not beweld
But will shall not fail that is soth
And yet have I alwey a coltis toth
As many a year as it is passed hen
Sen that my tappe of lif began to run
For sikirly when I was born anon
Death drew the tappe of lif and let it gon^
And ever seth has so the tappe run
Till that almost al empty is the tonne
The streme of lif now droppith on the chymbe
The sely tunge may well ring and chymbe
Of wrecchidnesse that past is full yore
With old folk save dotage there is no more
When that our host had herd this sermonyng
He began to speken as lordly as a king
And said what amountith all this wit
What shul we speak alday of holy writ
The deuel made a reave forto preche
Or of a sowter a shipman or a leche
Say forth thy tale and tarry not the time
Lo depford it is halfwey to pryme
Lo grenewich that many a shrewe is ynne
It were al time thy tale forto begin
Now sires quod Oswold the reave
I pray you all that ye you not grieve
Though that y answer and somdel set his houn
For leful is with force forto sown
This dronkyn myllere has told us here
How that begilid was a master carpentere
Parauenture in scorn^ for that I am one
And be your leave I shall him quyte anon
Right in his chorlis termys w^l I speak
I pray to god his neck mow to break
He can well in mine ye se a stalk
But in his owen he can not se a balk
Here ends the reuys prolog. And here begins his tale.
AT trompynton not fer fro Cambrige
There goth a brook and over that a brige
Up on the which brook there stondith a mylle
And this is verry soth that I you tell
A myller was there dwelling many a day
As any pecok he was proud and gay
Pipe he could and fisshe and nettis beat
And turn cuppis and well wrastil and lepe
And by his belt he baar a long pauade
And of a sw^rd full trenchant was the ^la^d
A ^oly popper baar he in his pouche
There was noman for peril durst him touch
A sheffeld thwytel bare he in his hose
Round was his face and camoysid was his nose
Also pilled as an ape was his skulle
He was a market beter at the fulle
There durst no wight hond up on him leg
That he ne swoor anon he should abegge
A thef he was for sothe of corn and mele
And that a sligh and vsant forto stele
His name whas I hot deynus Symkyn
A wife he had come of nobyl kyn
The person of the town her fader was
With here he yaf many a pan of bras
For that Symkyn should in his blood alye
She was fostrid in a Nonnerye
For Symkyn would no wise as he said
B^t if she were well y norisshid and amayde
To save his astat of yemanrye
And she was proud and pert as a pie
A full feir sight was up on hem two
An holiday beforn her would he go
With his tipet ybounde about his head
And she came aftir in a gite of reed
And Symkyn had hosen of the same
There durst no wight clepe her but dame
Was non so hardy that went be the way
That with her durst onys rage or play
But if he would be slain of Symkyn
With pauade or with knyf or bodekyn
For ielous folk ben parlous euermo
Algatis they would her wyuys wenten so
And eke also for she was somdele smotirlich
She was as dyne as watir in a dich
And full of ho^our as a pismare
Here thought a lady should her spare
What for her kynrede and her nortilrye
That she had lernyd in the Nonerye
A doughtir had they betwix hem two
Of twenty year without any mo
Saving a child that was of half year age
In cradyl it lay and was a proper page
This wenche thick and well I grow was
With Camoys nose and yen gray as glass
Buttokkis broad and brestis round and hye
But right fair was her here I will not lie
The parson of the town for she was feyr
In purpos was to make her his heyr
Both of his catell and of his mesuage
And strange he made it of her marriage
His purpos was to bestow here hye
Unto sum worthy blood of auncetrye
For holy church gods must be spendid
On holy church blood that is descendid
Therf^re he would his holy blood honor
Though that holy church should devour
Great sokyn had this myller out of doubt
With whete and malt of all the land about
And namely there was a great Colege
Men clepith it the soler halle of Cambregge
There was her whete and ek her malt I ground
And on a day it happed in a stounde
Seek lay the Mauncipyl on amalady
Men wenden wisly that he should die
Fro whom this Myllers stale both whete and corn
An hundrid time more than he did beforn
For there before he stal but curteisly
But now he was a thief full outrageously
For which the wardeyn chidde and made fare
But thereof set this Myllere not a tare
He crakid bost and said it was not so
Than were there pore clerkis two
That dueldyn in this halle of which I sey
Testyf they were and lusty forto pley
And only for her myrthe and reuelrye
Up on the wardeyn bisily they cry
To give hem leave but a litil stounde
To go to the mylle and se her corn^ y ground
And hardely they durst ley her neck
The myllere should not stele half a pecke
Of corn be sleyghte or by force hem tene
And at the last the wardeyn yaf hem leave
John highte that on and aleyn highte that other
Of a town were they born that highte strodir
Fer in the north I can not tell where
They makyn ready al her owen gere
And on her horse the sackis cast anon
Forth goth aleyn the clerk and eke John
With good swerd and bokeler by her side
John knew the wey him nedid no gyde
And at the mylle the sak adoun he leith
Aleyn spak first al hayl Symond in feith
How farith thy fair daughter and thy wife
Aleyn welcome quod Symkyn be my life
And John also what how what do ye here
Symond quod he by god need has no pere
Him bus serve him self that has no swayn
Or ellis he is a fool as clerkis sayn
Our mauncipyl I hope he wol be ded
Swa workis ay there wangis in his head
And therefore I is come and this aleyn
To grynde our corn and carry it again
I pray you speed us heyn in that ye may
It shall be do quod Sy^kyn be my fay
What will ye do whylis it is in hond
Be god right be the hoper wol I stond
Quod John and se how the corn goos in
Yet saw I neuyr be my fadir kyn
How the hoper waggis to and fro
Ale^n answered ^ohn wolt thou so
Than wol y be benethe by my croun
And se hon the mele fall is adoun
In to the trowgh that shall be my disport
For John in faith I may be of your sort
Ay is as ^lle a Myllere as is ye
This myller smyled of her nyce^e
And thought all this is don but for awyle
They wene that noman may hem begyle
But be my thrifte yet shall I blere her ye
For all her sleyghte and her philosophye
The more queynte crekis that they make
The more shall I stele when I take
Instead of flour yet will I give hem bren
The grettist clerkis be not wisest men
As whilom the wolf spak to the mare
Of al her art ne count I not atare
Out at the door he goth full pryuely
When that he saw his time softly
He lokith up and down til he has found
Thise clerkis horse where they stood bound
Behind the mylle under a l^effeel
And to the horse he goth fair and well
He stripith of the beidyl right anon
And when the horse were loos they began gone
Toward the feld where wild maris run
Forth with with wehy through thick and thynne
This myllere goth again no word he seyde
But does his note and with the clerkis pleyde
Til that her corn was feire and well ground
And when the mele is sackid and bound
This John goth forth and fynt his horse aweye
And began to cry harow and well awey
Our horse is lorn aleyn for cokkys banys
Step out on thy feet com thennys at anys
Allas our wardeyn has his palfrey lorn
This aleyn al forgot both mele and corn
Al was out of mind his husbondry
What whilk wey is he gone he began cry
The wife com rennynge ynward at a run
She said allas your horse goth to fenne
With wild maris. as fast as he may go
Vnthank come on his hand that bond hem so
And he that bettir should have knyt the reyne
Allas quod John allas for cristis pain
Ley down thy swerd and I will mine alswa
I is full swifte. god woot as is a raa
Be cockis heart he shall not a escape us bathe
Swa workis ay there wangis in his head
And therefore I is come and this aleyn
To grynde our corn and carry it again
I pray you speed us heyn in that ye may
It shall be do quod Symkyn be my fay
What will ye do whylis it is in hond
Be god right be the hoper wol I stond
Quod John and se how the corn goos in
Yet saw I neuyr be my fadir kyn
How the hoper waggis to and fro
Aleyn answered John wolt thou so
Than wol y be benethe by my croun
And se hon the mele fallis adoun
In to the trowgh that shall be my disport
For John in faith I may be of your sort
Ay is as ille a Myllere as is ye
This myller smyled of her nycete
And thought all this is don but for awyle
They wene that noman may hem begyle
But be my thrifte yet shall I blere her ye
For all her sleyghte and her philosophye
The more queynte crekis that they make
The more shall I stele when I take
Instead of flour yet will I give hem bren
The grettist clerkis be not wisest men
As whilom the wolf spak to the mare
Of al her art ne count I not atare
Out at the door he goth full pryuely
When that he saw his time softly
He lokith up and down til he has found
Thise clerkis horse where they stood bound
Behind the mylle under a leeffeel
And to the horse he goth fair and well

And when the horse were loos they began gone
Toward the feld where wild maris run
Forth with with wehy through thick and thynne
This myllere goth again no word he seyde
But does his note and with the clerkis pl^yde
Til that her corn was feire and well ground
And when the mele is sackid and bound
This John goth forth and fynt his horse aweye
And began to cry harow and well awey
Our horse is lorn aleyn for cokkys banys
Step out on thy feet com thennys at anys
Allas our wardeyn has his palfrey lorn
This aleyn al forgot both mele and corn
Al was out of mind his husbondry
What whilk wey is he gone he began cry
The wife com rennynge ynward at a run
She said allas your horse goth to fenne
With wild maris. as fast as he may go
Vnthank come on his hand that bond hem so
And he that bettir should have knyt the reyne
Allas quod John allas for cristis pain
Ley down thy swerd and I will mine alswa
I is full swifte. god woot as is a raa
Be cockis heart he shall not a escape us bathe
Why ne had thou put the ^^pyl in to the lathe
Ille hayl be god aleyn thou is a fonne
These sely clerkis have well fast y run
Toward the fenne both aleyn and eke John
And when the Myllere saw they were goon
He h^lf a busshel of her corn has take
And ^ad his wife go knede it in a cake
And said I trow the clerkis were a ferd
Yet can a Myllere make a clerkis berd
For all her art yet let hem go her wey
Lo where they goon so lat the children pley
They get hem naught so lightly be my croun
These sely clerkis rennyn up and down
With keep keep stond stond Iossa ware derere
Ga whistle thou there and I shall keep him here
But shortly til it was verily night
They could not though they deed al her might
Her capil cacche he ran alwey so fast
Till in a diche they caughte him at the last
Weary and weet as best is in the rayn
Comyth sely John and wi^h him aleyn
Allas quod John the day that I was born
Now are we driven to hething and to scorn
Our corn is stole men will us folis call
Both the ward^yn and our felowis all
And namely the Myller well a wey
Thus pleyneth John as he goth be the wey
Toward the Mylle and bayard in his hond
The Myller sittyng be the fire he fond
For it was night and ferther might they naught
But for the love of god they him besought
Of herberowh and of ese as for her penny
The myller said again if there be any
Such as hit is yet shulle ye have your part
Mine house is strait but ye have lernyd art
Ye can be argumentis maken a place
A mile brood of twenty foot of space
Let se now if this place wol suffice
Or make it romer with speech as is your gise
Now Symond said thiz John be saint Cutberd
Ay is thou merry and that is well answered
I have herd say the men shall take of two thingis
Swilk as he fyndis or swilk as he bringis
But specially y pray the host so dear
Get us some mete and drink and make us chere
And we wol trewly at the fulle
With empti hondis men may not hawkis culle
Lo here my silver ready forto spend
This myller to the town his daughter send
For ale and breed and rostid hem a goos
And bond her horse that he should no more go loos
And in his owen chamber he made a bed
With shetes and with chalous fair I spread
Not from his owen bed ten foot or twelve
His daughter had a bed al be her selue
Right in the same chambir by and by
It might be no bet the cause why
There was no romer herberow in the place
They soupen and spekyn of sola^e
And dronkyn euyr strong ale at best
About mydnyght went they to rest
Well has this Myller vernysshed his head
Full ^^le he was for drunk and not red
He ye^ith and he spekith tho^ow the nose
A^ ^e were on the quacke or on the pose
To bed he goth and with him goth his wife
As any Iay was she light and iolyf
So was her ioly whistyl well y wet
The cradyl at here beddis side was set
To rocken and to give the child sowke
And when that dawkyn was in the crowke
To bed went the daughter right anon
To bed goth aleyn and also John
Th^r is no more there nedith hem no dwale
This Myller has so wisely bibbed ale
That as an horse he fuortith and sleep
Ne of his tail behind he takith no keep
His wife bare him a burd^n full strong
Men might hem here rowtyng a furlong
The wenche rowted eke par company
Aleyn the clerk that herd this melody
He pokyd John and said slepist thou
Herdist thou euyr slyke a song or now
Lo whilk a complyn is atw^ne hem all
A wild fire on her bodyys fall
Who herd euyr swylk a ferly thing
Ye they shall have the flour of ill endyng
This long night there tyd us no rest
But yet noforce al shall be for the best
For John said aleyn al so mot I thryue
If that I may ye wenche wol I swyue
Some esement has law shapen us
For John there is alawe that says thus
That if aman in o thing be agreued
That in a nothir he shall be releued
Our corn is stole sothly hit is no nay
And we have had an evil fytte to day
And syn I shall have non amendment
Ageyns my loss I wol have esement
Be goddis sale it shall non other be
This John answered aleyn auyse the
The myllere is a perlous man he seyde
And if that he out of his sleep abreyde
He might do us bathe a velony
Aleyn answered I count him not a slye
And up he rist and to the wenche he creep
This wenche lay upright and fast sleep
Til he so ny was or she might aspye
That it had be to late for to cry
And shortly forto tell they were atone
Now play aleyn for I will speak of John
This John lith stille a furlongwey or two
And to him self he made great woo
Allas quod he this is a wicked Iape
Now may I say that I is but an ape
Yet has my fellow somewhat for his harm
He has the Myllars daughter in his arm
He auntrid and his nedis spedde
And I ly as a draf sak in my bed
And when this Iape is told anothir day
I shall be hold a daffe a cokenay
I will a rise and auntre me be my feyth
Vnhardy vnsely thus men seyth
And up he roos and softly he went
Unto the cradyl and in his arm it hent
An bare it soft unto his beddis feet
Sone aftir the wife her rowtyng leet
And began awake and went her out to piss
And came again and began her cradyl mysse
And gropid here and there but she fond non
Allas quod she I had almost mysgon
I had almost goon to the clerkis bed
Do wey benedicite than had I foul sped
And forth she goth til she the cradyl fond
She gropith alwey serther with her hond
And fond the bed^ thought naught but good
Be cause that the Cradyl be it stood
And nyste never where she was for it was derk
But fair and well she crepte unto the clerk
And lith full stille and would have caught a sleep
With ynne a while this John up leep
And on this good wife he leyeth on sore
So merry a fytte had not she full yore
He prykith hard and sore as he were mad
This ioly life have these two clerkis lad
Till that the thridde cok began to sing
Aleyn wext weary in the dawning
For he had swonken all the long night
And said fare well my fair sweet wight
The day is come I may no longer bide
Yet evermore where so y go or ride
I am thyn owen clerk sa have I hele
Now dear lemman quod she go fare well
But or thou go o thing I wol the tell
When that thou wendist homward by the melle
Right at enter of the door behind
Thou shall a cake of half abusshel find
That was maad of thyn owen mele
Which that I halp my fader forto stele
And good lemman god the save and keep
And with that word almost she began to wep^
Aleyn vprist and thought or that it dawe
I will go crepe in be my felawe
And fond the cradil with his hond anon^
Be god thought he al wrong have I gone
My head is toty of my swynk to night
That makith me that y go not a right
I wot well by the cradyl I have mys go
Here lith the myllere and his wife also
And forth he goth a twenty devil way
Into the bed there the myllere lay
He wend have cropen in be his fellow John
And by the myller in he creep anon
And caughte him be the neck and soft spak
He said thou swyneshede awake
For cristis soul and here a nobyl game
For by that lord that called is saint Iame
As I have thryys in this short night
Swyuyd the mylleris daughter bolt upright
Whylis thou have as a coward be agaste
Ye false harlot have thou so have
A falls traitor falls clerk quod he
Thou shall be ded be goddis dignite
Who durst be so bold to do such disperage
To my daughter that is of such lynage
And be the throat bolle he canghte aleyn
And he hente him dispitously again
And on the nose he smot him with his fist
Down ran the blod up on his breast
And in the floor with nose and mouth to broke
They walowyd as piggis do in a poke
And up they goon and down again anon
Till that the Myllere sporned at a stoon
And down he fyl bacward on his wife
That w^ste no thing of this nyce stryf
For she was fall in sleep a litil wight
With John the clerk that wakid has al night
And with the fall out of her sleep she breyd
Help holy cross of bromehem she said
In manus tuas to the lord I call
A wake Symond the feend is on me fall
Mine heart is brokyn I am but ded
There lies on my womb and on my head
Help Symkyn for the false clerkis fight
This John stert up as fast as he might
And graspid be the wallis to and fro
To find astaf and she stert up also
And knew the eftes bet than did this John
And by the wall astaf she took anon
And saw a litil shymerynge of a light
For at an hole in shon the moon light
And by that light she saw hem both two
But sikirly she nyste who was who
And as she saw a whit thing in her ye
An when she began this white thing aspie
She wend the clerk had werid a volupier
And with the staf she drew ay nere and nere
And wend have hit this aleyn at the full
And smoot the myller on the pilid skul
And down he goth and cryde harow I dye
The clerkis beat him well and let him lie
And greyden hem and eek her horse anon
And eke her mele and on her wey they goon
And at mylle door yet he took his cake
Of half a busshel flour well I bake
Thus is the proud myller well I beat
And has lost the gryndynge of the whete
And paid for the soper eueridell
Of aleyn and of John that beet him well
His wife is swyuyd and his doughtir als
Lo such it is a myllere to be falls
And thereto this proverb is said full soth
Him dare not wene well that evil does
A gilour shall ever begyled be
And god that sit in high mageste
Save all this company great and small
Thus have I quyt the Myllere his tale
Here endith the reuys tale. And begins the cokis prolog.
THe cook of london while the reave spak
For joy he toughte he clawid him on the bak
A ha quod he for cristis owen passion
This Myllere has a sharp conclusion
Up on his argument of herbegage
Well said Salamon in his langage
Ne preesse not every man in thy house
For herborwynge be night is perlous
Well ought a man auisid forto be
Whom that he bring in to his pryuite
I prey to god so give me sorrow and care
Syn euyr that I highte hog of ware
Herd I Myllere bet y set a werk
He had a Iape of malice in the derk
But god forbede that we stynten here
And therefore if ye vouchesauf to here
A tale of me that am a pour man
I wol you tell as well as I can
A lityl Iape that fyl in our cite
Our ost answered and said I grant it the
Now tell on rogger look that it be good
For many a pasty have thou let blood
And many a jack of douyr have thou sold
That had be twis hoot and twis cold
Of many a pilgrym have thou cristis ours
For of thy persely yet fare they the wers
Now tell on gentil roger be thy name
But I pray the be not wroth for game
A man may say full soth in game and pley
Thou say soth said roger be my fey
But soth pley quade pley as the flemyng says
And therefore harry bally be thy feyth
Be thou not wroth ar we departen here
Though that my tale be of an hostillere
But natheles I will not tell it yet
But or we depart I wis thou shall be quyt
And therewith al he lowgh and made chere
And said his tale as ye shul aftir here
Here endith the cokis prolog. And begins his tale.
APrentis whilom duelt in our cite
Of craft of vitaillers was he
As gaylard he was as goldsmyth in the shawe
Broun as a bery a proper felawe
With lokkis I kembid full fetously
Dance he could well and iolily
Than he was clepid Perkyn reuelour
He was as full of love and paramour
As is the hyue full of honey sweet
Well was the wenche the with him might sleep
And at every bridale would he sing and hoppe
He louyd bettir the nethir end than the shop
For when there any ridyng was in chepe
Out of the shop thither would he lepe
Till that he had all the sight y seyn
And daunsed well he would not come again
And gadrid him a meyne of his sort
To ho^pe and sing and make such disport
And there they sect steuene forto mete
To pleyyn at the dyse in such a street
For in the town was there no prentyse
That fayrer could cast a peyre of dyse
Than Perkyn could and thereto he was fre
Of his dispense in place of pryuyte
That fond his master well in his chaffare
For of time he fond his box full bare
For shortly a prentis that is a reuelour
That hauntith dyse riot and paramour
His master shall it in his shop abye
Al have he no part of the mynstralsye
For theft and riot they be conuertibyll
Al can he pleye on gitern^ or ribyble
Revel and truth as in a low degree
They be full wroth alday as men may se
This ioly prentis with his master stood
Till he was near out of his prentishod
Al were he styborn both erly and late
And sumtyme led with revel to Newgate
Where he his vnthriftynes sore aboughte
But at last his master him bethoughte
Up on a proverb that says the same word
Well bet is roten appyl out of horde
Then that he roten all the remenaunt
So farith it be a riotous servant
It is full less harm to lat him pas
Than he should all the seruauntis in the plas
Therefore his master yaf him acquietaunce
And had him go with sorou and myschaunce
And thus this ioly prentis had his leave
Now let him riot all the night or leave
And there is no thief withouten look
That helpith him to waste or to sowke
Of that he beybe can or borow may
Anon he sellith his bed and his array
Unto a compiere of his owen sort
That louyth dyse riot and disporte
And had a wife that held for contenaunce
A shop and swyued for her sustenaunce
Here endith the Cokys tale And begins the man of lawis prolog
OVre host saw that by the bright son
The ark of his artificial day had ^onne
The fourth part and half an ^oure and more
And theygh he were not depp^^^ stert in lore
He wiste it was the.xviij. day
Of april that is messanger to may
And saw well that the shadow of every tree
Was in length of the same quantite
That was the body erect that causid it
And therefore be the shadow he took his wit
That phoebus which that shon so clear and bright
Degrees was.xlv. clomben on height
And for that day is in latitude
Hit is ten of the clock ^e began conclude
And suddenly he plight his horse about
Lording^^ (...) he I warn you all the route
The fourth part of this day is goon
Now for the love of god and saint John
Lose no time as ferforth as ye may
Lordingis the time wastith both night and day
And stelith fro us what privily slepynge
And what through negligence in our waking
As does the streme that turned neuyr again
Descendyng fro the mounteyn in to the plain
Well can senek and many a philosophir
Bewaylen time more than gold in cofyr
For los of catell may recovered be
But los of time shendith us quod he
It will not come again withouten dread
No More than wol Malkynes maydenhede
When that she has lost it in her wantownesse
Let us not mowlyn thus ^n Idelnesse
SIre man of law q^ he so have thou blis
Tell us a tale anon as forward is
Ye be submyttyd thorough your fre assent
To stonden in this caas at my Judgment
Acquyte you now of your be heeft
Than have ye do your deuyr at the leeft
Host quod he depar dien Ie assent
To break forward is not mine intent
Beheste his debt and I would fayn
Plese you / and thereto wole I do my pain
For such law as men yeueth another wight
He should him self use it be right
Thus wol our text but natheles certain
I can right now no thrifty tale seyn
That Chauser they he can but lewdly
On metris and on rymynge craftily
Has said hem in such english as he can
Of old time as knows meny a man
And if he has not said hem leave beother
In o book he has said hem in anothir
For he has told of lovers up an down
Mo than Ouyde made of mention
In his Epistelis that been old
What should he tell hem since they be told
In youth he made of Certes of alkyon
And since he has spoken of euerichon
These nobil wyuys and these nobil lovers eek
Who that wol his large volum seek
Clepyd the sayntis lyuys of cupyde
There may he see the large woundis wide
Of lucrece and of babylone tisbe
The swerd of dido for the false Enee
The swerd of philles for here demophon
The playnte of dyanere and of armyon
Of adryane and eke of Isiphyle
The bareyn isle stondyng in ^he se
The dreynt ^andir for his erro
The teris of Eleyne and eke the woo
Of Briseyde and of Ladomea
The cruelte of the queen Medea
The lityl childryn hangyng be the hals
For why Jason that was of love so falls
Epymystra Penelope and alceste
Her wyfhode comendynge with the best
But certeynly no word ne writith he
Of that wicked ensaumpyl of Canace
That loved her owen brothir synfully
Of which cursid stories I say fie
Or ellis of Tirns appolonius
How that the cursid king antiochus
Beraft his daughter of her maydenhede
That is so horrible a tale forto read
When he here threw up on the pament
And therefore he full of auisement
Would never write in none of his sermons
Of such unkind abhomynacions
Ne I wol none reherce if that I may
But of my tale what should I do this day
Me were loath be likned doutles
To myses that men clepe piarydes
Methamorphoseos woot what I mean
But nether theles I recke not a been
They I come aftir him the which has no lak
I speak in prose let him rymes make
And with that word he with a sobir chere
Began his tale as ye shul after here
O Hateful harm condition of pouert
With thrist. cold and hunger so co^foundid
To asken help the shameth in thy heart
If thou non ask with need art thou so woundid
That verry need vnwrappith al thy woundis hid
Magre thyn head thou must of indigence
Or stele or beg or borow thyn dispense
Thou blamyst crist and say full bitterly
He mys departiht riches temperal
Thyn neyghebour thou witist synfully
And say thou have to lite and he has al
Parfay say thou one day he reken shall
When that his tail shall brenne in the gl^de
For he not helpith the nedful in her n^de
Herkenyth what is the sentence of the wise
Bet is to dyen than to have indigence
Thy self neighbor wol the despise
If thou be pour farewell thy reverence
Yet of the wiseman take his sentence
Althey that pour men be wikk
Bewaar or thou come to the prik
If thou be pour thy brother hatith the
And all thy frendis fle fro the allas
O rich marchauntis full of well ye be
O nobyl and prudent folk as in this caas
Your baggis bith not fillyd with ^mbes aas
But with sys synk that rennyth in your chaunc^
At Cristemasse merry mow ye dance
Ye s^kyn land and se for your wynnyngis
And as wise folk ye know all the state
Of reygnes that been fadir of tidingis
And talis both of pees and of debaat
I were right now of a tale desolaat
Ne were that a Marchan^t gone is many a year
Me taught a tale which ye mow here
IN Surry whylom duellyd a company
Of Chapmen rich thereto sad and true
That wide where senten their spicerye
Clothis of gold and satyn rich of hew
Her chaffare was so trusty and so new
That every wight has deynte of her chaffare
And eke with hem to selle here ware
Now fyl it that the maistris of the sort
Have shapen hem to rome forto wend
Were it for chapman hood or for disport
Non other message would they thither send
But came hem self to rome this is the end
And in such place as thought hem auantage
For her intent they takyn her herbygage
Soiourned have these marchantis in that town
A certain time as syl for her plesaunce
But so be fyl that the excellent renoun
Of the Emperors daughter dame Constan^e
Reported was with every circumstaunce
Unto these marchantis in such wise
Fro day to day as y shall you deuyse
This was the common wis of every man
The Emperor of rome god him se
A daughter has that since the world began
To rekene as well her goodness as her beauty
Was never such another as was she
I pray to god in honor here ^usteyne
And would she were of al Enrope the queen
In here is high beauty without pride
Yonghte without greef or folly
To all her werkis virtue is her gyde
Humbles has slain in here al tirannye
She is a myrrour of al courtesy
Her heart is verry chambir of holiness
Her hond mynyster of fredom and of alms
And all this wis is soth as god is true
But now to purpos let us turn ay^en
Thise marchan^tis have do fraught her shippis new
And when they have the blisful maid seyn
Home to surry they went a geyn
And don her nedis as they deed yore
And liuen well I can s^y no more
Now fill it the these marchauntis stood in grace
Of him that was the sow^^n of furrye
For when that they com fro any strange place
He would of his benign courtesy
Make hem good chere and bisely aspye
Tidyngis of sundry regnys forto lere
The wondrys that they might se and here
Among other thingis specially
Thise merchants have told of dame Co^stau^ce
So great noblesse in ernest certainly
That this sowdan has caught so great plesau^ce
To have her figure in his remembrance
And al his lust and al his besy cure
Was forto love here whilis his lif may endure
Parauenture in that large book
Which I clepe the heaven y write was
With sterrys that he his birthe took
Th^r he for love should have his death allas
F^^ in the sterrys clerer than is the glass
Is writyn god woot who so could read
The death of every man withouten dread
In sterrys many a winter there beforn
Was write the death of Ector and Achilles
Of Pompey Julius or they were born
The stryf of Thebes and of Hercules
Of Sampson Turnus and Socrates
The death but mennys wittis be so dull
That no man can read it at full
This sowdan for his pryuy counceil sent
And shortly on this matter forto pass
He has to hem declared his intent
And said hem certain but he might have grace
To have Custaunce in a litil space
He nas but ded and charged hem on hye
To shapen for him some remedy
Diverse men diverse things saiden
They argumentis casten up and down
Many a sotil reason forth they layden
They spak of magyk and abusion
But finally as in this conclusion
They can not see in that non advantage
Ne in non other wey save in marriage
Than saw they there ynne such difficultees
Be wey of reason to speak al plain
Be cause that there was such diuersitees
Betwix her both laws that they sayn
They trow that no christian prince would fayn
Wedden his child under our laws sweet
That us was taught be mahound our prophet
And he answered rathir than I lose
Custaunce I will be cristened doutles
I moot be heris I may non other chese
I pray you hold your argumentis in pees
Sauyth my lif and be not recheles
To geten here that has my lif in cure
For in this woe I may not long endure
What nedith gre^ter delectacion
I say be tretyse and ^lussetrye
And by the Popis mediacioun
And all the church and all the chiualrye
That in destruction of mawmetrye
And in encrees of cristis law dear
They be accorded as ye shul here
How that the Sowdan and his baronage
And all his liegis shul cristened ^e
And he shall have custaunce in marriage
And ertayn gold I not what quantyte
And thereto found they good ^urete
The same accord was sworn in either side
Now fair Custaunce almighty god the gyde
Now would sum men wene as I guess
That I should tell all the purueaunce
That the Emperor of his great nobles
Has shape for his daughter dame Custaunce
Well may men know that so great ordenaunce
May no man tell in a litil clause
As was arayd for so high a cause
Bisshoppis ben shapen with her forto wend
Lordis and ladies of great renoun
And other folk enough this is the end
And notifyed is thorough out the town
That every wight with deuocioun
Sh^lde pray crist that this marriage
Resceyue in gre and speed this viage
The day is com of her departing
I say that the woful^ day is come
That there may be no len^er taryynge
But forward they dress hem all and some
Custaunce that with sorrow is al ouercom
Full pale arisith and dress^th her to wend
For well she woot there is non other end
Allas what wonder it is though she wept
That shall be sent to strange nation
Fro frendis that here so tenderly kept
And to be bound under subjection
Of one she knows not the condition
Husbondis been all good and have be yore
That know wyuys I dar say no more
Fadir she said thy wrecchid child custaunce
Thy young daughter fostred up so soft
That most you loves with obeissaunce
Ouir all thing out take crist on lofte
Custaunce your child her recomaundith often
Unto your grace for I shall to surrye
Ne shall I never se you more with ye
Allas unto the barbarik nation
I must anon acordyng to your will
But crist that deyde for our redemption
So give me grace his hestis to fulfille
I wrecchid womman no sors though I spylle
Wommen are born to thraldom and to penance
And to be under mannys governance
I trow at troy when Turnus brac the wall
Of Ilion nor brent was Thebes the Cite
Ne rome for the sege of hanybal
That romans had venguysshed times three
Nas herd such tender weeping for pity
As was in the chambir for her departing
But forth she moot whether she weep or sing
O frosty morning cruel firmament
With thy dyurnal whele that crowdest ay
And hurtelist al fro este to occidente
That naturelly would hold another wey
Thy crowdyng set the heaven in such array
At the beginning of this first viage
That cruel marce has slain this marriage
O infortunat asc^ndant tortuous
Of which the lord is helples fall allas
Out of his angil in to the third house
O Marce occitaser as in this caas
O feeble moan unhappy be thy paas
Thou knettist the there thou art not resceyued
There thou art well fro then art thou weyuyd
Imprudent Emperor of rome allas
Was there no philisophir in thy town
Is no time bectir than anothir in this ca^s
Of viages is there non election
Namely to folk of high condition
Not when a rote is of a birthe y know
Allas we been to lewd and ellis to slow
To ship is brought this woeful fair maid
Solempuly with every circumstaunce
Now Ih^su crist be with you all she said
There is no more but far well fair Custaunce
She pynyth her self to make good contenaunce
And forth I let here saylle in this manner
And turn again I wol to my matere
The mother of the sowdan well of vicis
Aspyed has her sonys plain en^ent
How he would let his old sacrificis
And right anon she for her counsel sent
And they be come to know what she meant
And when assemblid was this folk in fere
She set her down and said as ye shul here
Lordinges quod she ye know well euerichon
How that my sone is in point forto let
The holy lawis of our alcaron
Yeuen by goddis messanger Machomete
But on a vow to the great god I hete
The lif shall rathir out of my body stert
Or machometis love go out of my heart
What should us tidyn of this new law
But thraldom to our body and penance
And aftirward in hell to be draw
For we reneyed Mahound our creaunce
But lordis will ye make assurance
As I shall say assentyng to my lore
And I shall make us sauf for euyrmore
They sworyn and assented every man
To live with her and dye and by her stand
And eueriche in the best wise that he can
To strength her shall his frendis fond
As she that has this empryse take on hand
Which ye shul here as I shall deuyse
And to hem all she spak in this wise
We shul us first feign cristendom to take
Cold watre ne shall us grieve but a lyte
And I shall such a feste and a revel make
That as I trow I shall the sowdon quyte
For though his wife be cristened neuyr so whit
She shall have need to wasshe awey the read
Though she a font full of water with her led
O sowdonnes rote of iniquyte
Virago thou samarian the secunde
O serpent under femenyn beauty
I lik unto the serpent deep in hell I bound^
O feyned woman all that may confound
Virtue and Innocence through thy malice
I bred is in the nest of every vice
O satan ennyous syn that day
That thou were chaced from our heritage
Well know thou to women the old way
Thou madist one to bring us in seruage
Thou wolt fordon this christian marriage
Thyn instrument so well a way the while
Makist thou of woman when thou will begy^e
This sowdonnesse whom I thus blame and weary
Let privily her counsel go her way
What should I longer in this tale tarry
She ridith to the Sowdan on a day
And said to him that she would renye her lay
And cristendom of prestis hond fonge
Repentyng her that she hethen was so long
Besechinge him to don her that honor
That she might have the christian folk to feste
To plesen hem I will do my labor
The Sowdan says I will do at your heste
And kneling thankid her of that request
So glad he was he nyste what to sey
She kyssid her sone and home she goth her wey
Aryuyd be this christian folk to land
In surry with a greet solemn route
And hastily this Sowdon sent his sonde
First to his mother and to all the regne about
And said his wife was come without doubt
And preyde her to ride ayens the queen
The honor of his regne to sustene
Greet was the prees and rich was the array
Of surriens and of Romans met in fere
The mother of the sowdon rich and gay
Resceyuyth her with all glad chere
As any mother might her daughter dear
And to the next cite there beside
A soft paas solempuly they ride
Naught trow I the triumph of Julius
Of which that lucan makith such a boost
Was ryaller ne more corious
Than was the assemble of this blisful ost
But this scorpion this wicked ghost
The sowdonnesse for all her flaterynge
Cast under this full mortally to stynge
The sowdon comyth him self sone aftir this
So rially that wonder was to tell
And welcomyth her with joy and blis
And thus with joy and blis I let hem dw^lle
The fruit of every tale is forto tell
Men thought it when time came for the best
That revel to stynt and men to go to rest
The time came this old Sowdonnesse
Ordeyneth has this feste of which I told
And to the feste christian men dress
In general both young and old
There may men revel and feste behold
And deyntees mo than I can deuyse
But al to dear they boughte it er they rise
O sodeyn woe that ever art successor
To wordly blis spreynt with bitterness
The end of our Joy and of our wordly labor
Woe occupies the fyn of our gladness
Herkyn this counsel for thy sikernesse
Up on thy glad day have in thy mind
The vnwaar woe that comyth the behind
For shortly to tell at o word
The sowdan and the christian euerichone
Been al to he wen and stiked at the board
But it were only dame Custaunce allone
This old Sowdonnes cursid crone
Has with her cursid frendis there don this deed
For she her self would all the contre led
Ne there was Surreyn none that was conuertid
That of the counsel of the Sowdan wotith
That he nas al to hewn or he astertid
And Custaunce have takyn as they hotith
And in a ship steerles god it wotith
They have her set and bid her learn to saylle
Out of S^rrye again in to Itaylle
A certain tresour that she thither led
And soth to sayn vitayl greet plente
They have her give and clothis eek she had
And forth she ^ayled in to the salt se
O my Custaunce full of benignite
O Emperors young daughter dear
He that is lord ouyr fortune be thy stere
She blissid her and with full pitous wis
Unto the cross of crist said she
O clear O woeful auter holy croye
Read of the lambis blood full of pity
That wesshist the world fro old iniquite
Me fro the fend and fro his clawis keep
That day that I shall drenche in the deep
Victorious tree of protection true
That only were ordained forto bear
The king of heaven with his woundis new
The white lamb that hurt was with a spear
Flemer of fendis out of him and of here
Of which thy lymes feithfully extend
Me keep and give me might to amend
Yeris and days fleet this creature
Through out the se of greek in to the streyte
Of Marrok as it was her adventure
O many a sorry meel may she beyte
Aftir her death full often may she wait
Or that the wild wawes would her drive
Unto the place where that she shall arryue
Men might ask why she was not slain
And ek at feste who might her body save
And I answer to that demand again
Who sauyd Daniel in the horrible Cave
There every wight were he maistir or knave
Was with the lioun fret or he a stert
No wight but god that he baar in his heart
God lust to show his wondirful miracle
In here for she should se his mighty werkis
Crist that is of every harm triacle
Be certain menys as known clerkis
Does thingis that for certain end full derk is
To mannys wit that for our ignorance
Ne can not know his prudent purueaunce
Now since that she nas at the feste y slawe
Who kept her fro drenching in the sea
Who kept Jonas in the fisshis mawe
Till he was spowted out at nynyue
Well may men know it was no wight but he
That kept the pepyl of Ebrew fro drenching
With dry foot thorugh out the sea passinge
Who has the four spiritis of tempeste
That power have to annoyen land and see
Both No^th and south west and Est
Annoyeth neither land house ne tree
Sothly the comaunder of that was he
That fro the tempest ay this woman kept
As well when she wook as when she slepte
Where might this woman mete and drynk have
Three year and more lastith her vitayl^
Who fed the Egipcian Mary in the Cave
Or in desert non but crist sauns faylle
Fyur thousand folk it was a great meruaylle
With louys five and fisshis two to feed
God halpe her alwey in her need
She dryueth fo^th in to our occian
Through out our wide se til at the last
Under an hold that nemene I ne can
Fer in Northumbirland the wawys her cast
And in the sond the ship stickid so fast
That thens would it not all that tide
The will of crist was there she should abide
The constabil of the castle down is fare
To se this wrakke and all the ship he sought
And fond this doutif womman full of care
He fond also the tresour that she brought
In her langage mercy she be sought
The lif out her body forto win
Her to deliver out of the woe that she was ynne
Amaner latin corupt was her speech
But algatis there by was she understand
The Constabil when him lift no longer seche
This woeful womman brought he to land
She knelith down and thankith cristis sonde
But what she was she would noman sey
For foul ne fair t^ough she should dye
She said she was so masid in the se
That she forgot her mind by her trowth
The Constabil has of her so great pity
And eke his wife that wepen sore for rowth
She was so diligent without slowthe
To serve and plese euerich in that place
That al her love that lokyn in her face
The Constabyl and dame hermegild his wife
Were paynemys and that contre every where
But hermegild louyd her as her life
And Custan^ce has so long I soiourned there
In orisoun with many a bittir tere
Till Ihesus has conuertid thorough his grace
Dame hermegilde the Constablis wife of the place
In all that land no christian durst route
All christian men be fled fro that contre
Thorough paynemes that conquered al about
The royame as well by land as by see
To wales then fled the Cristianite
Of old britons duellyng in that I Will
There was no refute for the mean while
But yet nere christian britons so exyled
That there nas some in her priuyte
Honouryd crist and hethen folk begilyd
And nygh the castle such there dwellid three
That one of hem was blind and might not se
But it were with thick yen of his mind
With which they seen aftir men be blind
Bright was the son as in a summers day
For which the Constabyl and his wife also
And Custaunce has take the right way
Toward the sea a furlong wey or two
To pleyen and to romen to and fro
And in this walk the blind men they met
Crokid and old with yen fast I shette
In the name of crist cryde this briton
Dame Hermegilde give me my sight ageyn
This lady wax afraid of that soun
Lest that her husbond shortly forto seyn
Would here for Ihesus cristis lore have sleyn
Til custaunce made her bold and bad her wirche
The will of criste as daughter of holy church
The constabil wexte abasshid of that sight
And said what amountith all this fare
Custaunce answerde sire it is cristis might
That helpith folk out of the fendis snare
And so ferforth she began our law declare
That she the Constable or it were eve
Converted has and on crist made him believe
This Constable was no thing lord of this place
Of which I spak there he Custaunce fond
But kept it strongly many wyntris space
Under alla king of al Northumbirlond
That was full wise and worthy of his hond
Ayens the scottis as men may well here
But turn again I will to my matere
Satan that ever us waytith to begyle
Saw of Custaunce all the perfection
And cast anon how he might quyte her while
And made a young knight dwelling in the town
Love here so hot of foul affection
That verily him toughte he shall spille
But he of here onys might have his will
He wowith her but it auaylith naught
She would do no sin be no way
And for despit he compassid in his thought
To make here on shamful death to day
He waytith when the Constabyl is away
And privily on a night he crepte
In hermegildis chambir whylis she slepte
Weary forwakid in her orisons
Slepith hermegilde and Constaunce also
This knight thorough satan's temptacions
Al softly is to the bed y goo
And ku^te the throat of hermegild a two
And leyde the blody knyf be dame Custaunce
And went his wey there god give him mischan^^e
Sone aftir comyth the Constabyl hom ayeen
And eke alla that was king of the land
And saw his wife dispitously sleyn
For whom he wept and wrong his hond
And in the bed the blody knyf he fond
Be dame Custaunce allas what might she say
For verray woe her wit was al a way
To king alla was told all this myschaunce
And the time and where and eke the wise
That in a ship was found this Custaunce
As here before ye me have herd deuyse
The kyngis heart of pity began arise
When he saw the benign creature
Fall in disese and in mysauenture
For as the lomb toward his death is brought
So stant this Innocent a fore the king
This false knight that has this treson wrought
Bears her in hond she ha^h do this thing
But natheles there was great morning
Among the pepyl and sayden they can guess
That she had not do so great a wickedness
For they have seye here euyr so virtuous
And loving hermegild right as her life
Of this baar witness euerich in that house
Save he that slow hermegild with the knyf
This gentil king has caught a great motif
Of this witness and thought he would inquire
Deppere in this aias and trowthe forto lere
Allas custaunce thou have no champion
Ne fight cans thou not so well away
But he that for our redemption
Bond satan and yet lith there he lay
He be thy strong champion this day
For but crist open miracle kithe
Without gilt thou shall be slain as swithe
She set her down on her knees and thus she said
Immortal god that sauedist ^usanne
Fro falls blame and thou mercyful maid
Mary I mean doughtir of saint anne
Before whose child aungelis sing Osanne
If I begiltles of this felonye
My socour be or ellis I shall dye
Have ye not se sum time a pale face
Of him that has be lad in a prees
Toward his death where he getith no grace
And such a color in the knyghtis face chees
Men might know his face in all the prees
Among all the faces that was in that Route
So stant Custaunce and lokith here about
O queen's lynage whilom in prosperity
Duchess and ladies euerichone
Have some rowthe on her aduersite
An Emperors daughter stont allone
She woot not to whom to make her moan
O ryal lady that stondist in this dread
Fer ben thy friends at thy greet need
This Alla has such compassion
As gentil heart is fulfillyd of pity
That from his yen ran the watir down
Now hastily go fet a book quod he
And if that this knight wol swear that she
Has this woman slain yet will we us auyse
Whom that we will shall be our Iustise
A briton book written with euangelies
Was fet and there on he swoor anon
She gilty was and in the mean whiles
An hond him smoot up on the neck boon
That down he fyl at onys as a stoon
And both his yen breast out of his face
In sight of every body of that place
A boys was herd in general audience
And said thou have disclaundryd giltlees
The daughter of holy church in high presence
Thus have thou done and yet I hold my pees
Of this meruayll aghast was all the prees
As masid folk they stonden euerichon
For dread of wreche save Custaunce alone
Greet was the dread and eke the repentance
Of hem that had wrong suspection
Up on this sely Innocente Custaunce
And for this mirakil in conclusion
And by Custaunces mediacion
The king and many another in that place
Conuertid was thankid be cristis grace
This false knight was slain for his untruth
By Ingement of the king alla hastily
And yet had Custaunce of his death great routhe
And aftir Ihesus of his mercy
Made alla to wedde her solemly
This holy maiden that is so bright and shore
And thus has crist maad Custaunce a qu^^e
But who was woeful if I shall not ly
Of this weddyng but donygelde and nomo
The kyngis modir full of tirannye
Her thought her cursid heart brast a two
She nolde not her sone had so do
Her thought a despyt that he should take
So strange a creature unto his make
Me list not of the chaf ne of the s^re
Make so long a tale as of the corn
What should I tell of the ryalte
Of this marriage or which cors goth beforn
Who blows in a trompe or who in a horn
The fruit of every tale is for to sey
They ^et and drank dance sing and pley
They go to bed as it is skyl and right
For though that wyuys be full holy thyngis
They must take in pacient a night
Such manner of necessaries as been plesingis
To folk that have weddid hem with ringis
And sey a litil her holiness a side
As for the time it may non other betyde
On here he begat a man child anon
And to a bishop and to his Constable eke
He took his wife to keep when he is gone
To scotlond ward his fomen forto seek
Now fair Custaunce that is so humble and so meke
So long is gone with child in that stylle
She kept her chambir abydyng cristis will
The time is come a man child she beer
Mauricius at the fontstoone they him call
This Constabyl does forth come a messanger
And wroot unto this king tht clepyd was all
How that this blisful tidingis is be fall
And other thing which was nedeful to say
He takith his lettre and forth he goth his way
This messanger to do his advantage
Unto the kings mother ridith he swythe
And salueth here fair in his langage
Madame quod he ye may be glad and blythe
And thanken god an hundrid thousand sith
My lady the queen has child withouten doubt
To joy and bliss of all this regne about
Lo here the lettres sealid of this thing
That I must here in all the haste I may
If ye will ought to your sone the king
I am your servant both night and day
Dame donegelde answerde all this tym^ nay
But here al night I wol thou take thy rest
To morrow I wol sey the what me lest
This messanger drank sadly ale and wine
And stolen were his lettres privily
Out of his box whilis he slepte as a swyn
And countrefetyd was full subtly
Anothir lettre wrought full synfully
Unto the king directyd of this matere
Fro his Constabil as ye may aftir here
The lettre spak the queen delivered was
Of so horrible a fendly creature
That in the Castle non so hardy was
There no while any wighte might endure
The modir was an elphe be adventure
I common be charms or be sorcerye
And every wight hates her in company
Woe was the king when he this lettre had se^n
But to no wight he told his sorowis sore
But of his owen hond he wroot ay^^n
Welcome the sonde of crist for evermore
To me that am learned in this lore
Lord welcome be thy lust and thy pleasaunce
My lust I put al in thy ordenaunce
Keep this child al be it foul or fair
And eke my wife unto mine hoom coming
Crist when him list may make me an heir
More agreabyl than this to my likynge
This lettir he selith pryuely weeping
Which to the messanger was y take sone
And forth he goth there is no more to done
O messanger fulfillid with dronkenes
Strange is thy breath thy lymys flateryn ay
And thou bewreyest al secretnes
Thy mind is lore thou iangesist as a Iay
Thy face is turned as in a new array
There dronkenesse reygneth in any rowte
There is no counsel it is no doubt
O donegelde I have non english digne
Unto thy malice and thy tirannye
And therefore to the feend I the resign
Let him endityn of his treytory
Fie mamysshe fie nay be god I ly
Fie feendly spirit for I dar well tell
Though thou here walk thy spirit is in hell
This messanger comyth fro the king agay^
And at the kyngis modr^s court he light
And she was of this messanger full fayn
And pl^sid him in all that ever she might
He drank and well his girdyl under pyghte
He slepith and he snortith in his gyse
Al night til the son began arise
Aftir were his lettres stolen euerichon
And countrefetid lettres in this wise
The king Comaundith his Constabil anon
Up pain of hongynge on high Iuyse
That he ne should suffer in no wise
Custaunce in his regne forto abide
Three days and a quartir of a tide
But in the same ship as he here fond
Here and her young sone and al her geer
He should put and croude fro the land
And charge her that she come never aftir there
O my Custaunce well may thy ghost have feer
And slepyn in thy dreme be penance
When donegelde cast all this ordenaunce
This messanger on morrow when he wook
Unto the Castle holdith the next way
And unto the Constabil he the lettris took
And when that he this pitous lettre say
Full often he said allas and well away
Lord crist quod he hou may this world endure
So full of sin is many a creature
O mighty god if that it be thy will
Sithen thou art rightful Judge hou may it be
That thou wolt suffer innocence to spylle
And wicked folk regne in prosperyte
O good Custaunce alas so woe is me
That I moot be thy turmentour or ellis dye
On shamful death there is non other remedy
Wepyn both old and young in that place
When that the king this cursid lettre sent
And Custaunce with a dedly and a paal face
The fair may toward the ship she went
But never the lees she takith it in good intent
The will of crist and knelynge on the stronde
She said ay welcome be thy sonde
He that me kept fro the false blame
Whylis that I was on the land among you
He can me keep fro blame and eke fro shame
In the salt se although ye se not hou
As strong as ever he was he is right now
In him I trust and in hes mother dear
That is to me my sail and eke my stere
Her litil child lay weeping in her arm
And kneling pitously she said
Pees litil child I wol do the non harm
With that the kerchief from her head she brayde
And over his litil yen it laid
And in her arm she lullith it full fast
And in to heuene up her yen she cast
Mother quod she and maid bright Marye
Soth is that through womannys egement
Mankind was lost and dampnyd ever to dye
For which thy child was on the cross to rent
Thy blisful yen saw all this turment
Than is there no comparison between
Thyn woe and my woe that man may sustene
Thou saw thy childryn slain a fore thyn yen
And yet now lives my litil child perfay
Now lady bright to whom all women crien
Thou glory of whomanhed thou fair may
Thou haven of refut bright sterre of day
Rewe on my child that of thy gentilnesse
Rewest on every synful in distress
O litil child allas what is thy gilt
That never wroughtest sin as yet perde
Why will thy hard fader have the spilt
O mercy and dear Constabil quod she
As leet my litil child dwell here with the
And if thou dare not save him fro blame
So kys him onys in his fadres name
Therewith she lokith bacward to the land
And said farewell husbond routhlees
And up she goth and walkith down the stronde
Toward her ship here folowith all the prees
And ever she prays her child to hold his pees
And takith her leave with an holy intent
She blissith her and in to the ship she went
Vitaylid was the ship it is no dread
Habundauntly for her long space
And other necessaries that should need
She had ynow heried be goddis grace
For wynd and wedir almighty god purchase
And bring her hoom I can no bettir sey
But in the sea she dryueth forth the wey
ALla the king sone aftir this
Unto his Castle of which I told
Asked where his wife and his child is
The Constabil began about his heart to cold
And pleynly all the manner he him told
As ye have herd I can it tell no bettir
And shewith the kyngis seel and his lettir
And said lord as ye comaundid me
On pain of death so have I do certain
This messanger turmentid was til he
Must be know and tell plat and plain
Fro night to night what place he had in layn
And thus be with subtle enquerynge
Imagened was be whom this began spring
The hond was known that the lettir wroot
And all the venym of this cursid deed
But in what wise certainly I not
The effect is this that alla out of dread
His mother slough that men may plainly read
For she traitor was to her ligeaunce
Thus endid old donegelde with a myschaunce
The sorou that this alla night and day
Makith for his wife and his child also
Th^re is no tunge that it tell may
But now wol I to Custaunce go
That fletith in the se with pain and woe
Five year and more as likyd cristis sonde
Or that her ship approchid to any land
Under an hethen castle at the last
The which the name not in my tixt I find
Custaunce and eke her child up cast
Almighty god that saves alman kind
Have on Custaunce and her child ^um mind
That fallen is in hethen land eftsone
In point to spille as I shall tell you sone
Down from the Castle comyth there many awight
To ganryn on this ship and on Custaunce
But shortly fro the Castle on a night
The lordis Steward god yef him myschaunce
A thief that had reyned our creaunce
Com in to the ship allone and said hou she should
His lemman be whether she would or nolde
Tho was this wrecchid womman woe be gone
Her child cryde and she pitously
But blissed mary help her anon
For with her strogeling well and myghtely
The thief fill over the board al suddenly
And in the se he dreynt for vengeance
And thus has crist vnwemmyd kept custan^ce
O foul lust of luxurye lo thyn end
Not only that thou feyntist mannys mind
But verily thou wolt his body shende
Then of thy werk and thy lustis blind
Is compleynynge hou many on may men find
That naught for werk sumtyme but fool intent
To do this sin be other sleyn or shent
How may this week womman have the strength
Here to defend ay^ns the renegat
O Golias unmeasurable of length
How mighty David made the so mate
So young of armure and so desolate
How durst he look up on thy face
Well may men seen it is but goddis grace
Who yaf Judith courage or hardiness
To sle Olefernes in his tent
And to deliueren out of wrecchidnesse
The pepyl of god I say to this intent
That right as god spirit and vigor sent
To hem and saved out of myschaunce
He sent strength and vigor unto Custan^ce
Forth goth her ship through out the narou mouth
Of Iuba^ter and septe driuyng ay
Some time west and some time north and south
And sometime est full meny awery way
Til cristis mother y blissid be she ay
Has shapen through her endlees goodness
To make an end of al her heaviness
Now let us stynte of Custan^ce but a throw
And speak of romans the Emperor
That out of rome has be lettris know
The slaughter of christian folk and dishonor
Done unto his daughter be a falls traitor
I mean the cursid and wicked sowdonnesse
That at the feste leet sle both more and less
For which this Emperor has sent anon
His senator with ryal ordenaunce
And other lordis god woot meny on
On ^urryens to take high vengeance
They brenne and sle and bring hem to myschaun^e
Full meny a day but shortly this is the end
Homward to rome they shapen hem to wend
This senator repayrith with victory
To romeward sailing full ryally
And met the ship as says the story
In which Cu^taunce sit full pitously
No thing knew he what she was ne why
She was in such array that she ne wol sey
Of here astat though she should deye
He bryngith her to rome to his wife
He yaf her to here and her young sone also
And with the senator ladde her life
Thus can our lady bring out of woe
Woeful Custaunce and many another mo
And long time duellyd she in that place
In holy workis ever was her grace
The senators wife her aunte was
But for all that she knew her never the more
I will no longer tarry in this caas
But to king Alla which I spak of yore
That had such sorrow as I said before
I wol return and let I wol Custaunce
Under the senators governance
King Alla which that had his mother slain
Up on aday fill in such repentance
And if I shortly tell shall and pl^yn
To rome he comes and receives his penance
And put him in the Popis ordenaunce
In high and low and Ihesus crist besoughte
Foryeue him the workis that he has wro^ght
The fame anon thorough rome is born
How alla king shall come a pilgremage
By herbegeous that wenten him beforn
For which the senator as was the usage
Rood him ayens and many of his lynage
As well to shown his magnificence
As to done any king reverence
Great chere does this nobyl senator
To king alla and he to him also
Every of hem does to other great honor
And so be fyl that on a day or two
This senator is to king alla go
To feste shortly and I shall not ly
Custaunces s^ne went in his company
Sum men would say at the request of Custan^ce
This senator had led this child to feste
I may not tell every Circumstaunce
Be as be may there was he at the least
But s^th it is right at his mother h^ste
Beforn alla during the mete space
The child stood lokyng in the kyngis face
Alla the king of this child has great wonder
And to the senator he said anon
Whose is this fair child that stondith yonder
I not quod he be god and be saint John
A mother he has but fader has he noon
That I of woot and shortly in a stounde
He told alla how the child was found
But god woot quod this senator also
So virtuous a liuere in all my lif
Ne saw I never ne herd of mo
Of wordly wymmen maiden wydow or wife
I dar well say she had lever with a knyf
Through out her breast than be awoman wyke
There is noman could bring her to the pryk
Now was this child as lik unto Custaunce
As possible is a creature forto be
This alla has the face in Remembrance
Of dame Custaunce and thereon musid he
If that the childis mother were aught she
That is his wif and privily he sight
And spedde him fro the tabyl all that he might
Parfay quod he the fanton is in mine head
I ought to deem of rightful Judgment
That in the salt se my wife is ded
And aftirward he made his argument
What woot I if crist have her hidir sent
My wife be se as well as he her sent
To my contre fro thens that she went
And aftir anon hoom with the senator
Goth alla for to se this wonder chaunse
This senator does alla great honor
And hastily he sent aftir Custaunce
But trust well her lust not to dance
When she wiste wherefore was that sonde
Vnnethis up on her feet might she stand
When alla saw his wife fair he her grette
And wept that it was routhe to se
For at ferste look that he on her set
He knew verily that it was she
And for sorrow as doumbe stondith as a tree
So was her heart shit in her distress
When she remembrith of his unkindness
Twys she swownyth in his owen sight
He wept and him excusid pitously
Now god quod he and his halowis bright
So wisly on my soul have mercy
That of your harm as giltles am I
As is my sone Maurice so lik your face
Ellis the fend me fecche out of this place
Long was the sobbyng and the bitter peyn
Er that her woeful heart might sece
Great was the pity forto here hem compleyn
Th^rou which pleyntis began her woe encrece
I pray you all my labor to relece
I may not tell her woe until to morrow
I am so weary forto speak of sorrow
But finally when the soth is wist
That all a giltlees is of her woe
I trow an hundred times they bekyste
And such a bliss is there betwix hem two
That save the joy that lastith ever mo
There nys noon I lik that any creature
Has s^ye or shall whylis the world may dure
Tho preyde she her husbonde mekely
In rel^synge of her pitous pain
That he would pray her fader specially
That by his mageste he would enclyne
To vouchesauf sumtyme with him to dyne
She prays him eek he should be no wey
Unto her fader no word of here sey
Sum men would seyn that the child Maurice
Does this message unto the Emperor
But as I guess alla was not so nyce
To him that is so souereyn of honor
As he that is of cristis folk the flour
Sent any child but it is best to deem
He went him self and so it may well seem
This Emperor has grauntid gentilly
To com to dinner as he him besoughte
This alla was ready he lokyd bysily
Up on this child and on his daughter thought
Alla goth unto his Inn and as him ought
Araid for this feste in every wise
As ferforth as his kunnynge may ^uffise
The morrow came alla began him dress
And eke his wife this Emperor for to mete
And forth they riden in joy and in gladness
And when she saw her fader in the street
She lightith down and fallith him to fete
Fader quod she your young child Custaunce
Is now full ^ken out of your remembrance
I am your daughter Custaunce quod she
That whilom ye have sent in to furrye
It am I fader that in the salt see
Was put alone and dampened forto dye
Now good fader mercy I you cry
S^^d me no more in to hethenesse
But thankith my lord here of his kyndenesse
Who can the piteous joy tell all
Betwix hem three sithenes they be thus met
But of my tale make an end I shall
The day goth fast I may no longer let
Thise glad folk to dinner be y set
In joy and bliss at mete I let hem duelle
A thousand fold more than y can tell
This child Maurice was since Emperor
I maad be the Pope and liuyd cristynly
To cristis church deed he great honor
But I let al these stories pass by
Of Custaunce is my tale specially
In old romans gestes men may well find
Mauricius life I bear it not in mind
Than king alla when he his time say
With Custaunce his holy wife so sweet
To engelond ben they come the right way
Where as they liuen in joy and in quyete
But lityl while it lasted I you behete
Joy of this world but a time it wol abide
Fro day to night it chaungith as the tide
Who lives ever in such delight a day
That ne meued is either in conscience
Or ire or talent or ^um kynnys affray
Envy or pride or passioun or offense
I ne sey but for the end of this sentence
That lityl while in joy or plesaunce
Lastith the bliss of alla with Custaunce
For death that takith of hye and low his rent
When passid was a year as I guess
Out of this world this king alla is went
For whom Custaunce has full great heaviness
Now pray we to god his soul bless
And dame Custaunce finally to say
Toward the town of rome goth her way
To rome is come this holy creature
And fyndeth her frendis there hole and sound
Now is she scapid al her adventure
And when she her fadir has y found
Down on her knees fallith to ground
Weeping in heart for tenderness blithe
She herieth god a hundred thousand sith
In virtue and in holy alms deed
They liuen all and never a sonder wend
Til death departed hem this lif they led
And farith now well my tale is at an end
Now Ihesus crist that of his might may send
Joy aftir woo govern us in his grace
And keep us all that been in this place
Here endith the man of lawis tale. And begins the squyeris prolog.
Our host in his stiroppis stondith anon
And said godemen herkeneth euerichon
This was a thristy tale for the nonys
Sire parissh priest quod he for goddis bonys
Tell us a tale as was thy forward yore
I se well that lernyd men in lore
Conne much good be goddis dignite
The Parson him answerde benedicite
What eylith the man so sinfully to swear
Our oste answerde Iankyn be ye there
I smelle a lollere in the wynd quod he
Now good men quod our host herkneth me
Abidith for goddis digne passioun
For we shul have now a predicacion
This lollare wol preche us here sumwhat
Nay be my fader soul that shall he not
Said the squire he shall not here preche
He shall no gospel gloss here ne teache
When leave all in the great god quod he
He would sow sum difficulte
Or speynh cokyl in our clean corn
And therefore o^te I warn the beforn
My ioly body shall a tale tell
And I shall clynke zow so merry a belle
That it shall wakyn all this company
But it shall not be of philosophy
Ne of phisik ne terms queynte of law
There is but litil latin in my mawe
Here begins the Squyers tale.
AT surrey in the land of Tartarye
There dwellid a king tht warrid on russy
Through which there did many a doughty man
This nobyl king was clepid Cambuscan
Which in his time was of so greet renoun
That there was nowhere in no region
So excellent a lord in all thing
He lackid naught that longed to a king
As of the sect of which he was born
He kept his lay to which he was sworn
And thereto he was hardy wise and rich
Pitous just and alwey y liche
Soth of his word benign^ and honorable
Of his courage as any tentir stabil
Young fressh and strong and in armies desirous
As any bacheler dwelling in his house
A fair person he was and fortunate
And kept alwey a ryal astaat
That there was nowhere such a man
This nobil king this tartir Cambuscan
He had two sonys on alphete his wife
Of which the eldest highte Algarsyf
That other sone was clepid Camballo
A daughter had this worthy king also
That youngest was and highte Canace
But forto tell you of her beauty
It lith not in my tunge ne in my connyng
I dar not take on me so high a thing
And also mine english eke is insufficient
I must be a clerk and a rethour excellent
That knew the colors longing to that art
If I should discrye her in every part
I am no such I must speak as I can
And so be fyl this Cambuscan
Has twenty winter bore his dyademe
As he went fro year to year y deem
He leet the feste of his natiuite
Done cry through out saray the cite
The last Idus of March aftir the year
Phoebus the son full ioly was and clear
For he was in his exaltacion
In martis face and in his mansion
In aries the hot colerik sign
Full lusty was the wethir and benign
For which the foulis ayens the son sh^ne
That for the seson and the young grene
Well loud song here affections
Hem semyd to getyn again here protectiouns
Again the swerd of winter kene and cold
And so this king of which I you told
In ryal vestimentis sat on his deys
With dyademe full high in his paleys
And holdith his feste solemn and rich
That in this world was there non it liche
Of which if I should tell all the ray
Than would it occupye a someris day
And eke it nedith not to deuyse
At every course the order of her seruise
I wol not tell of her strange sewis
Ne of her swannys ne of her heronsewis
Eke in that land as tellen knyghtis old
Is sum mete that is full deynte hold
That in this land men recke of it but small
There is noman that may reporten al
I wol not tarry you for it is pryme
And for it is no fruit but los of time
Unto my first tale y wol have my recours
And so befil that aftir the thridde course
While that this king sat in his high nobleye
Herkenyng his mynstrallis here thing pleye
Beforn him at his board deliciously
In at the halle door suddenly
There came a knight upon a stead bras
And in his hond a brood myrrour of glass
And on his thombe he had of gold a ryng
And be his side a nakid swerd hanging
And up he ridith to the high board
In all the halle ne was there spoke a word
For meruayll of this knight him to be hold
And bisely they wayten young and old
The strange knight that came so suddenly
Al armed save his head full richely
He saluyd the king queen and lordis all
By order as they sitten in the halle
With so high reverence and obeisaunce
As well in speech as in contenaunce
That Gawen with his old courtesy
Though he com aye^n out of feirye
Ne could him amend with a word
And aftir this before the high lord
He with manly voys said his message
Aftir the form used in his langage
Without faylle of sillabyl or lettir
And for his tale should seem the bettir
According to his word was his chere
As techith art of speech hem that it lere
Al be it that y can not sown his still
Ne y can not clymbe on so high an hille
Than say I thus to the common ^ntent
Thus much amountith that he meant
If it so be I have it in mind
He said the king of arabye and of ynde
My liege lord on this solemn day
Saleweth you as he best can and may
And sendith you honor at your feste
Be me that am al ready at your heste
This stead of bras that esely and well
Can in the space of a day naturel
This is to say in.xxiiij. houris
Where you list in drougthe or in showris
Bear your body to every place
To which your heart willith forto pase
Without wem of you thorough out foul or fair
Or if you list to fle as high in the air
As does an egil when him list to sore
This same stead shall bear you evermore
Without harm til ye be there ye list
Though that ye sleep on his ba^ or rest
And turn ayeen with wringyng of a pyn
He that it wroughte knows many a gyn
He waytid many a constellacion
Or he had wrought this operacion
And knew meny a skyl and meny abonde
This myrrour eke that I have in mine hond
Has such a might that men may in it se
When there shall fall any aduersite
Unto your regne or unto your self also
And openly who is your friend or foo
And over all this if any lady bright
Has set her heart in any manner wight
If he be falls she shall his treson se
His new love and al his subtilite
So openly that there shall no thing hyde
Wherefore agayns this lusty someris tide
This myrrour and this ring as ye may se
He sent has to my lady Canace
Your excellent daughter that is here
The virtue of this ring if ye wol here
Is this if that her list it forto were
Up on here thombe or in her purs it bear
There is no foul that flees under heuyn
That she ne shall understand his steuyn
And know his menyng openly and plain
And answer him in his langage again
And every gras that growith upon the rote
She shall know and whom it wol do bote
Al be his wound never so deep or wide
This nakid swerd that hangith be my side
Such virtue has what man ye smite
Through out his armure it wol kerue and byte
Were it as thick as a braunchid ook
And what man it woundith with the struck
He shall never be hool til ye list of grace
To stroke him with the plat in the same place
There he is hurt that is as mykyl to sayn
Ye moot with the plat swerd again
Stroke hem in the wound and it wol close
This is a verray soth withouten gloss
It fails not whylis it is in your hold
And when the knight has thus his tale told
He roood out of the halle and down he light
His stead which that shoon as the son bright
Stont in the court stille as any stoon
This knight in to the chambir is led anon
And is unarmed and to mete y set
The presentis be right richely kept
This is to say the swerd and the myrour
Been born anon in to the tour
With certain officers ordained therefore
And unto Canace this ring is bore
Solempuly there she sat at the tabyl
But sikr^ly withouten any fabyl
The horse of bras that may not be reme^yd
It stont as it were in the ground y cleuyd
For none engynys wyndas ne polyue
They may hit out of the place drive
And cause why for they con not the craft
And therefore in the place they have it laft
Til that the knight have taught hem the manner
To widen him as ye shul aftir here
Greet was the prees that swermyd to and fro
To gawrin on the horse that stood so
For it so high was so brood and so long
So well proporcioned to be strong
Right as it were a stead of lumbardye
Therewith so horsly and so quyk of ye
As it a gentil polin courser were
For certis from his tail unto his ere
Nature ne art could him not amend
In no degree as all the pepyl wend
But evermore her most wonder was
How that it could go and was of bras
It was of feire as all the pepyl semyd
Diverse folk diversely demede
As meny hedes. as meny wittis there been
They mormedyn as does a swarm of been
And maken skillys aftir her fantesie
Rehersynge of the old poetry
And said it was like the pegase
The horse that had wyngis forto fle
Or ellis it was the grekis horse Simon
That brought grekis unto destruction
As men in these old gestis read
Mine heart quod oon is evermore in dread
I trow sum men of armies be therynne
That shape hem this cite forto win
It were right good the al such thing were know
Another rowned to his fellow low
And said he lied for it was rathir lik
An appearance maad be some magik
As iogelours pleyn at the festis great
Of sundry thoughtis thus they iangil and trete
As lewd pepyl demen alday commonly
Of thingis that been maad more subtly
Than they konne in here boundis comprehend
They demyn gladly to the badder end
And some of them wondrid on the myrour
That born was up in to the maistir tour
How men might in it such thing^s se
An other answerde and said it may well be
Naturelly made by composicions
Of aungelis and of sly reflections
And said that in rome was such on
They spak of alteon and of vitelon
And of Aristotill that writin in her liuys
Of queynte myrours and of prospectatiuis
As know they that have her bokis herd
And other folk have wondrid on the swerd
That wol perissh thorough every thing
And fill in speech of Thelephus the king
And of Achilles for his queynte spear
For he could with it both hele and dear
Right in such wise as men may with the swerd
Of which right now ye have your self herd
They speken of s^ndry hardyng of metal
And speken of medicines therewith al
And how and when it should hardid be
Which unknow is algate to me
To speak than of Canaces ryng
And said that al such wonder thing
Of craft of ringis herd they never non
Save that be moses and be king Salamon
Had a manner conning of such an art
Thus seyn the pepyl and drawn hem apart
But nevertheless some said that it was
Wonder to make of fern glass
And yet is glass not lik ass^en of fern
But for they have know it so fern
Therefore secith her iangelinge and her wonder
As sore wondre some be cause of the thundir
On ebb on flood on gossomer and on myste
And on al thing til the cause is wist
Thus iangelyn they and demyn and deuyse
Til that the king began from his board arise
Phoebus has lost the angil meredional
And yet ascendyng was the b^st ryal
The gentil lioun with his aldryan
When that this tartir king Cambuscan
Roos from his board there he sat full hye
Beforn him goth the loud mynstralcye
Till that he came to his chambir of parementis
There as they sownyn dyners instrumentis
That is lik an heaven for to here
Now daunsen lusty venus children dear
For in the fish her lady sat full hye
And lokith on hem with a friendly ye
This nobil king is set up on his trone
This strange knight is fet to him full sone
And on the dance he goth with Canace
There is the revel and the Iolite
That is not abil adul man to deuyse
He must have know love and his seruise
And be as festliche man as fresh may
That shul you deuysen such array
Who could you tell the form of daunses
So uncouth and so fressh contenaunces
And thereto such subtle lokyngis
For dread of Ielosie of mennys preysinges
No man but Lancelot and he is ded
Therefore I pass over of all this lustihede
I say no more but in this iolynesse
I let hem til men to sopper hem dress
The stiward biddith spicis forto hye
And ^ke the wine in all this melodye
The ushers and the squiers ben gone
The spicis and the wine is comen anon
They ete and drink and when this was at end
Unto the tempyl as reason was they wend
The seruise don they have that day
What nedith you to reherce here array
Each man woot weel that a kyngis feste
Has plente to the most and to the least
And deyntees mo than be in my knowing
And aftir sopper goth this nobyl king
To se this horse of bras with all the route
Of lordis and of ladies him about
Such wondryng was thereof this horse of bras
That ^ethen the great sege of troy was
There as men saw such an horse also
Ne was there such a wondryng as was tho
But finally the king asked the knight
The virtue of this courser and the might
And prayde to tell him his gouernanuce
The horse anon began to trippe and dance
When that this knight leyde hond on his reyne
And said sire there is no more to said
But if you list to riden any where
Ye must trille a pyn that stont in his ere
Which I shall you tell betwix us two
Ye moot nempne him to what place also
Orto what cuntre ye list to ride
And when ye come there ye list abide
Bid him descend and trille another pyn
For there ynne lith the effect of all the gyn
And he wol down descend and do al your will
And in that place he would abide still
Theygh all the world had the contrary swore
He shall not thens be draw ne bore
And or if you li^t bid him thens goon
Trille this pynne and he wol vanysshe anon
Out of the sight of every manner wight
And come again be it be day or night
What that you list clepyn him aycen
In ^uche a gyse as I shall to you seyn
Between me and you and that right sone
Ride when you list there is no more to done
Enfourmed when the king was of the knight
And has conceived in his wit a right
The manner and the form of all this thing
Full glad and blithe was this nobyl king
Repeyryng unto his revel as beforn
The bridyl is in to the tour yborn
And kept among his jewels leef and dear
The horse vanysshed I not in what manner
Out of her sight ye get no more of me
But thus y let in lust and in iolite
This Cambuscan his lordis festeyng
Till well nygh the day began to spring
THe noryce of digestiouns the sleep
Began on hem wynke and bad hem take keep
That much mete and labor wol have rest
And with a galpyng ^^^uth he hem all keste
And said it was time to lie a down
For blood was in his domination
Cherisshed blood natures friend quod he
They thankyn him galpynge by two by three
And every wight began draw him to his rest
As sleep hem bad and took it for the best
Here dremys shul not be told for me
Full where here heedes of fumosite
That causith drew of which there is no charge
They slepyn til it was pryme large
The most part but if it were Canace
She was full mesurable as wommen be
For of her fader had she take her leave
To go to rest sone aftir it was eve
Here list not appalled forto be
Ne on the morrow vnfestliche for to se
And slept her first sleep and a wook
For ^uche ^oye she in her mirror took
Both of here ring and of her myrrour
That twenty time she chaungith color
And in her sleep for here impression
Of her mirror she had a vision^
Wherefore or the son began up glide
She clepid up her maistresse here beside
And said that her lust forto arise
These old wommen that been gladly wise
As her maistres answerde here anon
And said Madame whethir wol ye goon
Thus erly for folk been all in r^ste
I wool quod she arise for me lest
No lengir sleep but walken about
Her maistresse clepith wommen a greet route
And up they risen well ten or twelve
Up risith fresh Canace her selue
As rody and bright as the young son
That in the ram is ten degrees y run
No higher was she when she ready was
And forth she walkith esely a paas
Arayd aftir the lusty seson sote
Lightly forto pl^y and walkyn on foot
Not but.v. or vj. of her meyne
And in a trenche far in a park goth she
The vapor which fro the earth glode
Makith the son to seem rody and brood
But nevertheless it was fair of sight
That it made all her hertis for to light
What for the seson and the Morning
And for the fowlis that she herd sing
For right anon she wiste what they meant
Right be here song and knew al here intent
The knotte why that every tale is told
If it be tarried til lust be cold
Of hem that have it harkened aftir yore
The savor passith and ever longer the more
For fulsamnes of prolixite
And by the same reason thinkith me
I should unto the knotte condescende
And make of her walkyng an end^
A mydde a tree for dread as white as chalk
As Canace was pleyynge in her walk
There sat a fawoon over her head full hye
That with a pitous voys so began to cry
That all the wode resowned of her cry
And be^en had her self so pitouslye
With both her wyngis til the read blood
Ran endlong the tree as she stood
And euyr in one she cryde alwey and shright
And with her bek her self she pyght
That there nas tigre nor cruel best
That duellith other in wode or in forest
That would have wept if he weep could
For sorrow of her shriche alwey so loud
For there was never yet man on live
If that he could a faucon well descryue
Or herd of such anothir of feirnes
As well of plumage as of gentilnes
Of shap of all that might rekened be
A fawoon peregryn than seemed she
Of fremd land and evermore as she stood
She swowned now and now for lak of blood
Til well nygh is she fallen fro the tree
This fair kyngis daughter Canace
That on her finger baar the queynte ryng
Through which she understood well every thing
That any foul may in his leden seyn
And could answer in his leden again
She has understand what this faucon seyde
And well nygh ^or routhe she deyde
And to the tree she goth full hastily
And on this faucon lokith full pytously
And held her lap a brood for well she wiste
The faucon must fall fro the twiste
When that it swowned next for lak of blood
Alonge while to wait where she stood
Til at the last she spak in this manner
Unto the hawke as ye shul aftir here
What is the cause if it be forto tell
That ye be in this furial pain of hell
Quod Canace unto this hawk above
Is this sorrow of death or ellis of love
For as I trow these been the causis two
That causith most a gentil heart woe
Of other harm it reckith not to speak
For your self up on your self would wreke
Which that preuyth well that other Ire or dread
Mot be encheson of your cruel deed
Syn that I se non other wight you chase
For love of god so do your self grace
Or what may be your help for west ne est
Saw I neuy^ or now brid nor best
That ferde with him self so pitously
Ye sle me with your sorrow verily
I have of you so great compassion
For goddis love com fro the tree adoun
And as I am a kings daughter true
If that I verily the causis knew
Of your disese if that it lay in my might
I would amend it or it were night
As wis help me great god of kind
And h^rbis shall I right ynowe find
To hele ^ith your hurtis hastily
Tho shright this faucon more pitously
Than ever she did and fyl to ground anon
And lith aswowne as ded as any stoon
Till Canace has in her lap y take
Unto time she began out of her swowne awake
And aftir that she out of swoun began brayde
Right in her hawkis leden thus she said
That pity rennyth sone in gentil heart
Feling is simylitude in peynes smerte
Is prouyd alday as men may se
As well by work as by auctorite
For gentil heart kidith gentilnesse
I se well that ye have of my distress
Compassioun my fair Canace
Of verry wommanly benignyte
That nature in your principlis has set
But for no hope forto fare the bet
But forto obey to your heart fre
And forto make other be waar be me
As by the whelp chastised is the lioun
Right for that cause and that conclusioun
While that I have leyser and spaas
Mine harm y will confess er I paas
And ever while that on her sorrow told
That other wept as she to water would
Til that the faucon bad her be stille
And with a sigh thus she said her will
There y was bred allas that day
And fostrid in a roche of marbyl gray
So tenderly that no thing aylid me
I ne wiste what was aduersite
Till I could fle full hye under the sky
Tho dwelled a tarcelet me fast by
That seemed well of al gentilnes
Al were he full of treson and falsnes
That is wrappid under humble chere
And under hue of truth in such manner
Under plesaunce and under besy pain
That no wight would have wend he could feyne
So deep in greyn he died his colors
Right as a serpent hidith him under flouris
Til he may see his time forto byte
Right so this god of love this Ipocryte
Does so his s^rymoyns and his obeysauncis
And kepith in semblaunce al his obseruauncis
That s^wneth unto gentilnesse of love
As in a tomb is all the feyr above
And under is the corpse such as ye woot
Such was this Ipocrit both cold and hoot
And in this wise he seruid his intent
That save the fend noman wist what he meant
Til he so long had wept and compleyned
And meny a year his seruise unto me feyned
Til that my heart to pitous and to nyce
Al Innocent of his crowned malice
For ferd of his death as thought me
Up on his othis and his suerte
Grant him love up on this condition
That euermo mine honor and my renoun
Were saved both pryue and apert
This is to seyn that aftir his desert
I yaf him al my heart and al my thought
God woot and he and other wise naught
And took his heart in change of mine for ay
But soth is said goon seth is many aday
A true wight and a thief think not on
And when he saw the thing so fer agon
That I grauntid him my love
In such agyse as y have said above
And give him my true heart as fre
As he swoor he yaf his heart to me
Anon this tigre full of doubilnesse
Fill on his knees with so great humbleness
With high reverence and as by his chere
So lik a gentil lover in manner
So rauysshed as it seemed for joy
That never Troylus ne Paris of Troy
Jason certis ne non other man
Syn lameth was that alder first began
To louen two as written folk beforn
Ne never since that first man was born
To any womman were she never so wise
So payntid ^e his chere at point deuyce
As well his wordis as his contenaunce
And so I loved him for his obeisaunce
And for the trowthe I demed in his heart
That y^ so were that any thing him smert
Al were it never so lite and I it wiste
Me thought I herd death at my heart twiste
And shortly so ferforth this thing is went
That my will was his willis instrument
This is to sey my will obeyed to his will
In all thing aftir that reason fyl
Keeping the boundis of my worship ever
Ne never had y thing so leef ne lever
As him god woot ne never shall nomo
This lastid longer than a year or two
That I ^upposid of him no thing but good
But finally thus at the last it stood
That fortune would that he must twynne
Out of that place which I was Inn
Where me was woo it is no questioun
I can not make of it description
For o thing dar y tell boldly
I know what the pain of death is thereby
Such harm I met that he ne might me leave
So on a day of me he took his leave
So sorowfully eke that y wend verily
That he had felt as much sorrow as I
When that I herd him speak and saw his hew
But nevertheless I thought he was so true
And eke that he repair should again
With ynne a litil while soth to sayn
And reason would eke that he most go
For his honor and often it fallith so
That I made virtue of necessite
And took it well syn it needs most be
As I best might I hid fro him my sorrow
And took him be the hond se^^t John to borow
And I said thus lo I am youris al
Both such as I have be to you and shall
What he answerde nedith not to reherce
Who can say bet than he that can do wers
When he has al said than has he done
Therefore behooves him to have a long spoon
That shall ete with a fend thus herd I say
So act last he must forth his way
And forth fleith til he com there him lest
When it came him to purpos for to rest
I trow he had the text in mind
That al thing repeyrith to his kind
Gladith him self thus sey men as I guess
Men love of propir kind newefangilnesse
As briddis done that men in cagis feed
For they thou night and day take of hem head
And straw her cage feyre and soft as silk
And give hem sugar honey bred and mylk
Yet right anon as his door is up
He with his feet spurneth down his cup
And to the wode he wol and worms ete
So newfangil ben they of her mete
And love noueltees of proper kind
No gentilnesse of blood may him bind
So ferde this Tarcellet allas the day
Though he were gentil born fresh and gay
And goodly forto se humble and fre
He saw up on a time a kyte fle
And suddenly he louyd this kyte so
That al his love is clean fro me go
And has his truth falsid in this wise
Thus has the kyte my love in his seruise
And I am lorn without remedy
And with that word this faucon began to cry
And swouned eft in Canaces arm
Greet was the sorrow for the hawkis harm
That Canace and all her women made
They nyste how they might the faucon glade
But Canace hoom berith her in her lap
And softly in plasteris began her wrappe
There as she with her bek had hurt her selue
Now can not Canace but herbis delue
Out of the ground and make plastris new
Of herbis precious and fine of hew
To hele with the hawk fro day to night
She does her besines and al here might
And by her beddis head she made a mewe
And covered it with veluettis blewe
In sign of truth that is in women seen
And al without the mewe y peyntid green
In which were pryntid al these false s^ulis
As been these tidi^^is tarcellis and owlis
Right for dispyt were peyntid her beside
Pies on them forto cry and to chyde
Thus let I Canace her hauk keeping
I wol as now no more speak of her ryng
Til it come efte to purpoos forto sayn
How that this faucon gat her love again
Repentyng as the story tellith us
Be mediacion of Cambalus
The kyngis sone of which I zou told
But hens forth I wol process hold
To speken of auenturis and of batayllis
That yet was never herd so great meruayllis
First y wol you tell of Cambuscan
That in his time many a cite wan
And aftir will y speak of algarsif
How that he wan Theodora to his wif
For whom full often in greet peril he was
Ne had he be holpyn be the horse of bras
And aftir wol I speak of Camballo
That faught in listis with brethren two
For Canace or that he might here wynn^
And there I left I wol again begin
Appollo whirlith up his chare so high
Til that god Mercurius the sligh
Here endith the squy^ris tale. And begins the Marchan^tis prolog.
Weeping and waylinge care and other sorrow
I know I nough both even and ek a morrow
Quod the merchant and so does other mo
That weddid be I trow that it be so
For well I woot it fares so be ^e
I have a wife the worste that may be
For though the feend coupled to ^ere were
She would him ouermacche y dar well swear
What should I you reherce in special
Her high malice she is a shrewe at al
There is a long and a large difference
Betwix grisildis great patience
And of my wife the passing cruelte
Were I unbound also mot I the
I would never efte come in the snare
We weddid men live in sorrow and care
A say who so wol and he shall find
That y say soth be saint Thomas of Inde
As for the more part I say not al
God shilde that it should so be fall
A good sir oost I have weddid be
These monethis two and no more parde
And yet I trow he that has al his lif
Weddid be though men would him ryf
Into the heart ne could in no manner where
Tell so much sorrow as I now here
Could tell of my wives cursidnes
Now quod our often merchant so god you bliss
Syn ye so mykil konne ^f that art
Full h^rtely I pray you tell us part
Gladly quod he but of mine owen sore
For sorry heart I tell may no more
Here endith the prolog. And begins the Marchauntis tale.
Sometime there was duellynge in lumbardye
A worthy knight that born was at pauy
In which he liuyd in great prosperyte
And lx. year a wyfl^es man was he
And folowyd his bodily delyt
On women was his hool appetyt
As done these folis that been seculer
And when that he was passid lx. year
Were it for holiness or for dotage
I can not say but such a great courage
Had this knight to be a weddid man
That day and night he does all that he can
To aspye where he might weddid be
Prayyng our lord grauntinge that he
Might onys know that blisful lif
That is betwix an husbonde and his wife
And forto live under the holy bond
With which god first man and wom^an bond
Non other lif said he is worth a been
For wedlok is so esy and so clean
That in this world it is a paradise
Thus said this old knight that was so wise
And certainly as soth as god is king
To take a wife it is a glorious thing
And namely when a man is old and hoor
Then is a wife the fruit of his tresoor
Than should he take a young wife and a feir
On which he might engendre him an heir
And led his lif in joy and in solace
Where as these bachelors syngen allas
When that they find any aduersite
In love which that is but childis vanite
And trewly it sit well to be so
That bachelors have often pain and woo
On brotil ground they bilde brotilnesse
They find freelte when they wene sikirnesse
They live but as a brid or as a best
In liberte and under non areest
There as a weddid man is in astaat
Lives his lif blisful and ordinate
Under the yok of marriage I bound
Well may his heart in joy and bliss habound^
For who can be so buxum as a wife
Who is so true who is so tentif
To keep him seek and hool and is his make
For weel or woo she wol not him forsake
She is not weary him to love and serve
Though he lie bedrede til he sterue
And yet some clerkis sayn it is not so
Of which Theophraste is on of tho
What fors theygh Theophraste does lie
Ne take no wife quod he for husbondrye
As forto spare in household thyn expense
A true servant does more diligence
Thy good to keep than does thy self wife
For she wol claim half part al her lif
And if that thou be seek so god me save
Thy verey frendis or a true knave
Wol keep the bet than she that waytith ay
Aftir thy good and has do meny a day
But take no keep of such vanyte
Do fie Theophraste and harken me
A wife is goddis ziste verily
Al other manner zistis hardely
As londis rentis pasturis and com^une
Or other yeftis meuable of fortune
That passen as a shadow on a wall
But dread not if I plainly speak shall
A wife will last and in thy house endure
Well longer than the list perauenture
Marriage is a full greet sacrament
Who that has no wife is but shent
He liuyth helples and is al desolat
I speak of folk in seculer astat
And harken why y say not this for naught
The womman is for mannys help y wrought
The high god when he had Adam makid
And saw him allone belly nakid
God of his great goodness said than
Let us now make an help to this man
Lik to him self and than he made eve
Here may ye se and here by preue
That a wife is mannys help and his comfort
His paradyse terrestre and his disport
So buxum and so virtuous is she
They must nedis live in unite
O flessh they be and of o blood I guess
Not but one heart in will and in distress
A wife a saint mary benedicite
How might aman have any aduersite
That has a wife certis I can not sey
The bliss that is betwix hem twey
There may no tunge tell it or heart think
If he be pour she helpith him to swynke
She kepith his good and wastith it never a deel
And all that her husbond lust she likith weel
She says not onys nay when he says ye
Do this says he al ready sire says she
O blisful order o wedlok precious
Thou art so merry and ^ek so Joyous
And so comendid and approved eke
That every man that holds him worth a leek
Up on his bare knees ought al his lif
Thankin his god that him sent a wife
Or ellis pray g^d him forto send
A wife to last to his lives end
For than his lif is set in sik^cnesse
He may not be disceyued as y guess
So that he work aftir his wives read
Than may he boldly bear up his head
They be so true / and thereto eke so wise
For which if thou wolt worche as the wise
Do alwey as the woman wol the read
Lo how Jacob as these clerkis read
Be good counsel of his mother rebek
Bond the kiddi^ skyn about his nek
For which his fadris benyson he wan
Lo Judith as the story well tell can
Be wise counsel she goddis pepil kept
And slew him Olofernes while he slepte
Lo how Abigayl be good counsel that she
Saved her husbonde Nabal when that he
Should have be slain and look hester also
Be good counsel delivered o^^ of woe
The pepyl of god and made ^ardoche
Of assuere enhaunced forto be
There is no thing in gre superlatif
As says Senek above an humble wife
Suffer thy wyuys tunge as Caton bit
She shall comaunde and thou shall suffer it
And yet she will obey of courtesy
A wife is keeper of thy husbondrye
Well may the seek man bewail and weep
There as no wife is the house to keep
I warn the if thou wisely wilt wirche
Love well thy wife as crist loves his church
If thou love thy self thou love thy wife
Noman hatith his flessh but in his lif
He suffrith it and therefore bid I the
Cherisshe thy wife or thou shall never the
Husbonde and wife what so men iape or pley
Of wordly folk holden the right wey
They been knyt there may no harm be tide
And namely on the wyuys side
For which this January of which I told
Considerith has in his days old
The lusty lif the virtuous quyete
That is in marriage honey sweet
And for his frendis on aday he sent
To tell the effect of his intent
With face sad he has his tale to hem told
He said frendis I am hoor and old
And almost god woot at n^y pittis brynke
Up on my soul somewhat most y think
I have my body folily dispendid
I blissid be god it shall be amendid
For I wol be certain a weddid man
And that in all the haste that I can
Unto some maid fair and tender of age
I pray you shapith for my marriage
Al suddenly for I wol not abide
And I wol fond to aspye on my side
To whem y may be weddid hastily
But for as much as ye be mo than I
Ye shul rather such a thing espyen
Than I and where me list best alien
But o thing I warn you my frendis dear
I will noon old wife have in no manner
She shall not pass.xvj. year certain
Old flessh would have young flessh fayn
Bet is a pyke than a pykerel
Better than old beef is the tender veel
I wol no woman of twenty year of age
It is but been straw and greet forage
And eke these old wydowes god it woot
They conne so mykyl craft of wadis boot
So mykyl harm what that hem list
That with hem should I never live in rest
For sundry scolis makith subtle clerkis
Woman of many a scole half a clerk is
But certainly a young thing may men gye
Right as a man with hondis warm wexe plye
Therefore I say you pleynly in a clause
I wol non old wife have for this cause
For if so were if y had such myschaunce
That I in here could have no plesaunce
Than should I led my lif in avontrye
And so straight to the deuel when y dye
Ne children should I non on here getyn
Yet had I leuyr houndis had me etyn
Than that mine heritage should fall
In strange hond and thus I tell you al
I doubt not I woot the cause why
Men should wedde and ferthermore woot I
There spekith meny men of marriage
That woot no more of it than does my page
For which causis men should take a wife
If he may not chaste be. be his wife
Take him a wife with greet devotion
Be cause of lefful procreacion
Of childryn to the honor of god above
And not only for paramour ne for love
And for they should lecherye eschew
And yield her debt while it is new
Or for that each man should help other
In myschief as the sustir shall the brothir
And live in chastity full heavenly
But sires be your leave that am not I
For god bethankid I dar make auaunt
I feel my lymys stark and sufficiaunt
To do all that aman behooves to do
And am strong enough to ride or goo
Though I be hoor and fare as does a tree
That blesmeth or that the tree grene be
A blosmed tree is neither dry ne ded
I feel me no where hoor but on mine head
My heart and my lymes is ay grene
As laurer that through the year is seen
And sithnys ye have herd al mine intent
I pray you that to my will ye assent
Diverse men diversely him told
Of marriage meny ensamplis old
Some blamed it some preysid it certain
But at the last shortly forto seyn
As alday falls altercacion
Betwix frendis in disputacion
There fyl a strif betwix his brethren two
Of which that on was clepid placebo
Placebo said o January brother
To you tell I this tale and to non other
Full litil need had ye my lord so dear
Counsel to ax^ of any that is here
But that ye be on so full of sapience
That you ne likith for your high prudence
To weyue fro the word of Salamon
This word s^yde he to us euerichon
Work al thing be counfel thus said he
And than shall not thou repent the
But though Salamon spak such a word
Mine owen dear brother and my lord
So wyssely god my soul bring at rest
I hold your owen counsel for the best
For brother mine of me take this motyf
I have be a courtman al my life
And yet god woot though y unworthy be
I have stand in full great degree
About lordis in full great astaat
Yet had I never with non of hem debaat
I never contraried hem trewly
I woot well that my lord can more than I
What that he seith I hold it ferm and stabil
I say the same or other thing semblable
A full great fool is any counselour
That seruith a lord of high honor
That dar presume or onys think it
That his counsel should pass his lordis wit
Nay lordis be no folis be my fay
Ye have your self spoken here to day
So high sentence so holy and so well
That I consent and conferme eueridel
Your wordis and al your oppinion
Be god there is noman in this town
Ne in ytaille could better have said
Crist holdith him of this full well paid
And trewly it is an high courage
Of any man that stepped is in age
To take a young wife for be my ^ader kyn
Your heart hongith up on a ioly pyn
Does now in this matter as you lest
For finally I hold it for the best
Iustimis that ay sat full stille and playde
He right on this wise to Placebo said
Now brother mine quod he be pacient I pray
Syn ye have said herkyn what I say
Senek among other wordis wise
Says that aman ought him right well auyse
To whom he yeuyth his good or his catel
And sithnes I ought me auyse right well
To whom I give my good awey fro me
Well more I ought for to auyse me
To whom I give my body for alwey
I warn you well it is no childis play
To take a wife without auysement
Men must enqueren this is mine assent
Whether she be wise sobir or dronklew
An out goar or other wey a shrewe
A chidar or a wast^r of thy good
Rich or pour or of manners wood
Al be it so that noman find shall
Noon in this world that trottith hool in all
Ne man ne best such as men can deuyse
But neuyrthelees it ought ynow suffyse
With any if so were that she had
Moo good virtues than vicis ^adde
And all this axed leyser to enquere
For god it woot I have wept full meny a tere
Full pryuely sin I had a wife
Preyse who so wol a weddid mannys life
Certain I find it but cost and care
And obseruauncis of all blissis bare
And yet god woot mine neyghebours about
And namely of wommen meny a route
Sayn that I have the must steadfast wife
And eek the mekest one that berith life
But I woot best where wringith me my sho
Ye may for me right as ye like do
Auisith you ye be a man of age
How that ye entren in to marriage
And namely with a young wife and a feir
Be him that made watir earth and heir
The youngest man that is in all this route
Is besy enough to bring it about
To have a wife alone but trusts me
Ye shul not plesen hire only yeris three
This is to sayn to do her plesaunce
A wife axeth full meny an obseruaunce
I pray you that ye be not evil apayd
Well quod this January have thou said
Straw for thy senek and for thy prouerbis
I count not a paner full of herbis
Of scole terms wyser men than thou
As thou have herd has sentid right now
To my purpos Placebo what sey ye
I sey it is a cursid man quod he
That lettith matrimony sikirly
And with that word they risyn suddenly
And been assentid anon that he should
Be weddid when him list and when he would
The fantesye and the besy coriousnesse
Fro day to day began in the soul impresse
Of January about his marriage
Many fair shap and meny fair visage
There passith through his heart night be night
As who so took a myrour polisshed bright
And set is in a common market place
Than should he se many a figure pace
Be this myrour and in the same wise
Began January in his thought deuyse
Of maidens which duellid there beside
He wiste not where he might abide
For though that on have beauty in her face
Anothir stont so in the peplis grace
For her sadness and her benignyte
That of the pepyl greet voys had she
And some were rich and had badde name
But nathelees betwix ernest and game
He at last appointed him on on^
And leet all other fro his heart gon^
And chose her on his own auctorite
For love is blind alday and may not se
And when he was in his bed brought
He portreyed in his heart and in his thought
Her fressh beauty and her age tender
Her myddyl small and her armies long and slender
Her wise governance and her great gentilnesse
Her wommanly beryng and her sadness
And when he was on her condescendid
Him thought his thought might not be ame^did
For when he him self concluded had
Him thought every other mannys wit so badde
That impossible it were to replye
Ayens his chois this was his fantesie
His frendis sent he to at his instaunce
And prayde hem to do him that plesaunce
That hastily they would to him com
He would abregge her labor al and some
Nedith no more for him to go ne ride
He was appointed there he would abide
Placebo came and eke his frendis sone
And alderfirst he bad hem all abone
That non of hem non argumentis should make
Ayens the purpoos which that he had y take
Which was plesaunt to god said he
And verry ground of his prosperity
He said there was a maiden in the town
Which that of beauty had great renoun
Al were it so she was of small degree
Suffisith him her yowthe and her beauty
Which maid be said should be his wife
To lead in ese and holiness his lif
And thank god that he might have her all That no wight with his bliss parten shall
And prayde hem to labor in this need
And shapith that he faylith not to speed
For than he fayde his spirit was at ese
Than is quod he no thing me may displese
Save o thing prickith me my conscience
The which I wol reherce in your presence
Ye have herd said full long sithnis a goo
Thermay noman have parfit blissis two
This is to sey in er^he and eek in heuyn
For they he kept him fro the synnys seuyn
And eke from eueriche branch of that tree
Yet is there so parfyt prosperity
And so great ese and lust in marriage
That ever I am aghast now in mine age
That I shall led so merry a lif here
For sithen very heaven is bought so dear
With tribulacion and great penance
How should I live in such plesaunce
As all weddid men done with her wyuys
Come to the blis there crist etern on live is
This is my dread as yet my brethren twey
Assoylith me this question y you prey
Justinius which that hatid his folly
Answered anon right in his ^apery
And for he would his long tale abregge
He would non auctorite a leg
But said sir if there be non obstakyl
Other than this god of his high mirakyl
And of his mercy may so for you wirche
That er ye have your rightis of holy church
Ye may repent of weddid mannys life
In which ye say there is no stryf
And ellis god forbede but if he sent
A wedded man grace him to repent
Well ofter rather than a sengil man
And therefore the best read that I can
Dispeyrith you not but have in memory
Parauenture she may be your purgatory
She may be goddis mean and goddis whippe
That shall make your soul in to heuyn skippe
Swifter than an arow does out of a bow
I hope to god her aftir shul ye know
That there nys noon so greet felicite
In marriage ne memory shall be
But that hit may be your salvation
So that ye use it as skill is and reason
The lustis of your wife temperatly
And that ye plese her not to amerously
And that ye keep you eke from other sin
My tale is done for my wit is thynne
Beth not aghast here of my brother
But let us wade fro this matter to another
The wife of bathe if ye have understand
Of marriage which I have in hand
Declared has full well in litil space
Fares now well god have you in his grace
And with this he with his brother
Has take her leave and each of hem of other
For when they saw it must nedis be
So they wroughte be slighte and by trete
That this maid which that may highte
As hastily as that they might
Shall weddid be unto January
I trow it were you to long to tarry
If I you told of every es^rit and bond
Be which she was feffed in his land
Other forto hark of her rich array
But finally common is the day
That to church both been they went
Forto resceyue the holy sacrement
Forth comyth the priest with stole about his neck
And bad her be like Sarra or rebek
In wisdom and truth of marriage
And said his orisons in his usage
And crowchid hem and bad god should him bles
And made al siker ynow with holiues
Thus been they weddid with solempnyte
And at the feste si^tith he and she
With other worthy folk up on the deys
Al full of joy and bliss is the Paleys
And full of instrumentis of and vitayl
The most deynteous of all Itayl
Beforn him with instrumentis of such a soun
That Orpheus of Thebes or Amphioun
Ne made never such a melodye
At every course came loud mynstralsie
That neuyr Ioab trompid forto here
Neither he Theomodas half so clear
At thebes when the cite was in doubt
Bachus the wyn hem shenkith al about
And venus lowh upon every wight
For January was becomen her knight
And would both assayen his courage
In liberte eke as in marriage
And with here fierbrond with her hond about
Daunsith beforn the bayde al about
And certeynly I dar well sayn right this
Emenius that god of weddyng is
Saw neuyr in his lif so merry a weddid man
Hold thou thy pees thou poet Marcian
That writist us that ilke weddyng merry
Of her philogye and of him Mercurye
And of songis that the Musis song
So small and eke the pen and eke the tongue
Forto discriuen of this marriage
When tender youth had weddid stouping age
There is such that it may not be write
Assay you self and than may ye wit
If that I lack or none in this matter
May that sit with so benign chere
Here to be holden it seemed a fairye
Queen hester lokid neuyr with such an ye
On assuere so meke a look as she
I may you not deuyse al her beauty
But thus much of her beauty tell I may
That she was lik the bright morrow of day
Fulfillyd of beauty and of plesaunce
This January is rauysshid in atraunce
At every time he lokid in her face
But in his heart he began her manace
That night in his armies he would her streyne
Harder than Paris ever deed Eleyne
But natheles yet had he great pity
That that night offend her must he
And thought allas o tender creature
Now would god she might well endure
Al my courage it is so sharp and kene
I am aghast she may not sustene
But god forbede y deed al my might
Now would god it were woxe night
And that the night would last euermo
I would all this pepyl were ago
And finally he does al his labor
As he best might saving his honor
To haste hem fro the mete in subtle wise
The time came that reason was to rise
And aftir that men daunsid and drank fast
And spicis al about the house they cast
And full of joy and bliss is every man
All but a squier that highte Damyan
Which carf before the knight meny a day
He was so rauysshed on his lady May
That for the verry pain he was nygh wood
Almost he sweltid and swowned there he stood
When he saw her dance with a ring on her hand
So fressh she was and thereto so likand
And to his bed he went him hastily
No More of him at this time speak I
But there I let him weep ynogh and pleyne
Til fresh may wol rewe on his pain
O Perlous fire that in the bedstraw bredith
O familier foo that his service bedith
O servant treytour falls holy hew
Lyk to the adder sligh and in thy bosom untrue
God shilde us all from your acquaintance
O January dronken in pleysaunce
O marriage se how that thy Dannan
Thyn owen squier and thyn owen born man
Entendith for to do the a velonye
God grant the thyn harm to aspye
For in this world nys wors pestilence
Than an homly foo alday in thy presence
Parfourmyd has this day his arc diurne
No longer may the body of him seiourne
The orisont as in that latitude
Night with his mantel that is so derk and rude
Began forto sprede the emyspery about
For which departith is the lusty route
Fro January with thank on every side
Hoom to their housis lusty they ride
There as they do thingis as hem list
And when they se her time they go to rest
Sone aftir this hastily this January
Would go to bed he would no longer tarry
He drynkith Ipocraas clarrey and vernage
Of spi^is hoot to encrece his courage
And meny a lectuary had he full fyn
Such as the cursid monk dan Constantyn
Has written in his book of coytu
To ete hem all he would no thing escheu
And thus to his privy frendis said he
For goddis love as soon as it may be
Leet void all this house in curteys wise sone
Men dronken and the trauers drew an^ (...)
This brid was brought to bed as still^ as ston
So hastid January it most be don
And when the bed was with the pressed blissid
Out of the chambir has every wight him dressid
And January has fast in armies take
His fressh may his paradyse his make
He lulleth here and kisseth her full often
With the brustillis of his berd vnsofte
L^k to the skyn of a fissh sharp as brere
For he was shave al new in his manner
He rubbith her upon her tender face
And said thus allas I most trespace
To you my spouse and you greatly offend
Or time com that I will down descend
But natheles considerith this quod he
There is no workman what ever he be
That may both worche well and hastily
This would be do at leyser parfitly
It is no force how long that we pleye
I trow in wedlok couplid be we tweye
And I blissid be the yok that we been ynne
For in our actis we mow do no sin
A man may do no sin with his wife
Ne hurt him self with his owen knyf
Now have we leave to pleye us be the law
Thus labourith he til the day began dawe
And than he takith a sop in fyn clarre
And up right on his bed sittith he
And aftir that he sang full loud and clear
And kissith his wife and makith wanton chere
He was al coltissh and full of ragery
And full of Iargon as is a fleckid pie
The slak skyn about his neck shakith
While that he song so chauntid he and crakith
But god woot what may thought in her heart
When she him saw up sitting in his sherte
In his night cappe and with his neck lene
She preysith not his pleyynge worth a been
Than said he thus my restyng wol I take
Now day is come I may no longer wake
And down he leyde his head and slept til pryme
And aftir when that he saw his time
Up risith January and fresh may
She holdith her chamber til the fourth day
As usage is of wyuys for the best
For every labor sumtyme must have rest
Or ellis long may he not endure
This is to say no liuys creature
Be it ^ish or bryd best or man
Now wol I speak of this squire damyan
That langurith for love as ye shul here
Therefore I speak to him in this manner
I say o sely Damyan allas
Answer to this demand in this caas
How shall thou thy lady fressh may
Tell thy woo she wol alwey say nay
Eke if thou speak she will thy woe bewreyn
God be thy help I can no bettir seyn
This s^k Damyan in venus great fire
So brennyth that he dies for desir
For which he puttith his lif in adventure
No longer might he in this wise endure
But privily a penner began he borowe
And in a lectir wroot al his sorrow
In manner of a compleynt or a lay
Unto his fressh and fair lady May
And in a purs of silk hynge it on his shirt
He has y put and y leyd it at his heart
Thus has January wedd^d fressh may
And the moon as I understand that day
Out of taure was in the Cankir glidyn
So long has she in her chambir bidyn
As custom is unto these noblis all
A bride shall not etyn in the halle
Til days four or three at lest
Passid be than let her go to feste
The ferthe compleet fro noone to noone
When that the high mass was done
In halle sat this January and may
As fresh as is the bright someris day
And so be fyl that this good man
Rememb^ith him upon this damyan
And said saint mary how may this be
That Damyan entendith not to me
Is he ay sik or how may this betyde
His squiere which that stood him beside
Excusid him be cause of his sickness
Which lettith him to do his besinesse
Non other cause might make him care
That me forthinkith quod this Ianuare
He is a gentil squire be my truth
If that he deyde it were harm and routhe
He is wise discret honest and secre
As any man I woot of his degree
And thereto manly and seruysable
And forto be a thrifty man right abyl
But aftir mete as soon as ever I may
I will my self visit him and may
To do him all the comfort that I can
And for that word him blissid every man
That of his bounte and of his gentilnesse
He would so comfort him in sickness
His squier for it was a gentil deed
Dame quod this January take good ^ede
That aftir mete ye with your wom^en all
When ye have be in chamber out of this hall
That all ye go to se this damyan
To do him disport he is a gentilman
And tellith that I wol him visit
Have I no thing but restid me a lite
Now with this word he began to him call
A squier that was marchal of his halle
And told him certain thingis what he would
This fresh may has straight her wey hold
With all her women unto this damyan
Down be his bedside anon sat she than
Confortyng him as goodly as she may
This damyan when he his time say
In privy wise his purs and eke his bille
In which that he writyn had al his will
Has put in to her hand withouten more
Save that he sighed right wonderly sore
And softly to her right thus said he
Mercy and that ye discover not me
For I am ded if that this thing be kyd
This bille has she in her b^som hyd
And went her wey ye get no more of me
Unto January common then is she
And on his beddis side sat full soft
He takith her and kiss^th her full often
And leyd him down to sleep and that anon^
She feyned as that she must goone
There as ye woot every wight most need
And when she of this byl has take keep
She rent it unto cloutis and at last
In the privy softly has she it cast
Who studieth now but fair fresh may
And down be January she lay
That slepte til the cow has him wakid
Anon he preyde her to strype her nakid
He would of here he said have ^um plesaunce
He said her clothis does him cumbraunce
And she obeys be she leef or loath
But lest that precious folk with me be wroth
How that he wroughte y dar you not tell
Or whether he thought it paradyse or hell
But I let hem worche in her wise
Til euensong and that he must arise
Were it be destyne or be adventure
Were it be influence or be nature
Other in constillacion that in such astat
The heuyn stood that time fortunat
Was forto put a bil of venus werkis
For all thing has time as sayn clerkis
To any womman forto get her love
I can not sey but great god above
That knows non act is ca^selees
He demyth al for I wol hold my pees
But soth it is how that this fressh may
Has take such impression that day
Of pity of this sik man Damyan
That fro her heart she ne drive can
The remembrance forto do him ese
Certain though whom this thing displese
I here recke not I him assure
To love him best of any creature
Though he no more had than his shert
And all was pity and tender heart
Here may ye here how excellent fraunchyse
In women is when they hem narow auyse
Some tiraunt there is as there be many on
That has an heart as hard as any stoon
Which would have leet him sterue in the place
Well rather than have grauntid him grace
And hem reioysen in her cruel pride
And reckid not to be an homicide
This gentil may fulfilled of al pity
Right so of her hond a lec^ir made she
In which she grauntid of her verry grace
There lackith naught but only day and space
Where that she might to his lust suffyse
For it shall be right as he wol deuyse
And when she saw her time upon aday
To visit this damyan goth this fresh May
And subtly a lettir down she thriste
She takith him by the hond and hard him twiste
So secretly that noman it w^ste
And ^ad him be al hool and sorth she went
To January when he for her sent
Up risith damyan the next morrow
Al passid was his siknes and hissorow
He kembith him and proynyth him and pikith
He does all that his lady lust and likith
And eke to January he goth as low
As euyr deed a dog for the bow
He is so plesaunt to every man
For craft is al who so that it can
That every wight is feign to teache him good
And fully in his ladies grace he stood
Thus let I damyan about his need
And in my tale forth I wol proceed
Some clerkis holden that felicite
Hit stont in delit and therefore he
This nobil January with all his might
In honest wise as longs to a knight
Shoop him to live full deliciously
His howsing his array as honestly
To his degree was made as a kyngis
Among other of his honest thingis
He had a gardyn wallith al with ston
So feir a gardyn wot I nowher non
For out of doubt I verily suppose
That he that wroot the romaunce of the Rose
Ne could of it the beauty well deuyse
Ne priapus ne might not suffice
Though he be god of gardyns for to tell
The beauty of the gardyn and of the well
That stood under a laurel alwey grene
Full often time king pluto and his queen
Proserpina and al her feyrye
Disporten hem and make melodye
About that well and daunsed as men told
This nobyl knight this January the old
Such deynte has to walkyn and to pleye
That he wol suffer no wight to bear the key
Save he him self of the small wiket
He baar alwey of silver a cliket
With the which when he list vnshit
And when he would pay his wife his debt
In somer seson thither would he go
And May his wife and no wight but they two
Of thingis that were not do a bed
They in the gardeyn parf^urmed have and sped
And in this wise meny a merry day
Lyuen this January and fresh may
But wordly joy may not always endure
To January ne no wordly creature
O sodeyn hap o fortune variable
Lik unto the scorpioun vnstabil
That flaterst with thy head when thou will stinge
Thy tail is death through thyn enuenymynge
O brotel joy o thou sweet poysoun queynt
O thou monster that subtly can peynt
Thy gestis under h^we ^f steadfastness
That thou disceyuest both more and less
Why have thou January thus disceyued
And haddist him for thy friend resceyued
And now thou have beraft him both his yen
For sorrow of which he desirith d^en
Allas this January that is so fre
Amyd his lust and his prosperity
Is now woxen blind and al suddenly
His death therefore desirith he vttirly
And therewith all a feer of Ielosie
Lest that his wife shall fall in some folly
So brent his heart that he would fayn
That some man both him and here had sleyn
For never after his death ne his life
Ne would he that she were love ne wife
But ever live in clothis blake
Sool as the turtyl that has lost his make
But at last aftir amonthe or twey
His sorrow began to swage as I you sey
For he wiste it may non other be
He patiently took his aduers^te
Save out of doubt may he not forgon
That he ne was Ielous evermore in on
Which ielousye was so outrageous
That neither in halle ne in other house
He nolde suffer here for to ride ne go
Ne in non other place neuyr the mo
But if that he had hond on here alwey
For which full o^te wepith fresh may
That louyth Damyan so benignely
That she must other deye suddenly
Or ellis she must have him a^te lest
She waytith when her heart would to breast
Up on that other side this Damyan
Be common is the so^owfullist man
That ever was for neither night ne day
Ne might he speak aword with fresh may
As of his purpose of none such matter
But if that January must it here
That had an hond an ere euyr mo
And nathelees be writing to and fro
And privy signys wiste he what she meant
And she knew of the same his intent
O January what might the auaylle
Though thou mightist se as fer as ship does sail
For as good blind is disceyued to be
As to be disceyued when aman may se
Lo argus which that had an hundrid yen
For all that ever he could pour or pryen
Yet was he blent and I woot so be mo
That wenyn that it is nothing so
Pass ouyr is an ese I sey no more
This fressh may of which I spak of yore
In warm wex has printid this cliket
That January baar of the small wiket
Be which unto this gardyn often he went
And damyan that knew here intent
The cliket countirfetid privily
There is no more to sey but hastily
Some wonder be this cliket shall be tide
Which ye shall here if ye will abide
O nobyl Ouyde soth say thou god woot
What sleighte it is though it be long and hoot
That he nyl find it up in some manner
By pyramus and Tysbe may men here
Though they were kept streyt long ouyr al
They been accordid rownyng thorou awal
There is non could have found such a sleighte
But now to purpoos or that days.viij.
Were passid of the month of Iuyl be fyl
That January has caught so greet awyl
Thorough eggyng of his wife him forto pleye
In his gardyn and no wight but they tweye
That in a morrow unto this may said he
Rise up my wife my love my lady fre
The turtelis voys I herd my spouse sweet
The winter is goon with all his raynes wete
Com forth with thyn yen columbyne
Now fayrer been ^hy brestis than is wine
The gardyn is closid al about
Com forth my sweet spouse out of doubt
Thou have me woundid in mine heart wife
No spot in the saw I in all my life
Com forth and leet us take our d^sport
I care for the my wife and for my comfort
Such old lewd wordis used he
On Damyan a sign made she
That he should go beforn with his cliket
This Damyan has opened the wyket
And in he stert and sat in such manner
That no wight might it se ne here
And stille he sat under abush anon
This January so blind is as a stone
With may in his hond and no wight mo
In to this fresh gardyn is he go
And clappid to the wiket suddenly
Now wife quod he here been but ye and I
That art the creature that I b^st love
For by that lord that sit us all above
I had leuyr right now dye on a knyf
Than the offenden mine owen dear wife
For goddis sake think hou y the chees
Not for couetyse ne other good doutlees
But only for the love I had to the
And though that y be old and may not se
Be to me true and I wol tell the why
Certis three thingis should ye win there by
First love of crist and to your self honor
And al mine heritage both town and tour
I ye^e it you makith chartres as you list
This shall be do to morrow or the son rist
So wisly god my soul bring to blis
And I pray you of covenant ye me kis
And though I be ielous wite me naught
Ye be so deep pryntid in my thought
That when I consider your beauty
And therewith all the vnliklih^de of me
I may not certis though I should die
Forbere to been out of your company
For verry love this is withouten doubt
Now kis me wife and let us rome about
This fressh may when she the wordis herd
Benignely to January answerde
But first and forward she began to weep
I have quod she a soul forto keep
As well as ye and also mine honor
And of my wyfhode that tender flour
Which that I have assured in your hond
When that the Priest to you my body bond
Wherefore I wol answer in this manner
With the leave of you my lord so dear
I pray to god that if ye ever se that day
That I ne sterue as foul as womman may
If ever I do to my kyn that shame
Or ellis I empeyre so my name
That I be falls and if I do that lak
To strype me and put me in a sak
And in the next river do me drenche
I am a gentil womman and no wenche
Why speak ye thus but men be ever untrue
And wommen have repreef of you ay new
Ye can non other comynycacion I leave
But speak to us of untrust and us repr^ue
And with that word she saw where Damyan
Sat in a bush and knele he began
And with her fyngris signs made she
That Damyan should clymbe up on a tree
That charged was with fruit and up he went
For verily he knew al her intent
And every sign that she could make
Well bet than January her owen make
For in a lettir she had told him al
Of this matere how he wirche shall
And thus I let him sit in the piry
And January with May young and merry
BRight was the day and blew the firmament
Phoebus of gold / down his bemys has sent
To gladen every flour with his warmness
He was that time in geminis as y guess
But litil fro his declinacion
And cansere of Iouis exaltacion
And so it fill that in a bright morrow tide
That in the gardy on the ferthir side
Pluto that is king of the fairye
And many a lady in his company
Following his wife the queen Preserpina
Which that her rauyss^ed out of pina
Whilis that she gadrid flouris in a mede
In claudian ye may the stories read
How in his grisly carte he her fette
This king of feyre adoun him set
Up on a benche of tur^es fa^r and grene
And right anon said he thus to his queen
My wife quod he there may no wight say nay
The experience prouith it every day
The treson which that women to do men
Ten hundrid thousand tellyn I can
Ensamples and of your untruth and brotilnes
O Salamon richest of all riches
Fulfilled of sapien^e and of wordly glory
Well worthy be thy wordis in memory
To every wight that wit and reason can
Thus preysith he yet the bounte of man
Among a thousand men yet fond I one
But of all wymmen fond he neuyr non
Thus said the king tht so knowith your wickidnes
And also Thesus Sirak as I guess
Ne spekith of you but seldyn reverence
A wild fire and a corupt pestilence
So fall on your bodies yet to night
Ne se ye not this honorable knight
Be cause allas that he is blind and old
His owen man shall make him Cokeold
Lo where he sit the lechour in the tree
Now wol I grant of my mageste
Unto this old blind worthy knight
That he shall have again his sight
When that his wife would do him vilonye
Than shall he know al her harlotry
Both in repreef of here and other mo
Ye shall quod preserpina and wol ye so
Now be my modris s^ris soul I swear
That she shall redily excusen her
And all wom^en after for her sake
Though they be in any gilty take
With face bold they shall hem self excuse
And bear hem down that would hem accuse
For lak of answer non of hem shul dyen
Al had he seen a thing with both his yen
Yet shul we so visage it hardely
And weep and swear and chyde subtly
That ye shul be as lewd as feel gees
That reckith not of here auctoritees
I woot well this though this Salamon
Fond of us women mo foolis than on
But though he ne fond no good woman
I pray you take the sentence of the man
He meant thus that in souereyn bounte
Nys non but god that sittith in tryynte
Ey for very god that nys but on
What make ye so much of Salamon
What though he made a tempyl goddis house
What though he were rich and glorious
So made he eke a tempyl of false goddis
How might he do a thing that more bad is
Parde as fair as ye his name enplastre
He was a lechour and eke an ydolaster
And in his elde he verry god forsook
And if god ne had as says the book
Asparyd for his fadris sake he should
Have lost his regne rathir than he would
I give right naught of all the velonye
That he of women writith a butter fly
I am a woman nedis y must speak
Or ellis swelle til mine heart to break
For sithen ye sey that we be Iangeleressis
As ever hool I moot broke my tressis
I shall not spare now for no courtesy
To speak him harm that would us velonye
Dame quod this Pluto be no longer wro^h
I give it up but since I sweer mine oath
That I will grant him his sight again
My word shall stand I say you certain
I am a king it sit me not to lie
And I a queen quod she of the feirye
Her answer shall she have I undertake
Let us nomo wordis here of make
For soth I wol you no longer tarry
Now let us turn again to January
That in the gardyn with his fresh may
Syngith full merier than the Popingeay
You love y best and shall and other non
So long about the aleyys is he goon
Till he was come ayens that pery
Where as this damyan sittith full merry
An high among the fresh leuys grene
This fresh may that is so bright and shene
Began forto sighe and said allas my side
Now sire quod she for aught that may betyde
I must have of the peris that I se
Or y must dye so sore longith me
To ete of the small peris grene
Help for his love that is of heaven queen
I tell you well a womman in my plit
May have in fruit so great an appetit
That she may dien but she of it have
Allas quod he that I ne had here a knave
That could clymbe allas quod he
That I am blind ye sire no force quod she
But would ye vouchesauf for goddis sake
The pery with ynne your armies forto take
For well I woot that ye mystruste me
Than should I clymbe well enough quod she
So I my feet might set up on your bak
Certis quod he thereof shall be no lak
Might I you helpyn with mine heart blood
He stoupith adoun and on his bak she stood
And caughte her be a twiste and up she goth
Ladies I pray you be not wroth
I can not gloss I am a rude man
And suddenly anon this damyan
Began pulle up the smok and in he throug
A greet tente a thrifty and a long
She said it was the meriest fytte
That ever in her lif she was at yet
My lordis tente seruith me nothing thus
He foldith twifolde be sweet Ihesus
He may not swyue worth a leek
And yet he is full gentil and full meek
This is leuyr to me than an euynsong
And when that Pluto saw that wrong
To January yaf ayeen his sight
And made him se as well as euyr he might
And when that he had caught his sight again
Ne was there noman of thing so fayn
But on his wife his thought was euyr mo
Up to the tree he cast his yen two
And saw how damyan his wife has dressid
^n such manner as it may not be expressid
But if I would speak vncurteisly
And up he yaf a roringe and a cry
As does the mother when the child shall die
Out help allas harow he began cry
For sorrow almost he began to die
That his wife was swyuyd in the Pery
O strong lady hoar what do thou
And she answerde sire what eylith you
Have patience and reason in your mind
I have you holpyn on both your yen blind
Up peril of my soul y shall not lain
As me was taught to hele with your yen
Was no thing bet to make you to se
Than forto strogil with aman in a tree
Good woot y deed it in full good intent
Strogil quod he ye algate in it went
Stif and round as any belle
It was no wonder though her belly swelle
The smok on his breast lay so theche
And ever me thought he poyntid on the brech^
God you give both a shamys death to dyen
He did the so I saw it with mine yen
And ellis I behangid be the hals
Than is quod she my medicine falls
For certainly if ye might se
Ye would not sey these words to me
Ye have some glymsinge and no parfit sight
I se quod he as well as ever I might
Thankid be god with both mine yen two
And be my trowthe me thought he did so
Ye may deem as ye list good sere quod she
This thank have I for I made you se
Allas quod she that euyr I was so kind
Now dame quod he lat al pass out of mind
Comdoun my leef and if I have myssayde
God help me so as y am evil a paid
But be my fader soul I went have seyn
How that this Damyan had by the leyn
And that thy smok he leyde up on thy breast
Ye sire quod she ye may wene as ye l^st
But sire quoth she aman that wakith of his sleep
He may not so suddenly well take keep
Up on a thing ne se it so parfitly
T^l that he be well adaw^d verily
Right so aman that long blind has be
Ne may not suddenly so sone well se
First when his sight is new common again
As he that has a day or tweyne y seyn
Til that your sight y fa^elid be awhyle
Th^r may full many a sight you begile
Bewar I pray you for be h^uyn king
Full meny a man wenyth to se a thing
And yet it is al another than it semyth
He that mysconce^ueth often mys demyth
And with that word she lepte fro the tree
This January who is glad but he
He kisseth her and clipp^th her full often
And on her womb he strikith her full soft
And to the Paleys hoom he has her lad
Now good men I pray you be merry and glad
Thus endith here my tale of January
God bliss us all and his mother Mary
Here endith the Marchan^tis tale. And begins the prolog of the wife of Bathe.
EXperience though non auctorite
Were in this world is right ynow for me
To speak of woo that is in marriage
But lordis syn y.xij. winter was of age
Thankid be god that is eternal alive
Husbondis at the church door have I had five
If I so often might have weddid be
And all were worthy men in here degree
But onys me was told not long a go I wys
That crist went neuyr but onys
To wedding in the Cane of galilee
That be the same ensaumpyl taught he me
That I weddid should be but onys
Lo which a sharp word for the nonys
Beside awelle Ihe^us god and man
Spak in repreef of the samaritan
Thou have had.v. husbondis said he
And that ilke man that now has the
Is not thy husbond thus he said certain
What he mente thereby I can not sayn
But that I ask why that the.v. man
Was not husbond to the samaritan
How many might he have in marriage
But herd y never tellyn in mine age
Of this noumbre very diffinicion
Men ^owe deem and gloss up a down
Well I woot express withoutyn lie
That god bad us w^xe and multiplye
That gentil text can I well understand
For well y woot that mine husbonde
Should leave fader and mother and take to me
But of noumbre no mention ma^e he
Of bigamye or of Octogamye
Why should men speak of it velonye
^o here the wise king Salamon
I trow he had wives mo than on
As would to g^d it leefful were to me
To have refresshing half so often as he
Which a yef^e of god had he for all his wyuy^
Noman has such^ that now on live is
God woot this nobyl king as to my wit
The first night had meny a merry fytte
With each of hem so well was him on live
Blissid be god for I have had five
Of which I have pikid out of the best
Both of her nethir end and eke her cheste
Diverse scolis makith diverse clerkis
And diu^rs practik in many sundry werkis
Makith the parfiter man to be sikerly
Of five husbondis scoling am I
Well come the sixte when that ^uer he shall
I wol him not forsake no thing at al
When mine husbond is fro the world I gone
Some christian man shall wedden me anon
For the apostel says that I am fre
To wedde a goddis half where it likith me
He says to be weddid it is no sin
Bettir it is to beweddid than to blynne
What reckith me though men say vilonye
Of shrewde lameth and of his bigamye
I woot abraham was a full holy man
And eke Jacob as fer as ever I here can
And each of them had mo wyuys than two
And meny another man also
Where can ye say in any manner age
That ever god defendid marriage
Be express wordis I pray you tell me
Or where comandid he euyr virginite
I woot as well as ye it is no dread
The apostil when he spak of maiden head
He said that there of precept had he noon
Men may counsel awomman to be oon
But counsel is no manner com^andement
He puttith that in our Judgment
For had god commanded maydenhede
Than had he dampened wedding out of dread
And certis if there were no seed I sow
Virginite what should thereof grow
Paul durst not comaunde act lest
A thing which his master yaf non heste
The dart is set up on virginite
Cast who so may who rennyth best let se
But this word is not take of every wight
But there as god wol give it of his might
I woot well the apostel was amayde
But natheles though he wroot and said
He would well every wight were as he
Al is but counsel to virginite
And forto be a wife he yaf me leave
Of indulgence so it be not to repreue
To wedde me if that my make dye
Without excepcioun of bigamye
Al were it good no woman forto towche
He mente in his bed or in his cowche
For paril it is fire and tow to assembil
Ye know what this ensample may resemble
This is al and some he held virginite
More parfit than wedding in freelte
Freelte clepe I but if he or she
Would ledyn her life in chastity
I grant it weel I have non envy
Though maydenhede prefer bigamy
It likith hem to be cleen in body and ghost
Of mine estate I will make no bost
Full well I know a lord in his hushold
Has meny a vessel of silver and of gold
Some been of tree and don her lord seruise
God clepith to him folk in sundry wise
And each has of god a proper yeste
Each man as him list to shifte
Virginite is a greet perfection
And continence eek with devotion
But crist that is of perfection the well
Bad not every wight he should go selle
All that he has and give it to the pour
And in such wise follow him and his lore
He spak to hem that will live parfitly
And lordingis be your leave that am not I
I wol bestow the flour of al mine age
In the actis and in the fruit of marriage
Tell me also to what conclusion
Were membris maad of generation
And of so parfit wise a wight y wrought
Trust me well they be not made for naught
Gloss who so wol and sey up an down
They were made for purgacion
Of vryne and of other thingis small
Was eke to know a female from amale
And for no cause ellis say ye no
The experience woot well it is not so
So that ye clerkis with me be not wroth
I say thus they be made for both
That is to say both for office and for ese
Of engendernre there we god not displese
Why should not ellis men in bokis set
That man shall yield to his wife her debt
Where with should he make his payement
If he ne vsid his sely instrument
Then were they maa^ upon a creature
To purge him and eke to engendrur^
But I say not this as y you told
That every wight that has such harneis is hold
To go and use hem in engendrure
Than should men of chastity take no cure
Crist was a maid and shapyn as a man
And many an holy saint since the wor^de began
Ye l^uyd they ever in parfit chastity
But I nyl envy non virginite
Leet hem with bred of pured whete befed
And let us vsen hoot harly bred
And yet with harly ^^ed men tell can
Our (...) Ihesus refresshid many a man
In swhich astat as god has clepid us
I will persevere I am not precious
In wife hood will I use mine instrument
As freely as my maker has it sent
If I be dangerous god give me sorrow
Whether he will at eve or a morrow
When that him list com forth and pay his debt
An husbond wol y have y wol not let
That shall be both my dettour and my thral
And I his tribulacion with all
Duringe the while that I am his wife
The power wol I have during al my lif
Both of his propir body and not he
Right thus the apostel told it me
And bad our husbondis forto love us weel
All this sentence me likes eueridel
Up stert the pardoner and that anon
Now dame quod he be god and be saint John
Ye be an nobyl prechour in this caas
I was about to wedde awyf alas
What should I bye it my self so dear
Yet had y lever wedde no wife this year
Abide quod she my tale is not begone
Nay thou shall drink of another tonne
Or that I go shall savor worse than ale
And when I have told forth my tale
Of tribulacion that is in marriage
Of which I am expert in all mine age
This is to sey my self have be the whipp^
Than may thou chese whither thou will sippe
Of that tonne that y shall broche
Be ware of it or thou to nygh approach
For I shall tell ensamplis mo than ten
Who so wol not be waar be other men
Be him shall other men correctid be
These same wordis writith ptholome
Reed in his almegeste and take it there
Dame I will pray you if your will were
Said this pardoner as ye began
Tell forth your ^ale spare for noman
And teache us young men of your practike
Gladly quod she since it may you like
But that y pray to all this company
If that y speak aftir my fantesye
As take not a greef of that I say
For mine intent is but forto play
Now seris than wol y tell you forth my tale
As euyr I must drink wine or ale
I shall say soth these husbondis that I had
Three of hem were good and two were badde
Uneath might they hold the statute
In which they were bonden unto me
Ye woot weel what I mean parde
As help me god y laughe what thet I think
How petously a night y made hem to swynke
And be my faith I yaf of hem no stoore
They had me give her land and her tresor
Me nedith not to do hem longer diligence
To win her love or do hem reverence
They l^ued me so well be god above
That I ne told no deynte of her love
A wise woman will besy her euyr in one
To get her love there she has noon
But since I had hem holly in mine hond
And aftir they had give me here land
What should y take keep hem forto plese
But if it were for my pr^fit or for mine ease
I held hem so a work be my fey
That many a night they song well awey
The bacon was fet for hem I trow
That some man has in essex at donmow
I governed hem so well aftir my law
That each of hem full blesful was and fawe
To bring me feire thingis fro the feyre
They were full feyn when I spak to hem fair
For god it woot I chidde hem spitously
Now herke how I baar me properly
Ye wise wives that can understand
Thus should ye spekyn and bear hem an hand
For half so boldly can there noman
Swear and lie as a woman can
I say not this but ye wives that been wise
But if it be when they hem mys auyse
A wife if that she can her good
Shall bear him on hond the cow is wood
And take witness of her owen maid
Of here assent but herkenyth how I said
Sire old kaynard is this thyn array
Why is mine neyghebours wife so gay
She is honourith where ever she goth
I sit at hoom and have no thrifty cloth
What do thou at mine neyghebours house
Is she so fair art thou so amerous
What rownest thou with a maid benedicite
Sire old lechour let thy Iapis be
And if that I have a gossib or a friend
With outyn gilt thou chidist as a fend
If that thou walkist hoom to her house
Thou comyst hoom as drunk as a mous
Thou prechist on thy benche with evil preef
Thou say to me it is a great myschief
To wedde a pour woman for costage
And if she be high and of rich parage
Thou say that it is a very turmentry
To suffer her pride and her malencoly
And if she be fair thou verry knave
Thou say that every harlot wol her have
She may no while in chastity abide
That is assaylid on every side
Thou s^yst some folk desire us for riches
Some for our shap and some for our fairnes
And some for she can other singe or dance
And some for gentilnes or for daliaunce
Some for her hondis and legs small
Thus goth al to the devil ^e thy tale
Thou say men may keep a castle wall
It may so long assaylid be ouyr al
And if she be foul thou say that she
Coueytith every man that she may se
For as a spaynel she wol on him lepe
Til she may f^nde some man her to chepe
Ne non so gray goos goth there in the lake
As say thou be will without her make
And say it is an hard thing forto welde
A thing that noman wol his thank held
Thus say thou lorel when thou ghost to bed
And that no wise man nedith forto wedde
Ne noman that entendith unto heuyn
With wild thund^r dynt and fire leuyn
I pray god moot thyn neck al to break
Tho say a dropping house and eek smeke
And chidyng wyuys maken men to flee
Out of her howsis atonys a benedicite
What eylith such an old man forto chyde
Thou say we wyuys will our vicis hyde
Til we be fast and than we will hem show
Well may that be a proverb of a shrewe
Thou say that men assis horse and houndis
They been assayd of diverse stoundis
Basyns lauours or that men hem bye
Sponys stolis and all other husbondrye

But folk of wyuys make non assay
Til they be weddid to old dotard shrewis
And than say thou well our vicis shewis
Thou say also that it displesith me
But if thou wolt preyse my beauty
And but thou pour alday in my face
And clepe me fair dame in every place
And but thou make a feste that ilke day
That y was born and me ^resh and gay
And but thou do me norish and honor
And to my chamber with in my ^oure
And to my fadris folk and mine alies
Thus say thou old chorle full of lies
And also for that our prentice Iankyn
For his crisp heris shynynge as gold fyn
And for he squireth me both up and down
Yet have thou caught a falls suspecion
I will him not though thou were ded to morrow
But tell me this why hidist thou with sorrow
The keys of thy cheste awey fro me
As well it is my good as thyn parde
What wenyst thou to make an idiot of our dame
Now be that lord that clepid is saint Iame
Thou shall not both though thou were wood
Be master of my body and of my good
That on thou shall forgo magre thyn yen
What nedith it of me to enquere or pryen
I trow thou woldist lokke me in thy cheste
Thou sholdist say good wife go where ye list

Of all men his wisdom it is the best
That reckith not who has the world in hand

Have ye enough what dar ye recke or care
How merrily that other folkis fare
For certis old dotardis be your leave
Ye shall have queynte enough at eve
Be thou neuyr wroth for mine instrument
Though it be sometime to a good felaw lent
For he is to great an nygard that will werne
A man to light a candel at his lantern

With clothing or with precious array
That it is peril of our chastity
And with sorrow thou most enforcen the
And say these wordis in the Apostelis name
In habit made with chastity and shame
Ye women shul appareylle you quod he
And not in tressid here and rich perre

Thou say thus I walk out as a cat
But who so wol senge the cattis skyn
Than will the cat duelle in his in
And if the cattis skyn be slight and gay
She wol not duelle in his house half aday
But forth she wol or any day bedawed
To show her skyn and go a catirwaw^d
This is to say if I begay sir shrewe

Sire old fool what helpith the to espien
Though thou pleye argus with his hundrid yen
To be my ward corpse as he may best
In feith he shall not kept me but me ^est
Yet could I make his berd so mote I the
Thou say eek that there be thingis three
The which thingis troublen all the earth
And that no wight may endure the ferthe
O leave sire shrewe Ihesus short thy lif
Yet prechist thou and say an hateful wife
Rekenyd is for on of these myschaunsi^s
Ben there now none other resemblaunsis
That may be like your parablis unto
But if a sely wife be on of tho
Thou liknest eke a womannys love to hell
To bareyn land there watir may not dwell
Thou liknest us eek also to wild fire
The more it brennyth the more it has desire
To consume every thing that brent would be
Thou say right as wormys shendyn a tree
Right so a wife destroieth her husbonde
This known they that been to wyuys bond
Lordingis right thus as ye have understand
Bare y stiffly mine old husbondis on hand
And of other things both more and less
And al was falls but as I took witness
Of Iankyn our child and of mine nece also
O lord the pyne I deed hem and the woo
Full giltlees often be goddis sweet pyne
For as an horse I could both byte and whyne
I could pleyne though I were in the gilt
Or ellis I had often times be spilt
Who so comyth first to the mylle first he grynt
I pleyned first so were our werrys stynt
They were full glad for to excuse hem blyue
Of thing which they never agiltid her live
Of wenchis would I bear hem full sore on hond
When that for sike uneath might they stand
Yet tiklid I his heart for that he
Wend that I of him had so great cheerte
I swoor that al my walkyng out be night
Was for to spy wenchis that he dight
Under that color had I meny a myrthe
For all ^uche thing was give us in our birthe
Disceyt weeping spynnynge god has give
To women kyndely while that they live
And thus of o thing I may auaunte me
At end I had the bettir in each degree
Be sleyghte or force or by some manner thing
Or by continuel murmur or grucchinge
Namely a bed had they myschaunce
There would I chide and do hem no plesaunce
I would no longer there abedde abide
If that I felt his arm over my side
Til he had maad his raunson unto me
Than would I suffer him do his nycete
And therefore every man this tale I tell
Wyn who so may for all is forto selle
With empty hondis men may no hawkis li^e
For winning would I as his list endure
And make me then a feyned appetit
And yet in bacon had y never delit
That made m^ that ever I would hem chyde
For though the Pope had sitten hem beside
I would not spare hem at her owen board
For be my truth I quytte hem every word
As so help me god omnipotent
Though right now I should make my testament
I owe hem not o word but that it is quyt
I brought it so about by my wit
That they must give it up al for the best
Or ellis had we never be in rest
For though he lokid as wild as a lion
Yet should he fail of his conclusion
Than would I say good leef take keep
How mekely lokith wilkyn our sheep
Ye should be al pacient and meke
Com n^r my spouse let me ba thy cheke
And have a sweet spicid concience
Since ye so speak of iobbis patience
Suffrith always syn ye can so well preche
And but ye do certain we wol you teache
It is fe^r aman to have his wife in pees
On of us two must bow doutlees
And since a man is ever more reasonable
Then a woman is ye most be sufferabil
What eylith you to gruoche and groan
It is for ye would have my queynte a lone
Why take it lo have it euerydeel
Petir I shrewe you but ye love it weel
For if I would selle my bele chose
I could walk as fressh as a rose
But I wol keep it for your owen toth
Ye be to blame be god I say you soth
Such manner wordis had we on hand
Now wol I speak of my first husbonde
My first husbond was a reuelour
Tys is to say he had aparamour
And I was young and full of ragery
Stoborn and strong and pliant as a pie
Welcoude he dance and harp small
And sing as merry as any nychtyngale
When I had drunk adranghte of sweet wyn
Metnllms the foul chorle the swyne
That with a staf berafte his wif har lif
For she drank wine and I had be his wif
He should not have dauntid me so fro drink
And after wine ou venus must I think
For also sikir as cold eugendrith hail
A licorous month must have a licorons tail
In vynolent person is no defense
This known lechours be experience
But lord crist when it remembrith me
Upon my youth and on my Iolite
It tiklith so upon my heart rote
Unto thysday it does my heart bote
That I have had my world and my time
But age allas that al wol enuenyme
Has me berafte my beauty and my pith
Let go fare weel the devil go perwith
The flour is go ^her is no more to tell
The bren as I best may now must I selle
Now to beright merry now will I fond
Now will I tell of my fourth husbonde
I Sey he had in his heart a great despyt^
That I any other had delyt
But he was quyt be god and be saint Iose
I made him of the same wode a croce
Not of my body in no foul manner
That certainly I made folk such chere
That in his owen greece I made him frye
For angir and for verry Ielousye
Be god in earth I was his verry purgatory
For which I hope his soul be in glory
For god it woot he sat full often and song
When that his sho bittirly him wrong
Th^r was no w^ght save god and he that wyste
In many wise how sore I did him twiste
He deyde when I com fro Iherusalem
And lith I graued under the rode beem
Al is not his toumbe so curious
As was the sepulcre of him Darius
Which that appelles wroughte subtly
It is but wast to birye him preciously
Let him fare well god give his soul good rest
He is now in his grane and leyd in his cheste
Now of my fyfthe husbonde wol I tell
God let her soulis never come in hell
And yet was the fyfthe to me the most shrewe
That feel I on my ri^bis re^w^ by rewe
And ever shall unto mine endyng day
But in ^ur b^d he was full fresh and gay
And therewith al also he could so well gloss
That though he had beat me on every boon
He could win my love ayeen anoon
I trow I loved him best for that he
Was of his love so dangerous unto me
We wymmen have if that I shall not lie
In this matter a queynte fantesye
Wait what thing we may not lightly have
There aftir will we cry alday and crave
Forbede us thing and that desiren we
Preese on us and than will we sle
With danger utter we al our chaffare
Greet prees at market makith dear ware
And to greet cheep is holdyn a febyl price
This knows every woman that is wise
MY fyfthe husbonde god his soul bless
Wichiche I took for love and no richesse
He sumtyme was a clerk of Oxenforde
And had left scole and went at hoom to berde
With my gossib tho duellinge in our town
God have her soul her name was alisoun
She knew my heart and eek my pryuyte
Bettir than our parish pressed so mot I the
To here bewreyed I my counsel al
For had mine husbond pissid ayens a wall
Or do a thing that he should have lost his lyff
To her ^^nd also to another wyff
When that he would have my bele chose
And to my Nece which that I loved weel
I would have told his counsel euerydell
and so I did full often god it woot
That made his face full often reed and hoot
For v^rry shame and blamed him self that he
Had told to me so great a priuyte
And so be fyl that onys in a lent
So often time I to my gossib went
For ever I loved to be gay alleway
And forto walk in March aperyl and May
Fro house to house to here sundry talis
That Iankyn clerk and my gossib dame alis
And I my self in to the feldis went
My husbond was at london all that lent
I had the bettir leyser forto pleye
And forto se and eke forto be seye
Of lust^ folk what wiste I where my grace
Was shapyn forto be or in what place
Therefore I made my visitacions
To vigilis and to processions
To prechinge eke and to pilgremagis
To pleyis of myraclis and to mariagis
And w^rid up on my gay scarlet gites
These wormys ne these mowthis ne these mytis
Upon my parel frayde hem never adeel
And wost thou why for they were used well
Now wol I tell forth what happid me
I say that in the feldis walkid we
Til truly that we had such daliaunce
This clerk and I what of my purueaunce
I spak to him and said how that he
If I were widow he should wedde me
For certain I say you for no bobance
Yet was I never without purueaunce
Of marriage ne of other thingis eek
I hold a mons heart not worth a leek
That has but on hool to sterte to
And if that fail than is al I do
I bare him on hond / he had enchauntid me
My dame taught me forsooth that sotil^e
And eke I said y met of him al night
He would a shamed me as I lay up right
And al my bed was full of very blood
But yet I hope truly ye shul do me good
For blood betokenyth gold / as I was taught
And alwas falls I dremed of him right naught
But as I folowid ay my damys lore
As well of that as of other thingis more
And now sire let se what should y sayn
A ha by god I have my tale again
When that my fourth husbond was on beer
I wept algate and made a sorry chere
As wyuys motyn for it is the usage
And with my kercher I clerid my visage
But for that I was purueyed of a make
I wept full lityl I dar undertake
To church was my husbond born^ on morrow
With neighbors that for him made sorrow
And Iankyn our clerk was on of tho
As help me god when I saw him go
Aftir the beer me thought he had a peyre
Of leggis and feet so clean and so feyre
That al my heart I yaf unto his hold
He was I trow twenty winter old
But I was.xl. if I shall sey the soth
But yet I had alwey a coltis toth
Gappe tothid y was but that be came me weel
I had the prynt of saint venus fell
As help god I was a full lusty on
And feir and rich and young and well begoon
And trewly as my husbondis told me
I had the best queynte that might be
For certis I am al fully venerian
In felinge and my heart is Marcian
Venus me yaf my lust and likerousnesse
And Marce yaf me my sturdy hardynesse
Mine ascendaunt was taure and mars there in
Allas allas that ever love was sin
In following ay mine inclinacion
Be virtue of my constillacion
That made me that I could not withdraw
My chambr^ of venus fro a good felaw
Yet have I a mark of Mars up on my face
And also in another privy place
For god so wisl^ be my sauacion
I louyd never be non discress^on
But ever folowid mine appetit
Al were he long short black or whit
I took no keep so that he liked me
How pour he was ne eke of what degree
What should y say but at the monthis end^
This ioly clerk Iankyn that was so hende
Has weddid me with great solempnyte
And to him yaf I both land and fee
That ever was give me therbefore
But aftirward me repentid it full sore
He nolde suffer no thing of my list
Be god he smoot me onys with his fist
On the cheke for y rent out of his book aleef
That of the struck mine ere w^xt al deef
Stiborne I was as is a lioness
And of my tunge a very Iangelresse
And walk I would as I done had beforn^
Fro house to house al though he had ysworn^
For which he often time would preche
And me of old romaunce talis teache
How he simplicines gallus left his wife
And he forsook her term of al his life
Not but for ones opyn he her say
Lokyng out of his door up on aday
Anothir wife told he me be name
But for his wife was at a someris game
Without his wyting he forsook her eek
And than would he up on his bible seek
That ilke proverb of Ecclesiast
Where he comaundith and biddith fast
Men shall not suffer her wyuys to royle about
Than would he say thus withouten doubt
Who so bildith his house al of salowis
And pryke his blind horse over the falowis
And suffrith his wife to seek halowis
He is worthy to be hongid on the galowis
But al for naught I set not an hawe
Of all his prouerbis ne of al his old saw
Ne I would not of him correctid be
I hate him that tellith his vicis unto me
And so do mo god woot of us than I
This made him wood with me al vttirly
I would not forbere him in no caas
Now wol I say soth be saint Thomas
Wh^ that I rent out of his book a l^ef
For which h^ smot me so that I was deef
He had a book that gladly both night and day
For his disport he would read always
He cl^pid it Valery and Theophraste
At which b^ok he lough alwey fast
And eke therwas a clerk some time in rome
A Cardinal that highte saint Jerome
That made a book aga^n Ionyn^an
In which book therwas e^k tort^lan
Crisippus Tortula and belowis
That was Abbess not fer fro Paris
And parabolis of wise Salamon
Ouydes art and eek bokis many on
And all these were bounden in on volume
And every day and night was his custume
When he had leyser and any vacacion
Fro al other wordly occupacion
To redyn on this book of wickid wyuys
He knew of hem mo legendis and liuys
Than be of good wyuys in the bible
For trustith well it is an impossible
That any clerk wol speak good of wyuys
But if it be of holy fayntis lyuys
Ne of non other woman never the mo
Who peyntyd the lyoun tell me who
Begod if women had wrytyn storiys
As clerkis have in her Oratorijs
They would have written of men more wickidnes
Than all the mark of Adam may redress
The childryn of Mercury and venus
Been in her workyng full contrarious
Mercuri louith wisdom and science
And venus louith riot and dispense
And for her diverse disposicion
Each fallyth in othris exaltacion
That thus god woot Mercury is dissolate
In pisces when venus is exaltate
And venus fallith there Mercury is reysid
Therefore women of no clerk is preysid
The clerk when he is old and may naught do
Of venus workis not worth his old sho
Than sittith he down and writith in his dotage
That women can not keep her marriage
But now to purpos why I told the
That I was betyn for a book parde
Up on a night Ianstyn that was our sire
Radde on his book as he sat be the fire
Of Eve first that for her wickedness
Was al mankind brought to wrecchidnes
For which that Ihesu crist him self was slain
That boughte us with his heart blood again
Lo here expres of women may ye find
That woman was the los of al mankind
To read he me how Sampson lost his heris
Slepinge his lemman kit hem with her sheris
Thorough which treson lost he both his yen
Tho radde he if that I shall not lain
Of H^rcules and of Dyanyre
That causith him to set him self a fire
No thing forgot he the sorrow and the woo
That Socrates had with his wyuys two
How Exantippa cast piss up on his head
This sely man sat stille as he were ded
He wipid his head n^ word durst he sayn
But or the thunder stynte comyth rayn
Of Philip that was the queen of Crete
For shrewdness him toughte it sweet
Fie spek no more it is a grisly thing
Of her horrible lust and of her likyng
Of Cletemystra for her high lecherye
That fasly made her husbond to dye
He read it with full good devotion
He told me eke for what conclusion
Amphioraxe at Thebes lost his lif
Mine husbonde had a legende of his wife
Eriphiden that for an ouche of gold
Has privily unto the grekis told
Where that her husbonde hid him in a place
For which he had at thebes a s^ri grace
Of lima told he me and of lucy
They both made her husbondis forto die
That one for love that other was for hate
Lyma her husbonde upon an even late
Enpoysond him for sche was his ^o
Lucia likerons loved her husbond so
For he should algatis ou here think
She yaf unto him such aloue drink
That he was ded or it was at morrow
And thus algate husbondis had sorrow
Thanne told he me how that lacyuius
Compleyned how that fell man arrius
That in his gardyn growde such a tree
On which he said how that his wyuis three
Hanged hem selff for her hertis despitons
O leave brothir said than this arrius
Zif me a plant of that blissed tree
And in mine gardyn plantid shall it be
Of latter date of wyuis has he red
That some have sleyn her husbondis abed
And leet her lechour swyue hem all the night
Whilis that the corpse lay in floor upright
And some have drive nailis in her brayn
Whilis that they slepte and thus they have hem slain
Some have give hem poison in her drink
He spak more harm than heart may think
And th^rwith al he could mo prouerbis
Than in this world grow gras or herbis
Bettir is quod he thyn habitacion
Be with a lioun or with a dragon
Than with a woman using forto chyde
Be^tir is quod he high in his roof abide
Than with an angry wife duellinge in his house
They be so wickid and so contrarious
They haten that her husbondis love ay
H^ said a woman cast her shame away
When she cast of her smok and ferther mo
A fair woman but she be chaste also
Is lik a goldryng on a sowys nose
Who would leave or who would suppose
The woe that in mine heart was and pyne
And when I saw that he would never fine
To redyn on his cursid book alnyght
Al suddenly three leuys have I plight
Out of his book right as he read and eek
I with my fist so took him on the cheek
That in our fire he fyl bacward a down
And he up stert as does awood lioun
And with his fist he smot me on the head
That in the flore I lay as I had be ded
And when he saw how stylle that I lay
He was aghast and would have fled away
Til at last I out of my swowne abreid
O have thou slain me falls thief I seid
And for my land thus have thou murdered me
Or I be ded zit wol I onys kiss the
And near he came and knelid fair adoun
And said dear fuster sweet alisoun
As help me god I shall the neuir smite
That y have do it is thy self to wite
Foryeue it me and that I the beseke
And zit eft sonys I hitte him on the cheke
And said thief thus much I am be wreke
Now wol I die I may no longer speak
But at last with much care and woo
We fill accordid be our selfyn two
He yaf me the bridil in my hond
To have the governance of hons and land
And a^tir of his tunge and of his hond also
And made him brenne his book anon to
And thanne when I had gotyn unto me
The maistrie and eek the souereynte
And thanne he said mine owen true wif
Does as you list all the term of your life
Keep thin honor and eke mine astate
And after that day we had never debaat
God help me so I was to him as kind
As any wyff fro denmark in to ynde
And also true and so was he to me
I pray to god yat sittith in mageste
So bliss his sonle for his mercy dear
Now wol I say my tale if ye wol here
THe friar lowgh when he had herd all this
Now dame quod he so have I joy and blis
This is a long preambil of a tale
And when the sompnour herd the friar gale
Lo quod the Sompnour for gods armies two
A friar wol entremete him euermo
Lo good men a fly and eek a friar
Wol fall in every mannys dissh and matere
What spekist thou of preambulacion
What ambyl or trot go pysse or sit a down
Thou lettyst our disport in this matere
Ye wolt thou so sir Sompnour quod the friar
Now be my feith I shall or that I go
Tell of a Sompnour such a tale or two
That all folk shall lawghe in this place
Now ellis friar y be shrewe thy face
Quod this sompnour and I beshrewe me
But if I tell ta^is two or three
Of ^reris or that I come to Sidyngbourne
That I shall make the forto morn
For well y woot thy patience is goon
Our o^te cryde pees and that anon
And said let the woman tell her tale
Ye faren as folk that drunk been of ale
Good dame tell forth your tale and that is best
Al ready sy^e quod she right as you list
If I have license of this worthy friar
Yes dame quod he tell forth and I wol here
Here endith the wyff of Bathes prologe. And here begynnyth her tale.
IN old days of king Artur
Of which britous spekith great honor
Al was this land fulfilled of fayrye
The elf queen with her ioly company
Daunced full often in meny a grieve mede
This was the old oppinion as I read
I speak of many an hundrid yeris a goo
But now can noman se elphis mo
For now the great charity and prayers
Of limytours and eke of other freris
That serchen every land and every streme
As thick as motis in the son beem
Blissinge hallis chambris kechens and bowris
Citees Burghis castellis and eek touris
Shoppis bernys Shepens and deyries
This makith that there be no feyries
For there as wont was to walk an elf
There walkith now the limytour him self
I^ vndermelis and in mornyngis
And seith his matyns and his thingis
As he goth forth in his limytacion
A woman may go sauely up and down
Under every bussh or under every tree
There is none other incubus but he
And he ne would do hem any dishonor
And so befil that this king Artour
Had in his house a lusty bacheler
That on a day com ridynge from the ryuere
And happid that allone as he was born
He saw a maid walking him beforn
Of which maid anon magre her head
Be verry force byrefte her her maydenhed
For which oppression was such clamor
And such pursuit unto king Artour
That dampened was this knight to be ded
Be course of law he should have lost his head
Parauenture such was the statut tho
But that the queen and other ladies mo
So long praiden the king of grace
Til ^e his liff grauntid in that place
And yaf him to the queen al at her will
To chese whethir she would him save or spylle
The queen thankid the king with all her might
And aftir thus spak she to the knight
When she saw her time up on a day
Thou stondist yet in su^he array
That of thy life yet have thou no ^uerte
I grant thy life if thou can tell me
What thing it is that women most desiren
Bewaar and keep thy neck from iren
And if thou can not tell it anon
I shall the give yet leave forto goon
A twelfmonthe and a day to seche and to lere
An answer su^fici^unt in this matere
And suerte wol I have or that thou pass
Thy body forto y^ldyn in this place
Woo was this knight and sorrowful he sighith
But he may not do al as him likith
And at last he chaas him forto wend
And come ayeen right at the yeris end
With such answer as god would him purueye
And takith his leave and wendith forth his weye
He sekith every house and every place
Where as he hopith forto find grace
To wite what thing women loved most
But he could arryue in no cost
There as he might find in this matere
Two creaturis according in fe^e
Some said women loved best richesse
Some said honor some said Iolinesse
And often times to be widow and to be wed
Some said rich array some said lust a bed
Some said that we be in heart most esid
When we be flaterid and plesid
He goth full nygh the soth I wol not lie
A man shall best win us with flaterye
And with attendaunce and with besines
Ben we y limyd both more and les
And some said that we love best
Forto be fre and do right as us list
And that noman repreue us of our v^ce
But sey that we be wise and no thing nyce
For truly there is non of us all
If any wight wol clawe us on the galle
That we nel kyke for he says us soth
Assay and he shall find it that it does
For be we never so vici^us with ynne
We wol beholden wise and cleen out of sin
And som^e said great delit have we
Forto behold stabil and eke secre
And in on pur^os steadfastly to dwell
And not to bewreye that men us tell
But that tale is not worth a rake stele
Parde we women can no thing hele
Witness on Myda wol ye here the tale
Ouide among other thingis small
Said Myda had under his long heris
Growing upon his head two assis eris
The which vice he hid as he best might
Full subtly from every mannys sight
That save his wife there wyste of it nomo
He l^uyd her most and trus^id her also
He prayde her that to no manner creature
She would tell of his foul diffigure
She swore him that for all the world to win
She nolde do that velony ne sin
To make her husbonde to have so foul a name
She would not it for her owyn shame
But natheles she thought that she deyde
That she so long should a counsel hide
She thought it was so sore about her heart
That nedis some w^rd her most a sterte
And since she durst tell it to no man
Down to the mari^e fast she ran
Til she came there her heart was in fy^e
And as a bitore blondrith in the mire
She leyde her mouth unto the watir down
Bewrey me not thou watir with thy soun
Quod she to the I tell it and to no mo
Mine husbonde has long assis eris two
Now is mine heart al hool now is it out
I might no longer kept it out of doubt
Here mow ye se though we a time abide
Yet out it must we can no coun^el hyde
The remenant of the tale if ye will here
Redith Ouyde and there ye may it lere
This knight of whom my tale is specially
When that he saw he might not come thereby
This is to say what woman louen most
With ynne his breast so sorouful was his ghost
But hoom he goth he might not soiourne
The day was come that homward most he turn
And in his wey as happid him to ride
In all his care under a forest side
Where as he saw upon adaunce go
Of ladijs.xxiiij. and yet mo
Toward which dance he drow full yerne
In hope that he should some wisdom learn
But certainly or that he came fully there
Vanysshed was this dance he nyste where
No creature saw he that baar lyff
Save on the grene he saw sittyng a wife
A fouler wight there might noman d^uyse
Again this knight this old wife began rise
And said sir knight herforth lith no way
Tell me what ye seek be your fay
Parauenture it may the bettir be
These old folk can much thing quod she
My leave mother quod this knight certain
I am but ded but if that I can sayn
What thing it is that women most desire
Could ye me wisshe I would quyte well your hire
Plight me thy truth here in my hond quod she
The next thing that I require the
Thou shall it do if it ly in thy might
And I wol tell it you or it be night
Have here my truth quod the knight I grant
Than quod she I dar well make auaunce
Thy life is sauf for I wol stand there by
Up on my life the queen wol say as I
Leet se which is the prowdist of hem all
That werith other kerchef or call
That dar say nay that I wol the teache
Le^ us go forth without more speech
Tho rowned she a pistil in his here
And bad him be glad and have no fere
When they be common to the court this knight
Said he kept his day as he had hight
And ready was his answer for to have said
Full many a nobil wife and many a maid
And many a widow for that they be wise
The queen her self sittyng as Iustyse
Assemblid been his answer for to here
And aftirward this knight was bodin ^apere
And that every wight was comaundid silence
And that the knight should tell in audi^nce
What thing that wordly women love best
This knight stood not stille as does a be
But to his question anon answerde
With manly voys that all the court it herd
My liege lady then general quod he
Women desiren to have souereynte
As well of her husbondis as of her love
And forto ben in maistrye above
This is your most desire though ye will me kille
Does as you list I am at your will
In all the court ne was there wife ne maid
Ne widow that contraried that he said
But said he was worthy to have his life
And at that word vpstert this old waf
Which that the knight saw sittynge on the grene
Mercy quod she my souerein lady queen
Er that your court depart as does me right
I taught this answer unto the knight
For which he plighte me his truth there
The first thing I would him require
He would hit do if it lay in his might
Before this court than I pray the sir knight
Quod she that thou me take unto thy w^f
For well thou wotist that I have saved thy life
If I swear falls swear nay upon thy ^ey
The knight answerde and said well awey
I woo^ right weel that such was my behest
For goddis love chees a new request
Take al my good and lat my body go
Nay than quod sbe I shrewe us both two
For though that I be foul old and poor
I wol not for all the metal and the oor
That under the ground lith other above
But y thy wife were and eke thy love
My love quod he nay parde my dampnacion
Allas that ever any of my nation
So fou^e should ever disperaged be
But al for naught the end is thus that he
Consireyned was nedis must he wedde
And take his old wif and go to bed
Now would some men sayn parauenture
For mine negligence I do no cure
To tell you the joy and all the array
That at feste was that ilke day
To which thing shortly I answer shall
I say th^re was no feste ne joy at al
There nas but beuynes and muchel sorrow
For privily he weddid here by the morrow
And al day aftir hid him as an owl
So woe was him his wif lokid so foul
Great was the woe that the knight had in thought
When he was with his wif a bed y brought
He walowith and he turnyth to and fro
His ol^e wif lay simylinge ever mo
And said o dear husbonde benedicite
Farith every knight with his wife as ye
Is this the law of king Artours house
Is every knight of his love so dangerous
I am your owen love and eke your wife
I am she which that saved has your life
And certis yet I deed you never unright
Why fare ye thus with me the first night
Ye fare lik a man had lost his wit
What is my gilt for goddis love tell me it
And it shall be amended if that I may
Amendid quoth this knight alas nay nay
It wol not be amendid never the mo
Thou art so lothly and so old also
And thereto common of so low a kind
That litil wonder is though I walow and wind
So would to god quod he mine heart would breast
Is this quod she the cause of your vnreste
Ye certain quod he no wonder it is
Now sire quoth she I could amend all this
If that me list or hit be days three
So well ye might bear you unto me
But for ye spekyn of such gentilnes
As is descendid out of old riches
That therefore ye shulbe gentilmen
Such arrogaunce is not worth an hen
Look who is most virtuous alwey
Pryuy and apert and most entendith ay
To do the gentilist dedis that he can
Take him for the grettist gentilman
First wol we claim of him our gentilnes
Not of our eldres for her old riches
For though they give us al her heritage
For which we claymen to be of here parage
Yet may they bequede for no thing
To none of us her virtuous leuynge
That made hem gentilmen callid to be
And bad hem follow us in such degree
Well can the wise Poet of Forence
That hight daunte speak of this sentence
Lo in such manner ryme is dauntis tale
Full s^lde up rysid be his braunchis small
Preuys of man for god of his goodness
Wol that of him we cl^yme our gentilnes
For of our oldris may we no thing claim
But temporel thing that may hurt and mayme
Eke every wight woot this as well as I
If gentilnes were plantid naturally
Unto a certain lynage down the line
Privy and pert than wol they not fine
To do of gentilnes the feir office
They might do no vilon^ or vice
Take fire and bear it in to the derkist house
Betwix this and the mount of Cancasus
And leet men shi^te the doris and go then
Yet wol the fire as fairly and brenne
As twenty thousand men might it behold
His o^fice naturelly ay wol he hold
Up peril of my lif till that it dye
Here may ye se how that gentrye
Is not annexed to possessioun
Such folk ne does her operacioun
Alwey as does the fire in his kind
For god it woot men may full often find
A lordis sone do shame and velony
And he that wol have price of his genterye
For he was born of a gentil house
And had his eldris nobil and virtuous
And nyl hem self do no gentil dedis
Ne folowen the dedis of his auncetrys
He is not gentil be he duk be he earl
Fie vileyns sinful dedis makyn a cherle
For gentilnes nys but the renome
Of thyn auncetris for her high bounte
Which is a strange thing to thy person
Thy gentilnes comyth fro god alone
Than comyth our verry gentilnes of grace
It was no thing be quedyn us with our place
Thynkith how nobil as seith valerius
Was that romain Tullius Hostilius
That out of pouert ro^s to high noblesse
Redith Senek and redith ek Boece
There shul ye se expres that no dread is
That he is gentil that does gentil dedis
And therefore l^ue husbonde thus I conclude
Were it that mine auncetris were rude
Yet may the hye god and so hope I
Grant me grace to live virtuously
Than am I gentil when I begin
To live virtuously and do awey sin
And there as ye of pouerte me repreue
That high god on whom hoolly we believe
In full hertis pouerte chees to lead his life
And syns every man maiden or wife
May understand that Ihesus our heuyn king
Ne would not chese a uicyous lynynge
Glad pouert is a full honest thing certain
This wol Senec and other clerkis sayn
Who so that holdith him paid of his pouert
I hold him rich and he had not a shert
He that coueytith he is a full pour wight
For he would have that is not in his might
But he the naught has naught coueytith to have
Is rich al though ye hold him but a knave
Verry pouerte is an high joy properly
Iuuenal spekith thereof full merrily
The pour man when he goth be the wey
Before the theu^s he may sing and pley
Pouert is hateful good as I ges
A full great brynger out of besynes
A greet amender eke of sapience
To him that takith it in patience
Pouerte is this al though it seem elenge
Possessioun that noman would gladly challenge
Pouerte full often when a man is low
Makith his god and eke him self to know
Pouert a spectakil is as thinkith me
Through which he may his very frendis se
And therefore sir since therein ye be grieved
Of my pouert late me no more be repreued
Now sire of elde also ye repreuyd me
And certis ^ire though non auctorite
Were in the book the gentil of hauour
Sayn that men should an old wife do honor
And clepid fader for their gentilnes
And auctours shall I find as I ges
Now there as ye say I am foul and old
Than dread ye not to be made Cokeold
For filthe elde and foul so mot I the
Been great wardeyns upon chastity
But natheles since I know your delit
I shall fulfille your wordly appetit
Chees now quoth she on of these thingis tweye
To have me old and foul til that I deye
And be to you a true humble wyff
And never you displese in all my lyff
Or ellis ye shall have me young and feyr
And take your adventure of the repeyr
That to your house shall be by cause of me
Or in some other place may well be
Now chees whether that ye likith
This knight auysith him and sikith
But at the last he said in this manner
My lady my love and my wife so dear
I put me fully in your wise governance
Chese it your self which may be more plesaunce
And most honor to you and to me also
I do no force whethir of the two
But as you likith it suffisith to me
Than I have got of you the maistrye quod she
Syn I may chese and govern you as me list
Ye certis wife quod he I hold it for the best
Kys me quod she we be no lengir wroth
For be my truth quod she I wol to you be both
That is to say both fair and eek good
I pray to god that I must sterue wood
But I to you be also good and true
As ever was wife syn the world was new
And but I be to morrow as fair to seen
As any lady Emperesse or queen
That is betwixt the est and the west
Does with my life and death as you list
And so they slepte til it was morrow gray
And then she said when it was day
Cast up the curten look how it is
And when the knight saw verily all this
That she so fair was and so young thereto
For joy he hent her in his armies two
His heart was bathid in a bath of blis
A thousand time arowe he began her kis
She obey^d him in every thing
That might do him plesaunce or likyng
And thus they live unto her lives end
And parfyt joy as Ihu us send
Husbondis meke young and fresh a bed
And grace to our live hem that we wedde
And eek I pray Ihesus short her liuys
That wol not be governed be her wyuys
And old and angry nygardis of dispense
God send hem sone a foul verry pestilence
.Here endith the tale of the wife of bathe.. And begins the prolog of the
friar.
THis nobyl limytour this worthy friar
He made alwey a manner louryng chere
Up on the sompnour but for honest
No vileyns word as yet spak he
But at last he said unto the wife of bathe
Dame quoth he god you ever keep fro scathe
For here ye have touchid also moot y the
In scole matter a full greet difficulte
Ye have said much thing right coriously
But dame here as ye riden be the wey
Us nedith not to speak but of game
And let auctours be a goddis name
To prechinge and to scole of clergy
And if it likith unto this gentil company
I would you of a sompnour tell a game
Parde ye mow well known be the name
That of a sompnour may no good be said
I pray that non of you be evil a paid
A sompnour is a renner up and down
With maundementis for fornicacion
And y beat at every townys end
Our oste than spak a sir ye should be hend^
And certis a man of your astat
In company we wol have no debaat
Tellith your tale and leet the sompnour be
Nay quod the sompnour let him say by me
What so him list when it comyth to my lot
Be god I shall him quyte every grot
I shall him tell which a great honor
It is to be a flateryng lymytour
And of many another manner crime
Which nedith not to reherce at this time
And his office I shall him tell ywis
Our ost answerde pes no more of this
And aftir this he said unto the friar
Tell forth your tale mine owyn master dear
Here endith the Freris prolog. And here begins his tale.
WHilom there was duellyng in my contre
An archedekyn a man of high degree
That boldly did full many an execucion
In punysshynge of every fornicacion
Of whi^hecraft and eke of baudrye
Of diffamacion and auoutrye
Of church reuys and of testamentis
Of contract and of lak of sacrementis
Of vsurye and eke of symonye also
But certis lechours did he much woo
They should syngen if that they were hent
And small tithers also were foul shent
If any person would upon him pleyne
There might asterte no pecunial pain
For small tithis and small offering
He made the pepyl full pitously to sing
For or the bishop caught him with his hook
They were in the archedekenys book
And than had he thourgh his Jurisdiction
Pour of hem to do full correction
He had a sompnour ready to his hond
A slygher boy was non in engelond
For sotilly he had his especial
That taught him where he might auayl
He knew of lechours one or two
To teache him to four and twenty mo
For though the sompnour were as wood as an hare
To tell his harlotrye I wol not spare
For we be out of his correction
They have of us no Jurisdiction
Ne never shall term of al her lyuys
Petir so be women of the styuys
Quod the sompnour put out of my cure
Pees with myschaunce or with mys adventure
Said our ost and leet him tell his tale
Now tell forth though the sompnour gale
Ne sparith not mine owen master dear
This ^als thief the sompnour quoth the friar
Had alwey ready bawdis to his hand
As any hawk is to the lure in engelonde
That told him all the secre that they could
For her acquaintance was not alwey nouthe
They were all his approwers privily
He took him self a great prouffit thereby
His master knew not alwey what he wan
Withouten maundementis of lewd men
He could sompne on pain of cristis curs
And they were glad forto fillen his purs
And make him great festis at the nale
And right as Judas had pursis small
And was a thief right ^uch a thef was he
His master had but half his dute
He was if I shall give him the laud
A thief a Sompnour and eke a baude
He had eke wenchis at his retenu
That whether sir robert or sir hue
Or Jack or raaf or who so that it were
That lay by hem they told him in his ere
Thus were the wenchis and he of on assent
And he would fet a faynyd maundement
And sompne hem to the Chapetre both two
And pyle the man and let the wenche go
Than would he say friend I shall for thy sake
Do stryke her out of our lettris blake
The dar no more as in this caas travail
I am thy friend there I may the auaylle
Certain he knew of bribours meny mo
Than possible is to tell in yeris two
For in this world nys dog for the bow
That can an hurt dear from an hool know
Better than this sompnour knows a lechour
Or avoutrer or ellis any Paramour
And for that was the fruit of al his rent
Therefore on it he set al his intent
And so befyl that onys up on aday
This sompnour was ever waytyng his pray
Forto sompne an old wife horrible
Feynynge a cause for he would her bridil
It happid that he saw ^^^orn him ride
Agay yeman under a f^rest side
A bow he baar and (...) bright and kene
He had upon him a kirtil of grene
An hat up on his head with strengis blake
Sire quod the sompnour heyl and well y take
Welcome quod he and every good felaw
Whithir ridist thou under this grene wode shaw
Said this yoman wolt thou fare with me to day
This sompnour answerde and said nay
Here fast by quod he is mine intent
To ridyn forto reyse up all the rent
That longith now to my lordis duete
Art thou than a baylle ye quod he
He ne durst for velonye and shame
Say that he was a sompnour for the name
Deperdeux quod this sompnour dear brother
Thou art a baylle and I am another
I am unknown now in this contre
Of thyn acquaintance then I pray the
And eek of bretherhed if that thou list
I have gold and siluyr in my chist
If that the happith to come in our shire
Al shall be thyn right as thou wolt desire
Gramercy quod this sompnour be my feith
Euerich in other hond he leyith
Forto be sworn til that they deye
In daliaunce they ride forth and pleye
This sompnour which was full of Iangelis
As full of venym ben these were^angelis
And ever enquiryng upon every thing
Broth^r quod he where is now your duellyng
Anothir day if that I shall you seche
This yoman him answerde with soft speech
Broth^r quod he fer in the North cuntre
Where as I hope some time I shall the se
Er we depart y shall the so well wis
That of my house ne shall thou never mys
Now brother quod this sompnour I you pray
Teache me whiles ye ridith be the way
Syn that ye be a baylly and so am I
Some subtilte as tellith me seithfully
In mine office how I may most win
And sparith not for conscience of sin
But dear brothir tell me how do ye
Now be my truth dear brother said he
As I shall tell the a faithful tale
My wagis be full stre^t and small
My lord is hard to me and dangerous
And mine office is full laborous
And therefore by extorsions I live
For soth I take all that men wol me give
Algate be sleyghte or be violence
From year to year I win al my dispense
I can no bettir tell the feithfully
Now certis quod the sompnour so fare I
I spare not to take god it wot
But if it be to heavy or to hoot
That I may ge^e in counsel privily
No More conscience of that have I
Nere mine extorsioun I might not liuyn
Of such iapis wol I not be shryuyn
Stomak ne conscience know I none
I shrewe the shrifte fadris euerichone
Well be we met be god and be saint Iame
But leave brothir tell me thy name
Quod this sompnour in this mean while
This yeman began a lityl forto smyle
Brothir quod he wolt thou that y the tell
I am a fend my duellynge is in hell
And here I ride about my purchasinge
To wite if men wol give me any thing
To purchase is the effect of al my rent
Look how thou ridist for all the same intent
To win good thou reckist never how
Right so fare I for ride would I now
Unto the worldis end for a pray
A quod the sompnour benedicite what ye say
I wend ye had been a yoman trewly
Ye have a mannys shap as well as I
Have ye than a figure determynat
In hell there ye be in your astat
Nay certainly quod he there have we noon
But when us likith we can take us on
Or ellis make you wene we be shape
Sometime lik a man and sometime lik an ape
Or lik an aungel can I ride or go
It is no wonder thing though it be so
A lowsy iogolour can disceyue the
And parde yet more craft can I than he
Why quod the sompnour ride ye than or goon
In sundry shap and not alwey in oon
For we quoth he wol us in such form make
As most auayl is our prays forto take
What makith you to have all this labor
Well many a cause leave sir sompnour
Said this fend but al thing has time
The day is short and it is passid pryme
And yet ne gat I no thing in this day
I wol entende to winning if I may
And not entende our wittis to declare
For brothir mine thy wittis ben al to bare
To understand though I told hem the
But for thou axist why labor we
For sumtyme we be goddis instrumentis
And meues to do his comaundementis
When that him list upon his creaturis
In diverse act and in diverse figuris
Without him we have no might certain
If that him list to stonden there again
And some time at our pray have we leave
Only the soul and not the body to grieve
Witness of Job whom we did woo
And some time have we might on both two
This is to say on soul and on body eek
And sometime we be suffrid for to seek
Up on a man and do his soul vnreste
And not his body and al for the best
When he withstandith our temptacion
It is a cause of his salvation
Al be it that it was not our intent
He should be saaf by goddis Judgment
And sometime we be servant unto man
As to the archebisshop saint Dunstan
And to the apostil servant was I
Yet tell me quod the sompnour feithfully
Make ye your bodies in such wise always
Of elementis the fend answerde nay
Some time we faynyn and some time we arise
With deed bodies in feel sundry wise
And speak as resonabil fair and well
As the Phitonysse did to Samuel
And yet wol some men sayn it was not he
I do no force of your divinity
But o thing warn I the I wol not iape
Thou wolt wete algatis how we be shape
Thou shall here aftirward my brother dear
Come where it nedith not of me to lere
For thou shall by thyn owen experience
Conne in the chayer read this sentence
Better than Virgile while he was on live
Or david also now leet us ride belyue
For I wol hold company with the
Til it be so that thou forsake me
Nay quod the sompnour that shall not betide
I am a yeman that known am full wide
My truth wol I hold to the as in this caas
For though were the devil Sathanas
Take thou thy part of that men wol the give
And I shall mine thus may we both live
And if that any of us have more than other
Let him be true and part with his brothir
I grant quod the devil be my fey
And with that word they riden forth her wey
And right at an enter of a townys end
To which the sompnour shoop him forto wend
They saw a carte that charged was with hey
Which that a carter drof forth in the wey
Deep was the wey for which the Carte stood
This carter smoot and cryde as he were wood
What heyt brok heyt scot spare ye for the nonys
The fend quod he you fecche body and bonys
As ferforth as ever ye were y folid
So mykil woe as I have for you tholid
The devil have both horse Carte and hey
Quod the sompnour here shall we have a pley
And near the feend he drow as naught ne were
Full privily and rowned in his ere
Herkyn my brother herkyn be thy feith
Herist thou not hou the carter seith
Take hit anon for he has give it the
Both hey and carte and eek his capullis three
Nay quod the devil / god woot never a ^eel
It is not his intent trust me weel
Ask him self if that thou trowest not me
Or ellis stynte awhyle and thou shall se
This carter thackid his horse on the croupe
And they begone to draw and to stoop
Hait now quod he that Ihesu crist you bles
And al his hondy work both more and les
That was well y twight mine owen liard boy
I pray to god save the and saint loy
Now is my carte out of the slowgh parde
Lo brother quod the fend what told I the
Here may ye se mine owen dear brother
The chorle spak o thing but he thought another
Let us go forth about our viage
Here win I no thing upon this carriage
When that they common somewhat out of the town
This sompnour to his brothir began to roun
Brother quod he here wonyth an old rebecke
That had almost as leef to lose her neck
As forto give apeny of her good
I wol have.xijd. though that she be wood
Or I wol somone her unto our office
And yet god woot of her I know no vice
But for thou can not as in this contre
Win thy cost / take here ensaumple of me
This sompnour clappid at the widowis gate
Com out he said thou old verry trate
I trow thou have some priest or friar with the
Who knockith said this wife benedicite
God save you sir what is your sweet will
I have quod the sompnour of the a bil
Up on pain of cursinge look that you be
To morrow beforn the Archedekenys kne
To answer to the court of certain thing
Now lord quod she Ihesu crist heuene king
So wisly help me as y ne may
I have be sik and that ^ul many a day
I may not go so fer quod she ne ride
But I be ded so prickith it in my side
May I not axe a libel sire sompnour
And answer there be my proktour
To such thing as men wol appose me
Yes quod the sompnour pay anon let se
Twelf pens to me and I wol the quyte
I shall no prouffit have thereby but lyte
My master has the prouffit and not I
Com of and let me ride hastily
Give me.xij. pens for I may no longer tarry
Xij. pens quod she a lady saint mary
So wisly help me out of care and sin
This wide world though I should it win
Ne have I not.^ijd. with in my hold
Ye know well that I am pour and old
Kithe your alms ou me pour wrecche
Nay than quod he the foul fend me fecche
If I the excuse though thou sholdist be spilt
Allas quoth she god woot I am not in the gilt
Pay me quod he or be sweet saint anne
I wol anon bear awey thyn new pan
For debt which thou owe me of old
When that thou madist thyn husbond cokeolde
I paid at hoom for thy correction
Thou lixt quod she be my sauacion
Ne was I never or now widow or wife
Sompned unto your court in all my life
Ne never y was but of my body true
Unto the devil blak and rowgh of hew
Give I thy body and eke my pan to
And when the devil herd her curse so
Up on her knees he said in this manner
Now mabyll mine owen mother dear
Is this your will in ernest as ye say
The devil quod she fette him or he dey
And pan and al but he wol him repent
Nay old stot that is not mine intent
Quod the sompnour forto repent me
For any thing that I have had of the
I would I had thy smook and every ^loth
Now brothir quod the devil be not wroth
Thy body and this pan is mine be right
Thou shall with me to hell yet to night
Where thou shall know of our priuyte
More than a master of divinity
And with that word the soul fend him hent
Body and soul he with the devil went
Where that these sompnours have her heritage
And god that made aftir his image
Mankind save and gide us all and some
And leave that Sompnours good men be com
Lording I could tell you quod the friar
Had I had leave for this sompnour here
Aftir the text of c^ist Poule and John
And of our other doctors meny on
Such poyntis as your hertis might agryse
Al be it so nothing may I deuyse
Though that I might a thousand winter tell
The peynys of that cursid pain of hell
But forto keep us fro that cursid place
Wakith and prays Ihesu of his grace
So keep us fro the temptour Sathanas
H^rkenyth this word bewaar in this caas
The lioun sittith in his awayte always
To sle the Innocent if that he may
Dispose ye your hertis ay to withstonde
The fend that wol make you thral and bond
He may not tempte you ouyr your might
For crist wol be your champioun and knight
And pray that the sompnour him repent
Of his mysdedis or that the devil him hent
Here endith the Freris tale. And begynnyth the Sompnours prolog.
THis Sompnour in his stirop high stood
Up on this friar his heart was so wood
That lik an aspin leef he quook for ire
Lordingis quod he o thing I desire
I you beseech of your curtesye
Sith ye have herd this false friar lie
As suffrith me I may a tale tell
This friar bostith that he knows hell
And god woot that is litil wonder
Freris and fendis been but litil a sunder
For parde ye have often time herd tell
How that a friar rauysshed was to hell
In spirit onys be auysioun
And as an aungil led him up and down
To show him the preuytes that were there
In all the place saw he not a friar
Of other folk he saw ynowe in woe
Unto this aungil spak this friar tho
Now sire quod he have freris such a grace
That non of hem shall come in this place
Yes quod the aungel many a myllioun
And unto Sathanas he ladde him a down
And now has Sathanas such a tail
Bradder than of a Carik is the sail
Hold up thy tail thou Sathanas quod he
Show sorth thyn ars and let the friar se
Where is the nest of Freris in this place
And er that a furlong wey of space
Right so as bees swarm out of an hyue
Out of the deuelis ars they gone drive
Twenty thousand freris on a route
And through out hell swarmed al about
And came ayeen as fast as they may goon
And in to his ars they crepte in euerichon
He clippid ayeen his tail and lay stylle
This friar when he lokid had his will
Up on the tormentis of this sorry place
His spirit god restorid of his grace
Unto his body ayeen and he awook
But natheles for feer yet he quok
So was the devil ay in his mind
Than is it his heritage of verry kind
God save you all save this cursid friar
My prolog will I end in this manner
Here endith the prolog. And begins the Sompnours tale.
LOrdingis quoth he in yorkshire as I guess
Is a mersh contre that callid is holdernes
In which there went a lymytour about
To preche and eke to beg it is no doubt
And so be fyl that on aday this friar
Had pre^hid in a church in his manner
And specially abouen every thing
Excitid he the p^pil in his prechinge
To trentalis and to give for goddis sake
Where with men might holy housis make
There as deuyne seruyse ^s honourid
Not there it is wastid and deuouryd
Ne there it nedith not to be yeuyn
As to possessioners that mow lyuyn
Thankid be god in well and habundaunce
Trentals said he deliuereyn from penance
Here frendis soulis as well old as young
Ye when they be so hastily y song
Not forto hold a pressed Ioly and gay
He syngeth but o mass on aday
Delivers out anon quod he the soulis
Full hard it is with fleshook and oulis
To been I clawed / or to brenne or bake
Now speed you hastily for cristis sake
And when this friar had said his intent
With qui cum patre / forth his wey he went
When folk in the church had give what hem lest
He went his wey no longer would he rest
With skippe and tippid staf y tukkid hye
In every mannys house he began to pour and prye
And beggid mele or chese or ellis corn^
His felaw had a staf I tippid with horn^
A peyre of tablis of clean yuory
And a poyntel y polysshed fetously
And wroot the namys alwey as he stood
Of all the folk that yaf him any good
A^kaunce that he would for hem pray
Give us a busshel whete mele or reye
A goddis kichil or a crip of chese
Or ell^s what you list I may not chese
A goddis half penny or a mass penny
Or give us of your braun if ye have any
A dagget of your blanket leave dame
Our sustir dear lo here I write your name
Bacon or chese or such thing as ye find
A sturdy harlot went him ay behind
That was her oste and ever he baar a sak
And what men yaf him leyde it on his bak
And when he was out at door anoon
He planed awey the namys euerichon
That he beforn had write in his tablis
He served hem with nyflis and with fablis
Nay there thou lie Sompnour quod the friar
Pees quod our ost for cristis modir dear
Tell forth thy tale and spare it not at al
So thryue y quod the sompnour so I shall
So long he went from house to house til he
Came to an house there he was wont to be
Refresshid more than in an hundrid placis
Seek lay the good man whoos the place is
Bedrede up on a bench low he lay
Deus hic quod he O Thomas good day
Said this friar curtesly and fre
Thomas god yield you full often time quod he
I have on this bench I fare full weel
Here have I etyn many a merry meel
And fro the benche he droof a wey the cat
And le^de a down his potent and his hat
And eke his skrippe and set him soft a down
His felaw was walkid in to the town
Forth with his knave in to that osterye
Where as he shoop him that night to ly
O dear master said this sik man
How have ye faryn syn march began
I saw you not this fourtenyght ne more
God woot quod he labourid have I full sore
And specially for thy salvation
Have y said many a precious orison
And for our other frendis god hem bless
I have this day be at your church at mess
And said a sermon to my lewd wit
Not aftir the plain text of holy wryt
For it is hard to you as I suppose
And therefore tell I you all the gloss
Glosinge is a full glorious thing certain
For lettir sleth as we clerkis seyn
There have I taught hem to be charitable
And spend her good there it is reasonable
And there I saw our dame where is she
Yonder in the yerd I trow that she be
Said this man and she wol come anon
Ey master well com be ye by saint John
Said this wife how fare ye hertely
This friar arisith up full coriously
And here emb^asith in his armies narow
And kissith here sweet and chirkith as a sparow
With his lippis / dame quod he right weel
As he that is your servant euerideel
Thankid be god that yaf you soul and life
Yet saw I not to day so fair awyf
In all the church so god save me
Ye god amend the fantis sir quod she
Algatis welcome ye be by my fey
Gramercy dame that have I found alwey
But of your great goodness be your leave
I would pray you that ye you not grieve
I wol with Thomas speak a litil word
Th^se Curatouris ben not worth a tord
To gropen tenderly a mannys conscience
In shrifte and in preching is my diligence
And study on Petris wordis and Poulis
I walk about and cleanse mennys sowlis
To y^lde Ihesu crist his proper rent
To ^^re^^ his wordis is al mine intent
Now be your (...) dear sire quod she
Ch^dith him well for saint charity
He is ay angry as is a pissemyre
Though that he have all that he can desire
Though I him w^ye and make him warm
And over him ley my leg and mine arm
He gronyth lik our boor lith in our sty
Other disport of him right noon have I
I may not plese him in no manner caas
O Thomas Ie vous d^ Thomas Thomas
This makith the fend this most be amendid
Ire is a thing that holy god offendith
And there of wol I speak a word or two
Now master quod the wife or that ye go
What will ye dyne I wol go there about
Now dame quod he Ie vous die sannz doubt
Have I of a Capon but the liver
And of your white breed but a shyuyr
And aftir that a rostid piggis head
But y ne would for me that no be were ded
Than had I with you hoolly suffisaunce
I am a man of litil sustenaunce
My spirit has his fosteryng in the bibyl
My body is ay so ready and so penyble
To make that my body is full destroid
I pray you dame that ye be not annoied
Though I you my counsel so friendly show
Be god I nolde have told it but a few
And sire quod she but o word or I goo
My child is ded with ynne this wokis two
Sone aftir that ye went out of this town
His death saw I be reuelacioun
Said this friar at hoom in our dortoure
I dar well say that with ynne half an hour
Aftir his death I saw him bore to blis
In mine visioun so god my soul wis
So deed our Sexten and our fermerer
That have be true freris this.xl. year
They may now god bethanked of his love
Maken her Iubilee and walkyn al above
And up I roos / and al our covent eek
With many a teer trillyng on my cheek
Withouten noise and clatering of bellis
Te deum was our song and no thing ellis
Sone aftir to crist I bad an holy orisoun
Thanking him of my good reuelacioun
For sire and dame trustith me right weel
Our orisons been more effectuel
And more we se of cristis secret thingis
Than borel pepil al be they kyngis
We live in pensifnesse and in abstinence
And borel folk in riches and dispense
Of mete and drink and in foul delight
We have the worldis lust al in despit
Lazar and dives liueden full diversely
And diverse guerdoms had they there by
Who so wol pray must fast and be clean
And satte his soul and make his body lene
We fare as says the Apostil cloth and food
Suffisith us though they be not full good
The clenn^sse and the fasting of us freris
Makith that Crist ex^eptith our praieris
Lo moses.xl. days and.xl. night
Fastid or that god full of his might
Spak with him in the mount Synay
With empty womb of fasting many a day
There resceyued he the law that was writyn
With goddis finger and Ely well ye wetyn
In the mount Ore^ or he had any speech
With high god that is our lyuys leche
He fastid long and was in contemplance
Aaron that had the tempil in gouenaunce
And eke the other prestis euerichon^
Into the tempil when they should goon
To prayen for the pepyl and do seruise
They nolde drink in no manner wise
No drink that might hem drunk make
B^t there in abstinence to pray and wake
Lest that they deyden take heed what I say
But they be sober that for the pepyl pray
Ware that I say for it ynow suffisith
Our lord Jesus as holy writ deuisith
Yaf us ensampyl of fasting and praieris
Therefore we mendicantis we pour freris
Been weddid to pouerte and to continoice
To charity humbilnes and patience
To persecucion for every rightwisnes
To weping misericord and to clennes
And therefore mow ye se that our prayers
I speak of us we mendicaunt freris
Be to the high god more exceptable
Than youris with your festis at your tubyl
Fro Paradis first if I shall not lie
Was man out chasid for his glotenye
And cast was out to labor certain
But harken now Thomas what I shall sayn
I have no text of it as I suppose
But I find a manner thing of a gloss
That specially our sweet lord Ihesus
Spak this by freris when he said thus
Blissid ben they that pour in spiryt been
And so forth all the gospel mow ye seen
Whethir it be liker to our professioun
Or heris that swymmen in possessioun
Fie on her Poompe and her glotenye
And of her lewdness I hem deffye
Me thinks they be lik to Iomman
Fat as a whale and walk lik a swan
Al vinolent as a botel in the spence
Her prayer is of full litil reverence
When they for soulis say the psalm of David
Lo buf they sey Cor meum eructauit
Who folowith cristis gospel and his lore
But we that humble be chaste and pore
Workars of goddis wordis and not auditors
Therefore right as an hauk up on his sours
Up springith in to the eyr so praieris
Of charitable and chaste f^eris
Makyn hem sown to goddis eris two
Thomas Thomas so moot I ride or go
And by that lord that clepid was saint Iue
Ne thou our brother were sholdist thu nener thryue
In our chapitre pray we both day and night
To crist to send the both health and might
Thy body forto welden full hastily
God woot quod he no thing there of feel I
As help me god as in few yeris
Have I spendid on many diverse freris
Full many apound yet fare I never the bet
Certain my good have I almost beset
Farwell my gold for it is al a go
The friar answered o Thomas do thou so
What nedith the diverse freris forto seche
What nedith him that has a parfyt leche
To sechen other lechis in any town
Your in constaunce is your confusioun
Hold ye than me and eke al our covent
To preye for you be not sufficient
Thomas that iape is not worth a myte
Your maladye is for we have to lyte
And give that covent four and twenty grotis
And give that covent half a quartir otis
And give that friar a penny and let him go
Nay^ nay Thomas it may no thing be so
What is a ferthing worth partid on twelve
Lo each thing that is onyd in him selue
Is more strong than when it is skaterid
Thomas of me thou shall not be flaterid
Thou woldist have our labor al for naught
The high god that all this world ha^h wrought
Says that the workman is worthy his hire
Thomas of your tresour naught wol I desire
As for my self but that our Covent
To pray for you be ay so diligent
And forto hold up cristis owen church
Thomas if ye wol learn forto wirche
Of bildynge upon chirchis mow ye find
If it be good in Thomas lif of ynde
Ye lain here full of angir and of ire
With which the devil set your heart on fire
And chiden here the holy Innocent
Your wife that is here so meke and so pacient
And therefore Thomas trow me if thou list
Ne strive not with thy wife as for the best
And bear these word awey now be thy faith
Touching such thing. lo what the wise says
With ynne thy house ne be thou no lioun
To thy subiectis do thou noon oppression
Ne make thyn acquaintance not to fle
And Thomas yet ^ft sons warn I the
Be war of her that in thy bosom slepith
Ware fro the serpent that so slily crepith
Under the gras and styngeth full subtly
Bewar of her and herkyn patiently
That twenti thousand men have lost her lyuys
For striuyng with her lemmans and her wyuys
Now syn ye have so holy a meke wife
What nedith you Thomas to make stryf
There nys iwys no serpent so cruel
When a man tredith upon his tail ne half so fell
As a woman is when she has caught ire
Verry vengeance is than al her desire
Ire is a sin of the great seuyn
And full abhominabil to the king of heuyn
And to him self it is a destruction
This every lewd vicar or parson
Can sey how Ire engendrith homicide
Ire in soth is the executour of pride
I could of Ire say right much sorrow
That my tale should last til to morrow
And therefore pray I god both day and night
That to an yrous man god send litil might
It is great harm and certis great pity
To set an yrous man in high degree
^Hylom there was an yrous potestate
Which hasty was in Judgment algate
Upon a day out riden knyghtis two
And as fortune would that it was so
That on of hem came hoom that other did naught
Anon the knight before the Judge is brought
That said thus thou have thy fellow slain
For which I deem the to the death certain
And to anothir knight commanded he
Go led him to the death I charge the
And happid as they wentyn be the way
Toward the place where he should dey
The knight came which that men went had be ded
Then thought they it were the best reed
To lead hem both to the Judge again
They sayden lord the knight has not sleyn
His felaw here he stont hool a live
Ye shall be ded quod he so mot I thryue
This is to say both on two and three
And to the ^irste knight right thus spak he
I dampened the thou most algatis be ded
And thou also most nedis lose thyn head
For thou art cause why thy felaw deyeth
And to the thridde knight right thus he sey^th
Thou have not do that I comaundid the
And thus he did hem sle al three
IRus Cambustus was eek dronkelew
And ay delitid him to be a shrew
And so befil a lord of his meyne
That louyd well virtuous moralite
Said on a day betwix hem self right thus
A lord is lost if he be aught vicious
And dronkenesse is eke a foul record
Of any man and namely of a lord
Th^r is many an ye and meny an ere
Away^ynge on a lord he not not where
For goddis love drynketh more temperatly
Wine makith a man to live wrecchidly
His mind and eek his lymys euerichon
The reuerse shall thou se quoth he anon
And preue it be thyn owen experience
That wyn ne does to folk such offense
There is no wyn that bereuyth me my might
Of hond of foot ne of mine yen sight
And for despit he drank ^u^he the more
An hundrid part than he did before
And right anon this yrous cursid wrecche
This knyghtis sone le^t beforn him fecche
Comaundid him he should beforn him stand
And suddenly he took his bow in hand
And up the streng he pullith to his here
And with an arow he slough the child there
Now wethir have I a siker hond or none
Quod he is al my might and mind a goon
Has wyn bereued me mine yen sight
What should I tell the answer of the knight
His sone was sleyn there is no more to say
Beth ware therefore with lordis for to play
Syngeth Placebo and I shall if I can
But if it be unto a pour man
To a pour man men should his vicis tell
But not to a lord though he should go to hell
LO Irus turrus that strong percien
How destroyde he the river of gysen
For that an horse of his was dreynt there ynne
When that he went Babylon for to win
He made that the river was so small
That men might ride and wade over al
Lo what said he that so well teache can
Ne be no fellow to an yrous man
Ne with no wood man walk by the way
Lest thou repent I wol no forther say
Now Thomas leave brother leef thyn Ire
Thou shall me find as just as a squiev^
Hold not the deuylis knyf ay in thy heart
Thy anger does me alto sore smerte
But show to me al thy confession^
Nay quod the sik man be saint Simon
I have be shriue this day of my curat
I have him told al mine heart
It nedith no more to speak of it said he
But if it list of mine humylite
Give me than of thy good to make our cloister
Said he for many a muskle and meny an oyster
When other men have been full well at ese
Have been our food our cloister forto reyse
And yet god woot uneath our fundement
Parfourmed is ne of our church full pament
There is not a tile with ynne our wonys
Be god we owe fifty pound for stonys
Now help Thomas for him that harowed hell
Or ellis most we our bokis selle
And if men lack our predicacion
Than goth the world al to destruction
For who so wol fro this world us bereue
So god me save Thomas be your leave
He would bereue out of this world the son
For who can teache and work as we konne
And that is not of litil time quod he
But seth Ely was or Elyse
Have freris he that find I of recordr
In charity y thanked be our lord
Now Thomas help for saint charity
And down anon he sittith on his kne
This sik man wext nygh wood for ire
He would that the friar had be a fire
With his false dissimulacion
Such thingis as ben in my possession
Quod he that may I give you and non other
Ye sey me thus how that I am your brothir
Ye certis quoth the friar trustith me right well
I took our dame our lettir and our seel
Now well quod he and somewhat shall I give
Unto your holy Covent while y live
And in thy hond thou shall it have anon^
On this condition and other non
That thou depart it so my dear brother
That every friar have as much as other
This shall thou swear on thy professioun
Without fraud or cauillacioun
I swear it quod the friar up on my feith
And there with all his hond in his he leith
Lo here my feith in me shall be no lak
Than put thy hond a down right be my bak
Seyde this man and grope well be hynde
Be nethe my buttok there shall thou find
A thing that I have hid in priuyte
A thought this friar that shall go with me
And down his hond he launchith to the clifte
In hope forto find there some good yefte
And when this sik man felt this friar
About his towel gropinge here and there
Amyd his hond he let the friar a fart
There is no Capul drawing in a Cart
That might have let a fart of such a soun
The friar up stert as does a wood lioun
A falls chorle quod he for Cockis bonys
This have thou in despit do for the nonys
Thou shall a bye this fart if that y may
His meyne with that herdyn such array
Com lepynge in and chasid out the friar
And forth he goth with a full heavy chere
And fe^te his fellow there as lay his stoor
He looked as he were a wild boor
And grintith with the teth so was he wroth
A sturdy paas down to the court he goth
W^^re as there woned a man of great honor
To whom that he was alwey Confessor
This worthy man was lord of that vilage
This fr^re came as he were in a rage
W^^re as this lord sat etyng at his board
Uneath might the friar speak o word
Til at last he ^^yde god you se
This lord began look and said benedicite
What fr^re John what manner world is this
I se well some thing there is amys
Ye l^ke as though the wode were full of theuys
Sit down and tell me what your grieve is
And it shall be amendid if I may
I have quod he had a despit to day
God yield it you a down in your village
That in this world th^r ny^ so pour a page
That he nolde have abhominacion
Of that I have received in the town
And yet it greuy^h not me half so sore
As that the old ^horl with lo^kis hoar
Blassemyd has our holy Covent eke
Now master quod the lord I you beseke
No master sir quod he but seruitour
Though y have had in scole that honor
God likith not that raby men us call
Nothir in market ne in our large halle
Ne fors quod he but tell me al your greef
Sir quod this friar in odious myschief
This day be tyd is mine order and me
And so per consequens in each degree
Of holy church god amend it sone
Sir quod the lord ye woot what is to done
Distempere you not ye be my confessor
Ye be the salt of the earth and the savor
For goddis love your patience now hold
Tell me your greef and he anon him told
As ye have herd beforne ye woot well what
The lady of the house ay stylle sat
Til she had herd what the friar said
Ey goddis mother quod she the blissid maid
Is there aught ellis tell me feithfully
Madame quod he how think ye there by
How that me thinkith quod she so god me speed
I say a chorl has do a chorlis deed
What should y say god let him never the
His sik head is full of vanite
I hold him in a manner of a fransy
Madame quod he be god I shall not lie
But I in any wise may on him a wreke
I shall di^fame him over al where y speak
That falls blasfemur that chargid me
To part that wol not departid be
To every ylike much with myschaunce
The lord sat stille as he were in a trance
And in his heart he rollid up and down
How that this chorle had dilectacion
To show such a problem to the friar
Never erst to now herd I of such a matere
I trow the devil put it in his mind
In ars metrik shall there noman find
Beforn this day of such a questioun
Who should make a demonstracion
That every man should have lik his part
As of a soun or of a souour of a fart
O nyce proud chorle I shrew his face
Lo sirs quod the lord with hard grace
To every y like tell me how
That a fart should be departid now
Hit is an impossible it may not be
Ey nyce chorle god let him never the
The rombling of a fart and every soun
Nys but of air reuerberacioun
And there it wastith litil and litil awey
There is noman can deem be my fey
If that it were departid equally
What lo this chorle lo how shrewdly
Unto my confessor to day he spak
I hold him certain a demonyak
Now ete your mete and let the chorl go pley
Let him go hang him self a devil wey
Now stood the lordis squier at his board
That carf his mete and herd word be word
Of all this thing of which I have you said
My lord quod he be not evil a paid
For I could tell for a gown cloth
To you sire friar so that ye be not wroth
How that this fart should even desid be
Among your covent if it like sithee
Tell quod the lord and thou shall have anon
A gown cloth be god and be saint John
My lord quod he when that the wedir is fair
Right here before you sittyng in a chair
Let bring a cartewhele right in to this halle
But so that it have his spokis all
Xij. spokis has a carte whele comynly
And bring me.xij. freris woot ye why
For.xiij. is a covent as I guess
Your confessor here for his wordynesse
Shall parfourme up the noumbir of his covent
Than shul they knele down by one assent
And to every spokis end in this manner
Full sadly ley his nose shall a frer^
Your nobyl confessor there (...) him save
Shall hold his nose upright under the naue
Than shall this chorle with belly styf and tought
As any ^abour hider be y brought
And set him on the wheel right of this cart
Up on the nau^ and make him l^te a fart
And ye shul se up peril of my lif
The preef which that is demonstratif
That equally the sound of it wol wend
And eke the stynk out at the spokis end
Save that this worthy man your confessor
Be caus^ he is a man of great honor
Shall have the first fruit as reason is
The nobil usage of freris yet it is
The worthie^t man of them shall first be seruid
And certainly he has it weel deseruid
He has to day taught us so much good
With prechinge in the pulpet there he stood
That I man vouchesauf I say for me
He had the first smell of fartis three
And so would al his covent hardely
He h^rith him so fair and so holily
The ^^rd the lady and each man save the friar
Said that Iankyn spak in this matere
As well as Ouyde or Ptholome
Towching the chorlis they said subtilite
And by wit made him speak as he spak
He nys no fool ne demoniak
And Iankyn has y won a new gown
My tale is done we be a (...) Town
Here begins the prolog of the clerk of Oxenford.
SIr clerk of Oxen^ord our ost said
Ye cryde as quoy and stille as does a maid
Were new sponsid sittyng at the board
This day herd I of your tunge no word
I trow ye stody about some sophyme
But Salamon said every thing has time
For goddis sake be of good chere
It is no time now to stody here
Tell us some merry tale be your fey
For what man is entrid in to a pley
He nedis moot in to the pley assente
But prechith not as freris do in lent
To make us for our old synnys weep
Ne that thy tale make us not to sleep
Tell us some merry thing of auenturis
Your termys your colors and your figuris
Keep hem in store til so be that ye endite
High style is when men to kyngis write
Spekith so plain at this time I you pray
That we may understand what ye say
This worthy clerk benignely ansuerde
Ost quod he I am under your yerde
Ye have of us as now the governance
And therefore I shall do your obeysaun^e
As fer as reason askith hardely
I wol you tell a tale which that I
Lernyd at Padow of a worthy clerk
As preuyd is he his wordis and his work
He is now ded and leyd in cheste
I pray to god give his soul good rest
Fraunceys petrark the laureat poet
Highte this clerk whoos rethorik sweet
Enlumyned al Itayle of poetry
As Lucane did of philosophy
Or law or other art particular
But death that wol not suffer us to duelle here
But as it were the twynkelyng of an ye
Hem both has slain and all shall we dye
But forth to tell of this worthy man
That taught me this tale as I began
He first with high style enditith
Er he the dite of his tale writith
A problem in which discriueth he
Pemounte and of Saluces the contre
And spekyn of arpentyn the hills hye
That been the bounds of west lumbardye
And of mount vesulus in special
Wh^re that the poo out of the well small
Taking his first spryngynge and his course
That Estward ever encresith in his sours
To Emeli ward to Ferrare and venise
The which a long thing were to deuyse
And trewly as to my Judgment
Me thinkith it a thing inpertinent
Save that he wol conueye his matere
But thus he begins his tale as ye mow here
Here endith the prolog. And begins the clerkis tale of Oxenforde
There was in the west side of Itayle
Down at the Rote of vesulus the cold
A lusty plain habundaunt of vitayl
Where meny a town and tour thou may behold
That founded were in time of fadris old
And meny another delectabyl sight
And saluces this noble contre hight
A Markys sometime lord was of that land
As were his worthy eldris him before
And obeysaunt ay ready to his hond
Were all his lieges both less and more
Thus in delyt he lyuyd and has do yore
Beloved and drad thorugh fauouris of fortune
Both of his lordis and eke of his comune
Therewith he was to speak of lynage
The gentilest baron of lumbardye
A fair person a strong and young of age
And full of honor and of curtesye
Discret ynow his contre forto gye
Save in some thingis he was to blame
And waltir was this young lordis name
I blame him thus that he considerid not
In time coming what might him betyde
But on his lust present was al his thought
As forto hawk and hunte on every side
Well nygh all other curis let he slide
And eke he nolde and that was worst of al
Wedde no wife for aught that might be fall
Only that point his pepyl baar so sore
That flekmele on a day they to him went
And one of hem that wisest was of lore
Or ellis that the lord would best assent
That he should tell him what his people meant
Or ellis could he show well such matere
He to the Markis said as ye shul here
O nobil Markis your humanite
Assurith us and yeueth us hardines
As often as time is of necessite
That we to you mow tell our heaviness
Acceptith now lord of your gentilnes
That we with pitous heart come to complain
And let your eris not my vois disdaigne
Al have I not to done in this matere
More than anothir man has in this place
Yet for as much as ye my lord so dear
Have alwey showed me favor and grace
I dar the bettir ask of you a space
Of audience to show our request
And ye my lord to do as you lest
For certis lord so well us likes you
And al your werk that ye have done and we
Ne could not our self deuisyn how
We might lyuyn in more felicite
Save o thing lord if your will be
That forto be a weddid man if that ye lest
Then were your pepyl in souereyn hertis rest
Bow ye your head under the blisful yok
Of souere^nte and not of seruise
Which that men clepith spousayle or wedlok
And thynkith lord among your wittis wise
How that our days passen in sundry wise
For though we sleep or wake run or ride
Ay fleyth the time it wol noman abide
And though your grene yongthe flower as yet
In crepith age as stylle as any stoon
And death manasseth ever age and smite
In each astate for there escapith noon
And also certain as we know echon
That we shul dye and uncertain we all
Been of the day when death shall on us fall
Acceptith than of us the true intent
That yet never refuseden your heste
And we wol lord if ye wol assent
Chese you a wife in short time at lest
Born of the gentillest and of the meste
Of all this land so that it ought seem
Honor to god and you as I can deem
Deliver us out of all this besy dread
And take a wife for high goddis sake
For if so be it besalle as god forbede
That through your death your life should slake
And that a strange successor should it take
Your heritage o woe were us on live
Wherefore we pray you hastily to wyue
Here meke prayer and ^^re meke chere
Made the Markis heart forto have pity
Ye wol quod he mine owen pepyl dear
To that I never erst thought constreyne me
I me reioysid in my liberte
That selde time is found in marriage
There I was fre I must be in seruage
But natheles I se your true intent
And trust upon your wit and have done ay
Wherefore of my fre will I will assent
To wedde me as soon as ever y may
But there as ye have profrid me to day
To chese me a wife I you relece
That chois and pray you of your profir sec^
For god it woot that childryn often been
Vnlik her worthy eldris hem before
Beauty comyth al of god not of the streen
Of which they be gendrid and y bore
I trust in god and ever have do by fore
My marriage and mine astate and rest
I him betake he may do as him lest
Let me allone in chesing of my wife
That charge up on my bak y wol endure
But I you pray and charge upon your l^f
What wife that y take that ye me ensure
To worshipe her whylis her lif may dure
In word and werk both here and eueriwhere
As she an Emperors daughter were
And ferthermore this shall ye swear that ye
Against my chois shall ye never strive
For since I shall forgo my liberte
At your request as ever mot I thrive
There as my heart is set there wol y wyue
And but ye wol assente in such manner
I pray you spekith no more of this matere
With herty will they sworyn and assentyn
To all this thing there said no wight nay
Besekyng him of grace or that they wentyn
That he would grant hem a certain day
Of his sponsayll as soon as ever he may
For yet alwey many of the pepyl dredde
Lest the Markis would no wife wedde
He grauntid hem a day such as him lest
On which he would be weddid sikirly
And said he did all this at her request
And they with humble intent buxomly
Kneling up on her knees full reverently
Him thankid all and thus they have an end
Of here intent and hoom ayeen they wend
And here up on he took his officers
And comaundid for the feste purueye
And to his pryue knyghtis and squieris
Such charge yaf as him list on hem leye
And they to his commandment obey
And each of hem does al his diligence
To do unto that feste high reverence
.Prima pars Grisildis.
Naught fer fro that paleis honorable
There as this Markis shoop his marriage
There stood a thorp of sight full delectable
In which that pour folk of that village
Hadden her lestis and her herbigage
And of her labor took her sustenaunce
Aftir that the earth yaf hem haboundaunce
Among these pour men there duellid a man
Which was y hold pourest of all
But high god sometime send can
In to a litil oxes stalle
Ianycola men of that throwpe him call
A daughter had he fair enough to sight
And Grisilde this young maiden hight
Forto speak of virtue and of honest beauty
Than was she on of the fairest under son
And full pouerly y fostrid up was she
No licorous lust was thorou her heart y run
But ofter of the well than of the wyn tonne
She drank and for she would virtue plese
Hit was her list and her most ese
But though this maid so tendir were of age
Yet in the breast of her virginite
There was y closid ri^e and sad courage
And in great reverence and charity
Her old pour fader fostrid she
A few sheep spynnynge on feld she kept
She would not be ydil til she slep^e
And when she homward com she would bring
Wortis or other herbis times often
The which she setheth for her living
And made her bed hard and nothing soft
And ay she kept her fadres lif on lofte
With obe^saunce and diligence
That child might do to the fadris reverence
Up on Grisilde this pour creature
Fill of this Markis he cast his ye
As he wod on hunting perauenture
And when it be fyl that he might here aspye
He not with wantoun lokyng of folly
His yen cast on her but in sad wise
Up on her chere he would him often auyse
Com^endynge in his heart her woman head
And eke her virtue passing any wight
Of so young age as well in chere as deed
For though the pepyl had no great insight
He considered in virtue full right
Her beauty and disposid him that he would
Wedde her only if he euyr wedde should
The day of weddyng came but no wight can
Tell what manner woman it should be
For which meruayl wondrid many a man
And said when they were in priuyte
Wol our lord live yet in vanite
Wol he not wedde allas the while
Why wol he him self and us begyle
But natheles this Markis had do make
Of gemmys set in gold and in asure
Brochis and ringis for grisildis sake
And to her clothing took the mesure
Of a maid lik unto her stature
And eke of her other ornamentis all
That unto such a weddinge should be fall
The time of vndryn on the same day
Approchid that the weddinge should be
And all the Paleis put was in array
Both halle and chambris each in his degree
Housis of office stuffid with greet plente
There may thou se of deynteous vitaylle
That may befounden as for as lastith I tail
This ryal Markis richely araid
Lordis and ladies in his company
The which that to the feste were praid
And of his retem^ the buchelrye
With many a sown of sundry melodye
Unto the vilage of which I told
In this array the right wey they hold
Grisilde of this god woot full Innocent
That for her shapyn was all this array
To fecte watir at well is she went
And comyth hoom as soon as ever she may
For well she herd say that ilke day
Tha^ the Markis should wedde and if she might
She would feign have seyn some of that sight
She thought she would with other maidens stand
That been my fellows in our door and se
The Markesse and therefore wol I fond
To done at hoom as soon as it may be
The labor which longs to me
And than y may at leyser here behold
If she this wey unto the castle hold
And as she would over the thresshold goon
The Markis came and began her forto call
And she set down her wat^r pot anon
Besidis the threshold in an oxis stalle
And down up on her knees she began to fall
And with sad contenaunce knelid stylle
Til she had herd what was the lordis will
This thoughtful Markis spak unto the maid
Full sobirly and said in this manner
Where is your fadir o Grisildis he said
And she with reu^rence and humble chere
Answerde lord he is al ready here
And in she goth withouten lengir let
And to the Markis she her fader fet
He by the hond than took this old man
And said thus when he had him a side
Ianycula I ne may ne I ne can
The plesaunce longer of my heart hyde
If that thou vouchesauf that so betyde
Thy daughter wol I take or that I wend
As to my wife unto our lyuys end
Thou love me I woot it well certain
And art my feithful liege man bore
And all that likith me I dar well sayn
It likith the and specially therefore
Tell me that point that I said before
And if thou wolt unto that purpos draw
To take me as for thy sone in law
This sodeyn caas this man was stoned so
That reed he wext abasshid and al quak^ng
He stood uneath said he wordis mo
But only thus lord quod he my willing
Is as ye will not ageyns your likynge
I wol no thing / ye be my lord so dear
Right as you list gouernyth this matere
Yet wol I quod this Markis softely
That in your chambir I ye and she
Have a collacion and wotist thou why
For I wol axe if it here will be
To be my wife and reule her aftir me
And all this shall be do in thy presence
I nyl not speak out of thyn audience
And in the Chambir while they were about
Her tretees which ye shall as after here
The p^pyl came in to the house al without
And wondrid hem in how honest manner
And she so tentifly kept her fader dear
But utterly Grisilde wondre might
For never erst saw she such a sight
No wonder it was though she were stoned
To se so greet a gest come in that place
She never was to such gestis y woned
For which she lokid with full paal face
But shortly this matter forto chase
These ben the wordis that the Markis said
To this verry benign feithful maid
Grisilde he said ye shulle well understand
It likith unto your fader and unto me
That I you wedde and eke it may so stand
As I suppose that ye will that it so be
But these demaundis axe I first quod he
That since it shall be done in hasty wise
Wol ye assent or ellis you auyse
I say thus be ye ready with good heart
To al my lust and that I freely may
As me best thinkith though ye lawghe or smerte
And never ye to grucche night ne day
When I say ye that ye say not ones nay
Nothir be word ne by frownyng contenance
Swear this and I you here assure affiaunce
Wondering up on these wordis wonderly for dr^de
She said lord indigne and unworthy
I am to ^uche honor as ye me bid
But as ye will your self right so will I
And here I swear that never willyngly
In word or thought I wol you disobeye
Forto be ded though me were loath to deye
This is enough Grisilde mine quod he
And forth he goth with a full sobir chere
Out at door and aftir came she
And to the pepyl he said in this manner
This is my wife quod he that stondeth here
Honourith her and louith her I you pray
Who so me louith there is no more to say
And for that no thing of her old geer
She should bring in to his house he had
That women should dispoyle here there
Of which these ladies were not full glad
To handel her clothis where in she was ^lad
But natheles this maid bright of hew
Fro foot to head they clothid her new
Her heris they kempt that lay vntressid
Full rudely and with her fyngris small
A croune on her head they have y dressid
And set her full of owches great and small
Of here array what should I make a tale
Uneath the pepyl her knew for her fairnes
When she translatid was in such riches
This markis has her spousid with a ryng
Brought for the same cause and than her set
Up on an horse snow white full well amblyng
And to his Paleis or he lengir let
With joyful pepil that her ladde and met
Conveyed her and thus the day they spend
In revel til the son began descend
And shortly forth this tale forto chase
I say that to this new Markesse
God has such favor sent of his grace
That it ne semyd be no liklynes
That she was born and fed in rudenes
As in a cite or in an oxis stalle
But norisshed in an Emperors halle
To every wight she woxen is so dear
And worshipful that folk there she was bore
And from her birthe knew her year by year
Uneath trowed they but durst have swore
That to Ianycul of which I spak before
She deughter was as by conjecture
Hem thought she was anothir creature
For that ever virtuous was she
She was encrecid in such excellence
Of the wise god set in high bounte
And so discreet and feir of eloquence
So benign and digne of reverence
And could so the peplis hertis enbrace
That each her loved that lokid in her face
Not only of Saluces in the town
Publisshed was the bounte of her name
But eke beside in many a regioun
If one said well another said the same
So spredde of her bounte the name
That men and women both young and old
Goth to Saluces up on her to be hold
This walter lowly but not rially
Weddid has with fortunat honest
In goddis pees liuyth full honestly
At hoom and outward grace enough had he
And for he saw that under low degree
Was honest virtue hid the pepyl him held
A prudent man and that is seen full selde
Not only this Grisilde through her wit
Could all the feet of wifly humbilnes
But yet when that the ^as requiryd it
The comune proffit eke could she redress
There nas discord rancour ne heaviness
In all the land that she it could a pees
And wisely bring hem in rest and pee^
Though her husbonde were absent or none
If gentilmen or other of that contre
Were wroth she would bring hem atone
So wise and ripe wordis had she
And in Judgment so greet equity
That she from heuyn sent was as men wend
Pepil to save and every wrong to amend
Not long time aftir that this Grisilde
Was weddid she a daughter had y bore
Al had her leuyr bore a knave child
Glad was the Marks and the folk therefore
For though amayde child came al before
S^e may unto a knave child atteyne
Be liklihede syn she nys not bareyne
.Secunda pars.
There fill as it befallith often time mo
When tht this child had sokyn but a throw
This markis in his heart he thought so
To tempte his wife her sadness to know
That he ne might out of his heart athrowe
Forbere / wherefore he purposid on a day
This maruaylous desire his wife to assaye
He had assaid here enough often time before
And fond her ever good what nedith it
Her forto tempte alwey more and more
Though sum man preyse it for a subtle wit
But as for me y say full evil it sit
To assay a wife when that it is no ned^
And put her in angwish and in dread
For which this markis wroughte in this manner
He came a lone a night there as she lay
With stern face and right ogly chere
And said thus Grisilde quod he that day
That I you took fro your pour a ray
And put you in astaat of high noblesse
Ye have not that forgotyn as I guess
I say Grisilde the present dignite
In which I have put you as I trow
Makith you not foryetful forto be
That I you took i^ pour astat fullowe
For any weel ye must your self know
Take heed of every word what I seye
There is no wight that herith but we twey
Ye woot y^^r self how that ye came here
In to this house it is not long ago
And though to me ye be both leef and dear
Unto my gentiles ye be no thing so
They say to hem it is great shame and woo
Forto be subject and been in seruage
To the that born art in so small a vilage
And namely s^th thy daughter was y bore
These words have they spoken doutlees
But I desire as I have don before
To live my lif with hem in rest and pees
I may not in this a^as be recheles
I moot done with thy daughter for the best
Not as I would but as my pep^l lest
And yet god woot this is full loath to me
But natheles without your witynge
I will not do but thus I wol quod he
That ye to me assente as to this thing
S^^w now your patience in your werkynge
That ye me highte and swoor in your village
That day that made was our marriage
When she had herd all this she not ameuyd
Neither in word neither in chere ne in continance
For as it semyd she was not agreuyd
She says lord al lies in your plesaunce
My child and I with hertly obeyssaunce
Been your owen and ye may both save and spille
Your owen thing do ye aftir your will
There may be no thing so god my soul save
Likyng to you that may displese me
Ne I desire no thing in any wise to have
Ne dr^de forto lose save only ye
This will is in mine heart and ever shall be
No length of time or death may this deface
Ne turn my courage to noon other place
^lad was this Markis of her answeringe
But yet it semyd as he were not so
Al dr^^y was his chere and his lokyng
When that he should out of the chambir go
Sone aftir this a furlong wey or two
He privily has told al his intent
Unto a man and to his wife him sent
A manner of a serg^aunt was this privy man
The which that f^ithful oftyn found had
In thingis great and eke such folk well can
Done execucioun in thingis sad
The lord knew weel that he him louyd and drad
And when this seric^unt wiste his lordis will
In to the chambir he stalkid him full stylle
Madame he said ye moot forgive it me
Though I do thing which I am constreyned
Ye be full wise and full well know ye
That lordis hestis may not be feigned
They may weel be bewaylid or compleyned
But men must need unto her lust obey
And so wol I there is no more to sey
This child I am comandid forto take
And spak no more but out the child he hent
Dispitously and began a chere full hidons to make
As though he would have sleyn it or he went
Gresilde must al suffer and consent
And as a lamb she sittith meke and stylle
And let this cruel seriaunt do his will
Suspecions was the fame of this man
Suspect his face suspect his word also
Suspect the time in which he this began
Allas her daughter that she louyd so
She wend he would have sleyn it tho
But natheles she neither wept ne siked
Confermyd to that the Markis likid
But at the last speak then she began
And mekely she to the seriaunt prayde
So as he was a very gentilman
That she must her child kiss onys or it deid^
And in her arm she the litil child leyde
With full sad face and g^n the child to blis
And lullid it and aftir began it kiss
And thus she said in her benign vois
Farwell my child I shall the never se
But since I have the markid with the holy crois
Of thilke fader blissed moot thou be
That for us deide upon the cross of tree
Thy soul litil child I him betake
For this night shall thou dye for my sake
I trow that to a norice in this caas
It ^adde be great rowthe forto se
Well might a mother than have cride allas
But natheles so sad and so steadfast was she
That she endurid al aduersite
And to the seriaunt mekely she said
Have here again your litil young maid
Gooth now quod she and does my lordis heste
But o thing wol I pray you of your grace
That but my lord forbad it you at lest
Burieth this litil body in some place
That bestis ne foulis it to raze
But he to that purpos no word would say
But took the child and went up on his way
This seriaunt came to the lord again
And of Grisil^is wordis and of her chere
He told him point by point short and pleyn
And him presentid with his daughter dear
Sumwhat this lord has rowthe in his manner
But natheles his purpos h^ld ^e stylle
As lordis done when they will have her will
And had his seriaunt that he privily
Should the child soft wind and wrappe
With all the circumstaunce tendirly
And carye it in a cofir or in a lap
But on pain of his head of forto swappe
That noman should know of this enten^
Ne whens it came ne whithir that it w^nt
But at boleyn to his sustir dear
That ilke time of Pauye was Countes
He should it take and show her this matere
Besekyng here to do her besinesse
This child to fostir in all gentilnes
And whoos child that it is he had him hyde
From every wight for aught that may betyde
The seriaunt goth and has fulfilled this thing
But to this Markis now return we
Full now goth he full fast Imagenynge
If be his wives chere he might se
Or by her word perceive that she
Were chaungid but never yet could he find
But ever in on lik sad and kind
As glad as humbil as besy in seruise
And eke in love as she was wont to be
Was she to him in every manner wise
Ne of her daughter not oword spak she
Non accident for non aduersite
Was seyn in her ne never her daughter name
Ne nempned she in ernest ne in game
.Tercia pars.
IN this astat there past be four y^er
Er she with child was but as god would
A man child she baar be this walter
Full gracious and feir forto behold
And when that folk it to his fadir told
Not only he but al his contre merry
Was for this child and god they thank and hery
When it was two year old and fro the breast
D^artid from his norice up on a day
This Markis caughte yet anothir lest
To tempte his wife yet ofter if he may
Vnnedeles was she temptid in assay
But weddid men can no mesure
When that they find a pacient creature
Wife quod this Markis ye have herd this
My pepil berith heavy sikirly our marriage
And namely since my sone I born is
Now it is wors than ever in all our age
The murmur sleth mine heart and my courage
For to mine ^eris comyth the vois so smerte
That it full nygh destroid has mine heart
Now say they thus when walter is agoon
Than shall the blood of Ianicula succeed
And be our lord for other have we noon
Such wordis says my people out of dread
Well ought I of such murmur take heed
For certainly I dread such sentence
Though they not pleyne in mine audience
I would live in pees if that I might
Wherefore I am disposid full vttirly
As I his sustir served be night
Right so think I to serve him privily
This warn I you that ye not suddenly
Out of your self for no woe should affraye
Be pacient and there of I you pray
I have quod she said thus and ever shall
I wol no thing in no manner certain
But as you list nothing greuith me at al.
Though that my daughter and my sone be slain
At your commandment this is forto sayn
I have had no part of children tweyn
But first seeknes and aftir woo and pe^n^
Ye been our lord / does with your owen thing
Right as you list axeth no leave of me
For as I left at hoom al my clothinge
When I came first to you right so quod she
Left I my will and al my liberte
And took your clothinge wherefore I you pray
Does your plesaunce I will your lust obey
And certis if I h^dde any prescien^e
Your will to know or ye your lust me told
I would it do without negligence
But now I woot your lust and w^a^ ^e would
Al your plesaunce ferm and stabil I ^ol^e
For wiste I that my death might do you ese
Right gladly would I dye you to please
Death may not make no manner of comparison
Unto your love / and when this Markis say
The constaunce of his wife he cast a down
His yen two and wondrid that she may
In patience suffir all this manner array
And forth he goth with drery contenaunce
But to his heart it was full great plesaunce
This vgle seriaunt in the same wise
That ^^r daughter caughte right so he
Or wors if men can wors deuyse
Has hent her sone that full is of beauty
And ever in one so pacient was she
That she no chere of heaviness
But lust him sone and aftir began him bles
Save this she prayde him if that he might
Her litil sone he would in the earth grave
His tendir lymes delicat in sight
Fro foulis and fro bestis it to save
But she non other answer of him might have
He ^ente his wey as he no thing thought
But to boleyne he it tenderly brought
This Markis wondered ever longer the more
Upon her patience and that she
Had not know sothly therefore
That parfitly her children loved she
He would have wend of some subtilte
And of malice and for cruel courage
That she had suffrid this with sad visa^e
But weel he knew that next him self cer^eyn
She louyd her children lest in every wise
But now of women would I axe full feyn
If these assayes might not suffyse
What could a sturdy husbonde more deuyse
To preue her wifhood or her stedfastnes
And he contym^ynge ever in his sturdynes
But there ben folk of such manner condition
And so wilful such assayes to make
That can not stynte of here entencion
But right as they were boundyn to a stake
They wol not of her first purpos slake
Right so this Markis has fully purposid
To tempte his wife as he was first disposed
He waytid as if be word or contenaunce
That she to him was chaungid of courage
But never could he find any variaunce
She was ay in on heart and in visage
And the ferther that she was in age
The more true if it were possibil
She was to him and the more plesibill
For which it semyd thus that of ^em two
There was but on will for but as walter lest
The same lust was her plesaunce also
And god bethankid al fyl for the best
She shewde weel for non wordly vnreste
A wife as of her self no thing ne should
Will in effect but as her husbond would
The slander of Walter wonder wide spradde
That of cruel heart he full wickidly
For he a pour woman weddid had
Has murdrid both his childryn privily
Such murmur was among hem comynly
No wonder is for to the peplis ere
There came no word but that they murdrid were
For which there as the pepil there before
Had louid him well the skandre of his defame
Made hem that him they hatid therefore
To be a murdrer is an hateful name
But natheles for ernest or for game
He of his cruel purpos would not stynte
To tempte his wife was al his intent
When that his daughter.xij. year was of age
He in to the court of rome in subtle wise
Enfourm^d of his will sent his message
Comaundinge hem such bullis to deuyse
As to his cruel purpoos may suffice
How that the Pope bad as for his peplis rest
That he should wedde anothir wife if he list
I say he bad he should countirfete
The Popis bull is making mention
That he has leave his first wife forto let
As by the Popis owen dispensacion
To stynte the rancour of disc^nsion
Between his pepil and him this said the bulle
The which they have publisshed at fulle
The rude pepil as no wonder ne is
Wend full w^el that it had be right so
But when these tidyngis came to Grisildis
I deem that the heart of here was full woo
But she y lik sad was euermo
Disposid was this humbyl creature
The aduersite of fortune al to endure
Abidynge ever his lust and his plesaunce
To whom that she was yeuen heart and al
As to his verry wordly sufficiaunce
But shortly if I this story tell shall
This Ma^kis written has in special
A lettir in which he shewith his intent
And secretly to boleyne he has it sent
To the earl of Pauye which had tho
Weddid his suster / prayde him specially
To bring hom aycen his children two
In honorable staat al openly
But o thing he him prayde entierly
That he no wight though they did enquere
Should not tell whoos children that they were
But say the maid shall weddid be
Unto the Markis of Saluces anon
And as this earl was prayed so did he
For at day set he on his wey is goon
And forth he rood hastly and that anoon
Toward Saluce this maid forto gyde
Here young brothir ridyng be her side
Araid was toward her marriage
This fressh may full of gemmys clear
Her brother which.vij. y^er was of age
Araid full fresh in her manner
And thus with great noblesse and glad chere
Toward Saluces spedyng her iournay
Fro day to day they riden in her way
.Quarta pars.
AMong all this aftir his wicked usage
This Markis is yet about to tempte more
The vtterest preef of her courage
Fully to have experience and lore
If she were as steadfast as before
He on a day in open audience
Full boistously has said here this sentence
Certis Gresilde I had I now of plesaunce
To have you to my wife for your goodness
As for your truth and your obeysaunce
Not for your lynage ne for your riches
But now know I in verry sothfastnes
That in great lordship if I me wol auyse
Th^r is great seruytut in sundry wise
I may not do as every plowman may
My p^pyl constreyneth me forto take
Anothir wife and cryen day be day
And eke the peplis ran^our forto slake
Concentith it that dar I well undertake
And trewly thus much^ I wol you say
Mine new wife is coming be the way
Be strong of heart and void a non her place
And that dower that ye brought me
Takith it again I give you leave of my grace
Retourneth to your fadris house quod he
No man may alwey have prosperyte
With even heart I read you to endure
The struck of fortune or of adventure
And she again answerde in patience
My lusty lord quod she I woot and wiste alwey
How that betwixt your magnificence
And my pouerte no wight can ne may
Make any comparison it is no nay
I ne held me never digne in no manner
To be your wife neither your chamberere
And in this house there ye me lady made
The high god take I for witness
And also wisly he my soul glade
I neuyr held me lady ne maistres
But humble servant to your worthynes
And ever shall while my lif may endure
Abouen every wordly creature
That ye have so long of your benignite
Hold me in high nobles and honourey
There as I was not worthy forto be
That thank I god to whom I prey
Foryelde it you there is no more to sey
Unto my fader gladly wol I wend
And with him duelle to my liuys end
There as I was forstrid of a child full small
Till I be ded my lif there wol I led
A widow cleen in body heart and al
For seth I yaf to you my maydenhede
I am your true wife it is no dread
God shilde ^uche a lordis wife to take
Another husbond or any man to make
And of your new wife god of his grace
So he grant you weel and presperite
For I wol gladly yield her my plac^
In which I was blesful wont to be
For since it likes you my lord quod she
That some time were al my hertis rest
That y shall goon I wol go when ye lest
But there as ye me profre such dowere
As I first brought it is well in my mind
It were my wre^chid clothis no thing feir
The which to me now were hard to find
O good god / how gentil and how kind
Ye semyd by your speech and your visage
The day that maad was our marriage
But soth is said alwey I find it true
For in effect ypreuyd it is on me
Love is not old as when it is n^we
But certis lord for non aduersite
To dye in this caas it shall not be
That ever in word or werk I shall repent
That I you give my heart in hool intent
My lord ye woot that in my fadres place
Ye did me stripe out of my pour wede
And richely ye me c^ad of your grace
To you brought y naught ellis out of dread
But feith nakidnes and my maydenhede
And here ayeen my clothing I restore
And eke my weddyng ryng for evermore
The remenaunt of your jewel is ready they be
With ynne your chamber I dar it safly seyn
Nakid out of my fadres house quod she
I came and nakid must I turn ayeen
Al your plesaunce follow would I feyn
But yet I hope it be not your intent
That I smokles out of your paleis went
Ye could not do so dishonest a thing
That ilke womb in which your children lay
Should before the pepyl in my walkyng
Be seye albare wherefore I you pray
Let me not lik a worm go by the wey
Remember you mine owen lord so dear
I was your wife though I unworthy were
Wherefore in guerdom of my maydenhede
Which that I brought and not again y bear
As vouchesauf as give me to my mede
But such a smok as I was wont to were
That I therewith may wrye the womb of here
That was your wife and here I take my leave
Of you mine owen lord leest that I you grieve
The smok quod he that thou have up on thy ba^
Let it be stylle and bear it forth with the
But well uneath that word he spak
But went his wey for routhe and pity
Be for the folk her self striped has she
And in her smok with foot and here al bare
Toward her fadris house is she fare
The folk her folowyn weeping in her wey
And fortune ever they cursid as they goon
But she fro weeping kept her yen dreye
Ne in this time word spak she noon
Her fadir that these tidinges herd anon
Cursid the day and the time that nature
Shoop him to be a lyuys creature
For out of doubt this old pour man
Was ever suspect of her marriage
For ever he demyd since it began
That when the lord had fulfild his courage
He would think it were a disparage
To his astat so low to light
And vo^den her as soon as ever he might
Ayens his daughter hastily goth he
For h^ b^ noise of folk knew her coming
And with her old cote as it might be
He keuerid her full soroufully weeping
But on her body might he it not bring
For rude was the cloth and she more of age
Be days feel than was her marriage
Than with her fader for a certain spaas
Duellid this flour of wifly patience
That never by her word ne by her face
Beforn the folk ne in her absence
Ne shewde she that her was done offense
Ne of her high astat no remembraun^e
Ne had she as by any manner contenaunce
No wonder was for in her great astat
Her ghost was ever in pleyn humy^^te
No tender mouth ne heart delicaat
No pomp ne semblaunce of rialte
But full of pacient benignite
Discreet and prideles and ay honourabil
And ay to her husbond meke and stabil
Men speak of Job and most for his humbles
As clerkis when hem list can well endite
Namely of men but in sothfastnes
Though clerkis preyse women but alite
There can noman in humbles hem aquyte
As woman can ne can be half so true
As women ben but it be fall of new

ERo Boleyne this earl of Pauye came
Of which the fante sprung both more and less
And in the peplis eris al and some
Was told that he a new Markesse
With him brought in such pomp^ and riches
That never was seye with mannys ye
So ryal a sight in all westlumbardye
The Markis which that shope and knew all this
Or that this earl was come sent his message
For that sely pour creature the Marquess
And she with humble heart and glad visage
Not with no swellyng thought in her courage
Came at his heste and on her knees her set
And reverently and wisly she him g^et
Grisilde quod he my will is full entierly
This maiden that weddid shall be to me
Rec^yued be to morrow al so rially
As it is possible in my house to be
And eke that every wight in his degree
Have his astaat in sittinge and in seruise
And hye plesaunce as ye can best deuyse
I have no woman sufficiaunt certain
The chambris forto array in ordenaunce
Aftir my list and therefore would I feign
That ^h^n were al such manner of governance
Thou know eek of old al my plesaunce
Th^ugh thyn array be badde and evil be seye
Do thy deuoyr yet at the least w^y
Not only lord that I am glad quod she
To do ^our lust but I desire also
You first to please and serve in my degree
Without fayntynge and shall ever mo
Ne for no weel ne for no manner of woe
Ne shall ye ghost with in my heart stynte
To love you best with all my true entent^
And with that word she began the house to dighte
And tab^is forto set and beddis forto make
And peyned here to do all that she might
Prayynge the chamberers for goddis sake
To haste hem and fast swepe and shake
And she the m^ste seruisabil of all
Has eu^ry chambir araid and eke his halle
About the vndryn began this earl to light
That with him brought thise nobil child^in twey
For which the pepyl ran to se that sight
Of here array mightily they were beseye
And than among hem all they seye
That Waltir was no fool though that him list
To change his wife for it was for the best
For she is fairer as they demyn all
Than is Grisilde and more tendir of age
And fairer fruit between hem shall fall
And more plesaunce for her high lynage
Her brothir eke so fair of visage
That hem to se the pepyl has caught plesaunce
Comendynge now the Markis governance
O sturdy pepyl ever vnsad and untrue
Ay indiscreet and chaungynge as a vane
Here may ye se the people how new
Ay full of clappinge dear ynow a Jane
And changeable be right as the mane
Your dome is false your constaunce evil preuyth
A full great fool is he that on you leuith
Thus sayden sad foll^ in that cite
When that the pepyl gadrid up and down
For they were glad right for the newelte
To have a new lady of her town
No More of this now make I mention
But to Gris^lde ageyn I will me dres
And tell here constaunce and her besine
Full besi was Gresilde in every thing
That to the feste was tho appertinent
Right naught was she abasshid of her clothinge
Though it were rude and somdele eke to rent
But with clad chere to the yate is she went
With other folk to great the Markeses
And aftir does forth her besynes
With right glad chere she his gestis received
And so connyngly each in his degree
That no defaute noman perceived
But ay they wondrid what she might be
That in so pour array was forto se
And could such honor and reverence
And worthyly they preysen her prudence
In all this mean while she ne stynt
This maid and eek her brother to comende
With all her heart in full benign intent
So well that noman could her presing amend
But at last when that lordis wend
To sictyn down to mete he began to call
Grisilde as she was besy in the halle
Grisilde quod he as it were in his pley
How likith the my wife and her beauty
Right well my lord quod she for in good fey
A fairer saw I never than is she
I prey to god give her good prosperyte
And so hope I he will to you send
Plesaunce ynow unto your lives end
O thing y beseech you and warn also
That ye not prik with no turmentrye
This tendir maid as ye have do mo
For she is sostrid in her norisshinge
More tenderly and to my supposinge
She could not aduersite well endure
As could a pour fostrid creature
And when this walter saw her patience
Her glad chere and no malice at al
And he so often had do to her offense
And she ay constant and sad as a wall
Contynuynge ever here Innocence over all This sturdy Markis began his heart dress
To rewe up on her wifly stedfastnes
This is ynow Grisilde mine quod he
Be now no more aghast ne evil a paid
I have thy feith and thy benignite
As well as ever woman was a said
In great astat or pouerly araid
Now know I dear wife thy stedfastnes
And here in armies took and began her kiss
And she for wonder took of him no kep^
She herd not what thing be to her said
She farid as she had stert out of her slep^
Til she out of her masidnes abreyde
Grisilde quod he be god that for us deyde
Thou art my wife non other I have
Ne never I had as god my soul save
This is thy daughter which thou have supposid
To be my wife that other feithfully
Shall be mine heir as I have disposid
Thou baar him in thy body full trewly
At boleyne have I kept hem privily
Take hem ayeen for now may thou not sey
That thou have lorn none of thy childryn twey
And folk that other wise have said by me
I warn hem well that I have don this deed
For no malice ne for no cruelte
But forto assay in the thy womanhede
And not to sle my childryn god forbede
But forto keep hem privily and stille
Til I thy purpos knew and al thy will
When she this herd in swonnyng down she fallith
For pitous joy and aftir her swonnyng
She to her both here young childryn callith
And in her armies full petously weeping
Enbraced hem and tenderly kissinge
Full lik amodir with salt teris
She badith both her visage and her eris
O which a pitous thing it was to se
Her swonn^nge and her pitous vois to here
Grant mercy lord / god thank it you quoth she
That ye have saved me my childryn dear
Now recke I neuyr to be ded even here
Since y stand in your love and in your grace
No doubt of death ne when my spirit pace
O tender o dear o young childryn mine
Your woeful mother w^de full steadfastly
That cruel houndis or some foul venym
Had etyn you but god of his mercy
And your benign fader so tenderly
Has done you keep and in that same stounde
Al suddenly she swapt down to g^ounde
And in her swoune so sadly holdith she
Her childryn two when she began him brace
That with greet sleyghte and greet difficulte
The childryn from here arm gone they race
O many a tere of many a pitous face
Down ran of hem that stodyn there beside
Uneath about here might they abide
Walter her gladith and her sorrow slakith
She risith up and basshith from her trance
And every wight her joy and feste makith
Til she has caught ayeen her contenaunce
Walter does her so feithful plesaunce
That it was deynte to se the chere
Between hem two syn they be met in fere
These ladies when they her time sey
Have takyn here and in to chambir anon
And stripen here out of her rude array
And in a cloth of gold that bright shoon
With a croune o^ ^any a rich stoon
Up on her head in to the halle they brought
And there she was honored as she ought
Thus has this pitous day a blisful end
For every man and woman does his might
This day in mirthe and revel to spend
Til on the welkyn shoon the ste^ys light
For more solempnyte in every mannys sight
This ^este was and of gretter costage
Than was the revel of her marriage
Full many a year in high prosperity
Lyuen these two in concord and in rest
And richely his daughter married he
Unto a lord on of the worthiest
Of al Itail and than in pees and rest
His wyuys fader in his court he kepith
Til the soul out of the body crepith
His sone succedith in his heritage
In rest and pees aftir his fadris day
And fortunat was eke in marriage
Al put he not his wife in great assaye
This world is not so strong it is no nay
As it has been in old times yore
And h^rkith what this auctor says therefore
This stor^ is said not for that wyuys should
Follow Grisilde as in high humylyte
For it were importabil though they would
But f^r that every wight in his degree
Should be constant in all aduersite
As was Grisilde wh^rfore Petrark writith
This story which with high style enditith
For since a woman was so pacient
Unto a mortal man well more we ought
Receyuen al in good that god us sent
For great skillis I preue that he wrought
But he ne temptid noman that he bought
As says saint Iame if ye his pistil read
He preuyth folk but a day it is no dread
And suffrith us as for our exercise
With sharp scorgis and aduersite
Full often to be beat in sundry wise
Not forto know our will but certis he
Er we were born knew al our freelte
And for our best is al his governance
Let us live than in virtuous suffraunce
But o word harkenyth lordingis or I go
It were full hard to find now a days
Grisildis in all a contre on or two
For if they were put to such assayes
The gold of hem has so badde a lays
With bras for though it be fair at ye
It would rathir breast on two than plye
For which here for the wyuys love of Bathe
Whoos life and sect mighty god mayntene
In high maistrie or ellis were it s^athe
I wol with lusty heart fresh and grene
Sey you a song to glade you I w^^e
And leet us stynte of ernest matere
Herkeneth my song that says in this man^re
GRisilde is ded and eek her patience
And both at onys buried in Itayle
For which I cry in open audience
No weddid man so hardy be to assail
His wyuys patience in trust to find
Grisildis for certain he shall fail
O nobil wyuys full of prudence
Leet non humylite your tungis nail
Ne let no clerk ^oue c^use or diligence
To write of you a story of such meruay^
As of Grisilde pacient and kind
Lest cheuache you swalow in entrail
Felowith e^ro that holdith no silence
But euyr answeringe at countirtayl
Be not a daffid for your Innocence
But sharply take on you the gouernayl
Enpryntith well that lesson in your mind
For common profit seith it may auaylle
Ye archewyuys stondith at defense
Syn ye be strong as is a great Camaylle
Ne suffer not that men do you offense
But sklender wyuys as febil in battle
Beth ^gre as a tigre is / fer in ynde
Ay clappinge as a mylle I you counsayl
Ne dredith hem not do hem no reverence
For though thy husbond armed be in mayl
Thy wordis of thy crabbed eloquence
Shall perse his breast and eke his auentayl
In Jealousy I read eke that thou him bind
And thou shall make him cowche as a quayl
If thou be fair there folk been in presence
Show thou thy visage and thyn apparaylle
If thou be foul be fre of thy despence
To get the frendis ay do thy trauaylle
Be ay of chere as light as leef on lynde
And leet him care weep wrynge and wayl
Verba hospitis.
THis worthy clerk when endid was his tale
Our oste said and swoor be cockis bonys
Me were lever than a barel of ale
My wife had herd this legende onys
This is a gentil tale for the nonys
As to my purpos wyste ye my will
But thing that will not be let it be still
Here endith the tale of the clerk of Oxenforde And begins the Frankeleynes
prolog.
THese old gentil britons in her da^es
Of diverse auctours maden her lays
Rymed first in her owen briton tunge
Such lays with her instrumentis they sunge
Or ellis reddyn hem for her plesaunce
And on of hem have I in remembrance
Which I shall say with as good will as I can
Bert sires be cause I am a borel man
At my beginning first I you beseech
Have me excusid of my rude speech
I lernyd never rethorik in certain
Thing that I speak must be bare and pleyn
I slepte never in the mount of pernaso
Ne learned Mara^s Tullius ne Cit^ero
Colowris know I noon withouten dread
But such colouris as grown in the mede
Or ellis such as men dien or peynte
Colors of rethorik be to me queynte
My spirit felith in no such matere
But and ye list my tale shul ye here
Here endith the Frankeleyns prolog And here begins his tale.
IN armorik that callid ^is Britayne
There was a knight the louid and deed his pain
To serve ladies in his best wise
And many a labor and meny a great empryse
He for his lady wrought or she was won
For she was on the fairest under son
And eke thereto common of high kynrede
That well uneath durst the knight for dread
Tell here his woe or pain or disires
But a^te last she for his worthynes
And namely for his meke obeyssaunce
Has such appetit caught of his penance
That she priu^ly fill of his accord
To take him for her husbond and for her lord
Of such lordship as men have ouyr her wyuys
And forto led in the more bliss her lyuys
Of his fre will he swoor her as he was a knight
That never in all his life by day ne by night
Ne should of him take no maistrie
Ag^yns her will ne kithe her Jealousy
But her obey and fo^owe her will in all
As any lover to his lady shall
Save the name of souereynte
That would he have for shame of his degree
She thankith him of his humb^enesse
She say^e sire of your gentilnesse
Ye proser me to have so large a reyne
Ne would god never betwix us tweyne
As in my gilt were other werre or strif
Sire I will be your humble true wife
Have here my truth til my heart breast
Thus ben they both in quyete and in rest
For o thing sires sauely dar I say
That frendis eueriche other must obey
In love and forbere each other nedely
If they will live in pees and hold company
When maistrie is come the god of love anon
Betith her wyngis and fare well it is goon
Love is a thing as any thought fre
For women of kind desiren liberte
And not to be constreyned as a thrall
And so does men if I the sothe tell shall
Look who is most pacient in love
He is at his advantage al a boue
Patience is an high virtue certain
For it venquyssheth as clerkis sayn
Thingis that rigor shall never atteyne
For every word men may not chide or p^yne
Lernyth to suffer or ellis so mot I goon
Ye shall it learn wh^thir ye will or noon
For in this world certain no wight is
That he ne does or says sometime amys
I^e siknes or constillacioun
Wine woo or c^aung^nge of complexioun
Causith full often to do amys or spekyn
On every wrong aman may not be wrekyn
Af^ir the time must be temperance
To every wight that can of governance
And therefore has this wise worthy knight
To lyuyn in her suffraunce her behight
And she to him full willy began swear
That never should be defaute in here
Here men may se in humble wise acorde
Thus has she take her servant and her lord
Servant in love and in marriage
Than was he both in lordship and in seruage
Seruage nay but in lordship above
Sith he has both his lady and his love
His lady certis and his wife also
The which law and love accordith thereto
And when he was in his prosperity
Home with his wife he goth to his contre
Not fer ^ro Padmak his dwelling was
Where as he lyuyth in blis and in solas
Who could tell but he that weddid had be
The joy the ese and the prosperity
That is betwix an husbond and his wife
A year or more lestith this blisful life
Til that this knight of which I spak thus
That of kynrede was clepid Arueragus
Shoop him to goon and duelle a year or twain
In Engelond that clepid was Britayne
To seek in armies worship and honor
For all his lust he set in such labor
And duellid there two year the book says thus
Now wol I stynte of this Arueragus
And speak I wol of dorigene his wife
That louyd her husbond as her life
For his absence wepith she and sikith
As done these good wyuys when him likith
She morneth wakith waylith and pleynyth
Desire of his presence so her distreyneth
That all this wide world she set at naught
Her frendis that knew her they thought
Here to comfort in all that ever they may
They prechyn here they techen here night and day
That causeles she sleth her self allas
And every comfort possible in that caas
They do to here and al her besines
To avoid her sorrow and her heaviness
Men mow so long grave in a stoon
Be process as ye known euerichon
Til some figure there ynne pryntid be
So long have they conforted here till she
Received has by hope and by reason
The enpryntinge of her consolacion
Through which her sorrow began to aswage
She may not alwey duryn in such arage
And eke Arueragus in all this care
Has sent her lectris hom of his welfare
And that he wol come hastily again
Or ellis had this sorrow ^er heart slain
And thus they her sorrows for to slake
Prayde her on their knees for goddis sake
To come and Rome her in company
Awey to driven her derk fantesie
And finally she grauntid that request
For well she saw it was for the best
Now stood her castle fast by the se
And often with her frendis walkid she
Here forto disporte upon the bank only
Where she many shippis and bargis sy
Sailing her course where hem list to go
But yet was that a parcel of her woe
For to her self full often allas said she
Is there no ship so many as I se
Would bring hoom my lord than were my heart
Al warisshid of his bittir peynys smert
Anothir time she would sit and think
And cast her yen dounward from the brynke
But when she saw the grisly rockis blake
For verry feer would her heart quake
That on her feet she might not sustene
Than would she sit down up on the grene
And pitously on the sea with sighs old
And says right thus with heart cold
Eterne god that through thy purueaunce
Ledist the world by certain governance
In ydil as ye say ye no think make
But lord this grisly rockis blake
That sownen rather unto foul confusion
Of wreke than to any manner creacion
Of such parfit god wise and stabil
Why have ye wrought this work vnresonab^l
For by this work North south west ne est
There nys y ^ostrid man brid ne best
It does no good to my wit but annoieth
Se ye not lord how mankind it destroieth
An hundrid thousand bodies of mankind
Have rockis slain al though they be not in mind
Syn mankind is so fair a part of thy werk
Thou it maad first lik to thyn owen merk
Than semyth it ye have do a great charity
Toward mankind how might it than be
That ye such menys make it to destroien
Such menes do no good but annoien
I woot well clerkis wol say as hem list
Be argumentis that al is for the best
Though I ne can the causis well know
But that god that made the wynd to blow
As keep my lord this is my conclusion
To clerkis let I al disputacion
But would god that all these rockis blake
Were sonkyn in to hell for his sake
These rockis sle my heart for feer
Thus would she say with many a pitous teer
Here frendis saw that it was no disport
To romyn be the sea but discomforte
And shapen forto pley somwhere ellis
They ledyn here by reueris and by wellis
And in other places dilectablis
They daunsyn and pleyn act ches and (...) tablis
So on a day right on the morrow tide
Unto a gardyn that was there beside
In which that they had made her ordinance
Of vitayl and of other purueaun^e
They goon and pleyn ^em all the long day
And this was in the sixte morrow of May
Which may has peintid with her soft showris
This gardyn full of leuys and of flouris
And craft of mannys hond so coriously
Araid has this gardyn trewly
That never was there gardyn of such pris
But if it were the verry paradise
The odor of flouris and the fressh sight
Wo^de have maad any heart light
That ever was born but if great siknes
Or to greet sorrow held it in distres
So full it was of be^ute with plesaunce
Anon aftir dinner gonne they daun^^
And song also save dorigene alone
Which made alwey her compleynt and her moan
For she ne saw him i^ the dance go
That was her husbond and her love also
But natheles she must her time abide
And with good hope let her sorowis slide
Up on this dance among other men
Daunsid a squier before dorigene
That fressher was and Iolier of assay
As to my dome than is the monthe of May
He singith daunsith passing any other man
That is or was syn the world began
Therewith he was if men should him discryue
On of the best faryng men on live
Young strong virtuous and wise
And well beloved and holdyn in great price
And shortly if I the soth tell shall
Vnwytyng of this Dorigene at all This lusty squier servant to venus
Which that clepid was Aurelius
He louyd her best of any creature
Two year or more as was his adventure
But never durst he tell here his greuaunce
Without the cup drank he al his penance
He was despeyr^d no thing durst he sey
Save in his songis somdele would he wrey
This was in general his compleynynge
He said he louyd and beloved no thing
Of such matter made he many layis
Songis compleyntis rondels virayls
How that he durst not his sorrow tell
But languyng as fire does in hell
And dye he said he must as did Ekko
For Narcrisus that durst not tell his woe
In other manner th^n ye here now say
Ne durst he not his woe to her bewray
Save perauenture at festes and daunsis
There young ^olk kepyn her obseruaunci^
It may weel ben he lokid in her face
In such a wise as m^n that axen grace
But no thing wiste she of his intent
Natheles it happid or they thens went
Be cause that he was her neyghebour
And was a man of worship and honor
And had known him of times yore
They fallen in speech and so more and more
In to his purpos drew Aurilius
And when he saw his time he said thus
Madame quod he by god that this world made
So that I wiste I might your heart glade
I would that day that your Arueragus
Went over the se that I Aurelius
Had gone there I should never come ayeen
For well I woot my seruise is in veyn
My guerdom is but brestyng of mine heart
Madame rewe on my peynys smerte
Here at your feet god would I were begraue
For as wisly as god my soul save
I ne have as now no more leyser to seye
Have mercy sweet or ye wol do me deye
She began to look up on this Aurelius
Is this your will quod she and say ye thus
Never yet quod she wist I what ye meant
Ne never understood I your intent
By that god that yaf me soul and lif
Ne shall I never be untrue wif
In word ne in werk as fer as I have wit
I will be his to whom I am knyt
Take this for fynal answer as of me
But aftir than in pley thus said she
Aurely said she be high god above
Yet wol I grant to be your love
Syn I se you so pitously complain
Look what day fro England to britaigne
Ye remeue all the rockis stoon be stoon
That they ne let ship ne boot to goon
I say when ye have made this cost so clean
Of rockis that there is no stoon I seen
Than wol I love you best of any man
Have here my truth in all that ever I can
For I woot that it shall never betyde
Let such folly out of your heart a slide
What deynte should a man have in his life
Forto go love anothir mannys wife
And her had when so that him likith
Aurilius full sore often he s^kith
Is there none other grace in you quod he
No by that lord that made me
Woe was Aurily when he this herd
And with a sorrowful heart he thus answerde
Madame quod he this were impossibil
Than must I dye in sodeyn death hor^bil
And with that word he turned him anon
Tho com her other friends many on
And in the aleyes romedyn up an down
And no thing wistyn of this conclusion
And suddenly begonnen revel new
Til the bright son lost his hew
For the occident had re^t the son her light
This is as much to say as it was night
And hoom they goon in joy and solas
Save only wre^chid Aurilius allas
He to his house is go^n with sorrowful heart
He says that he ne may from his death astert
He says that he felith his heart cold
Unto heuyn his hondis he began hold
And on his knees hare he set him down
And in rauynge said this orison
Fer v^^ry woo out of his wit he brayde
He nyste what he spak but thus he said
With pitous heart his pleynt has begone
And his prayer made first to the son
He said Appollo god and governor
Of every planet herb tree and flour
That yeuyst aftir thy declinacion
To each of hem his time and his seson
And thyn her^orow chaungith low and hye
Therefore my lord cast ye your ye
On wre^chid Aurily which am but lorn
Lo lord my lady has my death sworn
Withouten any gilt but thy benignite
Up on my dedly heart have some pity
But well I woot Phoebus if ye list
Ye may me help save my lady best
Now vouchauf that I may you deuyse
How that I may be helped and in what wise
Your blisful sustir Lucyna the shene
That of the sea clif goddess is and queen
Though Neptumis have deyte in the sea
Yet Emperesse above him is she
Ye know well lord / right as her desire
Is to be quyckened and lightnyd of your fire
For which she folowith you full bes^ly
Right so the sea desirith naturelly
To follow her and she that is gods
Both in the s^e and ryuers more and les
Wherefore lord Phoebus this is my request
Do this mirakil or do mine heart breast
That thou next at this opposicion
With ynne which sign shall be the lioun
As prays her so greet a flood to bring
That five fadom at the leest it over spring^
The hiest rok that is in all Bretayne
And leet this flood endure yeris tweyne
Than certis to my lady may I sey
Holdith your hest the rokkis be awey
Lord Phoebus this mirakil do for me
Pray here that she go no faster course than ye
I say thus pray your sust^r that she go
No fastir course than y^ in y^^i^ two
Than shall she ^e at euene full always
And spring flood last both night and day
And but ye v^uchesauf in such manner
To grant me my souereyn lady de^e
Pray her to synke every ^^k a down
Into hell her owen derk mansioun
Under the ground there Pluto duellith in
Or never shall I my lady wyn
Thy tempil in delphose wol I seek
Lord Phoebus se the teris on my cheke
And of my pain have some compassion
And with that word in swonnynge he fill adoun
And long time he lay in a trance
His brothir which knew his penance
Up caught him and to bed has him brought
Dispeiryd in this turment and in this thought
Let I this woeful creature ly
Chese he whethir he wol live or die
Arueragus with hele and honor
As he that was of cheualrye the flour
Is common hoom and other worthy men
A blisful heart has now dorigen
That have thy blisful husbond in thyn armies
The fresh kn^ght the worthy man of armies
That louith the as his owen hertis life
No thing list he to be ymaginatyf
If any wight had spoke whylis he was out
To her of love there of had he no doubt
He not entendith to such matere
But daunsith iustith and makith good cheer
And thus in joy and blis I let hem duelle
And of the sik Aurilius wol I tell
In langour and in turment furious
Two year and more lay this Aurilius
Or any foot he might on earth goon
Comfort in this time had he noon
Save his brothir which was a clerk
He knew all this woo and all this werk
For to noon other creature certain
Of this matter he durst no word sayn
Under his breast he bare it more secree
Than ever did Phamphilus or Galathe
His breast was hool without forto seen
But in his heart ay was the arow keen
And weel I know of Surgeture
In surgerye full perleus is the cure
But men might touch the arow or com thereby
His brother wepith and waylith privily
Till at last him fyl in remembrance
That whylis he was at Orliaunce in France
As young clerkis that been likorous
To redyn artis that been curious
Sekyn in every halke and every herne
Particular science forto learn
He him remembrid that up on a day
In orliaunce in a book that he say
Of magik naturel with his fellow
That was that time a bachel^r of law
Al were he there to learn another craft
Had privily up on his deslie laft
Such a book as spak much of operacions
And of many diverse coniuracions
That longen to the moon and such folly
As in our days is not worth a fly
For holy church says in our believe
Ne suffrith not illusion us to grieve
And when this book was in remembrance
Anon for joy his heart began to dance
And to him self he said privily
My brothir warisshed shall be hastily
For I am siker there be sciences
Be which men make diverse apparencis
Which all these subtle tregetouris pley
For often at festis have I herd seye
That tregetouris withynne an halle large
Have made come in watir in a barge
And in the halle rowen up an down
Some time has seemed come a greet lioun
And some time flouris spryngyng in a mede
Some time wine and grapis white and read
Some time a Castle of lyme and stone
And when he likith it voidith anon
Thus semyth it to many a mannys sight
Now than conclude I thus if I might
At orliaunce some old fellow find
That had the monys mansions in mind
Or other magik naturel above
He should well make my brother have his love
For which appearance a clerk may make
To mannys sight that all the rockis blake
Of Brita^ne were voydid euerichoon
And shippis be the br^nkis common and goon
And in such^ form endure a woke or two
Than were my brothir warisshid of his woe
Than must she nedis hold her beheste
Or ellis he shall shame her at the least
What should I make a longer tale of this
Unto his brotheris bed I come he is
And such comfort he yaf him forto goon
To Orliaunce that he up stert anoon
And on his wey than onward is he fare
In hope forto be lissid of his care
When they were come almost to that ci^e
But if it were a two forlong or three
A young clerk romynge him self they meite
Which that in latin thriftely hem grette
And aftir he said a wonder thing
I know quod he the cause of your coming
And er they further any foot went
He told hem al what was here intent
This britoun clerk him axid of felawys
The which he had known in old days
And he answerid hem that they ded were
For which he wept full meny a tere
Down of his horse Aurilius light anon
And with this magicien forth he began goon
Hoom to his house and made him well at ese
Him lackid no vitayl that hem might plese
So well araid house as there was oon
Aurilius in his life saw never noon
He shewde him or he went to Sopere
Forestis Parkis full of wild dear
There saw he hertis with her hornys hye
The grectist that were ever seye with ye
He saw of hem an hundrid sleyn with houndis
And some of arowes blede and bitter woundis
He saw where woundid were these wild deer
The faucons up on a fair river
That with her beckis began herons sleyn
To sy he knyghtis iustynge in a pleyn
And aftir this he did him such plesaunce
That ^e him shewde his lady in a dance
In which him self daunsed as him thought
And when this master the this magik wroughte
Saw it was time he clappid his hondis to
And farewell our revel was al y do
He rem^ued never out of his house
While they saw all this meruayllous
But in his stody there as his bokis be
They sittyn stille while they saw this they three
To him this maistir callid his squier
And said him thus is ready our soper
Almost an hour it is I undertake
Syn I you bad our soper for to make
When that these worthy men went with m^
In to my stody there as my bokis be
Sire quod the squier when it likith you
It is al ready though ye will right now
Go we soap quod he ^t is for the best
These armorous folk sumtyme most have rest
And aftir soper fyl they in trete
What sum^e should the maistris guerdom be
To remeue all the rockis in Britaigne
And eek from geronde to the mouth of said
He made him strange he swoor so god him save
Less than a thousand pound he would not have
Ne gladly for that sum^e he nolde not goon
Aurilius with blisful heart anon
Says thus fie on a thousand pound
The wide world which men say is round
I would it give if I were lord of it
This bargayn is full drive and full knyt
Ye shul be paid trewly be my truth
But lokith now for noon negligence ne slouthe
Ye tarry us here no longer than to morrow
Nay quod the clerk have here my feith to borow
To bed he goth Aurilius when him lest
And well nygh all that night he had rest
What for his bargayn and for his hope of bliss
His woeful heart of penance had a lisse
Up on the morrow when it was day
To Britayne took they the right way
Aurilius and this Magicien him beside
And he descended there they wol abide
And this was as the book does remember
The cold frosty seson of decembre
Phoebus hew w^xid was lik latoun
That a fore in his hoot declinacioun
Shone as the buruyd gold with stremy^ bright
But then in Capricorn adoun he light
Ther^ as he shone full p^al I dar well sayn
The bittir frostis with the slit of rayn
Destroid h^th the grene in every yerd
Iamis s^t by the fire with dowbyl berde
And drynketh of his bugil horn the wine
And aftir this ale both good and fyn
And nowel cries every lusty man
Aurilius does all that he can
To wait a time of his conclusion
This is to say to make illusion
Be such apparent Iogelrye
I can no termys of astrology
They shewde that every wight should we^^ and say
That of Britayne the rockis were away
Or ellis they were sonkyn under the ground
So at the last he has his time y found
To make his Ia^e and his wre^chidnes
Of such a supersticion of cursidnes
His tab^is tolentanes forth he brought
Full weel correctid it lackid naught
Neythir his colet ne his expan^s yeris
Ne his rotis ne his oth^^ geris
And by his centris and his argumentis
And his proporcinel contentis
For his equacions in every thing
And by his eygth sp^ere in his workyng
He knew full we^l how fer anath was sow
Fro the head of that fix ari^s bow
That in the.iij. spe^e considerid is
Full subtly he calked all this
When he had his first mansion^
He knew the remenaunt by proporcion^
And knew the risinge of the moon well
And in whose face and sign eueridell
And knew well the monys mansion^
Attendant unto his operac^on^
And he knew also well his other obseruauncis
For such illusions and such myschauncis
As hethen folk vseden in tho days
For sothe no longer makith he delays
But through his magik a woke or tweye
It semyd that all the rockis were a weye
Aurilius yet which that despeyrid is
Where he shall have her love or fare amys
And waytith night and day on this mirakil
And when he knew there was non obstakil
That v^idid were the rockis echon
Down to his maistris feet he fyl anon
And said I woeful wre^ched Aurilius
Thank you lord and my lady venus
That me have help fro m^ caris cold
And to the tempil his wey has he hold
Where as he knew he should his lady se
And when he saw his time anon right he
With dredful heart and humbil chere
Salewid has his souereyn lady dear
My right lady quod this woeful man
Whom y most dread and love as I ^^st ca^
And lothest were in all this world displese
Nere it for you I have such disese
That I moot dye here at your foot anon
Naught would I tell you me is woe begoon
But certis or I must dye or pleyne
Ye sle me giltles for verry pain
But of my death ye have no routhe
Thinkith now up on your truth
And repent you for that god above
Or ye me sle by ^^use that I you love
For Madame well ye woot what ye have hight
Not that I chalange any thing of right
Of you my souereyn lady but of your grace
But in the gardyn yonder in such a place
Ye witen right weel what ye behetyn me
And in mine hond there your truth plight ye
To love me best / god woot ye said so
Al be it that unworthy I be thereto
Madame I speak for the honor of you
More than forto save my hertis lif right now
I have ydo as ye commanded me
And if ye vou^hesauf ye mow se
Since as you ^^st have your hest in mind
For quyck or ded true shul ye me find
In you lith to do me live or deye
But well I woot the rock^s been aweye
He takith his l^ue and she a stoned stood
In all her face nas o drope of blood
She wen^e never to come in such a trappe
Allas quod she that ever this should hap
For wend I never be possibilite
That such a meruayl might be
That is ayens the process of nature
And hoom she goth a sorouful creature
For ferry feer uneath might she go
She wepith and waylith a day or two
And swownyth that ^owthe was to se
But why it was unto noman told she
For out of town was goon A^ueragus
But to her self she spak and said thus
With face paal and sorouful chere
In her compleynt as ye shul aftir here
Allas quod she on the fortune I pleyne
That vnwaar wrappid have me in thy cheyne
Fro which to escape know I no so^our
Save only death or to great dishonor
One of these two behouyth me to chese
But natheles yet have I leuyr lose
My life than of my body have a shame
Or know my self falls or lose my name
And with my death I may be quyt Iwis
Has there not many an nobil wife or this
And meny a maid s^eyn her self allas
Rathir than with her body done trespaas
Yes certes these story^^ berith witness
When.xxx. tiraun (...) full of cursidnes
Had sleyn cruelly Fidon at feste
They comaundid his doughtris forto a^este
And bring hem f^rth in despit
Al nakid to fulfille her delit
And on her fadres blood made hem daun^e
Up on the pament god give hem myschaunce
For which the woeful maidens full of dread
Rathir than they would lose her maydenhede
They been privily stert in to a well
And dreynt hem self as the bokis tell
They of m^ten leten enquire and seek
Of lacedomy fifty maidens eke
On which they wolden a done her lecherye
But was there non of all that company
That she nas sleyn and that with glad intent
C^^es rather to dye than to assent
To be oppressid of her maydenhede
Why should I thanne to dye be in dread
Lo eke the tiraunt Aristoclides
That louyd a maid highte Stymphalides
When her fader sleyn was on a night
Unto dianes goth she right
And hente the image in her hondis two
From which image would she not go
No wight the hondis of here might arace
Til she was sleyn right in the place
Now since that maidens had such despit
To been ^ispoylid with mannys delit
Well ought a wife rath^r her self to sle
Than be defoylid as thinkith me
What shall I say of Hasdr^^^aldis wife
That at Cartage bereft her self her life
When that she saw the romans win the town
She took her childryn all and skipped a down
In to the fire and chaas rather to dye
Than any romayn did her vilony^
Has not Lucrece slain her self allas
At rome for she oppressid was
Of Tarquyne for her thought it was a shame
To live when she had lost her name
The.vij. maidens of Millesses also
Have sleyn hem self for verey dread and woo
Nather than the folk of Galele should hem oppress
Mo than a thousand stories y guess
Could I tell as touching this matere
When Hellerada was sleyn his wife so dear
Her self slough and leet her blood to glide
In hellaradas o^en woundis wide
And said my body act lest wey
There shall no wight defoylle it if I may
What shall I of hem mo ensamplis sayn
But so many have hem self slain
Well rathir than they would defoulid be
I wol conclude that is the best for me
To sle my self than be defoulid thus
I wol be true unto Arueragus
Or ellis sle my self in some manner
Right as did demecions daughter dear
Be cause she ne would defouled be
Of Ocedasus it is full greet pite
To read how thy doughtris deyde allas
That slough her self in such a manner was
As great pite it was or well more
The Theban maiden that for Nichamore
Her self slough right for such manner woo
And another Theban maiden right so
For one of Macedone had her ouyr pressid
She with her death her maydenhede redressid
What shall I sayn of Maceratis wife
That for such a caas beraft her self her life
How true eek was also Alcebades
That for his love to dien rathir chees
Than forto suffer his body unburied to be
Which a wife was Alceste also quod she
What says Omere of Penelope
Al greece knows of her chastity
Parde of lacedomea is writyn thus
That when at rome was sleyn Protholomus
No longer would she live aftir his day
The same of nobil Prothenna tell y may
Without Brutus could she never live
To whom she had her heart al give
The parfyt wife of Archemecye
Honourid is through out al Barbarye
O tentquies thy verey chastity
To all wyuys may a mirror be
Thus pleyneth Dorigene a day or twey
Purposinge ever that she would dey
But natheles up on the thridde night
Home comyth Ar^eragus the worthy knight
And axeth here why she w^pith so s^re
And she began weep ever lengir the more
And told him all the caas by and by
How she had promised ignorantly
The squier like as ye have herd to fore
Hit needs not to reherce hit any more
This husbond with glad chere in friendly wise
Answerde and said as I shall deuyse
Is there aught ellis Dorigene but this
Nay nay she said god help me so as wis
This is to mykil and it ne were goddis will
Ye wife quod he lat slepyn and be still
It may be well yet perauenture to day
Ye shall your truth hold be my fay
For god so wisly have mercy on me
I had well lever stikid forto be
For verry love which I to you have
But ye should your truth keep and save
Truth is the hiest thing that man may keep
But with that word she brast anon to weep
And said I you forbede on pain of death
That never while you lastith life or breath
To no wight to tell of this mysauenture
As I may lest I wol my woo endure
Ne make no contenaunce of heaviness
That folk of you may deem harm or g^s
And forth he clepith a squier and a maid
Go forth anon with Dorig^ne he s^yde
And bring her to such a place anon
They took her leave and on her wey they goon
But they ne wiste why she thither went
He would no wight tell his entente
This squier which hight Auril^us
On Dorigene that was amerous
Of adventure happid here to mete
Amyd the town right in the quickest street
As she would have gone the wey forth right
Toward the gardyn there as she had hight
And he was in to the gardyn ward also
For well he spyed when she would go
Out of her house to any manner place
But thus they metyn be adventure and grace
And he salueth her with glad intent
And a^id of her whithirward she went
And she answerde half as she were mad
Unto the gardyn as my husbond bad
My truth forto hold allas allas
Aurilius began wonder in this caas
And in his heart had great compassion
Of her chere and of her lamentacion
And of Arueragus the worthy knight
That bad her hold that she had hight
So loath him was if she shol^e break her truth
And in his heart he caughte of this great rowthe
Considering the best on every side
That from that lust yet were him lever abide
Than to do so high a folissh wre^chidnes
Ageyns fraunchecie and gentilnes
For which in few wordis said he thus
Madame say to your lord Arueragus
That since y se his great gentilnes
To you and eke I se your distres
That him were lever have a shame and tht were routhe
Than ye to me this should break your truth
I have well leuyr euyr to suffer woo
Than I depart should the love beetwix you two
I you relece Madame in to your hond
Quyt every ^urement and every bond
That ye have made to me as here beforn
Sithen that time that ye were first born
My truth y plight I shall you never repreue
Of noon beheste and here I take my leave
As of the trewest and eke the best wife
That ever yet I knew in all my life
But every wife bewaar of her beheste
On Dorigene remembrith act lest
Thus can a squier do a gentil deed
As well as can a knight withouten dread
She thankith him up on her knees bare
And hoom to her husbonde is she fare
And told him al as ye have herd me said
And be ye sikir that he was well a paid
That it were impossible me to write
What should I leng^r of this caas endite
Arueragus and Dorigene his wife
In souereyn bliss ledyn forth her life
Never aftir was there anger hem between
He cherisshed her though she were a queen
And she was true to him for evermore
Of these two folk ye get of me no more
Aurilius that his cost has al forlorn
Cursith the time that he was born
Allas allas quod he that y behight
Of purid gold a thousand pound weight
Unto this Philosopher how shall I do
I se no more but that I am fordo
Mine heritage y must nedis selle
And be a beggar here I may not duelle
And shamyn al my kynrede in this place
But I of him may get sum grace
But natheles I wol of him assay
At certain yeris and days to pay
And thank him of his great courtesy
My truth wol I keep I will not lie
With heart sore he goth unto his cofyr
And brought gold unto this Philosophir
The value of five hundrid pound I ges
And him besechith of his gentilnes
To grant him day^s of the remenaunt
And said maistir I dar well make auaunt
I faylid never of my truth as yet
For sikirly my debt shall be quyt
Toward you how ever that I face
To go a beggyng in my kirtil bare
But if ye would v^uchesauf on surete
Two year or three to respite me
Than were I well for ellis mot I selle
Mine heritage there is no more to tell
This Philisophre sobirly answerde
And said thus when he his wordis herd
Have y not hold covenant unto the
Yes certis well and trewly quod he
Have thou not had thy lady as the likith
No no quod he and soroufully he sikith
What was the cause tell me if thou can
Aurilius anon his tale began
And told him al as ye have herd before
It nedith not to reherce it you no more
He said Arueragus of gentilnes
Had lever to dye in sorrow and in distres
Than that his wife were of her troth falls
The sorrow of Dorigene he told him als
How loath her were to be a wickid wife
And that she had lever have lost her life
And her truth she swoor thorou Innocence
She never erst had herd of appearance
That made me to have in her so great pity
And right as freely as he sent her to me
As freely sent I her hom to him again
This is al and some th^r is no more to seyn
This Philisophir answerde leave brother
Euerich of you did gentilnes to other
Thou art a squier and he is a knight
But god forbede for his blisful might
But a clerk could do as gentil a deed
As well as any of you it is no dread
Sire I relece thy thousand pound
As now thou were cropen out of the ground
Ne never or now thou haddist kno^ (...)
For sire I wol not take a penny of the
For all my craft ne for all my trauaylle
Thou have well paid for my vi^aylle
It is ynow farwell and have good day
And took his horse and forth he goth his way
Lordingis this question than a^e I you
Which was the most s^e as thinkith you
Now tellith me er ye furthir wend
I can no more my tale is at an end
Here endith the Frankeleyns tale. Here beg^nneth the second Nonnes prolog.
THe mynystre and norisshe of all vicis
Which that men clepe in english Idelnesse
Which that is porter of the yate of delicis
To es^huen and by her contrary hem to oppress
That is to say be leefful besines
Well ought we to do al our intent
Lest that the fend with Idelnes us hent
For he with his thousand cordis slye
Continually us waytith to be clappe
When he may man in Idelnes aspye
He can so lightly ca^che him in his trappe
Til that a man behent right by the lap
He nys not waa^ the fend has him in hond
Well ought us worche and ydelnes withstond
And though men dread never forto dye
Yet se men well be reason doutles
That ydelnesse is hotyn slogardrye
Of which there comyth never no good encrees
And syn that slougthe her holdith in a lees
Only forto sleep and ete and drink
And to deuouryn all that other swynke
And forto put us from such ydelnes
That cause is of so great confusion^
I have here done my feithful besines
Aftir the legend and translacion^
Right so thy glorious life and passion^
Thou with thy garlond wrought of rose of lilye
The mean I maid and martyr saint Cecily
And thou that flour art of virginis all
Of whom that Bernard list so well to write
To the at my first beginning I call
Thou comfort of us wre^chis do me endite
Thy maidens death that when thoro^ her merit
The eterne life thou grant of the fend victory
As men mow aftir read in her story
Thou maid and mother daughter of thy sone
Thou well of mercy synful soulis to cure
In whom that god of bounte chaas forto wone
Thou humbil and high over every creature
Thou noblist so ferforth over nat^re
That no disdeigne thy maker had of kind
His sone in blood a^^ flessh to cloth^ and wynd^
Which in the cloister of thy blisful entrees
Took mannys shapthe the eterne love and p^es
That of thy tryne compass lord and g^de is
Whom heuyn and earth and se without les

And though that I unworthy sone of Eve

And for that ^eith is ded without werkis
So forto werkyn ^eue me wit and space

O thou that art so fair and full of grace
Be mine advocate in that high place
There as withouten end is sunge Osanne
Thou cristis mother daughter dear of anne
And of thy light my soul in prison l^ght
That troublid is be the cogitacion
Of my body and also be the wight
Of ertly lust and falls affection
O hauyn of refut o salvation
Of hem that been in sorrow and distress
Now help forto my work I wol me dress
Yet y pray you that redyn that I write
For yef me that I do no diligence
This ilke story besily to endite
For both have I the wordis and the ^^^tence
Of him that at seyntis reverence
The story wroot and followed her (...)
As ferforth as god will me grace se^^
First would I you the name of saint (...)
Expoune as men may in her story se
It is to say in englissh heuenys ly^ye
For pure chastnes of virginite
Or for she witness had of honest
And grene of conscience and of god ^^me
The sweet savor lily was her name
Or Cecily is to say the wey to blind
For she ensaumpil was be good techinge
Or ellis Cecily as I writyn find
Is joined be a manner conning
Of heuyn and lya in her infigurynge
The heuyn is set for thought of holiness
And lya for her lasting besines
Cecily may eek be said in this manner
Wantyng of blyndnes for her great light
Of sapience and for her thewis clear
Or ellis lo this maidens name bright
Of heuyn and leos comyth of which be right
Men might her well the heuyn of p^pil call
Ensample of good and wise workis with all
For leos pepil in englissh is forto say
And right as men may in the heuyn se
The son and moan and sterris every way
Right so men gostly in this maiden fre
Sawyn of feith the great magnanimite
And eek the clerenes hool of sapience
And sundry werkis bright of excellence
And right so as these philosophris write
That heuyn is swift and round and eke brennynge
Right so was fair Cecily the white
Full swift and besy in every good werkyng
And round and hool in good persevering
And brennynge ever in charity full bright
Now have I declared you what she hight
THere endith the Second Nonnys prolog. And here begins the tale.
This maiden bright Cecili as her legende says
Was common of romans of nobil kind
And from her ^^adil up fostrid in the faith
Of crist and baar his gospel in mind
She never seced as I written find
Of her praiere and god to love and dread
Besekynge him to keep her maydenhede
And when this maid should unto a man
I weddid be that was full of young age
Which that y clepid was valerian
And day was come of her marriage
She full devout and humbil in her courage
Under her robe of gold that sat full feyre
Had next her flessh I clad her in an heir
And while that the Organs made melody
To god above thus in her heart song she
O lord my body and eek my soul gy
Vnwemmyd lest I confoundid be
And for his love that up on the tree
Every second and thridde day she fast
Ay biddynge in her orisons full fast
The night came and to bed must she goon
With her husbonde as it was the manner
And privily she said to him anoon
O sweet and welbelouyd spouse dear
There is a counsel and ye wol it here
Which that right fayn I would to you seye
So that ye swear ye will it not bewrey
Valerian began fast to her swear
That for no caas ne thing that might be
He should never to none bewreyen her
And than at erst to him said she
I have an aungel which that louyth me
That with great love where so I wake or sleep
Is ready ay my body forto keep
And if that he may felen out of dread
That ye me touch or love in vilony
He right anon will sle you with the deed
And in your youth thus shul ye die
And if that ye in clean lif me gy
He wol you love as me for your clennes
And show to you his joy and his brightness
This Valerian correctid as god would
Answerde again if I shall triste the
Let me that aungel se and him behold
And if that it a ver^y aungel be
Than wol I do as thou have praid me
And if thou love anothir man for soth
Right with this swerd than wol I sle you both
Cecily answerde anon right in this wise
Y^f that you list anon right the aungel shul ye se
So that ye trow on crist and you baptize
Goth forth to via app^a quod she
That from this town stondith but mylis three
And to the pour folkis that there duellyn
Sey hem right thus as I shall you tellyn
Tell hem that I Cecili you to hem sent
To shown you good urban the old
For secretnes and for good intent
And when that ye saint urban have behold
Tell him the wordis which that I to you told
And when that he has purgid you from sin
Than shall ye se that aungel or ye twynne
This Valerian is in to the place goon
And right as he was taught be her learning
He fond this holy man urban anon
Among the saintis beriels lokynge
And he anon withouten taryynge
Did his message and when that (...) told
Urban for joy began his hondis uphold
The teris from his yen let he fall
Almighty lord O Ihesu crist quod he
Sower of chastity counselor of v^^^lle
The fruit of that seed of chastity
That thou have sow in Cecily take to the
Lo lik a bisy be withoutyn gyle
Thy servant ay thyn owen thral Cecile
For that spouse that she took but new
Full lik a fers lioun she sendith here
As meke as ever was any lamb to ewe
And with that word anon there began apere
An old man yclothid in whithe clothis clear
That had a book with lettir of gold in hand
And began before valerian forto stand
Valerian as ded fyl down for dread
When he this old man saw standing so
Which forthwith anon he herd him read
O lord of all o feith o god withouten mo
O cristendome and fadir of al also
Abouyn al and ouyr al euerywhere
These wordis al with gold written were
When this was red then said this old man
Leuyst thou this thing or no say ye or nay
I leave al thing quod valerian
For sother thing than this I dar well say
Under heuyn no wight think may
Tho ^^nysshed this old man he ne wiste where
And Pope Urban him cristened right dear
Valerian goth hoom and fyndeth Cecily
With ynne his chambir with an angel stond
This aungel had of rosis and of lily
Crownys two the which he bare in hond
And first to Cecily as I understand
He yaf that on and than began he take
That other to valerian her make
With body cleen and vnwemmyd thought
Kepith ay weel this crownys quod he
Fro Paradyse to you hem have I brought
Ne never mo shall they roten be
Ne lose her sote sauyr trustith me
Ne never wight ne shall se hem with ye
But he be chaste and hate velony
And thou valerian for thou so sone
Assentist to goddis counsel also
Say what thou list and thou shall have thy bone
I have a brothir quod valerian tho
That in this world I love noman so
I pray you that my brother may have grace
To know the truth as I do in this place
The aungel said god likith thy request
And hothe with the palm of matirdome
Ye shul come in to his blisful rest
And with that word Tiburce his brother com
And when that he the savor vndernom
Which that rosis and the lilyes cast
He spak unto his brother in great haste
And said I wonder this time of the year
Whens that this sweet savor comyth so
Of rosis and of lilyes that y smelle here
For though y had hem in my hondis two
The savor might in me no depper go
The sweet savor that in my heart I find
Has chaungid me al in another kind
Valerian said two crounys have we
Snow whit and rose reed that shyneth clear
Which that thyn yen have no might to see
And as thou smellist thourogh my prayer
So shall thou se hem leave brother dear
If it so be thou will withouten slowthe
Believe a right and know verry trowthe
Tiburce answerde say thou this to me
In sothnes or in dreme I herkyn this
In dremys quod valerian have we be
Unto this time brother mine ywis
But now at erst our duelling in truth is
How wotist thou this quoth Tiburce and in what wise
Quod Valerian that shall I the deuyse
The aungel of god has me the truth I taught
Which thou shall se if thou will reneye
The ydollis and be clean and ellis naught
And of the mirakyl of these crounys tweye
Saint Ambrose in his prefas list forto seye
Solempuli this nobil doctor dear
Comendith and says in this manner
The palm of martirdom forto receive
Saint Cecile fulfilled of goddis yefte
The world and eek her chambir began she weyue
Witness Cecily and Tiburces shrifte
To which god of his bounte would shifte
Crownys two of flouris sweet smelling
And his aungel hem the crownys bring
The maid has brought hem to blis above
The world has wist that it is worthy certain
Devotion and chastity well forto love
Tho shewde him Cecily al open and pleyn
That all ydols been but a thing in veyn
For they be dombe and thereto they be deef
And charged him his ydolis forto leef
Who so that trow^th not this a best he is
Quod tho Tiburce if I shall not lie
And she began kiss his breast that herd this
And was full glad be couthe truth aspye
This day I take the for mine alye
Said this blissed fair maiden dear
And aftir that she said as ye mow here
Lo right so as the love of crist quod she
Made me thy brotheris wife right in this wise
Anon for mine alye bear take I the
Syn that thou will thy^ ydols despise
Go with thy b^other now and the baptize
And make the cleen so that thou may behold
That angelis face which thy brothir of told
Tiburce answerde and said brother dear
First tell me whethir I shall and to what man
To whom quoth he com forth with right good chere
I will the led unto the pope urban
To Urban brother mine quod va^erian
Quod tho Tiburce wolt thou me thider led
Me thinks that it were a wonder dread
Ne mean ye not urban quod he tho
That is so often dampened to be ded
And woneth in halkis alwey to and fro
And dar not onys put forth his head
Men should him brenne in a fire so reed
If he were found if men might him aspye
And we also to bear him company
And while we sekyn that divinity
That is hid in heuene privily
Algate b^ent in this world shall we be
To whom Cecily answerde boldly
Men might dread well and skilfully
This lif to like mine owen dear brother
If this were living only and non other
But there is bettir lif in other place
That never shall belost ne dread the naught
Which goddis sone us told through his grace
That fadris sone has al thing wrought
And all that wrought is with a skilful thought
The ghost that from the fader began proceed
Has soulid him withouten any d^ed^
By word and by mirakil lo goddis son^
When he was in this world declarid here
That there is other life there men may won
To whom answerde Tiburce o fustir dear
Ne s^ydist thou right now in this manner
There nas but o god lord in sothfastnes
And now of three how may thou bear witness
That shall I tell quod she or that I go
Right as a man has sapiences three
Memory engeny and intellect also
So in such being of dyuinyte
Three persons may there right well be
Tho began she there full bisily him preche
Of cristis son and of his peynes teache
And many poyntis of his passion
How goddis sone in this world was witholde
To do mankind pleyn remission
That been bound in synnys and caris cold
All these thingis she unto Tiburce told
And aftir this Tiburce in good intent
With Valerian to Pope Urban went
That thankid god and with glad heart and light
He cristned him and made him in that place
Parfit in his lernyng goddis knight
And aftir this Tiburce gat such grace
That every day he saw in time and space
The aungel of god and every manner bone
That he god a^id it was sped full sone
It were full hard be order forto seyn
How many wondris Ihesus for him wrought
But at last to tell short and pleyn
The sergeauntis of the town hem sought
And hem before almache the Prefect brought
Which hem appo^id and knew al her intent
And to the image of Iubiter hem sent
And said who so will do no sacrifise
Swap of his head this is my sentence here
Anon these martirs that I you deuyse
One Maximus that was an officere
Of the Prefectis and his Councelere
Hem hent and the sayntis forthledde
Him self he wept for pity that he had
When Maximus had herd the sayntis lore
He gat him of the turmentours leave
And had hem to his house withouten more
And with her prechinge or it were eve
They gonne fro the turmentours forto reave
And fro Maxim and fro his folk echone
The false feith to trow in god allone
Cecily came when it was woxe night
With preestis that hem cristned all in fere
And afterward when day was woren light
Cecily said hem with a full steadfast chere
Now cristis owen knyghtis leef and dear
Cast al awey the workis of derknesse
And arm you with armies of brightness
Ye have forsooth ydon a great bataylle
Your course is done your feith has you conserved
Goth to the croune of lif that may not faylle
The rightful Judge which ye have served
Shall give it you as ye have it deseruyd
And when this thing was said as y deuyse
Men led hem forth to do sacrifyse
But when they were to the place I brought
To tellen shortly the conclusion
They nolde encence ne sacrifyse right naught
But on here knees setten hem a down
With humbil heart and sad deuocioun
And losten both her heddis in the p^ace
Her soulis went to the king of grace
This Maximus that saw this thing betyde
With pitous teris told it anon right
That he her soulis saw to heuyn glide
With aungelis full of cleernes and light
And with his word conuertid many a wight
For which almachins did him so to beat
With whippis of led til he is lif began let
Cecily him ^ook and buried him anon
By tiburce and val^rian sothly
With ynne her bur^ynge place under the stoon
And aftir this Almachins hastily
Bad his mymstris fecchyn openly
Cecily so that she might in his presence
Do sacrifyse and Iubiter encence
But they conuertid at her wise lore
Weptyn full sore and yaf full credence
Unto her word and criden more and more
Crist goddis sone which without difference
To v^rry god this is our sentence
That has a servant so good him to serve
This with o voys we trowen though we sterue
Almachins that herd of this doing
Bad fecche Cecily that he might her se
And alder first this was his axinge
What manner woman art thou quod he
I am a gentilwoman born quod she
I axe the quod he though it the grieve
Of thy religion and of thy believe
Why than began ye your question folily
Quod she that would two answers conclude
In o demand ye axid lewdly
Almache answerde to that ^imilitude
Of whens comyth thyn answer so rude
Of whens quod she when that she was freyned
Of conscience and of good feith unfeigned
Almachins said ne takist thou no head
Of my power and she answered him this
Your might quod she is full litil to dread
For every mortal mannys power nys
But lik a bladder full of wynd ywis
For with anedelis point when it is blow
May all the boste of it be leid full low
Full wrongfully began thou quod he
And in wrong is yet al thy perseueraunce
Wost thou not how our Princis mighty and fre
Have thus comaundid and made ordenaunce
That every cristyn wight shall have penance
It is a shame that the pepyl shall
So skorne and lawghe at thy folly
For comynly men woot it well over all That mighty god is in his heuenys hye
And these ymagis well thou may aspye
To the ne to hem self may do no profit
For in effect they be not worth amyte
This and such other said she
And he wax wroth and bad men should her led
Hoom until her house and in her house quoth he
Bren her in a bath of flamys read
And as he bad right so was it do in deed
For in a bath they gonne her fast shittyn
And night and day fire they under bettyn
The long night and eke the day also
For all the fire and eek the great hete
She sat al cold and fel^d no woo
It made her not a drope forto sweet
But in that bath her lif she moot let
For almachyns with a full wickid intent
To s^e her in the Bath his sonde to her sent
Three strokis in the neck he smoot here tho
The turmentour but for no manner chance
He might not smite her neck atwo
And for there was that time an ordenaunce
That noman should do to no person such penance
The fourth struck to smyten soft or soxe
This turmentour du^ste do no more
But half ded with her neck coruyn there
He left her ly and on his wey is went
The christian folk which that about her were
With shetis have the blood up hent
Three days leuyd she in this turment
And never cesid hem the feith to teache
That she had fostrid hem she began to preche
And there she yaf her meuablis and her thing
And to Pope Urban betook hem tho
And said I askid this of heuene king
To have respit three days and no mo
To perform that I before have do
These soulis and that I may do wirche
Here of my house perpetuelly a church
Saint Urban with his dekenys privily
The body fet and biried it be night
Among his other sayntis honestly
Her house the church of saint Cecily hight
Saint Urban hallowed it as he well might
In which in to this day in nobil wise
Men do to crist and to his seyntis seruise
Here endith the Second Nonnes tale. And Begins the prolog of the chauons
yeman.
WHen told was the life of saint Cecile
Or we had riden fully.v. mile
At boughten under ^le us began a take
Aman that clothid was in clothis blake
And underneath he waar a white surp^ice
His hakney which was of pomel gryce
So swatte he that wonder was to se
Hit semyd that he had prykid my^^s three
About the peytrel stood the foam full hye
He was of foam as fleckid as a pie
The hakeney eek that his yeman rood upon
So swatte that vnnethis might it goon
A male twifolde up on his cropyn lay
It semyd that he carried litil array
Al light for somer rood this worthy man
And in mine heart I wonder began
What that he was til that I understood
How that his cloak was sowid to his hood
For which when I had long auysid me
I demyd him ^um chanon forto be
His ^at hing at his bak down by alace
For he had riden more than trot or pace
He rood ay prykynge as he were wood
A clote leef he had l^yd under his hood
For swoot and forto keep his head ^ro hete
But it was joy for to se him sweet
His forhed droppid as a stillatory
Were full of planteyn or of peritory
And when he was come he began cry
God save quod he this ioly company
To riden in this merry company
His yeman was eek full of courtesy
Fast have I pr^kid quoth he for your sake
Be cause that I w^ld you over take
And said siris now in the ^orow tide
Out of your hosterye I ^ow y^^ ride
And warned here my lord and souereyn
Which that to riden with you is full feyn
For his disport he louith daliaunce
Friend for thy warning god give the good chance
Than said our ost certain it would seem
Thy lord were wise and so y may well deem
He is full iocunde also dar y ley
Can he ought tell a merry tale or twey
With which he glad may this ^ompany
Who sir my lord ye sir withouten ly
He can of mirthe and eke of iolite
Not but ynow also sire trustith me
And ye him knew as well as do I
Ye would wondre how well and craftily
He could work and that in sundry wise
He has taken on him meny a great empryse
Which were full hard for any that is here
To bring about but they of him lere
As homely as he ridith amongis you
If ye him knew it would be for your prow
Ye would not forgon his aqueyntaunce
For michil good I dar ley in balaunce
All that I have in my possession^
He is a man of hye discrecion^
I warn you he is a passing wise man
Well quod our host tell me if thou can
Is he a clerk or none tell me what he is
A clerk nay nay he is gretter than a clerk ywis
Said this yeman and in wordis few
Oste and of his craft some what wol I show
Sire my lord can such a subtilte
That al his craft ye may not wite of me
For all the ground to Caunterbury town
He could all clean turn up so down
And paue it al with silver and with gold
And when this yeman has thus told
Unto our ost he said benedicite
This thing is wonder meruaylus to me
Syn that thy lord is of so high prudence
Be cause of which should men him reverence
That of his worship reckith he so lyte
His ouerist sloppe is not worth a myte
As in effect to him so moot I go
It is al baudy and to tore also
Why is thy lord so sluttyssh I the pray
And of power is bettir cloth to bey
If that his deed a cord with his speech
Tell me and that I the beseech
Why quod this yeman whereto axe ye of me
God help me so for he shall never the
But I wol not auowe that I sey
And ther^ore keep it se^ret I you prey
He is to wise in feith as I believe
That is over do it wol n^uer preue
And right as clerkis sayn it is avice
Wherefore in that I hold him lewd and nyce
For when a man has over great a wit
Full often it happith him to mys use it
So does my lord and that me greuith s^re
God it amend I can say no more
Thereof no force good yeman quod our ost
Syn of the konnyng of thy lord thou bost
Tell hou he does tell on now hardely
Syn that he is so crafty and so sly
Where duelle ye if it be to tell tell me
In the subbarbis of ^ town quod he
Lurkinge in hernys and in lanys blind
Where as these robbers and these theuys bekynde
Holden her fereful privy residence
As they that dar not show her presen^^
So fare we if we shall say the sothe
Now quod our ost let me talk tothe
Why art thou so discolourid in thy face
Petir quod he god give it hard grace
I am so vsid the hot fire to blow
That it has chaungid my color I trow
I am not wont in no myrour to prye
But swynke sore and learn multiplye
We bloundryn ever and powryn in the fire
And for all that we faylen of our desir^
For ever we lack our conclusion
To muchel folk we do illusion
And borow gold be it a pound or two
Or ten or twelve or many sommys mo
And make hem wene at lest wey
That of a pound we could make twey
It is false and ay we have good hope
It forto do and aftir it we grope
And this science is so fer us beforn
We mow it not learn though we had it sworn
To over take it. it slit awey so fast
It wol us make beggars at last
While this yeman was thus in his talking
This chanon drew him nere and herd al thing
Which this yeman spak for suspecion
Of mennys speech ever had this chanon
For Caton says he that gilty is
Demyth al thing to be spoke of him ywis
That was the cause he began so nygh draw
To this yeman to herkyn al his saw
And thus he said to his yoman tho
Hold thou thy pees and speak wordis nomo
For if thou do thou shall it dear abye
Thou sklaun drist me here in this company
And eke discuuerist that thou sholdest hyde
Ye quod our ost tell on what so betyde
Of al his thretyng recke thou not a myte
In feith quod he no more I do but a lyte
And when this chanon saw it would not be
But that his yeman would tell his priuyte
He fled awey for verry sorou and shame
A ha quod the yeman here shall rise a game
For it is ernest to me be my feith
That feel y well what that any man says
And yet for all my smert and al my greef
For all my sorou labor and myschyef
I could never leave it in no wise
Now would to god my wit would suffice
To tellyn all that longith to that art
But natheles you wol I tell a part
Syn that my lord is goon I wol not spare
Such thing as I know I wol declare
Here endith the prolog And begins the tale of the Chanons yeman.
WIth this Chanon I duellid.vij. year
And of his science am I never the near
That I had I have lost there by
And god woot so have mo than I
There as I was wont to be right fresh and gay
Of clothinge and of other good array
Now may I were an hose up on mine head
And there my color was both fressh and reed
Now it is wan and of a ledyn hew
Who so it uses sore shall he rewe
And of my swynky blent is mine ye
Lo such advantage it is to multiplye
That slidynge science has made me so bare
That I have no good where that ever I fare
And yet I am endettid so sore there by
Of gold that I borrowed trewly
That while I live I shall it quyte never
Let every man bewar by me for euyr
What manner man that castith him thereto
If he continue I hold his thrift y do
For help me god there by shall he not win
But enpeire his purs and make his wittis thynne
And when he through his madness and folly
Has lost his owen good thorou Iepardy
Than he excitith other folk thereto
To lose her good as he him self has do
For unto shrewis joy it is and ese
To have her felowis in pain and disese
For thus was I onys lernyd of a clerk
Of that no charge I wol ^peke of our werk
When we be there as we shall exercise
Our eluyssh craft we semyn wonder wise
Our termys been so clergial and queynte
I blow the fire til my heart queynte
What should I tell each proporcion
Of thingis which we werkyn up and down
As on.v. or.vj. vncis may well be
Of silver or sum other quantite
And b^sy me to tell you the namys
Of orpement brent bonys Iren squamys
That in to powder ground be full small
And in an erthyn pot how put is al
And salt petir and also papir
Beforne these powdris that I speak of here
And well y couerid with a lamp of glass
And of much other thing which the there was
And of the pottis and glassis enlutynge
That of the eyr mi^hte pass out no thing
And of the fire esy and smert also
Which that was maad and of the care and woo
That he had in our matier sublymynge
And in a malgamynge and Calcenynge
Of quiksiluer I clepid mercury crude
For all our slightis we can not conclude
Our orpement and sublymyd mercury
Our grounden litarge eke on the perfury
Of each of them of vncis a certain
Not helpith us our labor is in veyn
And eek our spiritis assensioun
Ne our matters that liyn al fix adoun
Mow us in our workynge onys auaylle
For lost is al our labor and trauaylle
And the cost a twenty devil wey
Is lost which we on it leye
There is also full many anothir thing
That is to our craft apperteynyng
Though I be order hem reherce ne can
As bool Armoniak veertgrece boras
And sundry vessellis made of earth and glass
Our vrynalis and our descensories

And other such dear ynow a leek
Not nedith it to reherce hem all

And eke of our matirs encorporynge
And of our silver cytrinacion
Our sementynge and also fermentacion
Our Ingottis testes and many mo
I wol you tell as me was taught also
The.iiij. spiritis and the bodies.vij.
Be ordir as y herd my lord neueyn
The first spirit quicsiluer clepid is
The second orpement the thridde ywis
Sal armomak and the fourth brymstone
The bodies seuyn look hem here anon
Sol gold is and luna silver we threpe
Mars Iren Mercury quicsiluer we clepe
Saturnus led and Iu^iter is tyn
And venus copir be my fadir kyn
This cursid craft who wol exercise
Ho shall no good have that he may suffice
For all the good he spendith there about
He lose shall thereof have I no doubt
Who so that listith vttre his folly
Let him com forth and learn to multiplye
And every man that has aught in his cofre
Let him apere and wexe a phi^^sofir
Pressed or Chanon or any other wight
Though he sit at his book day and night
In learning of this eluysshe nyce lore
Al is in veyn and parde mochil more
Is to learn alewd man this subtilte
Fie spek not there of it wol not be
And can he lettrure or can he none
As in effect he shall find it allone
For both two be my sauacion
Concludyn in multiplicacion
Al liche w^el when they have al y ^o
This is to seyn they faylen both two
Yet forgot I to make rehersayll
Of watris corosiff and of lymayll
And of bodijs mollificacion
And also of her induracion
Oylis ablacions metal fusibill
To tell you al it would pass any bibyl
That owhere is therefore as for the lest
Of these namys now wol I me rest
For as I trow I have told y now
To reyse a find al look he never so row
A nay let be the philosophris stoon
Elixer we clepyn we sekyn fast echon
For had we him than were we sikir I now
But unto god of heuyn I make auowe
For all our craft when we have al y do
And al our sleyghte he wol not come us to
He has maad us spend much good
For sorrow thereof almost we wexen wood
But that good hope crepith in our heart
Supposing ever though we sore smerte
To be releuyd by him aftirwarde
Such supposinge I hope is hard
I warn you weel it is to seken euyr
That future temps has made me disseuyr
In trust where of all that ever they had
Yet of that art they konne not wexe sad
For unto hem it is a bittir sweet
So sem^th it for ne had they but a shete
Which that might wrappyn hem ynne a night
And a brate to walkyn ynne be day light
They would it selle and spend it in this craft
They can not stynte til nothing belast
And evermore where euyr that they goon
Men may hem kenne be smell of brymstoon
For all the world they st^nkyn as a goot
Her savor is so ^ammysh and so hoot
That though a man a mile from hem be
The savor wol enfecte hem trustith me
Lo thus by smellyng and thredbare array
If that men list these folk know they may
And if a man wol axe hem privily
Why they be clothid so vnthriftely
Right anon they wol roune in his ere
And sayen if that they aspyed were
Men would hem sle be cause of her science
Lo thus this folk betraien Innocence
Pas over this I go my tale unto
Er that the pot be on the fire ydo
And metallis a certain quantite
My lord hem temprith and noman but he
Now is he goon I dar sey boldly
For as men say he can do craftly
Algate I woot well he has such a name
And yet full often he rennyth in the blame
And white ye how full often it farith so
The pot to brekith and farwell al is do
The metallis been of so greet violence
Our wallis mow not make hem resistance
But if they were wrought of lym and stoon
They persyn so and through the wall they goon
And some of hem synke down in to the ground
Thus have we lost betyme meny a pound
And some ar skaterid all the floor about
Some lepyn into the fire withouten doubt
Though the the fend in our sight him not show
I trow that he with us be that ilke sh^^we
In hell where he is lord and sire
Ne is there more woe rancour ne Ire
When that our pot is broken as I have said
Every man chit and holdith him evil apaid
Some said it was of the fire making
Some said nay it was of the blowynge
Than was y ferd for that was mine office
Straw quod he ye be lewd and nyce
It was not temprid as it ought to be
Nay quoth the fourth stynt and herkenyth me
Be cause our fire was not maad of beche
That is the cause and other none sitheche
I can tell where on it was a long
But well I woot great strif is us among
What quod my lord there is no more to done
Of these parellis I will be waar eftsoon
I am right siker that the pot was crasid
Be as be may be ye not amasid
As usage is leet swepe the floor swithe
Pluk up your hertis and be glad and blithe
The mullok on an heep swepid was
And on the floor cast a Canuas
And all the mullok in a side y throw
And siftid and pikid many a throw
Parde quod on sumwhat of our metal
Yet is there though we have not al
And though this thing mishappid has as now
Anothir time it may be well ynow
We put our good in adventure
A merchant parde may not alwey endure
Tristith me well in his prosperity
Sometime his godis ben drenchid in the se
And sometime it comyth sauf unto land
Pes quod my lord the next time I will fond
To bring our craft al in another plyte
And but I do sirs let me have the wit
There was a defaute in some what well I woot
Anothir said the fire was ouyr hoot
But be it hoot or cold I dar say this
That we concluden ever more amys
We faylen always of that woldyn have
And in our madness ever more we rave
And when we be to gedir euerichone
Every man semyth as wise as Salamon
But althing which that shyneth as gold
It is no gold as I have here told
Ne every appyl that is fair at ye
Nys not good what so ever men cry
Right so it farith amongis us
He that semyth wisest be sweet Jesus
Is most fool when it comyth to the preef
And he that semyth trewist is a thief
That shall ye know or that I from you wonde
Be that my tale be told unto an end
There is a chauon of religion
Amongis us would enfect al a town
Though it were as great as was nynyue
Rome Alisaunder Troy or other three
His sleyghtis and his infinite falsnes
Ne could noman written as I ges
Though that he might live a thousand year
In all the world of falsnes nys his peer
For in his termye he will him so wind
And speak his wordis so slily and so kind
When he comen shall with any wight
That he wol make him dote anon right
But it a fend be as him self is
Full many aman has he begilid er this
And wol if he live may a while
And yet men ride and goon meny a mile
Him forto seek and have his aqueyntaunce
Not knowing of his false governance
And yef you list to give me audience
I will it tell here in your presence
But worshipful chanons religious
Ne demyth not that I slaundir your house
Al though my tale of a Chanon be
Of every order sum shrewe is parde
As god forbede that al a Company
Should rewe a singular mannys folly
To sklaunder you is no thing mine intent
But to correct is that I meant
This tale was not only told for you
But eek for other mo I wot well how
But among cristis apostill twelve
There was no traitor but Judas him selue
Than why should the remenant have a blame
That giltlees were be you I say the same
Save only this if ye wol herkyn me
If any Judas in your covent be
Remeuyth him betymes I you read
If shame or los causyn any dread
And be no thing displesid I you pray
But in this caas herkyn what I say
IN london was a priest annueler
That there ynne had duelt many a year
Which was so plesaunt and so sernisable
Unto the wife where as he was at table
That she would suffer him no thing to pay
For board ne clothing went he never so gay
And spending silver had he right ynow
Whereof no force I wol proceed as now
And tell my tale forth of the chanon
That brought this pressed to confusion
This false Chanon came up on a day
Unto the prestis chambir where he lay
Beseching him to lene him a certain
Of gold and he would quyte him ageyn
Lene me a mark quod he but days three
At my day I will sauns fail quyte it the
And if so be thou find me then falls
Anothir day hang me by the hals
This pressed him took a mark and the as blithe
And this chauon him thankid often sith
And took his leave and went forth his wey
And at thridde day brought his money
And to this pressed he took this gold again
Whereof this priest was wonder glad and fayn
Certis quod he nothing anoieth me
To lene a man an nobil or two or three
Or what thing were in my possessioun
When he is so true of condition
That in no wise he break wol his day
To such a man I can not sey nay
What quod this chanon should I be untrue
Nay that were a thing fallyn of new
Trowthe is a thing that I wol ever keep
In to that day in which I shall crepe
In to my grave or ellis crist forbede
B^leuyth this as sikir as the creed
G^d I thank and in good time be it said
That there nas never man yet evil paid
For gold ne silver that he me lent
Ne never falshede in my heart I mente
And sir quod he now of my priuyte
Syn ye so goodliche have be to me
And kidith to me so great gentilnes
Somewhat to quyte with your kyndenes
I will you show if ye list to here
I wol you teache plener the matere
How I can workyn in philosophye
Take good head ye shul weel seen at ye
That I will a maistrye do or I goo
Ye sir quod the priest and wol ye so
Mary there of y pray you hertely
At your commandment sir trewly
Quod the chanon and ellis crist forbede
Lo how this thief could his seruise be^e
Full soth it is that such profrid s^ruise
Stynketh as witnesses the old wise
And right sone I wol it verifye
In this Chanon rote of al trecherye
That ever more delit has and gladness
Such fendly thoughtis in his heart to expres
How cristis pepyl he may to mischief bring
God keep us from his false dissimulinge
Naught wiste this pressed with whom that he delte
Ne of his harm coming nothing he felt
O sely priest o sely Innocent
With couetyse anon thou shall be blent
O graceles full blind is thy conceit
No thing art thou waar of his disceit
Which that this fox shapen has to the
His wylis his wrenchis thou may not fle
Wherefore to go to the conclusion
That referrith to thy confusion
Unhappy man anon I will me hye
To tellyn thyn vnwit and thy folly
And eke the falsnes of that other wrecche
As ferforth as my conning wol streac^e
This Chanon was my lord ye would wene
Sire in feith and be heaven queen
It was another Chanon and not he
That can an hundrid fold more subtilte
He has betrayed folk meny a time
Of his falsnes it duellith me to ryme
Ever when I speak of his falshede
For shame of him my chekis wexen read
Algatis they begynnen forto glowe
For reednes have I non right well I know
In my visage for fumes diuerce
Of metal which ye have herd me reherce
Consumed and wastid has my reednes
Now takith head of this chanons cursidnes
Sir quod he to the priest let your man goon
For quicsiluer that we had it anoon
And let him bring vncis two or three
And when he comyth as fast ye shul se
A wondir thing which ye saw never or this
Sire quod the priest it shall be do ywis
He bad his servant fette him this thing
And he already was at his biddinge
And sent him forth and came anon ageyn
With this quicsiluer shortly forto seyn
And took the vncis three to the chanon
And he hem leyde well and fair a down
And bad the servant colis forto bring
That he anon might go to his werkynge
The colis right anon were y fet
And this chanon took out a crosselet
Out of his bosom and shewde it to the priest
This instrument quod he which that thou see
Take in thy ^ond and put thy self theryn
Of this qui^siluer an ounce and begin
In the name of crist to wexe a philosophir
There be full few which I would it profre
To show hem thus much of my science
For here shulle ye se by experience
That this quiksiluer I wol mortifye
Right in your sight anon withouten lie
And make it as good silver and as fyn
As there is any in your purs or mine
Or ellis where and make it malliable
And ellis hold me falls and vnstabil
Amongis folk for ever to apere
I have a poudre that cost me dear
Shall make al good for it is cause of al
My conning which I you show shall
Voidith your man and let him be without
And shit the door whylis we be there about
Our priuyte that no man us a spy
Whylis that we work in this phylosofie
Allas as he bad fulfillid was in deed
This ilke servant anon out yede
And his master shitte the door anon
And to her labor spedely they goon
This priest at this cursid Chanons biddyng
Upon the fire anon set this thing
And blew the fire and bisied him full fast
And this Chanon in to the crosselet cast
A powder not I never where of it was
I made of chalk or of earth of glass
Or somewhat ellis was not worth a fly
To blind with this priest and bad him hye
The colis forto couchyn al above
For in tokenyng that I the love
Quod this chanon thyn hondis two
Shul work al thing that here is do
Grant mercy quod the priest and was right glad
And couchid the colis as the Chanon bad
And while he bysy was this fendly wrecche
This false chanon the foul send him fecche
Out of his bosom took a bechyn cole
In which full subtly was made an hole
And there ynne was put of silver ^^mayl
An vn^e and stoppid was withouten fayl
The hole with wex to keep the lymayl in
And vnderstondith that this false gyn
Was not made there but it was maad before
And other thingis that I you tell shall more
Here aftir which that he with him brought
Er he came there him to begyle he thought
And so he deed er that they yede atwyn
Til he had ternyd him he could not twynne
It dullith me when I of him speak
Of his falshede feyn would I me wreke
If I wiste how but here and there
He is variaunt he abides nowhere
But takith head siris for goddis love
He took his cole of which I spak above
And in his hond he bare it privily
And whylis this priest couchid besily
The colis as I you told or this
This Chanon said friend ye do amys
This is not cowchid as it ought to be
But sone it shall amendid be
Now let me meddle therewith but a while
For of you I have pity by saint gyle
Ye be right hoot I se how ye sweet
Have here a oloth and wype alwey the weet
And whylis the pressed wipid his face
This Chanon took his cole with sorry grace
And leyde it above upon the mydwarde
Of the crosselet and blew well aftirward
Till that the colis began fast to brenne
Now give us drink quod the Chanon then
As swithe al shall be well I undertake
Sit we down and let us merry make
And when that this Chanon his bechyn cole
Had brought and the lymayl out of the hole
Into the crosselet it fill anon down
And so it must nedis be resoun
Syn it so euene above couc^i^ was
But thereof wist the priest no thing allas
He demyd all the colis liche good
For of the slighte he no thing understood
And when this alkamystre saw his time
Rise up sire priest he said anon and stond by ^e
And for I woot well yngot have ye non
Goth walkith forth and bryng^th a chalkston^
For I wol make of it the same shappe
That an yngot is if it may hap
And bring eek with you a b^lle or a pan
Full of watir and ye shul well se thanne
How that our besynes shall thryue ^ preue
And yet for ye shall have no mysbeleue
Ne wrong conceyt of me in your absence
I will not be out of your presence
But go with you and com with you again
The chambir door shorltly forto seyn
They opened and shit and went her wey
And forth with hem they took the key
And comen again without any delay
What should I tarry all the long day
He took the chalk and shoop it in the wise
Of an Ingot as I shall you deuyse
I sey he took out of his owen sleue
Ateyn of silver evil moot he cheue
Which that ne was but an ounce of weyghte
And takith head now of his cursid sleyghte
He shoop his Ingot in length and in bread
Of this teyn withouten any dread
So slighly that the priest it not aspied
And in his sleue again he began it hyde
And from the fire he took up his matter
And in the Ingot he put it with merry cheer
And in to the water vessel he it cast
When that him list and bad the priest as fast
Look what there is put in thy hond and grope
Thou shall find there silver as I hope
What devil of hell should it ellis be
Shauyng of silver yes sire parde
He put his hond in and took up ateyne
Of silver fine and glad in every vein
Blithe was this priest when he sy it was so
Goddis blissing and his modris also
And all halowes have ye sire Chanon
Said this priest and I here malison
But and ye vouchesauf to teache it me
This nobil craft and this ^ubtilte
I will be your man in all that ever I may
Quod this Chanon yet wol I make asay
The second time that ye mow take heed
And be expert in this at your need
Anothir day assay in mine absence
This discipline and this crafty science
Let take another ounce quod he tho
Of quycsiluer without wordis mo
And do therewith as ye have do or this
With that other which that silver is
The priest him bisieth all that ever ^e can
To do as this Chanon this cursid man
Comaundid him and fast blew the fire
Forto come to the effect of his desire
And this Chanon right in this mean while
Al ready was this priest forto begile
And for contenaunce in his hond bare
An holow stick take keep and beware
In the end of which was an ounce and more
Of silver lymayl put as said is before
Was in his cole and stoppid with wex weel
Forto keep in his limayl every deel
And while the priest was in his bisynes
This chanon with his stick began it dres
To him anon and his powder cast in
As he deed erst / the devil out of his skyn
Him turn I prey to god for his falshede
For he was ever falls in thought and deed
And with his stick above his crosselet
That was ordained with that falls get
He stirid the colts til al relente began
The wex ayens the fire as every man
But it a fool be woot weel it must need
And all that in the stick was out yede
And in the crosselet hastliche fyl
Now good siris what will ye bet than well
When that this priest was thus begylid ageyn
Supposinge naught but trowthe soth to seyn
He was so glad I can not expres
In no manner his mirthe and his gladness
And to the Chanon he profrid eftsone
Body and good ye quod the chanon anon
Though I be pour crafty thou shall me find
I warn the well yet is thermore behind
Is there any copir here Inn quod he
Ye quod the priest sir I trow there be
Ellis go by us sum and that as swythe
Now good sire go forth thy wey and hye the
He went his wey and with his copir came
And the Chanon in his hond it nam
And of that copir he weyed out an ounce
Al to simple is my tunge to pronounce
As to mynstir of my wit the dulnes
Of this Chanon rote of al cursidnes
He semyd friendly to hem that knew him naught
But he was fendly both in work and thought
It werieth me to tell of his falsnes
And natheles yes wol I it expres
To that intent that men mow bewar thereby
And for non other cause trewly
He put this ounce of copir in his crocelet
And on the fire as swithe he it set
And cast in powder and made the priest to blow
And in his workynge for to stoop low
As he deed er and al was bu^ a Iape
Right as him list the priest he made his ape
And aftir in the yngot he it cast
And in the pan put it at last
Of watir and in he put his owen hond
And in his sleue as ye be forn^ hand
Herd me tell he had of silver a teyne
He slighly took it out this cursid heyn
Vnwetynge of the priest of this false craft
And in the pannys botom he it laft
And in the watir rumbelith to and fro
And wondir privily took it up also
The copir teyn not knowing the priest
And hid it and him hent be the breast
And to him spak and thus he said in game
Stoupith a down be god ye be to blame
Help me now as ye did while eer
Put in your hond and lokith what is there
This priest took up this silver teyn anon
And than said the chanon leet us goon
With these three teynes which the we have wrought
To some goldsmyt^ to look if they be aught
For by my feith I nolde for mine hood
But if it were silver fine and good
And that as swithe preuyd it shall be
Unto the goldsmyth with these teynes three
They went and put hem in assay
To fire and hamyr might no man say nay
But that they were as hem ought to be
This soctid priest who was gladder than he
Was never brid gladder against the day
Ne nyghtyngale in the seson of may
Was never noon that best list to sing
Ne lady lustier in carolinge
Or forto speak of love or wommanhede
Ne knight in armies done a lusty deed
To stonden in grace of his lady dear
Than had this priest this craft forto lere
And to the Chanon thus he spak and said
That for the love of god that for us all deyde
As I may deserve it unto you
What shall this receyt cost tell me now
Be our lord quod this Chanon it is dear
I warn you well save I and a friar
In Engelond can no man it make
No force quod he now sire for goddis sake
What shall I pay tell me I you pray
I wis quod he it is full dear I say
Sire at o word if that it list you have
Ye shul pay.xl. pound so god me save
And nere the friendship that ye did or this
To me should ye pay more ywis
This priest the sum of.xl. pound anon
Of noblis fet and took hem euerichone
To this Chanon for this ilke receipt
Al his workyng was but fraud and disceit
Sire priest he said I keep to have no loos
Of my craft for I wol keep it cloos
And as ye love me keep ye it secre
For if men knew al my subtilte
Be god they would have so great envy
To me be cause of my philosophy
I should be ded there were non other wey
God it forbede quod the pressed what ye sey
Yet had I lever spend all the good
Which that I have or ellis were I wood
Than that ye should fall in such a myschief
Weel sire have ye well good preef
Quod this Chanon and farewell grant mercy
And went his wey and never the p^eest him sy
Aftir that day when that this pressed should
Makyn assay such time as he wold^
Of this receyt farewell it would not be
Lo thus beiapid and begylid was he
Thus makith he his introduction
To bring folk to her destruction
Considerith siris how that in each astat
Betwix men and gold there is debaat
So ferforth that vnnethis is there noon
This multipliynge blindith so many one
That in good feith y trow that it be
The cause grettist of such scarsite
Th^se philosophris spekyn so mistily
In this craft that men can not com thereby
For any wit that men mow have now a dayys
They mow well chateryn as done Iayys
And in her termys settyn her lust and peyn
But to her purpoos shul they never atteyne
A man may lightly learn if he have aught
To multiplye and bring his good to naught
Lo which a lucre is in this lusty game
A mannys mirthe it wol turn unto grame
And empte also great and heavy pursis
And makyn folk forto purchase cursis
Of hem that have her good to hem lent
O fie for shame tho that have be brent
Alas can the^ not ^le the fyris hete
Ye that it use I read that ye it let
Lest that ye l^se al for be^ than never is late
Never to thr^ue were to long date
Though ye pr^lle ever never shul ye it find
Ye be as bold as is baiard the blind
That blundrith forth and paril castith none
He is as bold to run ayens a stone
As forto go besidis in the wey
So faren ye that multiplye I sey
If that your yen can not se a right
Look that your mind lak not his sight
For though that ye look right brood and stare
Ye shul win never of that chaffare
But waste all that ye mow rappe and run
Withdraw the fire lest it to fast brenne
Medlith no more with that art I mean
For if ye do your thrift is gone full clean
And right as swithe I wol you tell here
What Philisophris did in thi^ matere
Lo thus says Arnolde of the new town
As his rosary makith mencioun
He says right thus withouten any lie
There may noman mercury mortif^
But if it be by his brotheris knowlechinge
Lo how that he withsayde this thing
Of philisophris fadir was hermes
He says how that the dragon doutles
Ne dies not but if that he be sleyn
With his brothir and that is f^rto s^yn
Be the dragon mercury and non other
He understands and brymston be his brother
That out of sol and ^una were I d^awe
And therefore said he take heed to my saw
Leet noman bisy him this art forto seche
But he the entencion and the speech
Of philosophris understand can
And if he do he is a lewd man
For this science and this kunnyng said he
Is of the secret of secretis parde
Also there was a discipil of plato
That on a time said his maistir to
As his book homer wol bear witness
And this was his demand in sothfastnes
Tell me the Name of that privy stoon
And plato answered to him anon
Take the stoon that Thitanes men name
Which is that quod he magnacia is the same
Said Plato ye sir is it thus
This is ignotum per ignocius
What is magnacia good sire I you prey
It is a watir that is maad I sey
Of elementis four quod p^ato
Tell me the rote good sir quod he tho
Of that watir if it be your will
Nay nay quod plato certain that I nylle
The philosophris were sworn^ euerichone
That they should discuce it to noon
Ne in no book it writyn in no manner
For unto god it is le^f and dear
For he wol not that it discurid be
But where it likith to his deyte
Man to enspire and eek unto defend
When that him likith lo this is the end
Than conclude I thus since that god of heuyn
Ne wol not that the philisophris neuyn
How that a man shall come unto this stoon
I read as for the best let it goon
For who so makith god his adversary
As forto workyn any thing in contrary
Of his will never shall he thryue
Though that he multiplye term of his live
And there a point for endid is my tale
God send every good man bote of his bale
^Here endith the tale of the Chanons yeman of multiplicaco^n and begins the
tale of the doctor of phisik.
There was as tellith titus liuyns
A knight that clepid was virginius
Fulfilled of honor and of worthynes
Strong of frendis and of riches
A daughter he had be his wyff
And never had he mo in all his lif
Fair was this maid of excellent braute
Abouen every wight that men might se
For nature has with souereyn diligence
Fourmed her in so greet excellence
As though she would say lo I nature
Thus can I form and peynte a creature
When that me list who can me countrefete
Pigmaleon not though he forge and beat
Or grave or peynt for I dar well seyn
A^pollus Zephirus should wirche in veyn
To grave or peynte or forge or beat
If they presumyd me to countirfete
For he that is the fourmour principal
Has maad me his vicair general
To form and peynte eueriche erthly creature
Right as me list for all thing is in my cure
Under the moon that may wane and wexe
And for my werk no thing wol I axe
My lord and I be fully of accord
I made here to the worship of my lord
So do I all mine other creaturis
Of what colors they be or what figuris
Thus semyth me that nature would say
This maid was of.xij. year age and twey
In which that nature had such delit
For right as he can peynte a lily whit
And rody as a rose with such peynture
She peyntid has this nobil creature
Er she was up on her limys fre
Were al so bright as such colouris might be
And Phoebus died had her tressis great
Lik to the stremys of his burnyd hete
And if that excellent was her beauty
A thousand fold more virtuous was she
In her ne lackith no condition
That is to preyse ay be discrecion
As well in body as go^t^ chaste was she
For whi^he she flourid in virginite
With all humyl^te and abstinence
With all attemperaunce and patience
With me^ure eek and beryng of array
Discret she was in answering alwey
She was as wise as pallas dare I seyn
Her facunde eek full womanly and pleyn
None countirfetid termys had she
To seem wise but aftir her degree
She spak and all her wordis more and les
Sownynge in virtue and in gentilnes
Shamefast she was in maidens shamfastnes
Constant in heart and ever in be^ynes
To drive her out of her slogard^y
Bacus had of her mouth no maistrye
For will and thought does venus encr^ce
As men in fire wol cast oil or greece
And of her owen virtue vnconstreynyd
She has full often times here syk feynyd
For that she would fle the company^
Where lightly was to trete of folly
As i^ at festis reuellis and daunsis
That been occasions of daliauncis
Such thyngis make childryn forto be
To sone ripe and bold as men may se
Which is full parlous and has been yore
For all to sone may she learn lore
Of boldness when she is a wife
And ye maistresses in your old lif
That lordis doughtris haven in governance
Ne ^akith of my wordis no displesaunce
Thingis that been set in governance
Of lordis doughtris only for two thingis
Eythir forto keep your honest
Or ellis ye have fall in freelte
And know well y now the old dance
And conne forsake fully myschaunce
For evermore / therefore for cristis sake
Keep well tho that ye have undertake
A thief of veneson that has forlaft
His licorousnesse and al his theuys craft
Can keep a forest best of any man
Now keep hem well for and ye will ye can
Lokith well to no vice that ye assente
L^st ye dampnyd be for your evil entente
For who so does a treytour is certain
And takith head of that I shall seyn
Of all treson souereyn pestilence
Is when a wight betraieth Innocence
Ye fadris and ye modris also
Though ye have childryn one or two
Your is the charge of al her sufferaunce
Whylis they been in ignorance
Bewaar by ensamplis of your living
Other he negligent in chastisinge
That they ne pissh for I dar well seye
If that they do ye shul it dear abeye
Under a shepherde soft and negligent
The wolf has meny a sheep to rent
Suffisith ensaumplis I now as h^re
For I must turn again to my matere
This maid of which I tell expres
She kept her self she nedid no maistres
For in her living maidens might read
As in a book every word in deed
That longith to amayde virtuous
She was so prudent and so bownteuous
For which out sprung on every side
Both of her bounte and of her beauty wide
That through the land they preysen her echone
That loved virtue save envy alone
That sorry is of other mennys w^el
And glad is of his sorrow and vnhele
This doctor makith this discripsion
This maid went in to the town
Toward the tempil with her mother dear
As is of young maidens the manner
Now was there a Justice in the town
That governor was of that region
And so befyl this Judge his yen cast
Up on this maid auising her full fast
As she came forth by there as the Judge stood
Anon his heart chaungid al his mood
So was he caught with beauty of this maid
And to him self full privily he said
This maid shall be mine for any man
Anon the fend in to his heart ran
And taught him suddenly be what sleighte
The maiden to his purpos win he might
For certis by no fors ne by no mede
Him thought he was not abyl forto speed
For she was strong of frendis and eek she
Confermyd was in such souereyn beauty
That well he wiste he might her not win
As forto make her with her body to sin
For which with great deliberacion
He sent aftir a chorl in the town
The which he knew full subtle and full bold
This Judge unto this chorl this tale has told
In secret wise and made him to assure
H^ should tell it to no creature
And if he deed he should lose his head
When assentid was this cursid ded
Glad was the Judge and made glad chere
And yaf him yeftis precious and dear
When shapyn was all this conspirasye
From point to point how that his lecherye
Parfourmyd should be full subtly
As ye shullyn here al openly
Hoom goth this chorl that highte claudius
This false Judge that highte appius
So was his name for it is no fabil
But known for an historial thing notabil
The sentence of it soth is out of doubt
This false Judge goth now fast about
To hastyn his delight all that he may
And so be fyl sone aftir on a day
This false Judge as tellith us the story
As he was wont sat in his consistory
And yaf his domys up on sundry caas
This false chorle came forth a full great paas
And said lord if it be your will
As does me right up on my pitous bille
In which I pleyne up on virginius
And if that he will sey it is not thus
I will preue it and find good witness
That soth is that my bill wol expres
The Judge answerid of this in his absence
I may not give diffinyte sentence
Leet do call him and I wol gladly here
Thou shall have right and no wrong here
Virginius came to here the Justices will
And right anon was red this cursid bill
The sentence was thereof as ye shul here
To you my lord Appius so dear
Shewith your pour servant Claudius
How that a knight callid virginius
Against the law and against al equity
Holdith expres ayens the will of me
My servant which that is my thralle be right
Which from mine house was stolyn on a night
Whylis she was full young I wol it preue
Be witness lord so that ye not grieve
She nys not his daughter what so he say
Wherefore my lord Justice I you pray
Yield me my thral if it be your wi^le
Lo this was all the sentence of his bille
Virginius began up on the chorle behold
But hastlye er ^e his tale told
He would a defendid it as should a knight
And by witness of many a true wight
That al was falls that said his adversary
This cursid Judge would no longer tarry
Ne here a word more of virginius
But yaf his Judgment and said thus
I deem anon this chorl his servant have
Thou shall no longer in thy house her save
Go fet her forth and put her in our ward
This chorle shall have his thral thus I ward
And when this worthy knight virginius
Through the assent of the Judge apius
Mus^e before his dear daughter yeuyn
Unto the Judge in lechery to lyuyn
He goth him hoom and set him in his halle
And let anon his dear daughter call
And with a face ded as asshis cold
Up on her humbil face he began behold
With fadris pite stikyng thorou his heart
Al wol he not from his purpos convert
Daughter quod he virginea by thy name
There been two weyys other death or shame
That thou must suffir allas that I was bore
For never thou deseruest wherefore
To dien with a swerd or with a knyf
O dear daughter which that al my life
I have fostrid up with such plesaunce
That thou ne were out of my remembraunc^
O daughter which that art my last woo
And in my lif my last joy also
O gemme of chastity in patience
Take thou thy death for this is my sentence
For love and not for hate thou must be ded
My petous hond must smite of thy head
Allas that ever Apius the say
Thus has he Iuged the to day
And told her all the caas as ye before
Have herd it nedith to tell no more
Mercy dear fa^ir quod the maid
And with that word she both her armies leyde
Aloute his neck as she was wont to do
The teris brast out of her yen two
And said good fader shall I dye
Is there no grace is there no remedy
No certis dear daughter mine quod he
Than give me leave fadir mine quod she
My death to complain a litil space
For parde Iaffa zaf his daughter grace
Forto complain or he her slow alas
And god it woot no thing was her trespass
But that she ran her fader forto se
To welcome him with great solempnite
And with that word she fyl a swo^ne anon
She risith up and to her fader said
Blissid be god that y shall dye a maid
Yef me my death or that I have a shame
Does with your child your will a goddis name
And with that word she prays full often
That with his swerd he should smite soft
And with that word a swonne down she fyl
Her fadir with sorouful heart and fell
Here head of smoot and by the top it h^nt
And to the Judge he yaf it in present
As he sat in his dome in consistory
When that the Judge it saw as says the story
He bad take him and hang him al so fast
But right anon all the pepil in thraste
To save the knight for rowthe and for pite
For known was the false iniquyte
The pepyl anon had suspect in this thing
By manner of this chorlis iangebing
That it was by assent of appius
They wiste well that he was lecherous
Forthwith unto this appius they gone
And cast him in prison and that anon
Where as he slow him self and Claudius
That servant was unto appius
Was demyd forto be hongid up on a tree
But virginius of his great pity
Prayde for him that he was exilid
And ellis certis had he be begilid
The remenaunt were hongid both more and less
That consentid were to this cursidnes
Here may men se how sin has his merit
Beth waar for noman woot how god wol smite
In no degree ne in no manner wise
The worm of conscience wol a rise
Of wickid lif though it so privy be
That noman woot of but god and he
Whethir that he be lewd man or lerid
He noot how sone he may be a ferid
Therefore I read you this counsel take
Forsake sin or sin you forsake
Here endith the Phisicions tale. And begins the Pardoneris prolog.
Our oste began swear as he were wood
Harow quod he be naylis and be blood
This was a falls thef a curfid Justice
As shameful death as heart can deuyse
So fall on his body and on his bonys
To the devil I betake him attonys
Allas to dear boughte she her beauty
Wherefore I say that al men mow se
That yeftis of fortune and of nature
Been cause of the death of meny a creature
Her beauty was her death I dar well sayn
Allas so pitously as she was slain
But here of wol I not proceed as now
Men have full often more harm than prow
But trewly mine owen master dear
This is a pitous tale forto here
But natheles pass over is no force
I pray to god so save thy gentil co^ps
And thyn vrynals and thy Iourdens
Thyn Ipocras and thyn galtens
And every boy full of letuary
God bliss hem and our lady seynte mary
So mote I the thou art a propir man
And lik a prelat by saint damyan
Thou have spoke enough I can not sey in term
But well I wot thou makist mine heart to erme
That almost I have caught a Cardiakil
Be corpus dominus but if I have tryakil
Or ellis a draughte of corny moysty ale
Or but I here anon amery tale
My heart is lost for pite of this maid
Thou belamy John pardoner he said
Tell us sum mirthis or Iapis right anon
It shall be do he said by saint Runyon
But first quod he here at this ale stake
I wol both drink and ete of a Cake
But right anon these gentiles began to cry
Nay let him tell us of no rebaudrye
Tell us sum moral thing that we mow lere
Some wit and than wol we gladly here
I grant ywis quod he but I must think
Up on sum honest thing whyl^s that I drink
Here endith the Pardoners prolog. And begins the Pardoners tale.
LOrdingis quoth he in chirchis when I preche
I p^yne me to have an haunten speech
Criyng it out as round as goth a belle
For I can be root all that I tell
My teme is ever one and alwey was
Radix malorum est cupiditas
First I pronounce whens that I come
And than my billis show I all and some
Our liege lordis seal is my patent
That show I first my body to warent
That no man be so bold ne priest ne clerk
Me to distourbe of cristis holy werk
And aftir that tell I forth my talis
Bullis of Popis and of Cardinalis
Of Patriarkis and Bisshoppis I show
And in latin I speak wordis a few
To saueryn with my predicacioun
And forto stere men to deuocioun
Then show I forth my long cristal stones
I cramyd in cloutis full of bonys
Relikes they been as wenyn they echon
Than have I in laton a sholdirbon
Which that was an holy iewis sheep
Good men say I take of my wordis keep
If that this boon be wasshe in any well
If kow or calf sheep or ox swelle
That any worm has ete or him stonge
Touch he this boon anon he shall be sound^
And yet also more ferthirmore
Of pokkis and of scabbis and every sore
Shall every sheep be hool that of this well
Drynketh a draughte take keep of that I tell
Wol every wight or that the cook croweth
And would do any thing that him owes
Fasting drink of this well a draughte
As that holy Jew our eldris taught
His bestis and his stoor shall multiplye
And syris also it helith jealousy
And though a man befalle in gelous rage
Leet make with this watir his potage
And never shall he more his wife mystryste
Though he the defaute by her wiste
Al had she take prestis two or three
Here is a meteyn eek ye may se
He that his hond wol put in that meteyn
He s^^l have multiplyyng of his greyn
When ^e has sown be it whete or otys
So that he offer pens or ellis grotis
And men and women o thing warn I you
If o^^ wight be in this church now
That has done sin horrible that he
Dar not for shame shryuyn be
Or any woman be she young or old
That has ymaad her husbond Cokeolde
Such f^lk shall have no power ne grace
To offir to my relikes in this place
And who so fyndith him out of such blame
Comyth up and offir in goddis name
And I assoyle hem by the auctorite
Such as by bull was grauntid me
By this gaude have I won many a year
An hundrid mark syn I was pardoner
I stand lik a clerk in many a Pulpet
And show lewd pepyl and down they set
I preche so as ye have herd before
And tell an hundrid Iapis more
Than pain I me to strecche forth mine neck
And est and west up on the pepyl I beck
As does a dowue sittynge upon a bern^
Mine hondis and my tongue gone so yern^
That it is joy to se my besines
Of avarice and such cursidnes
Is al my prechinge to make hem fre
To give her pens and namely unto me
For mine intent is not but forto win
And no thing for correction of sin
I recke not when that they be beried
Though her soulis goon a blakeberied
For certis many a predicacion
Sowneth often time of euyentencion
Some for plesaunce of folk and for flaterye
To ben auauncid be ypocrisie
And some for veynglory and some for hate
For when I dar not other while debate
Than wol I stynge hem with my tongue smerte
In prechinge so that they shul not as^erte
To ben diffamed falsely if that ^e
Has trespassid other to my bretheryn or me
For though I tell not his proper name
Men shall wol know it is the same
By symonye or by other circumstauncis
Thus quyte I folk that does us displesauncis
Thus spit I out my venym under hew
Of holiness to seem holy and true
But shortly mine intent I wol deuyse
I preche of no thing but of couetyse
Therefore my teme is yet and ever was
Radix oi^m malorum est cupiditas
Thus began I preche the same wise
To such as be vsyng the syn of aueryse
But though my self be gilty in that sin
Yet can I make other folk to twynne
From avarice / and sore to repent
But that is not my principal entente
I preche no thing but for couetyse
Of this matter it ought y now suffyse
Than tell I of ensamplis many on
Of old stories / long time agoon
For lewd pepyl louyn talis old
Which thingis can they weel report and hold
What trow ye whylis that I may preche
And forto win gold and silver forto teache
That I will live in pouert wilfully
Nay nay I thought it never trewly
For I wol preche and beg in sundry londis
I will not do no labor with my hondis
And make baskettis and live thereby
Be cause I wol not beg Idelly
I will non of the apostolis countirfete
Al were it yeuyn of the porest page
Or of the porest widow in a village
Al should her childryn sterue for famyn
Nay I wol drink the licour of the wyn
And have a ioly wenche in every town
But herkeneth lordingis in conclusion
Your likyng is that I shall tell a tale
Now I have drunk a draughte of corny ale
Be god I hope I shall tell you a thing
That ^^al by reason be at your likynge
For though my self be a full vicious man
Amoralle tale yet I you tell can
Which I am wont forto preche and also win
Now hold your pees my tale I wol begin
IN flaundris sumtyme was a company
Of young folk that hauntedyn folly
As riot hazard Stewis and tauernys
And pleye the harlottis in many hernys
They dance and pleye at dyce both day and night
And etyn and drynkyn a bouen her might
Through which they done the devil sacrifise
With ynne the devil tempil in cursid wise
The superfluytees abhominabil
Here othis be so great and dampnabil
That it is grisly forto here hem swear
Our blissid lordis body they to tere
Hem thought the iewis rent him not y nough
And each of hem at other sin lough
And right anon came the Tomble^^eris
Fetis and small and young frutestris
Singars with harpis Bawdis wafreris
Such as been verry the devil officeris
To kyndil and blow the firis of lecherye
That is annexid unto glotonye
The holy wryt take I to witness
That lecherye is in wine and in dronkenesse
Lo how that dronkyn Loath unkindly
Lay be his doughtris two vnwetyngly
So drunk he was he nyste what he wroughte
And therefore sore repent him ought
Herodis who so wol the stories seche
There may ye learn and by ensampil teache
When he of wine was repleet at his feste
Right at his owen tabil yaf his heste
To sle the Baptist John full giltlees
Senek says eke good wordis doutles
He says he can no difference find
Betwix a man that is out of his mind
And a man that is dronkelew
But that woodnes fallyn is in a shrew
Perseuerith longer than does dronkenes
O glotenye full of cursidnes
O cause first of our confusion
O original of our dampnacion
Til crist had bought us with his blood ageyn
Lo how dear and shortly was to seyn
A bought was this cursid vilony
Corupt was all this world thorou glotony
Adam our fader and his wife also
Fro paradys to labor and to woo
Were driven for that vice it is no dread
For whylis that adam fastid as I read
He was in Paradise and when that he
Ete of the fruit defendid on the tree
Anon he was out cast to woo and pain
O glotenye on the ought us well to pleyne
O wiste a man how meny maladies
Folowith of excess and of glotenyes
He should be the more me^urabil
Of his diete sittyng at his tabil
Allas the short throat the tendir mouth
Makith that est and west North and south
In earth in eyr in watir men to swynke
To get a gloton mete and drink
O Poule of this matter well ainst thou entrete
Mete unto womb and womb unto mete
Shall god destroien both as Poule says
Allas a foul thing it is be my feith
To say this word and foulir is the deed
When men so drynkith of the white and read
That of his throat he makith his pryue
Through that cursid superfluyte
The apostil weeping says full petously
There walkyn meny of which you told have I
I say it now wepynhe with pitous vois
That they been enemies of cristis crois
Of which the end is death the womb is her god
O womb o belly o stynkynge ^od
Fulfillid of dung and of corrupcion
At either end of the foul is the soun
How great cost and labor is to find
These cookis how they stamp streyne and grynde
And turn substance in to accident
To fulfille al thy licorous talent
Out of the hard bonys knockyn they
The mary for they cast naught awey
That may go through the golet soft and sote
Of spicery of leuys bark and rote
Shall be his sause ymade by delight
To make him yet an new appetite
But certis he that ^auntith such delicis
Is ded whylis that he liuyth in the vicis
A lecherous thing is wine and dronkenesse
It is full of stryuynge and of wrecchidnesse
O dronken man disfigurid in thy face
Foul is thy breath ^^ul art thou to embeace
And through thyn dronkin nose sownyth thy soun
As though thou saydist ay Sampson Sampsoun
And yet god woot sampson drank never no win
Thou farist as it were a stykid swyn
Thy tongue is lost and al thyn honest curis
For dronkenes is verry sepulturis
Of mannys wit and his discrecion
In whom that drink has dominacion
He can no counsel keep it is no dread
Now keep you fro the white and fro the read
Namely fro the white wine of lepe
That is to selle in fissh street or in chepe
This wine of spain crepith subtly
In other wynys growyng fast by
Of which there risith such fumosite
That when aman has dronkyn draughtis three
And wenyth that he be at tonne in chepe
He is in Spain right at the town of lepe
Not at rochel ne at bordeux town
And than wol he say Sampsoun Sampsoun
But herkenyth lordingis o word I you pray
That all the souereyn actis dar I say
Of victories in the old testament
That thorou very god that is omnipotent
Were done in abstinence and in prayer
Lokith the Bibil and there ye mow it lere
Lokith attilla the great conqueror
Deyde in his sleep with shame and dishonor
Bledynge ay at his nose in dronkenes
A Capteyn should live in sobirnes
And over all this auyse you right weel
What was comaundid unto lamuel
Not Samuel but lamuel say I
Redith the Bibil and find it expressly
Of wine yeuynge to hem that have Justice
No More of this for it may well suffice
ANd now that I have spoke of glote^y
Now wol I defend you sa^ard^y
Hasardrye is very mother of lesyngis
And of disceit cursid forsweryngis also
Of bataylle often time and of other mo
It is repreef and contrary unto honor
Forto beholden a Comune hasardour
And ever the hyer that he is in astat
The more he is holden dissolate
If that a prince use hasardrye
In all governance and al polecye
He is as by comune oppinion
Y hold the less in reputacion
Stillebone that was hold a wise Embassetour
Was sent in to garnathe with great honor
Fro Calidone to make hem aliaunce
And when he came him happith this chance
That all the grettist that were of that lo^d^
Ple^ynge at hasarde he hem fond
For which as soon as that it might be
He stale him hoom ayeen to his contre
And s^yde there will I not lose my name
I wol not take on me so great defame
You forto a lie to non hasardouris
Sendith other wise ambassi^touris
For be my truth me were lever dye
Than I you to hasardouris should a lie
For ye that been so glorious (...) honouris
Shall not a lie you to hasar^ouris
As by my will ne as by my trete
This wise Philosophir thus said he
Look thou use no pley of dyse in thy house
Look eke how the king Emetrus
Sent him a peyre of dyse in scorn^
For he had used hasardrye there be forn^
For which he held his glory and his renoun
At no value as of reputacioun
Lordis mighten find other manner pley
Honest enough to drive the day awey
NOw wol I speak of othis falls and great
A word or two as many books trete
Greet swering is thing abhominabil
And falls swering is a thing more reprouable
The high god forbad swering at all
Witness of Matthew but in special
Of swering says hol^ Iheromye
Thou shall swear soth thyn othis and not lie
And swear in dome and in rightwisnes
But ydil swering is a cursidnes
Behold and se that in the first tabil
Of high goddis hestis honourabil
How that the second heste of him is this
Take not mine name in ydilnes amys
Lo rather he forbedith such swering
Or homycidy or any other cursid thing
I say as be order thus it stondith
This knows they the his hestis v^derstondith
Hou that the second heste of god is that
And furthirmore I will the tell at plat
That vengeance shall not part from the house
That of his othis is outrageous
Ey be goddis precious heart and be his naylis
And be his blood that is in haylis
Seuyn is my chance and thyn is five and three
Ey goddis armies if thou falsely pley with me
This daggar shall through thyn heart go
This fruit comyth of the biochid bonys two
Forsweringe Ire falsnes and homicide
Now for the love of crist that for us did
Leuith your othis both great and small
For cristis sake and herkenyth my tale
These ryotouris three of which I tell
Long or to pryme were ronge any belle
Were set hem in a tavern to drink
And as they sat they herd a belle clynke
Before a cors was carried to his grave
That on of hem began call to his knave
Go bet quod he and axe redily
What cors is this that passith forth by
And look that thou report his name well
Sire quod the boy it nedith never a deel
It was me told or ye came here two houris
He was parde an old fellow of youris
Al suddenly was he sleyn to night
For drunk as he sat on his bench upright
There came a pryue thief men clepe death
That in this contre al pepil sleth
And with his sper he smot his heart in two
And went his wey with out wordis mo
And maistir er ye come in his presence
He has a thousand sleyn this pestelence
Me thinkith it were necessary
Forto bewaar of such an adversary
Death is ready forto mete him evermore
Thus taught me my dame I say no more
O seynte mary said this tauernere
The child says soth for he has this year
Hens over a mile slain in a great village
Both man and woman child and page
I trow his habitacion be there
To been auisid great wisdom it were
Er that he did a man a dishonor
Ye goddis armies said this riotour
Is it such peril with him forto mete
I shall him seek by dale and eke by street
I shall him sle be goddis digne bonys
Harkyn felowis we three been alonys
Let each of us becomyn othris brother
And each of us hold up his hond to other
And we wol sle this traitor death
He shall be slain he that so many sleth
Be goddis dignite or it be night
To gedir have these three her hertis hight
To live and dye ilke of them with other
As though he were his owen swore brothir
And up they stert al drunk in this rage
And forth they goon toward that village
Of which the tauerner has spoke befo^n^
And many a grisly oath have they sworn^
And cristis blissid body they to rent
Death shall be ded if that we may him hente
When they have goon not fully a mile
Right as they would have goon over a style
An old pour man with hem met
This old man full mekely hem grette
And said thus lordingis god you se
The proudest of these riotours three
Answerde what charl with hard grace
Why art thou al forwrappid save thy face
Why l^uyst thou so long in so great age
This old man began look in her visage
And said thus for I can not find
A man though I walk in to ynde
Neither in cite ne in village
That wol change his yonthe for mine age
And therefore must I have mine age still
As long time as it is goddis will
Ne death allas wol not have my life
Thus walk I lik a recheles caytiff
And on the ground which is my modris gate
I knock with my staf erly and late
And say leave modir let me in
Lo how I vanyssh flesh blood and skyn
Allas when shall my honys be at rest
Modir with you would I change my cheste
That in my chambir long time has be
Ye for an heir clout to wrappe ynne me
But yet to me she wol not do that grace
For which full paal and wrecchid is my face
And seris to you it is no courtesy
To speak to an old man vilony
But y trespass other in word or in deed
Ye may your self in holy writ read
Against an old man hoar up on his heed
Ye should a rise wherefore I you read
Ne does to non old man harm now
No More than ye would men did to you
In age if ye should long abide
And god be with you where ye go or ride
I must go thither as I have to do
Nay old chorle be god thou shall not so
Seyde this other hasardour anon
Thou partist not so lightly be saint John
Thou spakist right now of that treitour death
That in this contre al our frendis sleth
Have her my truth thou art his aspye
Tell where he is or thou shall dye
Be god and by the holy sacrement
For shortly thou art one of his assent
To sle us young folk thou falls thief
Now seris if that it be to you leef
To find death turn up this crokid wey
For in that grove I him saw last be my fey
Under a tree and there he wol abide
For your boost he will no thing him hyde
Se ye that Oak right there ye shul him find
God save you that boughte al man kind
And you amend thus said this old man
And every of these riotouris so they ran
Til they came to the tree and there they found
Of floreyns fyn gold I coined round
Well nigh an echte busshellis as hem thought
No lengir than aftir death they sought
But each of them so glad was of that sight
For that the floreyns so fair were and brighte
That down they sat be the precious hord
The worste of hem he spak the first word
Bretheryn quod he take keep what I say
My wit is greet though I bourde and play
This tresour has fortune unto us yeuyn
In mirthe and Iolite our lif to lyuyn
And l^ghtly as it comyth so wol we spend
^y goddis precious dignyte who wend
To day that we should have so fair a grace
But might this gold be carried fro this place
Hoom to my house or ellis unto youris
Than might we say that it were al ouris
Than were we in high felicite
But trew^y by day it man not be
Men would say that we were theuys strong
And for our owen tresour don us honge
This tresour must be carried be night
As wisely and as s^^ly as it might
Wherefore I read leet look among us all
Draw cut let se wh^re that i^ will fall
He that ^ath the shortist cut with heart blithe
Shall run to town and that full swithe
To bring us bred and wine full privily
And two of us shall keep full subtly
This tresour we^^ and if he wol not tarien
When it is night we wol this tresour carien
Be one assent where as us list best
That on of hem brought straw in his fist
And bad him draw and look on whom it would fa^l
And it fyl on the youngest of hem all
And forth toward the town he went anon
And also sone as he was goon
That on of hem spak thus unto that other
Thou wotist well thou art my sworn b^othir
Thy profit wol I tell the right anon
Thou wost well that our fellow is goon
And here is gold and that full great plente
That shall be departid among us three
But natheles if I can shape it so
That it departid were among us two
Had I not done a frendis turn to the
That other answerde y not how it might be
I wot well the gold shall be ouris two
What shul we say what shul we do
Shall it be counsel said the first shrewe
And I shall tell the in wordis few
What we shul do and bring it well about
I grant quod that other out of doubt
That be my truth I wol the not bewrey
Now quod he thou wotist well we be tweye
And tweyne of us shall strenger be than on
Look when he is set and than anon
A rise as though thou woldist with him pleye
And I shall ryue him thorough the sidis tweye
Whilis thou strogelist with him in game
And with thy daggar look thou do the same
And than shall all this gold departid be
My dear friend betwix me and the
Than may we both our lustis fulfille
And pleye at dyse right at our owen will
And thus accordid be these shrewis tweye
To sle the thridde as ye have herd me seye
This youngest which that went to the town
Full often in heart he rollid up and down
The beauty of these floreyns new and bright
O lord quod he if so were that I might
All this tresour win to my self alone
There nys noman that liuyth under trone
Of god that should live as merry as I
And at last the fend our enemy
Put in his heart that he should poison beye
With which he might sle his felowis twey
For why the fend fond him in such living
That he had leave him in sorrow to bring
For this was utterly his intent
To sle hem both and never to repent
And forth he goth no longer would he tarry
In to the town unto apotecary
And prayde him that he would him selle
Some poison that he might his rattis quelle
And eek therewith was a polcat in his hawe
That as he said his capons had slawe
And said he would wreke hem if he might
Of vermyn that destroyde hem be night
The potecary answered thou shall have
A thing as wisly god my soul save
In all this world there is no creature
That etyn or drynkyn has of this confecture
Not but the mounteunce of a corn^ of whete
That he ne shall anon his lif forlete
Ye sterue he shall and that in less while
Or thou wolt go passing half a mile
This poison is so strong and so violent
This cursid man has in his hond it bent
And swithe in to the street unto a man
As fast as ever he might he ran
And borwid him large botellis three
And in to the tweyne the poison pourid he
The thridde he kept clean for his drink
For all night he shoop him forto swynke
In cariynge of this gold. out of this place
And when this riotour with sorry grace
Had fillid full his great botellis three
To his felowis ayeen repayrith he
What nedith it to sermon of it more
For right as they had cast his death before
Right so they have him sleyn right anon
And when this was done than spak that one
Now leet us sit and drink and make us merry
And aftirward we will his body bery
And aftirward it happid him per caas
To take the botel there the poison was
And drank and yaf his fellow drink also
For which anon they steruyn both two
But certis I suppose that Auicenne
Wroot never in no canoun ne in no seen
More wonder sorowis of enpoysonynge
Thus had these wrecchis two her ending
Thus endid ben these homicides two
And the false empoysoner also
O cursid sin full of cursidnes
O traitors homicides o wickidnes
O glotony o luxury o hasardrye
Thou blashemar of crist with vilonye
And oaths great of usage and of pride
Allas mankind how may it betyde
That to thy creator which that the wrought
And with his precious blood the bought
Thou art so falls and so unkind allas
Now good men god foryeue you your trespass
And ware you from the sin of avarice
My holy pardoun may you all warisshe
So that ye offir nobillis or sterlingis
Or ellis silver sponys brochis or ryngis
Bowith your heed under these holy bullis
Comyth up y^ wyuys offrith of your wollis
Your names I enter in my roll anon
Into the bliss of heuyn shall ye goon
I you assoylle be my high power
You that wol offer as clean and as clear
As ye were bore lo seris thus I preche
And Ihesu crist that is our soulis leche
So grant you his pardon to resceyue
For that is best I will you not deceive
But seris o word forgot I in my tale
I have relikes and pardon in my male
As fair as any man in Engelond
Which were me give be the Popis hond
If any of you wol of deuocioun
Offryn and have mine absolucion
Comyth forth anon and knelith here a down
And mekely receives your pardoun
And ye shul have my pardon that ies hende
Or ellis takith pardon as ye wend
Al new and fressh at every tounys end
So that ye offir alwey new and new
Noblis or pens which that been good and true
It is an honor to euerich that is here
That ye mow have a sufficiaunt pardonere
To assoylle you in contre as ye ride
For auenturis which that may betyde
For perauenture there may fall on or two
Down of his horse and break his ne^ke a two
Look which a surete it is to you all
That I am in your feleship y fall
That may assoylle you both more and les
When that the soul shall from the body pas
I read that our ost here shall begin
For he is most inuolupt in sin
Comyth forth sir ost and offrith right anon
And thou shall kiss the relikes euerichon
Ye for a grote vnbokil anon thy purs
Nay nay quod he than have I cristis curs
Let be quod he it shall not be so theche
Thou woldist make me kis thyn old breche
And swear it were a relik of a saint
Though it were with thy fundement I peynt
But by that cross which that saint Eleyn fond
I would I had thy colious in my hond
Instead of relikes other of saintewary
Let cut hem of I wol help the hem to carry
They shul be shryned in an hoggis tord
This pardoner answered not o word
So wroth he was he would no word sey
Now quod our ost I wol no longer pley
With the ne with non other angry man
But right anon the worthy knight began
When that he saw that all the pepyl lough
No More of this for it is right enough
Sir Pardoner be merry and glad of chere
And ye sir ost that be to me so dear
I pray you that ye kiss the pardonere
And pardoner I pray the draw the nere
And as we did let us laughe and pley
Anon they kissid and riden forth her wey
Here endith the Pardoneris tale. And begins the Shipmannys tale.
A Merchant sometime was at saint denis
That rich was wherefore men held him wise
A wife he had of excellent beauty
And compenable and reuelons was she
Which thing causith more dispense
Than worth is all the favor and reverence
That men hem done at festis and at daunsis
Such salutacions and countenauncis
Passin as does a shadow up on a wall
But woe is him that paien must for all
The sely husbonde algate he must pay
He must us both clothe and eek array
For his owen worship full richely
In which array we daunsyn Iolily
And if that he naught pay perauenture
Orellis list not such spencis endure
But thynkith it is wastid and y lost
Than must another pay for our cost
Or lene us gold and that is parlous
This nobil Merchant held a nobil house
For which he had so greet repeir
For his largenes and for his wife was feir
That folly is but herkenyth to my tale
Among all these gestis great and small
There was a monk a fair man and a bold
I trow that.xxx. winter he was old
That ever in one was drawyng to that place
This young monk that was so fair of face
Aqueyntid was so with the good man
Since that their first knowlage began
That in his house as familier was he
As is possible any friend to be
But for as much as this good man
And eke this monk of which I began
Were both two born in on village
The monk of him claymeth for cosinage
And he again says not onys nay
But was as glad there of as foul of day
For to his heart it was a greet plesaunce
Thus been they knyt with etern alliance
And each of hem began other forto ensure
Of brotherhede while that her life may dure
Fre was dane John and namly of dispense
As in that house and full of diligence
To done plesaunce and also great costage
He not foryat to give the least page
When that he came sum manner honest thing
For which they were as glad of his coming
As foul is fayn when son up risith
No More of this for it ^u^fisith
But so be fyl this merchant on a day
Shoop him to make red^ his array
Toward the town of B^uggis forto fare
To byen there aporcioun of ware
For which he had to Paris sent anon
A messanger and praid has dan John
That he should come to saint denis and pl^y
With him and his wife a day or tweye
Er he to Briggis went in all wise
This nobil monk the which I you deuyse
Has of his abbot as him list license
Be cause he was a man of high prudence
And eke an Officer out forto ride
To se her graungis and her bernys wide
And to saint Denis comyth him anon
Who was so welcome as my lord dan John
Our dear cosyn full of courtesy
With him he brought a Iub of maluefie
And eke another full of fyn vernage
And vitayl as was his usage
And thus I let hem drink ete and pleye
This Merchant and this monk a day or tweye
The thridde day the Merchant up risith
And on his nedis sadly him auisith
And up to his countirhous goth he
To rekene with him self well may be
Of that year how that it with him stood
And how that he dispendid had his good
And if encresid he had or none
His bokis and his baggis many one
He leyeth beforn^ him on his countyng board
Full rich was his tresour and his hord
For which full fast his countour he she^te
And eke he would that noman should him let
Of his accountynge for the mean time
And thus he sat til it was passid pryme
Dan John was risen in the morrow also
And in the gardyn walkid to and fro
And said his thingis full coriously
This good wife came walking privily
Into the gardyn there as he walkid soft
And him salewid as she has done often
A maid child came in her company
Which as she list she may govern and gye
For yet under the yerde was the maid
O dear cosyn mine dan John she said
What eylith you so rathe forto rise
Nece quod he it ought enough suffice
Five houris to sleep on a night
But it were for an old pallid wight
As been these old weddid men that lien and dare
As in a form sittith a weary hare
Were al for straught wit houndis great and small
But dear nece why look ye so pale
I trow certis that our good man
Has you labourid since the night began
That you were need to restyn hastily
And with that word he lough full merrily
And with his owen thought wext al reed
This fair wife began shake her head
And said thus ye god woot quod she
Nay cosyn it stondith not so with me
For by that god that yaf me soul and life
In all the r^me of France is there no wife
That less lust has to that sorry play
For y may sing allas and well a wey
That I was born^ but to no wight quod she
Dar I not tell how it stondith with me
Wherefore I think out of this land to wend
Or ellis of my self to make an end
So full am I of dread and of care
This monk began up on this wife to stare
And said allas mine nece god forbede
Ye for any sorrow or for any dread
For do your self / but tell me your greef
Parauenture I may in your myschief
Counsel or help and therefore tellith me
Al your annoye / for it shall secret be
For on my port hose here I make mine oath
That never in my lif for leef ne loath
Ne shall I of no counsel you bewreye
The same quod she to you y seye
Be god and be this portose I you swear
Though men wol me al to pecis tere
Ne shall I never forto go to hell
Bewrey o word of thing that ye me tell
Not for no cosynage / ne alliance
But verily for love / and affiaunce
Thus been they swore and there up on I kissed
And each talkith to other what them list
Cosyn quod she if I had space
As I have none and namly in this place
Than would I tell a legende of my lif
What I have suffrid syn I was wife
With my husbonde al be he your cosyn
Nay quoth this monk by god and by saint Martyn
He is no more Cosyn to me
Than is the leef that hangith on the tree
I clepe him so by saint denis of France
To have of him the more acquaintance
And of you whom I love specially
Above all women sikirly
This swear I you on my professioun
Tellith your greef lest he come down
And hastith you and go awey anon
My dear love quod she o dan John
Full leef were me this counsel to hyde
But out it moot it may no lengir abide
My husbonde is to me the worste man
That ever was since the world began
But since I be came a wife it sittith not me
To tell no wight our priuyte
Neither in bed ne in no place
God shilde I should it tell for his grace
A wife should not seyn of her husbonde
But al honor as I can understand
Save unto you thus muchel I tell shall
As help me god he is not worth at al
In^ no degree the value of a fly
But yet me greuith most his nygardrye
And well ye woot that women naturelly
Desiren thingis as well as do I
They would that her husbondis should be
Hardy and wise / rich and thereto fre
And buxom to his wife and fressh a bed
But by that ilke lord that for us bledde
For his honor my self to array
A sunday next I must nedis pay
An hundrid frankis or ellis I am lore
Yet were I lever to the vnbore
Than me were do disclaunder or vilony
And if my husbonde might it spy
I nere but lost and therefore I you pray
Lene me this fumme or ellis must I dey
Dane John I say lene me this.C. frankis
Parde I wol not fail you my thankis
If that ye list to do that I you pray
For at a certain day I wol you pay
And don to you what plesaunce or seruise
That I shall done right as ye can deuyse
And but I do god take on me vengeance
As foul as ever had genylioun of France
This gentil monk answerde in this manner
Now trewly mine owen lady dear
I have on you quod he so great a routhe
That I you swear and plight my trouth^
That when your husbonde is to flaundris fa^e
I wol deliver you out of this care
For I will bring you an.C. frankis
And with the word he caught her by the shank^s
And here enbraced hard and kiste her often
Goth now your wey quod he al stille and soft
And let us dyne as soon as ye may
For be my kalander it is pryme of the day
Goth now and been as true as I shall be
Now ellis god forbede sir quod she
And forth she goth as ioly as a pie
And bad the cokis that they should hye
So that men might dyne at none
Up to her husbonde is she goon
And knockith at his countour boldly
Who is there quod he Petir it am I
Qu^d she what sire how long wol ye fast
How long time will ye rekyn and cast
Your summys and your bokis and your thingis
The devil have part of all such rekenyngis
Ye have enough parde of goddis sonde
Com down to day and le^t your baggis stand
Ne be ye not a shamyd that dame John
Shall fast^nge all this long day goon
What let us go here amasse and go dyne
Ye quod this man litil can thou deuyne
The cor^ous besin^s that we have
For of us chapmen al so god me save
And by that lord that clepidis saint Iue
Scarcely among twies ten twelve shall thryue
Continuelly lastyng to their age
We may well make chere and good visage
And drive forth the world as it may be
And keep our astat in priu^te
Till we be ded or ellis that we pleye
A pilgremage or goon out of the wey
And therefore have I great necessite
Up on this queynte world to auyse me
For ever more we must stand in dread
Of hap and fortune in our Chapmanhede
To Flaundris wol I go to morrow at day
And come ay^en as soon as ever I may
For which dear wife I the beseke
As be to every wight buxum and meke
And forto keep our good be corious
And honestly govern well our house
Thou have enough in every manner wise
That to a thrifty housold may suffice
The lackid none array ne non vitayl
Of silver in thy purs shall thou not fayll
And with that word his countordore ^e shit
And down he goth he would no longer let
But hastily amasse was there said
And spedely the tablis were leid
And to dinner fast they hem spedde
And richely the chapman this monk fed
And aftir dynere Dan John sobirly
This chapman took a part propirly
And said him thus / cosyn it stondith so
That well I s^ to Briggis wol ye go
God and saint Augustyn speed you and gyde
I pray you cosyn wisely the dir ye ride
Govern you also weel of your diete
Attemperly and namely in this hete
Betwix us two nedith no strange fare
Farwell cosyn god shilde you fro care
And if any thing by day or by night
If it be in my power or in my might
That ye me wol comaunde in any wise
Hit shall be do right as ye wol deuyse
O thing or that ye goon if it may be
I pray you to lene it unto me
An hundrid frankis for a weke or tweye
For certain bestis that I must beye
To store with a place that is owris
^od help me so I would it were youris
I shall not fail surely of my day
Not for a thousand Frankis o mile way
But let this thing be secret I you pray
For ^et this night this bestis must I bey
And fare now well mine owen cosyn dear
Gromercy of your cost and of your chere
This nobi^ merchant and that anon
Answ^rde and said o cosyn mine dan John
Now sikrely this is a small request
My gold is yowris when that ye list
And not only my gold but my chaffare
Take that ye list god shilde that ye spare
But o thing ye kn^we well I nough
Of chapmen that her money is her plough
We may creaunce whiles we have a name
But goldlees forto he it is a shame
Pay it ^yen when it lith at your ese
After my might feign would I you plese
These hundrid frankis fette he forth anon
And privily he took hem to dan John
No wight of all this land wiste of this lone
Saving this merchant and dan John alone
They drink and speak and rome a while and pleye
Til that dan John ridith to his abbeye
The morrow came and forth ridith this merchant
To flan^dris ward his prentis brought him auan^t
Til he com to Briggis well and merrily
Now goth this merchant well and besily
About his nedis and creaunsith and bieth
He neither pleyeth at the dys ne daunsith
But as a merchant shortly to tell
He led his lif and there I let him dwell
The sunday next that this merchant was a gone
To saint denis is common dan John
With croune and berd al fresh and new shave
In all this house there nas so litil a knave
Ne no wight ellis / but he was full fayn
That my lord dan John was common again
And shortly to the point right forto goon
This fair wife acordith with dan John
That for his hundrid frankis he should al night
Have here in his armies bolt up right
With her leggis al so broad and so wide
As of length she may her self stryde
And this accord parfourmyd is in deed
In mirthe al night a besi lif they led
Dan John fidelid on the ribibil
His mynstralsie is swetter than the quynybil
Til it was day that dan John yede his way
And bad the meyne farwell and have good day
For non of hem ne no wight in the town
Has of dan John any suspecioun
And forth he ridith hoom to his abbeye
Or where him list no more of him I sey
This merchant when that endid was the feire
To saint denis he began again repair
And with his wife he makith feste and chere
And tellith here the chaffar is so dear
That nedis must he make a cheuesaunce
For he was bounden in a reconysaunce
To pay twenty thousand sheldis anon
For which this merchant is to paris goon
To borow of certain frendis that he had
A certain of frankis and some with him he ladde
And when that he was come in to the town
For chierte and greet affectioun
Unto dan John he goth first him to pleye
Not forto axe ne borowe of him money
But forto wite and se his welfare
And forto tellyn him of his chaffare
As frendis done when they mete in fere
Dan John him makith feste and merry chere
And he him told ^ul specially
How he had sped by and by
Thankid be god al hool his marchaundise
Save that he must in all manner wise
Makyn a cheuesaunce as for the best
And than he should be in joy and rest
Dan John answerde certis I am fayn
That ye in hele as common home again
And if that I were rich as I have blis
Of.xx. thousand sheldis should ye not mys
For ye so kyndely this other day
Lent me gold and as I can and may
I thank you be god and be saint Iame
But natheles I took it unto our dame
Your wife at hoom the same gold again
Up on your bench she woot it well certain
Be certain tokenys that I can you tell
Now be your leave I may no longer dwell
Our abbot wol out of this town anon
And in his company must I goon
Great well our dame mine owen nece sweet
And farwell dear cosyn til we mete
This merchant which the was full waar and wise
Creaunsid has and paid eke in paris
To certain lumbardis ready in her hond
The sum of gold and gate of hem his bond
And hoom he goth as merry as a popingeay
For weel he knew he stood in such array
That nedis must he win in that viage
A thousand frankis above al his costage
His wife full ready met him at yate
As she was wont of old usage algate
And all that night in mirthe they be set
For he was rich and clearly out of det
When it was day the merchant began embrace
His wife al new and kiste her in the face
And up he goth and makith it full tough
No More quod she be god ye have enough
And wantownly ageyn with him she playde
Till a^te last the merchant thus said
Be god quod he I am a litil wroth
With you my wife al though it be me loath
And woot ye why be god as I guess
That ye have maad a manner strangeness
Betwix me and my Cosyn dan John
Ye should have warned me or I had gone
That he had you an hundrid frankis paid
Be ready token and held him evil apaid
For that I to him spak of cheuesaunce
Me semyd so as by his contenaunce
But natheles be god our heuyn king
I thought to axe of him no thing
I pray the wife do no more so
Tell me now or I fro the go
If any dettour have in mine absence
Y paid the lest be thy negligence
I might him axe a thing that he has paid
This wife was not a ferd ne afraid
But boldly she said and that anon
Mary I diffie that falls monk day John
I keep not of his tokenys never a deel
He took me certain gold that wot I well
What evil the dom on his monkis snowte
For god it woot I wend withouten doubt
That he had give it me be cause of you
To do therewith mine honor and my prow
For cosinage and eke for belechere
That he has had full often times here
But seth I se it stont in such disioynt
I wol answer you shortly to the point
Ye have no slakker dectour than am I
For I wol pay you redely
Fro day to day if so be I faylle
I am your wife skore it up on my tail
And ellis I shall pay as soon as ever I may
For be my truth I have on mine array
And not in wast bestowid it eueridel
And for I have bestowed it so weel
For your honor for goddis sake I sey
As be not worth and let us laughe and pleye
Ye shall my ioly body have to wedde
Be god I wol not pay you but a bed
Forgive it me mine owen spouse dear
Turnyth hithir makith bettir chere
This merchant saw there was non other remedy
And forto chide it were but a folly
Syn that the thing may not other be
Now wife he said and I for give it the
And be thy lif be no more so large
Keep bettir thy good this give I in charge
Thus endith my tale and god us send
Talyng enough unto our lyuys end
Here endith the Shipmannys tale. Verba Hospitis.
Well said by corpus dn^s said our ost
Now long moot thou sail by the cost
Thou gentil master gentil mariner
God give the monk a thousand last quad year
A ha fellows be waar of such a Iape
The monk put in the mannys hood an ape
And in his wyuys eek by saint Austyn
Draws no monks no more to your Inn
But now pas over and let us seek about
Who shall tell a tale first of all this route
Another tale and with that word he said
As curteisly as it had be a maid
My lady Prioresse by your leave
So that I wiste I should you not grieve
I would deem that ye tellyn should
A tale next if so were that ye would
Now will ye vouchesauf my lady dear
Gladly quod she and said as ye shul here
Here begins the Prioresses prolog Domine dn^s noster qua^ admirabile est
nomen tuu^ in vniuersa terra.

But as a child of twelfmonth old of less
That can uneath any word express
Right so fare I and therefore I you pray
Gidith my song as I shall you say
Here endith the Prioresses prolog. And here begins her tale.
There was in asie in a great City
Among cristyn folk a Iurye
Sustained by a lord of that contre
For foul vsurye and lucre of vilony
Hateful to crist and to his company
And through this street men might ride and wend
For it was fre and opyn at every end
A l^til scole of christian folk there stood
Down a^te ferther end in which there were
Childryn an heep common of christian blood
That learned in scole year by year
Such manner doctrine as men vsen here
This is to say to syngen and to read
As small children done in her childhede
Among these childryn was there a widowis son
A litil clergion.vij. year of age
That day by day to scole was his wone
And eke also where that he saw the Image
Of cristis mother had he in usage
As him was taught to knele a down and say
His Aue maria as he goth by the way
Thus has this w^dow har litil sone taught
Our blissed lady cristis mother dear
To worship ay and he forgot it naught
For the s^ly child would alwey sone lere
But ay when I remembrid me on this matere
Saint Nicholas stont ever in my presence
For he so young to crist did reverence
This litil child his litil book learning
As he sat in the scole at his prymere
He Alma redemptoris matter herd sing
As children lernyd here antiphoner
And as he durst he drew him nere and nere
And herkenyd ay the wordis and the note
Til he the first verse could al be rote
Naught wiste he what this latin was to say
For he so young and tender was of age
But on a day his fellow began he pray
To expoune his song and his langage
Or tell him why this song was in usage
This prayde he him to constrew and declare
Full often times up on his knees bare
His fellow which that elder was than he
Answerde him thus this song I have herd sey
Was makid of our blissid lady f^e
Her to salve and eke her forto preye
To be our help and socour when we deye
I can no more expoune in this matere
I learn song I can but litil gramere
And is this song maad in reverence
Of cristis mother said this Innocent
Now certain I wol do my diligence
To conne it al or cristmas is al y went
Though that I for my prymer be shent
And should be beat thries in an hour
I wol it conne our lady to honor
His fellow taught him homward privily
Fro day to day til he could it al be rote
And than he song it well and boldly
Fro word to word according to the note
Twis a day it passid through his throat
To scoleward and homward when he went
On cristis modir set was al his intent
As I have said thorou out the Iurye
This litil child as he came to and fro
Full merrily would he sing and cry
O alma redemptoris matter ever mo
The swetnesse his heart persid so
Of cristis mother that he to her prey
He can not stynte of singinge by the wey
Our first foo the serpent sathanas
That has in Iues heart his waspis nest
Up swal and said o ebreik pepil allas
Is this a thing that is to us honest
That such aboy shall walkyn as him list
In our despit and sing of such sentence
Which is against our laws reverence
Fro thens forth the Iewis have conspirid
This Innocent out of this world to chase
An homicide thereto have they hirid
Right at an aley at a pryue place
And as the child began forth by to pace
This cursid Iue him hent and held fast
And cut his throat and in a pit him cast
I say that in a warderobe they him threw
Where as the Ines purgid her entrayl
O cursid folk of herodis al new
What may your evil intent you auayl
Murdir wol out certain it wol not fayl
And namely as the honor of god shall sprede
The blood out cries on your cursid deed
Martyr sowdid unto virginite
Now may thou sing following ever in on
The white lamb celestial quod she
Of which the great evangelist saint John
In pathmos wroot which says that they goon
Beforn^ this lamb and sing a song al new
That never fleshly woman they ne knew
This pour widow awaytith al night
Aftir her litil child and he came naught
For which as soon as it was days light
With face pale and dread and besy thought
She has at scole and ellis where him sought
Till finally so fer she began to espy
That he last was seyn in the Iurye
With modirs pity in her heart enclosid
She goth as she were half out of her mind
To every place where she has supposid
By liklihede her child for to find
And ever on cristis mother meke and kind
She cryde and at the last thus she wrought
Among the cursid Iues she him sought
She axith and she freyneth pitously
Of every Iue that duellid in that place
To tell her if her child went aught forth by
They said nay but Ihesu of his grace
Yaf in her thought with ynne a litil space
That in that place aftir her son she cryde
Where he was cast in a pit beside
O great god that parfourmyst thy laud
By mouth of Innocentis lo here thy might
This gemme of chastity this emeraud
And eke of martirdom the ruby bright
There he with throat I coruyn lith upright
He Alam redemptoris began to sing
So loud that all the place began ring
The christian folk that by the street went
In came forto wondir up on this thing
And hastily they for the Provost sent
Which fond the child freshly yet bledyng
And herieth crist that is of heuene king
And eke his modir honor of mankind
And aftir that the Iues let he bind
This child with petous lamentacion
Up takyn was synging this song alwey
And with honor and great processioun
They carye him in to the next abbey
His modir swonnyng by his bear lay
Uneath might the pepil that was there
This sorouful rachel meue from the bear
With turment and with shamful death echon
This provost does these Iues forto sterue
That of this murdir wist and that anon
He nolde no such cursidnes observe
Evil shall he have that evil wol deserve
Wherefore with wild horse he did hem draw
And aftir hangid hem by the law
Up on his bear ay lies this Innocent
Before the hy anter while the high mass last
And aftir that the abbot and his covent
Hem spedde forto bery him full fast
And when they holy water on him cast
Yet spak this child when spreynt it was
He sang o Alma redemptoris in the plas
This abbot which that was an holy man
As monks been or ellis ought to be
This young child to conjure he began
And said o dear child I halouse the
In the virtue of the holy trinite
Tell me what is thy cause for to sing
Syn that thy throat is cut to my semynge
My throat is kut unto mine neckeboon
Said this child and as be wey of kind
I should a deide long time agoon
But Ihesu as ye in bokis find
Wol that his glory last and be in mind
And for the worship of his mother dear
Yet may I sing o alma loud and c^ere
This well of mercy cristis mother sweet
I louyd alwey and aftir my konnynge
And when that I my lif should forlete
To me she came and bad me forto sing
This anteme verily in my dyinge
As ye have herd and when that I had song
Me thought she leyde a greyn on my tongue
Wherefore y sing and sing must certain
In honor of that blissed maid fre
Til fro m^ tongue takyn is the greyn
And aftir thus said she to me
My litil child than wol I fecche the
W^^n that the greyn is fro thy tongue I take
Be not aghast I will the not forsake
This holy monk this abbot of him mean I
His tunge out caughte and took awey the greyn
And ^e ^af up the ghost full softely
And when this abbot had this meruayl sayn
His salt teris trillid down as reyn
And groueling he fyl to the ground
And s^ille he lay as he had be y bound
The covent eke lay up on the pament
Weeping and ^er^ying cristis modir dear
And aftir that up they roo^ and forth they went
And took awey this martyr fro his bear
And in a tomb of marbil stonys clear
Enclosyn they this litil body sweet
There he is new god leave us forto mete
O young hew of lincolnn^ slain also
With cursid Iues as it is notabil
For it is but a lityl while a go
Prey eke for us we sinful folk vnstabil
That of his mercy / god so merciable
On us his great mercy multiplye
For reverence of his modir Mary
Here endith the Prioressez tale.
When said was this myrakil every man
As sobir was that wonder was to se
Til that our ost to iapyn began
And than at erst he lokid up on me
And said thus what manner man art thou quoth he
Thou lokist as thou woldist find an hare
For ever up on the ground I se the stare
Approach near and look up merrily
Now ware sirs and let this man have place
He is shape in the wast as well as I
This were a Popet in an arm to embrace
For any woman small and fair of face
He semyth eluyssh be his contenaunce
For unto no wight does he daliaunce
Say now sumwhat syn other folk have said
Tell us a tale of mirthe and that anon
Host quod I ne be not evil apaid
For other tale certain can I noon
But of a ryme I lernyd long a goon
Ye quod he that is good ynow let us ^ere
Some deynte thing me thynkith be thy chere
.Ryme of sir Topas.
LEsten lordis in good intent
And I wol tell verament
Of mirthe and of solace
Of a knight fair and gent
In batayl and in turnament
His name was sir Thopas
I borne he was in fer contre
In Flaundris al be yond the se
At Popering in the place
His fad^r was a man full fre
A lord he was of that contre
As it was goddis grace
Sir Thopas wext a doughty sweyn
Whit was his face as paynemeyn
His lippis read as rose
His rode is lik scarlet in greyn
As I tell you in good certain
He had a semely nose
His here his berd was lik saffron
That to his girdil raught a down
His shoon of cordeweyn
Of briggis were his hosyn broun
His robe was of siclatoun
That cost many a Ian
He could hunte at wild deer
And ride an hawkyng for ryuere
With gray goschauk in hand
Thereto he was a greet archer
Of wrastlyng was there none his peer
There any ram should stand
They moornyd for him par amor
When hem were bet to sleep
But he was chaste and no lechour
And sweet as is the Brembil flour
That berith the read hepe
And so it fill up on a day
For sothe as I you tell may
Sir Thopas would out ride
He word up on his horse bay
And in his hond a launcegay
A long swerd be his side
He prykid thorou a fair forest
There ynne is many a wild best
Ye both buk and hare
And as he pryked north and est
I tell it you him had almest
Betyd a sorry care
There sprongen herbis great and small
The licorice and the Cetuale
And many a cloue gilofer
And notemyg to put in ale
Whethir it be moist or stale
Or forto ley in Cofir
The briddis sing it is no nay
The sperhauke and the Popingeay
That joy was to here
The throstil made eke his lay
The wode dowue up on the spray
He sang full loud and clear
Sir Thopas fill in love longinge
Al when he herd the throstil sing
And prikid as he were wood
Hes fair stead in his prikynge
So swette that men might him wrynge
His sidis were al blood
Sire Thopas eke so weary was
For prikyng in the soft gras
So fires was his courage
That down he leyde him in the place
To make his stead ^um solace
And yaf him good forage
A saint marie benedicite
What aylith this love at me
To bind me so sore
Me dremyd all this night parde
An elf queen should my lady be
And sleep under my goore
An elf queen wol I have ywis
For in this world no woman is
Worthy to be my make in town
Al other women I forsake
And to an elf queen y me take
Be dale and eke be down
And to his sadil he ^lamb anon
And prikid over st^^e and stoon
An elf quen^ to aspye
Til he so long has riden and goon
That he found a privy wone
In the contre of fairy
For in that cuntre was there noon
Neythir wife ne child one
That he had of any dread
Till that there came a great geaunt
His name was sir Ol^phaunt
A parlous man of deed
And said child be termegaunt
But if thou pryke out of mine haunt
Anon I sle thy stead with mace
Here is this queen of fairye
With harp and pype and simphonye
Duellynge in this place
The child said al so mot I the
To morrow will I mete with the
When that I have mine armure
And yet I hope par ma fay
Or it be fully pryme of the day
For here shall thou be slawe
Sir Thopas drew a bak full fast
The geaunt at him stones cast
Ou^ of a fell staf slynge
Bu^ fair ascapid sir Thopas
And al was thorough goddis grace
And thorough his fair berynge
Yet lestenyth lordyng to my tale
Meri^^ than the nyghtyngale
I will with you roun
How ^ir Thopas with sidys sm^le
Prikyng over hill and dale
Is common again to town
His merry men comaundith he
To maken him both game and gle
For nedis must him fight
With a geaunt with heddis three
Full of paramour and iolyte
Of som^e that shoon so bright
Com hithir he said my mynstralis
And gestours for to tell talis
Anon in mine armynge
Of romauncis that been ryal
Of Popis and of Cardinal
And eek of love longyng
They fet him ferst sweet wine
And mede in a masselyne
And ryal spiclory
Of gyngerbred that was so fyn
And licorice and eek common
With sugir that is try
He did next his whit lere
Of cloth of layke fine and clear
A breche and eke a she^te
And next his sherte an haketon
And over that an habergeon
For Persing of his heart
And over that a fyn hanberk
Was al y wrought of Iuys werk
Full strong it was of plate
And over that his cote armure
As whit as is the lily flour
In which he wol debate
His sheld was al of gold so reed
And therynne was a boris head
A karbokil be his side
And there se swoor an ale and bred
How that the Ieaunt shall be ded
Betyde what may be tide
His Iambedeux were of quyreboly
His swerdis shethe of Iuory
His helm of latoun bright
His sadyl was of rewelbone
His bridyl as the son shoon
Or as the moon light
His spear was of fyn Cypress
That bedith werre and no thing pees
The head full sharp y ground
His stead was al dappyl gray
It goth an ambil in the way
Full softely and round
Lo lordis here is o fit
If ye wol any more of it
To tell yet will I fond
NOw hold your mouth pour charity
Both knight and lady fre
And herkenyth to my spelle
Of a bataylle of chyualrye
And of ladies love drury
Anon I will you tell
Men spekyn of romauncis of price
Of hornchild and of Ipotise
Of beues and of sir Guy
Of sir libeuy and of sir playndemour
But sir Thopas berith the flour
Of rial Chyualrye
His good stead he began be stryde
And forth up on his wey he ride
As sparc^e out of bronde
Up on his crest he baar a tour
And there ynne stikid a lily flour
God shilde his body from shonde
And for be was a knight aunterous
He nolde slepyn in none house
But liggen in his hood
His bright helm was his wonger
And b^ him lith his destrer
On herbis fyn and good
Him self drank water of the well
As did the kn^ght sir precyuelle
So worthily under w^ed
NO more quod our ost for goddis dignite
For thou so werry makist me
Of thy verry lewdness
That also wis my soul bles
Mine eris akyn of thy drafty speech
Such another ryme the devil I beteche
This may well be a ryme dogerel quod he
Why so quod I why wolt thou let me
More of my tale than another man
Syn it is the best ryme that I can
Be god quod he full plainly at o word
Thy drafty rymynge is not word a tord
Thou do naught ellis but spendist time
Sir at o word thou shall no lengir ryme
Let se where thou can aught tell in geste
Or tellen in prose sumwhat that the ^ist
In which there may be some mirthe or some doctrine
Gladly quod I be goddis sweet pyne
I wol you tell a litil thing in prose
That ought like you as I suppose
Or ellis certis ye been to dangerous
It is a moral tale virtuous
Albe it told sometime in sundry wise
Of sundry folk as I shall you deuyse
And thus ye woot that every evangelist
That tell us the passion of crist
Ne says not al thing as his fellow does
But natheles her sentence is al soth
And al according as in her sentence
Al be there in her telling difference
For some of hem says more and some less
When they his pitous passion express
I mean of Mark Matthew Luke and John
But doutles her sentence is al on
Therefore lordingis I you beseech
If that ye think I vary in my speech
As thus though that I tell somdeel more
Of prouerbis than ye have herd before
Comprehendid in this litil tretis here
To enforce with the effect of my matere
And though I not the same wordis say
As ye have herd yet to you all I pray
Blames me not for as in my sentence
Shulle ye now here find no difference
For the sentence of this trete lite
Aftir the which merry tale this I write
And therefore harkenyth what I shall say
And let me tell my tale I you pray
Sequitur Chawcers tale.
A Young man that called was Mellebeus the which was mighty and rich / begat a
daughter upon his wife that Called was Prudence which daughter Called was
sophie / Upon a day befyll that he for his disporte went him in to the feldes
for to pleye / His wife and his daughter has he lef^e with in his hows of
which the doors were fast shytte / Three of his old Foes have hit aspied and
setten ladders unto the walls of his hews and by the wyndowes ben entryd in /
and beat his wife / and wo^nded his daughter with five mortel wounds in five
sundry places / that is to say in her feet. in her hondes. in her ^eris^ in
her nose. and in her mouth / And leften her for ded and wenten her way / When
Mellebeus returned was in to his house and saw all this myschief / he like a
mad man rentyng his clothes began to weep and to cry.

Prudence his wif as ferforth as she durst besoughte him of his weping to
stynte / but not forthy he began to weep and cry ever longer the more / This
noble wife prudence remembrid her upon the sentence of Ouyde in his book that
cleped is the remedy of love / where as he says / He is a fool that
distrobleth the mother to weep in the death of her child / til she has wept her
fille as for a certain term / And than shall a man do his diligence with
amyable words her to comfort / And pray her of her weeping to cese / For
which reason this noble wife prudence suffrid her husbond to weep and cry as
for a certain space And when she saw her time / she said to him in this wise
Allas my lord said she why make ye your self for to be like a fool For sothe
hit apperteyneth not to a wise man to make such sorrow your daughter by the
grace of god shall warisshe and escape. And all were hit so that she right now
were deed / y^ ne ought not for her death your self to destroy. Senek says /
the wise man shall not take to great disco^forte for the death of his children /
but certes he should suffer hit in patience as well as he abides the death of his
owen propre person

THis Mellebeus answered anon^ and seide / what man should of his weeping stynte
that has so great cause to weep. Ihesu Crist our lord him self wept for the
death of lazarus his friend. Prudence answerde Certes well I wot a temparate
weeping is nothing defended to him that is sorrowful among folk in sorrow But it
is rather granted him to weep. The apostle Paul unto the rommayns writes /
Many shall rejoice with hem that make joy and weep with such folk as pyne.
But a temperate weeping though it be granted him / Outrageous weeping certes is
defended / Mesure of weeping should be consideryd after the lore that Seneke
techeth us / when that thy friend is deed said he / Let not thyn eyes be to
moist of teerys ne to much dry. Al though thy teerys come to thyn eyes late
hem not fall / And when thou have lost thy friend / do diligently to get the
another friend / And this is better than for to weep for thy friend which thou
have lofte / For th^ryn is no ^ote / And therefore if thou govern the by
sapience put away sorrow out of thy heart.

Remember the that Ihesus sirak says / that a man that is joyous and glad in
heart / hit him comserueth florisshing in age. and sothly sorouful heart makes
his bones dry^ He says eke thus that sorrow in heart sleeth f^l many a man /
Salamon says that right as moththis in the sh^ep flees anoieth the clothes /
And the small worms the trees Right so anoieth sorrow the heart of a man.
Wherefore us ought as well in the death of our children as in the loss of our
goods temporel have patience. Rememberyng on the pacient Job. when he had lost
his children and his tempor^l goods and had endured many a full grievous
temptaco^n Yet said he thus / Our lord has given hit to me / Our lord has
berafte hit me / right so as our lord has welde right so hit is don / y
blessid be the name of our lord.

HO thise forsaid things answered Mellebeus to his wife Prudence all thy words
ben soth said he and thereto profitable / But trewly mine heart is trobled with
this sorrow so grievously that I wot not what to doo^ Late all thy true
friends said prudence and all thy lignage which that been wise come unto the /
and tell to them your caas / And herkene what they say in counceyllyng and
govern you after her sentence / Solomon says work all thy things by
counceyll and thou shall never repent / Than be cause of the counceyll of his
wife Prudence / this Mellebeus let callen a great congregation of folk as
Cirurgiens / Phisiciens / old folk. and young / and some of his old enmyes
reconciled as by their semblance to his love and to his grace and there withal
came som^e of his neyghebour^ that did him reverence more for dread than for
love as hit happeth often / There comen also many subtle flaterers and wise
advocates lernyd in the law / And when thise folk to gider assemblid were /
This Mellebeus showed to hem in sorouful wise his caas / And by the manner of his
speech hit seemed that in his heart he bare a cruel ire ready to do vengeance
upon his foos / And suddenly desired that he should begin the war / But
nevertheless yet axed he their counceyll upon this matter. A cyrurgien^ by
license and assente of such as were wise rose up. And to Mellebeus said as ye
may here.

SIre said he as to us Cirurgiens / hit apperteyneth that we do to every wight
the best that we can do. where as we be withholden and to our pacyente that
we do no dommage / Wherefore hit happeth many time and often That when two men
hauee ^he other wounded one cirurgien^ heleth hem both. Wherefore unto our art
hit is not pertynent to norisshe war / ne parties to supporte / But certes as
to the warisshyng and heelyng of your daughter al be it so that she be
perilously hurt and wounded / we shall do ententyf besynes fro day to day / that
with the grace of god she shall be hool and sound as soon as possible is. Almost
in the same wise the phisiciens answered save that they saiden a few words moo
/ That right as maladyes ben cured be their contraryes / right so shall men
warisshe war by pees. His feyned friends that seemed reconciled and his
flaterers made semblan^t of weeping and emp^yred and grucchid much in this
matter. Preysing greatly Mellebeus of might / Of power of richesse and of friends
/ dispreysing the power of his adversaries And said utterly / that he anon
should wrekyn him on his adusaries beginning war / up roose than an advocate
that was wife / by leave and by counceyll of other that were wise And said
lordynges for the need which we ben assembled in this place / is fu^^ (...)
thing and high matter / be cause of the wrong and of the wik^ednes that has be
done and eke be reason of the great dom^ages that in time coming be possible to
fall for the same / And eke be reason of the great richesse and of the power of
the parties both / For the which hit were a full great paryll to erren in
this matter / Where for Mellebeus this is our entente / We counceylle yow^ above
all thing that right anon thou do diligence in kepinge of thy proper person
in such wise that thou ne want none espy ne wacche. thy body for to save /
And after in thy house we counceylle that thou set sufficient garnyson so as
they may as well thy body as thy house defend / But certes for to meue war
ne suddenly for to do vengeance We may not deem in so litil time that hit should
be prouffytable ^ Wherefore we axen leyser and space to have deliberation in
this caas to deem / For the common proverb says thus / He that sone demeth.
sone shall repent / And eke men say that that Judge is wife that sone
understands a matter and Iugeth beleyzer / For all be hit so that taryeng be
noyeful / Algates it is not to be reproved in yeuyng of Judgment ne in
ven^geance taking when it is sufficient and reasonable / And that showed our
lord Ihesu crist be ensample For when the woman that was taken in avoultrye was
brought in his presence to know what should be do of her person / al be hit
that he wiste well him self what he would do / yet ne wold^ he answer suddenly
but he would have deliberation / and in the grouud he wrote twyes / And be this
cause we axe deliberation And we shall than by the grace of god counceylle you
that thing that is most prouffytable. Up sterte than the young folk a^tones and
the most part of this company have skorned this old wise man and begone to
make noise and saiden. right so as while that iron is hoot men should smite
right so while that this thing is fresshe and new should men wreken her
wrongs. and with a loud voys they cryden war war. Up roose than one of
thise old wise men And made contenance with his hand that men should hold hem
stylle and give him audience / Lordinges said he there is full many a man that
cries war war that wot full lityll what war amounts / war at his
beginning has so great an enter and so large that every wight may enter when
him likes and lightly find war / But certes what end that thereof shall
fall it is not light to know. For sothly when that war is ones begone /
there is full many a child vnborn^ of his mother that shall deye and sterue ^ong
be cause of that war or ellis live in sorrow or deye in wrecchidnesse / And
therefore or any war begin men must have great counceyll and great
deliberation And when this old man wend to have enforced his tale by resons.
well nyghe attones began they all taryse for to break his tale and had full
fast his words tabregge. For sothly who so precheth to hem that have no lust
to here his tale / his words or his sermon anoyeth hem. For Ihesus sirak says
that musyke in weping is a noyous thing / This is as much to say / As much
auaylleth to speak before folk / to whom his speech anoyeth / As it does to
sing before him that wepeth. And when this old man saw that he wanted
audience. al shamefast he set him down again. For Salamon says / There as
thou may have none audyence. ^nforce the not to speak / I see well said this
wise man that the common proverb is soth / That good counceyll wants when hit
is most need.

LEt had this Mellebeus in his counceyll many folk that privily in his ere
cou^ceilled him certain things and counceilled him contrary in general
audience / When Mellebeus saw that the gre^^est part of his counceill were
accorded that he should make war / ^non he condescended to their counceillyng
and fully affermed their sentence.

MY lord said Prudence I you beseech as hertly as I ^ar and can ne haste you
not to fast / And for all guerdons as give me audience / For piers alfons
says who so does to the other good or harm haste the not to acquyte hit / For
in this wise thy friend will abide / And thyn enemy shall the longer live in
dread / The proverb says he hastes well that can abide wisely / And in wikked
haste is no prouffyt.

THis Mellebeus answered to his wife prudence / I purpose not said he to work be
thy counceyll for many causes and resons / For certes every wight would hold me
than a fool / this is to say / if I for thy counceillyng would chan^ge things
that been ordained and affermed by so many wise people / Secondly I say that
all women ben wicked and none good of hem all / For of a thousand men says
Salamon I fond one good / But of all women / certes good woman fond I never
noon / And ^lso certes if I govern me be thy counceyll / hit should seem that I
had give to the over me the maistrye / And god forbede that hit were s^o / For
Ihesus syrak says that if thy wife have the maistrie She is contraryous to her
husbonde And salamon says to thy wif ne to thy child ne to thy friend neuyr
in thy life ne give power over thy self For better it were that thy children axe
of the things that hem needs / than thou se thy self in the hondes of thy
children / and certes if I should work by counceillyng my counceill must be
sometime secret till hit were time that hit must be know / And this may not be
if I should be counceilled by the For women can keep no counceill

When dame Prudence full debonairly and with great patience had herd all that
her husbond liked for to say than axed she of him license for to speak and
said in this wise My lord said she as to your first reason hit may lightly be
answered For I say that hit is no folly to ^han^ge counceill when the thing is
changed or ellis when the thing seems other wise than hit was beforn^ / and
more over I say though that ye have sworn^ and behight to perform your
emprise and be Just cause ye do it not / men should not say therefore that ye
were a liar ne forsworn^ For the book says / that the wise man makes no
lesynge when he torneth his courage to the better And al be it so that your
emprise be establisshid and ordained be great multitude of people / yet dar ye
not accomplyssh that same ordenance but you like / For the truth of things
and the prouffit be rather found i^ few folk that been wise and full of reason
than be great multitude of people where every man clatereth what the him list /
sothli such multitude of people is not honest And to the second reason where as
ye sayn that all wom^en ben wicked / save your grace / Certes ye despise all
women in this wise / and he that all despises / all displeseth as says the
book. and Seneke says who so wole have sapience shall noma^ dispreise But he
shall gladly teache the science that he can without presamption or pride / and
such things as he can not / he shall not be ashamed for to learn hem and
inquire of less folk than him self / And that there has be many a good woman
Hit may be preuyd / For Criste would never descend for to be born of a woman /
if all women had be wicked / And after that for the great bounte that is in
our lord Ihesu crist When he was risen from death to life ^ Apperid rather to a
woman than to his apostles / And though that Salamon said he fond never woman
good / yet follows not therefore that all women ben wicked / For though he
fond no good woman certes many another man has founden many a woman full good
/ and full true / or ellis perauenture thentene of Salamon was this that in
souerain bounte he fond no woman / This is to say / that there is no wight so
good that he ne wants some of the perfection of god that is his maker.

YOur third reason is this / ye say that if ye gouern^ you be my counceyll hit
should seem that ye had give me the maistrye and the lordship over your person
/ Sire save your grace / hit is not so / yef hit so were that noman should be
counceylled but only of hem that had lordship and maistrye of his person /
Men would not be counceylled so often as they ben / For sothly that man that
axeth counceyll of a purpoos / yet has he his fre chois whether he will work
by that counceyll or not. And as to your fourth reason the^^ that ye say that
the Ianglerye of women can not hyde things that they know / as who says a
woman can no^ hyde that she woot. Sir thise wo^des ben to understand of wom^en
that been Iangleresses and wicked / of which wom^en men say / that three
things driven a man sone out of his house / that is to say. smoke. droppyng of
rayn and wicked wives / And of such wom^en says Salamon / that it were better
to dwellen in deserte / than with a wom^an that is ryotous. and sir be your
leave that am not I For ye have full often assaied my great silence and my great
patience And eke how well I can hyden and hele things that men ought secretly
to hyde. And ^othly as to your fyfthe reson^ where that ye say that in wicked
counceill women vaynquyssh men / god wot that reason stands here in no stead
For understand now that ye axe counceyll to do wickedness And if ye wole work
wyckednes. And your wife restrain that wicked purpoos and overcome you by reason
and by good counceyll. Certes your wif ought rather to be praised than to be
blamed. Thus should ye understand the philosophre that wicked wom^en vaynquyshe
her husbondes And there as ye blamen all women and her resons / I shall show be
ensample that they be good and prouffytable. Eke som^e men have said that the
counceyll of women is to dear. or ellis to litil of prys. But al be hit so that
many women be bad / and her counceill evil and nothing worth / yet have men
found full many a good woman / and discrete and wise in counceyllyng Lo Jacob
be the counceyll of his mother rebeca wan the blessyng of ysaac his fader and
the lordship over all his brethern^ Judith be her good counceill deliuerid the
cite of beethule in which she dwelled out of the hands of oliphernes that had
besieged it and would have it destroyed Abigail deliueryd Nabal her husbond fro
david the king that would have slain him And peesid the ire of the kyng^ by her
wit and by her good counceyll / hester be her counceyll enhaunsed greatly the
people of god in the regne of assuerus the king / And the same bounte in good
conceyllyng of many a good woman men may tell / And eke more over when our
lord god had made adam our former fader / he said in this wise / hit is not
good man to be allone / make we to him an help semblable to him self lo here
may ye see that if wom^n were not good and her counceyll good and prouffytable
/ our lo^d god of heaven would never have wrought hem / ne called hem help of
man / but rather confusion of man / And there said ones a clerk in two versis /
What is better than Jasper. wisdom. And what is better than wisdom / woman /
and what is better than good woman / no thing / And so sir by many other resons
may ye s^e that many women been good and their counceyll good and prouffytable
/ And therefore if ye will trust to my counceillyng I shall restore you your
dough^er hool and sound / And eke I will do so much that ye sh^l have h^nour
in this caas / When Melle be had herd the wo^des of his wif Prudence / He
said thus / I see well that the word of Salamon is soth / He says that words
that been spoken discretly by ordenance been honycombes for they give swetenes
to the soul and holsomnes to the body ^ Be cause of thy sweet words and eke
for I have assaied and preuyd thy great sapience and thy great truth I will
govern me by thy counceill in all manner thing / Now sire said dame Prudence /
syn ye vouchesauf to be governed be my counceyll I will inform you how ye shall
govern you in chesing of your counceyll / First to fore all werkis ye shall
beseech the high god that he be your counceyll. And shape you to such entente
that he give you counceyll and comfort. As Thobye taught his sone. At all
times thou shall plese and pray him to dress thy weyes / And look that all
thy counceyll be in him for evermore. Saint Iame eke says / If any of you have
need of sapience Axe hit of god. And after that than shall ye take counceyll in
your self / And examyne well your thoughtys of such things as ye think that been best for your prousfyt / And than shall ye drive away from your hertes tho
things that been contraryous to good counceill / this is to say Ire. couetyse.
and hastynes. First he that axeth counceyll of him self / Certes he must be
withouten ire for many causes / The first is this that he that has great Ire
and wrath in him self. he weneth always to do thing that he may not do. And
secondly he that is Irous and wrathful may not deem well / And he that may not
deem well may not well counceyll. Another is this / that he that is Irous and
wrathful as says seneke may not speak but blameful things / And with his
vicyous words / he steryth other folk to anger and to Ire. And eke sir ye
must drive couetyse out of your heart / For thapostle says that couetyse is
the rote of all harms. And trust well that a covetous man can not deem well
ne think but only to suffylle the end of his couetyse and certes that may
never be accomplysshyd. For evermore the more haboundance a man has of
richesse / the more he desires. And ye must also drive out of your heart
hastynes. For ^ertis ye may not deem for the best hastily a soden thought that
falls in your heart / but ye must auise you on hit full often / For as ye
herd to fore the common proverb ^ which is this / he that sone demeth sone
repents / Sire ye be not always in like disposition / For certes sometime /
such thing as seems that is good for to do / Another time hit seems to you
the contrary / And when ye have take counceill in your self and have demed by
good deliberaco^n ^uche thing as seems you best / Than I counceille you to
keep hit secret / And bewreye not your counceyll to any person but if hit so
be that ye wene sikerly / that thorugh your be wreyng your condition shall be to
you the more prouffytable / For Ihesus sirak says / neither to thy friend / ne
to thy foo discover not thy secret counceyll / ne thy folly / For they will
give the audience / lokyng and supportyng in your presence / And scorn you in
your absence / An other clerk says that scarsely shall thou find any person
that man keep counceyll secretly / The book says whilis that thou kepest thy
counceyll in thy heart / thou kepest hit in thy ^rison And when thou wreyest
hit to any wight he holds the in his snare / And therefore hit is better to
hyde your counceyll in your heart / than pray him to whom ye have bewiryd your
conceyll that he wole keep it cloes and stille For Seneca says / if hit so be
that thou ne may thy counceill hyde / How dare thou pray any other wight to
hyde thy counceyll and keep hit secret. But natheles if thou wene sikerly that
thy bewreyyng of thy counceyll to a person will make thy condition stonden in
the better plight / than shall thou tell him thy counceyll as in this wise /
First thou shall make no semblan^ce whether they were lever pees of werre. or
this or that. ne show him not thy will ne thyn entente / For trust well that
comunly these counceyllours ben flaterers namely the counceyllours of great
lords / For they enforce them always rather to speak plaisan^t words enclynyng
to the lords lust / than words that been true and profitable And therefore
men sayn that the rich man has selde whan^ good counceyll but if he have hit
of him self And after that thou shall considere thy friends and thyn enmyes /
and as touching thy friends thou shall considere which of hem ben most true
wisest. most feythfull. oldest and most approved in counceyllyng And of hem
shall thou axe thy c^unceyll as the caas requires / I say first that ye shall
clepe to your counceyll your friends that been true for Salamon says right as
the heart of a man delyteth in savor that is sweet right so the counceyll of
true friends yeuth swetnesse to the soul / he says also there may no thing be
liknyd to a true friend. For certes gold ne silver be not so much worth as
the good will of a true friend And eke he says that a true friend is a great
defense / who that it finds certes he fyndeth a great tresour / Than shall ye
eke understand if that your true friends ben discrete and wise / for the book
says / Axe always thy counceyll of hem that been wise. And by this same reason
shall ye clepe to your counceyll of your friends / that been of age which that
have seyn many things and ben expert in diverse things and ben appro^^d in
counceylling / For the book says in old men is the sapience and in long time
the prudence. And Tullius Says / That great things ben not ay accomplysshyd
by strength ne be deliuernes of body / but by counceill and by auctorite of
persons and by science / the which three things ne be not feeble by age / but
certes they enforce and encrece day by day / And than shall ye keep this for a
general rewle^. First shall ye clepe to your counceyll a few of your friends
that been special / For Salamon says / Many a friend have thou / but among a
thousand chese the one to be thy counceyllour ^ For all be hit so that thou
first tell thy counceyll to few / thou may after tell thy counceyll to mo
folk if hit be need / But look always that thy counceillours have the three
conditions that I have said beforn^ / that is to say that they be true. wise.
and of old experience / And work not alleway in every need by one counceillour
allone / For sometime hit behooves to be counceylled by many / For Sala^mon
says / Salvation of things is there where be many counceyllours / Now since I
have told you. of which folk that ye should be counceilled / Now will I tell
wh^^^e counceyll ye shall eschew. First ye shall eschew the counce^llyng of
foles / For Salamon says take no counceyll of a fool. For he ne can not
counceylle but after his lust and his affection / The book says that the
properte of a fool is this He troweth harm lightly of every wight / And
lightly troweth all bounte in him self / Ye shall also eschew the counceyllyng
of flaterars / such as enforce hem rather to preyse your person be flaterye
/ than to tell you the soth^fastnes of things. Wherefore Tullius says Among
all the pestelences that been in frendeship / the grettest is fla^te^rye / And
therefore hit is more need to eschew and dread flaterers than any other p^ple /
The book says thou shall rather ^le and deed the sweet words of flaterers
and praysers / than the egre words of thy friend that says to the thy sothes.
Salamon says That the words of a flaterer / is a snare to cacche Innocents /
he says also he that says to his friend words of swetenes and of playsance
sets a net before his feet to cacche him. And therefore says Tullius
Enclyne not thyn ceres to flaterers ne take no counceyll of words of flaterye.
And Caton says Auise the well to eschew words of flaterye. of swetenes and
of playsaunce. And eke thou shall eschew the counceyllyng of thyn old enemies
that been reconsiled. The book says That no wight retorneth in to the grace of
his old enemies saufly. And ysope says Ne trust not to hem with whom thou
have sometime had werre or enemyte / ne tell not hem thy counceyll. And Seneke
tells the cause why it may not be and says where as a great fire has long
time endured / that there ne dwellith some vapor of warmnes. And therefore
says Salamon / In thyn old foo trust thou never. For trewly though thyn
enemy be reconsiled and makes the chere of humylyte and lowteth to the with
his heed / ne trust him never the more / For sykerly he makes that feyned
humylyte more for his owen prouffyt than for the love of thyn owen person. be
cause he demeth the to have victory over his person be such feyned
countenance / The which victory he might not have be stryf ne war. Peter
alfons says / Make no felawship with thyn old enemies For if thou do / they
will peruerten hit to wickedness / And eke thou must esche we the counceill of
such that been thy servants and beren the great reverence. For perauenture
they say more for dread than for love / And therefore says a philosopher in
this wise / There is no wight pa^fightly true to him that he sore dredeth / And
Tullius says / there is no wight so great as an Emperor that long may endure
but if he have more love of his people than dread Thou shall eschew the
counceyll of folk that been drunk ^ lewe / For they can no counceyll hyde /
For Salamon says there is no pryuyte where as regneth dronkenes / Ye shall
always have in suspect such folk as counceyll you one thing pryuely and
counceylle you the contrary openly. Cassiodre says that it is a manner slight
to hyndre / When a man scheweth to do one thing openly and werketh the
contrary pryuely / Thou shall also have in suspect the counceyllyng of wicked
folk / For the book says That the counceyll of wicked folk is alleway full of
fraud. And david says That blysful is that man that has not followed the
counceyll of wicked folk / Thou shall also eschew the counceyllyng of young
folk for her counceyll is not ripe.

NOw sire since I have schewed you all this of which folk ye shall take your
counceyll and of which folk ye shall eschew their counceyll / Nowwole I tell
you how ye shall examyne your counceyll / After the doctrine of Tullius In
examynyng than of your counceyllours ye shall co^sidere many things /
Alderfirst thou shall considere / that in that thing that thou art purposed and
vp^n what thing thou shall have counceyll that very truth be said and
conserved This is to say / tell all trewly thy tale / For he that says falls
/ may not well be counceylled in that caas of the which he lies / And after
this considere three thing that accord to that thou purposist the First for to
do by thy counceyllours if reason accord thereto. And eke if thy might may
atteyne thereto. And if the more part and the better part of thy counceillours
accord thereto or no. Than shall thou co^sidere what thing shall follow of that
con^ceillyng as hate. pees. war grace. prouffyt. or dom^age and many other
things / And of all these things thou shall considere of what rote is engen
dryd the matter of thy counceyll And what fruit it may concern and engendryn^.
Thou shall considere eke all the causes from whens they be sprongen And when
ye have examyned your counceill as I have said and which part is the better
and more prouffytable and have approuyd by many wise folk and old Than shall
thou considere if thou may perform hit and make of hit a good end For reason
would not that any man should begin a thing but if he might perform hit as
him ought / ne noman should take on him so heavy a charge that he might not
bear hit For the proverb says he that to much embracheth distreyueth lityll
And Caton says also Assaye to do such things as thou have power to do / on
less that the charge oppress the to sore / and that the beheueth to weyue
that thing that thou have beg^nne. And if that thou be in doubt whether thou
may perform hit or not / Chese rather to suffer than to begin. and Peter
alfons says / if thou have might to do a thing which thou must repent / hit
is better nay than ye / this is to say that hit is better to hold thy tongue
still than for to speken / Than may thou understand by strenger resons That
if thou have power to perform a work / the which thou shall repent / than
it is better that thou ^uffre than begin Syn they that defenden every wight
to assaye a thing of the which he is in doubt / whether he may perform it or
no And after when ye have examyned your counceyll as I have said beforn^ and
know well that ye may perform your emprise / conferme hit than sadly til it
be at an end.

NOw it is reason said she and time that I show you when and wherefore that ye
may change your counceyllours withouten repreef / Sothly a man may change his
counceille or his purpo^e if the cause cesseth or when an other cause begins
For the law upon things that newly betyden behooves new counceyll. And
Seneca says If that thy connceyll come to the eeris of wicked men thyn enemies
/ change thy counceyll / Thou may also change thy counceyll if so be that
there be error or thou find any other cause harm or dom^age may betyde /
Also if thy counceyll be dishonest or ellis comes of dishonest cause / change
thy counceyll For the law says that all beheestes that been dishonest been of
no valewe / And eke if so be that it be Inpossible or may ^ot goodly be
performed or kept / take this for a general rewle that every counceyll that is
affermed so strongly that it may not be changed for no condition that may
betide / I say that ilke counceyll is wicked.

THis Mellebeus when he herd the doctrine of his wif dame prudence he answered
in this wise. Dame said he as yet in to this time ye have couenably taught me
as in general how I shall govern me in chesyng and with / holdyng of my
counceyllours. But now would I fayn^ that ye would condescende especyall and
tell me how likes or what seems you be our counceyllours that we have chosen
in our present needs.

My lord said she I beseech you in all humblesse that ye will not wilfully
replye against my reason / ne distempre your heart though I speak thing that you
displese^ For god woot that is not mine entente / I speak hit for your best.
for your honor and prouffyt eke And sothly I hope that your benignite will
take it in patience / that your counceyll as in this caas ne should not as to
speak properly be called a con^ceillyng but a momtion or a meuyng folly / in
which counceyll ye have erryd in thassemblyng of your counceyllours For ye
should first have cleped a few folk to your counceyll And after that ye might
have showed to moo folk if hit had be need But certes ye have suddenly cleped
to your counceyll a great multitude of people full chargeant and full anoyous for
to here. Also ye have erryd for there as ye should have cleped to your
counceyll your true friends old and wise / ye have cleped strange folk. false
and flaterers and enemies reconsil^d and folk. that don you reverence without
love. And also ye have erryd for ye have brought with you ire. couetyse and
hastynes / the which three things ben contraryous to every honest counceyll
and profitable / and which three things ye have not amemised ne distroyed
neither in your self ne in your counceyllours as ye ought / ye have erryd also
for ye have shewid to your counceyllours your talent and your affection to make
war anon^ and for to do vengeance / They have aspyed by your menyng to what
thing ye be enclyned / and therefore have they counceylled you rather to your
talente than to your prouffit / ye have erryd also for you seems that it
^uffiseth you to have be counceylled be these counceyllours only and with
lytill a vise / where as in so great need and so hye / hit had be necessary mo
counceyllours / And more deliberaco^n to perform your empryse / ye have errid
also for ye have not examyned your counceyll in the forsaid matter ne in dew
manner as the caas requires / ye have errid for ye have made no deuisyon
betwixe your counceyllours. This is to say Between your friends and your
feyned counceyllours / ne ye have not know the will of your friends old and
wise But ye have cast all her words in an hucchepot / and inclined your
heart to the more part and to the gretter number and be you condescended / And
also ye wot well that men shull always find a gretter part of nombre of
fools than of wise men. And therefore the counceyls that been at congregations
and multitude of folk there as ^^n taken more reward to the nombre than to the
sapience o^ persons Ye see well that in sucche counceyllynges foles have the
maistrye.

MEllebeus answered again I grant well I have errid / but there as thou have
told me here beforn^ that he is not to blame that changes his counceyll in
certain caas and for certain Just causes / I am al ready to chan^ge my
counceyllours right as thou list and as thou will deuyse / The proverb says
that for to do sin is mannysshe But certes for to persevere long in sin
it is a werk of the devil.

TO this sentence answered dame prudence and said Examyne your counceyll and
let us see which of hem have spoken most reasonable and taught you best
counceill And for as much as the examynacion is necessary late us begin at
furgiens and at phisicyens that first speken in this matter / I say you that
the surgyens and the phisiciens have said you discretly as them ought For they
said full wisely / that to the office of hem hit apperteyneth to do to every
wight honor and prouffit / and no wight to ennoye And after their craft do
great diligence unto the cure of hem the which they have in gouerna^ce And
sire right as they have answered wisely and discretly / right so I read you that
they be highly and souereinly gwerdoned for her noble speech. And eke for they
sho^e do the more ententyf besynes in the curacion of your daughter. For all be
it so that they be your friends Therefore shall ye not suffer that they shall
serve you for naught. But ye ought to guerdene hem and show hem largess. And
as touching that the phisicyens encresid in this caas that is to say that in
maladies one contrary is warisshid by another contrary I would fayn know how
ye understood that text and what is your s^ntence / Certes said Mellebeus I
understand that in this wise / that right as they have do me a co^trarious
right / right so should I do hem another. For right as they have venged hem on
me and don me wrong / right so should I venge me on hem and do hem wrong and
than have I cured one contrary by an other contrary / Lo said dame prudence
how lightly is every man enclyned to do his owen desire and his owen plaisance
/ certes said she the words of the phisicyens should not be understand i^ this
wise For certes wickedness is not contrarious to wickedness / ne vengeance to
vengeance ne wrong to wrong but euerych of hem encresid and aggreggith other
/ But certes the words of the phisicyens should be understand in this wise For
good and wickedness be two contraryous / and pees and war / vengeance and
suffraunce / and discord and accord / and many other things / But certes
wickedness shall bewaresshed be goodness / and discord be accord and war be
pees. and so forth be other things. And herto accords saint Poule thappostle
in many places / He says yield not harm to harm ne wicked speech to wicked
speech But do well to him that does the harm and bliss him that says the
harm^ / And in many other places he says and amonessheth pees and accord. But
now wole I speak to you of the counceyll which that was give to you by the men
of law and wise folk that saiden all by one accord as ye have herd / that
over all things ye should do diligence to keep your person and to warnscore
your hows. And saiden also that in this caas ye ought for to werken full
aduysedly and with great discretion and deliberation. And sire as to the first
point that touches the keeping of your person ye shall understand that he that
has war Shall evermore devoutly and mekely beseken and prayen before all
things Ihesu Crist of his mercy that he wole have him in his protection and be
his souerayn helper at his need. For certes in this work there is no wight that
may be counceyllyd ne kept sufficiently without the keeping of our lord Ihesu
crist / To this entente accords the prophet david that says / if god ne
keep the Cite / in ydell waketh he that keeps hit / Now sire than shul ye
committee the keeping of your person to your true friends that been y proved and
known And of them shall ye axe help your person to keep. For Cathon says If
thou have need of help axe hit of thy friend. And after this than shall ye keep
you from all strange folks and fro liars and have always in suspect her
company. For Peter Alfons says / Ne take no company by the way of strange
men^ / but if hit so be that thou have known hem before time / and if so be
that ye have not known him / And will needs fall in thy company perauenture
without thyn assente / enquere than as subtly as thu can or may of his
conversation and of his life before. and feign thy way and say that thou will
go theder as thou wolt not goo / and if he bear a spear hold the on the right
side And if he bear a swerd hold the lift side / and after thus than shul ye
keep you wisely from all such manner people as I have said before and hem and
her counceill eschew. And after this than shall ye kppe you in such manner that
for any presumpco^n of your strength / that ye ne dispyse ne attempt not the
might of your adusarye / and thus beware that ye let not the keeping of your
person for any psumpcion For every wise man dredeth his enemy. And Salamon
says wilful is he that of no thing has dread For certes he that thorugh the
hardynes of his heart or of him self has to great psumpcion / him shall evil
betyde / than shall ye evermore countr^wayte embussh^mentis in special. For
Seneke says the wise man that dredeth harms / escheweth harms / ne he
falls in no peril that peril escheweth. And al be hit so that thou seem
that thou be in syker place / yet shall thou do alleway diligence in kepinge of
thy person / not only from thy grettest enemies but from the least enemy /.
Ouyde says / That the little wesyll wole sle a great bole and the great heart
/ And the book says / That a lytyl thorn^ may prycke the king full sore. And
an hounde will sla^the wild bore / But natheles I say not that thou shall be
so cowarde that thou doubt / where as is no dread / The book says that some
folk have great lust to desceyue But yet they dreden hem to be disceyued.
Thou shall dread to be enpoysoned / And keep the from the company of skorners^
For the book says with scorners make no company / but fle her words as
venym^ / Now as to the second point / where as your wise counceyllours
counceylled you to warnstore your house with great diligence I would fayn know
how that ye understand the words and what is the ^entence. Mellebeus answered
and said / Certes I understand hit in this wise that I shall warnstore my hows
with towers ^uche as be custellis and other manner edifices with armure and
other manner artyllerye by such things which I may my person and my house so
defenden that mine enemies shall be in dread my house for tapproche.

TO this sentence answerde anon prudence / warnsco^ryng said she of great
towers and edifices with great costages and great trauayll And when that they
be accomplisshid yet ben they not worth a straw / but if they ben defended be
true friends that been old and wise / And understand well that the grettest
and strengest garyson that a rich man may have as well to keep his person as
his good / is that he be beloved with his subge^tes and with his neighbors.
For thus says Tullius That there is a manner garyson that noman may v^ynquisshe
ne d^scomfy^e And that is a lord to be beloved of his Cytezeyns and of his
people. Now sir as to your third point / Where as your wise and old
counceillours said that ye ne ought not suddenly ne hastily to proceden in this
need / but that ye oughten to purueye and apparaillen in this caas with great
diligence and great deliberation trewly I trow they saiden right wisely and
right soth. For Tullius says In every need er thou begin / yet appareylle
the with great diligence / Than since than in vengeance taking in war in
battle and in warnstoryng er thou begin I read that thou appareylle the
thereto and do hit with great deliberation. For Tullius says that long
apparayllyng before the battle makes short victory And Cassiodre says /
that the garrison is the strenger when hit is long time aduysed. But now late
us speak of the counceyll that was accorded be your neighbors such as done
you reverence withouten love / your old enemies reconsiled / your flaterers
that counceylle you certain things openly / and pryuely counceylle you the
contrary. The young folk that counceylle you to avenge you and make war anon^.
Certes sire as I have said before ye have greatly erryd to have cleped such
manner of folk to your counceyll / which counceyllours ben enough repreuyd
before said by reason / But natheles late us now descend to the special / ye
shall first proceed after the doctrine of Tullius. Certes the troth of this
matere or of this counceyll needs not dyligently tenquyre. For it is wist well
which they be that have don to you this trespaas and vilonye and how many
trespassours / and in what manner that they have do to you all this wrong and
all this vilonye And after this shall ye examyne the second condico^n Which
that the same Tullius adds in this same matter. For Tullius puts a thing /
which that he calls consenting This is to say / who ben they and which ben
they and how many consenten^ to this counceyll in thy wilfulnes to do hasty
vengeance And leet considere also who be they and how many be they that
consenteden to your adversaries And certes as to the first point it is well
known which folk they be that consented to your hasty wilfulnes For certes
all tho that counceylled you to make sodeyn war be not your friends Let us
now considere which be they that ye holden so greatly your friends as to your
person For all be hit so that ye be so mighty and rich Certes ye be but
allone. For ye have no child but a daughter / Ne ye have no brethern^ ne
cosyns germans ne none other nyghe kynrede / Wherefore that your enemies for
dread should stynte to plete with you or destroyen your person / Ye know also
that your riches must be dispended in diverse parties / And when that every
wight has his ^^rte they ne will take but lityll reward to vengen your death But
your enemies ben three and they have many children. brethern^ Cosyns and other
nyghe kynrede. And though so were that thou baddest slain two or three of hem /
yet dwellen there enough to wreken her death and to sle thy person And though
so be that your kynrede be more syker and steadfast than the kynred of your
adversaries / yet natheles your kynred nys but after kynrede / they be but
lityl ^ubget to you And the kynred of your enemies ben nygh ^ibbe to hem And
certes as in that her condition is better than youris. Than leet us considere
also if that the counceyll of hem that counceylle you to taste sodeyn vengeance
whether hit accord to reason or no / and certes ye know well nay For as by
right or reason there may noman take vengeance on no wight but the Judge that
has the Jurisdiction of hit / when hit is granted him to take that vengeance
hastily or temperatly as the law requires And yet more over of that word that
Tullius says and clepeth consentyng / thou shall considere if thy might and
thy power may consent and susfyse to thy wilfulnes and to thy counceillours
And certes thou may well say nay For s^kerly as for to speak properly we may
do no thing. but only such things as we may do ryghtfully. And certes thou
may rightfully take no vengeance / as of your propre auctorite. Than may ye
see that your power ne cons^nteth ne accords your wyfullnes / Let us examyne
the third point that Tullius clepeth consequent / thou shall understand that
the vengeance that thou purposest to take is consequent. And thereof follows
another vengeance. peril and war and other dom^ages without nombre. of
which we be not were as at this time. and as touching the fourth part that /
Tullius clepeth engendryng / Thou shall consydere that this wrong which is
don to the / is engendryd of the hate of thyn enemies and of vengeance taking
upon hem that wole engendre another vengeance and much sorrow and wastyng of
riches as I said before. Now sire as to the fyfthe point. which that Tullius
clepeth / causes / which is the last point / Thou shall understand that Ilke
wrong that thou have resceyuyd has certain causes which that clerks clepen.
oriens and efficiens and causa loginqua and causa propinqua / this is to say
the fer cause and the nyghe cause / The fer cause is almighty god that is cause
of all things / The near cause is thy three enemies / The cause accidental was
hate / The cause material Is the.v. wounds of thy daughter / The cause formal
is the cause of her worchyng that broughten ladders and clomben in at the
wyndowes. The cause fynall was to sle thy do^ghter hit let not in as much
as in hem was / But for to speak of this fynal cause as to what end they shall
come / or what shall finally betyde of hem in this caas / ne can I not deem But
by coniectyng and supposyng / For we shall suppose that they shall come to a
wicked end / be cause that the book of the decrees says. Selde or with great
pain be causes brought to a good end / when they be badly begone / Now sire
if men would axe me why that god suffers men to do this vilonye / Certes I can
not well answer as f^r no sothfastnes. For thapostle says. That the science
and the Iugementes of our lord god almighty been full deep There may no man
co^prehende ne search hem sufficiently / Natheles by certain psumptions and
coniectyng I hold and bil^^^ That wight that is full of Justice and rightfulnes
has suffrid this to betyde be Just cause and reasonable. Thy name is Mellebe /
This is to say a man that drynketh honey / thou have dronken so much honey of
sweet temporel riches and delices of honor of this world that thou art drunk
and have forgoten Ihesu crist thy creator / Thou ne have don to him such
honor and reverence as thou ought ne thou ne have well taken keep of the
words of Ouyde that says Under the honey of the goods of the body is hid
venym that sleeth the soul / And Salamon says If thou have found honey / ete
of hit that suffyseth. For if thou ete of hit out of me^ure / thou shall spewe
/ and be nedy and pour And parauenture Crist has the in dispyte / and has
turned away fro the his face and his misericorde And also he has suffryd that
thou have be punysshid in the manner that thou have trespassed / Thou have don
sin again our lord Ihesu crist. For certes the three enemies of mankind that
is to say the flessh the fend and the world thou have suffryd hem for to
enter in to thy heart wilfully by the wyndowes of thy body. And have not
defended thy self sufficyently against her assaults and her temptacions / so
that they have wounded thy soul in five places this is to say / the dedely
sins that been entrid in to thy heart be thy five wits. And in this manner
our lord Ihesu Crist has suffryd that thy three enmyes ben entryd in to thy
house by the wyndowes. And have wounded thy daughter in the manner aforesaid.

CErtes said Mellebe I see well that ye enforce you mykyl by words to overcome
me in such manner as I shall not venge me of mine enemies Showing me the peril
and the evil that might befalle of this vengeance / But who so would considere
in all vengeances the peril and the evil that might sewe of vengeance taking
/ a man would never take vengeance / and that were harm / for by vengeance
taking ben wicked men disseuerd from the good men And they that have will to do
wickedness restreyue her wicked purpoos When they see the punysshyng and the
chastysing of the trespassours. And yet say I more / that right as by singular
psumpcion he synneth in taking vengeance of another man right so synneth the
Judge if he take not and do v^ngeance on hem that hit have deseruyd. Senek says
thus / That master he says is good that repreuyd shrewis And cassiodre says
a man dredeth to do outragiously when he woot and knows that it displeseth
the Iuges and soueraynes And another says The Judge that dredeth to do right
makes shrewes. And saint Poule thapostle says how he writes to the romans
that the Iuges bear not the spear with out cause But they bear hit to punysshe
the shrewes and mysdoers / And for to defenden the good men / if ye wole take
vengeance on your enemies ye shall return and have your conrs to the Judge that
has the Jurisdiction upon hem and ye shall punysshe hem as the law axeth and
requires

A said Mellebe this vengeance likes me nothing I bethink me now and take heed how that fortune has norysshid me fro my childhode and help me to pass
man^ a stran^ge paas / Now wole I assaye in her trowyng with gods help that
shall me save for to venge / Certes said Prudence if ye will work be my
counceyll ye shall not assaye fortune by no way / ne ye shall not lene ne bow
unto her after the word of ^eneke / For things that been folily done and that
be done in hope of fortune shall never come to good end / And as to the same
seneke says the more cl^re and the more shynyng that fortune is / the more
b^otyl and the sonner broken she is / Trust ye not in her For there nys no
stedfastnes ne stablenes in her For when thou trowest to be most sure and syker
of her / she will faylle and deceive the And where as ye sayn that fortune has
norisshid you in your chyldhode / I say that there is so mykyll the less
trust in your wit. For Seneke says what man that is norisshed by fortune
she makes him a fool / Now since ye desiren^ and axe vengeance / And the
vengeance that is don after the law and before the Judge likes not you / And
the vengeance that is done in hope of fortune is perylous and uncertain / than
have ye no remedy but for to have your recours unto the souerayn Judge that
vengeth all vilonyes and wrongs And he shall venge you after that him self
witnesses where as he says / leave ye the vengeance unto me and I shall do hit.

MEllebe answered if I venge me not of the vilonnye that men have don unto me I
somone and warn hem that have done to me this vilonye and all other to do me
vilonye / For it is wreton if thou take no vengeance of an old vilonye /
thou somonest thyn aduersarye to do the a new vilonye Also for my susfraunce
men would do me so great vilonye that I might not bear hit ne sustain hit / and
than should I be put and hold over low. For men sayn in mykyl ^uffryng shall
many things fall unto the which thou ne shall mow suffer.

CErtes said dame prudence I grant you well that over much suffraunce is not
good / But yet hit follows not th^rof that every person to whom men do
vilonye to take of hit v^ngeance For that apperteyneth and longs al only to
the Iuges. For they shall venge the vilonyes and the Iniuryes / And therefore the
two auctoritees that ye have said to fore ben alonely understand in the Iuges
For when ye ^uffre over many wrongs and vilanyes to be done withouten
punysshing they semen not a man to do only new wrongs / but they co^manden^
him and bidden him to do sin. And the souerayns and the Iuges in their contre
so my^yl suffer of the shrewes and mysdoers / that they should by ^uche
susfraunce and by process of time wexen of such power and might that they
should put out the Iuges and the souerayns from their places / and at last to
make hem to lose her lordships But let us now put that / that ye have leave to
venge I say ye be not of might ne power as now to venge you For if ye will make
comparison unto the might of your adversaries / ye shall find in many things
that I have showed you or this / that her condition is better than youres And
therefore say I that it is good as now that ye suffer and be pacyent.
Furthermore ye know well that after the comen saw / hit is a wodenes to a man
to strive with a more mighty man than he is him self And for to str^ue with a
man of even strength / that is to say with a man that is as strong as him
self / hit is great peril. And for to strive with a weyker than him / hit is
folly. And therefore should a man fle stryuyng as mykyl as he migh^e For Salamon
says Hit is a great worship to a man to keep him fro noise and stryf And if so
^appe that a man of gretter might and strength than thou art do ^he greuance
/ Study and besye the rather to stynte the same greuance / than for to venge
For seneke says That ^e pu^teth him in great peril that stryueth with a
gre^ter man than he is him self. And Cathon says That if a man of ^yer estate
or degree or of more might than thou art do the anoye or greuance suffer him /
For he that ones has greuyd the may another time releue the and help the /
yet set I caas that ye have a license for to venge you yet ought ye to take heed to all these things aforesaid er that ye take vengeance For I say that
there be full many things that shall restrayn^ you of vengeance taking and make
you for tenclyne to suffer and to have patience in the wrongs that have be
done. First and forward and if ye will considere the defawtes that be in your
owen person. For which defawtes god has suffered you to have all this
tribulation as I have said before to you. For the Poet says / That we oughten
patiently to take the tribulations that comen to us / when we think and
considere that we have deseruyd to have them. And saint Gregory says / that
when a man considers well the nombre of his defautes and sins / the pains
and tribulations that ^e suffr^th semen the less to him And in as much as him
thinks his sins more heavy and grievous in so much s^meth his pain more
lighter and esyer to him / Also ye oughten tenclyne and bow your heart to take
the pacyence of our lord I^esu Crist as says saint Peter in his epistlis Ih^su
Crist he says that suffers for us and yaf ensample to every man to follow and
sue him / for he did never sin Ne never came there out of his mouth vileyns
word / when men cursed him / he curs^d him not / And when men beten him / h^
manass^d him not. Also the great pacyence that saints which that been in
paradyse have had in tribulations that they have suffryd wythouten her deserte
or gylt ought much stire your patience For ye should enforce you to have
patience / Considering the tribulations of this world but lityl while endures
and sone passyd and goon^ / And the Joy that a man seeks by pacyence in
trybulacions is perdurable / After that the Apocalips says in his epistle. The
Joy of god he says is perdur^ble that is to say ^uerlastyng Also trow ye
w^l and eke believe steadfastly that he is not well norysshid ne well taught that
will not have patience ne will not receive patience. For Salamon says That the
doctrine of a man and the wit is known be patience And in another place he
says that he that is pacient governs him by great prudence. and the same
salamon says The angry and the wrathful man makes noyses And the pacient man
attemprith him and stilleth him / he says also / hit is more worth to be
pacyent than for to be right strong / And he tha^ may have the lordship of his
owen heart is more to preyse / than by his force or strength takes great
cytees And therefore says saint Iame in his epistle That patience is a great
virtue of perfection. Certes said Mellebe I grante dame prudence that patience
is a great v^rtu of perfection but every man may not have the perfection that
ye seek / ne I am none of that nombre of right parfight men For my heart may
never be in pees unto the time that ^i^ be venged And al be hit so that hit was
great paryll to mine enemies to do me a viloyne in taking vengeance upon me Yet
took they no head of the paryll but fulfilled their wicked will and courage /
And therefore me thinks men ought not to repreue me / though I put me in a
lityll paryll for to venge me / And though I do a great ^xc^sse That is to
say that I a venge one outrage by another.

A Said dame Prudence ye say your will as you likes But in no caas of the
world a man should not do outrage ne excess for to venge him For cassiodre
says that as evil does he that avengeth him by outrage as h^ that does the
outrage And therefore ye shall venge you after the order of right / that is to
say by the law / and not by excess ne by outrage And also if ye will venge
you of the oultrage of your adversaries in other manner / ye sin / And
therefore says Senek / that a man shall never venge shrewdnes by shrewdnes / and
if that ye say that right axeth a man to defend violence by violence and
fightyng by fightyng / Certes ye say soth. when the defense is don anon
withouten interuall or withouten taryeng or delay for to defend him and not
forto venge him. And yet behooves that a man put such temperance in his
defense that men have no cause ne matter to reproach him that defends him of
oultrage or of excess. For else were it again reason. Parde ye know well that
ye make no defense as now for to defend you / but for to venge you / and so
sueth it that ye have no will to do your will attemp^ratly. And therefore me
thinks that pacyence is good. For Salamon says / That he that is not pacyent
shall have great harm.

CErtes said Mellebe I grant you that when a man is inpaciente and wroth of
that which towcheth him not / and that apperteyneth not to him / though hit
harm him it is no wonder For the law says that he is culpable that
entermeteth or medl^th of thing that apperteyneth not to him. And Salamon says
/ That he that entermeteth him of the noise of stryf of another man / is like
to him that takes a strange hound by the eerys. For right as he that takes a
strange hounde by the eerys / he is otherwhyle byten with the hound / right in
the same wise / it is reason that he have harm that by his Inpacyence medlyth
him of the noise of another man wh^^e as hit apperteyneth not to him But ye
know well that this deed that is to say my grief and my desire touches me
right nygh / and therefore though I be wroth and inpacient it is no meruayll And
saving your grace I can not see that I should greatly harm me though I took
vengeance / For I am richer and more mighty than mine enemies ben and it is well
known that by money and having great possessions ben al things of this world
governed. And also salamon says that all^ thise things obeyen to money. When
prudence had herd her husbonde avaunte him of his riches and of his money
dispreysyng the power of his enemies she spack and said in this wife / Certes
dear sire I grant you that ye be rich and mighty / and that riches ben good
to hem that have gotten hem well and that well can use them / For right as the
body of a man may not live without the soul / no more may the life without
temporel goods And by richesse may a man get him great friends / And therefore
says pamphil^s if an erlis daughter be rich he says she may chese of a
thousand men whom she will take to her husbonde. For of a thousand men one will
not forsake her And this pamphiles says also if that thou be right happy that
is to say if thou be rich thou shall find a great nombre of felaws and
friends. and if thy fortune change farewell friendship and felawship for thou
shall be allone without any company / but if hit be the company of pour
folk. And yet says this pamphiles more over / that they that ^en bond and
thral of lignage shull be made worthy and noble by richesse. And right so as by
richesse there comen many goods / right ^o by pouerte there comen many harms
and euylles And therefore clepeth cassi^dre pouerte the mother of ruin / that is
to say the mother of ouerthrowyng or of fullyng down And therefore says Peter
alfons / one of the grettest aduersitees of this world is when a freman of
kind or of birthe is constreyned be pouerte to ete the alms of his enemy.
And the same says Innocence in one of his books that sorrowful and myshappy
is the condition of a pour beggar For if he axe not his mete / he dies for
hunger. And if he axe he dies for shame / and algate necessite constreyneth
him to axe. And therefore says Salamon That better it is to dye than to have
such pouerte. And as the same salamon says better it is to dye a bitter death
than to live such a life / Be these resons that I have said unto you and by
many other that I could say I grant that richesse ben good to hem that get
hem well and to tho that use well this richesse And therefore wole I show you /
how ye shall behave you in gadryng of your richesse / and in what manner ye shall
use them First ye shall get hem withouten great desire / by good leyzer
sokyngly and not over hastily. For a man that is to desiring in getyng riches
haboundeth him first to theft and to all other mysrewles And therefore says
salamon ^e that hastes him to bes^ly to wexe rich he shall be none Innocent /
he says also that the riches that hastily comes to a man / soon and hastily
goth and passes from a man But that riches that comes lityll and a lityll
wexeth always and multeplieth And therefore ye shall get riches by your wit and
by your trauayll unto your prouffit / and that withouten any wrong and harm
doing to any other person. For the law says there makes noman him self rich
if he do harm to another wight / this is to say that nature defends and
forbedeth by right that no man make him rich unto the harm of an other
person. And Tullius says that no sorrow ne dread of death ne of thing that may
befalle unto man is so much again nature as a man to encrecen his owen
prouffit to the harm of an other man. and though that great and mighty men get
riches more lightly than thou / yet shall thou not be idle But show to do thy
prouffyt / For thou shall in all wise fle ydlenes. For salamon says That he
that trauaylleth in ydlenes techeth a man to do many euyllys And the same
Salamon says He that traueilleth and besieth him to tyle his land shall ete
bread. and he that is idle and casts him to no besynes ne ocupation shall
fall in to pouerte and dye for hunger. And he that is idle and slow can never
find couenable time for to do his prouffyt For there is a versifyer says. That
the idle man excuses him in winter be cause of the great cold and in somer by
encheson of hete / For these causes says Cathon waketh and enclineth you. not
over my kill to sleep / For ouermoche rest norissheth and causes many vices.
And therefore says saint Jerome ^ does some good deeds that the devil which
that is your enemy ^ynde you not vnocupyed. For the devil takes not lightly
to his worching such as he fyndeth ocupied in good work Than thus in getyng
of riches ye must fle ydlenes. and afterward ye shall vsen the riches which
ye have gotten by your wit and by your trauayll in such manner that men h^lde
you not to scarce ne to sparyng ne to fool large that is to say over large a
spendir. For right as men blame an auerycyous man be cause of his scarsenes and
chyncherye / in the same wise is he to blame that spends over largely. And
therefore Caton says use thy riches that thou have gotten in such manner as men
have no matere ne cause to say ne call the neither wrecche ne chynche For it
is a great shame to a man to have a pour heart and a rich purs He says also
the goods that thou have gotten use hem be mesure that is to say spend them
mesurably. For they that folily spenden and wasten the goods that they have /
when they have no more propre of their owen / they shapen hem to take the goods
of other men. I say than that ye shall flee auaryce vsyng your riches in such
manner that men say not that your riches is devoured / but that ye have hem in
your might and in your weldyng. For the wise man repreuyth the auarycious man
and says thus in two versis Whereto and why buryeth a man his owen goods be
his great auaryce and knows well that needs must he dye. For death is the end
of every man as in this present life. And for what cause and encheson Joins or
knytteth he him so fast to his goods / that all his wits mow not
dysseuere ne depart him from his goodis. And knows well or ought to know
that when he is deed / he shall nothing bear with him out of this world. And
therefore says saint Augustyn. that the auerycyous man is lykenyd unto hell /
that the more hit swaloweth the more it desires to swolowe and to devour /
And as well as ye would eschew to be called an auaricyous man or a chynche / as
well should ye kept you and govern you in such wise that men clepe you not
fol^ large. Therefore says Tullius / The goods of thyn house ne should not be
hid ne kept so cloos but that they might be opend be pity and be debonairte /
that is to say to give hem part that have great need. Ne thy goods should not
be so open to be every man's goods / Afterward in getyng of your richesse and
vsyng hem ye shall always have three things in your heart. That is to say our
lord god. good conscience. and good name. First ye shall have god in your heart.
and for no riches ye shall do no thing which may in any manner wise displese god
that is our creator and maker After the word of salamon / hit is better to
have a litil good with the love of god than for to have much gold and tresour
and to lose the love of his lord god. And the prop^ete says that better it is
to be a good man and have litil good and tresour / than to beholden a shrewe
and have great richesse And yet say I furthermore that ye shall always do your
besynes to get you riches so that ye get hem with good conscience. And the
appostle says that there nys no thing in this world of which we shall have so
great Joy as when our conscience berith us good witness And the wise man says
that the substance of a man is full good when sin is not in man's conscience.
Afterward in getyng of your richesse and in vsyng of them ye must have great
besynes and diligence that your good name be always kept and conserved. For
Salamon says That better is and more it avaylleth a man for to have a good
name than for to have many riches. And therefore he says in an other place / do
great diligence in keeping of thy friend and in keeping of thy good name For hit
shall longer abide with the than any other tresour be it never so precious. And
certes he should not be called a gentylman that after god and good conscience
all things left ne does to keep his good name. And cassiodre says that it
is sign of a gentil heart when a man loves and desires to have a good name.
And therefore says saint Augustyn / that there be two things the be necessary
and needful / that is good conscience and good loos And he that trusts him
so mikyl in his good conscience that he despises and sets at naught his
good name or loos he does not well / For he that rekketh not to keep his good
name nys but a cruel chorle / Sire now have I showed you ^ow ^e should do in
geting of riches and how ye should use hem And I see well that for the trust that
ye have in your riches ^e wok meue war and bataille I con^ceille you that ye
begin no war in trust of your riches For they suffice not wars to
maintene. And therefore says a philosophre / that man that desires algate and
will have war shall never have suffysan^ce. For the richer that he is the
gretter dispense must he make if he will have worship and victory. And salamon
says That the gretter riches that a man has the more dispense he has. And
therefore al be hit so that be fortune and riches ye may have many folk / yet
behooves it not ne it is not good to begin war / where that ye may have in
other manner pees unto your worship and prouffyt. For the victoryes that been of
bataille in this world / ben not in great nombre and multitude of people ne in
virtue of man / but hit lies in the will and in the hand of our lord Ihesu god
almighty. And therefore Judas machabeus which that was gods knight. when he
should fight against his adversaries that had a gretter nombre and gretter
multitude of people and strenger than was the people of Machabee / yet he
recomforted his lityl people and said right in this wise Also lightly said he
may our lord god give victory to a few folk as to many folk / For the
victory of a bataill comes not by a great nombre of people but hit comes from
our lord god of heaven And dear sire for as much as there is noman certain that
he be worthy that god wole give him victory or not. Salamon says / Therefore
every man should greatly dread warris to begin and be cause that in bataill
fall many paryls And happeth otherwhile that also soon is a great man slain
as a litil man. And as is wreton in the second book of kings / the deeds of
bataill ben aventurous and no thing certain / For as lightly is one hurt with
a spear as an other / And for there is great paryll in war therefore should a
man eschew and flee war in as mykyll as a man may goodly. For Salamon says
He that louyth paryll shall fall in paryll. After that dame prudence had spaken
in this matter Melle^ee answered and said I ^ee well dame prudence that by fair
words and by your resons that ye have showed me / that war likes you no
thing / but I have not herd yet in this counceyll / how I shall do in this
need. Certes said she I counceylle you that ye accord with your adversaries
that ye have pees with hem For saint Iame says in his epistlis That by acorde
and pees the small riches wexe great And by debate and discord the great
richesse fallen down and faillen / And ye know well that one of the grettest
and most souerayn thing that is in this world is unity and pees. And therefore
says our lord Ihesu Crist to his apostlis in this wise well happy and blessed
be tho that louen and purchacen pees. For they be called children of god. A
said Mellebe now see I well that ye love not mine honor ne my worship Ye known
that mine adversaries have begone this debate And ye see well that they ne
require ne pray me of pees ne they axe not to be reconsyled would ye than that
I goo and meke me and obey me unto hem and cry hem mercy Forsothe that were
not my worship. For right as men sayn ouergrete humblenes engendryth great
dispreysyng so should it fare by me in doing this great humylite or mekenes.
Than began prudence to make semblan^t of wrath and said sire save your grace /
I love your honor and your prouffight as I do mine owen and ever have do /
neither ye ne none other saw never the contrary / And yet if I had said that
ye should have purchaced your pees and the reconsilyation I ne had mykyll
myskaped ne said amys. For the wise man says / the dissension begins by
another man / And the reconsilyng be him self begins / And the prophet
says Fle shrewdnes and do goodness seek pees and follow hit in as mikyl as in
the is Yet say I not that ye shall rather pursiewe to your adversaries for pees
/ than they shall to you. For I know well enough that ye be so hard of heart
that ye will do no thing for me. And Salamon says that he that has over hard
an heart he at least shall mishappe and mistyde. When Mellebe had herd dame
prudence make semblan^t of wrath he said in this wise / Dame I pray you that ye
be not displesid of things that I say. For ye know well that I am ang^y and
wroth and that is no wonder. And they that been wroth wot not well what they
done ne what they sayn^. Wherefore the prophet says that trobled eyes have no
cl^er sight / but say ye and counceylle me as you good likes For I am ready to
do right as ye will desire. And if ye will repreue me of my folly I am the
more holden to love you and to preyse you. For salamon says / He that
repreueth him that does folly he shall find gretter grace than he that
disseyueth him with sweet words. Than said dame prudence I make no semblant of
wrath ne of anger but for your prouffit. For Salamon says He is more wroth
that repreuyth or chyd^h a fool for his folly showing him semblant of wrath
than he that supporteth him and preyseth him in his mysdoyng and lawith at his
folly. And this same Salamon says afterward that by the soroufull visage of a
man that is to say by the sorry and the heu^ ^^ntenance of a man the fool
corecteth him self and amende^h Than said Mellebee I shall not con^ answer you
unto so many fair resons as ye have put to me and showed. Say ye shortly your
will and your counceyll and I am ready to perform and fulfylle it. Than dame
Prudence discouerid all her will unto him and said / I counceylle you above
all thing that ye make pees between god and you / and be ye reconsiled unto
him and to his grace / For as I have said before God have suffrid you to have
all this tribulation and disese for your sins And if ye do as ye say you /
god will send your adversaries unto you and make hem fall at your feet / ready
to do your will and your ^ommandementes. For Salamon says / when the condition
of a man is plesaunt and lykyng to god / he changes the hertes of the mannys
adversaries and constreyneth hem to beseke him of pees and of grace And I pray
you let me speak with your adversaries pryuely. For they shall not know that
it be your will or your assente and than when I know her will and her entente
I may counceylle you the more sewrly. Dame said Mellebe do your will and your
likyng for I put me only in your disposition and ordenance.

THan when dame prudence saw the good will of her husbonde delyberyd and took
aduys in her self / thinkyng how she might bring this need to a good
conclusion and to a good end. And when she saw her time she sent for these
adversaries to come to her in to a preuy place / and shewde wisely unto hem the
great goodness that come of pees and the great harms and pareyllys that been in
war and said to hem in a goodly manner / how that they oughten to have great
repentan^ce of the Iniurye and wrong that they had don to Mellebe her lord unto
her and her daughter.

And when they herd the words of dame prudence they were so enspired and
rauysshed and had so great joy of her that wonder was to tell / A lady said
they ye have shewid unto us the blessyng of swetenes after the saw of david
the prophet for the reconsilyng / which that we be not worthy to have in no
manner / but we oughten to require it with great contrition and humylite / that
ye of your great goodness have presented unto us / Now se we well that the
science and the connyng of Salamon is (...) true he says that sweet words
multiplye and encrecen friends and make shrewes to be debonayr and meke /
Certes said they we put all our ded^ and al our matter and cause / hoolly in
your good will. And be ready to obey to the commandment of my lord Mellebe And
dear and benign lady we pray you and beseech you as mekely as we can that it
like unto your great goodness to fulfillen in deed your words goodly For we
consideren and knowleche that we have offended and greuyd my lord Mellebe out
of mesure so ferforth that we be not of power to make him amends And therefore
we obligen us and bind us and our friends for to done al his will and
co^mandementes / But perauenture ^e has such anger and such wrath to us ward
be cause of our offense / that he wole enione us such pain that we may not
bear hit ne sustain hit / And therefore noble lady we beseech your noble pite
to take such auisement in this need that we ne our friends be not disherited
and destroyed through our folly.

CErtes said dame prudence it is an hard thing and right peryllous that a man
put him self al v^terly in arbitration and Judgment and in the might and power
of his enemy. For Salamon says Believe me and give credence to that I shall
say / ne give never the power ne governance of thy goods. to thy sone. to thy
wife. to thy friend ne to thy brother / ne give thou might ne maistrye over thy
body whilst thou lyuest / Now since that he defends that a man shoold not
give to his brother ne to his friend the might of his body by a strenger reson^
he defends a man to give him to his enemy. And natheles I c^^^ceyll you that
ye my^trust not my lord. For I wot well and know verily that he is debonayr.
meke. large and curteys and no thing desirous ne covetous of good ne riches.
For there nys no thing in this world that he desires more than worship and
honor. Furthermore I know and am full ^ure that he shall no thing do in this
deed with out my counceyll. And I shall so work in this caas that by the grace
of our lord god ye shall be reconsiled unto us / Than said they with one voys /
worshipful lady we put us and our goods in your will and disposition al fully
And be ready for to come what day that it like to your noblesse to assign us
for to make our obligations and bonds also s^ronge as it shall like unto your
goodness that we mow fulfylle the will of you and my lord Mellebe. When dame
prudence had herd thanswers of these men / She bad hem return again pryuely.
And she returned again to her lord Mellebe and told him how she fond his
adversaries full repentant / Knowlechyng full lowly her sins and trespaas. And
how that they were ready to suffer al pain requyring him of mercy and pity /
Than said Mellebe he is well worthy to have pardon^ and soryeuenes that excuses
him not of his sin But knowlecheth and repents him axyng indulgence for his
sin. Seneke says / There is the remission and ^oryeuenes / For the confession
is neighbor to Innocence / And therefore I assente and conform^ me to have pees
/ but it is good that we do not without^ the will of our friends.

THan was prudence right glad ^^d ^^yefull and said certes syr^ ye have well and
goodly answered For right as by the counceyll assente and help of your friends
ye have styred to do venge you and make war. right so with outen her
counceyll shall ye not accord you ne have pees with your adversaries / For the
law says There is no thing so good be wey of kind as a thing to be unbound
be him that it was bound / And than dame prudence without delay or taryeng
sent anon^ her messagers for her kyn^ and her old friends which were true
and wise / And told hem be order in presen^e of Mellebe all this matter as is
above expressid and declared. And prayed hem that they would say her advise. and
counceylle what were best to do in this need. And when Mellebees friends had
herd this need and taken her advise and deliberation of the forsaid matter and
had examyned by great besynes and great counceyll / they yaf full counceyll for
to have pees and rest / And that Mellebe should receive with good heart his
adversaries to foryeuenes and mercy. And when dame prudence had herd thassent
of her lord Mellebe and of his friends she was wonderly glad in her heart and
said There is a noble proverb that says / the goodness that thou may do this
day do hit / and abide not ne delay it not til to morrow And therefore I
counceyll that ye send your messagers such as be discrete and wise unto your
adversaries Tellyng hem on your behalf that if they will trete of pees and of
accord / that they shape hem without delay or taryeng to come unto us /
which thing performed was in ^^de And when these trespassours and repentyng
folk of her folies that is to say the adversaries of Mellebe / had herd what
these messagers said unto hem / they were right glad and ioyeful / and answered
full mekely and benignely yeldyng graces and thankynges to her lord Mellebe and
to all his company. And shopen hem without any delay to go with the
messagers and to obey to the com^andement of her lord Mellebe. And right anon
they took her way to her lord Mellebe / And right anon they took her way to
her lords court and took with hem some of her true friends to make feyth for
hem and for to be her b^rowes. And when they were comen to the presence of
Mellebe he said to hem thise words / hit stondeth thus said Mellebe and soth
it is that causeles and withouten skyll and reason ye have don great Iniuryes to
me to my wif prudence and to my daughter also. For ye have entryd in to my house
by violence and have done such oultrage that all men know well that ye have
deseruyd death And therefore would I know of you whether ye will put you to
punysshyng And the chastysing and the vengean^ce of this oultrage in the will
of me and of my wif or ellis not.

THan the wisest of hem three answered for hem all and said Sir said he we know
well that we^be unworthy to come to the court of so great a lord and so worthy
as ye be / For we have so greatly mystaken us and have offended and gylted in
such wise against your hye lordship that trewly we have deseruyd the death /
but yet for the great goodness and debonairte that all the world witnessheth of
your person / we submit us to the excellence and benignite of your graacious
lordship / and beseching you of your merciable pite ye will co^sidere our great
repentan^ce and low submission / and gran^te us foryeuenes of of our
oultrageous trespaas and offensi^ ^ For well we known that your liberal grace
and mercy stre^^hen ferther in to goodness / than don our oultrageous gyltes
and trespaces in to wickedness / Al be hit that cursedly and dampnably we have
agilted and agreuyd your hye lordship.

THan Mellebe took hem from the ground full benyngly and received her
obligations and bonds by her oaths upon her pleges and borowes And assigned
hem a certain day to return unto his court for to receive and accept the
Judgment that Mellebe would co^mande to be done on hem by the causes aforsaid /
which things ordained every man returned to his owen house. And when dame
prudence saw her time / she feyned and axed her lord Mellebe / what vengeance
he thought to take upon his adversaries / To whi^^e Mellebe answerde and said
Certes I think and purpose me fully to disheryte hem of all that ever they
have and put hem in exile for evermore. Certes said dame Prudence / th^^ were a
cruel sentence and much against reason. For ye be rich ynowh and have none
need of other men's goode^. And ye might full lightly in this wise get you a
full covetous name / which is a vicyous living and ought to be eschewyd of
every good man. For after the word of thapostle / Couetyse is the rote of all
harms And therefore hit were better to you to lose so much good of your owen.
than for to take of her good in this manner / For better it is to lose good
with worship / that it is to win good with vilonye and shame / And every man
ought to do his diligence and besynes to get him a good name And yet shall he
not holy besye him in keeping of his good name And yet shall he not holy besye
him in keeping of his good name / but he shall allewey enforcen to do sum^e thing
by which he may renouele or renew his good name For it is wreton that the
old good loos of a man or good name is sone goon and passid when it is not
newed ne renouelyd / And as towching that ye sayn / ye wole exyle your
adversaries / that thinks me much again reason and out of mesure /
consyderyng the power that they have give you upon hem self. And yet it is
wreton that he is worthy to lose his pryuylege that mysuseth the might and the
power that is give him And I set caas that ye might enjoin hem that pain be
right and be law / which that I trow ye may not do / I say ye might not
put hit to execution. For parauenture than were it like to return to the war
as hit was before / And therefore if ye will that men do you obeyssaunce ye
must demene you more curtoysly / this it to say ye must give more esy
penance and Judgment / For it is wreton that he that most curteysly comandeth
/ to him men most obey. And therefore I pray you that in this necessyte and in
this need ye cast you for to overcome your heart. For Seneke says / He that
ouercometh his heart / ouercometh twyes / And Tullius says / There is no thing
so comendable in a great lord as when he is debonayr and meke / and appeesith
him lightly / And I pray you that ye will now forbere to do vengeance in such a
manner that your good name may be kept and conseruyd. And that men may have
cause and matter to preyse you of pity and of mercy / And that ye have no cause
to repent you of thing that is done. For Seneke says He ouercometh an evil
manner that repents him of his victory / Wherefore I pray you let mercy be
in your heart / to theffect and to thentente that god almighty have mercy on
you in his last Judgment. For saint James says in his epistlis / Judgment
without mercy shall be do to him that has no mercy on an other wight.

When Mellebe had herd the great skylles and resons of dame Prudence and her
wise Informations and techinges his heart began tenclyne to the will of his wife
Considering her great entente conformed him anon^ and assented to work after
her counceyll / And thanked god of whom proceeds all goodness and virtue /
that him has sent a wife of so great discrescion. And when the day came that
his adversaries should appear in his presence He spack to hem full goodly and
said in this wise / Al be hit so that of your pride and presumption and hie
folly of your negligence and uncunning ye have mysborn^ you and trespassyd unto
me / yet for as mykyll as I se your great humy^^te and that ye be sorry and
repentaunte of your gyltes hi^ constreyneth me to do you grace and mercy /
Wherefore I resseyue you to my grace and foryeue you vterly all the offenses
Iniuryes and wrongs that ye have don against me to this effect and to this
end that god of his endeles mercy will at the day of my dyynge forgive me my
gyltes / that I have trespassed to him in this world / For doubteles if we be
sorry and repentau^t for our sins and gyltes ^ the sight of our lord god is so
fre and so mercyable that he will forgieue us our gyltes and bring us to the
bliss that never shall have end amen.

Here Ends Chawcers tale of Mellebe and Prudence his wif and sophie his
daughter. And begynnyth the Monkis Prolog.
WHenne endid was the tale of Mellebe
And of Prudence and of her benignite
Our ost said as I am feythful man^
And be the precious corpus madryan^
I had leuyr thanne a barel of ale
That good leef my wif had herd this tale
For she is no thing of such patience
As was this Mellebees wif Prudence
Be goddis bonys when I beat my knauys
She bringith me the great clobbid stauys
And cries sle the doggis euerichon^
And break both bak and also boon^
And if that any neighbor of mine
Wol not in church to my wif enclyn^
Or be so hardy to her trespass
When she comyth hom she rampith in my face
And eryeth falls coward wreke thy wif
Be corpus dn^s I will have thy knyf
And thou shall have my distaf and go spynne
Fro day to night she wol thus begin
Allas she says that euyr I was shape
To wedde a mylksop a coward ape
That wol be ouerled with every wight
Thou dare not stand be thy wife a right
This is my liff. but if that I would fight
And out at door. anon I moot me dight
And ellis I am lost. but if that I
Be lik a wild lioun fool hardy
I woot well she will do me sle some d^y
Some neighbor and thanne go myway
For I am parlous with knyf in hond
Al be it that I. dar not her withstonde
For she is big in armies be my feith
That shall he find that here mysdoth or says
But let us pass awey from this matere
My lord sire Monk he says be merry of chere
For ye shul tellyn atale trewly
Lo rouchestr stondith here fast by
Ride forth mine owen lord break not our game
But be my truth I know not your name
Whethir shall I call you my lord dan John
Or dan Thomas dan robert or dan al^on^
Or of what house be ye be your fadir kyn^
I vow to god thou have a full fair chyn^
It is a gentil pasture there thou ghost
Thou art not lik a penaunte ghost
Up on my feith thou art some officere
Some worthy sexten or some celerer
For be my fadir foul as to my dome
Thou art a maistir when thou art at hoom^
No pour cloisterer ne no poer nouice
But a governor wily and wise
And therewith of brawn and of bonys
A well faring person for the nonys
I prey to god give him confusion^
That first the brought in to religion^
Thou woldist have be a tredefoule a right
Haddist thou as greet leave as thou have might
To perform al thy lust in gendrure
Thou haddist begotyn^ many acreature
Allas why werist thou so wide a cope
God give me sorou and I were pope
Not only thou but every mighty man^
Though he were shore up on his pan
Should have a wif for all this world is lorn^
Religioun has take up all the corn^
Of tredynge and borel men be shrympis
Of febil treys there comyth wrecchid ympis
This makith that our heiris be so sklendir
And fe^il that they may not well engendre
This makith that our wyuys wol assay
Religious folk for they may better pay
Of venus paiementis than mow we
Good woot no lussheburghs pay ze
But be not wroth my lord though I pley
Full often in game a soth have y herd say
This worthy monk took al in patience
And said I wol do my diligence
As fer as sowneth in to honest
To tell you a tale or two or three
And if you list to harkyn hidi^ward
I wol you sayn^. of the lif of saint Edward
Or ellis tragedyes first wol I tell
Of which I have an hundrid in my selle
Tregedy is forto tell a certain story
As old bokis makyn memory
Of hem that stondyn^ in greet prosperity
And is fall out of his degree
In to mysery and endith wrecchidly
And they been vercifyed comynly
Of.vj. feet which men clepyn exametron^
In prose eke ven enditid many ou
And in meter many a sundry wise
Lo this ought enough to suffice
Now harkenyth if you list for to here
But first I beseech you in this matere
Though I be order tell not thise thingis
Be it of popis Emperors and kyngis
And aftir her agis as men written find
But tell hem some before and some behind
As it comyth to my remembrance
Have me excusid of mine ignorance
.Here endith the Monkis prolog..Here begins the Tale.
I Will be wail in manner of tregedie

Many a man overthrown has she

Now art thou sathanas that may not twynne
Out of misery which thou art fall

Til she his counsel knew and she untrue
Unto his foos his counsel began bewrey
And him forsook and took another new
An hundrid foxis took Sampson for Ire
And al her tailis he to gedir bond
And set the foxis tailis al on fire
For he in every tail. has put a brond
And they brent all the corns in that land
And her olyues and her vynes eek

And had no wepyn^ with him but an ass cheek

In which his glory and his delit he had
The fairest childryn of the blood ryal
Of Jerusalem he deed to gelde anon
And made each of hem to be his thral
Among all other daniel was one
That was the wisest child of euerychone
For he the dremys of the king expowned
There as in Caldey clerkys was there none
That wiste to what fyn^ his dremys sowned
This proud king let make a statu of gold
Sixti cubitis long and seuyn in bread
To which image. both young and old
Commaundid he to loute and have in dread
Or in a furneys. full of flames read
He should be ded that would not obey
But never would acorde to that deed
Daniel ne his young fellows tweye
This king of kyngis proud and elate
He wend god that sittith in mageste
Ne might not bereue his astate
But suddenly he lost his dignite
And lik abest him semyd forto be
And cet hey as an ox and lay there out
In rayn with wild bestis walkid he
Till a certain time was come about
And lik an eglis fetheris were his heris
And nayli^ lik birds clawis were
God releuyd him at certain yeris
And yaf him wit and than with many a teer

And er that he laid was on his beer
H^ knew that god was full of might and grace
HIs sone which that highte Balttasar
That held the regne aftir his fadir day
He ly his fader could not bewaar
For proud he was of heart and of array
And eke an ydolastir was he ay
His high astat assuryd him in pride
But fortune cast him down and there he lay
And suddenly his regne began divide
A feste he made unto his lordis all
Up on a time he made hem blithe be
And thanne his officers began he call
G^th bring forth the vesselis quod he
Which that my fadir in his prosperity
Out of the tempyl of Iherusalem beraft
And to our goddis thank we
Of honor that our eldrys with us laft
His wif his lordis and his concubynys
Ay dronkyn whilis her appetitis last
Out of these nobil vesselis sundry wynes
And on a wall this king his yen cast
And saw an hond armeles that wroot fast
For feer of which he quok and sighed sore
This hond that Baltasar made so sore aghast
Wroot Mane. techel. phares and no more
In all that land magicien was there non^
That could expowne what this letter meant
But daniel expowned it anon^
And said king. god to thy fadir s^nt
Glory and honor regne tresour and rent
And he was proud and no thing god he dred
And therefore great wrath god up on him sent
An him berafte the regne that he had
He was out cast of mannys company
With assis was his habitation
And cet hey as a best in weet and dry
Til that he knew be grace and be reson^
That god of heuyn has domination
Over every regne and every creature
And thanne had god of him compassion^
And him restoryd his regne and his figure
Eke thou that art his sone art proud also
And know all these thyngis pryuyly
And art rebel to god and his foo
Thou drank eek of his vessels boldly
Thy wif eek and thy wenchis synfully
Dronk of the fame vesselis sundry wynys
And heryed falls goddis cursidly
Therefore to the shapyn greet pain is
This hond was sent from god that on the wall
Wroot mane techel Phares trust me
Thy regne is doon^. thou weyyst not al
Divided is thy regne and hit shall be
To medes and to perciens quod ^e
And that same night the king was slawe
And Darius occupied his degree
Though he thereto had neythir right ne law
Lordingis her by ensaumpil mow ye take
How that in lordship is no sikyrnesse
For whenne that fortune will a man forsake
He berith awey his regne and his riches
And eke his frendis both more and les
And what man has frendis thorough fortune
Mys hap wol make him enemies I guess
This Prou^rbe is full soth and full com^une
CEnobia of Belmarie queen
As writith Perceus of her nobles
So worthy was in armies and so kene
That no wight passid her in hardynes
Ne in lynage ne in non other gentilnes
Of kyngis blood of Perce is she descendid
I say that she had not most fiersnes
But of her shappe she might not be amendid
From her childhoode I find that she fled
Office of womman and to wode she went
And many awilde hertis blood she shed
With arowis brood that she to hem sent
She was so swist that she anon hem hent
And when that she was elder she would kylle
Liouns liberdis and hem alto rent
And in her armies welde hem at her will
She durst wild bestis dennys seek
And run in the mounteyn^ all the night
And sleep under abussh and she could eke
Wrastil be verry force and verry might
With any young man were he never so wight
There might nothing in her armies stand
She kept her maydenhede from every wight
To noman deyned she to be bond
But at last her frendis have her married
To Onedak a prince of a Cite
Al were it so. that she hem long tarried
And ye shul understand how that he
Had such fantesies as had she
But natheles when they were knet in ^ere
They lyuyd in joy and infelicite
For each of them had other leef and dear
Save o thing that she nolde never assent
Be no wey that he should be her ly
But onys for it was her pleyn intent
To have a child the world to multiplye
And also sone as she might aspye
That she was not with child with that deed
Thanne would she suffir him do his fantesie
Est sonys and not but onys out of dread
And if she were with child at that cast
No More should he pleye that game
Til fully.xl. days were y past
Then would she onys suffir him the same
Al were this Onedak wild or tame
He gat no more of here for thus she said
It was to wyuys lechery and shame
In other caas if men with hem playde
Two sonys be this Onedak had she
The which she kept in virtue and lettrure
But now unto our tale turn we
I say that worshipful creature
And wise therewith and large with mesure
So penibil in war and curteys eke
Ne nomre labor might in werre endure
Was non. though all this world men should seche
Her rich array might not be told
As w^l in vessel as in clothinge
She was al glad in Perry and in gold
And eke she left not for non hunting
To have of sundry tongis folk knowing
Whenne that she leyser had and forto enten^e
To learn bokis was al her likyng
H^w she in virtue her lif might dispende
And shortly of this story forto trete
So doughty was her husbond as she
That they conqueryd many regnes great
In the oryent with many a feyr cite
Appertenaunt unto the majesty
Of rome and with strenghte held hem fast
Ne never might her fomen do her flee
All the whilez that Onedakis days last
Her batellis who so list hem forto read
Again Sapor the king and other mo
And how all this process fill in deed
Why she conqueryd and what title she had thereto
And aftir of her myshief and her woo
How that she was besegid and I take
Lat him to my maistyr Petrark go
That writtih ynow of this I undertake
Whenne Onedack was ded she myghtily
The remys held and with her owen hond
Agayns her foos she faught trewly
That there nas prince ne king in all that land
But were glad if they that grace fond
That she ne should up on his land werreye
With her they made aliaunce be bond
To be in pees and let hem ride and pl^ye
The Emperor of rome Claudius
Ne him beforn^ the romayn Galiene
Ne durst never be so corageous
Ne non ermyn ne none egipcien
Ne furrien ne non arabien
With ynne the field that durst with her fight
Lest that she would hem with her hondis sleen^
Or with her meyne put hem to flight
In kyngis habit went her sonys two
As heyris of here remys all
And hermanno and titamallo
Her namys were as perciens hem call
But ay fortune has in her honey galle
This mighty queen may no while endure
Fortune made her out of her regne fall
To wrecchidnesse and to mysauenture
Aurilian whenne that he the governance
Of rome came in his hondis tweye
He shoop up on this queen to do vengeance
And with his legions he took his wey
Toward Cenobie and shortly forto seye
He made her fle and at last her hent
And fetherid her and eke her childryn tweye
And wan the land and hom to rome he went
Among other thing that he wan
Her chare that of gold was wrought and perre
This great romayn this aurilian^
Has with him lad that for men should se
Beforn^ his triumph walkid she
With goldyn cheynes on her neck hanginge
Crowned she was as aftir her degree
And full of Perre chargid her clothinge
Allas fortune she that whilom was
Dredful to kyngis and to Emperouris
Now gawrith all the pepil on her allas
And she that helmyd was in sta^k shouris
And wan beforce towns strong and touris
Shall on her head now were auetremyte
And she that bare the septre full of flouris
Shall bear a distaf her cost forto quyte
OF Melan great Barnabo viscounte
God of delight and scorge of lumbardye
Why should not I thy fortune acounte
Sithen in estat thou clombyn were so hye
Thy brothir sone that was thy dowbyl alye
For he thy neuewe was and sone in law
With ynne his prison made the to dye
But why ne how woot I that thou were slawe
OF the earl Engelyn^ of ^ise the langour
There may no tunge tell for pite
But litil out of pise stondith a tour
In which tour in prison put was he
And with him his lityl children three
The eldist skarsly.v. year was of age
Allas fortune it was great cruelte
Such briddis forto put in such a cage
Dampened he was to death in that prison^
For roger which Bishop was of pyse
Had on him maad a falls ^uggestion^
Through which the pepil began on him arise
And put him in prison in such a wise
As ye have herd and mete and drynk he had
And therewith all it was full poor and badde
And on aday it be fill that in that hour
When that his mete was wont to be brought
The gailer shitte the doris of the tour
He herd it well but he saw it naught
And in his heart there fill a thought
That they for hunger would do him to dien^
Allas quod he allas that I was wrought
Therewith the teris fille from his yen^
His young sone that three year was of age
Unto his fader he said why do ye weep
Whenne wol our Gayler bring our potage
Is there no morsel ^reed that the do sleep
I am so hungry that I may not sleep
Now would god that I might sleep euyr
Thanne should no hunger in my womb crepe
There is no thing than bred that me were leuyr
Thus day be day this child began to cry
Til in his fadris barm adoun it lay
And said far well fader I mot dye
For this pain no longer suffer I may
And whenne the woeful fader ded him say
For woe his armies he began to byte
And said allas fortune and welawey
Thy falls whele my woe I may wit
His other child wend that for hunger it was
That he his armies gnew and not for woo
And said fader do not so allas
But rathir oet the flessh up on us two
Our ^^essh thou yaf us take our flessh us fro
And ete enough right thus the child said
And aftir that with ynne aday or two
The child leyde him down in his lap and deyde
Him self dispeiryd eek for hunger starf
Thus endid the mighty earl of pyse
from high estate fortune from him carf
Of this tragedye it ought I nough suffyse
Who so will here it in a lengir wise
Redith the great poet of ytaile
That hight daunte for he can it deuyse
Fro point to point not o word will he fail
AL though that Nero were as vicyous
As any fend that lith full low adoun
Ye he as tellith us Snetomus
All this world had in subiection^
Both est and west and septemtrion^
Of rubies. saphires and of perlis white
Were all his clothis browdid up and down
For he in gemmys greatly began delight
More delicat. more pompons of array
More proud was never Emperor than he
That ilke cloth that he had weryd o day
After that time he nolde it never se
Nettis of goold thread had he great plente
To fisshe in tiber whenne he list to pleye
His lustis were as law in his degree
For fortune as his friend would him obey
He rome brent for his dilycacye
The senators he slough up on aday
To here how that wommen would weep and cry
And slough his brothir and by his ^uster lay
His mother made he in a pytous array
For he her womb slytte to be hold
Where he conceived was so well away
That he so lityl of his modir told
No teris out of his eyes for that sight
Ne came but said a fair womman was she
Great wondir is that he could or might
Be domesman of her ded beauty
The wyn to bring com^aundid he
And drank anon^ non other woe he made
Whenne might is joined unto cruelte
Allas to deep wol the venym wade
In yonthe a maistir had this Emperor
To teache him le^trure and curtesye
For of moralite he was the flour
And in his time but if his bokis lie
And whilis his master had of him maistrie
He made him so konnynge and so souple
That long time it was or tirannye
Or any vice durst in him uncouple
Seneca his maistir was of which I deuyse
Be cause Nero had of him such dread
For (...) for his vicis would him chastise
Discretly as by word and not be deed
Sire he would say an Emperor moot need
Be virtuous and hate Tyranny
For which he made him in a bath to blede
On both his armies til he must dye
This Nero had eek of a custumaunce
In yongthe ayens his maistir to rise
which aftirward him thought a great greuan^ce
Be cause be often would him chastyse
Therefore he made him dye in this wise
To chese in abath to dye in this manner
Rathir thanne to have another turmentyse
And thus has Nero slain his maistir dear
Now fyl it so that fortune list no longer
The high pride of Nero to cherisshe
For though he were strong yet was she strenger
She thought thus be god I am to nyce
To set a man that is fulfillid of vice
In his degree and an Emperor him call
Be god out of his sete I wol him tri^e
When he lest wenyth sonnest shall he fall
The pepil roos upon him on an night
For his defaute and when he it aspyed
Out of his doris anon he has him dight
Alone and there he wend have be alyed
He knockid fast and ay the more he cried
The fastir sh^t they the dorys all
Tho wiste he well he had him self begilyd
And went his way no lengir durst he call
The pepil cryde and romblid up and down
That with his eris he herd how that they said
Where is this false treiteur this neron
For feer full near out of his wit he breyde
And to his goddis pitously he seyde
For socour but it might not be tide
For dread of this him thought that he deyde
An ran in to a gardyn him to hyde
And in this gardyn fond he chorlis tweye
And sittyng be. a. fire great and reed
And to the chorlis two he began to preye
To sle him and to girde of his head
That to his body when he were ded
Weere no despyt doon^ for his defame
Him self he slough he could no bettir re^e
Of which fortune lowhe and had game
WAs neuyr Capteyn under a king
That regnes mo put in subiection^
Ne strenger was in feld of all thing
As in his time ne gretter of renoun
Ne more Pompous in high presumpcion^
Than Olophern^ which fortune at last
So licorously ladde him up and down
Til that ^e ded was or that he wiste
Not only that this world had of him awe
For lesing of riches and liberte
But he made every man reneye his law
Nabugodonosor was lord said he
N^ne other god should honored be
Ayens his heste there dar no wight trespass
Sane in Betulia a strong cite
W^^re Eliachim was pressed of that place
But take keep of the death of Olophern^
Amyd his ost he drunk lay al night
With ynne his tente large as is a bern^
And yet for all his pomp and al his might
Judith a womman as he lay upright
Slepinge his head of smoot and fro his tente
Full pryuely she stale from every wight
And to the cite she has it sent
WHat nedith it of king Antiochus
To tell his high and ryal majesty
His high pride his werk venemus
For such another man nas neuyr as he
Redith what that he was in Macha^e
And redith the proud workis that he leyde
And why he fill from his prosperity
And in an hill how wrecchidly he deyde
Fortune him had enhaunsid so in pride
That verily he wend he might atteyne
Unto the sterris up on every side
And in a balaunce to weye each mounteyn^
And all the flodis of the se restreyn
And goddis people had he most in hate
Hem would he sle in tourment and in peyn^
Wenynge that god ne might his pride abate
And for Nichamore and Timothe
Wiche Jews were vencusid myghtily
Unto the Jews such an hate had he
That he had gretthid his chare full hastily
And swoor and said full despitously
Unto Jerusalem. he would eftsone
To wreke his Ire on it full cruelly
But of his purpoos was he let full sone
God for his manace him sore smoot
With inuisibil wound ay nicurabyl
That in his guts carf so and boot
That his peynys were Importable
And certainly the wreche was vnresonabil
For many amannys guttis did he pain
But from his purpoos cursid and dampnabil
For all his smert. he nolde him restreyne
But bad anon pareylen his oost
And suddenly or he than was waar
God dauntyd all his pride and al his bost
For he so sore fill out of his chare
That all his lymys and his skyn to tare
So that he ne might go ne ride
But in a chayer men about him baar
Al for brosid both bak and side
The wreche of god him smot so cruelly
That in his body wicked wormys crept
And therewith al he stank so horribly
That none of all his meyne that him kept
Whethir that he wook or ellis slepte
Ne might not of him the stynk endure
And in this myschief he wayled and eke wept
And knew god lord of every creature
To al his ost and to him self also
Full waltsom was the stynk of his ca^eyn
No man might him ^ere to ne fro
And in his stynk and in his horrible peyn^
He start full wre^chidly on a mountayn^
Thus has this robber and this homicide
That many a man made to weep and plain
Such guerdon as belongith unto pride
THe story of alisaun^ir is so com^une
That every wight that has discrecion
Has herd sumwhat or al of his fortune
This wide worl^e as in conclusion^
He wan / be strength and his renoun
They were glad for pees unto him send
The pride of man and ^oste he leyd a down
Where so he came in to the worldis end
Comparison might yet never be makid
Betwix him and another conqueror
For all this world for dread of him has quakid
He was of knyghthod and of fredom flour
Fortune him made the heir of high honor
Save wyn and wommen no thing might a swage
His high intent in arms and labor
So was he ^ul of loving courage
What pite were it to him though I you told
Of darius and of a hundrid thousand mo
Of princis. erlis. and kyngis. bold
Which he conqueryd and brought to woo
I say as fer as aman may ride or go
The world was his. what should I more deuyse
For though I wrrote or told you euyr mo
Of his knyghthood it might not suf^yse
Xij. year he reigned as I read in Machab^
Philippis sone of Macedo he was
That first was king of greece that country
O worthy gentyl A^saunder allas
That euyr should fall such acas
Empoysond of thy folk thou were
Thy strong fortune has tournyd in to an aas
And for the ne wept she never ateer
Who shall give men terys to complain
To the of gentilnesse and of franch^^^
That all the world weldid in his demeyne
And yet him thought it might not suffyse
So full was his courage of high emprise
Allas who shall me help to endite
Falls fortune and poison to despise
The which of all this woo I wite
GE wisdom manhood and high labor
From humbilheed and fro ryal majesty
Up roos he Julius the conqueror
That all the occident be land and see
Be strength of hond or elli^ be ^^^te
And unto rome made hem t^^butary
And since of rome Emperor was he
Till that fortune wey (...) adversary
O mighty Caesar th^^ (...) Thessaly

Thank fortun^ that so well the spedde
But now a litil while I will bewayl
This Pompeius this nobil governor
Of rome which that fley at this bataille
I say on of his men a falls traitor
His head of smoot to win him favor
Of Julius and to him the head brought
Allas Pompeye of the oryent conqueror
That fo^tune unto such a fyn the brought
To rome again repeyrith Julius
With his triumph laureat full hye
But on a time Brutus Cassius
That euiyr had of his high astat envy
Full pryuily had maad conspirefye
Ayens this Julius in subtle wise
And cast the place in which he should dye
With boydekyns as I shall you deuyse
This Julius unto the Capitoly went
Up on ady as he was wont to gon^
And in the Capitoly anon^ him hent
This false Brutus on of his foul foon^
And stikyd him with boydekyns anon^
with many a woun^^ and thus they leet himlye
But never gruntyd he at no struck but oon^
Or ellis at his woe but if his story lie
So manly was this Julius of heart
And so well louyd estatly ^on^ste
That thought his dedly woundis so so^^ smert
His mantel over his hippis cast he
For noman should se his priuyte
And as he lay in dy^nge on a tra^^c^
And wiste verily that dye should he
Of honest hit had he remembrance
Lucan unto this story I recom^ende
And to Sneton^ and to valery also
That of this story written word and end
How that these conquerours two
Fortune was first friend and sithen foo
Noman trust up on his favor long
But have here in a wait for euermo
Witness on all the conquerours strong
THe rich Cresus whilom king of lyde
Of which Cresus Citrins sore him drad
Yet was he canght amyd al his peyde
And to brenne men to the fire him had
But such arayn^ down fro the firmament shadde
That queynte the fire and made him to escape
But to be waar yet no grace he had
Till fortune on the galowis made him gape
Whenne he ascaped was he could not stynte
Forto begin a new array agayn^
He wend well for that fortune him sent
Such that he a scapid through the rayn^
That of his foos he might not be slayn^
And such a sweuyn up on a night he met
Of which he was so proud and eke so feyn^
That in vengeance he all his heart set
Upon a tree he was as him thought
Th^re Jupiter him wessh both hals and side
And Phoebus eek a fair towail him brought
To dry him with and therewith wext his pride
And to his daughter that stood him beside
Which that he knew in high sentence habounde
He ^ad her tell what it signified
And she his dremys right thus expouned
The tree quod she the galowis is to mean
And Jupiter betokenyth snow and rayn^
And Phoebus with his towel so clean
Be tokeneth the son bemys soth to sayn^
Thou shall an hangid be fadir certeyn^
Rayn shall the wasshe and son shall the dry
Thus she warned full plat and full pleyn^
His daughter that called was Phanye
An hangid was Cresus the proud king
His ryal trone might him not auaylle
Tragedy is non other manner thing
Ne can in syngrye ne bewaylle
For that fortune alday wol assaylle
With vnwaar struck the regnes that be proud
For whenne men trust in her than wol she faylle
And cover her bright face under a cloud
Here endith the Monks tale.
HO quod our ooste sir no more of this
That ye have said is enough ywis
And mykyl more for mykyl heaviness
Is right enough to mykyl folk I ges
Your talis done us no disport ne game
Wherefore sir Monk Piers Adam be your name
I pray you hertly tell us sumwhat ellis
For sikirly nere clynkyng of your bellis
That on your brydil hongyn on every side
Be heuyn king that for us all did
I should or this fallen down for sleep
Al though the slough had neuyr be so deep
Thanne had your tale al be told in ve^^^
For certainly as these clerkis seyn^
Where as a man may have non audience
Not helpith it to tell his sentence
And well I woot the substance is in me
If any thing shall well reportyd be
Sere say sumwhat of huntyng I you pray
Nay quod this monk I have no lust to play
Now let anothir tell as I have told
Than spak our ost with mylde speech and bold
And said to the Nonnys pressed anon
Com ner thou pressed com hidir sir John
Tell us such thing as may our hertis glade
Be blithe though thou ride up on a Jade
What though thy horse be foul and lene
If he wol serve the recke the not abene
Look that thy heart be merry euyr moo
Yes sir quod he so moot y goo
But I be merry I wis I wol be blamyd
And right anon his tale he has attamyd
And thus he said to us euerichon^
This sweet priest this gostly man sir John
Here ends the prolog of the Nonnys priest And here begins his tale.
A Pour wydow some deel stepped in age
Was sometime dwelling in a cotage
Beside a grove stondyng in a dale
This whidow of which I tell my tale
Syn that day that she was last a wife
In patience led a full simpyl life
For lityl was her catel and her rent
By husbondrye such as god her sent
She fond her self and eek her doughtryn two
Three large sowys had she and nomo
Three kyne and eek a sheep that highte malle
Full soty was her bour and eek her halle
In which she eet meny a slendir meel
Of poynaunt sauce nedith her never ad^el
Ne deynte morsel passid through her throat
Her diet was accordaunt to her cote
Repleccion ne made her never syke
A temperat diet was her phisyke
And exercise and hertis suffisaunce
The gowte let her no thing forto dance
Ne replexion shente not her head
No wyn drank she white ne red
Her board was most served with whit and blak
Milk and broun bred in which she fond no lak
Salt bacon^ and sometime an ey
For she was as amaner of a dey
A yerd she had enclosid al about
With dry stickis and dichid without
In which she had a cok highte chaunte^leer
In all the land of crowyng nas his peer
His wis was merier than the merry orgon^
On mass days that in church goon^
Well sikerer was his crowyng in his loge
Thanne is a clock or in any abbey an orloge
Be nature he crewe each assencion^
Of the equynoccion in the town
For whenne degrees.xv. were ascendid
Than crew he that it might not be amendid
His comb was redder than the fyn coral
And batellid as it had be a castle wall
His bil was blak as any geet it shoon^
Lik asure were his leggis and his toon
His naylis whitter than the lily flour
And lik the burned gold was his color
This g^ntil cok had in his governance
Seven ^^nnys to do with his plesaunce
Which were his sistris and his paramouris
And wonder lik to him as of colouris
Of which the fairist he wid in the throat
Was clepid fair damysel Pertelote
Curteys she was discreet and debonaire
And compenabil and baar her self so fair
S^n that time that she was seue night old
That trewlich she has the heart in hold
Of chaunte cleris lokyng in every lith
He loves her so that well was him therewith
When the bright son began to spring
Hit was a melodye to here hem sing
In sweet accord my leef is fare in land
For that time as I have understand
Bestis and briddis could speak and sing
And so it fill that in the dawenynge
Chaunte clear among his wyuys all
Sat on his perc^e that was in the halle
And next him sat his fair Pertelote
This chaunte clear began to groan in his throat
As a man in his dreme is drecchid ^ore
And when that Pertelot thus herd him rore
She was aghast and said heart dear
What eylith you to groan in this manner
Ye be a verry sleper fie for shame
And he answerde thus Madame
I pray you that ye take it not in greef
Be god I met I was in such myschief
Right now that mine heart is sore a fright
Now god my sweuen he recche a right
And keep my body out of foul prisoun
I met that I romed up and down
With ynne our yerde where I saw a b^st
Was lyk an hounde and would have made a rest
Up on my body and would have had me ded
His color was betwixt yelow and reed
And tippyd was his tail and both his eris
With blak unlike the remenaunt of his heris
His snowte small with glowyng eyes tweye
Yet for his look almost for feer I deye
This causith me my gronyng doutles
Awey quod she fie for shame hertlees
Allas quod she for be god above
Now have ye lost mine heart and al my love
I can not love a cowarde be my feyth
For certis what so any womman seith
We all desiren^ if it might be
To have husbondis hardy wise and fre
And secret and non nygard ne no fool
Ne him that is aghast of every tool
Ne none auauntour be god above
How durst ye sey for shame unto your love
That any thing might make you a feerde
Have ye no mannys heart and have a berde
Allas and conne ye be a ferd of sweuenys
No thing but vainte god woot in sweuene is
Sweuenys engendren of replexion^
And of sin and of complexion^
When humors been to habundaunt in a wight
Certis this dreme which ye have met to night
I tell you truth ye may trust me
Comes of your superfluyte and read color parde
Which cause folk to dread in her dremys
Of ^rowes and of fire with read lemys
Of great bestes that wole hem byte
And all as a Iape not worth a myte
Right as the humor of Melancolye
Causes many a man in sleep to cry
For feer of great bolis and beris blake
Or ellis blake deuylles wol hem take
Of humors could I tell also
That worken a man in sleep mykyl woe
But I will pass as lightly as I can
Lo Caton which that was a wise man
Said he not thus^ do no fors of dremys
Now sir quod she when we fle fro the bemys
For goddis love as takith sum laxatif
Up peril of my soul and my lif
That both of coler and of malencolye
Ye purge you and for ye shul not tarry
Though in this town be non apotecary
I shall my self two herbis teache you
That shall be for your hele and for your prow
And in your yerd tho herbis shall I find
The which have of her proper kind
To purge you benethe and eke above
Foryet not this for goddis owen love
Ye be right colerik of complexion^
Where the son is in his ascension^
Ne find ye not of humors hot
For if ye do I dar ley a grote
Thanne shall ye have a feuyr terciane
Or an agew that may be your bane
A day or two ye shul have digestyuys
Of wormys or ye take your laxatiuys
Of laureal centory and of fumetory
Or ellis of the elderberyes that growyn there b^
Of Catapuce or of gaytre beryes
Of herb yue growyng in your yerd that merry is
Pluk hem up as they grow and ete hem yn^
Be merry husbond for your fadir kyn^
Dredith no dreme I can say you no more
Madame quod he gramercy of your lore
But natheles as touching Catoun
That of wisdom has such a great renoun
That he bad no dremys forto dread
Be god men may in old bokis read
Of many aman more of auctorite
Than ^^yr Caton was so moot y the
That all the reuers says of his sentence
And have well found be experience
That dremys be significaciouns
As well of joy as of tribulacions
That folk enduryn in this life present
There nedith to make of this non^ argument
The verry preef shewith it in deed
One of the grettest auctor that men read
Says thus that sumtyme two felowis went
On pilgremage in full good intent
And happid so they common in a town
Where as there was such congregation
Of pepyl and eke of streit herbegage
That they ne fond as mykyl as a cotage
In which they both might I loggid be
Wherefore they must of necessite
As for that night depart company
And each of them goth to his osterye
And took his loggyng as it would fall
That on of hem was loggid in a stalle
Far in the yerde with oxen of the plow
That other man was loggid well ynow
As was his adventure or his fortune
That us gouernyth al as in comune
And so it be fyl long or it were day
This man met in his bed there that he lay
That his fellow began to him call
And said allas for in an oxes stalle
This night shall I be murdrid there I ly
Now help me dear brother or I die
In all haste com to me he said
This man out of his sleep for feer abreyde
And when he was wakid of his sleep
He turned him and took of this no keep
Him thought his dreme was but avanyte
Thus twyse in his sleep dremyd he
And at thridde time yet his felaw
Came as him thought and said I am now slawe
Behold my blody woundis deep and wide
Arise up erly in the morrow tide
And at west gate of the town quod he
A cartful of dung there shall thou se
In which my body is hid full pryuely
Do that carte areste boldly
My gold causid my death soth to sayn^
And told him every point how he was slayn^
With a full pitous face pale of hew
And trust well his dreme he fond right true
For on the morrow as soon as it was day
To his felowis in he took the way
And whenne that he came to the oxis stalle
Aftir his fellow he began to call
The Osteler answered him anon^
And said sire your fellow is goon^
As soon as day he went out of the town
This man began fallyn in suspessioun
Remembryng of his dremys that he met
And forth he goth no lengir would he^ let
Unto the westgate of the town and fond
A dong carte as it were to donge land
That was arayd in the same wise
As ye have herd the ded man deuyse
And with hardy heart he began to cry
Vemaunce and Justice of this felonye
My f^low murdrid is this same night
And in this carte he lies gapyng up right
I (...) out on the mynistres quod he
That should keep and reu^^ this cite
Harow allas h^re lies my fellow slain
What sh^lde ^ more of this tale sayn
The pepyl out sterte and cast the carte to ground
And in the myddel of the dong they fond
The ded man that murdrid was al new
O bl^sful god that art so good and true
Lo how that thou bewreyest murdir alwey
Murdir wol out that se we day be day
Murdir is so waltsom and abhomynabyl
To god that Just is and reasonable
That he ne wol it suffer helyd to be
Though it abide aday or two or three
Murdir wol out this is my conclusion^
And right anon the mynystris of the town
Have hent the carter and so sore him pyned
And eke the Osteler so sore engyned
That they beknew her wickydnesse anon
And weren an hangid be the neck boon
Here may ye se that dremys ben to dread
And certis in the same lif I read
Right in the next chappitre aftir this
I gab not so have I joy and blis
Two men that would have passid over these
For certain causis in to a fer contre
If the wynd ne had be contrary
That made hem in a cite to tarry
That stood full merry up on an haven side
But on aday ayens an even tide
The wynd began change and blew as him list
Ioly and glad they wentyn to rest
And cast hem full erly forto saylle
But herkyn to that on man fill a greet meruaylle
The on of hem slepinge as he lay
He met a wonder dreme again the day
Him thought a man stood by his beddis side
And him com^aundid that he should abide
And said him thus if thou to morrow wend
Thou shall be dreynt my tale is at an end
He wook and told his fellow what he met
And prayde him his viage forto le^te
As for that day he prayde him forto abide
His fellow that lay be his beddis side
Began forto lawhe and scornyd him full fast
No dreme quod he may do my heart agaste
That I wol let forto so my thingis
I set not a straw for thy dremyngis
For sweu^nys be but vaintees and Iapes
Men metyn alday of owlis and of apes
And of many amase therewith al
And dremyn of thing that neuir was ne shall
But since I se that thou wolt here abide
And thus slouthen wilfully thy tide
God woot it rewith me and have good day
And thus he took his leave and went his way
But er he had half his course ysayled
I not why ne what myschaunce it aylyd
But casuelly the shippis botom to rent
And ship and man under the watir it went
In sight of other shippis beside
That with him sailed at same tide
And therefore fair Pertelot so dear
By ensamplis old may thou here
That noman should be to recheles
Of dremys for I say the dontles
That many a dreme sul sore is forto dread
Lo in the life of saint Kenelme I read
That was Kenulphus sone the nobil king
Of mereturik how kenelme met a thing
A lityl or he were mordrid on aday
His mordir in his vision he say
His norice him expouned it eueridell
His sweuyn and bad him keep him well
Fro treson but he was but.vij. year old
And therefore lityl tale he has thereof told
Of any dreme so holy was his heart
Be god I had leuyr than my sherte
That ye had herd his legend as have I
Dame Pertelot I say to you trewly
Macrobius that writtith the visioun
In his book of the dremes of scipioun
Affermyth dremys and says that they been^
Warnyng of thingis that we aftir seen^
And ferthermore I pray you lokith well
In the old testament of daniel
If he held dremys any vainte
Read eke of Joseph and there shul ye se
Wondris ben some time but I say not al
Warnyng of thingis that shul aftir fall
Lo of Egypt the king that hight Pharao
His baker and eke his boteler also
Whethir they felt non effect in dremys
Who so wol seek actis of sundry remys
May read of dremys awondir thing
Lo Cresus which was of lide king
Met he not that he sat up on a tree
Which signified he should hangid be
Lo Andrometa Hectors wif
That day that Hector should lose his lif
She dremyd in the same night beforn^
How that the lif of Hector should be lorn^
If that day he went un to bataille
She warned him but it might not auay^le
He went forto fight natheles
But he was slain anon of Achilles
But that tale is to long to tell
And ^ek it is nygh day I may not dwell
Shortly I say as for conclusion^
That I shall have of this avision^
Aduersite and I say furthermore
That I ne tell of laxatiuis no store
For they be venomous I woot it weel
I hem diffye I love hem neuyr adeel
But now let us speak of mirthe and stynt all this
Madame Pertelot so have I blis
Of o thing god has me sent large grace
For when I see the beauty of your face
Ye be so skarlet reed about your yen
It makes al my dread forto dien
For also sikir as in principio
Mulier est hommis confusio
Madame the sentence of this latin is
Womman is mannys Joy and his blis
For when I feel an night your soft side
Al be it that y may not on you ride
For that our perch is made so narow allas
I am so full of joy and of solas
That y diffye both sweuene and dreme
And with that word he fley down fro the beem
For it was day and eek his hennys all
And with a chuk he began hem down call
For he had found a corn^ lay in the yerde
Ryal he was and no more a ferde
He federyd Pertelot twenty time
And trade as often or it was pryme
He lokith as he were a grym ^^oun
And on his toos he romed up an down
Him deyned not to set his feet to ground
Ay he chuckid whenne he had a corn^ y found
And to him thanne ran his wyuys all
As ryal as a prince in his halle
Leave I this chauntcleer in his pasture
And aftir wol I tell of his adventure
When the month in the which the ^^^^de began
That highte march that god first made man
Was complet and passid were also
Since march began thritty days and two
Be^il that chauntecleer in all his pride
His seuyn wyuys walkyng him beside
Cast up his yen to the bright son
That in the sign of taurus was I run
Twenty degrees and oon^ and sumwhat more
He knew be kind and be non other ^^re
That it was pryme and crew with a blisful steuyn
The son he said is clombe up to heuyn
Forty degrees and one and sumwhat more I wys
Madame Pertelote my worldis blis
Harkyn how this blisful briddis sing
And se the fressh flouris how they spring
Full is mine heart of revel and sol^s
But suddenly him fill a sorouful caas
For ever the latter end of joy is woo
And comynly often time it f^llith so
And if a rethour could fair endite
He in a cronycle might sauely write
As for a souereyn notabilyte
Now every wyseman herkyn to me
This story is al so true I undertake
As is the book of lancelot delake
That wommen holden in full great reverence
Now wol I turn again to my sentence
A col fox full of sleyghte and iniquite
That in the grove had woned yeris three
Be high ymaginacion aforn^ cast
The same night thorough the hegge brast
Into the yerd there chauntecleer the fair
Was wont and eke his wyuys to repair
And in a bed of wortis stille he lay
T^l it was passid vndren of the day
Waytinge his time on chauntecleer to fall
As gladly done thise homicides all
That in a wait ligge to murdre men
A falls murderour ruckyng in thy den
O new Scariot and new Genylion^
Falls dissinnlour o greek Synon^
That broughtist troy vttirly to sorrow
O chauntecleer acursid be the merow
That thou in thy yerde fley fro the bemys
Thou were full well warnyd be thy dremys
That ilke day was perilous to the
But that god before woot must nedis be
Aftir the oppinion of certain clerkis
Witness of him that any clerk is
That in scole is great altercacion^
In this matter and great disputacion^
And has been of an hundrid thousand men
But I ne can not bulte out the brenne
As can the holy doctor Austyn^
Or boece or the bishop Bradwardyn^
Whethir that goddis will before wetynge
Streynyth me needles to do a thing
Nedly clepe I simpyl necessite
Or if the fre choys be grauntyd me
To do that same thing or do it naught
Though god forwoot it or it was wrought
Or if his witynge streyneth neuyr adeel
But by necessite condicionel
I wol not have to doon^ of such matere
My tale is of a cok as ye shul here
That took his counceyl of his wif with sorrow
To walk in the yerde up on the morrow
That he had met the dreme as I you told
Womennys counceyllis be full often cold
Womannys counceyl brought us first to w^^
And made adam fro paradis to go
There as he was full merry and well at ese
But for I not whom I might displese
If I counceyl of wommen would blame
Pass over I said it in my game
Redith auctours where they trete of such matere
And what they say of wommen ye mow her^
These been the cokkis wordis and not mine
I can no harm of no womman deuyne
Fair in the sonde to bathe her merrily
Lith P^rtel^t and all her susteris by
Ayens ye son and chauntecleer so free
Sang merier than the marmayde in the sea
For Phisalogus says vttirly
How that they syngen well and merrily
And so be fill as he cast his ye
Among the wortis on a boterflye
He was waar of this fox that lay full low
No thing than lust (...) forto crow
But cr^de anon cok cok and up he stert
^s man that was afraid (...) his heart
For naturelly a best desirith to fle
Fro h^s contrary if he may it se
Th^ugh he neuyr had seyn it erst with his ye
This c^auntec^^er when he began him aspye
He would have fled but that the fox anon
Said gentyl sire allas what will ye don
Be ye afraid of me that am your fr^^de
Certis sire than be ye unkind
If I to you would harm or vilonye
I am not common your counseyl to aspye
But trewly the cause of my coming
Was only to here how ye sing
For trewly ye have as merry a steuyn
As any aungel has that is in heuyn
Therewith ye have of musik more feeling
Than had voys or any that can sing
My lord your fadir god his soul blis
And eke your mother of her gentilnes
Have in my house be full well at ese
And certes sire feign would I you plese
But for men speak of syngyng I would sey
So moot I browkyn mine yen twey
Save you ne herd I never man so sing
As did your fader in the morning
Certis it was of heart all that he song
And forto make his voys the more strong
He would so pain him that with both his yen^
He must wynke so loud he must cryen^
And stondyn on his tiptoos therewith all
And strecche forth his neck long and small
And ^ek he was of such discrecion^
That there was noman in no region^
That him in song or wisdom might pass
I have well ^ed dan burnel the ass
Among his verse there was a cok
For a prestis sone yaf him a knok
Up on is leggis while he was young and ny^^
He made him forto lose his benefice
But there is no comparison^
Betwix the wisdom and discrecion
Of your fadir and of his subtilyte
Now syngith sire for saint charity
Let se can ye your fadir countirfete
This chauntecleer his wyngis began beat
As man that could not his reason aspye
So was he rauysshed with his flaterye
Allas ye lordis many a falls flaterour
Is in your court and meny a falls losingour
That plese you more be my feith
Than he that sothfastnes unto you says
Redith ecclesiast of flaterye
Bewaar ye lordis of her trecherye
This chauntecleer stood hye up on his toos
Strecching his neck and held his yen cloos
And began to crow loud for the nonys
And dan russell start up at onys
And by the gorge hente chauntecleer
And on his bak toward the wode him beer
For yet was there noman that him ^ued
O destene that may not be eschued
Allas that chauntecleer fley fro the bemys
Allas his wife raught not of dremys
And on a friday fill all this myschaunce
O venus that art god of plesaunce
Sithnes that thy seruan^t was this chauntecleer
And in thy seruise did al his power
More for delight than the world to multiplye
Why woldist thou suffer him on thy day to dye
O Gaufryde dear maistir souereyn
That when the worthy king richard was sleyn
With shot complemedist his death so sore
Why ne had I now thy sentence and thy lore
The friday forto childen as did ye
For on a friday shortly slain was he
Thanne would I show you how that I could pleyn
For chauntecleer and for his peyn^
Certis such cry ne lamentacion^
Nas of ladies maad whenne Ilion was won
And pirrus with his bright swerd
When he hent king Pryam be the berd
And slow him as says Eneydos
As maden all the hennys in the cloos
Whenne that they had of chauntecler the sight
But souerenly dame Pertelot began to shright
Full louder than did hasdrubalis wif
Whenne that her husbond had lost his lif
And that the romans had brent Cartage
She was so full of turment and of rage
That wilfully in to the fire she stert
And brende her self with a steadfast heart
O woeful hennys so that cryden ye
As whenne that Nero brent the cite
Of rome criden the Senatouris wyuys
For that her husbondis should lose her liuys
Withoutyn gilt Nero has hem sleyn^
Now wol I turn to my tale agayn^
This sely widow and her deughtris two
Herden the hennys cry and make woo
And out at the door stert they anon
And saw the fox toward the wode goon^
And baar up on his bak the cok awey
And criden out and harow and welawey
A ha the fox and aftir him they run
And eek with staves meny other men
Ran colle our dog talbot and garlonde
And malkyn with her distaf in her hand
Ran ^ow and eek the very hoggis
For they so sore a ferd were of the doggis
And showtyng of men and of wommen eek
They run so her heart thought to break
They yellyn as fendis done in hell
The doggis criden as men would hem quelle
Out of the h^uys com the swarm of bees
The gees for feer fley over the trees
So hidons was the noise a benedicite
Certis Jack Straw ne his meyne
Ne made neuir showtes half so shrylle
When that they would any flemyng kylle
As that day was maad up on the fox
Of b^as they blew the trompes and of box
Of horn and boon in which they powpyd
And therewith they shrikyd and shoutyd
It seemed as though heuyn should fall
Now godemen I pray you harkyn all
Lo how fortune turnyth suddenly
The hope and the pride of her envy
This cok that lay up on this foxis bak
In all his dread unto the fox he spak
And said sire if I were as ye
Yet should I say as wis god help me
Turnyth ay^en ye proud chorlis all
A verry pestilence up on you fall
Now am I come unto this wodis side
Magre your head the cok shall here abide
I wol him ete in feith and that anon^
The fox answerde in feith it shall be doon^
And as he spak the word al suddenly
This cok brak from his mouth deliuerly
And high up on a tree he fly anon^
And whenne the fox saw that he was goon^
Alas quod he o chauntecler alas
I have do to you great trespass
In as much as I made you a ferde
Whenne I you hente and brought out of your yerde
But sire I did hit not in no wickid intent
Com down and I shall tell you what I meant
I shall you say soth so god help me so
Nay thanne quod he I shrewe us both two
And first I shrewe my self both blood and bonys
If thou begyle me ofter thanne onys
Thou shall no more with thy flaterye
Do me sing with a wynkyng ye
For he that wynketh when he should se
As wisly god let him neuyr the
Nay quod the fox god give him myschaunce
That is so indiscreet of governance
That iangelith when that he should have p^es
Lo such it is forto be recheles
And negligent and trust on flaterye
But ye that holdyn this tal^ a foly^
As of a fox and a cok and an hen
Takith the moralite good men
For saint Poule says all that writyn is
To our doctrine is writyn y wis
Takith the fruit and leet the chaf be stille
Now good men if that it be your will
As seith my lord so make us all good men
And bring us to his high bliss amen
Here begins the Mauncipelis prolog.
WOot ye not where there sto^dith a litil town
Which that is clepid bob up and down
Under the blee in Cauntirbery wey
There began our oste to ^ape and to pley
And said s^res what don is in the mire
Is th^r noman for prayer ne for hire
That wol awake our felaw behind
A th^ef might him full lightly ro^be and bind
Se ^ow ^e nappeth se for cokkis bonys
How (...) wol fall from his horse attonys
Is that a cook of london with myschaunce
Do him comfort he knows his penance
For he shall tell a tale be my fey
Al though it be not worth a botel hey
Awa^e thou cook quoth he god give the sorrow
What eylith the to sleep be the morrow
Have thou had fleen al night or art thou dronk
Or have thou al night with some queen y swonke
So that thou may not hold up thy head
This cook that was full paal and no thing reed
Said our host so god my soul blis
There is fall on me greet henynes
Not I not why. me were lever to sleep
Than the best galon of wine in chepe
Well quod the Mauncipyl if it may do the ese
To the sir cook and to no wight disp^^^e
Which that here riden in this company
And that our host will of his curtesy
I wol as now excuse the of thy tale
For in good feith thy visage is full ^ale
Thyn yen dasowen sothly as me thinkith
And well I woot thy breath full foul stynketh
That shewith well thou art not well disposid
Of me certain thou shall not be glosid
Se how he galpith lo this dronkyn wight
As though he would swelle anon right
Hold cloos thy mouth be thy fader kyn
The devil of hell set his foot there in
Thy cursid breath enfectith us all
Fie stynkyng swyn foul moot the b^falle
Takith he de sires of this lusty man
Now sweet sire wol ye just at van
Thereto me thinkith ye be well y shape
I trow that ye have dronkyn wyn of ape
And that is when men pleyen a^te straw
And with his speech the cook wexid alwraw
And on the Mauncipyl he began to nodde fast
For lak of speech adoun the horse him cast
Where as he lay til that men him up took
This was a feir cheuesaunce of a cook
Alas that he ne had hold him be his ladyl
And er that he again were in his sadyl
There was a great shouyng both to and fro
To lift him up and mykyl care and woo
So unwieldy was this sely pallyd ghost
And to the mauncipyl than spak our ost
Be cause that drink has dominacion^
Op on this man be my sauacion^
I trow lewdly will he tell his tale
For were it wine or old moisty ale
That he has dronkyn he spekith so in his nose
And fuesith fast and eke he has the pose
He has also to do more than enough
To keep him on his Capyl out of the slough
And if he fall from his Capil eft sone
Than shul we all have enough to done
In liftyng up his dronkyn corpse
Tell on thy tale of him y make I nofors
But yet mauncipyl in feyth thou art to nyce
Thus opynly to reprove him of his vice
Anothir day he will pauenture
Recleyme the and bring the to lure
I mean he speak wol of small thingis
And forto pynche at thy rekenyngis
That were not honest if it came to the preef
No quoth the Mauncipil that were a great myschief
So might he bring me in to the snare
Yet had y lever pay for the mare
Which he ridith on than he should with me strive
I wol not wrath him so mote I th^yue
That I spak I said it but in bourde
And wite ye well I have here in my gourde
A draughte of wine ye of a ryp^ grape
And right anon ye shul se a good Iape
This cook shall drink thereof if I may
Up on my lif he wol not say nay
And certainly to tellen as it was
Of this vessel the cook drank fast alas
What nedith it he drank enough ^eforn^
And when he had poupid in h^s horn^
To the mauncip^l he took the gourde again
And of the drink the cook was full fayn
And thankid him in such wise as he could
Than began our ost to lanwghe wonder loud
And said I se well it is necessary
Where the we goon good drink with us to carry
For that wol turn rancour and d^s^s^
To accord and love and many a word to ^ese
O bacus bliss^d be thy name
That so can turn ernest in to game
Worship and thank be to thy deyte
Of that matter ye get no more of me
Tell on thy tale thou maun^^pil I the prey
Well sire quod ^e herkenyth what I say
Here endith the Maun^^plis ^^olog. And begynnyth his tale.
WHen Phoebus dwellid (...) a down
As old bokis maken mention
He was the most lusty bacheler
Of all the world and eke the best archer
He slough Pheton the serpent as he lay
Slepyng ayens the son up on a day
And many anothir nobil deed
He with his bow wrought as men mow read
Pleye he could on every mynstralcye
And syngen that it was a melodye
To here of his clear vois the soun
Certes the king of Thebes amphion
That with his song wallid the cite
Could never sing half so well as he
Thereto he was the semelist man
That is or was since the world began
What nedith it his feture forto discryue
For in this world was there non so fair a live
He was therwi^h fulfillid of gentilnsse
Of honor and of parfyt worthynesse
This Phoebus that was flour of bachelerye
As well in fredom as in chiualrye
For disporte in sign eek of victory
Of Pheton so as tellith us the story
Was wont to bear in his hond abowe
Now had this Ph^bus in his house a crow
With ynne a cage y fost^id many a day
And taught it speak as men teache a Iay
Wh^t was this crow as is a snow whit swan
And countir^etid the speech of every man
He could when he should tell a tale
There was in all this world non nyghtyngale
Ne could be an hundrid thousand deel
Sing so wonderly merrily and weel
Now had this Phoebus in his house a wife
Which that he loved more than his lif
And night and day did ever his diligence
Here forto plese and do her reverence
Save only the soth if I shall sayn
Ielous he was and would have kept her feyn
For him were loath iapid forto be
And so is every wight in such degree
But al for naught for it auaylid naught
A good wife that is cleen of werk and thought
Should not be kept in non awe certain
And trewly the more it is in veyn
To keep a shrewe for it wol not be
This hold I for a very nycete
To spille labor forto keep wyuys
Thus written old clerkis in her lyuys
But now to purpos as I first began
This worthy Phoebus does all that he can
To plesen her wenyng through such plesaunce
And for his manhood and for his governance
That noman should put him from her grace
But god it woot there may noman enbrace
As to distreyne a thing which that nature
Has naturelly set in a creature
Take any brid and put him in a Cage
And do al thyn intent and thy courage
To fostre it tenderly with mete and drink
Of all deyntees that thou can bethink
And keep it al so clenly as thou may
Al though his cage of gold be never so gay
Yet has this brid by twenty thousand fold
Lever in a f^rest that is wild and cold
Go ete wormys and such wrecchidnes
For ever this brid wol do his besynes
To ascape out of his cage when he may
His liberte the brid desirith ay
Leet take a cat and fostre her with mylk
And tender flesh and make her couche of silk
And leet her se a mous go by the wall
Anon she we^uith flesh and couche and al
And every deynte that is in that house
Such appetit has she to ete the mous
Lo here has lust his domynacion
And appetit flemyth discrecion
As the wolf has also a vilens kind
The lewdist wolf that she may find
Or le^st of reputacion that wol she take
In time when her lust to have a make
All these ensamplis speak I be these men
That been untrue and no thing by women
For men have ever a licorous appetit
On lower thing to ^fourme her delit
Than on her wyuys be they never so feir
Ne never so true ne so deboneir
Flesh is so newfangil with myschaunce
That we ne konne in no thing have plesaunce
That sounyth unto virtue any while
Thus Phoebus which thought no gyle
Disceyued was for all his iolyte
For under him another had she
A man of litil reputacion
Not worth to him in no comparison
The more harm is it happith often so
Of which there comyth much harm and woo
And so befyl when Phoebus was absent
His wife anon has for her lemman sent
Her lemman certis that is a knauyssh speech
Foreyne it me that I you beseech
The wise Plato says as ye mow read
The word must need accord with the deed
If men shul tell propirly a thing
The word must cosyn be to the workynge
I am a boistous man right thus say I
There is but litil difference trewly
Betwix a wife that is of high degree
If of her body dishonest she be
And a pore wenche other than this
If it so be they work both amys
But that the gentil is in staat above
She shall be clepid his lady and his love
And for that other is a power woman
She shall be clepid his wenche or his lemman
And god it woot mine owen dear brother
Men leye as low that on as that other
Right so betwix an open teraunt
And an out law or a thief erraunt
The same I say there is no difference
To Alisaundir was told this sentence
That for the tiraunt is of gretter might
Beforce of meyne to sle down right
And brenne house and hoom and make al pleyn
Lo therefore is he clepid a capteyn
And for the outlawe has but small meyne
And may not do so great harm as he
Ne bring a contre to so greet myschief
Men clepe him an outlawe or a thief
But for I am a man not textuel
I wol not of this trete never a deel
I wol go to my tale as I began
When Phoebus wife had sent for her lemman
Anon they wroughten all their lust volage
This white crow that hyng ay in the cage
Beheld her work and said never aworde
And when hoom was come Phoebus the lord
This crow song cuckoo cuckoo
What b^id quod Phoebus what syngist thou
Ne were thou not wont so merrily to sing
That to my heart it was a rejoicing
To here this vois allas what song is this
Be god quod he y sing not amys
Phoebus quod h^ for all thy worthynes
For all thy beauty and thy gentilnes
For all thy song and thy myns^ral^ye
For all thy waytyng blerid is thyn ye
With one of litil reputacion
Not worth to the in no comparison
The mountaunce of a gnat so moot I thryue
For on thy bed thy wife I saw him swyue
What wol ye more the crow anon him told
By sad tokenys and by wordis bold
How that his wife had don her lecherye
Him to great shame and to great vilonye
And told him eft he saw it with his yen
This Phoebus began a weyward forto prien
Him thought his heart breast a two
His bow he bent and set there ynne a flo
And in his Ire he has his wife slain
This is the effect there is no more to sayn
For sorrow he brak his mynstra^sie
Both harp^ and lute / geterne and sawtrie
And eek he brak his arowis and his bow
And aftir that thus spak he to the crow
Traitor quod he with tunge of scorpion
Thou have me brought to my confusion
Alas that I was wrought why nere I ded
O dear wife O gemme of lusty ^eed
That were to me so sad and eek so true
Now lie thou d^d with face pale of ^ewe
Full giltlees that durst I swear ^wys
O rakyl hond to do so foul amys
O troubil wit O Ire recheles
That vnauysid synnyst giltlees
O wantrust full of suspecion
Where was thy wit and thy discrecion
O every man bewaar of rekilnes
Ne trow no thing without witness
Smyt not to sone or thou wite why
And be auysid well and sikirly
Or ye do any execucion
Up on your Ire for suspecion
Allas a thousand folk have rekil Ire
Fully fordoon and brought hem in the mire
Allas for sorrow I will my self sle
And to the crow o false thief said he
I wol quyte anon thy falls tale
Thou song whylom lik an nyghtyngale
Now shall thou falls thief thy song forgoon
Eke thy white fetheris euerichon
Ne never in all thy lif shall thou speak
Thus shulle men on a treytour be a wreke
Thou and thyn offspring ever shul be blake
Ne never sweet noise shul ye make
But ever cr^e ayens tempest and rayn
In tokyn that thorou the my wif is sleyn
And to the crow he stert and that anon
And pullid of his whit fetheris euerichon
And made him blak and reft him al his song
And eke his speech and out a^te door him slong
Unto the devil which I him betake
And for this caas be all crowis blake
Lordingis by this ensampyl I wol you pray
Bewar and take keep what I say
Ne tellith never noman in your lif
How that anothir man has dight his wife
He will you haten mortally certain
Salamon as wise clerkis sayn
Techith a man to keep his tunge well
But natheles thus taught me my dame
My sone think on the crow a goddis name
My sone keep well thy tunge and kep thy friend
A wickid tunge is worse than a fend
My sone from a fend men may hem bliss
My sone god of his endless godnesse
Wallid a tongue with teth and lippis eek
For man should him auyse what he speek
My sone full often forto mykyl speech
Has many a man be spilt as clerkis teache
But for litil speech spoken auysedly
Is noman shent to speak generally
My sone thy tongue sholdist thou restreyne
At al time but when thou do thy peyn^
To speak of god in honor here
The first virtue sone if thou wolt lere
Is to restreyne and keep well thy tunge
Thus learn childryn when they be young
My sone of mykyl spekyng un auysid
There less spekyng had I now suffisid
Comyth mykyl harm thus was me taught
In mykyl speech sin wantith naught
Wost thou wherefore a rakil tongue seruith
Right as a swerd for cuttith and forkeruith
An arm a two my dear sone right so
A tongue cuttith friendship al a two
A Iangelar is to god abhominabil
Read Salamon so wise and honourabil
Read David and his psalmys read Seneke
My sone spek not ne with thy head thou beke
Dissimyl as thou were deef if that thou here
The Iangelour spekith of parlous matere
The flemyng says learn if that thou list
That litil Iangelyng causith much rest
My sone if thou no wickid word have said
The dar not dread for to be by wraid
But he that has myssaid I dar well sayn
He may by no way clepe his word again
Thing that is said / is said and forth it goth
Though him re^ente or him be never so loath
He is thra^le to him to whom he has said
A tale for w^i^he he is now evil a paid
My son bewaar and be non auctor new
Of tidingis whethir they be falls or true
Where so thou come among hye or low
Keep well thy tongue and think on the crow
Here endith the Maunciplis tale. Here be^ynneth the Parsonnys prolog
BY that the Mauncipil had his tale endid
The son f^o the south side is descendid
So low that hit was to my sight
Degrees of five and twenty of highte
Ten at clock it was so as I guess
For enleuyn foot a litil more or less
My shadow was at that time as there
Of such feet as my length partid were
In.vj. feet equally of proporcion
There with the monys exaltacion
I mean libra alwey began ascend
As we were entering at townys end
For which our ost as he was wont to gye
As in this caas this ioly company
Said in this wise lordingis euerichon^
Now lakkith us no tale more than on^
Fulfillid is my sentence and my decre
Who wol now tell a tale let se
Almost fulfillid is mine ordenaunce
I pray to god so give him right good chance
That tellith this tale to us lustely
Sire priest quod he art thou a vicary
Or art thou a parson say soth be thy fey
Be what thou be break not our pley
For every man save thou has told his tale
Vnbokil and show us what is in thy male
For trewly me thynkith be thy chere
Thou sholdest knytte up well a greet matere
Tell us a fabil anon for cokkis bonys
This Parson answerde al attonys
Thou getist fabil non told for me
For Poule that writith to Timothe
Repreueth hem that weyuen sothfastnesse
And techyn fablis and such wrecchidnesse
Why should I sow draf out of my fist
When I may sow whete if me list
For which I say if that thou list to here
Moralite and of virtuous matere
And than if ye wol give me audience
I would full fayn at cristis reverence
Done you plesaunce leesful as I can
But trustith well I am a sotheryn man
I can not geste rum ram ruf by lettir
And god woot ryme hold I but litil bettir
And therefore if ye lust I wol not gloss
I wol you tell a merry tale in prose
To knit up all this fest and make an end
And Ihesu f^r his grace wit me send
To show you the wey in this viage
Of that ilke parfyt glorius pilgremage
That highte Jerusalem celestial
And if ye vouchesauf anon I shall
Begin up on my tale for which I preye
Tell your auys I can no better seye
But natheles this meditacion
I put it ay under correction
Of clerkis for I am not textuel
I take but the sentence trustith weel
Therefore I make protestacion
That I wol stand to correction
Up on this word we have assentid sone
For as it seemed it was forto done
To enden in some virtuous sentence
And forto give him place and audience
And bad to our ost he should to him sey
That all we to tell his tale him preye
Our oste had the wordis for us all
Sir priest quod he now fair moot you befalle
Says what ye list and we shul gladly here
And with that word he said in this manner
Tellith quod he your meditacion
But hastith you the son wol a down
Beth fructuous and that in litil space
And to do well god send you his grace
Here endith the Parsons prolog. And here begins his tale.
Our sweet lord god of heuene that noman will perisshe but will that we comen
all to the knowleching of him and to the blisful life that is pardurable
Amonesheth us by the prophet Ieremye that says in this wise / Stondeth upon
the weyes / And see and axe ye ^f old pathis That is to seye of old sentencis
Which is good weye / And walks in that weye And that is refresshyng for your
sowlis / Many ben the weyes spirituel that leden folk to our lord Ihesu Crist
And to the regne of glory / Of which weyes / there is a full noble weye and well
couenable which may not faylle to man ne to woman that through sin has
mysgoon fro the right weye of Iherusalem celestial / And this wey is cleped
penitence / Of which man should gladly herkne and inquire with al his ^^rte to
wete / what is penytence or penance / And wit whens it is cleped penytence /
And how many manners ben the actions of worchyng of penytence / And how many
spyces there be of penitence / And which things behouen and apperteynen to
penytence / Saint Ambrose says that penytence is the pleynyng of the man for
the gilt that he has do / And no more to do any thing for the which him ought
to pleyne / And some doctor says / that penance is the waymenting of man that
soroweth f^r his sin And pyneth him self for he has mysdon / Penytence with
certain circumstaunce is verray repentance of man that holdeeth him self in
sorrow and other pain for his ^ giltes / And for he shall be very penitent / He
shall first bewaylen the sins that he has done / And steadfastly purpose in
his heart to have shryfte of mouth / And to do satysfactyon and never for to do
thing (...) which him ought more to bewail or complayn^ (...) to continue in
good works / or ellis his repen^^^^^ may not avail / For as says saint
Ysodre He is a Iapar and a gabber and not very repentant / that eftsoon does
thing for which him owes to repent ne stynte to do sin / may not auaylle
/ But natheles men should take hope that at every time that men falls be it
never so often that he may arise through penytence if he have grace But certainly
it is great doubt /. For as seyth saint Gregore / vimeth arises he out of his
sin / that is charged of evil usage. And therefore repentaunte folk that
stynte for to sin and for to let sin or sin forlete hem / Holy church
holds hem syker of her salvation. / And he that synneth and verily repentith
him in his las^e Holy church hopith his saluaco^n by the great mercy of our
lord Ihesu Crist for his repentance / but take ye the siker and certain way.
/ And now since I have declared you what thing is penance / Now shul ye
understand that there be three actions / the first is that a man be baptized
after that he has sinned saint Augustyn says but he be penytent for his old
synful life / he may not begin the new clean lif / For if he be baptized
without penitence for his old gilt / he reteyneth the mark of baptesme / but
not the grace ne the remission of his synnys til he have verray repentance /
Another defaute is that men done dedly sin after they have received baptesme
/ The third defaute is that men fall in venyal sins after her baptesme fro
day to day^ Thereof says saint Austyn that penance of good and humble folk is
the penytence of every day / The spices of penance ben three / That one of hem
is solemn / Another is comune / And the third is pryue / That penance tha^
is so lempne is in two manners / as is to be put out of holy church in lenton
for slaughter of children and such manner things / Another is when a man has
sinned openly / of which sin the fame is openly known in the contre and
then holy church by Judgment distreyneth him for to do open penance / Som^e
penance is that prestes enjoin men comenly in certain caas as for to go
p^rauenture naked on pilgre^mage or barefoot / Preuy penance is that men done
al day for preuy sins of which we shriuen us privily and receyuen pryue
penance / Now shall thou understand what behooves and is ne^^ssarye to every
preuy penitent / And ^hese stonden in three / Co^tricion of heart / Confession
of mouth And satisfaction / For which John Crisostom says / Penytence
distreyneth to accept benygnely every pain that is him enjoined with
contricion of heart and shryfte of mouth with satisfaction and worching of al
manner humylite And this is fruytful penance against tho things in which we
wratthyn our lord Ihesu Crist / This is to say delight in thinkyng / by
rechelesnes in spekyng / by wicked and synful wirchyng / Against these wicked
giltes is penance That may be likened to a tree. The ro^e of this tree is
contricion that hydeth him in the heart of him that is very repentante right
as the rote of a tree hydeth him in the earth / Of the rote of contricyon
spryngeth a stalk that bears branches and leuys of confession and fruit of
satisfac^ion Of which crist says in the gospel / Do ye digne fruit of
penytence / For by this fruit men may know this tree and not by the rote that
is hyd in the heart of a man / Ner by the braunchis ne leeuys of confession /
And therefore our lord Ihesu Crist says thus / by the fruit of hem ye shall
know hem / Of this rote spryngeth a seed of grace which seed is mother of
sikernes / And this seed is eger and hoot / the grace of this seed spryngeth of
god through the remembrance of the day of dome and of the peynes of hell / Of
this matter Salamon says that in the dread of god a man forlettith his sin /
The heete of this seed is the love of god and desiryng of the joy perdurable /
This hete draws the heart of man to god and does him hate his sin / For
there is nothing that sauoureth^ so sote to a child as the milk of hi^ no^ice /
ne nothing is to him more abominable than that mylk when it is medlid with
other mylk / Right so the synful man that loves his sin / hit seems it is
to him most sweet of any thing But fro that time that he loves sadly our lord
Ihesu Crist and desires the life pardurable / there is to him no thing more
abominable / For soth the love of god is the law of god / For which david
the prophet says / I have loved thy law and hated wickedness / he that loves
god keeps his law and his word / This the prophet Daniel Inspired upon the
vision of Nabugodonosor when he counceilled him to do penance / Penance is of
the tree of life to hem that it receyuen / And he that holds him very penitent
is blessid after the sentence of salamon / In this Penitence or contricion man
shall understand four things / that is to sa^e what is contricion / And
which ben the causes that me^en a man to contricion / And how he should be
contryte / And what contrico^n avails to the soul / Than is hit thus that
contricion is the verry sorrow that a man restreyneth in his heart for his
sins with sad purpose to shryue him and to do penance and never more to do
sin / And this sorrow shall be in this manner as says saint bernard / hit shall
be grievous and heavy and well sharp and poynaunt in heart First for a man has
agilted his lord and his creator And more sharp and poynaunt for he has
agilted his fader celestial / And yet more sharp and poynant for he has
wrathid him and agylte him that bought him that with his precious blood has
deliueryd him from the bonds of sin and fro the cruelte of the devil and
fro the peynes of hell / These causes that meue a man to contricion ben.vj.
First man shall remember him of his synnys / But look that remembrance be to
him no delight by no weye but great shame and sorrow for his gylte. / For Job
says / Synful men done werkis worthy of confu^ion /. And therefore says
Ezechyel / I will remember me all the yeris of my life in bitterness of my heart /.
And god says in the Apocalips / Remember you fro whens that ye befalle /. For
before the time that ye sinned ye were the children of god and lymys of the
regne of god /. But for your sin ye ben waxen thral and ^oule membris of the
fend. Hate of angels / sklaundre of holy church / and food of the false
serpent / perpetuel mat^er of the fire of hell. And that more foul and
abhomynalle for ye trespace as often time as does the hound that torneth again to
ete his owen spuyng. / And yet fouler for your l^nge contynuyng in sin and
your sinful usage. / For which ye be roten in your synnys as a be in his
dung / Such manner thoughtis makes a man a shamed f^r his synnys and no delight
as says the proph^te Ezechiel. Ye shul remember you of your weyes / and they
shall displese you Sothly syunys ben the weyes that led folk to hell. / The
second cause that ought to make a man have desdaign^ of sin is th^s as says
Saint Petir / Who so does sin is thrall to sin. / And sin puts a man
in great thraldom. And therefore says the prophet Ezechiel I went sorrowful
and had disdeign^ of my self / Certes well ought a man have disdaigne of sin
and withdraw him fro that thraldom and vilonye. / For lo what says Seneca in
this matter He says thus. Though I wyste that neither god ne man should never
know it / yet would I have d^sdaygn^ for to do sin /. And the same Seneca
says I am born to gretter things than to be thralle to my body / More thralle
may no man ne woman make of his body than give his body to sin. And were it
the fowlest chorle or the fowwst woman that lives and lest of value / yet he
is charged and most foul and most in servitude ever fro the hyer degree that a
man falls The more is he thral and more to god and to the world vile and
abominable / O good god well ought a man have disdeygne of sin since that
thorugh that / there as he was fre now is he made bond / And therefore says
saint Austyn If thou have disdayn of thy servant / If ^e agilt or sin Have
thou then no disdayn that thou thy self shooldest do sin / Take reward of
thyn owhen value / that thou ne be to foul to thy self ne to thine / Allas well
oughten they that have disdayn to be servants and thrall to sin. Sore to be
a shamed of him self / that god of his endless goodness has set in high astate
or give him strength of body / beauty / prosperyte / and bought him fro the
death with his heart blood / that they so unkindly against his gentylnes quyten
him so vilonsly to slaughter of her owen sowlis. O good god ye women that been
of great beauty remember you on the Proverb of Salamon / he says He lykneth a
fair woman that is a fool of her body to a ring of gold that is worn in the
groyn of a Sow. For right as a sow wroteth in every ordure / so wroteth she
her beauty in stynkyng ordure of sin /. The third cause That ought to m^ue a
man to cortry^on is dread of the day of dome / And the horrible pains of hell
/. For as says saint Iherome / At every time that I remember of the day of
dome / I quake for when I ete or drink or do what so I do / ever me seems
the trompe sowneth in mine eres /. Ryseth up that been deed and come ye to the
Judgment. O good god much ought a man to dread such a Judgment there as we
shall be all / As says saint Paul /. Before the strayt Judgment of our lord
Ihesu Crist /. where as we shall make a general congregation / where as no man
may be absent / For certes there avails non ess^yne ne none excusacion And not
only that our fawtes shall be Iuged but eke our works shall openly be known
And that as says saint Bernard / There ne shall no pl^tyng avail ne no
sleyghte / We shall give rekenyng of every idle word /. There shall we have a
Judge that may not be deceyuyd ne corrupt And why for certes al our thoughts be
discouerd as to him ne for prayer ne for mede he will not be corrupt / And also
he says The wrath of god will not spare no wight for prayer ne for yeft / And
therefore at day of dome there is none hope / Wherefore as says saint Ancelme
Full great anguysh shall the synful folk have at that time where shall be the
stern and wroth Judge syttyng above / And under him the horrible pyt of hell
open to destroy him that would not beknowen his synnys / which sins shullen
openly be showed before god and every creature / And on the lift side mo
deuylles than the heart may think for to harrye and draw the synful sowles to
the pytte of hell. And withyn the hertes of folk shall be the bityng consci^nce
/ and without forth shall his works accuse him. Then shall the wrecchid soul
fle to hyde him But certes he may not hyde him he must come forth and show him
For certes as says saint Iherome / the ^rthe shall cast him out of him and the sea also and the Eyer also that shall be full of thunder clappis and lightnyng /
Now sothly who so will remember him of these things I guess that his sins
shall not torn him to delight but to great sorrow for dread of the pain of hell
/ And therefore says Job to god Suffer lord that I may a while bewail and
bewepe or I go retornyng to the derk earth and coueryd with derkenes / the
land of miserye and of derknes where as is shadow of death where as there is
none other ordenan^ce but grisly dread that ever shall last / Lo here may ye
see that Job prayde respyte awhyle to bewepe and wayle his trespaas / For
sothly one day to respyte is better than all the tresour of this world And for
as much as a man may acquyte him self by fore god by penitence in this world
and not by tresour ^ Therefore should he pray to god to give him respyte awhyle
to be wepen and bewaylen his trespaas / For certes all the sorrow that a man
might make fro the beginning of the world nys but a lityl thing at regard of
the sorrow of hell ^. The cause why that Job chepeth the land of derknes ^
vn^derstondeth that he clepeth hit land or earth / for it is s^able and never
shall faylle derkenes / For ^e that is in hell ^ath defaute of light naturel /.
For certes the derk light that shall come out of the fire that ever shall brenne
shall torn hem al to pain that be in hell / For it shewith him all the
horrible d^uylles that hem tormente couerd with the derknes of death that been
the sins that the wrecchyd man has don / Which that destourben him to see
the face of god / Right as a derk cloud between us and the son Land of
mysese by cause that there be three defautes against three things that folk of
this world have in this present life / that is to say / honouris / delytes /
and riches / Against honor have they in hell shame and confusion / For well ye
wot they clepen honor the reverence that men don to men / but in hell is
none honor ne reverence / For certes no more reverence shall be there to a king
than a knave / For which god says by the prophet Iheromye / The folk that me
dispysen shall be in despyte /. Honor is eke cleped a great lordshyp / there
shall no wight seruen other / but of harm and torment Honor is eke cleped
great dignyte and highness but in hell shall they all be fortroden with
deuylles as god says / The h^rrible deuylles shulle goo and common upon heedes
of dampened folk / And this is for as much that the hyer that they were in this
present life the more they shul be abated and defowl^d in hell / Against the
riches of this world / shall they have mysese of pouerte / And this pouerte shall
be in.iiij. things In defawte of tresour of which D^uid says / The rich
folk that enbracen and coueyten in all her heart the riches of this world shulle
sleep in the slepyng of death / as nothing shul they find in there hondes of
all her tresour / And more over the mysese ^f hell shall be in defaute of mete
and drink. For god says thus by Moses / Ye shall be wasted with hunger. And
the birds of hell shall devour hem with bitter death. And the galle of the
dragon her morsellis / And ^ertherouer her mysese shall be in defaute of
clothing for they shall be naked in body as of clothing / Save the fire in
which they brenne and other fylthes / And naked shall they be in soul of all
manner virtues / which that is the clothing of soul / Where ben then the gay
robis and the soft shetis and fyn shertis / Lo what says god of hem by the
prophet Ysaye / that under hem shall be strawed mothes and her couertours shall
be of wormys of hell /. And furtherouer her mysese shall be in defaute of
friends for he is not pour that has good friends / but there is no friend /.
For neither god ne good creature shall be friend to hem And every of hem shall
hate other with dedely hate / The sons and the daughters shul rebelle against
the fader and mother / And kynrede against kynrede and chyden and d^s^pisen each
other both day and night / as god says by the prophet Micheas / And the
loving children that som^e time loueden so flesshely euerich of them would ete
other if he might / For how should they love to gyder in the pryn^s of hell /
when they hated each other in the prosperyte of this life / For trust well / her
fleshly love is dedly hate as says the prophet David / who so loves
wickedness ^e ^a^tith his soul / And who so hates his owen soul / Certes he
may love none other wight in no manner / And therefore in hell is no friendship
but ever the more cursyng the more chydyng and the more dedly hate is among
hem^ And furtherouer they shall have defautes of all manner deli^^s for why /
For delites ben app^tites of the w^tte^ as sight Heeryng / smellyng / sauouryng
/ and towchyng. But in ^elle her sight shall be full of derknes / of smoke and
full of teris And her heeryng full of weymenting and of gruntyng of teth as says
Ihesu Crist / Her nostrellys shall be full of stynkyng /. And as says Ysaye the
Prophet / Her sauouryng shall be full of bitter galle / And as touching her
body it shall be coueryd with fire that never shall be quenchid / And with wormys
that never shall deye as god says by the mouth of Ysaye / And for as much as
they shul not wene that they mow deye for pain and by her death fle fro pain.
that may they understand in the word of Job that says that there is the shadow
of death /. Certes a shadow has a lykenes of the thing of which it is
shadowyd /. Right so farith the peyn of h^lle / it is like death for the
angwissh horrible / and why / For it peyneth hem ever as though men should dye
anon / But certes they shall not dye / For as says saint Gregore / to wrecchid
caytyfs shall be death without death and end without end and defaute without
faylyng / For her death shall all way live / And her end shall evermore begin /
and her defaute shall neu^r fail /. And therefore says saint John the
Euaungeliste / They shall follow death and they shall not find him and to desire
to dye and death shall fle fro them / And eke Job says That in h^lle is none
order of r^ule /. And al be it so that god has created all in right order /
and nothing without order / But all things be ordained and nombred. Yet
natheles they that be dampened be no thing in order ne hold non order / For the
earth shall bear hem no fruit /. For as the prophet David says / God shall
destroy the fruit of the earth from hem / Ne water shall give hem no moisture ne
the eyer no refresshyng / ne the fire no light For as says saint Basyle / The
brennyng of the fire of this world shall god give to hem that been dampened in
hell But the light and the clerenes shall be yeuen in heaven to his children /
right as the good man yeueth breed to his children and bones to his hounds /
And so they shall have none hope to escape / And therefore speaks Job / At
last there shall horror and grisly dread dwellen withouten end^ Horror is all
way dread of harm that is to come / And this dread shall ever dwell in the
hertes of ^em that been dampened. And therefore have they los^ al her hope for.v^.
causes / First for god that is her Judge shall be withouten mercy to hem / ne
they may not plese him ne none of his halowis / ne may pay no thing for her
raunson ne they hau^ no ^^ys to speak to him / ne they mow not ^le fro ^^^ne.
And therefore says Salamon the wicked man deyeth And when he is deed he shall
have none hope to escape from pain / Who so would well understand these peynes
and bethynke him well that he has deseruyd the peynes for his sins / Certes
he should have more talent to syghe and weep than for to sing and for to play
/ For as says Salamon / who that had the science for to know the peynes that been establysshyd and ordained for sin ^e would forsake sin / That science
says saint Austyn makith a man to weymenten in his heart.

The fourth point that a man ought to make contricion fore / is the sorouful
remembrance of the good that he has left to do ^ere in earth and eke the
good that he has lorn / Sothly the good werkis that he has left / ^yther
they be the good werkis that he wrought er he fill in to dedely sin / or
ellis the good werkis that he wrought while he lay in dedely sin / Sothly the
good that he did beforn that he fyl in dedely sin ben al mortyfyed astoned
and dulled by the eft synnyng /. The other works that he wrought while he lay
in sin ben utterly deed as to the life perdurable in heaven /. Than thilke good
works that been mortyfy^d by efte synnyng which good works he did whiles he
was in charity mow never quycken again without verey restreynt and wythdrawyng
the strenges of man's courage and the meuynges in his heart in such manner as
they ne skyppe out by anger ne by Ire /. And thereof says god by the mouth of
Ezechiel / That if the rightful man return again from his ryghtwysnes and to
wirche wickedness. / shall he lyuen / nay /. For all the good werkis that he
has wrought shulle never be in remembrance /. For he shall dye in his sin /
And upon that chappytre says Saint Gregory thus that we shall understand
pryncypally that when we do dedely sin it is naught. Neither for to draw in
to memory the good works that we have wrought byforn^. For certes in the
werkyng of dedely sin there is no trust to good werk that we have don beforn^
/ That is to say as to have there by the life pardurable in heaven / But sothly
the good works that men don whiles they ben in dedly sin for as my^^l as
they were don in dedely sin they may never quycken /. For certes thyngis that
never had life may never quycken And natheles al be it that they avail not to
have the life perdurable / yet auaylen they to a brygge of the pain of hell Or
ellis to get temporel riches / or ellis that god will ra^ther enlumyne and
lighten the heart of the synful man to have repentance /. And eke they avail
to a man to do good werkis that the fend has the less power of his soul And
thus the curteys lord Ihesu Crist will that no good work be lost / For in
sumwhat it shall auaylle / but for as much as the good werkis that men don
whiles they ben in good life been al mortifyed by sin following / And eke since
all the good works that men don whylis they be in dedly sin ben utterly
deed as for to have the life perdurable / well may that man that no good werk
does sing that fresh new song / Iay tout perdu mon temps et mon labor /. For
certes it bereueth a man goodness and na^ture and eke the goodness of grace / For
soth the grace of the holy ghost farith as fire that may not be idle / For fire
fails anon as it leseth his werchyng / Than leseth the synful man the goodness
of glory that only is be^oten to good men that labouren and werken / well may
he be sorry then that owes al his life to god as long as he lives And eek as
long as he shall live / that no goodness has to pay with his debt to god to
whom ^e owes al his life For trust well ^e shall give acountys As says Saint
Bernard / of all the goods that have be yeuyn him in this present life / And
how he has dispendid them / not so much that there shall perysshe an here of
his heed ne a moment of an hour that he ne shall give thereof a rekenyng The
fyfthe thing is that ought to meue a man to contrycion is remembrance of the
passion that our lord Ihesu suffrid for our synnys / For as says saint Bernard
/ whylis that I live I shall have remembrance of the trauayllis that our lord
Ihesu Crist suffryd in prechyng / his werynes in trauelyng / his temptacions
when he fasted / his long wakyngis when he prayed. his teris when he wept for
pity of good people / the woo and the shame and the fylthe that men seyden to
him. of the foul spittyng that men spytten in his face / of the buff^^tys that
men yaf him / of the foul mouthis and of the foul repreuys that men to him
sayden of the naylis with the which he was nailed to the Cross / and of all
the remenaunt of his passion that he suffryd f^r mannys sin and nothing for
his gylt / And ye shall understand the eu^ry manner order of ordenaun^e is
turned up so down / For it is soth that god and reason and sensualyte and the
body of a man be so ordained. that euerich of these four things shul have
lordship over that other as thus god should have lordship over reason / and r^s^n
over sensualyte and sensualyte over the body of man / But sothly man seems all this order of ordenaunce is turned up so down /. And therefore then for as
mykyl as the reason of man will will not be ^ubget ne obeissaunt to god that is
lord by right Therefore leseth it the lordship that it should have in s^nsualite
and eke over the body of man / And why for sensualite rebelleth then against
reason / And by that wey ^^sith reason his lordship over sensualite and over the
body. For right as reason is rebel to god / Right so is sensualite rebel to
reason and the body also / And certes this orde^naunce And this rebellion our
lord Ihesu Crist aboughte upon his body well deer / and ^erkeneth in which
wise. For as mykyll then as reason is reb^ll to god therefore is man worthy to
have sorrow and to be deed / This suffrid our lord Ihesu for man after he was
betrayed of his disciple and distreyned and bound so that the blood brast out at
every naylle of his hondes as says saint August^n^ And ferthermore for as
mykyl as reason of man will not daunte sensualite when it may / Therefore is man
worth^ to have shame / And this suffered our lord Ihesu Cris^ for man when they
spitten in his visage ^ And ferther over then for as much as the caytyf body
of man is rebel both to reason and to sensualite therefore i^ is worthy the
deth^ And this suffrid our lord Ihesu Crist f^r man upon the cross / Where as
there was no part of his body fre without great pain and bitter passion And all this suffered Ihesu Crist that never forfeted / To much am I peyned for tho
things that I never deseruyd and to myk^l defouled for friendship that man is
worthy to haue^ And therefore may the sinful man well say as saint Bernard s^ith
A cursid be the bitterness / For certis after diuers^ discordaun^es of our
wickedness was the passion of Ihesu Crist y ordained in diverse things as thus
/ Certes synful man's soul be^trayd the devil by couetyse of temporel
prosperity and sco^nys by disceyt when he chefith flesshly delites / And is
tormentyd be Impacyence of aduersite and bespet by seruage in subiectyon of
sin / And at last he is slain finally / For this discordance of synful man
/ was Ihesu Crist first betrayed / and aftir that was he bound that came for to
unbind us of sin and of the pain / Then was he bescourged that only should
be honourid in all thingis and of al thingis / Then was his visage bespyt
that ought to be desired for to be seyn of al mankind / In which visage
angels desiren to look / and theryn was vilenisly bespe^te / Then was he
scorrned that nothing had gilt / And finally then was he crucified and sleyn.
Then were complished the words of Ysaye that says. He was wounded for our
misdedis and defouled for our vilonyes / Now since that Ihesu Crist took on him
self the pain of al our wickedness / mikyl ought sinful man to weep and to
bewaylle that for his sins goddis sone of heaven should all this pain endure.
The.xj. thing that ought to meue a man to contricion is the hope of three
things that is to say forgifnes of sin / and the yefte of grace well for to
do / And the joy of heaven with the which god shall guerdon man for his good
deeds / And for as much as Ihesu Crist yeuyth us the yeftis of his grace and
of his souerayn bounte / Therefore is he cleped Ihesus nazerenus r^^ Iu^eorum /
Ih^sus is for to say savior or sauacion on whom men shul hopen to have
foryeuenes of synnys / Why^he that is properly sauacion of synnys. / And
therefore said the an^gel to Joseph / Thou shall clep^ his name Ihesus that shall
save his people of her synnys. And hereof says saint Peter / There is none other
name under heuyn that is yeuyn to any man by which aman may be sauyd but only
Ihesus / Nazarenus is as much for to say as florisshyng in which a man shall
hope that he that yeuyth him remission of synnys shall also give him grace well
for to do / For in the flour is hope of fruit in time coming / And in
foryeuenes of sin hope of grace well to do I was at door of thyn heart said
Ihesus and cleped for to enter / he the opens to me shall have foryeuenes of
synnys I will enter in to him by my grace / and soupe with him by the good
werkis that he shall do / which werkis ben the fode of god / And he shall ^ope
with me by the great joy that shall be youen to him / Thus shall man hope that
for his werkis of penance god shall give him his regne as he be^hoteth him in
the gospel / Now shall man understand in what manner shall be his contricion / I
say hit shall be universal and total / that is to say a man shall be very
re^entaunt for all his synnys that he has don in delight of his thought / For
delight is perisous / For t^^r be two manners of consentynges that one of hem is
cleped consentyng of affection / When a man is meuyd to do sin against the
law of god / Al though his reason consent not to do sin in d^de Yet seyn
som^e doctors and men that such delight that dwell^th long is full perylous /
al be it never so lyte / And also a man shoold sorrow namely for all that ever
^e has desired again the law of god with parfight consentyng to the deed
Wherefore I say that many men repent ^em never of such thoughts and delytes
and never shriue hem of it but only of the deed of great sins outward /
wherefore I say that such wicked delites and wicked thoughts ben subtle
begilars of hem that shall be dampened / More over man ought to sorrow for his
wicked words and for his wicked deeds / For certes repentance of a ^inguler
sin and not repentyng of all his other synnys / or ellis repenting him of al
his other sins and not of a synguler sin may not avail / For certes god
almighty is all good And therefore he foryeuyth all or ellis right naught / And
therefore says saint Austyn / I wot certainly the god is enemy to every synnar
/ And how than he that observes one sin / shall he have foryeuenes of the
remeneunt of his other synnys / nay / And ferther over contricion should be
wonder sorouful and auguysshous / And therefore yeuyth him god plainly his mercy
/ And therfo^e when my soul was auguysshous within me I had remembrance of
god that my prayer might come to him / Furtherouer contricion must be
continuel and that men have steadfast pur^^se to shryue hem and for to amend
hem of her lif For sothly ^^^yle contricion lasts / man may have hope of
foryeuenes / And of this comes hate of sin that destroieth sin both in
him self and eke in other folk at his power / For which David says / Ye that
louen god / hate wickedness /. For trusts well to love god is for to love that
he loves and hate that he hates. The last thing that a man shall understand in
contricion is this whereof auaylleth contricion / I say sometime the contricion
deliuerith a man fro synn^ / of which david says / I say quoth david / I
purpose fermli to shriue me and thou lord have relecid my sin And right so as
contricion auaylleth not wit^oute sad purpose of shrifte and satisfaction /
right so confession ne satisfaction avail not without contricion. For much
contricion destroys the prison of hell / and makes week and feeble the
strength of t^^ devil / and restoryth the yefte of the holy ghost and of all
vertuys and interclen^ith the soul of sin and deliueryth the soul fro the
pain of hell and fro the company of the devil / And fro seruage of sin /
and restorith to all goods spirituel in to the company and com^unyon of holy
church / And fertherouer hit makes him that was whylom sone of ire / to be
the sone of grace / And all these things he puts to holy wryt / And
therefore he that will set his intent to these things he were full wise / For
then he should not in all his life have courage to sin / But then his body
and all his heart he should confourme to the seruyse of Ihesu Crist / And
therefore do him homage for certes our sweet lord Ihesu Crist has sparid us so
benyngly in our folyes that if he ne had pity on man's sow^^^ sorry song might
we all sing /.

Explicit prima pars penitencie. Incipit secunda pars.
THe second part of penitence is confession / and that is sign of contricion /
Now shall ye understand what is confession / and whethir hit ought needs to be
or none ^ And which things be couenable to very confession ^ First shall thou
understand that confession is very showing of sin to the priest / this is to
say verry / For he must confess him of all the conditions that be longyng to
his sin as ferf^^th as ^e can / all must be said and nothing excused ne hid
ne forwrappid and not auaunte him of his good werkis / And fertherouer it is
necessary to understand whens that synnys spryngen / And how they encrecen /
And there ben spryngyng of synnys as seyth saint Poule in this wise / That right
as by a man sin entryd first in to this world / and through that sin deyde
/ Right so death entryd in to all men that synneden And this man was adam by
whom that sin entryd in to this world / when he brak the commandment of god
And therefore he that first was so mighty that he should not have deyd / becam
such one that he must needs deye whether he would or no and al his progenye
that is in this world that in that manner sin deyen / Look that in the state
of Innocence when Adam and Eve were naked in paradyse and no shame had of her
nakydnes. how that the serpent that was most wyly of al other bestes that god
had made said to the woman / commanded god to you ye should not ete of every tree
in paradyse / The woman answered of the f^uyt said she of the trees in paradyse
we feden us / But sothly ^f the fruit of the tree that is in the myddel of
paradyse / god forbad us for to eten ne to tou^he it lest perauenture we shall
deye / The serpent said to the woman / nay / nay / ye shall not deye of death For
soth god wot that what day that ye ete thereof your ^yen shall open and ye shall
be as gods knowing good and harm / The w^man saw that the tree was good to
fed^ng and fair to the eye and delectable to the sight / She took of the fruit
of the tree and ete of hit. And yaf of hit to her husbonde / and he eet / And
anon the eyes of hem both opend / And when they knew that they were nakyd /
they sowid of a fyg tree leeuys in manner of brechis to hiden her membris / Here
may ye see that dedely sin has first suggestion of the fend / As shewith
here by the adder / And afterward the delight of the flesh as shewith here by
Eve / And after by consentyng of reason as shewith by Adam / For trust well
though so were the fend tempted one that is to say the flesh / And the flesh
had delight in the beauty of the fruit defendid / Yet certes til that reason that
is to say Adam consentid to the etyng of the fruit / he stood high in the
state of Innocence Of that Adam took we that sin of oryginal / For of him
flesshl^ descended ben we all and engendrid of vile and corupt matter / And
when the soul is put in our body right anon is contract origynal sin / And
that was onl^ pain of concupiscence / which is afterward both pain and sin
And therefore be we all born sons of wrath: of dam^^nacion perdurable if ne
were baptesme that we rece^ue^ which benymeth us the culpe but forsothe the
pe^nes dwell with us as the temptacion / Which pe^ne highte concu^piscence /
And this concupiscence when it is wrongfully disposed or ordained in man / hit
makes him coueyte couetyse of flesh and fleshly sin by sight of his eyes as
to erthely things / And eke couetyse of highness by pride of heart / Now as for
to speak of the first couetyse that is concupiscence after the law of our
members that were lawfully made and by rygh^ful Judgment of god I say for as
much as a man is not obeyssaunt to god that is his lo^d Therefore is his heart
to him disobeyssant / through concupiscence / hit is Impossible but he be
tempted some time and noyed in his flesh to sin / And this thing may not fail
as long as he lives / hit may well wexe feeble and fail by virtue of baptesme /
And by the grace of god through penytence / But fully shall it never quench That
he ne shall sometime be meuyd in him self / but if he were al refreyned by
sykenes or by malice of sorcerye or cold drynkes /. For what says s^ynt Poule
/ The flesh coueyteth against the spirit / And the spiryt against the flesh they
ben so contrary / And so stryuen that man may not do always as he would / The
same saint Paul after his great penance in water and in land by night and b^
day by great paryl and in great pain in land in great famyn and thryst in
cold and ones stoned almost to the death / Yet said he alas I caytyf man / who
shall delyuere me fro the prison of my caytyf body / And Saint I^^rome said /
when he long time had dwellid in desert / Where as he had no company but
bestes where as he had no mete but h^rbes and water to his drynk ne no bed but
the naked earth /. For which is flesh was blak as an E^hyope for hete and
destroyed for ^olde / Yet said he the brennyng of lechery boyll^d in all his
body / Wh^rf^re I wot well sikerly that they be disc^yuyd that say that they be
not tempted in her sede springyng / As well may the chorle be saved as the lord
The same death that the chorle takes the lord takes /. Wherf^r^ I read do
right so by thy chorle / as thou would thy lord did with the if thou were in
his plight. Every synneful man is chorle to sin / I read the certes thou lord
that thou reule the in such wise that thy chorles rather love the then hate
the / I wot well there is degree above degree as reason is and skille is that men
do her deuoyr there as it is due / But certes extorcions and despites of your
underlings is dampnable And furthermore understand w^l that conquerours or
tyrauntis maken well often thrallis of hem that been born of as ryall blood as
they that him conqueryn / This name of thraldom was never known ^^rst til that
Noe said / his sone Canaan should be thral to his brethern for his sin / What
say we then of them that pylle and do extorcions to holy church / Certes
the swerd that men yeuyn first to a knight when he is new dub^yd signefyeth
that he should defend holy church and not r^^b^ hem / And who so does is a
traitor to Crist as sayt^ saint Austyn / Tho ben the deuyllis woluys that
strange (...) the sheep of Ihesu Crist and den worse than woluys For soth when
the wolf has full his womb he s^ynteth to strang^^ sheep / But sothly the
pyllours and destroyers of g^^des of holy church do not so / For they s^ynte
never to pylle. Now have I said syn so is that sin was first cause of
thraldom and subjection / But certes since the time of grace came / god ordained
that some folk should be made more in high astate and high degree / and some folk
more low And that euerich should be served in his astate and his degree. And
therefore in some contrees t^^re as they ben thrallis. When they have turned hem
to the fe^th they make her thrallis fre out of thraldom / And therf^re cer^es
the lord owes to his man / that the man owes to the lord The Pope clepeth him
self servant of servants of god / But for as much as the state of holy
church might not be kept in rest ne in p^es in earth / but if god had
ordained that some men have heyer degree / and some men lower / Therefore was
souereynte ordained to keep and maintene and defend her vnderlyngis or her
subie^tes in reason as ferforth as it lies in her power / and not to destroy
hem ne confound / Wherefore I say thilke lords ben woluys that deuouren the
possessions or the catel of other folk wrongfully without mercy or mesure /
They shul be releuyd by the same mesure that they have mesured to pour folk
for the mercy of Ihesu Crist but they it amend / Now shul ye understand in
what manner sin weyith and encresi^h in man / The first thing is that
norisshyng of sin of which I spak before that is concupiscence / And after
that comes suggestion of the devil / that is to say the deuyllis below /
with which he blowith in man the fire of concupiscence / And after that a man
bethinketh him whether he wol do or no that thing to which he is tempted / And
than if that a man wythstont and weyue the first tysyng of his flesh and of the
fend / than it is no sin / and if so be he do not than feleth he anon a
flame of del^te / And than it is good to bewaar and to keep him well or ellis he
wol fall anon in to consentyng of sin / And than will he do hit if he may
have time and space / And of this matter says Moses by the devil in this manner
/ The fend says I will chase and poursiewe the man by wickid suggestion / and
I will honte him by meuyng or stering of sin / and I will deprarte my pryse or
my pray by deliberacion / and my lust shall be accomplisshed in delight. I will
draw mine swerd in consentyng / For certes right as a swerd departs one in
two pecys / right so cons^nting departs god from man / And then will I sle
him with my hand in death of sin / Thus says the fend / For certes then
is a man al deed in soul / And thus is sin complysshid by temptacion / by
delight and by consentyng /. And then sin is cleped a meruayll / For soth
sin is in two manners / either it is venial or dedely sin Sothly when a man
loves any creature more than Ihesu Crist our creator then is hit dedely
sin / And venyal sin if a man love Ihesu Crist less than him ought /
Forsothe the deed of this venyal sin is full perilous for hit amenusith the
love that men should have to god more and more / And therefore if a man charge
more him self with many such venyal sins / Certes but if so be that he
discharge of hem by shryfte / they may well lightly amemis^ in him all the love
that he has to Ihesu Crist And in this wise skyppeth venyal sin in to dedely
sin / For certes the more that a man chargith his soul with venyal synnys
the more is he inclined to dedely sin / And therefore leet us not be necligent
in dischargyng us of venyal sin. For the proverb says many small makyth a
greet /. And herkene this ensample / a great wawe of the sea comyth sometime
with so greet a violence that it drenschith the ship And the same harm do
sometime the small dropes of water that enter through a lityl creuys in the
thurrok and in the bottom of the shipp if men be so negligent that they
discharge hem not by time / And therefore al though th^r be difference between
these two causes of drenchyng / yet algates the ship is dreynt / Right so
farith it sometime of dedly sin and of anoyous venyal synnys when they
multeplye in man so greatly that the worldly things that he loves through
which he synneth venyally is as great in his heart as the love of god or more
/ And therefore the love of every thing that is not beset ne don princypally
for gods sake / all though a man loves less than god / yet is it venyal
sin And dedely sin is when the love of any thing weyeth in the heart of man
as much as the love of god or more. Dedely sin as says saint Austyn is when
a man torneth his heart from god which that is very souerayn bounte that may
not be changed / And yeueth his hert^ to a thing that may change and flytte /
And certes that is every thing save god of heaven / Forsooth if that a man give
his love which he owes to god with all his h^rte unto a Creature certes so
much of love as he yeueth to such a Creature / so much bereueth he fro god /
And therefore does he sin For he that is dettour to god ne yel / death not al
his debt to god that is to say all the love of his heart / Now since a man
understands generally which is venyal sin / than is it couenable to tell
specially of sins which that many a man perauenture demeth hem not synnys
and shryueth hem not of the same sins. And yet nath^les they be sins. And
sothly as clerkis written this is to say that every time that a man eteth or
drynketh more than suffyseth to sustenaunce of his body certain he does sin
/. Eke when he herkeneth not the compleynt of the pour men /. Eke when he
speaks more than hit needs it is sin. / Eke when he is in health of body and
will not fast when other men fast without cause reasonable / Eke when he
slepeth more than needs / or when he comes by that encheson to late to
church or to other werkys of charity / Eke when he vfith his wife withouten
desire souerayn of engendrure to the honor of god or for thentent to yield his
wife the debt of his body / eke when he will not visit the syke or the
prisoners when he may / eke if he love wife or child or any other wordly thing
more than reason requires / eke if he flatere or blaundyse more than him ought
for any necessite Eke if he amenuse or withdraw the alms of the pour / eke
if he appareylle his mete more deliciously than need is or ete it to hastily by
lichorousnes Eke if he talk vanytees in the church or at gods seruyse or
that he be a talker of idle words of folly or of vilonye / For he shall give
acountes of hit at the day of dome / eke when he behoteth or assures to do
things that he may not perform / eke when ^y lyghtnes of folly mysseyeth or
scornyth his neighbor / Eke when he has any wicked suspecion of thing there
be woot of hit no sothfastnes / These things and moo with outen nombre be
sins as says saint Austyn / Now shall ye understand that al be hit so that
none erthely man may eschew all venyal sins / yet may be refreyne him by
the brennyng love that h^ has to our lord Ihesu Crist / And by prayers and
confession and other good works so that it shall but lityl grieve / For as says
saint Austyn / if a man love god in such manner that all that ever ^e does is in
the love of god or for the love of god / look hou mykyl that a drope of water
that fallith in a furneys full of fire annoyeth or greuith so mykel anoieth a
venyal sin unto a man that is parfight in the love of Ihesu Crist / Men may
also refreyne venyal sin by the receyuyng of the precious body of Ihesu Crist
/ by receyuyng eke of holy water / by alms deed / by general confession of
confiteor at mass and at pryme and complyne / and by blissyng of bisshopps and
of preestis and by other good werkis.

De septe^ peccatis mortalibus. Incipit de superbia.
NOw it is behouely thing to tellyn which ben dedely sins / that is to say
caytif of sins / All they run in to colis but in diuerce manner / Now be
they cleped caytifs for as much as they be chief and springing of all other
synnys / Of the rote of these.vij. synnys is pride the general rote of all
harmis for of this rote springen certain braunchis as Ire / envy / accidye or
slouthe / avarice or couetyse to common understanding / glotonye / and lecherye
/ And euerich of thise sins has his braunchis and his twigges as shall be
declared in her chapitres following / And though so be that man knows not
utterly the nombre of the twiggis and of the harmys that comen of pride / yet
will I show a party of hem as ye shall understand / There is inobedience /
auauntyng / ypocrysye / despyte / arrogancye / Imprudence / swelling of h^rte /
Insolence / Elacion / pertynacye / veyn glory / And many other twiggis that I
can not declare / Inobedient is he that disobeieth for despite to the
com^andement of god and to his souereins and to his gostly fader / Auauntour is
he that auaunteth him of the harm or of the bounte that he has don Ipocrysye
is he that hides to show him such as he is. And shewith him to the pepl^ to
seem such as he is not. Dispitous is he that has disdaygn of his neighbor
that is to say of his even christian and has despyte to do that him ought to
do / Arrogaunt is he that thinks that he has that bounte in him that he has
not / or weneth that he should have hit by his desert / or ellis that he demeth
that he be that he is not / Imprudent is he that for his pride has no shame
for his sin / Swellyng of heart is when a man reioyseth him of harm that he
has done / Insolent is he that dispyseth in his Judgment all other folk as
to the regard of his value and of his connyng and of his spekyng and of his
beryng / Elate is he when he may neither suffer to have master ne fellow /
Impacient is he that will not be taught ne vndernome of his vices and by strif
warrith against truth wetyngly and defends his folly / Contumax is he that
thorugh his Indignacion is against every auctoryte or power of hem that been his
souereyns / Presumpcion is when a man takes an enpryse that him ought not to
do / or ellis he may it not do / And that is called Surquydry / Irreuerence is
when a man does not honor there as him ought to do and wayteth to be
reuerencyd / Pertynacy is when a man defends his folly and trusts to mykyl
to his owen wit / Veyn glory is for to have pomp and delight in temporel
highness and gloryfye him in wordly estates / Iangelyng is when a man spekith to
mykyl to forn folk and clappyth as a mylle and takes no keep what he says And
there is yet a pryue spyce of pride that wayteth first to be salewyd or ^e
salewe / al be he less worthy than that other is perauenture and eke he
wayteth to sytte or to goo above him in the weye or kiss pax or be sensyd or
go to offryng beforn his neighbor and such a proud desire to be magnified and
honored beforn the people / Now ben there two manners of pride that one of hem is
within the heart of man / And that other is without / Of which forsaid
things and moo than I have said apperteynen to the pride that is within the
heart of man / And there be also other spices of pride that be withouten. But
natheles one of these spices of pride is sign of that other / Right as the gay
leffel of tauernes is sign of the wyn that is in the seler / and this is in
many things as in speech in contenance in outrageousnes / of array of clotyng
Crist would not so sone have noted and spoken of the clothing of that rich man
in the gospel but if hit had be sin /. For as says saint Gregore / Precious
clothyng is culpable for the derthe of hit and for his strangenes / for his
disguysynges and for the superfluyte / or for the inordynate scantues / As to
the first sin that is in superfluyte of clothing / Which that makes it so
dear to harm of the people that only the cost of the enbrowding / the disgysing
endentyng / or barryng / oundyng / palyng and semblable wise of clothing in
vanyte / There is also costlew furryng in gowns / And also mykyl pounsyng of
chesell to make hool^s so mykyl daggyng of sherys with the superfluyte in
lenghte of the foresaid gownys traylyng in the dong and in the mire on horse and
eke on foot as well of man as of woman. that all that traylyng is verily as in
effect wasted / consumed / thredbare and roten with dong rather than it is
yeuen to the pour / to great damage of the forsaid pour folk and that in
s^ndry wise / this is to sayn the more that cloth is wastyd the more must it
cost for the scars^nes / And furtherouer yef they would give such pounsid and
daggis clothis to the pour folk / it is not conuenyent to were for her estate
ne sufficyent to her necessite / On that other side for to speak of the
disordinat scantnes of clothyng as ben these cutted sloppis or hanselynes that
through her shortness cover not the shameful membris of a man to wicked intent /
Allas som^e of hem shown in the shap and the boos of the horrible swollen
membris that semen like to the maladye of hirma in the wrappyng of her hosyn
and eke the ^uttokkis of hem behind that faren as it were the hinder part as a
she ape in the full of the moon / And more over the wrecchid swellyng membris
that they show in disgising in departing of her hosyn whit and read seems
that half the pryuy membris weren fleyn / And so by that they departen her
hosen in other colors as is whit and black / or whyt and blewe / or black and
reed and so forth / Than seems it as by varyance of color that half the part
of his preuy membris ben corupt by the fire of saint Antonye or by Canker / or
by other such myschaunces / yet of the hyndar part of her buttoks it is well
horrible for to see / For certes in that party of her body / there as they
purgen her stynkyng ordure / that foul party show they proudly to the people
in despit of honest / which honest that Ihesu Crist and his friends observed
to show in his life / Now as to outerageous array of woman / god wot though the
visage of ^em seem full chaste and debonair / yet notifyen they in their array of
attire / lichorousnes and pride / I say not that honest in clothyng of man
and woman is vncouenable / but certes the superfluyte or disordinat skarcete of
clothing is reprouable / Also the sin of ornement or in apparaill as in
things that apperteyne to ridyng / as in many delicat horses the beholden for
delight be cause they be so fair fat and costlewe / And also many a vicyous
knave maintenyd be cause of hem / And in curyous harneys as in sadels / cropers
/ peytrellis / and bridels couyrd with precious cloth and rich bars and
plates of gold and silver For which god says by Zachary the prophet / I will
confound the riders on such horsis / These folk taken lityl regard of riding
of gods sone and his harneys when he rood upon an ass and had non other
harneys but the clothis of his pour disciplis / Ne we read not the he rode
ever on any other best. I speak thus the of superfluyte / not for the honest
when reason it requires / And fertherouer certes pride is greatly notifyed in
holdyng of great meyne when they be of lityl p^^uffit / and namely when the
meyne is felenous and damage^us to the p^ple by hardynes of her lordship or by
wey of office / For certes such lordis sellyn her lordshipps to the devil of
^elle / when they sustain the wickedness of her meyne / or else when these folk
of low degree as they the holden hostelryes sustain theft by their hostelers
and that is in many manners of disc^ytes / such manner of folk b^n the flies the
folowen the honey Or else t^^ ^^undes that fol^wen the carein which forsaid folk
stra^g^^n spirituelly her lordship For which thus says david Wickedn^s m^t
come on the lorshipps / and god give that they mow^ des^en^^ d^un in to hell /
For in her houses is iniquyte and shreudnes and not go^ of heuyn / and certes
if thu do no mendement right as (...) his blessing to laban be cause of Jacob
and to pharao for the s^^^ise of ios^ph / right so will god ie^e his malison to
^uche lords that sustain the wickedness of her seruaunt^s But the common pride
of the table apperith eke full often For certes rich men be cleped to festis and
pour folk be put awey and rebuked / And there is excess of diuerce metes and
drynkes and namely of curyous manner of bakem^tis and of semblable wast so that
it is abusion for to think And eke in great precyousnes of vessel and
curiosite of mynystralcye by the which a man is styred more to the delytes of
luxurye / if so be that he set his heart the less upon our lord Ihesu Crist
certain it is a sin / And certes the delycate metis and the delight might be
so greet in the caas that men might the lightlyer fall by hem in to dedly
sin The spyces that sourden of pride / sothly is when they sourden of malice
ymagined and auised and forn cast or else of usage / been dedely synnys it is no
doubt / And when they sourden by freelte unadvised sodeinly / and suddenly
with^drawe again / al be they grievous synnys / I guess: suppose they be not
dedly / Now might men a^e whereof that pride sourdeth and spryngeth / And I say
that sometime it spryngeth of goods of nature / And sometime of the goods of
fortune / and some time of the goods of grace Cert^s the goods of nature
stonden in the goods of body o^ of soul Certes the goods of the body ben
^ele of body ^ s^renghte de^lyuernes / beauty / gentrye and fra^^nchises / The
goodis of nature of the soul ben / good wit with sharp understanding /
subtle engyn / virtue naturel ^ good memory ^ Goods of fortune ben riches /
high degrees of lordshippis and prey sing of the people / Goods of grace ben
science ^ power to ^uf^fre spirytuel trauayll / benignytees / virtuous
contemplaco^n Withstandyng of temptacion and semblable things. Of which
forsaid goods certes it is a great folly a man to pryden him in any of hem all
/ Now as for to speak of goods of nature god wot that some time we have them
in nature as much to our damage as to our prouffyt /. As for to speak of hele
of body certes it passith full lightly And eke it is full often thencheson of the
^ikenes of the soul For god wot the flesh is a full great enemy to the soul.
And therefore the more that a body is hool / the more be we in peril to fall /
Eke for to pride him in his strenghte of body it is a great folly / For certes
the flesh coueyteth against the spirit / And ever the more stronger the flesh
is / the soryer may the soul be / And over all this strength of the body and
wordly hardynes causes full oste many men to peril and mys^hance. Eke for to
pride him of his genterye / it is full great folly. For often time the genterye
of the body begins of the gentrye of the soul / And eke we be all of one
fader ^ ^f ^ne mother / And all we ben of one nature rotyn and corupt both
rich and pour / For sothe a manner gentrye is for to preyse that apparaylleth
man's courage with vertu^s or moralyte^s and maki^h him a Christian child. For
trust^th well that what man that sin has over maistryd is very cho^le to
sin / Now ben there three general things of gentilnes as eschewyng of vicys or
rybaudrye And seruage of sin in word and werk in contenance And vsyng v^rtu
as cou^tesye / clennesse and to be liberal that is to say large by mesure. For
that that passith mesure is folly and sin / Another is that he remember him
of the bounte that he of other folk has resseyuyd / Another And is to be
benygne over his ^ubgette / werfore as says Seneke / There is nothing more
couenable to man of high estate that debonayrte / And these flies that men
clepen Bees when they make her king / they chesen one that has non prykke
wherewith he may stynge / Another is a man to have a noble heart and a diligent
tatteyne to hye virtuous things / Certes also who that prydeth in the goodis
of fortune he is full like a great fool / For sometime a man is a full great man
by the morrow / that is a wrecche or a caytyf or it be night / And sometime
delytes of man ben cause of grievous maladye thorugh which he deyeth / Certes
the commendacion of the people is sometime full falls and full brotyl for to trust
This day they preyse / to morrow they blame / god woot / Eke desire to have
comendacion of the people has cau / sed death to many a man Now certes a man to
pride him in the goodis of grace is eke an outrageous folly for the yeftes of
grace that should have turned him to goodness and to medecyne tornyth to venym
and to confusion / as says saint Gregore / Now since that so is that ye have
understand what is pride and which ben the spicis of hit / and how mennys
pride sourdeth and spryngith / Now shall ye under ande which is the remedy
against pride / And th^^ is humylyte or mekenes / That is a virtue through which
man has very knowleche of him self and holds of him self no deynte ne no
price as in regard of his deserts considering ever his freelte / Now ben there
three manners of humylyte / as humylyte in heart / and another in the mouth and
the third in werkis / The humylite in heart is in four man^rs that is when a
man holds him self as naught worth before god of heuyn / Another is when he
d^spiseth none other man The third is / that ^e reckith not though men hold
him naught / The fourth is when he is not sorry of his humiliacion / Also the
humyliacion of mouth is in four things. In attemperat speech / And when he
knows with his owen mouth that he is such as he thinks that he is in his
^erte / Another when he preiseth the debonairte of another man And also nothing
thereof amenusith / Humylite eke in werkis is in four manners / The first is
when he put men before him / The secon^ is to chese the lowest place / The.iij.
is gladly to assente to good counceyl / The.iiij. is gladly to stand in
obedience of his souereyn or of him that is higher in degree / Certes that is a
great werk of humylite.

Sequitur de Inuidia.
AFter pride will I speak of the foul sin of envy. which that is as by the
word of the philosophre sorrow of other mennys prouffit / And after the word of
saint Austyn it is sorrow of other men's well and Joy of other mennys harm /
This foul sin is platly against the holy ghost / Al be it so that every sin
is against the holy ghost. Yet for as muc^e as b^unte apperteyneth to the holy
ghost properly / And envy comes properly of malice / Therefore it is properly
against the bounte of the holy ghost / Now has malice two spices that is to say
hardynes of heart and wickedness / or ellis the flesh of man is so blind that
he consyderyth not that he is in sin / which is the hardynes of the devil /
That other spyce of envy is when a man warrith ay^nst truth when that he
woot that it is troth / And eke when that he warrith the grace that god has
give to his neyghebour / And all this by envy / certes than is envy the werst
sin that is / For sothly all other synnys be some time against one specyal
virtue / But certes envy is against all manner virtues and all goodness / for it
is sorry of al bounte of his neighbors / And in this manner it is dyuerce from
al synnys / For uneath is there any sin that it ne has some delight in him
self save only envy that ever has in him self anguysh and sorrow / The spices
of envy ben these / There is first sorrow of other men's goodness / And of her
prosperyte ought to be kyndely matter of Joy / Thanne is envy a sin against
kind / The second spice of envy is joy of other men's harm / Of this second
spice comes bakbytyng or detraction that has two spicis as thus / Some men
preyse her neighbor by wicked intent For he makes always awicked knotie at
last end always he makes a but that is sign of more blame than worth is all the preysing / The second spice is that a man be good and do and say a thing
to good intent / The bacbitar will torn all the goodness up so down to his shrewd
intent The third is to a^emise the bounte of his neighbor / The fourth spice
of bacbityng is this that if men speak goodness of a man / the bacbitar will say
/ perfay yet is such a man better than he / in dispreysing of him that men
preyse / The fyfthe is to consent gladly to herkne the harm that men speken of
other folk / this sin is full great and ay ^^cresith after the wicked intent
of the bacbiter / After bacbytyng comyth grucchyng or murmurance / And sometime
it spryngeth of Impacience against god and sometime ayens^ man / Against god is
when a man grucchyth agayns^ the pain of hell / or against pouerte or loss of
catel or against rayn or tempest / or else gru^^heth that shrewis have prosperyte
/ or ellis that good men have aduersite / And all these things should men
suffer patiently / For they common by the rightful Judgment and ordynance of god
/ Som^e time comith gru^chyng of avarice as Judas gru^ched against Magdaleyn
when she anointed the head of our lord Ihesu Crist with her precious oynement /
This manner of murmur is such as when men gru^^hen of goodness / of that men hem
self done / or that other folk done of her owen catel / Sometime comith murmur
of pride as when Simon the pharise gru^chid against Magdaleyn when she approchid
to Ihesu Crist / And wept at his feet for her synnys / And sometime it sourdeth
of envy when men discoueren a man's harm that was pryue or berith him on hand
thing that is false / Murmur is eke often among seruan^tes when her souereyns
bidden hem do lefful thingis / And for as much as they dar not openly withsaye
the commandment of her master / yet will they say harm and gru^^he and
murmr privily for very dispite / which words men clepe the deuylles pater
noster / though so be the devil had never pater noster / but that folk give
such a name / sometime it comes of ire or of pryue hate the norissheth rancour
in heart as after I shall declare Th^nne comes eke bitterness of heart Through
which bitterness every good deed of his neighbor semyth to him bitter and
v^nsauory / Than comes discord that vnbindeth al manner of friendship / Then
comes scornyng of his neighbor al do he never so well / then comes accusing
as when men sekin occasion to annoye his neighbor / which that is like the
craft of the devil tht wayteth both night and day to accusen us all / Then
comes malignyte through which a man noyeth his neighbor pryuely if he may /
And if he naught may algate his wicked will shall not want as for to brenne his
house pryuely or empoysen him or sle his bestis and semblable thingis / Now will
I speak of the remedy of this foul sin of envy / The first is the love of
god principally and loving of him self and of his neighbor / For sothly that
one may not be without that other / And Crist will in the name of thy neighbor
that thou shall understand thy brother / For certes all we have one fader
fleshly and one mother that is to say Adam and Eve / And eke one fader
spirytuel that is to say god of heaven / Thy neighbor art thou hold for to
love and will him al goodness / And therefore says god / love thy neighbor as
thy self that is to say to life and to soul and salvation / And more over thou
shall love him in word and benign chere and monysshyng and chastisyng in a
voys to comfort him and pray for him with all thy heart / And in deed thou
shall love him in such wise that thou shall do to him in charity as thou
would were done to thyn owen person / And therefore thou shall do to him no
damage in wicked word ne harm in his body ne in his catel ne in his soul by
entysyng of wicked ensample / Thou shall not desire his wife ne none of his
thingis / Understand eke that in the name of thy neighbor is comprehendid his
enemy Certes a man shall love his enemy for the commandment of god / And sothly
thy friend shall thou love in god / I say thyn enemy shall thou love for gods
sake by his commandment / For it were reason a man should hate his enemy / For
soth god wol not receive us to his love that been his enemies / Against three
manner wrongis that his enemy does to him he shall do three thingis as thus /
against hate and rancour of heart he shall love him in heart / against chyding and
wicked words he shall pray for his enemy / against the wicked deed of his
enemy he shall do him bounte. For Crist says loves your enemies and prays
for hem that spekith you harm and eke for hem that you chasen and poursuen and
do bounte to hem that you haten / Lo thus comaundeth us our lord Ihesu Crist to
do to our enemies For soth nature dryueth us to love our friends / And parfey
our enemies have more need to love than our friends / And they that more need
have / Certes to hem shall we do goodness / and certes in that deed have
remembrance of the love of Ihesu Crist that deyde for his enemies / And for as
much as that love is the more grievous to perform / so much is more greet
the merit / And therefore the loving of our enemy has confounded the venym of
the devil / For right as the devil is scomfyted by hum^lyte / Right so is he
wounded to the death by the love of our enemy / Certis than is love medicyn
that chac^th out the venym of envy fro mannys heart.

Sequitur de Ira.
AFter envy wol I declare of the sin of Ire Forsooth he that has envy upon
his neighbor / anon comynly will find him matter of wrath in word or in deed /
against him to whom he has envy for sothly he that is proud or enuyous is
lightly wroth / This sin of Ire after discriuyng of saint Austyn is wickid
will to be auengid by word or by deed / Ire after the philosopher is the
fervent blood of man y quyckend in his heart / through which he will harm to
him that he hates / For certes the her^e of man by enchafyng and meuyng of his
blood wexeth so trobled that he is out of al Judgment of resons / But ye shul
understand that Ire is in two manners / Oon of hem is good and that other is
wicked / The good Ire is by Ielousye of goodness thorugh the which a man is
wroth with wickedness and against wickedness / And therefore says the wyseman
that Ire is better than play / This Ire is with debonayrte and it is wrath
without bitterness. not wroth against the man / but wroth with the mysdede of
the man as says the prophet / Irascimim et noli^e peccare Now understand that
wicked Ire is in two manners that is to say sodeyn Ire or hasty Ire without
auisement and consentyng of his reason / The menyng and the sense of this / is
that reason of a man ne consents not to that sodeyn Ire / and than is it
venyal / Another Ire is that is full wickid that comes of felonye of heart
auysed and cast before with wicked will to do vengeance / and thereto his reason
consentith and sothly this is dedely sin / This Ire is so displaysaunt to god
that it troublyth his house and chacyth the holy ghost out of mannys soul and
put in him the sekenes of the devil and benymeth the man fro god that is his
rightful lord / This Ire is a full great ple^saunce to the devil for it is the
deuillis furneys that he enchaunsith with the fire of hell / For certes as
fire is more mighty to destroy erthly thingis than another element / Right so
ire is mighty to destroy al spirituel thingis Look how that fire of small
gledis that be almost deed under asshen will quycken again when they be touchid
with bremstom / Right so Ire will ever more quycken again when it is touchid
with pride that is coueryd in mannys heart / For certes fire may not come out
of nothing but if hit were first in the same thing naturelly as fire is drawn
out of flyntis with steel / Right so is pride a matter of Ire / right as rancour
is norissher and kepar thereof / There is a manner tree as says saint Isodore /
That when men make fire of that tree and cover the colis of hit with asshen /
Sothly the fire thereof wol last al a year or more / And right so farith it by
rancour / When he is ones conseyned in the hertes of sum men / Certis it will
last perauenture from one ester day Till an other or more / But certes that man
is full far from the mercy of god all that while / In this forsaid deuylles
forneys they forgen three shrewis / Pride than blows and encreceth the fire by
chydyng and wicked words Then stont envy and holds the iron upon the
hertes of men / With a payr of long tongues with long rancour / And then stont
the sin of contynuel stryf and cheest and betith and forgith the vilayns
reprouynges. Certes this cursid sin anoieth both the man him self and eke his
neighbor For sothly almost all the harm that any man does to his neighbor
comes of wrath. For certes outrageous wrath does all that ever the devil
comandeth him. For he sparith neither for Crist ne his sweet mother in his
outrageous anger and Ire but spekith and sklaundrith his neighbor / this is a
cursid life which life should be debonayr and spyrytuel that should keep his
soul. Certes this Ire or wrath bynymeth eke goddis due lordship and that is
man's soul and the love of his neighbors / hit stryueth always eke against
truth / hit reueth him the quyete of his heart and ^ubuertith his soul / Of
ire common these stynkyng engendruris / First hate that is old wrath renewid /
through which a man forsakes his owen friend that he has louyd so long / And
then comyth werre and every manner of wrong that a man does to his neighbor
in body or in Catel / Of this cursid sin of Ire comes eke manslaghter / And
understands well that manslaghter is in diverse wise / Som^e manner of
manslaughter is spirytuel / And som^e bodily / Spirytuel manslaghter is in six
thingis. / First by hate as says s^ynt John / he that hates his brother is an
homicyde / Manslaghter is eke by bacbytyng of which bacbitours says Salamon
that they have two swerdis with which they sle her neighbors / For sothly as
wickid it is to benyme his good name as his life / homicyde is eke in yeuyng of
wicked counceyl by fraud / or for to give counceyl for to areyse wrongful
custom^s and talagis of which speaks Salamon / Lion roryng and bear hungry
ben likenyd to cruel lordis / in withholdyng or abeeggyng of the hyre or wagis
of pour folk / For which the wyseman says. / Feed ye him that almost deyeth
for hunger / For sothly but if thou feed him thou sleest him / And al these ben
dedely synnys / Bodily manslaughter is when thou sleest him with thy tunge /
Another manner is when thou comandest to sle a man / or ellis yeuyst him
counceyl to sle a man Manslaughter in deed is in four manners / That one is by
law / right as a Iustyse dampneth him that is culpable to the death / but let
the Iustyse bewaar that he do it rightfully And that he do it not for delight to
spylle blood but for keeping of rightwisnes / Another homicyde is don for
necessyte as when a man sleeth another his defendaunt and that he ne may other
wise escape fro his owen death. But certain and he may escape without slaughter
of his aduersarye and sleeth him he does sin / and he shall bear penance as
for dedely sin / Eek if a man by caas or adventure shete an arowe or cast a
stoon with which he sleeth a man it is homicyde / Eke if a woman by neclygence
over lies her child in slepyng / it is homicyde and dedely sin / Eke when a
man destroys concepcion of a child or makyth a woman bareyne by drynkes of
venymous herbis through which she may not conceive Or sleeth her child by
drynkis / or ellis puts certain materyal thing in her secret place to sle
her child / or ellis does unkind sin / by which man or woman shedeth his
nature in place there as a child may not be conceived / or ellis if a woman have
conceived and hurt her self and sleeth her child / yet is it homicyde / What
say we eke of women that murdren her children for dread of worldly shame
Certes it is eke an horrible homycyde Eke if a man approach to a woman by
desire of lecherye through which the child is perysshed else smyteth a woman
wetyngly by which her child is slain / All these ben homycydes and dedely
horrible synnys / yet common of Ire many mo synnys as In word in thought in deed
as well as he that aretteth upon god or blasphemyth god of which he is him self
gilty or dispiseth god and all his halowis as don these cursid hasourdours in
diverse contrees / This cursed sin do they when they felen in her heart full
wickedly of god and his halowis / Also when they tretyn unworthily the
sacrament of the awter / Thilk sin is so great / that uneath may it be
relecyd but that the mercy of god passyth his werkis / which mercy is great
and benygne / There comes also of Ire a tery anger When a man is sharply
amonesshed in his shryfte to forlete his sin / Than will he be angry and
answer ^okirly and angerly to defend or excusyn his sin / by unsteadfastness
of his flesh / or ellis he did hit for to hold company with his felaws / or
ellis he says / the fend entised him. or ellis he did hit for his yongth /
or else his comple^ion is so corageous that he may not forbere / ellis it is
des^yne as he says unto a certain age / or ellis he says it comyth him of
gentilnes of his auncetryes and semblable thingis All these manner of folk so
wrappen hem in her synnys that they will not deliver hem self / For sothly no
wight that excusith him wilfully of his sin / may be deliuerd of his sin /
til he mekely beknoweth his sin / After then comes sweryng that is expres
against the commandment of god and this befallyth of anger and of Ire. God
says thou shall not take the name of thy lord in ydil / Also our lord Ihesu
Crist says by the word of saint matthew / ne will ye to swear in all manner /
neither by heaven for hit is goddis Trone / neither by earth for it is the
benche of his feet / ne by Iherusalem / for it is the Cite of a great king /
ne by thyn head / for thou ne may make an here white ne black / but your oath
shall be ye / ye / nay / nay. And what that is more evil / thus says Crist For
cristes sake swear ye not so synfully in dismembryng of Crist. by soul / heart
/ bonys / and body. For ye think that the cursid Iewis dismembrid him not
ynowh but ye dismembre him more / And if so be the law compelle you to swear
then rewle you after the law of god in your sweryng As says saint Iherome
the.iiij. chapitre Thou shall keep three conditions Thou shall swear in troth /
in dome / and in rightwisnes This is to say thou shall swear soth For every
lesing is against Crist / for crist is very truth / And think well this that
every great swerer not compellid lawfully to swear the plaghe of vengeance shall
not part from his house whiles he uses such unlawful swering Thou shall ^ke
swear in dome whenne thou art compellid by thy domes man to witness the
truth / Eke thou shall not swear for envy / for favor / for mede / but for
rightwisnes for declaring of troth to the worship of god and to helpyng of
thyn even christian / And therefore every man that takes gods name in idle or
falsely swerith with his mouth / or ellis takes on him the name of Crist to be
a callid a Christian man and lives against christian living and his teching / all
they take goddis name in idle / Look eke what says saint Petir Actuum quarto /
There is none other name under heaven yeuen to man in which they moot be sauyd /
That is to say but in the name of Ihesu Crist / Take keep eke hou that
precious name of Ihesu Crist As says saint Poule at philipenses etc In nomine
Ihesu etc / That in the name of Ihesu every kne of heavenly creature or erthely
or of hell should howen. For hit is so high and so worshipful that the corsid
fend in hell should tremble for to here it named / Than seems it that men
that swear so horribly his blessid name that they despise it more boldly than
did the cursid Iewys that tremeleden when they herd his name / Now certes fith
that sweryng but it be do al lawfully is so hoolly defended much werse is for
to swear falsely and eke nedeles / what say we eke of them that delyten them
in sweryng and hold it a gentrye or manly deed to swear great othis / And what
of hem that of very usage ne cesse not to swear great oaths /. All the cause not
worth a straw / Cer^es this is horrible. sin / Sweryng also without
auisement is eek sin. But late us goo now to that cursid and horrible swering
of adiuracion and coniuracion as don these falls enchauntours and nygromancers
in basyns full of water / or in a bright swerd / in a cercle or in a fire / or
in a sholdre boon of a sheep I can not say but they do cursidly and dampnably
against Crist and all the faith of holy church / what say by them that bileuyn
in dym naylis as by flight or by noise of birdis and of beestis or by sort /
by nygromancye / by dremes By chirchyng of dooris by gnawyng of rattis or
crakyng of housis and such manner of wrecchidnes / Certis all this thing is
defendid by god and eke holy church / for which they be cursid til they come
to amendment / that on such fylthe set their believe / Charmys for woundis
and maladyes of men or of bestis / if they take any effect / it may be
perauenture that god fussreth it / for men should give the more feith and
reverence to his name / Now will I speak of lesynges which generally is false
significacion of word with intent to disceyue his even Christian / Some lesing
there is of which comes none advantage to no wight / And some lesing torneth to
the ese and prouffit of a man and to damage of another man / Another lesing for
to save his lif or ca^el / Another lesing comyth of delight / They will forge a
long tale and peynte it with all circumstancis whereof all the ground is false /
Som^e lesing comyth for he will ^usteyne his word / And som^e lesing comyth of
rechelisnes withouten auysement and semblable thingis / Let us now towche the
vice of flaterye / which comyth not gladly but for dread or for couetyse.
Flaterye is generally wrongful praising / Flaterers ben the deuillis norices
that norissh his children with the mylk of losengery / For soth says Salamon
that flaterye is worse than detraction. For sometime detraction makith an
hau^teyn man be the more humble for he dredeth detraction / But certain
flaterye makes a man to enhaunce his heart and his contenaunce / Flaterers ben
the deuilles enchan^tours f^r they maken a man to wenyn him self be like / that
he is not like / They be like Judas that betrayed god / And these flaterers
betraye a man to selle him to his enemy that is the devil / Flaterers ben the
deiullis c^apelleyns that syngen ever placebo / I rekene flaterye in vicis of
ire / For often time if a man be wroth with another Then will he flatere some
wight to sustene him in his quarrel / Speak we now of such cursing as comith
out of yrous hertes / Malison may be said generally every manner power of harm /
such cursyng bereueth a man the regne of god As says saint Paul / And often
such cursyng wrongfully retorneth again to him that cursyth / As a bird
retorneth again to his owen neste / And over all thing men ought teschewe to
curse her children and to give to the devil her engendrure as ferforth as in
hem is / Certis it is a great paryl and a great sin / Let us then speak of
chydyng and repreuyng which ben great woundis in mannys heart / for certes
uneath may a man be plainly accorded with him that he has openly reuylyd /
reprouyd and disclaundrid this is a full grisly sin / as Crist says in the
gospel / And take ye keep now that he that reprouith his neighbor by some harm
or by som^e pain that he has in his body / as mesil / crooked harlote / or by
sum sign that he does / Now if he repreuyth him by harm of pain / then
retorneth the repref to Ihesu Crist / For pain is sent by the ryghtwys sonde
of god and by his suffraunce / be it meselerye or mayme or maladye / And if be
repreue him uncharitably of sin / thou ^^lour / thou dronkelew harl^t and so
forth then apperteyneth it to reioysyng of the devil that ever has joy that
men don sin / And certes chydyng may not come but of vilens heart / For after
haboundaunce of the heart speaks the mouth full often / And ye shul understand
when any man chastises another that he be waar fro chidyng or repreuyng / For
trewly but he be waar he may full lightly quycken the fire of anger and of wrath
which that ^e shall not quench / and perauenture sleeth him that he might
chastyse with benignyte. For as says Salamon / The amyable tongue is the tree of
life that is to say of life spir^tuel / And a dislaue tongue sleeth the spirytis
of him that is reprouyd / Lo what says saint Austyn / There is no thing like
the deuyllis child as ^e that often chideth / Saint Poule says eek / I
servant of god behoue not to chide / And how that chiding is avileyns thing
betwixt all manner folk / yet is hit certes most vncouenable betwix a man and
his wife / For there is never rest / And therefore says Salamon / An house that
is vncouerd in rayn and droppyng / and a chiding wife be like a man that is in a
droppyng house in many placis / though he eschew the droppyng in one place / hit
droppeth on him in another place / So farith it by a chyding wife but she chide
him in one place she will chyde him in another place /. And therefore better is a
morsel breed with joy / than an house full of delytes with chydyng / Lo what
Salamon and saint Paul sayn / O ye women be ye subgettis to ^our husbondis as
behooves in god /. And ye men ^^ue ^our wyuys /. A^terward speak we of scornyng
wh^c^e is a wicked sin and namely when he scornyth a man b^ his good werkis
/. For certes such scorners faren like t^^ ^oule tode that may not endure to
smelle the sweet savor of the vine when it florisshith / These scorners ben
partyng f^laws with the devil for they have joy when the devil wym^eth and
sorrow when he lesith. They be adversaries to Ihesu Crist For they haten that he
l^ueth that is to say sauacion of soul /. Speak we now of the wicked counceyl
For he that wicked counceyl y^uyth is a treytour. For he disceyueth him that
trusts in ^ym /. But natheles yet is wicked counceyl first (...) him self /
For as says the wise man. Every f^ls living h^th his properte in him self. For
he that will anoye another man anoi^th first him self. And men shall understand
that a man shall not tak^ his counceyl of false folk ne of angry folk or grievous
folk ne of folk that louen specially to much her owen prouffyt / ne to much
wordly folk and namely in councelyng of fo^lis / Now comyth the sin of hem
that maken discord among folk / Which is a sin that Crist hates utterly /
And no wonder is / for he deyde for to make concord / And more shame don they
to Crist than did they that him Crucyfyed For god loves better that friendship
be among folk than he did his owen body which he yaf for unity / Therefore be
they likenyd to the devil that ever is about to make discord / Now comyth the
sin of double tunge ^uche as speak fair beforn men and wickedly behind / or
ellis they make semblan^t as though they speken of good entencion / or ellis in
game and pley / and they speken of wicked entente. Now comyth the wreyyng of
counseil / through which man is defamed / vnnethis may he restore the damage /
Now comyth manace that is an open folly / For he that openly menaceth he
threteneth more than he may overcome full of^e time / Now comen idle wordis that
be without prouffit of him that speaks the words and eke of him that
h^rkenyth the words / Or ellis idle words ben tho that been nedeles or
without intent of naturel prouffit / And al be hit that idle words be sometime
venyal sin / yet shall men doubt hem / For we shall give rekenyng of hem
before god / Now comyth Iangeling that may not come without sin as faith
Salamon / it is a sign of appert folly And therefore a philosopher said when a
man axid him how men should plese / And he answerde do many good werkis and
speak few Iangelyngis / After this comes the the sin of Iapers that been the
deuillis apis For they make folk to laughe at her Iaperye / as folk done at
gawdes of an ape Such Iapis defends saint Poule Look how that virtuous
words and holy conforten hem that trauaylen in the seruise of Crist / right so
comforten the vileyns words and the knackis of Iapers hem that trauaylen in
the seruise of the devil All these ben the synnys of the tunge that common of
Ire and of other synnys. The remedy against Ire is a virtue that clepen
man^uctude that is debonairte / and eke another virtue that men cl^pen patience
/ Saint Iherome says thus of d^bonairte that it does harm to no wight ne says
none harm that men him do ne seyn ne changes not against reason This virtue
comes sometime of nature For as says the philosopher a man is a quyk thing by
nature debonair and tretable by goodness But when debonarete is enfourmed of
grace it is the more worthy / Patience is another remedy against ire and is a
virtue the men suffer suetely every man's goodness / and is not wroth for none
harm the is done to him / The philosopher says / that patience is that virtue
that suffers debonarrly al the outrage of aduersite / and every wicked word /
This virtue makes a man like to god and makes him his owen dear child. as
says crist this virtue disco^fiteth thin enemy And therefore says the wise m^n
if thou wolt vemquyshe thin enemy see the thou be paciente / Suffran^ce is
another virtue against Ire / and that is when h^ suf^reth swetly all anoyance
and the wrongis that men do a man outward / Thou shall understand that a man
suffers (...) manner of greuan^cis in outward thingis Against which four he
must have f^ure manner of patience. The first greuance is wickid words / that
greua^nce suffryd Ihesu Crist without grucchyng well patiently when the Jews
despised him and reproved him full often / Suffer thou therefore patiently / for
the wise man says if thou strive with a fool / if the fool be wroth or though
he laughe Algate thou shall have no rest That other greuance outward is to
have damage of thy Catel / There against ^uffryd Crist full patiently when he
dispoylid was of all that ever he had in this life and that nas but clothis /
The third greuance is to a man to have greuance in his body / that suffryd
Crist full patiently in all his passion / The fourth greuance is in outrageous
labor in werkis / Wherefore I say that folk the maken her servants to
travail to grievously out of time as in holy days / sothly they do great sin
/ ^ere against suffered christ full patiently and taught us patience when he bare
upon his blessid sholdres the cross upon which he should suffer despitous death
/ here may men learn to be pacient / For certes not only christian men be pacie^t
for the love of Ihesu Crist and for guerdon of the bliss of heaven and of the
blessed life that is perdurable / But certes the old paynems that neu^r were
crystend comendid and used the virtue of patience / A philosophre upon a time
that would have beten his disciple for his great trespaas ^ for which he was
greatly ame^yd and brought a yerd to scourge the child / And when the child saw
the yerd he said to his master / what will ye do / I will beat the quod the
master for thy correction / For soth quod the child ye ought first correct
your self that have lost your patience for the gilt of a child / For soth said
the master al weeping thou say soth have thou the yerd my dear sone and
correct me for mine vnpacience / Of patience comith obedience through which a
man is obedyent to Crist and to all hem to which he ought to be obedyent in
Crist / And understand well that obedyence is parfight when men do gladly and
hastily with good heart entierly all that he should do / Obedyence generally is
to perform the doctrine of god and to his souereyns to which him ought to be
obeyssant in all rightwysnes.

Sequitur de Accidia.
AFter the sin of wrath I will speak of the sin of accidye or sloth. For
envy blyndeth the heart of man / And Ire trobleth a man / And accidye makes
him (...) thoughtful and wrawe / Envy and Ire maken bitterness in heart /
which bi^ternes is mother of accidye and benymeth him the love of al goodness /
then is accidye the anger of a troble heart / And saint Austyn says It is
annoye of goodness and annoye of harm / Certes this is a dampnable sin. For it
does wrong to Ihesu Crist in as much as he benymeth the seruise that men
ought to do to Ihesu Crist with all diligence As says Salamon / But accidye
does none such diligence / He does all with annoye and wrawnes Slaknes /
excusacion / dulnes and unlust. Forwhiche the book says a cursid be he that
does the seruise of god necligently. th^nne is accidye enemy to every estate
of man For the estate of man is in iij. manners / Either it is estate of
Innocence as was the state of adam before or that he fyl in to sin inwhich
estate he was hold to worche as in heriing and adouring of god Another estate
is estate of supfluyte / Inwhiche estate men be holden to labor in prayng to
god for amendment of her synnys / Another estate is in the estate of grace /
In which estate is he holden to do werkis of penytence / And certes to all
these thingis is accidye enemy and contrar^ for he loves no besynes at all /
Now certes this foul sin of accidye is eke a full great enemy to the liuelod
of the body For it has no purueance against temporel necessite / For it is
slouthyd and forsloggid and destroys al goods temporel by rechelisnes / The
fourth thing is that accidye is like hem that been in the pain of hell be
cause of slouthe ^ of her heaviness / For they that be dampened be so bound that
neither may they do well ne think well / Of accidye comes first that a man is
anoyd and encombrid to do any goodne^ and makes that god has abhominacion of
such accid^e as says saint John / Now comes slouthe that will suffer no
hardness ne no penance / For soth sloth is so delicate and so tender as says
Salamon that he will suffer non hardness ne penance and therefore he shendeth all that ^e death Against this rotyn horyd sin of accidye or slouthe should men
excercyse hem to do good werkis and manly and virtuously cacchen courage well to
do / Thynkyng that our lord Ihesu Crist quytith every good deed be it never so
litil Usage of it is a great thing / For it makyth as says saint Bernard the
laborer to have strong armies and hard synewis / and sloth makith hem feeble
and tender Than comyth dread for to begin to work any good werkis / For
certes he that is inclined to sin him thinks it is to great an empryse for
to undertake to do werki^ of goodness as says saint Gregore / Now comyth
wanhope that is despair of the mercy of god that comyth sometime of to much
outrageous sorrow and sometime of mykyl dread ymagenyng that he has do so much
that it would not auaylle him though he would repent him and do good. through
which dispeyr or dread / He haboundeth his heart to every manner sin As says
saint Austyn / Which that is dampnalle if it continue to his end / hit is
cleped synnyng in the holy ghost / This horrible sin is so perylous that he
that is dispeyred that there is no felonye ne no sin that he doubtyth for to
do as showed well by Judas / ^ertes then abouen all is this sin most
displaysaunt and most adversary to Crist / Certes he that dispeyreth is like
the coward champyon recreaunt and nedel^s dispeyreth / For certes the mercy of
god is ever ready to the penitent / hit is a boue al his werkis / Alas can not a
man bethynke him on the gospel of saint luke / Luce xv^ Where as Crist says
that as well shall there be more joy in heaven upon a sinful man that does
penitence than upon nyenti and nine rightful men that neden no penitence / look
ferther in the gospel the joy and the feestis of the good man that h^d lost
his sone / when his sone with repentance was returned to his fa^er / Can they
not remember eke as says saint luke xxiij^. How that the thief that was honged
beside Ih^su / Said lord rememb^e on me when thou come to thy regne /
forsooth said Crist / this day shall thou be with me in paradys / Certes the^ is
none so horrible sin of man that it ne may in his l^f be distroied by
penitence through virtue of the passion of Crist / Alas what needs man th^nne to
be dispey red sithen his mercy is so ready / ask and have / Then comes
sompnolence that is sluggy slumbryng which makith a man to be heavy and dull in
body and in soul / And this sin comyth of slouthe / And certes the time as
by weye of reason men should not sleep that is by the morrow but if it were cause
reasonable / For sothe in the morrow is most couenable a man to say his prayers
and for to think on god and to honor god and to give alms to the pour that
first comen in the name of Crist / Lo what Salamon says / who so will by the
morrow a wake to seek me he shall find me / Then comes negligence or
rechelesnes that re^kith of no thing / And how that ignorance is mother of all
harm / Certes negligence is the norice / negligence does no forswhan he shall
do a thing whether he do it well or badly Of the remedy of these two synnys as
says the wiseman that he that dredeth god sparith not to do that him ought to
do / and he that louyth god will do diligence to plese god by his werkis and
habounden him self with all his might well for to do / Then comyth ydlenes
that (...) the yate of all harmys an idle man is like to a place that has no
wallis the devil may enter on every side / This ydlenes is the thurrok of all
vilayns and wickid thought^s and of all Ianglis / tryflis and al ordure /
Certes heaven is yeuen to hem that will labor and not to idle men / Eke david
says / That they be not in the labor of men ne they shall not be whipped with
men that is to say in purgatory. Certes then semyth it they shall be
to^mentid with the devil in hell / but if they do penytence / Then comyth
the sin that men clepe tarditas as when a man it so lettyd and so tarried or
he will turn to god and certes that is a great folly / he is like him that
fallith in the diche and will not arise / And this vice comyth of falls hope that
he thinks that he shall live long but that hope faylleth full often / Then
comyth laches that is he that when he begins any good werk anon he will
forlete hit and stynte as do they that have any wight to govern and take of
him no keep / Anon as they find any contrary or any anoye / These ben the
new shepherdes that leten her sheep wytyngly go run to the wolf that is in
the breris and do no force of her owen governance / Of this comyth pouerte and
destruction both of spirytuel and temporel thingis. Then comes a manner of
coldness that fresith all the heart of man / Then comyth vndeuocion through
which a man is so blont As says saint Bernard and has such lang^ur in his
soul that he ne may read ne sing in holy church ne here ne think of
devotion ne trauaylle with his hondes in no good work but it is to him
unsavory and al apallid then wexith he sore sluggish and slumbry and soon will
he be wroth and soon is enclyned to hate and to envy / And then comyth the
sin of worldly sorrow / that is cleped Tristicia / that sleeth a man as s^ith
saint paul / For certes such sorrow werkith to the death of the soul and of
the body also. For thereof comyth that a man is anoyed of his owen lif for such
sorrow shortith the lif of many a man or that his time come by way of kind
Against this h^rryble sin of accidye and the braunchis of the same there is a
virtue that is callid fortitudo or strength that is aff^ctyon through which man
dyspyseth al other thyngis noyous /. This virtue is so mighty and so vigorous
that it dar withstand myghtily and wrestle against the sawtes of the devil and
wisely keep him self fro perils that been wicked / For it enhaunsith and
enforsith the soul / right as accidye abatith it and makes it feeble For this
fortitudo may endure with long suffran^ce the traueyllis that been couenable /
This virtue has many spicis the first is clepid magnanymyte that is to say
great courage / For certes there behooves great courage against ac^idye leest that
it swalowe the soul by the sin of sorrow or distroye it with wanhope / This
makes folk to undertake hard and grievous thingis by her owen will wisely and
resonably / And for as much as the devil fightith against man more by queyntyse
and by sleyght than by strength therefore a man shall withstand him by wit by
reason and by discrecion / Then ben there the virtues of feyth and hope in god
and in his saintis to achyeuen and complisshe the good werkis in which he
purposith fermly to cont^nue. Th^nne comes sewrte and sikernesse / and that is
when a man does and perfourmeth great werkis of goodness that he has begun /
And that is the end why men should do go^d werkis / For in the complisshyng of
good werkis lies the great guerdon / Then is the constance that is stablenes
of courage / and this should be in heart by steadfast feyth and in mouth and in
beryng / in chere and in deed Eke there ben mo special thingis and remedies
against accidye in diverse werkis and in consideracion of the pain of hell and
of the joy of heaven / And in t^ust of the grace of the holy ghost that will
give him might to perform his intent

.Sequitur de Auaricia.
AFter accidye now will I speak of auaryce and of couetyse of which sin says
saint Poule / The rote of all sin is couetyse. For sothly when the heart of
a man is confounded in hit self and troblid and that the soul has lost the
comfort of god. Then seeks ^e an idle solas of w^^ldy thingis ^ Auaryce
after descripcion of saint Austyn is a lichorousnes in heart to have erthely
thingis / Som^e other folk say that auaryce is for to purchase many erthly
thyngis ^ and nothing give to hem that have need / And understand well that
auaryce is not oonly in good and ^n catel / but ^umtyme in science and in
glory and in every outrageous thingis is avarice ^ couetyse / And the
difference bitwene avarice and couetyse is this / Couetyse ^s for to cou^yte
such thingis as thou have not / and avarice is to witholde and to keep such
thingis as thou have without rightful need ^ Sothl^ this auar^ce is a sin
full dampnable for all holy wryt cursith hit and speaks against hit for it does
wrong to Ih^su Crist. For hit bereuyth fro him the love that men to him owen
and torneth hit bacward against al reason and makyth that the auarous man has
more hope in his catel than in I^^su Crist. And therefore says saint Paul /
that an au^rous m^n has more h^pe in his thraldom of ydolatrye than in god /
What difference is betwix an ydolastre and an auar^cious man / ^auenture an
ydolastre has but on mawmet or two / And the auaricious man has many For
certes (...) floreyn in his cos^e is his mawmet. And certes (...) sin of
mawmetrie god forbedeth in the ten comandem^ts as (...) witness (...). Thou
shall have no false goddis ^iforn me ne thu shall make to the no grauid thing
But an Auaricious man loves more his tresour forgid And through this sin of
avarice and of Couetyse comyth these hard lordshippis thorugh which men be
streyned by talagis customs and cariagis more than her dute or reason is / or
else take they of her bond men amercementis Which might more resonably be
called extorsions than amercementis / Of which amercementis and raunsonyngis
of bond men som^e lordis stywardis sayn that it is rightful / for as mykyl as
a chorle has no temporel thing that it ne is his lordis as they sayn / But
certis these lordships don wrong that bereuen her bond folk things that
they never yaf hem / Augustinus de Ciuitate dei libro.ixo. Says that soth is
that the condicyon of thraldom and the first cause of thraldom is for sin /
Genesis.vo. thus may ye see that the gilte deserves thraldom and not nature /
wherefore these lords should not glory hem in her lordshippis / since that by
naturel condition they be not lordis of her thrallis / but that thraldom com
first by sin ^ And ferth^rmore there as the law s^yth that temporel lords of
bond folk ben the goods of her lordshippis ye that is for to understand the
goodis of the emperor to defend him in her right but not to rob hem ne to
reave hem ^ And therefore says Seneca / Thy prudence should live benygnely with
thy thral ^ that thou clepest thy thral ben goddis people For humble folk ben
crystes friends ^ they be contubernyal with the lord / New comes disceyt
between merchant and merchant / And thou shall understand that marchandyse
is in many manners / That one is bodily and that other is goos^ly / that one is
lesful ^ And that other is dishonest and vnleefful / That bodily marchandyse
that is leefful and honest is this / that there as god has ordeynd that a
royame or a contre is suffycyent to him self it is honest and leefful that the
habondance of this contre may help anoth^r contre that is more nedeful /. And
therefore there must be marchandyse to b^ynge from on contre to another their
marchandyse /. That other merchandise is that men haunten false othis with
fraud trecherye and disceyt with lesyngis cursid and dampnable / Spirytuel
marchandyse is properly symonye / that is ententyf desire to thing spirytuel /
that is thing that apperteyneth to the seyntwary of god and to cure of soul /
This desire if so be thar a man do his dyligence to perform hit / al be it
that his desire take non^ effect / yet is it to him a dedely sin / and if he
be ordryd he is Irreguler /. Certes symonye is cleped of Simon Magus that would
by temperall catell have bought the yeft that god had yeuen by the holy ghost to
saint P^tir and to the apostlis / And therefore understand ye that both he that
sellith and he that byeth things spyrytuel ben clepyd symonyaks / be it catel
be it procuryng or ^y flesshly prayers of his friends or of spirytuel frendis
/. Flesshly in two manners as by kynred and by other frendis / sothly if they
pray for him that is not able ne worthy / it is symonye if he take the been
fyce / And if he be worthy and able it is none / That other manner is ^han men
or women prayen for folk to auance him only for wicked fle^^hly affection that
they have to ^he persons / that is foul symonye / But certis in seruyse for
which men give thingis spirytuel unto her seruauntis it must be understand
that the seruys^ be honest or else not / And eke that it be without barganyng
and that the person be able / For as says saint Damas All the synnys of the
world at regard of this sin ben as thing of naught / For it is the grettest
sin that may be after the sin of lucifer and of anticryst / For by this
sin god for lesith the church and the soul that he bought with his precious
blood by hem that yeuyn chirchis to hem that be not digne / For they put in
theuys that stelyn the sowlis of Ihesu Crist and distroye his patrym^nye / By
such vndigne preestis and curates have men the less reverence of the
sacraments of holy church / And such y^uers of chirchis put out the children
of Crist and put in to the chirchis the deuyllis owen children / They sellen
the souls that shall keep the lambis to the wolf that strangle hem. And
therefore shall they never have part of the pasture of lambis that is the bliss
of heaven / Now comyth hasard^^e with his appertenauntis as tablis / quardes and
reuell^s. of which comyth disceyt false othis / chidyngis / and all raueyns /
blasfemyngis / reynyng of god / h^te of his neighbors / wast of goodis /
myspendyng of time / And som^etyme manslaghter / Certes hasardours may not be
with out great sin whiles they hauntyn that craft / Of auaryce comyth eke /
lesyngis / theft / falswitnes / and fals^ othis / And ye shall understand that
these ben great synnys and expres against the comandements of god as I have said
Falls witness is eke in word and in ded^ ^ In word as to byreue thy neighbors
good name by thy falls witnessyng or accusest him by thy falls witness / or ellis
excusest thy self falsely / ware ye questmongers and notaryes / Certes for falls
witness was ^usanne in great sorrow and pain and many another mo / The sin of
theft is express also against gods heest / And that in two manners / temporel
and spirytuel / The temporel theft is as for to take thy neighbors catel
against his will be it by fors or by sleyght be it in metyng or mesure / by
stelyng by false endytements upon him / and in borowyng thy neighbors catel in
intent never to pay and semblable thingis / Sp^rytuel theft is sacrylege that
is to say ontyng of holy thyngis / or of thyngis sacryd to Crist in two manners
/ by reason of the holy place / As chirchis and chircheyerdis for every violent
sin that men do in such places may be clepid sacrylege. Also they that
falsely witholde the rightes of holy church. And pleyn^ and generally
sacrylege is to give holy thing out of holy place / or unholy thing out of holy
place / or holy thing out of unholy place / Now shall ye understand that
releuyng of auaryce is Myserycorde and pity largely taken / And men might axe
why that myserycorde and pity is releuyng of auaryce / Certes the auaricyous
man shewith no pity ne myserycorde to the nedeful man. For he deliteth him in
keeping of his tresour / and not in the rescowyng ne in the releuyng of his even
christian /. And therefore speak I first of mysericorde / Then is mysericorde As
says the phylosophre a virtue by which courage of man is styred by the mysese
of him that is mysesid. upon the which myserycorde with pity in perfourmyng of
Charytable werkis of mercy helps and comfort him that is mysesed / And
certes this meueth men to the misericorde of Ihesu Crist that him self suffrid
for our gilt He suffryd death for misericorde / And foryaf us our original
synnys / And thereby relecid fro the pain of hell and amenusid the pain of
purgatory / The spicis of misericorde ben as for to lene and eke for to give /
and forto fory^^^ and for to relece / and for to have pity in heart and
compassion of myschyef of thyn even christian / And eke chastyce there as need is
/ Another remedy against auaryce is reasonable larges / But sothly here behooves
the consideracion of our lord Ihesu Crist and of his grace and of his temporel
goodis and eke of the go^dis perdurable that Crist yaf us / and eke to have
remembrance of the death that ^e s^al dye and receive / and he woot not when /
And eke that he shall forgoon all that he has dispendid and gotten in goodis /
But for as much as som^e folk be unmeasurable. men oughten eschew fool

catel but ^e lesith his catel / Certes what thing that ^e y^^^th for veyn
glory as to mynstrals and to ^^lk that bear his renome in the world he has do
sin and none alms / Certes ^e lesith foul his good and sekith no thing but
sin / ^e is like to an horse that seeks rather to drink dropp^ water and
troubly / than water of the clear well / To ^em apperteyn^n the malison that
Crist shall give a^te day of d^me to hem that shull be dampened.

.Sequitur de Gula.
AFter auaryce comyth glotonye / which is express against the commandment of
god. / Glo^^nye is unmeasurable appetyte to ete or to drink / or else to ete
immeasurably and out of time more than needs is glotonye This sin corr^ptid
all this world as is well shewid in the sin of Adam and Eve / Lo eke what says
seint Paul of glotonye / Meny men says he of which I have often said you /
and now I say hit weeping that they be enemies of the cross of Crist / of
which the end is death and of which her womb is her god / And her glory in
confusyon of hem that so seruyn erthely thyngys / He that is vsaunt to this
sin of glotonye / He may no sin wythstande / He mote be in seruage of all
vices for it is the deuyllis horde there he hydeth him in and restyth /. This
sin has many spyces / The first is dronkenes / that is the horrible
sepulture of man's reason / And therefore when that a man is drunk / he has
lost his reason and this is dedely sin /. But certes when a man is not wont to
strange drynkis / and perauenture knows not the strength of the drink or
has feebleness in his head or has trauaylled through which he drynketh the more
/ al be he suddenly caught with drink it is no dedely sin but venyal. The
second spyce of glotonye is / that the spyryte of a man wexith al trouble For
dronkenes bereueth him discrecyon of his wytt /. The third spice of glotonye
is when a man deuoureth his mete and has no rightful manner of etyng. The
fourth is when through the great habundan^ce of his mete the humors of his
body ben distemperyd. The fifthe is foryetfulnes by to much drynkyng / For
which a man foryetyth by the morrow what he did over eve /. In another manner
ben distyncte the spyces of glotonye after saint Gregore / The first is for to
ete byf^re time / The Second is when a man getith him to delicate mete / The
third is when men taken to mykil over mesure / The.iiij. is curyosite with
great entente to maken and apparaylle his mete / The fyfthe is for to ete
gredily / These ben the fyu^ fyngers of the deuyllis hand by which he draws
folk to sin / Against glotonye is the remedy Abstynence of his body as says
Galyene / but that hold I not meritorye if he do it only for hele of his body
/ Saint Austyn wole that abstynence be do by virtue and with patience /
Abstinence he says is litil worth / but if he have good will / and but he be
enforcyd by pacyence and by charity / and that men do it for godis sake / and
in hope to have the bliss in heuene / The felaws of abstinence ben
attemperance that holds the mean in all thingis eke shame that escheweth al
dishoneste suffisance that sekith no rich metis ne drynkis ne does no force of
none outrageous appareyllyng of mete Also that restreyneth by reason the delauye
appetyte of etyng and drynkyng / Sobrenes also that restreyneth the outrage of
drink / Sparyng also that restreyneth the delic^t ^ase to sicte long at his
mete / wherefore som^e folk stonden of her owen will when they ete be cause they
will ete at less leyser. /

.Sequitur de Luxuria.
AFter glotonye then comyth lecherye / For these two synnys ben so nyghe
cosyns that often time they will not depart / God woot this sin is full
displaysaunt to god / For he said him self do no lecherye / And therefore he
puts great peynes against this sin For in tholde law if a woman thral were
taken in this sin she should be betyn with stauys to the death / And if she
were a gentyl woman she should be slain with stonys / And if she were a bisshops
daughter she should be brent by goddis com^andement / Furthermore for the sin
of lecherye god dreynt all the world / And after that he brent five cytees and
sanke ^oun in to hell. Now let us speak then of the sin of lecherye that
men clepen auoultrye that is of wedded folk that is to say if that one of hem
be weddid or else both. Saint John says that thauowtrers shul be in hell in a
s^ynkyng brennyng pyt of fire and brymston. For lecherye is likenyd to brymstom
for the stynke of her ordure. Certes the bereuyng and breking of this sacrament
is an horrible thing H^t was made of god him self in paradyse and confermed by
Ihesu Crist / As says saint Matthew in the gospel / A man shall let fader and
mother and take him to his wife / and they shall be two in one flessh / This
sacrament betokens the knyttyng to gyder of Crist and of holy church / And
not only that god forbad auowtry in deed / but eke he commanded that thu
sholdest not coueyte thy neighbors wife / In this heest says saint Austyn / Al
manner couetyse to do lecherye is forboden / Lo what says saint Matthew in the
gospel who so sees awoma^ to couetyse of his lust / He has don lecherye with
her in his heart / Here may ye see that not only the deed of this sin is
^orbode / but eke the desire to do that sin / This cursid sin anoyeth
grievously hem that it haunte and first to the soul. For he obliges it to
sin and to pain of death that is p^rdurable / and to the body anoyeth it
grievously For it dries him / and of his blood he makes sacrifyce to the fend
of hell / hit wastes his catel and his substance And certes if it be a foul
thing a man to waste his catel on women / yet is hit a fouler thing that when
for such ordure women spenden upon men her catel and substance This sin as
says the prophet byreuyth a man and a woman her good fame and al her honor /
and it is full playsant to the devil / For thereby wynneth be the most party of
this world / And right as a merchant deliteth him most in chaffare that he has
most advantage of / right so deliteth the fend in this ordure / This is that
other hand of the devil with five fyngers to cacche the people to this vilony /
The first finger is the foul lokyng of the fool wo^man that sl^eth right as
the basiliook sleeth folk by the venym of his sight / For couetyse of the eyes
follows the couetyse of the her^e / The second finger is the vilayns touching
in wickid manner / And therefore says Salamon That who so touchith and handelith
a woman / he faith like him that handelyth the scorpion that s^yngyth and
sodeinly sleeth through his ^^uemynyng or as who so t^uchyth pycche he shendeth
his fyngris / The third is foul words that farith like fire that brennyth
that right anon brennyth the heart / The fourth is kyssing And trewly he were
a great fool that would kiss the mouth of a br^nnyng ouyn or of a furneys / And
more foolis ben the^ that kyssen in vilony / For that mouth is the mouth of
hell / And namely these old d^tardis holours yet will they kiss though they
may not d^^ and smater ^em / Certes they be like to houndis / For an b^und when
he comes by the roser / or by other benchis ^f he may not pysse yet will he
heue up his leg and make countenance to pysse / And for that man wenyth that
he may not sin for lichorousnes that he does with his wife / Certes that
oppynyon is false God woot a man may sle him silf with his owen knyff and make
him drunk with his owen tonne / Certes be it wife or child or worldly thing
that he louith before god. it is his mawmet / and he is an ydolastre / Man
should love his wife by discrecion patiently and attemperatly / And than is she
as though she were his suster / The fyfte finger of the deuyllis hond is the
stynkyng deed of lecherye / He grypeth him by the reins for to throw him in
to the furne^s of hell / there as they shall have the fire and the worm^s that
ever shall lasten / weeping and wayling / sharp hunger and thirst Grislynes of
deuillis that shulle al to trede him without respite and withouten end / Of
lecherye as I s^yde s^urden diuerce spyces as fornicacion that is betwi^ man
and woman that been not married and this is dedely sin and a^^^st nature / And
destruction to nature is against nature / Persay the reason tellith him eke that
it is dedely sin for as much as god forbad lecherye / And saint Poule yeuyth
him the regne that is due to no wight / but to hem that do no dedely sin /
Another sin of lecherye is to bereuen a maid of her ma^denhede / For certes
he that so does he cacchyth a maid out of the h^est degree that is in this
present life / And ^ereueth her that precious fruit that the book clepeth the
hundred fruit / I can say it none other wise in englissh / but in latin it
hight centesimus fructus / Certes he that so does is cause of many dom^ages and
vilonyes mo than any man^ can rekene / right as he sometime is cause of all
damages that bestis do in the f^lde that breketh the hegge of the closure /
through which he destroieth that may not be restored / For certis no more may
maydenhede be restored. than an arm that is smyten fro the body may return
again towexe / She may have mercy this woot I well / if she do penytence / but
never shall it be / but that she is corupt / and al be it so that I have spoke
somewhat of auoultrye / it is good to show mo peryllis that longen to aduoultry
for teschue the foul synnys of aduoultrye / In latin it is for to say
thapproching of another mannys bed / through which they that were one flessh
habounden her bodies to other persons / Of this sin as says the wyseman
come many harmys First brekyng of feith And certis feith is keye of Cristendome
/ And when that keye is broken and ^^^n Certain cristendom standith without
fruit / This sin is eke theft for theft generally to speak of / is for to
reave a thing of a man against his will / Certis this is the foul^st theft that
may be / when a woman stelith her body from her husbond and yeueth it to her
holour to defoule it and stelyth her soul from Crist and yeuyth hit to the
devil. This is a foul theft for to stele and break the Chalys. For these
aduoultreris breken the temple of god spirytuelly and stelyn the vessel of
grace / that is the body and the soul / For which Crist shall destroy hem as
says saint Paul / Sothly of this theft doubtyd greatly Joseph. when that his
lordis wife praid him of vilonye when he said / Lo my lady ^ how my lord has
take to me under my ward all that he has in this world ^ ne nothing is out of
my power but only ye that be his wife / and hou should I then do this wickidnes
and sin so horrible against god Alas al to litil is such troth now y found
/ The third harm is / the fylthe through which they break the commandment of
god and defowle the awter of her matrymonye that is Crist. For certis in so
mykyl as the sacrament of marriage is so noble and so digne so much it is the
gretter sin to break it. For god made marriage in paradyse in the state of
Innocencye to multiplye mankind to the seruyse of god / And therefore is the
brekyng thereof grievous Of which brekyng common falls heirs / often time that
wrongfully occupien folkis heritagis / And therefore will Crist put hem out of
the regne of heaven that is heritage to good folk / Of this brekyng comyth eke
that folk un waar wedde / or sin with her owen kynrede / And namely the
harlottis that haunten bordellis / Thise fool women mow be liken^d to a common
gonge where as men purge her ordure What say^ we eke of putyers that lyuen by
the horrible sin of putrye / and constreyne women ye som^e her owen wyuys or
his child as don these bawdis to yield hem a certain rent of her bodily
putrye / Certis these ben cursid synnys / Understand ye eke that aduoultrye is
set comynly in the ten comandementis bitwene theft and manslaghter For it is
the grettest th^fte that may be. For it is theft of body and of soul / And it
is like to homicyde / For it keruyth a two hem that first were made one flessh
/. And by the old law they should be slain / but natheles by the law of Ih^su
Crist that is the law of pity / when he said to the woman that was found in
auoutrye /. and should have be slain with stones after the will of the Iewis as
was her law / Goo quod Ihesu Crist and have no more will to do sin / Sothly
vengeance of auoultrye is awarded to the peyn of hell / but it be distourbyd
with penance / Yet ben there mo spyces of this cursid sin as when that one of
hem is religyous or ellis both / or of folk that been entryd in to order as
Subdeken / or deken / pressed / or hospitalers / and ever the hyer that he is in
order / the gretter is the sin / For they have made great vows to keep
Chastity / This sin of brekyng of his auowe of chastity is when he resceyued
order / And soth it is that holy order is chief of all the tresour of god and
is a special sign and mark of chastity which that is the most precious life
that is / And eke this ordrid folk ben specially titled to god for which when
they do dedely sin / they ben the specyal traitors of god and of his people
/ For they live by the people to pray for the people / And whiles they be such
traitors her prayers avail not to the people / Prestis ben as aungellis as by
the mystery of her dignyte / But forsor^e saint Paul says that Sathanas
transfourmeth him in an aungel of light / Sothly the preeft that hauntith sin
He may be likned to an aungel of derknes transformed in to an aungel of light /
He seems an aungel of light. but forsothe he is an aungel of derknes / Such
prestis ben the sonys of hely as is showed in the book of kings that they were
the sonys of Belyal / that is the devil / Belial is to say withouten Judge /
And so faren they hem thinks that they be fre and have no Judge no more than
has a free bole that takes which kowe that him likes in the town / so faren
they be women / For right as a fre bole is ynowh for all a town / right so is a
corupt priest ynowh for all a parysh or a contre / These preestis as says the
book know not the mynistery of preesthode to the people ne to god ne they hold
hem not a paid as says the book of sode flesh that was to hem offryd / But
they take by force the flesh that is raw / Certis right so these shrewis hold
hem not a paid of rostid flesh and soden with which the pepyl ^eden hem in
great reverence / but they will have raw flesh as folkis wyuys and her
daughters / And certis these women that consentyn to her harlottis do great
wrong to Crist and to holy church / to all halowis and to all soulis / for
they bereuyn him all that should worship Crist and holy church. and also to
prayen for all christian soulis / And therefore have suc^e ^^^^stis and her lem^ans
that consentyn to her lechery the mali^^n of the christian court til they come to
amendment / The thir^^ spyce of auoultrye is sometime betwix a man and his wife
^ And that is when they take no regard in their assembling but only for
flesshly delight / as says saint Iherome and recke of nothing but they be
assemblid by cause they be married / Al is good y nowh as thinks to hem / But
in such folk has the devil power as said the aungel raphael to Tobye / For
in her assembling they put Ihesu Crist out of her heart / and give hem self to
all ordure / The fourth spyce is of hem that assemblyn by her kynrede or of
hem that been of one aff^nyte / or else with hem with whom her faders had delid
with the sin of lecherye / This sin makes hem like houndis that taken none
head of kynrede / And certes parentela is in two manners / or gostly or
flesshly. gostly is for to delyn with her gossibs / For right so as a godfader
is her fader spirytuel / For which a woman may in no less sin semble with
her gossib than with her owen brother. / The fyfthe sin is that abhomynable
sin of which noman ought to speak of / ne write / natheles it is openly
rehercid in holy wryt / Certes holy wryt may not be defouled more than the
son that shyneth on a donghill Another sin apperteyneth to lecherye that
comyth in slepyng / and this sin comes often to hem that been maidens and eke
to hem that been corupt And this sin is cleped pollucion / that comes in
four manners Sometime it comes of languysshyng of the body of man / Sometime it
comes of Infirmyte for the feebleness of the virtue retentyf as phesik makes
mencyon / Sometime of furfete of mete and drink / and sometime for violente
thoughtis that been enclosid in mannys mind when he goth to slepe^ which may
not be with out sin / For which men must keep hem wisely / or else may they
sin grievously. Now comes remedy against lecherye / and that is generally
chastise and contynence that refreyneth all disordinat meuyngis that common of
fleshly talentis / And ever the gretter merit shall he have that refreyne^^^
^ost the wicked chauffyng or ordure of this sin. And this is in two manners
that is to say chastity of marriage and chastity of wedow^ede. Now shall thou
understand that Matrymony is leefful assemblyng of man and woman that receyuen
the virtue of the sacrement / the bond which that may not be departid in all
her life / this is to say whylis they live both. This is as says the book a
full great sacrement. God made it as I have said in paradyse and would him self
be born in marriage / and forto halowe marriage he was at wedding where he
turned water in to wyn^ / which was the first miracle that he wrought in earth
to fore his discyples / The true effect of marriage clensith fornicacion and
replenysshith holy church of good lynage. For as the end of marriage chaungith
dedely sin in to venyal bitwene hem that been weddid and makith the hertis al
one as well of hem as the bodies / Thus is verry marriage that is stablisshid by
god or that sin began when naturel law was in his right point in paradys /
And it was ordained that a woman should have but one man As says saint Austyn
by many resons / First that marriage is figured between Crist and holy church /
And another is that a man is heed of the woman algate by ordinance it should be
so / For if a woman had mo men than one / then should she have moo h^^dis than
one / and that were an horrible thing before god / And eke a woman might not
plese many folk attones / And also there should never be pees ne rest amongs
them for euerich would ask his owen thing / And furthermore noman should know
his owen engendrure ne who should have his heritage / and the woman should be
less louid fro the time that she were commyxt with many / Now c^myth how a man
sh^ld bear him with his wife and namely in two thingis that is to say in
suffraunce and in reverence. And this sh^wde first crist when he made first
woman For he made her not of adams heed For she should not have to great
lordship ^or there as the woman has the maistrye she makith to much disa^aye
/ there need none ensamplis of this The xperience that we have day by day ought
to suffyse / Also certes ne he made not the woman of the feet of Adam / for she
should not behold to low / for she can not patiently suffer / But god made
woman of the ryb of Adam / For woman should be felawe unto man / Man should bear
him to his wife. in faith. in truth and in love as seyth saint Poule / and
that man should l^ue his wife as Crist did holy church that louyd it so well
that he deyde for hit / So should a man for his wife if it were need / Now how
that a womman should be subget to her husbond that tellyth saint Peter and eke
as says the decree / a woman as long as she is a wife / she has none
auctoryte to swear ne to bear wytnes with outen leave of her husbond / And also
she should be honest and attemperat of array / I wot well that they should sect
her entente to plese her husbondes / but not by queyntyse of her array / saint
Iherome says that wyu^s ben apparayllyd in silk and in purpure may not
clothen hem in Ihesu Crist / saint Gregore says eke that no wig^t seeks no
precious array / but only wyn glory to be ^^nourid the more beforn the people /
hit is a great folly a woman to have great array outward and her self to be full
Inward A wife should eke be mesurable. in lokyng. in beryng and in lawhyng and
discrete in all her words and her deeds And above all worldly thingis she
should love her husbonde with all her heart and to him be true of her body So
should every husbonde eke be true to his wife ^ for sithynal the body is the
husbondis so should her heart be also or ellis there is betwix hem two no parfyt
marriage as in that ^ Than shall a man understand that for three thingis a man
and his wife mow assemble / The first for thentent of gendrure of children to
the seruise of god. For certis that is the cause fynal of matrymony / That
other is to yield eueryche of hem the de^te of her body / For neither of hem
has power of his owen body / The third is for teschewe lecherye and vilonye
/. The fourth forsothe is dedely sin / As to the first it is meritorye / The
second also for the decree says she has merit for that she yeldith to her
husbond the debt of her body / Ye though it be against her l^kyng and the lust
of her heart / The third manner which is teschewe lecherye / I hold it no
dedely sin. but many of these be not without venyal sin for the corupcyon
and delight thereof / The fourth manner is to understand if that they assemble
only for amerouse love and for none of the foresaid causis but for taccomplissh
t^^ br^nnyng delight they recke never how often / sothly it is a de^e^y s^nne /
and yet with sorrow som^e folk will p^yne hem more to do than her appetyte
suffyseth / The second manner of chastyte is to be clean wydowe to eschew the
brasynge of man and to desire them brasyngis of Ihesu Crist / These ben tho
that have been wyuys and have forgoon her husbondis / And eke women that have
don lecherye / and be releuyd by penance / And certis if that a wife can keep
her al chaste by license of her husbonde / so that she gaf no cause ner none
occasion that he agiltyd Hit were to here great merit / These manner of women
that obs^ruen chastity must be clean in heart as well as in body and in thought
and mesurable in clothing and in contenan^ce Abstynent in etyng and drinkyng /
in spekyng / and in deed And then is she vessel of the box of the blissyd
Mawdeleyn that fulfilled holy church full of good odor. / The third manner of
chastyte is virginite / and hit behouyth that she be holy in heart and clean of
body / then is she the spouse to Ihesu Crist / and she is the life of
aungellis / she is the preysing of this world and she is as these martirs in
regalye / She has in her that tongue may not tell / virginyte bare our lord
Ihesu Crist / and virginite was him self Another remedy against lecherye is
specially to withdraw such thyngis as yeuyn occasion to that vilony as etyng
and drynkyng. For certes when the pot boyleth strongly The best remedy is to
withdraw the fire / Slepyng long in great quyete is eke a great norice to
lecherye / Another remedy against lecherye is that a woman or a man eschew
company of hem by which he demyth to be temptid for all be it so that the deed
be withstand yet is there great temptacion / Sothly a white wall al though it
brenne not fully by the stynkyng of a candel / yet is the wall black of the
light / In like wise often times such persons have evil name be cause they
draw in vicyous company / well often time have I red that noman trust in his
owen perfection but he be strenger than Sampson / holyer than David / wis^r
than Salamon / Now after as I have declared you as I can of the.vij. dedely
synnys and som^e of her branches and her remedies / Sothly if I could I would
tell you the ten com^andements / but so high a doctrine I le^e to divines But
natheles I trust to god they be touchid in this tretyse euerich of hem all.

Adhuc secunda pars penitencie.
NOw as to the second part of penytence hit stont in confession of mouth as I
began in the second chapitre to fore / Saint Austyn says sin is in every
word and in every deed / and all that men coueyten against the law of Ihesu
Crist / And this is for to sin in heart in mouth and in deed by thy five
wyttis / that been sight heeryng. smellyng / tastyng or sauoryng / and felyng /
Now is hit good to understand the ^^^^umstancis that agruggen m^kyl every
sin / Thou shall ^onsidere what thou art that do the sin / whethir thou
be m^le or female / young or old Gentil or thral / fre or seruaun^ ^ wise or
fool / hool or syke. weddid or syngle / ordryd or v^ordred / clerk or seculer.
If she be of thy kyn^ede bodily or gostly or none / a may^^n or none / in manner
of homicyde or none / horrible great sin or small / and how long thou have
continued in sin The threde Circumstaunce is the place where thou have don
sin / Whether in other men's housis or in thyn ow^n / in f^lde or in (...) or
in chircheyerd / In church dedicate or no^ For if the chir^he were hallowed and
man or woman spylle his kind withyn that place by wey of sin or by wicked
temptacion the church were ^nterdited til it were reconcyled by the ^^sshop /
And the p^eest should be enterdited that did such a vi^^nye / term of his life
and he should no more sing mass / and if he did he should do dedely sin at
every time that he song mass / The.iiij. circumstance is by such mediators
as by messangers or for entisement. or for consentement to bear company with
felawship. For many one for to bear felawship will goo to the devil of hell.
For they that eggyn or consenten to the sin ben parteners to the sin and of
the dampnacion of the synnar. The fyfthe is how many times that he has sinned
and it be in his mind / and how often he has fall / For ^e that often fallyth
in sin he dispyseth the mercy of god and encrecyth his sin / And is unkind
to god / And he wexith the more feeble to wistonde sin / and synneth the more
lightly / and the latter a^yseth / and the more eschueth forto shryue him / and
namely to him that has been his confessor. For which that folk when they
fall again in her old folyes they forletyn her old confessors al v^terly Or
ellis they departen her shryfte in diverse places / But sothly such departed
shryfte deseruyth no mercy of god for his synnys / The sixthe circumstaunce is
this why that a man synneth / as by what temptacion / and of him self procure
thilke temptacion / or by excytyng of other folk or if thou sin with a woman
by force / or by ^er owen assent Or if the woman magre ^^r (...) ^au^ he
enforced or not. and whethir for couetyse or pouerte / All this shall thou
tell / And if it was her procuryng or no and all suc^e manner thingis / The
seventh circumstaunce is in what manner he has don his sin / or how that she
has suffrid how folk have don to her / and of the same shall the man tell all
the circumstauncis / And if that he have sinned with common bordel women or none
/ in fasting times or none. or don his sin in holy times or none ^ or beforn
his shrifte Or after his la^ter shrifte / and bath pauenture therefore broken
his penance enjoined / by whose help and whose counceyll / by sorcery or craft /
al must ^e told these thingis after that they be great or small and grugge the
conscience of man or woman / And eke the priest that is the Judge may the better
be auysed of his Judgment / in yeuyng of his penance / and that shall be after
his contricion. For understand well that after time that a man has defowled
his baptesme by sin / if he will come to sauacion / there is none other weye
but penance and shrifte and satisfaction / and namely by the two / if there be
a confessor to whom he may shryue him / And that he first be very contryte and
repentaunt / And the third if he have lif to perform it / Then shall man
look and considere if he will make a true and a prouffytable confession / there
must be four conditions. First hit must be in sorouful bitterness of heart as
said the king Ezechye to god / I will remember all the yeris of my life in the
bitterness of my heart / This condition of bitterness has.v. signs / The first
is that confession must be shamefast not for to couereyn ne to hyde his sin
/ But for he has agiltid his god and defouled his soul / and hereof says
saint Austyn / The heart trauaylleth for shame of his sin / and for he has
great shamefastnes / he is digne to have great mercy / which was the
confession of the puplicane that would not lift up his eyes to heaven / for he
had offendid god of h^uen. For which shamefastnes he had anon the mercy of god
/ And therefore says saint Austyn That such shamefast folk ben next foryeuenes
and remission / That other sin is humylite of confession of which says
saint Peter / Humbles you under the mighty hand of god in confession. For
thereby god foryeuyth the synnys for he allone has power / This humylite shall
be in heart and in sign outward / For right as he has humylyte to god in his
heart / Right so should he humble his body outward to the priest that sits in
goddis place / For which in no manner / sithnys that Crist is souerayn and the
priest mean and mediator bitwene c^yst and the synnar And the synnar is less
by wey of reason / Than should not the synnar sytte as high as his confessor /
but knele byforn him or at his feet but if maladye destourbe it / For he shall
not take keep who sit there but in whose place he si^teth A man that has
trespaced to a lord and comyth for to are mercy and make his accord and set
him down anon by the lord Men would hold him outrageous and not worthy so
sone for to have remyssyon ne mercy / The third sign is that thy shryfte
should be full of teris if man may weep / And if a man may not weep with his
bodily eyes / let him weep in his heart. Such was the confession of saint
Petir For after he had forsake Ihesu Crist he went out and wept full bitterly /
The fourth sign is that ^e let not for shame to shryue him and show his
con^ession / Such was the confession of Mawdeleyn / that sparith for no shame
of ^em that were at the f^st^ / for to go to our lord Ihesu Crist and beknowe
to him her sin. The fyfthe sign is / that man and woman be obeyssaunt to
resceyue the penance that is enjoined hem / For certes Ihesu Crist for the
gylt of one man was obedyent to the death. / The second condition of very
confession is that hit be hastily done. ^ For certes if a man had a dedely
wound / ever the longer that ^e tarried to warisshe him / the more would it
corupte and haste him to his death / And eke the wound be the worse forto hele.
Right so farith sin that long time is in a man vnshewd Certis a man ought
hastily to show his sin for many causis / and for dread of death that comes
often time so suddenly and is in no certain what time it shall be ne in what place
And eke the longer he tarieth the ferther is he fro Crist And if be abide unto
his last day / scarsely may he shriue or amend him for his synnys or repent
him for the grievous maladye of his death / And for as much as he has not in
his lif her kenyd Ihesu crist when he has spoken unto him / he shall cry unto
our lord at his last day and skarcely he shall harken him Understand that this
condition must have four things. First that thy shrifte be pourueid before
and auised / And that a man can shriue him of his synnys be it of pride or of
envy and so forth with the spicis and circumstan^cis / And that h^ have
comprehendid in his mind the nombre and the gretenes of his synnys / and how
long he has leyen in sin / and eke that he be contrite of his synnys / and
be in stedefast purpoos by the grace of god never efte to fall again in sin
to which he is inc^^ned / also thou shall shriue the of all thy synnys to one
man / and not parcelmele to one man and parcelmele to another / Than is it to
be understand in thentent to perten thy confession as for shame or dread for
it nys but strangling in thy soul / For certes Ihesu crist is all good / in
him is none imperfection / And therefore he f^ryeuith al perfightly. and else
never a deel / I say not if thu be assigned to the penetan^cer for ^ertain
sin that thou art bound to show him all the remenaunt of thy synnys of
which thu have be shriuen of thy curate but if it ^^ke the of thin humilite /
this is no deperting of shrifte / ne I say not there as I speak of division of
confession That if thou have license to shryue the to a discrete and an honest
priest / and where the likes / and by the license of thy curate / that thou ne
may well shryue the of all thy synnys / but leet no blot behind / let no
sin be untold as fer as thou have remembrance / And when thou shall be
shryuen of thy curate / tell him eke all the synnys that thou have done sith
thou were last shryuen / Also the very shryfte askith certain conditions /
First that thou shryue the by thy fre will / not constreyned ne for shame of
folk. ne for maladye or such thingis / for it is reason that he that trespaceth
by his fre will confess his trespaas / ne none other man shall tell his sin
/ ne wrath him a^ens^ the priest for his amonesshyng to let his sin. The
se^ond condition is that thy shryfte be lawful / that is to sa^e ^h^u that
shryuest the / and eke the priest that ^erith thy confes^sion been verily in
the feith of holy (...) and that a man be not dispayrid of the mercy of Ihesu
^^^^t as Ca^^ and Judas were / And eke a man must accuse him self of ^is owen
trespaas / and not another / but he shall blame and wit him self of his owen
malice and of his s^nne and non other / But natheles if another man be e^^^^son
of en^tysyng of his synnys / or if the estate of a person be such by which
his sin is agreggid or else that he may not pleinly shryue but he tell the
person which he has synnyd with / then may ^e tell so that his entente be
not to bac^byte the person / but only to declair his confession ^ Thou shall
eke make no lesynge in thy confession for humylyte Perauenture to say that
thou have do synnys of which thou were never gilty / For s^ynt Aus^yn s^^th /
if thou by cause of humylite makist a lesyng of thy self though thou were not
in sin a fore / yet art thou in sin then through thy lesynge / Thou shall
eke show thy sin by thy propre mouth but thou be dombe / and not by letter /
for thou that have do sin / thou shall have the shame of thy confession. Thou
shall not eke peynte thy confession by fair and ^ubtil words to couere the
more thy sin For then begylest thou thy self / and not the priest / thou
must tell it pleinly be it n^uer so horrible ^e so foull / Thou shall eke
shriue the to a priest that is discrete to counceyl the / And eke thou shall
not shriue the for veyn glory ne for ypocresye / ne for no cause but only for
the doubt of Ihesu Crist and the hele of thy soul / Thou shall not eke run
to ^he priest al suddenly to ^^lle him lightly thy sin as who tellith a iape
or a tale. but auisedly with great devotion and general to shriue the ^^ter
than onys of sin which thou have be shriuen of / it is the more merit / For
as says saint Austyn / thou shall have the mo^e ^^ghtly relece and grace of
god / both of sin and of pain / And certis onys a year at the lest weye /
it is lawful for to ^e houselid. For sothly ones a year all things renouelyn.

Incipit tercia pars penitencie.
NOw have I told of v^ry confession that is the second part of penitencie /
The third part is satisfaction / and stondeth generally in alms deed and in
bodily pain / Now benther three manner of alms Contricion of heart where a
man offrith him self to god / Another is to have pity of defaute of his
neighbors / The third is in yeuyng of good counceyl and comfort bodily and
gostly where men have need and namely in substance of mannys food / And take
keep that a man has need of these thingis generally / he has need of food of
clothing and herberowh / he has need of charitable counceyllyng and visityng
in prison / and maladye and sepulture of deed bodies / And if thou ma^st not
visit the nedeful with thy person / visit him with thy message and thy
yeftis / These ben the general almesses of werkis of charity of hem that have
temporel richesse or discrescion in counceyllyng / Of these werkis shall thou
(...) at the day of dome this alms sholdest thou do of thy proper thingis
and hastily and privily if thou ma^st / But natheles if thou may not do it
privily thou shall not for^e^e to do alms though men see hit / so that it be
not do for th^nk of the world / but only for to have thank of our lord I^esu
Crist / For as witnessith saint Matthew / A C^te man not be hyd that is set upon
a mountayn / ne men light not a lantern and put hit under a buss^el / but
sec^en it upon a Candelstik to lighten the men in the house / Right so shall your
light / lighten before men that they mow see your good werkis and gloryfye
your fader that is in ^euen^ Now as for to speak of bodily pain / it stont in
prayers. (...) waking In fasting and in virtuous techyng of orisons / ^e shall
understand that orisons or prayers is for to say / A picto^ ^ys of heart that
is redressid in god and expressing it by word outward to remeue ^^rmeful
th^ngis / and to have thingis spirytuel and durable and sometime temporel
thingis / Of which orisons / in the o^ison of pater noster has Ihesu Crist
enclosid most thingis / Cer^^^ it i^ pryuylegid of three thingis in his dignyte
/ for which it is more digne than any other prayer for that Ihesu Crist him
self made it / and it is short / for it should be could the more lightly / and
forto withholde more esely in heart / and help him self the after with
thorison / and for a man should be the less weary to say it / and for a man may
not excuse him to learn it / hit is so short and so esy / and for it
comprehendith in him self all good prayers /. Thexposicyon of of this holy
prayer that is so excellent and so digne / I betake to the maistres of
theolegye / Save thus much will I say / That when thou prayest that god should
foryeue the thy gi^tys as thou forg^^yst hem that have agiltyd the Be well ware
that thou be not out of charity / This holy ^^ison amenus^th eke venyal sin /
And therefore it apper ^^yn^th specially to penitence / This prayer must be
treuly said in very feith / and that men pray to g^d ordinatly. dis^retly. and
devoutly. Alleway a man shall put his will ^o be subject to the will of god /
This oryson must eke be said with great humblenes and full pure and honestly.
and not to the anoysaunce of any man or woman / hit must eke be continued with
werkis of charity / hit avails eke against the vicis of the soul / For as
says saint Iherome. by fasting be sauyd the vicis of the flessh / and by
prayeres the vicis of the soul / After this thou shall understand tha^ bodily
pain stont in waking / For Ihesu crist says / wake y^ and pray ye that ye ne
enter in to wicked temptacion / ye shall understand that fasting stands in
three things / in forbering of bodily mete and drink / and in forbering of
wordly Iolytees / and in forbering of dedely sin with all his migh And thou
shall understand that god ordained fasting^ And to fasting apperteyneth four
thingis / largines to pour folk / gladness in heart spirytuel / not be angryd
ne to be anoyed ne to grucche for he fastith / And also reasonable hour for to
ete by mesure / That is to say that a man should not ete in vntyme ne sit the
longer at his table for he fastith / Then shall thou understand that bodily
pain stondeth in disciplyne or techyng by word or by writing / or by ensample
/ Also in weryng of heir / or of stamyn / or of an habergeon on her naked flesh
for cristis sake / and that ^uche manner penauncis / ne make not thy heart
bi^ter or angry ne anoyed of thy self / For better is to cast away thyn heyr
than to cast awey the swetenes of our lord Ihesu Crist. And therefore says
saint Poule / Clothe you as they that been chosen of god in her^ / of
mys^ricorde. debonairte. suffraunce and su^^^^^aner of clothyng / in which
Ihesu crist is more apaid than in an heyr or habergeon / than is disciplyne eke
in knockyng of thy breast / in scourgyng with yerdis. in knelyng. in
tribulacions. in suffryng (...) wrongis that be do to him / and eke in pacient
suffryng of maladyes / or l^synges / of worldly catel / (...) wife. or child.
or other frendis / Th^nne shall thou understand which things distourblen
penance / And this is in three manners that is dread / shame / and wanhope that
is despera^^on And for to speak of dread / for which he weneth he may suffer
no penance / there against is remedy for to think that bodily penance is but
short at regard of hell / that is cruel and so long that it lastyth
withouten end. Now against shame that a man has to shryue him / Should a man
think by way of reason / that he has not be a shamed to do foul thing /
Certis him ought not to be ashamed to do feir thingis and good thyngis / And
that is confessyons / A man should think that god woot al his thoughtis and his
werkis and to him may no thing be hyd ne couerid / Men should eke remember hem
of the shame that is to come at the day of dome to hem / that be not penytent
in this present ^^f. For all the creaturis in heuene and in earth and in hell
shul see appertly all that they hiden in this world / Now for to speak of hem
that been so necligent and slow to shriue hem / it stondeth in two manners /
That one is that he hops to live long / and forto purchase much riches for
his delight / And then will he shriue him as he says / he may as him seems
tymely ynow come to shrifte Another is the furquydrye that he has in Cristes
mercy. And against the first he shall think that our life is in no sikernes / And
eke that all the riches of the world is in adventure and passing as a shadow
on a wall / And as says s^mt Eregore That it apperteyneth to the great
rightwysnesse of god / that never shall the pain stynte of them that never would
withdraw hem fro sin her thankis but ever continued in sin / For that
perpetuel will to do sin. shall they have perpetuel pain / Wanhope is in two
manners The first wanhope is in the mercy of god / That other is that they
think that they may not long persevere in goodness / The first wanhope comes
of that he demeth that he has sinned so greatly / so often / and so long leyn
in sin that he shall not be saved / Certis against the cursid wanhope he should
think that the passion of Ihesu is more strong to vnbynd^ than sin is to
bind / And against the second wanhope he shall think that as often as he
fallith / he shall (...) by penytence / And though he never so long have leyn
in sin The mercy of Crist is always ready to resceyue him to mercy (...)
wanhope that he demyth that he should not long pers(...) in goodness / he shall
think that the febilnes of the deuy^ may no thing do but men wol suffer him /
And eke he shall have strength of god and of all holy ch^rche and of the
protectyon of aungellis if him list / Then shulle men understand what is the
f^uyt of penance / and after the word of Ihesu Crist / it is endeles bliss of
^^uene There joy has no contrariosite of woo ne greuaunce there all harmys
be past of this present life / there as is sikernes fro the peynes of hell /
there as is the blessid company that reioysen evermore eueriche of others Joy
/ there as the body of man that whyl^m was foull and derk is more clear than
the son / there as whylom the body was seek and freel. feeble and mortal / Is
i^mortal and so strong and so hool that there may no thing enpayre hit / t^^re
as neither is hunger ne thrist ne cold / but every soul replenesshid with the
sight of the parfyght knowing of the trynyte / This blesssid regne may man
purchase by pouert spirytuel / and the glory by lowness / the plente of Joy
by hunger and thr^st And the rest by trauayll / and the life by death and
mortificacion of sin / To that life he us bring that bought with his precious
blood Amen.

rectoris.
NOw pray I to hem all that herkene this litil tretyse or read / that if there
