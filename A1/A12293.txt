Skeleton Poeta.
Eterno mansura die dumlidera fulgent
Equora dumque tument hec lamea nostra virebit.
Hinc nostrum celebre et nome^ referetur ad astra.
Vndique Skeltonis memorabitur altera donis


ARectyng my sight toward the zodyake.
The signs.xij. for to behold a far
when mars retrograda^t reuersyd his bak
Lord of the year in his orbucular
Put up his sword for he cow^e make no war
and wha^ lucina plenary did shine
Scorpione ascendynge degrees twyse nine
In place alone then musing in my thought
How all thing passyth as does the somer flower
One every half my reasons forth I sought
How oftyn fortune varyeth in an hour
Now clear wether forthwith a stormy shower
All thing compassyd no perpetuyte
But now in welthe / now in aduersyte
So depely drownyd I was in this dumpe
Encraumpyss^ed so sore was my conceyte
That me to rest / I len^ me to a stumpe
Of an oak / that sometime grew full streyghte
A mighty tree and of a noble heyght
whose bewte blastyd was with the boystors wind
His leuis lost / the sap was from the rynde
Thus stood I in the frytthy forest of Galtres
Ensowkid with fylt of the myry mose
where hartis belluyng embosyd with distres
Ran on the raunge so long that I suppose
Few men can tell where the hynde calfe gose
Fair fall that forster that so well can bate his hownde
But of my purpose now torn we to the grownde
whylis I stood musing in this medytatyon
In slumbrynge I fell and half in a sleep
And whether it were of ymagynacyon
Or of humors superflue that often will crepe
In to the brain by drynkyng over deep
Or it procedyd of fatal persuacyon
I can not tell you what was the occasyon
But suddenly at ones as I me aduysed
As one in a trans or in an ecstasy
I saw a pauylyon wondersly disgysede
Garnysshed fresshe after my fantasy
Enhachyde with perle and stones preciously
The ground engrosyd and bet with bourne gold
That passing goodly it was to be hold
within that a princes excellent of port
But to recounte her rich abylyment
And what estates to her did resort
Thereto am I full insuffycyent
A goddess inmortall she did represente
As I hard say Dame Pallas was her name
To whom supplied the royal queen of fame
The queen of Fame. To dame Pallas
Princes most pusant of high preemynence
Renownyd lady a boue the sterry heuyn
All other transcendyng of very congruence
Madame regent of the science seuyn
To whose astate all noblenes most lene
My supplycacyon to you I arrect
where of I beseech you to tender the effect
Not vnremembered it is unto your grace
How you gave me a ryall commandment
That in my court skeleton should have a place
Because that he his time studyously has spent
In your service: and to the accomplysshement.
Of your request: regestred is his name
with laureate tryumphe in the court of fame
But good madame the accustom and usage
Of ancient poetis ye wot full well has been
Them self to embesy with all there holl courage
So that there workis might famously be seen
In figure whereof the were they laurel grene
But how it is skeleton is wonder slake
And as we dare we find in him great lake
For ne were only he has your promocyon
Out of my bokis full sone I should him raze
But since he has tastid of the sugared pocioun
Of elycoms well: refresshid with your grace
And will not endeavor himself to purchase
The favor of ladys with wordis elect
It is sittynge that ye must him correct
Dame Pallas To the queen of Fame
THe sum of your purpose as we are aduysid
Is that our servant is sum what to dull
where in this answer for him we have co^prisid
How ryuers rin not till the spryng be full
Beat a dum mouth than a brainles scull
For if he gloryously publisshe his matter
Then men will say how he does but flatter
And if so him fortune to write true and plain
As sumtyme he must vices remorde
Then sum will say he has but lyttill brain
And how his words with reason will not accord
Beware for writing remains of record.
Displease not an hundredth for one man's pleasure
who writes wisely has a great treasure
Also to furnisshe better his excuse
^uyde was baunssihed for such a skyll
And many mo whom I cowde enduce
^^^enall was thret par^e for to kill
^or certain enuectyfye: yet wrote he none ill
Saving he rubbid sum on the gall
It was not for him to abide the trial
In generrall words I say not gretely na^
A poe^e sometime may for his pleasure taunt
Spekyng in paroblis how the fox the gray
The gander the gose: and ye hudge oliphaunt
went with the pecok a geyne the fesaunt
The lesarde came lepyng and said that he must
with help of the ram ley all in the dust
yet diverse there be industryous of reason
Sum what would gadder in there conuecture
Of such an endarkid chapter sum season
How be it / it were hard to construe this lecture
Sophisticatid craftily is many a confecture
A another manes mind diffuse is to expound
yet hard is to make but sum fawt be found
The queen of fame to dame Pallas.
Madame with fa^our of your benynge sufferaunce
Unto your grace then make I this motyue
where to made ye me him to auaunce
Unto the rowme of laureat promotyue
Or whereto should he have the prerogatyue
But if he had made sum memoryall
whereby he might have a name inmortall
To pas the time in slowthfull ydelnes
Of your royal palace it is not the gyse
But to do sumwhat iche man does him dres
For how should Cato else be called wise
But that his bokis: which he did deuyse
Record the same: or why is had in mind
Plato: but for that he left writing behind
For men to look on: Aristotille also
Of philosophers callid the princypall
Old diogenes with other many mo
Dymostenes that orator royal
That gave eschines such a cordyall
That bannisshed was he by his proposicyoun
Again whom he cowde make no contradiccyoun
Dame pallas to the queen of Fame
SOft my good sister and make there a pawse
And was eschines: rebukid as ye say
Remember you wel^: point well ye clause
wherefore then rasid ye not a way
His name: or why is it I you pray
That he to your cour^e is going and coming
Since he is slaundred for defaut of konnyng
The queen of fame to dame Pallas.
Madame your apposelle is well inferrid
And at your auanuntage quikly it is
Towchid: and hard for to be barrid
yet shall I answer your grace as in this
with your reformacion if I say a mis
For but if your bounte did me assure
Mine argument else koude not long endure
As towchyng that eschines is remembered
That he so should be: me semith it siteyng
All be it great part he has surrendered
Of his mour: whose dissuasyue in writing
To courage demostenes was much excitynge
In sertyng out fresshely his crafty persuacyon
From which eschines had none euacyon
The cause why demostenes so famously is bruti^
Only procedid for that he did outray
Eschines? which was not shamefully confutid
But of that famous orator I say
which passid all other: wherefore I may
Among my records suffer him named
For though he were venquesshid yet was he not shamyd.
As ^^rome in his preamble ^^ater ambrocius
From that I have said in no point does vary
where in he reports of the coragius
words that were much consolatory
By eschines rehearsed: to the great glory
Of demostenes: that was his utter foo
Few shall ye find or none that will do so
Dame pallas to the queen of Fame
A Thank to have ye have well deseruyd
^our mind yt can maynteyne so apparently
But a great part yet ye have reseruyd
of that most follow then conseqently
Or else ye demean you in ordinatly
For if ye laud him whom honor has oppressed
Then he that does worste is as good as the best
But whom that ye favor I se well has a name
Be he never so little of substance
and whom ye love not / ye will put to shame
^e counterwey not euynly your balaunce
As well folly as wisdom often ye do avaunce
For report ryseth many deuerse ways
Sum be much spokyn of for making of frays
Some have a name for theft and brybery
Some be called crafty that can pyke a purse
Some men be made of for the mokery^
Some careful cok woldes / some have their wives curs.
Some famous wete would is / and they be much wurs
Some lidderous / some losels / some noughty packis
Some facers / some bracers / some make great crackis
Some dronken dastardis with their dry souls
Some sluggyssh slouyns that sleep day and night
Riot and revel be in your court rowlis
Maintenance and mischefe these be men of might
Extorcyon is counted with you for a knight
These people by me have none assignement
yet they ride and rinne from carlyll to kente
But little or nothing ye shall here tell
Of them that have virtue by reason of cunnyng
which souerenly in honor should excel
Men of such matters make but mummynge
For wisdom and sadness be out a sunnyng
And such of my servants as I have promotyd
One fault or other in them shall be noryd
Either they will say he is to wise
Or e^les he can naught bot when he is at scol^
Prove his wytt says he at cards or dyce
And ye shall well find he is a very fool
Twyse set him a chare or reche him a stol.
To sit him upon / and read jack athrummis bybille
For truly it were pity that he sat idle
The queen of Fame To dame Pallas
TO make repungnau^ce again yt ye have said
Of very dwte it may not well accord
But your benynge sufferau^ce for my discharg I lai^
For yt I would not with you fall at discord
But yet I beseech your grace that good record
May be brought forth such as can be found
with laureat tryumphe why Skeleton should be crownde
For else it were to great a derogacyon
unto your palas our noble court of ^ame
That any man under supportacyon
with out deseruynge should have the best game
If he to the ample increase of his name
Can lay any werkis that he has compylyd
I am content that he be be not exylide
From the laure at senace: by force proscripcyon
Or else ye know well I can do no less
But I most bannysshe him from my iurydiccyon
As he that aquentyth him with ydilnes
But if that he purpose to make a redress
what he has done let it be brought to sight
Grant my petycyon I ask you but right
Dame Pallas To the queen of Fame
TO your request we be well condiscendid
Call forth let se where is your clarionar
To blow a blaste with his long breath exte^did
Eolus your trumpet that kuowne is so far
That bararag blowyth in every mercyall war
(...) him blow now that we may take a vewe
that poetis we have at our retenewe
To se if skeleton will put him self in prease
^monge the thickeste of all the hole rowte
^ake noyst enoughe for claterars love no peace
^^r se my sister now speed you go a boute
^none I sey this trumpet were found out
and for no man hardely let him spare
^o blow bararag till both his eyne stare
Skeleton Poeta.
FOrth with there rose among the thronge
A wonderful noise / and on every side
They presid in fast / some thought they were to long
Su^e were to hasty and would no man bide
^ome whispred some to wnyd / some spoke / and some cryde.
^ith heuyuge and shouynge have in and have out
^ome ran the next way sum ran a bowte
There was suyng to the queen of fame
^e plucked him back / and he went a fore
^ay hold thy tunge quod a another let me have the name
^ake rowme said a another ye prese all to sore
^ume said hold thy peace thou getest here no more
(...) thowsande thowsande I saw on a plumpe
^ith that I hard the noise of a trumpe
That long time blewe a full tunorous blaste
^yke to the boryall wyndes when they blow
that towers / and towns / and trees down cast
^roue clouds to gether like dryfris of snow
^he dredefull dinne drove all the rowte on a row
^ome tremblid / some girnid / some gaspid / some gasid
^s people half peuysshe or men that were masyd
Anon all was whyste as it were for the nonys
And iche man stood gasyng and staryng upon other
with that there come in wonderly at ones
A murmur of mynstre^^ / that such a another
Had I never seen some softer some louder
Orphens the traciane herped meledyously
with amphion and other musis of archady
whose heavenly armony was so passing sure
So truly proporsionyd and so well did gree
So duly entunyd with every mesure
That in the forest was none so great a tree
But that he daunced for joy of that gle
The huge mighty oaks them self did auaunce
And lepe from the hills to learn for to dance
In so much the stumpe where to I me lent
Sterte all at ones an hundreche foot back
with that I sprange up toward the tent
Of noble dame Pallas whereof I spoke
where I saw come after I wot full little lake^
Of a thousand poets assembled to geder
But phoebus was formest of all that came theder
Of laurel leuis a cronell on his head
with heris enscrisped yalowe as the gold
Lamentyng daphnes whom with the darce of led
Cupyde has stryken so that she ne would
Concente to phoebus to have his heart in hold
But for to preserve her maiden hode clean
Transformyd was she in to the laurel grene
Meddelyd with murmynge the most perte of his muse
O thoughtfull heart was evermore his song
Daphnes my derlynge why do you me refuse
yet look on me that louyd you have so long
yet have compassyon upon my pains strong
He sange also how the tree as he did take
Between his arms he felt her body quake
Then he assurded in to his exclamacyon
Unto Diana the gods inmortall
O mercyles madame hard is your constellacyon
So close to keep your cloister virgynall
Enhardid adyment the sement of your wall
Alas what ayle you to be so ouerthwhart
To bannysshe pity out of a maidens heart
why have the gods showed me this cruelte
Since I contryuyd first princyples medycynable
I help all other of there infirmite
But now to help my self I am not able
That profyteth all other is no thing profitable
Unto me / alas that herb nor gras
The fervent axes of love can not repress
O fatal fortune what have I offen did
Odious disdain why raist you me on this facyou
But since I have lost now that I intended
And may not atteyne it by no medyacyon
yet in remembrance of daphnes tra^sformacyon
All famous poetis ensuynge after me
Shall were a garlande of the laurel tree
This said a great nowmber folowyd by and by
Of poetis laure ar of many diverse nacyons
Part of there names I think to specefye
First old Quintiliane with his declynacyons
Theocritus with his bucolycall relacyons
Esiodus the I cononucar
And homerus the fresshe historiar
Prince of eloquence tullius cicero
with salusty a geinst lucius catelyne
That wrote the history of iugurta also
o^yde enshryned with the musis nine
But blessed bacchus the pleasant god of wine
of closters engrosyd with his ruddy drops
These orators and poets refresshed there throtis
There titus lyuius him self did auaunce
with decadis historious which that he mengith
with matters that amount the romans in substance
Enyus that wrate of mercyall war at length
But blessed bachus potenciall god of strength
Of clusters engrosid with his ruddy drops
These orators and poetis refresshed there throtis
Aulus Gelius that noble historiar
Orace also with his new poetry
Master Terence the famous conucar
with plautus that wrote full many a comody
But blessed bachus was in there company
Of clusters engrosyd which his ruddy dropis
These orators and poetis refresshed there throtis
Senek full soberly wit his tragedijs
Boyce recounfortyd with his philosophy
And maxymyane with his mad ditijs
How dotynge age would iape with young folly
But bles^yd bachus most reverent and holy
of clusters engrosid with his ruddy dropis
These orators and poetis refresshed there throtis
There came John^ bochas with his volumys great
Quin^us cursus full craftily that wrate
Of Alexander / and macrobins that did trete
Of scipions dreme what was the treu probate
But blessed bachus that never man forgate
Of clusters engrosed with his ruddy dropis
These orators and poetis refresshid there throtis
Poggens also that famous florentine
Mustred there among them with many a mad tale
with a friar of france men call sir gagwyne
That frowmyd on me full angerly and pale
But blessed bachus that bore is of all vale
of clusters engrosyd with his ruddy dropis
These orators and poetis refresshid there throtis
Plutarke and Petrarke two famous clarkis
Lucilius and valerius maximus by name
with vincencius in speculo yt wrote noble warkis
Propercius and Pisandros poetis of noble fame
But blissed bachus that mastris often does frame
Of clusters engrosed with his ruddy dropis
These notable poetis refresshid there throtis
And as I thus sadly among them auysid
I saw Gower that first garnisshed our english rude
And master Chaucer that nobly enterprysyd
How that our english might fresshely be a meude
The monk of Bury then after them ensuyd
Dane John^ lydgate these english poetis three
As I ymagenyd repayrid unto me
To geder in arms as brethern enbrasid
There apparel far passing beyond that I can tell
with diamauntis and rubie there tabers were trasid
None so rich stones in turkey to sell
They wantid nothing but the laurel
And of there bounte they made me godely chere
In manner and form as ye shall after here
Master Gower. To Skeleton.
Brocher Skeleton your endeuorment
So have ye done that meretoryously
ye have deseruyd to have an enplement
In our collage above the sterry sky
By cause that encrese and amplyfy
The brutid britons of brutus albion
That welny was lost when that we were gone
Master Chaucer To Skeleton.
COunter wayng your besy delygence
Of that we began in the supplement
Enforcid ar we you to recompense
Of all our hooll collage by the agreament
That we shall bring you personally present
Of noble fame before the queen's grace
In whose court poynted is your place
Poeta Sketon answeryth.
O Noble Chaucer whose pullis^hyd eloquence
Our english rude so fresshely has set out
That bound ar we with all d^u reverence
w'all our strength that we can bry^ge about
To owe to you our service / and more if we mowte
But what should I say ye wot what I entende
which glad am to please and loath to offend
Master Lydgate. To Skeleton.
SO am I preuentid of my brethern tweyne
In rendrynge to you thankkis meritory
That welny no thing there does remain
wherwt to give you my regraciatory
But that I point you to be prothonatory
Of fames court by all our holl assent
Auaunced by pallas to laurel preferment
Poeta Skeleton answeryth
So have ye me far passing my meretis extollyd.
Master lidgate of your accustomable
Bownte / and so gloryously ye have enrollyd
My name / I know well be yonde that I am able
That but if my warkes thereto be agreeable
I am else rebukyd of that I intend
which glad am to please and loathe to offend
So finally when they had showed there deuyse
Under the form as I said to fore
I made it strange and drew bak ones or twyse
And ever they presed on me more and more
Till at the last they forcyd me sore
That with them I went where they would me bring
Unto the pauylyon where pallas was syttyng
Ame Pallas co^mau^did yt they should me co^uay
In to the rich palace of ye queen of fame
There shall he here what she will to him say
when he is callid to answer to his name
I cry anon forthwt she made proclaim
All orators and poetis should thider go before
wiht all the prese that there was less and more
Forth with I say thus wadrynge in my thought
How it was or else wtin what howris
I can not tell you / but that I was brought
In to a palace with turrettis and towris
Engolerid goodly with hallis and bowris
So curious^y / so craftily / so connyngly wrowght
That all the word I trow and it were sought
Such a another there could no man find
where of partly I purpose to expound
whiles it remanyth fresshe in my mind
with turkis and grossolitis enpauyd was the ground
^f hi^rall enbosid were the pyllers rownde
^f Elephantis tethe were the palace garis
Enlosenged with many goodly platis
Of gold entachid which many a precious stone
An hundred steppis mountyng to the halle
One of jasper a another of whalis bone
Of dyamauntis pointed was the wall
The carpettis within and tappettis of pall
The chambres hangid with clothes of arace
Enuaw^yd with rubies the vaw^e was of this place
Thus passid we forth walking unto the pretory
where y^ postis were enbulyoned with saphiris indy blew
Englau^d glittering with many a clear story
Iacineris and smaragdis out of the flor^he they grew
Unto this place all poetis there did sue
w^erin was set of fame the noble queen
(...) other transcendynge most rychely besene
Under a glorious cloth of asta^e
Fret all with orient perlys of garnate
Encrownyd as empress of all this wordly fate
So ^^ally so rychely / so passyngly ornate
It was excedyng by yonde the commowne rate
This house enuyrowne was a mile a bout
If.xii. were let in.xi^. hundredth stood without
Then to this lady and sovereign of this palace
Of purseuantis there presid in with many a diverse tale
Some were of poyle and sum were of trace
Of lymerik / of loreine / of spain of portyngale
From napuls / from nauern and from rounceuall
Some from ^^^nders sum fro these cost
Some from the main land / some fro the frensche host
with how does ye north what tydyngis in ye sowth
The west is wyndy ^ the est is me^ely well
It is hard ^o tell of every man's mouth
A slipper hold the tail is of an ele
And he haltith often that has a kyby hele
Some shewid his salt cundight some she wid his charter
Some lokyd full smothely and had a falls quarter
with sir I pray you a little tyne stand back
And let me come in to deliver my lettre
A another told how ships went to wrak
There were many words smaller and gretter
with I as good as thou / I faith and no better
Some came to tell creuth / some came to lie
Some come to flacer / some came to spy
There were I say of all manner of sortis
Of deremouth / of plummouth / of portismouth also
The burg^is / and the ballyuis of the.v. portis
with now let me come / and now let me go
And all time wandered I thus to and fro
Till at the last these noble poetis three
Unto me said / so sir now ye may se
Of this high court the daily besines
From you most we but not long ^o tarry
Lo hither commyth a goodly maysties
Occupacyon famys regestary
which shall be to you a sufferayne accessory
with syngular pleasurs to drive a way the time
And we shall se you again or it be pryme
when they were past and went forth on there way
This gentil woman that railyd was by name
Occupacyon in right goodly array
^ame toward me and smylid half in game
I saw her smyle and I then did the same
with that on me she kest her goodly look
Under her arm me thought she hade a book
Occupacyoun to Skeleton.
Like as the lark upon the summers day
when titan radiant burnisshith his bemis bright
Mou^ri^h on hy with her melodious lay
Of the sone shine engladid with the light
So am I supprysyd with pleasure and delyght
To se this hour now that I may say
How ye ar welcome to this court of array
Of your aqueintaunce I was in times past
Of studyous doctrine when at the port salu
The first aryuyd when broken was your mast
Of worldly trust then did I you rescu
your storm driven ship I repared new
So well entakeled what wind that ever blow
No stormy tempeste your barge shall over throw
welcome to me as hertely as heart can think
welcome to me with all my hole desire
And for my sake spare neither pen nor ynke
Be well assurid I shall a quyte your hyre
your name recountynge be yonde the land of tire
From sydony to the mount olympyan
From bab^ll towrets the h^llis Ga^^ian
Skeleton poeta answeryth
I Thanked her much of her most noble offer
^ffyaunsynge her my^e hole assurance
For her pleasure to make a large profer
^^^^^ntyng her words in my remembrance.
To owe her my (...) with true perseueraunce
Come on with me she said let us not stand
And with that word she took me by the hand
So passyd we forth in to the foresaid place
with such communycacyon as came to our mind
And then she said whylis we have time and space
To walk where we list / let us somewhat find
To pas ye time with / but let us wast no wind
For idle ^angelers have but lytill brain
words be swords and hard to call ageine
In to a field she brought me wide and large
Enwallyd about with the stony flint
Strongly enbateld much costious of charge
To walk on this wall she bed I should not stint
Go softly she said the stones be full glint
She went before and bad me take good hold
I saw a thowsande yaris new and old
Then questionyd I her what those yatis meant
whereto she answered and breuely me told
How from the est unto the occident
And from ye sowth unto the north so cold
These yatis she said which that ye behold
Be issuis and portis from all manner of nacyons
And seryously she showed me there denominacyons
They had writing sum greek / sum ebrew
Some roman letters as I understood
Some were old written / sum were written new
Some carectis of caldy / sum frensshe was full good
But one gate specially where as I stood
Had grauin in it of calcydony a capytall. A.
what yate call ye this / and she said Anglea
The beldynge thereof was passing commendable
whereon stood a lybbard crownyd with gold and stones
Terrible of countenance and passing formydable
As quikly towchyd as it were flesh and bones
As ghastly that glaris as grimly that gronis
As fersly frowning as he had been fyghtyng
And with his form foot he shoke forth this writing
Formidandammis ^ouis vltima fulmina tollis
Vnguibus ^re parat loca singula liuida curuis
Caco^^thico^ ex industria
Q^ modo perphebes Nummos raptura celeno
Arma / lues / ^uctus ^ fel^vis / fraus barbara tellus
Mill modis erra^ odium tibi qu^rere martis
(...)dar ^al^m^ea rose^o
Hen I me lent and looked over the wall
Innumerable people presed to every gate
She^ we^e y^ ga^is they might well knock and call
^n divine home ag^yne for they came al to l^ce
I her demanded of them and there astate
Forsothe quod she they^ be hastardis and r^bawdis
Dysers / ^^^^ers / ^um^lars with gambawdis
(...) of love with bawdry aqu^in^^d
Brainles blenkardis that blow at the cole
Falls forg^ts of money for kownnage atteintid
Pope holy ypocrytis as they were gold and hole
Powle hatche^^is yt prate will at every ale pole
Riot / reueler / railer / brybery theft
with other condycyons that well might be left
Sum feign them self folys and would be called wise
Sum medelynge spies by craft to grope thy mind
Sum dysdanous dawcokkis yt all men dispyse
Falls flaterers that fawn the and kurris otkynde
That speak fair before the and shrewdly behind
Hither they come crowdyng to get them a name
But hailid they be homwarde with sorrow and shame
with that I herd ^unnis rus^he our at ones
Bowns / bowns / bowns / that all they out cryde
It made sum lympe legged and broisid there bones
Sum were made penysshe porisshly pynk iyde.
That ever more after by it they were aspyid
And one there was there I wondered of his hap
For a gun stone I say had all to iaggid his cap
Raggid and daggid and cunnyngly cut
The blaste of ye byrnston blew away his brain
Masid as a march hare he ran like a scut
And sir among all me thought I saw twain
The one was a tumblar ye afterward again
Of a dysour a devil way grew a Ientilman
Pers prater the secund tha quarillis began
with a pellit of peuisshen^s they had such a stroke
That all y^ days of there life shall styck by ^her rybbis
Foo / fois^y bawdias sum smellid of the smoke
I saw diverse yt were ca^ijd away thens in cribbis
Dasyng after dotrellis like drunkardis yt dribbis
These titinyllis with taumpinnis were towchid and cappid
Mache mischefe I hight you / among thee^ there happid
Sometime as it semyth when ye moan light
By meanys of a grosely endarkyd cloud
Suddenly is eclipsid in the winter night
In like manner of wise a mist did us shrowde
But wel^ may ye thynk I was no thing proud
Of that auenturis which made me sore aghast
In derkenes thus dwelt we ^yll at the last
The clowdis began to cle^e / y^ (...) was rarifijd
In a an herber I saw brought where I was
There birdis on the br^re s^nge on every side
with alys ensandid about in compass
The bankis en^u^fid with singular solas
Enrailid with rosers and vinis engrapid
It was a new comfort of sorowis escapid
In the middis a coundight that coryously was cast
with pypes of gold engusshing out stremes
Of cristall the clerenes these waters far past
Enswymmyng with rochis / barbellis / and bremis
Englisterd: ye joyous it was to be hold
Then furthermore about me my sight I reuolde
where I saw growyng a goodly laurel tree
Enuerdurid with leuis contynually grene
Above in the top a bird of araby
Men call a phoenix: her wings between
She bet up a fire with the sparkis full kene
Oliua speci osa in ca^pis
with branches and bowghis of ye sweet olyue
whose flagraunt flower was chete preseruaryue
Against all infeccyons with cancour enflamyd
Against all baratows broisiours of old
quam excellenti am virtutis in oliua.
It passid all bawmys that ever were named
Or gummis of saby so derely that ve sold
There blew in that gardynge a soft piplyng cold
Enbrethyng of zepherus with his pleasant wind
All frutis flow^is grew there in there kind
Dryades there daunsid upon that goodly soil
wit the nine muses pierides by name
Phillis and testalus there tressis with oil
were newly enbybid: and rownd a bout the same
Grene tree of laurel much solacyous game
They made / with chapellettes and garlandes grene
And formest of all dame flora the queen
Of somer: so formally she fotid the dance
There cintheus sat twynklyng upon his harp stringis
And topas his instrument did auaunce
The poemis and storis ancient inbryngis
Of athlas astrology and many noble thyngis
Of wandryng of the moon / the course of the sun
Of men and of bestis and where of they begone
what thing occasionyd the showris of rain
Of fire elementar in his supreme spear
And of that pole artike which does remain
Behind the tail of vrsa so clear
Of pliades he prechid with there drowsy chere
Immoysturid with mis^yng and ay droppyng dry
And where the two troons a man should a spy
And of ye winter days that hy them so fast
And of the winter nyghtes that tarry so long
And of the somer days so long that does last
And of their short nyghtes / he browght in his song
How wrong was no right / and right was no wrong
There was counteryng of carollis in meter and verse
So many: that long it were to rehearse
Occupacyon. To Skeleton.
NOw say ye: is this after your appetite
May this content you and your mirry my^de
Here dwellith pleasure with lust and delight
Contynuall comfort here ye may find

Poeta Skeleton answeryth.
I Thank you goodly maystres to me most beny^ge

But my request is not so great a thing
That I ne force what though it be discurid

For by his deuellysshe drift it graceles provision
In hole rea^e he is able to set at deuysion

He will see men a frightynge and set him self still
And smerke like a smythy ^u^ o^ sperkes of st^ile

To tell all his towchis it were to great wonder

THus talkyng we went forth i^ at apostern gate
Turnyng on ye right hand by windy^g stayre
She brought me to a goodly chau^ber of estate
where the noble cowntes of Surrey i^ a chair

Of ladys above with all dew reverence
Sit down fair ladys and do your diligence
Come forth Ientylwomen I pray you she said
I have contryuyd for you a goodly warke
And who can work best now shall be a said
A cronell of laurel with verduris light and dark
I have deuysyd for Skeleton my clerk
For to his service I have such regard
That of our bownte we will him reward
For of all ladies he has the library
There names recountyng in ye court of fame
Of all gentylwomen he has the scuteny
In fames court reportynge the same
For yet of women he never said shame
But if they were counterfettes that women them call
That list of there lewdness with him for to brall
with yt the tappettis and carpettis were laid
where on these ladys softly might rest
The saumpler to sow on the lacis to enbraid
To weue in the stoule sum were full priest
with slaijs / with tauellis / with hedellis well dressed
The frame was browght forth with his weuyng pin
God give them good speed there warke to begin
Sum to enbrowde^ put them in prese
well gydyng there glowton^ to keep streit their sylk
Sum pirlyng of goldde their work to encrese
With fingers small and handis white as mylk

And wind me that botowme of such an hew
Grene / read / tawny / white / purpill and blew
Of broken warkis wrought many a goodly thing
In castyng / in turnynge / in florisshyng of flowris
with burris rowth and bottons surffillyng
In nedill wark raysyng byrdis in bowris
with vertuenbesid all times and howris
And truly of their bownte thus were they bent
To work me this chapelet by good aduysemente
Occupacyon. To Skeleton.
Behold and se in your aduertysement
How these ladys and gentylwomen all
For your pleasure do there endeuourment
And for your sake how fast to warke they fall.
To your remembrance wherefore ye must call
In goodly words plesauntly comprysid
That for them some goodly conseyt be deuysid
with proper captacyons of benevolence
Ornatly pullysshid after your faculte
Since ye must nedis afforce it by pretense
Of your professyoun unto vmanyte
Co^mensyng your process after there degree
To iche of them rendryng thankis commendable
with sentence fructuous and terms couenable
Poeta Skeleton answeryth.
AUaunsynge my self sum thank to deserve
I me determynyd for to sharp my pen
Devoutly arrectyng my prayer to mynerue
She to vowche safe me to inform and ken
To mercury also hertely prayed I then
Me to supporte to help and to assist
To gyde and to govern my dreadful tremlyng fist
As a mariner yt amasid is in a stormy rage
Hardly be stad and driven is to hope
Of that the tempeous wind will a swage
In trust whereof comfort his heart does grope
From the anchor he kuttych the gabyll rope
Committyth all to god and lettyth his ship ride
So I beseke ihesu now to be my gyde
To the right noble countes of Surrey
After all duly ordered obeisaunce
In humble wise as lowly as I may
Unto you madame I make recounsaunce
My life endurynge I shall both write and say

Of honor and worship it has the formar date
As dame thamarys which took the king of pere^
Cirus by name as wrytith the story
Dame agrippina also I may rehearse
Of ientyll courage the profight m^mory
So shall your name endure perpetually

Of honor and worship it has the formar date
To my lady elisabeth howarde
To be your remembrauncer madame I am bound

Of virtue and konnyng ye well and perfight ground

Of womanly feturis / whose florysshyng tenderage
Is lusty to look on plesaunte demure and sage
Goodly creisseid: fayrer than polexene
For to enuyue pandarus appetite
Troilus I trow if that he had you seen
In you he would have set his hole delight
Of all your bewte I suffyce not to wryght
But as I said your florisshinge tender age
Is lusty to look on plesaunt demure and sage
To my lady mirriell howarde

But to do you service nedis now I must
Beninge curteyse of ientyll heart and mind

The enbuddid blossoms of roses read of hew

Compare you I may to cidippes the maid
That of aconcyus when she found the byll
In her bosom / lord how she was afraid
The ruddy shamefastnes in her vysage fill

Right so madame the roses red of hew

CAstyng my sight the chamber about
To se how duly ich thing in order was
Toward ye door as we were coming out
I saw master newton sit with his compass
His plummet / his pensell / his spectacles with glass
Dyuysynge in pycture by his industrious wit
Of my laurel the process every whitte
Forthwith upon this as it were in a thought
Gower / Chawcer / Lydgate these three
Be fore remembered me curteisly brought
In to that place where as they left me
where all the said poetis sat in there degree
But when they saw my laurel rychely whought
All other beside were counterfete they thought
In comparyson of that which I ware
Sum praised the perle some the stones bright
well was him that there upon might stare
Of this warke they had so great delyght
The silk the gold the flowris fresshe to sight
They said my laurel was the goodlyest
That ever they saw / and wrought it was the best
In her astate there sat the noble queen
Of fame / perceiving how that I was cum
She wonderyd me thouhht at my laurel grene
She looked hawtly and gave on me a glum
Thhere was among them no word then but mum
For each man her kind what she would to me say
whereof in substance I brought this away
The queen of fame To Selton.
My friend since ye ar before hus here present
To answer unto this noble audyence
Of that shall be resonde you ye must be content
And for asmoche as by the hy pretense

Of laureat triumph: your place is here reseruyd
we will understand how ye have it deseruyd

Right high and mighty princes of astate
In famous glory all other transcendyng
Of your bou^te the accustomable rate
Has been full often and yet is entendyng
To all tho that reason is condiscendyng
But if hastyue credence by mayntenance of might
Fortune to stand between you and the light
But such euydence I think for to endure
And so largely to lay for mine indempnite
That I trust to make mine excuse
Of what charge so ever ye lay against me
For of my bokis part ye shall se
which in your records I know well be enrold^
And so occupacyon your regester me told
Forth with she commaundid I should take my place
Caliope poynted me where I should sit
with that oc^upacioun presid in a pace
Be mirry she said be not aferde a whit
your discharge here under mine arm is it
So then commaundid she was upon this
To show her book: and she said here it is
The queen of fame to occupacioun.

But mirth and consolacyoun
Made by protestacyoun

why should she take shame
That her goodly name
Honorably reportid
Should be set and sortyd
To be matriculate

And with a venomows arow
Slew of the epidawris
One of the centawris
Or onocentauris
Or hippocentaurus
By whose might and maine
An heart was slain
With hornnis twain
Of glitteryng gold
And the apples of gold
Of hesperides with hold
And with a dragon kept
That never more slepte
By merciall strength
He wan at length
And slew gerione
with three bodies in one
with mighty corrage
A dauntid the rage
Of a lion savage.
Of diomedis stabyll
He brought out a rabyll
Of coursers and roun^is
wit lepes and bounsis
And with mighty luggyng
wrastelynge and tuggyng
He pluckid the bull
By the hornid scull
And offered to cornucopia
And so forth per cecera
Also by hecates power
In plutos ghastly tower
By the ugly cumenides.

In lerua the grekis fen
That was engendered then
By chemeras flamys
And all the dedely namys
Of infernalll posty
where soulis fry and rosty
By the stigiall flode
And the stremes wode
Of cochiros vottumles well
By the feryman of hell

That rowyth with a rude ore
And with his frownsid fortop.

In ye name of king saull

To witch craft her to dres
And by her abusiouns
And damnable illusiouns
Of marvelous co^clusiouns.
And by her supersticiouns
Of wonderful condiciouns

Samuel that was deed
But whether it were so
He were idem in numero

How be it to saull he did tell
The phillistimis should him askry
And the next day he should dye
