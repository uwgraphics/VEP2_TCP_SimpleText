FINIS.
FOr as much, as God which is the beginning of all Creatures, (good gentyle
reader) has made man to his own similytude and lykenes, whereby he is almost
comporable to the holy Angels of god, who is it then, that will deny that man
may by the disposition of the stars, prognosticate things to come, as
(Becolus Chaldeus writes that holy Noe did unto Armenians and Sethians after
the universal deluge or floude, wherefore they called him the partaker of the
mind of God. Moreover S. Hierome, writes, that what soever can be
comprehended with humayne understanding is ruled by the wheles of the Sun.
wherefore in as much as both the dyuine, and the Prince of Philosophers,
Aristotle in his book (de generatione, et corruptione) confesses that
(propter accessum, et recessum solis in curculo obliquo fiunt generationes, et
corrupsiones in mundo sublunati.) It follows that knowing the disposicion of
the celestial bodies, by the which all ementate bodies be ruled, that we men
may by the science of Astronimy (which science Petrus Caneracentis calls
worthily natural theology (prognosticating as is aforesaid things to come,
as mutacions of the air, pestilencis, and al other infirmities, war, penury,
peace, or plenty of victuals, which depend of the heavens, as second causes
of God, to such effects appointed, wherefore (good gentyl reader) the
premysses being well pensed, I desire the not to take all things that shall
be Prognosticated in this years Prognosticacion as contigences of fatal
necessity, but that it shall chance, if God do not forbid, thus I bydde thee
well to fare.
