A Farewell cauld, Churcheyeards, round. From the Court to the Cuntry grownd.
IN Court if Largies be
why part I thens so bare
if Lords were frank and fre
Su^ dradg would Lordings spare
To hyme whose tongue and penn
Might show in every cost
The worthynes of men,
And who desaruythe most.
Full lyttill may be got
Where hungry drops do fall
Where all goes to the pott
The kitchine fese ar small
The Bird can spare no plumes
That feathers gaye would have
The Courttyer all consumes
who makes hyme self so brave
No no here lies in deed
The padde within the straw
For each man pledithe neade
And he is held a dawe,
That gyues to such as want
And thynkes hyme self in lack
This makes the world so skant
And tournythe all to wrack.
For fryndshype cowlde as Ise
I waited long and late
And glad to play the vice
To pleasure each estate
And ever did I hope
To hitt my wysshyd mark
yet lo I did but grope
For gnats within the dark
Parhappes the froste has nypt
Each Noble lyberall hand
Or ellse a way is skypte
In to sum other lannde
God send a thawe a gain
And ships draw home as fast
That pore men for there pain
May find sum welthe at last
I saught the Prince to sarue
As all our duties is
And hope I did desarue
A greter suit then this,
But days and wekes are spente
And worn my cotes full thine
And all my yearly rent
yet found no grace therein.
No Monstoure sure I am
Nor fowlle deformyd thing,
No sheep nor suckinge lame
More lycke to sarue a King,
As shall both hand and heart
At length my wytnes be,
When proffe in any part
Shall be requyrde of me.
Had I but found a wight
In Court when I was there,
The Lady Sydney hight
All changed had been this gere,
what happ had I to shue
Where no such help is found,
O dames yt blushe not you
Thought she in grace a bound,
Now from the Court to carte
My horse and I must pase,
Who has the meryst heart
Who is in better case
My horse or I, God knows,
The one must bear his charge
The other where he goes
Must pourely live at large.
Finis.
quod, T. Churcheyeard.
