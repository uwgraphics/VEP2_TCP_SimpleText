A form how we shall know God.
THe effect of holy scripture co^sistyth chefly in two partis / That is. In
knowledge of God and owre selves. We shall know God four mannere of ways.
First if we pryntyt in owre hertes by a certain faith / God to be ynfynitte
wysbdam / rightwysnes / goodness / verite / vertw and lyffe / and wha^ soeuere
these vertws er seen or don in any place / to be only of him / and of none
othere / as all miracles / and preseruacyons of mean and of al things that is
good. We must only ascrybe to God and to no saint / othere in heaven or earth /
as meny do. ygnora^tly for lake of this knowledge. Baruch. 3. Jacob. 1.


The secunde way to knouwe God / is to believe all thyngis. Prouer. 1^ Psalm.
148. Danie. 3. Roma. 1.
Which er in heuyne and in earth / to be creatyde in his glory / and that each
creature owghte to serve him by right. by the reason of their creacion / and
nature / also they must ynspecte his co^maundment / obey his mayeste / and
knowledge him in obayunge / to be theyere lord and king.

Thurdly we must confess him to be a ryghtuse youge / and therefore shall
revenge Psalm. 7. Roma. 2.
strayghtly in them which declyne from his co^mau^dime^tis / Which do not obey
his will by all thingis / which shall think / specke / or do any thing else
then those which pertayne to his glory / and honor. Roma. 2.
Forthly we must co^sydere / that he is merciful and meke / and to resayue
mercy fully synneres and wreches / which do draw to his mercy / and apprehende
his faith / always ready to forgive if any do are forgenesse / to suckure if any
do insta^ly deseyre his help / to save if any will return and fire their holl
trust in him. Psalm. 103. Iesa. 55. Psalm. 25 and. 85.


A form to know owre selves.
WE shall know owre one persons thus / We owght to co^sydere owr first
fathere Adam / to be created to the image and simylitude of God / that is in
wysdam / rightwysnes / indude with holiness / and so cleuynge to God by these
geftis of grace / should euere live in him / if he had perseuerid and stand
suerly in this clernes of nature / which he took of God. But after he was
corrupt in sin / this image and simylitude of God was seducte and blottyd.
Gene. 1.
he lost all goodness of godly grace / by which he Gene. 3.
might aperseueryd (if he hade willyd) in the way of trute / and lyffe. By syne
he is deuydyd fare from God and made a nothere mane / robbyd and spowilide of
all wyssdam / rightwysnes / vertwe and lyffe / Which he ca^ne not have but only
of God. Roma. 5.
Wherefore nothing else is left to man / but ygnorau^ce / iniquite / wekenes /
death / and yougmente / which aer the fruttis of sin / Which calamyte did not
fall only in him but is shede also in them that cum of his seed / Therefore all
men which erborne of Adam terrestrial / aer ygnoraunte and void of God /
peruers / corrupt / and destitute of all goodness / Owre thowght word and ded
ever a genste godis will / although we show sum goodness in form /
nevertheless the same inwerde affection of the mende abydith in his fylthynes /
and blind peruersite / The yougmente of which mende or heart / partayn only
to God / which letyll regard the owght werde shynynge / but only be hold the
secrets of the heart. Iere. 17.
Therefore let a man have of him selffe never so bowtyfull a face consernyng
holiness / it is nothing else but hypocrisy / and before God also abomynacion /
by cause living inflesse peruers cogitacions of mind and corruptible deseyrs
be ever in man. 1. Reg. 16. Iere. 17.


ALthowgh truly we be so borne / that there is nothing left in us to do any
thing which is accept or cane be to God / nor is not left in owre vertwe to
pacyfy or to make acceptable to him / never the less / we do not sesse to be
detters in that thing / which we cane not give / or restore / In as much we
be the creaturs of God / and he being all mighty do not sesse to creat / and
conserve us most wrechyd and sinful / therefore er we ever bownde to serve his
honor and glory in knowlegyng his goodness / and owr one infirmyte in obseruyge
his co^maundmentes. Nor it is not lawful to pre^etde an excusacio^ / by cause
faculte or abilyte is absente or lake / and as wast full detters which aer not
abyll to pay. Truly it is owre fawt and sin which hold us bownde that we can
nethere will or may do good. Joan. 8. Roma. 7.
But when God is the yousie reue^gere of syns / it be houythe that we knowelege
owre selves worthy maledictio^ / and to deserve yougmente of eternal death.
Truly there is no^ that wyllith / or may do those thingis which partayne to owre
offece / duty or iustificacion. Wherefore in scripture we er called the childrene
of ire / and condempnacion and youge us all hedlyngis in to death and Ephe. 2.
Roma. 3.
perdicion / Therefore there is nothing left to man / wherein he should seek
his rightwysnes / vertw / lyff / and health in him selffe / which all thingis
aer but in one God / from whom man set a part and deuidide / before him
selffe shall not find / but infelicite / vnabilite / iniquite / death / and the
same hells / that is / the vttermoste malediction for sin / which is the
returninge in to earth / and in to the obliuyusnes of gods blissyngis and
geftis. Osee. 13.


LEft man should be ygnorante of these thyngis / the lord did give / and in
ma^nere prynte in the hertis of all men a law / which is called the law of
nature / This law truly is no^ othere thing thene man's co^schyens / or for
knowledge / which is inwerdely a record to us of those thyngis which we owe
dwely to God / and do show us that which is good and ill / and therefore shall
accuse and hold us gilty / whils we er known to owre selves / not to be (as we
owght) of abilite to make satisfaccion for owre offencis and misdeeds / that is
by owre workis can neuere satisfy or purches again the rightwysnes / vertw / and
lyffe / which aer lost by owr one freewyll. Roma. 2. The caus^ of the nat^rall
law.


The cause of the law of Moses
ANd by cause man after werdes was and is swollen by arrogaunce and pride / and
so blyndide by his one love / that he can not be hold his one selffe / and
descend in him selffe / and to knowledge his one wrechidnes and mysery / the
lord did put to us a law writtyn / by which we er leruyd of the parfecie
rightwysnes which the lord require / and what ma^nere a rightwysnes it is /
and how we shall fulfill it / and that is if we fyxe owr selves growndly and
holly in God / and when in all thingis that we think / deseyre / speak or do
we intend and square it to his honor and glory. And this law writtine do
show to us how fare we be absente from the right way. And for this cause / all
promissis and malediccions er putt in the same law / there truly the lord do
promise / if any shall fulfill it perfectly and eractly by word and deed /
what so ever he command / that he will give the reward of eternal health.
Leuit. 18.
Whereby he show the same perfectnes of lyffe to be the very rightwysnes /
which is towght in the law / and so to be hade before him / and that this
parfection of lyffe were worthy such a reward / if by any men's it might
befownde a monge men. Deuteronomy. 27.
Again he promise malediction in all men / and pronowsyth an eternal iougment
of death / which do not observe plentyusly and with out any exception the hole
rightwysnes / of the law / the which pain / malediction / and co^dempnacio^ do
beynde and subdue all men truly which ever has byne / is / or shall be / to
confess them selves synneres and transgressers of the law / and these thingis
truly we know by the law of Good. Gala. 1.
Wherefore the law whyls it do show and teache us the will of God the which will
to be fulfyllyd we er bowde / and whylis it show that we do very little of
those thingis / which we aer bownde to do pwrly and syncerly / it is truly a
spectacle to us in which we may se the goodness of God and behold wystly owre
sin / and malediction as in a class of stele we be hold the fyllthynes and
spottis of owre mouth / And this law is nothing but the testimony of the
natural law which stere and move often tymys owre memory inwerdly / whose
monischio^s now by te law writtyn is incowlkyd and dreuyne into owr hertis /
which before we did not kype faithfully whene the law of nature did teache us
inwerdly. To. 3. and. ^.
Now it is ready to understand what we ought to learn of the law / truly God
to be owre creatore / almighty / lord and fathere. wherefore we owgt to give him
all dwe honor / glory and love. Also ye must notte / by cause we be all the
children of ire / therefore as conseruynge owre syn^fulnes / to be all worthy
malediction / iougme^t / ye at the last eternal death.

When we have thus lernid owr one infirmyte then we must not dispyre vtterlly
/ but seek remidy by his marty / and note by workis / and so he is ready to
help for Christis sak which is his only marcy and remission of sin.
Therefore if we will optayn health it is to by sowght sum othere ways then be
the rightwysnes of workis / which helt is remission of sin. Furthermore when
it is not in owre selves / that is / in owr vertw and faculte to pay that we
owe to the law / we out to dispayrs in owronselues / and to are and lokefore
help sum othere whare. Jacob. 4. 1. Petri. 5.
And when we thus humbyll and meke owre selves in knowleginge owr one infirmyte
and wekenesse / then the lord do a pere to us / and exte^d him selffe aesy /
meke / and forgeuinge / of whom it is written / that he resistyth proud men /
and give grace to meke. If we deseyre first his ire with faythfullnes / and axe
forgiveness / with out dowght he do remitt his ire to us / what so mener owre
sins did deserve he remytt and take us in grace / by whose grace we shall
resayue a owe heart / by which we will / and a ^^we vertw by which we may
execute his vertws. Ezech. 3.
And all this truly he largly imparte (...) distribute unto us / for Jesus
Christ / owre lord / Which when he was on God with te fathere / he did do on
owre flesh / wharby he might begin a cu^nau^te with us / and draw us nere to
God / from whom owre syns did make us fare distaunte. Joan. 1.
Iesa. 53. Ephe. 2. Colos. 1.
Which by meryth of his death did pay owre dettis to the right^^senes of God /
and pacifyde his ire / rede^^ynge us from malediction and yougment^ / to which
we wore bownde / and bore the pain of syn^ in his body that we might be
absoylyd by thesam. He desce^dyd from heaven and brought with him all
plentuusnes of heuynly blissyngis / which he shede in us by a large hand / in
sendynge his holy ghost / by who^ we er regenerate / and deliueryde from the
nowre and snaris of the deuell / we ere optay^^yd by godly grace ynto the
children of God Iod. 1. and. 7 Roma. 8.
and er sanctifyde to every good worlte by whom also how long we aer in this
mortal body / all peruers couyttusues / flessly deseyrs and what else so ever
/ the crokyd / and corrupt peruersyte of nature do generate aer mortifide in
us / by who^ from day to day we ere regenerate / that we might walk in nouite
of lyffe / and live to rightwysnes. All these thingis eroffryd and given in
Christ owre lord / truly remission of sin / by grace only / piece and
reco^syliacio^ with god / the geftis of the holy ghost / if we do amplecte and
take them by a certain faith / and thereby cleue to the goodness of God / and as
men resting and nothing doughtinge / but that the word of God is veryte and
truth / which do promysese to us all those thingis / and thus yowynnyde to him
do possess all heavenly blyssingis / tresurs / and gestis goostly / which shall
led us in to lyffe and health / which we shall never optayn but by a lively and
a true faith whyllis we confess all owre goodness to be in him / we truly to be
nothing but in him / and for certente we must asucre / and promysse to owre
selves / in him to be made the children of God / and partakers of the kyngdam
of God. To. 3. and. 5.
Joan. 1. Roma. 8.
Again they which have not the fa^^^^e in Christ / of what degree so ever they
be / what so meuer they do or go a bought / is to their perdicion and
confusion / and iougment of eternal death abiecte from God / and excludyd from
the acceptacion of all health. Joan. 3. 1. Iou^. 5.


And wha^ this cognyschio^ of owre selves (by which we er tought to humbyll and
cast downde owre selves before God a^de to seek his marcy / also this says
which give us the taste of the godli goodness / and mercy / by which he worket
with us in his Christ) is not of us / or put in owre faculte / god is to be
prayed that he do bring us by a trwe repentance / in the same knowledge of owre
selves / and with a ferue^te faith in this knowledge of his mercyfulnesse / and
swettnes / which he show in his Christ / that he being gyde / we may be l^^e
unto the eternal beatitude / which christ i^ the vnical way / whereby we cum to
the fathere. Iere. 3^.
And that men which ere simple may the better know the cu^myunge in to this
way of truth / we shall declare the co^maundme^tis of the law / which (as I
showde before) do dreue us to Christ / in knowlegynge the goodness of God and
owre one naughttynes / and hew all grace / marcy / and remission of sin is
only optaynyd by a suerfayth in Christis blude.

Here begynnyth the ten commaundmentis.
THere aer ten preceptis of the law / four partayn to Godis honor / and. vi.
to the love of owre nayghbore / Wherefore the Lord (as the Eua^gelyst
testifyth) did conclude brefly the laue in two preceptis / That we should love
God with all owr hertis / all owre mendes / and all owre strenkyth / owre
nayghbore as owre selves / But althowgh the universal law is concludyd in
those too chappiters / never the less owre Lord whereby he might take a way the
pretense of excusacion / it plesyd him to show more largly and plainly by ten
preceptis both those thyngis which partayne to his honor fare / and love / as
those which he command us for his sake to bear to owre nayghbores. Exo. 32. and
34. Deuteronomy. 10.
The first is this. Leuit. 10


The first co^maundment.
Thou shall not have strange Godis before me.
BY which we ere co^maundyde to have a steadfast faith / and tho seek all ways
remydy of him that we do not give the laud of any goodness and vertw / to a
nothere Iesa. 30. and. 31. 1. Tim. 1. Deute. 6. and. 10.
^reature / which belongyth only to him / It be houe us also to love and fere
him a boue all thing / that we knowledge him only for owre God / fyxynge all
owre hope and trust in him / thinking what so ever goodness chau^se to us to be
of him / admittynge at notime any thing but that in which he is worshyppyd /
and honoryde. 1. Cor. 10
Nor we out not to declare him thus by tongue / gesture of body and ^y every
owtworde singnyficacion / that is ^o be owre God / but also we must give owr
selffe like by mende / heart and all owre stody. 1. Pat^. 28
For not only owr wordis and external deeds aer before him / but also the
workis of the deep heart and cogitacio^s of the inwerde mende / er mor better
and clearly opinyde to him thene owre selves. And ye shall not that there was
^euer / is / or shall be any man (Christ any ^^cepte which is both God and man)
that ^^er fulfillyd this co^maundime^te / which low God with all his mind /
heart and soul. Nottywtstandynge he do give us this commaundment vnpossibyl
for us to fulfill in this mortal body / by cause he would dreue us to Christ /
that is (as I told you before) to confess owre one infirmyte / and remission
of sin to be had only by his marcy and grate. This co^maundment teache us
whylis we walk in this corrupt flesse that we er not perfeyt / and willyth
that we streche owre selves forwerdis to the mark and gole by a true faith /
where we shall resayue all parfectues / and se God face to face / owre sauyore
Christ Jesus being owre mean and gyde. This co^maundme^t stope the mowghte of
bosters and crakers reioysyng in workis / and dreue all men to seek owre sauyre
Christ Jesus.

By this co^maundme^te we er forbydyne to prefere any worldly goodis or
promocions / as rychese / honor / dingnyte and sych othere above God / we may
not set owre mend so on them that we shall forgytte God. But froz time to time
we must ever knowledge him / as is said before.

The secund co^maundment.
Thou shall make no grauene image / or similytude of those thyngis which aer
above in heuyne or in earth benethe / or in waters which ere under the earth /
thou shalt not honor ne worshope them.
BY which is syngnifyde all honor and worshope to be long to on God / which
when he can not be co^prehe^dyd by nomens of man's capacyte or wytt / in as much
he is incorporall inuysyble / so spirytall that he cane be excludyde from no
place / let not us flowmbere that we can comprehe^de him by owre one wyttis
and ymaginacio^s. Deuteronomy. 6.10. 3. Reg. 8. Joan. 1. 1. Timo. 1. Joan. 4.
Nor let not us worshope an ydol* as it were the similytude of God which is a
spryte / and wylbe worshippyd in spryte and truth. Therefore the ^^rst
commandment do show one Good to be / be side whom there is non othere God to
be thougt or hade. This co^maundmente do teache what manner a God he is / and by
what kind or manner of worshype he wylbe honoryde / lest we shuldebe bold to
feign any carnal thing like to him / or to cast him under owre wyttis and
brains / or to be reprehendyde by any form / or symilytude.

A ge^st ydolis of the trinyte and saints.

LLett them respect hethere which intend to defend by a miserabyll pretense
execrabyll ydolitre / by which meny yers be for this time / true relygion have
bynue overthrown / and submersyde. They say ymagis aer not reputyd as Godis.
Nor the Iuys were not so obliuyus but that they remembryd God to be / by wose
hand they were led out of Egypt / before they made the claffe. Nor Turkis er
not to be though so dulwyttyd / but that they do believe God to be a nothere
thing then stone and wodde. They do chonge allways ymagys after their on
fancy / but they hold all ways in mend their God / and dedycatt meny ydolis in
the name of on false God / but do not believe to have so meny Godis / as they
have ydolis / Also they do make uwe every day / but they do not think to make
nwe Godis. What now? All ydolyters of Iuys or gentelis / had a believe God to
be such a wone as the vanyte of their brayn did co^sayue. Therefore the mende
did generate an ydolle / and a hand brought it forth / nevertheless the Iuys
did think them selves to worshope under such ymagys God eternal / on and very
Lord in heaven and earth / Also gentyls did so repute their godis (altough
fallis) which also they feigned to be in heuene. To this they did not believe God
to be present to them / except they did show him by a carnal presence / And
that they might obey this blind deseyre / they did erecte signys / and ydolis /
by which they did believe to have God present before their corporal eyes / When
truly they though them selves to be hold God in them / then they worshoppyd him
in them. And so beholding ydolis with mende and eyes as meny christyans do
noweadays / they begene to be more bestly then holy / inthinkynge holy that
which is a ydoll. He that will deny this to be done before owre days and also
now he denyth the truth onshamfastly. Why do they ly prostrate before them:
Why do they turn themselves to them intending to pray as to the aerys of God:
Why aer they ready for such popyttis and ydollis to stryues / debatis /
brawlyngis and chyding is as gentels be for their ma^myttis? Meny now a days
wylsoffere more willing on God to be takyne a way then their ydolis and
poppetis having besydis this meny othere gross accors with out nu^bere / by
which God grettly is dysplesyd / but shulbe grettly plesyde if they purifyde
themselves / from ydolytre and such yllis. They say we do not call them Godis /
no more did the Iuys or gentyls call them but only singnys and ymagis of Godis.
Iesa. 40. Iere. 2. Ezech. 6.
And truly all prophetis and holy scripture do not self to forbid fornications
with wode and ston / where all Christyans (which er the true Iuys) er in
excusabyll as concerning the carnal worshyppynge of God in wode and stone /
or any othere erthely thing. Haba. 2. Deuteronomy. 32.
And ye shall not that the vttermoste effuge and escape that all papistis have
to uphold their ydolis / is to affirm them the bokis of ydiotis and lay man.
And that we grante this (although it be a thing most folysh and vayn when they
er set vpe with out dowte for non othere cause then to be worshypyde) hit
never the less I can not se what fcuttis they bring to ydiotis and onlernyd
persons / chefly when God is caruyd to them / but to make them heritykes in
beleuynge to have God present all hole by menbers / as they carue and paynte
him. The carnynge of God make herety kis. The carnynge of fayntis make bawdis.
And such ymagis as present fayntis / what er they but examples of grett
superfluyte / costloste and a tityll of an ill name: Fore harlottis do show
more shamfastly and moderattly / their horly a ray and owtwerd ostencions /
then tempils do their picturs which they will to represente the ymagis of
virgyns. Therefore let them deck their ymagis at the lest ways / with su^
shamfastnes / that they might represente sum what mor shamfastly to be bokis of
sum holiness. As they be mad now a days / they shall provoke a man mor to syne
them vertwe. But as towchynge they re opynion ymagis to be bokis of ydiotis is
not the way and reason to teache the pepell of God / whom God will to be
instruct by a nothere techynge and by a nothere book / then by the bockis of
blockis and stokis and folysh lies / and fabyllis. To make ymagis bokis is not
the true way teache ydiottis.
He has showde the prechynge of his word to be a co^myn docteyn to all men /
to be a bocke which shall teache us only the way of truth. Therefore to what end
do it perteyn to set up so meny crossis of wode / ston / if that thing be often
times betynne in owre aeris / Christ to be betrayed for owre syn^s / and that he
sofferyd owre malediction a pon the cross / and did wash a way owre syns / of
which on word they may learn more then of a thowsante crossis of wode or
stonne / much less then need crossis of gold and silver / which shall make a
couyttus mend more to remenber Mammon then Christ. Not the great ydolie of the
world.
Othere Idolis there be in the world which er mor grette mor abomynabyll then
these foresaid / which ascend into the trone of God / and boste themselves to be
like the all mighty. Agenst which who so specke the ypocritys and popysche
sort se them condempnyd to death / which ever have byne a geuste Good / both in
old and now Testament in sleynge profyttis and true discipyls which spoke the
true word of God / intendyng to pluck down them with their ydolis resting
in godis place / as men utterly intendyng to expulsse God / ye and their
malesse was so grett that they did not spare the son of God / whom the
te^porall yugis would have deliueryd. Truth deseruith euere has.
Wherefore though in spekinge the trothe death must nedis follow by the ha^dis of
these blowde suckers / hit the truth must be prechede yet Christ must be
extollyd of them that knowythe the truth / For he that deny him (as he wyttnes
him selffe) before men / he will deny him before his heavenly fathere / Wherefore
cheryte compellyth me to tell truth as consernynge ydolis contrary to this
co^maundment. And ye shall not that a monge all ydollis which er in this
world with tryumphe in the set and tro^ue of God allmighty. that is / which
rest by a falsse faith in the heart of man which heart is the set of God / is
popysche prestode / and his grett Good / For popysche prestode what by
hypocrisy / and by the falsse presence The ydoll of prestode popysch.
of mastershyue which he hold under their veno^mus Good / has so infecte by
their desaytfull promyssis / the hertis of pepyll / that whare Christ was wont
to rain with his swett promyssis / by their poppytres they have clearly
erpulsyd him / and extollyde Antychriste with his marchantis babylonicalle /
And when prestode popysche with his falsse god thus supplyth the place of God /
what er they but ydollis: ye and so meny as believe to be ydolaters: Let us
sherch what an ydolle is and we shall find the thing clerly verifyde of them.
The defynischion of an ydole.
An ydoll truly is nothing in the thingis of nature / that is / altowgh it
express any thing as all ydollis do. othere God / angel / saynth / deuel /
son / mon / best or such / like / it ere they but ydollis. And why: by cause
they have noparte of the substance and properte. Not with standing hit an
ydolle is so plainly expreste by color and byce / that a folle shall respect
it as the thing / and hit it have no properte of the natural thing. This
consyderinge what ydolle shall you find mor less representynge the substance
/ more mysusynge the properte of nature then popysche prestode? They claim the
substance of God that is to make Christ / and to remytt sin / and it in all
properies they er like the deuell. And this false substance / this their
detestabyll ydoll of popysche prestoude / is so craftyly payntyd / and set out
by blasynge colors / that except a man have light of the son of rightwysnes
/ he shall never disterne theverite from falshed / the substance from the
ydoll / There is no payntere so cou^nynge in laynge his colers a pone an ydoll /
as Antychrist is insettinge out of his this ydoll of popysche prestode / The
grown colers that he use be these / oyster gatherers / I would say Ostiares /
whose office is to pute the kay in the dors. and dreue doggis out of the cherche

flesse and bonys / seuene colers he use fore the.vii. gestis of the holy ghost.
Not withstanding sum be not content with these colers / but they add to more
on be fore and a nothere be hynde / that is / Tonsurati. he that is clypte or
shorn in the crown / and Episcopi / he that sleep over his floke / with meny
othere debattis which paynters of this ydoll have as I shall show here after
in his proper place if God grant melyfe. Meny othere colers they have whereby
they set forte this their prestod / as amyssis albys / fanellis / stollis /
and the vestime^t which couere the multitude of sin / and such othere /
whereby they transmutte themselves in to an angel of light and will ascend in
to the hy trone and be like to the allmighty. But although their nawghtty and
rottyne substance be thuse set out by colers / and be made as a God / hit is
it but an ydoll / lakinge the thing and the propertys of the thing / not
having the vertwe of God in remit tynge sin / and in geuynge lyffe. For we
have but on God whom we out to fere and honor with all owre heart / mend and
soul as was said before. And a ge^ne by cause all men do declyne from
righwysues / and there is non that do good but only owre Lord Jesus Christ.
Again by cause all men a^re liars every man is a cursed which trust in men. Now
in asmiche popischyrestode do confess themselves spiritall and all gostly /
sauyers and makkers of Godis / ye and very vicarys of Good / therefore we must
nedis conclude / that they er but ydollis payntyd of Antichrist / by cause they
lake the substance of all godly vertws / whose person they claim by thayre
payntyd ydoll of popysch prestode. This thing herd perchance sum man will say
/ I maruyll then that owre bushops would so plainly and purly wright of this
ordere of prestode / setting forte so every order with a sage grauyte / in as
much owre suppreme head did command them to show that thing which might be
to the most honor of God and profyth of his co^muns. Let no mane meruyll
thowgh they have a snake of their onwyll / that is thowgh they respect their
one profit and glory and mayntyne sum what popyschues / which thowgh it be
nothing fore profit it is it good fore pastyme. ^. Reg. 10
In as much it is all cungerynge and lurgeredemayne / Which thing is
prefiguryd I think verily in the old testamente / where mention is made that
Salomone did send his shyps one in three yers / in to tersys / which brought
gold and silver / and eleuantis tethe / and apes / and pecokis / So owre king
Henry the.viij. whose byfe I pray god to keep / which is a very Solomon / what
is / which is paciente and quiette in conschens / rectifyenge hyme self and
his according to Godis word / which is the life of the fowlle / he by his
nobyll co^sell / has co^maundyde his bushops and docters / to lead his shyps
in to Tharsys and to bring of the best / fruttis and tresurs / that is to lead his cherche of which he is suppreme head imediattly after Christ / into
the contemplacion of Godis promyssis in the sherchynge of owr stony hertis /
which is signifyd by Tharsis / Tharsis whas such a plesaunte co^tre and so
rich / that is was called the contemplacion of yoy / And what is mor yoy full
to behold / then the swette promissys of Christis blude? Tharsy*
In to this laud owre bushops and prechers were sent to veche of the best
tresure and riches / And they have browte part after his co^maundment / part
after their on fancy and brayns. After his commandment they have brought gold
and silver / that is / in sum thing they have instruct their cherches with
the true workis of faith / with the pure word of god which as the profyt
says is a chaste and an vndefylyd speech / gold and silver prouyd by fire. And
after their mendis they have brought elephantis tethe / to make trones and
resting placis / that is / they uphold their on glory and dignyte and maintyne
falsse sectis of antichristis angellis / the pwysone ordere of popysche
prestode / which dewouere the goodis of fatherless and motherlesse children /
Which sectis also is signifyde by the apes / which er bestis of mockege / and
lawghynge more then for profyt or help / which shall be garnischyd with a cott
and bear the similitud of men and yt er but ydolis and apys as towchych the
propertis of man / which cane not specke but moke and mow / as owre popysche
sort do in all their actis and dydis / clayminge the similitude and
substance of Good / and in dedis er but apes / that is a lawinge stoke to owre
Solomon and his true subiectis. Antichriste a his flock er dewouerera.
Popyshnes is but apyshnes.
Popyshers ^eyoys in their tayll as the pecoke.
Which sectis also is signifid by the pecokes / whose pride is in their tayll /
that is in the blind sort of onlernyd pepyll / which hang to theme and trust
to their popysch seremonys / which reyoyce in their workis and operacio^s and
extol themselves as the spectacle or onperlesse flowere of this world / which
pekokis more reyoyce in their taylle / that is / in their workis and blind
folowers / then in their head / and sauyure Christ Ieswe. Therefore I pray God
for the merytis of Christis blude bring this grett ydoll down wytt al his
gynnes and propertes / and send him a scorynge of his colers / that his
substance may a pere as it is in ded / which in ded is but fylthy / sinful
and of no valor. Such things as Christ did use ande institute to his grett
glory / and owr profyth gostly. those have the Pope and his menbres chongyd to
his grett dyshonore / and owre damnacio^ / for he sent them as ministers / but
they make them selves sauyers / gloryfinge themselves to make the secunde
person in trinyte / whom the fathere of heuene culd never make but of him self
generat by whom he is with out beginning or ending. Of their mass God.
By the reason of the which grett ydolytre ye the most gretyst that can be is
don ygnorauntly and for lake of knowledge of meny. In as much the pepyll set
their holle affiaunce and trust in that God / having nothing so much in
their heart / as that God / living or lyenge a departing by death / they
chefly call for sere Ihon and his God / thinking as they er towght that with
out them God have no power to save them / except as they say it be in
necessyte / then they say and grante God may work with out them / but then you
must take hyd / for so God can not do neythere except you have a will to have
S. Ihon and his God / if it wore possible / Ho shame / Thus by this men's they
rauysche the hertes of all men and pluck them clean from God eternal and fyxe
them in their workis and falsse God / affirmyng that thing which Christ did
institute in remembrance to be a thing in ded of the same flesse and blude
borne of the virgyne Mary / and that to be done in saying those words. This
truly is / my body / Again. Mat. 27. The wordie making.
This is my blude of the nwe testament / which shall be shede for meny in
remission of sin / which wordis spokynne with on win over the bred and
win / with a stynkinge brethe at the last end they affirm to be and will
make us be leave the bred and win to be chongyd into the very flesse and blud
of Christ. They believe to blow out the holy ghost out of the fathers bosom /
and to bring with him the holl body of Christ borne of the virgyn and to
consayue it a genne in the cake and wyneas he did in the virgyns womme. This is
their faith if these wordis be spokyn chefly with on brethe / but if they take
two brethes then they er in dowte. And this they worshope as God and will us
also so to do / Hade Christ such a beleu when he spoke these wordis? Did he
command his discipyls to worshope it? Do not they teache also the contrary?
Christ did not so believe nor teache And they sing the contrary daily in thy
mess creed / and prime.
We read in their mass creed / I believe in on Lord Jesus Christ the sone of
God / only begottyn and borne of the fathere before all workis / God of God /
light of light / very God of very God be gottyn and not made / of substance
even like to the fathere / by whom all thyngis be made. Christ is vndemade.
We read also in the Psalm of Nuicunque vult / The fathere God / the son God /
the holy ghost is God / Vnmad is the fathere / unmade is the sone / vnmad is the
holy ghost / Are not these wordis their on song / O wylfull blyndnes / In as
myth these wordis betrue why duste thou boste and affirm to make God and Christ
in flesh and blude / with out whom thou cau^ste not live / move / or be. blude
/ to inherytte heavenly blyssingis for Christis sake only / whose will is fyxid
both day and night in the laue of owre lord to fulfill it spiritally in
Christ. Them if he be faithful which do believe thus / It must nedys follow
that they er infydeles which do the contrary. And so they which have not this
believe in Christ / but uphold Antychrist and popyschnes / truly they must
nedys be infydels / and so nethere to make Christis body in spekinge his wordis
/ or to ette him. The instytucion of Christ.
The we answer / that they ca^ue do more then Christ would do / Christ did
institute his supper. in remembrance of his death / to be a sign and mystery
of his swett promissis / stablisshyd and fulfyllyd in his blude / whose sign /
remembrance / and sacrament / is the brekynge of bread and shedynge of win
annexyde to his will and testimony of the same Christis body and blude onse
shede for owre redempcio^ on his proper autere / and now to be vsyd of The
brekige of bred / and shedynge of wine is a sell annexyde to the lordis
testamente.
them that be faithful (Christ co^mau^ndynge (for remembrance of this his
death paste / whereby owre weke co^schience may be strenghtyd and stablisshyd in
this faith and promissis foresaid. The use of the popisch sort.
Popysche prestode do not use this sacrament as a remembrance but as a thing
renwede / and made a genne by their wordis and blissyngis / and so whare the
Iuys did crucify him ons / they like cruel tyrantis do crucify him daily / and
whare Judas (confessinge his fault) for a little lukere did be tray his blude /
they vnrepentau^te by cause they have grett vantege will ever be sellers / and
trayters to Christis blude. They say after the blowynge of their mouth (as I
said before) the bread being bread is then chongyd and made the very body of
Christ / really and substauncially. And then if he be there really (as they
say) it is no thing of remembrance no sign or sacrament / but the self
substance / the self thing. The popisch Christ is Antichriste.
But not well and with good cheryte / If they can make that thing which is
bread and win / and shall perysch and have an end / to be that thing which
is Christ and ever shall be with out corrupcion / it must nedis follow / this
Christ mad of them in sayng the foresaid wordis / to be Antichrist and not the
son^e of God / by cause he is daily mad and daily perysch as we may se be
expedience. For let them keep their Christ long inform of bred or win /
and their God their Christ shall stater full of worms and stynke / nor cannot
help him selffe / are / or have help of his makers and cungerers / but by the
daily dewouerynge of teth and belly. Owre Christ is the sone of Good.
But owre christ in whose remembrance we break the bread and drink the win
/ deed never see corrupcion by the conseruacion of his co^sayuer the holy ghost
/ the psalmiste saying / He was not left in hell / that is / he was not left
ded in earth which is the uttermost malediccion for syn. nor his flesh did
not se corrupcion. Psalm. 13. Act. 2.
O iniquite most sinful / that they should thus prefere that falsse god and in
hau^syt abowe all that is said god / or that is worshypyd / so that he syttyt in
the temple of God and showyth him felffe as if he were god. Now whothere owre
clargy be gylty in this thing / youge you that be lernyd. For they say wha^
they have said / This is mi body / which they call wordis of co^secracion / or
else of making / which said they say there is no bread left / but it is the
body of owre lord / and there is nothing left but a hepe of accidental
thyngis / as whyghtnes / rowndnes / sauer / touching and sychotere / which if
it be so / then that thing which to day is not shall be God to morowgh / and
that thing which is with owte spryte or lyffe / groynge in the fylde by kind
shall be God anothere year / which God we confess to be with out beginning or
ending / and in his manhede begottyn / and not made / as scriptur testifyth.
Math. 1. Luc. 1. Ebre. 1. Psalm. 19.
For if his manhede were mad and incresyd daily to the quantyte of their bread
and win which they spend daily in that use / he should were in on day be cart
lodis more then he did in.xxxiij. yers when he was here in earth.

But to be short if any makyt in these wordis / This is mi body / he must be
person of Christ or else their is a false God / if it be the prystis body it is
the body of a falsse lostell / a dronke^ man / a theffe / a lecherere or of some
othere synnere / and then there is vnclen body / for any man to worshope for
God. If it be any flesh and blude it must nedis be the prystis body / fore in
all holy scripture from the beginning of Genesis to the end of the Apocalypse
/ there be no wordis writtyne of the making of Christis body / but there be
writtyne that Christ was the son of the fathere / consayuyd of the holy ghost
/ took flesh and blude of the virgin Mary and that he did and a rose again from
death the therde day with out corrupcio^ / and that he asce^dyd in to heue^s
very God and man / and that we should believe in all scripture that is wryttyn
of him / and that he is to cum to Judge both quyke and ded and that the same
Jesus Christis king and sauyure / lord and makere of all thingis as is showde
in Genesis. Gene. 1.
and if popysch prestod can not make that he made visibill and inuisibyl / with
all othere thing wordly having the wordis that he made the^ with / how should
he make then Christ Jesus of a piece of bread or of a drawght of win / of
whom they er made / and with owte whom they cane not live / move / or be / Mor
over you have no word of actorite this to do but as you have fur gyde of your
on hedis as you have don all othere thyngis contrary to Godis law. God / which
is in veryte and truth / and with the lordis supper as ye shall know here after

in as much / they make an ydoll suply Godis presence which he did institute in
remembrance / by cause they would have us worshope a creature in sted of the
makere. Danie. 9
We answer that it is no meruyll / that God will have / and suffere to his
grett honor. For we read in the old testament how there was an ydoll a monge
the Babylony this whose name was Bell / this ydoll did the king worshope daily
/ in offering much flowere / win and sheep / supposyng that ydoll to ett all
that daily for the love of his worshyppers / ontyl Danyel did shoue him it was
an ydolle and no living god / and then when the king had prouyd the truth by
Danyels counsel / and fownd his wordis true and the prystis work and wordis
falsse / then he did put the ydoll to Danyelis iugme^te / and did sle the
prystis which in numbere were lx. and.x. beside wives and children. Therefore no
meruel thowgh owr forne fathers be desayuyd / for why they had not Danyell with
them / that is / they had not the iugment of God printyd in their hertis /
they had not the knowledge of his verite by which they should leren to humbyll
them selves to his ryghtwysnes and iugment and learn to are his mercy / they
did worshope Bell / that is / did believe old tradicions / popystical laws and
sectis / they believed in ydolis / which as I said be for ar nothing in the
thingis of nature / but workyng clean a genst all natural thing / ever
following their one fancy / which flowth and ebbeth after their on will /
making a thing good when they will / But now that owre king Henry the.viij.
whose lyffe I pray Good long to continue / have Danyell with him ye and printyd
in his heart let not us dowt / but that his grace shall put this foresaid Bell
to the judgment of Danyell that is godis word which shall dystry him by the
spryte of his mowght / And as for Belis prystis his grace shall sle / which do
deuowere daily innumerabyl / mell / and wine / and sheep / that is under the
falsse pretense of this falsse ydole foresaid / do deuowere meny simpyll sowlis
spiritally / and cause meny to fare herdly corporally / by their sum Daniel
signyfyth the iugment of god / or knowledge of his verite.
Bell signifyt old tradicide and ceremonye.
Owr prince have Daniell with him and he shall dystry false Antychristes do
Daniel the grettydolis
tuus / and ydyl profeschion that they thowe owtwerdly. Wherefore as towchyng the
destruction of these to ydolis / let us al daily pray the will of owre lord to
be fulfyllyd / and to save his true minyster owre suppreme head ymmediatly under
Christ king Henry the viii. and owre nobyle prince Edwerd his son / with all
his nobyl counsel. But ye shall not that the lord whereby he might declare
more plainly how grettly he abhoryt al infidelyte and ydolitre / did ade to
these two command me^tis / him self to be owre lord God / strong and loving
/ which visyth the iniquite of fathers a ponne the sons in the third and
fowrthe generation / in those which hate his name / nevertheless / he do marcy
in thowsantis / to them which love him and keep his preceptis / As who say / I
am your God me you shall fare and love / to me only you shall eleue / if ye
believe and worshope any othere God beside me / I shall revenge that sin from
time to time / but shall show marcy and benyngnite perpetually to them which
love me / and keep my co^maundementis / that is in knowlingynge owre on
infirmite and inclenynge only to his mercy.

The third co^maundment.
Thou shall not take the name of the lord God in vain.
Whose sense is this. In as much God out to be faryd and louyd of us (as we heue
showde before) therefore we may not abuse his holyname / but must magnifyit a
bow al thingis / and also glorify it / in all thingis / as well in welght as
woe / and so only seek him with all owr mende / geuyng thankis to him for all
thingis which chance from his hand. Fordermore we must keep owre selves besyly
from all his co^tumely and blassemy / we may not name or speak otherwich of him
then becumyth his hy mayeste. Also we may not use his holy name / in other uses
/ then in those which he will to be borne / for that is to his grett dishonore
and polutyng of his name. Wherefore (as meny clerks say) by this commandment
is forbydyne / necromancy / co^geringe of deuellis / with othere sych which God
for bid to be vsyd / by cause they dishonore his blyssayd nam. But why will not
they nu^bere with the foresaid thingis / their sayntifyd marchauntis and
congeracions / as off myghtters / ryngis / crosyersiaues / and with all othere
robys / with out which they thing them selves no bushops / also the
congeracions which they use in making of popysch prystis in sharyng / putting
on of vestme^tis / and in their uwyntingis in haloynge of bellis / cherchys of
stone / chapels / auters / superaltarys / with meny othere things whereby the
honor of Godis name is more dishonoryd / then by the foresaid congerers / for
they use their art preuily with fare lest they shuldbe courrecte getting
their lyuinge contrary to Godis commandment but popyssche prestod with the
holl sort of Antichriste do not get their lyuinge only falsely by their
congeracions greatly dishonerynge Godis name / but also they subdwe by their
craffe the holy name of God and live by opyne robry / in shedinge off
innocents blude / ye as I said before boste them selves as God. Popysch
blyssynges is cu^gery^ge.
Popische^er worsse then cungerere.
But ye shall not and welmarke that the eternalle veryte can not be dishonoryd
more greuusly than whane a wyttnes of falshede is callyde to testify of his
glory and name. As consernyng iuramentis / oaths / and wous / how greuuslly is
the name of God dishonoryd of the selfsame linege / which promise meny hy
thingis as mean grettly regarding Godis honor and hytt did the Iuys never
more dishonore to his name / then they do. The Iuys were blind / but they se
and will not se. First let us begin with owre horly fathere Pope / and so
descend to sere Ihon singyl sowll / or sere Antony laklatyn / and take of

Owr horly father Pope how dewoutly do he swear and bind him selffe by his
office / to be true in confessinge the name of the trinyte / being crownyd
with.iij. crowns which he take in tokyne of the same oath / but how justly do he
keep this iurame^t when in all his actis he claim the office of owre sauyure /
and use him selffe as no confesser / but as a sauyure to the great dishonore of
the trinyte in asmych he distry the merytis of Christis blude which is owre
only salvation / and health.

What think you by sere Antony laklatene / which take a pone him to prech and

Ye but what say ye to sere Ihon singyl soul / which will socke Christ out of

Now all these thingis consyderinge / we may se how grennsly the name of God
is blasphemyd by their yuramentis and false oaths / under the pretense of
Godis glory / when their ynspeccyon is only in thyre belly and nothing in the

which out to usurp any trwe oath or yurament / but that the glory of God and

They popischers do not only blaffeme the name of god by their oaths and

By this commaundment we may not usurp any oath by owre proper and private

Every man is fubdude to these hyer powrs as Peter testifyt saying / be ye
subyecte to every huma^ creature for God other to the king as most ercellent /
or to the dukis as of him sent / to the vengaunce of ill doers / to the laud
truly of God doers / A ducke properly is called a leder / gyde / or dyrecter.
And ye shall not that a Chrystyn king / may not only prouyd gydis for a
polytyke order / but also for a spyrytall order / wherefore he has power to
ynstytute gydis of diverse vocacio^s / which gydis then er bownd to use them
selves according to their vocacio^. The polytical rulers to use their officis
with mercy and justice / that is in maytenyng the good / and correctynge the
ill. The apostolical minysters / and dyaconicall sent of them to use their
office with all truth and humylyte / so shynyng with word and deed that all
men might glorify the heavenly fathere in heaven in following their doctrine and
good living. The Pope has byne euere against the Christ of Good.
And ye shall not that by these forsayde wordis / ye may persayue the Pope and
his sect has long dishoneryd his name / in kepinge true hedis under his

(as owre sauyure Christ do co^mau^d and did being a child and a man as it is
plain in scripture) where learn he this pride and whare has he his auctorite to
claim and hold his primacy over all the world? Luc. 2. Math. 9.
Truly he has it of the world and deuell / This herd perchance sum papist
will say / that I speak agenste cherite / by cause he took his auctorite by
counsente of the cherche / grett Constantyne being Emporore of Rome / as the
scripture of the cherche do testify. Two scripturs.
To this I answer / that there is two scripturs / that is / the scripture of
God and scripture of man / the Lordis is immutabyl / and dampnabyl to the
brekers / man's is mutabyl and not dampnabyl to the brekers / the on that is
Godis must nedis be. the othere if it wornet it wore the better. The scripture
of God is so necessary that it can not be augmentyd ne mynischede (as scripture
testify) with out dampnacio^ of body and soul / The scripture of mane is
mynischyd and augmentyd every day after the ymaginacion of ma^s brain / which
not kept puryfyth the soul / bet often times brings death to the body / of
which scripture Polle bid us take hyd / calling it the doctrine of deuels and
falfs antichristis / wherefore to this false scripture christen men ere not
bownde / but to the scripture of God ye and we must keep al thyngis that er
wryttne there in with all the possibilite that we can / for in it is wrytting and
showde althyngis necessary for owre redempcio^ / according to the prophicy of
the holy ghost spekinge by the psalmiste of the spiritual Syon / that is of the
true speculacion of God and his Christ / saying. The Lord shall show /
understand all thyngis pertayninge to his true honor of his Christ / in
scripturs of pepyll and princes which have byne in it in the true
contemplacion of Godis word / and that is the old Testament and nwe / he say
not / The Lord shall show in the scripturs of pepyll and princis that now be
in Syon / but in the scripturs of them that hate byne / in it. Therefore by
chause we er co^maundyd in meny placis of scripture to obey owr princis / and
can find in no place the Pope / therefore we may affirm al kyngis with their
ministers to be the true elect hedis under God / the Pope and his sect to be
very ennymes of the crose of Christ very Antichristis agenst God and name.
Scripture comman^de us to obey owrekynge but not the Pope.
Therefore let all men be obedient to their princis / and we in special to
owre king Henry the.viij. most excelente and faithful myke paciente and mercy
full / being a moge us (as the Lord command) as on of us / always willing
and co^maundinge that thing in his cherche and subiectis / which is to the
glory of God and Jesus Christ / always co^mau^ding that which is to the
commoune and not to his proper welthe / but god knows he has meny a slow
workere in fulfylling this his will. Agene how marcyful he is agenst his
rebellers. What stody what pain do his grace take daily to set forte God
glory? In what ieberdy and hate is he of the world for the love of Godis
word? Othere kyngis take stody to incresse their subiectis with riches
worldly. Our king do not incresse his co^mou^s with worldly riches only / but
also and chefely with the word of God which is better then gold and precyuus
stons. What infideles would rebel and be false agenst such a prince having the
qualitys and vertws that he has? we out therefore to be true and loving to him
and his / by nature and kind / ye and much more by the laue of God / by the
which law also he has bowde us / ye and we have all sworn in the holy name
of owre lord God to be true to him and his laufull hayers / to the grett glory
of Godis name and tranquilite of his reme. Therefore to co^clud let all men take heed unto their oath / which every man may laufully use (as Paul did) in
affirmyng the dignite of the gospelle and glory of Godis name / and let them
instruct their children in time of youte / that they may laerne to know God
and their Prince / and no more to be blyndly led as they have byne a fore
this time / in rebelling agenst their Prince. Roma. 1.
By this commandment also we er bownde to call a pone non othere name when
necessite shall compel / but a pon the name of Good / for it pertayn only to
his glory / that he be had an vnicall wyttnes and record of verite / which is
the vnical and eternal health and verite. we er bownde to swear only by God
for the trwth.
Therefore a way with owre ladyse bedysmen / Augustinis / Dominickis / Benedictis
Fra^ciscans / Basylighttis / the.v. discordis of the cherch as Tomystis do say
/ a way with these and all other sectis the dropingis of the deuylis tayll / the
vpholsters of Antichrist the son of perdicion / And that he might the better
inculke to us this commandment did add these wordis / that he would revenge
him selffe agenst all them which did take his holy name in vain.

The fowrth co^maundment.
Remember the Sabott day / that thou sanctify thesam / sex days thoue shalt
work / and shall do all thy besynes / the.vij. day is the Sabott day of the
lord God / Thou shall do non of they works / thou and thy son / and
dowghter / thy servant and handmayd / thy best and pylgram which is in thy
portis / For in.vj. days thy Lord did make heaven and earth / the sea and al
thyngis gis which er in them / and the.vij. day he did rest / therefore he did
blyssyt and sanctify the same.

THe obseruacion of the Sabott day do pertayn also to the honor and worshope
of God / in as much it is contaynid under the first tabyl and is nominate the
sanctificacion of the day / Wherefore God did require never nothing more
strayghtlye to be kept / And when he would signify by Prophettis al religion
subuerst / and good lyuinge set part / he did ever say his holydays to be
polutyd / on halowyd / vyolatyd / not kept / not sanctifyd / as thowght this
obedience omittyd and left / nothing remaynyd be side / in which he might be
honoryd. Exodus 31. Nume. 15.
Iere. 17.
Truly there is no dowght but that this precepte was a shadow / and co^maundyd
to the Iuys for the time of ceremonys / that it might represente the spiritall
worshype of God / under the external obseruacion to them / Wherefore in the
coming of Christ / which is the end and the light of shadows / and the
truth of figurs this commandment was distryde / as other shadows of Moysis
law / like as Paull do testify evidently. Gala. 4. Colos. 3.
But nevertheless we (the ceremonys distryde / and the external coustome / by
which in the berke of the law / that is / in the letter the Iuys faith was
excersisyd) do hold the truth of this precepte / which te lord will to be
perpetual / and common to the Iuys and us / which truth is this. to f^re and
love God a boue all thing / and to pute owre confidence and quiettnes only in
him / which then shall be down wha^ we shall refrayn with out color from owre
concupiscencys and ill deseyris / which do nothing else / but break the mende
from God / ver and turmoyll owr spryth. The kepinge of the holy day.
Also when we self from the vnprofitabyll workis of owre flesh / that is
whicher spronge of owre concupiscence and wrechydnes of nature / ye to be
short when we refrayn from all workisco^trary to the spryte of Good / althowgh
they bear be fore them su^ similitude of man's prouidens / and wit / For these
manner of workis be all seruiall / from which the law bid us to sesse in the
sabotday / that God might dwell in us / work that good is and govern us by
the men's of his holy spryt by whose men's he geuyth the rem / piece / and
tranquilyte of conschiens. Iesa. 35.58. Heb. 3. q. 4.
Man's inuencions is bondage. Ihon. 14. Ephe 3. 1. Corin. 3. Roma. 1.
This truly is the true Sabott day / whose form and shadow was the same
iudaycall. The Sabott day is to have the spryt of god in owre hertes.
Therefore it was assinyd to the.vij. day which numbere has significacion of
perfection in scripture / whereby we ere towght God to commend and give a
pertuell Sabat day to us / which shall end by no term or time / also that
lyuinge we shall not sanctifyth plentuusly and after a just manner / on till
the seventh day / which is the last and eternal day / for althowgh we have
begone to enter in to his sabott day by faith / hit we shall not cu^ to the
plentuusnes there of / till the resurrection of owre mortal bodies / and when we
shall se God face to face as he is. The trwe Sabot day is not in this lyffe.
Hebreo. 4. Roma. 8. 1. Ihon. 4.
Now therefore by faith we have begone owre quiettnes in God / in which also we
do daily make progress / that then at the last we may profytte when the same
of Isay is fulfyllid in which a day of rest from a day of rest is promissyde
to the cherch of God / that is / where now they se him by speculacion of faith /
the^ they shall se him in ded / where now we hold his shadow the^ we shall
possess his substance. Isa. 66. 1. Corin 15. Gene. 2.
The so^day is not made to be halowid wither clamacion^ but with the Lordi^
word. Gala. 4. Colos. 3.
That which partayn to the sunday / which we do observe now is not instytute
therefore that we should sanctify the same a boue other days / and thynkyt more
holy / for all holiness is the singulere prerogatyue of God only / which did
honor all days a like. But that the cherche might co^togethere in that day to
prayers and lawdis of God / to here the word of God / and to use the
Sacramentis in rygijt order (which as it er out of order) in which thyngis that
we might the beter apply al owre stody / we should sesse from manual workis /
and from al impedime^ttis / which pertayn to the reason of his lyffe / that wha^
the word of God is preached purly and syncerly (as it is but of few) then we
might resayue the same with a quiet mend and a faithful heart / w erby we
might mortify / the workis of the old Ada^ / sanctifynge not only that day /
but also every day in the wek e / And ye shall not that we which ere faithful
out not to discern by twyne day and day / but for the cause of commune polysy
as is showde before. Discerninge of days is forbyddynge
Therefore holy days er not ascribyd and ordainyd / that we should honor God by
sesynge of workis whereby men get their bodyly sustinans / justly and after
Godis commandment / but by cause the cherich should co^together in sum day to
learn in herynge Godis word how to feed the soul / Which thing not towght
men were better to keep their bysynes at home according to their vocacions /
that is rulers to stody for the commune profytte poor men to labor for their
lyuinge / then for to cum to the persons barn / and there commit ydolitre in
mayntenynge his ambision / If Gods word be not towght me^were better to work
the^ to cu^ to cherch.
pride / and bestly lyuinge. Nobyl statis were better to hunte the bull here /
heart or any othere thing like intendinge to suckure the power with the met /
the^ to here sere Ihon singyl soul stombel a payer of matte^s in late^ /
slynge holy water / curse holy bread / and to play a cast kyke yack an napes
in a foles cotte. But I would God all men were as ready to do / to follow and
here the word of God / which is very Christ Iesue / according to Godis
commandment and owre Princes / as they er to do / follow and here the word of
Antichrist which is the devil himselffe / co^maundyd by the Lord of the word
and sone of perdicion. And ye shall know this day ordinyd for a godly polysy /
is now vsyd to the grett dishonore of God / so that it were better to be vsyd
never a dell / ye not to be had in remembrance / whereby men might work / then
to use it as they do for the most part. The body of Christ is mad the body of
an he lot for lake of true techynge.
Now the word of God is not purly and syncerly towght / but in few placis /
nor can not be truly towght it is so snarlyd by popysche losels / and with
their popysche ceremonys / Now meny men and women for lake of good techynge
do prepare the; selves mor for to be seen then to learn / shoynge themselves in
the holy congregation more lykere veneriall persons thene true members of
Christ / and makytt more lykere a fayer and pray fore the deuell then a body
seeking the glory of their head Christ Iesue / and suppose that so disgyssyd
to halowe the sabot day / folowinge popysch prestod / and Isydis prystis which
inwerdly deturpede / sanctify that day more by owtwerd garmentis folis cottis
and cokis comes / then by true doctryn. 2. Cor. 11.
And thus if men would well mark the effect of owre sabot day and the mysuses
there of I trust the mokis of sophystryans should vanisch cleue a vay which has
scateryd the world full of iudaycall opinions / which say that the ceremony of
this commandment must be abrogate which ceremony they call in their tongue
the taracion of the.vij. day / but that thing which is moral / that is that
thing which pertaynd to their manners do remayn still to us / and that is the
obseruacion of on day / which day they only chonge in the contumely of Iuys.
Markethe godly sprite of owre stolle mean.
But you have herd what profyt cum by such a doctrine. For they cleuynge only
to their constitucion and decresse / as the Iuys to the bark of the law /
that is the letter has and do dishonore God more a.M. times thene the Iuys did
/ in brekynge the sabot day / that is in causynge meny to er from the true
faith of owre sauyur Christ Iesue / nethere respectynge the fruifulnes and
profit of the same towerdis owre naybours and othere creaturs laboryng for us
/ nor it the effect there of as I showd before / in resayuynge the true word
of God.

Here end the.iiij. commaundementis contaynyd in the first tabyll / and they
prescrybe after what manner we ought to be have owr selves towers God / which
well merkyd do utterly condemn us and dreue us to self help of Christ only
which is the end of the law / that is of owre iustificacion / ryghtwysnes and
salvation / to whom be all honor and glory as it have byne is / and shall be
now and ever.
AMEN.
The fyfthe The fyfthe commandment.
Honor thy fathere and mothere.
IN these co^maundementis precedynge is declared the obedience and honor / the
fare and love that we must bear towerdis God and his gloryus name / and to his
minysters which er ordinyd of him (as I showede you before in the.iij.
commandment) to the coseruacion of the same. which er not ordinyd to respect
and rule their proper howsolde only / and to se it instrute and towght
according to Gods law / but chefly they must inspecte the universal cherche
of God ouere which they be institute / hedis / duckis and bushops / ever
aduertystynge that thing to bedone which is to the glory of his name. This don
he add particulere co^maundementis which also we er bownde to keep. Prouer. 1.
Leui. 19.
Therefore in as much we er bownde to sere and love God we may not neglecie owre
parentis / or offend them in any thing / but we must fare and worshope them /
we must obey them under the will of owre Lord / we must stody to pacyfy and
cu^tente them / in all manner of thyngis that owre workis may do them good /
and to thez that do thus (...) benediction is addyd / that is / to leave long a
pon this earth / to have the benediction of worldly things a pone earth. The
which promysse declare how acceptabyll the obedience of owre parentis is to
God / also that it might move and stere owre slugysnes to be ready to this
obedience / ye and to look for malediccion if we do the contrary. And ye ^^al
not this commandment is a particulere ^^maundement for the carnal father and
sone / and by nomens can suffere an allegory or popysche moral. Not
withstandinge meny (according to their qualytes) do roll in their allegorys /
but to say the trothe / in allegacio^s popisticall / vpholdynge by their
sophystical sciencis by false colers of hypocrisy the hoar of Gabylon the
venemysse dragone / a genst whom they have sworn the contrary owre ^ost nobyll
Prince commaundinge. When they have declared the duty of the fathere and
carnal son and show how every father is not only bownd to bring vpe his
soon after an honest carnal manner / but also after a goodly manner / then
they add like true colerers of antichrist / how all men out to obey also by
this co^maundementis their spiritall fathers / conwtynge themselves as hedis
and no minysters as geuers of grace and not as resayuers / the popys angelis /
and not apostels sent by their hedde Godis true minyster / as their one wordis
do testify / They say all mean generally be bownde to obey them etc^. as the
carnal sone is his father / there is no mane cane deny but that owre Prince is
a mortal man / therefore as it a pere by their wordis he is bowde to obey
bushops / and sere Ihon singyll soul / by cause they be spiritall fathers /
you that have faith judge these wordis well / I confess all christenne men to be
spiritual / and chefly owre Prince in his vocacio^. Svicitalfa there er of the
Dope / true minysters er of owre king.
For all persons elect er most spiritall in vocacio^ / owre prince truly is
one elect / therefore he is most spiritall in vocacio^. By vococio^ we be al
spiritall membere / but not fathers Ihon. 10.
This is prouyd by the words of Christ saying. The sheep which the fathere
have goue me in my hands no man can take them a way from me / that is / the
elect persons no deuell or worldly thing cane let them from the true
resayuynge of my word / by which they shall be made the children of Good / in
testimony of his name and vertwe / And owre Prince (as it a pere by his frutis)
is not only know elect by this mauner of calling but also by his
minystracion Ihon. 1. No mane is a ^oue owr Prince by ^o^acion^.
and dignyte / as it a pere by these wordis wryttyn in the book of wysdam /
whare is said / Mysdam is better then strenketh corporal / and a prouydent man
is better then a strong mane. Therefore Oye kyngis here and understand / learn
o ye Iugis of the herth / give are you that rule multitudis / and ere sustaynyd
by the pepyll of nations / for power is given to you of Good goodness and vertwe
of the all mighty / which shall prove your actis and judge your thowgh it is etc^.
Owre Prince therefore elect we may well affirm him to be most spiritall in
vocacion / Then why do they exclude him / with othere of his elect persons and
subiectis from their spiritall nominacion. Why do members extolle them selves
a bone their head.
If there be no bushope or shulble but such as owre Prince do admytt why do
they members claim syngularite a boue their King which is their head under
Christ / which in all thyngis cane soffere no singularite but all that he do /
think or speak is for the wealth of the hole body / that is the holle
co^munallte / whose office is includyd in the third co^maundme^t as I show
before. And ye shall not that theyer not only howlde to name themselves
spiritall but also they augmente this their spirituallte with a fatherhede /
when Thrist will that we should knowelege non but only the spiritual fathere in
heaven / which can save and dampene us / and when Christ do call al those which
do fulfill this heavenly fathers will / his mothere / sone and brothere.
Therefore their nominacion be no men's can betrwe / except it be for peruers
doctrine / or by their on children which sytt by othere men's feyrs / wherefore
let it be wypyd out of the Lordis sede / for the Lord can soffere no sych
sede in his berne. They be no fathers ^ut of othere (...) children.
Therefore their nominacion be no men's can betrwe / except it be for peruers
doctrine / or by their on children which sytt by othere men's feyrs / wherefore
let it be wypyd out of the Lordis sede / for the Lord can soffere no sych
sede in his berne.

Also ye shall not that every Man is bownd to bring up his children in
lernyn of sum good doctrine whereby they may know God / and with sum manual
work or occupacion / whereby they may get their living with the swett of
their face. And by cause every master out to bring up their children
according to the fathers will / therefore in this commandment is the master
bownd to instrute his discipyl or seruante well / and according to Godis
co^maundeme^te / whose duty is showd in meny placis of scripture. Timo. 2. Colo.
4.1. Petri. 2.


The.vi. co^maundment.
Thou shall not slay.
THat is / in as much God owthe to be louyd and faryd of us / let us horte no
man by any manner of men's / nor it oppress any mane by violence / let us do
noman yngery or wrong / but let us be always / ready te show benyuolence to
all men / both feyndis and ennymes / let us stody to please both / if they
be in any necessyte.

This co^mandiment will also that mynysters of the word / must not follow false
doctrine in kyllinge meny a soul / by their he risy / and in sleynge the body
for telling truth.

The.vij. commandment.
Thou shall do no fornicacion.
THis commandment will that they which will fere and love God / must so order
themselves / that they live chaste and continent all the days of their lyffe.
Also by cause vyrginyte is a singulere gift of God / let every man mark what
is given to him. Iaco. 1.
For they which take not this word / that is / have not the gefte of chastyte
/ they have a remidy offeride of God for the impurite of their flesh / and
they that do not use that remidy resyste Good and resyste his ordinance. Nor
let no man say (as meny do now a days) to have power to do all thyngis helpyd
by the hand of God / For the help of God is not present but only to them
which walk in his ways / that is / in his vocacion / from which these
hypocritis do indeuer to draw themselves / agenst the will of God / In this
peuysnes and presumpcion let not them look for God to be a helper / but let
them rethere remembere / his saying / thou shalt not tempte they lord God.
This truly is to tempte God / to indeuer and ercersys agenst nature / which is
given to us of him / ye and so to dispysse his present geftes. Math. 3. Not
what it is to tempte Good.
This godly gefte of nature the popysche sort do not only dispyse / in
misusing themselves against all nature abominabyll to specke / but also the
losels er bowlde to call matrimony a polucion which God whas worthy to
institute / which he did pronownse honorabyll to all men / which owr sauyure
Christ did sanctify by his presence / garnissyng the same with his first
miracle / but with most sotell statutis / rulis / and decrese / they do extol
every, zelycall vow / and progression / I should say every celycall vow and
profeschion. As thowgh their scalde vow worcester not one / and virginyte a nothere
/ They call their stald vows / agelicall vertws / doing great ingery to the
angellis of God / to the which they compare lassiuyous parsons / adulteres and
sum thing moreworsse and stinkynge. Men (...) more the pes ordi^cis then
^^^des.
And truly we need not to rehersse more tokyns / where the thing selffe is
manifest / we shall se truly by what grett and horribyll payns the lord shall
revenge this arrogans and contempt of his gyftis. By this commandment also
every man is bownd to have and use his wyffe soberly / and gentilly / and the
wyffe lykewyce the man / further mor to that they shall admytt nothing contrary
to the honest and temperance of matrimony / and so doing / they shall know at
the last to mary in the Lord.

The.viij. commandment.
Thou shall do no theft.
Which must thus be understand / when truly we owte to fare and love Good /
let us desayue no man othere be craft or fraud / nor let us not take a way
by hande^ and vyolence that which pertayne to him / nor we may not compass any
man in bergo^s and cu^nauntis / selling a more hyere price or in baynge a more
vylde price of those which knows not the valor of thi^gis / or by any othere
act and craft by which we do lay owr hadis in other men's goodis. But if the
fare and love of God be in us / we will indeuer more with all owr power to
help both owr fryndis and foes / as much as ly in us both by counsel and
help in vpholdynge and maytynnynge their bodies and goodis / ye and rethere to
minysch owr on goodis then to take a way a nothere man's / not only that / but
if they were oppressed by the misfortune of thyngis / we were bownd to co^municat
and imparte owre goodis to the sustentacio^ of their necessytes / and to the
alleuyacion of their need by owre plentuusnes. Let all christene men respect
to this commandment in helping the power membris of Christis body to the
power threshers of the Lordis corn / to the power creaturs which lake their
natural lymbys / and no more to uphold by oblacions the grett ydolis of this
world / that is Antichrist with his prestode / and all their Math. 10. Iesa.
58.
grett godis / let them no more hepe Antychristis box / nor hit is sect for
all their gay mockis / but minister to Christ and his true floke as Christ do
command promisynge a reward to al those that grue a cope of water to the left
of his ministers / and disci pilis for his names sake. Roma. 1. 2. Cor. 8.
Ephe. 4.


The.ix. commandment.
Thou shall bear no false witness.
THat is / when thou owtis to fare and love God se that thou dust oppress no
man by false accusation / nor thou shall not minysse no man's fame / by ill
wordis / and raylynges / nor thou shall not give thy aers to such brawlers /
nor thou shalt not suspecte or iouge any man to the worste part / or in the
worste sense / but if there be any fare and love in us we owte allways to
think the best / and to speak honorably of every man / and to bear the weknes
of every man / as egall as is possibyl to the honor of good and fraternall
cherite in concerning things particulere which partayne to human affections
and workis.

And ye shall notte that all those which vpin. hold antichriste and his sects
whicher parti culere and belymasters / give false witness against the true
body of Christ / in maintinynge the body of an harlotte / that is / the sect
of the hoar of Babylone.

The.x. commandment.
Thou shalt not couyt they neighbors house / thou shall not deseyre his wife
/ nor servant / nor handmayd / nor ox / nor ass nor nothing that is his.
Whereby owr Lord do teache us which out to love and fere / that we may not couyt
a man's wife / famele / possessions or any thing else. By the which resoue he do
much more forbid that we do not inte^de / by any fraud sotylte or craft / ye
all thowgh it be under the pretense of houeste / by the which we shall cause
the wife to forsake here husbane / or take the servant from the handis of the
master / or take by vyole^ce any perte of his goodis. But if there be any love
and fare of God in us we out more to norisch the love of the man and wife /
co^sellinge every man to keep his one wife and the wife here man / and to
exhort seruauntis to do their duty to their masters / with reverence / and to
defend every man's right as much as lyth in us.

That truly we er for bydyne to couyt a no there ma^s goodis thuse may be
takyne / that every man out to use him self to his neighbor accordyne to the
vocacio^ of his-office and state / He truly couyt a another man's good which will
not execute and do those thyn gis which he is bownd to do according to the
gefte of his calling. Not who is couyttus.


By this reason also the pepyll out to have in mende their kyngis and princis
/ mayestis and othere rulers / and to suffere their do minacion by a quiette
mend / to obey their laws and co^maundementis and to slake in nothing which
is not contrary to God is commandment. The office of duckis and lord is.
Again they must sustayn the cure and charge of their pepyll / restore the
right / conserve publyke piece and tranquilyte / they must be in help to good /
refrayners to the ill doers and so minister all thing / as men being all ways
ready to give fore their office an answer to God the hy king and judge.

Bishops and ministers of cherches lively let them labor and ply faithfully
in the^ ministracion of the word / nor let them not defyle the doctrine of
health / but let them give the pure and sincere doctryn of God / and instruct
men not only by doctrine but also by exampel of life / and so to give
inspectio^ to theyer shype / as good shypers to their shype / Agene the pepyll
must know them for massengers and apostels of God / and to give them that
honor that the lord will thez to have / and give them those thyngis which er
necessary to the sustentacion of their life. The office of bishops.

Let parentis take their children as co^mittyd to thez of the Lord / to be
norysshyd / tought and rulyde / nor let not them vex they re mendis by
onkenunes and strayt governance and turn themselves from them / but with
lenyte and gentylnes / and as it pertayn to their persons / let them amplecte
and con forte them. Iouth age.
Iunyers shall reverently accept old age / as God will it to be honoryd. Old
men also shall moderate by their will and providence the imbesilyte of youth /
and in that chefly / where in they shine and have knowledge by use of thyngis /
not troblynge them by herd and clameurs reproues / but te^porynge their
seueryte with all gentylnes / and fauere. Servants shall give them selves as
co^cernylige their office besy and obaynge their masters / not serving to the
eye / but with the heart / as geuynge their seruys to Good. Servants


Masters.
Masters also may not be curious and intractabyl against their seruau^tis /
they shall not vex them with much asperyte / ne take the^ co^tumelyusly / but
rethere knowledge thez to be their brotheren / and seruauntis under the same
Lord which is in heaven / whom they owte to love and soffere in all
manswetnesse. To this manner let every mane repute what he owthe to his
neyboure in his order and place / and that he owe let him give.

We have the holle law explicatt in.x. commandments / by the which we er
sufficiently instruct of all those thyngis / which the lord do othere require
of us / or forbyde to be done / as well towerdis him self / as owre
nayghbours. Truly it is esy to persayue to what end all thyngis do intend /
truly to teache cherite.

But first we er instrute that we should fare / love and worshope God / and
have confidence only in him / that we should call and seek him / and should
expecte and look for all things of him and should put owr hope only in him /
should rest in him / which is the sum of the first tabyll / by which we er
instrute only to goodlynes and pyete.

Fordere more we have cheryte with owr neighbors for godis sake / so doing
with all men as we woldbe down to / which is the head of the.ij. tabyll. And
thuse it apere that the obseruacion of the co^maundementis is / to love only
God and owr neighbor / and he lyuyth most best and holiest which as much as
is possibyll do not live and stody to him self / to his proper lukere and
profyth / and a gene there is non that lyuyth more worse and wrethede the^ he
which stody only to his proper luckere / seek and think only is one profyth.

ANd ye shall not that the law do not forbid only owtwerd werkis but also the
in werde affections and thowgh of the heart. There be meny which do ordere their
eyes / fytt / ha^dis and all partis of the body / in sum obseruacion of the
law / but in the menseson they hold their hertis fare from all obedience /
they think themselves goodworkers / if they have dissimulyde craftyly before
men which before God they bore in their hertis / They here / thou shall not slay
/ do fornicacio^ / or stell / they do not draw their sword / ^^ey do not myxe
themselves with harlottis they do not lay their handis an other men's godis. All this is well / but they brethe strives with all their hertis / they burn in
veneriall desyrs / they spy the goodis of allmene with schoymische eyes / and
dewouere all by couyt tuousnes. Now they lackyd the chefyste pownte of the
law / Against these Paulle Roma. 8.
d^ strongely try / affirmynge the law to be spiritual / that is / which
requiryth the hole mind / the hole soul / and hollwyll obediente / and when
we say this to be the sum of the law we bring no ^we interpretacion / but
follow Christ the best interpreter of the law / which did add nothing to
the law but only cleryt obscuryd by the lys of pharis^ys / and corrupt by
their sower dow. Mat. 5.
Like ^^yce as the virtue of his word / the spryte of his mowthe does now
also reprove Antichrist and his sect which reyoysse only in their workis /
thinking themselves more holy the^ othere by cause they have such hard rules
and orders / ceremonys wous that no christen man can ber or soffere. To whom
was these wordis spokyn^e love your ennymys / do well to them which hate you /
pray for thez which persecute you / that ye may be the chydren of the heavenly
fathere / Who shall be now the children of the heavenly fathere? The Pope and his
angels / Monkis and Chanons / freyrs and herityke etc. Then er we well at aes
if the powle shorn marchantis should be only the sons of God / if they should
call God only their fathers? Therefore the word of God do prove them only the
sons of the deuell / which do cast a way so lightly the co^moune youke of the
children of Good. But here their drowsy dreme / Owre life were to herd for
Christen men / As thowgh they culd make a thing more herder then to love God
with all the heart / mend and strenght / And above this there is nothing / that
can be thowght spoke or done / which no man can perform and fulfill (as I said
before) in this life / Owre ymbecilite is not abyll to perform the lest yotte
of the law / It is the Lord in whom we do virtue / He geuet that he co^manunde
/ and command that he wyllyth / Christians to be under the law of grace / is
not of presumpsion to walk with out alawe / but to be ingryffyd in Christ by
whose grace we be deliueryd from the malediction of the law / and by whose
spyght The first co^maundeme^te is her dear the^ all religions papisticall.
Roma. 9. Exodus 33.
we fulfill the law only by Christ.
^e have the law wryttyn in owr hertis. ^herfor in all thyngis / let us
respect the end of the law that is Jesus Christ, which made us of nawght /
and lost / restoryd us agene to the heavenly fathere by pryse of his precious
blude / to the which fathere / sone / and holy co^fortere be prayce honor and
glory / as it has been is and shall be for ever and ever.

AMEN.
Every planttacion which my heavenly fathere has not planttyd / shall be plucte
up by the rotte.
