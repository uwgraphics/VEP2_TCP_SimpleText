A Friends advice: In an excellent Ditty, concerning the variable changes in
this World.
To a pleasant new Tune.


What if a day, or a month, or a year,
Crown thy delights with a thousand wished contentings,
Cannot the chance of a night or an hour,
Cross thy delights, with as many sad tormentings?
Fortunes in their fairest birth,
Are but blossoms dying,
Wanton pleasures, doting mirth,
Are but shadows flying:
All our joys are but toys,
Idle thouhgts deceiving;
None has power of an hour,
In our lives bereauing.
What if a smile, or a beck or a look,
Feed thy fond thoughts, with many a sweet conceiving:
May not that smile, or that beck, or that look,
Tell thee as well they are but vain deciuing?
Why should beauty be so proud,
In things of no surmounting?
All her wealth is but a shroud,
Of a rich accounting:
Then in this repose no bliss,
Which is so vain and idle:
Beauties flowers have their hours,
Time does hold the bridle.
What if the world with allures of her wealth,
Raise thy degree to a place of high advancing?
May not the World by a check of that wealth,
Put thee again to as low despised chancing?
Whilst the Suune of wealth does shine,


Thou shall have friends plenty:
But come want, then they repine,
Not one abides of twenty:
Wealth and Friends holds and ends,
As your fortunes rise and fall,
Up and down, rise and frown,
Certain is no state at all*
What if a grief, or a strait, or a fit,
Pinch thee with pain, or the feeling panges of sickness:
Does not that gripe, or that strain, or that fit,
Show thee the form of thy own true perfect likeness?
Health is but a glimpse of joy,
Subject to all changes:
Mirth is but a silly toy,
Which mishap estranges.
Tell me then, silly Man,
Why art thou so weak of wit,
As to be in ieopardy,
When thou may in quiet sit?
Then if all this have declared thine amiss,
Take it from me as a gentle friendly warning;
If thou refuse, and good counsel abuse,
Thou may hereafter dearly buy thy learning:
All is hazard that we have,
There is nothing byding,
Days of pleasure are like streams,
Through fair Meadows gliding,
Wealth or woe, tune does go,
There is no returning,
Secret Fates guide our states,
Both in mirth and mourning.
The Second Part.
To the same Tune.


MAn's but a blast, or a smoke, or a clowd,
That in a thought, or a moment is dispersed:
Life's but a span, or a tale, or a word,
That in a trice, or sudden is rehearsed:
Hopes are changed, and thoughts are crossed,
Will nor skill prevails,
Though we laugh and live at ease,
Change of thoughts assayleth,
Though a while Fortune smile,
And her comforts crowns,
Yet at length fails her strength,
And in fine she frowneth.
Thus are the joys of a year in an hour,
And of a month, in a moment quite expired,
And in the night with the word of a noise,
Crossed by the day, of an ease our hearts desired:
Fairest blossoms soonest fade,
Withered, foul, and rotten,
And through grief, our greatest joys
Quickly are forgotten:
Seek not then (mortal men)
Earthly fleeting pleasure,
But with pain strive to gain
Heavenly lasting treasure.
Earth to the world, as a Man to the earth,
Has but a point, and a point is soon defaced:
Flesh to the Soul, as a Flower to the Sun,
That in a storm or a tempest is disgraced:
Fortune may the Body please,
Which is only carnal,


But it will the Soul disease,
That is still immortal,
Earthly joys are but toys,
To the Senses election,
Worldly grace does deface
Man's divine perfection.
Fleshly delights to the earth that is flesh,
May be the cause of a thousand sweet contentings,
But the defaults of a fleshly desire
Brings to the Soul many thousand sad tormentings:
Be not proud presumtious Man,
Since thou art a point so base,
Of the least and lowest Clement,
Which has least and lowest place:
Mark thy fate, and thy state,
Which is only earth and dust,
And as grass, which alas
Shortly surely perish must.
Let not the hopes of an earthly desire,
Bar thee the joys of an endless contentation,
Nor let not thy ^^e on the world be so fixed,
To hinder thy heart from unfeigned recantation:
Be not backward in that course,
That may bring thy Soul delight,
Though another way may seem
Far more pleasant to thy sight;
Do not go, if he says no
That knows the secrets of thy mind,
Follow this, thou shall not miss
An endless happiness to find.
FINIS.
