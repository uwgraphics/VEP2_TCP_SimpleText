Sorrovvfull Verses made on (...) death of our most Sovereign Lady Queen
ELIZABETH, my Gracious Mistress.
ENGLAND may mourn, as many Kingdoms way
A loss of late, that Gold nor Pearl redeemes,
A gale of wind, that made Kings hoyse up Sails,
When blustering blasts, brought Barks in great extreme(...)
Her Realm she rul'de, and bridled as GOD would,
With Reasons rain, that holds back Bayards bit,
To purchase peace, paid massy sums of Gold,
Did what (...) might, to win a world with wit,
Wised (...)ules Stars, clymes up to Heavens gate,
Makes Peace and Wars, and stays a tottering State,
Her insight saw, all outward flawes of wind,
Her judgment crept, into our cunning Age,
No practice could, surpass her Princely mind,
Her calmie words, could swelling Sea assuage,
Religion burnd, like Lamp in her bare breast,
And for her faith, she still set up her rest,
She gave great things to thousands, world well knows,
As at well head, and Fountain Water flows.
Caesar's, sharp Spirit, her speeches vttr'ed often,
Cyrus great power, and wealth she wanted not,
She pluc't down Pride, to set meek hearts aloft,
Her matchles deeds, great Fame and Glory got,
Opened her bags, to such as suffered wrong,
Much money lent, but felt the loss to long.
Escaped bad men, that sought to shed her blood,
Forgave great faults, to win worlds love and zeal:
But when most safe, in health we thought she stood,
Her Ghost past hence, (from Crown and Commonweal)
To GODS high Throne, like Torch and Candle blaze,
(Lost earthly light) and left us in a maze.
FINIS.
T. Churchyard Esqu(...)
This Phoenix dead, from her warm Cynders straight,
Inform of Man, another Phoenix rose,
Who clapped his wings, And flew up such a height,
(So near the Sun) that he GODS glory shows.
