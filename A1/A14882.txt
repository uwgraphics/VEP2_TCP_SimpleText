A COMPENDIOUS CHYRVRGERIE: Gathered, and translated (especially) out of
Wecker, at the request of certain, but increased and enlightened with certain
Annotations, Resolutions and Supplies, not impertinent to this treatise, nor
unprofitable to the Reader: Published for the benefit of all his countrymen,
by IHON BANESTER Master in Chyrurgerie.

LONDON. Imprinted by John Windet, for John Harrison the elder. 1585.

To the Right worshipful and his very good friend M. Robart Beale Esquier,
one of the Clerks of her Majesty's most honorable privy Counsel, John
Banister wishes daily increase of all virtuous knowledge and happy health
both here and everlasting.
AS the case stands in co^m^ncing of suits: so is it in publishing books.
The client tries his greatest friends which will give him countenance, and
feeth the best lawier to plead his cause: even so a^l autors present themselves
to such, which for friendship will favor their endeavor, and with knowledge
can judge of their profession. Then the reason is plain, the cause just, the
purpose necessary which has moved me to offer this my simple trauail unto
you, since I have often tried your singular love, and unfeigned friendship. I
hope you will accept this sign of my continual remembrance, and seal of my
thankful heart, not regarding the gift, but respecting my good will. Some
peradventure will think I seek praise of other men's pains, as arrogant
Batillus did boast of Virgils verses. For others have framed, and finished this
building, and I have only laid it over with new colors. But when it shall
be well weighed that it is a hard thing to translate authors, and more hard to
compare many together, but most hard to pick and to cul out the most
profitable things in them, I trust they will not detract from my labor. This
I profess, that my care in beginning, continuing, and ending t^is work has
been for the benefit of my country, not esteeming my pains, but hazarding my
credit. My desire is to furnish and profit a surgeon with the knowledge of the
body in mine anatomy and with manifold and plain practice in this book.
Whether I have attained the mark at which I aimed, or shot wide: I submit my
self to the censure of the learned, and chiefly to your judgment. For as you
are well known to be skillful in the variety of tongues, and endewed with all
other good learning: so have you sou^ded the depth of this art. The
consideration whereof has much more pricked me forward to present this book
unto you. For as it was due unto you in regard of friendship: so it was most
meet for you in respect of your knowledge. Lucilius would not have his
writings read neither of the most ignorant no of ^h^ best learned, because
the one sort v^derstoode nothing, ^he other more than himself. But I am
co^t^nt not only to have my ^ooke read, but also understood and censured by
the skillful, being willing to hear where I have erred, and ready to amend
that which i^ ami^^e. I know that some mall-contentes will vncourteouslie
entertain me not remembering that thorough my sides they wound others.
Against these I request your assistaun^e, that your name abroad, and your
countenance in present place, may be a refuge to this poor infant when it
shall wander from under the fathers wings and want the protection of other
friends. The father of light, from whom all good gifts and graces proceed
guide you in his fear, increase you in knowledge, inflame your zeal, keep
yo^ in constancy (and all other Patrons of good learning) to his glory, the
good of the common wealth, the encouraging of the godly, the discouraging of
^he wicked, and your own everlasting comfort. Fare you well the xxvij. of
October from mine house in Silver street.

Your worships loving friend. I. B.

The Translator to the Reader.
OF two things (as it seems to me) the reader will require a reckoning at
my hands: in both which like^ise, I am ready to render mine accountes. Of the
one, as by the way of talk and treaty: of the other (as more important)
necessarily. The first is, why I lab^ured in this translation: the other, why I
have in this sort brought it f^orth. To the first I protest, it was undertaken
by the earnest re^uest, and importunity of such friends, as I, in no wise was
able therein to resist: my self being, though not unwilling to do good, yet
unwilling at this time, to have undergone such a burden. Of this sort
perfourming it, my reasons thus I render. And first for setting that down, in
a continued tenor of style (but sorted into Chapters) which stands in
divisions and tables in the Author, whence I have it: The occasion was in the
mouers of this transla^ion, who made that choice for the benefit of the
greater number: for that (as they said truly) few Chirurgians otherwise could
understand, that they should read therein. Thus when I had travailed a space
in the traslation, and found that part of Wecker committed unto me,
defective in many points, pertaining hither^o, I thought good (that this work
might be the fuller) partly from other his books, partly from the ^ost
approved Authors, old and new, (in this point, taking to my self some larger
liberty) to supplye that wanted. In which doing I have neither so curiously
taken upon me, to prosecute every point, as that no particular should be
wanting, that might come in question in this art: neither yet (I trust) so
loosely labored, as that many things of value, shall be found to have
ouerslipped me. From whence, an equal mind may see, I have aimed both at
comelines and profit. And verily I judge him of too mean capacity, for this
calling, that cannot, by the light of these things, proceed into further
particulers, when need requires. For the cataractes and manual
administrations about the eyes, I refer the Reader to a treatise of old
Penemicus, inserted and lately published in Phil^ip Barroughes book. The
french disease needs a particular treatise: which we shall see (I doubt not)
in all parts accomplished by master Clowes our countriman, who has hitherto
not vnfrutefully labou^ed in it. Thus much for the Supplies. In my resolutions,
I have given some address to the Reader in things, otherwise (perhaps) not so
perspicuous. My Annotati^ns are both to give light to the understanding of the
text, to furnish further with medicines where I thought it needful, and to
preserve soundnes of doctrine, where I saw it not enough regarded. And let no
man here say, I go beyond the la^chet: but rather with judgment, and an
upright eye, weigh, and consider the things I have reprehended together with
the reasons annexed thereunto. For I protest, there is nothing on the earth,
has carried me into this course save only, a just and honest care of the
readers commodity. As for that learned man Wecker, if I have any where either
^rested his meaning, irreverently taken him, or censured him without cause,
then is there wherefore, I should justly be blamed for him. But if in all these
things, I have carried my self in a reasonable course, let not that be imputed
to me for a fault, which is (if I could deserve any) my commendation. Neither
can any man greatly marvel, that so much unsoundness should be found in
Wecker, considering that (except in the preparation of medicines) he has too
much tied him self to antiquity. I found cause enough likewise, to have dealt
with his method, but leaving that to the censure of D. Brights art, (a work
of more learning and judgment, than many will confess) I content my self,
in this treatise, to have looked on^y to the matter: and therein to have
provided, to my power, that the painful patient reap not the bitter fruits
of an infected judgment.

Farewell.
To his loving friend M. Banister.
I Received no sooner the report that your book was ready for the printer,
but I perceived some privily repined. I hope you regard not their words, but
continue your grounded purpose. You know that envy lies always at virtues
gate, and treads on her heels when she goes abroad. For as the deaf
cannot discern the sweetness of music: so the ignorant cannot look into the
excellency of knowledge. Maruail not if they say, there are over many books.
For either they can not read, or at least understand none. They never tasted
Latin, and if some of them have tipped their tongues with French, and sipped
thereon as the dogs do on Nilus, then they blase abroad their skill with
H^ppias. I doubt not (if learning had leaned upon the favor and fostering of
these good Patrons) but all the arts had been long since starued, and buried:
and the poor widow had been the best surgeon. A fisher in The^c^^^u^ dreamed
he had taken a golden fish, and therefore he would now live at ease, and cease
from labor: so these fools feed themselves in their vain fantasies, but
when they shall once awake they will harken unto Plato, who disdained not so
long to be a scholar, as he desired to be wiser. I would not have you vouchsafe
to remember these men, which think with mad Ajax in Soph^cles, that fools
have the fairest lives. Surely they deserve pity because they are simple, but
stripes, because they are wilful. An other sort there is which has more
learning, but as little judgment and honesty For they will whippe Homer as
did Z^ilus, and sift great H^ppoc^a^^s as did Thessalus. They have sucked
Lamiahs breasts in Plutarch which when she sa^e spinning at home laid her eyes
by her in a basen, but put them into her head when she went abroad. They are
as kind as the cuckowe, which deuoureth the bird that brought her up, and
with the male spider (as Aristotle says) they eat the pray, but take no
pains. You have felt these gnawing at your book of ulcers, and devising to
cut your anatomy as small as mootes. Of this sort I say little, because all
others say much. For as they have stricken all writers on the head, so they
have by them again been wounded to the heart. This fruit I am sure springs
from their continual carping. They weaken the painful hand, they make dull
the sharp wit, they poison the well affected, they sow contention amongst
the learned, they seduce the simple. They have the tongue of the horsleech, the
eye of the cockatrice^ the talents of the tiger. Not unlike are they to
Procustes the cursed host, whose guestes were ever too long or too short for
his beds: so to these men all writers seem too new or too old, too short or
too long, too plain or too obscure, too simple or too curious. They are always
aguish, for every thing is bitter to their taste. And deadly sick of a
desperate consumption, for the more they eat, the leaner they are. If you
tarry these men's leisure and liking, your papers, will perhaps be eaten with
rattes and mothes. Whereas you fear the censure and judgment of the learned
you do well, if thereby you be made wary in your work not weary of your
enterprise. For they having seasoned their censure with equity, and their
judgment with discretion, will pass over small faults with silence, and
reprove greater slips with modesty It is not unknown to them, that the wisest
man has his wants, and the soundest writer his errors. Then you are not to
fear the ignorant, which cannot judge of your labors, nor to regard the
envious, which will not like your endeavor, neither to shrink for the godly
and virtuous, which will accept your good will. Behold all hindera^ces are
plucked up by the roots: wherefore the^ do you doubt wherefore do you quail?
what do you require? what do you seek? If there be no people almost so
barbarous, no nation so rude, which has not all arts in their own proper
language. If Hippocrates, Galene, AE^i^^, Actuarius, M^schion, accounted the
fathers of this art, have written in their mother tongue, you have a large and
lawfu^l president to warrant this enterprise. And if mine affection (which I
owe and bear unto you) blind me not, I think no such book, in this kind, has
bin published in our tongue. For as ze^sis picturing Hel^n, drew the liniaments
from five of the fairest virgins of C^oton: so this book is borrowed from the
richest treasuries of the best Physicians and Surgions. Moreover whereas the
parts of surgery have been rent in sunder, and scattered abrod, now they are
cunningly compiled, and shortly comprised in one little volume. But above all,
you shall honor this profession in the eyes of all such who heretofore have
accounted it base and vile^ For they shall plainly see that it requires not
only a lions heart, a Ladies hand, a hawks eye (as the common proverb is) but
more especially good reading, sound judgment, diligent observation, wise
experience. The gray hears of this art shall wyn reverence with the reader, the
necessity procure loue^ the variety of things bring delight, the plainness
cause attention the certainety get credit, the continuance deserve estimation.
The matter has carried me further then I purposed, and yet I should have
written more if this bearer had not so suddenly departed. But of other things
at an other time. Fare you well (good M. Banester) and when you can
conveniently, write again unto me. The last of July.

Your loving and assured friend. A. H.

The Book to the Reader.
I swellings wast, I wounds do ioyne^
I ulcers do make sound:
I do the broken bones restore,
What further can be found?
To the Printer.
Have to the press, fear not the sale,
good wine does need no sign:
The Surgeons crave this work to have,
the gain it will be thine.
The Translatour to the Reader.
Read well, keep fast, try warely,
in no case me disdain:
Commend of love, amend with leave,
this crave I for my pain.
To the Translatour.
If Weckers works do praise deserve,
thy pains no man can blame,
Which both with new and needful store,
enriched have the same.
A work well bredde, and better borne^
but ^raynd up passing well:
The phrase, the notes, supply also,
this same does plainly tell.
If some words ^o the dainty ears,
or simple sort seem strange,
Know this, that arts to terms are tied,
and may not lightly raunge.
If methods plat be not so plain,
and perfect as some think,
Thine author did this way chalk out,
from him thou may not shrink.
Thy tongue from tauntes by reasons rule,
so wisely has been stayde,
Th^^ Momus eye cannot epsy,
with fault thee to vpbraide.
Such is thy fru^^e that painful Be,
may honey suck with ease.
But spi^efull spider cannot find
her poison to increase.
Then armed with Achilles shield,
Minerua stands thee by:
Though Hectors force do thee assault,
there is no ieopardie.
In praise of the Book.
As little Be in broyling heat,
does search the feildes about:
So little Book from Authors best,
best medicines sucketh out.
As precious pearl in li^le room,
does many virtues shroud:
So in this little volume is,
much secret knowledge showed.
As little Sphere by due recourse,
does heavens high unfold:
So in this little book thou may,
the wound and cure behod.
A^ loadstone does the iron hard,
by secret force hold fast:
So little volume in despite,
will envy make aghast.
As glittering Sun with his bright hie^
does other Stars deface:
So where this book does once appea^
i^ others does displace.
As Persian tree both flower and fruit,
does bring forth without stay:
So fruitful is this book to all,
in time, and place always.
Then honey ^ast, buy pre^ious pearle^
view spheere that turns fast:
Fear loadston^ force, walk by Sun light,
(...) fruit that aye does last.

The first book of Tumors above Nature.
CHAP. I. Of the differences of Tumors.
THE differences of tumors are taken from the material cause, Simple tumors.
either of which, or in which they are begotten, they come of a defluxion of
humors, sometime one alone, sometime more, one humor, and that either hot or
cold, the hot is either blood or choler. If the blood be good, it brings a
Ph^^gmone: if it be evil, thick and black, a Carbuncle, or Furun^le. But if
^t be mort^fied^ then springs Gangrana, and Sp^acclus. Choler of the gentler
sort, purchases Erysipelas without vlceration: but of the sharper choler, if
it be also thick, there rises either Erysipelas with an ulcer, or Herpes
exedens. The more serous and thin, nourishes Herpes miliaris.

Again, for the cold humors observe, as first for phlegm, if it be thin^,
there springs of it Oedema, if it be vaporous, Tumor flatulentus: if it be
thick, S^ruma, Ather^ma, Steatoma, Meliceris: ^^ it be waterish, Hidrocele: of
Melancholi^ comes Scirrhus, Can^e^, etc. Sometime Tumors proceed of more humors
than one, and when they do so, it is commonly of two humors conspiring the
mischief: Compounde Tumors.
as blood and choller^ if they be equally mixed, they bring forth a middle
effect betwixt Phlegmon and Er^sipelas. But if their mixture be unequal, then
that which ouerwaieth the other bears away the name also: as blood proouing
principal, the Tumor is Ph^gmon Erys^pelatodes, if choler have the
prerogative, Erysipelas Phlegmo^oles. If the humors mixed be cold, as phlegm
and melancholy, in like sort their equal matching breeds one middle effect,
betwixt O^dema, and Schi^rus. Otherwise, if phlegm be chief Oedema
Schirrhode^, if Melancholy bear rule, Schirrus Oedema^odes is engendered.
Again, if phlegm be mixed with blod, and that equally, a middle effect comes
between Phl^gmo^, and Oedema: Else the mixture being unequal, if Phegme excel,
there is Oedema Phlegmonodes: if blood, Phlegmone Oedematodes. Melancholy mixed
with blod equaly^ the tumor is Phlegmone and Schirrus indifferently. But if
blood prevail, Phlegmone Schirrhodes: if Melancholy, S^hirrus Phlegmonodes.
The cold humors also mixing with choler bring forth the like order of names,
for the tumors: as if Phlegm have equal parts with choler, the affect is just
between Erysipelas and Oede^a. Whereas if Phlegm exceed the choler, it
brings to pass Oedema Erysipelatodes, or contrariwise, Erysipelas
Schirrhodes, when choler has the pre-eminence over Phlegm.

We have said in the beginning of this Chapter, that Tumors are discerned
both by the matter, whereof they are begotten, as also wherein they are
engendered: and hitherto we have prosecuted the matter only of their
generation. Now it remains to declare, how they differ in respect of the
place, wherein they are situate. And first, Hydrocep^a^us, Parotides, Polypus
etc. have their place in the head. In the belly are P^ominen^^a vmbelici,
Epiplocele, Ent^rocele, Cirsoce^e, ^u^onocele, Sarcocele, Hi^rocele,
Pneumatocele. To the gland^les pertain, B^onchocele, Phy^^^, Buh^^ven^reus.
And to the limbs, ^ar^ni^hi^, Verruca, Th^mion, Mermecia, Acr^ch^rdon, C^auus.

CHAP. II. Of sanguine Tumors, and first of the true and legitimate Phlegmon.
D^finition.
THE true Phlegmon or inflammation is a Tumor begoten of pure blood, and is
specially incident to the fleshie Parts.

Causes and sig^es.
The antecedent cause is abundance of blood, l^^e as when the party is of a
Sanguine complexion, and youthful yea^es, or it being at the spring time, or
the diet of the patient be of much good i^yce, and therefore fit to increase
much blood. And here is to be considered, both the part that ^endeth it, the
part that receives it, and the part that draws. The part that sends it,
does it either through needelesse plenty of blood, which it contains, or
strength, or straitness of the passages: which thing fullness descryeth. ^he
receiving part does it of weakness, or largenes^e, else opennesse of his
passages, or by inferior situation. The part that draws, does it, either
t^rough heat, or pain within it, which things may eas^ly be found out. The
c^us^ conioy^^^^ ^ blood stuffed in the affected place it self, which whilst
it is unchanged, and not yet come to s^ppuration, the^e is Tumor with rednes^e,
resisting heat, pain, etc. but being suppurate, and turned to Pus, the Tumors
is so^t, yelding, and growing to a point, the pain is p^^cking, with some
itching and pulsation. And all the while, before it com to an abscesse, the
Tumor is red, outstretched, rand esisting the finger, the heat and pain also
is vehement. But when it comes to the abscesse, the Tumor decreaseth, yeldeth
out to a sharp point, and is soft, and easily pressed: the pain is pulslike
beating, mixed with pricking and some itching. Finally the skin in the
superfice or point of the Tumor goes away, and there is made the issue.
Sometime it proceeds from outward causes, as by contusion, wound, ulcer,
ruption, co^uulsion, fracture, luxation: which things are discovered partly by
sight, partlye by relation of the patient. The end or termination of this
tumor, The termination.
is ij. fold, viz. resolution, and suppuration. It is possible to be
resolved, when the matter is thin and little in quantit^e, the skin thin
etc. and it is a plain token that it does resolve, if there grow a certain
lightness in the member, the pulsation wasting away. But if the humor be
thick, and much in quantity, if it lie deep, the skin be thick, and so
forth, then is the end of it to come to suppuration, and how it grows to
that, you have heard by the notes before declared. There be i^ij. times
observed in this tumor, beginning, augme^tatio^, state, and declination. In the
beginning the part begins to swel, Several signs of the 4 times.
humors flow thither, and the pain is yet but little. In the augmentation, the
Tumor is high heaped, the affected place filled and the accidents inc^eased.
In the state the tumor and ^ccid^ntes are at height. In the declination the
greatness of the tumor is diminished, the accidents weak, and the matter begins
to change into another substance. There happens to this tumor (either for lack
of cu^e, or by error in the cure, or such other con^^deration) evil
dispositio^s, worthy careful foresight: to wit, co^ruption: which is signified
by black or leadie color, stinking savor etc. regressio^ or lurking of the
matter, which you shall know by the so^den diminishing of the tumor, and a
spedie following of a fever, with other evil accidents. Also induration or
hardening: in which the swelling swageth, but the hardness still remains etc.

If this tumor Phlegmon, Prognos^.
be not resolved and euaporated, it must needs come to pass, that the matter
do either suppurate, or corrupt and putrify, or else grow into a schirrous
hardness. Note also that sometime the cure is inuerted, by reason of some cruel
accidents, which importunately urging, cause all the means to be bent against
them, and so for a time, interupt the other p^oceedings.

The ant^^^d^nt ^^use, (which is blood flowing to the part) must first be met
withal, Cur^.
le^t it come to the coniunctiue: and this must b^, by euacuation, either from
thence, whence it flows (the whol^ (...), or a part thereon, as is the
liu^^, which thing, blood letting in the inside of the right arm, will (...),
if the strength and age of the patient be agreeable) or else from the part
whether it does flow, as by blood letting, either reuulsiue, as in a vain
directly aunswering to the contrary: or else deriuing, that is, drawing to the
near parts: cupping glasses fixed to the part opposite, as likewise
ligatures, and frications. The quantity of blood must be rated proportionably^
after the measure of strength: and may be repeated twice or thri^e if need be.
And the very b^ginning, or increase, is the fittest time for this remedy.
Medicines that avoid the part affected of the matter flowing^ must be cooling
and beating back: viz, acatia, vinegar, balanstium, bolus armenus, caphura,
capreoli vitium, folia vitium, folia Cupres^^, malecorium, mirthus, omphacium,
plantago, quer^us, ^ubus, rosae, rhus, solanum, succus hiosciami, terra
sigi^lata, vinum aust^r^^, etc. or these compounds: as first, a fomentation of
oxi^ra^um, or Pos^a, or Rec. oui candidi, olei rosarum, aquae rosarum, ana.q.s.
mix them together, and therein wet your clothes to apply to the inflamed
part. Rec. suc. semper vi^i, li.j^ vini austeri li. ss. far. h^rdei,.^^^.
malecorij, sumach. ana.ss. boil them and make thereof a Catapla^me: or Rec.
santali, a^bi, rub^i, ana..iij. glaucij.ij. terrae chim^liae, b^^^ arm^ni,
ana..j. ss. beat and searse them, and with the juice of Housleeke, Letti^e^ or
Pu^slayne, make a catapla^me. To this end also you may v^e Ceratume Psillio,
Ceratum e Co^iand^o, Ce^atum rosaceum etc. These and all other rep^llent
medicines you must use in the beginning, and in applying they must be renewed
often. But take with you this observation general: that you apply not medicines
that cool and beat back. Note.
If the tumor be in the glandulous parts, or the matter be venomous, or
thick, and unapt to flit backwards. Also, if it be exceedingly impacted, or if
it be a critical tumor, or stirred of a primitive cause, or else nere situate to
a principal member. Thus much of the antecedent by it self: now let us
consider of the blood impact in the affected part: which is called the cause
conioynde. Ca^se conio^ned.
If the blood already flowed be thi^ne, and apt to be euacuate: out with it,
by scarification, or discutient medicines: of which sort are these simples:
Anethu^, bu^yrum, faenum Graecum, fermenium, ol. Camomelinu^, ol. ricininum,
ol. leucoij, malua agrestis etc. Likewise these compounds: passulae, the stones
plucked out, mixed cum pane, and modico melle, or hordei farina cum melle^ or
lana succida, wet in warm wine, wrung out and applied, else a sponge used in
the same man^er. So that these digerent and discutient medicines, are to be
ministered only in the declination, and to lie long to the place, without
removing. But if the matter be thick, If the matter be unfit for resolution.
and unfit for resolution: then must you bend your skill, to change it into
Pus, with medicines, that do metely warm and moysten: such as are these
simples, vz. aqua temperate calida, bu^^rum, farina triticea, panis triticeus
modice salitus. adeps suillus, adeps vitulinus, adeps taurinus, adeps
anserinus, etc. resina, ocsipus, pix, caricae, ficus, cr^cus, thus, etc. or
these compoundes: viz. farina triticea, or hordeacea boylde in aqua and oleo or
radix altheae mixed cu^ decoctione caricarum dulcium, and farina triticea, or
this: Rec. decoctionis altheae, and caricarum pinguium li. j. farinae
triticeae. li. ss. boil them together, and make a cataplasme, or thus: Rec.
cortic. rad. altheae, rad. lilii sen^cionis, maluae, ana. m.j. farinae
triticeae,.iij. axungiae, suillae recent. li. ss. boil the herbs in water,
and stamp them with the rest, and make a cataplasme. These remedies for the
moving of matter, must be applied toward the declination of the disease: and
renewed twice a day.

Thus much of the antecedent and conjoined causes, If the antecedent and
conjoined causes concur.
alone, and severally by themselves considered. But if it fall out, that both
of them be in force, and reign together, then the disease is to be considered
of, as a complicate matter, and that according to the equal or unequal
mixture of them. For when they are unequally matched, Unequally mixed.
as when the antecedent cause, ouerwayeth the other, then aunswerably your
medicines must be of mixed force: to wit, more repellent and less discutient.
For that that flows in vehemently, m^st be repelled also vehemently: and that
which has meanly flowed, and sticks now in the place, must meanly be
resolved, therefore are some discutient things here noted to be mixed with
repellents. Oleum Rosaceum has that faculty: or ^his pl^ister, Rec. fol.
maluae m.j. absinthij. rosarum^ ana,.ss. farinae hordei,.j. ol. Camom^^.j. ss.
boil them and stamp them to the form of a safte plaster. Or this Epithema:
Rec. sapae iij. aquae ros. aceti, ana..j. ss. croci..ij. let them heat a little
at a soft fire, afterward strain them and make your Epithemae. Apply it with
wet clothes, or wool. These medicines, consisting of repellents, somewhat mixed
with discutients, are to be used in the increase and augmentation of the
disease: and to be shifted seldomer, then pure repellents a^e. Otherwise, if
the antecedent and coniunctiue causes, fall out to be of equal force in
mingling: in such a case, with equal mixture of remedies, Equall^ mixed^
it is to be resisted: to wit, equally repelling and discussing, of which
faculty, you have these simples, A^thaea, Mal^a, Camomilla, sem. lini etc. and
these compounds, vnguentum Basilicum^ Emplastrum diachilon etc. or a medicine
made with bread and oil of roses, or of melilote and bread boiled in passo,
else made, ex dactylis in passo coctis, and mingled cu^ pane, and oleo Rosaleo:
or thus: Rec. parietariae, Maluae. ana. m.j. furfuris, farinae volatilis ana.
P.j. faenugreci, anethi, ana..ss. ol. Camomelini..j. ss. sees them in oil,
and make a plaster. Another, Rec. medullae panis, li. j. steep it in ho^e
water, after strain it therehence, and put to it mellis.iij. and make a
plaster. These medicines that are mingled to repress, and discuss equally,
must be ministered in the state of the Disease, and need very seldom
shifting. Hitherto we have handled the antecedent and conjoined causes. Now
we follow on, to the formal, For the formal cause.
which is three fold: to wit, hot intemperature: greatenesse: and breach of
unity: hot intemperature, Hot inte^perature.
(which is also ready to raise up fevers) must be brydled, partlye by diet,
partlye by medicines. Let the diet therefore be cooling, and moysting: as
clear and cool air: rest of the mind and body, moderate sleep, but not on
the day, the bellye apt to stool, naturally, or artificially: meats of
little nourishment, as Lettuce, Spinach, borage, prepared Barley, etc. Vinum
oligophoron. Waterish wine.

the abundance of the matter collected, and to the place affected. The place,
for opening, is fittest, which being most outpointed, is soft and easily
pressed in with the finger: which also is situate most commodiously for the
purging out of the matter, being always wary to shun the veins, nerves and
arries: and above others, the morninge tide is preferred for this business. If
it must be done with eating medicines (which neither is so safe as the iron)
then have you simples for that purpose, lighter or stronger, the easier sort
are these, Adeps ranarum viridium, Calx v^^^, Cantharides, Cau^^^m radices,
burnt and pound with old axungia, faex vini dried, faex ace^i, lac ficulneum,
muscerda, ostreorum testae crematae, powder made, e ca pi^ibus muscarum, and

by his causes particulerly provided for, and may seem for the whole mat^er,
sufficient: but because there are certain accidents thereunto incident, and
which sometime hinder the cure of the whole, it is not in vain, if before we
conclude hereof, we do consider, how also to remove them away when need
requires. The accidents are these, pain, regression of the matter, putrefying
o^ the part, and hardness. For asswaging pain.
Pain is therefore to be mitigated by aswaging medicine^, called Anodyna, such
as are these simple ones: ol. anethinum, ol. Chamomaelinum, ol. e semine lini.

stronger. The first sort are either made ex passo, oleo rosac. and pauca cera,
applied cum lana succida, or, ex rosaceo, ouorum luteis, mica panis albi, in
aqua calente macerata, postea expressa and rosaceo permista. Else, ex malua in

stupefactiue, and consisting, ex folijs hyosciami, sub cineribus coctis, and
recenti axungia mixtis. Thus much for the pain. Now if there be regression
of the matter to the inner parts, If the matter turn back.
or to some principal parts, it must be revoked, by cupping glasses, or
attractiue medicines, such as these: Aristolochia longa, adeps vrsinus,

dracon^ium, euphorbium, fermentum, faex vini vsta, Galb^num, lepidium,

sagapenum, struthion, synapi, thapsia, tithymallus, viscum, etc. Or compoundes

and after wash the place cum aqua salsa, and thencefoorth apply thereon a
plaster, ex fabarum, aut orobi farina, cocta in oximelli^e. The incision in
launcing must be after the similitude of an Olive or Mirt leaf: after which
manner of incision it will easilyer heal. Lastly, the hardness, Hardness of

that sometime remains, must be mollyfied with convenient means, of which
again, here be both simple and compounde medicines for choice.

The simple medicines are butyrum, caricae. bdellium, althea, crocus, cera,
adeps, medullae, ammoniacum, galbanum, Oesypus, lana succida, malua agrestis,
semen lini, faenumgraecum, radix Liliorum, oleum Amigdal. dulc. irinum,

decoctae cum pane, and adipe contritae, and so applied.

CHAP. III. Of the Carbuncle.
CArbunculus, or (according to the Greeks) IT differs not from Carbunculus,
as Vigo and others supposed: neither does ignis perficus and pruna, but An^hrax

brings afterward a crust.

Causes and signs.
The antecedent cause is These causes touch but the Carbu^cle not pestilent,

black, thick, hot and faeculent blood, flowing into the place, which is
coniectured by the state of the body, abounding with blood. The conjoined

signs of the Carbuncle Our account of the Carbuncle is (...) the same^ with

clensing places, called emunctories, or near the principal members, it is
deadly: for it is to be feared, lest the venomous matter have recourse to some
principal part. If it break out about the stomach, or jaws, it suddenly
choketh for the most part. That is less dangerous which appears first red,
and after yelowish, but that, which is of black, or bloe color, kills. If
the accidents which accompany this dissease do much decay, and vanish, some
hope of health is promised, contrariwise, if they more and more, get strength,
and wax vehementer, then is there no hope at al remaining.

Cure.
Your curation must be considered first, according to the antecedent cause,

(for, because of the thickness and malice of the humor, it cannot be turned
away) but near the part on the same side. Likewise cupping glasses may be
used, or such like means. But the quantity of blood taken, would be great:
yea, even to fainting, or swooning, if there were not too much weakness

be out of the emu^ctories, it is (as I may speak) to be paled about with ^h^m.
The matter impact, which is the cause conioynde, is to be taken away, partly
by Surgery, partly by medicines. By Chyrurgerie, as scarificatio^ of the

if need be: to wit if the fluxion be violent. The malign carbuncle whilst it
is growing. must have the furtheraunce of means, both inward and outward: as
the medicines strengtheninge the heart (which in this case would no time of the
cure be neglected) and boxing^ or other artificial applications set down to
that purpose. When the matter is gathered, applying (as is there said) the
defensiues, lay to the place the stronger discutie^tes, ex coepa, theri^^a.
etc. then also comes in use the caustike stone, or (which is chief) the
hot iron, or gold button: after the crust is resolved proceed to mundifying
and healing. As for the s^mptome of pain last mentioned, though I have added
some chosen medicines thereunto, yet advise I the Artist, to be but spare^ and
very considerate in the use of them, even as driven to them by extreme
necessity.

Thus much for thy better address (friendly Reader) to take away confusion in
this chapter which happened, thro^gh the lack of a necessary distinction.

CHAP. iiij. Of the Furuncle.
THE Furuncle is a small Tumor and out pointed, Def.
joined or accompanied with pain and inflammation, especially when it is
grown to matter. Ca^s^^ (...) ^ig^^s.
The antecedent cause is thick blood, thither flowing, and is to be judged
accordingly, by the notes of abundance of thick blood. the co^ioyned cause, is
the same thick blood now gathered in the place affected^ and this is known,
like as the disease it self, by heat, rednes, and pain vehement, and with
pulsatio^, about the time of ripening^ it breaks also of the own accord,
without instrument, the matter that issues is thick and like putrified
sinews. in other things it is like Phlegmon.

A Furuncle by nature is not perilous, Prog.
though no cure be applied thereto, yet pain makes medicines more welcome for
the ^ooner dispatche of the matter. Cure.
The antecedent cause is to be emptied both from whence it sloweth, whether it
be from some part, or from the whole body: and so it is convenient to open a
vein of the right cubit, if age, strength, time of the year, etc. hinder not:
as also from thence whither it floweth^ and so the drawing of the blood to the
part, would be cut of, either by reuulsion, to the part opposite, if nothing
let, or deriuation of the same to the near parts if it be more convenient. The
impulsion, or thronging in of the blood, into the part, is to be inhibited (if
neither the thicknes of the matter, nor nerenesse of the noble parts hinder
not) by repellent medicines^ all which are to be ordered according as is set
down in phlegmone, so the fitter time for repercussiues is, i^ the beginning,
while the matter violently flows in, but in the state and declination,
maturatiues, as now in the conioynd cause, when the matter is impact in the
place and must be there avoided, then (I say) must the crude quality thereof
be altered by maturatiues: as whea^ chewed and applied, Raysons mixte with

GAngraena This would more properly (in my opinion) be reckoned among the
symptoms and not handled in a particular chapt^ as a new tumor being described
as a symptom a slip common to many writers.
is a mortification coming by the exceeding inflaming of any part yet not fully
accomplished, but some sense still remaining in the part, and in the fleshie
part only is the place of it. Sphaceius, or Syderatio, or Es^hiomenon, is a
full depriving of sense, and utter mortification, so much, as the part
affected, being stricken, lau^ced^ or burnt, feele^h nothing: and this inuadeth
not the fleshy parts alone, bu^ ^he sinewie, and even the bones themselves. The
inwa^d causes hereof, Causes.
as first the antecede^t, is blood adusted or corrupted, flowing into the
place, etc. the conioynd cause is the same blood, now already impact and
gathered^ outward causes to be much coldness, either by outward ay^ or medicines
ministered: unmeasurable heat and venomnes: al which extinguish natural heat. So
again, ligatu^es, co^pressions, contusio^s, etc. all which deprive the part of

(yet not wholly) heat of the member black or swartish color, by a fading of
the flourishing color, which was proper to the inflammation: also there is
pain, burning and pulsation of the arteries, going back. but in Sphacelus,
there is a whole privation of sense, black color, the member is sauft,
putrified stinking, rotten, and being pressed with the finger, yee^deth to the
bottom, and returns not: to be short all the signs of Gangraena, but all
enhaunst to a higher degree. Gangraena is difficult to cure, Prog.
but Sph^celus most hard, and not otherwise then by cutting when the flesh and
finewes even to the bones are affected, it is not to be cured. unless Gangraena
be in the beginning and speedily cured, the affected part easily dies, and so
it crepeth on to the near parts till it have slain the body, but if it have
not full possession, but only be entering, it is not very difficult to cure
especially in a young body.

Cure.
Whilst the blood is flowing into the part, seek to temper the quality
thereof, first setting down a cooling order of diet: as bread crumbs steiped in
water, Diet.

the same, from the place whence it flow^th by blood letting (if age, strength,
time of the year etc. suffer) and medicines purging and clensing the blood, as
Diaca^hol^ cassia fistula, T^marindi, lupuli, ^umaria, etc. also from the place

blood impacte may neither by stopping cut of the course of vital faculty, nor
by his excessive heat suffocate the natural warmth, to which purpose serves
blood letting (if nothing hinder) scarificatio^ of the place, and after washing
with salt water: cutting the member or burning with a hot iron. Take of blood
as the patient may bea^e, let the scarifi^ations be in number and deapth
sufficient, your burning between the sound and unsound according to the
quantity of the affect, and your dividing of the member be to the quick, so
that no part of the putrified be left: do it also quickly that the rest of
the body may be safe: for that that is putrified, is after the manner of venom,
by touching only, able to infect and corupt that which is yet whole and sound.
Let your blood letting be in some most apparent vein, about the part
affected, Simple medicines.
or near to it, the time for blood letting, and scarif^^ng is, when
putrefaction begins: cutting and burning have place when the part is
putrified. In the mean time local medicines for the place a^e not to be
neglected: which must be such, as have p^opertie to d^y and resolve, for such
are able to hinder, and to take away putrefaction: and such are these simple
ones: as erui fa^ina, cum melle, acetum mulsum, far. orobi, vel lolij, vel

lupinorum decoctum, etc. stronger than these are arsenicum, sublimatum, calx,

gentler sort is, Farina ^^lij, cum raphano and sale, and sometime with aceto.

Note here, that you wisely make choice of your medicynes, Canons.
according to the nature and age of the Patient, knowing that the rusticall
body may endure fittest, the stronger sort; but the effeminate bodies the
weaker, infants and children lik^wise require the easier medicines. Because of
ce^taine chirurgicall operations required in this disease, (as before is said)
there must necessarilye ensue certain symptoms: as, after section of the
member, flux of the blood, after burning, crustes and pain. After the
crustes, or escars Ulcers, which must dulye also be provided for: for the
flux of blood therefore, it is convenient to s^are the part with a hot iron,
for so the flux is speedily staide, and the putrefaction hindered for going
further, the^ apply after the searing succum porri, or sal cu^ porro. for these
dry and restrain the putrefaction, as also well prohibit the flowing in of
humors. The crustes then or escars (when the putrefaction cease to go any
further) are to be removed either with butter or axungia suilla, or cum pane,
farina triticea, or farina hordeacea boylde, cum hydrelaeo. or cum pane and
apio ^rito, else cum iride, radice panacis, aristolochiae, acori and melle:
else cum cephalico ex melle. Or cum tetrapharmaco or macedonico, or such
other. Now when the crust is removed, whilst the ulcer is purulent, it must be
cleansed and mundifyed, as with this, Rec. mellis li.ss. vi^ellorum ouorum^
no.iij. far hordei, li.ss misce. after two or three days add to it
mirrhae,.x. you may for that purpose also make your mundificatiue to consist
ex far. orobi cum melle vel thu^e. Then when it is fair fill it with flesh,
and after cicatrize it, as is said in other places. If pain do greatly urge:
then take the leaves of Faba inuersa, which being applied to the affected part,
do meruailously remove the pain thereof.

e These are accidents of the manual operation, rather than of Gangraena:
therefore I have rather thus translated, then following Wecker, call them the
symptoms of Gangraene.

The Gangraene cumming also of other causes than inflammations, as of extreme
^olde, impressed poison, and utter extenuation, and wasting of the radycall
moisture, (as Fall^pius observing, has testified) must (therefore) require
their s^uerall courses of cure: and all diverse from the Gangraene before
entreated of. For that which comes of cold, requires not the incisions
before spoken of^ but some warm and comforting fomentations, playsters, etc.
The malignitye of Venom must more specially be deal^e against, according to
the order delivered in the chapter of venomous wounds. As for the later sort
of these, seeing it chances in bodies which for their extreme consumption,
are utterly incurable, there is no device of man can ought prevail.

To the Tumors of blood are also referred Parotis, Phyna, Bubo, and by some
Phygethlon or Panus: though this last (by Gal.) is indifferently referred to
Phlegmone, or Erysipelas.

CHAP. vj. Of choleric Tumors. Of Erysipelas, true, or legitimate.
ERysipelas or (according to the Latins) ignis sacer, Def.
called commonly in English, wild fire, is a branch of cholerike fluxion,
cheefely consisting betwixt or about the skins.

The antecedent cause is yellow choler abounding and flowing to some part which
you may easilier be resolved of, Causes and signs.
if you note the complexion of the party to be choleric, his age hye
flourishing, and colerick diet, etc. the co^^oind cause being choler, now pact
in the part, is known by reddish or yealow color, great heat, small tumor, the
color vanishing in touching, and after returning. Also a Fever, stirred up by
the heat, but pulsation (which is the proper sign of a Phlegmone) is in this
not so great: the pain is a biting or picking, not causing tension or
strowting. There is a motion of a tertian Fever, etc. the times as beginning
augme^tation state and declination, and the symptoms, or accidental affects:
as turning back of the Matter, hardness, corruption, pain, vlceration, etc.
are observed to be the like, in Erysipelas as in Phlegmone. Er^sipelas about
the head, is a busy thing to cure, it catches the face most commonly, and
begins most of all in that part of the nose that is called Lepus: and
thence by and by spreads all over the face, by reason both of the lightness
of the humor, and the thinness of the flesh, in that part. If Erysipelas fall
in the baring of a bone, it is evil, and in the womb of a woman with child
deadly. An exquisite Erysipelas is sieldome ended by suppuration: but is
delivered (for the most part) by insensible out breathings. that which
becomes suppurate, corrupt and putrified, is evil, so is it a ve^ye evil
thing also, when it returns from the outer parts to the inner again.

Cure.
To take away the antecedent cause from within^ whence it flows, first, order
your patientes diet so that it may be cooling and moystning, and so let the
air be such, Diet.
either by nature, or else artificiallye prepared: as his lodging low, and
celler like, in the earth: let there be where he is, often pou^inges of cold
water from one vessel to another, and the pauemente sprinkled continually with
the like: and strewe the place with roses, violets, vine leaves, willowe
branches, etc. keep his belly solluble, and his body in rest: avoiding
exercise, watchinge, anger, cryinge, etc. Let his meat be, Lettuce, purslaine,
sorrel, gourd, barley meat, ryce, ptisan cream, etc. His drink, Barley
water, or small beer, or ale, but forbid him wine, and hot, sharp, sweet
and fat meats etc. And in all these, let him observe a temperate measure also.
The diet thus ordered, come to your sensible euacuations of the matter: as
inward medicines, most specially here auailable. For blood letting is not in
use, in a legitimate Erysipelas: but when it is Erysipelas Phlegmonosu^ only:
and then the humoral vain, or else the fairest in sight, is to be opened:
specially, if the affect be in the face. To come to your euacuation, it is
meet, first, to prepare and concoct the matter thus: Inward medicines.

Of Flegmatike Tumors. Of the true or legitimate Oedema. CHAP. IX.
Def.
OEdema is a certain loose, vnpainfull tumor, proceeding of flegmatike humors,
flowing into any part. Causes and signs.
It is therefore apparent, that the antecedent and conjoined causes are phlegm,
the one yet flowing, the other flowed, and heaped now, together in the member:
both which also may have procurement from outward causes: as falls from
height: strokes, surfeting etc. which are easily understood by the patients
relation. The Tumor is loose and soft, easily yielding to the pressing of the
finger, and retains the pit after the finger is removed. The pain is little
or none, the heat small, the color whitish or pale.

Prog.
The termination of Oedema is most by resolution, seldom by suppuration: and
often, by changing into nodes and other abscesses. Winter is the chief time of
their reign. And old age is oftest troubled therewith.

Cure.
First for the antecedent cause, Diet.
set down your diet contrary in quality: to wit, heating, drying, and making
thin: As thin and dry air, moderate exercise, and specially of the
contrary parts: short sleep, and only on nights: if the belly keep not
soft naturally, order it by art thereunto: as by giving figs fasting. stuffed
with the pulpe of sem. carthami. Let his bread be well baked, his meat, Weather
mutton, mountain birds, or made with Otemeale, etc. his wine, white, clear,
sweet smelling, or pallet, forbidding all po^age, herbmeat, ^eige, or papmeat,
all It comprehends all pease, beans, chiches, rice, and such like.
pulse, fruits, fishes, milkemeates, cheese etc. The diet so appointed, come
to the purging of the flowing homor, that so the course thereof may happily be
intercepted. Not omitting also, first to prepare the humors to euacuation, to
which purpose, these simples serve very fitly: radic. cyperi, acori, galangae,
ireos, enulae, apij, petroselini, graminis, asperagi, rusci, faeniculi. Also
betonica, saluia, hyssopum, melissa, polium, pulegium, calamentum, origanum,
maiorana, abrotanum, mentha, absynthium, camaedryos, chamaepy^eos, herba

In the mean time, that the matter flowing may find no settling in the
affected part: the same must be fortified in the beginning with repellents,
somewhat mixed with discutients, but if the affect be in the augmentatio^, the
discutie^ts must be somewhat more forcible, for thus defe^ding and strengthening

ANNOTATIONS.
a This Tumor is of two sorts: one gathered and limited within a certain
place, called properly and simply, Oedema: the other diffuse, and unbounded:
more rightly termed Tumor Oedematosus. This is of Phlegmatike bloud^ joined
with evil disposition of the liver, and unconcocted iuyc^ distributed, and that
always: the other, though sometime with such infirmity of the natural parts,
yet other some time of natural Phlegm, and of outward causes only: which is
then also to be cured by outward medicines. But Tumor Oedematosus, Tumor Aquens.
called of some the watrye tumor, requires both inward and outward means,
though of like nature, to the helps, of a simple Oedema: yet by so much the
more forcible, as it is in degree a stronger enemy. and so for this cure, you
may proceed in the same way, of the last chapter, intending and strengthening
al your means as circumstances shall lead you: knowing that the difference of
these diseases, is not such as might require other scop^s of cure, or new
natured medicines, but rather discree^ provision, that those your remedies may
be of strength enough so match, and finally vanquish the power of a stronger
disease: and this not in the inner medicines only, but in the outer also, as
here for a supply, follows: Apply a new sponge dipped in oxy^hodino, wherein
salt is dissolved, A mixture ex oleo to ^aceo and aceto.
or foment the place cum lixiuio ex cineribus, sarmentorum, caulium, ficus,

CHAP. X. Of the flatuous tumor.
De^.
TVmor flatuosus springs of a gathering of windy spirits, either under the
skin, or else under the membrans which cover and clothe the bones or muscles.
Causes and signs.
The efficient cause is imbecility of natural heat, and then the party has
weak concoction, and is given to a quiet or idle life, etc. the material
cause antecedent, is phlegmatic humor, out of which, windines is easily
gendred, and therefore cold and moist te^perature, phlegmatic diet, surfeting^
idleness, slouthfulnes, old age, etc be signs thereof. the co^ioind cause i^ the
flatuous spirits now already retained, either under the skin, or some membrans,
through which they ca^ get no passage, for the thickness or close substance of
those parts. the signs of the co^ioind cause, and so of the disease, are, a
tumor or swelling in any part, with a certain brightness or shining, which
being pressed with the finger, shows a certain resistance, and sometime being
smitten upon, yields a sound, like a bladder, or taber, the party feels
very often, some wandering windines, run hither and thither through their body:
the pain is extensiue, or stretching etc. Flatuous spirits not discussed, Prog.
bring many disco^modities. vaporous pufts coursing hither and thither through
the body, with pain and anguishes, are greatly to be feared, for it is a token
that some venomous matter was the occasion of them. Because the antecede^t
cause which is the flegmatik humor, Cure.

diminish the same, Diet.

CHAP. xj. Of the Tumor called struma.
STruma is a tumor, in which underneath certain as it were, glandules made of
matter and blood, And enclosed with a membran.
do grow, and these have their place most of all in the neck: though they
sometime be found in other places also. Causes and signs.
The inward cause is flegmatik humor wherewith the^ likely, the body abounds,
by reason of such a diet, used before time: and surfeting idleness, or resty
life whereto the party is addicted, etc. outward causes befalls, strokes and
surfeting life, etc. which things by the patients relation are easily found out.

They which have a narrow and short forehead, Prog.
with temples flat, as it were compressed, and large jaws, those are subject
to wennes. these kind of tumors do not lightly come to maturation: but if
they do, and after be so healed, for the most part, yet they spring again,
near the cicatrize of the old. The Struma that is small, of a gentle
condition, and superflu^icious in the skin, is easily cured^ co^trari wise, if
it be great, of a malign nature, and deeply lodgde, it is hardlye healed.
again if it be of late growth, it may be resolved and discussed, but the
inueterated ones cannot^ children often, old men s^eldom are taken with this
tumor. Pain and heat in struma, shows that it either tends to suppuratio^,
or else degenerateth into a fistule, or Cancer.

Appoint your diet such, as may both dry, Diet.
somewhat heat, and make thin: as temperate air, exercise before meat, the
meats of good juice and easy concoction, pleasant wine, etc. avoiding moist,
marrish, low or cellarlike habitation, overmuch repletio^ and satiety: also
such things as breed vpbreyding, and loathing in the stomach, gross meats,
drinking of cold water, idleness, or restye life, etc. let the quantity
always be spare, yea so that if the party sometime abstain utterly from
meat, it shall be very available for him. then proceed on, to the more
sensible taking away of the antecedent cause, by medicine: as first, preparing
the humor by his syrup: Rec. oxymellitis compos. sir. de stechade, mellis
rofati, ana, Inward means.

one dose, and so after for more, as need requires. when the humor is prepared,
purge then with this potion: Rec. diaphaeniconis, diacatholiconis, elect. indi

perceive the matter to be altogether unfit for resolution, If the matter be
unfit for resolution.
then have you two ways to endeavor the emptying of it: to wit, suppuration
and incision. If you see, it be meet to ripen it, fashion it to your purpose,
with a plaster made ex farina hordei, pice, olibano, and vrina pueri. Or, if
that will not serve, this: Rec. rad. aliheae, liliorum, ana, li.ss. coquantur

open it with instrument or ruptorie: as, ex calce and sapone: or, Cantharides:
or, with arsenicke. The last means, and utmost in this case, is manual
operation: which is to be used, when the tumor will neither give place to
resolutiues, nor yet be ordered by maturatiues, as has been hitherto said.
The same manual operation is thus to be performed. Manual operation.
Let the patient be laid along upon his bed, his feet fastened sundrily to
the bed posts, and his head firmly holden of some that are assistant to you
in that work: then divide the skin, that lies over the Tumor, with a straight
line, or somewhat slopewise: because likewise, the vessels and nerves,
contained in the same do lie in straight manner answerably^ this always
provided, that you work not so roundly, as to rush thorough the thicknes of the
skin, at once, with one incision, but by leisure: for nothing is violently to
be performed in this business. and in the lesser sort of the^, which are also of
the gentler condition, a simple lined sectio^ will serve, but in the greater
sort, the incision must be made after the figure of a Mirt leaf: and the
veins and arteries gently, and by little and little, bared, must be put aside.
After this, dilate, and stretch wide open, with mullets, or little hooks, the
lips or borders of the divided skin, and either with your fingers, lancet
scale, or spatule, separate the membrans, until by little and little the lump
being delivered from all his holds, may be taken forth. But if it be enwrapped
with vessels, with great heed then is the business to be handled, lest by any
negligence committed, great flux of blood should follow. In such a case
therefore, it is best to draw open with your mullets but one of the sides, and
so with your lancet, by little and little sever the same from the parts tied
to it. And this once done on the one side, perfourm so much after on the other
side. There being special care taken, le^t either the arteries called
Carotidae, or yet the recurrent Nerves be violated or touched. Now, if it do
fall out, that in making in^sion, through hitting upon some vessel, there
follow such profusion of blood, as tends to the hinderance and trouble of
this your business, then shall you tie up the same vessel, or (unless it be
very great,) cut it quite asunder: either else, if it bleed not with any full
force, stop it with remedies for such a purpose: and so proceed on with your
work begone. Here, though I have not followed^ the words of Wecker, yet by
the light of sense, and evidence of Aegineta, I have aimed nearer the truth.
And when you have proceeded so far, in undermining it, that you have brought
the foundation of it to a narrow point, it behooves to cut it up expertly, and
cunningly: as also, to search diligently the place, whither there be other more
strumae thereto adjoining, which in like manner (if you find any) you must draw
out, as is aforesaid. As for the flux of blood, that is not very forcible,
but in mean sort, such (I say) you may easily stay, by medicines of drying
faculty: as stuphes, spunges, or battes of cotton dipped, and again wrong out
in cold water, or vinegar, or ^xycra^um: which is a mixture of them two, and so
applied. But if your proceeding hitherto be free, and with out any
interruption of bloody fluxions, then go on to fill the wound with powder of
thus, and (As you would say) lintie properties, including plageats, dozelles,
or any such forms, as the Ch^^urgion uses to dress up a hollow wound.
lintes, bynding upon (for the better staying on of the lintes) wool wet in
wine. Again, if the case so fall, that any notable or large Vein be grown
fast to the root or bottom of it, then shall it not be good to cut it up by
the root, but to make a strong t^all or bindinge upon the same vesel, and so
leaving it in his place, till by little and little, it may break loose from
his hold, and fall forth without danger. The tiall or band must be of such
a matter, as may not easily putrify: as thread of silk: for those things
that easily putrify, do soon let slip the hold that they have. Moreover, if
your work thus finished, there yet remain any part of the bladder, or membran
that enwrapped the matter of the aforesaid Tumor, or any other outward thing
else remain behind, it is to be consumed by filling the wound, the first
days, with Cotton, wet in salt water: and after applyinge unguent. Or pulu.

pleating of the skin, in those places, whilst the parts be moved. And so
the very purse or bladder, wherein the humor is lodged, must be wholly taken
out, lest the same affect eftsoon revive again. The blood that issues while
the bladder is rootinge up, is to be stayed, with applying a sponge dipped in
ox^crato: or the white of an egg, mixed with astringent pouders: and ever in

Of Melancholic Tumors. CHAP. XIII. Of the true, or legitimate Scirrhus.
Def.
THE ligitimate scirrus, is a tumor very hard, and void of pain:
nevertheless, not altogether insensible. It is engendered of the natural
melancholik humor. The inward cause is melancholic juice, Causes and si^nes.
gathered in the body, by reason that the Spleen has not well performed his
office in draining it. And this is the antecedent cause, acknowledged by the
signs of Melancholy.

The conioynde is, when the same Melancholik juice is impacted (now) in the
part affected. The outward cause is, evil regiment of life, that engenders
and heapeth up thick and melancholic blood, which by the patient his relation
is understood The tumor is hard, and stiffely resisting: the color, mean,
betwixt red and black as it were brown, or swartish color. The sense or
feeling of the place, dull.

Pro^.
Scirrhous tumors, in the beginning, appear small, but in process of time, by
little and little, they are increased, and become greater: these melancholic
tumors, if they be well handled, are cured by resolution: sometime they continue
indurate: and many times degenerate into a Cancer. For the cure of this tumor:

first, provide for the melancholic humor, abounding in the body, and being
the antecedent cause of the same, by diet: Diet.
as, providing for a temperate air, the sleep longer then accustomed,
moderate exercise, solluble belly, and tranquillity of mind. Let the bread be

flesh, foxes, snailes, and salted meats. Of potherbe^ shun coleworts, and of
pulse, most of al lintels: and al gross wines, and red. To conclude: let the
whole order of his diet be sober and moderate. The diet thus appointed: if you

Of Cancer not vlcerate. Cap. xiiij.
Def.
CAncer is a hard, unequal, round, and venomous tumor, hot, black of color,
sod^nly increasing, very ve^ing to the patie^t, and almost with perpetual pain
afflicting, called in Greek Carcinoma. The antecedent cause being melancholik
humore abounding in the bodi, is spied out by the partie^ melancholic
te^perature, and diet: Also by conjecture of the time of the ye^e, declining
age, etc. The conjoined cause is melancholicke juice, Causes and ^^gnes.
contained in the part affected, and appearing with a hard and resisting,
unequal, swa^tish or brown tumor, swelled and exal^ed veins, in the compass
round about^ like the Cancer that falls into the throat. The patient feels
about the place affected certain ierkes, (as it were) a soudiane pricking.
Sometime again, it is heavy and dull of sense.

Prog.
The thicker and blacker that the humoris, so much the worse is the affect. This
disease can grow in any part of the body, but especially about the face,
ears, lips, and women's breasts, that lack their natural course. It is of his
whole nature, a grievous and pernicious disease. It is hardly at any time
healed, through the thickness of his juice, which in deed, can neither be
repelled, nor discussed, nor yet be spent away by purgation of the whole body.
But rather very often, of a not vlcerate Cancer, it becomes vlcerate: either
whilst the humor, lurking in the vessels, in space of time does pu^rifie: or
else the affect it self being provoked, and set on mischief by medicines,
unadvisedly ministered. Only those Cancers, that be in the most outmost parts
of the body, receive curation: but those that have gotten deeper lodgings
admit no cure. The Cancer likewise that is inueterat, and now confirmed,
admits not curation: otherwise then by rooting up the same with incision or
burning. Cancers for the most part, light upon those men, which have been
acc^stomed to hem^hoi dall purging, and have now lost the benefit of the same.

First, to buckle with the antecedent cause, C^^^.
you must provide both for the prohibiting of the generation of melacholie,
throughout the whole body^ as for the manifest euacuation of the same, if it be
abundant. Appoint your rule of diet therefore moystening, Diet.
and also meetely cooling: his meat of good juice, as barley cream, mountain
birds, fish of stony ri^ers, reere eggs. His herbs, mallows, arage, betes,
spinach, gourde, borage, etc. wine thin and delayed, auoydinge salt and
sharp meats, and all that gender melancholic juice. Seeing also that the
whole diet be spare, and moderate. It is good to open a vain, specially if the
blood appear black and thick, and the age and strength agree thereto: or if
the menstruous course or hemrhoydes have been suppressed before fifty years
of age.

Def.
THis Tumor, called Hydrocephalus, happens in the head of an infant, newly
borne, being of water, enclosed between the skull and the skin.

Causes and signs.
The inward cause is watrish humor outsweating, by reason of the opennesse of
the pores. outward cause, unskillfulness of the midwife, not cunningly pressing
the head of the child. If it be between the outer skin and the skull, the
tumor is sauft, of a like color, ^ometime without pain, and sometime painful,
outswelled, and yielding easily to the pressing of the fingers, etc. if it be
between the skull and the me^bran of the brain, then is not the tumor sauft,
and easily pressed in with the finger. but the pain is sharper, they shead
tears often, their forhead bouncheth out further: they look winking with
their eyes, and move their heads diue^sly.

matter you would purge be cold, use these: pil. alephanginae, pil. de hiera,

aggregatiue, or defumaria. if it may be resolved, or else, if it must needs be
suppurated, proceed in either purpose with local medicines, as is also in the
general. observing, that when the tumor comes to matter, you procure vent so
soon as is possible: least it corrupt the bone. Now if the bone be foul, then
is the cure the same, as in the corruption of the bone, through the french
disease. In both which if the corruption be but small in compass, deal with
it by incision and mundification, ex melleros. terebinthina, puluere ireos,
myrrhae, thuris: according to that is handled hereafter in the fracture of the
skull: consuming the putrified flesh (if there be any) with merc. praecipit, or
other such, ordinarily practiced in the curing of ulcers. But if the corrupted
bone be very large in compass, some counsel to leave the cure to his
prognostication: notwithstanding, I always deem a doubtful cure worthy to be
prescribed to a desperate forsaking: so that a christian resolution be first
stood upon by the patient, and his friends: and then, ripe judgments with
an expert hand, applied to the business. By which manner of proceeding,
that we may (at the least) sometime do great cures, Calmetius even himself,
that doubts so much, gives great hope: in declaring that he took out the
whole coronall bone once, and cured yet the party safely. No less also are we
in this confirmed, by the practice of Arcaeus and ^^tallus, as appears by
manifold ^estimonyes, in their treatises of wounds in the head. Go forward
therefore, to take away whatsoever nature has separated as unprofitable, so
that you do it still, with such moderation as you may appear, to follow nature
always at the heels, but not to go before her one step. which you shall do
(if you find the bone largely putrified) by taking away, not all at once, but
piece after piece, as nature supplyeth flesh in the room thereof. If the bone
corrupted be in one entier piece, so that the removing thereof at once, should
be dangerous, for the sudden alteration of the brain by the air (which is
the doubt and the case that Calm. reme^bereth) the^ shall you work safest,
either to break away the same pecemeale, if it will easili break, or else to bore
it, in diverse places, and ever after, as by your medicines, flesh grows about
it, to bre^ke it of further: til so at the length, you have removed the whole.
Your medicines in the mean time, aplied to the hard me^bran, must be such, as
are set down in the wounds of the head: except only there be exceeding foulnes in
the same, with superfluous flesh, and thick matter abou^ding: in which case, you
are rather to reach into the cure of ulcers, for some mu^dificatiue: or else

pour sorth the water, and set the mortar to the fire, til the powder be dried,
and again put in like quantity of water and do as before. If you perceive
great quantity of matter gathered, or fallen between the skull and hard
membran, appoint the patient three or four times a day closing his mouth and
nostrils, to strain his breath hard: that so, by the enlarging of the brain
and membran, the matter under the skul may be excluded. In which case also (if
you see it good) you may bring in use the decoction of Guaiacum.

place among the proper causes of Ophthalmia, and the Auth^ur afterward says

can thus cause an inflammation: I deny not bu^ the blood with these may be

Phlegm or Melancholy. Of blood through the abundance of it (testified by
redness of the face, and of the membran Adnata) by largeness of the veins,
sense of heaviness, and unaptness of the body to accustomed actions. The

if the Phlegm be dry and withered, or the tumor large and dry, and without
pain, there is speedy recovery. Contrariwise, abundance of hot tears,
little matter, small tumor, and that in one eye. or again, hot tears, with
white moist matter and saufte Tumor, betoken slow recovery. If the matter
begin to be white and saufte, and mingled with tears, or have invaded both
the eyes at once, there is danger of Ulcers. If the Tumor be great, dry, and
paynefull, it commonly exulcerateth. and sometime in that case it happens,
that the eyelid grows to the eye.

The inflammation being of blood, let the patients order of diet be cooling and

cum syrupo rosarum, made of many infusions, cum diacatholicone, and such other
medicines. after come to such as do it perticulerly, as, fomentum ex aqua
tepida, used often in the day, or Balnaeum aquae dulcis. Noting that in all these
euacuations, there be due regard had of the quantity^^ as also of your
medicines: Ca^tion.

temperature, year time, etc. according to the vehemence of the affect,
condition of the part, etc. If the caus^ be Flegmatik cause.
Phlegm, let his air be hot, the place where he is, obscure: his sleep
moderate, and nightly, his mind and body at rest, his belly daily loosed, his
meat heating, of good nourishment, not vaporous, nor slow to concocte. his
drink in the beginning, decoctum cinamomi, aq. m^^sa. but at other times
thin wine w^^tered, etc. always observing that in quantitye, he be very
spare, specially in the beginning of the disease. The Diet thus appointed,
consider if the blood be yet flowing, wherewith the phlegm is mixed, if it
be, make reuulsion, with blood letting in the middle vein of the cubite,
frications and ligatures of the lower parts^ cuppinges, etc. but if it now
stay, and ^lowe no more, first immediately empty the blood, by the humorall
vein, and after purge the body: but preparing and concocting first, if the
humor be crude, as with this Syrup: Recipe sir. de Bae^onica, Hyssopo,

matter being now concocted, euacuate first universally with medicines purging
phlegm, taken by the mouth or bellye: then also particularly, and insensiblye,
by way of resolution, as cum decocto faenigreci, or deco^to meliloti, and
faenigreci, or a fomentation ex aqua ^epida, cum spongia applied. All which
things must be guyded for their quantitye: varying or diminishing for the
greatness of the affecte, condition of the part time of the year, etc. And if
this affecte come of melancholy, proceed also by the same means, as against
phlegm, save that in this, you must use medicines purging Melancholye.

Supply concerning the symptoms.
^ayne.
THere are Symptoms also in Ophthalmia not to be neglected, and especially
pain, for which (if it be vehement) make a medicine ex pomo inter prunas cocto,

may afterward take away with a fomentation, ex decoctione chamomillae,
meliloti, and faenugraeci. If Pus appear in the tunicle cornea, through long
continuance of Ophthalmia, Matter upon Cornea.
that shall you wipe away cum trochiscis de thure, vel de mirrha.

ANNOTATIONS.
a Hereof may come distention, and so pain, as a symptom in Ophthalmia, but
we can give it no place among the proper causes of Ophthalmia, and the Auth^ur
afterward says enough against it.

b Neither phlegm nor melancholi^ can thus cause an inflammation: I deny not
bu^ the blood with these may be qualifyed (as in such compl.) yet thereof it
follows not that they should be causes of the inflammation. Else why are all
the Tumors of phlegm and melancholy before, shut out of the Catalogue of
inflammations. And like wise the inflammations derived from other Fountaynes,
then Phlegm, Melancholye, or wind.

c Rather anger and furious hastiness.

d Regard the causes and Signs following, as the two notes before do give you
occasion.

e If there be no heat, what kind of inflammation is it?

f These Prognostikes I take to be drawn from Corn. Celsus, lib. 6. ca 6. and
then by this word, Phlegm, is meant the matter, the eye yields in
lippitudine: and so I have here translated it, in the Prognostikes following.

k Or like means as in the cause of blood, save for sharpness of the humor,
or pain, which you must take away by purging (as here) and local medicines,
as in the symptom of pain is set down hereafter.

that I be not driven needelesly in every place, ^o cut off superfluities and

CHAP. XIX. Supply. Epiphora, after some (perhaps) Opthalmia non vera, bleare
and watering eyes.
EPiphora, Fernel Def.
(in this sense) is a thronging in of thin humors, (like tears) into the
eyes, sometime inflaming the edges of the eye liddes, but not the membran
adna^a. The original thereof is commonly from the crown of the head, and mould:
Causes and signs.
where under the skin, humors lightly resort out of the skull: which thence
distilling down by pericranium into the adherent membran, do at length issue
out into the eye. Other times they come from the interior veins of the head.
The humor is sometime cold and plainly waterish, causing no pain, burning nor
redness. And sometime again hot biting or salt, with pain, fretting,
burning, and redness in the eye liddes: whereof follows itching and
scabbednesse. Pruritus Scabies.
The first being called xerophthalmia, the latter Psorophthalmia: this coming
of a hot and sharp humor, the other of a salt and br^ckish: and this itch is
called of many, sicca lippitudo. It is easily gotten by beholding other like
sore eyes.

Prog.
The cure of Epiphora being neglected, brings many times the Web in the
eye. If skabbed or mattering eyes grow from infancy (as in some) it is in
vain to attempt the cure. And if it come through the perishinge of the flesh,
Cure.
in the great corners of the eyes, it is hardly recouerable. If the humor flow
by the interior veins, there is scarce (nay I may leave out scar^^) any hope
of cure. That can be done, must be by abstinence, and often purging: by
concocting the humors, and forthwith outpurging them by the stronger sorts
of pills. If it flow by the exterior veins, being not of long
continuance, and in a person of government: execute the universal parts of
the cure, according as in Ophthalmia aforegoing. Calm.

direct the humor by cupping, rubbings of the head toward the hinder part,
and applying the seton in the neck: yea, some much commend the application of
a cauterizing iron to the crown of the head: so as it be done to the very
bone, that it may ^kale, and the issue there be kept open long time.

CHAP. XX. Pustules in the eyes are called Phlyctaen^.
PHlyctaenae, are certain pustules, growing out of the membran Cornea. De^.
they are caused of serous humors, which do sometime participate with blood:
the party being of sanguine complexion, youthful years, having red eyes etc.
In others they be hot biting humors, causing accordingly biting pain, Causes
and signs.
and it falls then on a choleric complexion, or by reason of the yearetime,
being hot, or hot diet used, and the patients eyes are yellowe. If they be
but superficial, they are easily, but if they have deep footing, they are
hardly cured.

Prog.
If the serous humor participate of blood, open the humerall or median vein,
and that not once only, but scarifying to the neck, and shoulder blades. If
the humor be hot and fell, appoint a cooling diet: with meate^ cooling, fo^t,
and of easy concoction. Barley water, or thin ale for his drink: appointing
the patient rest, and frication, with bindinges to his lower parts: Forbid
wine, much speech, neesing, anger, much light and moving. Prepare the humor
with sir. violarum, de papauere rosarum, and such like: then purge with manna,
cassia, diacathol^cum, decoctum tamarindorum, prunorum, sebesten, mercurialis
siclae, senae, etc. or with sir. ros. laxat. o^ Diasereos, etc.

The place it self must be applied with digerent, and withal, lightly

CHAP. XXI. AE^ylops and Anchilops.
AEgylops is a small swelling, Def.
or inflammation, in the greater corner of the eye, when after suppuration, it
is come to an abscesse, it is called Anchilops. Cause.
It comes of vicious juice, especially of hot and biting quality, flowing
to the eye, and that either from the whole body, or else but from the head.
Prog.
If it be in a thin body, and with putrefaction of the bone, it is hardly
cured. For the diminishinge of the humor, set first the patients order of diet,
to be with meat of good nourishment, and thin ale: with exercise of walking,
and using frications and bindings in his inferior members. Then to the end,
to divert and euacuate, open the humerall vein of the same side, and set boxes
in the neck, or in the iugular veins. Purge also cum pill. lucis, arabicis,
aureis, coc^ijs, or such other. And to come to the place inflamed, if the
inflammation be yet but growing, strive to stay it, partly by such blood

CHAP. XXII. Supply. Phlegmonous tumor in the Ear.
Place. Fernell.
THis tumor accustometh to gather in the inner part, between the hard membran
of the brain, and the panicle spread before the passage of hearing. Causes and
signs.
It is engendered of most thin and sharp blood, which rushing in thither,
from the interior veins of the membrans covering the brain, at length does
putrify. It bewrays it self by heat and grievous pain: both tho^ow
sharpness of the humor, whereby it pricketh, and thorough the plenty
gathered, whereby it stretches and sundreth the membrans, whereof comes a
panting and tearing kind of pain: even such, as is found in all inflammations,
kindled about the arteries and membrans. There arises also a fever,
accompanied with his symptones. But all this while, no tumor, or redness seen
without, unless, (perhaps) by a double growth of evil, the outside happen to
be drawn into consent. at length the putrified matter, by little and little,
changed with concoction, makes an abscesse, whererupon pus either eats or
breaks, or (at the lest) is conveyed out, through the poares of the membran
of hearing, and so issues out by the common passage: to the great ease, and
lightning of the part, both of the pain, and burden, wherewith it was
oppressed. Such as in this case have weak brains, Prog.
and abounding with excrements, have their ear the longer issuing: yea, the
suppuration sometime very long abiding: still casting forth either white pus,
or liquid sanies. The universal points, of diet, reuulsion, and euacuation
being ordered, Cure.
as i^ taught in Ophthalmia, come to your local medicines, Calm.
according to the time of the tumor. In the beginning, (regarding the nature of
the affected part, and sharpness of pain) your medicines may be repellent,
for all the neerenesse of the brain. Make a decoction therefore ex plantagine
solano, vi^laria, lactuca, and such other, in aceto and aqua, and by a funnell,
let the fume thereof be received into the ear: adding to such a decoction (if
you list to make it more cooling) papauer, hyosciamum, and mandragoram.
Afterward of the herbs of that decoction, make a cataplasme, by mixing
therewith ol. ros. ver cydoneorum, vel papaueris: or other cooling and
astringent oil, and apply the same to the ear. Else, boil ole^m rosaceum
myrtinum, ^ydoneorum, violarum, papau^ nympheae, or such other, cum aceto, ad
aceti consumptionem: and thereof instill into the ear, by a drop at a time,
warm: or Rec. ol. rosaru^ part.ij. ol. amygd. dulc. part. j. aceti part.iij.
coquito ad aceti consumptionem, and drop thereof in like sort, into the ear:
or, (if the heat be great) you may drop in of the iuyces, or waters of
cooling and astringent herbs, cum granis aliquot Caphurae: or, albumen oui cum
lacte muliebri agitatum: which will cool and ease: or, cleum rosaceu^, cum
succo mali punici, and tantillo croci, coquito, and put it likewise warm into
the ear. Observing always, in this case, that those things you put in to the
ear, be warm and in little quantity. Cano^.
In the increase of this tumor, you must mix discutients with things coolinge
and repellinge: and therefore add to the former oils, fumes, and catapl.
althea, malua, chamomilla, melilotum, hordeum, and lentes. The state
approaching, wherein you must more largely discuss, add to the decoction,
semen lini, faenugraeci, absynthium, calamentum, origanum, and such other, in
such due quantity, as may directly serve your purpose, in more or less
discussinge, and repellinge, or mixte with the iuyces, or waters of those
herbs, oils both repellinge and discussinge, and use them by way of fume,
fomentation, or dropping into the ears: or of the remnant of the decoction
make a cataplasme, by adding unto it, convenient quantity of oils and fattes.
Unguents may you also prepare ex muccagine psyllij, cydon, sem. lini, ^aenugr.
butyro, a dipibus gallinae, anseris, anatis, and oils convenient to repel and
discuss, according to the diversity both of your intention, and also of the
time of the tumor. Discutient oils are chamomelium, anethinu^, a ^igdal irinum
lil^^rum, nardinum, etc. The tumor tending to suppuration, though it must
receive some fur^heran^e from your medicine, yet spa^^^g^y: for as much as
large use of suppuratiues, G^no^^.
would bring peril of great put^ifaction, in that place. Like wise your
sup^uratiue must be drying: a^nswe^able to the nature of the part: as this:
R^c. rad. al. he,.ij. mal. (...). a^a, m.s^. ^^am^mil. me^loti, (...), P^ ^s.

If there be (in the mean time) vehement pain, Pain.
studiously por^ide to ease it, as with cooling oils, waters and iuyces mixed
cum lacte mul^eb^i. Also avails succus cucurbitae and mali granati, cum oleo
rosac. and lacte: or (if there be much heat) cum ol. nympheae, papaueris,
mandragorae. Else, oleo cum aceto, vel succo mali granati, ad aceti
consumptionem coqui^o: Adding unto it, muccaginem, semen Psillij, and
cydoneorum, vel nonnihil caphurae, vel gr. aliquo^ o^ij. and croci, cum lacte.

Auaylable here likewise are, o^eum de vitellis ouorum (which is good also in
the ulcer of the ear, beeinge mixte cum tertia part mellis) oleum
lumbricorum, oleum Chamomaelium, anethinum, and de semine lini: So are,
pinguedo leporis, cuniculi, vulpis. Further, adeps a^ medulla cruris vituli, si

CHAP. XXIII. Of Polypus.
Def.
POlypus is a tumor beyond nature, growing in the nostrels, of substance loose
and fungous, like the flesh of the fish called Polypus.

Causes and signs.
The cause thereof is a thick and viscous humor. The signs: a loose and fungie
swelling in the nostrels, greater in the change of the Moon, but lesser in the
declination. Sometime it appears between the nostrels, but not much:
Sometime it hangs quite out of the nostrels. Other some times also it lies
more backwardes: as in the hollow way between the nostrels and the mouth.

If it be a cancrous, Prog.
or inueterated Polypus, it is hardly or never cured.

Appoint a slender diet: Cure.
the meats such as be of good juice, Diet.
and do atteinuate or make thin. Euacuati^
The drink, water of Guaicum, etc. If nothing hinder, let blood in the
Cepha^lca vein, specially, if the head be replete with blood: else, set
cuppinge glasses behind the head. Purge the body universally, cum pillulis
coccij's, aureis, sine quibus, etc. and the head also perticularly, with
masticatori^s, of masticke, and scannwine, etc. Then see that your medicines
for the place be partly astringent, partly pearsing: partly attenuating, Local
medicines.
and partly discussing, as is this water: Rec. vuarum imma^urarum, li.iij. mali
grana^i, balaustiorum, sumach, a^a. ^i.ij. macerentur in aceto and
destil^entur, deinde add, aluminis, li.j. vi^rioli,.iij. destillentur, omnia,
iterum, and with that water, touch the inner parts of the nose. An unguent for
that purpose: Rec. argen^i spumae, cerussae, vini, aceti, olei mirthini, ana,
qs. To these being boiled, you may put and mingle, aliquid rosarum,
balaustiorum, and aluminis. Another: Rec. spumae arg..j. cerussae,.iij.
male^or^, ij. aluminis scissilis..ij. with these powdered and odoriferous wine.
Frame it to the thickenes of honey: after that put in some ol. myrthinum, and
stir them together, and reserve it to your use, in a leaden box. If you see
that these medicines be too mild, and that you stand in need of stronger: you
may thereafter get unto you stronger also: such as chalcitis, aes vstum,
san^araca, au ripigmentu^, etc. emp^rast. Macrionis, Te^rapharmacu^, cum
duodecima part aeruginis: Ceratu^ mirthynu^, c^ratu^ e cera rubra, cu^ oleo
mirthino, and dicima part aeruginis: Psoricum Mesuae, Trochisci Andronis,
Musae Polyidae, etc. Else these pouders of later invention: Rec. squa^^ae
aeris, j. atramenti sutorij,.vi. sandaracae, iij. veratri nigri,.ij.
misceantur. and blow up of this powder into the nostrels. Another: Rec.
Chalcanti, chalcitid^s, aeris, vsti, ^ysi, ana,.ss. misce cum vino ad mellis
crassitudinem: then burn it in a furnace, and powder it, and use it as before.
If it be rebellious to these kind of means, Incision.
the last refuge is, incision, or burning^ as if they be ^auft, they are fit
for incision. Let the party therefore be placed in some Sunshine or lightsom
place: then holding open the nostrel with your left hand, cut of the Polipus
round, with the right hand, with a spatule made sharp for that purpose, and
like the fashion of a mi^t leaf: directinge the edge of the instrument to that
part, where it joins to the nostrels: then in like manner turning the
instrument to the contrary part, cut the foot of the Polipus asunder, and so
take it out. If the P^lypus be of a malign nature, Cauterie.
it must come to the ^^re of the hot iron. And if it be but a small one, the

swells out with heat, redness and pain. Prog.
If it be not resolved, it grows to suppuration. By evil handling, the gum

If it will not so be spent, nor repressed, let the patient hold in his mouth
decoctum caricarum, and lay on the place, ficum pinguem, cum modico sale
tostum. If it suppurate, and yet break not of it self: by pricking it with a
lancet point, or quill, it runs out: and often times heals of it self:
howbeit, if you find it in a body of suspicious quality, I hold it saffer to
make incision wider, and to lay open the place more largely, lest it run into
t^^ danger of a fistula: Loc. cit.
as also AEtius justly suspecteth. After the opening, wash it with aqua mulsa,
or, mel rosarum. Being cleansed, dry it up cum puluere balaustiorum torre^
act. and modico aluminis vsti, or such other: applying thickets of lint upon
the place, both for the cause of drying, as also to press down and close
again the separated sides. Out of this evil springs, Epulis.
as is noted before, Loc. cit.
Epulis, which is an outgrowing of flesh in the gummes. For this, Orisabius
counsaileth a powder, Tetr. 4. ser 2. c. 50.
consisting ex pari portione vitrioli, and mirrhae, cum modico aluminis,

settled to the bottom, power away that liquor, and put in fresh, stirring it
long time. Let it then settle, after separate also the water, and put in new:
do so like wise the third time. Last of all, leave the vessel filled with
water, in the Sun (stirring it every day, and ^^llinge it up, still when the
water i^ consumed) for 40. days. After the last expense of the liquor, the
powder being dry, keep it in an earthen pot, in a dry place, so as it may not
be tainted with moisture. And this (s^yeth he) makes his escar without
biting, and depresseth loose swellings. Perticularly he praises it, in this
case, and for putrified gummes. If Epu^es be very painful, and inflamed, as
it is sometime seen, A^t tetr 2 ser. 4. ca. 25
so as the party cannot open his mouth: then first must you practice to delay
the inflammation, and that, as by vniue^sall means, (according as the case
requires) so also by local medicines: as washings of the mouth with aqua
mulsa, succus ptisanae: or, decoctum sem. lini. And emplastring the whole ^aw,
with a cataplasme, ex semine lini, and aqua mulsa. The inflammation being done
away, so as the mouth may open, apply the powder to your purpose, or in the
want thereof: Rec. aluminis scissilis..ij. gallarum,.iiij. salis terrefacti,.j.

down in Pa^ilis. And I suppose, that nothing can in this case be done by the
way of these medicines^ that a provident a^tist cannot as quickly accomplish,
by discrete use of the caustike stone. The ancient authors, beyond all these
means, come (at the last) to incisio^. Pareus prefers before all other that
it be bound with a double threede^ li. 7. c. 4.
and followed still with strayter bynding, till it fall of, burning the place
afterward, with a causticke applied in a hollow pipe: or, cum aqua forti: or,

sometime, a^ that it grew forth at the mouth, to the great deformity of the
face.

centauriae, and though it reuerse, Li. 7. c. 5.
to cure it yet again in the same order. Pareus chooses to prevent the reuerse,
by opening the tumor with a hot iron: (devised safely, by means of a plate
with a hole in it, for defense of the other parts of the mouth) and washing
afterward the place, ex decocto hordei, melle and zaccharo rosato.

AEtius tells in young bodies: to wit, drinking much wine, and greedy devouring
of meats, specially rough or sharp tasted: as I also have seen it, by excessive
eating of cheries. The Tumor is evident to see and feel. Besides, the patient
feels, as a lump sticking in his jaws, hindering his swallowe: but all this

suffocation, then that, which is relaxed only. When by occasion of this

Supply. CHAP. XXVIII. Angina.
Def.
ANgina is that affecte of the throat, wherein larynx by some inward occasion,
is straightened, Fernel. lib. 5. c. 9.
to the procuring of suffocation. Angina is of two sorts, in general: one
true, another falls: of the true are four differences: Differences with Causes
and signs.
the first accounted of Hippochrates, the most dangerous of al others, when
neither in the jaws within, nor in the throat without, any evil at al is
seen. This inflammation being altogether hidden, brings forth most cruel
accidents, with peril of present suffocation. Of this kind of angina, Fernelius
testifyeth he has seen die, in the space of xviij. houres^ being perfect in
mind and senses. The second kind is, when the inner muscles of larynx, and
the jaws are tainted with inflamatio^. this has as cruel accidents as the
former, but with less perill^ for as much as it shows it self by manifest
tumor, which may have riddance out by the mouth^ The third sort occupies the
iaws within, together with the throat outwardly, apparent by tumor and rednes,
accompanied with sense of heat, and pain. the symptoms of this, are no
slighter than of the former, save with more hope of health: in that the
inflammation bearing outward, is so much easier to be breathed out, and
discussed by medicines. The 4. is judged lightest and safest of all the rest,
this touches not the iaws within, but the outward throat only, and his
muscles: by the swelling of which, notwithstanding, it comes to pass, that
the inner muscles of larynx, are compressed, and so the passage of air
straightned. The cause of these sorts is, a sanguine or cholerike Fluxion,
which flowing into these parts, by the branches of the iugular veins,
pertaining unto them do bring forth either Erysipelas or Phlegmon. The evident
causes are sundry, to wit, cold rather then hot, either air, or drinking:
strokes fish bones, or pinnes, etc swallowed: drunkenness and all excess.
For signs, these kinds have (besides those that are common to every Angina)
tumor, Heat, and Fever, the last of which signs, is a continual companion
of every true angina. False Angina.
Now the false angina, that is without all Fever, and proceeds of a
distillation of pituitous matter, in the jaws and muscles of the throat. in
which, though there be tumor, yet without redness, heat and fever. The common
signs of al sorts of angina, are, straightness of breathing, difficulty in
swallowing, (so as the drink sometime leapeth up into the nose) and great pain
about the jaws.

Those sorts be most grievous and soonest kill, Prog. Hip. 3. prog. 18. Aph. l.

(yea commonly in one day) that making no appearaunce, neither within nor

Angina, have the matter converted to the lunges, they either die in seven
days, or after fall into Empiema. Cure. Ioub. loc. cit.
Set a diet most spare and slender: both for that the disease being most
sharp, requires it, as also for the vnfillinge of the vessels, which in this
case is very requisite. In the case of inflammation make the air colder, Diet.
Appoint sleep to the patient, in the beginning of this disease, that so
there may be a reuoking of the humors and spirits, to their proper mansions:
but about the state, and rypening of the humors more watchfulness is meeter,
least in sleep time, the matter that should be avoided upward, steal down
into the lunges, or ventricle. Let the patient procure such rest to the part
affected, in the first days, as that he neither speak, chew, nor gargle: so
long as the vehemencye of the Fluxion endures. but use frication to the whole
body, hot bathinge of the feet, and painful ligatures to the limbs, for
reuulsion sake. Afterward, the inflammation and fluxion for the most part being
stayed, both walking, speech and gargling, ar very convenient. The belly must
yield his course every day. All immoderate affections must cease: especially
anger, and exceeding joy, and whatsoever might give occasion to laughter. Blood
letting would be in the beginning of every true angina, Order of cure partic.
if there be strength to bear it, yea though there be no great fullness: and
that not once only, but again and again on the same day (if need require)
repeated. providing and using in the mean time, from the first blood letting,
your local medicines, both inward, and outward: this having the same scopes
of cure, concerning the particular times thereof, as other ordinarye tumors,
arising of a Fluxion: to wit, in the beginning to repel or beat back only. In
the augmentation, to resolve with all. in the state to repel and discuss
equally, and in the declination, simply to discuss or resolve. Repellents
convenient, are these simples: Acetum, succus mori, (as well fruit as tree)
succus corticis vi^idis iuglandium, malorum cydoneorum, granatorum acidorum
cumsuo corio contusorum, pirorum agrestium, and prunellorum: Also the juice of
the tree Cornus, omphacium, etc. Again for decoctions: radix bistoriae, rhus
coriariorum, summitates rubi, lentisci and myrti, myrta ipsa, plantago, oxalis,
vtrumque cichoriu^, portulaca, lens palustris, gallae in ^ maturae: sorba and
mespila immatura, viua^ea, calices gla^diu^, spo^gia bedegaris, citini,
balaustia, rosae, alume^, and such others. Of these may you provide, (as the
case requires) repelle^t collusions, or decoctio^s, to hold in the mouth:
observing that your repele^t medicines be not to strong at first, as for
example: oxycratu^ very fit to begin withal. or this, Rec, aquae peculi ros.

and ever when they are used, the cold must be taken of at least, for things
cold in act, as those that be too hot, do exasperate the Fluxion, and
increase pain. And in the beginning of the inflamatio^s of these parts^ use no
honey, not sweet syrupes, the first whereof, provoke the Fluxion by his
acrimonie, the latter sort, are abstersive, and opening by their sweetness:
howsoever otherwise consisting of simples astringent, and engrossing. Excepting
nevertheless the vrgency of pain, which may sometime enforce us to the use of
some of them, as, s^r. viol. papaueris, etc. A thing well observed of Calm in
his practice. The outward means, in the beginning of the true angina, ought
not to be merely relaxing, as the common practice imports. For if the throat
without, be fomented with oiles, or plastered with cataplasmes, what reason ca^
be showed, that their properties should not pears to the affected part within?
if they do, and they be relaxing, shall you not so much the more increase the
fluxion? shall you not so much frustrate the work of your inward medicines,
and so in effect, set up with one hand, and pull down with another? Lib. 4.
Trallianus has noted it long ago, a thing extremely dangerous: and amongst
the late writers some likewise have given warning of it: namely Rondele^ius and
Ioubertus: though none of the^ (in my opinion) have sufficiently enough
withstood it, in their practice: for whilste some of the^ mingle so small
astringencie, with such plenty of resolving, and mollifying medicines, as
appears in that receipt Ioubertus gathers out of Trallian: I fear least
that proverb may be truly said therein: (as good never awhit, as never the
better.) This is the receipt, that others may judge likewise. Rec. micarum

beginning of an inflammation: especially, if the bread therein, be understood
fo^^ pure wheat bread. R^deletius, if he had continued the same course in his
chapter de Angina, (touching this point) a^ in his chapter before, de
Tonsillaru^ inflamatione, he had both counseled, and practiced, I must have
held him free from all stain of this error. Howbeit, howsoever afterward he
for ga^e himself, let us lay hold of hi^ first sound counsel, which is, to
minister in the beginning of Angin^^ both inwardly and outwardly, medicines
drying, with a certain as^rictio^ which having concluded first, from the
authority of Dioscorides: and a reason, drawn from the constitution of the
parts, he afterward confirms from his own manifold experience: namely in
the use of Cipresse nuttes: wherehence he takes just occasion, to lay down
the receipt of a cataplasme, of effect aunswerable to his rule before
prescribed: to wit, Rec. nidi hirundinis, iij. pulu^ nucum cupressi.j. ros.ss.
excipiantur oxymellite. fia^que ad f^rmam cataplasmasis: apply this to the
sides of the throat. This knitteth together the parts: Otherwise naturally
loose, and dries up the humor flowed. Fit also for the beginning is this: R^c.
^ungorum sambu^i, q.s. in serolactis infundantur, donec mollescani, d^in
con^undantur, and apply it as is said of the former. In the mean time, let the
patient have the same Fungi, steeped in all his drink. And in the infusion of
them, done in aqua rosacea, or Plan^ag. Wet clothes and lay them upon the
head. To which use, Parac^lsus appoynteth aqua ros. rubearum, bursae pastoris,

repellents: if within few hours, the fluxion remit not, or (especially) if the
blood showed the body repleat with evil juice, com to the other general
euacuatio^ of the body: which because it can seldom be done by potion or pill,
you shall sufficiently perform by clister, as on this wise: Ioubert.

by authors of great authority, in the extreme peril of it, to be by incision
of the rough artery: as extreme points of diseases require extreme practices
of remedies, and the keeping of breath and life, for a short time, (though by a
hard kind of means) in this most sharp disease, may be if much avail for
nature, in the mean time, either by resolution or suppuration, to save her

as, Aretaeus, and some other: but their reasons being these: First, that the
weland being wounded cannot be healed again. Secondly: that the new wound,
causes a new inflammation: are easily answered. The latter being a case, that
by means may be prevented: and the former a thing that experience daily
improueth. When you come to it therefore, make your incisio^ betwixt two of the

be warmer then ordinary: because it must now, by so short a space, pass to
the lungs, without that alteration it was wont to have, when it was received
through the jaws, which may satisfy Aretaus also, for his objection of cough
and suffocatio^, which (perhaps) he feared, through the coldness of the air.

Causes and ^ignes.
THE prominencie of standing forth of the Nauel is called also in Greek
Exomphalon. The outward causes are falls, strokes, labor, crying, coughing,
etc. (as the party himself, or the bystanders can lightly report.) The inward
causes are ruptures or breaches, by which, either the kell, or guts fall
down into that place^ if it be the kell: the tumor is sauft in feeling,
unequal, of a like color, etc. If it be the guts, the tumor is also saufte,
unequal, easily giving place, and vanishing at the impression of the fingers:
yea, sometime with noise or rumbling: and increases more when the party uses
any bathing, or yet stretchinge out of the belly. inward causes are
windiness: and the tumor then is saufte, yelding a sound at the striking of
the fingers, and vanishes when it is pressed upon, etc.

In the cure you are to consider if windiness be any cause: C^re.
and so to discuss the same if need be, with these convenient medicines: as
Mithridatum drunk with the decoction of Rewe, or a clister made in this wise:

may make this medicin: Rec. lixiuij, li.ij. sulphuris viui triti,.ij. b^racis,

if it be possible, such as be astringent and consolidatiue: as these plasters:
for example: Rec. perfoliatae^ q.s. boil it in water o^ wine, then stamp it,

these dissolved in wine, use them as is aforesaid. An unguent for that purpose
you may thus compound. Rec. aluminis scissilis,.v. faecis vini,.j. olci

thickenesse of honey: therewith anoint the affected place, layinge aloft

If medicines may not prevail, but that handie operation is necessarily, to
the cure required: then thus shall you accomplish it. The man standing or
^itting upright, command to hold his breath, so as his body may swel out at
full: then take a pen with ink, and circle round about the compass of the
swelled nauel: after lay down the man upright, and with your scarrifying
lancet, trick the place round about, as the pen did go, ^o that, it become
rough with your searifyings: then with a hook, taking hold of the place, in
the midst of the circle, and therewith eleuating or drawing it up, have
ready a band to tie it, about the scarified place, (for so shall it hold for
going back the better,) leaving a bow knott upon the same tyall: this done,
open the tumor so tied, in the top of it, and put in your forefinger, to
assaye, whether any fold of the guts, or else part of Omen^um, be bound
in with all. And if a gutt be held in the tiall, draw the knotte and slack
the band aforesaid, to put it in again.

But if it be the kell you find, draw forth the overplus part of it, and
cut it of, tying first the vessels, if you find any where you cut it. next,
take two needles, with either of them a single thread, and thrust them through,
in crossewise both sides of the gappe, made by incision: and with those iiij.
ends, knitte together, close up the wound hard, taking off the former band.
And when the parts thus bound with tyings, shall putrify, and fall away.
Apply with linte, convenient medicines to the wound, and heal it up: coveting
in this case, always a hollow cicatrice.

CHAP. XXX. Epiplocele, and Enterocele.
Def.
EPiplocele, is when the kell falls into Scrotum. Enterocele, when the
intestine Ileon does so.

Causes and signs.
The outward causes hereof may b^ strokes, leaping, labor, showting, or crying,
vehement moving, etc. which by the patients relation is understood. Inward
causes are either rupture, or relaxation. Ruptures happen in the sides of the
hucke bones, near the setting to of the belly, after some stroke, fall,
leaping etc. the swelling thereof in the beginning, is not great, but only in
process of time. the pain is pricking. Relaxations ar always about the hole,
through which, the vessels and muscles cremasteres, descend to the testicles:
this tumor is without pain, but (in some persons) of great quantity, uneven,
increasing, and decreasing. Now Enterocele, and Epiplocele are to be
distinguished, by the signs proper to them both. For in Epiplocele the tumor
is small, and oftener in the bone pubis, then in scroto. In whether place
soever it be, it is like a sauftishe bounche, slipperie and uneven: remaining
after one manner always, as well after, as before meat. Neither does it swell
more by the straining of the breath, as the manner of Enterocele is: neither
does it return backwarkes. In Enterocele, the Tumor is sauft, and soudenly
rising, increases by strayning of the voice, or repletio^ of meat, but
contrariwise withdraws it self backwarde, through cold or upright lying.
Likewise being put vpwardes toward the flank, it makes a noise, like as wind
in the guts, being stirred. By feeling many times the excrements may be
perceived in them, hardened: so as they cannot be avoided, like as is seen
also in Iliaca passi^.

Prog.
Enterocele, of all other is most perilous: specially, if the intestine cannot
be put up: and again in some that have had the same put up, there has followed
singultuous fevers, and death it self at the length. To others again, whilst
it could not be put up, has happened Gangraena. Epipl^cele is, by reason of
his sauftnes, hardly reduce^. Yet Enterocele that is new may be cured with
medicines, but that which is aged, is not cured but by manual operation.
Likewise, if Enterocele grow on the left side, it is worse: because colon with
many foldes finisheth his course on that side: and is laid upon with many
of the small guts.

First. that that descended must be put up again, into his place. Cure.
To that purpose therefore, with a decoction of Mallows first mollify the
place: then lay the party with his heels somewhat high, and his legs
abroad, and so by little and little, reduce the kell or intestine, (whether it
be) into the place again. And by and by, bind it up, with a convenient
trusse, whether of clothes, wood, yro^, or such like devise: so that the inside
of the boulster, and those parts that are to come nere scrotum, and the flank,
be covered and ouerlined with some sauft and gentle substance. When you have
thus first provided, to put every thing in his proper place: it stands you
next in hand by all means, so to hold and keep them still: if it be a
rupture, by conglutinatiues, and if it be a relexation by constringent
medicines. For the diet therefore, ordain, that the patient may rest for
many days: lyinge on a saufte bed, meats being of good juice, and
somewhat astringente, his bellye kept loose, and that in goinge to stool, he
ever observe to press his hand upon Pubis, and scrotum, the better to prevent
the fallinge down of any thing. Let him beware of strayninge his voice, or
wind: of too much mouinge, of repletion or fillinge ^with meat and drink: of
the bath of honyed water, of windy meats, and of all kind of fruits, and
pulse. then for medicinal engines, you may provide Medicines sufficient, both to
minister inwardly, and also to apply outwardly, to stop the mouth of so
tedious an enemy: remembering (a^ I said before) that against the rupture, you
strive with medicines desiccatiue, consolidatiue, and constringent. But if it
be a laxation, with astringents only: for which purposes I have set you down
here, both inward and outward medicines convenient. And first, simples to give
inwardly, for this purpose, are the juice of consolida mayor, and regalis, the
juice of Iacea, and of sigillum salomonis. Also, syrupur iaceae, puluis
consolidae maioris, herniaria, radix pentaphilli trita, and cum vino sumpta,
radix cyperi, radix plantag. radix aristologiae longae, and rotundae, scori^
ferri, corralium, pri^pus t^uri, cerui etc. Compoundes of those and such like,
you may provide on this wise: and first for a potion: Rec. Radicum bistonae,

patient take the quantity of a nutte fasting, and drink thereupon a little

Now if the ruptur be old, then it requires to be cured only by manual
working: as either incision, or Here Wecker supposes cauterization, to be a
several kind of manual cure: whereas AEgineta (whence he seems ^o have it)
shows it to be a part of the cure attempted by incision, according to some
men's order.
burning. The cure by incision therefore is in this sort accomplished. Three
days together, before you determine to make incision, let the party drink
water only, and the very day before, abstain from meat also. Then lay him
upright, and let your assistant l^ft up the skin in the flank, whilst you
make incision, with an overthwart line, or in transuerse manner. Some
notwithstandi^ge do make their incision not overthwart, but longwayes: and so
with a hook, draw open the division: which must be in largeness aunswerable
to the quantity of the testicle: then fastening so many hooks in the inner
skin, as the largenes of the wound requires, and excoriating as you go, the
membrans and fatt, divide still forward with your knife, until you have bared
peritonaeum: which done, put down your finger into scrotum, and divide the
testicle from all his holds therein, and so with one hand drawing up
peritonaeum, and with the other, thrusting scrotum inward, to bear upward
the testicle, Take it out, by the place of incision, together with his membran
Erythrois: which one of your assistants lifting up, search you in the mean
time, both that it be perfectly loosed from all his hinder holds in scrotum,
and also that red membran Erythrois be fre from al inuolutions of the kell or
guts, (which you shall put in their place, if you find any) this done, take a
sufficient needle, with a double threede of ten twistes, and in the place of
the incision, thrust it through the midst of the end of Peritonaeum, and taking
the four ends of your double threede, bind them strongly acrosse, one over
another, in the form of this letter X, and that with a double knott: See
Aegi^ li. 6. ca. 65.
so as none of the nutrient vessels, may pass any nourishment from them, for
fear of inflammation. Also outwardly, two fingers from the other, give another
binding. After which things, (leaving the length of a finger of peritonaeum,)
cut off all the rest together with the testicle. Last of all, divide scrotum
again in the lower part, and put through a drawing tente, and so fomenting the
place with oil, and applying convenient ligatures, afte^ the manner taught in
Hernia aquosa, perform that business. Some, when they cut away the membran
called Erythrois, do cauterize the end with a hot iron, for fear of flux
of blood.

ANNOTATION.
aHere Wecker supposes cauterization, to be a several kind of manual cure:
whereas AEgineta (whence he seems ^o have it) shows it to be a part of the
cure attempted by incision, according to some men's order.

CHAP. XXXI. Cirs^cele.
Def.
CIrsocele is a varicous rupture, (so called) when the veins nourishinge the
testicle, do swell.

Signs.
The tumor is but small, and of a diverse fourm, both in the By epididime is

epididime and spermatike vessels, which are thereby (as it were) heaped and
wouen together, and writhen. It is hard, and in figure long, easy to be
perceived in feeling. It is less grievous then Hernia carnosa. If it be of any
notable grows or continuance, Prog.
it is hardly or never cured, but by handy work.

The cure therefore is to be labored with mollyfying medicines: Cure.
as, faenum graecum, semen lini, farina frumenti, ol. sesaminum etc. or else
with handy operation, which is thus to be performed. First, place your patient
decently for your purpose^ then stroking scrotum gently with your hand, drive
the nerve Wecker has this at the hand of Paul AEg. who is commonly known to
be deceived in his opinion of Cremaster, howbeit, the substance of the cure is
contained in that that follows, namely, the tying, and empting of the
vessels, wherein I wish this to be observed: that before the lower tyall, next
to the testicle be made, the vessels first be opened, and the thick dreg^gish
blood contained both in them and the ^esticle, be let out.
^remaster into the lower part, you shall easilye know it by this: that it is
a slenderer, stronger, harder, and solider vessel then the rest, and the
patient at the thrusting down thereof will complain, feeling himself troubled
about the yard. Then the dilated vessels, beeinge taken up with scrotum, See
Aeg^^ li. 6. ca. 6^^
between the fingers of you and your assistant, and hard stretched, cut
slopewise, with your incision knyfe, through the skin that lies directly
over them. After that, liftinge up the vessels with hooks, when you have
bared, and separated them from their holds in the skin, and other parts,
pearse them through with a needle, and double threede: then cutting off the
needle, bind the vessels, both in the place of their first dilatation or
enlarging, as also in the lower end of the same. This done, make incision
along upon them, and empty out the blood contained. Lastly, with medicines
that move matter, effect the cure, and so that the bindinges together with the
vessels, may fall away of their own accord.

See Aegin. loc. cit.
This course must be taken (says Leonides) when some of the nutrient vessels
are varicous, or dilated^ otherwise, if all the vessels be in like case, then
are they to be cut off, and the testicle to be taken away with them.

of Epiplocele. The disease it self, being a visible tumor, in the place
mentioned is easy to be discerned by the eye.

Let the diet and medicines in this cure, Cure.
be the same that is set down in Epiplocele, and Enterocele. And if the kel or
guts be slipped outward, put them in again, and so with convenient trusses, or
flank binding, hold them there. There are also further means used ^f these
serve not: as incisio^ and cauterie: both which I will here set down unto you.
Incision.
And first the incision thus: divide the swelled part of the flank, with an
ouertwhart incisio^, the breadth of three fingers long, take out the membrans
and fat: then with a probe ^et upon peritonaeum, where it poynteth out, bear it
down, thereby to compel again the intrels into their place. And this do every
where, whereas it bouncheth out: in the mean time, sowinge together the breach
with a convenient seame, then pluck forth the probe: and thus neither cuttinge

and by themselves, or else by consent of some other part, after this sort. If
there be any consent, as of the Liver, or Spleen, examine the state of those
parts, by the proper signs and notes of the livers affects, and of the
dropsey: and if you find faultiness in those parts, then is there consent:
but if those parts be sound, and there no signs of dropsey, the tumor also
vnpainfull, firm and abiding, you easily see where all the fault must be
laid.

To go about this cure: Cure.

by often purgations. In vain else shall you go about to lay local medicines

Shave away the hair (if there be any) from scrotum, and pubis, and lay the
patient upright on a form, with many foldes of cloth under his hippes, but
under scrotum a sponge of sufficient largeness: your self sitting at the
leftside of the party, your assistant on the right: appoint him to turn the
yard to a side, and lift up the skin of scrotum to abdomen ward: then make
your incision from the midst of scrotum, up along, almost to ^s pubis, and

division, even down to the membran Erythrois. If you find humor, gathered in

in double wise endeavoring the cure, by incision on both sides of scrotum,
toward the flanks, which done, put in your probe by the wound, down to the
bottom of scrotum, and when you have wrought with the head of your probe, such
a dent or pit, on the in^ide of the skin of scrotum, that you can perceive
on the other side where the head of the probe lies, against the same cut
through scrotum with the edge of your incision knife, so much as may serve to
give issue to the matter, or cluttered blood contained, and with the same head
of the p^obe pluck in a long drawinge tent, or linen cloth, which may come
through the orifice above. This done, apply to the testicle Wool wet in oil,
and aloft outwardly, other pieces, wet in oil and wine, and besides dooynge
this to scrotum, lay the like battes of oil and Wine also to the bottom of
the bellye, to the flanks, to the loins, and along the space between scrotum
and the fundament. So aloft on al, make your enwrapping with a linen cloth,
three fold, contrived with six strappes or boughtes, and other convenient
bindings for the purpose, letting the party keep his bed, and boulstring up
scrotum with wool, that it may lie at ease: providing always to lay under the
same woll, some soft leather skin, for the receiving of the fomentations,
that will be always syping through: for you must foment the place with hot oil
till the third day. The third day, the wound being opened, dress it again
with tetrapharmacum, and change the long tent that went through. Also yet
foment the parts without until the vij. day: for fear of inflammation: and
apply aloft some plaster, to keep in the tents. The wound being by those
means purged, and flesh in a reasonable measure engendered, wash the place,
draw out the long tent, and accomplish the rest of the cure, as has been
said in other like before. Now if there come any inflammation, or flux of
blood, or such like, it is meet to make convenient resistance by their proper
remedies: which here I stand not upon, lest I should make needelesse
repetitions of the same things, in fitter places delivered.

CHAP. XXXV. Of Pneumatocele.
Def.
PNeumatocele is a windy rupture or bursting. The mediate cause is cold
distemperature etc.

Causes and signs.
The immediate, wind: and that either in the four nourishing vessels of the
testicles, (the tumor then appearing hard and not vanishing by the pressing of
the finger) or else in the arteries running betwixt the tunicles of Here still

the finger. Now, if the parts be affected first, and by them selves, then
shall you see no signs of dropsy or timpanie, nor of any affect of the liver,
or stomach, then by the proper signs of the affectes of those parts, as also
by the notes of those named diseases, you shall descrie it. In brief, the
general signs of windy rupture, are these: The ^ump^ is through shining,
lighter in poyse, and yelding more sound or noise, than in Hydrocele.

If the affect be in the iiij. vessels, nourishing the testicle, Prog.
it is curable, but in the arteries of dartos, incurable. In newborn children
also it often happens, and is easily discussed.

If it come by consent of the liver, or stomach, it is to be dealt withal, as
in the timpanie. So the dropsy is first to be cured, Cure.
if this be occasioned there by. ^ut if the part first, and by it self have
received the affect, and be faulty alone, then is it thus to be dealt with.
The mediate cause, which is, cold distemperature, if it be without matter, it
is the sooner corrected by heating diet and medicines, but if pituitous matter
be joined with it, then must you first alter or concoct it, after ^uacuate the
same matter, by convenient medicines. Now for the immediate cause, which is
windines in the place, you must prepare discutient medicines, such as these: a

astringencie, but in no wise reper cussiue, because to beat back, as it is
not safe, in any of the Emunctories, so, much less in this, so near to that
noble part, which, for the continual resort of superfluities, has need
sometime, of many channels, and ventes, to disburden it self by. Some
astringencie yet, I allow, (I mean in the Parotis not critical, the cure
whereof I will first handle,) lest the fluxion should be too headlong, and
unruly. as for example, a pulteis made, ex medulla panis (I mean wheaten or

wool: so likewise, Rondel^tius.
if you add to the latter cataplasme mel, or frame one ex melle, favina
fabarum, and farina hordei, leuiter coctis: you shall sufficientlye perform
that dewtie. In the end, if there remain any thing, by these undiscussed, the
pain being ceased, apply Diachilon mag. ireatum, Diapalma with double
quantity of chalciteos, and some of the powder of Ireos, or diapalma mixed with
proportionable quantities of bdellium and Ireos. If it bend to suppuration,

The antecedent cause is abundance of blood, either in the whole body, or in

conioynd cause is blood now driven into the affected part, whereof comes

inflammations. We taking it likewise in the same larger sense, do divide it
into two kinds: simple and malign. The simple is that that follows humorall
fevers, or pains of any parts: which also varieth his name, according to the
place wherein, or humor whereof it is engendered. The place, as if it be beehind
the ears, and then it is called Parotis, or in the flank, and so called
properly Bubo. They that are discerned for the humor where of they spring are
Ph^ma, which comes of ^incerer blood, and therefore sooner suppurateth, and
Phygeth^on which consists more of coler. Now the malign Bubo, is to be
divided into venereus and pestilent: which follow here to be treated of.

pain, heat, etc. First in this case, Cure.
you must deal with the conjoined cause, to wit, the blood driven now into
the affected part: which, if it come slowlyer, must be drawn by means and
helps: as fomenting the place with oil and warm water: or with some epitheme,
of the decoction of Lilies, althea. malowes, violets, linseede, and Fenugreke.
Or further drawing may you use, with cupping glasses, if so be that need
require. Giving the patient daily, some tryacle or other proper Aexipharmacum.
Now if the matter be of a swifter motion, and gather redely unto the place,
then discuss the same first with gentler means, afterward with stronger. The
gentler means: Recipe ol. liliorum,.j. ol. Chamomillae, ss. misce. Another:

it is not in the beginning to be euacuated, (for hindringe natures motion)
but some days put between, lest the party fall into the venereous disease.
The same contagious humor (therefore) is to be emptied partly by bloudletting,
(if nothing hinder) and partly by purging medicines, instituted according to the
nature of the body, and humors, etc.

Finally, (to prosecute the cure by maturation, as is a little above said)
when it is ripe fully, and also opened, (either of it self, or by instrument,
as need requires) it is to be dealt withal, with clensing medicines, first
of gentler sort, then stronger, after with incarnatiues, and so to
cicatrization, as has been often before remembered.

Supply. CHAP. XLI. Bubo Pestilens.
THis is that Tumor in the pestilence that lights in the emunctories. The
signs are a small swelling at the first and mouable, but in feeling to the
sick, as a load or burden. Differences in (...) cause (...) Bubo (...) the
^^^^buncle.
Also with much pain and lack of sleep, etc. Causes are the same with the
Carbuncle, save that the authors make this difference: that the Carbuncle
comes of hot adusted blood, but Bubo of the more phlegmatike part. This
tumor is to end by suppuration: being otherwise a messenger of evil news.
Cure.
It must be drawn forward, by all such means as are mentioned in the
Carbuncle: and suppuration speedily furthered. Therefore besides the inner
helps, by Alexipharmackes, to assist nature to the thrusting forth of the
venom, as also the outward, by cupping glasses, (if the matter flow but
slowly) set on every six hours, till the place be sufficiently gathered, you
may grow to this cataplasme: Iul. Pal. loc. cit.
which you may also begin withal, in such places as you need no cupping
glasses: Recipe rad. symphiti maioris, liliorum, ceparum, ana,.j. fol.

it as a cataplasme to the tumor. The matter being sufficientlye collected,
bring it to ripeness by these means: Recipe fol. oxalidis, cum butyro salis
expexte, in pilam componantur, coquantur su^ prunis, tundantur, and adiecto
vng. basilici duplo, in cataplasma coaptantur. To this you may add, in the

lightly draws, but in hot matter sharpeneth the pain. After the matter is
thus made ready, make speedy issue, or vent, by incision^ or causticke. Then
have your mundificatiue, ex melle, farinis, and vitellis ouorum, your
incarnatiue such as this: Recipe masticis, thuris, myrrh^, cerussae, tutiae,

CHAP. XLII. Cruddeling of Milk in Women's breasts.
Def.
THis is an engrossinge or thickning of milk in the pappes. It proceeds either
of diste^pered heat, turning the milk: Causes and signs.
The signs whereof are heat, fever, yellowish milk, Relife by cold things,
and such like: or else it is of cold, heaping up, and binding together,
apparent both by the sense of the party, and handling: as also by the sight of
the milk: which is watrish, or viscous and slimie. Also the patient feels
relief by hot things.

Prog.
If this affect be not quickly cured, it brings forth either inflammation, or
vlceration of the pappes.

For the hot cause, appoint the patient a cooling diet, Cure.
as Lettuse by it self, or boyld with flesh, etc her drink Barley water, or
small ale. And if there be plenty of milk, let her breasts be emptied by
sucking. Cooling medicines for that purpose are these: succus solani cum aceto,
applied: or, succus portulacae, or, morsus gal^in^e cum aceto: or, suc. apij
cum aceto, and farina ^icerum: or, suc. coriandri cum ol. ros. and aceto. Also,
farina hordei cum aceto mulso, aut cum posca: or, furfures in aceto cocti, cum
rutae decocto, etc. In a cold cause, let the diet be heating and extenuating.
The medicines also of property, to warm and make thin, as these: Mentha
co^tusa, and cum farina hora^i and faenugraeci, altheae and sem. lini. ol. ros.
and pauco aceto permixta, and applied, lentes muria decoctae, and applied,
cuminum cum modico ^roco, applied: or, decoctum faenigraeci and altheae, sem.
apij: also, ol. chamomelinum, anethinum, amygdal. dulcium. Coagulum leporinum,
cum butyro and pauco aceto: or, Coagul^m cum vino potum: or, succus caulium,
morellae, coriandri, portulacae, cum aceto and farina ^ordei, mixta omnia
simul. atque in formam emplastri redacta: or, succus apij cum aceto and farina
cecerum, etc.

CHAP. XLIII. Inflammation of the pappes.
MEdiate causes are, plenty of blood, cluttering or abundance of milk.
Causes and signs.
Of abundance of blood in cause, the signs are pain in back,
shoulder-blades, and armepittes, suppression of menstruous course, pain,
heat, fever, with other signs of blood abounding. Of cluttered milk the
signs are manifest. So childlabour near hand, or new fulfilled, argues the
part to be inflamed through store of milk. Then is there less redness,
heat, etc. The immediate cause is hot distemperature: The badges whereof are,
fever, heat, pain, etc.

Prog.
The substance of the pappes being open and kernellie, not much abounding with
inborne heat, it is doubtful lest the inflammation g^owe to Scirrhus or
Cancer: e^ther else being suppurate, and coming to abscesse, an eating ulcer
follow. Wherefore the cure of it, is in no wise to be neglected.

Cure.
If it be for plenty of blood, or milk, ordain a cooling diet, and let there
be frication of the thighs, moderate sleep, the belly kept solluble, with
clisters, or potions ex cassia, or manna, etc. her meat diminishing blood,
such as Beetes boiled with butter and vinegar, sodden apples, toastes in
drink, rere eggs with juice of Orenges, abstaininge from flesh broth, etc.
Her drink, Barley water, or small ale, or the decoction of Cinamon^ And for
quantity, let the patient be spare, in all her diet.

In the beginning the patient may have blood taken, in proportionable
quantity, for her plenty, and strength: and that in her inner ancle (if her
inferior course have failed) or else in the Median, or Basilica of the Cubite:
applying (withal) outwardlye, medicines meanly repelling: as posca cum
spongia, or decoctum chamomillae, cum oleo rosac. and aceto, folia solani cum
butyro, and oleo contusa. Or, Palmulae in posca and oleo ^lixae, deinde
malaxatae, or, succus coriandri c^m rosaceo, etc.

But in the augmentation, digerent and discutient remedies, as this Epitheme:
Recipe florum Chamomillae, meliloti, altheae, faenigraci, semen lini and
anethi, ana, manipul^ j. coquantur in aqu^, cui add oleum rosarum, anethini,
ana,.ij. aceti,.j. herein a sponge being wett, apply to the pappes: or a
plaster: ex farina fabarum, faenigraeci^ sem. lini, and hordei, and
panecontrito, in aqua decoctis, cum oleo anethino, additis duobus vitellis
ouorum, ac croci a^que myrrhae, ana,.j. else, ex farina fabarum cum melle. In
the state, make your medicines maturatiue (especially, if the former have
nothing auailed) such as these: folia maluae in hydraeleo clixa. radix maluae:
vis^i, fol. maluae cum axungia porci malaxa^a: or, farina triticea cum
hydreleo. The tumor being ripe, procure the opening by instrument, or sharp
medicines, etc. If crudeling of the milk was occasion of the inflammation,
have respect to the Chapter going before. In the rest of the cure, proceed by
abstersiues, conglutinatiues. etc.

Supply. CHAP. XLIIII. Inflammation of scrotum and the testicles.
AS this comes sometime of outward occasions: Causes and signs.
as strokes, bruses, and other evil applications: so also of sudden inward
defluxions, and that very often. The signs are manifest.

For diet and bloudletting, observe the rules of ordinary inflammations. Cure.
Loosing of the belly (which in this case also must needs be respected,) is
best to be done by clyster, except the body be such, as is easily moved, by the
lighter means otherwise. Your local medicines must be framed (likewise)
according to the times of the inflammation, as thus for example: Rondel.
in the beginning: Beginning
Rec. suc^i plantag. vel solani, li.j^ far. hordei, li ss. ros. rub. cort. mali
granati, ana,.j. ol. ros..iiij fiat cataplasma: or this, which both repelleth
and discusseth: Augment.
Rec. vrinae pueri, li.j. aceti alb. fortiss. li. ss. aquae ros rub..ij.

it to the testicle, and to the vessels descending thereunto. If you would have
it a cataplasme you may bring it to the form, cum fa^ina fabarum: or, Rec.
vrinae pu^ri, li.ss. panis furfuraceae, in lacte recen^i in fusae, li.j.
mellis,.iiij fiat cataplasma, which is also good in con^usions and to assuage
pain: like as is also, that ordinary one: consistinge ex^ lacte, and farina
fabarum. ^tate.
If the pain be such, as urges to suppuration: Rec. maluae, rad. bismaluae,
an. m.j. far. ^rumenti..iij. far. faenugraeci, and sem. lini, an^, ij. ol.
viol, pingued. por^^ ana,.iij. decoque, and contusa per cribrum transmittantur,
fia^que cataplasma. Declin.
If yet the pain continue, decoquantur folia hyos^iami sub cineribus, and
contusa excipiantur axungia porci, reducanturque ad formam cataplasmatis, and
so apply it. It alayeth pain, and ripeneth the inflammation. If the tumor do
by these means resolve and vanish, pursue it with a cataplasme ex farina
orizae, vel cicerum, vel orobi, cum oxymellite, vel sapa, vel vino: or, with a
plaster, ex chalcitide, brought into the form of ^ cerote, cum oleo antiquo,
vel ane^hino, vel rutaceo, vel irino. Otherwise, if it decline not, but
suppurate: procure the opening by instrument, or as you shall think good, and
finish the rest of the cure, as is said in other inflammations. If there ensue
a Schirrous hardness (as it attends on every inflammation not justly
ordered.) First soften it with mollifying fomentations, as ex amygdal. dulc.
lil. oleo dulci, vel in sapa decoctis, vel butyro recenti, vel axungia porci
non antiqua exceptist afterward disperse the matter with digerent oils: as
amygdal. amar. irino, antiquo, rutac. aneth. Or some cerote ex diachalcit. cum
gummi and ol. amygdal. or such like.

Last of all, as a wonderful cataplasme, this is commended of Rondeletius:
Recipe radic. mandragor. recent. li. ss. hyosciami and alchecengi, ana,
manipulum, j. decoquantur in sapae, and per c^ibrum simul contusa mittantur:
quibus add rad panacis,.ij. (vel loco ^ius opoponacis in eodem decocto
liquati) fiatque adformam emplast^i: addendo cere parum, vel ad formam
cataplasm. addendo styracis.ss.

As for such Tumor in this part, as proceeds of cold and dull humors, and
so of longer congestion: he that is exercised in the cure of Oedematous
tumors, cannot be unfurnished to deal with them.

ANNOTATION.
Here I omit the tumors of the yard, both inward and outward, as brooches of
the french disease: which in this book I handle no^, par^ly, because mine
author has not led me, (though he have touched some things thereof) but
specially because some of our countriemen do in absolute treatises handle it
of purpose: Who (I doubt not) will never cease, until they have brought their
good intent to a full measure of perfection, for that point, not only
concerning the maine disease it self, but even for all those symptoms beside,
that deserve any several respect therein.

Of the tumors of the limbs or extreme members. CHAP. XLV. Paronychia.
Def.
PAronychia, is an abscesse, or inflammation, gathering in the roots of the
nails.

The antecedent cause is blood inflowing, Causes and signs.
which you may descrie by the notes of abundance of blood, the conioined cause
is the blood contained in the part affected, etc. This tumor is about the
roots of the nails, the pain is vehement, with pulsation, heat, etc.

This tumor sometimes is found with grievous symptoms, as pain, so great,
that it purchases a fever, alienation of the mind, and sounding, and so ends
by death sometimes. Again, it vlcerateth, and brings an eating and
corrupting both of the flesh, and bone, and so consequently a Gangraene, or
Sphacele, and perdition of the whole finger, etc. The blood inflowing (which
is said to be the antecedent cause) is first to be driven out, Cure.
and that either from the region or seat, whence it flows, whether it be
from the whole body, or a part, (as by bloudletting and diet, as is said in
Phlegmon) or else from the part whether it does flowe^ and gather: and this
may you do two manner of ways: one way is by reuulsion, to wit, in pulling
away to a contrary part, that which is drawn toward the part affected,
which is done both by blood letting (if no thing withstand) and cupping: these
being done on an opposite or contrary part. Another way to remo^e the matter
from the seat whether it gathers, is, by repellent medicines: as vnguentum
album cum caphura, vng. Populeon. Or, Recipe succi portulac^, succi solani,
succi plantag. succi vmbeli^i veneris, ana,.ij. mucilaginis Psillij.ij. boli

^yosciamo cocto cum axungia, and mucilagine psillij, vel maluae. Sometime, in
special pain, you may use opij.j. cum lacte, croco, and vitello oui. Now the
blood gathered and contained in the affected part: (called the cause conioynd)
if it be thin, and fit for resolution, must be discussed and spent out, by
using first warm wine, and after oil of roses. But if it be thick and
rebellious to resolution, maturate the same, with this unguent: Recipe

filthy, either, cum melle, terebynthina, and hordei farina, and vnguento
apostolorum. Or else, with the powder of Mercury, if need require. After,
when it neede^h to be filled with flesh, provide this unguent: Recipe myrrhae,
thuris, sarcocollae, ana,.j. aloes,.iij. terebynthinae,.v. mellis ros. col..ij.
misce. If the pain be great, it must be mittigated by the means aforesaid.
If there be corruption or perishinge of the bone, there must be use of
Cauterie, etc.

CHAP. XLVI. Of Wartes, and corns, to wit, Myrmecia, Acrochordone, Clauo, and
Thymio.
THere are four kinds of wartes, as Mi^mecta, Def.
which is a small, callous, round and thick tubercle, sitting with a broad
foundation, and yelding a sense like to the biting of a pissemire, or ante,
when it is handled.

Acrochordon is a hanging kind of warte, standing of a slenderer botom,
callous, round and without paine^ Clauus is a round callous warte, Corn, or
^g^aile.
of color white, fashioned like the head of a nail, growing upon the toes
and soles of the feet, and procuring pain in going. Thymon is a little warte
appearing upon the body, slender beneath, like Acrochordon, but at top
brother, very rough and somewhat hard. It grows in the beginning of the
foot, palms of the hands, or inferior parts and soles of the feet, the
vylest of all, is that that grows in the unclean or secret parts.

^^^ses and ^^nes.
The cause of Wartes is a thick humor: for the most part, melancholic, when
as the Wartes are of blackish color, the temperature of the body,
melancholic, the patients diet, cold and dry, etc. But otherwise flegmatike:
when the warts are of whitlie color, and the temperature and diet flegmaticke,
they are known one from another, by these notes. Myrmecia has a brother root,
and slenderer top then Thymon. It is lower, harder, fuller of pain, and
less subject to bleedinge then Thymon, and scarce, at any time, exceeding the
greatness of a Lupine. Acrochordon is slenderer in the bottom, broader in the
top, always standing out from the skin, seeldome growing greater then a
bean, most commonly incident to children: sometime turning to matter,
otherwhiles, suddenly going away: and now and then moving in some measure an
inflammation. Also they grow many in number, etc. Clauus is round, callous,
white, making pain^ to the goer, and specially addicted to the toes, and soles
of the feet. Lastly, those that are referred to Thymus, are eminent and
broader, hard and rough, slender in the lower part, in color, representing
the flowers of Time. Somewhyles they bleed. They grow commonly to the
greatness of the Egyptian bean, Prog.
and are sometimes one, sometimes more in number. Myrmecia goes not away
without curation. It is burned with medicines: it sticks in with broad
roots, so that it cannot be cut out, without a great vlceration.

Ac^ochordon often times cease by it self. If it be cut out it leaves no root
behind, therefore, neither does it grow again. with medicies it may be
burned.

Claui go not away without curation. If they be cut you shall see a round
root underneath, which descends down even to the very flesh. The same root
being left behind in cutting, the corn or Agnayle grows again. by cutting
or burning, they are most redily cured.

Thymon often vanishes away of it self. If it be cut away, there grows a
round root underneath, as in Clauus. It is cured by eating or consuming
medicines.

Cure.
The cure of all which, both universally and particulerly, you shall prosecute
in this manner. If the thick humor (which we have noted before, to be the
cause of this disease) be melancholic, bend your fo^ce to the taking of it
away, first by blood letting, if nothing hinder, and the body appear
aboundinge with blood: then with a diet heatinge and moystninge, and
engendringe good blood: and thirdly by medicines: to wit, such, first, as
prepare and alter the quality of the humor: as oxymel scilliticum, oxymel
compositum, syrupus de epithymo, de fumoteriae, de lupulis, etc. then such as
purging, diminish the quantity manifestly. Such simples are these, senna,
epi^hymum, elleborus niger, etc. Compoundes: diasenna, d^acatholicon, confectio
hamech. If the humor be pituitous or Phlegmatike, then instituting first, a
diet that may divide, or scatter, and make thin, prepare the humor with
medicines of the like quality, and then purge it with Diaphe^i^um, Benedicta
laxatiua, Elect. Indum, etc. The causes thus gainstoode, come then to deal
with the affectes themselves, which you shall do either by medicines, or
manual operation. Let your medicines be resolutiues lightly astringent, and
proceeding in them (as you need) from the weaker sort to the stronger, and
more vehement, like as here you have examples of all sorts: the gentler, oleum
phisticorum, oleum frumenti, ol. de Been. oleum sulphuris, ol. lini, etc. cera
rubra, succus chelidonij, etc. also succus calthae cum sale, caput lacertae,
aqua ex sarmentis viridibus, dum comburuntur, cum nigella, etc. the vehementer
sort are these corroding medicines: as Calx, arsenicum, cinis, sal Alcali,
Cantarides, mel anacardi, lac Tithymalli, flos aeris, sal cum aqua raphani,
fimus ouillus, etc. Whe^eof you may prepare you compounded ones on this sort:
as one, ex cinere salicum, cum aceto, vel, ex nigella, cum vrina: vel, ex
sterc^re bouis cum aceto, vel, fimus ouillus, cum aceto: another ex flore
aeris, sulphur, aqua^ sarmento^um viridium vstione extillata, simul mixtis: a
third, Recipe floris aeris, chartae vstae, ana, v. colo^ynthidis, baurach,
ana,.vj. salis ammoniaci..ss. salis alkali, ar^enici, ci^rini, fellis vaccini,
ana,.vj. vsneae persici,.vij. terantur, and cum aqua saponis fiat lixi^ium. The
manual operation is three foulde, to wit, incision, ligature, (which must be
cunningly administered) and vstion or burning: in the which operation, you must
have an iron plate, or such like matter, with a hole in it, made fit, to couch
close about the borders of the warte, that you will cauterize, so that none of
the sound skin about it, may appear through the same, then the cauterie
being set on as far as needs, resolve the crust with butter, or some
unctuous thing, that it may loose, and afterward cure the place, as other
vlcerations. Observe here among (as there is always an eye to be had to the
accidents) that lest any pain, inflammation or exulceration should chance
to the parts, (as they are apt to come by means of burning medicines) you
do, in the using of the remedies, (for the more security sake) defend the
parts lying round about, with an unguent made ex bolo armeno, terrae
sigillata, aqua rosacea and aceto, or such like. Hitherto has been spoken of
the common cure of all these wartes, now to their special cures, ^peciall cure.
wherein is some varying, according to their several differences: so those
that be called Myrm^ci^, are to be cured, partly by medicines eating, or
corroding, partly by chirurgerie. Of that sort of medicines are, alumen,
Chalcanthum, sandaraca, caput lacertae, succus arboris ficus, elaterium cum
sale, cortex thuris cu^ aceto, ruta cum nitro and pipere, nitru^ cu^ vrina,
stercus bouis cum aceto, etc. capu^ piscis smaridis, salsum and vstum. By
chirurgerie also, as first s^arifying them, and then catching hold of them,
with a mullet, cut them out, with an incision knife, like as you do corns.
another way is practiced, by drawing and sucking them first into the mouth for
a space, and then soudenly biting them clean out, with the foreteeth: some do
yet otherwise: to wit, first scarifie them in the extreme part, the^ with a
brass or iron pipe, or old goose quill, thrust into the bottom of it, do
sprittle it up by the roots. Acrochordon^s are to be removed, either by
ligature, cutting, burning or biting. Claui, or corns are cured, parley by
medicines, partly by surgery, the medicines being resolving, as faex vini,
fellupi pisc. cera rubra, aq. for^is, etc. or this prepared plaster: Rs. ^mp.
diachy lonis magni,.ss. resinae sutoru^,.ss. salis,.ij. mix them, and the same
being ^pread on a cloth, apply it to the corn changing it every fourth day.
It is a proved one. The chirurgical administration in this, is incision, and
burning: the order of both which, are before set down. Thymi are done away,
partly also by medicines, as are cinis salicum cum aceto. or cum ficubus in
aqua coctis: and partly by chirurgerie, namely ligature: which is by binding
the same very surely and strongly, with a silk thread, and still more and more
girding it, till it fall off: afterward cu^ing the same, like to other ulcers.
And in this sort are they best cured, which grow in the unclean, or privy
parts. There may come in use, in this cure, also both incision and burning
with fire, and hot yrons, or such other: which orders have now been often
enough repeated.

Supply. CHAP. XLVII. Tumor in the knee.
TVmors in the knee, whether they be inflamed, oedematous, or flatuouse, need
no several tractation, this being observed, that there be greater heed taken,
when there is use of incision, and more corroborating and strengthening means,
in the process of every such cure, then in other ordinary places, for the
joints sake, and synewye parts there lodged.

VArix is an unmeasurable dilatation or enlarging of a vein, the place is (most
commonly) the legs. It comes of some stroke, co^tusion, much labor,
strayning and travail, Causes and signs.
sometime of filling and swelling of the body, as in women with child. The
vein thus enlarged looks blacker than others: sauft, easily yielding to the
finger, and soon returning. It breaks out in the end to a filthy and
intractable ulcer: Prog.
sometime the vein bursting soudainly, daungereth the party of death by
bleeding. If withal the patient have a stitch in his side, De Apost. c. 25.
then judge the disease to be tending toward death, says Paracelsus.

This cure has two considerations, Cure.
to wit, as the disease is young, and as it is inueterate. The growing of it is
to be cut off, by strengthening and astringent local means: inwardly withal
providing, that melancholic juice increase not. Outward means are these
simples: bolus armenus, terra lemnia, nux cupressi, gallae, acacia, hyposistis,
thus, cyperus, iragaganthum, hordei farina, etc. Of which may be made
fomentations and cataplasmes, or apply them mixed cum oui albumine and aceto:
profitable also is Emplastru^ contra Rupturam and such others, likewise a roll
dipped in vino austero, or other decoction of astringent things, and applied
from the ankle to the knee is much commended. If you require more ample setting
out of the devise of these kinds of medicines, have recourse to Vigo li. 4.
cap. 6. The inueterate Varix (which commonly keeps some periodical turns of
increasing and decreasing) must be opened and vented in his periodes: or (as I
may speak) in the determinate season of his pride and rage^ as once a year,
if it return but once: or else twice, if twice it do advance it self.
Afterward always, for three weeks or a month, annoint the place daily cum
pinguedine humana, or Balsamo sulphuris: else with them mixed together, as you
shall see it good, binding up the member afterward, with a strengthening
lygature. Thus shall the feculent blood, at fittest opportunities, be emptyed:
(which seems verily to aunsweare natures expectation) and the member
afterward receive dew confirmation and strengthening: this last giving us
assurance, against all further growth of Va^ix: and the former making us
secure^ for the return of any evil upon the principal parts. Which two
points, as they are not sufficiently satisfied by any other ways of curation,
so lest of all (that I may yet speak with reverence toward the inuentors) by
incision. Therefore have I abstained to teach it in this place.

Aneurysma is the like dilatation or enlarging of an arterye. Aneury^^ma.
It is to be known from Varix^ by the great, lifting and (often times)
painful pul^ation that is in it. It is sometime in the inner parts, sometime
in the outter. In the inner parts, as in the breast, or about the spleen and
mesenterium: discernable otherwhiles to the eye: or (at least) notoriouslye
felt of the patient. In the out^r parts, and that either superficiallye, or
deep in the member: the superficial Aneurysma may both be seen and fealt.
The other, though it escape the eye, yet it is easily found out in feeling, by
the extraordinary greatness of his struck. Especially if the vessels be
brooken, and there grow separation of the other continued parts about them,
through their unmeasurable pouring in of spirituous blood: which case, I
content not my self only (here) to touch, but purpose further, by a clear
instaunce to prove it, chiefly for the taking away of the doubt, which the
reverend F^rnelius has put in this behalf. ^7. c. 3.


^istorie.
Not two years passed, a servant of the right honorable, the Lady Marquis of
North. dying of Aneurisma in his thigh, whereof he had long time languished,
with most intolerable pain, I was present at the opening thereof, with
master Goodrus, now chirurgian to her Majesty, and this (of a certainty) the
case was: Incision being made along the thighe, half an ynch deep, or
somewhat more, there was found no further substance of flesh, but
thencefoorth blood, either concrete, or fluent, lodged as in a trunk, from the
flank, down (almost) to the hamme, in quantity about a gallon and a half,
the bone was as a staff thrust through a leather budget: for so had it no flesh
abiding on it, only periosteon covered it. The few fleshie parts and muscles,
yet toward the skin remaining, were daily still in consuming (which we
might judge by the abundance of muscles, and fragmentes, some loose and
swimming in the blood, some separated, others half consumed, yet hanging by
one end) so, as it seems the natural end would have been, by soudaine
efusion of all this blood and spirits, when (at last) the skin and fleshie
parts had all been worn and washed through. Thus much I thought not in vain
in this place to be registered, (if there were no other use of it) even for the
rareness of the observation. It is a desperate disease, Prog.
and (for the most part) utterly incurable: especially if it either grow with
in the bulk of the body, or in the deep parts of any member.

Institute a cooling and thickning order of diet, Cure.
which does ease in all sorts. Against the superficial Aneurisma you have
two scopes of practice: the one preservative, the other curatiue, to preserve the
patient longer in hindering the increase of his disease, beside his order of
living rightly instituted, with some dozell or fit bowlster, laid on the
place, keep the member rolled. If the vessel be not broken, but enlarged
only, then likewise annoint it with such things as serve for the varicous
vain. Now if you attempt the cure, the way is by incision: and that, either as
the vessel is yet whole, or as it is now broken by extreme distention. Lib.
6. Chapter 28.
If it be whole, follow Pareus counsel, in taking up the vessel, then
bynding it abo^e the enlarged part, afterward cutts it quite a sunder, and let
the tiall remaime till it come away of it self: so heal the place again, but
if the vessel be broken, Aetius Tetr. 4. ^^r. 3. c. 10.
then serves the devise of surprising: which is wrought, by taking up, and
knitting the same vessel, where you can find it, above the breach: after
which, you may boldly open the tumor: let out that which was contained, seek
out the broken vessel, and knit it above the breach: then take away the tiall
above, and leave the last till it fall away, in the healing.

THE SECOND BOOK, ENTREAting of wounds, and first in general. Of the
differences of wounds.
THE differences of wounds, are taken either from their causes, by which they
are inflicted: or from their accidents to wit, the place wherein they are
situated^ the causes are either bodies with out life, or else living things.
Things without life that wound a man, do it either by cutting, or brusing: if
it be by cutting, we call it simplye a wound: if it be brusingwise done, we
call it a contused wound, or Ecchymosis. Again it may be of a living body as
a wound that is of biting. Now the place gives difference in this sort:
some wounds chance in the similar, some in the organicall parts. Of the
similar, also, some are sanguin, some spermaticke, so the wounds in the
sanguine parts, as in the flesh, are either, simple, deep, hollow, plain, or
proud with flesh. The spermaticke parts, likewise are either hard or sauft:
the sauft parts be, the sinewe, which being hurt, we call it a wound in the
sinewe: the vein, whose hurt we call a wound in the vein: the artery, whose
wound we call by the like name: the hard spermaticke partes^ are the bones,
a wound in the which, we call a wound of the bones. Wounds of the organicall
or isntrumental parts, are either of some whole bulk or trunk, or some more
particular member or limme. Wounds of the trunkes are meant those of the
head, neck, breast and belly, in the head again, there grow more
particular names and differences, by reason of the parte^ thereof which be of
special note and name: as wounds of the face, eyes, nose, lips, and ears.
Wounds of the limbs are these, to wit, wounds of the shoulders, arms,
thighs and legs.

CHAP. I. Of a green wound.
A Wound is a breach of continuitie, Def.
new, and bloody, with out either matter or putrefaction.

Causes are, Causes
either sword, or such weapons, as may be sent from far to do the hurt: of
which kind, there be diverse fashions, some long and slender, as arrows, both
with plain and bearded heads: others broad, some again round, as bullettes
of lead, or y^on, othersome empoysoned.

Signs of the wound, signs.
as also whether it be in a similar or instrumental part, ar easily discerned
by common sense. The signs yet of the instrument that causes the wound, are
not always so manifest. For although (as is said before) some are stricken at
hand, as with the sword, or such other weapon, yet we know also, that some
hurts are sent further off, which being done by things of small compass, as a
pellet or bullet, may be out of sight, lying hidden in the flesh. The place
thereof if you shall handle, you shall find eminent, rough and uneven. The
division does not tend directly forward, but shows greater, and wider. The
flesh shows blackish, bruised, and there is pain with certain heaviness.
The wounds that are empoysoned you shall perceive, in that the flesh will
show pale, of a bloe color, and be deaddish, etc.

Prog.
Wounds in the fleshie parts are easily cured, but those of the nerves,
veins, and arteries, do not unite again, neither are without danger. The
bones do join again by their natural glewe. Wounds in the Of these, some
are necessarily mortal: as wounds in the heart, midr^ife, stomache, guts,
and bladder: Some, but for the most part, as those of the brain: (^f we
credit Arcaeus, lib. de vul. and Coiter in his observations.) The rest, as in
the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, and Wesande, most often healed, if they be
artificially dealt withal, as witness many men's observations, together with
our experience. Very dangerous also, are ouerthwhart wounds in the Muscles,
and such as are inflicted, when the member is extended.

Paracelsus observes a matter more secret, Chir. m^. li. i. c. xvi.
where he says: When Choler ^ath betaken it self to the arteries, ca^sing
the parts to tremble, and move unorderly: if at the same time, those parts be
hurt, death ensues, which I understand to be, by reason of the extreme
ebullition, and pro^use expense of the spirits, which by no means, can at
that time be restrained: for therefore he says afterward, that in the same
danger is every wound, made in any ebullition. That then we need not
marvel, though of a small wound the party sometimes dye, without any
manifest cause. And the uncertain success of wounds, both by reason hereof:
as also of sex, temperature and lurking accidents, causes the same author
otherwhere esteem it f^te^, Chir. mag. ^r. i. c. v.
to reckon all wounds (that is to say, of all parts) in the Catalogue of
deadly, rather then account any of them safe, and void of danger.


isntrumental parts, as in the brain, heart, lunges, liver, spleen, midreife,
wesand, stomach, guts, and bladdar, are deadly. A fever, sounding,
perturbation, alienation of the mind, crampe, etc. coming upon a wound, are
perilous. There be iij. terminations to wounds. The first and shortest is
within seuen^ days. The longest xl. days. And the middlemost (according to
the nature and order of sharp diseases) xiiij. days. If the wound appear
suspicious and enwrapped with doubtful indications, prognosticate nothing
until the seventh day.

To the direction of the cure, Cure.
of wounds in general, pertain iiij. intentions. First intention of the cure.
The first must be in regard of the cause, the second of the disease or
wound it self, the third respecting the part affected: and the iiii. the
symptoms o^ accidents concurring. The cause, to wit, the outward things
wherewith the wound was inflicted, must (if they stick yet in the same) by
all means, be sought to be removed. Which purpose to atchiue, you have two
notable ways to work, that is to wit, by instruments, and by medicines: by
instruments, in this sort: if it be a long and slender dart, consider, whether
the head of it be even and smooth, or else uneven and bearded, if it be even,
it is to be drawn forth, either on the contrary side, or the same way it
went in. You are to choose the contrary side, if so be there be likelihoode
of doing more hurt, by tearing the parts, in drawing it backwards, then in
t^king it out contrary way. The way therefore being opened sunder the flesh
with an instrument made after the similitude of this greek letter (...) now
when the dart head apeareth, and shows it self, into the place of your
incision, if the steal or shaft be yet in the head, it will help you the
better, to thrust it thorough, to the other side, that so, you may there draw
it forth. But if only the head stick within, then must you make shift,
either with your fingers, or some convenient instrument to take hold of it,
and so draw it forth. If you see it more convenient, to draw it back again,
the way that it went in, that must you also attempt by the like reason: to wit,
the wound being enlarged, draw it out by the steal, if it have any, if it
have none, draw forth the iron either with the opening cane, or the crow
bill, or the darte drawer, or other like devised instrument for the purpose:
enlarging sufficiently the wound, if otherwise, it be to narrow for the
instrument. Now if the head be spiked or bearded, if the beardes be small,
break them off first, and then draw out the dart: but if the beardes be
large, conuaye quilles in that order betwixt them and the flesh, that the flesh
may not be torn in their going out: but if the head be bearded both forwards
and backwardes, so that it can come out neither way, then must you needs open
the place with a new incision (without you know of a vein or such other
vessel of danger, in that place, that forbids it) and so sufficient room
being p^ocured, take forth the head gently and without plucking. Some do
likewise bridle those beardes, with quilles, or pieces of reeds, that they may
not tear, and so pluck them out that way that seems readiest. Broad darts
or spear heads being hidden in the flesh, it is not expedient to thrust them
out on the other side, for fear of making one great wound upon another, they are
therefore to be pulled out with Diocles darte drawer. An instrument devised by
Diocles, and called of the Greeks Eraphiscum. If a bullet of lead or iron, be
lodged in the wound, first place the parties body in the same gesture (if it
may be) in which it was when it received the wound: and so search with a
probe, which way the pellet is gone, (this observe in the drawing out of all
artillery) if the case be such as the patient may not have his body placed in
that order, yet at least, so place him, lyinge, that, as much as may be, he
may come near to the fashion. This done, enlarge the wound, and take out the
pellet by the way that it entered, with some hook, probe, crowebill, or
scissourlike mullet, or such other, as the wound is easliest able to receive
for that operation. If so be, the shot be in such sort hidden, as that it
may in no wise be found, or else may not safely enough be drawn forth, then
is it to be let alone, till nature either thrust it forth, or manifest it. And
it has been seen sometime, that without offense of nature, a bullet has
tarried within, for a certain space, after the wound was cloosed up and
healed. And again, after a certain space, to come forth by way of
apostemation: after which the wound has been perfectly healed, the same cure
being used thereto, as to other wounds. To speak generally of al sorts of
engines inflicting wounds, if they stick in but superficially, and have not
persed or broken any great veins, then are they to be drawn out, the same
way they went in. As also it falls out sometime, even in those that lie
deep: to wit, when manifest danger, either through loss of blood, or consent
of some principal parts, is forespyed likely to fall out, through the
opening of the contrary side. In such a case therefore, we either draw it
forth with our fingers, or by the steal of the shaft, or dart, (if it have
any) or otherwise, by conuaying a steal into the hollow of the iron, and so
wind it forth. But there is another case, wherein if it lie deep, it is not
to be plucked out the same way, but, but, on the contrary side, as when the
way is longer for it to come back again then to be thrust through outright,
and has already in going in, pearsed through veins and synewes: briefly,
when but a little whole flesh remains to be pearsed through, and that nothing
lets, whereby incision might not be fitly made, on the other side against
the point of it, in such a case, it is better to open that that remains, and
thrust out the dart, on the other side. for so, it is both nearer hand to
find, and safelier taken out, as also in a great member, if the point have
once passed the midst of it, it heals easilyer, if the way be made quit
thorough, because it may receive the help of medicines on both ^ides. Now it
must be thrust through, either by the steal, if it stick in, or else (if the
steal be shaked out of the head) with a propulsorie instrument^ either
hollowe^ or solid, (which some call the deaf propulsorie) even as the case
requi^eth. Further note, that if it have a sharp point (which you shall find
by searching with your probe) then you must use the female propulsorie
instrument, but if it have a hollow or socket, the male propulsorie: and so by
such means, thrust it on forward, till you may easily take hold of it to
pluck it forth. Always having notable regard, that you divide not a nerve or
a tendon, either some great vein or artery. As for those that stick in the
bone, it is not safe to pluck them out otherwise, then back again: shaking
or moving the darte, till the place be loosed, wherein it was holden, and
then with the hand, or instrument, draw it forth: which manner of dealing
likewise is used in plucking forth of teeth, and very seeldome does the
dart, not follow, if it be so used: but if it do chance to stay, it may be
stricken out with some instrument. Some bind the bow called Balista, to some
of the mullet like instruments or pinsers, and so, the patient sitting fast in
his place, by drawing and loosing again the string of the same instrument,
draw forth the darte: but if the darte stick ^eeper in the bone, (which we
know by that, that it will by no force be moved) then with a chissell^
cutting away the bone near about it, or else pearsing it through (if it be
thick) with a ^erebrer, we take forth the dart. There are, which from the
hole of the terebrer, do cut out the bone against the dart, after the
fashion of the letter (...) so that the lines, which are sundred may respect
the darte: which done, it must necessarily slip, and be easily taken out.
which is the last remedy.

Othersome, with a straight long ^erebrer, called the direct Terebrer, do
strain open the rift of the bone, wherein the darte is holden, that whilst
the same gapeth, the darte may be drawn away. In things fixed in a joint,
that is, betwixt two bones, you are to fasten to both sides of the joint,
strong rowles or bands, and the one of them pulling one way, the other another
way, draw open the joint, that the tendons, ligamentes, and nerves may
stretch: which being so extended, ^he space in the joint betwixt the two bones
must needs be easier, so that without any difficulty, the thing infixed may
be taken foo^th. But in this business it must also be looked to, that no
nerve, vein, or artery be hurt, whilst the infixed thing is drawn out. Thus
much touching drawing out darts (and other artillery, or things infixed,)
by mettalline instruments, and manual operation. Now let us see what may be
done by medicines.

To the drawing out therefore of little bones, thorns, heeres, stones, pieces
of glass, etc. these simples are of force and available: to wit, dictamnum,
thapsia, sagapenum, ammoniacum, radices aristolochiae, ranae combustae, radix
arundinis, propolis, viscum, opopo^ax, C^lx viua, faex vini vsta, lepidium,
sinapi, ranunculus, adeps vrsinus, etc. fermentum, etc. Compound medicines you
may thus prepare, to wit, a plaster ex radice arundinis and melle. or, cum
farina lolij, radice arundinis, and melle..
or this: Recipe lapid. magnetis.j. rad. aristolochiae v^riusque ana,.j.
polypodij, visci ana,.j. sterc. anseris,.j. ss. amoni aci, galbani in vino
dissolut. ana,.ss. propoleos.ij. ol. lilior^^..iij. mellis.j. fiat Emplastrum.
A liniment for that purpose you may make ex puluere magnetis mixed with some
mundifying matter, and therewith arm the tent and apply it, in such sort
notwithstanding, as that the tente may not reach to, to touch the iron.

Second ^ntention in the cure
When you have thus far provided, that nothing unnatural be left remaining in
the wound, then follows your next care, to cure and join again the parts
that were so seuered^ If therefore the solution be small, it is to be restored
by the winding manner of rolling, for so out of doubt, the wound shall join
and heal, without the use of any other outward cure: specially if it be a
simple wound, and encombred with no other affect or symptom. But if the
solution be great, it must be helped, by artificial closing together the
gaping sides and borders of the wound, to wit, either by seame ^aches,
verucles, or stitching clothes. The seame is made with a strong^, equal and
smooth threede, ^eame, or ^laine ^^itch.
as a silken threede, at the least in common wounds, taking the first stitche
in the midst of the division, the next between that and the one end of the
wound, and so forth proceeding, that there may be convenient distance between
every two stitches, till the ^ides of the wound be committed together. So that
neither must the stitches be set too thick nor thin For if they stand too
thin, they cannot hold: if too thick, they make too much pain. Because
that, the ofter the flesh is pearsed of the needle, and the more places the
threede twitcheth, by so much the greater inflammations do rise. So also let
your seame join together the borders of the wound, that yet the sides meet
not close together, to the end there may be way and space to purge out, what
matte^ gathers together within the wound. They are wont therefore to leave
the breadth of a finger commonly between every stitch. Moreover, see that your
needle be long, smooth, and threesquare pointed, with a guttered eye, that the
threede, close couching therein, may give no occasion of stickinge in the
passing through of the needle. Besides, you must have a stitchinge quill,
whereupon the lip of the wound may lean, and stay it self stedily without
slipping hither and thither whilst the needle is pearsing it thorough, and so,
that through the little window or loope hole of it, you may spy when the
needle has pearsed through, that then you may draw it on end, with the
threede. All the while that the threede is drawinge through, underprop the
lip of the wound, with your probe, that it tugg not outward in following the
same. Let it be tied first with ij. inuolutio^s or bowtes, the second time with
one only, and so cut of the thread, somewhat distant from the knott. Thus when
the parts are drawn together by stitching, use glutinatiue medicines, which
may both consume and dry up, the corruption of humors gathered, as also
prohibit lest any more come thither. The second way of ioyninge is by claspes,
Claspes, or tack^ookes.
and these must you make greater or lesser, according to the quality of the
wounded part. But let them be from each side crooking back, fastening one
hook in the one lip of the wound, and drawing it toward the other lip,
fastening therein the other hook, as they use to do, that dress clothes
upon the Tenters. These claspes whereby we draw together the borders of
gaping wounds, require no force or strayning, but only are so far
profitable, as the skin seems willinge, of it own accord, to follow that
which leads or draws it.

The third way, Verncle, or the quil^ stitch.
to restore the severed sides, is by verucles, even made, of stupes strongly
writhen, and slender like a writing quill or reed, and the length almost of
the middle finger. But if we covet to have the stitching hold a long time,
take a writing quill, in steed of the stupes, and do as follows. Draw a
stitche through both sides of the wound, and return your needle through
again by the same way it came, so that you leave your threede in a loope, on
that side, whence the needle returned, in which loope, put one of the quilles,
then take both the ends of your threede, to wit, both the beginning, and that
that came back again, and strain or urge them so, as the sides of the wound
may draw togitherwarde, and putting between them the other quill, tie them on
a knott, and cut away the remnant of threede, so leave it to the perfect
healinge of the wound. The fourth stitchinge, The dry stitch.
is performed by clothes, applied on both sides the wound, in form
triangled, and of such greatness, as seems best agreeable to the member that
is hurt. Which kind of stitche is most agreeable to such places, as we covet
to heal, most without blemish or skarre as in the face. Those clothes must be
fastened on with some viscous or hard clea^ing liniment, compounded of sanguis
draconis, thus, mastiches, pix. and pollen, that is, farina volatilis. all
which must be encorporated with albumen oui, and so made one. And then spread
upon one side of your clothes, which clothes then must you lay on each side
the wound, a thumb breadth distant from the same. Thus when that ointment
drying, the clothes become fastened in their place, make in them your
stitching, ingeniously to the purpose. by which means, the lips of the
wound shall go together and glewe again.

Now when you have wrought for the drawing together of the wound, you must
after also carefully see to it, to preserve so, and keep together the parts
that you have joined: which is also done commonly by the continuance of the
same means. That is to wit, decent bynding, apt placinge of the member, and
stitching, if it shall be thought necessary.

The third scope, The 3. intention in the cure.
now is, to preserve the substance of the wounded part and prohibit, lest it
come to be troubled with pain, inflammation, or other untoward accident.
Inflammation is restrained by taking away the cause of his fluxion. And humors
flow to a place, either in that they are sent, or in that they are drawn.
They are drawn first through pain, and then through heat of the member. But
when they are sent, it is, as it were into a weak part, as when the whole
body is abundant with good or evil juice. Therefore to hinder and take away
the cause of the fluxion. three things are to be attended unto: the first is
pain, which must be In this place, handling that scope of the cure, that
respects the part affected, the Author was onely^ to have delivered all the
means, both by diet and medicines, that were to preserve the bodi^ and parts
in a prosperous state of healing, and after that, to have looked unto such a
condition, a^ is now combred with accidents, (which is his fourth intention)
that the reader may see, here is no plac^ for medicines against pain, (which
is not yet supposed to be) and that besides this inuerting of his own order,
there is also omitted that should justly have occupied the rowme thereof: to
wit, the local medicines for the cure of the wound: which ^e has very ill
deferred to the Chapter ^f a simple wound that the reader should not be
perplexed, I am driven thus to note the author, whom otherwise I could gladly
have spared, as in many other places of ^is order.
mitigated and the heat quenched, either with some plaster ex radice solani
triti and axungia porci, or, ex folijs maluae coctis, tritis, and furfure and
rosaceo: else, ex medulla panis triticei, in aqua feruenti macerata: or, with
oleum rosac. etc. or, oui albumen, cum vino stiptico. The second is a full good
liking and high state of body, which must be diminished partly by diet,
partly by bloudletting: which first must be do^ far of, and then even in the
wounded part itself: at such a quantity, as is convenient and meet, both in
regard of the store, that is in the body, and of the measure that came out of
the wound, as also of the time, age, nature, and custom of the body. The
diet must tend to cooling. Use therefore light frication of the contrary
parts, much rest. for meat, the flesh of partriche, chickens, hens, and
little birds, barley, ptisan. For pothe^^es, lettuse, purcelane, borrage, etc.
For drink, either Small beer or ale, with us, which also (if time and place do

Keep the diet thus skant and straited for the first 7. days. Then after, when
you see the patient free from inflammation and abscesse, let loose also to a
fuller diet. The third thing to look to, is, a state of body pestered with
evil juice, which, if it be yellowe choler, purge with cas^ia, manna,
rhabarb, tamarindis, etc. If it be phlegm, with agaric. sem. carthami,
diaphaenicon etc. If it be melancholy, diasenna, diaprunes lenitiue, sena,
polypodium, etc. To these means, of keeping the body in a good disposition of
healing, must be joined (as I touched before) the ad^ised use of local
medicines: be they balmes, plasters, powders, vnguenies, or what fourmes
soever. Which, because the aucthor has here omitted, I must request the
Reader, to turn to the Chapter of a simple wound, where all these things are
largely delivered.

of removing things superfluous, and of a disagreeable nature. Secondly, of
joining the wound again: thirdly, of keeping the good estate of the part.

Simples, mitigating pain, are, Pain.
First of all, wisely consider, what is the occasion of the pain: for if there
be n^ distemperature first, suspect some error to be, either in your
medicenes or bynding.

Of the inflammation we have entreated before. The distemperature is to be
regarded, as it is, either hot or cold: if it be hot: Hot intemperature.
consider whether the same be general in the whole body, or only in the part
affected. If it be a distemperature of the whole, as a fever: it must be cured
so as a fever. If only in the part (which will appear by the redness) then
it must be abated with cooling things, as roses, planten, vnguentum album,
This is most excellent of Paracelsus: Rec. rad. hyosciami, q.s. digerantur in
aceto rosaceo as solemn, fiat Epithema: In this wet clothes, and apply warm to
the payned place. Lolium and Papauer may be used in steed thereof. And this
wonderfully swageth pain.
etc. Cold in^ temperature.
Cold distemperature (which is spied by the sauftnes and swart color of the
part) is cured by heating medicines: as with wine, or vnguentum fuscum,
vnguentum basiliconis etc. A conuulsion Conuulsion.
must be dealt with, acording the causes whereof it comes and is effected: as
if it be of repletion, and that of phlegm, set order that the air of the place
be tending to hot and dry. Let mean sleep be procured, by night, not by
day. Seek quietness and rest^ for the parts conuulsed are specially to be
holden in rest, and kept from inordinat motions. Use frication to the vertebres
of the neck: keep the belly soluble, and a calm mind^ free from the tempests
of perturbatio^s. Let his diet be barley cream, rere eggs, roasted flesh of
capons, chickens, hens, etc. herbs: sage, maioram, hissop, mother time.
Fruits: raisons, pine kernels, sweet almondes. His drink, sweetened water,
wherein has boild a little sage and cinnamon: but let him abstain from wine,
specially in the beginning throughout all his diet, let him be spare in the
quantity, chiefly the first three days, afterward, taking some more
liberty. If you see the flegmatike humor is not altogether severed from the
blood, and nothing else let, begin first with opening the middle vain, emptying
it not much at one time, but doing it at diverse times. If there be place for
purging, you may perform it with such a pill: Rec. pil. faetidarum, pil. de
sagapeno, ana,.j. ss. agaricitrochis^..ss. misce and cum syrupo betonicae fiant
pillulae. Apply to the part conuulsed oleu^ de casto^^o, laurinu^, nardinu^,
costinu^, nucis moscatae, or such other, or a catapl. ex faenugr. sem. lini,
farina hord. oleo rutaceo etc. If the co^uulsion com of repletion of blood, or
inflammation, then let blood the middle vein, not much quantity at once, but
at many times. Then use sharp clifters, observing that there be no necessary
circumstance withstanding either course. if the inflammation persist, use
medicines such as the inflamatio^ requires, and acording to the diverse times of
it, taking your indicatio^ from the part affected. If the cause of the
conuulsion be emptines, direct his diet to moistnes: as, moist air, sleep
longer then wont, rest of body and mind, free from affections. His meat such
as aforesaid, changing his herbs and fruts to letuse, arage, spinach, borage,
mallows, etc. milons, gourdes, damask prunes, peaches, ripe grapes, etc. Add
also little stone fishes. His drink thin watered wine, barley water, or water
sodden with liquorise and Cinnamon. keeping such a moderate compass, for the
quantity, as is answerable to the bodies strength, age, time, etc. Give him

two manner of ways: one is, by pricking or half cutting of some synewe, and
then it follows immediately, the other is brought in by pain and
inflammation, his forerunners, and this after a longer time. The first I will
touch no further in this place, because I am drawn to it again, by Wecker, in
the Chapter of wounds in the sinews. The second sort must be taken away,
by remoouing the causes: and that, beginning with the first, and proceeding in
order, to the last, even as one evil here brought forth another: to wit,
offense of the nerve pain, pain inflammation, inflammation putrefaction,
putrefaction malign vapors, which proceeding from part to part, by the
continuitie of nerves, are at last communicated to the brain it self, whence
proceeds conuulsion. Now the offense of the nerve, which causes this kind
of conuulsion, I understand to be, some cold air, or vnmeet^ medicine
applied: the medicine being either of venomous quality, or else of unjust
temperature. Of venomous or malign quality, are most sorts of corrosiues.
Unjustly tempered are, all barbours digestiues, most distilled balmes simply,
and at first applied, and other too hot, opening and relaxing, together with
such mundifying and attractiue medicines, as want aequiualent mixture of
dryness and astringe^cie. Having therefore taken awa^e, that which offended
both in your air and medicines, and provided by better ones, that nature in
the wound may find rest and friendly nourishment, you shall afterward, with
no great difficulty, by the mean^s here se^ down, take away both
inflammation and conuulsion. Any other way you loose your labor.


Sounding.
Sownding, if it be of pain, by all means endeavor to appease the pain. If it
come by unmeasurable euacuation, sprinkle rose water, or cold water in his
face: bind strongly the extreme parts of the body, and chafe them with
clothes indifferent rough. If of vicious air, change the same to a better
temperature. If of venomous quality, or stroke of a venomous creture, then
with medicines fit for For this matter, read more in the fourth Chapter
following.
poison must he be cured.

Rauing.
The seventh symptom is rauing, or frantiknes: appoint therefore a diet mean
twixt heat and cold: give rest, provoke sleep, loosnes of belly, and
quietness of mind, using gentle frications. His meat let be Barley cream,
herbs, lettuse, suckerie, mallows, and such as cool and moisten. Skalie
stone fishes toward the declination, Pomegranet, tart aples, cheries etc. his
drink Barley water, or the decoction of Cinnamon, with syrup of violets, roses,
or water Lillies. If the body abound with blood, and nothing else hinder, open
a vain in the cubite. Then alter the humor with convenient syrupes, as sir.
violaceus, rosaceus, ex nymphea. sir. endiuiae, de papauere. And if you see
good further to empty the body, do it with manna, cassia, saccharum
violaceum: or, syrup. ex pluribus infusionibus vi^larum vel rosarum: else, a
clister ex decocto maluaru^, violaru^, hordei, capi^um papaueris, ac folior^m
betae, and pauco sole, adding to.iij. ol. violacei, cas^iae j. and so make a
clister. He may also use to abate the hot distemperature (if need be)
conserve of roses, violets, or water lillies, loch. de papauere, and such like:
applying outwardly, to the head oxyrhodinu^, in Summer, but warm, in winter
moderatly hot, or an embrocation ex rosis. violis, hyosciamo, lactuca,

for the head would be made ex rosaceo, in quo decoctu^ fuerit thymu^,
serpyllu^, melilot. althea, anethu^, flores chamomillae Always be it observed
(as I have noted before) that, if this accident be caused of pain, and
distemperature in the wound, you first, by all means, practice to remove the
same. And therefore to prevent all such evils, once for all, I will admonish,
that for the first seven days, you be very circumspect, and (as it were)
jealous over the wound, for pain: and for tha^ ^ause, sundry times (if need
be) uncover the member, and foment, the circumstant parts of the wound cum
aceto and oleo rosaceo, or (if more need) cum aceto ex rad. hyosciami, noted
before.
etc.

Palsy.
For the palsy, the last symptom, be no less circumspect both by diet and
medicines. Make the air hot and dry, mean sleep, but no day sleep.
Moderate exercise, which is good, if it may be used. Frication with old oil,
or oil of rewe, a pleasant mind free from perturbations. His meat ba^ley
cream, rere eggs, broth of hen, made with a little hyssope, sage, maiorame,
betonie, or sauorie. Also roasted chicken, capon, hen, etc. his drink, honyed
water, sod with some cinnamon or sage else this Ipocras: Rs. cinnamomi,.ij.

If you find the humor through mingled with the blood, by and by in the
beginning open a vain, if al circumstances be thereto agreeable: but do it in
the sounder parts and that moderately, that the body be not to much cooled. If
the humor be crude and unfit to purge, first alter, concoct, sunder and make
thin the same with this or such a syrup: Rec. sir. de staechade, sir. de
hyssopo an..ss. mellis rosac. aquaru^ maioranae, betonicae, rorismarini, an..j.

By these two, (in the case of wounds) Paracelsus has this meaning: when a
wound toward the latter end, swells with heat, looks bluish, or
swarte, and afterward black, and last of al, the member enflameth, this he
calls Ignis Persicus. Cancer, is when wounds conceive heat, and therewith
flu^e of humors, which make frettings and vlcerations about them. Moreover at
the shutting up of a wound, if it be done too soudainly, without firm
foundation, so as it afterward putrify and break forth again, This he
calls the Pu^iulous fistul^: ^^^tulous ^ule.
and for remedy appoints this: Recipe liquoris carabis, Aspal^i, armoniaci,

After, work it vp^ cum oleo Chamomillae. He handles besides these, other
accidents, but I cannot communicate them to the Reader, for the difficulty of
the medicines.

ANNOTATIONS.
a Of these, some are necessarily mortal: as wounds in the heart, midr^ife,
stomache, guts, and bladder: Some, but for the most part, as those of the
brain: (^f we credit Arcaeus, lib. de vul. and Coiter in his observations.)
The rest, as in the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, and Wesande, most often healed, if
they be artificially dealt withal, as witness many men's observations,
together with our experience. Very dangerous also, are ouerthwhart wounds in
the Muscles, and such as are inflicted, when the member is extended.

Paracelsus observes a matter more secret, Chir. m^. li. i. c. xvi.
where he says: When Choler ^ath betaken it self to the arteries, ca^sing
the parts to tremble, and move unorderly: if at the same time, those parts be
hurt, death ensues, which I understand to be, by reason of the extreme
ebullition, and pro^use expense of the spirits, which by no means, can at
that time be restrained: for therefore he says afterward, that in the same
danger is every wound, made in any ebullition. That then we need not
marvel, though of a small wound the party sometimes dye, without any
manifest cause. And the uncertain success of wounds, both by reason hereof:
as also of sex, temperature and lurking accidents, causes the same author
otherwhere esteem it f^te^, Chir. mag. ^r. i. c. v.
to reckon all wounds (that is to say, of all parts) in the Catalogue of
deadly, rather then account any of them safe, and void of danger.

b It is possible sometime, to abridge this term, even to three days, or
less.

d Hooks to tacke the sides together: but what unprofitable business, of
stitching and hooking, is here taught from antiquity, many can testify at
this day: who having long ago reiec^ed such disagreable courses, and
conten^ed themselves ordinarily with fit medici^es, and seemly rolling,
seeldome or never found cause to think upon these neanes, Chir. mag. tr. i.

all things succeedinge much better, without them: and certainly, Paracelsus
does in some part worthily condemn them. As for hooks and verrucles, they
are worn ou^ of use with the multitude: that it greeueth me, to see men, in
writing their books, to regard rather, what is written, then what is meet
to be written. Neither would I here be understood, utterly to gain say
all use, and kinds of stitching: but only the hooks and verrucles simply:
the plain sticthe, but for the most part: ^or there be rare cases (as to
stay in the guts, hold on a joint, etc.) Wherein, when the Artist cannot
avoid it, this may be used: according to the old Maxim: In a hard case, a
hard remedy is better then none. As for that kind of stitch, called The dry
stitch, I have in no wise, said against it.

e In this place, handling that scope of the cure, that respects the part
affected, the Author was onely^ to have delivered all the means, both by diet
and medicines, that were to preserve the bodi^ and parts in a prosperous state
of healing, and after that, to have looked unto such a condition, a^ is now
combred with accidents, (which is his fourth intention) that the reader may
see, here is no plac^ for medicines against pain, (which is not yet supposed
to be) and that besides this inuerting of his own order, there is also omitted
that should justly have occupied the rowme thereof: to wit, the local medicines
for the cure of the wound: which ^e has very ill deferred to the Chapter ^f a
simple wound that the reader should not be perplexed, I am driven thus to note
the author, whom otherwise I could gladly have spared, as in many other
places of ^is order.

fSmall beer or ale, with us, which also (if time and place do serve) may be
ton^ed up with vulnerarie herbs, as sani^ula^ ophioglossum, Alchimilla,
consolida, agrimonia, betonica, vinca peruinca, aristolochia. etc.

g To these means, of keeping the body in a good disposition of healing, must
be joined (as I touched before) the ad^ised use of local medicines: be they
balmes, plasters, powders, vnguenies, or what fourmes soever. Which, because
the aucthor has here omitted, I must request the Reader, to turn to the
Chapter of a simple wound, where all these things are largely delivered.

h Among the medicines to staunche blood, may be numbered, crocus martis, crocus
veneris, cinis ranarum, and a ^oade artificially dried, lapt in a clothe, and
laid near the wound. Also the blood stone holden in the patientes hand, or
hung about his neck.

i First of all, wisely consider, what is the occasion of the pain: for if
there be n^ distemperature first, suspect some error to be, either in your
medicenes or bynding.

k This is most excellent of Paracelsus: Rec. rad. hyosciami, q.s. digerantur

to the payned place. Lolium and Papauer may be used in steed thereof. And this
wonderfully swageth pain.

l Conuulsion happens to wounds no^ done by venomous creatures, two manner of
ways: one is, by pricking or half cutting of some synewe, and then it
follows immediately, the other is brought in by pain and inflammation, his
forerunners, and this after a longer time. The first I will touch no further in
this place, because I am drawn to it again, by Wecker, in the Chapter of

parts of the wound cum aceto and oleo rosaceo, or (if more need) cum aceto

CHAP. II. Of a contused wound.
WHether the wound were given by a fall, Causes and ^ignes.
or stroke of staff, stone, or such other, you shall best understand by
inquiry. But that it is a contused wound, it will appear by swelling, pain,
blackish or blue color, etc.

Cure.
And because the ordinary entrance into the cure of this wound, is many times,
intercepted by the importunity of accidents, let us It is not of necessity,
that by and by, in a contused wound, there be found these accidents, neither
that the whole scope of the cure, should ever first, be bent against them, but
rather (as in other cases) minister such fit helps unto the wound, as may
also have respect unto the accidents: neither do I think, that Wecker means
any other thing in this place: howebei^, (in my judgment) his method had been

first labor to repress them, and afterward proceed to the cure of the
wound it self. The accidents be either pain or swelling: pain must be
mitigated with oleum an^thinum, ol. chamomelini^s, ol. liliorum, or a liniment
ex ol. rosaceo, and vitello oui, laid upon lynt and applied, the tumor that
you find, is to be removed, by the taking away, both of the antecedent and
conioynd cause: and the antecedent cause, being the humor flowing, the conioynd
cause, the humor already contained in the wounded part, to the cutting off of
both these we must labor with all our might: first for the defluxion, it is to
be considered, whether it be of blood, or other humors, if it be blood, it is
to be euacuated, either from the point whence it flows, or else from the
place whether it flows. The rage of the fluxion, coming either from the
whole body or part thereof, is to be bridled by bloudletting^ or thin
cooling diet. From the part whether it goes, there are two ways to dispatch
it: one is by reuulsion, in withdrawing the humor to a contrary part, either
with phlebotomie, cupping, frication, or ligatures on the contrary side: the
other way is by repercussiues, when the matter is not drawn but sent, as with
ol. rosaceum, ol. mirtinum, or an unguent ex bolo armeno, cleo and aceto,
wherewith the circu^stant parts about the wound are to be anointed, else a
plaster ex puluere mirtillorum and oui candido. If the defluxion come not of
blood, but of other humors, then must it be taken away with purging medicines
according to the nature of those humors. which point is now set down before in
the curation of tumors beyond nature. The humor now impact in the part is to
be brought to That is to say, if it cannot be resolved.

digestive for the wound it self is to be made ex ^erebynthina, resina, and
ouoru^ luteis. The accidents thus provided for, and put away, go on to the cure
of the wound, considering thereof as the present s^ate requires, to wit,
whether it be filthy, hollow, plain, or torn. If therefore it be foul or
filthy, mundifie it with mel rosar. or a mundificatiue ex apio, or vnguentu^

up the member in such sort, as may aptly keep the medicines in their place:
thus doing till the wound be perfectly purged: the holownes of the wound must
be filled with incarnatiue medicines such as, thus, aristologia, aloe, fuligo
thuris, mirrha, pix liquida, resina, colophonia, chrysocolla, christallus. etc.
whereof you may thus provide you unguents, as ex aloe, cera, and aerugine, or

otherwise, ex oleo, cera, aerugine, terebynthina, thure, manna, etc. again if
the wound be once made plain and even, it must be sealed up with cicatrizing
medicines: as are malicoriu^, galla, myrthus, aerugo lota, scoria plumb^
cerusa, pompholix, plumbu^ vstu^, bolus armenus and such like. among which you
may fit your self on this wise: as making an vngue^t ex pompholyge, chalce

be so torn, that you see in the beginning, it is necessary to use some
stitching, let it be done, yet slackly, so as it is enough if you shall only
retain or stay the lips of the wound.

ANNOTATIONS.
a It is not of necessity, that by and by, in a contused wound, there be found
these accidents, neither that the whole scope of the cure, should ever first,
be bent against them, but rather (as in other cases) minister such fit helps
unto the wound, as may also have respect unto the accidents: neither do I
think, that Wecker means any other thing in this place: howebei^, (in my
judgment) his method had been more apt, if after his general regiment,
coming to his local administrations, he had taught, first the cure of the
wound, and after remembered the accidents.

CHAP. IIII. Of a wound done by biting, or stinging of creatures, either
venomous, or otherwise.
Whether the creature that inflicted the wound, Causes and signs.
was venomous, as a mad dog, a serpent, scorpion, basiliske, dragon, viper,
shrew, spider, etc. or else not venomous: such as a domestical dog, ape,
man, horse, sow, catte, waspe^ be, etc. the patient is commonly able to
deliver unto you, notwithstanding these signs do argue a venomous biting: to
wit, pain, pricking, vehement biting grief, change of color, the patient
vexed with grievous anguishes, all burning with heat, and sometime the body
grows astonished, his pain sometime slacketh, sometime renueth, now heat,
now cold, etc. If the biting be not venomous, the accidents are lesser.

A venomous biting is most perilous, Prog.
especially if it be of continuance, because poison does always, naturally seek
the destruction of the heart, whence it is, that if the patient be
hydrophobus, (that is, though thirsty, yet fearful of all water,) he is
incurable.

Cure.
For the cure of this kind of wound, we will consi^e^ of it (as before in
setting down the signs) two ways, that is, as it is, either venomous, or not
venomous If it be found venomous, we have three general intentions to
provide a remedy for it. the first of them, is respecting the cause of the
disease, the second stands in regard of the part affected: the third
considers of the disease it self. The cause therefore, being venom, shows
it self the first captain enemy to be dealt against. with whom to couple,
we have three sorts of chosen weapons: manual operation, diet and medicines.
Manual operation is performed by cupping, sucking with the mouth, cauterie or
cutting. The cupping must be done with much flame, and applied to the very
wound, the parts round about being first scarified, whereby the more vicious
blood may be drawn out. Mouthsucking is thought convenient, if the disease, be
but light: or in steed of it, the tail of a hen applied to the wound. A
ca^terie is to be used, so the place be not full of synewes. And cutting is
approved, if the venom be of a malig^e nature, and abundauntly impressed.
The diet for this, is set down in the cure of the carbuncle. Now the
medicines against this venom, must be I cannot here, in silence ouerslippe,
the undoubted cure of a mad dogs biting, which Julius Palmarius reports.

of need) take a like quantity, powder them, and give.ss. either in a spoone,
with double sugar: or else in drink, brothe, butter, or honey, every day, for
three or four days, or mo^, if it be long after the biting, or the patient
become now fearful of water. For this does not only prevent, but also cure
that grievous and fearful accident, if more then three fittes of it have not
passed, before this cure begin. Except the wound^ be given in the parts of
the head above the t^ethe, or else the wounded part immediately after the
by^ing, b^ washed wi^h cold water. In the mean time, the wounded part must be

the affected part, it is to be noted, that the same is to be done two manner
of ways: as it is first, and by it self, or as it is secondly affected. For
the part that first, and by it self is affected, it is sometime expedient to
cut off, chiefly when it is such one, as may not unfitly admit such
handling, as the extreme parts: as also when the wound is known to have
such a conditioned venom, as brings unavoidable danger, such as are all
serpents, to wit, the aspe, the horned serpent Cerastes, the viper, etc. Now
the part that comes by his hurt at the second hand, is the heart: which
therefore we must confirm, and keep safe from the venom, by all means of
inward and outward medicines. a potion: Recipe theriacae.j. ss. vini

fasting..iij. the second or third day after his biting. Outward helps are
likewise to be provided applyable to the nastrels, as nigella, as also to the
heart, as epithemes which you shall find in the cure of the carbuncle. the
third intention minds the disease it self, to wit, the wound as it i^
unripe, filthy, hollow or plain, while it is unripe, it is to be wrought upon
with ripeners or suppuratiues, as vng. basilicon, vng. fuscum cum galbano, etc.
the other iij. require mundificatiues, incarnatiues, and cicatrizing medicines
as shall be said hereafter.

We have hitherto spoken of this kind of wound, as it is venomous, now as
it is not venomous. To the cure whereof, we will also use three intentions, to
wit respecting the cause the symptoms, and wound it self. The cause of the
disease, being matter not venomous, is to be taken away by medicines more
gently drawing, such as is oleum sambucinum applied hot, the symptom is
pain, which is to be mitigated, with this liniment, Rec. oui candidi, butyri,

CHAP. V. Of a simple wound in the flesh.
Def.
A Simple wound is that which consists alone, that is, which is without loss
of any substance, or any other affect, or symptom joined with it.

The cause, whether it came of sword dart, Causes and signs.
or such like^ the patient can best declare, and whether it be great or li^le,
by sight you may discern.

Cure.
Addressing you to the cure, first, remove al outward causes, which may hinder
the joining (as here is or oil, etc.) which first must be removed. The second
purpose is to join together the breach that is made, whether it be great or
little: as, if it be but small, join together the sides of the wound by a
decent ligature, to wit, a roll with two beginninges, and so those wounds
whose sides are not far asunder, shall if they be exactly closed again, only
by natures work, without al other outward business, heal and grow together
again. But if the division be great, it requires further cure^ as, first to
be closed, by buttons, either else by stitching, with an even silk thread,
taking your first stitch in the midst of the division, and the next two in
the middle spaces, betwixt that midst, and either end of the wound, and so
forward proceeding, as that betwixt every two stitches, there may space for one
remain, until you have taken so many, as thereby the lips of the wound are
sufficiently drawn together. After this^ closing, dress up the wound with
some agglutinatiue medicine^ made of such simples, as, mastix, thus, aloe,
sarcocolla, bolus armenus, terra sigillata, sanguis draconis, puluis humani
sanguinis, balaustium, malicorium, nux cupressi, plantago galla viridis, cauda
^quini, herba peti, etc. A powder may be thus compounded for the purpose:

also done by the continuance of a decent bynding, by ^it placing of the member,
by feames and glutinatiue medicines, and so long is it to be so ordered, till
the wound be justly joined again. Therefore after you have once so applied
your remedies to the wound, you shall not again vnroule it, until the third
or fourth day Admit this tolerable in small and simple wounds, yet in all
great wounds, I avouch it very hurtful. For, after nature has wrought her
work of one dressing, she straight desires riddance of the excrements, made
in that business, and new nourishment of medicines, for her further
proceedinge: wherein if nature be not answered, a double damage ensues: as
loss of time to the curing, and generation of an evil quality in the wound,
by the long putrefying of the matter there. And this I take occasion to note
here, lest any man by this place, should confirm himself in an evil
custom. If it be demanded, what time should be limited to the ordinary
dressinges: I answer, twelve hours. Far otherwise (I know^) is the custom
of Barbours. But I write unto the sons of art.

Here also, a word or two, out of Paracelsus, for the manner of using, and
applying these medicines: First, he deuideth the whole time of the cure into
three parts, called his three ligatures. The first part, is the first eight
or nine d^yes, in which the wound is thus to be followed. Power into the
wound, some of your vulnerarie oil, balm, or unguent, warm, and fill it up
with your lintie properties, wet therein, or rather, (as he specially
approoueth) with the flowers, and simples remaining in your vulnerarie oil,
aloft then apply your plaster, and round about the borders of the wound,
lay the same flowers and simples, or (if you had rather) clothes wet in
oxyrrhodino: dressing it so every twelve hours.

If the wound be a foyne or prick, iniect of the oil or balm, into the
bottom. If it be in the h^^d^ lay first a linen cloth, or linte, dipped in
your oil, or ba^me, (but no distilled balm) into the bottom of the wound,
and fill up the same a^^er with flowers, beeinge wary of oppressing the
membrans: alofte lay ^n your plaster, as aforesayde^ and bind it vp^ Let your
plaster be this above said: or else the Sticticum in the annotations of the
sixth Chapter.

The second ligature, which begins after those eight or nine days, is thus
accomplished, with a fether dipte in your balm, touch the wound over,
thereupon then apply your plaster: and thus continue until the joints,
nerves, or such like parts (which were bare) be all covered with flesh.

Then proceed to the third ligatur^, which is done, by the only application
of the Sticticum plaster. This is his course in all great wounds, for the
preuentinge of accidents. In small wounds there needs less curiosity.


after, vn^esse pain or inflammation, or other symptom arise. But the fourth
lay you shall look upon it. Whether the wound be joined together or no: if
it be not, then foment the same with some sour astringent wine, being warmed,
and after put thereon some powder astringent, and glutinatorie, together with
terebentine, or some of the aforesaid plasters, etc.

The last intention is the forestalling of accidents, as flux of blood, pain,
inflammation, and such other, which are easily prohibited in small wounds, if
immediately after the closing together the lips of the wound, you minister
upon it a stupe, wet i^ the white of an egg, beaten, and afterward rightly
^owle up the part: For this shall prevent the coming, both of bloody flux,
pain, and inflammation.

Then proceed to the third ligatur^, which is done, by the only application
of the Sticticum plaster. This is his course in all great wounds, for the
preuentinge of accidents. In small wounds there needs less curiosity.

CHAP. VI. Of a deep and privy wound received in the flesh without loss of
substance.
THis wound has two special indications to institute the cure by, according
to his situation in the member, either vpwardes or downwardes. As for the
first, if the Orifice of the wound look downwarde, and the bottom be
upward, so, as the matter may freely, and pronewise flow out of the wound,
such a one is to be joined both by an orderly ligature, such as may begin
above, and end below, where the orifice is, as also by stitching and
glutinatiue medicines, such as before are set down in the cure of a simple
wound in the flesh. But if contrariewise the orifice be upward, and the
bottom of the wound tending to the lower parts, so as there is therein a
restinge place for the matter: then here is use for the second indication,
which notes a neces^itie of If from the beginning, the wound be so dressed,
as that first it be cleansed from the bottom, with iniection ex vino, myrrha
and sale coctis, (the part so placed as that it may run out again) and then
dressed up with your vulnerarie oyl^ iniected, and Sticticum plaster alof^
applied, with an ingenious bolstring and rouling. I^ this course (I say) be
taken every dressing, from the beginning, and nature not otherwise vexed by
barbarou^ ^enting, very seeldome shall such incision come in use.
incision for the healinge of this wound. which incision must be made, either
from the orifice down to the bottom, or else in the bottom only, that the
matter may go out. But whether way is the most expedient, you shall learn,
by consideringe the nature of the place, and greatness of the wound. For if
you find the place dangerous to make incision in, and the wound it self go
deep, then is it more expedient to open the same in the bottom. Otherwise, if
it be shallowe and the place without danger, it is best to make division
down from the orifice. Afterward minister some mu^difyinge medicine upon a
sauft stupe or cloth, and let it be shifted twice every day, etc.

CHAP. VII. Of a hollow wound, with loss of substance in both the skins,
and in the subject flesh.
THE causes and signs hereof, being easily apprehended, as also the accidents
manifest, we will pass on to the cure, after the consideration of two notes
that concern judgment in it. The outward coming causes, Prog.
beeinge not removed, do hinder generation of flesh and also healinge. Also
accidents coming upon the wound and not removed first, do prohibit the
curation.

Let the first intention therefore, Cure.
in this case, be, to remove outward things incident to the wound, as
darts, or other things inflicted, hayrs, filth, etc. with instruments
convenient. Then next to cure the wound it self, which being hollow, requires
a filling with flesh, and that in regard of the quality of the wound, and of
the excrement: which in the generation of the flesh it engendreth^ which
excrement being of two sorts, a thicker called sordes, and a thinner called
sanies, (the last making the wound to moist, the other filthy) must be met
withal, with medicines of a double quality, to wit, meanly drying and wyping,
called commonly incarnatiues, of which sort are these simples: thuris lachryma,
thus, cortex thuris, mastix, aloes, v^num rubrum, austerum, colophonia, pix,
resina, farina hordei, and faenugraeci, These are fit for children, or
effaeminate bodies.
aristolochia, iris, farina orobi, farina lupinorum, panax, These may you sort
out, for bodies or parts of drier temperature.
centaurium, polium, glutinum, cadmia, Pomph^lyx, plumbum, antimonium,
Chalcitis, And these last, for parts or bodies, far more dry: wherein also
must be observed, that the minerals be first artificially prepared, by burning
and washing. But if your balmes and plasters be right, what need these new
devises of incarnatiues, and I know not what? I will in no wise, be guilty of
these strayings.

of quality, contrary to the property of the di^sease: so must you likewise
further observe, to intend or weaken the force of your medicine, according to
the state, both of the wound and temperament, both of the whole body and
wounded part, as thus: The natural temperature, both of the whole body, and
of the wounded part, must be conserved and kept, by things agreeable, or like
unto it^ but that distemperature which falls in, contrary to nature, must be
driven away by contraries^ for it perishes whatsoever is drawn into a
contrary plight, and by a contrary thing. Accordinglye therefore, a wound,
the moyster it is, the dryer medicine does it need. But withal, the nature
of the body, by how much the moyster, by so much the less drying medicine is
required of it. Wherefore if there be wounds in diverse bodies, in which
wounds, there is a like humiditie: that wound that is in a dryer temperature
of body, needs more drying, and that in the moyster, so much less, as there
is difference betwixt those two natures: if so be you mean to make the new
flesh aunswerable to the old. Likewise^ on the other side, where the old is
dryer, it is convenient, that the new be dryer also. And so this must have
drying medicines more plentiful, yea and by how much more it is the dryer, by
so much the more drying faculty must your medicine have. And contrariwise, in
a moister nature, so much the less of drying medicines need you, as the flesh
in that party, is less of nature, dry. The same reason stands whole, to be
observed in his diet also. Accidents, whether they be present, or you fear
them: are to be either prohibited, either else removed, as has been said in
other places.

ANNOTATIONS.
a These are fit for children, or effaeminate bodies.

b These may you sort out, for bodies or parts of drier temperature.

c And these last, for parts or bodies, far more dry: wherein also must be
observed, that the minerals be first artificially prepared, by burning and
washing. But if your balmes and plasters be right, what need these new
devises of incarnatiues, and I know not what? I will in no wise, be guilty of
these strayings.

CHAP. VIII. Of an equal or filled wound.
THE signs of an equal, plain or filled wound, are manifest, so as I need
not stand upon the^. I will therefore come to the cure, after I have laid down
this note, that may direct you, in the delivery of your judgment concerning
this case. Prog.
it is this. The matter of the skin considered, which takes it beginning from
the seed, it is euiden^ that the like to that which was lost in a^l points
cannot be gotten by art again: but notwithstanding, some like things and which
may fulfill the office of that which is lost^ may be restored, being yet, not
plainly the skin.

Cure.
In the cure hereof, are two general scopes or intentions to be had: The one
respecting the wound it self: the other the accidents. The wound therefore,
being now plain and equal, must be cicatrized and covered with skin. This
is to be performed, by medicines, which do consume not only superfluous,
but even the natural moisture also, and they be such as have some measure of
astringent faculty, but very much drying. of which sort here follows both
simples and compoundes. Simples drying and astringent of themselves, are Galla,
balaustium, ostrea vsta, cortex malorum granat^ bedeguar, sumach, spina
aegiptia, bolus armenus, terra sigill. cerussa, plumbum, vstum and lotu^,
lithargyrum, cortex pini, etc. Other do it accidentally: as, aes vstum and
lotum, squamma aeris, alumen, vstum, and lotum, vitriolum vstum and lotum,
plantago, aristochia vsta, soleae calceorum. Compounded medicines be these: an
Epitheme: balaustia and sumach boil in vino austero, and therewith foment the
wound. A powder: Rec. corticis pini,.j^ nucum cupressi, centaurij minoris,
aristolochiae vstae, ana,.ij. cerussae, lithargiri, ana,.ss. make thereof a

ol. rosati, li.j. ss. cerae albae,.iiij. make it a plaster.

The accidents incident unto this ca^e, Accidents
are concerning the vncomlines or deformity of the cicatrice, which must be
amended by medicines accordingly: as if it be too nesh and tender, you must
thicken it, with diachilon, or, cum lithargyro nutrito, or with oil, in which
radices bryoniae are sodden, or calamintha in oleo cocta, or argenti spuma cum
rosaceo albo, lota, etc. Contrariwise, ouerthicke and hard ci^atrices, are to
be attenuated, with ^leum basa^itae, radic^ cucumeris agrestis, stamped and
applied, Pinguedo asini, cum argenti spuma. Oleum de lilio, d^ myrrh^. All
kind of gummes dissolved in aqua rosacea. Or this distilled water: Rec.
myrrhae, aloes, styracis vtriusque, ana,.j. mumiae, baccarum lauri, ana,.ss.
grynde them indifferently, and with a glass limbecke, at a saufte fire,
distill them, and use the liquor of it. If the cicatrice bear an evil color,
which is another deformity, then to bring it to a witness, use those means:
Rec. ol. de tartaro,.iij. mucilag. sem. Psillij,.ss. cerussae in ol. rosae^
dissolutae,.j. boracis, or ^alis gemme,.ij. make thereof a liniment. A plaster
for the purpose is this: Rec. axungiae suillae,.iij. lithargiri,.j. ^ruginis
rasilis, v^rioli combusti, ana,.ij. make it a plaster.

CHAP. IX. Of a wound having o^ergrowen, or proud flesh.
A Wound ouergrowen with flesh is both an instrumental disease, Def.
in quantity, and also a common disease, in respect of solutio^ of unity.

Cure.
As it is an instrumentarie dissease, to wit, with flesh too prowdly growing, it
is to be dealt withal with medicines, that may diminish and take away the
same, such as are those, that be sharp and drying: namely, Chalcitis,
vitriolum, alumen vstum, radices asphodelorum, hermodactilorum, nucl^i
dactylorum vstorum, semen vrticae, serpentaria, squamma aeris, aes vstum, cinis
^rinacei, stupae minutim incisae, puluis mercurij, calx viua. sublimatum,
hydrargyrum etc. Compounded medicines for the purpose you haue^ vnguentum
AEgipciacum, or apostolorum: or such as follow you may provide: Rec. aquae
vitae ij. aeruginis rasi^is,.ij. mix them. Or Rec. hydrargyri sublimati, ij.
aluminis crudi^ v. aquae rosarum, vel plantag..vj. boil them to the
consumption of the fourth part. Another: Rec. salis nitri, vitrioli romani,
aluminis, ana,.ss. hydrargyri sublimati, ss. aquae plantag..vj. aceti, ij.
boil them as aforesaid. But when you minister these medicines, it behooves to
defend the place, in applying about the wound vnguenu^ de bolo armeno. If
further deling then thus be required, it is done with chirurgicall applying of
the incision knife, cauterie, hot scissours, etc. lastly, the common case this
wound has in respect of solution or breach of unity, requires his
conjunction, or rather cicatrization, which, how it is done, is now before
declared.

CHAP. X. Of the wound in the synewe, tendon, and ligament being pricked.
WHat thing it was whereby such a prick was given, Causes and signs.
is best understood by the Patientes tale: and whether it be a nerve, tendon or
ligament that is pricked, it is easily seen. He means, it is easily scanned
out, by artificial conjecture.
if a sinewe be wounded, there is great pain, hurt of both sense and motion,
sometime a fever, inflammation conuulsion and rauing.

then respect the substance of the part that is hurt, that it be defended,
and kept from all injuries thereto incident: against which, you shall well
provide, if you prevent the generation of inflammations: which by diet and
bloudletting shall be aptly done. Let his air therefore and place where he

the contrary parts. Let the bellye be kept loose, by cly^ters, or laxatiue

Again, cold air hurts, for that it is an enemy to the synewes. so let him
avoid moving, much meat, and such like. Let blood also, although there be no
fullness of the body apparent, so that there be strong virtue and liuelihoode,
and no other thing of sufficient value withstanding. And in this doing have
always due regard to the affinity of places. The substance of the part being

is communicated to those that be not cut, and so again the fibers that be
vncutte, stir up a conuulsion. But if all the nerve be cut a sunder,
there is no further fear, neither does any other danger ensue, save
weakness of that part. If such a ligament be hurt as goes from bone to bone,
to join them together, it is most without danger: and with whatsoever
medicines you dry the same you shall not offend the party. But if it be such
a one, as inserteth it self into a muscle, look how much it brings less
danger, then if it were a synewe or tendon, by so much the more (unless it be
rightly and diligently cured) is it more perilous then the other sort of
ligamentes. If in a wound of the synewes a tumor appear, and afterward
vanish, it threatens the peril of conuulsion or rauing.

Cure.
First (as I have often admonished) provide, that no outward thing remain in the
wound. Secondly for the conservation of the substance of the part from
inflammation and conuulsion, let blood largelyer then in the case of a sinewe
pricked, and appoint a convenient diet, as temperate air, rest^ a sauft bed,
little meat, and anoint the flanks, neck, head and chinebone, with store of
oil. On the other side, air either too hot or cold hurts, so does moving,
surfeting, drunkenness, etc. costiuenesse of the belly, etc. Thirdly with the
wound it self deal in this manner: if the skin be not open enough, make
the entrance wider. Then ^oyne again the nerve (if it may be) with He has

CHAP. XII. Of a wound in the veins and ^rteries.
WHether this wound was given by sword, Causes.
or shaft or the breach was made by a fall, or to much fulness of the body, else
some crush, as of stones falling on, or the vessels be f^etted out by color
or some salt humor, all this I say, partly by the patients telling, partly by
the proper signs of humors may be acknowledged.

That there is breach in some vessel, signs.
profusio^ of blud is evidence enough, but whether it be a vein or artery,
these signs shall testify, to wit, the flowing of thicker and blacker blood,
without pulslike moving, shows a bleeding vein: but the blood of an artery
is thin, and yellowe, and comes forth leapingwise.

An artery cut overthwart, Prog.
is sooner joined and healed, then if it were divided longwise. And an artery
is harder to heal then a vein. Flux of blood is perilous. for unless it
stay or be stopped, it brings death unavoidably because blood is the
treasure of nature. sounding, conuulsion, rauing, or yesking in the flux of
blood, betoken evil.

C^re.
This cure has in it two general scopes: the first is to stay the blood, the
second to cure the wound. To stay the blood you have diverse ways to
practice: and first by turning the course of it, either by drawing to a
contrary part, or else deriuing it oth^^ whether it is drawn to a contrary
part, without euacuation, by cupping without scarifying, frications, and
ligatures on the opposite parts of the same side. It is turned away with
euacuation, by opening a vein on the contrary part, and letting it flow,
and stay again, by times. And the deriuing of the course of it other-whither
is done by opening a vein in some part near unto the wound. The second
means to work withal, is to bridle and intercept the furious course of it,
by things that may thicken, astonish, or cool. These thicken the blood, to
wit, len^es, oriza, iuiub^, mala cotonea, etc. fructus omnes stiptici, etc.
this does astonish the headie rage of it, to wit, cold water, either drunk, or
applied round about the place whence the blood flows, but not upon the place
it self: for a cold thing is biting to an ulcer: cooling thinge^ be reckned,
faynting, sounding, etc. the third means to be used, concerns the place it
self, and stands partly in the use of the hand, partly in the application
of medicines. The means to be used by hand are sundry: as either the
application of the finger upon the mouth of the wound, and pressing it sauftly
without pain: or applying a ligatur^ or rolling upon the member, of sauft
lynnen, and making your first 4. or 5. boughtes. or turns, upon the very
wound and vein that bleedeth: winding up the rest toward the root of the
vein, if so be the wounded part be such as you may do it, and commonly you
may do it in all except the membrans of the brain. or use stitching to it (the
wound being first cleansed from clodded blood) drawing so the lips of the
wound together into one, either with a common stitch, or else such one as
coddars, or peltmongers use to make: especially if the blood flow with great
force. but while the wound is so institching, care to take your stitches deep
enough. and after it is stitcht, apply an astrictiue powder upon it, and aloft
on it the like powder mixte with the white of an egg, laid on upon s^uphes: so
bind up the member, and place it conveniently. If the vessel that bleedeth,
lie deep, it is good to cut it through, and then to apply some staunching
powder and bind aloft spong, or stuphes wet with astringent medicines. If the
vein or artery lie in sight, or may aptly so be come to, take it up and tie
it fast with a silk threede. Afterward apply to the wound some glutinatiue
medicine, and roll up and place the member orderly. The last manual
administration is, with a cauterizing iron, to make a crust, or escar: which
specially serves when the vessels are fret thorough, by putrefactio^. Medicines
now for the stopping of blud may in diverse sorts be ordained, and some of the^
such as work their effect by a manifest quality, others by a secret or
unknown property. Of manifest quality for that purpose, are these plasters and
powders following: Rs. thuris, aloes, ana parts aequales, excipiantur albumine

use. I said there be some things, that by a secret property do work this
feate: so does puluis b^fonum, in fictili cooper^o combustorum, which being
clossed in a little bag, must be applied to the vein that bleedeth, four
fingers from the wound.

The symptom of bleeding being stinted, the ioining of the vein or artery
must then be looked for, and procured by medicines consolida^iue, it being
noted that the artery requires so much the more drying medicines then the
vein, as it is naturally of a dryer te^perature then the vein. Therefore a
wound that lights on a vein, and that without loss of substance, desires
the same kind of cure, as that, that is in the flesh: but in case that a
vessel be tied, or you have used stanching medicines, or cauterizing yrons, so
that there is loss of substance committed, then are you to use the same
medicines, which hereafter are set down, in the cure of hollow vlc^^s.

ANNOTATION.
a See the note, upon the accident of bleeding in the first Chapter, here also

the blood. For the opportunity, that you be not too hasty, if the blood be
^oule, or the vessels f^^t. For the manner that you wisely regard the incident
occasions: as wrath, drunkenness, veneri^, etc. and in all kinds, to keep
the part covered from the air.

or cuttingwise, may be understood of the patient: and by sight, it will
easily appear, whether the bone be through cut, or but in part. And so it
falls out sometime to have these accidents: to wit, flux of blood, vehement
pain, conuulsio^ and sounding^

If great bones, Prog.
such as the arm bone (called humerus) or both the fociles in leg or arm
be cut in sunder so as the marrowe go foo^^h, it is most dangerous, and for
the most part that member perisheth^ so if Erysipelas come in the baring of a
bone it is evil. Childrens bones divided, do join again by themselu^s. In
the other ages, to wit, of the stripling, young man, perfect man, and old man,
their bones being divided, are never after by themselves rightly ^^ stored
again, but by the help of another substance coming between as a certain
glewe.

In this cure, Cure.
provide first for the taking away of symptoms, or accidents. If therefore
there be any outward thing infixed, or pieces of bones, pluck them forth. Yet
taking much heed, that you draw not out ^odenly, or with great force, any
part of the wounded bone: specially if it be great in quantity: for so doing
the patient should hardly escape a fist^la, conuulsion, rauing, or fever. It
shall be better therefore, to defer their taking forth, till another time,
and in mean while, to help nature with some drawing medicine: but if it might
be done, without violence, it is better first, then later. The other
accidents: as inflammation, fever, pain, if they be not come, prevent them,
if they have already taken houlde, remove them: either by emptying or
reuulsive bloud^etting, by thinne^ and cooling diet, by purging, according to
the nature of the abounding humors, or mitigating medicines, etc. If need be.
Having (...) ^idde the wound of bones, and your way, of the thorns of
encombring accidents, and provided a clear entrance to the cure, proceed on
this wise. Join again together the distant parts, and provide, that so they
may continue. stitch the wound that is in the flesh, with deeper and stronger
stitches then ordinary, afterward apply a tent in the most decliued part, but

artificially contrived, for all parts. And in this note also I touch the most

be cut through, then after the making of your stitching, apply the first

undo that rolling till the wound be thorough cured: unless some pain, ytch
or inflammation, growing in the part, compel you thereunto.

CHAP. XIIII. Of wounds of the head and Contusion.
WHether the hurt be committed by a cutting, Causes and signs.
pricking or brusing^ thing, may be easily understood of the patient, or those
about him. And whether it be a wound, or contusion, the matter likewise is
manifest. Whether the skul be broken, it is thus to be coniectured: to wit, if
the fall was from high, the contusion great, pain, thinnes in the skin
perceived by touching, separation of the skin from the bone, and moisture
bubling up through the cleft at the parties stopping his breath. Also an
apoplexy, giddiness, speachlesnesse, the head ^eelding an vncleare sound
being stricken on with a wand, and the teeth gnashing at the striking of a
threede holden between them: these (I say) are signs that the skull is
broken. So these signify that pia matter is hurt, to wit, pain giddines^e,
redness of the face and eyes, dimnes and ^trouting out of the eyes, the face
full of pushes, bleeding at nose, ears and palate, difficult speech, a fever,
casting down of the strength, astoniednesse of the senses, watching, loss of
appetite, with loathing, vomitting, etc. Signs of the brain hurt, are,
thick, round clodded and marrow like matter, deprauation of reason (if the
wound be in the fore parts) and hurt of the memory (if it be in the hinder
part) also astonishment and dotage.

A fracture in the skull is perilous. Prog.
incision of pia matter and of the brain is death. so is the corrupting of pia
matter deadly. A sharp fever, a crampe, trembling, alienation of the mind,
sounding, abridging of speech, redness and dim sight, all these be
fearful signs, and mortal, specially if they continue, and do not s^acke.
Also Dura matter becoming black, so as it will not be put away by the
application of mel betokens death. So does a great swelling, specially if it
vanishe soudenly with out reasonable cause, signify evil. Contrariwise, the
swelling little and the matter well digested, is a good sign. so is redness
of the flesh in the consolidation or time of souldring of the skull. In the
fracture of the skull, the term of the cure is to a hundred days, or 46.
according to others. A fracture of the skull is to be feared in the full moon.

The he^d being shaued, Cure.
provide for the remoouing of accidents: or preventing the^, if they be not
yet come. As namely inflammation, which you may do away, or prohibit, partly
by bloudletting on the Cephalica vein, so that strength, age and other
considerations forbid not: partly by diet, and partly also by loosing
medicines. for diet: Let the air be temperate, or a little warm, the belly
loose every day, either naturally, or by means of suppositories, or sauftning
clisters. Appoint also rest, and let the body lie on that side that is less
grieved, till there be perfect matter engendered: after that, on the pert
affected (that so the matter may easily flow forth) unless pain forbid the
same. Be spare in diet, till the danger of inflammation, and al other accidents
be past, the drink let be Small ale o^ ^.
sodden but all these hurt, to wit, cold air, moving costiuenesse, large
diet, meat that sends vapors to the head, wine, etc. And as for the
loosing medicines, see they be of the gentler sort, and of property according
to the dominion of humors in that body. If blood flow, let it be staide, and
so of other accidents as ^ath now often been said. Then if the wound be a
simple one in the flesh, without the loss of substance, unite the same either
with ligatures, or stitching as is aforesaid. If there be loss of substance,
renew flesh, and after induce a cicatrize, as has been said in his place.
If the wound be feared to be in the skull, and yet no certainetie thereof,
search with your finger or some apt instrument. If you remain yet doubtful,
and the wound is not ^ufficiently open, make incision in this form X. and
lay open the skull in that part, applying stuphes wet in viniger, to avoid
flux of bloud^ the skul thus uncovered: if the crack appear, but yet
uncertain, whether it go through, or no apply on the place the powder of
masticke mixed with the white of an egge^ and mark well the same plaster, the
next dressing, when you take it of, whether it be more notoriously dry in some
one place, for if it be, in the same place it betokens penetration of the
skull thereby. Now if there be a breach in the skull, certain and manifest,
and yet small, so as there is not easy issue for the matter, open the skull:
especially if there be fragments of the bone underneath, hurtinge the membran.
The skin you shall divide in form aforesaid, or thus X, and the bone so
uncovered, dress it up for that day, with lint, or clothes wet in oui candido,
the next day, opening the skull with a trepan, in which operation, consider,
diligently, whether the party be of strength to bear it: use prudent
forespeach of the likely danger. shun (in that action) the full of the moon.
Observations.
Beware the commissures as much as you may. Open the skull in the most bending
or decliued place, if it m^ye be. If the fracture be great, cut it not all
out: but it is enough if there be sufficient vent for the matter, and way to
take out the pieces of bones. All things that may do hurt to the membran,
take out with as much speed as may be. If there be any roughnes in the bone,
rebate it with a lenticuler. Defer not this work till the 3. or 4. day, but
perform it before either fever, or other symptom catch you. For the rest
afterward, proceed as in the cure of a great wound in the skull: which thus
must be handled. A great wound having way wide enough for the putting out of
matter, needs no enlarging by trepan nor Saw, but is to be mundified, and
after consolidated. Yet first must the fragmentes of bones, if there be any
hurting the membran, be spedily removed: as also the roughnes (if there be any)
rebated. Which things orderly done, first then I wish not the reader, for all
these, to depart from his balmes and plasters before commended unto him. unto

other. if any piece of bone stick so as cannot easily be plucked out, annoint
it with ol. rosac. that it may easilier loosen. When the wound is in the upper
part or top of the head, there is no need of stitching^ but in the sides
stitching is profitable. Many have accustomed to lay of a rams skin aloft,
and to charge the head with many happings but that likes not Hippocrates: for
it becomes but burdensome to the head, increasing heat, and prohibitinge
transpiration, or through-breathing. So much shall therefore bce enough to
cover the head, as that the brain may not be affected by the coldness of
the air. two or three days beeinge now spent in this order, pass on from
the use of the aforesaid medicines to this unguent or powder followinge,
serving to dry, incarne, and consolidate.

CHAP. XV. Of wounds in the face.
THE cure of wounds in the face is to be performed according to two general
indications thereto belonging, to wit, the symptoms, and the wound it self.
The symptoms considered, as they are, either imminent, or present: if they be
but imminent, and in danger to come, prevent them (as an inflammation) by
blood letting, such as does either draw to the contrary part, or derive or
empty the humors, if nothing let: else by cupping with scarification upon the
vertebres of the neck. Also by diet, fit and convenient: as spare quantity,
taking rest, keeping the body solluble, drinking sodden water, etc. avoiding
cold air, overmuch moving, plenteous meat, drinking of pure wine, binding of
the belly, etc. The body also would be lightly purged with such medicines as
be answerable to the nature of the abounding humors. If the accidents have
now found place already, displace them: as, pain, by mitigatinge, bloody
flux by stayinge: inflammation by putting it away, as is often taught before,
etc.

The second general indication is the wound it self, which requires to be
united: but in this doing^ there is special care to be had^ to preserve the
form and beutie of the face Therefore shall the stitches be taken thicker, and
nearer to the ^ide, for so it shall more firmly join together: or let it be
don by a dry stitch, as they call it. Sometime also when the first stitching
proves not fast enough, nor reteynes the lips sufficient close together, but
becomes slack, then the later kind of stitching is to be added to it. In
places ordained to move, the stitching may be made by needles pricked through
the lips of the wounds, and left remaining with their threede won about
both ends. No tent in this case is to be used, except the wound be very
deep, or that there be loss of substance. as for medicines the same shall
serve in this case as in other wounds. Some apply on the stitching, medicines
made ex duabus partibus, aquae vitae and vna ^^rebyn^hinae. Others apply

CHAP. XVI. Of wounds in the eyes.
Prog.
Wounds of the eyes are perilous, both for the sight it self, and for the
nerenes of the brain. But if upon the hurt the humor flow forth, then
follows destruction and loss of the eye.

To prevent inflammation (and so other accidents) which in this case, Cure.
by reason of the sharp pain, are like to grow, use reuulsion by blood letting,
(if nothing let) or cuppings applied to the neck. Also a thin diet, and
purginge medicines (if nothing hinder) according to the nature of the
aboundinge humors. To the forehead and temples, lay some repellent medicine, as
albumen oui diu^issime cu^ aqua rosaru^ agitatum. Or, collirium albu^, sine
opio, cu^ oui candido and aqua rosaru^ mixtu^. If there be pain present,
endeavor to mitigate it with applying lac cu^ collyrio albo, and mucilag. sem.
cydonioru^ extracta in aqu^ rosarum. If there be cluttered blood in the eye
through the stroke and con^usion, dissolve the same cum lacte m^ liebre mixed
with albumine oui: or, sanguine columbi ex ala de^racto, dropped in warm,
after the 2. or 3. day. Either else, medulla Or medulla panis a furno calida,

the wound it self requires to be united, cleansed and consolidated by
convenient liniment or collyrie: such as are these set down for your purpose.

CHAP. XVII. Of wounds in the eye liddes.
LEt the eye liddes being incised with their borders be stitched, and that
with a deep and firm stitch, that may be able to hold the parts long time
together lest their joining together through often moving, might be hindered. As
for perfourmance of the rest of the cure, observe to do accordingly as in the
cure of other wounds.

CHAP. XVIII. Of wounds in the nose.
IF the nose be wholly cut of, Prog.
it cannot be joined together any more: for unition in the organical parts, is
not possible. And if it be not wholly cut of, it may be cured by stitching. In
curing, Cure.
first set an order for the accidents after the same rate as is before spoken
of in wounds of the eyes. The second care is to look to the uniting of the
wound, by convenient stitching with a crooked needle, if it cannot be done
with a straight: but see that the stitchinge be deep enough. And before you
take any stitch: first see, by conueying your fingers into the nostrels, to
place the sides together in due order: afterward make a pipe of a goose quill,
and arm it with saufte linen clothes, conuaiing it so to lie within the
nostrels, that there may be thereby free passage for the breath. Of ligatures
and rolling Hippochrates says: they that are too curious in rolling, as they
are without reason, hurtful to many other places, so especially to the nose.
He says furthermore, if that the inner part of the nose be broken, it must be
again restored, by putting in your forefinger, or the patients, or a childs
^inger (for soft hands in this case, are necessary) and so place each part
in order again. But if neither the forefinger, nor least finger can be put in,
then do it with your probe: providing that this be don quickly, the first day:
or soon after: for that these bones, both admit there callous glewinge, and
are hardened also, by the 11. day, unless they fall to be corrupted. And as
within, so without like wise, the Artists hand must be working, to restore the
severed parts to their natural placing again. It is manifest therefore, that
to the nose, cannot a fit bynding be applied: but after stitching, some
glutinatorie water or other of that kind, or albumen oui, with a Because many

CHAP. XIX. Of wounds in the lips.
Wounds in the lips require a decent stitchinge, and the applicat^on of
those things that join and glutinate^ as also diligent drying and
astringentnes, in regard of the plenty of spettle, always moystening the
place. Very profitable shall it therefore be, ever to fome^t the place with the
glutinatorie water spoken of in the simple wound. Neither do these wounds admit
any ligature, otherwise then to the holding on of the medicines that are
applied. The lips of the wound in this case, are curiously and in equal
order, to be matched, and joined together, for the preservation of comely form,
which here is diligently to be looked unto.

CHAP. XX. Of wounds in the ears.
STitching is likewise required in wounds of the ears, and medicines both
mightily drying, astringent and glutinatiue, because the part is dry. Rolling
(says Hippochr.) of what sort soever, is an enemy to the ears. For as much
as if it be rolled, it is to no purpose to be slack: and if it be not slack,
it hurts very much: for all the ear will ache, beat, and inflame, if it be
but bound only. And it is sometime, the best cure, to apply no Here is meant

CHAP. XXI. Of wounds in the neck.
FOR the knowledge of the wound, what parts are hurt by the wound, and what
was the cause of the wound, to wit, whether a thing cutting or pricking, partly
by your own sight and senses: partly by conference with the patient, or
others, you are to receive instruction.

If a nerve in the neck be cut, there follows some maime. Prog.
A wound pearcing to the back marrow, is mortal and incurable. And if it come
not at the marrow, though it then be curable, yet is there a fear of the loss
of sense and moving of those parts, which these wounded nerves, taking their
original from that hurt part of the back, do serve. A wound that touches the
recurrent nerves, causes hoarcenes. A wound in the great veins and arteries
is perilous. A wound in the gullet, or in the wesand, is perilous.

For the preventing of inflamatio^s and such other accidents, Cure.
appoint in the beginning a slender diet, open a vein on the contrary part:
use purgation, according to the nature of the abounding humors^ and repellents,
or defensive medicines, to the parts about the wound. With the wound it self
deal thus: if it be only in a fleshie or musculous substance, then stitching
only is required with glutinatiue medicin^. If it be in the veins or arteries,
stay the flux of blood, either with medicines, or by application of the finger
to the orifice of the vein, or a^terie: as it happened to a certain man,
wounded in his outer i^gular vein, who by the diligence of his friends,
attending one after another, to hold their finger on the wound for three dayes^
escaped safe. Or if it may be, stitch the vessel. If you intend to do it by
application of the finger, be fure so long to hold it, til the blood in the
place be cluttered. Rolling is not convenient in this place: for that the
neck through the great vessels in it, and passage of the vital and animal
spirites^ may endure no binding or straitning. If the wound be in the gullet
or wesande, use then also stitching and glutinatiues: holding besides in the
mouth diasymphyton, diatragaganthu^, diapapaue^is, etc. If the wound have
touched the sinews, after a thin diet set, and using of reuulsio^s, purging
medicines, and repellentes: for the avoiding of inflammation, foment the wound
with ol. rosac. calenti, and use a mitigatiue ex oui vitello and ol. rosac. til
the party be set free from pain and inflammation. Afterward, when there is
perfect matter, apply this mundificatiue Rec. mell^s ros^^,.iiij. farinae

annoint the hinder part of the head and vertebres of the neck, cum ol.

terebynthina. For it is found out by sure experience, for the most part, that
both terebynthina it self, and his oil also, as well in these wounds, as in
those of the arms, do assuage pain, and hinder conuulsion.

CHAP. XXII. Of wounds in the shoulders.
Prog.
Wounds in the shoulders, are suspicious, in respect of the nerves, for the
perishing of sense and moving. Cure.
At the first setting to of the cure, provide for the forestalling of accidents
by these means: open a vain on the contrary part, if nothing ^et^ or use
cupping with scarifying. Also frication and ligatures on the contarie part.
Appoint a slender diet: keep the belly loose, avoid all moving of that arm,
keep the mind in quiet, etc. Further also, use purging, according to the
nature of the abounding humor: and repellent medicines to the parts about the
wound. Now for the wound it self, after removing outward things if any be,
come next to join it again by stitching and glutinatiue medicines: taking the
stitches deep, and ^owing fast, lest through the weight of the arme^ they
become loosed, and so the joining of the wound thereby be hindered. Beware yet,
lest any nerve in stitching be pricked: foment it with the glutinatorie water
set down in the simple wound. Apply aloft the stitching, albumen oui, cum
puluere restrictorio. Wet stuphes in oui candido, and ^leo rosa^o, and lay them
aloft. If you think it also necessary, you may use a tent, with digestive, in
the most decliued or bending part of the wound: and convenient firm rolling.
After the third or fourth day from the first dressing, arm your tent with
terebynthina, myrrha, and sarcocolla. Accidents (if here fall out any) must be
handled as has been taught before.

CHAP. XXIII. Of wounds in the arms.
Wounds in the bought of the cubite are perilous, Prog.
because of the great veins. Wounds of the cubite are suspicious for crampes,
inflammation etc. To prohibit pain and inflammation, Cure.
let blod on the contrary part, or use opposite cuppings, ligatures and
frecations. Provide the air temperate, set a moderate exercise upon the lower
parts: al rest to that arm: give slender diet, with meats of good juice, and
easy concoction. Keep the belly solluble etc. Purge after the nature of the
humors, and lay above the wound repellent medicines of cold iuyces. To the
wound it self, if it run but along the muscle, convenient bynding
suffices: but if it go overthwart, make stitching deep and firm, leaving a
tent in the lower part: and apply some astringent and glutinatorie powder,
mixte with the white of an egg. After the fourth day, do upon your tent some
clensing medicin. For accidents, I refer you to that is said otherwhere.

CHAP. XXIIII. Of wounds in the breast.
Causes and ^ignes.
Whether the cause of the wound were some cutting matter, as a sword, or else
pricking^ as arrows, darts etc. by conference with the party you shall
understand. But what parts be affected by the wound, you shall thus
conjecture. If the breast be pearsed, wind puffs out by the wound,
especially if the patie^t close his mouth and nosterils, which shall easilyer
be showed, byholding before the wound either a candle burning, or combed woll.
If the heart be hurt, there flows black blood, with cold of the extreme
parts of the body, cold sweating, sownding, and the wound in the left side,
etc. The lungs being wounded, the blood is reddish and frothie, his face pale
and wanne. Upon the hurt of the midreife ensues great and difficult breathing,
coughing with rattling and pain, alienation of mind^ blackish spettle, thirst,
loathinge of meat, rigor, and the wound situate about the false ribs.

Wounds of the heart, Wounds in the lunges are very of^ten cured.
lungs, Prog.
and diaphragma are mortal. Wounds that pearce the breast from the back ward,
are more dangerous than those on the forepart, by reason of the veins,
arteries, nerves, gullet, rough artery, and ligamentes of the heart. Those that
pearse not into the cauitie of the breast, are without danger.

First, to forestall the impendent accidents, Cure.
endeavor by blood letting on the contrary side, cuppings, frication and
ligatures, or bindinge of the extreme parts. Cease the party from moving See
that the belly answer his turn, and for meat give almonde, barley, or
reason broths, and such nourishments. Let his whole diet be cold and dry,
slender, and not astringent in the beginning, for causing straitness of breath.
His drink sodden water. Convenient purging likewise is to be provided
according to the nature of the humors: as cassia, mumia, Diacatho^^^^n, or,
sir. ros. lax. taken by the mouth. or otherwise sauftening clisters min^stred
beneath. By these means (if a fever do come) you shall put it soon to flight.

ribs. If the patient be strong, let the incision pearse into the cauitie, but
if he be weak, then is the incision either not to be made at all, or else not
to pass the succingent membran. If there be fracture of a ribbe, apply to it
Emplastrum oxycroc^um, so notwithstanding, as that the place of the wound may
remain open, for the issue of the matter: and whilst you dress the wound,
lay your finger on the fracture, that the ribbe go not forth of his place:

c Or in steed of these, some vulnerarie oil and plaster, as has been
showed before: and had need be noted in every chapter: that it must needs
appear an unworthy dealing, that is ordinarily committed by writers, in
running (ever anon) to these particulers, as though the balmes and oils set
down in their gen^rall tractation of wounds, must not be brought in use in
particular members, and parts. Now I request the Reader to ease me of this
labor in other places.

CHAP. XXV. Of wounds in the belly.
WITH what wepon this wound was inflicted, Causes and signs.
you may learn of the patient or others. What part is thereby affected, you
shall know by these notes: if the belly be p^arsed thorough, with your probe
searching, you shall perceive it, or by falling out of the guts, kell, or
such other. If the kell be hurt, it yields way through his substance and is
full of blood. Also it is black in color or swartish. If the small guts be
hurt, there is utterance of the extrementes, and the wound is above the
navel. If the great guts, the wound is beneath the navel, with utterance of
excrementes. If the stomach be hurt, Chylus goes forth, and the wound is
in the fore part. If the liver: flux of blood, the wound being on the right
side. If the spleen: issue of feculent matter, and the wound on the left side.
If the kidneis: effusion of watrish blood, the wound being in the region of
the kidneis^ If the bleddar be pearsed, there is issue of urine that way, and
the wound is about pecten. If the matrice be hurt, there is flux of blood,
and the wound is under the navel.

The great guts are easier healed, the smaller sort more hardly, Prog.
and the hungry gutte is not curable. The stomach, liver, etc. are scarce to
be cured. Unless there be speed used in the putting in of the intrels, they
become inflate with wind, through coldenesse of the air, and so are hard to
be reduced. So also, unless the kell be speedily prevented, for issuing out,
it is very soon altered and corrupted. Wounds and stitchings about the
midst of the belly are more difficult and dangerous then those about the
sides.

The impendent accidents^ as inflammation and pain, Cure^
must be prevented by blood letting reuulsiue. opposite cuppinges, frications
and ligatures. As also by thin and slender diet. If pain do come, it is to
be mitigated as in other places is said. Also for a tumor, or bubo, here
happening, you are to find address in his proper place. If there be
torments in the guts through their wounding, foment the belly with wine,
wherein has boiled semen anisi, and faeniculi, with other things that
discuss windiness, and chamomilla, and melilo^um, with other mitigatiues.
Now if the wound pearse the kell, it must be united and restored to his
place. If it hang out of the wound, tie it with a threede, and so cut off
that which hangs out, and after cauterize it even to the ligature, and then
put it in: but so as the threede may yet hang forth at the wound: which, at
the fall of the escar, may afterward be pulled forth therewith. Some use no
cauterie, because that which corrupts, will in process of time come fitly
away with the threede. The kell being restored to his place, the outer lips
of the wound are to be united and stitched, so as the stitch on one side be
higher, on the other side lower. The manner of this stitche (in few words
here passed over) I will plainelyer deliver out of approved practices. Take
your first stitch through mirach and peritonaeum, on the other side pearse
mirach only, so make your knotte. The second stitch begin on the same side,
but through mirach only: and over against it, pearce both mirach and
peritonaeum and knitte the ends together. Your third stitche (if you need
more) make like the first, and your fourth like the second, etc. t^ll you have
sufficient for your purpose.
If a gutte be penetrated and also hang out, first wash it with wine, wherein
absynthium, chamomilla, melilotum, anethum, and rosae are boiled. so after
stitch it with a skinners seame, letting both the threedes hang out at the
wound, that when that breach is healed they may be taken away. The gutte so
stitched, sprinkle it with masticke, or other astringent and glutinatorie
powder. Sometime the gutte is not hurt, but hangs out, and straightwaye
swells, with wind growing in it, so as it cannot be put again into the
belly: then shall you first foment the same with wine, where in has sodden
anisum, saeniculum, cuminum, cum melle. else divide a whelp, dove, or hen in
the midst, and sprinkle it with some powder dissoluing wind, and so apply
it to the swelled gutte. Bu^ if the windiness cannot so be discussed, nor the
gutte restored to his place, the wound then is to be enlarged, with a blunt
pointed instrument, (for the better security of the guts) and so the same
gutte restored to his place. Which done, the lips of the wound are to be
united and stitcht together as is said before. Let the patientes dye^ be
spare, and such as may be drying, astringent and glutinatiue: such as are
astringent brothes, or A wound drink in these cases, is very convenient. As
either the first of those, in the anno^ations of the chap. aforegoing, or this
of Quercetanus: Rec: boli armeni,.ss. consolidae ma. and mi. ana, m.j.
galangae,.ij. macerentur in balneo cum vini q.s. give thereof a sponefull

special regard had thereof, by adding some other special matter, for the
comfort of it.

shall be good to use also clisters extergent and glutinatiue, as thus made: ex
iure capi, vel intestinorum and extremitatum veruecis: wherein has boiled
hordeum chamomilla, anethum, and furfur, dissoluing also in the same broth, mel
rosarum and vi^ellos ouorum. Else otherwise make a clister astringent and
glutinatiue, ex vino austero, and.j. pulueris astrictorij, for the strengthening
of the guts, specially if the wound be in the great guts. Finally if the
wound have pearsed the liver, spleen, stomach, bleddar or matrice, their cure
yet differs not from those parts aforesaid, saving that these require
continual confirmation and strengthening, because of their necessary actions:
which thing yet is easi^ier performed to the stomache, then to the other
parts, both by things taken and things applied. For whatsoever things are
taken inwardly, have more force to work upon the stomach being hurt, then on
the liver, or spleen, by reason of length of way, and alteration of the things
taken.

ANNOTATIONS.
a The manner of this stitche (in few words here passed over) I will
plainelyer deliver out of approved practices. Take your first stitch through
mirach and peritonaeum, on the other side pearse mirach only, so make your
knotte. The second stitch begin on the same side, but through mirach only:
and over against it, pearce both mirach and peritonaeum and knitte the ends
together. Your third stitche (if you need more) make like the first, and your
fourth like the second, etc. t^ll you have sufficient for your purpose.

b A wound drink in these cases, is very convenient. As either the first of
those, in the anno^ations of the chap. aforegoing, or this of Quercetanus: Rec:

adding some other special matter, for the comfort of it.

Supply or addition to this chap. concerning accidents.
LIke as some time it happens to wounds in other places, so often times to
wounds in the breast and belly, to have hardness of the lips, and a fistulous
disposition toward the closing up. In such a case, besides your wound drink,
have ready this or such like oil, Quer^. de part. c. 4.

Prog. tr. 1. c. 17. Cure.
Wounds of the gendring parts are most perilous for pain, says Paracelsus.
The ordinary dressinges must be, as has been said for other p^^tes: but for
their inflammation and pain, provide a remedy ex farina fabarum, in vino and
aceto c^^ta, this warmed, apply and still renew, till the pain remit. Or in
place of farina fabacea, you may put lutum furnarium, and in like sort apply
it: for that both appeaseth pain, and defends the part: which thing is very
requisite in these places. If the pain thus cease not, Rec. florum chamomill^,
verbasci ana, m.j. olei q.s. coquantur, and fiat cataplasma. Which apply
likewise warm. If this serve not, the last remedy, and shoot anchor (in this
case) to flee unto is, Ebulus in vino coctus, and cataplasma^i^ mod^ applicatus.

CHAP. XXVII. Of wounds in the ^^gges.
Wounds in the knees and legs are much perilous: Prog
because those parts have greater interfoulding and packing of b^^es, ligaments
and si^ewes: and because those parts, for their inferior position, are more
subject to the descension of humors.

purging by vomit but not by stoole^ as for the wound it self, that must be
joined, according to the order of wounds in the arms: making a repelle^t
ligature or rolling, to keep the humors for flowing to the place: which is
don, by beginning with one end of the roll at lower end of the member, and
continue rolling upward, strict beneath, but toward the upper part of the
member, by little and little, looser. Now if there grow any pain, or
inflammation, all such are to be done away, as in their proper place is said
a^ore.

THE THIRD BOOK, ENTREATING OF Ulcers, and first, in general. Of the
differences of ulcers.
DIfferences of ulcers are taken, from their accidents, and from their causes.
From their accidents, to wit, quantity and place. So in quantity they are
either simple, or compounde. A simple ulcer is that, whereto no other affect or
simptome is joined. And a co^pounde is that, which is accompanied with another
affect or symptom: as an ulcer with distemperature, an ulcer with pain, an
ulcer with a tumor, with contusion, with proud flesh, with hardness and
discolourednesse of lips, with fowlnesse of the bone, with a malign nature,
called also Cacoethe, with worms, with burninge, etc. They that differ in
respect of the place, are either of the trunk of the body, or limbs. Of the
trunk, and that either perteining to the head, breast, or belly. To the head,
are Achor, or tinea, ulcer of the eye, tearie fistula, ulcer of the nose,
mouth, and ears. To the breast, such as bear the name of the breast. To the
belly, ulcers of the belly, secret parts, and womb. To the limbs: ulcers
of the armepittes, and arms, flanks, thighs^ legs and feet. Ulcers differ
in respect of the causes: as the humor being either hot or cold. Hot humor
is either choleric, ^hereof comes a virulent ulcer: or sanguin, whereof is
the filthy ulcer. Again the cold humor is either phlegmatike^ whereof comes
the hollow bankt ulcer, and fistulous ulcers: or else melancholicke, and so
bringes forth a cancrous ulcer.

pus.

^^uses and ^^nes.
The antecedent cause is either sanguine, choleric, melancholicke, or
phlegmatic humor thither flowing: as is above declared in the causes of
tumors. The conioynd cause is distemperature, pain, tumor, contusion and such
other, stirred up of antecedent causes. Whereof comes the generation of
matter, either good or bad: both which, have their notes to be known by: for
good matter is in substance, mean betwixt thin and th^^ke: also white,
light, equal and not stinking. Evil matter is thin glewie, much in quantity,
swartish, black, pale, stinking.

^^og.
Ulcers of the limbs are subject ^o inflammations and other tumors. Ulcers in
the neck, or about the ears in the head, do very commonly rise up in
swellings. If an ulcer eat and grow deeper, note diligently whether that come
to pass through the faultiness of the humors of that part, and malig^itie of
the ulcer, or else through the working of the medicines. Ulcers that are hard,
virulent, and waxing black, are evil. Cold ulcers are known by their
whitnes and sauftnes: hot ulcers by touching, and by their red color. Ulcers
that bear the color of the whole body, are evil. So are rownde ulcers, and
those that have bauld borders. lawdable matter is a good sign: vnlawdable,
evil. Also ulcers that either come yearly, or be of long continuance, are
hard to be healed. And those that lightly break out again, are apt to
change into a fistula.

First the humor flowing is to be euacuated, Cure.
and that either from the place whence it flows, or whether it flows. Let
blood therefore, if all things accordingly answer: appoint a diet as is meet
for the parties temperature, and humors reig^ing. and so also use your pu^ging,
according as is expressed in the treatise of tumors Likewise reuulsiue
bludletting, and boxing, liga^tures and frications on the contrary side, shall
dislodge the humor of his place, yea although it were drawn thither by the
place it self. And if it be not drawn thither, but sent only from else
where, then shall you beat it back, with applying vng. ex bolo a^meno, or
such like, set down among the tumors. The conioynd cause, to wit, How^oeuer it
happened, here was some great oversight: for neither is this according to Wecker
himself in other places, much less agreeable to truth or good order. For the
adiunctes or accidents of any thing, cannot be accounted with the causes of
the fame: neither was it the au^^hors meaning, I am verily persuaded. The place
may thus be restored. The humor in the part affected, feeding the ulcer, when
the antecedent cause is cut off, according to the order aforesaid, shall
easily be managed, and ^pent, by digestiues, and mundificatiues, and so the
place soon sealed up by incarnatiues, and cicatrizing medicines, such as are
before, and shall hereafter again be plentifully delivered.

CHAP. II. Ulcer with dist^mperature.
IF the distemperature be hot, Cause^ and signs.
it is known by heat, rednes, and releif at the applying of cold things.
Contrariwise, a cold distemperature is discerned by white color, light
rednes, and receiving help by hot things. Moist and dry distemperatures are
manifest.

First the symptoms, Cur^.
then the ulcer is to be taken away. And to deal with the hot diste^perature,
it is to be con^idered whither it be with matter, or without matter. If it be
with matter then whether it be sanguin, or choleric: for the sanguin, use
bloudletting, slender and cooling diet, with cooling medicines If it be
choleric, diminish the quantity with medicin^ purging choler, and temper the
quality with cooling means. Otherwise if the distemperature be hot and yet
without matter, then a simple cooling course suffices, both by diet and
medicines: as, vng. album, rubrum cum caphura, vng. ex pompholyge, vng. ex
plumbo, cerussa and such others: also aqua rosaru^, succus solani, semperuiui
etc. contrariwise, a cold distemperature is to be brought to a mean, both by
hot diet and medicines purging f^egme (if it abound) as also warming unguents,
to wit, vng. dealibeae, vng. citrinum, or a fomentation of warm wine, or lee,
or the decoction of absynthium, mentha, byssopum, pulegium, calamenthum,
origanum rosinarinum. Moist distemperature is to be corrected by drying diet,
and medicines, as vng. de pompholyge, de plumbo de cerussa, de gra^ia Dei,
diachalcitidi^. dry distemperature is to be altered with moystning diet, and
medicines, such as are, vng. basilieon, de pice, diachylon, dissoluing of them
in oil, and putting to.j. of them, pulueris rosarum.j. also fomenting the
place with warm water. The ulcer being thus delivered from all
distemperature, is to be cured then, according to his case. Namely a purulent
ulcer, if his matter be crude, is to be digested. If it be not crude, but
concocte, then is it to be mundified. So also a hollow ulcer, to be filled
with flesh, and a filled ulcer to be ioynde and brought to a cicitrice.

CHAP. III. Pain with an ulcer.
CAuses of pain in an ulcer are either distemperature, Causes and signs.
or solution of continuitie. The distemperature is either hot or cold, and
known by the singes declared in the Chapter going before.

According to which causes you shall also attempt the cure: Cure.
as if the distemperature be hot, correct it with cooling things: first
dealing with the easier sort, and after with the stronger. Simple^ of the
easier sortare, succus plantaginis, solani, semper^i^i, hyosciami, aqua
rosarum, solani, hyosciami, etc. ol. rosatum, albumen oui, etc. compounde
medicines of the weaker sort are, vng. album caphuratum, vng. de lithargyrio, de
minio, de thutia, de plumbo, and vng. rubrum cum caphura. also albumen oui cum
rosaceo. o^ bolus armenus, terra sigilla^a, cum aceto and rosaceo. or
Emplastrum ex malua, plantagine, furfure and rosaceo. or, Recipe vng.

these, may be made, ex farina hordei, ol^o rosato, and nympheae vel
mandragorae, boiled cum lacte, vel passo. or ex mica panis, in aqua infusa, cum
ol. rosaceo, vi^ellis and croco: whereto also add o^ij,.ss. another, ex folijs
papaueris albi, vel mandragorae, vel hyosciami, cum pul^ere chamomille. also
philonium, theri^ca recens, oleum de ranis, oleum papaueris cum opio, succus
hyosciami cum ^acte mulieris, and opio etc. Cold distemperature is amended by
bathing with warm wine, and applying vng. fuscum, basilicum, or ^i^rinum. Now
if the caus^ of pain be solution of continuitie, mitigate it with anodinous
medicines, and that either applied to the ulcer it self, or else to the parts
round about the vlce^: to the ulcer it self, a medicine, consisting ex
vitello oui, croco, terebynthina, ol^^ abie^is, and ^^saceo. To the parts
about the ulcer, pinguedo gallinae, anatis, anse^is, suis, etc. ^esypus,

Thus when the pain is removed, the ulcer is to be healed by the ordinary
intentions, of filling with flesh, and cicatrizing^

CHAP. IIII. Ulcer with a tumor.
AS in others so in this, the accident first must be removed and then the
ulcer cured. The accident is to be dealt withal, according to the humor whereof
it rises. If the swelling therefore be of a hot humor, consider whether it be
yet flowing, or else do^ rest, and settle in the part affected. If it be
flowing, it requir^th euacuation, both from the part whence it ^loweth (whether
it be the whole body, or some part) which is done by bludlerting, thin and
cooling diet, with purging medicines: as also from the part, whither it
flows: which is to be wayed in two respectes^ for either it flows to that
part, as being drawn of the part^ or else, as sent thither only. If it were
thitherto drawn, it must b^ drawn back again^ by bloudletting, cupping
fricatio^s and ligatures, al done on the contrary side. But if it were sen^
thither, then use bea^ers back, applying namely^ (...) boiled in vino austero,
or stamped: or, malum cotoneu^ acerbum, boiled cu^ puluere myrthi. or else a
medicine made ex lentibus coctis, and mix the^ cum puluere malicorij, rosaru^,
and terebin. Whereunto if you shall add sarinam fabarum, hord^i, ^ritic^, and
chamomillam, you shall ^ot only make the medicine more gentle, but in the
augmentation of the Tumor, more profitable also. If the humor be al resting in
the part affected, it is to be discussed with a cataplasme, ex decoct. maluae,
absynthij, in vino dulci, cum farina ^em, lini, fae^ugraedi, and furfu^e. or
else, (...) farinae tritici, oleo com^^ni, and croc^. These sodden in water to
the form of a pult^is. If the humor whereof this tumor r^seth be cold,
discuss it, with this plaster: Rec. mum^^ae ^d cr^ssi^iem in vino coctae^ ^j.
aesypi,.ij. farinae (...) ^ss^ boil them and ^ake them a cataplasme. The tumo^
thus done away, proceed to digest^ ^^^^difye, incarne, and consolidate the
ulcer.

CHAP. V. Ulcer with contusion.
A Contu^ed ulcer needs medicines moysthing ^ engendring good matter. as a
pulteis ex farina tritici, ole^, and aq^a sodde together: or, ex tritico aqu^
calida^ diu macer^to and cocto: else, ex radice alth^^ and c^ricis ^imul
^oc^is, cum farina triticea ad mellis cra^sit^em. For further addre^^e resort
to the curation of a contused wound.

CHAP. VI. Ulcer with proud flesh.
Proud flesh is to be abated, either by manual operation, or medicines. By
manual operation, as by the incision knife, cauterie, hot scissors, etc. The
medicines must be corrosiue: whereof you have store, both gentler, and
stronger. The easier are also of two sorts, differing in the more, and less:
as the more gentle are these: alumen ^stum, cum bolo: hermodactyli cum tartaro,
nuclei dactylorum combusti, aqua vitae cum sulphur, vnguentum apostolorum,
semen vrticae, squammae aeris, serpentaria, ae^, vstum, radix asphod^li, cinis
erynacei. Less gentle are these: to wit, p^luis mercurij, vnguentum
AEgiptiacum, vnguentum apostolorum cum aerugine rasili. Of the stronger sort,
you have both simple and compound medicines: simple, as Calx viua, chalciti^,
chalcanthum vstum. sublimatum hydrargyrum. Compoundes are thus provided: Recipe
hydrargiri sublimati..ij. aluminis cr^di,.v. aqua ros. vel plantaginis,.vi.
boil them to the wasting of the fourth part. Another: Recipe salis nitri,
vitrioli romani, aluminis, ana,.ss. hydrargyri sublimati.ss. aquae plantag..vi.
aceti,.ij. boil them as is said before. Note, that when you minister these
stronger medicines, you apply about the ulcer, vnguentum de bolo armeno. The
proud flesh thus abated, the ulcer must be cicatrized.

CHAP. VII. Ulcer with discolourednesse and hardness of the lips.
IF the hardness of the lips be^not great, seek to sauften, and resolve
the same with mollifyinge medicines: as pinguedo anseris, gallinae, anatis,
leonis, vrsi, vi^uli, bouis, etc. oleum liliorum, amigdal^rum dulcium, oleum
lumbricorum, ol^um vulpinum, etc. Oesypus, mucilago altheae, sem. lini,
faenugraeci, vnguentum basilicon, Diachilon, Emplastrum de mucilaginibus. But
if the hardness be great, it requ^reth incision, or cauterie, or else corrosiue
medicines: as, puluis mercurij, sprinkled on the lips of the ulcer, when they
are scarified. Or a powder thus prepared: Rec. lythargi^ij, lapidis h^matitis,
vitrioli romani, an^.ij. hydrargyrij sublimati,.ij.ss. mix them.

CHAP. VIII. Ulcer with the bone defiled.
Causes and signs.
THE bone first appears fattie, then after black, or rotten, and comes by
foul ulcers, or fistulaes: and those either cancrous, or of long continuance.

For the preventing of pain and inflammation, Cure.
provide first by bloudletting, diet and purging medicines, done according to
the nature of the humor. Then if the fowlnes be not large, nor deep, take it
of, either by skaling instruments, (rowme being made to it, in the flesh)
until that blood do follow, (which thing is very good in ulcers of the head
and spine bone.) Afterward apply thereto this medicine: Rec. rad.
aristolochiae rotundae, rad. ireos, and peu^edani, cort. panacis, cortic. pini,
cort. thuris aloes, ana,.ij. fiat puluis tenuis, qui melle, vel vnguento
AEgyptiaco expiciatur. If it be largely defiled, Calmet. li. 3. cap. 8.
nothing is more profitable then the hot iron: providing (specially, if it be
deep defiled) that after the applying of the hot iron, you bore the bone in
many places till the blood follow, applying in those holes also the hot
iron, to dry the bone: or else filling them with aqua fortis: so, by ^his
means, the bone shall dry, and ^y little and little cast his skale: nature
(in the mean time) getting flesh ^nderneath, for the preserving of the ^ound
bone, from the corruption of ^he air. so shall the skale fall of after, and
little or no moisture follow. Your medicine the first iij^ d^ies, after ^he
application of the cauterie, for ^he loosing of the skale shall be, rosaceu^
^^lens cum oui alb^mine: and other iij. ^ayes following a digestive ex^oui
vi^ello and rosaceo, Call. loc. cit.
then after that, but ru^ ^^m melle. If the defiled bone lie so ^eepe, that you
cannot come at it with instruments, then make iniection with this water: Rec.
radicum aristolochiae vtriusque, iridis, ana,.j. ss. centaurij minoris,.j. ss.
agarici,.iij. symphiti, m.j. hyperici, pedis columbini, ana, m.j. herbae
Roberti, m.j. cort. pini,.ij. ros. rub. p.ss. anthos, p.ss. mellis ros..iij.
irrorentur omnia vino albo, and d^stillen^ur ^lembico plumbeo. With this make
iniection twice a day. The rest of the time of the cure, touch the bone
defiled with this water following: Rec. aquae vitae ter destillatae, aquae
rosarum, ana,.iij. sublimati,.j. coquantur lent^ igne, vsque ad sublimati
dissolutionem, and keep it in a glass. After the use of which water, it
shall be profitable to minister this powder: Rec. aristoloch. rotund. cort.
pini, ana, iij. radi^. peucedani, and arundinis, ana,.ij. agarici, tartari,
ana,.j. ss. euphorbij,.j. fiat puluis. With this powder sprinckle the putrified
bone: or mix it cu^ melle^ or, vnguento regis and mell^, or vnguento
AEgiptiaco: and therewith annoint the putrified bone, after the use of the
former water: laying aloft Emplastru^ diachalciteos, or diuinum, or this
following: Rec. cortic. o^orum, ossium humanorum, and panni combustorum, ana,
ij. rad. peucedani, pulu. lumbricorum, ana,.ss. emplastri de gratia dei,
diachylonis, picis naualis, ana,.ij. fiat Emplastrum: which is so excellent in

that you wisely measure the greatness of the heat of it to be but aunswerable
to the greatness of the corruption of the bone. Also if the bone be putrified
to the mar^owe, cut off the whole bone: unless it be in the spine, or ridge
bone of the back. In which, the best that can be done, is a palliate cure.

CHAP. IX. Malign ulcers, called Cacoethe.
THE causes of this malign, Causes and signs.
and hardlye cicatrized vlce^, are of two sorts: antecedent, and continent.
The antecedent, are abundance, either of good juice, or evil juice in the
body, or else some fault in the liver or spleen: all which are to be
coniectured, by the proper notes and signs. The continent causes are Varix in
deed is a cause continent, the rest are accidents.
distemperature, hardness of the lips, varicous or swelled veins, etc. The
signs of this unruly ulcer (called also^ Chironium) are, callous and swelling
lips, thin matter, ill savor, no inflammation, small pain, neither creeps
it^ but sometime dries up, and eftsoon breaks out again, and is most
resident in the feet or legs.

Prog.
The easiness, or difficulty of the cure of these kind of ulcers, is
coniecturable, according to the likelihood of taking away the causes
antecedent, or continent^ which needs must be removed, before the cure can be
accomplished.

And because fullness, that is a maintainer of this ulcer, Cure.
is twofolde, to wit, of good juice, or bad: we must advise (if we suppose
fullness, or abundance to be in fault) whether the body abound with good, or
evil humors: and so accordingly deal for the diminishing of them. If the body
abound with good juice, it must be diminished both in the whole, by
bloudletting, and spare diet, as also in the part whether it flows: either
drawn, or sent. If it come to the place by attraction and drawing of the part
it self, make reuulsion, by blood letting, cupping, frication, and ligatures,
all done on the contrary part. Otherwise, if the humor come not to the part
by attraction, but is received only, as a thing sent thereunto: then use your
means, both to beat back that which comes, and so discuss that which is
there already: as shall be said in the process of the cure. If the
antecedent cause be evil juice, wherewith the body aboundeth^ institute a diet
of such meats as are of good juice, and so may engender good humors, and be
an enemy to that humor that nourishes the ulcer. Let his drink be Guaiacum
water, and use purging medicines, according to the nature of the abou^ding
humors. ^isseasednes of the liver, spleen, or ^tomach, giving occasion to this
ulcer, must first be taken away, and then go to the cure of the ulcer. The
like is to be said of the continent causes: to wit, Varix in deed is a cause
continent, the rest are accidents.

SKabbednesse is a light vlceration of the skin, Def. ex Feru. li. 7. ca. 5.

It follows some moist pustule going before, (whether it were pale, swartish
or black) which being broken, leaves a moiste vlceration in the skin,
whereupon ensues the skabbe: mean time, there is itching, redness, heat,
pain, and such other accidents, more or fewer, according to the humor whereof
it has his feeding: which, be it choleric, flegmatike, or melancholic, you
shall know by the condition of the affect: painful, moist, or dry: by the
patients temperament, and other artificial indications of his course of life,

to repeat them now again.

Impetigo.
Impetigo, which we english a Tetter is a hard and dry roughness of the
skin, with great itching This rises by iiij. stairs unto the height, which
Impetig^, which rises with greter rough pustules, fretteth fiercelier, and
gaddeth more abroad. This comes often of Herpes miliaris, or exedens, in
their cure neglected. The matter hereof is hotter choler, or thicker salt
phlegm. In the third degree is Psora, ^sora.
which I call skurffines, wherein the skin is thicker, dryer, harder, more
swelled and rough, with creeping pustules^ which do eat, and cause it to
chappe all abroad, casting of black and brannie skales. This arises of
black choler, (we commonly also call it melancholy) put out into the skin,
and whereout it can hardlye be scattered. Lepra is the last, Leprosy.
and worthelie worst of all. This eats vehemently, and feeds and clifteth
deep: wherehence not only branne, but skales sometime pale, sometime blackish
do shead. It grows of black choler, wherewith some thick, and tough salt
phlegm is mixed. This last is accounted incurable. Prog.

XIIII. Alopecia, and Ophiasis.
Definition
ALopecia is a falling of the here, after which, certain vacant places are
left in the head. It differs from Ophiasis, both in figure, place, and age.
For Alopecia keeps no propper figure, but indifferently shows it self in
any, and is incident to the forepart of the head beard, eye brows, and any
age. But Ophiasis ever appears in one certain figure, Difference.
namely, not exceeding the breadth of two fingers from the nape of the head:
it creeps on with his two heads, to both the ears: in some to the foreheade,
never ceasing, till it have joined both his heads in the forepart of the
foreheade. And this disease is incident (for the most part) to young children,
and that to the head only.

Causes and signs.
They are engendered otherwhiles, of the naughtiness of some common matter, and
other sometime, of some special and peculier matter. It is meant to be of
common matter, when it comes of a common, and as it were, accustomed
putrefying of humors, which eat away the roots of the hears. For the hears
do come of certain dried vapors, resolved by moderate heat, which, whilst
they pass out through the pores of the skin, are thrust out into their form,
of length and roundnesse, and dried by the air. Which again do easily fall,
when as by some vicious humor they are stubbed up. And this may be serous or
thin blood: then is it with a red color in the skin, and in a young
flourishing age, a sanguine complexion: and in such one as has used meats of
much and good juice. Or it may be of choler, which you shall know by palenes
of the skin, choleric complexion, hot and dry temperature, hot diet, and
youthful age. It may likewise^ proceed of phlegm, either sweet or salt: the
sweet, is apparaunt by whiteness of skin, boyish age, cold and moist
temperament, and cold and moist nourishment. Salt phlegm also brings forth
white color ioynde with dandroufe, ytching, etc. If it be of melancholy:
blackenesse of skin, with melancholicke complexion and custom of diet, will
declare it. The peculier matter, which comes to be considered of in the
generation of this disease, is that which has, either by adustion, or malign
and pernicious constitution, gotten to it, a certain sure, and unwonted
malice, as in leprous bodies^ whose signs are: falling of hear, with great
deformity of face, hollow nose, round eyes, narrow drawn nostrelles,
swelled eyebrows, fleshie knots in the face, and duskie color etc. or else in
the french diseased persons, and signified by falling of the beard, eiebrowes,
and tuftie foreparte, before the rest of the head, also pains in the head and
ioints, wheales and skales in the head, and chinne, skurfe, sorelike
weariness, ytching about the face, cleftes sometime in the hands, and ulcers
(perhaps) going before in the privy parts. Other signs of the form of
these diseases, and their place, are manifest enough by the definition.

Prog.
To know whether there may be cure or not, two things must be considered: one
is the time: for if it be of late growing, it may be cured, but if it be of
long continuance, it is either impossible, or at the least very difficult. The
other thing is the affect or disease it self, and so Alopecia, which comes
of the leprosy is seldom, or never cured. Ophiasis sometime heals of the
own accord, and with out application of any remedy: but Alopecia does not so.

The cure Cure.
of these diseases must be instituted first according to the matter whereof
they proceed, be it common or else peculier, as is before described in the
signs. And then respecting the form, which comes to be amended by local
medicines afterward. If therefore you find the vi^iosity of the common humors to
be in fault, seek out also by the signs which of them it is, and thence
proceed to the taking of them away, in this manner. If it be serous blood and
choler, Diet.
appoint a contrary, that is, a cooling diet. As colder air, moderate
exercise, moderate sleep, or larger then of wont, the meat of good juice, as
flesh of hens, partriche^ capons and weather, sodde with lettuse, etc.
avoiding ho^e, sharp and salt meats. The drink, water that is boylde, etc.
observing warely, that (at no time) there be too great filling with meat. For
phlegmatic humors in this case, let the diet be with hoter air, temperate
exercise, moderate sleep, meat that has property to heat and make thin,
the drink, white wine delayed, etc. And the quantity of meat but little.
Otherwise also if the humor be melancholicke, let the diet be heating and
moystning: as hot and moist air, mean exercise, longer sleep, meat
engendring good blood, the drink, delayed wine, etc. the quantity also in a
mean. The diet thus considered of, ^anuall ^^eration.
as is meet: proceed to more manifest diminishing of the humor, by
bludletting, cupping, or sanguisuges, as the case offreth most conueniency.
Provided always, that in any of these, the age and strength of the patient be
considered: for the moderating of the quantity, Therefore these manual
operations find place, when this disease proceeth of sanguine, and choleric
humors. And the fittest places then for the opening of a vein, is Cephalica
first: and then some vein in the forehead, one done after another, with some
convenient time between. Cupping with scarificatio^ is to be used in the
circuit of the head, Bloud-suckers. Inward medicines.
sa^guisuges in the hinder part of the head.

Medicines convenient in this case, whilst the matter is serous blud, and
choler, are first^, those, that work contrary to the present quality of the
humor, by altering concocting and preparing the ^ame: of which nature are

syrupus acet^sus, with distilled waters, or the decoction of the like herbs,
whereof those sirupes are made. Then following after, with such purging as may
manifestly diminish the quantity of the offending matter, in general. Of
which sort, you have choice enough amongst these following: manna, cassia,
tamavindi, Diaprunum lenitiuum, Purgations.
Diacatholicon, syrupus ros. laxatiuus. syrup. ex flor. persicis, etc.

agregatiuae, Pill. sine quibus, etc. After which general euacuations, order
requires that the particular sort, as mastica^ories, of mastick, or pyrethrum
mildely sodde in syrup of rosses solutiue, do follow. In all which the
artist must have care, that by dew quantity, he perform that which is
sufficient: purging both often, yea and vehemently, if the age may bear it,
forasmuch as the humors are impact in the habit of the body.

If the humors offending be phlegmatic, Phlegm the cause.
first alter and prepare it, as with, oximel simplex or compositum, given with
a decoction of the roots of smaledge: likewise, mel rosarum, syrupus de
staeca^e, syrupus de betonica, sir. de capillorum ven. with the decoction of
maidenheare, veruaine, sothernewoode, or their distilled waters. Then purge the
same with Di^catholicon, hiera pi^ra, Hiera Ruffi, pillulae de agarico,
mirabolams chebulis, or such like: else, if stronger be required: Diaph^^icum,
Electua rium Indum maius, Pill^l^ cocbi^, pill. faetidae, pil. inda^, pil.

aforesaid, follow in order your particular ^uacuations by the mouth, to wit,
gargarismes, made of the decoction of figs, reasins, hissope, peniriall,
stecados, maioram, etc. else (if you would have them stronger) of the decoction
of pepper, and pyrethrum etc. or of mustarde seed, viniger, honey, etc.
masticat^ries also of mace, cubebe^, stauesagre, ^sarum, mas^i^h, pyrethrum,
either raw, or lightly boiled in oximel. In all which you must proceed with
the like observation as before is noted, to wit, that both the preparing and
also the purging be oft^ yea and vehement (the age and strength of the patient
considered) because the humors have taken root in the habit of the body. The
time is most convenient for them, when the patient is fasting.

If the melancholicke humor be cause of the falling of the hear, Melancholy
the cause.
the diet first ordained as is before described, here have you your
preparatiues first to concocte and make ready the matter: to wit, oximel
compositum, oximel scilliticum, syrupus de fumo terrae, syrupus de lupulis etc.
with the water of hoppes. Euacuate then the whole body, either with some of
the gentler sort, as Diasenna, diacatholicon, mirabolani Indi, senna, lapi^
armenus etc. Or with these stronger sort, as Hiera Ruffi, confectio hamech,
Pil^ulae de fumo terrae, pill. de lapide lazuli, Elleborus niger, etc. Lastly
descending to the particulars, as gargarismes of the decoction of pyrethru^, in
the decoction of mercury and time. Eleborus niger, confectio hamech, etc. and
these things likewise must be often repeated, and strongly performed, for
the consideration, before, now twice rehearsed. When all this course has
been dewly followed, for the rooting out of the matter of this disease, that is
to say, the common humors of the body, which are found faulty in this case:
then come we justly to the use of local medicines: Outvvard medicines.
which likewise are not a little a^aileable in the matter. Of which sort are
these: Oleum laurinum, oleum ouorum, oleum nucum, oleum lucernarum, ol.
abrotani, oleum ricininum, oleum Iuniperi. axungia tal^ae, axungia vrs^,
axungia lupi, leonis, anseris, cuniculi. Moreover, the ashes of sothernwoode,
of bears hear, or of man's hear, the ashes of moles, sea yrchins,
spumaemaris, of tap sia, euforbiu^, bees, waspes, etc. of which things may be
made vnguentes and lees, of diverse sorts, such as here, for example sake, I

have spoken of the falling of here, coming of a common matter, as the
vitiositie of the four humors^ and so much suffices our purpose.

CHAP. XV. Brannie scales in the head.
THis is a disease in the out side of the skin of the head: De^.

with a light scratching.

Causes and signs.
The thing it self is euidentlye known by ytching, and skales in the head.
But of what cause it is, as whether of corrupt blood, burnt choler, salt
phlegm, or burnt melancholy, you shall know by the consideration of such
notes as are given you in the acknowledging of Alopecia.

If it be not cured in a convenient time, Prog.
it changes into the leprosy.

If it proceed of ferous or corrupt blood, Cure.
institute a diet contrary in quality: to wit, D^et.
let the party use moderate exercise, temperate sleep, a quiet mind, meats
of good juice, not windy, nor gross. White wine delayed, etc. Forbid beef,
venison, and gotes flesh, also bulbous roots, musheromes, puffes, potherbes
and banqueting dishes. So may you bend the force of your dietarie
prescription against the faultiness of the other humors (if you see it good)
by the order foreshewed in Alopecia.

Also in this case (of blood) phlebotomie is convenient: Med. inward.
and other medicines, both altering, concocting and purging: generally, and
perticulerly, in manner, as is before set down, in Alopecia.

Observe the order of that chapter likewise, if choler, phlegm, or melancholy
be, Outvvard
in this case, faulty. The cause of the disease then being thus provided for,
come to local medicines, to cure the present place withal. Which you must
prepare, of wiping, dispersing and drying things. Such as are lupini, ciceres,
orobus, faenumgrecum, cineres betae, brassicae, abrotani, cucumeris asinini,

Causes and signs.
THis is a disease chiefly of the inner skin of the head. But sometime of
other parts also, as the beard, arm pittes and share bone, in which parts
lyce are engendered, of diverse forts^ some without the skin, as those of the
head: and those called Of some partlyee they be flatter, and stick in the

Prog.
They are engendered of a hot and moist humor, which is de^cried, by noting the
patient his order, in the regiment of his body. As his meats being moist and
phlegmatic, joined with the use of nuttes, figs, chestnuttes, and fruits:
neglecting the head for combing, etc.

The hot and moist humor which is the cause of this disease must be taken
away, Cure. Diet.
both by diet and medicines. Let therefore the patientes meat be of good and
lawdable juice, his exercise moderate, his bath of salt water, and his clothes
be often changed: and generally observing, to keep his diet slender: the
medicines to purge out this cause, Med.
must be ordained according to the nature of the humors abounding, if the age
and other considerations be not repugnaunt. Then with convenient medicines: as
bitter, discutient, astringent and drying, draw forth and kill the worms

and so there is joined with the vlceration pain, much wat^ing and redness of
the eyes, Cur^.
etc.

Euacuate first the sharp and biting humor, by bloudletting, cupping,
ligature, frication, spare diet, and purging medicines, as in Ophthalmia: as
also by repellent medicines applied outwardly. If the ulcer be sanious, cleanse
it, but with medicines without biting, or moving of pain: such as syrupus
acetosus, ^^^l virgineum, sacharum candum, aloe lota, myrrha etc. If it be
hollow and lack flesh, incarne and glutinate the same cu^ Thutia praeparata,
collyrio albo sine opio, or collyrio de plumbo, either of these finely groune,
and dissolved in aquis rosarum, vel plan^aginis, vel candae equinae, vel in
lacte muliebri, vel lacte caprin^. If there be pain or inflammation, mitigate
and cure them as is said, in Ophthalmia.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the lachrimall or teari^ fistula.
THE cause hereof is a fell, sharp^ and nitrous humor^ gotten either to the
bone, or gathered in the circumference or sauft compass about the eye. Both
which you shall perceive by search and feeling: for there is callou^ hardness,
and toughnes in the bone (if it be ^oucht) like^ise some aposteme ever goes
before it, the matter is serous and glewish, and there is rednes in the eye.

A lachrimall fistule is hard to be cured, Prog.
for the neerens and sensibilitie of the eye. And that that is inueterate can
scarce be cured, because of the bone much corrupted. And if it be, yet shall
that eye be ever wat^ing, Calm. li. 3. c. 20.
because the flesh in the corner is wasted.

This humor would be spent out of the whole body, Cure.
or head, by blood letting (if nothing let) slender diet, and of good juice,
and purging medicines according to the nature of the humors. Also it would be
turned away from the place whether it flows, by bloudletting, cupping,
bynding and frications on the contrari^ parts. The rest of the cure, is by
medicines, thus to be performed: if it be sanious or filthy, cleanse and
mundifie it either by filling the cauitie, cum laungine rad. arundinis, and so
often used till it be perfecty mundified: or with a collirie ex thure,
sarcocolla, aloe, sanguine draconis, balaustia, antimonio, alumine, mixed in
equal parts, with putting to quarta^ parte^ flor. aeris. or ammoni^cu^
dissolved in aceto cu^ aerug. ras. or this liniment: Rec. aquae vitae, mellis
ros. col. ana,.j. myrrhae,.ij. fia^ linimentum. Wherewith annoint the place
morning and eueninig. If it be grown with callous hardness, waste it with
vng. aegiptiacum, or pull. mercurij or asphodeli. If the bone be defiled, apply
a cauterie, in quantity and form proportionable to it: in the mean time,
defending the eye, with lint, or flax wet in albumine oui, and thereupon
holding also a silver spo^e. Finally the hollownesse of the fistula must be
filled with flesh, and so after when it comes to be even cicatrized:
accordingly as is taught in the wounds of the eyes.

^rog.
Seeing it comes of the flowing in of sharp and putrified humors, it is very
hard to cure.

Order the patients diet so, Cure.
as his meats may be of good juice, and not sharp nor salt, his drink
small. And the quantity of either spare. Open the humerall vein, if the head
abound with blood, and set cups to the hinder part of the head, purge
universally, cum pillulis aureis, cochijs, sine quibus, etc. And after
perticulerly, with masticatories ex mastice and scammonio etc. Fortify also
the part affected, to wit, the head, that it be not so apt to receive
excrements, thitherto ascending: and this do by dryinge and repellent means,
such as these: oleum myrthinum, ol. rosaceum, puluis corallorum, santallorum,
rosarum rub. sicc. gallarum, acaciae, myrthi, masticis, mannae thuris, etc. Of
those may you make plasters, to apply all over the top of the head, being

CHAP. XX. Ulcers in the ears.
THese ulcers proceed of vicious humors, Causes and signs.
and are evident by their pain, putting forth of matter, etc.

First therefore provide for the taking away of those vi^ious humors, Cure.
by blood lettinge, cuppinge, ligatures and frications, etc. Thin dye^, and
purginge medicines, and that first universally, according to the nature of the
humors, and afterward particularly, by the mouth and nostrels. By the mouth
with this masticorie: Rec. theriacae veteris,.ij. staphidis agriae, pyrethri,

morninge before meat. Make also a nosepurge ex succ. anagallidis, mer^urialis,
maioranae, and melissae, ana, q.s. often times let the patient snuff thereof
into his nostrels. Now if the ulcer be filthy, apply thereto medicines that
may cleanse and dry, and first of a gentler sort: as, Rec. aquae decoct.
agrimoniae, and absynth. li.ss. vini albi, mellis ros. ana ij. instill thereof
warm. Or this: Rec. succi mali punici dulc. succi poligoni, succi virgae

ear. So may you do oleum ouorum, cum melle. Of a stronge^ sort (if need be)
you have vnguen^um AEgiptiacum dissolved. Or, Trochisci Andronij, dissolved in
vinegar. When the ulcer then is cleansed and pure, make your medicines such as
may both incarne, and yet mundifie withal: such as this trochiske and water
following: Rec. balaustiorum,.ij aluminis,.j. atramenti sutorij,.ij.

mitigate it with oleo ouorum, in mortario plumbeo diu agitato, until it become
of a swartish or leadie color, and then instill thereof into the ear.

CHAP. XXI. Ulcers in the breast.

that is the cause antecedent, institute such a diet, both as may^ be of spare
quantity, as also contrary thereto in quality. It shall therefore be
convenient for him to take him to rest, and to use such meat as is prescribed
in the wounds of the breast. His drink let be decoctu^ virgae pastoris cum
melle: or, aqua agrimoniae stillatitia. Empty also the body, by blood letting
and purging, due consideration had to all circumstances thereto belonginge.
Then, for the ulcer it self, if it pearce not into the breast, you may cure it,
after the manner of a simple ulcer. But if it pearce in, there is further care
to be had. In this case therefore if the orifice be strait, enlarge it, and
having rowme enough to come to your work, consider whether it be filthy and
purulent, or clean. If it be filthy, first practice to cleanse it, which you
may do, with this liniment: Recipe chalcanthi,.j. mellis rosati, ij. mis^e.
Or, make iniection cum mellicrato, or oenom^lite: else thus compounded: Recipe

To take away the antecedent cause, euacuate the vicious humor^ partly by
bloudletting, according to the body, and partly by medicines, according to
the nature of the offending humors. The ulcer is to be dealt withal being
considered in his case, as it is, of a courteous or malign kind. If it be not
malign, but of tractable condition, it must be dried, cleansed, incarned, and
conglutinated, as with some water, unguent, or powder following: as aqua

CHAP. XXIIII. Of virulent and corrosiue ulcers.
A Virulent ulcer is that, Def.
wherein virus, that is to say, a certain thin and liquid excrement, not
fretting, abounds.

A corrosiue ulcer is that, which by eating, and sometime making an escarre,
becomes greater and larger daily. And this for the most part, follows
Herpes, and itching pustules.

The cause is a choleric, Causes and signs.
sharp and adusted humor. The signs are manifest enough out of the definition.

For the auoydinge of the antecedent cause, Cure.
for which you must first labor, seek to euacuate the sharp inflowing
choleric humor, (by order of diet and medicines) both from his bowndes,
whence it comes, and also from the point, where it setleth. And first for his
order of life, let the scope of it be cooling and drying. And so it shall be
convenient, that the party have great quiet both in mind and body, that his
meat be of barley, or almond milk, chic^ kins, partriches, small birds,
etc. with these herbs: spinache, endive, suckerie, lettuse, etc. For drink,
barley water, or such other: and in all his diet, let the quantity be spare.
Open a veine^ if the body abound with blood, and age and strength be
answerable. Prepare and concoct the humor with some of these syrupes, given
with appropriate waters: oxysa^chara, syrupus acetosus, sir. violarum, sir. de

the place, with vnguentum de bolo armeno, etc. If the humor come thither as
drawn and sucked in^ by the part it self, make reuulsion by blood letting,
or cupping, with frications and ligatures, on the contrary part. All the
local medicines, applyable in this case, must be of property, cold and dry,
astringent and discutient: as well for the drying up, and spending of the
inherent humor, as for the beating back of the fluent. Of which nature are
these simples: plantago solanum, summitates rubi, consolida, f^li^ vlmi, and

But here some first apply puluerem Mercurij, to take away the corrosion and
malice of the vlcer^ letting it lie to a whole day, and applying aloft

CHAP. XXV. Of the filthy and putrified ulcer.
Def.
A Filthy and putrified ulcer, is that, which through his malicious nature,
putrifieth the member, shedding out from it, either viscositie, soft flesh: or
a stinking crust, from which vapoureth a filthy and carrennish fume.
Frandule^t ulcer.
Such an ulcer is also called fraudulent. But if it go forward in his malice,
and fall a creeping, it degenerateth into sphacelus. It comes commonly after
a Ca^buncle, or anthrax, or some abcesse, or wound evil handled.

Causes and signs.
The cause is, sanguine humor depraved, thick and boiling. The part affected is
manifest, and the signs of the ulcer are evident by the definition.

Prog.
If the malice of this vlcer^ grow walkeripe, that is, fall a creeping, it
turns to Sphacelus, and so to the death of the party.

Cure.
First, the sanguine humor, which is thick and boiling, and has gotten a
certain venimousnes and malignitie, is to be euacuated by bloudletting, diet,
and purging medicines, as is before set down in the cure of phlegmon, Carbuncle
and Gangraene. Then that in the part affected is to be cleansed, and done
away, by medicines, such as, farina hordei, fabarum, cicerum, orobi,
lupinorum, iris, apium, aristolochia, hypericum, centaurium minus, gentiana,
marrubium, mel. aqua mulsa, aqua marina, lixiuium, etc. Wash therefore the
filth away, with water and honey, or wine and honey, or with aqua marina: or a
lee made ex.iiij. cineris caulium, and corticis fabarum, cum aquae pluuiae
li.j. or, ex lixiuij.iiij. mellis.j. and pulueris praecipita^i.ij. Afterward
apply either some usual unguent or plaster: Call. li. 3. cap. 11.
as namely, unguent. de resina, vng. fuscum, apostolorum, de gummi, de
pompholyge cum puluer^ mercurij, AEgiptiacum, Empl. de gratia dei, Empl.

Now if the ulcer fall to putrefying wash it in oxycra^o or muria, and then
form a plaster to it, ex carnibus piscium sa^sorum, farina crobi,
aristolochi^ ^^nga, scylla, and mel. in vino coct. Or apply vnguentum
AEgyptiacum, which to a deep ulcer, you may use by way of iniection,
dissoluing the same in lixi^^^, vino and melle, or the aforesaid decoction.
Excellent also is Auicenes unguent thus compounded: Recipe tragacanthirub..j.

sort of mundificatiues are used, you apply some defend^nge medicines about
the borders of the ulcer, as vnguentu^ de bolo, and beds or stuphes wet in
oxycrato, for the avoiding of inflammation. But if the ulcer yet more and more,
eat upon the borders and parts adjoining to it, it is requisite then, to use
the medicines proper to the malign ulcer. And sometime incision, to take away
that which is putrified and corrupt. Else a cauterizing iron, or some sharp
medicine, such as ^rochiscus asphodeli, de arsenico: or this causticke
following, (which will mightily pearse in one hours space, and procure less
pain then arsenicum sublimatum.) Rec. calcis viuae, li.ij. cineris ilicis,

days mixte together: after^ boil them to the hardness of a stone, or a
sufficient thickness and dryethe: you may add also (if you list) saponis
mollis,.j and this is profitable, not only to the consuming of ^lesh, but of
fistulous hardness also.

Here likewise may you have use of the sublimate Water, set down in the
Chapter aforegoinge. or make a medicine in solid form, applyable on tents,
as follows: Recipe terebynthinae lotae,.ss. cerae albae,.ij. liquesiant
simul, deinde add sublimati,.j. move then til they be cold. Or, ^alm ibid.
Recipe sublimati.j sanguinis draconis,.ij. fiat puluis, which straw upon the
ulcer: or receive it with linte upon your probe, and therewith touch the
ulcer, which also you may do to a bleeding vein: for it is a causticke, and
astringent medicine. Many things also may be here in use, that are written
in the Chapter aforegoing. And if further proceeding be yet required, go on
to the cure of Gangraena, and Spacelus.

CHAP. XXVI. Of a deep and hollow banked ulcer.
Deep, cunniuaulted, or cauernous ulcers, Def.
are those, which having strait orifices outward, and large scope and
profunditie inward, make many turninges and fouldinges, out of sight: some
straight, some crooked: yet without hardness or callous growing.

They come commonly of apostemes not opened in dew time, Causes and Signs.
or wounds vnartificially handled. The reason is this, that matter which is
retained longer time, in a ripe aposteme then is meet, becomes sharp and
fretting, and so (at length) works corners and cauities to it self, which
are very hardly healed. For to the affected part, which now is become weak,
will all superfluous humors both of the next parts, and of the whole body,
flow, and by that means, the ulcer become hardly curable. The ulcers
hollownesse is discernable by diligent sounding the same, either with tents or
probes of silver or lead: or small stalks or roots of herbs, or wax candles:
else certain colored iniections.

The goodness, Prog.
and little quantity of sanies, or pus, with the vanishing of pain and
swelling, which first were present, show the hollownesse to fill with flesh
and be glutinated: or contrariwise.

Appoint a slender diet, according to the nature of the body, Cure.
and humors. And purging medicines after the like rate. If there be any
distemperature, phlegmon, Erysipelas, or pain, first remove them. For unless
the symptoms be first done away^ the ulcers cauitie cannot be filled up.
For it cannot be, that either the growing of flesh, or joining of cauities, or
inducing of cicatrices, cann^ be rightly performed, unless the subject flesh
comme first to his natural state and condition. And how these accidents may
be removed, you shall observe out of the curation of wounds. If the
hollownesse of the ulcer reach downwarde, and the orifice be above, either
make incision from the orifice to the bottom (which is best to do when the
hollow runs by the skin) or at least make a vent in the bottom, if it
be perilous to do otherwise. But the best is always, (if nothing gain
stand it) to dissect the hollownesse thoroughout, rather then to make incision
on the other side of the hollow. For so shall the ulcer be brought to healing
both easilyer and sooner. The cauitie being all laid open, by applying then,
fit medicines, on your lintes and plageates, so purge and dry the whole
hollownesse, that at the length, flesh may grow again, the cauitie be filled,
and the ulcer brought to perfect soundness: after the order set down in the
chap. of deep and hollow wounds. But if you make your incision on the other
side of the hollowenesse, suffer first some sufficient store of matter to
gather together in the bottom of the cauity, to the making of the skin both
thinner, and ^agging outward: as also for the eas^er co^uaying of a probe into
the bo^tom. Now let your probe be smooth, and anointed with some unctuous thing
having an eye in the hinder end, like a needle, to carry with it a ceton, made
of hemp, or some sle^der cloth, or ^auft band. After incisio^, appease the
pain that grows, and flux of blood, with the white of an eg, and such other
helps as serve to the suppressing of blo^di profusion. After this again, when
need requires, put in a fresh ceton, armed with some mundifying medicine:
which you shall the aptlier do, by tying, or stitching it to the old, when it
is plucked out. Otherwise, if neither the cauitie can commodiously be cut
forth, nor yet opened in the bottom: yet then have you cure for it, by
mundifying, incarnatiue, and glutinatiue medicines: thus, first mundifie it
with iniections, made ex oxymel. A mixture of wine and honey.
oenomelite, vino astringenti, aqua alluminosa, melle, lixiuio, aqua marina,
puluere mercurij, etc. or thus: R^. aquae plantaginis, aquae peculi ros. aquae

postea add terebynthinae, ol. veteris, ana,.iij. cerae, q.s. fiat ceratum.
There may be applied in this case, hollow tents of lead, with boulsters,
and an expressing kind of ligature, a piece of sponge being laid in the
orifice: by which means, the matter being partly pressed and partly sucked
forth, the ulcer may be kept dryer. In the mean time, it shall not be
amiss, to fortify the parts round about^ with some medicin, partly repellent
and partly discutient: as this following decoction. Rs. calamenthi, origani,

in wine to that purpose.

CHAP. XXVII. Of a fistula.
A fistula is a narrow, Def.
long, and callous grown cauitie, little paynefull, and for the most part,
following apostemes vnartificially handled.

It comes of evil humors, especially phlegmatic and melancholic, Causes
and Signs.
etc. What part is taken therewith, by sight and search, it is easily
discovered. Signs are^ callous, growinges, horrible virulencie, little pain,
etc.

A fistula if it have hurt some bone, Prog.
cartilage, sinewe, or muscles: or if it occupy a joint: or have pierced to
the bleddar, lunges, matrice: or to the great veins or arteries: or to the
empty spaced parts, such as the throat, stomache, or breast, it is
pernicious. And those are always perilous also, that tend to the guts. A
fistula in the fundament, lurking without an orifice, or that has manifold
turnings, or ends in the bone, is hardly healed. A fistula manifold wise
creeping, with many turning corners and crooked windinges, is cured only by the
hand. If a fistula pearce deeper, then that a collirie can be sent into it,
it is curable only by handie operation.

First the cause of the fistula, Cure.
to wit, hurtful humors hindering the healing of it, are to be diminished and
taken away, partly by diet, partly by preparing and purging medicines,
according to the nature of the humors. Secondly the inner perts must be
strengthened as by these potio^s, devised for that purpose: 1. Recipe
agrimoniae parts iij. plantag. parts, ij. fol. oliuae, part^ j. scindantur
minutim and contundantur: postea in vino albo coqua^tur, and fiat colatura,
whereof let the patient take.j. ss. every morning, 2. Recipe of mundae regalis
(which with Dioscorides, is filix mas) scrophula^iae ana, part. j. agrimoniae,
centaurij minoris, ana, parts ij. aristolochiae, gentianae, ana, part. ss.
rad. filicis part. j. philipendulae part. ij. coquantur in vin^ albo, addendo
sacchari, q.s. And give of that decoction every morning,.j. ss. you may add
Guaiacum also to the same decoction, and after the callus of the fistula is
taken away, it shall avail to use Guaiacum sodden in wine or water, having
regard to the patients strength, and humors and even as you covet to make it
more or less drying. Thirdly the fistula it self is to be dealt withal: and
first if it be strait and narrow orificed, it must be enlarged, with a tent of
gentian, or the trochises de minio, or ex radice brioniae. or dracunculi^ or a
sponge thus prepared: Recipe cerae, resinae ana,.j. sublimati,.j. liquescat
cera cum resina, postea add sublimatum, soake your sponge in that mixture, and
by and by pluck it out, least it burn, then diligently press it. After this,
root out the callousnesse, either by medicines, or handie operation. Simple
medicines to that end are, auripigmentum rubrum, sublimatum, aqua sublimata,
arsenicum, spondilij radix, veratrum nigrum, elaterium, laserpi^ij succus etc.
compounde are, troachis^i asphodeli^ trochis. de arsenico, aqua alchymistarum,
or this iniection: Recipe vng. aegyptiaci.ss. sublimati, ^ss. arsenici,.j.
lixiuij..j. aquae rosarum,.ij. aquae plantag..iiij. coquantur ad tertias: make
therewith iniection three days: and ever after iniection, cloase up the
orifice with wax, or bombast, that the same abiding within, may work the
better, and consume the fistula. The handie operation to be performed in this
case, is either incision only, without cauterie, or else incision and cauterie
together. The incision done alone, is to be followed all along the hollow,
to the very botome of the fistula: after which you must take out the callous,
either with your nails, or instruments, so as the place, may be left pure
and clean from all filthiness and quick and perfect flesh every where
appear: and this is the true cure of the fistula: which must be done by and by
in the beginning, if nothing let. Incision and cauterie together is thus to be
done, if nerves or arteries forbid not. First try, whether the fistula run
right forward, or crooked, by searching with a probe o^ wax candle: if you
find it lie shallowe, and narrow: make it more evident, with your probe
houlding in it, and in good order, cut it along with your incision knife. If
there be many turninges or windinges, those prosecute in like sort, with
probe and kniffe. Now when you are come to the end of the fistula, fill all
the ulcer, so, with tents, or lintes, dipte in the white of an egg, as the
lips of it may be kept asunder for going together again. The day
following, burn the place, either with hot iron, or causticke: to wit, cum
puluere asphodelorum, vel arsenico, vel hydrar^yro, or other such like. But if
the fistula lie not shallowe, but tends just inwardes, when you have made,
first, your incision, as deep as can be, and as is lawefull to go, if it be
possible take away the callousnesse round about, as was said even now: and
if any of it be left behind, waste it afterward with some burninge medicine.
If much callous have remained, and will not give place to such medicines, burn
it with hot yrons. Observing always, by the way, to lay aloft, and round
about the place, things that may cool and beat back. And thus the fistula
being burned, and dried, as it ought, must be attended the first days
following, with some mitigatorie medicine: as oleo cum oui luteo mixto. After
that, applying those things, that may loose the cruste: such as butter or
other like. When callus is gone, mundifie the ulcer with putting in of aqua
mulsa, or cum decoctione erui cum melle: then applying this unguent: Rs.

CHAP. XXVIII. Cancer exulcerate.
A Cancer exulcerate is a round ulcer, Def.
hor^ible, stinking, with lips both thick and harde^ knott^e, turned inward,
strouting upward, and hollow banked in color blackishe and obscure, with
veins in the circuit of the ulcer, full of melancholy blood.

It comes of melancholicke humors, Causes and signs.
and of wounds or ulcers evil handled. Signs are, pain, hardness,
swelling: the ulcer as it were gnawed, v^euen^ filthy, swart color, and
stinking. The matter of it thin, watrish, black or yellowe, evil sauouring.

A cancer that is in the veins, Prog.
synewes and bones, is hardly cured. An aged cancer, and such as has got a
habit in the member, is incurable. So also is a cancer hidden in the interior
parts.

First take away the melancholicke humor, Cure.
by diet, bloudletting, and purging, like as is before set down, in the hidden,
or not exvlterate cancer. Then for the cancer it self, if it be external,
and superficially rooted, fetch it out, root and all, with instruments or
causticke medicines: to wit, cut it wholly away, with an incision kniffe,
and press the thick blood, out of all the veins near to it, that it may
flow forth. After again join the lips of the ulcer, and go forward to cure
it as another ulcer. Some consume it with a cautery. And others, after the
cutting and pressing out the blood, apply also a cauterie, with causticke
medicines it may be done: as cum arsenico sublimato. But then the places
about it, must be defended, with an unguent de bolo, for avoiding inflammation.
After procure the casting of the escar: and so proceed in the cure, as in
other ulcers. Now if the cancer vlcerate, be in some inner part, deeply
rooted, and near a principal part, so as it cannot be cured, yet then at the
least, we may use means to hinder his increase: as letting blood, if nothing
hinder, and using such a diet as may eng^nder good blood: to wit, barley
cream, whaye, birds flesh, stone fishes, mallows, arrage, beetes,
cowcumbers, a little wine and that watered. But sharp meats, much filling^
etc. hurt. Let his purging medicines be such, as in the exulcerate cancer. His
local medicines drying but without all biting: such as, succu^ ^olani, or
ace^osae, aqua s^lani, acetosae, plantaginis, plumbum, antimonium, ^l^um

There are some more particular ulcers, which might here be handled, which I
would also have done by way of supplye, as in other places, save that my
book of ulcers, already ex^ant, can well deliver ^ee of so much labor, for
that point.

The fourth book entreating of fractures and dislocations.
CHAP. I. Of fr^ctures.
A Fracture is diui^ion Def.
or breaking of a bone, by means of some outward violence, done unto the
part.

Causes are, Causes and signs.
things of weight falling on the place, or falling of the party from high, and
such other ways, as the patient can best declare unto you. Whether the
fracture be overthwart or longwayes, you shall thus discern. If it be
overthwart, the parts of the bone in feeling, do seem in that place,
several, and disioynde: the figu^e of the member is unequal. The part is full
of pain when it is touched: and when the member is moved and diuersely
handeled, the bones make a noise and crackling. If it be longwayes: the parts
in handling, is to be perceived more then naturallye thick, with pain, and
unevenness, the other signs being awa^e.

Prog.
The arm, and cubitte bones: as also the thighs, legs, and finger bones, are
not daungero^^: if they be broken in their midst. But the nearer the fracture
is to the head (be it upper or nether) of the bone, so much the worse is it
judged. If a ribbe be wholly brooken, the case is hard. A fracture in the
nosethrilles is the worse, when the breach of the bone, or gristell, is
accompanied with a wound in the skin. In a fracture of the skull these
things foretell of evil: to wit, the membran immovable, black, swart, or
otherwise evil colored, loss of the wits, sharp vomitte, resolution or
else distention of the nerves: blackish flesh, and stiffenesse of the jaws
and neck. A simple transuerse fracture is most tolerable. A s^ope fracture
with loose fragmentes, is worse: but a sharp pointed worst of all. A fracture
with pain, or inflammation, or contusion of the flesh, is evil: for that it
cannot be restored, till those accidents be first removed. And if a wound be
in the flesh also, the case is evil: specially if it be in the muscles of the
thigh or sholder bone. Agglutinatio^ of bones, in a declining age, choleric
persons, and recovering health, is most difficult: but in decrepitte and very
aged ones, im^ossible. Moreover, a fracture the elder it is, so much the worse
it is. The skul asks xxx. days to be joined in. the arm and leg (if they
be rightly handled) about xl. the cubitte is knitte for the most part, in xxx.
days. The bone of the nose broken, joins in viij. or ten days space. A
ribbe souldreth in xxj. days. The iawe, and cannell bone, between xiiij. and
xxj. days. The shoulder bone humerus, and the thighs, between xxvij. and xl.
days.

Cure.
Your patient being placed, according as his case requires, appoint two
ministers to apply their hands to the fracture, one above, another beneath
it, which may by pulling the member, one upward, another downewarde, or the
one to the right hand, the other to the left ward: in just order, join
again the broken parts of the bone, and fit them to their natural fashion
and placing. If you stand in need of more force, or ^tronger stretching,
prepare large tyals of strong linen, which being fastened above and beneath
the ^racture, with two assistantes, one drawing one way, another another way,
pull out the member as much as you need: taking heed that you make not over
violent extension in the member, specially in dryer bodies, lest vehement
pain, fevers, conuulsion and resolutions be procured. Beware also, that in
the stretchinge of the member, none of the outstrouting bones be broken, which
would make ^he cure more difficult to perform. when the member therefore is
somewhat more then naturally stretched out, apply your hands then to the
fracture, and couch the bones in their places again: after let those that
stretch the member let go their hands by little and little, till the member be
again returned to his length. And thus you shall know whether the bones be
right: if the pain do slack, and the sense of pricking vanish. Hippocrates in
his book of fractures, teaches another kind of setting, by the instrument
called glossocomium: which is done, like as, by the sentence of a judge,
tormenters stretch upon the rack, suspected persons: notwithstanding that this
other wai is both more easy and familier. After now the bones are couched in
their places again, let your study be, so to retain and keep them. Anoint
therefor all the member cum ol. rosaceo warm, or ol. myrthino or mastichino,
sprinckling thereupo^ ex puluere mas^icis. After, Rec. boli armeni, terrae
sigilla^^, farin^ v^latilis, ana parts aequales, excipiantur alhuminibus
^uorum, and upon thin stupes, orderly platted, and wette in water and
viniger and wrounge out, apply it: layi^g again aloft on them, a cloth wette
in water and viniger: this done, with a sauft firm roll, wonde up at both
ends, and wet in water and viniger. fetch iij. or iiij. turns about the
fracture: after that, dispose one end upward, and the other downewarde, but
reducing the lower end, to the upper part again. And for that cause, provide
in the beginning, that, that end of the roll, that goes downewardes, be so
much longer the^ the other. As for the length and breadth of the roll, that is
always to be ordained proportionable to the greatness of the fracture and
member. In the mean time, look that your binding be nether to slack, nor to
strait. For the one does no good, to the retayning of the bones in their
places, the other causes pain and infla^mation prohibiteth nourishment and
vital spirit to be communicated to the member and hinders the euaporation of
excrements^ yet most strait of all must the ligature be in the place of the
fractur: which to be so, you shall, pertly by your own handing^ partly by the
perties feeling, understand. After rolling, apply also your splentes (although
Hippocrates and other auntients apply not the^ til the 7. day) not in such sort
as that they may constrain or bind the part (for so they should either stir up,
or maintain pain and swelling in the part:) but only as they may contain the
me^e position of the member, and underset the bones on each side, restored to
their places. In the beginning therefore apply splents, but not too straightly,
til the time that fear of pain and inflammation be past: and then tie the^
straiter. see your splents be smooth and eue^ plained of thin woode^ or
pastbord, or hid^ lether. Some in steed of splentes, use barks of trees^ but
they are not sufficient stablishme^t for the bones. if for the inequality of
the member, splents cannot be applied, the hollow disuantaged places must be
filled up, with beds, and boulstring clothes for that purpose: and so the
splents being lapt in woll or flax, must be bound about the fracture, one a
finger distance from another, so, as they may not slip their places^ shunning
to touch a joint with them, and specially the inner bowing of it. Moreover,
when you have bound up the member, in order, provide for the fit placing of
it: which is that, that is most void of pain, and answerable to the natural
and accustomed figure, and wherein the patient may longest endure it. Galen
calls that the rightest figure, which has the veins, arteries and muscles
rightest. The cornered figure is rightest to the arm. Therefore to the
conservation of the rolled member, some few (most closely) straw in a linen
cloth, and making thereof as it were a bed, do place and tie the member
therein. Others make a case fit For it, after the same manner. If thus the^ it
go forward, so as neither pain, inflammation, ytching, ulcer, nor other
symptom molest, and the fracture it self is rightly restored, then ought both
the bindinges and splents ^o abide until the xv. day: fomenting the member
mean while, round about it, cum ol. myrtino, and mastichino. Profitable also
is it, if you apply (especially the first days) a defensive to the upper part
of the member. Then after ^x. days, loose the bindings: foment the part, cum
vino decoctionis absynthij and rosarum, cum sale, and again, for other seven
days, use the same medicines as before. After which time also, foment the place
as is now said, but apply Emplastrum oxycroceum upon it. By these means,
shall nature join again the broken bones (like as sometime also without
medicines) which she does by engendring a callous substance, Callus.
betwixt the broken parts, whereby they a^e glewed together again. The same
callous arises from the nourishment of the bone, and is therefore better
helped by diet fitt^ for that purpose. Let the patient therefore use meats of
good juice, and which can nourish much, (unless there be a wound) and
which may also engender thick and cleaving iuyces: for such are fit to make
this soulder. And such are these, to wit, ryce, wheat, the extremes and
intrelles of beasts, chiefly of the kidde, and wether. In the beginning let
his diet be but slender, absteyning from wine and flesh, till the tenth day, at
which time callus begins to engender. When a fracture is in the lower parts
of the body, seldom move the belli^, neither with clisters, nor purging
medicines, but sometime open a vain to stay the defluxion. Thus much of a
simple fracture: now if it be complicate, as with contusion or wound, then
must you also observe to do further, then hitherto has been said. As if there
be a contusion withal, your ligature shall not be as aforesaid, but as
Hippochrates counsels; your roll must run from either side of the
contusion, slopewise along, after the fashion of the Greek letter (...), that
the contused place may remain uncovered, so as you may always come to dress
it, not vnrowling the member. After the same manner shall you do, if there be
a wound: providing first, if there be any loose bones, that prick, to take
them forth in the beginning.

Hippochr. cures a fracture with a wound, the same way, as that without a
wound, save that he makes his bynding loser, in the place of the wound, then
if there were none. He uses also more rowlers, because he rowleth looselier.
Also he comes not so soon to the use of his splents, and appoints a
slenderer diet. Now if any symptom arise, or the fracture proceed not
rightlye, Hippochr. wills to vnrowle the member every ^^irde day, and so to
deal with the symptom. Symptoms.
The symptoms which commonly cumber are these: vnpro^ortionable growth of
Calius, pain, inflammation, ytchinge, Gangraene, and uncomely form of the
member. The Callus is unproportionable, if it either want, or abound. If it
grow too skarcely therefore, use moderate perfusion of warm water, to the
place, as also frications, and Emplastrum ex pice: for these things draw
nowrishment to the affected part. Again, medicines that have digerent and
spending faculty, do diminish a new ouergreat grown Callus: as does lamina
plumbe^, strait bound to the place, also immoderat frication, or done with
oleo, sale, ac nitro, or much fomentation with warm water, and vomiting, with
a thin diet. If there be pain, or inflammation, vnrowle the member, (if it
be rolled) speedely. and apply woole with oil and viniger: or other such
convenient helps, to the payned and inflammed part. And neither shall you
make any rolling to the member, nor yet apply splentes, (till the inflammation
be removed) save only, so far, as they may stay the member, and keep on
the medicines applied: that is, very loosely. Some counsel liberal
fomentation with warm water, whilst the inflammation endures, and a little
use of it, after it is gone: but inflammation and pain once banished, then
rolling and splenting as afore^ayde, are to be used. If there by noisome
ytching, or pustules, foment the place cum aqua, aceto and sale, and use to it
vng. album, diapompholygos, populeon or such other, If through contusion, or
any such matter, some danger of a gangraene be threatened, scarifie the part
affected. And if the gangraene, or other creeping putrefaction have taken place
meet with it, with such engines, as are set down against such enemies in
other places of this book. Finally, if after the fracture set, and the place
grown, the member show awrie, and lose his natural figure: then must you go
back again, breaking first the callus and after, restore the member aptly, in
form aforesaid: which to do, you must first make sauft the callus, by such
mollifying medicines as follow: some being plasters, some fomentations, some
vnguentes: Rec. fol. cicutae m.iiij. fiat decoctio: herewith foment the part,
then stamp the leaves with axnugi^ fuillae or gallinae, and lay it upon as a
plaster, after fomenting: for this sauftneth callus meruelouslye, so, as that
within ix. days it may easily be broken, and the member be fit to set
again. In the end, this sparadrap following is much auayling. Rec. thuris,

CHAP. II. Of luxations.
A Luxation is the slippinge of a ionyt forth of his native positio^, De^.
and proper lodging, into another strange and unwonted feate, whereby
voluntary moouinge is hindered. The Greeks call it Exarthrenia. Causes and
signs.
It has causes both inward and outward: The outward are, fallen, strokes,
exten^ion, wrenchinge, wrong writhinge, etc. to be understood by the
patients speech. Inward causes are, mucous, and pituitous humors. That the
joint is displaced, these are ^ignes: to wit, Tumor in that part, where the
bone lies, that is leapt out, and a pit or cauitie in the place, from which
it is departed. Also, pain and difficulty, or privation of moouinge in that
member.

A luxation, Prog.
wherein the borders of the bones, that is, the brinks of the cauities are
broken, is judged worst. If the head slip out toward the hinder part, it
cannot be again compelled into the place, but by and by brings death. Of
bones that are moved from their places, some slip out, and are reposed again
^a^^ier, others more hardly. The knee, as it easily slippeth out, so, with no
great ado^, is it to be driven to his place again. Luxatio^ of the fingers
make no great business. The cubitte, as it seldom and hardly slippeth out,
so, if it be out it causes much trouble. The shoulder contrariwise is neither
hard to vnioynt, specially in lean persons, nor yet to bring again into his
place. The ^awe bone, shoulder blade, os tali, the heel bone, the hand, and
plant o^ middle of the foot, do commonly knitte again in xiiij. or xxi.
days. The hippe in 50. days, and the foot it self in 60. If rest be given.
Whosoever has his hippe vn^oynted, through daily pain wherewith he is there
molested, his leg after wastes, and he becomes lame, if he be not cured.
To what luxations soever, inflam^mation, or wound, or great and sharp pain
happens, these, besides that they are very hard to be cured, are also full of
danger. It is an evident sign of the coming of the bone again into his
natural place, if it made a crack, or noise when it returned to his seat
again: and by and by the figure and conformation of it, be in ^ight and
handling, the same it was, or like the same member on the other side. All old
luxations, and which ^y time are callous grown, do ei^^er very hardly, or
never receive ^^te. Those parts which in child^ood are displaced, and not set
again ^rowe less then the others.

The bone that is displaced, Cure.
must ^e stretched forth, and then by force ^^mpelled again, from the place
^hetherto it is gone, contrariwise to ^^s proper seat, whence he is slipped.
^ut there is not one and the same reason of extending all the parts: but
^iuers and sundry, according to the nature of the luxated part, and ac^ording
to the disposition, situation, and knitting of the bones, tendons, and ^erues^
For sometime it is don with ^he hande^ sometime not without ^andes or tialls (as
is said in fra^ures) and sometime we are driven ^o do it by engines^ for
that pur^ose, such as glossocomium. Thus when that joint is placed again,
study so ^o keep it: strengthening and confirming the member, with annoyntinge
it, ex ol. rosaceo, myr^ino, or, mastichino, and after, applying a linen cloth
steeped in rosaceo^ next that light stuphes and clothes, ouerspread cum oui
candido, and some powder of astringent things. Las^ of al, use your rowles, wet
in water and viniger, of breadth and length according to the part you have i^
hand. Further you shall apply splent^, of some stiff leather, or paste bo^de:
so yet, as the binding may not be to strait: least pain and inflammation be
thereby caused. All which once done^ in certain order, and manner, and the
member duly placed, leave it so, till the seventh or tenth day, unless some
symptom arise. When you come the second time, to dress your patient, foment
the member with warm^ water, both to swage pain, (if any^ be) and to
euaporate, or discuss su^ perfluitie^ in the affected pa^^^^. That done, cloth
the member aga^^^, with a plaster ex puluere astringen^e, and ou^rum albumibus:
and bind it harder^ A luxation sometime is complicat^^^ with a wound,
Luxation complicate.
or a fracture: if it be^ with a wound, it requires great wisdom and
diligence in the cu^^ of it: for that sometime while the bones are placed,
great peril, nay death it self is inferred. For when as the nerves and
muscles thereabout lying, are by stretching easily enflamed, it follows
likewise that grievous dolor, great conuulsions, and sharp fevers must easily
ensue, especially in the great joints. For the nearer that the luxated joint
with a wound, is to the principal members, the greater fear is it, of the
coming of such accidents. Therefore according to Hippochrates judgment, no
joints can be safely set again, beside the hands, feet and fingers: in
which also, he warns of wise proceeding, and that nothing be done headely or
rashly. Therefore, to be short, the joints luxated, must by and by, in the
beginning (while the part is void of inflamatio^) be placed, but a joint
displaced with a wound also, must be assayed to be set, by a mean intension,
or stretching, because it cannot suffer much stretching, without danger. If it
succeed aright, use diligence, that no inflammation arise. But if there grow
inflammation, conuulsion, or other such, after the joint is placed, displace the
same again, if it may be done without violence, and if we fear such a
hazard or peril (because peradventure the joint inflamed, will no^, without
force, be driven from his place again. It shall be better, if (in the
beginning, in such cases of the great joints, as the thighs and shoulders)
you leave of, and defer the placing of them. Afterward, when the
inflammation is ceased, (which is commonly the seventh, or ninth day after)
using some preface to the patients frinds, of the danger that is like to
follow such reposition, as also on the other side, that lamenesse and
weakness necessarily follow, if it be not set: endeavor safely, and without
violence, to drive the bone into his place again. As for the wound, deal
with it according as is taught before in the fracture with a wound. Also
observe that every displaced member, with a wound. If it be not set again,
must so be placed, as may be most to the patients ease. Above all, see that it
be not moved, nor hang downwarde. If there be a fracture with the luxation,
yet without a wound, the member then is to be extended, according to the
common manner, and so with the hands to be fashioned into his place, according
as is taught in simple fractures before. But if there be a wound also, a
convenient cure thereof, is to be fetched from the instructions already given,
for the handling of fractures and luxations complicate with wounds. And to
speak in a word: if a luxation happen with a fracture, the luxation (if it
may be) first, the fracture next is to be restored. If that cannot be, then
compass the cure of the fracture first, and after his Callus is grown firm,
undertake the luxation. Now concerning accidents: Acciden^
If inflammation grow, prevent or stay it, by means spoken of in the cure of
Phlegmone, and other places Pain you may mitigate by applying lana succida ex
hydraeleo calido, and ace^i momento. If there be any callous hardness, by
continuance of time, gathered, between the luxated bones, foment the place cum
decocto altheae, maluae^ and other mollifying medicines: then anoint it with
unguent. dealtheae: After lay upon a plaster of Diachylon magnum, or else in
steed thereof, lana succida in ma^ilagine qua piame molliente delibuta. To the
same end also, cortex radicis maluauisci decocted in water, and stamped cum
axungia, vel anserino pingui to the fourm of a cataplasme, is reckoned
effectual. Thus then, the parts within being sufficiently sauftened, give the
luxated bone his ^eat again.
