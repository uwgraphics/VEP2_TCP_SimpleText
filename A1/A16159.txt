A free admonition without any fees / To warn the Papists to beware of three
trees.
IF that you be not past all grace,
O Papystes hear me speak,
Let reason rule, and truth take place,
Crase you from that you seek.
Can you God or his word deface?
Can you the truth wythstand?
Can you our noble Queen displace,
And yet live in England?
Take heed beware the Devil is a knave
He will you sure begile:
Incruelty he would you have
To scrue him here awhile.
With lying and hipocrisy,
His kingdom to maintain:
Contemning truth and equity,
This is his subtle train.
Let cursed Cain example be,
That slew Abel his brother:
Whom neither God with Majesty,
Could move to leave his murder
Nor yet the godly life of him,
That gave him none offense,
Till he had heaped up his sin,
In practesyng his pretense.
Let Core and Dathan come from hell
Where now they do remain,
That they their minds at length maitel
Wherefore they there remain.
Namely, for that they did rebel,
And would not be persuaded,
But would be Lords in Israel,
Till hell had them devoured.
What could make Absalon meek and tame
And to desist from rage?
His father David's worthy fame,
Or yet his counsel sage?
No, no, these things will not preuail
With him that fears not God,
The force of doctrine there does fail,
Till God strike with his rod.
And as the Devil in these did rage,
To work his wicked will,
That nothing could their furye swage
Till they did it fuifyl.
So that the law of God and Man,
They sought to overthrow,
Even so of late I truly can
The like unto you show.
When King Edward of worthy fame
Had Antichrist put down,
And to the glory of Gods name,
Had placed truth in her room:
The denshire dolts like Rebels rank,
In rusty armor ranged,
But hanged were some, their cario^s sta^ck,
The world was quickly changed.
And then did Ket the tanner stout
In Norffolke play his part,
Assemblyng such his Rebels rout,
That Innocents might smart.
But hanged he was, this was his end,
And so end all the sort,
That Rebels are, and will not mend,
A rope be their comfort.
Such blessings as the Nortons had,
And such as Felton found,
God send them all that are so bad
With heels to bless the ground.
If that you like not for to have,
This blessyng in a rope,
Leave of you Rebels for to rave
And curse your Dad the Pope.
Which makes you often such Crows to pull
Then leaves you in the mire,
In sending you to such a Bull,
This is but simple hire.
Behold the end of this attempt
That last here was begun,
Lo God your doing does prevent,
The Rebels race to run.
Since God by grace does guide his flock
That none can them anoy,
If you be grafted in this stock,
He will you not destroy.
Fear God, flee syn, the truth embrace,
And seek your Prince to please,
Obey the laws and call for grace,
So shall you live at peace.
God save our Queen Elizabeth. quod G. B.
