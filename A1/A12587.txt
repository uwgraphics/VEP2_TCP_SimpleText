The reedifying of Salomons Temple / and the Laborers thereof.
WHen that the Cock began to crow
in February last
It was nere dai I knew right well
the birds they song so fast
For they recorded plesauntly
when they did understand
That winters blastes began to swage
and Vere was even at hand
And when the Parker hard this Cock
eftsone he began to stere
And up he start and gate him forth
to view and se the dear,
And when he came he se the dear
where they were on the launde
At whom the dear were not amasde
but still they stood and faunde.
For well they wist this Parker came
to do his wonted feate,
And or he went from them again
in deed he gave them meat.
Which they had sought and could not find
wherefore they looked thyn,
As though they had been chaste with dogs
that lately had rusht in.
As soon as he was gone from them
a Scory scourde the cost,
To fray the bandogges from the Dear
for fear they should be lost.
Which long had made such spoil of them
as like has not ben seen,
At every course a leyshe or two
as we full often have seen.
This Scory scoured all the park
he sercht it round about.
To fortify the walls thereof
to keep the bandogs out
When he had take the view thereof,
and saw the park so scalde.
He made his suit unto the Queen
to have it all new palde.
And after him there did succeed
a man of ancient years.
Which did renew the former suit
unto the noble Peers.
Whose judgment is profounde and deep
as all the learned say.
And he affyrmde and proved it both
our faith was in decay.
Which is the most assured wall
that may or can be bylte,
Which wall has been battred at
that it was almost spylte,
And if this wall be not repayrde
but fall still in decay
The bandogs will break in again
and drive the dear away.
Thus has this ancient whithed proved
with arguments most strong,
That if this wall be not repayrde
the park cannot stand long.
Wherefore the buylders of this wall
that have take it in hand
Have sharpened all their tools right well
to have this buildinge stand.
A Byll also sharped his edge
to cut the brambles down
And to destroy the wicked wedes
that were in hye renoume.
Thus all these builders work righe well
for they have begone the frame,
And all that se their workmanship
do much commend the same.
They work it artificiallye
as men expert and wise.
For why they build upon the rock
and not upon the yse.
Who has not seen, who has not hard
the doings of these men,
What pains they take incessantlye
to build this wall again,
To keep the young fawnes from the fox
and from the wolves and dogs.
Lest that the park be soylde again
with swyne and fylthy hogs.
Mark well ye grist that grind all ground
and ye shall understand,
That he is able well to buyld
the thing he takes in hand.
For he has newly beat his quernes,
wherefore it may be thought,
That he intendes to grind the grist
that we full long have sought,
But when the mighty Sampson came
that long had been away.
He musled up the bandogges mouths
that the had naught to say.
So that their fury is well cooled
through Sampsons force and might
For though they grin and look awrye
they have no power to byte,
For now the dear go quietlye
within the pale and park,
And are nothing afraid to here
the bandogs how they bark,
There kepers now ar come again
that long have been away,
Wherefore the poor and simple Dear,
are joyful of this day,
For when the Horn was heard of the^
which sounded like a bell,
The Dear that knew the same before
did like it weary well.
He blew his measures in such sort
so truly and so trymme
That all that hard the sound thereof
had much delight in him,
Besides all these yet are there mo,
whose diligence and pain,
Do crave of us etarnall praise
that live and do remain,
Lever and Sands, for so they hight
whose godly hearts and will
Are wholly bent unto the truth
and to confute the ill,
So are these two that yet remain,
as it has well been seen,
How learnedly they speak their minds
before our noble Queen.
Pedder and Wyntrel, these are they
whose memory and fame
Shall Be revived, when they are dead
their acts deserve the same,
For these and for the rest of them
let us give thanks to God,
whose mercy toward us is such,
that he has broke the rod,
O Lord be hold thy laborers
and now put to thy hand,
To build thy holy Temple up
that it may ever stand.
Drive out the idle men thereof
ye drive them clean away
Which long have sought the spoil of it
to bring it to decay.
To whom let us left up our hearts
at morrow and at even,
That it will please him to preserve
Elisabeth our queen,
Long to endure amongst us here
and to possess her place,
And afterward to Joy with him
when she has run her race.
Finis
God save the queen,
Imprinted at London, for Wyllyam Pickering dwellind at Saint Magnus Corner.
