Jmprinted at London by Thomas Cast* 1576.

A Brief description of the antiquity of diverse famous cities in Europe. The
vvayes and most used passages, from one notable city to another, in Germany,
Bohemia, Hungaria, Polonia, Lyttaw, and the low countries, with Italy France,
England, Spain, and Portingale. The value of the coin used in sundry Regions.
Also the principal Fayres and Marketts. With the variety of Miles.
TO THE RIGHT worshipful, Sir Thomas Greasham Knight. R. Rowlands wishes
continual increase of renoumed worship and Virtue.
AFTER that I (Right worshipful) had perused this small Pamflet, conteyninge
a brief collection of the most vseall and accustomable ways, leadinge from
the one notable City in Europe, to an other: being written with no small
labor and industry, and not without great cause very necessarily published in
the high Almaine tongue, and the like also to be seen in the French, and
Italian. I thought it a thing very discourteous, and worthy of reproof, to
vvithhould so needful a commodity any longer from our voulgare spech,
whereby I was the more imboldened to the finishing thereof, at such times as I
might best atte^d upon the same. I have moreover, set down the antiquity of
many cities worthy of memory, and the founders of their ancient monuments,
the which I have diligently collected out of sundry approved aucthors. It
rests now that I therein most humbly crave your good worships furtheraunce,
(as of one most worthy, for your great experience and travails, into forreyne
Realms, in the Princes vvaighty affairs, as it is not unknown,) so that
thereby it might the better, under your protection, pass forth into the hands
of many. And although (right worshipful) this brief collection, does contain
no pleasant history, nor delightful new devised matter, yet doubtless a thing
of necessity to be desired, especially of all such Gentlemen as are adicted
to travail, which hitherto have vvanted the same: beside Merchants, or
Factors, in forreyne countries, dispersed as their trafique requires. But to
be brief, I cease further to rehearse perticulerly the commodities thereof.
Desiring your worship to take in good part, the first fruits of my labors,
trusting hereafter (if God lend me good success) to impart unto your worship,
some further matter of more delight or pleasure in the reading thereof. And
thus I desire almighty God to preserve you, with your verteous Lady, in
health and prosperous felicity.

Your worshippes most bounden to command, Richard Rowlands.

A godly prayer, very needful to be used and said, before any Journey be
taken in hand.
O Lord Jesus Christ, with thy almighty everlasting and heavenly Father, in
unity with the holy Ghost, very trwe and euerliuinge God, as thou did
lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, into the land of
Promise, through the unfrequented Wilderness, in great safety, in the day
time by a Cloud, and in the dark night by a Fiery Pillar: Even thou O Lord,
which dyddest guide the Wise men from the rising of the Sun unto Bethlem, and
home again into their own country by a Star, preseruinge them from all
hurtes and dangers. So likewise, O heavenly Father, I most humbly desire thee,
that in this my Journey, thou will be my guide and protector, that I may
accomplish and bring this my way to an end, in health, and gladness: Preserve
and keep me from all perils of Soul and body, so that by thy fatherly
protection, I may overcome all perils and dangers, through Jesus Christ thine
only well-beloved son our Lord and Savior. Amen.

Here follows the variety of miles.
GEntle Reader, when thou shall find in this Book Italian Miles, then may
thou know, that. 5. Italian Miles contain one German Mile.

When thou fyndest French Miles, then three French Miles do contain one
Germayne Mile.

If thou fyndest Spanish Miles, they are equal in length unto Germayne Miles.

If thou fyndest English Miles, then do. 5. English Miles make two Germayne
Miles.

If thou shall see Hungarian Miles, then account two Hungarian Miles for three
Germayne Miles.

If thou fyndest Switzers Miles, then account two Switzers Miles for three
Germayne Miles.

GENTLE Reader, I thought it good, to advertise thee, ye I have orderly marked
in the margent, by certain letters, whereby thou shall know which are Cities,
Villages, or houses of Religion, lying in the way. (as thus) The letter C for a
City: the letter M for a Market Town: K for a Kloyster: and the letter V for a
Village, and so forth. And on the other side the Miles from one place to an
other: and for the half Mile, this letter. d.

Here follows the most used ways and passages from one notable City in
Germany, unto another. With certain brief descriptions of the antiquities of
diverse Cities.
And first of Augspurge.
THe City of Augspurge, is of great antiquity, taking the name after the
Emperor Augustus, and after many conflictes, had of the Romans, began to
flourish, but of late years it is so increased, in all abundance of riches,
and gorgious buildinges, that the like City is not found in all Germany.
Beside that, for merchandise it may compare with any city in Europe, forasmuch
as their trafique stretches through all places, as well in Africa, as in Europe.

From the City of Augspurge unto Nurnberg.

The City of Nurnberge, is replenyshed with cunning Artificers, in all kind
of Sciences, by which the Marchaunts thereof, and the whole city, is chefly

and travail, it can scarcely yield any commodity.

The Ci^ie of Mentz, was of ancient time callid Mogountia, and lay not at the
first so nigh the River of Rhein, as it now does, as plainly appears by a
wall and foundation of the city, yet to be seen, which standith on the side
beyond the same city: But where the city now standith, there was at the first
a Boolwerke or hold, in defense of the city, against the Germans, who
fou^did this city, at the first it is not perfecttly known, but doubtless it
is a city of great Antiquity, and lies very pleasantly, whereas the River of
Mayn does flow down from Franckforde, and the River Rehyn, also desending from
the high country, there is no city on the Rehin, whereas more ancient
Monuments are found, Claudius Drusus about the time of the Emperor Augustus,
erectid in this city, for an everlasting memory, a huge Rock like unto a
Tower of stone, the which there is yet to be seen, the Emperor Iulianus when
he warred with the Germans, made at this city a bridge over the Rehin, and
after him the Emperor Charles the great, by great labor and cost, foundid an
other bridge on the Rehin, the which was ^. hundrith paces long, for so broad
the Rehin runnith in that place, but this bridge continued not long, for it was
after consumed with fire, in the space of three hovvres, and nothing of the
said bridge remained, but the foundation being under the water. It is said
about the year. 425 that Saint Albaine, for the faith of Christ was martered
in this city.

THe people enhabiting about the city of Colen, before the birth of Christ,
were called the Vbi, and this was the principal and chief city (although
not called by this name) but after the enhabitants there about, the Romans kept
themselves of ancient time in this city, when as they hild continual vvares
with the Germans, the Emperor Julius Ceaser, in short time built a bridge of
vvood over the river of Rheyn, which runs along this city, by means
whereof, he might alvvaies give assault on the Germans. Afterward in tract
of time, when the city was repaired with curious and costly buildings, then
was the bridge made with stone, for the surer passing over: but who founded
the same it is not known. And after the Bishop Bruno by commandment of the
Emperor Otto the first, brake down the said bridge to the ground, because
that many robberies and murders were committed on the said bridge by night.
The city of Colen, after that the people called the Vbi, had the possession
thereof, it was named Agrippina, of Marcus Agrippa, and so it continued long
after under the Romans, unto the time of Marcomyrus king of France, who drove
the Romans from thence, about the year of our Lord. 400. and called the city
Colonia. After that, was the city taken again from the French king, by a
Duke of Saxony, who was then created Emperor. In the year 1388. was the
University of Colen erected, and the privileges thereof confirmed.

The city of Heydelberg, as some affirm, takes the name of certain berries,
growing on the mountains, nigh the same city, which are called
Heydelberies. But as some say, the name is taken of the heathen people, which
of old time inhabited in the mountains theraboutes. The city stands very
pleasantly, for the fair river Necker, runs forth along from the high
hills, fo commodious for the people, that it is to be thought, both the city
and country thereabouts has of ancient time been replenished with
inhabitants. In the year 1346. was the university of heydelberg erected, in
the which has from time to time been trained up, many learned men.

The city Franckford, being of ancient time called Helenopolis, and lying on

sundry Princes, that after the departure of the Romayne Kings, or Emperors,
the princes electors of Germany should assemble to gether, and out of the
chief christian Princes, choose one to possess the place of the Emperor

Straszburg is a city of great antiquity, and has been called of the Romans
Argentoratum, the city was first under those of Trier, and afterward subdued

the first christened king of France, founded therein the great Minster of our
Lady, and established there also a Bishops see, and after by means of the said
Bishop, is the city won again to be the habitation of the Germains. In this
city is found such a marvelous work, that the like is neither found in
Germany, Italic, nor yet in any country, it is a ^^ry fair and high steeple,
very curiously and cunningly garnished from the foundation to the top, very
strange and wonderful to the beholders. It might well be added unto the seven
wonders of the world, and make up the eight.
