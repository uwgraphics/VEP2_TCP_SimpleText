TO THE RIGHT Worshipful and Honorable dis posed, Sir THOMAS RIDGEVVAY
Knight, Treasurer and Vice-Treasurer at Wars in his Majesty's Realm of
Ireland.
ALthough I do not think these idle lines to be a fit present for your
judgment and wisdom, whom the Arts have adorned with knowledge and science,
but that I shall rather seem to inioyne you to a penance, then give you any
manner of content: yet (sir) having had former trials of your courtesies toward
me, I will number this amongst the rest of your favors: you see the best
gratification my ability can afford, is but a few paper words, and betwixt
kind words that be written, and kind words that be spoken, the difference is
small. I would be glad to arm them with some better merit, and to endeavor
any other thing that might be more acceptable unto you: in the mean time, I
shall acknowledge my self more beholding unto you, to vouchsafe me a reading,
then my little skill is able to merit by writing. I will not make any further
ostentation, neither will I light a candle to the sun, but will rest,

Always at your disposition BARNABE RYCH.

To all those Gentlemen, that are worthily so reputed.
GENTLEMEN, that you might the rather know your selves to be Gentlemen, I have
endeavored these lines, wherein I have distinguished of Gentlemen, both current
and counterfeit: I call them current, that are well known to be Gentlemen by
descent, or have been otherwise adua^ced by desert* either by service in the
field, or by any other virtuous endeavor, ^ending to the general good of the
common wealth.

I call them counterfeit, that do usurp the name and title of gentlemen, that
are lately crept out of a thatcht house, or from the dunghill, by scraping
together alittle pelf, that have neither petigree, virtue, nr honesty, whereby
to make claim, and yet will intrude themselves and take more upon them then
becomes baseness. I hope I shall neither off^nd the honest, nor discontent the
wise: for the rest, if they be a little rubd over the gaul, let them kick in
Gods name. He that cannot endure the reprehension of Sin, let him never go
to Church, and he that cannot abide to hear folly reproved, let him never
read Books. But as mistres Minx is many times sick, but she cannot tell
where: so there be some would fame find fault if they could tell how: but for
him that is of the reprehending humor, here is matter for him to work upon.
My lines are like the Shoomakers leather, that if a man complains of a strait
shoo, they will swear one days wearing will make it retch, again, if they be
too wide, they will say the leather will shrink in the wearing: so my lines
according to the disposition of the Reader, may be made either too short or too
long: for although I have fitted them to mine own fantasy, yet I know I cannot
fit them to every man's humor* In the same pasture where the Be ^^eazeth on
the flower, the ox feeds on the shrub: so readers some like Bees, and some
like Oxen, do convert things indifferent to particular qualities, for what the
one co^uerts to honey, the other turus to gall. Xenophon was wont to say, that
if beasts could paint, they would pourtray God himself like a beast: so the
ignorant sort, that will draw all things to their own appetites, and but to
what themselves do affect, will make those expositions of any thing they read,
as the writer himself never thought upon: and as they will not let to
dispraise those things that they could never conceive: so they will praise that
again which they never understood. We have too many of these expositors, that
can wrest generalities to private applications: I would b^ glad to bless my
self from them: but if I cannot escape them, my ^^re is the less, because it
is not my case alone, when it is general to as many as have had to do with
the printing press.

Room for a Gentleman, Or the Second Part of FAVLTES.
IT has been holden for a great blessing of God, when the sword and all
other weapons of war, are turned into Plough-yrons; but we do not consider
that war is the minister of Gods justice, either for contempt of himself,
neglect of his Religion, or for the wicked life of worldlings; it is the
surfers of peace, that hatcheth up war, and it is the finnes of the people,
that draws the Soldiers Sword, for wars are but as a Corrector to the
disorders of peace, it is as fire to the mettell that wants refining, as a
physician to a body ouergrowne with gross and corrupt humors, it is the
scourge of Security, the plague of Timeritie, a miserable necessity in nature,
and a necessary Corrector of times infirmity.

War, stirs up the blood, it calls courage to the field, and it is the Theater
where on Nobility was borne to show himself.

Peace breeds Cowards, it effeminates our minds, it pampers our wanton wills,
and it runs headlong into all sorts of sin.

VVarres, vpholds our right, Peace will put up wrong, and what we honorably
win in war, we cowardly loose again* in peace.

Peace, filles the world with pomp, war abates the edge of pride, Peace feeds
Folly fat, makes virtue lean, and it armeth Cape a Pee, all manner of inormity;
war spends the pelf that Peace has miserably scraped for. And what should I
say, war like a storm that comes rattling in the sky, does cleanse and purge
the air infected with the misty fogs of peace: war has had his beginning with
the world, and it will never have end so long as there is a world.

Valiancy has an eye to war, and war has the like again to peace, and
war should not be undertaken but to the end to have peace; and as peace is
the parent of prosperity, so it is the nurse of pride, and draws after it the
very corruption of manners.

In the time of peace, a favorite shall ruffell it out with the wealth of a
realm, whilst Soldiers in the time of war are ready to mutiny for want of
pay.

In war, those are only dignified that are found to be valiant, or otherwise
approved to be of worthy reputation, peace prefers Carpet Knights, and such
as will scratch at dignity without desert.

The Soldier, who in the time of war sauoreth of sweat, (the true testimony
of exercise and labor) in the time of Peace, is all to be spiced with
perfumes (the witness of effeminate and womanish nicite.)

As long as Carthage waged war against Rome, so long were the Romans in
daily exercise of Arms, vigilant and watchful, fearing that which after
followed* but Carthage being once razed and brought to destruction, the youth
of Rome being at liberty* and freed from all fear and care of War, set loose
the bridle of pleasure, and having no stranger against whom to exercise Arms,
they converted their weapons against their own bowels, arrearing civil wars
and seditions amongst themselves, which brought the Romans liberty to ruin:
for which cause S. Augustine in his book De Ciuitate Dei says, More hurtful
was the City of Carthage after her destruction, then during the whole course
and season of the wars, which the Romans had with her, for whilst they had
enemies in Affricke, t hey knew not what vices meant in Rome.

Adrianus in the time of a general peace, would yet undertake several
iornies, sometimes into France, sometimes into Germany, otherwhiles into Asia,
but still causing his men of war to march with him, lest being idle, they
might likewise grow effeminate.

I might heap together a great deal of matter, if I should speak of those
miseries that do attend and wait upon war; but if I should enter into a
particular description, how many vices are hatched up in the time of peace, I
might quickly spy out matter wherewith to begin, but never find time when to
make an end; we have such daily innouations, as well of Follies, as of Fassions,
that our ancestors (I perceive) were but bunglers at vice, they had not the
wit to grace a sin, nor to set it forth to the show, their conceits were but
dull and blunt, they had not the frisking wits of this our age: but I will
not entangle my self in that Laborinth, to speak of those follies that are
already past, I am come to a fragment of the time present, t^ a forward
Sprigge, that is already sprouted and sprung from this little pretty moment of
our calm and quiet peace.

The wars that were wont to stir up men's minds to strive who should march
in the foremost rank against the Enemy, who should give the first charge, and
who should make the first approach to enter the breach, this little time of peace
has converted to a base alteration: for now all our strife and contention is,
who shall sit above the salt, who shall go next the wall, who shall stand
foremost in the Herauldes books, and who shall go before, and who shall come
behind.

We call it a happy peace, and we bless the time withal, when our Arms are
set apart, when our Ensigns are fyrled up, and when our Drums and warlike
instruments do serve to fetch home May, or are hanged by the walls: but the
wars of Westminster Hall, are then in their greatest fury, and the incounters
there maintained and continued, not against an open foe to our country, not
against a Traitor to the Prince, or against a rebel, or a spoiler of the
common wealth; but the neighbor against the neighbor, the friend against the
friend, the brother against the brother, and sometimes the father against the
son.

These wars are unnatural wars, and these wars will never be dissolved, but
are like to grow every day more violent then other; and I wonder all this while
we have had no hot Alarmes about this precedence, and taking of places; for it
is grown to a general controversy, not only amongst the inferior forte of
those that would feign be reputed to be Gentlemen, but likewise amongst the
better sort of those that be known to be Gentlemen by birth and others that by
their places and professions are gentelized, and worthy to be so esteemed, as
hereafter shall be declared.

I will not meddle with those of the decayed order of Knighthood, amongst whom
there has likewise fallen out some contentions, the unworthy sometimes
comparing with those that be worthy; for I do make a difference in reputation
between Knight and Knight, and I hope hereafter to show a reason why.

But to come to those intruders that do extort to themselves places and
dignities that belong to others, who neither by birth, nor by descent can
challenge the place or title of a Gentleman, unless (perhaps) countenanced by
some petty office, or otherwise have raked together some yearly revenue, more
then all their ancestors were ever able to leave to their heirs* and not
attained unto by virtuous industry, but gotten sometimes by deceiving the
Prince, otherwhiles by preiudicing the common wealth, and most times, by
exacting and oppressing as many as they had to deal withal, but under these
pretenses, they would usurp to themselus a kind of pre-eminence, to throng and
thrust before those that are their betters both by birth and quality: and this
malipert sawcines makes them to be the more hateful to as many as know from
whence they are descended.

It is not the giving or taking of places, that either gives or takes away
virtue, nor every man that is invested with an office, is not therefore by and
by had in the better reputation, but if they be so desirous of estimation, they
must endeavor by their own labor and industry, to heap to themselus so precious
treasure, when courtesy and affability are known to be the instruments,
whereby the hearts of the people are won.

And as this thrusting and striving for places, is a common sickness amongst
men, so the infection is far more violent amongst women, and has prevailed
so far, as (I think) it be past cure, for not one amongst them, being
willing to give place, but every one endeavoring and striving to take place,
they are ready to scratch for it, and to take their rooms perforce, and will
not let to render reasons to maintain their right; one makes her plea, my
husband is a Squire, and I will give place to none but to my Lady; an other
will say, my husband is a Doctor, and why should not I go with the foremost: one
stands upon her own petigree, and deriues her self from some ancient stock
or family, another vauntes of her husbands office, another of his wealth,
another of her chains, jewels and silken gowns, and of so many other vanities
besides, that if their husbands should fall to dealing in those quarrels set
abroch by their wives, they would never be determined without bloody noses.

But what women be those that do most generally stand upon those terms, or
that will soonest press to be thus forward, but those that be of the basest
birth, or have been otherwise noted and detected of infamy?

I do not meddle with Ladies all this while, for although these vpstart women
be full of injury, yet Ladies that are descended of gentle parentage, are full
of courtesy, they are not vengible the one against the other, they are not
proud, they are not slanderous, they are no tatlers, to carpe at those things
that belongs not unto them; now Ladies in these days (a great many of them)
are none of these great vaunters, to brag of their worshipful parents, of
their fathers, of their grandfathers: they would be much ashamed in any proud
humor, to go search the Herauldes books for their ancestors Arms, or to
seek out from what stock or lineage they are descended.

But what do these men or women gain, that do stand so much of their tiptoes?
that do take the matter so highly upon them, and are so ready to perch before
their betters? they do but be*pisse their own credits? they raise up dust to
hurt their own eyes, for it makes others to harken after them, what they were
by birth, how they have been brought up, what their conversation has been in
times past: and there will be inquisition made, not only of themselves, but of
their parents, first what they were, from whence they came, and how they have
lived, for wise me^ takes no knowledge of our riches, but of our virtues, not
of our offices, but of our honesties, not of our dignities, but of our deserts;
not of our proud and lofty looks, but of our kind and courteous behauiours,
but howsoever it be befitting unto men, O what an ornament it is to a woman to
be of a mild and modest disposition?

And yet I cannot commend this counterfeit sobriety in her that will sit and
simper, and spend a whole diner-time, in speeches, strained and delivered like
oracles, that will be drawing out of a welcome, whilst a man would have eaten
his dinner: no, I rather commend her that has a little verbal quicknes, a
nimble spirited wench that can laugh when she list, weep when she list, chide
when she list, that can be sick when she list, and well again when it please
her self, that when she is up and ready in a morning, her day-worke is done,
that is fit for all companies, that has a sweet touch with her tongue, a
quick loose with her lips and it is no matter though she do sometimes lie;
for if she be married, a lie well told may sometimes please her husband.

O what a precious sight it were to see a woman that were but young in years
to be sober and modest, glory and admiration attends her in all her actions?
and it were good in her that were old likewise, because in an old woman, the
contrary were abominable, b ut where should we find such a woman ready made,
unless we should bespeake her of purpose, and then we should pay more for the
fashion, then the whole frame would be worth.

If a man should but strain his pen a little to write in the general praise
of women, and should paint them forth with so many perfections as nature does
not usually bestow in these our days, as many women as did but understand of
this description would wonder and be inquisitiue what women they should be that
were so magnified, and if they did not reward the writer with a mock, his best
recompense should be, to be thought a mere dissembler: but he that should
but blaze the abuse of any one particular woman, and should write in an obscure
manner, not naming what one it were that he had thus displayed, every woman
that did but hear it, would take it to her self, and she would not be
persuaded, but that it was so meant.

The precious jewels that were wont to garnish those women, that were most
honorably esteemed of, were the excellent ornaments of modesty, of sobriety,
of bashfulnes, of silence, of chastity, and such other, but now those are best
esteemed, that are most impudent, that are most audacious, that are most
shameless, that are most uncivil; and what shall I say, that are many ways
more masculine then men.

It is strange again to see some women that do stand upon their wisdom, that
do stand upon their honor, that do stand upon their honesty; and yet will seem
to uphold and maintain those women that are immodest in their manners,
lascivious in their life, filthy in their communication, odious and hateful in
all their demeanours, that have been noted of incontinencie, and well known
to be infamous: and yet those women, that a man would think they were made all
of virtue, (and without doubt, some of them no less good then they seem) they
will notwithstanding hold them company, take them up into their Coaches: nay,
they will imitate them, sometimes in their garish and light attire, that are
many times more Curtisan-like, then either modest or comely: sometimes again
in their impudent boldness of behavior, that were more fitting for my Lady
Greene-sleeues, then decent for those women, that are of any good sort or
reputation. Amongst the Romans, it was accounted a great reproach and infamy,
for a woman to be praised by any man, either for her beauty, or for her
feature, or for any quality that was not corespondent to virtue* but Thucidides
accounts those women to be most honest, that were least spoken of either in
praise or disprayse.

Saint Augustine speaking of the light behavior of women, does rather allow of
that maiden, wife or widow, that will exercise her accustomed labor, (though
it be on the Saboth day) then he does of that woman that is a dancer, that must
surrend^r herself to be felt and handled by those men, that are not only
unchaste in their imbracements, but many times ungodly in their appetites, and
filthy in their desires.

I might take occasion here to speak of Fashions, it was wont to be a disease
amongst Horse, but now it is become a general sickness amongst men and women;
and yet I think Fashions be good for somewhat, for of my conscience it drives
a great number to Church, that goes more to show their own pride, and to learn
the new Fashions that are broughtin by others, then to mend their own manners,
or to level their lives as they are taught by the Preacher.

Diogenes laughed them to scorn, that by intercession sought help from the
Gods, and yet continued in a dissolute and in a lascivious manner of life: and
me thinks it stands with reason, that grave shows and light attires can never
hang well together.

When the Cretans were unnaturally entreated by the Romans, they did not pray
unto the Gods to plague them with pestilence, with war, with famine, and such
like, but that they would send amongst them new Fashions, new inventions, and
new fangled follies, which they knew to be a greater plague and punishment,
then any other that might befall them: And Anacharsis was put to death for
seeking to plant strange fashions which he had learned in his travel.

For those women that be good and godly (as I know there be a great many) they
will never be displeased though I blaze the abuses of the ill; for those other
that be bad, if they be angry I care not, and for her that has a guilty
conscience, if she find her self to be touched, let her begin to chide first
in Gods name.

It is written that Crates used to scold with common women, which he knew to be
of mischievous and vengible tongue* which he did of purpose, whereby to inure
himself to bear all reproaches with the more patience: And Diogenes, to much
like purpose, walking through Athens, and finding the statues and Images of
many woe thy men which had been erected for their well deserving in the common
wealth, went unto them al, one after another, begging gifts and asking of
alms: and being demanded what he meant to beg of dumb Images, he answered, I
learn hereby to take denial patiently.

Now if there be a woman that is sick of the spleen, and a little to ease her
stomach, will needs pronounce her self guilty before she be accusde, I am
furnished (you see) with presidents enough to teach me to be patient, and to
bear all reproaches that may be imputed against me, by the most bitterest and
spitefullest tongs.

A woman of virtuous life is never offended at any report that is ay^ed of her;
for if it be true (she being virtuous) it must be to her praise, if false, her
life and manners will prove the reporter to be but a liar, and her own
innocence is enough to protect her against any deprauer.

But I am out of the text that I meant to take in hand; and here a man may see
what it is to hit into good company, I am gotten amongst a company of women,
and now I am loath to depart; but I must take my leave of them for a time, and
follow my undertaken Subject.

I remember, I was about to speak of a many of wranglers that were striving
for places, and disputing for dignities, but fearing I might be accused of
sacrilege to steal out of the Gospel, I might remember here where it is
written; When thou art bidden to a Feast, sit thee down in the lowest room,
that when the goodman of the house comes in, he may say, Friend, sit up
higher, and so it shall be for thine honor, etc.

It is a great virtue in a man, to be an upright Judge of himself, for as it
is the first Chapter of Fools, for a man to think himself to be wise; so it
is a sign of as little wit, to think better of our selves then there is cause.

Bucephalus, Alexanders horse, in an ordinary saddle, would easily admit any
man to ride him, but being appointed in his royal furniture, would suffer none
but Alexander to mount him: so there be some that in a mean estate (such as
their fathers held before them) have been known to be lowly and tractable
enough, but being after crept into an office, or a little advanced, whereby
they might proule for pence, they know not how to behave themselves, but do
think that pride, disdain, and currish demeanor, are the only complements
belonging to Gentility. And this is it that armeth them with this sawcines (I
mean) to take place of their betters whereby they become injurious, and in time
might grow to a matter of quarrel, when amongst persons of reputation, honor
is preferred before life; and every injurious action not repulsed, is holden by
the opinion of all magnificent minds to be dishonorable, infamous and
reproachful.

It should not be amiss therefore, but rather behouefull, that we might be
informed what injury is, whereby we may with the more facility, both moderate
our selves, and learn to repress it.

I do not go about to incite men to unadvised or needles quarrels, but to
inform the true mean how to shun offenses, or being offended, how to
repress an injury, with a due respect, both of honor and a christian
consideration: Injuries are as well offered by words as by deeds; in words,
by unseemly speeches, as in giving the lie, or such other like; in deeds, no
less by depriving men of their reputation and right, as in deprauing them of
their due by any other meane^ I might speak of infinite wrongs to be offered
in both these kinds, that might draw to blows: but I will let them pass, for
I hold it no less expedient for wisemen to know when it is time to put up, as
when it is time to draw their weapons.

Virtue allows a just Revenge, and admits the defense of property and
right: yet true it is, that the law of God wills us to be of that perfect
patience, as not only to endure injurious words, but also quietly to digest
and putvp all other wrongs that are offered, what, or howsoever: but very few
men have attained to that perfection in suffering wrongs and injuries, as the
Law of God requires: there is nothing more intolerable to flesh and blood,
then to endure wrong; let Divinity and Philosophy too, persuade what they list,
for impatient cruelty, making hot spurde youth his Agent, does think no man
capable of glory, that is not apt and ready to revenge.

And here Cicero, to aggrauate the matter, tells me, That it is as great
injustice to put up an injury, as to do awrong: But if it be injustice to
put up an injury, why then it is a virtue to Revenge, but Revenge proceeds
of Anger, for Anger is the mother of Revenge, and what affinity may be between
angry Revenge, and doing of Justice, I think is as much as is between doing
of right, and doing of wrong, and so by consequence as is between virtue and
vice.

I know not how to reconcile these matters together, but for him that is
injured I think the surest way is to revenge himself by patience, for he
that is armed with patience, to endure and suffer wrong, punishes more in not
punishing, then the hastiest Executioner that is most speedy in revenge.

Perhaps (now on the other side) it may seem contrary to the courage of man,
to relent when they have done a wrong, but rather to persist, and to uphold one
wrong with another, the less with the greater: if we could then but examine
the matter with a christian consideration, it would appear that he that does
persist to do evil, does still endeavor to condemn himself.

Who will impute him to be worthy of infamy, that is cowardly stricken by
another, or that is oppressed by advantage by any manner of mean? nay, who
will not rather condemn him that offers such an injury and acquit him to
whom it was done?

And who will not laugh to see the sawcines of some little worthy persons, in
whom there is neither virtue, desert, nor any other merit of worth, but a
little audatious boldness, and yet will perch and presume to take that place
that is an other man's right?

To conclude therefore I say, that infamy is due to him, that willingly does a
dishonorable wrong; but no reproach at all to him that takes it.

But to the end that men might know their own places, both what they ought to
take, and how they ought to give, it shall not be amiss to distinguish of
Gentry, and to show the difference between Gentlemen and Gentlemen; from
whence, and how it grows.

I say there is a disequality in Gentry, for virtue being (as it were) the
first step to Generosity, he that can bur vaunt of the Scutchions left unto
him by Ancestors, seems himself to be very destitute, for the more high he
fetches his petigrie, the less reputation he meriteth himself, if he cannot
continue that honor, left unto him by his Ancestors.

Whilst we do hunt after a fantastical glory, we do abandon the true; for
the ground of honor consists in virtue.

Marcus Marcellus builded a Temple in Rome, which he called the Temple of
Honor; but so seated, that none could enter it, but they must first pass
thorough the Temple of Virtue.

It might be demanded, why noble blood should be preferred before base
Parentage (as they call it) for neither is he that is of Gentle blood more
valiant then he that is of low degree, neither in his race more swifter, nor in
health more lusty* nor of greater force; if then the case stands thus, that
neither the favor of Fortune, nor the comely feature of the body,
distinguishes man from man, and as it were, by distinct offices deuideth them,
no doubt, the diversity is known by the qualities of the mind.

Gein Ottoman brother to the great Turk, being a prisoner at Rome, it was
told him, how Fardinando was nimble and quick in running, leaping, vawting,
and such other exercises of the body: Ottoman answered that the slaves and base
borne of his Country were endued with all those qualities, and that the Princes
and mighty men, were only famed and renowned for their valiance, their bounty
and liberality.

An excellent answer of a Heathen, and it is truth, the Gentility as it is a
glorious image of ancient progeny, so it is commonly garnished and replenished
with singular virtues, far exceeding the common sort.

Seneca advises, that who would judge of a Gentleman, that might be reputed
worthy of that name, must first strip him out of his gay clothes, he must set
aside his liuinges and titles of honor, with all other favors of Fortune, he
mustalso imagine himto be with out a body, nor he must esteem nor value
nothing, but the excellency of the mind. If Gentlemen in these days should be
brought to these Balances, and none admitted worthy but those that hold out
weight, there would not be such a thronging and thrusting as there is, the
bordes end would be more pestered th en the first mess.

I hold not him that from a base estate is exalted by a Princes favor
(without desert) to be a Gentleman* for a Prince at his pleasure may make a man
either rich or poor, but to make him either good or bad, belongs only to
the grace of God, but not to the Prince.

A Prince may then make a man great, but he cannot make him good, he may give
him honorable titles, but he cannot give him an honorable mind; and albeit
that Gentlemen of late preferment, may excel in virtue, wit and policy; yet in
this minority of years, they may not compare with families of noble blood, and
long descent: for even as we do chiefly reverence gray hayres and elder years;
so the ancient race of gentility, is especially to be esteemed and honored,
and a new made Gentleman, with what quality so ever endued (yet being the first
of his house) must give place to the other, that are of more ancient lineage
and more honorable descent, provided always, that those that are digressed
from the virtuous endeavors of their honorable ancestors, let them be reputed
as degenerate, and unworthy to challenge either place or title: for he that does
swerue from the steps of his ancestors, he staineth the name of his family.

The Romans and the Lidians had a Law, that those sons that followed not
their fathers steps in virtue, but lived in a licentious and vicious manner
of life, should be disinherited, and their lands and goods bestowed of the
most honest of the race: And we see many families, that in times past were
obscure, and in small account, are now inkindled and stirred up, to purchase
praise and win renown, by their own virtuous indeauors: we see others
again that have descended from old and ancient families, that by their own
vicious and vilde demeanoures, have cracked their own credites, and have
extinguished the glory of their predecessors.

By a Gentleman born, it is meant, he must be descended from three degrees of
Gentry, both by father and mother (for this is the opinion of the Heraldes)
otherwise they are called Gentlemen of the first head, nightgrowne, mushrumpes,
start-vppes and such other.

Nobility it self (as some would describe it) is a commendation proceeding
from the deserts of our ancient Progenitors: but to speak truly, both
according to Divinity and Philosophy, there is no true Nobility, but that
which proceeds from virtue.

Faith is a rich treasure, yet without works it is dead; so Nobility is
honorable, but without virtue it is base. Jacob and Esau were brethren descended
from one womb, yet the one was noble by virtue, the other ignoble by vice: so
Titus and Domitian were both sons to the Roman Emperor vespatian, but
Titus was called by the Senate, The delight of the world, and Domitian through
his execrable tyranies was named, The monster of human kind. Nobility
without virtue, is like a Knighthood without desert: and as there has been
many noble Families, excelling in virtue, and quality of wit, so there has
been Cities of honorable account, namely, that of Athens, worthily famed and
renowned, where there were bred many wise sages an d valiant Captains, which
through their counsel and wisdom did rule and preserve the weal public, by
whose puisance the enemy was repelled, by whose unconquerable courage and
virtue, their dominions were enlarged.

I might likewise speak of mighty Rome, that was sometimes mistress of the
world, it was then accounted a great glory to be reputed a Roman: but as (by
the opinion of her own writers) she had her original from a base and a
bastardly generation, I mean, from the fugitive Trojans that escaped the
burning town, and slaughtered heaps of their betrayed Countrymen: but her
glory has been since obscured, and (as it were) ouershadowed with darkness:
but I wonder that our English Nation, for the glory of antiquity should be so
fond to recount their Genealogy fro m such a desteyned progeny: a fugitive
people, a crauen generation, hunted and ferrited, from place to place, from
country to country, from region to region: their City of Troy it self three
times sacked, yet to prove our discents from thence, we do mingle our matters
with so many fained inventions, as it might seem strange unto wisemen, but
more absurd to enterlace the vain fantasies of Poets with matters of truth; and
that it might the better appear, I will set down the story in as brief and
short manner as I can.

Leomedon the son of Dardanus, the feyned son of Jove, a false perjured
Prince, for whose offense (as their own hystories makes mention): Troy was
first overflowed by the raging of the sea, after that visited again with a
most deadly plague; which could not be appeased but by the monthly gift of a
Virgin, to a seamonster, as they fell out by lot, till in continuance of time,
it lighted on Hesione the daughter of Leomedon, who was rescued and freed by
Hercules upon conditions formerly vowed, protested and plighted by oath to be
performed by Leomedon to Hercules: but Hesione being delivered, the sea monster
slain, and the City freede from all incombrances by Hercules: Leomedon now
again falsifying his promise, Hercules to reu enge the disloyalty of that
twice perjured prince, first sacked the City of Troy, where Leomedon saving
himself by flight, Hercules carried away with him prisoners, Priamus and
Hesione, the children of Leomedon, who after Hercules being departed, returned
again, and having reedifyed and new builded the city, was a second time
assaulted by Hercules, who having slain Leomedon, and now again taken the
City; Hercules that was magnificent in all his enterprises, enlarged Priamus,
and established him in Troy to succeed his father; who yet again erected and
builded that unfortunate City which flourished in pomp and pride till his
son Paris, (who nothing digressing from his unfaithful progenitors) in a
treacherous manner stole away Helena the wife of Menelaus, king of Lacedemon,
who had both honorably feasted, banqueted and entertained both him and his
company: in revenge of which fact, the angry Greeks ariuing before Troy with a
mighty Army, after ten years siege, and a great slaughter of Princes, with
other valiant men, by the treason of Aeneas, together with the consent of his
father Anchises, and Antenor his confederate; the City of Troy was taken,
miserably burnt and defaced, the country ruined and wasted, the aged king
Priamus miserably slain, and the whole Trojan estate utterly overthrown: thus
writes Dictis Cretensis, that served with the Greeks against the Trojans
during that ten years wars, who makes a large description of the disloyalty
of the Trojans, and (in mine opinion) not without just cause; for although
Virgil in his Aenidos does write more favorably in their behalf, it is to be
considered that the Romans deriuing themselves from the Trojans, Virgil
himself being a Roman, does therefore labor so much as in him lies to
color out the vnfaithfullnes of the Troyans, and would likewise derive the
Trojan Princes from the line of the Pagan Gods, which they themselves had
deified; but if Dardanus were the son of Jove (as their writers do report)
his Son Leomedon that proved perjured, faithles and untrusty, did far
digress from any sacred disposition: so did Paris, that was Priams son, who
showed himself rather to proceed from the issue of a devil, then from the
line of a God, as it appeared in his behavior, both to Oenone; who before had
saved his life, and again with Menelaus, that in such a princely sort had
entertained him.

And what shall I say of our great Grandsire Aeneas, from whom the Romans
would so feign derive themselves? and from whom (as some of our English
writers would persuade) our British nation did descend? let us see what Virgil
himself does testify of him, whose pen is stained in the finest manner, to
blazon forth the glory of Aeneas, yet does he not describe him to be the
son of a common strumpet begotten by old Anchises of Venus, whom the Romans
have diefied together with their great Gods Flora, another bird of the same
wing: but Aeneas, after he had betrayed his countey, he himself with the rest
of his treacheious companions, were forced to wander at the sea, robbing and
spoiling, attending what Destiny would bestow of him, landed in the end upon
the coast of Africa, at new built Carthage, where he likewise falsified his
faith, and betrayed Dido, and so leaving Carthage, in the end arrived in Italy,
where, by menacing threats mingled with fair promises, together with
corruptions and gifts, he made such discord and dissension in the country, by
means whereof such horible slaughters of the people were committed, that
dispossessing the quiet princes thereof, he established himself in the
kingdom, reigning there until he died, after him, his fugitive son Ascanius
reigned, and his brother Siluiu Posthumus succeeded him, that was afterward
slain by his unblessed Babe Brute, who for that fact was banished Italy, and
(as some writers would have it) after he had troubled many quiet countries,
arrived in England, the called Albion, from whence they would derive our English
Petigrie: and this descent is not lightly accounted of by those that are of
little understanding, as though it were such a dignity to be reputed the
posterity of a harlots brood: I like not the conceit, and I hold it to be as
fabulous, as that of Dioclesian the Sirian Prince, who (as some of our English
Croniclers do affirm, committed thirty of his daughters to the sea in a small
vessel without Pylote or guide, who chancing to land in this Isle, called it
Albion (after one of their own names) and after this arrival of these thirty
sisters, they were carnally known by Devils, and brought forth a propagation
of Giants, which were afterward slain by Brutus.

A ridiculous tale, and for matter and circumstance, fitter to furnish the
Legenda Aurea, then to be inserted for matter of truth in a Chronicle history,
and it may well become the Romans to brag of their predecessor Aeneas; but
for us that be English (me thinks) there should be small pride to depend of
that antique generosity, that is so basely descended: and again, comparing of
histories, there is no possibility, how the tales can hang together: for the
fictions of Poets, they are no grounds for Historians to build upon, and
therefore to return again to our first purpose, I say, there are degrees of
gentry, as well as of dignities and honors, and that one is so much more a
Gentleman by birth then another, by how much his Gentry is more ancient, more
renowned, more manifest, and more mighty, which may be said, not only in
respect of birth, but likewise in respect of virtue.

Gentlemen be of three kinds, the first in respect of blood, for so the
vulgar sort understands it; the second, in respect of virtue, for so the
philosopher does teach it: the third, in respect of both, and that (say I) is
true Gentry indeed.

Gentry by blood belongs but to the body; but gentry by good conditions,
has relation to the mind: but when a man is gentill both by birth and virtue,
I see not what may be added unto him: yet some would have a third supply of
riches and wealth, but riches can add no degree to a Gentleman, and he that
would draw gentry from wealth, is injurious to the graces that are given us
from the heavens.

But wealth is a ready instrument to put in practice certain virtues belonging
to gentry, namely, bounty, and liberality: otherwise riches are rather a
disgrace then a grace to a Gentleman, that does not bestow them bountifully, as
is befitting his estate.

Yet those that be of the scraping humor, will sometimes pilfer a Text out of
the holy Scripture, which, wresting into a wrong sense, they will allege for
themselves, that their greedy heaping and gathering together, is but a
christianlike care, that every man should have to provide for his family.

These scraping excuses are fitter for Churles then for Gentlemen, (and yet me
thinks) Simonydes shifted himself pretily, who being demanded, why he began
to grow so miserable in his latter years, to fall a hording up of riches, when
he was ready for the grave; to acquit himself from a covetous disposition,
answered, because (said he) I had rather have goods to leave to mine enemies
when I am dead, then to stand in need of my friends, whilst I am alive.

I cannot forget to give Dionisius his due commendation, who being advertised
of one that abounded in wealth, and yet lived a sparing and a miserable life,
he commanded the party upon pain of death, to bring in his riches, and to
resigneall that ever he had to be disposed at his pleasure: the party that
durst not directly contradict what the King had commanded; made semblance to
deliver all that ever he had, but secretly reserving a small portion to
himself, wherewith departing into a remote place, he after lived with that
little pittance, (which he had concealed in a more bountiful manner, then ever
he had done before when he was possessed of his greatest abundance; which
being certified to Dionisius, he sent yet once again for him, and giving him
all which before he had taken from him, he said; now thou know how to use
riches, take what is thine own, for now thou well deseruest them.

I might conclude, that if the enjoying of wealth and riches, be matter
sufficient, to make a man to be gentilized, it were then a vilde thing to be a
Gentleman, because they are seldom attained unto, but by oppression,
extortion, deceit, fraud, and such other corruption* there are comprised under
the title of Gentry, all Ecclesiastical persons professing religion, all
Martial men that have borne office, and have had command in the field; all
Students of Arts and Sciences, and by our English custom, all Innes of Court
men, professors of the Law: It'skilles not what their Fathers were, whether
Farmers, Shoomakers, Taylers or Tinkers, if their names be enrolled in any Inn
of Court, they are all Gentlemen.

The profession of Arms being honorable, every ordinary Soldier that has
served seven years without reproach, ought to be accounted a Gentleman, and by
the laws of Arms may challenge the combat of any Gentleman, in defense of his
reputation.

A Gentleman having aspired to any title or dignity in the field, and in
respect of age, or of any other infirmity is retired to his own house, or to
any other resting place, ought nevertheless to enjoy that title and
reputation, which he had formerly gained.

Amongst Students, there be many, that to attain wisdom and knowledge, have
betaken themselves to continual study, and have thereby attained to singular
virtues, and for profound knowledge in many matters, be had in admiration: but
that kind of virtue that extends it self to the common profit of al men,
that is altogether occupied about the maintenance of the common wealth, has
his first preferment, but those that do but employ the benefit of their
studies to some particular purpose, or to their own private gain, must give
place to the former. The true martialing of sovereign honor, to place every
one in his right degree, and to give him his due; the Divine is first to have
preferment, for the Minister of the word of God ought to have the chiefest and
most honorable place, especially when they be such as they ought to be, as
Saint Paul writing to Timothy: They deserve to have double honor (faith he)
where they read or preach the Gospel, and where their works and manner of
living are conformable and agreeing to their doctrine. And as Saint Hierome
says; Great is the dignity of Prelates, but greater is their fall if they be
wicked.

But this honor thus rendered unto them, they can not challenge as their
proper right or due apertaining to themselves, for that Prelate that is
ambitious of worldly honor and estimation, does rather smell of the Spirit of
Antichrist, then show himself to be a follower to our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, whose prescriptions are humility: for he that exalts him self, or
desires to be great amongst you, let him be brought low (says our Savior)
let him be your servant.

It is manifest, that in Matthew and Mark, he reproves the ambition of the
Sons of Zebedie, who ambitiously desired the one to sit on his right hand,
the other on his left; and as Christ elsewhere condemns the ambitious
affections of such as ambitiously desire to exalt themselves, and to seek
superiority: so does he in like sort condemn all other, what or who soever,
that are so puffed up with pride and arrogance, that they disdain to give place
and reverence to those that have jurisdiction and magistracy in the Church of
God: and there is no less pride and contempt in those that will refuse to give
honor and reverence to him that is in authority to bear office and rule in
the ministry, then there is in him on the other side, that does ambitiously
desire to rule, but not to profit the Church; the which, so far as my little
skill will afforde me, may most aptly be applied to the Pope and his
shauelings.

But he that has any spiritual charge, or has the cure of souls in the
Church of God, I say with Saint Paul, He is worthy of double honor, and he
that diligently preaches the Gospel and conformeth his life according to his
doctrine (I say still) we cannot reverence him enough, nor render him too much
honor.

Our Savior himself would in no wise take upon him to judge between the
brethren that came unto him about the division of their land; neither is there
any example in all the New Testament, where any of the Apostles (after their
calling) intermedled which matters appertaining to temporal Magistracy, but
applied their whole endeavors to the preaching of the Gospel; the ancient
Romans had that observation, for they would in no wise admit that their
Flamius, nor any other of their sacrificing Priests, should bear any rule or
government in the common wealth, but that they should only exercise
themselves in the service of their Gods: but this prohibition was not done in
any disgrace, whereby to abate or diminish the least jot of their honor or
estimation, for king Dridanias censuring of professions, which might be most
worthy, gave the highest degree of honor to the Priests, that did daily offer
sacrifice in the temples of their Gods.

If the Heathen did thus much exalt and dignifie the reputation of these
profane Priests that were but dedicated to the service of Idols, and Pagan
Gods, what estimation, what reverence, what honor may we render to those that
are the Ambassadors of the Almighty God? that are sent unto us with the glad
and joyful tidings of our salvation? that are our Fathers to begetvs to Jesus
Christ, by the preaching of his Gospel? that are his Stewardes to dispense his
holy mysteries amongst us: to whom we are not only to attribute honor, but
for whom we are also bound to pray: if they do not make themselves unworthy
of it by their own contempt, by their covetousness, by their pride, and by
their ambition, as there be some that have set themselves opposite to the
ordinance of the Church, that have set the holy scriptures at a jar, that
will many times make the gloss to overthrow the Text, that will cry out for
Discipline, yet will obey no Discipline, that will take upon them to teach al
men, yet they themselves will not be taught, that are angry against Bishops,
and would not have them to be Lords, yet are become so Lady like themselves,
that they would have every one a new fashion particular to himself: these are
to proud in their own conceits, these be they that disdaining to yield to
authority* do show greater pride in their contempt, the^ the other can show in
their most ambitious desires.

Saint Paul writing to Timothy: He that desires the office of a Bishop,
that man desires a good work: I hope the office of a Bishop is not
altogether without authority, and that authority in the Church of God, is not
altogether unworthy of honor: and where Christ prohibited his Disciples, that
they should not be caled Rabbi, that they should not be called Doctors, etc. by
the opinion of the most learned writers, those words of Christ do not condemn
superiority, lordship, or any other like authority, but the ambitious desire
only; neither does he say elsewhere, that no man should be great, or bear
rule amongst them: but his words are; He that desires to be great amongst you,
let him be humbled, And Timothy notwithstanding those words spoken by Christ,
calls himself the Doctor of the Gentiles; and Paul in like manner writing to
the Corinthians, calls himself their Father.

Now as the holy Scriptures exhorts the professors of the Gospel to be
humble and meek, so we ought to render them the first title of honor, and to
give the^ precedence in the foremost rank, especially to those that do not
ambitiously desire it. Lo, hear now the difference between the Disciples of
Christ, and the followers of Antichrist, the one refuses the preferme^ts of
the world, that are offered unto them by the Devil, and contenteth themselves
with their vocation in the ministry: the other with the Pope, accepts of all that is offered, and besides their ecclesiastical promotions, they hunt after
temporal jurisdictions, and other proud titles of the world, to uphold and
maintain their pride and ambition, for the better manifestation whereof, I
think it will not be out of season to remember a jest, that was merrily broken
by a plain Country fellow, upon one of the Popes Chaplains, the Bishop of
Cullen, who passing on a journey sumptuously mounted, and gorgeously furnished,
both himself and all the rest that were in his company, was encountered by a
rude country fellow, who coming to the Bishop, after he had bluntly saluted
him, he said, my Lord, I have heard speaking of Peter and Paul, and of some
others that were reputed to be good and godly men, I may well commend their
goodness, but I will never praise their wit, for they were glad to amble about
the country on foot, for falling followed (perhaps) with some poor thread bare
fellows like themselves, but I see God has provided for your Lordship better
then for them, or your wisdom is the more to provide so well for your self.

The Bishop that heard himself to be thus pretily nipt, returned this
answer; but sir (said he) you mistake your text, you think I take more
state upon me, then is befitting an Apostle; but let Peter and Paul go or
ride how they list, I am not only the Bishop of Cullen, but I am over and
besides a Prince Elector: and for this state that you think I take upon me,
as you think it to be too much for a Bishop, so I know it to be too little
for a prince, and thus you are answered: you have answered well (said the
other), but good my Lord but one question more, if this prince Elector, that
you speak of, do happen to go to the Devil for his pride, what will become
of my Lord Bishop of Cullen?

We might make the like demand to the Pope, who notwithstanding his humble
p^etence to be Seruus Seruorum Dei, yet he assumeth to himself the dispose
of the whole world, and not contented with that neither but he further takes
upon him to have command both in Heaven and Hell, to let in, and shut out, as
it pleases him: but because his intolerable pride is well enough known, I
may be the more sparing: it was the bounty and liberality of princes, that
first begat this ambition in Popes: so, ambition was it again, that first
destroyed Religion: but for the true professors of the Gospel (I protest) I
think it a sin, to carry any ill conceit against the^, whose prayers unto
God does so appease his displeasure toward us, that he many times forbeareth
to punish us, when we have worthily deserved it: and as the prayers of Moses
did rather procure the victory against Amalecke, then all the swords that did
accompany Joshua to the fight: so I believe that the petition of one godly man,
delivered with a confident zeal, is of more effect then the prayers of a
multitude, that are but breathed in words, and are rather uttered from the
mouth, then proceeding from the heart.

Having thus placed the Divine in the foremost rank; the Soldier is next to be
preferred: for honor cannot be wanting in those men of valor, that have
restored to their country their blood, which their conntrie first gave unto
them: if we stand upon birth only, then the most ancient, whether in
Nobility or Gentility: if we stand upon desert, then the martial man, he that
does deliver his country from the servitude of strangers, the oppression of
Tyrants, that does countermaund the miseries of civil dissentions, that does
restrain the pride* and ambition of aspiring traitors, that does enlarge their
territories, defend their liberties, uphold and maintain Justice, and make
honorable defense against all inuaders.

The Soldier is the man that holds the whole world in awe, and is not only
a sure defense against foreign invasions, but likewise against domestical
rebellions: we need not in this case to seek after far fet precedents, when
we have home examples enough of our own, who has not heard of Jack Straw,
Jack Cade and of Ket, with many others now of later times in Ireland, that if
the Soldiers sword had not been of greater virtue, then a writ out of the
Kings Bench, to have brought them before my Lord Chief Justice, they would
neither have made appearance nor have paid fees.

I say then, that the execution of Justice lies in Arms* but (me thinks) I
see a Lawyer laugh at this, for those that be of the sorrier sort of Lawyers,
will in no wise that the Soldier should be a maintainer of Justice, for that
they only would arrogate to themselves: but for the better credit of the
matter, I will salute my Masters of the Law with a few words delivered by S.
Ambrose, and thus they follow.

Valiant men that do defend their Country, and protect the Weal from spoil
and ruin, do the office of true justice; Soldiers do protect the common
wealth, and they defend it from all sorts of spoil, either foreign or
intestine, but only, they cannot save it from the spoil of the Lawyers.

Having thus placed the Divine and now the Soldier, in the third rank are to
march, those that do compose and compound laws and ordinances, for the
maintenance of right and civil society* amongst these the venerable and
reverend Judges, and all other that are established in office and authority
under Princes, but especially, if they execute their places with honor and
honesty.

The Lawyers will never think me to be a good Sariant Mayor, to martial them
thus in the Rereward, that would rank themselves with the foremost; especial,
in the time of peace, for they take themselves to be the only Agents of a
happy government.

It is our wickedness that makes the Lawyer necessary; so necessity is it, that
makes him honorable, and therefore he is not to march in equal rank,
neither with the Soldier, nor with the Philosopher.

The principal office of the Law is, in the time of peace to command things
honest and virtuous, and to forbid what is dishonest and vicious; but what can
the Lawyer do with his prescriptions, before there be a settled obedience,
which is first to be established by the Soldier?

It is truth, the Lawyer and the Soldier could never thrive both in one shire,
and therefore no marvel though they cry out with Tully, Caedant arma togae,
for, these do not only love to sleep in a whole skin, and are afraid of
knockes, but under the pretense of honoring peace, they would both excuse
their cowardice, and would arrogate to themselves a supreme authority, to be
the principal pillars to conserve and uphold peace; and because Tully would
have it, that weapons should give place to the gown, they would from hence
conclude, that the Soldier must give place to the Lawyer; but as good luck
would have it, Tully himself in the same book of Officis, has bequeathed a
double honor unto those men, who armed do make war, and robbed do govern
the common wealth: and the Poets have fained Minerua to be armed, signifying,
that Captains and Soldiers, should be as wise in counsailing, as courageous in
conquering as politic in keeping, as valiant in getting.

But to put all questions out of doubt, and that the Lawyer should not think
himself disgrast, by giving place to the Soldier, I will prove by sufficient
instance that the profession of Arms is more honorable then the profession of
Law, and so by consequence the Soldier is of greater worth and excellency then
the Lawyer.

The affairs of war is a knowledge behoueful for the greatest Monarch, when
a king is not so much renowned for his crown, as for his skill in knowledge of
Arms. The nine Worthies of the world, were Martial men, reputed honorable
for their prowes, not for their knowledge either in Law or Philosophy though
the knowledge of them both be of great excellency.

Although all the gifts of Fortune are to be despised in respect of learning;
yet there is nothing so glorious, as to be called a great Captain, or a
worthy Soldier: and it was very neatly answered by him, who being demanded by
his friend, whether he had rather to be Achilles or Homer; asked the other
again, whether he had rather to be a Captain or a Trumpeter: letters are but
the ornaments of Arms, and learning is more necessary for a man of War, then
for any other profession.

The adventures undertaken by war, the true provocation is glory; but he that
sauoureth not the fruits of letters, has as little feeling in the greatness of
glory. A man that is ignorant in Arts, can never excel in Arms, and as Plato
says; Happy is that common wealth, where either the Prince is a Philosopher,
or where a Philosopher is a prince: so it may be called a fortunate war,
where the chief Commander is a great scholar, or a great scholar is the
chief Commander.

What made the Romans to become so famous, but that their Captains and
Commanders were as great scholars as they were warriors? it is not exercise
in war, that makes every man fit to be a Captain, though he follow the
profession never so long, especially, if he be unlearned; yet there is none so
unapt for the war, but if he be lettered, it so much the more helps his
experience.

A man that is aged (let his years be never so many) yet he sees but the
things that are done in his own time, but the learned man sees not only his
own age and experience, but whatsoever has been done many hundred years
past, yea since the first Writer took pen in hand: and therefore as well
amongst Soldiers, as amongst all other professions, the unlearned must give
place to the learned, for no memory can compare with writing. And as amongst
the unlearned, he that has lived fourscore years, must have more experience,
then he that has lived but forty: so he that sees by books the accidents
of a thousand years, knows more then he that by living a hundred years is
able to attain unto.

I might infer examples of excellent Captains of old time, which all enjoyed
the ornament of letters, with the prowes of Arms.

It is well known that Alexander had Homer in such reverent estimation, that
he laid his Iliades always under his beds head; and he applied diligently
not those studies only, but also the speculation of philosophy, under the
discipline of Aristotle.

Alcibiades in like manner increased his understanding, as well by letters, as
with the instructions of Socrates. What diligence Caesar used in study, his
own writings do sufficiently make manifest.

Scipto Affricanus would not go without the books of Xenophon.

I might further speak of Lucullus, Scilla, Pompeius, Brutus, and of many
other both Romans and Gretians, that were famous Soldiers and great
Philosophers, and how conversant a matter it has been in times past for Arts
and Arms to march together in one rank.

This might suffice to prove that the dignity of the soldier is not bestowed
upon him gratis, or (as it were) without desert; but that it appertains unto
him by property and right, and but according to his own merit; then who is
more fit to manage the affairs of peace, as he that has an able judgment to
know what is fit both for peace and war.

But it has been a former question, and disputation has been had many
years since, what profession might be thought to be most worthy; and sundry
men have hereupon given their several censures.

King Oridanias was wont to say to the Cicilians, that to the sacrificing
Priests of the Temple, most honor was due; whereby it may appear, that the
religious from the beginning were had in reverent estimation: and it was not
given them without some consideration, for as it is recorded, the Priests of
Diana were limited to their several seasons, the first wherein they might
learn wisdom, the second, wherein to exercise it them selves, and the third,
to instruct others* Brias king of Argiues, gave most honor to the Philosophers
that read in schools. Numa Pompilius amongst the Romans, was of opinion, that
he was worthy of most reputation, to whom had happened the victory of any
famous battle and that was fortunate in war.

But Anaxarchus the Philosopher, ordained amongst the Phenitians, that in a
common wealth, such should be especially honored, who in the time of peace
entertained the state in tranquillity; and in the fury of war, was found to be
a valiant protector of the limits and liberties of his country, concurring
with that of Tully, who likewise prefers to the highest degree of honor;
those, who armed do make war, and robbed, do rule and govern the common
wealth: but because this little pause of peace, has even almostlulde us in
that security, that now the soldier has hanged up his armor a rusting by the
walls, they would likewise hang himself a rusting with his Arms, I think it
not amiss therefore to give him a little furbushing, though not to cast him
into any counterfeit color, or so to vernish or gild him, whereby to make him
more bright by Art then he is of himself by Nature: a little therefore to rub
out the canker, that time has already begun for to eat, I will make him as
well as I can, to glister and shine in his own virtue.

War is a minister of Gods justice for sin, God is not the author of ill,
but the chasticer of abuse; he orders the will of Princes to punish or
revenge: the Soldiers as obedient Subjects, are the Minister to perform: if
power were not to maintain Princes proceedinges, the Prince might sometimes
be dispossessed of his Estate; cruel hands would be laid on the Ministry,
yea, the Lawyers would be pulde from the Bar, and the Judge plucked down
from the place of Justice; so that in peace the name of a Soldier restreyneth
the rebellions, and in war, makes subject the proudest resister.

The Soldier refers himself to the will of the prince, the prince is not
disposed but by the direction of God, who since he is the governor of every
actio^, I dare auow they are not vicious.

It may be objected, that in the proud attemptes of Princes, the Soldier is
still present, not respecting the cause so much as his own profit.

This were a hard position to be objected against Lawyers, but the Soldier
being a subject, is tied to follow his Prince: but in injurious enterprises, I
know there are Soldiers, that are as contrary to the war as he that is most
ready to reprehend: who by proof and not by guess, do conclude of the event of
the battle when the cause proceeds from a wrongful ground.

But let us speak of Soldiers in their minorities, when they first become to
be apprentises to Arms. In the choice of a Soldier, we do not only regard
the ability of his body, but the quality of his mind: for if religion,
circumspection, prevention, counsel, experience, zeal, fidelity, resolution,
continency and care, be not in him that should enter the profession, the charge
is ill looked into; neither is such a one to be admitted, that is not thus
accomplished: then if a Soldier of judgment be had, when he is employed, how
lives he in the field? first, in the fear of God, not assured of his life from
one hour to another, surely tied to al virtuous actions, abstinent in diet,
diligent to please, careful to correct, dutiful to obey, tired with travel,
hands, feet, legs, thoughts and all, toyled, occupied, and employed, so that
neither leisure serves him to be idle, nor the severity of his Captain admits
him to run astray: such Soldiers should be, and thus they ought to be
employed, and if there were not some such, the name and title were hardly
bestead.

For those imputations wherewith Soldiers are charged, to be rash, rebellious,
cruel, mutinous, incontinent etc. they are but scandals maliciously imposed:
for first, if they were rash, their success would be more unfortunate, then
commonly it falls out.

If rebellious, and not to be governed, without doubt, Alexander had not
conquered so many countries, subdued so many kingdoms, and overcome so many
nations, and (as it were) but with a handful of his Macedonians and Cretians.

If bloody minded, why then spared Caesar those Senators, and citizens of Rome,
when both by their own hand*writing and often attempts, he well knew to be the
followers of Pompei, and his capital enemies.

If murtherous, how often might the Venetian Armies have worthily spoiled the
whole Island of Create, which not only had murdered many of their families
with the sword, but also rebelled against them five or six several times.

Ifincontinent, what caused Scipio to redeliuer that noble young Virgin, who
for her passing beauty, and great admiration of person, was presented unto him
as a rare gift; Scipio himself amassed at the sight, would yet deliver her to
Luceias, to whom she was espoused, and gave him also for a dowry, the gold
that her parents had brought to redeem her.

If couctous, how fell it out, that after L. Mumius had taken Corinth, and
adorned all Italy with the riches of that spoil, he kept so little to his own
use, that the Senate was feign for very need, to give dowry to his daughter of
the common treasure.

But because Rome has been especially famed, let us see from whence she
attained to her greatness, we shall find that the Soldier was he that defended
the estate, the Soldier was he that made Rome notable: yea, the Soldier was
he that had the creation of the Emperor. When the soldier had this sway,
peace was as plentiful at Rome as after it was, the reuenews of Rome greater
then now they be, the abomination of Rome less then now it is: In the time of
the soldiers government, Rome was renowned for her justice, and was reputed to
be the mistress of the world: now the rule is in the hand of a counterfeit
priest, Rome is insamed for her idolatry, and is accounted the scorn of the
world: In the days of Traian, other countries sought their laws from Rome,
now in the days of the Vicar of Christ, Rome is accounted lawles of all the
world.

In the loss of a soldier, how mourned Julius Caesar? whom not only he
dignified with great honors being alive, but also buried with bitter tears
being dead.

Pompei the great builded the city of Nicopolis to no other end but to harbor
soldiers.

Alexander the Roman, would seldom give gifts unless it were to soldiers,
affirming it to be unlawful for him that was high steward of the common wealth
to convert those revenues which the Provinces did contribute, either to his
own spots and pleasures, either yet to spend and consume them amongst his
friends and favorites.

Yea, the most notable Emperors, that ever yet were heard on, has accounted
of a Soldier as of his familiar, calling him his companion, and fellow in
Arms. Now I have heard of them, that have been learned in the laws, and some
others likewise that have been famous Orators, that have been entertained by
Princes, but never reputed to be their fellows, yet many times accounted to be
their flatterers, to sooth the^ up in their pleasurs, and to follow and uphold
them in their idle humors.

Perhaps, for the maintenance of a good Plea, a lawyer may get a little popular
praise; but the soldier, for subduing an enemy to Rome, had the honor of a
Triumph. I might here enlarge a great deal of other matter fitting to my
purpose: but will you hear what testimony the holy Scriptures will affoorde us
in the commendation of Soldiers? in the 3. of Luke, amongst a number of all
sorts of people that came to John Baptist, as well to hear him preach, as also
to be baptized, the soldiers were not behind, but stired up with the like
godly zeal, they came amonst the rest, desirous to be instructed in the way
of their salvation, and as the other had done before them, they demanded of
John what they might do to inherit heaven; the Prophet rendering no rough
reply, mildly said unto them, Doc no violence, but be content with your pay.

If I should a little paraphrase of this Text I might easily make it appear,
that soldiers are not so puffed up with desire of a little transitory glory,
that they neglect the glory that shall endure world without end.

The Captain again, that sent unto Jesus about helping of his sick servant,
as our Savior was coming toward his house, he was encountered by a second
messenger, acknowledging himself unworthy to receive him under his roof,
beseeching him but only to speak the word, and he knew his servant should be
safe, whereat our Lord himself wondered, and turning him to those that
followed, he said, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

There is yet mention made in the Acts of the Apostles, of Cornelius a
Captain, a devout man, and one that feared God, with all his household, to whom
an Angel appearing, willed him to send to Ioppa for Simon Peter, who should
instruct him, and baptize him in the name of Jesus Christ; and the Captain
called unto him a devout Soldier (for those be the words of the Text) whom
he sent with others, about this message.

This Testimony we have in the new Testament of Soldiers that were godly
inclined: but I do not find mention made of any Lawyer, but of those that
came amongst the Scribes and Pharisees, that sought still to tempt and crucify
Christ, against whom our Savior himself, pronounced, VVoe be to you Lawyers,
for you load men with beauty burdens to be borne: but you your selves will not
touch them with your little fingers.

I have traveled a large circuit, and by what is already past, it might well
enough appear, that he is most beneficial to his Country, whose body
executes what his wisdom plotteth, I might yet hold on a larger journey,
but I think it needles, and therefore I mean to weary my self no further.

But I cannot see what the Lawyer can challenge of his country, the lawyer (I
mean) that makes his plea but for his private profit, whole only
contemplation has but regard to his own cofers.

In the beginning, when Justinians Radices were not known, but the law of the
Tables were taught, then the law was not in the civil magistrate to dispose,
but the Priest had it to propound: that law was delivered by succession, and
confirmed by the presence of the Lawgiver: and whilst that law was continued,
Israel was partaker of the promise; the Heathen fell before them, for the Lord
of hosts was amongst them, but in continuance of time, as sin and corruption
began to increase, the laws likewise began to multiply: for it is offense that
begets laws, and from the wickedness of men, it is that good laws do proceed.

Dionisius of Siracusa (though otherwise a tyrant) yet he made a Law, that
those that excessiuely gave them selves to banqueting, should be punished with
great asperity: Licurgus made a Law against drunkenness, Augustus Caesar against
pompious buildings, the Lucanes against prodigality, the Lacedaemonians against
excess in apparel, the Egyptians against whoredom and adultery, the
Thebians, against negligent parents, that brought up their children in idleness
and insolency, the Romans against those masters, that were too severe and
cruel to their servants; and there was a Law established in Rome, called
Iulia, the tenor whereof was, that no man should be so hardy to shut up his
doors, whilst they were at dinner, that the officers of the City might have the
more easy access to see if their ordinary did not exeede their ability.

I might speak of the laws of Draco, of those that were made by Numa
Pompilius, and of infinite numbers beside that were made by several men at
sondrie times, and for diverse purposes, so that law is but leue*led by
direction, administered by appointment, and still referred to reformation.

This Canon may be anihilated by this learned Doctor, that distinction
frustrated by that Expositor, and what not turned Topsieturuy, to serve the
season for the Lawyers commodity.

There is no agreement amongst themselus, for what they confirm to day, to
morrow they disauow; look into their own Canons, consider of the first
institution of their laws politic, positive, and provincial, and there will
be found so many corrections, so many frustrations, so many anticipations, so
many cauteles, and such several expositions, as the studient had need every
day of a new memory, to consider of his new coated clause. With this
multiplicity of laws, there is likewise crept in such a superaboundance of
Lawyers, that by wresting and corrupting of the laws, do maintain
themselves, their wives and their family, in presumption and pride.

These be they that with Protulus the son of Nerua, by their injurious
cauillations, will destroy the cause of Otho their familiar friend, and will not
let wickedly to betray him to Vitelius for a little gain.

These be they that with Christopher of Castill, have bound themselves
apprentises to variety, and with Eneius Popilius, will know nothing without a
golden Fee.

These be they that with Baldus Perusinas, are as well hated for their
inconstancy, as honored for their learning, and with Saturius (that was never
heard to deliver a profitable sentence in Law) does yet uphold their ambition
by the scrapinges of the law.

These be they that with Hortensius plead hard for Verres, for the fee of a
silver Spinx, and with Augilius Rats will nonsute his Clients cause, if he denay
him but to change a piece of base money.

These be they, by whose corruptions, the laws are made but Traps and Trains,
where by both rich and poor are caught and spoiled, and how many Athenian
Orators have we, that will counterfeit the Squinancy for a little gain, and yet
are to open mouthed against the poor man's process, that will make their plea,
but according to the penny, that will come delays from Term to Term, from
time to time, from year to year, that have so many shifts, and are so full of
collusion, that I protest, I do not know any thing wherein we stand in
greater need, then of provident and godly laws, whereby to curb and restrain
the corruptions of the greatest number of our Lawyers, but especially from the
detestable exactions of those that be Clerks and under officers, that are
cried out upon by poor suitors, for their extorting and taking of unreasonable
fees.

But as I have heard there has been some reformation of these things in
England, and I hope there will be the like had in Ireland, where this extorting
by Clarks, is in such use and custom, that some of the discreet ludges
themselves, have found fault at it, and I my self have heard no worse man
then the Kings Attorney General of that realm that did both (...) nor Judge
to dete mine it, in such a case (by the laws of all nations, the trial is
still referred to the laws of Arms, from a Company of wrangling Advocates,
that with their sophistications do hunt after continual darkness, to the
honorable prescriptions set down by Soldiers, that to discover falsehood, to
bring hidden practices to open light, to make their trials by way of Combat,
presupposing that God, who only knows the secrets of all things, will give
victory to him that aduentureth his life for justice and right.

This supposition is not vainly grounded, for histories are full of examples:
how many ungracious and ungodly practices have been discovered and laid open,
and of many other trials that have been made by those honorable incounters of
Combat, and sometimes determined by Martial court?

But the Soldiers confidence is not to be forgotten, who referring the equity
of his cause to the righteous judgment of God, do neither seek for love, nor
for favor, nor for gain, neither arethey drawn by any manner of corruption,
to obscure matters, to darken them, or to shut them up in a golden cloud: or
after three or four years continuance in suit, to make them more intricate
then they were the very first day they were commenced.

No, the martial law is of a more speedy dispatch, it seeks no corners, it
neither vpholdeth wrong, nor suppresseth right: I may therefore conclude with a
good conscience, that if there be not some difference in the laws themselves,
yet in the administration there is a great inequality.

I would not wish you to belecuc for all this, that I would have all suits, all
quarrels, and all manner of controversies to be tried by martial law: do you
ask me, how I would then have them ended? I protest I will tell you what I
would do my self in such a case; I would walk Powles till I were weary, but
I would meet with him that would say, had don him wrong, or between whom and
my self, there were like to arise any cause of contention or suit in law; and
having once found him, he should be very hard hearted, but I would entice him
to a Tavern, where calling for a potle of wine, and placing it at the upper
end of the Table, I would make it an arbitrator between us for that time, and I
would likewise draw in some other of our friends and acquaintance, that if the
wine should be too hot or too furious in his execution, they should moderate
and qualify his rigor with some indifferency: you know my meaning, if it were
a matter of a thousand pounds weight, I had rather abide a trial amonst
neighbors and friends, (that might make a quick dispatch) and a quiet end,
then to follow a suit at Westminster Hall, that will scarce be finished in an
age, especially, if the matter be doubtful or intricate. To conclude, I would
not wish a wise man to go to Law at all, if it were possible; marry, if there
be no remedy, arm your self with patience, and store your purse with
crowns; for be sure, you shall have occasion to use both the one and the
other: for the Lawyer and the Vintner too, are very costly if they be well
followed, and they do both of them make their greatest gainby selling of the
Elements, for the one sels water, and the other sels wind; but caveat Emptor,
for he that sels wine, though it be but by the pint, will game more at the
years end, then he that buys it by the pottle: but he that lives by venting
of law, woe be to the buyer, for they retaile such rotten stuff, they will
make you pay for the very dregs and dross of their law; they sell the very
parings, the scraping, and the of^courings of the law at unreasonable rates:
you shall pay for every leaf, for every line, for every word, for every
syllable, for every scrape, for every dash with a pen, for every drop of
ink; you shall pay for their toying, for their trifling, for their delaying,
sometimes for their lying; you must attend at their chambers, you must wait for
them at their study doors, you must be sure to have their fees in readiness,
for he that wants money amongst Lawyers, is like a flower in the Frost, nipt in
one night, and withered the next day.

Cato seeing the inconvenience that grew in the common wealth by the
provocation of Lawyers, that animated and maintained dishonest suits and
quarrels amongst neighbors and friends; wished that the courts of Pleas might
be set with trappes and ingines, to catch and insnarle the professors of that
study of law: and Fardinando sending a vyz-Roy into the Indies then newly
discovered, he forbad him to carry any Lawyers with him, to the end they might
not sow the seeds of suits.

I hope I shall not be mistaken (by those that are wise) nor my words
construed to the worst meaning (by those that are honest) for I am not ignorant
of many worthy Gentlemen that are professors of the law, and I think both
the study and administration of law, to be most befitting and behouefull for
Gentlemen: for what are they but this base borne brood, that creeping into the
Innes of Court, and having a little scraped together a few fragments and
scrapings of the law, because they would not mend shoos, foot stockinges, drive
the cart, and do as their fathers did before them; they neither care what laws
they pervert, nor what Clients they consume; these be they against whom I have
all this while whetted my pen; with others I have not had to deal.

For the grave and reverent Judges, Fathers and Founders of the Law, my pen
has not touched, no, far be it from me to think an evil thought, much less
to detect them. There be many other Gentlemen, both of name and blood that I
know are not to be detected; amongst the which, some I love for their honesty,
some I reverence for their quality, and some I honor for their excellency many
ways expressed, but especially in their lives: amongst the rest that are now
remainant in the realm of Ireland, one that has made himself more famous
then the rest, and therefore above the rest in that Region most worthy so to be
famed. I need not blaze his name, for he that has but learned to know
himself, has heard of him. I might say more but I need not, for he has said
more for himself then I am able to say.

For a full conclusion of this, I protest, that I do not know any man in
England, a professor of the law, either one or other that I do malice; there be
a number that I do love, and I love them for their own virtue and worthiness:
neither can I speak any ill of any one particular person amongst them of mine
own experience; neither have I heard the abuses of these pettyfogging fellows
more bitterly reprehended, then I have heard amongst Lawyers themselves that
are of the most worthiest sort, and best learned in the laws.

And now to return to the subject that I have taken in hand, I say it is the
best gentry that is attained by Arms or by learning, but best of all by both,
and he does hardly deserve the title of a Gentleman, that is not advanced by
one or both; they are far deceived to think, that a little wealth, or a bare
office, may make a man worthy of estimation, that is not attained unto by
desert, or accomplished by virtue: to gain a reputation, to be accounted wise
or virtuous, many wise and virtuous acts are required; but for a man to make
himself to be esteemed for a fool, one foolish act suffices: and therefore
a man had need to take heed how he marries a wife, that is of the flanting
humor.

Some do think to aspite to gentility by their wealth, but that were a base
foundation, for riches are most commonly heaped together by corruptions, by
extortions by exactions, by oppressions, and by many other like, servile
functions.

And a man would laugh to hear some of these Hogelings (if they be in
company) what they will attribute to themselves, you shall see a fellow that
was but lately digde out of a dung hill, whose wit and honesty both, does only
consist but in compassing of crowns; that will take more state upon him, then
he that is able to manage a princes Army in the field.

Some others do think, that the greatest grace of gentility does consist in
gaudy shows, in foolish fashions, and to be like Protenus the God of shapes.
Some their greatest virtue is, to pour it in, and to put it out again: some
do think to be registered in the Heraldes books, for wearing hair of the
new cut, one will have it short, another will have it long, an other will have
his love lock, or his lady lock, (or call it what you will) that shall hang
dangling by his ear, an excellent place of Ambuscado, to sheltre Nits and Lice.

There be some* that in their actions do affect honor, who in their ambition
will protest of great wonders, and what they would bring to pass, if they had
been borne mighty, which sort of men are commonly much talked of, but little
cared for, when honor does best show her self in him, that does rather seek
merit; then hunt after fame; yet I have known of some of these aspiring
potentates, that were ashamed to confess their own parentage, but would
challenge their alliance from some Lord, or from some knight, like the Mule
that being demanded of his birth, being ashamed to confess that he was the
son of an Ass; answered that he was cosen German to a Horse. In every well
governed common wealth, men of learning, virtue and honesty are advanced and
preferred, for dignity in an unworthy person, is like a precious stone, that is
set in base mettell, or like a rusty rapier in a velvet scaberd: but opinion is
a perilous fellow, and I think there is not a more cosening thing in the
world, for it deceyueth Kings, Princes, Dukes, Earls, Lords, and what is he
that is not over reached by opinion?

It draws most to great fortunes, and it is bred and fostered by the breath
of the vulgar.

It prefers men to dignities, to offices and places of authority as well in
the time of peace, as in the time of war, for where opinion bears sway,
she rules like a God, she makes fools to be reputed wise, cowards to be
called courageous, and silly ignorant men to be admired for judgment and skill.

Opinion is a burre that still cleaves to the mighty, and it is more nice and
foolish to please, then judgment.

Opinion is the mother of hypocrisy, it is blind, it is lame, it is self
conceited, and it has prevailed so far that we want but another Erasmus to
deifie Opinion, as one has already writ in the praise of Folly.

Opinion is most smoothed by those that do affect and hunt after it
themselves, and that is commonly by men of the basest condition, by such as do
thirst after promotion, as tale bearers, news carriers, and such other; and
some too think to creep into the very guts of Opinion, with drinking a
health; some to win Opinion, are excellent in discourse at a table, they will
talk of their own actiuity, how many fraies they made in Fleetstreet, what
Ladies and Gentlewomen came to visit them when they lay sick of the toothach,
and they will sometimes vaunt of a favor from their mistres, that were scorned
by the maid: and bar them from this or other like talk, and they are as
utterly unfurnished as a chimnies end in a country house without a pudding, or
a piece of bacon. I have seen some of these fellows that are of the ietting
behavior, that do think to reach at opinion by complements and quaint
devises, that will dispute of intricate matters, that profess to be seen in
all faculties, that will speak by distinct spaces, and will refute all men by
innovation of Method, that can sometimes speak well, and always live ill.

He that swaggereth and swears, and speaks not a word, but it is full of
terror, that threatens the stabbe or some other deadly blow, that is able to
dismember a man with the very breath of his displeasure, that can shake him
all to tatters, but upon the point of his tongue, that is as fearful to
behold, as the Gentleman that durst not look in a glass when he was angry,
for affrighting himself with the terror of his own countenance, that scorneth
to cut up the Goose-pie, that scorneth to drink to him that will not pledge
him a full cup, that scorneth sometime to pay his debts; all this and more
too, is, but to win opinion, and so from thence to step to preferment.

I never found less performance in deeds, then in some of these prating
fellows, that are so full of words; but for my part if I hit into their
company, when I hear their tongues begin to wagge, I listen to their talk,
as I listen to a Bagge-pipe, that the louder it squeyles, the more abject I
hold the music.

Now for this insinuating baseness that does woo preferment, as if she were a
wench to be won with presents, with praises, and with flattery; a fair
word, a smiling look, or a flattering show, were recompense good enough for
those creatures of servitude.

For mine own part, I have ever scornd to purchase reputation, or to seek
advancement, by ducking, by crowching, by deiecting and prostrating my self at
men's feet, to submit to a voluntary professed servitude, to dance attendance,
sometimes three hours by the clock, and then to be blessed with a Nod,
commend it he that list, I cannot like it, neither do I love to commit the
idolatry of out age, to make mortal men saints, to worship, to adore, to
creep, to crouch, and to make offerings: if any of these interpreting fellows
will say, I stand too much in my own conceit, and therefore (perhaps) will
not stick to break a jest or two behind my back, to get the start of such
deprauers (and a little to prevent them) I befoole him a fore hand, that does
think me so simple, as not to be able to distinguish between servile
flattery and beseeming courtesy; but to submit my self to a base kind of
submission, to beg a little preferment: let them win that way those that
list, I hold the gain to be more abject and base, then Vespasians gain gotten
by vtine:

But of all fortunes that might befall me, it would anger me to the heart, to
creep into an office (yea, if it were into Knighthood it self*) more for my
wives sake, then for mine own worth.

I will speak no more of my self: but what indirect aspiring is this, that to
attain to a little title of dignity, we shall make our selves to be laughing
stocks, and to be holden contemptible in seeking a dignity, not being able to
uphold the reputation of the place?

It is a counterfeit fashion to face the outside with a little satin, or some
other like stuff of a glorious show, and to patch and piece the inside with
tatters and rags of little worth: me thinks there be some, that if they did
but examine and look into their own dignities, they should be very angry,
because they should find them to look with squint eyes, wrie mouths, and
flearing countenance, as though they derided and mocked at their masters.

This eye beguiling glory deceives none but fools and it is like the
Gloweworme, that shines a little in the dark, but in the light of the day,
we discern it to be but a paltry worm.

I have hitherto but spoke of Gentlemen, that do not know their own places,
nor many times how to martial themselves but with disorder, iniuring and
wronging others, and some of them with such unreasonable presumption as might
turn to offense, and so to a quarrel; I hold it not unnecessary now
(according to my promise) to say something of Knights, amongst whom (if there
be not some mistaking by the Heralds) there is some inequality and difference
between them.

The time has been, when the Yeomandry of England did flourish, and were had
in some account, but after the proverb began to grow in custom. That every
lack would be a Gentleman, our Yeomandry began to faint, and even then to
decay, and now our Gentlemen are as far out of date, and this second proverb
approved to be in full strength and virtue, that is, Either a Knight or a
knitter of Caps: for we are now so full of Knights, that Gentlemen are had in
little request: the order of knighthood is ancient, and the dignity in ages
past, has been accounted honorable, neither was it given but to such as were
able to countenance the place and had ability (both of wealth and wit) to
gratify their country, to benefit the common wealth, yea and to be aiders and
assistants to princes in all their affairs, either in the time of peace, or in
the time of war.

Such they have been, and some such there be still, but amongst them there be
as unworthy, as the others are worthy, and here is the difference and
inequality between them.

The one are known by their troops of servants, that are attendant and
waiting upon them; the other are known by a poor Page or Lackey, or if they
ca^ get a pild fellow or two in a thread bare Liuerie, it is a greater train
then some of their Fathers, or other of their predecessors before them were
able to maintain.

The one are known by their hospitality and good housekeeping, as well in the
City as in the Country, the other are known by their frequent to other men's
tables, that are not able to give a meals meat, nor scarsly to eat a good
one (at their own costs and charges) from one Sunday to another.

The one are known by the authority and government they bear in the common
wealth, and are advanced for their wisdom, and renowned by their own desert,
the other are better known for their wives vanity, then for their own virtue,
and not so much advanced for their own wit, as for their wives wantonness. To be
short, the one are beloved of all for their wisdom, and the other are scorned
of al for their folly. I cannot tell whether it be an inconvenience to a common
wealth, to have so many unworthy persons puffed up into prid^; but this I
answer, that a great number of the unable sort must uphold their pride, either
by begging from the prince, or by shifting or scambling in the common wealth:
for sir Giles himself must have his satin suite, and my good Lady his wife,
must needs have her Coach, for to see a Lady to walk the streets without a
Coatch, is like my Lord Mayor, when he comes from Westminster without a
Pageant, or like a Shroue Tuesday without a pancake.

For as Knights grow poor, so Ladies grow proud, and when a Lady is out of
the new Fashion she is like a ship that is out of Trim, she will never
steare well.

The Romans would never admit any man to carry the name either of knight or
gentleman, that had not served in the wars, neither would they dignifie any
man with any of those titles, but such as had been famed for their service in
the field, or otherwise commended for some excellent virtue: me thinks it were
well if this were observed in the institution of knights, and that as good
respect might be had to their ability of wealth, as to their ability of wit, and
although I do here yoke wealth with virtue, yet I do make wealth to be but the
handmaid to virtue, for the exercise of liberality is many times as necessary
for a knight as chiualry: but now we shall sooner meet with sir Dinnaden or sir
Dagonet at a dinner, then sir Lancelot du Lake, or sir Trustrum de Liones in
the field.

Some do hold, that amongst Knights, he is to have the first place, that had
his first creation, and this is it that I have labored all this while to
impugn: for what a disparagement were this, that a man that were first by
birth a Gentleman descended of worthy parents, trained and fostered up from his
very infancy in knowledge and understanding, that is of able reuenew to keep
hospitality, and to relieve the poorer sort that are inhabiting about him,
whose wisdom and experience has been both tried and well approved, in his
love and service shown, as well to his Prince as to his country, and such a one
being worthily dignified to the order of knighthood, for his virtue and well
deserving, another that is but base by birth, compassed (perhaps) with some
measur of wealth but not with an inch of wit; some of them not greatly
pestered, neither with wealth nor wit, his best complements, a little pride and
a great deal of ignorance) yet one of these little worthy creatures, creeping
into a knighthood, whether by favor, whether by fortune perhaps by fraud, but
I am sure, neither by merit nor by desert, should yet shoulder the other from
the wall, because he had his creation an hour or two before him.

I could here find in my heart to chide (and that extremely) but especially in
the behalf of Ladies, I mean of those Ladies that may be said to be truly
legitimate: for there be of Ladies, as there be of knights, some in
substance, and some in show: but for those that be Ladies as well in nature as
by name, I reverence those, nay I honor them, and although I know their
virtuous inclination to be more ready to pardon, then willing to revenge, yet
what gentle spirit would not be grieved in their behalfes, to see a base borne
Madam, whose mother would have been glad to have been a good Ladies Landres,
and yet she will pranke and perch, yea and sometimes contend with her for
place and superiority, that has had her betters to attend her in her chamber.
I did once know one of these femall kind, that the best bringing up she had
whilst she dwelt with her own mother (I think) was to study the Art of
Navigations: she had daily frequent amongst Sailors and Seafaring men* and in
continuance of time she fell to practice the Jacobs staff: and I durst be
sworn, she never so much as dreamte of a Ladyship, but fortune (they say) is
blind and she always favors fools. The Proverb may be true, for we have
some knights in this age that are not accounted the wisest men, and amongst
them she was Ladyfied, and very shortly after that she was numbered in this
society to become a fellow Lady: she began to scorn this excrement of worms,
this satin, silk and velvet were to mean for my Ladies wearing, unless it
were decked, guarded and garnished with the mineral of gold, silver and other
ornaments of more pure and precious nature.

Martial makes mention of one of these base born brats called Poppeia, that
after she became a concubine to Nero, had her horses shod with pure gold: I
would be ashamed of it, but I would match Poppeias pride with as base borne as
her self, if I listed to pick out presidents, though not in shooing of horses
with gold* yet in other superfluous vanities, no less nice and foolish then
that: but let them pass, and thus I will conclude, that as there is no
ambition so violent, as that of the Beggars, so there is no pride to be
compared to the pride of one of these abject creatures, that is exalted and
lifted up from a base estate to a little prosperity.

But now to speak of knights, I say that the dignity was at the beginning
given for service in the field, and was proper only to martial men, for there
was the first institution, but since it has grown by custom, that every
absolute Prince has power to bestow that dignity as well in the time of peace,
as in the time of war, but yet knights are of the more or less reputation,
according to the quality of the Prince, or party that gives the creation, for
this is the opinion of the Heraldes, the Venetian estate, and the state of
Genoa, do take upon them to make Knights, and so does the Pope; but with these
we will not meddle.

In the time of the first institution, the creation was performed with many
ceremonies, and as many ceremonies again were used in the degradatio^ of a
knight. There are three or four sundry orders of knights in England, but I
will only speak of those that have neither garment badge, sign nor show
whereby to be known from other ordinary Gentlemen, but by the addition of sir
John, sir Thomas, sir Richard, or sir Robert, by which notes they are better
known amongst our selves then they are to strangers, and these knights are
called by the Heraldes, knights Batchelers.

These knights are made either by the king himself or by his commission and
royal authority to his liuetenant, especially in the time of war, who has
his royal and absolute power for the instant.

This order is given upon diverse considerations, whereof the principal is for
service in the field, and to these especially belongs the greatest honor,
and ought to take the first place, for I have known, (and I have sometimes
seen) both Earls and Barons, that have received the order of knighthood in the
field, and have thought themselves thereby to be dignified: for as the beuty of
every common wealth consists in the virtue of their Nobility, so the wings of
true Nobility, wherewith to make her to fly hie, are the deeds of chiualry, for
being enlightened with martial skill, it makes him to shine more clear and
bright.

In the time of Peace, the dignity of knighthood is bestowed of many worthy
Gentlemen, who for their wisdom and ability every way, are fit to sway and
govern in the common wealth, and these knights are worthily honored, and are
so to be reputed and regarded.

After these in the third rank, let them march in Gods name, whom the prince
himself does advance (perhaps) in hope of their future service, or for any
other respect or consideration (whatsoever) for it well beseems a king to make
a knight (though it be but for his pleasur) because a prince may give him
maintenance to hold his estate, as he gave him Knighthood at his pleasure,
whither any substitute may do the like, I will not dispute, for if he makes a
Knight for his pleasure that is unable, either he makes a Beggar, that must be
still craving of the Prince, or such a burden, that of necessity, must be a
pester to the common wealth, for those knights that are but poor, bare and
needy, are like ciphers that do make figures rich, but are themselves worth
nothing.

I am sorry now at last to speak of those that are a stayne to that honorable
order of Knighthood, that knowing themselves to be of no desert, nor any ways
able to merit, will buy the dignity and purchase their knighthood with money,
a silly humor that loves admiration, and procures laughter.

I have known of these betrayers of virtue, that when he had made his purchase
of a knighthood, the best that he was able after to perform, was to take a
place at the upper end of the Table, and all the virtue that was in him beside,
was this, he loved to pay the Fiddlers.

I might enlarge a great deal of other matter about this contending and
striving for places, this standing upon precedence and superiority, who is
better, and who is worse, but to him that is not partial, it might very well
appear, that as well amongst Noble men, as amongst Knights and Gentlemen, the
martial man is first to be preferred, yea amongst Emperors, kings and
princes, he is ever holden to be most magnificent, that is most martial: and
this is not mine, but the opinion of the Heraldes.

Now for a number of counterfeit Soldiers, that will be called Captains, some
of them that never had charge, unless (perhaps) at the fetching home of a
Maypole, or sometimes preferred more for favor then for any ability that was
in them, unless to lead men to the slaughter.

Some other again that have been a littleat the sea, a pilfering, that for
the service, or what belongs to the sea, are more simple and ignorant then
the poor ship boy, and these be they that are a slander and disgrace to the
Art Militari, for there is no greater inciuility, no baser disorder, nor more
shameful misdeameanor, then is used by these counterfeit Soldiers that do
march under the title of Captains.

But what profession is free from counterfeites, when Divinity it self is
sometimes made but a cloak for hipocrites: And here if I might but crave a
little license, I might speak of a kind and manner of affinity, that is
between the Divine and the Soldier, sympathizing and concurring so nearly
together, that both their virtues and their vices might be said to be a
kin, and to have proceeding from one original: they are both warriors, the
one with the word, the other with the sword: the one fighting against the pride
of sin, and against all enemies ghostly and spiritual: the other fighting
against the ambition of Tirants and against all other oppressors, either
foreign or domestical. A good Captain must have training, practice and
experience, before he take upon him to conduct in the service of his Prince:
a godly Divine must have learning, wisdom and knowledge, before he take upon
him the cure of souls in the church of God.

The unskillful Captain but leads men to the slaughter: the ignorant Divine
leads souls to destruction.

A good Captain, fearing the attempts, and sudden surprises of the enemy, is
still vigilant and watchful: A good Divine fearing the creeping in of vice,
and the hot Alarmes of sin is ever ready to make resistance.

The Captain that sometimes buyeth his company and attaineth to his charge
more by favor of friends then by his own virtue, is more ready to poul and
pill his Soldiers, then to perform any service; the Divine that creeps into
a Benefice by sinister practice, more for the love of the living, then for love
of the living God, will sooner fleece his flock then feed it and will be
more ready to contend with his parishioners for those duties that are
appertaining to himself, then to teach and instruct the^ in those duties that
they owe unto God. Those Captains that are too formal and in the prescribing
of martial Discipline, are more nice then necessary, are the disturbers of the
love and amity that should be amongst Soldiers, and do many times hinder the
expedition of service that might be performed: those Deuines that are more
precise in the ceremonies of the Church then the word it self does warrant,
are the seeds men of dissension, and by their too much curiosity, they set
abroach those strifes and contentions, that are lets and hindrances to many
godly proceedings that might benefit the church.

The careless Captain suffers his Soldiers to spoil to rob, to steal, to
bring in booties, as well from friends as foes, he cares not from whom, so he
may have his share; the covetous Divine suffers his flock to wander in
blindness, to follow idolatry, and to rob God of his glory, he cares not how,
so it brings in beeues to his kitchen, horse to his stable, and money to his
cofers.

I might be infinite in this comparison, but let it rest: and to conclude (I
say) they are most detestable vices, that are most desirous to look like
virtues.

An Heretic of good life (says Origin) is much more hurtful, and has more
authority in his words, then he that does discredit his doctrine with the
lewdnes of his life, we must therefore take heed of Papists that are of godly
conversation to the show.

The holy Hipocrite is more to be feared, then the Publican or Harlot, yet
beware of a woman, that has once marked her self with infamy, let her
afterward pretend never so much honesty. I dare not undertake to write an
Apology in defense of his wit, that in despite of gray hayres and wisdom
too, will entangle himself with one of those marked creatures; but she may
bring him children, and teach him to sing with the summer bird, I might have
lived merrily, if I had loved never.

But to conclude the Text that I have taken in hand; we contend about
precedence and superiority, we strive who shall go before, and who shall
follow after, and we do all make semblance to hunt after honor, but in truth
we hunt contrary, and missing the right tract where honor is to be found, we
content our selves with a little vain glory; but it fitteth the time, and
letit do so still, for there is no amendment, the world (I see) is grown to
be like Friar Bacons brazen head: The time is past, and there is no hope of
recovery.

Christ sweateth blood, whilst we snort and sleep; Christ wrastleth and
ftriueth with the world, whilst we stand by, and give him the looking on;
Christ has humbled himself to the Cross, we dispute of dignities, who shall
sit on the right hand, who on the left, who shall go before, and who shall
follow after: we are lifted up in our own conceits, we swell with pride and
presumption, the one of us against the other, we misspend this treasure of
time, which God in his mercy has given unto us, this blessed season of peace,
which by a gracious government we now enjoy, which should be converted to
better use and purpose.

In the time of peace, Philosophy has his peculiar exercise: and when we are
exempt from the trouble of war, it is then time to settle religion, to
establish laws, and execute justice, to endeavor the knowledge of Arts, and
Sciences, and in the time of peace, it is the^ high time to provide for war.

FINIS.
