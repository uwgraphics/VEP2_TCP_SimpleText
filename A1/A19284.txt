TO THE HIGH and excellent Princess, Elizabeth, eldest daughter to our
Sovereign Lord King JAMES.
MOST gracious Princess; vouchsafe (I beseech you) the remembrance of that
duty, which we owe unto God for all his benefits; namely, to take up the cup of
salvation and call upon the name of the Lord. This is the subject of this small
Treatise. Which I am the rather emboldened to present unto your grace, because,
as the Lord has renewed his mercies continually upon your princely person,
especially showed himself merueilous in that your admirable deliverance from
these bloody hunters: so it pleased your highness to accept very favorably the
remembrance thereof, and to patronage my first labors (to that end) with the
prime of your Graces protection: which as it has the rather bound me to
consecrate my self and al my studies to your Graces devotion; so do I in all
humble manner tender unto your Excellency, a pledge hereof in these short
meditations; which as they may be your daily practice of thankefulnes to God
for all his mercies toward you: so will they also prove very profitable
directions for the information of your tender years in the ways of God: that
so being daily crowned with new blessing, you may at length be fitted for that
crown of glory, which the Lord Jesus has purchased for you. To whose blessed
protection I do most heartily commend your Highness: and so most humbly take my
leave.

Your Graces most affectionate in all duty, Tho. Cooper.

TO THE RGIHT Honorable the Lord Harington, and his virtuous Lady.
RIGHT Honorable, the princely charge that the Lord has honored your elder
years withal, that your age may be a crown of glory, being found in the
way of righteousness, as it has laid upon your Honors, a greater care for
the discharge thereof: so has it provoked also those (who as in private they
wish your well-fares, so especially, they desire your happy sucesse in that
public Charge, as being in all hearty loyalty obliged thereto: These, I say,
have bin stirred up to devise all holy and profitable means whereby your
Charge may be more Honorable, and your care more comfortable. Among whom,
seeing it has pleased your Honors formerlie to accept of me, and daily to
bind me thereto by renewed favors I have therefore endeavored to testify the
hearty continuance of my duty toward your Honors in this Brief of holy
rules, and instructions, which I have been bold to dedicate to the hopeful,
and happy days of your Gracious Charge: not therein presuming to teach your
Honor what you should do: but rather proposing the same as a Glass, wherein
you may view, what you have done well; and so both to encourage your Honors in
a happy proceeding, and to give you sound comfort in the good success
thereof: which as I shall not cease to pray daily unto the Almighty for; so I
do most humbly beseech your Honors thus to conceive of my endeavors, and to
continue, as you do, the true paterns of virtuous nobility, and the Honorable
patrons of religion and learning. And so I most heartily commend your Honors to
the grace of God.

Your Honors to command in all love and duty, Tho. Cooper.

To the Christian Reader, grace and peace.
THE many Greenham. Perkin^. Rogers. Downam. and Arthur Dent, etc.
excellent treatises and larger discourses concerning the power of godliness,
which it has pleased the Lord of glory to furnish his Church withal in these
last days; as they have made good the faithfulness of our God unto us of this
Church of England, so if they shall not be a witness against us, do they
necessarily require the right use thereof, that we be transformed into the same
image from glory to glory. And therefore howsoever it may seem both
needelesse and prejudicial after so many grave, and experimental rules
concerning sanctification, to add any more in this kind: yet seeing it has
pleased God to direct me to a further labor herein, weigh with me I pray thee
in equity these reasons hereof:

First I do hereby profess my thankefulnes unto God for those excellent
labors of his Saints that now rest from their labors and their fruits follow
them.

Secondly, I would have thee know that I am not ashamed of this foolishnes of
preaching and practick Divinity, which is such a mystery to the world, and
stumbling block unto the wisdom thereof.

Thirdly, Howsoever I do profess that I am not able to attain such
perfection, as I have herein conceined, yet I would have thee know further,
that I would rather have a rule to condemn sin in the flesh, and so confound
the old man, that thereby the new man may follow hard after the mark, then not
to give testimony to that ligh^ which has shined so graciously unto me, then
to conceal my judgment, though it may condemn the practice.

Fourthly, May it please thee to consider with me: Can a man walk in the
sun, and not be warm, and where twolie together, will there not be heat? and
can the light be hidden, nay, ought it to be hidden?

5 Can we do less in these days then convince a profane world?

6 Can we do better then strengthen that which is ready to die?

7 Shall not Gods remembrancers renew their strength, when the devils
instruments do so rage with all licentiousnes?

8 Do we not justify the good by seeking out their ways?

9 Should we not discourage the wicked by making a good profession?

10 Owe we not this duty to our mother?

11 Shall not this redound to the glory of God?

Let this content thee: and provoke thee to make use of these labors, and the
Lord give thee understanding in all things: that thou may try the Spirits,
and hereby thine own, whether thou art in the faith or no, and so for ever
may follow the true Shepherd. To whose blessed protection I do most heartily
commend thee.

THE CHRISTIans daily Sacrifice.
CHAP. I.
FIRST, Of man and his*
God made al things for his glory, but especially Man, Pro. 16. 3. 1. Co. 10.
31. in whom is discovered 1. The greatness of his justice. 2. The riches of his
mercy. Romans 9. 22.


Secondly, Man glorifieth God in a fourefold estate of his, 1. Creation. 2.
Fall. 3. Redemption. 4. Glorification.


Thirdly, The Lord from everlasting so decreed concerning mankind, that the
greater part thereof should be condemned, and but a remnant saved. And to this
end created he man. Creation.
Romans 9. 28. Mat. 7. 13.

Fourthly, Man was created after the image of God in a most perfect estate of
holiness: wherein he glorified God in absolute conformity to him, yet subject
unto change: which also made for Gods glory. Genesis 1. 27.

Fifthly, Fall.
The Lord ordained the Fall of man, and therefore his estate was mutable, that
so his fall might be from himself: that God might make a way for the
manifestation of the glory of his mercy and justice, in the execution of his
decree, concerning the salvation of the elect, and condemnation of the
reprobate; by such means as from all eternity the Lord had sealed thereunto;
and thereupon man fell. Genesis ^. 6.

Sixthly, Man having received an estate for himself, and his posterity, by his
fall utterly deprived himself and all his issue of Gods favor, and the fruit
thereof, the right and possession of heaven and earth: and plunged himself and
all his posterity into a most woeful bondage of sin and Satan. Ge. 2. 17. To.
6. 12.

Seventhly, Redemption.
The fall of man made a way to the work of Redemption which was performed by
Jesus Christ.

Eighthly, Christ Jesus was first, decreed from all eternity: secondly, promised
immediately after the fall of Adam: thirdly, exhibited in the fulness of time,
to perform a full redemption for us. Gal. 4. 4. Genesis 3.

Ninthly, Our redemption by Christ, is either performed or applied.

Tenthly, Christ Jesus performed our redemption: How it was performed.
first, by obedience. And that

1. To God his Father in coming to redeem us.

2. In taking our nature upon him.

3. To the Law in fulfilling it perfectly, which we had broken.

4. In undergoing the punishment when he had fulfilled the Law.

And by these his sufferings our redemption was secondly wrought out.

These sufferings of Christ: were

First, either in his whole li^e such miseries as sin had drawn upon us,
that so he might sanctify them unto us, as hunger, cold, etc. Heb. 2. 18. Heb.
4. 15.

Secondly, Or at his death, such pains as we had deserved, and here he
suffered,

First, in his body as 1. preparations to death.

1. Buffetings by the Soldiers. Mat. 27. and 28. 2. Whipping, and scourging.
3. Crowning with Thorns. 4. Carrying of his Cross. 5. Nayling to the Cross.
Ioh. 19.
Secondly, death it self: here consider,

1 The ignominious manner, upon the cursed tree. Gal. 3.

2 The cruelty used upon his dead body, as being pierced to the heart by that
merciless Soldier. Ioh. 19 34.

3 His ignominious burial, and detaining for three days in the grave. These
were his sufferings in body.

Secondly, he also suffered for us in his soul, and that 1. In his whole life.

1 Grief for the sin of the world, and especially of his own countrymen who
refused him. Ioh. 1.

2 The mockings of the wicked and treachery of his own was no small anguish
unto him. Especially at his death, as

First, that he was betrayed by Judas his own disciple. Luke 22. 48.

2 His agony in the garden where he sweat water and blood, in great abundance.
Luke 22.

3 His trouble in soul. Ioh. 12. 7.

4 The withdrawing of the assistance of the Deity for the present. Phil. 2. 8.

5 The curse of God upon him for man's sin, Gal. 3. 10.

6 The power of Satan prevailing for a time.

7 The horror of being overwhelmed with the heavy wrath of God. Heb. 5. 7.

8 His detaining under the sorrows of death. Acts. 2. 24.

All these, Christ Jesus our redeemer suffered in his humane nature, but they
were accompanied with the merit and efficacy of the divine nature, the dignity
whereof enabled them hereunto, and made them meritorious for our salvation.

Now because it was not possible that the Son of God should be holden of the
sorrows of death; for then had he not been justified and acquitted from our
sins: therefore by the power of his Godhead he raised up himse^fe, and so
accomplished yet further the work of our redemption. Romans 4. 25. Act. 2. 24.

And so Christ Jesus our redeemer obtained a glorious conquest by his
resurrection from the dead: and that

First, Over the Law in abolishing the dominion and rigor thereof.

Secondly, Over Satan and H^ll, chaining up Satan and destroying for ever the
powers of hell. 1. Co. 15. 57.

Thirdly, Over sin, and that

1 in taking away the sting and guiltines thereof.

2 Abating the rage and fury of the same. Romans 7 24. 25.

3 Healing in some measure the corrupt fountain of the same.

4 Weal^^ng the force and daily eating out the very corruption thereof. Romans
6. 12. 3.

Fourthly, death is also conquered and subdued; and that,

1 By taking away the sting thereof.

2 By destroying the dominion of the same. Romans 5. 14.

3 Sanctifying it to the Godly, to whom it is the gate to everlasting life. 1.
These. 4.

4 Raising up our flesh from the grave. 1. Cor. 15.

And thus by this glorious conquest of our Captain Jesus Christ, is recovered
unto us, Heb. 12. 2.

First, The Benenefit of our redemption.
The favor of God our Father, whose children we are now become in Jesus
Christ. 2. Cor. 5. 18. 1. John 3. 1. Colos. 1. 20.

Secondly, The fruits of this favor, which are

1 Faith in the son of GOD, whereby being justified before God we have,

2 Peace of conscience with God and man. 1. Romans 5. 1. Romans 7. 4.

3 Joy unspeakable in the holy Ghost. 1. Pet. 1. 8.

4 We become fruitful in all good works, and so thereby become meet
partakers. Colos. 1. 12.

5 Of salvation.

The earnest whereof we have in this life: first by the inward testimony of
the spirit. ^. Cor. 1. Ephesians. 4.

Secondly, By our outward similitude and conformity to our head Christ Jesus,
being changed into the same Image from glory to glory as by the spirit of the
Lord. 2. Cor. 3. 18.

And we shall fully enjoy it in the life to come, where shall be

1 Ceasing of all sin and sorrow. Revel. 7. 17.

2 Perfect righteousness and holiness. Ephesians. 5. 27.

3 Fulness of joy. Psalm. 16.

4 Immediate fruition and conjunction with God. 1. Cor. 13. 12.

5 Eternity of happiness, and bliffe for evermore. ^. Pet. 1 4.

All these has the Son of God purchased for us.

The means whereby all these are made ours, The application of this benefit by
Faith.
is Faith.

This Faith is wrought in us by the preaching of the word. Romans 10. 17.

And that first of the Law.

First, Discovering our misery, unto us in particular, both

1 From what a blessed estate we are fallen, Roman. 3. Roman. 7. as also

Into what a woeful and desperate condition we are now plunged, not only by
reason of our sin:

Being able to do nothing but displease God. Genesis 6. 5.

And that in regard

1 Of the transgression of Adam, which lies upon us. Romans 5.

2 The fruit of this transgression, even a general infection and corruption
of all the powers and faculties of soul and body.

1 Of the understanding, filled with blindness, and darkness and not savoring the
things of God. Ephesians. 4 17

2 The Conscience wounded, seared, defiled, never soundly peaceable. Timot 4.
1. Corinthians. 1. 2: Esaias 57. 1.

3 The memory fit to retain evil, and to forget good. Heb. 10 22.

4 The will captiuated to evil, and yet running headlong thereto, but to do
good altogether auerse. Romans 8. 5, 6.

5. And so the affections led violently after the sway thereof, as also

6 The conversation most loathsome to God and man. 1. Tim. 1. 15.

7 The thoughts impotent and insatiable to evil, and infinite therein.

8 His best actions, greatest abominations. Pr. 28 9. Io. 9 3^ Ps 50 16.

A second part of man's misery, is the fruit of his ^inne,

Namely; that

First, He is most odious to God and most justly accursed of him, Col. 1. 21.
and this curse is manifest,

First, Upon his body by those fearful and inumerable plagues, diseas^s,
judgments of famine, etc. which he upon men and consume the^ in this life.
D^u. 28 15. Ge 3. 17.

Secondly, By that horrible abuse of Gods blessings, which are bestowed on him:
making the creature to groan under this bondage of corruption, and so to
increase the score against the life to come. Romans 8. 19.

Secondly, Upon his soul, and that ^^st in this life:

1 In being given up to a reprobate sense. Romans 1. 23.

2 Deprived of the knowledge of God, but so far as shall make him without
excuse. Psalm 49. 15.

3 To be past feeling through the hardness of his heart. Ephesians. 4. 19.

4 Thence to fall into woeful and irrecouerable despair, Genesis 4. and to
discover the same by madness, blasphemies, etc.

Secondly, In the life to come, by first:

1 Utter separation from the presence of God, and happiness for ever. 2. These.
1. 21.

2 Perpetual communion with Satan and the infernal spirits: and so of all
torments,

Especially

First, Desperate sorrow for an irrecouerable loss.

Secondly, Insufferable weight of the wrath of God.

Thirdly, Sensible torment, yet not to be expressed.

Fourthly, The worm of conscience accusing, and gnawing continually.

Fifthly, Bitter envy at the happiness of the elect.

Sixthly, Restles content, in this fearful condition.

Thus the Law discouers to man his miser^, and therefore,

First, It is to be preached to sinners. 2. Tim. 4. 2.

Secondly, Men are to be acquainted with the particulars of it.

Thirdly, And to yield to the power thereof, that so it may lead them to
Christ, who is properly revealed unto us in the preaching of the Gospel, which
does especially beget and perfect the work of Faith, and that

1 By making us to believe our misery, through a particular application thereof
unto our selves. Romans 7. 9. Romans 15. 4. Matthew. 9. 12.

2 By working anguish and sorrow inspirit for the same. Act. 2. 37. Ierem. 21.
1^. Judge. 2. 3, 10.

3 Aduising what to do, Luke 15. 17. Ierem. 8. ^, 7. and considering deeply
what we have done. Reu. 7. 24.

4 Submitting to Gods will, to be guided hereafter according to the same. Luke
17. 9. Eze. 36. 2. Act. 9. 6.

5 Hereupon the Lord further reueales himself unto the sinner in working a
secret desire of forgiveness, from the consideration of the kindness and readiness
of God to pardon, yea though it be but a drop of mercy. Luke 15. 17, 18.
Mat. 12. 20. Mat. 11* 28. Mat. 5. 4. Matthew. 9. 12. Luke 7. 38. Ion. 3. Hest. 4.
Pro. 28. 9. Job 33. 33.

6 This desire works a resolution to go to this gracious God, though yet he
feel not pardon for his sins. Luke 15.

7 Coming to God, sin is confessed in most conscionable, and in particular
manner. Psalm. 19. 12.

8 Pardon is most instantly and boldly begged for the same. Mat. 15. Romans 10.
14.

9 R^solution to renounce all, to buy this precious pearl: which is a kind of
assurance of the purchase of this pardon, Mat. 13. upon the due valuation of
the price of it, and so he promises a full forsaking of the wo^ld, Mat. 19.
29. Heb. 11 25* and utter renouncing of sin, Hose. 14. 9. etc. for ever. Luke
19. 9. 1. Samu. 7. 3, 4. Pro. 28. Phil. 1. 7, 8,

10 Hereupon follows an application of Christ and his promises by the seal
of the spirit. Romans 8. 16. 2. Cor. 1. 22. And hence proceed:

1 Contentation spiritual, and peace with God and our own consciences.

2 Following the true Shepherd. John 10.

3 Joy in the Spirit, and sweetness extraordinary. Romans 5. 2.

4 Admiration heavenly, at this wonderful work. 2. Cor. 1. 12.

5 Tenderness of conscience in all our actions. Heb. 13. 18.

6 Boldness to approach the throne of Grace. Romans 8. Heb. 10.

7 A mind estranged from the world and love thereof. Gal 5.

8 Holy conference, and asking the way to Sion.

9 Heavenly conversation. Phi. 3. 20.

10 Readiness and patience to and under the Cross Romans 5.

11 Desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ. Phili. 1. 23.

Thus is Faith wrought in us, thus may we discern the work thereof.

And this Faith is thus effectual, when it brings forth the fruit of an
holy life, whereby we are made partakers of the divine nature, and so made meet
to that happiness, whereinto no unclean thing shall enter. Ia^. 2. 2. Pet. 1.
3. Col. 1. 11. Reu. 21. 27.

Hence we may learn:

1 That there is no holiness in nature, and therefore no happiness from thence.
Romans 3. 9.

2 Our righteousness is of faith, laying hold on Jesus Christ. Phil. 3. 9.

3 Being redeemed by Christ, we must be zealous of good works, which God has
ordained us to walk in. Ephesians. 2. 10.

4 That we may not err in weldoing, nor be weary thereof, we must have a Guide
to direct us therein. John 11. 9.

CHAP. II.
This Guide is only the perfect word of God.
1 BEcause it is the brief of Gods revealed will. The word the guide of this
direction.
Ps 40. 7.

2 It reaches not only to the outward, but inward man also, and is a discerner
of the secret thoughts and raines. Heb. 4. 12.

3 It is that will of God, which the Lord would have to this end communicated
unto all. Colos. 1. 6. John 5. 35.

4 It is sufficient and absolutely perfect to accomplish whatsoever concerns
our entrance or perfection to eternal life. 2. Tim. 3. 16.

5 It is a sure and everlasting word, able to accomplish that which it
promises or threatens, and giving grace to perform that in some measure
which it enioyneth. Ephe. 6. 17. 1. Pet. 1. 2. Pet. 1. 19. Psalm. 19. 7. Psalm.
119. 93.

6 It is most plain and easy to be apprehended, as being a light shining in a
dark place. 2. Pe. 1. Pr. 8. 2. 2. Cor. 4. 4.

Hence it follows

1 That whatsoever is not warranted by the word, is sin. Apoc. 22. 18. Deuteronomy.
4. 2. Pro. 30. 6.

2 That the Law of nature written in our hearts, is no sufficient rule of life.
1. Cor. 2. 14. Matthew. 16. 17. Romans 2. 12.

3 Much less the Laws of nations are perfect rules to live by. Deu. 4. 6.

4 No will worship is accepted of God. Mat. 15. 9. Col. 2. 2 3. Deu. 12. 8.

5 Neither a good intention makes a good action, 2. Sam. 6. 6.

6 Nor an erroneous conscience excuses an evil fact, or makes that which is
doubtful good. Romans 14. 23

7 No not ignorant devotion auiales in Gods worship. Romans 10. 2. Acts 13. 5^,
51.

8 Much less the lawless lusts of our hearts, which tend to the destruction
of life. Ephesians. 1. 22.

9 Neither is the multitude a justifiable warrant of our actions. Ex. 23.

10 No not the examples of any, further then they square with the word. 1. Cor.
11. 1.

11 Neither the word it self in the letter, but in the spiritual meaning
thereof. Matt. 5.

12 And the meaning of the word to befetcht not from any other but the Word,
comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. 1. Cor. 2. 13.

13 Yea, the true meaning must be applied by faith before our actions can be
warranted thereby. Romans 14.

So does the word contain a perfect direction of our life.

CHAP. III.
THis direction is a daily and constant endeavor to serve God. What this
direction is, namely to serve God daily and constantly.
And that

1 Because the Lord requires such a daily and constant course. Philip. 3. 15.
Genesis 17. 1. Job. 1. 5.

2 The Lord gives grace and appoints means for the performance thereof, as the
continual inhabitation of his spirit, and the fruit thereof the holy seed
that remains in us. 1. Ioh 3 8.

3 The Saints of God have practiced such a course. Psa. 1.

4 To this end were we redeemed, that we should serve God in holiness and
righteousness all the days of our life. Luke 1.

5 God does daily bestow blessings upon us, therefore we must daily serve him.
Lam. 3. 23. Psalm. 103. 2.

6 Christ Jesus makes continual intercession for us: that we should daily,
yea hourly and continually perform acceptable service unto God.

7 Satan is never weary of tempting us: therefore we should have our loins
girt, and be always upon our watch to resist him. 1. Pet. 5 8.

8 We have not a days warrant, no not an hours certainty of life, therefore
we are at no time to be unprepared, because we know not the hour when our
master comes. Math 24.

9 We are pilgrims and travelers in this world, and therefore we must
travail each day homeward to our country Hebr. 11. 12.

10 By our calling we are watchmen, soldiers, etc. and therefore we must daily
be excercised in this spiritual war fare. 2. Timo thie 2. 6.

Hence it follows,

1 That to fancy any such service out of the word, which is not daily and
constant is sin. Hosea. 6. 4.

2 To think that the service of the Sabbath is all that God requires, is also
sin. Esai 1. 13.

3 It is in vain to serve God a^ random and not in an holy an^ constant order.

4 To put off the service of Go^ to the end of our life is most presumptuous.
Psalm. 95. 7.

5 To think I have any liberty o^ time to serve sin is Atheistica^ 1. Pet.
4. 2. Ephe. 5. 16.

6 That it is not will worship (...) perform this service, seeing it (...)
warranted by the word.

7 That it is no nouelty to seru^ God after this manner.

8 Neither is it precisenes to (...) our selves hereunto, seeing it is revealed
and therefore belongs vnt^ us. Deuter. 29. 29. Ephe. 5^ 15.

Therefore that we may serve God according to his word we must performed (...)
and continual obedience to him. Colos. 1. 10.

CHAP. IIII. What this daily course is, namely a constant purpose to serve God.

ANd this is, first a purpose of the heart, to serve God, as God: who^ly and
continually. Heb. 13. 18.

2 This purpose is settled and ro^ted in the heart, and brings forth some
constant fruit of obedience every day. Col 1. 23. Col. 7. 23.

3 It is also sincere, and general, having respect unto all Gods
commandments, in all things desirous to please him daily, and to be fruitful
in every good work. Psalm. 119. 6. Colos. 1. 10.

Fourthly, it respects the ends, which are two:

1 Gods glory, not any worldly or vain respects. 1. Cor. 10. 31.

2 The eternal salvation of my soul, not any transitory or outward blessing.
Phil. 3. 8. 1. Pet. 1. 9.

5 It enioynes these so far as God shall inwardly enable, and outward means
permit, rather to put us in mind what we should be, then what we can be in this
life. 1. Cor. 8. 12.

Hence it follows,

First, Sect. 1. This course to be known though impossible to be keept.
that though this course were impossible, yet were it necessary to be known,
and indeauored of us.

1 That it might be a daily rule of our life.

2 That it might continually humble us under the mighty hand of God.

3 That it might daily drive us to Christ.

4 That it might weane us from the world, and fit us to eternal happiness.

Hence it follows

Secondly, Sect. 2. It is not impossible
That it is not impossib^^ in some good measure, to keep suc^ a course and
trade of holiness:

1 Because it presumes not absolute perfection; which indeed we^^ folly for
any to dream of in th^^ life, but is only a following hard (...) the mark,
and furtherance to perfection. Phil. 3. 13.

2 It is no harder a task, the (...) what the Saints of God do desi^^ to
attain, Psalm. 90. 12. have voluntarily undertaken, and in most comfortable
measure performed. Genesis 5. 22.

3 It may stand well with our ordinary callings. 1. Tim. 4. 8.

4 Neither does it exclude our lawful comforts. 2. Tim. 4. 8.

Hence it follows:

Thirdly, Sect. 3. It is necessary.
That it is no more the needs must to take this course:

1 Because hereby we show our selves obedient to Gods commandment. Genesis 17. 1.

Secondly, We do also approve the soundnes of our obedience: as

1 That it is hearty, not hypocritical.

2 Not by halfes, but general.

3 Not temporary, but continual.

4 Not indifferent, but conscionable.

5 Not enforced, but free and cheerful. Deuteronomy. 28 47.

6 Not uncertain, but constant.

7 Not carnal, but spiritual.

Thirdly, Hereby we increase in righteousness and holiness: as being

First, Confirmed in well doing, and that

1 By the knowledge of our healy thrift. 1. These. 4. 10. Mat. 25. 16.

2 Thankfulness unto God for it.

3 Commending the success to God.

4 Craving his further supply.

Secondly, Recovered also we shall be out of evil:

1 By seeing our escapes. Jeremy 3. 13.

2 Judging them. 1 Cor. 11. 32.

3 Denying our selves. Mat. 16.

4 Casting our selves upon Christ Matthew. 11.

Fourthly, Hereby also our outward callings are furthered, as

1 Being sanctified by this spiritual exercise. 1. Tim. 4. 5.

2 Moderated, lest we be drunken with them. Deuteronomy. 17. 18.

3 Ordered to the right end, lest they misleade us. 1. Cor. 10. 31.

4 Seasoned, lest we be weary of them.

5 Blessed, in seeing a happy return by them. Psalm. 128.

Hence it follows:

Fourthly, that this duty is most convenient for all sorts.

Both for all persons, as well 1. babes in Christ, as 2. strong men.

And for all estates, as well in prosperity as in adversity.

First, For babes in Christ: that

1 They may begin well.

2 They may go forward without grief, uncertainty, wearisomnes.

3 That they may obtain a more glorious crown.

Secondly, For strong men and that

1 To keep them constant from backsliding. Colos. 2. 7.

2 To make them more able to win and hold others. Romans 14. 1.

3 To acquaint them with the deepenes of Satan. Apoc. 2. 24.

4 To prepare them to greater glory. Dan. 12. 3.

5 To humble them in the sense of their extraordinary graces. 2. Cor. 12.

Thirdly, it is fit for men in prosperity: and that

1 To prevent security. Esai. 5. 12.

2 To humble them in regard of those temporal things. Luc. 12. 48.

3 To teach them how to use them to Gods glory, their own and their
neighbors good. 1. Tim. 6. 17.

4 That they may part with them willingly. Pil. 4. 12.

5 That all may be counted as dung in respect of heaven. Philip. 3. 8.

Fourthly, this practice also will be very necessary in the time of affliction:
And that

1 To prepare us thereunto. Pro, 28. 14. Job 3. 25.

2 To qualify the sharpenes of it.

3 To be conquerors in our troubles and over them. Romans 8.

4 To be delivered finally from them. Psalm. 34.

And therefore though do what we can, Sect. 4. And profitab^e.
some corruptions shall still remain, yet this labor is not unprofitable:

1 Because God accepts herein the purpose of our hearts. 2. Corrinth. 8 12.

2 The Lord will have some infirmities still left in us to humble (...)
withal. ^. Cor. 12.

3 Our hatred of sin shall be perfited hereby, though it remain^ in us.

4 The strength of sin shall also much be abated in us.

5 Our edge to eternal happiness shall be still sharpened, and ou^ desire
enflamed to fit us thereto. Romans 7.

Neither is this labor uncomfortable, Sect 5. And pleasant.
For,

1 We increase hereby an assurance of our salvation. The benefit of constant
godliness, and therein the Privilege of Christians.
2. Peter 1. 9. 10.

2 We grow more settled, and resolved in godliness, and get the masterie of
inconstancy. Ephesians. 3. 18. 19.

3 We perform holy duties more easily. Ps. 119. 32. Ioh. 4. 34. Mat. 11. 24.

4 We have more near and sweet fellowship with our blessed God, and his holy
spirit 1. Tim 4 10. Mat. 10. 30. Ps. 1. 3. Romans 8. 31. Ps. 2. 12.

5 We prevent many noisome lusts which otherwise would fasten on us. Psalm
119. 10. 11. John 15. 15. Exodus 19. 5. Pro. 19. 23.

6 We are freed from many temporal judgments which unstaid souls are
subject to. Psalm 91. 11. Psalm. 32. 10. 11.

7 Our score shall be the less, and our reckoning more easy at the day of
judgment.

8 Hereby we shall have our conversation in heaven. Philip. 3. 21.

9 Our heart and the inordinate lusts thereof shall be keept at a bay.

10 We shall be armed against all temptations, and secured in the midst of
them. Ephesians. 6. 13.

11 We shall be weaned from the love of this wretched world.

12 Yea led forward constantly to obtain the end of our faith, which is the
salvation of our souls. Ephesians. 6. 2. Tim. 4.

13 We shall approve our selves not to be of the world by our contrary fashion
to it. Romans 12.

14 We shall recover our first Image, in being holy as God is holy. 1. Pet. 1.

15 And ready to meet our Savior whenever he shall come. Ephesians. 6. Math.
24 25. etc.

16 We shall see our daily weakness and inability to serve God, and so
acknowledge unfeignedly our unworthiness of the least mercies, and so happily
prevent spiritual pride.

17 We gain hereby a certain knowledge of our estate in grace, and by the
light hereof we know whither we walk. 1. John 3. 1.

18 We shall be raised up from our falls into sin. 1. Ioh. 2. 2.

19 We shall use prosperity aright. Job 3. 1. 24. Ier. 8. 4. 6.

20 And overcome all troubles. Romans 8. 36.

21 Yea we shall be fitter to win others. Gal. 6. 1.

22 And so grow forward to perfection. Col. 1. 9. Ioh. 7. 52.

23 And happily be continued to the end.

CHAP. V.
IT being now apparent that there is a daily sacrifice of obedience to be
performed unto God: What are the particulars of this daily sacrifice.
And that it is neither impossible nor unprofitable, but very necessary, fit
and behoosefull unto us; let us consider further these two points:

1 What duties we are necessarily bound in conscience to perform daily.

2 How we are to entertain the several occasions of the day as usually they
fall out, in this holy and constant manner.

CHAP. VI.
That which we are necessarily bound to do daily, is
FIrst to be humbled before the Lord in the sense of our own 1 To be humbled
before the Lord in the sense of our sins.
or others sins by true and unfeigned repentance.

And that because,

1 The best service we shall do must be sanctified by repentance.

2 Hereby we give glory unto God, and offer a daily sacrifice acceptable unto
him. Psalm. 51. 18.

3 Hereby we deny our selves and daily take up our cross. Math. 16.

4 We approve our right and estate in Christ Jesus in that we confess our
selves to be sinners and such as have daily need of his mercy, and so daily
fit our selves unto the same. Math. 11 28.

5 We justify the truth of our religion against all the imaginary per^ection
of Popery, and security, of Libertines and Atheists whomsoever, and so do
daily give an account of our faith. 1. Pet. 3. 15.

Now this duty is conscionably performed, Sect. 1. Practice of repentance.


First, By taking a strict view and account of them by the glass of the law.
Psalm. 19. 11.

Secondly, by mourning before the Lord in the sense of them, not so much for
fear of the punishment, as that we have offended so good a God. Luke 15. 21.

Thirdly, by acknowledging our sins unto the Lord. Prou 28. 13. and that,

1 From the fountain, original sin. Psalm. 51. 5.

2 From the streams; both our thoughts so far^e as we may, our idle words, and
profane actions. Psalm. 19. 12. 13. And here both,

1 What good we have omitted.

2 What ^uil we have committed.

3 How we have sinned of ignorance. Psalm. 73 22.

4 How of knowledge we have transgres^ed, etc. Especially and more particularly
we must acknowledge,

1 The sins we have bin subject to. Psalm 51. 14.

2 Those which for the present we groan under.

3 Those which we fear most. Psalm. 19. 13.

4 The sins of our fathers. Nehem. 9.

5 The sins of the Land and State among whom we live. Daniel 9.

6 Yea, such as in particular we know not, we are notwithstanding to yield up
to be searched by the Lord; and by his mercy either to be brought to our
remembrance, or to be graciously passed over. Psalm. 19. 12.

Fourthly, Sin being thus acknowledged, we must further proceed to a
detestation thereof, Job 42. and of our selves for the same.

Fifthly, Then we must feel them a burden which we are not able to bear.
Act. 2. 37. Psalm., 8. 4.

Lastly, We must fly unto Jesus Christ, by faith to be eased of this burden.
Matthew. 11 28.

Helps hereunto, are

1 The due contemplation of the Majesty of God, Sect. 2. Helps to this practice.
whom we have so highly offended. Psalm 51. 4.

2 The vileness and abiectnes of man, that durst commit such wickedness against
God.

3 The danger that he has incurred hereby, even all the plagues that are
written in Gods book, Deuteronomy 29. 27.

4 The riches of Gods mercy, in providing so excellent a remedy against
sin, as the precious blood of his only and dearly beloved Son, when
nothing in the world was available thereunto. 1. Peter 1.

5 The excellency of our estate in Jesus Christ, with the manifold privileges
and benefits thereof. 1. John 3 1.

6 Our unthankfulness against the blood of the Covenant, in not walking worthy
of the same. Ephesians. 4. 1.

7 The danger hereof, to have made the same, so much as lies in us, of none
effect. Heb. 10.

8 That we have grieved Gods holy Spirit Ephe. 4 30.

9 And dulled, if not quenched the graces of God in us. 1. Thessalo. Sect. 3.
Marks of repentance.
5. 19.

Marks of true repentance, are

1 Refusing carnal comforts more then ordinarily. Jonah 3. 6. Esai. 64. 6.

3 Desire to be more vile. 1. Tim. 1. 13. 15.

3 Mourning and complaining of hardness of heart. Esai. 63. 17.

4 Sorrow for the sins of others. Dan. 9. Ezec. 9. Psalm. 119. 136.

5 Trembling at the word, and yet loving the sharpest blows thereof. Psalm.
119. 120.

6 Submiting our selves to Gods chastisements. Psalm. 39. 9. Mich. 7. 9.

7 Laboring the conversion of others. Psalm. 51. 17.

8 Shame of humane society. Ezech. 16. 61.

9 Fear of the wrath of God. Psalm. 119. 120.

10 Strong cries for mercy. Joel. 2. 17.

11 Fear of the occasions and hatred of all appearance of evil. 1. Thessa. 5.
22. 1. Tim. 5. 14. Jude. 23.

12 Poverty of spirit in regard of sin all our life long. Math. 5. 3. 2.
Ephesians. 3. 12. Sect. 4. Effects of repentance.


The effects and benefits hereof, are

1 We shall cut off custom in sin, and prevent security in the same. Math.
26. 41.

2 Our fear of God shall be increased, and so the rage of sin abated Psalm.
119. 133.

3 Self love shall be weakened and happily subdued.

4 The sandy foundation of natuere shall be discovered, and wisely abandoned.
^om. 3. 9. 20.

5 An holy despair of our selves procur^d.

6 Our hunger after Christ Jesus more sharpened and increased.

7 The heart exceedingly eased of a most grievous burden. Psalm 32. 4. 5.

8 Yea the very body much quieted and maintained in health. Psalm. 32. 5.

CHAP. VII.
THE soul being thus humbled, Of the raising up of a sinner by a true and
lively faith
must be raised up again by a true and lively faith: and this is the second
duty daily to be performed: and that

1 Because our former humiliation without this raising up, will either drive us
to despair, or else make our life most uncomfortable unto us. Gal. 2. 20.
Phil. 3.

2 Because nothing will prosper in the day without this comfort, neither our
desires for what we want, nor our use of that we have.

3 By this we truly live the life of grace, and so have our conversation here
in heaven.

4 Hereby also we die daily, and so are fitted unto glory. Col. 1. 11.

5 That so whatsoever be^ide us, this may be sufficient for us. 2. Cor. 12.

Now we are raised up by faith to the certain assurance of the forgiveness of
our sins, Sect. 1 How faith is revived in us.
after this manner:

First, by reviving and increasing of our knowledge, that Jesus Christ is the
alone propitiatio^ for our sins.

This is performed,

1 By a serious meditation on the promise of the Messiah. John 3. 16.

2 By exercising our selves more conscionably in the reading, and hearing of
the word taught. John 5. 39.

Secondly, Faith is quickened by reviving our apprehension of the promise; and
this is done,

1 By earnest prayer unto God for the renewing of his Spirit in us. Psalm. 51. 12.

2 By an hearty acknowledgement, that we have justly grieved the Spirit of
God, and so are deservedly deprived of the feeling thereof. Psalm 51* 4.
Lamentation 3. 22, 37.

3 Meditating of our former comfort and assurance herein. Psalm 77.

And this reviving has many degrees.

First, Sect. 2. The degrees of this work.
A lively sense what need I have of Christ, and that without him I must
certainly perish. Romans 7. 24, 25.

Secondly, Hope of pardon, whereby though we yet feel not our sins
certainly pardoned, yet we believe that they are pardonable; not in respect
of themselves, as if they were less heinous, but in respect of God, whose
mercies are above them. Esaias 1. 18.

Thirdly, An hungring and thirsting after grace offered in Jesus Christ. Ioh.
6. 35, 7, 37. Reu 21. 6.

And this is discerned,

1 By our prizing and preferring it above all other comforts. Philip. 3.

2 By our fainting and languishing after it Psalm. 42.

3 By our strong cries and endeavors for the same. Psalm 51. 12, 13. etc.

Fourthly, We approach to the th^one of grace, and flying from the terror of
the law, we take hold on Christ, and find favor in God. Heb. 4. 16. Heb. 10. 19.

And this is performed:

1 By an humble confession of thy sin in particular, whereupon follows a
full remission of them. Psalm 32. 5.

2 Craving pardon of some special sins, with unspeakable sighs and
perseverance. Lu. 15. 21. Act. 8. 21.

Fifthly, Hereupon follows a particular persuasion imprinted in the heart by
the holy Ghost, whereby every faithful man does particularly apply unto
himself those promises which are made in the Gospel. Mat. 9. 2. Mat. 15. 28.
Psalm. 143. 12.

This persuasion is discerned by these marks: Sect. 3. The marks of
particular assurance.


1 It goes before experience, Mat. 15. 23. and so our faith is supernatural and
contrary to all reason. Heb. 11. 1.

2 It holds beyond experience. Job 13. 15. Heb. 11. 1. and is above all feeling.

3 And never leaves us till we have obtained the end thereof, which is the
salvation of our souls. ^ Pet. 1. 9.

This persuasion has these degrees: Sect. 4. The degrees thereof.


First it takes hold weakly, Weakness of Faith.
not without doubting, and yet soundly and truly, so that it is accepted of
God. Luke 17. 5. Mat. 8.

And it is discerned,

1 By an earnest desire and endeavor to obtain Gods favor. How known.
Math. 5. 6.

2 By a continual complaining of our unbelief, and mourning for it. Marc. 9.
24.

3 By an earnest striving against it, in using all good helps, as prayer, the
word, conference, etc. Math. 8. 25. Luke 17. 5.

This weakness proceeds,

1 From want of knowledge in the mystery of salvation. How caused.
Romans 14. 2. Math. 16. 16. Ioh. 6 6^.

2 For want of application to our selves of the particular promise. 2. Tim. 1.
12.

3 For want of observation and entertainment of such comforts as have been
offered unto us. Math. 16. 8. 9. 2. Tim. 4. 17.

And it is caused by,

1 Withdrawing the light of Gods countenance. Psalm 30. 6.

2 Some gross sin committed. Psalm. 51.

3 Means neglected, as the word, prayer, etc. John. 20. 24.

4 Some spiritual pride in the heart. 2* Cor. 12.

5 Want of constancy and setlednes in religion. Galat. 1. 6. 2. These. 2. 2.

Secondly, Sect. 5. Strength of faith.
Faith takes hold strongly and fully persuades the heart, that God loves me,
that Christ is mine, and all things with him. Romans 4. 22. Romans 8. 38.

And it is discerned.

1 By cheerefulnes in troubles: How known.
and so in all occasions. Romans 5. 3.

2 Boldness in the cause of God. Act. 5.

3 Wisdom in our Christian callings. Ephesians 3.

4 Crucifying our selves to the world, and the world to us. Gallath. 5.

5 Preparation to suffer. Act. 21.

6 Desire and longing after death. 1. Phil. 22.

And it is obtained,

1 By constancy in our callings. How obtained.


2 Combatting with many troubles, especially those of our own unbelieving
hearts. Luc. 22. 32.

3 Comforting others and raising up afflicted consciences. 1. Phil. 2 Cor. 1. 4.

4 By long experience of Gods favor and love in many deliverances. Psalm. 23. 5.

5 By ripenes and dexterity in the means: as power in prayer, the word, etc.
Ephesians. 6. 18.

6 Daily examining and trying our selves. Psalm. 4. 34.

7 Renouncing the especial sin which hangs so fast upon us He. 12. 1.

8 Renewing daily our covenant with God, and charging it afresh upon our hearts
to constancy.

CHAP. VIII.
AND this is the third duty daily we must perform, The preparing and
furnishing the heart to the service of God.
namely; to renew our vows, and stir^e up our hearts to the service of God.

1 Because the heart is that which God principally delights in. Prou. 23. 26.

2 The heart is the fountain of every action, if it be cleansed, the actions
will be suitable. Luke 8.

3 The infirmity of the action shall not be imputed, if the heart be ordered
aright. 2. Corinthians 8. 12.

4 As the body sleeps, so the heart sleeps too, and therefore the one must
be awaked as the other. Esaias 29. 10.

Now the heart may be cast into a sleep. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 6. Sect. 1. The heart
asleep, and by what means.


1 By ignorance of it self. Ephesians. 5. 14.

2 By selfeloue, and ouerweening of it own perfections.

3 By neglecting the means.

4 By corrupt means in stead of the pure fountains.

5 By the ceasing of Gods Spirit to work.

6 By some gross sin committed. 2. Sam. 11.

7 By security in prosperity and sin.

8 By presumption of Gods mercies or it own merits. Matthew 26. 33.

9 By stupiditie and senselessness.

10 By spiritual blindness and hardness of heart.

The preparing of the heart has these degrees:

First, It must be awakened and roused up, Sect. 2. The heart to be awakened,
and how.
and that

1 By meditating.

1 What it was by nature. Ierem. 17. 9. Matthew. 15. 19.

2 What it is now by grace. To. 6. 2. Ephesians 4. 23.

3 How unsearchable and endless agulfe it is. 1* Cor. 4 4.

2 By yielding it up to God, and exposing it naked before him, and that

1 Both confessing its corruption, and deceitfulnes.

2 And also submitting it wholly to his government.

3 Reforming the occasions whereby it was laid asleep, as

1 Ignorance, by the glass of the word. Iam. 1. 25.

2 Self-love, by viewing our selves in the glass of the conscience examined
by the Law. Romans 7. 8, 9.

3 using the means conscionably.

4 Especially not closing with corrupt means.

5 Renew the Spirit by unfeigned repentance. Psalm. 51. 10.

6 Forsake not only gross sins, but even all, yea all appearance of sin. 1.
These. 5. 22.

7 Be we always watchful over our selves. Luke 22.

8 Avoid we presumption by meditation of Gods justice. Jude 5. 6, 7.

9 Remedy we stupidity by quicknes in apprehension, and forwardnes to judge
our selves. 1. Cor. 11. 31.

10 Break we our hard hearts with the hammer of Gods word. Iere. 23. 29. 1.
Cor. 9. 27.

The heart being awakened, must be thoroughly sifted and examined, Sect. 3. The
heart awakned, must be examined: And how.
and that

First, 1. By a true rule.
By a true rule.

1 Not by it self, but by the law of God. Heb. 4. 12.

2 Neither by the world, but by the conscience informed by the word. Ierem 6.
14.

3 Not by opinion, but by the evidence of the Spirit. Roman. 8. 16. Romans 14. 5.
Pro. 14. 12.

4 Neither by the laws of men, but by the rule of faith. Matthew. 15. 9. Acts 4.
19.

5 Neither by the letter of Gods Law, but by the spiritual meaning thereof.
Mat. 5.

6 Not by the outward condition, but by the inward experience. Eccles 9. 1.
Pro. 14. 13.

7 Neither by outward actions, but by inward purposes. Ierem. 17. 10. Io^ 2. 13.

8 Not by the examples of the most, but of the best. Luke 18. 1. Cor. 11* 1.

Secondly, 2 By an holy manner.
We must examine the heart after a true and holy manner.

Not once or seldom, but daily. Psalm 119.

Not slightly but seriously, even from the bottom. Psalm. 119. 12.

Not on the one side, but on both, as well what evil we have done as what good.

Neither in general, but in particular, concerning the chief good or evil.
Psalm. 51.

And that not partially but conscionably and indifferently, both concerning it
weakness and also it strength. Psalm. 42.

Thirdly, we must herein aim at a right end: 3 To a right end*


1 Not vain glory, but the praise of God.

2 Neither for self-love, but to deny our selves.

3 Not for love of the world, but to the renouncing thereof.

4 Neither for fear of death, but to be prepared to it.

5 Not to remit of our sincerity, but to increase in holiness. Psalm. 119.

6 Not to prefer our selves before others, that are behind us, but to be
humbled in regard of those that have out-stript us.

7 Not to be approved of the world, but to the conuincing or converting
thereof.

8 Not to make us distrust God, but to increase our co^fide^ce in him.

9 And so to hunger more constantly after him.

The heart being thus tried and examined, Sect. 4. The heart examined, must be
established in the worship of God.
must be established and confirmed in the service of God. Psalm. 51. 12. Pro. 4.

And that by these means:

First, And how.
by resigning it up to the guidance of the almighty. Psalm. 119.

Secondly, by renewing our vows and binding us to the performance of them. and
that

1 By public protestation.

2 By solemn and conscionable oaths. 2. Chron. 15.

3 By the curse of the law. Nehem. 10. 31.

4 Calling others to witness, as the Church of God.

Thirdly, we must continually fear our selves, and have a holy jealousy of
our best actions. Proverb. 28. 14.

And that in regard,

1 Of the vnsearchablenes of our hearts. Ier. 17. 9.

2 Of the privy corruptions that do assault us. Psalm. 19.

3 In respect of the infirmities that do accompany our best actions. Job 4. 18.

4 As also especially in regard of the presence of our gracious God beholding
and approving all our actions. Psalm 33. 13.

And this fear is discerned,

1 By an earnest striving against our coruptions.

2 By a desire to approve our selves to the Church of God.

3 By tenderness of conscience in all our actions.

4 By lowlines in our carriage, even toward our inferiors.

Fourthly, There must be a constant watching over the outward man, avoiding
both the occasions of evil, and the least appearance thereof. Psalm. 39. 1. Job
31. 1.

Fifthly, We must moderate our selves in our Christian liberty, Gal. 5. 13* and
that by these rules:

1 Of our callings, that we exceed not them. 1. Corin 7. 20.

2 Of the times, that we bring forth fruit in due season. Psalm 1. 3.

3 Of the place, that in outward things we conform thereto. 1. Cor. 9. 20.

4 Of the persons, that we give no just offense. 1. Cor. 10. 33.

Here our guides must be:

Love, which seeks not our own. 1. Cor. 13.

Wisdom, to become all unto all. 1. Cor. 9.

And our ends,

1 Expediencie, that we may be fitting. 1. Cor. 10.

2 Under that which may be seemly. Col. 2.

3 Edification, that which may benefit our selves and others. 1. Cor. 10.

4 And principally the glory of Almighty God. 1. Cor. 10. 31.

Sixthly, We must entertain and cherish the motions of the Spirit of God. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 19. 2. Tim. 1. 6.

This is performed:

1 By a wise discerning of them. 1. Tim. 4. 14.

2 By an high esteem of them.

3 By rejoicing in them, as if we had found the greatest treasures. Mat. 13. 44.

4 By putting them speedily in execution. Psalm. 45. 1.

5 By offering up an extraordinary sacrifice of praise for them, abasing our
selves in regard of such excellent graces, and acknowledging the free mercy of
God in so gracious a fellowship. Psalm 116. 7, 12.

Seventhly, If the Spirit of God shall lie asleep in us Psalm 119.

This we shall discern:

1 By great terrors in the conscience.

2 A kind of loathing of holy duties.

3 Great coldness and deadnes in the use of them.

4 Little sensible comfort when we have performed them. Psalm. 77. 2, 3.

5 Much coffeehouse in the mind, and blindness in the same. Psa. 6. 3.

6 Aptnes to rush into the sins we have heretofore conquered.

7 Unwillingness to die, etc.

Here then we must at no hand bless our souls in this estate, but

First, rouse up the Spirit, and labor to be quickened, and that by using the
holy means: as

1 The Ministry of the word. Powerful.
Psalm. 6. 6.

2 Private and strong crying unto God. Psalm. 51.

3 Craving the effectual prayers of the saints. James 5. 15.

4 Using more conscionably their fellowships, and opening our state unto them.

5 Racking our hearts by a serious and impartial examination, and committing
our most special tentations to record.

6 Promising more faithfulness for the time to come. Psalm. 80. 18.

7 And binding our selves more constantly to the conversion of others. Psalm.
116. 18. Psalm. 32. 8. 9. Ps. 34. 3. 8. 11.

8 Exercising a daily course of repentance.

9 Not neglecting also to humble our selves in this behalf in some private
fast unto God. Psalm. 35. in our closets or families.

Eighthly, make we some experiment upon some chief lust of the heart to get the
mastery over it for by an experimental conquest over one, we shall learn in
time to conquer all the rest.

And this must be done:

1 By observing the deepenes of Satan in his variety of baits, to draw us into
the snare.

2 Considering the deceitfulnes of the heart, how gladly it would close with
Satan.

3 Remembering our former tripping by the like tentation.

4 Thereupon confess we in humble prayer unto God that we have deserved to
be overtaken with it.

5 Detest we our selves that sin has got such ground of us. Job 42.

6 Hereupon vow we revenge against our treacherous flesh. 2. Cor. 7. 11.

7 And practice we the same by the former rules of humiliation, and such as
hereafter shall be laid down.

8 And so being wise to fear our selves in regard of the said tentation we
shall happily get the conquest of it. Prou 14.

9 We must daily recount how we have profited in godliness. Psalm. 119.

10 we must prepare our selves continually to afflictions. Luke 9. s 23.

11 We must be plentiful in good works. 2. Pet. 1. 9.

12 In all our actions, specially extraordinary we must not trust to that
soundnes of heart which has been, but try them by that which is, that so
from the sense of the pureness of the fountain the streams may flow more
certainly and purely. Luke 6. 43. Mat. 13.

13 Though the heart may appear to be sound, yet the goodness of the action
must not so much depend upon the soundnes of the heart appearing, as upon the
free mercies of God accepting the same.

14 We must provide a complet armor for the heart, being prepared to preserve
it. Ephesians. 6. 13.

CHAP. IX.
And this is the fourth duty of necesssity to be performed daily by us: Of the
spiritual armor, and arming of the heart.
Namely to arm our hearts against all tentations. And that,

1 Because such an armor is commended unto us in the word. Ephesians. 6.

2 Our enemies are mighty princes and armed wickednesses. Ephesians. 6. 16.

3 The heart without it lies open to all tentations.

4 By it we shall be able to cast down all strong holds. 2. Cor. 10. 4 which
stand in our way to happiness. 1. Tim. 6. 11.

5 And so shall lay hold on eternal life, and finish our course with joy. 2.
Tim. 4. 6.

Here consider these three points:

1 What this armor is.

2 How it is to be put on.

3 How to be kept on.

This armo^ has many pieces. Sect. 1. The parts of the spiritual armor and,
1. of the girdle of truth It parts are:


First, the Girdle of truth and sincerity. Ephesians. 6. 14. and this consists of
these parts:

The first is a rectified judgment proceeding from an illightned and sanctified
understanding, wrought by a live faith through the word of God. Ephesians. 4. 13.

And it has these properties: Sect. 2. 1 A rectified judgment.


1 It is sound in what it knows. Coloss. 1. 6. 9.

2 It retains safely what it knows. Psalm. 119. 11.

3 It is wise to distinguish between things that differ, Philip. 1. and so to
try the Spirits. 1. John 4. 1.

4 It discernes all things. 1. Cor. 2. 15.

5 It comprehends the height, and breadth, and depth, and length. Ephesians. 3.

6 It knows no man after the flesh. 2. Cor. 5. 16.

7 It knows but in part, and so is subject to error. 1. Cor. 13.

8 It is not obstinate in error, but willing to be reformed in what it has
been misinformed. 2. Tim. 2. 16.

9 It is apt and desirous to receive further illumination. Colos. 1. 10 2. Tim.
3. 7.

10 And daily increases in this saving knowledge. How put on.
Heb. 5. 12.

Helps to put on this armor, are

1 A discerning of our own inward blindness. Psalm. 119. 28.

2 A daily meditation in the word and works of God. Psalm. 1.

3 A faithful recording, and comparing of things past with things present; and
so collecting for the time to come. Luke 2. 51.

And this part of the Girdle serves:

1 To condemn the blindness of nature. The benefit thereof.
1. Corint. 2. 14. Matthew 16. 17.

2 To discern between the light of nature and grace, the illightning and
sanctifying Spirit. Col. 1. 9 Ephesians. 5. 8.

3 To direct all our actions: for as we know, so we do. Romans 14. 5, 23.

4 To make trial of them: for if they have not the light, it is because there
is no truth in them. Ioh. 3. 21.

5 To inform and instruct others. Psalm. 34.

The second part of this Girdle is, Sect. 3. The sanctified conscience, and how
discerned*
a sanctified conscience: and it is discerned

1 By this; that it excuses for all sins, as our persons are accepted in
Christ. 1. Cor. 4. 4.

2 It checkes for the least sin, before actual repentance be performed. 1.
John 5. 17.

3 It approues our upright walking in the whole course of our life. Acts 23. 1.
Psalm. 26. 1.

4 It procures us peace with God. Romans 5. 1. and with men so far as it is
possible and expedient. To. 12. 18.

5 It breeds contentment in the life and al occasions. Phil. 4. 12.

6 It procures cheerfulnes in the countenance, and readiness in all our business.
Pro. 28. 1.

7 It makes us courageous in the truth, and willing by all means to defend the
same. Acts 4. 13. Acts 6. 15. Acts 18. 26.

8 It maks us victorious in troubles, and

9 Ready to yield up our lives into the hands of God. How put on.
Act. 21. 23.

And it is put on and preserved,

1 By making conscience of all things commanded. Psalm. 119. 6.

2 By keeping it tender and sensible of the least evil. Heb. 13. 18.

3 To this end view we it daily in the glass of the word, that so the judgment
may be kept clear to prevent security.

4 Examine we, and censure the daily errors thereof by calling it before the
Lord, to avoid spiritual blindness.

5 Avoid we above all things, doubtfulnes, and distraction in our actions.
Romans 14. 5.

6 Especially keep we our selves from wilful fighting against the light
thereof, in committing gross and presumptuous sins. Psalm. 19. 12.

7 Have we always more regard of it in the sight of God, then of our credit
with me^. 1. Cor. 4. 4. To. 2. 29

8 File we into the bosom thereof when outward things cross us. Acts 23. 1.

9 Rest we not so upon the justification thereof, but that we refer it to the
mercy of God. 1. Cor. 4. 4.

The benefit of this part of the Girdle is:

1 It procures and maintains true inward joy. The benefit thereof.
2. Cor. 1. 12.

2 Hereby we have always boldness before God. 1. Ioh. 3. 20. to obtain good
things at his hands. He 10.

3 And are enabled and furnished against all the reproaches and evils of men.
Pro. 18.

4 By this we are always certain of the things we do, and the acceptance of
them in the sight of God. Psalm. 51. 6.

Hereby we are comforted in the greatest buffetings of Satan, and our cowardly
and unbelieving hearts. 1. John 3. 21.

6 And led along in most cheerful manner throughout all difficulties to the
receiving of the reward. Heb. 11. 26.

7 We increase in sanctification and holiness. 1. Timothy 1. 18. 19.

8 We put to confusion the pride and practices of our enemies. 1. Sam. 26. 21.

9 We receive hereby a pledge of eternal life, and have our conversation in
heaven. Romans 8. 16. Phi. 3. 20.

A third part of this sincerity consists in the will, Sect. 4. The sincerity of
the will. It marks.
which discouers it self:

1 By cheerefulnes in weldoing, not by compulsion, but of a willing mind. 1.
Cor. 9. 1. Pet. 5.

2 Resisting sin and the occasions thereof. Psalm. 119. 104.

3 Yielding to sin with grief. Romans 7. 15.

4 Rising by repentance out of the same. Pro. 28. 14.

The state and measure hereof is: It measure


1 That it is not free to good or evil, but freed to do good. Philip. 2. 13.

2 Yet so freed as that it is in bondage to sin. Romans 7. 18.

3 Yet so in bondage, as that it strives against that slavery, and gets daily
ground thereof. Romans 7. 25. Ephesians. 2. 3.

The benefit hereof is:

1 To enable us to do good. The benefit thereof.
Romans 7. 18.

2 To comfort us in our outward faylings. 2. Corinthians. 8. 12. Rom 7. 19.

3 To discern of our state in sanctification. Ephesians. 2 3. 1. Corin. 12. 2.

4 To keep our judgments sincere and upright. 1. Tim 6 5.

5 To kindle and order our affections in the service of God.

And this is a fourth part of this Girdle, Sect. 5. The well ordering of the
affections, and how discerned.
even the well ordering of our affections. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23. Romans 7. 24.

And this is discerned:

1 By a right moving of them to their proper objects. Romans 7. 22, 25.

2 By their contentment in the same.

3 In that we can more joy or grieve for spiritual causes then for carnal.
Psalm. 4. Psalm. 119.

4 That they tend to the crucifiing of the flesh, and building forward of the
new man. Colossi. 3. 1.

5 That indeed by them we are wholly emptied in our selves in respect of God.
2. Cor. 5. 16. Ge. 5. 22. Romans 12. 1.

Helps hereunto are:

1 Knowledge of the right object. Mark. 3. 5. 2. Cor. 7.

2 Weaning and abating them from the false. 1. John. 2. 15.

3 Trial of our selves in the practice of some one of our affections. Deuteronomy. 6.
5.

4 Conscience to use them all in their several times and measure. Eccles. 3.
1. Romans 12. 16.

The benefit hereof, is,

1 We shall attain hereby a gracious conquest over our most unruly thoughts.
The benefit thereof.
Ephesians. 4 25.

2 We shall find much sweet peace and contentment in our Christian callings.

3 We shall be more ready pressed to good actions. 2. Cor. 7.

4 And saved from many noysom tentations, which otherwise would assault us. 2.
Ephesians. 4. 26. John. 19. 12.

5 We shall have gracious fellowship with God. Col 3. 1.

6 And be better enabled to the conversion of our brethren. John 21. 15.

A fifth part of this Girdle is the sincerity of the tongue:

As being the stern of the ship and the certain Image of the mind. Sect. 6.
The sincerity of the tongue. Wherein it is seen.
Iam. 3. 5.

And it is discerned:

1 In holy speech. Eccles. 3. 7.

2 In wise and seasonable silence.

Concerning fit and warrantable Speech, we are to observe:

1 Preparation to speech.

2 The matter of it.

3 The manner thereof.

4 The end of the same.

We shall be prepared to Speech, Sect. 7. Of Speech. and, 1 Of the preparation
to it.


1 By prayer to God to guide our tongue and that, because

First, the Lord is the ruler of it. Prou. 16. 1.

Secondly, By an holy consideration of these things,

1 That we are to speak in his presence. Psalm. 33. 15.

2 That there is no liberty for idle talk. Mat. 12. 36.

3 That all speech must tend to edification. Ephesians. 4 29.

4 What the matter is, we mean to speak of.

5 That, what is once out cannot be recalled.

6 That we must give an account for every idle word. And thus we shall be
prepared to Speak. Now

The matter of our speech concerns either Persons, Sect. 8. The matter of
speech.
or Things. The persons.

1 Almighty God and his works.

2 Our neighbor, and what concerns him.

3 Our persons and occasions:

In our speech concerning our blessed God, Sect. 9. How to speak of God.
we are to observe these rules:

1 That we take not the names of Gods Majesty in our mouths, but upon most
serious and weighty occasions. Exodus 20.

2 That in the occasion we find our hearts lively affected with a true
knowledge of holy reverence of God, before whom we speak, and before we use
his great and fearful name, lest otherwise though the cause be weighty, yet
we take it in vain.

3 That we find our selves comforted, and established in our faith by taking
of this great, and glorious name, as being hereby drawn nerer unto God, and
settled more constantly in our love of his Majesty. To this end use not the
name of God without some addition of his attributes, as the Living Lord, the
Glorious God, My God, etc. Ephesians. 1. 3.

4 Take we heed that the name of God become not ordinary, and for custom.

5 Publish we the works of God not only for the present, but to posterity
Exodus ^4. 26.

Concerning our neighbor, Sect. 4. How to speak of our neighbor.
our speech may be either good, or evil.

If we are to speak good of our neighbor, then we must do it:

1 Cherefully, and upon every fit occasion. Luke 5. 29.

2 Wisely, rather in his absence then in his presence.

3 Indifferently, as well if he be our foe as friend.

4 Constantly, maintaining the same testimony without any corruption or
gaine-saying.

5 Truly, that we give him no more nor less then his due.

6 Charitably, if the matter be doubtful, rather with the better. 1. Cor. 13.
7.

7 Preserve we his good name by answering for him in a case of slander. 1. Sam
20. 32.

8 If he be fallen, raise we him up with the spirit of meeknes. Gal. 6. 1.

Here are to be avoided these extremes:

First, Sect. 15. What here to be avoided.
those that are in the defect: as

1 Deprauing of the actions of our brethren from the intent. Job 1. 9. 11. as
if we knew their hearts.

2 Extenuating of them in the measure.

3 Mistaking them in the quality, which is the common practice of the world to
call good evil, and evil good. Esaias. 5. 19.

4 Outfacing and bearing men down in there sincerity, and if were possible to
drive them from the same. Job 4. 8. 11. etc.

5 Misiudging of it by the outward event. Job 27.

6 Co^uincing thereof by false witness and perjury. 1. Reg. 20. etc.

7 Disgracing spiritual gifts for want of natures complement. 1. Sam. 1. 14.

Secondly, We must here take heed of the other extreme in the excess: As

1 Commending them to their faces.

2 Ascribing that unto them which is not theirs. Act. 12.

3 Yelding more unto them indeed then is theirs.

4 Daubing up their sins with untempered mortar. Eze. 13. as presumpton of
Gods mercy or such like.

5 Crying peace, peace, and putting far off the evil day. Ier. 6.

6 Approving them for the gifts of nature, though they be not sanctified. Pro
31. 30.

7 Flattering them as if what they had came by their own industry.

8 Saying as they say, be it true or false. Mich. 2. 11.

And thus is our speech to be ordered when we will speak good of our
neighbor.

If we have occasion to speak the contrary of him, let us consider these
bounds:

First, we must not speak what we certainly know not, but have by reports,
surmises, etc.

We may speak that to himself which we must not speak of him to another.
Matt. 18. 15.

Secondly, we must not speak all what we know: unless we have an especial
calling hereunto:

And that is,

1 When the Magistrate requires it.

2 When his case by admonishment needs it.

3 When danger to others thereby is prevented, as in case of murder, treason,
etc. 2. King. 6. 8. Genesis 37. 2. Est: 2.

Hence it follows:

First, That auricular confession is abominable, which binds to the
concealment of such wickedness.

Secondly, That it is sin to discover where we are bound to conceal.

As in cases hereafter laid down.

Thirdly, We must not speak that of our neighbor which we know and is
necessary to be known to all persons, as neither,

To the weak, lest they stumble at it; nor to the wicked, lest they insult in
the infirmities of others. Genesis 8. 2. Sam. 1.

Fourthly, Some may speak that evil of their brethren which it is not lawful
for others. As the Magistrate or Minister in reproouing of sin may abase the
persons with names sorting with their sins. Galla. 4. 1. Matthew. 3. which
private men may nor do.

5 If it be thought fit to mention the evil which we know by any man, here
first it must be done only in a general manner, the person and all
circumstances which will descrie the parson concealed. 1. Cor. 6. 11. 2. Sam.
12. 1.

6 The party also in some cases may be discovered, but yet with a double
respect:

First, if his sin be of infirmity, here we may in some sort conceal the
sin. As

1 That it might be mistaken in regard of the person. Acts 3. 17.

2 That the fact may be misreported and falsely conceived etc.

If we see the party ashamed, and cast down for his sin, here we are bound
much more to cover it, And that

1 From God by hearty prayer, that it may be forgiven. Acts 7. Matthew. 27.

Secondly, From our selves, And that

1 By not taking notice of it willingly.

2 Not believing it.

3 Interpreting it to the best.

4 Forgiving it, if it be apparent.

3 We must also hide the sin from the sinner. And that

First, If we see him unfit to be reproved. 1. Sam. 25.

Secondly, If we see him sufficiently checked already by his conscience, then
we must also hide his sin from him. And that

1 By opposing his contrary intent. Act. 3. 17. Romans 10. 2.

2 Comforting him, with his former course of holiness.

3 From the occasion, that it was in his heat, or provoked thereto in his
defense.

4 From the quality, that it was in ignorance, not wilfulnes, infirmity, not
presumption.

5 From Gods mercy, which is above all his sin. Romans 5. 20.

6 Age, that it was done in his youth. Psalm. 25. 7.

7 The time of life, that yet there is hope to recover. Psalm. 95. 2. Tim. 2.
25. and that it was but the first in that kind.

8 From the examples of the Saints, the best of whom have had their slips. Iam.
3. 2 Psalm. 19.

9 From his person, opposing other good parts to counteruaile that evil. 1.
Kin. 15. 5.

Thus may we hide the sin from the sinner, and thus also may we hide his
sin from the world.

If the sin be grievous and cannot be excused, yet here we must moderate our
speech:

1 And prepare mercy for the party.

2 Acknowledge we it might have been our case, if God should have left us,
and so may be. Galat. 6. 1.

3 Intimating his sorrow and detestation of the fact, as the truth shall be. 2.
Cor. 2. 6, 7.

4 Recounting circumstances that induced thereunto, though not to excuse
altogether, yet to diminish the same, or at least to make known the
deceitfulnes of sin.

5 Labor his outward release from the hope of the time to come.

6 Howsoever; commend his case to the Church in prayer, and also in thy private
unto God.

If the fact be such as must needs be punished, yet here we are:

1 To lay it soundly to the conscience of the offender, to bring him to
repentance, that so the sin may be killed in him. 1. Cor. 5. 5.

2 To raise him up with the sweet comforts of the Gospel, that so though his
body smart for it, yet his soul may be saved. 1. John 1. 9. 1. Cor. 5.

Thus are we to speak concerning our neighbor: Sect. 13. How to speak of our
selves, and
Now concerning our selves, there are these rules:

1 We must neither praise nor dispraise our selves, but leave it to another.
Pro. 27. 2.

2 In some cases we may and must stand upon our own approbatio^. 1 In praise
As

1 When we make profession of our faith. 1. Pet. 3.

2 In Thankefulnes we acknowledge Gods graces in us. 1. Cor. 14. 18.

3 We must defend our innocence. 2. Cor. 11. 12. and

4 Justify also our calling against the slanders of our adversaries to the
stopping of their mouths.

5 Hereby we may comfort our selves in troubles. Psalm. 35. 13. 12.

6 And propose our selves examples unto others. 1. Cor. 11. 1. 14.

Here these caueats are to be observed:

1 That this be done sincerely as well acknowledging our infirmities as the
graces of God in us.

2 That in doing hereof we rather, if it may be, take occasion to speak in
another man's persons. 2. Cor. 12. 1. 2.

3 That we boast not of that which is not in us.

4 We must not speak of the good we have, as if it were from our selves. 1.
Cor. 15. 10.

5 Our speech must rather tend to the defect then to the excess.

6 We must do it soberly and sparingly, rather showing that we are compelled
thereunto then of our own accord. 2. Cor. 11.

7 We must here especially regard how we are made manifest to the conscience of
the saints. 2. Cor. 4.

8 And lastly we must herein especially aim at Gods glory. 1. Cor. 10. 31.

Thus may we speak good of our selves.

3 We are also bound to speak evil of our selves, in these cases,

1 We must confess our sin unto man, in that hereby we may clear others and
give glory to God. 2 In dispraise.
Ios. 7.

2 Hereby also we ease our own souls. Psalm. 32. 45. Iam. 5.

3 We magnify the mercies of God in recounting how unworthy we are. 1. Tim. 1.

4 We stay up others that have been overtaken with the same tentations, etc. 2.
Cor. 1. 4.

But here observe these cautions:

1 We are not bound to accuse our selves to the betraying of our innocence, or
the truth of God, or his children.

2 we may not open our infirmities to the disgrace of our calling, or offense
of others.

3 we must take heed of hypocrisy, as if by acknowledging our vileness, we
would be counted conuerts, as Ecebolius did.

4 That we labor to hide what we have laid open, by casting our burden upon
Jesus Christ.

Thus may we speak of the evil that is in us. And thus much concerning the
persons of whom we must speak. Concerning things to be spoken, observe,

1 That we cannot speak of all, Sect. 14. Of things to be spoken of.
because we know but in part, and therefore it is vanity to presume thus. 1.
Cor. 13.

2 That we may not speak of all we know: Because,

1 Some things are known to us which are neither fit to be done nor spoken, as
the vain thoughts of our own hearts. 2. Cor. 12.

2 Some things are lawful to be done, which it is not lawful to speak of, as
the secrets and necessity of nature. Judges. 3. 24.

3 Some things are lawful, but not fit to be spoken: such as either exceed
the capacities of those to whom we speak, or are not suitable to them. 2. Cor.
12. Hebrew. 5. 11. 1. Cor. 14.

3 We must speak what we know, but with these conditions:

1 That we keep our selves within the compass of our callings.

2 That we speak from the holy purpose of the heart.

3 That we labor herein the glory of God. 1. Cor. 10. 31.

4 And also the good of our neighbor. Ephesians. 4. 29.

5 Yea our own increase both in knowledge and holiness. 1. Cor. 14. 26. 40.

6 Observing the fitnes of time, place, persons, etc.

Thus may we speak of such things as do occure. And thus far concerning the
matter of our speech.

Touching the manner thereof.

First, Our speech in general must be gracious, Sect. 15 The manner of
speech, and 1 It must be gracious.
which is, when the graces of God imprinted in the heart, are truly pictured
in the tongue. Col. 4. 6.

Hence it follows:

1 That all rotten and ungracious speech is disclaimed.

2 No vice must be spoken of, but with dislike. Revel. 2.

3 No gracious speech, but from a gracious heart.

Secondly, Speech is then gracious, when it is seasoned with wisdom. Act. 2.
4.

And this is when our speech is applied:

1 Fitly to times, places, persons, circumstances. Pro. 19. 11. Pro. 10. 31.
Esaias 50. 5.

2 When it profits most to the good of men's souls.

3 When it turns not to the hurt of the speaker. 2. Tim. 2. 16.

4 When it proceeds from a wise and understanding heart. Eccle. 12. 11.

Hence is disclaymed,

1 All foolish talk, wanting reason and conscience. Ephesians. 5.

2 All carnal counsel of worldlings, whatsoever show of wisdom it has in
it. 1. Sam. 17.

3 All unseasonable and indiscreet communication.

4 All mystical, or curious conference, etc. 1. Tim. 6. 20.

A second holy property of speech is:

1 Truth and fidelity. Sect. 16. 2 Our speech must be true.
Ephesians. 4. 25. And it is discerned;

1 When we know what we speak upon a sure ground.

2 We speak as the thing is, the whole truth, and no more.

3 And as himself thinks plainly thereof, not out of others conceits.

4 And also to the mind and purpose of him that asks.

5 And that to have the truth boulted out, not obscured.

6 When we stand to that we have spoken or promised, which that we may do,

Here consider diverse evidences and bonds of truth, As

First, Sect. 17 Of the bonds of truth. 1 Evidences.
A simple assertion, which is either,

1 A simple affirmation, Yea, Yea. Matthew. 5.

2 Or a bare negation, Nay, Nay, Here observe,

1 That in a doubtful case we must add unto our affirmations (these
qualifications: ( As I think, As I take it,) because words thus spoken, if
they prove true, they show the modesty of the speaker: If false, yet they save
his credit, as showing that there is not a purpose to deceive, but only that
we were deceived.

2 Another evidence of Truth is, an Asseueration, whereby we do vehemently
deny or affirm a thing, as In very truth, Without al doubt, etc. Here note,

1 That this is not to be used but in weighty and urgent occasions.

2 When there is a gain saying of what we affirm. Christ says, Amen, Amen.

3 When we are to convince incredulous and obstinate persons. Romans 9. 1. And
thus far of the Evidences of Truth.

A first bond of truth is a promise. Sect. 18. Of Promise.


Here observe:

1 What promises we must make.

2 How they are to be kept, and how they bind.

The promises we are to make to men, must be such as,

1 Be conditionable, asking God leave. Iam. 4. 15.

2 Be of such things as are in our ability to perform.

3 Such as may benefit the party to whom we make promise.

4 And also may stand with conscience and credit to perform.

And thus they bind with these bonds:

1 They bind according to the will and pleasure of him to whom it is made.
Psalm. 15. though it be to our own hinderance.

2 Yet so, if by necessary casualty we are disinabled to performance, the
party to whom the promise is made, in conscience is to give some relaxation.
Mat. 18.

3 To this end we are bound to crave relief, and use holy wisdom, and
submission thereto. 2 Bonds. Sect. 19
Pro, 6. 1, 2.

A second bond of truth, is an Oath. An Oath.
Here observe,

1 The lawfulnes thereof, 1 The lawfulnes.


1 Because God has commanded it. Esaias 45. 23.

2 It is a special part of his worship. Esaias 19. 18.

3 The Saints have practiced it holily. Genesis 31. 53.

4 It has procured much good and been accepted of God. 1. Chr. 15.

2 Consider we the matter of an oath, 2 The matter.


1 It must not only be true, but so known to us. Ier. 4. 2.

2 It must be honest that we swear to.

3 It must be a truth of great importance.

3 Observe we the manner of an oath, 3 The manner.
as

1 It must be made in the only name of God.

1 By invocation of his name, to witness the truth of what we swear.

2 And to bless us therein.

2 By imprecation against our selves, whereby we bind our selves if we deceive,
to the vengeance of God.

3 It must be done, not rashly, but with great aduisement.

4 And also with great reverence and feeling, not without prayer unto God to
guide the heart. Eccl. 9. 2.

Fourthly, The true and lawful swearer is indeed

1 The regenerate man, 4 He that may swear
whoh has right in this service, and knows how to use it aright. To. 2. and
none other.

2 And he must also have a particular calling to this service.

3 Here learn, that though the party in regard of his general calling might
not swear, yet his oath being made, is lawful, if he have a civil calling
thereto, and may be taken howsoever the swearer herein be not justified.

5 The right use and end of an oath is: 5 The end.


1 To end controversies between man and man, and free those that are wrongfully
accused.

2 To clear our innocence before men. Heb. 6. 16.

3 To provide for the infirmities of men. 1. Sam. 12. 5. Genesis 31. 53.

4 To witness a truth unto men.

5 Bind our selves more constantly to the service of God. Nehe. 10. 1. Chron.
15. 23.

Sixthly, 6 Before whom we must swear.
Consider we the parties before whom we may swear, which are;

1 The Magistrate, who may lawfully exact an oath.

2 To a private man we may also swear to bind contracts.

3 The Master may require an oath of the servant. Genesis 24. and so the Father
of the son, the husband of the wife, etc. one friend of another.

Seventh, 7 When
Observe we the time of an oath, which is:

1 In a case of necessity, when witness fail, or words will not be taken.

Hence it follows:

1 That we need not swear when the party to whom we swear is not willing to
accept it.

2 And neither also, if the matter may be cleared by any other awful means.

Eighthly, Learn we how an oath binds. 8 How an oath binds


1 If it be imposed by him that may lawfully give it.

2 If it be made of things lawful.

3 If it tend to our own and neighbors good.

4 When Gods glory also is prepared thereby.

9 Wisely consider we the abuses of an oath, 9 The abuses of an oath.
which are:

1 Swearing by Images, trifles, Saints, nullities, etc. Zep. 1. 5.

2 Swearing ordinarily in common speech, or upon heat in gaming, etc. Ier. 5.
7. Mat. 5.

3 Rash swearing, when we know not the cause, or have no calling thereto, or
advise not wisely in the action.

4 Muthering of oaths, when we say gods for God, fect for faith, swounds, for
wounds, etc. where hoping to escape the imputation of swearing, we are more
guilty thereof.

5 Outrageous and blasphemous swearing the badge of ruffians, and rake-hels.

6 Cursed swearing, with fearful imprecations against our selves and others.

7 Wicked swearing, when we bind our selves by oaths to mischief. Acts 2. 3.

8 False swearing, when we swear to that ignorantly which proves false.

9 Perjury, when we knew a thing to be false, and yet will swear to it of set
purpose to do mischief. Zach. 5. 4.

10 Swearing for hire to any purposes. Acts 6.

11 When we swear to impossibilities, as when the Priest is sworn by the
Bishop to the vow of continency.

Generally here is condemned:

First, Al kind of lying, Sect. 20. Of Lying.
upon what pretense soever. Now a lie is then made,

1 When we speak falsely.

2 And are willing so to do. 2. Rings 5.

3 Purpose to deceive thereby, Acts 5.

Hence it follows, that all

1 False speaking of ignorance is no lie.

Secondly, Here is condemned all smoothing and dissembling of a matter, Sect.
21. Of flattery.
(either) with purpose to deceive.

1 By extenuating of it.

2 By exercising the fact.

3 By using pretexts and shifts to avoid it.

4 By mental reservation and such like Jesuitical and Atheistical tricks.

Thirdly, Sect. 22. Concealing of truth.
Also all concealing of truth, when we are bound to speak, is here forbidden.

4 All ambiguous and doubtful speeches.

5 To speak untruths, though not with purpose to deceive.

6 All promise-breaking when the promise is lawfulfully made.

And thus far concerning the second grace of speech, which is Truth:

A third grace of holy speech is Reverence. Sect. 23. The third grace of,
speech. Reverence, and that 1 In respect of God.
And this is in regard, either of,

First God, of whose name and titles we must so speak that we both,

1 Show reverence our selves, and

2 Move reverence in others. Deuteronomy. 28. 58.

And this we shall do:

1 If we know God aright.

2 And fear him as our father: Malach. 1.

3 Behold him in his judgments upon the wicked. Psalm. 119. 120.

4 Think often and meditate upon him. 2 Of man.


Secondly, we must use reverence in speech in regard of man, and that either
generally as he bears Gods image. So we must,

1 Give holy names unto our children: Sect. 24. To give holy names to to our
children.
But here with sobriety, not the names of God, as Jesuits, etc. but such as,

1 May show our thankefulnes to God. Genesis 41.

2 May show our true humiliation under his corrections. Ruth. 1.

3 May put us in mind of his promises. Israel. Genesis 32.

4 May remember us of our own frailty and wretchedness. Adam, Genesis 32.

5 May intimate our time, estate and condition in this life. Ester. 2. 5.

6 May encourage us to the hope of the life to come.

7 May minister comfort in our troubles, and such like.

2 We must not name professors by the names of profane men.

3 We may change names upon just occasion.

2 We are to use reverence in more particular manner unto man, Sect. 25.
Reverence to our superior.
as he is our superior either in calling or gifts. 1. Cor. 12. 13. provided,

1 That we give him not the titles of God as Iehoua etc.

2 Give him the titles of his office though he be evil. Acts. 26. 25.

3 And yet here so carry our selves as that we may humble him in the
performance thereof.

Therefore here is forbidden:

1 All manner of blasphemy; Here forbidden, 1 Basphemie.
which is either, First by detracting ought from God.

2 Or ascribing to him that which beseems him not.

3 Using his great and fearful names in our fumes and rage.

4 Inuocating him also in slight and customary matters.

5 Using the names of God to socery, 2 Abuse of scripture.
witchcraft.

All abuse of Scripture: And this is either,

1 When we have no calling to use it. 1. Cor. 14. 34.

2 We speak of the things of God in a profane and carnal manner* 1. Cor. 2.

3 When we make jests thereof.

4 When we keep back any of Gods counsel and clip the word of God. Math. 4.
Act. 20.

5 When we use it to sorcery.

6 And when we reason and cavil about the truth thereof.

3 All abuse of our selves or others: 2^ Abuse of our selves.
Either,

1 By reuilings and barbarous speeches.

2 Cursing and banning. Col. 3. 8.

3 Scoffing and scorning each other. Psalm. 1. 2. Kings 2. especially for our
profession and religion.

4 Not using titles of honor. etc.

5 Currish and dogged speech etc. And thus far of the third grace of speech,
which is reverence. A fourth grace of speech is sobriety, modesty, Sect. 26. A
fourth grace of speech Sobriety, and Modesty. And wherein.
or meekenes. And this is ^eene.

1 In praising others, and that rather behind their backs then before their
faces.

2 In praising and dispraysing our selves, as before.

3 In speaking of things secret which may move blushing fairly. Genesis 4. 1. 1.
1. Sam. 24. 4.

4 Conferring with inferiors tenderly and humbly.

5 Saluting kindly and reverently. And that,

1 By name. Romans 16.

2 By profession. Romans 16. 3. Sect. 27. Of salutations.


3 Calling or office.

4 By way of blessing. Ro^. 16. 24.

5 Praying for the blessing of God upon them.

Here observe:

1 That it is lawful for children to invoke the blessing of their parents.
Genesis 27. Genesis 48.

2 That we may salute generally though the person be evil, so far as we
may converse with him, giving the titles of his profession, calling, etc. Genesis
34. Acts. 26.

3 That we avoid such blessing and charitable speeches (as we account them)
when the cause is not necessary, as in neesing. etc.

4 Whereas it is common with the Popish and Ignorant to invoke the name of
God over their cattle so often as they speak thereof, Popish blessing to be
moderated.
this is to be moderated and refrayned. And that,

1 Because the ground thereof was sorcery.

2 They use it more often for their cattle then themselves.

3 It maintains that Popish customary abusing of such holy names.

4 It shows our infidelity, for if we were persuaded that God has received us
into grace, then surely also all ours; and therefore what need such often
inuocations?

This meekenes of speech is seen in soft answering. Sect. 28. Of soft
answering.
Proverbs 15. 25. And that,

Secondly, not a fool according to his foolishnes. Proverbs 26. 3.

Thirdly, in a just defense of our selves. 1. Samuel 1. 15. Anna.

Fourthly, commending our cause to God. Psalm. 26.

This grace of speech is especially seen in reproouing of sin. Sect. 28. Of
reproof of sin.
Here observe these rules:

1 We must try all other gentle means before we reprove.

2 We must perform it generally, that so the party may willingly acknowledge
the particular. 2. Sam. 12.

3 We must do it in a parable.

4 By way of exhortation insinuating an oblique reproof 1. Tim. 5. 1.

5 Wrapping up the reproof in some sweet protestations of love and grief.
Galat. 5. 9.

4 Yielding unto them their due, that so they may acknowledge their wants.
Acts. 25.

6 Joining our selves with them, and in our own person reproouing their sin.
1. Cor. 4. 6.

7 By prevention; as Though Israel play the harlot, yet let not Judah sin.
Hos. 4. 15.

8 Wishing that such things be not found among them. 2. Cor. 12. 20.

9 Speaking to them as considering our selves. Gal. 6. 1. That we are in
danger of the same tentations.

10 Framing the reproof out of the word, that the party may see himself
rather reproved of God then of us.

And thus far of the fourth grace of speech, which is meekenes and modesty.

A fifth grace of speech is cheerefulnes and joy, Sect. 30. A fifth grace of
Speech is cheerefulnes and joy. It conditions.
when we use delightful speech for recreation. Eccles. 3. 4.

Here is to be observed:

1 That it must be seasoned with Gods fear. Eccles. 2. 2.

2 It must be with compassion for those that are in affliction. Am. 6. 6.

3 It must be sparing and moderate. 2. Tim. 3.

4 It must not be mixed with sin. Hebr. 11. 25.

5 It must tend to edification. 1. Cor. 10.

6 It must be suitable to the time.

7 It must also be fitted to the place, which is either the board or bed.

For the board observe:

1 The intent, How fitted to the board.
the which is to hinder other idle and profane talk.

2 To season the company with better.

3 To prevent gluttony.

4 A desire to catch spiritually.

5 To sanctify the creatures.

2 Consider the matter of table talk. Which,

1 Especially must be of religion. Luke 11. 35.

2 That which is incident hereunto, As,

First of sobriety and such examples.

2 Gods special providence and bounty in making a dead creature means to
preserve life. Joel 2. 26. Haggai. 1. 6.

3 Contentation in our estate. 1. Tim. 6.

4 Death, how that we shall be worms meat.

5 Of the heavenly food. Ioh. 4.

6 Misery of the poor.

7 Change of things and states. Job 1.

8 The punishment of sin, the case of Dives, etc. Luke 16.

For the bed; How to the bed.
let these be the rules of holy mirth.

1 We must confer of the grave. Acts 7.

2 Of the occasions passed in the day. Cant. 3. 1.

3 Of the resurrection.

4 Of worldly occasions, so far as to humble us.

5 In our comforts of our sweet fellowship with Christ.

6 Generally, not to provoke but to mortify the flesh. Galathian. 5. 13.

Here is to be avoided generally,

1 All offense to the weak. Here to be avoided:


2 All occasion to the wicked:

As in

First, Jesting, Jesting, with it bounds.
which is a quipping of some to delight others, wherein a man had rather lose
his friend then his jest.

This is utterly unlawful, unless.

1 The matter be indifferent. 2 The measure modest. 3 The season convenient. 4
Offense removed. 5 Our selves, and others benefited 6 We thereby, when other
reproves will not prevail, in an holy manner do deride and scorn sinners.
1. Reg. 19. Eccles. 11.
Secondly, laughter, 2 Laughter.
which though in it self it be not simply unlawful, yet it is moderately
to be used, and seldom; but sorrow more often, and more plentifully. Eccl. 7.
4. 5.

The sixth grace of speech is care of our neighbors good name. Sect. 31. A
sixth grace of speech, Care of our neighbors good^ name.
Pro. 22.

This is performed as before, and farther,

1 By being not suspicious in unlikely or uncertain occasions. Ier. 40.

2 By private reproving him.

3 Publicly answering for him if he be slandered. 1 How performed. 2 What
avoided.


Here is to be avoided:

1 Secret whispering abroad of what we suspect or know behind his back. Psalm.
50. 20.

2 Adding to, or changing the thing said or done. Mat. 26. 60, 61.

3 Open traducing and reuiling to his face. 2. Sam. 16.

4 Telling that was never done. Ierem. 37. 13.

5 Coloring their reports with pretenses of grief or necessity, or public
profit, inioyning secrecy by the party to whom he tells it, etc.

6 Rash censuring before evident knowledge.

Therefore here we are,

1 To interrupt such talk. Sect. 32. The last grace of speech: slownes and
briefnes.
2 To give no heed to it. 3 Not to believe it. 4 To reprove it.
The seventh and last grace of speech, is slownes and briefness.

Slownes is seen either in First, Provoking; or Secondly, Answering.

Herein observe:

1 That it is better to be provoked to speech then provoke, especially if we be
inferior.

2 Not to take a tale out of ones mouth, but to hear it thoroughly.

3 To consider whither it be to be answered or no.

4 To ponder on it before we answer, what answer is to be made thereto.

5 To answer to the points, omitting partial respects.

6 To cut off idle interruptions and vain cauils.

Here is to be avoided:

1 Pride to hear a man's self speak.

2 The fruit thereof, namely: First, Obscurity. Secondly, Affectation.


2 We must avoid tempting speeches whereby we may fifth and undermine others.

4 As also that spirit of contradiction, whereby thwarting others and
contradicting every man, heresy, and Atheism is bredde and maintained.

5 We must also refrain bitterness and captious taking up of our brother, a
fault incident to briefenes of speech.

6 As also we must beware of sottishnes, and inconsequence of speech, while
happily we think to show our skill in brevity.

Hitherto appertain:

1 Restrayning of our passion, by interrupting our selves, if by course of
speech we grow into an heat.

2 Correcting our selves by silence wherein we have missaid.

3 Contracting our matter into the briefest form of words.

4 Disposing it methodically to the best capacity of the hearer.

General rules to be observed herein.

1 That what is here spoken of speech is to be understood also of writing, in
which all these graces are to be practiced, and vices to be avoided.

2 That in all kind of speech, as well Latin as English, etc. exemplarie, as
wherein though the phrases of other tongues may lead us to prophanenes, yet we
must avoid them, etc.

Hitherto of speech. Sect. 33. Of silence and the right use thereof.


Now because we cannot speak well unless we know also how to hold our peace,
we are therefore in the second place to consider of silene. Here obseru:

1 That the ruleof silence must be Gods word.

2 Matter of silence, concerns God, our neighbor, our silnes.

3 Persons, before whom. Things to be concealed. And first, wherein silence is
to be used.


4 The end, which is Gods glory, ours and others good.

Things concerning God, are:

1 His secrets which we know not, and therefore are to admire them in silence.
Deuteronomy. 29. 29.

2 His strange and extraordinary works, which we may not speak boldly of, but
rather in silence wonder at. Job 36. 37. Leuit. 10. 3.

3 We are to conceal the mercies of God from obstinate sinners. Matthew. 7. 6.

4 We are to conceal his judgments from humbled sinners. Esaias 40. 1.

5 We are to be silent at his corrections. Psalm. 39. hereby showing our
submission to his will.

6 We are to yield to the known truth, and in silence to glorify God. Act. 11.
18. 2 Concerning


Touchi^g our neighbor, observe

2 That we may conceal some truth from him, not being demanded, yea being
questioned we may conceal either the whole or part: Provided that it,

1 Hinder Gods glory.

2 Or my neighbors good.

Truth in the whole is to be concealed:

1 When the speaking of the least word is hurtful: as for example, the father
and son lies sick at once, the son dies first, the father asks whether the
son be dead or no, if it be said; No, an untruth is told; if yea the fathers
life is endangered: 3 What to be concealed. Aug lib. ad conser.
therefore silence is best. 2. Sam. 12.

2 When the revealing thereof endangers the life of the innocent; and therefore
I am not to reveal my brethren in affliction, nor to be compelled thereto by
oath:

Provided first, that the authority requiring this be unlawful.

2 The thing I conceal not in it self evil; but so mistaken.

3 That in the co^cealing of it I prefer not a private before a public good.

Truth in part is to concealed, when I speak a part of the truth but not the
whole. 1. Sam. 16. 1. 23. Ier. 38. 24. Exodus 5. Act. 23. 6.

Q. When I am demanded may I answer in part?

Yea so 1. I purpose not to deceive.

2 Co^te^t the mind of the answerer.

Secondly, I am to conceal the infirmities of my neighbor, unless (as
before) we be called of God to speak. Prou. 17. 14. Pro. 19. 11.

3 All unseemly matters,

4 Such as concern us not,

5 And such as are above our reach, are to be buried in silence.

3 Ministers must conceal the infirmities of their people.

4 Magistrates secrets of state left the enemy know of them.

Concerning my self, I am,

1 To conceal mine own secrets. Iud. 14. or else, if need be, tell those
that are faithful.

2 That which thou would have no man know tell no man.

As for the persons before whom we must keep silence, 4 Before whom we must
keep silence.
they are,

1 The malicious enemies of religion Mat. 7. 6. Mat. 27. 14.

2 Before Magistrates in open courts. Act. 24. 10. til we be bidden.

3 In the presence of our elders and betters. Job 32. 8.

4 Fools and pratlers are to be humbled and co^uicted with file^ce. Pr. 26.

Thus far concerning the guidance of the tongue.

The sixth and last part of this Girdle of truth contains the fitting and
conforming of our outward actions to the will of God, Sect. 34. Last part of
the Girdle Conformtiy of outward actions.
which is performed:

1 When they proceed from a true ground.

2 And are performed by true means and a holy manner.

3 When they aim at a right end.

The ground of all good actions is faith in Jesus Christ. Romans 14. Heb. 11. 6.

1 Assuring us that our persons are accepted of God, The ground of them, Faith.
and so our actions. Heb. 11. 4.

2 Enabling us to perform the work acceptably unto God in knowledge, wisdom,
season Psa. 1.

3 Comforting us that the imperfection of the action shall not be laid to our
charge. 2. Cor. 8. 12.

4 Applying unto us the righteousness of Jesus Christ to cover the same. Psalm.
32.

5 Strengthing us to go forward in well doing, and so to attain perfection,
and so the just lives by faith. Heb. 10. 38.

In the manner of weldoing observe these notes:

1 That we principally perform the actions of the first table, 2 The manner
how.
and then of the second. Act. 4. 19.

2 That our obedience to the second table be included and derived from our
obedience to the first. Math. 22. 39. Ephesians. 6. 1.

3 That in regard of the truth and necessity of well-doing we have equal
respect unto all Gods commandments. Psalm. 119. 9.

4 That we at all times and to al times endeavor the performance there of Gal.
6. Ephesians. 6.

5 That in the action we labor not so much the outward conformity thereof, as
the inward soundnes and approbation of the heart. Mat. 6. 7.

6 That we do good by good means; that is, such as are warranted by the word.
etc.

7 That we find in our selves a will always to do more then we can do.

rest in the present estate, forget that which is behind, and hasten to that
which is before Phil. 3. 12. 13.

9 That when we have done all we can, we acknowledge our selves to be
unprofitable servants. Luke 17. 10.

10 That hereupon we seek not salvation by our works, but by Gods mere mercy
in Jesus Christ Phil. 3.

11 That we be that we seem to be.

12 That we make conscience of the least as well as of the greatest.

13 That we provide things honest before men, as well as in the sight of God.

The end of our actions is,

1 That whatsoever we do it be done to Gods glory. 3 The end what, Gods glory.
1. Cor. 10. 31. and this is performed:

1 In sanctifying and auspicating them by prayer and invocation of the name of
God. 1. Tim. 4.

2 In returning the strength of them to the worship of God, in causing our
light to shine before men. Mat. 5. 20. Prou. 5. 10.

3 In all things, and in every issue of them, both giving thanks to God the
father through Jesus Christ.

4 Being abased before the Lord in regard of our unworthiness to do him any
service, as also of the unworthiness of the service we do perform.

5 Acknowledging that nothing is due unto us but shame and confusion of our
faces. Dan. 9.

6 desiring to be found in Christ, not having our own righteousness which is of
the law, but that which is by the faith of Christ Phil. 3. 9.

Secondly, we must do al things to edification both of our selves and others. 2
Edification how accomplished.


Here observe:

1 That the less benefit must give place to the greater.

2 That in all things next to Gods glory, our chief aim must be the
salvation of the soul. 1. Cor. 16.

3 That more regard be had of those which are within, then which are without,
Gal. 6. 10. 1. Cor. 6. and yet the good of none neglected.

4 That of those which are within we have more respect to the weak in cases of
indiffere^cie. To. 14. To. 15. 1.

5 That our conversation be answerable to our profession. Ephesians. 4. 1.

6 That we have as well strong meat for men, as milk for babes; not sticking
always in the infancy of our profession, but growing up in Jesus Christ. Heb.
6. 1. Hebr. 13.

7 That we abound in weldoing, and make sure our election by good wokes. 2.
Pet. 1. 8, 9.

8 That we as well cast out the hypocrite and stumbling-blocke, as hold on the
sound Christian. Jeremy 1.

9 We must bring forth fruit in due season, observing the comelines of time,
place, persons, etc. Psalm 1. 3.

This Girdle is put on,

1 By continually setting of our hearts before God, How applied.
for the searching thereof.

2 Trying all our thoughts, words, and actions, by the word.

3 By continual watching over our ways.

4 By earnest prayer to God.

And it is ketton,

1 By not strayning the conscience in the least evil. Heb. 13. 18.

2 By cleaving to the testimony thereof, and rejoicing especially therein. 2.
Cor. 1. 12.

3 By obeying the checks of conscience.

4 Conuincing the hollownesse and hypocrisy of the world.

5 Laboring and approving sinceity in others.

7 Daily fearing our selves, and renewing our covenant with God.

8 Renouncing daily our selves, and flying to Christ.

The use of this Girdle is:

1 We are ready pressed to do Gods will. Benefit of this part of the Girdle
Reu. 1.

3 We are cleared from hypocrisy, which is the moth of weldoing. Mat. 6. Mat.
23.

4 We avoid uncertainty and dulnes in good things.

5 We are preserved from corruption in judgment, and apostasy in life.

6 All other gifts of God are adorned and approved thereby.

7 We are enabled to hold out to the end, and so obtain the crown.

8 The other parts of the spiritual armor are compact in themselves, and
fastened to us by it:

The next whereof is the breast plate of righteousness, or innocence. And this
is,

1 An Inclination and resolution of the heart to all good.

This is necessary:

1 To justify and beautify our profession, Sect. 35. The breast plate of
righteousness.
and make sure our election.

2 That we may be freed from many inward pangs and outward troubles.

3 That the mouths of the wicked may be stopped.

4 That the weak may be confirmed.

5 That those which are without may be gathered.

6 That our perfection may be accomplished and we glorified.

7 That God may be all in all.

And this is discerned:

1 By having righteousness in most precious account. The marks thereof.
Job 1.

2 Esteeming it for it self, not for the reward thereof Job 2. 10.

3 Prosecuting the same with all zeal and courage.

4 Resting therein with delight and contentation.

5 Cleaving thereto, though it cost us the setting on. Hebr. 10. 34.

6 Avoiding the contrary, though it may be never so behouefull unto us.

7 So far as our knowledge informs us practicing the same.

8 Desiring beyond our knowledge perfection therein.

9 Loving others especially for it. Heb. 10. 34.

10 Laboring to make others partakers thereof.

11 Not being removed from the same by any cunning or slanders whatsoever.

This is obtained and put on:

1 By an utter renouncing of nature and all good therein. 3 How it is put on.


2 Laying hold on Christ by a lively faith, and so we bring forth the fruit of
righteousness in him.

And we put it on as our breast plate:

First, by an holy and settled purpose of heart to serve God. Act. 11.

2 By plain and sound dealing in all things.

3 By renewing our decaies by daily repentance, and couenanting with God.

4 By informing our hearts daily out of the word.

5 Preparing our selves daily to tentations.

And it is kept on:

1 By walking always in the presence of God. 4 How Kept on.
Enoch, Abraham.

2 Avoiding the great offenses Psalm. 19.

3 By abstaining from the occasions and appearance of evil. 1. These. 5.

4 By iustifing and maintaining the same, with the loss of all in respect
thereof. Acts. 21. Job. 2.

5 By walking conscionably in the duties of our callings.

6 By trying our faith which is the life thereof. 2. Cor. 13.

7 Undergoing continual troubles for the same.

And to this end serves the third part of this Armor.

This is that our feet be shod with the preparation of the Gospel, Feet shod
with the preparation of the gospel
That is:

In the assurance of our acceptance into the favor of God, through Jesus
Christ, we are armed and prepared:

First, to Deny our selves.

Secondly, to take up the cross of Christ and to follow him. Luke 9. 23.

And this must be done.

1 That troubles find us not unprepared. The use of this part
Job 3. 25.

2 That the fear of them may not dismay us.

3 That we be not overwhelmed with the weight of them. 2. Cor. 4. 8. 9.

4 That our minds may be quieted in the midst of them. Romans 5. 2.

5 That we may be more then conquerours in them. Romans. 8. 24.

6 That we may comfort others which groan under the like burden. 2. Cor. 1. 4.
5.

7 And so finish our course and obtain the crown. 2. Tim. 4.

This armor is put on, How to be attained.
and so kept:

1 By daily reading and meditating on the passion of Christ. Hebr. 12. 2.

2 Giving all diligence to the word preached.

3 Preferring the favor of God in Christ above all things. Psalm 4. 6.

4 Not depending upon things seen, but contemplating things in uisible. Heb.
11. 1.

5 Having our eye fixed on the recompense of the reward, and comparing the
momentary trouble with the surpassing weight of glory Hebr. 11.

And here the shield of faith is of special use, Sect. 37. A fourth part of
the Armor, the shield of faith.
which is the fourth part of this Armor:

And it is a full and strong persuasion of the love of God in Chri^ Jesus, Romans
8. 38. whereby.

1 We beat back all the fier^ darts of the devil, as carnal confidence,
presumption, security, in^^ delity, distrust, credulity, etc.

2 Prize all things at their tr^ worth and prosecute the^ accordingly.

3 We preserve the graces of God and increase them unto us.

4 We follow hard to the mark, and attain perfection. Phil. 3. 13.

This is requisite:

1 To give approbation to alour actions. It use:


2. To give comfort in regard of their imperfections.

3 To enable us in our sufferings. Job. 1. 5.

4 To finish our course and procure us the crown. Hebr. 11. 13. 2. Tim. 4.

5 To overcome tentations, as despair, and presumption of Gods mercy.

6 To obtain a comfortable life.

7 To be prepared unto death.

This is obtained and preserved as before.

A first part of this Armor is the Helmet of hope. Sect. 38. The fifth part,
Helmet of hope,
this is

1 A constant desire of the pro^ised happiness. Mat. 5. 6. Phi. 1. 23. Tim. 4. 8.

2 A cheerful expectation and ^nging after the same.

3 A resigning our selves into the hands of God. Psalm. 5. 12.

The necessity or use hereof is:

1 To sustain the heart against the deferring of Gods promises, 1 The use of
it.
an^ contrary tentations. Heb. 6. 19.

2 That we may maintain inward peace and pass over our pil^grimage without
wearisomnes^^ and anguish.

3 That we may answer boldl^ our accusers. Psalm. 119. 42. and stop the mouths
of gainesayers. Tit. 9^ 2. 8.

4 That we may walk in o^^ callings with singlenes and conten^^ment. 1. Cor.
7. 21.

5 And be contented with whatsoever shall happen unto us other^wise. Romans 8. 28.

6 That we may carry our selue^ as strangers in the world, lookin^ for a city
which is above. Hebrew 11.

7 That we may suffer affliction cheerfully and fruitfully. Psa. 5. 1^ Psalm.
33. 21.

8 That we do purge, and pre^pare our selves to happiness. 1. Io^ ^. 3. Esaias
40. 31.

9 That the Saints may be raised up by our example. Psalm. 69. 7.

10 That we may be delivered out of troubles. Psalm. 37. 40. Psalm 91. 14.

This is obtained and buckled to the head: 2 How to be put on.


1 By sound knowledge of the love of God in Christ. Romans 8. 38.

2 By plentiful experience of the same heretofore. 2. Cor. 1. 10.

3 By embracing al good means that are offered for our safety. Psalm 37. 3.

4 Casting our selves upon the Lord when means fail. ibid. 5 and resting in
him. Prou. 14. 32. Romans ^4.

5 Reverent observing of the works of God. Psalm 40. 4. Psalm. 115. 11.

6 Depending on the truth of Gods promises, though we see them not
accomplished. Psalm. 46. 5. Psalm. 130. 9. Pro. 16. 20.

7 Expecting the Lords leisure, contrary to sense and reason. Psalm. 69. 4. Esaias
26. 8.

8 Abasing and renouncing out selves before the Lord. Psalm. 131. 3. Zeph. 3. 12.

9 Submitting our selves to the ministry of the Gospel. Esaias 50. 10^

10 Waiting further upon God, then this life can counteruaile. 1. Cor. 15. 19.

The last part of this spiritual Armor, Sect. 39 The last part, the sword of
the spirit.
is the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. He. 4. Ps. 149, etc. And
this must be had, First, To diserne:

1 The deceitfulnes of sin. Heb^* 1 It use.
3. 13.

2 The poison of error and heresy. 1. Tim. 6. 3.

3 The corruption of our ow^^ hearts. Heb. 3. 12.

4 The manifold subtilties and deepnes of Satan. Apoc. 2. 24. 2. Pe^^ 1. 19.

5 The riches of Gods mercie^ Ephesians. 3. 18. Ephesians. 1. 18.

Secondly, to confirm and maintain:

1 Faith against infidelity and coffeehouse.

2 Hope against despair. To. 15. 4

3 Truth against error and humane wisdom. I am. 1. 18.

Christ against Antichrist.

4 God against man.

Thirdly, To captiuate and subdue:

4 Our hearts doubtfulnes. Psalm. 73. 17.

5 Man's inventions. Psalm. 119. 113.

This Armor is obtained and put on,

1 By prayer. 2 How obtained.


2 Study and meditation. 1. Tim. 4. 13

3 Submiting our selves to the word preached. Iam. 1. 21.

These means how wrought effectually:

1 When our understanding is illightned, and delighted with the saving
knowledge thereof.

2 Our judgments confirmed, and established in the same. Ephesians. 1. 9.

3 Our consciences convinced, and quieted therein. Romans 5. 1.

4 Our will and affections subdued and captiuated thereto. Psalm. 40. 6.

5 Our desire en flamed and insatiable thereof. Mat. 5. 6.

6 Our mind satisfied and contented therewith, above all treasures. Psalm. 119.
97. Psalm. 19. 10.

7 Our lives reformed and amended thereby. Psalm. 119. 9.

8 Our faith quickened, and daily norished by the same. 2. Pet. 1.

9 And we enabled to overcome tentations, and to finish our course with joy. 3
How keept on.
Psalm. 119. 7. 9.

And this armor is keept one:

1 By recording and rehearsing the same unto other: so to labor their
conversion. Luke 22. 23.

2 By spiritual experience of the power thereof in putting our knowledge into
continual practice.

3 By cleaving constantly to an effectual ministry. John 10. 5.

4 By suffering afflictions for the Gospel. Heb. 10. Act. 21.

5 By laboring to have it to dwell plentifully among us, and to have the power
thereof more and more abound in the mortif^ing of onr affections and special
sins. Colos. 3. 16. Tit. 2. 11.

Thus far of the parts of the Christian armor: Now the necessity in general
of it, Sect. 40. The general benefit of the whole armor.
is that without it, First, In respect of our selves,

1 Our whole life must needs be subject to many fearful breaches and
distractions. 2. Pet. 1.

2 We shall pass it very idly and unprofitably.

3 We shall be deceived with many false shadows, and apparances of good, and
be much to seek in that good which we do desire, either in the knowledge of
it or desire to the same.

4 Our course at the best will be most uncertain. John 11. 10. in regard of
others.

5 We shall not so shine before them as lights by our good examples. Mat. 5. 16.

6 Nay, we shall necessarily in respect of our evil example bee^ stumbling
blocks unto them.

7 We shall cause our profession to be evil spoken of. Ephesian^ 5. 3.

8 And our God, and his Religion and word blasphemed. Timoth^^ 6. 1.

But with this Armor, we shall be,

1 Certain of what we do. John 11. 9.

2 Enabled in some measure (...) do it. Psalm. 119. 104.

3 Strong to encounter all oppositions, and victorious therein. Psa^^ 119. 6.

4 Assured of the acceptance (...) what we do. Phil. 1. 21, 20.

5 Ready for all occasions whatsoever. Phil. 4. 12.

6 And willing to yield up his due unto God when he shall require it. Acts 7.
1. Cor. 1. 7.

And thus much concerning the spiritual Armor.

CHAP. X.
NOW being thus armed, we are prepared to encounter such occasions as occur
in the day, which are generally and necessary: Of the pursuit of God, and the
avoiding of evil.


1 To avoid evil. Esaias 1. 16, 17. 2 To prosecute that which is good.
Concerning the avoiding of evil:

First, we must labor to have our judgment rectified.

Concerning

1 The evil it self.

2 Our own estate in respect of it.

3 God, who hates it and yet orders it.

That which we are to be informed concerning evil, is; that there is evil,
Sect. 1. Difference of evil.


1 By nature, and such is whatsoever is against or besides the law of God, and
this is properly called sin.

2. Accident, so a good thing may be made evil. Psalm. 69. 22. Malach. 2. 2.

3 Opinion, so afflictions are counted evils; yea, the truth and power of good
in the censure of the world, usually is counted evil. Esaias 5. 20.

The use hereof is:

3 That we may discern things that differ, not stumbling upon evil in stead of
good, nor avoiding good in stead of evil, not fearing afflictions when they
come for good, not distrusting our goodness, though it be accounted evil.
Phil. 1. 10.

2 We must understand the true author of evil, which is not God, but our
selves, that so we may blame none but our selves. James 1. 13. Sect. 2 What
the evil of it is.


3 That evil is not only a mere privation of good, but a quality inhere^t and
defiling the soul. 1. Ioh. 3. 4

4 That it is not only committed in act, but in thought, though consent come
not thereto. Exo. 20.

5 That it is as well committed in omitting what we should do, as in doing
what we should not.

6 That sin is seen in the least that is forbidden, as well as in the
greatest. 1. John 3. 4.

That the least sin breaks the law of God, and makes us guilty of the
whole. James 2. 12. Ephesians. 5. 11, 12. Romans 6. 21.

8 That sin is filthy and loathsome even in the greatest pleasure and act
thereof.

9 That the end thereof is bitter, and the inward parts most abominable.

And this knowledge serves,

1 To conclude all under sin. Romans 3. 9. Sect. 3. The use of this knowledge.


2. To lay the fault justly where it is.

3 To prevent diminishing and increasing of sin.

4 To avoid the custom and punishment thereof.

Concerning our own estate in respect of sin, we are to learn:

1 That if we never committed sin, yet we are not free from it, as being guilty
of the sin of another, and deriuing it from the loins of our parents* Romans 5.
14. Psalm. 51. 5. Ephe. 2. 3.

2 That hereby our nature is wholly tainted with corruption, and uncleanness.
Job 14. Psalm 51.

3 That we are deprived of all original and actual righteousness. Ephesians. 2.
Romans 6. Sect. 4. How far sin has taken hold on man.


4 And proone, yea desperately set to commit all sin with greedines. Genesis 6.

5 That we delight in sin, and repose our chief contentment therein. Pro. 2.

That naturally we hate to be reformed and plucked out of sin. To. 10. 21.

7 That we cannot but necessarily and yet willingly sin. 1. Cor. 12. 2.

8 That our best actions are beautiful sins. Esaias 64. 6.

And this knowledge serves:

1 To justify God in his judgments. Romans 3. 5. The benefit of this knowledge.


2 To confound the goodness of nature Romans 3. 19.

3 To magnify the riches of Gods mercy. Ephesians. 2. 3, 7.

4 To send us to Christ. Roman. 3. 22.

Concerning God, Sect. 4. Gods ordering sin.
we are thus to conceive of sin.

1 That he hates al evil as a righteous God. Psa. 5. and no unclean thing
shall dwell with him. Reuela. 21.

2 That he permits and orders evil in special wisdom to his glory.
Act. 5.

3 That he knows and searches the most inmost closet of sin. Ierem. 17. 10.

4 That he is able to punish and to take vengeance of the same. Isaiah 40.

5 That he punishes sin with sin, and yet most righteously. 2 Thessalonians. 2.
11.

6 That though he have laid the chastisement of our peace upon his Son: yet
he will correct us as his children for sin. Esaias 53. Psalm 88. 89.

And this knowledge serves,

1 To justify the perfect holiness of God. And the use.
Psalm. 18. 30. Psalm. 145. 17.

2 To magnify his wisdom in disposing of evil. Romans 11. 33.

3 To give him his prerogative, that he is (...), the searcher of the heart.
Ier. 17. 10.

4 To ascribe unto him the glory of his power and super excellent greatness,
that we might be humbled before him. Psalm. 86. 9, 10.

5 To work in us an hatred of evil, and love of righteousness. Genesis 17. 1.

6 To prevent presumption, and cause us to work out our salvation with fear
and trembling. 2. Cor. 5. 11. Phil. 2. 12.

Secondly, Our judgment being thus rectified, Sect. 5. How sin to be avoided.
we must proceed to the practice of avoiding evil.

And this is seen either in

1 Preventing sin, or 2 Recovering out of it by unfeigned repentance. And
first how prevented. 1. generally.

Sins is prevented either: 1 Generally or 2 Particularly.
Generally: by

1 A continual watchfulnes over our heart and outward man.

2 A fear and suspecting of our selves, as at all times, so when we have most
experience of Gods mercy. Pro. 28. 14. Job 1.

3 A continual resigning of our selves into the hands of God.

4 Walking as always in his presence. Genesis 5. 22. Genesis 17. 1.

5 To have a continual eye to Gods commaudements. Psalm. 119.

6 To meditate on Gods judgments, inflicted on his dearest children for sin.
2. Sam. 12. 11, 14.

7 Consider the inestimable love and mercy of God toward us. Exodus 34. 6.

Eighthly, Employing our selves in some honest calling. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 11, 12. and
that

1 In faith and without distrust of Gods providence, with a good conscience.
Mat. 6. 25. Heb. 13. 18

2 With cheerfulnes and contentment, without murmuring and covetousness. Heb.
13. 5.

3 Committing the success to God and waiting for his blessing, without making
have to be rich, or indenting with God for these outward things. 1. Tim. 6. Ge.
30. 1. Ha. 1. 16.

4 In humility, and lowlines, not sacrificing to our net, but giving God the
glory. Genesis 32. 10.

5 In holiness sanctifying the same by the word and prayer, and laying a good
foundation thereby toward heaven. 1. Tim. 6. 1. Tim. 4.

6 In faithfulness and diligence, redeeming the time, and accounting for it.
Ephesians. 5. 16.

Ninthly, learning to use our Christian liberty a right.

1 Herein not so much to stand (...) lawfulnes, as expedience. 1. Cor. 10.

2 That all things be done to edification, not offense. 1. Cor. 14.

3 That as we remit of our liberty in regard of such as are weak of ignorance,
so we use it in respect of the obstinately ignorant, lest we harden them in
their sin. Mat. 15. 14.

4 That we use the things of this life within the compass of our callings. 1.
Cor. 7. 1. Cor. 10.

5 For our recreation that it be in things indifferent. Phil. 4. 8.

2 Very spare and sober.

3 Tending to a spiritual end, not the satisfying of the flesh. Gal. 5. 13.

6 That all things be done to the glory of God. 1. Cor. 16.

Tenthly, By avoiding the occasions of sin, which are

1 Evil company. Ephesians. 5. 11.

2 Excess in the use of the creatures. Luc. 21. 34.

3 Giving the bridle to the outward man. Genesis 31. 1.

4 Opportunity and seasonablenes. Eccles. 3. 1.

5 Appearance and show of evil, etc. These. 5. 22.

And this sin generally may be prevented: particularly thus, when we are
assaulted by any tentation.

1 To mourn at the privy motions of sin, and at no hand to set light by it. 2
How in particular we may resist sin.


2 To know that I bear a traitor in my bosom, and therefore here at no hand
co^sult with flesh, nor give way to the temptation. James 1. 14.

3 To choke it by strong cries and groans to God. Mat. 6. 13.

4 To put it off by exercising the mind with contrary meditations and affecting
the contrary virtue. Psalm. 1.

5 Examine thy heart why it is thus, and thou shall find some cause of this
tentation. Psalm. 4.

6 The cause found either,

1 Want of sound repentance for some former sin,

2 Security,

3 Some greater evil like to follow, whereof this tentation is a messenger, or
such like negligence, dispose thy self accordingly.

5 Intend thy calling more carefully and conscionably. Ephesians. 5. 15.

6 Renew thy repentance and vows to God more effectually. Psalm 116.

7 Dispute not with Satan, neither play with the flame, but fly away with
Joseph, though thou leave thy coat behind thee. Jacob 4. 7. Genesis 39. 12.

8 Labor not so much to avoid the outward act, as to have thy heart purged
from the evil thought. Ps. 51. 2. 10.

9 Submit thy self rather to any punishment (if it so please God) then to
yield to the tentation. Matthew. 5. 29.

10 And look for one temptation in the neck of another.

11 Yet faint not in thy resistance: but persevere constantly, and by Gods
mercy satan shall fly away. Iam. 4. 7. Matthew 4.

If Satan prevail, Sect. 6. 3 How to recover our sinn^.
and thou art foiled, then thou must rise again by repentance. To this end
consider:

1 Thy estate in grace, which must be renewed by repentance. Psalm. 51.

2 Gods mercies, which are above all thy sins. Psalm. 103. 8. Exo. 34. 16.

3 Thy former experience how thou have recovered. Psalm. 77. 5.

And so pract^se thy raising up in this manner:

First, view thine iniquity in the glass of the law, to bruise thine heart, and
there thou shall find what an evil and bitter thing sin is. Ier. 2. 19.

Secondly, 1 By viewing sin and that, first in the law.
hereupon apply that knowledge unto thine own soul by the power of
conscience assisted by the blessed spirit of bondage: and proceed to judge thy
salfe, concluding that thou art guilty of eternal death. And hence will
follow compunction, and wounding of the heatt:

3 The heart being thus wounded that thou may be kept from despair, 2 In
the Gospel.
view thy self secondly, in the glass of the Gospel, that the bruised reed
may not be broken, by considering what a bitter and yet precious ransom was
paid for thy sin. Mat. 20. 28.

4 Hereupon make application unto thine heart by the work of conscience renewed
by the spirit of adoption, and raise up thy self with this assurance, that
though thou art a sinner, yet Christ is thine, and thou have pardon of thy
sin, and shall have life eternal in him. Mat. 11. 28. Mat. 5. 3. 4. Lu. 15.
2. Cor. 7^

This application works two contrary effects:

1 Thou shall rejoice that thy sins are forgiven thee in Christ Jesus.

2 Thou shall be sorrowful that thou have displeased so good and gracious a
father.

And this sorrow is expressed: 2 By judging.


First, by Judging thy sin before God in the court of thy conscience.

And this Judgment contains:

1 By examining thy sin, and taking a more particular notice thereof.

2 Confessing it, Psalm. 32. 5. and that

1 With grief and detestation.

2 Particularly, not generally, not only so far as thou know, confessing
herein thy knowledge to be short, and yielding up thy vnscearchable heart unto
God. Lord cleanse me from my secret sins. Psalm. 19.

3 Against thy self not excusing or diminishing: not laying the fault upon
God, the creatures, etc. but blaming especially that corrupt fountain of thy
heart herein. Psalm. 32. 5. Psalm. 51.

4 Unto God, not unto Angels or men, etc. who only is able and ready to
forgive. Psalm. 103.

Thirdly, Thou must condemn sin, and this is done:

1 By acknowledging what is due unto thee for it, namely shame and confusion of
face for ever. Ezra 9. 6.

2 Professing thine own vileness, and unworthiness of the least of Gods
mercies. Job 39. 16.

3 Justifying God in what he might do, and submitting thy self under his
mighty hand. Ely. 2. Sam. 2. David, 2. Sam. 15.

4 Execute vengeance upon thy self for thy sin, 2. Cor. 7. in as this manner:

First, lie down in thy confusion and cover thy face with shame. Ier. 3. Luke
18.

2 Abhor and detest thy self in sackcloth and ashes. Job 42. 6.

3 Have indignation and zeal against thy self for offending so good a God: 2.
Cor. 7. Peter wept bitterly. Psalm. 73. 22. so foolish, etc.

4 Groan under the burden of thy flesh, and desire to be rid of it Romans 7. 21.

5 Possess a broken heart for thy sin all thy life long. Psalm. 51. 17.

6 Refrain thy self from lawful comforts. Joel. 2.

7 Impose all means of mortifiing thy rebellious flesh, as fear of thy self,
lest thou fall again. Pro. 28. 14.

8 Mingle thy drink with thy tears, and in thy greatest security, let the
remembrance of thy sin, awake and rouse thee up. Psalm. 51.

9 Desire ever after more carefully to please God. 2. Cor. 7.

10 To this end preserve a record of thy sin and retain some monument
thereof with thee.

11 Consider often what punishments thou have felt for sin.

12 And let the day of thy death and appearing before the judgment seat of
Christ be always in thy mind, make thou sure account of it, and daily make
ready for it. 2. Pet. 3.

13 Cease not crying out against thy corruptions and complaining unto God of
thy rebellions, that he may strengthen thee against them. Psalm. 119. 49.

14 Bind thy self by the oath, and by the curse to forsake all sin, and to
continue constant in the service of thy God. Ezra, 10. 3. 2. Chro. 15.

15 Reprove sin boldly in others, and pluck them out of the fire: Jude 23.
though thou be scorcht for thy labor.

16 Suffer affliction as a good soldier of Jesus Christ, and prepare thy soul
unto tentations. 2. Tim. 2.

Thus shall thou cut off sin, and happily preserve thy self in a constant
course of godliness.

For thy better instruction herein.

1 Call to mind what before is delivered in the sixth part of the girdle of
truth concerning holy actions, which may help thee both in the true knowledge
of God to inform thy judgment, as also in the right and holy practice of good
things, which must be part of thy daily sacrifice.

CHAP. XI.
BEing thus instructed in generall^ avoid evil and do good, the next duty
that thou must perform, Thanksgiving.
is thankefulnes unto God. 1. These. 5. 18.

And this duty is necessary: because

1 We do approve our right in Gods blessings. 1. Tim. 4. Sect. 1. It use.


2 We make them profitable and durable. Mat. 14. 19, 20.

3 We increase them, and make them pledges of heaven.

4 We do ease our selves of much begging, and so approach to the life of glory.

5 We acknowledge God to be the giver, and blesser of them.

6 We do answer the end, why God bestowed them on us. Deu. 8.

7 And do by this duty perform a most principal part of worship and glory to
our God. Psalm. 50. 23.

8 Security and hardness of heart is hereby prevented.

9 Our faith in God is confirmed and increased.

10 Spiritual pride and hypocrisy is ouer-mastered.

11 The certainty of our saluauation hereby pledged and confirmed.

12 Our account made ready, and so we prepared to meet the Lord.

And it is to be performed daily:

1 Because we daily receive good at the hands of God. Lam. 3. 23.

2 And by this means shall prevent many evils which daily do assault us

And this duty is performed on this manner:

First, Sect. 2. How to be practiced.
The heart must be prepared:

1 With sound notice of the blessing, conceiving more excellently of God then
we possible can see him by his blessings.

2 True humility for the same, by serious meditation, both of the Majesty,
power and goodness of God and also of it own unworthiness.

3 As also it must be purged by ^ settled purpose of not offending s^ bountiful
a God.

4 And an holy persuasion, that we have received the benefit in the favor of
God.

5 And a^ holy desire to set forth the glory of God.

2 The mouth must speak of the mercies of God: And that,

1 Reverently and holily, no^ lightly or loosely.

2 Particularly, as near as we may recounting the same. Genes. 32. 10.

3 Publicly, even in the great congregations unto the Church (...) GOD, yea to
the generations to come. Ps. 66. and 102.

4 Privately between God and our own souls to avoid hypocrisy. Matt. 6.

5 Wisely and orderly for spiritual blessings, and then for temporal. Ephe.
1. 3.

6 Faithfully, as well for blessings promised and to come, as for those we have
received. 2. Chro. 6.

7 Constantly, as well when God takes, as when he gives. Job 1. 21.

8 Humbly, acknowledging our selves to be unworthy of the least of them.
Jacob, Gene. 32.

9 Speedily, if it be possible to prevent the Lord. Gene. 24.

10 Continually, even all our life long.

11 Charitably provoking others to the like duty.

12 Acknowledging Gods graces in others, and without envy or detraction
advancing the same.

13 Yea, wishing that all may be partakers of the same graces with us. Number. 11.

14 Impartially, as well for the least as for the greatest.

3 We must praise God in our life, and actions. Here observe these principal
actions of thankfulness. Psalm 1.

1 To renew our obedience, (...) increase our service of God. Psal^^ 116.

2 Continual mortification of (...) old man. Psalm. 106. 3. Ezr. 10.

3 Casting out the special (...) beloved sin. Mat. 5. 29.

4 Making much of the mean whereby Gods blessings are sanctfied, and so
continued unto us, nam^ly, the Preaching of the gospel, and Romans 10. 15.

5 Laboring heartily the conversion of others. Psalm. 51

6 Releeuing and forgiving, (...) praying one for another. Ephesians. 8.

7 Believing Gods promises, (...) waiting patiently the full acco^plishment of
them. Psalm 40. ^ Heb. 11.

8 Erecting monuments and tro^phes of Gods benefits to posteri^^ Genesis 22. 15.
etc.

9 Writing and registring the n^ble acts of the Lord. Psalm. 102.

10 Imposing fit names unto (...) children, in remembrance of God mercies. Genesis
41.

11 Paying our vows unto God and men. Psalm. 65. 1. Ion. 2. 9.

12 Being content with whatsoever God bestows upon us.

Thus are we to perform thankefulnes unto God.

Which that we may perform more happily:

First, Let us beware of these evils which are maine enemies to this duty: As,
Sect. 3. What evils to be avoided.


1 To imagine, that we deserve any thing Luc. 17. 10.

2 That we have any thing merely by our own labor and industry. Psalm. 127.

3 That we harp more upon our troubles, then Gods favors and benefits.

4 That we be always begging, but never recounting what we have received.

5 That we consider what others have, rather then what we have need of.

6 That we be not secure in the blessings of God, but rather fear our estate
most when we have most favors. Job 1.

7 That we tie God unto these outward things.

8 That we dote and rest upon these, and not rather forget them in regard of
the things of the life to come. Phil. 3.

9 That we conceive basely and meanly of Gods mercies, and do not see and
worship God in the least of them. Sect. 4. Helps to thankefulnes.


Secondly, Let us use these helps (...) thankefulnes. As

1 Rest we upon God as the giver of all good blessings.

2 Use we all holy means for the obtaining of them.

3 Leave we the success to Go: depending on his providence.

4 Think we not what God can give, but what is fit for us to receive.

5 Consider we how small a tribute the Lord requires for all his blessings.

6 What a prerogative we attain by thanksgiving, that God is the receiver, and
we giuers unto God, and how much better it is to give then to receive.

7 Let the creatures provoke us hereto, left otherwise they condemn us. Heb. 6.

8 Let our commodity persuade us, either if we will have, or use, or hold Gods
favors comfortably.

9 And lastly consider we the account to be made in the life to come, which is
made up by thankefulnes unto God in this life. Ioh. 3.

And thus far concerning thankefulnes

The chief use and benefit thereof, Sect. 5. The benefit thereof.
is to keep us in a constant course of obedience unto God, in the enjoying of
his blessings. And this is of the Next duty daily to be performed of us:

CHAP. XII.
NAmely to labor constancy and perseverance unto the end. Of constancy and
perseverance.


And that because:

First, Hereby we approve the soundnes of our calling and gifts, Sect. 1. It
is most necessary.
which otherwise if we fail were but temporary, given rather for others then
for our own good.

2 We obtain the promise and the crown that is set before us. He. 11. which
otherwise by falling away we shall lose. Revel. 3. 6.

3 We approve the truth of God, and give him the glory of his faithfulness. 1.
These. 5. 24.

4 We overcome satan and all our enemies. Ephesians. 6. 13.

Helps hereunto are:

First, The establishing of our faith, that the children of God shall continue
to the end: and that because,

1 Our God is faithful and almighty, and his gifts are without repentance who
has promised it. Romans 11.

2 Jesus Christ makes continual intercession for us. Luke 22^ 33.

3 The holy Ghost shall abide with us to the end of the world. John 16. to
preserve us. John 14.

4 We are the beloved of God: and therefore.

1 Whom he loves once he will love to the end. John. 13.

2 Whatsoever we ask in his name, the father will give us, if it be
agreeable to his will. 1. John 5. 14.

3 All things shall turn unto our good. Romans 8. 29.

4 We are married to him for ever in holiness and righteousness: Ose. 2.

5 Gods covenant with us, is everlasting. Jeremy 30. Ezechiel 11. Psalm. 89.
and Ose. 2.

6 We are united unto Christ our head, Collossians, 2. and given to him of the
Father, and therefore none shall take us out of his hands John 10. John 17. 17.

7 We have the word and sacraments, which shall continue with us to the worlds
end, to uphold us in our righteousness. Mat. 28.

8 We have strengthening grace to continue us in well-doing. Ephe. 3. 16.

9 Our slips, and fallings, are means to perseverance.

Here Consider.

1 That the child of God being regenerated, may, and does fall: and that
because:

1 God leaves him often to himself. Sect. 3. Removing the hindrances, here of
the falls of Gods children,
Ose. 5. Psalm. 30. and that,

1 To let him see his own strength to be humbled thereby. Hose. 14. 4.

2 To drive from that hold, to rely only upon God. Cantic. 3. 4. Luc. 22. 32.

3 To make him more compassionate and helpful to others in their infirmities.

2 Satan is continually sifting of him. Luke 22.

3 He caries about him a traitor ready to betray him hourly. 1. Pet. 2. 11.

4 His falls may well stand with his estate in grace, yea do much make for
the trial and increase thereof. 1. Pet. 1. 7.

As in his fall,

1 He discernes his imperfection, and so is provoked to take stronger hold.
Canti. 3. 4.

2 In his recovery he feels the undoubted grace of God. Psalm. 32.

3 In both he has experience of the combats between the flesh and the spirit,
al which are undoubted signs of regeneration. Luke 11. 21.

4 He is made more acquainted with the deceitfulnes of sin, and so more
skillful to prevent the same. Heb. 3. 13.

5 He is shamed by his fall, and driven from the hold of the world, and such
like baits of sin. Hose. 14. 4.

6 he is provoked more egerly to follow after the mark, by how much he has
been cast behind. 2. Cor. 11.

7 He becomes more fearful of himself, and will not be so venturous upon the
occasions of sin. Mat. 26. 75.

Consider therefore,

2 How far a regenerate man may fall:

First, In his faith, by doubting of Gods favor and the assurance of his
salvation. Psalm. 22. Psalm. 51. Psalm. 77.

Hence proceeds

1 Proud and foolish reasonings against God. Ier. 12. 1.

2 Vain and uncharitable speeches and wishes against our selves, Job. 3.

3 Distasting of the means and furtherances to salvation.

4 The graces of God may be lessened in them. Psalm. 51.

5 They may be covered.

6 Loss of some graces of God all his life long.

2 Erring through ignorance in some maine point of salvation, so the Apostles,
Acts 1. 6.

3 He may dwell in his ignorance for a time, and maintain the same, Gal. 2.
Peter.

Secondly, in his life. and that,

1 By falling into some gross sins. 2. Sam. 11. 2. Sam. 24.

2 To lie a sleep in them till he be roused up.

3 To fall into them again after repentance, and so may sin presumptuously.
Mat. 26.

Hence will follow:

1 That the light of Gods countenance shall be taken away. Ps^. 51.

2 The horrors of hell shall assault and buffet him, and so he may despair.
Psalm. 77. 11.

3 Some grievous outward afflictions shall follow him to the grave. David.

4 His life shall be a burden and irksome to him. Jacob. and he shall be
impatient under the cross. Job 3. 7.

5 He shall cause the name of God to be blasphemed by the wicked. 2. Sam. 12.

6 His first love shall be cooled, and zeal in godliness abated. Apo. 2. 4.

7 The weak shall be offended at him.

8 Gods Spirit shall be grieved. Ephesians 4.

9 He shall feel a weakness in him in regard of such sins as have got
strong hold often over him. Psalm. 6. Ier. 13. 23.

Thus far may a regenerate man ^all, And the difference between them and the
wicked.
and yet rema^ne in the state of grace, and differ from a reprobate, or
hypocrite, As thus:

1 The reprobates te^porary faith is the chief cause of his falling and
prophanes in life; but the elects error in life is the occasion of the decay
of his faith.

2 The hypocrite is usually senseles in his fall, and so continues 1^ Tim 4. 2
but the regenerate at length has the true sightofit. 2. Sam. 24. 10^

3 The hypocrite if he fret an^ grieve, it is for fear of punishment or loss
of the temporal blessing not for the loss of Gods favor etc. Psalm. 51. Genesis
27. But

4 They both fall into the sam^ sins again, but yet the hypocr^^ after
sins committed with more strength and security, the regenerate with more
resistance, fear grief, and in great weakness. Ps. 19^

5 They both are impatient, an^ speak foolishly against God, bu^ the hypocrite
speak as he thinks and wishes in the aduisednes and purpose of his heart:
the regenerate speaks in folly, rashness, not as he thinks or wishes, but as
his corruption ouerruling him does mislead and coming to himself, condemn
himself for it and cleares the Lord. Ps. 73. Job 42

6 They both decay and los^ their first love, but yet the hypocrite counts this
to be his wisdom, and the true measure of holiness, esteeming his former
zeal to be rashness, etc. whereas the regenerate acknowledges it was better
before then now, and mourning under his estate labors the recovery and in some
measure obtaines it. 2. Sam. 12. Mat. 26.

7 They both may refuse the means also, but yet the hypocrite in pride and
obstinacy, falls at length, from loose means to none, and so to a despising
and persecuting the same: the elect though he leave in his heart, yet he
returns with shame, and cleaues more conscionable to the means and is
profited thereby.

8 They both may be losers by their fall, and not recover all their life long:
but with these differences.

1 The reprobate loses all graces and becomes a very beast. Psalm. 49. without
knowledge, ciuility, etc. The regenerate recouers necessary graces, as faith
in some measure of use and feeling: but that full persuasion joy in the spirit,
etc. he happily recouers not again all his life long.

2 The reprobates loss is without feeling, causing him to set up his rest more
securely in this life, and so prepares him to sudden destruction: that of the
elect humbles him in all things, causes him to work out his salvation with
fear and trembling, to go down with sorrow to his grave, and to be weary of
the world, and to desire to be with Christ. Phil. 2. 12.

This may we discorne between the fall^ of Gods children and the wicked. And
this serves.

1 To try us in our decaies, and to comfort us in the same. Pro. 24. 16.

2 To justify Gods faithfulness who never forsakes his children. 1. Cor. 10. 13.

3 To stop the mouths of the wicked, who rejoice at our falls* Mich. 7. 8.

4 To assure us of constancy and perseverance to the end. 2. Tim. 4* 18.

CHAP. XIII.
A second help hereunto is,

FIrst, watchfulnes over our hear^s and ways that they may continually, Of
wathfulnes.
be acceptable unto God. And that because. 2. Tim. 4. 18.

1 Hereby we are prepared to tentations Luc. 21. 34. Mat. 13. 25. 1 The use of
it.


2 Enabled to undergo them. Ephesians. 6.

3 And to have a good issue out of them. Luc. 21. 36.

4 Without this our whole life, and best actions, are either rashness or
security. Pro. 28. 14.

5 By it we attain, certainty and resolution in well-doing. Ephe. 6. 13.

6 We prevent some evil which may make all other comforts unsavory, which we
are sure to look for in well doing. Mat. 26. 41.

7 Hereby the other graces of God in us are much beautified and increased.

8 And our infirmities much avoided or covered Psalm. 119. 9.

9 The best without it have bin deceived. Genes. 3. David, 2. Samuel 12.

10 Hypocrisy in weldoing and spiritual pride is prevented or mastered.

11 Dulnes and wearisomenesse also in good things is much helped.

12 And so we prepared happily to perfection.

Now this watchfulnes is performed

1 And especially by observing the heart and yoaking it. 2 How performed


2 In keeping under the outward man.

3 And this not for a spurt but all our life long, because so long endures the
combat.

4 And that observing and suspecting our greatest strength. 1. Cor. 10. 12.

5 Aiming and heeding principally the sins that we have most delighted in.
Psalm. 19. Psalm. 25.

6 Examining the best graces of God in us, lest some dead fly be in them. Pro.
28. 9. Mat. 6.

Helps hereunto are: 3 Helps hereto.


1 The glass of the Word. Psalm. 3 To have the fear of God continually before
our eyes.
119. Hebr. 11. 6.

2 Continual fear of our selves. Pro. 28. Phil. 2. 12.

3 To have the fear of God continually before our eyes. 1. Cor. 7. 1

4 Sobriety in our knowledge, and use of outward things. 1. Pet. 5. Romans 12. 3.

CHAP. XIIII. Of prayer.

FOurthly, Earnest and constant prayer unto God to uphold us by his mighty
power, in cheerefulnes provoking one another to holy duties. Psalm. 40. 4. 1 And
it conditions.


1 Publicly in the Congregations.

2 In private as well with our families, as in our closets, or such like secret
recourse. Mat. 6. Psalm. 4.

Conditions of prayer are:

1 That our prayer must be in faith without doubting. Iam. 1. 6.

2 In love, forgiving one another. Luc. 6. and praying one for another.

3 In wisdom, praying first for the favor of God when we would have any
blessing, and when we would have an evil removed, praying for the forgiunes of
sin, which is the cause of it, and dividing the times for prayer and our
callings. Dan. 6. 10.

4 In zeal and feruency from the heart and affection. 1. Cor. 14^ Iam. 5. 16.

5 In constancy and patience waiting the Lords good leisure. Psalm. 40. 1. Psa.
135. Psa. 147.

6 In humility, abasing and vilifying our selves before the Lord. Ge. 32.

7 With thanksgiving unto God for all his mercies. Psalm 103. 1.

8 Renewing our vows and promises unto God. Psalm. 116.

9 With strong cries and groans begging the pardon of our own sin, and the sin
of the Church and land wherein we live. Dan. 9.

10 Craving such necessaries for our selves and others, with a holy submitting
of our selves for the matter, manner, time, and measure to the will of God.
Mat. 26. 42.

Thus must our prayers be made unto the Lord* and by them we shall be,

First, Much strengthened in the grace of perseverance. Luke 22. 32. as also.

2 Kept in the vigor and power of our Christian life. Ephesians. 6. 2 The benefit
of prayer.


3 Experienced in our sweet fellowshippe with God. Romans 8. 15.

4 Our spiritual armor always fitted and exercised. Ephesians. 6.

5 Our daily wants supplied or recompensed. James 1. 5. 2. Corint. 12.

6 Tentations conquered; and happily diminished Mat. 4.

7 All our occasions well seasoned and turned to our good 1. Timo. 4.

8 Our whole life sanctified, and we prepared comfortably to a better. Phil. 1.
19.

CHAP. XV. Of peace with God, and lying down therewith^

AND thus being prepared, we are ready for sweet Peace with God either to
lay our selves down therewith in peace to our sweet repose, or to yield up our
lives with joy unto the hands of our redeemer. Psalm. 4. 8. Acts 7. 59. 1. Cor.
1. 7.

And this is the last duty daily to be performed of us: and this peace is
principally to be labored to us; Because,

1 We must respect not so much what we have done, 1 It necessity.
but how the Lord has accepted it. Romans 5. 1.

2 Hereby we shall with courage go forward, and be comforte^ in the
imperfection of our actio^ ^2. Cor. 8.

3 We shall obtain and maintain^ that unspeakable joy of the hol^ Ghost in our
hearts, Phil. 4. 4. and avoid the contrary sadness and distraction which
proceeds from want of this peace.

4 We shall refresh the graces of God in commending them thus with our selves
to the peace of God. 2 How obtained.


Now this duty is performed and blessing obtained:

1 By performing the daily duties in their former order and with constancy.

2 If by some urgent occasion or tentation we have bin interrupted, yet to
return to the^, and to redouble what we have omitted the next day

3 And this to be done not superficially with wearisomnes or of custom, but
determiately and for conscience sake.

4 Examine thy self, how thou could one hour well be without one of the
former graces, as without the comfort of the remission of thy sins, etc.

5 Judge and earnestly bewail thy self, if thou have either omitted or
slightly performed any of these.

6 Be sure so to perform these, as that thou do not neglect thy calling. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 12.

7 If thou have performed them in some poor measure, yet rest not in it, but
labor more earnestly with God for a further grace. Phil. 3. 13.

8 And yet be thankful unto God for these small grapes and fruits,
acknowledging that it is his great mercy, that thou can do any thing, and
giving him all the glory thereof. 1. Corinthians. 15. 10. And thus shall thou
be sure to obtain this peace of God.

And having obtained it, thou must lie down therewith, and carry it with thee
to thy bed.

1 Because thou know not whether thy bed shall be thy grave. 1. Pet. 1. 24.

2 Thy sleep hereby shall be much sweeter, and dreams more comfortable.
Psalm. 4. 8.

3 Thou shall avoid nocturnall pollutions and uncleannesses.

4 Thy reins shall teach thee in the night season, and the darkness shall be
as the noone day. Psa. 16. 7.

And this is performed:

1 By resigning up our selves into the hands of God. 3 How performed


2 Ascribing unto him the glory of all the good we have performed. Psalm. 115.
1. Esaias 26. 12.

3 Acknowledging our selves to be unprofitable servants, if God should enter
into judgment with us. Luke 17. 10.

4 Craving earnest pardon of our imperfections in Jesus Christ, and laying our
selves asleep in his bosom. 1. John 1. 9.

5 Comforting our selves (if sense of faith be not present) yet with former
experience and inward habit thereof. Psalm. 22. 10.

6 Yielding up our selves in a willingness to death, in full expectation of the
life to come. Phil. 1. 20, 23. And thus guiding our selves by these former
rules, we shall lie down in peace, and so shall we comfortably perform the
daily sacrifice.

And thus far concerning such necessary duties, as we are bound in some
measure daily to perform.

CHAP. XVI.
FOR our better encouragement and furtherance herein; How to profit in this
direction.
observe these rules:

1 That being convinced in conscience with the necessity of these duties, we
purpose and solemnly vow unto the Lord the attempting and prosecuting thereof.
Psalm. 119. 106. Psalm. 119. 7.

2 That God principally respects the purpose of the heart, and if there be a
willing mind, accepts according to what we have, and requires not what we have
not. 2. Cor. 8. 12.

3 That we give not ear to the flesh pleading novelty, impossibility, etc.
Gal. 1. 16.

4 That we try the Lord, who is wonderful in blessing the unfeigned endeavors
of his children. Hag. 2. Malachi. 3. 10.

5 Then let us make trial at first in one of these, and grow ready therein,
so shall we with more willingness and skilfullnes proceed in the rest. James 2.
10. James 3. 2.

6 Let us not fail to meet the Lord with vnsayned thankfulness, when we see
him coming effectually in the weak performance thereof. Psalm. 81.

7 And so condemn and provoke thy self, as before, and thou shall see (by
Gods mercy) a good crease.

Yea, thou shall not only be able to perform these duties with comfort, but
also thou shall be able to entertain each several occasions of the day, to
Gods glory, thy exceeding profit, and benefit of others.

CHAP. XVII.
AND this is the second part of this daily sacrifice: Of right employing the
occasions of the day.
Namely to consecrate our daily occasions, as a reasonable sacrifice unto God.

Here observe.

First, That though the occasions of the day are diverse, and so not more
necessary, and easily to be directed, yet some principal there are which do
usually occur. The well ordering whereof will easily inform us, in the holy
entertayning of the rest:

CHAP. XVIII.
And these Principal are:

FIrst, To arise with God, Of rising with God and awaking in his peace.
and as we laid our selves down in peace, 1 The necessity thereof.
so to awake with the comfort thereof. Psalm. 23. 6. Lam. 3. 23. The reason
whereof is: Because:

1 We maintain hereby conconstancie in well-doing.

2 We renew that soundness wherewith we lay down.

3 We prevent that no root of bitterness break out at the first.

4 We provide for our more settled courses all the day after, and so begin a new
to live the daily life of grace.

5 We make our hearts merry in the Lord.

6 We are made principally more apt to prayer, which is the next occasion to
be entertained of us.

This is performed:

1 By meditating, of the true life of God, 2 How performed.
and day of the rresurection. 1. Cor. 1.

2 By magnifying our sweet repose, and resting in the bosom of Gods
protection. Psalm 3. 5.

3 Taking occasion by the light that appears, to consider of the armor of
light; or by the outward darkness that compasses, to bless God for the
inward light and to mourn for the ignorance and blindness that is yet in us,
yea to resolve the casting away of the works of darkness. etc. Romans 13. 12.

4 Praising the mercy and patience of the Lord, that yet we live to praise
him, and are spared to make our election more sure* and thereto especially
meditating on the constancy of Gods love toward us. John 13. 1. Psalm 19. 2.
Psalm. 102. 27. Jeremy Lament. 3. 23.

And this is furthered if we perceive dulnes.

1 By striving even in the night when we awake, 3 How furthered.
to sigh for sin, and hunger after mercy. Psalm. 16. 7. Cant. 31.

2 By opening our hearts (if occasion serve) to our chambersellow, if such
fellowshippe be enjoyed, and so shaming of our selves Jacob 5.

3 By avoiding overmuch sleep, ^ea scanting and stinting our selves thereof,
and rowsing up our selves from drousines by checking our hearts and
complaining of them to our blessed God. Prove. 24. 32. 33.

4 Taking occasion by our dreams or nocturall infirmities, to magnify Gods
mercy, that it is not so as we dreamed; or to check our infidelity, in
relying superstiously upon dreams; or to condemn our security, and
prophanenes in neglecting them utterly. And if we have been assaulted, with
terrors and corruptions, yet either they have not prevailed, or shall not be
imputed unto us.

5 Calling to mind some place of the word for our better stirring up, as Romans
13. 11. 12. 13. 14. Ephesians. 5. 14. 1. These. 5. 4. 5. etc. And provoking our
selves by the examples of the saints, who have risen early to praise the Lord.
Psalm. 5. 34. etc.

And so rising with the Lord, we shall he fitted to entertain the next
special occasion of the day: Which is^ Prayer.

CHAP. XIX.
THE necessity and right use thereof you have before; Of Family and private
prayer.


Only here observe these points for direction herein: As

First, That howsoever this duty of prayer in famil^es be neglected, Sect. 1.
It necessity.
and not esteemed necessary, yet the not use thereof at all, argues
irreligion, and contempt of God. Psalm. 14. 4.

Secondly, Sect. 2. Often to be performed, and by whom.
That not once, but oftentimes in the day we must perform the same. Daniel 6.
10.

Thirdly, And that not only in private in our closets, etc. but publicly
with our families. Genes. 18. 19. Job 1. 5.

Fourthly, That the Master of the family is fittest to be the mouth of God*
for his people, as being therein their Priest and Prophet. Revel. 1. 6.

Fifthly, That to this end, set times are to be appointed and kept constantly,
unless by sickness or other more invincible occasions we be interrupted.

Sixthly, Sect. 3. The manner how.
That we keep our selves in an holy temper, and peace of mind by a constant
course in all occurrents, and so prepare our selves to prayer.

1 Fixing our hearts on God, and meditating of his power and Majesty, to work
reverence in us.

2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, to breed affiance.
Heb. 12. 2.

3 Considering and examning our wants, to breed humility and patience. Psalm.
39. Psalm. 4. 6.

4 Excluding worldly ^ares which may hinder deuction. Luke 8 Mat. 6.

5 Not fretting at the prospertity of the wicked. Psalm. 37. 1.

6 In patience, bearing the wrongs of enemies, and leaving revenge to God. Romans
12.

7 Doing al things as in Gods presence.

8 Avoiding evil for conscience sake.

9 Meditating still on the day of judgment, lest we be unfitted or interrupted
in prayer. 2. Pet. 3. 2. Cor. 5. 11.

7 Consider we the manifold blessings we have ^eceiued from God to provoke us
to thanksgiving, without which our prayers are ineffectuall. Ephesians. 6. etc.

8 Here it is requisite that we also quicken our hearts by reading, and
meditating twice, or oftener in the day on some part of the Scriptures, either

First, Taking the Scripture in order before us. Nehemiah 8. Acts 13. Or else

2 Upon extraordinary occasions, making choice of fit Scriptures.

9 Bewail we seriously our neglect of closet prayer, and condemn we our
selves for our liplabour and customarie devotions, our wearisomnesse in
well-doing, our contentment with little feelings.

10 Renew we our vows for more often and conscionable performance hereof.

11 Rest we especially upon the continual intercession of our blessed
Advocate, Jesus Christ, who continually makes intercession for us, and is now
both praying for us, and ready to present our prayers to the throne of grace,
and to cover all the infirmities and failings of them.

12 Stir we up the blessed Spirit (as before) which may help us with sighs
and groans vn^peakeable. Romans 8.

13 And be we well advised of the particular thing we desire, that it may be
fit for God to give us, and us to ask for our present occasion. Matthew. 6.
James 4. 2.

Being thus prepared, we must power out our prayers (as before.) Avoiding here
especially:

1 Constraint, and ceremoniousnesse.

2 Customarinesse, praying rather for the times sake, Sect. 4. What to be
avoided therein
then for Gods glory. Psalm. 119. 108.

3 Conceit of the well-doing hereof in regard of the thing done.

4 Pride and ostentation in the opinion of our well-doing. Matthew 6.

5 Lip-labor and idle repetition of words.

6 Confusion and disorder, praying for earthly things before hea^enly. Mat. 6.
33.

7 Carnalnesse, when we pray more for earth than heaven.

8 Hypocrisy, doing it to be seen of men. Mat. 6.

9 Uncharitableness, praying for re^enge, etc. of private wrongs. Eccle. ^0. 20.
Iam. 4. 7.

10 Wearisomnes and dullness. Gal. 6. Exodus 15.

11 Hastiness and rashness, as ^we would feign have done.

12 Presumption, begging such ^^ings as are not seasonable. Luke 54. or beseem
us not.

13 Impiety, praying for indulence in sin; or indenting with God, and
limiting him to our will, ^^helpe us at such a time, or in such manner. Act. 1.
Dan. 4.

14 Infidelity, when we pray without the assurance of the acceptance of our
persons, which is the case of all popish devotion. Iac. 1. 6.

Observing well:

1 That as well for the least blessing, Sect. 5. Directions for prayer.
as for the greatest we sue to God in prayer, and so be thankful unto him,
left otherwise we deny God the giver, and so hinder our receiving.

2 That we measure not the prayer by the outward success, because an evil
prayer may be heard in anger, Osee 13. and a good deferred in mercy: Yea a
good prayer, though in much weakness, may be granted in love, Matthew 6. to
keep us from despair; and yet a more strong and fervent prayer may be denied
in greater love, both to humble us that we put not confidence in the means,
and to encourage us to constancy therein, assuring our selves that the ^ssue
of our prayers shall be gracious.

3 That in the greatest feeling of Gods mercy, we pray against tentations.
Matthew. 16.

4 That we especially commend unto God the afflicted state of the Church, and
desire our welfare in the prosperity thereof. Psalm 122. 6. Psalm. 126.

5 That we redouble our sighs and prayers, not suffering any repulse. Psalm.
119. 164. Matt. 15. Genesis 32. Genesis 18, etc. Ephesians. 6.

6 That we highly efteeme of the thing we pray for. Matthew. 5. 6.

7 That we find as much comfort in abiding long at prayer, as at hearing the
word.

8 That we be as ready to praise God for his mercies received, as to sue for
the obtaining of them. Psalm. 116. Luke 17. 12, 18.

9 That we rebuke our selves in our prayers, and rely only upon Christ.

The benefit hereof is manifold: Sect. 6. The benefit thereof,


1 We renew our right in the day. 1. Tim. 4. 4.

2 We arm our selves against tentations. Ephesians. 6. 14. 15.

3 We are ready for any good that shall be offered us, as consolation of the
sick, conference. etc.

4 We are pressed to do al things in the sight of of God.

5 And so very much fitted and furthered to set upon our callings.

CHAP. XX.
ANd this is the next maine occurren^ that falls out in the day, Callings, and
following thereof.
even to follow our Callings.

And here observe.

First, that to walk in a set calling for the common good, is the ordinance of
God imposed on every Christian. Sect. 1. That it is Gods ordinance to walk in
a calling
2. These. 3. 12. Genesis 3. 19 Ephesians. 4. 28.

And that:

1 To communicate Gods providence in the government of the world.

2 To maintain a comely order in the administration thereof.

3 To employ such variety of gifts as God bestows on men aright.

4 To maintain humane societies in the bond of peace.

5 To avoid idleness, and curiosity.

6 To prevent errors and distraction in religion.

7 To fit us to the ends of Gods providence.

8 That God may be glorified in ordering such infinite variety of callings,
both for the common, and each private good, and that especially for the life to
come.

And this serves:

1 To teach us to try our callings by this, that they have their warrant from
the word of God, and that we be fitted thereto, and so to reject the contrary.

2 To sanctify our callings by bounding them in the Lord. Ephesians. 6. 1. because
they are preserved by the same means by which they were ordained.

Secondly learn we:

That howsoever callings be the ordinance of God, Sect. 2. Callings to be
expected by ordinary means.
yet in these days we are to expect them,

1 By the ministry of men and

2 Our own industry fitting us thereto.

3 Submitting our selves herein to the rule of the word.

And that because:

1 Extraordinary callings belonged to the infancy of the Church and times of
extremity, etc.

2 We have a sure word better then any such extraordinary revelation. Heb. 1.
2. Pet. 1.

3 The providence of God is subordinate to means.

5 God has ordained this labor to humble us, and withal to comfort us in the
right and use of his blessings. Eccles. 1.

And this serves:

1 To reprove presumption upon extraordinary callings in these days, and
corruption in the obtaining of them.

2 To teach us for outward callings to depend upon the means which God has
sanctified thereto, Namely;

1 The authority of the magistrate^

2 Our fitnes to the calling.

3 And it fitnes for us.

3 To condemn those that under pretense of Religion reject humane callings.

4 And also to reprove such who wander up and down, betaking themselves to no
calling.

5 To convince also those that think callings are only appointed to get
blessings, whereas indeed they both serve to get, and also to use aright those
that are cast upon us; wherein gentlemen are much faulty.

Thirdly, Observe we:

That though it be the ordinance of God to have a calling, Sect. 3. The right
use of our calling, specially to be stood upon.
yet it is not the having of a calling, but the right use thereof, whereby we
glorisie God, and further our selves to happiness. 1. Cor 9. 1. Cor. 7.

And this serves:

1 For the condemnation of those that when they are in a calling make no
conscience thereof, esteeming it rather a reward of former service, then a
place of further service.

2 For our instruction, that we measure the worth of our calling by the right
use thereof, and only in the same expect the blessings.

Now that we may use our callings aright, we must observe these rules:

First, Sect. 4. How to use our callings aright.
our judgments must be further informed concerning our callings, and that by
these directions.

1 That each one by profession, has a general calling to be a Christian, which
excludes not, but orders the civil calling. 1. Cor. 2. 20.

2 That the calling which God has placed us in, is fittest for us. Phil. 4.

And this serves:

1 Much for the maintenance of order, and the avoiding of confusion in church
and commonwealth.

2 To prevent idleness and distraction in our callings.

3 To secure us of good success therein.

Thirdly, Learn we,

That all our actions be warranted by our callings, as kept within the
compass thereof.

And that because:

1 Else they are not done in says, and so cannot please God. He. 11. 2.

3 They do exclude themselves out of the protection of the almighty. Psalm. 91.

And this serves:

1 To condemn al busy bodies and presumptuous usurpers of other men's
callings, upon what pretense soever. 2. Sam. 6. Ioh. 21. 21. 1. Pet. 4.

2 To discern of the integrity of our actions; because even a good action not
warranted by a calling, is sin.

3 To instruct us, that though we see no likel^hood of doing good, yet we must
not draw back so far as our calling requires. Ier. 1. 20. 19. Ezech. 2. 5.
Esaias. 6. etc.

4 To advise us how we may not buse Gods providence, and so expose our selves
to his justice.

5 To comfort us in the ill success of our endeauours, when we have done what
becomes us for the redress thereof, that our labor shall not be in vain.
1. Cor. 15. Esaias. 49. 3.

Fourthly learn we;

That together with the following of our earthly callings, we must join the
general calling of Christianity: because,

1 In serving of man we must serve God.

2 And in providing for this life, we must also store up for heaven. Luke 15*
and

3 These things will not prosper unless the better plough go to. Ag. 1.

And this serves:

1 To condemn those that profane their callings by neglecting the more
necessary.

2 To try our estate in grace.

3 To comfort us in our base callings, because God may as well be served in
these as in the greatest, and

4 To humble men in every calling, the mighty, who think their calling either
must not stoop to religion, or has no leisure there to: the poor, who think
their want to be a privilege from following their spiritual callings.

Fifthly, Observe we,

That whatsoever shall be sufficient for the right use of our callings, shall
be revealed unto us from the word, and thence to be warra^ted. Ac. 9.

And that because:

1 God is as well the ordainer of the means, as of the end.

2 And in his love he will have us certain what to do.

3 And hereby presumption and distraction are happily prevented.

And this serves:

1 To try the fitnes and blessing of our callings.

2 To humble us in rega^d of our ignorance and presumption.

3 To comfort us if through want or ignorance we may fail in some point, be
cause all is not revealed at once, and to assure us of good success therein.
Psalm. 73.

4 To provoke us to seek after knowledge as after treasures. Proverbs 2.

5 To teach us not to presume upon good meanings and intentions in our actions.
1. Sam. 13.

6 To condemn all rash and licentious actions whatsoever.

Sixthly, We must be resolved:

That our callings are imposed, not to merit by them, but to be humbled and
exercised in them, in thankefulnes unto God, for his love unto us in Jesus
Christ.

And that because,

1 Christ Jesus has sufficiently deserved for us, and so we shall derogate
from his sufficiency.

2 God does not require it at our hands. Esaias 1.

3 We are never able to perform it, but even when we have done all we can, we
are unprofitable servants. Luke 17. 10.

And this,

1 Condemns all Popish and voluntary service.

2 It encourages us in our callings, seeing God requires but what we can,
nay, what he gives.

3 It comfort us in our imperfections, and takes away that flauish fear of
hirelings and mercenaries.

4 It assures us of our salvation.

Seventhly, Learn we,

That though we fail in the best, yet notwithstanding we must not fail to do
our best in our callings.

And that,

1 By this faithfulness, we may witness that our callings are sanctified unto
us, in our obedience to God in them.

2 That they may be means of our enjoying of heaven. 1. Tim. 6. 19.

3 That we may be also possessers of greater glory in the heavens. Mat. 25.
26. etc.

And this serves:

1 To condemn al time-seruing, and customary in our callings. Ephesians. 6. 5, 6.

2 We are provoked to strive with the best for the best gain, and in these
things to seek after heaven.

And this is done:

By walking in our callings by faith and not by fear, that so both our persons
and actions may be approved.

And this is known:

1 Being warranted from the word, in what we do, or intend. 2. Pet. 1.

2 Our consciences convinced from the word to the same: and also

3 Witnessing with us in what we do. And that,

1 With cheerefulnes, not making have to be rich, but casting our care upon
God, and committing the success to him. 1. Pet. 5. Eccle. 9. 9.

2 With diligence, redeeming the time, and entertaining the means of Gods
providence, and not being wilfully guilty of the neglect thereof. Ephe. 3. 16.
17.

3 In wisdom, doing the most necessary duty and submitting always these
earthly callings to the furtherance of the heavenly, and expressing our
spiritual calling, even in the use of this, and so avoiding negligence that we
be not entangled with covetousness.

4 In love and meeknes, making others partakers of the benefit of our labors.

5 In patience, not tying God so much to the outward blessing of our labors, as
conte^ting our selves with the testimony of our good conscience therein. Heb.
13. 18.

6 With conscience, doing that which may be most profitable to Church and
Co^mon-weale: whereby are condemned all vain, and new fangled inventions, as
rather maintaining sin, then breeding any good to the Commonwealth. Zeph. 1.
Esaias 3. 19. 20.

7 In holiness, sanctifying the^ daily by the word and prayer. 1. Tim. 4. 5.

8 With constancy, loboring against ambition, envy, and impatiency, and
assuring our selves that our meanest endeavors shall be accepted in Jesus Christ.

9 To the glory of God, aiming at it in all things, and preferring it above all
1. Cor. 10. 31.

Admit^ing here these considerations: Sect. 5. How to leave callings.


1 That we are not bound to our callings any longer then means and maintenance
is supplied, but that in this respect we may leave or change our callings; yea,
for the public good also the caling may be changed

2 That we may intermit our calings. Sect. 6. How to intermit them.


And that,

1 For Religions sake, as to hear the word, etc. unless some bond of
covenant, or necessary present occasion come between.

2 We may also intermit our callings to serve the public good, or to minister
to the present and urgent necessity of our neighbor, our present case allowing
it.

3 Recreation also requires a vacancie from our callings. So that

1 Our recreation be in things lawful.

2 That it be moderate.

3 And that upon the days of labor.

4 That it further not only the particular, but the general calling.

Fourthly, Necessity also may impose a surceasing of our calling.

As when:

1 By sickness we are detayned, or some such invincible casualtie.

Thirdly, we must resign up our callings.

And that:

1 When God calls by death.

2 When other means warranted by the conscience, guided by the word do,
require and: that,

3 With testimony of a good conscience. 1. Sam. 12. 3.

4 By giving up our account for them unto the great judge. Heb. 13.

Thus are we to perform our callings.

The benefit whereof is exceeding great. Sect. 7. Benefit of callings.
For:

1 Hereby we shall be sure to be fed. Psalm. 37.

2 We shall be better fitted to our general callings.

3 We shall lay up a good foundation for heaven. 1. Tim. 6. 19.

4 We shall exercise herein many spiritual graces. 1. Cor. 7. as patience,
faithfulness, etc.

5 Hereby we shall perceive Gods power, and holiness, even in these base and
mean things, and be provoked to seek him in greater blessings. Mat. 6.

6 We shall be humbled, and so provoked to hunger after our dissolution.

And thus far concerning our behavior in our callings.

CHAP. XXII.
THe next maine incident to the day, Of the right use of the creatures.
is the use of the creatures.

And these are of two sorts.

1 Such as serve for the necessary preservation of life, as food, apparel.

2 Such as serve especially for the better being of the soul, as company.

Concerning food and sustenance, observe these rules.

1 That every creature is good, and that there is no more holiness in the one,
the^ in the other. 1. Tim. 4. 5. (...), though each Christian has a right to
all the creatures, yet is he to be restrained in the use of them.

And that by these limits:

1 The bond of Religion, which enioynes some times an entire abstinence from
the creature, that so we might be better fitted to spiritual duties. 1. Tim.
5. 23. 1. Pe. 5. 8. Ion. 3.

2 The bond of Christian policy may restrain us the use of some creatures on
some days, for the benefit of the Commonwealth, to which we ought to obey for
conscience sake. Romans 13. 5.

3 The bond of nature restraines us that we may not eat but for necessity.
Eccles. 10. 16. Mat. 12. 1.

4 The bond of conscience and equity also enioynes us, that we may not lawfully
eat, unless we have labored for it. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 12.

5 The bond of our callings binds us so to eat, as our Chr^stian calling^ may
be furthered and out Civil callings will maintain. 1. Tim. 5. 8.

6 The bond of Charity will^s us not to eat our morsels alone, but to provide
and reserve somewhat for the poor. Job 29. 31. Psalm 16. Neh. 8.

7 The bond of Sobriety restraines ^s from faring deliciously every day, and
from far-fetcht dainties, but to use our liberty as if we used it not, avoiding
unnecessary prouocations of gluttony. Esaias 5. 9. 10. Luke 16. 1. Cor. 7. 23.

8 The bond of contentment, which wishes the servant not to envy at the more
liberal fare of his Master, but each to be content with the portion that is
fit for him. 1. Tim. 6. 6, 8.

Thirdly, we are to renew our right in the creature by daily sanctifying them
unto us by the word and prayer. 1. Tim. 5. 1. Sam. 9. 13.

And that:

1 By acknowledging our selves unworthy of them. Genesis 32. 10.

2 Giving God the glory of them with thanksgiving. Mat. 26.

3 Seasoning them with holy and religious thoughts, and cheerful yet
profitable conference. Judge. 14. Luke 14.

4 Offering the strength of them unto God in our callings. Sect. 2. The benefit
thereof.
1. Kings 19. 8.

The benefit hereof is:

1 We shall avoid superstition, and that damnable doctrine of devils. 1. Tim.
4. 2.

2 We shall be better enabled to spiritual duties. Matt. 26. 30.

3 we shall use our Christian liberty aright. Romans 14.

4 We shall further nature to grace.

5 We shall eat of our own, and so be blessed. Psalm. 128. 1.

6 We shall provide safely for the time of famine, and eat to live. Psa. 33.
19. Psalm. 37.

7 We shall make us friends of this Mammon of iniquity, and ease our selves
well of an heavy burden. Euke 16.

8 We shall be ready to die, and prepared to the meat that shall endure for
ever. John 6. 27.

And thus much concerning our food. Of company, and
The like may we conceive concerning our apparel.

CHAP. XXII.
AS touching company, Of company and
we are to observe these points:

First, The kinds of company, which are, Good or Bad.

Here learn,

First, To discern good and evil company.

As thus:

First, Those are to be esteemed good, Sect. 1. How to discern good and bad
company.
which

1 Are of the same profession with us. Ephesians. 5. 11. Psalm 15. 4.

2 Who labor to holiness and sincerity of life. Ephesians. 5.

3 Who suffer with us for the same profession.

4 Who love the Saints, and long of the appearance of Christ Jesus 1. Cor. 1.
2 Thessalonians. 3. 14.

Secondly, Those are to be accounted evil:

1 Who speak evil of the power of profession Iud. 2. Pet. 2.

2 That refuse to participate in the means of holiness.

3 That disgrace profession with a profane life. Ephe. 5. 6.

4 That hate to be reproved, and continue obstinate in their sin. John, 2.
Epist.

5 That betray and persecute the saints of God. Mat. 10.

Secondly, Sect. 2. What company to be chosen, and how to be refused.
learn

Principally to make choice of good company. Psalm. 15.

Thirdly, observe we,

That we are not to refuse the worst company upon these conditions:

1 If thy calling require and allow thee, for their good, especially being
sought unto. Matthew 3. 5. Luke 14. 1.

2 If upon occasion thou fall upon them, or they into thy company. 1. Reg. 18.
Act. 17. 17.

3 If they be in any extremity thou art to seek to them. Luke 10. 33.

4 So thou do not return to them, Sect. 3. How to behave our selves in good
company.
but reclaim them to thee. Ier. 15. 19.

Fourthly, learn how to behave thy self in company.

Concerning good company there are these rules:

1 Christian Salutation and greeting each other in the Lord. Ruth. 2.

2 To be large hearted, and offer the most precious pearls unto them. Math. 13.

3 To use among them more cherefulnesse and familiarity.

4 To exhort one another to constancy. Heb. 3. 14.

5 To reprove each other for known or suspected infirmities. Leuit. 19. 17.
Gal. 2. 11. 13.

6 Taking occasion by some present blessing or judgment, to provoke to
repentance, or thankfulness. Genesis 33. 11. Genesis 49. 9. 15.

7 Joining together in prayer, at lest once before breaking up. Ephesians 6.

8 Aduising each other for outward occasions, but sparingly. Phil. Epist. 2.
Tim. 4. 13. 23.

9 Commending each other to their private remembrances. Ephesians. 6. 19. Act. 20.
32.

10 In their conference to keep an holy order, that the grauest, and most
experienced may both begin and moderate, without interruption or prejudice of
any ones gifts. 1. Cor. 14. Job. 32. 4.

The end and use of good company is:

1 To draw understanding out of them by conference. Sect. 4. The benefit of
good company.
Luke 24. Ioh. 4.

2 To receive comfort in our inward and outward troubles. Ruth 2. 13.

3 To be merry and cheerful in the Lord. Psalm. 32. 11.

4 To maintain love and Christian unity. Psalm. 133. 1.

5 To nourish our hope and union in the fellowshippe whcih is above. Col. 1. 5.

Now good company is either: Sect. 5. Difference of good company.


Set and appointed; or occasional.

Set company is to either spiritual or civil ends.

That which is to spiritual ends is either,

1 Public.

2 Private.

The set public meetings of the Saints are of two sorts:

1 Principal and necessary.

2 Accessory and occasional. Sect. 6. Of Sabbath society.


The Principal meetings are such which do immediately concern and are so
employed in the worship of God.

And these are:

First, The weekly meetings on the Sabbath.

And herein observe these rules: And it rules.


First, That we prepare each other thereto, by

1 Counsel, and

2 Encouragement.

3 Examining our wants, and

4 Laboring to be found in Christ. Eccles. 4. Phil. 3.

5 With prayer for the ministry of the word. Col. 4.

6 Instructing our families. 2. Thesse. 3. and

7 Condemning our former abuse of the Sabbath.

8 Renewing our vows for more conscionable obedience for the time to come; and
lastly, meditating on the eternal Sabbath.

Secondly, That we come together to the assemblies, and not stragle but that we
may be partakers of the whole worship of GOD. Acts 13. 44.

Thirdly, that we use all holy and reverend gesture to further attention to
the holy things, as to stand up, to look upon the preacher, etc. Luke 4. 20.
Number. 23. 18.

4 That we fail not privately to stire up one another (as we perceive
dulnes) to watchfulnes and heed-taking, by iogging, etc.

5 That we join with the congregation in such parts of Gods worship as then
are presently performing 1. Cor. 14. Act. 20. 36.

6 That we continue out the performance thereof, waiting for the blessing,
unless more urgent occasion call away. Matthew 24. 20.

7 That we confere with our families and neighbors some few together, of such
lessons as we have publicly heard, desiring to be satisfied by our minister
of doubtful points. Act. 17.

8 That we count this our only recreation for this day to build up the soul
in knowledge and holiness. Esaias. 58. 13.

Hitherto serve the private exercises. As

1 Sanctifying our selves daily in the family, by prayer and instruction of
our people. Genesis 18. 19. Act. 10.

2 Examination of our selves, and people concerning the public ministry and
trial of our profiting thereby.

3 Our soliloquies and secret conferences with God; and these are either set,
or sudden, upon the extraordinary occasion.

The use hereef is:

1 That without these we must not look for any benefit in the public.

2 By these we shall be enabled thereto, and assured of a blessing therein.

A Second public meeting for Gods worship, Sect. 7. Public thankesgiuings
and their rules.
are the solemnities of thanksgiving for extraordinary blessings received.
Exodus 15. Hest. 9. Est. 8. etc.

And these are to be performed:

1 By the lawful authority of the Christian Magistrate.

2 They are to be kept as Sabboths, with,

1 Like preparation.

2 Cessation from work.

3 Contribution to the poor, and

4 Spiritual exercise of the word and prayer. 1. Cor. 16. 2. Hest. 9.

5 Only here may be a more liberal use of Gods creatures, in regard of
inuitation of the poor, and enlarging of Christian liberty upon the occasion.
1. Samu. 9. 23, 24. Genesis 21. 8.

6 These are so be kept, that we be fitted and prepared thereby, to other the
like duties of thanksgiving upon private occasions, not that the performance
hereof should make amends, and cut off these. Luke 16. Esth. 1.

7 That herein we avoid:

1 Customarines. 2. Pet. 2. 13.

2 Opinion of merit.

3 Superstition. Iud 12. and

4 Will Worship Col. 2. 16, 21.

A third public spiritual meeting, Sect. 8. Public fasts.
is that holy exercise of Fasting and Prayer. Luke 5. 33. Acts. 1.

And here observe:

1 The Author, 1 The Author.
which must be the Christian Magistrate. Jonah 3. 7.

2 The occasion, 2 Occasion.
which is manifold, As

1 The ouerflowing of sin, threatening some grievous judgment.

2 Some judgment threatened, either by the word, or by some visible sign. 2.
Chron. 20. Ion. 3. Joel 2. Est. 4.

3 Some chastisement that is upon the land.

4 When any special good is to be done for Church or commonweal. Exodus 19.
Act. 13. 3.

5 When we fear the remoueall of some great blessings, as the word, etc.

6 When we see the like occasions in our neighbors, we are also for their
cause to be humbled. Psalm. 35.

Thirdly, Consider we the manner how the duty of fasting is to be performed.

And that, 3 Manner of performance.


1 For the Solemnity of it must be kept as a Sabbath. Esaias. 58. Zach. 7.

2 Here must be an abstinence, for the time from all meats, and all lawful
comforts, as thereby acknowledging our selves unworthy of life, unless we shall
hereby be unfitted to prayer. Joel 2. 13. 14.

3 We must also come before the Lord as beggars, in our meanest attire, as a
sign of our humility: Ioh. 3. Est. 4.

4 Here must be a more solemn and particular confession of sin, both in
general and particular, with more strong cries and groans to obtain pardon
for the same, as also a more public profession of our faith, and apprehension
of Gods favor in Jesus Christ. Dan. 9. 6. 7. and Io^l. 2.

Fourthly, 4 Time.
consider we the time of a fast, which is at the least a day, sometimes two or
three, as the occasion is more urgent. Hester 4. Ion. 3.

Fifthly learn we the true use and end of fasting. 5. Ends.
Which is:

1 Not to place religion in the bodily abstinence, but to use it as a means to
further religion. Joel 2. 13. Matt. 6.

2 Gods heavy wrath has hereby been appeased, and judgments kept out, and
removed, yea turned into blessings, Judges 20. Jonas 3.

And thus far of the public use of spiritual sociei^e. Sect. 9. Of private
spiritual society.


The private follows, which is seen:

1 In the private exercise of religion in our families, as Prayer,
Chatechising, reading of the word, Meditation.

1 In private fasts and thankesgiuings for family and personal occasions.

Wherein observe:

1 That they are to be performed by the authority of the master of the family.

2 That they are to be kept as Sabbaths.

3 That what is allowable in the public may here be faulty, namely show and
ostentation of that openly which we do in private. Matthew. 6.

Thirdly, Spiritual society is seen in holy conferences, and that

First, Between the Minister and his flock.

Here observe:

1 To avoid curious and high speculations. 1 How to be performed between
Minister and people.


2 To reason of such things as concern each others state.

3 And that not so much for desire of knowledge as for conscience sake.

4 And that with all readiness, and lowlines of mind.

5 And to resolve our selves and others.

6 That God may be glorified.

Secondly, 2 How between inferiors and superiors.
These conferences are between inferior and superior.

Here observe,

1 That the elder have the former place of speech.

2 That he despise not the advice and opinion of the inferior. Job 31.

3 That each be submitted to other in the Lord, the stronger submitting
himself to the capacity of the weak; and the weaker yielding to the reason of
the stronger.

Thirdly, 3 How between equals.
This conference may fall out between equals.

Here learn,

1 That some priority for order sake is to be used, and that to be given in
respect of the best gifts.

2 Contention must be avoided by wise bearing with each other.

3 And also order kept in attending each others speech. And

4 Wisdom to prevent idle talk, and labor the resolution of each necessary
doubt.

In all these Conferences generally observe these rules:

1 That we confer of our own principally, 4 Rules general for all.
and not of others estates.

2 That we avoid as much as may be worldlines, etc.

3 That we confer of spiritual things seasonably, and within compass.

4 That though it be lawful to speak of things indifferent, yet we make
choice to speak of what directly concerns holiness.

5 That we meddle not with State, or secret Domestical occasions.

6 That we intend Gods glory and each others profit.

7 That we be swift to hear and slow to speak. Iam. 5.

The trial of holy conference is this: 5 Trial of right use.


1 That if our desire of profiting others grow cold through carnal joy, then
we are to suspect that joy. Ioh. 4. Act. 20.

2 That either both depart better hereby, or else we at the Jest have the
testimony of a good conscience herein, and give not over the hope of good
success.

3 That we so part from company, that we be fit to be alone. Mat. 14. 23.

And thus far of the spiritual use of society concerning principally the
worship of God. Sect. 10. Of Accessory meetings for Religion.


The Accessorie meetings concerning Religion follow:

Such as tend to the furtherance thereof.

And that,

1 In the establishing of the truth.

2 Conuincing of error.

And these are either,

More general: As Councels.


1 Such as are the general Councels and Synods, appointed and gathered by the
Christian Magistate, for the maintenance of true Religion, and the rooting out
of heresies.

Here observe these rules:

1 That the Christian Magistrate is the chief moderator.

2 The word of God must be the rule and judge.

3 The end must be to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.
Ephe. 4.

Secondly, Synods, etc.
Some are less general, as the national and provincial Synods of particular
Churches, to be ordered in the same manner as before.

Hitherto appertain;

1 The schools of the Prophets, And their appertenances.
as being the nurseries of Religion, and seminaries of the Church and
commonweal.

Ie. 1. 1. Amo. 7. 14. Act. 6. 9. 2. Reg. 2. 15.

2 Religious feasts tending to nourish the fellowship of the Saints. Iud.

3 Contributions and collections for the poor.

Thus far of the Spiritual use of society.

The civil follows, Sect. 11. Of civil society.
and it is manifold.

1 State assembles to determine for the good of the body politic.

2 Corporations and Brother-hoods of Cities and Towns concerning the right use
of Trades and Mysteries.

Thirdly, Contracts or bargains, which must be with these conditions:

1 That we use no deceit either in word or deed, to entrappe or ouer-rate.

2 That our agreements be plain without cunning, and voluntary without
catching.

3 That promise be kept unless with consent on either side.

4 Mercy must be showed, if we have our brother at an advantage.

Fourthly, Civil society may fall out in Suits and Controversies.

Here observe,

1 That these hinder not our spiritual society in the worship of God. And
rules for the same.


2 Neither impeach other ordinary kindnesses, which ought to pass between
neighbors.

3 But rather we should suffer wrong then fall to these suits. 1. Cor. 6.

4 And seek we after al means of private agreement.

5 That we delay not suits to weary out our brother.

6 Much less by bribery seek to overthrow a good cause.

7 But to overcome evil with good, seeking peace and ensuing it.

A fourth use of society is for recreation.

Here observe:

1 That we be as careful to use our recreation a right, as to have liberty in
it.

2 That we make choice of a fit time, when we have need, by reason of
wearisomnesse in our callings.

3 Look we up still to God for continency in the use of our liberty.

4 Our kinds of recreation must be honest and of good report. Ph. 4. 8.

5 We must use great moderation of our affection therein.

6 We must be content to leave off when by hope of gain or company we see the
abuse creeping on. 1. These. 5. 22.

7 Our company must be suitable, such as we may order; nay, such as may moderate
us.

8 We must not be ouer-tired with our pleasures, but made more fit both for
our earthly and spiritual callings.

A fifth use of society, is in love feasts, usual for public meetings, and
not unfit among neighbors to maintain peace and amity.

But here we must keep these bounds:

1 That these feasts be not frequented on the Sabbath day. Neh. 13. 15. 16.

2 In them not the private but the public good must be intended.

3 Religion must be the square and moderator of them all, And

4 The end must be Gods glory. 1. Cor. 10. 31.

And thus far concerning set assemblies. There follows occasional: Such as
are by accident. Sect. 12. Of occasional meetings.
Here observe:

1 That our principal desire and scope be to sort with the better. Ps. 16. 3.

2 That we make not choice willingly of evil company. Prouer. 22. 23, 24.

3 That if by occasion, as at meat, Sect. 13. How to sort with the wicked.
at set meetings, or by fellowship in office, etc. we are linked with them, or
be bound in conscience to visit them, or meet with them in our iournies, etc.

Here we must avoid;

Hardening them in their sin, by light familiarity, vain applauding, or
winking at them, but rather we are to reprove, if not by word, yet by
behavior. Luke 14. 7.

2 We must not deiect them by our disdaineful or imperious behavior. 2. The.
3. 15. 1. Tim. 2. 25, 29.

3 Neither enrage them by unseasonable and over bitter reproves, unless Gods
glory presently lie in the balance. Matthew. 7. 6.

But that we may benefit them, we are:

1 To converse gravely, and yet humbly with them. Nehemiah 2* 1. 2.

2 To wait some good occasion from their speech, and so to work upon it. Acts
26.

3 To call to mind some present blessing or judgment, that so we may put by
idle talk. Amos 6. 6. Esaias 5. 12.

4 Commend we what is likely spoken of them, yet with an holy drawing them on
to better by grave exhortations. 2. Tim. 2. 24, 25.

5 In all our speech let it appear that love is the ground, and the souls
good the principal end. Matthew 5. 44.

6 Contrary we them not in their weakness always, but expound it to the
best, unless we see apparent contempt and desperate scorning* Iud 22. 23. Romans
14. 1.

7 If we cannot benefit by conference, then let us take heed we do not
communicate with them in evil, but rather break off wisely as Sampson did, by
some ridle or such like, and as near as may be, leave we the^ with peace,
thatso afterward there may be hope to win them. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 15. Romans 12. 18.

The use of evil company is:

1 That we make the more of the better sort, Use of evil company.
and labor to make the bad better. Ier. 15. 19.

2 That we long after heaven, where we shall find none but good company.
Philippians 1. Heb. 12.

3 That we grow more private and learn to be a part with our God. Genesis 5 22.

CHAP. XXIII.
AND this is the next occasion of the day, Of solitarines.
wisely to be entertained of us. Namely, to order wisely our solitarines, and
that because,

First, Now we are naked, and lie open to tentations.

Secondly, And may with best advantage and lest hinderance pursue the best
things, and so are capable of the greatest good, or subject to the greatest
evil.

Here therefore observe these rules:

1 That though we be from the company of men, Sect. 1. How to behave our selves
therein.
yet we have the presence and fellowship of the Almighty, and the ministry of
his holy Angels, and therefore that now especially we rejoice in this
fellowship. Psalm. 16. Psalm. 139.

2 Yet so as that we neglect not our callings, but be sure that we be kept from
idleness. 2 Thessalonians. 3.

3 That we especially call to mind those ill neighbors which we shall never
be rid of so long as we live, namely, our sins, and in our greatest freedom
of solitatines forget not our bondage under this tyrranny. Heb. 12. 1.

4 That we take heed of idle and curious speculations, feeding thereby our
melancholy or vain thoughts.

5 That we be careful to order and repress the infinite wanderings of the
mind, which at such times is most busy and exorbitant. Genesis 6. 5. Dan. 4. 2.

6 Especially that we be wise to discern satan's deepenes, who now will usually
most eagerly assault us, either taking advantage of our security, because we
are freed from outward occasions, or working upon priuatenes and want of
succor. Mat. 4.

7 That especially we meditate on heavenly things, comforting our selves with
the holy protection of Angels, who attend us, and rejoicing in the hope of that
blessed fellowship which expects us in heaven. Genesis 5. Genesis 24. 63.

8 At no hand give we place to Satan, seeking now to scare or distract us, but
resist we strongly by faithful prayer. 1. Pe. 5. 8. 9. 2. Chapter 3. 1

9 Presume not of such solitarines either which has no warrant, as that of
Monks, etc. or when thou art bound to society, for herein thou excludest thy
self the protection of the Lord. Eccles. 4. 9, 10.

Thus behauing our selves alone,

1 We shall never want the comfort of sweet communion. Mat. 28. Apoca. 3. 20.
John 14. 23.

2 Ready shall we be for such troubles when we may be driven to be alone.
Apoca. 1. 9. 10.

3 Fitter also for the fellowship and communion of the saints. 1. Tim. 3. 4. 5.

4 Strenghtned against satan, who now will principally assault us. Mat. 4.
Eccles. 4. 10.

5 And profitable redeemers of the time, and purchasers of eternity. Ephesians. 5.
16.

Provided:

1 That we vex not our selves with ^i^ting or envying others business and
states, Sect. 3. Cautions to be observed.
lest hereby we be made unfit for our own. 1. Tim 5. 13.

2 That we ouerwhelme not our selves with overmuch thinking of worldly things,
especially of the times to come, or things which may happen, lest the heart be
drowned with the love of the creature or appalled with fear of after-clapps.
Mat. 6. 34. Luke 21. 34.

3 In^ meditation of heavenly things, look we that our custom herein cause
not a vilifying or loathing of such heavenly mysteries. Mat. 6. 7. Mat. 15. 9.

4 Take we heed of an ouerweening conceit of our selves, if thou find a
greater furniture of Gods graces. John 5. 35.

5 Especially be careful that while thou meditatest of forsaking sin, thou
be not entangled with some spice thereof, either presuming further then thy
present strength, or by conceit of what thou do, or by the deceitfulnes of
Satan abusing thee with a contrary color of sin, while thoulabourest to
prevent him in another.

6 And then in laboring to re^ist sin, see thou be well armed and know thy
strength too: yet fearful of thy self, and so humbly cast upon God, that so
thou may resist in the evil day. Ephesians. 6. Prouer. 28. 14. Psalm. 16. 8.

And thus much concerning solitarines.

CHAP. XXIIII.
THE next employment of the day (...) how to behave thy self in enjoying of
good things, Of prosperity, and the right use thereof.
and in the right use of prosperity: and the knowledge hereof is needful.

First, Sect. 1. Necessary to be known.
Because the best have been tripped in this estate, as Solomon, Jonas, etc.

For first hereby religious exercises have been coldly performed and
intermitted. Mat. 22. 5.

2 Liberty has been given to looseness, and inward gifts grown cold. Hab.
1. 16. Amos 6. 5.

3 Evils that were banished, Danger of prosperity in the best.
have been recalled again, as gaming, etc. 1. Cor. 10. 7.

4 They weaken our trust and confidence in God. Hab. 1. 16.

5 Withdraw our love and kindness toward inferiors, with whom heretofore we
have been inward.

6 Breed policy, and so decei^ even in many professors. Genes. 20. 11. And

7 Cause covetousness and love of this life. Psalm. 62. 10. Luc. 12. 19. Amos 6.
3.

8 Yea, breed an unwillingness to bear the cross, and cunning to avoid it.
Mat. 26.

9 Give occasion to the world to think we are hers, and so causing her to
presu^e of us, makes her hereby, being deceived, when it comes to the proof,
our more heavy enemy. Genesis 31.

10 Hereupon also it comes to pass that the burden lies heavier upon the
afflicted, even because of our prosperity, being not carried wisely, and
tenderly. Amos 6. 5. Esaias. 5.

11 Yea, it is the occasion that causes us many times to censure those that are
afflicted, and to challenge their sincerity because of their afflictions. Job
8. Job 4. etc.

12 And not only so, but it causes jealousy among professors, and so
distrust of each other, when all bear not the same burden. Romans 15. 1.
Romans 12. 13. 16.

2 This estate is very slippery, and therefore we had need to get sure
footing that we may stand upright therein. Psalm. 73.

3 It is most uncertain and changable and therefore it stands us upon to make
us friends thereof while we have it. Luke 16.

4 The fear of the loss hereof does much distract which the right use thereof
will much abate and qualify. Psalm. 112. 7.

It being therefore apparent that the best may and do abuse prosperity observe
now how we may use it a right:

First, then let us consider the ends, why the Lord bestows these outward
blessings in this life upon his children, which are these

1 To try whither we will prefer him before them, and can love him better then
them. Job. 1.

2 To make us his stewards in an holy dispensation of them. Mat. 25.

3 To be pledges unto us, and furtherances of spiritual blessings. Genesis 17. 1.

4 That we may humbled to give him the glory of the^. To. 11. 36.

And therefore,

1 We must not set our hearts upon them but keep them entirely to God. Psalm.
62.

2 We must not be puffed up with them. Psalm. 75.

3 We must not tie, nor measure God only by them. Psalm 30. 6.

4 We must be willing for his sake to part with them either for the good of
others or to avoid our own hurt. Mat. 10. 37.

5 And all this not as if they were ours, but Gods to dispose wholly to his
glory, and the good of his church and children. Matt. 19. 29 13. Colos. 3. 23.
Romans 12.

Secondly, because the over high conceit of these things is no small occasion
to bewitch our hearts with them, therefore let us labor to rectify our
judgments concerning prosperity that so our ouerweening opinion thereof may be
abated, and our affections rectified therein.

To this end.

First, Sect. 3. Considerations to this purpose.
consider we that though they are Gods blessings, yet they are given for the
most part to evil men and become snares and pits unto them. Ps. 69. and
therefore, if there were no other pre-eminence, even the wicked in these excel
us. 1. Tim. 6.

2 Acknowledge we that the best have bin tainted and much defaced by them, and
behold we in their example what may befall us, as Solomon and David.

3 That they neither have bin, nor shall be any certain inheritance to the
best, but have changed their master according to the good pleasure of the giver.

4 That we deserve not the least of the^, and with all our industry without Gods
blessing cannot compass them, and when we have them they are but lent us.

5 That in the judgment of the best they are but vanity, and breed vexation of
spirit; Nay, that indeed they are nothing, yea less then nothing. Eccles. 1.
2. 1. Cor. 7.

3 We must be careful in the right dispensation of them.

And that in this manner:

First, We must principally honor God with our substance. Prouer. 3.

And this is done,

1 By acknowledging we have al of his free mercy. Genesis 32.

2 Willingly consessing from what a low estate the Lord has raised us. Genesis 32.

3 By thankefulnes unto him for the least as well as for the greatest. 1. Tim.
6. 8. Ephesians. 5. 20.

4 By faithfulness in a lower state, that so the Lord may increase us. Matt. 25.
and this is performed:

1 By following our calling, as co^tentedly and hu^bling our selves therein
being increased, as when we began with nothing. De. 8. 11. Phi. 4. 11, 12

2 We must now much more be open handed, and that especially to the household of
faith. 2. Cor. 9. Gal. 6. 10.

3 We must not think it enough to comfort the body, but we must also minister
to the soul, which few rich men make conscience of, neither indeed are able to
perform. Ge. 18

2 We must honor our selves in God with the^, by eating the labors of our
hands. Psa. 128. and that not only for necessity but for ornament also. But yet
with these conditions:

1 That we exceed not our callings.

2 That we remember Joseph in trouble. Amos 6. 5.

3 That we be always fitted to spiritual duties. Luke 21. 34.

4 And ready to be abased as we have abounded. Phil. 4. 11.

The trial of the right use of our prosperity is:

1 That our heavenly thirst goes forward with our earthly, Sect. 4. To know
when we have used prosperity aright.
and exceeds it. 1. Tim. 6. Mat. 6. 33.

2 That these outward things weane us from the love of the world 1. Cor. 7. 29,
30, 31.

3 That we are prepared to suffer afflictions. Luke 9. 23.

4 That though we give these things their due, yet we account them al as dung
in respect of Christ. Phil. 3. 8.

5 That we make them our servants to our Christian callings. Luke 16. 19.

Helps hereunto are:

1 To consider, Sect. 5. Helps hereto.
we are but strangers and pilgrims in this life, and therefore had need to go
lightly on our journey. 1. Pet. 2. 11.

2 We are but tenants at will. 1. Tim. 6. 17.

4 Stewards for other. Luke 16.

4 Must give up a large account at the day of Christ Jesus. Luke 12. 48

CHAP. XXV.
AND this is the next occasion daily occurring even to use adversity a right.
Of adversity and the right use thereof.


A direction very needful.

1 Because the dearest children of God have failed herein. Sect. 1. How
necessary.
Psalm 73.

2 We profit in nothing more then in an holy use of afflictions. Psalm. 119. 71.

3 God shows himself in no occasion so marvelous as in this. Psalm. 107.

4 Satan hopes in nothing to trip us as herein. Job 1.

5 The world has no more effectual means to condemn the generation of the
just, then by their troubles. Job 8. Acts 28. 4.

That we may therefore use adversity aright:

First, Learn we to inform our judgments concerning the same, Sect. 2. How
to be used well.
as

1 Concerning the causes:

1 That they come not by chance but are appointed of God and sealed upon us.
Job 33. 15. Amos. 3.

2 That they are imposed in love and of very faithfulness. Psalm. 119.

3 That there is some cause of them in us, though presently not known to us.

And these causes may be,

1 Either chastisement for some sin past, or present. 2. Sam. 21. 1.

2 Prevention of some sin wherein we are like to fall: as security, pride,
etc. 2. Cor. 12.

3 Trial and exercise of some graces of God in us. 1. Pet. 1. 7.

4 Conuincing the world of standerous imputations, as that we serve God for
these things. Job 1. etc.

5 To draw us nearer to God, and cause us to have experience of his power and
goodness. Ioh. 11.

6 Recovery of some graces which by prosperity have been decayed in us. Hosea.
5. 15.

7 Provoking us to a daily judging of our selves, that we be not condemned with
the world. 1. Cor. 11. 30. 31.

8 To weane us from the love of this life, and cause us to long and sigh for
our deliverance. Apoca. 6. 10. Apoca. 22. 20.

Secondly, That we may use afflictions rightly, we must be always prepared
to them. 1. Pet. 4. 12. and that

1 By submiting our wills simply in all things to the providence of our gracious
father. Mat. 26. 39.

2 By considering that we were predestined and ordained unto them. Romans 8.
22.

3 We must in the purpose of our hearts make choice of this ordinance. Mat. 7.
and be ready to undergo it. Heb. 11. 25.

4 That this is the narrow way and strait gate that leads to heaven. Act. 14.

5 That all the saints of God have traced this way before us. Heb. 12. 1

6 That this yoke is easy and the burden passing light, as having the sting
thereof taken a way by Jesus Christ and yet that he bears the burden now with
us. Esaias. 53. and indeed wholly takes it upon him. Mat. 10.

7 That these trobles are enemies to the flesh, and therefore the rather to be
undergone to subdue so treacherous an enemy. 2. Cor. 12.

8 By Imposing voluntary troubles upon our selves that so we may better digest
such as God, shall necessary inflict upon us. 1. Cor. 9. 27.

And these are,

9 Let us enter into the house of mourning, and observe the chastisements of
the Lord upon others, laboring to stir up our bowels toward them, and to
weep with them that weep. Romans 12.

10 At no hand presume we of our strenght before the time, but fear we our
selves, and cast we our selves wholly on God. Mat. 16. 33.

11 Discern we wisely our fitnes for trobles and avoid we al unnecessary and
unseasonable afflictions. Ioh. 18. 8. Mat. 10. 23. 2. Cor. 11. 33.

12 Judge we wisely of the troubles of others and take heed we ad affliction to
their affliction. Ps. 41.

13 Meditate we often of the former ends and benefits of troubles which are
manifold. Psalm. 119. 67.

14 Use we an holy moderation in the time of our prosperity in our diet,
apparel liberty. etc. 1. Pet. 5. 8.

15 Mainetaine we especially tendern^s of conscience and soundnes of heart by
daily examination, and judging our selves, so shall we be fit for any
affliction. Cor. 1. 12.

16 If our estate seem to diminish outwardly let us be contented with it, and
so shall we by degrees be prepared to further emptying 2. Cor. 4. 16.

17 Consider we that we have our captain Jesus Christ to be our companion in
all troubles. 1. Pet. 4. 13

18 And that we have the strength of the holy Ghost to lead us throw them.
Phil. 4. 13.

19 And be we assured of the protection of Angels to defend us in the same.
Psalm. 34.

20 And let us be thinking, of the shortness of life, and so of troubles, and
preparing to death and so no afflictions shall be unwelcome to us. Phil. 1. 20.

21 Forget we not to meditate often on the joys of heaven, that so when
afflictions come we may be encouraged the rather to undergo them in respect of
the inestimable reward which is set before us. 2. Co. 4. 16. 17.

And thus shall we be happily prepared to afflictions and so make a comfortable
use of them when they are upon us. To this end consider further:

1 Not what God has laid upon us, Sect. 3. Helps hereto.
but what we have deserved. Ro^. 6. 23. Da^. 9. 7. Ps. 119. 75. Ps. 103. 9. 10.

2 How long God heretofore has spared us, and in how many corruptions he has
in great patience waited upon us, though now he meet with us.

3 That we are not swallowed up of the cross, which is an euiden^ note of Gods
hand put under, and that the Lord lays no more upon us then we are able to
endure. Psalm. 37. 1. Cor. 10. 13.

4 View we the impatience of Gods children under the cross, to prevent, or
remedy the like in us. Job. 3. Jonah 4.

5 Meditate we on Gods promises, and so quiet our hearts. Ps. 46. 56.

6 Call we to mind former deliverances and so we shall strengthen our faith for
the present and to come. Ps. 77.

7 Take we heed of judging our case singular, as if never any were so much
afflicted as we are. Lam. 1. 12

8 Be we diligent in following our callings to avoid distraction, and prevent
worse afflictions.

9 Pray we for our enemies and the rods of our correction. Mat. 5: 44*

10 Be we earnest with God rather to sanctify then to remove the cross.
Phil. 1. 19.

11 And yet press the remouall, as may stand with his glory, our own and the
good of the Church.

12 Yet with wisdom and patience, neither tying the Lord to the time, nor
manner, nor measure of the deliverance, but for the temporal chastisement,
yelding absolutely unto God. 2. Sam. 15.

13 Be we thankful unto God for the^ and rejoice we under the cross.

14. If we be buffeted under the cross with impatiency, or such like
te^tations: let it comfort us, that feeling these corruptions, and
acknowledging, yea striving against them, it is a certain token of a future
victory.

15 Consider we the evils that are prepared for sinners, that so we may the
better endure light afflictions 2 Thessalonians. 1.

16 Forget we not to compare the present profit in troubles with the sensible
loss, that sin is hereby lessened, and the matter of sin weakened. 2. Cor. 4.

17 Live we especially by faith and not by sense, believing the things we see
not, and hoping the things that are desperate. 2. Corint. 1. Heb. 11.

18 That Gods power is more seen in the issues out of trouble, then in keeping
us out of them altogether, and therefore this serves to the magnifiing of Gods
power. Ps. 98. 1.

19 Hereby Satan also is most confounded, that whereby he labors most to
overthrow the Church, and Gods children, they are by the same confirmed and
profited Phil. 1. 12.

20 Promise we to further others in the ways of God. Psalm. 51.

21 Vow we the praises of God in the great congregations. Psalm. 35. etc.

22 Move we the Lord from the insolency of our enemies. Psa. 119. 126. Psalm. 41.

23 As also by testifying our zeal to his glory, that it may not be blasphemed
of the wicked.

24 Labor we especially to comfort our hearts with the testimony of our
innocence, and that good cause for which we suffer. 1. Sam. 24. 12.

25 Yet acknowledge we before God that we are not clear, and so abhor we
ourselves in sackcloth and ashes. Job 11.

26 If we suffer as evil doers, yet remember we that the cross is not so
much sent as a punishment for sin, as a remedy against it. Psa. 119. 77.

27. Move we the Lord from the sense of our own weakness. Job 6. and utter
inability as of our selves. Psalm. 6.

28 Protest we our faith in God. Job 13. 15. and patience in waiting upon him.
Psalm. 123. 2. Micah 7. 9.

29 Bind we the Lord to us from the manifestation, and making good of his
favor in that he suffers not our enemies to triumph over us. Psalm. 41. 11.

CHAP. XXVI.
THus behauing our selves in troubles we shall undoubtedly find a good issue in
them: Of Family exercises.
heereunto will further much such spiritual exercises as are incedent to the
day.

And these are:

First, to humble our selves often in the day before God in private prayer.
Daniel 6. 10.

Secondly, to exercise with our family prayer, catechizing, reading of the
word, and singing of spiritual^ himnes. Genes. 18. Col. 3. 2. Tim. 3.

And this must daily be performed* because,

1 We are most ignorant and forgetful. 2. Pet. 1. 13. 15.

2 New tentations do daily assault, us which by these means ar^ to be
resisted. Luke 9. 23.

3 Hereby we are fitted to the public duties of the sabbath. Act. 13. 16*

4 The soul is spiritually nourished and has sweet felloship and communion
with God. John 5. 39* Genesis 18. 17.

5 We have our conversation in heaven. Phil. 3. 20.

6 We sanctify all our outward occasions unto us. Job 1.

7 And obey Gods will in declaring his mercies unto our families, and
propagating his truth and Gospel, and hereby approve our selves living stones
of the house of God. Pet. 2. 5.

8 We increase hereby in the heavenly thrift, and strengthen our selves in our
journey toward heaven. Col. 1. 10. 11.

9 We prepare our selves co^fortably to our account and rekoning which daily we
are to cast up. Sect. 1. Of the daily account.
Mat. 24. 46.

CHAP. XXVII.
ANd this is the last duty daily to be performed of us, Even to take an
account of our daily actions. And that:

1 Because hereby we approve and much confirm the same.

2 We purge our hearts of all dregs and remainders of sin. Why to be
performed.


3 We have experience of the excellency and certainty of a christian life

4 We make our account ready against the day of the Lord Jesus.

5 We procure stability and constancy for the time to come.

6 We yoke and diminish our daily tentations.

7 We keep sin from sleeping, with us.

8 By repentance removing it, our sleep becomes more sweet and comfortable.

9 Our labors afterward prouelesse irksome.

10 We walk with God and express the true pilgrims life.

Now that we may the rather perform this duty. Consider we,

1 That the very heathen in some sort by the light of Nature practiced it.

2 That if trouble here be, it is to the flesh, to which we are not debtors.
Romans 8. 12.

3 That it is no more then God commands and christianity requites at our hands.

4 That when we have done all we can, we are but unprofitable servants, and
therefore we had need strive to the utmost.

And for our better direction herein, learn we,

First, that the fittest time for performance hereof is after prayer.

Secondly, For the manner hereof begin we,

1 From the cogitations of the first awaking from sleep.

2 So proceed we to consider of our morning actions, how we have confered with
our God in private, how sanctified our families.

3 Examine such occasions as have befell us in our callings.

4 What use we have made of company, what of our being alone: how we have
received and used Gods creatures, and have bin knit unto God by them.

5 How we have been buffited by Satan, the world, etc.

6 What comfort we have found in the word and spiritual exercises.

7 If thou shall find the testimony of a good conscience and peace, so rejoice
and praise thy God. If thou find thy failings, so be humbled and cast thy
self upon Jesus Christ, in Prayer.

2 Recounting unto God, as near as thou may thy particular slips, and so
acknowledging thy self an unprofitable servant, seek thy peace in the merits
of thy Savior, and so lie down in his bosom, and so thou shall find rest for
thy soul.

Thus far of the daily Sacrifice. The Lord enable us to the oblation thereof,
for his Son Christ Jesus his sake, our most full and sufficient saecrifice.
Amen.

FINIS.
