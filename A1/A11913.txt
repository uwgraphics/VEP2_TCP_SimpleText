THE LAMENTABLE Tragedy of OEDIPVS the Son of LAIVS King of THEBES out of
Seneca. By ALEXANDER Neuyle.

Imprynted at London in saint Brydes Churchyard: over against the North door
of the Church: by Thomas ColWell. 1563. 28. Aprilis.

To the right Honorable Master Doctor Wotton: One of the Queen's Ma^esties
p^iuye Counsel. Alexander Neuyle wysheth Health: with increase of Honor.
WHen first right honorable Sir, I trauayled in the translation of this present
Tragedy, Written by the most grave, vertutuous and Christian Ethenicke (For
so doubts not Erasmus to term him) Lucius A^neus Seneca: I minded nothing
less, than that at any time thus rudely transformed he should come into the
Prynters hands. For I to no other end removed him from his natural and loftye
Style to our corrupt and base, or as al men affirm it: most barbarous
Language: but only to satisfye the instant requests of a few my familiar
friends, who thought to have put it to the very same use, that Seneca himself
in his Invention pretended: Which was by the tragical and pompous show upon
Stage, to admonish all men of their fickle Estates, To declare the unconstant
Head of wavering Fortune, her sudden interchau^ged and soon altered face, And
ly^ely to express the just revenge, and fearful punishments of horrible
Crimes, wherewith the wretched world in these our miserable days pyteously
swarmeth. This caused me not to be to precise in following the Author word ^or
word: but somtymes by Addition, somtymes by Subtraction, to use the aptest
Phrases in giving ye Sense that I could inu^nt. Whereat a great nombre I know
will be more offended than Reason or Wisdom would they should be. Thus as I
framed it to one purpose: so have my fren^es (to whom I can not well d^ny any
thing ye Frendshyps right may seem justly to require) wrested it to another
effect: and by this m^anes blown it abroad, by over rasshe and unadvised
pryntyng. By which fond deed I know undoubtedly I shall receive ye poisoned
Infamies, of a nombre of venomous tongues. Wherefore (right honorable Sir:) as I
give these the first Fruictes of my travail unto you: declarynge therein the
great good will and duty that I owe unto your Honor, for the virtuous
Liberality of your noble mind: so am I driven humbly to re^qyre your strong
aid, and assured Defense against the sclaunderous assaults of such malicious
mouths, which obtaynd: I shall be the better encouraged against an other time,
to bestow my travail in matters of far greater weight and importance. In
the mean season (desyryng your Honor to take these simple Attemptes of mine
in good part:) I leave you to the tuicion of the right high and mighty GOD:
Who keep you long in health, and grant you NESTORS years: With increase of
Honor.

Your Honors to command. Alexander N^uyle.

The Preface to the Reader.
Behold here before thy face (good Reader) the right lamentable Tragedy of
that most Unfortunate Prince OEDIPVS, for thy profit rudely translated. Wondre
not at the grosenes of the Style: neither yet accownt the Inuentours dylygence
disgraced by the Translators negligence: Who though that he has somtymes
boldly presumed to err from his Author, rouynge at Randon where he list:
adding and subtracting at pl^asure: Yet let not that engendre disdainful
suspicion with in thy learned breast. Mark thou rather what is meant by the
whole course of the History: and frame thy life free from such mischiefs,
wherewith the world at this present is universally overwhelmed, The wrathful
vengeance of God provoked, The Body plaged, the mind and Conscience in midst
of deep devouring dangers most terrybly assaulted, In such sort that I
abhor to write: And even at the thought thereof I t^emble and quake for very
inward grief and fear of mind, assure^^y perswadinge my self that the right
high and immortal God, will never leave such horrible and detestable Crimes
unpunished. As in this present Tragedy, and so forth universally in the
general Process of the whole History, thou may right well perceive. Wherein
thou shall se, a very expres and lively Image of the inco^stant change of
fickle Fortune in the person of a Prince of passing fame and Renown, midst
whole studs of earthly bliss: by meare misfortune, nay rather by the deep
hidden secret Judgments of God pyteouslye plunged in most extreme myseries.
The whole Realm for his sake in straungest guyse greuouslye plaged: besides
the apparaunt destruction of the Nobility, The general death and spoil of
the Cominaltie, The miserable transformed face of the City, with an infynyte
Legion of mischiefs moore, which I pass over vnrehersed. Only wysh I all
men by this Tragical History (for to that intent was it written) to beware of
Sin: the end whereof is shameful and miserable. As in the most Unfortunate
fall of this unhappy Prince right plainly appears. Who by inward Gripe of
fearful consuming Concience wretchedly tormented: beholdynge the lamentable
state of his vile infected Realms, wasted by the burning rage of privy
spoylynge Pestilence, fyndes him self in tract of Time, to be the only Plage
and myserye of the almost quight destroyed City. Whereupon calling together
his Preests and Prophettes, and askyng counsel of the Gods by them, for
present Remedy in those Evils, wherewith the Realm was than universally
overflowed, Answer was made that the Plague should never ceas, till King
LAIVS Death were thoroughly revenged: and the bluddy Murderer driven into
perpetual exyle. Which Answer received OEDIPVS far more curious in
bowlting out the truth, than careful of his own Estate: suddenly slides into
an innumerable company of right dreadful myseries For as soon as he had once
the perfect vewe of his own detestable deeds and wicked misdemeanour cast
before his eyes, together with the unnatural killing of his Father LAIVS, the
incestuous Marriage of his Mother IOCASTA. The preposterous order of his ill
mysguyded life, with a hundred mo ^ike mischiefs, which chaste and undefiled
ears abhor to hear, frettyng Fury common enmy and tormentor to corrupted
conscience prickyng him forward, all inflamed with Frenzy and boylyng in
inward heat of vile infected mind, he rooteth out his wretched eyes
unnaturally, spoyleth his Mother of her life (though earnestly requested
thereto) beastly, and in the end in most basest kind of slauerye, banished:
dies myserably. Leaving behynd him unto all posterities A dredful Example of
Gods horrible vengeance for Sin. Such like Terrors as these requires this our
present Age, wherein Uice has c^yefest place, and Virtue put to ^yght: lies as
an abject languishynge in great extremytie. For the which cause, so much the
rather have I suffered this my base translated Tragedy to be publyshed: from
his Author in word and Uerse far transformed, though in Sense little altered:
and yet oftentimes rudely increased with mine own simple Inue^tion more rashly
I co^fes than wisely, wyshynge to please all: to offend none: But whereas no
man ly^es so vpryghtly, whom slaundring toonges l^aue vndyffamed: I refer my
self to the Judgment o^ ye wysest, little esteaming the prejudicial mouths of
such carping Merchants, which suffer no men's doings almost to escape
undefiled. In fine I beseech all together (if so it might be) to bear with my
rudenes, and consydre the grosenes of our own Country language, which can
by no means aspire to the high lofty Latinists Style. Mine only intent was to
exhort men to embrace Virtue and shun Uice, According to that of the right
famous and excellent Poet Virgyl. Discite iusticiam moniti and non temnere
diuos.
This obtained: I hold my self throughlye contented: In the mean season I
end: wyshyng all men to fly Sin: the present Path way to perfect Infelycitie.

Farewell.
The names of the Speakers of this Tragedy.
Oedipus. Chorus. Tiresias. Senex. Iocasta. Creon. Manto P^orbas. Nuntius.
The first Act.
Oedipus. Iocasta. Oedipus. THe night is gone. and dredful day
begins at length to appear
And Lucifer beset with Clouds,
himself aloft does rear.
And gliding forth with heavy hew,
A dolful blase does bear (in Skies.)
Now shall the houses void be seen,
with Plagues devoured quight:
And slaughter yt the night has made,
shall day bring forth to light.
Does any man in Princely thro^e
rejoice? O bryttle Joy
How many ills? how fair a face?
and yet how much annoye
In the does lurk, and hidden lies?
what heaps of endless strife?
They judge amys, yt deame ye Prince
to have the happy life.
For as the mountayns houge and hie,
the blustryng winds withstand,
And craggy Rocks, the b^l^hing fluds
do dash and beat fro land.
Though that the seas in qui^t are
and naught at all do foam:
So kingdoms great submytted lie,
to Fortunes doulfull Dome.
How well shund I my father dear
P^lybus scepters late?
Exilde^ bereft of carfull fear,
in Pilgrims happy state.
I call the Gods to witness hear
and ^^ars that glyde in skies.
A kingdom is befauln to me,
I fear lest hereof rise
A mischief, (mighty Jove,) to great
I fear alas I fear
Lest these my hands have spoyld the life,
of the my father dear.
Appollo byds me this beware,
and yet a mischief more,
Foretelles. Can any greater be
then this I told before?
Of father slain by sons own hand?
My shyuering lyms do shake
And all amassed quaking stand
at this unhappy Fate.
I am asshamed my des^nies foul,
at large to thunder out,
And openly to blase my fear.
my dreadful mind does doubt.
Yet out it goes. Phebu^ me bids
my mothers beds to fly.
As though that I her son with her,
incestuouslie should ly,
This fear and only this my dryues
from fathers kingdoms great.
Not like a wanderyng Uacabounde
the ways unknown I beat,
But all mystrust^ull of my self
thy laws (O Nature) for to keape
I sought the means. Yet fear I still
and fear into my mind does creape
Though cause of Dread not one I s^
yet fear and dread I all.
And scante in credit with my self,
I seek my fatal fall
(By Dome of doulful Destinies.)
For what should I suppose the cause?
A Plage that is so general
And Cadmus country wholly spoils
and spreds it self thorough all?
Should us amongst so houge a heap
of plaged Bodies spare?
And we alone amongst the rest
reserved to myschiefes are?
O heavy hap. And bide we still
alone the spoil to see?
Of Cites great, of men, of beasts,
by plage that wasted be?
And thou amongst so many yls,
a happy life to lead,
Couldste once per^wade thy self (O wretch
without al fear or dread.
Of Phoebus secret Judgments to,
and that in kings estate,
Thou, thou, infected have the air,
in such a filthy rate.
Thou art the only cause of woe:
by the these evils rise,
By the to grave on such a sort,
this wretched people plies.
The fyry flaming frieng heat,
afflicted hearts that wastes,
Is not relyued as wont it was
by cold and pleasant blastes.
The gentle western winds have left
with helthful puffes to blow,
And now the fyery Dog with blase
of boylynge heat does glow.
The Son in Leo burns so hot,
and so the earth does broyle,
That fluds and herbs are dried up,
and naught remaynes but soil,
So thoroughly schorcht and stued with heat,
that moisture all is gone,
And now amongst so may fluds,
remaynes alas not one.
The places dry are only seen
the streams are dronken up.
And water that does yet abide,
the sokyng Earth does sup.
The Moon with clouds quight over cast,
all sadly forth she glides,
And dolfull darksom shades of night,
the whole world ouerhides.
No Star on high at all does shine
but all the Skies are covered,
With black and hellyke hew and mistie
stenche, quight ouershadowed.
The corn that wonted was to grow
and frutefully to spring:
Now to the voided Barnes naught else
but empty stalks does bring.
No part of all our kingdom is,
fre from Destruction:
But all together run and rush,
to utter confusion.
The old men with the young (alas:)
the father with the child
The plage consumes. both man and wife
all beasts both ^ame and wild
Are spoiled by the Pestylence.
No pomp at all remaynes,
That wonted was in Funeralles,
to ease the mourners pains.
Alas this spoil of people made,
by Plage has dried mine eyes.
And secretly within my breast,
the gri^fit boiling fryes.
And that that wonted is to hap,
in most ex^rem^st ylls.
My tears are dry and glutting grief
my wretched breast it fills.
The crased father bears the sonns,
unto their dampish graves.
And after him with burden like,
the mother comes and raues.
And even lamentyng as they stand
starcke ded down both they fall,
And mourners new in like estate,
for them and theirs they call.
Who likwyse in the mydst of all,
their toil and paynfull pain
Do drop into the grave they digd,
and so the place do gayn
(That was prepared for others erst.)
A tomb is made for Noble men
fast on the people hyes
And in their burde^s ^ling. Nobility
all unregarded lies.
For lack of graves their bodies all
to ashes they do wast.
And so half burnt they leave the^ there.
and home away for have
They run^ and more they fetche^ and the^
fire, wood, grave, and all
Does want. And down for very grief
the wretched mis^rs fall.
No prayers auail^ No Art can help
this raging Pl^ge tappease:
For none almost is left alive
each others grief to ease.
Before thine aulters here O God
my feeble hands I hold,
Requiring all my destinies,
at once with courage bold.
And that by death I may prevent,
my Country pressed to fall.
For this: and only this (O God)
Upon thy name I call.
Let me not be the last that dies.
The last that goes to Grave.
Grant this. and then (O mighty love)
My full request I ^aue.
O cruel Gods unkind. O more
than thrice unhappy ^ates.
That only me denied is,
that lights on all estates.
I mean a spedy death alas,
these euyls to prevent:
Leave of thy blubberyng tears
and fly these kingdoms foyld O fool
With rotten plages and botches vile
and graves each where dyspoilde.
All which diseases thou unhappy
ge^te didste bring with the.
Dispatche. away. Go hence. at least,
unto thy parents stie.

Iocasta. What boots it Sir these mischiefs (great)
with piteous plaints to aggreuate.
Stowtlie to bear adversity,
is fitste for kings estate.
The more thy Reygne is douted of,
and when that cares do crush
Thy princely breast. the^ ought ye most
to bear and bide the push.
It is no point of courage stout,
to fortune for to yield.

Oedipus Nay from this breast reprocheful fear
has ever been exilde.
Our manhood is not subject now,
to vain and peuish fears,
But evermore in each assault,
it princely courage bears.
No not a thousand glistering swords
nor all the force of war,
Can once appale my countenance
nor yet my mind detarre,
The very giauntes fyer^^ and houge
in fight withstand I dare.
Not Sphinx his crafty compast words
could make me once to yield.
I saw him belching gubbes of blud
I vewde full well the field
That all to spatterd lay. With blud
and bones quight ouerhelde,
And when yt he on mountains top
with mouth full houge to se.
Stood gapinge all with gredie ^awes
to feed and pray on me,
Often fluttering with his fearful wings
and shaking often his tail,
Began full like a Lion fierce
with threats me to assail.
Of whom straight way the Riddell I.
it rusht into mine ears
With roaring sownde. his wings he claps
the Rock for have he tears.
Desiring with my bowelles still
to glutte his gredy Jaws.
But this mine old practiced head
his subtle question draws,
In pieces at the length dissolved.
And it asundre sawes.

Iocasta. What maks you wish for death to late?
you might have died than.
As for reward of Sphinx destroyed
this kingdom to you came.
(^ou need no more thereof to talk)
The ashes of that Monster vile,

Oedipus. against us does rebel.
That vile misshapen lothsom Beast,
that ragyng Feend of Hell.
Is cause of all the plage that now,
on Thebane City lights.
N^w only this remaynes alone,
if Phoebus heavenly might,
Can any means invent for us,
or way of mercy make:
Whereby these burning Plagues at length
may happily chance to slake,
(that thus our people wastes.)

Chorus.
O More then thrice renowned stock
of ancient Cadmus race.
O mighty Thebes City great,
(O heavy ruthful Case.)
Lo now you lie all desolate,
with Plagues devoured quight.
Both you and all your Husbandmen.
(Oh miserable sight.)
O foul and fearful fates (alas)
what causes all this woe?
O God whence springs this Pestylence?
that us tormenteth so?
No age, no shape, no form is sparde^
but all confounded lie.
Thus happiest now yt man I cownte,
whose chance was first to dye^
For he has shund a thousand yls,
which wretched eyes have seen:
And mischiefs great that us do prese
from him are taken clean.
O God withhold thy furye great,
thy Plages from us remove.
Ceas of afflicted Souls to scourge,
who the both serve and love.
Power down on the^ diseases foul,
that them deserved have.
A Guerdon just for sin (Oh god)
this this of the we crave,
And only this. we ask no more
the cause and all is thine,
A thing not used of gods it is
from pity to declyne.
My heart does pant and trembling cold
through all my lims does run
As often as I remembering cownt
the noble stocks vndun,
By death and dolfull destenies
that overwhelmed lie,
And yet alas the people still
to grave do faster hye.
In long Array all in a rank
by thousands on a Row,
On every side in every streate
to burial fast they go.
An hundred broad wide open gates,
are not enoughe for way,
But throngd the people pestred stand
still in a fearful stay,
And in the mydst of al their toil
with corses on their backs,
The number that before does po^st
the hinder number slackes.
The corses in the streates do lie
and grave on grave is made,
But all in vain. for naught it boots
the plage cannot be stayed.
The sacrefices done to Gods
have to to ill succes,
And such strainge sights and signs do rise
that naught else I can ges^
But that at hand with gastlye paws,
is utter destruction,
With thowsande ylls accompayned
and extreme confusion.
The sheep of rot by heaps as thick
as dogs do fall and dye,
And belching out their wasted lungs
on ground do sprawlyng lie.
And I my self of late did see:
(a sight unseen before,)
As our high priest stood sacreficinge
at the Temple door,
And struck with grievous bludy wound
the golden horned Bull
When down with liueles lump he drops
and members made full dull.
And all ye wound wide bleding gapes
and black goord blud out spu^s.
And yet the blade vnsprinckled was.
The blood it boylinge stues
And bubbles on the ground. Alas
Wha^ do these things portend?
Oh mghty Io^e at length I pray,
some good and happy end.
At length withhold thy hand (O God)
and health unto us send.
Nothing alas remaynes at all,
in wonted old estate,
But all are turned topsey down,
quight void and desolate.
The tired Horse with labor long^
from back his burden tats,
And after on his Masters breast,
his lyueles lyms he squats.
And all his parts in pieces crush.
The Beasts in field that bide
Unkept. Unknowen ways and paths
do raunge and ouerstrid^.
The Bull for lack of food and meat
in field all faintyng lies,
And all his flock dispersed quight,
the sely Shephard dies.
And there amongst the Heifers fierce
his fatal breath expyers,
The Hearts without all fear of Wolves
do live in wretched peace,
The very wrathful roryng sownds,
of rampyng Lions cease.
The vengeance wild outrageous Bears
are now as tame as sheep
The ugly Serpent that was wont,
the Rocky Dens to keep.
Often quassyng poisoned Uenom soups
in inward heat she boyles.
And all inflamd and schorcht: in vain
for longer life she toils.
The woods are not adourned now,
with fresh and lively hue,
The wonted shades are gone. Al things
are quight out of their Que.
No grass on ground does grow.
The earth no moisture soupes,
The Uine withou^en any sap,
his drowsy head down drowpes.
Wha^ shall I say? all things (alas)
are writhen out of course,
And as they seem to me, are like,
to fare still worse and worse.
O mighty God above? when end
these euerduryng yls?
When ceasthes^ Plages? that gyltles blud
thus fierce and raging spyls?
I think but we almost alive,
there do no men remain:
Whom dolfull Darts of Destenies,
on earth have l^ft vnslayne.
I think the darcksom shades of hell
where filthy fluds do flow,
Where plages and vile diseases to
where dreadful horrors grow,
And all the furies brasten loose
do mischiefs on us throw,
With botche and blane of sundry kinds
which sothern blasts do blow,
And wrekfull vexed hagges of hell
do breathe and on us bring
The angry fendes of hell I think
their vengeance on us slinge
And out their mortal poison spue
which they against us bear.
Lo see how gredy death on us
with scowling eyes does leare.
See see. Oh Jove how fast he throws
his Darts. Not one he spares
But al co^fownds. His thretning force,
with stand no Creature dares.
No doubt the lothesom Feryman
the synful souls that trains
Through stinking fluds. his labor loths
that he for us sustaynes.
Such press by plumps to him is made
which still renews his pains.
But hark yet mo^sters more the^ these
the fame abroad does fly
That hellishe dogs with Bawling sound
were herd to howl and cry,
And yt the ground with tre^bling shook,
and under fete did move.
And dreadful blasing Comets bright
were seen in Skies above.
And ghastly shapes of men besides,
to wander on the ground.
And wood and trees on every side,
Did fearfully resounde.
Besides all this strange ghosts were seen
in places where they stood.
And ryuers more then one or two,
that ran all black goord blud.
O cruel plage. O vile disease,
far worse then spedy death.
O we unhappy thrice and more,
who do prolonge our breath.
In thease accursed days and times.
But hark to me a while.
When first this lothsom plage begins
these mysers to defyle,
It takes them thus. A fearful Cold
through al their bones does run,
And Cold and Heat together mixed,
their senses all benome.
Than litel lothesom marks appear,
and all their bodies spotte.
And all the members flaming glows,
and burning fast do rot.
The Lights, the Lungs, the heart, the Gutts,
and all that in ward li^s.
And all the secret parts Iscorcht,
with dedly fire fries.
The blood al clotterd in their cheks,
in cluster lies by lumps.
And it and heat together makes,
great strange and ruddy bumps.
And blud and flesh congeled stands,
in face as stiff as stake.
And ^yes in head fast fixed set,
and often tricklyng make.
And down apace whole fluds they steame,
and clots and drops do tril
And all the skin from of their face,
by flakes and scales does pill.
A thousand fearful sounds at once,
into their ears do rush.
And lothsom blud out of their nose,
by stilling streams does gush.
The very anguish of their heart,
does cause them for to shake.
And what with Pain and Heat and Fear,
their weried lyms do quake.
Then some the ro^ning Rivers haunt,
and some on ground do wallow.
And some again their thirst to s^ake,
cold water gulping swallow.
Thus all our country tossed with Plage
in Grief it waltering lies.
And still desiring for to die,
A thousand deaths i^ dies.
But God them then to hear is pressed,
And death to none denies.
Besides all this, the church some do
frequent: but not to pray.
But only for to glut the Gods,
with that that they do say.
But who is this yt comes from Court
in have with posting pace?
What is it Creon that Noble blood?
commended for his grace
(Of all that live.)
Or does, my crased mind oppressed.
things false for true conceive,
It Is Creon long desired for.
His sight does me releyue.
The second Act.
The first Scene.
Oedipus. Creon. Oedipus FOr fear my body chilles alas
and tremblinge all I stand
Inquaking dred. I seek and toil
these mischiefs to with stand.
But all in vayn I labor I
it will not be I see.
As long as meare repugnaunts thus
together m^xed be.
My mind desirous still (Oh god,)
the truth for so unfold.
With doutfull Dred is daunted so,
that it can scante up hold.
(It self.)
O brother dear if any means.
or way of health thou know.
Declare it out and stick not now.
the truth to me to show,

Creon. Sir if it pleas your noble grace,
the aunswers hidden lies.

Oedipus Who doutful health to sick me^ brings
all health to them denies.

Creon. Appolloes use it is the truth
with darksom shades to duske.

Oedipus. And Oedipus of gods it has,
things doutfull to discus.

Creon. Speak out and spare not man.
The mighty God comaundes.
To purge the Princes seat forth^ith
and that straight out of hand
That villayn vile requited be,
with plages and vengeance due.
Who firce with blody hands of late,
my brother Laius slew.
Before that this performed be,
no hope of mylder air.
Wherefore do this O king. or else,
of hope and health dispaier.

Oedipus. Durst any man on earth attempt,
that noble prince to slaye?
Show me ye slave that I may him,
dispatche out of the way.

Creon. God grant the sight be good (Alas^)
the heringe is to terrible.
My senses all amassed stand,
it is a thing so horrible.
That I abhore to speak my mind,
Oh god for fear I quake.
And even at the very thought
my lyms begin to shake.
As Soon as I Appollos Church,
had entered in afraid.
Upon my face flat down I faul.
And thus to him I prayed.
Oh God if ever thou did rue,
on wretched misers state.
If ever men oppressed thou easd,
or did their cares abate.
If ever thou in present Need:
did present Help declare.
If ever thou afflicted Hearts,
with Cares consumd did spare.
Now show thy dredful force (O God)
show now thy mighty pore.
Scant had I said: Resownding all
the mountayns thundering rore.
And filthy Feends spoute out their flames
out of their darksom caves.
And woods do quake. and Hills do move
and up the surging waves
Do mount unto the skies aloft.
And I amassed stand.
Still lokyng for an awnswere at
Appollos sacred hand.
When out with ruffled hear disguisd
the Prophet coms at last.
And when that she had felt the heat,
of mighty Phoebus blast.
All puffyng out she swells in rage,
and pattring still she raues,
And scante she entered had into,
Appollos shinyng caves,
When out a thu^d^ing voice does brust
That's far above man's reach.
So dredful seemed then to me,
the mighty Ph^bu^ speech.
Than thus he spoke and thus at length,
into mine ears he rusht.
While sprawling still ye Prophet lay
before the doors in dust.
The Thebane Citi^ never shall, The Oracle.

be free from Plagues, (quoth he,)
Except from thence the King queller
forthwith expulsed be.
Unto Apollo known he was,
or ever he was borne,
Do this: or else no hope of h^alth,
to this, the G^ds have sworn.
And as for him, he shall not long,
in qui^t ^^at^ endure:
But with himself, wage War he shall.
and War he shall procure
Unto his Children dear. And cre^pe
again he shall,
into his Mothers womb^.

O^d^pus. Look what ye gods comau^ded hau^
accomplished shall be.
Nor never shall these eyes of mine
abide the day to see.
A king of kingdom spoild by force:
by guile and craft suppressed.
A king to kings the prop ought be,
and chiefest cause of rest.
No man regardes his death at all
whom lyuinge he does fear,

Creon Great cause maks me my princes death
concele and closely bear.

O^pipus (In mind.)

Creon Ought enye cause of fear or grief,
thy duty for to let.
The thretening of the Prophesies,
do still my breast beset.

Oed^pus As gods have wild us for this mischief
mends now let us make.
If any way or means there be,
their suries for to slake.
Thou God yt sits in Seat on high,
and all the world do guide
And thou by whose commandment,
the stars in skies do glide.
Thou thou that only ruler art,
of seas and fluds and all.
On the and on thy Godhed great,
for these requests we call.
Who so has slain king Laius
Oh I^ue I do the pray.
Let thousand ils upon him fall,
before his dienge day.
Let him no health, no comfort have,
bu^ al to crushed with cares,
Consume his wretched years in grief
and though yt Death him spares
A while. Yet mischiefs all at once,
at length upon him light.
With all the evils under son,
that vglye Monster smight.
In exile let him live a slave,
the rated course of life.
In Shame, in Care, in penurye,
in Danger and in strife.
Let no man on him pity take,
let all men him revile.
Let him his mothers sacred Beds
incestuouslye defyle.
Let him his father kill. And yet
let him do mischifes more.
(what thing more heinous can I wish
then that I wished before.)
Let him do all those illes I say,
that I have shund and past.
All those and more (if more may be,)
oh God upon him cast.
Let him no hope of pardon have:
but sue and all in vayn.
All hellish Furies on him light,
for to increase his pain.
Oh love power down thy fury great.
thy thundryng thumps out throw.
Let Boreas boisterous blasts and stormy
Plages upon him blow.
Consume him quight. Fret out his guts
with Pockes and botches vile.
Let all Diseases on him light,
that wretched bodies fyle.
Let these and more (if more may be,)
upon that Monster fall.
Let Harpies Paws and gredy paunche:
devour his members all.
Let no man him regard: or seek
his lyms in grave to lay.
But let him dye ten thousand deaths
before his dieng day.
By this my kingdom I do swear,
and kingdom that I left,
By all my Country Gods that been
in Tempels close I kept^
I swear, I vow, I do protest,
and thereto wytnes take:
The Stars, the Seas, the Earth, and all
that ere thy hand did make.
Except that I my self forthwith
this bludy Monster find
To wreke the wrath of God some way
with solemn Oath I bind.
And so my Father Polibu^,
his happy days outlyue.
And so my Mother M^^^p^,
no Marriage new contriue:
As he shall dye that did this deed.
And none shall him excuse.
What soever that he be I swear:
for that he shortly rues.
But where this wicked deed was don
Creon now tell me plain?
Both by what means? and where? and how?
King Laius was slain.
Passing through Castalia woods,
and Mowntayns heapd with Snow

Creon. Where G^oues of scrubs and Busshes thick
and Brambels sharp do grow.
A three pathde crooked way there is,
that diversely does go.
O^e unto Bac^hus City bends,
that Phocia does hight:
The other to the Land of Sis^phus
forth stretches out a right.
The third at the end whereof,
a lothsom Serpent lies,
Tends down unto the Banck whereby
Eleia water plyes.
The are mynding naught but peace,
a soden band o^ th^ues.
By open force of Arms owtright,
this mischief^ great contriues.
But lo as well as can be coms,
Tiresi^^ with trembling pace.
I think Appollos heavenly might,
has brought him to this place.
Se where he comes and Man^o t^.
his ways directinge goes.

The second Act.
The second Scene.
Oedypus. Tyresias, Manto, Oedipus COme holy priest to Phoebus next
these doutfull aunswers lose.
And whom ye destnies will to die.
Straight ways to me disclose,

Tyresias Renowned Prince though still I stand
in silence dom dismayed.
And though by inward fear of mind
my lingringe tongue is stayed.
^et pardon me (O ^oble Prince,)
and give me leave a while.
From ^a^k of sight ^prings Ignorance
which power has to exyle,
Unspot^^d Truth from doutfull br^sts.
This thing full well you knoe,
But whither god and Country calls,
with willing mind I go.
Let dedlie fatal destenies,
be boulted out at length.
O king if I of greener years,
had now my wonted strength
This matter soon discust should be,
and I would take in hand.
My self in presence of the Gods,
in temple for to stand.
A mighty Ox all coulourd white,
up on the Aultars rear.
Which never yet on weried neck,
the Crooked yoke did bear.
And Manto thou O daughter mine,
mine only prop and stay.
The secret hidden mysteries,
and sacred signs out say.

Manto. The best before the Aultare stands.

Tyresias To Gods a solemn prayer make.
And on the holy Aultars to,
some pleasant odoures shake.

Manto. It Is don. And all the fires fierce,
with incence bright do flame.

Tyresias O Manto now what signs see thou?
how do thy matters frame?
What does the fire, the Sacrifice,
encompas round about?

Manto. Not so. But first it mownts aloft,
and straight it flasheth out.

Tire. Well. Yet, how does the sacred flame
all shining bright and clear
Hit self on high unto the skies,
with sparkeling flakes vpr^are?
Or does it often r^bounding back,
hit self, from skies unfold?
Or all with rumbling roaring noise,
about the place is it rould?
Or mi^t with smoke is it tossed from place.
to place now here now theare?

Manto. Not all one but mingled colors,
the flame does with it bear.
Much like unto the Raynbow,
which having soundry hues,
Does show unto the husbandmen,
the wether that ensues.
What color it wants: or what it has
to me is like uncertain.
Now is it black, now blue, now red,
and even now again
Quight out it is. Yet once again,
all fierce it flashing flames.
But lo yet mi^chiefs more then this,
vnluckely it frames.
The fire quight asounder parts,
and flame with flame does fight.
O father I abhor to see,
this vglye lothes^m sight.
The wine to blud is turned quight,
and all the Princes head.
With thick black clouds enco^past is,
with smoke all over spread.
O father tell what this portends?

Tyresias What should I tell alas?
My mind for fear astonished stands,
and trembling cold does pas
Through all my lims. What shall I say?
or where shall I begin?
O cruel Plages O wrekfull Gods,
O vengeance due for sin.
Some horrible mischief great, alas,
these fearful signs declare.
(O Jupiter)
what is that y^ Gods would have reueld
and yet do bid beware.
(To utter it,)
They are ashamed: I know not what.
Come hither quickly bring.
Some salt with the. Go it upon
the wounded he^fer fling.
How now? Do once resistaunce make,
or do^th it gentlye bide
The touching of thy sacred hands.

Manto His head on high he liftes.
And torning t^ the East, by course
from thence he often shifts
Still lothinge as he semes to me,
Of heaven to see the light,
Often scouling with his blearing eyes
with gastely ruthefull sight.

Tire. What? Does one blow them drive to ground
or more then one they have.

Manto. The heifer as it seemd enflamd,
with cou^age stout and brave
Upon the mortal Blade did rush,
and there himself destroys.
When out the blud it foming spoutes,
and mounts unto the Skies.
The bull twice stroke or thrice,
with groueling groaning tyres.
And toyling up and down he moyles.
and still to live desires.
And yet at length with much ado,
his brutishe breath expiers.

Tire. What? does ye wound wide open gape,
or is it closed up?
Or does the depnes of the hole.
the blod in soking supp.

Manto. Out of the wounded Heyfers breast,
black bluysh waters rush.
And from his nose and eyes, and mouth,
whole streams, of ^lud do gush.

Tyresias By this unhappy Sacrefyce,
great fears within me rise.
But tell me now: In the inner parts.
what secrets hydden lies?

Manto. O father what means this? the inwardes,
moore than w^ntyd guyse.
Do move and styr, and shake my hands,
and heauing often do rise.
The blud by streams out of the vayns,
full strayngely skyppes aloft.
The heart all schorcht and hydden lies,
and strykes are seen full often,
Of Color very wan and pale.
The cheyfest parts do want.
The liver blackysh gaull out spurts,
and somewhat rysyng pants.
And that that myscheyfs great,
to kyngdoms does forshow:
A litell lothsom piece of Skyn,
the heart does ouergrowe.
And ouerwhelms it quight. Wherthrough,
a man may easly see,
How both the heart the lights, and lu^gs,
And all dysturbed be,
No part his proper place observes,
or keeps his order due:
But altogether quight disguisd,
with an unwonted hue.
Misshapen out of frame, trans^ormd,
displaced quight. Alas.
I fear, I fear, some ill succes
in this unhappy cas.

Oedipus Declare from whence and why,
these fearful Signs do rise,
With courage stout I will it hear,
it shall not once aggryse
My valiant mind. Extremest yls
have power to banysh fear:

Tyresias You will wysh yt unhard which you
so much desire to hear.

Oedipus Tell me I say, since that the Gods
will have it to be known.
Tell me, what is his name that has
king Laius overthrown?

Tire. No sacrifyce will serve (O king)
new means must we invent:
From dredful dark infernal damps:
some Furye must be sent
These mischiefs great for to unfold.
Or else king Ditis he,
That Empier keeps on Ghosts,
entreated needs must be
These things forthwt for to disclose.
Tell who shall have the charge,
A king thou art, than may not thou
go through those kyngdoms large^

Oedipus Than noble Creon thou shall go,
this pain is fytst for the:
Who must this ancient kingdom great
enjoy after me.

The third Act.
The first Scene.
Oedipus. Creon. Oedipus THough that thy face with sadness clad,
in heavy mournyng guyse:
Naught else portend: but dedli griefs
and mischiefs still to rise.
Yet tell some means whereby at length
the Gods we may appease,
And purchase to our kyngdoms wast,
some hope of health and ease.

Creon Alas you bid me that dysclose,
which ^eare does bid me hyde.

Oedipus If that the ^hebane Cit^es great,
by doulfull Plags destroyed.
Do the not move. Yet ought thou,
these kyngdoms for to ru^,
Which were unto thy brothers house,
of ancient title due.

Creon You wish yt thing to know: which you,
will wish unknown at length.

Oed. To banish ils: in Ignorance,
there rests no power nor strength.
Will thou in all these mischeyfs seek,
the truth for to suppres?

Creon Where Cure of Care is to be lothd,
I seake not to redres.

Oedipus Speak out with speade, or else I swear,
thou shall by practyse prove,
How great a thing of weight it is,
a Princes mind to move.

Creon Kings often use to wish untold.
Which they bad tell before.

Oedypus. Go to dispatch. Ceas of I say,
to vere me any moore,
Except that thou furthwith thou wretch,
this matter do discloes,
The Gods I do protest for all,
to death thou only goes.

Creon Pardon me O noble king.
give leave to hold my peace,
Of all the pardons Princes grant.
what pardon may be leas?

Oedipus As though ye Silence hurts not more,
oftymes than words ill spent.
Dispatch at once: Styr me no more.
thou know my wonted Guyse,
When Silence is denied: what than
remayns that lawful is?
A traitor he is, that silence kepes
when he is bid to speak.

Creon. Constraynd I am. Receive my words
with gentell mind I pray.

Oedipus Was ever man rebukt for that.
that he was bid to say?

Creon Well than since neds I must: I am,
contented to obey.
A wood there is from City far,
encompast thick with trees,
Where Ryuers rore: and wynds do whyrle
that styr the Stormy sees,
Where grows an ancient Cipres tree
with crookyd bendyd lyms,
With Stretching down his branches old,
unto the water bryms.
His euerduryng bushes green,
which time did never breed,
With ^auours sweet and comely mos,
does largely ouerspreed.
Amydst them all, a tree there is,
with long outstretched Arms:
Whose roaring sownd, and craking nois^
the lesser woods Icharmes,
And ouershades them all. A tree
of monstrous houge estate,
Beset with fearful woods: here is
that dyre, and dreadful gate,
That leads to lothsom Lymbo Lake beneath,
And pyts that ever flow.
Where choked myry mud does stream
with slymy course full slow.
Here when the Priest was entered in,
with comely aged pace,
He stayed not: No need there was,
for night was still in place.
Than all ye ground wide open gape^
and smoutheryng vapors r^se,
And fire and smoke, and styflyng stynk,
mownts up into the Skies.
The Priest with waylyng weed, I clad
his fa^all rod out took:
And entryng in, in black Array,
full often times it shook.
With heavy chere and dolfull pace.
His hoary hear was twynde
With Bows of mortal Ewe. A tree
wherewith the mourners wind,
Their mourning heads. and Garlands make.
In this guyse all arayde,
The sacred Priest does enter in,
with quakyng lyms afraid.
Than in the sheep and Oxen black,
by backwarde course are drawn.
And odoures sweet, and Frankencence,
on flaming fyres are thrown.
The Beasts on burning Altars cast,
do quake with schorched li^is:
And bluddy streams with fire mixed,
about the Aultars swims.
Than on the dark infernal Gods,
and him that rules them all:
With deadly shrykyng voice aloude,
the Prophet gyns to call.
And rouls the Magic verse in m^uth
and hydden Arts does prove:
Which either power have to appease
or else the Gods to move.
Than bludy streaming lycours black
with broylyng heat do boil:
And all the Beasts consumes and burns.
The Prophet than to toil
Begins. And mingled wine and milk
upon the Aultars throws.
And all the Dongeon dark, and wide
with streaming blood it flows.
Than out with thu^dring voice again
the Prophet calls and cries.
And straight as much with mumbling mouth
he champs in secret wise.
The trees do turn. The Rivers stand
The ground with roryng shakes.
And all the world as seems to me,
with fearful tremblyng quakes.
I am heard, I am heard, than out aloude,
the Priest began to cry:
When all the dampened souls by heaps
abroad outrushyng fly.
Then woods with rumblyng noise,
do often resounding make.
And Heaven, and Earth together goes.
And bows and trees do crake.
And Thu^ders roore. And Lightnings flash.
And waves aloft do fly.
And ground retyres: And Dogs do bawl
And Ghosts are herd to cry.
And whyther long of Acheron,
that lothsom Flud that flows.
All stynkyng streams: or of y^ earth,
that out her Bowels throws,
Dead Corpses to receive. Or of
that fyerce infernal Hownd
That at such times does bustlyng make
with chayns, and ratlyng sownd.
The Earth all wide it open gapes.
And I did se on grownd,
The Gods with color pale and wan,
that those dark kingdoms keep.
And very night I saw in deed.
And thousand shapes to creep,
From out those fylthy stynkyng lakes
and lothsom pits of Hell.
Where all the e^yls under Son,
in darksom shades do dwell.
So quaking all for fear I stood,
with mind right sore apalde,
Whilst on those Gods with tremblyng mouth
the Priest full often calde.
Who all at once, out of their dens
did skip with griesly face.
And Mo^sters grim, and stinging snakes
seemd wander in that place.
And all the fowlest Feends of Hell,
and Furies all were there.
And al tra^sformed Ghosts and sprights,
that ever Hell did bear.
With Cares, and all Diseases vile,
that mortal mynds do crush,
All those, and more I saw out of
those Dongeons deep to rush.
And Age I saw, with ryfled face,
and Need, and Fear, and Death,
And Fire, and flames, and thousand yls
out fro those Pyts to breath.
Then I was gone: and quight amazd.
The wenche in worser cas.
And yet of old, acquaynted with
her Fathers Arts she was.
The Priest himself unmoved stood,
and boldly cited out:
Whole Armies of king Ditis men,
who clustryng in a Rowt:
Al flittring thin like Clouds, dispersed
abroad in Air do fly.
And breathing often with diverse forms,
do scud above in Sky.
A thousand woods I think have not,
so many leaves on trees.
Ten thousand meadows fresh have not
so many swarmyng Bees.
Ten hundred thousand Hills have not
so many flakes of Snow.
Nor all the drops and streams, and gulffs
that in the Seas do flow.
If that they might be wayd, can once
so great a number make,
As could those shapes and forms yt flew
from out of Limbo lake.
Both Tan^alus and Zetus to,
and pale Amphions Ghost:
And A^^u^, and after her,
ten thousand Sprights do post.
Than Penti^eus and more and more,
in like estate ensue:
Till out at length coms La^us:
with foul and griesly hue.
All perst with wounds, I loath to speak
with blud quight ouergrown:
Uncomly dressed, in wretched plight,
with head still hangyng down.
A Miser right as seemd to me,
and most of Misers all:
Thus in this case, at length he spoke,
and thus began to call.
O Cadmus cruel City vile,
that still deligh^st in blood,
O Cadmus thou, which kinsmens death,
acowntst as chiefest good.
Tear out the bluddy Bowels of
your Children. Learn of me,
Do that, and rath^r more: than you
would bide the day to se.
Like yls as late on me are light.
Lo Mothers love, (Alas)
Is now, the ryfest fault outryght
that ere in Theba was.
The Cou^trye with the wrath of gods
at this time is not tossed.
Nor Earth nor Air infect is not
the cause that all ben lost.
No. No. A bluddy king is cause
of all these mischifes great.
A bluddy wretch. A wretched Child
that sits in Fathers Seat.
And Mothers bed defyles (O wretch)
and enters in again,
In places whence he came from once
and doubleth so her pain.
And that, that very Beasts almost,
do all abhor to do:
Even of his Mothers body he,
has brothers gotten too.
(O myschief great,) (O dredful deed)
than Sphinx, O Monster more.
Example unto Ages all,
of Gods foretold before.
But I thee, thee ye Scepter holdst,
thy Father will pursue:
And wreke my self on the and thine,
with fearful vengeance due.
All raging Plagues, all Botches vile
I will upon the blow.
And all the fowlest Feends of Hell,
upon the I will throw.
I will subvert thy Houses clean,
for this thy lothsom lust.
I will do this, thou wretch. And the
and thine, consume to dust.
Wherefore dispatche at once (I say)
into exyle drive your King.
That ground that first of all he leaves
with fresh green grass shall spryng
And swe^e and pleasant Air,
and healthful blasts shall blow.
And all the euyls under the Son,
that beastly slave shall follow.
The Poks, ye Piles, ye Botch, ye blane
and Death with him shall fly.
And with him mischiefs all shall pas,
and Monsters under Sky.
And as for him I know he would
depart with wyllyng mind:
But I will clog his feet and hands,
his way he shall not find.
But groping with his aged staff,
shall pass from place to place.
This shall he do. And none shall rue
upon his wretched case.
Ryd you him from the earth in tim^
for Heaven let me alone:
No sooner said, bu^ straight away,
his dreadful Ghost was gone.
And fast by thousands after him,
the other Sprights in hyde:
Than Cold and tremblyng fear began
through all my bones to glyde.

Oedipus That, that I always feared, alas
upon me now is laid:
But slender props they are (God wot)
whereby your Treason is stayde.
Mer^pa my Mother dear,
shall me from this defend.
And Polibus shall purge me quight,
from Actions all that tend
To muder, or to incest vile,
they both shall me excuse.
In such a case no means at all
of trial I refuse.
Lay what you can unto my charge.
No fault in me remayns.
The Thebanes long or I came here,
of La^us death complayns.
My mother yet alive, my Father
still in like estate.
No, no, this is some do^^ysh dryf^,
of you false Prophets pate.
Or else some mighty God above,
does bear us no good will,
And sekes by Plages on us to wreke,
his wrathful vengeance still.
A sir I am glad, at length I smell
your dryfts and fetches fine:
I know the whole confedrats well
your sleyghts I can untwine.
That beastly Priest. That blearcyed wretch
be lies the Gods and me:
And thee thou Traitor in my place
has promyst king to be.

Cr^on Alas would I my sister of,
her lawful kingdom spoil?
Think you such Treason may have place
in brothers breast to boil?
If that mine Oath could me not keep
content with my degree:
But that contemnyng mean estate,
I would clime aloft to be.
Yet should ill Fortune me deter,
from such attempts I trow:
Whose guyse it is on Princes heads,
houge heaps of Cares to throw.
I would advise you sir betymes^
this charge from you to threst:
Least lyngryng long with it at length,
unawares ye be oppressed.
Assure your self, in baser state,
more safer you may live:
And shun a thousand Cares and Griefs:
which Princes Hearts do ry^e.

O^d. And do thou me exhort thou slave
my kyngdoms for to leave?
Dare tho^ attempt thou vyllayn vile
this thing to me to break?
And fearst thou not in such a case
so boldly for to speak.

Creon Thynk you I would them so persuade
which freely might posses
Their Realms? Or those yt need not fear
least cares should the^ oppres.
But as for you, of force you must,
your Fortunes change abide:

Oedipus The surest way for them that gape,
for kyngdoms large and wide:
Is first things mean, and rest
and base estate to praise:
And yet with tooth and Nail to toil,
to mownt aloft always.
So oftentimes most restles Beasts,
do chyefly rest commend.

Creon. Shall not my Service long suffice,
my truth for to defend?

Oedipus Time is the only means for such,
as thou to work, their will.

Creon It is so sir. But as for me,
of goods, I have my fill.
A great resort. A pleasant life:
from Pryncely Cares, exempt.
Al these might m^ diswade (O king)
from such a foul attempt.
Not one day there is almost,
the whole year throughout:
Wherein some Royal Gyfts are not,
unto my Howses brought.
Both precious Pearls, and princely Roobs
and things of gr^ater cost:
Which I let p^sse, lest I should seem
but vaynely for to bost.
In such a blessed hap^y state,
what thing need I require?

Oed. The more you have, I know right well,
the more thou do desire:
Good fortune can no mean observe,
but still she prea^eth hyer.

Creon Shall I than gyltles dye Alas,
my cause and all vntryd^?

Oed. Were unto you at any time
my life, my deeds discryde?
Did any man defend me yet?
or else my causes pl^ade?
And yet I am condemd. To this
you do me lead.
And me expres example give
which I entend to follow:

Creon What if that Innocent I be:

Oedip The guyse of kings you know
Is doubtful things for true to fear
if thence may mischief grow.

Creon The often fearful tremblyng mind,
true cause of fear does show.

Oedip He that in mydst of perils deep,
and dangers has been cast,
Does seek all means to shun like yls
as he has ouerpast.

Creon So hatreds rise.

O^. He that to much
does use ill will to fear,
Unskylfull is: and knows not how,
he ought him self to bear
In kings estate. For fear alone
does Kyngdoms chiefly keep.
Than he that thus does arm himself
from fear all free may sleep.

Creon Who so the Tyrant plays and gyltles
men with force does smight:
He dredeth them that him do dred
thus fear does chiefly light.
On Causers chief A just revenge,
for murdrynge mynds outryght.

Oedipus Away with this Traitor. Away.
In Dongeon deep him cast:
There let his vile deceytfull mind
due pains and vengeance taste
For his deserved yls. Let there
dyre bondage him constrayne:
Bondage the chiefest scourge of mind
that Traitors can sustain.

Chorus.
SEE, see, the miserable estate,
of Princes careful life.
What raging storms? what bludy broils
what toil? what endless strife
Do they endure? (O God) what plags?
what grief do they sustain?
A Princely life: No. No. (No doubt)
An ever during pain.
A state ene fyt for men on whom
Fortune would wreeke her will.
A place for Cares to couche them in.
A door wide open still
For gryefs and dangers all that been
to enter when they list.
A king these Mates must ever have,
it boots not to resyst.
Whole fluds of privy pinching fear.
great a^guysh of the mind:
Apparaunt Plages, and deyly gryfs.
These playsayres Princes find.
And other none, with whom they spend
and pass their wretched days.
Thus he that Princes li^es, and base
estate together ways:
(Shall find the one,)
A Dongeon deep. A very Hell.
A perfect infelycitie.
(The other,)
A Heaven right: A blessed life,
exempted quight from myserye.
Let O^dipus Example be
of this unto you all,
A Mirror meet. A Pattern plain,
of Princes careful thrall.
Who late in perfect Joy as seemd,
and everlasting blys,
Tryumphantly his life out led,
a Miser now outright he is,
And most of wretched Misers all,
even at this present time,
With doutfull waves of fear I to^^,
Subject to such a Crime.
Whereat my tongue ^mased stay^s,
God grant that at the last,
It fall not out as (...) told^.
Not yet the worst is past,
(I fear.)
The fourth Act.
The second Scene.
Oedipus. Iocasta. Oedipus MY mind with doubtful waves of fear,
is tossed to and fro
I wot not what to say. Alas
I am tormented so.
For all the Gods on me do cry,
for pains and vengeance dew,
They say yt these my gyltles hands,
king Laius overthrew.
But this my valiant Courage stout,
and mind from mischief free,
To Gods untried, to me well known
denies it so to be.
Full well I do remember once,
by chance I did dispatche,
A man: who sought by force with me,
presumptuously to match.
And sought by force me to displace,
as much as in him lay.
This I remember well enough,
the strife was for the way.
And he a man of aged years,
and I a lusty blood.
And yet of me are disdayn and pride,
in vain he me withstood.
But this from Thebes far was don.
A crooked three pathd way:
That was ye place for which we strove
this I remember well,
Dear wife resolve my dout at once
and me expressly tell^
How old was La^us when he died,
of fresh and lusty years?
(Or was he stryken well in age?)

Iocasta Betwyxt an old man and a young:
but nearer to an old.

Oedipus Were there great Bands of men with him
his Person to uphold?

Iocasta Some by the way deceived were.
And some deterd by pain.
A few by toil and labor long,
did with their Prince remain.

Oe^ipus Were any slain in his defense?

Iocasta But one of whom I here:
Who valiant in his Princes cause,
full stowtly did expier.

Oed. It is enough I know him now,
that has this mischief done.
The nombre and the place agrees.
The time untried alone
Remayns. Than tell what time he died
and when that he was slain.

Iocasta It Is ten year since: You now renew
the cause of all my pain.

The fourth Act.
The secone Scene.
Senex. Oedipus. Sen. THe Corinth people all (O king)
do call for you to raygne,

Polibus In your own kingdoms.
eternal rest obtain.

Oe. O God what Fortune vile does me does
oppres on every side?
How do my sorrows still encreas?
Tell how my father did.

Seen No one disease but only Age,
did of his life him reaue.

Oedipus. And is he dead in deed? Not slain?
What joy may I conceive?
How may I now triumph? The Gods
to wy^nes I do call,
To who^ are known my hidden thoughts
and secret workyngs all.
Now may I lift to Skies my hands,
my hands from mischief free.
But yet the chiefest cause of fear,
remains still to me.

Sen. Your Fathers Kyngdoms ought all dred
out of your mind to wear.

Oedipus Tha^ I confess. But wretched beast,
my Mother I do fear.

Sen. Do you your Mother fear? on your
return that only stays.

Oedipus I fear not her: but from her sight
my godly Zeal me frayes.

Sen. What will you her a Wydow leave?

Oedipus Now, now, thou woundst my heart.
This, this, and only this alas,
is cause of all my smart.

Senex. Tell me (O king) what ^ou^ful fear!
does pre^^e thy Pryncely breast:
Kings Cowncels I can well concele
that been with Cares oppressed.

Oedipus. Least as Apollo has foretold,
I should a Marriage make
With mine own Mother: ^nly this
foul fear does mak^ me quake.

Sen. Such vayn and pe^ysh fears, at length
from out your breast e^yle.
Me^opa your Mother is not in deed,
you do your self beguyle.

Oed. What vauntage should it be to her
adopted Sons to have?

Sen. A kingdom she shall gain thereby.
Her Husband laid in grave.
The chiefest prop to stay her Realms
from present Confusion,
Is Children for to have: and hope
of lawful succession.

Oed. Tell me ye means whereby thou do,
these Secrets understand?

Sen. It was I that you an Infant gave
into your fathers hand.

Oed. Did thou me to my Father give?
Who than gave me to thee?

Se^. A Shepharde sir, that wonted on
C^thero^ Hyls to be.

Oedip. What made thee in those woods to raunge
what had you there to do?

Sen. Upon those Hills my Beasts I kept,
sometime a Shepharde to.

Oedip. What notes, what privy marks have ^hou
whereby thou do me know?

Oe^. The hols yt through your feet ar bored
from whence your name did grow.

Oedip. Declare what was his name yt gave
my body unto thee?

Senex The Kings chief Shephard tha^ yt was
delivered you to me.

Oed. What was his name?

Se. Old men's
remembrance soon does fail:
Oblyuion for the chiefest part,
does hory heads assail
And drowns their former memory
of things long out of mind.

Oed What? can you know the man by sight?

Sen. Perhaps I should him find,
and know by face. Things ouerwhelmd
by time, and quight oppressed.
A small mark often to mind reuokes,
and fresh renues in breast.

Oedipus. Sirs bid ye Herdmen furthwith drive
their Beasts to Aultars all.
Away with speed, make have the Master
Shepherds to me call.

Sen. Whyther thy Destenies this do hyde
or Fortune it detain,
And closely keep: Let it be s^,
from openyng that refrain.
That long conceald has hydden lien
that seake not to disclose:
Such things outsercht and found oftymes
against the sercher goes.

Oed. Can any myschyefe greater be?
than this that now I fear.

Sen. Advise you well remember first
what weight this thing does bear:
That thus you go about to search,
and sift with tooth and nail,
Observe the golden mean: Beware
bear still an equal sail.
Your Cou^treies wealth, O king your life,
and all upon this lies.
Though you styr not, be sure at length
your Fortune you escryes.
A happy state for to disturb
does naught at all behoue.

Oed. When things be at the worst of them
a man may safely move.

Sen. Can you have ought more excellent?
than is a Princes state?
Beware least of your Parents found
i^ you repent to late.

Oedip. No, no, I warrant that? Repent?
not I, I trow:
I seek it not to that intent.
I have decreed to know,
The matter at the full. Wherefore
I will it now pursue.
Lo Phorhas where he tremblyng coms,
with comely aged hue.
To whom of all the kings flock than,
the ^are and charge was due.
Do y^ his name, his sp^ache, his face,
or yet his person know?

Se^ex Me thynks I should have seen his face
and yet I can not show
(The places where:)
This look is nether thrughly known
nor yet unknown to me
I can not tell. I doubt it much.
And yet it may be he.
In L^^u^ time long since when he,
these Kyngdom^ great did keep:
Wast you not on Citheron Hills?
chyefe Shepharde to his sheep.

The fourth Act.
The third Scaene.
Phorba^. Se^ex. O^dipus^ Phorb^^ SOmtim a charge of shep I had
unworthy though I wear
And on those Hills long since chief rule
on ^ther Shephards bare.

S^. Know you not me.

^h. I can not tell.

Oe Did you once give this man
A Child^ Speak out, why do thou stay?
if so, declare it than.
Why do you blush and doubtyng stand
Truth seeks no delay?

Pho^. Things out of mind you bid revoke
almost quight worn away.

Oedipus Confess thou slave, or else I ^weare,
thou shall constrained be.

Phor. In deed I do remember once,
an Infant young by me,
Delivered was unto this Man:
But well I wot in vayn,
I know he could not long endure,
nor yet alive remain.
Long since he is dead, and rakte in dust,
he lives not at this day.

Senex No? God forbid, he lives no dowt,
and long may live I pray.

Oedip. Why do thou say the Child you gave
is dead and rakte in dust?

Phor. Because that through his tender feet.
an Iron sharp was thrust:
Whereof a gr^uous swellyng rose,
I saw the blood to gush
From out of both the wounds: and down
by powryng streams to rush.

^e^. Now stay (O king) no farther now,
you know almost the trothe.

Oedipus Whose child was it? tell me forthwt.

Phor. I dare not for mine Oath.

Oedip. Thine Oath y^ slave. Some fire here.
I Will charm thine Oath and the,
With fire and flames: except forthwt
thou tell this thing to me.

Phor. O pardon me, though rude I seem,
I seek not to withstand
Your Graces mind: and will not I.
My life is in your hand.

Oedipus Tell me the troth, what child, and whose
what was his Mothers name?

Phor. Borne of your wife and brough.

Oedipus O Earth burst out and gape for me,
devour my body quight,
Or else thou God, that Ruler art
of Houses void of light.
To Hell my Soul with Thunder bolts
to Hell my soul down drive.
Where furyous Ghosts in darkness deep
and endless pain do live.
For the alone, these Plages do rage^
For the these mischiefs rise.
For thee, the Earth lies desolate.
For the thou wretch the Skies
Infected are. For the, for the,
and for thy fylthy lust,
A hundred thousand gyltles men,
consumed are to dust.
O people throw: cast heaps of stones
upon this hateful Head:
Bathe all your Blades wtin my Guts
Show pytie none. Proceed.
Against me vile transform^d Beast
with pains and vengeance due.
Let Father, Son, and wife, and all,
with Weapons me pursue.
Let those that for my sake alone,
with Plages tormented be
Throw Darts. Cast Spears: Flyng stones
and flaming Bronds on me.
O Slave. O fylthy vacabound.
O hateful head of thine.
Confownder O of Nature thou,
to godly Laws deuyne.
Even from thy birth an open foe.
Go to, dispatche, and dye.
Thou have deserved Death. Go, go,
unto the Court the hye.
Therewith thy mother slave triumph
Rejoice as thou may do:
Which have thy House increased with unhappy Children so.
Make haste with speed, away, some thing
thy mischyefs worthy find.
And on thy self wreke all the spyght
of thy reuengyng mind.

Chorus.
FOrtune ye Dame of present lyefe
does all things change at will
and styrryng still, procures grief
such mysers minds to fill.
Which careful ar their states to keep
when boystrous storms do rise,
And blustering winds and dangers deep
setts Death before their ^yes.
Who says he does her fawning feel!
and changes not his mind,
When fickle flight of Fortunes wheel
does turn by course of kind.
These greu^us Plags from private house
to Princely Thrones do flow.
And often their minds with ^ares they fous
and thick upon them strew.
Whole heaps of grief and dyre debate.
A woeful thing to see:
A Princely life to mysers state,
converted for to be.
O Oedipus thy fatal fall,
thy dreadful mischiefs right.
Thy dolfull state, thy mysery,
thy thrice unhappy plyght:
These things shall blase through all ye world:
what heart may the^ rejoice
At thy dystresse? I can no more:
my tears do stop my voice.
But what is he that yonder stamps?
and ragyng puffs and blows,
And often shakes his vexed head,
some mischief great he knows.
(What news good sir with you?)
The fyft Act.
The first Scene.
Nuntius. WHen Oedipus accursed wretch,
his fatal falls had spied,
(And mischiefs great.)
To Hell he damnd his wretched soul
and on the Gods he cried
For vengeance due. And posting fast
with frantik mood and griesly hue,
Unto his dolfull Court he went,
his thoughts for to pursue.
Much like a Lion rampyng wyld,
his furious head that shakes.
And roors with thundering mouth alowd
And often gnashing makes,
None otherwise this miser fared.
A lothsom sight to see.
Besides himself for very rage,
he still desires to die.
And rouling round his wretched eyes
with visage pale and wan:
Ten thousand Curses out he powers.
Himself the unhappiest man
Of all that live, he does accownt:
As justly he may do.
A wretch. A slave. A Caytyfe vile.
The cause of all his woe.
And in this case enflamd with spite
he cries, he stamps, he raues.
And boylyng in his secret thoughts
he still desires to have.
All torments under Son that may
his Cares conceived encreas.
O wretched wight, what should he do?
What man may him releas?
Thus foming all for rage at mouth,
with syghs, and sobs, and groans,
His damned head ten thousand times.
as often his weryed bones
He beats. And often puffing makes,
and roors, and swells, and sweats.
And on the Gods for death he calls,
for Death he still entreats.
Three times he did begin to speak:
and thryse his tongue did stay.
At length he cried out alowd:
O wretch Away, away.
Away thou monstrous Beast he said:
Will thou prolong thy lyf^?
Nay rather some man stryke this breast
with stroke of bludy knyfe.
Or all you Gods above on me
your flaming fyers outcast:
And dints of Thunderbolts down ^hrow
This is my Prayer last.
What gredy vile devouring G^^pe,
upon my guts will gnaw?
What Tigre fierce my hateful lim^
will quight asundre draw?
Lo, here I am you Gods: Lo, here,
wreke now on me your wyll^
Now, now you fyry feends of Hell,
of vengeance take your fill.
Send out some wild outrageous beast
send Dogs me to devour.
Or else all yls you can deuyse,
at once upon me power.
O woeful soul. O sinful wretch.
Why do thou fear to dye?
Death only rids from woes you know.
Than stoutly Death defye.
With that his bluddy fatal Blade,
from out his sheath he draws,
And loud he cries. What now?
thou beast? Why do thou paws?
Thy father you have slain. Thou, thou.
Thou Cayteyf vile.
Thou wretch, you Slave, you Beast, you do
thy Mothers Bed defyle.
And Brothers you have got. Nay Sons
Sons: Thou lie: thy brothers all
They ar. Thus for thy monstrou^ lust
thy Country down does fall.
And thynkst thou than for all these yls
enough so short a pain?
Thynkst you the Gods will be apeasde,
if thou forthwith be slain?
So many mischiefs don: And is it
enough one stroke to bide?
Accownst ^hou it sufficient pain,
that once thy Blade should glyde
Quight through thy gilty guts for all?
Why then dispatche and dye.
So may thou recompense thy Fathers
death sufficiently.
Let it be so. What mends unto
thy Mother wylt thou mak^?
Unto thy children what? These plags
how wylt thou slak^?
That al for the^ thy Country wastes?
One push shall end them all.
A propre fetch. A fine deuyse.
For thee a worthy fall
Invent thou Monstrous Beast.
A fall ene worthy for
The self invent: whom al m^n hate
and loath, and do abhor.
And as Dame Natures lawful course
is brook thou wretch by thee,
So let to such a mischief great,
thy Death agr^yng be.
O that I might a thousand times,
my wretched life renew.
O that I might reuyue and dye
by Course in order dew.
Ten hundred thousand times and more
Than should I vengeance take
Upon this wretched pate. Than I
perhaps in part should make
A meet amends outright, for this
my foul and lothsom Syn.
Than should ye proof of pain reprove
the life that I live in.
The choice is in thy hand you wretch,
than use thine own discretion.
And find a means, whereby you may
com to extreme confusion.
And that, yt often thou may not do
let it prolonged be.
Thus, thus, may you procure at length
an endless Death to thee.
Search out a death whereby you may
perpetual shame obtain:
And yet not dye. But still to live
in everlasting pain.
Why stayst thou man? Go to I say:
What mean these blubbring tears
Why weepst thou thus? Alas to late.
Leave of thy foolysh fears.
And is it enough to weep think thou?
shall tears and waylyng serve?
No wretch it shall not be. Thou do
ten thousand deaths deserve.
Mine eyes do dally with me I see,
and tears do still out power.
Shall gushyng tears suffice? Not so,
I shall them better scowre.
Out with thine eyes, he said: And than
with Fury fierce inflamd:
Like to a bludy ragyng Feend,
and Monstrous Beast vntamd.
With fyery flaming spotted cheeks
his breast he often beats.
And scratch, and tear his face he does
and Skyn asundre freats.
That scarce his eyes in head could stand
so sore he them besets.
With furyous fierce outrageous mind
he stamps and cries alowd:
And roors and rayls, with rampyng rage.
Thus in this case he stood,
Perplexed, and vexed sore in mind,
with deadly sighs and tears.
When suddenly all franticklyke
himself from ground he rears.
And rooteth out his wretched eyes.
And sight asundre tears.
Than gnasheth he his bludy teeth,
and bites, and gnawes, and champs,
His ei^s all bathd and brued in blood,
for fury fierce he stamps.
And ragyng more than needs alas,
his eyes quight rooted out:
The very holes in vayn he scrapes
so sore the wretch does d^ut:
Least sight should chance for to remayn
he rents and mangls quight
His face, his eyes, his nose, his mouth
And all whereon his hands do light
He rygs and ryues. Thus fowly rayd
alas in pyteous plyght:
At length his head aloft he lyfts,
and therewith gyues a shright.
And when he sees that all is gone,
both light, and sight, and all.
Than schriching out: he thus begyns
upon the Gods to call.
Now spare you Gods, spare now,
my Country pressed to fall.
I have done that you did command:
Your wraths revenged be.
This wretched look, this mangled face,
is fittest now for thee.
Thus speaking down ye blakish blud
by streams does gushyng flow
Into his mouth. And clottred lumps
of flesh the place does strew
(Wherein he stands.)
Beware betymes, by him beware,
I speak unto you all.
Learn Justice, truth, and fear of Gods
By this unhappy fall.

Chorus.
OUr life with to^blyng fatal course
of Fortunes whele is rold.
To it give place, for it does run
al swiftly uncontrolled
And Cares and tears ar spent in vayn
for it can not be stayed:
But needs must run the rated race,
of Destenies all decreed.
What ma^kynd hydes or does on earth
it co^mmeth from above.
Then wayling groans powrd out in griefs
do naught at all behoue.
Our life must have her pointed course
Alas what shall I say.
As fates, decrees, so things do run.
no man can make them stay.
For at our birth to gods is known
our latter dying day.
No Prayer, no Art, not God himself
may fatal fates resist.
But fastened all in fixed course,
unchanged they persist.
Such end them still ensues as they
appoincted were to have,
Than fly all fear of Fortunes change
seek not to live a slave
Enthrald in bondage vile to fear.
For fear does often bring
Destnies that dreded ben and mischeyfs
feared upon us slyng.
Yea many a man has com unto
his fatal end by fear.
Wherefore set peuysh fear aside,
and worthy courage bear.
And thou that Subject art to Death.
Regard thy latter day.
Think no man blessed before his end
Advise the well and stay.
Be sure his life, and death, and all,
be quight exempt from mysery:
Ere thou do once presume to say:
this man is blessed and happy.
But out alas, see where he coms:
A wretch withouten Guide,
Bereft of sight. Half spoyld of life:
Without all pomp and Pride
(That unto kings Estate belongs.)
The fyfth Act.
The second Scene.
Oedipus. Chorus. Iocasta. Oedipus VUell, well: Its don. More yet?
No no no more remayns
My Fathers rites performed ar.
What God? on Misers payns
That rues. Within this Clowd has rold
and wrapped my wretched pate.
Ah sir: this is a life alone.
This is a happy state.
This is a case ene fyt for thee,
for thee thou wretch, for thee.
From whose accursed sight the Son,
the Stars and all do flee.
Yet mischiefs more who gyues to do?
The dreadful day I have
Escapte. Thou fylthy Paracide:
Thou vile mischeiuous Sla^^.
Unto thy right hand naught thou owst
all things performed be.
Unhappy man that ever I lived
this wretched day to see.
Where am I now alas:
The light and all does us
Abhor. This look is first for the,
thou miserable Oedipus.

Chorus. Se se, where Iocasta coms,
with fyerce and furyous mood,
Quight past her self. For very rage
she frets and waxes wood.
Like to sir Cadmus Mother mad,
who late her Son did kill:
Feign would she speak her mind: For fear
alas she dares not: Still
She stays. And yet all shamefastnes
these yls have quight exild
(From out her wretched breast.)

Iocasta Feign would I speak, I am afraid
for what should I the call
My Son? dowt not. Thou art my Son
My Son thou art for all
These mischiefs great. Alas, alas,
my Son is ashamd of me.
O cruel Son. Where do thou turn
thy face? Why do thou flee
From me? From me thy Mother dear
Why do thou shun my sight?
And leave me thus in myserye
with Cares consumed quight.

Oedipus. Who troubles me? Let me alone.
I thought not to be fownd:
Who now restores mine eyes to me
my Mother, or my Mothers sownd?
Our labor all is spent in vain,
now may we meet no more.
The Seas divide those meetings vile
that we have had before.
The gaping year^h deuyde us both,
the one from the other quight.
Still let our feet repugnant be.
So shall I shun the light
(That most of all me greues.)

Iocasta The Destenies ar in faut. Blame the^.
Alas, alas, not we.

Oedipus Spare now. Leave of to speak in vain
Spare now O Mother me,
By these Relyques of my dismembered
body I thee pray.
By mine unhappy Children pledges
left. What shall I say?
By all the Gods I thee beseech,
By all that in my name,
(Is either good or bad)
Let me alone. To trouble me,
Alas you are to blame.

Iocasta O woofull Soul O wretched heart
Why do thou faint alas?
Why do thou seek and toil in vain
these ills to ouerpas.
What mean these sighs and boiling tears?
Why do you pains refuse?
Thou mate of all his mischiefs thou,
by whose means only rues
The law of nature all: by whom
Ah, Ah, counfonnded lies,
Both god and man and be and all
that either lives or dies.
Die you. dispatch at once. thrust through
thy vile incestruous breast.
Not thou if god him self, if he
his flaming fires should throw
On thee, or mischeifs all by heaps
upon thy body strew
Could once repay dew payns
for thy deserved yls.
(Thou filthy wretch: Thou wicked Mother thou.)
Death death now best co^tenteth me
than seek a way to dye.
So may thou yet at length find end
for this thy myserye.
O Son lend me thy hand, if that
thou art a Paracide?
This labor last of all remayns:
this labor thee does bide.
Dispatche rid me thy Mother dear
from all my wretched woe.
It will not be. No prayers move.
Thy self this deed must do.
Take up this sword. Go to. With this
thy husband once was slain.
Thy Husband? Thou termst him falls.
Thy father he was. O dedly pain.
Shall I quight through my breast
or through my throat it thrust?
Can you not choose thy wound? Away
dye dye, alas thou must.
This breast. This womb. Than wou^d
this, this, with thine own hand.
Strike, perce, and spare it not:
which both a Husband: and
(The same a Son did bear.

Chorus. Alas alas, she is slain, she is slain,
dispatched with a push:
Who ever saw the like to this:
Se how the blud does gush
From out her wounded breast.
(O heavy dolfull Case.)

Oedipus Thou God. Thou teller out of fates.
On thee, on thee, I call,
My Father only I did owe,
unto the Destenies all.
Now twyse a Paracide and more
than I did fear mischeuous
My Mother I have slain. Alas
I am the cause. Its thus.
O Oedipus accursed wretch,
lament thine own Calamity,
Lament thy state, thy gryefe lament,
thou Caytyfe borne to myserye.
Where wylt thou become alas?
Thy face where wylt thou hyde:
O miserable Slave, can thou
such shameful torments bide?
Can you which have thy Parents slain
Can thou prolong thy life?
Will thou not dye? deseruyng Death
Thou cause of all the gryefe
And Plages, and dreadful mischiefs all
that Th^bane City preas.
Why do thou seek by longer life.
thy sorrows to encreas?
Why do thou toil and labor thus
in vain? It will not be.
Both God and man: and beast, and all
abhor thy face to see.
O E^rth why gapst thou not for me?
Why do you not unfold
Your selfs you gates of Hell me to re^eyue?
Why do you hence wthold
The fyerce infernal Feends from me,
from me so wretched wight?
Why break not all the Furyes lose?
this hateful head to smyght
With Plages: which them deserved has
Alas I am left alone
Both light, and sight, and comfort all
from me (O wretch) is gone.
O cursed head: O wicked wight,
whom al^ men deadly hate.
O Beast what meanst you still to live
in this unhappy state.
The Skies do blush and are ashamd,
at these thy mischiefs great:
The earth laments, the heavens weep
the Seas for rage do freat.
And blustering rise, and storms do styr,
and all thou wretch for the:
By whose incestuous lothsom lust
all things dysturbed be.
Quight out of course displaced quight
O cursed fatal day.
O mischiefs great. O dreadful times
O wretch, away away.
Exyle thy self from all men's sight
thy life half spent in myserye.
Go end: consume it now outright:
in thri^e as great Calamity.
O lyeng Phebe I have done more
than my Destnie was to do.
With tre^blyng fearful pa^e go forth^
thou wretche^ Monster go.
Grope out thy ways on knees in dark
thou miserable slave.
So may thou yet in tract of time,
due pains and vengeance have
For thy mischeuous life: Thus thus,
the Gods themselves decree:
Thus thus thy fates: thus thus ye skies
appoint it for to be.
Than headlong hence: with a mischief hence
O Caytife vile away:
Away, away, thou monstrous Beast
Go. Ron. Stand. Stay.
Lest on thy Mother thou do fall.)
All you that weryed bodies have,
with syckenes ouerprest:
Lo now I fly: I fly away.
The cause of your unrest,
(I fly.)
Lift up your heads: A better state
of Air shall straight ensewe,
When I am gone for whom alone
these dreadful mischiefs grew.
And you that now, half dead yet live
in wretched mysers case,
Help those who^ present torments pres
forth, hye you on apace.
For lo, with me I carry hence
all mischiefs under Skies.
All cruel fates, Diseases all
that for my sake did rise,
With me they go: with me, both grief
Plage, Pocks, Botch, and all
The yls that either now you pres
or ever after shall.
With me they go. With me, with me.
These Mates ben meetst of all
(For me.)
