The Coaches Overthrow. OR, A Ioviall Exaltation of diverse Tradesmen, and
others, for the suppression of troublesome Hackney Coaches.
To the tune of, Old King Harry.


AS I passed by this other day,
where Sack and Clarret spring;
I heard a mad crew by the way,
that loud did laugh and sing,
High down, dery dery down,
with the hackney Coaches down;
It Is cried aloud
They make such a Crowd,
Men cannot pass the Town.
The Boys that brew strong Ale, and care
not how the world does swing;
So bonny, blithe, and Iouiall are,
their lives are drink and sing,
Hey down, dery dery down,
With the hackney Coaches down,
To make them room,
They may freely come,
And liquor the thirsty Town.
The Collier he is a sack of mirth,
and though as black as soote,
Yet still he tunes, and whistles forth,
And this is all the Note.
Heigh down, dery dery down,
With the hackney Coaches down:
They long made fools
Of poor Carry-coales,
But now must leave the town.
The Carriers of every Shire,
are as from cares immune:
So Iouiall is this pack horse Quire,
and this is all their tune.
Hey down, dery dery down,
With the hackney Coaches down,
Farewell, adieu,
To the Iumping Crew,
For they must leave the town.
Although the Carman had a cold,
he strein'd his March-bird voice,
And with the best a part did hold
to sing and to rejoice.
Heigh down, dery dery down,
with the hackney Coaches down:
The Carmens Cars,
And the Merchants Wares
May pass along the town.
The very Sings did pipe for Joy,
that Coachmen hence should hye,
And that the Coaches must away
a mellowing up to lie.
Hey down, dery dery down,
With the hackney Coach-men down,
Pass they their scope,
As round as a rope,
We Will logge them forth of town.
Permonters, and the Informs,
that often offenses hatch;
In all our times the Money-wormes,
and they are for the catch.
Heigh down, dery dery down,
With the hackney Coaches down,
For these Restraints,
Will with Complaints.
(...)
The second part
To the same tune.


THe world no more shall run on wheels,
with Coach-men as't has done;
But they must take them to their heels,
and try how they can run.
Heigh down, dery dery down,
with the Hackney Coaches down:
We thought they would burst,
Their Pride since first
Swelled so within the Town.
The Sedan does (like Atlas) hope
to carry heaven pick-pack:
And likewise since he has such scope
to bear the Town at's back.
Heigh down, dery dery down,
with the Hackney Coach-men down:
Arise Sedan,
Thou shall be the Man
To bear us about the Town.
I love Sedans cause they do plod,
and amble every where,
Which Prancers are with Leather shod,
and near disturb the ear.
Heigh down, dery dery down,
with the Hackney Coaches down:
Their Iumpings make
The Pauement shake,
Their noise does mad the Town.
The Elder Brother shall take place,
the Youngest Brother rise:
The middle Brothers out of grace,
and every Tradesman cries.
Heigh down, dery dery down,
with the Hackney Coaches down,
'Twould save much dirt,
Spare dust, and dirt,
Were they clean out of Town.
The Sick, the Weak, the Lame also,
a Coach for ease might beg:
When they on foot might lightly go,
that are as Right's my Leg.
Heigh down (...) down*
with the hackney Coaches down:
Let Us foot it out,
Ere the year comes about,
Twill save us many a Crown.
What though we trip ore boots and shoes,
twill ease the prise of Leather:
We shall get twice, what once we loose,
when they do fall together.
Heigh down, dery dery down,
with the hackney Coaches down;
Though one Trade fall,
Yet in general,
It Is a good to all the Town.
It Is an undoing unto none
that a Profession use:
Tts good for all, not hurt to one,
considering the abuse.
Then heigh down, dery dery down,
with the hackney Coaches down:
It Is so Decreed
By a Royal Deed,
To make it a happy Town.
Coach-makers may use many Trades,
and get enough of means:
And Coach-men may turue off their Iades,
and help to draine the Fens.
Heigh down, dery dery down,
with the hackney Coaches down:
The Sithe, and Flayle,
Cart, and Plow-tayle
Do want them out of Town.
But to conclude, it is true, I hear
they will soon be out of Fashion,
It Is thought, they very likely are
to have a long Vacation.
Heigh down, dery dery down,
with the hackney Coaches down:
Their Terme's near done,
And shall be begun
No more in London Town.
FINIS.
