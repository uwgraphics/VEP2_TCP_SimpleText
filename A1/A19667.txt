O ye that be my fathers blessed ones come and posses the kingdom that was
prepared for you before the beginning of the world. Go ye curssed sort into

Math, xxv,

To the right worshypful Lady Dame Elizabeth Fane, wife to the right
worshypfull Sir Rafe Fane Knight: Roberte Crowley Wyshethe the Life
everlasting
AFter I had compiled this little treatise (right virtuous Lady) I thought it
my duty to Dedicate the same unto your Ladishyppes name, as to a right worthy
Patrones of al such as labor in the Lords harueste. Not for that I thyncke I
have herein done any thing worthy so liberal a Patrones, but for the worthynes
of the matter, which is a part of the holy gospel of Jesus Christ written by
the holy Euangelyste Mathewe, and is most necessary to be beaten into the
heads of all men at this day, to drive them (if it be possible) from the
gredy rakeying together of the Treasures of this vain world. I do not doubt,
but if god have not given me^ up to their own herts lust they will now at the
last endeavor to live the gospel which they have of long time talked. In
deed it was necessary that God should styr up some to plage such emonge his
people as had offended even as he did often times styr up the Heathen to plage
his people of Israel but yet it is not necessary that the same should
continue in oppressyng the offendars and Innocent together. For so shall they
also deserve the lordis Wrath and in the end be plaged by some other that God
shall styr up to revenge the iniurye done to the innocent sort Moved therefore
with the desire to se the wealth of my country by the pacifiyng of gods Ire,
which (no doubt) will fall upon this realm very shortly, if oppression and
gredye couetise cease not: I have so plainly as I could, set forth in this
little book the terrible Judgment of god (which no doubt of it is at hand) that
if there remain any fear of god in men's hertis it may cause them to stay at
the least way and not to proceed any farther in ye Inue^tyng of new ways to
oppress the pore of this realm whoes oppression does already cry unto the
lord for vengeance. The lord work in the hertis of the rych that this
vengeance fall not on this realm in our days, for doubtless it will be great
when it comes. And if the oppression cease not, the vengeance can not tarry
long. For the lord has promised to revenge his people in haste. This lord
preserve your good ladyship to his good pleasure in this life and give you
bliss in the life to come So be it.

Your Ladyships at commandment Robert Crowley.

When Christ shall come
to judge us all
And give each one Mat. xvi.

as he has wrought
His fathers frendis
then will he call
To enjoy that
which they have sought
By beleueng
that they were bought
With his blood shed
upon a tree
As by their workis Mat. vii.

all men may see
Come, come, shall he say
to these men
Come and possess
for evermore Mat. xxv.

That kingdom which
my father when
No world was made
laid up in store
For you, whom he
did know before
To be in manners
Romans viii
like to me
That am his son
and aye have be
Come shall he say
for aye when I
Stood need of meat
ye gave me fode
Mat. xxv.
So did you drink
when I was dry
Reioyceng when
you did me good
No fend therefore
shall chaynge your mode
For you shall
always be with me
And shall my fathers
i. Cor. xiii.
godheade se
And at all times
when I have been
Of needful lodgeynge
Mat. xxv.
desolate
You have been glad
to take me in
Whether it were
yarly or late
You did me never
chyde nor rate
But gave me wordis
curteyse and kind
Procedynge from
a faithful mind.
So when I was
naked and bare
Having no clothes
my flesh to hyde
from your own backs Mat. xxv.

then did you spare
'nd gave me clothes
for back and side
So that I might
the cold abide.
But if you lackt
sufficient
Then did you my
great lack lament.
Infyne, when I
was weak and sick
And had no conforte
about me
To come to me
you did not stycke
Mat. xxv.
And succor my
necessity
And when it chanced
me to be
In prisone and
could not get out
To ransom me
you went about.
Then shall the just
Mat. xxv
answer again
And say, O lord,
when saw we the
In prisone or
in other pain
Through extreme need
and poverty?
Art not thou lord
of land and see?
What? lord we know
that sea and land
Have evermore
been in thine hand
we know that thou
gaueste all thing i. Cor. iiii.

To all estates
does high and low
There is no mighty
lord nor king
But he is in
thine hand we know.
In vain lord we
might plant and sow
If thou gave us not
fruit and grain
We could have naught
life to sustain
Then shall Christ say,
all this is true
I gave you life.
and did you feed
With graynes and fruitis
does old and new
And gave you all thyngis
at your need
In all your ways
I was your speed
And gave you that
wherefore ye sought
wych without me
John. xv.
had come to naught.
Yet all that I
have said before
Is true also,
for when you gave
Ought to such as
were sick or sore
Whom need constray
forto crave
Then I confess
my self to have
Mat. xxv
Received all that
at your hand
Whereof they did
in great need stand.
Then shall the just
with joy enter
Into the joys
that shall not end
Because their hertes
were aye tender
To give such thyngis
as god did send
Mankind from peryle
to defend. Mat. v.

Thus shall they live
in joy and bliss
In paradise
where no pain is.
But to the wicked
Christ shall say.
Avoid from me
ye wicked sort
For in my need
you said me nay Mat. xxv.

With spytefull wordis
of disconforte
Yet my preachars
did you exhort
Me in my members
to refreshe i. Corhi. x.

knoweynge that all
are but one flesh.
Then shall these men
Mat. xxv.
with faynte herie say
Lord when did we
see the in need?
Thou haste been lord
and King always
No wight was whom
thou dydest not feed
All this we learned
in our Creed,
For thou art Jesus,
that Gods son
That has create
boeth son and moan.
Oh, shall Christ say
to them again,
Ye deaf dorepostis
could ye not hear?
i. Cohr. xii
Think you the head
bydeth no pain
When the members
make heavy there?
In you, naught but
flesh does appear.
For if my spirit
in you had been
Me in mine you
must nedis have seen.
The pore, the pore,
and indigent
Came unto you
often times ye know
And you saw them
weep and lament
Yet would ye not
on them bestow
The least fruit
that to you did grow
No no, you were
ready to take
That other gave them
for my sake.
Your hertis were hardee
then the flynt
In them no pity Ezech. 33.

could be found
Your greedye gutte
could never stynt
Till all the good
and fruitful ground
Were hedged in
whythin your nownde.
You wicked sort,
how used ye,
The londis and goodis
ye had of me?
You made your boaste
all was your own
To spare or spend,
at your own will
And when any
pore men were known
Mat. xxi*
That were so bold
to call it ill
My landis and goodis
in waste to spyll
You shet them up
in prisone strong?
Tormentynge them
ever emonge.
False libertynes
you did them call
Because they told
you your duitie
You said the loselles
would have all
That you had gotten
paynfully
And kept long time
most carefully,
But ye belie them
I know well
And slander this
my true Gospel
Emonge all mine
there is not one
That would have ought
more then his own
As I shall tell you
plain anon
For to me all Luke. xvi.

their hertis be known
They reaped naught
that you had sown.
But wylled you
to let them have
That I gave you
mankind to save
Not one so blind
emonge you all
But he knows I
made all of naught
Appoyntynge all thyngis

To serve mankind,
whom I have wrought
Like to my self

Willing that each

Have bread and Broth.
harbor and wede.
But sith it was
expedient
That emonge all
there should be some
Always sick, sore
and impotent,
I endued you
with such wisdom
As did honest
stuardis become
Cammittyng whole Mat. 24.

into your hand
The riches boeth
of sea and land.
My purpose was
that you should have
Always all needful
things in store
To succor such
as nedis must crave
Of you thyngis needful
evermore
I made you rych
to feed the pore
But you like seruauntis
prodigal
Have in excess Mat. 24

consumed all
But when I found
you negligent
In fedynge of
my family
Then my prophets
to you I sent
Commaundyng that
you should yearly
Malc. iii
Bring all your tithes
diligently
Into my barn
that there might be
Meat in mine house
for poverty.
But you gave to
their wordis no head
You held all fast
and would naught bring
Into my barn
the pore to feed
But spent all at
your own liking
Gene. 32.
In wantones
and banketynge
And in raiment
past your degree
As men that had
no mind of me
Yea some of you
were not content
To hold fast that
ye should have brought
Into my barn,
there to be spent
But gredyly John. x,

ye begde and bought
That my true seruantis
as they ought
Did at my true
prophetis bidding
Into my barn
faithfully bring
And when you had
once gotten in
Into my fold
emonge my sheep
Then you thought it
to be no sin
Still in your kennells
forto sleep
Setting such ones
my flock to keep
As were more like
John. x.
to eat the lamb
Then to defend
his feeble dame
Ezech. 34.
Ye robde, ye spoylde,
ye bought, ye sold
My flock and me,
in every place
Ye made my blood
vylar then gold
And yet ye thought
it no trepasse
O wicked sort
void of all grace
Avoid from me
down into hell
With lucifer
there shall ye dwell
Ye had the tithes
of men's increase
That should have fed
Ezech. 34.
my flock and me
But you made your
selfs well at ease
And took no thought
for poverty
It did not grieve
you forto se
My flock and me
suffer great need
For lack of meat,
harbor and wede.
No Hell can be
a worthy pain
For your offense
it is so great
For you have robbed
me and slain
My flock for lack
of needful meat
The woule, the lamb
the malt and wheat
You did by force carry away
And no man durst
once say you nay,
How can you look
to have mercy
At mine hand? whom
ye would not feed
With that was mine
even of duty
To succoure me
and mine at need?
Sith you might in
the scripture read
That such men shall
no mercy have
Jacob. ii.
As keep their own
when need doethe crave
Unto the Hungry
Esai. viii
part thy bread
And when thou shall
the naked se.
Put clothes on him,
this might you read
In my Prophetis
that Preached me
And in John's Pistle
these wordis be.
How can that man
have Charity
That being rich
shows no pity?
Also, Prou. xxi.
the man
that stops his ear
At the cry of
such as be pore
Shall cry, and no
man shall him hear
Nor at his need
show him succoure
Right so, Prou. xxii
he that
does endeavor
To be made rych
by oppressynge
Shall leave him self
(at the last) no thing.
For he shall give
the rich always
More then he can
scrape from the pore
So that in time
he shall decay
And have no needful
thing in store
This might you read
and ten times more
In the bible,
that holy book
If you had had
Math. x.
time forto look
But such scriptures
you could not broke
As bade you give
ought to the pore
You wyshed then
out of the book
But you were suer
to have in store
Plenty of scripturs
evermore
To prove that you
might aye be bold
With your own
to do what you would
You thought you might
your goodis employ
To private gain
in every thing
You thought it no fault
to anoye
Such men as were Mat. vii.

nygh you dwelling
Were it by purchaise
or byldynge
Neither to get
into your hand,
Your neighbors house
his goodis and land
All was your own
that you might bye
Or for a long time
take by lease
And then would you
take rent yearly
Much more then was
the tenantis ease Luke. iii.

It was no fault
your rentis to rease
From twenty markis
to forty powndis
Were it in tenementis
or growndis
What though the pore
did lie and dye
For lack of of Harbor
in that place
Where you had gotten
wyckedly
By lease or else
by plain purchase
All houseynge that
should in that case
Have been a slafegard
and defense
Against the stormy
violence?
Yea what if the pore
famyshed
For lack of fode
upon that grownde
The rentes whereof
Math. x.
you have raised
Or hedged it
within your mownde?
There might therwyth
no fault be found,
No though ye bought up
all the grain
To sell it at your
price again
You thought that I
would not require
the blood of all such
at your hand,
But be you sure
eternal fire
Is ready for
each hell fire brande,
Boeth for the housynge
and the land
That you have taken Jacob. ii.

from the pore
Ye shall in Hell
dwell evermore,
Yea that same land
that ye did take
From the plowemen
that labored sore
Causeynge them wicked
shyftis to make.
Shall now ly upon
you full sore
You shall be damned
for evermore
The blood of them
that did amiss
Mat. xviii
Through your defaute
is cause of this
The fathers whose
children did grow
In Idleness
to a full age
Would feign be
excused by you
That were the cause
that they did rage
You took from them
their heritage
Leaueyng them naught
whereon to work
Which lack did make
them learn to lurk
The sons also
that wicked were
And wrought after
their wicked will
Would now right feign
be proved clear
Because your mysse
has made them Ille
But they must nedis
be gyltie still
Because they would
work wyckedly
Rather then live
in misery
And yet shall you
answer for all
Their blood I will Ezech. iii

of you require
Because you were
cause of their fall
That are become
vessels of Ire
Boeth they and you
shall have your hyre
In Hell emonge
that wicked sort
That live in pains
without conforte.
Infyne, all such
as did amysse
Through your defaut,
what so they be
Shall live in pain
that endless is
Because they would not
credit me
That am the truth
and verite
I told them if
Debru. xii
they were oppressed
I would se all
their wrongis redreste
The wicked sort
that did rebel
Against you when
you did them wrong
Shall have their part
with you in Hell
Where you shall sing
a doleful song
World without end
you shall be stonge
With the prick of
the conscience Eccles. vii

A just reward
for your offense.
And you that would
nedis take in hand
To guide my flock,
as shepheardis should
Only to possess
rent and land
And as much richesse
as you could
To lead your life
even as you would
Avoid from me
down into hell
With Simon Magus
there to dwell Actu. viii

If I should rehearse
all at large
That in your wicked
life is found
And lay it straight
to your charge
No wight there were
in this world rownde
But would wonder
Genes. 7.
I had not drownde
The hoole earth for
your sin only
That would be called
my clergy
First (with Magus)
ye made your way
Like gredy woulles
into my fold
Your wicked will
could find no stay
So long as ought
was to be sold
Either for service
or for gold,
By you the patrons
fell from me
And are become
as Ill as ye
You did provoke
them first to sell
And then they learned
forto bye
Thinking that they
might bye as well
As the leadars
of the clargie.
And then they found
means by and by
To catch and keep
in their own hand
The tenth increase
by sea and land
Their own children
they did present
Their seruauntis
and their wicked kynne
And put by such
as I had sent
To tell my people
of their sin
And you were glad John. x.

to take them in
Because you knew
that they did know
That you came in
by the wyndowe
Such as would have
entryd by me
That am the door
of my sheep fold
You said were not
worthy to be
Admitted into
my householde
You thought by them
you should be told
Esaie. xxx
Of your most wicked
Simonie
Your falsehead
and your periutie
Act xxiiii
You laid to their charge
Herecie
Sisme and
sedicion also
But you did them
falsely belie
Thynckynge thereby
to work them woe
And doubtless often
it chanced so
For many of them
you have slain
With most extreme
and bitter pain.
Thus by your means
my people have Been destitute
of sheperdis good
They have been led
by such as drove
Them from the fylde
of gostly food
They beat them back
with heavy mode
And made them feed
in morysh grownde
Where never sheep
could be fed sownde.
The kyngis and Rulars
of the earth
For lack of knowledge
Apo, xviii
went astraye
And you stopped
my seruantis breathe
That would have taught
them the right way
You thought your lyueynge
John, xi
would decay
If kyngis and Rulars
of the land
Should their own duitie
understand,
For so long as
you kept them blind
Making them thyncke
they had no charge
You had all thyngis
at your own mind
And made your own
power wondrouse large
You had an owre
in echmans barge
You bade the princis
take no care
For you would all
the dayngar bear
This haueynge
my flock in your hand
You taught them not
but kept then blind
So that not one
did understand
The laws that I Psalm. xiiii

had left behind
The master could not
teach his hynde
How he should work
in his calling
Fearing my wrath
in every thing
The father could not
teach his son
How in his days
to walk vpryght
But gave him leave
at large to run
In wicked ways
boeth day and night
Making him wicked
in my sight
O wicked guidis
this was your deed
Ezech iii
But I shall requite
you your mede
The matrons and
mothers also
Could not teach their
daughters my law
But wyckedly
they let them go
Whyther their wicked
lust did draw
Can you deny
but this you saw?
And why did you
not set them right
To seek things
pleasante in my sight?
All manner men
were out of frame
None knew his duitie
thoroughly
And you are found
in all the blame
That have entered
by Simonie Ier. xxiii

Which thing you shall
dearly bye
For with Satan
you shall be sure
World without end
still to endure.
For at your handis
now I require
The blood of all
that perished
In placis were
you took the hyre
And let my flock
be famisshed.
For aye ye shall
be banyshed
The bliss that I
bought for them all
That followed me
when I did call. John. x

Avoid from me
down into Hell
All ye that have
wrought wyckedly
with lucifer
there shall ye dwell
And live in pains
eternally
Your wicked soul
shall never nigh
Mark, ix
But live in pain
for evermore
Because ye paste not
for my lore
Away, away
ye wicked sort
Away I say
out of my sight
Henseforth you sh a
have no conforte
But bitter mourning
day and night
Extreme darkness
wythouten light
Weeping, waylynge,
with sobbing sore Mat. xxv

Gnashyng of teeth
for evermore, Luke. xiii.

Your Conscience shall
not be quiet
But shall still burn
like flameynge fire
No burning brymston
has such heat
As you shall have
for your just hyre
The hot vengeance
of my great Ire
Shall be still boylynge
in your breaste
So that you shall
never take rest
Then shall the wicked
fall in haste
Down into the
pyt bottomless Mat. xiii.

Most bitter pains
there shall they taste
And live ever
in great distress
None shall confort
their heaviness
In deadly pains
there shall they lie
And then they would
Apocal. ix
but shall not dye,
Such as were here
so loath to dye
That they thought
no plisicke to dear
Shall there live
in such misery
That only death
might their hertis there
They shall always
desire to here
That they might dye
for evermore
Their pains shall be
so passing sore,
Then shall Christ
with his chosen sort
Triumphauntely
return again
To his father
geueyng conforte
To such as for his sake Apoc, xxii

were slain,
No wight shall there
feel any pain
But all shall live
in such bliss there,
As never tongue
could yet declare.
That we may then
live in that place
With Christ our king
that has us bought
Let us cry unto God
for grace
To repent that
we have mysse wrought
And where we have
wyckedly sought
To be made rych Luke. xix.

by wicked gain,
Let us restore
all things again.
Let the poor man
have and enjoy
The house he had
by Copyeholde,
For him, his wife,
and Jack his boy,
To keep them from
hunger and cold,
And though the lease
thereof be sold
Bye it again
though it be dear,
For now we go
Phil. iiii.
on our last year.
Cast down the hedges
and strong mowndes,
That you have caused

About the waste

Lest you your selfs

When you shall se
that Christ does dry

Restore the fynes
and eke the rent,
That ye have taken
more then your due
Else certainly
you shall be shent,
When Christ shall

For then you shall
find these words true,
You are but stuardes
of the land,
That he betoke Luke. xix,

And you that have

Great store of growndis
or of houseyng,
Your lyueyng thereby
to increase,
And to maynetayne you

ii. The. iii
Fall now to work
for your lyueynge
And let the lords
deal with their growndis
In Territories,
Fields, and Towns.
You do but heap
on you gods Ire
Which doubtless you
shall feel shortly
In that you do
so much desire
The lease of each man's
house to bye.
Esaie. v.
You study no man's
wealth pardye,
But all men se
you do advance
Your self by pore men's
hynderaunce,
What though your liueingly thereon?
Should you not give
them up therefore?
It is Abomination,
And doubtless God
will plage it sore,
Repent, I say,
and sin no more,
For now the day
is even at hand
When you shall at
your trial stand.
Let not the wealthy
lyueynge here
(Which can but
a short time endure)
Be unto you
a thing so dear
That you will lose
endless pleasure
Rather then leave
the vain treasure
O rather let
your leases go
Then they should work you
endelesse woe.
Rehore the tithes
unto the pore
For blind and lame
should live thereon
The wydowe that
has no succoure
And the child that
is left alone,
For if these folk
do make their moan
To God, he will
sure hear their cry
And revenge their wrong
by and by.
Restore your tithes
I say once more
That trwe preachars
may live thereon
And have all needful
things in store
To give to such as
can get none
Lest their great
lamentation
Do styr the Lord
vengeance to take
Even for his truth
and promise sake.
Give over your
pluralities
Ye men of God
if you be so
Betake you to
one benifice,
And let your lordelyke
lyueuynges go,
For holy write
teaches you so
Learn at the last
to be content
With things that be
sufficient.
If you be mete
to do service
To any prince
or noble man
Than meddle with
no benifice
For certainly
no one man can
Do the duitie
of more men than
Of one: which duitie
you do owe
To them that give

Rob not the people

For you I think
it shall be best
To repent you

And call to god
for his mercy
To give you grace

That cross when it

To make an end
let us repent
All that ever
we have mysse wrought
And pray to god
omnipotent
To take from us
all wicked thought
That his glory
may be still sought
By us that be
his creatures
So long as life
in us endures
And that henceforth
each man may seek
In all thyngis
to profit all men
And be in heart
lowly and meke
As men that be

As well in heart
as name and then
We shall have bliss

The book to the Christian Readars
MY brother (the trumpet)
did warn you before
That al me^ should walk
in their calling vpryght
Directyng their ways
by gooddis holy lore
knowing that they be always
in the lordis sight
Who sees in the darcke
as well as in light.
He has cried unto you
all this last year
And yet non emendment
does in you appear.
In deed, very many
do him entertayne
Like as there were none
more welcome then he
Yet I thyncke they do
his warning dysdayne
Because he does tell them
what is their duty
For he is very plain
with every degree
The rych and the myghtie
he does nothing fear
No more does he with
the pore man's falte bear
It pleased my father
to send him before
That he might make ready
and prepare his way
By causeynge all men
to walk in his lore
That have in times passed
wandered astraye
Lest pain be their portion
at the last day
And now has he sent me
that they may se
As it were in a glass
what their reward shall be
I am the reward
that al men shall have
For the just shall have pleasure
and the wicked panye
When every man shall arise
our of his grave
And have the spryte knyt
to the body again
In heaven or in hell
they shall still remain
Or bliss or of pain
they shall have their fill
The good sort In heaven
and in hell the Ill
Behold me therefore
with a gostly eye
And let me not from
your presence depart
For no doubt you will
all wyckednes defye
So long as I shall
remain in your heart
I shall cause you from
wyckednes to convert
So that in the end
you shall be right sure
To live with my father
in joy and pleasure.
Finis.
