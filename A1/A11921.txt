An Answer to the Proclamation of the Rebels.
O Lord stretch out thy mighty hand
against this raging route, To God.

And save our Prince, our state, and land
which they do go about
For to subvert, and overthrow,
and make this Realm a pray,
For other Nations here to grow:
what so, like fools they say.
You do imagine (I suppose)
your selves Princes to be, To the Rebels

Or else your style should not be so, First article*

to send it out with WE.
The Princes phrase ye take in hand,
O well disposed men:
A Traitor first, that word to spoke
and he that ruled the Pen.
Her faithful subjects ye protest
your selves in words to be, ij. Article.

But mark I pray you how your deeds
do with your words agree.
Can you her love, and eke obey,
as subjects in their guise,
When you against her will and mind,
with force of arms do rise?
To all the old and Catholic, iij. Article.

that be of such religion
As you be, that be frantic mad,
and foolish of opinion,
You write: that they your mind may know
and you their mind again,
Whether they mean to take your part
and so in field be slain,
No faithful man you may be sure
will like your crooked style:
Also your train if they be wise
will like it but a while,
Chorath, Dathan, and Abiram
or else Achitophell,
With Absalon, Adoniah,
of their old faith ye smell.
In deed your old religion
is waxen stale for age,
Ye mean to make it new again
with mighty Rebels rage,
You shall have much ado be sure
though you think nothing so:
You have to long a time sit still
and suffered truth to grow.
When God and Prince is ioynde in one
for to defend the truth,
And you against them stand in field,
mark then, what it ensuth.
The ruin of the contrary
must needs with speed be seen
For troubling still the flock of Christ
and such a quiet Queen.
What Nobles are they that ye have
with you to take your parts? iiij. Article*

They may be Noble well by name,
but far from Noble hearts.
Belyke ye would make men in doubt
that some do bear the face
To love their Prince, and yet at need
to turn into your case.
O hateful men unto the bloods
that have always been true,
If you have such, then name them out
from Judas line, the Jew,
That they with speed may hang themselves,
for treason to their Prince.
O doubtful den that so blowth out
a poysonde musing stinche.
Such as you be, her noble grace
has trusted over long,
For now you think that in the field
for her ye are to strong.
It may be so, the Nobles mo
both fathers and their sons
Be puissaunt men to bear a Cross
out of the noble Nortonnes.
You say your faythes is promised
in this your enterprise, V. Article.

Each unto each, to further forth
your meaning good and wise.
What faith is that, what do you mean?
when faith to Prince is broke?
You mean to pull your necks from tie,
of gentle Princes yoke:
And set your selves at liberty
and eke your rowte so rude,
So that to royal dignity
each shall himself intrude.
For this ye may right well believe,
not woorst in all your rank
but thinks himself as good as ye,
and looks for as much thank.
You say her Grace is led by such
as wicked are and evil. vj. Article.

By whom I pray you are ye led?
I may say by the Devil.
Whom would ye point to lead her Grace
if ye might have your choice?
The Pope I think, your Father chief,
should have your holy voyse.
And then she should be led in deed,
as Lamb for to be slain.
Woe worth such heads, as so would see
her Grace, for all her pain.
But this I would ye should me tell:
when she came to her throne,
What was she then, of age or wit?
give answer every one.
Was not her age so competent,
and eke her head so wise,
As none that heard, or did her know,
could more in her devise?
Yea, you your selves (I dare well say)
at that same present hour,
Of all the Princes far or near
took her to be the flower.
And had she not then will and power
her Counsaylers to choose,
To take in whom that she thought good,
and whom she would refuse?
If ye should point her Counsaylers
the case were very strange.
No marueyle though in deeds ye roue
when so in words ye raunge.
And yet good Sirs, this is well known
that nothing has been meant
And done, in matters of the Church,
but by the Parliament.
Wherein the Nobles of the Realm,
the Bishop, and the Lord,
And Commons all gave their consent
and thereto did accord.
The book that called is by name
the book of common Prayer,
Was sent to you, by these before,
though you would it appaire,
By bruting forth that perverse men
seducers of the Queen
Has set it out. O simple men,
what shall I of you deem?
Does not the act that is set out
speak to you in this wise?
Have you not read and seen the same,
and now the same denies?
Will you that be but private men
attempt for to put down,
The thing that was authorized
by her that wears the Crown?
What gappe make you to breach of laws
if this your fact be good?
No Parliament, no Prince shall rule,
but shedding still of blood.
If men may rise against their Prince
that all things does by law,
Then call for Captain Cobbler in
and wait upon Jack Straw.
Ye say ye fear the noble blood
it should be made away. vij. Article*

And ye your selves will do the same
of others that you say.
By force ye say ye will redress
the things that are amiss. viij. article.

Where had you that, out of what school?
show me then where it is:
For in your words, there is inclosde
that will the Queen or no,
You will set up, that she put down:
that ye so mean ye show.
If ye be subjects as you say,
where learned ye to force?
But this ye mean (I do suppose)
with her to make a Corce.
The mother Church you will defend. ix. Article.

What children call ye these,
When traitorously themselves they bend
their Mother to disease?
But like it is, the Mother that
ye mean to prop with power,
The spouse of Christ that she is not,
but Antichrists whore.
For sure I am, the Church of Christ
did never know this way,
In any place at any time
their Prince to disobay.
What fathers of the faith ye be
all men may easily judge,
Who is so blind that cannot see
how causeless ye do grudge?
The ancient customs of the Church
you say you will restore, x. Article.

The liberties that she has had
she shall have as to fore.
You speak but for to make her smoyle
such liberty to have
The Prince and Realm again to spoil
of that that once they gave.
The Monk, the Friar, and eke the Nonne,
the Armit and the Anchor,
You do intend belyke to place
in your most holy Ranker?
God send you all as well to speed,
and make your way as straight,
As such as you had in the days
of king Henry the eight.
O that he were alive, to see
how you his Daughter use.
But he that has his soul to keep,
shall send you shortly news
I do not doubt, fit for your factes
the end of Rebels race,
With shameful deaths to have the end
full fit in such a case.
Good peoples help you seem to crave
to aid you in your stir: xi. Article.

Good people will their Princes wrath
be fearful to incur.
Though you ne recke like bedlem men
your life and land to leese,
Yet shall you find the contrary,
and that in all degrees.
If God by you will punish us,
in deed we must obey,
And we the better for his stroke,
though you be cast away:
For longer then he thinks good,
you shall not sure prevail,
And then will he in wrathful mood
strike down both head and tail.
This is the way to know the foes
of God, and eke our Prince,
Which craftily have kept themselves
and secretly did wince.
Now may the Queen soon find them out
who faithful be in deed,
And cursed Papists by this means
full soon she may out weed.
The hollow hearts will now appear
and subjects true in hearts
Will now like men, both speak and do
and lively play their parts.
And to keep back that forreyne power
should not this land destroy, xij. Article*

Ye will your selves it wast, before
that they shall it annoy.
But how know ye that foreign power
would entermeddle here?
Belike you have them willde thereto
you love your land so dear.
And least that they our strength might find
when they approach to land,
You will if you may work the same,
it weaken to their hand.
The loose of you if you be slain,
as fit is for your sin,
Shall leave the fewer in this land,
to let the foe come in.
A case it is to fond to think
that strangers should refourme
The things amiss within this land
and make it to return
What? is it not a Monarchy?
what Prince has here to do?
Or who so strong that may us grieve,
if we be true thereto?
A Proverb old, no land there is
that can this land subdue,
If we agree within our selves,
and to our Realm be true.
Was ever land so governed
since conquest heretofore,
As this has been in all respects
this.xij. years and more?
What peace, what rest, what quietness,
what wealth, what health has reignde,
What justice has been ministered,
to all that have complainde.
Was ever Prince so merciful
as this most noble Queen?
How she has nursed the Noble bloods
is evidently seen.
Whose head from shoulders has she cut,
though some did it deserve?
Whom has she burnt, or in the iayle
caused that they should starve?
If lenity may make men rise,
or meekness gender ire,
If cold may cause the Coals to burn,
or water kindell fire?
If Adamant may thrust away
the Iron or the Steel,
Or shining Sun the naked man
may cause the cold to feel?
Then may our Queen Elizabeth
be thought to be the cause
Why these Rebels do go about
the breaking of her laws.
But sure it is, her humbleness
that she has ever used,
The Caytifes now most cankerdly
with treason have abusde.
God save the Queen, ye cry alowde, xiij. Article*

with weapon stiff in hand,
To trouble her, whose prudent head
has saved all the land.
Such glosing words, and painted style
are fit for foolish heads,
Or else for babes, whose infancy
do like as leaders leads. (...) the ^^ople.

But now to you the simple sort
leave off from taking part
And speed apace unto your home,
and to your Prince conuart.
Before that God his wrath do rise
by Princes fury wrought
To beat ye down in field by force
and bring ye all to naught.
Do you suppose, a Princes power
your Captains may resist?
There is of you can tell you no,
and if so be they list.
In her most noble fathers days
when he came with his power,
Have ye forgot when ye were up
how each man took his bower?
How often in one year ye rose
the Chronicles does tell,
And yet no boot, ye had no gain
although ye did rebel.
You never hard nor ever read
that Rebels did prevail,
And do you think by dent of sword
to make your Prince to quail?
Nay make your count, though you do think
that many be as you
Of Popish mind, yet shall you find
their hearts to be full true.
And multitudes that do believe
this lore to be full right,
Are ready pressed to take her part
if you will try her might.
But better no: return in time
if you her grace do love,
And seek not justice as your right,
but do her mercy prove.
You cannot point, if field be fought
the victory at will,
What gain shall come unto your part
when each does other kill?
O simple men why should ye thus
despise the quiet state
Of this the Realm so governed
as you were in of late?
The Realms about so troubeled
and you in quiet rest:
Who shall the breakers of the same
not utterly detest?
And what if that ye should increase,
(as God forbid the same)
And Princes power with Rebels might
should run abroad by fame.
Would not the foes that now be still
then buskell to come in*
When feebled is the land of might
by broils that ye begin?
Their holiness and yours is like,
they seek but for to rain,
And for your making of their way
you shall of them be slain.
Therefore take counsel yet in time
before ye go to far.
Your Queen, your Realm, and happy stat^,
above all things prefarre.
For make account* ye shall not bring
the state to you to yield,
You shall first find the english blood
to lie in many a feelde.
The son, the father, ye shall bring
with dent of sword to stryke,
The brother shall the brother meet,
and do also the like.
In Princes cause no kith nor kin
affinity nor blood
Shall stay the subject to set out
to spend both life and good.
With conscience good, and faith full sure,
though he be slain in feelde
Yet shall he as true subject dye
and so his soul up yield.
Whereas if you in field be slain
because ye did rebel
By fact, your slaughter has the way
to Devils that are in hell.
Who for because* they did arise
against the Lord of might,
(...) you do now against his power
they lost eternal light.
The fatherless that ye shall make
and Widows in their woe
Shall pray your fee in torments great
to be for doing so.
Yea, of your own that you shall leave
shall curse you for your deeds,
When they shall feel the plague to stretch
to them, for your ill meedes.
Bethink your selves, and take advice
and speedily repent:
Accept the pardon of the Prince
when it to you is sent.
So may you save your bodies yet,
your souls and eake your good,
And stay the Devil, that hopes by you
to spill much Christian blood.
God save our Queen, and keep in peace
this Island evermore,
So shall we render unto him
eternal thanks therefore.
FINIS.

God save the Queen
