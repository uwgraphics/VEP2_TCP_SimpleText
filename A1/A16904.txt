AN EXPOSITION of the Creed, the Lords Prayer, the ten Commandments, and
the Sacraments. Catechetically Composed BY JOHN BRISTOVV, Minister of the Word
of God.

2 Timothy 1.13. Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou have heard of me,
in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

LONDON, Printed by M.F. for Samuel Man, dwelling in Paul's Churchyard, at the
sign of the Swanne, 1627.

To the Congregation or Inhabitants of Charlewood in Surry, Grace and Peace be
multiplied.
SEeing that Catechizing is very profitable, not only when it is used by the
Minister in the public assembly of the Church, but also by Parents and
Householders privately in their families; I have written this little Book, to
be some help to you, in making use of it in your families. I pray you
consider these weighty arguments and reasons, that show the necessity of
Catechizing, whereof some have relation to God, some to the persons to
Catechize, and to be Catechized.

Concerning God, first, his commandment Exodus 12.27 and 13.8.14. Deuteronomy. 6.7.
Prove. 22.6. Ephesians. 6.4.
; secondly, his example, who briefly delivered the whole Law and Gospel Exodus
20. Mat. 22.37.38.39. Genesis 3.15. and 17.7.
; thirdly, it is a mean to preserve the worship of God pure: this being
neglected after Josiah, Religion decayed very much. This is one mean to purge
out the leaven of Papistry and other errors, and that if heretics come among
us, they may be removed or reclaimed. Papists say in their Catechism of Trent,
that we have gotten ground of them by Catechizing. Let us take heed that we
lose it not again by omission thereof: fourthly, this is a mean to enlarge
Gods Kingdom, and we ought to restore back again, and to consecrate to God,
the children which we have received of him.

Concerning the persons to Catechize, first, Genesis 4. and ^8.19. Ios. 24.15.
Heb. 6.1.2. 2 Timothy 3.15.
we have the examples of Adam, Abraham, Iosuah, and the Apostles, and so was
Timothy trained up; and since in ecclesiastical histories it does appear,
Catechizing to have been used by the people of God in the time of Origin,
Socrates, etc. Secondly, Acts 20.26. Col. 3.16.
they have the charge of them that are committed to them, and must answer for
them. Moreover, they are bound to be able, and to employ their talents for the
good of others: thirdly, they shall receive joy by the success of such labor,
when God shall be glorified, the Church and Commonwealth receive benefit, and
themselves have diligent and faithful service performed: 1 Cor. 3.8.
fourthly, the grief and woe they sustain by the wickedness of inferiors,
furthered or not hindered by them.

Concerning the persons to be Catechized, first, hereby their memory may be
helped, when fundamental points are briefly set down, and they may have
thereby some means to know their duties to God and men, as they couenanted in
Baptism: secondly, hereby they may the better be fitted to receive the Lords
Supper: thirdly, their health and salvation is hereby procured: fourthly, many
miseries, yea besides the rest, damnation will be the portion of them that
remain ignorant and unreformed, for man is borne like a wild Asses colt, rude
and unruly, or like a field untilled, so as he must by teaching be fitted for
good duties. Know also, that not only children, but such as be of more years,
may receive profit by Catechizing. For some have not spent their youth so
profitably, as to be plentifully endued with knowledge as they are, which are
said to have the spirit powered upon them, Acts 2.17.
but have need of a guide, even in fundamental points, and are but babes,
Heb. 5.12.13.14
and have need of milk; yea, and it is profitable to men that are already
endued with knowledge and sound judgment, Romans 15.4. 2 Pet. 1.12. and 3.1.2.
to be stirred up and pricked forward; yea, the Apostles do write of
fundamental points (among other things) to such Churches as did know the
truth, and were full of knowledge and of pure minds. Finally, Job 28.28. Iam.
3.13.15.17 Ephesians. 4.21.22 24. Esa 11.9. Prove. 18.4. 1 John 5.18.20.
be careful so to know, as to practice, what you see to be revealed in the
Word of God, so shall you be renewed in knowledge after the image of God, and
shall grow in knowledge more and more, and be filled therewith, as God has
promised, and be in wisdom as a flowing brook, that cannot be drawn dry:
and be preserved from sin that is to death, and be like builders building
upon a rock. This let us do, and we shall give up our accounts with joy
together, and so I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is
able to build you up, and to give you inheritance among all them that be
sanctified. Acts 20.32.

fourthly, love Mat. 5.23.
.

Q. It appears we may not re^^ue the Lords Supper, if we find not ^^ese
things at all in our selves 1 Cor. 11.27.29.
, and at the wicked do not receive the body ^^d blood of Christ Ioh. 6.54.
, but only the out^ard elements: but what if we find ^^em but weak and
feeble?

he haui^^ not then taken flesh; second^^ Christ's body shall be in heaven
v^till the day of judgment Acts. 3.21.
third^^ Christ said, Do this in remembrance of me, therefore he mea^ not to
be bodily present; fourth^^ if the outward sign be taken awa^ there is no
Sacrament.

Q. What is meant by these words of our Savior, This is my Body, and this is
my Blood?

A. Math. 26.26.27.28.

shed for remission of your sins, and by your faith, you ar^ spiritually
^artakers of my Body and Blood to eter^all life.

^^condly, by the fulfilling of the prophe^^s: thirdly, by the Majesty of the
style: ^^rthly, by the efficacy: fifthly, by the ^iracles: sixthly, by the
consent: se^^nthly, by the wonderful preseruati^^ thereof: eighthly, by the
testimony of (...) holy Spirit.

Q. Seeing the fundamental and chief ^^^ngs contained in the Scriptures are
briefly ^^prised in the Creed, the ten Com^^ndements, and the Lords Prayer;
let us ^our to come to the understanding there^^^ and first to begin with the
Creed, what ^^th it contain?

A. Twelve Articles, whereof the ^^t concerns God the Father, the ^^e next,
God the Son, the eight, ^^d the holy Ghost, and the four last, (...) Church.

Q. Concerning the first Article, I be^^ue in God the Father Almighty, maker of
heaven and earth: you have already t^ me what it is to believe, or what faith
is, the definition of a special justifying fait^ which is here understood; but
are there (...) other kinds or sorts of faith which are common, and not
peculiar to the elect?

A. Yes, there are three other, nam^ly, first, an historical faith, whereby
man does know and assent to the wo^ of God: secondly, temporary, where^^ one
may know, assent unto, and ma^^ profession of the word, and sometim^ have some
confused joy, and some ^st^aining graces: third^y, faith of mi^^cles, whereby
having some extraord^nary promise or revelation, one believes some miraculous
thing shall co^^ to pass by the power of God.

kno^ledge, Matthew. 16.23. Act. 1.6. or in ^ot being able to apply the promises
to ^imselfe, without much doubting, Esa. ^2.3. secondly, what it has, and
ther^^, first, the seat thereof, an humbled ^eart, Esa. 57.15. secondly, the
effects ^f it, he acknowledges his sin to be ^ardonable, disliketh his
sins, com^ateth against unbelief, and other ^orkes of the flesh; earnestly
desires ^race, and is teachable, Matthew. 5.6. ^sal. 10.17. Revel. 21.6. also
uses the ^eanes to know more, and practices that he knows: thirdly, the
proper^^ of it is to increase, by which it diffe^eth from Popish implicit
faith.

Q. What is to be considered in a strong ^ith or believer?

A. First, he has more knowledge ^hen the weak; secondly, he applies ^^e
promises with more assurance, Romans ^.20. thirdly, all virtues and graces which
be fruits of faith, be in greater ^easure in him, yet not always in the ^^me
degrees, and never without im^erfection in this life; where even the ^^rongest
Christian has combat be^weene the flesh and the Spirit, and has the
perfection of parts, not degrees.

Q. You have already told me what G^ is, now how do you know that there (...)
such a God?

A. First, by the testimony of (...) Scripture: secondly, by the creati^^ and
government of the world Romans 1.20. Act. 14.17.
: thi^ly, by the horror of the consciences men after the committing of sinn^
fourthly, Romans 2.15.

was ordained by the w^ of God Heb. 11.3

by his providence continues things made. Psalm. 33.6. Ierem. 10.12. Ioh. 5.17.

Q. Why is the creation ascribed to the Father, being common to the whole
Trinity?

A. Because the Father is the foun^aine of the other persons, and the actions,
working from himself, and by them; also the action of the Father is most
manifest in Creating, of the Son ^n Redeeming, and of the holy Ghost ^n
Sanctifying: yet all external works ^re common to the whole Trinity, and

salvation by faith in Christ come, Genesis 3.15. and 12.3.

Q. What is the Law?

A. A perfect rule of holiness a righteousness, binding all men to obedience
of it, upon pain of damna^^on for every offense.

Q. How many Commandments a it contain?

Exodus 34.28. and 20.
A. Ten, which were at the (...) written upon two tables of stone; w^^ of the
four first written on the first ^^ble, contain the worship of God, (...) the
six last written on the second ^^ble, contain duties of charity and
ri^^teousnesse to our neighbors and (...) selves, and all the ten contain
du^^ and service to God, being performed conscience of his commandment.

Q. What learn we generally from (...) division of the Commandments?

A. That the true obedience, acc^^t^ble to the Lord is, when the Co^man^ements
of both Tables are practiced together, Ezech. 18.5.6.7.8.9. Tit. 2.2. ^ Pet.
1.5.6.7. Psalm. 119.6.101.

A. The seuering of them, doing one^y some duties to God, with omitting duties

Commandment; inward duties with inward; the greatest of the first, with the
greatest of the second; and the least of the first, with the least of the
second.

Q. What rules have you for understanding the Commandments?

A. First, when the Commandment is affirmative, it implies the negative and
when it is negative, it implies the affirmative: Romans 7.4.
secondly, the Law is spiri^tuall, as the lawgiuer is, and therefore binds
all the powers of the soul thirdly, with things commanded an^ forbidden, the
signs and outwar^^ notes are commanded and forbidden fourthly, a part is put
for the whol^ wheresoever any thing is command expressly, or by name, there all
oth^^ things of the same sort and nature; the occasions and means are
commande^ which further obedience thereunto, an^ the contrary are forbidden: yet
in t^^ second Table, that degree of moti^^ which has not obtained consent, is
be referred to the tenth Commandment; whereas such motions against any
Commandments of the first Tabl^ are to be referred to that Law, to t^^ scope
whereof they tend: fifthly: wha^soeuer is commanded or forbidden (...) be done,
or left undone by our selu^ we must procure it in others to be do^^ or left
undone, so far as our calli^^ will suffer us, Heb. 3.13. sixthly, affirm^tiue
Commandments bind at (...) times, but not to all times; negative ^nde both at
all, and to all times.

Q. Concerning the first Commande^ent, I am the Lord thy God, etc. what ^^e
these words contain?

A. First, a commandment, or duties ^ommanded; secondly, three reasons ^rging
the performance of the duties.

Q. What be the duties commanded?

A. In general, to have God for our ^od, giving him such inward worship, (...)
he has required, Pro. 23.26. Ioh. 4.^4. in particular, first, 1 Chro. 28, 9.
Hos. 6.6. Pro. 3.6. Ier. 9.23.24.
a perfect know^^dge Deuteronomy. 29.29. as that he is one God, of a nature
spiritual, infinite, holy, eternal, ^nely wise, etc. and that in this one
^ssence or being; there be three persons (...) manners of being, the Father,
Son, and holy Ghost, and that his works are ^he creation and providence, as
was ^^ewed in exposition of the Creed.

The sins forbidden, opposite to ^his knowledge of God be; first, Athe^^me,
holding there is no God, or that ^od knows not, or cares not for things of
the world, or cannot resist them, or will not reward well doing and punish
evil doing, Psalm. 14.1. Exo^ 5.2. Psalm. 10.11. Ezech. 9.9. 2 King. 1^ 32. etc.

ineffectuall knowledge separated from practice, 1 Ioh. 2.4. 1 Co^^ 13.2.

Gal. 3.11.12, 13. Romans 3.21. nor direc^ly command, yet for as much as here^^
may be comprehended a commandment to yield obedience to whatsoeu^^ God should
at any time command, and ^od gave power in Adam to do what^euer it might
please him at any time (...) command, and seeing the reasons of ^^e
Commandment, I am the Lord thy ^od which brought thee out of the and of Egypt,
etc. and the words, the lord thy God, in the third and fifth ^ommandements, may
be taken euangelically; we must here consider of euan^elicall faith, and
embrace the same, see^ng we cannot in this life have legal, ^ro. 3.5. Esa.
26.4. Ioh. 14.1. 1 Ioh. 3.23. ^he sins forbidden be, first, unbelief and
distrust, Heb. 10.38. Matthew. 6.25. ^1. Romans 10.16.21. 2 Pet. 1.8. 2 Pet. 2.^1.
secondly, presumption of faith, and ^empting God, neglecting the means ^o be
used, Matthew. 4.6.7. Deuteronomy. 29.^9.20. thirdly, hypocritical faith, ma^ing a
profession of faith void of good works, the fruits of faith, Iam. 2.14.
^ourthly, implicit faith of such as ^now not what to believe, or what the
Church of God is, or what it believes, ^ Pet. 3.15. Pro. 19.2. hereunto may be
^dded rash credulity, Ephesians. 4.14. and con^ecturall opinions, Iam. 1.6. fifthly,
temporary faith, believing only for time, Luke 8.13. sixthly, trust in o^^
wit, wealth, strength, Pro. 3.5. Psalm. 5^ seventhly, supposed merits, Luke
17.1^ or in other men, 2 Chro. 16.12. Psalm. 146 3. Esa. 31.1.3. or devils,
Deuteronomy. 18.1^ 11. or in any idols whatsoever, Psa^ 135.18. Esa. 42.17.

Psalm. 130.7. and 40. ^ 1 Pet. 1.13.

The sins forbidden in this regar^ be, first, desperation, casting away hope
when men are either besotted with present things, like the Epicures, saying
eat, drink; after death there is n^ pleasure; or when men imagine the justice
of God greater then his mercy, an^ so faint in themselves at the sight o^ their
sins: secondly, presumption o^ mercy without promise, in such as liu^
wickedly, and yet flatter themselves, Ier. 7.8. thirdly, hope in creatures, it
merits, the Popes pardons, and other fictions of men.

The fourth duty commanded, is to Deuteronomy. 6.5. Psalm. 116. ^ Matthew. 22.37. which
is a divine ^otion whereby a believer, with all ^s mind, will, affection and
strength, ^^sireth to have communion with God, (...) well pleased with him, and
indeauou^^th to please him, 1 Ioh. 4.7. Gal. 5.6. ^ant. 1.1.2.

The sins forbidden, be, first, hatred ^f God, Romans 8.7. and 1.30. Number.
10.^5. Ioh. 15.18.24.25. secondly, coun^erfeit love toward God, Esa. 66.5.
^ant. 1.6.7. thirdly, carnal love of our ^^lues, 2 Timothy 3.2. Romans 13.14.
fourthly, ^mmoderate love of the profits, plea^ures, and honors of this world,
Ephesians. ^ 5. Col. 3.5. 2 Timothy 3.4. Phil. 3.19 Gal. ^.26.

The fifth duty, is to fear God above Cant. 8.4. and 5.4. Psalm. 2.11. and
119.10. Pro. 28.14.

The sins forbidden against thi^ fear, be carnal security or hardness^ of
heart, Pro. 21.14. which is naturally in man as he is corrupted, but increase^
by drawing a false conclusion from Gods lenity and long suffering, as because
God strikes not by and by, therefore he will not punish, Eccl. 8 11. Psa.
50.21. secondly, there be diverse so^^ of evil fear; as first, a
superstitiou^ fear, where there is no cause of fear secondly, carnal fear
of men, mo^^ then of God, Matthew. 10.28. thirdly fear of idols, Ier. 10.2.
fourthly, seruil^^ and slavish fear of God, 1 Ioh. 4.18. which is a shunning
and going awa^ from God, in despair, arising from (...) knowledge and accusing
of sin, an^ feeling of Gods judgment and anger and therein it differs from
a godly fear, which arises from confidenc^ and love of God, and is exercised
i^ shunning of sin, this only in shunning of punishment, which fear is i^
the devil, Iam. 2.19.

Pet. 5.6. which is a lo^ conceit of a man's self, emptying him self of all,
giving God the whole glory ^f all the good things he has, 1 Chro. ^9.14.
herein is contained, humbling ^he heart, Matthew. 11.29. and contenta^^on with
our degree and gifts, Psalm. 31.1.2. not seeking for further places, ^^en our
gifts be fit for.

The sins here forbidden, be, first, ^resumption, Zeph. 3.11.12. secondly,
^nlawfull love of our own glory, Mat. 8.3.4. and vain glory, Phil. 2.3.
third^^, boasting of the gifts we have, 1 Cor. ^7. fourthly, counterfeit
humility, a ^ined denying of that which he secret^^ desires: the measure and
danger of ^e sin of pride is exceeding great, for ^ods glory being his
treasure, and the ^oud man breaking upon it, must ^^eds be guilty of great
robbery; and ^e danger appears in that GOD ^^th threatened to set himself
against ^m.

The seventh duty commanded, is pa^ence, Romans 15.4. which is a willing ^ng
suffering of hard and difficult ^ings for virtues sake; this should be without
perturbation in calmnesse, the ^iefe being mitigated by our expectation of Gods
aid; therefore it is calle^ a willing long-suffering, and there mu^^ also be
an abiding in that which (...) good: without this patience we cannon possess
our souls, Luke 21.19. Fai^ may be called the foundation of virtues, and
patience the roof and covering, without which, showers will fa^ into the
building and rotte it, Luke ^ 15.2 Cor. 12.10. so at length we com^ to the full
assurance of hope, Romans 8.25 35. and 5.4. The kinds of patience b^ a quiet
bearing of that which is laid v^ on us for correction, and also for tria^ The
reason of Gods dealing with us (...) afflicting us, is, first, in prospero^
things, we are as the dead sea; there mu^^ be a stirring up, or else there will
be foggishnesse in our souls; secondly that there may be a conformity
b^tweene Christ and his members; thi^^ly, Satan has his fan, ^ee must wi^
now us according to the greatness our gifts; fourthly, that we may triump^
over the devil, that he may not sa^ Does Job serve God for naught?

The sins forbidden, be, first, in d^fect, murmuring and fainting, being
overcome with too much grief, 2 Cor. 16. and seeking issue by unlawful
^eanes; secondly, in excess, rashness, ^d foole-hardinesse, running into
^edlesse danger and trouble, and insen^^lenesse, not being moved at the ^ords
chastisements, arising from not ^^garding the cause from whence, nor ^e ends
whereto afflictions tend; and may be, it works a blind grief, ^d they get
pleasures and friends to ^iue it away, and so it is without pro^^ to them, Esa.
1.3.4.

The eight duty commanded, is prai^^, Cor. 14.15. Exodus 14.14. Rom 8.26. it
^ust be made only to God, Romans 10.^4. it consists of petition and
thanks^^uing; petition contains, first, depre^tion, when we desire to have
some ^ill taken from us, for which there is ^^quired confession of sins,
Psalm. 32.^^ and 51.1. and secondly, supplication (...) have some good thing
granted: and (...) has three degrees, first, that it be gi^en, Psalm. 119.34.
secondly, that it be ^stablished, Psalm. 68.28. thirdly, that it ^e increased,
Luke 17.5. Thanksgiving is a returning to God praise for that v^ receive, the
end of all being his glor^ this he binds us to, in the same bon^ that he
binds himself to us, Psalm. 5^.15. he that receives ought, receiue^ it on
this condition, and without it is (...) usurper; in it is required, first,
confe^^on, that we have nothing, but we ha^ received it, 1 Cor. 4.7. Iam. 1.17.
s^condly, contentation, Psalm. 16.6. thirdly, annunciation and telling it
others, Psalm. 66.14. fourthly, a h^^ life, Psalm. 106.2.3. Ioh. 15.8. for t^
manner of prayer, it must be, first, continually, without weariness, Luke 1^
1. 1 These. 5.17.18. secondly, in fai^ without wavering, Iam. 1.5.6. third^ in
humbleness without insolency, L^^ 18.8, 9. Psalm. 3.2. fourthly, in iudg^ment
without impudency, asking su^^ things as are fit, with such hearts as a fit.

The sins forbidden be, first, om^sion of prayer, Psalm. 14 4. and of than
fullness, Luke 17.17.18. Esa. 5.4. ^condly, to pray carelessly, proud^^
grudgingly; to make petition or ascri^^ thanks due to God, to idols or oth^^
creatures, Hos. 2.5.8. Ier 44.17.18.

The ninth duty, is to remember Eccl. 12.1. Pro. 2.1.

The sin is to forget God, Deuteronomy. 8 1.14.19. Psalm. 50.22.

The tenth duty, is to rejoice in God, Can. 1.1.2. and ^he execution of his
will, Psalm. 16.10. ^^d 37.4 and 104.24. Phil. 4.4. Romans ^.11. Psalm. 19.10. 1
Cor. 1.31. 2 Cor. 10.7. 2 Samuel 30.6. 1 These. 1.6.

The sins herein be, first, not reioy^^ng in God, nor his Word, 1 Pet. 2.3.
^^condly, delighting in any thing else, ^rowning our joy in God, or coming
^^ere in comparison to it, and to desire ^e presence of wives and children,
^ore then the presence of God, Phil. 3.^. Ioh. 12, 43. Luke 12.19. Deuteronomy. 4.27.

The eleventh duty commanded is in^ard cheerful subjection of our wills to Gods
will, accounting it a heaven to please him whom we so love: this obedience must
be cheerful, with the whole heart, and unto every Commandment, Romans 6.17.
Exodus 23.22. Ioh. 14.15. 1 Ioh. 5.3.

The sins forbidden here be, first disobedience, the degrees whereof ar^
neglect and contempt; secondly, obedience constrained by men's laws only
thirdly, murmuring, as the Israelite^ who did not cheerfully obey God,
fourthly, counterfeit obedience for some outward cause moving us, not
fulfilling the intent of the Lawgiver when our affection is not carried afte^
God, but following our own judgment, wisdom and will, and obeying God and
man together, commandin^ contrary things.

King 19.10. Revel. 3.19.

The sins opposite hereunto be, first, ^oldnesse and luke-warmenesse, Revel.
^.15.16. secondly, ignorant zeal, Romans 10.2. thirdly, zeal pretended where it
is not.

Q. What be the three reasons by which ^he Commandment is urged?

A. From that, God is Jehovah, an ^ternall being, the beginning and end ^f all
things, performing his promises and threatenings, from none, by none, ^or none,
but all things from him, by ^im, and for him, and therefore we ^ust have no
other Gods before him, Exodus 3.14. Reu. 1.8. Esa. 44.24. Exodus ^.3. Deuteronomy. 28.58.

Q. What learn we from this title Ieho^ah, or Lord?

A. First, that he is of absolute au^hority, and therefore his will is law:
^one can call him to a reason of his do^^gs, so that we must obey where he
^ommandeth, although we see no rea^^n of the thing commanded: we must ^eleeue
if he speak, although we see ^ot how it should be performed, for he (...)
Lord. Secondly, all our actions ^^ught to be directed to him as their end.
Thirdly, there is no power t^ withstand him, no craft to deceive hi^ none to
outliue him, therefore no w^ to escape him when we have offende^ but to fall at
his feet, in who^e han^ we are for life or death. Fourthly, w^ ought to
persevere, we should confor^ our selves in every virtue to some ^tribute of
God, as in knowledge to h^ wisdom, in belief to his truth, in o^ integrity
to his vbiquity, in our per^uerance to his eternity.

Q What is the second reason inforc^ the obedience to this Commandment?

A. It is in these words, thy God, strong God in covenant with the wherein must
be observed, the force the rela^ion, if I be thy God, thou m^ be my people, and
set up to thy self: other God.

Q. How does he prove himself to (...) their God?

A. By a notable and memorable (...) of power and goodness which he (...) for
them; their deliverance from ^gypt, whereby he pledged to them (...) favor,
and proved his power.

Q. How can this be a reason to us, s^^g we tasted not of that benefit?

A. God has delivered us from a ^reater bondage of sin and the de^ill; and
how much more the sting of ^onscience, sin, death, hell, and the ^euill,
passed Pharaoh and all his taske-^asters, torments without number pass ^^e
tale of brick, so much must the re^embrance of our d^liuerance pass ^heirs to
move us to obey.

Q. What is the third reason?

A. It may be gathered from the al^nowledge of God in these words, Before me;
thus, thou must not give thine ^^ffections to any other, nor set up another but
me; for I am the Lord thy God, and able to punish, and it is in my sight,
therefore thou shall have me for thy God.

Q. What may we learn out of these ^ords, Before me?

A. It teaches us, that the sins which are done in this Commande^ent, come
only to the sight of God, Esa. 45 7. 1 Ioh. 3.20. the inward man ^eing bound
by it, and requires truth ^n the inward parts, integrity is the virtue
commanded.

Q. What is forbidden?

A. Hollow hypocrisy, unsoundness of heart, when the outward man goes
without the inward, as the Pharisee^ or that so holds one religion, as tha^
he is ready to follow another.

Q. Concerning the second Command^ment, Thou shall not make to thy self a^
graven Image, etc. what is generally commanded herein?

A. The true outward worship of the true God, according as is prescribed i^ the
word written, without adding (...) detracting, Deuteronomy. 12.32.

Q. How has this Commandment b^ place next the first?

A. There follows a profession (...) that God whom we have chosen, which
consists in public worship; so the which commands the profession (...) him
in public worship, which himse^^ has commanded, follows the former,
commanding us to choose him.

Q. What may more particularly be o^serued in the second Commandment?

A. First, the precept it self; secon^ly, reasons urging the performance o^
the Commandment.

Q. What particular duties be comman^ed, and sins forbidden in the second
Commandment?

A. First, First sort of duties commanded, containing seven particulars.
to worship God by such means, and after such manner as he ^ath appointed, as
namely, these seven.

First, to be content with the Scrip^ures for our direction in all things,
Deuteronomy. 4.2. Esa. 8.20. 2 Timothy 3.16.17.

The sin forbidden here is, to set before us for our direction, for the rule
of our faith and obedience, any other word written or unwritten, besides the
^nspired Books of Scriptures; as first, ^he Books called Apocrypha, which
although they may be read as many other Books of godly men, yet we may not
build our faith, upon them: secondly, forged Books, as the Gospel of Thomas,
Barnabas, and Nicodemus: thirdly, Papists unwritten traditions, Matthew. 15.9.
fourthly, loathing the simplicity of serving God, that the Word prescribes,
and admiring will worship, Col. 2.18.23. 1 Samuel 15.11.12 etc. and all good
intentions not grounded on the Word, may be referred hither, 2 Samuel 6.6. Ioh.
16.2.

Heb. 5.4. Romans 10.15.17. Ephesians. 4.11. to Read and Preach the Word, Mal. 2.7. 1
Ti^ 3.2. 2 Timothy 4.2. Act. 13.14. and 15.21 Neh. 8.8. and people ought to hear
the Word Read and Preached, 1 These. 5.2^ Ioh. 8.47. Esa. 2.3. Psalm. 122.1.

The sin forbidden, is a false Ministry, not appointed of God, as Pope^
Cardinals, Priests to offer properly a r^ all sacrifice propitiatory for the
quick and dead, in the M^sse, Math. 15.1^ and hereunto may be added, a dumb^
Ministry, Neh. 8.8. 1 Timothy 3.2. Esa. 56 10. Hos. 4.6. Ier. 23.31.32. Matthew.
15.14. moreover, neglect of hearing the Word preached, Heb. 10.25.

Psa^ 65.1.2. Esa. 56.7. which that it may b^ used aright, first, it is to be
directed (...) the true God only, Psalm. 50.15. secondly, in the mediation of
Christ alone, Col 3.17. Ioh. 16.23.27. 1 Timothy 2.5. other things belonging to
prayer, may be noted on the third Commandment.

The sins are, first, neglect of prayer, Psalm. 14 4. secondly, abuse thereof,
first, when it is directed to Angels or Saints, Romans 10.14. Esaias 63.16. Mal.
1.11. with 1 Timothy 2.8. secondly, when men substitute other Mediators as S.
Mary, S. Peter etc. Thirdly, when people pray privately in public, Yet
condemn I nor a short ciaculation at entrance, (...) ^od assist me, God
sanctify me now to these holy duties, or the like.
and join not with ^he assembly in prayer, or hearing the word, Eccl. 5.1. 1
Cor. 14.40. Fourthly, ^o leave praying at the coming in of any to make a leg
or to place him. Fifthly, to pray with lips without touch of heart, Es. 29 13.
Sixthly, to pray on^y with the heart never using the voice when conveniently we
might, Hos. 14.2.

A fourth duty commanded, is to administer Mat. 28.19. and 26.^6, 27, 28.
Sacraments belong to the Gospel properly in regard of signification and end of
institution, but as parts of Gods outward worship commanded by him, and as all
nations by the light of nature observe some external rites in their worship,
they are in a general manner reduced to the second Commandment.

The sins forbidden in this regard be first, to neglect the sacraments when w^
might be partakers thereof, Numb. 9.13 Secondly, to have more sacrament then the
Lord has given to hi^ Church; as those five of the Papist^ Confirmation,
Penance, Matrimony Orders, and extreme unction. Thirdly to take away the wine
in the Lords supper from the people. Fourthly, hereunto may be added Magic,
worshipping the Devil by charms and otherwise, wherein they have as it were
devilish sacraments, and many way^ break this Commandment, Deuteronomy. 1^ 10.11. 1 Samuel 28.11, 12, 13, 14. Esa. 8.19. and 65.4. Ezekiel. 21.21.

Matthew. 28.15 16, 17, 18. 1 Cor. 5.4. 2 Cor. 2.6.

The sins in this respect be, first, t^ neglect this duty, and to suffer
notorious and gross offenders to live without discipline, and to come to the
sa^^ament, without testifying repentance. ^econdly, to abuse this ordinance of
^od by excommunicating men for well ^oing; John 6.2. and for trifles.

Sixthly, Swearing by the true God may Deuteronomy. 6.3. An oath is a religious and
neces^ary confirmation of things by calling upon God to be a witness of truth,
and ^euenger of falsehood, first, in assertion, ^econdly in promise, Esaias 29.28.
Heb. 6.16. Ruth 1.17. Heb. 3.11. 2 Cor. 1.23.

The sins and sinful abuse of an ^ath as it is taken by the true God, is
against the third Commandment; but some sins in swearing may be considered
of here, as first by naming parts of God as if he were a man, as heart, ^oule,
sides, feet, nails, body. Secondly, by his pity, mercy, passion, blood,
wounds, life, death, Totus Christus adorandus est, et humanitas Christi in
composite.
etc. if people hereby understand Christ's humanity, either they as much as in
them lies tear his precious body: or by superstitious ignorance deify the
members of Christ, for howsoever in some cases it may be lawful to worship
Christ man, yet not his humanity, or parts of his body so considered as they
do. Thirdly, heathenish oaths as by Jupiter, etc. Fourthly, Papisticall
oaths, by Angels, and Saints, S. Mary, S George, the Mass, Ro^d, etc. Is.
5.7. Amos 8.14. Fifthly, by other creatures as fire, light, silver, faith,
troth, honesty, etc. Sixthly, ridiculous nicknamed oahes, as bodikin, lakin,
cock, fey, fack, fagges, etc. as if God regarded the pronunciation and outward
found more then the oath it self, or loved to be mocked in his worship.

Pet. 3.15. or by departing with our goods for the defense and maintenance
thereof, is commanded of God, and may be referred to this Precept.

The sin is, first, to give our bodily presence to idolatry, our minds being
against it; secondly, to see it and be silent; thirdly, to confess the truth,
but with such as be like our selves, before others to be ashamed of it, or to
confess it, but not defend it, or to do it ^hiftingly, not plainly, Mark.
8.38. Romans ^0.10. Matthew. 10.32. Thus much of ^he first sort of things commanded.

Secondly, there is commanded fit Neh. 8.6. lifting up the ^ies, and hands,
Psalm. 141.2. and 121.1. ^ohn 17.1. they that with their eyes loo^ed upon Idols
in a superstitious man^er, are accused of idolatry. Ezekiel. Gestures should be
decent, and such as ^ay express the humility and deuoti^n of our mind, and in
the public ser^ice of God, it is good to follow the ^audable fashion and
custom of that ^articular Church where we live.

The sin is, first, to neglect reverent gestures, as when in prayer men stare
on ^uery one that comes in, and when ^ee give such gestures to men out of
^eason, as in the time of preaching and ^rayer they do, that leave prayer and
^reaching and all to make a leg when their landlord comes in. Secondly, ^o
give religious adoration to creatures, ^s to Angels and Saints departed, Rev.
19.10. Acts 10. Though civil wo^ship or reverence is to be yielded (...) such
as be our superiors, yet not re^^gious, as if they knew our hearts, (...) were
every where present, Almighty, (...) the like. And it is sin to adore relique^
as the Cross of Christ, the sepulche^ of dead men, etc. and it is sin to
ado^^ the bread in the Sacrament, for Chr^^ is no otherwise present therein
then the water at Baptism. So it is a sin kiss an idol showing some
approbatio^ of the idol thereby, Hos. 13.2.

Although the church of England retain the name of saints dais, yet without
idolatry, the dais being dedicated to the honor of God.
according to ord^^ and tending to edification, 1 Cor. 1^ 13. and 14.26.40.

The sin is, when ceremonies be r^diculous, unprofitable, superstitious, (...)
made parts of Gods worship. And he is forbidden building of altars, or temples,
and consecrating of days to Saint or Angels, Exodus 22.20. also erecti^^
altars, burning incense, and lighting t^pers to relics, 2 King. 18.4.

Fourthly, we are commanded to she Deuteronomy. 7.3.4. and 11.16. and 12.13.30. ^^d
Magistrates, and Ministers, and all ^^cording to their callings should be
^alous to root out and abolish superstiti^^s worship, Exodus 23.24. Deuteronomy. 7.25,
^. and 12.1, 2, 3.

The sin is to retain relics and ^onuments of Idolatry. Esa. 30.22. ^xod.
23.13.

Fifthly, helps and furtherances to 1. Fast^^^
religious fast is a voluntary abstine^ce ^m all food, and other comforts and
lights, for a convenient time, not ^eiudiciall to health, Joel 2.12.17. Matt.
5.15, 16. They who cannot abstain so long from all meat, should eat for
quantity very little, and for quality, coorse or mean food.
that our humilia^on and prayer may be furthered. The ^^e of fasting ordinarily
should last for ^e day, at the least until the evening, ^v. 23.32. Judge.
20.26. The causes of ^ting be, first, if we have fallen into ^y grievous
sin, 1 Samuel 7.6. second^en some among us have so fallen, 1 ^^r. 5.2, thirdly,
when judgment is vp^^ us, or is imminent hanging over our ^ad, Judge. 20.26. 2
Chro. 20.2. fourth^^ for judgment upon others, 2 Samuel, 12 ^. fifthly, when we
stand in need of some special benefit, Acts 10. or for success of the
Gospel, Acts 13.3. although all prayer require full ^ffection, yet in the time
of a fast it should be extraordinary, and special in zeal, strength and
continuance; therefore bring we down the body, that the spirit may be carried
up.

Esa. 22.12. etc.
The sins forbidden be, first, no^ fasting when there is occasion. Secondly,
fasting is abused: First, when there i^ only outward abstinence, without
inward humiliation and affection, Esaias 58. Sec^ndly, to abstain only from
flesh. Thirdly, to fast unseasonably without respect of occasions, as when God
has called us to rejoicing. Fourthly, to fast without extraordinary prayer.
Fifthly, not to keep the day of fasting in the nature of a Sabbath, Lev. 23.30.
Sixthly, to keep a fast to Saints Seventhly, to think to merit by fasting.

Numb. 30.2. Deuteronomy. 2^.21. Psalm. 22.25. 2 King^ 23.3. A vow is a promise made to
God of things lawful and possible. There be three so^ts mentioned in the
Scripture, first, of ceremonial duties which be now abolished; secondly, a
promise of moral obedience, which concerns us, Psalm. 119, 106. 1 Pet. 3.21.
thirdly, a promise of some bodily work and outward duty; as to fast, to give
such or such alms; to abstain from some meats and drinks, and to use or not
use other indifferent things, 1 Timothy 4.8. this last may be lawful for us to
make and keep, some cautions observed, as may be showed further upon the third
Commandment.

The sins be, first to neglect this help, and not to make vows with care
of keeping them, secondly, to make vows to creatures, as to Saints, as the
Papists do.

A third help to Gods worship, Sam. 10.5. and 19.20. 2 King. 4.38. the sin
is, to take away schools of learning, as Julian the Apostate did; and
secondly, when men without gifts run into the Ministry, before they be sent,
1 Kin. 13.33.

Concerning maintenance, God has commanded the Ministers of the Word should
competently be provided for, Deuteronomy. 12.19. 1 Timothy 5.17. Gal. 6.6.7. The sin
is, sacrilegious taking away such things as belong to the maintenance of the
Ministry, Mal. 3.8. Romans 2.22.

Prou. 13.20. Psalm. 16.3. and 119.63.

The sin forbidden in this respect, is society with idolaters in religion, 1
Cor. 10.20.21.22. and too familiar in civil affairs, Mal. 2.11. 2 Chro. 19.2.
and selling things, which the seller knows shall be superstitiously employed;
and trial of suits before idolaters, when we deal with our brethren, and
other decision may be had, 1 Cor. 6.6.

Q. What sins be forbidden more generally against the performance of Gods
worship, required in the second Commandment?

A. First, making of Images of God, Deuteronomy. 4, 15.16. Esa. 40.18. Romans 1.25.
secondly, images of creatures religiously used, Exodus 8.10. yet images and
pictures of creatures ma^^ be made for civil use, Matthew. 22.20. profitable
stories being drawn, the nature of birds and beasts may more be known, and
cities and countries. And the science of casting, caruing, and painting, is
reckoned among the gifts of God, Exodus 31.3.

Object. But Images are laymens books, and teach devotion, and therefore may
be religiously used.

A. They are teachers of vanity, and their doctrine is lies, Hab. 2.18. Ierem.
10.8.

Object. The Israelites had Cherubines in Salomons Temple.

A. They had an express commandment, we an express inhibition; and they were
signs of spiritual things, which being come, the use is ended; also they were
out of the sight of the people, the Papists be not so.

Q. Why has the Lord made choice of ^he word Image to include so many things,
^s it appears are forbidden in this Law?

A. Because it was from the begin^ing almost an invention, wherein man did
please himself for Gods worship; therefore under that he condemns all other
inventions.

Q. What be the reasons persuading our obedience to the second Commandment?

A. First, one is drawn from Gods jealousy, a metaphorical speech drawn from
wedlock; he is the husband of his Church: the second is drawn from his
justice, punishing to the fourth generation, them that hate him; the third is
from his mercy, reserving mercy for thousands that love him, and show it by
keeping his Commandments.

Q. Concerning the third Commandment, Thou shall not take the name, etc. what
is meant by taking his name in vain?

A. Name signifies, first, the titles and attributes of God; secondly,
religion; thirdly, the works of God: by all which God is known; and, In
vain, signifies for no cause, or upon a light and fond occasion.

Q. What may be observed in the word^ of the Commandment?

A. First, a precept; secondly, a reason enforcing obedience thereunto.

Q. What is commanded in general?

A. That in all our life we set forth his glory, not diminishing any thing of
honor due to him.

Q. Seeing that God is glorified in the right use, first, of his titles;
secondly, of the exercises of religion, and thirdly, of his works; show me
first what things are required to the glorifying of God jointly in all these
together, and then in every of the particulars.

A. First, we are commanded to know

Ignorance is forbidden, a sin whereby the devil greatly prevails in men
to Gods dishonor, and abuse of his name.

Secondly, here is commanded the Deuteronomy. 49. and 6.10. Col. 3.16.

The sin forbidden is, first, a loathing and shunning of such speech as is
had of God; secondly, the auouching or spreading abroad of some false doctrine,
concerning God, his will, or works, Ier. 14.



The sin forbidden, is contempt of God, and omitting of his praise, not to
take knowledge of the wisdom, and goodness, and power which shines in his
works, and to deride his work, or manner of working, or to extenuate the
excellency of it, or to obscure his gifts in our neighbor, and to dispraise
meats at table, 1 Cor. 10.31. Romans 1.19.20. secondly, contumely or blasphemy,
which is to speak of God such things as are contrary to his nature, properties
and will, either through ignorance or hatred of the truth, and God himself, 1 Timothy 1.13. thirdly, to banne and curse, either our selves or others, speaking
impious things, as if God were the executioner, to revenge our quarrel, Romans
12.14.

The fourth thing commanded, is

Q. To come to the particular things signified by the name of God, and the
things commanded and forbidden in every of them: how is God to be glorified by
the right use of his titles and attributes, as God, Lord, Almighty, Infinite,
etc?

A. We must reverently in heart think, First, concerning the titles of God.
and with tongue confess and speak of God and his titles, and live holily in
our profession, as becomes them that deal with Gods attributes, having a
feeling affection of the glory of God, that shines in them, answerable to the
excellency, holiness, and comfortablenesse of them, Zach. 2.3. 2 Chro.
24.20.21.22. Deuter. 28.58. Romans 5.9.

The sin is a careless taking up of them without any preparation of heart,
or inward feeling and reverence, without regard of the ends, for every trifle;
as first, in Plays and sports on Stages; secondly, with children, in telling
of jests, tales and stories; thirdly, in uttering any troubled affection;
fourthly, in light and vain swearing; fifthly, in using them about wicked
matters, as Witches, Sorce^ers, and Coniurers do; sixthly, in common
salutations of courtesy, without inward reverence, or feeling; seventhly, in
cursing our selves or others, as Carders and Dicers, cursing the Cards and
Dice, their luck or fortune, which is a crying out upon God, that disposes
all things by his providence; eighthly, living vnholily in the profession of
religion, Romans 2.24.

Secondly, Concerning the exercises of religion. First, the Word. 1 Pet. 2.1.2
Luke 8.13.14.
The second thing commanded, is the right use of the exercises of Religion, as
the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Oath, and Vows; first, for the glorifying of God
in the ^ight use of his Word; first, before we hear it, we must avoid
excess in diet, pride, curiosity, hypocrisy, worldly care and preiudicated
opinions; and we must meditate of Gods ordinance in the ministry of the word
to beget grace, and to increase it in us; and we must pray for the Minister,
Col. 4.3. and for our selves, Psalm 119.18. secondly in the action of hearing,
we must attend with reverence, Esa. 66.2. ^lence, Job 29.9. faith, Heb. 4.2.
and ^ollow it with our affections feelingly, according to the matter of it, and
not de^art before the end, Ezekiel. 46.10. third^y, after we have heard it, we
must me^itate of it, Psalm. 1.2. and search our ^elues, and labor to find the
power of (...) in us, conferring of it, and practicing (...), that so we may
give glory to God in that experience, Luke 8.15. Iam. 1.22.

The sins forbidden be, first, to ob^erue the ordinance in the outward man
without the inward; to hear it without fear, care, or conscience, not
stri^ing to feel the power of it; secondly, ^n some Gentlemen's houses, there
is a ^inne, to content themselves with common service (as it is called) with
the ^eglect of the Word Preached, and that upon the Sabbath day; thirdly, ^here
is this sin in the speeches of ignorant men, saying, they had as lieue ^eare
an Epistle or Gospel read, as a Sermon preached; fourthly, there is a sin in
the dumb Minister and people, who ^eade and hear it read, with this purpose
to beget faith ordinarily, whereas God has reserved that ordinarily t^ the use
of the preaching of it, not t^ bare reading; fifthly, to make jests of the
Scripture phrase; sixthly, to make char^^ of the sentences of it, as some do,
wi^ Ps. 50.8. with a key set in a book to fi^^ out a thief: hereunto may be
adde^ other witchcraft and enchantment: ^^uenthly, in Stage-plaies, Interlude
and Pageants, Pro. 13.13. Esa. 66.2.

2 The Sacraments.
Secondly, we must glorify God^ the right use of the Sacraments: conc^^ning
Baptism, first, in our own use it, by meditating of the end of it, seek out
and find in our selves, the we are one with God and Christ by (...) Spirit,
that our sins be not only f^^ given, but even killed in the root. W^
strangers in this world, and reioyci^ in our privileges of the heavenly ci^^
whereinto we are incorporated. W^ must show in our lives, that we are ^^deed
baptized with the holy Gho^^ Romans 6.2.3. and so glorify God w^ praise to him
for that ordinance.

The sins forbidden be, first, not feel this power and comfort of it, (...)
to labor to feel it in time of temp^^tion; secondly, not to call to mind the
^romises and vows made in baptism, ^or indeauouring to keep them, never ^o
regard what was there done.

Secondly, concerning our carriage ^f our selves in the baptising of others,
(...) as we take not Gods name in vain: ^^at must be considered of people, as
^^ey are Parents of children, or only ^embers of the Church; Parents must ^rst
prepare themselves before, by re^embring the merciful covenant of ^od to them
and their seed, and by ex^erience in themselves to conceive ^ope for the
child: secondly, with all ^onuenient speed that may be accor^ng to the
assembly of the congrega^^on desire that Sacrament, calling to ^inde the
ordinance of God, which is ^ot only, that the child shall be ^^ought into
the covenant of grace, ^^t there it must also be sealed up in ^e flesh, Genes.
17.10.11.12. Exodus ^ 24.

The sin forbidden is, without any ^ought of the covenant, to be led on
(...) the cords of custom, not giving ^ankes to God for that mercy, nor
praying for the fruit of that Sacramen^ to the child: secondly, not to
instru^^ the child being come to discretion, i^ the doctrine of the covenant,
and the use of the Sacrament, nor to labor in (...) the feeling of the power
and use of the ordinance of God for faith and sancti^^cation: thirdly, to
defer the time (...) receiving that Sacrament, upon unnecessary occasions and
trifling excuses.

The rest of the assembly, and members of the Church, ought with knowledge of
Gods covenant, and joy of (...) member to be added, to address themselves unto
the work, praying earne^^ly with the Minister, striving also (...) feel the
force of it in themselves, ci^^ling to mind the solemn vow th^^ have made
therein; so afterward stirri^^ up themselves to a communicating (...) gifts and
privileges with the par^^ received, and one with another, L^^^. 1.59. Ephesians.
4.1.7.

The sin is, to run out from (...) congregation before the Sacrament (...)
administered, without necessary occ^^on; or staying, to busy our selves w^^
other matters, not praying with t^^ Minister, not calling to mind our own ^ow,
and promise made in it, not to ^^iue to be comforted by it, but to e^^eeme it
as a common thing.

Concerning the Lords Supper, that ^ee may glorify God in the right use
^ereof; first, we must meditate of the and thereof, in the ordinance of God, to
^onfirme our faith, and cheerfully to ^emember Gods goodness to us; se^ondly,
we must examine our selves of ^ur fitness for the use thereof, in know^edge,
lest our sacrifice be blind, in re^entance, lest it be lame, in faith and
^^ue, lest we want our wedding gar^ent, 1 Cor. 11.28.

The sin is, to come ignorantly, in ^nbeliefe, malice, and impenitency: yea
^o neglect the renewing of our repen^ance, 1 Cor. 11.29.30.31.

Thirdly, 3 Prayer.
prayer is to be made to God ^n a right manner, for which cause, first, ^e must
prepare our selves before pray^r, by knowledge of Gods commandment, and of the
things asked, that ^hey be according to Gods will, 1 Ioh. ^.14.15. and by true
repentance, Esa. ^.15. Psalm. 66.18. and by love to men. Mark. 11.25. and
emptying our heart of worldly matters, that we may reverently lift them up to
God; secondly, i^ the action of prayer, we must have (...) sense and feeling
of our wants, Psalm. 63.1. and confidence to be heard, grounded upon Gods
promises through Christ, Mark. 11.24. Ioh. 16.23. an^ feruency, Iam. 5.^6. Romans
15.30. an^ perseverance, Ephesians. 6.1^ thirdly, afte^ prayer, we must rest and
wait upon God by faith, and labor in the use (...) the means for the
obtaining of th^^ which we prayed for.

The sins be, first, when prayer i^ made in ignorance of the command^ment and
will of God, Romans 10.14. an^ in an unknown tongue, 1 Cor. 14. secondly, when
people pray by numbe^ so many prayers, without considering their particular
wants, Matthew. 6. thirdly, when such as pray, have no care to leave their
sins, Esa. 1.15. fourthly, to pray waueringly without confidence. Iam. 1.5.6.

4 Oath.
Fourthly, we are commanded to glorify God by the right taking of an oath by
preparing our selves to it, by consideration of the Lord, to whose iudge^ent we
commit our selves in the oath, ^o stir up our selves to swear in truth, ^^st
we forswear, in justice, lest we com^it iniquity, in judgment, lest we ^eare
lightly and rashly, Ier. 4.1. Esa. 8.1. so worshipping God in it, we rest (...)
the means for ending the strife.

The sins be, first, to swear with a ^lse heart deceitfully, false things,
and ^hen a man performs not that which ^n his own accord he swear, Matthew.
5.3. secondly, to swear unjustly, to do ^at which is evil, as Act. 23.
third^, with a vain mind upon every oc^sion, without due consideration, not
(...) judgment, rashly, Eccl. 9.2.

Fifthly, vows must be used aright, 5 Vows:
^^d therefore must be lawfully made ^d kept; first, the matter of them must
^^e agreeable to Gods will and Word; ^^condly, the end of them must be to
^stifie thankfulness to God for bene^s received, or to preserve repentance
and obedience by setting a Tutor over ^he will to keep it in promised
obedi^nce; thirdly, they must be made with ^onsent of superiors, if we be
under government, Numb. 30. fourthly, the must be po^sible; fifthly, agreeable
(...) the calling of him that makes the^ generally as a Christian, or
particul^^ sixthly, they must be made with delib^ration, not rashly; seventhly,
they m^^ stand with christian liberty; lastly, la^full vows must be kept,
Eccl. 5.

The sins be, first, to make su^ vows about indifferent things, to b^ parts
of Gods worship, when as they (...) but stays and proppes to the worsh^
secondly, to account them meritorio^ thirdly, to make them of such things be
against the express word of God, the Papists vow of continency, vo^tary
poverty, and monastical life, A^ 20.35. 1 Cor. 7.9.23. 2 These. 3.10.1^ 12.
fourthly, foolish vows, rashly (...) unadvisedly made, in ignorance (...)
lightness; fifthly, breaking of law^ vows, Psalm. 78. Exodus 9.28.34. (...)
keeping vows made against the w^ of God.

Thirdly, concerning the works of God.
Thirdly, we are commanded to g^rifie God in the right use of his wor^^ of
creation and providence, with g^^ reverence and found feeling of t^^ glory of
God shining in them: first, to stir up our minds to search them out
thoroughly, and the glory of God which any way may be found in them, Psalm.
104.24.34. and 64.9.10. and 145.10.12. secondly, in the naming of them, to
speak with reverence, as of such excellent things, Psalm. 64.9.10. Luke
2.18.19. Psalm. 8.1. thirdly, to imitate that in the creature, which we may
follow, Matthew. 6.26.28. Pro. 6.6. and to avoid what we should shun, Psalm.
32.9. fourthly, to teach the works of God to our posterity, that of the nature
and quality of every work, they may take ^ruit and profit of increase unto
holiness, Psalm. 78.7.10.11. Deuteronomy. 4.9. fifthly, to sanctify the use of them by
the Word and Prayer, 1 Timothy 4.5. sixthly, in ^he prosperity of our selves and
others, to be thankful, Psalm. 124.6. and 66.16. Romans 2.4. seventhly, in
adversity ^o acknowledge Gods justice, and to be humble, Job 1.21. Dan. 9.
Psalm. 58.11.12. eighthly, concerning lots, we ought with due meditation of Gods
providence, justice and wisdom, by prayer, ^o prepare our selves, and with
faith, wait for the immediate disposition of the lot by the Lord, to end some
great matter in doubt, r^sting in the event with contentation and quietness,
Pro. 18.18. and 16.33. Act. 1.23.

The sins be, first, not regarding the works of God, not seeking out the
excellency of them, and being silent in our knowledge of them: secondly,
superstition, which is a wrong opinion conceived of the works of Gods
providence: the reason whereof can neither be dr^wne from the word of God, nor
out of the whole course of nature, as to surmize that beasts may be tamed by
verses, prayers, or the like; that it is unlucky to have a Hare cross his way,
and superstitiously to consecrate water, as in Papists holy water: thirdly, to
use the creatures without sanctifying them by the Word and Pray^r, and to be
unthankful for benefits: fou^thly, to abuse the creatures by drunkenness or
uncleanness: fifthly, not to be humbled at Gods judgments, Esa. 1.5. Ier. 5.3.
sixthly, to abuse the creatures by palmestry, by inspection of the hand, and the
lines, crosses, and angles of it, to tell fortunes: seventhly, by physiognomy
or view of men's faces, to guess at, or ^ell fortunes: eighthly, from the
sta^^es by judicial astrology, to cast natiuities, ^oretell wars, the death
of great men, ^amine, etc. ninthly, concerning lots, ^o rush upon them rashly,
without me^itation and prayer, and to use them ^or trifles, when controversies
may o^herwise be ended; and to make gain ^f a lot, using subtilty to deceive;
and ^o repine, and not r^st in the end of the ^ontrouersie, decided by lot,
lawfully ^sed; and by casting of dice, and looking ^^to a book to tell
fortunes.

Q. What is the reason whereby the third ^ommandement is urged?

A. By a severe threatening, that God ^ill not hold them guiltless, but
con^emne them to eternal destruction, ^^at take his name in vain, without
^ecessity, without glory to him, or pro^^ to men.

Q. Concerning the fourth Commande^ent, Remember that thou keep holy, etc.
that is the general scope of the same?

A. To appoint when God is especi^ly to be worshipped.

Q. What does this word, Remember, import, which is set before this
Commandment, and not before the rest?

A. First, that God will in no wis^ bear the forgetting and neglect of the
Commandment, because this contains in some sort all the worship commanded in
the former, being the special time set apart for the performing o^ it
specially and publicly; and therefore he obiecteth to the Israelites, the
transgression of this Commandment when he means to signify the breac^ of
the whole Law: secondly, it m^^ teach us, there is required a special
pr^paration to the obedience of this Commandment; having it so in mind, tha^
we cast all our businesses, so as we man ever mind, that they shall not call
v^ away from the sanctifying of this da^ and therefore this word, Remember,
(...) specially directed to the gouerno^^ that have others within their charg^
under their authority: thirdly, it m^^ teach us to bring a religious mind^
without which, whatsoever outwa^^ work we do, is not accepted; and (...) this
we must have the more care, con^^dering our pronenesse by nature to forget the
sanctifying of this day.

Q What is the meaning of this word Sanctify, or what is it to keep the
Sabbath day holy?

A. To set apart, or separate a thing from a common and ordinary, to a holy
^se: so the Lord sanctifies his people, ^eparating them from the common do^age
of the world, to be a peculiar people to himself, Leuit. 27.28.14.16. so ^he
Priests, Exodus 29.1. so the Sabbath, when we separate our thoughts, words,
works, senses and time, from a com^on use, to a holy and divine.

Q. Whether is it a Commandment, or (...) permission, when God says, Six
days ^hou shall labor?

A. The restraint of his labor about ^he work he has to do, unto the six
^aies, is a Commandment, limiting ^he time of his labor to them, that he
^reake not in upon the Sabbath. But ^or laboring the whole six days, if by
^is loytering and negligence he leave ^ot his work, to fall upon the Sabbath,
(...) take it not to be a Commandment, ^ut a permission; so as the Church may
separate some of the six days, either to solemn re^oycing, or humiliation.

Q. What is the meaning of this, Within thy gate?

A. Figuratively it is to be taken for jurisdiction or authority; whatsoever we
have to the uttermost bounds of it.

Q. What does it teach us?

A. That they which have the government of others, are bound to see the
Sabbath kept, not only in the^ own persons, but in the rest that belong to
them, and if they do not sta^ the profaning of the Sabbath by the^ authority;
their breaches of the Sabba^^ shall be laid upon them to answer for Neh. 13.

Q. Does this law still bind us, or is (...) abrogated, because the Apostle
says, let (...) man condemn you in a Sabbath?

A. The Apostle speaks of the c^moniall Sabbath, as the seventh year and
other festival days, which are ^brogared. Moreover, the seventh da^ from the
c^eation of it, and the obs^uing it with the set ceremonies, ( Nu^ 28.9.10.) is
taken away, Act. 20.^ 1 Cor. 16.1. Reu. 1.10. Ours for the resurrection of
Christ, is called the Lords day. Moreoue^, the Sabbath in the old Testament,
was a type and figure of regeneration, Ezekiel. 20.12. Exodus 31.15. and of the
everlasting rest of the Kingdom of heaven, Heb. 4.8.9. in this respect labors
are not simply and for themselves forbidden, now as they were then, but as they
hinder our spiritual exercise and sanctifying of the Sabbath or Lords day,
either in public or private, but as they help us in these, they are lawful;
but the moral observing of the Sabbath, is perpetual, and binds us, as well
as the Jews, as all the other of the ^enne Commandments also do.

Q. How may this Commandment be divided?

A. First, into the Commandment it self: secondly, reasons enforcing
obedience to it.

Q. What are the duties commanded, and sins forbidden?

A. First, there is commanded to rest; secondly, to perform holy duties.

First, 1 To rest.
to rest from our labors upon that day, the better to attend upon the other
duties commanded; as to rest from the works and labors of our honest and
lawful callings, Leuit. 23.3. Exodus 34.21. and 31.5. as the husbandmans
plowing, sowing, reaping, binding, turning, or bringing home his corn; also
from faires, chafferings, bargains, Neh. 13.15.16.17.19. and from ordinary and
unnecessary iournies, Exodus 16.29. yet we must know, that in case of necessity
and charity, a man may do some of these works, that be servile, and not
break the Sabbath, Mat. 12.1.5.11. Luke 14.5. Mark. 2.27. first, iournies to
the Prophets, and places appointed for Gods service, are lawful on this day, 2
King. 4.23. Psalm. 84.7. secondly, to procure some special and necessary good
to others; so Midwiues and Physicians may travel to women, and them that be
sick, and so to help a beast out of a pit, Luke 14.15. to give them meat and
water, and to provide meat and drink, Matthew. 12.1. but these must be done,
not as worke^ of our calling simply, but as works of charity: we must know
also, that wanton Dancings, Drinkings, Church-ales, Stage-plaies, great feasts
in pampering the flesh, hinder the performance of the duties of the Sabbath,
more then ordinary labor. Concerning solemn and sumptuous feasts, such as are
made at marriages, or admitting of men into their civil offices, although they
be lawful in themselves, yet not on the Sabbath day, being dangerous and
unfit to be used, both because they detain many from the assemblies, and
hinder almost all the private exercises and duties of the Sabbath. In this
case, David's example is worthy of consideration, 1 Chro. 11.18.19. so we may
say of the meats in those pompous prepa^ations, for they be not without the
hazard of men's souls. We must also know that in the thoughts and motions of
our hearts, the Sabbath is to be kept, for the law is spiritual, Romans 7. and
binds the spirit and soul of a man as well as his body, as in all the rest
of the Commandments, where the action is forbidden, the affection is
forbidden, and that which is unlawful to be spoken, is unlawful to be
thought on this day, as discoursing of worldly matters vnneces^arily, either in
table talk, or otherwise, is forbidden, so the thoughts of the heart, although
never uttered. God requires the whole man, Thou sh^lt serve the Lord thy God
with all thy tho^ght.

The sins fo^bidden against the re^^ required on the S^bbath be, to do^
works, or speak words, or think^ thoughts about the affairs of this life,
further then necessity in charity requires.

2 Holy duties.
The second thing commanded, i^ performing holy exercises, whereby the day may
be sanctified; as,

Exodus 32.5.6. in which respect, we rise something the earlier, that we may
have time for this, Mark. 1.35.39.

The sin forbidden, is to omit this preparation, to bestow the time about
other matters; as many that can scarcely get out of the looking-glass by
dinnertime, but if they be ready, when the bell ringeth, they think it well:
secondly, to sleep out the time.

Secondly, to join with the public Act. 20 7. and 13.15. 2 King. 4.22.23.
Ezekiel. 46.10.

The sin is, to refuse the assembly of the Saints, and to come negligently;
to come in the fore-noone, and neglect the afternoon; as if the whole day
were not to be sanctified.

Thirdly, we are commanded to join Tim. 2.2.4.

The sin is, to separate our selves in private prayer, from the common
affection and prayer we should have with the Church. Moreover, we are
commanded to hear reverently and attentively, the Word Read and Preached, 2
King. 4.22. Act. 13.15.16. and 20.7.

The sin is, to read or pray, (as some bring books for that purpose) while
the Minister is in Preaching, whereas they should draw near to hear:
secondly, to sleep: thirdly, to talk: fourthly, to content themselves with
the Word read, living in such Parishes, where the Minister cannot Preach, or
where there is no Preaching long time together, and in a manner, a famine of
the Word, and not to seek those places where it is preached.

Another duty that we are to join with the people of God in, is, to receive
the Sacraments, Act. 20.7. another is, to gather or give to the public
gathering for the poor, 1 Cor. 16.1. The sin is, to neglect these duties.

Mal. 3.16. Psalm. 119.11.13.14.15. herein the governor of the family may
profitably to be employed, in calling his family together, to require what they
have learned, and to help them to further understanding of it, and to urge the
practice of it in their life, Genesis 18.18. Secondly, singing of Psalms, Ephesians.
5.19. Col. 3.16. Thirdly, meditation of the works of God; as of the Creation,
Redemption, preservation, Psalm. 92. Fourthly, admonishing those that fall, and
exhorting one another. Fifthly, reconciling such as be at variance. Sixthly,
visiting the sick.

The sins be to omit these duties.

5 Lastly, there is commanded, that we Esaias 58.13. Therefore although a man
exercise both his thoughts and speech in holy duties, and yet have no
cheerfulness in them, but accompteth them weariness, it is his sin.

Q. What be the reasons wherewith this fourth Commandment is urged?

A. They are three, one by a prevention drawn from the equity. ^ permitted
thee six days for thine own labor, thou shall therefore set one a part for
my service, and that is equal. Secondly, I rested the seventh day, and
sanctified it, therefore thou must do so; an argument from Gods example.
Thirdly, it is a day dedicated to my worship.

Q Concerning the fifth Commandment, Honor thy father, etc. What is generally
commanded therein?

A. To preserve the dignity of ou^ neighbor and our selves.

Q. What does this Commandment contain?

A. First, the precept it self, secondly, a reason.

Q. What is commanded in this were Honor?

A. First, reverence, both inward an^ outward, such as the manner and custom
of the Country requires to men of such place, as by rising, standing, bowing,
silence, giving precedence, Lev. 19.32. Psalm. 72.9. Secondly, obedience, 1 Pet,
2.13. Thirdly, maintenance, 1 Timothy 5.3.

Q. What is meant by Father and mother

A. All superiors by nature, by age, 1 Timothy 5.1.2. by office, as Magistrates,
Ministers, husbands, Masters, Esa. 22.21. Judge. 17.10. 2 King. 13. ^ King. 5.13.

Q. What may we learn from the order ^f the commandments of the second Table,
^his being placed first?

A. That duties commanded in the ^ther commandments for preservation ^f life,
chastity, name and goods are p^in^ipally commanded of us to those that ^e as
parents by nature, by age, or by ^ffice unto us: And the transgression ^f every
of the Commandments is a ^reater offense being against one of ^ese, then
against our equals; as to kill ^ans Father, Magistrate, tutor, etc. So (...)
speak evil of, to steal from, to rise (...) in anger against, to hate etc.
then against an equal.

Q. Why are superiors called fathers?

A. Because of the fatherly care they ^ould have for the good of their
infe^ours, being set over them for their ^ealth, Romans 13. and in this
Comman^^ment is required duty not only of ^feriours to superiors, but
interchange^ly of superiors toward inferiors.

Q. What is the duty of children to their ^turall parents?

A. First, to love them with a child^ like and natural love, cheerfully an^
continually. Secondly, to reuerenc^ them both inwardly, and by outwar^
behavior of gesture and speech, a^knowledging their authority, 1 King. 1 19.
Luke 2.51. giving them also reu^rence in their correcting of the^, Heb. 1^
Numb. 12.14. Thirdly, obediently t^ yield themselves to be governed b^ them,
especially in matter of callin^ and marriage, Numb. 30.4.5. laying v^ their
instructions in their hearts, Pro^ 6.20. Col. 3.20. Fourthly, to recompense
their care and love, with mai^taining them, according to their abili^^ in their
wants, 1 Timothy 5.

Q. What are the sins by which ch^dren break this Commandment?

A. First, by unnatural affection 2 Timothy 3.3. either not loving with cheerful
love, or not continually, Pr^^ 23.22. Secondly, to be vnreuerent (...) their
behavior toward them, mo^ing or despising them, Prove. 30.^^ Thirdly, by
disobeying their counse^ 2 Timothy 3.3. Fourthly, by making man ages for
themselves without their p^rents knowledge or consent, Exodus 22.16.17. as Esau,
Genesis 36.34. fifthly, by stealing from them, as Micah from his Mother, Judge. 17.
sixthly, by defaming them, or disclosing their secret faults, as Cham his
Fathers nakedness, Genesis 9.22. seventhly, by grieuing them through dissension
and wickedness, as Jacobs sons with Joseph: eighthly, by not relieuing them
in their want, 1 Timothy 5.4. ninthly, by cursing them, Pro. 30.11. or murmuring
at their rebukes or corrections.

Q. What be the duties of Parents toward their children?

A. From the first conception to take care of them to the end of their lives;
first, the father is to present his child with all convenient speed, In
infancy.
according ^o the assembly of the congregation, to ^he first Sacrament, that it
may be bap^ized, Luke 1.59. and the mother is to nourish it up, if she be
able, with her own milk, and to perform all motherly care and duty, 1 Timothy
5.10. Genesis ^1.7. 1 Samuel 1.29.

Secondly, according to their years and ability to train them up in the
knowledge of God and his will, Ephesians. 6.4. Pro. 22.6. by little and little, in
often repetition, and great plainness, Esa. 28.10. so framing them to be apt
to receive profit by the public ministry, in acquainting them with the
Scriptures, 2 Timothy 3.15. Deuteronomy. 6.6. and working conscience in them by
instruction of the works of God in his mercy and justice, Genesis 18.18.

The sin is, to nourish or suffer in them, the common ignorance of the world.

Thirdly, to frame them to obedience of life, Pro. 20.11. keeping the^ in
subjection with all comeliness, 1 Timothy 1. maintaining their authority by
rebuke and by correction, Pro. 29 15. and 22.15. and 20.30.

The sin is, to let them alone t^ themselves, or to use too much lenity as
Eli, 1 Samuel 2. or to be austere or rigorous, Ephesians. 6.4.

Fourthly, to walk before them in a^ good example of sobriety, godliness and
righteousness, Phil. 3.17. and 4.^ Psalm. 101.2. 1 Cor. 4.16.

The sin is, to command godlines^ to them, and to show example of all
profaneness; to send them to the assembly, and themselves tarry at home, to
swear and mock, and brawle, and lie in their hearing, etc. fifthly, according
to the diversity of their gifts, to frame them to some profitable calling, and
to beat unto them, gifts, and conscionable use of the gifts required of them,
1 Chronicles. ^8.9. Pro. 31.1. sixthly, Parents are to ^rouide for their children,
mainte^ance, and help for this life, 1 Cor. 12.^4. seventhly, In ripe age.
if they have not the gift ^f continency, to counsel them and go^erne them
unto a fit and religious mar^age, Genesis 42.2. Ruth 3.1.

The sin is, not to care for their ^aintenance, 1 Timothy 5 8. secondly, to ^ake
matches for them only for car^all respects: thirdly, to suffer them to ^e
wantonly.

Q. What is the duty of servants to their Masters, Mistresses, and Dames?

A. First, a conscionable stooping ^wne of the heart under their autho^y,
working in them fear: secondly, ^tience even under their unlawful ^rrections:
thirdly, yielding themselves to be restrained in their desires, b^ their
Masters will, with signification in gesture, speech, and whole behau^our, that
they have a feeling of the^ in their hearts, as of Gods image in the
superiority.

The sin is, contempt of heart, d^spising their masters, or equallib^
thoughts, contradicting, murmuring (...) impatience, under their lawful or v^
lawful corrections, following their o^ will, in their delights and desires.

Fourthly, servants are to be obedie^ expressing it in a prompt readiness
(...) heart, to please their masters in all li^^ full things; even in those
things that (...) hard, and in respect of their condition have some indignity
in them: v^ which is required, diligence to besto^ their time, and pains, with
all care (...) their masters profit, and faithfulness singleness of heart, as
serving the Lo^ not secretly setting apart any thing (...) themselves of their
masters goods, (...) misspending in feasting or play, (...) showing all good
faithfulness.

Their sin is, first, eye-seruice ^^condly, frowardness, doing frowa^^ that
they do, without love or care to ^e approved: thirdly, to do it only ^f
necessity or grudgingly; not as to the lord, freely, with good will: fourth^,
seeking their own profit, with their ^asters loss.

Q. What is the duty of masters to their ^^uants?

A. To keep them in subjection; ^st, for the performance of the duties (...)
holiness: secondly, for diligent per^mance of such work and labor, as is
(...) for every one, 1 Timothy 3.4. Psalm. 101.^6.8. It appears, that they are to
^epe them in subjection to the duties (...) religion, because the Commande^ent
of the Sabbath, binds them to ^^ctifie it, not only in themselves, but ^o in
their servants: and the godly ^actice of the faithful proves it, as of
Abraham, Genesis 18. Jacob, Genesis 35.2. ^huah, c. 24. v. 15. Hester, c. 4. v. 16.
^d they are bound to the common ^re by their household government, not ^ely to
further the peace of the com^on-wealth, but also of religion and ^e holiness,
1 King. 17.17. The ^rtues required in a Master for the best redressing of
faults in his family, b^ wisdom and patience; that they m^^ be thoroughly
fifted, and soundly repr^ued, out of the Word of God: yet som^times (keeping
their authority) (...) wink at some things for a time, till f^^ter occasion be
offered, Eccl. 7.21. P^ 20.21. hearing what can be alledg^ and so by equity, to
allow or dissall^^ it, Job 31.13.

The sins be, first, hastiness and (...) discretion, not making the man
plain, that the conscience may (...) touched for the fault: secondly, pri^^
not to hear any excuse, although d^uered in submission: thirdly, bitter
p^^uoking, rather then amending, ^phes. 6.4.

Thirdly, another duty of Masters to provide for their servants, necess^^
things, as convenient clothing, foo^rest, and if need be, recreation, Pr^
31.21. and 12 9. not only accord^^ to justice, paying them their due wag^ but
otherwise to help them, and l^rally to reward them, as far as Chr^^anity
shall bind them: they hau^ the strength of their age in their serui^^ Col. 4.1.

Q. What is the duty of subjects to Magistrates?

A. First, reverend subjection, stouping down under the authority set over
them, Romans 13. Secondly, to be obedient to al their lawful comma^dements with
cheerfulness. Thirdly, to pray for their prosperity and godly government, and
to give thanks for the profit we receive from their place and power.
Fourthly, to maintain them in state, according to their place, willingly and
gladly.

The sins be, first, to rebel, either in act, or purpose against their
power, Numb. 16. secondly, to murmr against them, or to entertain evil
thoughts of them, 1 King. 12.4. thirdly, to use railing speeches; Exodus 22.28.
Job 34.18. fourthly, to favor traitors, or to maintain mutinous subjects, as
they that harbor close Papists, and disguised Jesuits: fifthly, not to execute
faithfully, the office committed to them, by the Prince, either in the Church
or Commonwealth: For as the Kings throne is established by judgment and
mercy, so for want of it, it is overthrown, and where there is no vision, the
people decay. They that deceive their Prince, either in administration of
justice, or in sincere Preaching, do pull down his throne, as much as in them
is: sixthly, not cheerfully to pay tribute: seventhly, not to bear them up by
our prayers.

Q. What is the duty of Magistrates?

A. To maintain and administer justice without respect of persons, Ios. 24.27.
2 King. 11.17. Leuit. 19.11. Deuteronomy. 11.7. Amos 5.24. for the doing of this, the
chief Magistrate is to appoint in all the gates; that is, in all fit places of
public meetings, Judges and Governors, Deuteronomy. 16.8. 1 Pet. 2.13.14. and they
which are to be chosen and appointed; first, are to be known, and wise for
government, Deuteronomy. 1.15. secondly, adorned with special virtues; true, hating
gain of reward, men of courage in the fear of the Lord, and stout in the
business of justice.

The sins be, first, to give themselves to ease and pleasures, with the
neglect of their duty, or hinderance of it, Eccl. 10.16. secondly, to hinder
religion, and pervert justice, Esa. 1.23. ^eroboam has his blot that shall
never ^e forgotten, That he made Israel to ^^nne: thirdly, to delay judgment
and justice, beyond conuenience, Job 31.16. ^t was a grief to see the people
stand from morning to evening about Moses, ^waiting for dispatch.

The chief Magistrate is not discharged if he set Judges and officers which
^buse their places, Pro. 20.26. he must inquire, and after true knowledge of
the matter, reform righteously, Esa. 22.^5. 2 King. 18.8. Nehem. 5.7. and
13.^7. 2 Chro. 19.

Q. What is the duty of the husband to ^he wife, and the wife to the husband?

A. Their duties are common to both, and proper to either: common to both;
first, dwelling together, 1 Cor. ^7.10.13. secondly, communicating of persons
and goods, for mutual necessity, delight and comfort, which consists ^n due
benevolence, 1 Cor. 7.3. and mu^uall help in word and deed, to make one
another life comfortable, and to give content either to other, in the things
of this life, and the life to come. Ephesians. 5.29. Pro. 31. 1 Cor. 7.33.34.

The proper duties either to other, be, first, of the husband, for affection,
love; and of the wife, fear, Ephesians. 5.33. secondly, in action, the husband is so
wisely to dwell with his wife, patiently bearing or covering her infirmities:
yet not losing his authority, that he^ may frame her to perfection of
obedience, and make the image of Gods wisdom shine in his government, 1 Pet.
3.7. 1 Cor. 11.7.

be with sense of her condition, and womanly infirmity: secondly, to make use
of her husbands gifts f^ increase of her knowledge and judgment, 1 Cor. 14.35.

The sins common, be discord, an^ separation of the one from the other
without just and necessary cause.

The sins of the Husband be, to b^ rigorous, to deny things needful to her,
being in his power, and to be his wives underling, contrary to the ordinance
of God, 1 Cor. 3.7.8.9. Ephesians. 5.13.

A. First, to know them, which does imply a right estimation of them, according
to their work, 1 These. 5.12. Romans 10.15. 1 Cor. 3.5. and 4.1. secondly, to

lives on their behalf, 2 Cor. 12.15. seeking them, not theirs, v. 14.
fourthly, they must go before the people in all good example, Phil. 3.17. and
4.9. 1 Pet. 5.3.

The sins forbidden be, first, dumbness, Esa. 56.10. leaving the sheep to

the people for want of warning: secondly, unfaithfulness, when they preach but
pleasing things, misapply the Word, Ier. 23. or build a wall, and others daub^
it with untempered mortar; or when they mix it with their own dreams:
thirdly, negligence, although they Preach sondly, yet seldom, as once in a
quarter, or in a month. Cursed is he that does the work of the Lord

A. By a promise of long life, in which respect it is called the first
Commandment with promise, Ephesians. 6.1.

Q. How have inferiors long life by their obedience?

A. It may be, first, because the disobedience of children may be punished by
the Magistrate, Exodus 21.17. Deuteronomy. 21.21. or secondly, God himself would
punish them with some strange judgment, to cut them off, Pro. 30.17. long life
is among the blessings which God does promise to the obedience of his Law,
Psalm. 91.10.

Q. How can long life be a blessing, seeing there are so many miseries in this
life?

A First, the miseries are but by accident, not of the nature of life; consider
it in it self, it is a blessing: secondly, the celebrating of Gods name, and
worship for the good of others, is so great a good, that it ouerswaies all the
calamities of life, in which respect some of the godly have desired to live,
Esa. 38.

Jude 22.23. Heb. 3.12.13. especially Ministers of the Word, besides the me^nes
aforesaid, by preaching sound doctrine, faithfully and diligently to the
capacity of the hearers, Act. 20.28. 1 Cor. 10.28. 1 Pet. 5.2. 2 Timothy 4.2. and

authority, according to their power, to outward obedience, and submission to
the means, as Genesis 18.19. Ios. 24.15. Nehem. 13.15. etc. Hest. 4.15.16.

The sins forbidden be, first, not to love the soul of our brother:
secondly, to neglect such duties of love as tend to the safety of it, Ier.
3.11. Ioh. 6.27. as to famish it for want of food. Instruction is called

^orbidden, Romans 1.31. and not testify^ng our dislike, so far as conveniently
^e may: and as every one is more bound ^y his calling and place, so is his
sin ^^e greater; in saying with Cain in deed, though not in word; Am I my
bro^^ers keeper? whether he be Minister, ^agistrate, Master of a family, etc.

freely forgiving injuries without r^uenge.

Secondly, kind-heartednesse goodness, which is a general rea^nesse and

exercise justice in private revenge, and when they exercise cruelty in
inflicting punishments: ninthly, saving wilful murderers, or remitting

Q. What duties to our selves are here required?

A. Some things concerning our souls, and some our bodies: first, Touching our
souls, we ought to hear the word, and receive the sacraments, and to hearken
to the admonition of others, and to get such grace, as is peculiar to the
elect: which belong to life and growth, we live in a growing age, John 6.68.
Act. 5.20. and 11.

The sins forbidden be contempt of the word and Sacraments, Act. 13.46.
despising private admonition and living wickedly.

Secondly, Concerning our bodily life, we ought to preserve our life and
health, endeavoring by all good means the safety thereof, as by moderate food,
apparel, moderate labor, moderate sleep, physic, and to nourish
cheerfulness, Eccle. 5.17.19. to use some ^ecreation lawful, honest, and of
good report, also to repel violence offered, by just defense; so as it be not
done with a mind, to hurt or revenge. Also to fly infections if we be free, and
not bound by our callings to abide in the place.

The sins forbidden be, first, to offer violence to a man's self, and because
each man is a part of the communion and fellowship, of mankind, he does injury
to the common wealth in taking away a member of it. Moreover life is the gift
of God, and to his only power subdued, so there is an injury to God, Genesis 9.5.

Secondly, we sin by worldly cares and sorrows, when we bring diseases upon
us by them, and consume our natural moisture: we should raise up our sad
soul, as David does, P^^. ^3. Thirdly, when we neglect such means, as may
prevent diseases, or cure them, and preserve health. Fourthly, when we offer
our selves willingly to danger, and thrust our selves willingly into the hands
of bloody men.

Q. Concerning the seventh commandment, Thou shall not commit adultery, what
is the scope and sum thereof?

A. To preserve the chastity of our selves and others, Lev. 18.24. Deuteronomy. 23.17.
Prove. 5.8. Romans 13.13. More particularly here is commanded, first the parts of
chastity: secondly, the means: thirdly, the signs thereof.

First sort of duties.
The parts are these, first, the mind is to judge aright of the excellency of
chastity, Math. 5.8.28. 2 Cor. 7.1. Heb. 13.4.

The sins forbidden contrary hereunto be, to think fornication venial or a
small sin, Gal. 5.19. etc. and to think basely of marriage.

Secondly, we are commanded to have

The sin is unlawful lusting, Mat. 5.28. Col. 3.5. which is called evil
concupiscence, or the inward burning of lust, which shows some man's necessity
of marriage, which is when the godliness of his heart is overwhelmed, and as it
were burnt with fire, 1 Cor. 7.9.

Thirdly, outward chastity, both to

Sins forbidden be, first, fornication, an unclean act about generation
between a single man, and a single woman, Gal. 5.19. Secondly, adultery, an
unclean act between two, whereof one at the least is either contracted, or
married, Deuteronomy. 22.32. Thirdly, rape, a violent defiling of any maid, widow, or
wife, taking her from her parents, tutors, or governors, either to marry her
or not, Genesis 6.7. and 34.25. 2 Samuel 13. Fourthly, Onans sin, Genesis 38.9.

For the second, chastity in marriage, consider, first, a right entrance into

into marriage in a holy manner, 1 Cor. 7.2. there is required, first, seeking of
a yoke fellow by prayer to God, Genesis 24.12.60. and 28.2.2. Secondly, some
fitness for marriage duties. Thirdly, equality in respect of religion, 2 Cor.
6.14. 1 Cor. 7.39. Fourthly, a fit distance in respect of kindred, Lev. 18.
Fifthly, consent of parents, 1 Cor. 7.38. Deuteronomy. 7.3. and of parties themselves,
Genesis 24.57. Sixthly, propound the right ends of marriages, namely mutual help
and comfort, Genesis 2.18.20. increase of the Church in the younger fort, Genesis
1.28. Mal. 2.15. and avoiding of incontinency, 1 Cor 7.2. Seventhly, not to
know each other, as husband and wife, until marriage be consummated, Exodus 22.

The sins forbidden in this respect by unlawfully contracted marriages be,
first, when believers marry with unbelievers, they sin against the holiness
of marriage.

Ob. The unbeliever is sanctified to the believer.

A. That is of them which were both unbelievers in their contract, or marriage,
and one of them after converted.

Secondly, when the parties contracted are within the degrees forbidden, either
by affinity or consanguinity, Lev. 18. 1 Cor. 5.

Thirdly, when the parties contracted are unapt for marriage, either by natural
weakness and imperfection, or by having some foul, incurable, and contagious
disease.

Fourthly, when the parties contract themselves, without the consent of
parents, Exodus 22.15.

Fifthly, by polygamy, taking many wives together, or more then one during her
life, 1 Cor. 7.2.

For the next branch, a right living together when marriage is consummated,
first, they are to delight in each other, Prove. 5. Secondly, not to forsake
each other till death, 1 Cor. 7.

Sins forbidden be, first intemperate use of marriage, and that for then
satisfying of lust, rather then suppressing it, that there should appear a
difference between the people of God, and infidels, and between men and
beasts that come together in the rage of lust, 1 These. 4. Secondly, companying
with a woman, when she is by Gods Law and nature set apart, Levit. 18.12. Joel
2.15. Thirdly, brawling between husband and wife, Col. 3. Fourthly, disdain
of each other, 2 Samuel 6. Fifthly, unlawful divorce or forsaking each other,
Matt. 5.32. and 19.9.

2. The means.
The second sort of duties commanded be the means of chastity, as first,
looking to the senses of seeing, hearing, etc. Job 31. Secondly, labor in our
particular calling, 1 Cor. 7.17.24. Thirdly, sobriety in food, Pro. 23.29.33.
apparel, 1 Pet. 3. and ^ecreations.

The sins forbidden be, al such means ^s inflame lust, as first abuse of our
senses; ^f our eyes by wanton and wandering ^usts, Matt. 5.28. 1 John 2.16. 2
Pet. 2.^4. Job 31.1. our ears by harkening ^o unchaste and wanton talk, Esaias

of ^read, Ezekiel. 16.49. Fourthly, wanton ^ancing of men and women, by las^ui^us
gestures provoking lust, Job 20.11.

Ob. 2 Samuel 6. David's example, Ex^dus 15. Miram danced Eccl. 3.

A. These are not warrants for the ^anton dancings now used, so far being
^nlike, first, the matter moving their ^ancing was some special benefit of
God, as of David, the bringing home ^f the Ark of God: Of Miriam, the ^he
deliverance of Israel, and overthrow of Pharaoh, the matter of these,
lig^nesse, wantonness; secondly, the e^^ of theirs, was to witness Gods
goo^nesse, and to give praise to God. Therefore David said to Micol that mock^
him, I did it before the Lord. Th^^ have their ends diverse, but all corrup^
either to approve themselves in their ^^pish gestures, friskes, capers, iump^
turns to the beholders, as Herod's wi^^ daughter; or other carnal ends,
satis^^ing their own carnal lusts.

Fifthly, Our ordinary usual stag^ plays and interludes, for first, ther^
confunding of sex by apparel, whi^^ seems contrary to the express L^^
Secondly, there is filthy acting in (...) seemly gesture, the sins of other.
Contrary to that, Let it not be once name^ among Christians, Ephesians. 5. and man

In particular, concerning our neighbors, there is commanded first in the mind

actions as be here enjoined, for the l^^ is spiritual, Romans 7. Mat. 7.12.

The sins be first, the outward act^on without affection to the virtue.
Secondly, consenting to or fauourin^ theft, Psalm. 50. Prove. 1. and 29.24.

Fourthly, to walk in some hon^^ vocation, whereby he may derive (...)

(...) the people from his father, or as false ^^chers from God. Romans 16. they
whose ^^uth is a snare, and whose hands as ^rs and bands, Eccl. 7.

Seventhly, faithfulness and constan^^ in words, and promises, Psalm. 15.4.
^ov. 25.14.

The sin is breaking covenant ei^^r simply, by which we bring damage ^our
neighbor, Amos 1.9. or in some ^^ect of time as they that having promised
faithfully and are put in trust, defraud widows, or orphans, Prove. 3.27.
denying to pay debts, or deferring to their loss, that gave them day for
payment, keeping back the wages of servants, or changing it as Laban did
I^cobs, Deuteronomy. 24.15 Iam. 5.4. denying o^ deferring to restore that which is
r^ceiued to be kept, Exodus 22. withholding the pledge, or using it to the lo^^
of our neighbor, Amos 2.8.

Eighthly, justice and righteousn^^ in bargaining, 1 These. 4.6. Phil. 2.4. C^^

Secondly, to sell that which is not to (...) sold, as justice, the goods of the
Chu^^ Prove. 20.25. souls, Rev. 18.13. Thir^ when corrupt wares are sold for g^
and pure; Amos 8.6. Fourthly, to (...) diue^s weights, a greater to buy w^ and
a lesser to sell with, so of measu^^ Deuteronomy. 25.13.14. Lev. 19.35. Fifthly
conceal the fault, and color it (...) deceit, Mat. 7.12. Pro. 20.14. to (...)
^o lower price by his necessity that must ^ell.

Ninthly, restoring things found, la^ouring to find out the owner, Deuteronomy. ^2.1,
2, 3.

The sin is to detain the goods from ^^e owner, Prove. 3.27. as they that find
^he purse, the beast, or any thing else of another man's and conceal it.

Tenthly, to use only honest and good ^eanes of getting, Ephesians. 4.28.

The sins be to gather treasures of ^ickednesse, as by open and violent
^heft, Zach. 5. by oppression, Eccl. 7.8. ^y unlawful pyracie, by play for
gain, ^y usury, Prove. 28.8. which is a certain ^aine by covenant for the bare
act of ^^nding.

The duties concerning our selves are ^rst, to labor in a lawful calling for
^ur own maintenance, 2 These. 3.12. ^^condly, to order expenses according ^o
our ability, Pro. 27.25, 26. Thirdly, ^o avoid rash suretiship, Pro. 6.1, 2.
and ^ot lightly to give credit to the hazar^ing of what is gotten by lawful

Fifthly, in giving and lending, to have respe^ to our ability. Psalm. 112.5. 2

Q. Concerning the Ninth Commandment, Thou shall not bear false witness
against thy neighbor, what is command^^ and forbidden herein?

A. In general, to defend the goo^ name of our neighbor, and of our selue^ and
therefore to speak the truth and ^uoid lying.

Inward duties.
In particular, there is commande^ first inwardly in the mind to know t^^
excellency of a good name, Prove. 22.^ Eccl. 7.1. and of the truth, Ephesians. 4.1^
Secondly, in thoughts taking thin^ doubtful in the best part, as far as m^ be,

fection a gladness to hear good rep^ of others, and evil with grief, Romans
8. Ezra 9. Fourthly, love of the tru^^ Psalm. 15.2. Prove 13.5.

Sins forbidden here be, first, desp^sing others, Prove. 14.21. Secondl^
disdaining and envying at the credit (...) others, 1 Cor. 13.4. Thirdly, unjust
suspicion, 1 Timothy 6.4. Fourthly, thinking lying to be no sin, or very small,
not hating lying, nor loving the truth.

Outward duties be either in public course of judgment, Outward duties.
Public
or in private conversation: In public course of judgment, first, Judges not
to be too credulous Psa. 101.5. Deuteronomy. 19.16, 17, 18, 19. and therefore not to
proceed without sufficient witnesses, Deuteronomy. 19.15. Mat. 18.16, 17. 1 Timothy 5.19.

The sin is to entertain false accusations, Proverb. 27.12. 2 Samuel 16.2.3. 1 Samuel 22.9, 10, etc. Secondly, witnesses

The sin is, when witnesses testify false things, Deuteronomy. 19.16, 17, 18, 19. 1
Kings 21.13. Matt. 26.61. 1 Samuel 22.9, 10.

Concerning private conversation, Private
first by word or writing, to testify the Sam. 20.24. 1 Cor. 16.10. 2 Cor.
8.22, 23. 3 John 12.

The sin is, first to omit the defense of the good name of our neighbor, Pro.

The sin is first rash and light speaking of, and spreading abroad the sins
others, Leuit. 19.16. Secondly, praising wicked persons, Prove. 28.4. Thirdly,
spreading false and slanderous reports, Ps. 15.3. Fourthly, speaking evil of
that which may or ought to be taken in good sense, 1 Samuel 17. 2 Samuel 10.13,
14. Romans 1.28. Mat. 7.1.

Lev. 19.16. Prove. 25.9.11.13. or being commonly known, they are to be spoken
of with compassion to the offenders (if they be not desperate opposers of
grace:) or for the warning of others, Gal. 6.1. John 66.67. Romans 11.20, 21, 22.

The sin is to publish secret faults, Prove. 11.13.

4 Privately to admonish others of Leuit. 19.16.17. Pro. 27.5.6. and to
instruct them in good duties, whereby they may get and keep a good name.

The sin is, first, omission of private reproves, and instruction: secondly,
unmerciful censuring the slippes and weaknesses of our brethren, Iam. 4.11.

5 In all our words we must avouch Ephesians. 4.25. and where in wisdom any thing
ought to be concealed, it must be done either by silence or such words, as
contain nothing but truth in them, 1 Samuel 16.2.3. using few and wise speeches,
Prou. 10.19.

Concerning this last point of truth, there is required more particularly, not
to be rash in receiving reports, Pro. 11.9. and to report nothing for truth,
but what we know, speaking doubtful things, doubtfully. And we ought to
join with promises, a purpose of performing them, without equiuocating, and
after to perform them accordingly, unless, first, by mutual consent the
things promised be altered; or secondly, the promises were unlawful, being
against Gods Word, or made by him that wanted reason and discretion, or that
was not able to bind himself, being under the government of his Parents, or
were at the first lawful, and afterward unlawful and impossible.

The sins forbidden be, first, all kinds of lies pernicious, jesting, or
officious, Romans 3.7.8. Ephesians. 4.4.9. secondly, willing embracing lies from
others: or lightly giving credit to them, Pro. 14.15. thirdly, auouching as
truths, things unknown and doubtful: fourthly, unfaithful promising,
equiuocating, and breaking promise.

Concerning our own good name, there is commanded a care of getting and
preserving the same: first, by avoiding evil, and the appearance of it, Eccl.
10.1. secondly, by being plentiful in good works, Phil. 4.8. Pro. 10.7
thirdly, by using lawful means to clear our selves from slanderous
imputations, Psalm. 101.5. fourthly, to have a care to think and speak well of
others, Math. 7.2. Eccl. 7.23. and if praise of good men be added to our work,
it is not to be contemned, but if it be wanting, it is to be taken in good
part, 2 Cor. 1.12. Psalm. 16.6. 1 Cor. 1.31.

The sins forbidden be, first, vain boasting: secondly, accusing our selves
falsely: thirdly, losing our good name by sinful courses, Pro. 6.33. fourthly,
neglect of just and orderly defense of a man's credit in matters of weight.

Q. Concerning the tenth Commandment, Thou shall not covet, etc. what is
commanded and forbidden therein?

A. The scope of this Commandment is, that our minds be full of that
charity, which may be free, even from evil thoughts and lusts, that so the
internal powers of the reason and will of man be carried to good, in the
duties concerning man: in particular, there is commanded, first, Ephesians. 4.23. 1
These. 5.23.
a mind rightly informed of Gods wisdom and justice, concerning our outward
estate: secondly, affections and motions holy, so as, first, to be contented
with that portion of outward things which God has given us, and in want of any
thing to rest until God give it, or by lawful means we may be disburdened
of afflictions: secondly, to rejoice at the prosperous estate of our
neighbors: thirdly, to repress evil motions, Romans 7.22.

The sins forbidden be, first, delight in evil motions, although without
consent to do the evil, or to the titillation or delight, Ephesians. 4.18. Luke
10.27. Gal. 5.17. secondly, not repressing evil motions, but giving way to
envy at others prosperity, or to rejoice at their adversity.

Q. You have showed already, that no man in this world can perfectly and
legally keep all these Commandments, tell me now more fully to what use or
profit the Law serves.

A. First, it teaches us the nature of God, that he is just, true, bountiful,
holy, according to the image of him expressed in the Law: secondly, it shows
us what our estate was in our original righteousness in Adam before the fall;
namely, a perfect conformity with the whole Law of God: thirdly, it reuealeth
the nature of sin, and is a testimony of the judgment of God, especially at
the last day: fourthly, it is in some sort a schoolmasters to Christ, although
it do not teach him, in that it shows us our misery, so as we must go out
of our selves, if we would be saved; and serves to prepare us to be humble:
fifthly, it is a rule of good life, to which all our counsels, studies and
actions are to be directed, that we may daily aspire to more holiness, and it
is the rule of civil actions amongst men, and the bond of humane society, and
does teach us, what our estate of holiness shall be at the resurrection, when
this law shall be perfectly fulfilled by us.

Q. As you have showed in some measure the meaning of the Creed, and ten
Commandments, proceed to the Lords Prayer, and first tell me what prayer is.

A. Prayer is an asking of things lawful of God in the name of Christ, with a
contrite heart and affiance to be heard, and giving thanks to God for benefits
received or promised, Phil. 4.6. Ioh. 16.23. Psalm. 51.17. 2 Chronicles. 20.18.19.

Q. Why should we pray, seeing God knows what we want before we ask, and we
cannot move God with our prayers?

A. First, because God has commanded us to pray, Psalm. 50.15. secondly, that
we may thus worship God, acknowledging him the author of every good thing,
Psalm. 106.23. Ier. 22.30.31. thirdly, because of our necessity considered with
Gods order, who reserueth to prayer, things that otherwise he will not do or
give, Matthew. 17.21. Iam. 4.2. Ezekiel. 36.37.

Q. The Lords Prayer being a perfect pattern of prayer, tell me how many parts
it does contain.

A. Three: first, a Preface; secondly, Petitions; thirdly, the Conclusion.

Q Concerning the Preface in these words, Our Father which art in heaven, who
is meant by the word Father?

A. Properly the first person in the Trinity, called God the Father; first,
because he is the Father of Christ by nature; secondly, in him he is our
Father by adoption and regeneration, Matthew. 23.9.

Q. To whom ought we to pray?

A. Only to God, and not to Saints or Angels, Psalm. 50.15. first, because God
will not give his glory to others, Esa. 42.8. Romans 10.14. secondly, he only
is every where present, and alsufficient, able and willing to hear us, and we
have no other Father in heaven, but him, Esa. 63.16. 1 King. 8.27. Psalm. 73.29.

Q. May we not pray to God the Son, and to God the holy Ghost, as well as to
the Father?

A. Yes, Act. 7.59. 2 Cor. 13.13. the Father is named here, being first in
order, yet so as we then imply the Son and holy Ghost: also there is but one
name, one kingdom, and one will of the whole Trinity, and every one of them is
Father to us, although in the respect they have to themselves, there is but one
Father, Esa. 9.6. Iam. 1.17.

Q. What learn you further in calling God our Father?

A. That it is possible and necessary to know that we are the children of God,
Romans 8.16. and that only the children of God can make an acceptable prayer to
him, Psalm. 66.18. Pro. 15.8. Ioh. 9.31. and we ought to know, and may know,
that God will grant our petitions, Iam. 1.5.6. 1 Ioh. 5.14.15.

Q. Why say we Our, and not My Father?

A. Because although every one must believe for himself, and therefore says,
I believe, yet he must pray for others, as well as for himself, and it is
comfortable that all believers pray for every one. Hab. 2.4. Iam. 5.16.


Q For whom ought we to pray?

A. For Magistrates and Ministers 1 Timothy 2.1.2. 9 These. 3.1 2. Mat. 5 41. 1
Ioh. 5 16.
, for all sorts, not only friends, but enemies, unless they sin against the
holy Ghost, (which sin is not ordinarily or commonly discerned in men,) and
we may not pray for the dead 2 Samuel 12.16. Ioh. 3.18. Heb. 1.3. 2 Cor. 5.10
Math. 12.36.13. God is not in pla^e circumscriptiuely, or d^finitiuely, but
repletiuely.
, because there is no Purgatory after this life, and we have no warrant for
such prayers, an^ they will do no good; for if they be^ regenerate, their
souls be immediately after their d^^th, carried by the Angels to heaven; and
if they died in the^ sins, they be irrecouerably damne^ in hell, Rom 14 23.
Phil. 1.23. 2 Cor. 5.1. 2. Reu. 14.13. Luke 16.23.24. Reu. 21.8

Q Why is God said to be in heaven, seeing he is everywhere?

A. Because in heaven, God dot^ especially manifest his power, wisedom^ and
goodness, and that we might reue^ence Gods infinite Majesty, and know ^e is
able to help us, and our desires and minds should be in heaven, confessing
our selves strangers here, Psalm. 57.3. and 18.17. and 115.3.

Q. Concerning the first Petition, Hallowed be thy Name: what does this word
Name signify?

A. First, God himself his titles and ^ttributes, Psalm. 115.1. secondly, his
Word and ordinances, Exodus 18.15. ^hirdly, his works of creation and
pro^idence, and therein his mercies and ^^dgements.

Q. What is meant by this word Hal^^wed?

A. To be acknowledged holy, and ^sed holily, Luke 7.29.35.

Q What is the equity and necessity of ^is Petition?

A. First, because Gods name only excellent, and his praise above heaven ^d
earth, Psalm. 148.12. secondly, he ^^th made all things for his own glo^^,
Prou. 16.14. Romans 11.36. thirdly, ^od being our Father, and having san^^ified
and separated us to be a holy people to himself, it is meet we should show
forth his virtues, 1 Pet. 2.9. fourthly, we are naturally blind, not able to
find our the glory of God in himself, his ordinances and works, Romans 8.7.
and 3.10. fifthly, we are naturally proud, seeking our own glory more then
Gods, and do not esteem^ God aright.

Q. What things do we pray for in the first Petition?

A. Some things concerning ou^ hearts, some our tongues, and some ou^ actions.
For the first, concerning ou^ hearts; first, we pray that Gods nam^ may be
known, Psalm. 76.1. Exodus 14.17.18. Psalm. 119.33. secondly, that we^ and others
may be diligent to mark and observe Gods nature, ordinance^ and works in
judgments and mercie^ Psalm. 107.43. and 8.1.3. and 139.14 17.18. Job.
36.24.25. that we may be^ able to honor God, by believing Go^ and his word,
as Abraham did, Romans 4 fourthly, that we may love him about all things, and
be zealous of his glory Ios. 7.8.9. 1 King. 19.10. Psalm. 42.3.4. fifthly, that
we may fear him above all Esaias. 8.13. Psalm. 86.11. and be humble: sixthly, that
with our souls we may be thankful, admiring and highly esteeming him, Psalm.
103.1. Deuteronomy. 8.11.

For the second, namely, concerning our tongues, we pray that we may, first,
praise his goodness, truth and power, Psalm. 9.1. and 108.1. secondly, confess
his truth, and defend his honor, according to our place and gifts, opposing
such as blaspheme: thirdly, for our actions natural, civil and religious,
that we may do them in a right manner, that God may be glorifi^d, Deuteronomy.
23.12.13.14. Tit. 2.5. 1 Cor. 10.31. 1 Samuel 2.17.

Q. What do we pray against in the first ^etition?

A. First, concerning our hearts; first, against atheism, Psalm. 10.4.
secondly, against ignorance of the things of God: ^hirdly, against pride, Luke
18.11. ^ourthly, against hardness of heart, Mark. 6.52. fifthly, against a
mean opi^ion of God: sixthly, against forgetful^esse of God, Deuteronomy. 8.11.
seventhly, against distrust: eighthly, against want of ^eale of Gods glory:
ninthly, against ^ypocrisie.

Secondly, concerning our tongues; first, against swearing falsely, vainly, or
by creatures, and against all blaspheming, Zach. 5.4. Ier. 23.10. and 5.7.
secondly, against mocking at good things, Pro. 17.5. Psalm. 109.17.18. thirdly,
against unthankfulness to God: fourthly, against omission of confession, by
not speaking for God, when he is dishonored by others: fifthly, against
ascribing to idols, that which belongs to God.

Thirdly, Concerning our conuersasation, against leading an unholy life in the
profession of religion, Romans 2.24.

Q. What is contained in this first Petition, besides these supplications for
good things, and deprecations against evils?

A. First, confession, that of our selves we cannot thus glorify God:
secondly, a thankful ascribing to God the working of such graces, as we
desire herein, and that he has given us a desire to seek his glory, and
enabled us in some measure to be fit instruments to set forth his holiness and
praises.

Q. Concerning the second Petition, Thy Kingdom come, what is meant thereby?

A. The word Kingdom, signifies the Kingdom, first, of Gods providence:
secondly, of grace: thirdly, of glory. And this word, Come, signifies to be,
to continue, to be increased, to be revealed to our knowledge more and more.

Q. What is the equity and necessity of this second Petition?

A. We are to pray for the coming of the Kingdom of Gods providence; first,
because Gods glory is showed forth hereby, Psalm. 19.1. and 104.24.25. Act.
14.15.17. secondly, because it does afford matter and means for the Kingdom
of grace, in propagating and upholding the Church. Concerning the Kingdom of
grace, the necessity thereof appears; first, because the devil has his
kingdom and throne among men, yea all men naturally, Ioh. 14.30. Act. 26.18.
secondly, the flesh, the natural viciousness, which loves disorder, preferres
the reign of the devil, and sets wicked things before just, 1 Pet. 4.3.
Ioh. 8.45. Ephesians. 4.18.19. thirdly, the whole judgment of the world, prefers
earthly things before heavenly, evil before good, resisting, hating or
persecuting the Kingdom of God, Ioh. 7.7. Romans 1.25. 1 Cor. 16.9.

Q. What is the order or placing of thi^ Petition?

A. The first Petition tends to the glory of God, the chief end of our life,
the second and third, note the meane^ tending to that end; the second, in tha^
God is glorified when his Kingdom i^ erected in our he^rts, and the third i^
for the manifestation of ou^ subjection acknowledging Gods sovereignty in (...)
loyal yielding our selves to him, an^ so glorifying him.

Q. What do we pray for in the secon^ Petition?

A. Concerning the Kingdom o^ Gods providence, that we and other may
acknowledge, observe, and reverence the providence of God, governing and
disposing all things, Ac^ 14.15.17.

1 Grace. Psalm. 51.
Concerning the Kingdom of grace we pray, first, that God may rule in o^^
hearts by his spirit, and the Kingdom^ of God may not only be erected, b^^
established and increased, and sin wasted and overcome

And concerning others, we pra^ that the number of such as profess the truth,
may be increased daily, that such as shall be saved, may be added to the
Church, Ezekiel. 37.22.24. Romans 11.26. and that such as have grace, may be endued
with greater grace, and more spiritual gifts, and be more and more confirmed,
Col. 1.9. Phil. 1.9.

Secondly, 2 The means of grace, as
we desire the means by which God uses to erect and increase ^his Kingdom;
which are first, Magistrates by good laws, and the execution Hos. 11.12. Psalm.
72.1.7. Esa. 49.23. 1 King. 15.12. Eccl. 10.16.17.

Secondly, faithful Ministers, not Act. 13.14. and 15.21. Psalm. 110.2. Matthew.
21.43. that they may be able and willing to Preach the Word, to the
edification of the body of Christ, Mat. 9.37.38. Ephesians. 6.19.20. Act. 4.29. Deuteronomy.
33.8.10. and that God would preserve them for the work of the Ministry, from
the persecution of tyrants and wicked men, Romans 15.30.31. 2 These. 3.1. and that
the two Sacraments, Baptism and the Lords Supper, may be purely and duly
administered, according to the first institution, being mean^ of increase of
grace, Romans 4.11. and tha^ we and others may be desirous an^ willing, with
prepared hearts, to be partakers thereof, Act. 9.37.38. Luke 1.6. 1 Cor.
11.24.25.26. etc.

And for discipline, the keys of the Kingdom of heaven, that they may rightly
be used for shutting up heaven, and delivering to Satan, obstinate sinners, and
releasing the penitent, Matthew. 16.19. and 18.15.16.17.18. and 7.6. 1 Cor. 5.5.
2 Cor. 2.6. 2 These. 3.14.15.

These. 3.1. 1 Cor. 3.7. 2 Cor. 3.5. Ezekiel. 36.26.27.

Matthew. 13.11. freedom from the curse of the law, and from the dominion of
sin, to have such spiritual dignity, as is peculiar to the elect, 1 Pet.
2.9. Reu. 1.6. and to know that we have the same to the glory of God.

Lastly, we are to pray for the Kingdom of glory at death, and especially at
the day of judgment that we may then be subjects perfectly obedient to God,
Romans 8.23. 2 Cor. 5. Phil. 1.23. Rev. 22.20.

Q. What do we pray against in the second Petition?

A. Concerning the Kingdom of Gods providence, against ascribing things to
fortune or destiny, and against swelling in pride against God, Exodus 5.2. Dan.
3.15.

Concerning the Kingdom of grace, we pray against all lets and hindrances of
this Kingdom, as first against the dominion and tyranny of the devil, and
sin, that God would weaken and wast them, till they be abolished utterly,
Romans 16.20. 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. And against all the evil courses of such men as
are slaves to sin, and Satan, and confederate with them; whether they be open
foes or false friends, which by force or fraud go about to undermine and
resist the Kingdom of Christ. The most notorious of these, are the Turk,
Pope, and Antichristian hierarchy; and against libertines, that cast off all
conscience, and turn the grace of God into wantonness.

Secondly, concerning Magistrates, first, against the anarchy of the
Anabaptists, that would have no Magistrates at all. Secondly, against evil
government, when evil Magistrates set up the Kingdom of Satan in Paganism,
Mahometisms, Papisme, Atheism, or any superstition, or tolerate strange
religion, Act. 18.17. Cant. 5.7. we pray against wicked laws and statutes,
that either the making or execution of them may be hindered, such as was
against Daniel, or against the Jews by Haman, not praying against the
magistracy, but their proceedings against the truth, Psalm 68.1, 2. Ezrah 6.12.

Thirdly, concerning the sins of the ministry, we pray against, first,
ignorance, for which God refuses them to minister to him, Host. 4.6. Esa.
56.10. Secondly, false doctrine, which fretteth like a gangrene, 2 Timothy 2.17.
Romans 16.17. Thirdly, against idleness, when they feed not the flock, but eat
the milk, and cloth them with the wool, and the sheep be scattred. Fourthly,
against flattery and false application, daubing with untempered mortar, Ezekiel.
13. Jude 16. Fifthly, against rising up against the lawful ministry, that is
allowed of God, causing hatred, Hos. 9.8. or raising trouble to the ministry,
Deuteronomy. 33.11. 1 Cor. 16.10. Sixthly, against adding false sacraments and
corrupting the true. Seventhly, against abusing the power of the keys or
discipline. Eighthly, against absence of the saving power and spiritual
efficacy from the means: generally against all the enemies of Gods kingdom,
as they be enemies; especially such as be incurable; which because we cannot
know particularly in ordinary course, we pray against incurable enemies in
general: and for particulars, that God will convert them if they belong to
him, or conditionally if they be incurable, that God would restrain or subvert
them, Esa. 68.28. Psa. 104.35. Judge. 5.31. Gal. 5.12. Phil. 1.28, 29. and 3.19.
2 These. 1.6. Rev. 19.1.6. Psalm. 10.16, 17.

Concerning the kingdom of glory, we pray against first, imagining that there
is any full perfection on earth, secondly, against atheistical denying of the
blessed glorious kingdom.

Q. What is further contained in the second petition?

A. First, a confession that of our selves we cannot do the things we pray for,
and secondly, a thanksgiving ascribing to God, the right ordering of the world;
and for that contrary to the kingdom of darkness, he has erected the
kingdom of his son, and chosen, and called us to the same, Psalm. 101.3, 4,
6. Mat. 11.25. Ephesians. 1.3. Phil. 1.4, 5. Col. 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13. 1 These.
2.13. Reu. 11.17.

Q. Concerning the third petition, Thy will be done in earth as it is in
heaven, whereas Gods will is revealed or secret, what do we pray for?

A. First, for grace to deny our selves, Mat. 16.24. Ezekiel. 18.31. Secondly, for
knowledge of Gods revealed will, Prove. 2.10.11. Psalm. 119.27.34. Col. 1.9.
Thirdly, for faith to believe, that the will of God revealed to us, is his
will: and to apply his gracious promises unto our own souls, Ioh. 6.40. 1
Ioh. 3.23. Fourthly, that God would give us love of obedience, and allure us
thereunto effectually, that he would incline us to ^his law, and teach us to
do his will with effect; and that not only in our general, but also in our
particular vocations, Psalm. 143.10. Phil. 2.13. Ezekiel. 36.26.27. Fifthly, for
patience and strength when it shall please God at any time to exercise us under
the cross, Col. 1.12.

Concerning Gods secret will, we may not always pray that it may be done, but
when by the event we see what God will have done, we patiently rest ^n it,
and pray that we may do so, 1 Samuel 3.18. 2 Samuel 15.25.26. Esa. 39.^.7.8.

Q. What do we pray against?

A. First, against atheism, when men live, as if there were no God, no
^onscience, no heaven, or hell, Job 21.14. Psalm. 14. 1. Mal. 3.14.15. Tit.
1.16. ^econdly, against ignorance of Gods will: thirdly, against rebellion,
when men peremptorily resist Gods will, known and urged upon their
consciences: foutthly, against pride, cauilling against any of Gods decrees,
and judgments, Romans 9.19.20. or rising in heart against any of his ways,
Jonah 4. fifthly, against impatience in afflictions, Heb. 12.9. sixthly, against
taking occasion by commandments and rules of duties to fly from God, through
desperation, ignorant of the covenant of grace; or to think we have strength
in our selves to do the duties commanded.

Q. What do we pray for in these words, In earth as it is in heaven?

A. As the Angels and Saints in heaven do the will of God, sincerely,
cheerfully, willingly, speedily, universally and constantly, that we may do
so, aspiring toward heavenly righteousness, 2 Samuel 14.17. Luke 8.15. Matthew.
18.10. Esa. 6.2. and 64.5. Psalm. 119.60. 2 Samuel 24.16.17. Psalm. 18.22. and
106.3.

Q. What do we pray against?

A. First, hypocrisy: secondly, weariness in well-doing: thirdly, contenting
our selves with outward civil honesty, void of faith, and not regarding
universal obedience, Esa. 29.13. Gal. 6.9. Matthew. 5.20.

Q. What is the equity and necessity of this petition?

A. First, because of Gods soueraign power and holiness, it is meet we obey
him, Mal. 1.6. 1 Samuel 3.18. Romans 7.2. Esa. 39.8.

Secondly, the many lets against the doing of the will of God, grieve the
child of God, and in zeal move him to pray, Thy will be done; as first, the
elect themselves are naturally ignorant of Gods will, both in the Law and
Gospel, Tit. 3.3. secondly, their will is naturally more rebellious, then
their mind is ignorant, Ier. 31.18.19. Psalm. 25. Col. 1.21. Romans 8.7. and
7.5.8. 1 Pet. 4.2. yea the elect converted, find a lusting against the Law of
God, and have the flesh in them so working, that they are ignorant of many
things, and their wills renewed but in part, and so they do not as they should,
Romans 7. Gal. 5.17.

Thirdly, the devil, and fourthly, the world are great enemies to the doing of
Gods will; therefore the zeal of Gods children ought to carry the^ with
earnestness, for the doing of Gods will, Psalm. 119.126.

Q. What is further included in this third petition?

A. First, a confession of our natural rebellion and disobedience, Romans 7.24.
secondly, a thankful ascribing to God, the power which he has begun in
us, to be obedient to his will, Romans 7.25.

Q. Concerning the fourth petition, Give us this day our daily bread, what do
we pray for in the same, or what is meant by daily bread?

A. All things necessary for the maintenance of this life.

Q. Before you show more particularly what we pray for, declare the order of
this petition.

A. In the three former, we pray for things immediately concerning God, in this
and the Petitions following, we pray for things concerning our selves; in this
fourth, for things concerning our bodies; and in the fifth and sixth for things
concerning our souls: now things concerning the body, are here set down,
before things concerning the soul, not as if they were more excellent, for
elsewhere grace is put before peace, Romans 1.7. Pro. 3^.7. Matthew 6.33. but for
these reasons, first, because if there be not provision for our subsistence
and b^ing in life, we cannot here serve Gods glory, and be sustained in his
service, which is the chief end of our desire of life, Psalm. 18 17. and 119.
17. Esa. 38. Phil. 1.20.21. R^m 14.7. secondly, because there is an infirmi^y
in us, that many dare less put themselves over to the hope of Gods promises,
for the body, then f^r the soul. He has profited well in godliness, that is
able to put off that infidelity and anxiety, which is as in ou^ bones, about
things of this life, which much hinder better thoughts: thirdly, by learning to
depend upon God for these lesser things: we be lead by deg^^es to depend upon
his me^cy for the forgiveness of our sins, and other things necessary for a
heavenly life, Hos. 2.15. Ioh. 4. Psalm. 23. vlt.

Q. What is the necessity an^ equity of ^his petition?

A. We desire corporal blessings of God, first, because he is the giver of
every good gift, Iam. 1.17. he gives power to get substance, Deuteronomy. 8.18. the
blessing of the earth is from him, Hos. 2.21.22. he makes peace and war,
Esa. 45.7. he smites and heals: Magistrates and decrees of justice,
council and strength, and all other good things, are from him, Pro. 8.14.15.
Eccl. 2.26. secondly, all outward helps have their force from him, bread, has
force to nourish us from him, Pro. 29.26. and 21.31. Esa. 54.17. Hag. 1.6. Job
17.10. Psalm. 127.2. thirdly, the devil is an enemy of this earthly life, and
of the maintenance of it, it is meet therefore he be repelled by prayer:
fourthly, that we may show our selves to hate all unlawful ways of getting
our living.

Q. Show more particularly, what we are to pray for in the fourth petition.

A. First, the things whereby this life is preserved, as victuals needful for
the nourishment of the body, Psalm. 132 15. 2 Cor. 9.10. 1 Timothy 4.3.4.5. and
5.23. convenient apparel, Pro. 27.26. Gen 28.20. 1 Cor. 12.23. commodiou^
dwelling, Psalm. 107.36. Esa. 49.10 1 Cor. 4.11. Physic, Ezekiel. 47.12. Revel.
22.2. sleep, Psalm. 127.2. Hos. 2.18. peace public and private, Pro. 21.9. and
17.1. Ier. 29.7. Psalm. 144.14. and 122.6. good Magistrates, good laws, and the
execution thereof for the common wealth, Psalm. 64.2.3. for a whole mind in a
whole body, for honest fame, faithful friends, favor, especially of good men,
good marriage, as there may be occasion, Pro. 19.14. honest children, Genesis
25.21. Luk 1.13. an obedient family, good neighbors, fruitful seasons, Zach.
10.1. Act. 14.17. the strong man, the man of war, the Judge, Councellor,
Artificer, Orator, Esa. 3. secondly, for ability to do the works of our
callings, Exodus 31.3. thirdly, for willingness to undergo labors in the use
of the means, to serve Gods ordinary providence, 2 These. 3.10. 12. fourthly,
for Gods blessing upon our labor, and the means of our maintenance, Psalm.
127.1.2. Deuteronomy. 8.2.3. Pro. 10.3.22. fifthly, for a heart to use the blessings
which God gives, and for comfortable contentation with our estate, Eccl. 2.24.
1 Timothy 6.8.

Q. Why is it called Our bread?

A. First, because of a civil right and title, and so we profess against
possessing, that which is not ours, Habac. 2.6. 2 These. 3.10. secondly, by a
divine right restored in Christ, Matthew. 15.26.

Q. May we not desire riches?

A. We may desire things necessary for our nature, place, and charge, depending
on us, but not more then such necessary Pro. 39.8.9 and 23.4.5. Matthew. 13.22.
and 19.23. 1 Timothy 6.9.10.17. Psalm. 119.36. Heb. 13.5. Phil. 4.11.12. Psalm.
37.16.17.18.19. Pro. 17.1.
, yet it must not hinder diligence, upon which plenty may follow; and if God
cast abundance upon us, we may take and use it, and that even for ornament and
lawful delight, so as piety, righteousness, charity, and sobriety be kept 1
Cor. 12.23.24. Genesis 24.47. 2 Samuel 1.24. Deuteronomy. 12.20.21. Can. 37.10. Psalm.
104.15. Deuteronomy. 8.11. Luke 21.34.35.
.

Q What do we pray against in the fourth petition?

A. Against, first, famine, secondly, diseases, thirdly, wars civil, and
also foreign invasion of enemies, Psalm. 144.14. fourthly, unseasonable
weather: fifthly, negligence, and injustice in Magistrates: sixthly, falling into
the hands of extortioners: seventhly, unfaithfulness of servants,
undutifulness of children, and other such domestical adversities: eighthly,
idleness, Pro. 18.9.12.17. ninthly, unskillfulness in the works of our
calling: tenthly, G^ds withdrawing his blessing from the means of our
maintenance: eleuenthly, distrust, Mat. 6. and covetousness, Psalm. 119.36.
twelfthly, prodigality.

Q. What is further included in this fourth petition?

A. First, confession, that we have nothing of our selves, and that we are
unworthy of any thing: secondly, a th^nkefull acknowledging God to be the
giver of the things we pray for, Deuteronomy. 8. Psalm. 21.3.4.5. and 104.14.15.23.
and 18. Judge. 5. Esa. 38.16. etc. 2 Cor. 1.3.4.

Q. Concerning the fifth petition, Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
debtors, what is meant by forgiving debts or trespasses?

A. When through the satisfaction of Christ our surety, all our sins are
freely forgiven: Christ's righteousness imputed to us, and we accepted to
eternal life, Esa. 1.18. and 38.17. and 44.22. Ier. 50.20. Mic. 7.19.

Q. How do we forgive men their debts?

A. We forgive the damage concerning our selves, but as Gods Law is violated
thereby, it belongs only to God to forgive it, Leuit. 6.2. etc. Number. 5.6.
etc.

Q. How far is a man bound to forgive?

A. We must put away all enmity and grudge, that is against loving our
neighbors as our selves, Leuit. 19.17.18. Pro. 10.12.18. but satisfaction we
may sometimes require, and debts of money and the like, when the borrower is
able to pay, Exodus 22.1. etc. Luke 19.8. and sometimes the quality of the
offender is such, that he must be prosecuted to punishment, Deuteronomy. 13.8.9. and
21.18.20.21. Judge. 19.30. there is a difference between an adversary and an
enemy; the one is of hatred, the other of love of justice, an adversary may
love.

Q. Is our forgiving other men, a cause of Gods forgiving us?

A. No, but a sign or condition, without which God forgiueth not, Esa. 43.25.
Hos 14.4. Luke 6.35. 1 Ioh. 3.14. and 2.10. Matthew. 5.7. Iam. 2.13. and 3.1. and
under this particular of mercy to others, is included all repentance and
amendment of life, requisite in him, that can comfortably look for
forgiveness of sins, Exodus 34.7. Deuteronomy. 29.19.20.

Q. What is the order of this petition?

A Next after that which concerns our sustentation, we crave forgiveness of
our sins, to teach us, first, by experience of Gods goodness, in giving us
daily bread to help our weakness, in trusting in his mercy for the salvation
of our souls, Genesis 28.20.21. the wicked do not so, but after benefits say
still, Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? Job 21.14.15. secondly,
that we might learn to look for good things from God, even concerning this
life, with reconciliation and fear, or feel that when good things are kept
from us, it is sin that keeps them back from us, and separateth between
us and our God, Lam. 3.39. Ier. 5.24.

Q. What is the equity and necessity of this petition?

A. F^rst, because all men are sinners and destitute of the glory of God, 1
King. 8.46. Pro 20.9. Romans 3.23. secondly, sin separateth from God, who is
the l^^^ o^ our soul, as the soul is the life of the body: it is neces^^ry to
have that imp^d^ment of our spiritual life removed: Psalm. 40. Genesis 4. Psalm.
32.1.
thirdly, sin is an intolerable bur^hen: and bless dnesse is said to be the
lifting of a man's sins up, that they are not imputed: fourthly, sin
imputed, corrupts and destroieth the p^etious gifts of God, and ^i^ her
remoueth them from the sinner, or turns them all against him, that his table
is his snare, and his prosp^rity his ruin, Esa. 65.20. Matthew. 26.24.

Q. Seeing they that pray must with faith in Christ call God their Father,
which cannot be but with some certainty of forgiveness of sins, and seeing
in Baptism the covenant of God, for the forgiveness of all sins past,
present, and to come, is sealed to the baptized: the blood of Christ, of which
it is a figure, cleanses from all sins: what necessity is thereof this
petition?

A. First, we daily commit offense, and therefore have need daily to crave
pardon: and our assurance before hand, and always is, that pr^ier is to be
used as a means to obtain pardon: secondly, we pray for forgiveness, not
that we have no assurance th^reof, but beca^se our assurance is but weak, and
we desire greater and more comfortable assurance th^r^of, that as with God,
forgiveness is full and perfect, so the same may be accordingly sealed in our
hatts: thirdly, we pray for the obtaining of the fruit and effect of
forgiveness of sins, freedom from ^ll miseries and sorrow, and perfect
blessedness, we living now by faith and not by sight, 2 Cor. 5 7. Romans 8.23.

Q. What do we pray for in the fifth petition?

A. First, that we may know our sins, Reu. 3.17. secondly, that we may be
bumbled for them, Romans 7.24. Matthew. 11.28. thirdly, that we may confess them
to God. Pro. 28.13. fourthly, for assurance of iust^fication, Psalm. 51.1. etc.
fifthly, assurance of reconciliation with God, 2 Cor. 5.18.19. Romans 5.1. sixthly,
for charity toward men, and more generally for repentance, the sign and
condition required in them that be forgiven: seventhly, for eternal full
happiness in heaven, Romans 8.23.

Q. What do we pray against?

A. First, against ignorance of our sinful estate, Esa. 6.10. secondly,
against desperation, which Cain and Judas fell into, 1 Ioh. 5.10. thirdly,
against presumption, hardness of heart, malice, and impenitency, Psalm. 50.21.
fourthly, against damnation in hell.

Q. What is included more in this fifth petition?

A. First, a confession of sins to God Psalm. 32.4.5. Pro. 28.13. 1 Ioh. 1 8.
1 Timothy 1.15.
, and that we cannot satisfy for them: secondly, a thankful acknowledging
God only to be the author o^ forgiveness of sins, and praising him for
remission of our sins, and turning away his anger, and for his favor toward
us, Esa. 12.1. and 43.25. Mark. 2.7. Exodus 34.7. Romans 8.33. Psalm. 74.38

Q. Concerning the sixth Petition, Leade^ us not into temptation, But deliver us
from evil, what is it to be lead into temptation?

A. To be forsaken of God, left to be overcome by the temptations of Satan, our
own flesh, or the world, which move us to sin, Romans 1.24 27. Exodus ^3. and
8.15. 2 These. 2.10. Iam. 1 13.^4. Ezekiel. 14 4.9. 1 King. 22.23. Hab. 1.3. Zach 8
17.

Q. What is it to be delivered from ^ill?

A. By increasing in us the graces of ^nctification, to be set at liberty from
^he power of the devil, the world, and ^he flesh, 2 Timothy 4.18. 1 Samuel 2.9. 1
These. ^.23.24.

Q. What is the order of this petition?

A. It is according to the covenant ^f God, in the two parts of it, the first
of ^orgiuing sins, the second of giving is spirit to cause us to walk in his
sta^utes, Ezekiel. 36.25.26.27.28. therefore ^s we prayed before for forgiveness
of ^^nnes, so here for strength, that hereaf^er we be not overcome of sin,
shew^ng that it is not only the Christians ^are, to have sin forgiven, but
to re^ist temptation, and strive against sin; and these go together in time,
al^hough in order of nature, forgiveness of sins be before the strife, and
fight^ng against sin.

Q. What is the equity and necessity of this petition?

A. First, within us be inclination and motions of our own flesh: we ar^
naturally delighted with the deceitfu^ baits of sin, Job 15.16. Heb. 3.13
Tit. 3.3. and even the regenerate, although sin do not reign, yet it does
remain in them, and molest them, Rom 7.22.23.24. Gal. 5.17. secondly, we^ have
the world, out of which we be^ chosen and separated, tempting us wit^ flattery
or force, sometimes friends offering substance, liberty, etc. sometime^
frowning, changing friends into enemies, and using violence, Cant. 8.7.8.
thirdly, the devil, out of whose kingdom we be taken, has great wrath, and
labors to get us again, as he sees his endeavors to prevail with some,
that seemed to have escaped him, 2 Pet. 2.20. Revel. 12.4. he seeks to
repossesse, where once he has possessed, and to weaken the faith of some at
the least, by the falls of some, that were held great in the Church; that he
may kill ^ome, and wound others, Luke 22.32. 1 Pet. 5.8. Ephesians. 6.10.11. and this
appea^eth partly by such temptations, as be merely iniected in the minds of
the ^dly; as thoughts of blasphemy, and ^^ly by forcible suggestion, to do ^^h
things as be against reason: and to ^ch as be irksome and grievous to the
^^ture of man, as whipping, and lancing ^^e the Baalites, and offering the
chil^^en even the dearest of them to the ^uill: besides the devil labors to
^^rther the motions of the flesh, and al^ements, or other temptations of the
^orld.

Q. What do we pray for in the sixth pe^ion?

A. First, for knowledge in the word (...) God to withstand all temptations,
^phes. 6.17. Secondly, for ste^fast faith, ^phes 6.16. 1 Pet. 5.9. Thirdly, for
^erseuerance and increasing in holiness and graces, John 14. and 17. 1 John 3.9.
Pet. 1.5. Ier. 32.40. that we may con^^antly resist devilish suggestions,
saith^^lly cleave to the admonitions of the ^oly Ghost, following good
examples, and rightly using all occasions of holiness, offered of God, Psalm.
5.9. and 27.^1. and 119.117.125.144. 2 Cor. 12.^ 1 These. 3.12, 13. Fourthly,
for patience in afflictions, and power to bea^^ them, Romans 5.3. Phil. 4.11, 12,
13. 2 C^^ 10.13. Fifthly, that God will turn all a^flictions to good, that we
may be mo^^ weyned from the world, more humb^^ and obedient, etc. Psalm.
119.67.7 1 Cor. 11.31. Sixthly, for full holines^^ in heaven, Romans 8.23. 2 Pet.
3.1^ Heb. 12.22.

Q. What do we pray against?

A. First against trials and affliction themselves, so far as may stand wit^
Gods good pleasure. Secondly, against Gods desertion, that he will not forsa^^
us, or deprive us of his grace, and so against falling away from grace.
Thirdly, against hardness of heart, and reig^ing sin. Fourthly, more
generally against being overcome by the devil the world, or the flesh.

Q. What else is included in the s^^ Petition?

A. First, a confession, and bewailing of corruption remaining in us, whereby we
are prone to yield to Satan and sin, Romans 7.23, 24. 2 Cor. 12.7. Mat. 26.41
Luke 22.31. 1 These. 3.5. Secondly, a thankful ascribing to God our holiness
strength in temptation, and perseverance (...) grace, Romans 7.25. 1 Cor. 6.20. 2 Timothy ^.17. Phil. 1.6. 2 Pet. 1.5.

Q. Do we pray for all these things in all ^he petitions absolutely?

A. Such things as are not necessary ^o our salvation, we pray for
conditionally, if they stand with Gods glory, his good pleasure, and our good.

Q. How many ways does God hear ^^ens prayers?

A. First, in mercy to his children, 2 King. 20.2.5. Exo. 14 15. Mat. 26.39.
Heb. 5.7. 2 Cor. 12.8, 9.
giving that which they desire, or that which is better for them. Secondly, in
wrath, when he sends the evils which men wish upon themselves; yea, in giving
to some such prosperity as is their ruin, Psalm. 78.29, 30, 31. Mat. 27.25.

Q. Why does God sometimes defer to grant the prayers of his children?

A. First, sometime to correct them for not praying with such preparednes, and
in such manner as they ought. Secondly, the more to make the^ see their own
inability to help themselves. Thirdly, to try and exercise their faith and
patience, Mat. 15.22; 23. Fourthly, to make them esteem his benefits the more.

Q. For the third part, the conclusion, F^^ thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glo^ry for ever and ever, Amen, what is mean by kingdom, power and
glory?

1 Chro. 22 11, 12.
A. By kingdom is signified God^ sovereign right and title, to all things
with authority not only over his elect, but all things created, and that of
himself, and from himself. Power notes his force to give and work
whatsoeue^ he will. Psa. 115.3.
Glory signifies the high estimation, honor and p^aise, b^longing to him in
respect of the gifts coming from him, and of all actions performe^ by us.

Q. The reasons why these words ar^ added, and the signification of the word,
Amen, was showed in the shorter catechism, but should we use no other prayer
but this?

A. Yes we may use other prayers for form, but for matter we must have a^ eye
to this, and may fitly shut up our particular prayers in this.

Q. Are the Creed and ten Commandments to be used as prayers?

A. No, but in praying we are to crave strength to believe, that which is
contained in the Commandments.

Q. Is not the doctrine of the Papists in ^any things against the Creed, the
ten Commandments, the Lords prayer, and the ^octrine of the Sacraments?

A. Yes.

Q. Wherein? name some particulars, 1 Ioh. 5.21. Reu. 17.14. 2 These. 2. Reu. 18
4.
for ^t were too long to name all, yet it is meet to ^^me some, that ^e may
know, we must constantly stand on Christ's side against the Devil and all
Antichristian errors and heresies, and know that so many martyrs have ^ot
without cause constantly withstood Pa^istrie: begin therefore to show how their
doctrine is against the Creed.

A. Against the first Article, yea and ^ll the rest, Ioh. 1.12. G^l. 2.20. 1
Ioh. 4.16. and 5.13, 14.15.
is their denying of particular ^aith, which is required in all the Ar^icles.
Also their defining of faith, to ^ee no more but a firm assent of the mind to
the whole truth of God, which ^aith the devils have. Pro. 19.2.
And also they commend an implicit faith, to believe ^s the Church believes,
not knowing what the Church is or what it belee^eth.

Against the second Article, Heb. 7.^5. Act. 4.12.
whereas jesus is a perfect Savior of his people, from all their sins and
punishments, they ascribe associates to Christ, as the Virgin Mary, St.
Francis, the Popes pardon, our own merits, etc. and whereas the title Christ
signifies our Savior to be the Prophet, 1 Ioh. 2.22. Esa. 42.8. and 43.25.
Priest and King of his Church, and will not give his honer to others, but is
the only Messiah; against his prophetical office, they have men's traditions;
against his Priesthood they have their Mass, and the mediation and
intercession of Saints by their prayers and merits; and against his kingly
office, they say the Pope can make laws to bind men's consciences, and may make
new Articles of faith, and dispense with the old and new Testament; some of
these errors are also against the six^ and other Articles of the Creed.

Against the third, they hold the humanity of Christ to be in many place^ at
once, and by consequence deny him to be true man.

Heb. 1.3. and 7.27. and 10.14.
Against the fourth, whereas Christ suffered to purge away our sins alone b^
himself, by his one sacrifice once offered: they hold purging of sins by
(...) new sacrifice unbloody, which ouerturneth the foundation of remission of
^innes by Christ's sacrifice once offered: Heb. 9.22. 1 Ioh. 1.7. Romans 3.25.
and unbloody differs in substance from Christ's, where blood was not
accidental; and it argues the first to be ^neffectuall, by renewing it. And
they ^erre in the doctrine of Gods justice, saying it may be satisfied with
men's poe^all works, as if it were not infinite; Gal. 3.10. Romans 6.23.
and they hold some sins not to be ^amnable. Also they err in the doc^rine
of repentance by humane satisfac^ions to God, and also such confession,
^ontrition and satisfaction, as they make ^arts of repentance may be without
saying faith.

Against the sixth and seventh, and also against some other Articles is their
er^our of transubstantiation. For if Christ ^e a true man, borne of the Virgin
Ma^^, be ascended into heaven, and there ^o be contained until the end of the
world, Act. 1.11. and 3.21.
when he shall come to judge the ^uicke and the dead, he cannot be made ^f
bread, and present bodily at the Mass, and in many places at once. Ier. 17.5.


Against the ninth, they deny men to ^e Saints until they be dead, and so rob
them of their communion with the Saints.

Against the tenth and many of the rest, they trust in their works for
salvation, holding their own merits, and humane satisfactions, Rom 3 24, 28.
Ephesians. 2.8, 9, 10.
and justification by works.

Q. How is their doctrine against the te^^ Commandments?

A. Against the first, by maintaining ignorance to be the mother of devotion,
and by calling the Pope God, an^ saying he can make holy the unholy and
justify the wicked, Mat. 22.29
and dispens^^ with the law of nature, and with th^^ Prophets and Apostles; and
calling the virgin Mary a goddess, their hope, an^ the Queen of Heaven,
having pow^^ to command her Son; and also callin^ the wodden cross their hope.

Exodus 32.5. Hos 2.16. Hab. 2.18, 19. Mat. 4.10. Psalm. 50.15. Exo. 22.20
Against the second, by making im^ges of God, and also of creatures for
r^ligious uses and worship. Also they ^dore and pray to Saints, and Angell^ and
burn tapers, and build temples, an^ altars, and consecrate days to them, an^
they worship the bread in the sacrame^^ and yet know nor the intention of the
Priest, who if he intended not consecr^tion, it is not Christ according to
their doctrine: howsoever the bread is not to be adored. Also they make vows
to creatures, and fasting meritorious, and their merits are against Gods
showing mercy to thousands of them that love him, and keep his Commandments.

Against the third, they dishonor God by keeping the scriptures and prayers in
an unknown tongue, and by calling the virgin Mary all in all, and by holding
equivocations in oaths, and that one is not bound to such oaths as the Pope
dispenses with: and swearing by creatures; also by holy water; and either they
do or have baptized bells.

Against the fourth, they hold many festival days to the saints to be
observed with as much solemnity as the sabbath or Lords day.

Against the fifth, Romans 13.1. 1 King. 2.26, 27.
they hold the Pope and Clergy not to be subject to Kings and Princes, and that
the Pope may depose Kings: also they allow marriages and monastical vows,
without and against the consent of their wise and careful parents.

Against the sixth, they say that subjects may kill their King being
excommunicated by the Pope; and they hold men may be saved by the merit of
their works, Ier. 17.5.
and so bring the curse and murder of souls.

Leu. 21. Matt. 8.14. 1 Timothy 3. Lev. 18.
Against the seventh, they forbid marriage to the Clergy, and maintain the vow
of single life, although there be not the gift of continency, and defend the
toleration of Stews, and marriages within the degrees forbidden in the
Scriptures.

Against the eight, they sell remission of sins and merits of others, and get
money and lands unlawfully by such means.

Against the ninth, they hold jesting and officious lies not to be damnable,
and that equivocations may be used, and faith not to be kept with heretics,
and they corrupt and falsify men's works.

Against the tenth, they hold lust without consent, and concupiscence in the
regenerate to be no sin.

Q. How against the Lord Prayer?

A. First, against the Preface, by praying to Saints, and making them
mediators, whereas we are to pray to the Father in the name and mediation of
Christ only. Also they deny particular faith, but how can he say our Father,
that does not know God is his Father. Secondly, against the first petition, by
idolatry, and among the rest, ascribing to Saints that honor which belongs
to God. Thirdly, against the second petition, by keeping the Scriptures and
prayers in an unknown tongue, and by false doctrine, and false sacraments, and
persecuting such be the true worshippers of God. Fourthly, against the third
petition, by holding freedom of will and power in themselves, and by
themselves, to do the will of God. Fifthly, against the fourth petition, by
merits, if we must ask daily bread to be given, we cannot deserve heaven by
our works. Sixthly, against the fifth petition by humane satisfactions, merits,
ability to fulfill the law, and by holding, that the fault being forgiven, the
punishment may be retained: and their denying particular faith is against that
clause, As we forgive our debtors. Seventhly, against the sixth petition by
denying perseverance in grace. Eighthly, against the word, Amen, by denying
particular faith, and holding prayers in an unknown tongue. 1 Cor. 14.19.


Q. How against the Sacraments?

A. First, by holding seven sacraments. Secondly, by saying sacraments confer
grace of the work wrought without any goodness in the receiver. Thirdly, by
holding children dying without Baptism remain for ever in a dungeon, and be
not saved. Fourthly, by saying that the wicked may receive the very body and
blood of Christ. Fifthly, by reserving the bread in a box, and carrying it
about, without receiving it. Sixthly, by holding transubstantiation which is
against the institution of Christ, who took the bread, brake it, delivered it,
and said, Do this in remembrance of me, till I come, therefore he meant not
to be bodily present. Seventhly, in that they deliver not the wine to the
people, as the Apostles did.

A Thanksgiving or Grace before meat.
GOod Lord forgive us our sins, and give us the graces of thy holy spirit,
and as thou have provided food for our bodies, give us (we pray thee,) a
sober and wholesome use thereof, that we may be more fit for thy service,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

A Thanksgiving or Grace after meat.
THy holy name be praised O Lord, for that thou have fed us at thi^ time, and
from time to time with thy good creatures, especially for our redemption by
Jesus Christ. Give us grace (we pray thee) to serve thee in holiness and
righteousness before thee all the days of our life: and bless with us thy
whole Church, preserve and direct our King, and other Rulers, comfort the
afflicted, grant thy Gospel and peace more and more to flourish, through Jesus
Christ our Lord, Amen.

O Eternal, Almighty, The Preface.
and only wise God, thou, even thou art Lord alone, thou have made heaven, the
heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are
therein, and thou preseruest them all, and the host of heaven worshippeth
thee, thou art the great and terrible God, that keep covenant and mercy, for
them that love thee, and endeavor to observe thy commandments. Thou have
promised that such as have access to the throne of thy grace, shall find
mercy, and that if we confess our sins with a detestation of them, thou are
faithful and just to forgive them all. O Lord let thine ear now be
attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou may hear the prayer of thy
servants, and forgive all our sins. Behold, Confession of sins.
we were conceived and borne in sin, and by nature could not at all conceive
the things of God, which are spiritually discerned. Our carnal wisdom is
enmity with thee, and before our calling, we drunk up iniquity like water,
all the imaginations of the thoughts of our hearts were evil only, and
continually, we rebelled against all thy holy Commandments, and cast them
behind our backs, we were strangers from the life of God, and enemies to
thee. When we were thus wallowing in pollution and wickedness; it pleased thee
in unspeakable mercy to seek us, and to reveal thy self gracious to us,
through Jesus Christ thy beloved Son, and to call us, and to enter into
covenant with us; and yet have we sinned very unthankfully and unkindly, and
have transgressed all thy Commandments, and are yet full of ignorance, worldly
sorrow, distrustful and carnal fear, earthly mindedness, pride, impatience,
self-love. We have not considered thy all-filling presence, not trembled at
thy judgments, nor been thankful for thy benefits, as we ought; and thus we
have sinned every day, in every place we have lived, in every age and condition
of our life; we are in respect of these sins and many more, often multiplied
against thee, most vile and wretched sinners, ashamed to lift up our eyes, or
to look up to thee: we have provoked the eyes of thy glory; we have deserved
all thy punishments in this world, and hellfire in the world to come. But most
gracious Lord, Petition for forgiveness of sins.
who art the Father of mercies, and God of all consolation, enter not into
judgment with thy servants: O Lord forgive and take away all iniquities,
transgressions and sins, and receive us graciously; cast all our sins into
the bottom of the sea, and look upon us through Christ, whom thou have sent
forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood, and have consecrated
him to be the author of eternal salvation to all that obey him. Give us grace
to believe, help our unbelief, say to our souls, thou art our salvation; and
seeing thou iustifiest none but whom thou sanctifiest: and also it were great
unthankfulness to desire forgiveness of sin, with a purpose to live
impenitently: we pray thee, cause us to bewail our sins with a godly sorrow,
Petition for repentance and sanctification.
grieuing for them more then for any other crosses; and O Lord, heal our
natures, mortify and crucify our sins, that the vigor and force of them may
daily decay and be wasted. Teach us to deny all ungodliness, and worldly
lusts, and to live righteously, soberly, and godly in this present evil world:
quicken us, and renew us after thine own image, in righteousness and true
holiness: enable us to serve thee, in our general and particular callings,
keeping our consciences void of offense toward God and toward men, that our
lights may so shine before men, that they may see our good works, and glorify
thee our heavenly Father. Petition for increase of grace.
Cause us to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, to forget those things which are behind, and to reach forth unto those
things which are before, pressing toward the mark, for the prize of the high
calling of God in Christ Jesus. And for perseverance.
Cause us also to persevere and to hold out to the end; thou have sufficient
grace to begin and to finish, to prevent, assist and excite us. Enable us we
pray thee, to continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and not moved away
from the hope of the Gospel. Stablish us in every good word and work, that we
may fight the good fight, finish our course, and run out our race. And
although we be unworthy to pray for our selves, yet seeing thou have commanded
us to pray one for another, and promised to hear us through Christ; we pray
thee be favorable to thy Sion, Prayer for others.
build the walls of thy Jerusalem; yea, bless all thy people, both among Jews
and Gentiles; grant thy Gospel a more free passage for the gathering of the
Saints; bless Magistrates, and such as be in authority, that they may be of
courage, fearing thee, hating Popery and all idolatry, atheism and
covetousness, and dealing justly; especially our King, and other rulers in
this land, that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all godliness and
honesty: bless the Ministers of thy holy Word and Sacraments, that they may
have gifts for the work of the Ministry, use of their gifts, and success of
their labors, for the converting of such as be ordain^^g to life by the
ordinary means; the speaking of a word in season to the wearied soul, and to
the conuincing of gaine-sayers: also we humbly pray thee to comfort thy
servants that be in any affliction of body or mind, give them wisdom,
constancy and patience, give the issue with the temptation, turn all to them
for good, lay no more upon them, then thou will enable them to bear, and in
thy due time glorify thy name in their deliverance; give them beauty for
ashes, and the oil of gladness for mourning and heaviness: bless also our
friends, and them that bless us, yea also our enemies, and them that curse and
hate us; turn them unto thee that are curable, and overthrow all the plots and
devices whereby the devil or man any way works against thy Church.
Thanksgiving.
And we give thee humble and hearty thanks in that weak measure as we are
able, for thy benefits bestowed upon us this night past, and safely bringing us
hither to this day, and for all thy blessings from our birth and infancy to
this present: yea for choosing us in Christ, before the foundations of the
world were laid, and for preventing and keeping us from many sins, that else
we had fallen into; and sparing us from many judgments which our sins have
deserved; yea for justifying and pardoning us through Christ, and for redeeming
and ransoming us from the devil, sin, death and hell; and that not with
silver or gold, or any corruptible thing, but by the precious blood of Christ:
also for giving us the first fruits of the spirit, and some love of thy Law,
and some desire to have our nature and life conformable to the same; whereas
else we might have cast thy Laws behind our backs, as they that perish; and
for adopting us to an inheritance immortal and undefiled, and that fades not,
reserved in heaven for us. We praise thee also for thy manifold blessings
concerning this present life, preserving us from many dangers and calamities,
and heaping many benefits upon us; it is thy great mercy, that the little
flock of thy sheep and lambs, is preserved from being made a prey to the
devil and his adherents, which are as Lions and Woolfes. We pray thee,
preserve us still, and lead us by thy spirit, that we may live and dye in
faith and obedience to thee. Hear us we beseech thee, and grant these things
which we have prayed for, and whatsoever else thou know needful for us, or
any other members of thy Church, for the alsufficient merits of thy beloved
Son, in whom thou art well pleased, in whose name we conclude our petitions,
as himself has taught us, saying, Our Father, etc.

A Prayer for the Evening.
The Preface.
O Eternal and Almighty Lord God, which have stretched forth the heavens, and
laid the foundations of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him, who
only know the hearts of all the children of men; thy name is a strong
tower, the righteous runs into it, and is safe. We humbly confess that
thou made us righteous, and able to keep all thy laws, in out first
creation in Adam, but we found out many inneutions, and made our selves unable
to do any good thing, yea, to think a good thought, by our own power in our
corrupted ^state. We came into the world, defiled with original sin, as much
as any other, and the same sin still hangs fast upon us, and is not yet
abolished; and from the same, as from a most impute fountain and bitter root,
have proceeded many actual sins, more in number then the hairs of our heads:
we have broken all thy holy commandments, in thought, word and deed: whereas
we owe duties to thee, and ought to trust in thee, to love thee with a zealous
love, to fear thee who art Almighty, and every where present, and know our
secret thoughts; we ought also to call upon thee, to be thankful to thee, to
be patient, and to humble our selves under thy mighty hand; besides these and
many more duties to be performed by us to thee; we also for conscience of thy
commandment, owe duties to our selves and other men, superiors, equals and
inferiors to us, and in all these respects, we have sinned more ways then we
can remember or know; our thoughts should always have been chaste holy, and
righteous, our words gracious, our actions agreeable to thy word; but we have
omitted duties commanded, committed sins forbidden, and failed in the
performance of the best works that ever we have done: we have not profited in
the knowledge of thy will, answerable to our time, and the helps we have
inioyed for that purpose; the means to come by knowledge have been ve^
negligently used of us, we have been unthankful and unkind to thee; who have
a long time given us thy glorious Gospel, with peace and plenty. Moreover, we
have not so tamed our corrupt nature, and so set our selves against the same,
and the devil and the world, as we ought, but have favored exceedingly, and
given too much liberty to our selves, loving fond ease, and loathing to take
pains in running the race of Christianity; we have misspent a great deal of
precious time, in that we have not spent it to thy glory, the edification of
others, or providing for our own souls; our eyes and minds have been so set
on these present things below, that we cannot lift them up to the high and
excellent things that concern thy Kingdom, nor nourish our delight and joy in
the benefit of redemption, and assurance of effectual calling as we ought:
we have little feeling of the wants and miseries of others, to see how many
walk ignorantly; other, many in security, hypocrisy, superstition and other
sins, many also in diseases and painful troubles of body and mind. We have
looked too narrowly upon bad examples, and neglected good: thus vile we are,
and more then we are able to express: all our sins are mortal and damnable,
being committed against thine infinite Majesty, and thine holy and undefiled
word. We have grieved thy good spirit, whereby we are sealed to the day of our
redemption: we are unworthy to breathe in the air, or to tread on the earth,
but worthy to be left to our selves, and to the malice of Satan, to heap up
wrath against the day of wrath, and the declaration of thy just judgment. But
seeing that thou so louedst the world, that thou gave thine only begotten
Son, that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have life
everlasting; and seeing he has cancelled the handwriting and bond which was
against us, and thou have given him to be made unto us, wisdom,
righteousness, sanctification and redemption, and that if we should despair,
we should dishonor thee, and give advantage to the enemies of our salvation;
We pray thee, enable us to glorify thee, by believing that our sins are
forgiven. Good Lord wash away our crimson and scarlet red sins, with the
precious blood of Christ, that we may be as white as wool, and as snow: that
thou may see no iniquity, and behold no transgression in us: set our sins
as far from us, as the East is from the West: and seeing thou do justify
none by the merits of our Savior, but whom thou do sanctify by the
efficacy and virtue of his precious death, and glo^ious resurrection; yea, and
seeing it were heinous unthankfulness to desire remission of sins, and to
live wickedly; we pray thee, cause us to be sorry for our sins, with a godly
sorrow, and to testify our sorrow by a care to avoid sin, and the occasions
thereof, and to do holy duties in a holy manner, embracing the occasions of
the same: and by apology: and herein we pray thee, enable us to confess our
sins, and to crave pardon, that we may be assured thou do absolve and acquit
us from all our sins: Moreover, give us indignation against our sins and
ourselves, by reason of them; saying to them, get them hence, what have we to
do with them any more: also work in us a godly fear, and desire, draw us,
and we will run after thee, and cause us to testify our repentance, by a
zeal of thy glory, that the coals of our love to thee, may be fiery coals,
and a vehement flame: and by revenge, offering violence to sin, resisting and
striving against, especially such sins as we are most inclined to. Sanctify
us throughout, our minds, that we may know thee to be the only true God, and
whom thou have sent, Jesus Christ: purge our consciences from dead works, to
serve thee the living God: write thy laws in our hearts and minds, cause us to
observe and do them; set a watch before our lips, that we offend not with
our tongues, but that we may be an humble people of a pure language, serving
thee with one consent, hating lying, swearing, and all evil speaking: turn
away our eyes from beholding vanity, direct our steps in thy word, and let
none iniquity have dominion over us: cause us to give all diligence, to make
our calling and election sure, by faith in thy promises, and by adding to our
faith, virtue, shining in a gracious course of life among men; and to virtue,
knowledge, seeing without knowledge we can do nothing well; and to knowledge,
temperance, avoiding curiosity, riotousnesse, and wantonness; and to
temperance, patience, quietly, willingly, and constantly subiecting our selves
to thy holy providence, in afflictions, coming either immediately from thy
holy hand, or from men, although they wrong us thereby: and to patience,
godliness, by a zealous worshipping of thee; and to godliness, brotherly
kindness, showed to the household of faith in a special manner; and to
brotherly kindness love, even to our enemies. Cause us to purge our selves
from all pollution, both of flesh and spirit, and to grow up to full holiness
in the fear of thy name; that as our salvation is nearer, then when we first
believed it, so our faith, repentance, and new obedience may be more. Enable us
to put on and wear the whole armor of God, that we may stand fast; the
girdle of truth against all hypocrisy and falsehood, the breastplate of
righteousness against all unrighteous and evil ways, the shoes of peace
assured of our reconciliation with thee, against troubles, the shield of faith
against doubting, the helmet of hope against fainting, and the sword of the
spirit, thy holy word, against all error and ignorance. O knit our hearts for
ever to thee, that we may fear thy name, and so live, as to glorify thee, to
win others to thee, and to prove our faith to be lively and true, that so we
may rejoice in the Lord, and lift up our faces before the Almighty: and we
pray thee to grant the same blessings, that we have craved for our selves, to
al thy people according to their necessities and conditions. Grant thy Gospel
a free passage throughout all nations where thou have appointed to gather thine
elect by the ordinary means. Bless Kings and Magistrates, that they may be
nurses to thy Church. Cause them to serve thee with fear, and to rejoice with
trembling: especially we beseech thee to bless our King and other Rulers in
this land, that true religion may flourish, popery and superstition, and all
profaneness, and wickedness, more and more rooted out. Bless the Ministers
of thy word, it is thy will to convey heavenly treasures in earthen vessels,
and although the word seem to worldly men to be foolishness, and as weak as
the trumpets used in the overthrow of Jericho, yet make it thy power to the
salvation of thy people, to the conuincing of gaine-sayers. Forgive the sins
of this land and other lands, where thy name is called upon, and give
repentance to them that yet live swearing, drunkenness, oppression,
wantonness, contempt of thy word, and such other grievous sins that make the
land to mourn. Purge thy Church, that it may be fair as the moon, Purge as
the sun, and terrible as an army with banners. Comfort also we pray thee, the
afflicted with sickness, poverty, wars, trouble of conscience, or any other
adversity distressed, according to the multitude of their sorrows, let thy
consolations refresh their souls: bless them also that we are bound to by
nature, charge, desert, or any other bond, and those that pray for us, or have
desired our prayers. And we desire to praise thy holy name, and in that weak
measure as we are able, we give thee humble and hearty thanks, for our
election, redemption, vocation, justification, measure of sanctification, and
hope of glorification, and also for all the blessings whereby this present life
has been the more comfortable to us: an^ grant that this may be the chief
end of all our petitions, that we may more cheerfully serve thee, and that
our love may not be a self-love, but that we may labor to prefer thy
glory, before our own salvation, and be grieved that we have so much
self-love in us; and finally, as thou have graciously protected us this day
past, for which we praise thy name, so we pray thee to preserve us this night;
keep us from wicked dreams, and from all dangers; let thy watchful
providence compass us about, and thine Angels defend us; grant us such
refreshing by rest and sleep, that if it please thee to give us more time in
this world, we may be the more cheerful and fit for thy service; and keep
our souls awake and watchful, that at our dissolution, they may be carried by
the Angels to heaven, and that when we shall awake at the last day, we may be
satisfied with thine image. Hear us in these things, and whatsoever else thou
know needful for us, or any of thine, for the merits of thy beloved Son
in whom thou art well pleased: to whom with thee, and the holy spirit, be all
honor and glory, dominion and power, ascribed of us and the whole Church, from
this time forth, and for evermore, Amen.

FINIS.
