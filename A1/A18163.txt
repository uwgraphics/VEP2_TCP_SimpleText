our conuersations.

which as an instrument it is wrought. ^ct. 5.31.2 37. Tim. 2.25

this life and hell hereafter, and the punishment he laid on Christ, as also
thought of his mercy in pardoning sin if we repent.

Q. What is the fifth thing in worthy receiving?

and peace and love to our neighbors.

A. God here seals his love to us, 1 Cor. 10 17. Mat. 5.23.24. 1 Timothy 2.8.
and seals our union one with another, it is a love feast, besides no service
is accepted which is not done in love.

Q. What is love?

A. A gracious affection of the heart whereby we wish and endeavor good to all
especially to the godly. Gal. 5.22. 1 Cor. 13. Gal. 6.10.

Cor. 13.4 5.6.7. Romans 12.1^ 1 Pet. 4.8. Gal. 5.22.


Q. How shall we attain this love?

A. By prayer, for it is a fruit of the spirit.

Q. What must we do if there be any breach of love between us and others?

A. Seek reconciliation and not omit the Sacrament. Mat. 5.23.24:


Q. What if reconciliation cannot be had?

A. If it be truly sought for on our part we are safe it is our own not others
malice which makes us unfit for the Sacrament. 1 Cor. 11.28.


Q. What if they have provoked us and made no satisfaction?

A. Yet we must forgive and not desire revenge, Col. 3.12.13.
Christ must be our rule who forgave us freely.

Q. What is the last thing necessary in preparation?

A. A purpose to keep that Covenant which we made in Baptism, and now renew
in the Lords Supper.

Q, Why is this necessary?

A. Because without this a man mocks God making show of covenanting with him
but thinks of nothing less, and this purpose of new obedience is a necessary
fruit of faith. ^^m. 2.17.


Q, How may we know whether we have this purpose?

A. Our consciences are the only witnesses in this, when we make a covenant
with a man we know whether we mean to keep it so may we in our covenant
with God.

Q. What helps may we have in attaining this?

A. We must consider if our purposes be sincere Christ will help us to keep
them, accept sincere though weak service and give us an inestimable reward,
Cor. 8.12. Mat. 25.34.
so it will be the best bargain that can be made.

Q. What if we find not this qualification?

A. If we have it not in some measure, 1 Cor. 11.^8.
we must seek it before we presume to come to the Lords Table, there be
degrees in it the more preparation the more fruit.

Q. What is the danger of unworthy receiving?

A. Very great, for instead of having benefit by Christ's blood, 1 Cor. 11.21.29.
we are guilty of it and make our selves liable to temporal and eternal
judgments.

Q. Is it not best then to omit this Sacrament?

A. No absenting from the Sacrament is no better, Mat 22.3.7 Heb. 10.25.
nor safer then the profaning of it.

Q. What must we then do if we find want of preparation?

A. Lament our wants and desire and endeavor after these graces and we shall
be accepted. Mat. 5.6. 2 Cor. 8.12. 2 Chronicles. 30.19.


Q. If we have once been prepared may we be afterward secure?

A. No, 1 Cor. 11.30.31.
we must prepare a new for there are required not only the habits of these
graces but renewed acts so them.

Q. What demeanor is required of us in receiving?

A. Such reverence as becomes the Table of so great a God.

Q. What else?

A. We must have our minds set on work by the signs to meditate on the thing
signified, and with joy remember the sufferings of Christ and apply them.

Q. What must we do after participation?

A. We must give thanks to God for vouchsafing us to be his guests at his
table as we give thanks after an ordinary meal.

Q. What is to be done else?

A. We must remember our covenant with God and strive to keep it.

Q. What else?

A. We must examine and consider whether we profit by the Sacrament or not.

Q. What if a man be worse after it?

A. If he be so indeed, then he has eaten unworthily and must be humbled.

Q. What if we find benefit by the Sacrament? 1 Cor. 11.31.


A. We must be very thankful and greatly rejoice, Ioh. 6.33.35.
for Christ is the bread of life: he that once eats of Christ spiritually
shall be sure to be nourished to eternal life, he may be sick in his soul
but he shall never die.
