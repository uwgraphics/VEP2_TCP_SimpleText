TO THE QUEEN.
MADAME,
IT cannot be presumption to present That, Which to detain were Sacrilege. my
Plea is, I Durst not but Bring the Letters, which HEAVEN Sends: It endites,
what Earth writes; in THIS most specially, Which it has Signed, with its own
Hand; and Sealed, with its own Signet: Yet, if unacquainted with its Hand, I
mistake the Superscription, and present it amiss; my Hope is, Such Royal
Goodness, may yet Pardon,

MADAME, Your Majesty's most Humble Servant I. S.

The Several Scenes, Antimasques, and Entries, in This Device of HEAVEN.
THE GENERAL SCENE, is the LITTLE WORLD, or Isle of BRITAIN; centred within
the Spears of Heaven. page 1.

The GREAT QUEEN being seated under a Royal State, a Cloud rising, brings up
the First Scene: A Scene of Darkness, Nightwork, Thunder, Lightning, with all
Attendants of Storm and Tempest.

NIGHT enters in a hideous shape, holding a Landscape of Horror, inscribed in a
strange Dialect (to cause more Admiration) SKOTOS Signifying Darkness.
: But soaring up too near the State, is amazed at such a Majesty; and, as
dazzled with that unexpected Brightness, is forced to retire in most confused
haste; in which She lost two of Her Attendants, SILENCE and OBLIVION: Which
were still retained behind Her, as Foyles to grace the following Scene of
glorious Brightness, rising up like a clear Day, dawning out of blackest
Clouds. p. 3, 4.

In this Scene, Two Celestial HEROINS Astronomia and Astrologia.
descend from the Spears; Presenting the Plot of the Masque, to the GREAT
QUEEN; with a Petition inviting Her, to vouchsafe Her presence to the HERO'S
of Heaven, now ready to attend Her, whose Beauty might supply the want of
PHOEBUS Rays, who was already Masked within the Sphe^^, expecting Her presence.
page 4.

These two, re-ascending in a glorious Rainbow, Sing the first Song to the
GREAT QUEEN: who, rising up in a Rosy colored Cloud, was presently seen,
Entering among the Masquers, personating PHEBE; and at the end of the Masque,
was again seen with Her Royal PHOEBUS under the State; while a Celestial
Cho^us enters singing, and concludes the Masque. page 19.

The Plot of the Masque (presented by ASTRONOMIA and ASTROLOGIA) consists of
two Parts, or Maps: The one Celestial, the other Terrestrial.

The Celestial Map This Map is fully represented in the Masque Unmasked.
, is a most true and exact draught o^ the Site and Motions of the SUN, MOON,
VENUS, SATURN, MERCURY, JUPITER and MARS; with other Heavenly Bodies, through
the years, 1639, 1640, etc.

The Terrestrial Map, is truly to represent, How all Those Motions were
shadowed upon Earth, for all That time. But, this last Map (or History) is not
yet fully perfected, because the exact proportion 'twixt Heaven and Earth, is
not yet concluded on, by the best ASTRONOMERS.

The Celestial and Terrestrial Maps, shadowed Both together in one
compendious Scheme; being an Epitomy of the following Masque.
PHOEBUS, pleasing to bless the Southern World with his Chiefest Residence,
deputes MERCURY to the Northern THULE Of this THVLE; as of Saturn and M^rc^ries
Right to it; and quar^ell for it^ a^e large Note^, both in the Margents of the
Masque, and after the Masque.
; but SATURN (having pre-possession) drives MERCURY back, from THULE. This
Quarrel is shadowed in the Antimasque of Night-work, inscribed SKOTOS. page 3.

MARCH 1639. APRIL 1639. MAY 1639.
MERCURY imploreth PHOEBUS; Who, in much Goodness, condescendeth to take a
Northern Progress toward THULE, to reconcile these Two; yet, lest They should
prove Contumacious, He advances in Warre-like manner; attended with JUPITER,
MARS, and all their Satellites. page 9.

JUNE.
But PHEBE'S Royal Goodness vouchsafes to Mediate Peace; which PHOEBUS
grants to his Dearest PHEBE: and so, SATURN and MERCURY are again settled by
PHOEBUS in their proper Places.

Only MARS, is Enemy to This Peace, and by diverse assayes, Labors to break
it. But, PHEBE still opposes Him; and so prevails, that MARS Falls down as
Thunderstruck; yielding himself Prisoner to PHOEBUS.

JULY.
PHOEBUS returns again (leading MARS a Captive-Prisoner) to His wonted Southern
Residence; to the content and Joy of All. page 12.13.

At His Return, VENUS petitioneth for Her old Friend MARS, and begg^th His
Liberty; which at length, AUGUST.
PHOEBUS grants, in much Royal Goodness; which (to all ingenuous Noble
Spirits) is a Bond, much more Strong, then any Chain, then any Fetter.

MARS released (being more enraged at His Imprisonment) Plots to incense SATURN
and MERCURY again; Throu^h the ^est of 1639 and great Part o^ 1640.
and after diverse assayes, at length prevails so far, that SATURN begins
again to frown on MERCURY: which MARS so foments, that, ere long, MERCURY is
again driven out of THULE, and forced to re-implore PHOEBUS.

PHOEBUS condescendeth to take a Second Progress toward THULE: 1640.
yet resolving, rather to prevail with gentle Rays of wonted Goodness, then
by Thunderbolts.

But PHEBE again vouchsafes to interpose Her self; prevailing with PHOEBUS,
SEPTEMBER.
to summon His Grand Council of all the Seeming Deities. page 14.

Who meeting in AREOPAGUS M^rs-Hill. S^e ^he Ma^gin^ll N^tes. p^g 1.
, jointly agree to Arraigne MARS, for rebelling against PHOEBUS; disturbing the
Peace mediated by PHEBE; incensing SATURN, and with him jointly opposing
MERCURY.

MARS thus arraigned, was Cast, by joint consent, of all the Deities; and
adjudged to forfeit all His Honors, Dignities, Privileges, etc. to His
Sovereign PHOEBUS; and for ever to be excluded from the Number of Gods.

PHOEBUS Returns again to His wonted Southern Residence, OCTOBER.
in Great glory: while PHEBE still condescendeth to mediate a perfect Peace;
for which, Her Royal Goodness p^evaileth with PHOEBUS, to continue His Great
Council; and to summon all the CAUSES into JUPITERS HALL, the Great
Councell-Place for all the Gods. NOVEMB^R, etc.


Here, SATURN and MERCURY resign up all Their Possessions, Claims, etc. into
PHOEBUS Hands, acknowledging Their dependence on His Royal Favor.

PHOEBUS receives them with wonted Goodness; Which alone moves Him not only
to re-invest them with all Former Privileges; but also to smile on them with
new addition of Royal Favors; well knowing, that Royal Goodness, is still
wont to Find, or Make, Loyal Subjects of all Noble Spirits. page 16.

Thus at length, is a most Happy Peace effected through the whole LITTLE WORLD:
at which all the CAUSES jointly petition, for an Eternal Memorial of the
Royal Goodness of PHOEBUS and His Royal PHEBE.

Who (after a Bright Cloud of thin Exhalations had opened it self and
disappeared) are Both seen resting under the Royal State; to the greatest
content and Joy of All. Witnessed by a General Applause, first begun among all
the Deities in Heaven; and being thence reflected through the whole Scene, was
again counter-echoed by all the Spears.

Whence issues a Celestial Chorus singing, and congratulating the most Happy
Peace, and Union of the Little World, made by the Royal Goodness of PHOEBUS,
and His Royal PHEBE.

MASQUERADE DU CIEL: Presented to the Great Queen of the LITTLE WORLD.
THE SCENE was centred within a circle of Magnifique Portico's, THE SPEARS of
HEAVEN, and GLOBE of EARTH.
all fairly Vaulted; yet so artificially poyzed with such curious Proportion,
that without pressure, They supported their Supporters; Which seemed Silver
Pilasters, inter-veyn'd with Streaming Sprigs of finest Gold. Over these, ran
an Architrave Freez; yet shooting up so far from the eye, that it lost
somewhat of its luster, and seemed but Pearl, filleted with sparkles of
richest Diamonds. The outward Balcon's, for fenestello's had a continued
Crystal Work, backed with a most glorious prospect, which quickly lost the
eye, midst Orient Colors, streamed with Azure, at greatest distance.

Within These, was a stately Fabric, curiously couched into a Sphere;
intermixtly waved with four Elements; and foiled about with a Perspective of
Clouds; over which, at distance, NATURE hovered, with an aspect that seemed to
admire, rather then view, Arts choice Composure.

On This, a Curious Balestrata, finely raised; seeming a LITTLE WORLD Rising up
from within a Greater: THE LITTLE WORLD, or ISLE of BRITAIN.
The Great Globe's Epitomy: Natures Second Draught; at which She smiled to see
her self grown an Artist, in more complete Limning; For, Her Former lines
seemed but as imperfect Assayes, of what she meant to draw in This; Her
Masterpiece of all, which with a modest scorn, seemed to disdain all
Admiration. Its utmost Verge, was an Artificial Border, made of a Natural
Sea; most lively expressed flowing into a Circle; whose in-most Area, (seeming an
Island of Mosaique Work, Terrast with antic knots) was the Basis to a Royal
State, blessed with the Presence of the GREAT QUEEN.

Over whom, ran a most glorious Canopy; in which the Graces were seen, each
with her silver needle, Enameling rather then Embroyd'ring: and so neatly were
the Flowers contrived, that with humble reverence they All inclined to the
GREAT QUEEN, (as the Heliotropion to the Sun) seeming to acknowledge their
Color to Her Lip, their Sweetness to Her Breath.

Toward the Fringe, the Graces met; and with a pleasant smile, all at once
reflected on the last made (but first intended) Flower, finely purled with
BRITTANNOCLEA ^^^tain^^ ^lory.
; which was the Soul to This Body, the Motto impres'd on This Device of HEAVEN.

The Color most in Eye, was the Rosie-Lilly-sweetly-mixt Carnation; yet
changeably inclining toward Crimson, which seemed but a Natural modest Blush,
at the presence of the GREAT QUEEN: Who sat Circled about with a Glory of
Rays; which yet needed not to express Her, Whom all knew the QUEEN of
glorious Brightness: The fairest Idea of perfect Beauty; and among Mortals,
Virtue's choicest Sample^, which She makes a Pattern for Her Fairest Draughts:
One, whom Nature had taught with best grace to adorn Majesty; and with the
Luster of Her least rays, to dazzle Glory Her self, who now stood at distance
Blushing, yet ambitious to attend this GREAT QUEEN, Blessing the State^

On either hand, stood a ROYAL PRINCE; Both which, were Darlings to the same
Nature, which at Their Birth, thought it no Solecisme to cloth Maturity with
^oungest years: Both, with a Youthful, yet graceful blush, seemed to Smile,
as seeing themselves laden with Others Hopes, while They stood as Center to all
the Lines of future Felicity: Over One of them, hovered a Crown, with this
Motto, DON DES CIEUX A Gift from Heaven.
.

Near These, were placed Two Fairest Young Ladies, in Rich attire, Carnation
guarded with silver deluces; Their Hair, knotted with Stars, and powdered
with Golden Attoms, raised up with a Dazzling Ray, darted out from that Sphere
of Brightness, fixed under the Royal State.

At whose beck, a Cloud^ in an instant Rising, discovered THE FIRST SCENE.

A SCENE of DARKNESS; an Impresse of Horror: a Chaos f^lt, though not See^e.
NIGHT, not content with her wonted Sables, affects now a more dismal hue;
Enters, presenting Terror in a Lantskip, shadowed with blackest colors; The
Inscription in a strange Dialect (speaking more admiration,) SKOTOS A Greek
wo^d, sig^ify^ng DARKNESS.
.

NIGHT-WORK: b^ing also a desc^^ption of THVLE.

In this Antim^^^^^ inscribe^ SKOTOS, is preshadowed the whole P^ot o^ the
Masque ( more particul^rly personated afterward in several Entries) First,
Saturn and Mercuries Quarrel, about the Northern THVLE; and th^n the
Pacification, interrupted awhile by MARS: but at length happily perfected by
the Goodness of PHE^VS and his Royal PHEBE.


Steep rising Hills, far off, (mocking night, at noone, with shady tops of
pathlesse groves) fill half the Scene: Leaving for the nighest part a Solitary
Valley, divided with a River; whose purling Streams (murmuring through broken
rocks) taught the Woods, beyond, to Tremble; Their boughs and leaves being
shadowed on the Water by the glimring MOON: Whose weak Beams (Refracted with
frequent flashes of Lightning, breaking out from blackest Clouds) made up a
Faint Light, much more dismal then Darkness; For 'twas only enough to make
Dark Coufusion seem more Horrid.

These Trembling measures, traced in full time, to the crowing of Cocks (only
ecchoed in saddest reports, from farthest distance) interrupted with harsh
unpleasing kroaking, and hideous Scritchings of Nights Forlorn Creatures; made
up the Music that best accords with Nights Discord.

This Scene presents the Antimasques, acted by Drowsy MORPHEUS, Pale PASSION,
and Trembling FANCY.

At length (lest Horror yet should seem imperfect;) Nights wonted silence, was
forced to degenerate into a Whispering murmur; Which quickly grew up into a
most violent and confused Tumult: which being re-echoed by many Counter-bounds,
midst hollow rocks, brake out at once, into most terrible Claps of Thunder; at
which, Nature her self, seemed to Startle, as amazed at such unexpected
Commotions Saturn and Mercuries QVARREL.
in her Lower Elements.

When This had a while detained the Thoughts, rather then Eyes, of the
Trembling Spectators: The Cloud soaring up too near the Royal State, was
instantly dissolved and dis-appeared; while Brightness again unvayl'd
Herself: at which a New Scene Rose up (while the Former vanished) forcing
Black Night to post away her Chariot, mounted on her own Birds Night-Owles.
.

But These (being dazzled with that sudden unexpected Brightness) mistook
their Way; and in sted of falling, soared upwards wincking (like Seeled
Lanners:) yet not able to mount to the Spears, began to hover a while in the
Air: at which pause, Night seemed offering to speak; had not some present
Deity struck her down; and so prevented, rather then interrupted, Her Dark
intents When these Commotions seemed brought to their end, they here begin
again; and Rose even in their Fall (which is more cl^erly expressed anon, When
MARS disturbs the First Pacification;) ^ut at length all is so well settled,
that by some Divine Power, NIGHTS Da^ke intents, seem Prevented rather then
Interrupted.
.

At Her Descent, Dull OBLIVION and Soft SILENCE, not able to hold pace with
their Flying Mistress, were forced to stay behind Her; and so were still
detained, as Foyles, to Grace the following Scene of Glorious Brightness At
the end of these Commotions, the CAUSES petition PHEBVS for an Act of OBLIVION
page 17.

Even as the Athenians of old, after the Civil war, called the Holy War,
blotted out all, with a Law of Forgeting, entitled AMNHSTIA.

See T^u^^^d. Pa^s^n. Attic. and the S^ on ^ris^^p^. Pl^t. and Pav.


.

THESE ANTIMASQUES being thus past; from a Clear Heaven, opening on either
side, came Two Chariots, curiously touched with Gold, each borne up with a Cloud
of Aurora Color; gently gliding down the Air in equal pace, till near the
State they met: Where, in an instant dis-appearing, They left Two Seeming
Deities, or Second Causes, in form of most Beautiful young Virgins; Richly
clothed in Sky Colors, waved with lightest Azure, hightned with silver;
loosly tuckt about with a Starry Girdle, such as Plebeians call a Zodiac;
Their Arms bare, with bracelets of Pearl; Their Fair Hair Dischevald, mixed
with silver: On their Head, a Coronis of Stars; yet of such different Light,
Color, and Magnitude, that at distance they seemed Roses, sweetly mixed with
Lillies; which jointly refracted their Rays, into a most pure Carnation Iris.

Both These These Ce^estiall H^roi^es, are ASTRONOMIA and ASTROLOGIA. For as a
true Histo^y may ^epresent the Terrestrial, So these Two present the
Celestial Plot of this Masque of Heaven: Being the true place and motions of
the Heavenly Bodies ( shadowed on earth) through 1639, 1640. etc.
addressing themselves of the GREAT QUEEN under the State, with a blushing
Startle, as amazd at some unexpected Majesty (though they expected much)
humbly presented a Little Scrowle, seeming a petiti^n: yet some thought it the
Plot of the Masque. What ever it was, Her Majesty received it with a gracious
smile, and seemed with much delight to read it; while They Both, were Rapt up
within a glorious Rainebow, mounting up HEAVEN by degrees, while They sung
thus, to the GREAT QUEEN.

Clouded Eyes in darkest Night,
To Thee may glance for Beams of Light:
That Sphere of Brightness in Thine Eye,
Darts Rays enough to make a Sky.
Thy Stock of Beauty has a power
To dawne a Sun, for every hour.
But Pity yet poor Mortals sight:
With Lawn or Cypress Cloud Thy Light;
Lest Thy Beauty, FAIREST QUEEN,
Dazzle all, and be Unseene:
Celestial Hero's Who were now to be Masquers with her Majesty, in this Masque
of Heaven.
Durst not ask
To See Thy Face, but in a Mask.
With Thee yet PHOEBUS Who was already masked within the Spears.
has prevaild
To let Thy Beauty be unvaild:
That in His sted Thy Glorious Ray,
May Condescend to make a Day,
Throughout This Hemisphear; while He
Masked presents a Masque to Thee.
It Is Heaven's Will,
That We unseene,
Should echo still Here They were hid in the Clouds; and a sweet melting
Echo, began in Heaven, and thence being reflected through the whole Scene,
made up the last verse FAIREST QUEEN.
Fairest QUEEN.
Which Echo, was most artificially caught, and continued with most harmonious,
soule-ravishing Music; While the GREAT QUEEN rose up in a Rosie-coloured
Cloud; and was afterward seen, with the Masquers, ( yet Unveyld) Personating
PHEBE: At which the Music sweetly melted, being heard at, distance, as from
within the Spears of Heaven.

Whence soon issued PHOEBUS, PHEBVS.
in his wonted Robes: sitting in his glorious Chariot, almost deceiving the
sharpest eye and disappearing, midst thickest, yet purest Rays; which yet were
all but as dark shadows, foyling that far more curious Draught within; to
whose Natuall Luster, Glory could add no artificial complement: Before Him
the brightest Rays, blushed themselves into Dusky Clouds, as ashamed; though
'twas no shame, to be out shonn by such a Deity.

Near This Sun (and yet not near, for so could none) stood Two CAUSES,
IVPITER and MARS.
but Second only; Acted by the Thought, rather then Beck, of This First Moover,
in This Second HEAVE^^ The Glory of these Two, seemed somewhat above Mortals,
because only below PHOEBUS; Whose broken scattred Rays (above enough to make
Day) being reflected on These Two, were NATURE'S Measures, for the Highest
Beauty, in this Lower WORLD. Their Names were nothing but their Natures, well
contracted into JUPITER and MARS; The one Lightened to the others Thunder, and
held the Bolts the other cast: and yet neither did either; being neither
JUPITER nor MARS (though Both) but PHEBEIDES.

Somewhat Higher, with her VENUS (attended with Corona Borea, Lyra, Coma
Berenices, Cassiopea, Astrea Virgo, PHEBE; VENUS: Corona Bor^a, Lyra, Coma,
etc. attending PHEBE.
with other Celestial Heroins) was a Seeming Deity, that might easily have
seemed NATURE her self (as the Poets describe Her) but that Her Age spoke her
much younger. However, Dame NATURE must now admit her Equal, (and Grammar make
no solecism of Two superlatives;) For sure, no Second Place was capable of This
Primest of Beauties, Blessing This Scene. And yet with a sweet and graceful
blush, She seemed to contract Her Rays; that so Beauty might keep that
distance with Brightness, which PHEBE must with PHOEBUS. For with This
Double-Single Name, Those Two Deities pleased to One themselves: And This was
the only way to limit admiration; For, all curious inquiries were soon
answered thus, THIS is PHOEBUS, and THIS is PHEBE; None asked more; for more
could not be said, more could not be Thought.

Yet, one thing more there was, at which both Art and Nature stood amazed; each
thinking That, the others Skill, Which it self, durst not presume to own.
This was a most Natural Likeness, Propo^tion, Feature; yea, Identity it
self, between This Fair and Glorious PHEBE, now over the State In the bright
Clouds of Heaven.
, and That as Fair, Great and Glorious a QUEEN, seen before under it.

Most of the Spectators, ^ot having eyes to see One Sun (much less Two at
once) thought Both Those, but One; yet with several names in several Places:
So, over the State They called Her PHEBE; but under it, The GREAT QUEEN: as of
old to the Poets, The same Deity was (but in several Places) PHEBE, DIANA, and
PROS^^PINA.

Yet some few, that saw with Thoughts, as well as eyes, Thought the One, only,
Real, The other Representative; as Reflected on some choicest Crystal, fixed
or moved sooner then Thought, yet still after the Motions of the GREAT QUEEN.

But, some Sublimate Rosie-Crucians (that were present with their Spectacles)
not yet content, would needs dive to the Bottom of their Deepest Chrysiple, to
search out This artificial Mystery of Nature. In discussing of which, They
had almost made another Antimasque, or piece of Night-worke, by profound
Mystical Disputations, whether Art or Nature, Sense or Reason, could best
separate, abstract, a^ least prescind, a Sprightly Genius from its Body (which
they called the Carcer Animae; the Night of Light; the Terrean Hecceity of an
Etheriall Quiddity:) so that the same Suppositum might exist in Two distinct
Individuums: For, such they thought, the Existence of these Masquers, both in
Heaven and Earth, at the same instant.

And these subtle Losophers (which was best of all) thought this Tactulum of
theirs, a fine Grace to this Masque of Heaven: Hoping their Bandore, might
happly do as much for the Bass, at the next Confort, as the Gras-hopper once
did for the broken Treble Rhodigin: Var^ Lect^
.

In the mean time, not pauzing for this Harmonicall Discord below, the Music
suddenly brake forth above: most melodiously continued with a sweet, though
saddest Ditty; whose Air, was thought to be the same with That, composed at
the Sad parting, of the Grecian Princes, from their Ladies, toward Troy.

While the Music began to pauze with a most patheticall melting Note; PHOEBUS
Rises, and with a most Emphaticall aspect, parts from His Dearest PHEBE
March 25. 1639. the Sun parted from the Moon (the King of Heaven from His
Q^eene) and went Northward in the Ecli^tick; Being then in ARIES the first of
all the Nort^^rn Signs.

How t^is (a^ a^l the rest) was sha^owed o^ e^^th, a^o^t that t^me, ^^lon^s to
History to ^ecord, as in a true Terrestrial Map, parallel to this Celestial.


; whose Eyes only (and they fainted too) were left able, to breath out a
Sighing Vale.

The occasion of This Saddest Parting, was some Important Business of HEAVEN;
at which PHOEBUS himself pleased to advance Northward, there to make Two
Enemies One Friend: Condescending thus to interpose Himself (though below
Himself) rather then by a Thunderbolt to deal with Both, at greater distance.

THE MATTER WAS THIS:

PHOEBUS, pleasing to bless the Southern World, with his chiefest Res^dence,
Deputed MERCURY to the utmost Northern THULE Of this THVLE; also of Saturn and
Mercuries ^ight to it, and Quarrel for it, are la^ge no^es annexed to the end
of the Masque.
. But MERCURY is shrewdly there Opposed by SATURN; upon an old Grudge,
ere-since MERCURY so sorely foiled CUPID, SATURNS grandchild -- Manet alta
mente repostum.

Yet at p^esent, SATURN pretends another quarrel; pleading, Those cold North
Climats, subject unto Him, in PHOEBUS absence: and, to assert his cause, besides
present Possession (almost the best Point in Law) He produces an Old Charter,
Patent under PHOEBUS Broad Seal, on which Nature had stamped the Arms The Sign
of the Lion (in Heaven) ^s by all Astrologers made the proper Palace of the
S^n, and so the Device of PHEBVS.
of HEAVEN.

MERCURY offers Dispute; and doubts not to make his Cause good by force of
Argument. But Saturn could handle his Sith, much better then a Syllogism; yet,
had Logic enough to hold His own Conclusion, and deny MERCURIES Assumption of
ought belonging to Him; yea, confessing He could not Dispute, He thought best
to Moderate; and Himself will Determine MERCURIES Thesi^. And in Conclusion,
Be it Right or Wrong, He Forces MERCURY to go back as he came; and, which
was more, wilily directs That Back-motion into a FALL Diverse times since 1637
was M^rcury the Planet driven out of AQVARIVS, SATVRNS house (shado^ed here
under the n^me of THVLE) and Forced into PISCES: which S^gne all Astrologers
call Mercuries Fall.
.

MERCURY Falling, Protests against SATURNS Injurious Act; and to Right
Himself, Appeals to PHOEBUS MERCVRY Fa^ling into PISCES in March 1639, seems
to appeal to the Su^; who, was then in PISCES a So^t^ern Sign.
: while SATURN Reprotests and Antiprotests; Trusting to the Goodness of his
Cause; not knowing that a New Patent might suspend an Old Charter, that was
never made, or meant, to be Eternal.

To Compose this quarrel, PHOEBUS Himself condescended to take a North
progress toward THULE As soon as MERCVRY had thus f^llen and appea^ed, the
Sun presently left the Sout^e^n Signs, and advanced Nor^^wa^d in the
Ecliptic: yet in ^arrelike manne^, for ARIES the first of the North^rn signs
(into which the Sun then entered) is by all Astrologers called the House of
MARS, and so of War.
; and, left SATURN should prove contumacious (which some feared) He advances
in Warlike manner; Sending also MARS before Him, to attend MERCURY; who,
without PHEBU'S special Favor, was like to prove by much too weak for SATURN.

MARS goes before, toward MERCURY; Yet by the Way lingreth a while in VENUS
House, on old acquaintance; But to his Great loss and detriment, for PHOEBUS
will anon revenge it MARS then also became Northern (both in Latitude and
Longitude) and went before the Sun toward GEMINI, MERCVRIES House.

Yet by the way, lingered awhile in TAVRVS, VENUS House: but to his hurt; for,
TAVRVS is also called MARS Detriment.

This is also Poetical, alluding to the old Fab^e of MARS with VENUS taken ^y
the Sun.


.

JUPITER follows PHOEBUS, with His Thunderbolts, but at distance; and not
without some seeming great Reluctance, going Backward often, as he seemed to step
forward: For loath he was, to hurt his Old Father, yet much more loath, to be
disloyal to his Sovereign PHOEBUS IVPITER (with the Poets SATVRNS son) the^
followed the Sun in SAGITARIVS (so at distance) but with seeming Reluctance,
being Retrog^ade.
.

Both at length, are well prevented by PHEBE'S Wisdom: Whose Royal Goodness
vouchsafes to mediate PEACE: which PHOEBUS Grants to His Dearest PHEBE. And
so, being Reconciled, casts His wonted Gracious Aspect upon SATURN: Who was
thus again settled by PHOEBUS in His proper Place, to the Great content and Joy
of all May 30^ 1639. the Moon seemed to mediate a Peace between the SUN, SATVRN
and MERCVRY: for, she aspected them all, on the same Day, in friendly Trine:
and the Sun presently (as reconciled) smiled on SATVRN in the like Trine. At
which SATVRNE was setl^d in his House and Joy AQVARIVS: but MERCVRY in GEMINI;
under which, Astrol^gers pl^ce LONDON and great part of England.
.

At this, began an Applause through the whole Scene, while the Music suddenly
brake forth again, melodiously continued by all the Spears.

But, while This was blessing the Scene above; there happened an unexpected
Accident below, which in a Plebeian Comedy, might well have made an Interlude,
and have spared Music between the Acts: But Here 'twas much below the Genius
of a Royal Masque. However, it caused some smiles, though only among the crowd
of Lowest Spectators.

Thus it was. A Sp^^ist Prognostique that never durst Think of seeing Heavens
Face (but in a Pond, or through a Piece of Cypress) Hearing perchance that
Heaven would now be Masked, The rest is a Mask, but This a Veyle; covering
Ianus' head with two Faces: of which, one seems to smile ( Et quis ^uit
alt^r?) as if its eye glaunc'd at an old ^nglish C^medy, en^itl^d, WHEN YOU SE
ME, YOU KNOW ME, etc.
before the QUEEN: Thought this an Excellent opportunity to be a Star-gazer,
and yet not hurt his neyes. He vows therefore to make one in the crowd (at
this Masque) though it cost him the Swooning of his last and best Almanac:
which he now regards the less; because he presumes, at this Celestial Vision,
to get, at least, a New Edition of his Old Ephe^^rides, now almost at last gasp.

Having crowded at length (with much ado) within ken of the Scene: The First
thing He heard, was a mutter (among some next him) of SATURN and MERCURIES late
Great Variance. At first sound of SATURN and MERCURY, He thought This might
prove a most incomparable good Notion for his next Calender, were it so
Translated, that profane Vulgars also might understand This Sublime Dialect of
Heaven; which He durst think no less then Hebrew, (what ever more) for This,
He had heard, was Heavens Language.

Well, this Tranflation shall be his own work; who yet remembered some had
told him, His First Minority had Surfeted by eating a Construing Book; which
made his queasie Stomach, ever since, to nauseate Minced meat; specially
Tongues, which (with Hartichocks of the Jewish mould) he had heard the Learned
Doctors most forbid, as the hardest to digest: Yet, he resolves to take
Heart-a-grace, for once, and so will venture another Surfeit.

The first Course was soon concocted; For, SATURN and MERCURY coming aboard,
he knew them at first sight, to be pieces of his own Element; and so might
easily come to signify any thing in Heaven or Earth. But as for Variance, This
he only knew in Practice, and not a word of its Theory; Therefore durst not
venture to translate it ex-tempore; but thinks best to Empannell a Jury of his
best Thoughts, to depose Their verdict for its cognizance. And while They step
aside into a By-roome, He was content to leave thinking awhile; and pleased in
much courtesy to condescend so low, as (all the Interim) to Grace the Masque
with the Tips of his ears. Yet, hearing nothing Here, but Dumb Shows (which
he understood no more then Variance:) His Teeth open by instinct, and he
thinks good (being moved) to inure his Docuity, by instructing some next him;
stiching up many reasons, why HEAVEN would come abroad mewd up in a Mask,
since French Hoods went out of fashion.

But here by chance, Over-hearing His Jury wrangle about their Verdict for
Variance: He resolves to make a New Foreman of the next Gown he saw. But, This
Gown happening to be lined with Furr, he durst not a great while crowd near it,
lest perchance some Mace should hang loose in its pocket, which slipping out,
might raze his Memory with old Obligations. Yet, at length, bethinking
himself, that, of all Vices, Modesty had long been most Odious; he ventures
to accost the Furr Gown: and with a Congruous congie, confessing himself
ingramm in all the Oriental Tongues, beseeches his Worship to give him to
understand, what Variance might mean at Court of Heaven.

Mr. Alderman (for so the other called him) either out of depth of Science; or
else willing to horse the Ass, at least to muzzell him, (Himself being intent
on the Masque) cried Peace, Peace; at which the other quickly conjured his lips
into a Gramarcy of your Honor.

Thus having gotten the theory as well as practice of Variance; and presuming
on SATURN and MERCURY'S courtesy; he scorns to spell any longer, but with
most learned confidence, puts all together in one breath; Thus: Saturn and
Mercury, or Heaven and Earth, are at Peace, or Variance.

But, in the next Breath, bethinking himself he could not prove his words, if
any should chance to question him: He resolves to sleep whole, b^ Unsaying all
again; yet, with a gentle qualilification for his credits sake: and so starts
up in a pythick rapture, and swears by the Genius of all the Good Stars in
his Horoscope, that what ere he thought, yet he meant, Saturn and Mercury would
not, long, be at Variance in Arabic, or Peace in English. Which, he spoke the
rather, that so he might intimate a most contagious Disease, he lately had,
which the Doctors call the Prophetic Tympany: the least Sent of which, he
hoped, might easily give him more room and ease in the Crowd.

Here his memory chancing to stumble on some Heroical Verses, made for his
next Kalend^r; he pleases in much courtesy to perfume Them next him, with a
spice of his Pottery: and so by learned expiration breathes out these
Rythmicall Proses, ushred in, by two or three Antic faces, bare-head.

Now June 1639.
Rests in His Aquary Qui non odit, amet tua Carmina (...): Mart. Epigram.

Lord Saturn, smiling on Mercury,
In Trine: it is well I wot; but Stay,
Till Sirius shall cast his Ray July August, etc.
,
And Leo frown: Titan and Mercury,
With Saturn Then shall be at Emnity Ridentem dic^re verum, Quid v^tat? (...).

'^is true, that after a f^w Smiles in June 1639, those Planets continue
^rowning on SATVRN all the rest of that year, and most of the next, viz. 1640.
But what the Issue will be, appears anon, by the Entri^s follow^ng the
Arraignment of MARS for disturbing the Fi^^t Pacification.

But, how these mot^on^ of He^ven, were ^^adowed upon ^^rth all that time,
b^longs to the Terr^striall (or Historical) Map, to represen^.


.
Enough, no more, yet do not Wonder,
If after Lightning, it do Thunder.
Enough, too much: for speak I dare not now;
But yet I Will Think, and care not How.
All which, and a great deal More, was but a piece of a non-Licet-Booke,
called an All-men-ake: a piece of Felony (what ever more) for 'twas Stolen out
of an old Ephemerides, calculated for another Climat, and not for the Scene of
This Royal Masque of Heaven: Whose Heroic Genius disdaines such spurious
Comitragick Interludes: and yet This Pedantick 'Strologer, would feign have
Canted out his old Prosodia with new Accents, and acuter Tones; which might
perhaps have at length been overheard by some of the Masq^ers above; had not
some near him (wiser then Himself) quickly hushed him, and sent him packing,
to learn New Calculations in the Old Counter-house.

However, This Discord below, with sweet Cadence, brought in, the Concord
above, with the finer grace; at least to the Lower Specta^tors; For the Other
needed no artificial Foyles to Grace their most Natural Harmony, made by
Heaven it self, with all its Spears.

And while this Music melted away by degrees, at the North Horizon PHOEBUS Rose
in great Glory; advancing Southward again with his wonted Attendance, sutabl^
to His Majesty: His Triumphant Chariot was drawn by Sparkling Steeds, Four
in Front, as the old Romans were wont to Triumph In June. 163^. the Sun came to
CANCE^ (called the Tropic, because he there begins to turn southward again in
the Ecl^ptick) but came not in^o LEO his wonted P^lace ^ill Iu^y: CANCER being
his Hig^est Aux or A^oge^m, s^ems a Triumphant Chariot.
.

Now JUPITER also comes back again with his Satellites, waiting on the
Return of His Sovereign PHOEBUS; who, in his Return, exalts JUPITER IVPITER
followed him (being Relr g^ade) and was (...) a gracious (...) Sun b^^ng i^
CANCER which all Astr^^oge^s ^a^l IVPITERS EXALTATION.
, His Loyal and most Humble Servant: who, like a Noble Subject, Thought one
Gracious smile, one Glaunce, from his Prince; more then enough to reward the
most faithful and Loyal Service (possible) to His Royal Sovereign.

MERCURY also, Leaving a while his Northern Station, comes Southward:
Following PHOEBUS, till He came to the Royal Palace, and there Rested,
Dismis^ing MERCURY with a gracious smile MERCVRY was Nort^ern, A^rill and May,
but in I^ne be^ame Sout^ern, followi^g the Sun ^^ll he rest in LEO, where he
was graciously aspected both by Sun and Mo^n, and then became Northe^n a^aine.
.

Only MARS is Enemy to This Pacification: whether out of Natural Antipathy to
SATURN (ever since He mocked him for Dalliance with VENUS) or else in Sympathy
to MERCURY (in whose House He had been Billeted most of This Time:) what ere
the matter was, He seemed much enraged, that He must, either return and strike
never a blow; or else, stay Freezing in the cold Cronian Ocean, as a lump of
raw metal, glu'd to the North Pole, by its magneticall virtue Here (as in the
^ormer Interlude) are ^hadowd some unexpected Commotions strangely disturbing
the First Pacification: These are raised by MARS the Poe^icall God of war,
Enemy to all peace; and in Heaven the most fiery Planet.
.

While He lingreth in MERCURIES House; SATUR^, Threatens him: who quite benumd,
and Frozen into a Dastardly Apoplexy (by the Northern sent of Cold THULE) is
forced to cry mercy: and not able to resist such strong Syllogisms made in
Ferio, he Flies thence; and Flutters Southward again with all his Ice-ickles.
But Coming at length into Southern Heat, He is thawd again into His wonted
Rage (which was Frozen about THULE:) and Raging, Enters PHEBE'S Palace; Hoping
by some means to divert Her mediation, and so disturb the Pacification MARS
being in GE^MINI, MERCVRE'S H^use, APRIL and MAY, 1639, (...) here aspected by
SATVRN; and toward the beginning of JUNE, He is driven thence: and seem^ng
enraged, Enter^ CANCER the MOONS House: Put in CANCER the MOON opposed Him^ as
a^peares by the n^xt Entry (in This Mas^^e) which is to ^e ref^rd to the
Motions of the ^eave^l^ Bodies, through JUNE, IVLY, and the rest of 16^9.
.

But for all his Spurrs, His Rage is Bootlesse: for, PHEBE soon Opposes Him
in greatest displeasure This Op^^sition of ^ARS was but two or three days
after the MOON had mediated Peace between the SUN, SATVRN and M^^CVRY, about
the beg^^ning of JUNE 1639.
, being That firebrand that first kindled debate between SATURN and MERCURY;
and now dur^t smoke also, at That Peace, which Her own Goodness had
vouchsafed to mediate with such happy success.

While He yet Raged, PHEBE so prevailed that with a Ray darted out, MARS was
dazzled; and suddenly fell dow^ as Thunderstruck, yielding himself Prisoner to
PHOEBUS: And so, being drawn Captive like after the Triumphant Chariot, for
shame and grief, He hides himself under it Presently after T^is ^^^^osition
MARS Fe^l Com^^st (and so was Hid by the Sunbeams) in CANCER; Which Sign is
with all Astrologers, called MARS FALL.
.

VENUS, at first, was affrighted at This unexspected Fall of MARS, and Fled
Thence; yet seemed Ambitious to attend PHOEBUS Triumph; and so hastes into His
Royal Palace; there to prepare for His Glorious Return When MARS thus Fell in
CANCER, VENUS was there: but as affrighted, Fled thence into LEO the SVNS
Pala^e, seeming to prepa^e for His Return, which was in IVLY 1639.
. At which, She petitioneth for her old Friend MARS, and beggeth his Liberty:
which PHOEBUS, at length, Grants in much Mercy In SEPTEMBER MARS was set free
from the Sunn's ^eames, in LIBRA; which is the House of VENUS, MARS Constant
^riend, with all ^he Poets.
; Well, knowing that Royal Goodness, to all Ingenuous No^le Spirits, is a
stronger Bond then any Chain, then any Fetter.

MARS, released by PHOEBUS, at VENUS' Petition; was now no Prisoner, yet MARS
still; and still mindful of Former Chains (such is His Temper still!) soon
hastes into VENUS' House, There to renew Former acqaintance. Thence he
plotteth to incense SATURN and MERCURY again: and after diverse assays, at
length prevails so far, that SATURN begins again to frown on MERCURY: which
Frowning Disgust, MARS so resents and soments; that ere long, MERCURY is again
Driven out of THULE, and again by SATURN forced to Fall MARS thus Free from
Combustion, etc. Enters LIBRA, VENV'S House: and thence aspecteth SATVRN and
MERCVRY, OCTOBER. 1639. Which seems to inrage them; for soon afte^, They Frown in
a bitter Quartile: which Frown MARS so Foments by diverse Aspects, that ME^CVRY
being met by SATVRN, FEB. 1640. is Driven again out of AQVARIVS (SATVRN'S
House, sha^owed he^e by THVLE) into PISCES, which sign is wi^h ^ll Astrolog^rs
MERCVRIE^S FALL.
.

MERCURY Falling, re-imploreth PHOEBUS help (His best refuge:) after which,
PHOEBUS condescendeth to make a Second Progress to^ards THULE: Yet resolves by
Gentle Rays of Royal Goodness, much rather then by Thunderbolts, to prevail
both with SATURN and MARS, who now jointly opposed MERCURY. M^^cury mee^s the
Sun in Pis^^s and so seems to beg his help: Who (ere long) advances ^ort^^a^d^
^gain; and in his way, is opposed by Sat^rn and Mars; Who Both also oppose
Mercury. Aug. and Sept. 1640.
.

But PHEBE But in Sept. the Moon seems again to med a^ Peace smi^ing on ^he
Sun, Venus, Satu^n and Mars, (in a Trine) all in (...).
again vouchsafes to interpose Her self; whose own Goodness moves Her again
to mediate Peace (such still are the Thoughts, breathings, and Motions, of True
Royal Goodness) for e^fecting of which, She prevails with PHOEBUS to Sum^on
His Grand Council of all the Seeming Deities.

Who, meeting (according to PHEBUS' Summons) in AREOPAGUS Toward the end of
Sept. 1640. Most of the great^r He^venly Bodies a tend the SUN, in the la^ter
^egrees of LIBRA, The Zod^aks North Limit (that old Hier^gyphick of Justice and
Iudg^ment) Which with all Astrologers are called Termini Martis, and so here,
MARS Hill, or A^eopagus, (The great Iudg^ment Seat in Athens) so called,
because MARS was there Tried by his 12 Peers: of which, Pausanias in his
Atticks.
; think best to begin at the Root of Trouble, the Author of the late Commotions
in the Little World: and so, with general consent, agree to Arraigne MARS, of
Rebellion against PHOEBUS; Disturbing the Peace mediated by PHEBE'S Goodness;
Incensing SATURN, and with Him jointly opposing MERCURY. His Indictment being
Heard; after all Pleas, They all conclude Him One General CAUSE of most of the
Late Commoti^ns: and jointly Censure him, to be most justly excluded from the
Number of Gods: and deprive him of all Privileges, Honors, Dignities etc.
Which are all rendered back again into PHOEBUS Hands, from whose Royal Favor,
they first came In October. and Novem^. The SUN takes possession of SCORPIO, the
H^use and Joy of MARS, who is t^us di^poyled^ and forfeits all to PHEBVS.
.

PHEBE still continues to mediate a Full Pacification, between SATURN and
MERCURY Diverse Ti^es thr^ugh Sept. October. and November. 1640. The MOON mediates
b^twe^n the SUN, SATVRN and MERCVRY, seeming e^rn^stly to desire Peace.
: to which end, Her Royal Goodness prevails with PHOEBUS to continue His
Great Council; and summon all the CAUSES at once; to conclude and attest a
complete, perfect, and Eternal Peace, through the whole Little World.

This being Concluded on, PHOEBUS Finisheth His North Progress, and begins, the
Second Time, to Return Southward again, in Great Glory In Octo^. 1640. The
SUN l^^ves LIBRA (which is the Bound, or Limit to the Northe^n Signs) and
comes more and more Southward in in the Ecliptic.
.

Here a Bright Glorious Cloud Disappearing, The GREAT QUEEN, was again seen
Seated in Royal Majesty, under the State (as at First.) At which appeared a
Celestial Chorus, (Forerunners to PHOEBUS Glorious Return) Rising up at the
North Horizon, like Orient Rays, Sparkling about Phosporus, till Aurora give
place to Phebus' Rising. These mounting Heaven by Degrees, Sing thus to the
GREAT QUEEN: Fair PHEBE, Thou alone have Eyes,
To see Thy Glorious PHEBVS Rise:
If Rise He can, Who is at Hight
Of Beauty, Glory, and Delight:
He cannot Lose, He cannot Get,
He cannot Rise, He cannot Set.
Or if He Set, it is still'ith West,
And still His Rising makes East:
But if in South He Day do make,
Or to the North a Progress Take;
Speak Fairest PHEBE, can we call,
This PHEBVS Setting or His Fall.
When First He pleased to change His Place,
It Is True, a while He veyld His Face This alludes to the Sun's Eclipse May 22.
1639.
,
Contracting in, His Southern Rays:
But to the North, He Them displayes:
Speak Fairest PHEBE can we call,
This an Eclipse, Setting or Fall?
'Twas Pity kept him veyld a while;
For if He, Pleased, pleased to Smile,
He Pit'ed Them, He smiled on, lest
They should be Dazzled, whom he Blessed:
Or if he Frownd, 'twas Pity still,
That veyld his Frowns, that else would kill.
Like Lightning or like Thunderclaps,
Them whom He Frownd on: Or perhaps
He pit'ed Thee, Himself in Thee;
Lest Thy eye, His Frowns, should see,
And seeing Greive Thy Tender Heart:
And so Himself in Thee should smart.
Yet lest the Southern World should miss,
His wonted Rays, Their wonted Bliss;
He left Thy Beauty in His Place,
While Going North He veyld His Face.
That Veyle was but a Mask, for See
How in a Masque He comes to Thee At these words, began PHEBVS to appear at
the North Horizon, mounting up with Orient Rays, like the Rising Sun.
.


Here They entered a Clear Heaven (Full of Twinkling Stars like a Morning
Sky before Sun Rising) singing still; but seeming to speak to some in Heaven.
The Verses not lost by the great distance, were These.

Adieu ye Sparkles, Twinkling in Night;
Who mock us, Counterfeiting Light:
Once called Stars, and Heaven's Eyes;
Now Darkest Atoms of the Skies;
All is so Bright with PHOEBUS Rays:
Though through a Mask He them displayes.
Come See, and Blush, Blushing be gone,
And Going Cry, we are out-shone.
Thus, while the Song and Music most sweetly melted away by degrees; PHOEBUS
leaves the North Horizon In October. 1640. The SUN comes Southward in the
Ecliptic: Having left the Northern Signs at the Autumnall Equinoctial.
, advancing Southward again in Greatest Glory: being adorned with Rays of
wonted Goodness and mercy, darted out in a mild and Gracious Aspect; yet
sparkling with Royal Majesty; which seemed as the choysest Diamond, enshrining
it self midst purest metal; or as a Fragrant Rose, longing to Carnation it
self, with the Fair Idea of the whitest Deluce.

Soon after His Return, All the CAUSES (summoned before) attend him in JUPITERS
About the beginni^g of N^vember 1640, The SUN in Heaven, comes (attended with
most of the greater Heavenly Bodies) into SAGITTARIVS, which is with all
Astrolog^rs, IVPITERS House or Ha^l; which with Poets was the Great
Councell-House for al^ the Gods.
Hall (which was first made for the Great Conncell-House for all the Gods,)
where they consult with one consent, for settling a Perpetual and Inviolable
Peace through all the Little World.

For this end, at length SATURN and MERCURY jointly resign up all Their
Privileges, Honors, Dignities, Possessions, Claims, etc. into PHOEBUS Hands.
Acknowledging Their Dependence on His Royal Goodness: professing They had
rather be devoyd of all that might speak them Happy: yea rather not to Be, than
be Clowded from His benign Rays, and quickening Influence: or conti^ue
conscious of promeriting His least Frown; whose wonted Smiles, were more then
Light, more then Life.

PHOEBUS receives them with wonted Goodness: which, of it self, moved Him to
re-invest Them again; not only with former Possessions, but also with great
addition of New Favors. Which to make firm and inviolable, He Seals, by
smiling on Them with most Gracious Aspects; specially on his reconciled Subject
SATURN In D^c^mb. The SUN b^gins to ^mi^e o^ ^ATVRN in a Sectile; which favor
increase^h, ^ore and more, till about the beginning of ^^bruary, SATVRN waits
upon the SUN who smi^'s on him, (as pe^fectly reco^^iled) in a most Gracious
Asp^ct. MERCVRY also is near, but in PISCES, and com^ust.
. Knowing that Royal Goodness, is still wont either to Find, or else Make,
Loyal Subjects; Whose Freest and greatest Liberty, speaks Their Sovereign,
the Compleatest Monarch; Ruling (not only Bodies with Fear, but) Souls with
Love: Which still was, still will be, the Surest and the Straitest Bond, to all
Ingenuous Noble Spirits; to Rule Whom, is Truly to be a King, a Royal Prince.

Thus most Happily was a Complete Peace settled through the whole Little World;
mediated by PHEBE; petitioned also and most cordially desired, with one
consent, by all the CAUSES; Granted, Sealed, and confirmed by the Royal
Goodness of the GREAT KING: Which to maintain and attest, PHOEBUS was
graciously pleased to Decree, and Ordain, Frequent State Meetings, and
Consultations, of All the CAUSES Thus again in F^bruo^y 1642 is a Great Me^ting
of ^ost of the Heavenly Bodies. But in PISCES. In PISCES also is a ^arr gr^ater
Meeting of all the ^la^e^s (but MARS spe^i^lly SATVRN and IVPIT^R, waiting on
SUN and MOON (...). 1643 And if THIS MOST GREAT CONIVNCTION be not Attended
with most notable Events (m^st probably for much good through greatest Part of
Europe: All Mathematici^ns must conf^ss, They yet understand not, the Di^lect
of Heaven.
.

Who, before This First Meeting was disolved (after a most grateful
acknowledgment of the wonted Goodness of PHOEBUS and His Royal PHEBE, in
quietting those Sad Commotions, so much disturbing the Little World) did
jointly agree to petition His Majesty, He would be graciously pleased, that
all Remembrance, of MERCURY', and SATURN'S Quarrel, might be wiped out; not
only from His own Breast, (which His own Goodness, of its self, had already
done) but also from the whole Little World; so that, an Act of This was
preshadowed i^ the Antimasque of Night and Day Da^ing: where, after Night was
cha^ed away, yet SILENCE and OBLIVION, (among Her Attendants) were still
detained as Foyles to grace the following S^ene of Glorious Brigtn^ss^: This
alludes also to the ol^ Athenian AMNHSTIA, o^ which before in the marginall
n^tes, page 4.
OBLIVION might forever, blot out, and quite remove all Stains, and Spots,
that might respectively adhere to any of his Loyal, and Devoted Subjects.

But, for an Eternal remembrance and Detestation of MARS His Treason; in
Rebelling against PHOEBUS; Disturbing the Peace; and Disquieting the whole
Little World; His Majesty was petitioned, the Name of MARS might no longer
endure in the Court of Heaven. Yet, that all His Former Tenures might still
remain; But only as Eternal Memorials of the Goodness of PHOEBUS, and His
Royal PHEBE. So, that Heaven should no longer mention the House of MARS or
MARS Joy: But for all These (in Their Places respective) The GLORY of PHOEBUS
ARIES, MARS House, is by all Astrologers called the SVN'S Glory or Exaltation.
: And that the Place where MARS Fell a Captive to His Majesty, should forever,
be called in Heaven, The TRIUMPH of PHOEBUS and His ROYAL PHEBE CANCER where
MARS Fell Combust, page 13. (and so a Captiv^ to the SUN) i^ the MOONS Horse,
and the SVNS Aux or Triumph.
.

And because in all the late Commotions; It was much suspected, MARS had been
too much Beckt, and abetted, by His old Friend VENUS (who yet, for some Causes,
was not ^ctually excluded from the Seeming Deities) his Majesty was moved, that
the Place where MARS released, had plotted with Venus to incense SATURN; might
no more be called (as it was before) the House of VENUS; But, the Honor of
SATURN LIBRA, VENUS House, (which MARS Entered after His Release, and thenc^
incensed SATVRN, page 13) is by all Astrologers c^ll^d SATVRN'S Exaltation or
Honor: as app^^res by the Scheam a^nexed to the end of the Masque, page 19.
.

The First of these Petitions was soon Granted by PHOEBUS; But the other, not
without earnest solicitation of all the Petitioners: For such is Royal
Goodness, much more prone to Smile then Frown; yet yielding to Both in
fittest seasons: Knowing, there is a Time when Public Good, calling for
Justice, leaves no Rome, or Place for any Mercy, but That only, which some
miss-call Severity.

Here a Transparent Cloud of thin exhalations opened itself, and
disappeared Erit Nubecula fors^n, non Nub^s.
. After which PHOEBUS is scene, Resting with His Royal PHEBE, under the State;
to the Greatest content and Joy of All. Witnessed by a General Applause, first
began among the Deities in Heaven, and being thence reflected through the whole
Scene, is again Counter-echoed by all the Spears.

Which, for a while seemed to Stand still This alludes to the Winter Solstice,
in which Heaven se^ms to Stand Still a while, while the days neith^r increase
nor decrease Sensibly: Hence it is called the Solstice, or Sun's Standing Still.
, as Ravished with admiration at so Happy a Peace through the Little world:
Then, as Rap^ out of a Pauze; broke out at once, into most harmonious
soul-ravishing Music; first heard at distance, as began among the Spears,
(melodiously Tuned like choysest Voices, into sweetest Consort in several
Parts) then Waved nearer and nearer, till it was artificially Caught, and
continued by a Celestial Chorus; which Entered the Scene Singing, to
Congratulate PHOEBUS most happy Return, and Rest with His Dearest PHEBE, after
the Peace so well concluded by Their Royal Goodness. The Close of the Song
was This: You Sacred Fires, no less Divine then Bright,
Who Dazzle Heaven When You Rise,
With Luster far more glorious then Its Light,
Which yet does more then Bless our eyes.
Your Beauty's more Divine, your Light more Pure,
Your Virtue's Purer then your Light:
Eternal Luster! This shall Bright endure,
When other Brightness shall be Night.
When all the Spears at once agree,
To make one Tune, One Harmony;
It Is not so Good, It Is not so Sweet,
As Yours, When You in Consort meet.
What was too Harsh, what was too Loud,
To Concord now is sweetly Bowd:
Such is Your Music, Such your Skill,
All Notes are Tuned to Your Will.
While Iarring Tones did grate our Ears;
We feared a Discord; But our Fears
Are Tuned to Joys: On Their Bass Part,
The Mean and Treble were Your Art.
Strike That again: again: That Note is sweet;
A Melting, not a Dying Tone;
Your Sweetness cannot Dye: then Living meet,
Us, in your Sphere, Your Highest Throne.
Nay, now we wrong the World; All Loyal Souls,
Each moment Kneel, and Vow, and Pray,
Your Long abode on Earth: This, This controules
Our wish; and makes Us wish Your Stay.
Be long expected in your Highest Sphere;
And long give Light to Mortal's eyes:
For, All the Beauty which They Worship Here,
Is but refracted fro^m Yours Rays.
And When You Leaving Earth, shall Heaven choose,
Behind You leave Posterity,
Like Flowers to gemm and sprout with Heavenly Dewes,
While You Enjoy Eternity,
Eternity,
Eternity.


Here the Song waved away, Rapt into Loud; yet, most melodious Harmony^ into
which as Melting themselves the Celestial Chorus dis-appeared. Then, as
Animate by some New Genius, began a most Sprightly Dance to the Violins; which
ending in Single Passages, The Ladies Rise to Dance the Revels with the Lords.

NOTES on SATURN, and MERCURIES Quarrel, about THULE: with a Curtain Drawn,
Veyled from the Great Queen.
SATURN and MERCURY, in this Masque of Heaven, are sometime Poetical, sometime
Platonicall, yea Chymicall sometime; but usually Celestial; though shadowed
upon Earth also, I suppose, were the Terrestrial or Historical Map to be seen
abroad. Their Quarrel about THULE occasioned PHE^US' First and Second North
Progress Thitherward.

THULE (with Poets, Vltima Thul^) is a cold North Isle; most probably That, now
called SCHETLAND, which the Inhabitants yet call Thyle^sall, if Peucer deceive
us not. If This be not the True THULE, we yet understand not Ptolomy, Pomponeus
Mela, with diverse other old Geographers. However, Almost a^l Modern Writers
Mer^ator with Hond. Cambdens ^rit. in His North Isles.
now agree, It must be some one or other Isle belonging to the Crown of
SCOTLAND: And some think the old Poets, by their Thule, meant but SCOTLAND (the
Remotest Part of the British Isle) For This, was to Them, as Theseus to
Plutarch, The Utmost Horiz^n in. Their Map of T^rra Cognita.

Their Quarrel about THULE, is First preshadow'd in an Antimasque of
Night-worke, or Scene of Darkness, inscribed in a strange Dialect, SKOTOS: And
no wonder; For, even among the Ancients, SATURN (for the Dusky color of That
Planet) was usually an Hyer^gliphick of Darkness Ficin. Prolog. in Plotin.
Enead. 2. l. 3.
. Yea, some will have SATURN come from the Hebrew and Chaldee word Satar, to
Hide and be Hid as in Darkness: which well agrees with the old Poets Fables of
SATURNS Hiding Himself (when JUPITER pursude Him) in Italy; which was thence,
They say Ovid. Fast. 1. Virg. AEnead 8.
, first called LATIUM, from Lateo, to be Hid.

This QUARREL, sprung Partly from an Old Anthipathy betwe^n Those Two (among
the Poets) eversince MERCURY, (on his Birthday,) before all the Gods, So
sorely Foiled CUPID, Lucian Dialog. Apoll. and Vulcan.
SATURNS Son, or Nephew, as They say: (And Plato's Phedrus is the Best
Paraphrase on This Fable:) Partly also from a New Occasion which did anew
actuate Their Old Antipathy. This New Occasion was MERCURI^S New Patent, or
Deputation unto THULE; where SATURN had Prepossession, and Claims much Right
from an old Charter patent under PHEBUS' Broad Seal^, on which NATURE had
stamped the Arms of Heaven. Of which, see in the ^^squ^, p^g. 8.


SATURNS Possession of THULE is a Noted' Story among the old Poets and
Poetical Writers: Who had a Tradition that SATURN lay asleep in a Golden
Pumice, in the bottom of the North Sea, about THULE: Which Sea is therefore
called, by many Writers, The Chronian Ocean, or Sea of Saturn. Of this
Poetical Tradition Eusebius speaks Eu^eb. Pr^p. lib. 1. ^ap. 17. Plutar^h.
Defect. Oracl. and of the Face in the Moon. Cam^den, Brit. Pompo^, Mel.
, Plutarch also in diverse Places; in one of which He tells us of an Island in
the North Sea, called Saturns Isle; which probably may be this THULE.

His Right to THULE (besides Present Possession) He grounds upon an old
Charter: In which The For as ^^^h, or Considerations moving, seem Such as
These; ( For the Charter is not much seen abroad.)

First, as, in Heaven, The Re^^^est Planet from the SUN; and so fittest Viceroy
in Climats Re^^^est from the Su^s Residence, now (for the most part) Southern.

2do. As Coldest Planet, and so Lord of Cold Regions; specially Those, which
being Northern, are most distant from the Suns Heat, and so most Cold.

3tio. As Lord of Aquarius (by all Astrologers) and by consequence Lord of all
Islands; which the Poets place under Aquarius; specially Cold Islands, and such
are all Northern, in the Suns Absence

4to. As in special, Lord of the North Sea, or Chromian Ocean (as was said
before) and so Lord of all Islands in That Sea; of which THULE must be one.

MERCURIES New Patent, MERCVRIE'S NEW COMMISSION for THVLE.
or Deputation to This THULE (notwithstanding SATURNS Possession and Charter)
seems somewhat abstruce; yet wants not some Fair Considerations moving.

For, of all the Planets, MERCURY has Greatest Latitude from the Ecliptic,
which is the SUNS constant Residence; and so seems a fit Viceroy for those
Climes, which are most Remote and distant from the SUN; and such is THULE.

Also, Astronomers find MERCURY (of all the Planets) oftnest Septentrionall,
or Northern, in one or other of his Orbs: For his Great Latitude gains him one
Proper Orb, unknown to the rest, which They call Eccentrum Eccentri; which
makes Him most Excentricall, and oftest Septentrionall. Which Great
Excentricity and Latitude make such Spirall Labyrinths in all his Motions; That
the Best Astrononomers ( Ticho, Kepler, Longom^nt and Lansbergius) confess,
They can not be well Salved, Till his former Motions be corrected, with New and
more Exact Calculations.

With Astrologers also, Both His Houses have Northern Declination; and Gemini
is as much Northern as any one Part of all the Zodiac: Under Gemini also, Does
Schoner, Pitatus, and others, place the Northern Isles; and by Consequent under
MERCURY, Lord of Geminy by all Astrologers.

But the Greatest Consideration in That New Patent or Deputation of MERCURY,
seems His Great Favor with PHOEBUS; which All have still observed: Hence with
Astronomers, His style is Apollinis Sidus, Solis Cancelarius, etc. Yea They
say, His Longitude now differs from the Suns, But in some few Punctill^'s, for,
he seems to go His Pace, and step His step: insomuch that He is seldom seen
abroad, But Lies Hid under the Suns Rays (which makes him most Looked after,
but Least seen.) And no Planet is more with the Sun, But the Moon; nor is She
more, but of^ner.

Astrologers also find Him the Greatest Courtier in Heaven, Favorite to Both
the King and Queen, (They mean the Sun and Moon) also so V^NUS: from Whose
three Characters mixed together, He gets His with Them The Sun: The Moon:
Venus: M^rcury.
. Hence also They place the Sun, and Moon's Palaces, (Leo and Cancer) in the
Midst between Mercurie's Houses (Gemini and Virgo) on either side of which,
are Venus Houses, Taurus and Libra.

With Chemists, MERCURY is Cold and Moist; and so fittest to reside, in Cold
Moist Islands; Such as THULE. These also perceive his Great Favors with, and
near approach to, the Sun and Moon, King and Queen of Metals, Gold, and
Silver. Hence they say, Silver commes nearest to Gold, in Form and Purity; but
Mercury (Quicksilver This is Mercurius Princi^iatus (as they call it) For
Mer^ur^us Princ^pians is one of t^ose T^ree Active Pri^ci^les in each ^ody;
which are SAL, SVLPHVR, and MERCVRY. SAL whence comes Taste) represents ^arth
in ^he Great Wo^ld. SVLPHVR, Fire, (hence S^ell; and from SAL and SVLPHVR, so
or so mixed, comes such or such a Colo^r. MERCVRY^ like Air and Water (moist
and cold) must st^ll bed^w ^he SAL and SVLPHVR, else they crumble into Atoms:
for, N^turall Heat must have Foment from Radical Moystu^e; to supply which,
some s^eke ^o find an Artificial^ ^alsom^ of Nature.
) in Matter and Gravity: though, of all Metals, He be most Crude and
Indigested.

From this near Approach of Quicksilver to Gold (in Matter and Gravity) Some
Sublimate Rosy-Crucian Alchymists, have made deep Plots with Sulphur, to make
Their Mercury become Sol, of a Subject a King (in Metals) of Quicksilver Gold.
But True Mercu^y cannot harbor Traiterous Inclinations: Hence Their
Sulphurous Devices, vanish like Powder Plots: And by Best Philosophers Sr. Fr.
Bacon, Na^, Hist. Cent, 4. Exp. 327. Fernel. de abdit. Rer^m Ca^sis,
, it is now concluded, that though the True Elixar might or could be found (
G^ber A^^bs: Raymund Lull: etc.
the Art of which, was long among the Arabs, Egyptians also, till Diocletia^
burnt Their books) yet Mercury could never make Good Gold (King of Metals)
because They say Sr. Fr. Bacon, Na^, Hist. Cent, 4. Exp. 327. Fernel. de abdit.
Rer^m Ca^sis,
, He cannot endure the Trial of fire ( Chymicall, sure they mean, and not the
old Saxon Ordeire per fire Ve^steg: Antiquit. Cambd. etc.
, which Tried Good Emma) Because He has still had as much Antypathy to VULCAN,
as Sympathy to VENUS.

But, because This is a Masque of Heaven, and SATURN and MERCURY, Heavenly
Bodies: It will not be amiss to seek out some place in Heaven, that may
parallel THULE upon Earth. And no Place, in all the Zodiac, seems so fit, as
AQUARIUS; a most Cold, Moist Sign; under which, also, the Poets place all Cold
Islands; and Manilius, in special seems to place THULE See Scaliger on Manil.
. Now, as the Poets make SATURNS chief Residence, in the Chroniaen Sea, about
THUL^; so do all Astrologers make it, in AQUARIUS: which is, with them, Saturns
House and Joy. And This AQUARIUS (The Celestial THULE) may well be the
Celestial Scene of SATURN and MERCURIES Quarrel, as THULE was the
Terrestrial. For, of all Places in the Zodiac, AQUARIUS seems most Ominou^ to
M^RCURY; Who can never stay Long there, but is either driven Back (becoming
Retrograde) or else Forced into PISCES; which, with all Astrologers, is called
MERCURIE'S FALL As appears by the Scheam^ of He^ven, annexed to the ^n^ of the
Masque, page 19.
.

Now although This Constant Antipathy, between These Two in Heaven, has still
been observed by all Astrologers, in all Ages; yet, it was never so strong, or
strongly actuate, as through the Stadium of This Masque, viz, from 1637, etc To
that Great Con^u^ct^o^ of SATVRN and IVPITER, ( with the rest of the P^anets,
but MARS) in PISCES ^eb. 1643. of which, before in the Ma^que Unmasked, page 16.
and p 24.
.

THE CAUSES OF WHICH, SEEM THESE.
First, MERCURIES Great Irritation of SATUR^, by his New Patent, or Deputation,
into His THULE, or AQUARIUS. The Date of which New C^^^ission, seems to be
about the end of 1637: for a little before That Time, MERCURY was Meridionall,
and waited on the SUN, with more than usual Favor: and there seemed to
receive a New Commission, to enter SATURN'S THULE, with more than usual
Authority. For, presently on this, He enters AQUARIUS ( Saturns Possession) and
in it, is very Quick and Active ( Videant Astronomi.) But ere long, SATURN,
bestirs himself; and without long dispute (be it Right or Wrong; Drives his
New Guest out, and forces him to Fall into PISCES. And, though MERCURY did often
assay to enter again, yet, SATURN as often Drove him out S^e the place and
motions of these Planets, in January 1638. also January and March, 1639.
: ( There is n^ Disputing with a crooked Sith:) till at length being quite
driven out, and Hopeless, He make his address to the SUN, seeming to implore
His help; at which the SUN left the Southern Signs, and advanced Northward in
the Ecliptic, in Warlick manner; Entering ARIES, the First of Northern Signs,
and House of MARS and so of War, (MARS being the God of War, with all the
Poets.) And Here begins PHEBUS^ First North Progress In March, 1639. see the
Masque page 8, and 9.
; with all the Scenes and Entries following, in This Masque of Heaven. The
Second Cause, may seem, MERCURIE'S most Unfortunat Debility, and Extraordinary
Weakness, in Heaven; by so frequent Retrogradations, Detriments, Peregrinations,
Falls, etc. (never more.) through all This Time; but specially Anni, 1640. and
1641. Which is like to produce Those effects, which (for about These years)
were long since, foretold by the best Astronomers, France ever had See Predict.
Par Iea^ Pe^it, pour l'Annee Mil six cens quarante, and quaran^e and un:
Impri^e a Troyes 1625. and Predictions Admirables de Michel Nostradamus.
Centur. XI. Imp^im^ a Paris, 1605.
. Which is yet more remarkable, and seems more Ominous, in that, there are so
many, and Great Meetings of the Heavenly Bodies (through this Stadium) in
PISCES See Ian. Feb. 1640. 1641. 1642. 1643.


This last, viz. Feb. 1643 is the most notable Conjunction, yet ever was.


, which was still accounted the FALL of MERCURY. A Third Cause, may be, SATURNS
Extraordinary Strength, Vigor, and Activity, which has been in Heaven all
this ^ime. For First, for 30 years last past, SATURN was not so well settled in
his own possession, as he began to be about the end of 1637. For, till that
Time, He came not to his House and Joy AQUARIUS; in which, when he came, he
found MERCURY, Acting his New Commission; and no sooner saw him, but he drives
him out (even the next day) and forces him to Fall into PISCES Let Astronomers
examine the Motions of these two Planets, through December 1637. and Iannuary
1638.
, as was said before.
Again, at his coming Home then, He was in his A^x; being in the Apex or
Apogeum of his Epicycle, and very near the Apex of his Eccentrick; Which (as
still has been observed) makes him more Swift in his Motions, and more Active
in all his Actions.

Thirdly, for all this Time, He has been much strengthened by diverse good
Aspects from some of the Chief Heavenly Bodies. For, besides many good Fixed
Stars (both in AQUARIUS; and in Trine or Sextile, to AQUARIUS;) He was well
aspected by JUPITER most of all this time: Which is more Prevalent, because
JUPITER has been much in his own House and Joy SAGITARIUS; which of it self,
also, smiles on AQUARIUS in a friendly Sextile. And all Astrologers say, SATURN
being well aspected by JUPITER (specially from SAGITARIUS) makes great
Counselors. Whence come so many Great events upon JUPITER'S Conjunction with
SATURN. Of which Conjunctions, the greatest and most remarkable, (for Europe)
that yet ever was, will be in February 1643, but in PISCES, as was said before.

Again, He has of late, been much, and often, aspected by MARS. in it self no
good aspect, I confess; yet such as (joined with MERCURIE'S Former Irritation)
must needs much inrage SATURN; and so (by a kind of Antiperistasis) must needs
make him much more Vigorous and Active: for Such is Nature still, when provoked
by some Opposite. Hence Astrologers say, MARS with SATURN makes most fierce and
desperate Soldiers.

But, though SATURN has been very well settled in his own AQUARIUS, or THULE;
and there, has been very Strong and Active, ever since the end of 1637: Yet
is his Strength never like to appear more, than in the latter half of 1640,
and great part of 1641. For, besides his Constant good Aspect with JUPITER,
(either in a Sextile; or mutual reception, all that Time) He will also be a
great Significator through all the Summer, and Dominus Autumni (as Astrologers
speak) for 1640. in 1641 also, there is scarce a Quarter, or a New Moon, in
which SATURN is not one great Significator, if not Dominus Ascendentis: Which
makes it very probable, he will be very Active, and Prevalent, for that Time
also.

Apertio Portarum (of which Astrolog^rs speak so much) is a great Crisis of
Heaven, attended with some notable Alterat^ons of Air etc. by some great
Aspect b^twee^e Planets of Contrary Houses: Chiefly between the Sun, Moon,
and Saturn; whose Houses in Heaven are op^osite to the Sun and Moons.

Such a Great Apersion will be in Feb. 1641. but a Greater in 1643.


Another Argument of This, is the Good Aspects, which SATURN is like to have
(at least for some of That Time) from the SUN and MOON, King and Queen of
Heaven. For, though the SUN be directly Opposite to SATURN (with MARS) in
August 1640; and continues Frowning most of that year; yet, in the beginning
of December, He begins to Smile on him in a gracious Sextile, (while the MOON
also is very near.) And in February 1641, The SUN and SATURN meet, (The MOON
being also in a Trine with SATURN:) which is like to produce some notable Event
(but it is in PISCES) for, such Meetings and Aspects of the SUN and SATURN still
cause Apertiones maximas.

A Third Probability of This, may be the extraordinary great and frequent
Aspects of MARS on SATURN, (never more, than) through that Time. which is more
Prevalent, because MARS is (for the most part) Dominus Anni 1640; Receiving his
Commission from a great Meeting of Heavenly Bodies in SATURN'S Houses, at the
beginning of that year: also, though SATURN be Dominus Autu^ni, yet MARS is
with him in Ascendente. But JUPITER aspecting and tempring MARS, makes him
less Formidable.

Three or Four times in the SUMMER of 1640, MARS being with SATURN, will
jointly oppose the SUN and MERCURY. The last time, is about the Meeting of the
Deities in Areopagus: and this last is like much to hinder the Pacification;
but that MARS is presently dispoyled of all power to hurt, as is said before,
page 14. And though MARS do often Frown on MERCURY, through 1641; yet, being much
in his Detriment and Fall, and Tempered also by JUPITER; All is like to End
well.

But, setting aside This Present Quarrel: Their Constant Antipathy wants
neither Symptoms nor Causes; as many appear in all their Theory. SATURN'S
Motion very Slow, except in his Aux: His Influence very Cold; melancholy also
and phlegmatic (except tempred with JUPITER or MARS;) Being Remotest from this
Earth, and from the SUN (the King of Heaven) and so of a Cold Temper, and Dusky
Leaden Color: Whence not only Chemists, but Astrologers, are even forced to
call him Lord of Lead, and such like Dark, Black, Coaly Substances, dugg out of
the Earth: specially in North Climats.

MERCURIE'S Theory, is (of all the Planets) most abstruce, perplexed and
intricat. Though He be Least in Body (but the Moon) yet not so in Influence:
For, in this, He yelds to none but the SUN and MOON ( King and Queen of
Heaven:) Aspecting These, His Influence is Good to whom Ho^oscopall; For These
He makes Scholars, Ecclesiastical Men; yea often They say, Bishops and Prelats^
Yet His Influence is most inconstant; Whence His Epithets not only with Poets,
but Astrologers, are Ancops, Versatilis, Versipellis, etc. Yea the Chameleon of
Heaven, at which Plotinus could laugh, when most serious Ficin. Prolog. in
Plotin, Enead. 2. lib. 3. cap. 1.
.

Aspecting SATURN He uses to Frown; Being as Swift, Active, and usually Hot,
as SATURN is Slow and Cold. Hence Their Aspects raise Great Storms, Wind,
Thunder, etc Suff^ci^nt instance of this may be the storms etc. like to attend
the Opposition (...) Mercury, by ^atu^n ( (...) Ma^s) about Aug. 16^.
. Great alterations in the Air, in Men's bodies. Yea, in whole States, etc. if
Astrologers deceive us not. For, from his swift motion and sudden mutations in
Site and Place, They use to ascribe to Him, (I know not why) most of the
changes in Wind and Weather; Temper in Man's Body; Policy in each State;
Religion in each Church; etc. but specially if Dominus Anni; as he was of late.

Yet Astrologers (though Picus Pic. Mirand. in Astrol. lib. 17. cap. 5.
laugh them to scorn) make him a Constant Friend to the X^ Religion; which yet
Bacon says Pic. Mirand. in Astrol. lib. 17. cap. 5.
he makes as Abstruce, Perplexed and Intricate, as his Motions are in all his
Epicycles. In this also, he is Contrary to SATURN; who some say Pic. Mirand. in
Astrol. lib. 17. cap. 5.
, uses to Patronize the Jewish Religion; Because, forsooth, their Sabbath was
on His Day (with us now called Saturday, or SATURN'S Day, though some derive it
otherwise Verstegan. A^tiquit.
) which Reason of Bacons is of kin to that of Plutarch Plutarch Symp. l. 4. qu.
5.
, who will needs have The Jews Sabbath a Feast to Bacchus, who was (says he)
surnamed Sabbazios; But I know not where; For Aristophanes Aristoph, Aves.
Tull. 2 d Leg.
will have Sabbazios Banished as a Strange (un-heard-of) God; except he could
find shelter in Athens, no less Superstitious to strange Gods Hence come Those
Altars to Strang^ Gods: of which Paulan, Atticks. Laert. Ep^menid. Philostrat,
Apolon. etc.
, than Courteous to strange Men Xenoph. de Pulit, Athen.
.

SUCH is the Celestial THEORY of SATURN and MERCURY: and such, in part, the
Chymicall: the Po^ticall may be next; and then Platonicall. With Poets (and all
Poetical Writters) Each of these Hero's was (...) (tho one more specially)
which I may translate (though others will not) A Man, A Star, A God: But how,
or why, is worth inquiry.

Whether Multiplicity of Gods, came first from old Phoenicians (as Sanchun,
from him Philo Biblius, and from Both Eusebius Preparat. lib. 1.
) or else from Egypt First, thence to the Phoenicians by Cadmus to Chaldee by
Belus, to Greece by Orpheus, (as Diodorus often affirms. Diodor, lib. 1. cap.
1.2.6. and lib. 5. cap. 1.
) Or first from Chaldeans by Belus, and from him to All other Colonies, (Belus,
and omnes a Belo) as some maintain Sr, W. Ral. Purcha^. Genebrard etc.
(Confounding Gods, Idols, and Images.) I now Dispute not.

THIS the Best of Heathens, Uncompell'd confess Diod. lib. 1. pt. 1. cap. 2.
Plat, Chratyl. Plutarch. Philos. Op^n as among the Jews, Maim^^^d. Mor N^b.
lib. 3. c. 30. and This Rank of Gods the Jews called The Host of Heaven.
; Men, in the World they knew not how, (except like the New Sun-borne Mice on
Nilus Banks Diod. lib. 1. pt. 1. cap. 2. Plat, Chratyl. Plutarch. Philos. Op^n
as among the Jews, Maim^^^d. Mor N^b. lib. 3. c. 30. and This Rank of Gods
the Jews called The Host of Heaven.
,) by Nature soon wanting, and by Instinct as soon seeking some God; out of all
Entities, chose to Deifie the Best to Sense (in sted of Better:) Heaven first,
and Heavenly Bodies: of which to Males, they suited Femals out of Earth (This
Lower World:) coupling Celestials to Terrestrials, to make complete
Generations: the Mother EARTH, and HEAVEN the Father; whose Influence, in sweet
Showers, and Heavenly Dews; They thought the best Gonorrhea Plutarch, as before.
.

Thus, the Starry Heaven (The Highest Sphere, then known,) was but Husband to
this Lowest Earth ( Celi^s to Vesta:) the next Sphere of SATURN, to Rhea (for
so they call the Element of Water From the Greek (...) to Flow.
) JUPITER to JUNO (the Sphere of Air) the SUN was Husband to the MOON, which
they thought but the Best and Highest EARTH, or Earthly World Plutarch, of the
Moons Spots.
.

THESE, were a while so Happy to be Gods alone, (But without Temples, Altars,
Images, til Belus' time Eusebius. prep. lib. 1. cap. 9.
) Yet so, that Wise men were not so Sottish, as to Deifie Dead lumps of Earth,
or Fire, (or any senseless Body, Heaven or Earth affords;) But, They thought,
All these were Animate; at least Actuate by some Living G^nius; Which they
called the Soul, or Intelligence of HEAVEN, SATURN, JUPITER, etc. And to Th^se
was given Deity and Worship; Yet under the Names of the Spheres, Globes,
Elements, and Bodies, Which each Genius was thought either to Inform, as a
Soul, or Assist and Actuate, as a Separate Intelligence The Platonists rather
thought these Genii of the Spheres etc Informing Souls; but the Peripateticks,
and some others, would have them Separate Intelligences.
.

But ^re long, Fond Superstition ( borne long before, but now) Creeping out of
its Cradle, began to View, think Fair, call Good, Admire, Deifie and Worship,
each Mortal, which in Virtue (I mean Vice) has stepped but half a step above,
beyond, the Lowest dregs of Basest Vulgars Belus is thought to be the First of
these Men-Gods; whence the Jews called all such Baalim, from B^lus the first
Baal.
.

This Apotheosis (or Art of Godding Men) grew at length so Rif^, that Embryons
could no sooner Breath (nay, even in their First Grave or Winding sheet of
Womb;) much less be Borne (I mean Buried in this great Tomb, which we call
This World) but they were straight forced to hear (though not to answer) the
Vows and Prayers of some Sottish Priest, ready to proclaim them Gods. Yet, at
first, (while Madness was yet content to be an Infant) Dead Men, were only
made, (as only able) to ^eare that Heavy Name of Deity Yet at death so usual,
that (...) and (...), to Die, and to be consecrate or made a God, are Terms
almost Synonymous in old Greeks: Philo Byb. Diodor. Porphyr^ Lucian, etc.
.

This second rank of Men-Gods was derided by all the world almost; yea by those
that could well digest the Former Natural Gods or Armies of Heaven. Xenophon
de Dictis So ratis: and the Scholiast on Aristop^anes Nubes.
Hence we find, Two Ranks of Gods, in all Heathen Divines; Immortal, Mortal;
so Biblius: Natural, Politic; so Tully: Celestial, Terrestrial; so Diodorus
(in the places praised before:) to which Varro adds a third, Poetical; But
These were but Pictures or Shadows of the former Reals.

When Art had thus learned to Make more Gods then Nature could invent: while
Men, Horses, Dogs Eusebius. Prep. lib. 2. cap. 1.
, did long to Die, and so be Deified: Lest the World should be confounded in
its Vows to Namelesse Gods; (and Distinct Names, would quickly Fail to so
Numberless a Number.) These Second Gods were wisely made to Share in Name
Diodor. lib. 1. cap. 1.2. T^ll. de Not. Deorum etc. Plutarch Defect. Oracl.
, as well as Nature, with the First, which were Natural, Immortal, Celestial
Bodies, as was said before.

Hence start up so many Celii, Saturns, Jupiters, Mercuries, etc. as were
Infamous Famous men in Egypt, Greece, or any Country else. Yet usually with
this Decorum, ( first observed in Heaven;) the First Founder of any Family of
Note, was forced a Namesake upon Celius: The Next Heir on Saturn: the Third,
on Jupiter: and so on, in Order of Heavenly Bodies.

Nay yet more, These Men-Gods were, as the World was taught, at Death
Translated to the Spheres of Those Stars, whose Name they bore, or Nature
most resembled, while here they lived Hence most Emphatically were these Dii
mino^um Gentium called DEASTRI GOD-STARS (men deified into Stars) and hence
perhaps came As^er to be T^rminus minuens, as in Philosophast^r,
Grammaticaster, etc.
: Isis' Epitaph in Diodorus is not the Thousand instance might be given; yet
prove enough. Being Translated to Heaven, They were thought by some to commence
Several Degrees; First Heroes, and then D^mons Plutarch Desect. Oracl.
Plutarch Pl^cit, P^ilos. lib. 8. Hesiod Op. Di. l, 1. verse, 121.
: Though some, more nicely distinguish thus; Demons, were properly Natural
Intelligences, the True Genii of the Spears and Stars, never Tainted with
Fleshy Bodies: But Hero's, were These Artificial Deities, Snatched up to Heaven
out of Dead Bodies And ^or this were they called Dii Animal^s, Manii, etc.
Tull. de ^egib. and Servius in Indice. Turnebus in Adv^^sar. lib. 19. cap. 29.
. And from This doubtless sprang the Fables of so many Metamorphiz'd into
Stars and Heavenly Constellations; which are more, then are leaves in Ovids
Metamorphosis.

Yea, so Deeply Rooted in Earth (though their Tops were in Heaven) were These
Deastri; that when Other better Deities, came to be known in the World; Yet
Superstition could not part with so Fair and Numerous an Offspring: to
detain which, was at length Invented This Plot: that though These might not be
made Termini Cultus: Yet they should still remain as Media: Mediators Plato in
Chrat^l: Apul: de Demon, Socrat. Rossel. in Pimand: lib. 2. com: 9. qu: ^.
Plu^tarch as before.
forsooth, between poor Living Men, and the Great Celestial Gods; that were
too High, and Far from any Familiar converse with Men.

To These DEASTERS were made the First Images, Columns, Temples, and Idol
Altars H^rmes As^lepi^d. Eusebius. Pr^p. ^. 5. cap. 2.8, 9. Herodot: Clio.
: All which were but as Traps to catch and hold some Godded-Soule (for more
familiar converse on Earth) Charmed from Heaven For, Carmina de Caelo possunt
d^duc^re Lunam.
: For The Supreme Celestial Gods, neither could nor would, be so intrapt, as
These good Godded-Soules; that once knew how sweet it was, to play, and roll
themselves in Earthly Bodies; and so were kept in Heaven, Much against their
wills: which in their wonted Liberty, much rather would have chanted to an Organ
here below, then be ravished with the Harmony of all the Spheres above. For
(besides the old Sweet Music they were wont to have on Earth;) They found
Heaven at length so crowded; that (though content to Sweat) yet stay they could
not, unless so contract, that a Milion might stand on the point of a Needle.
Yea, and so, could scarce any place be left in Heaven, for Better (I mean
Worss) Deasters, which in following Ages, came Thither, Hoping to find as much
Ease and Rome in Heaven, as They had found or made in Earth.

One of the First DEASTERS was MERCURY: Not that Late Grecian Boy of yesterday,
But an Old Egyptian as Diodorus; or a Phenician Philistine, or Chananite, as
Sanchun Eusebius. Prep. lib. 1. cap. 10.
, will have him. And if we place him first in Palestina, we doubt not but the
Mediterranean Stream might with ease bring him thence, not only down the Ostia
Nili, and Ostia Tibridis; but also to most places of Europe, specially to
Islands, whose Seas are continued to the Mediterranean.

Many Mercuries we find in old Historians; and what was done by All, the Poets
in a Rapsody, ascribe to One: thereby making him a most prodigious Monster, no
Man; much less a God: yet good enough for a Deaster.

Of Five (or more) Mercuries, The most famous was the Egyptian THEUT or THEOT,
The First Egyptian Month.
(for so they write him;) whence came the Month THOTH; and whence perhaps came
(...), to be the commune Name of God, with Greeks (whose Divinity was first
Egyptian:) though I know both Plutarch and Plato too Plut. Philos. Placit.
Plat. Cratyl.
otherwise derive the Greek (...).

A Great God to all Egyptians, was this THEOT, whom old Greeks call (...) (and
by this Name often named in Eusebius Prep. cap. 10.
:) Taught perhaps by Pythagoras, who (alluding, as it may be, to this Great
Egyptian God) was wont to call God (...): which name of God, Plato could well
Etymologise, when in the Great God he could find nothing but (...), Vnum and
Idem: While in Materials, scarce ought but (...); and in the best Spirituals
else, much (...) and but a little (...). Whence he came to know Parmenides'
meaning (at which he startled so, when young) who was wont to say, One was all,
and all One; meaning there was but One True Entity Plato in his Parmenid^
Timeus: Chratylus, etc.
, ( One, because Infinite;) All else, were but shadows of This One; but in
themselves (...), Not True Beings, as Plato often speaks.

Most think this Egyptian THEUT, or First Mercury, the First Lawgiver Plat.
Minos wi^h Ficin:
. Which may be true if taken cum grano salis; For Tutor he was to Isis, who
first governed by Written Laws, if Diodorus deceive us not. Hence is that in
Her Epitaph, WHAT I BOUND, NONE COULD LOOSE Diod: Sicul: lib. 1.
.

This Mercury (they say) First Founded Schools, Composed an Alphabet, and
taught to speak with Grace, and Accent right; Which Art he prescribed by Rules
of Music; whose several Tones (the Three Best at least Diapason: Diapente:
Epitrite.
.) He found by comparing Summer with Winter in a mean proportion of Spring
Rossell in Pimand.
: Which way I more admire then that of Pythagoras, who found all Musical
Proportions, by weighing the Smiths Hammers, which he heard make sweet consort,
by knapping on the Anvill Ficinus on Timeus.
.

From his teaching to speak well, he was called Hermes; because (...): (which
Etymology Plato Plat: Chratyl:
might learn in every leaf almost of Homer.) Hence in each Sacrifice, were
Tongues sacred to Mercury; While the Praeco cried, Favete linguis Scholiast: in
Aristoph: Plut. and Nub.
: which with them was that (...) of which Plato discourses so Divinely.

Hence was Mercury styled God of Eloquence, and all Learning; Patron of
Scholars, and all Ecclesiastical persons. Yea to make him Eloquence it self,
seemed no Harsh Trope. And because Eloquence can insinuate it self into every
man, and steal his Affections, his Heart, himself: Hence Mercury with all the
Poets has still Heard, Vafer, Versutus, Callidus, Fur, etc. Yea so Notorious a
Thief, that no sooner Borne, but in his Cradle, were found Lucian Dialog:
Apoll: Vulcan.
, Mars Sword, Venus Girdle, Vulcans Tongs, Apollo's Harp, Jupiters Scepter;
Only He spared His Thunderbolts, because so Heavy and Hot, would burn his
fingers, (who ever dreaded Fire, as was said before) and might roar so loud,
that all the Gods might wake, and so descry some of his Knaveries: For all
could not be Seen or Known.

SATURN with Poets, was King of Cre^t; and being ^ranslated into Heaven; There
became One of Their First Deasters. Yet I find a SATURN much Elder, then That
Cretian was, or could be: of whom Sanchu^ at large Eusebius. Prep. lib. 1. cap.
10. speaking ^f Phenicia Theolog.
.

There was of old (says he) in Palestina, One called ELIOWN, Surnamed (...)
Most High: which Phrase may occasion his Reader, to compare this History, with
some of the Jews Records of their Elohim, and his B^rith, whence came Heaven
and Earth, ^srael, etc.
Who, of his Wife Berith, be^^t Heaven and his Sister Earth; These Two begat
SATURN, surnamed Ilus, and Israel; with many mo, when were all called Elohim,
because Companions to SATURN surnamed Ilus. But This SATURN Rebelling against
his Father; was at length so Straightened, that to make his Peace, He was forced
to Sacrifice His own, and Only Son Hence perhaps might come that ^arbarous
Sacrifice, of Sonns to Saturn^ first began by Phenicians, thence con^inued by
Carthaginian Po^^i (Plat. in Mino^, and Eusebius. Prep l 4. c. 16.) In which
Plutar^h c^uld find the etymology of Top^et, while he o^se^ved Hidous
Drummings, made b^ that which the Jews called Toph, used to drown the s^d
yellings of Mo^ochs bloody Sacrifice.
. But after This Sacrifice, being translated into SATURNS' Sphere, He soon
became a God, etc.

Yet, it seems He left his Corpse behind him, here; to be imb^lmed by the
Poets; who, to preserve it incorrupt, corrupt it themselves, by stuffing it
with Bitt'rest Spices For, such would best imbalm: as Aristot. Di^dor. and
^lutarch ^bserve.
. Hence, with Them, He still smells of Rebellion against his own Father, Whom,
he bound; Cruelty against his own Sonns, whom he devoured: Yet, could not
digest; For, chancing at length to swallow a Great stone (in sted of JUPITER)
He began to Vomit, and so was forced to cast up all his eaten sonns again; but
yet much mangled and broaken, for such was the Blessing of His Teeth.

To English This Poetical Fable; All fly to Allegories: Which indeed are a
Panpharma^^n, able to c^re all Diseases; and sure All, if This One, The
Poetical Phrensy. By SATURN, T^lly will understand Time Which Tuly learnt from
Plutarchs Philos. quest. where (...) and (...) are thought n^^re of K^n^.
, Heavens Son, yet measuring (and so limiting or binding) Heaven it self;
Dovouring all his Sonns, being Edax Rerum; yet bringing up all again; for,
Corruption Vnius est Generatio alterius. Astrolegers salve all thus: with them
Saturn is Malign^n^, and binds or hinders H^aven's good influence; killing all
^is Sons, to whom he is Hor^scopa^l: yet he is also boun^ or limited, by
Iu^iter, (the next Planet below ^im) whose good Rays temper Saturn.


But, of all Allegories in This, the Plat^^ick seems most Divine: Their
General Rule, for Poetical Divinity, is This; in Their scholia's on Plato^s
Cr^tu^us. Poetical Names of Station (such as Vesta) denote a Perman^nce of
Essence in the True God (whom to be One, and One only, They all acknowledge,
When they be serious and not minded to laugh, as Plato Himself speaks Plat.
Epist. a^ Dionys.
;) Names of M^tion (as Rea, Fluxus) denote Divine E^^lux ad Extra: Names
Masculine, Gods Power most Active. Feminine, His Fecundity to Others.

CELIUS, SATURN, and JUPITER (the Three First Great Gods, with Poets: the Three
Highest Planets in Heaven) are with Platonists, the Three distinct Hypostases
(or kind of Persons) which they find in All (much more the First of all)
Intelligent Entities. Which Three, They express by the Spears of Being (or
CELIUS;) of Knowledge (or SATURN;) of Activity or JUPITER. These three Spears
we find in our own Souls (as in all Intelligent Beings) and call them (to
speak in Modern language, lest some should Understand me) Essence,
Understanding, and Will.

For, Will With us, is with Them but Activity; the same, in Re, with
Understanding ( as shall appear anon) and Both, the same with Essence in each
Intelligent, much more the First, Entity. For, if there be Any Entity, we must
grant there is some, ( at least One) Simple Entity; else there must be
Infinite Compounds actually co-existing (which the Masters dare not yield.)
That Simple Entity must be Infinite; ( for, all Limitation speaks Composition;
For, let us inq^^re why a Man is not also an abstract Intelligence: yea why not
All Entity? sure ^ither because he cannot, or el^e because he will not: (he
will be a Man, and nothing els^, nothing more.) Both these Reasons imply
Composition in Man: for, if Man's ^ssence, Power, and will, we^e Prorsus Idem^
one of them could not bound or limit the other.
) Therefore but One; and yet This One, must be All Entity (possible;) else not
Infinite. Ergo, the First Entity must have Knowledge and Activity, ( else He
has not All Entity) Yet in It, These Two must be the Same; and Both, the same
with Entity it self; else It is not Simple Entity. But of This perhaps more
anon. I proceed:

CELIUS, Their First Hypostasis, is the Sphere of Being; Essence in all Second
Intelligents; but, in the First, They choose to call it Entity, rather then
Essence, (which, in the Schools, hears Entity limited to such or such, a
Species; but the First Being is Entitas Simplex, without any Restringent
Essence But all Second Beings are said to be compound^d of Es^e (Entity) and
Ess^ntia, which is such or ^uch a Restring^n^, limi^ing to such or ^uch a
Speci^s: only the First, is purely Tra^sc^^de^t.
.) Now, as the Highest Starry Sphere, is but One, and yet All; (a kind of
Infinite) Containing in it All inferior Beings, not only Locally, but
Virtually (if no more;) So, si licet parvis --;for, this Sensible World is but
a Shadow of That Supreme, Intellectual, Infinite) That First Sphere of Being
is One, yet truly All, because Infinite; containing in it self All Entities
(possible) yet as in One Entire Sphere; and hence, say They, the Poets called
it (...), CELIUS, Heaven. Next within This Infinite Sphere, are circled (...),
as Plotinus speaks En^ad, 6. lib. 9. cap. 8.
. Those Second Gods (sure, he means) who with us are Intelligentiae. Next
(says He) is circled (...); consisting o^ Three Lesser Orbs^ (...); of These,
the First and Best is still Concentricall to Celi^^; but Reason and Fancy (the
two lower Orbs) are, too too often Excentricall. This he saw, who yet was but
purblinde, and at best, but in Twilight, or Day-Dawning.

This CELIUS must have in himself all Entity; (else not Infinite) all
perfections; Therefore K^owledge, He must be Intelligent. And Having All within
himself, He cannot but know all. For, I suppose there is nothing required to
perfect Knowledge, but Presentia (s^u una) Objecti, ad Potentiam Scibilem, (for
I now will speak in their Dialect:) and because Beings themselves are not in Us
but by their Species; hence our knowledge is so weak, and Imperfect.

This Knowledge of himself, They call Reflectio in s^ipsum, which is the very
Flower and Top of all Knowledge. CELIUS then Reflecting on Himself, Saw within
Himself, His Own Image; Which Image so Begotten, These call SATURN (and is
usually styled by them (...) Insomuch that a great Platonist ^eading that
Phrase in a Div^ne writer; said, he stole it from his Master Plato: as Euse^ius
reports in hi^ Prep.
,) on whom They say CELIUS is even Stamped, or Graven, as the Seal on the
Signet; and Hence, the Poets said, CELIUS was bound and cut by His Son SATURN.

In This SATURN (or Image of himself;) CELIUS Being Infinite (and so all)
Entity; must (They say) needs See all several Ideahs, or Species, which are
possible in the Sphere of Entity: as Intelligens, Volens, Amans, Videns,
Vivens, and the like; which yet were summd up all into four General Ideahs,
Ens nudum, Vivens, Sentiens, and Intelligens From these four (or else from the
four Metaphy^^call Ideahs, Ens, V^um, V^^um, ^onum) ^ome Platonists think the
First Caus^, in all Languag^s, is sti^ed ^y a ^etragramm (or Name with fou^e
Letters^) of which Fici^us often discourses, ^n Plato's C^ratylus and other
places.
.

SATURN thus with Them is The Sphere of Knowledge, or the Ideall World: in Whom
Ideahs have Their First place; and come thence, First into the SATURN (or
Understanding) of Created Spirits; Then being Stamped on Several Lumps of
Matter (as on Wax) do there beget the Proles of a Form (answer^ng to ^ts Idea
in SATURN, as the Picture on the wax, to its Seal.) This Form was by
Philosophers, well called a Species or (...), for 'twas but a Second Species,
or Ideah, Resulting out of SATURN'S Ideahs, as the Species results from the
Face to the Crystal Glass.

But before These Ideahs (or Sonns of SATURN) came Thus out, on Matter; They
were First (They say) by a Reflex Act of Understanding, as it were swallowed by
SATURN Himself, (who looked on them all, as One entire Ideah in Re, Differing
only Formally in His own Understanding.) Then came out again as divided and
broken Hence the Poets sai^, Saturn first Eat down all His Sons: But cast them
up again, yet much broken and mangled:
; and so were stamped abroad on Matter, and there made, or begat Forms; of
which came This Fabric, which we call The WORLD.

This is the True Platonic Doctrine about Ideahs: which They never dreamt did
Exist by themselves, separate from Matter, (as some fondly or ignorantly
wrangle;) Except only in some Intelligent Spirit, which they called SATURN or
Sphere of Understanding; Divine first; and then Angelical; lastly That of Men
That P^ato hel^ thus, and but thus, of Ideahs; is clear by his own
Parmenides, Phedo, Phedrus and Timeus: also by P^utarchs Philos: Opin: lib. 1.
cap. ^. and cap: 10. who tells us Aristotle denied Plato's Ideahs; because,
denying that the World was created: he kn^w not what Ideahs should or could do
in the Divine Understanding.
For Contarenus (though a Learned man) is much deceived, in saying, Plato's
First Ideall World, was the Angelical Understanding. In His Prima Philosophia.

To the Coming out of These Ideahs from SATURN to Matter, Concur Rhea (Divine
^fflux ad Extra) and JUPITER Hence the Poets say, IVPITER and RHEA, Bound and
cut SATVRN, and fo^ced him to bring up His Dev^ured and mangled Sons.
, Who is Their Third Hypostasis, Activity, or Will; coming from CELIUS (
Entity;) But through SATURN also, who is (...) Understanding. This JUPITER
(Divine Will or Activity) with Them was He that Made the World; by stamping
some of SATURNS Ideahs upon a rude indigested Moles of Matter, (which most of
Them (also) think, He first made out of Nothing.) Hence all the Platonists use
to call This Third Hypostasis, The Spirit or Soul of the World; That Spirit
They mean, That first Made, and now does Actuate and Govern; and (as They too
grossly thought) inform and Animate, This Created World. So that SATURN, with
Them was the Ideall Cause (the Sampler, or Pattern) according to which; But
JUPITER The Immediate Cause By whom, the World was made Thu^ they express^
themselves CELIVS made the Wo^ld. Like SATVRN, But by IVPITER: They mean His
will or Activity wrought acco^ding to the Ideahs Drawn in His Understanding.
. And Thus Phenicians Egyptians, Grecians, Thuscans, (all Nations) were taught
to call JUPITER (the Third Hypostasis, Divine Will or Activity) The Spirit,
that Made the World. So, Speaks Philo, and Porphyry, of the Phenicians, and
Egyptians Eusebius. Preparet.
; so, Diodorus of Egyptians and Grecians Diodor. l. 1. cap. 2.
; and so, of the old Th^scans (taught doubtless by Pythagoras) Sencca; They
call JUPITER (says he) Spiritu^^, Animum Mu^di, Ejusque Opific^m, cui proprie
convenit Nomen Esse Senec. Not. Q^est. and De Benefic.
. Hence came JUPITER to be more Known in the World, and more spoken of, by
Poets, then either CELIUS or SATURN; Both whom yet, They granted before
JUPITER, in Nature and Time.

Thus All Nations confess, the World was Made by JUPITER (the Third Divine
Hypostasis:) and the Platonists say, 'Twas Made by choosing Some (and but Some)
Ideahs out of SATURN; and stamping These upon the Wax of Matter (as Timeus
speaks.) Some Ideahs, and but Some: For, all could not come forth Which the
Poets intimated by saying SATVRNS Sonns came out cut, b^oken, and mangled.
, They being Infinite: which I must confess I understand not. For, how could
there be Infinite Ind^viduums in Each Species, and yet also Infinite Species
(For, of These only are the Divine Ideahs, as all confess;) and yet but One
Infinite? And how Infinite Species, differing by Degrees of Entity, can be
Producible, I yet could never conceive: since the Last Species (if I may conceive
a Last in Infinite) must needs, have in it, Infinite degrees of Entity; and so,
indeed, be Infinite: And how Any Infinite may be, or conceived to be, even in
Mente Divina, possible to b^ produced; I yet see not.

But Whether All SATURN'S Ideahs came abroad; or whether only some came out;
and others not: also whether those that yet have not, may come, or might have
come in infinitum; I dispute not. Only, I see it is a received Opinion among the
Platonists, that JUPITER did some-how limit or bind SATURN, (so also the Poets
speak:) as if Divine Will, by its Decree, did as it were, limit Divine
Understanding, or Omniscience. So that More Ideahs were, and are, Known by
This, as Possible; which yet Decree has limited, and made non Futura.

Hence Omniscience, or Simplex Intelligentia, of all Possibles; is with them
called SATURNS Law. But the Foresight of Those Things, which Decree has
chosen, out of that Infinite Sphere of Possibles, and made Futura; is the Law
of JUPITER Pla^. Min. Go^g. Po^it. with F^c^n.
; Which to be the True Platonic Fate, Seneca persuades me (in the Places
cited before;) though some following Stoics, much abusde Themselves, and all
the world with This; because They understood it not.

Any Mat^riall Thing of This Plato^ick Discourse (or Paraphrase on P^eticall
Divinity) may clearly be Found in Plotinus of the Three Hypostases: in Proclus
on Parmenid, and Timeus^ also His Theologia Platonica. Marsilius Ficin. on
Plato's Crat^l^s, Mines, Gorgias, and Politicus: with Plato's Epis^les.
Mirandula De Ente and Vno. Ficin. De Immortal, Anim. and on Plotinus. Rossell.
on Pymander, etc.

Certainly the Greatest, and the Freest Liberty, may well Consist with the
Greatest, and Straitest Ne^essity: Not Coactive, at least not Violent; but that
Connate, Natural (I had almost said Moral) Necessity, which each Being has,
to Act and Vent it self. Which Necessity has not place only in Inanimats,
(Fire, Water, etc.) which we call Natural Agents; but in All; in Rational I
mean Intelligent,) even Spiritual Entiti^s. Which will more clearly appear,
by Examining, the Difference, Dependence, or other Relation, between the
Platonic Celius, (or Sphere of Being) SATURN, or Knowl^dg^; and JUPITER Their
Sphere of Activity: or, to speak in School Terms, between Intelligent Ess^nce,
Understanding, and Will; for so I doubt not to translate their Jupiter, or
Active Sphere.

For, Will seems nothing but Activity: A Rational Will (may I so speak?) A
Rational Activity. Action is so necessary a Companion to Entity, that all
things seem to have as much Activity, as Entity. Every Being is Active in its
kind; ^^d in Acting seems ambitious to vent and enlarge it self. As the Spring
in a Watch (newly wound up,) cannot but spin it self out, wider and wider,
till it fill its whole Balance: So, every Being has its Balance, its Sphere,
through which Activity (its Spring) must untwist it self, till the Watch be
quite down, or the String snapt asunder.

Now, That Natural Desire of Action, which we find in all, (and call Instinct
in some, but Natural appetite, or Inclination, in Other Beings) in Rationals,
we call a Will: so that, the Phrase of Will is now restrict to Rationals, and
These only, but not the Thing: for, might the Phrase Commence, I durst say,
Every Being (even a Stone) has as much Will, as Entity; as much Desire, I
mean, or Will to Act, and Vent it self.

It would then be well discus'd, How or in What, the Will of Rationals, differs
from the Will of other Beings; Since These also Will as, and as much, as
Rationals; except perchance, Having less Entity, they have also less Will, or
Activity: for, different Degrees of Activity, make me much suspect, There are
also Different Degrees of Entity; even in those Individuums, or Species, which,
the Masters teach us, to be Equal.

Is the Difference then in This? That, Rationals, and these only, have
Knowledge also, to Direct and Suspend their Will, or Activity: which else, of
it self is as Blind as a Stones Will, (or Appetite to move downward) and would
perchance stumble as often on Evil as Good, were it not Directed by some Seeing,
Knowing, Eye: Yea would of it self, I suppose, ever act ad idem, Eodem modo,
ad extremum posse; (even as the Fires Will in Burning) were it not as well
Suspended, as Directed, by some Knowing Principle, or Act. And if so I clearly
see that Rationals are Free; But how their Will, of it self, is Freer then a
Stones Will, Videant alii. Even Those I mean, who make the Will and
Understanding, Two Faculties, Distinct in Re.

If They be so; how the Will can follow the Understandings directing, or
suspending Dictate; and yet be Potentia, and Libera and Caeca, (as the Masters
teach,) I could yet never learn.

Violently Drawn, or Forced, it cannot be; and be it self, Free, at least a
Willing Will. Well then, It must Follow Freely, of it self (I mean) nullo
cogente: and That Either, in a Moral Way; (as the Attentive Auditor to the
persuasive Orator, Rapt with Freest Violence:) or else Natural: either
Instinct (for this is Highest) or some tacit Sympathy, Occult (yet Natural)
appetite; (for, so we use to speak, when we would not understand Our selves.)
Of These, the last leaves the Will, no Freer then the Stone to its Center, the
Iron to the Lodestone; Goodly Liberty! the Middle, not Freer then the silly
Lamb to its Dam: yea, and Instinct too, has no place, but in Sensitives, at
least; (for, who eversaid, a Stone moves by Instinct?) and so much as Sense,
may not he granted to the Will, if it be Potentia prorsus Caeca, as They teach.

Nor can it follow Morally, except it be more then Sensitive; even a Knowing
Faculty: for el^e it cannot apprehend those Moral arguments (by which the
Understauding swayes it;) but would stand Still, as demurely as the Will of a
Stone, when the Orator persuades it to leap up, and become a Star, or Sarr's
Intelligence.

We conclude then, The Will cannot be Compelled or Forced, with a Lucretian
Rape; and be Free at all: Nor be led, or drawn, only by Natural appetite,
Occult Sympathy; and be Freer then a Stone: then a Lamb, a Calf, a Sparrow, if
by bare Instinct: nor by Moral persuasion (which sounds most of a Rational
Agent, or Patient;) but it also must be a Knowing, Understanding Faculty: The
same (I mean) cum Intellectu: Except perchance the Tottering Ship of Man's
Soul, need Two Assisting Understandings, ^o one Mast, (like the Two Di^scuri,
See on Argonaut: Apolo. the Scholiast, that is (...).
) to prevent fear of a Tempestuous Shipwreck; which One of them, (if alone)
might sadly preominace.

Thus, while we must needs have the Will a Blind Faculty; yet Free; and Free in
Following the Understandings Dictates; in Suspension, and Contradictiou of
Acts; and yet a Faculty really Distinct from Understanding; we must provide
room for two Understandings, (two Candles in One Lanthorn;) or else we sweat in
Vain, we tire our selves; And yet (however) in the int^rim, we lose our Will,
(poor Will!) at least our Liberty.

O Divine Liberty! How abstruce is thy Theory; and yet thy Practice much more
Difficult! How Hard it is to Find thee; yet much more Hard, to Keep, Use, and
Enjoy thee!

What shall we say then? is Will, in all Agents, ( Natural Animal,
Rational,) Equal; at least equally Free? for, in each, in all, it is but
Activity; which must needs still be Active, and Vent it self ad summum posse;
even till it fill the whole Area of its Sphere, (or Balance) of Entity. May we
also say, Suspension, (with all Contradiction of Acts, etc.) which seems an
Index of more then common Liberty in Rationals; Comes not from Will (strictly
so taken) Which of it self would still Act ad extremum; as well to This as
That, to Evil as well as Good; But from Knowledge, from Understanding, (I
mean the Whole Soul) which by its light, sees what is Good; what
inconvenient; and so guides, quickens, or suspends its Acts: Where as Fire, and
such like Agents, Act still on, forward, without a stop, without breathing;
because they have not, as Rationals, Oculatas Manus.

For shall we say, Our Soul is, but as, a Seeing Hand, or Doing Eye? or like
Plato's Idea of a Good Prince, Philosophus Regnans, or Rex Philosophans? While
it sees, perceives, (so Philosophus) it is Intellectus; but while it Does, or
Commands, (so Rex,) we call it Will. Its Mediat Acts, are Imperat: Immediate,
We call Elicit^. Not that Understanding and Will, are Two Things really
Distinct; but Both make, Both are, but One Soul, under Two Notions. Thus One
and the same Commander, Sees his Enemy's approach; Desires and Plots their
Overthrow; and Commands a Charge. In the First, he is as Intellectus
Speculativus; in the next Practicus, or perhaps Voluntas Eliciens; in the last,
Imperans: In Both, in all, Vna eademque Anima, Intelligens, Volens, ( id est,
Agens.)

Yet, may the Names of Understanding and Will, be still retained; if, but to
parallel those Two Noble, and truly Vital Acts; which we find in that Terrean
Soul, that lump of living (I had almost said Spiritual) Flesh, which we call
our Heart Our Heart has two Sines, and two chief Ac^s or Mo^ions: at the
Right Sine it sucks from ^h^ Liver pure Blood, and Na^u^al^ S^irits (by its
Diastole.) The Blood and Spi^i^s (so suc^^ in) stay a while in the middle
Val'ee, which ^hey call Sept^^ Cor^is^ there meeting wit^ pure air (sucked in
from the Lungs) are all concocted into Vital Spir^^^; And These are ^ent ou^
(through all the Arterie^) by the Hear^s Systole: whence comes our ^ulse.
. For, me thinks the Understanding may be fitly called, the Soul's Diastole; by
which it sucks in, that pure blood of Truth; which is concocted in Septo Anim^;
till (being made true Vital Spirits, of Moral Goodness,) it be sent out
again, by the Soul's Systole, called Will: whence come all the Motions, or
Pulses, which we find in our Moral Arteries. Yet, Both These Sines, s^all make
up but One Heart, One Soul.

On this Whole, One, Entire Soul; Rays of Light, darted from the First Light,
(yet now so Refracted, that they only make, the Soul's Galaxta, Reason.)
Compose Those Ideahs; Which being drawn a new, by the Pencell of Sense; and
Flowred with Discurse, (whence Truth results sometimes, like Sparks by knocking
Flints;) Make up Those Animae Sidera, which we call Habits; Moral, if of
Doing; Virtues if Well; but if ill, we call them Vices: But Intellectual, and
Speculative, if of bare Knowing; if of Directing (by Knowledge) toward Action,
then we call them Intellectual Practical. Of These last, Prudence directs the
Moral part of Every Act, (in Object, End and Moral Circumstances:) Art the
Natural. For, Both these Parts, have Place in Every Action (that is Rational,
Human^, as we call it, and not only Hominis:) and Both these, are directed by
Practical Habits. Whence Arts ( Gram. Rhet. Logic All ^ur Acts are (...) or
(...). This is ^i^ec^ed by M^c^anick Art^^ That by Li^erall: which are only
Three; M^thematicks being pa^tly Scie^^e^, partly Mechanic Arts.
:) and Ethics (which is Prudentia Doctrin^li^,) proceed by Rules and Pr^cepts
(Directing to speak well or do well) not by Definitions, Divisions, etc. which
belong, to Sciences perse, to Arts, but per accid.

All Practical Habits, are both Docentes and Vtentes; ( Speculative, Docentes
only:) while the Soul Directs by light, it is Habitus Docens; while it Acts,
what is directed, Vtens: which last, if in the Moral part of any Act, seems
to me True Moral Virtue.

In This, in All, SATURN directs JUPITER; Knowledge, Action; Understanding,
Will: or to speak more properly, one and the same Soul, directs its own
Activity (its JUPITER) by its own Knowledge, or Sphere of SATURN.

Our Discourse on SATURN has been slow and tedious: But such is the Motion of
this Planet. This may conclude All. Though SATURN and MERCURY could in re,
never agree in Heaven or Earth; yet, the Platonists found a way to Reconcile
them in Words and Show: For with Them, They Both are (...). But SATURN is
(...), Ratio: MERCURY (...)^ Oration. by which last, They meant much more, then
we by Speech: For, they say, MERCURY to SATURN, is Semen Ideale Plotin. En^^d
