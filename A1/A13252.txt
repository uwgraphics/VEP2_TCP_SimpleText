A BRIEF TREATISE OF TESTAMENTS AND LAST WILLS, Very profitable to be
understood of all the Subjects of this Realm of England, (desirous to know,
Whether, Whereof, and How, they may make their Testaments: and by what means
the same may be effected or hindered,) and no less delightful, as well for the
rarenes of the work, as for the easines of the style, and method:

Compiled of such laws Ecclesiastical and Civil, as be not repugnant to the
laws, customs, or statutes of this Realm, nor derogatorie to the Prerogative
Royal.

In which Treatise also are inserted diverse Statutes of this land, together
with mention of sundry customs, as well General as Particular, not impertinent
thereunto:

Besides diverse Marginall notes, and Quotations not to be neglected, especially
of Iustinianists, or young Students of the Civil Law:

With two Tables, the one Analyticall, describing the general order of the
whole Treatise: The other Alphabeticall, disclosing the particular contents
thereof: That in the beginning; this in the end of the book.

By the Industry of Henry Swinburn, Bachelar of the Civil Law.

LONDON Printed by John Windet. 1590.

TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, JOHN, BY GODS PROVIDENCE Archbishop of
York, Primate of England, and Metropolitan: H. S. wishes true felicity now
and ever.
WHen I had finished this brief Testame^tarie treatise, bethinking with my
self (most reverend Father,) unto whose patronage I might dedicate the same:
In the end I did resolve to make an offer thereof unto your Grace: Being moved
thereunto with the consideration, partly of mine own duty, partly of
your Graces interest. For being a member of your Graces Courts Ecclesiastical,
and having now received sundry good favors at your honors hands: This I
thought might fitly serve for a probable argument of my thankfulness in that
behalf. And on the other side, forasmuch as before all others within this
prouinc^ of York, it apperteineth principally unto your grace, to provide that
testame^ts lavvfully made, be duly executed, being now by Gods merciful
providence Metropolitan and ordinary of that sea, I could not see a more
vvorthie Patron for a testame^tary work. Partly therefore by these former
considerations, but especially I was encouraged thereunto with the
co^templation of those divine graces of piety, learning, zeal, gravity,
bounty, benignity, affability, and al manner not only sufficiency, but
excellency of virtuous gifts, vvherevvith the giver of all goodness has
vvonderfullie enriched your honorable mind. Wherefore as hitherto your
vvisdome has been accustomed to entertain with comfortable countenance, such
as be studious to benefit either the Church, or the common wealth, though
otherwise they be of small reputation: so now (most reverend) I am with
all duty to crave the continuance of the same in mine own behalf, together
with the favorable protection of these my labors, so far as they be
agreeable to truth, right and equity: which thing I do so much the more
humbly desire, by how much I may seem overmuch aduenturous in making choice
of so honorable a patron, for such a trifling treatise. The Lord of might
and mercy multiply his spirit upon your grace, to the advancement of his
own glory, and the good of his Church, with increase of many years in
health and happiness.

Your Graces most ready at commandment, H. Swinburne.

A Table of the first part, wherein is showed what a Testament or last will is:

A Table of the sixth part, viz. of the office of an Executor.
The office of an executor testame^tarie is first to deliberate and resolve,
either to accept or to refuse the executorship.. 1. wherein for his better
instruction, amongst other things ( vt in.. 2. 4) he is to consider the estate

To the Reader.
GReat and wonderful is the number of the manifold writers of the Civil and
Ecclesiastical laws, and so huge is the multitude of their sundry sorts of
books; as lectures, councels, tracts, decisions, questions, disputations,
repetitions, cautels, clausules, common opinions, singulars, contradictions,
concordances, methodes, sums, practickes, tables, repertories, and books of
other kinds (apparent monuments of their endless and invincible labors) that
in my conceit, it is impossible for any one man to read over the hundred part
of their works, though living an hundred years he did intend none other
work. Wherefore by the publishing of this testamentarie treatise, I may be
thought to power water into the Sea, to carry owls to Athens, and to trouble
the reader with a matter altogether needless and superfluous: But yet for all
this, in case this one little book may serve in steed of many great volumes;
then I hope that in the equal judgment of such as be indifferently affected,
the same is rather to be admitted as commodious, then rejected as superfluous.

And now, believe me, (gentle reader) I have desired earnestly and endeavored
carefully (according to the measure of such slender skill as God has vouchsafed
me, and as convenient leisure from other occasions of needful profit and
healthful disport have permitted,) that this one little book which here I do
present unto thy courteous hands, may stand in steed of many bigger books.

The causes wherefore the Author of this book undertook this work.
For whereas by the supreme authority and inviolable power of the high court of
Parliament, holden in the xxv. year Stat. H. 8. an. 25. c. 19.
of the reign of the most renowned King of this land Henry the eight, of
famous and happy memory: It was enacted and established (amongst other
Statutes then made, and since that time revived in the first year of her
Majesty's Stat. Eliz. an. 1. c. 1.
most gracious reign that now is) that such laws ecclesiastical being then
already made, which be not hurtful or prejudicial to the prerogative
royal, nor repugnant to the laws, statutes, and customs of this Realm,
shall still be used and executed as they were before the making of that act,
until such time as they were viewed, searched, or otherwise ordered or
determined by two and thirty persons, or the more part of them, according to
the tenor, form and effect of the said act: Which laws so established,
revived, and confirmed, and not without good cause, and deep consideration (in
diverse statutes, made during the reigns as well of the said most noble king
Henry the eight Stat. H. 8. an. 27. c. 20. and an. 32. c. 7.
, as of the most godly prince Edward the sixth Stat. Ed. 6. an. 2. c. 13.
, are termed or entitled, for the more honorable account thereof, with the
reverend and sacred name of the Kings ecclesiastical laws: Like as in those
countries and Churches of Germany, which have received the Gospel, the Canon
law is admitted and observed so far forth, as it is not repugnant to the
new Testament Schuediwinus Tracte de nuptijs. part. 4. tit. d diuort^^. n. 13
fol. 48.
, and is at this day the Ecclesiastical law of their consistories.

Whereas also the Civil law ever since the Ecclesiastical law was made, had
been deemed and judged for part and parcel of the same Ecclesiastical law,
in cases wherein it does not differ from the same c. 1. de no. op. number. c.
clerici. de iud. extra c. f^^n auditorium. did. 10.. si vero ecclesiasticum.

: For where these two laws be not contrary, the one is suppletorie of the
other, and being mutually incorporated do both make one body Panor. in d. c.

Cap^a. Thesaur. com. op. verb. leges. fol. (mihi) 4^3. n. 23.
, otherwise the Civil law being contradicted by the Ecclesiastical law, ought
to be silent in the Ecclesiastical court d. c. 1. de no. op. nun. gloss. in c.

And forasmuch as these foresaid laws, have not as yet been viewed,
searched, or otherwise ordered or determined by xxxij. persons, or the more
part of them, according to the form and effect of the foresaid act of
Parliament: which thing nevertheless has been (I confess) attempted Vide
licet, per Gualt. Haddon, legum Doctorem consul^^. (and omnium quos vnqua^
tulit Anglia legistaru^ dis^^^simum. lib. de Reformatione legum ecclesiastic.
, yet not so sully effected, but may be and that shortly if God vouchsafe
prosperous success to that notable and profitable work of that grave and
learned man Doctor Percie, now well toward accomplishment.) By occasion of
which defect of the view, examination, order, or determination of the said
two and thirty persons, those Civil and Ecclesiastical laws testamentarie
not repugnant to the laws, statutes and customs of this Realm, are yet (even
as hither to they have been) scattered and dispersed here and there, and
secretly hidden from the subjects of this realm in corners of many books of
strange Countries, and foreign language, entangled also and incombred with
long discourses of far different argument, and no less number of laws
utterly impertinent to the government of this common wealth: so that the
knowledge thereof (...) few in comparison of the rest, whom otherwise I might
happily benefit: Albeit I had once begun, and laid the foundation of the
whole tract, in such terms as I found it delivered by others, preferring
public commodity before particular utility, or mine own commendation (in
case it be less commendable, rather to seek the benefit of the common
wealth, then to hunt after private praise) I did easily alter my former purpose.

That laws transformed from their natural shape, must needs in some sort be
either damnified or disgraced, I do not think to be perpetually true: But if
it be a thing so necessarily incident to all translations, that it cannot be
avoided, it ought therefore to be the rather tolerated.

Suffices it therefore these Latin Iustinianists, that those marginall notes
especially proper to their studies, be left in Latin: The rest, because it
belongs to all, meet it is that it be written in such a language, as may be
understood of all.

regulam cessante causa, etc. limitac. prima.
Thus (courteous reader) I have discoursed unto thee, the end wherefore I
undertook this labor, the cause which moved me so to do, and wherefore I
have published the same in the vulgar tongue. Now it rests that I crave thy
favorable acceptance of my good will, and endeavor, which if thou shall
vouchsafe to bestow, I shall not only think my self sufficiently recompensed
but greatly enriched.

Thine most willingly to his uttermost power, Henry Swinburne.

The principal parts of this Book.
BEing at last resolved (in regard of the benefit of this common wealth) to
set forth this treatise of testaments in our vulgar tongue, I thought it meet
that the method should be suitable to the style: that is to say, plain and
familiar. Whereupon it seemed unto me most convenient, to distribute the whole
treatise into these parts following.

1 In the first part is showed what a testament or last will is: and how many
kinds of testaments there be. 2 In the second part is declared what persons
may make a testament, and who may not. 3 In the third part, what things, and
how much may be disposed by will. 4 In the fourth part, how or in what manner
testaments or last wills are to be made. 5 In the fifth part, what persons may be
appointed Executors, and who be incapable of an executorship or legacy. 6 In
the sixth part, is set down the office of an executor. 7 In the last part is
examined by what means testaments or last wills become void.
THE FIRST PART OF THIS TESTAMENTARIE TREATISE. WHEREIN IS SHOWED WHAT is a
Testament or last Will, and how many kinds of Testaments there be.
The Paragraphes, or Chapters of the first part of this Treatise.
WHether a Testament, and a last will, be both one thing, and of the manifold
signification of this word Testament. 1. The definition of a Testament. 2. An
exposition of the same definition. 3. The definition of a last will. 4. The
definition of a Codicill. 5. The definition of a Legacy. 6. The definition of
a gift in regard, or because of death. 7. The division of Testaments. 8. Of a
solemn Testament. 9. Of an vnsolemne Testament. 10. Of a written Testament.
11. Of a nuncupatiue Testament. 12. Of privileged Testaments. 13. Of a
military Testament. 14. Of the fathers Testament amongst his children. 15. Of
a Testament ad pias causas. 16. Of vnpriuiledged Testaments. 17.
A brief Treatise of Testaments, and last Wills, etc. The first part of this
treatise.
Whether a Testament and last Will be both one thing, and of the manifould
Acceptance of the word Testament.
1 NO use of solemn testaments here in England.

2 A testament and a last will have diverse definitions.

3 Testament, taken generally and specially.

4 The general signification of this word Testament.

5 Testament, taken generally, does not differ from a last will.

6 Last Will, is a general word, comprehending all kinds both of last wills
and Testaments.

7 A Testament, according to the definition thereof, is one kind of last will,
viz. wherein an Executor is named.

. j.
IT may seem, that a testament and a last will be both one thing, and that
there is no difference betwixt the one and the other, at least here in
England; because we have no necessary use Tract. de repub. Ang. lib. 3. cap.

On the contrary, it seems that they are not both one; partly because they
have diverse names, which does import diversity of things; L. si idem C. de
Codicil.
especially because they have different definitio^s: Axiom, that the
definitions being different, the things defined are diverse. Euerar. and Olden.
loco. a definitione.
As for the former reason, it may be thus answered. That albeit our Testaments
be vnsolemne; yet it does not follow that therefore we have no testaments, or
that our testaments are therefore mere last wills. For an vnsolemne testament
is a testament, and that properly or in strict interpretation, as hereafter
shall be confirmed, when we shall speak of vnsolemne testaments. Infrae ead.
part.. x.
And so the conclusion seems rather necessary then probable, that a testament
and a last will are not both one, but different. Notwithstanding, this
conclusion is not simply or perpetually true, for in some respects they are
both one, though in other respects they differ.

Understand therefore, that a testament may Bar. in L j. C. de saer sanc.

It is said to be taken largely or generally, Testamentum) is had in
consideration. Gloss. and DD. in d. j. ff. de Testa.
This word Testamentum, is as much as Testatio mentis, Lib. 2. instit. Tit. de
Testa. ord. in princ.
that is to say, a testifying or witnessing of the mind. So writes the worthy
Emperor Justinian, after Sulpitius, Couar. in Rub. de Test. ord. ex j. par. n.

Which deduction others (without cause I confess, yet not without scofs) do
sharply reprehend. Nempe Aul Gel. and Lau. Valla, acerrimus Latinae linguae

As though forsooth, Justinian or Sulpitius, had contended to deliver the very
Etymology of the word Testament, and not a certain Allusion rather of the
voice Ita enim conantur hanc notam excusare. Alciatus in L. Tabernae ff. de

When this word Testament is uttered in this general sense, it differs not
from a last will; Bar. in l. j. C. de sasan. eccle. col. pe^. Bal. in L. omne

and any last will, be it a Codicill, or other kind, may be so termed a
Testament, that is to say, a testifying, or declaring of the mind. Glos. in l.
2. de constitu. Pecu C. Bar. Bal. and Lind. vbi supr.
And hence it is that not only in our speech, but in our writings also, we
use the terms of Testament and Last will, indifferently, or one for another.

It is taken strictly, when it is accepted according to that definition
invented by Vlpianus, L. j. ff. de Testam.
hereafter ensuing. Prox.
and being taken in that sense, it differs from a last will, DD post. glos.
in d. l j. ff. de testam.
yet not as opposite thereunto, but as the special differs from the
general, DD. vbi. supr.

The definition of a Testament.
1 What a Testament is.

2 The definition of a Testament unworthily reprehended.

. ij.
A Testament is defined after this manner: Testamentum est voluntatis nostrae
iusta sententia, de eo quod quis post mortem suam fieri voluit. L. j. de Test.
ff.
A testament is a just sentence of our will; touching that we would have done
after our death.

Some there be, who do censure this excellent Accurs. and Paul. de eastr in d.
l. j
though unworthily, Quam viz. definitionem. vtpote perfectissimam, nemini
licere in controuersiam reuocare, refert Michael Grass. Thesaur. com. op.

(but nothing can content a curious head) whose error is detected, and the
definition sustained in the exposition following. nf. prox. n. 19.


A brief exposition of the former Definition.
1 Definitions dangerous in Law.

2 The cause of this danger.

3 It is rare if the definition be so just that it cannot be overthrown.

4 A just or perfect definition profitable to many purposes.

5 The occasion of this exposition.

6 Just, has diverse significations.

7 Just, opposed to that which is wicked.

8 The Testator may not command any thing against justice or equity, etc.

9 Just, taken for full, or perfect.

10 The testament must not be imperfect.

11 Imperfection testamentary twofolde.

12 Testament imperfect in respect of solemnity.

13 What solemnities be requisite in making of Testaments.

14 Testament imperfect in respect of will.

15 Whether the testament being imperfect in respect of will; be void.

16 A further meaning by the word Just, being taken for perfect.

17 Every perfect will is not a perfect Testament.

18 Their error detected who reprehende this Definition.

19 What makes a testament to differ from other kinds of last wills.

20 Of the manifold signification of this word Sentence.

21 Testaments ought to be made with deliberation.

22 Such as have not the use of reason, cannot make a Testament.

23 Unadvised speeches make not a testament.

24 How it may be proved that the Testator had animum testandi.

25 Boasting words do not dispose.

26 Two kinds of judicial sentences, Interlocutory and Diffinitiue.

27 Contrary effects of these two sentences.

28 Testaments compared sometimes to an Interlocutorie sentence, sometime to a
Diffinitiue.

29 The will of the testator, the governor of the testament.

30 The meaning of the testator is to be sought diligently, and kept faithfully.

31 Meaning to be preferred before words.

32 Fear and fraud make void the testament.

33 The Testator must be sui iuris.

34 The testament not to be referred to another man's will.

35 How a testament does differ from other sentences.

36 The Testament is of no force until the Testator be dead.

of a testament above delivered, not being rightly understood, might seem
either more dangerous, or less commodious then it deserves; I thought it
expedient to add this exposition following.

First, whereas a testament is defined to be a Just Sentence, we are to
consider that this word Just, has diverse significations in the law. Sometimes
it is opposed to that which is wicked or Su^ma Hostie^s. tit. de testa.. quid
sit. Sichar. in Rub. de testa. C. n. 2.
Being taken in this L. Nemo de leg j. L filius de cond. inst. ff. Bar. in d L.

For things unlawful are also reputed impossible: and therefore if the
testator should command any such thing in his testament, the same were not to
be observed. L. conditiones L. filius de cond. instit. ff. Summa Hostiens. d.
tit. de testa. quid sit and Rebus. in d. L. iusta.
As if he should will any man to be murdered; for this is against the law of
God: Exodus c. 20.
or if he should command his body to be cast into the river, for this is
against humanity; Quidam ff. de co^d. instit. Sichard. in Rub. de testa. n. 2.
C.
or if he should command his goods to be burned, for this is against policy;
Expedit enim Reipub. ne quis re sua male vtatur,. sed and mayor. instit. De his
qui sui, vel al iu^.
or if he should command any ridiculous act, or prejudicial only to his
own credit and dignity; as if he should will his burial or funerals to be
solemnised with May-games, or Morris daunces, for this were to manifest his
folly, or at least to make question whether he were of sound mind and
memory. d. L. quidam and L. conditiones, el 1. and 2. ff de cond inst.
Sichard. in d. Rub. de testa. C. Cast^ens. in L. Non oportet. C. de his quibus

In these and the like cases the Executor in not performing the commandments
or requests of the testator is not only holden excused, but is highly
commended. d. l. quida^ and ibi Ang. Paul. de castr. and alij, and videas etiam
Mantic. de Coniect. vlt. vol. li 2. tit. 5. n. 9.


Just, is sometimes taken for full or perfect: Bar. in d. L. j ff. de testa
Sichard. in Rub. de testa. C. Couar. in Rub. de testa ext prim. part.
So we say, when a woman has gone her full time with child, (which is
commonly nine months,) Tiraquel. in Rep. L. si vnquam. C. de reuoc. dona.
verb. susceperit. vbi non minus eleganter quam diligenter docet, quamdiu mulier
vterum far valeat.
that she has gone her just time. So we use to say just age for full and
perfect age, L. Filius-familias. de leg. 3. ff. Rebuss. in L iusta. de verb sig.
and so, just weight, just measure, just number; for full and Couar. in Rub.

Civil.
The word Just, being thus understood, that is to say, for full and perfect,
all testamentarie defectes and imperfections, are thereby excluded. Wherefore
the testament ought to be full complete and perfect; otherwise being an
imperfect testament, it is said to be no testaments.. Ex eo instit. Quibus mod.
test. infir.


Solemnity, and in Will or meaning. Bar. and alij in L. hac consultissima.. ex

The testament is imperfect in respect of solemnity, wherein some of the
Legal requisites, necessary in the making of a testament, be wanting.
Sichard. in d.. ex imperfecto.
Hereupon diverse writers, have interpreted the word Just in this definition to
signify Solemn, Viglius in tit. de testa ord. inst. n. 29. Mins. eod. n. 5.
Sichard. in Rub. de testa. C. n. 2.
that is to say, furnished with such due rites and formalities, Iuris Gentium.
Infr. ead part.. 9
So that with us it is sufficient, to the effect of executing the testament,
that the will and mind of the Testator do appear, by two sufficient
witnesses ^ Lindw. in stat^^tum verb. proba. de testa. lib 3. prouincial.
constit. cant.
: Saving where lands, tenements, and hereditaments are devised: for then the
solemnity of writing is also necessary, and that to be done, in the life time
of the testator. Stat H. 8. an. 32. c. prim.
The testament is said to be imperfect Bar. Sichard. and alij in L. Hac
consultissima. ex imperfecto. C de testa. L. si quis ita. ff. eod. tit. L.

If therefore whiles the testator is in making his will, Iul. Clar.. testam. q.
7. in fin.
he be suddenly stricken with sickness, insanity of mind, or other impediment,
whereby he cannot then finish, or perfect the same, as he would, and so die:
This his testament, being imperfect in respect of will, is therefore void,
even touching that which was done, which he did intend then to alter, before he
had made an end d L. si is qui, and L. iuriosu^ Ias. and Sichard. in L. pen. de
Inst. and sub. C.
; by reason of the defect of the testators consent, without which the testament
is not of any value. Sichard in d. L. hac consultissima. ex imperfecto de
testa. C. n. 2.
Nevertheless, not every testament which is termed imperfect in respect of
will, is by and by wholly of no force, for in many cases, yea and for the most
part, such testaments are effectual, for so much as is already done, as
elsewhere more abundantly is confirmed. Infr. part prim. ^^.


There is yet also a further mystery, or secret Just, in that it does
signify full or perfect, which meaning is this: That the testament ought to be
complete, not only in respect of solemnity, and of will, as is aforesaid:
but also that it ought to be perfect in this respect especially, that theris no
want of any thing, which is necessary to the constitution, and denomination of
a testament Bar. in L. j. de testa. ff. Viglius and Minsing. in tit. de testa.

But it cannot be termed a testament, much less a perfect testament. Bar. in
d. L j. de testa. ff. Minsing. in d. tit. de testa. ord.
just because some interpreters did not perfectly apprehend, they did
reprehend the definition, as not perfect nor conuertible with a testament:
that is to say, not agreeable to a testament alone, but common to every kind
of last will: Accurs. and Paul. de castr. in d. L. j. de test. ff.
for that they also were perfect every of them in their several kind. Paul. de
casti. in d. L. pri.
Wherein nevertheless they were deceived, for the perfection that is here
meant, is an absolut perfection, such as none other last will has but only a
testament, even that perfection that gives both name, and nature to a
testament. Bar. (omniu^ Legistarum facillime princeps) Bald. Ange. Imol.

So that the defect was not in the definition, but in their understanding. To
conculde therefore, this perfection specially being here understood by this word
just, which is proper and peculier to a testament, the definition remains
irreprehensible, and is agreeable to a testament only; excluding both Codicil,
Legacy, gift in regard of death, and every other kind of last will, Bar. in d.

time, he does intend to make his executor, or to leave his goods unto; This is

and so not the testament it self, wherein is required present and perfect

. Much less is that to be taken for a testament, when as any man rashely,
bostingly, or iestingly, affirms that he will make this or that man his

. For without meaning, or consent of mind, the testament is altogether without
life; and is no more a testament, then a painted Lion, is a Lion.

Thirdly by this that a testament is termed a sentence, there is a further
consideracion offered to our understanding, in respect of the analogy, betwixt
a judicial sentence and a testament. interlocutory, the other definitive Tit.

beginning and ending of the cause, touching some incident or emergent question
Specul. de sentent. species.
. A definitive sentence is a final decree, whereby the principal cause and
controversy is decided, in condemning or absoluing Specul. vbi supra.
: These two sentences, have these two contrary effects. The one one of the^,
that is to say, the sentence interlocutorie, may be revoked at any time so
long as the principal cause depends undecided L. quod instit. ff. de re.

. The testament of any man, so long as he lives, may be compared to a
sentence interlocutory. For it may be revoked or altered at any time, and as
often as the testator will, whiles he lives, even until the last breath: L. 4.

It follows in the definition (of our will) concerning this word will. It is
written, that the S^chard. in R^b. de te^^a. C. n. 2. in sin.
Because the will does rule and govern the testament, enlarge and restrain
the testament, and in every respect moderate and direct the same, L. in con
licionibus d^ co^d. and de mon. L. si mihi in legate. de leg. j. ff.
and is in deed the very efficient cause thereof. Wesenb. i^ tit. de testa. ff.
The will therefore and meaning of the testator, Vide infr. par. 4.. 4.
it ought to be sought for as earnestly as the hunter seeks his game: Bald
in L. pen. de necess. haered. institu. C. Socin. Iun. cons. 144 vol. 2. n. 23.
And as to the sacred anchor ought nostra instit. de lega.

Labeo. caeterum de sup leg. ff.
(for the tongue is the vtterer or interpreter of the heart, We^ ab. in tit. de

yet cannot every man utter all that he thinks, and therefore are his words
subject to his meaning. And as the mind is before the voice, (for we conceive
before we speak) so is it of greater power; for the voice is to the mind, as
the servant is to his Lord. d L. Labeo.


Where it is said in the definition of our will, the interpreters do gather by
this word our, that the testator ought to enjoy all liberty, and freedom in
the making of his will: that is to say full power and ability, to withstand
all contradicton and countermaund Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib j. tit. 3.

The Definition of a last will.
1 What is a last will.

2 Wherein the definition of a last will does agree, or differ with or from the
definition of a testament.

3 Of the difference betwixt these two words Lawful and Just.

4 Of the difference betwixt these two words Disposition and sentence.

. iiij.
Vltima voluntas est legittima dispositio, de eo quod quis post morte^ fieri
velit. Francis. Mantica de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. j. tit. 4. number. 10.
A last will, is a lawful disposing of that which any iusta sentencia, a just
sentence, which is in the definition of a testament; here is ligitima
dispositio, a lawful disposing Supr. 2. and 3.
. Now if we shall consider the difference betwxit these words, iusta
sententia, and legitima dispositio; then shall we understand the full
difference, betwixt a last will and a testament, (either being understood
according to his difinition) for in the rest both the definitions do agree,
and that which has been or may be said of the one, may also be verifyed of
the other.

Lawful and just, do thus differ. This word lawful has not all the
significations which be included in the word just. For albeit by this word
lawful, is excluded whatsoever is wicked, or whatsoever is contrary to
justice, piety, or equity: or contrary to good and wholesome manners, as well
as by the word just Spiegel Lexic. verb,. legitimum.
, And although the word lawful may also signifye solemn, or furnished with
such due rites as law requires, Gloss. in c. consanguinei de sen. and re.
iud. extr.
as well as in the word just does, albeit also that the word lawful in soome
sense do signify perfect L. Certo. vlt. de serui. rust. praed. verb. legitima
latitudo.
, that is to say, not wanting any thing which the testator meant to utter
Supra. 3. n. 9.
: yet it does not signifye perfect in such an excellent or special sense as
does the word just Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. j. tit. ^n 10.
; that is to say, having such perfection, as is requisite for the form of a
testament, and is proper thereunto; namely the appointing of an Executor, by
the which form a testament differs from all other last wills of what kind
soever they be Supra 3. n. 19.
.

This word dispositio is sometimes taken for Io. Casus Oxon. tractat. dialect.
ij. part. c. 20. 21.
. In this place it does signifye an act proceeding from a firm purpose or
resolution Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. j. tit. 4.
, like as the word sentence in the former difinition Supra 3. n. 20.
. And albeit this word sentence: seem to insinuate a greater heed, or a more
discreet consideration, to be taken in the disposing of that we would have
done after our death, then the nature of this word disposition does enforce:
Yet no last will is of any force, sine animo disponendi, no more then is the
testament sine animo testandi Vide infr. par. j. 13.

The definition of a Codicill.
1 This word Codicill signifies a little book.

2 A Codicill rightly defined.

3 How the definition of a Codicill does agree, with the definition of a
testament or differ from it?

4 The signification of the word just in this definition of a Codicill.

5 A testament is called a great will, and a Codicill a little will.

6 A testament and a Codicill, compared to a ship and a boat.

7 Of the invention of Codicilles.

8 Codicilles may be made in writing, or without writing.

9 Codicilles may be made, either by him which has made a testament, or which
dies intestate.

10 Who must pay the legacies given in a Codicill, by him which dies intestate.

11 Codicills be reputed part of the testament, whether they be made after, or
before the testament.

12 Codicilles and testamentes do agree in the efficient cause: But they have
contrary effects.

. v.
COdicillus, a Codicil, is a diminutiue of Codex Codicillus a codice, Codex
rursus dicitur a caudice, siquidem codex significat contextum tabularum quae
priscis temporibus aptabantur cera ad scribendum, tametsi loco tabularum
pergameni and chartae commodior successerit vsus Olden. de action. class.
quint: in princ. Spiegel. Lexi. verb. codicil.
, a book. And so this word Codicill being rather Latin then English, does
signifye a little book, or writing, Gloss. in Rub. inst. de codicil.
the reason wherefore it is so called does straight ways appear.

A Codicill is diversely defined of diverse. In Sic enim a pletisque definitur,
vt sit vltima voluntas minus solennis absque haeredis institutione. Quae
definitio vix arridet, vt qua vix intelligam, qui differat codicillus a legato,

solennis, nec minus perfecta, quam est codicillus. Paul. de castr. in L. j. de

A Codicill is a just sentence of our will, touching that which any would have
done, after their death, without the appointing of an Executor. Which
definition does agree almost word for word Supr. ij.
, absque Executoris constitutione, without the appointment of an executor. By
force of which words the Codicill is made to differ from a testament: for a
testament can no more consist or be without an Executor, then a Codicill can
admit an Executor Intellige, directo, na^ oblique seu per fidei-commissum

perfection and proper form, whereby a testament differs from all other
kinds of wills De qua supr. 3. n. 19.

does not so much as signify solemn, or furnished with testamentarie rites or
formalities Minsing. Instit. de Codicil.
. For a Codicill is an vnsolemne last will Grass. Thesaur. com. op. Codicil. in

will, was termed a Codicill: that is to say, a little book or a little
writing.

Concerning the diverse kinds of Codicilles, Vasq. de succes. crea lib. 3. 25.

They have diverse contrary effects. For first whereas no man can die with two
testaments, (because the latter does always infringe the former. posteriore

:) Yet a man may die with diverse Codicilles, and the latter does not hinder the
former, so long as they be not contrary L. cum proponat. C. de codicil.
. Another contrary effect is this. If two testamentes be found, and it do
not appear which was the former or latter, both testamentes are void L. vltim
and ibi. DD. de edict diui Adria. toll. C.
. But if two Codicilles be found and it can not be known which was first or
last, and one and the same thing is given to one person in one Codicill, and to
another person in an other Codicill: the Codicilles are not void, but the
persons therein named ought to divide that thing betwixt them Gloss. and DD. in

Finally it is to be noted, that there be diverse words which are common, or
indifferent, either to make a Codicill or a testament. In which case whether
the Judge is to pronounce for a Codicill or a testament, is hereafter discussed

The definition of a Legacy.
1 What is a Legacy.

2 Four things to be considered in this definition.

3 Every legacy proceeds of the liberality of the testator.

4 How a legacy differs from a gift in regard of death, or from other
gifts.

5 Not lawful for the legatarie to take his legacy by his own sole
authority.

6 Legacies paiable as well by the administrator as by the executor.

7 Diverse kinds of legacies in times past.

8 The distinction of legacies confounded.

A Legacy (otherwise termed of our common lawyers a Devise Terms of law,
verb. de vise.
) is a. j. Instit. de lega.
. There be other definitions of a Legacy which I do willingly omit,
because this one is sufficient Constat plures esse Legati definitiones, aliam

. Wherein four

First, in that it is called a gift, it argues that it proceeds of the
mere liberality, and free Minsing. in d. tit. de legate. instit.. j.
.

Secondly in that it is lest, it differs from other time of the Donor: but
also from those gifts which be made in consideration of death, wherein the
things given, are delivered by the testator in his life time, to become their
own to who^ they are delivered in case the testator die. j. Instit de Donac.

Executor, or administrator L. j. Quorum lega. ff L. non dubium. de l^ga C. and
ibi DD. Pa^kins. tit. testa. c. 7. fol. 94. b.
.

And thirdly, because the legacy is to be paid by the Executor or
administrator, (as appears d. L. non dubium and Sichar. ^bid. n. 2.
, (only the executor may of his own auctority enter to the goods and
cattelles of the deceased, Infr. 6. j. and iij.
) otherwise if the legatarie presume to be his own caruer, and do enter to
the possession of the thing bequeathed, without delivery or consent of the
executor, he thereby loses his legacy d. L. non dubium. C. de lega.
: except in certain cases, whereof hereafter Infr. part. 7.. 22. in fin.
. Fourthlie, in that here is mention as well of the administrator as of the
Executor, the meaning is,. non autem Instit. de Codicil.
; which Legacies as they be due, so are they payable in both cases: in the one
by the Executor; and in the other case by the administrator Eod.. non autem.
and L. ab intestat. ff. de iure codicil.
. Nay more then this; if any legacy be left in a testament, although the
executor therein named can not be executor, or do refuse the executorship, and
so the party die in a manner intestate, and thereupon administration of his
goods granted, according to the statutes of this realm Stat. H. 8. an. 21.

Of Solemn Testaments.
1 What is a solemn testament.

2 No use of solemn testaments here in England.

3 The rigor of the civil law concerning testamentes.

4 This rigor justly reformed.

5 What moved Justinian to exact the number of seven witnesses in testamentes.

6 Two or three witnesses sufficient by the law of God.

Solemn testamentes are they, wherein be all those solemnities of the civil
law, (as the presence of vij. witnesses, and required thereunto, their
subscription, their subsignation, the expedition of the act at one time, etc.)
^ Solemn paulatim (...) testa ordin. (...) consul^^s. m^. C^^e testa.

pointing of the finger,) that such a kind of testament there is mentioned in
the Civil law; to were strictly tied, in the making of their testamentes.

these solemnities were omitted, the testament was void L j. de Iniust. rupt.

two or by three witnesses, (the law of God requires no more Deuteronomy. c. 18. Matthew

And I doubt not, but before he did set down so precise a law, he had
sufficient trial of great cunning, and craft practiced, in the making and
proouing of testamentes. (I would there were none in England) which urged him

the plural speech is content with two. Where he says the plural speech is
content with two, which is the reason of the law: It has this sense. It was a
thing very well known, that one witness alone, was not sufficient to decide a
controversy, (the testimony of one being as the testimony of none c. licet

are required; Yet that plural speech, witnesses, is satisfied with two, and so

Of vnsolemne testamentes, and whether the aforesaid definition of a testament
do agree to our testaments in England.
1 What is an vnsolemne testament.

2 Of the freedom we enjoy in England, in making our testamentes.

3 Writing required in the devise of lands.

4 Many things permitted which be not necessary.

5 Whether it be needful that witnesses be required in a testament.

6 Whether our testamentes in England do agree, with the former definition of
a testament.

7 Some reasons whereby it should seem, that the former definition, and our
testaments do not agree.

8 The former definition of a testament, does comprehend both solemn and
vnsolemne testaments.

9 The reasons which prove that this foresaid desinition does comprehend
both testamentes.

10 Vlpian did floorishe before Justinian.

11 The increase or decrease of solemnities do not make the testament to
swerve from the former definition.

12 An vnsolemne marriage is a true marriage, in respect of the knot or essence
of matrimony.

13 A Military testament, though vnsolemne, is properly a testament.

14 A testament amongst children is properly a testament though vnsolemne.

15 A great inconvenience, if an vnsolemne testament were not properly a
testament.

16 What is a testament properly so called?

17 In England our testamentes though vnsolemne, have the effect of testamentes
properly so called.

18 An answer to those reasons, which seem to prove our testamentes do not
agree with the former definition.

19 The former definition is not of any special testament.

: so beneficial are the laws of this realm to the subjects of the same.

But here me thinks a question does offer vnsolemne, and if by the Civil L
j. de iniusto rup. and irrit. testo. ff. L. ex imperfect. L. si vnus. de testa.
C.
: How does the definition of a testament above mentioned, borrowed out of the
Civil law, agree with our testamentes here in England, being al vnsolemne
testamentes? It should seem we had need to seek a new definition, and that I
have erred, together with other our common and temporal lawyers of this
realm, in borrowing that definition, which agrees so just with their
testamentes, with which testamentes our testamentes do not agree. For if the
definition did agree with both testaments, they should agree betwixt
themselves, but the testaments do not agree betwixt themselves; and therefore
the definition does agree but with one alone: If it agree but with the one, and
we confess it does agree with their testaments, how then can it agree with
ours also?

To this question breefely my opinion is this, solemn and vnsolemne
testaments: and therefore is agreeable to our testaments. The antecedent I
prove thus. The Definition (as appears) Vlpian Vlp. in L. j. de testa. ff.
, this Vlpianus is one of Justinian Iustinianus adeptuus fuit Imperium an.
Christi nato 527. Vlpianus autem floruit long ante, nimirum, tempore Alex.
Seueri Imp. To. paulo plus CC. annis post Christum natum. Cagnol. in L. vnic.
si quis ius dice^ti. ff
. Which Justinian did add certain other solemnities: without the which he
ordained, that the testament should be void. sed cum paulatim verb. sed his
Instit. de testa. ordin. L. iubemus. L. cum antiquitas C. de testa.
. It must be granted therefore, that the definition being perfect, before
those new solemnities were devised, and agreeable to those testamentes which
had not these solemnities, because as yet they were not: so now the same
solemnities being taken away, the definition comprehends those testamentes,
which have them not at this present, Eadem enim ratio oppositi in opposito, ac
propositi in proposito. Socin. consil. 16. lib. 3. n. 15. Euerard. loc. a
con^rarijs.
. So that the increasing or decreasing of the number of solemnities, makes not
the testament to come nearer, or depart further from the definition Nam
differe^tia quae est tantum secundum maius and minus, no^ co^stituit diuersas
species, and sic nec diuersas definitiones. L sin. de fu^d. instruct. legate.
ff. Olde^. de culpa.
. Indeed the presence or absence of solemnities make the testament solemn, or
vnsolemne, but Si enim equus caecus sit equus ita vt caecitas non faciat equum
non esse equum, sed no^ esse oculatu^, a fortiori testamenti insolennitas, no^

If an vnsolemne testament were no testament, then testamentum militare, were
no testament: for it is an vnsolemne testament Wesenb. in tit de testa. mil.

. Besides this, if an Instit. de haered. quae ab intestat in princ.
: And dying intestate, then (mark what an inconvenience would follow,) by the
statutes of this realm, the administration of the goods of every man dying
intestate, ought to be committed to the widdowe, or next of kin to the
deceased. But the contrary has been generally observed, that is to say,
where an executor has been appointed, able and willing to undertake the
executorship; there the maker of this will, has been adjudged not to have
dyed intestate, and so the administration of his goods has not been
committed to the widow, or next of kin, according to the statute, although
the testament were vnsolemne, which administation otherwise, ought to have
been committed according to the said statute, as is aforesaid Id quod viridi
obseruac. ficri vbique conspicitur.
. And therefore by common observation also, an vnsolemn testament is not no
testament: but rather even properly a testament. For by the ex testame^to;

. Which effect our vnsolemne testaments have wherein an able and willing
executor is named: For neither he is reputed to die intestat, which appoints
such an executor Hoc nemo nesei^ qui vel mediocriter in alter^t^o ^oro versatur.
, but is plainly, even in laws of strict interpretation (I mean the statuts
of this realm) termed a testator Stat. Ed. 3. an. 4. c. 7. and an. 25. c. 5.
stat: H. 8. an. 21. c. 5. and alijs pene infinitis locis.
: Nether is the administration of his goods committed to the widow, or next of

. But the executor deriuing his auctority from the testator only, does succeed
in the place of the dead man, by force of the testament, according to the
testators meaning and disposition Plowden in casu inter Greisbrook and Fox,
fol. 280. his verbis: Lez executores nosmes sount executores magnetent and
deuant probate del testament, Car le probate nest que confirmation and
allowance de ceo que le testator fist, etc. lit ils poyent executeur deuant.
probate, etc.
. Wherefore an vnsolemne testament, is even properly a testament. Which
conclusion being true, the definition is not more proper to the one, then to
the other.

Now for the answering of the arguments objected. First where it is objected,
that al vnsolemne Vasq. de success. crea.. 11. n. 48.
, how so ever it have not the same effect, to all intentes in law. But if it
be therefore a testament, because it takes effect in law, then are all our
testamentes, (though vnsolemne,) good and sufficient testamentes; because they
have as much force without those solemnities, as if they had them al and C.
more Soarez. lib. recep. sen. verb. testm^. n. 72. Grass. d.. testm^. q. 11.
Clar.. testm^ q. 13. And. Gail. lib. 2. pract. obser. c. 123. Vasq. de success.
crea.. 21. n. 47. Sichard. in L. Hac consul^ss ex imperfecto. C. de testa.
. Secondly, where it is objected, that the definition does agree to their
testamentes; and that their testaments and ours do not agree betwixt them
selves: I answer, that the definition is not of any special testament, the
law, from the which our testamentes do differ: Then could not our testamentes
differing from the testament defined, agree with the definition Quod enim
differt a definito, differt a definitione: vt, quod non est homo, non est
animal rationale. Euerard and Olden. loc. a definicione. lo. Casus Oxon. tract.
de dialect fo. 225.
. But the definition is of a testament which is also common to all those, or
any other kind of testamentes, as well solemn as vnsolemne, as appears
before: and therefore the testament so defined, although it be special in
respect of the definition, yet is it general in respect of the several kind
of testamentes above recited Testm. superius definitum genus est subalternum:
Id quod potest es^e and species and genus diuerso tamen respectu; nimirum
species respectu superioris, id est, sententiae; Genus respectu inferioris, id
est, paganici, and militaris: scripti, and nuncupatiui; solennis, and
insole^nis testamenti. Huiusmodi autem testamenta differu^t non numero sed
specie, and sic testamenta, cuius supra est definitio posita, genus est, quia
praedicatur de pluribus differentibus specie.
, and is verified of every of them; solemn or vnsolemne, and so consequently
is common as well to our testaments as to theirs, distributing both name and
nature to every special testament Id quod est generi proprium. Olde^. Topic
Legal. Loco a genere.
, how so ever they Species namque performa^ discrepat a specie. Conueniunt
autem omnes species in suo genere. Olden. and E^erard vbi supra.
. To conclude therefore, we need not to seek any new definition, but rather
they themselves, by reason of their new solemnities, devised since the making
of the old definition Alciat. in L. j. C. de sacrosanc. eccle. n. 12.
.

Indeed we have not these solemn testaments of the Civil law, but that in
respect we are the more happy, and our law the more godly?

After we have viewed what privileges do belong to Soldiers, it shall be
expedient to show what manner of Soldiers they be to whom these privileges
are granted. Wherefore we are to understand, that there be three milites
armati, armed Soldiers: (such as are above described) the second be milites
literarij, lettered Soldiers, as Doctors of the law: the third sort are
milites caelestes, celestial or heavenly Soldiers, as clergy men and
divines: for so the law does term them Minsing. in Rub. de testa. mil. In.

they do not enjoy the foresaid privileges Sichard. in Rub. de mil. test. C.

Minsing. in Rub. de null. testa. Instit. n. 2.
. Others are of a contrary opinion; Michael. Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. testm^.
q. 4. Alex in d. L. centurio qui tamen alijs fundamentis nititur.
. Much more then (by all probabilities) are those spiritual soldiers worthy
of all privileges by whose prayers and intercessions, the wrath of God is
appeased, and victory many times obtained, and without whose ministry
christianity would quickly be ruinated and subverted Alex. in d. L. centurio.
n. 18.
.

And yet doubtless it is more doubtful in law, whether these military
privileges do appertain to testaments made by clergy men, then if they were
made by lawyers Ripa. in d. L. centurio. ff. de vulg sub. n. 19. post Socin.
Jason. Claud. and alios ibidem. and Mathesilla. not. 61. Grass. Thesaur. com.

. The reason may be, because howsoever deuines be worthy: yet they be
otherwise rewarded, though not in this Vasq. de succesi. c^e a.. 24. n. 31. in

, which reason notwithstanding does not so fully satisfy. For if doctors and
pleaders of the law be therefore priuileged, because they be compared to
soldiers Gloss. and DD. in L. miles. ff. de re. iud. Me^tionem autem feci no^
solum de doctoribus, sed de alijs etiam causidicis, propterea quod licenciati
ratione exercitij priuilegijs militaribus fruuntur. Test Ripa. in d. L
centurio. n. 18.
; for that like valiant champions, by force of learning, strength of wit, and
mighty power of eloquence, they defend their clients causes, against the
subtilties, and injuries of their adversaries: how much more ought our clergy
men divines, our captains in the spiritual warfare of this life, by means of
whose sacred ministry and virtue of whose godly instruction, and might of
preaching that powerful and invincible word: not our purses, nor our bodies,
but even our souls are defended and in safety, against the cruel assaults
of that bloody and mortal enemy of man kind, (who seeks by all malicious
means, like a roaring lion whom he may devour) and against his huge host of
wicked spirits, who never rest day nor night, nor minute of an hour, but
still strive with might and maine to overthrow us, and to bring us all to
everlasting destruction: how much more, I say, are these our captains in these
so terrible conflicts, to be gratified and dignified, with all manner of
military privileges Arg. a min. ad ma.
. Wherefore if the matter rest upon the issue of desert and worthiness,
without doubt of these three forenamed soldiers; the divine is not the last,
but the foremost. Concerning the other two, (the lawyer I mean and the
soldier) whether of them deserves better of the common wealth, and whether is
to be preferred before the other, is a question so incident to this
controversy, and cleaves so close thereunto, that there be few writers
which handle the one, but they also touch the other Alex. Ias. Ripa. in d L.

Comparisons be odious. For mine own part, if you will give me leave, I will
tell you a tale out of Zasius Zas. in L. miles. de re. iud. ff. n. 8.
, writing upon this Q. which shall be as true as any is in Aesops fables. A
certain painter (says he,) meaning by his art to describe the strength of
man, did paint a little man riding upon a huge lion, as if a man were stronger
then a lion. A lion passing by, demanded of the painter, wherefore he made
such a picture. Because (quoth the painter) my man is able to tame any lion, as
easily as a horse or an ass. Well sir said the lion, if we could painte, thou
should see a lion devouring a painter. Eloquent men are as painters, valiant
soldiers as lions: hither to in jest: But now in earnest, yet without
offense. It is not the golden chain, nor the plume of feathers, nor the big
looks, nor the proud bragges, which make a right soldier Zas. in d. L miles.
n. 5
. Neither is it the long gown nor the grave beard, nor the stately gesture
which make a good lawyer Cucullus non sacit monachum.
. The counterfeit of either deserves no honor: be he never so brave, never
so grave. If both be as they should, the praeeminence in matters of war is
the soldiers; in matters of peace it is the lawyers Zas. in d. L. centurio. n.
20. Alex. in eand. L. n 14. Gail. lib. 2. pract. obser. n. 8. n. 16.
. In other matters, he is the more honorable, which does more honor the
other. To return to the former question, whether these soldier like lawyers
may challenge these former testamentarie privileges: we are to distinguish
betwixt privileges granted to soldiers, (so properly called) in respect of
their want of skill and ignorance in matters of that quality, (for such do
not belong to the learned;) and privileges of prerogative or deserte. For these
kinds of privileges belong also to doctors and clergy men DD. in L. miles. and

1 What is a testament amongst children.

2 That testament is presumed last which is made in favor of children.

3 If two testamentes be found, and it do not appear which is first or last,
neither is good.

4 The testament made in favor of children, is not so easily revoked as an
other testament.

5 What manner mention is to be made in the latter testament, to take away the
former made in favor of children.

6 Certain cases wherein the testament made in favor of children, may be
taken away by the second, without any mention of the former.

7 Whether a testament may be proved which has no witnesses of the making
thereof.

8 The privilege of proof without witnesses, whether it be peculiar to one
kind of testament?

THe second kind of priuileged testaments is, testamentum inter liberos; a
testament amongst children Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 1. tit. 7. in fin.
: that is L. ex hac consultissima.. ex imperfecto. C. de testa. and ibi DD.
, unto which kind of testament diverse privileges do d.. ex imperfecto. and L.

the testator, of diverse tenores, and it does not appear which of them is the
latter testament, in this doubt that testament is presumed the latter, and so
shall prevail, which is made in favor Bar. in L. j.. j. de bon. poss. secudu^

or some like cause have come to pass, whereby it may appear that the father
did repent him of the making of his said will. Grass. ibidem.


An other privilege granted by the civil law, to fathers testaments amongst
his children is this, that the same may take effect, albeit Bald. Paul. de
castr. and Ias. in Auth. quod sine C. de testa.
. Howbeit I do suppose that by the general custom of this realm of peculier
to fathers testaments alone, but that the same are common to al other English
men's testaments, and namely the latter privilege: when it does appear
undoubtedly, to be written or subscribed with the testators own hand, or is
proved that the testator caused the same to be written by another. How this
proof is to be made, that the testament is written or subscribed with the
testators own hand, is declared in another place Infr. part. 4.. xxv.
.

Other privileges there be, whereby these kinds of testamentes are free, from
sundry observations and solemnities, wherewith other testamentes are charged.
But because they are also

Of a testament ad pias causas.
1 A testament ad pias causas may be so termed either in respect of persons or
places.

2 A testament ad pias causas may be made by straung and unaccustomed notes.

3 A testament ad pias causas being found cancelled, is not presumed to be
advisedly cancelled by the testator.

4 In a testament ad pias causas whether the condition ought to be observed
precisely.

5 A testament ad pias causas is not void by reason of vncertaintye.

6 Whether all privileges which belong to a militarye testament, or to a
testament amongst the testators children, do also belong to a testament ad
pias causas?

7 What if there appear two priuileged testaments, and it does not appear
which is later, whether, shall be preferred.

. xvj.
THe third kind of priuileged testaments, is that testament ad pias causas
Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 1. tit. 7. in fin. and in lib. 6. tit. 3.
: Which is so termed not miserable persons:) but also in respect of places: as
when the same is left to hospitalles, to churches, to repairing of high ways,
bridges, walls of a town or city when the same be decayed; and stand in
need to be repaired Lindw. in c. ita quorundam verb. pias causas de testa.
lib. 3. prouincial. constituc. Cant. and latissime Tiraquel. tract. de

enumerat 170. priuilegia piae causae, quarum tamen long maxima pars competit
singulis Anglorum testame^tis, etiamsi non sint condita ad pias causas.
.

One privilege is, that this kind of testament the same is as effectual as if
it had been written after the usual and accustomed manner Mantic. de
coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 6. tit. 3. n. 3. Tiraquel. de priuileg. piae causae. c.
12. vide inf par. 4. 25.

ad pias causas be found cancelled and it is not known, whether the testator
did willingly and wittingly cancel the same; the law does presume it to be
cancelled unadvisedly Couar. in Rub. de testa. 3. part. n 19. Grauetta. consil.
128. M^ntic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 12. tit. 1. n. 32.
, and so it is in effect, as if it had not been cancelled at all, whereas in
other testaments, the contrary is presumed: that is, that the testator did
wittingly and willingly, cancel the same Alex. consil. 104 n. 6 vol. 7.
Mantic. de coniect. vlt vol. lib. 12. tit. 1. number. 30.
: whereby they are made void, as afterward is declared Infr. part. 7.. 16.
.

An other privilege is, that for the obtaining of any thing left
condicionallie ad pias it is sufficient the condition be accomplished by other
means, then according to the precise form of the condition Tiraquel. de
priuileg. piae causae. c. 83.
: Whereas in other testamentes or legacies, it is not sufficient, unless the
condition be preciselye observed L. M^uius. L. qui haeredi de cond. and demo^.
ff. vide inf. par 4.. 7.
.

ad pias causas is not void in respect of uncertainty, (as other testamentes
are:) and therefore if the testator say, I make the poor my executors, or I
will that my goods be distributed amongst the poor: suc^ manner of
appointing Executors or legacies is not void ^ar. and Ias in ^^^j C. de
sac^^sa. e^cle. ^rass. Thesaur. com. op.. Institut. q. 1^.
.

amongst his children, in respect of the solemnities to be observed in the
making of testamentes Iure civilly non valet testm^ ad pras causas, absque
solennitatibus conditum, lecus iure com. modo adhibeatur solen. si^as iuris

; that the same do also appertain to a testament ad pias causas, saving in
some cases, and namely, where the privileges of both the former kinds of
privileges be contrary, as where two testamentes be extant, and it does not
appear which is former or latter. In which case it seems, that if they be
military testamentes, that then they are both good, otherwise they are both
void Supr., 14.
: But if the one of them be ad pias causas, then that is presumed last and so
available, the other not being priuileged Ias. and Sichard, in L. fin G. de
edict. D. Adrian. tollend.
.

But what if both testamentes be priuileged, inter liberos, the other ad pias
causas, and it does not appear, which is former or latter; which shall
prevail? I suppose that which is inter liberos Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol.
lib. 6. tit 3 n. 13.
, for the children are to succeed in case both the wills were void Bar. in
L. j.. de bon. poss. secundum tab. ff. stat. H. 8. an. 21. c. 5.

. How be it, it seems that if the testament were not in favor of his
children, but of some other of his kin; that then the testament ad pias

their favor to be the latter Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 6. tit. ^. n.

IN the second part of this Testamentarie treatise, shall be declared (God
willing) what person may make a testament, and who may not so do.

Wherein it may be set down for a rule, that every person (both man and
woman, Christian and Jew, sound or sick; and generally of what state or
condition so ever he, or she be) has full power and liberty to make a
testament or last will Instit. Quibus non est permissam testa. fac. in prin.

Therefore if we shall diligently examine, what persons are forbidden by law
or by custom, it will easily appear who they are that can make a testament,
or dispose of their goods and cattelles. And albeit many persons are Bar. and

Of mad folks and lunaticke persons.
1 Mad and Lunaticke persons cannot make a testament, and what is the reason.

2 Whether the testament made in the time of furour be good when the testator
is come to himself.

3 A testament may be made by a Lunaticke person, betwixt his fittes.

4 Every one is presumed to be of perfect mind and memory, until the
contrary be proved.

5 He that obiecteth insanitie of mind must prove the same.

6 Whether it be sufficient to prove that the testator was mad before the
making of the will.

7 Whether he that is once mad be presumed so to continue.

8 Insanity of mind hard to be proved.

9 Witnesses must yield a reason if they will prove a man to be mad.

10 Arguments of madness.

11 Whether a general reason suffice to prove insanitie of mind.

12 Whether madness may be proved by singular witnesses.

13 Those witnesses are to be preferred, which depose that the testator was of
sound mind.

14 What if the testament be made by a lunatike person, and the time of the
making unknown, whether is the testament good or no?

15 What if it cannot be proved that the testator had quiet intermissions.

16 What if there be a mixture of wise things and folish in the testament.

make his testament after this furor have over taken him, and whiles as yet it
does possess his mind, albeit the furor afterward departing or ceasing,
the testator recover his former understanding: yet does not the testament made
during his former fit, recover any force or strength d. L. furiosum. C. qui

prove the same, it shall not be amiss, to set down some observations

At Paris one morning a hungry poor man begging his alms from door to
door, did at the last epsy very good cheer at a cooks house: whereat by
and by his teeth began to water, and the spur of his empty and egar
stomach pricking him forwards, he made as much have toward the place as
his feeble feet would give him leave, where he was no sooner come, but the
pleasant smell partlye of the meat partly of the sauce, did catch such sure
hold of the poor man's nose, that (as if he had been fast holden with a pair
of pinsers) he had no power to pass from thence, until he had (to stay the
fury of his raging appetite) eaten a piece of bread, which he had of charity
gotten in an other place. In the eating whereof his sense was so delighted with
the fresh smell of the cooks cates, that albeit he did not lay his lips to
any morsel thereof: yet in the end his stomach was so well satisfied with the
only smell thereof, that he plainly acknowledged himself thereby to have
gotten as good a breakefast, as if he had in deed there eaten his belly full
of the best cheer. Which when the cook had heard, being an egregious wrangler
and an impudent companion, what does he but all hastily steps forth to the
poor fellow, lays fast hand upon him, and in a whote choleric mood, bids
him pay for his breakefast. The honest poor man half amazed at this straung
demand, wist not well what to say: but the cook was so much the more fierce
and earnest, by how much he perceived the good man to be abashed at his
boldness, and did so cunningly cloak the matter, that in the end the poor
man was contented to refer the deciding of the controversy to whatsoever
person should next pass by that way, and without any more ado to abide his
judgment. Which thing was no sooner concluded, but by and by comes unto the
place, a very natural fool and such an notorious idiote, as in all Paris his
like was not to be found. All the better for me thought the cook, for more he
doubted the sentence of a wise man then of a fool. Well sir, to this foresaid
judge they rehearsed the whole fact, the cook cruelly complaining, and the
other patiently confessing as before. A great multitude of people were gathered
about them, no less desirous to know what would follow, then wonderinge at
that which had gone before. To conclude, this natural perceiving what money
the cook exacted, caused the poor man to put so much money betwixt two basins,
and to shake it up and down in the cooks hearing, which done, he did
arbitrate and awarde, that as the poor man was satisfied with the only smell
of the cooks meat, so the cook should be recompensed with the only noise of
the poor man's monye. Which judgment was so commended, that who so heard the
same, thought, if Cato or Solomon had been there to decide the controversy,
they could not have given a more indifferent or just sentence.

Bononia And. Barl a. in d. c. ad nr^am. de consuetud. extr. n. 8.
. There a certain covetous man lost his purse, with 21. ducates in it, which
when he could not recover with diligente search, he fared like a mad man,
and in the end was ready to have hanged himself for sorrow. An other honest
man having found such a purse, moved with compassion came and delivered the
same to this covetous person, who never thanking the bringer, fell forthwith to
telling of the money, and finding but 20. ducates therein, with great
greediness he exacted the odd ducate: which because the finder denied, he is
brought before the magistrate, a man of very great wealth, but of very little
wit (but such magistrates are many times elected, where the matter lies in the
mouths of the multitude.) The one party swears, that there were 21. ducats
in the purse which he lost. The other party swears, that there were but 20.
ducates in the purse which he found. The magistrate although a fool, gives
no foolish sentence, for he pronounced that the purse which was found, was not
that purse which was lost, and therefore condemned the covetous person to
restore the 20. ducates to the other party.

By these reasons and examples, therefore it may be reasonably inferred, that
if a fool do make a wise and reasonable testament, the same ought to be
allowed as lawful.

Nevertheless this is the truer opinion, that such a testament is not good in
law Ias. and Dec. in L. futiosi. C. qui testa. fac. poss.
, the reason is, because a testament is an act to be performed with discretion
and judgment Supr. prim. part.. 3. verb. Senten.

very natural fools and idiotes, that they do well perceive, and understand
what they speak: yet because this thing happens but very seldom, the law
does not presume the same by occasion of words only Dec. in d. L. furiosi.
and in L. in negotijs de reg. iur^f.
. And therefore unless further proof be made thereof, by other
circumstances, the law does not approve such testamentes.

Of slaves and villeines.

4 Whether the children of bond parents, be subject to servitude.

5 By the civil law the child is free, if the mother be free,
notwithstanding the bondage of the father.

6 By the laws of this realm the child is freeborne whose father is free,
though the mother be a bond woman.

7 No bastard is borne a slave, though the father be a bondman.

8 A bondman cannot make a testament.

9 Of the difference betwixt a bond-slaue and a villeine.

10 A villeine, like unto him which is called in the civil law Ascriptitius
Glebae.

11 Whether a villeine may make a testament.

12 The Lord may take from his villeine, whatsoever he has, life excepted.

13 The testament of the villeine is not void, but voidable.

14 Sometimes the Lord can not make void the testament of his villeine.

15 The Prince may at any time make void the alienation or gift of his
villeine, and consequently his testament.

16 What manner villeines be here meant?

: the equity of which prohibition, (If I may be so bold with the good favor
of our temporal lawyers, to insert the reason and consideration of the civil
law) is not obscure. For if this gappe were left open, few children should
succeed in the mothers inheritance L. 1. 2. 3. ff de donac. inter vir. and vx.
: But by how much the husband were more cruel, and the wife more timorous, he
crafty, she credulous, by so much the more were the lawful heir in danger to
be disherited, and the cruel and deceitful husband in hope to be vnworthilye
enriched and advanced. Wherefore if the wife should devise any her manors,
lands, tenements, or hereditaments or any part thereof to her husband, this
devise were void, because the same is presumed to have been made by
constrainte of the husband, or other sinister means Brook. vbi supra.
. Secondly, Ita saepius accepi a nonnullis huius regni iurisperitis, non

Thirdly, albeit the testament be made Arg.. alio. Institu. quib. mod. testa.

: for it is necessary to the validity of a testament, that the testator have
ability to make a testament, not only at the time of the making thereof, when
the testament receives his essence or being: but also at the time of the
testators death, when the testament receives his strength and confirmation.

, (except in certain Hoc ipso.. n. 11. cum sequen.
) because by the laws and customs of this realm, so soon as a man and a
woman be married, all the goods and cattels personal that the wife had at the
time of the spousals, or celebration of the marriage, or after Tract. de repub.
Ang. lib. 3. c. 6. Doct. and Stud. lib. 1. c. 7.
, and also the cattelles real, if he over live his wife; belong to the
husband, by reason of the said marriage Doct. and Stu. lib. 1. c. 7
: and therefore with good reason she can not give that away which was hers
without the sufferance or grant of the owner: L. id quod nostrum. de reg. iur.

c. Ratishibitio. de reg. iur. 6.
, and the property of authority, or auctorizable consent is to concur with
the act Tiraquel. de legib. Conub. gloss. 4. in prin.
: yet by the laws of this realm, if a wife make a testament of her husbands
goods, the husband not understanding thereof, and after her death the executors
prove the same, if the husband deliver the goods devised in the will to the
executor, thereby he has made the testament good, notwithstanding he were not
privy to the making thereof Perkin. tit. devise. c. 8. fol. 97. Tiraquel. vbi

consent in the beginning, at the time of the will making. And therefore the same
being proved and the goods delivered accordingly, it is the^ too late for him
Perkin. vbi supr.
. Albeit otherwise, if the husband do give license to his wife, to make a will
of his goods, yet he may revoke the same, not only at the making of the will,
but after her death, at the least before the will be proved Brook. Abridg. tit.

. Fourthlie if the wife be executrix Fitzherb. Abridg. tit. exec. n. 40.
Brook. eod. tit n. 11. Perkins. tit. de use. c. 8. fol. 97.
: the reason is because such goods as she has as executrix, Latius inf. par.
6.. j.
: and therefore if the executrix should make no executor but die intestate,
administration might be obtained of the goods not administered by the next of
kin of the testator deceased Plowden in cas. inter Greisbrook and Fox.
, (for where an executor dies intestate, the testator from that time is
esteemed to die intestate Brook Abridg. tit. administrator. n. 45.
,) so far is it from the husband to have any of those goods whereof his wife
is executrix; much like unto that lord whose villeine is executor, in which
case he can not take from his villeine that which did belong to the testator,
but his villeine may have an action against him for the same and may recover
both the goods and damages, (as has been said before. Supr. ead. part..
viij. n. 18.
) Although otherwise whatsoever does appertain to the villeine, the lord may
take the same from him, Olde^ tenures. tit. villenage.
. Furthermore it is not only lawful for the wife being executrix to make a
testament without her husbands license, Brook Abridg. tit. exec. n. 11.
. Howbeit this positio^, that the wife being executrix, may make her will of
those goods whereof she is executrix, without her husbands license is restrained
in two cases: the one is when she does not make an executor, but bequeatheth
the goods whereof she is executrix, Plowd. in casante^ Bransby and Grantham.
fol. 525 imo nec cum consensu marits, potest legare testatoris bona.
. The other is, when she is not only executrix, but legatary also, and has
accepted of the thing bequethed, not as executrix but as legatary Infr. hoc
ipso.. n. 21.
. In these two cases the will of his dettes performaunce of his will, and to
other charitable uses c. statutum. lib. 3. prouincial. constituc. Cant. Plowd.

: and therefore may not give or devise the same by legacy, for that were to
dispose of the testators goods, as if they were the proper goods of the
executor, and to convert the same to the private use of the legatary Plowden.
vbi supr. facit. c. filius. de testa. ext.
, and not to the use of the testator. But when an executor does only make an
other executor, the second executor does stand chargeable and accomptable for
the distribution of the first testators goods to the use of the same testator,
as did the former executor, and is by the laws of this realm reputed for the
executor, not of the executor, but of the former testator Brook Abridg. tit.
execut. n. 132. and infr. par. 6.. j. and. iij tu vide Bar. in L. veluti. ff.

; so is not a legatarie. The reason of the second L. legatum. de leg. 2. L. a
Titio de furtis ff.
, and not to the use of the testator: and the wife being not only executrix,
but legatarie also; accepting of the thing bequeathed, not as executrix, but as
legatarie; does thereby make it her own proper goods, and consequently her
husbands: For that which is the wives, is by reason of the marriage her
husbands, and being invested in him Tract. de repub. Ang. lib. 3. c. 6.
, (as has been said before:) cannot be given from him without his license
or consent L. id quod nostrum. de reg. tur. ff.
. Great difference there is therefore betwixt these two cases, of accepting the
thing bequethed as executrix, or as a legatarie, for in the one case it is not
her husbands, and so she may make a testament thereof, by appointing an executor
to distribut the same to the use of the first testator Brook. tit. exec. n. 11.
: and in the other case it is her husbands; and so she can not make any
testament of the same without his license Supr. eod..

and so no testament at all should take place; or if the former testament were
not revoked by the latter, as being unlawful, then it must be granted that a
testament may take place not only without the will, but even against the will

Of an Apostata.
1 An Apostata can not make a testament.

2 An Apostata worse then an heretic.

3 Who is an Apostata.

4 The state of the heretic and of the Apostata damnable.

5 Three kinds of Apostasy.

6 Every Apostatae is not intestable.

or a Turk, or some other infidel approouing their detestable rites, and
superstitions: whereas an heretic, albeit he do obstinately persevere in his
error; yet he erreth not wholly, but particularly in some part of christian
religion Summa Hostiens. tit. de haere. and de Aposta.
. Both in truth are abominable 2. epistol. Petr. c. 2. verse. 21. epist. Paul.
ad Hebraeos. c. 6. verse. 6.
; worthily therefore is the Apostata to be as severely punished, as an
heretic Panor. in c. 1. de apostat. ext.
.

There be three kinds of Apostasy: Persidiae, one of misbeleefe, an other of
disobedience, the third of irregularitie Summa Hostiens. tit de aposta.. quot
species.
. Apostasy of misbeleefe is where a man does utterly forsake the christian
belief, as mention is made before: so did Julian the Apostata. Apostasy of
disobedience is, when the subject refuses to obey the lawful commandment of
his ordinary or superior Summa Hosticas. d. tit. de aposta. epist. ad Hebr. c.
13. verse. 17.
: and so do many Anabaptists at this day. Apostasy of irregularity is, when
he that has entered into the ministry and taken holy orders, forsakes his
spiritual profession; and becomes not in habit c. a nobis. de aposta. extr.
: But I suppose that an Apostata from obedience, or from spiritual profession,
is not disabled to make his testament Bar. in Rub. de aposta. C.

Of Usurers.
1 A manifest usurer can not make a testament.

2 Every usurer is not intestable.

3 Who is a manifest usurer.

4 Whether one act may make an usurer to be manifest.

5 Whether he be an usurer which lends for gain, but does not receive any
more then the principal.

6 An usurer is not intestable in England, unless he take above 10. in the

hundredth for a years forbearance, or under that rate, he shall only forfeite
so much as shall be reserved or received by way of usury above the principal
Ibidem.
: but if any shall receive above that rate, he does not only loose his
principal together with the interest, but is also to be punished and corrected
according Eod. stat. Eliz. an. 13. c. 8.
. By the which laws ecclesiastical, if any be a manifest usurer, not only
his testament is void, as is aforesaid, but his body after he be dead is not
to be buried amongst the bodies of other christian men, in any church or
churchyard, until there be restitution or caution tendered according to the
value of such goods d. c. quanquam. de vsur. 6.

deemed, for no testament, when the sick person answers, yea, the
interrogation beeinge made by a suspected person; as well in respect of
presumption of deceit in the one, as of defecte of meaning of making of a

But what if a will be brought to the sick man, which being read over in
his hearing, and he demanded whether the same shall stand for his last will
and testament; answers yea: and it does not appear whether the same was
written and prepared by the direction of the sick man, or else of his
kinsfolks and frindes, whether is it to be presumed, to have been prepared by
his direction or by theirs? It seems by the sick man, in favor of the
testament Alex. consil. 33. vol. 3. Gabr. lib. 4. tit. de testa. concl. 2. n.

albeit the testator being interrogated do answer as before, it is presumed
that the question was made by the suggestion or of the executor Mantic. de

Of Ecclesiastical persons.
1 Two sorts of Ecclesiastical persons, regular, and secular.

2 Who are meant by regular persons.

3 Religious persons compared to bondmen.

4 Religious persons compared to dead men.

5 Who be here meant by secular clerks.

6 Ecclesiastical persons are not simply prohibited to make their testamentes.

7 Ecclesiastical persons may make their testamentes of all goods, which they
have not in right of their church.

8 Ecclesiastical persons can not make their testamentes of things
immovable, which they possess in right of their church.

9 An Ecclesiastical person may make his testamente of the glebe by him sown.

10 Whether an ecclesiastical person may make his testament of the fruits not
received.

11 All fruits which happen during the vacation, are due to the next incumbent.

12 Whether an ecclesiastical person may make his testament of all moveable
goods, which he has in right of his church.

13 Some cases wherein ecclesiastical persons cannot dispose of their goods.

Of Kings.
1 Examples borrowed out of the old testament, whereby it may seem lawful
for kings to give away their kingdoms.

2 Certain humane reasons, tending to the same purpose.

3 Other examples taken out of profane histories of Kings, which have
disposed of their kingdoms by their testamentes.

4 By the civil and cannon laws, a King can not give away his kingdom.

5 Whether by the laws of this realm, a King may give away his kingdom.

6 An uncertain conclusion.

. xxviii.
IT may seem lawful for a king by his testament, to make his heir whomsoever
he shall think good, or to leave his kingdom to whom he will, both by gods
law and man's law.

principallitie or government of the Isralites to Joshua Deutero. c. vlt. verse.

. The holy Patriarch Jacob also, even he that wrastled with an angel Genes. c.
32. verse. 24. etc.
, deprived his eldest son Ruben of his birth right, and gave the same to the
sons of Joseph Genes. c. 49. Paralip. c. 5. in princ.

By man's law, because the voice and will. sed and quod. Instit. de iur. na.

; because also a king is said to be a mortal God Bald in. praeterea. de prohib.

. To be short, if a king might not dispose of his own kingdom at his own
pleasure, then his state were not so good as the state of his subject Oldrad.
consil. 94 in fin.
, for the meanest subject may freely dispose of his own Supr. ead. part. in

. Besides which urgent reasons, whereby appears the root and life of this
human law, there be sundry pregnant examples, which as branches springing
from that lively root, have in sundry ages and countries brought forth
fair and goodly fruit; whereby the force and efficacy of that law has
been made manifest to all the world; let these few suffice for a taste. It is
recorded that Attalus a king in Asia the less, did in his testament institute
the Roman people his heir, who by virtue of that testament did enioie the
kingdom Florus lib. 2. Hottoman. illustr. quaest. c. 1.
: likewise that Alexander king of Egypt, did bequeath unto the same Roman
people the kingdoms of Alexandria and Egypt Cicero Ora. 1. pro lege agrar.

, Ptolemaeus the king of Egypt gave away the kingdom of the Cyrens Hottoman.
d. c. 1.
, Vnguinus was king of the Goths by the appointment of Haldanus Eodem loci.
: To come nearer (I mean in respect of place not of time) we may read how
Prasutagus, one of the kings of this realm of England, a little after the
death of Christ, did make the Emperor Nero his heir Cornel. Tacitus. lib. 14.
Camden. fol. 290. alias fol. 355.
: And diverse other kings have done the like Quorum meminit Gentilis disp. 2
fol. 45.
. So that it is neither new or strange, that kings have by their testamentes
given away their kingdoms from those, who otherwise should have enjoyed the
same.

the examination of this deep and dangerous question, much less to proceed
to the conclusion; not only because the same being so high an object, does
far exceed the slender capacity of a mean subject: but also for that this
princely controversy, as it has seldom received ordinary trial
heretofore; so hereafter if the case were to be argued in very deed, very
likely it is to be urged with more violent arguments and sharp syllogismes,
then by the unbloody blows of bare words, or the weak weapons of
instruments made of paper and parchment: And on the other side to be answered
with flat denials of greater force, and distinctions of greater efficacy,
then can proceed from any legal or logical engine; and in the end to be
decided and ruled by the dead stroke of uncivil and martial cannons, rather
then by any rule of the civil or cannon law.

WHAT THINGS ARE EXAMINED IN THE THIRD PART.
The third part.
1 The third principal part divided into two members.

2 The first member three-foulde.

. j.
IN the third part of this Testamentarie treatise, there is to be showed,
first what things, and then how much the testator may dispose, or devise by
his testament.

Concerning the former of these, it shall not be a miss to speak first of the
bequeathing or devising of lands, tenementes, and hereditaments Infr. ead
part.. 2, 3, 4.
.

Secondly of the bequeathing or devising of goods and cattelles Infr. ead.
par.. 5, 6.
, and thirdly of the committing of the tuition of children, and custody of
their portions and rights, during their minorities Infr. ead. part.. 7, 8, etc.
.

Of the devise of lands.
1 The rule of the devise of lands is negative.

2 The exceptions of this rule are of two sorts.

. ij.
TRue it is, that this matter of the devise of lands, tenementes and
hereditamentes, which in this realm of England with all questions incident
thereunto, is to be determined according to the laws temporal of this realm;
and is not subject to the rules and decisions of the laws civil or
ecclesiastical: lest therefore whilst I would seem a mere professor of the
civil law, I might seem altogether to neglecte both law and civility, by
thrusting my sickle into an others harvest, and setting my foot in an others
possessions without license first obtained: for the avoiding of this offense,
before I go any further, I am to crave this favor (learned professors and
serious students of the laws temporal of this realm,) that for as much as this
your field, wherein grows all these questions concerning the devise of
lands, does lie so just betwixt me and those other grounds, wherein the
mark whereat I aim, is placed, and wherein the fruit which I would gladly
utter is planted: so that I can not (as now my journey lies) have ready
access unto the one but through the other: It would therefore please you give
me a little leave to walk through a corner of your large dominions, unto
those foresaid places, more proper to them of mine own profession. (Your
territories I confess are very fertile, and full of hidden treasure, the
fruit also of that soil, I mean the golden cases much like the golden fleece
of Colchos: the growing very pleasant and profitable: Howbeit you need not be
afraid of any prejudice, for neither will I disturb your quiet possession with
any long abode: neither ca^ I if I would, co^ueigh away the riches you should
reap, by disclosing of the mysteries of your gaineful art to me unknown,
unless I would seem to be more bold then blind baiarde, more arrogant then the
ignorant Cobbler, who for his sauciness received this admonition: Ne suitor
vltra crepidam.) And further that as a poor passenger, I may be allowed to
take a taste of those things which you have set abroache to all the world, and
which by your sundry books you have made common to all travelers, the rather
for that I am prepared in some sort to requite the same. This only I desire,
and this I hope you will not deny, to the purpose therefore.

Touching the bequest or devise of lands, tenementes and hereditamentes, this
appears to be a true position, and ground agreeable to the civil law c.
imperialis. de prohib. feud. alien. lib. 2. Feud. Bald. in c. 1. de success.
feud.
, and also the laws of this realm Stat. H 8. an. 27. c. 10. in princ. Doct.
and Stud. lib. 1. c. 8. Perkins. tit. devise. 102.
, that lands, tenementes or hereditamentes, can not be disposed or devised by
will, but in certain cases, of which some are approved by force of certain
customs Infr.. prox.
, within this realm; and some by force of certain statutes Infr. ead. par.. 4.
.

Certain cases approved by custom, wherein it is lawful to devise lands,
tenementes, or hereditaments.
1 Gauelkinde lands may be devised by will.

2 The cause wherefore the custom of Gauelkinde did continue.

3 Burgage land deuiseable by will.

4 To whom and after what manner Burgage lands be deuiseable.

5 Whether any other person may devise Burgage lands but a citizen.

6 Burgage tenure a kind of tenure in Soccage.

7 Whether liuerie or seasin be needful, where burgage land is devised.

8 Whether the Iointenaunt may bequeath his part of Burgage land otherwise
deuiseable.

9 Of lands devised to certain uses.

10 The custom of devising lands to feoffes reformed.

11 The causes of this reformation.

12 The statute or act of reformation.

. iii.
THe first case wherein by custom of this realm of England, it is lawful for
a man by his last will or testament, to devise or bequeath lands, tenements
or hereditame^ts, is this, namely, when lands, tenements or hereditaments, are
holden Dyer. fol. 153 verb. devise. Terms of law. verb. Grauelkind and ita

, (the same otherwise being William duke of Normandy, had invaded and
conquered all England, Kent only excepted, at last also the kentish-men
yielded, but upon condition that they might enjoy their ancient customs of
Gauelkind, which was granted unto them, and since has continued Lambert.
perambulation of Kent. fol. 23.
: amongst which customs, being very large and benificiall, this is one; that
they which hold lands in Gauelkinde, may give and sell the same, without

due out of the same tenementes Terms of law* vbi supr. Lambert. vbi supr. fol.

Fitzherb. Not. Bre. ex graui querela. in prin. Doct. and Stud. lib. 1. c. 7.
and 10.
. For it is the custom of diverse Cities and Borroughes of this land, (as in
London, York, Oxford, etc.) that such persons as are seized of lands,
tenementes, or hereditamentes, lyinge and being in such cities or boroughes,
and hold the same in burgage tenure, may by their testamentes or last wills,
give or bequeath the same to whom they will Brook. Abridg. tit. devise. n. 22.

the goods and cattelles bequeathed in the same, and enrowled before the mayor

are bequeathed Brook Abridg. tit. devise. n. 43.

case, that the testator should be a citizen, or burgess of that city or
boroughe, where the lands or tenementes devised do lie: but it is sufficient,
if the lands and tenementes be holden in burgage Brook tit. devise. n. 22
: For that not he only is said to hold in burgage, who is a citizen or
burgess of the place where the lands or tenementes be, and holds of the
king, or other lord lands or tenementes lying in the city or borough,
yielding therefore to his said lord a certain yeerelie rent: but he also that

the lands and tenementes within the same be deuisable by testament, if one of
the said iointe tenauntes devise that which to him belongs, by testament and
die, this devise or legacy is void Principal grounds. fol. 20. b.
: The reason is, for that no devise can take effect till after the death of the
testator, who did bequeath and devise the same, but by his death all the land
does incontinently by the law of this realm, come to the suruiuor, who
neither claims nor has any thing by devise but of his own right by the
suruiu^ir according to the course of the law of this land, and for this cause
such devise is void Principal grounds. fol. 20. b.
.

An other case there was also sometimes used and practiced, of devising lands,
tenements, and hereditamentes by wills to certain uses, intentes and trustes:
which wills or testamentes of lands, tenementes and hereditamentes in
feoffees hands were for the time accounted and taken for good Stat. H. 8. an.

.

But this custom was reformed in many things, for diverse good considerations:
namely, because by the common law of this realm, lands, tenements and
hereditaments, be not deuisable by testament: and also for that such devises
were not only hurtful to the heir of the testator, being many times
thereby disinherited, but also for that diverse other inconveniences did by
reason thereof ensue: as that the lords lost their wards, marriages, reliefes,
harriots, escheates, aids, Pur fair fitz chiualer and pur file marier.
Furthermore by occasions of such wills, and other conueiaunces, to secret
intentes, uses and trustes, men could not be certainly assured, of any
lands by them purchased, nor knew not against whom they should use their
actions and executions, for their rights and titles. Besides this men married
lost their tena^ces by the courtesy, women their dowries; finally the prince
himself lost the profits of the lands of persons attainted: For reformation
whereof a statute was made in the time of King Henry the eight, and enacted as
follows d. Stat. H. 8. an. 27. c. 10.

Provided always, that if any such woman be lawfully expulsed or euicted from

Certain cases wherein by the statutes of this realm, it is lawful to devise
lands, tenementes or hereditaments.
. iiij.
Now follow certain other cases authorized by the statuts of this realm of
England, wherein it is lawful to bequeath or devise lands, tenements and
hereditamentes by will; sometimes wholly, and sometimes in part only, or
rateably, according to the nature of the tenure of such lands, tenements and
hereditamentes, as in the same statuts, which I have here set down at large
does appear.

An Act, declaring how by the Kings grant lands, tenementes and
hereditamentes, may be by will, testament, or otherwise disposed, and
concerning wards and primer seasin, etc. Anno 32 II. 8. c. 1.

WHere the kings most royal majesty in all the time of his most gracious
and noble reign has ever been merciful, loving and beneuolent, and most
gracious sovereign lord unto all and singular his loving and obedient
subjects, and at many times past has not only showed and imparted to them
generally by his many and often great and beneficial pardons heretofore by
authority of his parleme^ts granted, but also by diverse other ways and means
many great and ample grants and benignities in such wise, as al his said
subjects bin most bounden to the uttermost of all their powers and graces by
them received of God, to render and give unto his majesty their most humble
reverence and obedient thanks and services, with their daily and continual
prayer to almighty God, for the continual preservation of his most royal
estate, in most kingly honor and prosperity: yet always his majesty being
repleat and endowed by God with grace, goodness, and liberality, most tenderly
considering that his said obedient and loving subjects can not use or exercise
themselves, according to their estats, degrees, faculties and qualities, or to
bear themselves in such wise, as that they may conveniently keep and
maintain their hospitalities and families, nor the good educations, and
bringing up of their lawful generations, which in this realm laud be to God,
is in all parts very great and abundant, but that in manner of necessity, as by
daily experience is manifested and known, they shall not be able of their
proper goods, cattelles, and other moveable substance to discharge their
debtes, and after their degrees set forth and advance their children and
posterities: Wherefore our said sovereign Lord most virtuously considering the
mortality that is to every person at Gods will and pleasure most common and
uncertain, of his most blessed disposition and liberality being willing to
relieve and help his said subjects in their said necessities and debility, is
contented and pleased that it be ordained, and enacted by authority of this
present parliament in manner and form as hereafter follows; that is to say,

to give, will, dispose and devise, as well by his last will or testament in
writing or otherwise, by any act or acts lawfully executed in his life, all

free will and pleasure, any law, statute, custom or other thing heretofore

Of the devise of goods and Chattelles.
1 All manner of goods and chattelles may be devised by will, certain cases
excepted.

2 The rule of the devise of lands contrary to the rule of disposing of goods.

. v.
COncerning the second kind of things deuiseable by testament, namely goods
and chattelles; this may be delivered for a rule: That all manner of goods and
chattelles, may be bequeathed or devised by will or testament L. caetera. ff.

.

Which rule is clean contrary to the former of the devise of lands,
tenementes, and hereditamentes; for they can not be devised, saving where some
custom, or statute has gained liberty, of bequeathing or devising of the
same Vt supr. ead. part.. 2, 3, 4.
: But here in steed of the Negative rule, is set down the Affirmative, the
exceptions of which rule are prosecuted in the next Paragraphe.

Diverse kinds of goods, not deuiseable by will.
1 Goods which a man has jointly with an other, can not be devised by will.

2 What if the other ioint-tenannt be made Executor whether is the bequest good?

3 Goods which a man has as administratour, cannot be given by will.

4 Every administrator accomptable to the ordinary.

5 Difference betwixt the executor, and the executor of an administrator.

6 Goods of the realm, that is to say, of the ancient crown and iewelles,
can not be given by will.

7 Goods belonging to a church or hospital, can not be devised.

8 Goods belonging to a city, boroughe or communaltie, can not be devised.

9 Church goods can not be devised.

10 Things which descend to the heir and not to the executor, are not
deuiseable by will.

11 Whether the corn growinge upon the ground, whereof a man is seized in
right of his wife, be deuiseable?

12 Whether corn on the ground be deuiseable by the lessee, the lessor being
seized in right of his wife.

13 Corn growing deuiseable by the tenant, by the courtesy of England.

14 Corn growing deuiseable by the tenant in dower.

15 Whether corn growing on land morgaged, be deuiseable?

16 Whether corn growing, may be devised by the testators daughter, where a
son and heir is afterward borne, or wherein the mother does recover her
dower?

17 The testator cannot bequeath that which is an other man's.

. vj.
FIrst a man can not give or bequeath by will any of those goods or catelles
which he has jointly with an other, for if he should bequeath his portion
thereof to a third person, this bequest is void by the laws of this realm
Perkins. tit. devise. fol. 101. Doct. and Stud. lib. 1. c. 6. licet ius civil
contrarium dictet. L. cum alienum. C. de legatis.
, and the suruiuor, which had those goods or cattelles jointly with an other,
shall have that portion so bequeathed notwithstanding the said will Hoc verum
iure regni nostri Angliae. Doct. and Stud. lib. 2. c. 25. secus iure civilly, vt
late per Olden. de action. class. 4. action. pro socio
. In so much that if the testator make the other iointenaunt his executor,
against the which executor, an action is commenced in the ecclesiastical
court in a cause of legacy: nevertheless the executor is not to be adjudged
to possess the said goods as executor, or by right of the will, but by the
title and right of the suruiuor Doct. and Stud. lib. 2. c. 25.
, and so the executor is to be dismissed, and the will in that respect to be
judged void Vide supr. ead. part.. 3. n. 8.
.

Secondly, an administrator can not make a testament of those goods which he
has as administrator, to any person dying intestate Brook tit. administrator.
n. 7. Fitzherb. eod. tit. n. 3.
, because he has not any such goods to his own proper use Plowd. in cas.
inter Bransby and Grantham. fol. 525. 526.
, but ought there withal to pay the debtes and legacies of the dead person,
and to distribute the rest, (if any thing do remain) in Godly and
charitable uses c ita quorundam. de testam. lib. 3. prouinci. constable. Cant.
stat. Ed. 3. an 31. c. 11.
, and for that cause, every administrator is accomptable to the ordinary for
such distribution of the goods of the deceased, committed to his administration
d. Stat. Ed. 3. an. 31. c. 11.
. And albeit an executor of an executor may administer the goods of the
former testator Stat. Ed. 3. an. 31. c. 25.
: yet the executor of an administrator can not administer the goods of the
former deceased, but a new administration is to be committed by the ordinary
of all the goods vnadministred, by the late administrator, as if he had also
died intestate; any testament or assignatio^ of an executor by him
notwithstanding Brook. Abridg. tit. administ. n. 7. Principal grounds. fol. 61.
. By this the^ it appears, that the authority of an executor is greater then
of an administrator: for an executor may appointe an executor to the first

away the goods of the testator in his will by legacies, no more then an
administrator Plowd. d. cas. inter Bransby and Grantham.
, for those goods are not the proper goods of the executor: but are to be
employed for the behoof of the testator c. stat. de testa. lib. 3. prouincial.

; and in that respect also is the executor accomptable to the ordinary as well
as th'administrator Eod. c. statutum.

special choice, to who^ nothing is bequeathed in the said testament.

Thirdly, by the opinion of diverse justices of this realm, and doctors of the
cannon and civil law, the goods of this realm, that is to say, of the
ancient crown, and iewelles, cannot be disposed by will Fitzherb. Abridg.

, as is aforesaid Supr. part. 2.. vlt.

Fourthlie those things, which belong to any college or hospital, can not
be devised by the testament or last will of the master of the said College
or Hospital Perkins. tit. deuise^ fol. 96. Doct. and Stud. lib. 2. c. 39.
. The same may be said of a Mayor of any city or borough, for he can not
by his testament, bequeath any thing belonging to the city, borough or
comminaltie Perkins. tit. devise. fol. 96.. non solum. Instit de lega. verse.

, no more then a master of a college or hospital, such things as he has in
right of the college or hospital Perkins. vbi supra.

Fiftlie, the goods of the church can not be devised by testament c. 1. de
testam. extr.
: But the corn growing upon the glebe Stat. H. 8. an. 28. c. 11
, and certain other goods may be bequeathed, as has been before declared
Supr. part. 2.. penul.
.

Sixtlie, those things which after the death of the testator, descend to the
heir of the deceased, and not to his executor, can not be devised by
testament Perkins. tit. devises. a quo sequentes casus mutuatus sum.
, except in such cases, where it is lawful to devise lands, tenementes, or
hereditaments. And therefore if a man seized of lands in fee or fee tail,
bequeath his trees growing upon the said land at the time of his death, this
devise is not good except as before: but if he devise the corn growing upon
the same land at the time of his death, from the heir to some other person,
this devise is good, albeit the land whereupon it grows be not deuiseable:
the reason of the difference is, because the trees are parcel of the
freehold, and descend together with the land to the heir and not to the
executor: but it is not so of corn, for the same shall go to the executor as
parcel of the testators goods. And therefore if a man be seized of lands in
the right of his wife, and sow the land, and devise the corn growing upon
the same land, and die before the corn be reaped: in this case the legatarie
shall have the corn and not the wife: but it is otherwise of grass, and
herbs not separated from the ground, at the time of the death of the
testator. If a man seized in fee in right of his wife do let the same land
for years to a stranger, and the lessee sows the ground, and afterward
the wife dies, the corn not being ripe: In this case the lessee may devise
the same corn, notwithstanding his estate be determined. So is it, if he that
is tenant by courtesy of England of lands, tenementes or hereditamentes for
his life, let the same land to an other for years, and the leassor die within
the term of those years: In this case the lessee may devise the corn which
shall be growing upon the same land, not ripe at the time of the death of the
testator. Likewise if the tenante in dower, sow those lands which he has in
dower, and make his executors, and after dies, the corn not separated, there
the executors shall have the corn, notwithstanding the same be not seeded, and
so the tenant in dower, may devise the corn, growing upon that land which she
holds in dower at the time of her death. But it is not always lawful for a
man or a woman to devise the corn by them sown, for if a man seized of land
in fee do infeoffee a stranger in morgage upon paimente, and not payment made
on the party of the feoffer, at a certain day: and the feofee sow the land,
and the feoffer pay the money at the day appointed, and enter: in this case
it is thought, that the feoffee cannot devise the corn growing upon the said
land. Likewise if he that is tenaunte in tail of certain land, do let the
same land for term of life, and the lessee do sow the same land, and the
tenaunte in tail die, and the issue do recover the same in form don in the
descent before the corn be separated: it is thought in this case that the issue
in tail may bequeath the same by his testament. Moreover if a man seized in
fee, have issue a daughter and die, his wife being great with child, and the
daughter enter and sow the ground, and afterward before the corn be severed,
the wife is delivered of a son, and thereupon his next friend do enter for him;
yet the daughter may devise the corn growing upon the same land: but if after
the sowing of the corn and before the birth of the son, the mother has
recovered her dower against her daughter, and the same land that is sown, is
allotted or assigned unto her by the Sheriff, for her dower, in allowance of
other lands, there the mother may devise the corn, growing upon the said
land, and not her daughter.

Finally, whereas by the civil law, it was lawful for the testator to
bequeath not only his own things, but an other man's also. No^ solum Instit.

thereof d.. non solum. L. si vnum.. si rem. ff. de lega. 2.

only that which is his own, and that which he has to his proper use Plowd.

executor is neither bound to redeem the thing for the legatarie, nor to pay
the value thereof Couar. Panor. Sichard. vbi supra.

whether the thing bequeathed were his own, or an other man's Si enim ignorasset

making of the testamente is not his, but the testator afterward does buy the
same: Whether is this thing due or recouerable by the legatarie yea, or naie?
By the civil law it is not due L. 1. ff. de regul. Cato^.
, but in some few cases Repertor. Bertachni. verb. regula. Caton.
. By the laws of this realm it seems that we are to distinguish, whether
some special thing be devised or not; for if a special or certain thing be
devised, as if the testator do bequeath the manor of Dale, then albeit the
testator had no such manor when the will was made: yet by the purchase made
afterward, the testator is presumed to have had this meaning from the
beginning, to purchase the same for the benefit of the legatarie, and so the
devise is good Plowd. in cas. inter Bret and Rygden. fol. 344
. But if the legacy be not special but general, as if the testator do
bequeath all his lands, then the testator having some lands at the time of
making the testament, and purchasing other lands afterward, these lands
purchased after the making of the testament shall not pass Plowd. vbi supra.
. But howsoever the laws of this realm have determined concerning the devise
of lands, tenements and hereditaments, purchased after the making of the
testament: yet concerning goods, if the testator do bequeath any such thing
in general terms, as a horse or an ox, although the testator have neither
horse nor ox at the time of his testament made, neither yet at the time of his
death, the legacy is not therefore void Bar. Paul. de Castr. and al^j. in L.
legate. generaliter. de leg. 1. ff.

confirmed, where also is showed to whom the choice belongs in this case, and

Of Assigning tutors, and disposinge of childrens portions, during their
minorities generally considered.
1 Many questions about the tuition of children.

2 The matter of tuitions both large and uncertain.

. vij.
IF I should undertake to speak fully of the assignement, or appointinge of
tutors to children, and custody of their portions or other rightes during
their nonage, not only many questions would offer themselves to be handled,
(namely who may grant the tuition, of whom, to whom, after what manner, what
is the office and authority of a tutor, when the tuition is finished, what
action the pupil has against the tutor for the recovery of his rightes, or
the tutor against the pupil for the charge of his education and conservation
of such things as are due to the child; and finally if the tutor
testamentarie excuse him self, or refuse the tutorship, what order is to be
taken in the behalf of the child,) which questions are so ample and minister
so great abundance of matter, that it is not possible to comprehend the same
within any compass fit for this brief treatise. And further the customs
of this realm are so diverse and contrary one to an other, which do concern
this matter, that I might easily fall into diverse errors.

Wherefore as well for that this matter should not exceed the proportion of a
just member, as also for that I would be loath to play the blind guide, I
thought it better, and more safe, to refer the Reader to the learned of every
place, of whom he may be more sufficiently certified of their particular
customs, then to fill up this volume with the multitude of different; yea and
contrary observations, of sundry countries, and places within this Realm,
whereof I can obtain no sounder warrant nor better assurance of the legalitie
thereof, then the bare reports, and relations of others.

Howbeit, forasmuch as within the Province of York, I my self have had some
reasonable experience in these affairs for many years, I thought it not
amiss briefly to signify what is there observed.

Of the committing of the tuition of children, and custody of their portions,
within the province of York.
1 No parents of any Country have like power over their children, as had the
Romans.

2 Whence the authority of assigning children, did descend.

3 The customs of the North parts of this Realm, do very much resemble the
Civil law.

. viii.
ALbeit neither within this Realm of England, nor within any realm christian,
any parents have the like power over their children, as had the Romans. Ius
aute^. Instit. de tutelis. and ibi glossa in qua enumera^tur septe^ aut octo in
quibus ius patriae potestatis consistit.
; to who^ alone that patria potestas was proper and particular Eod.. nec non
tract. de repub. Angl lib. 3. c. 7. Intellige tamen vt in gloss. in d.. ius
aute^.
; which was the chief cause whereby they did and might by their testamentes,
commit the bodies of their children, and their portions at their pleasures to
the custody of others according to the civil law L. 1. ff. de testa. tutel..
permissum. Instit. de tutel.
: yet in diverse places within this realm, and namely throughout the province
of York, there does remain a certain resemblance of that power and
determination of the civil law; as in many other things, so also in the
assigning or appointinge of tutors by their testaments or last wills Vt patet ex
his quae subsequuntur. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
, whether we regard the person of the testator or of him that is assigned
tutor, or of the children, or the manner of assignation, or the office and
authority of the tutor, or the means whereby the tuition is ended, which I
must only point at.

Who may appoint a Tutor.
1 The father may appoint a tutor, by his testamente or last will.

2 Whether the mother may appoint a tutor.

3 Whether a stranger may assign a tutor.

4 Whether the ordinary may assign a tutor.

. ix.
Understand therefore that by general custom observed within the province of
York De qua consuetudine apertissime, per indubitatae fidei acta and
instrumenta antiqua, in archiuis Archiepiscopi E^o^ac. reposita, constat.
, the father by his last will or testament may for a time commit the tuition
of his child, and the custody of his portion Fat^or quidem nostratium liberos
ab illa prima potestate fere solutos, and quasi emancip^tos esse, vt refert D.
Smith in suo tract. de repub. Angl. Qu^^ tamen haec consuetudo, quae vel
praecipue in partibus borealibus viget, summa nitatur aequitate and ratione,
negari non potest. Quis enim diligentius de pupilli rebus cogitat quam
parents? aut cui maiori curae esse poterit, vt ex eo maxim quantums nulla
alia subesset causa, ijs liceret morientibus, in testamentis suis designare
liberis vice parents cos, quorum experta fide norunt futuros esse liberis suis
tutores, id est, tu^ores, sieve defensores.
, for within that province, children have their filial portions of their
fathers goods according to the civil law Et quidem debetur eadem prorsus
quantitas, nam vt quandoque triens, quandoque semis competit. (auth. nouissimo
C. de inoffic. testo^) pro numero liberorum, ita iure quo nos vtimur, media

If the father die, no tutor being by him assigned, and the mother do in her
last will and testament appointe a tutor, the same will is to be proved, and
the assignation of the tutor confirmed Confirmatur quide tutor a matre datus,

And if no tutor be assigned by either of the parents, then may a stranger if
he make the Orphane his executor, and give him his goods, assign a tutor unto
him L. patronus. ff. de consir. tit. nam qui instituit impuberem videtureum

And if there be no tutor testamentarie at all, then may the ordinary commit
the tuition of the child to his next kinse-man De hac potestate testimonium

antiqua, quae in archiuis publicis Archiepiscopi Ebor. fideliter custodita.

the custody of his person, as is hereafter declared Infr. ead. part.. xj.

Who may be appointed Tutor.
1 He that cannot be executor cannot be tutor.

2 Whether he that is under age or lunatike may be appointed tutor.

3 Whether a woman may be tutrix.

Any person may be assigned tutor which is not forbidden Quando excipiuntur

be assigned tutor: but it is to be understood that he shall be tutor when he
is of full age, or when he does return to sanitie of mind furiosus. Instit.

.

By the civil law a woman (the mother and grandmother excepted) can not be
assigned tutrix L. iure nostro de testa. tuit. ff.
: but it is not observed as a law within the province of York, where not
only the mother and grandmother are admitted, but other women also, albeit
they be married, and under the government of their husbands Vt per acta and
instrume^ta. d. scacarij Archiepiscopi Ebor.
.

To whom a tutor may be appointed.
1 A tutor may be assigned to him that is not 14. years old, and to her that
has not accomplished twelve.

2 After 14. and 12. he and she may choose their curators.

3 When the curator is to be confirmed.

4 A tutor may be assigned to the child unborn.

5 No tutor can be assigned unto him that is ward by reason of his lands.

6 Neither to infants or idiots wards.

7 Who shall have the ward-ship of a child that has lands.

8 What the Guardian may do.

9 The hard estate of wards.

10 All infantes wards, are not subject to like conditions.

11 Who shall be Guardian to the infant, which has lands in socage.

12 Procheyn amie accomptable to the ward after his full age.

13 Idiots in the custody of the prince, whether the custody of an infant or
ideote may be devised by the testator.

. xj.
BY the said custom generally observed within the province of York, a Tutor
may be assigned to a boie at any time until he have accomplished the age of
14. years, and to a wench until she have accomplished the age of twelve years
L. tutelae. C. de testa. tut.. permissum. Instit. de tutel. tit. quibus modis

was made L. tutelae. C. de testa. tut.. dantur. Instit. de cura.

infant does hold his lands, so soon as the father dies, has the wardship

of the marriage Stat. West. c. 22.
, which is commonly rated accordingly to the profits of his lands, which is
a thing utterly condemned of some and greatly lamented of many, both grave
and godly; because of the insatiable covetousness of diverse in these days
Vide d. tract. de repub. Angl. lib. 3. c. 5. Terms of law. verb. gardein.
, for that thereby it comes to pass many times, that a free man and a
gentleman whiles he is an infant, of slender discretion and less experience,
destitute of his best friend, that is to say, his natural father, and
consequently subject to the subtilties and importunities of his crafty and
covetous Gailor, is bought and sold like a beast, to such as seek to make
most advantage of him; and in the end besides many more inconueniaunces,
matched to my masters daughter, sister, cousin, or some other female, to whom
for her virtues and gentle conditions, if thine enemy should be preferred in
marriage, thou could wish him no greater torment (if it were lawful forthee
to wish him any torment) hell excepted.

To these perils are these infants subject which hold lands of other by
knights service, called in french Guard noble d. tract. eod. c. 5.

wardship does belong Quia tutorem habe^ti tutor non datur.

7 What if the testator say, I commit my children to thy power or to thy
hands.

8 What if he say, I commit my children unto the quick and dead.

9 What if he say, I desire thee to take care of my son.

10 The testator may use any language in the assignation of a tutor.

If the testator say, I desire my wife to take care of my children, during

The same also may be said where the testator does commit his child to the

a child, then to have the bare custody of a child committed unto him Romans

Of the office and authority of a Tutor.
1 The office of a tutor does principally respect the person of the pupil.

2 The office of a tutor does secondarilie respect the good administration of
the pupilles goods.

3 The tutor ought to make an inuentarie and is chargeable with an account.

4 Whether a tutor ought to enter into bonds for the performaunce of his
office.

5 Of the authority of a tutor.

6 Whether the tutor may alienate the goods of the pupil.

THe office and authority of the Gardyan or him that has the wardship of any
infant, by reason of any lands, tenements or hereditame^ts, whether the same
be holde^ by knights service, or by soccage tenure is already declared Supra

, wherefore in this place I shall only touch the office and authority of a
tutor, according to the custom observed within the province of York, not
greatly differing from the disposition of the civil law.

This therefore is the office of a tutor. First and principally to defend the
person of his pupil Inde rutores quasi tuitotes, id est, defensores, a tuendo,
and defendendo appellantur, sicut aeditui dicuntur, qui aedes tuentur..

Secondarilie, the office of a tutor consists in the good and faithful
administering, or disposing of the goods and cattelles of the said pupil.

, that is to say, the tutor may not commit any thing that may be
hurtful, nor omit any that may be profitable to his pupil Latius de offic.

By what means the tutorship is ended.
1 The tutor-ship is ended by diverse means.

3 Sufficient age in a man at 21. sometimes at 14.

4 Sufficient age in a woman, at 12. 14. 16. years in diverse respects.

5 In respect of the tutor his office is ended, if he cannot be executor or do
excuse himself.

6 Likewise if he be removed as suspected, or become lunatike or deaf and
dumb, or be absent or die.

7 How the tutorship is ended in respect of the form of the tuition.

Of the quantity of lands deuiseable by will.
1 Of lands, tenementes, and hereditamentes, sometimes all, sometimes but two
parts of three, is deuiseable.

. xv.
Now that I have showed what kind of things may be devised by will, it
remains to show how much is deuiseable, of lands or goods.

And first concerning lands, tenements and hereditamentes, sometimes they may
be devised wholly, as lands, tenementes and hereditamentes holden in socage,
or of the nature of socage tenure Sup^. ead. part.. 4.
: sometimes two parts of three may be devised, namely of lands, tenements
and hereditaments holden in cheef by knights service, or of the nature of
knights service in chief Eod. 4.
, as appears more fully heretofore, where I have set down the statutes at
large.

What quantity of goods or chattels may be devised by testament.
1 Legacies to be paid out of the clear debtlesse goods.

2 The executor compellable to pay dettes out of his own purse, if he pay
legacies first.

3 Funeral expenses to be deducted out of the whole goods.

4 The testator may sometime bequeath all his detlesse goods, sometimes
half, and sometimes but a third part.

5 When half the testators goods is due to the wife or children.

6 When the wife and children ought to have either of them a third part.

7 Whether the wife and children ought to have any part of the dettes due to
the testator.

8 Whether the wife and children may claim any reasonable part of leases.

9 Whether the wife and children may claim a reasonable part of goods, where
there is no custom.

10 The reason of the law which leaves all to the disposing of the testator.

11 The reason of the custom whereby the power of the testator is restrained.

. xvj.
COncerning the quantity of goods and chattelles to be disposed, this is first
to be noted, that the testator can not bequeath any part of the goods, but
where something remains clear, the moderate funerals, and the debtes due by
the testator first discharged Bracton de legib and co^s. Angl. lib. 2. c. 26.
n. 2 L. scimus.. and si praesatam. C. de iure de lib. In qua lege assignatur
ratio quare legatarijs praeferuntur creditores: ne^pe legatarij de lucro

nostro, cautum est, quo non legatarios, sed ipsum executorem conuenire
permittitur, vt statim subijcitur.
. And therefore if the testator do bequeath any legacies by his testament
where his goods and chattelles will not suffice to discharge his funeralles
and debts, and the executor pay any of those legacies, before he have
discharged the debts, by means whereof there is not sufficient goods left
wherewith to pay the testators debtes: in this case the executor shall be
charged with the payment thereof out of his own purse Fitzherb. Abridg. tit.

vbi principi quid sit debitum, quia regia debita suo periculo scire debet.
Brook. tit. exec. n. 116.
.

This then being understood that no legacy is due, but where there cleerlie
remain some goods and cattelles, the funeralles and debtes first deducted
(for funeral expe^ces are to be deducted forth of the whole goods both by the
civil law L. scimus.. in computatione C. de iure delib.
, and by the laws of this realm Fitzh. Na. Br. fol. 121 Doct. and Stud. lib.
2. c. 10. Brook Abridg. tit. exec. n 172.
.) Thou shall understand that of that which remains, sometimes the whole,
sometimes the half, and sometimes the third part, may be bequeathed or
devised by the testator, according to the diversity of these cases following.

The first case is, when the testator has neither wife nor child, at the time
of his death, for then he may dispose all the residue of his clear goods
and cattels at his pleasure Lindw. in c. statut. de testam. lib. 3. prouincial.
constit. Cant. verb. defunctum. Bracton. de legib. and consuetu. Ang. lib. 2.
c. 26. Tract. de repub Angl. lib. 3. c 6. Fitzherb. Bre. de rationabil. part
bon.
.

The second case is, when the testator at the time of his death has a wife and
no child, or else some child or children, but no wife. In which case by a
custom observed, not only throughout the province of York, but in many
other places besides, within this realm of England; the goods are to be
divided into two parts, and the testator can not bequeath any more then his
part, that is to say, the one half, for the other half is due to the wife, or
else to the children, by virtue of the said custom Lindw. Bracton. and
Fitzherb. vbi supr.
.

The third case is, where the testator leaves behind him both a wife, and
also a child or children: In which case by the custom observed in diverse
places of this realm of England, and namely within the province of York: the
testator can not bequeath any more of his goods, then the third part of the
clear goods Act. and computat. in scaccario Archiepiscopi Ebor. Lindw. Bract.
and Fitzher. vbi supr.
, for in this case the said clear goods are to be divided into three parts,
whereof the wife ought to have one part, the child or children an other part,
and the third part (which is called the deaths part) remains, to the
testator, by him to be given or bequeathed to who^ he thinks good Lind.
Bract. and Fitzh. in locis praed.
.

And here note that where the wife or children ought to have a ratable part of
the goods of the deceased, be it a third part or half as the case yields,
there also they ought to have a like part of the debtes due unto the testator
after they be recovered by the executor or administrator, for then they are
numbered or accounted amongst the goods of the testator but not before Brook
Abridg. tit. exec. n. 112. Siquidem si ista ex co^suetudiue tantum debentur,
hac non prob^ta, sine difficultate illud procedet quod est iuri recepto magis
consonum.
. But of leases the wife and children can not have any ratable part within
the province of York, or other places, where they have been accustomed to
have their ratable part of the moveable goods and debtes recovered, unless
the said wife or children demanding their ratable parts of leases, do prove
that by special custom of that place, (namely of that city, county,
deanrie or parish where the testator dwelled and had such leases,) the wives
and children were accustomed to have their ratable part, as well of the
leases, as of the mooueable goods of the testator, which special custom
being proved, they may recover their ratable part as before Fitzh. in Br. de
rationab. part. in quo Breui fit mentio, non solum bonorum, sed etiam.
cattallorum. Atque huc facit, quod habemus in Mag. Chart. c. 18.
.

The fourth case is, when there is no such custom, of dividing the goods of
the testator into two parts, or into three parts, as is before mentioned, in
which case albeit some were of this opinion, that even by the common laws of
this realm, the clear mooue-able goods were to be divided into three parts
or into two parts as before, whereof the wife and children were to have their
parts In hac sententia stetit Glandeuile, antiquus huius regni iurisconsultus,
motus per stat. de Magna. Chart. c. 18. vt refert Fitzh. in d. Breui de
rationab. part. bon. Brook Et per de rationab part: bo: sic enim post multa^
disputationem inquit. Et fuit dit pue. ley M. 31. Henr. 8. que ceo ad estre
mise en ure come un com^en ley and nunque demurr, and ideo videtur que ceo est
le com^en ley.
, and consequently that the testator could not dispose any more thereof, then
the half or third, being the deaths part. Nevertheless others (whose opinion
has prevailed) do hold the contrary, to wit that there is no such division
to be made by force of the common laws of this land, but only by force of
custom Fitzh. d. Br. de rationab. part. bonor. Brac. de legib. and co^suet.
Ang. lib. 2. 26. Tract. de repub. Angl. lib. 3. c. 6.
, and co^sequentlie that it is lawful for the testator, by the laws of this
realm (except in those places where the custom aforesaid is observed) to
dispose all the whole residue of his goods, his funeralles and debtes
deducted) at his likinge, and that the wife or child can claim no more
thereof, but according as the testator shall devise by his testament.

And in the opinion of some, the law of this land which leaves all the
residue to the disposition of the testator, funeralles and debts deducted,
seems to have better ground in reason, then the custom, whereby he is
forced either to leave two parts of three, or at least the one half to his
wife and children Bracton. d. lib. 2. c. 26
. For what if the son be an unthrift, or naughty person, what if the wife
be not only a sharp shrowe, but perhaps of worse conditions? Is it not hard
that the testator must leave either the one half of his goods to that wife or
child or more, for the which also peradventure he had labored full sore all
his life? were it not more reason that it should be in the liberty of the
father, or husband to dispose thereof at his own pleasure? which when the wife
and children understood, it might be a means whereby they might become more
obedient, live more virtuously, and contend with good desert, to win the
good will and favor of the testator Hisce rationibus vtitur Bracton in
desensionem ^u^ is huius regni. d c. 26. cui add Rebuff. in L obuenire de
verb. signif. ff. fol. 682.
. These reasons make for the testator, and for the equity of the common law,
which leaves the whole residue to his disposition.

But the custom whereby the liberty of the testator is restrained is not
without reason also. Forwhere it is asked, what if the child be an unthrift,
the wife worse then a shrowe? So it may be demanded with like facility, what
if the child be no unthrift, but frugall and virtuous? what if the wife be an
honest and modest woman? which thing is the rather to be presumed c. dudum.
etc. vltim. de praesump. extr. Mas. card. tract. de probae. conclus. 222.
. But if it be not amiss to fear the worst, then on the contrary, what if
the testator be an unnatural father or unkind husband? perhaps also greatly
enriched by his wife, whereas before he was but poor, stands it not with as
great reason that such a wife and children should be provided for, and that it
should not be in the power of such a testator, to give all from them, or to
bestow it upon such as had not so well deserved it, and by that means set his
wife and children a begging? surely the custom has as good ground in reason
against lewd husbands and unkind fathers, as has the law in meeting with
disobedient wives and unthrifty children Mediam viam elegit Iustinianus, tam
quoad vxorem, quam quoad liberos. Nam quod ad vxorem attinet, inbet imperator

If the testator do bequeath more then he may, which legacy is to be
preferred or what other course is to be followed.
1 If the testator bequeath more then the deaths part, whether one legacy is
to be preferred before an other?

2 Diverse opinions about this question.

3 First concerning this question we are to consider, whether there be an
inuentarie or not.

4 An inuentarie being made the legatarie need not pay any one whole
legacy, where there is not sufficient to pay the rest.

5 Certain cases wherein an inuentarie being made, the executor is forced to
discharge some legacies wholly, though there be not sufficient goods wherewith
to discharge the rest.

6 If the executor pay to some legatarie his whole legacy, whether he thereby
tie himself to pay the rest wholly also.

7 Whether the legacy being vnduelie paid, may be recovered.

8 No inuentarie being made, how far the executor is bound to pay legacies.

. xvij.
Now that we have seen when the testator may dispose all the residue of his
clear goods or half, or but the third part only: and what be the reasons
of enlarging or restraining of the liberty of the testator in that behalf,
for as much as it does often fall out in fact, that the testator does
bequeath more by his testament, then he may by law or custom, that is to
say, more then the whole residue where he may dispose all, or more then the
half, where he can give but the half, or more then the third, where he can
give no more but the third. It shall not be unprofitable to examine which of
the legacies are first to be discharged, and namely whether that legatarie
which is first named in the will, ought to have his legacy first answered
before the rest, and that he that is named in the second place to have his
legacy next, and so the third and fourth, until the deaths part be wholly
spent, and then the rest of the legataries to have nothing: or whether the
executor may gratify which of the legataries he will, without difference
whether he be first or last named in the will, or else whether ought every
legatarie to suffer defalcatio^, or ratable deduction from every legacy, to
wit, from the greater legacy the greater part, and from the lesser legacy the
lesser part, proporcionably, so that the legacies do not exceed the deaths
part, and that the deaths part may suffice to pay the legacies.

It seems by the opinion of some, that a ratable part is to be deducted, and
taken from every legacy, and that it is not in the power of the executor to
gratify any one legatarie to the prejudice of an other legatarie, whether he
be first or last in the testament L. si quis testamento apud Iulianum. ff. de
leg. 1. and Ias. ibid. Paul. de castr. in L. scimus.. legitimam creditorib. C.
de iure delib.
, but rather, if the executor pay to one legatarie his whole legacy, that
then he binds himself to pay to the rest of the legataries their whole
legacies also In Auth. de haered. and falcid.. non autem. and ibi Bar.
.

On the contrary it seems by the opinion of others, that if the executor do
make an inventory, then it is in the power and choice of the executor, to pay
to which of the legataries he will, his whole legacy L. scimus.. and si
praefatam. C. de iure delib. and ibi Ias. verb. tertia vtilitas. Plowd. in cas.

, and that payment being made accordingly, and no assettes remaning in the
hand of the executor, the legatarie has no more remedy against the executor
for his legacy, then has the creditor for his debt, who by the laws of this
realm is utterly excluded, and by which laws it is lawful for the executor,
to gratify which of the creditors he will Do. and Stu. lib. 2. c. 10.
, saving in certain cases else where mentioned Infr. part. 6.. 16.
.

In which contrariety of opinions this is first to be considered: whether the
executor do make an inventory or not.

If the executor do make an inventory, according to the laws and statuts of
this realm, then he need not pay to any legatarie his whole legacy Paul de
Castr. in L. scimus.. Im^a. creditoribus. C. de iure delib. Alex. in d. L.. and

, though he be first named in the will Ias. in L. si quis testa.. apud Iul. ff.

quantity Ias. post Paul de Castr. in d. L. si quis testo.. apud Iul. qua^uis

, for those legacies also are not to be diminished by reason of other general
legacies, or legacies consisting in quantity, the which shall remain wholly
unsatisfied, rather then those foresaid legacies shall be diminished: and
consequently in these cases it is not in the power of the executor, to
gratify any other legatarie at his election Paul. de Castr. in d.. apud Iul.
cuius consilio haec sunt menti tenenda, quia (inquit) sunt singularia.
.

Furthermore if the executor do make an inventory, and afterward pay to
some legatarie his whole entire legacy, yet is he not thereby tied, to pay the
rest of the legacies wholly, (the deaths part not being sufficient) and this
is undoubtedly true, if the executor were ignorant of other legacies given by
the testator Plowden in cas. inter Paramor and Yardley. Quod vero Bar. scripsit
quod haeres subtiliter seu scienter vni legatario integraliter solue^s, omnibus
alijs in solidum soluere compellitur, omni penitus inco^stantia amota,
intelligendum est, sine deductione salcidiae, id est, quartae haeredi debitae.
(Bar. in. non autem. de haered. and falcid. in Auth.) Nec enim dixit, neque
profecto somniauit Bartolus haeredem compellendum soluere reliqua legata sine

. But neither the executor nor any other legatarie, can reclaim or recover
that overplus paid and delivered to the hands of the legatarie, as vnduelie
paid unto him, in respect that there is not sufficient to pay all the rest of
the legacies out of the deaths part Hoc verum iure quo nos vtimur, quo neque

IN WHAT MANNER TESTAMENTES OR LAST WILLS ARE to be made. The fourth part.
Of the forms of testaments.
1 So many several forms of testamentes as there be kinds.

2 Of testamentarie forms some be general, some particular.

3 The general form of testamentes is twofold essential and accidental.

Here follows the fourth principal part of this testame^tary treatise:
wherein I undertook to show how or in what manner testamentes or last wills
may or ought to be made.

For performaunce whereof I thought it convenient, first to deliver certain
aduertiseme^ts, and then to proceed.

The first advertisement is this, that as there Supr. 1. part.. 7, 8, 9, etc.
) so there be diverse forms of testamentes or last wills: for every kind
has his several form, and every kind differs from an other by his form
L Iulianus. si quis. ad exhibend. ff.
.

The next advertisement is this, that albeit Supr. 1. part.. 7; 8. etc. and
infr. ead. par.. 22. cum reliq. vsque ad finem
; nevertheless they have also general forms common to them all Vt infr.
eod.. and. p^ox.
.

Wherefore before I speak of those particular forms, order requires that I
speak of the general.

Of which general forms some do respect substance or inward essence of the
testamente, whereby that is made to be, which was not Bar. and Ias. in L. nemo
ff de leg. 1.
, and some do respect the outward appeeraunce or proof of the testament,
whereby that is made to appear, which otherwise though it were should not seem
to be Olden. de actio^. class. 5. in prin. vbi tenet contra Bar. and alios,

Of the general substantial form of every Testament.
1 The essential form common to every testament, is the naming of an
executor.

2 What it is to appoint an executor.

3 The naming of an executor is said to be the head of the testament.

4 The naming of an executor is also said to be the foundation of the
testament.

5 No will properly termed a testament, wherein no executor is named, albeit
other legacies be left therein.

6 The effect of dying without or with an executor.

7 An occasion of further consideration concerning the making of an executor.

testator, who may enter to the testators goods and cattels, and who has

Seeing therefore, the force and efficacy of making of an executor is such, as
without the which no will or disposition is, or deserves to be termed, a
testament, and without the which the party deceased shall be deemed to have
died intestate, notwithstanding the multitude of other legacies or devises,
and so administration of the goods to be committed as is aforesaid: It shall be
therefore behooful to step a little further into the consideration of this
matter, of making an executor, as the most excellent part and foundation of
every testament, and to show after how many sorts an executor may be
made Infr.. prox.

appointing an executor Infr. ead. part.. 4.

After how many sorts an Executor may be made.
1 An executor may be appointed simply or conditionally, from or until a
time, directly or indirectlie, universally or particularly, in the first
degree, second, third, etc. and one alone may be appointed executor or many.

reader to observe, that as an executor may be made diversely,

Of a pure or simple assignation of an Executor.
1 The chief points considerable about the simple assignation of an executor.

2 What is a pure or simple assignation of an executor.

3 Diverse examples of a simple appointment of an executor.

4 Whether is he understood to be made executor to who^ the testator does
give all, or the residue of his goods.

5 It is not always needful to express this word executor, in making of an
executor, namely when the testators meaning is known.

6 Other examples of the former conclusion.

7 The general legatarie is not always understood to be executor.

8 What if the words be indifferent either to make a testament or a codicill.

9 An executor may be made either by the proper motion of the testator, or at
the interrogation of an other.

10 The testator must have a firm purpose of making his testament, otherwise
words are of no force.

11 It skilleth not of words, so that the meaning appear, neither in what
part of the testament, the executor be appointed.

12 Of the effect of a pure or simple nomination of an executor.

13 Certain cases wherein the mention of a condition does not make
disposition conditional.

14 Whether impossible or dishonest conditions do make the disposition
conditional.

15 Whether necessary conditions make the disposition conditional.

16 Conditions referred to that which is paste or present are not properly
conditions.

17 Conditions necessarily understood do not make the disposition
condicionall.

18 The application of that which has been spoken of the assignation of an
executor to a legacy or devise.

19 Certain cases of the devise of lands wherein the meaning of the deuisour
is preferred before the propriety of words.

20 The different effects of a simple assignation of an executor and a simple
legacy.

21 A legatarie may not of his own authority take his legacy, and what is
the reason.

22 What remedy a legatarie has for the obtaining of his legacy.

23 Certain cases wherein the legtarie may of his own authority apprehend his
legacy.

COncerning the pure and simple what it is, in what form of words it may be
made, what is the effect thereof, and finally how a simple nomination of an
executor, and a simple legacy or devise do agree or differ.

means also, to be the meaning of the testator not to die intestate, but that
he to who^ all or the residue is bequeathed, should immediately by virtue of
the will, enter to all the Quo c^^^, nihil reor interesse, n^^e testametum

of an executor c. cum tibi de testa. extr. Brook. tit. exec. n. 98.

I make A.B. my executor Paul. Castrens. and alij in L. errore. C. de testa.
Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 4. tit. 3. n. 5.

if C.D. will not: In this case C.D. is presumed to be appointed executor: and
may if he will be admitted to the executor-ship, and exclude the other
executor Iul. Clar.. testm^. q. 35 n. 2.

dead, do say in his will; for as much as my child, brother, or kinse-man is
dead, I make A.B. my executor: in this case if the child or other person whom
the testator supposed to be dead, be alive: he that is named executor shall
not be admitted to the executorship, but the child, brother or kinse-man, whom
the testator thought to have been dead Sichard. in Rub. de haered. Insti. C. n.

made that child, brother or kinse-man, his executor, if he had thought him to
have been living, and not the party named Sichard. vbi supr. per L. fim^r.

make A. B. his executor, do answer yea, or I do, or what else, or why not,
or whom else should I make executor, or I cannot deny; this is a pure and a

, for otherwise if the testator have no meaning to make his will, although he
used the most plain words that might be devised, for the making of an
executor, yet (as I said ere while) it were no more a testamente or a will,
then a painted lion is a lion Supr. part. 1.. 3. n. 25
, for the purpose and meaning of the testator is the life and soul (as I may
term it) of the testamente, without the which the testators words are but

will L. diuus L. Lucius. ff. de mil. testa. plane. Instit. de mil. testa.

, for what if the testator say in ieaste, I make thee my executor? what if he
said so for fear? what if he were overcome with drink? therefore it is not
enough to prove the testators words, unless it be proved that the testator
had animum testandi: which how it is proved, is else where declared Infr. 1.

: whereas on the contrary, the effect of a conditional assignation, does
suspend his admission and execution of the testament, as afterward more fully
does appear Infr. ead. part.. 6. 7.

And there note that if the testator say, I make A. my executor according to
the conditions afterward expressed, if the testator afterward express no
conditions, it is in effect as if the testator had made him his executor
simply L. pen. C. de Instit. and sub.
. And so he may enter upon the testators goods presently after his death,
for the testator in not expressing any conditions, is presumed to have altered
and revoked his purpose concerning the adding of conditions DD. in d. L. Pe^.
, and consequently that he would have the appointment of the executor to be
pure and simple: howbeit if the testator making his executor upon conditions,
to be then expressed afterward, in the mean time, whiles he is in making his
will, be suddenly prevented by death, or insanitie of mind, that he can not
express those conditions, according to his purpose and determination: In this
case the assignation is void, and he which is so appointed executor is not to
be admitted to the executorship L. si quis destinauerat. alias, si is qui. ff.

being expressed, he that is so appointed ought not to be admitted Dec. and

: unless the time when the condition will be extant, be uncertain, as I make
A.B. my executor if my son shall die, for though it be most certain that he
will die: yet nothing is more uncertain then the time when, and therefore the
assignation is in effect conditional Sichard. in Rub. de condic. Instit. C.

And the like may be said, when the condition L. si ita stipulatus. ff. de

. And although the testator be uncertain whether the executor be bachelar of
law, or have been student, yet it is certain in respect of the fact it
self: and is either true or false at that instant when it is made, and so the
condition works no delaie or suspension, but is either a good or void

Finally that assignation of an executor is L. haec verba de leg. 1. ff. L.

.

That which has been spoken of the making mutatis mutandis: wherefore as that
nomination or assignation of an executor is pure and simple which is made
without condition, so that legacy is pure and sure which is given without
condition.

Secondly, by the like application it may appear, that it is not material
in what form of words a legacy be bequeathed, so that the testators meaning
do appear: which meaning is to be preferred before the propriety of words.
nostra. Instit. de lega.
, and that not only concerning goods and cattelles, but also concerning
lands and tenementes, for further declaration whereof I have added these
examples following which I have borrowed out of a little book called the
terms of law Verb. devise.
.

First therefore if a man do by his will devise to A.B. all his lands and
tenementes: In this case not only all his lands and tenementes, which the
testator has in possession do pass, but those also which he has in
reuersion by virtue of this word tenements.

Item if lands be devised to a man to have to him for evermore, or to have to
him, and his assigns: in these two cases the devise shall have a fee-simple,
whereas if it be given by feoffeme^t in such terms, the feoffee has but an
estate for his life, for a devise made without express words of heirs is
good even in fee-simple.

Item if a man devise his land to an other to give or sell, or do therewith
at his pleasure, and will this in fee-simple.

Item a devise made to one and to his heirs, males, does make an estate in
tail, but if such words be put in deed of feoffement it shall be taken in
fee-simple, because it does not appear of what body the heirs males shall
be begotten.

Item if lands be given by deed to A.B. and to the heirs males of his body,
who has issue a daughter, which daughter has issue a son, and dies, there
the land shall return to the donor, and the son of the daughter shall not
have it: because he cannot conueighe himself by heirs males, or his mother is
a let thereunto. But otherwise it is of such a devise given by will, for there
the son of the daughter shall have it, rather then the will shall be void.

Item if one devise to an infant in his mothers womb it is a good devise,
though such a feoffement, grant or gift be void.

Item if one will that his son shall have his land after the death of his
wife, here the wife of the deuisour shall have the land first, for term of
her life. So likewise if a man devise his goods to his wife, and that after
the decease of his wife, his son and heir shall have the house where the
goods are, there the son shall not have the house during the life of the wife:
for it is presumed that his intent was, that his wife should have the house
also for term of her life, notwithstanding it were not devised unto her by
express words.

Item if a devise of land be made to A.B. and to his heirs males of his body
begotten. After the devise has issue a son and a daughter, and dies, here
the daughter shall have the land, and not the son; howsoever he be the more
worthy person, and heir to his father, but because the will of the dead
person is that the daughter shall have it: therefore law and equity would
that it should so be.

Thirdly it may appear by that which has been said of an executor, that
the legacy is void where the testator has not animum testandi Infr. part. 7.

Fourthlie that there be diverse conditions, which do not make die legacy
conditional Infr.. 5. 6.

. Likewise if the testator give license to the legatarie, to enter to his
legacy: In this case the legatarie may without the priuitie or consent of the
executor take his legacy and keep the same, so that there be sufficient
besides to discharge the testators debts Ias in L. non dubiu^. C. de lega.
. Peradventure also in case of such sufficiency of goods, a certain special
thing being bequeathed (as the testators riding horse, his books, or his
signet) though an other person then the executor detain the same, the legatarie
may as well by the laws of this realm Brook Abridg. tit. devise. n. 6. 30.

, unless this third person were able to justify his possession, even against
the executor or against the testator himself if he were living: for that is a
lawful bar or exception against the legatarie also L. si rem legatum. ff de

. But if there be not sufficient goods to pay the testators debtes, or if
the legacy consiste in quantity or be general, (as if the testator bequeath
twenty pounds or a horse) the legatarie can not of his own authority take
so much of the testators money, nor any horse which was the testators without
license given by the testator or permission of the executor Brook. tit. devise.

Of a conditional assignation of an executor.
1 The chief points considerable about the conditional assignation of an
executor.

2 When the assignation of the executor is condutionall.

3 By what words the disposition is made conditional.

4 Of conditions some be necessary, some impossible, some indifferent or
possible.

5 What conditions be necessary.

6 Two sorts of necessary conditions.

7 Of impossible conditions there be diverse kinds.

8 Impossible by nature.

9 Impossible by law.

10 Impossible in respect of some persons.

11 Impossible by reason of contrariety or perplexity.

12 Possible conditions are those which are indifferent betwixt necessary and
impossible.

13 Of possible conditions, some be arbitrarie some casual, some mixed.

14 Item of possible conditions, some consiste in chancing, some in doing,
some in giving.

15 Of conditions some are affirmative, and some negative.

The assignation of an executor is conditional, Sichard. in Rub. de Instit.
and sub. C. n. 1. Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. legatum. q. 46.

sometimes made conditional, namely when it is joined to a verb of the future

be of the age of twenty one years Sichard in Rub. de Instit. and sub. C. n.

being dead) I make A.B. my executor Ripa. in L. centurio. ff. de vulg. and

the testators son be dead, but also the testators son if he be living, is
presumed to be assigned, during his life Ripa. vbi supr. Alex. consil. 185.

. Diverse other words there be whereby the disposition is made conditional,
wherein Bartolus Bar. in L. 1. de cond. and demon. ff.
has not only taken great pains, but has also been at some cost (as it
should seem) in making a great feast, marshalling together all such nowns,
pronownes, verbs, etc, which make the disposition conditional, to whom I
refer the reader to be satisfied.

Manifold are the divisions of conditions Vide Sichard. in Rub. de Instit. and

whereof there is a certain and infallible natural cause, by force whereof the
condition must necessarily follow: as if the testator make A.B. his executor,

conditions, which the law requires in every act, albeit the same were not

Of the effect of a conditional disposition.
1 Diverse and contrary effects of conditions.

2 Two rules whereof the former is, that necessary and impossible conditions
do not suspend the effect of the disposition.

3 Examples of this former rule.

4 The second rule is, that possible conditions do suspend the effect of the
disposition.

5 Example of the same rule.

6 Conditions partly certain, and partly uncertain, do suspend the effect
of the disposition.

7 Necessary conditions beeinge otherwise expressed then understood, suspend
the effect of the disposition.

8 Impossible conditions which the testator supposed to be possible, do
suspend the effect of the disposition.

9 Diverse restraintes of this last position beeinge the fourth limitation of
the former rule.

10 Very hard conditions or almost impossible, do suspend the effect of the
disposition.

11 A restraint of this last position being the fifte limitation.

12 Impossible conditions negatiuelie conceived, are not void themselves, but
make void the disposition.

13 A restraint of this last conclusion being the sixth limitation.

14 Conditions which become impossible being at the first possible, do hinder
the effect of the disposition.

15 A restraint of this conclusion being the seventh limitation of the former
rule.

16 The condition which is both impossible and dishonest makes void the
disposition.

17 Conditions which be impossible by reason of repugnancie, make void the
disposition.

18 A restraint of this last limitation.

19 Possible conditions do suspend the effect of the disposition until they
be accomplished.

20 Diverse limitations of this position being the second rule.

21 A further consideration of the former conclusions together with other
questions.

THe manifold diversity of conditions

Wherefore that we may know, when the condition is to be first
accomplished, before the executor can be admitted, or the legatarie demand his
legacy; and contrary wise when the executor may be admitted, or the
legatarie make his demand before the accomplishment of the condition; I
thought good to deliver two rules with their limitations.

extreme, that is to say, either necessary or impossible, such condition
hinders not the executor nor legatarie, but that he may be admitted to the
executorship or recover the legacy, as if such had not L. si pupillus.. qui

: for example, the testator does make thee his executor, or does give thee a
hundred pound if the sun shall arise upon Easter day Paul. de Castr. in d.
L. si pupillus.. qui sub condic. Sichar. in Rub. de Instit. and sub. C. n. 7.
: Or if the testator does make thee his executor, or gives thee a hundred
pound if thou shall drink up all the water in the sea Minsing in.

; both these conditions are extreme, the one necessary, the other impossible:
and therefore in these two cases thou may be admitted executor, or obtain
the legacy, as if the disposition had been simple or without any such
condition Per LL. supradictas.
.

when the condition is not extreme, but indifferent or possible, then the same
condition must first be satisfied before the executor can be admitted, or the
legatarie recover his legacy L. qui haeredi. de co^d. and demon. L. si quis

. Venice; this condition is indifferent, neither necessary nor impossible. In
the mean time therefore until the same condition be extant, thou can
neither be executor nor obtain the legacy by force of that disposition d L.
qui haered. and ibii gloss. Bar. and alij.
. Minsing. in. haeres. Instit. de haered. instit.
To return to the former rule the same is diversely limited or restrained.

The first limitation thereof may be this, that albeit that condition which by
course of nature nihil interesse vtru^ testator dixerit si morietur, vel cum
morietur prius per Bar. Castrens. and Alex in L. extraneum. el. 1. C. de
haered. instit. quorum opinio communis est, ait Alex. in d. L. extranaeu^.
licet secus sit in contractibus.
: howsoever this condition be certain in respect of death, because it is not
certain in respect of the time of his death, therefore in the mean time the
executor or legatarie, where there is such a condition can not obtain the
executorshippe or legacy, but must expect the event of the condition Paul. de
Castr. and Ias. in d. L. extraneum. Sichard. in d. Rub. de Instit, and sub. C.
.

An other limitation to the former rule is L. haec verba. ff. de leg. 1.
: Nevertheless, if the condition be expressed in other manner then is
understood, the disposition is thereby made conditional L. si ita.. illi. ff.
de leg. 1.
; so that in the mean time, the effect thereof is suspended, as for example,
the testator says, I give to A.B. twenty pound if he will d.. illi. ibi, si
volet, id est, si se velle declarauerit.
. In which case except the legatarie do by some means declare his
willingness, the legacy is not due, and if he die in the mean time, before
he have declared his willingness, the legacy is not transferred to the
executor or administrator of the legatarie Ias. and alij in d.. illi. Quaere
tamen, isto siquidem casu distinguit Practic. Papiens. in forma libelli, pro
legate. rei singular. fol. 455.
, whereas if no such condition had been expressed, but that the legacy had
been left simply, then albeit the legatarie had died not knowinge of the
said bequest, his executors or administrators might have obtained the same
Bar. Zas. and alij in d. L. haec verba. ff. de leg. 1.
.

The third limitation is, when it does appear to be the testators meaning,
by the expressing of the said necessary condition to make the disposition
conditional Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. legatum. q. 47. vbi etiam ostenditur
quomodo appareat huiusmodi testatoris voluntas.
.

L. 3. ff. de cond. and demon.. impossibilis. Instit. de haered. instit. Grass.
Thesaur. com. op.. legatum. q. 50.
: Nevertheless if the testator did suppose the same condition to be possible
or lawful, then is not the condition void but the disposition whereunto it is
added L. seruo manumiss. ff. de cond. indebit.
. As for the example, the testator makes A.B. his executor, or gives him a
hundred pound if he marry his, the testators daughter, supposing her to be
living whereas she is dead: in this case the condion is impossible, for the
legatarie can not marry a dead woman: And yet nevertheless, because the
testator did think her to be living, and so the condition to be possible. A.B.
cannot be executor, nor obtain the legacy, for it is not likely, that the
testator would have made him executor, or have given him a hundred pound, if he
had known or believed his daughter to have been dead DD. in d L. serve
manumisso.
. Howbeit there be diverse cases, wherein the disposition is not void by reason
of an impossible condition, which the testator did account possible and
lawful, but the condition itself is void howsoever it seemed possible in the
opinion of the testator: one is where the condition may be accomplished by
some equivalent means though not in the same manner described in the
disposition L. huiusmodi. si ita cui. ff. de leg. 1. Bar. in L. 1. de con. and
demon. ff. Ias. in d. L. si ita.. illi. de leg. 1.
. An other case is, when the testator after the making of his will
understanding the condition to be impossible, did nevertheless confirm his
will by codicils Ias. in d. L. seruo manumiss. Arc. in L impossib. de verb. ob.
ff.
. The like is, when the testator was doubtful whether the condition were
possible or no Bar in L. ab omnibus.. in testo^. de leg. 1. Arc. in L.
impossibilis de verb. ob. Ias. in d. L. seruo manumiss. de cond. indeb. ff.
, or the bequest were in favor of liberty L. ciuitatem.. falsum iuncta gloss.
de cond. and demon. L. cum Stichus. de statu lib. ff. and Ias. in d. L. seruo.
, or in fauorem piae causae, when the testator does bequeath any thing to be
employed to godly uses, for then the condition which he supposed possible is
rejected, and the disposition available as pure and simple Bald, in L. 1. C.
de com. seruo. manumiss. Bar. in L proxime.. 1. de his quae in testa. del. ff.
and clarius per Ias. in d. L. seruo manumiss.
.

The fifth, is when the condition is not utterly Sichard. in Rub. de Instit.
and sub. C. Minsin. in. impossibilis. Instit. de haered. instituend.
, and therefore in this case the condition does suspend the effect of the
disposition, until the condition perhaps be accomplished L. cum haeres.. 1.
de statu lib. L. continuus.. illud. de verb. ob. ff.
. Notwithstanding if the L. si mihi and tibi, 1. ff. de leg. 1.
, for that it respects the execution and not the substance of the will. And
it is to be understood that the testator would have it performed with as great
expedition as is possible Ias. Lanc. Dec. and alij in d.. 1. Zas. in L.
continuus.. illud. de verb. ob. ff.
.

. L. vltim. Instit. de lega. in fin. L. ab eo. C. de fideicom. L. vnic. C. de

: The reason is, because the executor who otherwise should have the same thing
bequeathed, is not to be punished for not doing that thing which is impossible
or dishonest Minsing. in d.. vlt. Instit. lega. Castrens. in d. L. vnic. C. de
his. Paen
. But if the negative impossible condition be not set down in way of penalty
but simply, the disposition is not void but takes effect presently: as for
example, the testator makes A. B. his executor or gives him an hundred pound,
if he do not drink up all the water in the sea: In this case (if any were so
fond as to add any such condition) the effect of the disposition is not
hindered, and so A.B. is to be admitted executor, or may obtain the legacy, as
if no condition were expressed L. impossibilis. de verb. ob. ff. Bar. and alij
in eand. L. Paul. de Castro. in d. L. vnic. quem videas.
.

void, but makes the disposition void: for example, the testator makes A.B.
his executor, or gives him a hundred pound if he marie his, the testators
daughter: afterward and before marriage this woman dies, whereby the
condition is made impossible: In this case the condition although now
impossible is not void, but makes void the disposition; and so A.B. cannot be
executor, nor obtain the legacy by virtue of such disposition Mantic. de
coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 16. n. 23.
. But if the Infr. ead. part.. 8.
, is more fully declared.

The eight is when the condition is both Bald. in L. si pater. de Instit. and
sub. C. n. 5.
, whereas if the condition had been only impossible or unlawful, the
disposition had been good, and that in favor of the testament Gloss. in.
impossibilis. Inst. de haered. instit. aliud autem in contractibus obtinet.
.

The ninth is when the condition is impossible by reason of perplexity,
whereof there is example before, for then the disposition is void L. vbi
repugnantia. de reg. iur. ff. and ibi Cagnol. limitans eand. reg. gloss. in d..
impossibilis. add Petr. Duen. Tract. reg. and fall. verb. conditio: vbi
tradidit tres limitationes.
.

The tenthe is, when the condition is repugnant Infr. ead. part.. 11.
. Notwithstanding if the repugnancie be not in such sort but that it may be
reconciled, it hurts not the disposition Cagnol. in d. L. vbi repugnantia. de
reg. iur. ff.
: And therefore if the executor do name two executors, for example, his son
and his daughter with a condition or prouiso that his daughter do not
administer: albeit here seem a repugnancie in the assignation of the daughter,
for that it is the office of every executor to administer: yet because the
same may be reconciled, the daughter is to be admitted to the executorshippe,
namely, to prosecute any action, though not to administer further of any
goods whereof they are in possession or which shall after be by action so
recovered Brook Abridg. tit. executor. n. 2.
.

The eleventh limitation is, when the dishonest condition is referred to the
time past, for then it is not rejected, but does either presently confirm or
infirm Couar. Tract: de spo^sal. part. 2. c. 3.. 1. n. 9.
the effect of the disposition.

Now that we have seen the limitations of the first rule, let us take a view
of the limitations when the condition is possible, the effect of the
disposition is suspended, until the condition be accomplished. So that he
which is made executor or to whom any thing is bequeathed under such
condition, can not be admitted to the executorshippe, nor obtain the legacy in
the mean time L. qui haered. de cond. and demon. L. si quis sub condition. Si
quis omiss. causa. testa. L. caedere diem. de verb. sig. ff. Grass. Thesaur.
co. op.. legatu^. q. 52. Simo de Praetis. de interp. vl. vo. li. 5. Interp 2.
dub. 2. n. 109.
: In so much that it is not enough to perform the condition by an other
equivalent means, but it must be accomplished in that precise manner and form
of the condition, without varyinge in any one jot L. qui haeredi. L. Me uius.
de cond. and demon. f^.
.

it does not stand by the executor or legatary wherefore the conditon is not
performed: for then it is accounted to be accomplished c. Imputari. de reg.
iur. lib. 6.
. An other limitation is this, when the condition is negative, for there the
executor or legatary may in the mean time be admitted to the executorship, or
recover the legacy entering first into bond to make restitution, L. Mutianae.
ff. de cond. and demon.
if the condition be not performedo.

The third limitation is when the condition was once accomplished, though it do
not continue L. in substitutione. ff. de vulg. sub.
.

The fourth limitation is, when the condition is possible in respect of fact
but not lawful L. filius. ff. de cond. instituc. supra ead. par.. 5.
.

But for as much as none of these conclusions

First whether every possible condition ought to be observed preciselie and ad
vnguem Infr. ead. part.. prox.
.

Secondly, whether it be sufficient for the executor or legatary that it stand
not by them, wherefore the condition is accomplished Infr. ead. part.. 8.
.

Thirdly, when and in what cases the executor or legatarie is to be admitted to
the executorship, or may obtain his legacy before the accomplishment of the
condition by entringe into bond Infr. ead. part.. 9.
.

Fourthly, whether it be sufficient that the condition was once performed,
though it do not so endure Infr. ead. part.. 10.
.

Fiftlie, whereas it may be doubted of diverse conditions, whether they be
lawful or no: I have declared how far the same be lawful or unlawful Infr.
ead. part.. 11, 12, 13.
.

Unto the which questions I have also added these following.

Within what time the condition may or must be accomplished, when no certain
time is limited by the testator Infr. ead. part.. 14.
.

Than how that usual condition (if he die without issue) is to be understood,
or when it is said to be accomplished Infr. ead, part.. 15.
.

Finally, what order is to be taken concerning the administration or
possession of the goods of the deceased, whiles the condition of the
institution of the executor depends unaccomplished Infr. ead. part.. 16.
.

Whether every possible condition ought to be observed preciselie.
1 Conditions are of a strict interpretation.

2 Conditions inducing a form are to be observed preciselie.

3 Examples hereof.

4 When the testator does respect the end it skilleth not of the means.

5 Voluntary conditions are to be observed preciselie, not necessary
conditions.

6 He in whose favor the condition is made, may consent to other means.

7 The condition of payment to be made to the infant is satisfied by payment
to the tutor.

8 In substitutions it suffices that the condition be effected by other
equivalent means.

9 In favor of liberty or of godly uses the condition need not to be
preciselie observed.

10 Whether the condition may be performed by an other person then him that is
named in the condition.

11 Where the law allows other means the precise form need not to be
observed.

FOr as much as conditions are Michael. Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. legatu^. q.

, and to induce a form to every disposition, whereunto they are joined Bald.

Tiraquel. de retract.. 1. gloss. 11. n. 11 Peckius in c. cum nom. de reg. iur.
in 6. n. 6.
. Therefore it is holden for a rule that every possible condition ought to be
Grass. Thesaur. com. op. legatum. q. 52. vbi attestatur de communi opinione.
or in any other manner then is prescribed. For example, the testator makes
Gloss. and DD. in L. si quis haeredem. C. de Instit. and sub. and haec est
communis opinio, vt per Michael. Grass. d.. legatum. q. 52. n. 3.
: Nevertheless, if thou did first know of the condition, thou art
presumed to have given the ten pound with a mind to perform the condition,
unless the contrary do appear Bar. and Paul. de Cast. in L. 2. de cond. and
demon. ff.
: So that it is not necessary to protest or to affirm by words, that thou
did give the ten pound with a mind or intent to perform the condition,
seeing the same is presumed unless the contrary be proved Bar. and Paul. de
Cast. in d. L. 2.
. An other example to the same effect is this, the testator makes thee his
executor or gives thee a hundred pound if thou pay ten pound to C.D. before
a certain time, within which time C. D. dies, and thou paiest the same ten
pound within the same time, to the executor or administrator of C.D. in this
case the condition is not said to be performed, and so thou can not be
executor nor obtain the legacy of a hundred pound, because thou did not
pay the ten pound to C.D. himself, for the payment ought to have been made
to C.D. himself L. sub diuersis.. vlt. and ibi Bar. de cond. and demon. ff.
Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol lib. 11. tit. 17. n. 25. and hoc quidem sine

potest per d. vlt sed an idem iuris sic in haerede haeredis, quaest^o est magis
dubia, de qua legendus est Mantic. vbi supr.
, and not to his executors or administrators.

Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 16. n. 3
.

by the testator, or in any other good manner Bar. in L. Gallus.. quid si
tantum. n. 2. de lib. and posthu. ff. Grass. Thesaur. com. op. legatum. q. 52.
Simo de Praetis. de interp. vlt. vol. lib. 1. in fin. vbi etiam respondit
quaenam conditio sit dicenda necessaria, vel voluntaria.
.

The third limitation is, when the person Simo de Praetis. de interp. vl. vo.
lib. 1. solue. vlt. n. 34.
for example, the testator makes thee his executor or gives thee a hundred
pound, if thou give to A.B. ten pound: So it is that A.B. did owe unto thee
ten pound, and is contented to be released of that ten pound which he
owes, in steed of that ten pound which he is to receive: In this case the
condition shall be accounted for accomplished, as if the ten pound had
been reallie paid Simo vbi supr. licet ortasse contrarium obtineat in
co^tractibus, attenta dispositione huius regni Angliae. Perkins. tit. condit.
fol. 146.
. These three limitations (especially the first of them,) be so general, that
they may seem to comprehend the residue of the limitations, nevertheless it
shall not be amiss, if I express them for the better understanding of those
former limitations.

The fourth limitation therefore is this, L si fundus. ff. de cond. and demon.
for example, thou art made executor, or a hundred pound is bequeathed to
thee, if thou pay unto the testators son (being an infant) ten pound: in this
case the condition is sufficiently performed, if payment be made to the tutor
of the child d. L si fundus. Grass. d.. legatum. q. 52. Ma^tic. de coniect.
vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 17. n. 29.
: especially if the money be conuertede to the benefitte of the child Bar. in
d. L. si fundus. Mantic. d. tit. 17. n. 29.
. And albeit this condition may be said to be a voluntary condition, because
it does consist in giving, yet in this case the testator is presumed to have
more regard to the condition, namely, the benefit of the child, then to the
form of the condition: For if payment should be made to the child, it might
easily be consumed and do the child little benefit Mantic. vbi supr.
, and therefore better for the child, and more agreeable to the meaning of the
testator, and more safe for him that paieth the money, to pay the same to the
tutor, rather then to the infant Alciat. de verb. signif lib. 3. col. 81. in
fin.
.

Paul. de Castr. in L si magister. C. de Instit. and sub. n. 2. in fin.
. For example, the testator makes his son executor, and if he will not, he
does substitute thee executor in his steed if the testators son can not be
executor, in this case thou shall be executor, as if he had refused to be
executor, although respecting the form of the condition thou art substitute
only in case the other will not, and not in case he cannot: the reason is,
because in substitutions the law presumes that the testator does more
regard the effect, then the form of the condition Paul. de Castr. vbi supr.
Alciat. de verb. signif. lib. 3. reg. 4. q. 3.
.

Bar. in L. Maenius de cond. and demon. ff.
.

The seventh limitation is when that which is left conditionally is to be
distributed in pios vsus: for in these two limitations it is sufficient, that
the condition be effected by other equivalent means, though not according to
the precise literal form of the condition Bar. in d. L. Maenius. cum addic.
ibid.
.

The eight limitation is, when the condition Bar. in L. Arethusa. de stat. hom.
ff. and in L. fin. de cond. instit ff. atque hoc est magis common, test
Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 17. n. 10.
.

The ninth limitation is, when the condition can not be performed in such
manner as is prescribed in the condition: as for example, the testator gives a
sum of money if so many sermons be made in such a church within such a time,
during which time the church is interdicted, by occasion whereof the condition
can not be accomplished: In this case the disposition is not absolutely void L.
legatum. de admistr. rerum. ad ciuit. pertin. ff.
, but the money may be converted to some godly use Simo de Praetis. de
interp. vlt. vol. lib. 1. in fin.
.

The tenth limitation is, when the law does Infr.. proxim.
.

Whether the condition be accounted for accomplished in law, when it does
not stand by the executor or legatarie wherefore the same is not accomplished.
1 No man to be punished but such as be faulty.

2 He is not reputed faulty in law who does what he can.

3 Whether the condition be reputed for accomplished if it stand not by the
party.

4 Certain distinctions about the former question.

5 Arbitrarie conditions are accounted for accomplished if it do not stand by
the party.

6 The reason of the former conclusion.

7 Arbitrarie conditions are not accounted for accomplished where the party is
in fault.

8 Casual conditions are not reputed to be accomplished before the event.

9 The reason of the different effect, betwixt casual and arbitrarie
conditions.

10 Certain cases wherein casual conditions be reputed as accomplished,
albeit the same be not so in deed.

11 In mixed conditions this consideration is first to be had, how the
impediment comes.

12 The impediment in mixed conditions may happen diverse ways.

13 When it stands by him by whom the condition is to be preformed, the same
is not reputed for complete.

14 What if after first refusal he consent, and then the other party is
willing.

15 A restraint of the last position.

16 When it stands by the party in whom the condition is to be performed,
the same is not reputed for complete.

17 A limitation of the former conclusion.

18 When the testator does hinder the performance of the condition, it hurts
not the executor or legatarie.

19 When a third person does hinder the performance of the condition, whether
it hurt the executor or legatarie.

20 The accomplishment of the condition being hindered by casual means,
whether it hurt the executor or legatarie.

. viij.
IT agrees with equity and humanity c. sine culpa. de reg. iur. 6.
, and it seems that he Peckius. in c. imputari. de reg. iur. 6.
, wherefore no marvel if at the first view it seem true, that when it does
not stand by the executor or legatarie, wherefore the condition is not
performed (they doing whatsoever in them lies for to accomplish the same;)
that then the same should be accounted as it had been fully performed c. cum
non stat. c. imputari. de reg. iur. lib. 6.
. And in deed so it is regularlie for the most part very true d. c. cum non
stat. d. c. imputari. de reg. iur. lib. 6.
but this rule does not take place perpetually.

Wherefore if we will understand when Supr. ead. part.. 5.
, especially this: That of conditions some be arbitrary, such as the law
presumes to be in the will and power of the man to whom they are imposed L.
vnic.. sin autem. C. de cad. tollend. Vigli. and Minsing. in. Pen. Instit. de
haered. instit.
: Some be casual, such as are not in the power of that man to whom they are
imposed, but either in the power of some other thing, or person, so that the
event thereof is to us uncertain d.. sin autem.
: and some be mixte conditions such as do consist partly in our own power,
and partly in the power of some other thing or person d.. sin autem. Vigl. and
Minsing. vbi supr.
, for example of which several conditions I refer the reader to those former
which I have there set down Supr. ead. part.. 5.
.

arbitrarie, then if it stand not by him, by whom the condition is to be
performed, the law reputeth the same as if it were fully accomplished, though
in deed it remain unperformed: L. quae sub condition.. 1. ff. de cond.
Instit. Bar. in L. 1. C. de Instit. and sub.
for example, the testator does make thee his executor, or gives thee a
hundred pound if thou ^oe to church on Easter day Hoc esse exemplum
po^tatiuae conditionis, patet ex Sichardo in Rub. de Instit. and sub. C. n. 9.
and Minsingero, in. Pen. Inst. de haered. inst. n. 2. quorum alter profert

in hoc exemplo, si ascenderis capitolium. DD. in d.. sin autem. C. de cad. tol.
and in d.. Pen. Instit. de haered. instituend.
, that day being ^ome; by reason of ouerflowing of waters or some other
necessary impediment, thou art not then able to go to the church being
otherwise willing to go, if thou had not been hindered. In this case thou
art to be admitted executor, and may recover thy legacy, as if thou
had d. L. quae sub. condition.. 1. ff. de condic. Instit. and. c. imputari
de reg iur. 6.
; the reason wherefore the condition is accounted for accomplished in law,
albeit respecting the fact it is not accomplished, I suppose to be this,
because the testator is presumed to have more regard to thy good will and
endeavor, in these conditions which be within thy power, then to the event of
the condition Sichard. post Bar. and Bald. in d. L. 1. C. de Inst. and sub.
, so that by satisfying the expectation of the testator, thou haste also
satisfied the exaction of law DD. in d. L. 1.
.

Howbeit even there also where the condition Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib.
11. tit. 16. n. 24. post Bar. and Bald. in d. L. 1. C. de Instit. and sub.
: for example, the testator makes A.B. his executor or gives him a hundred
pound, if he go to the church on such a day: upon the which day A.B.
intending to accomplish the condition, proceeds toward the church, and as he
is going commits some crime or offense, whereupon he is arested and stayed,
so that he can not go to the church according to his purpose: In this case
the condition is not accounted for accomplished, for that he, by whom the
condition was to be accomplished Bar. and Bald. vbi supr. gloss in c. imputari
de reg. iur. 6. Aymo Crauetta. consil. 202. n. 8.
, was himself in the fault, and the cause wherefore the same was not
accomplished. So it is if the condition can not be performed, by the
negligence or delaie of the person, by whom the same ought to have been
performed Bar. in d. L. 1. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 16. n.
14.
: and although an impediment is said to excuse a man from delaie DD. omnes in
L. quod te ff. si cer. Pe.
, yet when the impediment may be foreseen and prevented, such impediment
shall not excuse him which does not avoid the same Gloss. and DD. in d. L. quod
te. Zas. post alios in L. continuus.. illud. ff. de verb. ob.
. If thou crave an example, let this be the same, the testator makes thee his
executor, or gives thee a hundred pound if thou go to the church within two
months, during the first month thou do not go, duringe the second thou
know thou shall not be able to go by reason of some impediment, be it by
occasion of wars, or of the weather, or of the way, or of some infirmity in
thy own body and then being let, thou make an offer to go, and do
protest that it does not stand by thee, and that thou would go if it were
possible: Neither this protestation nor this impediment will relieve thee
because thou did wittinglie fall into these difficulties, and would not
go when thou might safely have gone c. Mona. de reg. iur. 6. Zas. in d..
illud. n. 6. fall. 4. and Peckius in L. fin. ad L. Rhodiam. de iactu.
. When casual, the same is neither accounted for accomplished or extant in
presumption or fiction of law, neither yet for unaccomplished or deficient,
until the actual event of the same condition do first come to pass L.
vnic.. sin autem. C. de cad. tol. and ibi Bar
: And therefore if the testator make thee his executor or give thee a hundred
pound, if the king of Spain die this year Vigli. and Minsing. in pen.
Instit. de haered. instituend.
: In this case until the event do indeed declare whether k the K. die this
year or no, the condition is neither accounted for extant or deficient, but is
suspended Sichard. in Rub. de instit. and sub. C.
. And if he die, then is the condition said to be purified or extant, and so
thou art to be admitted, otherwise not L. vnic.. sin autem. C. de cad. tol.
. So there is a great difference, whether the condition be arbitrarie or
casual, for the one is diverse times accounted for accomplished in law though
not in fact: but the other is not accounted for accomplished or extant in law,
unless the same be accomplished in fact also Eod. sin autem.
. The reason of the difference Sichard. Bar. Bald. and fere omnes interp. in L.
1. de instit. and sub. C.
, and so it is sufficient that it stand not by him, that the same condition is
not performed: But herein casual conditions, for as much as the testator does
not refer it to that which is in his power on whom the condition is laid,
therefore the testator is thought to refer the force or effect of this
disposition, to the determination of fortune Paul. de Castr. in L. quae sub.
condition. ff. de condic. institu.
, (or rather to speak more christianlie, to the will of God,) and therefore this
event of gods will must decide the doubt, I mean whether he that is appointed
under such condition shall be executor or not, or obtain his legacy or not.
Notwithstanding sometimes even Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 16.
n. 15.
. The first case is, where the testator would have so disposed howsoever the
condition should fall out Gloss. in L. 1. C. de instit. and sub.
. The second is when by his fact, the acco^plishment of the condition is
hindered, to whom it is beneficial that the same should never be performed L.
iure civilly. ff. de cond. and demon.
. The third case is in favor of freedom or liberty from servitude L. fin. C.
de necessar. instituend.
.

If we will know when a mixed condition fact the same be not performed, we must
consider by what means the impediment is ministered, person by whom the
condition is to be performed, or from that person to whom the condition is to
be performed, or from the testator himself who devised the condition, or from
some other third person, or whether it happen by some other means according to
the secret purpose and will of God, which we no less foolishlie then
commonly, call Chance or fortune.

, for (conditio) and (modus) do greatly differ, as in the next paragraphe is
declared.

Whether he that is made executor, or to whom any legacy is given
conditionally, may in the mean time, whiles the condition depends, be
admitted to the executorship, or obtain the legacy, by entering into bonds to
perform the condition, or else to make restitution.
1 Diverse kinds of conditions to be remembered in this question.

2 When the condition is affirmative it suffices not to put in bonds.

3 What if the affirmative do also implie a negative.

4 What if the disposition be made sub modo, and not sub condition.

5 How Modus and Conditio do differ.

6 When the testators will is not repugnaunt, then it suffices to put in bond.

7 If the condition be negative, then what things are to be regarded?

8 If the condition consist in not doing, then it is material whether the same
may be accomplished during life.

9 If the condition can not be accomplished duringe life, then it suffices to
put in bond, to the effect aforesaid.

10 Example of such condition as can not be accomplished during life.

11 The reason of devising this bond, and who was the inuentor thereof.

12 Certain cases wherein the legacy may be obtained without bond, being
given upon condition, which may seem not to be accomplished duringe life.

13 If the condition negative may be accomplished during his life, to whom it
is imposed, this caution has no place.

14 A condition negative is said to be accomplished when it cannot be
infringed.

15 Great odds whether the condition may be accomplished during his life, to
whom it is imposed or not.

16 What if the negative condition can not be infringed without sorrow.

17 If the condition consist in not giving, then we must inquire and resolve as
in the condition of not doing.

18 When the condition does consiste in not happening, then this bond has no
place.

19 The form of the bond, to whom it is to be made, and whether sureties be
necessary.

. ix.
IF any be desirous to know whether caution either to perform such condition,
or else to make full restitution of al things by him received: It shall be
behoofull to call to his remembrance how many kinds of possible conditions
there be De quibus. supra. ead. part.. 5.
, especially he must not forget, that of these conditions some be
affirmative, and some be negative L in facto. ff. de cond. and demon.
: and again, that as well of the affirmative as of the negative, there be three
sorts, that is to say, some consist in chancing, some in giving, and some in
doing, and on the contrary, some consist in not chauncinge, some in not
giving, and some in not doing d. L. in facto.
. Now to apply these distinctions to the question.

affirmative (whether it do consist in chauncing, giving, or doing:) he that
is made executor, or to whom any legacy is given, under such condition,
cannot be admitted to the executorship, nor demand the legacy by virtue of
the last will or testament of the deceased, so long as the same condition
depends unfulfilled, or is not extant L. Mutian. in ff. de cond. and demon.
and gloss. ac DD. ibid.
, albeit the executor or legatarie should put in sufficient bond to make
restitution, in case the condition should be deficient: For the event of such
affirmative condition is to be expected and must be extant, before the
disposition of the testator can take effect L. qui haeredi. ff. de cond. and
demon^ D. in d. L. Mu^^an.
, except in L. par^^^. socrus ff. de cond. and demon. Bar. and Paul. (...)
Castr. in d. L. Mut^a^^^. Ripa. in L. ita scipula^^^s. ff. de verb. ob. ff. n.
46.
: as for example, the testator makes his wife executrix, or gives her a
hundred pound, if she abide with his children; which affirmative condition, (if
she abide with his children) consists in dooinge, and does withal secretly
implie a negative, that is to say, (If she do not depart from his children
Bar. and Paul. de Cast. in d. L. Mutianae. per. d.. soc^^^.
:) and therefore in this case, the executor or legatarie, by entering into
sufficient bond to perform the condition, or else to make restitution, is to
be admitted to the executorship or may obtain the legacy, as if the negative
had been expressed Bar. and Paul. Castr. vbi supra. Simo de Pretis. de interp.
vlt. vol. lib. 5. interp 2. dub. 1. n. 24. 25. fol. 42.
. An other case is, when sub condition, sed sub modo L 1. C. de his quae sub
modo. L. quibus diebus. Termilius. ff de cond. and demon. verum prop^^e

Bald. in Auth. cui C. de indict. vid. n. 22. in sin.
. For thou shall understand, that conditio modus do differ, Conditio is a
quality which so long as it depends unperformed or is not extant, does
hinder the effect of the disposition, so that, that thing which is disposed
conditionally, can neither be demanded, neither is due in the mean time
Bald. and Sichard. in Rub. de Instit. and sub. C.
: Modus is a moderation, whereby a charge or burden is imposed, in respect of
a commodity, which moderation does not so far hinder the effect of the
disposition, but that the thing disposed is due, and may be demanded in the
mean time Bar. in d. L. quibus diebus.. Termilius. de cond. and demon ff.
Sichard. in d. Rub. de Instit. and sub. C. Grass. Thesau. com. op.. legatum. q.
58. Modus (inquit Cuiacius) est finis, propter quem legatur, vel causa legandi
collata in futurum. Cuiac. in tit. de his quae sub mod. C.
: and it is called modus a moderando. The one of them is thus known from the
other, that is to say, the condition is commonly known by this word (if) or
by words of like value Bald. and Sichard. in Rub. de Inst. and sub. C.
, whereof I have given examples before Supra. ead. part. 5.
: the mean or moderation is known by this word (that) as I make A. B. my
executor or give him a hundred pound, that he may erect a monument. Bar. in
d.. Term^lius. and Sichard. in d. Rub. de Instit. and sub. C.
Now in this case when any thing is left under a moderation or with the
exaction of a remuneration, that thing which is so bequeathed, is presently
due and may now also be demanded, so that he which makes demand do enter
into bond in manner as hereafter is described, to perform that which is
exacted by the testator, or else to make L. quibus diebus.. Termilius. ff. de
cond. and demon. L. 1. 2. C. de his quae sub modo.
. An other case is, when the testators will is not repugnant thereunto: for
then this bond (as it is affirmed) has place even in affirmative conditions
Bar. in d. L. Mutianae. de cond. and demon, ff. n. 3.
.

negative, then we are to regard what kind of negative condition it is, that
is to say, whether the same consist in not doing or not giving or not
chauncing.

not doing, then it is material, whether the same may be accomplished so long
as he lives on whom the same is imposed, yea, or no.

can not be performed so long as the person, on whom it was imposed lives,
then may he obtain the bequest, by puttinge in bonds to accomplish the
condition, or else in defect thereof to make d. L. Mutianae and ibi Bar Bal^.
and Paul d^ Ca^^r. Zas. in L. dedi tibi. ff. de cond. cause. dor.
: as for example, the testator makes one his executor or gives him a hundred
pound, if he never play at the Cards or Dice: This condition we see is
negative, it consists in not doing, and it is such a condition withal, as
can not be fully performed, so long as he lives on whom it is imposed,
because at any time during his life, he may infringe the same, by playing at
the Cards or Dice S^m^ de Praetis. de interp. vlt. vol. lib. 5. inter. 2. Iub.
1. n. 23.
, for albeit he did abstain this day, yet might he play the next day, or
if not the next day, yet some one day, or other so long as he had any
days to live Simo de Praetis. vbi supr. Paul. de Castr. in d. L. Mutianae.
, and so in the mean time, that is to say, all his life long he should not
reap any commodity by the testament, if the full performaunce of the
condition were first exacted. Wherefore least the testators Mutius Sceuola did
devise this remedy, that he who is made executor, or to whom any legacy is
bequeathed, upon a condition negative, which could not be fully performed
duringe his life, should enter into bond to perform the condition, (that is
to say, never to do that which is prohibited, or else to make a full
restitution) and by that means obtain the executorshippe, or legacy d. L.
Mutianae. cum gloss. ibid. Simo de Praetis. vbi supr. Zas. in L. ded^ tibi. de
cond. cause. dot. ff. n. 7. 9.
, which bond or caution is of Mutius the author thereof, called Mutiana cautio
Gloss. in d. L. Mutianae.
, and after a sort has the effect of the full accomplishment of the
condition ^ar. and Castr. in d. L. Mutianae.
. Yea in some cases the legacy which is given under a condition L. libertatem.
L. libertas.. 1. de manumiss. testa. ff.
, and in a legacy ad pias causas Tiraquel. de priuileg. piae causae. c. 48.
: The reason of the difference is, because in these favorable legacies the
testator is presumed to have meante only of the first act when the
legatarie had opportunity of doing the thing prohibited Tiraquel. vbi supra.
: So that if at that season or first opportunity, the legatarie do not
infringe the condition by doing contrary to the disposition of the testator,
it is not hurtefull though after that first opportunity past the legatarie go
against the condition Gloss. in L. Titio.. fundus. ff. de cond. and demon.

the condition should be extended to every act during the life of the legatarie

.

may be performed during his life on whom it is imposed, this aforesaid bond
or caution has no place L. cum tale.. 1. ff. de cond. and demon. L. pater..
socrus. eod.
, and consequently the executorship or legacy disposed under such condition,
so long as the same depends not fully performed, can not be obtained L. cu^
tale.. 1. and gloss. in d. L. Mutianae.
; For example, the testator makes thee his executor, or gives thee a C. pound
if thou never play at dice or cards with A.B. or if thou do not at any time
give away thy lands to A.B. this condition howsoever it be negative, and also
consists in not giving, or not doing: Yet it may be fully and perfectly
co^plete and performed in thy life time: For A. B. with who^ thou art forbidden
to play, or to who^ thou art forbidden to give thy lands, may die before thee,
and then thou can not play with him nor give him thy lands when he is dead,
and so it is evident, that this condition may be fully performed, and
accomplished in thy life time, for accomplished, when it is brought to an
impossibility Gloss. and. DD. in d. L. Mutianae. ff. de cond. and demon.
, and therefore in this case thou can not be admitted executor nor obtain
the legacy, until the condition be brought into that state, that it can not
be infringed DD. in d. L. Mutianae. and d. L. cum tale.. 1. Simo de Praetis. de
inter. vlt. vol. lib. 5. interp. 2. dub. 1. n. 23.
. Great ods d. L. cum tale. L. pater.. socrus. ff. de cond. and demon.
: as for example, the testator makes his wife executrix or gives her a
hundred pound if she depart not from her children: This condition may be
extant in the life time of the mother, for it may happen the children to die,
and the mother to ouerliue, and then the condition must needs be extant, for
after their death she cannot infring the condition by departing from them that
are not: nevertheless, because the death of the child is a hard and heavy
thing to the mother, therefore the law is not so hard, but that in this case
the condition depending, the mother is to be admitted to the executorship, and
may recover the legacy upon bonds, to accomplish the condition, or else to
make restitution d. L. cum tale. and gloss. in d. L. Mutianae.
.

not giving, then as before, we are to enquire whether the condition be such as
the same can not be accomplished during his life, on whom it is imposed: for if
it be such a condition, that which is disposed under such a condition may be
obtained by entering bond as before d. L. Mutianae. ff. de condic. and demon.
: for example, the testator does make thee his executor, or does bequeath
unto thee a hundred pound if thou do not give away thy lands L. 4.. idem
Iulianus. ff. de condic. instit.
, this condition can not be fully performed, but by thy death, because so
long as thou live thou may give away thy lands, and so infringe the
condition DD. in d.. idem Iulianus.
, wherefore least the testators will should be deluded, or thy self
defrauded, thou may be admitted to the executorship or obtain the legacy
in the mean time so that thou become bounden as before, to perform the
condition or else to make full restitution. d. L. Mutianae. Simo de Praetis. de
interp. vlt. vol. lib. 5. Interp. 2. dub. 1. n. 23.


not chauncing, then this bond or condition can not be admitted, neither can
the thing disposed under such condition be obtained before the condition be
performed d. L. Mutianae. and ibi Bar. and alij.
: And therefore (for example) if the testator make thee his executor or give
thee a hundred pound if thy ship do not return from Spain, in this case the
event of the condition is to be expected. And if it so come to pass that thy
ship does return, then is the condition deficient, and so thou can not be
admitted to the executorshippe, nor obtain the legacy by virtue of the said
disposition Bar. and Paul. Castr. in d. L. Mutianae. L. vnic.. sin autem. C. de
cad. tol.
: But if the Ship can not return (which thing may happen by ship-wracke,
or by some other accident) and so all hope or possibility taken away, then
the condition is said to be accomplished or extant, and so thou art to be
admitted to the executorship, or may recover the legacy, as if the
disposition had been simple Idem Paul. de Castr. in d. L. Mutianae. d.. sin
autem.
.

Now that we have seen in what cases (not to do that thing which is
contained in the condition, or else to restore the things disposed together
with all the mean fruits and profits thereof L. cum filius.. qui Mutianam.
ff. de leg. 2.
,) the bond is to be made by the executor, unto the substitute Bald. in Auth.

, or him that is appointed executor in place of him that is bound if the
condition be not observed Bald. in d. Auth.

were succeed where any dies intestate Stat. Ed. 3. an. 18. c. 19 vel forte

: likewise the legatarie must enter bond to him that is substituted unto him,
if there be no substitute, then to the collegatarie, if there be none such,
then to the executor, if there be no executor, then to the ordinary Bald. in

same do not continue.

unwilling; whether shall the condition be reputed for accomplished?

Many cases there be wherein it is Ias. in L. si quis haeredem. C. de Instit.
and sub. vbi tradita est regula non paucis ampliationibus and limitationibus
illustrata.
: other cases there be, wherein it is not sufficient once to have performed the
condition, unless there be a continuance of the performance Ias. in L. in
substitutione. ff. de vulg. and pupil. sub. vbi regula^ tradidit sex fallentijs

.

But because it would grow to an infinite matter to recite every particular
case Qua in re nimium desudasse videtur Jason. vt refert Ber. Diaz. Tract. reg.
and fall. verb. conditio reg. 110.
, it is meet to set down some general conclusions or distinctions, whereunto
and whereby al those particular cases may be reduced and decided.

First of all therefore we are to enquire the casual, arbitrarie, or mixed De
quibus supr. ead. part.. 5. and Bar. in L. 1. de Instit. and sub. C. Minsing.
and Vigl. in. pen. Instit. de haered. instit.
.

If the condition be mere casual, that is to Supr. ead. part.. 5. n. 14.
Spiegel. Lexic. verb. fortuitum.
, then it is sufficient that the same was once accomplished, though it do not
continue still in the same state L. si quis haeredem. C. de Instit. and sub.
: as for example, the d. L. si quis haeredem. cuius exemplum est. Si Titius
fuerit Consul vel Praetor, etc. cui nostru^ exemplum non est dissimile.
: now if at any time after the making of this will A.B. be proctor, whether
after the testators death or before, or whether he continue still Proctor or
not, it is not material d. L. si quis haeredem.
: yea though he were deposed from his office, it skilleth not, it is
sufficient that once he was Proctor, the condition being casual, and so thou
art to be admitted to the executorship, and may obtain the legacy, as
though A.B. were Proctor still Sichard and alij in d. L. si quis haeredem.
. So it is if the testator make thee his executor, or give thee a hundred pound
if A.B. shall be Doctor of the civil law, though afterward he be degraded
Zas. in L. in substitutione. ff. de vulg. sub. n. 11.
. Likewise if the testator does make thee his executor or give thee a hundred
pound if his daughter shall be widdowe: In this case if his daughter happen at
any time to be widow, thou may be admitted to the executorship or obtain
the legacy, albeit she do afterward take a new husband Bald. in L. fin. de
indict. vid. C. Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. legatu^. q. 53. referens ibi hanc op.
esse veram. cui concinnit Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 12. tit. 19.
.

arbitrary, that is to say, such a condition as the law esteems to be in our
power Sichard. in Rub. de Inst. and sub. C. Viglius et Minsing. in. pen.
Instit. de haered. instituend.
; then it is not sufficient that it be once Bar. in L. 2. de cond. et demon.
ff. Sichard. in L. si quis haeredem. de Instit. et sub. C. quorum opinio
communis est. ex relatione Grassi Thesaur. com. op.. legatum. q. 57. n. 3.
: As for example, the testator makes thee his executor, or gives thee a
hundred pound if thou pay to A.B. ten pound, thou paiest ten pound to A.B.
and when thou have so done, thou take it from him again, this payment is no
payment, because thou did not suffer the money to continue with him, and
therefore in this case thou art worthily repelled from being executor, or
obtaininge the legacy L. si soluturus. ff de soluc. et Angel. ibid. Sichard.
in d. L. quis haeredem. n. 6.
. So it is if the condition do include a continuance of time: as for example,
the testator makes thee his executor or gives thee a hundred pound, if thou
permit A.B. to have a way through thy ground: in this case it is not
sufficient, that thou permit him to have a way or to pass through thy ground
for a day or two, but thou must suffer him so long time as the testator has
assigned, otherwise the condition is not said to be complete Dec. et Sichard.
in d. L. si quis haeredem. de Instit. et sub. C.
. But what if the testator make thee his executor or give thee a hundred pound,
if thou give ten pound to A.B. thou of pity and co^passio^ give him ten
pound, being ignorant of this condition: whether is it sufficient that thou
did once give him ten pound? In this case the condition is not reputed for
accomplished, and therefore if thou will be executor or obtain the legacy,
thou must once again give him ten pound, as else where I have declared Supr.
ead. part.. 7. in prin. per gloss. et DD. in d. L. si quis haeredem. et Grass.
Thesaur. com. op.. legatum. q. 52.
: for where the condition is arbitrary, it must be observed preciselie Supra
ead. part.. 7.
, unless it be in such a case as it can not be iterated d. L. si quis
haerede^. et p. Sichar. ibid. n. 3.
: For example, thou art made executor or have a hundred pound bequeathed unto
thee, if thou manumit thy bo^dman, or if thou remit to A.B. ten pound which he
owes thee: in which case if thou shalt grant liberty to thy servant, or
release the said debte of ten pound, before thou know of the conditional
disposition, this act shall be accounted for an accomplishment of the
condition, because now thou can not do it again Sichard. and alij in d. L.
si quis haeredem. de Instit. and sub. C.
.

When the condition is a mixte condition, d. L. Squis haeredem.
: for example, the testator makes his daughter she marie; she marieth;
afterward her husband dies, or they are divorced by occasion of his fault:
In this case she is to be admitted to the executorship, or may obtain the
legacy, as if the marriage had not been dissolved, DD. in d. L. si quis
haeredem.
. But if the fault were the occasion of the divorce, it is more doubtful
whether the condition shall be accounted for complete to her benefit DD. in d.
L. si quis haered. quorum Bald. Sal. and Alex. in ea opinione sunt, vt conditio
non sit completa: sed Ang. Ias. Dec. and mother ni fere omnes contrarium
defendunt.
: In which case nevertheless, their opinion seems the truer and sounder, who
hold that the law does exact no more at her hands by reason of this former
condition, but that she marie, not that she should commit no fault whereby the
marriage must be dissolved Hoc tutius esse refert Jason, verius esse refert Dec.
in d. L. si quis haeredem. quia viz. Lex illa loquatur indistincte.
: and therefore having performed the condition by marriage, the divorce does
not repel her, the rather because she did not offend of purpose, to infringe
the condition Dec. in d. L. si quis haeredem. cuius opinio facilius admitti
debet, quandoquidem apud nos pro crimine solum ipsum matrimonij alias debite
riteque contracti, vinculum non dissoluatur; sed separatio tantum sit a mensa
and a thoro.
. In deed if she did marry only to obtain the executorship or legacy,
not with purpose to continue a duetifull wife, and afterward commit
adultery, whereby she is separated; the condition is not satisfied by that
marriage, and consequently she can neither be executrix nor obtain the legacy
Dec. Sichard. and alij in d. L. si quis haeredem
. But how may it be known, whether she did marie with purpose only to
obtain the benefit of the disposition, or with purpose to continue a duetifull
wife? the shortness of time betwixt the marriage and the committing of the
fault does declare, for if she marie on the one day, and commit the crime on
the next, this is a testimony that she had not a meaning to endure the yoke of
marriage Sichard. vbi supr. Arg. L. ventri. ^in. ff. de priuileg. cred.
: furthermore if the marriage were not lawful from the beginning, either by
reason of the minority of the person, or by reason of consanguinitie or
affinity, the condition is not reputed accomplished L. pen qua^do dies leg.
ced. L. haec conditio. de cond. and demon. ff. Mantic. de coniect, vlt. vol.
lib. 11. tit. 18. n. 22.
.

What if the party whom the testator makes (If she shall marie) be already
married at the time of the will making, whether by this marriage is the condition
said to be complete? If the testator were ignorant of the marriage, the
condition is said to be accomplished, otherwise not; L. si ita scriptum.. si
pater. ff. de leg. 2. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 18. n. 16.
as hereafter is more fully declared.

What shall we say to this question, the testator c. cum non stat. c.
imputari. de reg. iur. 6.
, as has been heretofore declared Supr. ead part.. 8.
. But the case being altered, and she which was unwilling before, being now
at length become willing and consenting, the question is more doubtful vt per
DD. in L. 1. de Instit. and sub. C. and per Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib.
11. tit. 18. n. 38.
: wherein very many do hold the affirmative, esteeming that the condition
being once accomplished by her refusal it is sufficient, though it do not so
endure, and that in this case, we are to respect the beginning and not the
success Bald. Sal. Alex. Sichard. in d. L. 1. G. de Instit. and sub. and
Molin. in Apostil. ad Dec. in eand. L.
. Others do hold the negative, supposinge that the condition ought not to be
accounted for accomplished, unless he that is to reap the benefit by the
performaunce thereof, do continue and persevere in readiness and willingness
to perform the same, and that the last delaie is ever hurtful Petr. Cyn.
Fulgos. and alij in d L. 1.
.

Either opinion has many authors of great authority, and albeit it may
seem, that this condition being a mixte condition, not consisting in his own
power alone on who^ it is imposed, but in hers also, that therefore beeinge
once accomplished it is sufficient, though it do not so continue: as in the
former examples of being Proctor, Doctor, wife, or widow, where the conditions
be reputed for fully performed, howsoever afterward the Proctor be
deposed, the Doctor degraded, the wife divorced, or the widdowe married.

non tame^ indistincte vt infra hoc ipso. in fin.
, and so that howsoever in this case, A.B. were at the first willinge and ready
to have accomplished the condition, and that it did not then stand by him
wherefore the same was not performed, yet afterward she consenting and he
dissenting, it is in effect, as if he had been unwilling at the beginning,
and consequently, that he is not to be admitted executor, nor to recover his
hundred pound by virtue of this disposition.

To the former objection, that is sufficient Ias. Dec. Sichard. and alij in d.
L. 1. d^ Instit. and sub. C.
in those cases: but here the condition was never in act, and so the
performaunce thereof came short of the testators desire Id quod clare mihi
constare videtur ex verbis testatoris dicentis (si duxerit filiam meam,) nec
obijcias per eum non stetisse, ex quo nunc stat. Sin adhuc vrgeas conditionem,
tunc primum pro impleta haberi, qua^do per eum non stetit. Respondeo illud plus
habere subtilitatis quam aequitatis, quippe qui non credam satisfactu^ esse
voluntati testantis vnica nuptiarum oblatione, muliere postea consentiente, ita
vt non subsecutis nuptijs legatum iure posci no^ possit.
. Wherefore as I said before, I do rather subscribe to their opinion, who do
hold that in this case the condition is no more reputed for complete in law,
then it is in fact: and consequently that he can reap no benefit thereby,
by whom it ought to have been performed Fateor tame contrariam opinionem dici
communem, test Sichardo in d. L. 1. de Instit. and sub. and quidem attenta
iuris subtilitate, eandem opinionem magis ferendam esse non prorsus nego, sed

.

And this opinion I suppose to be more agreeable to the meaning of the
testator, and therefore to be preferred Men's autem testatoris quam
diligentissime inuestiganda, and tanquam regina colenda est, vt ait Sichar. in
Rub. de testa. C.
, certain cases excepted. One case is where the executor or legatarie Socin.
in L. in testo^. el. 2. ff. de cond. and demon. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol.
lib. 11. tit. 18. n. 38.
. An other case is, when the testator remitteth a debt which is due unto him:
as for example, the testator remitteth to A.B. a hundred pound which he owes
him if he marie his daughter: A.B. is willing and offers to marie her; she
refuses, afterward she is willing: this new willingness does not hinder
the legatarie, being before delivered, and the action extinguished by her
refusal Mantic. vbi supr^.
. An other case is like unto this, when after the refusal made by the woman,
and before her repentance, he whose offer was before refused is admitted to
the executorship, and does obtain his legacy, and is possessed thereof, for
notwithstanding her repentance and new willingness, he may retain that
whereof he was possessed Mantic. vbi supra. post Socin. in d. l. in testo. el.
2. de cond. and demon. ff.
. An other case seems to be this, namely, when some special thing is
bequeathed: as for example, the testator does bequeath unto thee his white
horse, or a hundred pound lyinge in his cheste, if thou marie his daughter,
for straight way by her refusal thou have gotten a certain right in the
thing bequethed Socin. vbi supr. huc pertinent quae superius dicta sunt. ead.

. If there be any other cases wherein the affirmative has place, they are
more straung, nor easily like to happen, and therefore not so necessary to be
known.

Of diverse conditions which may seem doubtful, whether they be lawful or
unlawful, and first of those conditions, whereby the liberty of making
testamentes is hindered, how far the same are lawful, or unlawful.
1 Certain conditions whereof it may be doubted of some, whether they be
lawful or unlawful.

2 Captious conditions destroy the testament.

3 Captious conditions wherefore they be so termed.

4 Testamentes are to be made with all freedom, not only without fear of
loss, but also without hope of gain.

5 This proposition that captious dispositions are void, diversely extended.

6 The same proposition diversely limited.

7 An other kind of condition against the liberty of making a testament.

8 The testament improperly termed captious, which is referred to the will of
an other.

9 The testators will may not depend of an other man's will, and what is the
reason thereof.

10 What if he to whose will the testator did refer his own will, should
make a will in the name of the testator.

11 As an other man's soul is not my soul, so his will and testament is not my
will and testament.

12 It is lawful for the testator to refer his will to the will of an other
being joined with a fact.

13 So is it when the testator does refer his will to the limited will of an
other.

14 When is the testator said to refer his own will to an others absolute
will, and when to his limited will.

15 The declaration of the testators will may be referred to an other.

16 What if relation be made to the will of the executor or cegatarie.

17 In favor of liberty the disposition may be referred to an others will.

18 So may the disposition which is made ad pias causas.

19 He that does commit all his goods to the disposition of an other, does
not die intestate.

of making testamentes, L. illa institutio. ff. de haered. instituend.
: For the ancient lawmakers considering, that if it should be lawful for
testators to refer their wills to the wills of others, and to depend upon
them, then he on whom the testator did depend, either not doing any thing at
all, or else doing otherwise then the testator would, by that means the
testator should remain deceived, and they to whom the testator did wish
well, should be disappointed. Sichard. in L. captatorias. C. de mil. testo. n.

testament should personally depend of the testators own will, and not of the

Of those conditions whereby the liberty of marriage is restrained, viz. how
far the same be lawful or unlawful.
1 Of conditions against the liberty of marriage, some are lawful, some
unlawful.

2 Conditions against the liberty of marriage, are all unlawful, except in
certain cases.

3 The reasons wherefore the conditions against the liberty of marriage, are
unlawful.

4 The prohibition of the first marriage more odious then of the second.

5 The condition of mariyng with the arbitrament, will, or consent of another
is unlawful.

6 The reason wherefore the former condition is unlawful.

7 The condition prohibiting marriage for a short time is not unlawful.

8 The condition prohibiting marriage with some persons, is not unlawful.

9 Whether the condition prohibiting marriage have respect only to the first
marriage.

10 An occasion of doubt, whether the former conclusion be true.

11 An answer to the same doubt, distinguishing whether the conditions be
affirmative, or negative.

12 The condition prohibiting marriage in some place, is not unlawful.

13 The condition having relation to the marriage of a third person, is not
lawful, saving where that third person is of kin.

14 The condition prohibiting marriage, is not rejected where pia causa is
substituted.

15 Affirmative conditions about marriage are not rejected but in some cases.

16 Some affirmative conditions of marying, harder then the negative of not
marying.

17 The condition of marying with the advice or counsel of another, is not
unlawful.

18 The condition of marying with the consent of an other, is to be observed in
part.

19 Difference betwixt these phrases, If he do not marry, and, so long as he
does not marry.

20 The condition of not marying does not hinder restitution simply imposed.

ALbeit all those conditions whereby L. quoties. de cond. and demon. L. seruo..

altogether prohibited, but in part restrained, as in respect of time, place,
or person, they are not to be utterly rejected L. cum ita. L. hoc modo. L. sed

.

Wherefore, that we may the better know when these kind of conditions be
admitted or not, I thought it best, and the most easy way to set down a
rule, with ampliations and limitations of the same, according to the diversity
of cases, incident to that purpose.

all conditions against the liberty of marriage are unlawful Eand. reg.

mores, atque adeo de iure impossibilem esse, denique communi Doctorum calculo

; and that whenever the testator does appoint his executor, or make any
bequest upon such condition, that then the condition is void, as if it were
not written; and that he who is made executor, or to whom any legacy is given
upon such condition, may be admitted to the executorship, or may obtain the
legacy, as if the disposition had been simple L. quoties. L. sed si.. fin. L.

.

Mantic. de coniect. vl. vo. li. 11. tit. 19. in prin.
: whereunto it may be added, that howsoever virginity is commended, yet
marriage is not thereby condemned, and therefore (as I said before) if the
testator make one his executor, or give him an hundred pound, if he do not
marry, this condition is unlawful, and as if L. quoties. L. hoc modo. L. cum
ita legatum. de cond. and demon. ff.
: which thing is rather true, if the executor or legatarie were never married
before, for the prohibition of the first marriage is much more odious in law
then the second Istiusmodi siquidem conditio, si permanserit vidua, vel cast
vixerit, in ijs no^ reijcitur, in alijs secus. Auth. cui relictum. C. de

op.. legatum. q. 50. qua^uis eam non modo dura^, sed and iniquam existimauit
Peckius. Tract. de testam. coniug. lib. 1. c. 24.
: for albeit it be commonly and truly said, that the common wealth has an
interest that testaments should be executed L. Gallus.. quid si is. de lib.
and posthu. L. vel negare. quemad. testa. app. ff.
, yet the common wealth has a greater interest, that it should be thoroughly
peopled, and therefore marriage not to be prohibited L. 1. sol. matr. L. cum
ratio.. si plures. de bo^. dam. ff. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit.

And in consideration hereof, this rule is extended, that if the testator make
some person L. cum tale.. si arbitratu. d.. si Meuiae. Grauetta. consil. 1. n.
3. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 18. n. 8.
. And therefore in this case if he that is made executor, or to whom any
legacy in such sort is given, do marry contrary to the said restraint,
mentioned in the testament, he is to be admitted to the executorship, and may
obtain the legacy, as if no such condition had been expressed d.. si
arbitratu. L. turpia.. si Titiae. de leg. 1. ff. Grauetta. and Mantic. vbi

The reason of the unlawfulness of this Quam rationem communiter esse receptam
refert Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. legatum. q. 50. n. 9. post DD. in d. L.
turpia.. si Titiae.
, inequality of age, disparitie of kindred, disagreeing in manners or such like,
which, if it were suffered, would breed greater mischief, then may be in a
case of that quality tolerated or endured.

Moreover, if the testator do bequeath any legacy to a woman condicionally,
if she do not marry, willing her to restore the same to some other, if she
do marry: Albeit in this case the woman do marry, she may obtain the
legacy, neither is she bound to restore the same L. quoties. de cond. and
demon. ff. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 19. n. 4. Grass. Thesaur
com. op.. legatu^. q. 50. n. 7. 8.
unless it were the meaning of the testator not to forbid marriage, but to
grant the use of the thing bequeathed until the legatarie did marry Peckius
de testa. co^iug. lib. 1. c. 24. L. sed si. cum vir. de cond. and demon. ff.
. Other extensions there be also of this rule, but let us return to the
limitations.

L. sed si. cum vir. ff. de cond. and demon.
, as if the testator make his daughter executrix, or bequeath her a hundred
pound, if she do not marie before the age of 20. years: this condition is to
be performed Ias. in Auth. cui relictum. de indict. vid. C. Mantic. de coniect.
vlt. vol lib. 11. tit. 18. n. 8.
: Howbeit if the time of the prohibition be such, that it is very like, if she
should continue a maid during that space, that her marriage should be greatly
hindered, the condition is rejected, as being made in fraud of marriage Ias. in
d. Auth. cui. n. 3 per L. cum tale. ff. de cond. and demon. Fran. de Are.
consil. 67. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 19. n. 8.
.

L. cum ita legatum. ff. de cond. and demon. Peckius de testa coniug. lib. 1.
c. 24. n. 4.
: And therefore if at any time after thou do marry a widdowe, thou can not
be executor, nor obtain thy legacy: In so Oldrad. consil. 16. Alciat. in L.
boues. hoc sermon. de verb. sig. ff. and Tiraquel. in d.. limitac. 7.
, much more is the condition lawful, if the testator make thee his executor,
or give thee any legacy, if thou do not marie this, or that particular woman
d. L. cum ita legatu^. Mantic de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 19. n. 9.
Pecki^ de testam. coniug. lib. 1. c. 24.
, for here thou have greater liberty, and more choice, then in the former.
Where I said that the hope and interest of the executor or legatarie is
extinguished, if at any time he mary contrary to the prohibition of the
testator, whether it be the first or the second marriage, this may seem
doubtful: for that when mention is made of marriage, it is to be understood of
the first marriage only d. L. boues.. hoc sermon.
. And therefore if the testator make thee his executor, or gives thee an
hundred pound if thou marie his daughter; if thou after the making of this
will, should first marie some other woman, and after her death should
marry the testators daughter Paul. de Castr. in L. hoc genus. ff. de cond. and
demon.
: yet could thou not be executor, nor obtain the legacy: for in this
case, the testator is presumed to mean of the first marriage, not of the second
marriage Tiraquel. in d.. hoc sermon. n. 3. 4. facit L. matrimonij. ff. qui and
a quibus. ma.
. How then comes it to pass, that thou being made executor, or having any
thing bequeathed unto thee, if thou do not marry the testators daughter,
losest all thy hope and interest, whenever thou do marry her, supposing
thou had married one, two or three before. The answer is this, when the
condition Oldrad. d. consil. 16. Alciat. and Tiraquel in d.. hoc sermon. Bar.
and Paul. de Castr. in d. L. hoc genus. ff. de cond. and demon.
, the reason of the difference is, because there is greater force in the
negative then in the affirmative Pius negat negatio quam affirmat affirmatio,
inquit Paul. de Castr. in d L. hoc. genus.
.

The third limitation is, when the L. hoc modo. ff. de cond. and demon. Grass.
Thesaur. com. op.. legatu^. q. 50. Peckius. de testa. coniug. lib. 1. c. 24. n.
10.
.

The fourth limitation is, when the condition of not marrying, is not referred
to the executor or legatarie, but to some other person: as for example, the
testator makes thee his executor, or gives thee an hundred pound, if his
daughter do not marry: in this case the condition is not rejected, wherefore
thou art to expect the event thereof L. 1. C. de indict. vid. Mantic. de
coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 19. n 5.
, for if she marry thou art excluded, if she die unmarried thou art to be
admitted DD. in d. L. 1. C. de indict. vid.
. But if the testator make thee his executor, or give thee an hundred pound,
if thy daughter do not marry: this condition is unlawful L. haeres meus..
vlt. de cond. and demon. ff.
, for where the person whose marriage is prohibited, is of thy near kindred which
art made executor or legatarie, it is likely that such person will by thy
persuasions abstain from marriage, to enrich thee by the testament d.. vlt.
and ib. Bar. and Paul. de Castr.
, and therefore the law to prevent such fraud, has rejected that condition
Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 19. vbi tradit alias limitationes.
.

in pios vsus, in case the condition be not observed: as for example, the
testator does bequeath unto thee an hundred pound, if thou do not marry; and
if thou do marry, then he does will that the same be distributed amongst
the poor scholars of Oxford. In this case the condition is not rejected as
unlawful, and so if thou shall marry, thou losest thy hundred pound, and the
same is to be distributed amongst the said poor scholars Paul. de Castr. in
I. Titio.. vlt. de cond. and demon. ff. Mantic de coniect vlt. vol. lib. 11.
tit. 18. n. 9.
, the reason is, for that the law does more favor piety the^ the liberty to
marry Mantic vbi supr Imol. in d. L. Titio.. vl. Tiraquel. de priuileg, piae
causae. priu. 18.
.

is conceived affirmatively, not negatiuely: for example, the testator makes
thee his executor, or gives thee an hundred pound if thou marry his daughter
L. vter. de cond. and demon. ff. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit.
18. n. 2.
, or if thou marry a maid Peckius. Tract. de testa. coniug. lib. 1. c. 24.
, or if thou marry within a month Mantic. d. tit. 18.
, or if thou marry at London Peckius. d. c. 24. n. 5. in fin.
, for albeit in these affirmative conditions, is also included a negative, that
is to say; if thou do not marry another woman, nor at any other time, nor in
any other place: nevertheless, these conditions are not unlawful, seeing the
included negative is not universal but particular L. cum ita. L. hoc modo. ff.
de cond. and demon.
.

But if the woman appointed by the testator d. L. cum ita legatu^.
, then howsoever the condition be affirmative, yet in very truth it is a
harder condition, and more against the liberty of marriage, then this negative

from marrying any other, but thou art, as far as is in his power, enforced to

Whether the condition forbidding alienation of goods bequeathed, be lawful
or unlawful.
1 Prohibition of alienation is sometimes to be observed as lawful, sometimes
not.

2 Prohibition apparelled with a cause is lawful.

3 Naked prohibition does not bind the executor, or legatarie.

4 Whether the feoffee may be prohibited to alienate.

5 Whether the dower of lands in tail may prohibit alienation.

6 As it is lawful to prohibit alienation in favor of some persons, so in
disfauoure of others.

7 Of those causes wherewith the prohibition is said to be apparelled.

8 In what cases the executor or legatarie may alienate the thing devised,
notwithstanding the apparelled prohibition.

9 Bond ought to be put in where there is a condition prohibiting alienation.

cause whereupon this restraint is grounded.

d.. diui.
. In which case they may renounce this favor, and alienate the thing devised,
notwithstanding such single prohibition, which is rather said to be a counsel,
then a commandment Ias. in d.. diui. n. 1.
: For the law does deem it an absurd matter, that a man should be lord
and owner of a thing, and yet should not at pleasure alienate the same Ias. in

conditions.


But when the prohibition has a cause annexed, or the same is made in favor
of some other person, who is afterward to enjoy the lands; then this
condition of not alienating the same, is good and effectual in the law, as
may appear by the gifts of land in tail. For if lands be given to a man,
and to the heirs Fitzherb. Abridg. tit. condition. n. 4. Litleto^. tit.
estates upon conditions. fol. 77.
. And Alex. in d. L. filiussamilias.. diui. ff. de leg. 1. n. 1.
. In which case also concerning lands, the laws of this realm, do not
differ from the civil and ecclesiastical laws concerning goods: for
howsoever it is not lawful for the feoffer to cut off the whole power of the
feoffee, yet he may abridge or restrain some part thereof, by condition that
he shall not alienate his lands to such or such persons Brook Abridg. tit.
cond. n. 135. Litleton. tit. estates upon condition. fol. libri mei. 77.
.

The cause wherewith the prohibition is arises for the most part of the
testators affection, toward the thing bequeathed: as when the testator does
bequeath some cup of gold which was his ancestors, forbidding the executor
or legatarie to alienate the same, but to keep it for a memorial L. si in
emptione. de Minor. ff. Paul. de Castrens. in d.. diui.
: or when he does bequeath some jewel, or other ornament being the gift of the
prince Alex. and Ripa. in d.. diui.
, and for that cause does prohibit the alienation thereof; or when he does
bequeath some prize by him gotten in the wars, as a sword or an helmet, and
therefore does forbid the alienation thereof Alex. and Rip. vbi supr.
.

Which prohibition in this sort is to be observed, as well as if it were in
regard of some other person d. L. filiusfa.. diui.
, except it be in certain cases, for it is not perpetually true, that the
prohibition upon a cause, or made in respect of some person is to be observed.

The first exception therefore of this rule is, when the alienatio^ is
necessary, not voluntary, that is to say, when the rest of the testators goods
will not suffice to pay his debtes: for then it is lawful for the executor to
sell the same goods prohibited to be sold d.. diui. in fin. L. peto..
praedium. ff. de leg. 2. Ias. and Ripa. in d.. diui
.

The second, when the alienation is momentanie, or of a short time, not
perpetual, with a covenant to restore the thing alienated again Angel. in L.
voluntas. C. de fideicommiss. Ripa. in d.. diui. n. 10. vbi limitat hanc
exceptionem duobus modis.
.

The third exception is, when the thing bequeathed is in place far distant
from him to whom it is bequeathed, and who by reason thereof, cannot have any
benefit thereby, if he should not alienate the same: for then the prohibition
of alienation, being made in his favor, it seems that he may alienate the
same Bald. in L. voluntas. C. de fideicommiss.
.

The fourth is, when the alienation is made by him who is the last of the
family, in whose favor the testator did prohibit the thing bequeathed to be
alienated Ias. and Ripa. in d.. diui.
.

The fifth is, when the executor being prohibited to alienate the thing
bequeathed, except to certain persons, and the offering to sell the same unto
them, they refuse to buie it. In which case he may sell the same to others,
notwithstanding the prohibition Ias. in rep. d.. diui. n. 8. per L. qui Romae..

The sixth is, when the thing bequeathed was first sold to the person permitted
by the testator, for afterward it may be simply sold to any other Ias. in

Within what time the condition may or ought to be performed, no certain
time being limited by the testator.
1 In this question, three times, and three conditions, are to be considered.

2 Whether the condition may be performed before the making of the will.

3 When the condition is arbitrarie, the same must be performed after the death
of the testator.

4 What if the arbitrary condition be such as the same cannot be iterated.

5 What if the arbitrarie condition have relation to the time past.

6 Casual and mixed conditions may be performed before the making of the
testament, if the testator were ignorant of the performance.

7 If the testator did know of the former performance, it must be performed
again if it be possible.

8 Whether the condition may be performed during the time betwixt the making
of the testament, and the death of the testator?

9 Within what compass of time, may or ought the condition to be performed
after the death of the testator.

10 The condition being arbitrarie, it is material whether the condition be
imposed on the executor or legatarie.

11 The executor may at any time accomplish the arbitrarie condition after the
testators death.

12 Whether the ordinary may limit a certain time for performance of the
condition.

13 The legatarie must perform the arbitrarie condition, so soon as he can.

14 The reason wherefore the executor has longer time of performing an
arbitrarie condition, then the legatarie.

15 No time does prejudice the legatarie, whiles he is ignorant of the
condition.

16 If the condition be casual, it may be accomplished at any time.

17 What if the condition be extant after the death of the legatarie.

18 If the condition be mixed, it may be performed at any time.

19 What if the condition do concern marriage, whether ought it to be performed
within three years?

. xiiij.
IF we will understand within

Of the three times, the first is the time before the making of the testament:
the second is the time betwixt the making of the testament, and the death of
the testator: the third is the time after the death of the testaior L. ^i iam
facta. ff. de cond. and demon.
.

Touching the conditions we are to consider, whether the same be arbitrarie,
casual, mixed L. vnic.. sin autem. C. de cad. toll. and supra ead. part.. 5.
. For the time before the making of the testament, if any do inquire whether
within that time, the condition may be performed: It arbitrarie, that is to
say, such as does consist in his power on whom it is imposed, the same cannot
be performed but after the death of the testator L. 2. de condic. and demon.
ff. L. si quis haeredem. de instit. and sub. C.
. For example, the testator makes thee executor, or gives thee a hundred
pound, if thou will go to the Church, or if thou will give ten pound to the
poor: In this case it is not sufficient that thou did go to the Church, or
that thou did give ten pound to the poor at any time before the making
of the testament, or yet after the making of the testament, before the death of
the testator: for an arbitrarie condition must be performed after Gloss. and
DD. in d. L. si quis haeredem. and hoc etiam fieri debet, non fato aut casu,
sed animo and studio implendi conditionem, vt habet communis omnium Interpretum
sententia. test Grasso. Thesaur. com. op.. legatum. q. 57. and huc faciunt
quae superius dicta sunt ead part.. 7. in princ.
, saving in some cases. One is when the condition cannot be iterated: for then
it is sufficient that the same was performed in the life time of the testator,
even before the making of the testament L. si iam facta. L. haec conditio. ff.
de cond. and demon. Paul. de Castr. in d. L. si quis haeredem. n. 4.
: for example, the testator makes thee executor, or gives thee an hundred
pound, if thou shall remit unto A.B. the debt which he owes thee, and burn
the obligation; which thing is by thee already done: In this case it is
sufficient that thou have done it, seeing it cannot be iterated L. haec
conditio. el. 1. ff. de cond. and demon. Bar. in L. 2. de cond. and demon.
Paul. de Castr. and Sichard. in L. si quis haeredem. de instit. and sub. C.
. And this I suppose to be true, not only if the testator be ignorant of the
performance of the condition d. L. si iam and facta. and L. haec conditio. el.
1. ff. de cond. and demon. and eo loci Interpretes.
(for it is not likely that he would have imposed any condition to have been
performed, if he had known the same to have been performed before, and that
it could not be performed again) but also, if he did know the condition to
have been performed before, in which case the condition not being iterable, is
impossible, and so rejected, the disposition remaining pure and simple Grass.
Thesaur. com. op.. legatum. q. 57. in fin. per L. quae sub condition..
quoties. ff. de cond. instit.
. Another exception is, when the condition is referred to the time L. talis
institutio. de cond. instit. L. cum ad praesens. si cer. pe. ff.
. In which case it is not only sufficient, that the condition was performed
before the making of the testament, but it is necessary that it should so be,
for obteining the executorship or legacy d. L. Institutio talis.
.

But if the condition be not arbitrarie, but casual or mixed, that is to say,
either wholly without the power of the person on whom it is imposed, or partly
in his power, and partly in the power of some other Bar. in L. 1. C. de Inst.
and sub. supr. cad. part.. 5. in fin.
; the^ it is material whether the testator were ignorant of the acco^plishment
of the condition when he made his testament, or not: for if the testator, when
he made his testament, were ignorant that the condition was performed before,
the same is deemed to be sufficiently complete d. L. si iam facta. ff. de cond.
et demon. d. L. siquis haeredem. C. de instit. et sub.
. Example of the casual condition, the testator makes thee his executor, or
gives thee an hundred pound, if his ship shall return from Venice: this ship
is returned already, but the testator is ignorant thereof, at the time of
making his testament. In this case the condition is sufficiently extant, as if
the same had returned after his death L. haec conditio.. si sic. ff. de cond.
et demo^. et d. L. si quis haerede^.
. Example of the next condition: the testator does make thee his executor, or
gives thee an hundred pound, i^ thou take a wife; thou have a wife already,
but the testator did not then know so much, when he made this condition. In
this case also thou art reputed to have sufficiently accomplished the
condition Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 18. n. 16. per d. L. si
quis haeredem. et d. L. si iam facta.
.

L. si ita scriptum. ff. de leg. 2. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. tit. 18. lib.
11. n. 16.
. Howbeit, if the condition were such, that the same could not be iterated,
then it should be reputed for extant and accomplished: albeit the testator at
that time when he did impose the condition, were not ignorant of the
accomplishment thereof: For example, the testator makes thee his executor, or
gives thee an hundred pound, if thou shall be baptized, or if thou shall take
his daughter to wife: for it is sufficient, albeit the testator did know thee
to be baptized before, or that thou have taken his daughter to thy wife
before, seeing the condition cannot be iterated L. quae sub condition.
quoties. de cond. inst. L. haec conditio. el. 1. et L. si iam facta. de cond.
et demon. ff. L. si quis haeredem. de inst. et sub. C. et DD. in dictas LL.
.

that is to say, either is the condition arbitrarie; and then it is not
sufficient to perform the same, so long as the testator lives, unless it be
such a case as cannot be iterated; or that the condition does respect the
time past; or else the condition is casual, or mixed; and then it is sufficient
that it is completed whiles the testator lives, for seeing it is sufficient,
if it be performed before the making of the testament, much more if it be
performed after the making of the testament.

Concerning the third time, which is the arbitrarie, casual, or mixed, for
according to the diversity of the conditions, Law has determined diversely.

In the first case, viz. when the condition is L. si quis instituatur.. 1. de
haered. instit. ff.
: For example, the testator makes thee his executor, if thou shall give to the
poor ten pound. In this case thou may at any time during thy life
accomplish the condition, and it is of the same effect, as if thou had
performed the same immediately Gloss. Bar. et Bald. in d.. 1. Grass. Thesaur.
com. op.. legatum. q. 57. n. 2.
, unless the ordinary do appoint a certain competent time for the
performance thereof, for so he may do in this case (as hereafter is more fully
declared Infr. ead. part.. 16.
) within which time if thou do not accomplish the condition, he then may
commit the administration of the goods of the deceassed, as of Bar. Bald Paul.
de Castr. in d. L. si quis.. 1. et infr. ead. part.. 16.
. If the condition do appertain to the legatarie, then the same must be
performed so soon as the legatarie conveniently may perform the same, or else
the legacy is lost L. haec conditio. ff. de cond. et demo^. Dec. in L. 1. de
instit. et sub. C.
. For example, the testator does bequeath unto thee an hundred pound, if thou will go unto the Church, or give ten pound to the poor. In this case so soon
as thou art well able to go to the Church, or to give the ten pound after
the death of the testator, thou must perform the condition, otherwise thou
Bar. in d. L. haec conditio. Alex. in L. si insulam. n. 24. Ripa. n. 103. de
verb. ob. ff. quae opinio communiter est recepta, ait Grass. Thesaur. com. op..
legatum. q. 57. n. 2.
. The reason of the difference betwixt the executor and the legatarie in this
respect, is, because greater prejudice may grow to the executor, by
undertaking the executorship, then to the legatarie by accepting the legacy.
And therefore in equity the executor ought to have longer time, to deliberate
of the performance of the condition, and undertaking of the burden of the
executorship, then the legatarie, to whom no prejudice at all may happen, or
not so much, as to the executor Grass. vbi supr. Bar. Bald. Castr. and alij in
L. si quis.. 1. ff. de haered. instit.
. unto him, by not perfourming the condition, as otherwise it might, if he had
known thereof Bald. in L. 1. C. de Instit. and sub. n. 20.
.

In the second case, that is to say, when the condition is casual, then the
event thereof is L. intercidit. de co^d. and demon. L. fideicommissa.. sic.
fideico^miss. in sin. de leg. 3. ff.
: As for example, the testator makes thee his executor, or gives thee an
hundred pound, if his ship return from Venice. In this case whenever the
ship shall return from Venice, during the life of the executor or legatarie,
then is he to be admitted to the executorship, and may obtain the legacy, but
not before d. L. intercidit. L. v. ric.. sin autem. C. de cad. tol. Tiraquel.
de retract.. 1. gloss. 2. n. 25.
. So that if he die L. liber.. si ita de haered. instituend. L. in testo^. de
cond. and demon. ff. L. vnic.. sin autem. C. de cad. tol. Zas. in L. si december.
ff. de verb. oblig.
; unless some legacy be left unto the Prince, who if he die before the
condition be extant, yet is the same due to his successors, in whose time the
condition is extant L. quod principi. ff. de leg. 2.
, or unless it be the will and meaning of the testator, that the same be
transmitted: for the testator, if he will may make the same transmissible,
which otherwise is not transmissible L. in conditionibus.. 1. ff. de cond. and
demo^. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 10.
.

In the third case, that is to say, when the Ias. in L. 2. de Instit. and sub.
C.
. But if the testator make thee his executor, or give thee very many be of
this opinion, that thou ought to marry within three years Bar. in L. 2..
ad filiorum. C. qua^do and quibus quarta pars. Ias. Sichard. and alij in L. 2.
C. de Instit. and sub.
. Others are of a contrary opinion, and that it is sufficient to marry at
any time, either within three years or after Paul. de Castr. in d. L. 2.
Mantic. de coniect vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 18. n. 23.
. In which contrariety of opinions, I suppose that if the executor be
appointed upon condition, if he marry, that then he may at any time
accomplish the same, not only within three years, but after Paul. de Castr.
ind. L. 2. Grass. Thesaur. com. op. legatum. q. 46. n. 18.
. But if a legacy be given upon condition, if the legatarie marie, then it
is the common opinion of the writers, that the legatarie must be married within
three years, or else the condition is said to be deficient, and so is the
legacy lost Bar. Ias. Dec. Sichar. and alij, in d. L. 2. quorum opinio
communis est, inquit Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. legatum. q. 46. n. 18.
. And albeit the other opinion is said to be truer, that the condition is
sufficiently accomplished by marying after three years Mantic. de coniect.
vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 18. n. 23. Grass. vbi supr.
, yet the judge may not easily depart from the common opinion: for whatsoever
is affirmed for the truth of the singular opinion; yet that is presumed to be
the truer opinion, which is more commonly received Corasius. Trac. com. op.
lib. 2. cas. 14.
. The reason of the difference wherefore the legatarie is excluded rather then
the executor, if he do not marry within three years (as is before showed)
namely, for that the executor otherwise is subject to more peril then the
legatarie Vt supra in pluribus.
.

Of the understanding of this condition, viz. If he die without issue.
1 Manifold questions by occasion of this condition, if he die without issue.

2 Whether he be said to die without issue, whose issue is natural, but not
lawful.

3 What if the father and mother do afterward marie together.

4 When the issue is lawful, not natural, whether he be said to die without
issue?

5 What if the child were got by another man before marriage.

6 If another have to do with the wife besides her husband, yet the child shall
be deemed the husbands.

7 Diverse extensions of this conclusion.

8 What if the child be like the adulterer.

9 How commes it to pass, that the child is sometimes like unto another then
him which did beget it.

10 In some cases the husband shall not be judged the father of the child
begotten during marriage.

11 Whether shall the child be the former or the second husbands, when it is
uncertain whether of them did beget him.

12 Whether he be said to die without issue, who had children, but not at
his death.

13 Difference betwixt this condition, If he die without issue, and this, If
he have no issue.

14 Whether that father is to be deemed to die without issue, whose child is
unborn when he dies.

15 Whether he be deemed to have died without issue, whose child dies so soon
as it is borne.

16 If the child be heard to cry, the father shall be tenant by the courtesy.

17 What if the child were not heard to cry.

18 What if the issue be borne dead, or dies as it is borne.

19 What if a monster be borne, whethr shall the parents be judged to have
died without issue.

20 What if the child in the mothers womb, being made executor, she be
delivered of diverse children at one birth, whether shall every of them be
executors?

21 What is to be observed in legacies, where more are borne at one birth.

. xv.
(If he die without issue) so there is none that does minister more questions
(although some of them be not altogether so difficult) which thing that it may
the better appear, let us first suppose that the testator does make thee his
executor, or does bequeath unto thee an hundred pound, if he die without
issue. This case does minister all these questions, What if the testator have
issue natural, but not lawful? Or what if he have issue lawful, but not
natural? What if he have issue both natural and lawful, but the same dies
before the father? Or what if he beget his wife with child, and then die
before the child be borne? Or what if the child die before it be borne?
Whether shall the testator be judged to die without isse; yea, or no? All
these and many more like questions, may be demanded by reason of that
condition (If he die without issue) whereunto I shall answer in order as they
be propounded: presupposing that to have issue, is to have a child, or
children: and to die without issue is to die with out any child.

such should not inherit Per c. 1. etc. tanta. qui filij sunt le git. extr..

: and they all instanted the Lords temporal and Barons then assembled in
Parliament that they would consent, that all they that were borne before
matrimony, should be legitimate, as well as they that were borne within
matrimony, concerning the succession of inheritance, for as much as the
Church accepted such as legitimate. But they all with one voice answered, that
they would not change the laws of this realm, which hitherto had been used
and observed Merton. c. 9. an. 20. H. 3.

When the issue is lawful, not natural: By Bracton. de consuet. Angl lib. 2.

was delivered of a child as black as pitch, like unto a Moore or Ethiopian:
and hereupon being accused of adultery, she was acquitted and absolved, for
that by the opinion of the best learned in physic and philosophy, the same
did so come to pass by reason of the picture of a black boie, or little Nigro,
which did hang in the bedchamber at the time of the co^ceptio^. Like unto this
is that credible history of another woman in the time of Charles the fourth,
Emperor and king of Boemia, who because she had too much regard to the picture
of Saint John clothed in a Camels skin, which did hang at the beds feet
during the conception, she brought forth a child all rough, covered with
hair like unto a Bear Coras. in annotac super quodam Arresto Tholoss. fol.

a dancing devil, as soon as the play was ended, ran home to his wife in
his devils attire: and being moved in spirit, catched his wife hastily in his
arms, and must needs etc. in that habit, saying he would beget a devil;
and so it came to pass, that at her childs birth she was delivered of a
deuillish monster, which as soon as it was borne, began to leap and dance
like to the father. Which examples (with diverse other like experiments) being
made notorious, many women (that they might bring forth beautiful children)
have gotten beautiful pictures, and fixed the same nigh to their beds, and
have in deed oftentimes brought forth children like unto those pictures, in
the sight whereof they were formerlie most delighted Plutarch. de placitis.

same is not seldom represented in the child Gloss. in L. quaeret aliquis. de

being otherwise a perfect child.

neither is that contrary where I said before, that by the laws of this
realm, if a man take to wife a single woman great with child by an other man,
then he which married her shall be the father of the child, albeit she were
delivered the next day after the marriage solemnized: For there it is possible
for the husband to have begotten the child: here impossible d. L. filium. quo
etia^ tendit quod Bractonus Iurisconsultus Anglus, non minus peritus, qua^
antiquus scriptum reliquit. Legitimus (inquit) and haeres iudicabitur, qui
nascitur ab vxore, dum tamen praesumi possit, quod maritus potuit ipsum
genuisse.
. Now the law does often presuppose or allow that for true which is false,
because it may be true Bar. Angl. and alij, in L. si is qui pro emptore ff. de
vsucap. Menoch. de praesump. lib. 1. q. 8.
: but the law does never presuppose or feign that thing to be which is
impossible so to be, for that were unreasonable, and against nature which
directs art Bar. in d. L. si is qui. n. 22. Alciat. de praesump. in princ.
. Again, in that case he is worthily the father of another bastard, because
he when he is free, yet willingly takes her with all her faults, whom he
knows to be another whore: But here an honest man is greatly beguiled by
her to whom he is already tied, and therefore less worthy to be further
afflicted Afflictio afflicto non est infligenda. Bar. in L. 2. ff. de no. op.
nun. Bald. in L. praecibus. C. de impub. and al. sub.
. But is it not manifest that many have succeeded in the inheritance as lawful
and natural children of those persons, who neither were principal, neither
accessarie, nor any way privy to the begetting either of a leg or an arm, no
not so much as of the little finger of that issue? Indeed no marvel, when
there is not due proof of impossibility Nam cum par militet in vtroque casu
ratio, cur no^ idem ius? cur quaeso magis fauendum est absenti, ne habeatur pro
patre illius quem genuit alter, quam qui mor bo, vel senio confectus generare
nequeat? Quod si dixeris difficilius probari generandi impotentiam, quam
absentiam: Attamen probata hac impotentia, eadem tunc prorsus manet hinc, ac
inde ratio.
, the defect is not in law, but in proof L. duo sunt Titij. ff. de testa.

, which proof is said to be the chariot wherein the Judge does ride toward
his sentence Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib 4. tit. 11. n. 43.

: Yet when the testator speaks of issue, it is not likely that he did mean
of such issue, which is not as well natural as lawful Mantic. de coniect. vlt.
vol. lib. 11. tit. 8. n. 2. per L. vlt. de his qui vaen. aetatis.

Diverse other limitations there be of this former rule, showing that the
child is not to be ascribed to the husband, but to the adulterer Quas videre
est apud Gabr. lib. 1. com. concl. 14. Mascard. de probac. con. 788.

, and does altogether cohabit with the adulterer, and especially if then also
the child be borne blind, or lame, or be like unto the adulterer, for then
it seems that the adulterer shall be judged to be the childs father,
unless it be proved that the husband had free and often access unto the
mother: but because I doubt of the truth of these limitations, I dare not
deliver them for current: nevertheless in testamentes, the will and meaning of
the testator is to be regarded, and so the husband is to be judged to have had
issue, or not to have had issue accordingly Mantic. vbi supra. Paul. de Castr.
consil. 30. vol. 1.
. What if the wife be married to another husband very shortly after the death of
her former husband, and after her second marriage be delivered of a child,
whose issue shall this be, the former or the second husbands? If the wife were
great, or apparently with child at the death of her former husband, then there
is no question, but that the issue is to be ascribed to the former husband DD.
in L. Gallus. ff. de lib. and posthu. Terms of law. verb. bastardy. Kitchen. in
tit. descent. fol. 108.
. But if she were not apparently with child, so that by possibility of
nature, it might be the child, either of the former or the second husband, for
that perhapps she is delivered within eight or nine months after the death of
her former husband; yet not before the seventh month next after her second
marriage, then the question is much more doubtful De qua. Bar. Bald. Alex. Ias.

cupiat, legate Ias. in d. L. Gallus. and Jacob. de Beluis. in quadam
disputatione, quam habet in L. 1. de bon. poss. secundum Tabul.

do hold that the former husband ought to be judged the father Multos in hac

: some that the second husband Anto. Vacca. in L. 7 ff. de stat. hom. post

: Others that both Angel. in L. duo. de haered. instituend. ff.
: and others again that neither Iac. de Beluis. in d. disputac.
is to be deemed the father of the issue. Some say that the mother is to be
credited Alciat. d. praesump. 37. n. 15. per L. etiam. ff. de probac.
, which of them is the father: and some say that it is in the child to elect
and choose Alex. in d. L. Gallus. n. 14. verse. hoc tame^ dictum. and cum eo
consentit Berry Iusticiarius Angliae, de quo Brook. tit. bastardie. n. 18. in

whether of them he will for his father: Others are of this mind, that he
shall be deemed the father by whom the child may receive the greater benefit

: And others, that he shall be the father, unto whom the child is more like in
favor, complexion and proportion of body Coras. lib. 2. Miscel. c. 22.
: Many do leave it to the discretion of the circumspect Judge, who is not tied
to any one opinion alone, but according to the variety and probability of
circumstances (together with the advice of Physicians, Midwiues, and especially
such as be skillful in astrology Apostil. ad Alex. in d. L. Gallus. vbi

. Finally, by the laws of this realm, at least in cases of succession of
land, it seems that the second husband shall be the father of this child
Tract. de repub. Ang. lib. 3. c. 6. Terms of law. verb. bastardy. Kitchen.
tit. descent. fol. 108
, because it being certain that the child is borne during the marying and
cohabitation betwixt the second husband and the mother, and uncertain whether
he were begotten before, it were very hard and dangerous to adiudge him to
be another man's child, rather then the second husbands, who by possibility of
nature may be his father Apostil. ad Bar. in d. L. Gallus.
, and to whom it is to be imputed, that he adventured so soon upon an other

executor, for this word (then) is said to signify extremity of time, so
that it is not sufficient that the testator had issue in the mean time d.. si

the mothers womb at such time as the father dies; If we would in this case
know, whether that man is to be judged to have died without issue, we must
consider whether it be for the benefit of the child that the father should
be accounted to have died without issue, or not: For howsoever the rule be,
that he is not said to die without issue, whose wife is with child at his
death L. si quis praegnante^. de reg. iur. ff. L. iubemus.. si quis autem. C.

. Wherefore, if the testator make thee his executor, or give thee an hundred
pound, if he die without issue, after which will made, he dies, leaving his
wife with child: In this case he is reputed to die without issue; and so thou
art to be admitted to the executorship, and may recover thy legacy Mantic.

But in very truth (if we look a little nearer unto the cause) the time of
another death is not only uncertain, in respect of the question when, but
also in some respect of the question whether L. haeres meus. ff. de cond. and
demon. and Bald. in d. L.
: for who is certain whether that the other shall die before the legatarie? and
this I suppose to be the principal cause, wherefore the legacy which is given,
or is to be performed after the death of another, is reputed to be
conditional: namely, because it is uncertain whether that time shall happen
during the life of the Bald. in d. L. haeres. Cuiac. lib. 18. obseruac. cap. 1.
Mantic. de co^iec. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 20. n. 4
. For if the question be only when the time shall happen, and not whether it
may happen during the life of the legatarie, then the legacy in respect of
transmission, is said to be pure and not conditional d. L. haeres meus. and
ibi Bald. cum Paul. de Castr.
: As for example, the testator gives thee an hundred pound to be paid the
day before thy death: here the uncertainty is only when the time shall
happen, not whether it shall happen during thy life: wherefore in this case,
after thy death, thy executors or administrators may recover the legacy d. L.
haeres meus. L. 4. ff. quando dies. leg. ced.
, and that without distinction, whether the uncertainty be joined to the
substance of the legacy; as I give thee an hundred pound the day before thy
death; or whether it be joined to the execution of the legacy; as I give thee
an hundred pound to be paid the day before thy death d. L. haeres. Et licet
in illius legis exemplo incertitudo videri possit adiungi praestationi legati,
and non substantiae tamen cum ratio illius legis sit generalis, and in vtroque
casu militet, nempe quia dies non potest non cedere viuente legatario, vis
legis non est per vnicum exemplum angustanda
.

Wherefore where it is said, that when a legacy is given after an uncertain
time, if the legatarie die in the mean while, his executors or administrators
are excluded from demanding the same legacy, albeit the uncertainty be about
this question when; that conclusion has diverse limitations. The first
limitation or restraint is, in case also it be uncertain whether the same
shall happen during Bald. in d. L. haeres. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib.
11. tit. 20. n. 4. Cuiac. lib. 18. obseruac. c. 1. Ias. in L. si cui.. hoc

the life time of the legatarie: otherwise, if it must needs happen during the
life of the legatarie, then the executors or administrators of the legatarie
are not excluded, although it be uncertain when it shall happen d. L. haeres
meus. ff. de cond. and demon.
. Another limitation is, when L. in conditionibus. ff. de cond. and demon.

What if the testator does bequeath some a certain age, whether (if the
legatarie, or that other person die before that age) may the executors, or
administrators of the legatarie obtain the legacy De hac q. vberrime scripsit
Vasq. de succes. progress. lib. 3. c. 29. and generaliter DD. in L. si cui..
hoc autem. ff. de leg. 1.
? This question I suppose is thus to be answered.

If the time be joined to the substance of L. si Titio ff. Quando dies. leg.
ced. d. L. si cui.. hoc autem. de leg. 1.
: For example, the testator does give thee an hundred pound, when thou shall
be of the age of 21. years, thou die before that time, thy executors or
administrators cannot obtain the hundred pound DD. in d.. hoc autem.
: except in certain cases, whereof the first case is, when Bar. in d.. hoc
autem.
: For example, the testator does will or charge his executor to pay unto thee
an hundred pound, when he shall be of the age of xxi. years, before which
time the executor dies. In this case (by the opinion of diverse Par. Angel.
Paul. de Castr. and Lancel. Dec. in d.. hoc autem. per L. libertis quos.. ab
haeredibus. ff. de Alimen. and cibar. leg.
) thou may recover thy legacy against the executor of that executor dying at
such time, as the former executor, if he had lived, should have accomplished
the age prescribed in the testament: Their reason is, because the testator is
presumed to bear greater love to his own executor, on whom he has bestowed
the residue of his goods, then to the executors executor, whom peradventure he
did not know Bar. and Lancel. Dec. in d.. hoc autem.
: Wherefore seeing the testator charged his own executor whom he more loved,
the rather then is he presumed to charge his executors executor whom he less
loved Arg. a mayor. ad mi.
. Howbeit if the testator charge his executor with the payment of the legacy
by this word if, as if the testator command his executor to pay unto thee an
hundred pound, if he shall accomplish the age of xxi. years: Here the
legacy is condicionall, and therefore if the executor die in the mean while,
the legacy dies together with the executor Bar. in d.. hoc auto^. per L. si
seruus. ff. de stat. lib.
. And so it is if the executor be charged with the payment of the legacy
after he be of such age L. fideicommissaria. el. 1.. etiam. ff. de
fidecommiss. Lib. and Bar. cum Paul. de Castr. and Lancel. Dec. in d.. hoc
autem. ff. de leg. 1.
: Nay more (contrary to that which is said before) although the testator do
charge his executor with the payment of the legacy by this word when, as in
the first example; even there also by the received opinion of the more part,
the legacy is concluded to be condicionall Din. Sal. Imol. Raph. Cuma: Alex.
Aret. and Ias. in d.. hoc. autem. quorum opinio communis est contra Bar. and
eius sequaces, ait Ias. vbi supra.
: and therefore if the executor die before that age, the legacy cannot be
recovered against the executor of the executor deceased L. intercidit. ff. de
co^. and demon. ff. L. vnic.. sin autem. C. de cad. ^ol.
, no more then where it is given after his executor have accomplished such an
age, for albeit this word (after) does import a more full perfection of time
then does this word when Ias. Alex. and alij. in d.. hoc autem.
, yet they differ not in making the disposition conditional: for that is done
as well by the word when, as by the word after Ita contra Bar. sentiunt
Salic. Imol. Alex. and Ias. ac Mother. in d.. hoc autem.
. What if the executor being charged with the payment of the legacy, when, or
after he have accomplished a certain age, the legatarie himself do die, the
executor still living, whether may the executors or administrators of the
legatarie deceased recover the thing bequeathed of the executor then living,
after he have accomplished the age limited in the testament? It seems that he
may Paul. de Castr. in d.. hoc autem. in lect. pad. verse. and multo fortius.
, because the condition is here extant: notwithstanding because it is
concluded, that the legacy in this case is condicional, therefore howsoever the
condition do afterward come to pass, yet was the legacy extinguished by the
death of the legatarie, the condition then depending L. vnic.. sin autem. C. de
cad. tol. L. intercidit. ff. de cond. and demo^.
, and so cannot be recovered by his executors or administrators, unless it be
proved (for it is not presumed Nam cum praesumitur testator magis diligere
ipsum legatarium quam eius executorem, licet velit dare primo, non sequitur
quod dabit secundo. Bar. in d.. hoc autem.
) that the testator did mean the contrary L. in conditionibus. ff. de cond.
et demon. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 20. n. 8. Bar. in d.. hoc
autem. in fin.
.

The second case is in favor of liberty or freedom from bondage L. si ita
scriptum. ff. de manumiss. testa.
: For example; the testator does manumit his villeine, when his son shall
attain to the age of xxi. years. In which case albeit his son do not
attain to that age, yet shall the villeine be free, at such time as he should
have attained unto that age, if he had lived d. L. si ita scriptum. et DD. in
d.. hoc autem.
.

The third case is, when any legacy is left to some godly use, for then
also the legacy may be recovered, notwithstanding the death of that person, to
whose age the testator made relation Vasq. de success. progress. lib. 3.. 29.
n. 5. in fin. vbi conclusionem hanc varijs confirmat medijs.
.

The fourth case is, when the time tends to the dissolution of the legacy:
For example, the testator does give thee ten pound yearly, until his son
do attain to the age of xxi. years: In which case, if his son die in the
mean time, thou may obtain the legacy of ten pound yearly, until such
time as the testators son should have attained to that age, if he had lived

But if the time of the age be not joined to the substance of the legacy, but
to the execution or performance of the same: then the legatarie dying in the
mean time, his executors or administrators may recover the same when the time
is expired, wherein the legatarie if he had lived, should have accomplished

1 It is lawful to appoint an executor either universally or perticularly.

2 The universal executor may enter to all the testators goods and cattels,
and therefore chargeable with payment of all his debts.

3 The particular executor may meddle with no more then is allotted unto him,
and therefore not charged but according to his portion.

the rest of the goods of the testator deceased not administered by the executor
Brook Abridg. tit. admistr. n. 45. and tit. executor. n. 149.

conditionally; that is to say, if he which is instituted executor in the first
degree, will not, nor cannot be executor Odofred. and Fulgo. in d. L. post

: wherefore he that was first instituted lawfully, undertaking the
executorship, can not be said to be unwilling or unable; and so the condition
expireth, and is become deficient, without the accomplishment whereof, that is
to say, unless the executor in the first degree will not or cannot be
executor, the substitute cannot claim any thing Constat alias a Iasone,

received Bar. in d. L. 1. de vulg. sub. n. 49. cuius opinio communis est,
testimonio Grass. Thesaur. co^. op.. substitutio. q. 15.
: likewise if he that is first instituted, do delay to take upon him the
executorship, by the space of thirty years, he is to be excluded, and the
substitute to be received Ias. in L. quamdiu. de acquir. haered. ff. qua^

ordinary do assign a certain time, to take or refuse the executorship Vide

: likewise, if he that is first instituted cannot be executor, the substitute
being appointed upon this condition, if the former will not be executor,
nevertheless the substitute is to be admitted, as if the former executor had
refused Bar. in d. L. 1. ff. de vulg. sub. and post eum Zas. in d. Tract. de

substituted in the case not expressed, if he had remembered the same, as well as
in the case expressed; there the substitute is to be admitted, as if the same
case had been expressed Bar. and Ias. vbi supra.

instituted executors, will not, or can not be executor, the portion of that
executor shall not be equally distributed amongst the substituted executors, but

: the cause of the difference (as most do think) is the force of this word
and, which word being most commonly used, and almost necessary, where soever
the testator does substitute diverse persons, by their several proper names,
the nature and force thereof is such, as it does make equal distribution Paul.

; without the which the substitution shall be proportionable to the
institution: insomuch that if the testator do substitute diverse by their
proper names, without that word and; as if the testator say, I substitute the
two John's at Noke. In this case, the testators being instituted unequally in
the first degree, the substitutes are to succeed unequally likewise Iidem

When the substitution is made by both names jointly, we are to consider,
whether the names appellatiue, or the proper names have the first place in the
disposition: For if the appellatiue go before, then the substitutes are to be
admitted, as if their proper names were not at all expressed, that is to say,
according to the proportion of the institution: but if the proper names enjoy
the first place, then the substitutes are admitted equally, notwithstanding

executors.

18 If the testator do bequeath an hundred pound to the child in the mothers
womb, and the mother is delivered of two or three, whether are each of them to
have an hundred pound, or but one hundred amongst them.

19 What if the testator make his wife and the child in her womb executors,
willing that if it be a man child, he to have two parts of the residue of
his goods, and his wife but one: and if it be a woman child, then his wife to
have two parts, and his daughter but one: Admit now, the mother have both a
son and a daughter at one birth, how is the goods to be distributed?

Fifthly, either one person may be appointed. and vnum. Instit. de haered.

: for to appoint executors in that sort, were an argument that the testator
were not of perfect mind, and memory Porcius in d.. and vnum.
: Besides that it is impossible Idem Porcius. ibid.
, for all to execute, and therefore a void assignation, at least in effect

residue of his goods, albeit he do not declare which poor, what Church, or
which kinnesfolkes, nevertheless the disposition is not void, as elsewhere is
declared Infra 7. part.. 8. vide Dyer. fol. 160.
.

When the testator does make diverse c. religiosa.. sanc. de testa. lib. 6.
, which conclusion is diversely both extended and limited.

The first extension is, that albeit the testator and so to be admitted, in
case the son cannot or will not be executor Gloss. and Bar. in L. Gallus..
quida^ recte. ff. de lib. and posthu. Grass. Thesaur. com. op. Institutio. q.
20. n. 6.
, yet by the laws and customs of this realm it is otherwise, and both are to
be admitted alike Quippe cessante causa. and ratione iuris ciuilis nimirum
instituendi necessitate, cessat and ipsius legis effectus. c. cum cessante. de
app. extra.
.

The second extension is, that although the executors be appointed
alternatiuely, or disiunctiuely: As for example, the testator makes A.B. or
C.D. his executors: In this case both the persons are to be admitted executors
L. quida^. C. de verb. sig. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 4. tit. 3. n. 19.
, and this word, or, in favor of testaments is taken for and d. L. quidam.
and ibi Bar. and Ias.
, and so it is in effect, as if the testator had said, I make A.B. and C.D. my
executos, saving in certain cases else where expressed Infr. 7. part.. 9. and
ibi tres extant limitationes.
.

The third extension is, that where there be diverse executors, the action
commenced by them, or against them, ought to be commenced in all their names,
and not in the name of some of them only Io. de Athon. in legate in.
libertatem. de execu. testa. Brook Abridg. tit. exec. n 117. Intellige in
executoribus haereditate^ adeuntibus, alias indistincte in vtroque casu non est

.

cannot be executor c. religiosa.. sane. de testa. lib. 6.
: the second is when he will not undertake the executorship d.. sane. and ibi
Domi. and Phil. Franc.
. For the better understanding of the which two limitations, First, concerning
the former of them, we are to note, whether the impediment be perpetual or
temporal.

If the impediment be perpetual, because perhaps the coexecutor is dead, or
perhaps such a person as is utterly incapable of an executorship, then he that
is living and able to execute, may be admitted to the executorship;
notwithstanding the impediment of the coexecutor d.. sane. and ibidem Franc. et
alij.
, unless the testator did will expressly, that the one should not execute
without the other Eod.. sane. in sin.
: otherwise if two be appointed executors, and d.. sane. et ibi gloss.
; nor in suits or actions Brook Abridg. tit. executor. n. 92. 160.
. And if the executor of the executor, have any goods or cattels in his hand,
which did belong to the first testator, the executor of the same testator
suruiuing, may have an actio^ against the executor of the executor for the same
Brook, tit. executor. n. 99.
: In so much that if the executor suruiuing, Brook. tit. executor. n. 149.
: and the ordinary in this case may commit the administration of the goods of
the suruiuing executor, who died afterward intestate, to the widow, or to
the next of his kin: and may also commit the administration of the goods of
the former testator not before administered, to the widdowe, or next of kin to
the same testator eod. n. 149.
. And if the executor of the executor who Brook Abridg. tit. exec. n. 29. 99.
.

If the impediment be not perpetual, but then we are to consider, whether the
same be like to endure for a long time or but for a short time: If the
impediment be like to continue long, for that perhaps the coexecutor is beyond
the seas, or in some by place far distant Io. And. et Phil. Franc. in d..
sane.
, or for that peradventure the coexecutor is yet unborn, or but a babe (for
such persons may be named executors Vt infr. part. 5.. 1.
:) then the other executor is to be admitted in the mean time d.. sane. et
DD. ibid.
, for the law would not that men's testaments or last wills should be
deferred, but with all convenient speed executed and performed Franc. in d..
sane.
: But if the impediment be but of a short time, then the one executor is to
expect his fellow, and is not in the mean time to be admitted alone to the
executorship Idem Francus post Io. And. in d.. sane.
.

refuse so to do, then is the other executor to be admitted alone, and may
execute the will, or commence any suite, or be sued alone, as if none other had
been named executor d. c. religiosa.. sane. de testa. lib. 6.
* which conclusion is true, if the executor refusing do still persevere in his
unwillingness: Brook Abridg. tit. exec. n. 38. and n. 117.
. And if he release any debt due to the testator, the release is as sufficient,
as if he had never refused Brook. d. tit. n. 117. and n. 177.
. To these two limitations may a third be added, whereby one executor may sue
or be sued, without the other coexecutor: namely, when no exception is made Io.
de Athon. in legatin. libertatem. de execut. testam.
: hereunto also may be added a fourth limitation, that is to say, when any one
of the executors, does sell some of the testators goods for a sum of money,
for then that executor which sold the goods, may himself alone sue for the
money due for the same goods Brook Abridg. tit. exec. n. 66.
.

Furthermore it is to be noted, that when the testator does make diverse
executors, if any Brook. tit. exec. n 98.
: for one executor can not sue another Infr. part. 6.. 3.
. Howbeit if the testator make diverse Brook. d. tit. execut. n. 104.
. Likewise, if the testator do bequeath unto all his executors the residue of
his goods, the same ought to be equally distributed amongst them: In which
case I suppose the office of the ordinary to whom they are accomptable, is of
great authority, if one of them seek to defraude another c. tua nos. de
testam. extr. Brook Abridg. tit. account. n. 8.
.

But what if the testator make many executors, the rest of my clear goods:
whether in this case ought the father to have as much as all his children, or
whether ought every child to have as much as the father: I suppose that in
this case the residue of the deaths part ought to be divided into two parts,
and that the father ought to have as much as all the children Ias. in L. fin.
de impub. and al. sub. C. Dec. consil. 236. and cons. 254
: for it is delivered for a rule, that where diverse persons be comprehended
under one name collectiue, with another third person, then all they which be
included under that one name, do represent one only person Ias. in d. L. fin.
Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 4. tit. 9. quem operepretium crit videre.
. Of which rule, nevertheless there be diverse exceptions: One is, when the
testator wills the said goods to be equally divided amongst them L.
interdum. and ibi Paul. de Castr. ff. de haered. instit. Dec. consil. 597.
. Another is, when the children were not borne at the time of the making of the
testament Ias. in d. L. fin. per L. quida^.. si tibi de reb. dub. ff.
. The third, and that is general, is when the testator means that every
person shall have a like portion Ias. in eand. L. fin. que^ velim videas, nam
ibi tradidit regulam septe^ limitationibus dotata^.
: for in those cases the rule ^oth not hold, but distribution is to be made
according to the number of the persons: that is to say, if there be three
persons, then the residue of the deaths part is to be divided into three
parts, and if there be four persons, then into four parts, and if there be
mo, then into mo parts, every part equal for every person.

Ias. in L. placet. ff. de lib. and posthu. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib.

: And as they are all to be admitted to the executorship, so are they all to
enjoy the legacy. And therefore if the testator say, I do bequeath an hundred
pound to the child in the mothers womb, and if she does bear two or three
children, the legacy is to be divided amongst them Paul. de Castr. in L. qui
filiabus.. 1. ff. de leg. 1.
. But if the testator say, if my wife shall bring forth any child, I give to
the same an hundred pound: and she bring forth two or three children; in this
case every child may obtain an hundred pound, if the testators goods do
suffice to satisfy the same d. L. qui filiabus.. 1. and DD. ibid.
, unless it be proved, that it was the testators meaning that they should
have no more but an hundred pound amongst them Text. in d.. 1.
.

What shall we say to this question, The testator L. si ita. ff. de lib. and
posthu.
: that is to say, the son shall have twice so much as the mother, and the
mother twice so much as the daughter: for example, the residue of the testators
goods arising to seven score pounds, the son ought to have fourscore
pounds, the mother forty, and the daughter twenty: so the mother has double
so much as the daughter, and the son has double so much as the mother.

worthy kind Addic. ad Bar. in d. L. quaeritur.

Of those things which do appertain to the appearance of the testament.
1 Every testament is to be proved by witnesses, or by writing.

2 Two witnesses needful, and two sufficient.

3 What if the witnesses be not free from all exception, whether does the
number supply the defect.

4 Sometimes one witness is sufficient.

5 Every one may be a witness which is not forbidden.

6 Three especial causes, which do minister exceptions against witnesses.

7 Who are excluded for their dishonestie.

8 All malefactors are not repelled from witnessing.

9 Who are excluded for want of judgment, and how long.

10 Who are excluded for affection, and how far.

11 Whether a legatarie may be a witness.

12 Whether a woman may be a witness.

13 Whether a poor man may be a witness.

Having spoken of the general internal form, common to every testament, that
is to say, of the making of an executor: now let us return to the general
external form, that is to say, the form whereby every testament may lawfully
appear.

Wherefore that wills and testamentes witness, or by writing Mascard. Tract.
de probac. verb. testamentum. alioquin praesumi quemlibet ab intestato
decessisse co^firmat, Mantic. de con. iect. vlt. vol. lib. 2 tit. 1.
.

Of proof by writing, it follows afterward, in the handling of the
particular form of written testaments Infr. ead. part.. 25.
.

Concerning proof to be made by witnesses, two things are especially to be
examined: First, how many witnesses are required for the full proof of a
testament or last will: Secondly, what manner persons may be received for
witnesses.

For the number, By the laws and customs Ius autem civil exigit septem.. sed
cum paulatim. and. fin. Instit. de testa. ordin.
, and again two are sufficient Lindw. in c. statutu^. verb. probatis. de testa
lib. 3. prouinc. constitu. Cant. Peckius. in c. priuilegium. de reg. iur. 6. n.
7.
: So that as it is not necessary to have any more then two; so it is vain to
have no more but one Ias. in L. cunctos. C. de summa Trinitate. Hyppol. Singul.
102.
: For the better understanding of the which twofold conclusion:

First, where it is affirmed that two witnesses be sufficient: that is to be
understood, in case the same two witnesses be without cause of exception c.
relatum. el. 1. de testa. extr. Lindw. in d. c. statutum. verb. probatis.
Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 6 tit. 3. n 5. 6.
: but if they be not lawful witnesses, two alone are not sufficient for the
proof of a last will d. c. ^elatum. etc. cu^ esses. de t^sta. ext. and ibi DD.
, at the least where the same is to be proved in form of law.

Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 6. tit. 3. n 8.
: But when the exceptions whereunto the witnesses be subject, are great and
heinous; as the exception of perjury, which does utterly extinguishe all the
credit of the deposition Mascard. de probac. verb. periurus. Ampl. 1. Alciat.
de praesump. reg. 2. praesump. 10.

of the witnesses, as of those that be perpetually mad, or have no
understanding; or when the defect is not in the person, but in the deposition

; in these and like cases the number does not supply the defect, but the
testimony of them all is as the testimony of none Vide eund. Gabr. d. concl.

.

is as none; yet such is the power and authority of the testator, that he may
ordain that that one witness shall make a full proof, as if the testator
commit somewhat in secret unto him (being loath perhaps that any other should
know thereof) and wills in his life, that that person alone shall be
credited for the declaration of his will: In this case that one person alone is
sufficient to prove the contents of the last will and testamente of the person
deceased L. Theopom. ff. de dote praeleg. Olden. de probac. fol. 286. b.
.

For the second question; that is to say, what manner of persons are to be
received for witnesses: This may be delivered for a rule, that whatsoever L.
1.. 1. ff. de testib.
. This rule is short; but if we should descend to the exceptions, and show in
particular, what persons are in this case forbidden to bear testimony by the
civil and ecclesiastical laws, we should find it a matter of such
discourse, as the same should far exceed the quantity of this small volume:
for there be many volumes of this argument only Id quod plusquam manifestum
est per illum lib. qui inscribitur Tractatus de testibus probandis, vel
reprobandis. Var. authorum. etc.
. Besides it is a matter wherein very much is left to the discreet
consideration of the circumspect Judge L. 3.. 1. de testibus. ff.
, so that it is very hard also, to prescribe any certainty in this behalf
Bar. Bald. and alij ind. L. 3.. 1.
: only I will remember three special omni exceptione maiores: the first is
dishonestie in manners: the second is want of judgment or understanding: the
third is affection more to the one party then to the other Has causas veluti

cannot write, that then he name him before those witnesses L. iubemus. L. cum

writing, or by any other means: yet if that writing were but a draught, or
preparation to the testament, and not the testament it self, it is without

Words and sentences, are not required L. quoniam indignu^. C. de testa.

; and therefore if the writer by error omit some words, whereby the sense is
imperfect: As for example, the Notarie does write thus (I make my wife my, of
this my last will and testament) leaving out this word (executur:) in this
case the error of the writer ought not to prevail against the truth of the
testament L. errore. C. de testa.
: for the law presumes that more was spoken, though less was written d. L.

errauerat, vel quod testator omnia nuncupauerat, cum lex ipsa sit loco
probationis. Sich. in d. L. errore. Attamen necesse est probare mulierem istam
esse testatoris vxorem, qua^ vult esse suam executricem. Ias. in d L. in sin.
: much less ought it to be prejudicial to the testament, where in steed of
the words omitted, other words of the same sense to such purpose are used and
expressed L. quontam. C. de testam.
: For example, suppose that in the testament it is written, that the testator
does bequeath such lands to such person, to have and to hold to him and to
his assigns for evermore. How soever in this devise there is not any mention
of heirs, without which word an estate of inheritance cannot pass, by any
deed or gift made whiles a man yet lives; yet because in testaments, the will
and the intent of the testator is preferred before formal or prescript words,
an estate of inheritance does thereby pass, as if he had made express
mention of his heirs Supr. ead. part.. 4.
. Other examples to the same effect are extant in other places of this book,
which to repeat were superfluous.

Concerning the last question, viz. whether witnesses of a written will; this
is the answer, that if it be certain and undoubted, that the testament is
written or subscribed with the testators own hand: In this case the testimony
of witnesses is not necessary Auth. quod sine. C. de testa. and DD. ibid. Io.

the testator; in this case the testimony of witnesses is necessary, to

writings of the known hand of the testator, and so prove the will to be

testament Sichard. in d. Auth. quod sine. Alex. d. consil. 76. vol. 3. Molin.

case where it is doubtful whether the testator did write or subscribe the
testament, if the witnesses do depose that they did see the testator write or
subscribe the testament, and being learned know the same to be his hand

IN the making of a Nuncupatiue will or testament, this is chiefly to be
observed, that the testator do name his executor, and declare his mind by
words of mouth, without writing before witnesses. fin. Instit. de testa.

And although in written testaments it be also required, that the words and

The difference betwixt obscurity and By obscurity, the hearer is made like
to him which walks in a dark place, not knowing where the way lies, whether
on the right hand, or on the left; before him, or behind him; or whether he be
in the way, or out of the way: By ambiguitie, the hearer is made like unto him,
who walking in the light, meets with two or three ways, and knows not
which way to take, nor which of those ways leads to that place whereunto he
ought to go Zafius in L. veteribus. ff. de pactis. Spiegel. and Cagnol. vbi

lawyers are not so favorable to their clients, and therefore if it were but to
avoid long and costly suites, it is meet that the testator utter his mind,
as plainly and certainly as he can.

COncerning the forms of testaments privileged or not privileged, or of
other kinds of wills, as of codicils, or of gifts in case of death, I
refer the reader to those places where special mention is made of every of
them, and of their differences of forms Supra 1. part.. 5. 6. 7. etc.
.

And chiefly concerning the forms of legacies, I wish the reader to peruse the
manifold forms of making an executor: For as I have often said Supra ead.
part.. 3. and. 4. n. 18. cum seq.
, by understanding after how many sorts an executor may be appointed, it is
an easy matter to collect how diversely a legacy may be left also.

. j.
IN the fifth principal part of this Testamentarie treatise is declared, what
persons may be appointed executors, and are capable of a legacy, and what
persons are incapable of an executorship or legacy.

Wherein forasmuch as the law does give liberty to the testator to appoint
whom he will to be his executor Tit. de haered. instit. lib. 2. Instituc. in
princ. Benedict. de Capra. Tract. regul. and fall. verb. executor.
, and likewise to give legacies to whom he will, certain persons excepted.
legari. Instit. de lega.
: This may be delivered for a rule, that every person may be an executor, and
is capable of a legacy saving such as are forbidden Minsing. in d. tit. de
haered. instit. in prin. pract. Petr. de Ferrar. in forma libelli, ad reddend.
ration. Tutel.. an ^^ecutores. n. 1.
. Now what persons these be which are forbidden, shall straight way be showed,
after the view of the greatness of the testators liberty in appointing his
executors.

First, it is to be understood that this liberty of the testator is so large
and ample, that albeit the testator have children of his own, naturally and
lawfully begotten, yet by the laws and customs of this realm, he may
appoint others to be his executors; secretly omitting, or openly excluding his
own children Bract de consuetud. and leg. Angl. lib. 2. c. 26. Tract. de
repub. Angl. lib. 3. c. 7. vnde perspicuum est, nullum fere vsum apud nos
manner huiusmodi titulorum iuris ciuilis, viz. de exhaeredac. liberorum. lib.

de in offic. test. ff. Instit. and C. vna cum pluribus alijs eiusdem farinae,
cum titulis, tu^ legibus.
.

Secondly, the testator has liberty to appoint executors, not only those
which be free, but also bondmen, or villeines Lib. 2. Instit. tit. de haered.
instituend. in prin. Litleton. tit. villenage. fol. ^0. Brook Abridg. tit.
villein. n. 68. Et licet iure civilly seruus institui quidem potest, non
executor, vt per Bald. in L. id quod C. de episcopis and cler. n. 3. Tamen iure
quo nos vtimur, institui possunt serui nostrates executores, vt per Litleton
and Brook. vbi supra. Quinimo eodem iure civilly seruus constitui potest nudus
executor. Io. de Canib. Tract. de exec. vlt. volunt. part. 1. q. 3. n. 47.
, either his own villeine, or the villeine of another d. tit. de haered.
instit. in prin.
. And if the testator do make his own villeine executor, he does manumit, or
deliver his villeine from bondage Io. de Platea. in d. tit. in prin.
: And if another villeine be made executor, such villeine may as executor
have action against his own Lord, in case he were indebted to the testator
Litleto^. tit. villenage fol. 40. Brook. tit. villein n. 68.
, because he shall not recover the debt to his own use, but to the use of the
testator Litleton. vbi supra. and sic nota quod no^ obtinet ius civil, quo
seruus alienus institutus acquirat domino.. alienus. Instit. de haered. instit.
.

Thirdly, the testator has liberty to appoint his executors, not only
laymen, but Clearkes also Imo etiam religiosos obtenta licentia Fitzh. tit.
execut. n. 47. Brook. eod. tit. n. 63. 77.
.

Fourthly, the testator may make executors, not only men, but also women
Couar. in c. tua. de testa. extr. Et est communis opinio. Peckius de testa.
coni^g. lib. 1 c. 20.
, either single or married Peckius. d. c. 20. Fitzh. and Brook. d. tit. executor.
.

Fifthly, the testator has power to appoint executors, not only persons of full
age, but also infants Brook Abridg. tit. executor. n. 115. tit. couerture. n.
56.
: and the act done by the infant as executor, as the releasing of the debt due
to the testator, or the selling or distributing of the testators goods, is
said to be sufficient Brook. vbi supra. and sic non recipitur iuris ciuilis
disciplina, qua minor 17. annis non admittitur executor.
in law. And here note, by the laws of this realm, every one is accounted
infant until he be xxi. years old Doct. and Stud. lib. 1. c. 21. lib. 2. c.
28.
. But if the infant be so young that he has no discretion (for it is not only
lawful to make such an one executor, but also the child in the mothers womb,
and unborn at the death of the testator L. placet. ff. de lib. and posthu.
quae lex etsi loquatur de haeredis institutione, idem tamen iuris vel in
executoris co^stitutione, passim ab Anglis obseruari notorie co^stat, quicquid
dixerit ius civil.
) In that case the ordinary, or other to whom the approbation of the testament
appertains, after the birth of the child does commit the execution of the
will to the tutor of the child, for the childs behoof, until he be able to
execute the same himself, the which tutor has authority to deal as executor
until the child be able to undertake the executorship Quod sine vlla
contradictione saepissime obseruatur, salte^ infra prouinciam Eborac.
.

Sixthly, it is lawful for the testator not only to appoint his known
friends and acquaintance his executors, but also strangers, and such persons
as he did never see. fin. Instit. de haered. instituend. L. extraneum. C. de
testa. vide infra ead. part.. vlt. and intellige vt ibi.
.

Finally, the testator may appoint one person alone, or many. and vnum Instit.
de haered. instituend.
: many I say, several, or many representing one body, as a College, a
City, an university L. haereditatis. C. de haered. instit. Minsing. in d..
and vnum. Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. Institutio. q. 20.
.

After this view of the greatness of the power of the testator in making
executors, let us return to the restraint of the testators liberty, and show
what persons are forbidden to be executors, or to reap any commodity, by a
testament or last will.

Of an Heretic.
1 An Heretic cannot be executor.

2 Whether an Heretic may be executor in a military testament.

3 What if the Heretic do reclaim his heresy.

. ij.
AN Heretic can not be executor; neither is he capable of a legacy L.
Ariani. C. de haeretic. Sichard. in Rub. de haered. instit. C. n. 5. Minsing.
in tit. de haered. instit. lib. 2. Insti^uc. in prin.
: and so odious is the crime of heresy, that albeit the party be not yet
condemned of heresy: nevertheless perseuering in his heresy, he is not to
be admitted Vasq. de success. progress. lib. 1.. 2. n. 20.
, no not in a military testament L. vlt. C. de haereticis
, howsoever a soldier has more liberty in making an executor then another
Supra. 1. part.. 14.
.

And albeit he that is named executor, do repent and reclaim his heresy, yet
being an heretic, either at the time of the making of the testament, or at the
time of the death of the testator, or at the time when he undertakes the
executorship, he is excluded. in extraneis. Instit de haered. qual. and
differentia.
.

For this is perpetual, that if any person be incapable, either when the
testament is made, or when the testator dies, or when he takes upon him the
executorship, it is as if he were always incapable d.. in extraneis. L. si
alienum.. 1. ff. de haered. instituend. Sichar. in Rub. de testa. C. in fin
Grass. Thesaur. co^. op.. Institutio. q. 28.
: but it hinders not if he be not incapable at other times d. in extraneis.
L. sed and si.. solemus. ff. de haered. instit.
; neither does it hinder the legatarie though he be incapable of the legacy at
the making of the testament, so that he be capable thereof at the time of the
testators death Bar. in L. non oportet. ff. de leg. 2. Peckius Tract. de testa.
coniug. lib. 4. c. 31. Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. Institutio. q. 28.
, (as appears more at large hereafter Infr. part. 7.. 19.
) the reason of the difference is, because the legacy depends of another
act; that is to say, of the testament, from whence it receives his power and
virtue, but the testament or appointment of the executor does not depend of
an other act, whereby it may receive either life or strength Peckius. d. c. ^1.
.

Of an Apostata.
. iij.
AN Apostata also is incapable of an executorship, or legacy L. hi qui
secundum. C. de Aposta.
: what an Apostata is, and how many kinds of Apostasy there be, I have else
where declared Supra. 2.. 15.
.

That which is here spoken, is meant of Apostasy, properly so called, that is
to say, of back-starting from the Christian faith Bar. in Rub. de Aposta. C.
: to whom I might join also Anabaptists, for they are also incapable of
executorships and legacies L. vlt. de sacr. baptis. reit. C. Minsin. in d. tit.
de haered. instit. lib. 2. Instit. in prin.
.

Of traitors and felons.
. iiii.
Whosoever is co^uicted of treason, or felony, as he cannot make a testament
or last will, as is before confirmed Supra. 12. 13. part. 2.
, no more is he capable of any thing disposed by testament or last will Nam
cum sit damnatus ad mortem naturalem, mortuo aequiparatur, and sic non potest
institui Bar. in L. qui vltimo. ff. de paenis. and est com. op. Grass..
Institutio. q. 5. Vasq. de success progress. lib. 1.. 2. n. 13.
.

Of him that is outlavved.
. v.
HE that is outlawed, is out of the protection of the prince, and all his goods
are forfeited, and is destitute of all the aid of the laws of this realm
Supra part. 2.. 21.
: And therefore so long as he stands in that case, he is not to be admitted
to the executorship, nor can sue for his legacy Fitzh Abridg. tit. adm^str. n.
3. Sed non existimo vtlegatum penitus incapacem reddi, vtpote quem relegato
verius quam deportato, comparandum putem, (nam and relegati bona quandoque
publicantur:) sed quia non habet personam standi in iudicio, vtlegatus no^ est
audiendus in iudicio durante vtlegatione.
, except it be in such cases as he may make his testament, whereof mention is
made before Supra d. part. 2.. 21.
.

Of an excommunicate person.
. vi.
ALbeit an excommunicate person may be appointed executor, and is capable of a
legacy Phil. Franc. in Rub. de testa. lib. 6. n. 32. quae sententia communiter
approbatur, ait Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. Institutio. q. 4. Bald. in L. id quod
pauperibus. C. de episcopis and cler. n. 6
, yet so long as he stands in the sentence of excommunication, he is not to
be admitted by the ordinary, nor can commence any suite for his legacy c.
intelleximus. de iudic. c. post cessione^. de probac. extr.
.

Of Bastards.
1 Three sorts of Bastardes.

2 Incestuous and adulterous Bastardes, are incapable of all testamentarie
benefit.

3 Diverse extensions of this former conclusion.

4 Diverse limitations of the same conclusion.

5 Difference betwixt the laws Ecclesiastical and the civil law, about the
alimentation or nourishment of children, begotten in adultery and incest.

6 Of the laws and statutes of this realm, concerning Bastards.

7 Of Bastardes begotten betwixt single persons.

8 Whether the legacy left unto the Bastard, be presumed to be left for his
alimentation or relief.

. vij.
OF Bastards or children begotten out of matrimony, there be diverse sorts:
some are begotten and borne in simple fornication, that is to say, of carnal
copulation betwixt single persons, such as at the time of the conception or
birth of the child, may be married together Couar. Tract. de matrimonio. 2.
part. c. 8.. 4. Iul. Clar. lib. 5.. fornicatio.
. Some are begotten in adultery; that is to say, of such parents, as both, or
the one of them being married to some other at the time of the birth and
conception of the child, cannot then marie together themselves Couar. in d. c.
8.. 5. Iul. Clar.. adulterium.
. Some again are begotten in incest; that is to say, betwixt such persons as
are prohibited to marry, by reason of Consanguinitie or Affinity Couar. in d.
c. 8.. 5. and 6. Iul. Clar. incestus.
.

Bastards begotten and borne in adultery or incest, are not capable of any
benefit by the testament or last will of their incestuous or adulterous parents
Auth. ex complexu. C. de incest. nup. and DD ibid. Couar. de sponsal. 2. part.
c. 8.. ^. Grass. Thesaur. com. op. Institutio. q. 7.
, which conclusion is accompa^ied with no small train of ampliatio^s and
limitatio^s Petr. Duen. Tract. reg. and fall. verb. filius. vbi tradit regulam
14. ampliat. and 11. limitac. illustratam.
, of which company these are not the meanest.

The first ampliation is, that albeit the incestuous or adulterous father do
name an other person to be his executor, to whom he gives the residue of his
goods, willing him to restore the same goods to his incestuous and adulterous
child: this disposition is void in respect of the Bastard Barth. Caepol.
Cautela. 38. verb. quinta.
: (neither is the executor bound to restore the same, but may retain the same
to himself Couar. de sponsal. 2. part. 5. n. 7.
) for whereof any person is not capable directly or by himself, he is not
capable thereof, indirectly or by an other Duen. verb. silius. reg. 366.
: yet I deny not but that the executor may of his own liberality give any
goods to the bastard, though not as the gift or goods of the father Caepol.
vbi supra. Io. Dilect. de art testa^di. tit. 1. cautela 14. n. 8. Couar. vbi
supra.
.

The second ampliatio^ is, that albeit the father should appoint his incestuous
or adulterous child his executor, willing him to bestow his goods on such a
person, who of likelihoode would never demand the same: as if he should will
his executor to give his goods to the Emperor, or to the Turk, if he should
in person come into England to receive the same; this is but a fraudulent
cautele, whereby the executor might have some color still to retain the same
in his own hands Alex. in L. cogi.. hi qui solidi. ad Trebel. ff. Caepol. d.
cautela. 38. Io. Dilect. de art testa^di. d. cautela 14.
: And therefore by reason of this fraud the disposition is void, at least so
far as it does respect the benefit of the executor Bald. co^sil. 399. vol.
2. Imol. in L. in tempus, de haered. instit. ff. Alex. Dilect. and Caepol. vbi
supra.
.

The third ampliation is, that even he which is begotten and borne in
adultery, much more he which is begotten and borne in incest, is not only
incapable in respect of his fathers testament, but is also excluded from all
testamentarie benefit by his mother Couar. Epitom. despousal. 2. part. c. 8.
n. 15.
.

The fourth ampliation is, that the disposition is void, ipso iure, which is
made in favor or for the benefit of incestuous or adulterous bastardes Duen.
d. reg. 366. am. pliac. 4.
.

The fifth ampliation is, that although the incestuous or adulterous bastard, be
possessed of the thing to him bequeathed; yet he cannot retain or prescribe
the same by that title Bald. in L. id quod pauperibus. C. de episcopis and
cler. per gloss. in L. nemo. ff. de vsucap Due^. d. reg. 366. ampl. 5
.

The sixth ampliation is, that the adulterous, and especially the incestuous
bastard is excluded, not only by the civil and ecclesiastical laws, but
also by the law of God Augustine vt habet 35 q. 7. c. quid est. Duen. d reg.
ampliac. 2.
; but whether this ampliation be true or not, I leave to the consideration of
the reverent divines. Diverse other ampliations also there be of this
conclusion De quibus Duen. d. reg. 366. Barth. Caepol. cautela. 38. and Io.
Dilect. cautela. 14.
, which I omit, because they seem to repugne the laws of this realm. Now to
the limitations.

The limitations of the former conclusion are these: First these incestuous and
adulterous bastards may be executors unto any other person, saving unto their
natural parents, and are likewise capable of any legacy, or devise
bequeathed unto them by any other, saving by their own parents Gloss. in
Authe^. quib. mod. na. effic fin.. fin. Clar. testm^ q. 31. n. 4. Panor. in c.
cum haberet. De eo qui dux. in matrimo. qua^ pol. extr.
; even unto their incestuous or adulterous brethren, they may be executors,
or receive any other testamentarie benefit from them Duen. verb. filius. reg.
366. limit. 10. Afflict. decis. 96.
.

The second limitation is, when they are appointed nude Executors Simo de
Praetis. de Interp. vlt. vol. lib. 5. fol. 17. n. 27. Nec obstat quod dicitur
per incapacem nihil posse capi. quia attento iure Can. spurius etiam
incestuosus non est om^ino incapax, vtpote, cui alimenta licitum est
relinquere. Duen. d. reg. 366. limitac 9.
, that is to say, when they do not reap any commodity by the testament Io.
de Athon. in legatin. libertatem. de executor. test.
, for then they may be executors even to their own natural parents.

Thirdly, by the laws ecclesiastical they are also capable of so much of that
which is bequeathed unto them by their incestuous and adulterous parents, as
will suffice for their competent alimentation or relief c. cum haberet. de eo
qui dux. in vx. quam poll. per adult.
: that is to say, for their food, clothing, lodging, and other meet and
convenient necessaries L. legatis. ff. de alimen. leg. Caetera quae ad
disciplinam pertinent, legato alimentoru^ non co^tinentur, nisi aliud sensisse
testatore^ probetur. L. nisi. eod. tit.
, according to the wealth and ability of the parents d. c. cum haberet. in
sin. sed neque pro necessitate tantum (vt volunt quidam) sed etia^ ad
decentiam, constituenda sunt alimenta, si modo sacultates suppetant. Gab. lib.
6. com. conclus. tit. de alimen. concl. 1. n. 31.
. And although the civil law in detestation of this heinous sin of incest
and adultery, did deprive this incestuous and adulterous issue, of the hope of
all testamentarie benefit, though it were left for, and in the name of
alimentation, or needful relief d. Auth. ex co^plexu. C. de incest. nup.
, the rather by this mean to restrain the unbridled lusts of some, and to
preserve the chastity of others L. isti quidem. ff. de eo quod met. cause. in
fin. and. fin. Instit. de noxal. action.
: Nevertheless, forasmuch as nature has taught all creatures to provide for
their young, so that the very brute beasts have a natural care to bring up
whatsoever they bring forth Cic. lib. 1. offic. L. 1.. 1. ff. de Justice. and
iur.
: Seeing also in equity the poor infants ought not to be punished (at least
not to perish for want of food, by occasion of the fathers fault, whereof
they are altogether faultlesse Deutro. c. 24. verse. 16. Ezech. c. 18. verse. 20.
L. Sancimus. C. de paenis. L. si paena. eod. tit. did. 56. c nasci.
:) Therefore the ecclesiastical law, whereby not only adulterous Text. in d.
c. cum haberet.
, but incestuous Dec. in c. in praesentia. de probac. extr. n. 39. Gabr. vbi
supra. n. 5. quae opinio communis est contra Bald. in d. Auth. ex complexu.
issue also is made capable of so much as is sufficient for needful and
convenient sustentation, has prevailed against the rigor of the civil law,
and is to be observed especially in the ecclesiastical Court Idem iuris est in
terris imperij gloss. and Panor. in d. c. cum haberet. Bar. in ^. Auth. ex
complexu. Decis. Neap. 164. n. 2. Dec. vbi supra. Duen. verb. filius. reg. 367.
, as more agreeable to nature, equity, and humanity. And in this respect the
laws and statutes of this realm, in providing as well for the convenient
relief and keeping of poor and miserable children, begotten and born out of
lawful matrimony, at the charges of the reputed father or mother Stat. Eliz.
an. 18. c. 3.
, (without distinction whether such infantes were begotten in incest and
adultery, or fornication Vbi enim lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguere
debemus. L. de precio. ff. de pub. in rem. action.
;) as for the punishment of the mother and reputed father of such unlawful
issue, are worthily commended, although in respect of the next limitation
following, they may seem not altogether so worthy commendation.

The fourth limitation is grounded in the laws of this realm, which do
permit every man, both by deed made and executed during their lives Perkins.
tit. graunts. fol. 11. Bract. lib. 2. c. 7.
, and also by their last wills and testaments to be executed after their
deaths Perkins. tit. devise. fol. 98.
, to give and to devise unto any their bastards without distinction, all their
lands, tenements, or hereditaments, without restraint, at the least more then
will suffice for their sustentation, and much more then they are worthy of.
Which thing cannot but redounde to the great prejudice of right heirs,
considering the danger whereunto lawful children are subject, and which they
do many times sustain, through forcible ^latteries of vile dissembling
harlots, no less void of all modesty, then full fraught with all kind of
subtlety, with whose sweet poison and pleasant sting many men are so charmed
and inchaunted Videas c. 5. Proverb. Salom.
, that they have neither power to hearken to the just petitions of a virtuous
wife, praying and craving for her children, nor grace to deny the unjust
demands of a vicious and a shameless whore, prating and grating for her
bastardes; never remembering that when Sara said to Abraham: Cast out this bond
woman and her son, for the son of this bond woman shall not be heir with
my son Isaak. Abraham by the commandment of God hearkened to the voice of
Sara Genesis c. 19.
, never once regarding (that which diverse have diligently noted;) that the
brood of bastardes are commonly infected with the leprosy of the Sires disease

The fifth limitation is in the bastardes of kings and princes, for a king may

will deuisable he does give or bequeath unto him Boer. Decis. 127 n. 17.

them his executors Ias. in L. haereditas. C. de his quibus, vt indig. n 7. and

preferment in marriage: for this is accounted all one, as if he did bequeath it
unto her for her alimentation Panor. in d. c. cu^ haberet. n. 5. Bar. in d.

) after the marriage the child is borne: In this case the child is not only
capable of any testamentarie benefit, but is reputed a lawful child, and
not a bastard d. c. tanta vis. and DD. ibidem.
, as heretofore has been disputed more fully Supr. part. 4.. 15.
.

Concerning those bastards which are begotten of single persons, such (I mean)
as may lawfully marry together, then in case the mother were a maid, or an
honest widow, immediately before such unlawful copulation and co^ception of
the child: This kind of fornication is termed Stuprum L. inter liberos. L.
stuprum ff. de adul.
, and this kind of bastard seems to be in the same case as if he had been
begotten in adultery.

If the mother were an harlot before the conception of the child, howsoever by
the civil law such a bastard is not incapable of any testame^tarie benefit
Couar. de sponsal. 2. part. c. 8.. 5. n. 15. 16 17.
; yet forasmuch as by the laws ecclesiastical c. Nemo. 32. q. 4. Panor. in
Rub. de adul. extra.
and statutes of this realm Stat. Eliz. an. 18. c. 13.
, such copulation is condemned as unlawful, and to be punished as ungodly: I
suppose that this kind of bastard is no more capable of an executorship or
legacy, then if the mother had been honest before Videas Couar. in d.. 5.
, especially if the mother were a common harlot, the testator nevertheless
esteeming her to be clear from pollution with any other, and himself only
to be the undoubted father of the child, whom he does make his executor, or
to whom he does bequeath any legacy by the name of his child, when as
indeed he is not the certain father of the child, the mother having
prostituted her self to the filthiness of others also. For in this case even
by the civil law, the Bastard cannot be executor, nor obtain the legacy
Bald. in L. quisquis ad L. Iul. C. de adult. Grass. Thesaur. com. op..
Institutio. q. 7. n. 10. and infr. part. 7.. 5.
, if not by occasion of the fathers crime, yet by reason of the testators
error and folly, who of all likelihood would never have made that child
executor, nor have showed himself so good a father if he had known the bad
conditions of the mother. Where it is said that the parents may bequeath so
much to their bastardes as will suffice for their alimentation or relief, what
kind of Bastardes soever they be without distinction: It may be demanded
not impertinently, nor unprofitably, What if the testator do simply bequeath
a sum of money or some other thing to his unlawful child, not making any
mention that he does bequeath the same for the childs relief or
alimentation: Whether in this case is it to be presumed that the father did
mean it for the childs alimentation or no: but if he did so mean, the
legacy is good, otherwise it is void. Briefly, howsoever in this matter al
men are not of one mind, I do rather subscribe to their opinion, who do hold
the affirmative Aymo. Grauetta co^sil. 219. n. 8.

Of a libeller.

HE that is condemned for a famous libell is intestable, both actiuely and

Of usurers, Sodomites, and others.
1 Manifest usurers and Sodomites, can neither make a testament, nor reap any
benefit by another testament.

2 Whosoever is forbidden to make a testament by reason of some crime, the same
person is incapable of any benefit by the testament of another.

AS manifest usurers, Sodomites, and other criminous persons, are forbidden to
make testaments themselves, or to dispose their goods by their last wills (as
is before at large declared Supr. part. 2.. 15. 16. 17. 18.
;) so are they forbidden to reap any such benefit by the testament of others:
for this is a common received conclusion, that he that cannot make a testament
or last will, by reason of some crime by him committed, the same person is
incapable of any legacy of goods, disposed by the testament or last will of
another Gloss. in L. is cui ff. de testa. Soarez. lib. rec. Sen. verb. testm^.

6 The office of an executor testamentarie.

. i.
Now follows the sixth principal part of this Treatise, wherein I promised
to set forth the office or duty of an executor, I mean of an executor
Testamentarie: that is to say, of him that is appointed by the testator for the
performance of the will.

three kinds of executors, or persons which have to deal with the execution
of dead men's wills, and disposition of their goods Specul. de Instr. edit..
nunc vero aliqua. in prin.
, every of which have their several offices. The first has his authority
from the law, the second from the Ordinary, the third from the testator De

, and that not of late time (as some have lately diuined, or rather dreamed)
but ever since Christianity was first received, and established by imperial
authority, or very shortly after: nor within this realm of England only,
where the bishops to whom the approbation of testaments apperteine Lindw. in d.

time, and so many ages, that (if I be not deceived) there is not any memory
or ancient record to the contrary Lindw. in d. c. accilit, qui etsi antiquus

ille Iustiniani codex, in quo leges istae inter alias inseruntur.
, this office and charge of executing the aforesaid testaments and last wills
has been imposed upon the reverend Bishops: in the sincerity of whose
consciences all Christian laws and namely the law of this land, has reposed
greater confidence then in other lay people, about the performance of dead
men's wills Perkins in tit. de testamentis, fol. 94.
. Hence it is, that every Bishop is called Ordinary, as if other Judges were
in this behalf incompetent or extraordinary Ordinarius vero dicitur, qui lege,
vel consuetudine, vel principis beneficio iurisdictionem vniuersaliter exercet.
DD. in L. more de iur. om^. iudic.
: Hence also is it that the Bishop is called Executor legitimus, Legal
executor, because he only is appointed executor by law, where no executor is
appointed by the testator Specul. in d.. nunc vero aliqua de Instr. edit. Io.

: For when the executor named in the testament, does refuse to be, or cannot
be executor; or when no executor is named in the will; it is lawful for the
Bishop or Ordinary to commit administration Stat. Ed. 3. an. 31. c. 21 and
stat. H. 8. an. 21. c. 5.
, and to annex the will to the letters of administration Brook Abridg. tit.

testator Brook Abridg. tit. devise. n. 35. stat. Ed. 3. an. 31. c. 11.

, because he is given or assigned by the Ordinary, to whom originallie and by
law this execution does appertain: But with us he is usually called
Administrator Stat. Ed. 3. an. 31. c. 21. and stat. H. 8. an. 21. c. 5.
, because he is the Ordinaries deputy, or as it were his steward or bailife,
to deal and to administer in stead of the Ordinary; and in that respect the
Ordinary may call this his administrator to an account Stat. Ed. 3. an. 31. c.

any other man may revoke his attorney Brook. tit adm^str. n. 3. and n. 33.

Concerning the office of him that is appointed executor by law, that is to

3 If the executor being cited will not appear, the Ordinary may commit the
administration of the goods of the deceased.

administration.

were better to accept or to refuse the executorship.

2 The first thing to be inquired in this case concerning the testator.

3 Of the authority and charge of the executor.

4 The executor may not meddle with the lands, tenements or hereditame^ts of
the testator, but the heir.

5 The heir has not to deal with the goods and cattels of the testator, but
the executor.

6 The testator may give power to his executor to sell his lands for payment of
his debts, or other purpose.

7 What if some of the executors named do refuse, whether may the rest sell the
lands according to the testament.

8 Whether the executor of him that had lands in see simple, fee tail, or for
term of life, may recover the rents, fee fermes, or other arrerages against
the tenant which ought to have paid the same in the life of the testator.

9 The second thing to be required concerning the testator.

10 Of the authority and charge of the executor of an executor.

11 Whether diverse being assigned executors, whereof some be dead, the
executor of the executor deceased may be joined in action with the executor
suruiuing.

12 Of the authority and charge of the executor of an Administrator.

13 What is to be considered about the last will of the testator.

14 Whether the executor may convert the residue to his own use.

15 Whether he that is named executor, shall lease his legacy if he do refuse

statutes of this realm Stat. H. 8. an. 21. c. 4.

well before the making of that statute, as after made, or to be made by him or
them only of the same executors that so does accept, or has accepted or taken
upon him or the^, any such cure or administration of any such will and
testament, shall be as good and effectual in law, as if all the residue of
the same executors, named in the said testament, so refusing the
administration of the same testament, had joined with him or them in making of
the bargain and sale of such lands, tenements, or other hereditaments, so
willed to be sold by the executors of any such testator, which before that
time had made or declared, or that after should make or declare any will of any
such lands, tenements, or other hereditaments after his decease to be sold by
his executors, as may appear by the statute in that behalf made. Howbeit it
is provided, that the said statute shall not extend to give power and
authority to any executor or executors at any time after, to bargain, or
to put to sale, any lands, tenements, and hereditaments, by virtue and
authority of any will or testament, made before the said statute, otherwise

As for rents due to the testator by the order of the common law of this realm
Vide stat. H. 8. an. 32* c. 37.
, the executors or administrators of tenants in fee simple, tenantes in fee
tail, and tenants for term of life, of rent services, rent charges, rent
secks and fee fermes, have no remedy to recover such arrerages of the said
rentes or fee fermes, as were due unto those testators in their lives, nor yet
the heirs of any such testator, nor any person having the reuersion of his
estate after his decease, may distraine or have any lawful action to leave any
such arrerages of rentes or fee fermes, due unto him in his life, by reason
whereof the tenantes of the demaine of such lands, tenements, or hereditaments,
out of the which such rents were due and paiable, who of right ought to pay
their rents and fermes, at such days and terms as they were due, did many
times keep hold, and retain such arrerages in their own hands, so that the
executors and administrators of the persons, to whom any such rents or fee
ferms were due, could not have or come by the arrerages of the same, toward
the payment of the debts, and performance of the will of the said testator. For
remedy whereof, it is enacted by the statutes of this realm, as follows,
viz. that the executors and administrators of every such person or persons,
unto whom any such rents or fee fermes, is or shall be due, and not paid at
the time of his death, shall and may have an action of debt for all such
arrerages against the tenant, or tenants, that ought to have paid the said
rent or fee ferme, so being behind in the life time of their testator, or
against the executors and administrators of the said tenants. And also
furthermore, it shall be lawful to every such executor or administrator of
any such person or persons, to whom such rent or fee ferme is or shall be due,
and not paid at the time of his death, as is aforesaid, to distraine for the
arrerages of all such rentes and fee fermes, upon the lands, tenements, or
other hereditaments, which were charged with the payment of such rents or fee
fermes, and chargeable to the distress of the said testator, so long as the
said lands, tenements, or hereditaments, continue, remain, and be in the
seasin or possession of the said tenant in demaine, who ought immediately to
have paid the said rent or fee ferme so being behind to the said testator
in his life time, or in the seasin or possession of any other person, or
persons, claiming the said lands, tenements, and hereditaments only by and
from the said tenant by purchase, gift, or descent, in such like manner and
form, as their said testator might, or ought to have done in his life time:
And the said executors and administrators shall for the same distress,
lawfully make auowrie upon their matter aforesaid. Provided always, that this
act nor any thing therein contained, shall not extend to any such manor,
lordship, or dominion in Wales, or in the marches of the same, whereof the
inhabitants have used time without mind of man, to pay unto every Lord or
owner of such lordship, manor or dominion, at his or their first entry into
the same, any sum or sums of money, for the redemption and discharge of all
duties, forfaitures, and penalties, wherewith the same inhabitants were
chargeable unto any of the said lords, ancestors, or predecessors before his
said entry.

And further, be it, etc. that if any man which now has, or hereafter shall
have, in the right of his wife, any estate of fee simple, or fee tail, or fee
ferme, and the same rents, or fee fermes now be, or hereafter shall be due,
behind and unpaid in the wives life, then the said husband after the death
of his said wife, his executors, and administrators, shall have an action of
debt for the said arrerages, against the tenant of the demaine, that ought to
have paid the same, his executors or administrators; and also the said
husband, after the death of his said wife, may distraine for the said
arrerages in like manner and form, as he might have done if his said wife had
been living, and make auowrie upon his matter, as is aforesaid. And likewise
it is, etc. that if any person or persons, which now has, or hereafter shall
have, any rentes, or fee fermes, for term of life, or lives, of any other
person or persons, and the said rent or fee ferme, now or hereafter shall be
due, behind and unpaid in the life of such person or persons, for whose life
or lives the state of the said rent or fee ferme did depend and continue: And
if the said persons do die, then he unto whom the said rent or fee ferme
was due in form aforesaid, his executors or administrators shall, and may
have an action of debt against the tenant in demain, that ought to have paid
the same when it was first due, his executors and administrators, and also
distraine for the same arrerages upon such lands and tenements, out of the
which the said rentes or fee fermes were issuing and paiable, in such like
manner and form as he ought, or might have done, if such person or persons, by
whose death the aforesaid estates in the said rents and fee fermes was
determined and expired, had been in full life and not dead; and the auowrie
for the taking of the same distress, to be made in manner and form aforesaid.

the first testator, shall not be put in execution for the debt of the second

After the consideration of the estate of the prudent, diligent and faithful
Io. de Canib. Tract. de execut vlt. volunt. ^. particula. q. 1.
: wherein if there be any defecte, I mean if either he be ignorant,
negligent, or unfaithful, he is very like to find the office very

, unless there be certain hope, that being ignorant he will use the advice
of those that be skillful, and that of a negligent person he will become
diligent, easinge himself also of such business, as might hinder the
expedition of this office, and that howsoever he had behaved himself in other
affairs unfaithfully: yet in this office he will have an honest care, well
and truly to discharge that trust committed unto him, always having before
his eyes, not only the forfeiture of his bond, by his unfaithful dealing,
together with the ignominy by deceiving the dead man's expectation, but also
the danger of his soul by the breach of his oath: for he must be sworn to
execute the will, and to administer Hoc viridi obseruantia passim fit notorium,

. If a wife during the couerture be named executrix, there is this further to
be considered in her person, that she alone cannot sue for any debt due to the
testator, nor be sued for any debt due by the testator, without her husband
Brook Abridg. tit. execut. n. 178.
: but she alone may do any act extraiudiciall, as the paying of debts or
legacies, or the receiving or releasing of any debtes due to the testator
Brook. eod. n. 178.
: yea the husband without the wife (though she alone be executrix) may do any
extraiudiciall act, as well as his wife executrix Fitzh. Abridg. tit. exec. n.
23. 40. Brook. eod. tit. n. 147. 151. 152.
: and therefore if the husband release or remit any debt due to the testator,
the same is good and auailable, not only during the marriage, but also after
the death of her husband Fitzh. and Brook. vbi supra.
. But if the wife die, the husband cannot convert any of the goods and cattels
belonging to the first testator to his own proper use; for of such goods the
wife her self may make a testament, appointing an executor without the license
of her husband, as is before more fully declared Supra. 2. part.. 9.
.

Finally, concerning the persons of other with whom thou that art named
executor in the testament have to deal; it behooves thee coexecutor Io. de
Canibus. Tract. de exec. vlt. vol. particula. 2. q. 1. n. 17.
, (if any be) least he be an ouermatch for thee, that is to say, whether he be
of more experience, and greater wealth then thou art, and namely whether he be
a covetous and contentious person Io. de Cani. d. q. 1. n. 18
. If he be, take thou good heed, for it is to be feared, that he will keep all
the goods Brook Abridg. tit. exec. n. 98.
, that he alone will receive the debts due to the testator, and make them a
release, for this also he may do Brook. tit. exec. n. 37
: without doubt, if he be such a person, he has learned this lesson, that one
executor cannot sue another, for possession of Brook. eod. tit. n. 98.

and no man can sue himself Arg. c. debitum de baptis. extr. L. praeter. ff de

. After consideration of thy coexecutor, there is regard also to be had to the
rest of those persons with whom thou art to deal, viz. to the creditors and

legacies L. scimus. C. de iure delib.

By the due consideration of those things, viz. First, of the estate or
condition of the testator: secondly, of his own estate; and thirdly of the
coexecutor or other person with whom he is to have any dealing, it is not hard
in my opinion for the executor to collect, whether it is likely to be
beneficial or hurtful, to accept or refuse the executorship, and to resolve
accordingly, at the least if hereunto he also take a view of those things

accepting the executorship (amongst other things De quibus consulas velim Io.

.

Of diverse questions about the making of an inuentarie: and first, whether it
be of necessity that an Inuentarie be made.
1 By the laws ecclesiastical of this realm, and statutes of the same, an
inuentarie is necessary.

2 The executor which presumes to administer the goods, and refuses to make
an inuentarie, may be punished.

3 The reason of this necessity.

. vi.
COncerning the making of an inuentarie, it is expedient to understand whether
it be simply necessary that an inuentarie be made, what things are to be put
into the inuentarie; within what time the inuentarie is to be made; in what
manner; and what be the effects of an inuentarie.

That an inuentarie is necessary to be made Legatin. libertatem. tit. de
executor. testam. c. statutum.. inhibemus. lib. 3. prouincial. constit. Cant.
, confirmed by continual use; as also by the statutes Stat. H. 8. an. 21. c. 5.
of the same: neither ought the executor to meddle d.. inhibemus.
. And if any executor refuse to make an inuentarie, and nevertheless presume
to administer the goods of the deceased, he may be punished at the discretion
of the Bishop or Ordinary Legatin. libertatem. de executor. testa.
.

The reason is, least the executor being disposed Francis. Porcellin. Tract. de
inuentario. q. 1. per. sancimus. de haered. and fall. in Auth.
.

What things are to be put into the inuentarie.
1 All goods, cattels, wares, merchandises, moveable and immovable, are to be
put into the inuentarie.

2 Leases are to be put into the inuentarie.

3 Corn on the ground is to be put into the inuentarie.

4 Grass or trees growing, are not to be put into the inuentarie.

5 Whether such things as are affixed to the freeholde, ought to be inuentaried.

6 Whether debts are to be put into the inuentarie.

7 Whether money due for land, is to be put into the inuentarie.

to make diligent examination, whether the testator did owe any such: for many
times debtes are thrust into the inuentarie which are not due by the testator,
and so the legataries and children of the deceased, are often defrauded, at
least of some part of their due, by the unfaithfulness of the executor, and
negligence of the Ordinary, or his officer.

Within what time the inuentarie is to be made.
1 The time for making and exhibiting the inuentarie, is left to the moderation
of the ordinary.

2 The inuentarie ought to be made before the executor meddle with the
testators goods, except in some cases.

BY the statutes of this realm Stat. H. 8. an. 21. c. 5.

testamentarie in making of an inuentarie; viz. that the executor or executors,
named by

De quibus DD. in L. fin.. sin autem. C. de iure delib.
, this order was observed: First of all the moveable goods were inuentaried
and praised, as household stuff, corn, and cattle, etc. then the immovable,
as leases of grounds or tenements, after that the debts due to the testator
were set down Franc. Porcel. Tract. de inuentario.
, which order is for the most part observed at this time here in England:
saving that some do omit leases, wherein they do amiss Supra ead. part.. 7.

severally.

Of the effect and benefit of an inuentarie.
1 The goods contained in the inuentarie are presumed to be in the hands of
the executor.

2 The testator is presumed to have no more goods then are described in the
inuentarie.

3 Whether sufficiency of goods be presumed when there is no inuentarie.

Notable goods, in this place, or when they are so to be termed, diverse
authors have been of diverse opinions. Some have been of this opinion, that if
the testator died possessed of goods, or cattels, to the value of forty
shillings, in two several diocesses; then he ought to be deemed to have notable
goods Perkins. tit. testament. fol. 94.
. Others have been of this mind, that the testator is to be deemed to have
notable goods, though at the time of his death he had but one penie in another
Diocese Fitzh. tit. adm^str. n. 7.
. Others do not only vary from the former opinions, but are also at variance
with them selves, accounting those for notable goods, sometimes when they
extend clearly to a hundred shillinges sterling: some times when they extend
to ten pound eleven shillings, vj. pence: sometimes when they extend to xxiij.
pound three shillings, farthing, and not under Lindw. in d. c. statutum. verb.

. Finally, others are of this judgment, that he is said to have notable goods,
which has goods to the value of ten pound of current money of England,
dispersed in diverse diocesses or jurisdictions: and this opinion seems to me
to be most commonly received Plowd. in casu inter. Greisb. and Fox. fol. 281.

By whom the testament is to be proved.
1 The testament is to be proved by the executor.

2 Any person having the testament may be compelled to exhibit the same.

THe person by whom the testament Perkins. tit. testament. fol. 93.

testaments, may convent, to the intent to prove the testament, and to take upon
him the execution thereof, or else to refuse the same Stat. H. 8. an. 21. c. 5.

to have the same, unless he affirm upon his oath, that the same is not in his

When the testament is to be exhibited and proved.
1 The testament is not to be proved whiles the testator lives, but after his
death.

2 If it be unknown whether the testator be dead or alive, whether may his
testament be proved.

If the testator be dead, the Judge may proceed to the proving of the will

Quam opinionem (tanquam commune^) acriter defendit Viuius. Thesaur. com. op.

: it seems by this opinion, that the Judge may not in the mean time proceed
to the publication of the testament, unless there be lawful proof, or
sufficient prescription for the testators death. On the contrary, others are
of opinion, that a man is not presumed to live so long, that is to say, until
he attain to an hundred years Quorum opinione^ magis communem refert
Molinaeus in Apostil. ad Alex. consil. 1. vol. 5. n. 24.

: and so by their opinion, it seems that the will may be proved after the
age of seventy years, of him that is absent, for that he is not then
presumed to be living.

I suppose if a man be absent, and no certain proof of his death, or life,
that the will may be proved, and that the testament it self is a presumption

Of the manner of proouing Testaments.
1 The form of proouing testaments, is twofold.

2 Of the vulgar form.

3 Of the form of law.

4 Of the difference betwixt the vulgar and the legal form.

5 Of a third form of probation of testaments.

6 Of the oath and bond of the executor.

. xiiij.
THat it is necessary for the proof of testaments, that there be either
witness or writing, is already declared Supra p^rt. 4.. 1.
: Also what number of witnesses, and what manner of writing is sufficient, is
likewise declared Supra d. part. 4.. 25. 26.
: wherefore in this place, I shall not need to speak, saving only of the
manner of procee^ing in the probation and approbation of testaments.

This manner and form therefore here in vulgar or common form, the other is
termed, the solemn form, or form of law Ad imitationem co^firmationis, quae

consuet. Paris.. 5. Alex. consil. 123. vol. 4. n. 18. etc. Dec in Rub. de

.

The vulgar or common form, is more compendious the testament to the Judge,
and in the absence, and without citing or calling of such as have interest,
produces witnesses to prove the same, who testifiyng upon their oaths (viua
voce) that the testament exhibited, is the true, whole, and last testament of
the party deceased Stat. H. 8. an. 21. c. 5.
: The judge does thereupon, and sometimes upon lesser proof, annex his probate
and seal to the testament, whereby the same is confirmed Quae omnia

Besides these forms of proving testaments publicatio testamenti De qua in d.

require that the witnesses should put to their seals, and after the death of
the testator, at the opening of this written or closed testament; the same law
did also require that the same witnesses should be called by the magistrate to
acknowledge their seals L. 4. ff. quemadmodum testa. app.
, or to deny the sealing L. 5. eod. tit. quemad.
. But as we do not observe that solemnity of the civil law in the sealing
of the testaments by the witnesses; no more do we observe that solemnity
which the civil law requires in opening of testamentes sealed, unless this
may seem to have some resemblance with this third form, de apertura
testamenti, which is enacted in the statutes of this realm, viz. that the
Bishop or Ordinary, or other person having authority to take probate of
testaments, upon the delivery of the seal and sign of the testator, do
cause the same seal to be defaced, and thereupon incontinent redeliuer the
same sealed unto the executoror executors, without claim or challenge
thereunto, to be made Stat. H. 8. an. 21. c. 5. Crederem tamen huiusmodi verba

IT is enacted and established by the statutes of this realm Stat. H. 8. an.
21. c. 5.
, that from the first day of April, anno domini 1530, that nothing shall
insinuatio^, or approbation of testame^ts, or testaments by himself, or
themselves, nor by his or their registers, scribes, praisers, su^moners,
apparators, or by any other of their ministers for the probation, insinuation,
and approbation of any testament, or testaments, or for what writing, sealing,
praising, regestring, sines making of Inuentaries, and giving in of
acquittances, or for any other manner of cause concerning the same, where the
goods of the testator of the said testament, or person so dying, do not amount
clearly over and above the value of an hundred shillings sterling, except only
to the scribe, to have for writing the probate of the testament of him
deceased, whose goods shall not be above the same clear value of an hundred
shillings, six pence; and for the commission for the ministration of the
goods of any man deceasing intestate, not being above like value of an C.
shillings clear, six pence. And that nevertheless, the Bishop, Ordinary, or
other person or persons, having power or authority to take or receive the
probatio^ or approbation of testaments, refuse not to approve any such
testament, being lawfully tendered or offered to them, to be proved or
approved, whereof the goods of the person so dying, amount not above the value
of an hundred shillings sterling: so that the same testament be exhibited by
him or them in writing, which was thereunto affixed ready to be sealed, and
that the same testament be lawfully proved before the same Ordinary (before
the sealing) to be the true, whole, and last testament of the same testator, in
such form as has been commonly accustomed in that behalf.

And when the goods of the testator do

And where the goods of the testator, or person or persons, now having, or
which hereafter shall have power or authority to take probate of testaments,
as is aforesaid, by him or themselves, or any of his or their registers,
scribes, praisers, su^moners, apparators, or any other their ministers, for
the probation, insinuation and approbation of any testament or testaments, or
for the registring, sealing, writing, praising, making of inuentaries, fines,
giving of acquittances, or any thing concerning the same probate of testaments,
shall from the said first day of April, take or cause to be taken, of any
person or persons, but only five shillings, and not above, whereof to be to
the said Bishop, Ordinary, or other person, having power to take the
probation of such testament or testaments, for him and his ministers, two
shillings six pence, and not above, and two shillings, six pence residue of
the same five shillings, to be to the scribe for registring of the same, or
else the same scribe to be at his liberty to refuse two shillings six pence,
and to demand and have for writing of every ten lines of the same testament,
whereof every line to contain ten inches in length, one penie.

And in case any person or persons, at any time hereafter require a copy or
copies of the said testamentes so proved, or of the said inuentarie so made,
that then the said Ordinary or Ordinaries, and the other persons having
authority to take probate of testaments, or their ministers, shall from time
to time, with convenient speed, without any frustratarie delay deliver, or
cause to be delivered, a true copy or copies of the same, to the said person
so demanding them, or any of them, taking for the search, and for the making of
the copy, either of the said testament or inuentarie, but only such fee as is
before rehearsed, for the registring of the said testament; or else the said
scribe or register to be at his election, to demand, have, and take for every
ten lines thereof, being full proportion before rehearsed, one penie.

Provided always, that where any person or persons, having power or
authority, have used to take less sums of money then is abouesaid for the
probate of testaments commissions, or administrations, or other cause
concerning the same, shall take or receive such sum or sums of money for the
probate of testaments and commissions of the administrators, and other causes
concerning the same, as they before the making of this act have used to take,
and above.

And it is enacted, that every Bishop, Ordinary, over that shall loose and
forfaite ten pound sterling, whereof the one moitie shall be to the king,
and the other moitie to the party grieved in that behalf, that will sue in
any of the kings Courts for the recovery of the same, in which action, no

the executor, to discharge which obligation, and to gratify which of the
creditors he will Brook. vbi supr. Doct. and Stud. lib. 2. c. 10.
; which being done, the other creditors be without remedy, if there be no
assets, unless the day of payment in the one obligation be expired, and the
day of payment of the other obligation is not yet come; in which case the
former obligation is to be first satisfied Brook. d. tit. exec. n. 172.

in the power of the executor to discharge an other obligation, for the which no
action is brought in prejudice of the former suite Brook. d. n. 172.

several actions against the executor, he that first obtains judgment, must

promise or assumption made by the testator in his life time by word only
without writing, if there be assets Brook. tit. executor. n. 171.
: But if there be no assets to satisfy all these aforesaid creditors, then
observing the order aforesaid, beginning with the payment of the debt due to

Concerning Mortuaries, it is enacted by Stat. H. 8. an. 21. c. 6.
. No parson,

First it is enacted, that no manner of Mortuarie value of ten mark.











Provided that no woman being covert baron, ne child, nor for any person not
keeping house any Mortuarie be paid, ne that any parson, vicar, curate, parish
priest or other, ask, demand, or take for any such woman, child, or for any
person not keeping house, dying or dead, any manner of thing or money by way of
Mortuarie.

Ne also for any warfaring man, or other that dwells not, ne makes residence
in the place where they shall happen to die, but that the Mortuarie of such
warfaring persons be answerable in places where Mortuaries be accustomed to be
paid, and in manner and form, and after the rate before mentioned, and no
otherwise in place or places where such warfaring persons at the time of their
death had the most habitation house and dwelling places, and no else where.

Provided always, that it shall be lawful

And be it, etc. that no Mortuaries or corses presents, or any sum or sums
of money, or other thing for any Mortuarie or corse present, shall be
demanded, taken, received, or had in the parts of Wales, nor in the marches of
the same, nor in the towns of Calice, or Berwicke, nor the marches of the
same, but only in such parts and places of Wales, marches, and towns
aforeraide, where Mortuaries have been accustomed to be taken, and paid: and
in those parts and places, no mortuaries or corses presents, ne any other thing
for Mortuarie or corse present, from henceforth shall be demanded, taken,
received or had, but only after the form, order, and manner above specified in
this present act, and none otherwise, ne of any other person or persons then
is limited in this present act, and none otherwise, upon pain above contained
in this present act.

Provided also, that it shall be lawful to the Bishops of Bangors, Landaffe,
Saint David's, and Saint Ass, and likewise to the Archdeacon of Chester, to
take such Mortuaries of the Priests within the Diocesses and jurisdictions as
heretofore has been accustomed.

Provided always, that in such places where Mortuaries have been accustomed
to be taken of less value then is aforesaid, that no person shall be
compelled to pay in any such place, any such Mortuarie then has been
accustomed, ne that any mortuarie in such place shall be demanded, taken,
received, or had of any such person or persons exempt by this act, nor in any
wise contrary to this act, upon pain before limited.

Of making an account, and first of the necessity thereof.
1 Diverse reasons wherefore executors are to account.

2 Whether the executor be subject to account, being released by the testator.

. xvii.
HEre many things may be considered Super hac materia vide. Io. de Can. in
Tract. de executor. vlt. vol.. nouissimum. n. 4. and Io. Olden. consi. Tract.
tit. 8.
, namely, how needful it is that executors should be accomptable; To whom the
account is to be made; within what time; in what manner, and what effects the
same has.

How requisite and needful a thing it is, Argument. a. quoniam in Authentic.
vt hi qui oblig.
. Surely if it stand with reason, that stewardes, receivers, bailifes, tutors,
factors, and such as have to deal for other persons, should be accountable
of their stewardship, receiuership, and their other offices Io. de Canib. in
d.. nouissimum. n. 1. Menoch. de arb. iud. lib. 2. cas. 209.
, with greater reason may it be maintained, that an executor should be subject
to account, rather then they: for they for the most part have to deal for such
as be living, who may have an eye to their doings: but an executor has to
deal for a dead person, who can neither see nor hear, if his executor deal
unjustly. Again, if the executor have well and faithfully executed his office,
and fully discharged the trust reposed in him: what should move him that he
should not willingly make a due account thereof; and thereby obtain an
acquittance, and be delivered from the burden laid upon him Io. Oldendorp.
Tract. de executor. vlt. vol. tit. 8.
? On the contrary, if he have played the unjust steward, much rather in that
case, ought he to be urged and compelled to make his account, that his fraud
and deceit being detected, he may be justly punished, and others by his
punishment premonished Olden. vbi supra.
. By this also that as well the civil laws, as the ecclesiastical law, be so
precise in making of inuentaries, we may learn the necessity in making of an
account: for if executors were not accountable, the use of inuentaries were to
little purpose Io. de Canib. in d.. nouissimum.
.

To conclude, all equal laws of every well governed common wealth, have
favored the execution of testaments, and last wills of men deceased, and have
had special care that they should not be frustrated: and therefore no man can
with safe conscience, speak against the rendering of an account, or seek
immunitie from Old. d. Tract. tit. 8.
. Insomuch that if the testator should discharge his executor from making an
account: yet nevertheless, if the executor deal fraudulently, the Ordinary
may in his discretion, exact an account at his hands for the reformation of
such fraud Lind. in c. religiosa. verb. rationem. de testam. lib. 3
prouincial. constit. Cant. Io. de Athon. in magna gloss. in Legatin.
libertatem. de exec. testam. Io. de Canib. and Io. Olden. locis superius
citat^s.
: for it is not to be presumed, that the testator in granting to the executor
immunitie from making an account, did think that the executor would deal
unjustly and fraudulently Lind. Io. de Canib. and Io. Olden. vbi supra.
, and so did not pardon any such injustice or fraud, whereof he had no
conceit L. si quis. ff. de lib. leg.
, but rather hoped that the executor would discharge his office with all
fidelity, so that there should not need any account, and in that respect only
(I mean in the case of his fidelity) did acquit him from rendering of an
account Lind. vbi supra.
.

To whom the account ought to be made.
1 The account is to be made to the Ordinary.

2 Whether the account is to be made to the creditors or legataries.

3 Whether the account is to be made to the coexecutor.

. xviij.
THe account is to be made by the Clem. Vnic. de testa. c. statutum.. and

he examineth the account of every executor; and the father of the fatherless,
for that to poor Orphans he is in steed of a father Io. de Canib. in d..
nouissimum. n. 9.
, in providing how they may obtain that which is left unto them, by the
testament of their father or other person deceased.

Io. de Canib. in d.. nouissimum.
, yet I suppose that at the instance or promotion of such legataries and
creditors inuocating the office of the Judge, he may be compelled to render an
account to the Ordinary iudicially Per ea quae inferius scribuntur ead. part..

2 Of the general and particular account.

general account of his whole executorship, before he have had sufficient time
for the performance of the will Lindw. in d.. and postquam. verb. congrue. and

(which is a twelve month L. nulli. C. de Episc. and cler. Boie. in c. tua

:) Nevertheless in the mean time, if the executor do not administer
faithfully; or if the Ordinary think it convenient, the executor may be
compelled to make a particular account Lind. in d. c. statutum verb. congrue.
and verb. rationem reddere. Io. de Canib. de executor. vlt. vol.. nouissimum.
q. 10.
, and so in diverse respects the law has appointed the time diversely.

But whatsoever the law has determined herein, it is for the most part every
where within this realm observed, that the executors promise to the Ordinary
by virtue of their oath, to make a true and perfect account, whenever they
shall be thereunto called by the said Ordinary Text. in d.. postquam.
, and therefore may be called to a general account within the year Io. de
Athon. gloss. in Legatin. libertatem. verb. approbatam.

further information in this behalf.

De forma reddendi rationem praeclare Olden. in Tract. de executor. vlt. vol.

use, more then is given him by the testator, or which the Ordinary shall
allow him for his laobur, or for the like consideration Text. in d..
statuimus, Quod tamen intellige prout supra scripsi ead. part.. 1. in fin.
. But of this distribution of the residue (in pios vsus) there is but small use
in these days, as well for that the residue is commonly left to the executors,
as also for that the executors are afraid that some unknown debts due by the
testator, should afterward arise, and so the executor be compelled to pay the
same out of his own purse.

If we respect what is to be performed by the Ordinary in the making of this
account, I Menoch. d. cas. 209. Olden. d. tit. 8.

be allowed are not to be allowed, but honest and moderate, according to the
condition of the persons d. c. statutum.. statuimus. Old. d. tit. 8. n. 5.

same to be true and perfect, may pronounce for the validity thereof, and so
acquit the executor, so far forth as appertains to the ecclesiastical
court De qua re attende^dus est cuiusque fori stilus.

The seventh part.
1 Testaments lose their force two ways.

2 By what means testaments are void from the beginning.

3 By what means the testament once good, is made void afterward.

4 How we may know when the testament is void from the beginning.

. i.
HItherto of those things which apperteine to the making and accomplishing of
testaments: now of such things as tend to the dissolution thereof.

De quibus Vigelius in sua method. iur. civil. lib. 9. c. 5. cum seq.
: yet they may be reduced to two Viglius in tit. quib. mod. testa. infir.
Instit.
.

The first is, when there is some original or corruption in the testament L.
si quaeramus. ff. de testa.
, which may happen diverse ways, either because the testator is such a person
as cannot make a testament or last will Supra part. 2.
, or because the things bequeathed are not deuisable by will Supra part. 3.
, or because the manner of the disposition is unlawful Supra part. 4.
, or for that the person named executor is incapable thereof Supra part. 5.
, or for some other cause hereafter expressed Infr.. prox. cum. seq. vsque ad.
14.
: and such a testament or last will being void originally, or from the
beginning, is called Nullum, sometimes iniustum, or non iure factum Minsing. and
Vigl. in d. tit. quib. mod. testa. infir. Instit.
.

The other means is, when the testament does afterward become void Vigl. in
d. tit. quibus mod. testa. infir.
. And this also may happen diverse ways, as by the making of a later
testament. posteriore. Instit. quib. mod. testa. infir. and infra. 14.
, or by reuoking or cancelling of that which is made L. 1. de his quae testa.
del. ff. and inf.. 15. 16.
, or by alteration of the state of the testator. alio Instit. quibus mod.
testa. infir. and infra. 17.
, or by forbidding or hindering the testator to make another testament Tit. si
quis aliquem restari prohib. ff. and C. and infra. 18.
, or if he that is named executor will not, or does become unable to be
executor L. 1. ff. de iniust. rup. and irrit. testam. and infr.. 19.
, and by many other means more particularly showed hereafter Infr.. 20. cum
reliquis vsque ad finem
. And this kind of testament which once being good, becomes void ex post
facto, is sometimes called ruptum, sometimes irritum Tit. de iniust. rupt and
irrit. testam. ff. d.. alio Instit. quib. med. testa. infir.
.

Touching the former of these void testaments, forasmuch as we have already
declared who may make a testament, what thing may be disposed, what form is
lawful, and who may be executor or legatarie: and on the contrary, what
person can not make a testament, what thing cannot be devised, what form is
not lawful, and what person is not capable of an executorship or legacy, it
is a matter of little labor, and less difficulty, by examination of the
premises, to collect and discern when the testament is originally void,
either in respect of the testator, or of the thing bequeathed, or of the form
of the disposition, or of the person of the executor or legatarie. Whereunto it
may be added, that the testament is originally void, or at the least voidable
by exception, when the testator is compelled by fear Infra. prox.
, or circumuented by fraud Infra.. 3.
, or overcome by immoderate flattery Infra. 4.
, to make the same. It is also void from the beginning, sometimes by reason of
error Infra. 5.
, sometimes by reason of uncertainty Infra. 6. cum seq.
, and sometimes by reason of imperfection Infra. 12.
, and sometimes because the testator has not animu^ testandi Infr.. 13.
, a meaning to make his testament or last will.

Touching the other kind of these testamentes, such I mean as were good at
the first, but do become void afterward, we shall speak more particularly
hereafter.

Of the testament made by fear.
1 Exception of fear destroieth the testament.

2 Whether this exception be prejudicial to any other then to the author
thereof.

3 What if the testament be confirmed with an oath.

4 What if the fear be not of present hurt.

5 What if the testament be made after the time of the violence offered, and
not at that instant.

6 Whether the testament made by fear be void, ipso iure.

7 Vain fear hinders not the validity of the testament.

8 The testament confirmed after fear be past, is good.

9 The testament is good, saving in favor of the author of this fear and his

10 What if the testator protest that he made his testament being compelled by
fear, whether does this protestation make void the testament.

. ii.
NOthing is more contrary to free consent then fear Nihil consensui. de reg.
iur. ff.
: worthily Bar. in L. fin. si quis aliquem testari prohib. ff. Ias. and
Sichard. in Rub. si quis aliquem. C. quamuis communi Doctorum opinione,
huiusmodi testamentu^ non sit ipso iure nullu^. vt per Grass. Thesaur. com.
op.. testm^. q. 83. Soarez. lib. rec. senten. verb. testam. n. 56. 57.
, which conclusion is diversely both extended and limited.

The first extension is, that the testament made by fear is ineffectual, not
only in respect of Gloss. in Rub. si quis aliquem prohib. ff. Bar. in d. L.
fin. Boss. Tract. var. tit. de his qui prohib. aliquem testari. n. 4.
; albeit ignorant of that fear wherewith the testator was constrained in that
behalf Bar. and Boss. vbi supra contrariam tamen opinionem tenent Ias. and
Sichard. in Rub. si quis aliquem. C. sed distingue, vt infra in limitac. 4.
.

Secondly the testament is overthrown c. quamuis. de pactis. lib. 6.
. For where a man being overcome with fear, to the end he may escape that
danger, does swear with his mouth to perform that thing, which he intends
not in his heart: this oath does not give any strength to that act DD. in d.
c. quamuis. Felin. in c. si vero. de iureiur. extra. n. 8. declar. 4.
; but contrariwise the act is so much the weaker, by how much the suspicion of
fear by this extorted oath is made the stronger.

Sichard. in d. Rub. si quis aliquem. C. n. 1. Ias. in. quadrupli. Instit. de
action. vbi tradit quinque genera metus
: although by the civil law in other respects, that is to say, of greater or
lesser punishment of the author of this fear, there is great difference,
whether he exercise violence against the testator, or threatenings only, as
also whether the violence be open or secret Sichard. in d. Rub. Iul. Clar..
falsum. and pract. criminal. q. 83.
, of which punishment we have no great use in England except it be for
forgerie of wills Stat. Eliz. an. 5. c. 14.
.

Zas. in L. si ob turpe^. ff. de cond. indeb. Peckius. Tract. de testa. coniug.
lib. 1. tit. 9. n. 3.
.

The limitations of this former conclusion ipso iure, but voidable by the help
of excepton Bar in L. sin. si quis aliquem testari prohib. ff. Are. in L. 1.
ff. de testa.
: the reason is, because he that does an act through fear, does after a sort
consent L. si mulier. pen. ff. quod me. causa.
, that is to say, of two evils he chooses the less Wesenb. in tit. quod met.
causa. ff.
, and is willing rather to make a testament, then to incur the peril
threatened Wesenb. ibid.
. And albeit some be of this opinion, that the testament made by fear is
void, ipso iure; and that in this case a constrained will is no will, being
rather noluntas then voluntas Vasq. de success. crea.. 17. requisite. 22. Ias.
in Rub. si quis ali. quem testari prohib. C.
, yet the common opinion is against them Vasq. d.. 17. n. 5.
, unless the coaction be not conditional, but precise, necessary, and
ineuitiable Quia tunc omnino deest voluntas. Wesen. in tit. quod met. causa.

The second limitation is, when the fear L. si quis ab alio. ff. de re. iud.
L. vani de reg. iur. ff.
(for a just fear only, that is such a fear as may move a constant man or
woman, makes void the testament c. ad audientiam. c. cum dilectus de his quae
me. cum extra. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol lib. 2. tit. 7. n. 6.
; as the fear of death, or of bodily hurt, or of imprisonment, or of the loss
of al or most part of goods, and such like fear) whereof no certain rule can
be delivered, but is left to the discretion of the Judge, who ought not only to
consider the quality of the threatenings, but also the persons as well
threatened, as threatening; and in the threatened the sex, the age, the courage,
or pusillaminitie: and in the person threatening, the power, the disposition,
and whether he be a mere boaster, or performer of his threats Menoch. de
Arb. Iud cas. 135. Mascar. Tract. de probac. concl. 1054. Idem Menoch. Tract.
de praesump. lib. 3. praes. 126.
.

Thirdly, if the testator afterward, when L. 2. C. de his quae vi, etc. L. si
ob turpem. ff de condict. in deb. Sichard. in L. si per vim. C. de his quae vi,
etc. n. 3.
.

Fourthly, where it is said that the testament in that respect is not
unlawful Bar. in d. L. ^in. n. 3. si quis. aliq. ff. Bal. in L. 1. eod. tit.
C. n. 7.
.

Bald. in d. L. 1. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. volu. lib. 2. tit. 7. n. 5.
: but if the testator do express by whom he was constrained, protesting
that he would gladly alter the testament, but for fear of the persons by him
named; by such assertion the testament is void, at the least in the prejudice
of those persons Mantic. vbi supra. Sichard. in Rub. si quis aliquem testari
prohib. C. n. 5.
.

Of testaments made by fraud.
1 Fraud as detestable as force.

2 Whether all manner of deceit be evil.

3 What if the deceit be very small.

. iii.
Olden. de action. class. 5. fol. 518. in actio^. ex testamento.
, wherefore when the testator is circumuented by fraud, the testament is of no
more force, then if he were constrained by fear L non enim. de inoffic.
testa. L. 1. de excep. doli. ff.
.

Zas. in tit. de dolo malo. ff.
) such deceit does not hinder the testament Bald. in L. 1. si quis aliquem
testari prohib C. and Sichard. in Rub. ibidem.
: for example, the testator intending to bestow all his goods upon some vile
and naughty person, omitting his honest wife and dutiful children; if the
wife or children beguile the testator, persuading him that that lewd person is
dead, or by some other means deceive the testator, and so procure themselves
to be made executors, or universal legataries: this deceit is not reproved as
evil, and therefore the testament is not to be repelled as unlawful Bald. in
d. L. 1. n. 17.
.

It seems also, that the testament is not c. cum dilectus. de his quae vi vel
metus causa extra.
: for as that fear only is termed just, and is able to overthrow the
testament, which may overcome a constant man: so that deceit only seems
sufficient to repel the approbation of a testament, which may deceive a
prudent person Panor. in d. c. cum dilectus. n. 4. Marsil. sing. 207. Alex. in
apostil. ad lect. Bar. in L. eleganter. ff. de dolo. in prin. d. L.
. Howbeit (if this limitation be true) yet as in that case it is left to the
discretion of the Judge to determine what fear is just, respecting the
quality of the threats, together with the disposition of the parties: so in
this case the judge comparing the deceit with the capacity or understanding
of the person deceived, may best discern, whether it be such a deceit as may
overthrow the testament or not Arg. d. c. dilectus.
.

How the testator may be induced by fraud too make or revoke his testament,
were it not that the crafty would put the same in practice, is a thing not
altogether unworthy the understanding. But lest by instructing the better to
avoid the same, I might also teach the evil affected to follow the same:
Suffices it, to refer the reader to that which has been spoken of captious
wills Supra part. 4.. 11.

testator to make or alter his will Infra. 18.

Of testaments made by flattery.
1 Flatteringe persuasions not always unlawful.

2 What if fear go before.

3 What if fraud be intermingled with flattery.

4 What if the testator be under the government of the flatterer.

5 What if the flatteries be immoderate.

6 What if the testator have made a former testament.

. iiij.
Olden. de action. class. 5. fol. 518. action. ex testament^.
: neither is it altogether unlawful for a man, even with fair and flattering
speeches, to move the testator to make him his executor, or to give him his
goods L. vlt. si quis aliquem testari prohib. ff. and C. ac DD. ibidem.

The third case is, when the testator, is a person of weak judgment, and
easy to be persuaded, and the legacy great Molin. in apostil. ad Dec. consil.

The fourth case like unto this is, when Molin. in d. Apostil.
: And therefore if the physician during the time of sickness, be instant with
the testator to make him his executor, or to give him his goods, this testament
is not good Peckius de testam. coniug. lib. 1. c. 9 n. 6. Bar. in L. Archiatr.
de profess. and med. lib. 10. C
; for the law presumes, that the testator did it, least the physician should
forsake him, or negligently cure him Peckius vbi supra. and in c. 17. eod. lib.
Lucas de penna in d. L. Archiatri. iuxta illud Poetae. Garrulus aegroto
medicus, si forte medetur: Alter adest morbus continuusque dolor.
. So it is if the testator being sick, his wife neglect to help him, or to
provide remedy for the recovery of his health, and nevertheless in the mean
time busily apply him with sweet and flattering speeches, to make her his
executrix, or to bestow his goods upon her: for in this case, the disposition
is ineffectual Peckius. d. lib. 1. de testa. coniug. c. 9. n. 5. Mathe. de
afflict. decis. 69.
.

The fifth case is, when the perswader is very c. fin. 20. q. 3. Abb. in c.

Of error.
1 Error may happen in diverse respects.

2 Of error in the person of the executor or legatarie.

3 Of error in the name of the executor or legatarie.

4 Of error in the quality of the executor or legatarie.

5 Whether a false cause make void the disposition.

6 Error in the thing bequeathed, manifold.

7 Of error in the proper name of the thing bequeathed.

8 Of error in the name appellatiue of the thing bequeathed.

9 Of the difference betwixt a proper name, and a name appellatiue.

10 An objection with the answer.

11 Certain cases wherein error in the name appellatiue is not hurtful.

12 Error in the substance of the legacy, does destroy the legacy.

13 Error in the quantity of the thing bequeathed, is not hurtful.

14 Certain cases wherein error in quantity does destroy the legacy.

15 Certain cases wherein the error in the quantity of the thing bequeathed
as a certain body is not hurtful.

16 Error in the quality of the thing bequeathed, does not destroy the
legacy.

17 Error in the form of the disposition, does destroy the force thereof.

. v.
ERror does sometimes overthrow the disposition of the testator, sometimes not:
Therefore that we may understand whether this error hurt or not, we are to
consider executor or legatarie, or the thing bequeathed, or the form of the
disposition: And if it do respect the executor or legatarie, then whether the
testator do err in the person, or in the name, or in the quality of the
executor or legatarie.

When the testator does err in the person L. quoties. ff. de haered. instit.
: for example, the testator intending to make John at Style his executor, or to
give to John at Style an hundred pound, he says, I make John at Noke my
executor, or give I to John at Noke an hundred pound. In this case neither can
John at Style, nor John at Noke be executors, or obtain the legacy DD. in d.
L. quoties
. The reason is this: John at Noke is excluded, because the testator never
thought it. John at Style is excluded, because the testator never spoke it: for
meaning without speaking is nothing, and speech without meaning is less d. L.
quoties. and L. in ambiguo. ff. dereb. dub.
.

When the testator does err in the name such error does not hurt L. si. in
nomine. C. de testa.
, but in certain cases: one is when the testator is blind; for then it is
suspected that the testator does mistake the person, together with the name
Ias. and Sichard. in d. L. si in nomine. Ripa. in L. si quis in fund. ff. de
leg. 1. n. 9. quem vide.
. Another is, when the testator does err in the name of his own son Sicha.
in d. L. si in nomine. n. 14. Ripa. in L. si quis fundi. ff. de leg. 1. vbi
sublimitat hanc limitac. qua^do viz. natus and educatus esset silius in loco
remoto.
, or of his father Ripa. in d. L. si q^s. n. 8
: the reason is, for that this gross error does note the testator of folly
Sichard. and alij in d. L. si in nomine.
: But a fool, or he that is not of sound memory cannot make a testament Supra
2. part.. 1.
: much more is the disposition void, if the testator do err in his own name
Ias. in d. L. si in nomi.
: as if the testator say, I Peter make my testament, where his name is John:
for this is a plain and evident proof of his folly, or lack of sufficient
memory Bar. in L. cum in liberis. C. de haered. instit. and est communis
opinio, vt per Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. Institutio. q. 29. n. 2.
.

quality of the executor or legatarie, this error is not hurtful L. falsa

vol. lib. 4. tit. 5. n. 16. Paul. de Castro. in L. quoties. ff. de haered.
instit.
, unless that quality were the final cause wherefore the testator made him
executor or legatarie: for the error in such a quality does make void the
disposition L. neque professio. C. de testa.
: for example; the testator says, I make my cousin John at Style my executor,
or I give to my cousin John at Style an hundred pound: in this case, if John at
Style be not cousin to the testator, he cannot obtain the executorship, or
legacy d. L. neque. and ibi DD. and Grass. Thesaur. co^. op.. Insti. q. 29. n.
4. vbi refert hanc op. esse recepta^ ab omnibus, nisi fortasse restator solet
appellare illum co^sanguineum suum.
. Hereunto it may be added, that if the testator do erroniously express a
false cause, the disposition is void Bar. in L. demonstratio.. quod autem ff.
de cond. and demon. n. 13.
: for example; the testator says, because thou did lend me an hundred
pound, I bequeath unto thee an hundred pound Bar. vbi supra. verb. quaeda^
causa proxima.
; or because my son is dead, thou shall be my executor L. sui ff. de haered.
instit. Sichard. in Rub. de haered. instit. C. n. 3.
: In which cases the cause being false, the disposition is of no force. And
although it be written, that a false demonstration or false cause, does not
hurt the disposition L. cum tale.. falsam. de cond. and demon. ff.. long.
Instit. de lega.
: yet that is to be understood, where the testator does not ignorantly, but
wittingly Gloss. in L. 1. C. de falsa causa adiect. and ibi Doctores.
express the same.

But when the testator does ignorantly Bar. in d. L. demonstratio.. quod
autem. de cond. and demon. ff. n. 13. and Paul. de Castr. in d. L. n. 5.
, as without the which cause he would not have given that legacy Secus si

If the error touch the thing bequeathed, then name, or in the substance, or in
the quality, or in the quantity of the thing bequeathed.

The error of the testator in the proper name. siquidem in nomine. Instit. de
lega. quae sententia communis est. Grass. Thesaur. co^. op.. Legatum. q. 65.
: for example; the testator does bequeath his horse Bucephal, whereas the name
of his horse is Arundell: this error is not hurtful, but that the legatarie
may obtain the horse Arundell, if the testators meaning be certain Bar. Zas.
and alij, in L. si quis in fu^di. ff. de leg. 1.
: for names were devised to discern things L. labeo. ff. de sup. leg.
: If therefore we have the thing, it skilleth not for the name d.. si quidem
in nomine. Inst. de lega.
.

The error in the name appellatiue of the Si quis in fundi. ff. de leg. 1.
: for example; the testator intending to bequeath a horse, does bequeath an
ox, or meaning to bequeath gold, does bequeath apparel: in both these cases
the legacy is void d. L. si quis in fundi.
. The reason of the difference (I mean of the diverse effects betwixt the error
in proper names, and the error Minsing. in d.. si quidem in nomine. n. ^ DD. in
d. L. si quis. and in L. si in nomine. C. de testam.
. Against this reason it is commonly objected, that words or names are but
invented to signify things Text. in d.. si quide in nomine.
, and that the words of the testator are to be drawn even into an improper
sense, to maintain the will and disposition of the testator L non aliter. de
leg. 3. ff. Mantic, de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 3. tit. 5. n. 2.
. To the which objection it is answered, that these words which have a
manifold sense, may be stretched to that sense which is contained therein,
albeit improperly: but to comprehend that sense, which is not at all within
compass of the words, neither properly nor improperly, they may not be
stretched so far Ripa. and Zas. in L. si quis in fundi. ff. de leg. 1. ille.
n. 26. iste. n. 20.
, for then this conclusion has place: That which I would, I spoke not; that
which I spoke, I would not; and so neither is good L. in ambiguo. de reb. dub.
ff.
.

Gloss. in L. quae extrinsecus. ff. de verb. ob. Ias. in d. L. si quis in
fundi. qui ibi refert ha^c opinionem esse veram.
. Likewise if there be some conformity or similitude betwixt the name
appellatiue, and the name wherein the testator does err, the legacy is not
void: as if the testator meaning to bequeath his books, does bequeath his
papers Gloss. in d. L. si quis in fundi Bar. in L. quaesitum.. si mihi. de leg.
1. and est com. op. ait Grass. Thesaur. com. op. legatum. q. 65.
: or if the testator protest, that the legacy shall pass by those terms,
for then the error in the name appellatiue is not hurtful Gloss in d. L. si
quis in fundi. and quod haec. communis sit, numerat Ripa in d. L. si quis. n.
27. and Grass.. legatu^. q. 65.
: or if by common use of speech the name appellatiue be altered; for then it is
in the election of the testator, to use whether name he will, even that which
is less proper Ias. Zas. and Ripa. in d. L. si quis in fundi.
: or if the names be artificial, not natural, as to use proctorship, for
curatorship Minsing. in. si quidem in nomine. Instit. de lega. n. 2.
.

The error in the body or substance of the Si quis in fundi. de leg. 1. ff.
, like as in the person of the executor or legatarie L. quoties. de haered.
instit. ff.
.

When the error is in the quantity of the L. qui quartam. de leg. 1. ff.
: For example; the testator meaning to bequeath the fourth part of his goods,
does by words bequeath the one half; or meaning to give but fifty pound,
does bequeath an hundred pound: or contrariwise the testator meaning to
bequeath a great quantity or sum, does express a lesser rate or sum Et
sic valet legatum, sieve quantitas sit continua, sieve discreta: vel vt alij
loquuntur, sieve pars sit quotitatiua, sieve numeralis. Ias. and Zas. in d. L.
qui quarta^.
: In these cases the legacy is good, and the legatarie may obtain so much as
the testator did mean, be it more or less then the portion or sum uttered
Bald. Paul. de Castr. Alex. Ias. and Zas. in d. L. qui quartam. quamuis Bar.
contrariam parte^ teneat, casu quo minor summa sit ex pressa, cuius opinio
communiter reprobatur. Et sic valet legatum vtroque casu.
.

Howbeit if the quantity be bequeathed as a certain body: as if the testator
bequeath an hundred pound lying in such a chest, when as there is no money in
the chest, in this case the legacy is void L. si seruus.. si quinque. L. sed
and si certos nummos. ff. de leg. 1. Minsing. in. huic proxima. Instit. de
lega. n. 8. Grass.. legatum. q. 59. n. 3.
. Likewise if the testator do generally bequeath unto another whatsoever he
himself does owe unto that other, the testator not being indebted; the legacy
is void L. si sic.. si mihi. ff. de leg. 1.
. So it is if the testator do say, I do bequeath unto such a man ten pound
which he owes me; in this case also the legacy is void, if the legatarie be
not at all indebted to the testator Minsing. in d.. huic proxima. Instit. de
lega.
. So it is, if the testator do bequeath a certain sum to one, which either
he (the legatarie I mean) or some other does owe unto the testator, when no
such sum is due by either of them to the testator L. si sic.. si mihi. and
Ias. in d..
: for whether the testator did know, or not know, that nothing was due unto
him: in both these cases the legacy is void Paul. de Castr. in d.. si mihi.
and Minsing. in d.. huic proxima.
. So it is, if the testator supposing himself to be indebted to another, does
bequeath that debt to the person to whom he erroniously supposes himself to
be indebted, not expressing any quantity, for the legacy is in this case
void, as is aforesaid d.. si mihi.
. But if the testator knowing himself not to be indebted, does say, I bequeath
to such a person ten pound which I do owe unto him, in this case the legacy is
good, notwithstanding the false demonstration Eod.. si mihi. and Minsing. in.
huic proxima. Instit. de lega. n. 6.
: neither is the testator presumed to err in this case, and therefore unless
the executor make proof of the error, the legatarie may recover the legacy
Castrens. in L. 2. C. de falsa causa adiect.
.

as a certain body, as when the testator does bequeath an hundred pound
lying in such a chest, or which such a person does owe unto him, that then no
money being found in the chest, or nothing being due by that person, the legacy
is void L. si seruus.. si quinque. L. sed and s^certos nummos. ff. de leg. 1.
. This conclusion does admit these limitations: one is when the misreport or
false demonstration is not joined to the substance of the legacy, (as before
Hoc ipso. and before supr. part. 4.. 17. n. 8. etc
) but to the execution thereof: as thus, viz. I give to A.B. an hundred pound,
and I will that the same be paid of the money which I have in such a chest, or
of the money which such a man does owe unto me. For albeit there be not any
money in that chest, nor any due by that person named by that testator,
nevertheless the whole legacy is due, and is to be paid of the testators
goods L. quidam testamento. ff. de leg. 1.
: for the legacy being once pure and simple, and perfect in it self, it is
not made conditional by that which follows, in another sentence respecting
the performance, and not the substance of the legacy, for by such
demonstration the testator is presumed to have had a care only how the
legacy might be paid, the more easily, or with less discommoditie to the
executor, not whether it should be paid at all unto the legatarie d. L.
quidam. and L. paulo. de leg. 3. Bar. Castrens. and alij in d. L. quidam.
.

Another limitation is this, when some part of the legacy consisting in
quantity is extant, though not al, according to the demonstration of the
testator L. si seruus.. si quinque. ff. de leg. 1.
: For example, the testator does bequeath ten pound remaining in such a chest,
at whose death five pound only is found in that chest: In this case
howsoever this legacy be, as of a certain body, yet five pound is due and
recouerable by the legatarie d.. si quinque.
, but no more then five pound: Insomuch that if at the death of the testator
there were ten pound found in that chest, whereas at the time of the making of
the testament there was no more but five pound in the chest: In this case five
pound only is due Paul. de Castr. in d.. quinque. n. 9.
, unless the testator at the will making did think that there had been ten
pound in the chest, and so did add other five pound thereunto, to make the
sum answerable to his opinion, for then the legatarie may recover the whole
ten pound, as if the same had been all there, as well at the making of the
testament, as at the testators death Idem Castrens. in d.. quinque. n 9.
.

And here note, that the testator is presumed to have thought that there had
been ten pound in the chest, like as it is set down in his testament, unless
the executor do prove the contrary, viz. that the testator did know that
there was but five pound in the chest when he made his testament Idem Castr. in
d..
.

quality of the thing bequeathed, does not hurt the legacy, when the body or
substance is certain Angel. in d. L. si quis in fundi. ff. de leg 1.
, no more then the error in the proper name: and therefore if the testator
bequeath his white horse, having but a black horse, the legacy is good Et est
com. op. Ripa. in d. L. si quis in fundi. Grass.. legatum q. 56.
.

form of the disposition, makes the same to be of no force L. quoties
haeres.. tantundem. ff. de haere. instit.
: For example; the testator intending to make an executor, or to bequeath any
legacy conditionally, and not otherwise, does by error omit the condition: In
this case the disposition concerning the executorship or legacy is void d..
tantunde^. and DD; ibidem.

according to certain conditions afterward to be written, no conditions being
afterward written, the disposition is good, and as it were simply made L.

Of uncertainty.
1 Diverse are the means whereby uncertainty does grow.

. vi.
THat we may the better understand when the uncertainty is such, as it does
overthrow the disposition, (for sometimes it does destroy the same, and
sometimes not) we are to be advertised, that the uncertainty does person of
the executor or legatarie Infra. 7.. 8.
: sometimes it does respect the thing bequeathed Infra. 10.
: and sometimes it does respect the time or date of the testament Infra. 11.
.

The testament is uncertain in respect of the person of the executor or
legatarie by diverse means, especially by these means following.

First, when it cannot be understood by whom the testator means, either
for that there is no person certainly named, or else some being named, yet no
person of that name to be found Infra. prox.
.

Secondly, when there be diverse persons of one and the same name, whereby the
testator makes his executor, or does bequeath any legacy Infra. 8.
.

Thirdly, when the testator does appoint executors or give legacies
alternatiuely, or disiunctiuely, as I make A. or B. my executor Infra. 9.
.

Of the other uncertainties; viz. in respect of the thing bequeathed, or date
of the testament, it follows afterward Infra. 10.. 11.
. In the mean time therefore of the uncertainty concerning the person of the
executor or legatarie.

Of uncertainty, either because no certain person is named, or some being
named, none of that name to be found.
1 The uncertainty of the person makes void the disposition.

2 If the person at the first uncertain, be afterward made certain, whether
is the disposition good or no.

3 What if some person be named, but no person found of that name.

testator did more frequent the one then the other: or on the contrary, if both
of them were his parish Churches, for that perhaps he kept a family in either
parish, and did equally frequent either Church: In these cases, by the opinion
of some writers, the legacy is to be divided betwixt the Churches Barba. in d.

nearer of kin greater love, and to him that is further off, lesser: And

inequality of good will, is not presumed toward another kindred, and

Uncertainty arising by reason of alternatiue or disjunctive speech.

to the hearer, of whether person the testator did mean. melius. in d. L. cum

executors A. or B. whom the Ordinary shall choose, or gives an hundred pound

Of uncertainty respecting the thing bequeathed.
1 Whether uncertainty by reason of generality in the thing bequeathed, does
make void the disposition.

THat the disposition or bequest is sometimes overthrown or destitute of
effect, by reason of the uncertainty of the thing bequeathed, may appear by
that which has been already spoken of error in the thing bequeathed Supra.

: For by what means the testator does err, by the same means is his
disposition made uncertain: concerning which kind of uncertainty, whether it
destroy the legacy or no, does there appear. Now therefore of some other
kind of uncertainty respecting the thing bequeathed, and namely whether the
uncertainty growing by occasion of generality, make void the bequest, or not.

a living creature Gloss. and DD. in L. legato. generaliter. and L. si domus.

, and in law genus, then we are to consider, whether the same thing do receive
his limits of nature, as a horse, a tree, etc. or of a man, as a ship, a gold
chain, or of weight, number, or measure, as lead, money wheat Zas. lib. 1.
Sing. respons. in princ. n. 33. Minsing. in d.. si generaliter.

In the first case, viz. if the testator bequeath a horse, the bequest is good,
whether the testator have any or none Bar. Paul. de Castro. and omnes Doctores
in d. L. legato.
.

In the second case, viz. if the testator bequeath a ship, or a gold chain,
by the common opinion of writers, the legacy is void Angel. and Alex. in L.

that the legacy is good, although the testator have no ship, or chain Zas.

: and this opinion seems more reasonable, and more agreeable to the equity
of the ecclesiastical laws Zas. in L. Triticum. and in L. ita stipulatus, de
verb. ob. ff.
, especially if the testator knew that he had no ship, or chain of his own,
when he made his will.

In the third case, viz. if the testator do bequeath lead, or money, or
wheat, not expressing the quantity, the bequest is unprofitable, because of
the great uncertainty: at least it seems the executor is delivered, by
delivering a very little L. nummis. ff. de leg. 3. Gloss. in d. L. legato.
. Howbeit if the legacy consisting in weight, number, or measure, be disposed
for the performance of some act, or other certain consideration, as for the
building of some bridge, or amending of high ways, or for the education or
alimentation of some person, or maintaining him at study, or for the relief
of the poor, or for the repairing of the Church, or for other like uses: In
these cases the legacy is not void, albeit no quantity be expressed: for so
much is understood to be disposed, as may satisfy or answer that purpose,
whereunto it is appointed; and as the ordinary considering the necessity of
the thing, and the ability of the testator, and the continuance of the gift,
shall deem convenient Zas. in L. ita stipulatus. de verb. ob. ff. n. 14. 15.
and Ripa. in eand. L. n. 19. 20. 21. etc.
.

by the equity of the laws ecclesiastical, not only the legacy general of
things consisting in weight, number, or measure, as of wine, of oil, of corn,
of iron, of brass, money, etc. is good and auailable, without any quantity
expressed by the testator, which quantity is understood to be left to the
discretion of the ordinary, to be limited by him as due circumstances Archid.
in c. sunt nonnulli. 1. q. 1. Abb. in c. 1. de dec. extr. gloss. and DD. in c.
nos quide^. de testa. extra.
: but also by the same equity, it seems that the general legacy even of
that which the Logitia^s call genus (which may be verified of things different
in kind) is not void Veluti si animal legatum fuerit Zas. in L. Triticum. ff.
de verb. ob. n. 11. Archid. in c. sunt nonnulli. 1. q. 1.
; but it is to be certified and declared by the Ordinary according to the
estate of persons, the common cause, and whatsoever may be collected by other
circumstances Zas. vbi supra. and in L. si ita stipulatus. ff. de verb. ob. and
ibi Alex. and Ripa.
: much less is the legacy void, where the testator does bequeath a certain
quantity of corn, or wine, or other things consisting in number, weight, or
measure, not expressing the kind of corn, viz. wheat, rye, or barlie; or of
wine, viz. white, secke, or claret Zas. and Ripa. in d. L. si ita stipulatus.
.

who shall choose, where the legacy is general, the executor or legatarie? To
this question thus: If the testator do expressly grant the election, the doubt
is easily answered: he to whom the election is granted Grass. Thesaur. com.
op.. legatum. q. 62. in. prin. Lanc. Dec. and Ias. in l. legato. ff. de leg. 1.
.

If there be no express grant made by the testator, then if the words of
the disposition be directed to the legatarie: as if the testator shall say, I
will that A. B. shall have a horse, the election does belong to the legatarie
Gloss. in L. lucio. ff. de leg. 2. and h^ec opin^o communis est, tes^e Grasso,
d. ^^legatum. q. 62. n. ^.
: but if the words of the disposition be directed to the executor: as if the
testator say, I will that my executor give to A.B. a horse, then the election
does appertain to the executor Couar in c. ^^dican^e. d^ ^e^^a. extr. n. 3.
^as. and a^ij in d L. legato quo^um opinio commua^ est, vt per Gras. vbi supra.
. If the words be neither directed to the executor, nor to the legatarie, it
is answered, that if the thing bequeathed have his limits assigned of nature,
then the election is in the legatarie, in case such things be extant amongst
the testators goods: and in case there be no such extant, the election is in
the executor Gloss. Alex. Ias. Zas. in d. L. legato generaliter. and horum
sententia communis est, ait Grass. d. q. 62. n. 3.
. But if so be that the thing bequeathed be limited by man, the election does

does not appear whether of them is former or later, whether is to be presumed
last, and so of force? I suppose that if they which are to have the

OF imperfect testaments there be two solemnity; the other imperfect in
respect of will L. hac consultissima. ex imperfecto, C. de testa. and ibi Paul.

That testament is said to be imperfect in respect of solemnity, which wants
some of the legal requisites, necessary to the constitution and denomination
of a solemn testament Sichard. and alij. in d.. ex imperfecto.
, of which we have already spoken Supra 1. part.. 7. and part. 4. 23.

That testament is said to be imperfect in respect of will, which the testator
has begun, but cannot finish as he would, being prevented by death, insanitie
of mind, or other impediments Ias. Sichard. and alij, in d.. ex imperfecto. L.

, the testament is good without any such solemnities, saving that where lands,
tenements, and hereditaments be devised by will, the solemnity of a writing in
the life time of the testator, is precisely necessary, without the which the

it is done: which diversity of effects, does arise by the diversity of the
means whereby the testament is imperfect.

If we would therefore know particularly when the testament is utterly void or
not, which is imperfect in respect of will, it behooves us to take particular
view of the several means whereby the will of the testator is made imperfect.

casus. Grass. T^esaur. co^. op. in. testm^. q. 19. vbi proponit tres casus.
: the first is, when the testator after he have begun to make his testament,
and intending to proceed further at that present, is then suddenly even whiles
he is making of his testament, prevented by death, or insanitie of mind, or by
some other impediment, so that he cannot finish the same according to his
purpose L. si is qui de testam. ff. L. furiosum. qui testa. fac. post. C. Ias.

The other mean is, when the testator is not hindered at that present time of
making his testament, but after he haht begun to make his testament, deferreth
the finishing or perfecting thereof until another time, and in the mean time
dies, or otherwise becomes intestable Oldrad. consil. 119. Paul. de Castr.

Iul. Clar.. testm^. q. 9. and Michael. Grass. Thesa. com. op.. testm^. q. 12.
. But whether it be void iure gentium, and consequently by that law which we
use here in England, is a question not altogether undoubtful: and the
resolution seems to depend upon the verity of another question: namely,
whether a testament ad pias causas being imperfect with that imperfection of
will, be good or not: For if a testament ad pias causas be good,
notwithstanding such imperfection, then our testaments are also good: and if
that testament be not good; then ours are likewise naught: for these
testaments ad pias causas, are ruled secundum ius gentium Panor. in Rub de

: their reason is, because in this case here is defect of consent, without
which consent no testament is good Sichard. in d.. ex imperfecto.
. There is defect (say they) of consent in this case, because testators whiles
they are making of their testaments, until they have finished the same, do
put in, and put out, they add, they revoke, and they alter many things
already by them disposed Clar.. testm^. q. 7.
: Other reasons also they have, the which in my opinion are not altogether so
forceable Nempe quod testm^. ratione voluntatis imperfectum. non valet inter

On the contrary, others whose not only number is more exceeding, but
authority and estimation more excellent, are of this opinion, that where the
testator has begun his testament, and has bequeathed certain legacies ad
pias causas, and intending at that present to proceed further, is then suddenly
by death or other impediment prevented, or hindered, that he cannot finish his
testament: nevertheless those legacies already made ad pias causas, are not
thereby infringed, but do continue still firm and effectual, as if the
testator had finished his testament, according to his former purpose Bar. and

, and this their opinion is testified to be more commonly received Tiraquel.
Tract. de priuileg. piae causae. priuileg. 7. Mascard. de probac. verb. testm^.
. The reason of their opinion is, because touching those legacies already
given, there is no defect of natural consent Panor. in d. c. 1. de success. ab
intestat. extra.
: For although there be imperfection of will in respect of his whole
testament, because the testator cannot absolutely finish the same according to
his purpose: yet in respect of that which is done, there is no imperfection of
will Tiraquel. de priuileg piae cause. e. priuileg. 7. Dec in c. 1. de fide
instr. extr.
(the perfect is not to be hurt by the imperfect c. vtile. de reg, iu^. extra.
) And albeit testators whiles their wills and testaments are in making do
many times add and diminish, and alter diverse things, yet who is able to say
that concerning this, or that particular legacy already given, the testator
would have made any addition, diminution, or alteration: The presumption is
rather to the contrary, for perseverance and not mutation of will is presumed
L. cum qui volunta tem. ff. de probac.
. In deed if it can be proved that the testator did mean at that present to
alter those legacies before given ere he had finished his testament and could
not, being then suddenly prevented by death, or otherwise, then the former
opinion has place Paul. de Castr. in L. iubemus. de testa. and DD. in L. pen.
de Instit. and sub. C.
, that the disposition is void, otherwise not Quia nemo praesumitur habere
plus in cord quam in ore. Bald. in L. si is qui. ff. de testa.
.

By this now which has been spoken of ad pias causas, we may judge whether
our testaments here in England be good or not, when they be inperfect by the
first means, viz. where the testator whiles he is in making his testament,
after he have appointed an executor, or given some legacies, and intending to
proceed further, is even then suddenly interrupted and hindered, that he cannot
finish the same accordingly.

When the testament is imperfect by the an other time, and in the mean time
dies, or is otherwise let, that he cannot make an end thereof, as he meant,
howsoever by the rigor of the civil law the testament in this case may seem
to be void, eue^ touching that which is already done Paul. de Castr. consil.
150. vol. 2.
: yet by that law which this realm of England does admit, in this case (I
mean ius gentium) concerning those things already disposed, the testament is
not void by the reasons before alleged. For as in the former case the
legacies already given are not void, where the testator cannot finish his
testament as he would at that time: so in this case, the legacies before
disposed, or the constitution of the executor before made, does not become
void, where the testator cannot finish his testament as he purposed at another
time Cum igitur eadem ratio in vtroque casu militet, idem etiam ius constitui
oportet. Nec casus diuersitas, sed rationis identidas inspici debet Aymo

op.. testm^. q. 12. n. 4. quam sententiam communiter receptam monstrat. post

. Wherefore if the testator after that he has made his will, do say that he
will add, diminish, or alter any thing in his will the next day, and die in the
mean time, before any such additions, detractions, or alterations be made, the
testament is not to be noted of imperfection by any such reservation of adding,
diminishing, or altering his testament Simo. de Praetis. de Interp. vlt. vol.
lib. 1. fol. 195. Io. de Ana. cons. 44
; because these things may be don by way of codicill, without the which the
testament is sufficiently perfect Sichard. in L. pen. de Instit. and sub. C. in
sin.
, and especially the testament remains firm and effectual, where the
testator does ouer-liue the time by him prescribed for such additions,
diminutions, or alterations, for then he is presumed to have repented him of
such additions, by not doing the same when he might Alex. cons. 74. vol. 1.

: nevertheless, if it may be proved, that the testator did restrain himself
to the written testament, and that it was his will and meaning, that the
testament should not be of force, unless it were written, then the testator
dies in the mean time before it be written, the testament shall not be
allowed as a Nuncupatiue testament, and so not at all Bar. post Din, in L. vlt.

testament does not in any wise dissent from the former, but agrees with the

opinion is truer, or more commonly received. Others laboring to reconcile

testaments Clar. Grass. Couar. vbi supra. DD. in d.. in legatis.
: Example of the first is, when the testator uses these or the like words: I
do from henceforth renounce the power of making any other testament: Or thus;
I will that hereafter I have no more liberty or authority to make mo wills
or testaments, etc. Example of the second; when the testator uses these or the
like words: If I make any testament hereafter, I will that the same be of no
force: or thus; If I make any testament hereafter, except therein I write the
Lords prayer, my mind and will is that the same be void and of none effect
DD. in d.. in legatis. Couar. in d. Rub. Clar. and Grass. vbi supr.
. The use of this distinction or difference betwixt clauses derogatorie of
power and of will is this.

If the clause be derogatorie of the power of making of testaments, and
afterward the testator makes another testament, it is not needful therein to
make any mention, or reuocation of the former testament, or clause derogatorie
therein contained Bar. in L. si quis in prin. de leg. 3. Ias. in d. in legatis.
Clar.. testm^ q. 99. n. 2. Grass.. testm^. q. 89. n. 3.
, for the former is taken away by the second, as if there had not been any such
clause derogatorie therein at all: the reason is, because the clause
derogatorie of the power of making testaments is utterly void in law, neither
can a man renounce the power or liberty of making testame^ts Bar. d. L. si
quis. n. 4. Clar. and Grass vbi supr.
, neither is there any cautele under heaven to prevent this liberty Bar in d..

vlt. vol. lib. 12. tit. 1. n. 1.
, which also indureth whiles any life endures L. 4. ff. de adimen. legatis.
, as has been aforesaid.

If the clause be derogatorie of the testators will, then it is necessary that
in the later testament there be mention or reuocation of the testament with the
clause derogatorie, otherwise the former testament is still in force Bar. in L.
si quis. de legatis. 3. Clar. testm^. q. 99. Grass.. testm^. q 89.
: the reason is, because there is presumed a defect of the testators will in
the second testament, and that his meaning is not to have the former revoked,
without making mention of the former derogatorie testament Couar. in d. Rub. de
testa. extra. part. 2. Clar. and Grass. vbi supra Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol.

will, is not infringed by the later testament, wherein is no mention or
reuocation of the former testament derogatorie, for it fails in diverse cases.

testators meaning, that the former testament should be revoked Couar. in d.

testament Bald. in L. sancimus. C. de testa n. 6. Grass. d. q. 89. n. 10. Clar.

testament Bald. in d. L. sancimus in fin. Grass. d. q. 89. n. 8. Clar. d. q.

For the other question, (viz. what manner of reuocation is to be made in the
second testament, that it may suffice to revoke the former testament, wherein
is a clause derogatorie of the will of general, another special, the third
singular, or individual Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. testm^ q. ^9. n. 4. Clar..

. General, when the testator in his later testament uses these or the like
words: I will that this testament shall stand, notwithstanding any other will
or testament by me heretofore made: or thus; I revoke and make void all former
wills and testaments, etc. Special when the testator has these or the like
terms. I do hereby revoke all former testaments, notwithstanding any clause
derogatorie in the same. Singular, wherein the testator says, I make my last
will and testament, notwithstanding that clause derogatorie of my former will,
that I would not have that testament revoked, unless I should insert in this
testament the Lords prayer. Or thus: Notwithstanding that clause derogatorie
in my former will, whereby I would that no will or testament afterward to be
made should prevail, albeit I should specially derogate from the former. Or
thus: Notwithstanding that will where I made such a person my executor. Or thus:
Notwithstanding that will which I made in such a place, at such a time, and
before such witnesses, etc Bar, in L. si quis in prin. ff. de leg. 3. Couar. in

. These distinctions observed, I make these conclusions.

The first conclusion is, that if in the later general reuocation, as
notwithstanding all former testaments, etc. the former testament wherein is a
clause derogatorie of the testators will, is not thereby taken away Bar. in d.
L. si quis. Socin. Iun. in eand. L. n 24. Grass. Thesau. com. op. testm^. and

.

The second conclusion is, that if in the special reuocation, as
notwithstanding any testamentes with their clauses derogatorie, etc. the former
testament with the clauses derogatorie of the testators will is thereby taken
away ^y. in c. quod semel de reg iur. 6. Alex. d. L. sancimus. Clar.. testa^.

.

singular reuocation of the former testament, as notwithstanding such a
testament made before such a Notarie, etc. the same former testament having
therein a general clause derogatorie, is sufficiently revoked, although in the
second testament there be no mention of the clause derogatorie in the former
testament Bar. in. d. L. si quis. n. 8. Couar. in d. Rub. de testa. extr. n.

I might add, but I thought good to deliver this one for all, the Simo de
Praetis. de Interp. vlt. vol. lib. 4. fol 227. n. 60. etc.
, etc. For if the testator do understand the effect of such clauses
derogatorie, and did insert the same wittingly and willingly of his own
accord, it is presumed that he did so, least peradventure afterward he might
be solicited and induced by the instigation and importunity of his kinsfolks,
or the molestation of some other, receiving small benefit by the testament,
and hoping to gain more by the alteration or reuocation thereof, to change or
revoke the same, contrary to his former settled purpose, and firm resolution.
In which case, if at any time after the testator make a new testament, the
former is not easily revoked Paris. consil. 10. lib. 3. n. 10. 11. etc.
, unless in the second he do make mention and reuocation of the former
testament, with the clause derogatorie Simo. de Praetis. de Interp. vlt. vol.
lib. 4. fol. 227. n. 61. etc.
, in cases where reuocation is necessary, as in the former conclusions is
prescribed: otherwise the said form not observed, it is to be presumed, that
it is not the testators meaning to infringe and frustrate his former testament,
made with such constant resolution, Simo. de Praetis. vbi supra.
. But on the contrary, if the testator were but a simple person, not
understanding the effect of such derogatorie, or reuocatorie clauses, and the
rather if the same clauses were inserted in the former testament by the
Notarie, at the petition or by the direction of such as were benefited by the
same testament, or some of their friends, being loath to have the same altered
or revoked: then howsoever the former testament be corroborated with cunning or
precise clauses, of inserting the lords prayer in the second testament, or of
not reuoking the former testament, although in the second he should specially
revoke the same: all these cunning clauses and curious cautions
notwithstanding, the former testament may be the more easily revoked, without
any such precise observation of special reuocation above described Idem Simo
de Praetis. loco superius allegato, vbi locupletissime de hac re. Cui adijcias

.

Thus we have seen in what cases the former testament is infringed or not
infringed by the last testament. If any do here demand of a little before

AN other of those means whereby the testament which was good at the
beginning, is afterward made void, is reuocation of the same testament. For as
it is lawful for every testator to add Bald. in L. sancimus. C. de testam.

concurring, viz. the long time, the increase of the testators wealth, and the
prejudice of such as are to have the administration of the testators goods, the
testament is not presumed to be revoked Paul. de Castr. Ias. and Alex. vbi

. An other case is, when the testator in heat of anger or displeasure conceived
without just cause against his son, or other persons, to whom the
administration of his goods were to be committed, if he had died intestate,
making his testament in favor of others and afterward (the heat of his
displeasure being extinguished) they be reconciled: for by this reconciliation,
the testament is presumed to be revoked L. filium. de inoff. testo^. Hyero.

. The third case is, when the testator has begun to make his testament, but is
let or hindered by the executor that he cannot proceed as he would to the
finishing of the testament, or further disposing of other legacies: For in this
case the will of the testator is presumed to be revoked L. si scriptis. ff. de

. The fourth case is, when the testator being extremely sick, and afraid to
die, does bequeath some legacy ad pias causas, and after does recover his
health: for there the legacy is also presumed to be revoked Bar. in rep. L. 1.
C. de sacrosanct. eccles. n. 41. Repertor. Bertachin. verb. testm^ reuocatur.
n. 47.
. It may seem strange, that legacies left to good and godly uses should be
revoked, rather then other profane legacies, but I take the reason to be, for
that it is presumed that the testator did not intend to give legacies to so
good an use in that extremity, but in case he should die of that sickness,
and so not dying, the legacy is revoked Bar. and Bertachin. vbi supra.
.

It is a question appertaining to the reuocation I revoke my former testament,
or I will that my former testament be of no force?

Many writers are of this opinion, that the because I will die intestate Bar.

.

Others are of a contrary opinion, esteeming that it is sufficient to make a
bare reuocation without any express mention of dying intestate Bald. in L.
sancimus. C. de testa. Socin. Iun. consil. 145. asserens ha^c sententiam

considerationem Bartoli esse Truffam.
. And this opinion in my understanding is more sound, and more reasonable: for
whiles the testator will not have his testament to stand, it follows that it
is his will and meaning to die intestate Alex. co^sil. 104. vol. 2.
, and so the next of kin to be called to the administration of his goods.
Besides it seems absurd and unreasonable to maintain a testament, not only
without a man's will, but even against his will Mantic. d. lib. 2. tit. 15. n.
22.
, at least within this realm of England, where we do not observe the
solemnities of the civil law: this opinion is to be preferred; for even by the
civil law, legacies are taken away by a simple and naked reuocation L. 3. ff.

: and so be diverse testaments; those I mean wherein those solemnities are
not necessary, as testame^ts ad pias causas Alex post Bald. d. consil. 104.

reuocation, so ought our testaments to be measured with the same line, and to
enjoy like liberty, as well in the dissolution, as in the constitution Co^sulas

The second case is, when the testator after he have wittingly and willingly

The third case is, when the whole testament is not cancelled or defaced, but
some part thereof only raced, blotted, or put out, for the other parts of the
testament do remain firm and safe L. proxime.. se^te^tia ff. de his quae in

The fourth case is, when there be several papers or writings of one tenure,
each of them containing the whole testament, the defacing or cancelling of some
of them does not hurt the testament L. pluribus. ff. de his quae in testato.

, unless it be proved that the testators mind was contrary d. L. pluribus.

The fifth case is, when the testament is lost, either in the life time of the
testator, or after, for so much as may be proved by witnesses, is still in
force L. 1. sed consulto. ff. de his quae in testato. del. cum gloss. ibid.
.

What if the testament be found cancelled

It seems not to be reputed the act of the testator Zas. consil. 2. lib. 1.
, for mutation or change of the mind is not to be presumed L. eum qui. ff. de
probac.
, especially after a man has done a thing with such deliberation and
resolution, wherewith testaments commonly are made and finished Supr. 1. part..
3. verb sententia. and hac ipsa part paulo superius, viz.. 13.
.

On the contrary, it seems that it ought not to be accounted the act of any
other Io. Fa^er. in. ex eo. Instit. quib. mod. testa. infir. Peckius. de testa.
coniug. lib. 1 c. 46. n. 1.
; for that were to presume fraud and deceit in men which ought not to be
presumed, unless it be proved L. dolum. C. de dolo.
.

In this controversy therefore I suppose that the person in whose custody the
testament is found so cancelled or defaced, is to be adjudged to have done the
act, whether it be the testator or another DD. in L. si vnus. C de testa.
Mantic. de co^iect. vlt. vol. lib. 12. tit. 1. n. ^0.
.

And if it be so that the testament were kept in such a place, as not only the
testator, but others might have access unto it: In this case the arguments and
circumstances of the fact being equal and indifferent, the cancelling or
defacing of the testament, is rather to be ascribed to the testator then to
others Zas. d. consil. 2. vol. 1. n. 1. and n. 15. Faber. in. ex eo. Instit.
quib. mod. testa. infir.
, who is also presumed to have done the same wittingly and willingly Paul. de
Castr. in L. 1.. sed consulto. ff. de his quae in testo^. del.
: saving in legacies of freedom, or ad pias causas, which being blotted or put
forth by the testator, it is not presumed to have been done willingly Paul.
de Castro, in d.. Tiraquel. de pia causa. priuileg. 16. Ma^tic. de coniect.
vlt. vol. lib. 12. tit 2. n. 25.
. But when the arguments and circumstances be unequal, and the greater
presumptions that it should be the act of another rather then of the testator,
it is to be adjudged accordingly Zas. d. consil. 2. n. 15. 16. 17. 18. etc.
: for the fewer and weaker presumptions give place to the more and stronger c.

, but especially when the testator is convicted or condemned of such a crime,
after the making of his testament, for the which the law depriueth him of this
power and ability of making a testament d.. alio. and ibi gloss. and DD.
.

What manner of crimes they be, whereby the state of the testator is so altered,
that thereby he is made intestable, is above expressed De quibus sigillatim.
supra part. 2. and part. 5.
, to wit heresy, apostasy, treason, felony, sodomie, incest, manifest
usury, and such like: whereunto also I might add captivity L eius qui apud
hosts. ff de testa. supr. part. 2.. 8.
, not for that captivity is a crime, but for that it has the same effect with
those crimes, to overthrow the testament. But if the captive recover his
former liberty, then the testament made before the captivity recouereth his
former force. non tamen Instit. quib. mod. testa. infir.
. And if he that is convicted or attainted of treason, or felony, obtain the
princes pardon, with restitution to his former state, then the testament made

; and in both cases the testament is good, without any new confirmation or
declaration Quod verum quide^ est in capitis diminutione necessaria, secus in

. Howbeit in this they differ; for the testament of the person which recouereth
his former liberty, is good even from the beginning, as if he had never been
in captivity Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. testm^. q. 25.
: but his testament whose crime is pardoned, and himself restored, is of force
only from the time of restitution Ioh. Platea. in d.. no^ tamen.
. Again, if the pardon do only import a remission of the penalty, without
restitution of his former estate, then the testament before made does still
remain void Minsinger. in d.. non tamen.

, when it receives his strength and efficacy (as for the time betwixt the
making of the testament, and the death of the testator, it skilleth not whether
the testator have any such power or not d. non tamen. and Minsing. ac alij ibid.
:) and therefore if any person being attainted of some crime, do whilst he is
intestable make his testament, and afterward obtain a full pardon, with full
restitution, the testament nevertheless is void, because of the original
defect Aretin. in d.. non tamen. Simo de Praetis. de Interp. vlt. vol. lib. 1.

Of forbidding or hindering the testator to make an other testament.
1 The former testament is void, where the testator is forbidden to alter the
same, or to make a new testament.

2 Diverse extensions of this foresaid conclusion.

3 Of hindering the Notarie or witnesses to have access to the testator.

4 Of disturbing the testator by making a noise.

5 Of immodest persuasions.

6 Whether this prohibition be proved by the assertion of the testator.

7 Diverse limitations of the first conclusion, viz. that the testament is
overthrown, where the testator is hindered in altering the same.

8 Of disturbing the testator with noise and weeping.

9 Whether the prohibition of one be prejudicial to others.

. xviij.
Amongst many other means whereby the testament which was good at the
beginning, is afterward made void, this is one not to be omitted, (seeing it
is so often practiced) namely when the testator intending to alter the
testament Tit. si quis alique^ testari prohib. ff. and C.
. By this prohibition and manner of crooked dealing, the testament which should
have been altered is made void L. 1. and 2. ff. si quis aliquem testari

.

The reason is, because as those testaments are not found at the beginning
which are made by fear or fraud Supr. ead. part. 2. and 3.
: so that testament which for fear, or by fraud the testator dare not, or
cannot alter, is from henceforth infected with the same disease, and so from
henceforth to be esteemed of no more force or efficacy then these other

. And therefore if the wife being made executrix, or any other person benefited
by the testament, understanding that the testator is about to alter ^is will,
will not suffer his friends to come unto him, pretending peradventure that he
is fast asleep, or in a slumber, or the Physician gave in charge, that none
should come to him Peckius. Tract. de testa. coniug. lib. 1. c. 13
, or pretending some other excuse, (or else all excuses set apart, do for
charities sake shut them forth of the doors Vt est apud Teren. prae amore

prohibition might very well at sundry times have altered his testament, and
did not Mar. Socin. Iun. con. sil. 148. n. 48. vol. 2. Paris. consil 67. n. 62.

. The fifth case is, when the testator is not compelled by fear, nor
circumuented by fraud, but induced with flattering speeches void of deceit,
(such as may become an honest wife, or faithful friend) not to alter his
testament Menoch. d. cas. 395. n 42. per L. vlt. ff. si qui^ aliquem testari

. Howbeit the judge must be very wary, and learn by the circumstances of the
fact, whether this noise and exclamation be of Menoch. d. cas. 395. n. 39.
. The seventh case is, when the executor or legatarie does forbid or hinder
the testator to alter his testament, in which case the former testament is
void, only in prejudice of that person, which does prohibit or hinder the
testator to alter the same, but not in prejudice of another not co^senting
thereunto L. 2. si quis aliquem testa. prohib. ff.
: much less does the prohibition of that person, who is to reap no benefit
by the testament, hurt those executors which otherwise should be
administrators, in case the party died intestate Menoch. d. cas. 395. n. 20.
post Bar. in L. vltim. si quis aliquem testari prohib. ff n. 11.
, unless it does appear that the testator would have changed his whole
testament, and have appointed new executors, for then this prohibition makes
void the whole testament, like as if the testator had been compelled to make
the same at the first Bar. in d. L. vlt. Menoch. d. cas. 395. n. 17. Paris.
consil. 67. vol. 3.
.

There is much adoo in the civil law about this question* who ought to have
the testators goods, when he is compelled to make his testament, or hindered
that he can not revoke his testament, the prince or the heirs of the dead
person De qua q. Menoch. de arb. iud. cas. 395.
? But with us if any die intestate, the administration of his goods is to be
committed to the widow, or next of kin Stat. H. 8. an. 21. c. 5.
, and does not go to the prince though the executor or legatarie be unworthy.

When he that is made executor can not, or will not be executor.
1 Though the executor be incapable, the legacies are still due.

2 The executor ought to be capable of the executorship at three several times.

3 It is sufficient for the legatarie, if he be capable of the legacy at the
testators death.

4 What if the disposition be conditional.

, or did manifest his meaning by other equivalent conjectures, without which
proof of such the testators meaning, the legacy is so surely extinguished,

same, or to make it bigger Ias. in d. L. si ita.. vlt de lega. 1. ff. n. 13. in

form, it is not the same but another house Iidem Castreus. Ias. and Mascard.

What if the house bequeathed be blown Ias. in L. domos. ff. de leg. 1. n. 1.

ground whereon the house did stand, should belong to the legatarie L. si grege
legato. ff. de leg. 1. in fin. Paul. de Castr. in d.. si domus. verb. sed ponc.
and ibi Ias. n. 2. and 7.
. Seeing then the ground is the legataries, it follows that the house is the
legataries also L. si seruum filij.. si a cae. ff. de leg. 1. Ias. and Paul. de
Castr. vbi supr
. Howbeit the author of this opinion in another place is of another opinion
Ias. in L. domus. ff. de leg 1. n. 13.
, which opinion is also commended of other writers, as more agreeable to law
Mascard. Tract. de probac conclus. 1280. n. 27. and Mantic. de coniect. vlt.
vol. lib. 12. tit. 2. n. 6.
, because this house is another house then that which was bequeathed. And
again, the text of the civil law is plain, that the house bequeathed being
destroyed, if the testator build another in the same place, the legacy is
extinguished, unless the meaning of the testator were otherwise Text. in d. si
domus.
. Seeing then, the text does not distinguish of the means whereby the house
is destroyed, neither may we Mas^^. and Mantic. vbi sup
.

To the former reason that the ground had ergo the house also: It is answered,
that if it were granted (which of diverse is denied) that the ground should be
ong to the legatarie Raph. Cu. Petr. de Bexu. in d.. si domus, and ibi Ias. n.
13.
, yet should it not belong unto him as principal, but as accessarie, or part
of the house bequeathed Bar. Paul. de Castr. Ias. in d.. si domus.
: and therefore being but accessarie, it does not receive any other access or
augmentation Iidem Bar. Ias. and Paul. de Castr. vbi supr.
. How be it, forasmuch as these questions about houses devised by will,
afterward destroyed, and then reedified, are rather to be determined by the
laws of this realm, then by the civil law: I do willingly yield the matter
into their hands, to whom it principally apperteineth.

TRanslation of a legacy is a bestowing Minsing. in tit. de ademp. lega. Inst.

or condicionally: so may translation of legacies likewise Tit. de ademp. leg.
Instit. L. translatio. eod. tit. ff. and DD. ibid.
.

A legacy being transferred from one to another, the legacy is taken away
from the former L. plane.. 1. de leg. 1. L. and si transferam de adim. leg. ff.
: for howsoever that act is said not to minister impediment, which is
altogether without effect c. non praestat. de reg. iur. ^.
, yet forasmuch as by this translation it does appear to be the testators
will and meaning, first to have the legacy taken away from the former
legatarie: this will and meaning ought to be observed, so far as it may
Minsing. in d. tit. de ademp. leg. n. 6.
, and ought not therefore to be hindered in one thing, because it cannot be
performed in Bar. Ias. and alij, in d. L plane.
. For as I said before, every translation does presuppose and include an
ademption Caeterum an translatio sit expressa vel tacita primi legati
reuocatio, quaestio est cui no^ eod^m modo respondent omnes: Tu autem videas
Couar. in Rub. de testa. extra. 2. part. n 21.
, except in certain cases following. The first case is, when the testator in
the time of great and extreme sickness, transferring a legacy, or bestowing
the same upon an other, does afterward recover his health: for by this
recovery the translation is void, and the former legacy confirmed L. Titia..
vlt. de adimen. leg. ff. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 12. tit. 3. n. 2.
. Another case is, when the testator having bequeathed a legacy to one, and
having provided that if the legatarie will not do such a thing to another
person, that then that other person shall have the legacy: In this case if the
former legatarie be prevented by death, that he cannot perform the condition
though he would, the second legatarie cannot obtain the legacy L sancimus C.
le paenis. Ias. in L. cum proponas. C. de h^^red. in^^^t. and Mantic. de
coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 12. tit. 3. n. 2.
. The third case is, when the legacy does consist in quantity; as when the
testator does bequeath to one man an hundred pound, and immediately after to
another man an hundred pound: here is neither translation nor ademption of the
former legacy, but two several legacies L. plane.. 1. de leg. 1. L. paulo. in
prin. de leg. 3. ff.
. But yet if the testator do limit this sum to some certain body, as if the
testator bequeath to one man an hundred pound which lies in his chest; then it
is all one as if he said, he did bequeath his signet, his books, or his
armor, whereof we shall have occasion to speak shortly after Infra hoc ipso.
n. 7. 11.
.

Furthermore, it is to be noted in this place, L. Gaio. ff. de alime^. and cib.
leg. L. legatum. de adimen. ^eg. Paul de Castr. consil. 327. vol. 1.
: For example; the testator gives to one person an hundred pound, charging him
to destribute ten shillings yearly amongst the poor during ten years:
afterward the testator does bestow that hundred pound upon an other person,
without mention of any such yearly destribution: In this case the second
legatarie is charged with the yearly payment and distribution of ten
shillings, even as the former legatarie Bar. in d. L. Gaio. M^ntic, de coniect.
vlt. vol. lib. 12. tit. 3. n. 3.
: neither can he accept the one part of the legacy without the other L.
legatarius.. si legatum. de leg. 1.
: saving in certain d. L. Gai^.
. Another case is, when the condition is such, as the same does cleave to the
person of the former legatarie L. legatum sub condition. de adimen. leg. L.
legatum sub condition. de condict. and demon. ff.
: For example; the testator does bequeath to a woman with child an hundred
pound, if she be delivered of a boy: this condition does cleave to the person
of the former legatarie, and so is not transferred with the legacy d. L.
legatum sub co^ditio. de adim. legate. and ibi DD.
. The third case is, when the translation is made to the same person, without
mention of any further charge or condition: for then least the second bequest
should seem superfluous, it is thought to be the meaning of the testator, by
the second bequest to give the same simply L. si tibi. de adimen. leg. ff.
. The fourth case is, when in the translation of the legacy, there is a new
special charge imposed upon the second legatarie: for then the old charge
imposed to the former legatarie is presumed to be remitted, least otherwise the
later legatarie should be pressed with a double charge L. Alumne. de adime^.

.

What if the testator after he have given a legacy to one person, do
afterward bequeath the same to another person, whether is this an ademption
of the former legacy, or whether ought both the legataries to concur, and to
have the legacy betwixt them.

For answer, we are to consider, whether some special and certain thing is
bequeathed, or a thing consisting in quantity.

In the former case, namely when some special or certain thing is bequeathed;
it is material whether the legacy be of lands, tenements, or hereditaments,
and so the question determinable in the temporal court, according to the laws
temporal of this land, are of goods, and so the controversy to be decided in
the ecclesiastical court, according to the laws ecclesiastical of this
realm. If of lands, tenements, and hereditame^ts, as when the testator (for
example) does in the former part of his will, devise his lands in such a place
to one in fee, and afterward in the later part of the same will, to another
person in fee: it seems by the laws of this realm, that the later part does
overthrow the former Plowd. in cas. inter Paramor and Yardley. fol. 541.
. And that as the later testament does destroy the former testament: Eade^
enim est ratio partis ad partem, atque totius ad totum. Euerard. loc. top. a
toto ad partem.
so the later part of a testament, does infringe the former part of the same
testament, when it is contrary thereunto: nevertheless I will not presume to
affirm, that this conclusion is undoubtedly certain, but with due submission
surrender the same, to be discussed by the learned in the laws temporal, unto
whom it rightly appertains.

If the devise be of goods; as when the testator does bequeath his signet, his
books, or his horse, etc. First to one person, and afterward to another
person: then in case the second legacy be simple, (I mean without mention of
the former) the former legacy is not taken away, but the two legataries
concurring, ought to divide the legacy betwixt them Paul. de Castro. Ias. and
Zas. in L. si pluribus. ff. de leg. 1. Ripa. in L. re coniu^cti. n. 21. de leg
3.
. The reason and foundation whereupon this conclusion is builded, is the
testators constancy, wherein the civil law does repose such confidence, that
when he has once bequeathed a thing, he is not presumed to take the same away
d. L. si pluribus. verb. si quidem euidentissime.
, without evident presumption Raph. Cum. in d. L. si pluribus. and ibi Ias. n.
12. and 13. and zas. n. 14. qui omnes tenent sufficere coniecturalem

vel ex coniecturis emergens, dicitur euidentissima, in translatione legatorum.
Ias. vbi supra. post Bar. in L. si constante. ff. sol. ma. n. 12.
of the alteration of his former resolution. Insomuch that if one and the same
thing be left to one person in the testament, and to another in the codicill,
yet is not the testator presumed so variable, as utterly to take away the
former legacy, but rather that both the legataries are to concur, and so to
divide the legacy betwixt them Bald. in L. cohaeredi.. cohaeres. in fin. de
vulg. and pup. sub. ff. Alex. consil. 169. vol. 5. Mantic. de coniect. vlt.
vol. lib. 12. tit. 2. n. 3.
. Where it is said that as the later testament does destroy the former
testament: so likewise the later part of the testament, does overthrow the
former part thereof: That is true, when it is evident that the testator did
mean it should be so d. L. si pluribus. and ibi DD. Mantic. de coniec. vlt.
vol. lib. 12. tit. 2. n. 3. in fin.
: But if it be doubtful, then without all doubt we ought to labor diligently
to save the testament from co^tradiction Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 3.
tit. 5. in fin. Socin. Iun. consil. 125. vol. 1. n. 5.
, and not suffer one part to fight and brawle with another; much less to
permit one part to kill and destroy another, in case there be any place for
peace, or hope of reconciliation to be had betwixt them. Again, the argument
is not of equal force, a part ad partem, with the argument a toto ad totum,
in case there be inequality or diversity of reason betwixt the one and the
other Euerard. d. loco, a toto ad partem. n. 7. post Cyn. and alios legu
interpretes. in L. cum notissimi.. in his. C. de praescrip. 30. ann.

destroy the former part, whereas neither part does receive any life before the
other Bar. in L. si quis. ff. de testa. L. ex ea scriptura. eod. tit.

senseless parts of an imperfect creature, or confused embrio d L ex ea

: Like as they do receive their strength all at one moment, namely at the death

If the second bequest be qualified with mention of the former: for example;
the testator says, my signet which I bequeathed to A.B. I bequeath to C. D.
whether in this case the former legacy be quite taken away, or in part, is a
question wherein the writers do greatly vary Id quod patet per Mantic. de

lib 3.. 23. n. 96. etc. and per Doctores, in L. plane. and L. si pluribus. ff.
de leg. 1.
: but the greater number incline to this opinion, that the former legacy is
not wholly taken away, but that they are both joint legataries Bar. in L. re
coniuncti. ff. de leg. 3. cuius opinionem frequentiori calculo receptam
monstrat nobis Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 12. tit. 4. n. 1. et refert
Grass. Thesaur. com. op. legatu^. q. 180.
, except in certain cases. One is when it may appear (at least by conjectures)
that it was the testators meaning to take away the legacy from the former
legatarie wholly. Bar. in d. L. re coniuncti. Mantic. d. tit. 4. n. 8. Grass.
d.. legatu^. q. 80. n. 2.
. Another is, when the second bequest is not made in the same testament, but
after in some codicill Ripa. in d. L. re coniuncti. n. 23. de leg. 3. ff.
Mantic. d. tit. 4. n. 10.
. Another case is, when the testator in the second disposition says, that
which I did bequeath to A.B, I give to C. D: for this word give, is of such
force, that it seems wholly to take away the former legacy Couar. in Rub. de

.

In the second case, that is to say, when the legacy does consist in
quantity, if the testator do bequeath to one man an hundred pound, and
immediately to another man an other hundred pound: here is neither translation,
nor ademption, but two several legacies; and either legatarie in this case
shall recover an hundred pound Atque haec conclusio sine contradictione vera
est. Minsing. in. transferri. Instit. de ademp. leg. n. 8.
, as I have showed before. Where also I signified, that if the testator do
restrain this quantity to a certain body, as to the hundred pound sealed up
in such a bag, then it is reduced to that case of bequeathing a certain
special thing, as the testators signet, first to one; and then to another L.
plane.. si eadem. de leg. 1. ff. verb. sed hoc ita. and Zas. eod.. n. 3. verb.
sed finge.
.

If the testator do bequeath to one man an hundred pound, and afterward in
the same testament bequeatheth to the same man an hundred pound; the second
disposition is understood to be but a repetition of the former, and all but one
legacy Gloss. in d. L. plane.. 1. and ibi Ias. n. 11. and Zas. n. 14. Michael.

two hundred pound Tunc enim saepius praestanda est summa, si modo

: or unless an unequal quantity be given to the same legatarie; as if the
testator do bequeath in one part of his testament an hundred pound, and in
another part fifty pound: for in this case the legatarie may recover an
hundred and fifty pound L. cum centum. de adimen. leg. ff. Ias. in d. 1.

Of diverse means vvereby legacies are lost, considerable in the legatarie.
1 By what means he that is named executor is made incapable of the
executorship, by the same means does the legatarie lose his legacy.

2 The legacy is lost by reason of enimitie betwixt the testator and the
legatarie.

3 Diverse extensions of this conclusion.

4 What if the testator were the cause of the enimitie, and the legatarie in no
fault.

5 Certain cases wherein the legacy is not lost by reason of enimitie.

6 The legatarie being appointed tutor, loses his legacy, if he refuse the
tutorship.

7 The legatarie, if he accuse the testament of falsitie, loses his legacy.

8 The legatarie which does cancel the testament, does loose his legacy.

9 The legatarie does loose his legacy, who of his own authority does take
and possess the thing bequeathed.

.

Secondly, the former conclusion has place, albeit the testator were ignorant
of the injury done unto him by the legatarie, when it is such an injury, for
the which it is very likely that the testator would have revoked his legacy,
if he had known thereof: as if the legatarie have committed adultery with the
testators wife, or have deflowred his daughter Gloss. in L. fideicommissum. C.

his legacy L. filio.. scia. ff. de adimen. leg.
.

Fifthly, he which becomes capital enemy to the testators brother, loses
his legacy Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 12. tit. 5. n. 8.

Sixthly, albeit the testator himself were Mantic. d. tit. 5. n. 9. Ias. in L.

probac. concl. 1280. n. 144.
: which conclusion may seem hard, but the reason is easy, namely, because
where the testator has conceived enimitie, there is he presumed to have
altered and revoked his will Mant. d. tit. 5. n. 9. L. 3.. vlt. de adime^, leg.
ff.
: which alteration and reuocation is so much the rather presumed when the
testator himself is the cause of the enimitie, for he that will be enemy
without a cause, is less a friend then he that is unwillingly made an enemy.
And therefore I do the rather incline to their opinion, which hold that the
legacy is taken away by enimitie arising from the testator, without any just
cause given by the legatarie. If any think that this opinion does savor more
of law then of equity, let him yet consider that even in equity, the
legatarie, although innocent, ought not to receive any favor against the will
of the testator Dec. consil. 426. Ma^tic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 3. tit.
19. n. 11.
: At least howsoever the legararie were in no fault at the first, if at the
last being provoked by the testator, he become his enemy, seeking to be
revenged for the injury done unto him: in this case he leeseth his legacy,
even as well as if he himself had first broken the bond of amity Mascard. de
probac. concl. 1280. n. 145. qui hoc distinctionis foedere contrarias opiniones
conciliari putat.
.

Seventhly, if the legatarie did neglect to minister necessary help to the
testator in time of his sickness, when as he might easily have done the same,
through the want whereof the testator died, the legacy is lost L. indignu^.

Eighthly, if the legatarie by injurious and contumelious words do grievously
defame and slander the testator, or curse him with wicked speeches: In these
and such like cases the legacy is lost L. si inimicitiae. ff. de his quibus vt

light offense, or small displeasure: But then when as the testator is moved

to such bitterness of mind against the legatarie, that it may seem that it
repented the testator that he had bequeathed any thing in his testament to such

legatarie Mascard. de probac. concl. 1280. n. 147. Ripa. in L. vlt. C. de

; at the least if the offense be not very great and heinous, such as may be
thought to alter a man's purpose, even against him that had well deserved

Thirdly, when the testator and legatarie be reconciled and reduced into
friendship again, for then the former enimities do not prejudice the legatarie
L. 4. de adime^. leg. ff. Grass. Thesau. com. op.. legatum. q 78. Masc. d.
conclus. 1280. n. 149.
: Not only by reason of enimitie betwixt the testator and the legatarie,
during the testators life; but also by other occasions after the testators
death, considerable likewise in the person of the legatarie, the legacy may
be lost.

The fourth limitation is, when the legatarie does apprehend his legacy,

Of the death of the legatarie before the legacy be due.

. xxiij.
IF the legatarie die before the legacy L. si post. ff. quando dies. leg. ced.
. That we may know when the legacy is due, we are to consider, whether the
same be pure and simple, or conditional, or referred to a day Gloss. in Rub.
de cond. and demon. ff. Grass. Thesaur. co. op.. legatum. q. 43. in prin
.

When the legacy is pure and simple, the L. vnic. cum igitur. and. in
nouissime. C. de cad. tollend.
, and therefore if the legatarie die before that day, the legacy is void:
neither can the executors or administrators of the legatarie demand the same
d. L. vnic.. cum triplici.
. And so it is although the legatarie live as the fall of an house:) In this
case also the legacy is not due L. quod ff. de reb. dub.
, and consequently, not transmissible to the executors or administrators of the
legatarie. But if the legatarie do ouerliue the testator, though it be but a
very little, even a moment, then the legacy is due Castrens. in d. L. quod de
Tiraquel. de iudic. in reb. exig. lim. 3. nee long abest Ias. L. si quis. C.
de Instit. and sub. n. 5.
, and so may be recovered by the executors or administrators of the legatarie
L. si post diem. ff. quando dies. leg. ced.
: neither is it material whether the legatarie did know, or were ignorant L.
vlt. qua^do dies. leg ced. ff.
of the legacy, or whether the will were proved, or the administration of the
goods committed, whiles the legatary lived L. vnic.. sin autem C. de cad.

: for in this case also the same is due to his executors or adminisrators. L.

wherein the condition is performed or extant L. vnic. sin autem. C. de cad.

: which rule is extended although the legatarie were one of the testators
children Gloss. in L. vnic. de his qui ante aper. tab. C. Vasq. de success.
progress. lib. 3.. 29. n. 19. quae opinio communis est, vt latius per Mantic.
de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 20. n. 1.
. Item, although the condition were referred to the will of the legatarie:
Example; The testator gives to A.B. an hundred pound if he will: for in this
case also, if the legatarie die before he have declared himself willing, the
legacy is extinguished L. si ita.. si illi de leg. 1. ff.
, and so nothing is due to his executors or administrators. likewise, if the
condition be alternatiue, whereof one part is simple, and the other
conditional, if the legatarie die before the condition be extant, the legacy
is utterly void L. cum illud. ff. qua^do dies. leg. ced.
: For example; the testator does bequeath to A.B. all his plate, or if his
wife have a child, an hundred pound: albeit A.B. do ouerliue the testator,
but die before his wife have a child, the executors or administrators of the
legatarie can neither obtain the hundred pound, nor the plate DD. in d. L. cu^
illud. Aetiologia est, quia in alternatiuis no^ sunt duo legata, sed vnum.
.

Limitations of this former rule are many Vigel. method. iur. civil. part. 4.
lib. 13. c. 7. except. 2.

Secondly, when it does not stand by the legatarie wherefore the condition is
not performed, and in that respect the condition is reputed for accomplished c.
cum non stat. de reg. iur. 6. before supra part. 4.. 8.
.

Thirdly, when the legacy is not conditional, but modall L. cum tale. ff. de
cond. and demon.
, (of which difference we have spoken before Supra part. 4.. 9.
.)

Fourthly, when the legacy which was first conditional, is afterward
repeated without any condition L. non ad ea. ff. de cond. and demon. et
Castrens. ibid.
.

Fifthly, when the testator does give the legacy upon condition afterward to
be expressed, but expresses none L. pen. C. de Instit. and sub.
.

Finally, wheresoever the condition does not make the legacy conditional
(either because it is secretly included L. si dies.. vlt ff. qua^do dies leg.
ced. Manti. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 12. tit. 20. n. 5.
in the disposition, or rejected L. conditiones. de condic. Instit ff..
impossibilis Instit. de hae. red. instit. and supra. 4. and 5. part. 4.
) it does not hinder the transmission of the legacy to the executors or
administrators of the legatarie deceased, no more then if it were a simple and
pure legacy.

referred to a day, then it skilleth whether the day be altogether certain, or
altogether uncertain, or in some respect certain, and in other respects
uncertain.

In the first case, that is to say, when the day is certain, the legacy
begins to be due at the time of the death of the testator, although it can
not be demanded effectually before the day do come L. cedere diem. de verb.
sig. ff. and ibi Alciat. and. Rebuff.
. And therefore if after the death of the testator, the legatarie die also
before the day of payment, the legacy is transmitted to the executors or
administrators of the legatarie, as if it had been a pure and simple legacy L.
si dies. ff. quando dies lega. ced.
: For example; the testator does bequeath to A.B. an hundred pound at Easter,
anno domini 1600, and afterward dies, and after him the legatarie dies also
before Easter anno 1600: In this case the executors or administrators of the
legatarie, at Easter 1600. may demand and recover the legacy, because the
time is undoubtedly certain (in the reputation of law) as well in respect of
the question when, as in respect of the question whether DD. in d. L. si dies.
and in L. si post diem. ff. qua^do dies leg. ced. Grass. Thesaur. co^. op..
legatu^. q. 43. n. 3. 4. 5.
.

when the day is utterly uncertain, the legacy is compared to a conditional
legacy L. dies incertus. ff. decond. and demon.
: and therefore if the legatarie die in the mean time, the legacy is lost
without hope of deuolution thereof, to the executors or administrators of the
legatarie deceased L. vnic.. sin autem. C. de cad. toll.
: For example; The testator says: I do bequeath to A. B. an hundred pound when
he shall be married: or thus; I bequeath to A.B. an hundred pound to be paid
when he shall be married: here the day is utterly uncertain: for neither is it
certain when, neither yet whether the legatarie shall marie before the event:
and therefore if the legatarie die before he be married, his executors or
administrators have no action or right to demand the legacy DD. in d.. sin
aute^.
: neither is it material, whether the day be joined to the substance of the
legacy, as in the former example, or to the execution thereof, as in the
second example: for it is not deuolued neither in the one case, nor in the
other Bar. in L. si cui.. hoc autem de leg 1. post gloss. in L. Seius. ad
Trebell. ff. and Alex. ibid. Mantic. de coniect. vlt. vol. lib. 11. tit. 20 n.
3. and est communis opinio, test Grass. Thesaur. com. op.. legatum. q. 43. n.
7.
.

In the third case, that is to say, when the partly certain, and partly
uncertain, we are to distinguish, whether the uncertainty be in respect of the
question whether, or of the question when.

If the uncertainty be in respect of the question whether, not of the question
when: as if the testator do bequeath an hundred pound, when his son shall
come to the age of xxi. years, (for here it is certain when he shall be of
that age, but uncertain whether he shall live till he come to that age:) In
this case we must yet again distinguish: for either the time is joined to the
substance of the disposition, as when the testator says; I give to A.B. an
hundred pound when he comes to the age of xxi. years, and the legacy is not
deuolued to his executors or administrators, if he die in the mean time Bar.
in d. L. ff cui.. hoc autem. de leg. 1. L. ff Titio. in prin. qua^do dies. leg.
ced. ff. Vasq. de success. progress. lib. 3. 29. n. 3.
(except in certain cases elsewhere before specified Supra part. 4.. 17. sub
fine.
;) or else the day is joined to the execution or performance of the legacy: as
when the testator does bequeath to A. B. an hundred pound, which he wills to
be paid when the legatarie shall be of the age of xxi. years, and then the
legatarie dying in the mean time, his executors or administrators may recover
the legacy, when the time is expired that the legatarie should have been of
the age of xxi. years if he had lived L. ex his verbis. C. quando dies. leg.
ced. Bar. and Paul. de Castr. in L. si cui.. hoc autem ff. de leg. 1. Alex. in
L. Seius ad Trebel. in fin. ff. Vasq. de success. progress. lib. 3.. 29. n. 3.
verb. quandoque. and 3.
.

If the uncertainty be not in respect of the question whether, but of the
question when, as if the testator do bequeath to A.B. an C. pound, when the
executor of the testator shall die, or to be paid when the said executor
shall die. For here it is certain whether the executor must die (we must all
die) but when he must die it is uncertain: In this case the legacy is not
transmitted, the legatarie dying before the executor of the testator L.
huiusmodi. ff. qua^do dies. leg. ced. DD. in L. haeres meus. de con. and demon.
Caeual. de vsufruct. mulier. n. 70. 71. quoru^ opinio est magis recepta, vt per
Grass: Thesaur. com. op.. legatu^. q. 43. n. 8. Vasq. de success. progress.
lib. 3.. 27, n. 11.
: howbeit this legacy after another death, if it be duly considered, is not
only uncertain, in respect of the question when, but also in respect of the
question whether, because it is uncertain also whether the legatarie shall
ouerliue the executor, not only when the executor shall die d. L. haeres meus.

, as elsewhere has been declared Supra. part. 4.. 17.

Of the destruction of the thing bequeathed.
1 The legacy is extinguished, if the thing bequeathed do perish.

2 What if it perish by the fact or negligence of the executor.

3 What if the legacy be general, or do consist in quantity.

4 What if one thing of two things be bequeathed, whereof the one does perish.

may be reduced to his first matter; as when the testator does bequeath some
mass of metal be it gold or silver, tin, or such like, whereof the testator
afterward does make some vessel, or other instrument. Or on the contrary,
the testator having bequeathed a cup of gold, or other vessel, or
instrument of metal, does afterward dissolve the same to his first matter:
or the testator having bequeathed a cup of gold, does make a chain thereof:
the will of the testator by such alterations is not presumed to be altered,

But if the thing bequeathed after the form thereof be altered, cannot be
reduced to that which it was before; as wool when it is made clothe; or
timber, when it is hewn or made parcel of a ship: the testator having
bequeathed certain wool or timber, and afterward translating the same to
other forms, from whence they cannot be reduced to the former, the legacy is
extinguished L lana. ff. de leg 3. Bar. Paul. de Castro. and alij communiter.

Other limitations there be of this rule, as also diverse other causes whereby
legacies may be lost: But neither have I convenient leisure to proceed in the
discourse thereof, neither do I think the same either so needful or
profitable to be known, as these whereof I have made choice, and which I have
alredie delivered. And therefore I thought good only to refer such as are De

FINIS.
An Epilogue.
THus for thy love (loving countrieman) have I delivered unto the view of thy
judgment, the picture of my conceit concerning testaments, which if thou
shall behold sharply, then I fear strongly, thou will epsy in steed of just
proportion, lamenes, or want of some notable members; and in steed of
delectable beauty, deformity, or spots of soul and loathsome errors.
Wherefore as at the first I did earnestly entreat for favor; so now in the
end I do humbly beg for pardon. And although peradventure I might use some
reasons to draw thee thereunto, (as by giving thee to understand, First that all
the lims and bones of this my testamentarie picture, were not only heretofore
out of joint; but scattered and dispersed far asunder, some amongst the laws
civil, some amongst the decrees and decretals, some amongst our provincial
constitutions, and some amongst the laws, statutes, and customs of this
realm: and therefore the labor in searching and ioining of some of these
disme^bred members, to be rather thankfully accepted, than the not collecting
of al to be accounted a fault. Secondly, that these manifold laws being so
contrary one to another, and the interpreters of every several law being at
everlasting variance amongst themselves about every sentence, every word, and
every letter almost; the blots and blemishes of the work are so much the more
tolerable, by how much the simple truth is often obscured and mistaken for
error; and error (clothed in truths garment) embraced many times for truth it
self, even of the learned. And thirdly, that forasmuch as no man hitherto
since England was Albion, has set forth a perfect Idea of an English testator,
or a right pattern of a lawful testament within this land: The author
therefore in aduenturing to break the yse to make the passage easy for his
countrymen, failing sometimes of the fourd, and falling into the pit, may seem
worthy to be pitied, or at least unworthy to be reprehended in this
interprise, no less profitable for this common wealth, then it is usual to
die:) Nevertheless, because it more tends to the advancement of thy
commendation, to be entreated then persuaded, and more fit for mine own
safety to crave with humility, then proudly to challenge that which may be
denied: rejecting therefore these foresaid reasons, I do wholly submit my self
unto thy courtesy, beseeching thee to use me friendly, and either to pardon
freely, or to admonish charitablie: so shall I have just cause to commend thy
virtue and gladly amend any fault committed.

H. S.

Whereas there be sundry escapes in the print, I have (for thy ease) caused
those of greater consequence to be amended with a pen: the rest I shall desire
thy self to amend, or to sustain without grief.
