TO THE CHRISTIAN Reader, grace and peace in Christ Jesus.
WHen it pleased the Lord in a merciful and gentle correction, to lay his
fatherly rod of sickness and mortality, in Autumn last, upon this City of
London, the schools there both public and private, soon after (as it was
requisite) began to breake-vp. VVhereupon the Teachers were generally at more
leisure to follovv that course of practice, after the diverse studies of their
several professions, which every one affected. Among whom my self purposed
likewise to publish somevvhat of my private readings (as leisure gave leave)
in divinity. Wherein this discourse I entered the rather for the behoof and
benefit of my Scholars, to whom (as their young years were able, and
capacities apt to conceive) I have used to interpret a portion of the nevve
Testament by the space of an hour every Saboth in the morning before Common
prayer: vvherby I might the better both train them to * remember Eccles. 12, 1.

minds the vvonderfull consonancie and concord of many notable sentences with
the word of God, which now and then met the^ in their weekly lectures of

humanity: and vvithall bring the^ in disliking of other discord and
unseasonable speeches, which commonly in some Poets are without all modesty.
But besides these, the learned well know what excellent sayings, most
consonant and conspiring with the word of God, are scattered in heathen
authors Greek and Latin, which it were a great fault in the master either
lightly to ouerpasse with silence, as unprofitable, or to leave his scholars
ignorant of those marvelous lights of Nature, which the Lord had left among
the Heathen (to the intent that they should be without Romans 1, 4.

mataeologie and foolish thoughts, through the vanity of their dark hearts
and minds. For albeit they had the Shepherds Calendar, or Plovv-mans alphabet
of the world, wherein was written in great capital letters, that every
unlearned man among them might plainly read Romans 1, 19.

taught them as much in effect, for the true and distinct knowledge of the
godhead, as the Law, and word of God did instruct the Jews, Romans 2, 15.

giving to all life and breath, and all things: for in him we live, and move,
and have our being, as also certain of their own Poets have said: yet were
they so far from David's thoughts, upon the view of these heavens (who in holy
meditation confessed thus unto God: Psalm. 8, 3. etc.
When I behold thy heavens, even the works of thy fingers, the Moon and the
stars, which thou have ordained, what is man (think I) that thou art mindful

turned the truth of God unto a lie, and worshipped the creature, forsaking
the Creator, which is blessed for ever. And so, vvhiles they Romans 1, 22. and
1. Cor. 1, 22.
professed them selves to be wise, they became stark fools, as the Apostle
also witnesses. These heathen, we have, in this our Discourse, declared who
they were, what time they were severed, how long they continued separate
from Gods people, and by whom, and how they were called, and reconciled to
their brethren again. Of them therefore here will I write no more but this:
when in the year of the world 3577, Alexander the great had subdued the
Medes and Persians, and many other nations, as we have briefly touched in this
treatise, the Greek tongue, which though 600 years before that time, it was
very famous and flourishing, as may specially appear by Homers works (for all)
the honor both of learning and Nature: yet then chiefly began to be generally
studied in all the world, insomuch that every nation, as they were subject to
the Grecians, so they coueted chiefly to come in favor by speaking their
language. But after that the Romans had brought under the Grecians, and were
also conquerors of the world, the Latin tongue likewise grevv to be common
among all nations, which held on til the coming of Christ. Wherefore Pilat
(the Lord guiding his wavering mind and pen, both for the matter and manner)
was not content to write Christ's Title in Luke 23. 38.
Hebrew the Jews tongue only, but in Greek and Latin the tongues of the
heathen also, that so it might appear (though Pilate thought of no such
mystery) that as well the Gentiles and heathen, as the nation of the Jews,
were to take notice, and reap benefit of Christ's death and passion. Now the
Theme or purport of my vvriting, I desired such, as might be both most
necessary for all sorts, and least handled of any in particular. Which thing
in this kind of study, and in these our days (vvherin moving and vvorking in
us) conceive comfortable hope to our unspeakable joy in the Lord, and
thervvithall be induced to glorify God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has called us out of ignorance, sin and error, into his marvelous
light: and translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son. To which
kingdom the Lord Jesus, who alone has redeemed us, conduct and bring us, by
a true and lively faith in the merits of his death and passion, to whom,
with God the Father, and the holy Spirit, be given all honor, dominion,
power and glory for ever. From my house in Turnmill street the 4 of
Noue^ber, in the year of the joyful incarnation of Christ our redeemer 1592

THE CREATION, TRANSGRESSION AND REDEMPTION OF MAN.
In perusing this Treatise, courteous Reader (I pray you) take the Bible, and
turn to every place here quoted, which meets you in the reading: so shall
you reap double profit of your pains, and greatly confirm your conscience in
the assurance of the word of God.

GOD the Creator MAN ye transgressor
Christ being God and Man
the Redeemer.

THe Lord God, the father, the Son, and the holy Spirit, being one, and the
same god in substance, essence and nature, yet three distinct persons in the
self same divine nature: being also without beginning, and from all eternity,
at the Time began at the creation. The Angels also were then created, as
stately witnesses of Gods will, for the service of the elect. Heb. 1. 14.
beginning to manifest him self by his works (as the Apostle speaks Romans 1.
verse. 19. 20.) in six days created heaven and earth, the sea, and all the
creatures in them; and last of all in the Which is out Friday: so to the day of
man's creation, being also supposed the day of his transgression, most aptly
answers the day of his redemption, which we commonly call good Friday.
sixth day of the creation, he made man (male and female) after his own image
and likeness, The soul of man is a spiritual and divine thing, inspired in
man by the breathing of the Almighty, and therefore is immortal, Genesis 2. 7.
Job. 33. 4. Eccle. 12. 7. which being separate from the body, it self alone:
but after the general judgment together likewise with the body immortal, shall
either rest in eternal joy, or abide in endless woe, Ioh. 5. 29.
breathing in their faces the breath of life, whereby they became living
souls, Genesis 1. and 2. effectually blessing them, and commanding them to
multiply, and to subdue the earth, to rule over the fish of the sea, the fowls
of heaven, and the beasts of the field, which came therefore willingly to
submit them selves to Adam, who, as their sovereign, gave them several names,
as pleased him, Genesis 1, 28. and 2. 19. Psalm. 8, 6. etc. And in Eden or
Paradise, a garden most goodly and pleasant for waters, and all fruteful trees,
the Lord God set Adam and the woman, permitting them free liberty to eat of
all the trees in Paradise, save only of one tree, whereof he forbad them to
eat, most certainly telling them, that whenever they should eat thereof,
they should die the By Adam sin entered into the world, and death by sin goes
over all men, because all men have sinned, Rom 5 12: for it is appointed unto
me^, that they shall once die, and then comes the judgment. Hebr. 9, 27: but
they that live til the last day, shall in a moment, in sted of death, be changed
from mortal to immortal. 1. Cor. ^5. ver. 52. 53.
death. Genesis 2. 8. etc. and 3. 2. etc. Thus Adam and Eua our first parents
being ^reated right perfect, and most innocent, ^ully furnished with all goodly
gallant^esse of body, and heavenly ornaments ^f the mind, bearing all the rule
and so^eraigntie in the^, both of the earth it self, and of all the creatures
therein, Psalm. 8, 4. etc) received all these most excellent and ^nestimable
jewels at the Lords hand to their own keep and custody, both for them
selves, and for their posterity for evermore: having also free will and
liberty in them selves, either to stand and abide in the perfection of the
divine likeness of righteousness, holiness and godly knowledge, wherein they
were made, or to fall therefrom at their own will and choice: they through the
subtlety of the envious Because Moses had not mentioned the creation of the
Angels, nor Sata^s fall, which was not before the 6. day, as we see by that
survey, Genesis 1. 31. but either on that day, or very shortly after, as Io. 8 44.
therefore he speaks of the subtlety of Satan under the name of a serpent,
which for his natural wiliness, was a fit instrument both for Satan to
deceive man by, and for Moses to represent unto the rude Israelits, the
spiritual craftiness of the Devil.
Serpent the devil, most vntha^kfully This transgressio^ of Ada^ was a most
grievous sin: for he brake not simply the Lords commandment, but very
confidently crediting Sata^s lies, which Eve reported unto him, most wickedly
grudged at his creator, and conceived an hateful indignation against God, for
that he had forbidden him the eating of that fruit, by eating whereof (as he
was wickedly persuaded) he should be like unto God, and coequall with his
Creator. All this is e^idently gathered by Satan's persuasion, that they should
be as gods by transgression: and likewise of Gods deriding Adams proud
presumption in thinking by his trespass to become as God him self, Genesis 3.
verse. 5. 22. And where S. Paul says that Adam was not deceived, 1. Tim. 2,
14, he speaks not that either to excuse, or to extenuate Adams sin: but only
to admonish women of their duly deserved subjection unto their husbands, Genesis
3. 16. because their grandmother Eve, being first deceived her self, through
the subtilty of the serpent, 2. Cor. 11, 3, became also Satan's instrument to
deceive the man, Genesis 3, 6. Read Eccles. 25, 26.
transgressed the Lords commandment, in eating of the forbidden fruit, more
believing the lying serpent, then their gracious Creator, and so wilfully
running into the just punishment of eternal death, due to them selves, and to
all their posterity for the same, most justly bereft, and deprived for ever
both them selves and their offspring, of all these heavenly ornaments and
Lordly prerogatives. But our gracious and wonderful loving God most mercifully
caused Huand-cry to be made after these woeful wights, to arrouse sinful Adam
out of the bushes, whither he had vainly fled to hide himself and after
conference with him, as well to let him see him self excuselesse, as to
convince him of most unkindness, at length To the end that man might always
remember and feel this disobedience, the Lord imposed a curse upon the whole
course of Nature as touching man's use, Genesis 3, 17: from which the very creature
groneth unto this present to be delivered, Rom 8, 20 etc. which shall be by
sire at doomesday as S. Peter writes 2. Pet. 3, 7.
offreth him this special grace (purposed in him self from everlasting,
whereby the Lord both cleared his justice, and showed his mercy,) that the
seed of the woman should bruise the serpents head, Genesis 3, 15. Adam believed
this short sentence, and through faith in this promise was saved. In the
assurance of this promise were all the fathers and faithful, before Noah's
flood saved. The flood came in the year of the world 1656. For notwithstanding
the ho^ie exercises which the Lord had enioined Adam and his offspring to
practice by offerings and sacrifices, as types and patterns of that promised
seed Christ, the lamb of God, which therefore in purpose of God, in promise
to man, and in type of It is very like that the skins of those beasts, which
were slain for sacrifice at that instant of the promise of redemption, served
to cloth Adams nakedness, Ge^. 3, 21 that as their bodies were burnt in
sacrifice to prefigure Adams deliverance from helfire: so their hides likewise
might hide his shame, keep his body from cold, and continually put him in
mind of the Lords merciful covenant. And thi^ me^t the Lord in commanding the
Israelites to wear that blew guard, as a memorial of his laws, in the borders
of their garments, Number. 15 verse 38. 39. but the apparel of christians is the
Lord Jesus Christ and his ^ertues as faith, righteousness, holiness of life,
etc. Romans 13, 14. Gal. 3; 27. Ephesians. 4, 24. which in the parable are called the
wedding garm^nt, Mat. 22, 11. read Reuelat. 3. verse. 4. 18, and 14, 5.
sacrifice was slain from the beginning of the world, Reu. 13, 8. as we
plainly see by Adams sons offerings. Genesis 4. verse. 3. 4. Which were doubtless
according to Gods own appointment and accepted only by faith, Hebr. 11, 4.
And were also the faithful The first borne in every family, till the ^aw was
the sacrificer: but as the law the Levites were appointed thereunto, Exo. 19, 22
and 24, 5. Number. 8. verse. 18. 19. whose offerings (as is very like) were
approved by site sent from heaven to consume their sacrifices, compare these
quotations, Ge^. ^, 4. Leu. 9, 24. 1 King. 18, 38. 1 Chr. 21, 26. 2 Chr. 7, 1

practices of all the ten fathers before the flood, as we may well perceive by
this, that the Lord revealed to them what beasts and fowls were clean, and what
unclean, Genesis 7, 2. and 8, 20. As likewise after the flood, and before the
law, the example of Noah, Genes. 8, 20. Melchi-zedek, Genes. 14, 18. Abraham,
Genesis 12, verse. 7. 8. and 13, 18. Isaak Genesis 26, 25. Iaacob, Genesis 31, 54. and of
Job, Job, 1, 5. and 42. verse. 8. 9. witnesses. And notwithstanding also those
reverent and stately sagies, the ten Before Noah's flood they lived with bread,
salets, roots, fruits, and all increase of the earth etc. Genesis 1. 29. milk,
butter, etc. of the flocks or herds, Gene. 4 2. not having commandment to
touch the life of any creature for meat: but at the flood the Lord so weakened
the state of man's body, in shortning his days, that man stood in need of
fish and flesh also to sustain life: for before the flood the eating neither
of fish nor of flesh was permitted, Genesis 9, 3.
long-liued fathers before Noah's flood, set down in their order by Moses, Genesis
5, 3. etc. Who were all grave prophets, and preachers to proclaim Gods mercies
to faithful penitents, and to denounce his judgments against the stubburne
sinners of that age: yet they conuersing with Cains posterity (whose company
by Cains far banishment, the Lord would have had his to avoid, Genesis 4, 14.)
were now become most profane and wicked, corrupting the true religion and
worship of God, in so much that, at this time of the flood, there was but
only Noah, the tenth father of that age, whom the Lord found faithful upon
the whole earth, Genesis 6, 9. and 7, 1. And although the Lord had warned them
six score years before of that universal diluge and destruction, and that
they both heard the continual admonitions, and vehement preachings of these
three excellent fathers Methushelah, Lamech, and Noah all the time The flood
came the 17. day of the 2. month, Genesis 7. 11. which is our October (as
comparing Ex. 12, 2. with 23, 16. you may plainly perceive) and in the month
before died Methushelah, 5. years after the death of Lamech. Noah and his 3.
sons, Sem, Ham, and Iapheth, with their 4. wives Genesis 6. verse. 10. 18. were
those 8. persons saved from the flood in the Arc, 1. Pet. 3, 20. by who^ see
how the earth is replenished with inhabitants, Genesis 10. and of the caution in

almost of that long ^pace of repentance, and also saw Noah's diligence in
preparing the Ark, by Gods commandment, Genes 6. verse. 13. 14. against that
dreadful day: yet so wicked and desperate they were, that they took no notice
thereof, though it stood upon ^he destruction both of their bodies and ^oules,
for they knew nothing of it (as ^ur Savior testifies) till the flood came and
swept them all away, Mat. 24, 39. Some ^ew years after the flood, this promise
was renewed: for Noah, as a Prophet, told ^ore distinctlie of what family this
seed should come, saying: Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, Genes. 9, 26. noting
thereby ^wo things unto us, both that this bles^ng should come of the lineage of
Sem his ^econd son: and also that the rest of the ^orld (as heathen
idolaters) should be ^uered from Sems family for a time, which came to pass
in the tenth genera^on after at Abraham's calling from VR ^f Chaldea. Moses
records Sems gene^tion to abraham, Genesis 11, 10. etc. Abra^am was borne in the
year of the world 2008, and two years after the death of Abraham.
Noah, which was 352 years after the flood, when now all the families of the
earth, (saving Melchi-zedek, who by all likelihod, was that old Sem, Genesis 11.
vers^ 10. 11. and 14, 18 etc.) were fallen to idolatry and atheism, even
Terah the father of Abraham, Josh. 24. verse. 2. 14. But when Abraham was 70.
years old, the Lord By three proofs especially the scriptures commend
Abraham's faith unto us: 1. by his willingness in forsaking his fathers house,
kindred and country, to follow Gods calling he wist not whither, Genesis 12, 1.
Act. 7. 3 Gal. 3. verse 6, 17. Hebr. 11, 8. 2. by his assured hope in Gods
promise to obtain a son, when in reason there was no hope, Romans 4, 19 etc. 3.
by the ready offering up of his son Isaak, in ho^ he had received the promises,
Heb. 11, 17. etc. In him therefore we see a worthy pattern of our faith, Gal.
3, 7.
called him out of VR of the Chaldees, commanding him to forsake his native soil^
and country, and to go into a land, that h^ would show him, promising most
amply to bless him and his. Now more plainly renewing and confirming unto
him the promise of that holy seed, that in him all the families of the earth
should be blessed, Genesis 12, 1 etc. and 17, 1 etc. Act. 7* 2. which S. Paul
interprets thus: To Abraham and his seed were the promises made: He says
not, to the seeds, as speaking of many: but, And to thy seed, a^ of one
which is Christ, Galat. 3, 16. And hear at Abraham's calling from among the

begins that hateful ia^ between the church of God, through ceremonies, and
the residue of the world being heathen atheists, as S. Paul spoke sometime of
the Ephesians, Ephesians. 2. verse. 11. 12. which hatred and enemitie continued 1864.
years, viz. from Abraham's calling from VR of Chaldea, but chiefly from the
birth of his son Isaak which was 30. years after through the sign of
circumcision, Genesis 21. verse. 4. 5. And much more increased 400. years after,
at Moses law, Exodus 33, 16. Leuit. 20, 26.) unto the full accomplishment of
this holy seed Christ, who abrogating through his flesh the hatred (that is,)
the law of ceremonial commandments, which stands in ordinances, made of The
Gentiles were gathered into the shepefold of the Jews, Psa. 47. 3. Ioh. 10.
16. by Christ the great shepherd of the sheep, Isai, 49, 6. Mat. 28. verse.

This promise of the blessed seed the Lord confirms also to Isaak Genesis 26,
Isaak. Jacob.
4. likewise to Jacob Genesis 28, 14. And after the Lord had now 2509. years (for
so long was it from the creation to the law) hel^ the faithful in long
suspense of this promised Redeemer, it pleased him (upon his miraculouslie
delivering his people out of Egypt, whither, because of Ioseph^ Law.
preferment, Genes. 45. 8. Jacob, by God^ commaundment, had carried them. Gen*
46, 3 etc.) to set down in his written law, delivered by Moses, a plain
platform at large of the same promise so often before renewed. Which law should
be both as a handwriting unto his people for to show them the grieuousnes of
their tra^sgressions, Col. 2, 14. til the promised see^ should come, unto which
the promise^ were made, Gal. 3, 19. and their weak unableness to attain to
the perfect puriti^ of that law, Rom 8, 3 (for it is spirituall^ but sinful man
is carnal, Romans 7, 14) And also as a child-guide, or tutor to conduc^ them to
this promised seed Christ, Gal. 3* 24. which things were most lively
prefigured by the s^dry washings, purifyings offerings and sacrifices, which
they were bound to observe* as well to witness their own uncleanness through
Adams tra^sgression, as to imprint before their eyes ^ plain stamp and
pattern of Christ's sufferings, who should fulfill that law for the^, Mat. 5, 17.
Romans 8, 2 etc. And bearing our sins in his body on the cross, 1 Pet. 2, 24.
bring in eternal justice for us all, Dan. 9, 24.

One consideration hereof will I present for all, when the Jew, in the time of
the law should, behold the harmless beast, that was to be slain for
sacrifice, upon the head, whereof he was to * put his hands, Leuit. 1, 4.
whereby he protested Read 2. Chron. 29. 23.

was ready to suffer, the very sight of so woeful a spectacle could not but

move even his flintie heart to be inwardly touched with a deep remorse and
sorrow for his sins: and, so trembling at Gods judgment, force him (if there
were any sparkle of grace) to flee by faith to the truth of that fearful
figure, which was Christ, this promised redeemer. The same promise is likewise
440. years after the law, renewed to king David, that this blessed David.
seed should descend in kingly raze from his Herehence it is that in the ne^
testament our Lord is so usually called the son of David, concerning which
name, for want of knowledge to distinguish of Christ's two natures his Godhead
and ma^hod, our Savior put the Pharisees to a no^-plus, Mat. 22, 41 etc. for
they would not acknowledge him to be God, though both the scriptures and his
works so testified, Ioh. 5, 18. and 10, 33. Ioh. 5, 39. Mat. 11. verse. 3. 4. 5.
Ioh. 5. 36 and 15 24.
loins, 2 Samuel 7, 12 etc. Psa. 132, 11. Isai. 9, 7. The manner of the
accomplishment whereof Saint Luke penneth thus: And in the sixth month, the
Angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilie, named Nazaret, to a
virgin affianced to a man, whose name was Joseph, of the house of David, and
the virgins name was Marie. And the Angel went in unto her, and said: Hail,
thou, that art freely beloved: the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among
women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and thought what
manner salutation that should be. Then the Angel said unto her: fear not,
Marie: for thou have found favor with God: for lo, thou shall conceive in thy
womb, and bear a son, and shall call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and
shall be called the son of the Most-high. And the Lord God shall give unto him
the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for
ever, and of his kingdom shall be no end, Luke. 1, 26 etc. S. Peter thus: Men
and brethren, I may boldly speak unto you of the patriarch David etc. seeing
he was a Prophet, and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the
fruit of his loins he would raise up Christ, concerning the flesh, to set him
upon his throne, he knowing this before, spoke of the resurrection of Christ,
that his soul should not be left in grave, neither his flesh see corruption
etc. Act. 2, 29 etc. And S. Paul in this wise: of this man's seed (speaking of
king David) has God, according to his promise, raised up to Israel, the
Savior Jesus etc. Act. 13, 23 etc.

The Prophet David had wonderful revelations of Christ, in so much that he by
faith (as well as Abraham. Ioh. 8, 56) well near a 1000. years before saw
Christ crucified, and foretold what speeches he should speak upon the cross,
Psalm. 22, 1. Mat. 27, 46. Ps. 31, 5. Luke. 23, 46. Also of Judas his treason,
Psalm. 41, 9. Ioh. 13, 18. and cursed end, Ps. 109, 8. Act. 1, 16. Likewise how

(...) Now let us consider, that like as this seed Christ Jesus, (being the
dayspring from an high to visit us, Luke. 1, 78. and the true light of the
world, Ioh. 8, 12. A light to be reueiled to the gentiles (as was Numb. 24. 17.
prefigured by the star, Mat. 2, 1 etc.) and the glory of the people of
Israel, Luke. 2. 32) is called the Sun of righteousness to arise with health
under his wings unto them, that fear the Lord, Malac. 4, 2. Even so, after the
manner of the rising of the Sun, we have seen Christ's manifestation unto
the world, for the Sun, being ready to arise, first sends forth some small
glimse of his brightness, whereunto we may compare the mystery of that
aphorism: The seed of the woman shall break the serpents head, Genesis 3, 15.
Then it enlarges the same brightness with more light, to which Noah's
prophecy may be likened: Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, Genesis 9, 26. Afterward
ascending higher, and approaching nearer unto us, it puts forth his
glimmering beams of clearer light, whereto we may resemble the plainer
promises concerning Christ communicated with those after-ages of Abraham,
Genes. 12. verse. 2. 3. of Isaak, Genesis 26. verse. 3. 4. of Jacob, Genesis 28. 14. of
David, 2 Samuel 7, 12 etc. At length it discovers it self, and appears out
openly, whereunto Christ's birth and nativity answers, Mat. 2, 1 etc. and
lastly, it mounteth up above the earth, most gloriouflie in lightning,
quickening and co^forting the earth, and all things thereupon: And to this
accords Christ's exaltation and lifting up from the earth, whereby himself
was glorified, Ioh. 12, 23. drew all men unto him, verse. 32. and gave them
power believing in his name, to be the sons of God, Ioh. 1, 12. And in this
wise the holy Scripture seems to manifest unto men, from the beginning of
the world, the eternal purpose and decree of God touching Christ our redeemer.
As may also appear by those metaphorical speeches drawn from the suns
arising often used in the Scriptures, as: Deuteronomy. 33, 2. Micah. 5, 2. Mal. 4, 2.
wherefore the Apostle calls Moses law a vail, or covering, 2. Cor. 3, 14 And
Saint Peter likeneth the same law and old testament (i. the scriptures written
before the coming of Christ) unto a light that shines in a dark place, 2 Pet.
1, 19. But contrariwise in the same verse, he names Christ, or the preaching
of Christ crucified (that is the new testament, the day-dawne, and day star,
which (as Zachary John Baptists father prophesied) should give light to them,
that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, and guide our feet into the
way of peace, Luke. 1, 79. And concerning Christ's dissoluing and losing the
works of the Devil in man, that thing he effected through his passion, as he
was man, 2. Cor. 13, 4. 1 Pet. 3, 18 and 4, 1. and by his resurrection, as he
was God, Ioh. 10, 18. 1 Cor. 6, 14. and 15, 15. The Apostle in a wonderful
brevity wrappeth up both these effects saying: Jesus Christ was delivered to
death for our sins, and As the Action of Isaaks offering (being a figure of
Christ's) was 3. days in finishing (for the third day he was, after a sort
raised from the dead, Genesis 22, 4. Heb. 11. 19.) so the space of Christ's
offering himself was three days, from his death to his resurrection. Mat. 16.
21. 1 Cor. 15* 4
rose again for our justification, Romans 4, 25. As also yet more wonderfully
he abridgeth the whole sum of christian Religion thus: God is manifested in
the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the
Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up in glory, 1 Timothy 3. 16.
Having spoiled the principalities and powers, and made show of them openly,

Christ, what time the paschall lamb (a type of Christ the very lamb of God,
that takes away the sins of the world) was to be killed and eaten, Exo. 12.

Daniel, that there shall be 70 weeks, which (after the prophetical week, a
day for a year, as Ezech. 4^ 6) contain 490 years. Dan. 9, 24 etc* but

oblation, was from the ninth hour to the twelfth: as likewise at the ninth
hour Christ gave up the ghost Mat. 27. verse. 46. 50.

The Jews dividing the day (from sunrise to sunset) into 12 hours, Ioh. 11,
9^ began their evening prayer at the ninth hour (that is, as we account, at
three o^ the clock afternoon) Act. 3, 1. which continued three hours, eue^
till the evening ^acrifice of the lamb was offered at twi^ght, Exodus 29, 41.
what time also Christ's ^odie (the true sacrifice of our sins, Isai. 3, 10.
Ephesians. 5, 2. 1 Pet. 2, 24.) was taken ^om the cross, Mat. 27. verse. 57, 58.

No marvel now (the time of Christ's ^omming so long and so plainly told
before, and recorded in Daniels prophecy) (...) S. John note this in the Jews

wilful igno^ance of Gods merciful visiting them by ^is own Many of the

reprove, as Sirachides supposed, Eccles. 48, 4 etc. And as the common opinion
of the Jews and John Baptist denies that he is Elias, Ioh. 1, 21. but his
denial is after this sense of the Scribes, for so his questioners meant it. See
Herod's fear that 10. Baptist should be risen again, Mat. 14, 2. The Iowes had
long before this ti^e admitted Pythagoras his Mete^psychosis, as also h^s
profane opinion of the good and ill angel attending each one, 2 Machab. 11, 6.
Acts. 12, 15.
Scribes was, Mat. 17, 10: but that John Baptist should go before Christ in the
spirit and power of Elias, as Gabriel interprets Malachis meaning to
Zacharias, Luke. 1, 17. and Christ makes it plain, Mat. 11, 14. This final
blindness in Israel Moses by the spirit foresaw, and therefore brast out with
this hearty wish of their only happiness: Oh that they were wise, then they
would understand this: they would consider their latter end! Deuteronomy. 32, 29. with
sorrow enough the Prophet doubled this complaint: who is blind, but my servant?
or deaf, as my messenger, that I sent? who is blind as the He alludeth to the
name Jerusalem, which signifies visible peace: for the Lord had set it in the
mids of the nations, as a spectacle in their sight of all peace and
prosperity to his people: but the Jews breaking the conditions thereof, were
yet vainly confident of peace, which thus the prophet reprocheth, Ezech. 5, 5.
Ier. 7, 4. and our Lord, Luke. 19, 42.
endowed-with-peace? Isai. 42, 19. wherefore our Savior, as he went to the
cross, turning back to those wailing women, which lamenting him, little
thought of their own calamities, that should shortly ensue, mercifully
forewarneth them: Weep not for me, ye daughters of Jerusalem, but weep for
your selves, and for your children: for behold the days will come, when men
shall say: Blessed are the baren, and the wombes, that never bare, and the
breasts, that never gave suck, Luke 23. verse. 28. 29. But I am here carried
farther then I purposed, yet not so far from my purpose, whereunto I return.
S. John says that this Jesus Christ, the just, is our aduocat with the father,
and the reconciliatio^ for all our sins, 1 John. 2, verse. 1. 2. And that his
blood cleanses us from al sin, 1 John. 1, 7. for (as the Baptist says) he is
the lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world, Ioh. 1, 29. Neither
is their (as S. Pet. witnesses) salvation in any other: for among me^ there is
given none other name under heaven whereby we must be saved, Acts. 4, 12. To
him also give all the Prophets witness, that through his name, all that
believe in him shall receive remission of sins, Act. 10, 4^ Therefore the
true Christian touching all the work of his salvation, both in heart
believes, and with mouth confesses with the Psalmist thus: Whom have I in
heaven but thee? And I have desired none in the earth with thee Psa. 73, 25. He
alone is God all-sufficient, Gen 17, 1. mighty and sufficient to save, Isai.
63, 1. neither is there any other that hears our words, Isai, 41, 26. and
63. verse. ^. 16. Wherefore David calls him: O thou that hear the prayer,
Psalm. 65. 2. And Isay, sets down the very fo^me of every Christians faith
and confession thus: Only in the Lord touching me (shall he say) is
Righteousness, in the orginall t^ngue is red in the pl^n^mber, to sig^ifie unto
us th^^ all our right^^^s^esse is of the Lord, and that we should never once
open our mouth to justify our selves, Eze. 10, 63.
all my righteousness and strength, Isai. 45, 24. for Christ Jesus (who is al
in all, Col. ^, 11. Ioh. 1, 9. Ro^. 9, 16. Ephesians. 1, 23 Phil. 2, 13) of God is
made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption,
that God alone might have all the glory, 1 Cor. 1. verse. 30. 31. Now the means
to obtain this righteousness in Christ, is by hearing the word of God (either
red: Exodus 24, 7. Deu. ^1, 11. Ioh. 20, 31. Act. 15, 21. Ephesians. 3, 4. Col. 4, 16,
1 These 5, 27. or Preached: Act. 8, 35 etc and 16. verse. 14. 32. 1 Cor. 14.
verse. 24 25) assuredly to believe all the promises of God in his son our
Savior, 2 Cor. 1 20. 1 Ioh. 5. verse. 10. 11) applying them to thy self thus,
That Christ Jesus died for my sins, and rose again for my iustication, Rom
4, 25. And the Apostle says, if thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord
Jesus, and believe in thy heart that God raised him up from the dead, thou shall
be saved: for with the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the
mouth man confesses to salvation, for the scripture says: whosoever believes
in him stall not be ashamed, ^om. 10, 9 etc. The Iarler at Philippi asking Paul
and Silas what he should do to be saved, they answered: Believe in the Lord
Jesus, and thou shall be saved, Act 16. 20 etc. The Scribe demanding of Christ
what he should do to inherit eternal life, is sent to the law, and word of God
to mark what he reads there, Luke. 10, 25.

But here (by the occasion of our Lords question, how read thou?) pawse we a
little, and advisedly let us consider the force and efficacy of reading the
word of God. The reading of Gods word, and preaching of the same, are the two
only, and ordinary means, whereby (through the working of the spirit) the
Lord conueieth his word into our hearts: both which are expressed by one word
in Hebrew Kara, which signifies to cry, or call: to proclaim, pronounce, or
preach: to declare, or read, Exodus 24, 7. Deuteronomy. 31, 11 etc. After which the
Greek (...) seems to be feigned, bearing the same sense of proclaiming,
preaching or pronouncing, Isai. 58, 1. Reuelat. 5, 2. As likewise S. James
takes preaching and reading the word of God both for one, Act. 15, 21. ^a^. 1.
25. and touching that place: How shall they hear without a preacher? Romans 10
14. It is principally meant of the first publishing the glad tidings of the
Gospel, as well by Christ him self, Isai. 9, 2. and 41, 27. and 49, 6. and 52,
7 etc. Mat. 9, 35. and 17, 5. Romans 15, 8. Hebr. 1, 2. and 2, 3. as by his
Apostles, first to the Jews, Mat. 10. verse. 5. 6: after to the Gentiles in all
the world, Mat. 28, 19. Romans 16, 26. Colos. 1, 23. Confer Isai. 52. verse. 7. 8.
9. 10. with Romans 10. verse. 12. 14. 15: for both the Prophet, and the Apostle
speak of uniting Christ's whole church of Jews and Gentiles, which could not
be called, and conioined but by preaching the Gospel, as Saint Paul testifies,
Ephesians. 2, 11 etc. and it is blasphemy to derogat from that excellent and
effectual ordinance of God, the reading of his word, that it should not as well
beget faith in the hearers, if with an honest and good heart they read (or
hear it red) and keep the same, Luke 8, 15, as confirm and increase faith in
them, being begotten by the same word, 1 Ioh. 1, 4: for the word of God in it
self is equally heard, whether it be red, Luke. 24, 45, or preached, Act. 16,
14. and equally edifieth, if it be understood, Act. 8, 30, and withal tempered
with faith in them that hear it, Hebr. 4, 2. And therefore the Apostle
earnestly charge the reading his epistles, Col. 4, 16. 1 These. 5, 27. 2
These. 2, 15. And to that end also was the Gospel written, as Saint John
affirms, Ioh. 20, 31. read Ephesians. 3. verse. 3, 4: This I write not to
maintain unlearned readers in the church, much less to make them equal to
the preachers of the word, for I desire with Saint Paul* that they all could
preach, 1 Cor. 14, 5. as their place requires of them, Ioh. 21, 15. Acts. 20,
28. 1 Cor 12, 28. 1 Timothy 3, 2. 2 Timothy 2, 2. and 4, 2. 1 Pet. 5, 2. yea rather I
wish with Moses, that all the Lords people were Prophets, Numb. 11, 29 (for I
well know, and willingly confess that the preaching of the word ought to be
preferred before the reading of the same, because of our dullness, Isai. 28.
verse. 9, 10. Hebr. 5, 11:) but my writing is only to this end, that we should
not neglect (as we do) so excellent a benefit, and blessed ordinance of God, as
is the reading of his word, being so severely commanded, and highly
recommended to his church. Now let us go forward: The holy Scriptures are The
authority and power of the holy Scriptures.
able (and therefore sufficient) to make us wise unto salvation, through the
faith which is in Christ Jesus: for the whole scripture is given by inspiration
of God* and is profitable to teach and improve, to correct and to instruct in
righteousness, that the man of God may be absolute, being made per^ect unto
all good works, 2 Timothy 3, 15 etc. when our Lord would control any er^our, he
usually objected, Have ye not ^ed? Mat. 12. verse. 3. 5. and 19, 4. and 21,
42. and 22, 31 etc. signifying thereby that the ^acred Scriptures ought to be
our only direction and guide, and therefore the ho^ie Ghost calls the word
of God a lan^erne unto our feet, and a light unto our ^aths, Psalm. 119, 105.
Prou. 6, 23. wherefore Moses exhorting the Israelits to embrace and observe the
law and word of God, tell^eth them that it is not only their wisdom and
understanding in the sight of all people, but even their life also, and the
^engthning of their days in the land: and that all the people of the earth
shall be afraid of them therefore* Deuteronomy. 4* 6 and 28, 10. and 32, 47. wherefore
the Lord complains of the neglect thereof, saying: I have written unto them
the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing, Hos. 8,
12.

But the holy Ghost, by the pen of S. Paul has set down an invincible S.
Paul's general reason for the just trial of true religion.

antichrist so to oppose himself against God, 1 Timothy 4, 3. And touching our
meats, by grace, or thanke^giuing, they are sactified, 1 Timothy 4, 4. which thing
(besides that our Lord himself usually observed, Mat. 14, 19 etc) was also

with fained words, they should make merchandise of us, 2 Pet. 2, 1 etc. Saint
^ohn sets open the pedlarie-packe of their merchandise, by which their wares
we may well perceive what merchants Saint Peter* means, among which
merchandise Saint John reckons the souls of men, Reuelat. 18, 11 etc Read
the place, for it is notable, and you shall see that the very wares will
plainly bewray the merchants unto you. We have seen before that it is sin to
make either angel, the virgin Marie, or any other saint our advocate, mediator,
or intercessor to God for us, not only because the holy scriptures appoint
none such: but for that also that it is Christ's office alone, as himself
witnesses, No man comes to the father but by me, Ioh. 14, 6. for there is
one God, and one Mediator between God and man. which is the man Christ Jesus,
1 Timothy 2, 5. And touching Christ's mediation see a manifest example, Zechar. 1,
12 etc. wherefore the prophet Isai calls him the angel of Gods face, or
presence, Isai. 63, 9. Ro^ 8, 34. Hebr. 7, 25. for by Jesus Christ the true
christians offer the sacrifice of prai^ always to God (that is) the fruit of
the lips, which confess his name, Hebr. 13* 15. Revel. 8. verse. 3. 4. Let us
therefore (following the counsel of the Apostle) g^ boldly unto Christ's
throne of grace (for he is our High-sacrificer, and Mediator* Hebr. 3, 1. and
5, 5 etc. and 6, 20) that w^ may receive mercy, and find grace to help^ in
time of need, Heb. 4, 16. The Psalmist* the more to encourage us to frequent
this throne of grace, exemplifieth unto us, by a comparison of the lesser, how
readili^ we shall speed in our suites at Christ's throne, saying: Moses, Aaron
and Samuel called upon the Lord for pardon, and^ he heard them graciously,
Psa. 99, 6. How much more then may we be sure to obtain either for our selves,
or for others, by the intercession of Christ the son of God? Romans 8, 34.

And here a little to enlarge this matter for our further instruction, let us
consider that Christ is our Prophet, our Highpriest, and our King, which three
offices of Christ the Apostle plainly describes, Hebr. 1. namely his
prophetical office, verse. 2. his priest-hod in these words: who has by
himself purged our sins. And his kingly dignity thus: And sits at the
right hand of the majesty in the highest places etc. v. 3. and 10, 12. Christ
is therefore A great Prophet to interpret the mind and will of God his father
unto us, Deu. 18. v. 18. 19. Ioh. 1, 18. and 6, 45. Act. 3, 22 etc. Ephe. 2,
17. Heb. 1, 2. touching our redemption, and eternal salvation in Christ,
purposed with God before the world was made, Ephesians. 1, 4. by whose spirit the
Prophets in old time spoke Ge^. 6, 6. 1 Pet. 1, 11. and 3, 19. 2 Pet. 1, 21.
An everlasting King to rule us, Isai. 9. v. 6. 7. Ezech. 37. verse. 22. 24. Dan.
2, 24 etc. Hos. 3, 5. Psalm. 132, 11 etc. Luke 1, 32 etc. And an High Priest to
reconcile us unto God his father, Isai. 42, 6. Malac. 3, 1. Col. 1, 20 etc. 1 Timothy 2, 5. Hebr. 7, 24 etc. and 9. verse. 11. 12* by offering up his own body
in sacrifice upon the alter of the cross to pacify Gods wrath for our sins,
Hebr. 10* 10. 1 Pet. 2, 24. which unspotted, and holy sacrifice of his
immaculate body was sufficient in it self to satisfy for all the sins in
the world, 2 Cor. 5, 14. 1 Timothy 2, 6. Hebr. 2, 9: but effectual only for the
sins of the elect, and believers, John. (...) 12. which the holy Scripture
calls, The many, Isai 53. verse. 11. 12. Dan. 9, 27. Mat. 26, 28. Hebr. 9,
28. This his priesthood the high priests of the law prefigured, Exodus 28. Hebr.
5 and 7. And Christ has made all christians, priests unto God, Revel. 1, 6, to
offer unto him their bodies, Romans 12, 1 a contrite heart, Psalm. 51, 17. praise
and thanksgiving, Psalm. 116, 17. Hebr. 1^, 15. and liberality toward the
poor, Phil. 4, 18. Hebr. 13, 16. Job. 29, 13. Psa, 16* 3. Touching his private
life, from his birth till his baptism, the Evangelists write little, because
his humane actions in that space little concerned us, saving that his whole
life was poor and miserable, Isai 53, 3, that we through his poverty might be
made rich, 2 Cor. 8, 9. he increased daily in wisdom, stature, and favor
with God and men, and was subject to his parents, and exercised Joseph's
carpentarie art. Luke. ^. verse. 51. 52. wherefore sometime the Jews call him,
The Carpenter Mary's son, Mark. 6, 3. which name though they gave him in
derision, yet was it more honorable then they imagined: for he was indeed, The
great Carpenter of the world, Col. 1, 16. Hebr. 3, 4. The Jews knew well that
he was utterly unlearned, and so they confess, Ioh. 7, 15. as also his
Disciples were, Acts. 4, 13. whereof Saint Paul yields us this reason, That
our faith should not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God, 1 Cor.
2, 5. Therefore says Saint Peter, If any man speak, let him talk as the
words of God, 1 Pet. 4, 11. And Christ denies that his doctrine was his own
(as he was man) but of God, John. 7, 16: for indeed he was taught of God, Isai.
50. verse. 4. 5. And therefore was able, when he was but twelve years old, to
ask the learned doctors such questions, that all that heard him, were astonished
at his understanding and answers, Luke. 2. verse. 46. 47. Of his questions see
an example, Mat. 22, 41 etc. At the age of 30* years he was baptized, Luke 3,
23. as at that age also the Leuiticall priests were fully admitted to execute
their office, Number. 4, 47. Christ (as it should seem) was baptized the 15. day
of September, in the feast of tabernacles, Leuit. 23, 34: for so are there just
those 1260. days, Reuelat. 12, 6, from his baptism to the 14. day of March
(3. years and an half after) when he suffered his passion, according to the

for the like barbarous cruelty against the lights of the world, Phil. 2, 15.

Revel. 19, 20. and 20, 12. was likewise the space that Christ the head of his
church, Ephesians. 1, 22. endured all indignities, even to the shameful death of the
cross, Phil. 2, 8, Hebr. 12, 2. Isai. 50, 6. as the Prince of our salvation
consecrated through afflictions, because he that sanctifies, and they, which
are sanctified, are all of one, Hebr. 2. ves. 10. 11. And this space is also
expressed sometime by half a prophetical week, answerable to Daniels
midweeke, Dan. 9, 27. viz. three days and an half, Reuelat. 11, 9. sometime
by 42 months, Revel. 13, 5. sometime by a time, two times and half a time*
Dan. 7, 25. and 12, 7. Revel. 12, 14. All which varieties express yet one
space of time, to signify rather a certain measure of afflictions determined
in Gods everlasting purpose to conform his Church (both of the Jews and
Gentiles) to the image of his own son, Romans 8, 29. 2 Cor. 4, 11. 1 Pet. 5,
10. then any certain time of persecution, which the church of Christ must
endure according to the will of God, Romans 6, 6. 2 Cor. 1, 5. and 4, 10. Heb.
10, 36. 1 Pet. 3, 17. And immediately after his baptism he was visiblie
replenished with the holy spirit, Mat. 3, 16. Luke 4, 1. And presently led by
the same spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, Mat. 4, 1.
Heb. 2, 18. and 4, 15. where he being among wild beasts, Mark. 1, 13. which of
old time were wont to frequent the deserts along the river Jorden, Zechar. 11,
3. continued fasting 40. days in holy meditation, before he entered that great
work of his fathers business, which was inioined him of God, in accomplishing
the truth of Moses law, by sealing up, and fulfilling, the vision and Prophet,
and abolishing the daily sacrifice and oblation of the law, Dan. 9. ve. 24.
27. through the one oblatio^ of himself, Heb. 9, 14. and 10, 14. whereby he
cancelled the handwriting of the ceremonial law, which continually revived
and testified our sins against us, Col. 2, 14. and thereby brought in
everlasting righteousness for us all, Dan. 9, 24. Hebr. 10, 14. Moses likewise
at the giving of the law had continued 40. days fasting in the Lords presence
upon the mount, Exodus 34, 28. And Elias also at the restoring of the same law,
was 40. days miraculouslie sustained without any food, 1 King. 19. v. 8. 14.
which miraculous abstine^ce of Moses, Elias, and of Christ, shows the holy
perfection of the law in it self, Romans 7, 12. which was delivered, restored,
and abolished by one and the same miracle, though, through the infirmity of
our flesh, Romans 8, 3, it could not yet with all that perfection make us
perfect, Heb. 7, 19. and 10, 1. but Christ's one offering of himself has made
perfect for ever them, that are sanctified, Heb. 10, 14. Thus therefore in the
end of those 40. days, having put the Tempter to flight, he came forth and
preached the glad tidings of our salvation, Mat. 4, 17. and 9, 35. even the
general Jubilee of our everlasting freedom from the captivity of Satan,
sin, hell, and eternal death, Leuit, 25. verse. 9. 10. Luk 4. verse. 17. 18

themselves (that is, the breakers of that spiritual wedlock, Ier. 31, 32.
Ezech. 16, 8) but even to the 3. and 4. generation of their adulterous
posterity, Exodus 20, 5. Read Hos. 2. verse. 2. 3. 4. 5. And Moses exhorting the
Israelites (as knowing that he should very shortly after be taken from them)
charge them diligently to attend to the law and commandments of the Lord,
and especially that they should beware of idolatry: for the Lord (says he)
spoke unto you out of the mids of the fire, and ye heard the voice of the
words, but saw no similitude save a voice. Take therefore good heed unto your
selves (for you saw no image in the day that the Lord spoke unto you in Horeb
out of the mids of the fire) that ye corrupt not your selves, and make you a
graven image, or representation of any figure, etc. Deuteronomy 4. verse. 12. 15. 16.
whereby Moses plainly shows that the Lord of purpose withheld from them all
show of figure and likeness, causing them only to hear a voice (for none can
express the image of a voice, as says Esdras, 4 Esd. 5, 37) because they
should make no manner image at all: no, though it were possible for them to
imitate the very image of God himself to worship him thereby, yet were it
unlawful for them so to do: for God is a spirit, and they that worship him,
must worship him in spirit and truth, for the father requires even such to
worship him, John 4, 23 etc. Good works also these merchants most groslie abuse

29, 25. Isai. 57, 20. Hab. 2, 4. Iam. 2, 19.
trembling, Phil. 2, 12. And this is the true making his calling and election
sure unto his own heart and soul, as Saint Peter wills, 2 Pet. 1, 10, which
else is undoubtedly sure under the Kings broad seal with God, as Saint Paul
testifies, 2 Timothy 2, 19. It is most certain therefore, which the Apostle
says, that we are ingrafted by baptism with Christ to the similitude of his
death and resurrection, knowing that our old man (that is, the works which by
nature we have drawn from sinful Adam) is crucified with Christ, that the
course and reign of sin in our mortal bodies might be destroyed, seeing we
are dead with Christ, as touching sin (as our dipping in the water of
Baptism signifies) but are risen again to a newness of life unto God in
Jesus Christ (as our taking up again from the same water presents) giving
our bodies as instruments and servants of righteousness and holiness of life,
Romans 6, 5 etc. For our Lord Jesus has therefore redeemed us with his most
precious blood from that dreadful and damnable state, wherein our father Adam
was, when he fled to the trees for a vain covert from the Lords presence in
Paradise, that we now being delivered out of the bands of Satan, and the hands
of the wicked our enemies spiritual and corporal, might serve him without
fear in true holiness, and righteousness all our life long, Luke 1. verse.
74. 75. And not that we should If, when the Lord, who with a word of his mouth
made heaven and earth, Ps. 33, 6. shall likewise with his word raise up the
dead out of their graves at the last day, Ioh. 5, 28^ none will think that
they have any power in that work to quicken themselves: why in our spiritual
rising from sin, wherein we were dead, Ephesians. 2, 1. when he says unto us,
Awake thou that sleep and stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
light, Ephesians. 5, 14. Should we once dream that we are helpers with Gods grace*
for our sufficiency is of God, 2 Cor. 3, 5. who works in us both the will
and the deed, even of his good pleasure, Phi. 2, 13. And keeps us by his
power through faith unto salvation. 1 Pet. 1, 5. read Romans 8, 30. and 9, 16.
See S. Paul's conclusion, Romans 3, 28. where he opposes faith to the whole law,
verse. 21, 12. and 4, 13, etc. Read Phil. 3. verse. 6. 9. and Gallat. 3. verse.
11, 12. John, 17. Tit. 3, 5.
merit any thing of our salvation by our works (as those Merchants teach) and
so deny the Lord that bought us; for when we have done all those things, which
are commanded us, we are unprofitable servants, and have done but that, which
was our duty to do, Luke 17, 10. for Jesus christ alone has made us his
peculiar people, and sheep of his pasture, and not ^e our selves, Psalm. 100,
3. And as all were ^ead in Adams transgression, so Christ ^ied to redeem all,
that they which live, should not henceforth live unto them^elues (as they did
in ignorance before their calling, Romans 6, 19. Tit. 3. 3. 1 Pet. 1, 4) but unto
him which died for them, and rose again, 2 Cor. 5, 15: who his own self alone
has trodden the wine press of the bloody fury of all our spiritual
e^emies, Satan, sin, hell, death etc. for the ^escue of his church, and
redemption of his people, even by the might of his own ^rme, without any
helper, Isai. 59, 16, and 63. verse. 3, 5. Heb. 1, 3. and freely bought out our
transgressions by his bitter passion, and purchased for us Gods everlasting
favor again, and that unspeakably more abundant, Ioh. 10, 10. Romans 5, 17.
and 8, 17, and more sure, 1 Pet. 1. ver. 3. 4. 5. (through the same his
obedient sufferings for us, Phil. 2, 8. Hebr. 5, 8) then ever had Adam in his
innocent roialty. Good works then serve to many excellent purposes, but chiefly
to the glory of God, as our Lord commands, Mat. 5, 16. And they so testifying
our faith and obedience toward God in the sight of men, do justify us before
men, as S. James witnesses* Iam. 2. ver. 22. 23. 24.

Thus have we seen that Jesus Christ Act. 4, 12. and 15, 11. 1. Pet. 1, 20. 1*
Ioh. 5, 11. Heb. 11, 2. etc.
is the only, and all sufficient means ordained of God, before the foundation
of the world, for the only salvation of the holy Patriarchs and Prophets, and
of all men even from Adam, in all ages, as well before the coming of Christ in
the flesh, as after, to the worlds end: so that the saying of the Apostle is
clearly verefied: Jesus Christ yesterday and to day, the same also is for ever,
Heb. 13, 8. Hereby likewise we see, that their purgatory is but the Purgatory.
Popes painted fire, and is not in the scriptures, as also no one point of
popery is, and therefore all sinful. And for Purgatory, it was devised of
the heathen Atheists long before the days of any Pope, within the compass of
those 1864 years, wherein we said that Abraham and his posterity were separate
from the Gentiles, which space the Apostle calls the Times-past, wherein God
suffered the Gentiles to walk in their own ways, Act. 14, 16. And ^herein,
after a sort, the Lord hid him^lfe from them, as Isai speaks 45, 15, as
^ntrariwise the same Prophet foretold ^at the Lord would discover his holy ^me
in the sight of all the Gentiles, that (...) the ends of the world might see
the sal^ation of God, 52, 10. Of those Heathen (I ^ay) and in that time, a kind
of Purgatory ^as invented by their vain Poets and ^hilosophers (who were the
divines of ^he Heathen) as in the writings of Plat^ and Virgil it appears,
from whom these ^orthy merchants (for fail of scripture) ^aue cosoningly
gathered the dead coals ^f their Purgatory, and blown up the same ^o vehemently
with the boistrous belows ^f their own hot burning breath) that they ^aue made
it nothing less, if not much more) terrible, for the time, then hell it self.
A devilish devise merely forged of these merchants, whereby (as also by their
mass) they made merchandise of men's souls, as * Peter and John foretold us.
Yet is there a double Purgatory, or purgation of Christians in this life: The
one is, whereby we are cleansed from all our sins by the blood of Jesus
christ, Heb. 1, 3. 1 Ioh. 1, 7^ Revel. 1, 5 which was also signified vnd^ the
law by that blood offered, Leuit. 17, 11, which see how the Apostle
interprets 1 Hebr. 10, 1 etc. For almost al things were by the law purged
with blood, an^ without shedding of blood is no remission, Heb. 9, 22. This
our first purgation is figured also by baptism, where our washing in the
water (or new birth, Tit. 3. 5) betokens our putting on of Christ, Gal. 3,
27. which in the Revelation is called the white raiment* Revel. 3, verse. 4.
18, and is named of S. Paul, the new man, which after God is created in
righteousness and true holiness, Ephesians 4, 24, which is to mortify the deeds
of the body by the spirit, Romans 8, 13, and to put off the sinful body of the
flesh, Col. 2, 11, that is, to crucify our old man, that the body of sin might
be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin, Romans 6, 6, for they
that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts, Gal.
5, 24. read Col. 3, 5, and Tit. 2, verse. 11. 12 etc. Our other purgation is by
the fire of afflictions and persecutions, Dan. 12, 10, which all that will live
godly in Christ Jesus must endure, Psalm. 34, 19. Phil. 1, 29. (...) Tim. 4, 10.
2 Timothy 3, 12. 1 Pet. 1, ver 6. 7: that the trial of our faith being much more
precious then gold, that perishes (though it be tried by fire) might be sound
unto our praise and honor, and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ, whom
we have not seen, and yet love him; in whom now though we see him not, yet do
we believe and rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorious, receiving the end
of our faith, even the salvation of our souls, 1 Pet. 1. ver. 7, 8* 9, for if
we be without the corrections whereof all the faithful are partakers, then are
we bastards and not sons, Hebr. 12, 8. And here we may see that Bildad
argued very absurdly against Job, in reasoning thus: If thou were righteous,
God would not afflict thee, but he afflicts thee, therefore art thou
unrighteous, Job 8. ver. 6. 20. Wherefore Job confuteth this absurdity in the
next chapter, verse. 21. 22. These afflictions of the faithful were most lively
represented by the beasts divided in the midst, in the covenant that God made
with Abraham, where the fowls fell upon the carkases, and^ the Lord went
between those diuide^ pieces of the beasts with a smoking furnace and
firebrand, Genesis 15. verse 10. 11. 17. to teach Abraham that his posterity should
suffer many and diverse afflictions, to be rent and torn in pieces, and tried
with fire and faggot, as the lord there in a word plainly expresses, verse 13.
Exodus 2, 11. Heb. (...) verse 36. 37. In the law likewise this was prefigured,
where they were commanded in all their oblations to offer salt, Leuit 2, 13.
which Christ himself thus enterpreteth: Every man shall be salted with fire,
and every sacrisice shall be salted with salt, Mark 9, 49. This sacrifice is
every Christian man's body, which he is bound of duty and service (even by
reason Romans 6, 19.) to give up, and offer holy and acceptable unto God, To.
12, 1. for to this end our savior says to all: If any man will come after me,
let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me, Luke 9,
23. I am loath to be longer in this point, yet since we are come thus far into
the field of Christian combats, let us at the least take a survey of the
battle: for it may be though we comenow but only to see the host, as David
did, 1 Samuel 17. verse. 17. 20. that the Lord will one day call us forth as he
did David, to fight against Goliath, verse 49 etc. For howsoever worldly
soldiers are discharged either for infirmities, or age: yet none are exempted
from this christian warfare, but all (even from children, Mat. 19, 14) that
fear God, must prepare themselves to this warefare, which is not against
flesh, and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against worldly
gouerners, the princes of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
wickednesses, which are in the hie places, Ephesians. 6, 12. The weapons of this
warfare are the very whole armoure of god, Ephesians. 6, 11 etc. by which Christ our
Captain has already conquered all the power and kingdom of Satan for us,
Isai. 59. verse. 16. 17. 18. Wherefore Saint Paul as an Heralt about to cry an
Alarm in this great host, bids us to be strong in the Lord, and in the
power of his might, Ephesians. 6, 10. And to watch, stand fast in the faith, to quit
us like men, and be strong, 1 Cor. 10, 13. And he shows the means how we may
so do, namely by continuing in one spirit, and in one mind, fighting together
through the faith of the Gospel, Philip. 1, 27. S. John also (to comfort us)
before we have given one stroke, tells us that we have already gotten the
victory, and overcome the wicked one, that is the Devil, 1 Ioh. 2, 13. This
might seem unto us a paradox, but that we cannot forget our grand captain
Christ, the head of his body the Church, Col. 1, 18. who has spoiled the
principalities, and powers, and triumphed over the^ in his cross, Col. 2, 15.
and so cast out the prince of this world, Ioh. 12, 31. and overcome the world,
Ioh. 16, 33. Thus therefore against Satan, and his kingdom, with all our
spiritual enemies, being first subdued by Christ, we are set to fight that we
might be most sure of the victory, seeing our Captain has given them their
deaths wound. Wherefore now if we do but resist the Devil (in a steadfast
faith, as S. Peter advises, 1 Pet. 5, 9) he will fly from us, as Saint James
says, Iam. 4, 7. We see then that Christ our Captain deals with us in this
christian fight, as Captain Joshua did with the chief war^iers of Israel in
the Lords battle against ^he Amorits, who causing the 5. Kings of ^he Amorits
to be brought out unto him ^orth of the cave at Makkedah, where for ^eare they
had hid themselves, said unto ^he chief of the men of war, which went with
him: Come nere, set your feet upon ^he necks of these kings etc. fear not,
^or be faint-hearted, but be strong: for ^hus will the Lord do to all your
enemies, against whom ye fight, Josh. 10. verse 24. ^5. And though we be able
to do all things through the help of Christ, which ^trengthneth us, Phil. 4,
13. for it is he, that shall tread down our enemies, Psalm. (...) 8, 13. yet
whatsoever fails in us to ^erforme against our spiritual aduersa^ies, that
Christ himself most tenderly ^ffecteth for us, as good Captain Gide^n did
touching those kings of Midia, Zebah and Zalmunna, against whom Ie^her his
eldest son durst not draw his (...), Iud 8, 20. yea we shall walk upon ^he
lion and the aspe, the young lion and ^he dragon shall we tread under feet, Ps.
^1, 13. for even like as in old time Christ was the Captain and guide unto
the Is^raelites to conduct them safely through the great and terrible
wilderness in the borders of Moab, wherein were fier^ serpents, and Scorpions,
Deuteronomy. 8, 15. which conduction (as the Prophet notes) ough^ never to be
forgotten, Iere. 2, 6. Even s^ Christ has given us power to tread o^ serpents
and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, that nothing man hurt us,
Luke 10, 16. Isa. 11, 6. and 65, 25. Ho^ 2, 18. Notwithstanding the^ that for
Christ's sake we be killed all day long, and counte^ as sheep for the slaughter:
yet in all these things we are more then conquerer^ through our Captain, that
loves us Romans 8. verse. 36. 37. for though we walk^ in the flesh, yet we do
not war after the flesh: for the weapons of our warfare an^ not carnal, but
mighty through God to^ cast down holds, casting down the imaginations, and
every high thing, tha^ is For an example here of see with what violence Satan's
power falls down at the Apostles preachings, Luke 10, 18. Read act. 24, 26.
where Paul a prisoner makes Felix the president to quake.
exalted against the knowledge o^ God, and bringing into captivity every
thought to the ordinance of Christ, Cor. 10. verse. 3. 4. 5. And our Captain is
faithful, which will not suffer us to be ^mpted above that we be able, but
will ^uen give the issue with the tentation, that we may be able to bear it, 1
Cor. 10, ^3. Therefore let us not be afraid for any ^errour, 1 Pet. 3, 14. But
as our Captain jesus, that he might sanctisie the people ^ith his own blood,
suffered without the gate: even so let us go forth out of the ^ampe, to this
fight bearing his reproach, Heb. 13. verse. 12. 13. Knowing this, that if we
suffer with Christ, we shall also be glorified with him, Romans 8, 17. and though
we know, that this our strife against sin (Hebr. 12, 4) is always in our
Captains sight, Psalm. 33, verse. 18. 19. yet the more to encourage us thereunto
he tells us that he knows our tribulations. Revel. 2, 9. for he knows
whereof we are made, Ps. 103, 14, and is touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, because his own self was in all things tempted in like sort,
Hebr. 4, 15. therefore he supporteth us, when we faint, and says to every one
of us: My grace is sufficient for thee, 2 Cor. 12, 9. fear none of those
things, which thou shall suffer, but be thou faithful unto the death, and I
will give thee the crown of life, Revel. 2, 10. Mass.


Their Mass likewise is most flatly against Heb. 2, 17. and 3, 1. and 4, 14
etc. and 5, 5. and 6, 20. and 7. verse. 16. 21. and 8, 1. and 9, 11. and 13, 12.
the word of God: for whereas Jesus Christ is our only High-sacrificer to
offer and present us blameless in his own merits and righteousness unto God
his father, and that by offering up his body on the cross for our sins once
for all, Heb. 9, 25 etc. and 10. 10 etc. These merchants have of their own
brain devised a strange sacrifice, and priests for the nonce, to offer it in
Christ's stead to God, as propitiatory both for the quick and dead, which
contumelious blasphemy unto Christ (besides that so they crucify again to
themselves the son of God, and make a mock of him, Heb. 6, 6) who sees not
to be wickedlie devised of those merchants to make merchandise of Gods people
for their own filthy lucre?

And where they say as blasphemously (for all their cosoning is blasphemy,
Revel. 13. 1) that the Jews The Jews falsely charged by the Papists.
have falsified and corrupt the old Testament, and therefore that the doctrine
thereof is doubtful, they speak most ignorantly and untruly: for we have
Christ's word to the contrary, who says: That place is otherwise taken: but
the plain words of the text wash this crime away.
Verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth perish, one jot, or one title of
the law shall not escape, Mat. 5, 18. Of all the The pricks which now are used

is called a jote, and (for the littleness) a little: whereby our Lord, to

not even so little of the law shall fail. Besides, our Savior rectifying the
false interpretations Mat. 5, 21 etc. and 15, 4 etc.
of the law by the Scribes and Pharisees, never charge them of altering any
text thereof: yea rather he confirms the purity of the law, by sending the
people to the diligent reading of Moses and the Prophets, Mat. 23, 1 etc. Luke
10, 26. and 16, 29. John. 5. 39. And there is no one point of doctrine
contained in the new Testament, that is not also confirmed, and approved by the

And here because we are come to S. John's Revelation, which contemeth a
general prophecy of all the afflictions (general and particular) that the
Church of Christ shall endure till the last day, and by most evident tokens

Babylon, Reu. 16, 19. and 18, 2 etc. which (by the spirit of prophecy) he saw
should no less cruelly persecute the Saints and servants of Christ. And for
this similitude of Rome with Babylon, S. John calls Rome, or rather
Antichrist the king of that Antichristian vsurpatio^, Isa. 21, 2. Iere. 51, 25.

Wherefore Irenaeus, or some grave father in that age, have wisely (as the holy
Ghost advised, Reu. 13, 18) gathered his characterie name of the Greek (...),

This Romish Babylon, and papal corporation S. John calls not a Virgin (as
yet the Prophet Isai named old Babylon, Isai. 47, 1) but an abominable whorish
woman, who, for her filthy Because Antichrist must sit in the temple of God,

the Angel certifieth John that it is that great city which rules over the
kings of the earth, which then, when S. John wrote that Reuellation, was Rome,
Reu. 17, 18. And that in it (that is, within the far and wide usurped power and
jurisdiction thereof) was found the blood of all the Prophets and Saints, that
were slain upon the earth, Revel. 18, 24. No marvel then, if the Romans,
beginning so cruelly with Christ, and ioining with the Jews to crucify the
Lord of glory, hold on still in all impious and superstitious rage against the
true christians: and, being absurd and reprobate in doctrine concerning the
faith, be derided, and detested of all good men, whom Christ's servants shall at
length vanquish most gloriously, and reward them double according to their
works. The spirit of God has commanded so, and we are sure it will be so,
and have good hope to see it so Revel. 18, 6. for their great city (that is,
their former large usurped power over many countries and nations) is already
divided into three parts, Revel. 16, 19: for of that large Romish corporation
some nations are become true Christian protestants, as, England, Scotland,
Germany, Denmark etc. some hold still the Romish religion, as: Italy,
Spain, and the countries under their tyranny; some are neither, as the
kingdoms and countries won from Antichrist by the Turk, Revel. 9, verse 14.
15. 20. with all other Atheists and Sectaries among the two former sorts. The
Lord has graciously begun their ruin in diverse of those ten kingdoms,
which sometime wholly bent their power to assist the Beast, Reave. 17. verse 12.

17. And, as we have heard that those deuillish spirits are gone forth unto the
kings of the earth to gather them (in their holy League, as they call it) to
the battle of the great day (for their usual speech is, that they hope for a
day, but the holy Ghost says) of God almighty: so we look when they shall be
gathered (as blessed be God, we saw a fair beginning in the year 1588, when
they compassed the With such glorious t^tles it pleases the Lord to beautify

setting down Ar^nageddon, adds withal, that it is so called in Hebrewe,
whereby he would have us to search the old Testament for the true sense and
meaning of the story: and so much also he meant by Abaddon before, in which
word he expresses the Prophets thereunto alleged, paraphrastically, the more
to stir up our desire in seeking out the truth.
Ar-mageddon, Reuelat. 16, 16. For Saint John alluding to Magiddon, or
Mageddon, which was a region in Iudaea toward the mediterrane sea in the tribe
of Manasses, calls it Ar-mageddon (the mountain of the slain) and of
purpose adds Ar (mountain) to Mageddon, because of mount Tabor, which being
strongly environed with other near mountains, Ier. 46, 18, was within the
coast of Mageddon, whereon Barak and Debora, with their army, expecting the
coming of Sisera, most wonderfully discomfited king Iabin, and his accomplices,
the maine Relics of the Canaanites, and most despitefull enemies of Gods
Church, Judge. 4. verse 6. 12. 15. and 5. verse 18. 19. Psalm. 83. verse 9. 10.

In that Mageddon also at the brook Kishon Elias slew the idolatrous Prophets
of Baal, 1. King. 18, 40. The holy Ghost therefore, leading us to that place
and victory, would put us in most certain hope and expectation of the like,
and very rare victories of the idolatrous Papists, the sworn adversaries of
the true Church of Christ. And, for confirmation of this Truth, Debora, by the
power of the spirit, winding in all Gods adversaries together on an heap,
concludes her Epinice or song of her triumph with this acclamation: so let all
thine enemies perish, o Lord. Amen. read Psalm. 83.

Thus have we briefly seen how the Lord God, being before all beginning, and
Psalm. 90, 2.
from everlasting has by his wonderful^ workmanship of the world, declared his
eternal power and Godhead unto men, creating all things for the benefit of
man, and man himself to fear and love the Lord: who, being created in holy
innocence, and made the sovereign of all earthly creatures, wittingly, and
wilfully transgressed the commandment of his Lord, whereby he most justly
procured eternal death to himself, and to all his posterity. But the Lord
unspeakably rich in mercy, found out a Redeemer, even of the seed of the
woman, the Man Jesus Christ the righteous, the very son of God, who, after
many promises of his coming in sundry ages, when the fullness of time was
come, being miraculouslie conceived by the holy Ghost, in the womb of a
virgin, became man, to suffer for man* that death, which all mankind had
rightly deserved, and so both freeing us from the punishment of sin, and
clearing us from the guiltiness thereof, has set us at peace again with God,
and purchased an inheritance immortal and undefiled, and that fades not away,
reserved for us in heaven, and not committed any more to our own keeping (as
it was to Adams) for the Lord himself sustaineth our lot, Psalm. 16, 5. and
keeps us by his power through faith unto salvation, which is prepared to be
showed in the last time, 1. Pet. 1, 4. requiring of us that we should not now
live unto our selves, but unto him, that died for us, and rose again, that we
likewise should rise to a newness of life in holiness, righteousness and
Christian sobriety in this present world, looking for the blessed This is the
true mark of all the godly and faithful generally, both under the old
Testament and the new, a secure hope and expectation of the last judgment in
the second coming of Christ, Luc. 12, 36. and 21, 28. Phil. 3, 20. 1 Th. 1.

hope, and appearance of our Savior Jesus Christ, to everlasting life.

Resolve now thy self, Christian Reader, resign all earthly Christians ought
by the counsel of the holy Ghost, to examine and prove them selves whether
they be in the faith, and feel the spirit of Christ working in them, 2 Cor.
13, 5: for by Christ's spirit of adoption (which is a witness in our hearts
that we are the children of god 1 Ioh. 5, 10. Rom, 8. ve. 9. 15. Ephesians. 1, 13) we
delight in the law of God, and take no pleasure in sin, Heb. 11. 25. but are
grieved with sin, 2. Pet. 2, 8. and say with S. Paul: I do not the good thing,
which I would but the evil, which I would not, Romans 8, 19. And every one, whose
heart and conscience can truly thus persuade him, is undoubtedly the elected
child of God. Where contrarily, the reprobate delight in sin, because they are
of the world, Ioh. 8, 23. and therefore love the world, Ioh. 15, 19. and the
things of the world, as the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and pride
of life. 1 Ioh. 2. v. 15. 16. And shall receive the wages of unrighteousness,
as they which count it pleasure to live delitiously for a season, 2 Pet. 2, 13.
affections, Col. 3, 2. and consult no longer with flesh and blood, but enter
into counsel with thine own soul for the apprehending of this eternal life:
which life, for the marvelous excellency thereof (being that hid treasure,
that precious pearl, Matthew. 13. verse 44. 46) can not be sufficiently
expressed by all the glory of the world. The holy Ghost choosing out the most
precious things that nature can afford, to describe unto us the heavenly
Jerusalem, our everlasting city, says thus: The city was pure gold, like
clear glass, the foundations of the wall thereof were garnished with all
manner of precious stones, the gates of perle, the streets of pure gold etc. It
needs neither Sun, nor Moon to shine in it, for the glory of God did
light it. The people which are saved shall walk in the light of it, and the
kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor unto it, Reu. 21, 18
etc. O how excellent things are spoken of thee, thou city of God, Psa. 87, 2.
The eye has not seen, nor the ear heard, neither came into man's heart the
glorious things, which God has prepared for them that love him, 1. Cor. 2, 9.
These marvelous things (as Saint Peter says) the Angels desired to pry into,
1 Pet. 1, 12. For, indeed, the Angels received first knowledge of Gods eternal
wisdom and purpose in Christ, concerning these things, by the Church, Ephs. 3,
10. And every creature with fervent desire wayteth when the sons of God shall
be revealed, Romans 8, 19, and shine as the sun, in the kingdom of their
father. Mat. 13, 43. For although we be now the sons of God by faith in
Christ Jesus, Gal. 3, 26: yet does it not now appear what we shall be, 1 Ioh.
3, 2. because that through Christian mortification, 2 Cor. 4. verse 10. 11. and
5, 15. we are in this world as dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God:
but when Christ, which is our life, shall appear, then shall we also appear
with him in glory, Col. 3, 3 etc. For the Lord Jesus Christ shall change our
vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, Phil. 3, 21.
and then we shall see him as he is, 1 Ioh. 3, 2. Moses upon mount Horeb saw
but some glimse of the shadowed majesty of God (for else no man has seen God
in his essential glory at any time, Ioh. 1, 18) and the skin of his face so
shone withal, that neither the Israelites, nor Aaron him self, were able to
look upon him, until he had put a visour over his face, Exodus 34, 29 etc.
Elias also upon the same mount, at Gods visible presence, covered his face with
his mantell, 1 King. 19. verse 8. 13. And of all other Moses was once so
hardy, that he desired the Lord to show him his very divine majesty, but that
request obtained would have cost him his life, and in mercy therefore it was
denied him, Exodus 33, 18 etc. But what speak we of man's disabilitie in this
behalf? Neither the Angels them selves are able to behold the Lord in his full
majesty, nor men to endure even the sight of an angel, as we see prefigured by
the face and feeet-couering in Isayes vision, Isa. 6, 2. Seeing then, after
this life, we shall always have the fruition of this excellent and heavenly
glory, which now neither men, nor Angels can sustain, not upon an earthly
mountain in a material Tabernacle with Peter, Mat. 17, 4: but in Heaven, in
that precious and heavenly Jerusalem, Heb. 12, 22. with God the Father, the
Son, and the holy Spirit, that most blessed and glorious Trinity, in whose
presence is the fullness of joy, and at whose right hand there are pleasures
for evermore, Psalm. 16, 11. together with all the goodly company of Angels,
Zech. 3, 7. Heb. 12, 22. and holy Saints, Mat. 8, 11. seeing (I say) we look
for new heavens and a new earth, according to his promise, wherein dwells
righteousness, 2. Pet. 3, 13. and for such a kingdom, Luke 12, 32. for he is
faithful that has promised, Hebr. 10, 23. what manner persons ought we to be
in holy conversation and godliness, looking for, and hasting unto the coming
of the great day of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to judgment, giving
diligence that we may be found in him in peace without spot and blameles? 2.
Pet. 3, 11 etc. And in the mean time, let Moses show us the shortness of this
life, Psalm. 90, 10. And that covetous fool in S. Luke* teach us that the
incerteinty thereof is more dangerous then the shortness, Luke 12, 20. let us
use this world as though we used it not, 1. Cor. 7, 31, for the fashion thereof
is as chaungable as our garment, Psalm. 102, 26. Let the holy ghost persuade us
to carry our selves without covetousness, and to be content with those things,
Read Mat. 6, 25 etc. and Psalm. 37.
which we have: for he has said, I will not fail thee, neither forsake thee,
so that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, neither will I fear what man
can do unto me, Heb. 13. verse 5. 6. And for our continual and assured hope of
the glorious life to come, let us rejoice in the Lord always, Philip. 4, 4. Let
us cast away every thing that presses down, and the sin, that hangs so
fast on: let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking
unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy, that was set
before him, endured the cross, despised shame, and is set at the right hand of
the throne of God, Hebr. 12. verse 1. 2. This Jesus, being the forerunner for
us, is entered into heaven, Hebr. 6, 20. and gone to prepare a place for us,
Ioh. 14, 2. where we have already an interest by Christ our head, as having
our conversation with him in heaven, from whence we look for the savior, even
our Lord Jesus Christ, Phil. 3, 20. Who shall then separate us from the love of
Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness,
or peril, or sword? much less (I hope) shall the love of the world, wife,
children, friends, honor, etc. remove us from this our eternal glory:
persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor things present, nor
things to come, nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of
God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, Rom* 8, 35 etc.

To conclude, courteous Reader, if thou be affected to the Romish religion
(as happily thou might through the deceiuable show of these merchants
counterfeit godliness) I charge thee before God, and his elect Angels, that
thou dearly tender the salvation of thy soul, which Christ has purchased
with his own blood, and that thou settle and ground the certainty of thy
salvation upon the written word of God (and not on the uncertain Traditions of
those crafty merchants) with full assurance of faith firmly stayed in Gods
promises through hope, as the sure anchor of the soul: for so the Scriptures
plentifully teach, Psalm. 56, 11. To, 8, 38 etc. Col. 2, 2. Heb. 6, 19. and 1^.
verse 22. 23.

The word of God is the only rule of a Christians life, Psalm. 119, 9. There
will nothing else sted us at the last day, when we must all appear before the
tribunal seat of Christ, 2 Cor. 5, 10) but Gods own word and promise. He will
allow of nothing, but that which himself has commanded, Deuteronomy. 12, 32. for all
other things (be they never so glorious in the sight of men) the Lord will
answer, Who required this at your hands, Isa. 1, 12. Ier. 7. verse. 22. 23. Seek
therefore in the Bible, and book of the Lord, and read Isa. 34, 16: for,
Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the word of God, and keep it,
Luke 11, 28. Reu. 1, 3. You know whither Abraham sent the richma^s brethren:
namely to Albeit the Law of Moses, and the Prophets were red every sabbath day
in the Jews synagoges, yet did they not understand them, act. 13, 27. and that
because they did not believe them, Ioh. 5, 46. which their unbelief see how S.
Paul says was foreshadowed by Moses veil, 2. Co. 3. 13 etc. read Heb. 4, 2.
read Moses and the Prophets, that so they might be warned to avoid hell
flames, Luke 16, 27 etc. Our Lord told those Pharisees, that in vain they
worshipped God, teaching for doctrines, men's precepts, Mat. 15, 9. He told
those Sadduces also that they were deceived, because they knew not the
scriptures, Mat. 22, 29. Remember Saint Paul's warning, Let no man deceive you
with vain words: for through such things comes the wrath of God upon the
children of disobedience, be not therefore companions with them, Ephesians. 5, 6
etc. And that fierce wrath of god, in punishing the neglect of his word, the
Apostle declares to be, in sending to the disobedient strong Saint John, as it
were in a map, purtrayeth the very picture of this foolish world made stark
mad by the strength of this delusion. and he shows it us (as he might well
do) for the great wonders of Antichrist: for ca^ there be any greater wonder,
then that the inhabitants of the earth should so generally be (...) deceived?
Reu. 13 verse. 8. 12. 13. 14.
delusion to believe lies, 2 These. 2. verse. 10. 11. as we see in our obstinate
Romish Catholics, whose consciences are so cauterized (as the holy Ghost
foretold, 1 Timothy 4. 2) that neither fear of God, obedience to their Prince,
love of their country, persuasion of friends regard of posterity, nor care of
their own souls, can either dissuade them from their damnable opinions, or
yet reclaim them from their deuillish attemptes, But of this their incredible
obstinacy our Savior has forewarned us, saying: that the time should come,
that whosoever kills his Disciples and professors of his word, will think
that he does God service, Ioh. 16, 2. Saint John would seem to yield a reason
of this their unreasonable obstinacy: they (says he, speaking of
Antichristian teachers) are of the world, therefore speak (...) years, yet
the holy Scripturs affirm neither the one nor the other: but rather infer
the contrary, Romans 15, 20 etc. Gal. 2. verse 1. 2. 8. 9. 2 Timothy 4, 16. Yes
(say they) in that salutation (The church which is at Babylon saluteth you, 1
Pet. 5. 13) S. Peter put Babylon for Rome. Yea what will they not allow, so that
they might prove that S. Peter was at Rome? But briefly, for the disproofe of
their Charter, our Lord having asked his disciples who^ they thought him to be,
Mat. 16, 15. Peter (as he was ever very forward in speech) answers in the
name of the rest: Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. Wherefore
our Savior approving Peter's answer and confession, being built upon the head
corner stone Jesus Christ, Act. 4, 11. 1 Cor. 3, 11, and alluding to his name
Peter, which signifies a stone or rock, says to Peter, and in him to the
rest; for as Peter answered for all (for they all believed and confessed the
same, Ioh. 6, 69) so all were answered again in Peter: Thou art Peter, and
upon this rock (meaning, like a wise builder, a sure foundation of a
spiritual building, Mat. 7, 24. 1 Cor. 10. 4. and not, as those foolish
dawbers, Ezech. 13, 10 etc. upon the flitting sands, Mat, 7, 26) will I build
my Church, against which no strength of Satan shall prevail. By the keys is
meant authority and power, Isa. 22, 22. Reu. 3, 7. And here mark well the
words of their pretenced charter: Christ says, I will give unto thee the keys
etc. he says not, I do give: for notwithstanding this true confession of
Peter, Peter's Peter was then as unfit to receive the keys, as he was unable at
Christ's passion to follow Christ in sufferings, which thing yet afterward he
must do. Ioh. 13, 36. and 21, 19. 2 Pet. 1, 14.
unfitness then to receive the keys was such, that within four verses after
in the same Chapter, Christ's very next words to Peter are these: Get thee
behind me Satan: Thou art an offense unto me, because thou understand not
the things that are of God, but the things that are of men, Mat. 16, 23. And
Peter only of all the Apostles, a good space after this, denied with an oath, and
that at the instance of a silly gerle, that ever he had any acquaintance with
Christ, Mat. 26, 74. we see therefore that though they will have here their
Charter ingrost, yet was it the^ neither delivered, nor under seal: but both
were don after Christ's resurrection, and at the time of sealing and delivering,
Christ delivered these keys of binding and loosing sins, as well to all the
other Disciples, as to S. Peter, Ioh. 20. verse. 22. 23. As likewise they have
ever been in the church of God Jude ver. 14. 2 Pet. 2, 7. Ier. 1, 10. And There
are then no keys for the pope, but that one keye of the bottomless pit. Reu.
9, 1 etc.
are in all the just ministers of Gods word, and always shall be, Mat. 18. verse
17. 18. 1 Cor. 5, 4 etc. 2 Cor. 2. verse 7. 15. and 10, 4. 1. Tim. 5. verse 20.
24. Iud. verse. 22. 23. Yea, though their privilege were good (as we see it
counterfeit and common) yet must it either be personal, or local, or mixed of
both. If it be personal, it perished with Peter: if local, what place shall
ever be of so great privilege and prerogatives, as was mount Sion, Jerusalem?
what special covenants? Sions prerogatives.
what excellent promises had she? God has laid his foundations among the holy
mountains: the Lord loved the gates of Sion above all the habitations of
Jacob. Of Sion it shall be said, many are borne in her, and the Most-high shall
stablish her etc. Psalm. 87, 1 etc. For the Lord has chosen Sion, and loved to
dwell in it, saying: This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell, for I have a
delight therein, etc. Psalm. 132, 13 etc. And the Jews were not a little proud
hereof, Ier. 7, 3 etc. but Gods promises to Jerusalem were conditional: if thy
sons keep my covenant etc. Psa. 132, 12. for else it should be served as
Shilo was, Ierem. 7, 14. Jerusalem should be counted as Sodom, Ezech. 16.
verse 48. 53. Read 2 King. 23, 27.
and Sion for their sake, should be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem become as
heaps, Micah 3, 12. And touching local worship, our Savior has taught us in
his communication to the woman of Samaria, that the true worshippers of God
should look for none, Ioh. 4. verse 20. 21. 23. for men may, and must, pray in
every place, listing up pure hands without wrath and Mat. 21. verse 21 22.
James 1, 6.
doubting, 1 Timothy 2, 8. 1 Cor. 1, 2. To come then to their Church, how is their
church the Church of Christ, seeing they reject the word of God, as they do?
Our Savior reasons thus against the Jews: He that is of God, hears Gods
words, ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God, Ioh. 8, 47. If
all men be bound to allow this reason (as upon pain of damnation they are) how
is the Church of This is meant of their visible and out ward Church, for else
there are among them many (no doubt) who fearing God and embracing his word,
abhor the Beast, and detest his religion, as were in that corrupt time of
Ahab, 1 king. 19 ver. 10. 18. Romans 11 ver. 3. 4. And good Obadia, a chief
officer in Ahabs Court, 1 king. 18, (...) and in S. Paul's time, they of Neros
household at Rome, Phil. 4, 22.
Rome a member of the Church of God, since it refuses to hear his word? as
we see by practice in their Recusants are to be compelled to come and hear
the word of God, Lu. 14, 23. by these examples, Josh. 24 23 etc. 2 Chro. 34,
33. Ezra 7, 26. Ne. 10. ve. 1. 28 etc. And by these warrants, Exodus 22, 20.
Nom. 9, 13. Deuteronomy. 13, 12 etc. and 17, 2 etc. Isa 8, 20. Zec. 13, 2 etc. for
like as by their refusing to hear Gods word, they show them selves not to be
of God, as our Lord testifies Ioh. 8, 47: eue^ so, through the same refusal,
their prayer and divine service is abominable in Gods sight, as the holy Ghost
witnesses, Prou. 28, 9. And even to worship the living God otherwise then he
prescribes in his word, is all one thing unto him, as to serve Idols, and
strange gods only, as we may see, Exodus 32. ve. 1. 4 etc. and 1 king. 12, 28.
and 2 king. 17. verse 28. 29. 32 etc. where those calfeworshippers, in show of
the Calfe, pretended the worship of the true God, as plainly appears by
Aarons Holy Day to the Lord, Exodus 32, 5. and by Ieroboams crafty tendering
the peoples far iourneyes to worship God at Jerusalem 1 king. 12, 28. Also in
Ezech. 43. verse 7. 8. and Zephan. 1, 5. they mingled their image worship with
Gods service. And therefore Act. 7. verse 43. 44. Gods Tabernacle is called the
Tabernacle of Moloch, because the Jews in the wilderness worshipped God with
Moloch, the Idol of the Ammonites, Leuit. 20, 2 etc. Amos 5, 25. for what
agreement has the Temple of God with Idols? 2 Cor. 6, 16. And because our
Recusants are Idolaters, and Image-seruers, and therefore can spiritually
neither see, nor understand, as the holy Ghost testifies, Isa. 44, 18. Psalm.
115, 8. 2 These. 2, 10 etc. they are the more to be constrained, and pitied by
compulsion, 2 Timothy 2. verse 25. 26. Jude verse 23.
Recusants, and in other open contempts. Which thing doubtless they do,
because the word is not marked with the mark, name and image of their Beast,
and, the number, and print of his name, Revel. 13. verse 16. 17. and 14, 11.
which is, to be read in Latin: to carry the private exposition of their
Church: to be mingled with the wormwoodish and bitter waters of their
Church-traditions etc. Reu. 8, 10 etc. And because also that they take their
Church to be above Gods word: for the holy Scriptures lie under the check
(forsooth) of their Church. But the word of God shall judge them in the last
day, Ioh. 12, 48. dare they then control their judge? Exo. 22, 28. Again, how
may their Church over rule the holy Scripturs, since it is Gods word that must
either approve it the Church of Christ, or convince it the synagogue of Satan?
Ioh. 7, 17. Romans 6, 17. 1 Io. 4, 1. 2 Ioh, verse 10. And we have seen, in the
beginning of this Treatise, that the time was, and that since man's Creation,
when there was no Church at all. viz. when Adam and Eve, being Satan's
bondslaues, were hid in the bushes: and til they heard the word of the promise
of redemption, they were no members of Gods Church. But by faith only in that
word of God, they were regenerate into the Church of Christ, as Saint Peter
speaks, 1 Pet. 1, 23 Therefore the doctrine of the Catholics is most absurd
to teach that the Church, being begotten by the immortal seed of Gods word,
may after dare (like a malapert impe) to control, or infringe the authority
of that word, and to presume to over rule it. But we silly souls cannot see
that their The Papists pretend Christ's promise for this spirit, Ioh. 14, 26 but
our Lord promises, that the holy Ghost should suggest only that, which
himself had taught (read the place) now Christ and his Apostles taught nothing
but out of the law and the Prophets, Luke 24, 44. Act. 26 22. Therefore their
spirit teaching otherwise, is a cosoning counterfeit.
priui-pro^pt-spirit instructs their Church of higher, and more excellent
things, then the holy Scriptures avouch: among which (I trow) are these: That
their Pope cannot err: That the Virgin Marie, and Saints departed this life,
must be prayed unto: That images (not Idols) must be worshipped, That a
Catholic is not bound to keep faith, and truce with an heretic (for so it
pleases them to call the professors of Gods word) etc. which absurd assertions,
and all other their private doctrines taught under the title of that spirit, by
the authority of their church, they hold and maintain with no better reason,
or more sure ground, then the Jews do the Traditions of their Cabal is the
I^wes mystical doctrine, delivered from one to another by tradition, which (as
they affirm) was not committed to writing, as was Gods Law: but delivered by
Moses to their forefathers by word of mouth.
Cabal, or Mahomet the ceremonies of his Alcoran is a book containing the law,
and religion of Mahomet, with out the knowledge whereof the Turks teach that me^
are but children in understanding concerning religion.
Alcoran. And as it were hard for man to deem which of these three
abominations have sent mo millions of souls to hellfire: so were it as uneath
to say, which of the three be more hateful in Gods sight, were it not that the
Pope has greater light to his heavier judgment at the last day. And when our
Papists, maintaining these, and more gross opinions, and crossing the word of
God, be the true members of Christ's Church: then shall those Jews be the
children of Abraham, who yet bare no resemblance of Abraham's faith, and
therefore our Lord told them, that they were of their father the Devil, Ioh.
8. verse 39. 44. Wherefore we will end with this fearful Caveat to them all, A
Caveat to the Catholics.
That the state of a resolute and perfect Papist, not repenting his religion,
but dying so insected and possessed with the poison of Papistrie, is
undoubtedly a ruled case in the holy Scriptures, and stands damnable by their
censure, as these, and such like places of the new Testament give manifest
evidence, 2 These. 2, 3 etc. 1 Timothy 4, 1 etc. 2 Timothy 3, 1 etc. 2 Pet. 2, 1 etc.
Reu. 13, 8. and 14. verse 9. 10. and 15, 2. and 20. verse 4. 5. Seeing then
their case is so perilous, let us hear once again the triple testimony of
Gods spirit thus mercifully Ephesians. 5, 7.
forewarning us: Be not therefore companions with them. Turn away therefore 2 Timothy 3, 5.
from such. And, by a voice from heaven: Go out of her, my people, that ye be
not Revel. 18, 4.
partakers in her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.

Amen. He that has ears to hear let him hear, Pro. 20, 12. Ezech. 12, 2.
