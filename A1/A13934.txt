(...) Their study is corrupt and vain.
not one of them does good
The lord beheld from heaven high
the manners of mankind:
and saw not one that sought about.
his living god to find.
They went al wide and were corrupt
and truly there was none:
That in the world d^d any good,
I say there was not one.
Did they know god or worship him,
that were so swiftly lead?
My people to devour and spoil,
and eat them up like bread.
But they shall feel a fearful time,
when god shall say to them:
Standing among the company,
of good and righteous men.
Ye mocked the counsel of the port
on god when they did call:
But they did put their trust in god,
and he did help them al,
But who shall give the people health.
and when will thou fulfill:
The promise made to Israel
from out of Sion hill.
And turn their thral to liberty,
in bond that long are lad:
That Jacob may therein rejoice,
and Israel be glad.
Domine quis habitahit. psalm.xv*
To those that lead a godly life
the Lord does promise rest*
The fruits of al their fained faith*
are lively here expreste.
O Lord within thy tabernacle,
who shall inhabit still,
Or who^ will thou receive to rest
in thy most holy hill?
The man whose life is incorrupt,
whose works are just and straight,
whose heart does speak the very truth
whose tongue does no deceit.
Nor to his neighbor does none ill
in body goods or name:
Ne seeks not to bring his friend,
to take rebuke and shame.
That in his heart regards not
malicious wicked men:
That at the last I shall be sure,
my flesh in hope shall rest.
Thou will not leave my soul in hell
for Lord thou love me:
Nor thou will not give thy holy one,
corruption for to see.
But rather to the path of life*
wilt gladly me restore:
For at thy right hand is my joy,
and shall be evermore.
Exauds domine, psalm, xvii.
Gods church man's doctrine does despise,
his word alone to trust:
The worldly wish none other wealth,
but here to live at lust
O Lord hear out my right request,
attend when I complain:
And hear my prayer that I put forth
with ^ppes that do not feign.
And let the judgment of my cause
proceed always from thee
For thou do ponder and perceive,
what thing is equity.
Search out and try me in the night
and thou shall nothing find;
That I have spoken with my tongue
that was not in my mind.
But from the words of wicked me^
and paths perverse and ill:
For love of thy most holy word,
I have refrained still,
Then thy paths that be most pure
Lord thou may me preserve:
That in the way wherein I walk,
my steps may never swerue.
For I do call to thee O Lord,
for succor and for aid:
Then here my prayer and way right well
the words that I have said.
Be good to those that trust in thee,
and in thy faith do stand:
But pity not those that resist,
the power of thy right hand.
And keep me Lord as thou would keep,
the apple of thine eye:
And under covert of thy wings,
defend me secretly:
From wicked men that trouble me,
and daily me annoye.
And from my foes that go about,
my soul for to destroy:
Which flow in their worldly wealth
so full and eke so fat:
That in their pride they do not spare,
to speak they care not what.
they lie in wait where I should pass
with craft me to confound:
and musing mischiefs in their minds
they cast their eyes to ground.
Much like a Lion gredely,
that would his pray embrace:
Or lurking like a Lions whelpe,
within some secret place.
Up Lord and ouerturne these folk
disperse them like a god,
Redeem my soul from wicked men,
which are thy sword and rod.
I mean from worldly men to whom
al worldly goods are rife:
That have no hope nor part of joy,
but in this present life.
But of thy store for to be filde,
with pleasures to their mind:
And to have children unto whom,
they may leave al behind.
But I shall come before thy face,
both innocent and clear:
And al my joy shall be when thou,
In glory shall appear.
Celt enarrant. psalm. xix.
Al creatures set gods glory forth,
his word and law does fill:
The world through out as honey sweet,
conu^erting souls from ill.
THe heavens and the firmament
do wonderously declare:
The glory of god omnipotent,
his works and what they are.
Each day declares his course,
another day to come,
And by the night we know likewise,
a nightly course to cunne.
There is no langage tongue, nor spech
where their sound is not heard:
In all the earth and coasts thereof,
their knowledge is conferde.
In them the Lord made royally.
a settle for the sun:
Where like a giaunt joyfully,
he might his journey run.
And all the sky from end to end,
he compast round about:
No man can hide him from his heat
but he will find him out.
So perfect is the law of god
his testimony sure:
Converting souls and makes wise,
the simple and obscure,
Just is the judgment of the lord,
and gladeth heart and mind,
Pure his precept and gives light,
to eyes that be full blind,
The fear of god is very clean,
and does endure for ever,
the judgments of the Lord are true
and righteous altogether.
And more to be embrast of thee,
then fined gold I say,
The honey and the honey comb
are not so sweet as they
By them be al thy servants taught
to have thee in regard:
And in performaunce of the same,
there shall be great reward
But Lord what earthly man does know,
how often he does offend:
then cleanse my soul from secret sin
my life that I may mende.
And keep me that presu^ptuous syns,
prevail not over me,
And then shall I be innocent,
and great offenses flee.
Accept my mouth and eke my heart,
my words and thoughts each one:
For my redemer and my strength,
O Lord thou art alone.
E^^udi^t te deus. psalm.xx.
As god preserved Christ his son,
in trouble and in thrall:
So when we call upon the Lord,
he will preserve us all.
IN trouble and adversity,
the Lord will hear the still:
The majesty of Jacobs God,
will thee defend from ill.
And send thee from his holy place,
his help at every need:
And so in Sion stablishe thee,
and make thee strong in deed.
Remembering well the sacrifice,
that thou to him have done:
And does receive right thankefully,
thine offeringes euerychone.
According to thy hearts desire,
the Lord will give to thee,
And al thy counsel and devise,
full well perform will he,
In thy salvation we rejoice,
and magnify the Lord:
That thy petitions and request,
preserved with his word.
the Lord will his anointed save,
I know well by his grace:
And send him health from his right hand
out of his holy place.
In charettes some put confidence,
and some in horses trust:
But we remember God our Lord,
that keeps promise just.
they fall down flat, but we do rise,
and stand up steadfastly:
Now save and help as Lord and king
on thee when we do cry.
Domine in virtute. psalm* xxi.
Christ's kingdom here he does describe,
with his eternal power:
All that rise up, him to resist
his right hand shall devour.
O Lord how joyful is the king,
in thy strength and in thy power:
How vehemently does he rejoice,
in the his savior.
For thou have given unto him,
his godly hearts desire,
To him thou have nothing denied,
of that he did require.
thou did prevent him with thy gifts
and blessings manifold:
And thou have set upon his head,
a crown of perfect gold,
and when he asked life of thee,
thereof thou made him sure:
to have long life, yea such a life,
ever should endure.
Great is his glory by thy help,
thy benefit and aid:
Great worship and great honor both,
thou have upon him laid.
thou will give him filicitie,
that never shall decay,
And wilth thy chereful countenance,
wylt comfort him always.
For why the king strongly does trust
in God for to prevail:
therefore his goodness and his grace,
will not that he shall avail.
But let thine enemies feel thy force,
and those that thee withstand,
Find out thy foes and let them feel,
the power of thy right hand.
and like an oven burn them Lord
in fire flame and fume,
thine anger will destroy them al,
and fire will them consume.
and thou will rote out of the earth,
their fruit that should increase,
And from the number of thy folk,
their sede shall end and cease,
For why much mischief did they muse
against thy holy name:
Yet did they fail and had no power,
for to perform the same.
therefore shall thou right valiantlye
put them to flight and shame:
And charge thy bowestringes redily,
against thine enemies face.
Be thou exalted Lord therefore,
in thy strength every hour:
So shall we sing right solempnely,
praising thy might and power.
Ad te domine leuani. psalm. xxv.
For aid against her enemies,
the faithful church does pray:
For patience in adversity.
and for the perfect way.
I Lift up mine heart to thee,
my God and guide most just:
Now suffer me to take no shame,
for in thee do I trust.
Let not my foes rejoice,
nor make a skorne of me:
And let them not be overthrown,
that put their trust in thee.
Confounded are al such,
whose doings are but vain,
O lord therefore thy paths and ways,
declare unto me plain.
Direct me in thy strength,
and teach me I thee pray:
Thou art my god and savior
that helps me every day.
thy mercies manifold,
I pray thee Lord remember,
And eke thy pity plentiful,
that does endure for ever.
Remember not the faults,
and frailty of my youth,
Remember not how ignoraunte,
I have been of thy truth.
Nor after my deserts
let me thy mercy find,
But of thine own benignity,
Lord have me in thy mind.
His mercy is full sweet,
his truth the perfect way.
Therefore the Lord will give a law,
to them that go astraye.
For all the ways of God,
are truth and mercy both,
To them that seek his testament,
the witness of his troth.
Now for thy holy name,
O Lord I thee entreat?
To grant me pardon for my sin,
for it is wondrous great.
Who so does fear the Lord,
the Lord does him direct,
To lead his life in such a way
as he does best accept.
His soul shall evermore,
in goodness dwell and stand,
His sede and his posterity,
enherite shall the lan^^.
To those that fear the Lord
he is a firmament:
And unto them he does declare,
his will and testament.
My ears and eke my heart,
to him I will advance:
that pluckte my feet out of the snare,
of wilful ignorance.
With mercy me behold,
to thee I make my moan:
For I am poor and solitary,
comfortless alone.
The troubles of my heart,
are multiplied in deed:
Bring me out of this misery,
necessity and need.
Behold my poverty,
mine anguishe and my pain,
Remit my sin and mine offense,
and make me clean again,
O Lord behold my foes,
how they do still increase,
Pursuyng me with deadly hate,
that feign would live in pease.
Preserve and keep my soul,
and eke deliver me:
And let me not be overthrown,
because I trust in thee,
The just and innocent,
by me do stick and stand,
Because I look for to receive,
my succor at thy hand.
Deliver Lord thy folk,
that be of thy belief:
Deliver Lord thine Israel,
from al his pain and grief.
Ad te domine clamabo. Psalm. xxvii
This Psalm sets out the Phariseis.
with flatryng hearts unclean:
And shows how god is all our strength
by Christ our only mean
O Lord I call to thee for help,
and if thou me forsake:
I shall be likened unto them,
that fall into the lake.
The voice of thy supliaunt hear,
that unto thee does cry:
When I lift up my heart and hands,
unto the heavens hie.
Repute not me among the sort,
of wicked and peruerte:
that speak right fair unto their friends
and think full ill in heart.
According to their handie work,
as they deserve in deed:
And after their inuencions,
let them receive their meede.
They not regard the works of god
his law ne yet his lore:
therefore will he their works and them
destroy for evermore.
To render thanks unto the Lord
how great a cause have I?
My voice, my prayer, and my complaint
that heard so willinglye.
He is my sheilde and fortitude?
my buckler in distress:
My hope, my help, my hearts relief,
my song shall him confess.
He is our strength and our defense
our enemies to resist:
The health and the salvation
of his elect by Christ.
Thy people and thine heritage,
thy blessed word preserve:
Extol thy floke with faithful food,
that they may never swerue.
Aff^rte domino. psalm. xxxix.
As David did the temple deck
with yearthly Sacrifice:
So Christ's church with spiritual gyltes.
Ye must adorn like wise.
Give to the Lord ye potentates,
and Princes of the world:
Ye ra^bes that guide the christen flock
give laud unto the Lord.
Give glory to his holy name,
and honor him alone:
Worship him in his majesty,
within his holy throne.
His voice does rule the waters al,
even as him self does please:
He does prepare the thunder clappes,
and governs all the seas.
Of virtue is the voice of God,
and wondrous excellent:
Of full great purpose and effect,
and much magnificent.
His voice does break in Libanus
the Cedre trees full long.
which for their hyghnes are co^parde,
to mighty men and strong.
whom god will strike with fearfulness,
and make them al as mild
As calves that come to sacrifice,
or unicorns full wild.
His voice deuideth flames of fire,
and shakes the wilderness:
He makes the desert quake for fear
that called is Cades.
His voice does make the wild hearts tame
and makes the covert plain:
And his temple every man.
his glory does proclaim.
He stayed the rage of Noes flood,
and stopped the read sea.
And keeps his seat as lord and king
in his eternity.
the lord does give his people power,
in virtue to increase:
The lord does bless his people,
with everlasting pease.
Beati quorum. psalm.xxxii.
God promises salvation.
to the repentaunt heart:
Of his mere mercy and his grace.
not for the man's deserte.
THe man is blessed whose wickedness,
the Lord has clean remitted,
And he whose sin and wretchedness,
is hid also and covered
And blessed is he to whom the Lord
imputes not his sin:
Which in his heart has hid no guile,
nor fraud is found therein.
For whiles that I kept close my syn
in silence and constrainte:
My bones did waste and wear away,
with daily moan and plainte.
For night and day thy hand on me
so grievous was and smarte:
that al my blood and humors moist,
to dryness did convert
But when I had confessed my faults
and shroue me in thy sight:
My self accusing of my sin,
thou did forgive me quite.
Let every good man pray therefore,
and thank the Lord in time:
and then the floudes of evil thoughts
shall have no power of him.
When trouble and adversity,
do compass me about:
Thou art my refuge and my joy,
and thou do rid me out.
I shall enstruct thee, says the Lord
how thou shall walk and serve.
And bend mine eyes upon thy ways,
and so shall thee preserve.
Be not therefore so ignorant,
as is the ass and mule:
whose mouth without a reign or bit,
ye can not guide or rule.
For many be the miseries,
that wicked men sustain:
Yet unto them that trust in God,
his goodness does remain.
Be merry therefore in the Lord,
ye just lift up your voice:
And ye of pure and perfect heart,
be glad and eke rejoice.
Benedicam dominum. psalm.xxiiii.
The prophet David prayseth god*
warning us to forbear.
From evil, and exhorts us
to live in goodly fear.
I Will give laud and honor both
unto the Lord always:
And eke my mouth for evermore,
shall speak unto his praise.
I do delight to laud the Lord,
in soul and eke in voice:
That simple men that suffer pain:
may here and so rejoice.
therefore se that ye magnify,
With me the living Lord:
And let us now exalt his name
together with one accord.
For I may self besought the Lord,
he answer me again:
And me delivered incontinent,
from al my fear and pain.
Who so they be that him behold,
and show him their unrest:
He dasheth not their countenance,
but grants their request.
Who so in their afflictions,
unto the Lord does call:
He hears their suite without delay,
and riddeth them out of thral.
The angel of the Lord does pitche
his tents in every place:
To save al such as fear the Lord,
that nothing them deface.
Se and consider well therefore,
that god is good and just:
And they be blessed that put in him,
their only faith and trust.
Fear ye the Lord his holy ones,
above al earthly thing:
For they that fear the living Lord,
ars sure to lack nothing.
the mighty and the rich shall want,
yea thrust and hunger much:
But as for them that fear the Lord
no lack shall be to such.
Come nere therefore my children dear
and to my word give ear:
I shall you teach the perfect way,
how you the Lord should fear
Whosoever would lead a blessed life,
must earnestly devise:
His tongues and lips from al deceit
to keep in any wise.
And turn his face from doing ill,
and do the godly deed:
Enquire for peate and quietness,
and follow her with speed,
For why the eyes of god above,
upon the just are bent:
His ears likewise are given much,
to hear the innocent.
the lord does frown and bend his brows,
upon the wicked train:
And cutteth away the memory,
that should of them remain.
But when the just does call and cry
the Lord does hear them so:
That out of pain and misery,
forthwith he lets them go.
The Lord is kind and merciful,
to such as be contrite:
He saves also the sorrowful
the meke and poor in spirit.
Full many be the miseries,
that righteous men do suffer,
But out of al adversities,
the Lord does them deliver.
the lord does so preserve and keep,
the bones of his always:
That not so much as one of them,
does perish or decay.
the wicked die full wretchedly,
they seek none other boot:
And those that hate the righteous me^
are plucked up by the root.
But they that fear the living lord,
the Lord does save them sound:
And who that put their trust in him,
nothing shall them confound.
Beatus qui intelligit, psalm.xli.
The Lord will help that man again*
that helps poor and weak:
The passion here is figured,
and resurrection eke,
THe man is blessed that careful is,
the nedie to consider,
For in the season perilous,
the Lord will him deliver.
the lord will make him save and sound
and happy in the land
And he will not deliver him,
into his enemies hand.
And in his bed when he lies sick,
the lord will him restore:
And thou O Lord wylt turn to health
his sickness and his sore.
And in my sickness thus say I,
have mercy Lord on me:
And heal my soul which is full woe,
that I offended thee.
Mine enemies gave me ill report,
and thus of me they say:
When shall he die that al his name
may vanishe quite away.
And where as they go in and out,
for to behold and see:
they muse much mischief in their hearts
what so their sayings be.
Mine enemies run against me still
together on a thronge:
To take a counsel and conspire.
how they may do me wrong
agreing on a wicked word,
and do determine plain,
Be he destroyed with death say they,
he shall not rise again.
the man eke that I trusted most,
with me did use deceyt.
Which eat with me the bread of life,
the same for me laid wait.
Have mercy Lord on me therefore
and let me be preseruede:
That I may render unto them,
the things they have deserude.
By this I know assuredly,
to be beloved of thee:
When that mine enemies have no cause
to triumph over me.
Because that I am innocent,
Lord strength me I thee pray,
And in thy presence point my place,
where I shall dwell for aye.
the Lord the god of Israel,
be praised now therefore,
Which have been euerlastinglye,
and shall be evermore.
Iudica me deus. psalm.xliiii.
The woeful mindeful whom wicked men,
would with their ill infecte:
Does call to god f^r light and truth,
his steps for to direct.
IVdge and defend my cause O lord
from those that evil be:
From wicked and deceitful men,
O Lord deliver me.
For of my strength thou art the god
why put me thee fro?
And why walk I so heauely,
oppressed with my fo?
Send out thy light and eke thy truth.
and lead me with thy grace,
Bring me into thy holy hill:
and to thy dwelling place,
That I may to the altar go.
of god my joy and chere:
And on my harp give thanks to the
O god my god most dear.
Why art thou then so sad my soul,
thus troubled and afraid?
Still trust in god for yet will I
give thanks to him for aid.
deus auribus percipe, psalm
Gods people thewe how wonderssy
he help their fathers old:
And much lament that now from thens
his hand he does wtihholde,
Our ears have hard our fathers tell
and reverently record,
the wondrous works that thou have dooen,
^n alder time O Lord.
How thou did wede the Gentile out
and destroyed them with strong hand
Planting our fathers in their place,
and gave to them their land.
It was not Lord our fathers sword
that purchased them that place,
It was thy hand, thy arm thy light,
thy countenance and grace.
thou art the king our god that help
Jacob in sundry wise:
Led with thy power we threw down such
as did against thee rise,
we trusted not in bow ne sword,
they could not save us sound,
thou kepest us from our enemies rage
thou did our foes confound.
And still we boast of thee our god
and praise thy holy name,
Yet now thou go not with our host
but leauest us to shame.
whereby we flee before our foes,
and so be ouertrode,
yea killed of the heathen folk like sheep
and scattered al abroad.
thy people thou have sold like slaves
(...) open market steede^ (...)
For no reward, as though they were,
of none account in deed.
and to our neighbors thou have made
of us a laughing stock,
and those that round about us dwell
at us do grinne and mock.
the Gentiles talk, the people scorn
we be ashmed to see:
How full of slander and reproach,
our wicked enemies be.
For all this we forget not thee,
nor yet thy covenant brake,
we turn not back our hearts from the
nor yet thy p^athes forsake.
yet thou haste trod us down to dust,
where dens of Dragons be
and covered us with deadly dark,
and great adversity.
and if we had forgot thy name,
and help of ydolles sought,
Then had thou cause us to correct,
but lord thou know our thought.
and how that for thy sake O Lord
we be tormented thus,
As sheep were to the shambles sent
right so deal they with us.
Up Lord why stepest thou, awake,
and leave us not for all:
Why hidest thou thy countenance,
and do forget our thral?
For down to dust our soul is brought
our womb to earth does take:
Arise, help and deliver us,
Lord for thy mercies sake.
Audite gentes. psalm.xlix.
Though rich men do oppress the poor.
discourage not therefore:
For vainly trusting in their goods
they perish evermore.
AL people harken and give ear,
to that that I shall tell:
both hie and low, both rich and poor.
that in the world do dwell:
For why my mouth shall make discourse
of many things right wise:
In understanding shall my heart,
his study exercise.
I will incline mine ear to know,
the parables so dark.
And open al my doubtful speech,
in meter on my harp.
The wicked days and evil time,
why should I fear or doubt?
When the oppressors mischievous
do compass me about:
For some there be that riches have,
in whom their trust is most:
And of their treasure infinite
them selves do brag and boast.
No man can yet by any mean,
his brothers death redeem:
Or make agreement acceptable
unto god for him
Or pay the ransom for his soul,
that he may live for ever,
And taste of no corruption,
this lies in no man's power,
We see that wise men die as soon:
as folishe men and fond:
And both do leave to other men,
their goods and eke their land,
although they build the^ houses fair,
and do determine sure:
to make their name right great in earth
for ever to endure.
We see again it is not given,
with riches to have rest:
But in that point a rich man is,
compared to a beast.
This is the folishe way they walk
with pomp to get them fame,
And al their friends that follow them
do much commend the same:
Whom death will soon devour like sheep
when they are brought to hell:
Then shall the just in light rejoice,
when they in darkness dwell.
Yet for all this I trust that god,
will save my soul from pain:
And from al such infernal power,
and comfort me again.
if any man wax wo^derous rich,
fear not I say therefore:
Although the glory of his house
increases more and more:
For when he dies of al these things
nothing shall he receive:
His glory will not follow him,
his pomp will take her leave.
Yet in this life he takes him self.
the happiest under sun,
And does commend al other men,
that does as he has dooen.
But when he shall go to his kind,
where his forefathers be,
He shall his fellows find full dark,
that light shall never see.
A folishe man whom riches has,
to honor thus prefarde:
that does not know and understand
is to a beast comparde.
Deus deus meus. psalm. lxiii.
Where as christ's kingdom is oppressed.
the just desire of God,
Above al wealth that his pure word,
may freely come abroad,
O God my god I watch to come,
to thee in all the haste:
For why my soul and body both
do thirst of thee to taste.
as drought of earth would water
so I desire each hour:
For to behold thy holy house,
thy glory and thy power.
Thy goodness passes worldly life
and these uncertain days,
My lips therefore shall give to thee
due honor, laud, and praise,
And whiles I live I will not fail,
to worship thee always,
And in thy name I shall lift up,
my hands when I do pray.
My soul is greatly satisfied,
and fares wonders well:
when that thy mouth with joyful lips
thy laud and praise does tell.
Both in my bed I think of thee
and in the evening tide:
For under covert of thy wings,
thou art my joyful guide.
My soul does surely stick to thee
thy right hand is my power:
And those that seek my soul to stroye
the sword shall them devour.
The king and al men shall rejoice,
that do profess gods word:
For liers mouths shall now be stopte,
that have the truth disturbde.
Exurgat deus* psalm. lxviii.
Christ's glorious kingdom is declarde.
and how he should ascend,
The church throughout the world does say,
the Jews law takes his end,
LEt god arise, and then his foes,
will turn them selves to flight,
His enemies then will run abroad,
and scatter out of sight.
And as the fire does melt the wax,
and wind blow smoke away,
So in the presence of the Lord,
the wicked shall decay.
But when the Lord shall come to us,
let righteous men rejoice:
Let them be glad and merry al,
and chereful in their voice.
And singe out laud unto the lord,
his name to magnify:
That sits as a savior,
above the starrie sky.
That same is he that is above,
within the holy place:
That father is of fatherless
and judge of widows case.
that same is he that in one mind,
the household does preserve.
that brings bondemen out of thral,
when wicked men do sterue.
When thou wentest out in wilderness
thy majesty did make,
The earth to quake the heavens drop
the mount Sinay to shake.
thine heritage with drops of grace
full liberally is weashte.
And when thy people mourn and plaint
by thee they be refreashte.
there shall thy congracion dwell,
where thou do poinct the place:
Yea, for the poor thou do prepare,
of thine especial grace.
thou dooest commend thy word O Lord
and give thine holy spirit:
To all that preach thy ghospel pure.
thy glory and thy might*
Kings with their hooftes shall fle away.
thy word shall give the foil:
The household of the living Lord:
shall then divide the spoil.
Then shall the church be innocent,
and white as silver fine:
And in good life more oriently,
then beaten gold shall shine.
When he that rules earthly kings,
the earth shall order so
Then shall the hill of Salmon be,
as white as milk or snow.
Sens Basan is the hill of god,
and fruictful every whit:
Then ye the members of that hill,
why hope ye out of it?
Sens god is pleased wonders well
to dwell within this hill:
And therein does determine plain,
for to continue still.
whose charettes and his angels eke,
be thousands on a thronge:
As in the mount of Sinay,
the Lord is them among.
the Lord ascended up on hye,
and led them bound with him:
That long before in bondage lay,
of death and deadly sin.
And as man received gifts,
and gave them unto men:
yea, to his foes he gave his spirit,
that god might dwell in them.
Now praised be the Lord therefore,
and daily let us praise,
Our god that with his benefits,
does prosper us always.
He is the god from whom alone,
salvation comes plain,
He is the god by whom we escape,
from everlasting pain.
this god will wou^d his enemies head
and break the heary scalpe:
Of those that in their wickedness,
continually do walk.
From Basan will I bring said he
my people and my sheep,
And al mine own as I have dooen.
from danger of the deep.
and make the^ dip their fete in blood
of those that hate my name:
And dogs shall have their to^ges embrewed,
with licking of the same.
al men may see how thou O God,
thine enemies do deface,
And how thou go as god and king
into thy holy place.
the singers go before with joy.
the minstrels follow after,
And in the mids the damsels play
with timbrel and with taber.
Now in thy congregations,
O Israel praise the Lord,
And from the bottom of thy heart,
give thanks with one accord.
Thy chief is little Benjamin
Thy counsel princes been
Of Judah and of zabulon
and eke of Nepthalim.
As god has given power to thee
so Lord make firm and sure
the thing that thou have wrought in us
for ever to endure.
then for thy temples sake shall kings
give gifts to thee always:
Greater then al Jerusalem,
of everlasting praise.
When thou shall wast the wavering folk,
that rage against al right
The stout, the nice, the money men,
and those that love to fight.
Then out of Egypt shall they come
that long have been full blind
Then Gentiles then shall reconcile
to god their sinful mind
then shall the kingdoms of the earth
sing praise unto the Lord,
That over al does sit and send
to us his mighty word.
therefore the strength of Israel
ascribe to god on hie,
Whose mighty power does far extend
above the cloudie sky.
Gods holiness is wonderful,
and drad for evermore:
And he will give his people power,
praised be god therefore.
Quoniam bonus psalm.lxxiii.
He wondereth how the foes of God,
does prosper and increase:
And how the good and godly men,
do seldom live in peace.
HOw good is God to such as be,
of pure and perfect heart:
yet slip my fete away from him,
my steps decline aparte.
and why because I fondly fall,
in envy and disdain:
That wicked men al things enjoy,
without disease or pain.
and bear no yoke upon their neck
nor burden on then back:
And as for store of worldly goods,
they have no want or lack.
and free from al adversity,
when other men be shent,
And with the rest they take no part,
of plague or punishment.
whereby they be full gloriously,
in pride so high extolde:
and in their wrong and violence,
bewrapt so manifold.
that by abundance of their goods
they please their appetite:
and do al things accordinglye:
unto their hearts delight.
al things are vile in their respect,
saving themselves alone,
They brag their mischief openly,
to make their glory known.
the heaven and the living Lord,
they care not to blaspheme,
and look what thing they talk or say,
the world does well esteem.
the flock therefore of flatterers,
do furnishe up their train,
For there they be full sure to suck,
some profit and some gain.
Tushe tush say they to them selves,
is there a god above,
That knows and suffers all this il
and will not us reprove
Lo ye may see how wicked men,
in riches still increase,
Rewarded well with worldly goods,
and live in rest and peace.
Then why do I from wickedness
my fantasy refrain,
And wash my hands with innoce^tes
and clease my heart in vain?
and suffer scourges every day:
as subject to al blame,
And every morninge from my youth,
sustain rebuke and shame.
And I had almost said as they,
mislikyng mine estate:
But that I should thy children judge
as folk unfortunate.
then I be thought me how I might
this matter understand:
But yet the labor was to great
for me to take in hand.
Until the time I went into,
thy holy place and then:
I understood right perfectly,
the end of al these men.
And namely how thou set them
upon a slippery place,
And at thy pleasure and thy will,
thou do them al deface.
then lord how sone do they consume
and fearfully decay:
Much like a dreme when one awaketh
the image passes away.
Thus grieved was heart full sore,
my mind was much oppressed,
So fond was I and ignoraunte
and in thy sight a beast.
Yet ne^^rthelesse by my right hand
thou hold me always fast,
And with thy counsel do me guide
to glory at the last.
What place is there prepared then
for me in heaven above?
There is nothing in earth like the^
that I desire or love.
My flesh and ek my heart do fear.
but god does fail me never,
For of my heart god is the strength,
my portion eke for ever.
And lo al such as thee forsake
shall perish euerychone,
And those that trust in any thing,
saving in thee alone.
Attendite. psalm. lxxviii.
The covenant and the wondrous works
of god in Israel:
And how he troubled them with plagues,
and yet how often they fell*
Attend my people to my law,
and to my words incline,
My mouth shall speak strange parables,
and sentences divine.
which we our selfs have hard and seen
even of our fathers old:
and which for our enstruction,
our fathers have us told.
Because we should not keep it close,
from them that should come after,
But show the power and glory of god
and al his works of wonder.
With Jacob he the covenant made,
how Israel should live,
And made the fathers the same law,
unto their children give.
that they and their posterity,
that were not sprung up tho,
Should have the knowledge of the law
and teach their seed also.
That they might have the better hope
in god that is above:
And not forget to keep his laws,
and his precepts in love.
Not being as their father were,
a kind of such a spirit*
That would not frame their wicked hearts
to know their god a right.
How went the people of Ephraim,
their neighbors for to spoil:
Shoting their darts the day of war
and yet they took the foil.
For why they did not keep with god,
the covenant that was made:
Nor yet would walk or lead their lives
according to his trade.
But put into oblivion,
his rounsaile and his will:
And al his works most magnifique
which he declares still.
What wonders to our forefathers
did he him self diclose:
In Egypt within the field,
that called is Thaneos.
He did divide and cut the seas,
that they might pass at ones.
And made the water stand as still,
as does an heap of stones.
He led them secret in a cloud,
by day when it was bright:
And all the night when dark it was,
with fire he gave them light.
He brake the rocks in wilderness,
and gave the people drink,
As plenteous as when the depes,
do flow up to the brinke.
He drew out rivers out of rocks,
that were both dry and hard,
Of such abundaunce that no fluddes
to them might be comparde.
Yet for all this against the Lord,
their sin did still increase:
And stirred him that is most high,
to wrath in wilderness.
Attempting him within their hearts
like people of mistrust:
Requiring such a kind of meat,
as served to their lust.
Saying with murmuration,
in their unfaithfulness:
Can not this god prepare for us,
a feast in wilderness?
Behold he struck the stony rock,
and flouddes forthwith did flow,
Doubt not that he can give his folk
both bread and flesh also.
When god herd this he waxed wrath,
with Jacob and his seed:
So did his indignacion
on Israel proceed.
Because they did not faithfully,
believe and hope that he:
Could always help and succor them,
in their necessity.
Wherefore he did command the clouds
forthwith they brake in sunder:
And rained down Manna for the^ to eat,
a food of mekil wonder.
When erthly men with angels food
were fed with their request:
He bad the Eastwind blow away,
and brought in the Southwest.
and rained down flesh as thick as dust,
and foul as thick as sand:
Which he did cast a midde the place,
where al their tents did stand.
then did they eat excedingly,
and al men had their filles:
Nothing did want to their desire,
he gave them al their wills.
but as the meat was in their mouths
his wrath upon them fell:
And slew the flower of al their youth,
and choice of Israel.
Yet fell they to their wonted sin,
and still they did him grieve:
For all the wonders that he wrought
they had no fast believe.
their days therefore he shortened,
and made their honor vain:
Their years did wast and pass away
with terror and with pain.
But ever when he plagued them,
they sought him by and by:
remembering then he was their strength,
their help and god most hie.
Though in their mouths they did but gloss
and flatter with the lord:
And with their tongues and in their lips,
dissembled every word.
For why their hearts were nothing bent
to him nor to his trade:
Nor yet to keep or to perform,
the covenant that was made.
yet was he still so merciful,
when they deserved to die.
That he forgave them their misdedes
and would not them destrie.
yea many a time he turned his wrath
and did him self auise:
And would not suffer al his whole
displeasure to arise.
considering that they were but flesh,
and even as a wind:
That passes away and can not well,
return by his own kind.
How oftentimes in wilderness,
did they the Lord provoke?
How did they move and stir their lord,
to plague them with his stroke?
yea when they were couerted well,
of purpose they did move:
The holy one of Israel,
his power for to prove.
Not thinking of his hand and power,
nor of the day when he,
Delivered them out of bondage,
of the enemy.
Nor how he wrought his miricles
as they them selves beheld,
In Egypt and the wonders that,
he did in zoan field.
Nor how he turned by his power,
their waters into blood:
that no man might receive his drink
at river ne at floude.
Nor how he sent them flies and lyce,
which did upon them cral,
And filled the country full of frogs
to trouble them withal.
Nor how he did commit their fruits
unto the Caterpiller:
And all the labors of their hands,
he gave to the grassehopper.
With hail stones he destroyed their vynes
so that they were al lost:
And also their Mulbery trees,
he did consume with frost.
And yet with hailstones ones again
the Lord their cattle smote:
And al their flocks and herdes likewise
with thunder boltes full hot.
He cast upon them in his ire
and in his fury strong:
Displeasure, wrath and angels ill,
to trouble them among.
Then to his wrath he made a way,
and spared not the least:
But gave unto them pestilence,
the man and eke the beast
He struck also the first borne al.
that up in Egypt came:
And all that they had labored for,
within the tents of Ham.
But for all his own dear folk,
he did preserve and keep,
And carried the^ through wilderness
even like a flock of sheep.
without al fear both safe and sound,
he brought them out of thral:
Whereas their foes with rage of sea,
were overwhelmed al.
and brought them into the borders
of his holy land:
Even to the mount which he had purchased
with his right hand.
And there cast out the heathen folk
and did their land divide:
And in their tents he set the tribes,
of Israel to abide.
yet for all this their god most high,
they styrred and tempted still,
And would not keep his testament,
nor yet obey his will.
But as their fathers turned back,
even so they went astray:
Much like a bow that would not be^de
but break and start away.
And grieved him with their hill altars,
their lights and with their fire,
And with their ydols vehemently,
provoked him to ire.
therewith his wrath began again
to kind in his breast:
The noughtinesse of Israel,
he did so much detest.
Then he forsake the tabernacle,
of Silo where he was
Right conversant with earthly men,
even as his dwellinge place.
then suffered he their might and power,
in bondage for to stand,
And gave the beauty of his folk,
into their enemies hand.
And did commit them to the sword
wrath with his heritage:
the yo^ge men were devoured with fire
maids had no marriage.
and with the sword the priests also
did perish euerychone:
And not a widow left a live,
their fault for to bemone.
And then the Lord began to wake
like one that slepte a time,
Or like a soldier that had been,
refreshed well with wine.
with emerauldes in the hinder parts
he struck his enemies al:
And put them then unto a shame,
that was perpetual.
Then he the tent and tabernacle,
of Joseph did refuse,
As for the tribe of Ephraim
he would in no wise choose,
But chose the tribe of Judah
where as he thought to dwell,
Even the mount of Syon,
which he did love so well.
Whereas he did his temple build,
both sumpteouslye and sure:
Like to the ground which he had made
for ever to endure.
Then chose he David him to serve
his people for to keep:
Which he took up and brought away
even from the foldes of sheep.
As he did follow the ewes with young
the Lord did him auaunce:
To feed his people of Israel,
and his enheritaunce.
Then David with a faithful heart
his flock and charge did feed:
And prudently with all his power,
did govern them in deed.
Benedic anima mea. Psalm. lxxiiii.
To god for all his benefits.
we render thanks each one:
Who knows the frayletie of us all,
and helps us alone.
MY soul give laud unto ye lord
my spirit shall do the same:
And all the secrets of my heart
praise ye his holy name.
give thanks to god for all his gifts
show not your self unkind:
And suffer not his benefits,
to slip out thy mind.
That gave the pardon for thy syn,
and thee restored again:
For all thy weak and frail disease,
and healed thee of thy pain.
that did redeem thy life from death,
from which thou could not flee,
His mercy and compassion both,
he did extend to thee.
that filled with goodness thy desire,
and did prolonge thy youth:
Like as the Eagle casts her byl,
whereby her age renews.
the Lord with justice does revenge
al such as be oppressed,
The patience of the perfect man,
is turned to the best.
His ways and his commandments
to Moses he did show,
His counsels eke with his consentes,
the Israelytes do know.
the Lord is kind and mercyful,
when sinners do him grieve,
The slowest to conceive a wrath,
and redyest to forgive.
He chydeth not us continually,
though we be full of strife:
Nor keep our faults in memory,
for all our synneful life.
Nor yet according to our sins,
the Lord does us regard,
Nor ofter our iniquities,
he does us not reward.
But as the space is wo^derous great
twixt earth and heaven above,
So is his goodness much more large,
to them that do him love,
He does remove our sins from us
and our offenses al:
As far as is the Sun rysyng,
full distaunce from his fall.
And look what pity parents dear
unto their children bear:
Like pity bears the Lord to such,
as worship him in fear.
The lord that made us knows our shape
our moulde and fashion just:
How weak and frail our nature is,
and how we be but dust.
And how the time of mortal men,
is like the witheryng hay.
Or like the flower right fair in field
that fades full soon away.
Whose gloss and beautye stormye wyndes
do utterly disgrace:
And make that after their assaults,
such blossoms have no place.
But yet the goodness of the Lord
with his shall ever shall ever stand?
Their childrens children do receive,
his righteousness at hand.
That they might keep their promises
with al their whole desire:
And not forget to do the thing
that he did them require.
The heavens high are made ye seat
and footstool of the Lord,
And by his power Imperyal,
he governs all the world.
ye angels and virtuous men,
laud ye the Lord I say:
That ye may both fulfill his hestes,
and to his words obaye.
His host and eke his ministers,
cease not to laud him still,
And ye also that execute,
his pleasure and his will
Let al your works in every place
give laud unto the Lord:
My heart my mind, and eke my soul
shall thereunto accord.
Ad dominum cum. psalm, cxx.
The good men cry and much lament,
that they so long do dwell:
In company of carnal men*
the sons of Ismael.
IN trouble and in thral,
Unto the Lord I call,
And he does me comfort:
Deliver me I say:
From liars lyppes always,
And tongue of false report.
How hurtful is the thing,
Or else how does it styng,
The tongue of such a liar:
It hurts no less I wene,
Then arrows sharp and kene,
Of hot consumynge fire.
alas to long I dwell,
With the son of Ismael,
That Cedar is to name:
By whom the folk elect,
and al of Isaackes sect:
are put open shame.
With them that did peace have.
I came a peace to make,
and set a quiet life,
But when my words were told,
Causeless I was controlde,
By them that would have strife,
Ad te le^^^i. psalm, cxxiii.
The poor in spirit wait for the Lord,
till they some grace attain:
The proud and wealthy Pharis^^^,
the simple folk disdain.
O Lord that heaven do possess
I lift up mine eyes to thee.
Even as she servant lifts his,
his masters hands to see.
As handmaids watch their maistees hands
some grace for to atcheue:
So we behold the Lord or God,
til he do us forgive.
Lord grant us thy compassion,
and mercy in thy sight^
For we be filled and overcome,
with hatred and despite.
Our minds be sluffed with great rebuke
the rich and worldly wise,
Do make of us their mocking storke.
the proud do us despise.
Beati omnes. psalm.cxxxviii.
God blesses with his benefits*
the m^n and eke the wife:
That in his ways do rightly walk,
and fear him al their life,
BLessed art thou that fear god,
and walk his way:
For of thy labor thou shall eat
happy art thou I say.
Like fruitful vines on thy house sides
so does thy wife spring out,
Thy children stand like olive buddes,
thy table round about.
Thus art thou blessed that fear god
and he shall let thee see.
The promised Jerusalem,
and his felicity.
Thou shall thy childres children see
to thy great joys increase:
Full quietly in Israel,
to pass their time in peace.

fathered on the dead man, and so through his estimation, be the more highly
esteemed. But to chiefly fill up a place, which else should have been void,
that the book may rise to his just volume. And partlye for that they are
fruitful and comfortable unto a christian mind. Wherefore if thou (good

Psalms of David in meter.
Exaltabate domine. psalm. xxx.
The church the ghostly Israel,
Her Lord and God does praise:
Which from the dread of death and hell.
Does her defend always.
ALlaude and praise with heart and voice
O Lord I give to thee,
Which wilt not see my foes rejoice,
Nor triumph over me.
O Lord my god to thee I cride.
In all my pain and grief,
Thou gave an ear and did provide
To ease me with relief.
Of thy good will thou have called back
My soul from hell to save:
Thou do reliue when strength does lack
To keep me from the grave.
sing praise ye saints that prove and se
The goodness of the Lord:
In memory of his majesty,
Rejoice with one accord.
For why his anger but a space,
Does last and slake again:
But yet the favor of his grace,
Forever does remain:
though grippes of grief and panges full sore
do change us over night:
The lord to joy shall us restore,
Before the day be light.
When I enjoyed the world at will,
Thus would I boast and say:
Tushe I am sure to feel none ill.
This wealth shall not decay.
For thou O Lord of thy good grace
Had sent me strength and aid,
But when thou turndst away thy face
My mind was sore dismayde.
Wherefore again yet I cry,
to thee O Lord of might,
My god with plaintes I did apply,
And prayed both day and night.
what gain is in in blood said I,
if death destroy my days?
Does dust declare thy majesty,
Or yet thy truth does praise*
wherefore my god some pity take,
O Lord I thee desire:
Do not thus my soul forsake,
Of help I thee require.
then did thou turn my grief and woe
Unto a chereful voice:
The mourninge wede thou tokest me fro
And made me to rejoice.
wherefore my soul vncessauntlye,
Shall sing unto thy praise:
My Lord my god to thee will I,
Give laud and thanks always.
Exultate iusti. psalm. lx.
To praise the lord with joy they ought
which are accept through faith
God by his word each thing has wrought,
Al men's defense decays.
YE righteous in the Lord rejoice
It is a semely sight.
That upright men with thankful voice
Should praise the Lord of might.
Praise ye the lord with harp and song
In psalms and pleasant things,
With Lute and instrument among,
That sounds often enue stringes.
Sing to the Lord a song most new,
With courage give him praise:
For why his word is ever true,
His works and al his ways.
To judgment, equity and right,
He has a great good will:
And with his gifts he does delight,
The earth throughout to fill.
For by the word of god alone,
The heavens al were wrought,
Their hosts and powers euerichone
His breath to pass has brought.
the waters great gathered has he
On heaps within the shore:
And hid them in the depth to be,
As in an house of store^
Al men on earth both least and most
Fear ye the Lord his law,
Ye that inhabit in each cost,
Dread him and stand in awe.
what commanded wrought it was
At ones with present speed,
what he does will is brought to pas,
with full effect in deed.
The counsels of the nations rude,
The Lord does drive to naught:
He does defeat the multitude,
Of their devise and thought.
But his decrees continue still,
they never slake or swage,
The mocions of his mind and will,
take place in every age.
O blessed are to whom the Lord
A god and guide is known,
who^ he does choose with mere accord
To take them as his own.
the Lord from heaven cast his sight
On mortal men by bearth:
Considering from his seat of might,
The dwellers of the earth.
the lord i say whose hand has wrought
man's heart and does it frame,
For he alone does know the thought,
And working of the same.
A king that trusts in his host,
Shall naught prevail at length:
The man that of his might does bost
Shall fall for all his strength
The heaps of horsemen eke shall fail
their sturdie stedes shall sterue:
the strength of horse shall not prevail
the rider to preserve.
But lo the eyes of god are bent
And watch to aid the just,
with such as fear him to offend
And on his goodness trust.
that he from death and al distres
May set their souls from dread,
And if that darth the land oppress,
in hunger them to feed.
wherefore our soul does still depend
On god our strength and stay:
He is the shield us to defend
And drive al darts away.
Our soul in god has joy and game
Rejoicing in his might:
For why in his most holy name,
We hope and much delight.
therefore let thy goodness O Lord
Still present with us be*
As we always one accord,
Do only trust in thee.
Quem admodum desiderat, psalm, xlii,
the faithful soul afflicted here,
Does sigh complain and cry:
Unto the Lord for to draw nere
Whom wicked men defy.
Like as the heart does breath and braye
the well springes to obtain:
So does my soul desire always,
with thee Lord to remain.
My soul does thirst and would draw nere
The living god of might,
O when shall I come and appear,
In presence of his sight,
the tears al times are my repast*
which from mine eyes do slide,
when wicked men cry out so fast,
where now is god their guide?
For comfort this I call to mind,
And stretch my strength abroad:
that with the holy I shall find,
Health in the house of God.
Enjoying with a joyful voice
There full quiet and rest:
As with a sort that do rejoice.
And celebrate a feast.
My soul why art thou sad and sower
why troublest me so sore?
trust in the lord and praise his power,
That does thy health restore.
when tha^ my soul in me O Lord,
Does fainte I think upon,
The land of Iordane and record,
the little hill Hermon.
One grief another in does call,
As clouds burst out their voice
the floudes of evils that do fall,
Run over me with noise.
But yet the Lord of his goodness,
Does help at al assayes:
wherefore each night I will not cease,
The living god to praise.
I am persuaded thus to say,
to him with pure pretense:
O Lord thou art my god and stay,
My rock and my defense.
why do I then in pensiuenes:
Hanging the head thus walk,
while that mine enemies me opresse,
And vex me with their talk*
For why they pearse my inward parts
with panges to be abhorde:
when they cry out with stubburne hearts
where is thy god thy Lord*
so sone why do thou faint and quail^
My soul with pains oppressed?
with thoughts why do thy self assail,
So lore within thy breast?
trust in the lord thy god always
And thou the time shall see:
to give him thanks with laud and praise,
For health restorde to thee.
Quid gloriaris, Psalm.iii.
The wicked that the Lord despise,
And trust in worldly strength:
With such as use deceit and lies,
Shall Be destroyed at length.
WHy do thy tyrant bost abroad
thy wicked works to praise?
Do thou not know there is a god,
whose strength does last always*
why does thy mind yet still devise,
Such wicked wills to warke?
thy tongue untrue in forging lies,
is like a rasoure sharp.
Of mischief why thou set do mind,
And wilt not walk upright?
thou have more lust tales to find,
then bring the truth to light,
thou do delight in fraud and guile
in craft deceit and wrong
thy lips have lernd the flattering style
O false deceitful tongue.
therefore shall god thy strength co^fon^d
And pluck thee from thy place:
thy sede and rotes from of thy ground,
At ones he shall deface.
the just when they behold thy fall,
with fear will praise the Lord
And in reproach of thee withal
Cry out with one accord.
behold the man which would not take
the lord for his defense:
But of his goods his god did make,
And trust his own pretense.
But I an Olive fresh and grene
Shall sping and spread abroad:
For why my trust al times has been,
Upon the living god.
For therefore will I give praise,
To him with heart and voice:
I will set forth his name always,
where in his saints rejoice.
Deus venerunt. psalm. lxxix.
Here are set forth the soore assaults*
The wicked men invent.
Against gods church which shows her faults
And does to him lament.
O Lord the Gentiles do invade,
Thine heritage to spoil:
Jerusalem an heap is made,
Thy temple they defoyle.
the bodies of thy saints most dear
Abroad to birds they cast:
The flesh of such as do thee fear,
They beasts devour and wast.
their blood throughout Jerusalem,
As water spilte they have:
So that there is not one of them,
To lay their dead in grave.
Thus are we made a laughing stock
Almost the world throughout:
The enemies at us jest and mock,
Which dwell our cos^es about.
will thou O Lord thus in thine ire,
Against us ever fume?
And show thy wrath as hot as fire,
Thy folk for to consume?
Upon those people power the same.
which did thee never know.
Al such as call not on thy name
Consume and overthrow.
For they have got the upper hand,
And Jacobs sede destroyed,
His habitacion and his land,
By them is sore annoyed.
Bear not in mind our former faults
With speed some pity show
And aid us lord in all assaults,
For we are weak and low.
O god that geuest health and grace,
On us declare the same:
way not our works our sins deface
For honor of thy name.
why shall the wicked still always,
To us ss people dumme:
In thy reproach rejoice and say,
Where is their god become?
Requier O lord as thou see good,
Before our eyes in sight:
Of al their folk thy servants blood
which they spilte in despite.
Receive into thy sight in haste,
The clamours grief and wrong:
Of such as are in prison cast,
Sustaining yrons strong.
Thy force and strength to celebrat
Lord set them out of band*
which unto death are destinate,
And in their enemies hand.
The nations which have been so bold
As to blaspheme thy name:
Into their lappes with seven fold,
Repay again the same.
So we thy folk thy pasture sheep,
will praise thee evermore.
And teach al ages for to keep
For thee like praise in store.
Deus stetit. psalm. lxxxii.
God does rebuke the worldly wise.
And tell them al their due.
To such as will his words despise,
He shows shall ensue.
AMid the prease with me^ of might
The Lord him self did stand,
To plead the cause of truth and right,
with judges of the land.
How long said he will ye proceed
False judgment to awarde:
And have respect for love or mede,
The wicked to regard,
Where as of due ye should defend
The fatherles and weak,
And when the poor man does co^tende
In judgment justly speak.
if ye be wise defend the cause
Of poor men in their right:
And rid the nedie from the claws,
Of tyrauntes force and might.
but nothing will they know or learn
in vain to them I talk,
They will not see or ought discern,
But still in darkness walk.
wherefore be sure the time will come
Sense ye such ways do take:
that all the earth from the bottom,
My might shall move and shake.
I had decreed it in my sight,
As gods to take you al,
And children to the most of might,
For love I did you call.
But not withstanding ye shall dye,
As men and so decay:
Like tyrauntes I shall you destroy
And pluck you quite away.
Up Lord and let the strength be known
And judge the world with might:
For all nations are thine own,
To take them as thy right.
Lauda anima mea* psalm, cxlvi.
A praise of god in him alone,
(...) folk should hope and trust,
And not of worldly men of whom,
The chief shall turn to dust.
MY soul praise thou ye lord always
My god I will confess:
while breath and life prolong my days,
My mouth no time shall cease.
trust not in worldly princes then,
Though they abound in wealth,
Nor in the sons of mortal men,
in whom there is no health.
For why their breath does sone depart,
To earth anon they fall:
And then the counsails of their heart
Decay and perish al.
O happy is that man I say,
whom Jacobs God does aid:
And he whose hope does not decay,
But on the Lord is stayed.
which made the earth and waters deep,
The heavens high withal:
which does his word and promise keep.
in truth and ever shall.
with right always he does proceed,
For such as suffer wrong,
The poor and hungry he does feed
And leuse the fetters strong.
the lord does ease the blind with sight
The lame to limbs restore:
The lord I say does love the right,
And just man evermore.
He does defend the fatherless,
The stranger sad in heart:
And quite the widow from distres,
And al ill ways subuerte.
Thy Lord and god eternally,
O Syon still shall raygne?
in time of al posterity,
For ever to remain.
