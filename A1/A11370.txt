in the golden year. M.D. upon the.xxiiij. day of February / which day is
neither named nor no^bred / because it was in the leap year Pronostycate by
Master Solomon the Jew / and Physician greatly soundynge to the honor of God
and lawde of the famous town of Gandt.

The prologe.
Pro. i.
FOr asmoche as the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom / Iaco. i.
And that every good and parfett gift / is given from above / to as many as
ask it in faith / according to the saying of the Apostle. I therefore
(having this fear of the Lord before mine eyes) desire of him / through his
allmyghtye power and endeles mercy / to derecte my pen a right / that this
my little labor and work / may so proceed (according to his most godly
will and pleasure) that I in no wise err from the right way of truethe. For I
have here taken in hand (through Gods permissyon) to pronosticate / of the
very zeal and love / which I bear unto the truth. Taking my ground and
foundacio^ / out of the prophecyes of Esaias / Iermy / Ezechiel / Esdras / with
diverse other / not omittyng that pryncely prophet David / like as I have done
three years paste / but I entende not to pass over so lyghtlye.

First we say / through the mouth of the prophet Esdras. Babylon signifies
a place of sin Asia is taken for the.iij. part of the world stretchi^g from
the northeast / unto egypt. Egipte signifies the whole world so that i^ this
prophecye I do as well co^prehe^de the turks as xp^ians.
Woe be unto the o Babylon and Asia / woe be unto the o Egypt and Syria: gyrde
yowre selves with clothes of sack and hear / and moorne for your children /
be sorry (I say) for your destruction is at hand. A sword is sent upon you
/ and who will torn it back? A fire is kindeled against you / of the fearce
vengeance of God / and who will que^tche it? Behold says the prophet. They
take the word of God but for a scorn / and have no lust there unto. Therefore
I am (says he) so full of thine indignacio^. Oh Lord / that I may suffer it no
longer. For from the least unto the most they hang and depend all upon
couetuousnes / and from the prophet unto the priest / they go all about with
falshead and lies. Again / says Esdras / when men shall think to have peace
unity and concord / and that all manner of vittaylles shall be habondaunt /
and so good cheap upon earth / that me^ shall think the^ selves to be in
good case / eue^ then shall the great myschefe and vengeance of the Lord
fall upon the^ / with wars / death / dearthe pestylences and great
disquyetnes / which are but the beginning of moornyngis and sorrows / In
somoche that the people shall tremble for fear / Joel. ij.
saying now the Lord comes and is hard at hand / A dark day a
gloomynge day / a clowdye day / a stormy day shall appear. Amos. viij.
The songs of the people shall be turned to sorrow / Soche a honger will I
send upon the earth (says the Lord) that no man shall be able to stop it
/ in soche a manner that all me^ may well say / Psalm. c.xxxviij.
where shall I hyde me from the wrath of God? yea they shall say (syttinge by
the waters of Babylon and weape) we will ha^ge our harpes upon the trees that
are therein / as often as we remember Syon. For who escape the war / shall feel
the plage of pestilence / and he that is quyte of the one / shall not escape the
danger of the other. And soche small love shall their be / that one man shall
find no manner of comfort at the hand of an other. Let no man merueyll at
these plages that be to come / seeing they shall be sent of God as scourges for
the punissheme^t of sin. S. Bernardes saying.
S. Bernarde (as it were in the person of Christ) sayethe. O thowe man tell me
the cause af thy mysfortune and chance which thowe haste in thy goods /
body / and soul / Thou seruest the deuell / and not me He has not created
and made the of naught / neither has he saved the / when thowe wast lost /
Christ him self did not redeem the with the son / moon / sterres and
planetes / but with his precious blood through death. Therefore says the
prophet Ieremye / I am constrained to make my co^playnt upon you / and upon
yowre children. Iere. ij.
Oh ye cursed sinners / how woeful a thing will it be unto you / which have
forsaken the true God / falling to sin / the deuell and all vanyties. What
unfaithfulness have you found in me / says the Lord / yowr own conscience
shall accuse you / and yowr own wickedness shall condemn you. Again we speak
unto you / through the mouth of the prophet Esaye. Esaias. i.
Hear oh heaven / harken O earth / for the Lord speaks / I have nourysshed
and brought up children / and they are fallen away from me. An ox knows his
owner / and an ass his masters stable / but my people know me not. Expert
they be in blasphemies / falshed / and lies / most like a froward generation
and unnatural children / as it apeareth euydently enough / with what oaths
they blasphemye God / in every place / as at weddynges / maryages / banckettes
/ feasts / tauernes / markettes / and in many other pastymes / plays / games
/ and soche other things / that by soche deuyllysshnes the deuyne name of God
is openly detracted / sclaundered and blasphemed. Yea in so much that it is so
derided and mocked withal / none other wise / then as men should either put
out their lyppes or point it with their formust finger / with soche
dyshonestie and abhomynable vices and sins / which at this time I shame to
rehearce / so that there be at this present day / many more people living
beastelye and fylthelye / then soberly honestly or virtuously. It neadeth no
probacyon of scripture / seeing the acts be to manifest as well to the rulers
temporal as spiritual. In so much that the confession of faith / true
repentance / and godly Sacraments with the pure preachinge of the Gospel /
is so much neglected and dispysed / that me think it is greatly to be
lamented that it is so long unpunished / for dyshonestie with dysobedience
is so greatly engendered to soche manner of unshamefast boldenes / that in a
manner it is to late to be reformed. And it is to be feared that there be many
sturdy vylleynes / under the color and pretense of beggynge / will do much
more harm / than either Jews / Turks / Agarenes or any manner of kind of
beggars / so that they will not only be content / to beg in the open and
common streates of towns and Cities / as do the lame / dome / and crepell /
nor yet to stand at the church doors and porches / but without any shame
will enter boldelye into me^nes houses and tauernes. And some there be of the
other party / that appear to the people lame / halt and no less then crepell
in deed / that without the towns and Cities / in the feldes will take them to
their fete / layinge away their cruches / some time upon their shulders /
much more redyer to take a purse violently / then to ask for Christus sake
charytablye. Thus see you two manner of beggars / both worthily to be
reprehe^ded and amended. For when the one kind of them has before none /
brought home their prouender / and filled not only their bellyes full / but
even cro^med them up to the throtes / yet must they again at after none / seek
again in the streates / where they may have their bags full against the
next day / so that they go gulpyng like brute beasts / never satisfied. The
other sort bolle and swyll all that ever they ca^ get. The lord which sees
from above / and knows that all these things are true / shall ones judge
that these be even the sheep without wolle. Although there is no man that
takes head of them / yet is it not suffycyent that both these kinds of people
live thus myserablye ydelly and wredchedlye / from whom comes skante one
good word out of their mouths. And it is not a little to be maruayled at /
that these enormyties be unpunished / seeing they so great and intolerable.
But even like as the lynke of one chain draws after him an other / so does
one myschefe and sin draw an other after him. For there is no great sin
that comes alone / but draws by certain occasyons many other euelles after
him / by the which the great indignacyon from the Lord / is cast as a plage
to come upon the dysobedyent / of whom the Prophet David speaks. They
rejoice when they do evil / having delight and pleasure in their evil deeds.
For the wicked when he comes into the danger and deapthe of sin / he
passes nothing at all for it / so that. Romans i.
S. Paull says / that God has given all soche people up into their hearts
lusts / and unto all lewd mind to do soch things which be not comely /
being full of all unrighteous doings / following the foot paithes and steps
of Caym and Judas / with that styfnecked and stony hearted Pharo.
Notwithstanding the goodness and great lyberalyte of God forgeueth the sinner
so often as he falls / to the intent he should repent and amend. Therefore
now ye Christen me^ arise from your sins / and open your ears and
understand with your hearts the words of the Prophet / which says. I am so
full of thy indygnation. Iere. vi
O Lord / that I can suffer it no longer. They take thy word but for a scorn
/ tredinge it under their fete / having no lust thereunto. Power out thy wrath
upon the children that are without thy word / that the man may be taken
prisoner with the wise / the aged with the crepell. For what with the
intolerable burde^s of the scrybes and pharizees / the insaciable and beastly
desires of the adulters and fornicatours / with the unmeasurable couetuousnes /
falsehead / frawde and deceyte of diverse and strange sorts of people / the
church is become (I fear me) a very den of thieves robbers and bloody
murderers. Therefore says the Lord by his Prophet / upon all soche shall
rain solphur / fire and brymstone with wyndes both troublous and tempestious
and all other plages / no less then it was seen upon Sodoma and Gomorra.
Genes xix. Ezechi. xvi. Iere. vi Esa. xxi Ezechi. xxxviij. Psalm. xcviij.
And again speakith the Lord by the mouth of his prophet Esaye. I will power
out upon you (says he) my wrath / and I will cast down upon you the
fire of my vengeance and indignation / with thonder / lyghteninge / hayle and
darkness. So that there shall go a fire before the Lord / which shall consume
and burn up his enymyes on every side. Therefore clothe yowr selfs with sack
clothe / cast ashes upon yowre heads / fast and pray / lament and repent
you of yowre sinful living. Jonas. iij.
For the days of the Lord are at hand / so that every thing which has
been prophesied shall be fulfilled. Ezechi. xij.
Remember what great pytie and mercy / the Lord had over the Niniuytes / after
that they with long lamentation / repentance and fervent supplicacyon /
submitted them selves wholly to him. Also not withstandinge that these.iij. men
/ Moses Aaron and Samuel / offended against the Lord / yet when they
repented and prayed hertelye / the Lord heard them / yet punisshed he their
tra^sgressions / as it appears by Moses which sinned at the water of Strife
/ by reason whereof he might not enter into the land of promys. Nu^e. ij.
Likewise when Aaron made a golden calfe unto the lords people. Exodi. xxxij.
i. Regu^ viij. cha
And Samuel sinned being negligent in teaching of his children. If God have
not spared soche me^ / we then ought to take good head / how we walk in the
p^sence of God. Therefore says the prophet / beware of the plage / and
pestylence of darkness / which is a syckenes that dystroyeth the light of the
day. And if ye will not turn and amend / then the days of sorrow shall
suddenly come / from whose face thowe shall not flee. Genes vij. Psalm. ij.
Thowe shalt call upon the flowdes of the waters / with the hyghenes of the
mountains to hyde the. There shall be soche a cryinge and waylyng amongst the
chrystians / that the one shall say to the other / it were good that we never
had been borne. Insomoche that some shall dysdayne the words of this prophet /
yet is there nothing more truer / then that which is spoken of before. So that
great heauynes and sorrows shall chance / as well upon other staungers and
alyaunt nations as upon the dowche land / wherefore it behouethe me some
thing to speak thereof / that men perceiving the little ship of Peter
(through discord and disobedience) to be rent and broken in pieces / against
the hard stony rocks / shall then the more easyer see these things to be
true and no fables And though there be many which think the natural
inclinacions of the elements to be but fantastical and worthy of no credyte /
yet can they not but grant the ordenaunce of God to be vnfallable / in as much
as it proceeds from the bosom of the father. And here do I both earnestly
and plainly admonysshe the Germanies both high and low to join them selves
unto the Egle / For else there shall arise amongst them / soche war and
discord that it shall not easily be apeaced. For the Turk shall with great
violence go about to destroy the lands of Meyssen / Duryngen and Hesse / as
Merlyn does prophecye / which says by soche means the Emperors majesty
might come to some mysfortune of his body / by reason of the conjunction of
Iouis being in Scorpio. Also other princes and lords of the Romayne Empire /
shall be some thing troubled of their subjects / notwithstanding it shall not
long contynewe. And after that the Emperors majesty has taken great pain
and trouble in trauaylinge from one country to an other / with much
disquietnes and small rest / as well by land as by sea / then shall the
spyrituall sword not be so long / The spiritual sword shall be made shorter.
so broad / nor yet so sharp / to cut with soche violence as it has done in
times paste. And in this time shall the son lose her light.iij. points and a
half great / which shall be upon a Frydaye after. S. Bartholemews day at one
of the clock in the after none or there upon / because Leo having the
asce^dent / signifies to us many fearful wars and great shedinge of blood.
Which as well they of the land of Austriche shall perceive and feale as many
other strange nations. Austriche is under the dominion of Ferdina^do king of
Ho^gary
For Merlyn says that the Turk with great power purposes to destroy the
fore named lands of Meyssen / Duringen and Hesse. Therefore let not this Godly
admonission and plage / which hangs over your heads (good Christen me^) be
forgotten / but rather let it be closed within your hearts / seeing it is none
other wise like / the^ so to come to pass. For as truly as the Lord lives /
great sorrows and troubles are at hand in which the holy prophecies shall be
fulfilled / and the true Christen church shall sore decay / even like as it
chanced unto the congregacyons of the Jews / being in great prosperytie /
felycytie and pride / Hearing the wounderfull things wroughte above in heaven
/ perceyuyng one like a vallyaunt Captain / being in a fyery charret and
syttyng in a stool of gold / having in his hand a sharp spear / and a
voice heard in the entering in of the temple / which said within a very
short time we will depart hence / which sygnifyed the mercy of God to be
withdrawn from the generacyon of the Jews / and it so came to pass / as it
appeared most manyfestlye by the distruccyo^ of Jerusalem / all this not
withstandinge nor nothing at all regarding these visyons they mocked and
derided the^ / as things most false and untrue. And I fear me that as many
of the dowchelande / does esteyme and judge these admonicyons of the prophets
as fables / even so does other lands and nations / which will never repent
/ until the time that those things happen to the^ / as did to the Jews for
their dissobedie^ce. Apoca. xviij. Esa. xij
But hear what S. Ihon says in the apocalips / of them which join them
selves unto the Babilonical strompet Babylon that great city is fallen /
which has poisoned all nations / causyng them to drink of the wine of her
stinking fornicacion. Iere. li.
That mighty and great city Babylon (says he) is fallen / and become the
habitacyon of deuels. And why? because the Kings of the earth have committed
fornicacion with her. Apoco. xiiij.
And her marchantes are waxen rich with the haboundaunce of her pleasures /
yet in one hour (o thou Babilo^) is thy judgment come. Esaie. xiij. Jeremy
xiiij. Ezechi. xxxiiij.
Thy sheaperdes have distroyed and scatered my flock a broad says the Lord
/ feadinge them selves / and not my people. Therefore (says he) I will upon
them / and requyer my sheep out of their hands / and will feade them mine own
self. For how many is there at this day which for the inward zeal which
they bear unto the head of that city of Babylon / take an occasyon (after
the ensample of Herod) to make inquisycion for filthy lucres sake / Mat. i.
for the pore innocent lambs of Christ never leaving of until they have shed
their blood / thynkinge thereby their lordeshippes and Kingdoms longer to
endure. And it is seine at this present day in some places / that although
the name of the head of the Babilonicall city be abolished / yet were his
laws never more auaunced / nor his ministers and adherentes had in more higher
estimacion. I would there were some man that could make the spiritualty to
understand this lesson of Christ well / where he says / mat. xx.
that the Princes and Lords of the heathen / have power over the heathen
people / but it should not be so amongst his disciples / Now then / if they
would harken to this doctrine / and grant them selves to be Christ's
disciples / then can they not look to have soche rule in the world / over
Dukedomes / Erledomes / Cities and towns / in soche ample wise / that worldly
princes / in a manner be nothing to be compared unto them / or at the least
without them. I speak not this in disprayse of the superyour powers / for
eue^ the same Gospel which takes worldelye promocion from the spiritual
powers / does again restore the same to the Ciuyle Maiestrates / the which
ought to be obeyed as well of the spirituality / Roma. xiij.
as of the temperaltye / saying it is thordenaunces of God him self / for the
punisshemente of them that be evil / and maynteyninge of the good. So that who
so ever withstandeth them / withstandeth the ordenaunce of god / saying they be
his mynistres for our wealth and profyt / under whose subjection / God has
instituted all creatures. For he says clearly / Omnis anima / here is no man
excepted / nether spiritual nor te^porall. Roma. xiij.
For where this order is not in the church of Christ / there must the Lord
needs send down his plages and punissheme^tes / according to the prophecy
of Hyldegardus / which says / the time shall come / that the moon shall
lose her light / that is to say.iiij. points / which shall be upon a monday
after vincula Petri / at.xij. of the clock at mydnighte / the ascendent being
in Aquario.xviij. degrees in Libra / which undoubtedly does signify unto us /
that many godly ordenaunces and statutes / which have been made for the setting
forward of gods honor and the publyke wealth / shall be disanulled and broken
/ and other wicked and ungodly acts shall be put in their places. For in this
time shall stand up a false prophet / which shall go about to distroye the
chiefest articles of our faith and belief / and so through an vtwarde and
glorious appearaunce / he shall seduce much people / and work many strange
things. And in this time shall the Emperowrs majesty be vexed and troubled
with many of his subiectis / so that the prisons in every place where men do
use to execute justice / shall be filled / with monks / fryres / no^nes and
soche other / so that they shall live in an uncertain and unsure estate. Ite^
merchants and artifycers / shall not greatly profyt in their affairs / but
that shall not long co^tynewe. Ite^ women shall have good fortune in their
trauaylle and labor / for they shall bring forth many children within short
time. After this shall there be two eclipsis / the one of the Son / the other
of the moon. The son shall be darkened.vi. points great from the beginning
to the ending / which shall be upon a wednesdaye.viij. days after the.xij. day
at after none. And again the moon shall loose her light upon a frydaye after
the conuersyon of. S. Paull in the morning at two of the clock in the.ix.
degree of Leo / which betokens great mischau^ce and fortune to them that
dwell upon the sea coasts / or where the ground is low. In this time men
shall see a great fall and decay of Turks / so that the empire shall have
great rule and domynion / conquerynge diverse lands and lordeships. Ite^ the
nobles of the empire shall have prosperous successyo^ and fortune with great
favor of their subjects. In the mean time shall the spirituality be at
variaunce / strife / and discord / for the promocio^s and goods of the
church. And while they are thus striuinge one against an other / merchants
and all other artyficers / shall have more prosperous and better luck in their
trades and business then they had before. Notwithstanding / Italye / Norway /
and Denmark shall be vexed troubled and be brought to great heaviness. About this
time shall there be in France / in the land of Luke / and in some places of
the land of Cleue / great pestilence and other strange diseases / then shall
the flowdes of the water of Ryne braste forth with great violence / and
ouerflowe diverse parts of the land / to the great discomoditie of the
people. In this time shall the son be darkened.ix. points from benethe upward
/ upon the second friday after Easter after none at.iiij. of the clock.xij.
degrees in the sign of Pisces / so that then thascende^t shall show him self
signifying unto us / that there shall be a great nombre of princes deposed / so
that the crown of the land of Boheme shall stand void / through the great
disobedience of the subjects. And because they do reprove the rod wherewith
they should be beaten / I will therefore (says the Lord) visit their
transgression and disobedience / Amos. viij.
with a sharper rod / that is / with the sword of war pestilence dearthe
and death. Then shall the p^lates of the church be at strife / one against
an other for diverse causes / which I entende not much to entreat of at this
time / but will commit the things unto god / yet will not I over slyppe the
words of that princely prophet David / which says. Psalm. ij.
The kings of the earth shall stand up / and the rulers shall counsel and
come to gether against the Lord / and his anointed. For both Pilate and
Herod / Annas and Cayphas / scribes and pharisees / which seek their own
profet and advantage / with no small dissentio^ and discord / sekyng the
souls of them / Esaye. xiij.
which (the prophet Esaias says) shall not yet dye / They shall right well
perceive the great plages of god / with lamentinge and moorninge as la^pes
with out oil / and lanternes with out light / being both idle / blind and
vayn. Psalm. lxi.
For if they were laid against vanity in a peire of balaunce / they should
fly up unto the sky / and be much lighter then even vanitye it self. Harken
therefore (says the Lord) ye princes of Sodoma / and ye people of Gomorra /
these my words. For the sin of my people / I will (says he) suffer
ypocrites to reign over you. Let us take heed of the wonderful example where
the angel af god did destroy upon one night in the pauillio^s and te^tes of
the Assyria^s.C.lxxxv. thousand me^. iiij. Regu^. xix. Esaie. xxxvij.
For undoubtedly these plages that are to come / shall be for the sins /
which raygne at this day in the world / so that there shall assemble together
in one field / many nobles of great power / which willingly shall go to
battle / where much blood shall be shed / most especially of the wicked /
in soche wise that the third part of the world / shall there be slain. iiij.
Esdras. xv
For I will hold my tongue no longer (says the Lord) saying the people be so
wicked and ungodly / for the innocent blood of the troubled / criethe unto me
/ and the souls of the ryghtuous complain contynually / therefore will I
aue^ge the blood of my people / so that the world shall be full of wofulnes and
misery. The ground shall lie void / and not be tilled / the trees shall bear
fruit and shall not be gathered. The corn that is sowe^ in the feldes / shall
not be brought home into the barnes / the women shall weape and wayle / for
the loss of their husbands / that shall perisshe with the power of the
sword. And more over / Aloufresant prophecyethe / that in this time / the
true christians shall have much persecucio^s / troubles and sorrows / for the
word of God. And after that shall there follow great dearthe / and death / as
well in other places / as in douchelande. The^ shall there come in the coasts of
Europe / soche rain / wind and tempest / that many me^ shall be slain
therewith And this tempeste shall come from the north / so that many shall go at
nights merely to their beds / which shall be found dead in the morning /
and thus ended his prophecy. In this time also shall the papistrie and seat
of Rome stand void / so that the Emperor shall take upon him to ordeyne and
instytute an other in the same seat / to whom the Emperor shall adioyne him
self and make attoneme^t in the church. And the man whom he shall thus
ordeyne / shall be of great worthynes and virtue / and thereto be set like one
of power: so that after that he shall put down / and take away great
possessions / rentes / promocions and dignyties / from the prelates and
prebendaries / forbyddinge all outward vain glorious pomp and pride / as well
in external lyghtnes of rayme^t and apparel both of men and women / as also
the superfluytie of Gold / Silver / pearls / precious stones / and soche like
/ so that he shall will every man and woman according to their vocacyon and
calling to go soberly apparelled / as it becomes the true members of Christ.
Ite^ he shall command the Gospel of Jesus Christ to be preached / through
out all the world / rebukyng all sinful and vicious lyuinge of the people
but he shall not long contynewe. About this time shall there be heard of a
great fall and destruccio^ of the Turks / amongst whom there shall be a great
insurreccion / by the reason whereof they shall be troubled with much myserie and
calamity. For the styrringe up of Saturnus shall work woundersly with them /
to their great mysfortune and chance / so that the Turk shall have but little
courage and comfort to make war against the christians. The spyritualtie
again on the other party / shall be at no small variau^ce and dyscorde amongst
them selves / by the reason whereof many Kings and princes shall take good
occasyon to reform many enormyties / little to their ease and proffyt. For many
of them which think to buyld upon a foundacyon as hard as any rock / shall
find that it is but a very slypperishe sand. Now if me^ of power and renown
/ will build upon these foundacions so uncertain and unsure / yt is no
marueyll / though God do plage them for their wyckednes / that so wylfully
resyste and nothing at all regard these his godly admonissions / which
should move and sterre all christen men to repentance. O Lord how short is
the time of mercy / and how feaw be there that require it at thy hands in
time / which thing obtained / we shall ever live / and never dye? Math. xv.
The woman of canane / called to Christ for mercy / and by and by her
daughter was made hole. Also Job says / that the earth is not only full of
mercy / but heaven and hell / for who has ever called upon Christ for mercy
/ which has not received it of him / so that he have asked it in faith. And
understand that the Emperors majesty Charles the fyfte shall work the Turk
more sorrow the^ any prince has done these.CCCC. years / so that they which
are under the sign of sagittarius / shall preuayll and have great victory /
which shall be the Emperor him self / or one of his blood. And where I might
here speak more of the Emperors majesty / and of diverse things / which shall be
done by him and his nobles / let no man think the contrary / but his acts
shall excel and pass all other princes / if he be not hindered by the
perswasyons of the prelates of the Romayne empire. The prophecye of Cibilla
cumana. Understand by those letters / F E / A and G / the dn^icall and the
leap year. Math. xxiiij.
And to this does agree Cibilla Cumana / speakinge out of the spirit of
prophecy / affirminge it to chaunche betwixt F and E / A and G. Which
prophecy ends at.xlviij. years / or sone after. Before that time there
shall be great change in the world / and strange wonders shall be heard of /
that shall be true / although they shall apeare to many / very incredible. And
the^ more thingis shall chaunche in a very short time / then has been seen
many years before. And the last sign and token after these / there shall be so
great persecution and tribulation / as has not been seen nor heard of /
syns the beginning of the world. And after this persecution / shall the son
be darkened / and the moon shall not give her light / in so much that I do
find especially two fearful Eclypses of the moon / in so much that she
shall lose her light very greatly with in one year / and shall be darkened
from above to benethe / and these Eclipsis shall give unto all nacyo^s / a great
admonition and warninge. For the operation of both these Eclypsis / shall
chaunche between the year xxxvij. and.xlviij. signifying to us / so great
trouble and heauynes to chance unto the spirituality / that I will let pass
to name the hour and day / referringe it unto the judgment of the Lord. And
so far as this cirkell does stretch / so far shall there great disquietnes
be. Apoca. xiij.
So that I would men should note these two figures folowi^g in the Apocalipse.
The first is / I saw a beast rysyng out of the sea / having.vij. heads.x.
horns and upon his horns.x. crowns / and upon his head the name of
blasphemy / by which beast I understand that usurper of Gods laws / and
wicked tyrau^te Antechriste / which has most beastly lived and taught the
people most wicked and beastly doctrine / which has drawn underneath his
subieccio^ vij. the most noblest Realms of the whole world / he that has
cares / let him hear. And I beheld an other beast coming out of the earth
/ and he had.ij. horns like a la^be / and he spoke as great thingis as did the
first / and caused the people which dwelled in the earth to worship the
first beast / whose deadly wou^des was healed by him / let him that redeth
understand. These prophecies are both chanced and fulfilled / and we trust
by the help of God / that these thingis shall be redressed by the Emperors
mayestie / Charles the.v. and his assistentes. After this shall come a good
time / for there shall be a new reformacion / which shall continewe long /
so that the name of the great Turk shall be no more heard of. In this time shall
other fearful things be seen in the son / for upon the second wensdaye
after easter at.v. of the clock in the morning / in the.xxvij. degree / the
sign being in Aries. There shall be soche darkness as has not been seen in many
years before / which signifies that many princes and kings shall rule to
gether in one realm. Miche. iiij.
Then (says the prophet) shall they make of their swerdes ploweshares / and
sythes of their spears / and every man shall sit under his vynearde and fygge
tree / so that one people shall not lift up his weapen against an other /
nether shall they from thens forth learn to fight. Esa. ij.
After that shall the blind Jews know by the declaracyon of the prophecies
of Jacob / that the true Messyas has been borne long and many years agone /
which they unto this day / have looked for his coming. Genes lxxi.
Which prophecy says thus: when messiah shall be borne then shall be taken from
the Jews their scepter and crown / and they shall be ruled of the Romysshe
Empire: which so chanced after the death of Christ. And through Titus and
Vespasianus they were brought under the subjection of the Emperor of Rome. And
now I trust (through the goodness of almighty God) that it shall be as well
declared unto the Jews / as it has been believed of the Christians / that
Messiah is come already So that then (after the destructyon of the Turks) they
shall be all converted unto the christian belefe / and the Gospel shall be received
with all diligence. And this is the good will and mind / of the most redoubted
Emperor and godly prince Charles / and that not only in word / but also in
heart and deed. For this purpose has the almyghtie God ordained so many godly
and excellent co^treys underneath his gouuernau^ce / to the intent that the pure
and undefiled word of god might be preached and syncerely taught / through out
all his lands / to the honor of God and salvation of mankind. Whereby it
shall appear (I trust) to all his true subjects / to cause them to take the
more courage / to the further increase of virtue / and preseruacyo^ of his
excellent majesty. Blessed be that hour when this shall come to pass / and
blessed be all they which shall aduau^ce and set forward these things before
rehearced unto all nacyons. For the which let us all pray with one heart and
mind / that this Gods honor and our salvation may be obtained / peace
increased / and al consciences quyeted. For the Lord knows what creatures we
be / saying / We are but ashes / and to ashes shall we return again / and
as we brought nothing into this world / so shall we carry nothing away with us.
Gen^. iij Ezechi. xvij.
Here with I make an end / and take my leave / never more entendyng after this
to pronosticate / but will counsel all men in the stead of pronostications to
imbreace Gods word / which is able to save your sowles / according to the
saying of the apostell. Ia^^. i.
And all though in this pronosticacio^ / I speak most specially of those
things / which are like to chance (by the natural inclinacio^s of the
planetes) in douchelande / yet were it good for all other lands and realms /
here with to be admonisshed and take good head / for where so ever the Lord
is most dishonored and his word resisted / there will he first strike and plage
/ and if there be any (as perchance there will be some) which will say (tush)
this pronosticator is no wiser then mad Marlyn and soche other false and
profane fabelers / as he does here in allege the^ for his authors / well /
admit that both they and I were liars (as in dead we are no other) yet is the
Lord rightuous and trwe / which will smite the world with his staff and
rod / and with the breath of his mouth / he will destroy the wicked. Genes
xlix
But here will some men peradventure object and say / that these great
threats and plages of god before rehearsed and spoken of by the prophets /
were prophesied against the wicked and disobedient Jews / against Sodoma and
Gomorra / against their princes preistes cities and cou^tres / which things
were fulfilled many honderd years paste / as at the destruction of Jerusalem
and soche other. Well / against all soch that thus arroga^tly will reason
against the Lord / will he him self whette his swearde / bend his bow /
and make ready his arowes / to shoot at those disobedient people / which
co^tinewe still in their sins with much more abhominatio^ / the^ ever did
these heathen or ungodly Jews. And let no man think / that his sword is any
shorter at this time ageynste them that will not repe^te and amend / then it
was in time paste. For trwly / the sins which raygne at this day in the
world / do greatly provoke the plages and vengeance of god to come shortly
upon us. And though owr gracious god be a long sufferyng god / yet at length
he punissheth / and that with great violence / according to the saying of the
prophet Naum / where he says. Nau^. i.
The Lord takes ve^geau^ce upon his enemies / and reserueth displeasure for
his adversaries / there is no power nor prince / that can withsta^de the Lord
of hosts / for look what he says / it is done / and what he commands / it
stands fast. Psalm. xxxij.
There is no counsel which shall long prevail / if it be against the Lord
/ according to the saying of the prophet David / speakinge on this wise. The
Lord brings the counsel of the unfaithful to naught / and turns the
devices of the people / but the counsel of the Lord endures / and the
thoughts of his heart / from generation to generation. A king is not helped
(says he) by his own great hooste / nether is a Giau^t saved throuh the
might of his own streangth. Psalm xxxiij. Nau^. i.
Let us now therefore fear the Lord / for at the sight of his displeasure /
all the world shall shake and tremble for fear who may abide his displeasue /
or ones flee from his indignacion? his anger takes on like fire / so that the
hard rocks (says the prophet) at his displeasure braste in sonder. Esa. xi.
Therefore all true and faithful christians / lament and morn / for the day of
the lord is at hand / which comes as a distroyer from the almighty. Esaye.
xiij.
The^ shall all hands be lette^ down and all me^nes hertes shall melte away /
carefulnes and sorrow shall come upon the^ / and their faces shall burn like the
fla^me / because (says the prophet) the day of the Lord shall be so terrible /
that his indignacio^ and wrath shall be cast upon the face of thearth / to make
it waste / and to root out the sin thereof. Hear what the Lord says / by
the mouth of his prophet / Woe be to all the^ (says he) that make unrighteous
laws / Esai. x.
deuisinge things to hard to be kept / whereby the pore are opp^ssed on every
side / and the innocent people ar therewith robbed of judgment / the widows
made a pray / so that the fathirles be spoiled of their goodis. Job. xij
This may alme^ see how the godly and innocent be entreated and laughed to
scorn / and the houses of robbers be in wealth and prosperity. The Lord
everlasting / which has the hertes of all kings and princes in his hand / to
turn the^ where ever he will / preserve the Emperors most noble majesty /
with all kings and princes and stablisshe the^ with great honor and long
life / to promote the gospel of Christ. Ame^.

Let every man fear the day of the Lord / for it is hard at hand.
