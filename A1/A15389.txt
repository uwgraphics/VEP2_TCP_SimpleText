western Will, upon the debate betwyxte Churchyard and Camel.



Row thy bote thou ioly ioly maryner, and wynd well up thy sail,
For thou might never wind it up better thine own self for to avail.

THere ware three merry maryners, that dwelt in Maldon meade
That could sail of wind and tide, of chanel and of stream
And eke their compass well dyrecte, from every shore and stead
And ware acqueinted with the rocks: and sands yt might them queame
From Maldon haven to Billingesgate, as well I undertake
As any three of many years, such course that used to make.
A Crayer had they pressed to sail, and all their takle yare
And all their fraught ybrought a board, to wend to Maldon town
But for the wind was not the best, before they forth would fare
They thought the city for to rowme, and view it up and down
If thing uncouth they there might find, wherwt to move some glee
When they came home to Maldon meade, among their company.
To Powles they hyed as place most fytte, for news in their deuyce
Among the prynters began they search, and busily inquire
For things that might for Novelty, at home be had in price
The printer said he thought he had, to pleasen their desire
And drew them nere into his shop, and began unfold them light
A roll of Rythmes, whereof the first, the dickers dream it hight.
Then followed answer to this dream, to Dauie dickers when
A solemn process at a blusshe, be quoted here and there
With matter in the margent set, whereon to gase they began
But they ne wist for ought I knew, but hebrew that it were
A Replicacion was the next, which well I understood
For that I found no word therein, but it was English good.
But lo ye here the fourth quod he, that makes up the most
I warrant you a clarkely piece, se how it is be deckte
(As sellers are not now to learn, their wares to praise I guess)
The name thereof Reioynder was, a term to them suspecte
Because it sounded of the law, as though some case it war.
Of ioyncture right for waywarde wives, to pleaden at the bar.
But ay the prynter pressed on, and take them all quod he
I notte your names, but brethren mine. I you assure can
They be as good as in this town in any shop there be
Our names quod be, and one stepped forth, a wight young watre man
Wylkyn is my name, and this is watte, and Herman hight the third
As trusty and sure at tackle knotte, as ever with cord was gyrd.
Well Wilkin, Watte, and Herman gent, by all your names I swear
Ye shall not need upon my word, to stand in any doubt
A meryer jest ye can not find, a board with you to bear
So will ye say your selves I know, when ye have red it out
But if ye be unlearned to read, as maryners lightly be
Then if ye list to hark a while, ye shall it hear of me.
For Gods sweet bones quod Watkyn tho, for bokyshe be we not
We know to half, and stryke, and vyere, and up the anchore way
And cables fold, and clymbe to top, and then go toss the pot
But if thou wylt of curtesy, of this us somewhat say
By god my penny shall be twain, and theyrs shall make a grote
Though we therefore should go to bed, at night with thyrsty throat.
Nay then quod he Saint George to borowe, the day is ours all
Ye shall it hear each line at length, but first and wot ye what
The parties twain between the which, this strife is now befall
It me behooves first to tell, good order asks that
Wherefore a while give ear I pray, till I those twain set out
And then ye may your fansye say, by turn each one about.
This Diker semes a thryuynge ladde, brought up in Pierces scole
The plowman stout, of whom I think ye have full often hard
A swynckyng swain, that handles well his spade and other tool
Full loath he ware for lack of head, they should be reckly marde
For why in them and in his hand, his living chefely stands
He bragges not of his rentes ne fees, ne of entayled lands.
And yet he seems a curtouse hind, and comen of good stock
For Dikers feawe in my country, so well y thewed been
I warraunt you who list him prove, he is no spritelesse block
But to my tale, In cockowe time when each thing began to gren
All weryed from his work, retournes this Daui Diker hende
And for to ease him self the bet, full softely began he wend
Unto his house within a grove, a little there beside
His bottle and his bag, he hent, he left them not behind
Wherein remained but small surplus, of viande at that tide
And down he sat him on the benche, of meat had little mnide
But began complain his werynesse, and on his hand his hedde
He did arrest, and cleped wife, as though he would to bed
Lo dame he said thou wotest I trow, that candle is to diere
To sytte up late and praten out our thryft till farther night
And eke I nyll no supper have, let be put out the fiere
And have we all to bed I say, that rise betymes we might
And in he stepte, and sone he was uncased in his couche
And at his head as was his wont, he laid up his pouche.
To weary laboring men, full sweet does seem such rest
He had not lain long, but loud he began to route
And softly by his side his wife, her self to bed adrest
The dog, the cat, and syb the maid, each couchen them about
Into their hernes where they ware wont, and al was huyst and still
And Dauy began to dream his dream, as we deuysen will
Then Wylkyn began at once vpbrayde, and swear by gods dyne heart
A rushe for books, me lever ware that I could tell this tale
Then of your scrabblynges for to have, a load by wayne or carte
Straw for such peltry, it is good to stuff an empty male
I durst it take upon my soul, in all this lyther thing
Is not a tale that may be found so much to my liking.
Yea yea quod Wat, my self by gisse, in youth might this have learned
If I so wise or happy had been to follow my fathers will
Who would have spent upon my scoole so much as he had earned
But I was bent another way, me thought it very ill
All day to rucken on my tail, and poren on a book
It was nothing unto my pay, full soon I it forsook.
But Herman here our other mate, it was a wytty elfe
Ado, ado, quod herman then and prynter yet go forth
What was the dream that Dauy met as he it told him self
For yet me thinks by thy fare, that dreme is somewhat worth.
Content quod he give hear again, and here me what I said
I shall you read this dream a right, as here I find it plain.
Dauye Dikers dreme.
WHen faith in friends bears fruit, and foolyssh fancies fade
and crafty catchers come to naught and hate great love has made
When fraud flies far from town: and loyterers leave ye fylde
And rude shall run a ryghtfull race, and al men be well wild
When gropers after gain, shall carpe for common wealth
And wyly woorkers shall dysdayne to fygge and live by stealth
When wisdom walks a lofte, and folly syttes full low
And virtue vainquisheth pamperd vice and grace begynnes to grow:
When Justice ioynes to truth, and law lokes not to miede
And brybes help not to buyld fair bowers, nor gifts great gloto^s fiede
When hongre hides his head and pleinty pleases the pore
And nyggardes to the nedy men shall never shut the door
When double dark deceit, is out of credit worn
And fawnyng speech is falshed found and craft is laughed to skorne
When pride that pykes the purse, gapes not for garments gay
Nor Iauelles wear no veluette wiedes nor wandering wits bear sway
When riches wrongs not right, ne power puttes pore abacke
Nor coueytous criepes not into court nor learned lyuinges lack
When slipper sleightes are seen and far fatches be found
And pryuate profit and self love shall both be put in pound
When debt no sergaunt dredes and courtiers credit keep
And might melles not with merchau^dise, nor lords shall sell no shiepe
When lucre lastes not long, and hurde great heaps does hate
And every wight is well content, to walk in his estate
When truth does tread the streets, and liars lurk in den
And Rex does reygne and rule the roast, and wiedes out wicked men
Then balefull barnes be blyth, that here in England won
Your strife shall stynt I undertake, and dreadful days be done.
This Dyker was no fool I guess, quod Watte and Herman tho
It seems well he him bethought, upon the worlds change
And of his drudge and myckle pain, when he to bed did go
And then to dream of such like things, perdy it is not strange
Such as my talk and thoughts have been, the day before certain
Such things again at night in sleep, my dreme has showed me plain.
And eke I harden ones, a right good doctor tell.
That such as farced go to bed, with meat and drink good store
Their dreams always to them in more dysordre fell
Then if they empty went to bed, as ye have hard before
That Dauie did whose supper was, so slender and so short
That nothing else but weariness, and nature caused him snort.
A dream, a straw quod Wylkin then, by god it nas no sweuyn
Men dream of deuyls, of apes, and ^wles, of naked gyrles and boys
But I ne think this dream is such, it hitteth things so even
It talks with good reason round, of fancies ne of joys
But of such things as I can not, amenden with my wit
Nor never shall I think be found, reformed every whytte.
No quod the prynted no, that meant not the dream I undertake
But where as many things ben found, that man's wit can not fatche
To mend as many as we can, and the rest a pattern make
To bring our state as nyghe to them, as man's deuyce can match
As out of Plat^es commen wealth, a tale I could you tell
Of many things that he would have, and not but very well:
That never yet in earth ware found, as he would have them done
Quod Watte no more of Platoes lore, I ken him not by gysse
Ne care not much except he could some rules for change of mean
But well I wot algates and am full sure of this
That I have hard the preachers speak, of as much as is here
And of mo things than any man, is able to come nere.
But ay me thynkes it is to fine, for such a rude vplande
It ware enough for a right good clerk, at instyuynsty taught
He had to help his parysshe pressed, I venture durst my hand
What though he could it dream thus right, yet I believe it naught
That he could with such queint proverbs, his dream at large endite
And eke I think the sely swayne, did never learn to write
No Watte quod the prynter tho, thou harpest on the truth
This Diker had a friend in court that well could handle pen
With whom he was acqueynted erst, as play fellows in youth
Who for they then companions ware did him vouchsafe to ken
And loved Dauy evermore, in him such truth there was
And Dauy when he came to town, unseen would not him pas.
Befell upon a market day, when he this dream had had
That he to London list resort, for things that stood him niede
He found his friend, and all this dream, at length ^^to him radde
And he for that it seemed a thing, the pennynge worth in diede
Began draw it into frame, and shapen as ye hard
And one that lust it fantasien, to pryntynge it prefarde.
Lo now I have the half performed, that I you erst behight
What manner man this Diker was, and how this dream came out
And now I will to Camel pass, if ye therein delight
By whom this ioly stir, is chiefly brought about
And tell fro point to point, as erst I did of this
His worthynesse as I it know, and as the saying is.
The Camel semes to me to be, a great out landishe beast
Quod Herman to the prynter then, that long his peace had hold
With bunches twain upon his back, as high as any horse at least.
Of which I do remenbre is, in the new Testament told
That every rich gnof, may up to heaven as easyly stye
As may this wild unruly beast, pass through a nydles eye.
And eke we none in England have except they been us brought
Of late that I ne know, out of some far country
And by my troth if I shall say you plainly to my thought
Though none we had, it skylles not much, if they so unruly be
But prynter trust thou me, I nylle it not believe
A beast to speak and written this, my reason does not gieue.
The prynter loud he loughe, and so did all the shop
And said that Herman spoken had, as much as might he said
But ware the Camel here quod he, he would be in thy top
No force quod he* of beasts I am nothing afraid
Though I do selde on horseback come, there can no Camel kind
Till I know more, let me to say, tho fancies of my mind.
Mary know thou then quod he, that Camel is a man
Nay prynter soft quod Wylkin the, and suffer me to speak
What cause had he that moved him, to answer to this when
Or why should he of other al, so sumysshlye out break
To dart at Dauye Dikers dream that meant him none unrest
Except he ware one of those sorts, that it would have redrest.
Pardien a dream is but a dream, a fansye of the head
And he ne meant I hope that men, should it for godspell take
But as a sweuyn or fantasy, that each one should it read
For thy me thynkes accordyngly, the name did Dauye make
And now a man (ye say he is) against a dream to spurn
Me think it either smelles of craft, or else of some heart burn.
What soft mate quod the prynter tho, and he began to lowre
You gynue wax hot I wene, against the somer son
Ye may be cooled ere ye come home, with some fresshe Apryl shower
This is to much before that I my tale have all ydonne
Here first an end of all, and then prononcen dome
Or else depart ye calmely hence, even such way as ye come.
Herman was full woe, when he, the printer saw thus wroth
And had but little lust to tarry out the tale
And to his fellows began vpbrayde, ye se the day hence goes
And eke ye know as well as I, the water gynnes to vale
And by the vanes I spy the wind, to be by south at west.
That we us haste to Maldon meade, I think it be the best
And therefore now give us quod he, and take thou here thy grote
And though that Wylkin and this Wat, have showed their hasty wit
(We Maryners be salt yfrette, we can no bet god wot)
I pray the prynter be content and take no grefe at it
We have at home a maryner that can some skyl of book
He shall them see and read them us, and so their leave they ioke.
And I that present was at al, for that I lyked the sport
Began prynt it in my fyckle head, in order as I told
And for to pen it out the bet did to my celle resort
And drew it there into a so^me, as I had hard it told
Not with such words as they it spoke, but in such words as I
Had partly learned of my dame, and list to fantasy.
Such hap may hap, to give a second fytte
If cause shall hap, and laysure serve for it.
Imprynted at London in Fletestrete at the sign of the George next to saint
Dunstones Church by Wyllyam Powell.
