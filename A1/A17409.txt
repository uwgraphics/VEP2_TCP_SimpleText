Christian Reader.
I Shall not need to use many words either of commendation of this small
Treatise, seeing the bare name of him that was the chief Author thereof, I
suppose may be enough to obtain sufficient esteem for it, with those that
have known him, either by his learned writings, or powerful Ministry. Nor of
Apology for my self in aduenturing to cast this little mite into the Lords
Treasury from him that has been able to give such abundance in greater
Volumes, seeing it pleased him to commit unto my care both this and other of
his labors, earnestly desiring that if there were any thing found among his
writings, that might be thought profitable for the public good, I should use
my best endeavor to have it published; I have therefore thought it my duty to
the living if not to the dead, that the end aimed at by him might not be
frustrated: Some of his works have been published since his death, and more
have been long since ready for the Press; which I hope shall ere long come
forth. I know it was the Authors purpose to have made a more complete and
exact Catechism if the Lord had prolonged his life; but he having finished his
allotted task, God took him home to rest from all his labors; howeuer it was
his desire in the mean time to publish these short grounds, for the benefit of
the younger sort, which are very briefly propounded for the help of memory,
and most easy and plain for understanding of the most simple; and yet if we
mark them, we may perceive very much matter comprehended in a few words. It
comes unto thine hands entire for the most part as it was left by him, very
little being added or altered; the whole frame I have cast into a short Table
at the beginning, to the end the learner may first see and learn the whole
method and substance in a few words; as also I have set down the substance
(at least) of those special proofs that confirm these Principles; to the end
thou may save thy labor for searching the places of Scripture quoted, as
also that such as learn the Answers, they may by degrees learn also, and
know the words of the chief proofs; for by this means they may profit more
soundly, when their faith shall be grounded not upon the weak foundation of
humane Authority; but upon the most perfect and sure words of God; learn them
therefore diligently, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.

Farewell: thine in the Lord, W. C.
