A most excellent and famous Ditty of Sampson Judge of Israel, how he wedded
Philistines Daughter, who at length forsook him: also how he slew a Lion, and
propounded a Riddle, and after how he was falsely betrayed by Dalila, and of
his death.
To the tune of the Spanish pauin.
When Sampson was a tall young man
His power and strength increased than
And in the host and Tribe of Dan,
the Lord did bless him still.
It chanced so v^on a day,
As he was walking on his way,
He saw a Maiden fresh and gay
in Ti^nah.
With whom he fell so sore in love,
That he his fancy couldnot move:
His Parents therefore he did prove,
and craved their good wills.
I have found out a wife quoth he,
I pray you Father give her me,
Though she a strangers daughter be,
I pass not.
Then did bespeake his Parents dear,
Have we not many Maidens here,
Of Country, and acquaintance near,
for thee to love and like?
O no, (quoth Sampson presently)
Not one so pleasant in mine eye,
Whom I could find so faithfully
to fancy.
At length they granted their consent:
And so with Sampson forth they went,
To see the Maid was their intent.
which was so fair and bright:
But as they were a going there,
A Lion put them in great fear,
Whom Sompson presently did tear,
in pieces.
When they were come unto the place,
They were agreed in the case:
The wedding day appointed was:
and when the time was come.
As Sampson went for beauties fees,
The Lions carcass there he sees,
Wherein a sort of honny bees
had swarmed.
Then closely Sampson went his way,
And not a word thereof did say,
Until the merry feasting day,
unto the Company.
A Riddle I will show, quoth he,
The meaning if you tell to me
Within seven days, I will give ye
great riches.
But if the meaning you do miss,
And cannot show me what it is,
Then shall you give to me (I wisse)
so much as I have said.
Put forth the Riddle (then quoth they)
And we will tell it by our day,
Or we will lose (as thou do say)
the wager.
Then make (quoth he) the total summer
Out of the eater meat did come,
And from the strong did sweetness run,
declare it if you can.
And when they heard the Riddle told,
Their hearts wichin them waxed cold:
For none of them could then unfold
the meaning.
Then unto Sampsons wife went they
And theatned her with delay,
If she would not the the thing bewray,
to burn her Fathers house.
Then Sampsons wife with grief and woe
Desired him the same to show:
And when she knew she straight did go
to tell them.
Then were they all full glad of this,
To tell the thing they did not miss,
What stronger beast then Lion is?
What sweeter meat? then honny:
The Sampson answered them full round:
If my Hayfar had not ploughed the ground,
So easily you had not found
my Riddle.
Then Sampson did his losses pay,
And to his father went his way,
But wished with them he there did stay,
his wife forsook him quite,
And took another to her Love,
Which Sampsons anger much did move,
To plague them therefore he did prove
his cunning.
A subtle sight he then had found,
To burn their corn upon the ground,
Their Vineyards he destroyed round
which made them fret and fume.
But when they knew that Sampson he
Had done them all this injury,
Because his wife did him deny,
they killed her.
And afterward they had decreed,
To murder Sampson for that deed,
Three thousand men they sent with speed
to bring him bound to them:
But he did break his cords apace,
And with the Iaw-bone of an Ass,
A thousand men ere he did pass,
he killed.
When all his foes were laid in dust,
Then Sampson was full sore athirst,
In God therefore was all his trust,
to help his fainting heart:
For liquor thereabout was none?
The Lord therefore from the Iaw-bone,
Did make fresh water spring alone.
to help him.
Then Sampson had a joyful spright,
And in a City lay that nigh,
Whereas his foes with deadly spite,
did seek his life to spill:
But he at midnight then awakes,
And tearing down the City gates
With him away the same he takes,
most stoutly.
Then on Dalila fair and bright,
Did Sampson set his whole delight,
Whom he did love both day and night,
which wrought his overthrow:
For she with sweet words did entreat,
That for her sake he would repeat,
Wherein his strength, that was so great
consisted.
At length unto his water fall,
And through her suite, which was not (...)
He did not let to show her all,
the secrets of his heart:
If that my hair be cut, (quoth he)
Which now so fair and long you see,
Likes other men then shall I be,
in weckenesse.
Then through deceit which was so deep,
She lulled Sampson fast asleep,
A man she called which she did keep,
to cut off all his hair.
Then did she call his hateful foes,
Ere Sampson from her lap arose,
Who could not the^ withstand their blow,
for weakness.
To bind him fast they did devise,
Then did they put out both his eyes,
In prison woefully he lies,
and there he grinds the Mill.
But God remembered all his pain,
And did restore his strength again,
Although that bound he did remain,
in prison.
The Philistines now were glad of this,
For joy they made a feast (I wisse)
And all their Princes did not miss
to come unto the same:
And being merry been that day,
For Sampson they did send stratghtway
That they might laugh to see him play,
among them.
Then to house was Sampson led
And when he had their fancies fed,
He pluck the house upon their head,
and down they tumbled all:
So that with grief and deadly pain,
Three thousand persons chere was slame,
Thus Sampson then with all his train,
was braiued.
FINIS.

The woeful lamentation of Edward Smith, a poor penitent prisoner in the Iayle
of Bedford, which he wrote a short time before his death.
To the tune of, Dainty come thou to me.
I Am a Prisoner poor,
Oppressed with misery:
O Lord do thou restore,
that faith which wants in me.
In woe I wail and weep,
In griping grief I cry,
In dungeon dark and deep,
In fetters fast I lie
Sighing I sit and moan
My foul offenses all,
My loathsome life is known,
which makes me live in thrall
Ned Smith I am, the wight
In prison that remains,
Tormented day and night,
with bands and iron chains.
My joys are turned to naught,
My hopes are worn away,
My wickedness has wrought
my downe-fall and decay.
Those gifts that God gave me,
My wants for to supply,
Abused much I have.
to please my fantasy.
My name I did deny,
In Baptism given me,
That Sacrament whereby
regenerate I should be.
No wit nor strength may serve
The Law to satisfy:
For death I do deserve,
in right and equity.
For I offended have
Nobles of hie degree,
What favor can I crave
for life or liberty.
But hope of life is past,
My acts so heinous be.
And liberty is lost,
till death do set me free.
All men both old and young
Which are at liberty,
And hear my doleful song.
example take by me.
Be true and trust in God,
Only theft and vice eschew,
Lest Gods most heavy rod,
correct your deeds untrue.
Would I had nere bin borne
To do such wicked deeds,
Which makes me live in scorn
and shame that sore exceeds.
But that which passed is,
I cannot now recall:
My sins and my amiss,
O Lord forgive them all.
Woe worth ill company,
Fie on that filthy crew:
Accursed the day may be
that ever I them knew.
If life and death were set
Before me for to chose,
Though I might pardon get,
my life first would I lose,
Then run that wicked race,
And do as I have done,
Sweet Jesus give me grace,
that life so lewd to shun.
Farewell my loving wife
Who sought to turn my mind,
And make me mend my life,
thy words full true I find,
Farewell my children all,
My tender Babes adue:
Let this your Fathers fall,
be warning good for you.
Dear wife and infants three,
Serve God remember this,
That you true subjects be,
though I have done amiss.
Farewell my music sweet,
And Cittorn silver sound,
Mourning for me is meet
my sins do so abound.
O Lord on bended knees
And hands lift up on hie,
Cast on me gracious eyes
with grace my wants supply
Lay not unto my charge,
The things that I have done,
Though I have run at large.
and played the unthrift son.
Yet now I do repent,
And humbly come to thee
My sins I do lament,
sweet Jesus comfort me.
O Lord I do Lament,
And only joy in thee,
To praise thee day and night,
for thou redeemedst me.
Lord save our royal King
Whose prisoner poor am I,
Prolong his days on earth,
with fame and victory.
Against his Majesty,
I have offended sore,
Committing Felony,
and now I die therefore.
A doleful death God knows,
Which once I did defy:
Thus must I end my woes
which I take patiently,
By thee O Savior sweet,
In heaven I hope to rest,
In joy where I shall meet,
those souls whom thou have blessed
Where we shall sing thy praise,
O God, with voice high,
When I shall end my days,
and live eternally.
FINIS.
