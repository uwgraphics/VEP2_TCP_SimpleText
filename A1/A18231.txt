It palleth also and wastes blodes fresshe
Virtutem prima^ puta esse compescere linguam
Proximus ille deo qui scit racione tacere

Trusts well also the first of virtues all
Is to be stille and keep thy tongue in mewe
Of tongue untied much harm may fall
Leave me well this is as the gospel true

And rest with reason this is verrey text
To god above that man is alder next
Sperne repugnando tibi tu contrarius esse
Conueniet nulli qui secum dissidet ipse

Advise the well that thou never trauerse
Thyn own sentence for there of sueth shame
Sey not oon and efte the contrary reherce
Such repugna^ce wol make thy worship lame
Where steadfastness wol cause thy good fame
For he shall never accord with man on lyve
That with him self will ay repugne and stryve
Si vitam inspicias hoi^m si denique mores
Cum culpas alios nemo sine crimine viuit

If thou advertise and behold about
The lyves of men and manners also
Both of thy self and other the without
In myddelerth thou shall find who

Vtilitas opibus preponi tempore debet

If thou suppose thing that shall noye and grieve
Thaugh they be dear and right great of price
Such as suffers not thy proffit a cheue
If thou lust to be reused as the wise
Absteyne the from such thing in all wise
For it is more wisdam in sothfastnesse
To prefer prouffit than such richesse
Constans et lenis vt res expostulat esto
Temporibus mores sapiens sine crimine mutat

It is a good lesson for the nones
A wight to be tempred with constance
And to be glad and merry eftesones
Not alwey sad ne light of contenance

So the wise man visageth and chereth
Nil temere vxori de seruis creed querenti
Sepe. etem^ mulier que^ co^iunx dilight odit

Gyf no credence alwey to thy wife

With scharper tongue than is swerd or knyf
Playneth on thy servant thaugh noon offenor

Often him that hire housband loves in heart
Cumque mones alique^ nec se velit ipse moneri
Si tibi sit carus noli desistere ceptis

And if thou warn a wight of his forfete
al thaugh he grutcheth with frowning co^tena^ce
And in his langage manace the and threte
Yet forbere thou not for all such displesance
To teache him to amend his governance
As thou began correct that is a mysse
And that is a friendly tache I wysse
Contra verbosos noli contendere verbis
Sermo datur cunctis animi sapiencia paucis

Against woordy folk ay full of wind
Stryve not at al It may not the profit
Such rasshe folks ben in conceits blind
The witles word avails not a myte
In feel words is often wisedam full lite
For unto every wight is given speech
And yet the wise full often ben for to seche
Dilige sic alios vt sit tibi carus amicus
Sic bonus esto bonis ne te mala da^pna sequa^tur

Love other men and have them so in chere
That to thy self thy love most extend
Look no person be to the more dear

That to thy self thou be founden no foo
Rumores fuge ne incipias nouus author haberi
Nam nulli tacuisse nocet nocet esse locutum

Tydinges new that flen as the wind
Eschew my child with all thy diligence
Be never besy new tidinges to find
Such nouelte causes often offense
It is no wit It is no sapience
It hurts not a man to be in pees
But it does harm to put his tongue in prees
Rem tibi promissam certam promittere noli
Rara fides ideo qr multi multa loquntur

Make no promise of other men is hest
Remember well that promise is unsure
But if thou keep thyn thy name sleest
To serve thy behest do thy besy cure
Trust not the word of every creature
Su^me man is feith is esy to break
For many folks thenke not as they speak
Cum te aliquis laudat iudex tuus esse memento
Plus alijs de te qua^ tu tibi credere noli

With words fair when favel fedith the
Be thou not blind for his false flaterye
Late thyn own reason alwey thy Judge be
And in effect if thyn estat be hye
Thaugh favel with his craft will bli^de thin eye
In all thy life thou never give credence
More to thy self than to thy conscience
Officium alterius multis narrare memento
Atque alijs cum tu benefeceris ip^e sileto

When thou see a another man is desert
As for his good deeds commendable
In every place preuy or a part
Such a wight with thy good word enable
And thaugh he have been by the available
Yet of thy good deed make thou no bobaunce
And than shall other men thyn name enhau^ce
Multorum cum facta senex et dicta resensus
Fac tibi succurrant iuuenis que feceris ipse

And if you leave long an old man shall you be
Age wol approach maugre who seith nay
Than perceive behold about and see
How aged folk ben treted with all day
And so pouruey for thy self a say
Into stouping age when thou art crept
Thing may ye help yt in thin youth was kept
Ne cures si quis tacito sermon loquatur
Conscius ipse sibi de se putat omnia dici

Charge not al thaugh you see men speak soft
Ne change no chere for often it is full bet
In secret wise to speak than cry on lofte
A man should see alwey where he were set
And after that so should he speak or let
But to the suspect of harm it seems
Men speak of him he noon other demeth
Cum fueris felix que sunt aduersa caueto
Non eodem cursu respondent vltima primis

When fortune has yeuen the felicite
And set the on high than be war of a fall
Than sueth often such sharp aduersite
Falls fortune tourneth as does a bal
In hire trust have thou no sikernesse at al
Hire perelous play turns whilom to grame
For the end is woo that began that game
Cum dubia et fragilis sit nobis vita tributa
In mortem alterius spem tu tibi ponere noli

Our brotel life is here so full of doubt
That in verrey surete no wight may stand
So suddenly crepen the souls out
Al about this world in every land
Of young and old for every wight is bond
To death therefore set not thyn affiance
In death of him that may ye surviue parchance
Exiguu^ munus cu^ det tibi pauper amicus
Accipito placide plene laudare memento

A litel yefte given with good intent
Of thy friend that leuith in pouerte
With right good chere such yefte take and hent
Supposing ay that as good will has he
And more than many men that richer be
Peyse not the yefte ne pondre not the prise
Thentent is good and that shall the suffice
Infante^ nudum cum te natura creauit
Paupertatis onus pacienter far memento

Since nature that is thy first norice
Has brought the hider al naked and bare
Thaugh thou never can richesse accomplice
But thou art hold alwey in pouertis snare
Yet no force make never to much care
Take patiently pouerte for the best
Riches is not of nature but of earth encrest
Ne timeas illam que vite est vltima finis
Qui mortem metuit quoth viuit perdit idip^m

Thaugh death be the fyn of every creature
And no wight on live shall from him escape
Yet dread not death with over besy cure
To live on earth It is but a Jape
If thou shall alwey after death so gape
Think well to dye but modefye thy thought
Or ellis to live avails the right noght
Si tibi pro meritis nemo respondet amicus
Accusare deu^ noli sed teipse coherce

For thy desert if no friend thank the
I mean when thou have don thy force and pain
To other folks friendly for to be
If they can not gramercy to the said
Withdraw thin hand and so thy self refrain
Blame not thy god / for thaire vnfrendlinesse
But for such men do afterward the less
Ne tibi quid desit quesitis vtere parce
Vt que quod est serves semper tibi deesse putato

Since no richeman that leuith any where
If he consume his goods al and waste
But that pouerte shall grieve sore and dear
Therefore my child such goods as thou haste
Let not to sone out of thy hand beraste
Leest than thy good hereafter wol the fail
Hold that thou have It may the efte avail
Quod prestare potes ne bis promiseris vlli
Ne sis ventosus dum vis bonus esse videri

Behote no man a thing to lene him twice
And fail him oones that is but vilanye
If thou may lene do it in friendly wise
Such cheuissance a friend loath to be wrye
Of thy good deeds clamoure thou not ne cry
Be not wyndy ner of words breme
If a good man thou list appear and seem
Qui simlat verbis nec cord est fidus amicus
Tu quoque fac simile sic ars deluditur art

And if thou find the sone of doubleness
The false dss^milour if thou espy
With peinted words and heart full of falsnesse
Thou may in no wise better blere his ye
Than to serve him with his own treachery
With words fair and friendly to depart
Mean thou the same and art begile by art
Noli hoi^es blando nimiu^ sermon probare
Fistula dulce canit volucrem du^ decipit auceps

Preue you never a man by over peinted speech
For under fair words is often annexed gile
The word is gay but friendship is to seche
As it is said such craft is in this I Will
Yet sum^e think ill when they their to^ges file
The whisteling fouler makes merry song
And so the briddes begileth he among
Cum tibi sint nati nec opes tu^c artibus illos
Instrue quo possint inopem deffendere vitam

When so is that thou have gotten children
Look in her yougth^ than inform hem so
In some craft and mister that they may therein
Learn to get her living and to deffende also
Her life which ever nedeth^ and that they unto
Virtue may atteyne for that he no craft can^
Often time nedeth^ and is in danger of every man
Quod vile est carum quod carum vile putato
Sic tibi nec cupidus nec auarus nosceris vlli

Have this conceit for it is often seen
Thing dear bought full often bate of price
And things that litel of valeu been
In time coming may to great derth arise
Remember well this and it ay advertise
Thus shall you best the name of chincherie fleme
And other men shall the no nygard deem
Que culpure soles ea tu ne feceris ipse
Turpe est doctori cum culpa redarguit ip^m

Advise the well let reason be thy guide
When other folks thou art about to blame
That such default in the be not espied
For if it be than shall thou have the shame
A man's honnour such thing wol reclame
It is full foul when a man wol teache
If that his deeds against his words preche
Quod iustu^ est petito vel quod videatur honestu^
Nam stultu^ est petere quod possit iure negari

Look thy desir be grounded of righ^t
And than that it never trauerse honest
For as often times as any wordly wight
Desires more than right or equite
Than may his request sone replied be
And it is cleped nycete and great folly
To ask often that right wol ay deny
Ignotum tibi tu noli preponere notis
Cognita iudicio constant incongnita casu

Change not a friend that thou know of old
For any new in trust that thou shall find
A better than he but in thy hands thou hold
Him that has been to the friendly and kind
For such eschanges ben often full blind
The semith thou know never a dele
To know a trusty friend It is casuele
Cum dubia in certis versetur vita periculis
Pro lucro tibi pone diem quicu^que laboras

Since that man's life is often full of misery
Whilom in mirth and after in mischief
Now in the valey and now in the hille on hye
Now is man pour and after by riches in relief
The shynyng morrow has often a stormy eve
To this polecie take heed at the last end
Have lucre for thy labor er that thou wend
Vincere cum possis interdum cede sodali
Obsequio quin dulces retinentur amici

Thaugh thou may overcome and have the victory
Of thy friend or fellow yet ay forbere
Refrain thy self and be not haute or hye
Irous hands full evil do grieve and dear
Where easy softness friends may conquer
For by good deeds set in lowliness
Men ben to geder knit in frendlinesse
Ne dubites cu^ magna petas impendere parua
Hijs etem^ rebus coniungit gracia caros

The limitour that visitith the wives
Is wise ynogh of him a man may lere
To give neldes pynnes girdeles and knyues
The craft is good thus does the wise friar
Yeueth thing small for thing that been dear
If thou receyve ever give thou sumwhat a geyn
And that wol ay norisshe love in certain
Litem infer cave cum quo tibi gracia iuncta est
Ira odium generat concordia nutrit amorem

Toil not ne strive with him y^ is thy friend
Be ware of that make never thy friend thy fo
A toylous man may friendship break and shend
Thise baratours that been misreuled so
Interrupte hem self and wrappen in much woe
For wikked wrath engenders but hate
Where as good accord norisshe love algate
Seruorum ob culpam cum te dolor vrget in iram
Ipse tibi moderare tuis vt parcere possis

When thy servant thou take in defaute
Thaugh he can not his necgligence excuse
Yet in thin Ire make not to fers asaute
But with thy male talent take treuse
So shall thou find ease this fet if thou use
Reule thy passion and ay by such mesure
That thou save hem that been under thy cure
Quem superare potes interdum vince ferendo
Maxima etem^ morum semper paciencia virtus

Sufferance does ease was seid long agoo
Suffer thou and have al thin intent
Thaugh al thou may over yet do you not so
Conquer by sufferance and be pacient
But for to follow cruelte never consent
For it is cleped a virtue with excellence
A wight to live in humble patience
Conserua pocius que sunt iam parta labor
Cum labor in dampno crescit mortalis egestas

Be not to skant ner be not to prodigal
Conserve thy things gotten with true labor
It is full fair to be called liberal
But ay eschew wast and be not surfetour
Consume not al thy tresour in oon hour
When of thy labor ryseth noon avail
Needs pouerte must the in have assail
Dapsilis interdum notis caris et amicis
Cum fueris felix semper tibi proximus esto

Be thou not like senola for he would ete
With every man and at his fest him feed
But never no man might taste of his mete
Ner no wight to him come but he to al men yede
Be fre of thy mete but look that larges led
The no ferther than thou may easly ateyne
be ever thin own fre^d thus caton seith certain
Take heed sire and see how holsumly this clerk
Entretith men with virtuous doctrine
The first part of this compendious werk
In worship how they shul full clearly shine
Euydyng to renew straight as a line
Whois preceptis to observe if that ye list
And to his conseil your hertis to enclyne
Right in your age full well It shall be wiste
The virtuous form yt men shul fort convey
Lo in this life as bridel does a best
That man do not err here in this perilous wey*
Stablisshing him as does a steadfast arest
And as siker guydes that men worthiest
Man's leuing here to set in governance
This sage cathon puts in remembrance
Incipit secundus liber
^Elluris si forte velis cognoscere cultus
Virgiliu^ legito quoth si mage nosce laboras
Herbarum vires macer tibi carmine dicet

If thou lust my child set thy hertly delit
Of earth to know the tilthe and the culture
And if thou will be of knowleche parfit
Why sum^e is erable and sum^e eke pasture
Why sum^e is fresh like flowers of picture
I conseile the to study sadly for a while
In the laureat poet great virgile
Si romana cupis et punica noscere bella
Lucanu^ queras qui martis prelia dicit

And thou have desirous fresshe courage
To here of romans noble worthiness
How they veynquisshed them of cartage
And many other through manly prowess
Than read lucan full well can he express
Who bare him best in town and also in feld
And who did meruayles under martes sheld
Si quis amare libet vel discere amare legendo
Nasonem petito sin au^t cura tibi hec est

And who that lust eke of lovers for to read
And in what wise hem self for to auance
As in that craft naso can teache him for to speed
For sum love song. harp. pipe. and dance
Su^me in reding and other thing of pleasance
Su^me louyn covertly eke and lust not be espiede
And sum^e would beknowen thus writes ouide
Vt sapiens viuas audi que discere possis
Per que semotum vicijs deducitur euum

But yet my lef child if that in adventure
Thyn heart be yeuen to noon such manner thing
Or that it be not unto thy plaisure
That virgil macer lucan / or naso does bring
Yet that you may be wise after in thy leuynge
If thou lust to me to give audience
I shall show the doctrine of sapience
Ergo ades que sit sapiencia disce legendo
Therefore my child come nere to me and lere

And I shall the show the verray tresure
Of sapience if the lust to harken and here
And ek how thou shall in good estat endure
And led thy life holy after goddis pleasure
Therefore approach and lere this reding
To b^n a man ay virtuous of leuyng
Si potes ignotis ecia^ prodesse memento
Vtilius est regno meritis adquirere amicos

There is no wight that ferther may report
Of thy good deeds than the stranger may
Make him ay good chere and show him disporte
And he shall with ho^nour utter y^ this no nay
For ye unknown It proffiteth su^time tassay
Friends y now to have It is a better thing
Than is frendles any man to be a king
Mitte arcana dei celum inquirere quid sit
Cum sis mortalis que sunt mortalia cura

Of goddis mystery and ek of his worching
Make never my child to fer inquirance
It is folly any man to muse on such thing
Dispute thou never upon thy gods puruea^ce
For all thing must be under his governance
And since thou art man clad in mortalite
Dispute thou of thing such as mortal be
Linque metum leti nam stultu^ est tpere in euum
Qui mortem metuit amittit gaudia vite

The dread of death that is mordmate
I mean to dread it ay and never to cese
Be ware of that I conscile the algate
For this is true as the gospdl doutlese
Who that dredith death is alwey myrthlese
When dread of death any man so agruggeth
He wastes his time and ay his life abreggeth
Iratus de re incerta contendere noli
Impedit ira animu^ ne possit cernere verum

For thing that is unto the uncertain
When thou art wroth look never that you strive
But first you ought to know ye matter plain
For there is no person oonly on earth a live
But that he onsawl^s is also blyue
As besy wrath has kindled him on fire
And than can he not deem the troth for Ire
Fac sumptu^ propere cu^ res desiderat ipsa
Dandu^ etem^ est aliquid cu^ te^pus postulat a res

As time requires so make ay thyn expense
Mesure thyn hand ek after the profecee
Of thing of time and also of the presence
So that thou spend no more than nedith the
And that spend look that thin heart be fre
A man should do kost and make his spending
Co^sideri^g ye time and ek of his costis rewardi^g
Quod nimiu^ est fugito paruo gaudere memento
Tuta magis puppis modico que flumine fertur

To much is noght of any manner thing
The mean is good and most comendable
That man stands surest here in this leuing
With mean estat that holds him greable
Plente and pouerte to gedre be not suffrable
For than is the ship in the sea most surest
What time the flode is most demurest
Quod pudeat socios prudens celare memento
Ne plures culpant id quod tibi displicet vni

If you know aught yt may turn in to shame
Keep it secret and for no thing it bewrye
Be never to besy such thing to proclaim
Or puplisshe as thou know wol reprye
Make not almen to gauren on it and cry
Lest yt men da^pne ye to other folks unknow
For such falls demers thou may find y now
Nolo putes prauos hoi^es peccata lucrari
Temporibus peccata latent et tpere patent

If thou epsy and see or perceive a forfaiture
And ek a shrewe of misgouernance
Trust well that sumtyme shall come an heure
When for his deeds he shall suffer penance
A cursed deed asks wreche and vengeance
Thaugh wikkednesse for the time be kept secre
Yet at last it wol discovered be
Corporis exigui vires contempnere noli
Consilio pollet cui vim natura negauit

Thaugh sumtyme nature has been unkind
And geuyth a man to be of small stature
Yet remember my child and have in thy mind
That thou never despise that creature
For god may send him fortune and b^ne ure
And often they be with good conseil alied
To whom nature has great strength denied
Quem scieris no^ esse parem tibi tempore cede
Victorem a victo superari sepe videmus

When thy hap is to trauerse and have a do
with him that is noght egal to thy might
Thin vttermest power show not such unto
Lest that eftesones he have the in like plight
For it is often seen in batayl and in fight
Fortune changes often within oon our
And he is scomfited that was erst victour
Aduersus notum noli co^tendere verbis
Lis minimis verbis interdu^ maxima crescit

Of brondes small be made fires great
Withdraw the brondes the fire shall decrese
Agein the hyer look thou not plete
With words feel for words discord thy pese
The man is wise than can of words cese
For this is as verily soth as god gaf life
That words small breden full much stryf
Quod deus intendit noli perquirere sort
Quod statuit de te sine te deliberat ipse

Dele not with magike ner with sorcerie
In gods hand is al fortune and fate
Be not about to calke by destenye
Whether thou be miserous or fortunate
Let god a lone in him is al thyn estate
For what him lust of the to purpose
Withoute^ the he can full well dispose
Inuidiam nimio cultu vitare memento
Que si non ledat tamen hanc sufferre molestum

Beware ay of envy with tatches fell
Withyn thyn heart look ay that she ne rest
For it is oon of the chief peines of hell
When she soiourneth withyn a man is breast
Than brenneth fenix in hire own nest
And than she may noon other man mischeve
Yet ethna cesith not hire self to grieve
Esto forti animo cum sis dampnatus inique
Nemo diu gaudet qui iudice vincit iniquo

Enforce thyn heart with manly sufferance
Thaugh that falls Juggement a geyn the proceed
Be thou not a basshed in word ne contenance
For often times ye falls opp^ssour may reule and led
The law but trust me well withonten dread
Long to rejoice acheve he may not
Which by menes untrue his goodis so gat
Nec te collaudes nec te culpaueris ipse
Hoc faciunt stulti quos gloria vexat i^anis

Thy self also look thou not preise
Ner dispreise but let thou other men alone
Alwey after prudence thy words peise
For thin auant honor shall thou get none
But have a mok as soon as thou art gone
A man to preise him self as seith the scole
Or dispreise much is token of a fool
Litis preterite noli maledicta refer
Post inimicitias iram meminisse malorum est

Wrath of old y^ should be kept out of mind
Be thou not about to make it on live
But the envious has ay a tatche of kind
Such malice my child look you never revive
for such malice of old wrath makes a strive
And who remembers old enemyte
A wikked man forsooth is he
Vtere quesitis modice cu^ sumptus habundat
Labitur exiguo quod partu^ est tempore longo

When it is time of cost and great expense
Bewar of wast and spend ay by mesure
Who that to keep or spend has no differense
Makes his goods may not long endure
For the old proverb says mesure is tresure
Remember that sone thy goods may slip a way
That before were gotten in many a sundry day
Incipiens esto cum tempus postulat aut res
Stulticia^ similare loco prudencia summa est

It is no wisdam a man alwey to be sage
But sumtyme to be nyce and feine folly
Who that has this fet shall find avantage
When time and thing desires that espy
And than dissimise that is great pollecye
For sumtyme to be unwise by appearance
Among the wise is cleped hye prudence
Luxuriam fugito simul et vitare memento
Crimen auaricie nam sunt contraria fame

The filthy flesh meuyng the bestial
That fights ay a gein the soul within
By force of hire attis^ment liberal
Eschew my child and keep the from hire gyn
That art and grace ben set full fer a twyn
And eschew ay of avarice the wikked fame
Thise two they ben that causen evil name
Noli tu queda^ referenti credere semper
Exigua e^ tribue^da fides qr multi multa loqu^tur

Believe you not lightly in every wightis saw
For sum^e reporten thing al other wise*
Than it was ever thought or don or saw
And som^e have it also of custume and of guise
To feed folk with flatering and lies
Therefore give litel trust to such feire speki^g
For many folks speak untrue thing
Quod potu peccas ignoscere tu tibi noli
Nam nullu^ crimen vini sed culpa bibentis

If thou surfete in drink forgete you not that
Advise the well efte thou come not in y^ snare
Withdraw thin hand feed not thy throat to fat
Drink that suffiseth the and ell look you spare
To much drink makes men of wit full bare
And yet the wine thereof is not to blame
To blame is the drinker y^ makith him lame
Consilium archanu^ tacito commit sodali
Corporis auxilium medico commit fideli

To thy trusty friend that is secret to the
Show thy conseil and thy need bewrie
For a trusty friend is the chest of priuite
But it is great hap such friends to espy
Try out oon among al a company
And of thy body betake thou all the cure
Unto such a leche that is trusty and sure
Successus indignos noli tu far moleste
Indulget fortuna malis vt ledere possit

With thy self a grieve the never to sore

That is a sore seen as other thing shall

Where a man prudently can have a fore sight
Rebus in aduersis animu^ submittere noli

For wanhope look thou be not lost ne shent
Let never despair thy wit bereue the
But abide the time that better shall be
Hope is she that shall make the a seth
Hope leueth not a man til man leave the breath
Rem tibi qua^ noscis aptam dimittere noli
Front capillata post hec occasio calua

When men profre than is time to retain
Take ay thing while they ben in season
Many profre now that after wol refreine
For y^ is plente now wol afterward be geson
Therefore take ay in time for so co^seileth reason
For ye balled head was sumtime full of herys
Which is now bare without rasure or sherys
Quod sequitur specta quoth i^minet ante videto
Illum imitare deu^ qui parte^ spectat vtramque

Provide thy self and have deliberance

Fortune feture and pouste and all that is p^sent
Forcior vt valeas interdum parcior esto
Pauca voluptati debentur plura saluti

It is a tatche of a deuouryng hand
To receive superfluyte and do eke excess

Content thy nature and fle ay from gredinesse

If that in health the lust thy life to have
Sic tibi precipue quoth primu^ est cura salutis
Tempora ne culpes cum sint tibi causa doloris

Sompnia ne cures nam men's humana quoth optat
Dum vigilat sperat per sompnum cernit id ip^m

Dread thou no dremes so seith deutronomye
For often they be caused of diverse complexion
Som^e of ymaginaco^ns and many a nice fa^tasie
Or ellis of blood or of superflue replexion

When they be wakyng they desire and think
Upon that thing they dreme when they wink
Iudiciu^ populi nu^qua^ co^tempseris vnus
Ne nulli placeas du^ vis co^tempnere multos

When that a multitude has give a decree

As to thy self here after shall be lef and dear
Instrue preceptis ai^m ne discere cesses
Nam sine doctrina vita est quasi mortis ymago

Man's soul resembles a new plain table
In which yet apperith to sight no picture
The philisophre says withouten fable
Right so is manes soul but a dedly figure
Unto the time she be reclaimed with ye lure
Of doctrine and so get her a good habit
To be expert in cu^nyng science and proffit
Interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis
Vt possis ai^mo que^uis sufferre laborem

Who that lakketh rest may no while endure

But that whilom thou may also resort

Cum recte viuas ne cures verba malorum
Arbitrij nostri no^ est quoth quisque loquatur

If thou live justly ay keep up right
Never declinyng for mede lucre dread or favor
Treuly than sta^dest thou in a fulholsome plight
Though men malign ye with words of rigor
If thou live thus thy good life is thy tour
We may not let the people to gaure and cry
But do yet well thaugh they missey or lie
Productus testis saluo tamen ante pudore
Quantu^cumque potes celato crimen amici

Sone if thou be called the soth to testifye
Evermore saving thy worship and honest
Thy friends trespass be not about to bewrye
Where as no shame thereof may grow to the
This requires ay good friendship parde
In well and the true benevolence
Betwix folks is friendship in assistence
Sermones blandos blesosque cauere memento
Simplicitas viri fan^a est fraus ficta loquendi

Behold wisely about and spy thy covert train
When that falls fauel knokketh at thy yate

With the oil of plaisance in full great foison
But yet under ye keep ye well from this poison
Segniciem fugito que vite ignauia fertur
Nam cu^ ai^mus languet co^sumit inercia corpus

Slouthe slogardy and dull Idelnesse
And lachesse that causes to be negligent
Enforce ye ay to eschew with all thy besinesse
For Idel soul makes thy body shent
Treuly there is in earth no gretter argument
For to conclude thy mortal body unapt
Than the soul in Idelnes to be wrapte
Comoda multa feras sin aute^ spreueris illud
Non me scriptorem sz te neglexeris ipse

Enprinte my teching in thy soul steadfast
And full proffitable thou shall it find
Forsake it not ner fro thin heart it cast
For if that thou exclude out of thy mind
This lesson thou art full barein and blind
From virtues and therefore wite not me
Sithen the default my sone is than in the
Alterius dictu^ aut factu^ ne carpseris vnqua^
Wedde not a wife for hire enheritance

For she wol cast it often in thy berd
And if she be noyant and full of greuance
Constreine hire never to abide in thy yerd
Of chastisement It is a cursed swerd
To keep such oon that wol ay a twyte
For he is at ease that of such oon is quyte
Multorum disce exemplo que facta sequaris
Que fugias vita nobis est aliena magistra

Of other men thou shall thy myrrour make
Co^fourme the to that / that most men appreue
What thou shall do and what thou shall forsake
A better fet may thou not contreue
Than to other men is deeds releue
In all that pertains to thy techyng
Make of other men a reule of thy leuyng
Quod potes id tempta operis ne pondere pressus
Succumbat labor et frustra temptata relinquas

Atte^pte no thing that surmonteth thy might
Ner that to finisshe thou may not acheue
For than stand thou foul in thin own sight
Over his pouer what man that lusts meue
With shame his work must needs take leave
It is folly a man such works to begin
Which to perform his power is to thynne
Quod nosci factum non recte noli silere
Ne videare malos imitari velle tacendo

Law presumes that what man kepith stille
The crime of oon that has done great offense
And discouerid hit not he is than jlle
As the criminous for keeping of his scilence
Therefore my sone being it in to audience
That thou perceiuest not well don is
Lest for silence men deem of the a mys
Iudicis auxilium sub iniqua lege rogato
Ipse etem^ leges cupiu^t vt jure regantur

When the law is strait and rigorous
Entrete ay the Judge to do the favor
Enclinyng him for to be gracious
For an egal Judge may thy cause ay socour
And yet the law shall be his governor
Which owes sumtyme to modefie
As in cas he may a point aspie
Quod merito pateris pacienter far memento
Cumque reus tibi sis ip^m te iudice dampna

What peine thou suffrest for thy desert
Receive it ay well in gree and patience
Al thaugh thy trespass be pryue and covert
Yet when thou weyes it in thyn aduertence
That thou art blemisshed in thy conscience
With in thy self make thou an arbitrament
Demyng thy self in thyn own Iuggement
Multa legas facito perlectis perlege multa
Nam miranda canu^t sed no^ credenda poet

Mispende thou no time never for lachesse
But whilom read in books old and wise
Read and report eke with great attentifnesse
By reding to cu^ nyng a man may rise
Than read my sone and cu^ nyng accomplise
These poets written thing of great marvel
And eke of small credence often this is no fail
Inter conuiuas fac sis sermon modestus
Ne dicare loquax dum vis vrbanus haberi

Evermore among friends sitting at fest
Be thou curteys and demeure of thy langage
Who y^ speaks most is not counted wisest
For of flesh and bone nature has made a cage
The tongue to keep that she be not outrage
Than if thou will be preferred of nature
Refrain thy tongue with all thy besy cure
Coniugis irate noli tu verba timere
Nam lacrimis struit insidias du^ femina plorat

So^me wo^men wepen of pure feminite
When other wise they can not thaire intent
Acheue but yet be war of such nyce pite
Thy manly reason for that be not blent
For such weping thy heart aught never relent

And under that they can both pryk and stynge
Vtere quesitis sed ne videaris abuti
Qui sua co^sumu^t cum deest aliena sequntur

When thou have gotten to thy worship use
What avails richesse with out honor

Is no point of proffit ner of socour
Therefore that you have gotten with true labor
Consume not in mysuse lest thou do a mys
Often he nedith of other y^ wasted has his
Fac tibi propenis mortem no^ esse timendam
Que bona si no^ est finis tamen illa bonorum

Enprinte my child ay hertly in thy mind
That thou be not of death so sore a drad
Exemplo simili ne te derideat alter

It is full hard to please every wight
Displease the of no manner deeds ner them lak
Ner thaire words neither for even so right
As thou displeased them behind thy bak
Right so wol men make the a mok and knak
For the contrary thaugh men had it sworn
The scorner shall be guerdoned ay with scorn
Quod tibi sors dederit tabulis supprema notato
Augendo serua ne sis quem fama sequatur

When thy last sort that men callen fate
Is good and pleasant after thyn intent
This mean I lo when thou art fortunate
Record al thy goods that god has the sent
And suffer hem not reklesly to be spent
For than of a wastour thou shall have ye name
For great riot wol cause thy feeble fame
Cum tibi diuicie superant in fine senecte
Munificus facito viuas no^ parcus amicis

Into great age what time that thou art crept
And have richesse prosperity and great habundance
Be liberal than of y^ goods y^ a fore y^ have kept
Thenke well thou have ynogh and suffisance
Let never thy good of the have governance
But govern and depart it ay with thy friend
For wha^ you ghost hens it may not with y^ wend
Vtile consiliu^ dominus ne despice serui
Nullius sensum si prodest co^tempseris vnquam

The pour folks also som^e time be full wise
A servant su^tyme may be ek of great sapience
Thaugh al he be had in litel reverence
Re^arde his wit if it be worth the while
For virtue is hid under many an habit vile
Rebus et in sensu si no^ est quod fuit ante
Fac viuas co^tentus eo quoth tempora prebent

This worlds wealth ebbing and flowing ay
At no certain is like as wankle aprile
Thaugh thou have loss you shall not y^ dismay
Be content with that you have for the while
So^me man there is y^ has neither cross ne pile
Now in his ward and yet right good adventure
Is him full negh no man may know his ure
Vxorem fuge ne ducas sub noi^e dotis
Nec retinere velis si cepit esse molesta

Which shall the from wrechednesse unbind
Where in thy life so long thou have forth lad
A life perauenture to god and man full bad
The which thaugh she be not to al proffitable
Yet she makes an end both of bad and able
Vxoris linguam si frugi est far memento
Namque malum nil velle pati nec posse taceri

Thy wyves words thou suffer and take in gre
When it avails for betyde it may
Full often that of great prudence is she
And most to be allowed this is no nay
Suffer hire than and hire conceit assay
For it is hard when thou can not be stille
Ner yet to suffer hire thou can eke have will
Dilige no^ egra caros pietate parents
Nec matrem offendas dum vis bonus esse parenti

Goods that been yeuen the of nature
They come to the of thy progenitors
Therefore my child with all thy force and cure
Look thou love hem and cherisshe at al hours
For they fostred y^ and kept in youth from shours
Thy mother my dear child yet in especial
If thou do well never offend at al
Resort resort and hiderward the releue
My maistre now here is an wholesome eire
For your avail to this place retreue
Where as for moralite spri^ging flowers feire
And sote full pleasantly do the repeire
Gadre of hem and make a chaplet or a gay
And rest you a while here right in this herbere
Behold well and see what thing is to your pay
Incipit liber quartus
^Ecuram quicu^que cupis deducere vitam
Nec vicijs herere ai^m que moribus obsunt

What wight that lust to live in sekernesse
His life and his soul to keep from incu^brance
Of vices the which and good thewes express
Be ay at stryf come nere and give attendance
Thise preceptis keep well in remembrance
Enrolling hem and printing in your mind
And so to live the menes shall ye find
Despice diuicias si vis ai^o esse beatus
Quas qui suscipiunt me^dicant semper auari

The foul talent of riches my child eschew
And resemble thou never gredy tantalus
Whose etyk in hunger is alwey new
Among the feire apples delicious
No water sweet que^chith his thrust right thus
To vilayns swalowe of couetise
Loo all this world noght can ner suffice
Comoda nature nullo tibi tempore deerunt
Si contentus eo fueris quoth postulat vsus

With reasonable fedyng be thou content
As in diete a man should never over charge
Him self for with surfeit many men ben shent
For thaire receites ben to great and large
Men seen alday that litel bote or barge
Wol drenche a noon when it is over freight
Cherisshe ever nature with none over weight
Cum sis incautus nec rem racione gubernas
Noli fortuna^ que non est dicere cecam

If thy thing the hap to misgouerne
Without reason or any providence
Than mine own child of me this lesson learn
Say not It was by fortune such expense
To make but wite it thyn own negligence
For fortune may never compelle the
Thy good to spend but at thy liberte
Dilige denariu^ sed parce dilige formam
Qua^ nemo sanctus nec honestus captat habere

Love thou the penny as for thy cheuisance
Not for the quoyne to horde it upon hepe
For of the prince was made the ordonance
Not for in cofres It should be stille and sleep
But y^ it should ay stere among ye people and sepe
In their eschange and who that kepith it Inn
As for the form is ay soubget to sin
Cu^ fueris locuples ocrpus curare memento
Eger dives habet nu^mos sz no^ habet ipsum

When thou have plente and art pecunial
I mean when thou have great suffisance
Of money foyson and help but small
Than spend thy money and thy self auance
Keep never the coin and live in greuance
The sike has silver in full great excess
But of him self he has no sikernesse
Verba cu^ tuleris discens aliqua^do magistri
Fer patris imperiu^ cu^ verbis exit in iram

Thaugh sumtime you suffer the great shrapnes
Of beting yet ay thy maistres chastisement
Take well in gre with humble lowlines
Since it is don but al in good intent
In cause to learn and wisedam for to hent
Al thaught his words sown full of Ire
Yet suffer thou the talent of that fire
Res age que prosunt rursus vitare memento
In quibus error inest nec spes est certa laboris

Also my child thou shall the ay occupy
To wirke thing that been proffitable
But look thou never thy wits apply
To things that may not be available
To keep a thing that is not proffitable
By wit or strength It is great error
Dispaired hope is the end of such labor
Quod donare potes gratis concede roganti
Nam recte fecisse bonis in part lucrosum est

When you shall give than give in friendly wise
Friendly content thou a prayer or a request
For thing yeuen by time is yeuen twice
Such gladsome chere makith yeftes richest
Who that yeueth gladly and sone yeueth is best
Loo no thing better may thing conquer
Than a man to lene that he may forbere
Quod tibi suspectu^ est co^festim discute quid sit
Namque solent primo que su^t neglecta nocere

When upon a thing thou have a conjecture
As in thy conceit holding in suspect
To discoure that a noon do thy cure
For at the first when such thing is reject
That should sewe after is easy to correct
A thing that at the firfr is noght set by
Is often times seen to grieve finally
Cum te detineat veneris dampnosa voluptas
Indulgere gule noli que ventris amica est

And when thou art disposed inwardlye
To venus acts than oppress thy courage
Suffer not thy flesh than to lustlye
For great diete makes thy flesh outrage
Where as mesure might causen it to aswage
And gloteny is cleped the chief prometrice
Leding the flesh ay to wantonness and vice
Cum tibi proponas ai^alia cuncta timere
Vnu^ precipue hoi^em plus esse timendum

The rampant lion and the tigre fell
The jrous bore the hou^de full of envy
And many moo bestis tha^ here nedith to tell
Men dreden full sore and eke thaire tirannye
And well they do but yet oon be espy
That is a fore al other most especial
Man is the beast that thou most dread shall
Cum tibi preualide fuerint in corpe vires
Fac sapias ai^o sic tu poteris vir fortis haberi

The virtue that is called fortitude
Stondeth al in the strength bodily
As to be eurous mighty strong and rude
But in the soul It must be sikerly
Nevertheless if thou will thy soul fortefye
And him within a queinte with sapience
Treuly than shall thou be strong in existence
Auxilium a notis petito si forte laboras
Nec quisqua^ melior medicus qua^ fidus amicus

What thing in earth that you shall take on hand
And thy support shall be in frendlinesse
No strange wight on live so negh ye wol stand
As thy known friend my child this is express
Of the stranger have thou no sikernesse
For when al other ben for to seche
The feithful known friend can best be thy leche
Cum sis ipse nocens moritur cur victima pro te
Stulticia est in morte^ alterius sperare salutem

The death of bestes that been unreasonable
As by custume and right of sacrifise
To pourge the js no seth greable
Trust not also to get thy repryse
For they that trusten so ben full unwise
By death of bestes god wol not quemed be
And a man a bide stille in his iniquyte
Cum tibi vel sociu^ vel fidum queris amicum
Non tibi fortuna est hoi^s sz vita petenda

When thou would chese a friend for trustiness
Of his fortune make noon inquirance
For fortune is mother of changeableness
But ask of his deeds and his governance
For that is proved of gretter suffisance
Than ure of fortune that is casuelle
For life of man his fortune does excess
Vtere quesitis opibus fuge nomen auari
Quid tibi diuicie prosunt si pauper habundas

Use well the richesse that thou have of quest
Of avarice the wikked fame eschew
Let not thy good lie ay stopped in thy chest
Keep not thy tresour and stuf ay closed in mewe
Such old tresour wol make thy shame new
What proffiteth plente and great tresure
And in pouerte a wreche al wey to endure
Si famam seruare cupis du^ viuis honestam
^ac fugias ai^o que sunt mala gaudia vite

My sone if thou desire to rejoice thy fame
In honest while thou lyuest here
Eschew thing that may causen thy shame
And lichorous lusts must be leyde on lere
And eke thingis feel that full Ioious appear
Thy worlds Joy is often full defectif
Be war of Joy that lettith thy good life
Cum sapias ai^o noli irridere senectam
Nam quocu^que seen puerilis sensus in illo est

And ay my child assay and advertise
That thou never skorne the great stouping age
Thy elder my sone for no thing thou despise
Thaugh al in thaire wits they be not so sage
As in thaire youth since age is outrage
When age comes this is soth certain
A man begins than to be a child a gain
Disce aliquid nam cu^ subito fortuna recedit
Ars remanet vitamque hoi^s no^ deserit vnquam

Enforce thy wits sumwhat for to lere
Aqueinte the with cu^nyng for it is sure
If fortune change and pouerte appear
Who that is cu^nyng is likly to recure
Cu^nyng and craft remain ever and endure
And by them a man may sone releue
When fortune has cast him to mischeve
Prospicito cuncta tacitus quod quisque loquatur
Sermo hoi^m mores celat et iudicat idem

Be stille in scilence with good aduis^dnesse
Tarry my child til other have said
So shall you learn sumwhat of steadfastness
Let never thy tongue sodeinly be vnteide
For that might the of hastiness abreide
By man is word his manner wol be shewde
By word eke is known ye wise from ye lewd
Excerce studiu^ qua^uis perceperis artem
Vt cura ingeniu^ sic et mamis adiuuat vsum

Thaugh of cu^nyng thou have full great
Enforce the ay my child yet to learn more
The soul it is that must be thy receipt
Replenisshe here with virtues tresour and store
Use makes maistrie use you ay cunning therefore
Use helps art and cure helpith wit
Than use and cure to gedre must be knit
Multum venturi ne cures tempora fati
Non metuit mortem qui scit conte^pnere vitam

The body from the soul shall have disseuerance
Death is the end common of every wight
Charge not therefore of death is chance
The tribut of death must thou pay of right
But yet of death shall thou set but light
If by this life thou set right noght express
The which is ay full of woe and wrechednesse
Disce sed a doctis indoctos ip^e doceto
Propaganda est etem^ rerum doctrina bonarum

Learn ay of the wise and teache the vncu^nyng
For it is virtue and at al time commendable
To encrese doctrine through such co^menyng
It is eke alwey a deed of god charitable
Both to learn and to teache It is full greable
Doctrine helpith virtue evermore on live
Which ne were doct^ne sone from us would slyue
Hoc bibe quoth possis si tu vis viuere sanus
Morbi causa mali namque est quecumque voluptas

Drink not to much more than thou may lere
Reule well ay thy self with y^ bridel of mesure
To much drink wol thy body noy and dear
For surfeit is evermore of health unsure
And mesure makes men in health tendure
What man is reuled after lusts vile
In good estat he may abide no while
Laudaris quodcu^que palam quodcu^que probaris
Hoc vide ne rursus leuitatis crimine dampnes

And if it hap the my child in audience
A thing to praise bewar that thou not blame
Efte a gein right the same in presence
If thou dispreise commend not eke the same
Of such trauers must nedis rise shame
To preise now and este to blame expres
It is a sign of great unsteadfastness
Tranquillis rebus que su^t aduersa caueto
Rursus in aduersis melius sperare memento

When you lyuest here right at thin own ease
In all thy hertis joy rest and prosperity
Thenke yet parcas that prosperity may sese
For wordly wealth stands never in sikerte
And as sone when pouerte or aduersite
Assauteth y^ yet fall thou never in despair
Thenke ay in thy self good fortune may repair
Discere no^ cesses cura sapiencia crescit
Rara datur longo prudencia temporis vsu

It is full fair m^ ^hild to be prudent
And wise look that thou learn fast therefore
To learn ay my sone do thyn intent
For by cure and besinesse wisdam is the more
Wisdam is she that may not be forbore
The rare prudence that folks nyce refuse
Can never be had but by process and use
Paror laudato nam que^ tu sepe probaris
Vna dies qualis fuerit monstrabit amicus

Beware also that thou never enhance
In thy laud or preising a wight to hye
For thou may have cause efte to disanance
Thy fame but ay thy preising modefye
For on a day thou shall full well espy
Whether he be friend that friendly semyth
For all be no friends that men demyth
Ne pudeat que nescieris te velle doceri
Scire aliquid laus est culpa est nil discere velle

Be not a shamed also my child to lere
That thou can not for it is but a tecche
Of folly noght to desire doctrine to here
For well is him that to cu^nyng may strecche
For cu^nyngles a man is but a wreche
Therefore to cu^ne much it is right come^dable
And eke noght to cu^ne it is most rep^uable
Cum venere et bacho lis est et iuncta voluptas
Quod iustu^ est ai^o complectere sz fuge lites

Vemis is ay ready to al hire acts vile
When that bachus has hire in largess
Through the tresour of hire h^te and fervent sire
Therefore my child thin apetit thou repress
In wynes hete do thou never to great excess
Drink no more than for the soul is expedient
Eschew strif and ay with mesure be content
Dimissos ai^o tacitos vitare memento
Quo flumen est placidu^ forsan latet alcior vnda

The solein stille man often meneth fraud and gile
Of such a man eschew ay the company
For the stille man compasses other while
Within his deceit falshede and treachery
In flodes stille is water deep and hye
For often times betide unhappy chance
In stremes soft semyng to thy pleasance
Cum tua fortuna rerum tibi displicet vni
Alterius specta quo sis discrimine peior

With thy fortune when thou art discontent
And can not take in gre thin adventure
Behold about and feel in thin aduisement
How they y^ whilom were of goods more sure
Than thou and more likly in wealth tendure
Both for bou^te favor and eke noblesse
and yet suddenly they have fall into wrechednesse
Quod potes id tempta nam litus carpere remis
Tucius est multo qua^ velum tendere in altum

Attempt the thing so as thou may suffice
Pass never thy might bear never to hye a saylle
For there is perel if that the streme a rise
Certain my child this is without fail
The vessel small is at full great avail
When that with core to land he may a reche
When the sails hye full often gone to wreche
Contra hoi^em iustum praue contendere noli
Semper em^ deus iniustas vlciscitur iras

a gein the true just man braule you never ne strive
For unto god a boue that is great displeasance
Trust this trewly there is noman here on live
That to the just man does dear or greuance
But at the last god wol take vengance
Therefore hereof it is reason jche man to take
For ye right wiseman of god is never forsake
Ereptis opibus noli merere dolendo
Sed gaude pocius si te contingat habere

If extorcion or of any misauenture
Have plukked at the and made the thredbare
Of richesse yet do thou ay thy force and cure
To be merry and eschew thought and care
For flitering thought is a foul snare
Come not therein fortune is unstable
After pouerte richesse ^s preignable
Est iactura grauis que su^t amittere dampnis
Su^t quedam que far decet pacienter amicu^

It is harm thy goods to for go
That been in hand with force and violence
But yet my child thou must considere who
And what he is that does such offense
Between friend and foo have ay a difference
For in su^me cas thou aught a friend forbere
And eke suffer him though he noye and dear
Tempora longa tibi noli promittere vite
Quocu^que ingrederis sequitur mors corperis vmbra^

Be not sure that thou shall live here long
A wight shall dye al be it that he be loath or lef
And as the old so does the young eke among
Death stelith ay on as does a pryue thef
For a gein death men may find no relef
She is about ay to make a final divorce
And foleweth each day the schadowe of thy corse
Thure deu^ placa vitulum sieve crescat aratro
Net credas placare deu^ dum cede litatur

Worshipe god with all thy puissance
With heart entier and sweet smelling ensence
Such sacrifice is good to his pleasance
Of the calves small that never did offense
Thaugh thou hem sle the blood may not dispense
With ye let hem grow and swynke in the plough
Thy true heart ay to god is suffisa^ce is ynogh
Cede locum lesus fortune cede potenti
Ledere qui potuit aliqua^do prodesse valebit

Give place to him that excedith thy might
Thaugh thou be hurt It may proffite par chance
And selde avails any man to fight
Agein such oon that passith his puissance
Thaugh al it grieve now efte it may avance
For often is seen that after great duresse
The mighty man is full of gentillesse
Cum quid peccaris castiga teipse subinde
Vulnera du^ sanas dolor est medicina doloris

After thy surfeit and thy great offense
Chastise thy self correct that is a mys
Redress ye to good reule amend thy negligence
And sorrow for sin a verrey medicine is
Repent the sore than art thou sauf I wys
For phis^k seith my sone I the ensure
A bitter drink the sharp seknesse may cure
Dampnaris nu^qua^ post longu^ tempus amicu^
Mutauit mores sz pu^gnera prima memento

If you have found good friendship in a wight
Long a goo and yet thaugh he begin to change
Dispeire him not men abide not i^ oon plight
For su^time was lordship there now is gra^ge
The worlds course is wondre queint and strange
But thaugh as now the man is wex unkind
Yet is old friendship remembrd ay in mind
Gracior officijs quo s^s mage carior esto
Ne nomen subeas quod dicitur officiperdi

Thaugh it ure the in office to be set
Than be thou gentil and gracious to other men
That they may report a godly is met
With office and so good name shall ren
About of the but assure the lest when
The officer is unbound than seith the prees
Now would to god ye this man were officeles
Suspectus caueas ne sis miser omnibus horis
Nam timidis et suspectis aptissima mors est

Be not suspect that is a wikked teache
The suspect man with coward ferfulnesse
In his living is but a verrey wreche
Mys is a mys but al he would redress
He demeth falls and fails hertlinesse
By falls conceit set in malencolye
Sleth him a noon thus death endith his folly
Cum seruos fueris proprios mercatus in vsus
Et famulos dicas hoi^es tamen esse memento

If thou have men without fredom and liberte
Such as ben cleped men of bondage
Notwithstanding they be under thy captivity
Yet honor such and over hem be not to outrage
If they beholden under thy wordly seruage
For all they ben bound yet verrey men they be
that god has made them me^ yet ay remember ye
Qua^ primu^ rapienda tibi est occasio prima
Ne rursus queras que iam neglexeris ante

Thy first fortune receive with readiness
Refuse it not thaugh it be skant and small
It is well better in gre to take the less
Than to refuse it and after fail of al
Yeftis of fortune take hem ay as they fall
Refuse hem now and efte thou shall have need
Therefore it is to take when me profre and bid
Morte repentina noli gaudere malorum
Felices obiunt quorum sine crimine vita

Rejoice the never my child in all thy life
The sodein death of a cursed man and wreche
When he is ded the soul may not relef
From peine to joy the soul may not reche
The fendes hold ay sore that they may keche
Therefore who y^ liuyth justly full well does he
For his soul is ay full of felicite
Cum co^iunx tibi sit nec res et fama laborat
Vitandu^ ducas inimicum nomen amici

If thou have a wife in assurance
Trust hire well and love her inwardlye
With heart with thought with all thy affiance
And be thou never infect with suspect Ielosye
If no fault be in hire or that thou can espy
Yet if thy friend tell the such is the fame
He is a friend and she no thing to blame
Cum tibi contigerit studio cognoscere multa
Hac discas multa vita nescire doceri

When through study and great excersice
Thou know much and have great cu^nyng
Yet ay do thy diligence in the most besy wise
To purchase more for it is a wholesome thing
For to great honnour cu^nyng may the being
And eschew thou never daily to be taught
for without teching cu^nyng may not be caught
Miraris verbis midis me scribere versus
Hec breuitas sensus fecit co^iungere binos

If thou aught marvel or lust to muse
In naked words why my versis thus I write
In no wise trewly I may me better excuse
Than sey my wit so dull is and vnparfite
Which arteth me thus rudely for to endite
By two and two my meter for to knyt
No thing causes me but simpleness of wit
Now I have gadered flowers to your list
Tastes them for they be preseruatyf
Holds them fast and bear hem in your fyst
For the pestilence eire which is infectif
I conseile you and I jeparde my life
That ye shul led your life in sekernesse
And eke ateine to much worthiness
This mean I to you under protection
Of your good grace what time ye read
Or ell have in this matter inspection
As it bids that ye wol do in deed
Than dar I afferme without dread
Ye shul acheue and be full virtuous
Here have I fond that shall you guide and led
Straight to good fame and leave you in her house
