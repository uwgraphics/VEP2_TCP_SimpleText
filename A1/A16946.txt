The New Broom.


Poor Coridon, did sometime sit
hard by the Broom alone:
And secretly complained to it,
against his only one.
He bids the Broom that bloomes him by
bear witness to his wrong,
And thinking that none else was nie,
he thus began his Song:
The bonny Broom, the well favored Broom,
the Broom bloomes fair on hill,
What ailed my Love to lightly me,
and I working her will?
If Syrinx for despising Pan
the Shepherds god, was changed,
Into a Reed, may I not then,
hope well to be revenged
On Galatea? whose disdain
for sorrow does consume
Poor Coridon, who still complains,
and mournes among the Broom,
The bonny Broom, etc.
If proud Apollo fell in love
with that Penean dame,
And left his blessed abode above,
to feed his fleshly flame,
For pride syne turned in a Tree,
that Death should be her Doom:
Shall she not sometime sigh for me,
and mourn amongst the Broom?
The bonny Broom, etc.
For she has seen my sighs and tears,
and knows my kind intent:
Yet scorns for to regard my cares,
and laughes when I lament.
Yet though a look would send relief,
to ease my grieved groan:


First would she then to end my grief,
be buried in the Broom,
The bonny Broom, etc.
Oh, would she leave her coy disdaines,
which makes me dwine and die.
And pity him who still complains,
that she so coye should be.
Poor Coridon would out of doubt,
his wonted joys resume:
And sing her praises round about
the borders of the Broom.
The bonny Broom, etc.
But since she still continues coye,
and careless of my care:
I will awake the blinded Boy,
my suit for to declare:
That he over whom my Mistress proud
so proudly does presume:
And make her sigh and sing aloud,
sad songs about the Broom:
The bonny Broom, etc.
Else proud Apollo I thee pray,
to turn her in a Tree:
Pan throw thy pleasant Pipe away,
Make her thy Reed to he,
In tree or Reed when she is changed.
let none of these bear bloome:
So will I hold me well revenged,
and blithly sing the Broom
Bear witness Broom, thou dainty Broom
that bloomes on hill and dale:
Since Galetea lightlies me,
I take my long Farewell.
FINIS.
