The excusation of the prentar.
INgyne of man be inclinatioun
In sindry wise is geuin, as we se.
Sum men ar geuin to detractioun,
Inuy, displeseir, or malancolie,
And to their nychbouris hes no cherite.
Sum ar so nobill and full of gentilnes,
They luf no thing bot Joy and merynes.
Sum ar at under, and sum maid up of nocht.
Sum men luffis peace, and sum desitis weir.
Sum is so blyth in to his merry thocht,
He curis nocht, so he may perseueir
In grace and favor of his lady deir.
Sum boldin at other in may cruel feid
With lance and dagar rynnis to the deid.
Ane hes that mycht ane hundredth weil sustene,
And leiffis in woe and penance at his table.
And of good fallois comptis nocht ane been.
His wrechit mind is so insaciable.
As heuin and hell were no thing bot ane fable
He bir^is ay, but sycht to good or evil.
And rynnis with all his baggis to the devil.
And I the prentar that dois considir weil

And in this wark that I have heir assaileit
To bring to lycht, may humely I exhort

In letter, sillabe, poyntis lang, or schort.

And tak the sentence the best wise e may,

QUhen siluir Diane full of bemis brycht
fra dirk eclips was past yis other nycht
And in ye crab her propir mansion gane.
Artophilax contending at his mycht
In the great eist to set his visage rycht.
I mean the ledar of the charle wane
Above our heid was the vrsis twane.
Quhen sterris small obscuris in our sycht,
And Lucifer left twinkland him allane.
The frosty nycht with her prolixit houris
Her mantill quhit spread on the tender flouris.
Quhen ardent lauboure hes addressit me
Translait the story of our progenitouris.
Their great manheid hie wisdom and honouris.
Quhen we may cleir (as in ane mirroure) se
The furius end sum time of tirannye.
Sum time the glore of prudent gouernouris
Ilk stait apprisit in their faculte.
My weary spreit desyring to repres
My emptiue pen of frutles besynes
Awalkit forth to tak the recent air.
Quhen Priapus with stormy weid oppres
Raqu^istit m^ in his may tenderness

Bot I no manner couth my mind prepare
To set aside vnplesand heaviness,
On this and that comtemplyng solitare.
And first occurrit to my remembering
How that I was in service with the king
Put to his grace in eris tenderest,
Clerk of his comptis, youcht I was inding
With heart and hand and every other thing
That mycht him pleis in any manner best.
Quhill hie inuy me from his service kest,
Be thaym that had the court in governing
As bird but plumes heryit of the nest.
Our life, our giding, and our auenturis
Dependis from their heavenly creaturis
Apperandlie be sum necessite.
For youcht ane man wald set his besy cutis
So far as labor and his wisdom furis
To fle hard chance of infortunite.
Youcht he eschew it with difficulte,
The cursit weird it Ithandlie enduris
Geuin to him first in his natiuite.
Of erdlie stait beualing thus the chance
Of fortoun good I had na esperance.
So lang I swomit in her seis deip
That sad auising with her thochtfull lance
Couth find na port to ankir her firmance,
Quhill Morpheus the dery god of sleip
For very reuth did on my curis weip.
And set his sleuth, and deidly contenance
With snorand vanis throw my body creip*
Me thocht I was in to ane plesand meid
Quhare flora maid the tender blewmys spreid
Throw kyndlie dew and humouris nutratiue.
Quhen goldin Titan with his fla^mis reid
Above the seis rasit up his heid,
Diffounding down his heit restoratiue
To every fruit that nature maid on live.
Quhilk was before in to the winter deid
For stormys called and frostis penitriue.
Ane silver fontane sprang of watter cleir
In to that place, quhare I approchit neir.

Of courtly gallandis in their best maneir,

With thaym I saw ane crownit king appeir
With tendir downis rising on his beird.
Their courtly gallandis settand their intentis
To sing, and play, on diverse instrumentis
According to this princis appetit.
Two plesand ladyis come pransand ouir the bentis.

Quhat heart mycht wis they wantit noch^ ane myt.

Before this prince fell down upon their kneis.
Syne dressit thaym in to their best auyse

And him desyrit for his hie empryis

Gyf it unto thy pleseir be ane fo,
Or truble thy mind with curis dolorus.

Defraudand god of nature genius.

Two heavy and gross, and two ar lycht and pure.

Ane man newborn beginnis to appeir
In other figure than before was taken.
Quhen he is deid, the mateir dois remane.
Youcht it resolve in to sum new maneir,
No thing is new, nocht bot the form is gane.
Thus is no thing in erd bot fugitive
Passand and cumand be spreiding successiue.
And as ane beist, so is ane man consaue
Of seid infuse in membris genitive.
And forth his time in pleseir dois ouir drive

Thairfore thy heuyn and pleseir now ressaue
Quhill thou art heir in to this present live.
For eftir deith thou sall na plesier have.

Bot gyf they will unto thy lust inclyne.
Gyf thou desyris in the seis fleit

For it is said be clerkis of renoun
Their is na pleseir in this eird so great
As quhen ane luffar dois his lady meit
To quikin his life of money deidly swon.
As hiest pleseir but comparison

Ane lusty halk with money plumys broun.
Quhilk salbe found so Ioyus and pleasant
Gyf thou unto her merry flychtis hant,
Of every blys that may in erd appeir
As heart will think thou sall no plente want.
Quhill eris swift with quhelis properant
Consume thy strenth, and all thy bewte cleir.
And quhen Delight had said on this maneir
As rage of outheid thocht may releuant.

Nor bitter deith may bring unto rewyne.
Bot thou mon first insuf^er mekill pyne,
Above thy self that thou may have empire.
Than sall thy fame, and honor have na fine.
My realm is set amang my fois all
Quhilkis hes with me ane weir continewall,
And euir still dois on my bordour ly.
And youcht, they may no wayis me ouir thrall
They ly in wait, gif any chance may fall
Of me sum time to get the victory.
Thus is my life ane Ithand cheualry.
Laubour me haldis strange as any wall,
And no thing brekis me bot slogardy.
Na fortoun may aganis me auaill.
Youcht scho with cludy stormis me assaill,
I brek the streme of scharp aduersite.
In weddir louin and may tempestius haill
But any dreid I beir ane equal saill.
My schip so strange that I may neuir de.
Wit, reason, manheid gouernis me so hie,
No influence nor sterris may preuaill
To regne on me with infortunite.
The rage of outheid may nocht dantit be
But great distres and scharp aduersite
As be this reason is experience.
The finest gold, or silver that we se
May nocht be wrocht to our vtilite
But fla^mis kene and bitter violence.
The more distres, the more intelligence.
Quhay salis lang in hie prosperity
Ar sone ouitset be stormy violence.
This fragill life (as moment enduring)
But dout sall the and every people bring
To sickir blis, or than eternal woe.
Gyf thou be honest lauboure dois ane thing,
Thy panefull laubour sall vanes but tarying
Howbeit thy honest werkis do nocht so,
Gyf thou be lust dois any thing also,
The schamefull deid without disseuering
Remanis ay, quhen pleseir is ago.
As Caruell tycht fast tending throw the sea
Leuys na prent amang the wallis hie.
As birdis swift with money besy plume
Peirsis the air, and wait nocht quhare they fle.
Siclik our life without actiuite
Gyffis na frut, howbeit ane schado blume.
Quhay dois their life in to this e^d consume
Without virtew, their fame and memory
Sall vanis sone^, than the ^eky ^inne.
As watter purgis, and makis bodyis fair.
As fire be nature ascendis in the air,
And purifyis with heitis vehement.
As flower dois smell. As fruit is nurisare,
As precius balm reuertis thingis sare
And makis thaym of rot impacient.
As spice may sweet, as ros may redolent,
As stern of day be moving circulare
Chasis the nycht with bemis resplendent.
Siclik my werk perfitis every wycht
In fervent luf of may excellent lycht,
And makis man in to this erd but peir.
And dois the saul fra all corruptioun dycht
With odoure dulce, and makis it more brycht
Than Diane full, or it Appollo cleir.
Syne rasis it unto the hiest speir,
Immortaly to schyne in goddis sycht
As chosin spous, and creature most deir.
This other wenche, that clepit is delight
Inuoluis man be sensual appetite
In every kind of vice, and misery.
Because na wit, nor reason is perfect
Quhare seho is gyde. Bot skaithis infinite
With doloure, schame, and urgent powerte.
For scho was get of frothis of the sea.
Quhilk signifies, her pleseir vennomit
Is mydlit ay with scharp aduersite.
Duke Hanniball (as money authouris wrait)
Throw Spane come be money passage strait
To Italy in furour bellicall.
Brak down the wallis, and the montanis slait,
And to his army maid ane oppin gait,
And victoryis had on the Romany all.
At Capua be pleseir sensual
This duk was maid so soft, and deligait.
That with his fois he was sone ouir thrall.
Of feirs Achill the weirlie dedis sprang
In Troy, and Greece. Quhill he in virtew rang.
How lust him slew, it is bot reuth to heir.
Siclik the Troianis with their knychtis strange
The vaileant Grekis fra their roumes dang
Uictoriuslie exercit money eir.
That nycht, they went to their lust and pleseir,
The fatal horse did throw their wallis fang.
Quhais prignant sidis were full of men of weir.
Satdanapall the prince effeminat
Fra knychtlie dedis was degenerat,
Twinand the thredis of the purpur lynt
With fingaris soft amang the ladyis sat.
And with his lust couth nocht be saciat
Quhill of his fois come the bitter dynt.
Quhat nobill men and ladyis hes been tynt
Quhen they with lustis were intoxicat,
To schaw at lenth, my tongue should neuir stynt,
Thairfore Camil the vaileant cheualeir
(Quhen he the Gallis had dantit be his weir)
Of heritable landis wald have na recompense.
For gyf his barnis, and his freindis deir
Were virtewis, they couth nocht fall ilk eir
To have yneuch be Roman providence.
Gif they were geuin to vice and insolence.
It was nocht neidfull for to conques geir
To be occasioun of their incontinence.
Sum nobill men as (poetis list declare)

That glore immortal in their lyuis wan.
Quhy were their people callit goddis than?
Because they had ane virtew singular

And otheris ar in reik sulphurius.

The proud giandis. And thristy Tantalus
With huglie drink and fude most vennomus,
Quhare fla^mis bald and mirknes ar sensibill.
Quhy ar their folk in panis so terribill?
Because they were bot schrewis vicius
In to their life, with dedis most horribill.
And youcht na fruit were eftir consequent
Of mortal life. Bot for this world present
Ilk man to have allanerlie respect.

As quik fra deid. As rich fr^ indigent.
That ane to glore and honor ay direct.

This other of beistis following the affect.
For he that nold aganis his lustis strive,
Bot leiffis as beist of knawlege sensitive,
Eildis richt fast, and deith him sone ouir halis.
Thairfore the mule is of ane langar live
Than stomt horse. Also the barant wiue
Apperis oung, quhen that the brudie falis.
We se also, quhen nature nocht preualis.

Danting the rage of outheid furius.

With lang empire, and hie felicite.
Or haif ane moment sensualite
Of fuliche outh in life voluptuous,
And all thy dayis full of misery.
Be than Phoebus his fiery cart did wry
Fra south to west declinand besaly
To dip his steidis in the occeane.
Quhen he began oui^sile his visage dry
With vapou^is thik, and cloudis full of sky.
And notus brym the wynd metidiane

Quhen he contempnit lust and ydilnes*
That he in virtew micht his life decore
And werkis did of may excellent glore.
The more incressit his panefull besines,

I tuke purpos or I forthir went
To write the story of this regioun,
With dedis of money illuster campioun.
And youcht the pane apperis vehement.
To make the story to the redaris more patent,
I will begin at the discriptioun
Of Albion in manner subsequent.
Finis.
Heir begynnis the Cosmographe and description of Albion.
How all thyngis is sub devvit to alteratioun and deith. and na thing
permanent in the erd. Ca. primo.
I Traist nane hes sa dirk intelligence. Bot knawis Cosmographye may necessar
to the knawlege of hystoryis. And it to dis^riue the samyn is the office of na
small ingyne. Attoure all the auctouris (yt hes wryttyn upon the description of
the world) ar patent and knawin to ilk regioun and pepyll. Amang quhome hes
been money crafty and resolut men schawing money great thyngis above ingine of
men, with so profound sentence* that the samyn is na thing different fra the
verite in description of money uncouth and diverse thingis succeding contynewally
to the great co^modite and pleseir of reders. it sen the matter (that they treit)
is not solid nor permanent in the samyn form and image as it was first found,
Apperis both to vnletterit pepil and vtheris quhilkes hes na sicht to the
continewal alteration of materis, that ye verite is not schawin to thaym in all
partis. And sen all thyngis (quhilkis ar comprehendit within the speir of the moon) ar sa thirlit to deith and alteration, ye (...) or other consumit before
ws, or ellis we before yame, Apperis na thing mair corruptible, nor it of mair
alteratioun than the erd and situatioun thairof. Be^^us it changis sa money
figuris be lang age and process of eris. For we nocht (...) may se presently be
our Ene, bot fyndis be money crafty and profound (...). That quhare sum time
been may notable cietes or may plen^^^us lesuris and medois, now throw erd
quaik and trymblyng, or ellis be continewall inundation of watteris, nocht
remanis bot other the huge seys or ellis ^nproffitable ground and sandis.
Attoure y^ see be alluu^oun and pres of rage and ^^t^ers cumys in on sum
landis, and gangis forth on vtheris, as daily occurris be experience. For both
seys and watteris geuis be iniust merchis als mekle to sum landis, as they reif
fra vtheris. Heirfore I belief be syndry chances and lang process of time, yt
every thing sall not be respondent to the samyn perfection and knawlege, as it
was discriuit ^e auld cosmographouris in the figure and situation of the erd.
Thairfore na man should have admiration, howbeit recent ^^^houris discriue ye
world in sum vthir figure and sort, than it hes been discriuit before be
Pompouius mela, Ptholome, and other auld cosmographouris. For the erd is now
mair frequent in pepyl, tha^ it was in they dayis, and the passage in all
cuntreis mair knawin. Throw quhilk the situation of all regionis be exact and
scharp deligence of authouris is the mair patent. Artoure gif their auld
cosmographouris war bot men (as we are) followis na admiration. Howbeit they had
na sicker cognosance and full erudition of al thingis. And for yat cause they
mycht not wryt forthir than they saw be their a win inquisition. Or ellis be
experience of vtheris authoures past before yame. For their reasonis we think it
lytyl wrang sum times nocht to follow al their opinionis, for they had not
knawlege nor experience of all materis. And thairfore we dar the mair baldly
wryt su^ things for ye common proffet specially concerning ye figure and
situation of scotland with the maneris of the pepyll thairof in su^ vthir sort,
than hes been schawin before be vthir authouris. For we have not only seen the
samyn bot hes knawlege thairof be lang experience and use. Throw quhilk yis our
quhat sumeuir werk sal not be vnprofitabyl, nor it vnplesand to ye reders. For
in it saw schawin the maneris and conditioun of the pepill of scotland with
the situation thairof. Attoure to make ye reders more bowsum and attent, we pro
mit faithfully to writ na thing in this werk bot allanerlie sik thing as been
may patent and knawin to ws. Other be our awin exact deligence and industrye,
or ellis be rehers of otheris rycht true and faithful auctouris. And thairfore
gyf this our werk be found plesand to the reders, we sall writ sum other tym
mair largely of other materis batth to their eruditioun and pleseir.

The discriptioun of Albion and quhy it was callit with that name. The
beginning of Britonis and Scottis. Ca. ii.
THe hail I Will of Albion, quhilk contenis both the realms of Ingland and
Scotland, as is discriuit be ye latyne and greik cosmographouris is enueronyd
on every side with the great occeane. Hauand on the eist side the Almane seis.
On the south side the Franche and Britane seis. On the west side the Ireland
seis. And on the north side the Norroway seis. Yis I Will is extendit be lang
passage fra the southsoutheist to the northnorwest. And is mair extendit to the
lenth than breid, nocht far different fra the figure of ane triangle. This I Will
be auld cosmographouris was callit Albion and remanis it under the samyn name.
Sum auctouris sayis this I Will was callit Albion ab albis montibus. That is to
say, fra the quhit montanis thairof full of calk. Utheris allegis it was callit
Albion fra ane lady namit Al^yne. Quhilk history is nocht vnlik the fabulis
that are writin of the.l. vouchteris of Danaus king of Argiues. Yis Albyne (as
is allegit) with her.l. sisteris (eftir that they had slane al their husbandis)
pullit up salis and come out of Greece throw the seis of Hercules to Spane. And
fra Spane come throw ye Franche and Almane seis but any impediment to ye said
I Will. And eftir her arriving in the samyn namyt it Albion fra her name. Yis
Albyne with her.l. systeris eftir their cumyng in the said I Will conuersit with
deuillis in form of men. And consauit childrin be natural co^mixtion. Their
childrin increscit of sa huge stature and pissance, that they were callit be ye
people giandis. And inhabit the said regioun continewallie to the time of Brutus
the first beginner of Britonis. This Brutus was nepot or ellis pronepot to the
great troiane Eneas. And because he was exilit and banist for slauchter and other
great offencis done be him in Italy, he was constranit to depart with ye
residew of Troianis his fallois to ^erche sum new dwelling. Eftir lang travel
be tempestius and storm seis he arriuit in Albion fra the beginning of the
world.iiii.M.xxvii. eris. This Brutus and his fallowis eftir their cumyng in
Albioun inuadit the Giandis before rehersit with sindry chancis of battall. And
finalie brocht thaym to sa hie rewyne, that both yair landis and guddis fell
in pray to Brutus and his fallowis. And sa ye cuntre was callit Britane. And ye
pepill Britonis. Bot the beginning of Scottis was in ane vthir manner. It is
writtin be our anciant historiographouris, that Gathelus ane rycht illuster and
vaileant knycht discending be lang progressioun and lynage of ye blud riall of
Greece marijt Scota douchter to king Pharo of Egypt, and youcht money rich
landis fell to him with great honouris be singular manheid in ye realm of
Egypt. it he was so astonist be money terrible and greuus plagis appering be
prophecy of Moses in plane euersioun of the realm and people of Egypt, that he
thoucht na thing sa good nor proffitable, as to be may remote and dista^t
thairfra. Gathelus mouit for their causis come forth of ye mouth of Nyle with
his wife, his freindis and seruandis, Grekis and Egiptianis, throw the seis
mediterrane. And finalie brokin with lang and incredible danger of uncouth
chancis, he arriuit in the north part of Spane. And to conques the more
benevolence of his wife, he namit his pepill Scottis eftir her name. Yair

ane band of weirmen in Ireland. Quhilkis be singular manheid and prudence
dantit so the pepill thairof, that they gat the hail empire of the said I Will.
And ^ang in it money eris eftir with great honor and glore of armies.

How the scottis and Pich^is come in Albioun. Of their syndry lynnage and
maneris. And how the said I Will was inhabit be three syndry pepyll. Ca. iii.
NOthesay ane of the kyngis sonnis of Ireland come schort eris eftir with ane
cumpany of oung and hardy pepill in the Ilis of Albion. And because he fand the
samyn waist and nocht inhabit as yan with any empire of Britonis, he sat down
with his remanent fallowis, wiffis, and barnis in ye said Ilis. And namit thaym
Hebredes fra the name of Hibernia, or ellis fra the name of Hiber the first son
of Gathelus. Yis Rothesay come sone eft with his freindis out of the said Ilis
in Albion. And sa mekil as he gat possessioun of, (...) callit it Scotland. The
day that Scottis come first in Albion was fra the beginning of the
world.iiii.M.vi.C.xvii. eris. Money eris eft their cummyng in Albion they were
callit realbi^is, that is to say, kyngis of Albioun to make thaym sum thing
different fra the remanent kyngis that inhabit ye said land eftir or before
their cumyng. Forthir youcht the Scottis be their singular manheid and
prudence rang continewallie but any interruption both in Spane and Ireland, it
their name is perist in yai partis. Other be yair co^mixtion with uncouth blud,
or ellis be roust and lang process of eris. Throw quhilk remanis na scottis in
memory. Bot they that inhabitis the last boundis of Albion. Attoure the
Spaneartis that dwellis it in ye montanis and vthir desertis of Spane) knawis
na thing of the Roman weris. And ar lityll different fra Ireland men both in
their maneris, habit, and langage. Ye Britonis (because they were money eris before
ws in Albioun) occupyis ye south and may plentuus boundis thairof. And we
inhabit the north partis full of montanis, quhilk ar nocht sa fertile and
co^modius as the said landis occupiit be Britonis. Eftir the cumyng of Scottis
and Britonis on this manner in Albioun, ane uncouth people namit Pychtis,
vthirwayis namit Agathirsanis (quhilkis were banist out of Sarmathia) come in
Denmark, quhair they sone eftir gat schippis with all prouisioun efferyng
thairto. And eftir their final arriuyng in Albioun they sat down in the waist
and myddil boundis betuix Britonis and Scottis, and maid wyd marchis betuix
both their realms. The cumyng of Pychtis in Albioun was eftir the cumyng of
Scottis in the samyn.ii.C.l. eris it amang sum authouris rysis ane fuliche
dout, quhidd the Scottis or Pychtis come first in this regioun. Sum of their
authouris al legis, that Rewther was the first beginnar of Scottis in Albioun.
Bot this opinioun is far different fra the treuth of our history. For five
scottis kingis rang continewallie ilk ane succeding to vthis before Rewther, as
apperis ^leirke in the history following. And sa this I Will of Albioun was
inhabit fra the beginning thairof with three sindry pepill, that is to say,
Britonis, Scottis, and Pichtis. The first part of this I Will (Because it was
inhabit be Brutus and his posterite) was namit Britane. The secound and myd
part (because it was inhabit be Pichtis) was namit Penthland. And the remanent
bou^dis thairof were inhabit be Scottis and namyt Scotland. it the Roman
historicianis and Ptolome (quhe^ yai treit any thing concerning this I Will of
Albioun) callit ye hail I Will Britane, and all the people thairof Britonis, Their
three people namit all under ane name Albianis, inhabit ye said I Will. it the
romany in all partis quhare they come within this I Will namit the people thairof
with sindry names. For they namit the men of Walis Tegenianis fra Tegenia. Ye
men of Angus Horrestianis, fra Horrestia. Ye men of Cauder and Callender wod
Calidonianis, fra Calidonia. Ye men of Galloway Brigandis fra Brigantia as
apperis be Cornelius Tacitus, quhilk writis that beound ye Britonis dwellis in
Allbion to ye great north, two people richt different fra other in maneris and
nature, yat ane for yair allo hair callit Pichtis discendyng of Albianis. And
this vthir for their blak and curland Hair callit Scottis, na thing different
fra Spancartis in nature and conditionis. Yis I Will in our dayis is inhabit
allanerlie be two people Inglismen and Scottis. Ye south partis ar inhabit be
Inglismen, and the north part be Scottis. Now have we schawin the causis quhy
the Britonis were callit with that name, and the manner of their cummyng in
Albioun. And we sall schaw in the end of this cosmographie with quhat people the
realm of Britane hes been inhabit continewallie unto the time of king Hary
ye.viii. regnand now with great felicite above Inglismen.

The boundis of Albioun with the sindry co^moditeis thairof in general. Of
the great infirmiteis that fallis to the people thairof for their intemperance.
And of ye religion vsit be thaym in auld times. ca. iiii.
THe I Will of Albioun contenis in the hail circumference and compass circular two
thousand mylis, hauand in lenth.vii.C. mylis, and in breid.iii.C.l. mylis. As
apperis weill be the fu^ thairof fornence the Franche seis. And fra the fute
thairof it procedis ay the more small, quhill it come to ye vter marchis and
last boundis both of Ingland and scotland. For betuix the Mule of Galloway
fornence the Ireland seis to sanct Ebbis heid fornence the Almane seis, ar
skars ane hundredth and.lx. mylis in breid. And frathens it gaderis ay mair
small, quhill it be cumyn to the last boundis thairof, quhare it hes
skarslie.xxx. mylis in breid. It is ane rycht profitable I Will full of people. And
nocht only rycht plentuus of store and bestiall ^ot of all kind of cornys in
every boundis thairof, saiffing allanerlie they boundis quhair god of his
singular gudnes hes ordanit may rich mynis of gold, silver, tynne, bras,
copper, and quik siluir, with sic fouth and abundance of metallis, that the
samyn ar nocht only sufficient for all manner of necessaris to the people of the
said I Will. Bot ar sufficient to all vthir our nychtbouris that dwellis about
ws, gyf our people had perfect craft and industrye to win the samyn. Bot the
superflew abundance of all vthir thyngis necessar to the use of man (quhilk
nature hes producit in our regioun) makis the people the les industrius and
crafty delyi^ng ay mair in sleuth than any exercitioun. For beside the great
fouth of gers, cornis, and bestiall in our landis, beside the great abundance
of fowlis in the air, sa great plente is of fische in all partis of our feis,
specially towart the north, that ye samyn is sufficient yneuch to nuris all our
people howbeit their were na frutis growand on our land, as apperis be
experience. For all landis yat lyis about ws as France, Flanderis Zeland,
Holland, and mekill of Almany, cumys with sindry flotis sekand fische eirlie in
our seis. And nocht allanerlie be their prudent industry wynnis fische
sufficient to sustene thaym self. Bot be general marchandyce of yir fische
they sustene the people of all vthir cuntreis, passand in the time of lentroun
throw ye seis mediterrane ay selland their fische to yair great proffet and
winning. Money vthir rich and precius thingis ar to be gottin in ye said I Will*
haldin in great delit to ye eist people of the world, quhat may be said of our
wol? quhilk is sa quhit and small, that the samyn is desyrit be all people, and
cof^ with great price, specially with marchandis quhair it is best knawn. Of
this woll is maid the fine skarlettis with money vthir granit and deligat
clathis. Heirfore I dar baldlie affirm, gif the Albianis had sic grace, that
yai mycht leif with concord amang thaym self, or gif their realms be any
honest way mycht cum under the empire and senorie of ane king, they mycht nocht
allanerlie haif all necessaris within thaym self vncoft, bot with small
difficulty mycht dant all nychtbouris and cuntreis lyand thaym about, quhen
any externe or h^^outh weris hapnit to inuaid thaym. They have sa elegant
stature, sa fair and lusty bodyis, that na vthir people may be preferrit to
thaym. They ar rycht ingenius and abill als weil to letteris as vthir virtewis
and corporal exercitioun of the handis, rycht hardy and reddy to all
ieoperdyis both in weir and peace, in sic manner that na thing may be difficill
to thaym ^if they leiffit temperatlie. Thairfore the provident beginnar of ye
world hes nocht but great resoun maid their region nakit and bair of wynis,
Knawing be his eterne wisdom that wynis (howbeit the samyn ar rycht necessar
to all vthir people) ar rycht skaithfull to the nature of Albianis. For they ar
geuin to sic unnatural voracite and desire of uncouth metis and drinkis, that
they can nocht refrene thaym self fra immoderat excess. As apperis weill be
experience. For throw their crapulus and schamfull glutone they ar strikin
oftymes with sa dangerus and irremediable infirmiteis* that howbeit thou were
accumpanyt with thaym all their tender age, thou sall find thaym throw their
intemperance and surfeit di^t sa fowsumlie growin in their myd or latter age,
that they sall appeir als uncouth to thy sycht, as thou had neuir knawin thaym
in yair tender age. Quhairthrow they sal appeir erar misfassonyt monstouris
than any natural people. Sindry of thaym throw surfeit diet growis furius in
their latter age with money sorrowful maledeis following thaym. For as ye
proverb sayis, sendyll ar men of great glutonie seen have lang dayis or agit
with process of eris. Because their excessive and intemperat diet consumys all the
substanciall humouris of their bodyis. Bot we will return to our purpos. The
Albianis (as writis Caesar in his co^mentaris and Cornelius Tacitus) were rycht
religious eftir the ryte that was in they dayis. For in they dayis were ye
preistis of Britane namyt Driades rycht expert both in natural and moral
Philosophy. Be their doctrine come the first sculis of their sect and opinion
in France. The principal s^ct of their preisti^ was in the I Will of Man, quhilk
was in that time the spectacle and fontane of all honest ^^uditioun and
letteris. And fra their preistis we^ anis professed in catholic faith, they
presen^i^ with great constance in it but any spot of he^if^.

THe Pichtis had sum time the principal and may plenteus boundis of al y^

may hardy at ieoperdyis, rycht agill and deliver of bodyis, rycht ingenius to

The cause quhy the swannis multiplyis sa fast in this loch is throw ane herb

ON the south side of Forth lyis Louthiane, callit with tha^ name fra Lothane
of the principal kingis of Pichtis. Louthiane is may plentuus ground of
Scotland. In it ar money abbayis, castellis, and tounis, as Hadingtoun, Dunbar,
Northberwik, Leith, bot Edinburgh passis thaym all both in polese, reparation,

hes ane singular vittew aganis all manner of cankir and skawis. Nocht far fra
the mouth of forth is the castle of Dunbar, quhilk be nature and crafty
industre of man is the strenthiest house this day of Albion. Dunbar was su^ time
ye chief chemis of ye erlis of March. Nocht far fra it is ane town under the
same name with ane magnificent and rich college of channons foundit and
honorabily dotat be the said erlis. On the eist side of louthiane lyis the
Mers, the cuntre quhilk be ws is first diser^uit. Under ye Mers lyis Teuidail.
And above it lyis Twedail. Under Twedail lyis Dryisdaill, Waulco^dail,
Douglasdail, and Clidisdaill. All their dalis beris the name of that reuer that
discendis throw thaym. The principal town of Clidisdail is Glasqw the
archebischoppis seit, quhare ane nobill kirk is dotat richly in the honor of
sanct Mungow, and biggit with great magnificence. In Glasqw is ane general
university and study of all liberal science. In Clidisdail is ane rich mine
of gold and asure won but any laubour. Su^ times ar won in it sindry precious

with infinite riches be this mine, gy^ god had fortunit him to have had dayis.
Now be sleuth and necligence of vncrafty people this mine dois small proffet.
Fra Glasqw north lyis Menteith, and Striuelingschire marcheand with Argyle and
Lennox. In Striuelingschire is ye town of Striueling. And above it standis ye
castle under ye samyn name, sum time namit the dolorus montane. At this town
began ye great wod of Calidon. This wod of Calidon ran fra Striueling throw
Menteith and Stratherne to Atholl and Lochquhabir. As Ptolome writtis in his
first table. In this wod was sum time quhit bullis, with crisp and cursand mane
like feirs lionis, and youcht they semit meik and tame in the remanen^ figure
of their bodyis yai were mair wyld than any vthir beistis, and had sic hatrent
aganis the societe and cu^pany of men, yt yai come neuir in ye woddis nor

eit nocht of the herbis yt were twichit or handillit be me^. Their bullis were sa
wyld yt yai were neuir taken but slycht and crafty laubour, and sa impacient yat
eftir their taking they deit for importable doloure. Als sone as any man
inuadit their bullis, they ruschit with so terrible preis on him, that they dang
him to the eird, ^akand^a feir of houndis, scharp laneis, nor vthir may
penitriue wappinnis. It is said, king Robert Bruce eftir his coronatioun went
to ane hunting in this wod, hauand bot ane quiet cu^panye with him. And
eschapit narowlie of his lyef. For ane of the bullis (eftir that he was sair
woundit be the huntaris) ruschit feirslie on the king. Howbeit he had na
wapinnis in his hand to debait him self fra the dynt thairof. Incontinent ane
man of great spreit (quhilk was standing neir by) lap before the king. And nocht
allanerlie kest the bull be manifest force to the erd, bot held him quhill the
remanent huntaris slew him with their wappinnis. This man that rescoursit the
king was callit Turnbull, and was rewardit with rich landis be the king. And
youcht their bullis were bred in sindry boundis of the Callidon wod, now be
continewal hunting and lust of insolent men they ar distroyit in all partis of
Scotland and nane of thaym left bot allanerlie in Cumarnald. on the eist side
of Menteith lyis Strathern, and marchis on the samyn side with Fiffe. Out throw
the valis of this regioun rynnis the watter of Ern and fallis in Tay, and nocht
four mylis fra ye place quhare* Ern fallis in Tay, is ane stane of small

ane man and ane hundredth mouis it elik. On the tothir side of Tay beound Angus
and Gowrie lyis Stermond, ane plentuus regioun both of Gers and cornis. Nocht
far fra Stermond lyis Athole, in quhilkis ar money lusty valis and fludis full of
fische and the ground sa rich, that it beris cornis but any lauboure. In it is
ane town namit Lud, of quhilk the land is sa plentuus. That gif it be weil

contrarius nature. The quheit that is sawin in it, degeneris and turnis in Ry.
Under Buchquhane and Boene to the west, lyis Bostgewell and Gareoth rycht
plentuus regionis both in gres and cornis. In Gareoth is ane hill namit
Doundore, that is to say the goldin montane. The scheip that gangis on yis
montane ar allo, their teith ar hewit like gold, their flesche reid as it were

Of the great plente of haris, hartis, and vthir vvild bestiall in scotland* Of
the meruellus nature of syndr^ Scotti^ doggis, And of the nature of Salmond.
Ca. xi.
Because we have discriuit all regionis of Scotland in special, we will schaw
sum thing concerning thaym in general. And first we say, that in all boundis of
Scotland except yai partis (quhair continewall habitatioun of people makis
impediment yairto) is great plente of haris, hartis, hindes, dayis, raise,
wolffis, wyld horse, and roddis. Yir wild horse are not taken but crafty slycht.
For in time of winter the landwart people puttis certane tame cursouris and
merls amang their wild horse. And be their co^mixtioun and frequent cumpanye,
makis thaym so tame, that they may be handilli^. The Uolffis ar rycht noysum to
the tame bestiall in all partis of Scotland, except ane part thairof namit
Glenmores. In quhilk ye tame bestiall gettis litill damage of wyld bestiall
specialie of toddis. For tik house of this cuntre nurisis ane oung tod certane
dayis, and mengis the flesche yairof (eftir yt it be slane) with sic meit as
they gif to yair fowlis or vthir small beistis. And sa money as etis of this meit
ar preseruit two monethis eftir fra any damage of toddis. For toddis will eit
na flesche that gustis of their awin kind. And be their bot ane beist or fowll,
that hes nocht gustit of this meit, the tod will ^heis it out amang ane
thousand. In Scotland ar doggis of meruellus nature. For above the co^moun
nature and conditioun of doggis, quhilkis ar seen in all partis, ar three manner
of doggis in Scotland, quhilk ar seen in na vthir partis of the world. The
first is ane hound both wycht, hardy and swift. Their houndis ar nocht
allan^^lie feirs and cruel on all wyld beistis. Bot on theuis and ennymes to
their master on the same manner. The secound kind is ane rache, that sekis
their pray, both of fowlis, beistis and fische be sent and smell of their
neis. The third kind is mair than any rache. Reid hewit or ellis blak with
small spraingis of spottis, and ar callit be the people sleuthoundis. Their
doggis hes sa meruellus wit, that yai search theuis and followis on thaym
allanerlie be sent of the guddis that are taken away. And nocht allanerlie fyndis
the theif, bot inuadis him with great cruelte. And youcht the theuis oftymes
cors the watter, quhair they pas, to cause ye hound to tyne the sent of thaym
and the guddis. it he serchis heir and their with sic deligence, that be his
fut he fyndis both the trace of the theif and the guddis. The meruellus nature
of yir houndis will have na faith with uncouth people. Howbeit the samyn ar rycht
frequent and ryfe on the bordouris of Ingland and Scotland. Attour it is
statute be the lawis of the bordouris, he that denyis entres to the sleuthound
in time of chase and serching of guddis, salbe haldin participant with the
crime and thift co^mittit. Of fowlis sic as leiffis of reif, ar sindry kyndis
in Scotland, as ernis, falconis, goyshalkis, spa^halkis, marlonis. and sik like
fowlis. Of watter fowlis is sa great noumer, yat it is wonder to heir. Money
vthir fowlis ar in Scotland, quhilkis ar seen in na vthir partis of the world,
as capercaile ane foul mair than ane rauin, quhilk leiffis allanerlie of barkis
of treis. In Scotland ar money mure rokis and hennis, quhilk etis nocht bot seid
or ^r^ppis of hadder. Sic like ar great noumer of blak cokis and hennis, nocht
unlike to ane fa^^ane both in quantite and sapoure of yair flesche. Bot they
have blak fedderis and reid ^e breis And beside their three uncouth kind of
fowlis, is ane vthir kind of fowlis in the Mers mair uncouth, namit gustardis,
als me^le as ane swan, bot in the color of their fedderis and gust of their
flesche they ar litil different fra ane pertrik, their last fowlis are not
frequent bot in few noumer. And sa far haytis the cumpany of man, that gif they
find their eggis ayndit or twichit be men, they leif thaym, and layis eggs in
ane other place. They lay yair eggis in the bair erd. All other kind of fowlis
ar in Scotland on the same manner as yai ar in any other realms. Of fische is
mair plente in Scotland specially of salmond, tha^ is in any* vthir partis of
ye world. And because the procreation and nature of salmond is uncouth and
strange, we have inserit the manner thairof in this buke. Their salmond in the
time of heruist, eumis up throw the small watteris, specially quhare ye watter
is may schauld and loun, and spawnis with their wamis plet to vthir. Ye hie
fische spawnis his meltis. And ye scho fische ^ir rounis. And incontinent
coueris thaym ouir with sand in the reueir. And ^ftir their spawning they grow
sa lene and small, that na thing apperis on thaym bot skyn and bane, and hes sa
warsche gust that they ar unprofitable to eit. Sum men sayis all other salmond
that metis thaym eftir their spawning growis lene on the same manner as they ar.
For sindry of thaym ar found lene on the ta side, and fat on the tothir.
Forthir of their rownis and meltis quhilkis at hid (as said is) under the
sandis, growis at the spring of the nixt ei^ (...) render fische, na gretar
than ane mannis thoume. And gyf they be handillit, they melt away like ane blob
of watter. Alwayis at the first streme of watter that risis yai descend to the sea. And within.xx. dayis eftir yai grow in meruellus quantite. And with may
fervent desire and appetite returnis to the samyn placis, quhair they were
generit. Forthir because money of ye watteris of Scotland ar full of lynnis, als
sone as their salmond cumis to ye lyn, they lei^. And s^ money as ar wycht or
lepis weil, they get up throw the lyn. And returnis to the place quhair they
were bred, and abidis their quhil the season ^um of their generatioun. Utheris
quhilkis lepis nocht cleirlie ouir the lyn, brekie thaym self be their fall and
growis mesall, vtheris ar kepp^t in caw^rounis. for the la^d wart people settis
oftymes cawdronis playand with hair watter at the cheik of the lyn. Thus quhen
the salmondis faillis their loup* they fall callour in the said caldrounis, and
a^ than may delitius to the mouth. It is defendit be our lawis to sla any
salmond fra ye.viii. day of september to the.xv. day of nouembre. Na man knawis
quhair on their fische leiffis. For na thing is found in their wambe quhen they
ar oppinnit, bot ane thi^ gross humor.

NOw we will schaw the nature of mussillis and coclis* of quhilkis money kyndis

Utheris ar mair, nocht unlike in form and quantite to the samyn mussillis ya^

gottin in sindry reueris specialie in De and Done And in their mussillis ar
generit the perlis. Their mussillis (...) in the morning (quhen the lift is
cleir and temperat) opnis their mouthis a litill above the watter, and may
gredelie swellis the dew of the heuin, and eftir the mesure and quantite of the
dew that they swellie, they consaue and bredis the perle. Their mussillis ar sa
doyn gleg of twiche and heryng, that howbeit the voce be neuir so small that is
maid on the bra beside thaym, or the stane be neuir sa small that is cassin in
the watter they douk haistelie atanis, and ganges to the ground, knawing weill
in quhat estimatioun and price the fruit of yair wambe is to al people. Als sone
as the fischaris fyndis yir mussillis, they thrist thaym fast togidder. The
manner of their taking followis. First four or five personis passis in the reuer
togidder, and standis in manner of ane round cirkill within the watter to their
schulderis. Ilk ane of thaym hes ane staff in their hand, that they sall nocht
slide, and syne they luke and viseis throw the cleir and purifyit watter
quhill they se the mussillis. And because yai may nocht tak thaym up with their
handis they cleik thaym up with their tayis, and slingis thaym to the nixt
brayis. The perlis that are gottin in Scotland ar nocht of littill valor. For
they have ane cleir schynand quhitnes round and lycht. And sum times ar als
mekleas the naill of ane mannis fyngar* of quhilkes we have had part. It was
schawin to we be thaym yat come fra sanct James, that their is siclike
mussillis in Spane, bot they have na perle, for they leif in salt watter. In
all the sea costis of Scotland ar coclis and mussillis on the same manner youcht
tha be mair proffitable to the mouth than any procreatioun of perlis. Money
uncouth form and figuris of fische ar in scotland. Sum of thaym armyt with
schellis, sum with hard skalis. And sum of thaym ar round as ane ball bakkit
like ane hurcheon, haua^d bot ane conduc^ both to purge their wambe and
ressaue their mei^. To schaw every kind of fische that is in Scotland, it were
bot ane faschious and vane lauboure. For the samyn ar knawin to al cuntreis. Of
al other kyndis of fische is sa great plente throw all partis of our seis, that
howbeit infinite noumer of thaym were taken away on the ta day, na thing thairof
salbe mist on the morrow. Attoure ane thing is that cumys not but singular
providence of god, for ay ye mair derth and penurite of vittallis is in
Scotland, the fische swoumis with the more abundance and plente. Attoure in all

The discriptioun of the Ilis of Scotland, and of the may notabyll thingis
thairof. Capitulo. xiii,
SEn we are now falling in co^monyng of the Ilis we will discriue ye same in
manner and form as followis. Fornens scotland to ye Ireland seis lyis.xliii.
Ilis, of quhilkis sum ar.xxx. mylis lang, vtheris.xii. mylis, vtheris mair and
vtheris les. Their Ilis were callit be sum auctouris Ebonie, and be vtheris ar
callit Hebredes. The principal I Will is the I Will of Man, quhilk lyis fornens
Galloway and was sum time the principal seit of the preistis namit Driades, as
Cornelius Tacitus, Caesar in his co^mentaris, and money other Roman auctouris
testifyis. North fra the I Will of Man lyis Arane vthirwayis namit Botha. This
secound name was geuin to it be sanct Brandane. For he biggit sum time ane house
in it namit Both. Fra Arrane lyis He law and ^othesay namit fra the first Scot
yat brocht the Scottis out of Ireland in Albioun. Nocht far fra their Ilis is
Ailsay, quhair siclik plente of so^and g^^s is, as we schew before in the Bas.
Fra Ailsay lyis money vthir Ilis de^idi^ and seuerit be their awin names full of
mynis sik as Irne, tyn, leid, and (...) metallis. it the may notable I Will of
Scotland is Ila, quhilk lyis beou^^ the tongue of Lorne in the sycht of
Lochquhabir, ane rich cuntre xxx mylis of lenth, rycht plentuus of corn and
full of metallis, gif their were. any crafty and industrius people to win the
samyn. Nocht far fra Ila lyis Cumbra and Mula als mekill as Ila both in lenth
and breid. In this I Will of Mula is ane cleir fontane two mylis fra ye see. Fra
this fontane discendis ane litil burn, or strip rynnand full of rounis to ye
seis, their rounis ar round and quhit schynand like perle full of thik humor.
And within two houris eftir that they come to see they grow in great cocles.
Schort gait fra their Ilis is Iona othirwayis namyt Colmekill, in quhilk is ane
abbay full of deuot religius men. This abbay was the co^moun sepulture of all
Scottis kyngis fra the time of king Fergus the secound, to ye time of king
Malcolme Ca^more, quhilk biggit the abbay of Dunfermling, quhair the may part
of our kyngis lyis sen the fundatioun thairof. Passand forthwart to the
northnorwest seis, Fornens Ros is ane I Will namit Lews.lx. mylis of lenth. In yis
I Will is bot ane reueir. It is said gif any woman waid throw this watter at the
spring of the eir, their sall na salmond be seen for that eir in the said
watter. Otherwayis it sall abound in great plente. Beound the Lewis lyis two
Ilis namit Sky and Rona. In this last I Will is incredible noumer of selch, pellok
and meirswyne, na thing astonist for the sycht of men. The last and out may
I Will is namit Hirtha, quhare the eleuatioun of the pole is.lxiii. greis. And sen
the eleuatioun of the pole above the I Will of Man is.lvii. greis, Ilkgre
extending to.lxii. mylis and ane half in distance, as Ptolome and vthir
astronimeris nowmeris. I conclude that fra the I Will of Man the first I Will of
Albion, to Hirtha the last I Will thairof, ar three hundred.lxxvii. mylis. This
last I Will is namit Hirtha, quhilk in Irsche is callit ane scheip. For in these
I Will is great nowmer of scheip, ylk ane gretar than any gait buk with hornis lang
and thykkar than any horn of ane Bewgyll, and hes lang talis hyng and down to
the erd. This I Will is circulit on every side with roche craggis and na baitis
may land at it bot allanerly at ane place, in quhilk is ane strait and narow
entres. Sumtyme their mycht na pepyll pas to this I Will but extreme dangeir of
yair lyuis. And it their is na passage to it bot quhen the seis ar cawnie but
any tempest. In the month of Iuny ane priest cumis out of ye Lewis in ane bait
to this I Will, and ministeris the sacrament of baptism to all ye barnis that hes
been borne in the eir before. Als sone as this priest hes done his office with
certane messis, he ressauis the tyndis of all their co^moditeis, and returnis
hame the same gait he come. In the I Will of Lewis ar.ii. kirkis ane dedicat to
sanct Peter, and the the other dedicat to sanct Clement. The fame is, als sone as
the fire gangis forth in this I Will, the man (that is haldyn of may clean and
innocent life) layis ane wosp of stra on the alter. And quhen the pepyll ar
geuyn may deuotly to their praers, the wosp kyndellis in ane bleis. Beound
their Ilis is it ane vthir I Will, bot it is not inhabit with any pepyll. In i^ ar
certane beistis nocht far different fra the figure of scheip, sa wyld that they
can nocht be taken but girnis, the hair of thaym is lang and tattie, nothir like
the woll of scheip nor gait. Betuix their Ilis is oftymes richt dangerus
passage, for the sea be contrarius stremes makis collision, sum times ettand
out the tyd, and sum times swelleand and soukand it in agane, with sa forcy
violence, y^* quhe^ y^ schippis ar saland throw their dangerus veylis, oftymes
they ar other drownit or ellis brokin on craggis. The gretest vele heirof is
namit Corbrek. For it will other synk or ellis draw ane schip to it, howbeit it
be distant their fra ane mile.

Of the nature of claik geis, and of the syndry manner of their procreation. And
of the I Will of Thule. Capitulo. xiiii.
HEstis now to speik of the geis generit of the sea namit clakis. Sum men
beleuis that their clakis growis on treis be the nebbis. Bot their opinioun is
vane. And because the nature and procreatioun of their clakis is strange, we have
maid na little lauboure and deligence to search ye treuth and verite yairof, we
have salit throw ye seis quhare their clakis ar bred, and fyndes be great
experience, yt the nature of the seis is mair releuant ^aus of their
procreatioun than any vthir thing. And howbeit their geis ar bred money syndry
wayis, they ar bred ay allanerly be nature of the seis. For all treis that are
cassin in the seis be process of time apperis first worm etin, and in the small
boris and hollis thairof growis small wormis. First they schaw their heid and
feit, and last of all they schaw their plumis and wyngis. Finaly quhen they ar
cumyn to the just mesure and quantite of geis, they fle in the air, as other
fowlis dois, as was notably prouyn in the eir of god ane thousand.iiii.
hundred.lxxxx. in sicht of money pepyll beside the castle of Petslego ane great
tree was brocht be alluuion and flux of the sea to land. This wonderful tree was
brocht to the lard of the ground, quhilk sone after gart deuyde it be ane saw.
Apperit than ane multitude of wormis thrawing thaym self out of syndry hollis
and boris of this tree. Sum of thaym war rude as they war bot new schapin. Sum
had batth heid, feit, and wyngis, bot they had na fedderis. Sum of thaym war
perfect schapin fowlis. At last the pepyll hauand ylk day this tree in mair
admiration, brocht it to the kirk of sanct Androis bes^de the town of Tire,
quhare it remanis it to our dayis. And within two eris after hapnit sic ane lyk
tree to cum in ye firth of Tay beside Dunde worm ^tin and hollit full of oung
geis in the samyn manner. Siclike in the port of Leith beside Edinburgh within
few eris after hapnit sic ane like cais, Ane sch^^ ^amit the Cristofir (after
that scho had lyin.iii. eris at ane ankir in ane of th^r Ilis) was brocht to
leith. And because her tymmer (as apperit) faileit, scho was brokin down.
Incontinent appe^it (as before) all the inwart partis of her worm etin, and all
the hollis thairof full of geis, on the samyn manner as we have schawin. Attoure
gif any man wald allege be vane ar^ument, that this Cristofer was maid of sic
treis, as grew allanerly in the Ilis, and that all the ru^is and treis that
growis in the said Ilis, ar of that nature to be fynaly be nature of the seis
resoluit in geis. We preif the cuntre thairof be an^ notable example schawin
before our ene. Master Alexander Galloway person of Kynkell was with ws in their
Ilis, geuand his mind with may ernist besynes to search the verite of their
obscure and mysty dowtis. And be adventure liftit up ane see tangle hyng and
full of mussill schellis fra the rute to the branchis. Sone after he opnit ane
of their mussyll schellis, bot than he was mair astonist than before. For he saw
na fische in it bot ane perfect schapin foul small and great ay efferyng to the
quantite of the schell. This clerk knawin ws richt desirus of sic uncouth
thingis, come haistely with the said tangle, and opnit it to ws with all
circumstance before rehersit. Be their and money other reasonis and examplis we
can not belief, yt their clakis ar producit be any nature of treis or rutis
thairof, bot allanerly be ye nature of the Oiceane see, quhilk is ye cause and
production of money wonderful thingis. And because ye rude and ignorant pepyl saw
oftymes ye frutis yt fell of ye treis (quhilkis stude neir ye see) co^uertit
within schort time i^ geis, yai beleuit yt yir geis grew upon ye treis hinga^d
be yair nebbis siclik as appillis and vthir frutis hingis be yair stalkis, bot
their opinioun is nocht to be sustenit. For als sone as their appillis or frutis
fallis of the (...) in the sea ^lude, they grow first worm (...). And be
schort process of time ar al ^eta^ in geis. Now we have schawin sufficiently
yneuch of the Ilis of Scotland gyf we had schawin ane thing, that is to say,
nocht allanerlie was ye. I Will of Thule with all the remanent Ilis of Scotland
seen be ws, bot als ^er sen^ be money Roman auctouris. ^or Cornelius Tac^tus
sayis the Roman navy (quhilk was send about the Ilis ^e command of Julius
Agricola) saw yis I Will of Thule, with the remanent Ilis ^^ande yair about. An^
you^h^ Ptolom^ writtis that the I Will of Thule ly^s amane the Ilis of Scotland.
it his wr^ting be prouin experienc^ may have na faith. For Thule is money mylis
distant fra Schetland, for Schetland (...) beound Orknay approe^hand t^
Noroway. Sum auctoutis sayis that T^ule is the samyn* I Will that w^ call Island.
For their auctouris sayts that Thul^ is the ^ast I Will of ye occeane see. And sa
is Island, quhilk lyis in the cauld and frosty seis beound the ^^rkill artik to
the north pole. The people of Island (because na cornis grow^^ in it) leif^is
allanerlie of fische. They bray dry fische als small as meil, and b^ikis thaym
with watter at the fire. And vsis it in manner of breid.

The discriptioun of Orknay, Schetland with sindry vthir small Ilis. And of
the maneris and conditionis of the people thairof. Ca. xv.
BEound all the Ilis of scotland lyis Orknay, sum part to y^ northnorwest seis,
and sum part to ye Almane seis. The principal I Will of Orknay is Pomonia ye
bischoppis sent in quhilk ar two strong castellis. In Orknay growis na quheit.
And it is nakit of wod. All other comis growis in i^ with great plente. Orknay
hes na vennomus beistis, more than Ireland. Na beist ennyme to the nature of
man may le^^ in Orknay. And sen we are now fallyn in speking of Ireland, howbeit
it pertenis na thing to the purpos we tuke on hand, we will schaw ane wonder
thairof quhilk passis all wonderis that eui^ we red before in any other bukis.
In Ireland is ane loch, and about the famyn be money mylis growis nothit her^e
^or tree. And gyf any ^re be affixit and ^et down in this loch, within the space
of ^ne eir eftir, this ^re alteris. For sa mekle of it as is hyd within the erd
tu^^is in ane hard stane, it y^ is hyd in the watter turnis in Irne. And sa
mekle as is abo^e the watter kepis the nature of the tree. And so the tree,
stane, and ^r^e ar ^unyt togidder under ane st^k. Bot we will return to Orknay
to schaw l^^ill* les wonderis of it. And first howbeit the pepill be g^uin to
excessive drinkin and be plente of b^ir makis the stark^st ail of Albioun, ^it
nane of thaym a^ seen wod, daft, or dru^kin. Als they (...) and feir in their
bod^is to extreme ^ge but o^y use of (...) with strange and fai^ bodyis. The
(...) of this cuntre hes ^y two (...), or (...) three ata^is, and of wyld foull
and tame is mai^ fou^h in Orknay, than in (...) part of Albioun. Their horse ar
li^ill mair, than asynis. Bot they may endure mair labor, than any other horse.
To speik of fische, their is mair (...) thairof th^n any uncouth p^ple may
belief. In Orknay is ane great fische mair than any horse of meruellus and
incredible sleip. This fische (quhen scho beginnis to sleip) ^e^^is hi^ ^eith
fast on ane crag above the (...). Als sone as the marineris fyndis hi^ ^n
sleip, they cui^ with ^ne stark cabill in ^ne boit. And eftir that tha^ have
borit ane great hole throw her tale, they fes^e her be the samyn. Als sone as
^is fi^cheis awalknit, scho makis her to ^^ip with great force in ye see. And
fra scho find her self fast, scho wrythis her out of her awin skin, and deis.
Of the fatnes that scho hes, is maid duly in great quantite. And of her skyn
(because it in du^is lang) is maid strong cabellis. Ane hundredth skylis beound
Orknay ^is Scherland, of q^hilk the riches standis only in fische dryit be
son. Many hydis and skynnis of oxin, scheip, ^ait, and ma^trikis dryit with the
son ^^mys out of this cuntre, in Scotland, and on the same manner, the
marchandis of Holland, eland, and Almanie, ^umys ei^lie to Schetland, to
interchange other marchandyis with the p^ple ^hairo^^ quhilkis ar of the same
nature and conditionis as the people is of Orknay. B^^ound schetland ar money
Ilis quhilkis le^ffis on the same manner a^ it dois. And youcht ye people of yi^
Ilis be pure, it they leif langer and ar better content of their lyuis, tha^
they that hes mair wealth and riches of the world. N^ contentioun is amang thaym
for singular proffet. Ilk man prouidis for sa mekle fische in ye symer as may
sustene his house agane the winter. Their people ar nakit of all ambitioun and
vice, and neuir trublit with uncouth wer^s. Amang all pleseiris ((...) ar iosit
be mankind) they think na thing sa good, as to leif in concor^ and peace, hauand
ane quiet life but any vthir displeseir. Yis perfection of life cumys to thaym
only throw their symplicite, And followis be the samyn y^ fu^steppis of crist.
Ilk eir anis cumys to thaym ane preis^ out of Orknay, and ministris to thaym
the sacrament of baptism. And eftir that he hai^ do^e his deuore, he ressauis
his teyndis Justly and returnis the samyn gait he come to Orknay. Forthir gif
any giftis of nature may be noumerit aman^ wardly guddis* I say their Ilis hes
may feliciteis and guddis than any vthi^ cuntreis. For the people thairof ar
fair, lusty, and strong of body, dotat with money giftis of nature, and hes good
h^ill of body, quhilk may be preferrit to all riches, as we^l knawis their men
that (...) experience of lang infirmiteis. For their gy^ the people be m^ist
rich that standis sa content with their awin gudd^s, that they covet na
vtheris* I say yi^ people ar als happy as any vthir people of the world. Fo^^hir
gyf (...) wa^d say their thingis that I writ ar vane, considrin I was neuir i^
yir Ilis. I say I was weil informit of yame be ane noble man Edward sum tyme^
^^shop of Orknay. For to this bischop come ane man out of their Ilis, and ^^cht
alt^nerlie schew their thingis with al^ circumstance before rehersit, Bot (...)
thaym be him self. For he passit the commoun stature of men, and sa wycht that
na man durst contend nor wers^^ with him. And he was (...) of visage and hyde,
than was any lady of the world. Be their reasonis appe^is, that the auctorite of
they auctouris is na worth, that sayis all people (...) the son a^ harbor and
miserable. For their is na happiar creaturis in the world than their people of
their landis forsaid. Amang the ^ochis and craggis of their Ilis growis ane manner
of electuar and goum, he wit like gold, and sa attractiue of nature, that it
drawis stra, flox* or hemmis of claithis to it. On the samyn manner as dois ane
Adamont stane. This goume is generat of see froith, quhilk is cassin up be
continewal repercussion of craggis aganis the sea wallis. And throw Ithand
motioun of the sea it growis als teuch as glue ay mair and mair, quhill at last
it fa^^s down of the crag in the sea. It is said be thaym that hes experience
thairof, that this goum (quhen it lyis on the crag) is like ane froith and blob
of watter. Because it is nocht than sufficiently wrocht be motioun of the sea.
Oftymes the sea tangle is found inuoluit with yis goume. Because it is doung
heir and their sa money wayis be alluuion of watter, and sa lang as it fletis,
it is sone inuoluit with any thing that it metis. Two eir before the cumin of
this buke to lycht arriuit ane great lomp of this gou^ in Buchquhane, als mekle
as ane horse. And was brocht hame be the hirdis (quhilkis were kepand their
beistis) to their housis, and cassin in the fire. And because they fand ane
smelland adour thairwith, they schew to their master, that it was ganand for
the sens that is said in the kirkis. Their master was ane rud man as they were,
and tuke bot ane litill part thairof. And left the remanent behynd him as matter
of litill effect. All the partis of this goum (quhen it was brokin) was of the
hew of gold. and schane ^^ke the lycht of ane candyli. The may part of this
goum and electuare was ^is^royit be rud people, before it come to any wise mannis
eris. Of quhome man be verifyit the proves. The sow cutis na balm. Als sone
as I was aduertist thairof. I maid sic deligence, that ane part of it was
brocht to me at Abirdene. Their ar the may notable thingis that we culd find
concerning the I^is of Albioun, Orknay, and Schetland. Thus it were neidf^ll to
put ane end to our cosmographie, were nocht ane uncouth and wounderfull history
taris a lityll our pen. Master James Ogilby with vthir noble men was send as
ambassatouris fra the may noble prince king James the feird to the king of
France. And be tempest of see, they were constranit to land in Norroway, quhare
they saw nocht far fra thaim money wild men nakit and roth on the same manner as
they ar payntit. And at last they gat aduertising be landwart people, that they
were doum beistis under the figure of men, in time of nycht yai vsit to cum in
great cumpanyis to landwar^ villagis. And quhair they find na doggis, they brek
up durris, and slayis all the people that they find their intyll. Als sone as
they heir ye noys of doggis they euanis, and dar nocht abide. They ar of sa
huge strenth, that sum times they pull up treis be the r^tis. And fechtis
thairwith amang thaym self. The ambassatouris were astonist be their monstouris
and maid stark waches with great fyris birnand all nycht. And on the morrow they
pullit up salis and departit. Forthir their Norroway men schew to the said
ambassatouris, yat yair was nocht far fra thaym ane people, that swomit all the
symer like fische in the sea, leiffand ay on fische. And in the winter (because
the watter is called) they leif of wyld beistis, that discendis fra the montanis.
And sum time bringis yir bestis hame to thayr couis. And sa endis heir ye
cosmographie and discriptioun of Scotland.

Ane prudent doctrine maid be the auctoure concerning both the new maneris
and the auld of Scottis. Capitulo xvi.
Because sindry nobill men hes desyrit me to schaw ye auld maneris of scottis
(quhilkis ar skatterit in sindry partis of yis buke) under ane co^pendius
treit, that it may be knawin how far we in their present dayis ar different fra
the maneris and leiffing of our auld fad^ris. And youcht I know na thing
bettar, bot the schawing thairof will draw me in hattent of sindry great
personagis. For few ar that may suffir their vices to be taxit, or thaym self
to be repreuit. it because I stand sum part under the reverence of their nobill
men forsaid, I have condiscendit (as I may) to their desiris. For they allege
it will be proffitable to the rederis, specially to sik men, that are nocht
geuyn ouir immoderatlie to their awin affectioun. No^ it ouir mekill sopit in
sensual pleseir. For sik men may be reducit fra their errouris. And thairfore
I intend first to schaw quhat maneris hes been amang our eldaris both in time
of weir and peace. And be quhat ingyne, wisdom, and cheuelrie they have
debatit aganis sa money strong ennymes. Howbeit their ennymes come oftymes in
this realm with may dangerus i^cursionis. And finalie we will schaw how the
notable strenth, vigor, and souerane virtew faileit ay the mair amang thaym,
that they declinit fra ye temperance of yair (...) is, quhill at last it is
cumin to their dayis, in quhilkis we leif in great tranqui^lite. Howbeit the
samyn is mair be benevolence and sleuth of our nychtbou^^s, than any manly
prowis of our self. Now will I schaw the schortest way I may, how we in their
present dayis ar drounit in all manner of avarice and lust. it I belief that sic
men (as at of severe life, following ye temperance of yair eldaris) sall reiose
to heir the honorable maneris of their eldaris. Utheris (that are of mair
brutall and vicius life, seeing their vices taxit with sik dish^nour) sall dres
thaym plesandlie to reuert fra their evil and schamefull dedis to better life.
First I suppone that the thing that I say in repreuing the corruppit maneris of
the world now present, be nocht takin in repreif of every man. Bot allanerlie
to sik men that leiffis with intemperance. For sik men deseruis mair repreif
than I may gif thaym at this time. And gif any man fyndis his byle opnit for
purgatioun be me, that he hyde nocht his infirmite, bot erar seik ye best
rameid he may to amend his life. Our eldaris howbeit they were rycht virtewis
both in weir and peace) were may exercit with temperance. For it is the
fontane of all virtew. They were of temperat sleip, meit and drink, and sic
refectionis as were preparit with litill laubour or cost. Yai^ breid was maid of
sic stuf, as grew may ^salie on the ground, their vitallis were nocht ^iftit
(as we do now) to make thaym delicius to the mouth. Bot were all ground togidder
under ane form. ^e flesche may frequent amang yame was other wild flesche
won on the fellis be their hunting, quhilk maid thaym of incredible strenth. Or
ellis it was of their awin tame bestial, specially b^if, as we do it in our
dayis. Howbeit we are rycht far different fra the use and custom of all vthir
nationis. The steirkis (quhen they ar bot oung velis) ar other slane, or ellis
libbit to be oxin, to manure the land, bot ye quiokis war (...), quhill they
were with calfe, for than they ar fattest and may delicius to the mouth. The
common meit of our eldaris was fische nocht for ye plente of it, bot erar
because their landis lay oftymes waist throw continewal exercition of cheuelry,
and for yat cause they leiffit may of fische. They disiunit ^^rly in the
morning with small refectioun, and sustenit their lyffis thairwith, quhil the
time of sowper, throw quhilk their stomok was neuir surfetly chargit to
empesche thaym of vthir besines. At the sowper they war mair large, Howbeit
they had bot ane course. Quhen they kest thaym self to be merry, they vsit may
aqua vite nocht maid of costly spicis, bot of sic natural herbis as grew in
their awin ardis. The common drink that they vsit was ayll. And in time of weir
(quhen they lay in their tentis) they vsit nocht bot watter. Ilk man had als
mekyll mele as mycht suffice him for the day, and maid breid yairof at the
fire, on the samyn manner as the romany did, specialy Antonius Caratallus
empriour, they had sendyll flesche in yair campis, bot gif it war won be pray
of ennymes. They eit for common flesche half raw, for the saup is may
nurisand in that manner. Attoure they had ay with thaym ane great vessel wrocht
full of butter, cheis, mele, milk, and vinac^e temperit togidder, be quhilk
they saiffit their liffis money dayis fra exstreme hungar soukand the ius and
humouris thairof, quhen na vittallis throw incursionis of ennymes mycht be
found. And howbeit they had peace with yair ennymes, they sufferit nocht their
bodyis to be corruppit with sleuth, bot were exercit other in continewall
hunting for in that game was great honor amang our eldaris* or ellis they had
exercition of rynnyng. Sum times fra the planes to the montanis, and fra the
montanis to the planis. Or ellis they war exercit in wirslyng or vthir
corporal exercition. They had their hedis ay cowit, as the Spaneartis vsis but
any bonet or cover les* tha^ they war trublit with infirmite. Nane of yame
throw ythand cowing of their hedis grew beld. They eid commonly bairfu^it, and
gif they had any schone, they dippit thaym first in the watter or they put
thaym on, specialy in winter quhen may schill and persand storms apperit,
that their sollis (quhilkis war hardyn with the hetis of the semer and snawis
of winter) should be the mair abyl to sustene laubour. Their abuleme^t was not
maid be motion of insolence, bot erar after the general gise of the cu^tre.
Their hois war maid of small lynt or wol, and eid neuir above their kne, to make
thaym the mair waldyn and sowpyll. The mantyllis that they vsit in winter was
maid of gros woll, and in semer was maid of small and fynest woll that they
mycht get. They slepit on benkis or bonchis of stra but any cover, and lernit
their sonnis fra their first eris to eschew eis and to sleip on the samyn
manner. Ilk mother was nurice to her awin barn. It was ane suspicion of adultre
aganis any woman quhare her milk faileit* the women thocht yair barnis wa^ not
tender nor kyndly to thaym, bot gif they war nurist als weill with the mylk of
their breist, as they war nurist before with the blude of their wambe. A^toure
they held that their barnis war degenerat fra their nature and kind, gif they
war nurist with uncouth mylk. They war sa accustomit* with ythand pyne and
laubouris* that they curit nothir the fervent heytes of the semer, nor it the
schyl frostis in ye winter. They trauelit may on yair fute. And in the time
of weir they had their carlagis and vittallis turst with thaym on their horse.
And quhen dangeir occurrit, they refusit na manner of besines nor laubour that
micht pertene to forsy campionis* gif it hapnit yam be mischance to be vincust,
they fled with sic speed to the montanis, that na horse men micht ouirtak thaym.
The iniure done to any ane of thaym was repute sa common to thaym al, yt they
wald neuir euoid ye displeseir yairof out of their hertis, quhill the samyn war
recompansit with the blude of their ennymes. He that was may noble desyrit
erest to fecht in the wangard, quhare his vassalage and manheid mycht be may
knawin. The nobyllis and commonis contendit, quhay should be may faithful to
other. And quhen the capitane throw his fers spreit and hardynes apperit in any
extreme dangeir of ennymes, all the band that was of his opinion ruschit sa
fersly to his defense, that other they delyuerit him out of ye present dangeir,
or ellis all atanis lois their lives with him. The sepulturis of all nobyllis
war decorit with als money hie stanis rising about the same, as he had slane
before of ennymes in his life. He that was found in the army but flint and
furisine. Or but his swerd beltit fast to his sidis, was schamefully scurgit.
And he that sald his swerd or laid it to wed, was degradit of auctorite, and
banist as unworthy creature out of their cumpany. He that fled in time of
battall, or departit fra the army without command of the capitane, was slane
but any dowme, quhare euir he mycht be apprehendit. Bot his gudis war geuyn to
his son. The women war of lytyl les vassalage and strenth, than was the men.
For all rank madynnis and (...) (gif they war nocht with child) ei^ als weill to
battall, as the men. Als sone as the army was passand forthwart, they slew the
first leuand beist that they fand. And nocht allanerly baithit their swerdis
with the blude thairof, bot taistit the samyn with their mouth, with na les
religion and faith, than they had been than sicker of sum felicite following*
gif they saw their awin blude in battall, they grew nocht astonist, bot boldin
in may bryme fury set thaym to revenge the samyn* in all battallis assaileit
be thaym, they socht neuir victory be treason, falset, nor slicht. And thocht
ay degrading to their nobilite to vincus their ennymes with any other thing,
bot force of fechtyng. They held it for great febylnes to revenge any
displeseir, hatrent, or slauchter be treason. attour sencerite and sympilnes
was equaly honorit amang thaym all* quhen they war to pas on their ennymes, ylk
man eid (as we do now) upon his awin cost, Except sa money as war wagit. He that
was trublit with ye falling evil, or fallyn daft or wod. Or hauand sic
infirmite as succedis be heritage fra the fader to the son, was geldit, that
his infeckit blude should spreid na forthir. The women that was fallyn lipper or
had any other infection of blude was banist fra the cumpany of men. And gif
scho co^sauit barn under sic infirmite, both scho and her barn war buryit
qu^k. All dronkattis, glutonis, and consumers of vitttallis mair than was
necessar to the sustentation of men were taken. And first commandit to swelly
their fouth of quhat drink they plesit, and incontinent thairefter was drownit
in ane fresche reuer. Forthir (howbeit they had na administratioun of Justice
in time of weir) it sic Justice was mynyste^d in time of peace, that oftymes
they war ouir severe in yair puuition. For they knew weil fra ^hair pepyl were
drawin fra battal to peace, they ^ul^ be geuyn to sa money enormyteis, that the
samyn mycht nocht be dantit but great punition* For the pepyll war of sic
nature. als sone as they knew thaym self gylty of any offense committit aganis
the kingis majesty, or commoun weill, they set thaym to raise diuisioun amang
the great princis of the realm. Nochtheles quhe^ they ar tretit with soft and
moderat empire, they ar found richt humane and meke pepyl, richt obeysand to
reason. And nocht allanerly kepis their faith after the reason of their
contract. Bot geuys ane gowpin, or ellis sum thingis mair above the just mesure
that they sell. This consuetude is sa straightly kepit, that gif the samyn be
nocht done, the biar will nocht stand to the contract of merchandice. They vsit
the rytis and maneris of Egiptianis fra quhome they tuk their first beginning.
In all their secret besines they vsit not to writ with common letteris vsit
amang other pepil, bot era^ with sifars and figuris of beistis maid in manner of
letteris, sic as their epithafis and superscriptioun above their sepulturis
schawis. Nochtheles this crafty manner of writing (be quhat sleuth I can not
say) is perist. And it they have certane letteris propir amang thaym self,
quhilkis war sum time vulgar and commoun. Forthir they that spekis with the
auld tongue of that cuntre hes their asperatioun, their diptongis and their
pronunciation better tha^ any other pepyl. The commonis ar nocht exercit
thairwith, bot allane^ly they that dwellis in the hie partis of the land. And
because their men hes their langage mair eloquent and propir, than the commonis
hes, they ar callit poetis, and makis poetis effering to their eruditioun and
science, with money great cerimonyis, beside money traftis and science (quhilkis
they have translatit in yair awin tongue) they profes may the science of
medcinary, and ar richt excellent in it. For they know the nature of every
he^be that growis in they cuntreis. And curis all manner of ma^edyis thairwith,
Heirfore I say their is na region in the world sa barrant nor unfruitfully be
distance fra the Sun, Bot be providence of god, all manner of necessaryis to
ye sustentatioun of man may be gottin plesandly in it, gif their war si^ pepyll
that cu^d laubour it effering to the nature thairof. Nochtheles as our e^datis
(quhilkis dwelt continewally merchand with the realm of Ingland) lernit the
saxonis ^oung be frequent ieoperd^is and chance of battall sustenit money eris
aganis thaym. Sa the pepyll now present in scotland hes tynt ba^th the langage

virtew and temperance of our eldaris began to be of lytyl estimation amang ws,
tha^ we war geuyn after the arrogance and pride of Inglismen to vane glore and
ambution of honouris. And began ye time to seek new names of nobilite. Howbeit
before they dayis he was may nobyl, that was decorit mair with virtew than
riches, confiding mair in his awin dedis, than in any dedis of his eldaris.
Than began in Scotland the maneris of Dukis, Erlis, Lordis, and Baronis. For
before they dayis the principal men of Scotland under the king war callit
Thanis. That is to say gaddera^is of the kyngis malis. And war ay rewardit be
the king, as their faith and virtew deseruit. Bot now I belief nane hes sic
eloquence, nor fouth of langage, that can sufficiently declare how far we in
their present dayis, ar different fra the virtew and temperance of our eldaris.
For quhare our eldaris had sobriety, we have ebri^te, and dronkynnes. Quhare
they had plente with sufficence, we have immoderat cursis with superfluite. As
he war may noble and honest* that culd deuore and swelly may. And be
extreme deligence serchis sa money deligat cour^is, that they provoke the stomok
to ressaue mair, than it may sufficiently degest. Throw quhilk we ingorge and

occupation. And nocht allanerly may surfeit dennar and sowper suffice ws abo^e
the temperance of our eldaris. Bot als to continue our schamefull and
immoderyt voracite with duble dennaris and sow^ aris. Throw quhilk money of ws

this schamefull intemperance above the necessar sustentation of nature, we geif

appetit of glutonis* Nocht allanerly ar wynis socht in france, bot in Spain,
Italy, and Greece. And sum time both Aphrik and Asya socht for new delicius

all mane^ of droggis and electuaris (that may nuris the lust and insolence of

howbeit it be of good complexiou^ be nature, it is sa oppressed with superfl^w

their guddis are not sufficient to nuris yame in voluptuus life and pleseir of

Amen.

Follovvis ane compendius recapitulation of all kingis of Britane* sen the
first beginning thairof to the time of king Henry the.viii.
THe history of Scotland is sa implicat with the history of Ingland that it is
difficyll to know. And because the crown of Ingland hes been iosit with syndry
pepyll, be syndry chances and variance oftymes, I thocht expedient for
co^modite and pleseir of rederis to now mer their genelogy first fra Brutus. Be
quhom the Britonis war brocht out of Greece in this I Will of Albion Fra the
beginning of the world.iiii.M.xxvii. eris, and iosit ye crown of Britane be the
space of.i.M.i.C.xvi. eris. In quhilk time they war inuadit cruelly be Julius
Caesar and not only vincust, bot their realm maid tributar in form of province.
And howbeit their Britonis had kingis lang time namit of the Britonis blud. it
their realm was gouernit ay be Romany. To the eir of god.iiii.
hundredth.xxxvi. eris. And in that season they war subdewit to Scottis and
Pichtis. And nocht allanerly maid tributaris to thaym.xxx. eris, bot gaif ouir
mekyll of their landis to the empire of Scottis and Pychtis. As Paulus
Diaconus, Beda, Sabellicus. and money other recent authouris schawis at lenth in
yair historyis. Nochtheles their Britonis impacient to sustene ye empire of
ba^har pepyll (because they war accustomit before with Roman pleseiris) chesit
Constantine the son of Androenus duke of Bertane to be king, in hatrent of
scottis and pichtis. This Co^stantyne come with sic pissance and army in
Britane, yt he delyuerit ye Britonis of al servitude, and recouerit their
realm fra our redemption.iiii.C.lxv. eris. After Constantine rang Constantius
his son, and after Constantinus rang Uortigern ye space of xxii. eris. In the
mean time ye scottis and pichtis raise with sic army, yt they almaist subdewit
ye Britonis agane to servitude. Throw quhilk Uortigern was constranit to seek
support of Saxonis, and be yair weris resistit certane eris al invasion of
scottis and pichtis. Quhill at last he was taken be slicht of Hengist, and
brocht to extreme servitude and banist with all ye Britonis in Walis. Thus come
ye remanent boundis of Britane under ye empire of Hengist, and callit Hengist
land, and ye pepyl yairof Hengistis men. Bot now be corruption of langage the
realm is callit Ingland, and the pepyl Inglismen. Ye Britonis war not only
disparit be this ttubyl, bot money eris after faucht aganis Inglismen be king
Arthure with sindry chancis of fortoun. Bot after his deith yai war subdewit
agane, and content to be callit Inglismen under ane name with Saxonis. Fra ye
deith of king Arthure (quhilk was in ye eir of god.v.C.xlii. eris) to ye eir of
god.i.M.xvi. eris, Ye realm of Ingland was gidit be Inglismen ay vnd ye empire
of ane king. Bot sone after it was deuidit in.vii. syndry kingdoms, and brocht
agane to ye empire of ane king, under ye samyn marchis yt it hes now. And not
lang after it was subdewit and conquest be Danis, and.v. kingis of their (...)
continewally after other succeding. Of quhom the last was namit hardy Canute,
quhilk maid money proud lawis above Inglismen, and rang with sic tyranny, yt ye
Inglismen fynaly rebellit and slew al ye Danis within ye space of ane nicht.
Hardy canute inuadit on al sidis slew him self be disperation. The Inglismen
after his slauchter creat Edward ye son of king Eldrede yair king. For this
Eldrede rang above yame before ye cumyng of Danis. Nochtheles ye Inglismen after
ye slauchter of king Edward (quhilk was ^^it for his haly lif to ye nowmer of
sanctis) dred yt ye Danis should cu^ on yame with new battall, and thairfore
creat Herald yair king. For he was discendit both of ye lynnage of Inglismen
and Danis. Thus was Edward neuo to sanct Edward, and bruthir to sanct Margaret
ye haly queen of scotland, disherist of the crown of Ingland. This Herald geuyn
to rage and insolence of lust, maryit ye douchter of Willya^ bastard of
Normandy, and within few dayis after brocht her in Ingland. At last he tuk sic
hatrent aganis her and her blud yt he causit her to be schamfully defow lit
with rebaldis and lymmaris of his cuntre. Wyllya^ ye bastard and duk of
Normandy impatient to sustene this odius offense, come in Ingland with great
army, and depriuit king Herald both of his life and realm atanis. Ye eir of
god i.M.lxvi. eris. after ye first conques maid on yame be Danis.l. eris.
William ye bastard and co^creour of Ingland tuk ye crown after the slauchter of
king Herald, and causit ye Normanis and Inglismen to ^ncres togidd^^ vnd ane
blud but any memory of ye name of Danis. Ye posterite of this W^^^iam
perseueris it with great honor and victory to their dayis, tegnand abo^^
Inglismen at this time king Hary the.viii. quhilk for hi^ illuster and (...)
dedis salbe put in great renoun and memory be our posterite.

Heir endis the namis of the kyngis.
The translatoure sayis to his buke,
Thou marcyall buke pas to the nobyll prince
King James the fyft my souerane may preclare.
And gif sum time thou gettis audience
In humyll wise unto his grace declare
My walkrife nychtis and my lauboure sare
Quhilk Ithandly hes for his pleseir tak
Quhyll goldin Tytan with his birnand chare
Hes past all signis in the odiak.
Quhill besy Ceres with her pleuch and harrois
Hes filled her graingis full of every corn.
And stormy Chiron with his bow and arrois
Hes all the cloudis of the heuynnis schorne.
And schyll Triton with his wyndy horn
Ouir quhemlit all the flowand occean.
And Phoebus turnit under Capricorn
The samyn greis quhare I first began.
Sen thou art drawin sa compendius
Fra flowand latyne in to vulgar prose.
Schaw now quhat princis been may vicius
And quhay hes been of cheuelry the rose.
Quhay did their kingrik in may honor Iois.
And with their blud our liberteis hes coft
Regardyng nocht to de amang their fois.
Sa that they mycht in memory be brocht.
Schaw be quhat dangeir and difficill wayis
Our antecessouris at their vter mychtis
Hes brocht this realm with honor to our dayis
Ay fechtand for their liberteis and richtis
With Romany, Danis, Inglismen, and Pichtis
As curtas reders may throw thy process ken
Thairfore thou ganis for na catyue wichtis
Allanerly bot unto nobyll men.
And to si^ personis as couettis for to heir
The vaileand dedis of our progenitouris
And how this cuntre both in peace and weir
Been gouernit unto their present houris.
How forcy cheiftanis in money bl^dy stouris
(As now is blawin be my vulgar ^en)
May vaileandly wan landis and honouris
And for their virtew call^^ nobyll men.
For nobylnes sum time the loving is
That cumis be meritis of our eldaris gone
As Aristotyll writis in his rethorikis.
Amang nobillis quhay castin thaym repone
Mon dres their life and dedis one be one
To make thaym worthy to have memore
For honor to their prince or nation
To be in glore to their posterite.
Ane other kind their is of nobylnes
That cumis be infusion natural
And makis ane man sa full of gentylnes
Sa curtes, plesand, and sa lyberall
That every man dois him ane nobyll call.
The lion is sa nobyll (as men tellis)
He can not rage aganis the bestis small
Bot on thaym quhilkis his majesty rebellis.
The awful chu^le is of ane other strynd.
^houcht he be borne to vilest servitude
Their may na gentrice sink in to his mind
To help his friend or nichtbour with his good.
The bludy wolf is of the samyn stude.
He fetis great be^stis and ragis on the small.
And leiffis in slauchter tyranny end blud
But any mercy, quhare he may ouirthrall.
This man is born ane nobyl thou will say
And geuyn to sleuth and lust immoderat.
All that his eldaris wan he puttis away.
And fra their virtew is degenerat.
The more his eldaris fame is eleuat
The more their life to honor to approach
Their fame and loving ay interminat.
The more is ay unto his vice reproach
Amang the oist of grekis as we hard
Two knichtis war, Achylles and Tersete
That ane may vaileand, this other may coward.
Better is to be (sayis Iuuinall the poet)
Tersetis son hauand Achylles sprete
With manly force his purpos to f^lfyll,
Than to be lord of every land and street
And syne may cowart cumyn of Achill.
Man callit ay may nobyll creat^re
Because his life may reason dois assay
Ay sekand honor with his ^esy cure,
And is na noble quhen honor is away.
Thairfore he is may nobyll man thou say
Of all estatis, under reverence.
That vaileantly doith close the latter day
Of natyue cuntre deand in defense.
The glore of armis and of forcy dedis
(Quhen they ar worthy to be memoryall)
Na les be wit than manheid ay procedis,
As Plinius wrait in story natural.
Ane herd of hertis is more strong at all
Hauand ane lion aganis the houndis sour,
Than herd of lyonis arrayit in battall
Hauand ane heart to be their gouernoure.
Quhen fers Achilles was be Paris slane
Amang the Grekis began ane subtell plede
Quhay was may nobyll and prudent capitane
In to his place and armor to succeed.
Quhay couth thaym best in every dangeir led
And saif their honor as he did before.
The vaileant Ajax wan not for his manhede,
Quhen wise Ulisses bure away the glore.
Manhede but prudence is ane fury blind
And bringis ane man to schame and indegence.
Prudence but manhede cumis often behynd.
Howbeit it have na les intelligence
Of thingis to cum, than gone be sapience.
Thairfore quhen wit and manhede doith concur
Hie honor risis with magnificence
For glore to noblis is ane groundin spur.
Sen thou contenis mo vaileand men and wise
Than euir was red in any buke but dout.
Gif any churl or velane the dispyse
Bid hence him harlot, he is not of this rout.
For heir ar kingis and money nobillis stout
And nane of thaym pertenand to his clan.
Thou art so full of nobylnes per tout
I wald nane red the bot ane nobyll man.
Thus to all nobyllis sen thou art dedicat
Schaw briefly how be my great deligence
Ilk story be the self is seperat.
To make thaym bowsome to thine audience.
Schrink nocht thairfore, bot bide at thy sentence.
Sen thou art armit with invincible truth
Of gentle reders take beniuolence,
And cure of otheris na Inuy nor rewth.
Pas now to lycht with all thy sentence hie
Groundit but feid or assentatioun
In natural and moral Philosophy,
With money grave and prignant orisoun
Ma^d to the reders crud^tioun
Be the renowmit Hector Boethius.
Supportit often with Scoticronicon
To make thy matter more sententius.
Bring nobyll dedis of money eris gone
Als fresche and recent to our memory
A^ they war bot in to our dayis done
^^at nobyll men may have both laud and glory
For their excellent brut of victory
And it because my time hes been so schort
I thynk quhen I have oportunite
To ring their bell in to ane other sort.
Leir kingis to hait all people vitius
And na sic personis in their house ressaue.
And suffir na seruandis auaritius
Ouir scharp exactionis on their subditis craif.
That not be done without their honor saif
Sekand na conques be unlawful wanis.
Schaw money reasonis how na king mycht haif
His baronis hartis, and their geir atanis.
Schaw how the kingis life and governance
The murrour of leuyng to his people been.
For as he luffis, be his ordinance
The same maneris ar with his people seen.
And thairfore kingis hes na oppin rene
To use all pleseiris as thaym lykis best.
The hiear honor and office they sustene
Their vice is ay the hiear manifest.
Schaw now quhat kind of soundis musical
Is may semand to vaileand cheueleris.
As thondrand blast of trumpat bellicall
The spretis of men to hardy curage steris.
So syngyng, fydlyng, and piping not efferis
For men of honor nor of hye estate.
Because it spoutis sweet venom in their eris
And makis their myndis al effeminate.
Be money reasonis of great experience
Schaw how na thing in to this erd may be
So good so precius as ane virtuus prince.
Quhilk is so needful to this realm, that we
But him hes nocht bot deith and pouerte.
Schaw how na guard, nor armor may defend
Unhappy life and cursit tyranne
(Gyf they continue) but mischeuus end.
Persuade all kingis (gif they have any sycht
To lang empire or honor singular)
To conques favor and luf of every wicht
And every wrangis in their realm repare.
For quhen their subditis ar oppressit sare
And fyndis na Justice in their actionis.
Than risis nois and rumor populare
And drawis the noblis in sindry factionis.
Schaw quhat punition be reason of Justice
Efferis to they unhappy creaturis
That nurisis kingis in corruppit vice.
And schaw quhat truble, quhat vengeance, and iniuris
Contynewaly in to this realm enduris
Quhen men obscure and auaritius.
Hes of the king the gydyng in their curis
And makis the nobyllis to him odius.
Schaw how great baronis for their evil obeisance
Aganis their prince makand rebellyon
Deieckit been fra their hie governance
And brocht to final extermynion.
Schaw how na house of great dominion,
Na men of riches, nor excellent mycht,
May lang continue in this region.
Because the pepyll may not suffer hycht.
Schaw how of kirkis the superflew rent
Is ennyme to good religion
And makis preistis more sleuthfull than fervent
In pietuus werkis and devotion.
And not allanerly perdition
Of commoun weill be bullis sumptuus.
Bot to evil prelatis great occasion
To rage in lust and life may vicius.
Schaw how oung knychtis should be men of weir
With hardy sprete at every ieoperdie,
Like as their eldaris been sa money eir
Ay to defend their realm and liberte.
That they not be their sleuth and cowartre
The fame and honor of their eldaris tyne.
Apprise ylk stait in to their awin degree
Ay as they leif in moral discipline.
Schaw forth ylk king quhill thou come to the prince
That regnis now in great felicite,
Quhais anciant blud be hie preeminence

Than euir was geuyn to noble under heuyn.
Thocht thou pas forth (as bird implume) to lycht,
His gratius eris to my work implore.
Quhare he may se, as in ane murrour bricht
So notable storyis both of vice and glore,
Quhilk neuir was seen in to his tongue before.
Quhair throw he may be prudent gouernyng
Als weill his honor as his realm decore.
And be ane virtuus and ane noble king.
Finis,
Heir after followis the history and croniklis of Scotland compilit and newly
correckit be the reverend and noble clerk master Hector Boece channon of
Aberdene* Translatit laitly be master Iohne Bellenden Archedene of Murray,
channon of Ros. At the command of the richt hie, rich excellent, and noble
prince James the.v. of that name king of Scottis. And imprentit in Edinburgh be
Thomas Dauidson dwelling fornens the f^ere wynd.

Heir beginnis the first buke of the croniklis of Scotland,
How Gathelus our first pro genitour left the land of Greece, and come in
Egypt, and mary it Scota dochter to king Pharo, and of his cumyng to Spane.
Capitulo. Primo.
After the manner of other pepyl ye Scottis desyrand to schaw their beginning
richt anciant schawis them be this present history discendi^ of the Grekis
and Egiptianis. For as auld croniclis beris, their was ane Greik namyt Gathelus
son of Cec^o^s king of Athenes, otherwayis son of Argus king of Argiues.
Gathelus be his insolence maid money heirschippis in Macedone and Achaia /
quhilkis war certane landis of Greece. And because he couth not suffer ye
correctioun of freindis, he left his native cuntre of Greece and come in Egypt
with ane cumpany of siclik oung men fugitiuis as he was fra their cuntre. In
this time rang in Egypt Pharo the scurge of the pepyl of Israel: quhais son
follow and his faderis iniquite was drownit eftir with all his army in ye reid
seis be punitioun of god. Gathelus was the more plesandly resauit in Egypt that
he appecit be his cumpany to support king Pharo aganis ye moris and pepyll of
and, quhilkis be vnprouisit and haisty incursionis wastit all the landis and
townis of Egypt to Memphis the principal ciete of his realm, thus had Pharo
seen ane miserabyll rewyne of all his realm war nocht he changit the
governance of the empire of Epipt be industry of Moses, to quhome be command
of god the army of Pharo was co^mittit. Pharo be supple of Gathelus wan ane
may dangerus battall agane the moris, and brocht them to sa hie rewyne, that
he tuk their principal ciete callit Meroy. Gathelus ^ftir this happy victory
returnit in Egypt, and because he was ane lusty person strange of body, with
greit spreit, he conquest both the favor of ye king and his familiaris. This
plesand victory generit mair inuy tha^ glore to Moses. For the Egiptianis
hatit all the blud of Israel, and thairfore Moses knawing the hatrent of
Egyptiants persewyng him ylk day to the deith fled out (...) Egypt in Ynde to
saif his life. Gathelus for his victorius and vaileand dedis was maid general
lieutenand to all king Pharois army. And because he was ane lusty person,
semely, and of the blud riall of Greece, with prudent ingyne, he gat king
Pharois dochter namyt Scota in marriage, with part of they landis in heritage,
quhilk laitlie war taken be force of battall fra the pepyll of Israel. For their
causis ye Grekis began to reios, seand their capitane in sic familiarite with
the prince traistyng thairthrow sumtyme to have ane sicker dwelling place in
Egypt. Schort eris eftir Pharo deceissit, eftir quhome succedit to the croun of
Egypt his son Bochoris Pharo, quhilk oppressed the pepyll of Israel with mair
servitude and tyranny than did his fader, apperit thus na esperance of liberte
to the said pepill quhill Moses returnit forth of Ynd in Egypt to schaw the
command of god to this Bochoris Pharo for delyuering of the said pepyll out of
servitude, Eftir this Egypt was punist with uncouth plagis, because they held
the prophecy of Moses in de^isioun. Thus war the Egiptianis sa astonist, that
they inquirit their goddis of remeid. Be quhome was ansuerit, the present
plagis (quhilkis rang amang them for ye ^yme) war na thing in respect of the
terrible and grievous plagis quhilkis war appeirand to cum haistely on them.
Gathelus astonist be this respon^, and seand the pepyll presently tormentit
with sorrowful plagis* tuk ferme purpos to leif Egypt, and ^rar to assail the
chance of fortoun for sum vthir dwelling, tha^ to abide ye manifest vengeance
of goddis. And thairfore maid prouisioun of all thingis necessar to saling, and
come out of the mouth of Nyle with his wife, his frendis, and seruandis Grekis
and Egiptianis for feir of the said plagis, the eir fra the beginning of the
world.iii.M.vi.C.xliii. eftir mekyll wylsum travel be the seeis mediterane, he
arriuit in the land of Numide, quhare he was stoppit be the inhabitantis to
land. Eftir this he pullit up salis, and be lang and paneful travel he arriuit
in ane part of Spane callit tha^ Lusican, quhylk was eftir be his arryuyng
their callit Portyngall, that is to say the port of Gathele. Quhay may surely
affirm ane matter of sa greit antiquite? Gathelus sowpit be lang travel and
hauand na thing to refresche his cumpany landit his folkis to seik vittallis
and vthir necessaris to cumfort thayme eftir their weary labor. In the meyne
time ye inhabitantis of that regioun gaderit aganis him with arrayit battal,
nochttheles they war discumfist and put to flycht. Throw this vyctory Gathelus
and his folkis grew in esperance of good fortoun, traisting eftir sa lang and
wylsum travel to put end to their labouris and have ane stabyll and permanent
abydyng in the said regioun. Eftir this victory the inhabitantis maid ane band
of peace with Gathelus, and assygnit to him certane la^dis quhair he should have
his dwelling i^ times cuming. S^chort time eftir he bigg^t ane town upon the
reuair of Munde, quhylk was callit that time Brathare* bot now it is callit
Bersale. Nochttheles the inhabitantis dredand that their new pepyll of oncouth
blud should incres haistely in riches and strenth beside them was penitent of
the contract be them maid. And thairfor be assistance of their nychbouris
arrayit them in battall aganis Gathelus. and first send certane armit men to
interrup their biggynnis, syne maid them ^elf reddy to cum in the staill.
Gathelus weill aduertist that this battle mouit aganis him micht suffer na
delay, arrayit his folkis to meit his ennymes, exhortyng them to do vaileantly
for their liuis and honor and to have sicker esperance of victory sen the
battle was to be led be them (quhylkis war victorius) aganis their vincust
ennymes quh^lkis had na exercition nor knawlaige of cheualry. The inhabitantis
seand their strangearis cum in batell with mychty curage and spreit in ane
oncouth cuntray, dred gyf they war vincust in the said battle, they should be
brocht to perpetual seruytude. And thairfor desirit Gathelus to ane co^monyng.
In the quhilk they gaif to him be new appointment certane landis in the north
part of Spane callit now Galicia. For they had in prophecy ane strange pepyll
should cum sumtyme to dwell in they boundis, and co^mandit him to pas with his
pepyll in the said partis quhylkis should be brukit be him but any impedimentis
in times cumyng. And promyttit (gif any pepyll hapnit to invade him) to assist
to his support.

How Gathelus beildit the ciete of Brygance and namit all his pepyll Scottis.
How he send his two sonnis in Ireland. And of his decels. Ca. ii.
THe band roborat in manner foresaid, Gathelus maid sacrifice (as the use was in
they dayis) to his goddis. Syne past to the north partis of Spane, and their
with amite confiderit with the inhabitantis thairof beildit ane town callit
Compostella. Quhair he resident in princely dignite maid lawis to cause his
subdittis to lif togidder i^ justice. After this he callit all his pepyll
Sco^tis for affectioun that he had to his wife callit Scota, on quhome he gat
two sonnis Hiber and Hemecus. The Spaneartis na thing reiosyng of the brudy
spreding of Scottis dred the samyn sumtyme to rise to their displesour. Thus
tuke they ferme purpos to bring the Scottis to vter distructio^. Gathelus
knawyng weil their ordinance, brocht forth his pepyl arrayit in battle. Than
followit ane richt dangerus and doutsum battle, Bot at last the vyctory
succedi^ to Scottis. nane of their parteis war glaid of the chance that fell be
this battle. For the may forcy and vailea^t capitanis war slane on athir
side. Thus war they co^stranit on ilk side to seik peace, quhilk was fynalie
tre^tit under their co^ditionis. Both their pepyll i^ times cumyng sal ceis
their weris, and every ane of them sall life on their awin lawis, and reios ye
samyn landis but impedimentis, quhylk they possedit before this last battle but
any further persecutioun. Throw quhilk it hapnit ane certane of their pepyll be
process of time to be send after i^ Ireland. Sicker peace thus standing amang
the two pepyll, Gathelus sittand in his chiar of merbyll within his ciete of
Brygance gouernit his pepyll in justice* This chiar of merbyl had sic weird, yt
it maid every land (quhair it was found) native to Scottis, as their versis
schawis.

The Scottis sall bruke that realm, as natyue ground.
(Geif vveirdis fayll nocht) quhair euir this chiar is found.
THrow quhilk hapnit that the said chiar of merbyll was eftir brocht out of
Spane in Ireland, and out of Ireland i^ they partis of Albion, quhilkis were
callit after Scotland. In this chiar all kingis of Scotland war ay crownit,
quhil ye time of king Robert Bruise. In quhais time beside money other cruelteis
done be king Edward lang schankis the said chiar of merbyll was taikin be
Inglismen and brocht out of Scone to London and put in to Westmonistar quhare
it remanis to our dayis Gathelus s^and his pepyl incres in Bryga^ce with mair
multitude than mycht be sufficiently nurist, thocht mair expedient to bring his
pepil to sum other part, quhair they mycht be esely sustenit, than to violat
his ba^d of faith. And thairfore be counsal of prudent men he send
exploratouris to spy gif any landis war within the Occeane see, to quhilkis he
mycht bring ane part of his pepill. For the fame was fornens Spane to ye north
was ane I Will inhabit with rude pepill, hauand na lawis nor maneris. Sic thingis
knawing to Gathelus, he brocht all the schippis he mycht get to the nixt port,
i^ quhylkis he put both his sonnis Hiber and Hemecus, with marinaris w^^rmen
and other thingis ne^essare thairto. And co^mandit Hiber (as admyrall) to pas
to the said I Will, quhylk is now callit Irland. Their two sonnis of Gathelus
pullit up salis, and with fortunat wyndis arriuit the fifth day after in the
said I Will. And after that they had landit their folkis, they affixit their
tentis on ye nixt stre^this. The rude pepyl of this I Will astonist be cumyng of
their weirmen, fled with their bestial and guddis to their cau^^nis. Hiber after
his cumyng send certane armyt men to se quhat pepyll inhabit this I Will. The
weirmen (quhilkis war send for this effect) hapnit to cum upon the said pepyll,
fleand (as said is) with their guddis. And be adventure ane part of thaym slew,
and otheris brocht as prisoneris to their admyrall. Hiber knawing be syndry
signis the land plentuous, commandit (gif the pepil wald be plesandly subdewit,
that na forthir invasion be maid on thaym. The pepyl seand him merciful,
ca^drit their self and their guddis, and he ressauit thaym with sic
beniuolence, that he sufferit them to incres with his pepyl under ane name and
lawis, and left his brother to govern thaym be his autorite and Justice. Sic
thyngis done he maid sacrifice in the honor of his goddis to send felicite to
his pepyll. Syne returnit in Spane, leuand behind him ane strange garrison with
wiffis and barnis to inhabit this land, and to keip the same under obeisance of
his brother Hemecus. Hyber at his returnyng in Spane fand his fader Gathelus
deccissit. After quhais deith he was maid king, and began to eik the boundis of
his empire, and wan sindry townis fra the Spaneartis, hauand with him at all
tymis ane strange guard of men. Be quhais pissance and cheualry he dantit the
pepyll on sic manner, that he was haldyn in great estimatioun and reverence amang
the said pepyll. Thus war they constranit to seik his peace. After this last
band of peace ye Scottis grew in Spane, quhylk was namit than Hiberia fra Hiber
with sic amyte that both the pepyll grew under ane name and blude, with sic
tender and freindly benevolence y^ but any memoree of auld iniuris, ilk man set
him to defend his nichbour as his brothir or fader both in weir and peace. Of
this Hiber discendit be lang progressioun ane great posterite after him lynealy
succedi^g. Ama^g quhom were money nobyll and famous princis, as Metellius,
Hermoneus, Ptolomeus, Hibertus, and Simon Brek.

How Hemecus gouernit Irland. And how Simon Brekvves maid king after his
deith, Ca. iii.
QUhill sic things war done in Spane, Hemecus (quhilk was left as said is be
his brothir Hiber in Ireland) gouernit ye same in great felicite, and namit the
samin Hibernia fra Hiber, quhilk is callit in our langage Ireland. This I Will was
inhabit in they dayis be two pepill, the Scottis and the auld inhabitantis of
it, quhilkis war gottin (as sum auctouris sayis) be gyandis. Hemecus gouernyt
both their pepill in great Justice, hauand na les respect to the seissoun as the
time occurrit than to the maneris of the pepill under his obeisance, knawyng
weil nathyng mycht bring the pepill sonar under ane freindschip and band, yan
sic doyngis. And it he mycht neuir bring thaym to that effect. Schort time
eftir Hemecus deceissit. Eftir quhais death raise ane odious debait quha should be
governor, every natioun contendyng to have the lord of their awin blude.
Quhill at the last they creat two gouernouris. Betuix quhom raise continual
battall and slauchtir on athir side, throw ambitioun and byrnand desire to be
governor of the said I Will. After lang battallis their two pepyl brokyn with syndry
displesoures war co^stranyt to tak peace, howbeit the same schort time indurit,
ilk ane of thaym persewyng other with battal. And it they dwelt money eris
togiddir be interchange of weir and peace. Quhill at last y^ scottis brokyn ylk
day with mair iniuris send their a^bassatouris to Metellius, quhilk was ye time
regnand above the Scottis in Spane, desiryng be their lame^tabill regrait to
have support aganis ye auld inhabitantis of Ireland. And schawand thaym ane
wyld pepill impacient to suffir oncouth empire above them. Throw quhilk ye
scottis mycht have na tranquilite, without the said pepill were mair haistelie
dantit* the message of scotis was ye mair acceptabili to Metellius, yt it
concernit ye co^moun weil both of the scottis of Spane and Ireland, discending
be lang progression of a lynage and blud. King Metellius nocht refusit thayr
desyris, traistyng the samyn to succeid na les to the honor and glore of him
self, than to ye proffet of his freindis. And thairfore send his three sonnis
Hermoneus Ptolomeus and Hibert, with ane army of vaileant men in Ireland,
quhair they with richt dangerus battal vincust the auld inhabitantis of the
said I Will. Sic thyngis done in Ireland, Hermoneus the eldest brodir returnit in
Spane, leuand behynd him his two brethir Ptolomeus and Hibert quhilkis gouernit
the pepill of that la^d money eris eftir in great tranquillite and Justice. And
maid lawis efferyng to the ryte of they dayis, and instrukkit the preistis to
make sens and sacrifice to the goddis on ye same manner as the Egiptianis vsit.
Thus incressit the pepill money eris eftir in great felicite and riches. Bot as
the nature of men is, ouir greit prosperity engeneris evil maneris, and causis
men to wirk frequent displesoures on thaym self, quhe^ they find na ennimes to
inuaid thaym at hame. Their pepil eftir lang peace war deuidit in two opinionis
co^tendyng for the governance and administratioun of this realm. Their two
partis had all vterlie distroit other, war not they war reconseld togiddir be
ane nobill man namyt Thanaus, principal man under the king, quhilk was send
before as ambassatour to the said I Will, reiosyng of the felicite succedyng to his
frendis, to cause thaym be his prudent consultation to incres togidder under a
mind. This Thanaus be his honest behauyngis was hal^yn amang thaym of great
prudence, hauand bot newtrall affection to both the partyis, and persuadit
thaym at their conuentioun to remove all co^tentionis risyng amang thaym, and
to cheis ane (quho^ they thocht may expedient) to be their king, and be
obeysant to him in all their governance. For na thing micht be i^ erd sa good as
ane good king. Throw this persuasioun ye pepyll tuk sic fervent desire to have
ane king, that all iniuris beand reparit, they co^mandit Thanaus to ^heis him
king, quhom he thocht may expedient. Tha^ said Thanaus, I know our myndis sa
deuidit in syndry factionis, that na man (that is participant thairwith) may be
esaly our king. And senour myndis is to have ane newtral person to regne above
ow, their is now in Spane ane nobyll man of great seuerite and Justice namit
Simon Brek, weill accustomit with our lawis, and lynealy cumyng of Metellius our
ancient progenitour, quhais sonnis sumtyme nocht only supportit ow (quhan may
danger occurrit) bot gouernit ow money eris after in great tranquillite and
Justice, quhais posterite it remanis amang ow i^ may honouris. I think this
Simon may abyll to be our king. The partyis herand the name of Simon Brek war
glad to have him king, because ye name was haldyn richt fortunat in they dayis.
And but any lang tarry they send their ambassatouris in Spane to cause this Symo^
to cum in Ireland to ressaue the crown thairo^. Symo^ knawing be degest
auysement the intent of their ambassatouris prouydit ane flote of schippis, and
finaly be prosper windis arriuit in Ireland, quhair he was solemply ressauit*
and crownit in ye chiar of merbyll, quhilk was brocht out of Spane as may
rich iowell in they dayis. Simon was the first king that rang about the
Scottis in Ireland, fra the beginning of the world, iiii.M.v.C. and.iiii. eris,

Dowdale, quhair the said Thanaus dwelt after with the pepyll y^ he brocht with
him out of Brigance, the famous ciete of Spane. Their pepyll war callit
Brigandis, of quhome after be process of time discendit money nobyll and vaileant
men, quhilkis come after with Fergus ye first king of Scottis in Albioun. Be
quhome all they landis of Scotland (quhilkis ar now callit Galloway) was callit
Brygance, quhais inhabitantis war fundin ay full of manheid, and strangest
ennymes to Romany and Brytonis, as we fall after heir. This Simon gouernit
Ireland in good felicite, and deceissit the forty eir of his regne*

Of the great Posterite of Scottis regnand in Ireland after Simon Brek. Of the
first cumyng of Scottis and Pichtis in Albion, and how the Pichtis war alliat
with the Scottis. Ca. iiii.
Simon deceissit (as said is) his son Fanduf was maid king. After him
succedit Ethione. After Ethione succedit Glaucus. After Glaucus succedit
Nathasyll. After Nathasyll succedit Rothesay. This Rothesay was the first king
that send any Scottis in the Ilis of Albion. The first I Will that he inhabit he
callit it Rothesay fra his name. The remanent Ilis were callit Hebredes fra
Hiber the eldest son of Gathelus. This Rothesay herand the death of his fader
Nathasyll returnit in Ireland, quhair he be general vocis of the pepyll was
maid king. The eir that Scottis were brocht out of Ireland in Albion was fra ye
empire of Simon Brek in Ireland CC.xvi. eris. Fra the beginning of the world,
iiii.M.vi.C.xvii. eris. The scottis cumyng out of Ireland in this manner spread
i^ syndry Ilis of Albio^ lyand to ye great north thairof, and deuidit thaym i^
syndry tribis. The first I Will that they tuk possessyoun of (as the croniklis
schawis) was nami^ Ardgaell, fra Gathelus quhylk now be corruptioun of langaige
is callit Ardgile. The Scottis deuidit be this manner in syndry tribis chesit
certane capitanis to every tribe to govern thaym both i^ time of weir and
peace, hauand the name of their capitane in sic reverence, that quhasa euir
tuke the samyn in vane war na les punist than they had manesworne their goddis.
Attour that they maid invocation thairto (quhe^ may trubyll occurrit) as sum
divinity war in the samyn to preserve thaym fra all danger. This consuetude
perseuerit money eris after in the Ilis. Nocht lang after a banist pepyll namit
Pichtis come forth of Denmark to search ane dwelling place. And after yt they
war i^hibit to land both in France, Brytane and Ireland, they landit i^
Albion. Sum authouris sayis they come first i^ Orknay. and sone after in
Cathnes, Ros, Murray, Mernis, Angus, Fiffe, and Louthiane, and expellit all ye
pepyll, that inhabit that region before their cumyng. Their pepyll war callit
Pichtis, outhir for thayr semely personis, or ellis for the variant color of
their clethyng, or ellis they war namit Pychtis fra the Pychtis namit
Agathirsanis their anciant faderis. In probation heirof Orknay was callit the
auld realm of Pichtis. Siclike the seeis betuix Cathnes and Orknay war namit
Pentland fi^^h. And all the landis (quhilkis ar now callit Louthiane) war
callit tha^ Pe^tland. Sum authouris sayis their Pichtis were ye residew of Hunn^s
banist be Flemyngis, and come first in Britane to seik ane dwelling, quhair
they be sorrowful battall lost Humber their king, be Lot^yne and Camber sonnis
of Brutus, quhilk began ye empire of Britane. This opinion is pleasant, war
nocht ye dait of eris is descordant to ye history. For Brutus and his sonnis
war money eris before their cumyng in Albion, Of their Pichtis wrytis money auld
and recent authouris, to quhom applaudis Cornelius Tacitus in the life of the
Roman Agricola, quhare he namis ye Scottis cumyng of Spaneartis, and the
pichtis of Almanis. of quhat sum ever natioun they ben discendit, treuth is,
after their cumyng in Albion, they war ane civil pepyl, richt ingenious and
crafty both in weir and peace. Sone after their cumyng in Albion, quhilk was
fra the beginning of the world.iiii.M.viii.C.lxvii. eris, they creat ane king
to govern thaym in Justice, and began to maik policy in byggyng of munitionis,
townis, and castellis. And because they knew al pepyl but successioun abyll to
perische, they send their ambassatouris to ye Scottis desyring to have their
dochteris in marriage. And schew (thocht they war of oncouth blude) they should
nocht be vilependit, sen they with na les prudence tha^ manheid hes ouirset
incredibill dangeris both be see and land. And now laitly conquest throw
benevolence of the goddis richt plentuous landis with sic peace and
tranquillite, that nane other pepyll may clame thaym be reason. Confiding
surely (gif ye goddis support thaym) be their awin industry to be equal to any
their nychtbouris both in peace and weir. Forthir gif the Scottis co^discendit
to their honorabyll desyris, it mycht fall the two pepyl incres togidder sa
strange under ane blude, that they mycht ye better resyst the fury of ennymes,
quhen euir it hapnit thaym to be inuadit. This legatioun was vnplesand for the
first time to Scottis, think and unworthy to have any societe or marriage with
ane uncouth and banist pepyll. it be degest auisement they fand their co^moun
weil was nocht risyng to sic pyssance, yt they mycht resist ye Britonis,
quhilkis hatit thaym sen their first beginning. Heirfor to augment their
co^moun weill, and to maik thaym the more stra^g aganis ye Britonis, they were
profoundly resoluit to have aliance with ye Pichtis, and to gif their dochteris
in marriage under their condicionis, ylk ane of thaym sall reiose i^ time cumyng
al they landis quhilkis they reiosit before the marriage. And to concur
togidder with their hale pyssance, als often as they war inuadit be ennymes. He
that maid offense to any ane of thaym sall be reput as ennymy to thaym both,
and als often as the croun of Pichtis come in pley, the king to be chosyn of the
nerrest of the woma^nis blude. Their conditionis plesand in all sydis, the
scottis gaif their douchteris in marriage to the Pychtis.

How the Britonis be their quent slichtis dissoluit the band of alliance
betuix the scottis and Pichtis. Of the trubyll that fell thairthrovv. Ca. v.
THe Britonis tuk na lytyl suspitioun of this marriage, dredand gif their two
pepyll incressit togiddir under ane blude to be sa strange in schort time, that
nothir micht the said Britonis for the time present, nor their posterite be
sufficient to resyst the pyssance of their two pepyll. And thairfor tuke purpos
to distroy thaym both. And to invade thaym erar with fraudefull slychtis tha^
any force of battal. And to bring their purpos to effect, they deuysyt to ^ais
sic seditioun betuix their two pepyll, that ylkane of thaym sall invade other
with battall. And fra that ane war cleirly distroyit, this other brokyn with ye
same wetris micht be the more facyl pray to thaym, it to couir their slychtis
more secretly, they supersedit their intention for three eris, to auyse gif
process of time mycht gif any better occasioun to move battall. The same time be
affinite before contrackit, the Pichtis multiplyit with ane brudy successioun,
quhairthrow the two pepyl grew in equal benevolence, The Pichtis geuand their
industry to polecy and labor of their handis, and settand their ingyne to
beilde municiounis and townis for defense and agmentation of their co^moun
weil. The Scottis exerceyng thaym in craft of hunting, halkyng, and nurising of
their bestiall, haua^d na other riches bot it only that grew be their store,
and war daily clothit in haberione of maile with bow and arrowis in ythand
exercition, als reddy at all times to defend their lyuis, landis and liberteis,
as their ennymes war to inuaid thaym in set battal. In the menetyme the
Brytonis send their ambassatouris to ye Pichtis, hauand great wounder quhy they
preferrit ye Scottis to thaym, sen they war ane pepyl full of riches and glore.
Quhais famous cheualry was knawin in France, Almany, and other syndry regionis
be seeis and landis. hauand ane rich realm repleit of all mynis of metal,
sa plentuous of every frutis necessar to the use of man, yt they mycht do hie
pleseir to their nychtbouris als weill in weir as peace.

Be contrar the Scottis war ane ondantit pepyll, hauand rude and wyld maneris
but any humanite, co^fydyng mair in their fuliche audacite, than any proves or
vertew, and dwelling amang strait and barrant montanis, and reiosyng in na
thing sa mekyll as in murdir of men and beistis. Attour they had be prophecy,
that the Pichtis should be extermynat and vterly distroyit be Scottis without
they socht the more haisty remeid. For their causis desirit thaim to make ane new
band of confideracioun with Britonis, to that fine, ye Scottis may be outhir
expellit out of Albion, or ellis brocht to vter destruction. Be quhilkis
doingis they mycht have incredibill commodite, reiosyng both their realms but
any feir in times cumyng. And to gif thaym the more prouocatioun to attempt
this besynes, they promyttit to support thaym with men, money, and vitallis at
their pleseir. This message had the more credit, that the Pichtis had before ane
vehement suspitioun, that the brudy spredyng of Scottis should sumtyme fall to
hie damage of their posterite. Als nathing mycht have causyt thaym mair to
move battall aganis the Scottis, than the responsis of their goddis concurrand
to their awin suspicion. At last the Pichtis be lang consultatioun answerit,
they contrackit affinite with the Scottis mair of necessyte than any hartly
frendschyp, quhais corruppit maneris war richt vnplesand to thaym. Nochttheles
sic oportunite may cum be process of time, that they mycht have sufficient
occasyon to move weir aganis the Scottis as they desyrit. For na thing mycht be
sa acceptabyll to thaym as the amyte and fallowschip of Brytonis. Prouydyng
alwayis the said Britonis maid thaym sufficient help (quhen time requirit)
aganis the Scottis, Sic besynes done (as occurrit for that time) the
ambassatouris war dispeschit. Schort time eftir the Pichtis seikand oc^asyoun
to move battall aganis the Scottis, co^mandit be general edict na Scottis to be
found within any townis or la^dis of Pichtis after ane prefixit day under pane
of death. The Pichtis (after yt this day was ouir past) slew all Scottis that
war found within their townis, munitionis and roumes, as brekaris of their
lawis. The Scottis richt impatient to sustene sa hie iniuris, ceissit not
quhill they had slane als money of the Pichtis, as were before slane of Scottis.
Incontinent be haisty trubil risyng in this manner was sa lamentable murdir on
athir side, yt ylkane of them slew other at their recountering, regarding
nothir affinite, blude, time nor place,

How the Pichtis and Scottis maid their ordinance to invade other be battle.
How Ferquhard king of Irland send his son Fergus with ane army in support
of Scottis aganis the Pichtis, and how the said Fergus was maid king. Ca. vi.
IN this manner ye peace dissoluit, the Pichtis denuncit battall to Scottis.
After quhilk followit con^inual i^cursionis on athir side. Attour that every
thing should be done erar be consultatioun than be inmoderat hatrent, the Pichtis
prouidit al thingis necessar for battle, i^ quhat wise, and be quhat capitanis
it should be led. quhidder they should abide ye cumyng of their enymes, or invade
them within their awin rowmis. The same time the Scottis co^uenit in Argyle,
quhair the capitanes war deuidit in sindry opinionis concerning this battle.
Sum accusyng the tresonable slichtis of Pichtis desyrit to pas on them
haistely, as wrangus and manesworne pepyll, brekaris of their faith, quhais
iniure was sa importabyll, it micht suffer na delay. Otheris thocht expedient
(sen ye matter was wechty) to invade their ennymes with hyd slychtis and good
ordour. In the mean time raise up ane agit man, and said in this manner. I know
weill (my hartly frendis) this iniure of Pichtis is sa intollerabyll and odius,
that we should rusche haistely to harnes to revenge ye same* Nochttheles all
besynes been weill done, yt procedis be good auisement, and sen Ireaualis nocht
but strenth, know weill this battle (that e intend to move) sall be na les
aganis the Brytonis than pichtis. Howbeit e have nocht that craft of cheuelry
nor pissance to resist them both. For their causis I think na besines sa
profitable, as to send ambassatouris to our aunciant progenitouris of Ireland
to have their support in this may da^gerus cais. Forther sen pluralite of
capitanis (as often occurris) rasis seditioun, best is to chese ane ama^g ws to
have empire above the laif. Under quhais counsel we sall fecht for our lyuis
and liberteis aganis ane falls and manesworne pepyl, quhilk hes inuadit ws but
any occasyoun of iniuris. This last opinioun was may apprisit. The Scottis
sone after send their ambassatouris in Ireland, complenand ye wickit offense
done be Pichtis, and desiring support. Ferquhard (quhilk was that time king of
Scottis in Ireland) sore mouit for displesure done to his frendis the Scottis
in Albion, send his son Fergus, ane wise and vaileant prince to their
support, and to give them the more esperance of permanent and sonse weird, he
send with them the fatale chiar of marbyll. Fergus was the more plesandly
ressauit be the Scottis, yt their co^moun weil was approchand to hie da^gear be
ane may perellus battall. After his cumyng ane counsel was set in Argyle, in
the quhylk Fergus said in this wise. May vaileant pepyll e se ane cumpany of
nobyll men (as e desyrit) cumyng in this our regioun to resyst the fury of
ennymes. The faderis ar sa reuthfull to their chyldrin, that nane offense may
be done to their said childrin, bot the same returnis to their dishonor and
schame. We are dettit to ou as faderis to their chyldrin, schaw ou thairfor our
chyldrin as we sall schaw ws our faderis. Lat ane iniure be commoun to ws
both, sen we are coniunit togydder, in blud and amyte. That glore and honor
may redound to ws and proffyte unto ow. it ane thing been necessar to auyse
quhidder ye empire of ane or of money be mair proffitabill for our co^moun
weill. And quhilk of them e think may proffitabill, sall be plesand to ws,
sen we be favor and benevolence of goddis ar happily arriuit in our regioun.
And cumyng only for our syngulare weill and support. The counsel (after this
orison of Fergus) thocht pluralyte of capitanis vnproffitabill, and thairfor be
degest consultatioun condiscendit to be gouernit be empire of ane king, and
this king to have empire on them als weill in peace as in every trubyl
appering aganis their ennymes. Attour to remove all suspitioun of hatrent
(because ylk tribe desyryt ane king of their awin lynnage) they chesit Fergus
both for his nobyll blude and other his excellent virtuous to be their king.
Attour he was sa prouyn in manheid and justice, that na capitane of the tribis
mycht be comparit to him. Fergus chosyn king in this manner was crownit in the
fatale chiar of merbyl, quhilk he brocht with him be respons of goddis to
stabyll his realm in Albion. And was ye first king y^ rang above the Scottis

of Britonis was discouerit both to Scottis and Pichtis. And of the ori^on
maid be Fergus to the king of Pichtis, Ca, vii.
THe Scottis rysyng on this manner (as we have schawin) in Albioun, king Fergus
gave his hole mind and attendance to resyst the iniure of this battall mouit be
the Pichtis. And after that he had callit all the capitanis before him, he
co^mandit every ane of them to be reddy to pas with him with careage horse of
forty dayis vitallis. And because he knew na thing mair odius than seditioun
amang weirme^, he maid afald concord amang his pepyll. And co^mandit them to
be obeysant to their capitanis with sic ordour, that none of them waver fra
their fallois, i^ aue^ture they fall as pray to their ennymes. Sic thyngis done
he maid sacrifice in the honor of his goddis according to ye use that was in
they dayis, Praying the goddis to take vengeance of ye party that gaif first
occasyoun of battall aganis other. And to grant him sic felicite in his just
defense, ye victory may succeed to him but heavy damage of his pepyll. Quhill
the scottis war at their besynes, the Pichtis assemblit ane army with na litill
gareson of Brytonis concurrant to their support, apperit on athir side ane
wickit and unnatural bergane betuix two pepyl, freindis and cietezouris,
faderis and sonnis. The Pichtis come first in ye Scottis la^dis. Aganis quhome
with na les curage tha^ manheid went Fergus with anciant armis displayit in form
of baner. In quhilk was ane reid lyoun rampand in ane field of gold with
thunderand steir awfully dyngand his bak as is the gise of the gentle lyoun,
quhen he enforsis him to wrayth. Fergus was the first that bure their armis in
Albion. And after him they war ay the arms of all kyngis discendyng of his
lynnaige to our dayis. Quhyll the Scottis and Pichtis were ar^ayit in otheris
sycht, the army of Brytonis stude arrayit on dreich nocht far fra them
deuisand be quhat slychtis they micht distroy them both with ferme purpos,
Quhen the Scottis and Pichtis were ionit togidder, and the ta^e of them
discomfist, tha^ the party vyctorius should finaly be distroit be their f^esche
army. And quhen their two pepyll war distroyit be this slicht, ye Britonis mycht
reiose both their realms in Albion but any feir in times cumyng. This subtel
slicht was discouerit to Fergus be ane banist Briton. Throw quhilk it hapnit
that both ye armyis mouit na les be feir of ennymes than be their awin propir
damage supersedi^ battall certane dayis. In the meyne time king Fergus desyrit
ane co^monyng with the king of Pychtis upon hi^ materis concerning na les the
weill of Pychtis than of Scottis. The king of Pichtis refusit nocht the
co^monyng, and met king Fergus with ane few cumpany of his nobillis, the oistis
standing on ylk side arrayit. Than said Fergus in this manner. Oftymes rich
townis and pepyll contendyng for the su^eriorite hes brocht thaym self to (...)
rewyne, and their ennymes (...) hie co^moditeis. Quhilk thingis ^^ll nocht
faill to cum on ws, gif we happin to fecht this day. The occasion of battle
(quhylk e mouit first aganis ws) desyris nocht at this time to be discussit
lauchfull or iniust. Howbeit the Scottis hes sustenit of our pepyll importabyll
iniuris but any redres. it gif it be leful erar to schaw the verite than any
flurisand wourdis, the desire of kyngdowme and slicht of Britonis hes mouit ow
to battall. e wald neuir have inuadit ws our faderis, war nocht the Britonis
our commoun ennymes hes deuisyt the same be quent slichtis to both our
mischeiffis. And quhidder their thyngis be true or falls e may best discus.
Howbeit na reasone may perswaid me to belief any other bot this battall sal cum
(gif we co^tinew) to the irrecouerable damage of ws both. Gif we fecht, quha
doutis* b^t victory sall be vncertane. For we are of equal pissa^ce. Suppone we
be vicust (quhilk may nocht succeid but vndemus murdir of ow) than sall e be
ane facyll pray to our e^nymes, bryngand thaym to tryumphe and honor, and our
self to misire and servitude. Quhat thing may be more odius or more
detestabyll* than the sonnis to invade their faderis. We a^ faderis, e our
sonnis, our sonnis our nepotis. And quhidder we be vincus^ or victorious, e
sall defoull our self with may terribyll offense aganis the goddis. Heirfor
lat ws commoun of peace, as nychtbouris and freindis alliat togidder. And
consider quhat infinite damage this battall sall do to ws and quhat commodite
to our commoun ennymes. And gyf any iniure be done be scottis to our pepyll. It
sall be redressit be me, to that fine that we (quhilkis ar of ane proximite and
blude) may euade the quent slychtis deuisit be Brytonis to both our damage,
and invade our ennymes with ye samyn tressoun that they deuysit for ws. That
reason and Justice may seem mair pyssant amang ws, tha^ hatrent or inuy. For I
belief na other way is sa souir to stabyll our pepyll in this I Will of Albion.

Of syndry consultationis maid be Pichtis. And how they war recounseld with
the scottis. Ca. viii.
THe king of Pichtis a^swerit to their wordis of Fergus, that he mycht nocht be
his private autorite dissolve thi^gis done be publyk counsel of his nobyllis.
This battall that he mouit was decernit be publyk and nocht be private
counsel. Nochttheles he wald glaidly auyse with his nobillis, quhidder they
wald haif weir or peace, and sal conuene to the same place with their mind. Als
sone as both ye kyngis returnit to their tentis, the king of Pychtis rehersit
the wourdis of Fergus before his counsel and schew how the same day behuuit
thaym nocht only to have fochtin aganis ye Scottis, bot aganis the tressoun of
Britonis. And to verify his intent, he brocht certane britonis in testimonial
thairof. Attour the inoportune solicitation of Brytonis desyryng battal aganis
Scottis, maid the slycht more credibill to Pichtis. The Pichtis auysyng
vnprudently in this matter war deuidit in two opinionis. Sum allegit the amyte
of Scottis was to be refusit. For they have persewit the Pichtis with sa money
slauchteris reiffis, the same may nocht be dewly redressit. Heirfor all their
alliance, al their condicionis and peace aucht to be co^temnit. For sic thyngis
may nocht endure, quhare reif, iniure and hatrent ar more estemit, than faith,
reason and Justice, Otheris said the amyte of scottis was both honest and
necessare, because they did money pleseiris afor to Pichtis, and mouit na battall
quhil they war first iniurit. And sen the Britonis war common e^nymes both to
Scottis and Pichtis, force is to thaym to be reconseld or ellis to be
scha^fully dou^g out of Albio^. Attour the affinite and blude rysyng betuix
thaym should put end to their weris. sen na thing is more detestabyll to the
goddis, nor abhominabyl to mortal creaturis, tha^ they pepil to move battall
aganis other, quhilkis ar alliat under ane co^mixtioun of blude. Thairfor
apperit na thing sa good to Pychtis, as to have freindschyp of Scottis, les than
they purposit to rendir falset, hatrent and evil dedis, for faith, luf and good
thankis. After that money of the Pichtis war geuin to peace, ane of the Pichtis
ennemy to Scottis (because his brother was slane in this last battall) said on
this wise. How is this blind contentioun rysyng amang ow (may vaileant men?)
have e nocht sufficient experience of the falset and cruelte of scotti^? delight
e any forther to assail gif any band may be kepit with unfaithful pepyll,
full of fers ingyne and cruelte, borne to our vter mischief. Belief e the
respons of our goddis be vane. Should we nuris this pestile^cius vennome to the
fynall perdicioun both of ws and our realm. This bludy and tressonabyll
pepyll (gif our goddis schawis the verite) sall nocht fail to raise amang ws ane
flame that sall neuir be sloknit. To this wickit man answerit ane other Picht,
and said. e should nocht be mouit be the respons of goddis. For gif they be of
determit verite, they may nocht be eschewit. Gyf they be falls they should nocht
be dred. Heirfor all iniuris done be any slicht and tressoun of athir partus
should be remouit, and to saif our honestee, lat neuir our aith and band be
brokin in our defalt, because we have sufficient experience in our dayis, quhat
notabyll vengeance been takyn upon money nobyl and vaileant campionis, quhen
they had nocht their faith nor goddis in reverence. Lat ws return to the band
of scottis, sen ye same may nothir be dissoluit but offense of goddis, nor it
but incredibill scham^, sa that we may persevere in kyndnes but offense other
to ye inmortall goddis, or our tender freindis. Als nature the mother of every
thing constranis ws to luffe our faderis, for they luffe our barnis their
nepotis. It is nocht necessar thairfor to have any battal bot erar to luffe our
freindis, that we be nocht in derisioun to our ennymes. Als sone as their wordis
war said, the wyffis of Pychtis (quhilkis followit the army for luffe of their
husba^dis) fell on kneis with ruthful teris, praying their husbandis to violat
nocht thaym self with schamful slauchter of their faderis. It is better to ws
and our barnis (said they) to de any manner of deith, than to se our faderis and
husbandis slaand other with cruel wondis. The Pychtis mouit sum part be luffe
of their wiffis and barnis, sum part be reverence of their godis condiscendit
to have peace with the Scottis under their co^ditionis. Redres maid on ylk side,
the Brytonis (quhilkis were mouaris of this battall) sall be haldyn ennymes to
both the pepyl. All other chargis to be at the pleseir of the two kyngis,
quhidder they list to strength peace under the auld conditionis or new. And gyf
their conditionis war nocht sufficient to roborat the peace, with quhat other
conditionis the two princis thocht may ganand. Sone eftir ane day was set to
renew the peace. The Brytonis (quhilkis come i^ support of Pichtis) heirand
this concord returnit hame, dredand ye samyn to succeed to their little
proffet. On the day affixit the Scottis and Pichtis war agreit on al debatis,
after the tenor of ye auld band with their new conditionis. Ilk ane of their two
pepyl sal leif content of their awin rowmes, supportyng other als weill in
honor as in profit, quhen hie and difficil chargis occurris aganis their
ennymes. The iniuris done to any ane of thaym sal be reput commoun to thaym
both. And quhen it was necessar to thaym to fecht aganis their ennymes, both
the pepyll sall conuene togidder under ane mind and ordinance. The peace beand
roborat in this manner, bait^ the kyngis returnit hame.

How Coyll king of Britoni^ was slane and his army discomfist be scottis and
Pichtis. Ca. ix.
COyll king of Brytonis herand at ork the scottis and pichtis confyderat in
manner foresaid, was richt sorrowful, for he dred their two pepyl to incres sum
time to his hie displeseir. Astonist heirof and nocht knawing be quhat ingine
he micht distroy thaym both (for his slychtis before come to little effect) he
tuke ferme purpos to have experience. Gyf the scottis (quhome he held for ane
vagabound and banist pepyll, of uncouth blude, strange in murdir of bestis)
durst fecht aganis his pepyll full of glore and cheualry. it he supersedit this
matter for two eris, to se gif any proud insolence mycht gener new deuisyoun
amang thaym, quhairthrow he mycht find sum better occasioun to inuaid thaym be
battall. For he under stude na sickir tranquillite nor peace mycht be had amang
his pepyll during the fallowschip of scottis and pychtis under ane concord and
blude. Heirfor to raise sum occasioun of battal betuix their two pepyl he send
ane cumpany of Brytonis in few nowmer to invade the bordouris of pichtis with
frequent heirschippis. And quhen the same be reason of trewis was desyrit be
pichtis to be reparit, the Britonis schew thaym neuir accustumate with sic
corruppit de^is of thyft, and said the same was done be scottis allanerly. At
last ye ground of this slycht was so serchit and brocht to lycht, that ye same
was prouyn cleirly on ye brytonis. Throw quhilk the two confiderat pepyll tuke
syk hatrent aganis the said Brytonis, yt after incredibyll slauchter of their
pepyl, they inuadit their realm and brocht ane multitude of bestyall out of
the samyn. King Coyll impacient to suffer this outraige maid him to wirk that
thing be force of arms, quhilk he micht not do before be slycht of ingyne. And
assemblit sone after ane huge nowmer of pepil with great ordinance of battall,
and entrit at the west bordouris of Scotland, and affixit his tentis on the
river of Dune inuadyng the country with continual heirschyppis, fire and
slauchter. Fergus weill aduertist of their doingis, co^mandit the bestiall and
guddis to be dreuyn to ye mo^tanis, and with thaym co^mandit ye wiffis, barnis
and other febyll creatouris to pas to ye strenthis of ye said montanis to
eschew ye fury of ennymes. Sic thyngis done he co^mandit be general
proclamationis al fensabyl me^ to be reddy in thayr best auyse to resist their
e^nymes. Howbeit he desyrit na thing mair than to prolong the battal, yt be
lang tarry and penurite of vittallis his ennymes mycht be weary and irkit. In the
mean time ane Scot tresonabilly fled to king Coyll, and discouerit to him every
thing deuysit be king Fergus. Incontinent king Coyll send.v. M. Britonis to
take the said pray of bestyall fra the montanis, and that he mycht be vntraist
suddante the more cruelte exerce, he maid his army reddy to invade the scottis
on ye nixt morrow. Sic thyngis schawin to Scottis and Pychtis be their
scurriouris apperit na little affray in their army. Than Fergus tuke
consultatioun of his nobillis quhat was best to be done. Money of thaym astonist
be multitude and curage of brytonis dissentit to battall. Utheris exhortit him
thairto, saying they war ane sufficient army, and determit to fecht for defense
of their wiffis, barnis, and lyberteis to the deith, sa that he wald assist to
thaym. Attour it was na les necessar than honorabyll to assail^e the chance of
battall. For victory is gottyn erar be manheid and prudence, than any multitude
of pepyll, After diverse opinionis it was concludit ye Fergus with his folkis at
the first vigill sall set on the wache of Brytonis. And ye king of Pichtis with
his folks sal pas ouir ye watter of Dune, quhare the army of Britonis lay, to
cu^ haistely on their bakkis, als sone as they heir the nois ryis be scottis.
Sic thyngis done with manheid and prudence to submit the resydew to the chance
of fortoun. The samyn ^aycht Fergus (as was deuisit) slew be great ieoperdy the
wache of Britonis, and nocht only braik their trinschis, bot enterit fersly
within their tentis, before king Coyll was aduert^st of his cumyng. Incontinent
raise ane terribyll clamor amang the britonis fast raschand to harnes to resist
this haisty effray, quhen suddanly the Pichtis come on their backis, suspekand
na thing les than sic irruptioun of ennymes. The Britonis nocht weill walkinit
of their sleip war inuadit on al sydis, and discomfist or they mycht cum to
array. Amang quhome king Coyll unwarily kepit be his nobillis, was slane. In
memory heirof ye place quhare he was slane was namit after Coyll, quhilk
regioun remanis it under ye same name or little different thairfra callit now
Kyle.

Of king Fergus oriso^ to his nobillis, and how the croun of Scotland was
tailet to him and his successouris, Ca. x.
After this victory the Scottis and Pichtis with displayit baner conuenit on
ane little mote. The resydew of Brytonis (quhilkis war eschapit fra this
battall be their ^eyng under nycht herand their king slane, and their army
discomfist) send ane herald to desire peace. The Scottis and Pichtis more
insolent after this vyctory than before rebutit the Britonis, and denyit peace.
Nochttheles the two kyngis (quhilkis knew weill the great pissance of britonis)
co^discendit to their peticionis. Quhen the pray and spule of this battall was
equaly deuydit amang ye two pepil efferyng to their manheid and prowes the two
kings returnit hame. Sone after Fergus co^uenit his nobillis i^ Argyle, and
said i^ this wise. e se (may vaileant ca^pionis) how e be special favor of
goddis hes vincust our ennymes and brocht our landis be wisdom and manheid to
sickir peace, and thocht e war vnequale both in nowmer and pissance, it the
goddis hes been sa propiciant, ye e have vincust the ennymes quhome e may
dred in this erd. e have put down our noysum ennyme with all his army, and ar
richit with their spule. They that contemnit ow before as febyll, banyst and
vnarmit pepyll, hes reuthfully desyrit our peace mair necessar than honest to
thaym. To be ane notabyl exampyll in tymis cumyng how vnsycker is to confyde in
any vane pissance of man. We know weill, how rich, how pissant ar the Brytonis
both be see and land, and the more rich they ar, the more schame redou^dis to
thaym, and the more glore to ws. Sen they at vincust be ws quhome they held
may vile and febyll. We have vsit our victory but any cruelteis. We have
vincust our Ire, to that fine that the goddis (quhilkis hes geuyn ws sa proud
victory) sall nocht find be our peruerst insolence any occasyon to bring ws sum
other time in derisioun of ennymes. Sen we nocht exercit our hattent on their
dyscomfist Brytonis, fleyng our fury be dirknes of nycht, bot sufferit thaym
to depart with our mercy and peace. Thus may we euydently se, that our wiffis,
barnis, liberteis and landis (quhilkis our ennymes intendit to have bereft ws)
ar saiffit allanerly be favor of goddis. Restis now to auyse be prudent
co^sultation how we may eschew all dangier apperyng in times cumyng. Quhylkis
thyngis sall succeed the better, Gyf we have the goddis in reverence, kepand
our band to Pychtis and Britonis as we promyttit, continewyng the realm in the
samyn governance, as e deuysit at our first cumyng. Prouydyng all wayis that we
remove seditioun scurrilite and auaricius leuyng with sic thyngis as may induce
hatrent amang ow. Forthir to maik ylk person leif on his awin, it war best to
part all the landis of this regioun be general consent. Swa that every ane of
ws content of his awin may have na occasioun to iniure his nychtbour, for sic
thyngis sall cause ws to incres in glore and honor to our freindis, and
dredour to our fayis. And wald god I mycht se ow (my deir pepyll) rysyng in sic
vertew before my deid, that I mycht with syckir esperance schaw to our eldaris
the weil apperyng to their posterite. Quhen Fergus had endit this orisoun, the
pepyll schew thaym reddy to fulfill his desire and neuir to be gouernit in
times cumyng bot be the empire of ane king, and nane to regne above thaym bot
king Fergus blude. And faileing thairof prayit ye goddis to send na les
vengeance on thaym and their posterite, than fell sumtyme on thaim in Egypt and
Spane for transgressioun of the command of goddis. King Fergus gat charter and
euydence of the crown of Scotland to him and his successouris in this sort.
Quhilkis charteris war grauyn in merbyll with ymagis of beistis in form of
letteris as was vsit in they dayis. Syne gaif the samin to may religious
preistis to be obseruit in their tempillis.

How king Fergus partit the landis of Scotland amang the nobyllis of his
realm. And of the maneris of brigandis. Ca. xi,
SChort time eft quhe^ the Scottis had refreschit thaym with huntyng and other
exercitionis, king Fergus co^uenit his nobyllis, and said in this manner. Now is
the time (may prudent faderis) sen our realm is stablit in good peace, to
part the landis of this realm (quhylk e reiose now but ordour) amang ow and
otheris that come with me out of Ireland in this regyoun. To do this more
plesandly ar to be chosyn.vii, newtrall men amang ws, quhilkis sall deuyde this
realm with sic reasone and prudence, that quhare the la^dis ar may ple^tuous
salbe geuyn ye les, and quhare ye samyn ar barrant, to be geuin the more. The
pepyl well applesit of this counsel chesit seuyn prudent men, quhilkis
co^siderit the boundis of Scotland, and deuydit the samyn with marchis equally
refering thairto. Their prudent men returnit the fourt month after to Argyle,
quhare king Fergus was resydent for ye time. In quhais presence all ye landis
of Scotland war cassin in cauyll amang the nobyllis thairof. Be the first
cauyll fell to Cornath capitane and his tribe, the landis of Cathnes lyand
fornens Orknay betuix Dummysbe and the watter of Thane. Secundly to capitane
Lutork, fell the landis betuix the watter of Thane and Nes callit now Ros. This
Lutork come with ane band of vaileant men out of Ireland with king Fergus in
Albion. This land of Ros lyis in breid fra Cromarte to the mouth of the watter
of Lochte. In this country was the famous castle of Urquhart, of quhilk the
rewinous wallis remanis it in great admiratioun of pepyll. Thridly to capitane
Warroch, fell the landis lyand betuix Spay and Nes fra ye almane to the Ireland
seis. The pepil of this land war callit Wares be name of their capitane. Bot
sone after they war sa sedicious that they war doung out of that country, and
the Murrayis brocht in their rowmis, be quhom ye landis war callit Murray land,
Be the nixt cauyl fell to capitane Thalis, the landis of Boyne, Ayne, Bogewall,
Gariot. Formartyne, and Bowquhan, Their landis war callit than under ane name
Thalia be name of their capitane. Be the nixt cauyl fell to capitane Martach
all the landis of Mar. Badeenoch, and Lochquhaber. Be the, vi. cauel fell to
capitane Noua^ce the landis of Lor^e and Kyntter with the hillis and montanis
thairof lyand fra Mar to the Ireland seis. Be ye vii. cauell fell to Atholus
the landis of Athole, for he was discendit of the scottis of Spane, and come
out of Spane in Ireland, and out of Ireland he come with Fergus in Scotland,
ane vaileant man and weill prouyn in fatis of armis. Be ye.viii. cavil fell to
Creones and Epidithis two capitanis of tribis the landis of Strabrawn and
Braidawane lyand west fra Dunkeld. Be the nynt cauyll fell to capitane
Argathelus the landis of Argile. His folkis war namit Argathelis fra Gathelus
their first progenitour. Bot now they ar callit men of Argyle. Be the.x. cauyl
fell to capitane Lolgonas the landis of Linnox and Clidisdail. Be the.xi. cauyll
fell to capitane Silurch the landis of Siluria, quhilk regioun is now deuydit
in Kyle Carrik and Cunynghame, quhais pepyl war rycht engenius and fers. Be
the.xii. cauyll fell to the brigandis the landis of Brigance now callit
Galloway. Their brygandis war ane vaileant pepyll and war deuysit thairfor to
dwell neir ye Britonis, to resist their incursionis gif any occurrit. Ane
certane of their brigandis was banist after for their seditio^is fechting,
quhilkis confiderat thaym with ane cumpany of Pichtis outrageous and wickit
lymmeris as they war, and inhabit they landis quhilkis ar now callit Annandale,
and put the Brytonis out of the same. Quhais posterite grew sa full of fury,
that they inuadit their nychtbouris with all manner of cruelteis. The women past
with their husbandis to battall, and fauche mair cruelly than did the men,
hauand na mercy, quhare they war vyctorius, they eschamit to be takyn in
battall and reiosit to de fechtand. Quhen they saw their freindis vexit with
lang and irrecouerabyll malideis (yt they sall nocht de in their bed) they slew
thaym be the swerd. This land of Annandale hes ane strait entres, and circulit
on every side outhir with seis, mossis, or synkand sandis. Throw quhais
difficill enteres hapnit yt the inhabitantis thairof dwelt in cauernis, leuand
on their incursionis and thyft, regardyng nouthir the empire of Scottis Pychtis
nor Britonis, and had continual wachis als weil be nicht as day. Als sone as
thai war aduertist of any i^uasouris, they drew thaym pertly to their wappinnis
on sic manner, that quha abstenit or cowartly absentit thaym (quhen sic chargis
occurrit) was after slane be their wiffis at their returnyng. They that
sufferit thaym self to be taikin as prisoneris war haldyn ay sklauis to their
wyffis, quhill they be sum honest wassalege recouerit their honor their wiffis
war commoun, the barn was haldyn his son to quhome he was may like in
vissage. Al other boundis of Scotland war than in the Pychtis handis. As the
Meirnis, Angus, Steremond, Gowry, Stratherne, Perth, Fiffe, Striueling,
Callender, Calderwod, Louthiane, Mers, Teuedale. With other the remanent
dailis, and the scherefdome of Berwik.

How king Fergus maid concord betuix the princis of Ireland. And how he
perist returnand be the Ireland seis Ca* xii
QUhen Fergus had deuidit the landis of scotland in this manner, and brocht the
same to sicker peace. He tuke ferme purpos to nuris his pepyll in good maneris,
and to do all thyngis the better he began at Justice. But quhylk na pepyll may
leif togidder, he maid sic lawis to punis theft and slauchter, that all the
bestiall and gudis of Scotland war saiffit in the feildis but any trubyll.
After this he beildit the castle of Berigone in Lochquhaber. This castle
standis in the west part of Scotland fornent the Ilis, quhare he exercit his
lawis to that fine, that his pepyl micht be drawin their the more esaly for
exercitioun of Justice. He past the remanent of his dayis in tranquillite and
peace with his nichtbouris. The Britonis and Pichtis, geuand his ingyne to cause
his pepyll incres togidder under ane benevolence and concord. Quhyll at last he
was chosyn ane Judge arbitrall to discus certane hie debatis falling amang his
freindis of Ireland. Sone after the said Fergus accumpanyit with ane certane of
his nobillis past in Ireland, and pacyfyit thaym of all deba^tis. This was the
last act he did. For after the agreance, this nobyll prince returnyng hame
throw the Ireland seis be ane wickit tempest was dreuyn upon ane crag, quhare
he perist with all his nobyllis the.xxv. ere of his regne. In quhais memory the
crag (quhare he perist) is namit it crag Fergus. In his time rang Esdaill king
of Britonis. And Cruthneus Cameloun king of Pychtis, quhylk byggyt after upon
the watter of Carron the ciete of Camelon ye princypall chymmes of Pichtis,
quhare sumtyme was ane good hauyn to ressaue schippis contrar ye winter storms,
thocht it be alterit now be necligence of pepyll, and turnit in ane medo. This
ciete of Camelon resistit money eris after to the Britonis and Romany. Quhyll
at last Kynneth king of Scottis (quhilk put the Pichtis out of Albion) brocht
it to vter subuersioun. This Cruthneus biggit the town and castle of Edinburgh
namit sumtyme the madyn castle. For all ye nobyl weme^ of Pichtis war nurist
within this castle in crafty labouris of their handis, quhil they war reddy to
mary. And sa endis heir the first buke of their croniklis. In the quhilk we have
seen how the Scottis first began, and how Fergus was the first king ye brocht
Justice and lawis amang thaym. Now we will schaw the residew of ye kyngis
succedyng after him in the same ordour as they rang.

Heir begynnis the secund buke of their croniklis of Scotland.
How the scottis after king Fergus deith contendit for the crown. And how it
was inhibit that oung childrin sall be kyngis. Ca. i.
FErgus on this manner perist, ane day was set be the counsel to cheis the king.
Quhen the day was cumyn, the nobillis war deuidit i^ syndry opinionis. For
Fergus had two sonnis of oung and tender age. Sum men thocht it was ane odius
thing both to god and man to defraude the ayris of king Fergus (they beand
pupillis) of their faderis heritage, puttyng his house to sic vter dishonor and
skaith. He doing in his time sa money nobyll actis for their commoun weill.
Otheris said oung barnis war vnabyll for any publik administration. For ane
king suid be ane prudent man, hauand wisdom and ma^heid both to resist ye
fury of his enymes, and to punis trespassouris be his auctorite and Justice.
Other wayis na pepyll mycht leif togidder. For the fame of ane nobyll prince is
ane great firmance to his realm. To this answerit Sembathis capitane of Argyle
in manner following. Nane is amang ow (good freindis) that is nocht mouit be money
reasonis to defend the barnis of Fergus, sen he be incredibyll luffe brocht to
ws i^ our extreme neid ane strange army, be quhilk he nocht allanerly delyuerit
ws of may dangerus battal, bot maid of our ennymes freindis, and of this land
ane realm, and decorit ws with honest lawis. Hes he nocht dantit the pissant
Britonis? ane pepyll full of riches and cheualry and put thaym both out of the
bou^dis of Scottis and Pichtis, geuand to ws sic institutionis that we may leif
(as otheris nichtbouris) but feir of ennymes, gif we have* na discentioun amang
our self. Quha sall thynk ws worthy to have kyndnes? gyf we defraude their
barnis of his just heritage? quhat displeseir sal we do to our ennymes? gif we
do sic importabyl schame to our prince. Lat Fergus goyst know ws good me^
luffaris of vertew and not vnmyndful of good dedis, with ye same mind (as he
left ws) to his posterite. Ressaue now his eldyst son to the crown, gif e
have any respect to our faith, gyf e had any favor to him during his life.
Other wayis e sall be odius to the immortal goddis and men. The pepyll war sum
part mouit be their wourdis. Than Frauchtaus chiftane of brygandis said in this
manner. I se ow (belouit freindis) contendyng heir, quhithir it be more
expedient to have Fergus ou^g son, vnabyl to regne for his minorite, or ane
other prudent man to be king, I thynk Sembathis mind should be louit, gyf na
thing bot kyndnes should be considerit in electioun of ane prince. Nane is that
misknawis amang ou how odius and detestabyll it is to defraude king Fergus
sonnis of their kyndly heritage. Na sic cruelteis (as I belief) is in our
myndis. Occurris nocht at this time to decerne gyf Fergus sonnis should
immediately succeid, bot only to se, how the crown may be kepit hale to their
perfyte aige. Quhat vengeance, skaith and damage sall fall on ws and our
commoun weill? Gif we (according to Se^bathis mind) suffer ane barn to be our
king. First sall rise amang ws ane byrnand occasion of hatrent. For their is
money amang ws equal to other in power and rentis. Attoure the empire and
governance of this realm during this oung kyngis mynorite sall be geuyn to ane
of ws. And he that gouernis the realm during ye kyngis mynorite sall be king
for the time, and honorit amang ws with auctorite reverence and every other
honoris that efferis to princely estait. Quhay is he that will nocht besely
contend for that honor? suppone ane of ws obtene this office, this man sall be
king for ye time and sal rich his awin house. And als often as any thing occurris
to be done for the common weill, as ambassatouris of great realmis to be
rewardit, or armyis to be send upon our fayis. This man that regnis during the
kyngis mynorite sall convert him only to our gudis. We sall be constranit to
gyf him our substance. We man nuris ane auaritius cumpany of lymmers about him,
nothir for the weil of the king, nor his realm. It is ane thing to have na
admiratioun, ane man is pleasant sa lang as he is private, howbeit he alter his
maneris, quhen he is clothit with publik auctorite. For good fortoun and good
maneris ar seildin grantit at anis to leuand creatouris. Finally quhen this
oung king is cumyn to age of, xiiii. eris and takis on him the governance of
the realm, he will be accumpanyit with suspicious pepyll, and maik him to
repair al wrangis done to his liegis within his tender aige. And do al sic
besynes as is requirit for the commoun weill. Howbeit he can do nathyng ye time
for laik of wisdom. Than quhen he hes may neid of wise counsalouris, he sal
suffir nane to be with him bot they only that will assist to his vice. Than sal
they corruppit rutouris his mynons, be salut as kyngis, and haldyn in reverence
amang ws. Nochtwithstandyng their insaciabyll avarice but schame. Quhay sall
have ye curage or spreit to punis thaym for feit of this insolent price?
forthir to behald ane ou^g prince regnand above any realm is siclike as quhay
wald se the commoun weill sweyand down. Than sall we have theiffis and
oppressouris takand our gudis both in burgh and land without punytioun, than
for laik of Justice sall be ythand slauchteris, the realm deuidit, the pepyll
but bridyl and governance, and may nocht leif in faith and Justice. Thairfore
said ye wise Solomon. Uengeance and sorrow sall the pepyll have that hes ane
ounge king. For their reasonis I thynk the barnis of Fergus should be geuyn to
wise preceptouris to learn lawis, good hauyngis and maneris, that they may be
abyll after to govern the realm. And as now the governance of the realm to
be geuyn to ^^rithais their eme, or to any other a^yll man quhome e thynk
expedi^nt, be quhais auctorite the crown sall remane reddy to be geuyn to thaym
at their parfite age. And als sone as the king deys, their barnis to succeed
immediately to the crown, gyf they be abyll thairfore, and during the kyngis life
they sall be honorit as immediate successouris to ye crown after the kingis
death. Be this way e may saif the barnis of Fergus vndefraudit of their kyndly
heritage. Gyf we desire to eschew ye sprout of sedicioun, with innomerabyll
inconuenientis after followyng. Gyf we desire both to defend our self, and
bring our commoun weil to proffet, this electioun of princis should be obseruit,
for it is conform to ye mind of Fergus, quhilk during his lyffe wald neuir
have socht any syngulare proffet in damage of our commoun weill. Quhen
Ferithais had endit this orisoun ye counsall assentit haill to his opinionis,
and be plane consent of parliament maid actis. Quhen it hapnit their king to
deceis, leuand behynd him oung children gottin of his body, the nerrest of the
kyngis blude and ablest to do Justice sall reiose the crown for his time. After
his deith the kyngis son sal succeid to the crown but pley gyf he war abyll
thairto. It was defendit be that samyn act that na barnis be kyngis. This
consuetude was kepit money eris after, throw quhylk raise mekyll troubyll in this
realm. For often tymis the fader brother regnand in ye minorite of his neuo kest
his extreme desynes to distroy him, Siclik the neuo to his fader brother for
ambitioun of the crown, throw quhilk occurrit continual slauchteris of kyngis
and nobyllis to the great trubyll of the realm, and damage of the commoun
weill^

Of king Ferithais, and of his deith. Ca. ii.
BE their actis before rehersit Ferithais brother to king Fergus was chosyn king.

This prince after his electioun maid ane orisoun to his nobyllis. The effect
thairof was yt he wald nocht ressaue the crown for riches, ambition, or
dignite, bot only to support his neuois, quhill ane of thaym war abyll to
succeid. And because he was left tutour testamenter be their fader, he wald leif
na thing undone that mycht auance the commoun weill other in weir or peace,
with na les affectioun to his neuois than they war his awin sonnis.

Syne he exhortit the nobyllis to make sic support and favor to his said
neuois that nocht he, bot they, should appear to govern the publyk weill. Hauand
in perpetual remembrance the honorabyll actis done be their nobyl fader king
Fergus. He desyrit als, grave and wise preceptouris to be chosyn to his said
neuois, yt they mycht incres als weill in vertew and science as i^ eris. but
any damage of ennymes. And fynaly declarit, he wald accept na publyk
governance on him, quhil their thyngis war first prouidit. Sic thingis done,
Ferithais was crownit in the fatal chiar of merbyll, and ressauit the kyngis
armis, in quhylkis was ane scherand sword with septoure crown and tressour in
manner of ane weirly trinsche for defense of his realm i^ lyberte and punition
of tra^sgressouris be Justice. Fra thens their war ay ye nobyll armis of
Scotland but any varyance, quhyll the time of king Achaus, quhylk maid the
first band of confideratioun betuix ws and France with Charllis the magne king
of France and Roman emperor. Be quhylk confyderatioun was eikit to the
tressour four goldyn lyllyis, with four goldyn crocis set i^ equale ordour
about the tressour, to sygnify the Scottis hes ay inuiolatly kepit the crystyn
faith but any spot of heresy, sen thai first tuke the same. Sone after ane
conuention was maid betuix ye two kyngis of Scottis and Pychtis, in the quhylk
war syndry vtilites deuysit for the weill of ye two realmis. New peace was
ratifyit, and punitioun maid on lymmaris and mouaris of sedition and trubyll
betuix the two realms, and redres maid on all sydis for obseruatioun of the
peace in times cumyng. Sic thyngis done, the two kyngis returnit hame. Sone
after Ferlegus eldest son to king Fergus be motioun of his familiaris and
otheris corruppit men (that mycht nocht suffer Justice) began to hate his eme
Ferithais, with purpos to distroy him. At last seand his wyckit purpos cum to
little effect, he gaderit ane cumpany of evil disposit men, and desyrit the
crown to be geuyn to him, as just heritour thairof. Ferithais dredand (gyf he
war repugnant to their desyris) to be cruelly inuadit, ansuerit, he should exoner
him glaidly of ye crown at ye nixt conuentioun on ye same manner as it was geuyn
to him. For he was neuir of purpos to beir auctorite langar than any of his
brother sonnis war abyll to succeed. And desyrit na thing sa mekyll as to se
ane of thaym reiose the empire, that he mycht schaw after his deid to Fergus ye
sycker weill apperyng to his post rite. And forther he desyrit his said neuo
to pas with him to the conuentioun, in the quhilk he should both exoner him of
al auctorite, and do every thing sa far as pertenit to ye weil of king Fergus
house. This plesand ansuer so mesit the mind of Ferlegus, that all hatrent for
that time beand amouit, they conuenit both togidder before the nobillis in
counsall, quhair king Ferithais said in this manner. I traist it be nocht
unknown to ow (wise faderis) quhe^ it was disput amang ow, be quhat wise this
realm mycht be gouernit in ye minorite of Fergus sonnis. e gaif me the crown,
(thocht I was unworthy) nocht only to govern it be Justice, bot that the same
should remane hale, quhyll the sonnis of Fergus war abyll to regne.

Quhat travel, quhat incredybyll danger have I sustenit both for our commoun
weill and felicite of this realm now rysyng in honouris, and sen na thing is
mair patent to ow tha^ sic besynes, I will omyt ye resydew thairof, that e may
have na occasyoun to deem me arrogant or desyrus of fenet glore. I war rycht
inhumane (sen I have na airis of my body) gyf I wald defraude my brother sonnis
of their kyndly heritage, or transfer the samyn in any uncouth blude. Ferlegus
my cousyng and just heritour to the crown clames the samyn fra me of good
reason, for he is oung lusty of hie engyne, of strange and lusty body to sustene
great chargis, and sall be every day more abyll to govern this realm. Be
contrar I am feblit be lang^^ge and desiris to be releuit of heavy (...). I
beseik ou thairfore that ye publyk administratioun (quhylk I ressauit be our
auctoryte) be geuyn to my cousyn, sen he is abyll and I vnganand thairfore. Na
thing may be sa plesand for me as to have ane private lyffe in times cummyng,
but any publict chargis. Ressaue ye auctorite with mair gladness than ever it
was geuyn to me. The counsall knawyng weill quhat irremidiabyl displesouris war
apperyng to their realm, gyf this oung and insolent prince Ferlegus war maid
king, co^tinewit Ferithais in his empire, and requirit him to sustene the
governance of the realm (as he did before) but any feir of his aige. Sen
realms ar gouernit mair be wisdom of aigit personis than any corporal
strenthe. The nobyllis wald nocht abrogat the lawis maid before aganis the
empire of oung chyldryn. and tuke great indignation that Ferlegus desyrit sic
thyngis as war repugnant to their commoun weill.

And thoucht they ressauit him in their counsal with reverence and honouris, it
they seuerit him fra the pepyll, repreuyng him quhy he eid fra the counsall of
the wise nobyllis his keparis, and desyring the crown without their advise, to
make it knawin, that he should obey the counsal of his wise lordis. Ferlegus
brokin on this wise fra his purpos, maid him with heavy cheir to depart fra ye
counsall. The nobyllis dredand syndry displeseris to follow be his departing
brocht him agane be force, and kest all his corruppit counsullouris in
preisoun. Amang quhom ane was that schew to ye king in quhat manner his deith
was deuisit, traisti^g be reuelatioun thairof to get his life saiffit. The
pepyll heirand this tressoun war sa co^mouit that they had slane Ferlegus, war
nocht the king pecifyit their Ire in time. And thocht the king was aduertist of
this tressoun deuysit in his slauchter, it to schaw him mair reuthfull than
rigorus prince, he kest his mind to meis the fury of the pepyll, and to keip
his neuo fra displeseir. Ferlegus was geuyn in new keipyng of the nobyllis. Bot
his seruitouris war punist to the deith. Ferithaes (als sone as this
conuentioun was skalit) raid throw his realm for equal administratioun of
Justice, quhyll at last he was slane within the nycht be his neuo Ferlegus three
monethis after ye first conspiration, the.xv. eir of his regne.

How Ferlegus was banist for the slauchter of king Ferithais, and of king
Maynus. Ca. iii.
FErithais slane (as we have now schawin) Ferlegus the murderar and all other
that war gylty of the said crime fled amang the Pychtis, and fyndyng their na
securite of his lyffe he fled in Brytane, quhare he consumed the residew of his
dayis in great misery. The nobillis after the slauchter of Ferithais conuenit to
the castle of Dounstafage in Argyle, for election of the king. Quhilk day the
counsall mouit of kyndnes to king Fergus chesit Maynus his ou^gest son
the.xxiiii. eir of his aige to be king. Maynus was ane nobyl prince richt
different fra his bruthir hauand all vicious men in great hatrent. He exercit
Justice equaly in his realm, and gaif commission to his liegis to conuene and
dres all debatis ama^g thaym self. The difficyll materis (quhen they occurrit)
was discussit be him self anis i^ ye eir, quhen he past throw his realm
halding his Justice ayris for redressyng of wrangis* and punitioun of
trespassouris. The same time Crynus king of Pychtis send ambassatouris to king
Maynus reiosyng of his felicite, and desyryng the band of peace maid before
betuix Scottis and Pychtis to be renewit. King Maynus weill i^struckit be his
nobillis (quhat was to be done) ressauit their ambassatouris, and condiscendit
to their petition. The peace ratefyit in this manner, the Scottis began to
burgeoun in sycker peace. King Maynus knawyng weill na pepyll may incres but
Justice, peace, and religioun, and seand realms and every thing in erd sa
subdewit to ye power of goddis, that na devise nor ingyne of man may auale bot
gyf the goddis stand propiciant thairto, quhais beniuolence been sicker guard
and protectioun to all pepyll. Thairfore to move his liegis to religioun, he
eikit certane new cerimonis to be maid in the honor of goddis, within their
tempyllis. And first he ordanit ane huge stane to be rasit on the south side of
the said tempyllis, on quhilk their sacrifice was maid. In memory heirof
remanis it in our dayis money huge stanis drawin togidder in form of circulis,
namit be the pepyll y^ anciant tempyllis of goddis. It is na little admiratioun
be quhat ingine and strenth sa huge stanes been brocht togidder. The sacrifice
vsit in they dayis, was ane portioun of cornis, cattellis, or any other frutis
yt grew upon the ground, quhilk was geuyn to kyrkmen for their sustentatioun,
and offerit to ye goddis quhen the samyn was super flew, or mair tha^ was
sufficient sustentatioun to the preistis. King Maynus foundat als ane sacrifice
to be maid monthly in the honor of Diane goddis of woddis and hu^taris, and
thairfore the pepyll maid their adoratioun to the new moan, quhilk
superstitioun was lang vsit amang our anciant faderis with money other va^e
cerymonyis after the ryte of Egiptianis. Quhen Maynus had gouernit his pepyl in
good Justice, and institute thaym with their and other superstitionis plesand to
the religioun of they dayis, He resygnit the crown to his son Doruidilla, and
deceissit the.xxix. eir of his regne. King Elgane regnand above the Brytonis,
and king Thaar above the Pychtis.

Of king Doruidilla. And of his constitutionis maneris and deith* Ca. iiii.
MAynus deceissit as we have writti^g, his son doruidilla was maid king. After
his coronatioun he renewit peace with his nichtbouris the Pychtis and Brytonis,
and schew him nurisar of tranquillite, detesting na thing mair than sic besynes
as gaif occasioun to battal, and delytit in every thing that mycht draw his
pepyl in peace. He tuke great delight of huntyng, rachis, and houndis, and maid
lawis that grew quhelpis should nocht line their moderis, for he fand by
experience hou^dis gottin in that manner vnproffitabyl (...) huntyng. He ordanit
als that yik nobyll should nuris two rachis and ane hound to his huntyng, and
quhen the houndis war maneit be adventure of chais, to be sustenit on the
co^moun good. He ordanit the slayar of ane wolf to have ane Ox to his reward.
Our eldaris persewit this beist with great hatrent for the great murdir of
beistis done be the samyn. The Scottis hauand na occasioun of civil nor of
uncouth weris set their ingyne to pre^ell all other pepyll in ye craft of
huntyng, and maid diverse lawis concerning the same. In the first commandit yt
quhais dog first bait the deir, should have the hyde thairof, quhais dog bait
nixt, should have the heid and the hornis. ye body curit to be at the pleseir of
the master of huntis, the resydew to be for the houndis. Gif any contention
raise amang the hu^taris to cheis ane Judge with all their consentis in the
tempyll of Diane to aggre thaym.

Their lawis war maid be general consent of the pepyl, to nuris thaym in
commoun pleseir, drawyng fra thaym all occasioun of iniuris and hatrent.
Quhylkis lawis war kepit money eris after. Their co^stitutionis and vtheris
deuysit before be king Fergus war colleckit togidder in tabillis, and geuyn in
keeping to the wysest and may profound clark for the time, to shaw both to
the Judge and to the person quhilkis war to be accusit the punition conform to
their demeritis, that the pepyll mycht understand the Judge past nocht fra his
boundis of Justice in punytioun of crimes. Attour the counsal wald conda^pne na
faltouris in they dayis, quhyll y^ lawis war first schawin according to the
falt. Throw quhylk it come in use that all criminabyll personis seand thaym be
just sentence co^dampnit to the deid, tuke the samyn in patience, gyf any
punytyon was maid on thaym above the lawis they murmurit as oppressed be the
Iugis. This manner of Justice remanis it amang the Ilis of Scotland, and may na
way be abrogat. For their been certane interpretouris of the lawis but quhom
they can gyf na richtwys judgment.

Quhen Doruidilla had roung xxviii. eris he deceissit at Berigone, and left
behynd him ane oung child namit Rewthar, quhilk micht nocht succeed for ye
lawis maid before aganis oung children.

Of the tyrane king Nathak, and of his slauchter. Ca. v.
After ye deith of Doruidilla, his brothir Nathak ane fair and lusty person
and abyll (as apperit) to publik administration was maid king. This prince rang
skarsly two eris, quhen he oppressed his pepyll with sic servitude that he was
haldin for ane myscheuous tyrane, he sufferit na lawis to be exercit, he
spuleit the co^mounis of their riches and gudis, and persewit his nobillis with
slauchteris and banissing. Their doyngis maid him odius to his liegis, and maid
his empire rycht vnsycker, and thocht he often times was counsallit be his
freindes to abstene fra sic enormyteis, he desislit nocht, bot grew ay the more
in vice that he incressit in eris, like ane bludy monstoure but schame and
mercy. it his cruel and unhappy dedis war nocht lang vnpunist. For Dowall
capitane of Brygandis (quhome he thocht before to have slane for his ouir greit
pissance) be assistance of money vthir nobyllis conspirit aganis him. And to
bring his purpos the sonar to effect, he maid Rewthar the son of king
Doruidilla to be their gouernoure, to that intentioun that gyf their hie
attemptatis succedit nocht with syk felycyte as he desyrit, the charge thairof
should allanerly redound to Rewthar. Dowal to find occasion that he micht bring
his purpos to effect, broucht this oung Rewthar with ane cumpany of armyt men
in the samyn place, quhare king Nathak remanit. And quhen he saw the matter
dressit (as he deuysit) to have occasyoun of debait, he gaif displesand wourdis
to king Nathak, saying he was ane falls tyrane but schame, and nocht only
spoyleit Rewthar of ye crown, bot rang with may cruel and odius tyranny
above the pepyll, and with hyd slychtis and tressoun hes slane ane great part of
all the nobyllis.

Nathak ansuerit agane in his wod fury, that he was king be ordour of Justice,
and should thairfore regne in times cumyng contrar the mind of Dowall and all
otheres of his opynyoun in sic manner, that the said Dowall sall never find him
mair fauorabyll nor gratius tha^ he was before, and declarit wtin few dayis he
sall punys him and al vtheris of his opynyoun in the scharpest sort that mycht
be deuysit for their attemptatis. Dowall mouit with their dispitfull wordis
ruschit forthwart with his complicis, and slew king Nathak with all the
nobyllis that war of his mind the secund eir of his regne

How Revvthar ane oung child was maid king contrar the lavvis. How Ferquhard
capitane of Lorne was chasit be Dovval in the Ilis, and of his orison maid to
the pepyll thairof. Ca. vi.
NAthak ye tyrane slane (as said is) Dowall maid ane conuentioun and be
assistence of syndry nobyllis to his opinion, he crownit Rewthar in the chair
of merbyl. Money of the nobyllis war nocht content of their doyngis, hauand great
indignatioun that both thayr king was slane, and ye lawis concerning the
electioun of their prince abrogat be his private auctoryte, and ane ounge child
maid king aganis their honourabyll actis laitly maid for their commoun weill.

Their nobyllis that war of this mind maid ane private conuentioun togydder, and
amang thaym was Ferquhard capytane of Kyntyre and Lorne, maich to king Nathak,
ane man of subtle ^ngyne and hauand great ambition to the crown. This Ferquhard
beleuyng the time ganand to conques the crown with dissimilit mind (as he wald
debait the action of the commoun weill) complanit both the slauchter of
Nathak be the cruel Dowall, and ane barn maid king to the damage of the
pepyll and commoun weill. And exhortit thairfore the cou^sall to provide ane
haisty remeid to resist the tyranny of Dowall, quhilk intendit to vsurp the
crown in name of Rewther. And gyf the samyn war nocht done, sic sedicioun and
civil weiris ^all rise hais^ely amang the chiftanis of their realm, that the
samyn should find ane haisty subuersioun. Skarsly war their wordis sai^ quhen
Dowal enterit with ane ban^ of men and slew syndry nobillis in the counsall,
bot Ferquhard evil woundit eschapit with ane certane of his frendis, and fled
in the Ilis, quhare he conuenit all the cla^nis and pepyll thairof to ane
counsall, and said in this manner. Had we obseruit the lawis concerning the
election of our kyngis. (May vaileant pepyll) it had nocht been necessar to
me this day to make this orisoun, for we mycht have leiffit in good tranquillite
and peace under ye empire of Nathak our wise and vaileant prince now laitly
slane be Dowall the cruel tyrane. Attour to aggrege this importabyl cruelte i^
mair dammaige of our commoun weill, he hes nocht only slane our king, bot
intrusit ane oung child in his place in plane derogatioun of our lawis,
inte^dyng thairthrow to bring both ws and our commoun weill to vter myscheif.
I find na thing (may forcy campionis) yt may seem ws les, than to lurk heir
schamfully as effiminat pepyll, eschewyng the wraith of our ennymes, and
regardyng nouthir our honor nor proffet, Sen their is na other way sa plesand
to strenth our ennymes, and to febyll our self. This may cruel tyrane hes
nocht only slane the nobilles of this realm, bot slane ye preistes and
religious men, and that na esperance should remane in ws to withstand his
cruelte, he hes tressonably put down all the vaileant men that fauorit ws in
Albion. He haldis all the ^igit men (that mycht have proffit ws be their wise
counsall) in sic captivity, yt they ar na better than deid.

And that he may oppres ws with more pissance, he hes maryit R^wther ane oung
child (quhome he namis king) on the douchter of Gethus king of Pychtis. This
unmercifully tyrane hes deuysit (as we are surely aduertist) als sone as he hes
vincust ws, to cut our eyris, and put out our eyne, that we may then remane
on live to our schame and perpetual derisioun.

it will e concur with ma^heid and wisdom to my opinioun, traist fermely e sall
nocht only eschew sic cruelteis be favor of goddis, bot punis him conform to
his demerites and beleyf fermely that all thyngis sall succeed to ws with hie
felicite, gyf we with na les curage than wisdom defend our rycht our
liberte, and our faith. For we se often times vaileant and great pryncis deieckit
fra their honor and Imperyall dygnyteis, quhen they applaudit to tressoun and
falset. Heirfore gyf we be men and worthy to be callit the posterite of our

How Ferquhard and Dovvall recountering vthir be plane battall war both
slane with all the nobyllyte of Scottis and Pichtis, the king of Pichtis
slane, and the king of Scottis taken. Ca. vii.
THe capitanis of the Tribis and pepyll thairof mouit i^ great hatrent be their
wordis, turnit all feir of deith in may ragea^d fury, and baithit their
ha^dis with mannis blude, as ye ryte was in they dayis and maid their aithis to
revenge the slauchter of Nathak and his nobyllis in the scharpest manner that
mycht be deuisit. And but moretary they gaderit ane army out of Ireland,
Argyle, Lorne, Canter, and other partis adjacent. Syne landit with money galouns
and lang faddis in Albioun. Ferquhard returnyng in this wise drew money of the
pepyll (quhare he come) to his opinioun. And tuke their aithis outhir to
revenge the slauchter of king Nathak, or ellis to de all at anis. Dowall
knawyng his cummyng, met him with an army at Berigone, quhare it was cruelly
fouchtyn on all sydis. Bot at last Dowall was discomfist, and seuyn thousand
men of his army slane, and it more slauchter had been maid, war nocht the nycht
seuerit thaym. On the morrow Dowall with furius hatrent colleckit the resydew
of his army to new array, hauand with him Gethus king of Pichtis, and Rewthar
king of Scottis with money of all the nobyllis of both their realms. On the
army aduersar was Ferquhard with ye inhabitantis of Cathnes, Argyle, Murray,
and money otheris of the Ilis. Their two armyis met finally togydder in mair fury
than before, and faucht neir to the vter exterminioun of thaym both.

In this unhappy battall was slane Gethus king of Pichtis with incredibyll
nowmer both of nobyllis and commounis, and both the chiftanis Dowall and
Ferquhard slane with all the nobilite of Scottis. This lamentabyll and unhappy
battall was fochtyn with sic perseuerant hatrent, that allanerly remanit.viii.
hundred men vnslane on both the sydis. The resydew of Ferquhardis army (to
quhome this vnplesand vyctory succedit) seeing the field left after sa huge
murdir, followit on ye chais, with ythand slauchter, quhyll they come to the
castle of Callender, their was king Rewther taken. Throw this unhappy battall
was maid sa terribyll slauchter, that money eiris after nouthir Scottis nor
Pychtis was left on lyffe sufficient to inhabit this realm, nor it to
withstand their ennymes.

How the Scottis and Pychtis war doung out of Albion be the Brytonis, Ca.
viii.
THe Britonis (quhilkis war ay our ennymes) heirand these lame^tabyl
distructioun of Scottis and Pychtis cumyng on thaym be vnprudence of civil
weris, traistit the time sufficient to make thaym reiose ye hale empire of
Albion. And thairfore rasit their army in may weirly ordinance, and inuadit
syndry landis of Pychtis both with swerd and fire. The Pychtis brokin with the
weiris before reheirsit, and disparit of support gaderit all their (...) ^ll and
gudis with their wiffis. children* and freindis, and come be money wylsome and
difficil gaitis to Orknay, and after their cumyng chesit G^^hus, brother to
king Gethus before deceissit to be their king, and dwelt syndry eris after in ye
said regioun in good peace and freindschip with the pepyll thairof. Thairfore
Orknay was ay namyt the aulde realm of Pichtis. The Brytonis herand ye Pichtis
departit in this wise come in Penthland, Mers, and Teuydaill, and plenist all
the strenthis thairof with their gudis and pepyl, and nocht lang after they
come in ye Scottis landis. The Scottis rich^ affrayit of their cumyng, and
seeing na other remeid drew thaim to their harnes and wappynnis, and met thaym
in arrayit battall at Calder wod. Nochttheles the scottis war discomfist and
two thousand of thaym slane, ye resydew fled heir and their in syndry partis,
The fame of this unhappy battall maid the pepyl na les disparit, than all the
nobyll blude of Fergus had been endit that day in Albion. The Brytonis proud
and insolent be their feliciteis herand be their exploratouris, that ane certane
of scottis (quhilkis eschapit fra this last battal) war fled to Berigone for
defense of king Rewther (for he was in the said castle with ane few nowmer of
nobyllis) and the resydew of Scottis with their wiffis and barnis fled in the
Ilis, gaderit ane army be the ordinance of Oenus their king, and lade ane sege
to the said castle. Nochttheles the Scottis defe^dit it lang time, quhil at
last they war dreuyn to sic penurite (because their vittallis faileit) that they
kest cauillis quha should be first deuorit to sustene the liffis of thaym that
war within the house. And because they saw the may vaileant campionis fall to
be deuorit in this miserabyll wise, they deuysit the samyn nycht to ische on
their ennymes, and erar to revenge sum displesour on thaym, tha^ miserably to
de in that sort, and that the king micht ische more esely with his noblis they
deuysit y^ Colane chiftane of Lorne sal ysche with ane hundredth me^ to ye nixt
montane. And as it was deuysit so followit, for Colane yschyng forth on this
wise, and fechtand to the vter exterminioun of his fayis, was finaly slane with
all his folkis. And in the mean time (quhen he was may ernestly fechtand king
Rewther ischit at ane quiet posthern with his nobyllis, and come hastily to the sea, quhair schyppis war reddy abidynge his cumyng. Rewther eschapyng on this
manner arriuit in the Ilis, and fyndyng their na securite of his lyffe, he past
in Ireland. The wiffis of ye tribe of Lorne seeing all their hus^a^dis slane
before their ene, slew thaym self, that they should nocht remane in servitude of
their ennymes. The Britonis knawyng fynaly how Rewther and his nobyllis war
eschapit, war sa co^mouit yt they slew the resydew of Scottis in all partis
quhair they war apprehendit. Syne garnist all the strenthis of Scottis with
their garisonis. The resydew of the scottis sauit be their fleyng and seeing
thaym self nocht of pissance to resist the Britonis, fled to the montanis, and
debaitit their miserabyll lyffis be straytnes of the ground, with scars and
hard fude, leuand in the somer on mylknes, rutis of herbis, and beryis. And in
the winter of wyld flesche of the montanis. And sumtyme they draif great prayis
of bestial be dirknes of nycht fra ye Britonis, to sustene their liffis. Thus
stude the Scottis and Pychtis (that abaid in Albion) nere twelf eris under
servitude of Britonis.

How the Scottis and Pichtis recouerit their landis, and discomfist Sysyll
king of Britonis, and of the resydevv of king Revvtheris liffe. Ca. ix.
QUhill sic things war done i^ Albion. King Rewther had on his wife in Ireland
ane son namyt Thereus. And not lang after be request of Gethus king of
Pichtis, he returnit in Albion, and landit at Lochbroun i^ Ros. Als sone as the
Scottis war returnit on this wise i^ Albion, they slew be auld rite the first
man they met, and bathit their mouth and swordis i^ his blud, syne prayit the
goddis to grant thaym sic felicite that they may condingly revenge the
slauchter of their progenitouris. Belyue they maid thaym to pas forthwart
towart the south. And in the mean time they war aduertist that Gethus king of
Pichtis was cumyn wtin.xxx. milis to thaim with ane great army that was send to
thaym be their freindis out of Albion to help thaym to recover their landis.
The third day after both the armyis met togydder with great triumph, and
passing forthwart to ye south they met all the Scottis and Pichtis quhilkis war
haldyn ye eir before under seruytude. Sysyl king of Brytonis herand their
tythyngis gatherit haistely ane army to reconter his ennymes. Incontinent the
co^fiderat pepyll but any sicht to conques any strenthis or gudis entrit with
auful army in Britane, and inuadit the samyn with great iniure and cruelteis.
King Sysyll to revenge their cruelteis inuadit the scottis and Pichtis with
haiste battall. Nochttheles his army was fynaly disconfyst. The hie and
souerane manheid of king Rewther was principal occasyon of this glorius
victory. And in memory thairof ye cuntre (quhare the battall was fochtin) is
callit it to our dayis Rethirdayll, that is to say ye vale of Rewthir. This
battal was sa cruelly fochtin, that both the armyis war constranit to talk
peace under their conditionis. The Britonis sall render all the strenthis landis
and townis pertenyng to the Scottis and Pichtis, and sal nocht inuaid thaym in
times cumyng. The Scottis Pychtis and Brytonis leuit money eris after in good
tra^quillite and peace. The eir that king Rewther recouerit his realm was fra
the beginning of ye world.iiii.M.ix.C.lxxxxv. eris. before ye
incarnatioun.CC.iiii. eris. fra ye beginning of Rome.v.C.xlvi. eris. King
Rewther leuit the resydew of his dayis but any uncouth weris or seditioun of
his liegis, and deceissit the.xxvi. eir of his regne.

Of king Revvtha and his lavvis and governance. How Ptolome king of Egypt send
his oratouris to se the situatioun of Scotland. Ca. x.
REwther deceissit (as we have schawin) his son Thereus was of so tender age
yt he mycht nocht succeid to the crown, be ^eason of the lawis before rehersit.
And thairfore his cusyng Rewtha was maid king, for they war brethir barnis.
This Rewtha was the first king amang the scottis, y^ ^aud ingyne to put nobyll
men for their vaileant dedis in memory, and maid rich sepultures for ye bodi^s
of thaym yt war slane be Brytonis in defense of this realm. He commandit als
money hie stanis to be set about the sepulture of every nobil man, as was slane
be him of Brytonis. In memory heirof syndry of thaym remanis it in the hie
landis, that the pepyll may know sic men war vaileant in their dayis. Throw
quhylk it come i^ use, that the sepulturis of nobyll me^ was haldyn i^ great
reverence amang the pepyll. On their sepulturis was ingrauyn ymageris of
dragonis, wolfis, and other beistis. For na inuentioun of letteris was in they
dayis to put the deidis of nobyl men in memore. The commoun pepyll was geuyn
that time to store of beistis and telyng of their landis but any other
industry. Thus ^^^et al ingenious craftis in this cuntre. And thairfore king
Rewtha brocht all manner of craftismen out of other contres, and sparpellit
thaym in syndry schiris of his realm with feis and dewteis, sum part to be
takyn on the commoun purs, and sum part as they mycht wyn be thayr laubouris.
The heid of every ox that was slane was geuyn to the smyth of that schyre, the
^rag to the forester of the wod, the tongue to the man of law, half ane cost to
the sercheouris of theuis, als mekyll to the wricht, two rybbis of the cost to
the medcinat, als mekyll to the surrurgiane. And beside this war geuyn to thaym
certane mesouris of aitis and beir, because na change of money was i^ they
dayis. Throw partyng of the ox in this wyis raise up the annuell rentis in this
land. After that king Rewtha had plenist his realm on this manner with
craftismen, he was informit, that great damage fell oftymis to his pepyl be
ignorance of evil medcinaris, and thairfore he inhibit under pain of deid yt
any man exerce ye art of medicinary, without they war found richt expert with
lang experience thairof. Before this time na medcinaris was vsit in this cuntre.
For all personis (that war trublit with infirmiteis) war brocht to the marcat,
or to any other commoun place, quhare the pepyll mycht se thaym, to gyf thaym
counsall to use sic remedyis, as they vsit quhen they conualescit of thayr
maledis. It was ane thing richt odius in they dayis to visee nocht the pacient
with comfort and consolation. About this time come certane oratouris fra king
Ptolome of Egypt, to explore ye maneris and situacioun of every pepyll and
regioun, thi^ oratouris war plesandlie ressauit be ye king. For they war
discendit of ye Egiptianis his forbearis. The king gart conuoy thaym bath throw
the realm of Scottis and pychtis according to their desyris. Their oratoures
wrait in their bukis, the situatioun of hillis, firthis, Ilis, townis, lochis
and castellis within this region, with the lenth of dayis and nychtis both in
winter and symer, as they war comma^dit be king Ptolome, quhilk gaif his ingyne
to discriue ye situatioun of the erd in every regioun and Ilis quhare any me^
vsit to have passage with discriptioun of the montanis firthis and cieteis of
the samyn be diverse instruments of astronomy. Be quhais deligence and laubour
remanis now ane rycht crafty and proffitable werk namit the Cosmographe of
Ptolome richt expert i^ methamatik. This ingenius werk was completit in the
time of Adriane the empriour. Quhen their oratouris had seen and degeistlie
considerit this regioun, they persauit the samyn ritis the same manner of
writtyngis, the same tongue and the same habit and cerymonyis as was vsit amang
the Egiptianis. And for that cause their oratouris war the more plesandly^
depischit of this realm. King Rewther gouernit his realm.xiiii. eris efti^ i^
great Justice, but any uncouth or civil weris. Quhill at last he began to
suspek his lang felicite. And thairfore to preuene all calamite (gif any war
approcheand be mischance of fortoun) he resignit the crown to Thereus son to
king Rewther the xvii. eir of his regne.

Of king Thereus. and how he was exilit for his tyranny. How Conane chiftane
of brigandis was maid governor during his proscription. Ca. xi.
THereus ress^uing ye crown on this man apperit the first sex monethis of his
regne to be ane virtewis prince. Bot sone eftir he becam ane vicious tyrane
inuoluit so with lust, yt he had na regard to ressone, honesty, nor Justice, and
was namit amang the pepill ye scornar of religioun. Ye pepill be Imitation of
this insolent prince increscit every day more and more in corruppit maneris.
Throw quhilk followit Ithand slauchter of nobill men, with reif and
heirschippis in all partis. Strongest theuis and gretest oppressouris war
haldin in may veneratioun and honouris. The co^monis war sa disparit for ye
irrecouerable skaithis done to thaym that they traistit nocht possibil any
tyrane more vicious mycht regne above thaim. The capitanis of ye tribis mouit
be their insufferable offe^cis thocht unworthy, that any noble men should be
misgidit be sic ane corruppit monstour. And thairfore maid ane quiet
conuentioun amang thaym self. In the quhilk they co^cludit both to degraid him
of his crown and kingdom. Thereus heirand this conspiratioun of his nobillis
aganis him, was sa astonist, that he fled in Brytane. At last quhen he had
socht la^g time support of the Britonis to restore him to his realm, frustrat
yair of, he co^sumit ye residew of his dayis in misere at ork the.xii. eir of
his regne. Quhen Thereus was exilit on this manner, the nobillis of Scotland
(that their common weill sal incur na damage for lakyng of ane king) chesit
Conane capitane of Brigandis to be governor. This Conane (after that he was
maid governor) tuke great laubouris to meis al dissentionis that war rissyn
before amang ye nobyllis be sleuth of Thereus. He punist theiffis, reuers, and
other criminabyll personis with sic seuerite and Justice, that the bestiall and
gudis lay thairfurth but any trubyl. Quhill at last king Therus deceissit in
Brytane, be quhais deith his auctorite was expirit.

Of king Iosyne, and of the experience and prechyng of two philosophouris. Ca.
xii.
ALs sone as the nobillis war aduertist of the deith of Thereus, they maid ane
conuentioun at Berigon. In ye quhilk Iosyne bruther to Thereus was maid king.
This Iosyne renewit ye peace with his nychtbouris the Pichtis and Britonis, and
held surrurgianis and medcinaris in great reverence. For he was nurist the time
of his outheid with sic personis in Ireland, he was ane good medicinar, and had
good experience of herbis. Our forbearis vsit na other medcin in curyng their
woundis or infirmiteis, bot herbis. And in they dayis their was nocht sa money
diverse kindis of maladyis, as now ar seen. Few infirmiteis war seen that time,
bot grauellis caterris and siclike maladyis cumyng throw distemperance of cauld
and donk humouris. The pepyll leiffit with sa skars and natural fude, that
they had nocht only lang dayis, bot war preseruit fra all manner of maledyis.
Nochtheles fra the abstinence of our forebearis was set aside, tha^ uncouth and
delicious coursis began to multiply sa ^mang ws, yt with vncuth and strange
metis, come uncouth and strange infirmiteis. And because the vneme^tis and
drogareis yt our forbearis vsit mycht nocht cure the new maledyis, the pepyl
war co^stranit throw importabyl dolor incressing be the samyn, to seek remeid
be new ingyne and craft. And sen our time is now sa ve^nomit with uncouth and
superflew metis and dri^kis, we thocht sum thing necessar to rehers the
temperance of our forebearis in their leuyng, with sic maledyis and remedyis as
war vsit in their dayis. Of quhilkis sall be schawin more largely after, quhen
time occurris more expedient. In ye time of king Iosyne war brocht to his
presence at Berigone two venerabyll clerkis, of pleasant visage, bot they war al
may nakit. It is wryttin yt they war preis^is of Spane, and passing out of
Portingale to Athenes be unmerciful tempest of sees, war schip brokin at Ros,
their schip and remanent pepyl (that was with thaym) perist, and they only
sauit. And because they war philosophouris and me^ of great experience, they war
weill tretit. At last quhen they war xiiii. dayis refreschit after their
walkyng and trubyll of see, they war brocht agane to ye kyngis presence. The
king dema^dit thaim to schaw quhat they understood of the nature of the ground
of Scotland, and of the maneris and religioun of the pepyll thairof. Their
philosophouris answerit, they mycht nocht say perfitely to their questionis,
because they had nocht lang time to have experience thairof, and als war sum
part febillit in their fa^tasyis, for the calamite laitly falling to thaym be
storm of sees. Nochtheles (sa far as they micht conjecture) their was more
riches and proffet to be gottin within the vanis of the erd of Scotland, tha^
above. For it was more geuyn to winnyng of mynis and metallis, tha^ any
production of cornis. They knew this (said their philosophouris) be the
influence of the heuyn, as to the maneris and religion of ye pepyll, they
declarit their religion was nocht to be commendit, for they adorit ymagis of
brutall beistis, in form of leuand goddis, as ye Egiptianis vsit quhilk should
nocht be. For god was that thing only, that contenit landis, sees, and every
creature. Quhais perfyte and verray image cannot be payntit nor deuysit be
i^gyne of man. It was necessar thairfore yt the pepyll should leif their
ydolatryis. And adore allanerly the leuand god mouer of the heuynnis, with
sacryfyce and prayer in their tempillis allanerly but any ymageryis. And finaly
to leif in hope of reward, gif they leiffit with clean lif, and Justice, vthir
ways not was deuisit for thaym bot dolor and torment. Their philosophouris
preching in this manner inducit ye pepyll to leif their ydolatryis, makand their
sacrifice and prayer allanerly to the mouer of heuyn the eternal god. Thus war
the pepyll brocht to that way yt the sacrifice (yt was wont to be geuyn to Isis
and Apis the goddis of Egypt) was abrogat. Throw quhilk the scottis war money
eris after sa religious, that they made ado^ation only to god the mouar of the
heuyn. it vtheris war sa indurat i^ their awn errouris, that they couth nocht
omyt their auld superstitionis, and beleuit firmly that the son, moan, and
otheris the sternis and lanternis of ye heuyn, war verray goddis. For they war
sa obstinat and blyndit in the auld arrour of gentilis, ye quhe^ they saw na
thing in erd more bricht nor meruellus, tha^ the son, moan, and other lychtis
of the heuyn, they beleuit sum divinity thairin, and adorit thaym as goddis.
This history (sa far as it is now drawin) is colleckit out of Ueremond, Iohne
Campbell, and Cornelius Ireland, quhom we have determit to follow (as may
aute^tik auctouris) to ye end of this our quhatsu^euer work. King Iosyne was
ane virtuous prince, and deceissit at Berigone the.xxiiii. eir of his regne.

Of king Fynnane and his lavvis. And of the college of clerkis in the I Will of
Man. Ca. xiii.
After the deith of Iosyne, his son Finnane ane wise and virtuous prince was
maid king. He was sa great luffar of Justice, that he rychely rewardit all the
capitanis of the Tribis, quhare he fand thaym luffaris of the co^moun weill. He
gaif his hale attendance to win the hertis of his pepyll, and maid na
exercition nor ministration of Justice, but advise of his nobillis. He ekit the
nowmer of his counsal with ma Senatouris tha^ was before to make thaym ye more
renoumit. He maid ane law, that the king sall do na thing concerning ye publik
administration of his realm, but advise of his nobillis. He maid als ane other
law that the king sall nothir denonce weir nor treit peace, but advise of ye
capitanis of Tribis. Be their and siclike constitutionis, king Fynnane conquest
great favor and beniuolence of his pepyll. Be this manner of governance he maid
him sa strange amang his liegis, that he was neuir assaileit after with any
uncouth weris, and grew in great abou^dance of riches. Fynaly he set his mind to
repare ye religion of goddis* for it was decait in his faders time. First he
commandit the ymagis of their goddis to be restorit to thayr tempillis, that
the pepil mycht have the samyn i^ adoration as before. And it he wald nocht
inhibit the pepil to adore the leuand god mouer of heuyn. For that was
institute before be the philosophouris. He sufferit his pepill to adore quhat
god they plesit. He was the first king that institute prelatis and clerkis to
be in yis realm. And that their clerkis should remane togidder, he gaif thaym ye
I Will of Man lyand betuix Ireland and Britane fornens Brigance, quhare their
principal seit was ordanit to be. Their clerkis conuenit Ilk eir anis at the
command of the great may and bischop thairof, specialie quhen any hie and
wechty materis occur^^^ concerning the defense of thayr (...) or common weil.
Their preis^is war namyt Druydes, and was ^^stitute in this I Will be aduy^e of the
king and his nobillis. To make sacrifice in ye honor of their goddis, and to
instruk the sonnis of nobill men in virtew and science, siclik as they war
lernit at Athenes. It was commandit that ane of thaym as bischop and master
sall have Iurisdictioun above the laif. Before quhom was borne ane gleib of
fire in sign of hes honor and divinity. Eft quhais deith ane other may
approcheand to virtew and cunnyng, was chosyn to succeid in his place. Their
clerkis throw their Ithand exercitioun increscit sone eftir rycht expart in
moral and natural philosophy. And was haldin be the pepill may Just and
haly creaturis. They maid lawis to discus the doutis both of publik and
singular actionis. And deuisit nocht only punitioun for all manner of cryines,
bot ordanit condign rewardis to be geuyn for all good deeds. They cursit thaym
that contempnit their auctorite. This punition was euir odious amang our
forbearis. For ye cursit pepil war in they dayis resecat fra al good cumpany,
and not participant with the reward of honouris or digniteis, bot numerit amang
the cumpany of infamyt and wickit misdoaris. Their preistis war exemit fra all
chargis of weir and other exactionis. Of their preistis writtis money auctouris,
affirmyng their ordour and religioun first found in Britane. For they call the
hail I Will of Albion under ane name Britane. Fynnane was ane virtuous prince and
na les honorit for his civil than religious maneris, be quhilkis he decorit his
realm. He maryit his son Durstus on Agasia douchter to the king of Britonis,
and conquest be the samyn na litill glore and benevolence amang the britonis.
At last he past to gyf consolation to ye king of pychtis, quhilk was lyand ye
time i^ vehement fever at Camelon quhare he deceissit the.xxx. eir of his
regne. His body was brocht to berigone, and beriit amang the remanent
sepulturis of his progenitouris.

Of king Durstus, and how he was slane for his cruel tyranny. Ca. xiiii.
FYnnane deceissit on this wise, his son Durstus was maid king. Yis Durstus
be insole^t outh was geuyn to drounknes and vnbridelit lust, and so different
fra his faderis governance, yt he hat tit all thaym that his fader luffit. He
brak the ordour of law that was institute before be his progenitouris for
ministratioun of Justice. He vsit na counsal in great materis, bot only of
thaym that fauorit his vicious maneris, and culd find to him new manner of
lustis. He was sa mischeuous ane tyrane, that al ye nobil men (that his fader
vsit on his secret counsall) war be him other slane or banist, Or ellis be
feyneit causis forfaltit of their landis and guddis. And finalie he was brocht
to sic cruelte, that not only he slew yame (quhilkes war odius to him) bot als
slew al thaym quhare he beleuit to get any riches or guddis be their deith. He
repudiat his nobil queen Agasia the king of Britonis dochter. And gart his
vicious harlotis deforce her. Quhill this unhappy tyrane was inuoluit with their
and siclik abominable dedis, the capitanis of the Ilis, Lorne Argyle and Ros
be frequent conuentionis amang thaym self, maid ane conspiratioun aganis him.
So far haitit their capitanis the rage of tyrany, that they wald na langar abid
at his opinion. And to yat fine they sall nocht appear as brekaris of the faith
that should be kepit to their natural prince, they schew thaym be opin
proclamation ^^cht assemblit to inuaid the (...) only to punys his vicious and
unhappy counsalouris, be quhome the realm was brocht to sic enormiteis, that
without remeid war haistely prouydit, ye samyn should pas to vter rewyne. Quhyll
the capitanis foresaid war preparand their armis on this manner, the co^monis
rycht desy^us to dystroy this tyrane, raise haist^^y on athir hand to assist to
their capitanis. it part of the commonis wald nocht concur with their
capitanis, beleuyng thaym nocht assemblit for any common weill, bot only to
usurp the crown. Durstus na litil affrayit o^ their assemblance (for he knew
him self gilty) maid him to flee, and seand na place sufficient to keip him he
send to the Britonis desyring his queen Agasia to be send to him with ane power
of armyt men, to resyst ane certane of his nobyllis aganis him conspirit. At
last seand na support apperand, he began to turn his treasonabyll mind to
falset and slychtis. And tuke purpos to sla their co^spiratouris be sum hyd
waching. Beleuyng be that way only to eschew the danger apperyng. Incontinent
he send ambassatouris to their capitanis, and feneit him sa penitent, that he
wald reform all offe^cis and iniuris done be him in perditioun of the commoun
weill, and promittit nocht only to govern the realm in times cumyng be their
advise, bot to punys his wickit cou^salouris, quhilkis war occasioun of all
displesouris be him done. It was als ane odious thing to ane king to fecht
aganis his subdittis, specially quhen they ar nocht set to degraid him of his
crown, bot only to reduce him to better estait. And for the observation thairof
he wald bynd him in the tempyll of Dyane, under quhat astrictionis they plesit.
And gyf that mycht nocht be sufficient, he should cum to thaym but any assurance,
and submit him to underly quhat correctioun they pleasit. And that his wordis
mycht have the more credyt, he kest ane certane of his seruitouris in prysone,
as he war to punys thaym to the deith for their assistence to his vices.
Otheris of small estimatioun he arrayit in precious cl^thyng, and send thayme
to the said capitanis to be punyst at thayr plesour. The capitanis geuand
haistelye credence to his wordis, send Doron capytane of the Trybe of Lorne to
take his aithis eftir his promys. Thus was Durstus brocht in the temple of
Diane, and sworn before ye priest thairof with all aithis that couth be
deuisit, to ressaue their capitanis to may tender freindschip Remitting the
rankour of his mind with all manner of crime that micht be imput to thaym. And
not only to hald thaym as his faithful and tendir freindis, bot to govern
the realm in times cummyng be their auise. Als sone as their capitanis be vane
confidence were cumyn to him, he ressauit yame sa plesandlye, that both his
wordis visage and contenance apperit but any dissimilance. Thus was general
concord and blythnes maid on athir side. King Durstus reiosyng of this concord
callit their capitanis to ane banquet within his castle of Berigone. Als sone as
they war entrit, this unmercifully tyrane past to ane towr of the castle. And
incontinent certane armyt me^ ruschit forth of the chalmeris quhare they war
hyd, and slew their capitanis and all vtheris that enterit in the castle of
their opinioun. The wiffis and matronis that followit their husbands to this
terrible banquet evil hurt and woundit in debait of their said husbandis past
out of Berigone with dolorus spraichis, crying vengeans on this cursit tyrane
for violatioun of his faith and promys. This treson and falset of Durstus was
nocht lang vnpunist. For all the remanent freindis of their capitanis assemblit
ane army both of men and women sufficient to beir wappynnis sa haistely, that
they laid ane sege about ye castle of Berigone or Durstus was aduertist yairof.
Ane certane of yam past incontinent to the wallis, and said / they should have
sone experience, quhidder he was more crafty in treason or fechtyng. Durstus
disparit of help come out of ye castle in his wod fury with ane cumpany of
evil arrayit people. And was sone spuleit both of his liffe and crown the nynt
eir of his regne. And howbeit he was ane vicious tyrane, he was buryit in ane
kingly sepulture amang his forbearis.

Of great contention amang the capitanis. Of the orisoun maid be Charon capitane
of Argyle, and how Evvin the first of that name was maid king. Ca. xv.
DUrstus slane in yis manner, his sonnys fled in Ireland. sone eftir ane
co^uention was maid to cheis the king. The nobillis beand all of ane mind,
concludit to suffir nane of Durstus blude to regne above thaym, in adventure ye
sum of yame should revenge his slauchter. And their fore they tuke lang
consultation of quhat lynage, and blud ye king should be chosin. Su^ desyrit
Ragaon chiftane of the Ilis, for he co^spyrit first aganis Durstus. it because
he fauourit evil dedy men he was repellit. Utheris desyrit Cormanus capitane
of Lorne Thus war ye Tribis deuidit in syndry vocis. Eft la^g^^te^ion, Charon
capitane of Argyle said i^ this manner. e may have perfect experience (wise
faderis) be the civil weris of Dowall and Ferquhard, and now more recentlie be
ye empire of wickit Durstus, how dangerus and unthankful is to all pepill to
have ane cruel tyrane regnand above thaym. For be they samyn weris yis nobil
realm (quhilk has been debatit sa money eris with great manheid wisdom and
curage) was neir brocht to final euerstone. For be the samyn weris our
nobilles war slane, and our co^monis brocht to sa vile servitude / that (gyf
the samyn had continewit) our name and lynage should have perist in Albione.
Quhat misery sustenit our faderis in Berigone? quhen they war co^stranit be
vrge^t necessite to saif their miserable lyuis on the fude of their bowelles.
Quhat danger sustenit our king Rewther euadyng his ennymes be may perellus
Ischeyng? quhen his realm was neir lost, and Colane the vaileant capitane
slane only for defense of him and his realm. Quhat fury was in they nobill
women? that slew thaym self at Berigone that they should nocht leif in servitude
of ennimes. Quhat hes brocht our nobillis to sic mesiry that they war banist
and socht suple at uncouth realms? nocht bot sedition intestyne ama^g thaym
self. The Britonis for all their riches and cheualrie, mycht neuir have maid sic
incursionis and heirschippis on our landis and people. War nocht we maid first
ane reddy gait to thaym be our awin dissentioun. It is thairfore to be eschewit
(rycht vailea^t men) that this dissentioun now risyng amang ow, cum nocht to
damage of our common weil. e have deliuerit now laithe the realm of the
tyranny of Durstus. e have sufficientlye reuengit the slauchter of the nobillis
be his deith. Now is the time may ganand to help our materis. Tyne nocht (my
good freindis) the victory be civil dissentioun, that e have conquest with great
labor. e se the pepil glaid of Durstus deith, and desirus to have ane king be
our election. Quhil they ar now at our opinioun, make ane king yat will tak our
part. Otherwayis na thing salbe amang ow, bot civil weris, heirschippis, and
slauchter both of nobillis and commonis. And in the meyntyme sum of Durstus
freindis sall nocht only vsurp the crown, bot sall punys ow for his slauchter.
The nobillis and commonis seand Charon of sic exellent wisdom, gaif to him
power to cheis quhom he thocht best to be king. Than Charon (that the crown sal
remane ay of ye same blud) chesit Ewin the first of that name to be king, for
Durstus and Ewin war brethir sonnis. Thus was Ewin crownit in the chair of
marbill at berigone. This castle was haldin certane dayis aganis him be
freindes of Durstus. Nochtheles it was finalie randerit. This Ewin was the
first king of Scottis, that socht the aith of fidelite fra his subditis / that
is to say / that his nobillis and subditis should be leil and true to him. Throw
quhilk it come in use money eris eftir, that all the capitanis of tribis at
their electioun constranit their subditis to gyf their aithis of fidelite.
Quhilk ryte is it obseruit. For the pepill dwelling in the hie land and Ilis
thairof, at electioun of their capitane haldis up their handis to be leil and
true to him. And als sone as the Capitane Is chosyn, they past to the nyxt
mote, and defendis under pane of deid, ye nane of thaym name their capitane
with any vthir sloggorne bot with the auld name of that Tribe. And quhen they
heir his name, to bek and discover their heid, with na les reverence than he
war a god. I belief thairfore that ye pepyll that dwellis in hie land or in the
Ilis, quhen their hieest besynes occurris, sweris be the fute or hand or name
of their capitane, as sum hyd divinity war in the same. Ewin to stabyl his
realm in virtew, commandit the oung children of his realm to be nurist with
skars and hard fude. And to sleip erar on hard burdis, than on plumis or
coddis. And to be ythandly exercit in swift rynnyng, and werslyng, to make
thaym the more abyll to debait his realm, quhen time requirit. And ordanit
thaym to abstene fra all thing that micht make thaym soft or effeminat. This
virtuus prince past throw all the boundis of his realm for ministration of
Justice, and punist criminabyll personis with syndry punitioun. Sum skurgit,
and sum he punist to ye deith. The samyn time come the ambassatouris of Pichtis
desyryng be the tenoure of confideratioun to have support aganis the Britonis,
quhilkis war laitly cummyng with great incursionis in the Mers, and purposit to
sege their ciete of Camelon. King Ewin to support his confiderate freindis,
come with ane haisty army aganis the Brytonis. The Scottis and Pichtis
asse^blit in this manner, went forthwart with na les curage, tha^ victory had been present in their handis. So far war their myndis inflammit to revenge the
iniuris done to thaym in ye eris before. The Britonis na thing affrayit of their
cumyng met thaym with na les ferocite, on the tothir (...) followit ane
dangerus and cruel battall fochtin lang time with vncertane victory. Bot at
last the nicht seuerit thaym with rycht sorrowful and doutsum chance of battal.
The confiderat kyngis seand their army brokyn fled under nycht to Pentland
hyllis. And ye Britonis brokyn with siclike calamite, and disparit of any new
support, fled on ye same manner as disconfist pepyll, and left their carage
behind thaym. Als sone as ye confiderat pepyl war aduertist heirof, they
returnit to the same partis quhare ye Brytonis war ca^pit before, and partit the
spule thairof be custum of armies. Sic thyngis done king Ewin returnit to
Berigon, and rewardit richely ye freindis of thaym that war slane in this
battall. Sum of his capitanis for their prouyn vassalage war promouit to publik
officis, and othirs rewardit with riches and gudis. And fra thens he concludit
to govern his realm in tra^quillite and peace. He maid certane Iugis to abide
in syndry regionis of his realm, to minister justice to the pepil. He ordanit
certane exploratouris to remane in ilk schire, that they micht search sornaris,
theiffis, and reiffaris, and bring thaym to his lawis. And that their
exploratouris mycht continue in their office, he dotat thaym with syndry
landis. In memory heirof remanis it to our days syndry infeftmentis of auld
baronis, quhais landis war geuyn be virtuous princis for the samyn cause.
Howbeit they exerce nocht the effect thairof. King Ewin biggit ane castle nocht
far fra Berigon callit then Ewin after his name, now callit Dounstatage, and
gidit his realm money eris after to the great commodite of his common weil, and
deceissit the.xix. eir of his regne.

How Gillus bastard son to king Evvin slew two sonnis and two nepotis of
Du^stus to make him self king, and how the third nepot Edeir eschapit. Ca. xvi.
EFtir deith of Ewin his bastard son Gillus, conuenit the nobillis to bury his
fader. And in the time of hes obsequies com Dothane and Dorgall two sonnis of
Durstus, fast contendyng for the crown. For they war reconseld with king Ewin
before his death. it because they war two twynnis borne atanis, the law couth
nocht decerne in they dayis, quhilk of thaym had may richt to the crown. Thus
raise ane schamful debait betuix their two brethir, Ilk ane of thaym set i^ other
slauchtir. This Gillus was ane man of subtell Ingyne, and seik and occasioun to
conquis the crown, ekit the hatrent of their two brethir be money slichtis and
armit yame in athir slauchter. At last be appointment of Gillus, their two
brethir war brocht togidder to be agreit be auise of freindis of all debatis,
and ane of thaym to be maid king. Nochtheles they war sa extreme at this
conuentioun on athir side, yt they partit war freindis than they met. Nocht
lang eftir they war brocht agane be Gillus in ane secreit chalmer. Eftir lang
consultatioun, it was concludit su^ time to divide the crown betuix thaym, and
sum time to make ane of yame king. Alwayis Gillus infla^mit more yair hatrent
tha^ he mesit. And in ye mean time certane armyt men ruschit out of private
chalmeris as they war co^mandit be Gillus, and slew thaym both. Eftir their
slaucht Gillus ran heir and their with piteus cryis, schawin how he eschapit ane
richt dangerus adventure, quhare the kyngis so^nis war laid for his slauchter
and both slane. And incontinent he commandit his freindis (yt stude about him)
to have him to sum sycker place, for gyf he fled nocht in time, he should be
tynt. His freindis beleuyng al thyngis true (as he schew) followit him to the
castle of Dounstafage. Gyllus enteryng in this wise within the castle, and
fynding money of his opinion, arrayit his men in syndry abuschementis, and
co^mandit to sla all thaym that war repugnant to his desyris. Incontinent he
callit the capitanis of the tribis to ane counsall, and began be lang orisone
to detest ye insolence, avarice, and unnatural hatrent of ye kyngis sonnis,
quhilkis co^tendyng for the crown hes slane thaym self. And on the same manner
he detes^it ye bludy tyrany of Durstus their fader, schawand be money reasonis
his sonnis vnabyll for ye crown, and gaif tha^kis thairfore to ye goddis, yt
the cuntre was deliuerit of their tyranny, and ye tresson falling on thaym
self, quhilk they deuysit for hi^. Finally he schew the great laubour, cure, and
diligence yt he tuke both for the commoun well and to have brocht the kyngis
sonnis to concord, quhilkis as tha^ war both slane, he nocht know and be quhat
manner, bot narrowly eschaping with his lif. And forthir he schew how his fader
king Ewin left him governor be his testament, with power to part all his
tresoure and gudis amang ye nobyllis that luffit him during his lif. And that
the commoun weil mycht suffer na damage, he desyrit the administration of the
realm to be geuyn to him, quhyll it war cleirly discussit, quhay war just
herytouris thairto. The capitanis quhilkis war at this time within ye castle
knawand weil his treason to saif their liffis maid him king. Als sone as Gillus
was maid king on this wise to stabil the realm to him with sickir firmance, he
tuk ye a^this of his pepil to be his faithful liegis. Sic thingis done he
partit the tresure and guddis of king Ewin as he promittit. And be that way he
conquest their benevolence and favor Nochtheles the same ambition and avarice
that mouit him to seik the crown, remanit with him eftir that he was king. For
he set his mind be money slychtis, to distroy all the lynnage and blude of
Durstus, that he mycht reiose ye crown but any clame of otheris, and because he
was aduertist that Dothane the son of Durstus before slane, had three sonnis
nurist in the I Will of Man under ye wise clerkis thairof, of quhilkis ye eldest
Lismorus had.xii. eris in age. The secund Cormacus.x. eris. And the third Ed^ir
nocht three eir of age, he went ye nerrest way to ye said isle with dissimilat
mi^d, as he wald have brocht their children to his castle of Dunsta^age, to be
fosterit their with otheris nobillis sonnis of ye realm. The eldest two
arrayit in their best auyse met king Gillus, quhome he may tenderly
ressauit, and spendit the residew of ye nycht in cherisyng their barnis, that ye
great master and bischop of the said I Will should have na suspicion of his hyd
treason. On the morrow he began to common with the bischop and his clerkis
concerning their religioun, constitutionis and lawis. On the third day he maid
sacrifice to his goddis with solempnit cerimonis. And eftir that he had left
certane men behynd him to s^a the third son Edeir, he pullit up salis and
arriuit at Dou^stafage, hauand with him the two eldest sonnis of ye said
Dothane with their fostar fader and brether. For in they dayis ye pepyll had na
les affection to their foster brether and fader, tha^ to their awi^ natural
fader or brether. The oungest son Edeir was in sic infirmite, yt na man beleuit
his lif. Als sone as he began to conuales, he was brocht be his nuris to
Argyle, quhare he was nurist lang time amang the desert craggis and montanis of
ye land, for scho suspeckit na good to cum of his two remanent brether yt come
in Gyllus handis. And as scho coniecturit, so followit. For the first nycht yt
Gyllus returnit to Dounstafage, he slew both their so^nis of Dothane in the
armis of their foster fader and brether. And herand yt the third son Edeir was
eschapit, he become sa wod and furius, that he slew the men (yt he left behynd
him for his slauchter) at their returnyng. And fra the^s he set hes vter
besynes to persew Edeir to the deith, and ceissit nocht, quhyll he was suerly
aduertist of his fleyng in Ireland.

How king Gyllus was banist, how Cadal chiftane of Brigandis was maid
governor, and slew Gillus in Ireland. And how Evvin the secund was maid
king. Ca. xvii.
NOt la^g after ane cou^sall was set at Dou^stafage. In ye quhilk Gyllus schew
be la^g oriso^, that he had deseruit na litil favor of his nobyllis and
commonis for the prudent administratioun of his realm, geuand his vter besines
both to take away al mouaris of sedicion, and to saif it fra dissension and
weris intestine, and fra the insolence of ane oung prince. And thairfore he
desyrit na suspicion to be imput to him, howbeit the so^nis of Dothane war
deceissit (as apperit) be the mind of goddis. For as they ordanit kingdoms and
empire to be, so have they co^mandit na women nor barnis, bot men only of
prouyn virtew to have the samyn in governance. Forthir their was syndry
seditius men and mouaris of discord, the quilkis was necessar to be drawin fra
ye laif. Als sone as Gyllus had said their wordis, he enterit with ane certane
of his nobyllis in the castle of Dounstafage. Incontinent he gart sla all the
freindis of Durstus but any miseration quhidder they war men, wiffis, or
barnis. Money of the noblis (ye stude about him) was rycht astunist for this
cruelte, dreidand to be slane on the same manner, Gyllus seand thaym affrayit
maid thaym consolatioun, for gif they continewit at his opinioun they sall leif
in great felicite in times cumyng. After this he kest his wickit mind ylk day to
more cruelte, that he mycht all vterly distroy all thaym, that fauorit Durstus.
quhen this bludy tyrane had roung certane time with their and siclike inhumane
cruelteis, vnsemand to ane prince, The capitanis and nobyllis of Scotland
assemblit ane army of chosyn men fra all partis of the realm, and conspirit
aganis him with sic prudence, yt this tyrane wist nocht thairof, quhyl yay war
arrayit before him at Dounstafage. Gyllus than destitute of all support and
hauand nane with him bot sa money as war outhir haldyn aganis their will, or
coft with his money, gat ane fischar bait and fled in Ireland. After his fleyng
his men war al oldin to Cadal chiftane of brigandis, and both his castellis
Berigone and Dounstafage taikin. The nobyllis be good aduisement (that this
tyrane Gillus should be perpetually exilit) maid Cadall governor, quhilk kest
his extreme labor to persew Gyllus to ye deith, and come fynaly in the Ilis,
quhare he fand Edeir the third son of Dothane, quhilk was sauit before fra the
treasone of Gyllus be his nurice, as said is. And because the said Edeir was
destitute of freindis (for they war al slane be Gyllus) he was send to Epiak
the principal ciete of Brigance to be kepit their, quhil he war of more
perfectioun and aige. Gyllus banist on this wise complanit to the princis of
Ireland of the heavy iniuris done to him be ye Scottis, be quhome he was exilit
and spuleit of his empire and kingdom. Throw quhylk na place was left sicker
to him in Albion, and promittit gif the said princis wald restore him to his
realm, to gif ye Ilis of Scotland fra the empire of Scottis to be haldyn
perpetually of the dominion of Ireland. The Ireland princis glaid of his promis
assemblit ane army to cum in Scotland for ye same effect. Cadal weill aduertist
of their ordinance, returnit to Dou^stafage. and tuke consultatioun of the
nobillis how the said Gillus mycht be esely resistit. Than was it concludit, y^
Ewin the secund of that name sal be king, for he was nepot to king Fynnane,
gottin of his bruther Dowal. Gyllus seand the sea campis stuffi^ in all partis
of Albion to resyst his cumyng, arryuit in the Ilis, quhare he exercit his
cruelte but any miseratioun or piete, syne tuke with him all the guddis that
mycht be caryit, and the remanent put in fire. King Ewin impacient to suffer
their in^uris, prouidit ane flote of galeonis and schippis with marineris,
weirmen, and other thingis necessar, and send thaym with Cadall his admyrall in
Ireland. Sone after Cadall pullit up salis, and with fortunat wyndis arriuit i^
Ireland. At quhais cumyng went sic confluence of pepil to him, that he semit
nocht only to vincus Gyllus, bot all the pepyll of Ireland. Gyllus sone after
arrayit his folkis, and be sound of trumpet both the armyis iunit, and faucht
with great cruelte on ylk side, quhyll at last money of Gyllus folkis weary and
mate (specially they that thocht ^t odius to fecht aganis their native pepyll)
fled fra Gillus* and randerit ^haym to Cadall. Than Gyllus dispa^it of victory
raif of his coit armor, and fled in a thik wod. Sone after certane armit men
war send to seik Gyllus, and fand him fynaly in ane dirk coif of the wod neir
famyst of hunger. And incontinent they slew him, and brocht his heid to Cadall.
This miserabyll end maid Gyllus the secund eir of his regne, confydyng ouir
mekyll in his tyranny and falset.

How Cadal returna^d out of Ireland lost the may part of his army be rage of
sees. And of the consolatioun maid to him be king Evvin. Ca. xviii.
After ye deith of Gyllus Cadall was returnand in Albioun be the Ireland sees
with his vyctorius army, quhen suddandly raise ane vnmercyful storm, and turnit
all his glore of victory in desolatioun. For the irrecouerabyll skaithis
falling be the said tempest passit all the proffet of his victory. The
miserabyll moderis and wiffis knawing their husbandis and sonnis perist in the
sees, conuenit to the schippis with hydduous spraichis and schowtis. Amang
other lamentabyll sichtis, Cadall come to land in dolorus array, beirand his
handis to the heuyn, and warying fortoun and the goddis, that distroyit sa money
nobyll and vaileant men, conuertyng their glore of victory in supreme misery,
quhais dolorus hauyngis war sa petuous, that every man had compassioun thairof.
King Ewin rycht sorrowful of their nouellis, come with great diligence to
Cadall, and said in this manner. Thou hes brocht to me and my realm (may
vaileant Cadall) na little consolatioun, returnyng with thy victorius army in
Albioun* vnbrokyn be ^^uris of ennymes. Thou hes vincust my ennymes in ane
uncouth regioun* fechtand manly be displayit baneris for the eis of my realm
and common weill. The tyrane Gyllus pump of every vice is vincust, Howbeit his
schamefull fleyng mycht be no support to him, quhais heid schorne fra his body
is brocht in Albion, to that fine that he sal nocht want now (quhen he is deid)
the schame and dishonor that he deseruit for his tyranny in his life. My
aduersaryis ar penitent of their rebellyoun, and brocht to my opinion. Our army
be thy industry ar saiffit but reproach amang their uncouth and strongest fais.
Thou hes left na thing undone, that pertenit to ane forcy campioun, Na cause
occurris to reclame aganis fortoun nor the heuynnis. For yocht ane part of thy
army be perist be tempest and rage of seis, it thou be benevolence and favor
of goddis ar saffit to the hie honor of this realm. Thou arriuit in Ireland
nocht bot propiciant favor of ye goddis, returnyng with sa rich spuleis but
any iniuris of ennymes. And thocht thy ennymes reiose of ye mischance falling
to thy army, it na glore may succeid thairof to thaym. For the stait of eirdly
creatouris hes this condicioun. Eftir prosperity cumys aduersite. And eftir
aduersite cumis prosperity, proceeding be reward of fatal destineis, quhais
affect may nocht be mouit, nor it esche wit be prudence of mortal creatouris.
Thou hes thairfore na cause to lament, bot erar to have thy aduersite in
patience, saiffyng the to ane better forton. And sen na creatouris may remeid
their displesouris bot the goddis (quhilkis gouernis the empire of men at their
pleseir) schaw now ane plesand vul^ with ws, that thy freindis and ennymes may
know the be ferme constance na mair brokin in aduersite, than proud in
prosperity, that thy spreit and curage may appear als invincible, as thy body
is in battall. Cadal heir and this consolatioun of his prince, fene^t al y^
cheir he mycht. Howbeit he repentit sair that this unmercifully tempest (that
consumit sa money vaileant men) left him on live, to se their mischief and
sorrow. Of this calamite falling to Cadall is sumpart rehersit be ye poet
Claudiane and other auctouris.

How the kingis of Scottis and Picht^^ war alliat togidder be marriage. How
Balus king of Orknay slew him self b^ disperation. Of the wise counsall geuyn
be king Evvin to Edeir. Ca. xix.
King Ewin eftir the slauchter of Gyllus desiryng to govern his realm in
Justice visit all the boundis thairof and punist faltoures, and gave to Cadal
for ye faithful service be him done the town of Epiak with sindry other landis
and townis of Brigance in fre regalite, nocht lang eftir king Ewin accumpanit
with his nobillis met Gethus king of Pychtis on the borduris of Brigance, and
renewit the band of peace with Pychtes. This peace was roborat be marriage. For
king Ewin maryit Stora dochter of Gethus the third king of Pychtis. This
marriage was solempnisit be ye bischop and preistis of the I Will of man. Nocht
lang eftir he was aduertist that Balus king of Orknay was cumming with ane
flote of schippis throw Pentland firth, and maid na litill heirschippis and
slauchter in Ros and Cathnes. King Ewin to meit their attemptatis assemblit ane
flote of schippis with sic deligence, that Balus was not aduertist thairof,
quhill he was arriuit in sycht. The Orknay men abasit of his suddand cummyng
war constranit to gyf battall. Bot they war sone discomfist, and be continewall
chais dreuin to the seis, quhare ane part of yame eschapit be fischear batis,
and the residew vincust and slane. King Balus seeing na way to eschape (that he
sall nocht cum in his ennymes handis) slew him self. King Ewin throw yis
victory conquest great favor of his pepill. And quhen he was returnyng hame be
the Ireland seis, he arri^it in the mouth of Lochtie, quhare he biggit ane town
callit Inuetlochtie And maid their ane sicker refuge in the honor of his
goddis, defe^dyng under pane of deid, that any criminabill personis be
abstrakit out of ye samyn. Nochtwithsta^ding quhat sumeuir crymis be thaym
co^mittyt. This town was eftir ane commoun port till all marchandis of France
or Spane for the incredibill plente of fische swo^mand in they seis. Of this
town remanis nocht i^ our days ^aif only the ruinus wallis thairof. For it was
euertit be the Danis as we sall eftir schaw. King Ewin biggit ane other town on
ye river of Nes quhilk is it namyt Innernes, qu^air su^ time was great repair of

Ilis be maruellus wisdom. For he detestit ay civil weris als weill quhen he
was in private as i^ publik (...) Schort time before his deith he past. to Epiak
to agree the sonnis of Cadall, quhilkis fell in great contention after their
faderes deith for his riches and guddis. Nochtheles this nobyll prince aggreit
thaym sone after his cumyng. And after that he had done the obsequies for
Cadall efferyng to the gyse of they dayis, he gart raise ane huge stane grauyn
to the quik image of Cadall upon ane hie mo^, and co^mandit the pepyll to offer
him wine and sens, for our forebearis war dissauit als weil as other pepyl in
their arrouris. King Ewin sorrowful of the deith of Cadall fell in heavy
infirmite, and was sa dispari^ of his heill, that he resignit ye crown to Edeir
the third nepote of king Durstus, for he was just h^rytoure to the crown as we
have schawin. And to that fine that Edeir should be ane good king, he counsalit
him to defend his liegis and subdittis fra all iniuris, and to do na man
iniure, and to geif na man office nor auctoryte that is ennyme to Justice, and
to dres all great materis be him self, and the small materis to commit to his
nobillis. And to govern him ay in sic manner, that he may be worthy to regne
above his subdittis, and neuir to move battall les than he mycht na other waris
do. And quhen it was necessar to have battal to yrk of na chargis pertenyng to
weirly ordinance* and to deuoid him neuir of picte. For that virtew was may
semand in ane prince. And fynaly commandit him above all other besynes, to have
his goddis i^ reverence, quhais favor was ane souer protectioun to all

Of king Edeir, and how he reuengit the heirschippis maid be the tratoure
Bredus in the Ilis. Ca. primo.
EWin deceissit i^ this manner, Edeir was crownit in the chiar of merbyl. And
sone after he vesyt all the boundis of his realm, quhais passaige was the mair
plesand to his nobyllis, that he was geuyn to huntyng. For he delytit in no
thing more than in chais of wild beistis with houndis and rachis, and specially
of Wolffis, for they ar noy sum to tame bestiall. This regioun throw the cauld
humouris thairof ingeneris Wolffis of feirs and cruel nature. King Edeir
brocht the pepil to sic tranquillite, that they leuit money eris but any
oppression or iniure of nychtbouris. Bot at last Bredus of the Ilis cosyng to
Gyllus before rehersit arriuit with money schyppis and galeonis in Argyle to
revenge the slauchter of the said Gyllus and other his freindis slane in
Ireland. The pepyll impacient to suffer the heirschippis and slauchter be him
maid complaynit to king Edeir quhylk was huntand on the nixt montanis for the
time. King Edeir aduertist heirof past that same nycht with ane cumpany of
chosyn me^ to ye sees quhair the said Bredus was arriuit. And first he brint
all their schyppis and gaileonis that they mycht have na refuge to fle in
Ireland. On the nixt morrow king Edeir persewit this Bredus and his complicis
with sic manheid, that they war finaly taken and put to detth. Sic thyngis done
king Edeir past in the Ilis quhare he punyst syndry conspiratouris that
followit the opinioun of Gyllus and Bredus.

How the Brytonis send ambassatouris to king Edeir for support aganis Julius
Caesar. Of their orison, and of king Edeiris answer, and how ye said Julius
was doung out of Albio^ be support of Scottis. Ca. ii.
ALs sone as Edeir had dantit all inuasouris of his realm, he returnit to
Dounstafage. In the mean time come to him the ambassatouris of Cassibilane king
of Brytonis, desyryng support aganis Julius Caesar roman emperor, quhais army
was reddy with may awful ordinance to cum in Albion. Edeir plesandly
ressauit their ambassatouris, and commandit thaym to propone their eirandis.
Sone after ane nobyll man namit Androgeus, said in this manner. I will say na
thing before this famous auditoure in the name of Cassibilane king of Brytonis
(may nobyl prince) saif it only that sal pertene both to ye weil of thy
realm and liegis. Nature the wise mother of all creatouris hes put in this I Will
of Albioun three vaileant pepyll, nocht to ye behuffe, that they should leif in
seditioun, and inuaid other as beistis but reasoun. Bot to incres togydder
under ane beniuolence and freindschip, yt they may be the more strange to resist
uncouth ennymes quhen euir it sall happin thaym to be inuadit. Quha may belief
or traist ye realm to stand sicker? quhen ye Britonis ar distroyit be Romany.
Bot gyf sum man be vane esperance wald traist the Romany (quhylkis reiffis
sceptouris fra kyngis) to be the more plesand and merciful to ow, that our
nychtbouris ar distroyit. Thou may have cognossance be damage of other pepyll,
that this opinioun is vane. The romany calland thaym self be proud insolence
lordis of ye world, quhilkis ar hatit with all pepyll for their tyranny) ar
determyt to cum haistely in Albioun to subdew the sa mine to their empire. Quhat
other thing may we belief the Romany sall do? quhen they have subdewit ws
Britonis, bot with siclik avarice and tyranny to reif fra ow Scottis and
Pichtis our landis, lawis, and liberteis. Quhat other thing desire they? bot to
sit down in our landis, castellis, and townis, and outhir to thryll ws to may
schamefull servitude, or ellis to banis the may nobyll and vaileant men amang
ws. Their deidis schawis weill their tyranny* as may be weil prouyn to ws be
the rewyne of Cartage, sumtyme the rich ciete and brocht finaly to nocht, fra
it was randerit to Romany, nochtwithsta^dyng that it abaid at their opinion
and faith. Forther gif sa remot and uncouth hystory may nocht move ow, beh^ld
the Gallis our nychtbouris, quhilkis (als sone as they war vincust be Romany)
war thirlit to perpetual seruytude. Their munitionis and every manner of
wappynnis taken fra thaym. It is nocht to be traistit that romany sall be more
propiciant to ws Albianis, gif w^ be vincust. Than they have been to otheris
before. For ay ye more incressis their dominioun, their tyranny is the mair
insufferabyll. Lat ws heirfore resist their commoun iniuris with all our
pissance equale co^curryng. Best is to resist this violence of romany in the
beginning. in adventure they grow after sa stra^g (quhe^ their power is iunit
togidder) that they may nocht be resistit. Belt ye thairfore may (inuincibyl
prince) with thy prouyn virtew, to support ws be their thy vailea^t pepyl. Come
lusty gallandis arrayit i^ battal aganis our common ennymes. Defend our anciant
liberte* and have ferme esperance of victory, sen our common ennymes nocht
content of the remanent boundis of the world, be insaciabyl avarice and ^ut any
occasion of iniuris, intendis to subdew this I Will (quhilk is seuerit fra all
pepyll) to their empire. Forthir quhen e be favor of goddis h^s conquest
^ictory, above money vn^ellabil comod^teis e sall reiose our liberte, and
conquest glore immortal both to ow and our realm. Quhen ^idr^geus had endit
th^s orison he was remouit aside, quhill the noblis had aduisit quhat was to be
done. After ripe deliberation it was concludit to send support to Britonis to
resist the commoun ^anger app^ryng. Than king Edeir maid answer to their
ambassatouris on this wise. e desire a thing (weil belo^^^ britonis) both
honest and proffitabyll till our common weill, mouand ws to defend this realm
(quhilk hes been sa vaileantly defendit be our progenitouris) fra extreme
dangeir thairto apperyng, The avarice, riches, cheualry, and pridfull empire of
Romany ar schawin weill to ws be thaym that hes been subdewit thairto. And
forthir we know weill gyf the Romany subdew ow Brytonis to their dominioun,
they will inuaid ws nixt and, outhir thryll ws to vile servitude or ellis
expel ws out of Albyoun. The damage of Gallis and Spanartis (fra quhome our
anciant faderis disce^dit) schewis daily to ws, quhat afflictioun and misery
they sustene, that are subdewit to Romany. It had been mair honest to thaym be
my opinion to have fouchtyn may strangly to ye deid in defense of their
liberte, than to have reseruit their miserabyll lyuis to sic schameful
servitude, We know the Britonis will nocht ^ine their realm, their liberte and
lawis, but strange bergane. And sen our common weill may suffer na danger sa
lang as e Britonis standis i^ sicker firmance, we are be degest counsall
profoundly resoluit to ieoperde our lyuis and guddis in defense of ow, thynkand
better to de vaileantly in that sort (gyf sic thyngis be plesand to the goddis)
than to remane at hame, suffering ow our tender freindis to be reft fra our
landis and liberteis, and fynaly to rander our native goddis, wiffis, and
barnis in our ennymes handis. For their reasonis we will cause our army in may
weirly ordinance to be send haistely to London in support of Cassibilane king
of Brytonis. We will als require Gethus our confiderat brother the king of
Pychtis to concur with ws be band of alliance to the same affect. And we belief
all they ye dwellis in Albioun be respect (they have to the common weill) will
heir ws gladly in that behalf, for the luf we beir unto our natyue cuntre
enforcis ws with inuincibyl bodyis to assist thairto. The ambassatouris of
Britonis rasit in esperance of great felicite be this answer returnit to
Cassibilane. Als sone as their ambassatouris war dispaschit king Edeir send two
vaileant men Cadallane and Dowall capitanis of Brygandis and Lorne with.x.M.
chosyn me^ to London. The cumyng of their Scottis was the more thankful to
Cassibilane, yt he was to fecht aganis the may pissant ennyme Julius dantour
of the world. In the mean time Cassibilane was aduertist that Julius was
arriuit within his sees and brocht his army on land, and ye pepyll fled that
war left to resist his cumyng on the sea camp. The nobyl men (that vaileantly
resistit) slane, and the Egyll (quhilk is the ansene of Romany) prowdly
dysplayit on hycht. Be their nouellis na little affray was amang the Brytonis.
Nochtheles Cassibilane maid yame plesand consolation, and exhortit yame
vehemently to battall for defense of their realm and liberte, their wiffis
barnis and natyue goddis, quhilkis ar sa deir to mortal pepyll, that but thaym
the life of man is nothir plesand nor sicker. Belief na other thing (said he)
bot sicker victory, sen our ennymes persewis ow be na occasioun of iniuris, bot
only be their insaciabyl avarice. The Britonis war rasit in great esperance of
victory be cummyng of Scottis and Pychtis, for they had na little confydence in
their manheid and cheualry. Incontinent Cassibilane went forthwart with his
hale power aganis the Romany. And first he send his horse men with syndry
wageouris in weir cartis to break the array and ordinance of Romany. At the
first contering was two small incursionis be vncertane victory. Bot at last
both the armyis iunit with their hale power, followit ane doutsum batt^ll lang
continewing with vncertane chance. Quhyll at last be cumyng of Welchemen and
Cornwall, sa huge nois raise be reird and sown of bellis yt hang on their
bardyngis, yt the ennymes war affrayt, and finaly put to flycht. The Brytonis
with Scottis and Pichtis (that come to their support) followit on the chase,
with sic fury skatterit but array, yt they gat mair skaith than they did to
their ennymes. The Romany kepit si^ ordour in their fleing, and abaid sa fast
togidder at their ansene that they maid thaym oftymes to renew battall, howbeit
they war nocht of power to resist. The Brytonis wide skatterit in syndry
buschement^s eschapit nocht in their chase but great slaucht, quhyll at ye last
nicht seuerit thaym. Als sone as Julius persauit the chase endit, he gaderit ye
residew of his folkis togidder, and send all ye woundit men to his schippis,
with purpos to revenge this outrage on ye morrow. Nochtheles herand on the
morrow that money of his schyppis war sa brokin be violent tempest, yt they war
not abyll to do him proffet, and dreidand that this calamyte fallyn to his
schippis should be na les curage to his ennymes than discomfitour to his awin
folkis, he supersedit his intent quhyl he saw ane time mair ganand. Als sone as
he had reparit his navy, he brocht all his folkis to new strength, quhare the
Britonis mycht nocht inuaid him. syne pullit up salis within the nycht, and
returnit in France leuand behynd him ane huge pray of guddes, quhilk mycht
nocht be turst for laik of schippis. The eir that Julius come first in Albion

How Julius returnit in Britane, and maid it tributar to roman empire* Ca.

QUhen Caesar was doung out of Albio^ in this wise, the Albianis yt is to say,
Scottis Pichtis and Brytonis partit the spule found in his tentis be custum of
armis, reiosyng of this glorious victory, and maid sacrifice to their goddis,
beleuyng perpetually to be delyuerit both of the weris of Romany and all
other uncouth pepyll in tymis cumyng. Cadallane and Dowall richely rewardit be
Cassibilane returnit with ye army of Scottis, and schew to king Edeir al
thingis done in manner before rehersit. Edeir reiosyng of their nouellis commandit
general processionis and sacrifice to be maid in the honor of goddis. Than
followit sa incredibil luf and kyndnes betuix the Scottis Brytonis and Pychtis,
that they apperit to le^f in times cumyng in perpetual peace. In the eir
followyng king Edeir past to Innernes, quhare he be sindry marchandis was
aduertist, that Iulyus had pecifiit France to his empire, and was makand
prouisyon for ane new army to return i^ Brytane to revenge ye iniuris done to
him in the eir before. Edeir sone after send his ambassatouris to Cassybilane to
schaw the hie dangeris appering to his realm, and promittit to send (gyf he
plesit).x.M. chosin men to his support. Their ambassatouris at their cumyng to
London schew their offeris to Cassybylane. The Brytonis mouit be vane arroga^ce
(yt ye glore of victory should not be taken fra thaym) refusyt to have any supple
of Scottis or Pichtis, and answerit they war nocht brocht to sic febylnes, yt
it was necessar to thaym to have support al time quhen ennymes inuadit thaym,
and they had the same pyssance instantly, be quhylk they dantit the Romany in
the eir before. King Edeir and his nobillis had na little admiration of sic vane
arrogance to refuse support aganis sa pissant ennymes the dantaris of the
world, and Iugit thairfore the nobyl realm of Britonis be proud insolence for
ane small victory to sustene great damage, quhylk thing was weill seen in the
end of their weris. For Julius returnit sone after in Brytane. At quhais cumyng
the pepyll (that was left to resyst him) affrayit be infynyte multitude of
schippis, fled to their best refuge. Nochtheles Julius was stoutly assailet be
Cassibilane, and three syndry tymis put abak, bot at last Cassibilane was
discomfist, and all his vaileant capitanis taken or slane. Cassibilane brokin
ylk day with irrecouerabyll skaithis, and disparit of support, randerit him to
Julius* and gaif plegis that his realm sall remane tributar as roman
province. Cassibilane oldin i^ this manner was co^mandit to pay eirly.iii.M.
poundis of silver to roman pepyl in manner of tribute.

Of syndry message send be Julius to scottis and pichtis, and of their answer.
Of Julius hoif, and of syndry opinio^is concerning the first fou^daris thairof.
Ca. iiii.
ALs sone as Julius had da^tit the Brytonis in this wise he come to London,
quhare he was ressauit with great reverence and honor. And quhen he had
tarryit their certane dayis to refresche his army, he maid provision to pas on
the Scottis and Pichtis. The motive of his weris was, because the scottis and
pichtis maid support before to Brytonis the first time he come i^ Britane. it
before he maid any battall aganis thaim, he thocht best to assail their myndis
be his ambassatoures, quhidder they list have weir or peace. peace. Gif they
wald be subdewit to Roman empire. Weir. Gif they peruersly wald co^tempne the
same. Belyue he send ambassatouris to ye two kyngis of scottis and pichtis to
schaw thaym, yt all realmis be favor (as apperit) of the goddis war subdewit
to Romany. For ye goddis be sindry reuolutionis of time has geuyn the monarchy
and empire of the world to syndry pepil. That is to say to Affricanis, Medis,
Persanis, Grekis, and now instantly to Romany. Few placis ar foundin in the
erd quhare the Roman cheualry is unknown, for they be favor of goddis hes
brocht all realmis and landis under their empire* They have vincust Aphrik,
Egypt, Araby, Ioury, Perthia, Troy, Thebes, Asia, Macedone, Greece, France and
Spane, and now laitly Brytane. Al regionis circulit with ye occeane sees ar
obeysant to Roman lawis. Na pepyl ar in erd yt knawis nocht the name of
romany, their is na sicker leuyng nor honest bot only quhare ye Romany lawis
hes dominioun. For the senate and pepyl of Rome ar the port and sycker refuge of
all pepyl, quhais glore is to defend their subdittis and freindis in Justice
and faith. For their causis it war na little honor to Scottis and Pichtis to
have societe with Romany, and be callit the confiderat freindis quhilkes hes
sa money cietes and realmis brocht to their provinces, so money kyngis under
their servitude. This is the command of Caesar and Roman pepyll, quhilk should be
fervently desyrit for syngular co^modite both of Scottis and Pychtis, les than
they will be rebelland to the goddis, quhilkis hes determit to bring the hale
world under roman empire. King Edeir and his noblis herand these message
understood the colorit dissait of Romany. And thairfore maid answer sayng,
they wald defend their wiffis, children, la^dis and liberteis, with all ye power
they mycht to the vter end of their lif, and ^rar to ieoperde thaym to may
dangerus battall, than to leif in servitude. The fame of Romany was nocht
knawin to thaym, bot in sa far as they war repute above ingyne of man may
auaricious theiffis, and reiffaris of realms, depriving kyngis be feneit
causis and slichtis, and subdewyng fre pepyll be iniust dattall to servitude.
Forthir gif the Romany mouit but occasyon of iniuris bot only of corruppit
malice hapnit to invade thaym be iniust battal. They tuke the goddis (quhilkis
ar punyssaris of iniuris done to innocent pepyll) in wytnes, to fecht to ye
deith for defense of their la^dis, quhill ane of thaym war left on life. The
ambassatouris hauand siclike answer of the Pichtis, returnit in Britane. Quhen
Julius had herd this answer of Scottis and Pychtis, he send to thaym his secund
message with mair dispiteful charges tha^ before, as after followis. The great
caesar Roman counsull persuadis the king Edere and ow Scottis, to submit ow to
Romany ye may pissant pepyll of ye world, in adu^ture e bring our self be
imprudent fechtyng to vter exterminioun. Take exempyll be irrecouerabyll
scaithis falling to vthir pepyl for their vane rebellion. Behald ye majesty of
Roman pepil, consider ye magnitude of their name. Will e assail thaym with
chance of battall, as the Britonis our nychtbouris hes laitly done, quhilkes be
fuliche b^rgane ar outhir slane or taken, and brocht to perpetual servitude.
Quhat pissance have e in respect of Romany the concreouris of the world? Have
e that vane confidence that Romany the dantouris of all pepyll may be vincust
be ow ye hynmaist pepyl thairof, or belief e yt the world may be deliuerit fra
servitude of romany be ow? may our power (quhilkis is nocht in respect of
Romany) restore the empire of sa money kyngis dystroyit. Know e nocht yt their
is money Roman campionis, na les active tha^ Caesar both in wisdom, ma^heid,
and cheualry, quhais illuster deidis hes decorit all regionis quhare the son
schynis. And it it is more difficil to vincus Caesar him allone, than to vincus
all the world. How is this presumptuous folly cumyn to ow? contempne ^ the
goddis? quhilkis be their propicia^t favor to romany hes ordanit all regionis
to be to thaym subdewit. Belief e the Romany will be sa irkit be straitnes of
our craggis, mo^tanis, or marressis, or be p^nurite of vittallis? that they may
nocht abide in our regionis. Belief e to be sicker in our said montanis with
our guddis? e ar dissauit gyf sic bane confidence be in ow. For sic
impedimentis sal move na mair the Romany fra thar purpos, than our rowmys war
plentuous, and full of every frutis necessar to sustene their weris. For ye
Romany hes experience above ingyne of man in cheualry. Sa agill of their
bodyis, that they may dant all thortour and difficill gatis. Swift of rynk, and
reddy to every kind of Ieoparde. Of skars meit and sleip, and accustumat with
every danger yt may occur in battall, and sa provident that they sall cause
vittallis (gyf neid beis) to be brocht to thaym out of all regionis adiace^t.
For Caesar hes ane ripe wit for every cais that may occur. Heirfore (gif e
have any regard to our weill) gyf e be prudent eschew warly, that e by fuliche
and vnprudent bergane bring nocht our self, our wiffis, frendis, and barnis to
Irrecouerable damage. e may have now honest co^ditionis of peace before the
victory, quhilk e sal nocht obtene quhen e be force of battal ar randerit. For
than sall e for our rebellioun be reft both of our landis and honouris. And
finaly be brocht to sic disperatioun, that e sall neuir have esperance to
recover our liberte. Als sone as their wourdes war said sic fury and noys raise
amang ye Scottis (for they war impacient of servitude) yt their ambassatouris
had been may cruelly slane, war nocht the law of pepill (quhilk our
forbearis had ay i^ may reverence) saffit yame Nochtheles answer was maid to
thaym be Cadallane in the kyngis name as followis. Suppois the Scottis be sum
opinionis ar repute nocht circumspect bot of fuliche and dull ingyne. it they
ar nocht mouit mair be Cesaris plesand and disfaitfull wourdis, than be his
awful minassyng, to lose their landis and liberteis but extreme Ieopardie of
battall. For they ar nocht in use to obey tyranis and reuaris of realms and
kingdoms, bot only to obey thayr native prince. And yairfore be degest
auisement and counsall, they ar profou^dly resoluit to have na amite nor
alliance with Romany, because yair fair wourdis ar nocht but hyd treason and
falset. And as to their wrangus and iniust weris, they have the same in plane
diffiance committing thaym in their Just actioun to the protection of goddis.
Julius rycht commouit at this answer maid his ordinance but tarry to dant thayr
rebellion. In the mean time he gatte lettris fra Labienus his admiral, that
Norma^dis and Piccardis (quhilkis war pecifyit at his departing) war rebellit.
Attoure Carnutes hes rasit great truble in France, and has slane ane man namyt
Transegerius, quhilk was chosin be Romany to be king of France, and to hald
the same under ye empire of Romany. Julius for feir of this nouellis left his
coming in Scotland, and because vittallis war skant in his army, and na
apperance of new vittallis to cum in Britane (for it was ye winter season quhen
tempestuus seis sufferis na passage of marchandis) he gaderit the residew of
his army togidder, and returnit in France leuand behynd him Britane tributar to
his empire, and the Scottis litill abasit of his weris. This history of the
cummyng of Caesar in Britan^ and subdewing of it to his empire, nocht far
discorda^t fra ye wourdis of his commentaris, ar drawin be ws out of Uerimond,
Campbell, and other authouris. Bot it is said in our vulgar croniclis, that
Julius come to the Calle^dare wod, and kest down Camelon the principal ciete
of Pichtis, after that the samyn was randerit to him. Syne left behynd him
nocht far fra Carron ane round house of square stanis.xxiiii. cubitis of hecht,
and.xii. cubitis of breid, to be ane memory of his cumyng to y^ place. Otheres
sayis he vsit this house (as his tent) in all his viage, and had it ay tursit
with him. And for ye cause it was callit Julius hoif. it because na famous
authouris makkis mention of any weris led be Julius aganis the Scottis and
Pychtis, We lat thaym pas, and will infer na thing in this work, bot it only
yt may not be repreuit. As to this house of Julius it is round, as we may it se,
hauand na wyndois, bot above in manner of ye anciant tempillis, quhilkis ar it
seen in Rome with benkis of s^ane round about within. The pauement hes been of
aselar stanis. and the Egyll (quhyik is ye roman ansene) craftily in it
ingrauyn. Bot now be roust of eris is worn away. In it was ane huge stane
standand to the south, on quhylk the gentilis maid their sacrifice. Utheris
authouris wryttis, this tempyll was biggit be Uespasiane in honor of Claudius
emperor and the gods Uictory, as the tytyll thairof schew. Bot it was cassin
down be Edward ye first king of Ingland of yt name. As we will schaw mair
largely heir after.

How the tratour Murket, and his co^plicis war punist, of the deith of king
Edeir, of the vicious king Evvin the third, and of his lavvis and deith. Ca. v.
SOne after that this dyffiance was send to Julius, king Edeir assemblyt ane
army from all boundis of his realm to resist ye romany. For he knew nocht
the impediment of Julius weris. And in ye mean time (quhen he was gaderit on
this wise) come Murket, quhylk was nepote to Gyllus before rehersit, and arriuit
with money galeonis in the Ilis, and slew their both wiffis barnis and agit
personis but any resistance. For all fensabyll me^ (as said is) war drawin out
of they boundis be king Edeir. Als sone as Edeir was aduertist thairof, he send
Cadallane capitane of Brigance with ane band of army^ men in the Ilis. quhylk
sone after his cumyng brynt all the galeonis and ba^tis within the nycht that
pertenit to this Murket. And on the morrow he tuke this Murket, and hinggit him
with his complicis on ye gallous. King Edeir leuit ye residew of his dayis but
any uncouth or domistik weris. And deceissit at Dou^stafage the.xlviii. eir of
his regne, the.xxvi. eir of the empire of August emperor, fra the beginning of
ye world.v.M.C.lxxxiii. eris. His body was burnt in Dounstafage and about his
sepulture war rasit money hie pillaris in memory of his nobyl deidis. This Edeir
for his syngulare virtew my^ht have been callit ane happy prince both leuand
and deid, war nocht he left his son Ewin the third of that name, y^ may
vicius man in erd, heritoure to the crown. This Ewin eftir deith of his fader
was maid king and was beleuit be ylk man to have followit the futesteppis of
his fader. Nochtheles fra he was declarit king, he began to burgeon in every
kind of vi^e, so effeminat and soupit in just, that he past above the common
insolence of outh. He had ane hundredth concuvinis chosyn of the nobillest
matronis and virginis of his cuntre. And thocht he was Irkit of so surfeit
noumer, it he couth neuir be saciat. And be persuasioun of lymmers and
harlottis quhilkis he maid up of nocht for assistance to his vice, he banyst
ane certane of his nobillis, and otheris slew be hyd wachyng, to ye fine he
mycht the more esaly waik to his lust. And set his mind to sla or banis be
feneit causis all thaym that haitit his vice. This abominable tyrane geuyn on
this wise to may terribill cruelteis enuennomit the cuntre.vi. eris with na les
infelicite pan schame be counsall of certane diffamit creaturis, quhilkis in
hop of proffet extollit and louit all his governance. Schortlie this tyrane
become sa auaritius and unthankful but any reverence of the lawis of goddis,
or men that he spuleit his seruitouris of al their landis, riches, and gudis
that they conquest under him. And finalie he grew in sic blind fury, yat he
nurist opinle within house theiffis to make reiffis and heirschippis in ye cuntre
but any punitioun. And tuk ane large part thairof for his assistence. And
beside their and money other thyngis unworthy to be reheirsit, he maid lawis,
that his liegis sal have als money wyffis as they pleis efferyng to their
guddis. Ane other law he maid that wyffis of the commonis sal be fre to the
nobillis. And the lord of the ground sall have the madinheid of all virginis
dwelling on the same. And thocht ye first two lawis was reuokit eftir be
counsall, it this last law was sa plesand to ye oung nobillis, that it couth
neuir be abrogat, quhill the time of king Malcolme Cammore and his blist queen
Sanct Margaret, quhilkis thocht the samyn sa iniurius both to god and man that
they solistit ye nobillis to reuoik the said law. Takand thairfore ane goldin
penny callit the marchetis, quhilk is it payit to the lord of the ground quhen
virginis ar to be maryit in redemption of their honor and chaistite. Bot we
will return to Ewin, quhais horribill vices was sa dreuin in every mannis eir,
that the nobillis thoch^ this effeminat monstoure that was geuyn to sic cruelte
and vices unworthy to be their prince, and maid yair fore ane haiste
co^spiratioun aganys him. Ewin nochtwithstandyng yis conspiratioun come with
displayit baner to the field with ane certane evil arrayit me^. Nochtheles he
was sone vincust and taken. Eftir lang co^sultation it was co^ma^dit be ye
nobillis yat he salbe degradit of his kingdom, and remane in perpetual prison.
It was ordanit als that Cadallane during his life salbe governor. Bot in the
first nycht that he was put in preson, he was slane be ane oung child. Quhilk
traistit (because he was odious to the pepill) to get reward for his slauchter.
Bot on the morrow this child was Iustifyit in presence of money pepil. This end
maid the unhappy tyrane king Ewin, and deceissit the.vii. eir of hes regne but
any airis of his body, the xxxii. eir of the empire of August.

Of king Metellane. Of the natiuite of Crist our saluiour, of the great fouth of
poetis, oratouris, and philosophouris, that flurisit i^ his time. Ca. vi.
EFtir ye deith of king Ewin, the nobillis chesit Metellane (quhilk was nepote
to king Edeir gottin be hes brodir Carro^) to be king. Yis Metellane was ye
may humyll prince yt rang above ye scottis to his days, hauand na uncouth nor
domistik weris during his time, and gouernyt all materis both at hame and a
fe^d with great felicite. He was ane merciful prince to his subditis, and rycht
religious eftir ye rite of they dayis. He tuk great labouris to abrogat the
cursyt lawis of king Ewin. Nochttheles he was so faschit be Inopertune
solicitation of his nobillis, specially they that war geuyn to their lust, that
he was constranit to desist. About this time come ambassatouris of Romany to
Kymbalyne king (...) Britonis, thankand him of his perseverance in peace and
amyte with the senate and pepill of Rome. And schew to him that ye hail world
was that time in peace with more tranquillite than euir was seen in any time
before. And exhortyt the Brito^is thairfore be example of other pepill to keip
peace and concord ama^g thaym but occasioun of any civil or uncouth weris. For
sic doyngis pertenit both to the felicite of August empriour and all other
pepill. Their same ambassatouris come sone eftir to king Metellane with siclike
exhortatioun. King Metellane heira^d be narratioun of their ambassatouris that
the farrest pepill of the orie^t secht amyte of the Romany. And send syndry
goldin crownis to August emprioure. He thocht he wald nocht be so vnplesand to
co^tempne the majesty and magnitude of roman pepill. And send thairfore with
their ambassatouris sindry rich iowellis to be offerit to August empr^oure and
other Roman goddis in ye capitol. Be this way king Metellane conquest sicker
amyte of Romany quhilk money eris eftir indurit. Of yis message send be August
to the Britonis, writtis Strabo in his buk of geography callit the discriptioun
of the erd. In quhilk is schawin the situation of Britane with ye maneris of

history.

Of king Caratak, and how he dantit sindry conspiratouris of his realm. How
the britonis rebelland aganis ye romany ^va^ discomfist, and of their massaige
send to the Scottis. Ca. vii.
MEtellane micht have been callit may happy prince that euir rang above the
scottis, war nocht he decessit but airis of his bobody. Throw quhilk ye crown
come to Caratak son of the vaileant Cadallane before rehersit. For he was nepot
to Metellane gottin of his sister Ewropea. Caratak eftir his coronatioun
ressauit the huge treasour and riches gaderit be king Metellane And excedit all
the pepill in Albion in riches. Nocht lang eftir he past throw all the boundis
of his realm. Syne past with ane army in ye Ilis For the capitane thairof was
rebellit aganis him. Nochtheles he peacefyit all truble that raise be his
seditioun, and punist the principal mouaris thairof to the deith. All things
peacefyit on this manner, he returnyt in Albioun. Syne past to Carryk, quhilk
was the principal ciete of yat schyre. Quhil sic materis wa^ ^ressit in
Scotland. Deceissit Kymbalyne king of Britonis. Quhilk in his outh was sa
familiar to August, yt he held ay the Britonis at the opinion of Romany. Eftir
quhais deith Guiderius was maid king. This Guiderius seeing the realm stabillit
to him, thocht heavy that the Britonis should leif under servitude of Romany.
Mouit heirfore be vane esperance to recover his liberte, he conuenit his
nobillis to ane counsall. Quhare he be lang orison complenit that his realm
and liegis war haldin under servitude of Romany, and nocht only ye said
Romany held all the strenthis of his cuntre garnist with sodiouris, bot resset
his rebellis, and wald nocht restore ye pledges that war geuyn to thaym, bot
causit thaym to waist their dayis in captivity and preson. Best is thairfore to
rebel aganis the Romany, and suffer na la^ger their oak of servitude. Ye
Britonis inflammit be their wordis concludit with general consent to suffer na
langer the servitude of Romany. Incontinent they ruschet to harnes, and slew
all the Romany yt war found or takin vtouth their munitionis or strenthis. In
the mean time Guiderius gaderit ane army to distroy all the garisoun of
Romany, before any noys of his rebellion war knawin in Rome. Nochtheles
Claudius empriour was sone aduertist thairof, and send two capitanis namit
Aulus Plancius and Gneus Sentius in Britane, with money Roman legionis to dant
the said rebellioun. Their capitanis at yair cu^myng in Britane, reparit al
strenthis and munitionis (quhilkis war than under the roman obeisance) with
new vittallis, sodioures and vtheris siclik ordinance to resist ye britonis.
And that they should not be segit wtin yair strenthis, they brocht yair army to
ye planis to be reddy for battall quhen their ennimes list inuaid yame. Not
lang eftir Guiderius assaileit ye romany with arra^it battal. Notheles ye
victory succedit to ye romany. Ye Britonis eschapit with small damage be cumyng
of ye nicht. Than folowit money incursionis with great slaucht both of romany
and britonis co^tinewing all the symer. At the cumyng of winter ye Romany held
thaym with in their munitionis and tentis. About this time come certane
ambassatouris fra Guyderius to Caratak king of Scottis, and said in this manner.
I thynk it reasonabyl (may illuster prince) that they that seikis support of
strange and uncouth realmis (as we now do) gyf na amite nor kyndnes be deseruit
be thaym for good dedis, to schaw than the thing yt they desire to be honest and
proffitabyll. For their reasonis we Britonis ambassatouris of king Guiderius
oppressed with heavy weiris, and destitute of all supple and help (saif only of ow
Scottis and Pichtis) ar cumyn h^^^illy to ow. Treuth is the Roman pepyll
(quhilk daily inuadis ws with insufferabyl iniuris) ar sare ^^^ymes, rycht
pissant both in ry^hes and cheualry above the estimatioun of men. Nochtheles
they may be vincust. For Caesar the vaileant emperor be our support and virtew
was doung both out of our realm and ouris. Howbeit all France, Spa^e, Almane,
Greece, Asia, Egypt, and Aphrik obeyit to him. And their romany (that now
inuadis ws) ar bot the refuse of Cesaris army. And but dout they may be vin^us^
to our gretter honor (gif ye goddis be fauourabyl) that they call thaym self
be proud insolence, lordis of the world and ow the hynmest pepyll thairof. And
to dyng their our commoun ennymes out of Albyoun, we desire our support, sen
the samy^ may nocht be done be our pissance, the quhilk thing gif e do in
remembrance of our anciant kyndnes and amite, supportyng ws now in our may
aduersite and dangere. e sall conques above our hon^st victor^ interminabyll
glor^ and honor to ow and our posterite. First because e help ws quhilkis ar
nocht pe^sewaris bot only defe^daris. For na thing may be sa honest and plesand
ama^g leuand creatouris as defend the actioun of common liberte and native
goddis. Secundly e sall deliver our realm and pepyll fra hie dangeir thairto
appering. For the romany our deidly ennymes intendis to subdew ws, that the
way may be the more patent to ow. And sen their thi^gis ar manifest to ow (may
vaile-campionis) gif e have respect to the weil of our self, or our landis
garnis our realm with all manner of munitionis aganis the Romany, quhilk
thing may be esaly done, gif e and Pychtis equaly concur with ws aganis our
common ennymes. For the samyn (as we dare bauldly afferme) sall pertene na les
to our common weill, than to ouris. For quhen the romany hes vincust ws in
battal, spuleit ws of our guddis, and subdewit our realm in form of
province, they will be ye more abyl to subdew ou to their empire. Now is the
time to assail our ennymes in battall, quhill we have strenth, and quhil we
may be help of other be sufficient to wi^hstand thaym. Suthly gif y^ ^lbianis
will equaly concur togi^^^r all of ane mind, they sall draw als mekyll fra the
romany, as they have won on any other pepyll. Heirfore lat the pissance of
Scottis, Britonis, and Pichtis equaly concur togider to defend the common
liberte. Lat ws tak our wappinnis at anis to resyst the iniure appering, and
thocht we war vincust (quhilk god forbeid it war na reproach to ws, for than we are not vincust with ane pepyl, bot with the pissance of ye world. And gif we be
victorius (as our just actioun fermely beleuis) the victory sall be na les
glore and proffet to ow, than to ws. And e salbe perpetually estemit with all
pepyll.

Of Caratakis answer. How the Britonis solistit normanis and picardis to
rebellion. And how the said Britonis war discomfist be Romany, and their
king slane. Ca. viii.
CAratak maid ansuer to this message i^ manner followyng. Had e Britonis nocht
refusit our supporte freely offerit to ow, quhen Julius the roman counsull
inuadit ow with iniust battall* it should nocht have been necessar to ow this
day, to seik support at ws, nor it should it have been necessar to ws, to raise our
army aganis sa pissant ennymes. For than be iunyng of al our pissance togidder,
we mycht esaly have vincust thaym, and been delyuerit of all dredoure, reiosing
our rowmis in Albion with perpetual rest. it better is (as they say) lait
than neuir thryf. It is nocht now to be deuysit, how we mycht have dantit the
romany in time bigane. Bot how we may eschew the hie dangeir now appering. e
complane that e ar iniustly inuadit be ane rich pepyl, richt desirus to have
dominion, and to reif other mennis guddis. e have been subdewit to thaym money
eris, lyffand under their seruytude in our awin defalt. For e ar deuidit amang
our self be seditionis intestyne, and sa lang as e stand so, our common weill
sall never be fre. Forthir our munitionis and strenthis ar stuffit with roman
sodiouris, and our planis ar garnist with their te^tis. We heir als that
Claudius Caesar, and Uaspasiane ar aduertist of our instant rebellioun, and
reddy to cum with money legionis of pepyl in our realm. I think thairfore (sen
e ar brokyn with sa many calamiteis and battallis) howbeit ye haill power of
Albion war concurrant with ow. e can not resist sa pissant ennymes for this
time, les than ye goddis war contrarius to thaym. Best is for their causis to
meis all seditionis amang our self, superseding our weris for ane seasone,
and set our laubour with may crafty ingyne to tra^sport this dangerus battall
on France. To wirk this prudently e man solist the normandis, picardis,
bartaneris, almanis, with all vthir pepyll lyand on the bordour of France, to
rebel aganis romany, in esperance to recover their liberte, and promit (gif
they will assyst thairto) to support thaym with schippis, weirmen, gold and
vthir necessaris pertenand to their weris. e man eik be confiderat with all
pepyll that hatis the romany. And gif e do this weill, e sall eschew this
battall that the Romany intendis to move on ow, and convert it on France. Thus
sall both e and we be delyuerit of all fere of ennymes, and leif the remanent
of this eir in quiet, and the mair abyll ye nixt eir for battall. And gif
their be na way to eschew this may dangerus battall, than think I best to
assemble all the pepyll of Albion togidder, to fecht with honest battal to the
deith, but any respect to our lif, bot allanerly to our glore and honor, for
na pepil may de mair honestly than fechtand for their liberte and native gods
aganis ye lords of ye world. The ambassatouris of Britonis rasit in espera^ce
of good fortoun be this answer, returnit to Guiderius in Britane.

Quhen Guiderius had hard this wise counsall of Caratak, he send his
ambassatouris to persuaid the normandis, pycardis, bartaneris, and all other
pepyll of the sea costis to rebel aganis the Romany, saying na thing was more
abhominabyll to fre pepyll, than contrar their native lawis to be subdewit to
Romany. Quhilkis war ane proud and cruel pepyll, daily exercyng be their
tyranny sa many new and intollerabyll conditionis of seruytude on the plegis of
subdewit realmis, that na manner of deith ^uld be refusit to recover their
liberte, but quhilk the lif of man ^s nocht. For their reasonis na thing (...)
sa good as the pepyll throw all ^^undis of France to rebel aganis Romany, and
sla their sodiouris in all partis, quhare they mycht be apprehendit. And to gyf
the more hortatioun thairto, they schaw how all kyngis of Albion sal assist to
thaym, and support thaym with money, vittallis, schippis, weirmen, and all
other necessaris referyng thairto. And schew how the Romany (quhilkis war
laitly cumyng in Britane) hais tynt all their horsemen. And the remenant brokyn
with sic calamite, that they ar outhir chasit to ye see, or ellis to their
strenthis. The cietezouris of Teruana in Flanderis (to quhom their ambassatouris
first come) rycht desyrus to recover their lyberte, refusit nocht their offeris.
Bot the charge was so hie, that they couth nocht answer, quhyll they war
aduysit with their nichtbouris. And prayit thaym to keip their peticionis
secret. For gif the samyn war diuulgat, al their plegis (that war geuyn before
to the Romany) sall be cruelly tormentit. And to remove all suspitioun, prayit
thaym to remane in Calice, quhyll they war resoluit in this matter. Thus abaid
their ambassatouris of Britane certane dayis in Calice, abiding their answer. In
the mean time Guiderius was aduertist, that Aulus Pla^cius had rasit his camp,
and distroyit all the landis with fire and swerd, that stud at his opinion.
Guiderius seand na way to eschew his ennymes, gaderit all his pepyll togidder
in arrayit battall, and closit thaym with wanis and car^is on every side,
except the part fornens their ennymes, to that fine that nane of thaym sal have
esperance to fle, syne put the wiffis in the said wanis and cartis to exhort
their husbandis to fecht vaileantly for their lyffis and landis. On the the other
side Pla^cius deuidit his army in three battallis, and be blast of trumpet come
sa fe^sly on the Britonis, that they had na space to schute their arrowis. Than
the britonis sla^g their bowis fra thaym and faucht with their swerdis. The
wiffis exhortit thaym with loud cryis to deliver thaym of Roman servitude. This
battall was cruelly fochtin, bot at last the Brytonis war discomfist, and
Guiderius their king slane. Money of all ye weme^ war smorit in the cartis be
preis of thaym yt fled. The chais ceissit nocht quhyll the Britonis war dreuyn
to ye reuer of Garieme.vi. mylis fra the place, quhare the field was
discomfist. This victory was nocht rycht plesand to romany, for Gneus Sencius
with money other roman nobillis war slane. Als sone as this unhappy battall was
schawin i^ France. it maid all the pepyll thairof disparit to recover their
liberte. And so ye ambassatou^is (quhylkis war send as said is i^ France)
returnit but any expedition of their message. This hystory (as we have wryttyn)
is colleckit out of Godofryde wrytar of Inglis historyis, and out of Ueramond,
Iohne Campbell, Cornelius Tacitus, and Eutropius.

How Claudius emprioure come in Britane, and subdevvit Orknay to his empire.
Of sanct Peteris first cumyng in Italy. And of the assumptioun of the glorius
virgin Mary. Ca. ix.
SChort time eft Claudius empriour and Uespasiane ane man of singular virtew
arriuit with money legionis of pepyll in Britane. The Britonis herand his cumyng
war gretumly affrayit. Nochtheles be publik aduysement they send oratoures to
excuse thaym, sayng the offense committit aganis the Romany was done only be
evil counsall. And they wald thairfore not only repare all iniuris to thaym
done, bot be obeysant to the empire of Romany and their lawis in times cumyng.
Claudius than co^mandit thaym to geif plegis for observation thairof, syne
commandit all the princes and lordis of Britane to cum before him aganis ane
certane day, with intimatioun gyf they did nocht, he should persew thaym to the
deith, The Britonis knawyng na refuge, gaif plegis, and come to London as he
desyrit. At last quhen Claudius had demandit thaym, quhy they brak their faith,
they fell on kneis confessand their offense, and prayit him (sen they war
sufficiently punyst be the goddis) to ressaue thaym again to his mercy, and
saif their liffis under quhat condition or servitude he plesit, and maid
solemn aithis never to rebel in times cumyng, and gif they faileit, al
vengeance in erd to fall on thaym and their posteryte. Sum of the Romany gave
counsall to Claudius to punys their rebellioun, and to sla the principal
mouaris thairof, other wayis the Britonis mycht nocht be haldyn at his opinion.
Nochtheles Uespasiane persuadit him be money reasonis to mercy. For ane prince
but mercy may well be dred bot neuir luffit. Als na thing pertenit sa mekyll to
majesty of Roman pepyl, as to have mercy on their subdittis, and defend thaym
fra al iniure of ennymes, for be that way ye empire of Romany was ekit and
should endure be the samyn way to the end of the world. Their wordis of Uespasian
mesit the empriour i^ sic manner* that he chesyt erar to be namyt ane mercyful
prince than ane vengeabyl tyrane. In the mean time he began to treit of materis
concerning ye administratioun of Britonis, and first he maid Arniragus king of
Britonis, that the crown sall remane in the native blude, for he was prince of
Walis and bruthir to Guiderius before slane. He ordanit Plautius to be governor
as before, and.M. Trebellius to be thesaurar, and commandit thaym to stuf all
the strenthis and townis of Brytane with strange gareson of weirmen, to minister
Justice be the lawis, to hald the Brytonis in peace and defend thaym fra all
iniure of pepyll liand thaym about, specially fra the Scottis and Pichtis,
quhilkis were ane pepyll full of cheualry and impacient of servitude. And to
seik na occasion of weir aganis thaym, and gif it war necessar to haif battal,
to haif than stout wachis, both at hame and a field, hauand na les respect to
keip the Britonis at the opinion of Romany, than to e^k their empire. And
finaly he exhortit the nobyllis of Britane to remember ye affliction falling to
thaym be their rebellion, and to keip their faith in time cuming for the weill
of thaym self, their barnis and gudis. Sic thyngis done, ye Britonis returnit
hame, and gaif thankis to Uespasiane for his humanite schawin to thaym. After
this Claudius Caesar desyryng sum triumph of honouris before his returnyng to
Rome, thocht expedient to vesy Orknay the last Ilis within the occiane sees.
the motive of his weris aganis thaym was because they supportit ye Albianis in
the battall before rehersit aganis the Romany. Schort time (...) Claudius
prouidit with all necessaris come out of Brytane with prosper windis, and
passit throw Pentland firth to Orknay quhare he was nei^ perist. Nane of the
Orknay me^ was seen at his first cumyng. For quhe^ they saw sa huge flote of
schippis arriuit wtin their sees, they hyd thaym in cauernis. Claudius find and
this I Will desert, went to kirkwall, and send his scurriouris to spy the nature
of the cuntre and pepyl thairof. And fra he was aduertist yt the same was full
of every bestyall and foulis necessar to sustene the life of man, he thocht ye
same sufficient eneuch to decore his triumph. On the morrow herand that Ganus
king of Orknay was in ane castle nocht.xii. mylis fra his army, he send ane
cumpany of weirmen to sege the said castle. And quhe^ their me^ war passand
forth wart to ye same effect, they persaui^ syndry rude pepyl of that cuntre
cu^mand fra ye couis quhare they war hyd all the nycht, and passing to ye
montanis. Their rude pepyll war astonist be sycht of Romany. Nochtheles se^ and
na refuge, they facht cruelly ane quhyle, bot at last they war all slane or
taken. The Romany reiosyng of this victory laid ane sege to ye castle. At last
quhen king Ganus had debaitit lang time and saw na rescours, he randrit the
castle and was brocht presoner with his wiffe and children to Claudius. Tha^
Claudius pullit up salis, and arriuit at Calice, quhare he abaid certane time
quhill his army were refreschit, Syne returnit to Rome and led Ganus with his
wife barnis and the plegis of Brytonis in his triumph. This hystory of Claudius
cummyng in Brytane is drawin out of Suetonius. Eutropius. Beda. Campbel, and
Cornelius Ireland. The same time sanct Peter ye appostyll come out of Antiochia
to Italy. After that he had ereckit money kirkis i^ Asia, quhare he prechand ye
euangell of Crist began to found the christian faith. About this time was the
glorius and blissit vergyne Mary mother of god taken with body and saul to heuyn
in the.v. eir of ye empire of Claudius. After the Incarnatioun.xlvii. eris.

How syndry princis of Britane conspirand aganis Aruiragus were discomfist.
How the confiderat kyngis come to support their princis of Britane aganis the
Romany. Ca. x.
ALs sone as Aruiragus was maid king on this manner, he repudiat his lauchfull
queen Uoada sister to Caratak, and put her in preison after that scho had borne
to him two douchteris and ane son. And in the mean time he mariit ane Roman
lady ^amit Genissa be persuasio^ of pla^etis (...) gif it hap^^t ye (...) to

get na supp^rt of Scottis. Syndry princis of Britane war rich^ common it that
Aruiragus had (...) his quen^ in this manner* and persuadit him be money reasonis

his ennymes hapnit su^tyme to inuaid hes r^alme. And prait him to eschew, yt he
be rage of lust and dissaitful wordis of Romany, drew nocht him self and the
Britonis fra (...) of their ^uld confderat freindis. Nochtheles quhen they had
assai^^eit him i^ vane with their and siclik wordis, they fand nocht bot his
reason blyndit with new lust but any sich^^o wisdom or honor. In ye nycht
followyng they brak the preison (quhare Uoada was incarcerat) and brocht her
and her barnis with thaym i^ Walis. Than Aruiragus wrait to the gre^ prin^is of
his realm, schewyng yt his freindis the lordis of Walis in quhom he may
confidi^) tuke indignatioun that he had preferrit ane Roman lady to his first
wiffe, as it had been vnleiffull to him to have syndry wiffis at his pleseir.
Howbeit nouthi^ the lawis nor the ^o^suetude of Britane maid diroga (...)
^ha^rto. Affermyng eik the said marriage was for na rage of lust, bot only ye
Britonis and romany micht (...) togidder under ane blude and amyte. Forthir he
desyrit thaym (gyf the lordis of Walis hapnit to conspire aganis him) that they
defend th^^t faith promittit to Romany. It was answer^t be thaym yt it was
vnleiffull to him any manner of way to prefer ane new wif to hes first wif. And
for that cause they war nocht content of the iniuris done to her. Aruiragus
knawing quhat mind their nobyl^is bure to him, thocht best to inuaid thaym but
more tarry, and be advise of Plancius he assemblit ane army of Romany and
Brytonis and went in Walis. The princis of Walis na thing affrayit of his
cumyng met him with ane great power, nochtheles they war vincust and put to
flycht. On the morrow Aruiragus and Plancius was aduertist, yt Darby,
Longcastell, ork and syndry other schiris war rebellit, dredand thairfore that
their ennymes should inuaid ye ^ist partis of Britane, they returnit to London.
Fra thens Plancius had lytyl confidence in the Britonis and send in France for
two new legi^nis to support his army. Syne garnist all his strenthis with new
wageouris and vittallis. Sic thyngis done be Plancius, the princis of Walis
conuenit at Schrewisbery to take consultatioun in this may dangerus matter. At
last it was concludit that all pepyl under their obeisance sal conuene ane
certane day and place, to expel ye romany out of Britane, or ellis al at anis
to ^e. Be the same counsal was decernit that oratouris sall pas to the lordis
of Carlyll, Kendell, and Durame to solist thaym to the samyn effect. In the
heruest followyng their princis foresaid conuenit at Schrewisbery, quhare they
be lang regrait of Roman iniuris lamentit heuely the fekylnes of Aruiragus,
quhilk had more desire to be seruand to Romany than king of Britonis.
Nochtwithstandyng with haill mind and pissance they concludit to recover their
anciant honouris and liberte. Bot than began na lytyl contention quha should be
capitane of the army, for few of thaym wald geif place to other. Tha^ Comus
prince of Walis said in this manner. We may sone gadder (may vaileant me^) ane
greter army of our pepyl and freindis, they may be esaly resystit, sa yt every
thing war gouernit be craft of cheualry, for than i^ sta^dis al victory and
glore of battall. Nochtheles sedition, discord, and ambitioun of honouris, ar
so co^tratius thairto, that quhare they sprout nouthir ordoure nor craft of
cheualry may have place, nor it victory may be had of ennymes. Thairfo^e all
ambition is to be drawin aw^y* and all dissentionis to be expirit. And fynaly
ane man to be chosyn to quhome the remanent pepyll sall be obeysant. Be quhais
auctorite this battall sall be led, and gif we intend to have victory to be
obeysant thairto. And because we are nere equale to other in power, thairfore it
is best to send oratouris to Caratak king of scottis, quhilk is may cruel
ennyme to Romany, and desire him co^cur with ws to revenge the oppressioun
done to his sister Uoada, and to defend his neuo, quhome ye Romany intendis to
defraude of the crown of Britonis. And to exhort him to take ye governance
thairof quhill his neuo war of perfect aige. And they to obey him in all
chargis as occurrit. For the more affection that he have to his sister and
neuo, the more esaly may this matter be solistit. Sone after oratouris were send
to Caratak, and schew him all this matter at lenth as it is before rehersit.
Caratak answerit yt he was more greuit ye Aruiragus had maryst ane roman lady
in destruction of him self and his realm, than of any iniuris done to his
sister or neuo. Knawing weil how ^omanis be vane fallowschip and gyle* subdewis
vnprudent kingis to their dominion. Nochtheles he promittit to eu^ agane ye
spring of ye eir to support yame with his army as he thocht may expedient. The
oratouris depeschit in this manner returnit t^ Schrewisbery. At the spryng of
the eir (as said is) their foresaid princes of britane be general edict
assemblit all men yt mycht beir wappynnis to ane certane day at ork to defend
their common liberte to ye nowmer of lxxx.M. men. And at ye said day come
Caratak and Congestus ye confidera^ kyngis of scottis and pichtis, quhais
cumyng maid the Brytonis sa reiosit, yt they beleuit na thing bot sicker
victory. Incontinent (as was before deuysit) Caratak was maid general capitane
of all this army, and he maid under him syndry other capitanis quhare they war
found of may wisdom and manheid, and exhortit the pepyl to be obeydient
thairto* with sic respect to their singular and commoun weill, that they
suffer nocht thaym self to be randerit to ennymes. And sumtyme he prayit thaim
to remember the manheid of their elderis, quhilkes dang ye vaileant Iuliu^ out
of Albion. The Albianis infla^mit to battal be this hortation come forthwar^
weill arrayit on their ennymes. Als sone as Plantius and Aruiragus war
aduertist thairof, they arrayit their folkis. Nochtheles they thocht it
vng^nand to geif hasty battall, knawing weil their ennymes full of ire and
hatre^t, and thairfore co^cludit to yrk thaym ^^at with la^g tarry, walkyng,
labor and penurite of vittallis tha^ to ieoperde aganis sa huge multitude of
people all enragit aganis thaym at anis, quhilk culd nocht be vincust but
vntellabil murdir. The albianis be delayng of battall come to sic point, yt
they mycht nocht for multitude of people be haldin togidd. For sic derth and
hunger raise in their army, that sindry of yame depertit fra yair camp to seik
vittallis. Of quhom ane certane were takin and brocht to Plancius, and schew the
Britonis be hunger, walking and truble neir disco^fist. Pla^cius on the morrow
maid his army reddy for battall. Caratak weil aduertist yairof. Arrayit his
folks, and be sound of tru^pat Iunit. Followit ane scharp battal and fochtin
co^tinewalie with vncertane victory quhill ye nycht seuerit thaim on ilk side.
Pla^cius on ye morrow seeing yt he mycht nocht renew hes army, returnit to
London, eftir yt ye may part of his horse men were tynt. Caratak brokin in yt
samyn manner come with ye remane^t of his army to ork. And co^mandit al his
folks to pas hame quhil they were new warnit.

Of the message send to Caratak be Plancius and of his answer. Of ye deith of
Geniss^. And how Vespasian was send in Britane to dant the Britonis. Ca. xi.
PLancius eftir yis unhappy batal send his oratoures to Caratak And schew yt he
had great admiration, yat Caratak but any occasioun of iniuris inuadit ye landis
of Romany, and supportit their ennymes, hauand na remembrance of ye great
humaniteis done to hi^ be Claudius^ empriour, quhen ye said Claudius with small
difficulte micht have subdewit hes realm and pepil. Howbeit he abstenit and
exertit his wraith on Orknay. And thairfore desyrit him to repair al iniures be
him done, and obstene thairfra in times cumyng. Or ellis he should be reput
ennyme to romans. It was answered be Caratak, that it was not to have
admiratioun yocht he defendit his nepote Guiderius vndefraudit of his Just
heritage and kingdom. And to ye remane^t points he answerit. It was for na
favor yt Claudius inuadit nocht ye relame of Scotts bot only because he knew
ye samyn nocht possible to be conquest but extreme ieoperde and chance of
battal. And for ye cause he past on ye rude and vnarmyt pepill of Orknay,
quhilkis mycht be sone vincust to ye fine that he y^ glorius and vaileant
empriour ama^g febil creatures mycht have ane feneit glore of triu^phe. For
their causis ye Romany should redres both the new and auld iniuris done to
scotts and pychtis. And depart hastily out of Albion with their folkis.
Utherwayis nocht was to be traistit, bot Scottis Pychtes and Britonis (quhom
they held in may contemption) should be their perpetual ennymes for defense of
their liberte and native goddis. Plancius be yis answer tuk hie indignation,
and thocht it rycht unworthy, that ane pepill nothir pissant in riches nor
cheualry so pertlie sal contempne the power of Romany. And maid thairfore his
aith to revenge this proud contemption done be Caratak. Money other Romany maid
their aithis in that samyn manner. Quhen Aruiragus had considerit ye great
constance of Caratak in yis manner, He tuke ferme belief gif his pissance were
concurrant with the remanent Albianis, ye Romany mycht be esalie dou^g out of
Albion. Desiryng thairfore to recover his anciant honouris and liberte, he left
Plancius and past with all that war of his opinion to ye remanent princis of
Britonis, quhilkis war conuenit for the time at Schrewisbery, quhare he was
plesandly ressauit. Genissa the roman lady (quhome Aruiragus tuke i^ place of
his lauchfull wife) herand the rebellion of Aruiragus tuke sic displeseir, yt
scho partit with child and sone after deceissit. Than Aulus Plancius ilk day
hauand les confidence in Britonis (because their faith was sa often brokin) began
to garnis the muni^ionis stre^this and townis of romany with new wageouris and
vittallis, and send letteris with diligence to Claudius, co^plenyng ye falset
of britonis, quhilkis mycht na way be haldyn under the Roman lawis, bot maid
new rebellion and hes brocht with thaym (...) ^cottis and pichtis ye may cruel
and b^^dy pepyll in erd. And thairfore ye battal sal not be led i^ times cuming
only aganis ye britonis bot erar aganis all ye albianis. For their reasonis good
war to send hasty support to romany, yt they be nocht schamefully doung out of
Britane. Als sone as Claudius read their letteris, he send Uespasian with money
roman legionis i^ britane. Uespasian after his cu^myng seeing yt da^gerus cais
(yt romany war intyl) maid him to bring all materis to beter estait. And first
he callit before him ye said Plancius to se gyf the damage falling to romany
in this battal succedit be his imprudence or sleuth. Plancius for hie^purgation
maid few wordis, bot sufferit his dedis to schaw thaym self. For every thing
(yt pertenit to craft of cheualry) war sa wysly be him prouydit, yt the same
was in sic admyraration to Uespasian yt he fermly beleuit the said Plancius was
sufficient (howbeit na other power had cumyn to him) to have subdewit the
albianis to roman empire.

How the three kingis of Albion mouand vveir aganis Vespasian were disco^fist.
How Vespasian ressauit Aruiragus to his mercy. And maid his landis tributar to
roman empire. Ca. xii.
UEspasian sone after maid his ordinance to pas on Aruiragus and the britonis
for thayr rebellyon. Aruiragus aduertist thairof co^uenit his noblis at ork,
quhare the scottis and pichtis war deuisit to cum. In this counsall was not
deuysit (as before) yt every man sufficient to beir armoure should conuene to
expel ye romany out of Albion. Bot ane certane of every schyre allanerly, yt
their vittallis mycht be ye mair esaly prouydit. Thus war ye britonis at ye day
affixit gaderit to the nowmer of.lxv.M. chosin me^, and conuenit at ork with
two monethis vittallis abidyng ye cumyng of ye confiderat kingis, quhilkes come
sone after with.lx.M. men. The Albianis assemblit togidder in this manner
deuidit thaym i^ syndry battallis with capitanis to hald thaym i^ good array. On
the tothir side Uespasian rasit his tentis, and was co^uoyit be certane
treasonabyll brytonis quhare ye Albianis war. Followit sone ane da^gerus and
terribil battal. for ye Albianis stude at ane strenth beside ane mos,
nocht.xii. mylis fra ork. Always ye romany yt faucht in the rycht wyng war neir
discomfist. Nochtheles Uespasia^ supportit thaym with ane new legion, be quhais
cumyng their curage was sa rasit yt notwithstanding their heavy wou^dis, they
renewit battal. And quhe^ they war persit throw ye bodyis, they ceissit not
quhyll they slew their ennymes fornens thaym. Otheris faucht sa cruelly yt
quhen their hand and swerd was dou^g away, they fell above their ennymes, and
rave thaym with their teith. Nochttheles ye fatal necessite of victory geuyn be
deuyne weirdis to Romany micht not be vincust ye day be multitude ma^heid nor
lang perseverance in battal, be repugnance of the goddis quhilkis had determit
to subdew all realmis to romany, For ye albianis (howbeit they left na thing
undone yat mycht pertene to vaileant campionis) war finaly discomfist.
Aruiragus oppressed with heavy dolor for slauchter of sa money nobyl campionis
wald have slane him self, both he was stoppit be his freindis i^ esperance of
better fortoune. Caratak saiffit with ane few nowmer of pepil went to Brygance.
Illithara king of pichtis desiring not to leif after ye slauchter of his dear
freindis, raif of his coit armor, and was slane sone after unknown quhat he
was. The britonis after this unhappy battall send ane herald to vespasian
desyri^g peace, and schew sa huge calamite falling to thaym be ire of gods,
yat of lxv.M. britonis war left only.vi.C. me^ on live, and war sa punist yat
they mycht be sufficient exemple to schaw quhat vengeance and sorrow cumis to
all pepyl for violation of their faith and promys. Uespasia^ answerit he wald
heir na condition of peace, quhyll Aruiragus were brocht to his presence.
Aruiragus seand na refuge, comperit i^ his humly manner. Quhilk thing mouit
Uespasia^ to great reuth, seeing be chance of fortoune yat he (quhylk was sa
prouit yat day at morrow) was tha^ sa destitute of freindis, yat he desyrit
mercy at his ennymes. Incontinent Aruiragus fell on kneis, saying ye goddis had
taken sa rigorus punition on him and his pepyl, yat he covet not to leif above
so hie calamite. And thairfore he desyrit nocht, bot grace to his son and wif,
quhilkes he before had wrangusly exilit but any falt. Uespasian seeing his
dolorus estait had sic co^passio^ yt he micht not contene fra teris. Nochtheles
he tuke counsall how he should behaif him i^ this matter. su^ gaif counsal, yat
Aruiragus should be send with his wif, children, and guddis to rome (as lauchful
pray) to abide the judgment of roman senatouris, to be exempyl to all pepyll,
quhat fruit procedis of rebellion aganis the romany. Otheris hauand sicht to
chance of fortoune, cou^sulit hi^ to have reuth and not to travel ye said
Aruiragus to rome, sen he was not their lauchful pray, bot cumyng under
assurance of Romany, quhais empire was eikit be inuiolat faith and be no
slichtis on their subdittes. Uespasian be this cou^sal tuke Aruiragus to his
mercy, and co^tine wit him in his auctorite. Syne co^mandit all ye strenthis of
ye townis of britane (quhilkis before war stuffit aganis ye romany) to be
randerit to his capitanis, and plegis to be geuyn for observation yairof. The
pri^cipal man yt was geuin at this time i^ plege was Guiderius prince of
Britane, and son of Aruiragus, quhilk passand with Uespasian to Rome fell in
great infirmite and deceissit. Quhen Uespasian had dantit the britonis on this
wise, he distroyit al their awin laws, and brocht on thaym ye lawis of
romany, and co^mandit yt na man sal haif commission of blude within Britane
bot Plancius or his deputis, be quhom certane me^ war lymit to minister justice
on ye roman manner. The fame of their lawis causit al ye remane^t brytonis to be
oldin to Uespasian, and gave him money rich iewellis in satisfaction of their
offense,

How Vespasiane won the town of Camelon, and discomfist Caratak, of his
message send to Caratak. And of Caratakis answer. Ca. xiii.
NOw was the winter cummyn and causit Uespasiane to return to ork, quhare he
abaid all the said winter with Aruiragus. And at the nixt somer he rasit his
army, and come within the bou^dis of Mers and Berwyk pertenyng to the dominion
of Pichtis, quhais inhabita^tis war ay may vaileant and strangest ennymes to
Britonis, nochtheles they war than sa brokin at this time with the battall
before rehersit, yat they mycht make lytyl resistance, bot war haistely oldin to
ro^^^nis. Utheris (quhilkis war mair nobyl) fled to Camelon, beleuand ye
romany should nocht cum their, for difficill and strait passage. Uespasiane
weill aduertist of their departing, come with more diligence than any me^
presumit, and wan ye said town of Camelon. Amang money rich and precius
iewellis in spuleing of this town war found the armis of ye kyngis of Pichtis
and ane crown of gold set about with precius stanis of varia^t colouris* and
ane swerd with heft of gold may curiously wrocht with in ane purpour scheith.
This swerd was worn money eris after be Uespasiane in all his weris. All the
nobyllis of Pichtis (that war takyn in Camelo^) war licent to return hame on
their pledgis. Uespasiane abaid lang time after in Camelon and brocht diverse
auld capitanis to dwell in it and to leif under roman lawis, instrukand the
rude pepyll thairof in civil maneris. He biggit ane tempil nocht far fra the
said town upon the watter of Carron in honor of Claudius and Uictory, and
co^mandit ye samyn to be adorit be ye pepyl. Quhill Uespasian was geuyn on this
manner to polesy and vane religion of ge^tilis, he was aduertist be his
exploratouris, yt Caratak king of Scottis had renewit hes army, and cumand
furthwart to revenge ye iniuris done to him be Romany. Uespasian little
affrayit of their nouellis, abaid in Camelon and co^mandit Plancius with ane
part of ye Romany army to meit him. Not lang after be sound of trumpat both
the armyis iunit and faucht with incredable slauchter on athir side. At last
quhe^ they had fochtin fra ye dawyng to ye mydday* the victory succedit to
Romany. The residew of scottis (yt eschapit fra this sorrowful battall) fled to
the montanis. King Caratak evil woundit was brocht out of ye field with great
difficulte to Dou^stafage. Throw fame of this unhappy battall money pepyl war
oldin to romany. All they that dwelt in Briga^ce hauand lytyl confidence in
their strenthis fled with their wiffis, children, and guddis to ye nixt
montanis. The fourt day after Plancius tuk ye town of Carrik and pertit al ye
spule and guddis found in it amang his weirmen, and send ane herald to
Uespasian to aduertis him of this victory, and schew yt Brigance the principal
province of Scotland was to be randerit but any forthir rebellyon. Uespasian
reiosyng of their nouellis come to Carrik, quhare he ressauit money of the pepyll
of Brigance to his opinion. After this hauand compassion of ye lame^tabyl
chance falling to Caratak fechtand to the vter exterminion of his pepyll, for
defense of his lyberte he send messingeris to him, saying it was nocht ganand
to him to be any forthir repugnant to the goddis. Be quhome all victory, empire
and auctorite procedis in erd. quhais deliuerit sentence hes ordanit all
regionis to be subdewit to romany. It was necessar thairfore to him and his
pepill to obey the goddis, quhilkis hes taken ane manifest punitioun on him and
his pepill for their rebellioun. Attoure promytti^ (gyf he wald be obedient to
roman empire) that he should remane in honouris as before. And to be reput as
friend to the senate and pepill of Rome. Uthirwayis gyf he wald be repugnant,
and perseueir be vnprudent hatrent aganys thaym, he should be degradit of
auctorite and his people vterlie distroyit. To their wourdis answerit Caratak, it
was na les fury than inprudence to mortal pepill to presume (as they war
familiar with goddis) to have any cognoscance of thyngis to cum. Forthir gyf
the Romany but any occasion of Just battall wald inuaid him, he culd do na
thing les, than resist sa far as he mycht. For he traistit ye goddis not to
be sa iniust, to gif victory to iniurius and wrangus pepil. Forthir he culd
nocht understand that Romany should defend him in his realm, sen they have
socht sa money wayis to reif him as they have done to other kyngis. As to ye
amite and freindschip of Romany, he thocht ye same to be desyrit, gyf it mycht
do him any co^modite. Bot as than it was to be refusit, for great damage should
follow thairthrow to his realm and subditis. Ye realm of Scottis was als fre
to him as the kingdom of Romany was to Caesar empriour. And sen all pepill
that will nocht defend their awin ar repute na les detestabil, than they that
reiffis other mennis realms, he should perseueir in battall aganis the Romany
to the fynall end of his live in defense of his realm and liberte.

How Caratak cu^and with new army aganis romany was vincust, of the deith
of pla^tius, and how ostorius was se^d i^ his place and da^tit ye britonis.
Ca. xiiii.
BE this answer Uespasian tuk great admiration, seeing Caratak of sa inuinsabyl
sperit quhe^ al ye remanent princis of Albion were subdewit. He only prete^ding
to fecht aganis romany, and for his proud co^temptio^ he tuk purpos to put hi^
and his pepill to vter rewyne. it because the passage was difficil, and
vittallis mycht not be tra^sportit in his boundis but huge damage of Romany.
He changit his mind and maid him reddy to pas in ye I Will of Man, liand betuix
Ireland and Albion. And for the expedition thairof he brocht money schippis and
galonis to the nixt port reddy to ye samyn effect. In ye mean time he gat
lettris schewand yt both Walis and ye I Will of Wicht was rebellit. And vncertane
gyf ye same procedit be persuation of France or not. Uespasiane traisting na
thing sa good as to meit this present truble (before it any forther spread)
supersedit his passage in the I Will of Man, and past in Britane leiffand behynd
him ye strent^^^ of Brigance garnist with strange sodiouris and the residew of
his army with Plancius. At his cumyng in Britane the pepill with facill
lauboure were sone dantit. And ye principal co^spiratoures punist for yair
rebellion. Uespasiane eftir their feliciteis returnit be command of Claudius
empriour to Rome, quhare he was ressauit with great triumph. Als sone as
Caratak was aduertyst that Uespasyane was depertit out of Albion, he thocht
time ganand to recover the landis of Scottis and Pychtis, quhilk war reft before
be tyrany of romany. And assemblit thairfore ane army fra syndry boundis of
Albion with all pepil that hatit ye Romany, or desyrit to revenge their
iniuris. Ye Romany weil certifyit of hes cu^ing met him with arrayit ostis.
Followit ane terribill bergane fochtyn with birna^d hatre^t on all sydis. The
scottis desiryng to recover their liberte, and the romany to tyne not ye
landis, that they wan before with great difficulte and pyne. This battall was
lang fochtin with vncertane victory. Nochtheles the wisdom and cheualrie of
romany wa^ the victory, and put the scottis to the flycht. Caratak seeing his
army brokin, colleckit the residew of his folks and come to Donstafage, quhare
he (...) consultatioun before his nobillis tuke auisement, how he mycht defend
his realm aganis the romany. And desyrit ane new army to be gaderit out of al
boundis under his dominioun, with all support yt micht be gottin fra the princis
of Ireland their anciant faderis to expel ye Romany out of Scotland, or than
all at anis to de. The counsal ripely a^^sit with their p^sent calamyteis
falling on thaym be frequent victory of Romany thocht nocht profitable to
ieoperd ye realm to ye last chance of battall. Bot erar to suffer yair pepill
to vaik sumtyme fra battal to recover sum strenth quhilkis hes been sa often
diffait before. Be ye samyn counsall was deuisit that certane chosyn men should
lie on the bordour of Brigance to stop the Romany fra inuasioun of ye remanent
boundis of scotland be frequent incursionis erar yan plane battall, Thus was
the battall prolongit two eris ef^, but any great slauchter. The samyn time
Plancius governor of Roman army fell in Irremediable infirmite of flux And
quhen he understood cleirly he mycht nouthir conuales be support of nature nor
medcine, he was sa disparit of his life, yt he desyrit Claudius empriour (sen
he mycht nocht labor forthir for the common weill of Rome) to send ane prudent
capitane in his place, to hald the Albianis under Roman lawis, that ye landis
conquest before with great difficulte were nocht tyn^. Claudius at his desire send
in Britane ane vaileant knycht namyt Ostorius Scapula. And sone eftir his
cumyng Plancius deceissit in Camelon. His body was brynt eftir the custom and
rite of Romany, and consecrarit in ye tempill of Claudius and victory. Thus
raise ane co^suetude money eris eftir obseruat amang the scottis and pychtis to
byrne the bodyis of thaym yat deis. as apperis it be money signys to our dayis.
For in the eir of god i.M.v.C.xxi. eris. In Fyndou^e ane town of ye Mernis.v.
mylis fra Aberdene was found ane anciant sepulture, in quhilk were.ii. lame
piggis craftily maid with letteris ingrauit full of brynt powder, quhilkes sone
eftir that they were handillit ^el in dros. Siclike in Kenbothen ane town of
Mar.x. mylis fra Aberdene were found two sepulturis on the samyn manner full of
brynt powder. Money other sepultutis hes been often times found on the same manner
full of brynt powder. Bot we will return to our historye, quhare we left. The
Britonis eftir the cummyng of Ostorius Scapula beleuyng to recover yair liberte
(because he knew not their maneris nor country) rebellit. Ostorius desyryng to
have occasion of rebellioun (yt he mycht schaw his proves and manheid) rasit
his camp to inuaid the Welche men and otheris Britonis in the west partis of
Brytane. And finalie put thaym to discomfiture. Eftir yis victory he went on ye
est Britonis fornence ye france seis. Quhilkis war ye principal monaris of this
rebellion. Their britonis seeing na refuge, fled to ane strait ground quhare
they mycht nocht be esalie inuadit. Nochtheles they were finalie vincust. Throw
fame of this unhappy battall, all the remanent britonis were subdewit to
Ostorius.

How Caratak fechta^d with new army aganis ye Romany was discomfist and
maid presoner to Ostorius be treason of Cartumandia his stepmoder. Ca. xv.
OStorius schort time eftir tuk ane castle in Cu^ber namit Carlill. And eftir
(that he had taken great pray of guddis out of all partis lyand their about) he

wrocht insufferabil iniuris with fire and swerd on the pepyll thairof. Caratak
impacient to sustene their offe^cis determit outher to de, or ellis to revenge
the samyn. Money other Albianis come to him on ye samyn mind The army of Caratak
at this time was noumerit to.xl.M. men, and was arrayit in sic manner, yt al
yair bakkes were set contrar ane deip riuere but any furde to ye fine, ye nane

great noumer to visie the chance of this field) set on Ilk side of the battall
to raise ye spreitis of men with their clamor. And to cast stanis at their
ennymes and sla thaym quhen they fell. Al other women (yat war oung and wicht)
war arrayit with armor and wappinnis amang ye men. Sic thyngis done the
capitanis went heir and their about ye army exhortyng yame all in general to
battal, and said yat day behuffit they other to recover their liberte, or
ellis be thirlit to perpetual servitude. And su^tyme they maid inuocatioun to
ye divine spreit of their eldaris, quhilkes be yair man heid and glorius
cheualrie dang Julius out of Albion, and maid thaym and their posterite
exonerat fra al tribut and servitude of Romany. Yan followit sa huge clamor
and noyis in ye army, yt Ilk man promittit (but any feir) to fecht for their
realm and liberte to the deith. Ostorius was na litil astonist, seeing ye
Scottis of sa huge multitude, and brym desire of battall. Knawyng weil how
dangerus it was to fecht aganis any men in extreme disperation but refuge.
Caratak it to gyf ye army more curage and spreit to fecht, schew yt their
perpetual liberte was than present to thaym in yat field for the wynnyng. On
the other side Ostorius was na les prudent in hortation of hes folks, desiryng
yame be lang orison to remember how they were romany dantaris of all pepill.
And their ennymes bot rude and barbar but humanite, and cassin be nature the
crafty mother of al creature in ye remote and last nuyk of ye world. Incontinent
both ye armyis be thunderand preis of trumpat Iunit, and faucht with mair
cruelte, yan euir was herd i^ any world before. Nochtheles the romany were
finalie victouris. In this battall was taken Caratakis wif, hes docht and bred.
and as often is seen, few men ca^ haif sickir frei^des i^ aduersite This Caratak
fled to his good mother Cartuma^dia queen of Scottis, quhilk eftir deceis of his
fader Cadallane was maryit upon ane va^^eant knycht namit Uenisius. Curtumandia
seeing Caratak distitute of all consolatioun deliuerit him to Ostorius, the.ix.
eir eftir that ye b^ttall was begun be Romany in Albion. Ostorius seeing
Caratak brocht before him and re^t fra kynglie dignite, Had sic compassioun,
That he tuke him be the hand and said. O Caratak yis mischance should be sufferit
with patience. For thocht thou be distitute of good fortoun. it thou art nocht
cumyn in our ha^dis nakit of virtew. Eschame nocht to be the pray of Romany,
quhilkis hes subdewit sa money rich and vaileant kyngis and led thaym in
triumph* (...) this answerit Caratak with heavy their. I mon (said he) suffer
this aduersite. Howbeit it be contrar my will. And it na thing is sa grievous to
me as fortoun, quhilk is sa co^trarius to my governance, yat scho hes de^eckit
me at thy feit to be example of her mutabilite, and maid me presoner more be
treason tha^ force. Quhil my pyssance indurit I maid Impediment. Bot now be
treason of my stepmoder Cartumandia (in quhom had I may confidence eftir my
discomfitour) I am cumyn in thy handis. My part is now to obey to the as
victour, and vnderlie ye will and pleseir of my ennyme. Thy part salbe to use ye
chance of ane victorius capitane and so merciful, that vincust and miserable
people may have sum esperance of grace. Als sone as Caratak had said their
wourdis he was brocht to the tentis of Romany, and tretit with all reverence
(as ^fferit) to ane king.

How Caratak was brocht to ^ome, and how ^e returnit in Scotland. Of uncouth
meruellis seen in Alhion, and of syndry nobyll clerkis, and of the deith of
Caratak. Ca. xvi.
CAratak within few dayis eft was brocht throw Italy with hes wiffe, douchter
and bredir to Rome. Ye pepil heirand his cu^myng assemblit out of all pertis
rycht desyrus to se that vaileant king Quhilk had fouchtyn sa money eris aganys
ye romany. At his cumyng stude arrayit in the stretis of Rome ye band of
weirmen in great ordour. First were schawin his horse, harnes, bardyng and rich
spuleis, quhilkes war gottin in the field aganis him. Followit his wif and
douchter, and last of all him self. Caratak brocht before the empreour in this
manner and seeing his freindis (that come with him sumpart astonyst) to schaw his
curage na thing de^eckit in this calamyte. Said in this manner. Had I been als
fortunat in prosperity and riches, as I am in hie nobilite and blud. I micht
haif erar cu^min friend than presonere in this town. For I was nocht unworthy
throw my progenitouris and great dominioun to have been co^fiderat with Romany.
This present calamyte is na les honorable to the Caesar empriour, than vnplesa^d
to me. I had su^tyme horse, harnes, men, and riches. Quhat wonder is thocht I
have lost thaym aganis my will? For gyf e Romany will have empire above ye
world, on force al people man be th^^llit to our servitude. Had I been canderit
to romany sone eftir their cuming in Albioun. Nothir had thy glore nor i^ my
calamite been sa notable and knawin, and yocht thou punys me yt am thy
presonere to ye deith, the memory of me sall sone euanys. it will thou suffer
me return to my realm. It salbe ane perpetual example of thy mercy. The
emprioure incontinent gave pardoun and grace both to him, his wiffe and
brether, and delyuerit thaym of bondaige. Sone after the faderis conuenit, and
fell in syndry communicationis concerning ye capitane of Caratak. Money of thaym
thocht the taking of him na les honorabyl to Romany, than was the taking of
king Syphax be Scipio or Persis be. L. Paulus, or ye taking of any other
vincust kyngis be ye romany, and decernit thairfore ane triumph to be geuyn
to Ostorius. Caratak was commandit to return in Scotland* leiffand his eldest
brothir and douchter in pledge. Money prodigeis and uncouth meruellis war seen
in Albion that eir yat Caratak faucht with Romany. ane great battall of horsemen
war seen arrayit in ye field. And sone eft with huge noyis and murdir on athir
side iunit togidder, bot they euanist sa suddanly that na manner of sign
apperit in ye field, quhare they war first seen. In the nycht before the battal
apperit to the wache ane multitude of wolffis, and tuke ane of thaym that war
at the wache away, and brocht him with thaym to the nixt wod. Bot on the morrow
(als sone as lycht apperit) they brocht hi^ agane but any harm of his body. In
Carryk was ane child borne with ane rauyn heid. Their uncouth signis apperit to
nales terror than admiration of ye pepyl. The deuinouris interpret thaim to
signify great trubyll and dangeir appering to Caratak the heid of the realm.
Nochtheles seeing him return fra Rome but any displeseir, they began to
interpret thaym to ane other face. The pepyll reiosyng of Caratakis returnyng
ressauit him with excellent honouris, and conuoyit him to the town of Carryk.
This town be command of the empriour was restorit to him with Brygance, Kyle,
and Cunyngham. Caratak past the remanent of his liffe in tender amite with the
Romany but any uncouth or domistik weiris. for both his brethir and
douchteris war send hame to him be favor of the empriour. Caratak leiffit two
eris after this in good peace, and deceissit the.xxi. ere of his regne, ane
prince mair vaileant than fortunat all his dayis, geuand his ingyne and curage
to defend his realm and subdittis fra servitude of Romany and to institute
thaim i^ good maneres. About this time was money nobyll clerkis as Persius,
Iunenale, Senica. The pepyll began als in all partis of the world to ryis in
sicker faith of Crist and all vane ydolatreis and superstitionis put down. And
sa endis heir the third buke.

Heir begynnis the feird Buke of the croniklis of Scotland:
How Corbrede was maid king of Scottis. How the Pichtis rebellit aganis the
Romany and slew Ostorius their capitane. Ca. primo.
CAratak bea^d on yis manner deceissit and beryit with funeral triumph in
Carryk, ane rich and precius sepulture was maid for him with hiear pillaris
rysyng about ye samyn, than euir was seen before to hes eternal glory. This
prince had na ayris bot ane douchter to succeid to his realm. And was trublit
with sic infirmite yat scho deceissit ane virgyne. Eftir her deith Corbreid
oungest brothir to Caratak was maid king. For his eldest brothir deceissit (as
we schew before) passand with Uespasiane to Rome. Yis Corbreid was of fers
ingyne nocht far different fra his brothir Caratak in maneris. In ye beginning
of his empire he went in the Ilis, Ros and (...), quhare he punist money we kir
schrewis for their attemptatis. And rewardit all thaym yat he fand defendouris
of ye common weill with large co^moditeis. Quhill Corbreid was given on this
manner to Justice the Romany began to decay in Britane. For the Pychtis eftir
creation of ^hair new king conkist in hope to recover their liberte, slew money
of ye Romany heir and yair skatterit throw the cuntre. For they traistit eft
deith of Caratak na recounteryng to be foundin. Thus had nane of the Romany
eschapit, war nocht they hapnit more haistelie to be reskewit be support of
their strenthis. Nochtheles money of the principal capitanis were slane.
Ostorius inpacient to suffer yir iniuris, come with ane haisty and weil arrayit
army aganis the Pychtis. Followit sone ane sore battal fochtin with sic cruelte
and slauchter, that the Romany were neir discomfist. Than Ostorius ruschit sa
fersly forwart to have maid thaym support, that he was evil woundit, And
narrowly eschapit vntakin. Nochtheles the nycht seuerit thaym with lamentable
slaucht on ilk side. Followit co^tinewal incursio^is with reif and slauchter as
the chance succedit. Throw fame of this victory come sindry cumpanys of pepill
to the Pychtis, and gave occasioun to fecht aganys the Romany. Bot skarsly was
ye battall Iunyt, quhen the Pychtis left ye field and fled (as they had been
discomfist) to yat fine that they mycht draw the Romany to the said place
quhair their ambuschement was laid. And as they deuisit, sa succedit eftir. For
ye Romany following in this manner were slane. Als sone as Ostorius was
aduertist heirof, he fled with great dredour to his tentis, and wrait to
Claudius emprioure. That the Pichtis were rebellit and mycht na ways be haldin
under Roman lawis. Than Claudius maid his vow to punys the Pichtis i^ sic
manner, that their name and memory sall peris in Albioun. And to bring his
purpos to effect, he send in Britane two Roman legionis. And nochtwithstanding
ye cumyng of their legionis, the Pychtis grew Ilk day more insolent aganis the
Romany. And finalie be suddan Irruptionis slew two capitanis of Roman
sodiouris, quhilkis were assemblit before to make incursionis in the cuntre. And
partit their spuleis amang their fallowis that concurrit with thaym in the said
bergane. Ostorius trublit with heavy curis and doloure risyng of the woundis
(that he gat in this last battall) deceissit to the great consolatioun of his
ennymes.

How Manlius Vale^^ capitane of Britane was discomfist be the Pichtis. How
Didius was send in his place. Of the messaige send be Pichtis to Corbreid. And
of his answer. Ca. ii.
OStorius bea^d decessit in this wise, Manlius Uale^s was maid capitane to
Romany in Britane. And com with money auful legionis aganis y^ Pichtis.
Followit ^ne scharppe bergane fochtin lang time with doutsum victory. And quhen
ye Pychtis stude in may danger, come haistelye.iiii.C. men of Kendill (quhen
na man beleuit) to their support. Be quhais cummyng the Romany war put to
flycht. In this battal was slane.iii.M. Romany. And two thousand pichtes.
Claudius aduertist of these unhappy chance falling to romany in Britane, send
Aulus Didius with two Roman legionis to succeid in his place. Yis Aulus at his
cummyng in Albioun ^and the Romany in small felicite, and maid him thairfore
to revenge the iniuris done to thaym. And persewit the Pychtis (quhare euir
they mycht be apprehendit) to the deith. And first he callit all the Romany
before him, and reprochit thaym that they faileit to thaym self. And war nocht
sa walkrif and provident in all materis (as they should haif ben) eftir the taking
of Caratak. He meru^llit eik that they were sa far degenerit fra Roman glore to
be schamfullie ouirthrawin with their febyll ennymes. And finalie he prayit yam
to belief nocht their discomfitoure cummin be any manheid or virtew of their
ennymes, bot only de their awin necligence and s^euth. And prayt thaym to be
so obedient to their capitane, that he have na occasioun be thaym to leis his
curage. The Romany maid incontinent their solemn vowis to revenge al iniuris
done be their ennymes. The Pychtis at the first brut of their nouellis were
effrayit. Nochtheles be memory of yis recent victory they began to tak good
curage. And send incontinent their ambassatouris to Corbreid king of Scottis,
schawing to him. Yocht they have laitlie conquest two victoreis on the Romany.
it the said Romany be more hatrent than before intendis to cum with awful
incursionis in Pentland, and purposyt eftir the distructioun of Pychtis to
inuaid the Scottis on ye same manner. And thairfore desyrit the said Corbreid to
send support in time to occur the present dangeir erar before his pyssance were
brokin, than quhen his landis were so wais^it, that he mycht make na support. It
was answerit be Corbreid yat he knew weill how Didius was cummyng in Albion
with na good mind to him nor his realm. Intendyng nocht only to keip the
landis conquest before be Romany. Bot als to augment the samyn with new
regionis and landis. it because he was conf^derat with Romany, he wald na wayis
inuaid thaym with battal Bot gyf they first inuadit him. For he was oblist
yairto be contract maid before be Caratak Nochtheles for defense of his realm
and pepil he should cum within ane certane day with all his power erar to make
impediment to Romany than to inuaid thaym with any battall.

How Cartumandia queen of Scoti^ was beriit quik. How the scottis and
pichtis faucht aganis the Romany with vncertane victory* and war co^stranit
to take peace. and of the deith of Didius Ca. iii.
ALs sone as their oratouris war depeschit, Corbreid went with ane army in
Briga^ce. Didius heiryng his cummyng, chargit him be ane herald to depart
haistelie thairfra. And allegit it was the province and land of Romany, and
gra^^it but only to Caratak during his life. Certifying him (gyf he were
rebelland to this charge) he should be (...) ennyme to Romany. And ^o^ing be
force out of all boundis of his realm. Scarslye were their wor^^s said quhen
tithingis come that Cesius Nasica lieutenant to Didius was entrit with ane army
in Brigance. Corbreid incontinent gaderit all his pepyll to ane great strenth.
Traisting na les honor to keip his subdittis but perell, than to wirk damage
on his ennymes. Syne wen^ to Epiak to be consulit in this may dangerus matter
with Uenisius the husband of Cartumandia his good mother. This Uenisius was ane
man of hie ingyne. And was lang time defendit fra iniuris of nychtboures be
auctorite of Romany. it because he saw their tyrany and proud dominioun sa
importabyll, He rebellit. And come to the opinioun of his native prince.
Cartumandia queen of Scottis and spous to the said Uenisius rycht sorrowful for
their feliciteis daily succedyng to Corbreid and dredand her to be punyst ((...)
scho treasonabilly randrit Caratak before to Romany) tuke her husband and
freindis be crafty slychtis, and held thaym in preson. Corbreid mouit for these
offense come to Epiak And eftir that he had put ye said Uenisius and his
freindis to liberte, he commandit this we^it woman C^^tumandia to be buryit
quik. (...) cumpany of Scottis at this time followit so unwarily on the chase of
Romany, that they were beltrit about on every side with ennymes before they
wist, and all slane. This discomfitoure maid the remanent Scottis within their
municionis and strenthis so effrayit, that they mycht scarsly be haldin fra
fleyng. On the fyft day eftir the Romany went forwart to assail this
munitioun of Scottis with their horsemen. Bot it was sa circulit on Ilk side
within ane mos, y^ na horsemen mycht inuaid thaym. And it had na out passage bot
at ane part quhilk was maid be thaym with flaikis scherettis and treis.
Nochtheles quhen their Romany knew that the Scottis and Pychtis were within three
mylis to their army, they left their purpos. Incontinent Cesius Nasica capitane
of Romany broch^ all his army weil arrayit to the field and abaid still quhill
the cummyng of their ennymes. On the tothir side the confyderatte pepill I mean
the Scottis and Pychtis went so fast forthwart (quhen they saw thayr ennymes in
sycht) that they were out of aynd or ^uir they come to any straikis. And it they
Iunyt at ye occasion of ye son, and faucht continewally quhill they were
senerit be cummyng of the nycht. And than the Romany fl^d to their t^n^is, and
^he confiderat kyngis to the montanis. In the mean time Didius the Roman
legate send ane herald to Cesius his leutenand, and schew great trubyll amang
the Brytonis in Walis. And thairfore commandit him to make sum honest way of
peace with the Scottis and Pychtis, that the landis conquest before with sa huge
dyffyculte war nocht schamefully tynt. Their nouellis maid Cesius to defaik sum
part of his curage. The confiderat kyngis brokyn with this recent bergane send
their ambassatouris on the nixt morrow to Cesius to have peace, Lamentyng the
huge murdir and calamite falling to both their armyis be this last battall*
And schew thairfore it was sufficient yneuch to Romany to have the confiderat
kyngis as their freindis in times cumyng. For they war sa obstinat, that na
thing mycht vyncus thaym during their lyffe. Cesius hauand this honest
occasioun to treit peace with the confiderat pepyll set ane day to common on
all materis. And at the said day peace was fynaly tretit betuix the Romany
Scottis and Pichtis under their conditionis. The Romany sall keip the landis be
thaym conquest before this peace but any ferder conques. And sall nouthir invade
the Scottis nor Pychtis with battall, les than the Scottis and Pychtis invade
thaym first. The Pychtis sall leif on their awin lawis, and conkist thayr king
to regne above thaym as before, payand the auld tribute to the wageouris of
Camelon. The iurisdictioun of blude sall be only with Romany. Na Franchemen
nor Brytonis (that are fugitive fra the Roman lawis) sall be resset amang the
Scottis and Pychtis. The Scottis sall reiose frelye all thayr landis and use
their awin lawis. Prouydyng all wayis that they support nocht the inhabytantis
of the I Will of Man with vyttallis or wappynnis, for the iniuris laitly be thaym
done to Romany. And finally the said Scottis sall nouthir support the Pichtis
in Britane* gyf any of thaym happynnis to rebel aganis the Romany. Nor it
invade thaym with battall sa lang as they abaid at the faith of Romany. The
peace beand confirmit in this sort, all partyis returnit hame. This peace
indurit but any violatioun sa lang as Didius was capitane in Brytane. And the
saxt eir after he deceissit in London.

How Ve^anius was maid capitane of Britane and of his deith* How Svvetonius
his successour^ put the I Will of Man to Sak. How Brytonis maid new rebellyoun
on the Romany, and of syndr^ prodigies and meruellis seen in Albioun. Ca.
iiii.
DIdius beand deceissit (as said is) be command of Nero emprioure was send in
Brytane ane new capitane namit Ueranneus. Quhen this Ueranneus had vysyt sindry
prouincis of Britane, he come to Camelon, and maid sacrifice in the honor of
the gods Uictory and Claudius emprioure, quhilk was laitly deceissit and
de^ficat be the Romany. Ueranneus rycht desyrus to be equale to his
antecessouris in glore of cheualry, socht money occasionis to move battall on
his nychtbouris. So hapnit that certane hieland theuis of Scotland tuke ane
pray of guddis out of the Pychtis landis. Ueranneus traistyng yis sufficient
occasioun to move battall, ^ocht na redres be reasoun of ye peace afo^e
contrakkit. Bot send ane multi^^de of pepyll but any mair tarry in the landis of
Scottis. And be frequent incursionis brocht away ane great pray of men and
guddis with thaym in Pentland. The Scottis mouit be this outrage ruschit
haistely to harnes. Followit ythand heirschippis and s^a^chter on ^thir side.
And in the myddis of this trubyll Ueranneus deceissit. His last wourdis war sa
full of vane arrogance and glore (as wrytis Tacitus) that he beleuit him self
sufficient (gyf he had leiffit two eris mair tha^ he did) to have subdewit all
the boundis of Albion to Roman empire. After his deceis Swetonius ane humyll
man was send in his place, quhylk after his cuming renewit peace with Albianis.
And quhen he had reparit all iniuris quhare they complanit, he maid him (...)
to pas on ye I Will of Man, for it (...) full of vaileant pepyll, and general
resse^ to all thaym that ha^^it (...) ^ebellit aganis the Romany. At his
cumyng in the said I Will, he fand ane strange gyse of battall arrayit aganis him
First stude ane cumpany of wod women arrayit in furius habyte on the sandis*
with hair hyngand ouir their ene, and armyt with fire brandis in their handis.
After thaym stude the preistis namyt Druydes, heuand their handis to the heuyn,
and makand may terribyl cursyng on the Romany. And in the myddis of thaym
stude ane band of armyt men reddy to fecht. The Romany wa^ mair astonist for
this uncouth sycht of furius women and preistis, than any terror of armyt men.
Nochtheles be hortatioun of their capitane they went forthwart with displayit
baner. And fynaly both their women and preistis war discomfist and oldin.
Swe^onius after this victory garnyst all the strenthis of this I Will with
garnison of Romany, and maid plane euersioun of all the woddis quhare the
preistis vsi^ their sacrifice in the honor of their goddis. Quhen Swetonius
had dantit the I Will of Man in this manner, he was aduertyst that France was
rebellit. And thairfore to peacyfy this trubyll he pullyt up salis and ar^yuit
in Bartane. The Brytonis herand his departing, thocht the time ganand to
recover their lyberte, and rebellit. The motive of their rebellyoun was that
A^uiragus their last king left his two dochteris and the emprioure herytouris
to his kingdom and riches, traistyng to saif thaym fra trubyll be that way.
Howbeit all thyngis succedit contrar his belief. For his realm was gouernit be
Roman capitanis, and his hou^ put to servitude as it had been (...) be pres of
battal. His wife Uoada bet with straikis, and both his two dochteres deflorst.
The Britonis oppressed with their iniuris and dreidand ylk day mair displeseris to
follow, maid plane rebellion, and socht support in all partis quhare they
mycht. Money uncouth meruellis war seen about this time in Albion. The occiane
see apperit bludy, and money deid bodyis cassyn to the brayis thairof, women eid
wod and declarit terribyll thyngis to cum. The ymagis of Claudius beside
Camelon fell down in dros, and the image of Uictory fell down fra the alter on
her bak as scho had been vincust, the spayme^ said their prodigies signifyit
great damage apperyng to Romany. The Pychtis (quhylkis war in Camelon and
other munitio^is their beside herand this answer) were ereckit in esperance of
better fortoun, and nocht only maid private co^spiration aganis ye Romany, bot
slew money of their wageouris before their rebel lion was patent. The agit
romany (in quhome y^ Pichtis had may hatrent) war slane in great nowmer, and
the resydew chasit out of al boundis geuyn to thaym for lang service, and
fynaly their agit romany fled to ane auld tempyll within the boundis of Berwik,
quhare they war al slane be the inhabitantis of that region. Petus Cerealis
lieutenant to Swetonius desyryng to support their agit capitanis, come with ane
legioun of romany and ane cumpany of horsemen. Nochtheles his legion was
discomfist, and him self chasit to ye roman tentis. The nixt nicht he fled to
Cattus procuratour of Brytane, quhilk was for that time in Kent. Als sone as
Cattus was aduertist of the trubyll ylk day rysyng in Brytane, he fled for feir
of his life in France.

Of the complaint maid be Voada queen of Britonis to Corbreid. Of his message
send to Cattus. Of Cattus answer. Of syndry incursionis maid be Scottis on the
Romany. And of the first cumyng of Murrayis in Scotland. Ca. v.
VOada queen of britonis oppressed with daily iniure of Romany, send her
secretar to her brothir Corbred king of scottis complenyng her mesirie and
trouble, her dochteris deflorit, and her self sa schamefully dou^g be the
Romany, That patience mycht nocht auaill bot only to be ane place to new
iniuris. Su^tyme was bot ane king i^ Britane, bot tha^ rang two kyngis, the
legate and the Roman procuratour, that ane hauand power to distroy their blude,
and this other to deuore their substance. That man was reput may nobyll amang
Romany, that mycht defoule monyast women or make may herschyppis on the
pepyll. And because na thing mycht suffyce to satefy the insaciabil lust and
avarice of Romany, scho requirit her brothir to suffer nocht her, his only
sister to be schamefully dou^g, and her dochteris defould but punition. And
finaly schew how the Britonis for ye infinite harms done to thaym be Romany
war rebellit, throw quhylk he mycht haif better occasion to inuaid ye Romany
with battall, at this time than any other time before Corbreid mouit be this
pieteous complaint send ane herald to Cattus roman procuratour, quhilk was
laitly returnit in britane, co^ma^ding him to redres al offe^cis done to his
sist, and faileing yairof declarit hi^ to be ennyme to Romany in times cumyng.
It was answerit be Cattus, that na thing pertenit to Corbred, quhydder rycht or
wrang war done to Uoada. Als it was ane vane folly to Corbred (sen he was bot
ane rud and barbar man) to seem ^^rius i^ roman materis, pertenyng na thing to
his chargis. Forthir gyf any displeseir war done to Uaoda queen of Britonis,
the samyn sall be ^ikit with doubyll iniuris. For the romany wald nocht dedene
their majesty to satefy the desire of barbar pepyll in any other sort, and tuke
na regard quhidder he war friend or fo, or quhat he mycht do. Corbreid mouit be
this outra^eous answer. maid new band of confideration with Pichtis. And within
schort time after the confiderat kyngis rasi^ ane army of all (...) men yt
mycht be fou^din within their realmis, with syndry Ireland men that come to
their support, and slew ye Romany in all partis quhare they mycht be
apprehendit but any r^nsom or piete. And in this iurnay they tuke Berwik quhilk
was than may populus town of that region. And quhe^ they had slane all roman
sodiouris foundyn their intyll, they kest down the wallis thairof onto the
ground. The inhabitantis of the I Will of Man heirand their nouellis thocht the
time ganand to recover all their strenthis. Sone after all pepyl of Brigance*
Carryk, Kyle and Cunyngham come to thaym, and past in arrayit battall throw
syndry prouincis of Romany, ceissyng fra na manner of cruelteis that mycht be
deuisit on thaym. The town of Carlell was nocht saffit fra this cruelte, for
after that it was taken, all the ciet^^anis thairof war slane, and y^ strange
wallis thairof equat to the ground. The women during this fury war sa desyrus
to revenge the cruelteis done be romany, that they bure armor and wappynnis.
About this time ane pepyl namit murrayis discendyng of Almane blude, and doung
out of their native regio^ be roman weris, come skatterit in syndry cumpanyis
to ye mouth of Ryne, quhare they pullit up salis with their capitane Rodorik to
seik ane new habitation. At last after that they had been lang trauellit on the
wylsum sees, and inhibit to land in France and Brytane, they arriuit in Forth,
quhilk is ane arm of ye see deuydyng Pentland fra Fiffe. The Pichtis ressauit
thaym ye mair plesandly, that they apperit with strange bodyis* to support thaym
aganis their pissant ennymes, and war nocht only discendit of their lineage and
blude, bot als war sworn (sa far as their power mycht) to revenge the iniuris
done to thaym be romany. Rodorik brocht in Pentland with the Murrayis on this
manner went to ye confiderat kyngis, and before thaym lamentit sore the tyranny
of Romany, quhilkis be only desire of dominioun hes subdewit ane large part
of Almany. And nocht only thirllit the pepyll thairof to importabyl servitude
bot subieckit thaym to roman lawis. Siclike ye Murrayis (to quhom he was
capitane) w^r doung out of their native landis, and constranit (because they
mycht suffer na seruitud) to seik new habitation. Alwayis it was ane great
consolatioun to him and the murrayis, yat they be favor of goddis were brocht
in they landis, quhare they mycht revenge ye iniuris done to thaim be their
ennymes. And for their mo^iuis he desyrit the confiderat kyngis to suffer him
and the murrayis to pas formast in support of their people, and desyrit (gif it
hapnit thaym be their manheid and cheualry to ding the romany out of scotland)
to grant yame wiffis, yat they mycht incres under ane blude with Scottis and
Pychtis. Be contrar gif it hapnit thaym to be slane, they tuke na cure of their
deith, swa that they had sufficiently reuengit the iniuris done be their
proud ennymes. Their desyris of ye murrayis were the more acceptabill to the
confiderat kyngis, yat they understood thaym enragit with may cruel hatrent
aganis the Romany, and yair fore condiscendit to all their peticionis,
traisting be yair incredible man heid and strenth to wirk sum hie displeseir to
their ennymes.

Of ye orison maid be Voada queen of Britonis to the confiderat kyngis* and
how scho vincust the romany and finaly slew her self. And of the deith of
king Corbreid. Ca. vi.
THe co^fiderat kings reiosyng of ye cummyng of murrayis on yis manner, went
forthwart with deligence to meit Uoada y^ vailea^t queen of Britonis, quhilk
was tha^ gaderit with ane huge noumer of Britonis abidyng their cumyng. Als
sone as Uoada understood her bruthir Corbreid and the king of Pychtis were cumin
with their armyis. Scho went forthwart to meit thaym, eftir may tender and
hertlie embrasyng on ilk side, Uoada said to yame on yis manner. Had I been
borne (may vaileant campionis) ane man, I mycht nocht have sufferit sa money
cruel and intolerable iniuris as now ar done be Romany. Nochtheles in quhat
sume^ir image nature hes formit me, gyf e will concur with me to revenge the
common offense done to ws all, their Romany (yat ar sa vaileant aganis women,
and sa cruel to their subditis) sall sone se quhat vassalage may be done be
ladyis quhen extreme danger occurris. And yocht I may no wayis deuoid me of
wiflie image. it I sall not want mannis hardyment. Bot I sall fecht formest in
the bront with.v.M. armyt ladyis, quhilkis ar all sworn to revenge the
cruelteis done be Romany. We sall pas formast in battall but feir of deith or
bludy woundis. We sal nocht (as other women vsis) be affrayit for any woundis
taken or geuyn be our ennymes. I can have na mercy on thaym, yat hes inuadit my
freindis with sic odius slauchter and cruelteis. Their odius tyrannis nakit and
vode of piete, hes slane sa infinite noumer of pepill, and deflorit sa money
honest virginis and matronis, that they know nocht thaym self (as I belief)
men, nor borne of women. Arm ow for this motiuis (may vailea^t kyngis)
aganis our common ennymes, with sic curage as e sall se ladyis have before ow.
And belief nocht bot sicker victory. For ye Romany ar sa effrayit that they
co^fide in na thing sa mekle as in yair fleyng. And haist our army with all
deligence in aue^ture, su^ new power come nocht with Cattus ye roman
procuratoure, throw quhilk it salbe ye more difficyll to resyst. And fynaly I
beseik ow to rander nocht our self, our wiffis and barnis, but scharp bargane
to romany. Quhe^ Uoada had endit this orison, the confiderat kings apprisit
her wisdom, and curage. Cattus aduertyst of their nouellis was effrayit.
Nochtheles he come forthwart with arrayit oistes to meit the Albianis. And they
na thing eschewit his cummyng. Incontinent both the armyis Iunyt. At the first
cummyng, all the horsemen of Romany were discomfist. And sone eftir ye futemen
on the samyn manner. Follow^t ane miserable slauchter on the flearis. Cattus
evil woundit in yis battal eschapi^, and fled in France. The Albianis proud of
this victory partit the spule and riches of this f^ild amang thaym. And slew ye
Romany in all pertis quhare they mycht be apprehendit. In this battall were
slane (as writtis Cornelius Tacitus) ixx.M. Romany. And.xxx.M. Albianis. Be
this cruel slauchter the Romany were brocht to sic calamyte, ye (...) nocht
Suetonius the Roman legatte come the more haistelie fra France to their
support, The Albianis had been perpetually deliueryt of Roman iniuris. This
Suetonius come in Britane with two legionis and.x.M. wagiouris of sindry
nationis. And tuke purpos to persew the Albianis with new battall. Uoada
heiryng the returnyng of Suetonius in Britane, send to the Britonis to cum to
her but any tarry. At the day p^fixit come to her ane huge army of Britonis,
Scottis, Pychtes and Murrayis, deuidit in sindy buschementis all atanys
reiosyng be their recent victory, that they had occasioun and ganand season to
distroy y^ Romany. The wiffis (quhlkis come with their husbandis) as y^
custom was in they dayis, were set in cartis on the out bordouris of the camp
to beir witness quhay did may vassalage. Quhen the Britonis, Scottis,
Pychtis, and Murrayis were ord^rit in good array, queen Uoada nocht unworthy to
be noumerit amang may douchty campionis, ruschit about the army with her two
armyt dochteris, and schew her not cu^myn amang sa money vaileant capitanis
only to defend her realm and riches, bot to revenge ye money scham full and
unworthy offencis done to her be Romany. And had na lytill indignatioun in her
mind that the Romany enragit i^ so vnbridlit lust that no estait of virginis
nor matronis were left be yame vndeflorit, and forthir scho schew how the goddis
(quhilkis ar Just punysaris of all wrangis) were presentlye cumyn to beir witness
of ye iniquiteis done be Romany. And hes recentlye punist thaym in this last
battall with schame and slauchter. Because they mouyt iniust battal aganis fre
people. Now restis nocht (said scho) bot only to fecht aganis they miserabil
catiuis that were saiffit be their schamefull flycht fra this last battal. And
yocht Suetonius yair new capitane may exhort thaym to battall. it he may not
restore (sen they ar vincust) yair curage and spreit. Will e considir (said
scho) our vincust and discomfist aduersaris (aganis quho^ e should now fecht) will
e considir our awin pissance and ye occasioun of battal. e sall thynk it
honorable other to be victorius in this battal, or ellis al atanis to de* For
nobil men should cheiserar to de honestly, than schameful-to leif. On this other
side Suetonius ceissit not to exhort his army to battal. For yocht he had great
confidence in their manheid, he requirit thaym to regard nocht the vane
mynassyng of harbor pepill. Amang quhom was more noumer of women than of men.
They were als bot oung, febill and vnarmy^ pepil but any cognossance of
cheualry. And mycht thairfore the more esalie be discomfist, fra they have
prouin the manheid and scharp swerdis of Romany. And ^hocht his said army was
bot of few noumer, the more glore ^uld follow, Gyf they with sa few and
sufficien^ pepill, vincust sa huge multitude of ^arbour ennymes. And finalie
prayit thaim to weild their sweirdis and ^artis may ferslie to the murdir of
their fayis. And to have na sycht to spuleis, quhil the victory were cleirlie
conquest. Eftir quhilk all things mycht succeid to their plesour. Their wourdis
of the capitanis mouit the armies to brym and ardent desire of battall. The
agit knychtes be lang experience and use, had na les confidence in their
ma^heid and virtew, tha^ victory had been p^sent in their handis. On the tothir
side the Albianis confidyng in the huge multitude of armyt men, be sound of
trumpet gaif sign to June. Followit ane bludy and terrible battall. Bot at
last the Albiants were vincust, chasit and put to flycht with great slauchter.
And ye more slauchter followit, that thayr army was circulit on every side with
sic multitude of cartis, that the discomfist pepill had na place to fle. Yt
Romany slew all the women in yis battal but any piete or ransoun. Yis battall
was honest bot rycht vnplesand to Romany. For ye may part of thai^ army were
tynt. In this battall was slane (as Tacitus writtis) lxxx.M. Albianis. The
Murrayis for the may part were all slane with their capitane Rodorik* Queen
Uoada (that scho should nocht cum quyk in her ennymes handis) slew her self*
Both her dochteris were taken, and brocht armyt (as they facht) to Su^tonius.
The eldest of her dochteris was maryit upon ane nobill knycht of Roman blude
namyt Marius. For he bereft her virginite before, and was maid king of Britonys
be auctorite of Caesar. This Marius eftir his Coronatioun went in Kendale ane
part of Britane liand fornens Annandale and Brigance. And namyt that land eftir
his name west maria, that is to say, Westmurland. King Corbreid brokin with
this sorrowful battall returnit with the residew of his army in Scotland, and
gaif to the Murrayis (quhilkis eschapit out of this field) all the lands liand
betuix Spay and Innernes, quhilkis la^dis were callit eftir yame Murray land.
The auld inhabitantis of their la^dis namyt Uararis were expellit. Because they
were ane seditious pepill, and more geuyn to civil weris for dissentioun of
thaym self and their nichtbouris, than any defense of the realm. The Mur^ayis
were than maryit on Scottis virginis, and grew under ane blude and amyte with
the Scottis. Corbreid past the remanent of his dayis but any weris. For ye
Romany were so Irkit with civil battallis, that it was great difficulte to hald
the south partis of Britane at their opinioun and for that cause they persewit
not the Scottis nor Pychtes money eris eftir. This nobil prince brokin with
damage of eris deceissit at Donstafage the.xviii. eir of his regne. And was
beryit amang the remane^t sepulturis of his progenitouris, in the first ere of
the empire of Uespasiane emprioure. Fra the incarnation.lxxi. eris.

Of syndry nobyll clerkis. How peti^ and paul war martirit. how Darda^nus
was maid king of Scottis. and slane for his tyranny. Ca. vii.
Money nobill clerkis flurist about this time in Itale. As Statius, Persius, and
Plutercus. And the faith of Christ began to spreid fast in all pertis throw
preching of the haly apostolis Peter and Paul Quhilkes gave their hale
attendans (as good hyrdis) to instruct yair flok in the sicker faith, but any
respect to riches, or feir of their liffis. Quhill at last they were both slane
in Rome be the wickit Nero. Peter was hyngit be the feit in a place of Rome
callit Mont Auri. And Paul hedit be the werd in ane place of Rome callit Porta
Hostiensis. King Corbreid left behynd him three sonnis so ong that nane of thaym
mycht succeid to the crown. Their namys were Corbreid, Tulcane, and Brekus. The
first of thaym was nurist in Britane with his ant U^ada the vaileant queen of
Britonis with sic courtlye maneris and hauyngis, that he was callit Corbredus
Galdus. For it amang ws al pepill that is componit and honest is callit Galdis.
The nobillis eftir ye deith of Corbreid (that the croun mycht remane hail to
Galdus at his perfect age) maid Darda^nus king. For he was nepot to king
Metellane. This Darda^nus was of sa large stature, that he was callit the gros
king. He was rycht plesa^d to the nobillis before he was king, and rycht tender
to king Corbreid both in weir and peace. The pepil beleuit yat he should have
followit ye maneris of otheris wise kyngis his progenitouris. And because he was
ane lusty person, of fair vissage and body, he was gre^umlie luffit amang the
pepill. Nochtheles his mind was geuin to may effeminat vices. As apperit in
the end of his life. In ye beginning of his empire, he vsit the counsal of his
nobillis, and was noch^ far discordant fra ye maneris of ane good prince. Bot
within three eris eftir he left all thyngis pertenand to Justice. And slaid in
every kind of of vice. And be counsall of certane wikkit schrewis his
familiaris, he tuke all officis concerning publik ministratioun of Justice fra
wise and nobil me^. And gave yame to vicious rebaldis, yat assistit to his
insolence and lust. And had all wise and virtews personis in na les hatrent yan
suspitioun. At last quhen he had waistit his substance and tresour be
assistance of their unhappy lymmaris, quhilkis had na sycht to his honor, bot
allanerlie to yair singular auantage. He become sa auaritious desyryng vthir
mennis guddis but any conscience or reason, yat he slew be vane causis ane
nobill man namit Cardorus, quhilk was great Justice to the last king Corbreid
and had na occasion to sla this innocent man, bot allan^rlie because he repruuit
hes vices. Money otheris nobillis and innocent men were slane be him in that
samyn manner. Their doyngis maid him odius to his nobillis and commonis. At last
he ^^st his extreme b^synes ^o distroy Galdus and his two b^ethir. Traistyng
(because the crown pertenit to thaym eftir his deceis) to stabill the ^ame with
sicker firmance to ^ym and his airs And to the same effect, he send ane
seruand namyt Carmonak* Quhilk was corruppit with his money to sla Galdus and
his two brethir in the I Will of Man. Carmonak instruckit in this manner, come in
the said I Will. And fynaly quhen he had socht lang time ane ganand oportunite to
sla Galdus, he was taken waytand in ane secret place with drawin swerd, quhare
he beleiffit Galdus to cum. And was brocht before the great Justice of this I Will,
and accusit sa scharplye, that he reuelit in quhat sort he was instruckit to
sla Galdus and his brethir. Als sone as he had schawin this treasoun he was put
to deith. The nobyllis herand this treasoun conspirit aganis Dardannus, for
they haittit him before for his inhumane cruelteis, And than may of all seand
him geuyn to the slauchter of the kyngis sonnis. And first they slew al thaym
that fauourit him. In the mean time raise ane man of vile and obscure lynage
namyt Conanus, quhilk was promouit to great riches and honouris for his
assistance to Dardannus, and maid him to gaddir the pepyl in great nowmer to
support this tyrane aganis the nobyllis. Bot at last he was taken be thaym, and
hyngit on ane Iebait. Incontinent their nobyilis come with ane army aganis this
odius tyrane, and maid Galdus their capitane. Dardannus aduertist heirof, and
seand na refuge wald have slane him self. Bot he was stoppit be his familiaris
in esperance of better fortoun. At last he was brocht before Galdus, and slane.
His heid was after schorne fra his body, and borne on ane staik throw all the
army to his great schame. And his body cassyn in ane may vile closet. This
end maid the odius tyrane Dardannus the fourt eir of his regne in the sext eir
of Uespasi^ne empriour, fra the Incarnatioun.lxxv. eris.

How money Roman capitanis for their febyl administration war interchangeit
in Britane. How Galdus was maid king of Scotti^. And how he was discomfyst
be Petulius. Ca. viii.
THe romany about this time began to decay in Albion, be necligence of febyl
capitanis and damage of civil weris. For Swetonius legate of Brytane for his
arrogance and cruelte vsit on the Britonis was deponit. And Petranius
Turpilianus (as mair mercyful capitane) was send in his place. This Turpilianus
at his cumyng in Britane mesit all seditioun and trubyll amang the Romany, and
rand^rit all their prouynces to ane new capitane namyt Trebellius Maximus ane
man of slaw curage, hauand little experience of cheualry. This Trebellius seand
great sedition and trubyll apperand to rise throw lang peace in his army, he
randerit the samyn to ane other capitane namyt Uectius Uelanus. Quhylkis on the
samyn manner dantit the Brytonis mair with amite and kyndnes than any auctorite.
And he was in the time of Galdus, of quhylk sall be our hystory nixt
followyng. After the deith of Dardannus ye nobyllis set ane counsal, and ^and
the said Galdus both rychtuous air to ye crown, and ane may excellent
person dotat with sindry virtewis and hie prerogatiuis. And thairfore crownyt
him in the fatal chiar of marbill. Galdus eftir his coronatioun maid sacrifice
to the goddis. For the felicite fallin to him. Syne gaif thankis to his
nobillis and remanent pepill. And promittit to govern his realm be
consultatioun of the may prudent and nobil men thairof. Throw quhilk he wan
great favor and luf of his pepil. He was of oung and flurisa^t age, and nocht
vnlyk to Corbreid his vailea^t fader. Forthir he was of nobill and anciant
blude of both his parentis. His modir was the king o^ Pychtis douchter
discendyng be lan^ lynage of ki^gis. Quhair throw na ^hyng faileit to him that
mycht conques the favor of his pepil* In the beginning of his empire he set
him to punys ye wickit consalouris of Dardannus. Be quhome the realm was
misgouernit, and brocht to great tr^^le. Sic thyngis done he past throw sindry
boundis of his realm. And maid sic punitioun on trespassouris that he
stabillit his realm in great tranquillite. In ye mean time come to him the
Murrayis. And schew thaym reiosit that Dardannus ye inuasour of the common
weill was distroyit. The cummyng of Murrayis was the more acceptabyll to the
king, that they brocht syndry oppressouris and theuis to his Justice. Quhylkis
war sone after punyst to the deith. Nocht lang after ane counsall was set in
Douns^afage, quhare money nobyll actis war deuysyt for the commoun weil. And ye
wyckit law of Ewin (quhar^ the wyffis of the commonis was fre to the nobyllis)
abrogat and annullit. And it he could nocht purches the remanent cursit lawis
of king Ewin to be reuocat. For all ye oung nobyllis war repugnant thairto.
Quhyll Galdus was geuyn to sic besynes, come nouellis to him, that ane new
capitane namyt Petulius Cerealis was send be Uespasiane with ane army in
Brytane to recover the landis tynt before be neclygence of febyll capytanis, and
purposit to cum haistely in Annandale and Brigance. Galdus richt astonist be
their nouellis (howbeit he walde proclaim na weiris quhyll he war mair surely
aduertist) send his spyis to explore the counsall of Romany. Their spyis
returnit with diligence, and schew how the Roma-war cummyng both in Mers and
Berwyk, with mair awful ordinance than ever was seen before in Albioun. The
bestya^l dreuyn away, the cornis and insycht ^rynt. And ane great nowmer of
Pychtis (quhilkis inuadit the Romany in defense of their awin guddis) slane.
The Scottis richt affrayit be their nouellis said the Brytonis war unkind,
quhylkis wald not aduertis thaym of the cummyng of Romannis, consyderyng they
laitly faucht neir to the vter exterminioun of thaym self, for defense only
of the said Brytonis. Nochtheles Galdus set him to me^t the Romany before their
cu^myng in his realm, and assemblit ane strange cumpany to the nowmer of fyfty
thousand men, few Scottis (that micht ^eir armor) war absent that day. Quhen
Galdus was passand forthwart on this manner, app^ru syndry uncouth meruellis to
his sycht. Ane Egyll flew all day with great laubour above his army, to nales
terror than admiratioun of his pepyll. For it was interpret that the Scottis
should be distroyit be the Egyll, quhylk is the ansene of Romany. Nochtheles
Galdus requi^it thaym to have good esperance, for he interpret that ye said day
should put the Romany to great lauboure. Ane armyt knycht was seen fleyng in ye
air. And quhen he had floyn round about all his army, he suddanly euanist out
of sicht, the lift apperit dirk and full of clouddis. Diverse fowlis fell out of
the air full of blude in the place quhare the battallis after iuni^. Galdus
nochtwithstandyng their sorrowful and uncouth prodigies apperyng sa suddanly in
ye face of his army, allegit that they sygnifyit great felicite to his pepil,
and perswadit thaim to pas forthwart with good esperance of victory. In ye mean
time come nouellis that the Romany war enterit in Brygance with mair pissance
than euir they come before in they boundis, with purpos nocht only to fecht,
Bot be plane co^ques to sit down in they landis. For they had sic confidence
in their cheualry and ma^heid, that na power of erdly creatouris mycht impesche
thaym fra their purpos. Galdus na thing affrayit thairof, thocht to meit the
Romany with sic hard cheualry as he was lernit be his eldaris. Trastyng after
sa money happy chancis falling to Romany yat fortoun ye instabyll gydar of
mortal creatouris sall sumtyme bring the Romany be hyd wachyng to ruin. For
the goddis often times ar seen fauorabyll to all pepyll, that justly defendis
thaymself fra iniure of ennymes. Sum men perswadit the king to invade nocht
haistely his ennymes, bot to tarry with ane few pepyll and suffer the resydew of
his folkis to return hame. to that fine that ye Romany micht be constranit
throw laik of vittallis outhir to depart out of Brigance. or ellis to be
trubylli^ with hunger and other incommoditeis. This counsall was weil apprisit
be ye nobyllis. it money of thaym dred their vaileant pepyl to defaik curage be
lang tarry. For ye Scottis at their first assemblance hes may curage and
spreit, and ar brokin with na thing mair than lang tarry. And for their reasonis,
na thing was sa good as to inuaide their ennymes quhyll their fury indurit.
Galdus and his nobyllis followyng this last opinioun rasit his army and brocht
the samyn on the thryd day after in sicht of Romany. The great multitude and
syngulare manheid of Romany sa often assaileit with frequent victoryis maid the
Scottis sa astonist, that all their esperance of victory was turnit i^ may
drery solicitude. it be hortation of their prudent capitanis, they enforsit
thaym self to new curage. And maid inuocatioun to their goddis to send thaym
victory. Incontinent both the armyis iunit with vncredibyl fury. The
Silurianis I mean the men of Carrik* Kyle, and Cunynghame in the same battall
(quhare Galdus was) faucht sa vaileantly, That the richt wing of Romany was
nere discomfyst. Quhen Petulius was aduertist thairof. he send ane new legioun
of Romany in their support Thus war the Sylurianis ouir set. Their followit it
ane cruel and terrybyll bargane with vntellabyll murdir. For the capitanis
faucht in sic ire, that they pretermittit na thing that mycht pertene to forcy
campionis. Petulius it ythandly went about the Romany quhare they faucht, and
supportit thaym with new power quhare they faileit. Quhyll Petulius was fast
ves^and his army on this wise, he beheld Galdus fechtand with great manheid and
spreit amyd his fois.

And incontinent enkendelit with mychty curage and desyrus to conques sum hye
honor be notabyll and sovereign vassalage. he tuke purpos outhir to slay
Galdus, or than magre his pissance to put him to flycht. Bot than raise ane
battall mair vehement than before. For money of the may vaileant and forcy
(...) amang ye Scottis (...) with perseuerand manheid to the deith war slane in
defense of thayr prince. Galdus evil woundit in the face, montit on horse, and
departit fra the ^eild. The resydew of Scottis disp^rit be fleyng of the king
fled heir and their to their best refuge. The chais followit be the Romany in
^ic ire, that the Scottis war slane in all partis quhare they war taken. In this
battall war slane.xij. thousand Scottis. and.vi. thousand Romany. Galdus evil
woundit on this wise, colleckit the residew of his army, and returnit to ane
castle of the leuynok. The Romany abaid the remanent of this eir in Epiak.
And subdewit all the bundis of Brygance but any trubyl of battall to their
empire.

How the nobyll lady Vodicia inuadit the Romany with ba^tall, how scho was
fynaly slane and her army discomfist. Ca. ix.
PEtulyus legate of Brytane rycht insolent after this vyctory and desyrand na
les to ^ik the empire of Romany, than to succeid in equale glore, to his
antecessouris, rasit his camp to subdew the remanent boundis of Brigance. The
Brygandis be ythand incursionis and lycht battallis refusit lang time his
weris. For it was defendit be decreit of parliament after flauchter of sa money
vaileant Scottis to field ye Romany with plane battall, or to ieoperde the
realm under the chance of ane battall. Quhyll the Romany inuadit Brygance in
this manner. Uodicia oungest douchter to Uoada, quhylk was deflorit (as we schew
be Romany, and exilit be wraith of Marnis her good brothir) to revenge the
pollution of her body and other intollerabyl offencis done to her modir Uoada,
assemblyt ane army of Brygandis and Brytonis with the inhabitantis of the I Will
of Man. And come with awful battall on the Romany, quhen they beleuit na
thing les than her invasion. At the first cummyng of this army was hard ane
huge din and noyis be sound of pepyll ylk ane exhorting other to battall. And
incontinent come sa thik schoure of arrowis and dartis on the Romany, that the
lift micht not be seen above their heides^ Thus war ye Romany sa astonist yt
they knew not quhat was i^ this suddand danger to be done. For nouthi^ knew
they quhat ennimes they war that did thaym so awfully assa^le. nor it had they
sufficient manheid to fecht aganis sa great multitude of uncouth and strange
pepyll cummand on thaym vntymuslye within the nycht. Quhyl the Romany war in
this affray, their ennymes ruschit on ylk side with sic hardiment and curage,
that they brak the trinschis of Romany. And enterit perforce upon thayr
tentis, quhare the may vaileant and forcy campionis amang the Romany war
slane. Thus had the Romany been vterly distroyit, and the Brygandis
perpetually delyuerit of seruytude be Uodicia, war nocht Petulius come the mair
haistely to their support. For Petulius met this extreme dangeir sa prudently,
that he with byrnand flammys of Pyk, Roset and Brintstane (quhylkis he had
preparit aganis sic occurryng ieoperdijs) withstude his fayis, quhare gretest
noyis was herd, and dang thaym be force of rage and flambes fra his tentis. Bot
Uodicia sa craftily exhortit her army aganis Petulyus, that scho often times
renewit battall, Tha^ was the bergane sa cruel, that al ye nycht followyng was
nocht sufficient to schaw the end of their laubouris. At the spryng of the day
Uodicia was discomfist, and her cumpany put to flycht. Petulyus after this
victory dredand sum hyd dangere occurryng, inhibit his folkis to follow any
forthir on the chase. Uodicia prouoket ylk day with mair iniuris past to Epiak
and brynt the said town with money agit knychtis and wageouris of Romany, to
that fy^e scho mycht revenge the iniuris on the Roman garnysoun, quhilk scho
mycht nocht revenge on Petulyus. Petulyus to punys their offencis send ane
legioun of Romany, and put Uodicia and her army to flycht. Nochtheles scho was
fynaly taken, and accusit quhy scho durst pretend sic thyngis above the spreit
of women. Scho answerit scho was their ennyme, and wald have slane her ennyme,
and laikit na good will, howbeit her power faileit. And had na thing in mair
hatrent than prosperity of Romany, for the great cruelteis done be thaym to her
and her freindis. The Romany but more tarry slew her. In the mean time Petulius
was aduertist, that ye I Will of Wycht and Kent schyre was rebellit, and Maryus
chasit. Apperit thus plane rebellyoun of Britonis, les than the trubyll war the
mair haistelye dantit. Their nouellis mouit Petulyus to return in Brytane,
quhare he with small deficulte dantit the Brytonis. The Romany that abaid in
Brygance behynd Petulius, war geuyn mair to keip the landis before conquest,
than to persew the pepyll with new conques. And in the eir followyng Petulius
deceissit*

How Iulyus Frontinus was maid capitane of Brytane. Of his message to
Pychtis, and of their answer. And how the said Julius inuadit the Scottis
with great iniuris. Ca. x.
After the deith of Petulius, ane vaileant knycht namyt Julius Frontynus was
send in Albion with two legio^is. and was plesandly ressauit be Maryus.

Julius after his cummyng in Brytane went throw all the Roman prouincis, and
persuadit the britonis be money reasonis to persevere at the opinion of Romany.
Als sone as he had pecifyit thaym of al trubyll, he began to be desyru^ of fame
and glore, as his antecessouris war before, and tuke purpois to subdew the last
Ilis of Albion to Roman empire. Howbeit they war often before assaileit bot neuir
vincust, and to bring his purpos to effect, he left Marius behynd him i^ Kent
to hald the Brytonis under Roman lawis, syne came i^ Brygance with ane great
army. it in his passage he did na iniure nor trubyll to the Pichtis for he
beleuit thaym (fra the Scottis war vincust) sone ouirthrawin, Be (...) of
Julius in this manner was na little effray amang the scottis, for ye name was of
great renown and estimatioun amang the scottis, This Julius at his cumyng in
Brigance, vesyit ye munitionis (quhare the roman sodiouris lay) and exhortit
thaym to perseueir i^ good curage, For be their manheid and virtew it mycht
happyn the haill I Will of Albio^ to cum under the empire of Romany. Sic thyngis
done he send letteris to the Pich^is, desyryng yat they and Romany mycht
incres togydder under ane freinschip and amyte, and sumtymes remembrit thaym of
ye mysery and trubyll falling to thaym be the weris led before aganis the
Romany, and to have na cumpany with scottis, for he was commandit be ye
empriour outhir to distroy thaym ^l vterly* or ellis to thyrll thaym to
perpetual servitude. The Pychtis had their desyris in great suspitioun, and
answerit, they had great admiration ^e quhat motive, the Romany mycht have any
just occasyoun of battall aganis the Scottis. Or quhat should move thaym nocht
content of the empire of the world to seik the last Ilis of the occiane sees,
and to reif fra ye Albianis their native lyberte, les than they be insaciabyll
auaric^ war set to reif fre realms but any reason, hauand na feir nor dredour^
of the goddis to be punist for their insufferabyll iniquiteis, And for their
causis they wald cum in battal aganis ye Romany with all their power in support
of their confiderat freindis for defense of their realm and lyberte. For ye
same was nocht only proffitabyll for their commoun weil bot they war als bound
thairto be ^ic contract that mycht na wayis be dissoluit. Julius in contemption
of this answer was the mair fers, and properant aganis the Scottis, and come in
Kyle, Carrik, and Cunynghame, quhais pepyll war mair stra^g than any pepyll
that faucht before aganis the Romany. Galdus astunist be this new ordinance of
Romany (Nochtwithstandyng his heavy woundis gottin in this last battall)
gaderit his folkis out of all boundis under his dominioun, to defend his
realm. Than followit continewall scarmussyng with lycht horse but any greit
slauchter. For Galdus be noy of his woundis set him erac to yrk the Romany be
lang tarry, than to inuaide thaym be battall. Followit be their incursionis money
syndry chancis of fortoun. Sumtyme the romany vincust, su^tyme victorius.
Quhyll at last the Scottis be frequent slauchter of thayr vaileant capitanis
war attenuat, and brokyn. And Galdus be noy of the woundis gottyn in this last
battall was sa weary, that he mycht nocht do the office of ane forcy campion,
bot was brocht on an horse lytter to Argyle. Within few dayis after the Romany
come in Carrik, Kyle, and cunynghame, and slew.iii, thousand Scottis, and the
remanent vincust and chasit, And after this victory the Romany returnit to
their tentis.

How Julius Agricola was send in Britane. Of his frequent victoriis maid on
scottis and pichtis, and how he subdevvit sindry of their landis to roman
empire. Ca. xi*
IN the nixt winter Julius Frontynus fell in great infirmite be i^moderat flux
of catter, generit of wak humouris, because ye air was nubilus and donk throw
continual schouris of rane and sleit procedyng be the hycht of montanis and
great multitude of fludis and lochis aboundyng in this regioun. This infirmite
incressit ylk day more be uncouth and intemperat cauld, and mycht be curit be
na ingyne nor art of medcine. Domiciane empriour aduertist of his vehement
dolor, causit him to return i^ Italy to recouir his heil be new air and fude.
And send Julius Agricola (ane of the may vaileant capitanis that come before
his dayis in Britane) to succeid in his place. The same time the men of
Annandale slew ane great nowmer of romany on the bordouris of Brigance, and
throw the samyn victory persuadit the Pychtis and Brigandis with ye Silurianis
to rebel aganis the romany. Agricola aduertist of their attemptatis rasit his
army, and come in Pentland with mair diligence tha^ any man presumit. And after
that he had taken, and garnist all ye strenthis of their cuntre with his
wageouris, he come to Camelo^. Caranach king of Pychtis aduertist of his cumyng
gaif him battall. Nochtheles he was fynaly discomfist with all his army. After
this discomfitoure Caranach fled to Fyffe, quhilk is ane plenteous regioun
lyand betuix two firthis Tay and Forth, full of woddis Lesuris and Ualis to the
great proffet both of corn and bestyal. In it ar money louchis full of syndry
fysche. This regioun is now bair of woddis, for ye theuis war su^tyme sa
frequent in the samyn, yt they micht na way be dantit, quhyll the woddis war
bet down. Agricola after this past with his victorius army in Annandale. The
inhabitantis thairof knawyng his cumyng met him in their scharpest manner.
Nochtheles they war fynaly chasit and slane, ye remanent of thaym (yt eschapit)
war all slane be their wyffis ye first nycht they come hame. Agricola proud of
this victory, past to ye I Will of Man, quhilk rebellit money eris before aganis
Romany, and tuke it with little laubour. Quhen he had stuffit the munitionis
thairof with Roman sodiouris, he returnit in Brygance, leuand his army in the
winter schelis. The nixt symer he come throw Brygance, Carrik, Kyle and
Cunyngham. Quhais passage maid the pepyll sa astonist, that they left their
townis desert and fled to the montanis. In the symer followynge he brocht
syndry nobyll men of Albioun before him. And exhortit thaym to polecy and civil
maneris, that they mycht have templis and biggyngis on the Roman fassion. And
to put their sonnis to wise preceptouris, that after the end of Roman weris
they micht rise in virtew, eloquence, and good hauyngis. Thus past Agricola the
winter seasoun instruckand the princes of Albion with sic thyngis as apperit
for their commoun weill. The third eir after he come to Striuelyng, quhilk was
callit in they dayis the dolorus montane. For the inhabita^tis thairof hard
syndry times ane dolorus and lamentabil crying, quhilk come be illusioun of
wickit spreitis, ^essauyng the pepyll with vane superstitioun. Quhen Agricola
saw ye castle of Striuelyng set on sa stra^g (...), he reparit and biggit it
with ^a crafty and sumptuus lauboure, yt it apperit vnwynnabyll. And nocht lang
after he byggit ane bryg ouir Forth and transportit all his army be the same.
On the morrow he laid a sege to ye castle of Montbennart, traisting to have
found the king of Pychtis in it. Bot the Pychtis war so astonist be the cumyng
of the Romany, that they left the castle, and come with great diligence under
nycht to cast down ye bryg of Stryuelyng lairly biggit be romany, that ye said
Romany mycht be inclusit betuix Tay and Forth but any refuge. Agricola weill
aduertist thairof returnit fra the sege of Montbennart, and followit with sic
diligence on ye Pichtis, that they war constranit to geif battall. Nochtheles
they war fynaly vincust, and their king Karanach chasit to the watter of Tay,
quhare he gat ane bait, and eschapit. The remanent Pychtis for feir of this
victory war ra^derit with all their munitionis and strenthis. Than Agricola
past throw all boundis of Fyffe, Fothrik, and Erne, sumtymes biggand, and
sumtymes castand down the strenthis of the cuntre quhare he plesit.

How the king of Pychtis send his ambassatouris to Scottis desyryng support
aganis the Romany. How Agricola inuadit the Scottis both be see and land.
How the king of Pychtis was slane be sedition of his army. Ca. xii.
KAranach king of pichtis brokyn be this last disco^fiture, fled to Dunde,
quhare sumtyme was ane strange castle, bot it was cassyn down in ye time of
king Robert Brus, because it micht not be keipit fra Inglismen as we sal after
schaw. The Pychtis conuenit to the said castle, and exhortit Karanach their
king to have na disperation.

Howbeit his pepyll war brocht to great afflictioun and trubyll, for great nowmer
of thaym was it on live both vnbrokyn with weris, and sufficient (gyf y^
goddis war propiciant) to dyng ye Romany out of Albion. For it mycht happyn
that the Romany proud and insolent after sa money hie victoryis may fall (quhen
they belief leist) in sic inuy to fortoun, to be vincust be the pepyl quhom
they held of vilest reputatioun. For this instabyll gods turnis with suddand
quhirle ye governance of mortal creaturis. Scho hes rasi^ money other realms
with great feliciteis before the Romany had dominioun, and brocht thaym (quhen
they war in their hie and souerane honouris) to fynall rewyne. It is nocht
thairfore to be supponit that the empire of romany (sen it began with mortal
pissance) sall perpetually endure. Bot necessar sumtyme to have rewyne. yocht
their and sic persuasionis of pichtis war apprisit be their king, it nane of
thaym mycht raise his spreit and curage to any good esperance aganis romany,
bot traisting their mai^ste and pissance sa montit above y^ hycht of natural
chance, that na pepill may resist their to. Eftir lang co^sultatioun it was
concludit to send ambassatouris to Galdus to have support aganis the extreme
dangeir apperand to both their realms, according to the band sa money eris
continewit betuix Scottis and Pychtis. Galdus glaidlie condiscendit to their
peti^ionis. For he had na les indignatioun aganis the Romany for their wrangus
conques maid be thaym on the Pychtis, than on scottis. And thairfore determit
erar to haisart his realm to extreme ieoperde of armies, than to leif Ilk day
in Ithand displesour. And finalye be subdewit to servitude. Quhil the
co^fiderat kyngis were geuin in yis sort to resist their ennymes the Silurianis
be plane rebellioun slew all Romany (quhare they mycht be apprehendit) and not
only recouerit their munitionis, bot brynt all their cornis and vittallis
except sa mekill as mycht be caryit with thaym. To yat fine, that na thing
thairof should remane to ye proffet of their ennymes. Agricola weill aduertist of
their motionis come so haistelie on the Silurianis, that he dantit and punyst
yame in may rigorus wise. Nocht lang eftir he was aduertist, that his ennymes
were gaderit in great buschementis (vncertane to quhat effect) aganis the
Romany. Incontinent he followit thaym with great violence, and chasit thaym
ouir Clyde. This riueir is diuidit ane lytill space fra ye riueir of Leuin
quhair yay fall both nocht far fra other in ye Ireland seis and nocht far fra
the said riueir of Leuyn is ane castle more strange be strenth of ane crag than
any artificial laubour namyt be the pepil auld Cleuch. Bot now callit
Dunbrito^ that is to say, the castle of Britonis. Always it was so stuffet
with men and vittallis that it mycht na way be taken. Agricola occupyit with
their and siclik besynes ouir past ye fourt winter. And in the spryng of ye nixt
eir he causit the Roman navy (quhilk abaid with his ordinance in the I Will of
Wycht) to cum to Lochfyne beside Argyle. That his ennymes mycht understand na
landis nor seis fre fra Roman dominioun. And quhen he had brocht his army ouir
Clyde, he fand their the men of Lenax ane pepill unknown before to Romany and
tuke purpos to subdew thaym to Roman empire. In the mean time he gat writyngis
yat the Pychtes were rebellit. And because he dred great truble to rise (bot gyf
ye samyn were ye more haist^lie dantit) he left his first purpos, and come in
Pentland with ane legion of Romany. And dantit the Pychtis. The nixt symer he
began to search all the hauynis and portis of Argyle, and other Ilis their
about with his schippis. And come land gait ouir the riueir of Leuyn to tak ye
munitionis and strenthis of the cuntre. The Romany were first Irkit with
scharpe and difficill passage full of bre^is and thornis to their great
Impediment. Bot quhen they co^syderit ye virtew and manheid of their anciant
faderis, nathyng apperit difficill to thaym. And sa with curage ay more
incressyng they dantit na les the difficyll passage of the cuntre, Than the
pepill thairof. and finalie returnyt with huge pray of men and guddis to their
tentis. Sic things done galdus maid ane conuentioun in Athole of all pepil
under his empire abiding ye cummyng of the king of Pychtis to yat fine. That
both yair armyis beand Iunyt togiddir they mycht ye more esalie resist the
Romany. Now war the Pychtis cumand ouir the montanis of granebane (quhilkis
rynnis fra the fut of De to the castle of Dunbritone) and were nocht five mylis
fra the army of Scottis. Quhen they be unhappy chance were deuidit (...) two
factionis, and faucht amang thaym self to ye great murdir of both (...), for
ane vane cause. The king of Pychtis seeing this lamen^abil cais, ran feirslie
but his co^t armor amang the preis (quhair they were may keinly fechtand) to
have put thaym sindry, and was slane their vnknawyng quhat he was. The res^dew
of Pychtis quhilkis war left on live fra this unhappy bargane k^awing ye
slauchter of their king, skalit. And returnit hame.

How Galdus pecifyit all seditioun amang the pichtis. And how he faucht
aganis the Romany and was discomf^^t. Ca. xiii.
GAldus heirand the deith of his tender friend the king of Pichtis, become
rycht sorrowful. For it co^st^anit him to superseid his army aganis the
Romany. Nochtheles he callit his nobillis to ane counseal. Quhare he schortlie
detestand ye inopertune seditioun rysyng amang ye Pychtis, prayit thaym to
ripely auyse, how his realm mycht be defendit in sa hie dangeir thairto
approchyng. Eftir diverse opinionis it was decretit to resist the Romany erar
be frequent incursionis yan set battall fra any forthir conques. At tour
prudent men sal pas to ye Pychtis to peacifi^ thaim of al seditionis And
ambassatouris sall pas in Ireland, Norway, and Denmark to seik support aganis
the Romany. Be this counsall ambassatoris were send to the Pychtis. And schew
ye sic damage and cruelteis procedis of civil weris, yat na realms may stand
in sicker firmance quhare the same induris. Finalie the Pichtis were aggreit
amang yame self of al debatis. And Garnardus maid king in place of Karanach
before deceissit. The Pychtis (as was deuisit) send their ambassatouris in
Norway and Denmark to ye effect before said. quhil sic things were done be
Pychtis, Galdus assemblit ane army fra all boundis of his realm. And diuidit
the same in diverse buschementis. Be quhais wisdom and Ithand ieoperdis the
Romany were stoppit all the symer followyng fra any forthir conques on the
Scottis. The winter following was sa tempestuous that na weris mycht be
sustenit. And in ye nixt symmer (quhilk was the.vii. ere of the weris maid be
Agricola (come ane great cu^pany of Ireland men to Galdus and Garnardus at
Athole, quhair they were present for ye time with all the nobillis of both their
realms On ye tothir side Agricola knawing* weill the ordinance of Scottis and
Pychtes, diuidit his army in three battallis abidyng their cummyng. Galdus weill
aduertist in quhat sort Agricola purposit to invade him, cha^git haistely his
purpos. And come within ye nycht on ^ne strange legio^ of Romany. Quhilkis was
not far fra his army. Now had the Scottis slane the wache of this legioun, and
fechtand ferslie within their tentis, quhen suddanlie Agricola weill conuoyit
be his exploratoures come with strange buscheme^tes both of futme^ and horse men
on their bakkis. Nochtheles the battal was fochtin with great cruelty and
slauchter on all sydis. Quhyll the Roman baneris schynyng in ye cleir morrow
schew Agricola with al his army arrayit fornens thaym in battall. Incontinent the
confiderat pepill gaif bakkis. And fled throw desertis and mossis to their best
refuge.

How sindry Almanis and Danis come in support of scottis and pichtis, how ye
Roman navy perist in Pentland firth. Ca. xiiii.
BE yis unhappy battall, the confiderat kyngis were so brokin, that they
defendit thaym self, yair bestiall and guddis all the symer following mair be
frequent incursions, yan any set battall abidyng the cumyng of* Danys and
Norowanis to their support. Bot the Romany Ilk day more feirs and insolent be
frequent victoryis and traisti^g na thing possibil to resist their souerane
virtew, come throw the wod of Calidon with purpos to search all the last
boundis of Albioun. And because they were stoppit be strait ground yairof, they
come ouir the watter of Awmond, and set down their tentis nocht far fra
Du^keld, quhair Tay rynnis deip with few furdis in the Almane seis. This reueir
beside Dunde is two mylis braid deuidyng Fiffe fra Angus. Ye Pichtis effrayit
be cummyng of Romany sa far within their landis, brynt ane rich town namyt
Inchecuthill, quhilk stude upon the riueir of Tay, that the samyn should be na
refuge to yair ennymes, and fled with their wiffis, children and guddis to ye
motanis of Grandeben. Ye samyn time arriuit in Forth ane cumpany of Almanes
namit Usipianis, banist out of their native landis for slauchter of ane Roman
capitane and other pepill under his band. And because they bure extreme hatrent
aganis Romany, they were plesandlye ressauit. And ordanit to have certan landis
to their habitatioun beside y^ Murrayis. For they were both of a blude. And
nocht lang eftir arriuit in the firth of Tay ane vaileant capitane namyt Gildo
with.x.M. Danis to support y^ Scottis and Pichtis. Their Danis were the more
plesandlie ressauit be Garnardus king of Pychtis. That his common weil was
approcheand to hie dangeir. Galdus rycht glaid and reiosyng of the cummyng of
Gildo come to Dunde to gyf thankis to him and the remanent folkis yt come to
support their freindis. And eft may her^lie embrasing Galdus said in this
wise. I have na litil cause of Joy (may vaileant Gildo) seeing the with sa money

recover our liberte at our first metyng. And traist nocht bot Romany may be
vincust. Quhat nowmer of yame been laitly slane in the wod of Calidon. Believe e
that the virtew of Romany be als great in time of battal, as their lust is i^
time of peace, they conques honor be our civil weiris and dissension, they
turn the vices of their ennymes to ye glore of their army, quhilkis is gaderit
of diverse pepyll under diverse myndis, and sall thairfore skaill als fast syndry

Few of yame hes any certane cuntre or habitation les than it be reft. Thairfore
ye gods in punitioun of their iniquiteis hes laitly randerit ane certane of

Of the oriso^ maid be Agricola to his army and of the huge victory falling to
romany be disco^fitour of scotts. ca. xvi.
After this orison of Galdus followit in the army great noyis and clamoure be
desire of battal. On the tothir side (yocht Agricola beheld his army richt
impatient of lang tarry) it he said to yame as follows. Now is ye.viii. eir
(good co^paneonis) sen e be felicite of roman majesty with true and faithful

any other capitane did before me, we have not socht ye last bounds of Albio^ be

e (my good co^paneonis) war oftimes weary ouirpassing the difficyll montanis,
mossis, and fluddis of this regioun. I had great compassion, and knew every ane
of ou be our voce. Criand quhen sal our ennymes haif curage? quhe^ sall they

to ws quhylkis hes ouirset sa money strait montanis, woddis, fludis, and

nothir is the capitane nor the army syker that geuis their backis to ennymes,
thairfore honest deith is better than schamefull life. And hele and honor ar

we war defait heir in ye last and outmaist partis of the world. Gif e war now

miserabil lyuis. And wald p^tend na resistance, war not they ar now taken but
refuge, quharthrow e may haif honest victory. Pas good companconis throw our
ennymes, and fynis the.li. eris weir with this solemn day, that it may be put
in calendar* as end of all our weris. Do sa that nothir our lang tarry nor
rebellioun of ennymes may be impute to our neclige^ce. Skarsly was this orison
endit, quhe^ both ye armiis be byrna^d desire of battall iunit. Agricola
arrayit his folkis in sic crafty ordour. (Howbeit they were of les nowmer than
their ennymes) that they sall nocht be assaileit nothir on ane side nor other.
Galdus with na les providence arrayit the formest part of his army on ane hye
mote to discomfis the wingis of ye Roman army* and exhortit thaym with schyll
voce to perseueir in ythand bergane, and outhir to conques immortal glore or
perpetual servitude. For yat was their last day. in quhilk they mich^ wyn
outhir honor or schame. The first battall was fochtin on dreich. For the
Albanis, Danis, and Norowanis schot ane huge nowmer of arrowis and ganeis at
their first contering, Nochtheles the Romany eschewit the samyn with their
targis. The bowmen efterflicht of arrowis faucht with swerdes and lytyl buklares
(as we do it i^ our days) mair sema^d for nychtboure weir than any defense of
realmis. Throw quhilk our pepyll hes great damage quhen they meit with ennymes
of uncouth realms. The battal of speris (quhilkis stude nixt the bowmen) in
the brount with Galdus tuschit furthwart atanis, and bure money of their ennymes
with money bludy woundis on their backis, Followit the byllis, axis, lang
swerdis, and ledyn mellis with sic slauchter that ye Romany had been all
utterly discomfist, were nocht ane band of almanis (quhilkis war send la^tly in
Britane) come y^ more haistely to their support. Attour this Agricola was sa
circumspect that he stuffit his army with their Almanis in all partis quhare he
saw any danger oc^^^ring. The Albianis seeing thaym (...) their and their sa
cruelly ouirset, war astonist. Nochtheles seeing na r^fuge bot in their handis,
they ruschit al togidder in ane knot but any feir of deith or woundis with
delyueri^ mind to fecht for their realm and lyberte to ye deith. Followit ane
sorrowful battall. For the confiderat pepyll facht mair be force than craft of
cheualry. Money of thaym sloppit throw y^ body fell down above their slaatis.
Otheris offerit thaym self wylfully to be slane. Otheris (after they had
eschapit their ennymes) slew thaym self. The place (quhare they faucht) was
bludy all ouercouerit with leggis, armis, and wappynnis skatterit throw al
bou^dis thairof. Both ye armyis faucht with perseuerand hatrent, quhyll the
nycht constranit thaym to sever. The confiderat pepyl and their freindis
(quhilkis war left on live) after this unhappy battall fled to the nixt
montanis, quhare they biggit fyr^s to oui^ pas the nycht. Than come to thaym
great confluence of men and women seik and their freindis with money sorrowful
sychis, murnyng, and teris. Incontinent Galdus (that their dolorus spr^ichis and
cryis sall nocht be patent to his ennymes) commandit all his army to schout
with schyl noys and sang, quhyll the women war expellit fra his camp. The
confiderat kyngis seeing on the morrow their power sa brokyn yt they mycht nocht
renew battall, co^mandit their folkis to return hame. And left behynd thaym
ane huge fire birnand with bald and vehement fla^mes on the said montanis to
the heuyn, that their ennymes mycht have na presumptioun of their departing. In
this unhappy battall war slane.xii. thousand Romany. and.xx. thousand scottis
and pichtis with money other pepyll that come to their support. Gyldo ye
vaileant capitane of Danis ruscha^d ouir feirsly on his ennymes was slane on ye
samyn manner with ye may part of his cumpany.

How Agricola reparit his navy to pa^ about the Ilis of albioun, and brint
syndry schippis of Danis. Of uncouth meruelli^ seen in albioun. and of the
deith of Agricola. Ca. xvii.
THe day followyng this unhappy nycht, maid ye discomfiture of Scottis patent
to their ennymes, for their camp was void, and plenist with nocht bot deid
bodyis but any quhisperyng on the montanis, quhare may gild was hard before.
the Romany traisting their tythinges procedyng be sl^cht, inhibit any for^hir
chase to be. O^he^^s proud after after their feliciteis commandit vaileant and
chosyn men to search all ye woddis and strenthis to espy gyf any hyd wachyng of
enimes war within the samyn. Ane certane of Romany followi^g this last cou^sal
followit sa unwarily, that they war all slane. On the morrow Agricola seand his
army sa brokin, that he micht nothir renew the samyn, nor it pas ouir ye
mo^tanis of Granebene but extreme dangeir, past with his victorius army in
Angus, quhare he abaid al ye nixt winter. And in the mean time he was
aduertist, how the may part of his navy was lost, and ye resydew thairof
brokyn with great calamyte arriuit in Argyle. Agricola mouit nocht his
contenance for their nouellis, for he fermely beleuit his army for this small
calamyte delyuerit of all other trubyll that was apperyng thairto be inuy of
fortoun after sa lang prosperity and victoryis. Incontinent he reparit his
schippis with new marineris and otheris quhilk had sicker experience of al
dangeris and firthis in the occiane sees. And co^mandit thaym (as he war to
fecht aganis all chance of fortoun) to pas the samyn way (they eid before) about
the Ilis of Albion. This navy be prosper wyndis arriuit finaly in the mouth of
Tay and brynt the flo^ of Danis quhylk lay in ye said firth all the winter
before. Syndry meruellis war seen in Albion before this last battal, that Galdus
faucht with romany. Money byrna^d speris war seen fleand in the air. Ane great
part of the wod of Calidon apperit birnand all nycht. Howbeit na thing apperit
thairof in the day. Ane flot of schyppis was seen in the air, ane schoure of
stanis was in Athole, siclike in Angus ranit paddokis, Ane monstoure was borne
in Inchecuthyll with doubyll membris of men and women with sa abhomynabyll
figure, that it was distroyit be ye pepyll. Their uncouth and wonderful
meruellis maid the pepyll astonist, for they war interpret to syndry facis.
Sumtymes to ye good, sumtymes to the evil. The empriour Domiciane heirand their
hie and vaileant dedis of Agricola, was rycht sorrowful in his mind, hauand na
lytyl in dignatioun, that the fame of ane private man should obscure his
imperial estait. And thairfore send haisty writtingis to him to return (al
excusatioun ceissing) to rome to ressaue ye governance of ane new province
namyt Syria, vacand be deceis of Actilius Ruffus last legate thairof. Agricola
sone after his cumyng to Rome was poisonit be inuy of the said Domiciane
empriour.

How Tribellyus was send in Britane. How the Romany fell in great diuisioun
amang thaym self. And of the huge victory gottyn on thaym be Galdus. Ca. xviii.
After ye deith of Agricola, Gneus Tribellius was maid capitane of Brytane, and
fan^ the Romany in great felicite, howbeit the samyn schort time indurit. For
ane great contention raise betuix this new capitane Tribellius and ane other
capitane namyt Tribellianus, quhilk of yame should have may auctorite above the
army. The first was autorist be ye army, for he was cosing to Agricola. The
secund was autorist be the empriour. After lang contentioun Tribellianus
departit with ane nowmer of chosin men in France. Galdus knawyng weil yis
seditioun amang ye Romany come with ane army of Scottis and Pychtis in Angus,
quhair this new capitane Trebellius was with the residew of Romany for the
time. Trebellius astonist be his suddane cummyng tocht al thing was to be done
than, erar be manheid and good werkis, than be any consultation. And
nochtwithstandyng that his army bure hatrent aganys him, he went ^orthward with
displayit baner. At last the army seand him nocht ^o ye chargis of ane vaileant
capitane, dischargit him of auctorite. And (...) Sysynnius (quhilk was brod^r
to Trebellianus before rehersyt) (...) ^^uerne thaym in that may (...)
adventure. Sysynnius refu^i^ this charge, and said. Gyf he ^^ssauit auctorite in
sic extrem^ dan^eir, it should be occasioun of great diuisioun and truble within
the army Quhill the Romany were at sic deba^^, Galdus come with arrayit hoist
en sycht. The Romany be suddane cumyng of Galdus mycht nocht array thaym in
their best auyse. Nottheles both the armyis Iunit with birnand desire on ilk
side. The confiderat pepill faucht with perseuerand manheid. Quhill at the last
Sysynnius woundit to ye deith, fled out of the field and money other Romany
with him. Incontinent all the army of Romany gaif bakkis, and fled to ye nixt
wod. On quhom followit the Scottis and their confiderat freindis with Ithand
slauchter. Quhill at last Galdus dredand sum dangeir to fall be their
continewal feirsnes, callit yame be sound of trumpat to his standart. Nocht the
les they were sa far enragit with hatrent aganys the Romany, they couth nocht
be brocht yairfra, quhil the nycht bereft thaym the lycht. Ye confiderat pepill
passit the nycht followyng with great Joy and blythnes of dansyng, singyng and
playing. Siclike as was vsit in they dayis.

On the morrow the preistis come with processioun in their may reverend
habitis, and gaif thankis to the goddis, quhilkes eftir money calamyteis
sustenit be thaym mair than i. eris in continewall battall had grantit anis ane
honest victory of their ennymes.

How the Romany war doung out of all partis of scotland and syndry times
vincust be the vaileant Galdus. Ca. xix.
THe romany brokin in this manner, and seeing na sickirnes to abide in Angus
aganis sa feirs and cruel ennymes, rasit their tentis and come within the nycht
to Inchecuthill. And quhen they had transportit the residew of their army ouir
Tay. They brak the brig thairof, that thayr ennymes should nocht follow* Galdus
aduertist of their fleyng partit the rich spule (that was gottin in yis last
field) amang his army efferyng to their manheid and vassalage. And on the
morrow he tuke consultatioun quhat was best to be done. Be this consultatioun
it was concludit that the Scottis sall persew the Romany, and dyng thaym forth
of all partis of Albioun. The Scottis incontinent ruschit to harnes with all
the army of Pychtis co^curryng to their opinioun. And followit on the Romany,
that ye iniuris so oftymes done be thaym should be anis sufficiently punist. At
last quhen they were cumyn to Inchecuthill, they fand the brig bet down. And
returnyt thairfore to Dunkeld quhair they transportit all their army be ane
brig of ^re. The Romany heirand their eu^yng ordourit thaim self in good array
and chesit ane new capitane namit Chelius to govern thaym in this may
dangerus battall. Sone eftir both ye armyis Iunyt, and faucht lang time with
vncertane victory. Quhill at last the Romany were vincust and chasit with
Ithand slauchter, quhill they were dreuin to the wod of Calidone. In this
battall were slane.v.M. Romany. And.ii.M. of scottis and their confideratis.
Syndry cumpanyis of Britonis eftir this victory come to Galdus. For als sone
as it was schawin in Walis, that the Romany were twyis vincust be the Scottis
and Pychtis, incontinent all the princis of Britane maid rebellioun. And eftir
that they had slane the Romany in all pertis (quhair they mycht be apprehendit)
they send ambassatouris to Galdus with money rich Iowellis, schawyng thaym
reiosit that eftir sa lang rage of fortoun aganis him, he began to be victorius
and fortunat. In the mean time the Romany send their ambassatouris to Marius
king of Britonis, lamentand the heavy iniuris done to thaym be Scottis and
Pichtis. And schew (gif they gat nocht support in time) they should be
schamefully doung out of all boundis conquest with sa great difficulte before be
Romany. Marius answerit throw rebellioun of Britonis in sindry partis aganis
him, he stude i^ daily feir of his life. Attour the oung wenchis, gestouris,
and co^moun pepil sang daily ^allattis in derisioun and skorne of Romany. And
be yat way he knew not quhay were freindis or fayis to him in Britane. Attoure
Domiciane empriour was so haitit for the cruel slauchter of the Senate and
cietezanis of Rome, that nocht apperit bot civil battallis. Thus mycht na
support come in Britane. For their causis his mind was set erar to keip ane part
to him of Albion with sicker firmance, yan schamefully to tyne the hail empire
thairof. This answer maid na little affray amang the Romany. In the mean time
was schawin, ye Galdus was within ten mylis fra the tentis of Romany with ane
army both of men and women yat mycht beir wapinnis to dyng ye Romany out of
all boundis of his empire. Ye Romany for feir of his cuming left the wod of
Calidon, and fled in Brigance. Galdus weil aduertist be quhat passage his
ennymes were departi^, set him with may diligence to follow on yair bakkis,
yat he mycht distroy thaym but any recover, before they gat any support fra
Rome. In this voyage Galdus left the segyng of the castellis and strenthis
stuffi^ be romany. And come with great deligence in Brigance, and their me^ him
ane huge nowmer of pepyll si^ as haitit the Romany, all reiosyng atanis that
the said Galdus brokin with sa money calamiteis and truble was neuir disparit,
bo^ euir reseruyng him and his pepill to better fortoun. Galdus ressauit all
their pepill with plesand visage, and persuadit thaym to have good esperance. For
as than he was nocht passand to battall, bot erar to sic^er victory. And the
hard fortoun sa lang rageand aganis him and his pepill was brokin* And
thairfore traistit behynd sa money cruel extorsionis done be ennymes to have
sumtyme ane glorius victory of thaym. The Romany seeing the confiderat pepil
cum in Brigance with sa hie curage and spreit were affrayit. Nochtheles
confidyng in na thing mair surele, tha^ in yair handis They went forwart in
thayr best array, sayng that day was other the gait to their triumphant glore
or than perpetual schame Than ilk ane exhortit other to have hope of victory,
sen they were to fecht aganis ane vane and barbar people, and to haif in memory
the great manheid and virtew of yair eldaris with more respect to their common
than singular weill. And erat to de in ye battal, tha^ to incur the schame
and dishonor that ya^ mycht neuir eftir do away. quhil the Romany were
exhortyng thaym (...) ^ith their and siclike wou^dis, come haistely ane heavy
schoure of arowis and ganeis schot on thaym be their ennymes. In ye mean time
ane cumpany of Britonis (quhilkis were laitlie send be Marius in support of
Romany) come to the Scottis and Pychtis. Money of the Romany be fleyng of their
Britonis de fakit curage. Otheris seeing na remeid tuke the more spreit, and
with great force ouirset the wyngis quhair the women faucht. Than Galdus rycht
circumspect in all his werkis, send ane cumpany of fresche men to their
support, be quhom the Romany were dreuin sum part abak. The women were more
cruel tha^ any men quhen they saw thayr ennymes vincust. Thus had the Romany
been inuadit on Ilk side, were nocht they had their tentis at yair bakkis. Money
of thaym perseuerit in battall, and were slane. Otheris fled to their tentis* on
quhom the Scottis followit sa fast, that they slew thaym heir and their and
kes^ thaym in the fowseis. Intendyng be filling of the fowseis with deid bodyis
to make ane reddy gai^ to their tentis. Nottheles the Romany defendit their
tentis with incredibyll laubour and manheid, and wald not suffer their ennymes
to enter on thaym, quhill the nycht seuerit thaym on ylk side.

Of the message send be Romany to the confiderat kyngis. And of their answer.
How the co^fiderat kingis gaif peace to the Romany, Ca. xx.
THe Scottis nochtwithstandyng the cumyng of the nicht went to the nixt wod to
bring treis to fyl the fowseis quhare the tentis of romany lay. Otheres maid
syndry instrumentis to break down their trinschis. Otheris wacheit all nicht to
stop yame fra fleing, and abaid the cumyng of ye day with byrnand desire. The
Romany seeing on the morrow sa great ordinance reddy atanis to invade thaym,
desyrit assuuerance of the wache to send oratouris to the confiderat kyngis to
treit peace. Part of Scottis said, na conduct should be geuyn to Romany, and na
alliance to be maid with thaym. Bot victory to be vsit with may rigor. And
all the Romany (that fled to yair tentis) slane. That be their slauchter al
other pepyl may take exampil how odious it is both to goddis and men to invade
realms and pepyll but occasioun of iniure. Otheris said, best was to use their
victory with mesure, and not to be ouir insolent and proud for yis felicite,
sen every pepyll ar thirlit to sic vncertane lawis of fortoun that eftir
aduersite cumys prosperity. And ^fti^ prosperity cumys aduersite. And ^or this
reason the Romany should be herd, and yair ambassatouris saiffit be the law of
pepill. This last counsal was apprisit. Incontinent come four honorabil men
with fair vissage cloithit in their manner with na les precious than semand
abuleme^tis, and fell on kneys before the confiderat kyngis. Als sone as they
were ^^sit. Ane of thaym (to quhilk the charge was committit) said in this wise.
The Roman army and capitanis dantouris of the world desyring our amyte and

Pychtis the last pepyll of the world, sen their first beginning desirit na

faucht neuir bot in yair pure defense. The Romany were knawin to thaym first as
cursit reuaris of realms be insaciabill avarice. Eftir yt they had maid weir

quhen they had subdewit the world and the may part of Albion to the great

traistyng their iniuris na othirwayis to be eschewit, it he wald be more
propiciant, thynkand sufficient both for y^ time present and to cu^ that ye

Romany sal pas out of all boundis pertenand to scottis and Pychtis. And rander

sall gyf their great ayth neuir to inuaid Scottis nor Pychtis bot euir to stand

and departit but any forthir iniure.

How all the strenthi^ of Scotland war recouerit fra the Romany be
conditioun of peace. And of the deith of Galdus. Ca. xxi.
BE Gneus Tribellius, ye Roman army was nowmerit (Quhen Agricola left it)
to.lx. thousand men. Bot at this time throw frequent victorijs maid on thaym,
they war skarsly.xx. thousand left on live. After their departing all the
boundis of Scotland (quhilkis war garnist before be Romany) war randerit to
Scottis. and Pychtis. After this Galdus skaillit his army and went to Epiak,
quhilk was the principal ciete of Scotland and began to institute his pepyll in
civil maneris. And to ye fine y^ na man of his realm be occasion of sleuth
sall use reiffis on the cuntre, he send all superflew pepyl to be wageouris to

Of the vicius king Lugtak and how he was slane for his unhappy life and
tyranny. Ca. primo.
THe vailea^t prince Galdus endit in manner before rehersit, succedit his son
Lugtak ane odius and mischeuus tyrane. He was als far haitit with the pepyll
for his vice, as his fader was luffit for his virtew. He was far different fra
his fader both in maneris and ingyne, geuin to his eyes and lust. He slew money
of all ye rich men in his cuntre. For na other cause, bot allanetly to confiske
their guddis. He gaif the ministration of Justice to may wrangus and
auaricius men specially sic men yat war geuyn to co^ques guddis to him but any
reason or sycht to Justice. Followit continewall reiffis in all partis of his
realm put punitioun. Gretest schrewis may autorist, and virtuous personis
may ouirthrawin. This odius tyrane persewit his nobyllis be vane causis. Sum
of thaym banist, and othiris slew that he micht conques their landis and
guddis. He had sic affectioun to reiffairis and oppressouris, that he namit
thaym brethir and counsalouris in his wrytyngis, and luffit nane sa weill as
him that culd find ingyne to reif his subdittis. The remanent dedis of his
unhappy life ar sa dedestabyll, that they ar mair worthy to be hyd than dreuyn
in any mannis eiris. For he with vnbridillit lust fuleit his anttes hes
douchteris, his systeres and his sister douchteris. And was penitent of na
thing bot only that he mycht nocht suffice to co^pleit his lust with thaim all,
his horribyll dedis war sufferit two eris be his nobyllis. Bot na thing mouit
thaym sa mekyl, as his scornful detractioun. Be quhilk he callit thaym auld
dotand fulis. He had nane sa familiar to him, as fidlaris, bordellaris,
makerellis, and gestouris, and siclike men of vile estimatioun, and cled thaym
with publik auctorite, beleuyng all thyngis to succeed weil be their
governance. Bot his cruelteis and folly mycht nocht be lang vnpunist. For sone
eftir ane counsal was set be him at Dou^stafage to punis syndry men that
repreuit his vice. In the mean time raise sic debait betuix him and his
nobillis, that he was slane with all his cursit cumpany in quhome he gaif both
the governance of his body and realm, in the Third eir of his regne, he was
buryit with rich pomp in Dounstafage bot the bodyis of his unhappy
counsalouris war left on the feildis, to be deuorit be the houndis.

Of king Mogallus, and how he come with ane army aganis the romany. Of his
orisone maid to the sepulture of Galdus. Ca. ii.
LUgtak the tyrane endit i^ this manner, Mogallus was maid king for he was
nepote to Galdus gottin of his douchter. This Mogallus after his coronation set
him to follow the wisdom and maneris of Galdus his gudschir, and to keep the
faith and promis to Romany and Britonis be the peace before contrackit. And
that his pepyl mycht leif in quiet but any seditioun, he reparit every thing
that was before mysgidit be the tyrane Lugtak. And restorit the relygyoun of
goddis with the samyn cerymonis as they war first institute. Traistyng fra he
had gottyn the beniuolence of his goddis (quhilkis war ennymes to his pepil for
the abhomynabil life of Lugtak) that al thingis should succeed ye better. The
scottis began to rise ylk day in esperance of better fortoun. seeing their king
follow ye behauyngis of his gudschir Galdus, and reddy to reform al enormyteis
of his realm. Nocht lang after come ambassatouris fra Pichtis to Mogallus

with fire and swerd in Pentland, and slane ane great nowmer of pepyll in defense
of their awin guddis, Siclike the men of Galloway and Annandale complanit that
ane huge pray of guddis war tan^ be romany out of their landis. Mogallus
hauand ingyne na les geuyn to cheualry than werkis of peace, reiosit to have
occasioun of battall, that he mycht be sum notabyll vassalage be comparit to
his vaileant antecessouris. Nochtheles he send his ambassatouris desyryng
^edres of the damage be thaym done. Their ambassatouris gat nocht bot ane
answer full of hie contemptioun and skorne. Than Mogallus tuke the goddis in
wytnes that both ye faith prompttit to him be Romany wa^ brokyn and his
message co^tempnit. And sone after he rasit his army, and come in Galloway
quhare he visy^e the sepulture of Galdus his gudschir. And quhen he had maid
certane cerimonis after the custom of they dayis, he fell on kneis, and said. O
vaileant and inuincibyll prince quhilk after sa great aduersite of fortoun did
recouir the realms of scottis and pichtis with huge difficulte. And dang thy
pyssant and rich ennimes be favor of goddis out of their boundis with na les
honor than manheid. We thy natyue pepyll (quhylkis wirschyppit the on live

lamentabyll voce before this thy eternal sepulture the last refuge to ws in

ennymes. Quhom thou sumtyme may vaileantly vincust in their bou^dis, and
prayis the gif thou hes any auctoryte before the goddis for thy syngulare virtew

be thy syngulare manheid to implore thy mercy in their last refuge. Quhairthrow
thy name emparyng sall na wayis, bot euir endure in terroure of thy fais. Als
sone as Mogallus had maid his prayer to Galdus in this manner, all the army
began to enbras his image, and maid their prayer thairto for happy passage and
returnyng in their iurnay. The wod women (sic as war inflammit with divine
spreit) skurgit yame self to make thaym seem the mair religious. And be advise
of Druydes the solemn preistis before rehersit, they maid solemn cursynis on
the romany for violation of their faith and band before contrackit.

How the confiderat kyngis come with their armyis aganis the romany. Of the
orison maid be Mogallus, and Lucius Anthonius to their armyis, and how the
Romany war discomfist. Capi. iii.
MOgallus come not lang eftir in Annandale, to meit Unipane king of Pichtis.
For he abaid his cu^ming with ane weil arrayit ost of pichtes. Als sone as
both their armyis was assemblit togidder, they went both in Westmurland and
Cumbir, quhilkes war (as than) provinces of romany. And first they brocht ane
huge pray of men and guddis fra the samyn. And the resydew that mycht nocht be
tursit) put in fire. The inhabitantis for feir of their iniuris fled to ork, and
complanit to Lucius Anthonius roman^ capitane of the cruelteis done be Scottis
and pichtis. Lucius tha^ assemblit ane strange army, and went forthwart with
greit ordinance to ^ant his ennymes. Mogallus seeing his ennymes in sicht,
callit his men to the standart, and said in this manner. I find na thing
(vaileant campionis) that bringis nobyll me^ sooner to loving and glore, than to
resist ye iniure of ennymes fechtand for yair realm and liberte to the deith,
that they be nocht subdewit to schamfull seruytude. As may be weill prouyn
both be example of uncouth pepyll, and be syngulare virtew of our vaileant
antecessouris. Remember, be quhat manheid and wisdom king Edere supportit
Cassibilane king of Britonis, Quhen Julius the Roman consul was doungin out
of Albion, be quhilk he conquest na les honor to him self, tha^ to his
posterite. Siclike the nobyll Caratak was na les decorit be his virtew in merit
of loving, quhen he fechtand sa often times be syndry cha^cis of fortoun mycht
neuir be vincust. And yocht he had ane hard fortoune, and brocht (as presoneir)
to Rome be treasoun of Cartumandia. it he had inuincibyll spreit, defendyng ay
his realm to his last dayis. And was haldy^ yairfore in sic reverence and
dredour amang his ennymes, that he was finaly restorit both to his realm and
honouris, to be exampyll to all other after him to have excellent fortitude
aganis all trubyl. Siklike Corbreid his bruthir in defense of his liberte,
faucht sa cruelly aganis the proud Romany and brocht thaym to sic
irrecouerabyll afflictioun and slauchter, that they mycht neuir invade this
realm during his lyffe.

Remember alsua my gudschir Galdus may vaileant prince that euir was before
his dayis. Howbeit he was inuadit with perpetual trubyll fechtand nocht only
aganis Romany bot aganis fortoun, sa often vincust and chasit, his army brokin.
(Ilk calamite i^cressing above other) it with mychty curage he perseuerit ay in
hope of better fortoun. Quhill at last be lang battall of virtew aganis his
unhappy infortuniteis, he ouirthrew fortoun, and conquest be mercyall prowes
and manheid sa interminabyl victory and glore, that he vincust his ennymes with
iii. syndry battallis, and brocht thaym be fleing to their tentis to sic
subiectioun and mesiry, that quhare they culd nocht be content before of the
^aill boundis of the world, that mycht nocht we^ll defend thaym self within
their sorrowful tentis, throw quhilk he gat the excellent glore that neuir
before succedit to leuand crea^^^^. Hauand the ambassatouris of Romany (be
quhome al kingis and realmis be subdewit) deieckit at his feit desiring grace.
In mair witness heirof (the place quhare their Romany war defait) is callit
Galloway that the fame of his illuster werkis sall neuir euanis bot ay remane
in recent memory. Forthir the mair strange, the mair pissant that his fais war,
the mair glore succedit to him and his pepyll. Heirfore e my good cumpaneonis
(quhilkis ar ye posterite of they forcy ca^pionis that sumtyme faucht aganis
the Romany with ye said Galdus). Remember ya^ our battall is this day only
aganis yame, quhilkis hes before sa oftymes been vincust be our cheuelry, and
remanis only on live be our mercy. Consider weill quhat e ar, for e ar
victouris vnbrokin of curage, and defendouris of our realm, liberteis, wyffis,
barnis, and natyue guddis, and ar to fecht for na ambutioun nor avarice, bot
allanerly be constant virtew. Consider als quhat schame it i^ to think that
Romany may noch^ be vincust. Sen they have been s^ often before defait, traist
fermely the same virtew and fortoun is in to our handis, as was in our
eldaris^ Pas forthwart (vaileant campionis) for victory is present in our
handis and put our vincust fais to flicht, for all thingis sal follow (as e
pleis) gyf e have curage. Mogallus be their wordis inflammit ye myndis of his
army to battall. On the tothir side Lucius Anthonius was na les diligent
perswadyng the Romany be vehement orison to do vaileantly be exemple and
imitation of their forebearis, and to remember thaym be quhat difficill
laubouris they led battallis, and vincust their forcy and strange ennymes.
Remembering thaym als how they war than to fecht aganis ane barbar pepyll but
virtew, and mouit to battall be wodnes and fury. Be quhilk both their manheid
and reason was confundit, and mouand thaym to battall be fuliche hardiment. And
thairfore (quhen may dangeir occurritt) hay war sone discomfist and brokin.
He desirit yame als to have confidence in ye Roman virtew, and take na feir of
their bludy cruel and vnarmit ennymes, deuidit amang thaym self be perpetual
sedition. And nocht assemblit for luf and weill of their self, bot only for
hatrent of their fais. Take our wappinnis (said he) with sicker esperance of
victory, and e sall conques infinite glore but straik, and recouir the landis
tynt before be sleuth of Gneus Tribellius. Skarsly war their wordis said, quhen
both the armyis iunit with mair arde^t Ire tha^ may be tauld. The Romany
schot yair dartis, and ye co^fiderat pepyl yair arowis ganeis and stanis. Quhen
ye women (of quhilkis great nowner was in this army) had cassin incredybill
multitude of stanis, they tuke their awful wappinnis, and faucht above the
cruelte of men ruscheand on their fais but any feir of wou^dis or deith. The
strenth of the ground was na les support to our folkis than impediment to our
fais. For they knew nocht the ground and fell sumtymes in swardis of mossis and
su^tyme in well Eyes, throw quhylk they war often tymis deuydit in their fechting.
it the battal was cruelly fochtin in all partis specially in the myddis quhare
the capitanis inflamit the curage of their army. The romany contending to saif
thaym fra thirlage of barbar pepyll. And the Scottis to keip the victory gotin
be manheid of their eldaris. After lang and lauborius battall they left their
swerdis and faucht with schort dageres. And because sa innowmerabyll slauchter
was on all sidis, and nane of the armyis appering to geif place to other, the
capitanis on athir side war penitent that their army iunit that day. At last
the scottis and pichtis be innatiue ferocite began to put their ennymes abak.
Nocht as they war discomfist, bot eschewing sum thing the fury of battall.
Because they mycht na forthir resist ye multitude of their ennymes. Quhill
Lucius beheld sa hie da^geir appering to his folkis, And was exhortyng thaym to
renew battall, he gat sic ane straik with ane arow, yt he mycht na mair tarry,
bot fled out of the field. Incontinent all his army fled to ye nixt woddis. Ane
cumpany of thaym war stoppit to cum to their fallowis, and nocht knawyng
(quhare to fle) war slane be scottis, because they wald nocht be takin
presoneris.

How Adriane empi^ioure come in Britane, and biggit ane strange wall to saif
the Britonis and Romany fra scottis and pichtis, how he returnit in France
and left Victorine to be capitane of Britane. Ca. iiii.
NOw was the son fast tendyng to his occasion, quhen the confiderat pepyll be
sound of tru^pat colleckit the residew of their folkis fra the chase, and
passit the remanent of ye nycht with incredibyll blithnes, syngyng, dansyng,
and karolyng. At the spring of the day they gaderit the rich spuleis of slane
men. And in the mean time quhen the two kyngis war takand consultatioun for the
weill of their army, was schawin that ane cumpany of Romany (quhylkis war
eschapit fra this last battal (war within two mylis to their army ga^gand will
and nocht knawand be quhat cuntre or partis they mycht may esaly fle,
Incontinent ane band of scottis went to thaym, and left none of thaym on lyffe,
for they refusit to be takyn. On the morrow the confiderat kyngis maid
sacrifice (as the gyse was in they dayis) to their gods for ye victory
falling to yame. Syne tuke diligent examynatioun quhat personis did may
vassalage in this last battall, and rewardit thaym thairefter. Lucius Anthonius
vincust in this manner send to the emprioure Adryane, schawyng quhat trubyll was
laitly fallyn in Brytane be weris of scottis and Pichtis, and desyring him to
send haistely support in Britane. Otherwise ye Romany salbe schamefully doung
out of all bou^dis thairof, or ellis subdewit to servitude of barbar people.
Adriane empriour to dant this rebellioun come with ane huge army in Albioun.
Eftir this cumyng he was aduertist how ye Scottis with more cruelte than before,
were cumyng in ye Roman landis, ceissyng fra na manner of cruelte that mycht be
deuisit on ye inhabitantis thairof. Adriane astonyst and rycht desyrus to
revenge their offencis, come to ork* Quhare he remanit with the remanent army of
Britonis, quhill he was prouidit with two monethis vittallis to pas on the
Scottis and Pychtis. Sone eftir he rasit his camp, and with great difficulte
brocht ye samyn (...) Tyne. And on the four^ day eftir, he come in the landis
quhilkis were waistit be the Scottis. And because he fand every thing (yat mycht
nurys his army) distroyit, he began to inquire of quhat life and condition their
pepill been, that maid sic extorsionis in the Ronane landis. It was schawin.
They were ane rude and vndantit pepill, and lay their forth all winter nocht
withstanding ye cauld frostis and storms. And lay at sic strenthis and mossis,
that they mycht not be persewit but extreme dangeir to their inuasouris. For
their causis he left purpos to pas any forthir, and to keip thaym fra all
incursionis of ennymes in times cumyng, he beildit ane huge wall of fail and
deuait rycht braid and hie in manner of ane hill fra the mouth of Tyne fornens
the Almane seis to the flude of Esk fornens the Ireland seis. This wall
was.lxxx. mylis of lenth. It is said in our croniklis that this dike was begun
be Adriane, and endit be Seuerus the Roman emprioure. And callit the wall of
Seueir. Bot we followyng Ueremond callis it the wall of Adriane fra the first
foundoure. Sone eftir Adriane past in Westmureland and Walis, quhare he was
aduertist of new rebellioun maid aganys him be the inhabitantis of ye said
la^d, nochtheles he behauit him sa prudently in this matter that the principal
mouaris yairof were punyst. And the cuntre restorit to his opinioun. Eftir this
he come to London and Kent, and rewardit the nobillis of Britane for their
faith and obedience kepit to Romany. Sic thyngis done he returnit in France
with Lucius Anthonius quhilk was yan trublit with great infirmite. And left
Uictoryne i^ his place. This Uictoryne eftir ye departing of Adriane stuffit
all the castellis and strenthis of Britane with new munition and vageouris to
resist the violence of Scottis and Pychtis. Followit money eris eftir great
tranquillite ama^g the Britonis.

How Scottis and Pichtis partit ye landis be^ond the wall of Adriane. How
king Mogallus was degenerit in corruppit life, and slane for his tyranny. Ca. v.
THe Scotts and Pychtis partit amang thaym al ye landis of Brytane lyand
beound the wall of Adriane in this manner. All the landis fornens the Ireland
seis were geuin to Scottis. And the landis fornens the Almane seis to Pychtis.
The strenthis liand nixt ye wall of Adrian war gar^yst with great munitionis to
keip the country fra iniure of Ronis. Bot we return to our history. the
resydew of Mogallus lyffe was in quiet but any uncouth or domestyk weiris.
Nochtheles this huge victory of romany maid him degenerit fra virtew in may
detestabyll vicis. For he was sa geuyn to avarice and lust in his eild, that he
eschamyt of na manner of vice nor oppressioun done aganis his liegis, defloring
the wyffis of his nobyllis and co^monis but any schame or respect to their
estait. And nocht only deforsit virginis and matronis, bot annullit all
constitutionis and lawis maid for punitioun of sic horribyll dedis. Attour to
aggrege his tyranny, he gave license to theiffis and reuaris to take the gudis
of their nychtbouris (gif they wantit) but punitioun, and slew all the rich
men of his cuntre be vane causis and co^fiscat their gudis. He was the first
king that statute ye gudis of banist or condampnit personis to be confiscat to
the kyngis use, but any respect to their wiffis, children, or dettouris. Before
that time, the gudis, landis, and possessionis of all condampnit personis come
but any pley to fre dispositioun of their wyffis and children. This law
(quhilkis schawis weill ye cursit avarice of Mogallus) is it obseruat but any
reuocatioun in this regioun. And it the horribyl dedis of this tyrane mycht
nocht be lang vnpunist. For the nobillis and commonis impacient to suffer sic
tyrannyis, conspyrit aganis him, and instruckit certane men to wait ganand
place and time for his slauchter. Mogallus knawyng the nobyllis co^spirit
aganis him on this manner, tuke consultatioun of certane Iuglouris (quhylkis war
richt frequent in they dayis) to fle in ye Ilis. And to dissimill his passage
he went to his bed sonar than he was wont, as he had been strikin with suddane
infirmite. Sone after he armyt him with his halkrig, bow, and arowis, and fled
with two seruandis to the nixt wod, and left behynd him the residew of his
cursit cumpany (as ane tyrane dois) that confidis in no creature. The nobyllis
that war conspirit aganis him beand aduertist of his fleig, followit on him sa
scharply, that he was finaly comprehendit and slane the.xxvi. eir of his regne.
Fra the incarnation.i C.xlviii. eris. Anthonius Pius beand emprioure and
Phiacus albus regnand above the Pychtis. the heid of Mogallus was borne on ane
staik to the nyxt town, quhare ane multitude of pepyll war gaderit to his
perpetual schame. It was deuysit be the pepyl yt his body should be cassyn to ye
houndis and reuanus beistis, nochtheles the nobyllis mouit be ye worthy dedis
of Galdus his gudschir co^mandit his heid and body to be buryit amang the
kyngly sepulturis of his progenitouris. This schameful and unhappy end maid
Mogallus, degenerat fra the virtew of his antecessouris.

Roman princis persewit christian pepyll with great cruel^e, and brocht great

reli^ioun of cristin faith. Quhilk (...) ay the more strenthy that it (...)
pers^wit be tyranny, and agmen^it with na thing sa nickle, as be scharp
persecutioun. Bot we will retur^ quhare we left) to our history. Mogallus
mycht weill have been noumerit in the beginning of his empire amang may
nobill princis. Bot i^ ye end he was nothir worthy to be king, nor it ane
leuand creature and deseruit weil ye end that he gat. Forthir, his son
Conarus (quhilk succedit eftir him) had litil better for town or maneris. For
he instrukit hes men with hid wachyng to sla his fader, and so be unnatural
cruelte he succedit to ye crown. In the beginning of his empire he dissimilit
the vices, to quhilkis he was naturally inclinit. Als sone as the realm was
stabillit to him in sicker peace, he waistit all the publik rentis per^enand to
the crown in his infamit lust, and gave braid landis and riches to may vile
and diffamit creaturis, because they louit his corruppit maneris and vice* and
be counsall of their wickit schrewis he gouernit his realm, detestyng all
nobill and virtewis men of his realm. And set him to induce his people to
superflew and riatus bankettis contrar the temperance of his antecessouris. At
last quhen he had waistit all his treasour and substance in money scha^ful
wayis, he co^uenit his nobillis to ane counsal. In ye quhilk he schew be lang
orison the honest and triumphant cheir of his house, as na litill glore should be
geuyn thairto. And because his rentis and treasour was nocht sufficient to
sustene the samyn (as he vsit) he desyrit ane geneall stent to be taken throw ye
realm of Ilk person eftir his faculte, to sustene his house and seruandis,
according to his estait riall and honors It was answerit be his nobillis, yt
they mycht nocht gyf ane haisty deliverance in sa great ane matter. Because he
desirit certane thyngis, quhilkis were neuir desyrit be any other prince before.
And for that cause they should degestlie auyse, and schaw to him their mind
concerning the same on the morrow. Their nobillis in ye nycht followyng conuenit
to their secreit counsall. And because they fand the king of evil governance,
they concludit to degraid him of his auctorite and kingdom. On the morrow they
co^uenit with their king in cou^sall and said to him, that they had na litill
wounder, that ye rentis pertenand to ye crown mycht nocht suffice als weill to
him hauand his realm but any trudill in peace. As it did to other may nobill
princis his progenitouris before both in weir and peace. The nobill Galdus
(that recouerit his realm) desyrit neuir stent of thaym for na manner of
chargis that he sustenit aganis hes ennymes. Knawyng weil how odius it was to
the pepyl to seik any new exactionis on thaym. And it the governance of Conarus
was unlike to the nobyll Galdus. For Galdus be counsall of prudent men remouit
all prouocatioun of lustis fra his army with all other thingis yat micht maik
thaym effemynate, geuand his lauboure to defend his subdittes, and to resist
his ennymes. Be contrar Conarus was drownit i^ lust, passing his life ama^g
may vile and abhomynabyll creaturis, pretending ay to govern the realm
(quhen hieast besynes occurrit) ^e their unhappy counsall, disherysing the
nobyllis of the realm to maik up his myscheuous lymmares. And fynaly after sa
money importabyll wrangis done be him, he had socht ane thing richt uncouth and
odius to thaym, to be ane preparatyue to other kyngis his successouris in times
cumyng to seik new exactionis on thaym, that all their riches and guddis micht
cum fynaly in his ha^dis. Bot his unhappy counsalouris and mysgidaris of ye
realm sall nocht only be frustrate of their intentionis. Bot brocht to sic
estait, that they sall myster little reward or riches fra him in times cumyng.
For they war profoundly resoluit both to degraid him of his kingdom and
honouris. And to punys hes wickit consalouris to the deith. That all pepyl of
vile and obscure lynnage may take exempill to abuse realms and kyngis, and
that kyngis may understand quhat dangeir is to thaym to be iniurius tyrannis to
thayr subdittis. Conarus heirand their wourdis said. How dar e mischant fulis
pretend sic thyngis aganis me and my seruandis, This treason (that ^ have
deuisit aganis me) sall turn in damage of our self. And e sall be punyst in
may cruel manner that may be deuisit. The nobillis answerit that he was
unworthy to be yair king. For he sufferit the realm to be distroyit be
insolence of vicious lymmers. Incontinent raise ane huge noys and clamor amang
thaym. And in ye mean time certane wycht and rank men tuke him be the myddill.
And bure him perforce to ane quiet chalmer quhare he remanit ye residew of his
dayis in misery. His seruandis (yat were occasioun of his corrupit life
nurisand him in vice) were taken and hynggit on Iebaittis as they deseruit.

How Argadus was maid gouernou^ of Scotland during the time of Conarus in
presoun. And of his life and governance. Ca. vii.
COnarus beand degradit in yis manner ye nobillis chesit Argadus capitane of
A^^yle to be governor of ye realm sa lan^ as Conarus was in presoun. This
Argadus in ye beginning of his auctorite tuke great laubour for ornament of
commoun weill. And stanchit thift, reif, and slauchter, and all other sic
exhorbitant crimes with meruellus craft and prudence. Hauand sic moderatioun,
that he semyt nothir to slaw nor it to cruel in administratioun of Justice.
Throw quhilk he was traistit to be ane myrrour of virtew to all nobill
princis. And it (as often occurris) good forton turnyt his mind fra Justice. For
he set aside al good maneris, and gouernit his realm (quhen hieast chargis
occurrit) be domistik counsall. And nurist seditionis intestyne betuix ye great
princis of his realm to cause thaym have the may erandis with him. He maryit
the prince of Fiffis douchter. And be affinite yair of drew the Pychtis to his
freindschip, yat he mycht ^e y^ more strange amang his awin pepill. The nobillis
impacient to suffer his vicis, callit him to ane counsall, quhare he was
scharply repreuit, that he chosyn governor be their auctorite for the virtew
than apperyng in him should make him nocht only to follow the vicious tyranny
of Conarus (quhom yai depriuit for his detestabil deeds) bot als to mary with
uncouth blude but their auyse, and gidyng the realm be private counsall to the
great damage of the common weil. And hes tynt schamefully the good (...) that he
conquest before in the beginning of his auctorite. Argadus heirand him reprochit
in this wi^e* et forth money teres and desirit his nobillis to have him excusit
for ya^ time be yair beniuolence, and nocht to punys him according to his
demeritis. For he promittit to amend al enormiteis done be him in quhat sort
they plesit. The nobillis mouit be his humyll wourdis continewit him still in
auctorite, and kest al his counsalouris in presoun. Argadus correckit be his
nobillis in this manner gouernit the realm in good Justice, and did na thing in
times cu^myng concerning publik materis without consultatioun of his nobillis.
And because diverse townis and cieteis of the realm had ouir large preuilege in
administratioun of Justice, he minist money of yair prerogat^uis, and commandit
thaym to punis na thing bot small crimes. all hie offencis to be replegit to
his gre^ Justice. He maid extreme deligence to search theuis, reuaris, and
oppressouris specially thaym that maid heirschippis in Argyle, Ilis, and other
partis adjacent. And ay quhare they were apprehendit they were hyngit but any
mercy on Iebaittis. He commandit all personis (that had any office or auctorite
of him) to abstene fra sic thyngis as mycht make thaym inebriat or dronkin, to
cause thaym have sum preeminence and wisdom above the commonis. He commandit
al scudlaris, tauernaris dronkartis and other siclike vile pepill deuisit more
for lust, than any necessar sustenance of men to be exilit within ane certane
day. The day beand run, he commandit their guddis to be confiscat quhare euir
they mycht be apprehendit. Finalie the commoun pepil sum part be beniuolence of
Argadus, and sum part be their institutionis were reformit in gudde maneris,
quhill at last Conarus be lang se^knes and malancoly (quhilk he tuke for his
incarceration) deceissit the.xiiii. eir of his regne, Anthonius Aurelius beand
than empriour.

Of king Ethodius the first and how he pecifyit the Ilis, How the scottis and

EFtir deith of Conarus the nobillis be general co^uention maid Ethodius king.
For he was nepot to Mogallus gottin on his sister. Ethodius eftir his
coronation rewardit Argadus governor with landis and riches, for his good

At his returnyng i^ Albion he was aduertist, that the Romany had brokin down

Uictoryne that this last pray of guddis was takin be Romany to recompens
syndry other heirschippis maid before be scotis and pichtis. For they war ane
seditious pepyl and confiderat only for damage of their nichtbouris as apperit
cleirly, because they brak first y^ said wall of Adrian, and beildit syndry
strenthis fornens the samyn to trubyll the Romany and Britonis but any sycht

reddy as was desyrit, The Romany weil aduertist of their materis, prouydit ane
huge ordinance of battall aganis their ennymes. The confiderat pepyl rasit
their armyis at the day prefixed, and brak down the wall of Adrian in money
partis, and enterit with may cruel heirschippis and slauchter in the landis
of Romany. In ye nycht followyng the Romany slippit by y^ tentis of Scottis
and Pichtis, and come both in Mers and Berwyk to draw thaym out of the Roman
landis. The confiderat kyngis weil aduertist thairof come with great diligence
on ye morrow to rescours their landis. Incontinent both ye armyis ruschit

gaderit the spuleis of slane men and returnit with the samyn in Scotland. This
battall was sa sorrowful, that the eir nixt followyng was in quiet but any

How Victorine was depriuit of auctoryte, and Calphurnius Agricola send in
his place. How Calphurnius reparit the wal of Adrian, and returnit to Rome.
Ca. ix.
VIctoryne seeing his army brokyn i^ this manner, wrait to Aurelius emprioure*
and schew all this trubyll that fell to Romany be this last battall with every
circumstance before rehersit. The emprioure traistyng this trubyll, fallyn to
Romany be febyll curage of victoryne, depriuit him of all auctoryte, and send
Calphurnius Agricola (quhilk was ^epot to Julius agricola before rehersit) in
his place. Calphurnius at his cumyng i^ Britane assemblit ane large power of
Britonis and Romany at ork to invade the confiderat pepyll. And first maid
sacrifice to the goddis to have victory on his ennymes. Syne rasit his camp and
come beond the wall of Adrian, quhare he fand be frequent weiris all the landis
waist but any cornis or frutis. All the townis brynt be scottis, that na
lugeyng should remane to their ennymes. Calphurnius nochtwithstandyng their
direptionis went forthwart with his army and inuadit both Mers and Pentland
with irrecouerabyl skaithis, and slew the inhabitantis thairof in all partis but
any mercy or ranson. Sic thyngis done he returnit to ork, and remanit their the
winter followyng with the resyd^w of his army makand prouysion (...) the
scottis and pichtis agane the nixt symer In the mean time he (...) ^etteris,
that Welche men with syndry other pepyll of Brytane were reb^llit. And be the
said rebellyoun money cieteis and townis that stude at the opinioun of Romany
brynt and heryit, and the inhabitantis thairof ^^uelly slane. Calphurnius
dreidand to tyne the landis conquest before be sa huge difficulte in persewt of
new rowmis, left ye Scottis and Pichtes and maid him with all diligence to
renew the wall of Adrian, that the samyn mycht be ane targe in times cu^myng
aganis the violence of Scottis and Pychtis. Sone after he gat syndry craftismen
to clenge the fowseis and to repair the said wall in all partis with touris and
bastaileis rysyng in the strangest manner that mycht be deuisit. And quhen the
wall was reparit in all partis, he left ane band of weirmen to debait ye samyn
fra violence of ennymes, and went with the resydew of his army on the Welche
men. And they with na les diligence met him in arrayit battal. Nochtheles they
war fynaly vincust and chasit. Skarsly was this battall pecifyit, quhen
haistely followit ane other be rebellyoun of the I Will of Wycht. The inhabitantis
thairof come with proud baner aganis the Romany, and war vincust on the same
manner as before. The co^fiderat pepyll seand the Brytonis dantit in this wise,
held thaym in their awin rowmes but any inuasyoun of Romany, dreidand ye samyn
chance of victory in this Calphurnius Agricola, that was before with Julius
Agricola. Quhilk subdewit sa money regionis of Scottis and Pychtis to Roman
empire. Calphurnius heirand be their exploratouris how the confiderat pepyll war
skalit but any molestatioun done to his pepyll, maid him to meis al seditionis
(gif any war rysyng) amang the Brytonis. And quhen he had pecifyit thaym on all
debaittis he returnit be command of Anthonius Commodus empriour of Rome.

How Trebellius was send in Britane, and was vincust be the scottis and
pichtis. Of the rebellion of Britonis aganis him, and of his message send to
the empriour. Ca. x.
After the departing of Calphurnius, ane new capitane namit P. Trebellius was
send in Brytane be the Emprioure.

This Trebellius gouernit Brytane mair be beniuolence and favor than any
auctoryte. He vsit the counsall of Britonis in his hie besynes and did great
honor to Lucius king of Britonis, co^mendyng him oftymes be his wrytyngis to
the emprioure, that he was both luffer of the commoun weil of Rome, and ennyme
to all thaym that hatit ye empire thairof. Trebellius come in sic favor to
Lucius king of Britonis be their co^me^dationis, that he beleuit na thing micht
succeed to his damage in Britane. And began thairfore to schaw his feneit mind
as man of insaciabyll avarice. For he slew money rich men in Britane only to
confisk their gudis, and otheris banist to ye same effect. Their cruelteis maid
him sa odius, that he had been oftymes inuadit and slane, war nocht he was
ythandly supportit be the said Lucius. The confiderat pepil knawing the hatrent
of Britonis aganis Trebellius, thocht the time expedient to revenge auld
iniuris. And after that they had gaderit ane army with all prouysyoun (that
mycht be deuysit) they brak down the wall of Adriane quhilk was reparit afor be
Calphurnius* and wrocht intollerabyl cruelteis on the Britonis, that obeit to
romany. Trebellius mouit be their displesouris went with ane army of horsemen
and futemen aganis ye scottis and pichtis. At his first iunyng ye Britonis and
French men (quhilkis were ane great part of his army) left him. Throw quhilk he
was esaly vincust, and all his army put to flycht. And yocht ye victory
succedit to scottis and pichtis in this battall it innowmerabyl slaucht was
maid on thaym als well as of romany. Trebellius dyscomfyst on this manner,
colleckit the resydew of his army, and returnit to ork. The scottis and pichtis
become richt insolent after this victory. And to revenge ye slauchter sa money
eris maid on thaym, they slew all the presoneris, quhilkis war takin in yis last
field, And come with new army on the pepyl yt dwelt in Westmureland and
Kendale, and inuadit yame with sic cruelte, yt they war disparit but refuge.
Howbeit Trebellius was gretumly commouit at their offencis, he durst nocht
assail his ennimes with battall* for he had na les suspection aganis ye
Britonis than aganis the scottis and pichtis. Nochtheles be frequent ieoperdyis
he slew his ennymes ay quhare he mycht apprehend thaym but any miseration. In
ye samyn time raise mekyll trubyll in Britane. For ye co^monis seeing thaym ylk
day mair iniurit be ye scottis and pichtis but any esperance of redres, chesit
Caldorus ane vaileant knycht of pichtis blude to be their capitane in their
rebellion. For he was money eris accustomit with their maneres, hauand na thing
in mair hatrent, than tyranny of Romany. Trebellius knawing ye great dangeir
appering be this trubyll, tuke lang consultation be quhat industry and laubour
he mycht best resist thairto. After degeist aduisement, he tuke purpos to fecht
with Britonis. For gif their power war midli^ with scottis and pichtis, ye
samyn mycht not be dantit but great slauchter of romany. The Britonis (because
their army was colleckit of commonis) were astonist be his cu^myng. Nochtheles
be impulsion of Caldorus their capitane, they iunit with their ennimes in great
ferocite and spreit. Followit ane bludy and terribyll battall fochtin with
doutsum victory. Bot at last ye britonis war vincust. Caldorus eschapit out of
yis battal with certane his freindis and returnit i^ Pentland, reiosing i^ his
mind that sa money Romany and Britonis were slane be his industry. Money nobillis
of Britane were in these field aganis y^ Romans. Howbeit they were cloithit under
landwart habyt. And quhen they saw the Romany be rageand fury sla sa money of
ye co^monis, they discouerit yame self to Romany, traistyng (because they were
nobillis) to be ye erar saissit and taken presoneris. Quhen Trebellius was
aduertist how they dissimulit their habyt, and were the cause of this rebellion,
he gart hing yame in presens of all the pepill on Iebai^is. This cruelte maid
Trebellius ^^cht odious to ye Britonis. For on the morrow they tuke als money
Romany and hangit thaym on the samyn manner. Trebellius dreding great dangeir
apperyng in all partis, (...) to the emprioure of the trea^^^ of Britonis and
iniuris done be Sco^tis and Pychtis. And desyrit support to be send haistely,
or ellis ye Romany should be doung schamefully out of Britane. Comodus Anthonius
empriour to dant yis rebellion of Britonis, Scottis and Pychtis, send ane
vaileaunt knycht namyt Pertenar in Britane. Quhilk eftir his cumyng dantit the
ennymes of Roman empire mair be beniuloe^ce than any preis of armies. Howbeit
ane certane of thaym (yt were of small reputatioun) were punyst to ye deith Eftir
yis he rasit his camp, and combeond the wall of Adriane, quhare he inuadit the
Scottis and Pichtis with heirschippis and slauchter, bot quhen he should have
procedit forwart. He gat writyngis, that Commodus emprioure was slane be
treason of his famyliaris. And sone eftir he returnyt to Rome, quhare he was
chosin emprioure, and eftir his coronatioun Trebellius was send agane in
Britane.

How Argadus lieutenand to king Ethodius was slane and his army discomfist in
the Ilis. Of syndry lavvis and actis maid be Ethodius, and of his slauchter.
Ca. xi.
QUhil sic thingis were done in Britane, succedit great trubyll to Ethodius in
Scotland. For sindry great Clannis of the Ilys to revenge ye slauchter of their
freindis (quhilkis were slane be Argadus quhen he was governor) ariuit with ane
great power in Argyle, and maid slauchter and heirschippis in all partis thairof
but any miseratioun of estait. Ethodius to punys their attemptatis, send Argadus
his lieutenand with ane cumpany of chosyn men in Argyle, and come with ane army
both of Scottis and Pichtis to the wall of Adriane to fecht with Romans and
Britonis gyf they wald inuaid him. The Clannis of ye Ilis knawyng the cumyng of
Argadus conuenit suddanlie wi^h their capitane to meit him. And left two.M.
Ireland men (quhilkis come with thaym for spule) hid under cragges and couis of
that land to take Argadus (gyf they mycht) at su^ aua^tage. Als sone as their
Ireland men persauit Argadus cumyng by thaym. They ruschit al atanys apo^ him
with ane schout. Argadus seeing him inuadit on athir side, turnyt all dredour in
may fury, and faucht with incredibill manheid to the deith. And was finalie
slane with.ii. thousand men of his army. And the residew put to flycht. King
Ethodius become rycht displesant to the Clannys of ye Ilis for this offense.
For he come sone eftir with.xx. thousand men in Argyle. The clannis of the Ilis
aduertist of his cumyng, pullit up salis to have fled in ye Ilis. Nochtheles
they were dreuin agane in Argyle with contrarius wyndis. King Ethodius knawyng
thaym disparit men, and nocht abill to be vincust but hie damage and slauchter
of his pepil, brak thaym mair be wisdom than any violence of battall. And
brocht thaym to sic necessite, that they were co^stranit for falt of vittallis
to seik peace, quhilk was grantit to thaym under their co^ditionis. Ye
principal capitane and two hundredth (quhom ye king wald cheis of their
cumpany) salbe deliuerit to underly ye will of him and his nobillis. And ye
remanent to return hame but their swerdis in the Ilis. Their Clannys and men of
the Ilis seeing na refuge tuke peace on the samyn condition, and deliuerit sa
money as the king plesit, quhilkis were Iustifyit and pu^ to deith. The residew
seeing their capitane and their freindis slane, come with ane huge nowmer of
stanis (because they wantit their swerdis) on the kyngis army. As rammist and
wod creaturis to have reuengit ye slauchter of yair freindis. Nochtheles ane
great end of thaym with litill lauboure was slane and ye remanent put to flicht.
The Ilis dantit on this manner, and ye Britonis leuand in servitude under
romany, Ethodius had his realm i^ peace but any uncouth or domistik weiris
money eris eftir. And eftir yt he had visit all boundis thairof, he chesit
sindry prudent men to be Iugis for administratioun of Justice to his subdittis.
And that he should nocht dull be approchyng of age in sleuth, he gave his ingyne
to huntyng. As he was lernit in his outh. And commandit the lawis maid before be
his nobill antecessouris concerning hu^ting to be obseruit. And first he
co^mandit yt na haris be slane (quhen they ar lyand) with clubbis, arowis,
dartis, or any siclik instrumentis. Nor it taken be nettis or girnis, because
haris were oftymes murdrist be sic manner but any game. He commandit als gyf ye
haris had forrun the hundis be lang renk, to be na forthir persewit. Siclike
that na man sla ane baggit Hynd, nor it their calffis. It was defendit als to
sla ane hair with any other ingyne than chase of hundis, and na huntyng to be
vsit during the season of winter and Ueir. For in that season the erd is so
ouir couerit with snawis, that the deir ar constranit to descend fra the
montanis to the planis to search their fude, and oftymes murdrist but any game.
Their lawis were maid be Ethodius. For he detestit na thing mair, than the
honorabill game of huntyng (quhilk was ordanit for his nobillis and gentill
men) to be distroyit be sic febill slychtis but solace. Attoure quhen yis
prince vakit fra his hu^tyng, he was geuin to honest pleseiris, and nurist with
him crafty menstralis of all sortis Bot at last he was treasonably slane under
nycht be ane menstrale of the Ilis, quhome he had in great delight. This
menstrale was fynalie taken be the kyngis guard, and quhen he was accusit, quhy
he slew hes native price yat was so familiar and tendir with him, he answerit
that he slew the king, because the king slew money of his freindis before in
Argyle. And sen he had so condingly reuengit ye slauchter of his freindis,
quhilk he was determyt money dayis before to do, And his vehement affectioun
satifyit be his vaileant deid, he desyrit to leif na la^gar. And bad thaym use
quhat cruelte they list, for his offense. For his curage was na les reddy to
sustene the deith tha^ it was to sla the king. Attoure their was na kind of
deith sa cruel to be deuysit on him, that mycht cause him to repent the kyngis
slauchter, sen he be the samyn hes so co^dynglie reuengit the slauchter of his
deir freindis Skarsly were their wourdis said be the said menstrale, quhen his
body was drawin sindry with wyld horse. Ethodius was slane the.xxxiii. eir of

of so tender age, yat they mycht nocht succeid. And thairfore Satrahell his
brothir was maid king. This Satrahell was ane man of sle and falls ingyne, and
geuin to sic cruelte and treason, That he slew be feneit causis money of all the

Of king Donald the first. How the Britonis were inhibit be the Romany to
have any king of their blude. And how they solistit the Scottis and Pichtis to

SAtrahell slane in yis manner, Donald brothir to Ethodius the first was maid
king, ane Just and humyl prince rych^ far discordand fra the maneris of the
last tyrane, nocht geuyn to slychtis nor falset. Bot settand his mind to meis

realm of all debaitis, he began to vesy all boundis thairof makand residence

necligence of evil princis) was brocht to civil maneris. And abyll to
withstand their ennymes quhen dangeir occurrit. This nobil prince had ane guard
of chosyn men reddye for all chargis both in time of weir and peace. About
this time Lucius king of Britonis deceissit. The Romany eftir his deith
knawyng the kyngis of Britane was occasioun of sa frequent seditioun in times
bygane, Inhibit that any of their blude should regne in times cumyng. Throw
quhilk great trubill succedi^ in Britane. For Fulgencius (quhilk was discendit
of ye blude riall of Britane) rycht co^mouit that the noblis thairof should be
disherist of ye crown, conuenit money of the nobillis their of to ane counsall.
And complenyt ye gre^ tyrannyis done be Romany in plane euersioun of their

The Britonis mouit with yir reasonis, set ane day to meit him in their best
manner to invade the Romany. Sone eftir Fulgencius send ane herald to Donald
king of Scottis, schawyng ye rebellioun of Britonis aganis the Romany, and
desyryng support to expel thaym out of Albioun. For ye samyn mycht be done yat

And maid incursionis with heir^chippis and slauchter on all pepill that obeit

TRebellius Impacient to suffir their offencis, wrait to Seuerus emprioure. How

of ye world, tuke his wayage on ane horse litter. And come finalie with great
lauboure and dylygence (howbeit he was agit and pynit with ye gout) in Britane.
And brocht with him both his sonnis, Anthonius and Getas to that fine, that he
mycht draw thaym fra corrupit and sensual plesouris to merciall werkis. At his
cumyng in Britane, he gaderit ye residew of Romany with his new army to inuaid

suddane cummyng of the emprioure with ane huge power, send oratoures to excuse

outragis sa money eris done be Romany. And declarit how na thing mycht move him
to take this may dangerus matter on hand. Bot only to recover ye liberte of
Britane, and to banis uncouth blude fra ye croun. And yocht he persuadit thaym

come out of Britane with their wiffis, children and guddis to the montanis
beond the wall of Adriane. In ye mean time Fulgentius gaderit ane cumpany of
the noblest Britonis of his opinion, with purpos erar to defend thaym self than

Adriane, and of the empriouri^ deith. Ca. xv.
THe Scottis and pichtis brokin with yis calamity, send in Ireland, Norway,
and Denmerk for support of freindis to resist the Romany. And Fulgentius on
the tothir side ceissit not to hyre all pepill (ya^ he mycht get) for money.
Eftir this battall the empriour Seuerus past throw all boundis of Britane. And
slew all the nobillis thairof (quhom he mycht apprehend) hauand miseratioun
only on the commonis.

For they did no offense, bot followit their maisteris. Als sone as he had
reparit all dammagis done be necligence of febyll capitanis, he retournyt to
ork. And left his army in their winter schelis. In the nixt symer the Scottis
and Pichtis seand na support come fra Ireland, set thaim era^ to defend their
awin* than to invade their ennymes. Fulgentius with the Brytonis (that stude at
his opinioun) in esperance of better fortoun fled to the Scottis and Pichtis.
Sone after Seuerus emprioure rasit his camp, and come beonde the wall of
Adriane. Throw quhilk the empriour began nocht allanerly to favor the crystyn
pepyll. Bot als inhibit any persecutioun to be maid on thaym, and kepit the
crucifix in the may secret partis of his chalmer. In the samyn time was
Plotinus with money other clerkis of syngular eruditioun sum gentilis, and su^
of thaym crystyn pepyll. This was the first time that the Scottis began to leir
Theologe and haly writ be clerkis quhilkes war send be Uictor the pape for
their eruditioun in Albion.

Of king Ethodius the secund, and how the nobyllis fyndyng him ^nabyll to gyde
the realm, gouernit the samyn be their auctorite in great (...) Ca. xvii.
DOnald deceissit in this manner. Ethodius the secund of that name, son to
Ethodius the first was maid king, he was nurist in the I Will of Man under the
wise preceptouris thairof. Howbeit it was vncertane in quhat maneris he wald
incres, quhen he was put to lyberte. For quhen he was declarit king and freely
delyuerit of his preceptouris, he apperit of dull ingyne mair abyll to gadder
riches be his insaciabyll avarice. than to govern ane realm. And because the
nobyllis pers^uit him of evil governance, they gydit the realm be their
prudent constitutionis. Good Justice followit, and prudent men put in every
schyre both to punis criminal personis, and to keep the pepyll but any
extorsionis. Sic diligence was maid yat misdoaris war punist, and na man punist
bot according to the lawis. It was defendit be the samyn, to speak for any
criminal personis in judgment. And he that spoke for the said personis war
reput as participant with their crime. Attoure quhare any trubyll apperit be
seditioun, the samyn was haistely m^sit. The Britonis leuit all this time in
good peace under trybute of Romany, and durst pretend na rebellyoun aganis
thaym. For Seuerus emprioure tuke sic pleggis of thaym before his deith, that
they war constranit to leif in peace. Siclike the Scottis and Pychtis during
the time of Ethodius nothir did nor tuke iniure of Romany nor Britonis. Quhyll
at last king Ethodius was slane be his guard the.xvi. eir of his regne, because
he was ouir mekyll geuyn to auaricious gadering. And sa endis heir the fifth
buke of their ^roniklis.

Heir begynnis the sext Buke of the croniklis of Scotland:
How Athirco was maid king of scottis. How the nobyllis conspirit aganis him
for his cursit tyrannyis. and how he slew him self be disperation. Ca. primo.
NOcht lang after the slauchter of Ethodius, the nobillis co^uenit to publik
cou^sall and maid Athirco son of Ethodius before deceissit, king, and yocht he
was ou^g, it he was dispe^sit be ye nobilles notwithstanding his age. He
apperit in the beginning of his empire prudent and gratius to his subdittis,
delytyng in doctrine of letterit me^ sic as knew the haly wryt or the hystory
of his progenitouris. He was weill exercit in werslyng and all other corporal
exercition cumyng be ingyne or strenth of body, and sa lyberal yat he tyistit
the pepyll to his favor. And it he grew nocht in virtew as he grew in age.
For after yat he had roung.viii. eris, he become ylk day mair vnplesand and ay
ye mair vicious yat he procedit in eris* like ane monsture degenerat fra al
honest exercitionis, geuyn to vnsaciabyll avarice, and doing ylk thing mair be
Ire or dredur, tha^ be beniuolence or good counsal. Thus tint he be avarice, all the freindis yat he conquest before be his liberalite. And nocht only was he
i^uoluit with their crimes, bot with all kind of corruppit vice and lust yt
micht make him effeminat. And tuk sic delight in syngaris, sportouris, and
menstralis, yat he eschamit nocht to pas in sycht of all the pepyll playing on
ane flute. The nobyllis thouch^ unworthy, to be gouernit be sic ane monsture
that desyrit erar to schaw him ane fydlar than ane virtuous prince. And war
commouit eik that oung me^ be his wykit exempyl war ylk day mair drownit in
lust to the damage of their commoun weill and laik of Justice, seand their
king sa inuoluit with every kind of vice, that he tuke na solicitude of the
governance of his realm. Bot gaif occasioun ylk day mair and mair aganis him.
Than was in Argyle ane man of great auctorite namyt Nathalak, quhilk had two
douchteris of excellent beawte. Athirco aduertist of thaym be his corruppit
rutouris, ceissit nocht quhyll he had deflorit thaym both* And quhen his lust
was saciat, he causit his mischeuous rebaldis to fule thaym on the samyn manner.
Nathalak herand yir cruelteis done to his dochteris, seirchit his ingyne be
quhat way he micht best revenge the samyn. And in ye mean time he maid
consolatioun to his douchteris, knawing weill their bodyis mair violat than
their myndis. On the morrow he conuenit his freindis to ane counsal, and
complanit heuyly ye defloration of his dochteris. Incontinent all his allia and
freindis ruschit to harnes, and maid solemn votis to punis this tyrane for
his demeritis. On the morrow money of al ye nobyllis assistit to their opinion,
and com to dou^stafage, quhare this vicius king remanit for ye time. The nois
and ratlyng of armit men maid na lytyl effray amang the commonis at thayr first
cumyng. Nochtheles fra ye cause was mai^fest of yair asse^blance the pepyl
gaderit fast out of all partis to assist to thaym. Few was than in that army,
that thocht nocht both this tyrane worthy to be degradit of auctorite, and
punist to the knawlege of all his petitionis, and said the empire of king
Nathala^ sall have ane haisty and myserabyll end, be ane of his may
famyliaris. This Murray nocht content of sa general responce, prayit her to
schaw his name in special that should sla ye king. Scho answerit, thou sall sla
him. Than this Murray began to chyde with the wyche, saying thou can deuyne
nocht bot sayis (as thou pleis) be flattery or malice. Thou sall be falls, for I
sall refuse na kind of deith or I attempt sa odius cruelte. This Murray hauand
na other answer was richt astonist, and maid him to return to the king. it
before his cumyng to the king, he changi^ purpos often reuoluyng in his mind,
quhat dangeir mycht follow gyf he (...) ye answer (as ye wyche schew) (...)
king, often musand the good and the ^^yl thairof, and knawyng weill in quhat
da^geir he stude, gif ye king tuke any suspitioun of him. After lang musyng, he
was fullely resoluit erar to sla the king (as the wiche schew) than ay to leif
in dangeir of his ly^e. At last quhe^ he was cumyn to the kyngis secret
chalmer allone with the king* he began be lang circumstance to schaw the
wounderful slychtis and operatioun of this wyche. In the mean time the king was
sa trublyt be flux of wambe, that he was co^stranit haistely to pas to his eyes.
Als sone as this Murray saw the king at quiet, he pullit forth his dageir and
drove ye king to ye heart, suspeckand na thing les tha^ sic treason, and kest
his body down in the closet. Syne stall away be ane private postrome, and was
the first man that schew the deith of the king to his conspiratouris. This end
maid Nathalak ye.xi. eir of his regne fra the Incarnatioun.ii.C.lii. eris. In
the time of Galienus the may febil empriour that was before him. for in his
time.xxx. tyrannis inuadit the commoun weill of Rome with great afflictionis but

Of king Fyndok, and how he dantit the Ilis, and was slane be tvva men
thairof. Ca. iii.
NAthalak the tyrane slane on this manner ye nobyllis send this Murray in
Pentland to bring ye three sonnis of Athirco to Dounstafage. And ye eldest of
thaim namyt Fyndok ane lusty and vaileant prince was maid king. He kepit good
peace with his nychtbouris the Romany and Britonis. And conquest freindis mair
be beniuolence, tha^ any feir of mynassyng. Bot (as often fallis amang ws) lang
peace intertenit with uncouth pepyll, generis civil contentionis amang our
self. Donald of the Ilis (to revenge the slauchter of Nathalak) come with ane
great power i^ Murray and Ros, to the great heirschippis and slauchter of the
pepyll. Because they fauorit ye slaa^is of Nathalak his friend. Fyndok to punis
their attemptatis, come haistely in the Ilis, and faucht with Donald, and put
him to flycht. Donald discomfist in this manner, fled to the sees, quhare he
fand ane bait, and enterit with sic multitude of folkis, that scho sank within
ane mile to land, And all the pepil in her perist. Howbeit the men of the Ilis
war brokin be this chance of battal, they ceissit nocht fra their vndantit
malice* Bot che^^t Donald (quhilk was son to Donald before perist) to be thayr
capitane. And inuadit ye cuntre with mair trubyl than before. Fyndok to punys
their conspiratouris, returnit in the Ilis, and slew all ye war apprehendit of
their opinioun. Syne kest down the strenthis of the cuntre, that na refuge sall
remane at their returnyng. Donald before the kyngis cumyng fled in Ireland, and
after the kyngis departing returnit in the Ilis. And seand the cuntre heri^^
and his freindis slane, he kest him to do the thing be slycht, yt he mycht
nocht do be force, and send ane messyngeir (as he had been penitent of all
offense) to Fyndok, and desyrit grace. The king mouit of piere condiscendit to
their desyris, sa yt the said Donald come with the principal mouaris of this
rebellion but wappynnis to Dounstafage to underly his will. Donald nocht
content to have peace in this manner, chesit erar to underly the chance of
fortoun, than the kyngis will. And thairfore to co^plet the treasonabyl purpos
be him deuysit, He send two men of subtyle ingyne to Dounstafage to await su^
ganand time to sla the king. Their two men feneit thaym gentle men of ye Ilis,
and ennymes to Donald, And at their first cu^myng they gat little credence. Bot
at last be menis of Carance the kyngis brothir, they war admyttit to ye kyngis
presence, and maid sa famyliar that they war deput be the king to sit both on
his private and publik materis. At last quhen they persauit Carance set in
slauchter of the king, to conques ye crown. They opinnit their mind to him, and
he na thing suspendit their purpos, bot with large promise tyistit thaym mair to
the samyn. Within schort time after ye king went to ane huntung beside
Dou^stafage to sla ane Wolf. And sat down on ane mote, nocht knawing how their
lymmaris war set for his slauchter. At last quhen the faid had brocht in ye
wolf before the houndis the skry arais, and ylk man went to his gam. Thus was
the king left his alone but any cumpany except their two Ilis men. Tha^ ane of
thaym began to hald ye king in talk, quhyll the tothir tratourusly come behynd
him and drove him throw the body with ane hountyng staff. Als sone as their
tratoures had slane ye king, they left ye staf stikand throw his body. The
huntaris returnyng fra their game, and fyndyng ye king slane, followit sa fast
on his slaaris, that they war both takyn, ^ demandit be scharp punytioun for
quhat occasioun they slew ye king. Their tratouris with spreit little affrayit
co^fessit pertly ye crime, schawyng how they war instruckit be Donald of the
Ilis and Carance to sla the king. And quhen they had discouerit ye treason (as
said is) they war both put to may terribyll deith. King Fyndok was slane
the.x. eir of his regne, quhylk was in the time of Floriane empriour. His body
was buryit after the use of cristin princes with great lament of pepyl in ane
rich sepulture nocht far fra Dounstafage.

How Cara^ce was banist for his brotheris slauchter, And Donald the s^cund
maid king. Of his deith, and of syndry nobyll clerkis. Ca. iiii.
CArance the secund son of Athirco, herand the treason sa manifestly
confessi^ be ye slaaris of Fyndok, fled in Italy. Quhair he wan great fame and
honouris in the weris of Dioclesiane and Aurelius Empriouris. As we sall eftir
schaw. Fyndok slane in yis manner, his brothir Donald ye secund of that name,
and third son to Athirco was maid king. This prince was takand auisement of
his nobillis, Be quhat manner he mycht may esalie revenge the slauchter of his
brothir Fyndok. Quhen suddanlie come tythyngis, that ye said Donald of the Ilis
was cumyn in Ros and inuadyng ye pepil thairof with heirschippis and cruelteis.
King Donald mouit for their attemptatis, come haiste^ie in Murray with ane
certane chosin men. And commandit be general proclamatioun under pa^e of deith
al sensabill men to follow him (...) ^ary, at his cumyn in (...) he was bot ane
few nowmer* he partit his army at ane great strenth to abide ye cumyng of the
remanent army. Donald of the Ilis seeing the king of small power tuke purpos to
Ieoperd him to ye chance of fortoun. And but more tarry, he come with sa scharp
battall on the king, that ye king mycht nocht use his ordinance of bowis and
speris. Bot constranyt haistelie to fecht with swe^dis. Followit ane terribill
and scharp bargane. Quhil at last king Donald ouirset with great multitude of
pepyll fechtand aganys him, was taken with.ii.M. me^ of his army, and.iii.
thousand slane. King Donald finalie tuke sic malancoly that he deceissit the
third day eftir that he was taken in the first eir of his regne. In their dayis
were money clerkis of singular eruditioun. As Quintus Tortulianus, that wrait
mekyl aganys the errouris of Gentylis. Pylocratis bischop of Ephesei, in quhais
time was great contentioun concerning ye cerimonys of pasche. Cipriane oratoure
quhilk renuncit the errouris of Gentilis, and become cristin. And eftir wrait
sindry bukis for the eruditioun of cristin pepill.

How money haly men war martyrit for the faith of Crist. How Donald of the
Ilis the third of that name vsurpit the crown* and was slane be Craithlint.
Ca. v.
THe cristin faith sufferit great persecutioun at this time. Money haly men and
women martyrit. As Cipriane, Sextus, Laurence, Hipolitus, Barbara, Cecilia,
Agatha, with money otheris throw tyrany of Decius empriour. And in this time the
Scottis began to be rycht profound in theology and haly writ be doctrine of
certane monkis, Quhilkis were callit in they dayis Culdey, that is to say, the
honoraris of god. For tha^ al preistes ye honorit god war callit culder, their
prestes be general vocis chesit ane bischop to have auctorite and Jurisdiction
above thaym. And he was callit the bischop of scotland. Bot we will return to
our history. Eftir deith of king Donald* great truble followit in the realm.
For Donald of the Ilis, had sa money nobillis taken in this last battall. And
held thaym in sis captivity, that nothir they, nor their freindis durst attempt
any thing aganis his desiris. Throw quhilk he tuke ye crown and nocht only
habandonit all the cuntre, bot thirllit ye nobillis to his assistance Howbeit
they lay ay in wait to sla him, quhen time and place mycht appeir. Donald
knawin yair hatrent aganis him tuke sic feir of his life, that he gaif na man
credit. Bot (as the use of tyrannis is) had every man in suspitioun and
dredour. Thus grew he Ilk day more terribill and odius to his pepill. And
gouernit the realm with na better eil than he gat it. At last his dredour
procedit sa far, that he durst cum in na opin place but guard of armit me^ about
him with halbertis and axis. And inhibit that any other man beir wappynnis
saiffyng his awin guard Finalie he culd nocht be satifyit in his mind quhill he
had slane all thaym that he suspeckit. And confiscat their guddis in favor of
yame that assistit to him. Intendyng (as ane bludy monstoure) to conserve ye
crown with siclike cruelte as he gat it. He slew als money other nobillis be
vane causis to promoue men of vile and obscure lynnage to riches and honouris
but any sycht to virtew. And reiosit in na thing sa mekill as to gener frequent
seditionis amang his subdittis, traistyng be their seditioun to have felicite.
And be their concord to have trubill in his crown. It was said this cruel
tyrane leuch neuir bot quhe^ he hard discord and slauchter of his nobillis And
als sone as he hard ye same, he confiscat all their guddis but any sycht to
wrang or reason. And said oftymes amang his familiaris. Na sycht mycht be mair
plesand to him than to se men murdir other. Attour the slauchter of nobillis
and rich men ar rycht necessar to ye tranquillite of all realms, because they
ar ennymes both to the king and commoun weil. And quhen this tyrane had

Enuerlochte with purpos to pas in the Ilis. Bot he was slane ye first nycht he
come yair be Craith lynt son to king Fyndok before reheirsit the.xii. eir of

how he had put down the tyrane Donald of the Ilys. Restit thairfore ganand
occasioun to revenge the great oppression and cruelteis done sa money eris be his
unhappy counsalouris. The nobillis glaid of this tyrannis slauchter ruschit
haistely to harnes. And slew that samyn nycht.ii.C. of the principal
assistaris to his opinioun and the remanent chasit in Athole. Quhilkis were all
slane sone eftir be the pepill, quhen they were aduertist of Donaldis slauchter.

Of king Craithlynt. And how the Scottis and pichtis fell in contentioun be
their huntyng* and faucht with great slauchter on all sydis. Ca. vi.
DOnald the tyrane slane in yis manner, the crown was restorit to the blude of
Athirco. For Craithlynt son to Findok (because he slew this last tyrane sa
vaileantlie) was maid king. Craithlynt glaid of this felicite gaif thankis to
his subdittes, and detestit be la^g oriso^ before ye cou^sal ye tyranny of
Donald of the Ilis. Usurpar of the crown but any tityll. And gydyng the samyn
with treason, falset, reif and slauchter of nobillis. And exhortit the pepill
(sen this tyrane be his prudence was distroyit) to reiose and to suffir nane of
the said Donaldis blude on live. In adventure they nuris sic displesour to thaym
self be their non aduertence as sum time did king Donald fechtand unwarily with
ye said Donald of ye Ilis. Quhair throw ye nobilite of Scotland was oppressit
xii. eris with sic tyrannyis, that na man mycht resist the samyn. And for their
reasonis he desyrit thaym to assist to him to repare all oppressionis done be
cruelte of the said Donald of the Ilis. Quhilk thyngis beand done all materis
mycht succeed with in schort time as they desyrit. The nobillis na les mouit be
his excellent beawte and lustynes of person, than be his wordis, swore to take
his part in all materis. Nocht lang after al ye lynnage of Donald Ilis was socht
in all partis and slane but any difference of their estait. Sic thyngis done
Craithlint chesit wise and (...) men to do Justice throw al bou^di^ of his
realm. Syne past with ane certane his nobyllis to the montanis of Gra^ebene to
pas his time in huntyng. In the mean time come to him ye ambassatouris of
Thelargus king of Pichtis, schawing him reiosit, yt ye tyrane Donald of ye Ilis
was ^lane, and the crown restorit to the natyue blude. And desyrit thairfore
the auld band of peace to be renewit for the weill of both their realms. Their
desyris war plesandly grantit, and the ambassatouris honorably depeschit. Nocht
lang after certane nobyllis of Pichtis come to hunt with the king in Granebene.
The Pichtis in their huntyng stentit strange nettis on lesuris and medois, and
drove the hertis apone the nettis with their hundis. And quhe^ ye beistes
eschapit, they cloithit thaym with bra^chis and leuis of treis lik stalkaris,
sine slew the deir with braid arrowis and dartis, quhen they war lyand weary.
The scottis na thing content of this game (because it was co^trar their lawis)
gart remove their nettis and hunt on their manner, takand the pray be swift
hou^dis allanerly. The Pichtis seand their hou^dis of les reputatioun than ye
scottis both in bewte, swiftnes, lang renk, and hardyment, desyrit ane certane
of every kind of hou^dis to be geuyn to thaym, yt the samyn micht be bred amang
thaym self. And quhen they had gottyn every kind yairof geuyn to thaym (as they
desyrit) they stale ane certane houndis, and went ham^ with ye samyn but any

ane quhyte hound plesand and mair spedy tha^ any other. Quho^ Craithlint had i^
may delight. The master of hu^tis astonyst throw ye wantyng of this hound,
followit sa scharply yt he fand ye samyn, and was sa fervent i^ recoueryng

maid ye nobillis and co^monis of scotland to return i^ may fury to revenge
ye same. The Pichtis on ye samyn manner gaderit on the tothir side with na les
fury to resist. Throw quhilk followit ane haisty and myscheuus battall with
great slauchter on ilk side, nane of thaym knawing ye motive nor occasion
thairof. In this unhappy bergane were slane.lx. scotts gentyl men with great
nowmer of co^monis. And of Pichtis mo than ane hundredth. The fame of this
unhappy battall diuulgat in the cuntre, mouit ye freindis of thaym (that war
slane) to seik vengeance with mair hatrent than before. Thus gaderit they agane
on al sydis, and faucht but capitane, baner, or ordour of cheuelry neir to the
vter destruction of thaym both. Alwayis ye scottis war disco^fist.iii.M. of

How Carance brothir to Findok returnit out of Italy with great riches i^
Albion. How he conquest vvestmureland, and maid peace betuix Scottis and
Pychtis. Ca. vii.
THelargus king of Pichtis richt agit and nere consumit he eris, was sorrowful
for this contention falling betuyx the two pepyll sa lang confiderat, cumyn be
suddane pertinacite of vndantit personis. And send hes oratoures to Craithlint,
schawand him na les displesit for the slauchter and trubyll falling to Scottis,
than to his awin pepyl, for the same tendit to the damage of both their
commoun welis. Attoure na crime micht be impute to him. For he neuir consentit
thairto. And sen ye said trubyll was cumyn mair be private than publict
auctorite, he thoucht y^ pepyll sa lang confiderat, should put end to their
weres, and have peace with other. For gif they perseuerit with Ire and hatrent
aganis other, nocht sal follow bot vter ruin of both their realms, and ye
samyn to fall in pray to romany. Forthir he was reddy to repair al offense and
iniuris done be his pepil to scottis, and desyrit to have peace, y^ both ye
pepil micht erar return to concord for defense of their realms, tha^ to
perseueir i^ battallis to ye final euersion of thaym both. The scottis war sa
impacient for ye recent slaucht maid on thaym be Pichtis, yt their oratouris
micht skarsly purches license to schaw their message. Nochtheles they gat
finaly presence* and schew yair desyris to Craithlint in manner before rehersit.
It was answerit be king Craithlint, that na thing micht cu^ sa displesand to
him as suddane trubill falling amang* they pepil, quhilkis hes been so la^g
confiderat togidder i^ amite and blude. And youcht peace war mair plesand to

awin auctorite three monethis trewis, yt the nobillis of both their realmis may
be profou^dly resoluit to pas and repas to decerne quhat is to be done. The
trewis taken in this manner war pleasant to the king of Pichtis, beleuyng
thairthrow to put ane end to their debaittis and to all displesoures following
be ye same. it nochtwithstanding their trewis sindry incursionis war maid on
athir side. Quhill sic thyngis occurrit betwix scottis and pichtis, Carance the
secund brothir to Findok (quhome we schew banist before for his slauchter) wa^
great honouris i^ Italy. This Cara^ce after his proscripption was ane man of
armis in the roman weris, howbeit nane knew his nobil blude* and wan sic fame
be his manheit^ and proves, that na capitane was repute mair worthy to haif
chargis be the empriour. Nocht lang after this Carance was send be Dioclesiane
empriour with ane flote of schippis to defend the costis of Normandy and
picardy fra iniure of saxones franche men and other pirattis, quhylkis inuadit
the samyn with frequent iniuris. At his cumyng he wald noch^ ieopard him aganis
his ennymes. Quhil they war ladyn full of riches and guddis, to that fine that
fra the pray war taken he mycht be enrichit their with. it because he nothir
delyuerit the pray thairof to ye empriour nor his capitanis, he was haldyn
suspect, and persewit to the deith. Als ^one as Carance understood the empriour
mouie with sic hatrent aga^^s him, he pullit up salis, and come (...) his
weirmen and riches be the (...) seis in Westmureland ane (...) of Britane nocht
far fra the la^^^s of scottis and pichtis, traistyng to have sum rescours of
thaym aganis the Romany. Sone after he set his army on land, and with small
difficulte gat all the pepyl thairof randerit to him. Sic thingis done he send
his oratouris to Craithlint his nepot, schawand (youcht he was banist for
suspitioun of the slauchter of his brothir Fyndok be inuy of wikit personis and
brocht in great misery and trubyl thairthrow). it he was innocent thairof, and
had gouernit him sa wysly after syndry chargis geuyn to him be the empriour,
that he was send with ane flote of schippis to pecify the occiane seis. And be
the samyn hes won great honor and riches. it because the empriour was mouit
aganis him be inuy of detractoures, he was cumyng with sic army and riches in
Westmureland, yt he hes brocht ye inhabitantis thairof to his opinion. Thus had
he ferme esperance (gif the scottis and pichtis wald co^cur with him) to ding
the Romany out of Albion. For the power of Romany was daily wastit in
Britane. And sa great rebellyon maid aganis thaym in all partis, that they mycht
send na support in Britane. Thus mycht the scottis and pichtis have ane ganand
time to dyng the Romany out of Britane, and to keep him their natyue blude in
the empire thairof. Swa they wald remove all hatrent and sedition rysyn amang
thaym, and have peace with other. Craithlynt thocht the kyndnes of his eme
Carance nocht to be refusit, s^and him cumyng in Britane with sa great pissance,
and reddy to support him i^ all dangeris. And thairfore answerit to their
oratouris yt he money eris gone, had foret all offense (gyf any was maid to his
fader) and reiosit nocht little of the present felicite falling to his enie
Carance. And wald fulfill hes desyris (sa far as he micht) at al pointis aganis
ye Britonis* gif he micht have peace of pichtis. And yocht he mycht have nane,
he should send in his support ane cumpany of chosyn me^. Bot hes sel^ behuuit to
abide at hame for defense of his realm aganis the said pichtis. Carance glaid
of this answer stuffit al ye strenthis of Westmureland, and come with ane
cumpany of weill accuterit men to yt wa^tir of Esa, nocht far fra the wall of
Adriane, quhare he met Craithlint, and fell on kneis at his first metyng*
declaring him be money euydent reasonis innocent of Fyndokis slauchchter, and
desyrit the king to have him in na suspitioun, for yocht he was bannist be inuy
and hatrent amang uncouth pepell, it he behauit him self in sic manner, that he
was returnit in Albion both to the honor of him self and his freindis.
Craithlynt embrassit his enie Carance may tenderly and prayit him to stand
good freinde, as he should do to him, and to leif na thing of his purpose, sen
great honor and proffet (gif fortoun war propiciant) mycht succeed be the
samyn. And promittit gif the Pichtis weris war nocht impediment to him, he ^uld
nocht faill to support him with his vter pissance. Carance reiosyng of the
kyngis beniuolence said, he had sufficient army to expel the romany out of
Brytane, And to transfer ye crown their of in the lynnage of scottis, Gif
scottis and pichtis wald assist to him. Finaly be prudent industry of Carance
both their two kings war brocht togidder accumpanyit with ane few nowmer on
ylk syd. And to bring thaym to the mair sycker concord, Carance began to
remembir thaym, how the auld affinite betuix thaym was co^modius. Be contrar
the violatioun thairof full of damage to thaym both. And reme^berit thaym of
their frequent cheuelryis sa lang continewing aganis the fury of Romany and
Britonis in defense of their realmis and lyberteis, with sic amite and kyndnes,
that iniuris done to any ane of thaym war repute equale to yame both. For their
reasonis it was necessar to thaym other to haif peace with other for their
commoun weill or ellis to perseueir in battall to the destruction of thaym
both. Be their and siclike wourdis the two kyngis war persuadit to haif peace,
And to repair iniuris on athir side. sone after.viii. newtral personis of great
prudence war chosyn with both their consentis, be quhome the peace was finaly
roborat, and al iniuris plesandly redressit.

How Carance be support of Scottis and Pichtis slew Bassiane capitane of
Britane. And tuke the crown thairof and of his deith. And how the crown of
Britane was restorit to Romany. Ca. viii.
NOcht lang eft Qui^tus Bassianus capitane of britane rasit his camp to invade
ye said Carance, for he was cummyn to ork with three great buschementis of
Scottis Pichtis and otheris his freindis, and gottin the samyn randerit to him
but any offense of the inhabitantis, Bassianus (nochtwithstandyng ye frequent
rebellion maid aganis the Romany in all partis) it to revenge the attemptatis
done be Carance, rasit his army and par^it the samyn within ye nycht betuix two
mossis on ane strait ground. Carance nocht.x. mylis fra him and weil aduertist
of his doyngis, come forthwart in the samyn manner to gif him battall. On the
morrow Bassianus arrayit his folkis, and exhortit thaym to remembir how they
war to fecht for defense of equite aganis certane falls conspiratouris,
Specially aganis ye treasonabil murdresar Cara^ce, may odius creator to god
for his detestabil offense. And forthir prayit thaym to have respect to ye
Roman virtew, quhilk hes ben ay of sa great estimatioun both before immortal
goddis and men, that they mycht have be reward of victory, nocht only infinite
riches, bot perpetual loving be their posterite. On this other side cara^ce
was na les dilligent, exhorti^g hes army to battal, sayng yair ennymes had great
disauantage to fecht with thaym, because ye may part of yame were Britonis,
haua^d na les hatrent aganis Romany than he hes, and wald leif yame quhen they
saw any dangeir occurryng. And thairfore victory was present in their handis
gyf they with manheid and prudence ferslie ruschit on yair ennymes. Als sone as
both the armyis be blast of trumpat Iunit, The Britonis left ye Romany and
went (as they had been fleand) in good array to the nixt hill. The Romany seeing
their sydis nakit be fleyng of Britonis were astonist* and more myndfull of yair
sing^lar weill than any glore of victory. Finalie they were sa deieckit of their
curage, that they were put to flicht. On quhom followit Carance with all his
army in may hatrent. And slew yame ay (quhare they were (...)) bu^ any
miseratioun. Carance ^^and sa huge slauchter maid be the chase* callit his
folkis be ^ound of ^^umpat to the standart. In yis battall ^er slane Quintus
Bassianus capitane of Britane, and Hircius procuratour with money other nobillis
and commonis of their blude. The residew of Britonis (quhilkis were escuapit fra
this battall) were randerit to Carance, and gaif pledgis of the noblest that were
in yair realm* nocht within.xx. eris nor above.lx. eris to be his true
subdittis in times cumyng. Als sone as the pray of guddis falling be chance of
battall was deuidit amang the victorius pepill, Carance past to London quhair
he was ressauit with great reverence, and tuke ye sceptour and Diadem of
Britane contrar the empire of Romany. Eftir yat it was maid tributar to
Julius.iii.C.xlvi. eris. Carance crownit in yis manner held ii.M. Scottis and
Pychtis continewally about him in manner of ane guard. The remanent Scottis and
Pychtis returnit hame richit with the spule of this last battall. Than Carance
in more princely reward of their laubouris gaif all the landis lyand betuix the
wall of Adriane and orke namyt Westmureland and Cumber to their perpetual
dominioun. And throw this liberalite he come in great hatrent both to Romany
and Britonis. And howbeit he was oftymes assaileit be thaym with scharp
battallis. it he was victorius at all Iornays. And brukit ye crown of Britane
be crafty prudence, quhil at last he was slane the.vii. eir of his regne be
Alectus Roman capitane. This Alectus eftir the slaucht of Carance set his
extreme besynes to bring the Britonis agane to Roman lawis. And quhe^ he saw
they mycht na wayis be brocht thairto, for the cruel hatrent they had aganis
Romany, he maid laubouris to have their beniuolence, and finalie applaudit to
yair opinioun, and tuk the Crown of Britane contrar the auctorite of Romany.
And it he rang with na better fortoun, than did Carance. For he was slane in
the samyn manner be Asclepiadotus the third eir of his regne. Eftir quhais deith
ye crown of Britane was restorit (as it was before) to the Romany.

Of great cruelte done be Dioclesian emprioure aganis cristin pepyll. How Coell
vincust the Romany and conquest the crown of Britonis. How he was alliat
with Constantius empriour, and of the natiuite of great Constantyne. Ca. ix.
DIoclesiane emprioure at yis time be vassalage of Constantius, Maximianus, and
Galerius dantit the world with sindry chances of battall. And was the first
Roman emprioure yt was adorit with kingly reverence. For before they dayis the
emprioure vsit nocht bot salutationis. This emprioure causit rich perle and
precious stanis to be set in his schone in mair taikin of insole^ce than any
ornament. Before yat time was na difference betuix empriouris and vthir pepil
except the Rob ryal. This Dioclesiane was sa odious and bludy tyrane,
that.xvii.M. men and women were martyrit be him for defense of cristyn faith.
This cruelte nocht only enragit in the eist and west partis of the world, bot
als in Britane. And above their cruelteis Infinite nowmer of yame were condampnyt
to the Galionis. Wynnyng of querrellis and mynis. Be him also were brynt
innoumerable bukis of Cristin faith contenand the euangellis of Crist with ye
actis and epistillis of his appostollis, traistyng thairthrow that the faith of
Crist should all vterlie expire. Throw quhilk ye cristin faith ouirthrawin with new
scurgis and perseuerand cruelte was neir perist. Money haly and relligious men
for feir of their cruelteis fled in desertis and elraige placis. Quhair they were
exonerit of all truble and leiffit ane haly life. This dispitfull tyrane
Dioclesiane eftir sindry his triumphis maid in Rome for victoryis of diverse
pepill of the world, was trublit be punition of god with money uncouth
infirmiteis. And for slauchter of sa money innocent pepill he become furious at
Salonas, and slew him self be drynk of vennome the.xx. eir of his regne. To be
exampill that na man put confidence of felicite and eternal live in vane
favor and assentatioun of pepil. Quhil sic thingis were done be Dioclesian,
Coel discendyng of the anciant and nobill blude of Britonis was solistit be
thaym to rebel aganis the Romany. Asclepiadotus aduertist heirof met him with
ye army of Romany, and other that stude at his opinioun Followit ane aufull
and dangerus battall lang fochtin with doutsum victory. Bot at last ye Romany
were discomfist, and Asclepiadotus thayr capitane slane. Coel eftir this victory
was maid king. And to stabill ye realm to him in sicker peace, he co^mandit be
general edict all Romany and otheris of their opinioun to be slane quhare
ever they mycht be apprehendit. Constantius emprioure to meit this rebellioun
come in Britane with money Roman legionis. Aganis quhome went king Coel with
ane army of Britonis to defend his realm and liberte. Nochtheles he was
vincust and his army put to flycht. On the morrow Constantius was informyt be
the Britonis, that king Coel was native prince of Britane. And discendyng be
lang progressioun of the blude ryall thairof. And thairfore be co^miseratioun,
he send ane herald to him schawyng gyf he wald be randerit (as other briton
kingis were before) to romany he should be sufferit to remane in hes auctorite.
King Coel was this time trubillit with great infirmite cumyn be surfeit cauld and
walking in his weris aganis the Romany. Constantius heirand of his infirmite
past to make him consolatioun. Eftir may tender embrasyng, the said
constantius continewit king Coell in his auctorite. And tuke his douchter
Helene ane virgyne of may excellent bewte in marriage. This affinite maid
Romany and Britonis to believe ane final end to al their weris. Sic thyngis
done, Co^stantius went to vesy the Roman strenthis in britane. And nocht only
reparit yame (quhare they were ruinus) bot stuffi^ thaym with new prouisioun of
men and vittallis. Syne commandit the cietezanis of every town (quhare he come)
to be obeysant to king Coell during hes life, because he was freint^ of the
Senate and pepill of Rome* Schort time eftir Constantius had ane son gottin be
this new affinit^ namyt Constantyne. Quhilk for (...) singular manheid and
prudence succedie eftir his faderis deith to the (...) Imperial. And was the
(...) priour that gaif peace to the Catholic kirk. And dotat it with money
rich templis, landis, and iowellis be hortatioun of ye haly paip Siluester.
But we will return to the mat^iall dedis yat Constantius did before this time
in Britane. Constantius eftir ye deith of Dioclesiane h^uand Britane, France,
and Spane peacifyit to his empire, gaderi^ ane army to expel the Scottis and
Pychtis out of Westmureland and Cumber, quhilkis were geuyn to thaym before be
king Carance. Eftir his cummyng to ork he was aduertist yat Scottis and Pychtis
were strongly gaderit to resist him. And because he knew they micht not abyd
la^g togi^der, he thocht best to brek thaym be lang tarry. And to the samyn
effect he abaid still with sindry Romany at ork. And co^mandit ye Britonis to
pas hame and be reddy to return quhen they were chargit. finalie quhen he had
remauit certane dayis in ork. geuand his extreme deligence to brek the Pichtis
fra the Scottis, he tuke sic mala^coly (because he mycht nocht bring his purpos
to good fine). That he fell in ane hait fever And ye.vii. day eft deceissit.
Quhais powder was gaderit in ane goldin veschell with money smelland odouris,
and brocht with funeral triumph to Rome. Yis Co^stantius (as we have schawin)
was rycht thankful to cristin pepil. Nochyeles sindry britonis traistyng him
to persew the faith of Crist wc sic cruelie (as Dioclesiane did before) come in
Scotland Quhare they were plesandly ressauit be Craithlynt And ordanit to maik
yair residence in ye I Will of Man with kirkis ereckit to thaym in Catholic manner
for deuyne service. Yus were the auld rytis and cerymonis of Gentilis (quhilkes
indurit to they dayis) abrogat. The first bischop that was amang thaym in this
I Will was ane Britone namit Amphibolus, quhilk prechit the euangellis throw all
the boundis of Scottis and Pychtis. And nocht only remouit al vane
superstitionis, bot laid the sickir foundement of ye cristin faith. Craithlynt
king of Scottis dotat this kirk be his singular deuotioun with money Iowellis
and precious ornamentis of gold and silver, and maid ane alter of copper
craftily closit with lokkis in quhilk were gaderit ye rentis and malis of sindry
la^dis, quhilkis were geuyn be the king for sustentatioun of divine service.
This was ye first kirk that was dedicat amang ws in Catholic manner, and first
sait of bischoppis callit Sodoren. Howbeit ye reason thairof be tynt be roust
of eris, quhilk distroyis every thing. Craithlynt passing his time in this
manner with religious and civil materes was ane nobill prince and finalie
deceissit the.xxiiii. eir of his regne. Ye first eir of the empire of great
Constantyne empriour. Fra the incarnatioun.iii.C.xxii. eris. Fra the beginning
of ye world.v.M.iiii.C.lxxxx. eris. Fra ye begi^nyng of ye realm of
Scottis.vi.C.lv. eris.

How Fyncormak was maid king of Scottis. and Octauius king of Britonis. How
Herculeus Roman capitane was slane be Octauius and the Romany vincust. How
ye scottis and pichtis come in support of Octauius* and chasit Thraherus in
France. Ca. x.
CRaithlynt deceissy^on this wise, succedit his cosyng Fyncormak. For they were
brethir sonnys. This Fyncormake was crownit in the first ere of great
Constantyne. In quhais time raise great trubil in Albion. For ye co^monis of
Britane hauand extreme hatrent aganis the tyranny of Cayus Herculeus capitane
of Britane, chesit Octauius prince of Walis to be thayr king. Cayus Herculeus
to dant yis rebellion rasit his camp aganis Octauius. Bot at last he was slane
and his army discomfist. Octauius traistyng na thing sa good (as to use his
victory with may rigor) come to London. And eftir that he had gottyn all
the strenthis thairof randerit to him, he slew sindry nobill men of Britane for
their assistance to romany. Syne persewit the Romanys to the deith quhair euir
they mycht be apprehendit, Constantyne empriour to punis this rebellion send
ane vaileant capitane namyt Traherus with money legionis in Britane. Be quhom
Octauius was put to flycht and ch^sit amang the Scottis. Traherus insolent
eftir this victory, chargit Fyncormak to send Octauius ye inuasour of Roman
province bound to him to be punist for his rebellion. Uthirwayis he should be
repute ennyme to ye Senate and pepil of Rome. It was answerit be Fyncormak, yat
he resset nocht Octauius to be injurious to Romany. Bot allanerlye for the
auld amyte betuix Scottis and Britonis. Attoure it mycht obscure his honor and
majesty to condescend to sa manifest prodition, and randir the man to his
ennymes yat socht refuge at him. Forthir gyf Traherus inuadit him only for ye
cause, he should resist the best way he mycht. Bot it good were before he mouit
weir, to degeistely avise. Quhiddir Romany hes gottyn mair schame or honor,
mair proffet or skaith in their weris aganis Scottis in all times bygane.
Traherus na thing satifyit be this answer, come with all his ordinance to ork.
Quhair he was aduertist that Fyncormak was gaderit with.lx.M. Scottis Pichtis
and Britonis in support of Octauius. Nochtheles he went forwart quhill he come
in sycht of ennymes. Fyncormak (quhen both ye armyis were arrayit in otheres
sicht) send ane herald inquiryng Traherus, quhat mouit him but occasioun of
iniuris to inuaid the co^fiderat pepil as they were ennymes to Romany. Traherus
maid litill answer thairto bot co^mandit the Scottis and Pychtis to pas
haistely out of all landis pertenand to Romany, and to pay ane eirly tribute
to yair procuratour as ye Senate and pepill of Rome thocht expedient. And but
any more tarry de liver Octauius to be punyst for his conspiration. Othirwayis
they should have sone experience, quhat folly is to contempne the empire of
Romany. Fyncormak hauand their charges at dyffyance, come forthwart with his
army. Followit sone ane dangerus battall. Alwayis the Romany had been
victorius, were nocht ane multitude of landwart men hapnyt to come rynnand down
ane hyl, driuand away yair bestial fra dangeir of ennymes. And apperit to the
Romany as they were cumyn on their bakkis. And so the Romany were finalie
discomfist. In this battal were slane.xv.M. Albianis, and.xvi.M. Romany. The
chase continewit be Fyncormak and Octauius on the Romany quhill they come to
ork Quhair ye two kyngis were plesandly ressauit be ye nobillis of Britane And
Octauius restorit to the crown thairof. The nobillis of Britane (...) to
Fincormak for his assistance (...) Octauius in the said field all the ^^ndis of
Westmureland and Cumbe^ with clame and kindness thairof perpetually, and sweir
neuir to cum in ye contrar thairof. Traherus knawyng na place sicker to remane
i^ Britane eftir this victory, fled i^ France.

How Octauius was put fra the crown of Britane be Traherus roman capitane.
How the said Traherus was slane and Octauius restorit to the croun^ and of
Fyncormakis deith. Ca. xi.
THe romans vincust on yis wise, ane cou^sal was set at ork in the quhilk ye
nobillis of Britane co^cludit to defend yair realm and liberty fra iniure of
Romany, and to suffi^ na uncouth blude to beir auctorite in times cumyng above
thaym. Attoure it was concludit to extend the marchis of Britane to the wall of
Adriane. And to expel the scottis out of Westmureland and Cumber nocht
withstandyng the aith and promise maid to thaim afort. Quhil sic things were
done in Britane, Octauius come with.x.M. Britonis on the Scottis and Pichtis
dwelling in Westmurland. Bot at last he was discomfist. And his army put to
flycht. In the mean time Traherus capitane of Britane, Quhilk was chasit (as we
schew before) in france, returnit with two Roman legionis and.xx.M. wageouris
in Britane. Be quhome Octauius was discomfist, and destitute of all support and
freindis. Finalie this Octauius hauand na confidence in the Scottis nor Pychtis
for violatioun of his faith, come to the mouth of Number* Quhair he pullit up
salis, and went in Norroway. Traherus eftir yis victory ilk day incressit in
sic pissance, that the Britonis were randerit to him. Nottheles he exercit great
crueltes on all the nobillis and co^monis of Britan And finalie restorit the
crown their of to Roman empire. And quhen he had stablit the realm in this
manner throw corruppit insolence eft sa hie felicite, he become the may
vicious tyrane, y^ euir had any charge before i^ Britane. And inuadit ye
nobillis and co^monis thairof with Ithand heirschippis and slauchter. Throw
their tyrannys followit sic rebellioun aganis him in all partis, that he was
finalie slane. Octauius heirand the slauchter of Traherus, returnyt fra Denmark
in Britane. and persewit the Romany with sic cruelte, yat na kirkis nor
sanctuariis mycht be refuge to thaym. And maid distributioun of his officis and
auctoriteis to his freindis and nobillis, as he thocht may expedient to keip
his subdities in Justice and to defend thaym fra iniure of romany. And youcht
seyn dyl ar found me^ but insolence, quhe^ they find felicite after trubyll. it
Octauius was alterit in sic manner. that quhare he was sumtyme may falls and
treasonabyll in his werkis, he become may faithful and nobyll prince. And
sone after he send ambassatouris to king Fyncormak with sindry iowelles
desiring him to have na respect to ye offense maid be him aganis the Scottis
and Pychtis in times bygane. bot to leif in amyte and freindschip with him and
Britonis in times cumyng. And to haif his sicker kyndnes, he was content that
Westmureland and Cumber war perpetually annixit to the empire of Scottis and
Pychtis on the samyn manner, as Carance gave thaym before to king Craithlint.
Money eris after Octauius gouernit Britane in good Justice, Quhill at last he was
sa brokin with frequent weris, that he randerit all the strenthis of his realm
to have peace with Romany in his eld, and was content to pay the auld tribute.
Followit sicker peace money eris after amang the Scottis Pychtis and Brytonis in
Albioun. In quhilk time Fyncormak richt illuster in glore of cheuelry and
civil materis be lang infirmyte generit of catare, deceissit the xlvii. eir of
his regne. Fra the incarnatioun.iii.C.lviii. eris.

How the heresyis of Arrius was condampnit. How Ireland tuke the faith of
Crist. How Romak Fethelmak and Angusiane contendit for the crown. How Romak
was maid king and slane after for his tyranny. Ca. xii.
DUring this time, the cristin faith apperit to rise in great dignite.
Nochtheles the cursit heretik Arrius began to poison it with vennymus doctrine.
Saying Crist was nocht the verray son of god, coequall and coeternall to the
fader bot different fra him in substance. After degeist consultatioun all his
opinionis war condampnit in counsall of Nicia with money other vane errouris,
quhilkis I will not rehers at this time. For I have maid these tra^slatio^ mair
for pleseir of lawir me^ tha^ any vane curious clerks, be quhom all heresyis
begynnis. Ireland about this time tuke ye faith of Crist be ane woman of ye
Pychtis blude, Quhylk instruckit the queen of Ireland in the faith. And scho
instruckit her prince the king. And sa within schort time all the regioun
thairof tuke the faith. Money other pepyll in ye Eist and West partis of the
world tuke the faith in the samyn manner. Bot we will return to our hystory.
Fyncormak left behynd him two sonnis, Eugenius of.xviii. eris of age, and
Ethodius nocht ane eir of age. Their sonnis of Fyncormak for ye lawis before
rehersit micht nocht immediately succeed to the crown, and thairfore ane
counsall was set in Argyle to these the king. Quhilk day comperit Romak
Fethelmak and Angusiane co^tending for the crown, for they war nepottis to
Craithlint gottyn on sindry his brethir all three nere equal in eris, freindis,
and gudis. Romak clamit the crown as may nobyl* for he was not only cumyn of
ye blude ryal of scottis, bot als of pichtis, and had thairfore money of the
nobillis assistyng to his opinion. Augusiane clamyt the crown with consent of
Fethelmak, and alledgit he was ane man of more reason, experience and wisdom,
tha^ was Romak. And was abillar thairfore for ye ministration of the realm. In
the mean time Romak gaderit ane band of armit men to sla his two cousyngis,
traisting ye more esalie to succeid to the crown. Thus raise na thing bot Ire
and hatrene amang the three cosingis every ane of thaym cruelly set in otheris
slauchter. And lauboryng to draw moniast of the nobillis to their opinioun.
Alwayis the may nowmer of nobillis assentit to Augusiane. For Romak was ane
man of mair ferocite than wisdom. Be co^trar An^u^iane was more reasonable,
ha^^nd nocht sa money subtel and falls (...) as Romak had. The nobillis seeing
thaym abil na wayis to be b^o^ht to concord, tuke final purpois to divide the
realm betuix thaym. it otheris more prudent men thocht the samyn
unprofitable. For it mycht raise perpetual seditioun in damage of their
commoun weill. Finalie Romak impacie^t of lang tarry be birnand desire to have
the crown gaderit ane army of Pychtis. And come with arrayit battall aganis
Augusiane and his other cosyng Fethelmak. Than Augusiane send his oratouris to
the king of Pychtis praying him to foster na seditioun amang the Scottis and
Pychtis, and to solist his cosing Romak erat to concord than battall. Sen he
mycht have all thing according to reason but any plee. The king of Pichtis
thynkand their desyris reasonabil tuk purpos to return hame. Nochttheles be
evil counsall of freindis, he abaid and gaif vnplesand answer. This vnplesand
answer was nocht only occasioun to ye nobillis of scotland to assist to
Augusiane aganis Romak, bot als to have the Pichtis at extreme hatrent. Sone
eftir Angusiane aduertist that Romak lay in wait of his slauchter, gaderit ane
army with purpos erat to end the matter be swerd than ay to leif in da^geir of
his life. Romak impacient of lang tarry met him on the same manner. Followit ane
sorrowful battall. Nochtheles Augusiane was discomfist and both him self and
his cosing Fethelmak chasit in ye Ilis. And findyng na securite their they fled
in Ireland. Augusiane doung out of Albioun in this sort, money of the nobillis
assistit to Romak. And declarit him king. it (as ye custom of tyrannys is) he
conquest ye realm wekitlie and gouernit it on the same manner. And had nane
familiar with him, bot sa money as were ennymes to Fyncormak and his sonnis. Sic
thyngis done he maid him to vesy all boundis of his realm. Doing Justice in
his manner. This tyranny of Romak beand diuulgat throw ye cuntre, causit
Eugenius and Ethodius the sonnis of Fyncormak to fle in Westmurela^d. And their
finding na securite, they fled to the I Will of Man. Than followit great truble in
Scotland. As proscriptioun, slauchter and oppressioun on all the nobillis that
fauorit Augusiane but any difference of age. The nobillis impacient to suffer
sic cruel tyrannyis co^uenit togidder be secret writingis to redres al
oppressionis and wrangis done be him. Syne gaderit ane army with sic diligence,
that this tyrane Romak knew nocht of their assemblance, quhill they were cumyng
on him in ane arrayit battall within.x. mylis. Romak astonist be their cummyng
fled in Pentland. Nochttheles he was sa ferslye inuadit be ane buschement of
Scottis that followit on him, that he was slane with syndry otheris Scottis of
his opinion ye third eir of his regne, his heid borne on ane staik throw all the
army. Money gentle men of Pychtis war slane at this time with Romak, sic as
fauorit his governance. and causit him to rage with great cruelte on the Scottis.

How Augusiane was maid king of Scottis. How Maximus subdevvit the Britonis
be syndry victoryis. How Scottis and Pichtis inuadit other with set battall.
How both their kyngis war slane and the Scottis discomfist. Ca. xiii.
ROmak the tyrane slane in this manner, Augusiane returnit in Albion, and was
maid king. Quhyll sic things war done in Scotland, the Brytonis grew insolent
be slauchter of Traherus Roman capitane, and restorit the crown of Brytane to
Octauius, quhylk was than far run in aige. Throw quhylk they recouerit both
thayr munitionis, landis, and lyberteis. Constantius emprioure and son to the
great Constantyne, send ane vayleant knycht namyt Maximus in Brytane to dant the
Brytonis. This Maximus sone after his cumyng faucht aganis the Brytonis, and
put thaym to flycht. Be this vyctory he was put in esperance to subdew the
Brytonis (as they war before) to seruytude. Octauius king of Brytonis heirand
their tythyngis tuke sic malancoly that he deceissit the third day after. And
after his deith Octauius his son fled in ye I Will of Man. Quhare he remanit
with Ethodius and Eugenius* unknown quhat he was. The Brytonis nocht mekyll
astonist be this discomfitoure, gaderit ane new army with mair pissance than
before, nochttheles they war vincust and chasit on ye same manner. Maximus after
their victorijs past throw syndry bou^dis of Britane, and gat money of the pepyll
randerit to his opinioun. Otheris (quhilkis war repugnant) war put to wraik,
and their str^this cassyn down. Quhyll sic thyngis was done in Britane, raise
great trubyl in scotland. For Nectanus king of Pichtis to revenge the slauchter
of his cosyng Romak wastit the landis of Scotland be syndry incursionis. The
Scottis to resist this violent deceptionis war constranit to rise in battall
aganis the Pychtis. Nochtheles the Pychtis drew ane great nowmer of Scottis
(quhilkis war mouit for slauchter of Romak) to their opinioun, and prouokit the
residew of scottis ylk day to battal. Nochtheles Augusiane send his
ambassatoures to thaym, schawyng him desyrus of peace, and geuyn to the weill
of both the realms. And desyrie thaym to deuoid all iniutis, and concur
togidder in amyte (as their faderis did before) for defense of their realmis. At
last quhen Augusiane saw his desyris repellit (yt his sleuth should nocht be
occasioun of insolence to his ennymes) he gaderit his folks and went furthwart
in good array. After money syngulare battallis of vaileant me^, both ye armyis
iunit, and saucht with great Ire and hatrent on athir side. At last the Pichtis
war discomfist, and money of all their nobillis slane. King Nectanus was chasyt.
quhyll he come to Camelon, And sone after his cummyng thairto, he conuenit the
resydew of his nobillis to ane counsall, and complanit be lang orison both the
slauchter of his cusyng Romak, and ye noblis of his realm that war slane with
him, and desirit ane new army to revenge the schameful iniuris done la^tly be
scottis. The Pichtis mair set for the kyngis folly and plesour, tha^ for their
common weill, concludit ane new army to be rasit aganis the scottis out of all
boundis under their empire. And sone after they come with the said army to the
wod of Calydon. Augusiane richt provident in (...) his doyngis, and knawyng the
pich^is sa awfully gaderit aganis him* assemblit his folkis out of all boundis
of his realm erar to draw the Pichtis to concord, than to have battall with
thaym, for he dred the Brytonis be persuasion of romany to cu^ in support of
pichtis. And for ye cause he send his plesand letteres to ye king of Pychtis,
praying him to remember the anciant amyte and kyndnes sa lang contynewing
betuix the two pepyll. And to put end to their weris, and to geif peace to
Scottis but any battal on that samyn manner as he war victorius above thaym, sen
peace was necessar to both their armyis. For Maximus Roman capitane was
wirkand ylk day new attemptatis in britane, and purposit (als sone as he hes
subdewit Britane) to conques both ye realms of scottis and pichtis, after yt
they have distroyit other with civil weris. The king of Pichtis co^tempning
this profitab^l counsal, and hauand na thing in les estimatioun than peace,
rasit his army aganis Augusiane. On ye tothir side Augusiane arrayit his army,
and because it was necessar other to ieoparde him to ye chance of fortoun, or
ellis to geif backis to his ennymes with irrecouerable schame, he exhortit his
me^ to have curage, and set asyd al dredour (gif they had any) remembering the
great spreit and manheid of their eldaris, that they may acquit their deith,
and yocht they faucht with unfortunate chance of battal, yt they de nocht
vnreuengit of their ennymes. Attoure he prayit thaym to be nocht mouit (youcht
they be now to fecht aganis the pepyll that was sa lang co^fiderat with thaym
in amite and blude), sen they gave na occasioun of battal. And hes left na
thing undone, that mycht have recounsalit thaym to concord. for quhilk they
should believe, y^ god the luffer of peace should favor thaym in their just
defense. On the tothir side the king of Pichtis ceissit nocht to solist his
army to battal. Incontinent ye archearis schot on all fydis, and after thaym
followit men with licht harnes, and schot incredibill nowmer of stanis and
ganeis with corsbowes and slongis. Incontinent they iunit with speris axis and
swerdis. Followit ane terribyll battall fouchtyn lang time with doutsum
victory. At last Angusiane seand the victory inclyne to Pychtis, raif of his
coit armoure, and come amang the commonis, quhare he faucht with perseuerant
hatrent to the deith. The Scottis traisting their king erat fled than slane,
gaif bakkis. Otheris perseuerant with mair obstinat mind faucht quhill they war
slane, and yocht the vyctory succedit to the Pychtis. it it was vnplesand to
thaym, for both the kyngis war slane in this field with infinite nowmer of
nobillis and commonis slane on ylk side. The residew of Scottis and Pichtis
(quhilkes war eschapit out of this field) returnit hame, and wari^t thaym that
was the first occasioun and motyue of battall betuix the two pepyll sa lang
before confiderit togidder in blude, amite, and freindschip.

How Fethelmak was maid king of Scottis. and how he slew Nectane king of
Pichtis* and was slane after be their treason, and of money nobil clerkis. Ca.
xiiii.
AUgusiane slane in this manner, Fethelmak the third nepot of Craithlynt was
maid king, he gaderit ye residew of Scottis togydder with little better
fortoun, than his two cosyngis did before. And in the secund eir of his regne,
he rasit his army to revenge ye iniuris done be Pichtis, and come in Augus
inuadyng ye inhabitantis thairof with great heirschippes and cruelteis. The
Pychtis rageand in hatrent for their extorsionis ruschit i^ their may fury to
harnes. And ye scottis nocht abasit yairof, met thaym in ye samyn manner, and
put both their wyngis to flicht. Sone after discomfist ye middillward in the
samyn manner with great murdir maid on thaym i^ al partis. Nectanus king of
Pichtis brothir to king Nectanus before rehersit, was brocht out of the field.
And deceissit ye third day after, be wound ane of arrow. The Scottis insolent
after this victory wais^it Angus and Fiffe with Ithand incursionis. The Pichtis
brokyn be this last discomfitoure, set thaym erar to stop ye scottis fra taking
of their munitionis and strenthis be licht berganis, tha^ any set battal. And
to do al thingis with mair prudence, they chesit Hergestus (ane man of sle and
falls ingyne) to be their king. This Hergestus knawyng his pepyll sa brokyn with
continewal weris that he mycht nocht revenge the iniuris of Scottis, kest him
to do the thing be slycht, that he mycht nocht do be force. And conducit two
men of Pichtis to dissimi^ and fene thaym Scottis, that they mycht mair esaly
wait ane ganand time to sla the king of Scottis. Their Pichtis war crafty in
castyng of dartis, and because ye king of Scottis tuke delectatioun in ye game,
yall war maid the mair familiar to him. Nochyeles they socht ay ane gana^d time
and place for his slauchter. King Fethelmak hapnit to pas to Carrik, quhare he
was in great solicitude all that day. At even he went to his bed, and co^mandit
ane harpar to sing ane soft sang to draw him out of heavy materes on sleip. Als
sone as he was fallyn on sleip, the two Pychtis before rehersit was conuoyit be
the harpar quhare he lay, and slew him sleipand in his bed ye third eir of his
regne. The wache herand the granis of ane deand man enterit haistely in the
chalmer quhare ye king was lyand bullerand in his blude. Incontinent they
followit on his slayaris sa scharply, yat they war all taken. And quhen they had
confessit all ye manner and circumstance of this treasonabyll slauchter, they
war all punist may cruelly to the deith, and drawin syndry with wyld horse.
This slauchter of Fethelmak hapnit in the fyft eir of Constantius emprioure.
About this time wa^ money clerkis profound in every science. As Uictoryne
oratoure, Donatus gramariour, and preceptour to sanct Jerome. Alcinus and
Delphidinis philosophouris with money otheris quhilkis war ouir prolixie to
rehers.

How sanct Reule brocht sanct Androvvis arm in Scotland* and how the kirk of
sanct Androvvis was do^at be Hergest king of Pichtis* and of the loving
thairof. Ca. xv.
SAnct Reule the haly abbot arriuit about this time in Albion with sa^ct
Androwis arm. This Reule was ane monk of (...) borne in Achaya* and abbot ^n
the town of Patras, quhare money religious men war obeysant under his cure. He
was ane of thaym yt was send be Constantius empriour to ^esy the blissit
reliquies of sanct Andro. And quhen the said Reule had done his deuotioun with
may reverence, he was co^mandit be ane heuynly visioun to take the arm of
sanct Andro with.iii. fyngaris and iii. tayis of his fut. And to pas with the
samyn in ye far nuke of ye world namit Albion. Reule monist be this visioun
come with the said reliquies throw the seis mediterrane to Portingale, and with
huge pyne and trubyl he come throw ye spane, franche, and almane seis. And
arriuit in the town quhilk is now callit sanct Androwis, quhare they war schip
brokin, and na thing sauit except ane few nowmer of haly men, quhylkis come
with the said reliquies. Their tithingis diuulgat in the cuntre causit the king
of Pichtis and his pepyll to cum with rich offerandis out of all partis to
adore the reliquies of ye haly appostyll sanct Andro. The king of Pichtis with
his pepil war ressault be sanct Reule and his fallowis i^ their religious
habitis with sangis and ympnis and other divine cerimonyis as afferit. Than
Hergestus fell on kneis, and with may reverence kissed their blissit reliquies,
and gaif his palice ryall richely biggit after ye use of they dayis to sanct
Andro, sanct Reule, and otheris his fallowis, and biggit ane kirk nocht far fra
ye said palice dedicat in the honor of sanct Andro. Men sayis it is ye samin
kirk ye standis it in the common kirk ard of the abbay, and was callit in auld
times the kirk of sanct Reule, bot it is now callit the auld kirk of sanct
Andro. Hergest dotat these kirk with cowpis, challicis, basingis, lawaris, and
syndry other rich Iowellis of gold and silver to remane their perpetually in
ye honor of deuyne service. The posterite of king Hergestus succeding after
him. and the scottis (quhen the pichtis was exilit of this realm) h^s had
sanct Andro in may reverence, as patroun of their realm. The abbay kirk was
dotat after be king Malcolne ye madyn, and king Robert Brus with rentis,
landis, and possessionis mair largely. This abbay was in governance of ane
nobil man Iohne Hebburne priour thairof in ye time of ye first compiling of
their cronikles. This priour was ane wise prelat and decorit these kirk in with
with money rich orname^tis, he biggit ane wall of square stanis about ye kirk.
This wall includis the kirk of sanct Leonard, quhare the nouicis of the said
abbay and vthir scolaris lernis their gra^mer, logik, theology, with money other
science of natural and moral Philosophy, and hes sic continewal exercitio^ yt
money resolute and profound clerkis risis daily in great virtew throw the samyn.
In this kirk war first preistes callit culdeyis. Bot now in it ar channonis
regular after the institutionis of sanct Augustyne, geuand their ingyne in
co^tinewall exercitioun of letteris and professioun of their religioun.
Heirfore gif thou will have respect to letteral exercition, thou sall find their
general study in every science. Gyf thou will be co^templatiue, thou sal find
their may honorabyll service of god with heuynly and delitious sang i^ may
crafty music. Gif thou will have sicht to magnificence and curious biggin, thou
sal find nane of mair honestee nor admiration in Italy, France, or Almany
biggit curiously be this nobyll man. Quhilk deceissit the eir before the cumyng
of their cronyklis to lycht, to na les damage of commoun weill, than spredyng
of letteris i^ this realm. ama^g money other his honorabyll werkis it is
gretumly to be louit, that before his deith he maid his nepot Patrik ane man of
syngular virtew and eruditioun his successoure, to compleit the magnificent
werkis that he before began. The eir that sanct Reule come with the reliquies of
sanct Andro in Scotland was fra ye Incarnatioun.iii.C.lxix.

Hov Eugenius was maid king of Scottis, How Hergest king of Pichtis was
confiderat with Romany for destruction of Scottis. How Maximus capitane of
Britane inuadit the Scottis with great cruelteis and slauchter. Ca. xvi
FEthelmak slane in manner before rehersit, the nobillis brocht Eugenius and
Ethodius ye sonnis of Fyncormak out of the I Will of Man, quhare they abaid
eschewin the fury of Romak, Augusiane, and Fethelmak. And the eldest of thaym
namit Eugenius ye first of ye name was maid king. Maximus capitane of britane
knawyng ye hatre^t betuix ye scottis and pichtis, na les desirus to distroy
thaym both, than to agment ye glore of Roman empire deuisit sic ane subtle
slicht, yt he mycht first distroy the scottis, and syne ye pichtis* and to wirk
this matter with mair crafty slichtis, he send ambassatouris to Hergest king of
Pichtis, schawyng him richt sorrowful for the iniuris done to him be Scottis.
And desyrit thairfor to be confiderat with the said king of Pychtis aganis the
Scottis. Quharethrow i^ mycht happyn that his pepyl mycht rise in sic pissance
be support of Romany and Britonis, that they mycht other thirll the Scottis to
may vile seruytude, or ellis expel thaym (gyf they plesit) out of Albyoun.
And conques their landis and rowmes to thaym and their posterite. King Hergest
plesa^dly ressauit their ambassatouris, and gave thankis to god, that send to
him support in sa extreme dangeir aganis his cruel ennymes. And said, it
plesit him weill to be confiderat with the Romany, sa they wald concur with
him and his pepyll to revenge the iniuris done be the Scottis. Maximus
condyscendit to their desyris, traisting the samyn to cum to hie felicite of
Roman empire. Nocht lang after it was concludit be conuention of Hergestus and
Maximus at ork, ye Pychtis Britonis and Romany salbe co^fiderat togidder in
tendir amit^. and the Scottis to be haldyn as ennymes to thaym all* After this
conuentioun Maximus send ane herald to Eugenius king of Scottis, chargeand him
to redres all skaithis done to Pichtis, and deliver the mysdoaris to king
Hergest to be punist at his plesour. Uthirwayis he and his pepyll should be reput
as ennymes to the senate and pepyll of Rome. Eugenius answerit, he neuir
offendit the Romany nor Britonis be iniuris, and thairfore he beleuit y^
Romany wald nocht be sa wrangus, as to inua^e him with battall but reasonabyll
motive or occasioun. Forthir he v^derstude the Romany has nocht gottin sic
humanite and kyndnes of Pichtis, to move any weir aganis the Scottis tha^
present, sen they neuir offendit to Romany. Alwayis he was content both to
geif and take redres with the Pychtis, and they (quhilkis inuadis vthir with
iniuris in times cumyng) to be punys^ as the crime requirit. Forthir gif y^
romany be advise of Pichtis wald invade him but any just occasion of battal,
he mycht do na thing les, tha^ commend his good actioun to god the punisar of
wrangis, and do the best he mycht for defense of his realm and liberte. For ye
Romany (as weill apperis) ar na les set for exterminioun of Pichtis* than of
Scottis. Maximus after this answer assembly ane large army of Romany,
Britonis, and Franchemen and enterit in Westmureland, ceissyng fra na manner of
cruelteis on ye inhabitantis thairof. And garnist all the strenthis of that
regioun with Roman sodiouris. And sone after he come in Anna^dale Galloway*
and syndry vthir bounds exercing great cruelteis on the same manner. The scottis
herand sa huge multitude of pepyll assemblit aganis thaym, war affrayit.
Nochyeles s^and na vthir remeid, they come out of all partis of Scotland be
command of Eugenius with na les ma^heid tha^ ardent desire to resyst yair
ennymes, and faucht with romany beside the watter of Cree, Quhare he was put
to flycht, and his army discomfist. Sa great slauchter was maid on the brayis of
this reuer, yat the same was fyllit full of deid bodyis. The Romany followit
sa fast on the chase of Scottis, quhyll at last they enterit in ane new bergane
with ye men of Argyle, for they war cumyn forthwart to support Eugenius army,
knawyng na thing of this discomfiture. And quhen they saw the romany follow
with sic cruelteis on the Scottis, they ruschit with terribyl vissage, noyis,
and rummysyng on the said Romany, and maid sic vndemus slaucht on thaym, that
the resydew of Scottis (quhilkis war laitly diffait) returnit to battall, and
chasit the Romany agane to their tents, inuadyng thaym with contynuall
slauchter quhyll ye nycht put end to their laubour. Thus was the chance of
battall variant ye first day betuix the Scottis and their ennymes. The Romany
nocht knawing the counsall of scottis (howbeit money of thaym war slane) stud in
houor, nocht knawyng quhidder they wald renew battal in ye samyn nicht, or
abide the day. it to have thaym reddy aganis all chance that mycht follow, they
stuffit their tentis with may crafty ordinance. Eugenius seeing on the morrow
his pepyll brokin with sic innoumerable slauchter rasi^ his tentis within ye
nycht, and come to Carrik, quhair he tuk lang consultatioun, how he mycht arm
him best aganis al chance of battal that mycht follow. Maximus on ye morrow
intendyng to persew the scottis with new battall, was aduertist of great
seditioun risyng in Britane Specially amang thaym yat dwelt within ye Roman
prouincis. Their nouellis causit him to desist fra his purpos, and return in
Kent. Eftir that he garnist all ye strenhis of Galloway with men, munitionis,
and vittallis. Their were the dedis of Maximus aganis Scotts in ye first eris.

How Maximus returnit in Gallovvay to revenge the iniuris done be Scottis
aganis Pichtis. How Eugenius come with.l.M. men to resist the Romany Pichtis
and Britonis. How he was slane, his brothir taken* and his army discomfist.
Ca. xvii.
MAximus in the eir followyng was sa Ithandlie occupyir with this trubill of
britonis before rehersit, yt he mycht nocht return to ye weris of Scottis.
Nochtheles money frequent incursionis continewit all the said time betuix his
wageouris, and the Scottis. At last quhen the scottis had assaileit la^g time
(Howbeit it was in vane) to recover ye strenthis of Galloway, they past throw
Menteith, Striuilyng and Fyffe, and sindry other boundis of Pychtis, Inuadyng
the same with sic cruelte, that they were left desert. Maximus apperit rycht
heavy at their offencis, howbeit na thing was more plesand to him than to heir
the Scotts and Pychtes inuadyng other to both their mischeiffis. Finalie he
come in Galloway with purpos to pas throw all the remanent boundis of Scottis.
Than was Eugenius nocht far fra the Romany abidyng the cummyng of his pepill,
to quhom comperit great co^fluence of sensabil men and women to the nowmer of
fifty thousand pepil rycht desirus to fecht, and criand atanis with huge noys
other to de, or ellis to have victory. For they were cruelly slane in all pertis
quhare they mycht be apprehe^dit be romany but any mercy or ranson, and
nochtwithsta^ding their great curage they were sumpart astonist, herand ye
Romany cummyng in their landis with more multitude and pissance of pepill,
than euir was seen in any of their boundis before. it otheris hauand the Roman
tyranny at dispite, were rasit in may fury, regardyng na thing their life in
defense of their liberte. Than Eugenius with great curage dissimulit his
contina^ce, as he were affrayit of na thing les, than of the Romany. And
deuidit his army in three battallis. The richt wyng was geuyn to his brodir
Ethodius. The left wyng to Doalus capitane of Argyle. And in the myddilward was
him self. Their battallis were arrayit in sic craft, that in ye place (quhair the
battall was set) he beleuit nocht only to have the river of Munda deip but any
furd on the bakkis of his army, that they should fecht but refuge. Bot als to
have ye son gangand to siclik on yair bakkis, that their ennymes micht nocht
hald up their eyn for reflixioun of contrar beymis in their sycht. Sic thyngis
done, Eugenius went to ane hie mote, and callit his army to the standart, and
said in yis manner. Our eldaris that began this realm with continewall laubour
and brocht the samyn with honor to our days (forcy campionis) commandit their
posterite to defend their realm and liberte (quhilk is may dulce and heuynly
treasoure in ye erd) aganis al inuasouris, hauand esperance of victory (quhen
time was to fecht aganis yair ennymes) in na thing more tha^ in yair handis,
and to be obeysant to the wise and nobill capitanis of this realm. Quhais
auctorite and prudence been sicker targe both to their guddis, landis, and
liffis aganis all preis and dangeir of ennymes. All our eldaris (that are passit
before ws) were ay obedient to the command of their nobillis, and yocht they have
touchtin oftymes with sindry chan^is of battall aganis the dantouris of the
world, it they were finalie victouris. Now mon we fecht (may vaileant
campionis) with sic manheid and curage (as our eldaris faucht before ws). Or
else mon we tyne our realm and liberte, And be thirlly^ to may vile
servitude at the will of our ennymes. Now approchis Maximus our cruel and
unmercifully ennymy, to reif both our landis and guddis, gyf we support nocht
our self be grace of god and our manheid. He is sa full of falls ingyne and
slychtis, that he is now confiderat with Pychtis als weill in perdition of
thaym as of ws, inte^ding yair throw to bring the haill empire of Albioun
(howbeit the samyn was neuir hard before) under Roman obeisance. The Pychtis be
mischant folly passis to battall in support of their professed ennymes, quhilkis
ar rycht desyrus to reif fra thaym yair kingdom and honouris. They come aganys
ws (quhilkis were ay their protectouris) sen first their realm began. It is
vncertane be quhat mischief their Pychtis been abusit, nocht knawyng the
Irrecouerabill damage yat is to fall on yame in euersioun of their common weill
and liberte. And youcht they know the same, they gyf no attendance thairto. it
sa far as pertenis to our actioun, consider that our ennymes ar to fecht aganis
ws, quhome we neuir offendit with iniuris. Throw quhilk their werkis salbe the
more vnchancy and mair odious to god. Be contrar remember e ar to resist their
inuasioun. And in our pur^ defense ar to fecht for our realm and liberte. And
ar the posterity of they forcy campionis that, sumtyme may gloriously chasit
the Romany out of their boundis. Now it is cumyn to sic point, that we mon
other be vincust and suffir extreme misery and servitude, or ellis to be
victouris, and stabill our landis to ws with glore, honor and permanent eyes.
I beseik ow (my good companeonis) for the vnuincibill manheid, faith and virthew
of our eldari^, and for their paill goist^s (quhilkis defendit this our realm
in liberte to their dayis) to suffir nocht ow their sonnis to be rest and spul
eit of our realm, liberteis and gudis, nor it to be taikin (as catiuis) to
underly their tyrannyis. And gyf it hapnis ow be aduers chance (quhilkis god
defend) to de, than do (sa far as in ow) to acquit our deith. And thynk, better
is to de honestly, than to leif in schame. Knawe our self dotat with
incredibill manheid and virtew. And heritouris be ancyant lynnage als weill to
our nobill faderis in wisdom and cheualrye, as in their landis, nocht gaderit
of diverse nationis, bot of ane pepill under ane mind. And seruandis to the
eternal god that geuis victory to Just pepill in reward of their virtew. And
to falls and wrangus pepil schame, discomfiture, and slauchter. Belt ow
thairfore (lusty gallandis) with manheid and wisdom to have victory. Quhilk
sall nocht fail to succeid (gyf e with constant curage have na thing bot
schamful fleyng in dredour). And inuaid our ennymes with siclik cruelte, as
they intend to inuaid ow. Skarsly had Eugenius rasit the spreit of his army be
this hortatioun, quhen Maximus apperit in sycht with all his army. And come
forth wart with more deligence, than was beleuit. For he come sone eftir the
son risyng. Ye Scottis were astonyst be huge multitude of ennymes. Nochtheles
seand na refuge, they de^mit to assail the extreme Ieoperde of armies. Sone
efir they arrayit thaym with their bakkis to the son. That the glance and
beymys thairof should nocht be impediment to their fechting. And skarslie were
they weil arrayit, quhe^ they ruschit forthwart on their ennymes. This feirs
rynnyng was impediment to Maximus to do his deuore. Nochtheles seand the time
sa schort, he exhortit his army to remember ye Roman virtew, and to be not
affrayit of barbar pepil, quhom they recently discomfist. Incontinent both the
armyis be sound of trumpat Iunit with huge nois and clamor on all sidis. At
the first contenyng it was so cruelly fochtin that it was vncertane to quhat
perty may dangeir succedit. Than followit sindry chancis of fortoun. For the
Scottis (ye faucht in the richt wyng under Ethodious to win na les honor than

Dune. Quhair money of yame ouirset with slik and glar yairof were slane than be
proud and insolent glore (as they had been sicker of victory) they stragulit
fra yair fallowes, cassin to spule. Throw quhilk money of thaym were slane eftir
be ane Roman legioun yat was send be Maximus in support of the said Pychtis.
In the last wyng (quhair Doalus faucht) the Scottis met with franchemen,
Britonis and Almanys, quhair yai were slane fechtand with perseuerand manheid to
the deith for defense of their realm. Than all the Roman army be command of
Maximus ruschit on the myddill ward quhair Eugenius faucht with his nobillis
weary and neir vincust be multitude of yair ennymes. Howbeit money of thaym
feirsly repugnant (quhil they mycht) faileit na thing yat pertenit to forcy
campionis. The nobillis (that faucht in Eugenius army) seeing the victory
inclyne to Romany, desyrit Eugenius to saif him be flycht to better fortoun.
And incontinent they raif of his coit armoure par force to make him unknown.
Nochtheles he abaid fechtand with perseuerand malice aganis the Romany. And
was slane ye third eir of his regne. Quhil sic terrible murdir was maid i^ ye
army of scotts, al yair careage me^ (that were left to keip their bestiall and
vittallis) hauand na armoure bot swerdis to defend thaym, and seeing sa money
nobill men slane, be pietuus commiseratioun Ruschit on their ennimes. And were
al slane fechtand to the deith. Quhill the Romany were followyng in the chase
be gre^ Ire and hatrent on yis manner, they fell in ane uncouth manner of
bergane. For the agit and febyll personis (yat war left at hame as vnfensabil
bodyis) rycht desyrus to heir quhat chance was fallyn to their sonnis, come to
the place, quhare the battall was. Bot quhen they saw sa pietuous and
lamentabyl slauchter maid on their sonnis and freindis, they ruschit on their
ennymes like ^^rius creaturis, regardyng nothir life, reason, nor aige. The
women come after with terribyll noyis rummysching as wod rageand beistis and
set on the Romany. Nochtheles both the aigit men and women war fynalye slane.
The Romany passit the nycht followyng with sa huge feir and dredoure, that na
trinchis nor walkyng mycht be sufficient munitioun to their army. For the
hyllis, valis, and lesu^is resoundit all ye nicht with may terribyl spraichis
of ammeryng pepyll in the deidthr^w. For nocht was hard bot ho^rybyll murnyng
of sobband and deand pepyll. Cryand ane vengeance on Romany and Pychtis, be
^uhais treasonabyll slychtis this huge murdir was maid on thaym. On the morrow
Maximus partit the spule of the field amang his army, and maid the deid bodyis
to be buryit. And to schaw him nocht degenerat fra Roman mercy, He maid thaym
(that war left on lyffe and sair woundit) to be curit with may crafty
surrigianis. Amang quhome was Ethodius brothir to Eugenius taken* and curit be
reuth of Maximus of all his woundis*

How the Scottis be great cruelte of pichtis war exilit out of Albion. How ye
abbay of Cokil was fou^dit. ca. xviii.
THe Scottis discomfist in this wise, King Eugenius was found slane. Quhome
Maximus gart bury with funeral obsequies. Syne went with his victorius army
throw syndry boundis of Scotland, and gat money of ye inhabytantis thairof
randerit as he plesit. The Pychtis desyryng the vter exterminioun of Scottis,
tuke hie displeseir, that the said Scottis war sufferit in this wise to leif in
Albioun. Maximus maid him to meis their indignatioun, saying it pertenit to
Roman majesty to have na les mercy on their subdittis, than ferocite above
their conspiratouris and rebellis. It was alsua pr^pir to Romany to conques
pepyll mair be beniuolence than tyranny. For na thing micht degraid mair the
roman glore, than to use cruelteis on their subdewit pepyll. And because the
Scottis war sufficiently punyst for their rebellyoun, their king slane, their
army dyscomfist, and their stre^this taken, he wald inuaid thaym with na forthir
punytyoun, les than they conspirit with new rebellioun. The king of Pychtis and
his nobyllis na thing satyfyit of this answer. Bot erar mouit with mair
indignatioun, desyrit Maximus be money great perswasionis to sla all Scottis in
every part quhare they micht be apprehendit. Saying they war their professed
ennymes borne in their vter exterminioun* and reiosyng only in murdir of
Romany. Othirwayis the Romany and their confiderat freindis mycht have na
sicker felycyte in Albioun. The Pychtis seeing thaym frustrat of their desyris
began to convert thaym to mair slycht. And fynalye corruppit Maximus with large
money, quhylk mouis all mortal creaturis to may terribyll fellonyis. And
purchest all Scottis to be monyst under pane of deid to pas out of Albioun at
ane prefixed day, That their landis and rowmes mycht cu^ in pray to Romany and
Pychtis. The day byrunne all Scottis war exilit, and co^mandit under pane of
may cruel punitioun neuir to return in Albioun. Be this proscriptioun sum
of thaym went in to the Ilis. Otheris in Ireland, Orknay, France, Italy,
Norroway, and Denmark. After proscriptioun of the men, come syndry ladyis of
Scotland arrayit in their dule habit for doloure of their husbandis, quhilkis
war slane in this last battall. And desyrit Maximus with lamentabyll regrait to
suffer thaym leif (as catyuis) the resydew of their miserabyll life within
their natyue land to pray for their husbandis, and fynaly be buryit with thaym
in graif. Bot thai couth purches nocht with all their dolorus teris, bot plane
repuls. And sa the ladyis and gentle women war exilit on the samyn manner as
the men. Their doingis war occasioun to Maximus to detest the inhumaniteis and
cruel maneris of Pychtis. The Pychtis rageand ylk day in mair cruelte after
the day of general proscription, murderit all Scottis (quhare they micht be
apprehendit) but any piete, ransoun, or miseration of their estatis. Quhyll sic
deligent serchyng was maid in all partis, Cartandis queen of Scottis with two
madynnis and ane seruand was found at the sepulture of her husband Eugenius
neir consumit with murnyng and teris. And because scho was the prince of Walis
douchter, scho was brocht to Maximus but any displesoure. Maximus than
remembryng ye vnsicker stait of man, and hauand compassioun of her sorrowful
chance, met her in his honest manner and maid her all the consolatioun he mycht,
and prayit her to be of good confort, for he should treit her (as his fy^t) in
times cummyng. Sone after he cloithit her with honest and semely abulementis,
and gaif her the town of Carrik with syndry rentis and possessyo^is to sustene
her ryal estait. Nochtheles Cartandis nocht vnknawand fra quhat hie felicite
scho was deieckit, Plesandly ressauit the ok of seruytude. And quhen scho was
returnand to the said town of Carrik, scho was taken be the gait be ane cumpany
of Romany and Pychtis. And nocht only spuleit of her horse, clethyng, money,
and Iowellis, bot als her seruandis slane* and her madynnis fuleit. Maximus
aduertist of this outtrage c^issit nocht quhyll the mysdoaris war punyst and
her guddis restorit, Syne preseruit her money dayis after fra all iniure of
ennymes. On the morrow the Pychtis come to Maximus complanyng heualy that their
men war slane be perswasyoun of ane catyue woman ennymy to thaim. And said they
deseruit other kyndnes of Romany, fechtand to ye deith for amplyatioun of
their empire aganis the pepyl with quhylkis they war confyderat to they dayis,
and desyrit thairfore that Cartandis should be exylit in Brytane amang her
freindis. Cartandis heirand their wourdis said scho was bot ane miserabyll
^reature, nakit of her husband and freindis, and wald be mair miserabyll gif
scho beand deiecki^ fra hie felici^e, was repute sa unworthy, that scho mycht
nocht be sufferit to leif amang her ennymes, bot commandit to leif in daily
schame amang her freindis. Howbeit it war mair plesand to her to be in Scotland
praying for the vaileant pepil that was slane with her husband during her sobir
life, than to leyf in honor of any pryncely estait. Fynaly quhen scho had
desyrit outhir to be put haistely to deith, or ellis to be sufferit to leif (as
scho desyrit) in Scotland. Sic commiseratioun ^ais amang the Romany mouit be
her comploratioun that scho was licent (contrar the mind of Pychtis) to remane
in Scotland quhare scho list with rentis and possessionis effering to her
estait. Sic thyngis done, all preistis, monkis, and religious personis of
Scottis blude, war erilit on the same manner out of Scotland. Throw quhylk money
of thaym come in Ilis, and byggit the abbay of Colmekill, quhare money deuoit
personis remanis it to our dayis. Uncertane quhidder the samyn be mair
plentuous of haly women or men, quhilkis leiffis deuoitly in their secret
housis. Quhare throw it happenit that this abbay (howbeit it began soberly be
deuotioun of pepyll and princely rewardis) was maid the co^moun sepulture money
eris ef^er of all Scottis kyngis. And yocht Ethodius brothi^ to Eugenius with
otheris presoneris of scottis war evil woundit in this battal. it they war
exilit after yair curing on ye samyn manner, and sworn nothir to pas in
Ireland, Orknay, nor Ilis, and cons^ranit thairfore to pas in Norroway. The eir
that Scottis war exilit out of Albion be the weris of Romany was fra the
beginning of the world.v. thousand v.C.xlvii. eris. Fra the incarnatioun of
god.iii.C.lxxix. eris. Fra the beginning of Scottis in Albioun.vii.C.xii. eris.
In the secund eir of Iuliane emprioure, quhilk was namit appostita, because
other empriouris before him war catholic pryncis and he ane heretic.

Of syndry maru^lli^ seen in Albioun. How the sctottis (that fled in Ireland
and the Ilis) returnit in Scotland with great power* and how they war
disco^fist and slane. Ca. xix.
IN the eir that Eugenius faucht with Romany war seen money uncouth meruellis
in Albioun to the great terroure of ye pepyll. In ye nycht apperit money swerdis
and wappinnis birnand in the air. Bot at last they ran al togidder i^ ane great
bleis and euanist out of sicht. The watter of Dune ran full of blude, and the
brais of it schane all nycht as it had been full of ythand fyris. Money small
foulis fell out of the air in manner of ane schoure. And incontinent come ane
huge multitude of Rauynnis and deuorit thaym all. Howbeit the deuynouris and
wod women schew that their uncouth and wonderful prodigies sygnyfyit the
exterminioun of Scottis, it they war haldyn in derysyoun to the pepyll and
inhybit to geif faith to sic fretis. Sic felicite succedyng to Romany, and the
scottis beand exilit out of Albioun, Gyllo capitane of Ilis aduertist of the
proscription of Ethoditis in norroway but esperance of his returnyng, had sic
desire to recover his realm yat he come with ane great power i^ Argyle. In ye
mean time his folkis wide skatterit at their incursionis and spuleis, hapnit be
adventure to cum on ane army of Pychtis laid for defense of ye cuntre, be
quhome they war finally chasi^ and slane. All their schippis and galeonis war
brocht to ye nixt port to resist the residew of Scottis* gyf they happinnit to
return with any new army. The men of Ilis brokin on this wise with dowbyll
calamite both with slauchter and tynsall of their schyppis, had na pyssance to
pers^w their ennymes with any forthir battal. The residew of scotts (to eschew
ye Ire and hatrent of romany) fled in Ireland, and pi^tuisly co^planit before
the king and pryncis thairof yt their king Eugenius was slane, and all their
freindes sumtyme may vaileant in marcyall dedis, banyst out of Albion be
tyranny of Romany, Britonis and Pychtis. Quhais cruelteis war sa odiously
schawyn on thaym, yat na estait nor aige war sauit. Bot dreuyn be preis of
battall in uncouth realmis to leif i^ powerte and servitude. Thus was their
nobyll and anciant realm sa lang defendit be vaileant ^a^pionis to they dayis
brocht to vter exterminioun be insaciabyll avarice of Romany, and geuin (as
pray) to Britonis and Pichtis in reward of their falset and ^reason. And
desirit thairfore for the luf and tenderness that nature the crafty modir of all
creatouris, hes ordanit ye pare^tis to haif to their children to support thaim
aganis their unmerciful ennymes, that the scottis sumtyme descendyng of their
blude, and reiosyng the realm of Scotland above.vii.C. eris be nocht brocht to
vter confusioun be Roman weris, sen they ar cumyng to thaym as to their sycker
anchor and last refuge in that extreme neid. The pryncis of Ireland mouit be
commiseratioun of this sorrowful chance falling to Scottis their natyue
pepyll, send.x. thousand Ireland men with thaym in Albion to recover their
realm. This army come in Carrik* Kyle, and Cu^nynghame, and ceissit fra na
manner of cruelte on the Britonis and Pychtis, that war found in they boundis.
Herdur stane brothir to Hergest king of Pychtis before rehersit, beryng sa great
cruelteis done to Pichtis come haistely with ane army to inuaid ye scottis.
Nochtheles he was put to flicht and his army discomfist. Than the scottis tuke
aduysement, quhat was to be done. Sum allegit (howbei^ victory succedit) to
assail nocht ye chance of fortoun any forthir. Bot after this plesand victory
to return in Ireland with the rich spule of m^n and guddis takyn be thaym in
the said battal, and erar to keep thaym to ane better fortoun, than to abide be
manifest folly y^ Roman pissance. Quhylk had sa hye and syngulare preemynence
both in riches and cheualry, that na pepyll mycht resist thairto. Otheris
said, best was to follow fortoun, and recover the remanent landis reft fra
thaym, sen their beginning succedit with sa happy chance, their end should follow
with the mair prosperi^e. For it is often times seen ye great multitude of pepyl
been vincust be few men. And thairfore i^ esperance of bett fortoun best was to
raise their curage, and outhir recouir their native realm, or all atanis to de.
This last opinioun was apprisit. Than the Scottis and Ireland men tuke full
purpos to recouir all the remanent landis, that pertenit to thaym be any tityll
or law in Albion. At last quhen they had fochtyn with may rageand fury aganis
their ennymes, na better fortoun succedit to thaim, tha^ succedit before to ye
men of Ilis. For few of thaym eschapit vntakyn, or slane with Romany. The
princis and nobillis of Ireland richt affrayit of their tithingis, co^uenit to
ane cou^sall to have consultatioun, how the scottis mycht be restorit to their
realm, and the Romany best resistit. And quhen they saw na sufficient remeid
for the samyn, they set aside all other materis, and concludit to send their
oratouris to have peace of Romany. The ambassatouris (y^ come to this effect)
war reprouit be Marimus, quhy they supportit the Scottis aganis the Romany,
consydering na realms in erd (saif Ireland) war fre of Roman weris to they
dayis. it peace was grantit to thaym under their conditionis, ye princis and
nobillis of Ireland sall resset na ennymes of romany within their realm in
tymis cumyng, and they sal make na support to thaym, that mouis any weris
aganis ye Romany or their confiderat freindis. Na theiffis nor lymma^es of
Ireland, sal cum to do erandis in tymis cummyng in Albiou. The peace ratifpit
in this manner followit na trubyll after in Albioun be Ireland.

And sa endis heir the sext bu^e of their Croniklis.

Heir begynnis the seuynt buke of the croniklis of Scotland:
How Maximus conquest be his lyberalite the crown of Britane. How he slew
Gratiane emprioure, and was slane be Theodosius. Ca. primo.
MAximus hauand trubyll of ennymes dantit in all partis with sicker peace, to
make his prudent maneris mair patent, schew him sa beniuolus to the pepyl, y^
na man was denyit his presence, and had with him i^ daily fallowschip money of
the great nobyllis of Brytane, and tretit thaym sa plesandly, that syndry of
thaym war drawin to his favor. For quhen he ceissit fra publict materis, he
gaif his ingyne to tornamentis, warslyng* and other knich^ly exercitioun with
Britonis. and become sa liberal, that he gave on ane day amang thaym mair tha^
all the tribute of Britane mycht extend to for ane eir. All the weirmen and
knichtis in his camp war perswadit to take his part be his liberalite aganis
quhat sum euir ieoperdeis y^ mycht fall. Maximus knawyng the myndis of his army
geuyn with sic fervent amyte to him* set ane conuentioun at ork, and partit all
y^ landis partenand sumtyme to Scottis amang the Pichtis and Britonis. Sic
thyngis done he garnist all the strenthis of Britane with men, munitionis and
vittallis. Syne callit before him all his freindis and men of armies (quho^ he
knew may favorable to his desiris) and demandit thaym be quhat ingyne or
wayis he mycht may easily conques the crown of Britane. The Britonis knawyng
his imperial lynnage and liberalite with hie manheid and craft of cheualrie
creat him king. Yocht Paulus Diaconus writtis that he was maid king contrar his
will, I will follow my auctouris before rehersi^, erar than uncouth
historicianis. Ualentiniane empriour knawing yt Maximus had vsurpit ye crown of
Britane, send diverse capitanis and armyis to dant his rebellioun. At last quhen
he persauit ye said Maximus inuincibill in battal and money of his capitanis and
armyis discomfist and slane, he condiscendit lychtly to have peace with the
said Maximus. Thus was Maximus sufferit be the empriour to reiose the crown of
Britane, quhilk he gouernit.xvii eris after but truble. Hauand the hale empire
of Albion under his dominion. Quhilk hapnyt neuir before to leuand creature. He
had the Pichtis in sic familiarite, that ye strangest of thaym were chosin
capitane in his army. And other maid sodiouris in sindry castellis of Britane.
And quhen he come in yair la^dis, he clotthit him with mantil bordorit with
gold and silkin flouris eftir their gyse* and of thaym desyrit nocht bot ane
small tribute to be ane memorial, yat they were tributaris to him in name of
romany. The Pychtis and Britonis deliuerit thus of al deidly feir of scottis,
had Maximus in na les luf yan vehement affection, And reiosit that the Scottis
yair auld ennymes were exilit out of Albioun and put to vter rewyne. Quhen
Maximus had gouernit the crown of Britane certane eris with great manheid and
prudence, he began be insaciable avarice to couate the haill empire of the
world. And to conqueir the samyn, he went in France eftir that he had stuff^^
all the strenthis of Britane with strange munitioun and wageouris. At his cumyng
in France he was tenderly ressauit be certane legionis of romany, quhilkis
were ennymes to Graciane emprioure. And bure him in deidlie hatrent. Because he
had uncouth and barbar pepill in more reverence than Romany. Maximus fauo^it
be this mean be ye Romany in France, gaderit ane army with all pissance that he
mycht assemble, and be suddane incursionis slew Graciane empriour the.xxix. eir
of his empire. Eftir this slauchter Maximus went throw Almany, and Italy. And
be feir of his only fame he co^stran^^ the people to pay him tribute*
Nochttheles he was finalie slane be Theodosius emprioure. Als sone as the
Romany (quhilkes were left i^ France) knew ye slauch^er of Maximus, they tuke
in continent his son namy^ Uictour. And spuleit him both of his auctorite
and life. As Paulus Diaconus writis at lenth in the life of Graciane and
Theodosius empriouris.

How octauius was maid king of Brytonis. How Mercius and Victoryne were send
in Albioun to dant the Britonis. How the Pychtis war thirllit to great
servitude. and how their king slew him self. Ca* ii.
THe roman princis beand deuidit on this manner amang thaym self. Octauius
son to Octauius king of Britane before rehersyt returnit in britane for he
fled (as we schew) in France to eschew the tyranny of Maximus, quhen he
subdewit Britane to his opinion. And clamyt the crown to pertene to him as Just
heritoure discending of the blud tyall thairof be lang progression. And
promittit (gyf they condiscendit to his opinion) to deliver thaym of Roman
servitude. And to suffer nane bot yair native blud to regne above thaym in
times cumyng. The Britonis mouit be his reasonis, and rycht desirus to recover
yair liberte maid him king. The Romany (quhilkis kepit the strenthis and
munitionis of Britane) were repugnant to their doyngis. Thus apperit great
contentioun. The Britonis set to defend Octauius, and ye Romany to keip
Britane under the empire of Theodosius empriour. This rebellion of Britonis was
occasion to the empriour to send new capitanis with money Roman legionis to
dantye Britonis. Bot quhe^ he fand they mycht nocht be ouirthrawin be force of
arms. He gaif thaym peace under yir conditionis. Octauius sall remane king of
Britane during his life and amyte with Romany. The munitionis and strenthis of
Britane to be kepit be ye Romany. The administratioun of Justice to be at ye
will of Theodosius. Quhome he list depute for the samyn. Paying siclike tribute
to ye empriour as they payit before to Maximus. Thus was Britane maid tributar
(as before) to Romany. Nocht lang eftir two capitanis were send with money
legionis in Britane. That ane namit Marcius to make his residence at Londoun.
And this other namyt Uictoryne to remane at ork. Be governance of their two
capitanis followit money eris eftir great affliction to ye Albianis. For
Uictoryne conuenyt ye Pichtis to ane cou^sal, and repruuit yame for vsyng of
their awin lawis, in co^temptioun of Roman auctorite as thai had been fre
pepil. Nocht astric kit to the empriouris servitude. Eft sindry consultationis
he maid actis that nane of Pichtis sall regne eftir Hergest, na ministration of
Justice to be maid be their awin lawis bot only be Romany. And the said
Romany to have above thaym in times cumyng the auctorite of life and deith.
And gyf they were found repugnant to their constitutionis to be punyst to the
deith. Hergest king of Pychtis thirllit thus to vile servitude in his latter
age, was penitent of the weris maid before aganis the Scottis, seeing eftir their
proscriptioun sa intolerable calamyteis apperyng bai^h to his people than
present and to their posterite. And because he couth nocht put remeid yair to
for vehement dolor he slew him self. Uictoryne knawing this unhappy end of
Hergest, co^mandit that na pychtis blude usurp the crown in times cumyng. And
ye nane of yani^ beir office nor auctorite under pane of deith, with all other
chargis to be obseruat (quhilkis they were thi^lli^ to be Maximus) quhen he
exilit the Scottis. Yus was ye realm of Pichtis spuleit of their native lawis
and subdewit to Romany in manner of province, siclik as ye realm of Britonis.
Ye Pichtis hauand the chargis of Uictoryne in derisioun were rycht impacie^t to
suffir ye crown be reft fra yair native blud. And maid Dur^us ye son of Hergest
to be their king. Uictoryne mouit for their rebellion thocht best to dant yame
before they gaderit any more pissance, and come haistely in Pentland with great
ordinance. The Pychtis in Camelon with their new king heirand the cumyng of
Uictoryne, began to garnys their town with all prouisioun. Nochtheles sooner
than they ^raistit the Romany beltit their town with strange seige and tuke it
finalie be force of arms. In this town was taken king Durstus, and send to
Rome to underly the Judgment of Roman Senatouris. The principal mouares of
this rebellioun were scurgit with wandis throw ye town of Camelon The Pychtis
dantit be Uictoryne in this manner, were co^mandit to pay eirlie to the Roman
Thesaurer ye fourt part of all the frutis growand on their landis, with the
feird part of their bestial under pane of deith. For he ^hocht ye Pychtis sa

dantit in time) money hie offencis mycht rise be thaym in Albion. And by all
their importable chargis, he thirllye thaym to may vile servitude. And send
thaym in Britane and other realms to wy^ mettellis, querrellis, and to make
tyld. And above all their calamyteis their come to thaym ane mair insufferable
iniure deuisit in final destruction of their realm* For within schort time
eftir, they were co^mandi^ to pas with yair wyffis, children, and guddi^ under

Abircorne to Dunbriton to divide thaym fra Britonis. And gyf any Pychtis
transcendit this dyke to be punist na les than they had offendit aganis ye
majesty of Romany. The Pychtis greuit with their and money other intollerabill

Of Ethodius brothir to Eugenius before rehersit. Of his governance in Denmark
and of his successioun. How Rome was taken be Gothis, and how syndry spuleis
thairof fell to Fergus the secund. Ca. iii.
QUhill ye Pichtis wir punyst with their and money other afflictionis, ye Scottis
were vagabound and banist in uncouth realms with their wyffis and children. Sum
of thaym leuand on the laubour of their handis. Otheris beand wageouris and men
of armies under sindry princis and capitanis of ye world. Ethodius brothir to
Eugenius, banist (as we have schawin) with his wife out of Albioun, was
plesandly tretit be the king of Denmark. And gat certane landis, quhair he
remani^ with his wife. On quhom he gat ane son namyt Erthus. Thus Erthus
eftir ye deith of his fader Ethodius, maryit ane nobill lady namyt Rocha
douchter to Rorik, quhilke was gretest prince of Danis under the king. And gat
on her ane son namyt Fergus the secund. Quhilk recouerit the realm of
scotland as we sall now schaw. This Fergus in his flurisand outh past be

Alarike king of Gothis. Quhilk at that time was passand with huge army to
confound and distroy ye empire of Romany. Fergus was rycht glaid of this
woyage. For he bure extreme hatrent aganis ye Romany, because that slew his
eldaris, or ellis banist thaym fra their native realm in uncouth regionis,
fynalie eftir money battallis fochtyn be sindry chancis of fortoun betuix the
Romany and Gothis, Radagasus principal capitane of yis army bea^d slane with
infinite nowmer of pepill, and the Romany siclike brokin with their army and

Gothis. The Romany debaitit the town lang time be sindry ieoperdyis. Quhil at
last they laikit vittallis. Throw quhilk was sic hunger amang thaym, that they
abhorrit nocht to eit ye flesche of men with other sindry forbodin metis. In
deploratioun of yis calamyte my ^oce (sayis sanct Jerome) astonisis, and the
sobbyng cuttis my wourdis. Ye town is taken, that tuke al ye world, vincust more
be hunger yan swerd. And few found on live within the samyn. Sa far sprang the
hungry raige, that it constranyt the pepill to eit abominable meitis. The
mod^r sparit nocht to swelly ye fruit of her awin bowellis. Thus was Rome
fynalie expugnant be Gothis ye first day of Apprile fra the beginning of it be
Romulus.i.M.i.C.lxiiii. eris. Fra ye incarnation of god.iiii.C.xii. eres. Als
sone as Rome was taken The Gothis ceissit fra slauchter of the pepill. And fra
spule^ng of the tempillis of the Appostillis Peter and Paul. Throw quhilk money
pepill (that fled thairto) were sauit of their guddis and liuis. Rome sumtyme
the lady of the world was spuleit thus be cruelte of Gothis. And the spuleis of
it deuidit be ryte of arms amang the Gothis. It is said that beside money rich
iowellis and precious geir that fell to Fergus ye secund be ye said spule, ane
kissed was geuyn to him full of bukis, quhilkes be brocht out of Italy with
incredibill laubour and deligence in Almany. And send it to remane in Colmekill
with money other cronikillis and historyis of Scotland, vncertane be quhayis

in the Ilis of Scotland, to se gyf he mycht find any of the werkis of Titus
Liuius quhilk is were distroyit at this time be cruel weris of Italy. For ma
notabill thingis been distroyit be battall than be ^oust o^eris. Nochtheles fra
the said Eneas knew the passage dangerus (because the king was slane) he left
his purpos. And we of that samyn manner rycht desirus to know, quhat bukis this
been) quhais fame was sa diuulgat in all partis) maid (...) deligence. That at
last five auld bukis wryttyn in Roman letteris war brocht to ws at Abirdene be

nocht reid ilk tent wourd. And quhiddir their bukis were ane part of thaym that
were distroyit be the said weres of Italy, or gyf yai were brocht to the said
abbay out of uncouth and strange placis, it is vncertane. it be testimonial of
thaym that red ye samyn, we find they soundit mair to the eloquence of
Salustius, than of Liuius. Forthir at this same time was brocht to ws be the
same messengeir, ye werkis of Ueremund Archedene of Sanctandrowis* contenand
the history of this realm fra the first beginning thairof to king Macolme
Ca^mores time. Quhilkis authouris we have followit with the may wise bischop
William Elphinstoun to the end of these our quhat sumeuir werk. Bot we will
retourn to our history. Fergus the son of Erthus departit out of Rome with
Alarik three dayis eftir it was put to sakke. And went with him to the
expugnation of sindry other townis in Italy. Nocht lang eftir he was ordanit
to pas with certane schippis in Sicil. And in ye mean time raise sa unmerciful
tempest on him, that he was dreuin be force of contrarius wyndis agane in
Italye and narrowly eschapit of his life. At his retournyng Alarike was
deceissit, and Athalphas maid king of Gothis, and general capitane of their
army. With quhome Fergus become sa beluffit for his singular manheid and
virtew, that (als sone as Italye was dantit be the Gothis) he was sufferit to
return hame with money Danys in Denmark full of riches and treasoure gottyn the

will return to our hystory. The Pychtis seeing thaym ylk day m^ir tormentit with
roman in^u^^s, and yrkit with importabyl seruytude, send their secret
messengeris to the Scottis, quhilkis war exilit in ye Ilis* Ireland, and
Norway. Desyryng thaym to return in Albion to recover their realm. And
promyttit be their great aithis other to restore the Scottis to their realm and
landis or ellis to fecht in their support to the deith aganis the Romany and
Britonis. Quhen Fergus had hard their desyris of Pychtis, he send b^ advise of
the king of Denmark, his traist seruandis in all partis, quhare any Scottis war,
to explore their myndis towart him. And quhe^ he fand thaym all of ane mind to
recover their realm, and revenge the iniuris done to thaym be Romany and
Britonis, he co^ducit ane great nowmer of schippis and weirmen part with the
riches he wan in the weris of Italy, and part be support of his gudschir Roryk

How Gratiane king of Britonis, and Mercius Roman capitane war slane. and
Constantine put in Mercius place. and of his deith. Of the secund message send
be Pichtis to Fergus. And how he come in Albioun, and was aggreit with
Pichtis and recouerit his realm. Ca. v.
During this time Gratiane Brytone be consent of Mercius Roman capitane tuke
ye crown of Brytane. This trubyl was sone pecifijt. For sic contention raise
betuix thaym that ylk ane of thaym slew other. The Romany rycht sorrowful for
the deith of their capitane chesit constantyne but advise of Honorius empriour
to succeed in Mercius place. This constantyise was nocht ane man of nobyll
blude nor it of mercyal werkis. Als sone as he was chosyn capitane* he went in
France with ane army to deliver the samyn fra iniure of Gothis and Swi^^^s,
quhar^ he was vincust be ane nobyl knycht namyt Constantius and slane. Als sone
as Uyctoryne knew the slauchter of Mercius and Constantyne, he went to London,
and garnist all the strenthis of brytane wi^^ strange munition and weirmen. And
set his ingyne money wayis to hald the Brytonis at the opinioun of Honorius
empriour. For the empire of Romany was inuadit with great rebellyoun in all
partis. The Pichtis seeing the Britonis haldyn with great difficulte at the
opinion of Romany, beleuit fermely (gyf the Scottis war brocht agane in Albion
and concurryng to their support) to recover their liberte, And for their causis,
yai send their secund message to Fergus, schawyng sa great trubyl in Britane
amang the Romany, that na time mycht cum sa ganand as than to recover his
realm. Sone after Fergus pullit up salis* and arriuit in Murray, quhare he set
his army on land. The fame of his cumyng diuulgat throw Albion, causit the
scottis out of all partis to conuene to him with their wyffis and children on
ye same manner as their ennymes had been chasit and vincust, and as they war to
remane perpetually in their native landis but any forthir trubyll. Than come
syndry Pychtis in great cu^panyis to Fergus thankyng him that he for syngulare
lufe to recover his natyue realm, was cumyn in Albion nocht astonist of the
winter storms nor dangeir of feis, quhen passage been may parellus, and
desyrit him to set on side all iniuris, (gif any war in times bygane) betuix
Scottis and Pichtis, that they mycht be new confiderat after the tennour of ye
auld peace. And prayit him to imput na falt to thaym for ye wekit offencis
committit aganis the nobyll king Eugenius his progenitour, Bot to imput ye same
allanerly to their fore eldaris, quhylkis ^uld nothi^ for that time have
experience of the dissait of Romany nor i^ understand quhat vengeance and
calamyte was apperyng to thaym be the weris maid aganis the Scottis, quhen they
beand dissauit be plesand wordis of Romany in damage of their commoun weill
brocht thaym self to intollerabyl servitude. Throw quhylk they war sa cruelly
punyst, yat every kind of deith was to be preferrit to roman dominion. To this
answerit Fergus, he wald gladly have peace and amyte with Pichtis with siclyke
condicionis as they war before confiderat with his progenitouris, and wald
ieoperde him self with thaym in battall contrar romany and Britonis their auld
and perpetual ennymes* and fecht to the deith for their commoun weill to
revenge the iniuris done to thaym. Swa that the said pichtis wald plesandly
depart with their wiffis, children, and guddis out of the landis quhilkis war
treasonably reft before fra the scottis, as to ye auld iniuris of ye said
Pychtis, he thocht thaym sufficiently punist be just punitioun of god for their
offense. S^n they war nocht only reft and spulei^ of their natyue landis, Bot
thirllit to may vile and intollerabyl servitude. The Pichtis content of their
desyris creat ane king, and set ane day to meit Fergus. At the day affixit the
scottis and Pychtis war confiderat togidder after ye auld band in may souer
way yt mycht be deuysit. Sic thingis done Fergus ressauit all the landis and
strenthis that war reft fra his progenitouris before be Roman weris. And sone
after he past with ane honest cumpany to Argile, quhare he was crownit in the
fatal^ chiar of merbyll. The eir that Fergus recouerit his realm was the.x^v.
eir after that the scottis war expellit out of Albion. Fra the
incarnation.iiii.C.xxii. eris. Fra the first beginning of scottis.vii. hundredth
lv. eris. In the.xviii. eir of Honorius emprioure,

How the Romany fechtand aganis the Scottis and Pichtis war seuerit be ane
schoure of hayll. Of syndry vassalage done be the vaileant Grahame at the wall
of Abircorne. Of his lynage and allya with king Fergus. Ca. vi.
VIctoryne co^mouit that Scottis war brocht agane on yis manner in Albioun,
assemblit ane army and come to ork. After his cu^myng he send ane herald to the
Pychtis, sol^^^ad thaym with money large promyssis to dissolve ye band maid
lait^^ with Scottis. At last seeing his (...) cum to little effect, he began to
(...) the Pichtis, as falls and maynswo^ne pepyll. And to be wrokyn of their
rebellyoun he come with ane army of.l.M. men throw Kendell, Mers, and Pentland,
to the great damage of the pepyll thairof, and set down his tentis nocht far
fra Camelon. Fergus aduertist of ye cumyng of romany in this manner (for both
he and the king of Pichtis war gaderit with ane great army) come ouir forth. And
within ye nycht set down his tents nocht far fra his ennymes with delyuerit mind
to assail yame in the brek of the day. The Romany on the tothir side knew
weil the ordinance of Scottis and Pichtis* And at the third vigill maid thaym
reddy to battall, and faucht with the confiderat kingis beside the watter of
Carron. This battall was rycht cruelly fochtyn, and sa great multitude of pepyl
slane yat the said watter ran money mylis with purpoure stremis to the seis.
Quhill their armyis war fechtand on this manner with vncertane victory, come
suddanly ane scharp schoure sa full of haill and sleit, ye nane of thaym mycht
know ane other. Throw quhylk yai war constranit to sever mair yrkit than saciat
of otheris slauchter. Thus war both the armyis sa brokyn, that money eris after
nane of thaym micht inuaid other be battal. Uictoryne on the morrow seeing his
army brokyn returnit in Kent, and left behynd him money sodyouris i^ Pentland to
keep the samyn in manner of prouynce aganis the Scottis and Pichtis. The
confiderat kyngis co^mandit the residew of their pepyll (quhylkis war left on
live) to return hame. And because yai fand yame self vnabyll to renew battal
they set their ingyne to saif both thaym self and their landis to ane better
fortoun. Sone after they conuenit in Argile to se quhat wayis they micht best
resist their ennymes, reuengyng the iniuris be thaym done, and to learn their
pepyll the art of cheualry. For they war money eris abusit but any exercition
thairof. After syndry consultationis the Scottis seeing the Pichtes of mair
nowmer, than micht be nurist i^ Angus, Fiffe, Striueling and Stratherne,
sufferit thaym to remane in Athole beond the hyllis of Graneben, quhyll they
mycht be sum better fortoun recover the resydew of yair landis. quhilkes war
reft fra thaym be tyranny of Ramanis. The Pychtis spread fast in Athole, and
maid syndry strenthis and polecy (...) in it. In the mean time Uictorine
capitane of Britane, co^mandit the Britonis be general edict to byg ye wall
betuix Abircorne and Dunbritane with staik and rise in their stra^gest manner to
saif thaym fra invasion of scottis and pichtis, And to big yis dike war
assemblit money craftismen out of al partis with syndry weirmen to fai^ thaym
quhyl ye dyke was byggit. In ye mean time (quhe^ they war bigga^d it may
besaly) come ye vailea^t Grahame (quhais dochter was ma^yit on king Fergus) and
slew ane great nowmer of their weirmen at the bygging of this dike, and ye
remanent put to flicht. And incontinent be fers incursio^ he brocht ane huge
pray of men and gudis fra ye Britonis in the scottis landis. This Grahame was
disce^dit of ane anciant house of De^mark, and gottin on ane nobyll lady of yat
samyn cuntre be ane of ye scottis yat was banist with Ethodius out of Albion.
And after ye proscription of scottis, he maryit ane virgin of ye blude rial of
Denmark on quhom he gat ane dochter of may excellent bewte, quhilk was geuyn
to Fergus in marriage. Fergus gat on her.iii. sonnis before his cumyng in Albion,
quhais names war Eugenius, Dongarus, and Constancius. Of quhome salbe our
history followyng. Uthir sayis this Grahame was ane Bryton, quhilk eschewyng
the Roman tyranny, fled am^ng the scottis, and was after banist with thaim in
Denmark, For he was great ennyme to romany, seeing thaym regne with sic tyranny
and avarice above their subdittis Always of quhat sumeuir house or lynnage he
was discendit, treuth is he was ane man of hie curage and spreit both in weir
and peace. and strangest ennyme to romany and Britonis. Of this Grahame
discendit the surname of Grahamis.

Of syndry consultationis maid be ye scottis for their defense aganis ye
Romany and britonis. How Victorine conquest the crown of Britane* and how
he was punist yai^fore to ye deith. ca. vii.
THe britonis brokin with syndry battallis in this manner, ceissit money eris
after fra batall, content to defend yair a win lands. At this time come
infinite nowmer of scottis out of France, Spane, Almany, Italy, and other
pertis (quhair they war wageouris) to king Fergus, traisting (because sa huge
rebellion was maid in all realms aganis Romany) to recover their landis in
Albion. Fergus reiosing of their cumyng went with thaym i^ Carrik, quhare he
faucht with ye Romany, and gat na les displeseir than he gat before. Throw
quhilk he was co^stranit to leif Carrik, and return to Argyle* quhare he
remanit all the winter followyng. Ane conuentioun was maid be him in the nixt
symer, In quhylk syndry of his noblis perswadit him to raise new army to resyst
Uyctoryne (for he was cumyn than in Galloway) and erar to ieoperd him to
extreme dangeir of battall, than daily to leif in sic afflictioun. Otheris said
best was to tarry and nocht to fecht with the Romany. Because they war twyis
dyscomfist, in adventure gyf they war dyscomfist the thryd time, their realm
should be pray to their ennymes. Best was thairfore to ceis fra battall* Quhyll
their pyssance war conualescit. Be quhylk they mycht be the mair abyll to
resyst. Attour sa frequent rebellyoun was maid aganis the Romany in all
partis, that Uyctoryne mycht nocht lang abide in Brytane. And thairfore sen the
Empire of Romany apperis sa manifestlye to declyne, It may happyn that
Uyctoryne be constranit to fle out of Brytane, and than the Scottis and Pichtis
may have ane ganand oportunite to recouir their realm but any great da^geir.
This last counsall was apprisit. And sa it was concludit that scottis and
pichtis sall inuaid their ennymes mair be scarmussyng, than plane battall. In
the mean time Honorius emprioure tuke great suspitioun aganis these Uictorine,
traisting that he should vsurp the crown of Britane. Thus was it demit be money
pepyll, that the empriour should exone^ Uictoryne of al auctorite in Britane. Als
sone as Uictorine was aduertist thairof, he tuke the crown of Britane with
incredibyll favor of his army. Part of Britonis assistit ^o (...), bot
otheris followit the (...) of Dioneth son to king Octauius before deceissit.
Apperit thus great seditioun in Britane. Nochtheles Honorius empriour seeing sa
great trubyll rysyng in Brytane, send ane vaileant knycht namit Heraclius to
dant thayr rebellyoun, Quhais cummyng maid the Britonis and otheris that
assistit to Uictoryne (sa astonist^ yat yat brocht Uictoryne bound to this
Heraclius with money otheris quhilkis war mouaris of their rebellioun. Sone
after Uictoryne was send to Rome with money otheris of his opinioun, and punist
to ye deith. Thus was Britane brocht agane be Heraclius to roman empire.

How Placidus Roman capitane was discomfist with his army be Scottis and
Pychtis. How king Fergus recouerit all hi^ landis be conditioun of peace (...)
a Romany. Of his cyuyl and religious industry for the vveil of his pepyll. Ca.
viii.
HEraclius, quhen he had brocht Britane on this manner to roman opinioun be
command of Honorius, he returnit to Rome, and went in Affric to dant ye
rebellion of Athalus tyranne, and left behynd him in Britane ane man of febyl
curage namit Placidus, quhylk throw his auaryce was found richt vnabyll to
govern any prouynce. Fergus knawyng weill the febyll curage of Placidus,
thocht ye time ganand to recover the landis reft fra him before be Roman weris.
And sone after he come with ane army in Carrik abydyng the cummyng of the king
of Pychtis with his army. Als sone as the Scottis and Pychtis war met togydder,
they went throw Carrik, Kyle, Cunynghame, and Galloway ceissing fra na manner of
cruelte on thaym that obeyit to the empire of Romany. And on the same manner,
they come in Pentland, Mers, and Berwyk, and left nothir Romany nor Britonis
in the same. Placidus capitane of Brytane herand their attemptatis, come with
ane huge army in Pentland. Ye Scottis and pichtis nocht affrayit of his cuming
met him with great fury. Followit ane terribyll and fair battall, and first ye
horsemen of Romany war discomfist. And sone after the remanent legionis war ^a
oppressed with ytha^d schot of arrowis, yat they gaif bakkis on the same manner.
Than was ane sorrowful slauchter maid on the flearis. Placidus narrowlye
eschapyng of his ly^^e fled to ork. The confiderat pepyll insolent after this
victory, tuke purpos to sege ork. Nochthel^s their army was sa brokyn, that
they war constranit to desist. Placidus na les astonist be money other
afflyctionis falling to Romany in syndry pertis of ye world, than be this last
discomfitoure, dred that Britane should pas fra Roman dominioun gif the Britonis
mouit any new rebellyoun. And thairfore he began to seik peace with Pichtis and
Scottis. Than was peace fynaly tretit under their conditionis, al la^dis and
munitionis reft before fra scottis and Pychtis be Roman tyranny salbe restorit
to thaim agane. Na incursionis nor heirschyppis sall be maid in times cumyng be
Scottis and Pichtis in the Roman landis. The romany sall stand content with
the landis conquest on ye Britonis, and sall nocht inuaid ye Scottis nor
Pichtis with any weris i^ tymis cumyng. Als sone as ye confiderat kyngis had
ressauit their landis and rowmes be this manner, they gaif their exact delygence
to instruct their pepyll in plesand and civil maneris but any thirllage of
seruytude. Tha^ Fergus to incres the Scottis, Danis, and otheris yat come with
him to recover their realm under ane freindschip and blude, gaif syndry la^dis
of his realm amang thaym. Throw quhilk money landis of his realm tynt their
auld name, and was callit after the name of the new possessouris. And because
the name of every land in Scotland ar weill knawin to all scottis. I will schaw
na thing thairof. Than Fergus reparit all the kirkis that war faileit be
necligence of the pepyll and feft syndry preistis with rentis and possessionis
to do deuyne service. He brocht all the monkis (that war banyst) agane to his
realm and treti^ thaym with great reverence to instruct his pepyll in the
faith. He biggit the abbay of Colmekyll and dotat it with syndry landis,
rentis, and possessionis. And commandit the samyn to be in times cumyng ye
commoun sepulture of all kyngis succedyng after him. He feft als certane
funeral obsequies to be done eirly for their saulis. This Fergus was geuyn als
weill to civil as religious maneris. For he reparit all the strenthis lyand on
his bordouris fornentis ye brytonis, quhare he ordanit his agit sodiouris to
remane perpetually for defense thairof on ye co^moun purs.

Of the deith of Placidus. Of y^ message send be Castius capitane of britane to
Fergus, and of Fergus answer. How the Romany war discomfist and Castius
slane, Ca. ix.
QUhen Fergus had recouerit his realm in this manner, and restorit his pepyl to
their anciant hono^ris and dignite, deceissit Honor^us emprioure. After quhom
succedit Theodosius quhilk send ane nobyll man namit Ualentiniane in Italy, to
repare all dammagis done be civil weris. And in ye mean time Placidus capitane
of Brytane deceissit. The Scottis and Pychtis traistyng to have good occasyon be
deith of Placidus to inuaid the Britonis. (For peace was dissoluit be his
deith) come in west mureland, Cumber, and vthir regionis (that war taken fra
thaym before be roman weris) and ^eissit fra na manner of cruelte on thaym, that
obeyit the Romany. Money of the Brytonis fled to Castius. For he was maid
capitane of Brytane after the deith of Placidus. This Castius dredand (ye thing
that come after) that Dioneth son of Octauius before rehersit should usurp the
crown of Brytane be assistence of Scottis and Pychtis (for he marijt Fergus
sister) send to Fergus, chargeand him be ane herald (gyf he desyrit peace and
to leif on the auld landis and marchis pertenand to his eldaris) to inuaid na
otheris. And gif he desyrit nocht bot battall he maid him to understand he had
the samyn ennymes yt dang his eldaris out of Albioun, and thirllit the Pychtis
to servitude. To this charge was answerit be Scottis and Pychtis. They wald
have na peace (...) Romany, quhyll Westmure^^^^ and Cumber war restorit to
^^aym with all the munitionis and (...) thairof. Castius greuit with this
answer, come forthwart with his army. And quhen he was cumyn throw the Roman
prouynces nocht far fra Westmureland, he was aduertist yat Dioneth was cu^mand
with ane great power out of Wal^s in support of Scottis and Pychtis. The
Brytonis knawyng ye feirsnes and cruelte of welcheme^, war astonist be their
tythynges* nochtwithstandyng be hortation of Castius, they rasit yair spreit*
and come the third day after rycht desyrus of battal in their ennymes sycht.
Now was Dioneth and the confiderat pepyll mengit with their oistis togidder,
and weill arrayit for battal, quhen suddandly both the armyis iunit, and
faucht lang with doutsum victory. Quhyll at last the wageouris (that faucht in
the wyngis with lycht armor) gaif bakkis. Followit an^ huge affray amang the
Romany, and the samyn was ye mair e^kit be slauchter of Castius their
capitane, and incontinent the myd battall fled, on quhome followit the Scottis,
Pichtis and welchemen with lang chase and murdir. it because they keipi^ na
ordoure in their chare, they gat mair skaith than they did to their ennymes.
The Romany discomfist on this wise, colleckit the resydew of their army
togidder. and past in walis, and left behynd thaym all the strenthis of the
cuntre but any defense.

How Maximiane capitane of Britane come with huge army aganis the Scottis and
Pichtis. Of Fergus orison to his army, and how both the kyngis of Scottis and
Pychtis war slane* and their army disco^fist be romany. Ca. x.
DIoneth after this discomfitour of romany, tuk ye town of Britane, and
inuadit all the pepyl thairof with great cruelte and slauchter that obeit to
Romany. Thus apperit Britane (bot gif this trubyll war the mair haistely
dantit) to pas fra dominion of romany. At this time was in France ane nobyll
man namit Etius* general capitane thairof be auctorite of the emprioure. This
Etius heryng (that Britane was nakit of support) send be desire of Brytonis ane
vaileant knycht namit Maximiane to dant all this trubyll appering be
welschemen, Scottis and Pychtis. Maximiane come sone after with ane army in
Albion, quhom the Brytonis ressauit with great triumph, and prayt god to send
him ane good fortoune aganis his ennymes. Maximiane knawyng mair trubyll
apperyng by rebellyon of Dioneth* than be any vthir danger occurring (for he
was of the blude ryal of Brytane) thocht lang tarry impediment to his weris. And
come with his army in may delygence to ork. And sone eft he come in
Westmureland. The confiderat kyngis heryng his cumyng, come with their armyis
in ye same manner. And in ye mean time come to thaym Dioneth king of britane
with all his power out of walis. At the spring of ye day (quhen al their power
was mengit togidder) Fergus callit thaym be sound of tru^pat to his standart,
and said on this wise. I wald (wise freindis) that yis battall (quhilk we are
now to leid aganis our may dangerus ennymes) war fo^htin with sa huge
ma^heid, curage, and spreit, that the samyn may be to our honor and proffet,
and to my hie pleseir and glaidnes. Suthly will e ponder this matter wisely,
our myndys (that been sa lang distra^kit fra eyes and sa occupyit with ythand
exercitioun of cheualry) should be ereckit i^ great espera^ce of victory, seeing
our ennymes in sicht quhom e sa often before discomfist and chasit. It semis all
forcy campionis euir to belief ye best, and haif excellent fortitude aganis
quhat sumeuir aduersite that may occur. For fortitude is so hie and souerane
virtew, that it perswadis every nobyll man be impulsioun of nature to resist
aduersite. This virtew is mair renownit to resist the iniure of ennymes, tha^
to inuaid thaym with any iniure. For he yt is wra^gusly iniurit, hes ay good
espera^ce of bett fortoun to follow. Thus incressis he strange be esperance, and
be his just querall he growis prudent. Be contrare he ya^ dois wrang, is
iniurius to him self, and hes na espera^ce of good fortoun to follow. Maximus
sumtyme capitane of Britane be his treasonabyll slychtis was confiderat with
pichtis, na les for ye exterminion of thaym, tha^ of scottis. As the end
thairof schew. They slew my gudschyr Eugenius with money of our nobyll eldaris
and put thaym to sic affliction, that they war money eris exilit this regioun,
throw quhylk he conquest the hayll empire of Albion. And nocht content of that
felicite, he thirl^it ye Pichtis our auld co^fiderat freindis, contrar his band
and promise to vile servitude. Nochtheles the end of this alliance schew to the
said Pichtis, quhat damage cummis to be confiderat with treasonabyll pepyll in
contemption of their true freindis. Bot at last ye Pichtis penitent of the
importabyll iniuris done to ws, began (youcht it was to lait) to be prudent,
and brocht ws agane in this realm. And sone after our cummyng we vincust our
feirs ennymes with small difficulte. Now ar their vineust tyrannes returnit to
inuaid ws be advise of Maximiane their capitane. As he wald restore thaym to
their curage, quhylk they tynt before be slauchter of their capitane Castius,
they charge ws (as we war under their dominioun) to pas out of Cu^ber and
Westmureland, quhilkes pertenis to ws be just tytyl. For their reasonis I thynk
we should not only be repugnant to their chargis. Bot als persew our just action
aganis thaym with all pissance. Heir fore be awalknit (vaileant campionis) and
tak our wappinnis with good curage and spreit, thynk na great difficulte occurris
to vincus they febyll creaturis, quhilkes sa cowartly gave place before to our
armoure. Pas forthwart ioly co^paneonis, and have na les memory to our honor,
than to the iniuris done to our ennymes And conques sic glore, that our
posterite be Imitatioun of our dirtew may learn to fecht vaileantlye for their
realm. Als sone as Fergus had said their wourdis, he gave ane sign be sound of
trumpat to June. The tothir two kyngis of Pychtis and Britonis vsit na les
hortatioun to their armyis. Incontinent both the armyis Iunit. At the first
counteryng ye Romany were neir discomfist. For sa huge nowmer of arowis and
ganeis come on thaym, that ye lift mycht skarslie be seen above their heidis.
Maximiane seeing the first bront of Romany in dangeir, send ha^stelie ane
legioun of fresche men in their support. This was the battall renewit and
cruelly fochtin, (...) at last the out wyngis of Ro^^nis be multitude of pepil
ouirset their ennymes fornens thaym. The confiderat pepill and Britonis (that
faucht under Dioneth) maid lang debait. Bot at last the wageouris (ye faucht in
ye vter skirtis of Roman wyngis) come in ye same battall (quhair they were
fechtand) on yair bakkis. The confiderat people (howbeit they were affrayit with
yis suddane terror) ruschit all togidder in ane knot, with stout curage to
fecht to ye deith. The may forcy and strange capitanis of our pepill, rycht
desyrus to revenge their deith (because they saw na other remeid) maid thaym
with may violent force to rusche throw their ennymes, quhair they were all
slane, to the great murdir of their ennymes. Quhill ye Romany were besalye geuyn
to stop this forcy irruptioun of the nobillis forsaid, money of all the remanent
Scottis come feirslie throw their ennymes. And were sauit be ^air flicht. And it
the chais followit fa cruelly be Romany, that few were sauit quhome they mycht
apprehend. Bot at last ye nycht put end to yair laubouris. In this unhappy
battall were slane Fergus king of scottis the.xvi. eir of his regne. And Durstus
king of pichtis with all ye nobilite of both yair realms. Dioneth prince of
Walys evil woundit was brocht to the sea port, nocht far fra ye field, quhair
he gat ane bait. And fled in Walis.

How the Romany vvrocht great iniuris on scottis and Pichtis. How Maximiane
was alliat with Dioneth princ^ of vvalis, and tuk the crown of Britane
co^trar the auctorite of romany. Ca. xi.
EFtir this mischeuous battall, sic terroure raise throw all ye landis of
Scottis and Pychtis, that nocht was traistit bot vte^ exterminioun of both
yair realms. And because they had na esperance of support, their may forcy
campionis beand slane, they thoch^ na thing sa good as to fle in uncouth
realms. Maximiane think and best to use ye present fortoun (as it occurrit)
ceissit fra na manner of cruelte (yt mycht be ^euisit) in Galloway, Annandale,
Mers and Pentland, with sic rage of fire and swerd, yat na estait was sauit fra
his fury. The pepill (yat fled to kirkis and sanctuaryis) were slane but any
sycht to god. The town of Camelon with money other nobill cietris and townis of
Scottis and pichtis were taken, and cassin down to ye ground. This cruelte
ceissit no^ quhil at last ye scottis and pichtis war dreuin schamefully ouir ye
wall yt ryn nis fra Abircorn to du^brito^, and sworn neuir to return beond the
samyn. Ane part of Romany gaif counsall to Maximiane (sen the Scottis and
Pychtis were sa brokin at this time and mycht be haldyn with na pepill in faith
and peace) to distroy thaym all^^etly. Or ellis to banis thaym out of Albion.
Utherwayis na thing mycht be done efferyng to ye common weill of Romany.
Maximiane refusit this counsall, for the wynt was approcheyng. Throw quhilk his
army behuuit to rest in their winter schelis. And because na vittalles were amang
the Scottis and Pychtis to sus^ene his army. And sic vehement cauld in to their
montanis, that na craft mycht withstand ye samyn. For it was for the weil of
their army to abide ye nixt symer. Attoure because Welschemen his nerrast
nychtbouris rebellit aganis him. It was necessar to dant thaym first. In
adventure gyf he persewit ye Scottis and Pychtis leuand behynd him sa perrellus
ennymes, more damage than proffit mycht cum be his weris. For their causis he
returnyt with his victorius army to orke, quhair he remanit all that winter.
And brocht vittallis out of all pertis to sustene ye samyn. At the spring of
the eir he ras^t his tentis, and come with displayit baner aganys Dioneth in
Walis. For he was haldyn king of Britonis fornentis the Ireland seis. And in
the mean time this Maximiane was aduertist be writtingis, yat Bonifacius had
slane two Roman capitanis in Affrik, and yair army discomfist. Throw quhilk
Affrik was wist fra Roman dominioun. And ye said Bonifacius maid king thairof.
Attoure franchemen (quhilk was ye time ane pepil of Almany) was cummyng ouir
Ryne. And entrit in Gallia, quhilk was callit eftir France. with more cruelte
tha^ euir was hard before. And conquest ye landis of Orliance and Paris, and
maid ane king of their a win blude. Throw quhilk it appe^it, that all the
landis callit ye time Gallia, should cum under the dominioun of franchemen.
Maximiane knawyng sa money rebellionis in all pertis aganis Romany, thocht best
to rebel in the samyn wise. And tuke the crown of Britane contrar the Roman
auctorite. And to pecify the realm to him of al debaitis, ya^ he mycht be the
more strange aganis the Romany (gyf they list inuaid him) he tuke the eldest
douchter of Dioneth namit Othilia i^ marriage. For Dioneth gat on king Fergus
sister two douchteris but any mayl childrin. The secu^d douchter namyt Ursula
was maid ane nun, to that fine ye scho should have na succession. Be yis affinite
sic tenderness inccessit betuix Maximiane and Dioneth that ye said Dioneth was
sufferit to haif gretest empire nix^ Maximian in Britane.

Of king Eugenius the secu^d. Of great vassalage done be Maximian i^ britane and
France. How Vrsula and her fallovvi^ war maryit. Ca. xii.
SIc thingis done in Britane, the residew of scotts (quhilkes were eschapit out
of the field before rehersit) conuenit in Argyle. And maid his son Eugenius

realm of Scotland.vii.C.lx. In ye feird eir of Ualentiniane empriour. Eugenius
began the administration of his realm be piete. And tuke the bonis of his
fader fra ye place quhair thai were beryit be Romany. And betyit thaym with
funeral triumph in ye abbay of Colmekil. Fergus was the first king of scottis
yt was beryit in Colmekill. And thairfore it was call lit eftir ye common
sepulture of al scottis kings unto king Macolme Ca^moris dayis. Quhilk biggit
the abbay of Dunfermelyng be perswasioun of sanct Margaret. Quhare money of all
the scottis kyngis been beryit sen syne. King Eugenius rycht desirus to recou^r
ye landis reft fra his fader be Romany and Britonis wrait all the names of his
pepill fra sexte to sextene in ilk town, yt mycht beir armor and wappinnis.
Nochtheles seeing thaym (quhen ^aiwer g^derit) of small nowmer and pissance, he
supersedit his purpos, quhill ane time more ganand. And youcht the scottis and
pychtis were brokin on yis wise, and feblit in yair pyssance. (...) Maximiane
send thaym peace (...) desirit. And because yis Maximiane saw the empire of
romany persewit on al pertis, he set his besynes to have ane pert thairof* and
tuke ye crown of Britane with favor and beniuole^ce of all ye pepyl. Sone
after his coronation he past in Bertane, and left behynd him his good fader
Dioneth with ane legion of pepyl to govern Britane, Fynaly he dantit ye
Bertonaris with sic importabyl affliction, that they were randerit to his
dominion. Than Maximiane tuke be scharp segeing syndry townis, sic as lay on ye
see costis of Bertane. And sone after he come with all his army to ane stra^g
town of bertane namit Redoun, quhilk was kepit be Sulpicius in ye name of
Uale^tiniane empriour. Quhe^ maximiane had seigit yis town la^g time, and micht
get it na way be force of arms, he kest him to inuad ye cuntre, mair be
rubbery, tha^ be honest weir. In ye mean time ye ber taneris gat sic persuasion
be Etius capitane of fr^nc^, yt they rebellit aganis maximiane (...) only
recouerit al thayr strenthis and townis, bot slew al his weirmen quhare they
war ap^hendit. Maximiane mouit be their iniuris, returnit with all his army to ye
said town of Redoun* After money scharp assaltis it was be him taken* and every
pepil found i it but any miseratio^ sla^e or banist ye (...), for he tuk
extreme ire aganis yanie for violation of yair faith. Etius seeing france
ythandly inuadit ^e ye burgu^dianes, send in britane to bring ye legion yt was
left their be maximiane) to support him i^ his weris. This was britane left
nakit of support, and gaif occasion to scottis and pichtis to invade ye
britonis, because they a^aid at ye opinion of maximiane. Finaly quhen yis
maximiane had conquest Berta^e and slane ye may ^t of al ye pepyl yair of, it
yt it (...) not be ane pray to francheme^ their nixt nichtbouris, he brocht ane
gre^ nowme^ of pepyl out of britane to inhabit ye said cu^tre. Su^ authouris
writis their come ane. C.M. men out of britane to inhabit ye la^d of bertane
with Conanus. This Conanus was ane tender friend to Dioneth, and maid king of
bertane, and sa yis land ^ynt ye auld name Ar^^rica, and was callit Bertane fra
their britonis yat come to inhabit ye said land. Tha^ Conanus king of bertane
knawi^g yt every pepyl faileis with in ye age of man (gif they have na
succession) send his ambassatouris i^ britane to have weme^ to be their wiffes.
The ambassatoures (yat come for yis effect) gat consent be the nobyllis of
Britane, yat all the dochteris, sisteres, and antis pertenand in blude to the
brytonis (yat war tha^ in bertane) should pas to yame en haist, togidder with
Ursula the Nun, quhilk was taken out of ye abbay (quhare scho was professed, and
put in ^chip with ye remanent her fallowis, yat the lynage of Dioneth should not
faill, because her other sister Othili^ (quhilk was mari^t on Maximiane before)
was deceissit but any chyldrin. And yocht the passage of their women was
vnplesand to ye Britonis* it it come after to the great felicite of Ursula and
her cu^pany. For quhen they should have passit to Bertane, be tempestious streme
of seis, they war dreuyn with na lytyl dangeir of their lyuis in the mouth of
Ryne, quhare they landit. And because they had sic trubyll be the seis, ^ay tuk
purpos than to pas in Bertane be land. Othires authoures says they tuke their
voyage to Rome be persuasion of this haly Nun Ursula, and war taken be ye
Hu^nis, be quhoin they war al slane, because they would not consent to the
polution of their bodyis. The kirk thairfore syngis eirly dyuyne cerimonyis in
their glore and loving.

How the confiderat kyngis come with great armyis aganis the Britonis. Of
Eugenius orison. Of the great heirschippis maid on Britonis. How Gallio
R^uenna^ was send in support of Britonis. And of his vassalage. Ca. xiii.
EUgenius knawing Brytane be continewal weris destitute of Roman sodiouris
co^uenit with Durstus king of Pichtis to ane counsal. In quhilk after lang
co^sultatio^ was co^cludit, to maik weir aganis the Britonis with sic
providence, y^ na aduertence should be maid thairof. quhyl they war arrait with
in their realms. Sone after ane day was assignit to both their pepyl to
conuene with.xl. dayis vitallis. And vthir necessaris in their best manner. At
the day prefixed come great multitude of pepyll out of all bounds of his realm
to ye wo^ of Calidone. Eugenius seeing his freindis and subdittes gaderit in yis
manner said as fallowis. Nane is ama^g ow (vaileant campionis) that will
degestlie consider both ye materis perten and to ws and our ennymes. Bot he
sall thynk all tarry unprofitable to ws this day. Considering the hie and
Importable iniuris done their money ^eris to ws be roman tyranny. My vaileant
and nobill fader ye recouetar of this realm slane. Above infinite calamiteis
sufferit be ws. e se Carrik, Kyle, Cunnynghame and Galloway with money other
landis of our realm fallin in pray to romany, and youcht ye battall strikin
before be my fadir aganis Maximiane was infortunat to ws. It was nochtheles
rycht vnplesa^d and sorrowful to our ^ays. Forthir the Calamyteis falling be
this battall hes nocht (as I belief) feblit our curage. Bot more enkendil lit
the samyn to revenge ye auld iniuris done sa money eris aganis ws and our
progenitouris, be romany and Britonis. And understand als mekll as our
pissance is minist be roman weris, sa far ar the Romany brokin in yair
pissance be hatrent of fortoun, quhilk inte^des to bring yair empire to nocht.
Throw quhilk tha^ at nocht onl^e odius to all pepil bot als inuadit with cruel
weris. And their prouincys falling to pray of ennymes in all partis. For the
Uandalis hes taken fra thaym all Affrik. The Uisigothis all Spane. The
Franchemen and Burgundianys hes taken ye may part of Gallia now namit France.
The hu^nis hes won Pa^nonia Mysia. Thracia and Macidon. All pepyll (yt is in
the Eist pertis of the world) hes recouerit their lyberte, or ellis randerit
thaym self to ennymes of romany. Rome su^tyme the lady of the world hes been
twys taken be the Gothis, heryit and brint. Forthir the romany ar brocht to sic
calamyte, yt they have na landis nor empire this day* saif only in Italy and
Britane, the quhilk is now nakit of all garnison and weirmen be weris of
Maximiane. Forthir their is na Roman capitane that will or may bring any
support aganis ws. Now is Britane drery and nakit of al support, and sa
disparit, that it sall be erar ane pray than obstakyll to our weris. It nedis
nocht heirfore (vaileant capitanis) to exhort ow to battall, sen knychtly
curage mair abou^^^^^ than faileis in ow. For syckerly ^hair is ane mair huge
pray abydyng ow, than euir was apperyng before de chance of fortoun to any of
our eldaris, Occasioun the mother of all werkis (that are to be done) offeris her
wylfully to ow, persuading all impedimentis and tarry of battall to be set
aside. And exhortis ow to follow her in adventure (gyf e tyne her be our febyll
eurage) e sall nocht wyn her agane, howbeit e wald. Be not mouit (I pray ow) to
ceis fra our honest vassalage for any band yt e haif maid with Maximiane. For
their Romany and Britones hes inuadit ws with money cruel inuris sen ye said
band was maid. And sen our ennymes hes not ceissit to inuaid ws in brekyng of
the said band. How may we do any thing les^ than inuaid thaym on the same
manner. Belt ow thairfore (lusty gallandis) with manheid, and tak our wappinnis
to this honest interpris. Follow (...) spreit and curage of our eldaris, and e
sal nocht ^aile the glore of victory. The army be their word^^ war infla^mit to
battall, and promittit to ieoperd thaym self to al manner of dangeir yat they
mycht revenge the iniuris done to thaym. For the affliction of Romany (quhylk
was richt patent) maid ye remanent wordis of Eugenius to have the mai^ credit.
Than ylk man with schillnoyis bad raise their anseneis, and proceid forthwart.
The Pichtis in ye samyn manner war infla^mit to battal be exhortation of their
king. In continent ye confiderat pepyl inuadit ye Britonis with fire and swerd
in all partis quhare they come. And chasit ye Britonis out of Pentland, Mers,
Berwyk, Galloway, and Annandale. And yairefter they past to Kendale, Cumber,
Westmureland, and ork, and tuke all the munitionis and strenthis of the cuntre.
And quhe^thay had spuleit the townis, they slew al ye cietezanis thairof, and
left na Britonis on live, except thaym that war sauit be flycht. Apperit thus
all Britane to cu^ haistely under the empire of scottis and pichtis. Gif the
samyn war not mair haistely resistit. The britonis impaciet to suffer yir
displeseiris, send their oratouris to ye empriour Ualentiniane, and promittit
their perpetual subjection to him. sa yat he wald support thaym aganis their
unmercifully and cruel ennymes. Ualentiniane ^ycht desyrus to keip britane under
his empire, send ane nobyl capitane namit Gallio ^eue^nas with money legionis of
pepyll in yair support, The scotts and pichtis knawing the cummyng of this new
army, left all the landis in Brytane quhylk war laitly heryit and dystroyit be
thaym, syne returnit hame. For they thocht not profytabyll to ieoperd thaym
aganis ye Romany, knawand be frequent battallis before past their great ma^heid
and cheualry. The Romany at their cumyng in Albion followit be lang chase on
the Scottis to ye watter of Forth, and money of thaym slew be haisty
scharmising. And because their Romany micht not make lang tarry in Albion, for
extreme da^geir appering to france be inuasioun of syndry pepyll, they gart
repare haistely the wall before rehersit betuix Abircorne and Du^britane with
great expensis, and rasit ye samy^ with faill deuat and stanis.xii. cubitis of
hicht, and.viii. cubitis of breid, with money strange touris rising on all sydis.
Their touris and bastaileis war doung togidder with sic thingis (as wald nocht
byrne) to saif the Britonis fra their ennymes. On the hicht of their touris they
set fire pa^nis to aduertis the cuntre, quhen dangeir occurrit. And they that
come not to ye defense heirof (quhen the fire was seen) war punist to the deith.

How ye scottis and pichtis kest down ye wal of Abircorne* and vvrocht great
cruelteis on ye Britonis. Of ye message send be Britonis to Etius* and of his
answer* Ca. xiiii.
BRitane brocht be this manner to roman servitude, Gallio Reuennas returnit in
France, ^uhais departing gaif occasion to the confiderat kyngis, to inuaid the
Brytonis with mair cruelte than before. Than king Eugenius assemblit all his
pepyll before him, and sumtyme infla^mit thaym with huge Ire aganis ^hair
ennymes. And sumtymes prouokit thaym be esperance of pray and riches to be
gottin on their ennymes. And the king of Pichtis ceissit not to exhort his
pepyll on the same manner, and promittit be publik edict to geif yt capitanry of
Camelon to him that first past ouir this wall of Abircorn. The Britonis knawyng
weill the assemblance of scottis and pichtis, come arrayit in their best manner
to defend this wall before rehersit, and put ane great nowmer of weirmen in the
bastaileis and touris thairof to resyst the inuasioun of ennymes. Aganis quhom
was send the vaileant Grahame with ane cumpany of scottis and pichtis armyt
with corsbowis slonges and handbowis. Als sone as this Grahame had doung the
Brytonis fra this wall. Incontinent come masonnis, wrychtis, and money otheris
craftisme^ with syndry instrumentis, and kest down the dyke unto ye ground. Ane
great ^a^d of britonis maid yame to withstand ye euersyon of this wall, bot they
be obstinate fechtyng war all slane. Otheris (that knew ye cruel furye of
confiderat pepyll) gaif bakkis, confiding in na thing mair than in their
flycht. Quhill sic thingis war done at ye wall of Abircorn, their come ane other
cumpany of pichtis out of Fiffe in Peatland, and did mair cruelteis to the
Brytonis (quhare they come) tha^ did their scottis and pichtis that come before
thaym. Als sone as both their cumpanyis war assemblit togydder, nocht was (but
fire and slauchter) quhare they come. The inhabytantis affrayit be their
cruelteis, fled with their wiffis, barnis, and guddis beond the watter of Tyne.
Incontinent all gudis betuix Tweid and Tyne be general proclamation of ye two
kyngis war denuncit freely eschetit and pray to their army. Followit money
schamefull and abominable deeds be persuasion of Ire, hatrent, and avarice.
The skry and terrible noyis arrayis be furye of weirmen, ceissyng fra na manner
of cruelte, throw all ye landis betuix ye Ireland seis on the ta said, and y^
Almane seis on the tothir. The Britonis for feir of their importable terrouris
reparit the wall of Adriane with huge lauboure and expensis. The confiderat
pepil knawyng (because the winter was approcheyng) their army mycht nocht abide
togidder, ceissit fra seging of ye said wall. And sat down with their wyffis and
children in all the landis that were conquest at this time be richt of battall.
The Britonis dreidand ye scottis and Pichtis at the cumyng of ye (...) Ueir to
inuaid yame with more (...) than before, send their ambassa^ouris to Etius,
quhilk was capitane of France (as said is) and desyrit support aganis the
confiderat pepill. Alwayis yis Etius send na support to ye britonis, vncertane
quhidder he wald send nane (because he fauorit nocht the emprioure Ualentiniane)
as he that purposit to usurp the crown of France. Or gyf he mycht nocht make
support to ye said britonis for feir of the scharp battall that his ennymes had
aganis him.

How Conanus prince of vvalis exhortit the Britonis to tak peace with scottis
and pichtis. and was slane. How ye Britonis after his slauchter faucht amang
thaym self. Ca. xv.
NOw were the oratouris of britonis returnit with this repulse of Etius in
Britane, followit syndry consultationis amange their Britonis. Sum gaif counsall
to inuaid the Scottis and Pychtis als weil be see as land. And to defend their
liberte (quhilk was laitlie recouerit) to the deith. And nocht only to bring
men, bot all fensabill women for defense of their realm, and to conuene with
all deligence at the wall of Adriane. And erar to ieoperd thaym to extreme
daungeir than to suffer sa continual heirschippis and slauchter, or to tak
peace (howbeit it were necessar) with any inhonest conditionis. In the mean time
Conanus prince of Walis discending be lang progressioun of ye native kyngis of
Britane, said to the Britonis in this manner. It is necessar to all pepill (wise
faderis) gyf they intend other to make co^ques, or to keip yair awin rowmis fra
iniure of fayis, to have respect both to their pyssance and the season (as
occurris) for ye time. Sa lang (suthlie) as we were supportit be Romany and were
sufficient to defend this realm aganis our unmerciful fayis, we socht na peace
with ye treasonable Scottis and Pychtis. Bo^ now (allace) our realm abidis
ane other chance. For we are attenuat and brokin be tyranny of ye proud
Maximiane. Quhilk hes been more noysum to ws, tha^ any ennymes mycht haif been
quhen he be avarice socht the empire of the world. And we are sa waistit be the
same, that we may haif na confidence of victory, gyf we fecht be our awin
pissance. Now we have na esperance be support of Romany, and sen we are
insufficie^t be our awin power to resist our ennymes i^ times cu^yng, how may
we plesa^dly debait in sic perrellus auenture^ yir cruel tyrannys our ennymes
nocht brokin with lang we^es, laubour nor distres, hes nothir dreid of god, man
nor of deith to be reuengit of the iniuri^ done to thaym sa money eris before be
ws. Amang thaym is na deference of age nor of kind man and wife equale, rageand
in battall but any mercy. Their cheualry is nocht bot wod fury. For they reiose
in na thing sa mekill as in murdir of agit men and barnis, and siclik febill
personnis, with sic insaciable thrift that they eschame nocht to drynk ye blud
of yair ennymes. And delitis i^ nocht bot in thift and slaucht. Thairfore we
mon other have peace with yame or ellis suffer at their will ma importable
cruelteis yan before. And yocht peace be rycht schamefull to ws, it better is to
have patience for ane time, than to lois our realm and liberte with more
schame. I say their wourdis for na desire of conques or honouris, bot only for
ye singular affection yt I beir unto our common weill. Auyse thairfore
quhidder the samyn be mair fruitful or noysum thairto. The Britonis war rycht
co^mouit that Conanus persuadit yame to peace. And said they wald have na amite

ALs sone as ye fame was brocht to London, that the Scottis and Pychtis had
maid cruel incursionis in ye landis of britonis, ane huge feir and terror
went throw all ye ciete. And quhen the Britonis were takand their consultatioun
(youht it was in vane) how they should dres al materis, come the vaileant Grahame
with ane cumpany of chosyn men to the wall of Abircorne. And brak down the same
in all partis so halelie, that he left na thing thairof standing more than
remanis now in their dayis. And for that cause yis wall was callit eft Grahamis
dike. Sic tyngis done Grahame went to the wall of Adriane fornens the Ireland

the scottis and pychtis should be condignely punist for their attemptatis.

How the Britonis war vincust and maid tributar to Scottis and Pychtis* and
of the conditionis of peace geuyn to the said Britonis. Ca. xvii.
IN the mean time quhen this answer come fra Etius, ye ambassatouris returnit
fra the Scottis and Pychtis. And schew that ye petitionis of Brytonis war na
thing plesand to the said Scottis and Pychtis. For they wald not ceis fra
ythand slauchter and heirschip of Brytonis, quhill other their realm was
conquest, or ellis freely randerit to thaym. The Britonis war richt affrayit be
their wourdis, nochtheles they enforcit thaim self to curage, and ruschit
haistely to harnes, detes^yng their effeminate sleuth. Be quhilk they gaif
audacite to their ennymes, and tynt ye victory be their cowartry that they

aduertist yat ye Britonis war repulsit be Etius of their desiris, gaderit their

aganis yair e^nymes. The Britonis i^ ye samyn manner war aduertist be the

extreme Ire on the ta side, and disperation on ye tothir side, yai maid yame
all with ane consent to battal. Incontinent be blast of trumpat both the

to revenge their deith, and ^o^de for defense of yair realm, set on yair

(quhilkes faucht i^ ye first battal) war neir discomfist. Graham ye ^aileant
capitane seand his freindis in extreme dangeir, send ane great cumpany of Ilis
men fra ye carage in their support. Incontinent ye scottis and pichtis (that
war before wou^dit and discomfist) renewit battal, Than ye Britonis ouirset with
multitude of ennymes ruschyng upon thaym on all sydis, and disparit of victory
fled to ane mos nocht far fra the field. The carriage men seeing ye battal
disco^fist left their carriage, and slew their ennymes heir and their quhare
they war taken ouirset in ye mossis. In this battall war slane.iiii.M. scottis,
and of Britonis.xv.M. The princes and nobillis of Britane war sa halely slane
in this battall, yt the residew of Brytonis mycht make na defense for yair

victorius kyngis humely desyring peace under quhat conditioun they plesit. The
confiderat kyngis na les mouit be the sorrowful chance falling to Britonis,
than with ye present calamyte falling to thaym self, co^discendit to have peace
under their conditionis. The Brytonis in times cumyng sall ressaue na Roman
capitane with armyis above thaym in Britane. And sall suffer na ^omanis,

the cumyng of Saxonis in Albioun (quhilk I intend now to schawe) is richt

Paulus Diaconus, Beda Ueremundus with other mair recent and expert
hystoricianis) concordis with this Galfrede nouthir in the narratioun of the
hystorye, nor it in the dait of eris. We think thairfore it is mair sowndand to
the verite to follow money prouyn and attentyk authouris in discriptioun of our

of eris, than to follow the said Galfrede writand but any testimoni all of

Of money nobyll clerkis and sanctis in sindry partis of the vvarld. and of
syndry prodigies and meruellis seen in Albion. and of Fy^^akco^^e. Ca. xviii.
Money nobyl me^ war in their days. As Anselmus, Philippus Hilarious. Amang ws were
i^ they days Palladius, quhylk was send be Celestine pape to confound ye heresy
of Pelagius risyn than in syndry partis of Albion. This Palladius was the first
byschop that bure authorite amang the Scottis and was creat be ye pape. The
byschoppis before him war creat be votis allanerlye of the monkis and preistes
namyt Culdeis. This Palladius purgit ye Scottis and Pichtis of money vane
superstitionis and ritis of gentilis vsit in they dayis. And thairfore he was
callit ye apostyll of Scottis, and deceissit in ane town of Mernes namit
Fordoun, quhare his blissit body restis it haldin in great veneration amang ye
pepyll. His banis war laitly translatit be ane nobyl man William Scheues
archebischop of sanct Andros, and put in ane silver cais with money solemn
cerimonyis. Fra ye incarnation of god ane.M.iiii.C.lxxxxiiii. eris. This
Palladius maid sanct Serf bischop, and send him in Orknay to instruck the rude
pepyll thairof in ye faith. Als he gaif the sacrament of baptem to Teruanus,
and maid him archebischop of Pichtis. About this time was send fra pape
Celestyne sanct Patrik in Ireland to defend ye samyn fra heresy of pelagius.
Throw quhilk the crystyn faith began to incres in Ireland and Albion. Money
meruellis war seen in syndry partis of Albion, before the Britonis faucht aganis
the Scottis and Pichtis. The moon beand i^ opposition (quhe^ it is may round)
apperit suddanly as it war four nukit. In ork war money schouris of blude. The
branchis and leuis of treis war strokyn with thonder and wederit in money partis
of Albioun. The merkat gait of London raif with ane huge gaip, and money housis
beside sank. The pepyl preichit their signis to cum in damage of ye Britonis.
Nochtheles the same was mesit be ye preistis quhilk co^mandit na credence to be
geuyn to sic fantasyis. It is said that Fynmakcoule the son of Coelus scottis
man was in their days ane man of huge statoure of.xvii. cubitis of hycht. He was
ane great huntar and rycht terrybyll for his huge quantite to the pepyll. Of
quhome ar money vulgar fabyllis amang ws nocht unlike to their fabyllis that are
rehersit of king Arthure. And because his dedis is nocht authorist be autentik

king Eugenius and other nobyllis. And sa endis heir the seuynt Buke of their
Cronyklis.

Heir begynnis the aucht Buke of the croniklis of Scotland:
How money Roman provinces fell in pray to syndry pepyll, and how syndry
realmis began thairthrovv. Ca. Primo.
QUhen Britane westane in this manner fra the empire of romany, and maid
tributar to Scottis and Pychtis. The Uandalis, Gothis, Hunnis, and franche men
maid great slauchter in Spane Affrik, Italy, Almany, and France. Throw quhilk
apperit the manifest declinatioun of Roman empire in sindry realms, as ye
variant chance of fortoun succedis. For the franche men (quhais beginning is
vncertane) come ouir the river of Ryne And past throw ane great part of gallia*
quhilk was eftir callit France be their franchemen. And eftir yat they had taken
Orliance and Paris they sat down beside the reueir of Sane, (...) they chesit
Ueremond to be king. And maid the first foundeme^t of y^ nobil realm of
France. Throw quhilk it was co^mandit that all the landis lyand betuix the
mouth of Ryne and the hillis of Pirrony, deuidyng France fra Spane on the ta
side. And fra ye montanis of Sauoy to the occ^^ne seis on the tothir side, should
be callit France. About yis same time Genferik began the realm of Ua^dalis in
Affrik. And was the first king that rang above the pepill. Quhais posterite had
na better chance in the end, than in the beginning of their empire. For as yai
began with tyranny and slauchter of innocent pepill, siclike they were inuadit
both with extern weris and civil battall, and fynaly brocht to ane myserabyll
end. The visigothis and astrogothis (ane pepyll borne in perdition of romany)
began to regne this same time in Italy and Spane. And in this time began the
Hu^nis to regne in Pa^nonia, and because they grew under ane blude with the auld
inhabitantis of ye cu^tre, callit Garis, ye cuntre was callit Ungaria. Money
vthir infinite cumpanyis of barbar pepyll went throw the world yat time
persewand Romany with all malice. Throw quhilk it hapnit yat na man mycht
trauall in they dayis but extreme dangeir of yair life. For quhen passingeris
war inqirit, quhat yai war? gif they answerit they war freindis of ye senate and
pepyl of Rome. The demandaris said they war ennymes, and for yt cause yai war
spuleit of yair geir or lyuis. Siclike gif yai answerit they war ennymes to
Romany, the demandaris wald allege thaym freindis, and sa they war spuleit and
slane in ye samyn manner. Sic thyngis maid the Gallis (quhylkis war ye auld
inhabitantis of France) astonist to intercommon with romany and Franchemen.
The britonis (quhilkis war laitly syttyn down in Bertane) knawyng this trubyll
be ye roman weris sufferit na uncouth blude to cum within thaym, for they knew
nocht quhay was freindis or fayis.

How Conanus exhortit the Britonis to recover their liberte. Of the message
send be scottis and pichtis to Britonis. And how the noblis and commonis of
Britane inuadit other be battall. Ca. ii.
THe nobyllis of Brytane brokyn with frequent weris. and seeing na pepyll but
trubyl, held thaym in quiet certane eris. Paying justly their trybute to the
victorius and confiderat kyngis. And sa past.x. eris or euir ye Britonis began
any rebellioun aganis Scottis and Pichtis. In the mean time raise new trubyll in
Kent. For Conanus son of Conanus (quhilk was slane before as we schew)
conuenit syndry nobyllis of Brytane be secret messingeres to ane counsal
within ane wod, and said in this manner. e se now (wise freindis) how our pepyll
sumtyme sa pissant and vaileant in deidis of cheualry, and haldyn in reverence
to all pepyl is now maid tributar to Scottis and pichtis with infinite
calamiteis daily wrocht on ws. Quhat may be (allace) the cause of this
afflictioun? nocht bot our awin sleuth, be quhilk we have faileit sa far to our
self, and brokyn be the gyle of Maximiane, yat we (as may febyl creaturis)
hes taken the ok upon our nek. We may sone consider how far we been degenerit
fra the curage of our nobyl eldaris, quhilkis sumtyme dang ye Scottis out of
Albion. And youcht in yis last unhappy battal strikin be ws.x. eris ago aganis
scottis and pichtis we war constranit for the huge slauchter of our nobyllis
to seik peace mair necessar yan honest. it now ye tyrane Maximiane is put down,
and our pissance co^ualescit. For now ar rissyn in Britane money rank and forcy
oung men reddy for all laubour and ieoperdes. Quhais vnbridillit insolence salbe
mair noysum to ws, than any cruelte of ennymes. Gif we suffer ye samyn to dull
in sleuth, we have plente of riches and strenth, and na thing laikis, bot
curage both to vincus our ennymes and to deliver ws of barbar servitude.
Remember thairfore (vaileant campionis) ye illuster dedis of our eldaris.
Deuoyd ow of sleuth, and belt ow with good hoip, gladness, and virtew. For sic
thingis ar ye souerest way to bring our materis to good fine, that e may
resembyll the anciant excellence of our progenitouris in sic wise, ye nocht
only our e^nymes bot al other pepyl may understand that e ar mair geuyn to
virtew and glore of battall, than to any feir of deith. The nobyllis of britane
be their wourdis war drawin in sindry opinionis. Su^ of thaim with furius vult
and continence desyrit nocht bot battal. Otheris mair prudent dred (gif they
mouit weir in yis sort) that yair sonnis (quhilkis lay in hoistage) should be
slane, and wald nocht consent thairfore to battall. Fynaly quhen they had put
of the day with money altercationis, they seuerit on ylk side but any effect of
their purpos. Nocht lang after the confiderat kyngis were aduertist of their
consultationis maid amang ye Britonis, and began to punis their plegis with
syndry afflictionis, and maid their ordinance to invade the Britonis as
brekaris of their faith and promys. it before they rasit yair army, they send
ambassatouris to Britonis to espy the myndis of their nobyllis, and co^monis.
Their ambassatouris at their cumyng i^ Britane schew yame send fra the victorius
and confiderat kyngis to exhort the Britonis to perseueir in the band before be
their faith and promis. And prayit thaym to geif na credit to thaim, yt
persuadit yame be vane reasonis to rebellyon, in adventure (gif they sa did)
they laborit mair in their awin damage than proffit. Attoure they brocht
certane chargis fra the confiderat kyngis to the said Britonis with
certification (gif ye samyn war nocht obeyit) they sall be inuadit with mair
awful battall than before. The chargis war, that the Brytonis sall hald na
publik counsal nor parliament amang thaym in times cumyng but advise of ye
confiderat kyngis, and they sal keip the auld conditionis of peace in all
poyntis as it was before contrackit. And they sal ressaue agane their auld
plegis and deliver doubyl als money new plegis for ye samyn. The Britonis greuit
with their importabyll chargis, thocht first extreme chance of battal erar to be
assaileit, than sa schameful conditionis of peace to be obseruit. And thairfore
they had ruschit all of ane mind with may cruelte to harnes, war nocht their
noyis and din of armoure was haistely mesit be ye nobyllis. The co^monis brokyn
of their purpos in this wise, maid ane lamentabyl regrait ama^g thaym self of
the febyll cowarty of their nobillis. Throw quhilk their common weil was put to
great affliction. Nocht lang after followit ama^g thaym ane mair sorrowful
contention than before. For the co^monis im^^^cient to suffer uncouth servitude,
^^schit to harnes, and be plane rebellyon thocht to distroy all ye nobyllis of
Britane, because they war degenerit fra the virtew of their eldaris, and
thirllit thaym to ye empire of barbar pepyll. This pley was fynaly discussit be
the swerd, for the co^monis rageand in may fury faucht aganis the nobyllis
with mair hatrent than ordour of cheualry, and war discomfist with incredibyll
slauchter. This cruelte of co^monis was nocht dan^it be this bergan. For sone
eft they ruschit agane till harnes, and faucht aganis their nobyllis with lytyl
better fortoun tha^ before. Throw quhilk their pyssance was sa brokyn, that they
durst not remane in their awin housis bot fled with their wyffis and chyldrin
to the montanis, and maid frequent heirschippis on the noblis. It last they war
constranit on athir sydis to have peace. For the nobillis micht not leif but
industry of co^monis, nor the co^monis but ye authorite and prudence of
nobyllis. Their civil weris hurt ye realm of britane with na les damage than
did the tyranny of Maximiane before quhen he maid it nakit both of weirmen and
pepyll.

Of syndry afflictionis and plagis quhilkis fell on the Britonis for their
iniquite and corruppit life. Of the deith of king Eugenius. Ca. iii.
FOllowit be their cyuyl battallis great mortalyte and hungir. and co^tinewit
three eris togidder amang ye Britonis. Than followit incredybyl plente with mair
habu^dance and fouth than was euir rememberit in any time before. Throw quhylk
raise uncouth lust the pomp of all myscheif amang ye pepyl. Every ane of thaym
geuyn mair till riatus surfeit and glutony of yair wambe, than to any virtew of
their eldaris. Throw quhilk they become of sa vicious and sa corruppit life,
that na pepyll of good maneris mycht leif amang thaym. And nocht only (as sanct
Bid testifijs) war ye temporal estait drownit in their vicis, bot the
spretuall estait in the samyn manner. This terrybyll pest of glutony hurt the
Brytonis mair in yair virtew, guddis, and glore of armies, than euir did any
swerd before. And schortly (as the reward of glutony is) their come on thaym sa
huge mortalyte, that the quyk was skarsly sufficient to bury the deid. And
youcht they war may cruelly punist in this wise, nothir the feir of deith nor
p^sent calamite micht draw thaym fra their inhansit sin. And thairfore their
vicis (in quhylkis they war drownit sa myserably) was occasyoun, that they war
after conquest be the Saxonis. And tynt both their ryall majesty and crown
with sic displesoure, that they micht neuir recover agane yair anciant
honouris. Quhill Brytane was in sic trubyll, the scottis and pichtis were in good
peace, geuand their attendance after sa lang weris to decore thaym self in
riches, faith, and honest institutionis, And gaif thankis to god yat causit
thaym perseueir in good felicite, and yair ennymes in sic displeseir be just
punytioun of their demeritis, that they micht nothir defend thaym self, nor
invade their nychtbouris. And thairfore traistit all the landis betuix Humber
and the Franche seis to cum haistely under their perpetual dominioun. King
Eugenius hauand na weris nor ennymes in this manner, brocht his realm to mair
honor tha^ ever it had before. And deceissit ye.xxx. eir of his regne. Quhilk

And how they send ambassatouris to Androenus king of Bertane for support

EUgenius deceissit on this manner but any airs of his body, his brothir
Dongard was maid king. This Do^gard was nocht far dyfferent fra the maneris of
his brothir Eugenius, richt desyrus of peace* and nocht detestyng weir quhen it
was necessar. And because he had na occasion of weris, he send prudent men in
syndry partis of his realm to minister Justice, and reparit all faileit
castellis and strenthis of his realm quhare they war ruinus or decayit, that
the samyn micht be reddy aganis quhat sumeuer chance that mycht fall, knawyng
weill al realms and pepyll sa thirllit to mutabilite of fortoun, that they
mycht nocht perseueir lang time in quiet. Attoure because peace engeneris
riches, and riches engeneres insolence* and insolence geuys occasion of
battall. He began to have the great felicite succeding to his empire in
suspicion, traisting na thing mair surely than battall succeding after sa lang
peace. And thairfore he garnyst all ye munitionis of the bordouris with may
weirly ordinance in na les dylygence than the weir war instantly appering. Sic
thyngis done he dotat ye kirkis of Palladius and otheris his colleigis with
money rich la^dis and rentis to the sustentation of deuyne service. And
co^mandit the kirkis and sanctuaris of his realm to be sicker refuge to all
crimynal personis during their resydence in the samyn, Nocht withstandyng quhat
sumeuer offense of lose majesty committit be thaym. Attoure he dotat ye kirkis
with otheris priuilegis and eikit thaym be his ryall magnificence with mair
ampyll boundis than they war before. Quhill sic thyngis war done in Scotland, ye
Britonis lamentit their sorrowful chance, seand thaym self trybutar to the
last pepyll of the world, and sa thirllit to seruytude that they nothir durst
nor it mycht resaue strangearis amang thaym to rich thaym be sic chance of
marchandyce as their eldaris did before. And above their calamyteis they war
punyst for their wickit sin, with swerd, hunger, and deith. After money
sorrowful afflictionis they maid general processionis in all partis of their
realm, and prayit merciful god to deliver thaym of al trubyl and plaigis
falling on yame for their iniquite, that they micht recover their anciant fame
and honors. Fynaly their Britonis war sa penitent that they maid yair solemn
votis all atanis to amend their lyuis and desist fra their synnis, for
delyueryng of thaym fra iniure and servitude of ennymes. Than Conanus (quhylk
maid ye oriso^ before to Britonis) traisting to have oportunite to move ye
nobyllis to recover their honor and liberte said in this manner. Had my wordis
said in our last counsall mouit our myndis (wise Brytonis) to battall contrar
our dispitfull ennymes, it had nocht been necessar this day to make this orison.
For e micht nocht only have doung our ennymes out of al bou^dis of our realm,
(...) als mycht have had both our realm extendit to ye auld marchis, and our
pepyll dwelling under natyue kyngis of Britane but any iniuris of ennymes. Now
e ar brokin be swerd, hunger, and pest, with money other calamyteis* and hes now
good experience quhat myscheif, vengeance, and sorrow fallis to mortal pepyl be
corruppit lust, nocht haua^d god nor his institutionis in reverence. our
pissance in times bygane was mair ampyll and strange than now. Howbeit our
myndis war nocht geuyn than (as the deid schew) to regard quhat precius
treasoure is lyberte. Nor it quhat honor was to recover our realm. Bot now
be aduer^ fortoun e be mair prudent, and hes recouerit our curage to attempt
sic thyngis as been may expedient for our common weill. For now ye desire of
our anciant honouris and lyberte enforcis ou to assa^^e for our co^moun weill
the chance of fortoun. And will we degeistly ponder this matter, we sall know
our ennymes incressyng awful and ylk day mair repugnant to our weil. I se
yairfore na thing that may seem ws les, than to ouirpas our dayis in miserabyll
sleuth, of quhilk ye end is nocht bot schame. And sen we but reason ar geuyn to
riatus and vicius leuyng (be quhilk al vengeance sproutes in displesour of man)
lat ws return to god the fontane of mercy and grace, and pray him to put ane
end to our afflictioun. For as be his wraith all realms faileis, sa be his
favor and mercy all pepyl conualescis, quhen they ar penytent. And sen we have
sufferit great punytyoun iustlye deseruit for our iniquite. Lat ws have sicker
confydence in god to pardoun our offencis be his mercy, changeand our drery
life in better fortoun. The time sall wyrk all thingis weil gyf we meis the Ire
of god, for he repellis nane that seikis to him. Quhat is he that euir sufferit
any aduersyte of forton fechtand in just battall? bot gyf it cum throw his
folly. Thairfore gif we be worthy to be callit the posterite of they vaileant
campionis (quhylkis vincust sa often the Scottis and Pychtis). Lat ws assail.
how we may best recover our landis, and revenge the cruelteis done sa money eres
to ws, with sycker confidence of vyctory. Sen fortoun is changit be our
curage, and our ennymes dullyt be lang sleuth. And may of all that we are to
fecht in just battall, aganis our peruerst ennymes. This orison of Conanus
mouit sa the pepyl, that they had run haistely to harnes, were nocht syndry
prudent men schew be euydent signs, they war nocht of sic pyssance for the
time that they may withstand their ennymes without they had support of other
cuntreis. Thus was it co^cludit to send ambassatouris to Androene king of
Bertane, quhilk was bot fourt persoun fra Conane the first king of ye blude* to
schaw him the intollerabil iniuris done to thaym be Scottis and Pychtis, and to
desire support aganis thaym to recover their landis. Nocht lang after Conanus
and Guytellyne byschop of London were send (as ambassatoures) to Androene king
of Bertane for support of Britonis aganis the confiderat pepyll.

Of the deith of Conanus* and of the orison maid be Guytellyne to the king of
Bertane How Constantyne his son was send with ane army in Britane. and maid
king thairof. Ca. v.
QUhen Conanus and Guytellyne war departit on this manner to pas to the king of
Bertane. This Conanus be corruppit air of seis fell in ane fever, and
deceissit betuix Britane and Bertane. Guytellyne rycht sorrowful of his deith,
arryuit i^ Bertane and burijt him with funeral triumph. Syne past with the
resydew of his cumpany to king Androene in Bertane, and said to him in this
manner. Were the cause of my cumyng and quhat I am unknown to the (may
inuincibyll prince) it had been necessar to begin my orison in ane other manner,
yt I mycht be ye samyn have drawin the in mair favor and compassion of our
trubyll. Bot sen I know sic thyngis ar rycht patent before thy sycht, I will
declare the effect of my message at schort wordis. The scottis and pichtis
may cruel pepyl in erd (quhen they knew ws nakit of weirmen and Roman
soudiouris) inuadit ws and our realm with sic cruelteis of swerd and fire,
that they put ws out of all boundis lyand betuix ye wall of Abircorne and Tyne.
And it nocht saciat be their attemptatis* they brak down ye wall of Adryane, and
come with sic rageand fury aganis our pepyll, yat they semyt to subdew all
Brytane to their dominion. And fynaly they had subdewit the samyn without
recouir, gif yai had possedit sufficient nowmer of pepyl, als weil to inhabit
the land, as to co^ques the samyn. Quhen our pepyll war brokyn with their and
money other skaithis, and couth find na support of Romany, they concludit erar
to ieoperde thaym self to may da^geir, tha^ daily to leif in sic displeseir.
And sone after (as forcy and vnabasit ca^pionis) they come aganis their e^nymes
with delyuerit mind other to deliver thaym of sic insufferabyll displesouris,
or than all atanis to de. After syndry chancis of battall we war fynaly
vincust, our strangest capitanis taken or ellis slane* our ennymes after this
vyctory mair insolent tha^ before, and desyryng na les to deuore our blude, than
to conques our realm, wrocht on ws ylk day mair dispitfull cruelteis. Quhyll
at last we war sa brokyn in our substance and strenth, that we war constranit
to have peace with thaym mair necessar than proffitabyl, and co^stranit be ye
samyn to gif ye noblis sonnis of our realm in plege for the obseruyng of al
pointis after the tenor of ye peace with yame contrackit. At last our pepil
thirllit ilk day with new and intolerable opp^ssion, war penitent of yir
co^ditionis of peace succedi^g (as apperit) in euersion of their common weill.
Throw quhilk raise ane odius contention betuix the nobillis and commonis, quhilk
was nocht endit but huge murdir on all sydis. After this slauchter followit
great derth and pouerte amang ws. Bot than succedit plente ye mother of
insolence, quhilk was mair scaithfull to ws than was ye hunger before precedent.
For throw this huge plente was generit ane terribyll pest with greter mortalyte
of pepyll than euir was remembrit before in Britane. it all their calamyteis and
trubyll put nocht ws to sic afflictioun, as did the furius cruelte of Scottis
and Pichtis, be quhome new extorsionis at daily deuysit on ws. New plegis
commandit to be geuyn, and new tribute sa surfetly taken that our guddis ar
confiscat, and (...) bodyis pynit. And schortly we find na securite of life,
quhare our ennymes hes dominioun. Their grievous and intollerabyl displesouris na
les sorrowful to the inuyncybyll prince, than to ws may nocht be schawin but
indignatioun. Fynaly we war sa brokin thairwith, that we war constranit to know
god, seeing that we be his just punition war fallyn in sa money calamyteis for
our wekit offense. Thus we determit with delyuerit mind (sa far as may be done
be ingyne of man) to amend all offencis, that we have done both to god and
man. Traistyng (fra we have pecifyit the Ire of god) yt every thing sall
succeed as we desire. For their motiuis (may inuyncibil prince) we have taken
purpos to deliver ws of seruytude, and to recover our realm and honouris. it
because we are brokyn sa money eris in our pyssance and strenth, we may not
attempt sic materis* And at cu^myn thairfore humly praying the to have
compassioun on this sorrowful chance falling to ws thy progenitou^is* quhilkis
ar put to sic punytioun, that we may make na defense aganis our vndantit fais,
les tha^ thou support ws with their thy vaileant pepyll, quhilkes beand gra^tit,
we sal deliver ws schortly of all dishonor falling to ws their syndry eris be
our awin defalt, for nane is bot thou that dar oppone thaym aganis the
cruelteis of Scottis and Pychtis. Understand heirfore thou sall nocht defend
uncouth housis bot only the felicite of thy awin realm, quhais crown is
natyue to the. For youcht the empire of Brytonis was sumtyme deuydit in two
realms Britane and Bertane, now remanis nane on live sa neir of blude (as
thou) to succeed to thaym both. Contempne nocht this occasion sa plesandly
offerit to the. Support this matter, for it pertenis na les to thy self than to
ws. Thou may regne and have empire of both the realms with good felicite. King
Androene answerit, that he was na les sorrowful for the calamyteis falling to
ye Britonis, than to him self. Nochtheles the chance of the world is sa, that
mortal pepyll ar oftymes deieckit fra hie felicite i^ supreme misery. And fra
supreme misirie exaltit agane in may prosperity. For nature hes subd^^it men
to sic lawis, that their estait is nocht but mortal. and sumtyme hes experience
of good fortoun sumtyme of evil. And forthir he thocht the Britonis war worthy
to be louit, because they had na les curage in their aduersite, tha^ fortoun was
respo^dent to yair desir^s. As to his cummyng in Britane, he schew him sa agit,
yt he mycht nocht sustene ye charge of weris. Nochtheles he should send his son
Constantine, ane oung and vaileant prince with all the power yat he mycht
provide in Britane to support thaym aganis the Scottis and Pychtis. And quhen
he had promittit this support he causit bischop Gwytelline to pas to the town
of Redone to make his residence quhill the army were reddy to pas with him.
Incontinent king Androene co^mandit all the schippis of his land to cum at ane
p^fixit day in ye port of sanct Maclouius, with their patronis and marineris in
their best auyse. Als sone as all thyngis were dewlie prouidit, Constantine
pullit up salis. And finali^ arriuit in Britane. Quhair he was ressauit with
incredible triumph and Joy. For the pepill traistit be his great manheid and
prudence, to recover their realm and liberte. Nocht lang eftir ane counsall
was maid be the nobillis of Britane. In the quhilk Constantyne was maid king,
and sworn to fecht for ye common weil of his realm to the deith.

How Dongard king of Scottis come with great power aganis Constantyne king of
Britonis. Of his orison to his army. How he was slane and the Britonis
discomfist. Ca. vi.
COnstantyne king of Britonis sone eftir his coronatioun, co^mandit be general
edict all sensabil personis to co^uene ye.xl. day eftir at Hu^ber prouidit in
their best auyse to obey ye command of yair capitane. The pepill had sic ardent
desire to recover their liberte, that few was absent at the prefixit day al
inflammit at^nis with sic curage, strenth and pissance, that they semit
alluterly to distroy the Scottis. Als sone as king Dongard was aduertist of
this rebellioun of Britonis, he co^mandit all their pledgis to be slane, and
with may deligence assemblit ane army out of all boundis under hes empire,
and come to ork. Quhair he with spreit na thing affrayit abaid the cumyng of
Britonis. On the morrow knawyng be his spyis that his ennymes were within four
mylis he rasit his tentis and come haistelie in his ennymes sycht. Quhilkis were
liand nocht far fra the montanis of Humber. On the nixt morrow Dongard went to
ane hie mote and said to his army as followis. It should be na admiration to ow
(good co^paneonis) youcht Britonis have left ye feildis (quhair they should have
fouchtin) and fled to ye montanis of Humber. For they been of sa febill ingyne
and nature, yat howbeit thai make great bost and mannassyng (as they were may
vaileant aganis their ennymes) it their spreit and curage sone dekeyis Quhen
they se their ennymes in sycht that dantit thaym before. Now e have experience,
how facill the Britonis been to move new trubill, so full of wyndis and vane
behechtis. And now e know how soft they ar to execute their interprisis. They
come on ws yis last day with schynand armor and wappynnis, desyring battall.
As they were haistelie to inuaid ws. Criand with frequent vocis, quhen sall our
ennymes cum? quhare ar they fled now? quhare ar they hyde bot now this ar dent
desire of battall is foret. For they ar fled to the montanis, discomfist be our
only sycht. Nochtheles gyf they retourn to gyf ow battal. Traist nocht bot
sicker victory. For e ar to fecht aganis falls and treasonabil pepil, brekaris
of their faith and band. And youcht their pissance be sum part ekit now, it
their curage is na mair ereckit than before. Belief e that Constantyne (quhylk
is brocht out of ane uncouth realm, and now maid king of Brytonis) may quickin
the curage or spreit of thaym that are geuyn only to bordellis, sensualiteis,
or surfeit nurysyng of their wambe, and accustomat before ye iunyng of battallis
to fle. Or belief e yt yat may resist ow quhom they have found sa often
victorious. Traist fermely (good companeonis) the houndis ar nocht sa dreidfull
to the haris, nor the wolffis to ye schip as our visage is to thaym. Be noc^t a
^asit for their arrowis, dartis, ^ancis, and other munitionis that ^ se in their
army. Because ye samyn may nocht be vsit but strenth of body and craft of
ingyne. Of quhylk is nocht amang our fayis. And sen our ennymes been febyl and
effeminat personis, sic ordinance salbe mair impediment to thaym than proffit
quhen they fle, les than the same be haistely cassyn fra thaym. Nochtheles I
beseik ow haif na les sicht to all materis pertenand to ou^ ennymes than to our
self. And gif e intend to fecht, pas nocht fra disciplyne of cheualry. Gyf e
happin to follow on the chase of ennymes, be war yat e follow in array and
ordoure, in adventure (gif e stragill fra our fallowis) e fall in pray to our
vincust ennymes, to our great dishonor and schame. Pas forthwart (lusty
gallandis) and assail gif Brytonis can decide the richt of battall be the
swerd. Pas forth wart my true knychtis, in quhome dekeyit neuir manheid,
wisdom, nor pyssance. And know well I am he, ye sal condingly reward nobyll
and vaileant men with may riches, and punis febyll cowartis with torment and
schame. Skarsly was these orison endit, quhe^ the Britonis war seen descend in
arrayit battall to the planis. Than Dongard with great curage and spre^^ arrayit
his army, and commandit na prisoneris nor spuleis to be taken quhyll the field
war clearly discomfist. And may of all desyrit, that na gentle man suffer
him self to be taken cowartly as prisoneir. In continent both the armyis iunit
with huge noyis and clamoure. The confiderat pepyl assaileit their ennymes in
sic cruelte, yat they put both ye wyngis to flycht. Bot the myddylward maid
resistance, quhare king Constantyne faucht may vaileantlye, and prolongit
battall. Than king Dongard ernystly beheld in every part quhare king
Constantyne faucht. And fynalye was enkendlit be hye curage to do sum notabyll
vassalage, and richt desyrus to sla king Constantyne, And in this fury
accumpanyit with ane few nowmer of chosyn men he ruschit fersly amang the
thickest preis of Britonis, quhare he fecht and with na les manheid than
cruelte to the deith for falt of support was borne to the ground with dynt of
speris, and slane, because he wald nocht be taken. Money of the Scottis astonist
be suddane slauchter of the king, tuke ye flycht. Otheris not affrayit bot mair
feirs and rasit to revenge his slauchter perseuerit in contyne wall battall to
the deith. And the Pychtis on the same manner, faucht with great manheid and
curage to the end of this battall. And it the vyctory was vncertane quhill
mydday. And than ye Britonis were discomfist and put a bak. In this unhappy
battall were slane of Britonis.xvi.M. and of Scottis and Pychtis.xiiii.M. King
Dongard was slane the fyft eir of his regne. In ye.viii. eir of Leo emprioure.
Fra the incarnation iiii.C.lxv. eris.

How Constantine the first and third brothir to Eugenius was maid king of
Scottis. Of his unhappy life and tyranny. And how Constantyne king of Britonis
was slane be gile of pichtis. Ca. vii.
THe Scottis and Pichtis were sa brokin be this sorrowful victory, that they
micht nocht follow with lang chase on the Britonis, and returnyt hame with ye
body of king Dongard. And buryit it with funeral triumph in Colmekill. Sone
eftir ane conuention was maid and Constantyne brodir to Doungard maid king. For
the sonnis of king Dongard were of so tender age, that they mycht nocht
immediatlye succeid to the crown. This Constantyne was rycht discrepant fra ye
maneris and virtew of his brodir. For he was borne more to sensual pleseir yan
to any governance of ane realm For he was ane rauisar of virginis, fulear of
matronis, great nurisar and fauorar of detractoures. He was ay trist and
sorrowful amang his nobillis, and come bot sendyll in their cumpanyis. Be
contrar he reiosit and schew him triumphant prince amang fydlaris, sangstaris
and siclyk men of vile reputation. And youcht he was lik Co^stantyne king of
Britonis in name, it he was far discorda^t fra him i^ maneres, for Constantine
king of britonis na les religious than ciuyll in his governance, recouerit the
realm of Britonis. And decorit it with notable maneris. Bot Constantyne king
of Scottis was sa degenerat and ignobill, that he did no thing semand to ane
king. Quhen his nobillis desyrit him to revenge the slauchter of king Dongard
his brodir, he said he knew weill eneuch quhat was to be done concerning publik
administratioun, and nedit na ingyne bot his awin to beir all chargis of his
realm. Finaly his governance maid his folly patent. For he gave peace to
Britonis with small tretie. And but any consultatioun of his nobillis, he
remittit nocht only the tribute of Britonis, bot randerit to thaym sindry
strenthis of the bordouris, and was to do sindry things more importable to
their co^moun weill, were nocht the nobillis withstude his insolence in time. At
last quhen the matter was brocht to sic point. That nocht apperit bot rebellioun
aganis him in all partis. Dougall of Galloway ane man of great auctorite schew be
money reasonis, quhat infinite trubill were appering to the cuntre, gif it were
inuadit with domistik and civil weris. And yan specially sen the Britonis hes
laitlie recouerit their realm. And rysyng ilk day with more pissance, having
ane ong prince richt fers and desyrus of glore, and reddy (quhen he saw
occasion) to inuaid ye Scottis and Pychtis with battall. Atour the Britonis
kepit neuir good peace to their nychtbouris, bot quhen thai dred thaym may.
Als the Pychtis were ane pepill full of slychtis inclinand ay, quhair they
beleuit victory to follow. Bot Co^stantyne king of Scottis was bot ane
effeminat glutoun, and luffit na man of virtew nor honest. Bot only thaym
that were geuyn to yair se^sualite and lust of wambe. Thus apperit he nothir
abill for private nor publik administratioun. And thairfore ye Ire and seditioun
yt was amang thaym was to be first mesit. And abid ane gana^d time, that every
thing may be done with more wisdom. The pepill obeyit to their persuasionis of
Dougall, howbeit money of yame were variant in their opinioun, rycht co^mouit
that the realm was sa money eris misgydit be this wickit tyrane. The Pychtis
seeing ye king of scottis drownit in vice on this manner but any sign of virtew
apperyng, dred that the Britonis should incres thairthrow the more fers and
insolent and inuaid thaym to revenge auld iniuris. And thairfore the said
Pichtis tuke purpos to do the thing he slycht that they mycht nocht do ^e
force. And instruckit certane men quietly to sla Constantyne king of Britonis.
The men (that were subornat to this effect) come in Britane. And were haldyn as
native pepill thairof. At last they come in ye kings court, quhair they be
vane assentationis and subtell behauyngis gat sic familiarite with the king.
That they purchest credence in sindry his may grave materis. At last wata^d
their time (quhen the king was at quiet) they come to him as sum hie besynes
were to be done. And slew him, suspeck and na thing les than their treason. The
kyngis guard herand the ru^missyng and granis of ane deand man ruschit haistely
in ye chalmer. Quhair they fand ye king slane and bullerand in his blude.
Nochtwithstandyng with brym fury they followit sa fast on their Pichtis. That
they were both ta^kin and cruelly put to deid. This slauchter of Constantyne
king of Britonis happinnit in the.xv. eir of Constantyne king of Scottis.
Quhilk had lityl better fortoun than had this other Constantyne king of
Britonis. For he was slane be ane gentil man of the Ilis for the defowlyng of
his douchter. Eftir yat he had gouernit Scotland unworthily.xvii. eris.

Of king Congallus and of his administration. How the monk Consta^tius was
maid king of Britonis. How Vortigern be slauchter of the said Constantius tuke
the crown of Britane. Ca. viii.
COnstantyne king of scottis slane in yis manner, His nepote Congallus son to
king Dongard was maid king. Yis Congallus was a man of hie ingyne als abill to
weir as peace. it i^ ye beginning of his regne he schew him geuin halelye to
peace. And maid him to repare all thyngis done be necligence of Constantyne his
eme. Su^ gaif him counsal to revenge ye slauchter of his fadir Dongard.
Nochttheles because he was bot ane oung prince nocht stabillit in his empire, he
supersedit sic hie materis, Quhill ane time more gana^d occurrit. And finalie
he did sic Justice throw al pertis of his realm. That ye same was brocht to
good tranquillite and peace. Quhill Congallus was geuin to werkis of Justice on
this wise, Uortigern ane man of great slycht and autorite amang the Britonis tuk
purpos to conques the crown, and to bring his purpos to effect, he tuke
Constantius son to Constantyne king of Britonis, before rehersit out of the
relygyon quhare he was professed monk, After that his fader fand him vnabyll to
regne. And be assistence of syndry great princis of Brytane, this Uortigern maid
this Constantius king of Britane. This slycht procedit be avarice of Uortigern.
Traistyng (because this monk had na experience of the world) that he mycht have
the governance of ye realm and co^ques great riches under his empire. And after
yat he was enrichit in guddis to distroy the said Constantius, and usurp the
crown of Britane. it to couir his slicht (as he war geuyn allutterly for the
common weill) he maid peace with Scottis and Pichtis, and causit ane hundredth
Scottis and Pichtis to come to London to remane (as ane guard) about this
Co^stantius, and to have his body in keeping. At last quhen Uortigern had
gaderit great treasouris under the empire of Constantius, he thocht the time
convenient to tak the crown, and quietly seducit ane certane of Scottis and
pichtis with great soumes of money to sla ye king. And promyttit (gif they
brocht this matter to effect) to reward thaym condingly for their laubouris. The
scottis and pichtis blyndit be avarice and geuand ouir haistely credence slew
fynaly this king Constantius. Als sone as Uortigern knew the king slane (for he
was not far of abydyng the end of that matter) he ruschit fersly in the secret
chalmer, quhare the king was lyand deid both and i^ his blude. And incontinent
tuk the slay aris of the king and slew thaym haistely that they should nocht
schaw that he perswadit thaym to sla the king. And incontinent he began to
lament the kyngis slauchter as na thing war sa displesand to him as the kyngis
deith. For be his deith money infinite harmys sall haistely follow in damage of
the commoun weill. Incontinent this Uortigern socht the resydew of Scottis and
Pichtis out of all partis of the town, (howbeit they war innocent of his
treason) and gart have thaim to strange presoun. Syne maid him to burye the
king. On the morrow he come with his freindis and fauouraris, (quhylkis war
corruppit with his money) to the stretis, quhare mais^ confluence of pepyll
was, and complanit the treasoun of Scottis and Pichtis, quhilkis slew the king
that was committit in their keeping, and maid ye realm (sa far as was i^ yan^e)
but ane heid to that purpos (as apperit) other to divide the Britonis amang
thaym self, or ellis to make all the lands under their empire for falt of ane
king patent to iniure of ennymes. Heirfore gif this odius cruelte war nocht
condinglye punist, mai^ displesouris sall follow haistely (gyf mair may be) in
euersion of their co^moun weill. Necessar war thairfore to punis all the
remanent Scottis and pichtis. For they war na les criminal than the principal
personis yat was taken be him with hait blud and put to deith. Quhen he had
mouit the pepil in may cruelte aganis their innocent men, he tuk thaym out of
prison quhare they war, and put thaym all to deith. This punytioun maid on the
Scottis and pichtis causit Uortigern to be haldin ama^g the ygnorant pepyl as
fader and defendoure of their realm. Nochtheles to cover this dissait, h^
desyret thaym to have respect to their commoun weill. And to suffer nocht
Ambrosius the son of king Co^stantyne to regne. Saying yocht he was richtuous
air to the crown of Brytane, it he was of sa febyll and tender age, that
infinite harmys sall follow to the realm in ye empire of his non age. At last
quhen they had co^cludit ye Ambrose sall not be maid king vortigern dema^dit
yame, quho^ they wald make king. And incontinent all the pepyll with huge noyis
and clamor declarit him king. Als sone as Uortigern was maid king on this
wise, he stuffit al ye castellis and strenthis of London with great munitionis
and weirmen. Syne co^mandit ane certane of his familiares and freindes (quhome
he promouit before to riches and honors) to wait on him. and incontinent he
set him to sla all y^ freindis and lynage of king Consta^tyne. Sum of thaym be
vane causis banist, of otheris co^fiscat their guddis* and punist their bodyis
to ye deith.

How Ambrose and Vter the sonnis of king Constantyne fled in Bertan^e. How
Gvvytell prince of vvalis was slane be the Scotti^. and his army discomf^st.
Ca. ix.
THrow feir of their cruelteis, Ambrose and Uter sons to king Constantyne come
out of Walis (quhare they war kepit under wise p^ceptouris) and fled in
Bertane. In the mean time the Scottis and Pichtis war aduertist of ye
schamefull murdir of yair freindis maid at London be treason of king Uortigern.
Impacient thairfore to suffer this iniure they enterit haistely with ane army
in the Brytonis landis, and inuadit the samyn with great cruelte of fire and
sword. The Brytonis oppressed with their afflictionis disparit of support and
nocht of power to resist, left all thyngis behynd thaym that mycht nocht be
tursit and fled within ye cuntre. Uortigern herand their cruelteis done to his
pepyl, and knawyng the great hatrent that the nobyllis of Brytonis bure aganis
him for his persute aganis the sonnis of Constantyne, began (as the nature of
ane tyrane is) to have ylk man in dredour. And because he durst nocht ieoperde
him self in battall he send Gwytell prince of Walis with ane army to revenge ye
iniuris done be Scottis and Pychtis. Gwytell dreidand the rewyne of Brytane
(gif the Scottis and Pichtis war nocht haistely repressit) went forthwart with
his army, and was conuoyit in the samyn landis of Britane, quhare ye scottis
and pychtis war gaderit but array, inuadyng the cuntre with syndry incursyonis.
Incontinent with displayit baner he set sa haistely on thaym, that they war put
to flycht, and.v.C. of thaym taken, quhame he gart iustefy (as theuis). The
confiderat kyngis mouit with their iniuris come with ane new army, and maid the
Britonis richt astonist. Nochtheles Gwitel exhortit thaym to battal, saying the
Scottis and pichtis war ane pepyll mair accustumat with reiffis and slauchter
of wiffis and harnis, than any marcial dedis, and gettis na victory, bot only
of febyl and myserabyll creatouris. The Brytonis infla^mit to great curage be
their wordis went forthwart, and set down yair tentis beside ye tents of yair
e^nymes. Followit tha^ frequent skarmyssing, and sumtymes syngular battallis
betuix vaileant men. At last both the armyis impatie^t to sustene athir
iniures ruschit fersly togidder, and faucht lang time with vncertane victory.
Quhyl at last ye middilward (quhare Co^gallus faucht) was neir discomfist. Than
Gallanus king of Pichtis (for he faucht in the rycht wyng) seand his co^fiderat
brothir in sic da^geir come with ane cumpany of chosyn men and maid ye Britonis
that faucht fornens Co^gallus richt astonyst The Scottis (youcht they war neir
vincust before fra thai war supportit on this manner) ruschit with new curage on
their ennymes and fynalye put both the wyngis of Britonis to flycht. Als sone
as the Pychtis saw the victory inclyne to Scottis they tuke haistely the tentis
of Brytonis that the same should be na rescours to thaym after. Thus war the
Brytonis slane but any refuge in all partis quhare they fled and war fynalye
randerit to Scottis and Pychtis. The confiderat kyngis gave all the spuleis and
presoneris conquest at this time frelye amang their army, because they faucht sa
vaileant lie that day. Sic thyngis done the confiderat kyngis went forthwart
with their victorious army to take the remanent strenthis on the bordouris. In
this battal war slane twenty thousand Brytonis with Gwytell prince of Walis and
money other nobyll men of Britane. Bot of Scottis and Pychtis war skarsly.iiii.
thousand slane.

How Vortigern send ambassatoures in Almany to fe vvageouris in his support.
How Hengest and Orsus come in Britane with.x. thousand Saxonis. And of their
cruelteis and vassalage done aganis Pychtis. Ca. x*
THe Brytonis after this present discomfitour conuenit quhare vortigern was at
London to advise be quhat craft and ingyne this dangerus battal was to be led
aganes yair cruel ennymes. After lang consultation (because na sicker way couth
be deuisit to deliver the pepyl fra extreme dangeir appering) King Uortigern
nakit of counsall and hauand sa money scharp aduersarys both at hame and on
field tuk purpos to depart out of Britane in sum uncouth realm, nochtheles his
freindis thocht unworthy yat he should pas fra hi^ and souerane dignite, hauand
as it na experience of aduersite to be ane myrrour of derision to his e^nymes.
Best was thairfore (as they allegit) to assail the vter fine of his materis,
and mair honest to him to be vincust in his just defense than to be victorius
in his wrangus action. And youcht he was vincust be one battall, it na
disperatioun should follow. For their was riches and gold sufficient in Brytane
nocht only to dant their ennymes be chance of Battall, bot als to ding thaym
out of Albion. Quhare mycht their be sa plesand or sa co^modius sicht for yair
common weil? as to se ye cruel Saxonis, Scottis, and Pichtis fechtand and
distroyand other for the liberte allanerly of Brytane. For be this and be nane
other way mycht the cruelte of their ennymes be best dantit, Uortigern apprisit
this counsall, and send ambassatouris with money in Almany to fe wageouris to
defend his realm aganis ye Scottis and Pichtis. Than was amang the Saxonis two
brethir namyt Hengist and Orsus dyscending of the anciant blude of that region,
richt vaileant in dedis of armis, and desyrus of na thing mair than of glore
and honouris. Their two brethir herand the desyris of the ambassatouris tuke
wageis and come in Britane with.x. thousand weil exerrit and vaileant men. Their
Saxonis war the mair plesandly ressauit be Uortigern that both his self and
his realm was approchyng to sa hie dangeir. At last quhen he had rewardit
thaym with money and riches he causit the co^monis to remane in their tentis,
and the nobillis to remane in the nixt townis quhyll they war refreschit of
their travel and walkyng be ye seis. Belyue two armyis war prouydit, ane of
Saxonis, and ane other of Britonis, and come forthwart with sic diligence, yt
they war past Humber or ever the Scottis and Pichtis war aduertist of any
cumyng of Saxonis in Britane. The Scottis and Pichtis (yat dwelt that time in
the Britonis landis) war suddanly affrayit be cumyng of the Saxonis. And because
they war nocht of power to resist sa huge army, ane certane of yame saif fit
thaym self be flycht. And the remane^t fell in pray to their ennymes. The
Sa^onis traistyng al things ye better to succeid (gyf they gat ye first blude)
slew all the prisoneris taken be thaym at this time but any miseration of estait
or age. And nocht content of the murdir maid on Scottis and Pichtis betuix
Humber and Tyne, they went in the Mers and Pentland, and inuadit the pepyll
thairof with great cruelteis of fire and slauchter. Traisting fra ye Pichtis war
brocht to fynall exterminioun, the landis pertenand to Scottis mycht be the
mair esy pray. The Pichtis affrayit be their cruelteis send their ambassatouris
to Congallus king of Scottis, desyring him to cum with all his power in haist to
resyst their ennymes, quhylkis war nocht gadderit of febyl Brytonis, bot of
may cruel Saxonis. Skarsly was this message maid to scottis, quhen tythyngis
come that Brytonis and Saxonis in arrayit battal war cumyn i^ Pentland, puttand
the pepyl in all partis (quhare they cum) to heirschip and slauchter. The king
of Pichtis impacient to suffir their iniuris assemblyt his pepyll with may
diligence, and met his ennymes but advise of Scottis. Hengist governor of all
the army under Uortigern, arrayit ye samyn in sic manner that he inuadit ye
pichtis with.iii. battallis at anis. Thus war the Pichtis sa ouirset with
multitude of ennymes yat thai war put to flicht. This day maid ye Saxonis mair
reiosit tha^ Britonis. For Hengist beheld the Britonis fechtand this day mair
febilly tha^ any other pepyll. And for ye cause he tuke ferme purpos to conques
their realm. After that Scottis and Pichtis war doung out of all boundis of
Brytane.

Of the secund message send be Pichtis to the Scottis. How the Scottis and
Pichtis faucht aganis ye Saxonis and Britonis, and war discomfist* Ca. xi.
THe Pichtis brokyn in this manner send their secund message to Co^gallus
desyryng haisty support aganis ye Saxonis. Quhen their ambassatouris had schawin
to Congallus the cruelteis done be saxonis and Britonis, they desyrit him and
his nobillis to suffer nocht the Pichtis their auld confiderat freindis to be
distroyit be their cruel and unmerciful ennymes. In adventure they be brynt
sone eftir with the same fla^mys with quhilk ye Pychtis ar now presently
consumyt. Congallus mouit be co^miseratioun of ye trubil falling to his
confiderat friends the Pychtis. And seand the same truble (les than it were the
more resistit) approaching haistelie to scottis co^mandit all fensabill men
within his realm to meit him in the south part of the wod of Calidon the.xx.
day eftir with two monethis vittallis under the pane of deith. Be this edict he
gaderit.xl.M. men strange and weil armyt at all devise. And come sone eftir in
his ennymes sycht hauand with him his confiderat freindis ye Pychtis. Als sone
as his army saw yair ennymes of more nowmer and ordinance than euir they saw
before they fled in sindry partis to eschew the present dangeir. The confiderat
kyngis send incontinent their capitanis to tak ye flearis, quhilkis were
apprehendit and put to deith on Iebattis, to be exempill to otheris of their
fleyng. Be their punitionis all the dredour and fleyng of the Scottis army was
set aside. Als sone as Hengist saw the confiderat kyngis in sycht he exhortit
his army to fecht Saying be special favor of goddis was arrayit fornens thaym
the pepill (quhilkis were sa lang perpetual ennymes of Britane) quhair throw
they mycht have sufficient occasion to revenge auld iniuris. And conques both
their riches and landis at their pleseir. And na peril was to be dred. For all
materis behuuit to succeid with great felicite, because yai were to fecht in their
good actioun aganis ane falls and wrangus people, famous theiffis reuaris and
inuasouris of uncouth realms. As to ye victory (sa far as he had any
cognosance be lang experience of battall) their fayis should nocht fail to gif
bakkis als sone as they feill the preis and violence of Saxonis and Britonis.
Ye victory thairfore mon be quhair the goddis hes ordant. Hengist be their
wourdis inflammyt ye myndis of Saxonis to great rage and cruelte aganis their
ennymes. The Britonis ereckit in curage be exemple of Saxonis desyrit battall.
On the tothir side the confiderat kyngis ceissit nocht with money plesand
persuasionis to exhort their folkis to battall. Sone eftir both ye armyis
Iunyt, quhen suddanlie come on thaim frequent schouris of arrowis and ganeis
schot on every side, and inco^tine^t they ruschit togiddir with scharp swerdis,
speris, and byllis in may hatrent, bot it na party semyt to have victory.
Quhill at last the Britonis (ye faucht in ye rycht wyng aganis ye Scottis) were
put to flycht Than suddanlye come ane huge schoure of haill, and obscurit the
air with sic terrible cloud of mirknes as it had been nycht. Throw quhilk both
ye armyis were sa astonyst, yat yai knew nocht quhedir it was best to fle or
follow. Hengist astonist be this uncouth wounder gaderit his folkis be sound of
trumpat to the standart. Be than the schoure we^ ceissit (quhen the Scottis and
Pichtis) traisting yair ennymes vincust, fell to the chase of Britonis but
array, and maid slauchter and spule in their may fury. Hengist seand the
Britonis vincust, and the co^fiderat pepill geum to spule and slauchter (...)
rum togiddir in array. The confiderat kyngis to put remeid to their impedimentis
and that the curage and spreit of yair army should not dekay be lang tarry
co^mandit ilk man to win als money scherettis on the ground (as he mycht beir)
to make ane gait throw the mos to assail their ennymes. Sic thyngis done the
confiderat kyngis rasit their tentis and maid thaym reddy for battall aganis
the nixt morrow. And believing yat micht nocht inuaid the tentis of ennymes but
extreme dangeir they come throw the mos be ane quiet gait to ane hill that
stude above yair ennymes. Sum of thaym stude in ye face of this hill yat they
micht cast down cragis and stanis amang the oist of futmen. The strenth of this
hyl gaif great curage to our folkis to assail^e sic thyngis, as they beleuit
mycht (...) the array of their ennymes. At ^ast seeing the Saxonis and Britonis
wald nothir Ische fra their tentis, nor it gyf sign of battall to June, they
deuisit be ane new and uncouth slycht to astonis yair ennymes. And in ye nycht
following they brocht ane huge multitude of had^ to the face of the hill
fornentis their ennymes. And because yis haddir is of nature dry, and takes sone
fire yai maid sindry faggottis thairof. And eftir yat they had put thaym in
fire they slang thaym ouir the hill. Incontinent their faggottis were dreuin be
preis of wyndis amang ye tentis of ennymes, quhilkis with great terror were
effrayit. for the stra and stikkis (quhare they lay) tuke fire, and brint
Infinite pepill in their army. Tha^ raise ane huge nois and clamor. And sum
dredyng ye hid watcheing of ennymes ran haistely to defend ye trinchis of yair
te^tis. Otheris maid yame to slok in ye fla^mis ay more incressyng be preis of
wyndis. Finalie the faggottis fell sa fast out of the heuin all blesand
togiddir in fla^mis that na man wist quha^ was to be done, throw rei^d of men
and beistes of quhilkis ane great multitude was in their tentis and throw feir
of low and smouk under nycht, the capitanis was sa trubillit that they
concludit erar to assail their ennymes with extreme ieoperdyis of battall,
than cowartly to be brynt to ye deith And incontinent they ischit fra yair
tentis and past in arrayit battall to the planys. Hengist seeing his folks
mycht nocht be weil haldin within their tentis gaderit the Saxonis be sound of
tru^pat to his standart, and abaid the cumyng of the day. The Scottis and
Pychtis traistyng their ennymes brokin be this effray, left ye strenth quhair
they stude and come arrayit to the planys reddy to gyf battall. Bot quhen they
fand their ennymes in good array, they supersedit their purpos, quhill the
cumyng of the day. On the morrow Congallus exhortit his folkis to consider quhat
glore and honor been conquest be virtew and forcy dedis of their eldaris. And
desyrit thaym to obscure not be their rece^t sleuth ye fame of sa nobill
campionis, and prayit thaym to keip the honor yat their eldaris wan. And think
na thing was sa schamful as to gyf backis to yair ennymes, and be thirllit to
ok of servitude. For na thing was sa honest as other to have victory as their
eldaris did before, or ellis to fecht with glore and manheid to the deith, and
Hengist in the same manner ceissit not to persuade his army to pas forth war^ with
hie curage, and to distroy yair ennymes. Quhilk bea^d done, they micht reiose
the residew of their dayis but any dangeir of weris. Skarsly were yir words
said, quhe^ both ye armyis iunit. At ye first metyng both ye saxonis and
britonis had been disco^fist were not ane buscheme^t of.iii.M. fresche men come
haistely out of ane wod (quhare they were hid be Hengist) to yair support. Their
fresche me^ come with great noyis and clamor on ye bakkes of scottis. Thus were
the confiderat pepill inuadit on every side to their great terror. And it ye
truble arrais the more, yat every ane of yame was impediment to other in ye
weilding of their wappinnis. Than followit diverse chancis of fortoun. For ye
Pichtis be souerane manheid put ye Britonis ye faucht fornentes yame to flicht,
and perseuerit i^ sic furious rage of chase aganis yame, ye money of Britonis
were dreuin to eschape their cruelte i^ ye nixt river quhair they perist.
Otheris taken be ye gait war slane. Bot ye Scottis (quhilkes war inuadit thus on
aithir side be Saxonis) eftir lang perseverance in battall were finalie vincust
and slane. Co^gallus evil woundit was brocht out of the feilde be his freindis
to the nixt montanis. The Saxonis eftir this victory of Scottis tuk purpos to
persew the Pichtis. For they vincust (as said is) the britonis. Nochtheles be
cumyng of the nicht they supersedit yair purpos to ye morrow. Their pichtis
dreidand to be inuadit be saxonis on the morrow gaderit all their cofferis,
cartis, wanis, and other thi^gis (quhilk mycht not be weil tursit for ye time)
and put yame all in fire, yt the fume and reik thairof mycht obscure the air
quhill they war past all dangeir. Sic thyngis done ye Pichtis returnit hame
with ye residew of Scottis quhilkis were eschapit out of this field,

How Hengist was maid protector of Britane, and how he brocht his son Occa
with.x.M. Saxonis to resist the armyis of Ambrose and Vter. How Vortigern
come to ane ba^ket with He^gist* and mariit Roxena his doucht. Ca. xiiii.
HEngist after the syndry chancis of victory fallyn in this last field began to
nowmer his army, and fand the confiderat pepyl fled and.iiii.M. Saxonis slane.
Syne returnit with ye residew yairof to ork, and co^mandit yame to be reddy to
resist yair ennymes gif any new trubyl apperit. Incontinent he returnit to
London to take consultation with Uortigern and his noblis quhat was to be done
concerning ye weris of scottis and Pichtis in times cumyng. Uortigern ressauit
him with great reverence and honor, and proclamit him protector of his realm
and pepyll, with power and auctorite to use all the townis, strenthis, and
riches thairof at his pleseir. Sine co^mandit publict playis to be maid throw
all pertis of Britane with general procession to geif loving to god, for the
excellent victory falling to him above his ennymes. And to entrete Hengist with
mair pleseir, he gaif him and his pepyll license to make adoratioun to ydolis
after the manner of gentilis. In ye mean time was schawin to Uortigern that
Ambrose and Uter ye sonnis of king Constantine war makand great puruia^ce in
Bartane to recover ye crown of britane. Their tithingis maid Uortigern affrayit.
For he had ane prophecy, that he should be slane be this Ambrose. Nochtheles he
inquirit Hengist, be quhat ingine and power he micht best resist the army of
Ambrose. Hengist glad of his trubyl promyttit till resist the army of Ambrose
and Uter gif he wald suffer ye Saxonis quhilkis dwelt in ork schire to cu^ to
the sea camp fornens France. And the castellis and strenthis of that cuntre to
be deliuerit to him and his folkis, that he mycht the mair esaly resist Ambrose
and Uter quhen they landit. Als sone as their petitionis war grantit, Hengist
desyryng na thing mair than to have ye Britonis vterly distroyit (that yair
realm mycht fall in pray to him and his Saxonis) instruckit ane man of Almany
(as he had been ane Britone) to cum to Uortigern with dissimilit wordis. saying
he was laitly cumyn fra Pe^tland, quhare he saw na thing bot knychtis schynyng
in armor. The trumpattis soundyng and the gold^^ stremaris reflirand aganis
the (...). And schortly all the pepyll of that regioun reddy in may weirly
sort to cum haistely on the Britonis. This Almane that was subornat in this
wise said to He^gist. Their was ane.C. oung and vaileant men of Scottis sworn
all of ane mind to distroy him. And had na sicht to yair lyuis, sa they mycht
bring their purpos to effect, for they held him the pyllar of Britonis. Syndry
of their personis were cumyn at ye same time to London to execute their myndis.
And thairfore na place mycht be souir to him, bot quhe^ he beleuit leist, sum
of their men sworn to the effect foresaid sal wair yair lyuis on him. And yocht
he eschape ane, force was to abide the chance of the residew. Because the
Scottis and Pichtis traistis (quhen he is slane) to be delyuerit of all
trubyll. Uortigern astonist be this feneit slycht demandit Hengist quhat was to
be done, Hengist apperit richt effrayit in the same manner. Nochtheles syndry of
the Saxonis (quhilkis war instruckit be ye said Hengist) prayit Uortigern to be
of good comfort, for youcht he war inuadit on every side with ennymes, he should
be souir of Saxonis to defend him in all his weris. For ye confiderat pepill
(quhilkis hes prouyn ye chance of battall fechtand unhappily aganis ws) sal
neuir atti^pt ane thing mair to their damage, tha^ to inuaid thy pepyll with
iniuris, and provoke ws agane to battall. And gif Ambrose and Uter come (as is
beleuit) with huge pepyll on the south partis of the realm, siclike as the
confiderat pepyll intendis to do on the north partis thairof, than sal Occa ye
son of Hengist (quhilk is ane vaileant knycht and exercit in cheualry sen his
first outh) cu^ with ane new band of Saxonis. Throw quhilk thou salbe souir fra
all invasion that may follow to the and thy realm. For Occa sall resist the
scottis and pichtis in the north. And Orsus ye army cumyng with Ambrose out of
Bertane. And Hengist sall remane ay with thy self to keip thy body fra treason
of Britonis, gif any of yame be favor of Ambrose wald pretend any rebellioun
aganis thy auctorite. Be quhilk way thou sall have merry dayis but any feir of
ennymes. Uortigern knawi^g na other way apperand to dant his ennymes in all
partis (because money of the noblis of Britane haitit his maneris) maid great
instance to He^gist to send for his son Occa to cum haistely in Britane with
ane band of Saxonis to resist his ennymes. Hengist wirk and his purpos with
dissimilit mind and slicht, maid him to withstand the kyngis desire. Saying it
was (...) damage to have both him self and his son sa far distant fra ye
governance of his landis and possessi^^is. Nochtheles be lang instance o^ (...)
and other Britonis (quhilkis war mair set for ye kyngis folly and pleseir, tha^
for ye common weil) condiscendit to his desyris. Within few dayis after Occa
arriuit in Britane with.x.M. saxonis, and sat down in Northumberland with
wyffis and barnis reddy to fecht aganis all pepyll that list invade thaym.
Hengist knawing the cumyng of his son, and this new army of Saxonis desirit
king Uortigern to cum, and se his wife children and frendis, quhilkis war reddy
to al service and chargis as he wald command. And said it should raise his army in
great curage, gif he wald do ye honor to decore thaym with his presence.
Uortigern richt glad of ye cumyng of this new band of Saxonis condiscendit to
his desyris. How beit money of his nobyllis war richt heavy and tuke na lytyl
suspitioun that sa huge nowmer of Saxonis war cumyn i^ britane aganis yair
common weill* Fynaly Uortigern come with ane certane of his nobillis to
Towquha^ castle, quhare he was plesandly ressauit and feistit with all manner of
delytis and plesouris that micht be deuysit. Than Hengest set him to prolong
the banquet within the nycht yt the king mycht be takin with ye wynis.
Incontinent Roxena ye douchter of Hengist (as scho was instruckit) went to the
king with ane coupe full of mychty wine, and said, I drink to ye, King Uortigern
drank mychtely of the coupe, and quhen he had embrasit her in his armis, he set
her down nixt him self in the banquet. After lang co^monyng he fell in blind
raige of lust. Quhilk thing was nocht only occasion to him after to do
adultry, bot als to tine his kingdom. For incontinent throw birna^d flame of
new lust he had nothir respect to the law of god nor it to the law of matrimony
before contrackit with his lauchfull wife. And but mair delay he tuk the said
Roxena to his wife. Syne gaif to Hengist all ye landis of Kent with castellis,
to w^is, and munitionis pertenyng thairto. Sone after the saxonis sat down in
the samyn with yair wiffis and childrin and put out the auld inhabitantis
thairof. Sic thingis done Uortigern returnit with his new queen to London, and
repudiat his lauchfull wife.

How Vodyne bischop of London with money preistis war slane be tyranny of
Saxonis. How Hengist maid him self king of Kent. How Vortigern was depriuit
and Vortimer his son maid king of Britane. Ca. xv.
VOdyne byschop of London ane man of singular deuotioun and life, be advise of
Uortimer went familiarly to Uortigern, and schew yat he had not done (as ane
cristin prince) departing fra his lauchfull queen and takand ane other woman to
his wife. Quhais fader Hengist duke of saxonis was both ennyme to the cristin
faith and set with delyuerit mind to conques the crown of Britane and said sen
he had sa done, he should sone have experience quhat damage should follow to his
pepill nocht only in euersion of ye cristin faith in britane, bot als in
translation of the nobyll realm of britane (quhilk was brocht hail and vnbroki^
under money nobil pri^cis to his days) i^ ane uncouth blud. Than said Uortigern.
I have faileit and was nocht prudent quhe^ I brocht Saxonis first in Brytane to
support me aganis my ennymes, and that was the first beginning of my folly. Bot
I semit mair imprudent quhe^ I was taken be immoderat lust of his doucht Roxena.
For I know weill the end of my empire salbe terribyll, bot gif my offense be
the mair haistely reparit to god. And yairfore (sa far as I may) I sall put
remeid thairto. Hengist heirand ye sound of this lamentabyll regrait come in
the sectet chalmer (quhare he was) and repreuit him, quhy he maid sa heavy cheir
in the time of his marriage be persuasioun of ane profane man of feneit life.
and incontinent he slew the haly man Uodyne with money other preistis and
relligious personis being with him for the time* and to attempt ane thing of
more audacite he seirchit Uortimer to ye deith. Uortimer knawyng his evil mind
aganis him fled quhare he thocht expedient. In ye mean time Hengest send
secret writingis to his son Occa, co^mandyng him to abstene fra any forther
iniuris of scottis and pichtis and suffer thaym peciably reiose all the landis
beond Tyne. Providing always yt the strenthis betuix Tyne and Humber be weill
garnist with me^ and vitallis. And forthir he co^mandit him to seik sum
occasion quhare throw he micht sla all the noblis of ye cuntre quhare he was,
and to have sic respect to ye common weill of saxonis, ye Britane micht cu^
sumtyme under yair empire. Occa knawing ye mind of his fader, tuk first ork
with money other strenthis and munitionis of ye cuntre. And as his fader deuysit
he slew money noblis and barons be feneit causis. And quhen he was accusit be
Uortigern, quhy he did sic cruelteis on his noblis, he answerit as he was
instruckit be his fader yt their noblis (quhilkis be him war slane) were ennymes
to ye king. Because he had Saxonis in mair reverence tha^ britonis. And yir
noblis intendit to have ra^derit ork with money other great strenthis and
munitionis of Brytane to scottis and pichtis, were not he put remeid mair
haistely yairto. Als the bou^dis of Britane geuyn to his keeping should not have
been gouernit prudently, gif ye samyn had not been purgit fra all inuasouris of
their common weill, for sic doingis should cu^ after, both to ye great proffet of
ye king and honor of his realm. The cruelte of Saxonis ylk day mair
incressing aganis ye Britonis maid Uortigern na lytyl co^mouit, and the mair yt
he considerit yame daily seikand occasion to conques his realm. And quhe^ he
could find na sicker remeid aganis ye said dangeir, he began with drery
contenance to deplore his mysfortoun. Sum of his familiaris gaif him counsall
to dant the cruelte of Saxonis, quhill he mycht but pley, in adventure the
Britonis brokin be yair iniuris war brocht to sic calamite yt they mycht nothir
have sufficient pyssance to distroy their ennymes nor it to defend their
realm. King Uortigern hauand the Britonis in na les suspicion tha^ the Saxonis
(because he was odius to yame both) supersedit to attempt yis great matter, for
certane dayis. In the mean time ye Britonis brokin with intollerabyll iniuris
sustenit mair cruelteis of Saxonis. than ever they sufferit before of any other
pepyl. And above their skaithis followit other syndry outtragis mair odius and
importabyll to thaym. For Hengist left king Uortigern, and come to ye resydew
of Saxonis at Kent, and be general edict chargit al Britonis to pas out of the
samyn within ane schort day under ye pane of deith. The day byrun he slew both
commonis and nobyllis but any favor, mercy, or ransoun, yat ganestude his
command. Al wayis y^ Saxonis enragit in sic inhumane cruelteis, yt all the
kirkis and sanctuaris of Kent war suspendit with crystyn blude. The nunnis and
religious weirmen war taken be force out of their abbayis and constranit to
marriage or pollutioun of their bodyis. The lordis of Britane commouit be their
sorrowful iniuris maid ane conuention at London (quhare they repreuit
Uortigern) that he put the Saxonis on his secret counsall, knawyng thaym bot
ane hethyn pepyll leuand after the lawis of gentilis, and nocht brocht in
Brytane to beir the governance of the realm, bot only to sustene the weris
aganis their ennymes. Attoure they schew that he was vnprudent in sa far as he
enrychit ye Saxonis with landis, rentis, and auctoryte in dystructioun of all
his realm and legis, and nocht only repudiat his wife, bot aganis the
institutionis of crystyn faith maryit ane woman, quhylk was of the ryte of
gentylis. Fynalye because he deseruyt the haterent of god for syndry
abhomynabyll cruelteis fallyn in the realm be his folly and neclige^ce,
exponyng both their pepyll and common weil to extreme dangeir, they degradit
him of all auctoryte, and send him in Walis, quhare he remanit money eris after
in prysoun. And that they should nocht be without ane heid, yai maid his son
Uortime^ king.

How Scottis and Pichtis war confiderat with king Vortimer aganis the
Saxonis and discomfist Occa in Northumberland. How Hengist and Occa war
vincust i^ Kent. and doung out of Britane. How king Vortimer was slane be
poison. Ca. xvi.
UOrtimer maid king in these manner, thocht na thing sa honorabyll as to invade
the Saxonis ennymes of god be strange battal, and to do ye samyn with mair
felicite, he send ambassatouris to ye confiderat kyngis (quhilkis had ye
Saxonis in may hatrent) to schaw yt the iniuris done to thaym be Saxonis*
procedit only be king Uortigern but any advise of his nobyllis. For yocht
Saxonis war enrichit with la^dis and rentis be Uortigern, it al ye noblis of
Brytane war ennymes to thaym, knawing yair myndis set to vter euersion of their
realm and lyberte, as apperis weil be yair cruel dedis excercit laitly to na
les blasphematioun of god, tha^ martyrdom of crystyn pepyll. and because yir
and money other importabyl cruelteis were cumyn be neclige^ce of Uortigern
assister to yair opinion, ye nobles hes degradit him of auctorite and maid
vortimer his son king. And forthir yai schew how Uortimer hes maid great
ordinance of battal to expel ye saxonis out of Albio^, and desirit yair fore ye
co^fiderat kings to set aside all iniuris, and concur with yame to resist ye
common trubyl appering to al ye pepil of Albion, and promittit (gif yai wald
support ye Britonis in this extreme dangeir) to geif ye landis beond Hu^ber but
any pley i^ times cumyng to to their perpetual empire with consent of all the
nobyllis and co^monis of Britane. Congallus king of scottis heirand their
offeris said to their ambassatouris, he understood weill in quhat dangeir ye
realm of Britane stude be treason of Saxonis ennymes to cristyn faith, and was
richt sorry thairof, knawing na thing bett (gif they war nocht resisti^ in time)
ye catholic faith should expire in Britane. and yocht ye Britonis hes been great
ennymes to his pepyll, it to maik his labor manifest both for ye common weil
of britane and heil of cristyn faith he should raise his army and concur with
thaym aganis Saxonis to ye deith. Swa that peace war ratifyit in sic manner
amang their pepyll, that all debaitis micht ceis, and the landis beond Humber
never to be reclamyt in times cumyng be the Britonis, their ambassatouris beand
depeschit with siclyke answer of Pychtis, returnit to vortimer. The ba^d of
peace was ratifyit sone after amang ye britonis, pichtis, and scottis. And
incontinent they ruschit al togidder to harnes aganis the Saxonis. The scottis
and pichtes come with may hatrent aganis the Saxonis dwelling betuix Humber
and Tyne. And quhen they war inuadyng their Saxonis with may cruelteis that
culd be deuisit, they persauit Occa cummand with displayit baner aganis thaym.
Occa seand his ennymes appeir of sic strenth and multitud, yt he micht not weil
geif thaim field* wist not quhat was to be done. Nochtheles y^ lang tarry should
not febyl the curage of his folkis, he maid ane sign be sound of trumpat to
june. The first metyng was equalye fochtyn on all sydis. Bot at last the
Saxonis hauand na pyssance to resist sa great preis o^ ennymes fornens thaim
began to geif bakkis. Occa stoppit their fleing sa far as he mycht, sumtyme be
mynassyng, su^tyme be respect of honouris. Nochtheles ye feir of deith mair
pissant amang abasit pepyll than any charge of capitane maid their disco^fitour
richt patent. Occa seeing nane vthir way to saif his life fled to the mouth of
Hu^ber, quhare he gat ane bait, and come to Thamis with few nowmer of personis.
The Scottis and Pychtis vsit this vyctory with great cruelte on the Saxonis, and
saiffit nane that perseuerit fechtand in the battal. And than ylkane began to
exhort other to follow fast on ye chase, that they mycht revenge the cruelteis
sa money eris done be their Saxonis. Alwayis great nowmer of Saxonis war slane in
ye battall, bot mair nowmer of thaym in the chase. In the mean time Uortimer
rycht desyrus to recover the lyberte of his realm, rasit the baner of the
croce, and commandit all crystyn pepyll to follow the same. Thus he gaderit ane
army of.lxxx. thousand men als weil of preistis and relygyous men, as of
temporal estaitis. And be ye samyn he slew.x.M. Saxonis, and gat sa huge
victory of thaim, y^ Kent schire with money other boundis adjacent war recouerit
to the Brytonis. And all the landis lyand betuix Tyne and Humber restorit to
the Scottis and Pychtis. Hengist and Occa come out of the field with the
resydew of their vincust army and fled in Northumbirland with purpos to remane
yair, quhil new power come to thaym out of Almany. Nochtheles they war doung
out of they bou^dis be scottis and pichtis, and chasit to the mouth of Humber,
quhare they fand schippes and returnit with certane nobyllis of that samyn blud
in Saxony. King Uortimer was sa mercyful after yis victory, yt he brocht lityl
cruelte on the remanent Saxonis, bot sufferit thaym to return in yair awin
cuntre. And otheris (quhylkis war bot commonis) war sufferit to remane in kent
with their wyffis and childrin to lauboure the land under seruytude of
Britonis. Roxena douchter to He^gist was sufferit (because scho was with child)
to remane in ye toure of London with certane keparis to wait on her. Than
Uortimer set him to purge his realm of al heryseis brocht in it be Saxonis.
And to repare the kirkis laitly bet down be thaym. For sindry Britonis war
constranit be cruelte of Saxonis to make sacrifice to ydolis. And money of thaym
fell agane in herysy of Pelagius. And to purge sic arrouris war send in Brytane
out of France two haly byschoppis Germanus and Lupus be desire of king
Uortimer. Fynaly all the Brytonis (that war found repugnant to good religioun)
war other slane or banist the realm. And sa money as wald nocht be abiurat nor
reuoik their arrouris war brint. Uortimer recouerand ye realm of Britane and
bringand the samyn to the sicker faith, leuit certane eris after richt plesand
to god and his subdittis. Bot at last he was poysonit be Roxena and otheris
nobyllis of brytane applauding to her opinion.

How the Britonis after deith of king Vortimer fell in great disputatioun quhay
should be king. And how Vortigern was restorit to the crown of Britane. Ca.
xvii.
After deith of Uortimer ane conuention was maid at London quhare the nobyllis
tuke lang consultation, quhiddir Uortigern should be taken out of prysoun, and
restorit to his auctorite and honouris as he was before. Or gif ye sonnis of
Constantyne should be brocht out of Bertane to succeid to ye crown, sen they war
may natyue thairto. Su^ alliegit yt Uortigern was penitent of all offencis
done be him aganis their common weill, and knawis be la^g experience quhat heavy
damage and iniuris hes fallyn laitly to his pepyll be hes necligence and
vnbridillit lust, and alliegit (sen he was ane prudent prince vnbrokyn with
travel and weiris) he should be restorit to the crown. For he had na thing in
mair hatrent tha^ treason of Saxonis, and knew weil how the realm should be
gouernit specially in sic extreme dangeir, as than apperit both be Franchmen,
Britonis, and Saxonis. And was thairfore may abyl to sustene their chargis,
gif he war sworn neuir to admit any uncouth blude in Brytane to sustene yair
weris. And to invade the Saxonis with all manner of violence (gif they returnit)
in Albioun. As to the sonnis of Constantine to be brocht out of Bertane to
succeid to the crown of Britane, they semyt vnganand thairto. For they war oung
but experience of cheualry, and nocht abil to sustene sa great chargis as
apperit tha^ aganes yair e^nymes i^ al partis. For ye frenchmen (quhilkis
laitly conquest the realm of Gallis now callit France and richt desirus to
conques ma realms) war co^fiderat with ye sonnis of Co^stantyne to cu^ in
britane, and abiding not bot sufficient occasioun to invade the samyn with
siclike iniuris and tytyll of conques as ye Saxonis wald. Throw quhilk ye
cummyng of king Constantinis sonnis in Britane was na les suspicious, than ye
cumyng of Saxonis. Otheris thocht it rycht suspitius to restore him to ye
crown, quhom they before degradit be yair auctorite. For it mycht happyn that
all they (quhilkis war of that opinioun) should other be slane at his returnyng,
or ellis exilit ye realm. Bot it this last opinion was reieckit, be universal
voces of all the noblis. Saying Uortigern was ane man of peace but desire of
vengeance, and set erar to amend all offencis done aganis the weill of his
su^dittis, than to revenge any iniuris done to him, nocht vnknawyng how
proffitabyl all they noblis war for the commoun weill (quhilkis depriuit him of
auctoryte, and gaif it to his son Uortimer as mair abyl for the governance
thairof. After lang consultatioun Uortigern was taken out of prison, and
restorit with great triumph to the crown. And he nocht only remyttit al
offencis and ^atrent, quhylkis he tuk aganis his nobyllis quhen they degradit
him of auctorite, bot als resauit thaym with great beniuolence and rewardit
thaym richely for yair good myndis.

How Hengist and Occa returnit with new power of Saxonis in Britane, and
slew money noblis thairof, and tuk Vortigern prisonere. How Vortigern was
banist in vvalis, and Hengist maid king of Britane. Ca. xviii.
UOrtigern after his restitutioun to the crown of Brytane, garnist all the
strenthis of his realm, with great ordinance aganis quhatsumeuer adventures
mycht fall, and held strange bandis of weirmen about him with na les cost tha^
he had been presently to fecht with e^nymes. And behad him sa prudently, that
both his nobyllis and commonis wist nocht quhat honour^ and pleasour they
mycht do him. Nocht lang after he renewit p^ace with the confiderat kyngis in
the samyn manner, as it was maid before be king Uortimer his son. Quhyll
Uortigern was geuyn to sic materis, tithyngis come that Hengist was arryuit at
Thames hauand with him his son Occa and his two brethir with incredibyll
nowmer of Saxonis, and did na iniuris nor offentis to the inhabytantis of the
cuntre. Uortigern astonist of ye damage appering to his pepil be cumyng of yir
Saxonis, co^mandit the nobyllis of Brytane to meit him haistely with yair power
at Kent to withstand He^gist, quhylk was cumyn with sa awful army. That he
purposit other to subdew the cuntre to his empire, or ellis to put the samyn to
irrecouerabyll heirschip. Quhais inhumane cruelteis being nocht haistely
repressit, na sicker life mycht be to his pepyll. The pryncis of Britane hering
their tithingis come haistely to Uortigern with all fensabyl pepyll under their
boundis. Hengist knawyng ye myndis of Britonis mouit with extreme hatrent
aganis him, thocht nocht expedient for that time to ieoparde him to the chance
of battall. For sen they war delyuerit to fecht for defense of their realm and
lyberte to the deith, he mycht nocht have victory but large murdir of his
pepyll. For their reasonis he set him to do ye thing be slycht, quhylkis he
mycht nocht do be force of armies, and send ambassatouris to Uortigern. Saying
he was nocht cumyn in Britane to defraud his good son Uortigern of the crown
of Britane, for he was mai^ dete and precius to him than any other thing in
erd. Nor it was he set to defraud the ou^g infant gottyn on Roxena hes
douchter, bot erar to support thaym both, and to punis thaym yt slew the nobyl
prince king Uortimer be poison. Attoure he was aduertist before his cumyng out
of Almany yt his good son Uortigern was brocht to sic infirmite be lang
incarceratioun, that he mycht nocht leif ane eir. And yairfore he was cu^myng
to keep his oung nepote vndefraudit of the crown of Britane. And forthir gif
yir materis war not plesand to ye Britonis, he should haistely return agane in
Almany or ellis to remane quhare they plesit. Sa yt they wald suffer his army
to cum in Kent. Nocht to reiose ye landis thairof, bot allanerly to recover ye
gudis quhilkis they left behynd thaym at their departing. And forthir desyrit
king Uortigern (gif it war plesand) to assign ane day and place to
interco^moun of their and hiear materis concerning perpetual amyte, kyndnes,
and peace betuix Saxonis and Britonis. And gif they list set this day* he should
cu^ yair with sa money as they thocht neidfull, armit or vnarmit at their
pleseir. Quhen ye nobyllis had taken consultation certane dayis quhethir their
desiris of Hengist should be repulsit or nocht, they war deuydit in syndry
opinionis. Money of thaym be lang experience knew weill his falset and slichtis,
and beleuit nocht bot treason hyd under dissaitfull wordis, and thairfore
thocht the samyn to be refusit. Otheris dreidand the ferocite and manheid of
Saxonis thocht their realm ouirbro^yn with weiris to suffer any new
affliction. And thairfore concludit to meit his gyle and falset be siclyk
slychtis, having na confidence in his wordis bot to labor may craftily to
cause him depart out of Britane with amyte and freindschip, and to spare nothir
labor nor expen^es to bring his purpos to good fine. And gif he wald na way
depart with beniuolence, to inuaid him may cruelly, and to dyng him out of
their boundis perforce, and deuysit for that same effect ane cu^pany of may
forcy and vaileant men to be haldyn reddy aganis quhatsumeuir adventure mycht
fall, quhyl they saw to quhat purpos or fine his mind was delyuerit. As to ye
metyng of Uortigern and Hengist to interco^moun of hie materis as he deuysit,
they thocht the same honest, sa that king Uortigern and Hengist met fra yair
armyis with equale cumpanyis on all sydis but wappynnis. Money of ye noblis
condisce^dit to this last opinion, traisting fra Hengist had ressauit the
guddis left behynd him in Kent at his last departing, yat he should depart out of
Britane with pleseir. it syndry other pryncis of Britane mycht nocht be
satifyit in yair mind, suspeckand ay sum hyd treason under their desyris of
He^gist, because he was cumyn in Britane with sa awful power. Nochtheles the.x.
day after was fynaly set to Hengist and Uortigern, and both sworn to cum
allanerly with xxx. of the may noblis of both yair armyis, but any swerd or
dagere in their cumpany to intercommoun on all materis to ye effect foresaid.
The place (quhare they co^uenit) was not far fra Salisbery on ane hill callit
Ambry, and quhen they war cumyn to ye samyn as was deuisit be Hengist, ylk
Saxon had ane dagare hyd under his sleif, to sla the noblis of Britane quhen
they saw ganand occasion, and quhen they war at yair may ernest co^monyng,
Hengist maid ane sign to ye Saxonis, and they but any tarry slew all the
nobillis of Britane that come to this conuention except ane namyt Heldolus.
Quhilk pullit ane dagger fra ane Saxoun, and with the samin slew sindry
Saxonis, and deliuerit him self out of yair hands. Be this treasoun king
Uortigerne was takin, and brocht schamfully to ye army of Saxonis. Hengist
deliuerit be this manner of al feir of ennymes come to Kent. The remane^t
britonis rycht astonist of his cuming eftir petuous lamentation for slauchter
of yair nobillis, maid yame with may hatrent to revenge ye samyn. Nocht the
les seand na man able to tak yis charge on hand, they supersedit yair purpos,
and retournyt hame with great displeseir. Uortigern traisting daily to de be
mannassyng of Saxonis, to deliver him self of the present dangeir randerit to
Hengist all the mu^^tionis and strenthis of his realm with huge treasour of
gold and silver i^ co^positioun of his ranson. And quhen he was deliuerit of
bondage be this way, he past with ye residew of Britonis with their wyffis and
childrin in Walis. Quhair all the pepil discendyng of ye Britonis blude money
eris eftir succedit. All the remanent landis of Britane eid than under the
empire of Saxonis. Ye vaileant dedis of Hengist schawin in Almany, causit ane
multitude of pepil to cum in Britane of greter noumer than before with co^monis,
wiffis and childrin to inhabit ye land. Throw quhais cumyng Hengist grew of sic
pissance that the Britonis were of na power in co^pair of Saxonis in Britane.
Hengist seand Uortigern put fra ye crown and banist i^ walis, thocht best to
stable the crown to him. And set ane conuentioun of Saxonis in London and maid
him self king. Syne co^mandit the cuntre neuir to be callit in times cu^yng ye
realm of Britonis, bot ye realm of saxonis. And so ye realm was callit Hengist
land. And the pepill Hengistmen. Bot now be corruptioun of langage the realm
is callit England, and ye pepill Inglishmen. Be this samyn decreit was
co^mandit yt na Britonis should be found out of Walis within.xx. dayis eftir the
proclamatioun under the pane of deith. Siclik yt na man should leif of ye faith
of Crist, or to do any cerymoneis after the rite of crystyn pepyll under ye
samin pane. The day byrun great murdir and punicioun was maid on al yame y^ war
repugnant to this proclamation. The p^latis war slane at ye alter, the kirkis
brint. And as Bede sayis both ye publict and private housis war bet down to
the ground be tyranuy of Saxonis. And it yair was ane other thing mair
miserabyl to yame than al their calamiteis. Sa far enragit ye cruelteis of
Saxonis yt na men durst bury ye cristin pepil. Money miserabil britonis war
takin in ye montanis seikand their fude, and but ransoun, favor, or mercy
slane* Otheris fled out of the cuntre, otheris baid still in Britane amang the
desertis and montanis of the samyn ay in feir of their ennymes.

How Vortigern demandit the prophet Marlyne of the end of his life. and of
Marlynis answer. How Ambrose and Vter come in Vvalis and brint Vortigern
with his son and riches. Ca. xix.
ALs sone as the Saxonis had conquest Britane on this manner, they garnyst the
strenthis thairof in all pertis with men, munition, and vittallis, and vsit the
cursit ritis of paganis, aberand fra ye cristin faith and makand odoratioun to
ydolis, as As they were institute in yair first errouris. Throw quhilkis the
kirkis sum time had in reverence amang cristin pepill with the blude of yair
cursyt sacrifice were defowlit. And that their ennymes should not inuaid thaym
vnprouisitlie, they laid ane stra^g garrison of armit men for^ens the bordouris
in all partis of their realm. And brocht ilk day new pepil out of Almany to
expel ye Scotts and Pychtis out of ye landis yt lay betuix Hu^bir and Tyne.
Uortigern spuleit of his croun, and seeing his ennymes multiply both at hame
and on field and siclik the saxonis and franche men haitit him na les than
britonis was sa disparit for his corruppit life yat he beleuit na support of
god nor it of other mortale creaturis to recover his realm. And thairfore he
set his ingyne to haif knawlege of thingis to cum be response of prophettis as
is the use of disparit pepill in extreme dangeir but refuge. Incontine^t he
brocht before him ane prophet namyt Merlyne. And inquirit him quhat should be the
end of his empire and life. This Merlyne was gottin (as the fame was) be
conmixtion of ane devil in form of man with ane lady of Britane. And was
lernit be wichecraft to raise wekit spretis to his familiar co^monyng. And be
yir narrationis knew money thingis to cum. Als sone as vortigern had brocht yis
Merlyne before him, he inquirit quhat should be the end of his weres Or gyf he
mycht recover the crown of Britane. And finalie quhat should be ye end of his son
and him self. Gyf any of his blude should regne behynd him in Britane. Or gyf he
mycht have any skaith be weres of Ambrose and franchemen. Merlyne answerit
pertlie to their petitionis, that both vortigern and hes childrin within schort
time should be vincust be Ambrose and Uter sonnis of Constantyne. And should be
brynt with all his treasour^ and gudis. This prophecy of Merlyne was weill
prouin in the end of his empire. For sone eftir ye said Ambrose and Uter come
out of Bertane to Walis with ane army to revenge the slauchter of king
Constantius yair brothir, quhilk was slane be dissait of the said Uortigern.
Als sone as Uortigern hard of their cuming* he assemblit ane great power hauand
na confidence in this prophecy, and come with arrayit oist aganis Ambrose and
Uter. And left behynd him his son with all his treasour in ane castle of
Walis, traistyng (gyf he should peris) mair honest to de fechta^d in battall
aganis his ennymes than any other wayis. Skarslie were the armyis Iunit, quhen
money of yame (that faucht in ye first wyng of Uortigernis army) come to
Ambrose. Thus succedit victory to Ambrose but any straik. Uortigern seeing his
army vincust Raif of hes coit armor and faucht with incredible co^stance to
that fine, that he mycht have deit amang the co^monis and escheuit ye fatal
necessite of deith, quhilk was schawin to him before be prophecy of Merlyne.
Nochtheles he was brocht out of ye field be his freindis in hope of better
fortoun to ye samyn castle quhair his son and treasoure was left before the
battall. Ambrose hauand victory on this wise, followit on Uortigern, and
beltit ye castle with stra^g sege. and howbeit he mycht not tak it haistlie, it
yt his army should nocht be in dangeir throw lang tarry he brocht money huge sillis
and treis out of the nixt wod, syne fillit the fowsis and trinchis of ye said
castle with the samyn. Eftir yis he kest birnand faggottes with great multitude
of treis within the castle. Throw quhilk the fire grew sa bald that ye
castle and all that was within it brynt and was resoluit in powdir. According
to the prophecy of Merlyne.

Of syndry illusyonis and dissaitis of the evil spretis. Ca. xx.
TO declare quhat prophet been yis merlyne gottin (as the fame was) be ye
devil, or gif sic generatioun be possible to nature of man, it pertenis litill
to ye purpos quhilk we tuke on hand. Nochtheles because we have fallin in
co^moning of sic detestable conversation of deuillis with the nature of man. We
will writ su^ thingis yat happinnit nocht lang before the making of this buke.
The eir of god.i.M.iiii.C.lxxxvi. eris. Certane marcha^dis were passand betuix
Forth and Flanderis (quhen haistelie come sic ane thud of wynd) yat sail mast
and ^aikillis were blawin in the brym s^is, throw quhilk the schip beleuit nocht
bot sicker deith. The patroun thairof astonist with sa huge and uncouth
tempestis aganis the season of ye eir because it was about sanct Barnabyis day
(quhen the seis apperis more calm than rageand) traistit ye samyn erar cumin
be illusioun of the devil the ennyme of man, than be violence of weddir. In the
mean time ye voce was hard of ane woman in the how of ye schip wariand her
self. For ye instant hou^ scho was conuersit with ane devil in image of ane
man. And schew how this devil had vsit her in yat mane^ money eris before. And
thairfore besocht ye pepill to cast her in the seis, that be her deith the
remenant pepill in the schip mycht de sauit. Than be command of ye patroun ane
priest w^t to her in ye heavy cheir. Co^mandyng her to make confessioun of her
abominable life. And to have confidence in god, be quhais mercy all synnis ar
purgit, quhen the synnar hes repentance and teris. Quhen yis woman was makand
her confessioun with great repentance to the priest in sycht of al ye pepill.
Ane ugly cloud with ane crak of fire and ^eik flew out of the schip and fell
down with ane vennomus stink in the seis. Incontinent this tempest ceissit, and
ye marcha^dis arriuit at ye port quhair they desirit but any forthir trubill.
And about yis same time happinnit sic ane like exempill in ane town of Gariach
nocht fourtene mylis fra Abirdene. Ane child of great bewte complenit to ye
bischop of Abirdene, that he was trubillit lang time be ane devil in form of
woman apperandly the fairest creature that euir he saw in his life, quhylk come
to him (quhen durris and wyndowis been closit.) Syne tistit him be voluptuous
brasing to her plesoure, and departit ay in the brekyng of ye day but any
noyis. And yocht he had assaileit money wayis to be delyuerit of her, it he
couth find na remeid. The bischop astonist of this illusion co^ma^dit these ou^g
child to resort him in su^ other placis, and to be mair fervent in fasting and
prayer than he was before. Quharthrow it mycht happin that the devil mycht be
vincust and leif him in times cumyng. And as the bischop deuysit sa it come
after to this oung child, for he was delyuerit of this illusion be ye same
manner. Nocht lang fra this time happinnit ane thing nocht unlike to ye samyn
illusioun in the land of Mar as was schawin to ws be syndry yat saw the samyn.
Ane madin of nobill blude and excellent bewte (after that scho had refusit the
marriage of money nobyll men) fell in abhominabyll conversation with ye devil.
Her freindis seeing her wamb rise, commandit her to schaw ye deflorar of her
chastity. To quhome scho answerit, yt ane lusty child (as apperit) vsit to cu^

And quhen he had red to Verbum caro factum est. The devil flew away with
horribyll cry and bure the bed and rufe of the house with him. The third day
after this woman was delyuerit of ane monstour of mair terribyll visage than
euir was seen be any pepyll before. The meidwiffes brint the samyn that it should

How Ambrose was confiderat with Scottis and Pichtis* and how he slew
Hengist and dang the Saxonis out of Britane. How his two systeris vvat mariit
on the confiderat kyngis, and of syndry haly men. Ca. xxi.
After deith of Uortigern ylk day come to Ambrosius mair confluence of pepil,
throw quhilk he had sa strange ane army that he tuke purpos to recover his
realm. And to do ye samyn mair plesandly, he gat Scottis and Pichtis (because
they had extreme hatrent aganis saxonis (co^fiderat with him. In the mean time
great nowmer of Britonis come to him quhilkis war banist before be Hengist amang
the Scottis and pichtis. Ambrose seeing ylk day sa great multitude of pepyll
cumand to him all of ane mind to recover their realm went to ane hie mote
quhare he micht be seen. And complenit the treasonabill deidis of Uortigern
aganis the house of Constantine in damage of britonis and yair common weill,
and lamentit the huge cruelte of saxonis done aganis god and man. Throw quhilk
he enflammit all the pepyl in sic desire to recouir yair lyberte, and to
revenge the iniuris done to thaym, that they with ane consent war delyuerit to
follow his baner aganis Saxonis. And to cause yair purpos to be mair stablit
they maid him king of Britane. Fra the incarnatioun of god. iiii.C.lxxxxviii.
eris. after ^ Uortigern and Uortimer his son had rong. xvii. eris in britane.
Ambrose maid king in this manner began to put his pepyl in sic ordour as he was
lernit in ye weris of France, and come forthwart with displayit baner aganis ye
saxonis. The.vi. day after met him Loath king of Pychtis and Conrannus
lieutenand to Co^gallus king of scottis with ane great army. Ambrose rycht glaid
of their cumyng ressauit yame with great beniuolence, and promittit (quhen he
micht have oportunite) to recompense yair kindness. Incontinent Ambrose rasit
his tentis and come with three battallis of Scottis Pichtis and Britonis to ane
place (...) Mahesbel. For Hengist was (...) their with ane army of Saxonis
abiding their cumyng. Quhill ye tea^is of both ye armyis war sta^dyng thus in
athir sicht, followit frequent preiking skarmussyng and syngular battallis on
athir side. Quhil at last yai iunit togidder. And quhe^ they had fochtyn lang
with vncertane victory, the pepyll of Bertane with Frenchemen fechtand aganis
the myddilward of Saxonis be new ingyne and practik of battal did yame great
trubyll. Be than the scottis and Pichtis had brokyn bath ye wingis of their
ennymes in sic manner yat ye standartis of Britonis, pichtis, and Scottis war
cumyn out throw the Saxonis and met togidder. Incontinent ye Saxonis gaif
backis. Hengist seeing na way to renew battall mon^t on his horse, and was the
last man yt fled in his army. Ambrose seeing the field discomfist followit in
may hatrent on Hengist and ran him throw the body with ane speir. The residew
of Saxonis astonist be his slauchter fled with Occa his son to the nixt
montanis. After this victory Ambrose come with his victorius army to London,
and maid all ye Saxonis and soudiouris (quhilkis war left to defend ye town) sa
affrayit quhen they hard Hengist slane and his army discomfist, yt yai oppinnit
the portis and fell on kneis petuisly desyring grace. Than Ambrose put ane
buschement of armit men to the portis, y^ na ^an should depart, quhyll he had
taken aduisement quhat was to be done. And incontinent he past to the castle.
The nobyllis (quhilkis war left to defend the samyn be Hengist) seeing him cum
with victory on this wise fell on kneis before him, and said. ye goddis hes
geuyn to ye (may inuyncybyll prince) license to punis ws at thy plesour,
because thy manheid and fortoun is inuinsibill. Nochtheles gif it be lefull to
oldin and miserabyll creaturis dei^ckit to extreme rewyne be hatrent of gods
to implore mercy and grace before ane victorius campioun (quhen life and deid is
in his handis) we lawly beseikis the for ye happy victory falling be strange
battall to the as richtuous prince of this realm, to suffir ws of thy benyng
grace to return nakit wappinles and scurgit with wandis (gyf it be thy
pleasoure) in our awin regioun. Gyf thou will condescend thairto, thou sall be
put in memory not only for may honest victory aganis sa pyssant ennymes, bot
als for thy mercy geuin to desolate pepil. Ambrose mouit be yir wordis wrocht
na iniuris on Saxonis. Bot tuk the castle and sufferit yame to pas hame with
all their guddis. Sone after be general edict al fensabyl men of Saxonis were
co^mandit to pas in Almany, bot ye remane^t baid still as labouraris of ye
ground content to pay tribute to Ambrose, and to ressaue ye cristyn faith.
After this victory al Britonis (yat war exilit in syndry partis of ye world
eschewyng the tyranny of Saxonis) returnit in britane. Tha^ king Ambrose
co^mandit al kirkis to be reparit, ye preistis and religious men to be restorit
to yair liberte and rowmes. Throw quhilk ye cristyn faith was in great
veneration throw all pertis of Britane. The ymageris of ydolis put down, and
all ydolis (quhare they war app^hendit) brokyn, and general processyon maid
syndry dayis be ye pepyl. The kirkis and housis decorit with flouris, claythis
of arres and tapestreis, and the stretis resounding with heuynly noyis and
melody in may delicius musik to ye consolation and reiosyng of pepyll. Than
Ambrose to schaw his beniuolence mair fervent to the co^fiderat pepyll, brocht
Loath king of Pichtis and Conrannus governor of scottis within London, leuand
their armyis nocht far fra ye samyn, and feistit thaym certane dayis with all
manner of da^teis that mycht be deuisit. And quhen he had rewardit thaim with
riches and Iowellis (as afferit) he commandit thaym be assent of his nobillis
to be honorit amang his pepyll, as defendouris and recoueraris of his realm.
Sic thyngis done, new peace was maid betuix thaym under their conditionis. Al
landis liand beond Hu^ber should pas in perpetual dominion of scottis and pichtis
but any clame of Britonis i^ times cumyng, and ye Saxonis to be haldyn e^nymes
to thaym both. And gif ye Saxonis returnit in any part of Albion, the Albianis
with equale mind should co^cur togidder to resist thaym. Their co^ditionis of
peace were the better kepit be affinite yt followit after. For Ambrose had two
sisteris, of quhilkis ye eldest namit Anna was maryit on Loath king of Pichtis,
and the oungest namit Ada was maryit on Conrannus to ye fine yt the Albanis
should be haldyn togidder under ane blud and amite to withstand the Saxonis. This
Ada partit with child within two eris after scho come in Scotland and
deceissit. And sa ye affinite ceissit betuix Ambrose and Conrannus, bot Anna
bure unto Loath king of pichtis three sonnis Modreid, Walwane, and Thamete, as we
sall after schaw. The britonis, scottis, and pichtis stude money eris in good
amyte and concord but any iniure of ennymes. In the mean time part of Saxonis
(quhilkes were sufferit to remane under tribute, and to tak the crystyn faith)
maid private sacrifice to ydolis, and war brynt quhe^ it was knawin. In the
samyn time Co^gallus king of scottis vexit be la^g infirmite deceissit ye.xx.
eir of his empire. and was buryit in ye abbay of Co^mekill. About this time war
money haly me^ in syndry partis of ye world as Remigius byschop of Remens,
quhilk gaif ye sacrament of bapteme to Clodouius king of France. This Clodouius
biggit ane kirk of sanct Genouefa hallowar of Paris. In yai days war amang ws
Colmane, Medane, and Modane great precheouris. Syndry Britonis were martyrit
before this time in Albion be cruelte of saxonis. Throw quhilk money of yame fled
i^ scotland, amang quhom was Patriciane ane man of singular devotion, quhilk
was eft bischop of ye I Will of Man, and deceissit i^ ye time of Co^rannus, of
quhilk salbe our nixt history. And sa endis heir the aucht buke of their
cronyklis,

Heir begynnis the nynt Buke of the croniklis of Scotland:
Of king Conrannus and how he maid lavvis to punis extorsionis. How Occa and
Passentius arriuit with new power of Saxonis in Ingland. and how they war
vincust be Ambrose. Ca. primo.
COngallus burii^ in this manner, his brodir Conrannus was maid king. For the
sonnis of Congallus war of sa tendir age they mycht nocht succeid be ye lawis
before rehersit. Yair namys were Eugenius, Conuallus and Kynuatillus and were send
to be nurist under wise preceptouris in ye I Will of Man. Conrannus eftir his
coronatioun (that na truble should rise amang his legis for ouir lang peace) went
throw all the boundis of his realm for executioun of Justice. And punist money
cryminabill personis according to their demeritis. And quhen he was passing
throw ye cuntre in this wise, he was aduertist that sindry of his co^monis were
sa oppressed be tyranny of his nobillis, yat they durst nothir co^plene nor it
follow their ^ctioun before his Justice. And thairfore, yis nobill prince to
punis sic extorsionis done to his pepill, co^mandit certane exploratouris to
pas throw al boundis of his realm, and to search (quhair any sic suspitius
personis were). Yat both their namys and (...) crymis be writtin in the kyngis
^^lls. And gif any of their personis were found criminabill eftir (quhen they were
accusit be ye kyngis aduocat) they were punist to the deith. Thus were the
co^monis money eris eftir deliuerit of all oppressioun of the nobillis. This
manner of Justice is conterfaitit it in our dayis. It is said yat Conrannus vsit
(quhen his counsall sat in any part of his realm) outhir to be p^sent, or
ellis to be i^ ane wod at his huntyng nocht far fra yame to make his officiaris
ye more auctorist. And quhen he was at hu^tis in Athole not far fra the
montanis of Granebene he slew ane heart be lang chase. And fand ane huge
multitude of serpentis in his wambe to ye great admira^io^ of pepil. For ye
hornis of ane heart ar ane singular remede aganes ye bit of serpents, and
chasis al vthir venimus beistis, Quhil sic thyngis war done in scotland Ambrose
king of Britonis fell in ane dwynand seiknes namyt the Ethik feuir. Be quhilk
his body was pinit sa but remeid of medicyne, that he mycht have na rest, and
was disparit of his life. Occa and Passentius ye sonnis of Hengist aduertist of
this infirmite falling to Ambrose, beleuit (gif he were deceissit) to recover ye
realm of Ingland, and thairfore gaderit ane huge power be support of all the
princis of Almany, and returnyt in Ingland. At yis time Uter the prince of
Walis brodi^ to ambrose was in great doloure be malady of flure with vehement
thrist and fever. Throw quhilk the Britonis was desolat (as apperit) but any
capitan^ to sustene the weris aganis the Saxonis. Nochtheles ane conuentioun
was set of the noblis to auise quhat was to be don in this may da^gerus man.
Eftir la^g consultatioun they were deuidit in sindry opinionis. Ambrose seeing be
their co^trarius vocis sa hie dangeir apperand to his realm, tuke na
solicitude of his infirmiteis. Bot causit him self to be tursit upon ane litter
betuix two great horse. Syne past forthwart aganis ye Saxonis. And send his
Ambassatouris to solist the Scottis and Pychtis his co^fiderat freindis to cum
with may deligence to that samyn effect. Bot before their cumyng the iniuris
and cruelteis of Saxonis were sa importable, yat Ambrose was co^streneit to
fecht with thaym. And youcht he was in may vneis and maledy, it he laikit na
thing that mycht pertene to ane forcy campioun or to raise the spreit of his
army to may curage. At yair first Ionyng the Britonis were sumpart put abak.
And great slauchter maid on yame. Nochtheles Ambrose traistyng na thing mair
honest yan to de (gif yat were his chance) amang his vailea^t knychtis, went
about ye army, exhortyng thaym to perseueir in ythand battall. And to remembir
quhat excellent palm of glore was abidyng thaym gyf they be force of arms
dang yair ennymes or deceissit for defense of their realm, liberte and faith.
The Britonis rasit be hic spreit and curage be his wourdis, ruschit with may
fury in battall. And finalie put their ennymes to flycht. On quhome followit
ye Britonis with lang chase, and maid great slauchter. Ambrose seeing the nycht
fast approach, inhibit the chase, and brocht his army be sound of trumpat to
his standart. Ye Britonis during the nycht, stude arrayit in battall, and on
the morrow they partit the spule thairof be rite of arms. it quhen they began
to nowmer their army, they fand mair slauchter succedyng to thaym than to
Saxonis, howbeit they had the victory. Ambrose fyndyng his army brokin in this
wise, dred (gyf he ieoperd thaym any forthir aganis Saxonis) na felicite to
follow. And thairfore skalit his army, and tuke four monethis trewis with
Saxonis. Occa aduertist that Scottis and Pychtis wald cum in support of Ambrose
send his brodir Passentius to bring ane new army out of Almany. Sum auctouris
sayis, quhen Passentius was passa^d in Almany be contrarius windis he was
dreuin in Ireland, quhair he wagit ane huge multitude of weirmen and returnit
with thaim in Britane. Occa nochtwithstandyng yis stra^g army brocht in Britane
be cumyng of his brodir, thocht ye chance of battall aganis Britonis rycht
dangerus during the empire of Ambrose. And yairfore he instruckit ane saxon
(quhilk had perfect language of Britonis) to sla Ambrose. This Saxon (yt was
subornat in hes slaucht) was ane mo^k namit Coppa. And feneit him to be ane
medcinare hauand remeid aganis all manner of infirmiteis. At last he was brocht
to the king, quhair he lay at Gowntoun. Eftir lang co^monyng he promittit to
gyf the king certane drinkis be quhilkes he should both recover his heil, and be
deliuerit of al malady. Quhen Coppa was co^mandit be ye king to make his
drynkis, he vsit not the first day bot delicious seropis maid of soft spycis
and liquouris plesand to the mouth. Throw quhilk he gat credence to use eftir
quhat drinkis ^e list. At last this Coppa watand time to poison ye king,
gadderit sindry herbs inducyng men to sleip and meddillit the Ius thairof with
vennome, of quhilkis he maid ane serop and brocht ye samyn to ye king, saying
this drink sall make the conuales, and be deliuerit of al dolorus infirmite.
Ambrose hauand na suspicion tuke ye drynk and was co^mandit be Coppa to tak
rest to that fine that the vennom mycht skail throw all ye vanis of his body.
And quhen he fand the king on sleip, he co^ma^dit ye chalmer to be kepit but
any noyis. And in ye mean time he stall away to the nixt wod. Quhare he fand
part of Saxonis waitand with swift horse to take him away. Quhen Ambrose be
unhappy sleip had skaillit the vennom throw ye vanis of his body. He gaif ane
litill sobe, and deceissit the.vii. eir of his regne. His body was buryit in
the abbay of Stenthend. quhilk was biggit be him before inmemore of ye nobill
men yat were slane be treason of Hengist.

Of great cruelteis done be Occa to Britonis. How scottis and Pychtis war
frustrat of their voyage. Of great meruelli^ seen in Albion. Of the
interpretatioun of yame be Marlyne. Ca. ii.
AMbrose deceissit (as we have schawin) the Britonis maid sa huge lament for
his deith, that ye saxonis were aduertist yairof. Occa glaid of their dolorus
cheir and knawing be deceis of Ambrose, and of ye lang infirmite falling to
king Uter na pissance in Britane to resist aganis him, tuk purpos to oppres the
Britonis (before they were assemblit) in ye may cruel manner that mycht be
deuisit. Money of the Britonis abasit be his cruelte, fled i^ Walis, Oth^res
fled in Scotland. Otheris remanit still in Britane thirlli^ to servitude and
plesour of Saxonis. In the mean time ye Scottis and Pychtis come with strange
army in Britane in support of Ambrose to expel the Saxonis out of the samyn.
Bot quhen they were aduertist of Ambrose deith, and wist not gyf he were slane be
treasoun of Saxonis or division of Britonis amang thaym self, vnknawing quha
was friend or fa, yai returnyt hame the same gait they come. At this time were
seen money uncouth meruellis in Albioun and were interpret be Merlyne to the
great terroure of pepill. Ane fiery comeit was seen with money terrible bemes. Ane
crownit dragoun was seen birnand in the lift. Grene treis tuke suddand fire and
brynt. Auld treis (that were before cuttit fra the ground) flurist and bure
leuis. The reueir of Thamys apperit bludy. Ane well sprang up in the myddis of
orke with sic haboundance of blud, that all the stretis were repleite thairof.
In Kent ane child leuch in his motheris wambe. Their meruellis be
interpretatioun of Merlyne causit the Britonis cum in battal aganis the
Saxonis. For merlyne interpreit yis comeit to king Ambrose. This crownyt
dragoun to Uter his brodir. The blude signifyit his bludy swerd aganis the
Saxonis. And ye fire signifyit ye vter exterminion of Saxonis. Uter gave sic
credence to yir interpretationis of Merlyne, that he tuke the crownyt Dragon
for his armies, and bure it birnand as gold in ane field of asure to the color
of the lift. And was callit thairfore Uter Pendragon be the pepill.

How Vter was maid king of britonis, and how he was discomfist be saxonis
and chasit in Vvalis. How saxonis and Britonis war agreit. Ca. iii.
THe nobillis of Britane tuk sic persuasion be Merlyne and his prophecy, that
they come to Uter in Walis and maid him king. Sine co^mandit the pepyll to be
reddy at ane schort day to pas on the Saxonis. King Uter (after that the
Britonis war gaderit at the day prefixit) gaif the charge of battall to
Nathaliodus ane man of vile and obscure lynnage mair for his familiarite tha^
virtew. The nobyllis of Britane tuke na little indignation that ane man nocht
perregall to thaym in lynnage nor pissance, was preferrit to thaym in honor
and dignite, and said the king was imprude^t, his empire not bea^d stabillit,
to decore ane man of small lynnage with sa hie chargis in their contemptioun.
And iugi^ thairfore, gif he had sicker peace but trubyl of ennymes, to magnifye
men of small lynnage with honors above yame. it because their co^moun weill
was approchyng to hie dangeir, they put silence to sic materis be counsall of
prudent men. Nathaliodus (nochtwithstanding the indignation of yir nobillis
aganis him) tuke peirtly ye charge, and went forthwart with proud baner aganis
saxonis. Occa aduertist be his exploratouris (quhat ye britonis intendit)
brocht forthwart his army with diligence. Followit sone ane battal richt
vnplesand to Britonis. For Gothlois prince of Cornewal impacient to suffer
Nathal^odus p^ferrit to him, cu^ out of ye field with all his oist, and left
the remanent army of Britonis reddy to ressaue ye iniure of ennymes. Thus war
the britonis fynaly discomfist. Occa (nochtwithsta^ding these discomfitour)
brocht his army be sound of trumpat to ye standert, and inhibit any ferther
chase to be maid on britonis. Traisting Gothlois fled only be slycht to inuaid
ye Saxonis, quhen he saw occasioun. Gothlois seand ye britonis put to flicht
(yt he should not be ane pray to his ennymes) fled within ye nycht ye nerrest way
he mycht i^ Cornewal. Occa on ye morrow seeing ye camp desert, understood ye
britonis war discomfist, and send ane herald to Uter, chargeing him to pas in
Walis with ye Britonis under pane of deith, and to leif Ingland (quhilk he
conquest be the swerd) to be inhibite be him and saxonis. Uter reuoluyng how
dangerus and doutsum was to renew battall aganis saxonis, and knawing his
realm bot ane facil pray to his inymes (gif they feirsly persewit) began to
detest ye damage of al weris, and a^swerit to the herald, he wald leif all
hatrent aganis ye saxonis and have peace, nocht for feir of thaym bot only to
remove trubyl, that his pepyl mycht leif in peace. And desyrit Occa (sen na
great occasion of weres was betuix him and britonis) to put fine yairto i^ time
cumyng. And forthir he wald be content ye four prudent men were chosyn on ylk
side to even all debatis betuix yame, ye britonis and saxonis micht incres
togidder under ane perpetual amite in times cumyng. Occa knawing their offeris
procedyng mair be febyll curage than any ma^heid, tuk peace with glaid cheir,
and reiosit (sen victory and chance of battall was vncertane) yt the realm of
Ingland was sa esaly conquest. After this, peace was maid in this manner, All
the landis of Ingland liand fornence ye Almane s^is sall pas in times cumyng
under the empire of Saxonis. The residew of that regioun callit Britane to
remane under the empire of Britonis, as it was before, and athir pepill to leif
under ya^r awin lawis. Throw yis peace both the pepill incressit togiddir in
polecy and riches but any iniuris of otheris. Ye Saxonis leuand on their hethin
lawis. And ye Britonis eftir ye cristin faith. it money of thaym were intricat
with Pelagius herisyis aberra^d fra the sicker faith.

How Vter slew the prince of Cornevvall* and gat Arthure on his wife. how
^oth king of pichtis clamit the crown (...) Britane. and how Britonis war
put (...) of their herisyis. How Terdix and (...) come to Occa with new
power of Saxonis* and how the saxonis vva^ vinc^st be myrakyll. Ca. iiii.
IN this time Uter king of britonis was degenerat fra virtew in may
schamefull lust. For the surfeit ydelnes and exces of plesoure regnand than
amang the Britonis was occasioun nocht only of his adultry, bot als of
slauchter. Throw quhilk succedit money terrible weris to ye great affliction of
his pepill. Schort time following Uter maid ane riatus banquet in Londoun on
uyll day. On quhilk all the nobillis of Britane with their wyffis were present.
Amang quhome was ane lady of great bewte the spous of Gothlois prince of
Cornewell. Uter rauist with bewte of this lady, send his cubicularis with rich
Iowellis to solist her to his plesour. Gothlois knawyng Uter effeminate and
desiryng to defoule his bed, fled haistelie with her to Cornewell. On quhome
Uter followit with great power, hauand na sycht to his grauiteis nor princely
estait. And finalie had this lady at his will. And gat on her ane son namit
Arthure, quhilk succedit to him, as eftir we sal schaw. Sic thingis done Uter
segit the castle, Quhair Gothlois was and slew him, eftir that the castle was
taken. Alliegeand that he fled fra Nathaliodus quhen Britonis faucht aganis the
Saxonis. Howbeit his mind was to sla this Gothlois, that he mycht reiose his
wife frelie in times cummyng. Sum men writtis that Uter was transformit be
craft of Merline in Gothlois similitude. And be that way he gat Arthur.
Nochtwithstandyng in quhat sumeuir way it was, treuth is that Uter gat him on
ane other mannis wife. Als sone as Arthure was cumyn to perfect age, Uter
gaderit all his nobillis of Britane to ane cou^sall. And causit yame to be
sworn on the euangell to suffer nane other to regne in Britane behynd him, bot
Arthure his son. Quhilk thing rasit ye Pychtis with great hatrent aganis Uter.
For Loath king of Pychtis was impacient and rycht co^mouit, that Arthure gottin
in adultrye should be preferrit to his childrin gottin in lauchfull bed, and Just
heritouris of the crown of britane. Nochtheles quhen this king Loath of Pychtis
had assaileit lang to brek Uter of his mind, and mycht na wayis do the samyn,
he supersedit all his purpos quhill he saw the seasoun more expedient. Money of
the Britonis be frequent conuentioun with Saxonis left the rycht faith, and
maid adoratioun to ydolis. Utheris followit the errouris of Pelagius, and set
thaim to distroy the cristin faith in Britane. Throw quhilk their errouris were
sa great, that baptysme was inhibit with money other artikilles of ye faith. The
prelatis of Britane haua^d great displeseir, yt yir errouris were sprung sa hie
amang yair pepill, brocht sa^ct Germane and sanct Seueir in Britane. Quhilkis
finalie be haly life and continewall precheyng kythit money mirakillis. And maid
the Britonis to be penitent of yair errouris and to return to ye true faith of
Crist. Their haly men also purchest license at Occa to preche amang the Saxonis.
Sic thingis done in Britane, arriuit in Ingland two nobill men namit Tardix and
kenrik with new armyis of Saxonis. And al yir saxonis were plesandlie ressauit
be Occa. Bot Kentik was ane scharp persew ar of cristin men. And was slane
eftir be the co^monis of Ingland, because he gart sanct Germane ly yair out in
ane evil nycht. The cumyng of their Saxonis in Ingland were rycht suspicious to
king Uter. And maid him believe that Occa was irkit of peace, and seikand new
occasioun contrar the peace before contrackit to inuaid the Britonis. And yair
fore he send ane herald till Occa exhortyng him to keip the amyte and peace
before contrackit with Britonis, and to a^stene fra all thing yat mycht gener
occasioun of discord betuix the two pepill, and to cause their Saxonis laitly
cumyn in Ingland to return in Almany. Utherwayis litill tranquillite apperis
betuix the two pepill in times cumyng. Occa thocht Uter ouir proud to desire
sic thyngis or to inhibit him to ressaue freindis (as him plesit) in Ingland.
Nochtheles he answerit that he was als weill set to keip the band betuix ye two
pepil as Uter. And did neuir (sen the peace was contrackit) iniure to Britonis.
Thus mycht the Britonis have na sufficient causis to lament. Nochtheles he
understood weil that king Uter was seikand occasioun to move weir betuix
Britonis and Saxonis co^mandyng him to ressaue na Saxonis in Ingland, bot to
send yame schamfullie agane in Almany, howbeit the Saxonis come nocht in
Ingland be command of Britonis, nor it were to depart at their pleseir. It was
thairfore to be eschewit, that Uter and his nobillis be fuliche chargis bring
nocht yame self fra sicker eyes to may dangerus fall. And sen they first socht
occasioun of battall, they should have it, quhil ane of yame were vterly
distroyit. Uter and the nobillis of Britane rycht astonist of this answer,
send their secund ambassatouris to Occa with large soumys of gold and riches to
draw his mind fra battall. Occa resauit the gold, and for contemption maid the
ambassatouris to return hame but any answer. Ye Britonis mouit with their
iniuris, and seeing na bandis nor peace mycht hald the Saxonis at freindschip,
maid their ordinance in yair best manner for battall. And beliue ye peace was
geuyn up on all sydis. Loath king of Pychtis knawyng their weris risyng betuix
Saxonis and britonis offerit him wilfully to cum with all his pepil in support
of Occa aganis ye britonis. Because thai intendit to defraud his so^nis of ye
crown of britane, quhilk pertenit to yame be just titil. And send his
ambassatouris to Conrannus king of scottis to co^cur with him to y^ samyn
effect. Bot Conrannus refusit, saying he wald nothir violat the peace maid afor
with Britonis, nor it support ye ennymes of god aganis catholic pepil. The
britonis knawing ye ordinance of pichtis and saxonis aganis yame, complenit to
their haly bischopis germane and seueir, yir bischopis co^mandit yam to
assemble yair army and commit yame to god, and gif they sa did they should not
faill to have victory of their ennymes. The britonis (howbeit they had na
little ^^ir of their Saxonis) come with their haly bischopis i^ arrayit battall.
And q^hen they were doing deuyne ser^^ce on Pasche day, tithingis come ye
saxonis and Pichtis were cumand in arrayit battall. Incontinent be command of
Uter ylk man past to his best (...)* And sanct Germane promysit (...) ^echt in
the first battall with the preistis. The saxonis and pichtis knawyng yair febyl
ordinan^e presumit not bot victory, and war thairfore the mair properant in
battal. Sanct Germane bure ye baner and exhortit the pepyl with great noyis to pas
forth wart. At the first iunyng the preistis cryit with ane hie voce. Alleluya.
And incontinent ye reflex of ye voce resoun^it agane ye rochis (quhare they
iunit) with sic preis yt yair ennymes beleuit not bot al ye montanis and
cragges were tu^bland down on yame attanis. And incontinent they fled but any

The manner of this battal and victory is rehersit at lenth be sa^ct Bid, because
it come be mirakill of sanct germane.

How Occa and Nathaliodus inuading other be battall war both slane with
xv.M. Britonis. How oung Occa was maid king of Ingland* and of his ordinance
aganis the scottis and pichtis. and how they war vincust. and kvng Vter slane
be poysoun. Ca. v.
THe britonis proud of this victory tuke na sicht to ye weil of yame self, nor
hatrent of saxonis, and gaif yame to yair auld corruppit vicis with sic riatus
surfeit. y^ yai^ spendit sumtyme two, sumtyme three dayis but interruption in
their bankettis, throw quhilk they war degenerat fra vaileant pepyll in may
schamfull drunkettis. The prelatis and other kirkmen richt sorrowful for their
vicis of yair pepyl, ceissit not co^tinewally to preche. Sayng gif yair vicius
lyuis war no^ amendit. their realm sall fall in pray to yair ennymes. And as
their haly bischoppis co^iecturit, sa followit. For Occa within schort time eft
inuadit yame be battall, and slew Nathaliodus lieutenan^ to Uter with.xv.M.
britones. Nochttheles he followit sa feirsly on ye chare yt he was slane and
money vaileant capitanis with him. The Britonis war sa brokin be this battall,
yt they ceissit in times cumyng to invade ye saxonis. After the slauchter of
Occa ye Saxonis maid Occa his brothir son king of Ingland. And because Loath
king of Pychtis supportit the britonis i^ this last battal (as certane
prisoneris of pichtis takin in ye field schew) y^ saxonis maid yair ordinance
to invade the pichtis. it dredand (ye scottis should cu^ in their support) they
brocht ane nobyl man namit Colgern with ane new power out of Almany, and
promittit (gif he distroyit ye pichtis) to geif him al ye la^dis yt the pichtis
reiosit beond Hu^ber, because ye said pichtis war co^fiderat before with yame and
contrar their bandis faucht laitly with britonis in their co^trar. Sone after
Colgern arriuit in Northumberland inuading ye cuntre with importabyll
cruelteis. The inhabitantis yairof impacie^t to sustene sa hye iniuris, faucht
aganis him with great fury, nochtheles yai war discomfist. Als sone as Occa knew
ye cumyng of Colgern, he tuk peace with britonis, and come with great army
aganis ye pichtis. This last cruelte done be Colgern in Northumberland mouit ye
confiderat kingis to cu^ with all pepil under yair empire to revenge ye samyn.
it quhe^ yair army was cumyn in sicht of e^nymes, and saw sa great multitude of
pepil aganis yame, yai were affrayit specially be rehers of britonis, quhilkis
come to their support sayng ye saxonis war of huge bodiis and stature, sa
pissant in battall yt oftymes yai put their ennymes to flicht be yair terribil
visage. Their wordis maid ye army sa astonist, ye money of yame had fled but any
tarry, war not schame co^stranit yame to abide. On ye morrow ye co^fiderat
kingis seeing yame sa abasit callit ye noblis of both ye armyis, and said to
yame in this manner* we meruel (good co^panionis) quhy our proud curage been sa
dekeyit, yt money of ow (yt ar in yis pissant army) apperis be only sicht of
your e^nimes affrayit, and sa degenerat fra ma^heid, yt e seem disparit but any
dangeir appering, for saxonis are not of sic virtew and strenth, bot other pepil
may dant yam^ be victory. e have experience yt ye said saxonis been often vincust
i^ Albion to our great triu^phe and honor. They war vincust be king Uortimer,
and chasit be him out of britane. And yai war vincust also be Ambrose, and
because they durst not meit him i^ plane battal (as apperit) they slew him be
treason, and the britonis (of quhilkis money ar now wagiouris to saxonis) hes
been often disco^fist be ow, and money eris maid tributar to ow, na thing restis
thairfore (forci ca^pionis) to make ow affrayit. Attour sen our action is just
and our aduersaris wra^gusly inuadi^g ow, how may e belief any other thing, bot
victory? Gif any effrayis ow be great magnitude and strenth of saxonis, they ar
evil Iugeis. For na pepyl ar i^ erd of mair stature or of stra^gar bodyis, than
ar the Scottis and Pichtis. And gif e be of les spreit and curage than saxonis
ar, that may be impute to nocht bot to our awin sle^th. For our bodyis ar of
na les stature and strenth than yairis. Thus should nane of ow accuse nature gif
our curage be nocht corespondent to our bodyis. And sen nature hes maid ow
strange, lusty, deliver of bodyis, and reddy to sustene all labouris, nocht
remanis bot to deuoid al schameful cowardy, following the manheid and virtew of
our eldaris, and remembering na thing may succeed mair to our schame and
damage, than to be myserably vincust, bringand our self, our wiffis, children,
and landis under servitude of ennymes. And sa far as pertenis to our deuore,
belief not bot we sall ieoperd our lyuis in defense of ow, yat our ennymes may
understand quhidder ye noblis of scottis and pichtes ar mouitmair to scham or
dredour, to defend yair realm in extreme da^geir. Be their words ye army was
infla^mit with birna^d desire to fecht. Money of yir capitanes schew yam neuir
of purpos to fle nor it to do any thing co^r^ar ye mind of yair prince. Skarsly
war their wordis said, quhe^ both ye armyis iuni^ and faucht with incredibyll
hatrent and doutsum victory. Bot at last ye co^fiderat pepil ouirset with
multitude of ennymes gaif bakkis, on quhom followit the saxonis inuading yame
with ythand slauchter, quhill ye nycht put end thairto. On the morrow ye king
of Scottis with ye residew of his army returnit in Galloway, and the king of
Pichtis in Pentland. After this victory Occa slew all the scottis and pichtis
found betuix Tyne and Tweid, and garnist all the strenthis thairof with strange
munitioun and wageoures, and maid Colgern prince of Northumberland to defend ye
samyn aganis all inuasouris. After this victory of scottis and Pychtis, king
Occa come with his victorius army aganes ye britonis, because they supportit ye
scottis and pichtis contrar yair band. and schortly dang thaym (...) of Ingland
in Walis, and repa^^^ the strenthis in all partis of Ingland, sumtime maka^d
scarmussing on Britonis, Scottis and Pichtis, to cause the pepyll understand,
that they mycht nocht leif but exercition of weris. King Uter about this time
fe^l in ane fever and desyrit ane of his seruandis to bring him ane drink of
clear watter fra the nixt fo^tane to slokin his vehement thrist. And
incontinent ane saxone instruckit to the same effect gave him ane drynk
enuenomit with poison. And sone after he deceissit in the.xviii. eir of his

Of the Roman Boece and of his vverkis and martyrdom. Of the institutionis of
the ordour of sanct Benedict* and how super^levv rentis makis evil religious

IN their dayis was Boere the Roman senatoure rycht expert in Theology,
Philosophy, Mathematik, and syndry other science. He wrate excellent werkis of
the Trinite. And siclik of Logik, Rethorik, Geomatry, Arsmetrik Musik, and
Astronomy sa profoundly, that his werkis ar it in great admiration to all
pepyll. At last he was slane at Reue^na be Theodorik king of Ostrogotis, with
money other haly men. For they wald not applaude to the herisy of Arrius, bot
this cruelte was nocht lang vnpunist be Justice of god. For this Theodorik
deceissit sone eft miserably, and the name of Gothis put out of memory. And ye
said Boece with his fallowis e^kit to ye nowmer of sanctis. In yir days was
sanct Benedict quhilk institute ye ordour of monkis, yocht it was begun before
be Basilius in the orient. And because he was irkit with frequent cu^pany of
pepil, he come to Cassinu^ quhate he tra^slatit ye tempyll of Appollo i^ ane

abbayis of this ordoure with men of great devotion, howbeit yai wald have been
mair religious and deuot, gif yai had been do^at with les magnificence of
princes. for ye superflew rentis of yir abbayis geuyn be magnificence of
princis inducis religious men mair to sleuth and sensual lustis than to any
fervent devotion. This Bn^dict deceissit at Cassinu^ fra ye
incarnation.v.c.xviii. eris* quhate he is buryit with Scolastica his sister in
ye time of Iustyne empriour. and at this time Brigida the haly virgin haua^d

kirkis in this regioun. Scho deceissit in the.xviii. eris of Conrannus, and was
buryit in Ireland i^ ane town namit Dune. Howbeit sum of the Scottis haldis

quhilkis fled in France with his brethir and sisteris to eschew the cruelte of
Saxonis, and was after bischop of Remens, quhare he kithit syndry myrakyllis.
And in this time was institut the processioun of the gang dayis in France three
dayis before the Ascension day be Mamercius byschop of Ueen. And it was ressauit
in Scotland be Conuellanus abbot of Colmekyll. This Conuellanus was ane
prophet, and schew money thyngis to cum concerning ye exterminion of Pichtis

war to be conuertit to sicker faith. He schew als great calamite to fall to ye
nobillis of Albion, bot gif yai haistely amendit their corruppit life. This
Conuellanus was in the time of Arthure, quhilk was king of Britonis after deith
of Uter. Quhil sic thingis were done amang ye Scottis, Loath king of Pichtis send
his ambassatouris to Britonis clamand the crown of Britane be the lawis vsit
in Albion quhen any man marijt ane virgin, his children should succeid to the
heritage that micht justly pertene to her. And because he marijt Anna ye sister
of Ambrose and Uter (quhilkis war deceissit but lawful ayris) he alliegit ye
Modred and Wall wan hes so^nis gottin on Anna should succeid be just tytyl to the
crown of Britane. Nochtheles ye ambassatouris war depeschit be the Britonis
with displesand answer and gat na thing of their desiris.

How the Saxonis war sindry times vincust and maid tributaris to king
Arthure. How Occa arriuit with new power in Northumberland and chasit
Arthure in Vvali^. How ye surfeit cheir of ule was evil institute. How
Pychtis and Britonis vva^ agre^t. Ca. vii.
SChort time after king Arthure gadderit ane army of Brytonis, and faucht
aganis the saxonis nocht x. mylis fra London, and dantit yame with sa huge
victory that they war maid tributar, and thirllit to servitude vnd his empire.
The britonis proud of this victory come to London, quhare they remanit syndry
monethis makand their ordinance aganis the saxonis dwelland beond Humbir,
quhilkis war confiderat that time with Pichtis, and all iniuris redressit on al
sydis. king Arthure cuma^d on this manner to ork arrayit his army, and maid ye
prince of bertane his lieutenand to fecht aganis the Pichtis, for he was cumyn
before with ane great power out of the samyn to his support. The battallis fynaly
being arrayit with may awful ordinance iunit togidder, and faucht with
vncredibill hatrent. Quhil at last both the Pichtis and Saxonis were
discomfist, on quhome followit the britonis inuadyng yame with co^tinew all
slauchter, quhil yai come to ork quhair money of thaim were ressauit. Arthure
haua^d sa frequent victory on Saxonis laid ane sege about ork. And quhen he
had been three monethis at the samyn and it reddy to be ra^derit for laik of
vittallis, he was aduertist yat Occa (quhilk was chasit before in Almany) was
returnit in Northumberland with new power of Saxonis. and colleck^^ ye Pychtis
agane to him with mair ardent fury of battall than before. And because he
understood sa great nowmer of fayis reddy to inuaid him, he left ye sege
forsaid, and fled with his army in Walis, leuand behynd him Hoell duke of
Bertane with ane pert of his army to withstand his ennymes during the winter
seasoun. Schort time eftir he returnit to London to d^nt the fury of Saxonis
Quhilkis were cumyn in Kent and otheris regionis their about. And vsit sic
liberalite to win the favor of his pepill, that sumtyme he laikit money to
his necessare use. In the nixt symer he rasit his camp and come forthwart
aganis Colgern and Occa quhilkis were maka^d great heirschippis in sindry partis
of his realm. And finalie he dantit thaym with sindry victoryis. And tuke ork
the third day eftir his returnyng be treason of ane Briton, quhilk was h^ldin
for ane Saxon in the town. Be quhome he brocht great nowmer of Britonis within
ye said town under ^ycht sa quietly, that it was taken and all ye sodiouris
yairof cruelly slane. The remanent pepill were sauit be his mercy. The nixt
symer ouirpast ^e frequent skarmussyng betuix the Saxonis in Northumbirland and
the Britonis in ork. Yis ciete was rycht populus all the nixt winter with money
nobillis and co^monis of britane. Quhilkis were geuin to yair lust, sleip,
riatus bankettis and sensualite, confidyng more in their victory bygane, than
in their present strenth. It is said ye surfeit cheir (that is vsit it amang
Inglismen and Scottis.xiii. dayis togiddir eftir Cristinmes) was institute that
time be king Arthure. Nochtheles how ever yat schamfull glutony first began, it
has corruppit sa ye ingyne of Inglismen and Scottis, that in the dayis of
Cristis natiuite, they arre mair geuin to voracite yan virtew* and more to
their wambe, than to deuyne service. Throw quhilk that solemn feist sum time
had in sic deuotioun and reverence amang our anciant faderis, is sa corruppit
that it is like unto the feistis of Gentilis maid in honor of Bachus Flora and
Priapus. Quhilkis were deuisit more for ye lust and plesouris of men and women,
than any good religioun. In the nixt symer (quhen Arthure was cumyn to Humbir to
inuaid the saxonis) he fand his army sa effeminat and soft, that they were nocht
able to sustene laubour nor siclik weirly besines as they were before. Throw
quhilk money eris eftir they did lytill displeseir to yair ennymes. And had na
esperance of victory, quhil Loath king of Pychtis was confiderat with king
Arthure in this manner. That Arthure should reiose the croun of Britane during his
life. And eftir his deith the sonnis of Loath sall succeid. The Pichtis to
concur with Britonis aganis saxonis in times cumyng. And al landis (quhilkis ye
pichtis micht co^ques beond Hu^bir) to pas vnd yair dominion. Attoure Modred
king Lothis son sal mary ye docht of Gawolane gretest prince under ye king of
Britane, and ye childrin gottin betuix yame to be nurist with their good schyr
Gawolane. And yat Gawane brothir to Modred sall remane in continewall resydence
with king Arthure to be tretit according to his estait.

How the Scottis and Pychtis war confiderat with king Arthure aganis the
saxonis. How the saxonis war vincust be the Albianis, and doung out of
Albion. Ca. viii.
THe peace roborat in manner before rehersit, king Arthur desyring to banis
cristis ennymes out of Albion, solistit the confiderat kyngis to cum at ane
prefixed day to concur with him for defense of cristin faith. Quhilk day the
Britonis Scottis and Pychtis conuenit togidder under ane mind and purpos. King
Occa aduertist heirof rasit his ca^pe, and met the Albianis in his may cruel
wise. Quhen the battalles war arrayit on athir side, Colgern prince of ye
Saxonis in Northumberland come on ane sweift geldyng to the Pychtis, repreuand
thaym of their unfaithful mind considering they ressauit the pepyll in
frendschip and kindness, quhilk war laitly yair deidly ennymes, and bure armor
aganis their ancia^t freindis lang before with thaym confiderat. And it gyf they
pas forthwart that day to support the Britonis, they sal have sum experience
quhidder their awin falset, or the faith of saxonis war may abyll to have
victory. The Pychtis na thing mouit with yir wordis, displayit their baner and
faucht with incredibyll hatrent aganis ye Saxonis. Followit ane terribyl
bergane for the Scottis (y^ faucht in the richt wing) slew Childrik cheiftane
of saxonis fornentis thaym, and put yat battal to flicht. Colgern (quhilk
faucht in ye left wyng aganis ye pichtis) richt desirus to conques glore,
ruschit sa fei^sly aganis Loath king of pichtis yt he dang Loath from his horse.
Nochtheles Loath was reskewit be the Pichtis, and Colgern inuadit be yame sa
cruelly. that he was brocht with speris to the ground and slane. The myddyl
ward seeing both their wingis discomfist gaif backis. On quhome the Britonis
followit with lang chase and murdir. Occa evil wou^dit fled out of ye field
amang ye horsemen. And quhe^ he saw na place sicker to his defense, he gat ane
schip and fled in Almany. The remane^t Saxonis brokin with this slauchter, and
seeing na rescous randerit thaym to king Arthure under their co^ditionis, they
sall ressaue ye faith of Crist and leave as tributar under him. And geif yir
co^ditio^is war not acceppit, to leif yair wappynnis and guddis behynd yame,
and depart of ye cuntre within ane certane day. Sa money of Saxonis (as micht
get schippis before ye said day) fled in Almany. And quhen ye Almanis saw yame
return with sic misery and trubyll, they maid their solemn aithis to revenge
the schamful eiectioun of thaym out of Britane, quhe^ euir they mycht have
sufficient oportunite. Part of saxonis feneit yame to take the faith abidyng
ane better fortoun, and otheris war slane because they wald nocht renunce their
ydolatrie.

How the Scottis and pichtis come with.xx. thousand men in support of king
Arthure aganis Saxonis. and how the saxonis war discomfist. Ca. ix.
QUhill the Saxonis war banist and thirl^i^ to servitude on this manner, king
Arthur set him to repare ye kyrkis and all enormiteis done in ork. For the
Saxonis wrocht in it great cruelteis. In ye eir followyng he was aduertist, yat
the Saxonis (that inhabit the I Will of Wicht) with otheris of Kent war assemblit
togidder makand great cruelteis and heirschippis in ye britonis landis. To
repres their attemptatis, Arthure went with ane great power to London. And to
bring his purpos to ane better fine, he solistit Eugenius the son of
Congallus before rehersit, and Modred son to Loath to cum with.xx. M. Scottis
and Pichtis to his support. Arthur knawyng (...) great damage that come to his
^epyll in time bypast be riatus and surfeit cheir maid him to withstand their
insolence, yat na occasion should appeir to effeminat his army. With in schort
time after he tuke ye image of the blissit virgyne Mary to his ansene, and went
forthwart in hope of victory. Modred and his good fader Gawolane richt desyrus
to win honor went before the army of Britonis with.v.M. horsemen. The saxonis
knawyng Arthur within four mylis to their camp. send their ambassatouris
desyring him to pas n^ forther, and to geif thaym license to pas out of Albion
with yair guddis but iniure of Britonis. Als sone as Arthure had condiscendit
to their petitio^is, they desyrit.iii. days tre^is, bot that was denyit be
Arthure. For he tra^s^it (as was prouin after) sum hyd treason under yair
desires. Noch^theles he promyttit to pas lytill forthir for ye day. The
Britonis bean^ aduysit, quhat should be done in this matter, and beleuand na thing
les than treason, The Saxonis set on Modred and Gawolane, because they war
certane mylis fra king Arthuris camp, and slew ane great nowmer thairof, and
the remanent chasit to y^ tentis of Britonis. Arthure incontinent callit before
him ye ambassatouris of saxonis, and said he wald nothir heir their desyris in
times cumyng, nor it have peace with yame during his life. Because they
treasonabylly inuadit his pepyl under co^monyng of peace. Skarsly war their
wordis said, quhen.xl. of ye nobyllest men amang Saxonis come to the king to
excuse the treason recently committit. Saying it was done be oung men but
advise of their nobillis. Arthure presumand na les treason under this last
message tha^ under the first, commandit thaym to remane still in his camp with
ye first messingeris. Syne rasit his army within ye nicht, and come arrayit
with three battallis on ye Saxonis, or they war aduertist of his cumyng. The
saxonis war gretu^ly affrayit, knawyng nothir quhat was to be done, nor it
quhat was answerit to their ambassatouris. In the mean time Modred and Gawolane
inuadit yame with sa properant diligence, y^ money of thaym war discomfist or
they mycht cu^ to array. On quhom followi^ Arthure with sic rageand fury, that
nane of yame war saiffit quhare ya^ mycht be taken. Throw quhilk nocht was hard
bot ru^missing of d^and pepyll in all partis thairabout. The camp repleit with
deid carionis, and the ^ludis rynnand with bludy s^remes to the seyis. In this
battal wa^ slane s^ huge nowmer of Saxonis* that apperandly they mycht neuir
recover ye damage thairof. Nor it have pissance to resist the Britonis in
times cumyng. Thus were the Saxonis thirlit to more servitude than before, bot ye
nobillis were licent to pas in Almany, the Scottis and Pichtis abaid certane
dayis in Lo^doun. And returnyt hame richely rewardit be king Arthure but
displeseir in their weris.

How Tonset chancellar of Scotland vva^ slane for his vvrangus administration
of Justice. Of king Conrannus deith. Of Iustiniane empriour* and of his prudent
constitutionis fame and cheualry and of syndry captiuite^s of Rome. Ca. x.
SIc thingis done in Britane be Arthure, the realm of Scottis was gouernit in
great felicite and Justice be king Conrannus, Quhil at last be damage of his
lang age syndry displesouris followit in his realm. Their was ane man of pure
lynnage namit Tonset and was maid chancellar be king Conrannus, bot he was mair
set for the kingis proffet, than any Justice, geuand his mind and hale industry
to punys men be extreme rigor, to conques money to the king. Conra^nus (as
the ingyne of syndry kyngis ar) had thaym in may favor and reverence, that
couth may craftily escheit the guddis of ye pepyl to his proffet. Tonset
after syndry wrangis and oppressionis done be him in ye kyngis auctoryte,
callit before him certane merchandis of Fores i^ Murray, and for small or vane
causis put thaym to deith (as misdoaris) syne confiscat their guddis to the
kingis b^huffe. The nobyllis of Murray co^mouit for their oppressyonis done to
their freindis the marcha^tis foresaid ruschit haistely to harnes, and slew
this Tonset i^ plane judgment* quhare he was doing mair iniure than Justice to
the pepyll. The skryrais after his slauchter, and maid their men to be serchit
with may diligence. And they as disparit men fled to the montanis traistyng
na grace nor remeid, bot gyf they did sum gretar cruelte to redeem ye first, as
it is the commoun opinioun it in our dayis. And thairfore concludit to sla the
king, and deliver the pepyll of all extorsioun done be him. Quharethrow they
mycht conques the favor of the commonis, and be restorit to their peace.
Schort time after Donald capitane of Athole, richt familiar with the king, and
knawyng this conspiratioun send his secret servant to cause their lymmaris to cum
to Inuerloch, quhare ye king was resident for that time, and promyttit thaym
support to accomplis yair intent. And fynaly ressauit yame with great humanite,
and inclusit yame with their swerdis and wappinnis in ane secret chalmer
quhare the king vsyt to be solitar. Syne departit out of the town as he had
knawin na thing thairof. The king at last enterit in ye chalmer quhare yir
lymmaris war, waitand for his slauchter. Als sone as he saw thaym* he fell down
on his kneis and desyri^ grace. Nochtheles yir limmaris but any myseratioun
slew him in the.xxxv. eir of his regne. Quhilk was in the.xvi. eir of the

Incarnatioun.v. hundredth.xxxv. eris. His body was brocht to Colmekyll, and
buryit amang the anciant sepulturis of his forebeares. This Justinian was ane
of ye nobyl empriouris that was before his dayis. For he causit the Roman lawis
and constitutionis to be colleckit togidder with sic reason and eloquence, that
the fame is in great admiratioun to all pepyll. This Iustiniane pecifyit money
landis pertenyng to Roman empire, for he delyuerit Affrik fra Uandallis, Italy
fra the Gothis, and Dalmasia fra the tyranny of Mundus be cheualry of ane richt
vaileant capitane callit Bellisar. He delyuerit Rome fra the tyranny of
Theodorik king of Ostrogothis. After yat it was segit money eris, this Bellisar
faucht money strange battallis for defense of Rome aganis Totylla king of Gothis.
Bot at last this Bellisar fell in great infirmite, and sa Rome was fynaly taken
be the said (...) king of Gothis, the wallis and (...) bet to the ground with
the capitol^ and money other housis private and publik on the same manner, and all
the ci^tezanis thairof slane, to be ane p^rpetua^l memory to all pe^yll. How
lytyl confidence should be had in felicite of man. Rome was distroyit in this
manner, fra the Incarnatioun.v.C.l. eris. It was taken first be the Gawlis brint
and distroyit, quhen it began first to fluris, and not lang after it was
distroyit be Alarik king of Gothis. And on ye same manner it was taken be
Athalphus quhilk rang after ^larik. And sone after it was taken agane be
Gensiricus king of Uandalis, and put to na les rewyne than Cartage was before be
Romany. This town (quhilk been decorit with sa money vaileant deidis, the
dantar of al pepyl, sa often taken be ba^bar pepyll) schawis weill na thing
sycker, bot fragyll and mortal in this world. Bot we will return to our
history quhare we left.

Of king Eugenius the third, and his lavvis. Of Conrannus wife. How scho^led
with her so^nis in Ingland. Of king Arthuris fame, cheualry, and round
t^^byll. How the Britonis contra^ their ^mis maid Constantine prince of
Britane. Ca. xi.
COnrannus slane (as said is) Eugenius ye son of Congallus was maid king.
Money freindis of Courannus gaif him cou^sall in the beginning of his empire to
punis the slauchter of his eme, yt otheris mycht tak example in times cumyng to
sla ane king. Eugenius na thing mouit of their counsal not only left the
slayaris of him vnpunist, bot als put thaym on his secret counsall. And
thairfore he was suspeckit of his faderis slauchter. Conrannus wife suspeck and
him on ye samyn manner, fled with her children Regiman and Aydane in Ireland,
quhare scho remanit certane eris. And deceissi^ with her first son Regima^.
Bot Aidane remanit with the king of Ireland weill tretit money eris after. King
Eugenius (to schaw him plesand in ye beginning of his empire) sat oftimes in
judgment, to cause him appeir benign to the pepyll. And quhare any personis
war condampnit wranguislye, he gaif thaym license to appeill to his other
Iugis. He supportit the indegent pepyll with the commoun good quhen they had na
guddis to follow their action. Be this law he commandit that na man call ane
pupyll in judgment before his lauchfull age. And na wedow to be drawin ane mile
fra her dwelling place to Judgment. He maid als great punition on theuis and
ressettouris, and kepit good peace with Pichtis and britonis his nychtbouris.
Sum auctouris writtis y^ Arthure in their dayis dantit Scotland, Iseland,
Orknay, De^mark, Swethrik, Spruse, ela^d, Gotla^d, Holla^d, Braband, Flanderis,
Picarde, Normandy, Bertane, and all France. And maid al ye pepil yairof
tributar to hes empire. And elikwyse he subdewit all Greece, Peirse, Araby,
Egypt, Affrik, and Spane. And finalie vincust Lucius Roman emprioure be
singular battall. This history sall have faith with thaym that are anctouris
thairof. For we know ferme lie that Arthure deceissit in the time of Iustiniane
emprioure. Quhen ye Gothis, Burgundianis, Uandalis, and all other nationis
inuadit ye roman empire. And thairfore it is not apperand (sen sa money sindry
pepill maid diverse weiris amang thaym self that time) that they micht be
gaderit under ane mind to fecht aganis Arthure. Attoure their was at yis time
may horrible weris betuix Gothis and Francheme^. And ye historicianis that
wrait their weris maid na mentioun of Arthure. Nochtheles sen we are set to
mynnis na mannis honor nor fame, we find that Arthure was in glore of marcial
dedis na les vaileant than any other princis of Britane. And ^ikit his realm
equaly in polecy and riches. It is writtin that Arthure tuke great delectatioun
in werslyng of strange kempis, hauand yame in sic familiarite, yat quhen he vsit
to dyne or tak consultatioun in his weris, he gart thaym sit down with him in
manner of ane round crown, ye nane of yame should be preferrit till otheris in
digni^e. For quhilkis his seit was callit the round tabil. And youcht his
vaileant dedis were worthy to have memory. it the vulgar fabillis (quhilkis ar
feneit of the samyn) hes violat their fame and makis thaym to have the les
credence. The Britonis insolent be lang peace under ye empire of Arthure were
penitent of the contract maid before with Loath king of Pychtis, think and nocht
profitabill for their weill yat uncouth blud should regne above thaim. And
desyri^ king Arthure to schaw to thaym (quhom he thocht may abill) to
succeid. Arthure bad thaym cheis ane be their general vo^is yat were wise and
discendyng of the blude riall o^ Britane. And they bot more delay namit
Constantyne ye son of Cadorus prince of Cornewell quhil^* was admittit be
Arthure, and declarit prince of Britane. Nocht that he was than king bot Just
heritour^ to succeid eftir his deith. Throw quhilk it come in use that the
eldest son of kyngis were callit prince of the realm. Constantyne declarit
prince in this manner, apperit be money evident signs wise and gracious to ye
pepill and conquest ane good name amang the Britonis.

Of the message send be Pichtis to Britonis, and of their answer* how king
Arthure was slane with money of all the nobyllis of Brytane be Scottis and
Pychtis. How Guanora his wife was brocht in Angus* of her sepulture* and of
the ca^amyte that fell to Albianis be this battal. Ca. xii.
AT this time deceissit Loath king of pichtis. Be quhom ye landis that was before
namit Pentla^d were namit Lowthiane. Eftir his deith modrede king of Pychtis
send his ambassatouris to king Arthur and to the nobillis of Britane, saying it
was nocht semyng to princis to violat yair faith and band but interuentioun of
sum leifful cause. The band maid betuix him and king Arthure was nocht unknown
to thaym. Be quhilk it hes ratifyit, that nane should regne behynd Arthure in
Britane bot ye sonnis of Loath and Anna his wife and ye heritouris discendyng of
their successioun. And because the ^ame was, that Constantyne prince ^ Cornewell
was namit be thaym ^o succeid to ye crown of Britane co^trar their band and
faith before contrackit, he requirit king Arthure to gyf na aduertence to the
iniust persuasioun of his pepil, quhilk hes na respect to religion nor picte,
bot only to cause him distroy both ye law of god and man. And thairfore
prayit him to perseueir in ye band before co^trackit, that na punition cum on
his pepil be Justice of god for violation of his faith and promys. It was
answerit be ye nobillis of Britane, yat ye band betuix Arthure and Loath was
maid bot during the langar leiffar of thaym two. And sen Loath was deceissit, ye
band was dissoluit i^ ye self. Attoure they violat nocht yair faith (howbeit
they maid Constantine ane nobill man of the blud riall of Britane to be yair
price) because na thing semyt kingis mair, than to keip yair realm be
providence and wisdom, that it come nocht under the empire of uncouth blude.
Attour it was suspitius ye britonis should cu^ under dominion of pichtis* sen yai
been ay their auld ennymes. This answer rehersit to the pichtis maid yame to
detest the treason of Britonis, and to be penitent yt they supportit yame in
subdewyng of saxonis. Nochtheles yai tuke consultation quhat was best to be
done. And fynaly with ane consent concludit to invade the Britonis, and to
bring in their contrar all pepyll ye war yair ennymes. it before they attempt
this matter, they thocht it ganand to assail ye mind of scottis and Saxonis,
and fand thaym reddy to assist to yame in peace or weir. Eugenius grantit the
mair plesandly to their petitionis, yat the Britonis ressaui^ all the rebellis
of his realm. Arthure seand the peace geuyn up betuix him and the pychtis,
garnyst all ye strenthis of his realm. Syne come with aue huge pepyll aganis
the Scottis and pichtis. Traisting (howbeit the saxonis returnit in Britane)
they should be esaly vincust, sen they war sa often brokyn and discomfist with his
weris. Nochtheles ane strange army of Scottis and pichtis war assemblit before
his cumyng at Humber, as in that place quhare yai ben ay may fortunat to win)
quhen the battallis war arrayit in otheris sycht, the bischoppis and prelatis
of Scottis, Pichtis, and Britonis come (as mediatouris) desyryng thaym to
remember how dangerus it war to their commoun weill and unnatural to perseueir
in battall, sen they war ordanit be nature to leif togidder within yat I Will, and
debait yame fra invasion of other strange pepyl. Attoure their civil battallis
and contentionis amang thaym self should be occasion to saxonis to return in
Albion. For they reiose in na thing mair, than in subuersioun of Albianis.
Modred and Eugenius mouit be deuote wordis of their prelatis condiscendit to put
ane end to all their weris, gyf the Britonis wald stand at ye band before
contrackit. The bischoppis with this answer went to Arthure and brocht his mind
to peace. Bot ye freindis of Constantyne war nocht only repugnant to their
petitionis. Bot als gaif vnplesand wordis, and said because the confiderat
kingis denuncit first weris to Arthure, it was nocht his honor to desist
thairfra. Als it was bot folly to thaym to persuaid peace, quhen the army is war
arrayit in otheris sicht, bot gif it war to wirk sum prodition under color of
peace. Skarsly war their wordis said, quhen huge noyis and clamoure raise on all
sydis. And sone after both ye armyis iunit with mair cruelte than euir was
hard in any world before. The place (quhare they iunit) was full of mos and
marces, and sa vnplesand to Britonis yt they mycht nocht weilde their ordinance
and wappynnis as they desyrit. Throw quhilk the battall was prolongit, and sa
huge multitude of pepyll slane, that the river of Humber ran full of bludy
stremys to the seyis. Quhill the armyis war fechtand in may raige on this
manner, ane of the Pichtis instruckit for the nanys cryit with schyll voce fle
fle. Arthure is slane with all the nobilite of Britonis. This cry rasit the
Scottis and Pychtis with mair spreit than before. And maid the Britonis sa
astonist, that na auctorite nor sound of trumpat mycht garre thaym tarry. Bot
haistely left their wappynnis and fled to their best refuge. In this sorrowful
battall was slane of Scottis and Pichtis twenty thousand with Modrede king of
Pychtis and all the noblis of both their realmys slane. Of Britonis and
Bertona^is (that come to their support) thritty thousand. Amang all otheris was
slane king Arthure and Walwane bruthir to Modrede king of Pychtis. Quhilk
faucht that day for lu^le of king Arthure aganis his natural bruthir. On the
morrow all the spule of king Arthuris camp was partit amang the confyderat
pepyll be ryte of armies. Guanora the queen of Brytane and spouse of king
Arthure was taken with money ladyis and knychtis dependyng on her for the time.
The horse, riches, and cofferis gottin with her, fell in pray to the Scottis.
Bot her self, her ladyis and knychtis* fell to the Pychtis, and was brocht in
Angus to ane castle callit Dunbarre. Of quhilk na thing remanis now bot the
prent of the wallis quhare they leiffit the remanent dayis of their life. In
memory heirof in Megyle ane town of Angus ten mile fra Dunde, a^ money anciant
sepulturis had in great reverence of pepyll. And specially the Sepulture of
Guanora. As the title wryttyn thairapon schawis. All women (that strampis on
this Sepulture) sall be ay barrant but any fruit of their wamb, Syclyke as
Guanora was. And quhydder that this be of verite or nocht latte thaym schawe
that hes experience thairof. Bot ane thing we know. All women abhorris to
strampe on that sepulture. It is said be Gal fride writare of ye history of
Britane, that Modrede and Arthure faucht nocht at Humbir, bot at the town of
Gwyntoun, and come out of ye f^ild on live. And Guanora for displesei^ enterit
in religioun, quhilkis are not far discrepant fra the hystory as we have
writtin. Nochtheles we follow Ueremond Turgot and otheris money autentyke
authouris, quhilkis writis the true deidis of nobyll men but any fictioun.
Attoure quhare euir this may da^gerus battal was strikin, sic displesour come
after to ye Britons Scottis and Pichtis be huge s^auchter that money eris after
they mycht nocht recover the damage thairof.

How Constantine king of Britonis (...) the ^on^s of Modrede. of uncouth

nobyll men of hi^ realm. How Con^ta^tyne king of Britonis vva^ maid monk in
Ireland and of Eugenius deith. Ca. xiii.
THe Brytonis after this discomfitour and slauchter of king Arthure, maid
Consta^tyne (quhilk was declarit prince afor) king of Brytane. This Constantyne
(that na succession of Modrede should clame ye crown of Britane) slew the sonnis
of Modrede in presence of their mother. quhilk was douchter of Gawolane. Throw
quhilk all the successioun of Modrede fa^l^it. Their afflictionis fell on the
Albianis fra the Incarnation.v.C.xlii. eris. In the.xxiii. eir of ye empire of
Arthure. And y^.viii. eir of the regne of Eugenius. Money uncouth meruelles war
seen before this last battall in Albioun. Herbs war seen in ork full of blude.
Ane calf was found nocht far fra Camelon with two heidis, and ane lam siclik
with dowbyll nature. The son (...) mydday apperit bludy. The lift schane two
dayis co^tinewally full of sternis. The piottis and nicht crawis faucht with ye
rauynnis and maid vncredibyll slaucht on every side. Bot we will return to our
history. King Eugenius after his returnyng in Scotland, nowmerit the residew of
his army, and rewardit richely ye freindis of thaym that war slane in this
field. and to cause their vailea^t deidis remane i^ lang memory, he gaif yame
landis with syndry armies that yair posterite may understand, how they war
decorit be nobyll kings for yair vaileant and worthy deidis. Eugenius with sic
victorius and virtuous deidis conquest ane good name and was haldyn in na little
veneration amang his pepyll, and gouernit yame in times cumyng mair be
beniuolence tha^ rigor. Iurmi^ik duke of saxonis aduertist of this
intollerabyll slauchter of britonis, come with ane huge navy and pepyll in
Ingland quhare he with small labor subdew it king Constantyne, and chasit him
with ye remane^t britonis in Walis. This Constantyne fyndyng na securite of his
life in Walis, fled in Ireland, quhare he leuit certane eris with his wife and
children unknown amang the indegent and pure pepyll on almous. Als sone as he
was knawin, be persuasion of monkis he schoif his held in ane abbay of the
samyn cuntre, quhare he leui^ ane deuote life, and was slane after be Scottis,
and eikit to the nowmer of martires. In memory heirof money kirkis at ama^g ws
dedicat to him. This Iurmirik (howbeit he was nocht institute in ye sicker
faith) sufferit ye euangel of Crist to be prechit to Inglysmen, and maid ane
band of peace betuix him and ye Scottis and Pichtis, quhilk endurit to the end
of his life. Eugenius hauand good peace, the residew of his dayis deceissit
the.xxxiiii. eir of his regne. And was buriit in Colmekyl, fra the
Incarnation.v.C.lxviii. eris. In ye.vi. eir of Tiberius the secund of that name
emprioure.

Of king Convvallus and his lavvis and deith. Of ye cumyng of sanct Colme in
scotlund. And of sanct Mungo. Ca. xiiii*
EUgenius buriit in Colmekyll, his brothir was maid king ane prince rycht
catholyke. For he commandit all the principal castellis and townis of his
realm to be payntit with the sign of the croce, that the pepyll thairthrow
mycht have remembrance quhat cruel pane and doloure our saluioure sufferit
thairon. He had ane silver crucifix borne ay before him quhare he past* and kyst
it before he montit on his horse. It was wryttyn with goldyn letteris about the
crucifix, The glore of crystyn pepyll. He inhibite to paynt or graif the sign
of the croce on any pament of kirkis that the pepyll should nocht trampe on ye
samyn. He was neuir seen in the kirk bot with heid discouerit. He maid money
lawis for the liberte of haly kirk. He y^ dang ane priest should want his hand.
He that slew ane priest should be brint, and his guddis confiscat. The teindis of
every frutis that grew on ye ground should be geuyn to ye kirk. He that war
cursit be auctorite of ye kirk, should be banist fra good cumpany, and nane to do
him reverence, na lawis to be patent to him, na faith to be geuyn to his
dispositioun. He dotate the kirkis with rich Iowellis and possessionis to
sustene deuyne service. He gaif all vicaris and personis certane croftis and
landis lyand about the kirkis to cause thaym to be the mair fervent in their
residence and deuotioun. Thus was ye crystyn faith honorit in all partis of his
realm. The fame of this catholic prince causit sa^ct Colme ane man of
syngulare life to cum out of Ireland in Albioun with money relygyous pepyll. At
quhais cumyng was great confluence of Scottis and Pichtis. For ye great felicite
and swei^nes they fand in his preching, he gaderit syndry monkis, quhilkis wa^
that time vagabound throw the realm, and put yame in syndry abbayis, quhilkis
war foundit before be Conuallus. And not lang after he come in Lowthiane. Quhare
he purgit Brudeus king of Pi^htis, and his pepyl fra Pelagius herisyis. At this
time was sanct Mungo the haly byschop of Glasquew, quhilk was gottin on sanct
Thanew the douchter of Loath king of Pichtis, oppressed contrar her will be
Eugenius last king of scottis. This Mungo heirand sanct Colme preiche before
Brudeus, was rauist in spreit be his deuyne wourdis, and followit him to
Dunkeld, quhare Conwallus beildit ane rich abbay before. Bot now be
magnifice^ce of princis it is maid ane bischoppes seit craftily biggit with
square and polyst stanis, quhe^ their two haly men had remanit.vi. monethis in
Dunkeld, they departit hame. Sanct Mungo returnit to Glasquew and sanct Colme
to Ireland, and schew to ye princis thairof, how plesandly he was tretit amang
the Scottis and pichtis, quhat fervent desire they had to his preching, bot ane
thing was their above all meruellis seen be him before. Conwallus king of
scottis nochtwithstanding his princely estait and riches (quhilkis should induce
him mair to pleseir than virtew) was na les religious than any other prelat or
kirkman in his realm. And for his prouyn virtew was haldyn in sic reverence
amang his pepyll, yt na person durst be iniurius to other, nor it speik of him
any detraction. Throw quhilk al vicis of his pepyl (yocht they war naturally
inclinit thairto) war dan^it mair be his virtew than any rygour. In the eir
followyng sanct Colme returnit in Albion, and brocht with him the son of
Conra^nus namit Aidane, quhilk fled before (as we schew) i^ Ireland, to eschew
ye wraith of Eugenius. At his cumyng in the Ilis he was aduertist how Conwallus
was deceissit the.x. eir of his regne, and his body cumand with great lament of
pepyll to be buri^t in Colmekyl. And thairfore he went to his abbay, and did
his funeral obsequeis in deuote manner.

Of king Kynnatyll, and how he resignit the crovn to Aidane. Of the orison
maid be sanct Colme. How scottis and pichtis faucht amang thaym self. and war
agreit be sanct Colme. Ca. ^v.
COnwallus deceissit in this manner, ane counsall was set in Argyle fra our
redemption.v.C.lxxviii eris. In quhilk Kinnatyll brothir to Conwallus before
rehersit was maid king. Kynnatyll (as na man beleuit) ressauit Colme and Aidane
with great humanite, and prayit Aidane to be of good curage. For within schort
time he should reiose the crown of Scotland, and have sic succession that he should
deliver ye realm of money displesouris. And it it was vncertane for the time be
quhat deuyne revelation or prophecy, he mycht schaw sic thi^gis. Within few
dayis eftir ane imoderat flux of catterre fell in his throat and chaftis, and
causit him to resign the governance of his realm to Aidane. Sa^ct Colme seand
him approach to the extremis of deith, Exhortit him to have all thing in
contemption, saiffing the felicite of heuyn, quhare he was haistely to pas.
Kinnatyl deuotely obtemperand to Sanct Colme randerit his saul to god the
feird month of his regne, his body was buryit in Colmekyll. Ane co^uention was
maid sone after in Argyle, in quhilk Aidane was maid king. Sanct Colme (because
he was present at his conuention) put the diadem on king Aidanis heid, and
said to the nobyllis in this wise. It is nocht neidfull (may nobyll men) to
exh^^^ ow to any great devotion, sen ye sa^nyn incressis daily as apperis amang
ow. it I thynk nocht vnganand to exhort ow to be obeysant to our prince Aidane
under ane mind and assent, For he is not only brocht to this solemn auditour
be my industry, bot erar be prouysyoun of god. His office sall be to govern ow
in equale Justice and peace, an^ deliver ow of trubyll quhen it occurris. our
part salbe thairfore t^ leif togydder under him with an^ good mind and
beniuolence, standing sa content with our awin guddis, that e couat nane

gudnes of god, quhilk hes instruckit ow in his blissit lawis and maid ow his
deir pepil. And fortunat ow to haif ane prince of singular virtew. Be quhais
prudence our faith salbe sic kir, and our common weill put to profet with sic
felicite (gyf e be obeysa^t to him) that na ennymes sall appeir aganis ow. Be
the contrar (quhilk god forbeid) gyf e declyne the constitutionis of god, and
be rebelland to ye ministeris of Justice. Or gif our prince Aidane be
unmindful of the giftis of god, abusand him in ye administration of his
realm. Tha^ sal nocht faill to cu^ on ow sindry plages and civil
contentionis, quhilkis sal gyf occasioun to our ennymes to inuaid ow to our
vter exterminio^, les than e amend our demeritis in time. Provide thairfore e
be nocht sa insolent eftir hie chance of prosperity, that e incur ye hatrent of
god, exponand both our singular and common weill to extreme dangeir. Ye pepil
being exhortit be yir wourdis promittit their faithful obedience to king
Aidane. Sic thingis done sanct Colme returnit in ye Ilis. And Aidane went in
Galloway, quhare he be Justice dantit part of theuis, quhilkis infestit the
cuntre. And to repres vthir enormiteis done in his realm. He set ane
conuention of his nobillis in sindry partis thairof. In quhilk be prudence of
sanct Colme were deuisit sindry thyngis for the common weill. Throw quhilk great
tranquillite succedit money dayis ef^ir. Nochtheles (as the chance of man often
occurris) few pepil hes that prudence to make yame stand in lang felicite.
Certane nobillis (quhilkes mycht nocht lang suffir peace) fell i^ ane hie
contentioun at the huntis be interuentioun of ane cause of nocht. Throw quhilk
followit haistly great slauchter. The slayaris knawyng yame feirslie socht be
rigor of Justice, and hauand na refuge to eschew the kyngis lawis, fled to
Brudeus king of Pychtis. Als sone as king Aidan was aduertist yairof, he send
his ambassatouris to ye king of Pichtis, requiryng him be tennour of his
confideratioun, to deliver their men to his Justice. Brudeus mouit be
co^miseratioun and picte of their banist men refusit his desyris, and be
frequent message excusit their iniquite. Thus maid he the iniuris of otheris to
be occasioun of battall aganis him self. King Aidane (because their rebellis were
nocht deliuerit at his pleseir) send ane cumpany of armyt men in Angus to
inuaid ye cuntre with all displesouris yat thai micht. The scotts (quhilkis
were send to this behalf) brocht ane huge pray of guddis out of Angus. And slew
all thaym that maid obstakill. The Pychtis impatient to suffir this iniure
recompensit ye samyn with siclyk heirschippis and slauchter on ye Scottis. The
fury and rage of insolence ylk day more incressyng maid this debait to be
finalie decidit be ye swerd. Sone eftir they gaderit on both ye sydis in
Striuelyng, quhair they faucht togiddir with gre^ murdir. And youcht ye
victory succedit to ye Scottis, it it was vnplesand. For Arthurus eldest son
to king Aidan and prince of Scotland was slane in this field, Thus tuke ye
scottis more heaviness and dolor be his slauchter, than pleseir be their
victory. Sanct Colme he^rand this unhappy battall come to king Aidane and
repreuit him that he for small occasioun mouit battal on his confiderat
freindis. Throw quhilk he was cause nocht only of may lamentabill slauchter,
bot als bringyng money pepill to schamefull and vter pouerte. And thairfore
declarit (gyf ye sam^^ were nocht hastily reparit) he and all his blude be
Justice of god should be cruelly punist. Aidane affray it be yir wourdes, Prayit
sa^ct Colme to schaw be quhat way he mycht amend the offense be him co^mittit.
This haly man seeing Aidane penitent be co^miseration. Went to Brudeus king of
Pychtis. And schew how vnprudentlie yis unhappy bergane was begun, and quhat
mischief was to follow on both ye pepil, (...) they perseuerit in battal
aganis other. Be their wourdis Brudeus co^di^cendit to have peace. Thus were
ba^^h y^ kingis content ye sa^ct Colme be Judge in this debait to euin all
ma^^cis as he thocht best. Finalie both their kyngis were aggreit, and brocht be
his prudence to the samyn tenderness as they were before. Within schort time this
haly man sanct Colme returnit in the Ilis, and fell in ane great infirmite be
immoderat flu^ of caterre, quhilk followit him to the end of his life.

he was rycht desirus to eik his empire, he solistit Brudeus king of Pichtis to
inuaid the Scottis. And promittit gyf he wald inuaid thaim be battall (sen ye
iniuris done be his pepill was nocht redressit) to support him with all the
power that he mycht. This battall was nocht persuadit be Ethelfreid for any
affection he had to Pichtis, bot only to have thaym brokin with Scottis. that
he mycht than ye more esalie conques their realm. Brudeus refusit at ye first
time to raise any army aganis his confiderat nichtbouris. Nochtheles be
inoportune sollicitatioun of his nobillis, he condiscendit thairto. The motive
of yis battall was, because the guddis reft before fra his pepyll be Scottis war
nocht restorit as the contract proportit. King Aydane to meit both the treason
of Pichtis and Saxonis was confiderat with Malgo king of britonis in this
manner. Gif the saxonis and Pychtis invade the Brytonis, king Aydane sall cum in
their support. And gif the Pichtis and Saxonis come on the scottis, the king of
Britonis sal support yame in yat samyn manner* The Saxonis weil aduertist of
this co^fideration, to draw ye scottis fra their rowmes, and to make thaym laik
vittallis, Enterit with ye Pichtis in ye Britonis landis. king Aydane sone
after assemblit all the pissance of his realm, and come with the samyn in
support of Britonis. The Saxonis and Pychtis nochtwithstandyng his cummyng maid
yame to eschew battall be lang tarry, abiding the cumyng of syndry other saxonis
to their support. Than suddanly apperit in sycht Cenlyne king of west saxonis
with new garrison to support their army. The Scottis and Britonis (howbeit they
war affrayit of their cumyng) thocht best (sen na help apperit, bot in their
handis) to meit this new army of west saxonis, and fynaly put thaym to flycht
and slew Cutha son to Cenlyne. After this victory the Scottis and Britonis
reiosit with sic excellent mirth, as was vsit in they dayis. In the mean time
the north saxonis with ye residew of yair folkis (quhilkis were laitly
discomfist) come on the Scottis and Britonis with new battall. Thus war the
Scottis and Britonis sa affrayit, y^ na noyis nor word was in all their army.
King Aidane knawyng this scilence na sign of audacite, bot erar of de^eckit
mind said in this manner. Quhare is now (good companionis) our knichtly curage^
quhare is now our inuincibyl sprei^? Is our glaidnes euanist before e be

our wraith and cruelie on him, sen he is first rute of all this trubyll, and e
sall have quhat plesand reward that I may geif ow gyf e have victory, quhilk
now is i^ to our handis. Their wourdis war skarsly rehersit, quhen the Saxonis
fechtand in the rycht wyng war put abak. And incontinent Ethelfred come with
ane chosyn cumpany i^ yair support. Exhorting thaym to tak na affray of their
febyll aduersa^is, quhome they sa often vincust before. Brudeus fechtand in ye
richt wyng with the Pichtis, and his may vaileant capitanis in the left wyng,
p^^ the Scottis in great afflyctioun, Nochtheles the Scottis perseuerit in
ythand battall quhill they saw ye myddyll ward (quhare the Britonis faucht)
discomfist. And than they gaif backis, on quhome foll^wit the Pychtis and
Saxonis with lang chase. In this battall war slane Brennius Thane of ye I Will of
Man, Dongarus the third son of Aydane with money nobyllis and commonis on all
sydis. king Ethelfred loist ane of his eyne. Brudeus was evil woundit and money
of his nobyllis slane in his defense.

How Saxonis and Pychti^ war dyscomfist in Northumberland be Scottis and
Brytonis. Of the deith of sanct Come and sanct A^dane* Of the vengeance that
come on the Saxonis for dingyng of sanct Austyne. and of syndry haly men. Ca.

EThelfred na thing satifyit of yis victory of scottis and Britonis at
Deglaston come the nixt symer with ye pichtis i^ Galloway with purpos other to
bring ye same to vte^ heirschip, or ellis bring the samy^ under their dominion.
Aidane weill aduertist of their mind send to the britonis to cum to his
support, syne went with all power that he mycht get in Galloway. And fand at
his cumyng the Pychtis and saxonis besy a^ their incursionis but array. And
incontinent he set on thaym with array^^ battall, and money of thaym slew and
the remanent put to flicht. And in the nycht following he come to ye army of
Britonis, and mengit both the armyis togidder. Als sone as ye ^ychtis and
saxonis were aduertist ^hairof, they set thaym with strange bus^hementis to keip
all the entres and straitis of Annandale. Thus was na way nor passage to ye
army of Scottis and Britonis, bot only to pas throw the dangerus river and
sink and sandis of Sulloway. The Britonis and Scottis seand thaym inclusit yus
on al sidis, parkit yame haistelie amang the strenthis of the cuntre, as they
were in the samyn to remane. Syne rasit yair army with in the nycht quhen yair
fayis suspec kit na thing les tha^ yair removing* and com ouir Sulloway ye
may propera^t way they mycht in Northumbirla^d. And left behynd yame ane huge
fire birnand al nycht, that yair ennymes should have na presumptioun of their
departing. And at their cumyng in Northumberland, they inuadit the pepill
thairof with may cruelte of fire and swerd. The saxonis and Pichtis knawyng
their pepill in Northumberland oppressed be this violence, left galloway. And
with huge pyne co^ in their ennymes sycht. On the morrow both ye armyis ragea^d
in m^ist hatrent aganis other Iunyt togi^^^. The saxonis with sic incredible
furye ruschit in battall aganis the scottis but any sycht to deith, that money
of thaim were doung be dynt of swerdis to the ground. it because fr^^ch men come
in all placis (quhair they were slopit) the victory was l^ng vncertane, and the
chance of fortoun newtrale. Quhil at last Aidane with other his vaileant
capitanis began to raise his folkis in hope of victory and spretit yame with
sic curage, yat they be perseuerand fechting put ye saxonis and pichtis to
flicht* and maid mair slauchter on thaym be cha^e* than was in the first
battall. In the nycht before this battall sanct Colme was in the abbay of
Colmekill, and schew to ye brethir thairof ye king Aidane was to fecht on ye
morrow, and co^mendit him and his army to their prayaris, and na dout is bot ye
prayer of yis haly man was richt supportable to king Aidane. For in the samyn
hour (that victore fell to Scottis) he reuelit it to his brethir in the said
abbay, and gart thaym gyf the loving thairof to god. Eftir yis victory the
king be sound of trumpat gaderit his folkis to the standart. And eftir great
apprisyng of their manheid, He gave ye tent part of ye spule gottin in this
field to repare the kirkis of Scotland* and send ye banaris of saxonis and
Pychtis to san^t Colme to remane in his abbay of Colmekill. In memory of this
excellent victory. In this battall was slane Cenlyne king of west saxonis with
Culyne and Qu^itelyne his principal capitanis. Schort time followyng sanet

Latania mayor on sanct Markis day to implore the mercy of god aganis ane
terrible pest, quhilk raise in Rome be inundatioun of Tibir. This Gregour send
in England two haly men namyt Austyne and Millite to bring the saxonis to
cristin faith. For ye saxonis bure sic hatrent aganis the Britonis and
Inglismen, that they wald heir na doctrine nor precheing of yame. And yairfore
it was necessar that their two haly men should cum in Ingland to instruk the
saxonis in ye Cristin faith. Finalie quhen this haly man sa^ct Austyne was
precheand to ye saxonis in Myglinton, they were nocht only rebella^d to his
precheing, bot in his contemptioun they sewit fische talis on his abi^ement.
Otheris alliegis they dang him with skait rumpillis. Nochtheles this derisioun
succedit to their great displesoure. For god tuke on thaym sic vengeance, that

and deceissit in ye Basse ane strange castall within the sea. The parochinaris
of Auldham, Tynnyngham and Prestoun contendit, quhilk of thaym three should have

Of king Kenneth. Of Eugenius the fourt. How the king of Britonis was doung

ANe co^uention was maid in Argyle eftir deith of king Aidane In the quhilk
Kennethkeir son to Co^wallus before rehersyt was maid king. And deceissit ye
fourt month eftir his coronation. Eftir his deith Eugenius the fourt of that

his deith to king Aidane, that how^^it he had money other sonnis elder than
Eugenius, it nane of thaym should reiose the crown of Scotland bot only
Eugenius. Quhilk was prouin weill eftir. For ye residew of his sonnis were slane
be sindry chancis of battal. Eugenius was sa institute in his outh be doctrine
of sanct Colme, that he was geuin erar to defend his awin tha^ to inuaid

oppressouris of his pure subdittis. Be contrar he tretit yame with great
reverence and honouris, quhen he fand thaym virtewis. In the ten^t eir of his
regne, Cingell king of west saxonis, and Ethelfred king of Northu^birland come
with ane great army aganis Cadwallo king of hi^ tonis. And chasit him in
Scotland. Nochtheles he abaid schort time (...) it bot past to Bartane, quhare
he gat sic support be the king thairof, that he returnyt in Walis. and nocht
only recouerit his realm, bot slew great noumer of saxonis. At yis time
Reidwald king of eist saxonis and Ethelbreid king of south Saxonis com with
great armyis aganis Ethelfreid king of Northumbirland. For he put thaim before to
great affliction for taikyng of the cristin faith. Their armyis faucht togidd at
Wintringham, quhair Ethelfreid was slane with the may part of all his pepill.
His last wourdis were yir, I de as I leuit protector of religioun of goddis,
and ennyme to cristin pepil. And with their wourdis he randerit his unhappy

Ethelfreid had.vii. sonnis namyt Eufreid, Oswald, Oslaws, Oswan, Offas, Osmond,
and Osyk. Their.vii. brethir detestand the treasoun of Pychtis (because they
come nocht in support of their fadir) fled to Eugenius, quhair they were
plesandlie ressauit. And tuke the cristyn faith. Their sister Ebba eschewyng
the pollutioun of her body, gat ane bait be deuyne mirakill, and come but help

Quhilkes were before distroyit be cruelte of Saxonis. And stuffi^ the strenthis
of his bordouris with strange munitionis, me^ and vitallis. and deceissit
the.xv. eir of his regne fra the incarnatioun.vi.C.xx. eris. and was buryit in
Colmekyll. At this time Bonifacius bischop come with ane cumpany of haly men
out of Italy in the mouth of Tay. Sum authouris sayis he was chosyn pape after
sanct Gregoure, and wylfully renunsit the paperie, and come to the Scottis. And
yocht he be nocht nowmerit amang the legend of papis. it we find him ane man of
syngulare life and doctrine. The place (quhare he landit first in Scotland) was
ereckit be him in ane kirk in honor of sanct Petir ye appostyll. After this he
went to ane town namit Tullyne three mile fra Dunde, Quhare he rasit ane other
kirk siclike in name of sanct Petir. He foundit the kirk of Restynneth, quhilk
is now ane abbay of channownis regular. After this he went throw syndry partis
of Scotland, quhare he precheit the euangellis. At last he come in Ros quhare
he perseuerit to the end of his life, and was buryit in Rosmatkyn. And in this
time was the haly man and bischop Sanct Melok ane great precheour, and was

Of the vicius tyrane king Ferquhart. and how he slew him self. and of the
haly man Fiacre* Ca. xix.
EUgenius deceissit (as we have schawin) had three sonnis. Ferquhart* Fyacre,
and Doneuald* Ye eldest Ferquhart was maid king. Their three sonnis of Eugenius
was geuyn in yair outh to ye haly man sanct Conane bischop of the I Will of Man.
Ferquhart and Doneuald proffitit na thing in ye said I Will, traisting letteris
vnproffytabyll to their estait, The third bruthir Fyacre was geuyn to
contemplation, and tuk purpos to eschew ye cumpany of men with all warldly
digniteis. And to make him vnknawyn to the pepyll, he tuke ane pure habit and
departit out of Scotland in France, quhare he leiffit ane solitar life, and gat
ane croft geuyn to him be sanct Pharo bischop of Melden, and ane chapel
ereckit to him* quhare he leiffit the residew of his dayis. It is said all
women that gangis in his chapel will be other blind or wod. In the empire of
Ferquhart throw lang peace raise great division amang the nobyllis to the great
damage of the realm. This king was sa neclygent and sowpit in all manner of
vice, yat he gaif na labor to meis the seditioun amang his nobyllis, traisting
sa lang as trubyll and slauchter endurit ama^g his nobyllis, na rebellyon should
rise aganis him. Throw quhilk the realm was put to great mischief. And because
all yis trubyl come throw necligence of yis unhappy tyrane, he was hatit and
reput may abhominabyll to his pepyll, throw quhilk he come to sic infelicite,
that he had nothir reverence to god nor sicht to the co^moun weil. And as the
use of tyrannis is, he dred all men, and no man had him in reverence. The
nobillis hauand great displesour that the realm was mysgouernit be him in this
manner, conuenit amang thaym self, and reparit all iniuris but his advise. It
was beleuit be the nobillis (because they saw sa money enormiteis i^ him) yt he
should fall in Pelagius herespis. Howbeit all other Scottis kyngis before him war
neuir atte^tit with sic things. Their suspicion was ye mair vehement, that he
was accumpani^t with britonis of ye samyn errouris. At last he was aspyit makand
derision that oung children war brocht to ye font to have baptism, and yat ye
pepil maid their confession to preistis. Ye nobillis mouit with his detestabyll
werkis, send ane herald to bring him to their counsal to know gif sic thingis
(as war deuulgat of him) had ^aith. And because they fand him rebelland to their
chargis, they tuke him be force out of ye castle (quhare he was) and put him
in prison. And incontinent they tuke consultatioun quhidder he should be degradit
or haldyn in perpetual prison. After lang aduysement it was concludit to
continue him still in prison, and to send ambassatouris in France to bring
Fyacre the secound son of Eugenius in scotland to ressaue ye crown thairof. And
gif they micht persuaid him be na reason to the said effect, to desire
Clotarius king of France to interpone his auctorite to cause Fyacre to be send
in Scotland to ressaue ye governance thairof. The ambassatouris (quhilkis war
send to this effect) come finaly quhare this Fyacre was at his contemplatioun.
Bot it before yair cumyng he was aduertist be ane visioun of their desyris, and
besoucht god to suffer him nocht be frustrat of the heuynly plesour that he had
in his solitar contemplation, god hard his prayer. And quhen yis ambassatoures
was brocht to his presence, he apperit to yair sycht sa full of lipper, that he
was repute be thaym may horribyll creature in erd. The ambassatoures seeing
him at sic point, demandit him cauldly, gif he couate to return i^ Scotland,
quhare he mycht be purgit of his malady be natyue fude, and schew thaym send be
ye nobyllis of scotland to provide him in all necessaris to the samyn fine.
Fyacre (quhilk had na mair respect to honouris than to may abhominabyll
pestilence) answerit. I believe e know how I have taken me fra cu^pany of the
world to ane solitar life, howbeit the sorrowful malady (that I suffer) be erar
emendatioun of my life induceing me to humillyte, than any vice of nature. My
sufficience is with this pure sell and sobir herbis quhilkis I prepare with my
ha^dis, and standis sa content thairwith, that I desire na warldly dignite.
Thairfore return hame, and bid my brothir and his noblis have sycht to god
religioun and Justice, and arm yame with virtew, quhilk may be vincust be na
irruption nor violence of ennymes. And understand that I am brocht to sic
estate be will of god, that ane private life is may ganand for me. Fyacre had
ane sister namyt Syra. quhilk heirand of her brutheris halynes. come to him at
Melden. be quhom^ scho was professit Nun with money other virginis of the samyn
mind. and perseuerit in good relygyoun and deuotioun to the end of their life.
The nobyllis of Scotland knawyng be their ambassatouris the estate of Fyacre,
chesit four men to be gouernouris of ye realm quhill they war mair profundly
resoluid concerning the governance yaitof. The samyn time Ferquhart vexit with
malancoly and seiknes be his prisonyn^ (that he should nocht remane in pyne) slew
him self y^.xii. ei^ of his regne. Fra ye incarnation vi.C.xxxii. eris.

Of king Doneuald* and of the deith of Edvvyne king of Northumberland. How
Eufred and Osrik kyngis of Northumberland war punist for their ^^^a^ny done to
cristin pepyl* and how king Osvvald conuertit the Saxonis to the faith of
Crist. Ca. xx.
FErquhart ye tyrane slane (as said is) ane counsall was set in Argyle. In ye
quhilk Doneuald the third son of Eugenius was maid king. This Doneuald
following the governance of his fader reparit all placis, quhilkis were dekeyit
before be neclygence of Ferquhart. At this time Cadwallo king of Brytonis, and
Penda king of south Saxonis war considerat togydder, and slew Edwyne king of
Northumberland, and come with great cruelte throw Mers and Berwyk and tuke
syndry landis fra dominioun of Pychtis. The Pychtis hauand na power to resist
their c^ueltees send to king Doneuald for support. And because they ga^ na
support they war oppressed with importabyll iniuris* King Doneuald he^^a^d the
deith of Edwyne send to his considerat brothir Cadwallo king of Brytonis,
praying him to admyt Eufred the son of king Ethelfred to the crown of
Northumberland, and quhen the samyn was grantit, Eufred left his remanent
brethir in scotland, and was admittit to the half of the crown of
Northumberland, and that other half was geuyn to ane falls and unhappy man namyt
Osrik. Their two kyngis of Northumberland war fynaly confyderat togidder be
affinite. For Osrikis douchter was geuyn ^o Eufred in marriage, and (...) ye
catholic faith, and become may odious tyrannis and persewaris of goddis
seruantis fylland the cuntre full of falls errouris of gentilis. Throw quhylk
syndry Pichtis fell in the said errouris. Quhill at last be correctioun of the
bischoppis they war recounsallit to the faith. Cadwallo king of Britonis rycht
displesit that Eufred and Osrik (quhylkis war promouit be him to the empire of
Northumberland) war fallyn in sic errouris, that they desyrit erar to be
heritikis, than cristin pepyll, send preistis to purge thaym of their errouris.
Bot their preistis returnit evil doung and na thing sped of yair purpos. The
c^istin princis of Albioun heirand this contemption send other messingeris to
their two kyngis with scharp writing than before, bot their preistis for the mair
contemptioun war slane. The rage and cruelte of their dispitfull tyrannis grew
sa great, that all cristin pepyll dwelling beside yame war martyrit, except sa
money as were sauit be flycht. The pryncis of Albioun mouyt be their cruelteis
tuke purpos to punys thaym with may rygoure. And to bring the samyn to good
fine, they maid Cadwallo and Penda general capitanis of thai^ we^is, and
gaderit ane great multitude of Brytonis, Pychtis, and Saxonis hauand na thing at
mair hatrent than errouris of gentilis. Osrik and Eufred knawing the ^u^myng of
sa money pryncis aganis yame rasit all pepyll under their dominion, and faucht
aganis the said princis of Britane. Nochtheles yair army was discomfist and
their self taken prisoneres, and within few dayis after they slew thaym self be
disperatioun. In this battall nane was found sa cruel aganis Osrik and Eufred
as Oswald their bruthir, and for that cause he was maid king of Northumberland.
King Oswald after his coronatioun send to king Dowald desyryng certane
precheouris to be send out of Scotland to convert his pepyl to the faith. King
Dowald send at his request ane man of na les grauite than erudition namit
Cormane. And quhen this Cormane had prechit lang time amang the Northumbrianis,
he was sa cu^ius in his Theology, that his sermon apperit mair for vane
ostentatioun and pride, than any doctrine to the pepyll. And fynaly he returnit
in Scotland, and schew to the prelatis thairof, yat the Northumbrianis war sa
dull, that na doctrine mycht proffit thaym, and war nocht only repugnant to
his command, bot contempnit ye samyn, as contrar to yair lawis and
constitutionis. The prelatis heirand their wordis tuke syndry consultationis,
quhat was best to bring their pepyl out of their arrouris. Sum men thocht
expedient to send Cormane agane in Northumbirland with money otheris doctouris,
and to spare na lauboure for the weill of crystyn faith and plesour of their
friend king Oswald. Traisting be continewall labor, yt ye Northumbrianis micht
be bro^^^ to the faith, Yocht sic thingis micht nocht be haistely done. Otheris
said gif the Northumbrianis mycht any way have been recou^seld to ye faith,
they wald have dene brocht be Cormane erar than any other, because he was richt
resolute in deame letteris and was ane profound clerk. And sen his doctrine na
thing aualit, it was not necessar to send any other doctouris to ye samyn
effect. Than Aidane the haly bischop said in this manner. To bring men fra
errouris, and to reduce yame to sicker faith, I thynk it expedient (wise
faderis) to schaw sic thingis in ye beginning, as may persuaid yame in fervent
luf of god. And quhen the precheour hes maid ye pepyl desyrus to heir his
sermon, and taken yair beniuolence, to preche first the foundment of ye cristin
faith but any ostentation or arrogance, nocht inuoluyng the pepyl with sic
difficil materi^ as may not be apprehendit with yame. For as ye ingyne of men
at nocht drawin haistely fra evil accustom, siclik they learn all science and
virtew be process of time, and lernis the may facil materis first. Be this way
I traist their science is ye mair imprentit in their breist. Heirfore gif the
reverend byschop Cormane had obseruit this rite in ye beginning, and obstenit
fra curious questyonis of our faith. I dout nocht bot the pepil should have been
obeydient to his comma^deme^tis. Thairfore sen na thing is sat^fyit to the
desire of king Oswald. I thynk the samyn is cumyn na les in defalt of the
doctoure, than the pepyll. For their causis best is it to send ane new
pr^cheoure in Northumberland, that sal first in his precheing geif thaym mylk,
and after geif yame mair ferme ^ude. Other wayis they will neuir be brocht to ye
faith. The bischoppes apprisit his cou^sal, and with ane mind send him self to do
yis charge in Northumberland, and he refusit not ye charge, bot come with glaid
their to king Oswald. At quhais cumyng sic confluence of pepil conuenit, that
he was constranit to preche outwith ye kirkis throw multitude of pepyll that
come to his prechyng. alwayis because this Aidane had nocht ye langage of
Saxonis, he had great impediment in his preching. Nochtheles king Oswald had the
langage both of scottis and saxonis, and interpret all his prechyng to ye
pepyl. Throw quhilk they war haldyn both in great veneration, and
co^uertit.vii.M. Saxonis within few dayis to cristin faith. The Saxonis tha^
were callit Inglismen. The Northu^brianis chesit Aydane to be yair bischop. and
because they saw ylk day their devotion incres, and great now mer of preistis

Of the unhappy prophet Machomete and his false lavvis. Of sindry haly men. Of
king Ferquhart and his extorsionis done aganis the pepyll, and of his
miserabyll end. Ca. xxi.
ABout this time deceissit ye warijt creature Machomete, quhilk was in the time
of king Ferquhart. he was got tyn be ane ydolatour, vncertane of Arraby or
Persy. And his mother was ane catholyk woman of the Hismaelitis. This Machomete
was Instytute in his outh both in the hethyn and crystyn lawis. And because he
thocht nane of thaym according to his plesoure, he maid ane falls and
supersticius rite richt warijt to mankind. Quhen he was cumyn to ma^nis age, he
conquest his leuyng on thift and pikary. And mariit ane wedow namit Cadigane.
Be quhome he conquest great riches, landis and possessionis. and come be syndry
cha^cis to sa great estimatioun amang ye pepyll of Araby, that he maid lawis to
govern thaym in Justice. He was instruckit be ane cursit Monk namit Sergius, be
quhom he colleckit his lawis fra institutionis of syndry pepyll. He ratifyis
the sacrament of baptism. And haldis Crist borne of ane clean virgyne. He
commendis the psalmis and euangellis, and say is they war mendit be his
Alcorane.

This Alcorane was the manner of ane Bybyll gaderit be him with money falls
Institutis and lawis. He ratifyis the Circumcision as Iowis dois. He denyis the
Trinite as the Sabellianis dois. He denyis that ye fader is coequale to the
son as the ennomianis dois. He sayis the haly spreit is ane creature as the
Macedonis dois. Schortly his lawis at all maid for the sensualite of man. Throw
quhilk he drew syndry pepil to his opinion, This corruppit faith of Machomete
is spread in Asia, Affrik, and mekyll of Europe. It began fra ye
incarnation.vi.C.xxxv. eris. At this time war in France money haly men as
Fursius, Stoilanus, and Uulcanus brethir, gottin of ye blude rial of Scotland
and Ireland. Amang ws war in that time Connane Columbane, Cromane and Domiane,
with money otheres. This history tuiching sanct Colme, king Aidane, and s^nct
Aidane with money other haly (...) before rehersit, is colleckit be sa^ct (...)
bot we will return to our history* After the deith of king Dowald, (...) brothir
son Ferquhard son to king Ferquhard before rehersit was maid king. He was
ane man of hie ingyne. Bot after his coronation he was alterit fra ane liberal
and humane prince in may insaciabyl and bludy tyrane. Quhe^ he was but
auctoure* he was liberal above his power, and gaif his guddis to support
madynnis to yair marriage, and had s^c co^miseration on every person yt was
deieckit fra good fortoun i^ powerce, that he conquest great favor of the
pepyll, and was iugit thairfore to be ane nobyll prince. Als sone as he he was
clothit with publik auctorite he become ane oppressor of the pepyl, full of
avarice like ane bludy fleschour ennyme to religion, comparit justly to ane
insaciabyl pul^, and clamit agane all the guddis) quhilkis he gaif before his
auctorite) to hes nobillis, and said they war bot lent. And fynaly he slew all
thaym ye war repugnant to his wayis, or ellis confiscat their guddis, and held
thaym in prysone. He oppressed all the rich men of his realm and confiscat
their guddis be vane causis. At this time war two haly men namit Finnane and
Colmane haldin amang Scottis in great veneration. Their haly men herand the
cruelte done be this bludy tyrane, come for ele of Justice persuading him to
amend his life. At last finding him penitent na wayis, they denuncit him
cursit. This unhappy man tuke litill indignatioun thairof, and be assistance of
vicious lymmaris (quhilkis war reddy to intertene him in his insolence) he tuke
plesoure thris ylk day to fars his wambe with all surfettis and delycius cheir
yt micht be deuisit to make him inebriat and dru^kin with other vices not
worthy to be rehersit. His mouth was sa insaciabill, yt na foul in ye air,
nor fische in the seyis had rest for his schamefull glotony. And it na thing
maid him sa odius to ye pepill, as his rebellioun aganis the censuris of haly
kirk. Ama^g money other his enormiteis. he fukeit his two douchteris, and slew
his wife, because scho detestit his vices. The pepill seeing him persevere in sic
horribill tyranny gaderit with deliuerit mind to put him to deith. Nochtheles
they war inhibit be sanct Colmane, quhilk schew be divine prophecy (gif he
amendit not haistely his life) he should be punist be ye justice of god, and that
was weill prouin within ane month after. For this king was hu^tand ane wolf in
the fellis, and quhe^ scho was sarit with ye hou^ndis, scho ruschit on the king
and bait him in ye side. Fynaly this king fell in ane may vile and schameful
maledy vncertane quhidder it come be bit of ye wolf or be any other occasioun.
Ane vennomus humor eit and consumyt ye inwart membris of hes body with
intollerabill pyne. His lymmis feit and secreit membris with vile ^eroure were
dissoluit. His wambe throw immoderat voracite was swolin (as he had been
edroppit). And quhen he had continewit two eris in this infirmite, as
abhominabill to all creaturis, He become penitent. Saying had I been obedient
to the counsall of Colmane I had nocht been deuorit with this horrible malady
and etin with vile worms be Just punition of god. This uncouth and Importabill
doloure schawis now money great offencis both aganis god and man. Now I am
destitute of all remeid without his mercy be ye more. Their worms yt ar bred in
my flesch schawis me may horrible and unhappy creature. In the mean time ran
to him his seruandis, and inquirit gyf he desyrit ane priest to heir his
confessioun. Than said he, Bring to me bischop Colmane. Als sone as this
Colmane was brocht to him, he affoileit him first of the cursyn, and eftir that
he had hard his confession he persuadit him to be of good curage, and to have
hop in god, quhais mercy was mair yan any syn yt he mycht do. For god said
turn ow to me, and e salve saif. King Ferquhart rasit in hope be their wourdis,
fell on kneis askand mercy with pictuus teris, and ressauit the blissit body of
Crist. Sone eftir he was brocht out of the house quhare he lay with vile
claithes to the nixt mote, Quhair he gaif the gaist the.xviii. eir of his
regne. Fra the incarnatioun.vi.C.lxiiii. eris. And in this samyn eir sanct
Aidane bischop of Northumberland deceissit. In quhais place succedit Fynnane
quhilk deceissit sone eftir in ye samyn manner. Eftir his deith succedit bischop
Colmane, be quhais haly precheing great multitude of Saxonis were brocht to
cristin faith. This Colmane past throw al ye kirkis amang the saxonis,
precheing the wourd of god. And was translatit to the Cathedral kirk of
Lyndefern.

Of king Maldvvine. and how he was slane be his wife, and his wife brint.
Of great mortalite be rage of pest in syndry pa^tis of the vvarld* and how ye
scottis was preseruit fra ye samyn. Ca. xxii.
FErquhard deceissit in yis wise, Maldwyne son of Dowald was maid king. He was
ane deuote price and tuk peace with Pichtis and saxonis. He tuke sic deligence
in administratioun of Justice, that his pepil leuit but iniuris. Thus succedit
al thing plesandlie in the beginning of his empire. At last raise ane seditioun
betuix the men of Leuenax and Argyle. and drew money of ye nobillis in
forttifying of their debait. And because the Ilis raise with Argyle, and Galloway
raise with the Leuenax, money heirschippis followit on all sydis. King Maldwyne
to punis their extorsionis come with ane army aganis the principal mouaris
thairof. And ceissit nocht quhill they be extreme rigor of Justice were punyst
to the deith, Thus trubill (that was so fulischelie begun) was dantit so
haistelie. That it maid the name of Maldwine sa feirful to his nobillis that na
seditioun followit their eftir during his empire. Nocht lang eftir the king
went to Colmekil to vesy the sepulturis of his eldaris. And reparit the said
abbay with new biggynnis fra the ground, and dedicat it in honor of god and
sanct Colme. At this time rang ane terrible pest to the great mortalite of the
pepill in sindry partis of the world. And ceissit nocht quhill ye pepil be
continewall prayar fasting and good werkis peacyfyit ye wraith of god. The
scottis in their dayis knew na manner of hait fever. And were preseruit fra the
samyn be te^perance of their mouth. For this cruel pestilence rang neuir amang
the Scottis, quhill they left the hailsum temperance of yair eldaris and maid
thaym self reddy, to re^aue al infirmiteis. Colman bischop of Lyndeferne seand
ane huge multitude of saxonis peris in the pest returnit in the Ilis. Quair he
biggit ane Abbay and dwelt in it with his brethir to the end of his life. Eftir
ye departing of Colmane ye Northumbrianis be support of Pychtis maid
^eitschippis on the Scottis. King Maldwyne ceissit nocht quhill the samyn were
recompensit with siclike displesoure both to Pychtis and saxonis. And for that
cause he incurrit their extreme hatrent. Followit be perseuerand malice great
heitschippis and slauchter on all sydis. quhil at last king Maldwyne was slane
within the nycht be his wife for suspitioun of adultry in the.xx. eir of his

Edfred exhortit his men to reme^bir yair anciant virtew, and to vincus yair

nochyeles king Edfred exhortit his folkis to perseueir in ythand battal. and

Of ye vicius tyrane Amberkeleth and of his deith. Of king Eugenius the vii.
How the scottis and pichtis war recounsalit togidder be affinite* and of the
slauchter of Eugenius wife. Of.vii. haly virginis dotat be ye king of Pichtis
in Ab^rnethy. Ca. xxv.
After ye deith of Eugenius ye.vi. Amberkeleth son or ellis nepote to Eugenius
ye first was maid king. This king alterit his maneres fra he gat auctorite.
Before his electioun he semit to be defe^dour of ye pure pepyl and kirkmen.
Nochtheles fra he was clothit with auctorite, he apperit ane vicius monstour
drownit i^ lust, avarice, and effeminat life. Garnardus king of pichtis seand
this schameful monstoure use na thing semand to ane prince, tuke occasioun to
invade the Scottis, traisting to find sufficient time to revenge the iniuris
done to Pichtis and maid great heirschippis and slauchter on ye Scottis landis.
Amberkeleth (that his febyll curage sall nocht move ennymes to hye attemptatis)
assemblit his army to resist the Pichti^ (...) ^^cht he durst skarsly confide
in his noblis (as the use of tyranny is) quhilkis leuis ay under feir and
dreid. it he went forth wart with displayit baner. He come the first nycht to
the watter of Tay. And after supper past forth in ye glomyng to do his eis with
two seruandis. And in the mean time he was schot throw the heid with ane arrow
be quhom it was vncertane. And deceissit the secound eir of his regne. And
burijt in Colmekyll. The nobillis lytyl co^mouit of his deith (yt their army
should nocht peris for falt of ane heid) maid Eugenius the.vii. of that name,
king. This Eugenius was bruthir to Amberkeleth ane man of great body and good
conditionis. And because he understood hes army brokin be lang weris, he tuk
peace with his nichtbouris the pichtis, and causit redres to be maid on aithir
side. And in the mean time ye two kyngis war confiderat be affinite. For
Spontana douchter of Garnard king of pichtis was geuin in marriage to king
Eugenius. In ye eir following two brethir of Athole (quhilkis were conspirit in
ye kyngis deith for slauchter of their fader) slew this lady great with child i^
sted of Eugenius, for scho was lyand in his bed quhen he happenit to be away.
Eugenius be murmour of the pepyll was lang time suspeckit of her deith and was
constranit thairfore to schaw ye pietuis manner of her slaucht. The murdresares
at last war takin and put cruelli to deith. Eugenius gaif him to religius and
ciuyl materes. and causit al ye mercial dedis of his a^cecessouris to be put in
cronykillis to raise the knichtly curage of his posterite i^ desire of honouris
and laud. He causit their cronikillis to be keipit perpetually in the abbay of
Colmekyll. and expert hystoricianis to be sustenit their on the common purs,
not only to writ the dedis of scottis, bot of all other pepill as ye chance and
time occurrit. This Eugenius reparit syndry kirkis of his realm, and did great
reverence to the byschoppis and prelatis thairof, and e^kit yair patrimony with
syndry possessionis, landis and rentis. He perseuerit in good peace with Pichtis
and Saxonis. and deceissit the.xviii. eir of his regne. fra the
incarnatioun.vii.C.xvi. eris. In his time was Doneuald the haly man (quhilk
leuit ane sobir life at Ogylny sex mylis fra Dunde) haldyn amang Pichtis in
great veneratioun. It is said yt he had.vii. douchteris, quhilk leuit with him in
great pe^nance on beir breid and wattir. They eit neuir bot anis on ye day. and
the residew thairof occup^it i^ continewal labor and orison. His eldest
douchter Maot maid inhibitation to the wyld geis, to eit her faderis corn, and
they obeyit her haly monitionis, and yairfore wyld geis was neuir seen eft on
ye ground. Their haly virginis after deceis of their fader, knawyng na securite
to leif in desertis but sum defendouris of their chastity, come to Garnard king
of Pichtis desyring sum place (quhare they mycht leif ane solitar life) in the
honor of god. Garnard co^discendit to yair desires, and gaif yam ane house in
Abernethy with certane rentis to be takin up of ye nixt la^dis, to their
sustentation, quhare yai leif fit ane deuote life and war burijt at ye rute of
ane ayk, quhilk is haldin it in great veneration amang the pepil. Abernethy i^
ye time was ane ciete of pichtis decorit with ye first seit of bischoppis of
their realm. Bot it was after sa distroyit and brint be weris of scottis, yt
it come neuir agane to the first stait. Their virginis war not in time of
Conra^nus with sanct Brigitta (as ye co^monis haldis) bot in ye time of Eugenius
ye.vii. for he perseuerit in good peace with Garnard and visyit oftymes yir
vginis with his liberalite and guddis and resignit ye crown to Mordak, of quho^
salbe our nyxt history.

Of king Mordak and his vverki^ and of his deith. of.iiii. sindry pepil in
Albion. of the great mirakill^s of sanct Niniane. and of sanct Bid. Ca. xxvi.
THe noblis after ye deith of Eugenius chesit Mordak son of Amberkeleth to be
king. He was ane humyll and liberal prince. He tuk great labouris to cause all the
pepyl yt was in Albion to leif togidder in amite and concord. He maid peace
betuix ye Pichtis Britonis and remanent kyngis of Ingland. In this time (as
sanct Bid remembris) four syndry pepil war in Albion co^fiderat togidder in
peace, richt different in their manerris, langage, and institutionis* that is
to say ye britonis, scottis, pichtis, and saxonis, quhilkis war callit
Inglismen. And because ye wordis of Bid ar corespo^dent to this history I have
inserit yame heir as followis. Ye nation of Pichtis was confiderat with the
Saxonis that time reiosyng to be perticipa^t with ye universal kirk in peace
and catholic verite. The scottis (quhilkes i^habit britane) were sa co^te^t with
yair awin bounds, yt yai wrocht na iniuris nor slichtis co^trar saxonis, and
suppos ye may part of britonis had ane natural hatre^t aganes Inglisme^ for
sindry superstitionis, it be repugnance of ye law of god and man, yai mycht not
optene yair purpos nor desires, for yocht ye britonis be su^pert fre. it yai ar
thirllit su^ part be Inglismen, and thairfore money of yame, both noblis and
commonis be insolence and felicite of lang peace ar mair geuyn to contemplation
of bukis and religion, than to any cheualry or dedis of armis, and quhat end
sall cu^ thairof sall appear sone to our posterite. Yir ar ye last wordis of
ye history writtin be sanct Bid. fra ye incarnation vii.C.xxxi. eris. bot we
will return to our history. King Mordak reparit money abbayis and kirkis i^ his
realm, quhilkis war distroyit before be ye weris of his eldaris. he foundit ye
abbay of quhittern, quhare the blissit byschop sa^ct Ninian kithes daily ma

i^ quhit^ern yai eid sone out of ye use yairof, for ye Ilis obeyit to the
bischop of Galloway and Sodoren quhilk had his principale seit in ye I Will of Man

deceissit sone eft ye co^pleting of ye history of britonis, and was buriit at
Durhame* fra ou^ redemption.vii.c.xxxiiii eris. Ane co^tenion is it betuix the
Italianis and Albianis concerning the place quhare sanct Bid was borne. Ye
Italianis sayis he was borne in Ianis and buriit in the samyn, and his
sepulture is yair it i^ great veneration, in quhat sumeuir place he deceissit or

Northumberland, and vsit oftymes in Melros, quhilk is ane abbay of good
religious men in scotland, and deceissit in ye time of king Ethfyne of quhom
sall be our nixt hystory.

Of king Ethfyne, and how he maid four regentis to govern his realm, of great
cruelteis done be Donald of the Ilis* and of the deith of king Ethfyne. Ca.
xxvii.
MOrdak buriit in Colmekyll, ane conuention was maid be the noblis, and Ethfyne

and peace, and kepit the band maid before with Britonis Inglismen and Pichtis be
Mordak and Eugenius* he purgit his realm of al misdoares and set his labor
both to ye defense of his liegis and honor of religion. Thus grew ye scottis
in riches and honest maneris. All theuis, reiffaris, and sawaris of displesour
ama^g ye noblis and co^monis put down and punist be his Justice. and fynaly he
was ha^din i^ sic reverence and dredour for his virtew, yt na man durst nor
mycht say of reason any displesand wordis of him. Quhil at last he fell i^ age

with sic justice as it was gidit afor be ye king. For ilkane of yam labourit sa
besal^ for yair freindis yt yai had na respect to Justice. Throw quhilk ye
noblis and other oung men returnit to their ald insolence to the great damage
of polecy and common weill of their realm. Donald of ye Ilis ane man of strange

realm. it he wald not punis yir cruelteis done be donald. vncertan quhidd he
was iunit to him in blude or participant with him in the proffet of his
reiffis. The co^monis brocht to Uter heirschippis and powerte complenit to
Mordak in may lamentable wise. And desyrit restitution of their guddis. And
because the king was that time in extreme malady, nane was to put remeid to
their displesouris. The commonis oppressed with their sorowis and seand na remeid
rasit their handis to the heuyn, and complenit their miserijs amang yame self.
Bot ay the mair they complenit, the mair cruelte followit be this Donald.
Apperit thus na esperance of tranquillite, quhill at last king Ethfyne
deceissit the.xxx. eir of his regne, and was burijt in Colmekyll the eir of
god.vii.C.lxii. eris.

Of king Eugenius the ^viii. and how he was slane for his tyranny. and his
evil counsalouris hyngit on Iebatis. Ca. xxviii.
After ye deith of Ethfyne, Eugenius ye.viii. son to Mordak was maid king. In
ye beginning he semit ye mair plesand yt he ceissit not quhill these Donald and
his complicis war punist to the deith in presence of the pepyll for their
demeritis. And it the king was nocht full sithit with his Justice, bot with
mair rigor punist Mordak to the deith, because he was alliat to ye said Donald
and participant with him in his treason. Sic thingis done, king Eugenius
accusit ye remane^t rege^tis Dowald Collan and Co^raith. and because they mycht
have sauit ye pepil fra trubil done to yame and was found necligent thairintyl
during ye kingis infirmite. They payit great sowmis to ye kingis proffet i^
redemption of their lyuis. Throw yir punitionis ye realm was pecifiit in all
pertis, and the king had in sic dredour to his pepyll, yt na rebellion apperit
to rise amang ye co^monis during his time. The pepil beleuit to have got tyn
ane good prince, quhen this Eugenius began to regne above yame, bot as often
occurris ye ingyne of man is mair procliue and reddy to evil werkis tha^ to
good. These Eugenius haua^d his empire under la^g peace and sleuth fell in may
schamful vices ragea^d i^ mair lust than semit to any man. He was ane fulear of
virginis and nobill matronis deliting in na thing mair tha^ in bordellis and
tauernis* he luffit nane bot yame only ye couth bring hi^ moniest co^cubinis to
nures him i^ new lu^t and plesour. throw quhilk he i^cressit ylk day in mair
vice, and become sa auaricius, yt he regardit nothir ye law of god nor man and
slew sindry true me^ of hes realm both spiritual and temporal be vane causis
to co^ques yair la^dis and riches to sustene ane cu^pany of vicius li^maris
about him. bot his cruelte and vicius dedis war not la^g vnpunist, for ye
noblis sea^d yt he micht not be refrenit fra sic enormiteis and scha^full
werkis, and seand yt he had nothir ye censouris of haly kirk nor god in
reverence, co^spirit haistely aganis hi^. and slew him in ye tolbuth, quhare he
was persewa^d ane true man to ye deith for his awin geir. Sine tuk his
familiaris quhilk assistit to his unhappy dedis, and hingit yam on Iebatis to
ye great plesour of ye pepill. This end maid Eugenius ye.viii. ye third eir of
his regne. His body was ordanit to be cassin i^ ane closet, or ellis be deuorit
with hundis and raue^nous beistis. nochtheles (ye sic thingis should not succeid
to na les scham of his a^tecessores tha^ posterite) his bodi be license of his
noblis was brocht to colmekil, and buriit amang ye sepultures of other kings.

Of the vicius king Fergus the third. and how he was slane be his wife. Of
her orison maid to the counsal. and how scho slew her self. Ca. xxix.
FErgus the third of yat name and son to king Ethfyne was maid king after deith
of Eugenius the viii. and was nocht far discrepant fra maneris of Eugenius
ye.viii. for he become ane drunkin glotoun with sic effeminar lusts, that he
necleckit the administration of his realm, and tuke plesoure of nane bot of
s^udlaris, insaciabyl dru^kettis, and sic vicius and detestabyl personis. He
was hatit with all virtius pepyll, and had ane great nowmer of huris followyng
on him, and held thaym in sic familiarite with him that he lichtlijt and
contempnit his awin wife, and brocht her to sic penurite that scho was
constranit to serve other nobyl weme^ for her suste^tation. This woman
impacient to suffer sic iniuris come syndry times to the king and prayit him to
amend his life, gif he desyrit to have lang empire and schew (gif he continewit
in adultre) he sall nocht eschew deuyne punitioun quhen he leist wenit. The
king na thing regardyng her wordis ceissit nocht ylk day to rage in mair
insolence. At last the queen s^and her self defraudit of the det of matrimony,
thocht bettir was to her to be wedow, than to leif in daily co^temptioun amang
their concubinis. And fynaly scho slew the king sleipand in his bed, the third
eir of his regne. His body was brocht on the morrow in the counsall house to
search be diligent inquisitioun, quha durst attempt sa great cruelte. Money of
the kyngis freindis and seruy^ouris comperit in Iug^ment with sorrowful chere,
desyring the werkaris of these cruelte to be serchit with may diligence. And
because na man had suspicion of the queen to persew her husband with any
displesoure. Money of ye kyngis familiaris were taken, and be scharp questionis
demandit and syndry punist with importabyll tormentis. The queen heirand their
innocent men punist for the crime yt scho committit, come haistely to the
counsall and said in this wise. I know nocht (my tender pepyl) quhat conscience
me accusis, nor quhat deuyne vengeance esfrayis me with syndry thochtis. For all
this day and nicht bygane my mind and body is aflocht, specially sen I hard
their innocent men sa cruelly tormentit. For gif my Ira had nocht been mesit be
sum temperance, I had wrocht my self may schameful displesoure. the kyngis
slauchter is my deid. conscience persuadis me for heil of my saul to schaw the
verite, that their innocent men be nocht punist for the crime yt I co^mittit.
Understand thairfore, yt their men that e accuse ar innocent of his deith. for I
am scho that slew king Fergus with my cursit hands this las^ nycht be
impacience of Ire and lust quhilkis ar two may sorrowful broddis amang weme^.
For he defraudit me of my lawful bed vsyng his i^moderat lust with other
weme^, thus quhen na esperance nor it persuasionis apperit to recounsall him to
my desyris, Sic huge and bryme fury raise in me, quhil I was tyistit to do this
cruelte, thynka^d mair plesand to remove occasion of adultry and to be
destitute of my husband than to leif perpetually defraudit of his bed, and
iniurit be their spous brekaris. assoile heirfore their men that e accuse of his
deith, and to punys me quhilk is ye only werker of yis murdir salbe na great
laubour. I yat did this felony sal tak punition on my self. Skarslie were their
wourdis said quhen scho in presence of the pepill or they mycht aduert dang her
self with ane dager to the heart, and fell down deid before the pepill. Money of
the peppil had great wonder of her co^stance, and louit her conscience, because
scho reuelit ye hyd treason to deliver ye innocent men fra yair deith, and slew
her self to preuene ye schame and displesoure yt was apperand to her. Otheris
thocht nane of her doingis apprisable, bot repugnant to ye law of god and
nature. Saying it was nocht leifful to any person to reueil yair awin nor it
other mennis treasoun. And may detestable of all innaturally to sla thaym
self. Quhill the pepill was at this disputatioun the body of Fergus was
co^mandit be the nobillis to be brocht to Colmkill. Quhair it was buryit. Fra
the incarnatioun.vii.C.lxvii. eris. The body of the queen (because scho slew her
self) was inhibit to lie in cristin beriis.

Of king Soluathius and how he dan^^t sundry great lymmaris of his realm. of
his deith and of money haly men. Ca. xxx.
FErgus buriit on yis wise, Soluathius son of Eugenius ye.viii. was maid king
ane noble prince and abill till have done money nobill actis in his realm, gyf
the weirdis had been propiciant. In the third eir of his regne, He tuk ye gout
throw vehement called that he consauit before in his hunting. This infirmyte fell
so sare in his iuncturis and lethis of his body, yat he mycht nocht do the
chargis pertenand to ane good king. For it co^tine wit with him to the end of
his life. And because the king was vexit with sic infirmite, money great trubillis
followit in the realm. The first trubill raise be Banus capitane of ye I Will of
Tire. For he gaderit ane cumpany of lymmaris. And tuke all the strenthis of the
Ilis and callit him self king. And nocht lang after he come with money lang
faddis in Kyntyre and Lorne, and maid heirschippis and slauchter in all partis
quhare he come. The king commouit at their attemptatis, send Douchquhall
capitane of Athole, and Culane capitane of Argile with certane chosin men in
the Ilis. And yat with small impediment put this Banus and his cumpany to
flicht. And drove thaym be lang chase in ane strait coif of Lorne within ane
crag above ane river deip but any furdes. This coif had na out passage. Thus
behunit their men yt fled to the coif return the samyn gait they come. Banus
with his cumpany dreuin in this coue be adventure maid him to return (as he
come) bot he fand the gait closit with his ennymes. Nocht yeles he socht money
ways to eschew and quhen he had passit the day in sindry opinionis, and finding
na thing proffitable. He arrayit ane wache within the nycht for defense of his
cumpany. Finalie he was dreuin to sic penurite, because he had na vittallis to
sustene him yt he send messengeris, desyring license to depart in the Ilis, his
life saif. At last seand nocht ellis bot repuls of his desyris, he arrayit his
folkis and come aganis Douchquhall and Culane in ye brekyng of day and was
slane with all his cumpany to be ane notable exempill in times cumyng. Quhat
fruit followis of rebellioun aganis yair prince. Eft yis victory Douchquhall
and Culane went in ye Ilis. and pecifyit the cuntre of all tru^yll as they
plesit. Nocht lang after raise ane new trubyll in Galloway be Gyllequham son of
Donald, quhilk was iustifyit (as we schew) be Eugenius the.viii. Nochtheles
this trubyll was pecifyit with small labor, fra the heiddismen (be quhom ye
first occasioun raise) war punist. At this time raise great seditioun betuix the
Saxonis in Ingland and the Bry^onis in Walis. For multitude of kyngis, syndry
lawis. Lang peace and riches generit discord, and the Pich^is war not but cyuyl
debait amang thaym self. Thus was sa great sedition amang the Albianis, that
they micht not invade their nichtbouris. King Soluathius during this time had
his realm in good tranquillite be prudent industry of his nobyllis. and all
boundis thairof weill obeysant to his empire. with na les Justice than he had
passit in proper persoun throw his realm. And deceissit the xx. eir of his
regne. Fra the incarnatioun.viii.C.lxxxvii. eris. In their days war money clerkis
of singular eruditioun and life. As Macharius bischop of Abirdene to quhom^
the cathedral kirk is dedicat. Diuinicus archedene, Congane and Dunstane
abbotis. Their and money other their disciplis war precheouris and lanternis of
haly kirk. Sum authouris writis their haly men war in other kyngis days. Bot we
vary na thing fra out first purpos, following Ueremond and Campbell, both in
the history and the dai^ as we promittit, And sa endis heir the.ix. buke of
their croniklis.

Heir begynnis the Tent Buke of the croniklis of Scotland:
Of king Achaius and how he agreit his nobillis of all contentionis. Of his
message send to the princis of Ireland, and of their answer. How money Ireland
men perist in the seyis. How the Scottis and Ireland men war aggreit. Ca. i.
SOluathius beand deceissit on this wise* Achaius son of Ethfyne was maid king.
This prince in ye beginning of his empire set him to meis all discord and
seditionis amang his nobillis. For he traistit na thing sa plesand for the
felicite of his realm as to bring his nobyllis and commonis to concord. This
trubyll being mesit, apperit ane other of greter motioun betuix Ireland and the
Ilis. Ane cumpany of Ireland me^ maid certane heirschippis in Kyntyre. And
incontine^t all ye pepyll of the Ilis ruschit haistely to harnes, and slew ane
great nowmer of their Ireland men. Than Achaius (to preuene all trubyl that mycht
follow be this last bergane) send his ambassatouris to ye princis of Ireland
schewyng him aduertist that Ireland men (fra quhome the Scottis tuke their
beginning) was purposit to cum haistely to invade his realm to the great
damage of the two pepill quhilk hes been sa lang togiddir confiderat under ane
blud and amyte. And schew it was na sufficient cause of battall to nychtbouris
and freindis to inuaid other with battall howbeit ilk theif reif other. And
thairfore gyf the Ireland men were mair desirus of peace than weir and glaid to
keip ye auld band hail, the Scottis wald persevere in kyndnes with thaym. Be
contrar gif yai desyrit battall erar than peace. And nocht resolute quhat was
best to be done, he desyrit thaym with degest counsall to auise, quhat trubill
and sorrow mycht follow be their weris. And sen peace was finalie necessar, to
auyse quhiddir it were mair plesa^d before the weris or eftir. Or mair profitable
to have peace, quhen n^ displesoure were precedent. Or quhen both yair realms
were brokin with athiris iniuris. The princis of Ireland (nochtwithstandyng yir
humyl wourdis) answerit, thai should sustene all chargis sa vaileantlie, yat na
aduersite sall follow. And thairfore yai wald have na peace with Scottis,
quhill the iniuris done be thaym in Kyntyre were redressit or reuengit with mair
skaith. They were als profundlie auisit quhat proffit or damage mycht follow be
yair weris, and had prouisioun of all thyngis necessar, aganis quhat sumeuir
chance of fortoun yat mycht follow. And youcht yir weris were of litil proffet,
it yai war sa accustomit thairwith yt they wald use ye samyn as their elderis
did before. Quhen yir ambassatouris were returnand be ye Ireland seis in
scotland. And ye scottis traisting na thing les yan battall be Ireland. Ane
flote of Ireland men arriuit in ye Ilis. and ceissit fra na manner of cruelteis
on the inhabitantis thairof. At last quhen they had heryit ye cuntre, and
makand thaym to return hame ladyn with infinite guddis, sic ane storm raise be
violence of ye heuin, yat few of thaym eschapit vnperist in ye seis. King
Achaius heirand yis calamyte falling to Ireland men be Just punitioun of god
(for they inuadit his realm within the trety of peace) concludit to assail
yam na forthir with sic desyris, and beleuit thaym sa brokin be yis forsaid
trubil, yt they should seik peace at him. And as ye king co^iecturit, sa
followit. For the Ambassatouris of Ireland come to him at Inuerlochte,
co^fessand the manifest punition falling on yame be justice of god for ye
wrangis be yame done to scottis, and prayit Achaius to gif peace to yame,
quhilk they refusit a fore to gyf be their insolence. to their ambassatouris
answerit Achaius. Youcht Ireland men were obstinat and mycht not understand yair
proffet, quhill they sufferit affliction, and refusit oftymes sic things as
been may proffitable for yam. it he wald not be repugnant to reason, sen he
saw thaym (yat were his ennymes for yat time) be Justice of god punyst for yair
offense, to be exempil to al pepil quhat vengeance falls on yame, yat inuadis
yair nychtbouris but just tityll of battal. Heirfore to schaw him serua^d of
crist (quhilk co^me^dit peace sa gretumlie to ye weil of mortal pepill) he wald
set aside both recent and ald iniuris, and have peace with yame youcht yai
deseruit not. Ye ambassatouris depeschit on yis manner, returnit hame reiosing
of ye peace grantit to yame. and ye scottis were not vnglaid yairof, haua^d
experience be la^g use, quhat damage or pleseir may follow be weris of uncouth
realms.

How king Charlis send his ambassatouris to be confiderat with scottis and
pichtis. of their orison maid to king Achaius, and of the orisoun maid aganis
thaym be Culmane. Ca. ii.
IN ye mean time Charlis the Main king of France and roman empriour, set his
mind with vter power to distroy the ennymes of cristin faith. Eft yt he vndstude
Inglisme^ be victory of britonis brocht to sic insolence, yt they trubillit
both ye Almane and Franche seis. and su^tyme exercyng sic cruelteis and
heirschippis on France, ye marchandis mycht have na passage be see or land, to
dant this insolence of Inglismen (yat yai ^^ll nocht have power to inuaid the
^^anche and almane seis in times cummyng king Charlis be decreit of hes
nobillis tuke purpos to be co^fiderat with scottis and pichtis under yi^
conditionis. Als often as Inglismen ^u^is (...) ^ne army in france. Ye sco^tis
and pichtis sal inuaid Ingland. Gif Inglismen inuaidis scottis and pichtis, ye
franche m^n on ye manner sall inuaid Ingland. To dres this matter were ^e^d
ambassatoures out of france to king Achaius. And quhen yai were brocht to his
presence, ane of thaym said in yis manner. Rycht illuster prince were nocht
Charlis the Main ye glore and protectoure of Catholic religion aganis
sarazenis, knawis be experience franchemen fauorit to the and thy pepill. He
had nocht send ws for sic things as we will desire at yis time. The fame of thy
good name to wart the cristin faith, and eik thy benevolence schawin to
marchandis of our cuntre (quhen they travel in yi^ bou^dis) mouit ws the
ambassatouris of king Charlis to cum to the with the more confidence. We belief
it is not unknown to thy hienes i^ qhuat extreme dangeir the catholic pepill
hes stand their money eris in Italy France and Spane be cruelte of sarazenis the
ennymes of god, quhat nowmer of pepill been slane thairwith? quhat la^dis and
townis brint and brocht to vter euersioun? quhat nobill cietezanis been brocht
to importable servitude? And because sa great trubill risis daily aganis the
Cristin pepill, The may Catholic prince Charlis hes votit him to the deith in
defense thairof aganis the ennymes of god. Desyring na thing more arde^tlie,
yan to bring his mind to ^ic fine, that cristin pepill may be deliuerit fra
truble of sarazenis, and kirk men restorit to their first institutioun, and
dredis na thing sa mekill as to be empeschit fra his hailsu^ purpos be
seditioun risyng amang cristin princis. For now diverse pepepill as Saxonis,
Frisonis, Normannis and Inglismen (quhilkes ar of Saxonis blude) hes be
manifest tyranny conquest the realm of Britane inuadyng ye pepill both be see
and land with vntellable cruelteis. To dant their attemptatis, and to abandoun
thaym in times cumyng that they sall nocht inuaid France nor this thy realm
with sa bludy incursionis as they did before. King Charlis of France be
deliuerit mind of his nobillis desyris to be confiderat with the and thy pepill
under sic fallowschip, that Franchemen sall support Scottis, and Scottis
Fra^chemen, gyf it happynnis Inglisme^ to inuaid any of thaym. Thus may the
iniure of Inglismen the may auaricius pepill i^ ^rd be best eschewit to both
the pepill. For their reasonis I believe e (may vaileant pepill) quhom god hes
defendit sa lang vnbrokin fra our rich and strange ennymes, will be favorable
to their honorable desyris of king Charlis. And support ws als weil aganis
Inglismen, as aganis ye ennymes of cristin faith. For the co^modite heirof sall
finalie succeid na les to our weil, tha^ to ouris. The ambassatouris eftir this
orison was ressauit in ye kyngis palyce with all honor and magnificence that
mycht be deuisit. In the mean time raise ane strange disputatioun amang the
nobillis, quhiddir it was proffitable or nocht for the co^moun weill of
Scotland, to be confiderat (as the ambassatouris desyrit) with France. Money
noblis were variant in their opinioun. And yair fore their ambassatouris were send
to pas their time at the huntis with other nobillis, quhill the counsall were
resoluit in this difficill matter. Than Culmane capitane of Mar said to ye
cou^sal on yis manner. I have na admiration (may nobil prince) howbeit thy
pepill desires to be co^fiderat with France, beleuand na thing sa good, sa
honest nor sa plesand for their co^moun weill, as to be confiderat with the
may rich pepill yis day in Europe. For throw this societe and alliance ye
Scottis sall rise of great fame and reverence in all partis of ye world.
Nochtheles all this co^modite and plesour yt now cumis (as apperes) be yis
band, salbe of lityl estimatioun in respect of the heavy and irrecouerable
damage ye sal follow thairthrow to ws eftir. Ye mischeuus end be my opinioo^
sall schaw to our posterite, how far we in our p^sent dayis were aberrand fra
yair common weil i^ making of yis ba^d with france. Quhat other fruit may we have
to be co^fiderat with france aganis. Ingland our daily nychtboures (quhais
freindschip was may plesand to ws) bot only to make our nixt nychtbouris our
stra^gest fayis, and our freindis seuerit fra ws be ye braid seis. At quhais
plesoure we man move battall contrar our nixt nychtbouris, and ieoperd our
bodyis landis and gudis to extreme dangeir for ye weil of yame, quhilkes ar far
seuerit fra our support. Heirfor I think sen ye matter is sa hie, and appera^d
mair to our singular damage tha^ any co^modite, we should be sa profou^dly
resoluit, yt we seik na sic colourit honor nor improffitabil glore, yt may
prouoik our nixt nichbouris to frequent weres, and cause ws to tyne schamefully
our landis and liberteis, quhilkis been sauit sa money eris before be our nobyl
antecessouris. Quhat may be deuisit mair skaithfull to fre pepill? than to
ieoperd yair realm (quhe yai have it in peace) upon ye chance of battal, or to
thirle yame wylfully to servitude of uncouth pepil. Gif fra^cheme^ brek ye band
of co^fideration within ye fury battal mouit be us only for yair cause, and
sine be confiderat with our nichtbouris and daily ennymes, leuand ye hail preis
of batal on ws. How sal ye great damage and iniuris sustenit in our weris
aganes Inglisme^ be tha^ redressit* Have we riches and strenth to recover yir
displesouris on francheme^, after yt we are brokin be yair weres, and brocht
neir to vter exterminion. Attour gyf we happin to be brocht in to sic calamite
yt our gudis ar waistit and our pissance brokin, and franchemen co^fiderat with
Inglismen in our contrar. How sal we than resist Inglismen? Quhome sall we than
accuse for violation of the band betuix ws and france? siclik gif we be
confiderat (as is deuisit) with france, we salbe i^ daily bergan of ennymes,
and sendyll have consolation of freindis. we sall have frequent weris with
ennymes, And neuir find our (...) bot throw lang passage and dangerus seis* na
marcha^dice salbe brocht to ws out of france, spane, nor almany, Bot be
tollerance of Ingl^smen. Yus sal ou^ marchandis be so destitut, that they sall
have na ress^^it nor port, quhen dangeir or stormis inuadis yame. Yus sall they
other peris for fal^ of refuge in ye stormy seis, or ellis tyne their schippis
and guddis and be ra^derit in yair ennymes handis. Be their reasonis apperis
(nobill prince) quhat skaith and damage sall follow to be co^fiderat with
France. Best is yairfore to perseueir in ye auld band with pichtis, britonis
and Inglismen, as our eldaris did before, quhil^is knew al ye fruit y^ mycht cum
to thaym be any ba^d of france. And sen our vaileant and nobill eldaris mycht
neuir find ye band of France proffi^abill for their common weill, I think ^e
should leave on ye samyn manner as ya^ did, and na co^fideration to be maid with new
and uncouth pepyll, les tha^ we wylfully list ieoperd our realm, our lyuis and
gudis but any respect to our awi^ weil for ye luf allanerly of france.

Of the answer maid to this last orison be A^biane. How France and scotland
war perpetually co^fiderat. How ^ichtis refusit to be confiderat with
France, and of the articles contenand y^ band betuix scotland and france. Ca.
^ii.
SIndry of the noblis tuke great indignatioun at th^^ wordis of Culmane. For
they thocht it was both necessare and honest to thaym to have societe and band
with France. (...) ane nobyll man namit Aldiane cap^tane of ye Ilis said in
this wise. Gyf the four pepyl that dwellis now in Albion namit Brytonis*
Scott^s, Saxonis and Pychtis ^icht leave togider under ane m^nd and peace, or
(...) we miche be fickeris leave i^ peace with Inglisme^ be te^nour of yair (...)
or faith. I think the counsal geuyn be Culmane war not vnproffitab^l, nor it
should be refusit. For tha^ we micht have na occasion nor motive to seik
co^fideration of uncouth pepyl. Bot sen their was neuir found be na pepyl mair
falset and treason, tha^ scottis, pichtis, and britonis hes found be saxonis. I
think it necessar other to have co^tinewal weir aganis na les falset than weir
of Inglismen, or ellis to be confiderat with the pepyll yt may support ws
aganis their perpetual invasion. Quhidder ac their doingis faith or desait?
quhen ye britonis had brocht the saxonis in their realm to defend yame fra
yair ennymes, and eft yat they had tretit yame in ye may tender manner yai
miche, and rewardit yame with great honor and riches. Yir treasonabil saxonis
turnit yair minds fra amite to feid and hatre^t, and s^hew yam self may

armor and wappinnis aganis ye said britonis, and nocht allanerly inuadit yam
with infinite slauchter, bot spuleit yame of their realm and honouris. Quhat
band or co^fideration hes haldin their saxonis at peace with any pepyl i^ times
bygane? They ly ay in wait to tak yair nichtbouris at auantage but any respect
to faith or band as the time accu^ris. Quhat misery and trubyl is fallyn to the
britonis be dissait of saxonis? How oftymes hes ye saxonis brokin (quhen we
beleuit leist) the peace betui^ ws and pichtis ^thay ar contending now amang
yame self mair be treason and falset, th^n any honest weris. They have slane sa

eris slane be Oswane. And Osw^ne be Os^ik, and money other kingis of
Northumberland in ye samyn manner war ay fynaly murdrist be their successouris.
Attour Inglismen hes na ^es contention in all pertis (quhare ya^ haf now their

THe Scottis irkit with frequent iniuris of pichtis as ye fine of all weris is,
set ane conuention with pichtis to redres all skaithis sa far as micht be on
every side. In ye quhilk they war fynaly agreit on al debaitis, and that the
samyn should perpetually endure* Hungus king of pichtis gaif his sister
Fergus^ane in marriage to king Achaius, quhilk had ane son to him namit
Alpine, Athelstane king of Ingland rycht desyrus to eik the boundis of his
realm, come with ane army in the landis of Mers and Berwik pertena^d to
pichtis, and alliegit the samyn to pertene to his empire, and reft before fra
Northumbrianis be iniure of pichtis. And quhen he had ceissit fra na manner of
cruelte and heirschyppis in the said landis, he returnit with great pray of
guddis in Northumberland* to dant ye rebellion of certane Inglismen quhilkis
war laitly conspirit aganis him. Hungus king of Pichtis impacient to suffer
their iniuris, send ambassatouris to Achaius desyryng support to resist his
ennymes. Achaius sone eft send.x.M. chosin me^ to king Hu^gus to ye said
effect. Than Hungus rasit his army in Northumberland and inuadit it with sindry
cruelteis. and returnit with great pray of guddis in Lowthyane. king Athelstane
to dant this attemptatis come in Louthiane with mair diligence tha^ was
beleuit, and followit hait fute on the Pichtis. In the mean time ye Pichtis had
set down their tentis beside ane burn nocht two mylis fra Haddyngtoun, and war
aduisand amang thaym self how ye spule laitly gottyn be thaym out of
Northumbirland should be partit be richt of arms, and traistyng na thing les
than the cumyng of Inglismen. Athelstane weill aduertist of the counsall of
Pichtis come forthwart with arrayit oistis, and co^mandit be opin proclamation
na Pichtis to be saiffit. The Pichtis astonist be this cry, and seand sic
multitude of pepil aganis yame began to muse quhat chance of fortoun should
thairefter follow. Nochtheles be command of Hungus ylk man eid to array,
traistyng the curage and pray (quhylkis war laitly ^eft be this last iornay)
should be occasioun to break the array of their ennymes, and tuke aduysement al
ye day, how they micht best eschew the dangeir appering. And yocht the armyis
on every side stude may awfully arrayit in otheris sicht. it nane o^ yame
durst invade other for ye day. In the nycht followyng the Pichtis concludit to
assail the chance of battall, and other to have victory or ellis all at anis
to de. On the morrow after their first sleip they went to yair confession and
prayaris, and askit help of Crist, and sanct And^o their patron, to support
yame his special pepyll aganis yair ennymes. king Hu^gus beand on sleip,
apperit ye appostil sanct Andro and bad him be of good comfort hauand good hope
in god. for he should have on ye morrow ane glorius victory of Inglismen. It is
said yat ane schinand croce was seen in ye lift straucht above the army of
Pichtis not onlik to ye samyn croce yt the appostil deit on. This croce vanist
neuir out of ye lift quhil ye victory succedit to Pichtis. king Hungus
awalkynnit out of his sleip, fand hes army behalding this croce with great
adm^ration. and incontinent he callit yame to his standart and schew his
visioun to yame with all circumstance before rehersit. Incontinent raise ane huge
noyis and clamor throw al ye army of scottis and Pychtis. The Inglismen war
richt affrayit for this noyis, and mair affrayit seand ye croce schinand with
awful bemis in ye lift. For it apperi^ to yame for ane evil sign. At ye brek
of ye day king Hungus arrayit his folkis, and be sound of trumpat gaif ye sign
of iunyng criand with schyll voce sanct Andro our patron be our help. The
Scottis and pichtis rasit be their wordis, come on their ennymes with sic fury,
that they war finaly vincust, and gaif backis. On quhome followit the Scottis
and pichtis with lang chase, and maid mair slaucht tha^ was maid before in ye
battal. The prysoneris (quhilkis were taken before be Inglismen) seand ye scottis
and pichtis victorius, inuadit yair ennymes with mair cruelteis tha^ did yair
maisteres yt wan ye victory. Sa far enragit yis slauchter ye skarsly of al yis
army of Ingland war left.v.C. men on live. king Athelstane at ye first iunyng
was schot throw ye body with ane spear and slane with sindry noblis of England.
The place (quhare he was slane) is callit it Athelstane furd. king Hungus after
yis victory be sound of tru^pat callit his me^ to ye standar^, and stud al ye
nicht arrayit quhill ye morrow, and tha^ partit the spule of ye field be rite of

thyngis done, king Hungus with all his victorius army went bair fute to ye kirk
of sanct Andro to tha^k god and his appostyll of this glorious victory, and
maid solempnit ^ote yt he and his posterite sall use na ansene in times cumyng
(quhe^ time of battal occurrit) bot ye ^ro^e of sanct Andro. This custom
remanit not only to ye pichtis, bot als with scottis after ye exterminion of
pichtis. Be yis victory ye scottis gat not only rich spuleis of enymes, bot
als great rewardis be Hungus, and returnit hame with great honouris. Hungus for
his excellent victory b^ildit ye kirk of sanct Andro may richely be his
magnificence, and (...) it with mair nowmer of preistes for deuyne secuyce, and
gaif to it money (...) Io^ ^llis of gold and silver. He ma^d ye image of Crist
and his.xii. app^st^llis of fine gold and silver to re^ane in ye said kirk in
perp^tual memory of this victory. He gaif ye te^n^is of all manner of frutis
growand within his realm to sustene kirkme^. And co^mandit that nane of yame he

s^bir frutis as they had before ye empire of Hungus. Thus war ye kirkm^n re^^
fra all their liberteis and possessionis geuyn to yame before be Hungus, and
yair landis geuyn to his familiaris. The noblis co^discendit weil yairto,
traisting all thing (geuyn to ye kirk) na les tynt. than they war fallyn in
pray to yair ennymes. Their excorsionis done aganis kirkmen, succedit to the
great infelicite of Pichtis. For it was the cause yat they war brocht within few
eris after to v^er exterminion as we sal sone heir. King Achaius had his realm
i^ good peace and deceissit ye.xxxii. eir of his regne, fra our

Glaciane, Modane, and Medane great doctouris and me^ of singular erudition. In
ye time of king Achaius ye Roman empire was deuidit i^ two senorijs. for king
Charlis was empriour of the west part of the world, and Constantine empriour of

any deuinite war hid in yame, bot to represent the figoure of god and his

COnuallus decei^sit on this manner, succedit his cousing Dongallus son of
Soluathius afor reheirsit. Syndry scottis seand this prince inclinyt to
Justice, maid hortation to Alpyne son of Achaius to tak ye crown. Traisting
the extorsionis do^e be thaym to the co^monis should be vnpunist be ye way. And
because he was nocht sa delige^^ (as they desyrit) they come on him with awful
mannassyng. And swore (gyf he tuke nocht haistely ye crown) they should slay him.
Alpyne astonist of his life come with ane great nowmer of pepill in Argyle to
take the crown. Nochtheles dredand great trubill to appeir in ye realm be his
rebellioun, he fled with two tendir seruitouris to king Dongallus, and was sa
plesandlie ressauit, that Dongallus promittit (gyf the pepill were content) to
exoner him of the crown in favor of the said Alpyne. For he desyrit na thing
sa ^ekill as the felicite of Achaius house. Alpyne gaif him thankis. And said he
wald not ressaue the crown sa lang as Co^uallus was on live. And schew the
gaderyng of pepyll and trubyll apperyng in the cuntre was nocht mouit be him,
bot only be treason of certane conspiratouris, quhilk wald have slane him, gif
he had nocht assistit to thaym for the time. And on the third day eftir come
messengeris fra their conspiratouris to Dongallus, excusing thaym and putting all the treason on Alpyne. Nochtheles ye king gave litil faith thairto. And maid
sic deligence, that he come on their conspiratouris, quhen they beleuit na thing

DOngallus perist in this manner, Alpyne son to Achaius was maid king. Als sone
as he was crownyt, he set his deligence to provide al thingis necessar for his

to make his provision for ordinance of battal, traistyng be deith of Dongallus
sum bett chance to follow to his weris. and but more tarry he tuke purpos with
ane cu^pany of chosin men to pas in Angus, quhare ye remane^t army of pychtis
was co^ma^dit be him to co^uene. i^ before his cumyng the scottis were campit in
ye same place quhare his co^ue^tion was set, and began to sege the castle of
Forfair. On ye third day eftir king Feredech come with ane army weil arrayit to

and sum time saiffit agane be ye wageoures. At last king Feredech s^and ye
myddil ward of pichtis approcheand to disco^fitoure, ruschit with sic farde amang
his ennymes, yat he was excludit fra his awin folks. And quhen he saw na way
to eschew, he faucht with perseuerand manheid to the deith. and was slane with

pychtis na thing astonist of this slaucht perseuerit in continewal battal,
quhil the nycht bereft thaym ye sycht. Yus were both ye armyis brokin. and
co^stranyt (as disco^fist pepil) to return to their tentis. Ye pichtis knawing
yair king and nobils with ye may pert of their army slane, left ye woundit
men behynd yame with yair carriage. and fled hame ye nerest way they mycht. The
scottis were sa brokin yt yai had fled in the same manner, were nocht it was

nouellis causit y^ pichtes to abide in array quhil ye nycht was gone* on the
morrow certane spyis were send forth to search ye wodis and montanis and fand
yair ennymes fled. Ye scottis reiosyng of this victory, partit ye spule fallin
to thaym be ryte of arms. ye body of Feredech was bur^t with solemn
cerimonijs i^ Forfair. The scottis eft yis victory fand the third part of yair
army slane. and was co^stranit yairfore to inuaid ye pichtes erar be frequent
skarmussyng, than any plane battall. Nochtheles they come sone eftir in Angus
and brocht out of ye samin ane huge pray of cornis and guddis to Athole, and ye
remane^t put in fire. Be yir and other frequent heirschippis Angus was left
waist. Ye pichtis to resist yir iniures, chesit Brudus son of Feredech to be
king. quhilk for his febill and soft administration was haldin i^ more derision
yan honor to his pepil, and was slane ye first eir of his regne be ane fenei^
sedition amang ye pichtis. Eftir the slaucht of Brudus hes brodir Ke^neth was
maid king. and had lityll better chance yan Brudus had. For eft ya^ he was
cumyn in Angus with ane army of pichtis, he tuk sic feir ^eand hes ennymes
fornentis him, yt h^ ^aif of his cote armor and fle^ fra his army to ye nixt
montanis, quhare he was schamefully slane be ane landwart man, not knawing
quhat he was. Ye remanent pichtis knawing g^^t difficulte to meit yair ennymes
but ane he^d, chesit Brudus ane feirs and vaileant prince to be yair king. Yis
Brudus eft his coronation send ambassatouris to king Alpine, desiring all
iniuris to be redressit on athir side, and peace to be renewit, after ye auld
ba^d (...) ye two pepyl. It was answerit ^e Alpine he wald have na peace, quhil
ye crown of pichtis were geuyn to him, as just heritour yairof. Brudus seeing yt
the scottis war set to perseueir in battall aganis him, send his oratouris with
great sowmes of money to be confiderate with Edwi^e king of Ingland, and to have
certane wage (...) of Ingland to resist ye scottis. ^ing Edwine ressa^it yis
money, and promittit (quhat day Brudus list assign) to cu^ to his support.
Sindry of ye pichtis reiosit of this answer, ^raisting be support of Inglismen
to v^^cus ye scottis Otheris thocht little confidence to be geuyn to yame,
because ye said pichtis slew Athelstane king of Ingland, with money of his noblis
before in Lowthyane. In ye mean time ye scotts heri^t al Angus fra ye fute of
Granebene to ye watter of Tay. Brudus to revenge (...) cruelteis send ane
herald to king Edwyne desiring his army to be send haistely to resist ye
scottis. It was answerit be king Edwyne, yt he was sa impeschit with civil
weris ama^g his awin pepil, yt he micht make na support to him at ye time, and
als he was ^equestit be Lowis king of France to do na iniure to scottis, and to
support na pepyl in yair co^trar. Nochtheles (wald ye said Brudus superseid hes
battal quhil ye nixt eir, he should gladly cu^ to his support. Brudus ^okit on
this wise began to detest ye treason of Inglisme^, and notwithstanding his
repuls, he co^mandit al fensabil me^ of his realm to meit him ye.viii. day
after followyng with vittallis necessar for their sustentation at ye fute of ye
calidon wod. Ye pichtes war enrag^t with sic hatrent, yat few of yame were
absent at ye day and place assignit. Brudus seeing yame asse^blit with sic
hatrent come ouir ye brig of Du^keld to Angus. and in ye nicht before ye battal
be wise cou^sal of agit knichtis, he causit al ye carriage men and women (yat
come with his army) to stand in arrayit battall with lynnyn claithis above yair
bodyis, with siclik wappinis and armor as yai micht get for ye time* Sic
thi^gis done, he put ane.C. horsemen to govern yame but any noyis in ye nixt
wod, and co^mandit yat nane of yame cu^ in sicht, quhyl ye battallis war iunit.
King Alpine was at yis time in ane castle, quhilk stude on ane mote not far
fra Dunde, beside quhilk is ane plane lyand to ye North, quhare ye army of
scottis lay for ye time. Alpine beheld the pichtis on ye castle heid (quhare
he was) cumand forthwart i^ array, and incontinent he arrayit ye scottis, and
exhortit yame be la^g orison to schew yame vaileand in battall, and not only
for fei^ of schame bot for luf of yair cuntre to do sum notabyll vassalage, and
to rusche feirsly on yair ennimes, and to traist fermely but any dredour of
deith to have victory in reward of yar labouris, s^n their quarrel was just. Ye
pichtis war sa desyrus of battal, yat before ye sound of tru^pat they iunit, and
faucht with sic incredibil fury, yt ye richt wing of scottis was vehemently
trublit. Alpine seand yame abasit, come with ane cu^pany of chosin men to yair
support. Throw quhilk sindry scottis returnit fra yair fleing, and set on yair
ennymes with mair cruelte tha^ before. In the mean time ye carriage me^ and weme^
(quhilkis war hid before i^ ye wod) began to schaw yame as yai war mouand
forthwart to cu^ on yair backis, be quhais sicht ye scottis war sa affrayit yat
but any forthir debait, yai gai^ backis. on quhom followit ye pichtis with lang
chase, and slew al scottis quhare yai micht be apprehendit but any mercy or
ransoun. Yis policy and slicht of carriage me^ and weme^ hyd under covert (as we
have schawin) was mair discomfitour to ye scottis, than all the feirsnes and
strenth of pichtis. Ye horsemen of pichtis followit sa fast yat yai saiffi^ na
scottis ye micht be ouirtakin. In yis battall was tame king Alpine, and brocht
with his handis bound to ye nixt village, quhare he was heidit with ane hewing
a^, the.iiij. eir of his regne. fra ye incarnation.viii.C.xxxiiii. eres. Ye
place (quhare king Alpine was heidit) is callit it Pasalpine, yt is to say the
heid of Alpine. After yis huge victory of scottis king Brudus returnit to
Camelon with king Alpinis heid and put it on ane staik on the hyeast part of
all their wallis to be ane sign of his victory.

How Kenneth ye secou^d was maid king of scottis, of ye deith of Brudus king
of pichtis, and how Donskene was maid king. how ye heid of king Alpine was
brocht in scotland* and how the pichtis vva^ discomfist. Ca. ix.
THe scottis after yis unhappy battall, fled out of Angus in Argyle, and maid
Kenneth son of Alpine king. Ye pichtis richt insolent and proud after yis
huge victory of scottis co^uenit at Camelo^, and gaif loving to god with money
solemn cerimoniis and prayer. Als sone as ye suffrage was done, yai maid yair
aithis on ye haly euangellis neuir to ceis fra battal, quhil ye scottis were
alluterly distroyit, and maid ane statute quhat euir he war yat labourit to
have peace or trewis with ye wickit scottis, he sall be heidit. sindry of ye
pichtis thocht yir votis vnplesand, and said best was to use victory with
mesoure, nochtheles sa money as war of yis opinioun war chasit with great
displesour out of ye tempil, quhare they co^uenit. Ye scottis be this manassing
of pichtis war not deiecait, bot erar infla^mit to hie curage, traisting na
lytyl felicite to follow to yam i^ plane euersion of pichtes, as weil apperit
be yair proud insultatio^ eft yis prosperity. In ye nixt symer ye pichtes
cu^and with ane army aganis ye scottis, fell at debait ama^g yame self for ane
thing of nocht. Yus was yair army deuidit i^ sindri factionis, and fell be
iniurius wordis i^ sic slaucht, yat ye samyn micht not be sta^chit quhil ye
nicht seuerit yame. Yan brudus tuk lang co^sultation how yis discord micht be
best pecifut. nochyeles quhe^ he had taken great labor to bring his noblis to
concord, and sea^d yam not cou^salabil to ye common weil, he was co^stranit to
return hame with the residew of his army, and fell in sic malancoly, that
within few dayis after he deceissit. Ye pichtis (yat their common weil should
nocht peris for falt of ane heid) chesit Donskene brothir to king Brudus before
rehersit to be yai^ king. Yis Donskene maid concord amang his pepil, and
redressit al iniures quhare he micht. In the mean time certane vaileant Scottis
think and richt unworthy ye king Alpinis heid sul^ stand on ane staik, fen^e^t
yame to be pichtis (for they had ye la^gage) and come to Camelon as marchandis
quhare they remanit certane dayis. Als sone as they saw their ^yme, ya^ tuk

faderis heid with solemn processio^, and send it to Colmekil to be buryit
with ye remanent body, syne rewardit their men (yt did ieoperd yame to sic
honest vassalege) with rich la^dis. After yis settand his ingyne to defense of
his realm, he put strange ^^^diou^is in all strenthis ^ornentis y^ bordouris of
Pichtis. and co^mandit ^es folks to be daily exercit i^ cheualry, and to be
reddy aganis every trubyl yt mycht occur. it money of the noblis war mair set to

fra all invasion (...) pichtis, quhill ye scottis war con^^les^it, and their
pissance recouerit. and than to persew the crown of pichtis, and revenge he
slauchter of king Alpine with ^^er power. The Scottis of yis last opinion
(howbeit ya^ war of small no wi^er) war apprisit with Kenneth. And because he
saw sa hye da^geir appering to his realm, he pecifi^^ all sedition amang his
noblis, and intertenit yame with merualus affection and kindness. Followi^ three
eres with frequent incursionis but any great slaucht. In ye fourt eir Ke^neth
maid ane co^uention of his noblis, and tuk lang consultation how he micht
optene ye crown of pichtis and revenge his faderis slauchter, and schew be money
reasonis it was na time (...) than to dull in sleuth, sen they war born to
cheualry. For ye season was expedi^^ to raise their army on ye pichtis, and to
obtene ye crown thairof, quhilk hes been sa money eres iniustly haldin fra yame.
it quhe^ Ke^neth had maid al ye instance he mycht to persuade his noblis to
battall, they micht be persuadit na mair to his purpos, tha^ the samyn had been
to yair vter confusion. For ye recent slaucht of king Alpine and other noblis
slane with him before be ye pichtis, drew al their mind fra battall. Kenneth
seeing yt his noblis be na persuasion war abyll to be solistit to battall,
deuisit for yame ane uncouth slicht neuir hard before in any mannis age, and
conuenit all his noblis to ane counsall to abuyse on certane other h^^ar
materis, and feistit yame within his palice be solemn banquet, quhil it was
far run within ye nicht. Sone eft they went to yair chalmeris within his
palice, and quhe^ they war fallyn on profound sleip, Ke^neth causit sindry men
cled with fische skynnis to pas to the beddis quhare their lordis lay. Yan to ylk
lordis bed past ane of yir me al at ane set hour, ylkane of yame had i^ their
hand ane club of muscane ire, quhilk kest ane uncouth glance with y^ fische
scalis in ye myrk. In yair other hand ylkane of yame had ane bugil horn, and
spoke with sa how voce throw ye samyn, ye yair voce apperit not like to ye voce
of ane man. Ye noblis (quhare yai lay i^ yair beds) war richt astonist be yis
uncouth sicht, and not knawing quhidder ye same was visionis or dremis yai
kepit silence. Yan their men spak throw ye bugyl horn with heavy basse voce,
nocht semand as it (...) of mortal creaturis, and schew thaym angellis send be
command of god to the noblis of Scotland, to cause thaym obey the desyris of
their prince, for his desyris war sa just, yt the pychtis for the repuls
thairof sall cum to sic vter rewyne, yt na engyne nor pissa^ce of man should
resist thairto. Als sone as they had said their wordis, ylkane of yame hid their
staff under yair claithis, and inuoluit their fische skynn^s togidder to ye
fine, yt they and their lycht micht euanes both atanis. The nobillis seand
this uncouth visioun war astonist and tuke little rest for the residew of that
nicht. On the morrow after their conuentioun ylkane schew to other all their
visionis, and seand ye samyn apperyng under ane time and manner, they concludit
it to be na fantasy. Bot ane heuynly visioun send to thaym be syngular favor
of god to aduertis thaym (gyf they war respondent thairto) of yair sickir
felicite, yat was haistely to follow. Incontinent they schew to the king how
they war monist be ye angels to obtemper his will in all chargis. And thairfore
with ferme constance, they wald perseueir in battal aganis the pichtis. The
king answerit, siclik visioun of angellis apperit to him (howbeit he durst not
schaw the samyn) in adventure the pepyll should deem him glorius, as he wa^ sa
familiar with god, yt his angels should aduertis him of things to cu^.
Nochttheles se^ they war admonist in the samyn manner, he wald reueill his
vision, for it apperit to have ane good fine. The noblis condiscendit to his
mind, and be general edict co^mandit al fensable personis of ye realm to cu^
at ane certane day and place affixit with vittallis, wappin^is, and al things
necessare aganis y^ pich^es. Be yis edict was assemblit at Striuelyng ane army
of scottis with mair multitud of pipil, tha^ euir was seen before in thai
boundis. Than king Donskene to meit this battall of scottis, gaderit ane army
both of Inglismen and pichtis, and come within ye nicht betuix ye scottis and
yair awin landis. Skarsly was ye day brokin, quhen both ye armyis infla^mit
with birnand hatrent iunit but any sound of trumpat. The pichtes gat great
skaith be yair haistie and vnauisit rinning on yair ennimes. Nochtheles they
gat mair skaith be Inglismen. for they left the army of pichtis i^ these extreme
ieoperde, and fled to ye nixt mo^tanis. The reird and noyis rising be fleing of
Inglismen maid ye pichtis affrayit. king Donskene (nochtwithstanding this
disceyte of Inglismen) exhortit yame to return* they answerit it was not their
custom nor use to geif battall but capitane or but array. The pichtis (as
apperit) offerit yame wylfully to be slane with yair ennymes. It pertenit als
to ye craft of weirfair (quhe^ na espera^ce of victory apperit) to schaw
battal. The scottis seand ye myd battal nakit of ye wing (quhare yir Inglismen
should have foch^in) and reddy to ressaue iniure of ennimes, ruschit forthwart
with sic preis yt ye pichtis war co^stranit to geif backs. Tha^ Ke^nethes army
followit on yame both with futmen and horsemen, and co^ma^dit nane to be saiffit,
to revenge ye slaucht of king Alpine and his noblis, quhilkes war slane eft yt
they war oldin. Ye chase perseuerit quhil ye pichtis war dreuyn to ye watter of
Forth, quhare money of yame perist, and ye remane^t were slane be yame y^
followit. king Do^skene (after yt ye battal was disco^fist) was born away be
ane swift horse. Ke^neth dreidand su^ hid treason to follow be slycht of their
Inglysmen (quhilkis war nocht far fra their army) brocht all his folkis be
sound of trumpat to the standart, and stude all ya^ nycht in arrayit battal. On
the morrow he partit the spule of the fe^^d be rite of armis, and returnit hame.

Of the message send be Dons^ene to Kenneth and of his answer. Of the orison

KIng Donskene eftir this battall send his oratouris to Ke^neth desyryng peace.
Kenneth a^swerit he wald gladly geif peace sa yt the crown of Pichtis (quhilk
pertenit to him be just title) war geuyn ^o him* Nochtheles the Pychtis refusit
to geif peace in yat sort and, be repulse thairof gaif occasion to scottis to
invade thaym with mair cruelte than before. In the nixt eir Kenneth come with
ane army in Fyffe and Angus, and maid the inhabitantis yairof sa astonist, yt
they war sworn to leif under his empire and lawis. Sone after Kenneth tuke all
their ^^^enthis and garnist thaym in his manner. Syne rasit his camp and come to
Striuelyng to tak it in ye samyn manner. And quhen he had brocht ye Pichtis
thairof to his domi^ion, tythingis come yt all the scottis (quhilkis war left
behynd him in Fyffe and Angus) war slane be treason* Kenneth incontinent left
y^ sege of Striuelyng, and returnit in Fiffe, quhare he be fire and sw^rd left
na Pichtis (y^ micht be taken) on live to be exempyll in times cumyng, quhat
fruit succedis to mortal pepyll be violation of their faith to kyngis. Quhyl
yir and siclik inhumane cruelt^is war done amang the Scottis and Pichtis, king
Donskene conuenit all fensabyll personis of his realm but any difference of

Do^skene desyring erar to seik peace quhyll he ^lude in prosperity, than to
seik it after that he was vincust* send ane herald to king Ke^neth desyring
license to common with him before the battallis iunit of certane matteris
concerning na les ye weill of Scottis tha^ of Pichtis, kenneth refusit nocht
the co^monyng. Belyue the two kyngis accumpanyit with ane few nowmer of noblis
come fra their army to ane place as was deuisit. Than the king of Pichtis said
in this manner. It cu^mis not (invincible prince kenneth) but propiciant
favors of god, yt I ye king of pichtis (quhais pissance hes ay been equale to
Scotti^) humylly is cumyn after sa money chancis of battall desyring peace at
the. We (that hes been als often victorius on scottis as we been vincust be
thaym) ar cumyn fynaly to this point, yat other man we have peace under quhat
co^dition^s thou lift, or ellis force is to ws to perseueir in battall both in
perditioun of ws and ow. it their been syndry thyngis yat should persuade ws to
put ane end to all their weris but any ferthis invasion, as both the new and
auld affinite of our pepyll sa lang continewyng togidder under ane blude and
amyte of our antecessouris, and als the frequent cheualry of both our pepyll
sa often ieoperd to extreme dangeir aganis our ennymes, and fynaly ye vter
euersion of ws both, quhilk sall nocht fa^^ (gif we co^tinew in battall) to
cum on ws. For our ennymes seand ws brokin with ^thir iniuris sal expel ws out
of Albion with great dishonor and schame. Yair is now na occasion of battal.
Fore have not only all ye riches and treasour of Pichtis in recompensatioun of
the slauchter of king Alpyne and his nobillis. Bot als e have now all the
treasour and riches of scottis, quhilkis they tynt before be industry of king
Feredech. For their reasonis best were that we Scottis and Pychtis leiffit
content of our awin landis and rowmys, as our eldaris did before. And treit of
peace, for the chance of battall is dou^sum, and oftimis fortoun geuis victory
to thaym, that are may approchant to perell. Na thing is yairfore sa good nor
sa sickar as peace. and yt is now i^ thy handis, bot victory is in the power
of fortoun. Of quhais instable favor we have sufficient documen^ts, yat scho
conuertis oftymes hie glore in miserable estait, for e may se ws now desolate
and seikand peace, quhilkis within their few eris vincust al ye army of scotts,
quhat is he y^ will belief fortoun more propiciant to Scottis? than scho hes
been to Pychtis. Hes scho promittit ow sickir victore? quhilk scho did neuir to
any pepill before. Quhat pepil hes scho dissauit with smyland visage? quhen scho
semis may favorable, scho is may to be dred. Heirfore understand, peace to
thy great honor is better before the battall, than esperance of victory during
the battall. In adventure gif aduersite follow, thy preeminent glore and
magnitud of merciall dedis be chance of forton sall ^^key in irrecouerable
damage. Attoure yt we may have peace na les necessar to ws yan proffitable to
thy pepill, we are content that Fyffe and Angus pas under perpetual dominioun
of Scottis. To that fine yat we may reiose the remanent landis of our realm in
times cuming with thy favor and peace. Be quhilk way thou may conques
interminable honor but any damage eftir following, and be namit be yt
posterite may vailea^t prince that euir rang above the Scottis. To their
wourdis answerit Kenneth. Howbeit fortoun be na les unstable, than ye stait of
man vnsicker. And yocht our werkis and exercitionis be subieck it to variant
chance of fortoun, as may be prouin be money exemplis of our eldaris. it in
their present besynes fortoun apperis to be more sorrowful to Pichtis than to
Scottis. Because they ar to cum (as in ane wrangus action) to defraude the
Scottis of ye crown of Pychtis pertenand to thaym be Just title. Thus hes ye
Scottis just cause to persew yair rycht be battal, sen yai may optene it na
other ways. Attoure both the recent and auld affinite sa lang continewing
betuix the two pepill should move ye Pichtis (gif they had respect to their
reverence and faith) to suffir me succeid to ye crown thairof, sen it pertenis
to me be Just heritage. Be quhilk way both the pepill may have pepetuall peace
under ane king and lawis but any promis of Fiffe or Angus, Quhilkis ar now my
la^dis and inhabit with my pepill. Forthir I were rycht vnmercy full, gyf I wald
nocht gyf peace to Pichtis on the samyn manner as the Pichtis gaif peace before
to Scottis quhen they were brokin with weris. Bot now ye mat is at ane vter
point. For ye Pichtis ar sworn be solemn atthis neuir to gif peace to ws. And
the Scottis on ye same manner sworn neuir to gif nor it to tak peace with
Pichtis, quhill ye crown of Pichtis be geuin to me ye Just heritour yairof. Gif
thou desiris peace? exoner ye of the crown of Pichtis. And deliver in my handis
al ye strenthis yairof, that I be general consent of al ye pichtis may be
declarit king. Gif their desyris semis importable to Pichtis Force is to thaym
to perseueir in battall aganis ws, quhilkis ar preparit in may wei^ly
ordinance to inuaid yame. Traisting be esperance of our Just persute to have
victory. The two kyngis seuering in this manner but any expedition of yair
desyris, returnit to yair tentis. Inco^tinet raise ane hidous clamor and reird
in both the armyis desyring ye rycht to be de^^^it be the swerd with (...)
chance as fortoun list gif. Kenneth exhortit his folkis to assail feirslie
their ennymes and to perseueir in fervent battal, y^ (...) may be discussit be
ye day, quhiddir the scottis ^all abandoun ye pichtis. Or the pichtis ye
scottis. Ye reward of victory was ye realm of pychtis ^petual honor and

To ye rycht wi^g was maid ane nobil capitane namit Bar. To ye left wyng

al dangeir. Inco^tine^t be thondera^d preis of trumpat both the armyis ^unit.
Than raise ane huge reird and clamor, and maid money of ye pichtis so affrayit,
yt they apperit (before yai assaileit ye chance of battall) to f^e. Nochtheles
Donskene exhortit yame to assail their ennymes with great spreit, and su^tyme
reprochit yame of yair febilnes. And sumtyme rasit yair spretis to n^w curage,
promitting great riches and la^dis in reward of yair lauboures. followit sone
ane terrible bergane. Ye weme^ seeing yair husbandis wo^dit gaif sic horrible
spraichis, that yai were more impediment yan support to ye ^echtaris. Be yan was
ye richt wyng of pichtis (quhare gretest multitud of women faucht) de^eckit and
put to flycht. Than Kenneth send ane buscheme^t of fresche men on ye bakkis of
yame that were fecht and in ye myddilward. Yus were ye pichtes sloppit with huge
slaucht. And because yai had na hope of victory nor it power to resist, yai
sla^g yair wappi^nis fra yam, and tuk ye flycht. Sa huge pepil were slane in ye
place quhare they first Iunit, and sa huge noumer of armor and wappinnis that
ye scottis in yair chase were co^stranit to pas ouir innoumerable carionis and
wappinnis of deid pepil. Throw quhilk sindry scotts were brokin fra array of
their fallowis and dreuin amang great buschementis of pichtis quhair yai were
cruelly slane. Kenneth knawing this damage be sound of tru^pat callit his
folkis to ye standart. And eftir yt he had arrayit sindry buscheme^tis of may
gana^d men for ye chase, he gaif to yame capitanis, co^mandit yame to follow on
their ennimes with good armor and to saif nane y^ micht be apprehe^dit. Yan
Kenneth passit ye residew of yat day and nycht following w^ ane cu^pany of
chosin men. The capitanis glaidly obeyit ye empire of Ke^neth, and slew be lang
chase all ye pichtis yt they micht ouirtak. King Donskene with ane cu^pany of
pichtis fled to ye watter of Tay and abaid yair sa lang on ane bait yt he was
slane with all hes cu^pany. It is said y^ pichtis renewit battall ye day.vii.
times aganis the scottis, and war ay discomfist.

How the svverd and cote armor of king Donskene war send to Colmekyl. Of the
orison maid be king Kenneth to his noblis. How the pichtis war slane and
banist out of scotland. and how ye Du^barris tuk their beginning. Ca. xi.
After this victory ye scotts partit ye spule of yis battal be rite of armis,
and se^d ye swerd and cote armor of king Donskene to sanct Colme to remane in
Colmekyll in perpetual sign of their victory. On ye morrow al ye noblis of
scottis come to Kenneth reiosand of this victory, and desyrit him to tak rest
eft sa great labor. and suffer hes army to return hame. Bot Kenneth thocht not
proffitabil to ceis quhil he had put ane end to hes weres. Incontinent he
callit al his noblis before him and said in yis manner. It is ye deuore of ane
forcy ca^pion (gif he intendis to use victory to ye weil of his army) to ^eis
not fra battal quhil he have ma^d amite with his vicust ennymes, or ellis
brocht yam to sic ruin y^ yai micht neuir recover. for gif any man wald suffer
his ennyme (quh^ he is brokin and neir vincust) to rest quhil he may recouir
his strenth, Be my Judgment he should do ane thing richt da^m^gius to him self.
as to ye da^geir presently appering, ye pichtis a^ now brokin with our weris,
and brocht to sic state, y^ yai may be distroyit be (...), and it it war ane
thing (...) abominable to invade thaym with sic cruelte gif we micht any manner
of way bring yam to sicker amite and freindschip, considering yai ar now
enragit aganis ws for displesouris to yame done. Nochtheles yir pichtis as e
know ar subtel and desiris na thing mair than vengeance on ws and our
posterite. And for ye cause yai sall neuir deuoid yair hartis (sa lang as yai
leave) of yir importable cruelteis done be ws. Yus may na amite nor freindschip
be drawin i^ times cu^ing betwix ws and pichtis. for sic cruelteis ar now
exercit on every side, ye yai cannot be redressit. Gif e have sicht yair fore
to our singular weill, na thing is sa good as to seif nothir man, wif, nor
barn of Pichtis blude on live, in adventure yat sic posterite rise of thaym
sone after that sall both revenge their faderis slauthter and bring our
realm in greit dangeir. Yis opinion of ye king (yocht it was cruel) was found
for sindry reasonis richt proffitable to ye weil of scott^s. Incontinent sic
cruelte and bludy rage was maid on pichtis in all partis, ye nane of yame was
left on live out of Camelon and other strenthis, except ii.M. personis quhilk
fled to ye Inglismen. Yan Kenneth partit ye landis of pichtis ama^g his noblis
be sycht of yair meritis and prowes. and namit al ye landis* montanis, and
riuaris of yis region with new names. Ilk land tuk ye name after ye possessour
for ye time. to ye fine yt the auld names of yir la^dis should peris with memory
of pichtis. Bar an noble man gat for his singular vassalage prouyn in this last
field ane strange castle in Lowthiane namit Du^bar. Fra this name raise ye house
and surname of Du^baris, quhilkis ar of great renoun and honor to yir dayis. Of
this house come ye erl^s of March continewyng with lang progression of their
sonnis and ^enois heritouris of the said house. (...) ar of this house money
nobill clerkis and doctouris clothit for their notabil virtew with prelacijs
and honouris to their dayis. Sic thingis done, Kenneth went with money army^ me^
to sege ye town of Camelon. For sindry pichtis fled to it with yair ^^ffis and
children, traisting (because the town was strenthe) to haif ane sickir refuge in
it. First ane herald past to Camelon to assail, gif the pychtis wald randir
the town. And because they refusit, ane strait sege was laid thairto, quhilk
money monethis eftir co^tinewit. Ye scotts war sa irkit with the sege, that
they serchit money ingynis to win the town. And finalie yai brocht ane great
multitude of treis to (...) the ^renchis and fowsyis yairof. In the mean time
the cie^ezanis began to laik vittallis, and send their oratouris to Kenneth
desyryng three ^ayis trewis. That they mycht tak ^^^sement amang thaym self
concerning ye randeryng of ye town. Kenneth hauand na suspicion of dissait,
consentit to yair desiris. And co^man^i^ his army to ceis fra segyng of ye
^own, during the three dayis e^tir followyng. In the mean time ane certane of
pychtis Ischi^ at ye third vigill out at ane auld port, quhilk was not oppinnit
money eris afor^, and first slew ye wache of Scottis, syne come with great affray
to the kyngis tentis, and maid Ithand slauchter, sa lang as ye nycht endurit,
and fled incontinent to ye town. Nochtheles the Scottis followit on thaym with
sic slauchter, that they had won the town, were nocht they were stoppit be ganeis
arowis and stanis sch^t out of ye touris of Camelon. In yis (...) mussing were
slane ma yan.vi.^. scottis. Nochtheles Kenneth maid ane new wache in the some
ordour as before. And because ye pichtis had violat their faith to him, he maid
ane solemn aith neuir to sever fra this town, quhill the wallis thairof were
equate to ye ground. And youcht he assaileit to tak this town be sindry
ingynis, it na thing yairof come til effect. For the pychtis sa vaileantly
resistit, that the sege continewit still four monethis but any interruption.
Throw quhilk sic miserable hunger raise amang the cietezanis thairof, that they
abhorrit not to eit may vile and abominable metes. And yocht they were in
sic^ xtreme rage of hunger, it they slew all yame that gaif counsall to rander
the town. At last this town being ouirset and weary be Ithand persute of
Scotts, yair fowsyis fillit with wod and other sindry stuf to the wallis,
Kenneth send.vi.C. men to ye nixt wod to make ledderes. Their me^ returnit with
ye same on ye morrow and went with vnfrayit curage to ye wallis. And finalie
entrit at sindry partis thairof with sindry abuscheme^tis. The cietezanis
astonist with yis suddane irruptioun of scottis, and nocht of power to resist,
left ye wallis. and faucht (sa la^g as ya^ ^icht) with perseuerant hatren^ to
ye deith. And finalie were all slane but any mercy or ransoun. The nobillis
commandit to cast down ye town and to leif na pychtis on live within the sa
mine. The preistis, matronis, virginis and childrin come before Kenneth with
pietuous cheir desiring grace. Bot ye fury of Scottis was sa great that they but
any miseration were al slane. Eftir yis ye wallis, housis, castellis and kirkes
were brint, and brocht to ye ground. Of all this town sum time sa honest,
remanit nocht haistely bot the powder w^ll and calsay, of quhilkes sum thing
r^manis it in their dayis. The samyn time the madyn castle of Edinburgh was
garnist with stra^g soudiouris and pichtis. Nochtheles the pychtis within the
same dredand si^lik subuersioun of thaym, as was laitlie in Camelon, left the
castle desert, and fled in Northu^birland. Yus faileit the realm of pychtis
in Albioun, and all their pepill brocht to nocht. Eftir that they had roungin
in the samyn.i.M.i.C.li. eris. The eir of thayr exterminioun out of Albioun was
fra the incarnation.viii.C.xxxix. eris. Fra the first cumyng of scottis in
Albion.i.M.iiii.C.xxi. eris. Fra the beginning of ye world vi.M.xxxviii. eris.

Of uncouth meruellis seen in Albion. How the chiar of marbyll was brocht out
of Argyle to Scone. Of the lavvis maid be Kenneth for the common vveill of
Scottis, and of his deith. Ca. xii.
IN the samyn eir apperit two Cometis rycht horribill to the sycht of man. That
ane apperit before the son risyng in heruest. This other schane ay eftir ye
son gang in to in Ueir. Oftymes was seen in the nycht two battellis of armyt
men fechtand togidder with birnand speris in the air. And als sone as ane of
yame was vincust, the tothir sone euanist. Quhen the bischop of Camelon was
doand divine service in his pontifical, his staf tuk neid fire, and mycht nocht
be slokynnit quhil it was resoluit to nocht. On fair day lycht beside Camelon
sic noyis and reird of armyt men was hard, that the pepill were astonist and
durst not remane thairabout. Their meruellis were interpret sum time to the good.
and sum time to the evil of the pepil, as ye deuinouris plesit. Quhen Ke^neth
had distroyit the pichtis and conquest their realm in yis manner, he brocht the
fatal chiar of merbill out of Argyle to Gowry, quhilk chiar (as said is before)
was brocht out of Spane in Ireland be Simon Brek. And out of Ireland be Fergus
the first king in Argyle, quhare it remanit ay quhill their dayis. And because
this last victory of Pychtis happinnit nocht far fra Scone, he ordanit ye said
chiar to remane perpetually in the said abbay. And all scottis kyngis to
resaue their diadem in the samyn. Ye pychtis banist out of Scotland in this
manner, and seeing ye Inglismen mycht na wayis be persuadit for the civil weris
amang thaym to inuaid the Scottis, went in Denmark. Otheris serching gyf they
mycht any way get support to recover their realm, fled in Norroway. Otheris
remanit in Ingland seikand their leuyng be cheualrye or fruit of their handis.
Kenneth kepit his subditis eftir the exterminioun of pychtis in sicker peace
during his life, as ane nobill prince worthy to have indifficient glore. And
was geuin na les to polyce and ciuyl maneris, yan to cheualrie. He drew all ye
confusit lawis of Scotland in ane co^pendius volumen, and abrogat al thaym that
were unprofitable, and maid new lawis mair expedient. Of quhilkis sindry
remanis ^it as followis.

siclike wordis to their prince, and seand na emendation of his ly^e bot his
hatrent daily rising aganes (...), they left their purpos. Thus was the pepyll
be vicius leuyng of their prince degenerat in every vice* all reason turnit in
dissait, and Justice rang for iniquite. In yis mean time ye residew of Pichtis
(quhilkis fled ^mang Inglismen) he^rand the insolence of Scottis tuk desire to
reco^^r their realm in Albion. And solistit Osbret and Ella two great princes
of Ingland to move weir aganis ye scottis, and promitti^ ^o obey to thaym and
their posterite, gif the said princes wald restore thaym to their landis in
Albion. Osbret and Ella men of hie ingyne and prudence, and knawing be quhat
detestabyll vicis the Scottis war effeminat, refusit nocht their desyris of
Pychtis. And it yai wald not schaw yame ennymes to Scottis, quhill all
contentionis war pecifyit amang their nobillis. And quhen ye samyn war dressit
may prudently, their foresaid capitanis Osbret and Ella come with ane army of
Inglysmen and Britonis. And after that they had set down their tentis in Mers
and Berwyk, they send ane herald to king Donald, chargeand him to restore the
landis laitly taken fra Pychtis, other wayis Inglismen and Britonis should be na
les ennymes to him than Pychtis was before. Donald astonist be this message, and
knawyng nocht quhat was to be done, began to search quhare he mycht best hyde
him, to eschew the fury of ennymes. it fynaly be hortatioun of his nobillis
(that he should nocht be his cowarty expone the realm to extreme dangeir) He
commandit all pepyll under his dominioun to conuene certane day and place with
all ordinance necessare to resist their ennymes. King Donald accumpanyit with
his nobyllis and commonis in this sort, gaif Osbret and Ella battall at
Iedburgh. In this battall the Danis war dyscomfist with great slauchter, and
chasit to the montanis. Donald rycht insolent after this victory, and believing
him self formelye d^lyueryt of all truble, come to the mouth of Tweid with his
victorius army, and fand their two schippis ladin with winis vittallis and all
other thingis necessar to sustene the army of Inglisme^. King Donald tuk finaly
yir schippis with small labor, and partit the spule and riches yairof amang his
weirmen. The spule of yir schippis was mair noysum to the scottis, tha^ war
yair ennimes. For Donald was geuyn to sic voracite and lust of his wambe, that
he corruppit all his army in detestable maneris. The ou^g men following the
maneris of king Donald, fillit the army full of bordellis, tauernis, and huris.
Followit dising and carting* and of yame come contention and slauchter. Thus
war ye army maid ane gadering of licherus pepyl but any ordour of cheualry.
Osbret heirand y^ Scottis geuyn to sic immoderat plesour and lustis, come on
yame with ane new army, quhen they beleuit na thing les tha^ his cumyng. and
slew thaym nakit of armor full of wine and sleip in their beddis. The skry
suddanly vprais throw terrible ^u^myssing of deand pepil, and awalkynnit the
army with miserabyl affray. Followit sone ane lamentabyl murdir of Scottis. Sum
contending (bot in vane) to euaid yair ennymes. Otheris slane but bebait.
Otheris fled quhare they micht best. In this unhappy bergane war slane.xx.M.
scottis. King Donald was taken full of wine and sleip, and led throw the cuntre
to be ane derision to al pepil. And with him was taken all ye remane^t noblis y^
war left vnslane, and put in prison, yair tentis spuleit and maid pray to
Inglismen and britonis. Ye fame of this unhappy battall maid ye remanent
scottis na les dolorus tha^ yair realm had fallin i^ pray to their ennymes. Sum
began to wary fortoun. Otheris traistit al their mischeuis fallin only be
vengeance of yair unhappy king and his cursit counsal. Otheris ran throw
streets inquiryng yame yt they met quha was taken or slane, and quhat the
Inglismen intendit to do eft yis victory. At last heirand ye Inglismen war
cumyn i^ Lowthiane, and ye britonis i^ Galloway ceissing fra na manner of
cruelte y^ micht be deuisit, yai war mair affrayit tha^ euir was any pepyl
before. Ye spraichis and lamentabyl cryis of weme^ heirand ye miserabyll
slau^hter of their freindis and husbandis af^^ayit all the cuntre. The a^mering
was sa huge, yt few apperit other to revenge ye iniures of ennymes, or it to
defend yair realm. Throw quhilk al ye boundis of scotland fra Humbir to
Striuelyng was ouir riddin, and nothir man, wife, nor page left on live y^
mycht be ouirtakyn be Inglismen or Britonis. And belyue they maid yame reddy to

far as they micht) amang ye pepyl. And with all sensabyl men yt yai culd gaddir,
Yai stoppit certane dayis the cumyng of ennymes ouir Forth. Osbret incontinent
stuffit certane schippis with x.M. chosin men to cum ouir Forth. In ye mean
time raise sa vehement storm, y^.v.M. of thaym perist and the residew but mast

nocht be tur^it be see, come to the brig of Striueling to conuoy his army land

and said it ^tenit not to vailea^t ca^pionis having victory but debai^ to
inuaid vincust pepill with new iniuris, yair king captive, and yai^ noblis
beand sa miserably slane, and remembering yame y^ scottis war vincust mair be

succeid to him howbeit he vincust febil pepil quhilk was set to tak peace under
quhat condition he plesit. Nochttheles gif he wald na wayis condescend to
peace, ya^ should prefer honest deith to schamefull life. Osbret degeistly auisit
on their petitionis was content to have peace with scottis under yir
conditionis, yt al landis conquest fra scottis at this time sall remane under
perpetual dominion of Inglismen and britonis. and na forthir conques to be maid

Of the orison maid be Calenus* how scottis tuk peace with Inglismen and
Britonis. how king Donald was put in prison for his vicis, and slew him
self. Of syndry meruellis seen in Albioun. Ca. xiiii.
Money of the Scottis thocht the peace sorrowful under yir co^ditionis. Otheres
thocht the realm in sic dangeir y^ peace was necessare i^ quhat sumeuir sort
it micht be had. Thus they had been deuidit in syndry factionis, war nocht ane
agit man namit Calenus thane of Angus (quhylk had.vii. sonnis slane with king
Donald at this last battall) pecifyit yame in this manner. I find in the
croniklis, how ye vaileant* Galdus our souerane (for quhais singular
preeminence in glore of arms the landis of Brigance war callit Galloway)
brocht the Romany (quhilkes war ^antouris of all pepyll) to sic extreme
calamite, that they socht his peace under quhat co^ditionis he plesit, that
they mycht eschew the irrecouerabyll dangeir tha^ appering to yair army. And
youcht he had slane yame but any mercy or ra^soun, he had d^ne bot small outrage
or dishonor to ye residew of roman pepyll. Heirfore gif ye Roman army dep^st
with evil fortoun and haua^d ma nobil men of singular prudence and counsal tha^
ar now amang ws) submittit thaym to have peace at ye will of their ^nnymes,
because they micht na other wayis aschew the da^geir ^^curring. I think
thairfore we should not eschame sen we are vincust, our realm standing in extreme
dangeir, our king and noblis taken to have peace with ennimes in quhat sumeuir
sort it may be had. And it micht our common weil (quhilk hes been sa vailea^tly
debaittit to our days) have defense any other way. I think we should erar ieopard
ws to extreme dangeir of battall, than to seik sa sorrowful condition of
peace. Forthir micht our lyuis wylfully offerit to the deid deliver our realm
and pepyl, fra ye schame and trubyll now appering. I should be ye first yt should
wylfully offer him self in sacrifice in y^ behalf. Bot sen we are cumyn to sic
calamite and affliction, y^ force is to have peace under quhat sumeuir
co^ditionis it may be had for this time, or ellis to tine our realm fechtand
fulichely with ennymes to ye deith. Best is yairfore to have peace, and to saif
our realm (quhilk hes been with syndry chancis of fortoun sa vaileantly
defendit) to espera^ce of greter prosperity, y^ e may su^tyme reco^er the
landis reft fra ow be iniure of ennymes. And gif e other wayis do e sall tyne
our self, our wiffis, childrin, and realm but any recover. The noblis for this
cou^sal send ambassatoures to have peace with britonis and Inglismen in ye
manner before rehersit. The peace beand ratifyit. Donald was send i^ scotland
ra^sonit with great sowmes of money. Than ye Britonis and Inglismen sat down
^eacia billy i^ sindry braid bou^dis of scotland. The Britonis gat al ye landis
fra Striuelyng to the Ireland seis, and fra the watter of Forth and Clide to
Cu^bir with all strenthis thairof. The Inglismen gat all the landis betuix*
Striueling and Northumberland. Thus was Clyde march betuix scottis and
britonis on that ane side, and the watter of Forth namit ye scottis se^ march
betuix yame and Inglysmen on ye tothir side. And Striuelyng common march to
three pepyl* scottis, Britonis and Inglismen. The castle was in keeping of king
Osbret, quhilk reparit it with new munitionis. Nochtwithstanding ye rewyne
thairof maid before be scottis, quhen they spul^eit ye pichtis of yair realm.
Yis osbret had his cuneouris within this castle (be quhom ye striueling money

Forth. In ye middis yairof stude ane image of ye crucifix, and vnd ye samyn was

To scottis, to britoni^, and to Inglismen.
THe Pychtis seand their three pepyll brocht to concord dred be suspicion yat

slane be Inglismen. This was the end of Pichtis quhilkis fled in Ingland after
ye expulsion of yame fra yair realm. In ye same time king Donald quhylk was
brocht hame yocht he was unworthy with great triumph remouit all virtuous and
nobil men out of his cumpany, and fell to all vicis as before. And youcht

Of king Constantine the secound* and of his lavvis. Of the heavy regrait maid

DOnald the tyran^ slane (as we have wrytyn) Constantine the secound of that

all thyngis brocht to the same estait as they wa^ before in the time of Kenneth.
King Constantyne to dres their materis conuenit his nobillis to ane counsall at
S^one, quhar^ he be publik auctorite maid their lawis under writin. In the first
he co^mandit kirkme^ to wait diligently on divine service, they sall abstene
fra all profane labouris, and leave con^ent of the patrimony pertenand to their
kirkis. Yai sall preche the word of god to ye pepyll. They sall leave on ye

And gif their kirkmen fail and do nocht their deuore as cris^^^ pepill thinkis
reasonable, they sal pay for the first falt great sowmes of money, and for the
secound falt (gif yai amend nocht their life) yai salbe degradit of their

It was co^mandit be ye same decreit all tauerneris, drunkattis, Bordallaris,
and prouocaris of the pepil to intemperat diet or lusts sall pas out of the

to suffir laubouris. and of effeminat creatouris maid wise and manly campionis.
Followit sone eftir great felicite to the realm throw wise and prudent
administratioun of king Constantyne. the first trubill that raise in his time
was be Euanus capitane of ye Ilis. For our pepill hes been ay of sa peruerst
and insolent ingyne sen their first beginning, that they may nothir sustene
lang peace nor weir. Quhen they ar waistit be lang weris, they think na thing
sa displesand to thaym as battall. And laubouris than to have peace with vter
deligence, eftir lang peace they flow in riches, and incressis Ilk day sa
insole^t yt they may nocht suffir equale administration of Justice. And than
seikis be frequent occasion other to have weir with ennymes, or else to have
weir ama^g yame self. On the same manner Euanus of the Ilis irki^ of lang peace
gaderit ane c^pany of siclik li^maris as him self in the castle of Dunstafage
(for it was in his keeping) and be lang orisoun co^plenyt before thaym that
continuatioun of lang peace with uncouth pepill hes brocht the nobillis to
servitude. Constantyne yair king was ane dum, severe, and unmercifully prince,
more proffitable to co^monis yan to noblis. and hes maid certane lawis to be
execute equale on pure and rich but any reverence of estait. And hes richit
his familiaris be vane color of Justice, putting his nobillis to great
punition. Thus was na place left to gentill men and nobillis to sustene their
life with sic honor as yair eldaris did before. Be contrar men of vile and
obscure lynnage ar daily promouit to riches and honouris. Na man micht leif
for his strait lawis, bot gif yai pas their time with innocence as churlis
dois, quhilk na gentill heart mycht suffir. Heirfore that nobil men sal nocht be
haldin under sic perpetual seruitud* and that churlis sall nocht in times
cuming have occasioun to be insole^t and proud, Best is to conspire aganis
Constantyne. And other to tak him or ellis inuaid him with all ye power they
mycht, quhilk beand done, all thingis micht succeid as they plesit. The Ilis
men rycht desirus to have their reneis fre (that they mycht iniure the pepill
as before but any punitioun) assistit to his opinioun. And solistit all ye
pepill of Murray, Ros and Cathnes to rebel aganis their prince. Nochtheles the
treason was sone discouerit to the king. And causit him with ane cumpany of
chosin men to cum haistely to Dunstafage, quhare yis Euanus hapnit to be for
the ^yme. And tuke him with sindry his complicis and hingit thaym on Iebaitis.
And because sindry great princis of ye cuntre were participant of his treasoun.
They were all taken on the samyn manner, and put in strange presonnis, quhil ye
king mycht have degeist consultation quhat punition was efferyng to their
offense.

How Gadanus king of Danis send his two brethir Hungar and Hubba with great
armyis to inuaid the Scottis* and how the said Hubba was vincust* and his
army put to flicht. Ca. xvi.
ALs sone as yis trubil was peacifyit on yis wise, followit ane other of gretar
motioun. For the stair of man hes neuir experience of more aduersite, yan quhen
ye samyn leist apperis. Gadanus king of Denmark come with ane army first aganis
scottis, and syne aganis Inglismen. The motive of his weris was because ye
residew of p^chtis, quhilk ^^ed in Denmark (quhen they were doung out of Albion
be ye weris of scottis) resignit to him al richt y^ yat micht have to yair
realm i^ Albion. And for ye cause he send his.ii. brethir Hu^gar and Hubba with
ane flote of dani^ in Albion. And finalie arriuit in (...) or euir the brute of
their weris come to the eris of scottis. And eftir their arriuyng, they inuadit
the pepill with sic cruelteis, that they were cons^^anit for saifte of their
lyuis to seik new habitatioun. In the mean time was in they regionis ane huge
noumer of haly men, quhilk prechi^ daily the scripture and euang^llis to the
pepill. Bot they were inuadit with sic slauchter and cruelte be the Danis yt the
may part of yame fled with Adriane bischop of scotland to the I Will of May, to
eschew ye dangeir appering. This May is ane I Will betuix Fiffe and Lowthiane, and
i^ it was ane abbay of monkis. Bot nothir ye reverence of yis religious place,
nor it ye innocence of their haly men micht saif thaym, for they war al slane
with uncouth punition and torment. Their haly martyris sanct Adriane and his
fallowis ar haldin it in great venecation be Inglismen and Scottis, and daily
myraclis kithi^ be yame^ king Constantine seand y^ furius cruelte of Danis ylk
day mair incre^^ing, thocht mair expedient to assail the chance of fortoun
quhil his pissance was haill, Than quhen it was attenuat be frequent
displesouris. and yairfore co^mandit all his pepyll to mete him in their best
manner agane ane certane day and place. The day byrt^n he come with ane army
aganis the Danis and fand yame ^ampit in Fiffe, and liand two mylis syndry
deuidit be ye watter of Leuyn. This watter was boldin at their cumyng be sic
violent schouris, yat it mycht not be riddyn. And after the inundatioun
thairof, followit sa meruellus serenite, that it gai^ occasion to Constantyne
to inuaid the Danis with battall. And because nane of their two armyis of Danis
micht support other, Constantyne come with arrayit battall aganis Hubba, quhilk
was capitane of danis on ye southe side of Leuyn, Ye danis had sa fervent
desire to fecht, yt they micht na wayis be haldin within yair tentis. Hubba
maid hortation to superseid yai^ fury quhil they micht have rescours of
freindis. Nochyeles yai war sa fers. yt they come to array without advise of
Hubba their capitane, and had above their harnes cote armouris bordourit with
reid sylke, schinand with meruellus brichtnes, and stok swerdis quhom na armor
micht resist. Yir danis apperit richt terrible be yair huge bodyis*
nochtwithstanding both ye armyis iunit and faucht with incredible fury. At
last y^ danis ouirset with multitude of pepil war sa inuadit on ilk side yt yai
micht not resist, and slang haistely yair wappinnis fra yame, and fled. Money of
yame flea^d to yair tentis war slane. Otheris war cas^in in fowseis and with
their deid carionis maid ane gait to the scottis to cum to yair tentis. Su^ of
thaym perist in the river. Otheris be craft of swomyng were sauit. Hubba swame
throw ye river but any perel. Than was Humber rycht reiosit yat his brodir
hubba had eschapit both the dangeir of ennymes and y^ river. And inco^tine^t
he armit him with great Ire to revenge y^ slaucht of his folks.

How king Constantine was slane and his army discomfist be the Danis. Ca.
xvii.
THe scottis were sa insolent eftir this victory, yat yai tuke lityll
solicitude or thocht to the residew of their battall that was to be led aganis
the Danis. Bot as na aduersite mycht follow, and as every thing were dantit be
their only virtew, yai had their ennymes in contemption. And spendit two dayis
in dansyng, reuellyng and singing but any sycht to cheualrye. Sa far procedit
their folly yt they kest cauillis, quhay should have ye may rich presoneris
ama^g the Danis, na otherwayis than victory had been present in yair hands.
And above this insolence the oung and agit nobillis fell in contentioun with
may outragius wourdis aganis other. The agit men desiryng to be preferrit be
reason of yair lang experience and age. The oung men be reason of their manheid
and outh reddy to assail all perellis. Bot thayr was na sermon amang thaym
how yair army should be arrayit. Nor it be quhat wayis their ennymes should be
vincust. At last quhen the watter of Leuyn was fallin, king Co^stantyne brocht
ouir his army to fecht with ye residew of Danis. Ye Danis haua^d more sycht to
ye governance of their battal, yan to any spule arrayit yair army in this sort.
In ye rycht wyng was Hubba with.vi.M. danis. In the left wyng was Buernus
Inglisman, quhilk was banist out of Ingland for pollution of Osbret ye king of
Inglandes wife, and he come to this battal aganis scottis with y^ residew of
pichtis quhilkis war banist before out of Albion. In the myddylward was Hu^gar
with ye remanent danis exhorting yam to pas to battal with good curage, and
schew how the I Will of Albion with ye riches and frut yairof should be reward of
their victory. Be contrar gif yai war vincust, nocht micht follow bot deid and
slauchter of yame all with perpetual schame. And to inflam yame with mair fury,
he swore neuir to return to his tents without he had victory, and causit yame
to be al sworn in ye samyn wise. On the tothir side king Constantine put Ethus
his brothir in ye richt wi^g, and Du^cane thane of Athole in ye left wing
with.x.M. me^ in ilkane of their battallis, and arrayit him self in ye
middilward with ye residew of scottis. Sine began to make his orisoun to his
army, and first he gaif tha^kis to god for yis victory recently fallin to his
pepil, and exhortit yame, to fyle not with schamfull fleing ye glore yt yai
conquest before be yair ma^heid and virtew, and prayit yame to have na feir of
yair ennymes* for yai were bot corpolent bodyis but any virtew, and micht
thairfore be sone vincust. Gif they war inuadit on ye samyn manner as they war
before, and finaly requirit yame to ryn not ouir feirsly i^ battal, bot erar to
suffir yair ennymes to cu^ on yame. For he beleuit the said ennymes be rage of
Ire to ryn sa fast forthwart yat yai should be weary and brokin or eui^ yai come
to straikis, Bot this command of Constantyne was rycht noysum till our ^olkis.
For the bald sp^eit and feirsnes that should have been ekit be hortatioun of yair
capitane, was gre^^mlie menist be yis command of Constantyne. Our folkis vsis
(quhen they ar to fecht) to cum with sic faird and noys that they raise na les
thaim self with hie ^urage, than astonisis their ennymes with dredour. Ye danys
be s^u^d o^ trumpat went forthwart. Nochttheles yai were so expert in cheualrie
fra they saw their ennymes nocht mei^ thaym that they sum time abaid. And sum
time went forthwart with esy pais schowtand their ganeis and dartis. On the
tothir side the scottis schot at yir danis arowis and sloung stanys. Belyue
both the armyis Iunyt, and faucht with incredibill fury, quhyll at last the
scottis were put to flycht. On quhom foll^wit the Danis with lang slaucht and
chase. In this unhappy battall were slane.x.M. scottis, amang mon^ other
presoneris, king Constantyne was taken and brocht to ane coue beside the sea,
quhare he was heidit the.xiii. eir of his regne. Fra the

Of king Ethus and his actis, how Osbret king of Ingland with money other
pepyl was slane be cruelte of Danis* of sindry meruellis seen in Albion* and
of the deith of Ethus. Ca. xviii.
BE yis unhappy battal sic miserabil skaith followit to scottis, yt had not
been Ethus brothir to king Constantine happinnit to be saiffit be hes fleyng,
ye name and memory of scottis had been endit yis day i^ Albion. Ye residew of
scottis (quhilkis eschapit fra this unhappy battall) co^uenit at Scone, and
maid Ethus king. Money uncouth and strange meruellis war seen at yis time in
Albion. Ane multitude of fische was seen in Forth, the taken half of yame above
ye watter na thing different fra y^ figour of man callit be ye pepil
Bassinatis. Their fische hes blak skynnis hingand on their bodyis, with quhilk
sumtyme ya^ couir yair heid and yair cragis even to yair schulderis. Quhen their
fische fletis in our seyis, yai signify great infortuniteis to mortal pepyll.
Ye lochis and riuaris stude frosin fra ye beginning of November to ye end of

nowmer of padokis, yt the air was infeckit to ye great damage of pepyll. Ane
comite was seen with fyrie bemis risyng before none, and schane all the month
of Aprile. The pepyll astonist with sic uncouth meruellis beleuit great
affliction to cum on yame. The Danis after yis victory come in Louthiane, and
chasit the inhabitantis thairof in Northu^b^rla^d, and fauch^ yair aganis
Osbret king of Ingland be support of bruernus quhilk was banist (as we schew
before, and fynaly yai slew ye said Osbret be plane battall and put all his

Ye remanent ki^gis of Ingland faucht certane eris eft be syndry chance of

quhilk succedit eft king Eldrede to ye realm of northfolk and southfolk. Yis
Eldrede vincust ye danis be frequent battal* and slew both Hungar and Hubba,
and restorit Ingland to ye auld liberte. Bot we will return to ye remanent
geistis of king Ethus. It is said this prince was sa swift, yt he mycht tak ane
heart or ane hou^d be force of speid. Nochtheles quhat su^euir gifts of nature
followit him, he apperit richt vnabil to govern ye realm. For quhen he micht
have recouerit with sober besynes Fif and Louthiane with other la^dis taken fra
scottis be iniure of Inglismen and britonis. He tuk na regard thairof hauand
mair sicht to his lust, tha^ any common weil of ye realm, as ye samyn should not
have been reformit to ane better chance. He seruit hes vnbridillit lust but any
respect to civil or religius maneris, and yocht he was rycht agil and deliver
of body with money other giftis of god and nature, he abusit yame sa, yt na

Of king Gregoure and his lavvis. how he recouerit sindry landis of his realm
and disco^fist Herdeut with al ye army of danis* how Rasyne great capitane of
danis was slane be Inglismen. Ca. xix.
EThus beand yus miserably deceissit i^ prison, Gregoure son to Co^gallus
(yat tang before king Alpine) was crownit at Scone. He had bot two monethis in
age, quhen his fader perist at Spay. Yis Gregoure after his coronation knawing
weill that divine help is the only targe and sicker munition of kings and
realms, but quhilk na kingdoms may stand any time permanent. Thairfore yat he
mycht begin his empire with mair felicite, he set ane conuention of his nobillis
at Forfair for agmentation of divine service. And that kirkmen mycht the mair
freely geif their attendance to ordoure thaym in good religion, he statuit be
publik parliament that kirkmen salbe perpetually exonorat of all weris,
tributis, and publik exactionis, that are to be put on the pepyl be him or his
successouris in times cumyng. And they sall not be drawin before profane iugis*
bot allanerly to be submittit to their ordinat Iugis. He gaif power to all
bischoppis of his realm to decide before yame al actio^is pertena^d to faith of
body, with power both to cause ye pepyl keip yair faith promittit to yair
nichtbour, and to punis yarne for violation yairof. He gaif als power to ye
said kirkmen to make lawis and constitutionis for the weill of cristin faith.
And to discus al debaitis concerning oblationis or teindis, testamentis,
obligatio^is or legasi^s, to i^terprete ye lawis, and to punis manesworn pepyl
blasphlemaris of god or his sanctis. To curs al pepyl rebella^d to yair
co^stitutionis, and to inhibit yame to cum quhare deuyne service was done, and
yt al personis (quhilkis war cursi^ be yame) should brouk na heritage, nor be
hard i^ Judgment. Bot exilit good cu^pany, and na faith to be geuyn to his
deposition and witness. He co^mandit yt al^ princes succeding after him sall make
their aith after yair coronation to defend ye honor and liberte of haly kirk
and kirkmen. And sall make na derogation to the constitutionis of the kirk. This
Gregoure had ane natural inclination to the service o^ god with sa grave and
sententious la^gage, yat al his wordis and dedis apperit as they had been pasit
in just balance. He was sa institute in his outh yat he leuit al his days ane
heuynly life of skars fude and sleip, but any lust or conversation of women,
and had in gyne na les geuyn to polecy and administration of Justice than to
cheualry. Ye first iornay yat he maid was in fiffe to recouir i^ fra tyranny of
Danis and Pichtis. At quhais cumyng the Pichtis (quhilkis war left be Danis to
i^habit ye said land) war sa astonist, knawing the huge hatrent ye scottis b^re
aganis yame y^ yai fled in Louthiane. Gregoure fyndand Fiff^ desert in this
manner, brocht scottis out of syndry partis of his realm to inhabit ye samyn.
After yis he come in Louthiane, and brocht it in ye samyn manner to his
dominion. Sine went to ye mers, quhare syndry cu^panyis of pichtis and Danis
war assemblit to geif him battal. Nochthelis ye danis s^and sa great multitude
of scottis i^ their sycht, fled to Berwik quhare syndry other Danis were of yai^

cumin to yair support. Ye Inglisme^ (quhilkis war yat time in B^rwyk) hauand na
thing in mair hatrent than the empire of Danis, randeri^ the town of Berwik to
scottis. Gregoure resauit ye town and gaif license to Inglismen to depart or
remane at their pleseir, and slew all Danis (quhom he fand in it) but any mercy
or ransoun. And quhen he had garnist this town with all necessaris for keeping
thairof, he come with his army in Northumberland to e^k ye samyn to the empire
of scottis. In the mean time war two armyis liand in Northumbirland, ye taken of
Danis not far fra ork. Yi^ other of Inglismen not.xx. mylis fra the camp of
Scottis. Herdeut prince of Danis heirand y^ sa money Danis war slane at Berwik,
maid his aith to revenge their slauchter with sic cruelte, y^ na scottis salbe
left on live in Albion, and to bring his purpos to effect, he come with
displayit baner not far fra the samyn place quhare y^ scottis war liand in yair
tentis. Gregoure seand his ennymes arrayit before him, tuk purpos to have maid
ane orisoun to his army before y^ iunyng, quhen sudda^ly raise sic noyis and
clamor ama^g yame be desire of battall, yat it was mair necessar to array yame
than to exhort thaym to battall. Nochtheles he besocht yame to revenge ye
shamfull slauchter of king Constantyne slane treasonably eft yt he was taken.
Inco^tine^t ye scotts ^uschit forthwart with na les ma^heid tha^ preis, and
come sa fersly with their lang speris that yair ennymes had na laseir to schote
their dartis. After ye speris come the residew of Scottis with lang swerdis
^illis and axis in sic Ire, yat yai nedit na hortation. Thus war y^ Danis
vincust and chasit to the nixt montanis. The scottis followit with na les
cruelte in ye chase tha^ yai faucht before in ye battall, and be may violent
irruption they braik the trinschis, and come perforce within ye tentis of
ennymes, quhare ane huge slauchter was maid. On the morrow Herdeu^ colleckit ye
residew of his army, and (seand ma of yame slane tha^ was on live) he tuk
purpos to pas to Rasyne the great master of Danis in Ingland. Bot skarsly was
his army gane.xl. mylis, quhen sicker tithinges come, y^ Rasyne was slane and
all his army discomfist be Inglismen. And to his mair derisioun, his heid borne
on ane staik throw syndry townis and cieteis of Ingland. Apperit be their
nouellis ye proud empire of Danis was ^ast tending to rewine. Herdeut richt
astonist, and not knawing quhat was to be done (because his ennimes war liand
about him on every side) parkit his army in ane st^ate place with purpos to
remane, quhyll he war fynaly aduertist quhat ye remanent Danis intendit to do.

How Gregoure recouerit syndry la^dis of his realm* and slew Constantine
king of Britonis. How Scottis Britonis and Inglismen war confiderat aganis
the Danis. Ca. xx.
After this victory of Danis Northumbirland come under ye dominion of king
Gregoure. and al ye inhabita^tis yairof maid tributar to hes empire. Sone after
he skalit his army, and come to Berwik, quhare he tuk aduisement be quhat
ingyne he micht bring may felicite to his realm. At the beginning of the
nixt symer, he rasit his camp aganis the Britonis, quhilkis had ye time great
boundis of scotland, quhilk iornay succedit to him with na les felicite tha^
this other done before aganis the Danis. For ye Britonis attenuat and brokin ^e
frequent weris of Danis to be delyuerit of al da^geir apperi^g, gaif ane huge
sowme of money to ye said Danis, and tuk trewis with yame for, xx. eris.
Nochtheles ye danis abaid schort time at these peace, bot inuadit ye britonis
with mair cruel iniuris tha^ before. Ye britonis seand na band of amite nor
faith micht continue ye danis but ythand iniuris, se^d yair ambassatoures to
king Gregoure promitting to renunce al ye landis (y^ pertenit to ye empire of
scottis) sa yt he wald support yame aganis ye danis. Gregoure knawing (gif the
three pepyll of Albion, scottis, britonis, and Inglismen) war confiderat under
ane mind and pissance, na uncouth pepyll war to be dred, co^discendit to yair
desyris. Yus war scottis, Inglismen, and britonis fynaly agreit on al debaitis.
Al la^dis taken before fra scottis be yair weris ra^derit plesandly to Gregoure,
and ye realm of scottis dela^^t to the auld marchis. Ye peace tretit in this
manner, apperit na les terribil to ye danis, tha^ plesand to ye Albianis. Bot it
indurit schort time, for ye proud felicite fallin to Inglisme^ be victory of
danis and slauchter of Allarudus yair capitane, gaif occasion to britonis to
brek yis ba^d laitly maid with scottis. Sone after Constantine king of britonis
began to be penitent of yis ba^d maid with scottis, and to recover ye saidis
landis to his empire, he come with ane army i^ Anna^dale. Yus was ye peace
desoluit betuix scottis and britonis. Ye britonis se^d till Inglismen for
support, and because they war frustrat thairof, yai tuk ane huge pray of gudis
out of Annandale with purpos to pas with ye samyn i^ walis. King Gregour
aduertist of yir extorsio^is met king Co^sta^tine at Louch mabe^, quhare it was
cruelly fochtyn on al sidis. At last Constantine seand his ansene not ereckit
with sa per^ curage (as he desiri^) ruschit with may fervent curage to the
defense thairof. Quhare he fechtand with mair respect to his honor tha^ to his
life was slane. After quhais dei^^ followit sa huge slauchter of his stra^gest
campionis, that the Brytonis gaif bakkis, and war sa brokin with this
affliction, yt they come in may hatrent both to Danis and Scottis, and na
thing luffit with Inglismen. Nochtheles (that their realm should nocht faill)
they chesit Herb^rt (quhilkis was brothir to Constantine before slane) to be
their king. And send yair oratouris to king Gregour desiring peace. Saying the
violation of the band betuix thaym and Scottis was only be insolence of
Constantine, quhilk was punist justly for hes offense to great damage of
Britonis. And sen he was justly punist for his offense, na occasion apperit to
dissolve the band before contrackit betuix Scottis and Britonis. Atto^^e yai
schew yt their king Herbar^ was ane luffar of peace and desyris na thing sa
mekyll as to leave in amite with his nichtbouris the Scottis. To this message
was answerit be king Gregoure on this wise. Nothir the luffe of faith nor of
peace, nor it the reverence of band nor of aith hes mouit ye Britonis now to
seik peace ^t ws. Sen they but any respect to their faith or band come in
Annandale, wirkand importabyll iniuris b^t any occasion on Scot^is, bot only
because yai ar sa brokin i^ their pi^sance that they may not be party at this
time to ws, knawand na thing better than vter exterminion of their realm, gif
they perseueir any forthir with weris aganis ws. Yairfor schaw our king Herbart,
we will have na peace with him nor his treasonabyl pepyl, quhil y^ str^this and

Herbert sworn neuir to reclame ye saidis landis in times cumyng. And.lx. of

battall, Ye fynal euersion of his realm and his subdittis, condiscendit be
advise of his nobillis to fulfill all thingis, as yai war desyrit be Gregoure.
Als sone as plegis war geuyn in this manner, the Britonis left Cumbir and
Westmureland, and past in Walis. Tha^ Gregoure went to Carlyll, quhare he
assemblit his nobyllis to ane cou^sall, and said in this manner. It is patent
yneuch quhat felicite is cumyn to our realm be propiciant favor of god, sen
we began to honor him with true religion and faith, in sa far as he hes nocht

How king Gregoure come in Ireland to revenge certane iniuris done i^
Gallovvay* and how he dantit the samyn with syndry victoris* and was
governor thairof money eris* of his loving and deith. Ca. xxi.
THe peace ratifyit in manner forsaid, Gregoure beleuyng to have put fine to al
his weris, was constranit be new trubill of Ireland to renew the samyn. For
Ireland men come with ane great flote in Galloway. And tuke ane great pray of men
and gudis out of ye bou^dis yairof, Ye motive of yair weris (as yai allegit)
was ye men of Galloway spuleit two schippis of Dublyne after yt the samyn were
arriuit in yair watteris. Als sone as Gregour was aduertist yairof, he followit
with great d^ligence on yir Ireland men, and yai herand his cumyng, war sa
affrayit that yai sped yame with great deligence i^ yair cuntre. Incontinent
Gregour follwit on yame with ane army in Ireland, and maid all the princes
yairof* astonit be his cumyng. Schort time before his cumyng ye king of Ireland*
^es ^e^cissit, and had left behynd him ane oung child namit Duncane to succeid
to the crown. and throw his deith the princis of Ireland war contending amang
thaym for governance of the realm, and war deuidit in two opinionis. Brennus
was prince of ye ^a faction and Cornelius of the tothir. Now war ye scottis
tynnand throw all the cuntre with sa awful incursion of fire and slauchter,
that apperit without their fury war the mair haistely repressit, that ane great
part of Ireland should be distroyit. In the mean time sidry nobyl me^ of Ireland
labourit to make concord amang the foresaid princis, yt the realm be yair
dissension should not be ieoperd to extreme dangeir. And because sic thingis culd
nocht be dressit, they tuke ^rewis betuix yame for certane monethis to resist
their cruelteis. Their two pri^cis foresaid come with huge ^rmy to the river of
Bane, and set ^own their tentis in two syndry cu^panyi^ nocht far seuerit fra
other* ye ^yll (quhare their tentis lay) was sa strenthy, yat na army micht cum
on yame be industry nor ingyne of man keipand good array. This was done be
Ireland men to ye fine, ye king ^rego^^is army be production of lang time should
laik vittallis, nochtheles yair slichtis war vincust be wisdom of Gregour. for
ye scottis brocht sufficient vittallis of breid and cheis to sustene yam for.l.
days, and vnderstud weil (quhare euir yai com) yai micht haif fouth of watter
for their drink. Gregour seeing yt he micht not weil i^uaid his ennymes, tuk
consultation certane dayis quhat was to be done. And in ye mean time he
send.ii.M. me^ to ye bak of Mont fut within ye nicht, to ye fine yt als sone as
yai saw gregour inuading ye te^tis of Ireland me^, yai should cast down crages
and stanis on yair bakis* be quhilk way ye Ireland me^ should other suffir
i^tollerabi^ damage, or ellis constranit to geif batal. and quhe he had socht
be la^g auisement, quha should tak yis charge on hand, he ^and nane sa abil
yairto as Ke^neth thane of Carrik* Yis ke^neth come ouir the river of Bane
within ye nicht to the bak of this montane foresaid be ane difficile and strait
gait. On the morrow als sone as ye Ireland me^ maid yam with all yair power to
resist ye invasion of gregour, yair fell down sa huge cragis and stanis ^n yair
bakis vnprouisitly behynd yame, yat yai war constranit to leif yair tentis and
fle, eft ye.i.M. of yam war slane but any straik. Incontinent the scottis
followit with la^g chais, and brocht ane huge nowmer of prisoneris to king
gregour. In ye mean time ye tentis of Brennus war taken and him self found slane
be straik of ane stane. Cornelius the tothir capitane heirand sic displeseir
fallyn to his cumpanion, fled with all his folkis to Dublyne. Gregoure seand his
beginning succeid with sic felicite, co^mandit his folkis be scharp incursionis
to bring all ye bestial and gudis yat they micht get to their sustentation. And
to abstene fra fire and slauchter. And co^ma^dit thaym to do na iniure to agit
men, wiffis, nor barnis, and to bring all rank men (quhom they fand in their
gai^) presoneris to him. Money of yir Ireland pepill seand ye king so merciful
randerit thaym with yair munition and guddis, and were plesandlie ressauit.
Gregoure seand his army weil stuffit with vittallis, and na iniure of ennymes
apperand, laid ane strait sege to the town of Dongard. And eftir yt he had line
certane days at ye sege thairof, it was randerit to him* nochtheles he tuk bot
ane sobir money fra ye cietezanis i^ redemption of yair lyuis and guddes. quhe^
gregor had line.iii. days at Do^gard, he left ane buscheme^t of me^ to keip ye
said town, and past with his remanent army to sege ye town of Pontus. And because
it was randerit to him but any straik, he co^mandit na pray of guddis to be
taken fra thaym. Now was Gregour reddy to pas to sege the town of Dublyne, quhen
^ithingis come to him, that Cornelius the tothir capitane was cumand with
infinite noumer of pepill nocht ten mylis fra his army. Gregour heirand their
nouellis, left his purpos, and arrayit his folkis on the nixt planis. On ye
morrow apperit three battallis of Ireland men in sycht. Ye first was of lycht
bodin men arch^aris, castaris of dartis and slongis* The secound was of stout
men armit with coitis of maile and lang swerdis* In the third battall was
Cornelius with all the nobillis of Ireland, sworn to fecht with manheid and
curage to the deith, and armit with lang swerdis, billis, axis, and ledyn
mellis. Gregour seand this ordour of ennymes aganis him co^mandit ane
buschement of lang speris to set on the archearis. Be quhome money of the
Ireland men were borne with dynt thairof to the ground. Cornelius seand his
folkis put abak be yis way, co^mandit with great clamor to cut the speris. And
quhen he was rasyng the visare of his heumo^t to exhort his folks more
eirnistlie to fecht, he was hurt in the face with ane speir, and constranit to
pas out of the field. Throw quhilk the remanent army gaif bakkis. Followit more
slauchter in the chase* than was before in the battall. And continewit still on
thaym quhill yai were chasit within ye wallis of Dublyne. The Ireland men were sa
brokin be this battall, that they mycht assembill na army in times cumyng
aganis the Scottis. On the morrow Gregoure beltit the town of Dublyne with
strange sege. In this town was sa great noumer of pepill, that it was constranit
to seik peace. Sum of thaim alliegit more honest was to Ische and to ieoperd
thaym to extreme chance of fortoun, than to be subdewit to the empire of
Scottis. Otheris seand the great trubill and slauchter that was cumand on yame
be this last battall, dred (gyf yair nobillis were presently distroyit) to se
the vter euersion of yair realm. And thairfore send bischop Cormach ane man of
singular prudence to king Gregour, desiryng him to have miseratioun on thaym
and their town. And to saif their oung prince Duncane to quhome ye crown of
Ireland justly pertenit. And schew that vaileant campionis should have respect
as weill to their honor as proffet. Als it was na honor to him to make conques
on ane oung knycht, as to the town it was at his command with all ye cuntre
about it. And thairfore prayit him to auyse, quhiddir it was erar the office of
ane king to defend the rycht of princis and townis, or to se thaym brocht to
vter euer^^oun* king Gregoure answerit, he come nocht in Ireland to conques it.
Nor (...) to defraude his cosyng Duncane of ye crown. Bot only to revenge ye
ini^ris done to his pepil. For ye scottis mouit na weir quhil Ireland began it
first on thaym. And it he should a^ise how ane end micht be put to al his weris,
and saif ye crown hai^ quhil his cosyng Duncane were reddy to succeid. The
cietezanis of Dublyne heirand this answer oppinny^ ye por^is, and ressauit
Gregoure with all his army. Yan Gregour enterit with great ^riumphe in the town.
The pepill ^^^hit forth of al partis of ye town to meit him. Yan come ye
religius men (...) processioun. Amang quhome was bischop Cormach in solempnit
habit ^eirand ye croce. Eftir quhom come ye nobillis of Ireland falling all at
anis on yair kneis, and desiring grace. Gregour incontinent demontit of his
^ors, and with great veneration kis^ the ^roce. Yan Cormach said to him. We have
na litill cause to thank god, sen he hes ordanit ye to have auctorite above our
lyuis and guddis, yt hes put in the sic co^passioun and mercy, yat na cruelteis
ar exercit on ws be fire and swerd, howbeit ye samyn be rite of arms mycht be
esaly done. Gregoure enterand in the town on yis manner, left ane buschement of
armit men to keip ye stretis aganis al aduenturis yat micht fall. and als sone
as he had done his devotion in ye kirkis of our lady and sanct Patrik, he went
to the castle quhair he remanit al ye nycht. On ye morrow sindry scottis
(quhilkes ^uleit virginnis and matronis in the nycht before) were taken. And be
justice of yis wise prince put to deith quhilk thing causit him to be had in
great favor and benevolence with the pepill. Eftir yis ane counsall was se^
betuix Gregour and ye noblis of Ireland. In the quhylk peace was roborat under
their conditionis. oung Duncane king of Ireland salbe geuin in keeping of wise
preceptouris within the castle of Dublyne to teache him letteris. And king
Gregour salbe governor of Ireland during his tendir age. And sal ressaue al ye
strenthes and proffettis of the cuntre to gide the samyn in Justice. Attour na
Inglismen, Britonis, nor Danis without his conduct salbe ressauit in Ireland.
The I^elandmen swore with glaid cheir to fulfill all their poyntis. And the more
plesa^dlie, because Gregour wald nocht vsurp ye crown of Ireland i^ damage of
yair native prince. Howbeit he mycht have done ye samyn with litill damage.
All hatrent and weris peacifyit in this sort in Ireland, Gregour returnit with
his victorius army in Albion with.lx. pleges of ye noblis sonnis of ye region,
quhilkis were geuin to him for observation of al articlis before deuisit. Eftir
yis ye scottis had good peace but any trubil during al ye time of Gregour. Quhil
at last yis nobil prince protector of ye kirk, and hal^ar of his pepil in
equite na les pyssant in polecy, religioun and Justice, than in mercial glore
and deeds of arms, fell be la^g age in great maledy. and deceissit in Dudore

Of king Duffus* and how he was (...) with great infirmite be vvichecraft.
How he punist certane conspiratouris. and was slane. Ca. iiii.
After deith of king Indulphe, ane conuentioun was maid at Scone. In the quhilk
Duffus the son of Malcolme ye first was ma^d king. and Culyne son of Indulphe
maid prince of Scotland and lord of Cumbir. Duffus after his coronation went in
the Il^s, and callit before him all the Th^^is thairof, and maid his ai^h (gyf
they da^tit not the theuis within their boundis) to punis thaym na les than the
principal misdearis. The Thanis of the Ilis dreidand the seue^tie of the king,
tuk money sornaris and vaga^^ndis lymmaris of the cu^tre, and put yame to deith.
Thus war the remanent of their (...) pepyll constranit to fle in Ireland, or
ellis to seik sum craft to win their leisting. it syndry of the nobyllis tuk
indignation, that their freindis (quhilkis war cumyn of nobyll blu^e) should be
co^stanit to seik yair leisting on vile craftis. And the co^monis (quhilkis war
borne to seru^tude) war preseruit to yame i^ honouris and dignite, and thocht
thairfore ye king unworthy to regne above yame. This murmuration was not only
in the Ilis, bot in syndry partis of the realm. In the mean time king Duffus
fell in ane heavy maledy unknown to medcinaris in yai days. He was not only
trublit ylk day with new dolor, bot was resoluit in ane continewal sweit, and
micht get na rest nor sleip. Attour his maledy was ye mair in admiration, that
the aynd proceeding fra his vitale spreitis schew hes blude in dew proportioun
with soft puls^s. And nochtwithstandyng he grew sa leyne yt his body semit
haistely to euanis. The medcinaris disparit of his life and knawyng na remeid
aganis his infirmite, began be plesand wordis to make him consolation, sayng he
should reuert at the spring of the eir, quhen every thing be natural influence
conualescis. The king disparit finaly of his heil, send for all the capitanis of
ye tribis. and prayit yame to have sic sicht to their honor and co^moun weill,
that (nochtwithstandyng his infirmite) the realm micht be gouernit i^ peace
and Justice. The capitanis promittit to do al thingis as he desirit. Nochtheles
their raise ylk day continewal slauchter and reif in (...) partis of the realm
with mair trubil than may be rehersit. Ye medcinaris inhibit yir displesouris
to be schawin to the king. In adventure he tuk sic mala^coly yairthrow, that it
mycht haisty him to his deith. In ye m^ne time raise ane murmour amang the
co^monis, that the king was nocht trubillit with natural infirmyte. Bot only
be deuilry and craft of wichis. Of quhilkis great noumer was in Fores ane town
of Murray. Als sone as the king was informyt heirof, he send sindry wise and
craftye men to search the verite thairof. Yir men (quhilkis were send to yis
effect) schew thaym send to treit concord betuix ye king and ye murrayis. At
euin they entrit in ye castle of Fores and schew to Doneuald capitane thairof
ye cause of yair cumyng. And prayit him to search deligently gif sic thingis
(as ye fame schew) was of verite. The capitane gat finalie experience of all
this treasoun be ane of his soudiouris, quhilk had the douchter of the
principal wiche to his lamen. and gart her reueil in quhat house of the town
this wichecraft was vsit. Tha^ the kyngis seruandis with ane cumpany of
soudiouris enterit in the samyn house quhare their wichis were, and fand ane image
of wax maid to the similitude of Duffus drepa^d on ane treyne speit before the
fire. And fand ye wichis infundyng certane liquor on ye image with other
charms vsit to ye same effect. The soudiouris tuke their wichis incontinent,
and brocht thaym with the image to the castle, quhair they confessit, sa lang
as the walx meltit before ye fire, king Duffus was resoluit in perpetual sweit.
And sa lang as they et the said liquor on his image, he should neuir sleip. And
fra the walx was meltit away, ye king should de. Ye wiches were dema^dit, quha
lernyt thaym sic craft. And quha solistit thaym to the samyn, They answerit
they had the craft be ye devil. Bot the murrayis solistit thaym to sla ye king
be ye ingyne. Ye capitane brak the ymagis and brint their wichis. It is said ye
samyn nycht yt their wichis were taken on this wise in ye town of Fores, king
Duffus was deliuerit of all his maledy, and nocht only tuk good rest all ye
nycht, bot was restorit to his heil, as he had neuir been vexit with any
infirmyteis. And on ye morrow he come to Murray to punis certane rebellis ye
conspirit aganis his majesty. And maid sic delige^t persute on thaym in Ros,
Caithnes, and other partis quhair they fled, yt they were finalie brocht to
Fores and Iustifyit. Ama^gis quhom were slane sindry kynnismen and freindis of
Doneuald capitane of the said castle of Fores. Howbeit they cons^irit mair be
otheris than be yair awin persuasioun. This executioun of Justice mouit
Doneuald in sic hatrent for ye slauchter of his freindis, that he determit (gyf
he mycht find sufficient oportunite) to sla the king. Nochtheles he dissimilie
his Ire for ane time* his wife seand him ilk day more melancolius, dema^dit ye
cause of his displeseir. At last be la^g franyng of his wife, he schew quhat
schame ye king had done to him for his faithful service, puttyng his freindis
to may vile deith. Yis wife was ane woman of unmercifully cruel^e haua^d na
les hatre^t yan her husband had aganis ye king. for sindry of her freindis were
Iustifyit in ye samyn manner. Throw quhilk her ve^nomus Ire was boldin every day
with mair indignation, not knawing to quhom scho micht opin ye samyn. Bot quhen
scho vndstude her husband of ye samyn intentioun, scho exhortit him to be of
good cheir, and promittit to find ye way how this iniuris mycht best be
reue^git, sayng the king was oftymes familiarly lugit with yame, and mycht be
^saly punist. Doneuald was infla^mit be their wourdis above his hatrent, abiding
na thing b^t sufficient oportunite to sla ye king, and because ye king was to
depart on ye morrow, this Doneuald set him with more delige^ce to bring his
cursit purpos to effect. In the nycht following (als sone as the king had done
his devotion) he went to hes chalmer and fell on sleip. Yan was yis Do^euald sa
enragit with cruelte, yt he mycht get na eis quhil his cursit mind was fulfillit.
Inco^^inent he callit ye kings cubicularis to ane ba^ket and f^istit yame
co^tinewallie quhil yai were ^ane with ye wynis. and sa sop^^ yt they were
co^stranit to tak rest, hauand na suspitioun of yis treason de^isit in ye

(quhilkes were corruppit before with hes money) in ye kingis chalmer, and finaly
slew him. And brocht his body but any noyis out at ane postrain tw^ mylis fra
ye place, quhair he was slane to ane burn, and buryit it in ye myddis yairof
quhair ye streme vsit to pas. Syne put ane great stane above his body, yat na
thing should appeir hid in ye said place. Their tratouris ye slew ye king fled i^
Orknay, yt ye dee^ corpse should not schaw the slayaris. For it is haldin amang
ws, yt ye body of ane slane man bledis before ye slaa^. And quhiddir ye same be
true or not, lat yame testify yt hes experiene thairof. Doneuald eftir ye
slaucht of ye king (to cause him appeir innocent yairof) past the residew of

was slane, his bed bullerand in blud, and ye bodi taken away quhair na man wist.
Doneuald heirand ye noyis come in ye chalmer with ye remane^t cubicularis, as
he had knawin na thing of this treason. And because he saw the bed bludy, he
slew ye cubicularis as yai had been gilty yairof. and ran up and down ye castle
like ane furius man to se gyf he micht se any taikin of ye kings slaucht. At
last he fand the postra^^ opin, and Iugit tha^ ^^ckirl^e yt ye cubicularis had
slane ye king. For yai had ye keyis of ye castle in yair keeping. Ye noblis
richt astonist come haistely to seyis terribil deid hauand more admiration yt
ye bodi was taken away, ya^* of hes slaucht. Nochtheles sindry of yame tuk

sone eft yai returnit hame. Sex monethis eftir nothir son, moan, nor stern were

How Culyne prince of Scotland punist ye slaucht of king Duffus. Of sindry
uncouth meruellis seen i^ Albion. Ca. v.
CUlyne prince of Scotland and lord of Cu^bit, rycht astonist of yis perpetual
dirknes continewyng sa lang to ye great terror of pepill, demandit his noblis.
Quhat mycht be the cause yairof. Be quhom was answerit (as yai beleuit) god was
sa co^mouit at ye slaucht of ye nobill king Duffus, yat (gif ye samyn were nocht
punist haistelie) may terrible vengeance was to follow on their realm.
Inco^tine^t Culyne co^mandit general prayaris and ^asting to be done throw all
partis of ye realm. and maid his solemn aith neuir to ceis, quhill he punist
ye tresonable slaucht of duffus. Nocht lang eft he come in murray, and be his
cu^ing he maid ye murrayis rycht effrayit. Doneuald knawyng him self gilty of
this treason, fled to the mouth of Tay, ^uhair he pullit up salis to pas i^
norroway and had with him ye slayaris of king Duffus. For ye mind of al cursit
tyra^nis be natural inclination dreides every creature and schawis yame self
criminabil other in vult or co^tinance. and hes ay sic ^eir of yair life, y^
yai gif na man credence. bot eschewis al famus cu^pany, and co^fidis i^ na

be his fleing ye hid treason yt na man suspeckit, gif he had abidin ye ki^gis
cu^ing. Yus was he brocht to sic misery, yat quhair he was repute su^ time
familiar to ye king and lu^fer of hes common weil, he was haldin may odius
and treasonabil cowart. Ye pepil seeing him fle for suspicion of ye said treason
prayt god to send vengeance on him and his cu^pany, quhilk followit sone eft.
For Culyne heirand his deperting tuke ye castle of Fores, and fand i^ it
doneualdes wife with his three douchteris. Eftir la^g inquisition scho co^fessit
al ye manner of his deith. and how his body was hid in ye myddis of ane streme
with all circumstance as said is. On ye morrow (quhen ye pepil was passa^d to tak
up ye boby of Duffus, tithingis come ye Doneuald with his co^plicis was schip
brokin and taken be ye pepill to be punist for his offense. sone eft be co^ma^d
of Culyne he was brocht to Judgment with his wife and.iiii. serua^dis, and put
cruelly to deid, yair bodies quarterit and hu^gin in si^dry townis of yis realm
to be exampil to al pepil, quhat iniqite is to sla ane king. Ye takaris of
doneuald and his co^plicis were not only rewardit richely, bot exemit fra al
publik exaction in times cuming. Sic things done ye body of king Duffus was
taken up and brocht with great sole^pnite to Colmekil, quhair it was buryit. It is
said (youcht king Duffus lay.vi. monethis vnd erd) his body was als fresche of
color and hide as the first hour it was hid. and fra his body come above ye
erd, ye wedd cha^git to may serenite. Ane brig is now in ye samin place,
quhair his body was hid. Beside quhilk now is ane abbay of Cestius ordour namit

Of king Culyne, and his vicius life. Of the trubyl that fell in the realm be
hi^ evil ministration. Ca. vi.
DOneuald slane in yis manner, Culyne was maid king. In ye ferd eir of king
Duffus, fra ye incartion.ix.c.lxxii. eris. Ye pepil beleuit y^ he should haif
been ane nobil prince, seand him begin with sa souerane Justice. Howbeit litill
virtew was seen in him eft. For he gouernit not ye realm be advise of his
noblis. bot geuin be rage of outh to may insole^t and corruppit life. and
throw his vice he gaif occasion to his pepill to grow wildar vnd his empire,
yan euir ya^ war vnd any other price before. Finalie ye realm was brocht to sic
point, ye theuis, reuaris, and s^clik pepil were not only vnpunist bot had in
greit estimation. Sa great truble raise Ilk day more and more in ye ^untre, ye
(gif ye samyn were not haistelie punist) ye realm apperit to cum to vter

his misgouerna^ce* he maid litill excuse. bot said, ong me^ were not lik i^
conditionis to agit personis. Yairfor his outh behuffit to have ane course,
quhill it were stabillit be process of time. And should not beda^^it be ouir great
seuerite bot to be moderat according to the season yairof. Attour his
antecessouris Indulphe and Duffus were ouir se^eir in administration of Justice,
as apperit in ye end of yair empire. For quhen they intendit vnd culloure of
Justice to oppres yair noblis to conqueir yair landis or guddis, yai mouit
their noblis to rebellion in final destruction of yame self. Better was
yairfore to regne with favor and benevolence above his noblis, than to regne
with ma^nassing and terror* for be y^ and be na other way mycht his nobillis
be haldin at hes opinion. Yocht this answer of king Culyne was unprofitable to
the co^moun weil, it na man durst oppinly repreue the same. For every man
co^mendit his governance specially yai y^ haiti^ Just or pru^e^t men. Ye
noblis seand ye kings familiaris ilk day more insole^t, and na thing done to
ye vtilite of ye realm, drew thaym fra ye court. Otheris (as bane flatteraris
and nurisari^ of vennom in oung personis) set yarne to co^^inew ye king in his
voluptuous life inducyng him to al thingis yt mycht affeminat his mind in may
schameful vices* quhil at last yis unhappy prince was brocht to sic misery, yt
he had sicht to na thing bot only to his sensual plesouris. and cherist nane
bot may vicius and vile lymmares. and nocht only he deflorit sindry uncouth
virginis and matronis. bot als fuleit his awi^ sisteris his douchteris and
religious women. He had also ane cu^pany of vicius herlottis thai did na other
thing, bot espyit quhair yai micht se any plesand virginis or matronis, ye yai
mycht aduertis him yairof. And finalie they were ay brocht to him other be weir
or peace. i^ ane thing followit more miserable. Als sone as ye king had taken
his lust and pleseir of yir virginis, he causit his unhappy seruitouris to
deflore yam eft him in ye same manner. Gif any co^planit of yir odius cruelteis,
yai gat na other amendis, bot yair leggis or armies brokin. And yocht yis
effeminat mo^stour had waistit his body with ouir frequent cumpany of women, it
he tuke pleseir to se his familiaris conuers with yame opinlie in his sycht.
And was abusit in yis manner three eris continually. Throw quhilk he grew not
only ane defamit creature Bot throw his misgouernance raise al manner of truble
and displeseir to his subdittis. The^is, reuaris, sornaris and oppressouris
raise with sic pissance, yat na man durst punis yame. gif any man maid him to
resist yame or co^plene, he was sone eft slane, or else his guddis confiscat
and his bigingis brint. And nocht only temporal men bot als spretual were
heryit in ye same manner. Yair guddis and orname^tes taken be force. Throw quhilk
ye co^monis and landwart pepill leiffit money eris in great oppression and
misery. King Culyne at last throw his surfeit and vnbridillit lust fell i^ ane
may vile and schamful infirmite, his nature slidyng but any pleseir or
persauyng. And throw this maledy his body and visage grew ilk day so attenuat
and leyne, yt he past ye residew of his dayis with great dishonor and schame.
The noblis nochtwithsta^dyng his heaviness, maid ane co^uention at Scone to
deprive him of auctorite, and to cheis ane new king* als sone as Culine knew
quhat was diuisit aganis him, he past with ane quiet cu^pany to Scone. In ye
mean time Cadardus thane of Meffen met him unhappily be ye gait. and slew him
because he deflorit his doucht before. This end maid ye vicius tyrane Culyne
according to hes cursi^ life* in ye.v. eir of hes regne. fra ye
i^carnation.ix.c.lxxvi. eres. and was buryit in colmekill.

Of king Ke^neth ye.iii. and his gouerna^ce* of his o^ison maid to ye noblis*
and how he co^stranit yame to bring sindry theuis to his Justice. Ca. vii.
CUlyne slane (as said is) Ke^neth bruthir to king duffus was maid king. In ye
beginning of his empire he had great laubour to bring ye pepil (quhilk was
growin wyld be necligence of Culyne) to virtews leuyng. For it is ane thing
daily practicat amang ws. First ye noblis and syne the co^monis followis ye
maneris of the king. Gif ye king be virtews. Ye pepil be his imitation inclinis
to virtew. Quhen he is vicius, ye pepil on ye samyn manner followis his vicis.
King Ke^neth (yt he should not detest ye schamefull deformiteis in otheris
quhilkis were appera^d i^ himself) schew him to y^ pepill as ane chaist pi^rce,
of skairs fude, liberal and meik in all his doings, hating al scurrilite. He
banist all tauernaris, dru^kartes, scaffaris and vane flecheouris out of his
house. and nuris^ concord both with uncouth and domistik pepill* so far he
haitit al sedition yat he punist ye mouaris yairof to ye deith. and had sic
affection to ye common weil, yt na man was sufferit to abid in hes court, bot
sa money as had sufficient virtew and craftis to win yair leuing. Yus were his
subdittis nothir effeminat be la^g sleuth. Nor it Irkit with exercition of good
werkis. Yis prince for his virtews governance was reput may worthy to regne
above his pepil, and tuk purpos to pas throw all boundis of his realm for
punition of theuis. At his cu^yng to Lanerk, come sindry of his subdittis to

li^maris of ye cuntre. Als sone as their lymmaris were aduertist yat ye king was
to sit in Judgment for execution of Justice, ya^ fled be assistence of ye
noblis in the Ilis. Ye king rycht co^mouit yt he was stoppit on this ma^^ be
his nobillis to do Justice, supersedit his displeseir for ane time. and in ye
eir nixt following, he maid ane general co^ue^tion of hes noblis at scone. In
ye nycht before his conuention he hid ane noumer of armit men in ane quiet
chalmer, nocht far fra ye place quhare y^ counsal was set, co^ma^ding yame to

and tranquillite. it their misdoaris in co^temption of our auctorite co^pe^it
not in Judgment. And youcht I know na thing bett than yair co^uoying away be
assistence of great men. it I supersed it yis offense quhil more oportunite

yait k^^h, and conuoyit yame fra our Justice. Attour ye frequent message send
betuix ow and yir theuis makand (...) d^lig^^ce til bring yame to our Justice,
hes maid ye mat more credible. Noctheles in quhat sume^ir way ye mat standis,
we have remouit all suspitioun, gyf we have had any aganis ow* and haldis ow at

e put their charges to execution, ye more haistelie sal e be deliuerit of

majesty, and promittit not only to do al charges as he desyrit. Bot to remane
quhair he plesit quhill yair frei^dis had brocht yir mis^oaris and rebels to

How ye Danis inuadyng ye Scottis with great cruelteis war discomfist be king
Ke^neth, and how ye Hayis tuk yair first beginning and arms. Ca. viii.
THe Danys ilk day rageand i^ more hatre^t, because they had muir sufficiently
reuengit the frequent murdir maid on yair freindis be the weris of scottis,
arriuit with ane great flor in Albion. And were determi^ as it was weil prouin in
ye end of their weris, in quhat sumeuir part of albion yai arriuit, to remane
their with continewall reside^ce. and other be force of arms to subdew ye

ye reid brayis in Angus, quhare now standis ye abbay of Abi^brothok dedicat to
the honor of sanct Thomas of Canterbery. Eftir ye ordour of sanct Benedict.
Part of ye Danis gaif counsall to land not in yir partis, bot erar to pas in
Ingland. For ye scottis of yat regioun were rycht vaileant, and with frequent
battallis did oftymes great damage before to ye Danis. And sen yis landis
(quhair they were new arriuit) were more plenteus of treis yan of cornis, It was
not proffitable to ieoperde yame for sa small regionis. Be contrary landis of
Ingland liand to ye south were more rich, and the pepill thairof geuin to na
thing les than to cheualry, and mycht yairfor the more esaly be subdewit.
Forthir gif they couat any rich landis in albioun but any extreme dangeir
eftir following, best was in pas in Kent. Otheris said yai were not arriuit
(...) albion only to co^q^^^ landis (...) to revenge the iniuris done be
scottis, quhilkis were ane bludy p^pill mair curious in defense of other mennys
guddis, than yair awin, as was prouin in ye last battal f^uchtin in
Northumbirland, quhen yai come in support of Inglismen. And yairfore als sone
as yai ar cumyn in Kent, yai salbe co^stranit to fecht not only aganis
Inglismen, bot aganis scottis. Be contrar gif yai abaid in scotland, yai should
fecht all^ne^lie with scotts. Yus was it best to inuaid ye scottis first. And
quhen ye scottis were distroyit to pas th^n with recent victory on Ingland, and
commit ye remane^t chargi^ to the chance of fortoun. The danis weary be lang
truble of seis, applaudit to yis last opinion, and landit finalie beside
Montros. and not only tuk ye town bot slew al pepil taken in it, and brak down
the wallis thairof to ye ground. and sone eftir yai come throw ye remanent
bou^dis of Angus to ye firth of Tay, ceissyng fra na manner of cruelte yt mycht
be deuisit. Ye people effrayit be yir displeseiris com to king Ke^neth. For he
was than in Striuelyng occupyit i^ ministration of Justice, and beleuyng na

aduisement (yat his realm should not be patent to more extorsionis), He
co^mandit be general edict al fensable personis to meit him at ane schort day.
and finalie at ye day affixit, he come with ane army to ye mouth of Erne. On ye

sege about ye castle of Be^tha with sic insu^^e^able cruelte. Ya^ na kind of
pepil, townis, nor ki^kis (quhair yai were maisteres) were sauit. The king mouit
with yir iniuris, rasit his army with may deligence (...) hes ennymes. In ye
nycht f^llowing he come to Loncarte, quhilkis ane town not far fra Tay. Ye
d^nis na thing affrayit of his cumyng arrayit yame to battal. Yan Ke^neth
arrayit his folks in ane ganand pl^^e. And to move his noblis with her curage

Duf pr^ce al Scotland and lord of Cu^bir was arrayit in ye rycht wyng. And
Du^cane thane of Athole in ye left wyng. In ye myd battall was king Kenneth. On
the tothir side ye danis were arrayit a^ ye fut of ye hill not far distant fra
ye scottis. Ye armyis s^ude la^g arrayit in otheris sycht, quhill at last ye
scotts ouir feirs and desyrus of battall, come with incredible schoure of
dartis, arowis and ganeis on ye danis* and (...) impacient to sustene yis

Iuny^, but any sign of (...)* and faucht sa fei^slie ye nane of yame mycht
sustene the preis of other. And youcht lang bargane followit with vncertane
victory, it na thing was more impediment to scottis yan yair desire to have
the heidis of danis erar yan victory. quhe^ yis was knawin to danis. yai cryit
with schil voce other to have victory or al atanis to de. And incontinent yai
ruschit with sic properant fard, ye both ye wingis of scottis were put to
flycht. Nochtheles ye myd battall resistit vaileantlie the hail preis of
ennymes. Now stud^ our army i^ extreme dangeir. For money of ye scottis fled,
and were cruelli^ slane be danis. This day had been ye vter exterminion of
scottis, wir not ane land wart man namyt Hay with his two sonnis of strange and
rude bodyis (howbeit they were of may nobill curage) come haistelie in support
of Kenneth and his nobillis, eftir they were neir vincust with yair ennimes.
This Hay hauand na wapinnis bot the ok of ane pleuch and seand the myddilward

na thing sa honorable as to de vaileantlie amang sa money nobill men* than was
ane strait passage nocht far fra ye battall, quhare great noumer of scottis were
slane miserabill^e ^l^yng. This Hay traisting na thing sa gud^s to stop the
fleyng of the scottis, a^aid in this strait passage with his two sonnis. And
slew both danis and scottis quhom he fand fleand with his ok. In ye mean time
ane certane of scottis (quhilkis were richt forcy and vaileant) cryit with
schill voce. All good scottis men return ^ renew battal for defense of our king
and realm. And auise now quhiddir it is more honest to ieoperd ow with good chance
in defense of our prince, than to be schamfullie murdrest in our fleing. This
Hay with his two so^nis n^mit (as said is) with okis of a ple^ch ahaid in this
strait passage and cons^ranit the scottis (quhilkis were fleand) to return with
him to battal aganis yair ennymes. Ye danis astonist be yair returnyng, and
trai^^ing sum new army cu^ing on yair ^akkis, le^t the chase of scotts and

war rasit with new spreit and curage ruschit feirsly on yair ennymes, and pu^
yame to flicht, great slacht was maid i^ ye battal, bot mair in ye chase. Ye
scottis gat these day ane glorius victory of danis, be perseuerant fechting of
ye noblis of scotland in ye mid battal to ye deith* it may hono^ succedit to
Hay and his so^nis, for he helpit to win ye fe^ld eft yt it was discomfist. Ye
scottis past ye nicht after this victory with singing, dansing, and incredibil
blithnes. On ye morrow Ke^neth gaif ye may part of al ye spule of yis battal
to Hay and his so^nis. ye remane^t yairof war deuidit be rite of arms amang

co^mandit yis Hay and his sonnis to be clothit with rich claithes and to
follow him to ye said castle. Bot Hay na thing desiring yairof come with his.ii.
so^nis ^ yair auld and rusty habit strinklit with dust and sweit of battal. In
the samyn manner as yai faucht reddy to do quhat chargis he micht at ye kingis

singular ma^heid had saiffit ye king and ye realm standing in may da^geir of
ennimeis, come with great multitude, and co^uoyit yam (as vphalda^es of ye
realm) to ye kingis palice. Hay accu^panit with huge pepyll in yis wise, enterit
in ye kings palice, b^ra^d ye ok on his schulderis i^ ye same manner as he
faucht aganis ye Danis. Sone eft ane couns^l was set at Scone, i^ ye quhilk Hay
and his so^nis war maid nobil, and dotat for yair singular virtew prouin i^ yis
field with sindry la^dis to sustene their estait. It is said yt he askit fra ye
king certane la^dis (quhilkes he knew richt plentuous before) liand betuix Tay
and Arole, and gar als mekil yairof as ane falcon flew of ane (...) hand or

three reid scheildis in ane field of silver to beir in manner of armis in place
of ye ok, to signify yt he was promouit fra small and obscure lynnage to great
honors, riches, and la^dis. Attour yair was rikit to his arms y^ figour of

After their disco^fitouris of Danis, followit sindry co^tentionis in yis realm.
Ye men of Ilis tuk ane huge pray of gudis out of Ros. nochyeles yai war al taken
and slane be pepil of ye cuntre. Als sone as yis trubyll was pecifijt, followit
ane other in Angus and Mernis of greter motion. Yair was ane man namit
Cruthneth quhilk gaderit the kyngis m^lis of all ye landis of Angus liand
betuix south Esk, and north Esk. He had ane doucht namit Fenel, quhilk had ane

castle of Delbogyn, quhare his good schir was and be his insolence fell at sic
debait for ane cause of nocht, ye.ii. of his serua^dis war slane him self
narrowly eschaping with hes life. So^e ^ft he com to Fethircarn quhare he met his
mother, and schew to her this ^iur^ laitlie done to him, and scho na thing mesi^

of ye mernys, and returnit within ye nycht to the said castle, and not only
slew his gudschir. Bot left nane on live within ye said castle. And on ye morrow
he brocht ane great pray of guddis out of Angus. The men of Angus impacient to
suffer their heirschippis, raise with great cu^panyis. and maid heirschippes and
slaucht in the Mernis on ye samyn manner. ^yng Kenneth knawing how ^acill ye
ingyne of his pepill was to rebellion (quhen na punitioun was maid their eft)
beleuit gif their attemptatis ^^er nocht haistelie danti^, more sedi^ioun should
rise haistelie on damage of his realm. And thairfore he summond al yame yt
were suspicius of this cruelte both of ye Mernis and Angus (...) co^peir at
Scone ye.xv. day ^ftir following to underly ye law under panys of rebellion.
And because yai comperit not, the king followi^ on yame with sic diligence, y^
yai war al taken and brocht to Donsi^^^ane. Cruthlint and ye principal monaris
of this ^rubil war put to deith. Yis execution of Justice brocht king ke^neth
knew favor to his pepil with sic affection, ye nane of yame wald heir nor suff^^

of his regne this prince sa lang decorit with Justice co^mittit ^ne may
schamfull slauchter, quhilk appe^it the mair sichty, yt his life was reput
before may innocent, and geuyn for ye common weill. Ye blind and immoderat
affection (yt he had to his son) was occasion yt he slew be poison Malcolm Duf
prince of scotland and lord of Cu^bir. yt Malcolme his son my^ht succeed to ye
crown of scotland, and it na man beleuit ye sic cruelteis was committit be him,
because al other wayis he apperit ane just prince. king kenneth after the deith
of Malcolme the prince, send in sindry kirkis to do funeral obsequies for his
saul, and he micht not refrene fra teris, quhen he herd his name spokyn.
Nochtheles syndry of ye noblis suspeckit him of ye princis deid, persauyng him
dissimulat and his dolor exceeding ye just affection of his mind. it because al
thingis ar vncertane, the pepyll left yair suspicion. In ye mean time sa^ct
Edward (quhilkis was after martyrit be his stepmoder Esculda) send hes
ambassatouris to Ke^neth, schawing him richt commouit for the deith of Malcolme
prince of scotland. Nochtheles sen all pepyl ar mortal, he desirit yt the two
realms micht perseueir in athir fre^dschip after ye tennour of ye auld peace,
and to ^heis ane ^thir prince of Cu^bir, yat war wise and ^uri sar of peace
betuix ye two pepyl. Ke^neth answerit he was na thing penitent of ye band maid
betuix him and Inglismen, and wald ratify and apprei^ ye samyn in times cumyng,
as to ye election of ye prince, he schew yat he wald convent his noblis on the

return agane on ye said morrow, yt they micht heir quha war declarit prince of
scotland and lord of Cumbir. Than Ke^neth callit his noblis to ane counsall at
Scone and said in this wise. Gif e have sicht to ye weil of this realm and to
ye tranquillite of ye pepyl yairof with lang perseuera^ce in times cumyng
(discreit and wise faderis) it is necessar to have not allanerly respect to the
administration and governance of this realm in times bygane, bot als i^ times
cumyng, specially concerning the institution of o^^ prince. e man consider
quhat maneris quhat governance and auctorite ^^^cernis ane prince. The ingyne
and maneris of al pepil ar mutabyl, and corespondent to the season as it
occurris. Oftymes succeding to the worst. New maneris requiris new lawis. It is
thairfore not discrepant to Justice concerning ye reparation of our errouris to
use ye thing ama^g ws, quhilkis are institute be reason and lawis and vsit in all other realms. And yocht auld ritis war sum time plesand to our eldaris. it
they ar found now vnproffitabyll. Ane law was maid after Fergus ye first, yat
because his sonnis Maynus and Ferlegus war not abyl to govern the realm for
yair tender age, yat the nerrest of their blud abyll to do Justice for ye time
should be king. Quhilk beand deceissit ye son of the king before deceissit (gif he
war abil) should succeid but any pley. It was defendit be the samyn law to eschew
inco^uenientis, yat na children of tendir age sal succeid. And yocht this law
was found proffitabyl to sindry for the time. It apperis be my Judgment
contrarious and noysum to ye common weil, nurisand extreme hatrent ama^g nobyl
men. Was not Ferithais the secou^d king (yat rang after Fergus) slane be
Ferlegus, howbeit the said Ferlegus was banist for the samyn cause, and endic^^^
dayis in misery. Thus succedit doubyl s^aith. Ferlegus banist, and Ferithais
slane. Siclik be this cursit law followit displeseir to the realm, quhe^
Reuther was maid king to the great murdir both of scottis and pichtus, and
euerson of their common weil, quhilk was brocht to sic calamite, that after the
murdir of may forcy campionis, all the nobillite of scottis and pichtis war
other banist or put to seruytude. And youcht the realm was restorit to the
auld stait, it followit frequent slauchter of ye may nobyl and vaileant men
of this realm, throw quhilk not only the realm was haldin in perpetual
trubyl, bot may tender cosingis co^stranit be suspicion to fecht amang yam
self for the empire. Oftymes the just heritour of the crown slane, and not only
men of obscure lynnage brocht to great riches, bot money nobyll men put down and
murdrist. Forthir throw yis cursit law, al vaileant men war degenerat in
cowardis. Humyl men in bludy mo^stouris. Just me^ in auaticius tyra^nis.
Liberal men in gredy reuaris. Chaist men in lichorus vela^is inuading the
pepyl with may odious cruelteis. Amang all other skaithis (quhilkis may nocht
be rehersit but displeseir) oung children (quhilkis had just tytyll to ye
crown) war murderit be thaym that had the realm in governance quhen they
desyrit mercy in yair faderis arms. Quhat cruelte quhat detestabyl fellonyis
been hard in any realm in comparysoun of sic thyngis as been done be motioun
of this cuesit constitution* Thairfore may prudent faderis provide above all
thyngis that this cursit law. (be quhilkis the kingis son is disherist of his
just heritage) be abrogat. Because the samyn is sa iniurius that it hes nuri^^
amang ow money unthankful displeseiris contrar to the law of god and man. And
be irrecouerabyl damage hes brocht our common weil neir to vter euersyoun.
Suffer heirfore nane other bot the kyngis son to regne above ow in times to

of ye king may immediately succeed, nochtwithsta^ding quhat sumeuir age he be

How ye auld lavvis war abrogat be Kenneth concerning ye election of kingis,
and n^vv lavvis contrar to yame institute. Of the vision yat come to him in ^is
bed, and of his deith. Ca. x.
QUhe^ Kenneth had endit this orison, certane of his familiaris come amang ye
noblis desi^ing yame to cheis Malcolme ye son of ^e^neth to be lord of Cu^bir,
yt he mycht be ye way ye better cu^ to ye crown after his faderis deid. And
quhe^ ye noblis were aduising degestly on yis ma^er, Kenneth inquirit yame quhom
they desirit to be lord of Cumbir and regent on ye bordouris betuix Inglismen
and scot^is. In ye samyn time war.ii. nobil me^ of great auctorite in ye
counsal, yt ane was namit Constantine son to king Culme, and yis other namit
G^ime neuo to king D^ffus, quhilkis war ^ust heritouris to ye crown after
Ke^neth be ye auld lawis. nochthelis for feir of yair liffis they said, it was
at his will to make not only quho^^ he list prince of Cu^bir, bot als to abragat
ye auld lawis and to creat new institutionis conform to his purpos as he
plesit. Ye residew of ye noblis following the vocis of thaym declarit Malcolme
ye son of Kenneth lord of Cu^bir, howbeit he was oung and vnabyl to beir any
auctorite. On ye morrow yir ambassatouris of Ingland war depeschit and ressauit
ou^g Malcolme to make his obedience to king Edward for ye landis of Cu^^ir. Sic
thingis done king Ke^neth be aduis^ of his noblis abrogat ye auld l^wis
concerning ye creation of yair king, and maid new lawis in manner as followis.

The king beand deceissi^, his eldest son or his eldest nepot (notwithstanding
quhat sumeuir age he be of* and youcht he war born after his faderis deith) sal
succeed ye crown.

The nepote gottin on the kingis son salbe preferrit to the nepot^ gottin on
the kingis douchter.

On the samyn manner the nepote gottin on ye kingis bruthir salbe preferrit to
ye nepot gottin on his sister. The samyn lawis salbe obserui^ ama^g al otheris
noblis of yis realm in succession to their heritage.

Quhen ye king is oung, ane nobil man of great prudence and auctorite salbe
chosin governor of ye realm quhil ye king be cumyn to ye age of xiiii. eris,
quhilk eres beand ^^trun the king salbe fre to govern his realm be his awin
auctorite.

All other heritouris sal succeed to yair faderis heritage after ye ysche of
xxi. eris, and within ye time they salbe gouernit be yair curatouris, and quhil
ye eir be out run, they sal not be admittit to clame their heritage.

Kenneth trai^ing the realm sta^illit to him and his posterit^ be their lawis,
gouernit the commonis in great Justice and (...) the noblis be donatioun of
landis and guddis in favor, and youcht he was rep^t richt happy be sindry
opinio^^s. it he was may unhappy to him self, euir dredand in his mind, yat
ye innocent slauchter of Malcolme Duf (quhom he before poisonit) should (...)
su^tyme to licht, and was sa full of susp^tio^, yt he beleuit quhen any man
r^undi^ to his fallow, that they spoke evil of him. For it is geuyn be nature
to ylk creature, yt quhen he is gylty of any hor^ibyll crime be impulsion of
his conscience to i^terpret every thing yt he se^s to su^ terror of him self.
In the samyn manner, yocht Ke^neth had his realm in good tranquillite but any
invasion of ennymes. it he had great trubyll in his mind. At last quhen he was
lyand in his bed he hard ane voce as apperit be su^ vision say and to him in
this manner. O ke^neth belief not yt ye cursit slaucht of Malcolme Duffe is hid
to god. O thou unhappy tyrane (quhilk for desire of ye crown) hes slane ane
innocent, inuading thy nichtbour with treasonabill murdir, quhilk thou wald
have punist with may rigor, gif it had been done be any other person than
thy self. And yairfor thou hes incurrit sic hatrent of god, yt both thou and
thy son salbe haistely slane. For now sindry of thy noblis ar ^spirit in thy
deith. Traisting (quhe^ thou and yi son ar slane) to reiose ye crown at yair
pleseir. Ye king was sa affrayit be this voce, yt he past ye remanent nicht with
great noy and displeseir. On the morrow he maid his confession with good
repentance (...) ane haly byschop namit Mou^ane, and confessit ye crime in ye
samyn manner as it was done. Moueane heira^d him penitent persuadit him to do
pe^nance, and said yocht his offense was odius, god was mercyful. Finaly king
Ke^neth be cou^s^l of yis haly man began to do sindry works of piete. and left
nocht undone ye pertenit to ane ^rist^ prince. At last he went to Fordoun
quhilk is ane town of Mernis) quhare Palla^ius ye blissit appostyll of scottis
lyis haldin i^ great veneratio^. And quhen he had done his pilgrimage, he come
to ye castle of Fethircarn, and was lugit with Fenella lady yairof. Yis
Fenellla was ane tender cosingnace to Malcolme Duf before slane be ke^neth, and
als to Constantine and Grine, quhilkis had sum titil to ye crown. Attour scho
had extreme hatrent aganis Ke^neth for ye slaucht of her son Cruth^ynt, quhilk
was slane before be his Justice. This woman rageant in Ire aganis ke^neth for
causis aforesaid couth not rest, bot deuisand alwayis how scho miche may
esaly sla the king. And because scho knew the mind of kenneth geuyn to
magnificent bygyng and polesy, scho brocht him in ane toure of ye said castle,
quhilk was thekit with copper, and he win with may subtle muldry of sindry
flouris and ymagerijs. Ye werk sa curious yt it excedit al ye stuf yairof. This
toure was apparalit inwth with rich tapestreis of gold and sylk. And behynd
thaym war crosbowis bendit with ganeis reddy to schute. In the mids of these
house was ane image of bras maid to ye similitude of kenneth, with ane goldin
apill in his hand with sic ingyne, yt als sone as any man maid him to throw yis
apill out of ye hand of ye image, the wrying of the samyn drew all the ^ituppis
of the crosbowis up at anis, and schot at him yt threw ye apill. Als sone as
kenneth was brocht in this toure i^ manner foresaid, na thing knawing ye treason

About yis time war seen money meruellis in Albion. stanis ranit both in France

On ye tothir side king Constantine gaderit ane army of sic pissance, yt he
chasit Malcolme in Cu^bir. Thus had Malcolme comin to may schamful confusion,

Of king Gryme and of great trubyll yat fell betuix him and Malcolme prince of

GRime nepot to king Duf heirand how unhappily king Co^sta^tyne and ke^neth war
slane at Crawmond, gaderit ye residew of king Co^stantinis army, and come to
Scone, quhare he was crownit be te^nour of ye auld lawis. Als sone as Gryme had
taken ye crown in this manner, he intertenit ye freindis of Constantine with
may liberalite and pleseir he micht, and conquest the favor and benevolence
of the pepyll in money sindry wayis. And fynaly to stabyll ye crown to him with
mair sicker firmance, he rewardit sindry freindis of Malcolme with landis and
riches. and of otheris (quhilkis war to him repugnant) co^fiscat yair guddis,
halding thaym as ennymes to the co^moun weill. Malcolme prince of Cumbir richt
sorrowful ye Gryme had taken the crown on this wise, callit all his freindis to
ane counsal to advise in this matter, and dissimilit his mind, as he regardit
not the power of Gryme. it money of his freindis persuadit him to co^tempne not

cou^salit him to contend aganis Gryme erar with wisdom than pissance, geuand
hes labor (gif he micht) to draw the noblis fra his mind. Malcolme be their

abaid at his opinion) to govern ye realm in sic felicite, yt al occasion of

king Gryme, and solistit their freindis, to ye same effect. Othe^es tuk their
seruandis of Malcolme, and send yame bound (as tratoures) to Gryme, quho^ he

And forthir it was schawin, ye sic ^reason was i^ his army, y^ (gif he eid

Gryme mouit be yir words a^suerit, yt he wald condescend to have peace. sa it
war not degrading to his honor, for he was king be ye auld lawis vsit sa money

bot fecht for ye samyn aganis Malcolme and al ye war of his opinion to ye end

How great novvmer of Danis war slane be slicht of Inglisme^, of ye orison
maid to king gryme be ye noblis, and how he was slane be Malcolme prince of
Cumbir. Ca. xiii.
QUhill sic things war i^ scotland. Eldred was maid king of Ingland be deceis
of his brothir sanct Edward. Yis Eldred sufferit great oppressionis of Danis,
quhilkes be yair weris intendit to sit down with yair wiffis, children and
freindis i^ his realm. and finaly yai wrocht sic heirschippis and cruelteis in all pertis quhare yai come* yt nothir peace nor it yair faith before contrackit
be virtew of sacrament, micht cause yame to leif i^ peace. Yus apperit na thing
mair sicker, tha^ plane euersion of ye realm of Ingland. King Eldred to ceis
yis cruelte set ane cou^sal of his noblis, in ye quhilk was deuisit secretly to
sla al ye danis ye war in Ingland on ane day. Yis subtell slicht had cumin
finaly to hand, war not ye danis war aduertist yairof, and eschewit the murdir

residew of danis (quhilkes war eschapit fra this murdir) mouit be ye slauchter
of yair freindis, garnist al strenthis and castellis quhare yai had any bounds
wtin Ingland, and send to Sueno king of Denmark for support to revenge ye
treason done to thaym be gyle of Inglismen* quhil sic thingis war done in
Ingland, king Grime be afflue^ce of riches and lang peace was degenerat fra his
liberalite and chais^ life, in may corruppit and auaricius living. And quhe^
he had slane sindry noblis of scotland (as oftimes occur^es) to co^ques yair
la^dis and gudis, he oppressed ye pepil ylk day be mair tyranny. Ye pepil knawing
na mortal Judge above him to punis his cruelte, eft lang regrait of insufferabil
iniuris sustenit be yame, fell on kneis makand invocation to god ye punisar of
syn to have piete of yair affliction, and to change ye realm in su^ bett
governance* Ye noblis hauand great indignation in lyk wise of ye trubil falling
both to yam ^ yair co^monis, send ane certane of g^ntyl me^ (as ambassatouris
to king Gryme, persuading him in yair name to deuoid him of unhappy and
mischeuous limmaris, in quho^ he had ouir great confidence (as apperit) to ye
damage of his common weill. Ane of y^^ ambassatouris (to quho^ ye charge was
geuyn) said in yis manner. W^ (quhilkis ar ane part of thy noblis and ouir true
to yi crown) ar cumyn to persuad ye (gif we may) to ye weil of thy self and yi
realm. It is not unknown to ye (richt nobil prince) quhat infinite calamite
and trubil hes been done yir sindry eres to thy leges be insaciabyl avarice of
yir unhappy and mischeuous li^maris thy serua^dis. Ye schame and displeseir
heirof may not be weill excusit bot redou^dis ay to thy may dishonor and
sleuth. Heirfore sen it is at yi pleseir to distribute al officis and
auctoriteis wtin ye realm. You man respo^d for ye crimis and iniqui^eis done be
thy secua^dis aganis thy leges and s^bdittes. Ye swerd is geuin to y^ not to
enriche and magnify theuis and tratouris, nor it to inuaid true and innocent
pepill, bot only to punis gilty and mischeuous li^mares. It war bett yi pepil
to be deid (as ye common voce ^s) tha^ to leif in sic daily trubyll as yai leif
be iniure of yame yt should be yair defendoures. Heirfore we exhort yt to remove
al yir unhappy tyra^nys thy cou^salouris, and to govern ye realm and common
weill with sic felicite as thy eldares hes done before, for we think it vnganand
sa lang as we are on live (gif you will be rewlit be ws) yt thy subdittis should be
oppressed other in time of weir or peace, sen we have been euir reddy to defend
yt with our bodyis and gudis bot any regard to our lyuis, and yairfor schaw thy
self ane just prince. and cast yt to be luffit with yame quho^ you desiris to be
yi freindis. and understand y^ ane just king makis his cietezanis obeisant but
any rebellion or debait. Quhe^ king Gryme had answerit with dissimi^it and feneit
wordis to yir ambassatouris, he callit yam to ane ba^ket with purpos to have
put yame in prison, nochtheles yai war aduertist yairof and fled with swift horse
to Bertha, quhare ye remanent noblis war asse^blit for ye time. King Gryme not
mouit be their wordis, bot traisting ilk thing to succeid with sic felicite (as
before) gaif him to his lust and insolence, not ceissyng fra frequent exactionis
and scurge of his legis. Quhil at last he was aduertist yt his noblis war
rebellit aganes him. and incontinent he rasit his baner and come with great
nowmer of pepil to inuaid yame y^ war repugnant to him. Yan followit mair
trubyll than euir was seen i^ Albion, for ye castelles war cassin down, ye
townis brint, ye cornis distroyit, and ye pepyl slane in kirkis at yair
devotion. Sic cruelteis and trubil causit Malcolme prince of Cu^bir to cu^ out
of England fra ye weres of danis in scotland. At his cumyng al pepyll specially
ye hatit Grime come to him to be releiffit of ye cruel tyra^nijs done to thaym,
and said he was not borne only for the weil of him self, bot sum part for the
weil of his freindes and cuntre, and discendit of nobyl blude, hauand riches
and manheid to support his cuntre quhen time occurrit. and to deliver thaym of
ye odius tyrant Gryme, quhilk ^eand done all thing mycht succeed to him as he
plesit. Malcolme mouit be their persuasionis come with great nowmer of pepyll
aganis king Gryme. Als sone as Gryme was aduertist thairof, he gaderit all the
folkis that he mycht get for the time. Fynaly both the armyis set down their
tentis fornens other at the town of Auchnabart on ye ascension day. King grime
traisli^g that Malcolme mycht be esaly vincust, as he yat was geuin mair to
devotion tha^ any cheualry be sole^pnite of ye day, come forthwart with all his
power in the brek of ye day. nochtheles Malcolme was weil informit of his
purpos. And after that he had requestit him (howbeit it was i^ vane) to desist
fra battall be reverence of ye blissi^ day, both the armyis ruschi^ togidder.
At ye first meting was great slaucht, bot at last king Grimis army was vincust
and put to flycht. It is said yt king Grime was taken fechta^d with great
ferocite and manheid, and after that he was strikin with money bludy wou^dis in
his heid, both his eyes war put out. And quhen he had leiffit certane dayis on
this wise in mesirie and dolor, he deceissit ye.ix. eir of his regne and was
buryit in Colmekyl. fra ye incarnation.i.M.x. eris.

Of king Malcolme ye secou^d. How Sueno king of Norrovvay with doubil victory
chasit king Eldred of Ingland in Normandy and oppressed Inglismen with great
cruelteis. Ca. xiiii.
MAlcolme after yis victory callit sindry of his noblis (quhilkis war takin
prisoneris at yis time) to his p^se^ce, and eft yt he had tretit yam with great
humanite, he schew to yame yat he was just heretour to ye croun of scotland,
and faucht not aganis the weil yairof, bot allanerly to releif ye pepil of ye
tyranny of Gryme. Ye.xv. day after, ane conuention was maid at Scone quhare al
ye nobilite of scotland beand p^sent, Malcolme declarit yt he wald not ressaue
ye croun of scotland, quhil ye lawis maid before be hes fad ke^neth war
approbat, and ye noblis sworn neuir to cu^ in ye contrar yairof. sic thingis
beand gra^tir, Malcolme was crownit in ye fatal chiar of marbil and maid sic
concord with his noblis, yt al occasion of hatre^t and sedition was set aside.
Eft his coronatio^ he dealt hes offices concerning civil actio^is to yan^ ye war
may resoluit i^ ye lawis* other offices pertening to cheualry war geuin to
may vailea^t capitanes, throw quhilk followit bett justice tha^ was seen money
eres afor. Quhil ye empire of scottis was gouernit i^ yis manner, Sueno king of
danis ariuit i^ britane with great navy to revenge ye iniu^is done before be
Inglisme^. Yis Sueno after his coronation (as is writtin in ye history of
danis) wrocht sic punitio^ and cruelte on cristin pepyll, yt his subdittes war
co^stranit to renu^ce ye cristin faith, and returnit to yair auld
superstit^onis. nochtheles his cruelte was not lang vnpunist. for he was eft be
just punition of god thris taken prison^^ with his ennymes, and thris ransonit
with infinite money, and finaly brokin with sa frequent incursionis, that he
was doung out of his realm be Alanus king of Norroway. Als sone as Sueno was
banist in this wise, he come to the scottis desyring support to recover his
realm. The Scottis hauand compassion of his calamite, brocht him first to the
sacrament of baptism. and finaly supportit him in sic manner, that he was
r^storit to his kingdom. Sueno sone after yt he was restorit to his realm
come with ane army of Danis, Norowanis, Suessis, Gothis, Uandalis, and Frisonis
in Ingland, and chasit king Eldrede in Northumbirland. This Eldrede be band of
confid^ratioun drew the scottis to his support, and tuk purpos with new curage
to assail the chance of fortoun aganis the danis. Proceeding heirfore straucht
aganis his ennymes, he set down his ten^is not far fra ork upon the river of
Owse. In ye mean time Sueno hauand na memory of the great humaniteis done to him
be scottis, chargit yame to return hame, and leif ye opinion of Inglisme^.
Uth^rwayis he wald invade yame be battal. King Eldrede tuk the herald (quhilk
come to this effect) and kest him i^ ^etteris. king Sueno went haistely
forthwart with weil arrayit battall. Incontinent both the armyis iunit sa
haistely, yt nane of yame had power to schote their dartis. Ye battal was la^g
fochtin with vncertane victory, quhil at last the Inglismen war put to flycht.
King Eldrede after this discomfitour fled ouir ye river of Owse in ane bait,
the resydew of his army war other taken or slane. Eldrede seeing ylk day mair
trubyll r^syng in his realm and disparit of releif* fled in Normandy, quhare
he was sa tenderly ressauit be R^chard d^k yairof, yt he marijt his douchter
Emma, and ga^ on her two sonnis Alarud and Edward. He had als ane other son
namit Edmond ane man of hie curage and strenth of body. Yis Edmond was gottin
be Eldrede on his first wife before the Danis inuadit his realm and was callit
Irneside (because he was exercit in cheualry) and rang.xvi. eris above Inglismen
as we sal after schaw. Sueno proud of their feliciteis tuk auisement with the
remanent Danis, how ye Inglismen mycht be may esaly distroyit, that he micht
stabyll the realm to him and his posterite but any impediment of Inglismen in
times cumy^g. The nobillis of Ingland aduertist of yis extreme hatrent of Danys
aganis yame fell on kneis before Sueno, exhorti^g him to have mercy on yame, sen
they war ane anciant pepyl sum time may pissant both be see and land. and
prayit him to suffir yame remane on live under quhat servitude he pleasit. For
they desirit na castellis, townis, nor riches, bot only to leif with their
wiffis and children under servitude. Howbeit Sueno was be nature may cruel,
it he vsit his victory with les indignation on Inglismen than he purposit. And
co^mandit yame money eris eft to beir na wappinnis, bot to use husbandry or
other labouris under servitude of Danis, honoryng him as their just prince. And
in the mean time he commandit yame to bring al their gold, silver, Iowellis,
wappinnis, and armor to him aganes ane prefixit day. And to rander their
townis, castellis, and munitionis to him yat they mycht be keipit in times
cumyng be Danis. gif any of the Danis war repugnant to yir materis, to be
punist to the deith, The Inglismen war finaly sa brokin with ylk trubil ^ising
above other, that they fulfyllit their chargis in all pointis. Thus was ye croun
of Ingland conquest be danis. Eftir ye first conques maid on it be saxonis Fra
the time of Uortigern v.C.xxix. eris. Sueno rang eft this with great tyranny
above Inglisme^. And reft fra thaym yair liberte in sic manner, that he wald
suffer nane of yair blude beir auctorite nor honouris within Ingland. The
preistis and prelatis nocht only were degradit of yair benefices, bot cassin in
presoun, and danis put in yair roumes. The Inglismen oppressed with sic miserabil
calamiteis, began to lament yair unhappy chance, wareand yame self that they
chesit not erar to have deit quhen they mycht, than to leif with sic daily
oppressioun be tyranny of unmercifully ennymes. it Sueno was na thing mouit with
yair lamentable regrait. Bot thirllit thaym the more they lamentit, to new and
importable servitude. For the ingyne of tyrannis is ay of sic condition, ye
more they se their subdittis and liegis deieckit in supreme misery and truble,
ye more their unmercifully tyranny ragis on thaym with new iniure. Finalie ye
Inglisme^ were brocht to so great calamite and misery be Danis, yat ilk house in
Ingland was constranit to sustene ane Dane, yt ye samyn mycht be ane spy to ye
king. And aduertis him quhat was done or said in that house. Be quhilk way ye
king mycht know sone quhare any rebellion was aganis him. Yis spy was callit
lord Dane. Quhilk is now taken for ane ydyll lymmer that seikis his leuyng on

How Olauus and Onetus come in scotland with great army of Danis. and hov^
king Malcolme was dyscomfist. Ca. xv*
INglismen oppressed in this manner and spuleit of their croun and riches, Sueno
(to stable hes realm) thocht expedient to tak peace with his nychtbouris, the
Normannis, Britonis, and Scottis under yir conditionis, that nane of tham
support Inglismen aganis Danis. And above yir co^ditionis, he send his herald
to ye Norma^nis, chargeand thaym to send king Eldred with his two sonnis to him
in Ingland, or else to distroy yame, yt na succession of yam sal remane on
life to be impediment to him or his ayris in times cu^ing. And because nane of
their co^ditionis were obseruit, He garnist al ye strenthis of his realm fo^nens
Normandy with strange munition and vittallis. And maid his provision to inuaid
ye scottis, and to ye fine he mycht bring his purpos more esaly to effect, he
co^mandit Olauus and Onetus his lieutenantis to cu^ haistely in Scotland with
all ye pepil yt they mycht get to inuaid ye scottis. Sone eftir yir forsaid
capitanis arriuit with ane great army in ye mouth of Spayand ia^dit with sic
awful ordinance* that ye inhabitantis fled with their bestiall, wiffis, and
children to yair best refuge. The danis eft yair cumyng, brint ye kirkis,
templis, and townis in Murray. and slew al personis quhom they micht apprehend,
and tuk al ye strenthis of Murray except three castellis allanerlie. yat is to
say, Elgen Fores, and Narne. At last ye danis laid ane sege to the castle of
Narne, and traistit (quhen it was taken perforce) the tothir two castellis to be
randrit but any straik. In ye mean time their danis were aduertist. yat king
Malcolme was cumand forthwart with all ye army of Scotland to gif yame battall.
And incontinent yai left the sege of ye castle, and went with na les curage
aganis ye scottis, than victory had been present in their handis. Sone eftir
come ambassatouris of Malcolme to their danis, inquiryng quhy yai inuadit his
landis but any occasioun* skarslie had yir ambassatouris done yair message,
quhen yai were slane ^e cruelte of danis. King Malcolme mouit with this cruelte
and co^plenyng ye law of pepill br^kin be slaucht of his ambassatouris, corn
that same nycht with great mala^colie ^o ane meadow beside Killos. Great ^^yis and
clamor was all ye nycht amang his army desyring battal to revenge the
cruelteis done be danis. Nochtheles fra yai saw ye danis on the morrow with more
noumer of pepill and better ordour yan yai had seen before, they began to decay
of yair curage, and tuk more solicitude to saif their liuis yan to inuaid yair
ennymes. Malcolme seeing yame astonist ^red, gif he desyrit thaym to fecht yt
they should other fle, or ellis be repugnant to his charges. And yairfore eid to
ane mote quhare he callit his nobillis to ane cou^sall, and detesti^ yair
cowartdris, they beand sa vaileand at hame, quhen na danger occurrit. And at ye
first sycht of yair ennymes astonist. Quha^ thing (said he) hes mouit ow my
good freindis to pas sa suddanlie fra the office of vaileant campionis?
deuoidyng our anciant fortitude but any experience of battal. For gif e dreid
yir bludy and furius pepil, and ar disparit to have victory be our manheid and
curage. Yan ar e nocht worthy to be so^nis of tha vaileant campionis ye vincust
yir danis at Loncarte be cheualry of Kenneth my fader. We find great multitude
of danis vincust in Albion to ye interminable glore of our eldares. Quhat

infinite noumer of thaym ar buryit in Albion, that it may be callit justly the
sepulture of danis. Su^ of yame ar slane in our days, othires in our eldaris.
Bot yir danis (yat ar now to fecht aganis ow) ar nocht of sic manheid and

furiously met yame in arrayit battall. Followit sone ane trible battall

How the castle of Name was taken and the soudiouris thairof treasonably
slane be danis. And how ye danis war discomfist at Murthlak. Ca. xvi.
THe danis after this victory think and not proffytabyll to leif Murray quhyll
it war pecifijt to yair dominion, gaderit the spuleis of the field, and
returnit to sege the castle of Narne with mair pissance tha^ before. Yis castle
stude ye time al within the sea beildit with strange touris and wallis with na
les crafty tha^ curious lauboure. Ane strait passage was to it maid be ingyne of
man in manner of ane brig. Throw quhilk men micht pas out of ye samyn to land.
Ye soudiouris (quhilkes war left in ye said castle) heirand how king Malcolm
was disco^fist, randerit ye castle in ye handis of danis under this condition.
Yai sal leif their armor and wappinnis behind yame and depart, yair life and
remanent gudis laif. Notwithstanding ye danis co^trar yair faith and promis
hangit treasonably al personis (quho^ yai ^and) within ye said castle. Thus was
Narne ye strangest castle of Murray taken be ye danis, and sa garnist be yair
industry yt it semit vnwi^nabyl. Ye soudiouris in Elgyn and Fores, heirand yis
treason done be danis, left the castellis desert, and fled to king Malcolme. Ye
danis reiosyng of their feliciteis and traisting to have sicker dwelling in
Murray, send for yair wiffis and children in Norroway and Denmark to cum
haistely in scotland. And in the mean time yai scurgit sindry of ye scotts sic
as war waik and fehyl bodyis, and constranit yame to scheir their corn. King
Malcolme dredand the danis, be new cumyng of pepyll to be mair pissant, come in
beginning of the nixt symer with great multitud of pepil to Mur^hlak ane town
of Mar, quhare the first foundament was of the kirk of Abirden, and was nocht
far yat time fra ye sicht of danis, quhe^ sudda^ly both ye armyis war astonist
be sicht of other. Ye scottis hauand experience of ye cruelte done before be
danis war affrayit. and ye danis on ye same manner. for yai war seuerit fra yair
schippes, and because yai knew no^ ye ground they dred mair yt hid waching, tha^
ye opin violence of yair e^nymes. At last both ye armyis be hortatio^ of yair
capitanis iunit with birna^d hatrent on al sydis. In the first bront three
vaileant campionis Kenneth of Ilis, Gryme of Strathern and Patrik Du^bar of yat
ylk ruschand ou^^ feirsly on yair ennymes war slane, and gaif occasion to
sindry scottis to fle. And it ye place (quhare yai fled) was sa strait, yat na
pepyl mycht fle esaly throw ye samyn. And yocht malcolme withstud his ennymes
in perseuerant ma^heid. it he was dreuyn abak as he had been fleand. And ye
place (quhare he faucht) semit ay mait strait and difficil throw syndry fowleis
of watter and fail, quhilk was maid before for nichtbore weir. Attoure money
treis war hewin down liand thortwart ye land and stoppi^ both the entres and
out passage of this gait. In myddis of quhilk was ane chapel dedicat in ye
honor of sa^ct Molok. Malcolme dreuin on this manner abak, rasit his ha^dis to
the heuyn and said. Great god of virtew, rewardar of piete, and punisar of
sin, we thy crist^n pepyl defendoures of our native rowmes gra^tit be thy
beniuol^nce (quhilkis ar now na^it of mortal help and inuadit be treasobil
iniure of danis) recurris to the in this our extreme necessyte, praying the to
have compassion on our miserable chance. Remove O mercyful lord yis schameful
te^rour fra our pepil. And O thou modir of god ye sicker refuge of mortal
pepil in yair distres. and O thou sanct Molok (to quhom yis chapel is dedicat)

memorial, yat our realm was saiffit be our support. Skarslie was this orison
endit be Malcolme, Quhen ane part of ye noblis said, O co^paneonis* god will yt
we return and renew battall on our ennymes. The s^ry and noyis of ye army be
yir wourdis raise with curage ay more incressing. sayand schaw now pertlie our
visage. Debait our land and liuis, quhilkis ar may deir to every creature i^
erd. Incontinent al ye scottis return^t as it had been be miracle, and maid
incredible slaucht on yair ennymes but on^ sycht to yair liuis or bleida^d
won^^s. In ye mean time king Malcolm come with ane buschement upon One (...),
quhilkis was yan pra^sand throw ye field (as he had been sicker of victo^y)
with heid nakit of heumond. and finalie he straik Onetus fra his horse amang the
futmen, quhare he was slane. Ye residew of danis seand yair capitane slane
ceissit fra any for their persecutioun on ye scottis. Yus succedit great blithnes
to scottis. and e^treme desolatioun to danis. And it the battall continewit
lang on a^hir side, quhil at last ye danis were put to flycht, and money of yame
slane and few taken. Olauus heirand his colle^g slane, fled with ane few cumpany
of danis in Murray. King Malcolme knawing ye may vaileant campionis of his
army slane, ceissit fra any forthir persute of danis, and deu^dit the spuleis
of the field amang his men. Syne went in Angus, quhare he remanit the residew
of that eir takand co^sultation of sic materis as pertenit to the common weil
and recoueryng of Murray fra danys.

How Camus prince of Norrovvay cumand with ane store of Dani^ in Angus was
slane, and his army discomfist be king Malcolme at Bar, and how the surname
of Keithis tuke their beginning. Ca. xvii.
SUeno king of Danis and Inglismen heirand how unhappily ye danys faucht at
Murthlak, yat yis present aduersite should nocht deiect ye glore of Danys nor make
ye name of scottis ouir glorius, deuisit two nauyis with great noumer of Danis
to cum in Scotland. The first was deuisit to cum forth of Thamys in Ingland.
And in this other to cum out of Denmark with ane vaileant knycht namit Camus to
be admiral of both the flotis. The nixt eir Camus come with yis navy i^ ye
mouth of Forth beside sanct Eb. Quhare he was stoppit money dayis to land. At
last be prosper wyndis he pullit up salis, and arriuit at the reid bra^s in
Angus, and landit his men or the cu^tre mycht be gaderit to resist him. Camus
eftir yat he was la^dit in yis manner, went to ye nixt mote, and reiosit that he
was landit in the place quhare danis had wrocht before sindry iniuris, and
cassyn down ye town of Montros. and tra^stit thairfore the more felicite to
succeid in his remanent viage. Sone eftir he rasi^ his camp and went throw
Angus ceissing fra na manner of cruelte ye micht be deuisit and kest down
kirkis, templis, cieteis and townis but any miseratioun quhare he come. Sic
thingis done, he went to Brechin, quhare sum time was ane strange castle with
ane kirk dedicat in the honor of the Trinite. And because the castle micht not
be haistely taken, yai enterit both in ye town and kirk with sic cruelte yt
they left not ane stane thairof vncassin down. Camus rageand with yir and siclik
cruelteis both aganis god and man was finaly aduertist, yt Malcolme was cu^ to
Dunde with all ye power of scotland. And incontinent he fled to ye see not far
fra Balbrid, quhare he vsit na les cruelte than before on ye pepyll. King
Malcolme desyring to deliver his realm fra tyranny of danis, come with arrayit
oist to ye town of Bar two mylis fra Balbrid and tuk little rest ye nicht.
For his army was to fecht on ye morrow for defense of their realm and liberte.
On the morrow he callit hes noblis to his standert, and prayit yam to consider
how they war to fecht aganis ane pepyll blyndit with avarice, not seikand their
leuing be just battal bot only be reif and pykery, and not only ennymes to
cristin faith, bot inuading i^nocent pepyl but any occasion of battall, and set
to distroy ye true faith in Albion. Als to remembir how they war only
defendouris of their own realm, and ordanit be god to punis ye cruelte of
danis, and yairfore prayit thaym to pas forthwart with sic manheid and curage,
yat yai may other de honorably, or ellis have victory may vaileantly. On ye
tothir side Camus exhortit ye danis to battal with sicker hope of victory, and
to remembir yai behuiffit outhir to de miserably in ane uncouth realm, or
ellis to have victory with immortal honor. Sone eft Malcolme come with
arrayit battal aganis ye danis with ye mair audacite and curage, yt he had
before experience of yair cruelte. For ye ingyne of nobyll men ar of sic
faculte, y^ mair yai have experience in honest materes, the mair risis their
curage to do su^ notabyll vassalage. Ye two armyis birna^d in athir hatrent,
ruschit finaly togidd with may cruelte. Throw quhilk followit sic slauchter, yt
ye burn of lochte ran with bludy stremis to ye almane seys, and it nane of yame
semit to geif place to other. Sindry war seen yat day strikin throw ye body and

yai seuerit not quhil yai deceissit both togidder. Throw quhilk apperit yai
faucht with na les Ire than good will. quhil at last ye danis war vincust, and
Camus chasit to ye montanis. The scottis followit on him with sic fury, yt he was
finaly slane. In sign heirof ye place (quhare he was slane) is callit it
Camustane. The principal slaar of these Camus was ane oung man namit Keith,
quhilk for his singular vassalage prouyn in yis field gat certane landis in
Louthiane callit Keith. Quhais house is now decorit with great honor, and
callit Marschelles of scotland. Of quhom ar discendit money nobyl and vaileant

foundit ane eirly leuing to sustene ye same, with money other notabil dedis
quhilkes war ouir prolixit to schaw at these time. Bot we will return to our
history. King Malcolme after sa money cruel battallis led aganis the Danis
gouernit the realm money eris in good Justice, and maid ane buke callit Regiam

co^moditeis ^al^e geuyn in feis to his chancellar. Secretar, Constabyll,
Marschell, Chalmerlane, Justice, Thesaurer, Register, Comptrolla^, and other

other prince that euir was in this realm. Gif sic vir^ew had been i^ his
lat^er age as was in his first outh or ma^nis age* nochtheles all his excellent
glore was full ^eit with immoderate avarice. For (as oftymes occurris) he come
both at anis to eild and avarice, and was penitent of the landis geuyn be his
liberalite to his nobillis. And to recover the said landis he slew and banist
money of his lordis be van^ and feneit c^usis. The noblis mouit be their iniuris
and hauand gre^ indignation, that the king nocht only put handis in their bl^d,
^ot was set to conques yair landis and rowmes be feneit causis conspirit aganis

co^spiration to saif his life fled with certane his familiaris to Gla^mis,
quhare he was slane be freindes of the nobillis quhilkis war slane before be

ouircouerit with snaw, that they mycht not know the gait. Fynaly they come to ye
loch of Forfare, quhilk was sum part frosin for ye time. Als sone as they war

in yat manner. Nocht lang after they war drawin out of the loch with creparis,
and yair quarteris houng up in sindry townis of Scotland in punition of their

incarnation ane.M.xl. eris. And was buryit in Colmekyll. In this time money
meruellis was seen in Albion. On ule day the erd trimblit, and ane great rift

Heir begynnis the twelf Buke of the croniklis of Scotland:
Of king Duncane. How the surname of Stevvartis tuk yair first beginning. And
how Makbeth punist sindry enormyteis done in king Duncani^ time. Ca. primo.
MAlcolme slane as we have schawin, succedit his nepot Duncane gottyn on his
douchter. For Malcolm had two douchteris, of quhilkis the eldest namyt Beatrice
was geuyn in marriage to Abbanath crynin, quhilk was thane of the Ilis and west
partis of scotland. On her was gottin Duncane quhilk succedit immediately eft
him to ye croun. Ye secound douchter namit Doada, was geuin in marriage to Synel
thane of Gla^mis, on quhome was gottin ane feirs and vaileant man namyt Makbeth
rycht ganand to have gouernit any realm, were nocht his strenth was geuin oui^
mekil to cruelte. Yocht Du^cane and Makbeth were sister sonnis, yai were (...)
different fra other i^ maneris. For Duncane was sa merciful, yat he apperit
nocht abill to punys the vices of his pepill. Be contrar Makbeth was geuin als
mekill to cruelte as Du^cane was geuin to piete. And yairfore ye people desyrit
yair maneres to have been tempora^ with otheris. Duncane in the beginning of
his empire gouern^t the realm in good peace and Justice. For it was gouernit be
the same counsalouris yat gouernit it during his faderis time. Thus leuit the
co^monis money eris but any iniure or oppression of great men. it the feeble mind
of Du^cane (quhen it was patent to ye pepil) was not only cause of great
seditionis ama^g the noblis. Bot occasion to Danis to attempt new weris aganis
ye scottis. The cause of their seditionis raise be ye thane of Lochquhabir namit
Banquho, quhilk was ye beginnar of ye noble surname of Stewartis in this
realm. Of quhome our king now p^sent he lang progression is discendit. Quhen
this Banquho had gaderit all the kingis rentis, he punist sindry lymmaris of ye
cuntre with sic extreme rigor of Justice, yt the pepil raise aganis him with
great power, and spuleit him of all ye money quhilk he had gaderit before to ye
kyngis use. And youcht he eschapit with his life, it he was evil wou^dit. At
last quhen he was curit of all his woundis, he come to the king desyring the
iniuris and contemptioun done to him to be punist. King Du^cane to dant their
attemptatis send ane officer of Arms, and su^mond all personis (that were
suspect in this matter) to underly ye law agane ane certane day. Their lymmaris
yat did this cruelte heirand thaym su^mond* for more contemption slew ye
officer. And because ye kingis power was to cu^ on yame to punis yair offense,
yai maid Makdowald yair capitane. and he glaidlie tuk the charge of battall on
him, knawing the king soft. and (as he alliegit) more abill to govern ane
abbay of monkis than to gyde any band of weirmen. Yis Makdowald gaderit ane
cu^pany of mischeuous lymmaris out of Ireland, Ilis, and other regionis yair
about. And slew Malcolme lieutenand to Duncane in Lochquhabir, and put his men
to flycht. King Duncane astonist be slaucht of his men (for he was nocht
exercit in weris nor it knew how sic thingis mycht be dressit) co^uenit his
noblis to ane cou^sal to tak punition on their attemptatis. Eftir sindry
opinionis Makbeth repreuit king Du^cane of his soft governance, hauand na
ingyne to punis iniuris ^one to his pepill. And schew gif ye landis of
Lochquhabir were geuin to him and banquho* yai should leif nane of Makdowaldis
blude on live. And as he promittit, sa followit. For sone eftir his cu^ing in
Lochquhabir, the pepil heirand ye fame of hes vassalage durst nocht attempt sic
thingis as yai did before* and money of yame lef^ makedowald and come to Makbeth.
All wayis Makdowald was sa inuadit, that it was necessar to him to gif battal
to Makbeth. Nochtheles he was discomfist and chasie to ane castle in
Lochquhabir. Makbeth followit on him to ye said castle and be lang sege brocht
him to sic misery, yat he was co^stranit to ask grace to him self his wife and
barnis. And because he gat nocht bot repuls yairof, he slew first his wife and
barnys, yt yai should not remane in decisioun to his ennymes. Syne slew him self
on ye same manner. Makbeth enterit in ye castle and youcht he fand makdowald
slane, it he schure of his heid and send it to the castle of Bertha, quhair ye
king was, and gart hyng his body on ane hi^tre. The Ilis men maid yair
compositionis with great soumes of money. Otheris of thaym were punist to the
deith. Ye remanent pepill of ye Ilis mouit be the slaucht of yair (...) gaif
displesa^d wourdis to Makbeth calla^d him ane bludy monstour but any mercy.
makbeth inco^tin^^ maid his ordinance to pas in the Ilis to punis thaym for
yair vnbridlit language. Nochtheles be solistation of their freindis he ceissit
and tuke recompensatioun of their guddis.

Sueno king of Danis was arriuit in scotland with ane army, and to schaw of
quhat lynnage this Sueno was descendit, we will repeit sum part his original.
Sueno the first king of danis yt rang above Inglismen had three sonnis. Herald,
Sueno, and Canute. The first was maid king of Ingland. The secund king of
Norway. And ye third king of Denmark. The first was slane be Eldred after yt he
was exilit be Sueno in Normandy ye third eir eft his faderis deith. And it
Eldrede reiosit nocht lang ye croun of Ingland. For Canute king of danis come
with ane army in England to revenge ye slauchter of his eldest bruther Herald,
and slew the said Eldrede. Eftir quhais deith his son Edmound Irneside come
with ane army aganis Canu^ with purpos both to revenge ye slauchter of his
fader, and to recover the croun. At last quhen ye battallis were arrayit i^
otheris sicht reddy to fecht. This Edmond (...) before his army desiring to

Canute said. O Edmond quhilk hes now sickir experience of my feirs and awful

vncertane chance of battall. Traisting sum time to fy^d occasioun to recover ye
hail empire of Ingland with litill laubour. Incontinent they demontit of their
^oursouris, and embrasit other with ^aist tenderness. Yus was ye realm ^
Ingland deuidit betuix yame in yis manner. The part of Ingland fornence France
was assignit to Canute. And the tothir part to Edmond. In the mean time Enna
queen of Ingland dredand this concord na thing profitable to hi^, fled in
Normandy with her two sonnis Alarude and Edward, quhilkes scho bure to ye said
Eldrede. Bot we will return to our history. Quhen Sueno king of Norroway saw
his brothir eik to his empire of Denmark the half of Ingland, he tuke desire to
be equale to his brothir, als weil in rentis, as in marcial glore. And to bring
his purpos to effect, he come with ane army in Fisse. The motive of his cumyng
was to revenge the slauchter of his eme Camus and other danis slane with him at
Bar Crowdane and Ge^mere. And youcht Sueno was cumyn (as said is) to conques
fame and honor, it be was na thing co^parit to his brothir Canut. For he slew
innocent barnis women and agit personis but any difference of their estait.
King Duncan^ heirand yir importable and schameful cruelteis done to his pepil,
began to be ane prudent capitane. For oftymes dull and sleuthfull pepil ar
constranyt be necessite to becum prudent and virtuous. King Du^cane heirand how
Sueno was cumyng in manner forsaid to inuaid his realm, assemblit ane army of
all pepill under his empire, and deuidit thaym in three battallis. The first
battal was geuin to Makbeth. Ye secound to Banquho* And he abaid him self in ye
myddilward with the remanent nobillis of scotland. Syne met his ennymes at
Culros, quhare both ye armyis faucht with great cruelte. Bot the scottis war
finaly discomfist. it the danis war sa brokin be this battall, yt they maid not
lang chase, bot stude al nicht in arrayit battal. On the morrow quhen they saw
ye field discomfist and na ennymes appear, they pertit ye s^uleis be rite of
arms, and inhibit to sl^nakit men. Traisting to conques ye realm with favor and
beniuolence of ye pepyl. Sic thingis done, Sueno rasit his tents to follow on
ye remane^t scotts. And because he was aduertist, yt king Du^cane was fled to
ye castle of Bertha, and makbeth gaderyng ane new army to resist hes
incursionis, he laid ane strait sege about ye said castle. Als sone as king
Duncane saw him self beltit on ylk side with ennymes, he send ane officer be
counsal of Banquho to Makbeth, commanding him abide at Inchecuthill quhill he
send him other word. In the mean time he send ane herald to Sueno desiring
license to him self and ^he noblis yt was within ye castle to depart yair life
and guddis saif. Yis was desirit be Duncane, howbeit he knew na thing better
tha^ repuls yairof, y^ hes ennymes micht have na other suspicion. Bot ye castle
was to be randerit but any mair delay. At last quhe^ Sueno had desirit ye
castle to be ra^decit* king Du^cane to intertene him quhil all materis war
brocht to good purpos, promittit to send an^ large provision of vittallis out of
ye castle to refresche his army. Yir offeres war not only plesand to Sueno,
bot als to his army. For they had been money days before but any fresche
vittallis in great penurite. Incontinet the scotts tuk ye ius of mekilwort
herijs, and mengit it in yair wine aill and breid, and send ye samyn in great
quantite to yair ennymes. Sueno and his army reio^ing of yis fouth of vi^tallis
began to waucht on yair manner. and to have experience quha micht ingorge yair
wambe with may voracite* quhil at last ye ve^noun of yir beryis was skalit
throw all partis of their bo^yis. Throw quhilk they war resoluit in ane deidly
sleip. Yan Duncane send to Makbeth commanding him to inuaid his ennymes with all
diligence, for they war at ane esy point to be v^cust. Makbeth but mair tarry
com with his folkis to the tentis of ennymes. And first he slew their wache,
and ye remanent of yame sowpit with sleip war al murdrest i^ yair beddis. Sueno
was brocht with few nowmer of his folkis to the schippis, qu^are he pullit up
sales and returnit i^ Norroway. Of all this army eschapit nane bot Sueno and.x.
personis with him by ye marineris. Money eres eft na knichtes war maid in
Norroway, quhill they war sworn to revenge ye slaucht of yair freindis i^
scotland. Ye remane^t schippis (quhilkis war left behind ye danis in ye scottis
firth) within three dayis eft their departing raschit ilk ane on other be
violence of ane Eist wind, and sank down in ye firth, quhare they ly it to ye
great dangeir of all other schippis yt cumis i^ ye samyn. for quhen ye see
flowis, they ar couerit with watter. and quhen it ebbis, yai appeir su^ part
above ye samyn callit it be ye pepil Dru^law sandis, Ye scotts after yis
victory gat ye spuleis of ye field, and maid general processio^s throw al
pertis of yair realm, geuand tha^kis to god for ye felicite falling to yame.
Quhil ye scottis war at yair* processionis in yis wise, tithingis come y^ ane
new flote of Danis war artiuit at King orne, and ye weirmen cumyng on land
inuading ye cuntre with may cruelteis. to dant yir atte^pta^is were send with
ye kingis auctoryte Makbeth and Banquho, quhilkis slew ane gre^ part of yir
danis* and the remane^t chasit to their schippis. Their danis that fled to their
schippis gaif great so^^es of gold to Makbeth to suffer their freindis (that war
slane at hi^ ieoperd) to be buryit in sanct Colmes Inche. In memory heirof money
auld sepulturis at it in the said Inche, grauyn with armis o^ danes. At last
peace was ratifiit betuix scottis and danis i^ this manner. The danis sal never
cu^ in scotland to move any weir aganis ye scottis. Their war ye weris of king
Duncane led aganis the danis the.vii. eir of his regne.

Of the vveirdis geuyn to Makbeth and Banquho. How Makbeith was maid Thane of
Cavvder. And how he slew king Duncane to make him self king. Ca. iii.
NOcht lang eftir hapnit ane uncouth and wounderfull thing. Be quhilk followit
sone ane great alteration in ye realm. Be adventure Makbeth and Banquho were
passand to Fores, quhair king Duncane hapnit to be for ye time, and met be ye
gait three women clothit iuelrage and uncouth weid. they were Iugit be the pepill
to be weird sisteris. The first of thaim said to Makbeth Hale thane of Gla^mis.
The secound said, hale thane of Cawder, And the third said, hale king of
scotland. yan said Banquho, quhat women be e sa unmercifully to me, and sa
fauorabil to my companeon. For e gaif to him nocht only landis and great rentis
bot great lordschippis and kingdoms, and geuys me nocht. To this answerit the
first of their weird sisteris. We schaw more felicite apperyng to the, than to
him. For youcht he happyn to be ane king, his empire sall end vnhappelie, and
nane of his blude sall eftir him succeid. Be co^trar you sall neuir be king.
Bot of ye sal cum money kingis, quhilkis with la^g progressioun sall reiose ye
croun of scotland. Als sone as their wourdis were said, they suddanlie euanist
out of sycht. This prophecy and diuinatioun was haldin money dayis in derision
to Banquho and Makbeth. For sum time Banquho wald call Makbeth king of scottis
for derisioun. And he on the samyn manner wald call Banquho ye fader of money
kings. it because al thyngis succedit as their women deuinit. The pepill
traistit and Iugit yame to be weird sisteris, not lang eft it hapnit yt ye
thane of Cawder was disherist and forfaltit of his la^dis, for certane crimes
of lose majesty, and his landis were geuyn be king Duncane to Makbeth. It hapnit
in the nixt nicht yt Banquho and Makbeth were sportand to g^ddir at their
supper. Yan said Banquho, thou hes gottin all yt ye first two weird sisteres
hecht. Restis nocht bot ye croun, quhuilk was hecht be ye third sist. makbeth
reuoluyng all thingis (as they were said be their weird sisteris) began to couat
ye croun. And it he co^cludit to abide quhil he saw y^ time gana^d yairto.
Fermelie beleuyng yt ye third weird should cum as ye first two did before. In the
mean time king Duncane maid his son Malcolme prince of Cu^bir to signify, yt he
should regne eftir him, quhilk was great displeseir to Makbeth. For it maid plane
derogatioun to the third weird promit^it before to him be their weird sisteris.
Nochtheles he thocht (gif Duncane were slane) he had may rycht to the croun,
because he was nerest of blud yairto be tennour of of ye auld lawis maid eftir
ye deith of king Fergus, quhen oung children were vnabil to govern ye croun, the
n^rrest of yair blude sall regne. Als the respons of their weird sisteris put
him in belief, yat the third weird should cu^ als wei^^ as the first two. Attour
his wife impacient of lang tarry (as all women ar) specially quhare they ar
desirus of any purpos, gaif him great ar^ation to persew ye third weird, yat
scho micht be ane queen, calland him often tymis febyl cowart and nocht desyrus
of honouris, sen he durst not assail ye thing with ma^heid and curage quhilk is
offerit to him be beniuolence of fortoun. Howbeit sindry otheris hes assaileit
sic things before with may terribyl ieopardyis, quhen they had not sic
sickernes to succeid in ye end of their laubouris as he had. Makbeth be
persuasion of his wife gaderit his freindis to ane counsall at Innernes, quhare
king Duncane happinnit to be for ye time. And because he fand sufficient
oportunite be support of Banquho and otheris his freindis, he slew king Duncane
the vii. eir of his regne. His body was burijt in Elgyn, and after taken up and
brocht to Colmekyll, quhare it remanis it amang ye sepulturis of vthir kingis*
fra our redemption ane.M.xlvi. eris.

How Makbeth vsurpit the crown. and chasit ye sonnis of king Duncane in
Cu^bir. How he punist sindry lymmaris and maid lavvis for ye common vveil. Ca.
iiii.
ALs sone as Du^cane was slane on these manner, Makbeth come with ane great power
to Scone, and tuk the crown. Syne chasit Malcolme Ca^more and Donald bane ^he
sonnis of king Duncane in Cu^bir, quhare Malcolme reman^t continewally, quhill
sanct Edward son to king Eldred recouerit the realm of Ingland fra the danis,
and ressauit the said Malcolme in may tenderness, bot Donald went in Ireland.
Makbeth after yair departing to stabyl the realm to him with sicker firmance,
maid distribution of the kingis rentis amang the noblis, and be that way he
conquest their favor. And because he saw na man oppone thaym to him, he set
him to govern the realm in Justice, and to punis all enormeteis that fell be
febyll administration of king Duncane. it because he dred great trubyl to follow
(gif his purpos war deuulgat or it ^ome to effect) he deuisit ane subtell
slicht to bring all mysdoaris and brokin men to his Justice, and solistit
syndry his lieges with large money to appele ye theuis (quhilkes oppressed yame
may) in barras aganis ane prefixit day. And quhen their theuis war enterit in
barras (quhare yai should have fouchtin) aganis their nichtbouris, they were all
takin be armit men and hangit on Iebatis according justly to their demeritis.
The remanent mis^oaris war dantit in sic manner, yat money eris after al thift
and reiffis war dantit, and the pepyll brocht to great tranquillite* Sic thingis
done king Makbeth visyit all the bou^dis of his realm, and was haldyn the
sicker targe of Innocent pepyll, and may deligent punisar of al iniuris done
aganis the co^moun weil. And gaif his labouris to cause ou^g men incres in good
maneris, and kirk men to do their deuyne service. He slew syndry thanis of
Cath^es, Suthirland, Stranauorne, and Ros, because great trubyl raise in the realm
be their sedition. He brocht Galloway in good peace, and slew ye tyran Makgyll,
quhilk contempnit money eris before the kingis auctorite. Attour he maid lawis
for the co^moun weil, and was worthy to be nowmerit amang nobyll kingis, gif he
had succedit to the crown be just tytyll and had perseuerit in Justice to the
end of his empire. And because syndry of his lawis apperis proffitabyl. I have
colleckit thaym in this werk to make thaym the mair patent as followis. He that
is within ordouris sall not answer afor ane profane Judge, bot salbe remittit
to hes judge ordinar. The tent part of al frutis growyng on the ground sall be

He that perseueris in co^temption aganis the kirk standing cursed ane eir, and

He yt is maid knycht salbe sworn to defend wedois, co^monis, and pupyllis.
And he that is maid king sal be sworn in the samyn manner.

gif any woman mary with the lord of the ground, scho sall tyne her heritage.

Na man sall posseid landis, rentis, officis or bigingis be any other

Na office salbe heritage but during the kingis pleseir.

Na man sall sit in profane nor temporal actionis without commissioun of the

Al co^uention, office, and Justice sal be led in ye kingis name and auctorite.
He that makis band or is sworn man to any other man bot allanerly to the king,
salbe punist to the deith, and ylk man salbe bound to defend the king aganis al
other leua^d creatures. He yt raisis ye kingis liegis salbe put to deith, and
his guddis confiscat, and all the pepyll that are gaderit on that samyn manner.

He that followis ane man to the kirk or market or any other conuention, salbe

Howbeit ye son be put in fee of ye land during the life of his fader be license

the kingis majesty.

All women yt is maryit with any fre baron or lord (howbeit scho have na barnis

and it sal not be leifful to his son nor his mawchis to bruke his office. Their
and siclik lawis war vsit be king Makbeth, throw quhilk he gouernit the
realm.x. eris in good Justice. Howbeit the samyn was co^trar his natural
inclination. For he was geuyn to conques the favor of his pepyl and to
stabyll the realm to him erar than to any sycht of the co^moun weill.

How Banquho was slane be Makbeth, and his son Fleance slane in vvalis. How
Walter the son of Fleance come in scotland* And of the genology of Stevvartis.
Ca. v.
SChort time after Makbeth returnit fra al meiknes to his innatiue cruelte. for
he was led be wod furyis as ye nature of all tyra^nis is, quhilkes co^quessis
landis or kingdoms be wra^gus titil, ay full of heavy thocht and dredour. and
traisting ilk man to do siclik crueltees to him. as he did afor to other.
Forthir remembering the weirdes geui^ to hi^ (as is reherlit) y^ Ba^quhois
posterite should reiose ye crown be lang progression. He callit Banquho and his
son Flea^ce to ane supper with purpos to sla yame both. Howbeit they suspeckit
na thing les tha^ his treason. Makbeth (quhen the ba^ket was done) thocht not
expedient to sla thaym in his awin house. And thairfore to eschew al suspectioun
of crime yt micht be imput to him yairby, he laid ane band of armit men in
their gait to sla yame both ar their returnyng hame. Their men (y^ war laid in
wait to this effect) slew Banquho. Nochtheles fleance be covert of nicht
eschapit and was saiffic (as apperit) be syngular favor of god to an^ better
fortoun. Flea^ce eschaping ^yis wise* and seeing new waching laid for his
slauchter, fled in Walis* quhare he was plesandly ressauit be ye prince
^hairof, and maid sa familiar with ye princis doucht yt he maid her with ^hyld.
The prince of Walis finding his douchter deflorit persewit this ^leance with
sic hatrent that he finaly slew him, and held his douchter (...) may
schameful servitude, because scho co^sentit to her defloration with vnc^^th
blude. At last scho was deleuerit of ane son nam^t Walter, quhilk within few
eres became ane vaileant and lusty man of greter curage and spreit, than any
man that was nurist in land wart as he was. And youcht he was haldin with ye
prince of Walis his gudschir in law estait. it he had ane hye mind and abyll to
na thing mair tha^ to attempt great chargis. At last he fell at contention with
his companeoun, quhilk obiec^it to him, yt he was not gottin in lauchful bed.
After money feirs and iniurius wourdis on athir side, this Walter was sa
impacient, that he slew his companeon. Syne fled in scotland to seik support of
freindis, At his cu^myng he happynnit in cu^pany with the Inglismen (yt come in
scotland with sanct Margaret) quhare he behauit him sa plesandly in every sort,
yt he conquest yair beniuolence and favor. Nocht lang after he was send with
ane great power in ye Ilis, Galloway, and other partis of scotland to punis

How Makbeth slew his lordis for the proffet of their landis and guddis. How
he biggit the castle of Dunsynnane, and slew Makduffis wise and his barnis.
Of the orisoun maid to Malcolme Cammore be Makduf. Ca. vi.
NA thing succedit happily to Makbeth after the slauchter of Banquho* for ylk
man began to feir his life, and d^rst nocht compeir quhare Makbeth was. Thus
followit ylk day mair displeseir. For quhen this tyrane persauit ylk man hauand
him in dreid, he began to dreid ylk man in that samyn manner, and be yat way he
grew may odius to his subdittis ay slaing his noblis, or else confiscand
yair guddis be vane causis. At last quhen he had gottin great proffet be
slauchter and proscription of his noblis, he began to put his handis mair
pertly in their blud. For he thocht the proffet sa sweit yt come to him be
slaucht of his noblis, that he mycht not desist thairfra. For he had doubil
proffet be yat way. First they war slane yt he dred. And secoundly he gat their
guddis to sustene ane guard of armit me^ to defend him fra iniure of yam yt he
suspeckit. Forthir yt he micht invade ye pepyl with mair tyranny, he biggit ane
strange castle in ye hicht of Dunsynnane, ane hill in Gowry x. milis fra Perth.
Yis castle was biggit with infinite expensis. For for na stuf micht be carijt to
ye samyn but great difficulte. And it he ceissit not fra ye bigging yairof, bot
causit all the Thanis of ylk schire to big ye said castle yair course about. At
last it fell to Makduf thane of Fif to big his pert of ye said castle, And
because he durst not ca^ to yis werk, in adventure ye king put handis in him as
he did before in other noblis of ye realm, he send craftismen with all
provision, and co^ma^dit yame to do sa i^ his absence, yt ye king micht have na
occasion to be mouit aganis him. Sone after Makbeth come to vesy his castle,
and because he fand not Makduf present at the werk, he said. Yis man will not
obey my chargis, quhill he be riddin with ane mollet brydyl. Nochtheles I sall
gar him draw lik ane auir in ane ^ar^. Fra thens he mycht neuir se makduf (...)
patience, other because he thocht his power ouir great. Or ellis because it was
schawin be the prophecy of ye foresaid wichis, yat make duf should inuaid him with
disples^ir. And (as often occurris) quhare any prince takis suspitioun, ane small
offense is occasion of great iniuris. Finalie he had slane Makduf be sum slycht,
were nocht ane wiche, in quho^ he had great confidence said, To put him out of
all feir. yat he should neuir be slane with man yat was borne of wife, nor
vincust, quhill the wod of Birnane were cu^ to ye castle of Dunsynnane. Makbeth
hauand great confidence in their wourdis, set aside all feir of deith. And
traistit fermely yat he mycht do quhat he plesit but any punition eftir
following. For be y^ ta prophecy he beleuit it was impossible to vincus him.
And be ye tothir, impossible to sla him. Bot yir falls illusionis of ye devil
brocht him to vter confusion, and gart him rage in Ithand slaucht of his
subdittis but any feir of his life. At last Makduf disparit of his life, tuk
purpos to pas in Ingland, yt he mycht bring Malcolme Ca^more in scotland to
resist the tyranny of Makbeth. And it the samyn was not deuisit sa secretly,
bot Makbeth gat knawlage thairof. For all kingis (as the proverb sayis) hes
scharp sycht and lang eiris. Yis Makbeth had in every great house in scotland
part of men (quhilkis war corruppit be hes money) to reueil al thingis said or
done in their housis, and throw this slycht he oppressed all the noblis of the
realm, or they mycht fulfill yair attemptates aganis him. Yis tyrane was ay full
of solicitude, dre^dand to have ane terribil end for his cruelte. For that
cumis be impulsion of conscience, quhilk bringes every man (yt is gylty) in
perpetual solicitude, but any securite of his life. On ye samyn manner Makbeth
ever i^ feir of ennymes for his treasonabyl murdir and tyranny, come haistely
with ane great power about Makduffes house. Ye men yt was in the house trais^ing
na evil oppinnit ye e^^is. Incontinent Makbeth entrit and slew Makduffis wife
and her barnis, with all other personis yt he fand in it, syne co^fiscat
Makduffis guddis and put him to ye horn. Makduf banist in yis manner fled i^
Ingland to Malcolme Ca^more, to se gif he micht find any way at his hand to
revenge ye slauchter maid sa cruelly on hes wife and barnis. and quhe^ he was
common to Malcolme, he declarit ye great oppression done to him be Makbeth, and
how ye said tyrane was hatit with al his liegis for ye innocent slaucht both of
his noblis and co^monis, and sindry other detestabyl cruelteis not worthy to be
rehersit. At last quhen he saw malcolme sich for compassion of his sorowis, he
said. How lang sall thou suffir the murdir of thy fader and other freindis to
be vnpunist? Quhen sall thou be saciat with ye affliction of thy realm? Quhat
damage have we sufferit be thy proscription? Thou was ye time of sa tender
age, yat thou mycht not debait aganis sa bludy monstoure. And youcht we
condiscendit su^tyme to the election of this tyrane to our great damage. it
now for experience of his cruelte, we desire na thing mair than to be exonerat
thairof. Ye pepyll murnis accusyng their wylfull ygnorance, consentyng to sa
hye myscheuis in their awin perdition. And now their only esperance is in the.
Traisting be the to be deliuerit of their calamite. Thairfore (les tha^ the
affliction of thy pepil and thy awin proscription be thy may ples^ir) dre^
the to deliver thy pepyl of the tyranny be yame daily sustenit. For king Edward
(the may humane and gracious prince) sal not fail to support ye with all
pissance as thou ^esitis, because his realm was su^tyme oppressed be tyrannis. And
finaly delyuerit be grace of god and his awin manheid out of yair cruel handis.
Attour gif thou knawis not quhat beniuole^ce thy pepil hes to the. Thou may
understand su^ part be their wordis, thy pepyl ar murdrist in all partis as yis
bludy fleschoure ta^kis in heid. And yairfore thou nedis not to dout, bot thy
returnyng i^ scotland salbe richt plesand to all scottis men. For their
cruelteis daily done to ws should not be lamentit be effeminat pepyll, bot e^ar
reuengit be vaileant campionis. Sen thou art nocht only sauit fra invasion of
thy ennymes to bett fortoun. Bot ordanit be deuyne prouydence to deliver thy

How Malcolm Ca^more schevv him self vnabyl to be king for his syndry vices*
and how he come in scotland and was maid king thairof. And of Makbet his
deith. Ca. vii.
DOucht Malcolme was gretu^ly commouit for the sindry oppression and cruelt eis
done to scottis. it be great prudence he dissimulit his mind to have the better
experience of Makduffis intention. That is to say, to se gif he war cumyng to
the samyn effect as he desyrit. Or gif he war cumyn be dissait and industry of
Makbeth to betrais him or put him in his ennymes handis. And thairfore ^e
answerit. I am richt sorrowful for ye trubyll falling to my cuntre. And y^^cht I
have great affection thairto, it for certane irremediabyll vicis following me. I
am vnabyll ^uthir to govern the realm, or to releif the pepyll of ye trubill
that they presently sustene. First for immoderat lust the abhominabyl fontane
of all vicis, quhilk ragis i^ me with sic vndantit reneis. Yat gif I were maid
king of scottis I should deflore virginis and matronis in sic manner, yat my
intemperance should be mair importabyll to ow than the bludy tyranny of Makbeth.
To yis answerit Makduf, that is ane evil falt. For money nobyll princis and
kyngis been disherist and tynt both their life and kyngdomis for the samyn.
Nochtheles their is great plenty of weme^ in scotland. And yairfore will thou do
my counsall, make thy self king. I sall dres ye matter sa wisely, yat thou salbe
satifyit at thy pleseir, and thy vice salbe unknown. Than said Malcolme. I am
als the may auaricius man in erd, and I will seik sa money occasionis to
conques landis or gudis, that I will sla money of all the noblis of scotland be
feneit causis, to that fine yat I may reiose their realms, landis, and guddis.
And yairfore to schaw ow quhat infinite harms sal cum on ow be my insaciabyl
avarice. I will remembir bir ow ane fabil. Ane tod was ouirset with ane byke of
fleis, continewally souka^d out her blud. And quhe^ ane passinger be the gatt
had dema^dit hi^, gif scho wald have their fleis skalit fra her body. she
answerit na, because their fleis (that sat on her wou^dis) war all full of her
blud, and for fouth yairof sat with lytil displeseir. And gif they war skalit,
vtheres (quhilkis war mair every and tume) should licht in their rowmes, and souk
out the residew of her blude, quhilk war vnpro^^^tab^l. Heirfore suffir me
remane quhare I am, in adventure sic displeseir fall amang ow be my insatiable
avarice, that e sall eftir chase me out of our realm with more schame, and think
yir displeseiris now regnand amang ow bot small in respect of sic terrible
outragis, quhilkes sall appeir sone be my cumyng. To this answerit Makduf, this
is ane were falt than ye first. For avarice is the rute of all mischief. And ye
may part of all our kyngis ar slane for ye crime. Nochtheles make thy self
king, and do my counsall, thou sall have riches at ^outh. For yair is gold and
geir Ineuch in scotland to satifie ye at thy pleseir. Than said Malcolm. I am
full of lesingis and dissait, and reiosis in na thing sa mekle as to be trais
all thaym that geuis me credit or traist. And sen na thing semis mair ane
prince, yan constance, verite and Justice. And na thing sa vnsemand as falset,
treason and lesinges, You may consider how vnabil I am to govern any province
or cu^tre. And sen you hes sa money rameidis to color all ye la^^ of my vicis.
I pray ye to hyde or color this vice amang the laif, yan said Makduf. Yis is
the warst falt of all. And yair I leave the. O unhappy and miserable scottis,
quhilkes ar scurgit with sa money calamiteis ilk ane above other. e have now ane
cur^it devil that regnis above ow but any tityll. And distroyis ow be his
bludy tyranny. This other yt hes ye rycht to ye croun, is so repleit with ye
treasonable maneris and vicis of Inglismen, that he is unworthy to be king. For
be his awin confession he is nocht only auaricius and geuin to insatiable
lust. Bot so falls ane tratour, yat we may nocht trow ane wourd he sayis. Adieu
scotland. Now am I banist for euir but any confort or consolation, and with
their wourdis the teris fast halit ouir his cheikis. At last quhen he was makand
him to depart, Malcolme tuk him be the sleif, and said be of good confort. For I
have nane of their faltis. Howbeit I refusit only to have experience of thy
mind. For Makbeth hes oftymes be sic wayis desyrit my slaucht. And the more
slaw yat I was to condescend to thy mind. I salbe ye more deligent to fulfill
the same. Incontinent they enbrasit other and tuk auisement, How they mycht
provide all materis for their singular and common weil. Sone eft Makduf send
letteres to the nobillis of scotland schawing how Malcolme was co^fiderat with
him to cum haistely in scotland, and prayit yame, sen the said Malcolme was
Just heritour to ye croun, to assist to him, that he may recover ye samyn. In
ye mean time Malcome purchest the earl of Northumbirland to cum with.x.M. men
to help him to recover his realm. Their tithingis (fra they were schawin in
scotland) drew ye nobillis in two sindry factionis. Of quhilk the taken assistit
to Makbeth. and yis other to Malcolme. Throw quhilk raise aftymes sindry
frequent scarmussyng betuix yir partyis. For ye nobillis (quhilkis were of
Malcolmes opinioun) wald nocht ieoperd yame to vter chance of battall, quhil
his cu^yng out of Ingland to their support. Makbeth seeing finalie his ennymes
incres ilk day with more pissance, fled in Fi^, and abaid with all his freindis
and part takaris at Dunsi^ane with purpos to fecht with hes ennymes erar than to
fle out of ye realm schamfullie but any straik. His freindis gaif counsall
other to tak peace with Malcolm, or ellis to fle haistelie with his treasour
and gold in ye Ilis. To ye fin^, yat he mycht ^ee sindry great princis of ye
realm with his money to tak part aganis Malcolme. Nochtheles he had see
confidence i^ his fretis, yt he beleuit fermely neuir to be vincust, quhil ye
wod of Birnane war brocht to Du^synnane. nait to be slane with any man borne of
ane woman. Malcolme following ha^stely on Makbeth, come ye nycht before his
victory to the wod of Birnane. And quhe^ his army had refreschit yame ane
schort time, he co^mandit ilk man to tak ane bra^che of ye wod yt they micht
come on ye nixt morrow arrayit in the same manner in his ennymes sicht. Makbeth
seeing him cu^ in this gyse understood ye prophecy was completit yt the wiche
schew to him, nochtheles he arrayit his men. Skarsly had his ennimes cassin fra
yame the branches and cumand forthwart in battal, quhen Makbeth tuk the flicht.
on quhom followit Makduf with great hatrent saying. Tratour now thy insaciabyll
cruelte sall have ane end. Than said Makbeth, thou followis me in vane. For
nane (...) born of ane woman yt may sla me. Than said Makduf I am the same man.
For I was schorne out of my moderis w^mbe. Incontinent he slew Makb^^^. and
brocht his heid to Malcolme. This was ye end of Makbeth after yt he had
roung.xvi. eris. In ye beginning of his empire he did money p^offitabyl thingis
for ye common weil. Bot sone after be illusion of deuyllis, he was degenerat
fra his honest beginning in may terribyll cruelte, And slane, fra the
incarnation ane thousand.lxi.

Of the deith of Edmond Canut, h^rald, and hardy Canut, kingis of Ingland how
the crown of England was recouerit fra danis. and godovvine vveriit for ye
innocent slauchter of Alarude. Ca. viii.
NOw we will schaw how the empire of Ingland was taken fra danis, and restorit
to king Edward just heritour yairof. Quhen Canute and Edmond had pertit ye
realm of Ingland betuix yame be concord (as said is) ye realm was in good peace
four eris nixt following. For ylkane of yame dred ye pissance of other, ay
desiring to have ye hail empire of England under yair singular dominion. In ye
samyn time ane wickit and maliuolus man namit Edrik tuk purpos to attempt ane
hardy vassalage to cum i^ favor (as he beleuit) to ane of yir two princis. Yis
Edrik delyuerit in yis manner to have thankis or co^moditeis, awaitit, Quhen
king Edmond was sitta^d at hes eis and ane straik him throw ye scheir in his
bowellis. throw quhilk yis Edmond deceissit. Edrik after yis schamefull
slauchter went to Canute, and said. Hayl king of al Ingland. Canut astonist be
these salutation, began to demand how the matter stude mair diligently^ and quhe^
he fand king Edmond slane be treason of this unhappy man. he thocht na thing sa
good as to geif him reward according to his treasonabyll labor, and gart hyng
him on ane Iebat. Canut exonerat be yis way fra al suspicion of Edmondis deith
succedit with beniuolence of ye pepyll to y^ hail empire of Ingland. Sone eft
ane cou^sal was set in ye quhilk ye noblis delyuerit both king Edmondes la^dis
and his.ii. sonnis Edward and Edwyn in ye ha^dis of Canut, quhom he certane
eris tretit with great humanites. bot sone eft he changit his purpos, and thocht
to sla yame both yt the realm micht be stabillit to his posterite. Not la^g
eft he send yame to valgarius rege^t of Swedrik with quiet letteris to sla yame
both. nochyeles yis regent knawing ye innocent and nobyl blude of yir.ii.
children was mouit with sic reuth, that he send yame both to Salamon king of
hungary and maid Canut understand, yt al his chargis were done as he deuisit.
Eft deith of Canute succedit his son Herald namit for hes great swithnes hair
fut, quhilk reiosit ye croun of england two eris. Eftir quhome succedit his
brother Hardy canut, may vicious and proud tyrane yt euir rang above
Inglisme^. For he wald nocht suffir ye bonis of hes brothir to rest vnd erd.
Bot for unnatural dispit tuk up hes bonis, and set his heid upon ane hie
staik, quhair may confluence of pepil was in London. And kest ye residew of
his body i^ Thamis. He maid ane law, that every Inglisman sall bek and discover
his heid, quhe^ he met ane Dane. gif ane Inglisman and ane Dane come both to
ye brig atanis. y^ Inglisman sal tarry, quhill ye Dane be past ouir ye brig. The
Inglismen richt co^mouit of yir displesa^d lawis, co^spirit aganis ye Danis in all parts of Ingland, and callit al yair wageouris to supper, and slew yame all
quhen yai were full of wynis on ane nycht. Hardy Canut heirand al his me^ put
down be yis slicht of Inglismen, slew him self be disperatioun. Thus was
Ingland deliuerit fra tyranny of Danis. For schort time eftir ye noblis of
Ingland send ane of the great princis yairof namit Godowine, quhilk had maryit
before Canutis douchter in Normandy to bring two sonnis of Eldrede in Ingland,
and to resaue ye croun yairof. Yis Godowyne (because he maryit Canutis doucht)
thocht to co^ques ye croun to hes awin son. And yairfore at his cu^ing i^
Normandy he deuisit to distroy both ye sonnis of Eldred be poison. Ye eldest
son namit Alarude was slane be this manner. Bot Edward eschapit be mirakil of
god. And come sone eftir in England, quhair he ressauit ye croun^ Godowyne
seeing yt his attemptatis com not to purpos, durst not return in Ingland for
feir of ye treason yat he did aganis ye said Edward. Not yeles y^s Edward was
ane man but any rankoure. And sa reuthful to ye pepil yt he was reput ane
myrrour of virtew. Quhen Godowyne askit grace at him for ye slaucht of his
brothir, he not only remittit ye offense. Bot als maid his son Herald duk of
Oxfurd. And it yis cruelte done be Godowyne was not lang vnpunist. For within
schort time eftir he was standing at ye burd before king Edward. And quhen he
hard ye no^illis lament ye deith of Alarude ye kings brothir, he eit ane piece
of breid and said, god gif ye breid wory me gif euir I was other art or pert of
Alarudes slauchter. And incontinent he fell down weryit on ye breid. Ye noblis
astonist be yis deuyne punition, gaif loving to god yt he had punist yis
tyrane. and co^mandit his body to berijt vnd ye gallous. Bot we will return to
our historye quhair we left.

EDgar seeing ye crown of Ingland conquest (as said is be ye bastard of

And quhe^ he had remanit lang time at the watter of Tyne and durst assail na

How king Malcolme dantit sindry co^spiratouris in his realm. Of his great
devotion and liberalite to the kirk. with ane complaynt of riotus cheir. Ca.

EFtir that the two kingis were aggreit in this manner, Followit in scotland part
of trubill. The men of Galloway and Ilis raise with great noumer of pepil, and
maid great slauchter and heirschippis in all partis quhare they come. King
Malcolme to punys yir attemptates, send Walt the son of Fleance before
rehersit with ane band of chosyn men in Galloway. Finalie this Walter dantit
all their lymmaris with sic felicite, yt he was maid stewart of scotland, and
callit stewart to his surname. Eftir yat yis truble was dantit in yis wise
followit ane other of gretar motion. The Murrayis gaderit to yair opinioun ye
inhabitantis of Ros, Caithnes with sindry other pepill their about. And nocht
only slew ye kingis seruandis and ministeris of Justice. Bot be assistance of
Makduncane maid mair heirschippis and slaucht than was hard any time before. To
punis yir cruelteis were send Makduf with ane army in Mar. The inhabitantis
thairof astonist be his cu^myng, thocht na thing sa good as to stop his
inuasioun be their money. In the mean time happinnit king Malcolme to cum to
Monymusk. and gat aduertisyng, that al ye north pertis of scotland and ye Ilis
were confiderat with their Murrayis aganis him. Ye king affrayit be yir
tithinges, demandit his thesaurar, gif any landis were in yai boundis pertenand
to ye croun. And fra he was aduertist yt ye barony of Monymusk pertenit yairto,
He vowit it to sanct Andro to send him victory. At last quhen he was cu^yng to
Spay, and fand his ennimes of great power yan he mycht resist, he espyit his
baner man for feir of e^nimes trimbla^d, and not passand so pertlie forward as
he desyrit. Inco^tine^t he pullit the baner fra him. and gaif it to schir
Alexander Carron, quhilk gat money rich lands for ye samyn office. bot hes
name was turnit eft to Skrymgeour. Of quhilk is disce^dit ane nobil house
perseuerand it in great honor vnd ye samyn surname. Quhe^ king Malcolme was
cu^ing ouir ^pay quhair ye armyis were reddy to fecht on al sidis, they were
seuerit be interue^tion of prelates. and trewis taken vnd yir co^ditionis. Ye
co^monis sal return hame, and ye noblis sal submit yame to ye kings will* yair
liuis and lands saif, notyeles money of thaym war spuleit of their guddis, and
haldyn in preson to the end of their life. Sic thingis done king Malcolme be
persuasion of his haly queen gaif him haill to virtew, and began to do haly
werkis i^ sic manner, yt he excellit all other me^ in his days in fervent
devotion, and was sa obedient to his haly queen, that he left na thing undone,
yt pertenit to werkis of piete. Ye devotion of their two haly leuaris brocht
money pepyll be their imitation to clean lyf^. They contendit quhilk of thaym
should be may fervent in the luf of god. Agatha and her other douchter mouit to
religious maneris be example of yir two haly leuaris* left ye cumpany of pepyll
and went to ane private and solitare life, geuand thaym haill to their
contemplation. It is said the peace be and maid betuix Inglismen and scotts,
Edgar went to William king of Ingland quhare he gat certane landis to sustene
his estait. And become sa familiar to him, yt he was haldin with him in great
felicite to ye and of his life. Forthir king Malcolme ceissit not be imitation
of his wife to do good w^^kis, and gaif his extreme deligence to recover ye
thing that was tynt before be necligence of his predecessouris. Before this time
wa^ in scotland bot four bis^hoprikis. Sa^ct Andros, Glasgew, ^alloway, and
Murthlak. Sa^ct Andros and Murthlak stude in yat samyn manner as they stand now.
Bot Galloway and Glasgew war all desert, quhil they war restorit to their auld
dignite be king Malcolme, and two byschoprikis eikit to yame Murray and
Cathnes. It is said that (...) insolence raise that time amang our eldaris,
quhen the maneris, langage, and superflew cheir of Inglisme^ come first amang
ws, yat the noblis w^nt to king Malcolme, and lamentit heuely that this
vennomus pe^^ was burg^and fast in perdition of his pepyl. And prayit him to
rem^d the samyn that the pepyll micht leif with sic temperance as their eldaris
did before. For our eldaris eit nocht botanis on the day, desyryng na superflew

mekyll as nature requirit to yair necessar sustentation, hauand their bodyis in

arms and leggis, cumand like feirs lyonis aganis their ennymes, and war not
astonist thairwith. For they passit al strenth of man that is in their dayis.
King Malcolme tuk great lauboures to expel this spro^tand pest fra his pepyl.
Nochtheles the ingyne of ma^is sa unhappy, that it is mair reddy to evil than
any good werkis. Howbeit the scottis war before content of scarsnes, knawyng na
intemperat nor riotus surfeit. it fra they traistit ye vennomus bait yairof, it
incressit ylk day sa far, that na thing micht refrene the samyn. And it the
riotus and superflew maneris, quhilkes war brocht in this realm be cumyng of
Inglismen with king Malcolme, ar of lytyl comparison to sic thingis as ar vsit

Of ye deith of king William bastard of Normandy. Of si^dry noble actis done

QUhil sic thingis were done in scotland, king William ye conqueror deceissit
the.xx. eir of hes regne. Fra y^ incarnation.i.M.lxxxvi. eris. And left behind
him.iii. sonnis, Robert duke of Normandy, William with ye reid face, quhilk
succedit eft him to ye croun of England. And Henry Bewcleir, to quhom he left
great riches and iowellis. About yis time king Malcolme kest down the auld kirk
of Durame. And biggit it fra the ground with great magnificence* y^ priour of
yis abbay was namit Turgot, quhilk was eft maid bischop of sanct Andros, and
wrait the liuis of sanct Margaret and Malcolme in vulgar langage. He deceissit
i^ sanct Andros, but his body was br^^ht to Durame. Because he was prior sumtyme
thairof. King Malcolme be persuasion of this Turgot biggit ane kirk in
Dunfermelyng. quhilk was ordanit to be the common sepulturis of all kyngis of
scotland in times cumyng. Attour quhay list to know the life of king Malcolme
Ca^more and his blissit queen sanct Margaret, may return to the said Turgot,
quhilk schawis ye samyn at lenth. Amang money werkis quhilkes he did. It was not
litill to be co^mendit, that he abrogat the wickit law maid be king Ewin ye
third, and co^mandit half ane mark of money to be payit to ye lord of ye ground
in redemptioun of ye womannis chastity and honor. Callit it the merchetis of
women. This law was nocht vnlik to the thing that was vsit in ane town nocht
far fra Louane, quhare the good man redemit the use of his wife with great soumes
of money fra the lord of the ground. King William with ye reid face (eftir yt
he had ressauit the croun of Ingland) inuadit ye kirk with intolerable
iniuris. And reft fra ye samin all landis and rentis quhilk were geuyn to it
before. He kest down money abbayis. for yai were (as he alliegit) impediment to
his huntyng. He slew al his nobillis yat were repugnant to his doyngis. and
banist Anselme bischop of Canterbery, and wald suffir nane of his lynnage to
abide in his realm, because he repreuit his doyngis. Finalie herand that
scottis had ane great part of Cumbir and Northumbirland, he rasit his army, and
inuadit yame with great slaucht before any weris were denu^cit to yame. At last he
tuk ye castle of Anwik and slew all pepil found in it. King Malcolme to resist
sic thingis in the beginning, come with ane army in Northu^birland and segit ye
castle of Anwik. And quhen ye castle be la^g segeing was reddy to be ra^de^it,
ane knycht of Ingland intendyng to do ane hardy vassalage come on ane swift
horse out of the castle but armor. Beirand ye keyis of the castle on his speir
point. To signify ye castle reddy to be randerit. The wache seand him cum in
sic manner tuke na suspicion. Bot brocht him with great noyis and clamor to ye
kings paleon. Ye king heirand ye noyis, come out of ye paleon to se the cause
thairof. In ye mean time yis Inglisma^ held out ye keyis to king Malcolme. And
quhe^ ye king was lukand may deligently yairto, yis Inglisma^ ran him throw
ye left E^, and fled haistelie to the nixt wod. Yus was ye king slane in myddis
of all his army. It is said that king William of England changit the surname of
yis hardy knycht and callit him pers E, of quhome is discendit ane noble house
under the same surname, decorit with great honouris callit the erllis of
Nortu^birland. Ye scottis eftir slaucht of king Malcolme skalit fra the sege,
and returnit hame, and buryit king Malcolme in ye abbay of Tinmouth with in
Ingland. Bot he was taken up eft be Alexander his son and buryit in Du^fermelyng
before the Trinite after. Eftir deith of king Malcolme followit new displeseir.
For Edward prince of scotland eldest son to king Malcolm deceiss^t throw ane
^ond that he gatt at ane scarmus nocht far fra Anwik. And was buryit in
Dunfermelyng. Queen Margaret heirand ye deith of her husband and her son, fell
in malancoly, and decessit ye third day eft. King Malcolm was slane ye.xxv. eir

uncouth meruellis were seen in Albion. Be inundation of the Almane seis money
townis castellis and wodis were drounit both in Ingland and scotland. And in
this eir al ye la^dis of Godowyne be spait of seis was couerit with sandis. And
yairfore it is callit Godowyne sandis. Ye pepil beleuit this vengeance cumyn to
him and his posterite for the slaucht of Alarude as we ha^f schawin. Sindry
castellis and townis in Murray were cassin down be ye see fludis. Sic thundir
raise yt both men and beistis were slane, and great housis cassin down. In
Louthiane, Fiffe and Angus grene treis and cornis tuk neid fire. In the time of
king Malcolme was ane general counsal haldyn at Clairmont, in the quhilk
Urbane ye secound of ye name Institute ye houris and matynis of the blissit

Of king Donald ye.vii. and how the sonnis of king Malcolme fled in England.
how Duncane bastard son to king Malcolme vsurpit the croun, and was slane for
his tyranny, how Edgar recouerit hes realm. and of ye deith of Donald. ca.

MAlcolme had.vi. sonnis with sa^ct Margaret. Edward, quhilk was slane (as said
is) Etheldred quhilk deit in his tender age, and buryit in Dunfermelyng, Edmond
quhilk renuncet the world and leiffit ane haly life in Ingland. The tothir.iii.
war namit Edgar Alexander and David. Su^ authouris sayis this Edmond was put in
preson and slane be his oncle Donald bane. This Donald (as we schew before) fled
in the Ilis to eschew the tyranny of Makbeth. And after the deith of king
Malcolme his brothir, he returnit in Scotland be support of ye king of
Norroway. For he promittit to geif the Ilis of Scotland to perpetual dominion
of the said king, sa that he optenit the croun be his support. Donald finaly
tuk the croun with small difficulte. For the pepil detesting the riotus and
intemperat maneris brocht ama^g thaym be Inglismen, assentit sone to his
opinioun. And traistit because he was nurist with their auld customis and good
maneris, to recover be his seuerite the temperance of their auld progenitouris.
Als sone as Edgar bruthir to queen Margaret was aduertist that Donald Bane had
taken the croun of scottis, he brocht quietly hes three nepotis Edgar,
Alexander, and David with yair two sisteris in Ingland. And quhen he had kepit
yam certane time, ane knycht namit Organus mouit of malice and traistyng to get
reward thairfore accusit him of treason. Saying he nurist his sister sonnis and
douchteris within Ingland to be heritouris to the crown thairof. Bot this
malice was nocht lang vnpunist. For the said Organe was slane be ane freid of
Edgar, quhilk assistit to the said Edgar and defendit his action in singular
batta^l to the deith. Quhen Donald had resauit ye croun at Scone, he fand part
of the nobillis nocht afald to his opinion, hauand more benevolence to ye
childrin of king Malcolme than to him. And for ye cause he said amang his
familiaris eft collation, that his nobillis should haistelie repent their
doyngis, les yan they applyit yame to his opinionis. Bot their wourdis w^r depar
prentit in yair minds yan he beleuit. In ye mean time schir Du^cane bastard
son to king Malcolme was send out of Ingland be support of king William with ye
reid face to put king Donald fra ye croun. King Donald aduertist of his ^u^yng,
met him with ane army. And quhen ye battallis were reddy to June, money of ye
noblis and co^monis of scotland com fra donald to schir Duncane. Thus was
Donald constranit to flee in ye Ilis. Schir Du^cane come haistely with his
victorius army to Scone, and tuk the crown. and because he was more exercit in
cheualry than any administratioun of Justice, he traistit na thing Just nor
richt, bot as it succedit be swerd and rycht of battal. Followit infinite
trubill and deuisionis in ye realm. Donald Bane heirand yir diuisionis amang
ye lordis, solistit Makpender earl of Mernis to assist to his opinion. And
finalie slew king Duncane slepand in his bed. Eftir that he had roung ane eir
and ane half. And because this Duncane was ane tyrane geuyn to cruelte and
blude, few menit his slaucht, or thocht it evil done. Eftir his slaucht Donald
was restorit to the croun, quhilk he brukit before schir Du^cane ane eir and.vi.
months. And sa ye realm was in co^tinewall trubill.iii. eris be their
tyranny. Ye nobillis socht money occasionis to finis his empire. In ye mean time
raise great slauchteris and heirschippis in all partis of ye realm. And
nochtwithstanding yis division and trubill amang the lordis, it the weris
continewit aganis Inglismen. Howbeit na thing followit worthy to haif memory.
Nocht lang eftir Magnus king of Norroway come with ane ^lote of schippis about
al ye Ilis of scotland and garnist all the strenthis thairof with men, munition
and vittallis, and maid ye samyn lawis and institutionis quhilkis ar it vsit in
ye Ilis. The scottis hauand great indignation yt ye Ilis of scotland should pas
vnd uncouth empire, send yair oratouris to Edgar quhilk was fourt son to
malcolme, desiring him with great instance to recover his faderis heritage and
croun of scotland. Edgar sone eftir send his ambassatouris to hes eme donald.
Promitti^g (gif he wald exoner him of ye croun plesandlie sen it pertenit nocht
to him) to deliver to him great lordschippis in Louthiane. Yir ambassatouris be
cruelte of king Donald were finalie slane. Edgar rycht desirus to revenge their
iniuris come in scotland with ane great power be support of William king of
Ingland. And quhen he was cu^yng to Durame, he gat ane visioun in his sleip.
(Gif he rasit the baner of sanct Cuthbert) He should haif victory. On the morrow
he enterit in the abbay of sanct Cuthbert quhair he gar^ do deuyne service with
may reverence. and sone eft (as he was co^ma^dit in his vision) he displayit
sa^ct Cuthbertis baner. Nochtheles king Donald met him with arrayit oistis. And
eftir lang battall he was chasit in ye Ilis, quhair he was taken and finalie
brocht to Edgar and put in preson quhare he sone eftir deceissit. Edgar eft
this victory went to Dunfermelyng to holy the sepulturis of his blissit mo^^r
sanct Margaret and his remanent brethir. Syne maid ane conuention of his
nobillis at Scone, quhare he ^essauit ye croun. And was ointit be Godrik
bischop of sanct Andros the eir of god.i.M.i.C. and ane eir. For sa^ct Margaret
purchest schort time before her deceis fra paip Urbane, y^ ^f^er her al kings
of scotland should be ointit. And thairfore Edgar was the first king of scottis
that was ointit. Yis privilege was co^fermit after be paip Iohne the secound of
ye name.

Of ye vassalage done be sindry cristin princis in the haly land. How Mald
eldest douchter to king Malcolme was mariit on the king of Ingland, and ye
ou^gest douchter maryit on ye earl of Bolony. Of their succession. and of the
deith of king Edgar. Ca. xiiii.
Two eir before ye coronation of king Donald money nobyll men passit to the haly
land, amang quhom was Robert duk of Normandy, Godofrid duk of Lorne, Ye earl of
Blasen, Ye earl of Flanderis, with money other princis of France. And because
they went to inuaid ye sarazenis and gaif large feis to yair men of armis, yai
gaderit ane army of mair pissance and nowmer of pepil tha^ ever was seen before.
Yis army went first throw Greece and co^sta^tinople* sine com throw ye seys
callit Hellespontus with displayit baner to litill Asia, and wan ane s^rang
town namit Antioche in ye land of Siria, quhare yai war warnit be ane vision of
sa^ct Andro ye appostil, yt ye speir heid ye persit cristes heart was hid under
ye erd in ye kirk of sa^ct Peter. Finaly after money stra^g townis taken be yame
yai tuk Jerusalem y^ heid town of Iowry. fra our redemption.i.M.lxxxxix. eris.
And because ye haly land was recouerit in yis manner fra sarazenis ye pepyl maid
frequent processionis throw al partis of cristindome, geuand loving to almichty
god for their happy victoryis falling to cristin princis. After yis fell ane
great contention ama^g yame quha should be king of Iowry, ylkane refusit ye
honor, and knawing himself not worthy to sustene sa great charge. At last be
general vocis Robert duk of Normandy was chosyn to be king. Nochtheles because
he was aduertist yt his brothir king William of Ingland with ye reid face was
deceissit but any airis of his body. He refusit ye croun of Iowry, traisting
mair expedient for him to have ye empire of Ingland with ye duchery of
Normandy, tha^ to be king of Iowry, and yairfore he gaif his richt yairof to ye
duk of Lorane. Sic thingis done money of yir cristin princis returnit hame.
Robert duk of Normandy was frustrat both of ye croun of Iowry and Ingland, for
after yt he had refusit to reiose ye croun of Iowry, he was preuenit be his
brothir Hary Bewcleir of ye croun of Ingland. This Hary Bewcleir mariit Mald
eldest sister to king Edgar of scotland, And king Edgares secound sister namit
Mary was maryit on Eustachius earl of Bolony, and ^uce to him ane douchter
quhilk was heritoure to Bolony, and was maryit after on Steuyn earl of March
in Ingland quhilk succedit immediately to the croun thairof. For he was nepot to
king Hary Bewclere as we sal after schaw. Yis Hary bewcleir gat on Mald first
sister to king Edgar two sonnis namit Richard and William, and two douchteris
namit Effem and Mald. Bot we will ruturn to our hystory. King Edgar for the
beniuolence schawin to him be sanct Cuthbert gaif al ye la^dis of Colding hame
to the monkis of Durame, and gaif ye town of Berwik to Canulphus bischop of
Duram. And because this Canulphus co^mittit sindry treasonabyl dedis aganes king
Edgar, he tint ^aith ye keeping of Berwik and was depriuat of his benefice.
Queen Mald after ye scho was maryit on king Hary bewcleir gaif her to singular
virtew following ye life of her blissit mother sanct Margaret. throw quhilk scho
was ane myrrour of good leuyng to all pepyl of Ingland. King Edgar had na
uncouth weris nor trubyl in his dayis and gouernit his realm in good peace, and
was haldin in mair veneration than terror amang his pepyl, quhil at last he
deceissit the.ix. eir of his regne at Du^de. And was burrit in Dunfermelyng fra
our redemption.i.M. and.ix. eris.

After deith of king Edgar, succedit ye.v. son of Malcolme namit Alexander ye

regne, ye Murrayis and Rossis seeing him continually exercit in sic

quhare yai come. King Alexander to dant yir attemptatis come with sic diligence
on their co^spiratouris, yt they war finaly taken and punist to the deith. At hes
returnyng hame, ane woman fell on knees before him in dolorus array, co^plening
ye both her son and husband war slane be ye master of Mernis. King Alexander
mouit wi^h yis pietuus co^playnt lichtit down of his horse, and come never on

purpos in his returnyng to repare ye castle of Baledgar, quhilk was foundit
before be king Edgar i^ Gowry. quhair great multitude of theuis vsit to remane in

yis nobill prince come to visie the mad^^ castle of Edinburgh. At this time
all the boundis of scotland were full of woddis, lesou^es, and medois. For ye
cu^tre was more geuin to store of bestiall than any productioun of cornys. And
about this castle was ane great forest full of hari^, ^^ndis, toddis and
siclike manner of be^stis. Now was the Rude day cumyn callit the exaltation of
the croce. And because ye samyn was ane hie solemn day, ye king past to his

namyt Alkwine, chan^^n eftir ye ^rdour of sanct Augustyne. quhilk was lang time
confessoure before to king David in Ingland, the time yet he was earl of
Huntingtoun and Northumbirland. This religious man dissuadit the king be money
reasonis to pas to this huntis. And allegit ye day was so solemn be reverence
of the h^ly Croce, that he should gif him (...) for that day to contemplation
than any other exercition. Nochtheles his dissuasionis lityll a^alit. For the
king was finalie so prouokit be in oportune solicitatioun of his baronis, that
he past nochtwithstandyng ye solempnite of yis day to his hou^tis. At last
quhen he was cumyn throw the vail that lyis to the great eist fra the said

apperit to his sycht the farest heart yt euir was seen before with leuand
creator. Ye noyis and din of yis heart ry^na^d (as apperit) with auful and
braid ^yndis maid the kings horse so effrayit, that na remeis mycht hald him,
bot can yer f^^ce ouir mire and mos^is away with ye king. Nochtheles ye ha^t
followit so fast, that he dang both the king and his horse to ye ground. Than
ye king kest and bak his handis betuix ye tyndis of yis heart to haif sa^^t him
fra ye strak yairof. and ye haly croce slaid inco^tine^t in hes hands, yt heart
fled away with gre^ violence, and euanist in ye same place* quhare now springis
the rude well. Ye pepyll richt affrayitly returnit to him out of all partis of
ye wod to comfort him after his trubyll, and fell on kneis deuotly adoryng ye
haly croce. For it was not cumyn but su^ heuinly prouydence, as weill apperis.
For yair is na man can schaw of quhat matter it is of, metal or tree. Sone eft ye
king returnit to his castle. And in ye nicht following, he was admonist be ane
vision in his sleip, to big ane abbay of cha^nonis regular in ye same place,
quhare he gat ye croce. Als sone as he was awalkinnit he schew his vision to
Alkwine his confessor. And he na thing suspendit his good mind, bot erar
infla^mit him with may fervent devotion yairto. Ye king incontinent send his
traist seruandis in France and Flanderis, and brocht rycht crafty masonis to
big this abbay. Syne dedicat it in ye honor of yis haly croce. Yis croce
remanit continewally in y^ said abbay, to y^ time of king David Bruce, quhilk
was unhappily taken with it at Durame, quhare it is haldin it i^ great
veneratio^. Yis abbay was laitly in gouerna^ce of ane good man den Robert
Bellenden abbot.xvi. eres. He dealt ylk owlk iiii. ^owis of quheit and.xl.s. of

bellis, the great brasyn fount.xxiiii. capis of gold and sylk. He maid ane
chalice of fine gold, ane eucharist with sindry challicis of silver. He
theikkit ye kirk with leid. He biggit ane brig of leith ane other ouir Clide*
with money other good werkis, quhilkis war ouir prolixt to schaw. Nochtheles he
was sa (...) be sindry other prelatis, because he was not geuyn to lust and
insolence after yair manner, yt he left the abbay, and deit ane chartour monk.

Of the great liberalite of king David tovvart ye kirk in damage of his
successouris and of the battall of Allartoun* and how peace was maid betuix
scottis and Inglismen. Ca. xvii.
King David biggit.xv. abbayes in scotland, quhais namis ar Halyrudhous, kelso,
Iedburgh, melros, Newbottel, Holmcultrane, Du^dranane, Ca^buske^neth, Kinlois,
Du^fermeling, Holme i^ Cu^ber.ii. Nu^rijs ane at Carlele and ane other at North
Berwik. He foundit.ii. abbayis beside ye New castle, y^ taken of sanct
Benedictes ordour, and ye other of quhit mo^kis. He fou^dit.iiii. bischoprikes.
Ros, Brechin, Du^keld, and Du^blane, and dotat yame with great rentis, landis,
and possessionis. Sindry prudent me^ na thing apprisis the great liberalite of
king david toward ye kirk, for he dotat ye kirk sa richely with ye la^dis
pertenand to ye croun, yt his successoures micht not sustene yair riall estait
eft him sa weil as yai did before, and for ye cause he hes been ye deith of money
nobyl princis i^ these realm, geuand yame su^ time occasion to bring great housis
to nocht to co^ques la^dis to sustene ye croun. Sum time inuading ye cu^tre
with co^tinewal stentis, and importabyl exactionis on ye pepyl. And su^ time
co^stranis yame (as disparit princes) to inuaid Ingland with battal takand na
solicitude quhat cu^ of yair life, and su^ time prentand evil money aganis ye
common weil. Al yir mischeui^ hes followit sen syne i^ yis realm because the
croun was left indegent throw ampliation of great rentis to ye kirk. Howbeit
king David did the samyn (as he beleuit) for the best. for ye pepyl war sa
simple i^ they dayis, that they traistit fermely na man mycht have sa syngulare
favor of god, as he yt gaif may riches and landis to ye kirk. Thairfore ye
wise prince king James ye first (quhen he com to Dauidis sepulture) at
Dunfermelyng said, he was ane soi^ sanct for the crown. as he wald mean y^ king
David left ye kirk ouir rich and ye crown ouir pure. For he tuke fra the crown
(as master Iohne Mair writis in his cronikles) lx.M.^i. scottis, quhilk is
possedit this day be ye kirk to na les damage of common weil, tha^ perditioun
of good religion. For gyf king David had consider^t the maneris and nurising of
deuote religion, he had nothir dotat the kirkis with sic riches, nor it biggit
thaym with sic magnificence. For the superflew rentis of kirkes (now as they ar
vsit) are not only occasion to evil prelatis to rage in may insolent and
^orruppit life. bot ane sicker not to draw al manner of gold and silver out of
these realm. Howb^it les damage w^ld succeid, gif the abbayis war prouid^t be
yair ordinaris but any dyspensation fra yair habit and religious maneris, and
the ordinaris be their primat but any exemption. And y^ primat be yair cou^sal
prouincial. For in verite wtin their.lxx. eris na manner of benificis bot
allanerly bischoprikes eid to Rome. And sen syne we se quhat infinite gold and
silver is taken out of these realm be their continewal promotion. And thairfore,
this realm salbe brocht to sic irrecouerabyll pouerte be continewal promotion
of prelatis within few eris, that it salbe ane facyl pray to our ennymes. For
it may not sustene now sa great charge in time of weir, as it has done before be
our eldaris. And because nothir spiritual nor temporal estait within this
realm hes any affection to the common weil thairof, bot ylk man se^ allanerly
for his awin singular way. I will deplore na mair the calamiteis succedyng daily
be their imprudence. Bot will return to our histor^ quhair we left. King David
translatit ye sait of Murthlak to Ab^^dene, quhare money nobil bischoppes hes
been, as we sall after schaw. King David had ane son namit Hary gotin (as we
have schawin) on Mald heritour to Northumbirland, Cu^ber. and Huntingtoun. Yis
Hary was maryit on the earl of Warra^nis douchter, and gat on her three sonnis.
Malcolme, William. and David. And three douchteris. Adama, Margaret, and Mald.
In ye mean time king Dauides house was in great displeseir. For his wife
deceissit in her flurisant eris, and was buryit at Scone. fra our redemption
ane.M.i.C.xxxii. eris in ye.vii. eir of ye regne of king David. After her deith
king David passit the residew of his dayis but any cu^pany of women. Quhil sic
thingis war done in Scotland, Mald douchter to Hary Bewcleir returnit in
Ingland. For her husband Hary ye fourt of ye name empriour was deccissit but
any aires of his body. At her cumyng in England, her fader king Hary maid ane
general co^uention of all his noblis, and ga^t yame sweir to defend the said
Mald his douchter as just heritour to ye croun of Ingland, syne maryit her on
Gawfrid Plantaginet earl of Angeos. to quho^ scho bure ane son namit Hary,
quhilk was after king of Ingland callit be the pepyll y^ son of ye empress. At
yis time Robert duk of Normandy deceissit but any succession of his body, be
quhais deith the duchery come to Hary Bewcleir his brothir. Yis Hary Bewcleir
deceissit fra our redemption.i.M.i.C.xxxiiii. eris. Yan succedit great trubil in
Ingland. for Mald the empress was in the time of his deith with her husband
Gawfrid Plantaginet at Angeos, quhilk was that time in great infirmite, haua^d
her son hary bot.ii. eris of age. In the mean time Steuyn earl of Bolony,
sister son to Hary Bewcleir, gaderit ane great army to cu^ in Ingland, yt he
micht co^ques ye croun yairof. And first (as he war to vndermynd ye cuntre be
his slichtis) he desirit ye croun to be geuyn to him, quhil prince Hary war of
lauchful age to succeid. Ye noblis sea^d his petitio^is reasonable maid him
king, and randerit all ye strenthis of ye cuntre garnist with me^, munition,
and vittallis at his pleseir. Schort time after king Steuin send ane herald to
king David of scotland chargea^d him to cu^ but any tarry in Ingland to geif his
^ith of fidelite and homage for the landis of Northu^birland, Huntingtoun, and
Cu^bir* with i^timation, gif he refusit, to inuaid him with battal. king David
answerit yt he gaif his aith before for yir la^dis to Mald his wife, and sen it
was not lefull to violat his aith, he wald erar stand at ye faith yt he hes
promised, tha^ to applaud to new inuasouris* King Steuin mouit be this answer
send ye duk of Gloucester with ane army i^ Northu^birland, quhilk stude ye time
under ye empire of scottis, and maid incredibyll slauchter and heirschippis in
all pertis thairof. Ye scottis mouit with yir iniuris ceissit not, quhil yai
reco^pensit ye said iniures on Ingland. for ye erlis of March, Menteth, and
Angus went i^ Ingland with ane great power and faucht at Allirton, quhare ye
Inglismen war disco^fist, and money noblis of Ingland with the said duk brocht
presoneris in scotland. King Steuyn throw this disco^fitour was co^stranit to
redeem ye said duk and hes noblis with huge money, and in payment of their
redemption gaif ouir al richt and clame, yt he or his successouris micht any
way have to Northu^birland, Cu^bir, and Huntingtoun. Nochtheles after ye
redemption of his noblis, he become penitent of yis discharge foresaid, and
come i^ Northu^birla^d, quhare he maid great slauchter and heirschippes throw
all bou^dis yairof to recover it to his dominion. King David to resist yir
iniuris, gaderit ane army with deliuerit mind other to expel Inglisme^ out of
al bou^dis pertenand to his empire, or ellis al atanis to de. Eft his cumyng to
Roxburch come to him yt bischop of ork and maid peace for.iiii. monethis vnd
yir co^ditionis, y^ Inglismen sal deliver Northu^birland fre to Hary prince of
scotland. And because their co^ditionis war not kepit, king David come with ane
new army i^ Northu^birla^d, and left na Inglisme^ in it on live. King Steuyn to
revenge yir iniuris com with great ordinance to Roxburgh, and was constranit to
return hame but any invasion of scottis, because his noblis wald not assist to
his purpos. At last peace was tretit under yir co^ditionis. Northu^birland and
Huntingtoun sal remane under the empire of Hary prince of Scotland be richt of
his mother. And Cu^ber to remane with him be richt of king David his fader. And
for their landis ye said Hary and his successouris sall make homage to al kingis
of Ingland for ye time,

Of the deith of Hary prince of scotland* of the orison maid be king David to
his noblis. how Malcolm his first nepot was maid prince of scotland. and
Vvillia^ his secou^d nepot earl of Northu^birland. Of the deith of king David.
and of sindry great clerkis. Ca. xviii.
THe peace ratifijt in this manner, king Steuyn returnit to Kent. And king David
to Cu^bir, quhare he remanit certane time reparyng the town of Ca^lele with
new walls. Their war the dedis of king Steuyn the third e^^ of his regne. In
the.iiii. eir Mald ye empress, come in Ingland with ane army to recover her
heritage and left behind her Gawfrid her husband with her oung son in Angeos. At
her cu^myng both ye earl of Ch^ster and Glacester with money other yair
freindis went to her opinion, and because ye residew of ye noblis assistit to
king Steuyn, ye decision of yis ple^ co^tinewit with lang weris in Ingland with
sindry chancis of fortoun. In ye mean time Hary her sone maryit Elynore, quhilk
was heritour of ye (...) of turing and of ye erldomes of Poyteris and Man's.
Throw quhilk he was supportit and come with ane great army in Ingland.
Nochtheles quhen ye battallis war reddy to june, peace was maid in this manner.
Hary sall have ane part of ye landis pertenand to the croun of Ingland to
sustene him during the life of king Steuyn, and after his deith to succeid to
ye h^le empire of Ingland. Yis Elynor^ was maryit before on Lewis dalphin of
france and partit with him because scho was co^^unit to him in proximite of
blud. Scho bure to this Hary ane son namit E^^hard, quhilk was after heritour
of England, Normandy, Angeos, and Gascune be richt of his ^ad, and was heritour
of the duchery of Turyng, poyte^es and Man's be his mod. Sic thi^gis done i^
Ingland Hary son to king David of scotland deceissit with great lament of
pepyll, and left behynd him (as we have said before) three so^nis of small age. He
was buryit in ye abbay of Kelso ye eir fra our redemptioun i.M.i.C.lii. eris.
Ye deith of yis Hary was richt displesand to king David, for he was ane prince
of singular virtew and good maneris, Eft deith of Hary ye noblis co^uenit f^^th
of al partis of scotland to make ^^solation to king David for ye dolor yt he
tuk in ye deith of his son. it because Hary left behynd him.iii. sonnis and.iii.
douchteris on live, they thocht ye realm weil garnist. King David seeing his
noblis richt dolorus and heavy for ye deith of hes son, callit yame to ane
ba^ket, and said i^ these manner. Tender freindis our true faith and perseuerand
delige^ce for my weil is richt patent yis day, howbeit na experience in time
bigane had been thairof. For I se our minds geuyn to me with na les compassion
on my heaviness, than any of our awin so^nis had deceissit. e ar cumyn to make me
consolation for the dolor that I have taken in ye deith of my son. And because
we may not rander ow condign thankis at this time, we superseid it quhill we
may do it mair plesandly, as now it is ynouch to confess, all thing yt is in me
both body and saul is dettit to ow. Forthir concerning ye matter yt e ar cumyn
for schawyng our humanyte towart me, e may have my mind in few wordis. My
parentis (quhom I believe eikit to ye nowmer of sa^ctis for ye singular and

quhilk dois na thing i^ vane, bot every thing disponis be hes infinite wisdom

man nix^ follow. And sen we are mortale, al aduersite should be patiently sufferit
be ws, les than we be corruppit life list thirl our self to eternal deith. I
think thairfore yt I should erar reiose y^ god gaif me ane son be hes special

their lugeingis, hauand great admiration of ye kings constant devotion and
mind. Sone eftir king David causit Malcolme eldest son of Hary before rehersit
to be declarit prince of scotland, and ye nobillis sworn in his opinion. Eftir
this he went in North^birland. And maid William his secund nepot earl thairof.
Eftir yis he went to Carlele quha^^ he maid Hary prince of Ingland ^nycht. And

In the time of king David were money nobill clerkis. As Richard scottisman

and haly life, yat he was namyt Malcolme ye madin. In the first eir of his
empire Hary prince of Ingland tuke ye croun. throw quhilk king Steuin tuke sic
malancoly that he deceissit. At this time was ane miserable derth throw all
boundis of scotland. And sone eft followit ane violent pest (howbeit it was not
contagius) to ye great mortalite both of man and best. This mortalite gaif
occasioun to Somerled to attempt ane matter of hiear besynes, than semyt to his
estait. And because he saw the ta half of ye realm slane be pest, and this

And thairfore be counsall of his nobillis, h^ send ane herald to king Malcolme
Chargeand him to cum to London (...) make homage and service to him for ye

this condition, that it should nocht be prejudicial to the liberte of scotland.
King Hary had weir at yis time aganis Lewis the.vi. king of France. And
constrani^ king Malcolm to pas with him in France. For yocht king Malcolme had

Malcolme and his nobillis in times bigane. Bot to renew the samyn with more
displeseir, he causit king Malcolme to return agane to ork. Eftir his returnyng
thairto, he complaynit to his noblis that king Malcolme reuelit all the
secretis of his army to franchemen to na litill damage and slauchter of his
pepill. And said thairfore the samin was sufficient reason to deprive him of
the landis of Cumbir, Huntyngtoun, and Northu^birland. Youcht king Malcolme be
money sufficient reasonis declarit yir ymaginationis of vane effect. it king
Hary before king Malcolmes returnyng in scotland send wourd to the nobillis
yairof, that king Malcolme had renuncit all clame that he had to the said
landis to make him odious to all his realm and liegis. Als sone as he was
returnit in Scotland, money of the nobillis conspirit aganis him, and segit him
in the castle of Bertha. Howbeit he knew na thing of yir iniuris wrocht aganis
him be slycht of Inglismen. Nochtheles fra they knew the verite, they skalit
fra the sege and askit him mercy. King Malcolme mouit with their iniuris and
seand his landis haldin wranguslye fra him, rasit his army and inuadit Ingland
with sindry displeseiris. At last eftir sindry chances of battall, ane
co^uention was maid at Carleil and peace maid in this manner. Northumbirland

How king Malcolme punist syndry conspiratouris* and how the Murrayis for
their rehellion war disherist and put out of Murray. Ca. ii.
THis trubill beand mesit i^ manner before Rehersyt, followyt ane other. howbeit
it was of les motioun. Angus thane of Galloway seand his atte^ptates micht not
cu^ to effect (quhen yai were quietly done) come with ane great cu^pany to
usurp ye croun. Nochtheles his army was disco^fist be Gilcrist earl of Angus.
And him self chasit to Quhiterne, quhare ane girth is dedicat in ye honor of
sa^ct Niniant. King Malcolme wald not brek ye girth. Nochtheles he co^mandit
ane guard to wait on this Angus sa lang, quhill he come in will. King Malcolm to
dant his insolence, and that he should nocht have occasioun to do sic attemptatis
intymes cuming, co^fiscat the may part of all his landis, and tuke his son
in pledge for good reule of him in times cummyng. Angus seeing that he mycht
nocht sustene his estait (quhen his landis were taikin fra him) as before, schoif
his heid in Halyrudhous and deceissit ane channon thairof. Nocht lang eftir
raise ane other trubil of siclik motioun. The Murrayis be advise of Gildo their
capitane, heryit Ros Bogeall, Mar, Gareach, Buch quhen and mernis. And slew ye
kingis seruandis quhilkis were send to inquire ye motive of yair iniuris. To
punys their attemptatis king Malcolme send Gilcrist earl of Angus with ane army
in murray. Nochtheles the murrayis put him to flycht. King Malcolme
(nochtwithsta^ding yis disco^fitour) come with displayit baner ouir Spay, and
dantit ye murrayis with syndry victoryis. And in punition of their offencis, he
co^mandit nane of thaym to be saiffit except wyffis, barnis, and agit personis,
to be exemple to all other his subdittis to move rebellyon aganis him in times
cumyng. The murrayis beand on this wise neir distroyit in all partis of the
realm, the king co^mandit new pepyll to be set down in their la^dis for the
inhabitation thairof. In the mean time Somerled thane of Argyle (quhilk was
banist as we have schawin in Ireland) traisting king Malcolme to be odius to
his nobyllis and co^monis for his cruelte vsit aganis ye Murrayis, thocht
expedi^^^ to assail new chance of fortoun, and returnit with certane nakit me^
in scotland, bot his attemptatis com to mair infelicite than before, For he was
vincust, and hingit on ane Ie^^it be command of king Malcolme.

How the byschop of sanct Andros persuadit Malcolme to marriage. of synd^y
actis done be king Malcolme, and of his deith. Ca. iii.
MAlcolme void of all solicitude and charge of battall, and hauand ennymes in
na parts, set his engyne to govern his realm in Justice. And because he had two
sisteres reddy to marriage namit Margaret and Adame, he maryit the first on the
duke of Bertane, and this other on the earl of Holland. Sic thingis done he set
ane counsall at Scone for certane materis concerning ye common weill. The
nobyllis beand assemblit, raise up ane man of syngulare prudence namit Arnald
bischop of sanct Andros, and said in their wise. Ane thing is (may nobyll
prince) that I wald say for the commoun weill, praying thairfore thy hyenes to
geif eiris thairto. for it sal pertene na les to thy syngulare honor than
common weil. Not lang ago thou tuk purpos to pas thy time but fruit of marriage.
And sen thou tuke this purpos in thy tender outh (howbeit it was be ele of
virtew) it gif thou geif eiris to me (quhilkis neuir exhortit yt to vane
purpos) Thou will change thy mind as vnproffitabyll to the governance of thy
realm. For quhat thing may be mair honest than marriage, quhilk was not
Institute be Mynois king of Crete, nor Ligurgus king of Lacedemon. nor Solon of
Athenes. Howbeit they war may civil and prudent men in their constitutionis,
bot allanerly be god, as may honest and proffitabyll to the nature of man.
And gyf that wise and prudent begynnar of the world had found any other thing
mair proffytabyll than marriage, he had commandit it for weill of man. Attoure
quhat is mair proffytabyll than it, that bryngis all leuand creaturis in ye
world. Quhat is than mair natural than coniunctioun of male and female. And
youcht thou wald allege* Crist and money other his sanctis leiffit chaist. I say
sic life is nocht ordanit for publict personis, Nor it for every stait, bot
allanerly for religious men, and precheouris of the lawis. bot thou art chosyn
to ane other office. That is to say, to govern thy pepyl in Justice, And to
leif succession of thy body, that may proffet the commoun weill after thy
deith. Quhat thing may be mair plesand or proffitabyll to the, than to have ane
lady to thy fallow, quhilk may gei^ the consolatioun in every doloure or
aduersite that may fall. To do the pleseir in thy heill. To meis the quhen
angir apperes. To cure thy body and refresche thy spreit quhen thou art weary.
And despair nocht bot sum lady may be found rycht aggreabyll to thy
conditionis. Other pryuat personis mycht have solicitude or great cummer in

Heirfore sen na thing is sa commendabyll, sa honest, nor it sa proffitabyll to

assaileit with their and money other reasonis to persuade the king to marriage.
The king was mair repugnant to the samyn than before, For he was institute sa in
his outh, that he dedicat his virginite to Crist. Nochtheles god prouidit that
the realm should nocht want ayris to govern the samyn in Justice. Nocht lang
after king Malcolme fell in ane heavy malady, and be noy thairof he was
constranit to tak peace with his nichtbouris. And in the mean time he foundit
the abbay of sanct Reule now callit sa^ct Andros* quhilk is biggit (as we se)
with great magnificence. Bot he dotat it with small rentis sufficient ynouch to
sustene divine service. And thairfore the channonis of the said abbay leuit
than in may fervent deuotioun and service of god, because they had na
prouocatioun of lustis be superflew rentis, nocht geuyn to avarice and pleseir
bot only to their contemplatioun. He foundit als the abbay of Cowpa^ after the
ordoure of Cistius, and dotat it in ye honor of ye blissit virgyne Mary with
money landis and possessionis. At this time Thomas of Cantorbury (ane man of
syngulare life and deuotioun) was exilit out of Ingland* King Malcolme fynaly
vexit with lang infirmite deceissit at Iedburgh the.xii. eir of his regne. Ane

MAlcolme buryit on this manner in Dunfermelyng, Wyllya^ his brothir callit for
his syngulare Justice the lyoun, was maid king. After his coronatioun, he
thocht na thing sa honest, as to recover the landis reft before fra his brothir
king Malcolme, and send his ambassat^uris to king Hary desyryng Northumbirland
to be restorit to him, because it pertenit to him be kyndly heritage. King Hary
answerit he should haif al thyngis pertenand to him be reason, sa that he wald
(as his eldaris did before) cum to London and make homage for the landis of
Cumber and Huntyngtoun, King Wylliam sone after come to London, and quhen he
had maid his obedience for the said landis, he desyrit Northumbirland to be
restorit to him. King Hary re^^sit their desyris. Saying, the lands (quhilkis
war annerit to the crown) mycht nocht be seuerit thairfra be any private
auctorite. Nochtwithsta^ding he promittit to conuene his nobyllis to ane
counsall to fulfill his desyris, gif they war found reasonabyll quhen time
occurrit mair expedient. In the mean time king Hary went with ane army in
Normandy and causit king Wyllyam with money other nobyllis of scotland to pas
with him in the said iornay. King Wyllyam wald not refuse yir chargis at this
time in adventure the samyn war occasion to repel his desyris. At last quhen
he had taryit lang time in this army, and was in na esperance to recover his
landis, he desyrit license to return hame. quhilk beand with great difficulte
grantit, King Wyllyam with his nobyllis come throw Ingland ye may haiste way
he mycht in Scotland and set his ingyne to punys the cruelteis done be theuis
and tratouris of his realm. This act be my estimatioun was the may
proffytabyll thing that he mycht have done. For gyf any wise men will consydder
both the damage and commoditeis of this realm, they sall find the skaith and
damage done be theuis, ar mair displesand and skaithful to ws, than any weiris
of Ingland. For oftimes we find innocent pepyll and passingeris murdryst be the
theuis for sobir geir in their vaiage. And it their displeseiris ar bot small in
respect of other crueltris and iniuris done be their theuis. Quhen they ar
gaderit, they birn the cuntre, and slay is the commonis, quhilkis may nocht
resist thaym, with money other cruelteis mair insufferabyll to ws, than any
uncouth weiris, howbeit the samyn be nocht done sa opinly. Attour the slauchter
and heirschippis maid be uncouth weris, ar nocht sa miserabyll and unworthy to
be rehersit, as their cruelteis done be strange theuis and tratouris. For in
every chance of battall is sum consyderatioun concerning the estait of all
pepyll. Bot their bludy fleschouris and theuis makis heirschippis and slauchter
but any mercy quhare they cum. And thairfore the prudence of this nobil prince
in dantyng of sic strange lyminaris was mair to be commendit, than to have slane
money thowsandis of uncouth ennymes.

Sic thyngis done king Wyllia^ send his ambassatouris to king Hary desyryng
Northumberland (as before) to be restorit to him, certifying gyf the samyn war
nocht done with favor, it should be takin be force of battall. King Hary seand
that he (...) other to leif Northu^birland, or ellis to fecht with se^ battall
aganis the scottis, be auise of his noblis restorit king Wyllyam to sa mekyll
of Northumbirland as was inhabit before be Malcolme his gudschir. King Wyllyam
thocht nocht the samyn to be refusit, howbeit he wald nocht ^^it the rycht that
he had to ye hail landis. And it king Hary with in few years after was penitent
of yis contract. And to recover the said landis he persuadit the residew of
Northumbrianis (quhilkis stude under his empire) to provoke the scottis be
frequent heirschippis to battall, yat he mycht have sum occasioun to inuaid the
scottis and recover the landis of Huntyngtoun, Cumbir, and Northumberland to
his empire. Als sone as yir iniuris and heirschippis war maid on the scottis,
the wardan of the scottis bordour desirit restitution. And because na thing was
done according to Justice, the wardanis rasit great cumpanyis and maid
heirschippis and slauchter on athir side. it because king Hary was these time in
France, and the corn to be won, they wa^ content on all sydis to defend their
awin but any forthir invasion of other quhill the nixt eir. In the nixt symer
king Wyllyam come with ane army in Cumbir, the rycht wyng was geuyn to
Gilcrist, quhilk for his singular manheid and virtew prouyn oftymes in the
time of king Malcolme had maryit his sister. Ye left (...) was geuyn to ane
cous^^g of the ^yngis namyt Rowland. In the myddyl ward was king William. Quh^^
ye scottis war arraying (...) in this manner, king Hary send ane herald to king
Wyllyam desiring him to ska^^l his army but any (...) inuasioun, and he to
redres all expensis maid ^e his weres. King Wyllyam answerit that he rasit
nocht hes army for desire of money, nor it gaif the first occasioun of battal,
bot was ay content to have leiffit on his awin. And forthir he was nocht sa
inhumane nor desyrus of blude, bot he wald gladly skaill his army, sa that the
landis (quhilkis pertenit to him be just heritage) war restorit. At last quhen
king Wyllyam had waistit all Cu^bir, he come to Anwyk in Northumbirland quhare
he abaid money dayis to have had battall of Ingland. In the mean time the
Inglismen lay sa clois togydder but any noyis ordyn, yat na scottisme^ knew
quhare they war. King Wyllyam irkit with lang residence at Anwik, and seand na
ennimes appear, maid him before his returning in scotland to do sum notabyll
vassalage, and send al his army heir and their with may awful and weirly
incursionis throw the cuntre, and left none bot ane few nowmer of pepyl with
him self to their returnyng. Incontinent ane buschement of Inglismen come on
him with anseneis of Scotland and war nocht suspeckit for Inglismen, quhyll
(...) king was circulit with thaym (...) side. and fynaly taken away or any
Scottisman wy^^ saif only ane few cumpany quhilkis war left (as said is) with
him for the time. King Wyllyam was taken on this wise at Anwyk the xiii. day of
July, the.x. eir of his regne. Fra the Incarnatioun a^e thousand ane
hundred.lxxiiii. eris. Not lang eftir he was brocht to king Hary as prisonere
in Norma^^y. And nochtwithstandyng this trubyl that fell to king Willyam (because
na slauchter was maid at his taking) the weris continewit still betuix Ingland
and Scotland. Quhill at last peace was maid under their conditionis during the
captivity of king Wylliam, Northumbirland sall remane under the dominion of
Inglismen. And Cumber and Huntingtoun sal remane as before under the empire of
scottis.

How sanct Thomas of Cant^^bury was martyrit. how king VVillia^ was
redemit. How Gilbert defendit the liberte of scotland aganis ye paipir ligat.
of sindry meruellis. and how the abbayis of Abi^brothok and Hadingtoun was
foundit. Ca. v.
AT this time Thomas bischop of Cantorbury (quhilk was ^anis^ before for his
obstinat mind in defense of the liberte of haly kirk) was recunsaled to king
Hary be requeist of sindry great princis. bot this recou^saling succedit to his
great damage. for within schort time eft king Hary richt impacient to sustene
ye hatrent within his breist, quhilk he had consauit aganis sa^ct Thomas send
his familiaris and houshald men namit Wyllyam Bretoun, Hew Mo^well, Willyam
Trace, and Reginald Fittis. and finaly slew this haly bischop at the mes within
his kirk of Cantorbury before the hie alter of sanct Benedict upon the sext day
follow^ng ye natiuite of Crist. The eir nixt following king Hary returning out
of Ireland) after that he had put it to great affliction, for rebellion aganis
his empire) arriuit in Normandy and com to ye cathedral kirk of Ro^^ne, quhare
he be solemn aith p^rgit him of the slauchter of sanct Thomas, and it within
few dayis (...) he become sa penitent, that he (...) in his lynnyng (...) to
the sepulture of sanct Thomas, and (...) salt teris askit (...) for his (...).
The third (...), and eskit to ye nowmer of sa^ctis. In this eir apperit ane
meruellous stern standing still in the went both day and nycht with money other
sternis about the samyn. Quhen ye unhappy chance of king Wyllya^ was diuulgat
throw the realm, his brothir David earl of Lewcester be license of king Hary
come in scotland to govern the realm quhil^ his brothir war redemit. Als sone
as he had stabyllit the realm in good Justice* he send Richard bischop of sanct
Andros with money other noblis in Normandy to king Hary and maid king Wyllyamis
r^nsoun under this manner. King Wyllyam sal pay ane hundredth thousand poundis
striueling for his redemption, the taken half to be payit with argent content.
And for sickir payment of this other half he sal geif Cumber, Huntingtoun, and
Northumbirland under ane reuersioun, ay and quhil the residew of his ransoun
war payit to ye king of Ingland. Attoure king Wyllyam sall move na weir aganis
Ingland for retention of their landis fra his empire. And for the mair securite
of yis premissis, four of ye strange^^ castellis within scotland, yt is to say
Berwik, Edinburgh, Roxburgh, and (...) salbe delyuerit in Inglisme^nis ha^dis.
Sic things done followit new trubyll in scotland. for G^l^^r^ of Galloway ane
cruel and ane unhappy man tuk purpos to conque^ the croun, and (...) slauchter
and heirschippis a^ all y^me that (...) kirkis of Ingland. Als sone as he had
refourmit yame, he come in scotland, and summond all ye bischoppis thairof to
Northamptoun. Eft their conuentioun he began to persuade thaym with lang
orisoun to obey to ye archebischop of ork. Saying al other realms had ane
bischoppe to heir their complayntis yt yai mycht eschew great expensis and
laubouris in deuoluyng their causis to Rome. And because na metropolitan kirk
was in scotland (quhair they mycht conuene to their consultatioun) best was to
obey to the archebischop of ork. For be that way they mycht eschew surfeit
expensis, hauand decision of yair actionis with esy process be their superior.
To this answerit Gilbert ane oung man of great eruditioun, quhilk was send be
the king to suffir na thing to be done prejudicial be this cardinal to his
realm. And said in this manner. Scotland (sen it first tuke ye faith of Crist)
was neuir subdewit to na other bischop. Bot allanerlie to Cristis vicar. And
thairfore it was ane thing rycht vnreasonabil to these cardinal to desire ye
Scottis to be subdewit to Inglismen, considering ilk ane of thaym hes weir
perpetually with other. Howbeit it apperit more honest to treit concord or
peace amang thaym, than to gif occasioun of battall. Attoure na thing was done
be the bischoppis of Scotland worthy to deprive thaym of thayr liberte. And gif
any wranges were done in Scotland, they mycht be decidit sufficiently within the
realm be civil or prudent men. And gif any great chargis occurrit, they be
decidit be the king. For their and siclik reasonis, he desyrit our haly fader
the paip, to thirl nocht ye realm of Sotland to any Jurisdiction or empire of
ennymes, considering it neuir offendit to his sait. Because this Gilbert
defendit so weill the liberte of Scotland, he was maid bischop of Caithnes. And
for his haly life he was eikit to ye noumer of sanctis. Sindry meruellis were
seen this eir in Albioun. On mydsymerday callit the natiuite of sanct Iohne the
^aptist, was sic vehement schour of hail, that it slew money small bestial. The
pepill (that were out of housis) in yis mean time were strikin at erd be violence
of the samyn. In September the son obscurit of his lycht at noun two houris but
any eclipse or interposition of cluddis. In orkschire was sa great thundir with
uncouth flammys, that money abbayis and kirkis were brynt be the samyn. Not lang
eftir this time was biggit the abbay of Abirbrothok of the ordour of sanct
benidict dedicat to sa^ct Thomas of Canterbery, and dotat be king William may
richely, fra our redemptioun.i.M.i.C.lxxviii. eris. The samyn time ye abbay of
Haddingtoun was foundit be Adama queen king Williamis mother quhilk deceissit

How pape Alexander send to king William ane rose full of balm. How
Gilcrist vve^ dish^rist for ye slauchter of his wife. Of great cruelteis done
be turkis to cristin pepill. How king William dantit ye theuis. and tuke
Gilcrist in favor. Ca. vi.
SChort time eftir king William send ambassatouris to make his obedience to paip
Alexander ye third. Ye paip sone eftir send to king William ane gold^n rose,
full of balm with sindry new priuilegis concerning ye liberte of haly kirk. Ye
samyn time Gilcrist slew his wife for suspitioun yat he had aganis his of
adultry. King William mouit with yis contemptioun banist him out of scotland.
And kest down his house to the ground. This Gilcrist had ane brothir namyt
Bredus, quhilk before this trubil gat ye landis of Ogiluy. Of quhome the
Ogiluyis tuke yair beginning. At yis time king Hary gart rander the castle of
Edinburgh b^ request of the bischop of Durame to king William. This William
eftir deith of his first wife maryit Emengarda doucht to ye earl of Bewmont,
quhilk was gottyn on king Williamis the bastard of Normand^ (...) sister. Be
this marriage and (...) the peace was roborat betuix scotland and Ingland in sic
manner, that nane of yame mycht resset other rebellis within their realms. Thus
was Gilcrist (quhilk was banist a^ore in Ingland for his wyffis slauchter)
constranit to return in Scotland, quhare he and his two sonnys (...) lang time
ane miserable life, unknown for their pure habites to any pepill amang ye
woddis and co^is of the cuntre. At this time the Soldane inuadit the haly land
with heavy weris. And recouerit Jerusalem with money other townis, quhilkis were
that time under dominioun of cristin men. So far enragit the cruelte of this
Soldane, that he culd nocht be sac^at with blude of cristin pepill. For be him
were slane xxx.M. futmen.i.M. two hundredth horsemen. Sic as were bischoppis
prelatis and maisteris of hospitalis. Ye ^ame of their miserabill calamiteis
(quhen yai were diuulgat) maid the pepill to lament with sorrowful murnyng.
Attoure incredible noum^^ of nobill men were haldyn in captivity, quhilkis send
yair freindis to al cristin princis for support to their redemptioun, and schew
the misery and displeseiris that they sufferit. Their townis segit and their
self brocht to captivity, quhais infinite sorowis were sa importable that they
mouit every pepill to miseration and teris. King Hary mouit be their
insufferabill cruelteis done to cristin pepill* promittit to cum haistly with
ane army to their support. Bot his purpos was impeschit be sindry trublis,
quhilk followit in his realm. For his son Hary (quhilk was crounyt be him
before) conspirit be assistence of sindry princis of his realm to put him fra
the croun. Thus was he co^stranit to ceis fra his hailsum purpos. At yis time
king William come in Ros, and punist Makulene and Makbenne with money other
wekit lymmaris of the Ilis. Sic thingis done, king William come to Abirbrothok,
and co^man^it the craft^sme^ to ceis not for expensis, that it micht rise with
may magnificence to the honor of god. At his returnyng to the castle of
Bertha, he saw be adventure Gilcrist with his two sonnis, castand scherattis for
their meit, nocht knawing quhat they were. For they were disgisit. Nochtheles he
had great meruell that sa plesand oung men (as they apperit) were occupyit with
sic vile laubour. Incontinent Gilcrist with his beld heid fell on kneis before
him, and said. Gif any mercy be for tynt men in ye may reuthful prince, quhen
they ar punist condignely for their offense. I beseik the for the luf that
crist had to all sinful pepil, quhen he sparit nocht to sched his precious
blude for their redemption to have piete and reuth on me, and their my miserable
sonnis, quhilkis hes sufferit great displescir with me but any crime ^e thaym
co^mittit. At last quhen king William had inquiri^ him quhat he was, and how he
was brocht in sic misery, the teris fell sa fast fra his ene with ythand
sychis, that he mycht nocht schaw lang time quhat he was. At last he said, I am
Gylcrist may unhappy and sorrowful creature in erd, quhilk (alace) put my
handis in thy blude, and was thairfore disherist of all my landis, and exilit
in Ingland with their my two sonnis. And because I mycht nocht suffer the
schamefull iniuris done to me be Inglismen, obieckand daily the great felicite
that I had sum time to my derisioun. And als for the lawis maid laitly aganis
outlawis of aithir realms I was constranit to cum heir with my sonnis, quhare
we leif on the rutis of herbis in symer, and castis scherettis (as thou seys)
to sustene our liffis in the winter. Heirfore gif any reuth or piete be in thy
(...), or gyf thy indignatioun be mesit be lang time byrun, have mercy on our
sorrowful life, and remyt ws our offense. For we desire nocht to be restorit
to our heritage and honor, Bot allanerly to thy favor and grace. And gyf
thou will condescend heirto, thou sall not only conques great honor and fame
be exemple of piete, bot be ane renownit prince amang all pepyl. And wyn great
merit before god. Schawyng thy self the followar of Christ, the geuar of mercy
and peace. The king mouit be their wourdis and remembryng the great manheid
(quhylk he had sa often prouyn before at syndry Ieoperdyis for the honor and
commoun weill of scotland) and seeing him deieckit fra great honor in supreme
myserie* nocht only remyttit all his offense, bot pe^uisly embrasit him in his
armies, and commandit him to be of gu^ comfort. Syne gaif him horse and money to
follow him to Forfair, quhare he restorit him and his two sonnis to all their
landis, except sa mekyll as war geuyn before be king Wyllyam to the abbay of
Abirbrothok. After this Gylcryst perseuerit in good faith and obeisance to the
king. And because his eldest son deceissit but any airis, and his other son
vnabyll to mary, he gaif mekyll of his heritage to Abirbrothok. After his deith
his son was of na les deuotioun, for he gaif the resydew of his landis to the
said abbay. And thairfore Gylcryst and his two sonnis ar buryit in the said
abbay before sanct Katherynis alter, as their superscription schawis. And
youcht king Wyllyam was geuyn in this wise to the byggyng of the said abbay, it
he left na thing undone that micht pertene to ane good prince, and gouernit his
realm in Justice, Geuand his engyne to reward all good men, and virtewis
personis, and to punys lymmaris. He maid syndry lawis to punys theuys and
oppressouris of the cuntre, quhylkis war ouir prolixt to put in this buke.

How king VVyllyam recouerit his landis. How Rychard king of Ingland and
Philip king of France went with great armyis in Iovvry* of their vassalage and
trubyll. How earl David returnit out of the haly land and foundit Lundoris.
Ca. vii.
QUhyll sic thyngis war done in Scotland, king Hary the empress son deceissit
in Ingland. To quhome succedit his son Richard. For Hary hes first son was
deceissit. King Richard eftir his coronatioun full of curage and spreit,
gaderit ane strange army to pas in the haly land, and maid peace with all his
nychtbouris, that na trubill should follow in his realm be his absence. Before
his Iornay he rande^it Berwik, Roxburgh and Striuelyng to king William with sa
mekil of Northumbirland as was taken fra him before in this last battall at
A^wik. He gaif ouir all the landis of Cumbir and Huntyngtoun under their
co^ditionis. The munitionis and strenthis thairof sall remane under his
capitanis. And the remanent landis thairof to be inhabit be the scottis.
Attoure to have the more benevolence of scottis, he dischargit ye ^^sidew of
king Williamis ranson except.x.M. poundis, quhilkis he tuke allanerly to
support his weris. And quhen king William had resa^it al his landis and
castellis on yis manner, he maid his brothir David ^rle of Huntyngtoun. And send
him with.v.M. men to support king Richard in his weris. King Richard left his
brothir Iohne governor of England to his returnyng, and maid his sister son
Arthure duk of Normandy to be heritour to ye croun of Ingland faileing
succession of him and his brothir. Nocht lang eftir king Richard come with money
nobil men, dukis, erlis, baronis, to massilia ane port of Prouance, quhare he
pullit up salis with ane hundredth and.l. schippis to pas to Jerusalem. Fra our
redemptioun ane thousand ane hundredth.lxxxxi. eris. On ye samyn manner Phillip
king of France come out of the port of Ianis with money nobill men spiritual
and temporal. And arriuit at Achon ane strange town of Iowry, quhilk was that
time under the empire of sarazenis. And beltit y^ samyn with strait sege.
Quhill king Phillip was lyand thus at the sege of Achon, King Richard arriuyt
in the I Will of Cipre, and tuke purpos (or he went any for that) to purge ye
samyn of Cristis ennymes. Sone eftir he displayit his baner and come with
bludye swerd throw the said I Will. And finalie tuke the king of Cipre with his
douchter presoneris. And quhen he had deliuerit this I Will to cristin pepil, He
pullit up salis to meit king Phillip at Achon, and be adventure met ane flot of
sarazenis be ye gait, quhilkis were cumyng in support of the said town. And
eftir lang and terrible bergane he sank ane large part of the sarazenis under
seis. And ye remanent put to flycht. Syne went forthwart to king Phillip. The
sege continewit lang time at yis town throw ye great defense that ye sarazenis
maid with the samyn. Howbeit the vter wallis were brokin in sindry partis be
force of rammis and other instrumentis of cheualry. At last king Phillip fell
in sic infirmite, that he was constranit to return in France. Nochttheles king
Richard determit nocht to depart fra the sege of Achon, quhill the samyn were
expugnat. In the mean time hapnit ane Scot namyt Oliver to be in the said town.
For he was banist before out of scotland and fled to ye sarazenis. And be lang
conuersatioun with thaym he had their perfect langage, nane of yame knawing
quhat he was. This Oliver was yan sodiour in ane toure of this town quhare na
trinschis nor out wallis were beond ye samyn. He happinnit be adventure to se
amang ye wache of earl David of Huntington ane of hes kinnisme^ namit Iohne
Durward, with quhome he was la^g time before acquentit. And incontinent he cryit
on him be name desyryng under assurance to commoun with him. After certane
co^monyng this Olyuer set ane hour to geif entres to earl David with all his
army in the town, sa that earl David wald restore him to his land and heritage
in scotland. The hour set, earl David come with ane great power of me^ to the
toure before rehersit, quhare he gat enteres with his army. And incontinent with
great noyis and clamoure he come throw the town to ye great slauchter of all
pepyll foundyn in it. King Richard seand on the morrow the scottis standart on
the wallis, enterit in the town. And within schort time after brocht ane great
castle (quhilk stude nocht far fra this town) to rewyne. Attoure he had rane
money other great townis and strenthis of Iowry, quhylk war takyn before fra
cristin men be cruelte of sarazenis. War nocht ane wyckit contentioun raise
betuix Inglismen and Franche men for desire of honouris. At last quhen king
Rychard had dystroyit this town of Achon, and was returnand in Italy, ane
suddane tempest seuerit his navy. Throw quhilk he was destitute of freindis,
and fynaly be treasoun of certane evil cristin men he was brocht to Hary
empryoure. The schip (that earl David was in till) be regeand tempest was sa
brokin, yat money of thaym (quhilkis war in her) perist, and he narrowly
eschapit with his life. After this he was taken be the inhabitantis of this land
and brocht to Alexandria, quhare he was haldyn lang time in preson. Quhyll at
last he was cost be marchandis of Uenice, and brocht to Constantinople. Nocht
lang after he was brocht to Uenis, quhare he was redemit be merchandis of
Ingland and brocht to Flanderis. And their he pullit up salis to return in
Scotland. And (quhen he was little departit fra the land) he was dreuyn be
unmercifully tempest nocht far fra Norroway and Scheitland with incredybyll
dangeir. Finaly quhen he had maid ane voit to byg ane kirk in the honor of
the virgyne Mary, gif he war fortunat to eschape the dangeir of Seis, he
arryuit in Tay beside Dunde, not far fra sanct Nicholas chapel but any rudder
or taikyll, and gaif thankis to god and the blyssyt virgyne for delyueryng of
him fra sic extreme peril. The place (quhare he arriuit) was callit Allectum.
Bot after his cummyng it changit name and was callid Dunde, quhilk sig^ifyis in
our langage the gift of god. King Wyllyam heirand the returnyng of his brothir

that delyuerit his brothir fra sa money dangeris. After these he gart maik

In the quhylk license was geuyn to earl David to byg ane abbay in quhat place

King Wyllyam gaif money priuilegis to Dunde, quhilkis induris to their dayis.
David nocht refusyng ye benevolence of his brothir, byggit ane abbay callit
Lundoris after the ordour of sanct Benedict. Ane thing is their richt
meruellus, na man is hurt in that abbay with eddaris. Their eddaris lyis in the

Howbeit na man gettes skaith yair of. For we have seen ^oung barnis play amang

How king Richard returni^ in Ingland. How king VVyllyam punist great ^ymmaris
in his realm. Of the na^iuite of prince Alexander. Of the coronatioun of king

King Richard schort time after was redemit with sa huge money, that mekyl of
all the silver and goldyn vessel of England was cuneit for his redemptioun. Thus
was he fynaly delyuerit and ^essauit in Ingland with great triumph. King
Wyllyam heirand the returnyng of king Richard in England come with his brothir
earl Da^id to London, and gaif to him two thousand mark striuelyng, For he had
waistit all his money be payment of his ransoun and weris. Be their humaniteis
followit great amite and tenderness betuix the two kingis. In ye mean time king
Wyllyam f^ll in great infirmite within Ingland, and because the pepyll beleuit
his deith, raise great trubyll in all partis of scotland. For sindry lymmaris
tra^^ing all Justice to expire be his deith, inuadit the pepyll with
heirschippis and slauchter in all partis. Nocht lang after king Wyllyam
conualescit of his infirmite and returnit in Scotland with sic deligence that
money of yir limmaris war taken and punist effering to their demeritis. The
principal mouar namit Herald was brocht to the king, first his ene was put out,
syne he was geldit and hyngit after upon ane gallous. Attoure all his freindis
war geldit on the samyn manner, that na succession should follow of thaym in times
cummyng. In the eir following was mair derth tha^ euir was seen before. for the
boll of beir mycht scarsly be coft for.v. cronis. And in the nixt eir (quhilk
was fra the incarnation ane thousand ane hundred nynte and nine) was mair
abundance and plente than euir was hard before. In this eir king Wyllyamis wife
namit Arma^ga^da was delyuerit of prince Alexander. The samyn eir king Richard
of Ingland deceissit, to quho^ Iohne his brothir succedit. The.iii. eir
following Alexander was maid prince of scotland. The samyn eir was send ane

scheith of gold* set with money precious stanis. This legate als presentit ane
bonat of tire maid in manner of Diadem of purpoure hew, to signify that he was
defendar of the faith. At this time money ^indultis and priuilegis war gra^tit
be the paip for ye libe^te of haly kirk in scotland. It was co^mandit be king
Wyllya^ ye saturday salbe haldyn halyday fra.xii. houris forth at none, quhilk
sall be schawin to the pepyll be sound of bell, and na profane laubouris to be
exercit fra that time forth quhil Monunday. And the pepyll to perseu^ir

found rebelland thairto.

How king VVyllyam and king Iohne war confiderat togydder be marriage. Of king
VVyllyamis haly life and liberalite to the kirk. How the town of Perth tuk

After this king Willyam returnit to London to make his homage for the landis
of Northumbirland Cumbir, and Huntingtoun. Als sone as he had maid his homage,
king Iohne desirit him to pas with him in France aganis king Philip. And because
he refusit (for the band that his eldaris maid before with France) king Iohne
clamit agane his landis foresaid, and tuk ane great nowmer of guddis out of the
samyn in manner of po^nd for ye proffet bygane. Nochtheles the nobyllis of
Ingland knawing rycht dyffycyll to have weir both with France and Scotland
atanis, causit all the saidis guddis to be redressit. In the eir followyng was
sa vehement frost in Scotland, that na pluch micht be put in the land before the
myddis of March. Attoure the aill was sa frosyn, that it was sald be pound
wechtis. after quhilk followit ane huge snaw to the great mortalite of bestyall.
Als ane continewall trymblyng and erd quaik followit fra the Epiphany day to
Februar. After this winter, king Iohne endit his weris on France. And to have
occasioun of battall aganis ye Scottis, he began to byg ane castle fornens
Berwyk. King Wyllyam aduertist heirof, send his ambassatouris to king Iohne
desiring him to se^k na occasioun of battall, and to b^g na strenthis fornens
him* and because he gat nocht bot repuls of hes desiris, he come with ane great
power and kest down ye said castle. King Iohne to revenge their iniuris, rasit
ane army to cum in Scotland. And king Wyllyam to preuene his travel come to
the bordouris. it quhe^ both the armyis war reddy to fecht, they war seuerit
be interuention of prudent men. Finaly both ye armyis skalit, and the two
kyngis come to ork. quhare peace and amite was roborat betuix thaym under their
conditionis, King Wyllyamis two douchteris namit Isobell and Margaret sal mary
two sonnis of king Iohne namit Hary and Rychard* to that fine. Gif ane deit,
the tothir sall succeid to the crown of Ingland. For quhilkis king Wyllyam sal
geif sufficient drowry. Attour the castle (yat was cassyn down laitly be king
william) sal remane in ye samyn manner neuir to be edifiit in times cumyng. In
the plege of Towquhare and obseruatioun of al their premises, nine nobyll men
of scotland salbe delyuerit to king Iohne. In this conuentioun king wyllyam
resignit the landis of Northumbirland, Cumbir, and Huntingtoun in the handis of
king Iohne, that his son prince Alexander micht be sesit thairintyll. For
siclik consuetude was obseruar in iosing of their landis be Scotland, yat they
should be haldyn of the king of Ingland, and homage to be maid to him and his
successouris be all scottis kingis y^ iosit and brukit yame for y^ time. After
yt their two kingis wa^ at their counsal at ork was brocht to thaym ane child of
great bewte, he ritour to sindry landis of Ingland. bot he was trublit with
meruellus infirmite, For ane of his ene was consumit be flux of evil humouris,
his hand pynit away, and had na power of his tongue, nor it his ta side. The
medcynaris seeing him have sic contrarius infirmiteis and nocht knawing ye cause
thairof, iugit him incurabyll. Nochtheles king Wyllyam maid ane croce on him
and restorit him incontinent to his heill. Syndry beleuit th^^ done be miracle
of god, that the virtew of this nobyl man sall nocht be hyd nor unknown to the
pepyl. Nocht lang after king Wyllya^ returnit in scotland and dotat the kirkis
of Newbottell, Melros, Dunfermelyng, and (...) with sindry landis. He fou^dit
ane new bischoprik callit Argyle with landis sufficient to sustene the samyn.
Sic thingis done king Wyllyam went to the castle of Bertha. And within schort
dayis after the ^atter of Tay and Almond raise with sa terrybyll inundatioun and
preis, that it brak ye wallis of Bertha and drownit money of the pepyl that was
in it. And yocht king Wyllyam narowly eschapit with hes wife, barnis, and
freindis. it his oung son na^it Iohne perist with his nurice and (...) personis
that dependit on him for the time. Thus raise na les dolor and lamentation,
than is ^^th the pepyll quhen their towns ar ^ane with ennymes. For the preis
of rage and watteris apperis to me mair terribyll and dangerus, ^han any fire.
For the fire increissis with small beginning, and schawis sa sone y^ self that
it inuadis the pepyl mair ^n their guddis tha^ in their bodyis. and is sone
slokin quhare men ar deligent. Be contrar no wit nor delygence of man may
resist the inundatioun of watteris. for it enteris at duris and windowis with
sic violence, that na remeid is aganis it, bot gyf ane man find haistely
schyppis or baittis. And quhen sic thyngis can nocht be gottin, yocht the
pepyll pas to the hicht of the house, it they ar nocht saiffit be that way. For
ye watter gangis above their heidis, and pu^tis thaym to miserabyll deith. Thus
ar sindry houssis (quhilkes stude on land) nocht bot seyis. King William seand
the castle of Bertha distroyit be inundatioun of watter in this wise, foundit
the town quhilk was callit eftir Perth be ane man of that name, quhilk gaif
the ground quhare this town was biggit. King William to cause the samyn rise in
honor and riches gaif sindry preuilegis thairto. Bot now this town is callit
sa^ct Iohnestoun and was fou^dit fra our redemption ane.M.ii.C. and.x. eris.

How king Iohne subdevvit Ireland and VValis. How king VVyllyam punist sindry
conspiratouris. How England and Ireland war maid tributaris to ye paip. Of
king VVyllyamis deith. and how syndry ordouris of freris began. Ca. x.
THe eir followyng king Iohne of Ingland subdewit ye may part of Ireland to
his empire, and the ni^^ eir he subdewit all Walis. The samyn time raise in
Caithnes great trubyll* For Gothred son of Makculem (quhais rebellyon was
schawin before) maid great heirschippis in Ros and syndry other bou^dis
thairabout. His cumpany incressit ylk day mair, be assistence of syndry
lymmaris of Lochquhaber and Ilis. To punis their attemptatis king william send
the erlis of Fyf, Atholl, and Buchquhane with.vi.M. men. and they be set
battall vincust the said Gothred and brocht him presoner to ye king, quhom he
gart heid with money otheres quhilkes war brocht to him on ye samyn manner. At this
time raise ane great dissensioun betuix king Iohne of Ingland and paip Innocent
the third as after followis. King Iohne tuk be general exaction the tent penny
of al landis and frutis pertenand to the kirk, and punist thaym y^ war
repugnant thairto, with may cruelte, and because certane abbayis and
bischoprikis within his realm war nocht obeysant. He tuk possession of all
their landis, and nocht only reft fra thaym all their gold, silver, and
Iowellis, bot banist the religious me^ thairof. Paip Innocent traista^d sic
cruelteis nocht semand to cristin princis (yat other princis should nocht inuaid
the kirk with siclik avarice) persuadit king Iohne money wayis to desist fra
their extorsionis, and to redres all iniuris done be him to ye kirk. And because
he couth na way divert his mind fra the samyn, he denuncit him cursit and
depriuit him (sa far as he micht) of al honor and dignite, makand inuocatioun
to all cristin princes to cum with their armyis aganis him for defense of the
liberte of haly kirk. King Iohne seand him of na pyssance to resyst sa money
armyis deuysit aganis him in all partis feneit him penitent. And to have
absolutioun for the offense that he had committit aganis the kirk, he gaif ouir
the realms of Ingland and Ireland to paip Innocent to pay eirly, quhyll.vii.
eris war gone.x. thousand markis striuelyng to the paip and his successouris
for the realms of Ingland and Ireland. Quhilk pensioun is eirly payit to our
dayis. Sic thingis done king Iohne and his realm was assoyleit fra all
censuris led aganis thaym. Schort time after king Wyllyam brokyn with lang age
deceissit at Striueling the.xlix. eir of his regne. Fra our redemptioun ane
thousand two hundred.xiiii. eres, and was burijt in Aberbrothak before the hye
alter. The eir before his deith two cometis apperit in the month of March
richt terribyll to the sicht of pepyll, that ane schane ay before the son
risyng, and this other before his down falling. In the nixt eir ane calf was
seen in Northumberland with heid and crag like the awin nature, and the
remenant like the nature of ane horse. In the nixt winter was seen two mones in
the lift, seuerit fra other, and hornit naturally as the moon vsis to be in her
incressing or wainding. In the time of king Wyllyam war money nobyll clerkis. As
Dominicus spaneart channoun of saint Augustinis ordoure, quhilk sone after left
the samyn and began the ordour of freris callit predicatouris. And in this time
was sanct Francis, quhilk began the ordouris of freir minouris callit gray
freris, of quhom money abbayes ar now rychely byggit in all partis of the world.
At this time was Ioachim abbot of Calaber, quhilk wrait the co^mentaris in the
bukis of apocalipsis. That ylk time was Rodulphe archebyschop of Culane, quhilk
brocht the bodyis of three kyngis out of Pers to Constantinople, and after that
in Culane, quhare they remane now in great veneratioun of the pepyll. The samyn
time Peter Comestor wrait the hystory ecclesiastik. Amang ws war in they dayis
syndry haly men, as Udward byschop of Brechin. Eustachius abbot of Arbroth,
quhilkis war excellent precheouris. King Wyllyam foundit the abbay of
Balmernocht bot it was dotat be Emengard his wife, and about these time war
institute y^ monkis of the Trinite callit the redemptioun of captiuis. Two of
yame war send in scotland be paip Innocent. To quhome king Wyllyam gaif hes
palyce ryall in Aberdene to big yair abbay, and was of purpos to geif thaym
syndry other thyngis gyf he had leuit.

Of king Alexander the secound and his actis. How king Iohne of Ingland
inuadit the kirk with great exactionis* How the paip and kirkmen war
corruppit be his money to assist to his opinioun. How king Alexander renevvit
the band of France. and of the deith of king Iohne. Ca. xi.
King Wyllyam deceissit in this wise, his son Alexander the secound was crownit
at Scone. After his coronation he went to Ahirbrothok, quha^e he remanit.xiiii*
dayis doing funeral obsequies for king Wyllyam his fader, and co^mandit na
playis nor bankettes to be vsit for ane eir to cum, that the pepyl micht lament
ye deith of his fader with publik doloure. The kingis seruandis war clothit in
dule weid all the eir followyng. The first conuentioun yat he maid was in
Edinburgh. quhare he ratifyit all thingis done be his fader. And after that he
had assignit certane landis to his mother to sustene her ryal estait, he
assignit certane Iugis to remane in all townis of his realm for decision of
dout sum materis and execution of Justice. At this time raise great discention
betuix king Iohne of Ingland and his nobyllis. For he was sa full of avarice
and birnand desire ^o conques guddis, that he wald admit na heritoure to their
landis, quhill he had for their enteres the just valor of their heritage for
ane eir. He tuk erely pensionis fra abbottis and byschoppis contrar the liberte
of haly kirk. And quhe^ any prelate deceissit, he tuk all the rentis of the
place quhil the successoure enterit. The prelatis of Ingland richt impacient to
suffer sic exactionis, solistit syndry great princes to rise aganis the king.
And finaly dressit yair purpos with sic menes, yt both ye kings of France and
scotland promittit to cum in Ingland to their support. King Iohne heirand sic
rebellyoun maid aganis him, to eschew the present dangeir maid aggreance with
his prelatis, and promittit be his great aith to repare al iniures done be him.
Howbeit na thing thairof followit in effect. For he was sa blindit with
avarice. yat he returnit to his evil maneris. And send his ambassatoures to
Gawlo ane cardinal of Rome, complaning the violence of his subdittis aganis
him. Quhilkis be yair menis hes persuadit the kingis of France and Scotland to
invade him in sic manner, that he may nocht govern his realm in liberte. Pape
Innocent (bebecaus he had ane eirly pension of king Iohne) was the mair
co^mouit at this complaynt, and promittit to debait him with may favor. In
they days war (as their is now) may auaritious pepyll in the court of Rome.
And thairfore every thing was grantit that mycht bring any importance to thaym
but sicht to reason or conscience. Amang al sic inordinat personis, nane was
mair vicious nor couatus than Gwalo. for he pretermittit na thing vnsped to
king Iohne, quhare he mycht find any co^modite after followyng. Now will we make
ane digressioun, and se how far ye prelatis and kirkmen in auld times war above
the prelatis in our dayis in virtewis and syngular life. Of quhilkis the
prelatis now present beris nocht bot the name, na thing following their life.
For they auld faderis war geuyn to Imitatatioun of Crist in pouerte, piete,
humilite and Justice. Drawyng the pepyll be their fervent cherite and
continewal precheing in service of god. with equale affectioun to pure and
rich. Nocht arraying thaym with gold, silver, nor precious abuleme^tis. Nocht
using the court nor accu^panyit with weirmen and bordellis. Nocht contending to
exceid the lust and insolence of princes, nor doing na thing be dissait, bot
leuand with pure conscience and verite. Bot the prelatis and kirkmen in our
dayis ar rutit with ma vicis than ar seen with any other pepyl. Sic enorm^teis
hes rog^e perpetually in the kirk, sen riches was apprisit and ha^dyn in may
honor amang kirk men. King Iohne nochtwithstandyng his promise and obligatioun
maid before be his great aith (quhen he was aduertist be Gwalois writings
promitting to defend him in all materis) began to invade his nobyllis spretuall
and temporal with mair exactionis than he did before. Regarding na thing bot
only to conqueir guddis and riches. The nobillis rycht impacient to sustene
their extorsionis, solistit Lewis Dalphine of France, and Alexander king of
scotland to cu^ with great armyis in their support. King Iohne hauand little
confidence in his subdittis, fled to ane strenth. Throw quhilk Lewis come but
any obstakyll to London, quhare he was reslauit plesandly be the pepyll. After
this he send to king Iohne desiring him to abstene fra all exactionis, and
nocht to iniure hes pepyll in times cumyng with sic extorsionis, for sic
thingis makis princes both odious to their subdittis and to all other pepyll.
Attoure the said Lewis desirit king Iohne to redres all skaithis, quhilkis his
subdittis hes sufferit be his tyranny, and to keep his faith to thaym as before
promittit. And gyf he thocht sic thingis to be obseruat, to send his son with
other his nerest freindis to remane in pl^ge for observation thairof. King
Iohne hauand his confidence in na thing mair than in his money and in this
Gwalo cardinal before rehersit, wald heir na conditioun of peace, and said he
should nocht ceis quhill the attemptatis done be hes pepil war co^dignely punist.
Jews incontinent rasit his army with sindry Inglismen of his opinion to inuaid
king Iohne. Nochtheles he was consultit to superseid his passage, because the
samyn mycht succeid mair to publik damage of the cuntre tha^ punitioun on him,
that was the motive of all their trubyl. King Alexader heirand sic trubyll in
Ingland come with ane army to London but any damage done to the pepyl. Be
quhais cumyng al trubyl ceissit. For als sone as their two princis Alexander and
Lewis had co^monit betuix thaym of syndry materis pertenyng to their realms,
they went to king Phylyp in France, leuand behynd thaym.x.M. men to assist to
the lordis of England aganis king Iohne. Sone after king Philip and king
Alexander met togydder at Bolonie, quhare the band was renewit betuix Scotland
and France with all pointis after the auld manner. Sic thyngis done king
Alexander and Lewis returnit in Ingland. After quhais cumyng king Iohne tuk sic
malancoly, that he deceissit.

Of the general counsal haldin at Rome be paip Innocent. And how the kyngis
of Scotland and Ingland inuading aithir realms with great heirschippis and
slauchter. And how they war agreit. Ca. xi.
After deith of king Iohne, his son Hary was crounit* Quhil sic thingis war
done in Ingland, ane general counsall was at Rome. In the quhilk was.iiii.C.
and.xii. bischoppis. and.viii.C. abbotis. In this counsall paip Innocent cursit
all thaym that war ennymes to king Iohne of Ingland, and in special cursit
Lewis Dalphyn of France and Alexander king of scotland with all otheris of
their opinioun, alliegeand yame inuasouris of the liberte of Rome. Because
England was tributar to the paip. Schort time following Gwalo y^ auaritious
cardynal before rehersit, come in Ingland and cursit all yame that inuadit king
Iohne during his life, and interditit all placis quhare yai com. Lewis seand
the may part of Ingland assist to king Hary and Gwalo bocht ane absolutioun
with infinite money, syne returnit in France. Attoure this auaritious cardinal
cursed and interditit syndry great princes of Ingland, quhil they war constranit
to by yair absolutionis with infinite money. For he had na sicht to honest nor
dishonest actionis, bot allanerly to his proffet. Nocht lang after king Hary
come with ane army in Scotland inuading the cuntre with great slauchter and
heirschyppis quhare they come. Als sone as he was aduertist that king Alexander
was gaderit with all the power of Scotland to geif him battal, he fled with
great deligence in Ingland. Nochtheles king Alexander followit on him, and kest
down money castellis and stre^this of Northumbirland to ye ground. And after
that he had won Carlele and garnist it with folkis, he returnit with great
triumph and honouris in scotland. King Hary hei^ and yat king Alexander had
skailit his army, returnit with ane new power in scotland, and tuke both the
town and castle of Berwik. Syne brint and heriit all the sea camp to
Haddyngtoun, and sais^it nane yat was found be ye gait except wiffis, barnis,
and preistis, and returnit with his army in Ingland. In the mean time this
auaritious prelat Gwalo traisting to find sufficient oportunite to conques great
money in Scotland, put the ^amyn under process of interdictioun, and persewit
king Alexander (because he inuadit Ingland) with may terribyll cursingis. Their
cursing is infla^mit ye scottis with sic hatrent aganis Inglismen, that ye same
apperit not to ceis but vter exterminion of both their realms. Nochtheles be
interuention of prelatis, peace was fynaly maid betuix the two realms under
their co^ditionis. King Alexander sall rander to Inglismen ye town of Carlele.
And king Hary sall rander the town of Berwyk to scottis. The hail dominon of
Cumbir to remane with king Alexander with the half of Northumbirland to the
recroce, and king Alexander to be assoileit of all censuris led aganis him be
Gwalo. The two kyngis beand aggreit on this wise on al debaitis, king Alexander
was assoileit, and his realm delyuerit fra interdiction. Incontinent Gwalo
(that he sall not depart with tume hand) summond all ye prelatis of Scotland to
Anwik, hauand na actionis aganis thaym, bot only to trubyl yame, quhil they
have debursit large soumes of money to his profet. Sindry of thaym to be
exonerat of truble gaif him large money. Otheris refusit his desyris, and tuk
indignatioun, that sperituall materis were sa opinly sauld for money.
Inco^tine^t Gwalo su^mond yame to Rome beleuyng yai should tak sic feir for la^g
Iurnay and travel thairof, that yai should co^discend to his purpos. Nochttheles
they were litill affrayit their with. bot went finalie to ye paip, and complanyt
the insufferable iniuris done in Ingland and Scotland be Gwalo. Thus was Gwalo
finalie dischargit of all auctorite, and condampnit in great soumes of money to
the paip. All their prelatis (yat were su^mond be him to Rome) were assoleit fra
his petitioun. At this time David earl of Hu^tyngtoun deceissit. And was buryit
in ane abbay of Ingland namit Seuicia.

How king Hary and king Alexander were alliar be marriage. Of the translation
of sanct Thomas of Ca^terbery. Of sindry legatis send in Scotland be the paip
to conques money. Ca. xiii.
HAry king of England eftir his cumyng to ^erfite age was more desirus of peace
yan weir* Ane co^uention was maid betuix him and king Alexander at ork. In ye
quhilk the two kyngis were alliat togiddir in this manner. Jane sister of king
Hary was maryit on king Alexander. And ye two sisteris of king Alexander were
maryit on two great princes of Ingland. This alliance was maid fra our
redemption.i.M.ii.C.xx. eris. And in this eir was ye translatioun of sanct
Thomas of Canterbury done be ye king and his nobillis spiritual and temporal
with all solempnite and reverence yt mycht be deuisit. In the nixt eir ane legate
was send be ye paip in Scotland to purches money to furnis ane new army to pas
on ye turkis. And quhe^ he had gottin na litill money to this effect i^
scotland, he spendit it in hes lust and insolence. And said at his returnyng to
the paip that it was reft fra him be Brigandis. Schort time eftir his cumyng to
Rome, ane other legate was send to the samyn effect in scotland. King Alexander
aduertist before be his cumyng, conuenyt his noblis to ane cou^sal. in ye quhilk
ane bischop said to him as followis, howbeit sindry thingis presently occurris
(quhilkis effrayis me to schawe sic materis as been prejudicial to ye co^moun
weil) it (may nobil prince) quhen I co^sidir thy humanite, faith, and
co^stance geuin to na thing mair than defense and weil of thy liegis. I can
nocht ceis for the action of common liberte, to schaw ye suth. For (...) the
tyranny is intolerable, quhilk is exercit be kingis or princis discending of
lynial succession to yair kindly heritage, mekill mair is ye tyranny
insufferable, quhen it is exercit on ws be men of vile and obscure lynage.
Heirfore gif the sindry and manifest wrangis done to ws their money eris bigane,
had cu^^ be ye paiyis mind, yai were to be sufferit in sum manner. Bot sen
lymmaris of vile and obscure lignage (quhilkis ar promouit to be neficis for
their horrible vices) hes nocht only interditit our realm but any commission,
bot hes spendit i^ yair corruppit vices the money that they gaderit in our
cuntre be ye papis autorite for rasyng of armyis aganis the turkis. I think
their cursit avarice should have na forthir place ama^g true pepill, specially
amang ws, because they have our simplicite and meiknes in co^temptioun. The
eris before passait e complanit ye iniuris done be Gwalo, quhen he held our
realm interditit and money of al our prelatis under cursing, because they wald
not answer him of money to sustene his lusts. Attour this Gwalo was so
periolus fontane of al iniquite and vice, yat howbeit he was send to ^reit
concord betuix Inglismen and scottis. it be his avarice he gaif sic occasioun
of battall, that both the realms (were nocht yair hatrent was the more
haistely mesit) had inuadit other to their vter distructioun. And sen their
terrible dedis ar patent, quha^ nedis thaym to be remembrit to our displeseir.
Attoure eftir that we were exonerat of Gwalo, come in his place ane new legate of
na better life bot erar wors. For quhen he had got (...) large money fra ws for
redemptioun of presoneris and rasyng of new armyis aganis ye turkis, he spendit
it all in his insolence, and feneit yat it was ^eft be brigandis. Heirfore
(...) we have experience of sa money (...) and heavy da^magis done to ws be yir
two legatis before rehersit, we salbe reput mischant fulis to admit the third.
For it is not to be beleuit, that this new legate salbe of bett conditionis than
his fallowis was before. And gif any man list demand me quhat is to be done in
yis matter. I say nothir this legate, nor it na other legate in times cumyng should
be ressauit within this realm. Because the samyn is heryit and waistit of money
be their c^ntinewall exactionis, gif any of ow hes superflew money e may
dispone it erar to pure folk than to sic corrupit use of vicious ^egatis.
Finalie their wourdis were sa apprisit be the counsall, that this legate was nocht
admittit to cum in ye realm.

How king Alexander punist synd^y conspiratouris in his realm. And of ye
first cumyng of blak and gray frei^is in Scotland. Ca. xiiii.
THe peace robora^in manner forsaid, followit ane civil battal in Scotland be
motioun of Gilespy Ros. for he com with great army aganis the kingis auctorite,
and eftir that he had slane money of the kings liegis, he brint ye town of
Ennernes To punis yir attemptatis was send Iohne Cumyn earl of Buchquhane with
ane cumpany of chosyn men. And finalie slew the said Gil^spy with both his
sonnis, and brocht their heidis to the king. This trubill beand dantit (as said
is) followit ane other. For the men of Caithnes brint Adam yair bischop, eftir
yat he had cursit thaym for non payment of yair teyndis. King Alexandir heirand
si^ terrible cruelte done to this nobil prelat, ceissit nocht quhill.iiii.C. of
the principal doaris yairof were hingit. Attour yt na successioun sal cum of
this wickit seid, he gart geld yair sonnis. The place (quhare they were geldit)
is callit it the staney hill. Attoure (because the Earl of Caithnes maid na
support to bischop Adam) nor it tuke punitioun on their lymmaris that co^mittit
this cruelte, he was forfaltit of all his landis. King Alexander for this
punitioun was grerumly louit be ye paip. Sic thingis done king Alexander went
to Abirdene, and dotat it with money priuilegis. Howbeit the samyn was dotat
before with sindry co^moditeis be other kyngis. The bullis (quhilkes war grantit
be sindry p^ipis concerning the liberteis of the kirkis of scotland) were geuyn
in keeping to s^net Gilbe^t archeden of Murray, quhilk sucedit immediately to ye
sait of Caithnes eftir the slauchter of bischop Adam. In ye third eir eftir,
the earl of Caithnes come to king Alexander, Quhen he was sittand with his
modir on ye Epyphany day at his uyll and desirit grace. King Alexander was so
pieteous and reuthfull, yat he restorit him to his honouris, landis, and
possessionis be ane sobir compositioun of money. Nochttheles the offense that
was vnpunist be man, was sone eftir punist be great Justice of god. For he was
slane be his awin seruandis slepand in his bed. And the house (quhare he was
slane) brint, that na man should have suspitioun of his slauchter, bot as it were
cumyn be suddane aue^ture, and so he perist i^ ye samin manner as bischop Adam
did, of quhais deith he was participant. At yis time sindry blak freris were
send in scotland be sanct Dominik. It is said quhen king Alexander went in
France to renew the band of Scotland with king Philip, He prayit sanct Dominik
to send part of his freiris in Scotland to instruct the scottis. And thairfore
their freiris were plesandly ressauit and kirkis ereckit to their contemplatioun.
And youcht their men (quhilkis were send be sa^ct Dominik) leiffit (as they were
institute be him) in singular life, it (as oftymes hapnis) all thyngis fra good
begynn^^g fallis in wers maneris. All their successouris declinit fra good
religion in may insolence and lust, and continewit in vicious life.iii.c.

man of singular ^rudition and life, quhilk was professit in theology with ws
at Abirdene. On the samyn manner were send in scotland freir minouris of sanct
Francis ordour. Money of thaym in the same manner were sindry eris eftir the deith
of sanct Frances nocht sa religious as he was. Nochttheles they ar now men of
best life specially amang ws in Scotland.

How king Alexander punist sindry conspiratouris. And agreit king Hary of
Ingland and his nobillis. Of his new marriage. And of the natiuite of his son
Alexander. How money nobilli^ of Scotland were slane in Iovvry. Capi. xv.
LAng peace perseuerit eftir this in scotland. Quhyll at last Alane lord of
Galloway and constable of Scotland deceissit. And because he deuidit al his
landis before his deith amang hes three douchteris, His bastard son gaderit ane
army of.x.M. men, beleuyng to recouir the lordschip of Galloway. At last quhen
he had inuadit the cuntre with great trubill, he was slane with v.M. men of his
opinioun be ye earl of merche and Walter Stewart. And ye residew of hes oist
discomfist. The eldest douchter of this Alane of Galloway was maryit on Roger
Quincy, quhilk was maid Constable of Scotland, and brukit it continewally be
his succession, quhill the time of king Robert the secound. In quhais time this
Roger of Quincinis successioun was disherist and forfaltit for certane crimes
co^mittit aganis the kingis majesty. And eftir his forfalt, the constabillary
was geuyn to the Hayis of Arroll. Sic thingis done in Scotland king Alexander
was aduertist of great deuisioun rising betuix king Hary of Ingland and his
nobillis. And thairfore to to meis the samyn he went to London with Jane his
queen and Isobell his sister. And quhen he had agreit king Hary and his
nobillis of all debaitis, He maryit Isobell his sister on the earl of
Northfolk. And in the mean time Jane his queen deceissit but any successioun.
Quhilk thing causit king Alexander to return with great lament in Scotland. In
the nixt eir quhilk was fra our redemptioun ane thousand two h^ndreth xxxix.
eris, King Alexander ^ because he had na successioun of his body* maryit at

Nochtheles the end of al their ples^ir succedit to ang^^s and sorrow. For Patrik
Cuming (...) of Athole was slane within the nycht be Iohne Bissart. And ye

crime the Bissa^^is were banist out of Scotland and votit to the haly land,
their to fecht aganis the turkis and neuir to return in scotland. About this
time Somerleid thane of Argyle son to Somerleid before rehersit rasit great
truble in all part^s quhare he come, quhil at last he was brocht be the earl of
Merche with ane cord about his hals before ye king and gat remissioun be that

Ingland, trai^tyng great co^moditeis to fall to thaym be weris. And youcht the
samyn were contrarius to their co^moun weill, it they traistit the oppression
done to ye pepyll to be vnpunist during the weri^. For lawis and Justice hes na
place in time of battal. Their men in hop of their particular co^moditeis
inflambit king Hary co^trac his faith to inuaid scottis with battall, and began
to bygane castle fornens Berwik (howbeit it was cassyn down before be king
William be condition of peace) neuir to be edifyit in times cumyng. Ye bigging
of this castle had been sufficient occasion of weir betuix Inglis and scottis,
war not ye noblis of Ingland inhibit the samyn as contrar to yair band and
promise. And thus al occasion of battall ceissit. In the nixt eir followyng come
ambassatouris fra Lewis king of France, schawyng him reddy to pas in Iowry. and
yairfore desyrit support of Scotland in hes iornay. King Alexander be tenor of
his confideration with France, send Patrik earl of March, David Lindesay of
Glenesk, and Walter Stewart of Dundonald with ane nowmer of chosyn men to
support king Lewis in ye said iornay. All their scotts war slane be pest and
swerd i^ Egypt, and nane of yame returnit. Fra ye time forth, king Alexander
le^ffit not la^g, and deccissit in ane I Will of Argyle after great infirmite
ye.xxxv. eir of his regne, the.viii. day of July fra our redemp^ion
ane.M.ii.C.xlix. his body was buryit in Melros. In ye time of king Alexander
war money nobyll clerkis as Hugo cardinal of ye ordour of freir predicatouris,
quhilkis maid the co^mentaris of ye bybyll siclik was in their dayis sa^ct
Gilbert bischop of Caithnes. It is said the haly bischop sanct Dutho was in
their days preceptour to sa^ct Gilbert. Otheris sayis he was lang eris before
this time. Nochtheles in quhat sumeuir time he was, treuth is, He was ane man
of syngular and haly life, rich^ acceptabyll to god and man. His body lyis in
Ros haldin in great veneration of pepyll.

How the relics of sanct Margaret war translatit. How king Alexander was
haldin in captivity with the Cumyngi^. Of his marriage with king Hary the
third. And of the bigging of sa^ct Mungois kirk. Ca. xvi.
ALexander the secound buryit on this wise, his son Alexander ye third haua^d
bot.ix. eris in age was maid king. In the time of his coronatioun stude before
him ane hieland man, and salust him king of scottis in eloque^t meter of his
langage, schawing al ye kingis of quhilkis he was linialy discendit to Gathelus
the first begynnar of scottis, and was plesandly rewardit for his labouris.
King Alexander i^ ye secou^d eir of his regne conuenit all the prelatis and
baronis of his realm, and tuke up the bonis of his grandame sanct Margaret,
and put yame in ane precious fe^tour of silver the.xxi. day of July. And quhen
her blissit reliquies war brocht forthwart with may veneration, they baid
still at the sepulture of Malcolme her husband. and wald na way be seuerit fra
ye samyn. The pepyll war astonist be this uncouth miracle, not knawing ye cause
yairof. quhil at last ane agit man mouit be ye haly spreit exhortit yame to
heir him, and said sanct Margaret hes her husband in na les reverence now quhe^
he is deid, tha^ quhe^ he was on live. And yairfore scho will not pas to ye
place, quhare e devise her blissi^ bonis to rest, quhil ye bonis of her husband
be translatit with her on ye samyn manner. And quhen the samyn was done, scho
was brocht esaly to ye samyn place quhare scho lyis to yis day in great
veneratioun of pepyll, and both buryit in ane place. King Alexander had
bot.ix. eris of age quhen he was crownit. Ye noblis dredand yt be co^temption
of hes auctorite, great trubyl should rise, send ambassatouris in Ingland to renew
peace, and to desire king Haryis douchter to him in marriage. In the same eir
both this kingis co^uenit with money nobyl me^ speritual and temporal of both
ye realms at ork, Quhare king Alexander maryit Margaret doucht to king Hary
the third in may solempnite and reverence y^ micht be deuysit, on sa^ct
Steuins day in oule, and within few days after king Alexander returnit in
scotland. During ye tender age of king Alexander, ye realm of scotland was
gouernit in great felicite be his noblis. And after h^s cumyng to perfect age,
he maid him to puni^ sindry extorsionis done be certane of his noblis, and
su^mond ye erlis of Menteith, Athole, and Buchquhane, and the lord of Strabogy
quhilkis war all Cuminges, and put yame to his horn, because yai co^perit not
to hes Justice. Yir lordis mouit with yis displeseir set yame to revenge ye
samin, and finaly tuk ye king at Kinrossy with ane great power of men, and
brocht him to Striueling* quhare yai held him lang time in captivity and ward.
Throw quhilk ylk day tais mair trubyl in ye realm than was seen before, because
ye king was haldyn in captivity, quhilk should have done thaym Justice. The house
of Cumyngis war in their dayis full of riches, lands, and manrent. For by their
three cellis and lord foresaid their was.xxx. knychtis and landie even all of
ane surname. Bot as often occurris in this realm, men of great dominioun and
rentis ar sa suspitius to the king, that ye same is occasion of their rewyne.
Within few dayis after that king Alexander was taken in this manner, Walter earl
of Menteith the chief of all the Cumyngis was poisonit be his wife. Throw
quhilk ye remanent Cumyngis war sa astonist, that they put the king to liberte
and tuk remission for all crimes that micht be imput to thaym. This woman that
slew her husband the earl of Menteith with her new ^uffer Iohne Russell fled in
Ingland quhare scho deit in miserye. About this time paip Urbane the (...) of
that name Institute ye feist of ^orpus Cristi to be ylk thurisday after Trinite
sunday. The Carmili^e ^reris come at this time in Scotland and ereckit ane
chapel of our lady ou^ with the wallis of Perth to be their kirk. It is said
yt ane monk of Melros was admonist in the samyn time be ane vision in his
sleip, and fa^d ane part of the haly croce nocht far fra Peblis in Louthiane
within ane case. And nocht far fra ye samyn they fand ane pig craftily in
grauyn. In quhilk was found certane bonis wound in silk, bot it was not knawin
quhais bonis yai war. Als sone as ye case was opnit quhare ye haly croce was
inclusit, money myraclis apperit. King Alexander mouit be deuotioun thairof,
biggit ane abbay in the honor of ye haly croce, In the quhilk ar now monkis
after the ordour of the Trinite. Not lang after was ane conuentioun betuix ye
two kyngis of Ingland and scotland at Wark accumpanyit with yair noblis of
both their realms. Their was sa good redres maid on ylk side, that both the
realms war in g^ttar tranquillite than ^uir was seen in any kyngis time before.
At this time the kirk of Glasgew was completit to the same perfectioun as it
standis this day biggit with great magnificence. the may part be liberalite of
William bischop thairof, quhilk leuit nocht lang after the completyng of the
samyn.

Of great derth in Albion. How Acho king of Norrovvay Inuadit Scotland with
great cruelteis. Of the orison maid to him be ambassatouris of king Alexander,
Ca. xvii.
IN the eir of god ane.M.ii.C.lxiii. was ane great derth in Albion. For the
heruist was sa wak in ye eir before, that the cornis for ye mais^ part war
corruppit. and maid ane miserabyll derth throw all boundis of Albion. Acho king
of Norroway and Denmark heirand how Scotland was trublit in this manner, beleuit
to find sufficient occasion to subdew it to his dominioun. and arriuit with ane
flot of schyppis in the Ilis on Lammas day callit aduincula Petri. The Ilis war
continewally hal^in under the empire of Danis fra king Edgaris time to their
days. Eft this king Acho come in Arrane and Bute. And quhen king Acho had
subdewit yame to his empire in esperance of mair felicite* he arriuit in Albion
and tuk ye castle of Air be lang sege, and began to waist al ye boundis liand
yair about. King Alexander astonist be yir nouellis (for he was of oung and
tender age and not sufficient to resyst the cruelte of Danis after sa frequent
victoryis falling to thaym) thocht na thing sa good as to brek hes ennimes be
lang tarry. and to that fine he mycht prolong the battall, he send ambassatouris
to king Acho, of quhilkis the principal said to him in this manner. War nocht
our king and nobillis be anciant consuetude obseruit sen their first beginning,
^eikis redres of all iniuris done to thaym, before they inuaid their ennymes
with battall. Thou should nocht se oratouris send to the, bot erar ane army
cumand in thy contrar with may awful and weirly ordinance. We get neuir sa
huge spule nor it sa triumphant victoryis of our ennimes, as quhen they inuaid
ws with may wrangis, and will heir na reason nor redres. We thynk na thing sa
good, as to eschew battall and tak restitutioun of our guddis, quhilkis ar taken
fra ws be iniure of battall. Quhow may their be any gretar wodnes or fury, tha^
to do the thing be swerd or fire, that may be tretit be plesand wordis.
Nochtheles quhen our honorabyll and just desiris ar refusit be ennymes, quhen
we find thaym mair desirus of weir than peace. We rise haistely with may
hatrent to revenge their contemptioun. Heirfore we are send fra our souerane to
inquire quhat occasioun thou hes to inuaid his realm and subdittis in
violatioun of peace, quhilk hes been obseruat betuix him and Danis their hundred
eris bygane, and cumand nocht only to reif fra him Bute and Arrane with other
la^dis quhilkis he hes iosit in peace. Bot als ceissing fra na manner of cruelte
yat may be deuysit on his pepyl. Quhat offense, quhat cruelteis hes his pepyl
done aganis the to inuaid his realm with sic awful ordinance. Slaing wiffis,
childrin, and febyll personis without any mercy or ra^soun, howbeit may
cruel tyrannis hes miseratioun of sic personis. Quhat furius Ire hes mouit the
to birne ye kirkis of god and his sanctis to ye great murder of his pepyll. Quhy
puttis thou al placis (quhare thou cumis) to heirschippis and rewin. Attour gyf
thou dredis not god quhilk gouernis al thing yt we se be his providence. Gif
thou dredis not sanctis, nor vengeance to cu^ on the be punytion of god. it
thou should dreid the two may pissant kingis of Albion alliat togidder with
may tender blud, quhilkis sal cu^ on the with sic pissance, yt thou may not

skaithis in time, in adventure thou be brocht to sic extreme disperation, thy
army disco^fist, yt thou sall be vterly distroyit, and find nocht but repuls
yocht thou wald implore mercy. Their wourdis war said be the ambassatouris to
put su^ terror to this hardy king Acho. nochtheles he answerit to yame i^ these
manner. e belief (wise ambassatouris) to astonis ws be our fers and awful
wourdis, traisting ws sa full of dredour, yt we will desist fra our purpos be
our only minassyng. e ar void of al reason and prudence, gyf e sa ymagyn, and
quhare e aggrege our iniuris be reiffyng of certane Ilis fra our dominioun, we
understand e ar na lauchfull Iugeis to geif decision of any iniures or richtis
pertening to ws or our liegis. Forthir gif e desire ye cause quhy we haif
inuadit Arrane and Bute. We say not only their Ilis of Arrane and Bute bot all the Ilis of Albion pertenis to ws and our pepyl be auld heritage. And we are
cumyn to tak as mekyll proffet of our landis presently, as e have taken of thaym
in times bygane. Thairfore schaw to our king we feir nocht his minassyng nor
na other violence that he may do aganis ws, Nochtwithstandyng gyf he be mair
desirus of peace tha^ battall, and couatis to eschew the diceptioun and birnyng
of his towns, ye slauchter of his pepyl, or gif he desyrit not to se ye vter
exterminion of his realm before his ene, command him to send to ws.x.M. markis
striueling for the frutis of our landis taken up be him and his eldaris in times
bygane. Dischargeand him thairof in times cumyng, that the said Ilis may pas
under our perpetual dominioun. Gif he refuse the charge, force is to him to
abide the chance of battall aganis ws, quhilkis ar prepari^ with may weirly
ordinance to invade his realm and pepyll.

How king Alexander come with (...) army aganis king Acho. Of the (...) maid
be the two kyngis to their armyis* and how king Acho was d^sco^^^st at
largis. Ca. xviii.
ALexander co^mouit with this answer and seeing na way to eschew battall,
thocht thing na sa good as to assail ye chance of fortoun, and gaderit.xl.M. m^
to meit his enaimes quhilkes were deuidit i^ three batalles. In ye first ^ing was
ane vailea^t kny^ht Alexander Stewart nepot to ye Alexander. Yat dotat ye abbay
of paslay. He had with him all the m^n of Argyle, Leuenax, Athole, and
Galloway. In the left wyng was Patrik Dunbar hauand with him the men of
Louthiane, Fiffe, Men's, Berwik and Striueling. In ye myddil wa^d was king
Alexander with the remanent pepill of scotland to support ye wyngis quhen
dangeir occu^rit. Yir ba^tallis were arrayit in sic manner, That every clan had
ane capitane assignit to thayn of their awin langage to exhort thaym to win
land and honor be yair manheid. King Alexander seeing his ennymes in sycht,
causit mes be done to his army. And said to yame in yis manner. We haif maid now
(beluffit freindis) our orisoun to god (be quhais providence and wisdom every
thing is gouernit in erd) to send victory to thaym quhilkes hes may rycht and
Iustest cause of battall. Now wald I exhort ow to have sic faith and confidence
in him that is ennymy to theuis and re^aris, that e may with invincible curage
distroy our ennimes. Belief weil e ar nocht to fecht now aganes yaim ye inuadis
our landis be Just clame bot only aganis thaym that ^raistis be penurite of
vittallis now regna^d amang ow to find sufficient oportunite to conques our
landis. Their lymmaris reiosis sa mekill in thift and reif, that they ar nocht
content only of the landis reft fra ws their money eris bigane, bot ar cumin
with new tyranny to dwell in our may inward la^dis. Remembir heirfore nocht
only the heavy and importable iniuris be yame done. Bot als how necessar it is
now to fecht aganis thaym for defense of our wyffis, barnis, liberteis and
landis, hauand na securite of life, bot in our handis. Restis schortlie na
other thing, bot other to vincus our ennimes with manheid Or ellis to leif
miserabillie vnd yair servitude. And suffir our wiffis and douchteris to be
ful^it be yair lust. Remembir that e ar nocht to fecht now only for our native
cunire, bot for the liuis of thaym that are may deir and tendir freindis.
Considir ye nocht only I, bot al scotland seis ow fecht yis day. and notis
both our ma^heid and cowarty. Belt ow yairfo^ (vaileant campionis) with ye
more manheid and curage yt our matter is just and mouit only in our pure
defense. Co^sidir how our ennymes inuadis ow only for pray and spule of gudis,
and salbe thairfore sone vincust, quhen they se ow geuin with perseuerant
constance to debait the samyn. And first I pray ow refresche our bodyis with
meit. Syne cloith ye samyn with armor, that e may be ye grace of god have
victory. Skarslie were their wourdis said, quhen king Acho began to exhort his
army in manner as followis. Were nocht our manheid is prouin to me lang time
(wise freindis) with sicker victory in our ha^dis. It had been vane to ieoperde
my body this day with ow, or to haif assaileit sic thingis yat been vncertane
for thaym yat ar certane. It had been more lesum (gyf e be febill and astonist
pepill) to have leuit ane hard and sobir life at hame with misery and great
laubour, than to have ieoperd ow in battall aganis our strange ennymes.
Nochtheles sen e with deliuerit purpos ar votit to follow good fortoun and me, e
may se how occasion and sufficient oportunite schawis quhat virtew and r^ward
sall follow to Ilk man for his laubouris. e se now (that e desirit may) our
ennymes full of riches and guddis, quhilkis ar to be gottin now be na thing sa
mekill, as preis and dint of swerd. And nocht only gif e happin to have the
glore of victory, sall fall to ow the rich treasour of this army. Bot the
hai^l realm of scotland sal fall in reward of our laubouris. Uincus thairfore
our ennymes, and every thing in scotland salbe offerit to ow with may
magnificence, and fra our ennimes be vincust, every ane of ow salbe rewardit
with landis at our pleseir. And e salbe als rich i^ times cu^yng, as our
ennymes ar at yis time. For their (sen great chargis may nocht be done but
extreme ieoperdie) I beseik ow advise how esalye yis battal sal be led agan^s
our ennymes. For the the derth (that now ap^eris amang thaym) hes maid thaym
more febill than any other pepill. Thus ar they so destitute of corporal
strenth, that they sall gyf bakkis to ws or they cum to any straikis. For they
ar bot ane schaddow of pepill, and may yairfore be slane like miserabill
beistis, and because they ar in more noumer of pepil than e, their spule salbe
to ow the more rich. Be contrar gyf disco^fiture fallis to ow (quhilk god
forbeit) na thing sal fallow bot deith and heirschip quhare e cum. And youcht I
belief na thing les than sic aduersiteis. I beseik ow gif any sic misaduenture
fallis, revenge our deith, that e be nocht slane like beistis, quhilkis ar
offerit in sacrifice. For we are circulit (as e se) on ilk side wi^h ennymes,
and our schippis seuerit sa far fra ws, that we may ha^f na refuge thairby.
Thus restis na succouris to ws gif we be discomfist. Attour quhat folly and
quhat extreme misery is to any creature, to leif the wappinnis (quhilkis may
defend hes life) and have his confidence only in swiftnes of feit. Now sen e
have sa good experience, quhat commoditeis may fall be our manheid, and quhat
mischief and sorrow may fall be our cowartry, suffir nocht our handis to dull in
sleuth, yt e may be propic^a^t fortoun have sikir victory, quhilk is now in our
handis, quhairthrow incredible riches and felicite may their eftir succeid.
Skarsly were their wourdis endit, quhen both the armyis began to array other. In
ye mean time Acho come with all his ordinance on the middilward, quhare king
Alexander was arrayit for the time, traisting (gif ye samyn were brokin) ye
remanent battallis to be sone vincust. This battall was fochtyn with great
cruelte on athir side, specialie quhair the two kyngis faucht. For they ruschit
ay to yai partis, quhair yai saw their pepil waikest, exhortyng yame to schaw
their manheid and curage King Acho incontinent maid him with ane band of forcy
campionis to rusche out throw ye samyn battal quhair king Alexander faucht.
Nochttheles he was stoutly resistit. For king Alexander had sa great noumer of
pepill with him, that he stuffit the battall with fresche men in all partis
quhair it faileit, quhill at last both the wyngis of Danis were put to ^lycht.
Incontinent Alexander Stewart of Paslay come with an^ bus^hement of fresche men
to the myd^ilward, quhair king Alexander was fechta^d aganis king Acho with
la^g bergane and vncertane victory. Ye Danis seand this Alexander cum with new
and rece^t victory on yame, (...) bakkis. On quhome followit ye ^^ottis with
great cruelte throw all ^unynghame, and maid Ithand slau^h^e^ on thaym, ^uhill

On ye tothir side Robert bruce (howbeit he was disce^dit of ye ou^gest doucht

clamit ye croun for ye reason to pertene to him. Yis debait and clame was sa

ye tothir should usurp the crown perforce. They remittit the decision of ye
richt yairof to king Edward of Ingland with power to constrane ye said pertiis to

upon ye decision of yis debait. For eft his returning to London, he brocht
certane resolute men out of france to decide on yis matter, and co^mandit yame
to be vareant and dowble in yair delyuerance to ye fine, yat quhen yai war
found vareant and not of ane mind i^ decision of yis pley, he micht ye erar make

to have may richt* as cumyn of ye eldest sist. King edward believing
sufficient time to co^ques ye realm of scottis (because it was deuidit in syndry

(as he deuisit before) to geif final sentence in this matter. And quhen he was
cumyn with both ye pertiis and his ass^^^soures in ane quiet chalmer quhare it
was deuisit to sit on this matter. He causit ye samyn to be kepit with may
deligence but any ysching or entres, and concludit to make him king, that wald
be sworn to hald ye croun of him as superioure thairof. And because he knew
Robert Bruc^ of singular manheid and wisdom above ye Balliol, he thocht best
to assail him first, and gif he war repugnant to his desiris to geif ye crown
to ye Balliol. At last quhen king Edward had proponit yis matter in manner before

How the balliol come in great trubyl for the making of homage to king Edward,
of his allia with king Phillip of France. How king Edward won Bervvik be

King Balliol on sa^ct (...) day of ule in the nixt eir, come to the new
castle and maid homage to king Edward for ye realm of scotland contrary mind
of all his noblis, geuand him self and his realm (quhilk was fre to his days)

king John^ become penitent of ye making of ye said homage, and se^d his
ambassatouris to London to renounce ye said homage, and allegit because it was
maid but auise of ye.iii. estates of scotland, it was vane i^ ye self and not

will not cu^ to ws, we sal cu^ to him. and to dant ye scotts mair esaly he send

bruce i^ sic familiarite, yt he promittit to make him king of scottis. and in
espera^ce yairof. he gaif hi^ ye keeping of syndry great castellis of scotland,
quhilkes war for ye time i^ Inglismenis hands. king balliol dreda^d be yir

and Horny, for quhilkes king Iohne sall ressaue.lx.M. crounis of towquhair.
Than was the Balliol aduertist, that king Edward was cumand with great ordinance
to sege Berwik. And thairfore he conuenit his nobillis to ane counsal, and be
yair auise, send money of all the baronis and gentilmen of Fife and Louthiane to
the defense thairof. The Inglismen come nocht only with strange army be land,
bot als come with ane great navy to sege the said town be see. Ye scottis
(quhilkis were send be ye Ballioll for defense of ye town) tuk.xviii* of their
schippis, and the remanent chasit fra ye sege. King Edward more prouokit than
brokin be this displeseir, come with doubill army more yan before to tak ye said
town. And because he couth nocht get it be force (for the great defense yat ye
scottis maid with in it) he thocht to assail the samyn with may treasonable
slycht, and maid him to raise his army fra the sege of the said town. Syne went
about to ane other part, and returnit with feneit ensen^eis and baneris of
scotland, haua^d sanct Androis croce above their harnes on ye scottis manner,
and send certane lymmaris of scotland before to ye town. Saying John^ Balliol

King Balliol heira^d ye miserabil slauchter of his pepyll at Berwik, gaderit

Nochtheles yai war al slane be yis cruel tyrane king Edward but any respect to

victory king Edward tuk both the castle of Edinburgh and Striuelyng, and
chasit ye Balliol to ye castle of For^ar^. And their Iohne Cumyng lord of
Strabogy come to king Edward, and was sworn his lege man. And sone after yis
Iohne Coming brocht the Balliol with his son Edward to Mo^^ros quhair ye said
John^ Balliol void of al kingly abuleme^tis, come with ane quhit wand in his

quhare yai war sworn to be leill and true subdittis to him in times cumyng. And
for the mair secur^^e, he constranit yame to randir all ye strenthis and

scotland, leuand his son in plege yt he should attempt na rebellion aganis him.
Iohne Balliol eft his returnyng seeing him self nothir cherist with co^monis nor

How king Edvvart come with ane army aganis France. How the earl of

King Edward nocht remouyng the battal out of his mind* that he supersedit on
France, garnist all the strenthis of scotland to resist the rebellyon of

to be Regent of Scotland to his returning. And beleuit little iniuris to be
attemptit be scottis, for the great afflictioun done to yame be his weris before

munition nor sicker targe, nochtwithstandyng quhat sumeuir garneson be laid in
defense thairof. For every pepyl yt is oppressed with tyranny will labor to
exoner thaym yairof, quhen euir yai may find any sufficient oportunite. Ye
lords of scotland sone after ye departing of king Edward, renuncit al band and

wallace son to schir Andro Wallace of Cragy knicht, he was of stature and
corporal strenth above al other man seen in his dayis, with sic prudence and
craft of cheuelry, ye nane was found perregal to him. This Wallace fra his
first outh persewit Inglismen with extreme* hatrent, and be sindry ieoperdis
did money vaileant actis in support of scottis. and was of sic incredible
strenth at his cu^yng to his perfect age, yt he vincust oftymes.iii. or.iiii.
Inglisme^ atanis in singular battall. Quhen ye fame of his illuster vassalage
was blawin throw the realm money nobyll men (to exoner yame fra servitude of

of al pertis of scotland, and left nothir temporal, spiritual, nor religius man

yt ye principal capitanis yairof war forth, and slew all personis found in it.
Syne garnist it in his stra^gest manner. After this he went to Aberdene. quhilk
was left wast to his cu^yng. And because the castle was garnist with sic
provision, yt it mycht not be takyn but great murdir of pepyll, he left the
samyn and returnit in Angus. King Edward heirand their doingis in France, send
Hew Cressinghame with ane army to invade Wallace. Als sone as Wallace was
aduertist of the coming of this army, he left the sege of Cowpar and went to
the brig of Stryuelyng to stop ye ouircumyng of Hew Cressinghame, and fynaly
slew him be syngulare manheid, and put his army to flicht. After this victory,
he returnit to ye sege of Cowper, quhilk was ra^derit to him sone after his

with ane certane of his may tender freindis. And because he saw ane miserabil
derth rising in all partis of scotland to ye great mortalite of ye pepyl thairof,
he gaif his besines to releif ye pepyl, and to sustene yame on ye frutis of
Ingland. Incontinent he co^mandit al scotts to be reddy agane ane prefixed day
to pas on their auld ennymes. And in the mean time he maid sic punition on yame
(quhilkis (...) repugnant to his proclamation) (...) ye remanent pepyl for feir
yairof (...) to hes purpos. Sone eft Wallace with.iii. battallis arrayit in may
awful ordinance brint and herijt al Northumbirland to the New castle, and be
^^me of his forcy cheuelry become in sic ^errou^ to his fayis, yt he returnit
with rich spule and great triu^phis in scotland but any battall.

Of king Edvvardis message send to VVallace. of V^allace answer* and of his
great prudence in cheuelry. How the scottis war discomfist at the Falkirk. and
how the king of France purchest peace to scottis. Ca. v.
EDward la^g scha^kis heirand ye great heirschippis and slauchter done to his
pepil, returnit with heavy displeseir in Ingland, and send his ambassatouris to
Wallace saying, had he been in Ingland, Wallace durst not have done sic
cruelteis to his pepyl. To their wordis answerit Wallace, he tuk not bot has
time on Ingland quhen king Edward was out of it, as king Edward tuke on
scotland, quhen he fand ye samyn destitute of ane heid, makand him to conques
the realm after that the noblis had chosin him, as amiable and freindly
co^positour to geif decisioun upon the Iuris and richtis of two partis
contending for ye crown. Attour to make his syngulare ma^heid and prudence mair
knawin to Inglismen, and that king Edward may understand his besines geuyn in
perpetual defense of scotland, with obstinat mind both to deliver the said
realm out of servitude and to revenge the cruelteis done be Inglismen in times
bygane, He co^ma^dit ane herald to pas to king Edward to aduertis him, yt he
should hald his Pasche in Ingland (gif god fortunit him to be on live) in dispite
of king Edward and al pepil yat will beir armoure in his name. At last quhen
king Edward and Wallace war both cumyn to the place assignit, the day of
battall was set on all sydis. Howbeit Inglismen wa^ in dowble mair nowmer tha^
scottis. it Wallace with per^e curage na thing effrayit of yair multitude com
first to field. And quhen the armyis war reddy to ione, ye Inglismen left their
palonis and maid yame to f^e. In the mean time ye scottis proud after money
victoryis, and seand yair ennymes geif bakkis, micht scarsly be refrenit fra
the chase. Wallace (quhilk knew na thing better than ye dissait of Inglismen)
ran with swift horse before the scottis, exhortyng yame to ryn not wylfully to
their awin perdition, deuisit aganis yame be slicht of ennymes. because the
hasty fleyng of Ing^^smen was nocht bet cullourit fra^^e, and yairfore it was
sufficient to yame to have victory bot any strakis. Ye scottis beand dantit
thus of their wyld fury be prudence of this worthy camploun, were saiffit with
their honor and liuis, and returnit in scotland with infinite spule and
riches. Forthir (as the pepill supportit Wallace ay the more yat he grew in
manheid and pissance aganis Inglismen) on the samyn manner yai began to inuy
him, quhen he was cumin be his vaileant dedis to may felicite and honor,
specially the great lordis and princis of the realm, hauand great indignattoun
that ane man of small lynage should rise be his virtew in sa great estimation and
reverence above yame. Throw quhilk raise great seditioun in Scotland, specially
be the Cumyngis and Robert Bruce, quhilkes inuyit him may. King Edward
knawing this new sedition, send his ambassatouris to the principal men
(quhilkis inui^t Wallace may) and quhen he had gottyn yame bound to his
opinion, he come with ane army in Scotland. Wallace knawing na thing of this
treason deuisit aganis him, rasit his army and met him at the Falkirk. Eftir
his cumyng raise ane odious debait betuix ye Stewart Cumyn and Wallace, quhilk
of thaim three should have the wangard. Ye first two thocht heavy, yat a man of
sobir lynage and small beginning, should be preferrit to thaym in dignite and
honouris of cheualry. Ye third thocht the charge was geuin to him be the three
esta^tis of scotland. And for yat cause he wald gif na place to yame. In ye
mean time ye Inglisme^ come so awfully aganis thaym, that yai were constranit to
cum forthwart aganis their ennymes, with breistis boldyn more to yair awin ya^
to yair (...) disples^ir. King Edward (...) their seditioun, come with (...)
more deligence in battall. And quhen the battallis were reddy to June, ye
Cumyngis fled out of the field with all fol^es of yair opinion. Robert Bruce
was this time with the army of Ingland and myt yairfor make na support to
scottis. And so yai were miserably slane on all sydis. And youcht ye scottis
were murdrist on this manner, ic Wallace left na thing undone, that mycht pertene
to the deuore of ane vaileant campioun. Exhorting his folkis sumtyme to be
nocht effrayir with yame quhilkis war before disco^fist with only feir of yair
visage. su^tyme ruscheand throw his ennymes to yair great slaucht, and instruck
and his folkis quhat was to be done, bot at last all the scottis that faucht
that day with him ouirset with multitud of Inglismen and ye cumpanyis of Robert
Bruce cumand on their bakkis were slane. Wallace seand him circulit on all
partis ruschit feirslye throw his ennymes, and deliuerit him him self in that
manner. In the mean time ane strange capitane of England namyt freir Brtangis
followit on Wallace with great ferocite, bot Wallace na thing astonist of his
cuming met him (nochtwithstanding ye discomfitour of scotts) with sic manheid
and curage, yat he slew yis capitane before the face of all the army of Ingland.
Than the residew of Inglismen for feir yairof, ceissit fra any for their chase
on scottis. In yis unhappy battal was slane John Stewart of Bute with all his
folkis, quhilkis were left be Wallace in extreme dangeir after that he micht
have delyuerit yame yairof. Makduf was slane in this battal with schir Iohne
Grahame, quhais deith was ^icht displesant to Wallace* Money other nobyl and
vaileant men war slane in the same manner, quhilkis war ouir prolixt to schaw.
It is said that Robert Bruce (after that he had cumyn on ye backis of scottis
said to Wallace in this manner. O Wallace quhat presumptuous folly is in the,
knawyng thy self desert and left be the nobillis and commonis of Scotland, to
fecht with sic vane audacite aganis the pissance of the rich king of Ingland.
Seis thou nocht thy self ^ynnand to vter confusioun. Consideris thou not the
irrecouerabyl damage approcheing to thy displeseir. To this answerit Wallace.
O Robert thy febyll cowartry and sleuth mouis me to assail so money patellus
ieoperdyis in defense of thy rycht and delyuering of the realm of Scotland fra
tyranny of Inglisme^. Their wourdis war sa deip inp^entit (...) the brucis heart,
that he determit (...) abide na langat at the opinion of Ingland. Treuth is
that sendill or (...) ar ye scottis vincust be Inglismen without sum diuisioun
amang thaym self. For youcht the Scottis (...) this time stude in sic array,
that they war inuincibyl, and culd nocht (...) before. it Robert Bruce come with
ane buschement of Inglismen on their bakkis. Be quhilk they war miserably
discomfist and slane. This battall was strykyn on the Magdalen day fra our
redemp^^oun ane.M.ii.C.lxxxxviii. ^ris. Thairfore the Inglismen held it ay
after, for ane happy day to fecht aganis scottis. Forthir youcht Robert Bruce
(quhilk was after king of scottis) was both at the battall of Dunbar, and the
battall of Falkirk at ye opinion of Ingland aganis the scottis, na crime mycht
be imput to him thairfore. First because he had na refuge in Scotland. For the
Ballioll persewit him to the deid, because he was contendand with him for the
crown. Secoundly he held the lordschip of cleueland of the king of Ingland, and
was ane Inglisma^ born, howbeit he was nerest air be proximite of blud to the
crown of Scotland, and be reasoun thairof behuuit to make him service. Als
king Edward promittit to retreit the sentence he gaif for the Ballioll and to
make the said Robert king. Attoure sanct Paul (as we find) was ane great scurge
of crystyn pepyll and persewit thaym with may cruel ennymyte. And fra he
come to their opinioun he was the gretest pyllar of our faith. On the samyn
manner he wheit Robert Bruce persewit the Scottis with great cruelte for
postponyng of him fra his just heritage and croun. it fra he was maid king, he
was the best prince that euir rang above the scottis. For youcht he fand
scotland in great misery and neir conquest be tyranny of Inglismen, it he
recouerit it be his syngulare manheid and left it fre but any clame in good
tranquillyte. Wallace after yis discomfitoure come to Perth. And because he
couth nocht suffir the Inuy of the nobyllis rysyng ylk day aganis him, he
exonerat him of all auctorite, and dischargit him of the governance of the
realm. The samyn time Philip the fourt of that name king of France, hauand
great miseratioun on the calamyte fallyn to his confiderat freindis of Scotland
for the actioun allanerlye of France, send his ambassatouris to Edward prince
of Ingland, quhilk was contrackit in marriage before with his douchter, and
purchest peace to scottis. Fra ye feist of all sanctis to the Witsonday nixt
following.

How Inglismen were discomfist at Roslyng. How king Edvvard^ conquest great
roumes in Scotland* and how the Fo^bessis tuke their first beginning. Ca. vi.
THe Scottis brokin with co^tinewal weris, send their ambassatouris to paip
Boniface. to co^plene the great affliction done to thaym be king Edward. quhilk
was set in perdition of their liberte to co^ques yair realm, and desirit ye
paip (sen he had mair empire above Inglismen than any other realm) to
interpone his auctorite. And constrane king Edward to desyst fra inuasioun of
scottis. For the scottis war content that al pleyis concerning the liberte and
croun of scotland, war decidit be his halynes. Sen the samyn may na othirwayis
be decidit, for insufferabil damage falling to ye pepyl be blind desire of
nobyllis contending for ye crown. The paip after that he had taken ripe
deliberation in this matter, decernit ye scottis to have just action of battal
in defense of their liberteis aganis king Edward. Sone after the Scottis chesit
Iohne Cumyn to be gouernoure of their realm. Als sone as king Edward was
aduertist of yair rebellyon, he send ane army throw all boundis of scotland,
and come to Perth inuadyng the cuntre with great trubyll. Money of the nobyllis
(because they micht nocht suffer his iniuris) war randerit. Otheris quhilkis had
mair sycht to their liberte than servitude, fled to ye woddis. And chesit Simon
Fraseir to be college in their weris to Iohne Cumyn. Syne gaderit ane power
of.viii. thousand chosyn men to revenge the iniuris done be Inglismen. And
fynaly slew every ane of thaym that was ouir takyn, And the remanent chasit out
of the cuntre. King Edward commouit with this vassalage, send ane vaileant
capitane namit Rodulphe Confrey in scotland with.xxx. thousand men. This
Rodulphe after his cumyng in scotland, tuke lytyl respect of scottis bot
allanerly (as he war cumyn) to take all scotland at his pleseir. And thairfore
purposit to pas throw the boundis of scotland with three armyis at three sindry
partis, ylk army hauand x. thousand men in nowmer. And co^mandit thaym to meit
all togydder at Roslyng. after they had cumyn throw the cuntre at three syndry
partis. Als sone as Iohne Cumyn and Simon Fraseir war aduertist yairof, they
rasit their folkis, traisting na thing sa good as to assail the chance of
battal with ane of their three armyis, for they traistit gyf it happinnit thaym
to have victory of ane of their three armyis, ye remanent two the mair able to be
vincust. Incontinent they exhortit their folkis to fecht for defense of their
wyffis, lyberteis, and guddis. The scottis rasit be their wourdis in esperance
of victory, faucht with sic invincible curage, that they put the first battal
of Inglismen to flicht. Skarsly had they gaderit the spule thairof, quhen ye
secound battall come on yame with mair cruelte than the first. Nochtheles throw
curage of their recent victory they ionit with incredibyll manheid. And skarsly
was this secound battall vincust, quhen the third battal come on thaym with
fresche power. And yocht the scottis war woundit and slane in great nowmer. it
be hortatioun of their capitane they ruschit pertely with new spreit and curage
on their ennimes. and after lang bergane they put all yair ennimes to flycht.
Few of yame had been sauit, war nocht the scottis war ouirset be lang fechting.
This victory succedit to Scottis on sanc^ Mathewis day, fra our redemption
i.M.iii.C. and two eris. It is in dout, gif euir any victory was conquest
before their dayis with more manheid and honor.xxx. thousand Inglismen with
lang provision and set bat^all vincust and dyscomfist with skars.viii. thousand
Scottis. And thairfore Ilk man beleuit this victory nocht cuming but singular
favor and grace of god. And it ye scottis kepit bot schort time yis victory.
For king Edward knawin yis discomfitour at Rosling, rasit his army to inuaid ye
scottis both be see and land. Ye scottis seand his ordinance of more pissance
than they mycht resist, fled to their strenthis, throw quhilk king Edwardis
army went but any obstakill throw all scotland fra north to south partis
yairof. And na man found to resist yame except Wallace and sa money as assistit
to him, quhilkis leiffit in the montanis and woddis to eschew the fury of
Inglismen. King Edward heirand ye Wallace lurkit in dennis and lay in wait
abidyng sum time to inuaid Inglismen, desirit him be sindry message to be
sworn Inglisman, and to have thairfore great erldomes and lordschippis within
Ingland. Wallace refusit, saying hes liberte was more to him with small rentis
in scotland, than possession of great landis in Ingland under servitude. The
castle of Striueling was kepit in yir dayis b^ ane vaileant knycht schir
William Olifer. And quhen he had been continewally segit three monethis, for
la^^ of vitallis he ra^derit ye house to king Edward under their conditionis. All
personis that are in ye said castle, sal have fre pasport to depart with yair
baggis and guddis at their pleseir. Nochtheles king Edward (as ane falls tyrane)
brak his aith and promise in that behalf. For eftir that the castle was
randerit, he tuke schir William Olifer and send him as presoner to Londoun,
quhair he remanyt money eris eftir in captivity. Money other castellis were taken
be king Edward in the same manner, and all the sodiouris thairof slane but any
mercy or ranson. Ye castle of Urquhard was takin, and nane left on live in it,
except ane woman great with child of quhome the surname of Boyis and Forbes
discendit. This woman yat was sauit in this manner, was wife to Alexander boyis
lord of the said castle. Howbeit it was unknown for the time, for scho was in
pure array Eftir taiking of this castle scho fled in Ireland quhare scho bure
her son Alexander. This Alexander (quhen scotland was recouerit out of
Inglismennis ha^dis) come to king Robert Bruce, and desirit to be restorit to
hes faderis heritage, quhilk was occupyit for the time with other possessoris.
King Robert weary quhat was to be done in yis ma^er, for he thocht it nocht
semand that ane prince should tak the landis fra nobill men, quhilkis were geuin
to thaym in reward of yair manheid. And als it was not Just to spule ye man of
his kindly heritage. Quhilk had his fader, his freindis, and all his guddis
tynt in defense of the realm. Yus was ane mydway deuisit. Be quhilk certane
landis in Mar of litil les proffet yan the landis of Urquhard were geuyn to the
said Alexander boyis. Nochy^les this man that was callit Boyis, was callit
Forbes. For he slew ane beit be singular manheid. Of quhome the surname of
Forbessis is discendit.

Of sindry great cruelteis done be king Edward aganis scottis. How ye bruce
and Cumyn ^var confiderat, and how the Cumyn was slane. Ca. vii.
SCotland beand subdewit in this manner, king Edward gart distroy all the auld
lawis and constitutionis of Scotland, traisling thairthrow to cause the scottis
and Inglismen to incres togidder in blude, amite, and faith. He brint all the
Cronikles of Scotland with all manner of bukis als weill of deuyne service as of
other materis. To that fine that the memory of Scottis should peris. Great
punitioun was maid on thaym quhilkis war repugnant to their chargis. He gart the
Scottis write bukis after the use of Sarum, and constranit thaym to say after
that use. Attoure he banist all Scottis (quhilkis had any syngulare eruditioun)
and put thaym in Oxfurd, dreidand that the nobillis of Scotland be their
eruditioun should incres in virtew. And sum time deliver their realm of
servitude. Attoure this tyrane had sic bane arrogance that he dystroyit all the
antiquiteis of Scotland. And after that he had passit throw syndry boundis
thairof, he commandit the round tempyl beside Camelon to be cassin down, quhilk
was biggit (as we have schawin) in the honor of Claudius empriour and the
gods Uictory. Nocht suffering be his Inuy sa mekyll of the antiquiteis of
our eldaris to remane in memory. it the inhabitantis saiffit the samyn fra
vter euersioun. and put the Roman ansene and superstitionis out of ye wallis
thairof. And ingrauit the armis of king Arthoure, and commandit it to be callit
Arthouris hoif. (...) ^yng Edward before his returning in Ingland (that na
memory should remane of Scotland their bukis beand universally brint) send the
chiar of marbyll out of Scotland to London. And put it in Westmynster quhare it
remanis it. Syne callit all the lordis of Scotland to ane conuention ar sanct
Androis and tuk new band of thaym to be leill and true subdittis to him but any
rebellioun in times cumyng. All the lordis of Scotland war bound to him that
day except Wallace, quhom na landis nor riches mycht brek fra defense of the
lyberte of Scotland. King Edward (to hald the Scottis at his opinioun) left
behynd him ane vaileant knycht Odomer Wallance to be gouernoure of Scotland.
Syne returnit with great triumph to London. In the mean time Robert Bruce and
Iohne Cumyn conuenit togydder. And first the Cumyn said to the Bruce. Thou seis
how king Edward slais our pepyll but any occasyoun, and occupyis our kyngrik
but reasoun. Be of good curage thairfore, and take thy armor and wappynnis.
Suffer me to have thy landis, and I sall make ye king. Gyf thou will nocht do
that, suffer me to be king and thou sall nocht only have all my landis and
heritage. Bot thou sall ay be nixt me in honor and dignite. Thus was the
Bruce and Cumyn confiderat togidder with endentouris subscriuit with athir
handis and interchangit be their selis. Sic thingis done the Bruce returnit in
Ingland. This rebellyoun of Robert Bruce procedit, because he was haldyn ay with
king Edward in suspicion for the richt that he had to the crown of Scottis. And
thairfore he durst not remane lang in Scotland. for king Edward had slane him
before* gif he micht have gottin him and all his brethir togidder. After this
confideration ye Cumyn tho^ht his power and auctorite wald be of lityl effect
in scotland, gif the Bruce war king, and thairfore he send ane secret seruand
to king Edward, and schew ye writingis la^^ly maid betuir him and Robert Bruce,
desiring king Edward (gif he intendit to iose scotland but trubyll) to put ye
Bruce haistely to deith. King Edward gaif litil faith (...) yir writyngis at
the first sicht. for he beleuit yt they come only be Inuy of the Cumyn, quhilk
dred ye yat he should be of little pyssance in sc^tland (...) Robert Bruce gat
any auc^orite. At last king Edward schew yir (...) to the Bruce and demandit
him (...) he had any cognossance of his (...) writ. The Bruce denyit ^e
let^^ris with great constance, sch^wing the samyn proceeding only be Inuy of the
Cumyn. And yairfore desirit to be (...) with the letteris for ane ^icht, and
faileing yat he preuit not ye letteris falls and feneit. he should tyne al his
landis within Ingland. King Edward gaif little faith to thi^ let^e^is. for it
was ye will of god yt bruce should be sauit to recover ye realm of scotland out
of servitude and tyranny of Inglisme^. Ye earl of glomer sone after the
departing of Robert bruce fra the kingis presence, send to him (...).
striuelyng pe^nyis with.ii. scharp sputris. Throw quhilk the Bruce co^iecturit
yt na thing was proffitable to him bot to spur hes horse, and because the season
was than of winter and the erd ouircouerit with s^awis, he gart ane smyth scho
his horse bakw^rtis, that nane should follow him be his fut steppis. And departit
out of London with two traist seruandis in all deligence yt he micht and come
the.vii. day after to Lochmaben, quhare he me^ his brothir Edward quhilk had
great meruel of his haiste cummyng. And incontinent he schew how he come in great
trubyll be ye Cumyn, and narrowly eschapit of his life. In ye mean time as they
went forthwart, they met ane futman be the way. And because he eschewit the
gait, they tuke him. and fand new wrytyngis with him direckit fra the Cumin to
king Edward, quhilk schew gif ye Bruce were nocht slane, na thing bot
conspiration and truble sall follow in all partis of scotland aganis king
Edward. Als sone as the Bruce had red their writingis, he inquirit diligently
quhair the Cumin was. This seruand suspeekand na evil, schew yt he was in ye
freiris of Dunfreis. Ye Bruce incontinent slew yis man for bering of yir
writingis, and come haistly in the queir of Du^freis quhair he fand ye Cumyn,
and eftir yt he had accusit him and schawin his awin enventures, he straik him
with ane swerd in the wambe. Syne fled haistely out of ye kirk, and met James
Lindesay and Roger Kirkpatrik his tender freindis, and said to thaym. I trow
the Cumyn be slane. to quhome yai answerit, hes thou atte^ptit sa great ane
matter and left it vncertane. Incontinent yai went to ye Cumyn and inquirit him
gif he had any deidis wou^dis, or gyf he trowit to recouir gif he had any good
surrigiane, and because he said he mycht recouir, yai straik him.iii* or.iiii.
other straikis mair cruelly, and sone eftir he gaif the gaist, the eir of

How VVallace was be^r^^sit be schir Iohne Mentei^h. Of king Robert Brucia
coronatioun and of his great misery. How he conquest scotland. and how ye
Douglas tuk yair beginning. ca. viii.
AT these time Wallace was taken treasonably be schir John^ M^nteith at Glasgew,
and deliuerit to king Edward. For king Edward promittit be general edict syndry
landis with great sowmes of money to yame ye wald deliver y^ said Wallace i^ hes
ha^dis. Finaly these Wallace was brocht to London, quhare he was cruelly
martyrit be tyranny of king Edward, and hes quarteres se^d to sindry great
tounis of scotland to be hou^g up to his schame. This end maid ye nobil Wallace
may forcy campion yat was in his dayis. For yocht all other scottis randerit
both yame self and yair cuntre to servitude of Inglismen, he wald neuir be
subdewit, bot ay iosing the auld liberte of scotland. Nochtheles sic Inuy hes
ay been and is it in scotland, y^ na nobyll man may leif in it bot outhir be
ane treason or other finaly distroyit. It is writtin yat ane haly heremite in
Ingland reuist in spreit be heuinly contemplation saw this Wallace fleand with
inestimabyl glore unto ye heuyn, as he y^ faucht for defense of his cu^tre to
ye deith. Robert Bruce after ye slauchter of ye Cumyng send to the paip for
absolution, and to attempt ane thing of mair audacite aganis king Edward, be
quhilk he micht the better resyst his tyranny in times cumyng. He come with his
freindis to Scone, quhare he was crownit on the.xxvii. day of March. it quhen
he had gaderit al ye pepyl yt he micht to inuaid king Edward he was bot ane
small nowmer, for the may part of Scotland was aganis him. King Edward
aduertist of the rebellion maid aganis him be king Robert, send ane army in
scotland with Odomer wallance his lieutennent. and faucht with king Robert at
Meffene. ye.xix. day of Iuny, quhare ye said king Robert was put to flycht. And
youcht few of his army was slane at this time, it the pepil eid fra him
traisting ane evil sign to begin with sic discomfitour. Odomer wallance after
yis victory. banist all ye wiffis of yame ye a^sisti^ to king Robert. Throw
quhilk money noble women and ladyis war co^stranit to pas to ye desertis and
woddis to eschew ye cruelte of Inglismen. King Robert discomfist on this wise
come in Athole, quhare he faucht aganis ye Cumyngis and Inglisme^ and was put
to flicht on ye samyn manner as before. few of his men slane it be their frequent
discomfitouris he was sa desolate of freindis, yt he went solita^ with few
personis in his cumpany amang ye montanis and woddis su^^enand his miserable
life on ru^es and herbis, and in yis mischa^ce he had.ii. may faithful
seruandis to him ye earl of Leuenax and Gylbert Hay, and yocht s^^tyme b^ fers
persecution of ennimes yai went fra hi^ presence, it yai baid ay at his
opinion. At last al his fr^indis for feir of yair liuis skalit and fled heir
and their to their best refuge. His queen fled to sa^ct Dutho and was taken be
William Cuming earl of Ros, and deliuerit to ye king of Ingland, quhare scho
abaid co^tinewally to ye battal of Baunochtburn. His brothir Nigell Thomas and
Alexander war taken and su^ of yame heidit at Carlele, and sum as Berwik. Finaly
all they yat fled fra him war other slane within ye eir or ellis haldin
presoneris in Ingland. Thus was king Robert brocht to sic misery, yt he was
sumtyme nakit and hungery but meit or drink, saif only watter and ruris of
herbis, and youcht he knew weil ye slauchter of his brothir with all other
afflictionis done in perdition of him and his freindis. i^ he had sic excellent
fortitude in all aduersite, yat na thing mycht brek his invincible curage. For
he was sa accustomit with every truble and weiris in his outhe, that he curit
nocht to sleip on ye called erd, nor to drink watter in steid of aill or wine.
Attoure ane thing is yat apperis to have cumyn be miracle and grace of god,
howbeit his freindis war neir all vterly distroyit. He ceissit neuir to have
ferme esperance sumtyme to recover hes realm and lyberte of his pepyl. At last
quhen he had been vagabound and wylsum in sindry partis to eschew ye treason of
yame, quhilkis war waitand to put him to deith. He come to ane friend in the
Ilis, quhare he gat sic support of men and wappinnis yt he tuk new curage to
assail his ennymes. And be ye samyn way he tuke the castle of Carrik, and
slew all the Inglismen quhilkis were fu^din in it. Syne dealt the spule thairof
with great liberalite amang his we^rmen. His freindis (quhilkis war lurkand
under covert) herirand his doingis began to return to him out of al partis.
Sone after be their assistence he wan ye castle of Innernes, and slew al ye
sodiouris thairof, and with siclik felicite wa^ money str^ches in ye north. And
because he had na pyssance to keip thaym, he kest thaym down in all parts quhare
he eid. At last quhe^ he was cumand to Glennesk, he gat aduertising yt Iohne

seeing him na thing affrayit of their cumyng, send ambassa^oures to have trewis
to eschew the present dangeir, quhill they war gaderit mair strangly aganis
him. it quhen their desiris war grantit, they followit him with new power in
their may cruel manner. King Robert bure him sa vaileantly, yt oftymes be his
singular virtew he put yame to flycht, and maid ay slauch^ter on yame, howbeit
the samyn was bot small, as occurris oftymes at frequent scarmussing and
ieoperdis* ye fame of their honorable actis drew him in sic favor, that
syndry great baronis of scotland assistit to him. Amang quhome was James Douglas
ane man of great spreit and manheid, quhilk was tendir and familiar cousing to
Wyllyam Lambertoun bischop of sanct Andros. This James Douglas to support king
Robert at his power tuk all the bischoppis gold and horse with sindry other
vaileant ou^g men of his opinion, and went to king Robert, as byschop
Lambertoun had knawin na thing thairof. Howbeit he assistit weil yair to, bot
he durst not opinly, in adventure gif any infeliciteis had followit after, it
micht have cumyn to hes displeseir. This James Douglas was te^derly ressauit be
king Robert, and co^tinewit in his service both in weir and peace to the end
of his life. Of this James discendit ye illuster surname of Douglas. quhilkis
war euir the sicker targe and weirwal of Scotland aganis Inglismen, and wan
money la^dis be yair syngular ma^heid and vassalage. For it is said in ye bru^is
buke. Sa money good as of ye Douglas h^s been.

Of ane surname was neuir in Scotland seen.

For they decorit yis realm with money noble actis, and be glore of marciall
dedis grew in great estimation. Nochtheles their hicht and great pissance both
in manrent and landis was sa suspect to the kingis (quhilkes succedit after
yame) that it was the cause of their declination* and ^it sen that surname was
put down, scotland his done few vaileant dedis in Ingland. Bot we will return
to our h^s^orie.

Of the deith of the tyrane king Edw^^d langschankis. And how Edward Camauer
his son was maid king of Ingland. How king Robert gat sindry victory^^ on his
ennymes. And of (...) d^rth in Scotland. Ca. ix.
EDward of Ingland dredand the scottis be their feliciteis to rise ilk day in
i^ore insole^ce, come with ane more aufull ordinance than euir he did before in
scotland, with purpos to subdew it alluterlie but any recouir, and at his
cumyng to ye bordo^ris, he fell in ane heavy maledy, and deceissit suddanlie but
any confessioun or sacrament of haly kirk. Treuth is that ane knycht of Ingland
namyt schir William Banistar in ye hour of king Edwardis deith* fell in ane
ecstasy and saw this odius tyran cruelly ^eurgi^ for the murdir of sa money
innocent pepill. And finalie saw him c^nuoyi^ with infinite noumer of deuillis
to hell. Als sone as this knycht had seen this visioun, he fell in ane heavy
maledy and culd neuir (...) rest, quhill he was brocht to ane opin place before
al ye pepil to schaw his visioun. And quhen he had schaw^n the samyn to the
pepill with all circumstance before reheirsit, he conualescit and perfeuerit in
good life and penance to his deith. Yis apperis to be true, because this bludy
tyrane ragit with unnatural cruelte on cristi^^ pepil above ye rigor of arms.
for quhen he was i^ his last extremes he co^mandit.l. oung childrin quhilkis
were takin in ye castle of Kildru^my (eftir that it was won be Inglism^n) to be
all slane but any compassioun of their tendir ^eris and innocence. Eftir his
deith the nobillis of Ingland ^uk his s^n Edward ou^ of Carnauer and maid him
king. This Edward following ye futsteppis of his fader, su^mond all the lordis
of scotland to Dunfreis, quhare money of thaym were sworn to make homage and
faith to him as to yair superior and king. Otheris rebellit aganis him,
traisting be ye deith of king Edward, great dissentioun and trubill to follow in
England. For his son was oung and tuke na counsal of his lordis* bot
allanerlie of Peter Ganarstoun, quhilk was haitit both with Inglismen and
scottis* King Edward sone eftir returnit in Ingland, and send ambassatouris in
France, desiryng support to his weris. In ye mean time Iohne Cumin earl of
Buchquhan gaderit ane army of Inglisme^ and scottis aganis king Robert. And
yocht king Robert was in great infirmi^^, he com on ane horse litter to ye camp
aganis hes ennymes. The Cumyn with other scottis and Inglismen in great noumer
ab^id at ane strenth, traisting ^e yair only multitude to put king Robert
(...) flycht. Bot at last the Cumyn was discomfist, and money of his army slane
or ellis ta^e. This victory was gottin at Enuertour.x. mylis fra Abirdene, and
was sa plesand to king Robert, yt he gat his heil yairthrow. In the same eir
Donald of ye Ilis come with ane great power aganis king Robert and was
discomfist be Edward Bruce at ye watter of Deir. King Robert eftir sindry
chances of battall succeding to him with great felicite, come with ane army in
Argyle. And nocht only subdewit the cuntre to his opinioun. Bot tuke Alexander
lord of Argyle out of one strange castle thairof, and banis^ him with all his
freindis in Ingland, quhair he sone after deceissit. In ye same eir king Edward
come with ane army to Ra^frew, and returnit in Ingland with few works worthy to
have memory. And in this eir throw continewall weris raise sic derth in
scotland, that nothir vittallis nor bestial micht be gottin in any partis

King Robert in ye eir followyng. quhylk was fra the incarnatioun
ane.M.iii.C.xi. eris chasit Inglismen out of all partis (...) sco^land. Syne
enterit two sindry ^ymes in Ingland, and after that he (...) put money landi^
and pepyl thairof ^o heirschippis and slauchter, he returni^ in scotland with
innowmerabil ^iches, spule, and pray of besti^ll. Throw quhilk England was put
(...) na les affliction and trubyll, than ^cotland was in the eires before
reher^^^ be king Edward. And in the eir following on ye.viii. day of Ianuar
king Robert wan ye town of Perth be strange hand, and slew all the pepyll found
in it, and kest down all ye wallis yairof to the ground. And in ye sam^ eir y^
castellis of Dunfreis, Air, L^nark, with money ^thir strenthis and castellis in
Scotland war randerit to him, and cassyn down to ye ground. The castle of
Roxburgh was takin be schir James Douglas on fastronis even, fra our
redemptioun ane.M.iii.C.xiii. eris. And in ye samyn eir Thomas Randale earl of
Murray wan the castle of Edinburgh. And in this eir Edward Bruce segit the
castle of Striueling. And youcht he assaileit it with all ingyne and practik
yat micht tak any house, it his labor was in vane. For the castle was not
only strange be wallis, bot richt strenthy be nature of ye crag, standing on
ane hye mote quhare na passage was bot at ane per^. In this castle was ane
vaileant knicht schir Phillip Mowbray scottisman (howbeit he followit ye time
the opinioun of Inglismen) hauand sufficient vittallis to defend it lang time.
Edward richt sorrowful in his mind, and nocht knawing quhidder he should leif the
sege, or continue still to his importable expensis, thoucht richt degrading to
his honor (se^ he had ^ane sa great charge apo^ hand) to desist cowartly
thairfra. At last he tuke purpos to assail the mind of the said capitane* and
said gif he wald randir the house with pleseir, he should be als familiar to king
Robert, as he was before with king Edward. Fynaly because the capitane refusit to
^andir the house in this sort, he assaileit him on ane new burde. Howbeit ye
samyn succedit with mai^ felicite than prudence, gif the capitane gat na releif
of king Edward within ye eir nixt following, he sall randit the said castle to
scottis. This conditioun of peace was maid be Edward Bruce with great folly. For
ylk prudent man mycht belief the rich and pissant king of Ingland wald cum in
support of his matter, hauand s^ lang day to be prouidit thairwith. Attour it
was aganis the a^t of cheuelry to geif sa lang trewis, quhyll their ennymes
micht be sufficiently armit to inuaid thaym with battall. Howbeit their
conditionis of trewis ^ane be Edward Bruce were found rycht vnplesand to king
Robert, it he wald nocht be repugnant yairto. In adventure sum seditioun or
truble mycht follow thairefter be^^ix him and his brothir, and it he understood
the battall was to be led alwayis aganis the king of Ingland. In the mean time
king Edward send to all kyngis and princis that were alliat with him to have
support aganis ye scottis, promitting eftir his victory to divide Scotland
amang thaym. And thairfore nocht only the people that stude under his empire,
bot sindry other infinite pepill come with him on their auenturis. Specially
they that had bot small insycht at hame. Traisting to purches be his conques
and victory landis and riches sufficient to sustene their estait in times
cumyng. And in esperance thairof they brocht with thaym yair wiffis and
childrin with all the guddis quhilkis they mycht turs both on fute and horse.
Ye landis (quhare king Edward gat support to this battall) were their that
followis. Holland, eland, Brabane, Flanderis, Picardy, Bollony, Gascune,
Normandye with money other regionis, quhilkis were all that time other co^fiderat
with England, or ellis under their dominioun. And by thaym money scottis men
(quhilkis for the felicite succedyng to Inglismen) tuke part at yis time with
king Edward contrar their native prince. Ye noumer that come at this time in
Scotland with king Edward extendit to ane hundredth and fifty thousand fute men
with als money horse men. And by this, was infinite noumer of scudlaris and
car^age men with yair wiffis children, madinnis, and seruandis, as they were
sicker to sit down perpetually in Scotland. Throw quhilk the nowmer was sa great
that na ordour nor craft of cheualry mycht be obseruat amang thaym. For men,
wiffis, and childrin were all mixed togidder. Throw quhilk raise ane huge rei^d
and clamor in all partis quhare yai come, throw diversity of toungis. King
Edward be this incredible noumer of pepil richt proud and insolent tuke litill
solicitude or thocht of battall. For quhen he was approcheand neir ye merchis
of scotland, he tuke auisement with his nobillis with quhat cruel and schame
full torment he micht best punis king Robert and his nobillis, presuming be
vane arrogance to put thaym to pyne, as they had been sicker in his handis.
Attoure he brocht with him ane Carmelite monk to discriue his conques and
victory on Scotland. And nocht only the king, bot every man in his cumpany
vsit may detraction on the scottis. On y^ tothir side king Robert did all
thing with great prudence and industry, and with xxx.M. men feirs and weil
exercit in cheualry he come pertlie aganis his ennymes, and set down hes tents
with good array on ane plane above Banochburn. Uncertane quhethir he did yis for
the great confidence he had in his folkis. Or gif he did it to cause his ^ayis to
have him in na co^temption, and as he beleuit, so followit eftir. For quhen the
Inglismen began to wonder how he durst cu^ with sa small power aganis yair huge
ordinance. It was said be ane agit and wise capitane of Ingland. We will get na
victory this day but strange bergane and great murdir of pepill. For he knew
weill ye great wisdom and manheid of king Robert and his forcy campionis sa
lang exercit in cheualry. Forthir to strenth hes manheid with more crafty slycht,
he maid deip fowse^s in the place quhare the battall was set, and dang in
sta^kis with scharp pointis rising up, couerit with scherrettis* with sic
ingyne that fu^ men mych^ pas thairon but any dangeir, bot quhen any preis of
horse men come abone ye said fowseis, ye lofting should brek. And incontinent the
horsemen should other be reuin on staikis or ellis inclusit but any out passage.
Sic thingis done, he abaid still in ye said place abidyng with great curage the
cumyng of Inglismen. And quhen both the armyis were approcheing (...) other
within ane mile, king Edward send.viii.C. horsemen be ane (...) gait to the
castle of Striue^^^^ to adue^tis the capitane of his (...). Als sone as king
Robert (...) proceeding forthwart, he (...) Thomas Randale with.v. (...) laif
the cuntre fra their in (...), quhilk met their Inglismen (...) inc^^dible
manheid. Throw quhilki^ was touch^in cruelly with (...) victory la^g time in
ye face of ^aith y^ armies. In ye mean time schir James Douglas dred yat earl
Thomas his special and tender friend should (...) set be multitude of Inglisme^.
And incontinent he fell on kneis before king Robert desiring license to support
his friend. And because the king wald nocht condescend to his purpos sa haistely
as he desyrit, he ruschit out of ye army but any license with ane cu^pany of
chosin men to ye effect foresaid. At last quhen he was cumyng neir ye place
quhare the earl faucht, and saw ye victory inclinand to him with great murdir
of Inglismen, he stude still, that he should nocht be his cumyng ^eif fra his
tender friend ye glore of victory, quhilk he had conquest with sic felicite
and manheid. This victory was sa plesand to all the army of Scottis, yat every
man was spretit with new curage. Beleuyng with sicker esperance more felicite
hastily approcheing.

How the two kyngis exhortit ya^^ armyi^ to battall. How Inglismen vve^
discomfist at Banochburn. And king Edward chasit be the Douglas to Du^bar Of
great riches that fell to scottis be yi^ victory. How the town of Handvvarp
and flemingis tuk their beginning. Ca. xi.
THe Inglismen wa^ litil astonist of this disco^fitour. Howbeit they saw the
scottis do this vassalage be more ma^heid, than noumer of pepill. And to that
fine the scottis sall no^ht be insolent throw this said victory. Yat set
battal to fecht with yame on ye morrow. King Robert maid his folkis (youcht they
were in few noumer) reddy for battall in the samyn manner casting him money wayis
to bring his ennymes in the fowleis before deuisit. First he co^mandit the army
to make their confessionis and to be reddy on the morrow to ressaue ye blissit
sacrament eftir mess. Throw quhilk they mycht have the better esperance of
victory. On the tothir side the Inglismen be hie curage beleuit nocht bot huge
pray of landis and guddis to fall to yame for small laubour of ane day. All the
nycht before the battall, king Robert was rycht weary hauand great solicitude for
the weil of his army, and mycht take na rest, bot rolland all ieoperdeis and
chance of fortoun in his mind, and sum times he went to his deuoit
co^templatioun, makand his orisoun to god and sa^ct Phillane, quhais arm (as
he beleuit) set in silver was closit in ane cais within his paleon, Traisting
the better fortoun to follow be the samyn. In the mean time ye cais ^hakkit to
suddanlie but any motion or werk of mortal creaturis. The priest astonist be
this wounder went to the alter quhare the cais lay. And quhen he fand the arm
in the cais, he crijt, heir is ane great mirakle, and incontinent he confessit
how he brocht the tume cais in the field dredand yt the rillik should be tynt in
the field quhair sa great ieoperdeis apperit. The king reiosing of this
mirakill, past the remanent nycht in his prayaris with good esperance of
victory. On the morrow he gaderit al his army to mess to ressaue the body of
god to make thaym have the more curage aganis their ennymes. In this army was
ane deuoit man namit Maritius abbot of Inchechaffray, quhilk said mess on ane
hi^ mote, and ministerit the Eucharist to the king and his nobillis, and causit
his preistis to make ministratioun thairof to the residew of the army. Eftir
this king Robert callit ye pepill to his standart and said in this manner. I
belief (may forcy campionis) nane is ama^g ow nocht knawing how necessar it
is to ws to fecht this day aganis our ennymes. e se ane army gaderit aganis ow

they sall pyne ws or euir we be vincust or cum in yair ha^dis, not knawing our

campionis) they ar the refuse of all realms but any practik or experience of

quhilk is cumyn (as I belief) to our eiris. Yairfore I pray ow be of good

quhare god is concurrant, na multitude of ennimes may auail. And the more
noumer of pepil cumis aganis ow, the pray and riches sall cum to our more
proffet. On the tothir side king Edward prayit his folkis to remember gif they
faucht vaileant lie for ane hour or two, yai should have infynite riches, and ye
realm of scotland in reward of their laubour, of quhilk he desyrit nocht bot
the superiorite. Attour prayit yam to remember quhat irrecouerable schame should

How king Edward was discomfist be schir James Douglas. Of great vassalage
done be William Sinclar bischop of Dunkeld aganis Inglismen, and how Bervvik
was recouerit. Ca. xiii.
EDward king of Ingland heira^d ye passage of king Robert in Ireland, thocht
the time expedient to conques scotland, and come with ane greter power than
euir he did before. Nochtheles schir James of Douglas gouernoure gaif him battal
on the bordouris, and put him and all his army to flycht. Howbeit the victory
succedit not but infinite slauchter on athir side. In this battall schir James
Douglas slew three of ye may vaileant campionis of Ingland with his awin
handis. King Edward disparit for ye souerane ma^heid and wisdom of schir James
of Douglas to conques any honor in scotland be land, tuk purpos to assail the
same be se, and send ane flote of schippis in Forth, quhilk brint and heryit
the land on every side thaym about. Duncane earl of Fyf heirand yir cruelteis
done be Inglismen come with.v.C. bodyn men to resist yair inuasioun. Nochtheles
fra he saw yame of mair power tha^ he micht resist, he fled abak, In the mean
time met him William Sinclare bischop of Du^keld with.lx. weil armit men, and
finaly brocht him agane to ye same pla^e quhare the Inglisme^ war rynnand with

Bischop Sinclare for these honest vassalage was ay callit eft king Robertes
bischop. In ye same eir Robert Stewart son to Walter Stewart and Mariory Bruce

in this eir quhilk was fra our redemption.i.M.iii.C.xviii. eris. Earl Thomas
Ra^dal enterit in ye north pertis of England and returnit with great pray of men
and gudis but any trubyl to his army, and recouerit Berwik be industry of ane
Inglisma^ namit Spalden, be quho^ ye said town was recouerit after yt it had

Angus for ye samyn cause. In the eir following king Edward segit Berwik. Bot it
was sa vaileantly defe^dit, yt he returnit hame with small honor. At this time
Mariory Bruce king Robertis doucht deceissit. And sone after lang peace was
takin betuix Inglismen and Scottis.

Of the blak parliament. How king Edward co^planit to the paip for iniuris of
scottis. Of the orison maid be the papis legate to king Robert. And of his
answer. Ca. xiiii.
King Robert ha^and his realm but any trubyl of ennymes, held ane parliament
at Perth and desirit his lordis to schaw yair haldinges and charteris of yair
landis. The lords after lang auisement pullit out all yair swerdis at anis,
and said they had na other euidentis nor chartouris to schaw for yair landis.
King Robert was richt affrayit of this sicht. And howheit he tuke great
indignation and hatrent in his mind, he dissimilit ye samyn for ane time, and
said yai schaw yame nobil men, sen they wan and deba^^tit yair lands be ye
swerd, nochtheles he ^^re great hatrent aganis yame in his mind, and determit to
revenge yair proud co^temption quhe^ euir he fand sufficient oportunite.
Sindry of ye noblis aduertist yat ye king was mouit with great hatren^ aganis
yame, thocht best to attempt ane thing mair cruel aganis him before hes purpos
come to effect, and maid ane ba^d ama^g yame self to put him be adventure of sum
compasit sli^htis in king Edwardis handis* Yis treason was nocht lang hid to
king Robert. Nochtheles that the verite thairof should be the mair patent, king
Robert gart certane quiet person is ly be ye gait to ripe al passingeris to
wart the bordouris, to se gyf they micht find any letteris with thaym,
quhairthrow he mycht be ye mair surely aduertist of yair treason. It is said
ane palmer was send be their lordis to have passit to the king of England with
yair band, and had y^ samyn inclusit within ane staf, nochyeles he was taken,
and finaly brocht ye band of letteres co^tenand ye hail treason deuisit aganis
king Robert. Als sone as king Robert had visit ye letteres, he send for yir
noblis to cu^ to him with al deligence as ane great matter war occur^ant, quhilk
micht not be dressit but yair co^sultation. After yair cuming, he demandit yame
gif ya^ kend yair (...) writtis and selis. And because yat (...) not deny, they
war send to (...) castelles to remane in ward, quhil (...) forthir auisit. Sic
thingis done he went to Berwik, and co^man^^^ ane masar to arrest schir William
Soulis capitane yairof to his iusti^e. And because the masar for feir of this
great man was astonist, he pullit the mais fra him, and said to the capitane.
Tratour I arrest the. Thus was schir William taken and brocht to Perth. Nocht
lang after was ane co^uention of the lordis at Perth, call it the blak
perliament. Fra ye incarnation ane.M.iii.C.xx. eris. In ye first king Robert
accusit his sister son David Abirnethy. for he knew this treason, Howbeit he
assistit not yairto bot he wald not reuele it in time. The king wald fane yt he
had been saiffit. Nochtheles he was sa rigorus on the laif, that it micht not
be esaly done. And because na man laubourit for him, he was heidit with great
lament of pepyll. for he was haldin ye flower of cheuelry, and had fochty^ money
eris before with great honor and victory aganis the turkis. On the morrow all
the remanent conspiratouris war heidit on ye samyn manner but any m^rcy. At yis
time king Edward send wryttyng is to ye paip complening the iniuris done be
scottis, saying he was sa cruelly inuadit be thaym, that he mycht nocht pas
with his army aganis the turkis (as his eldaris did before) nor it cum out of
his realm to support or invade any other pepyll. And thairfore desirit the
papis halynes (gif h^ desirit peace amang cristin princis) to ^^is the wyld
fury of Scottis rageand with may cruelte aganes him. With their and siclik
wourdis he mouit the paip to great hatrent aganis the scottis. Howbeit he was
the haill occasioun of al weris betuix Ingland and scotland. Sone after ane
legate was send be the paip to king Robert complenyng the iniuris and trubyl
done be his pepyll aganis Inglismen. Saying ye cristin faith micht neuir be
sickir, sa lang as crystyn princis war at contynewall debait amang thaym self,
as weill apperit. For the great turk cruel and vnmercyful ennyme to cristin
pepyll, had conquest laitly great boundis of cristindome, and eikand daily his
empire with new conques. The legate after their wordis was remouit quhil the king
had taken auisement with his nobillis quhat was to be answerit in this matter.
The haill nobilite of scotland beand present at this conuentioun with lang and
degeist deliberation, concludit for mair dispite to inuaid Inglisme^ with new
army. And said* the wourdis of this legate war nocht worthy to have answer. For
ylk man mycht cleirly understand the paip was nocht sa myschant* bot he knew
weill ye motive of their w^ris, sen yair cause been s^ often deuoluit afor him ^
Inglismen continewaly set to conques their realm. Howbeit they had na just
tytyll nor clame thairto. For the crown of Scotland hes ben iosit with scot^is
in sic liberte, ye.lxxxxvi. kingis be lang progression hes linaly succedit to
they dayis, ay of ane blude but any interruption. Quhill laitly Inglismen
(quhen they saw ye succession of king Alexander fail) maid thaym to conques
the crown of scotland. And for that cause they wald first dant ye invasion of
Inglismen, and after that they wald be correckit at the papis mind. The legate
depeschit in these manner returnit hame but any expedition of his desiris.

SChort time followi^g king Robert enterit with ane army in Ingland, and
waistit all the landis thairof with fire and swerd quhi^ he come to the Re croce

hundredth thousand armit me^ on fute and horse. King Robert aduertist of his
cuming, gart bring all the cornis and bestial within strenthis, quhare they
micht not be gottyn to support the army of Ingland. At last the Inglismen come
to Edinburgh, bot ya^ war constranit within.xv. dayis to depart for penurite of
vittallis. and it within few dayis after they returnit in scotland, ^ c^^ssit
fra na manner of cruelte on the pepil thairof. They spuleit the abbay (...)
Melros, and slew sindry agit monkis. They spuleit ye eucarist out of ye ^ais of
silver, quhairit hang, and kest it in ane trein kissed, co^parit justly to barnis
of Lucifer, quhilkis intendit to spule god out of his awin house. Attoure they
brint Driburgh with money other religious abbayis and places. King Robert to

and put his army to flycht with great slauchter both of Inglismen and
Normandis. Of quhilkes money war takin and ransonit with great sowmes of money.
This battall was strokyn fra our redemption.i.M.iii.C.xxiii. eris. Nocht lang
after king Robert send ane ambassatoure to renew the band betuix france and

of nobil bl^de namit Hantoun to eschew ye hatrent of king Edward, fled to king
Robert in scotland. Yis Ha^toun eft ye battal of Banochburn was in ye king of
Inglandis house at London, and had ane syngulare favor to king Robert, oftymes
aua^sing his great manheid and virtew. Quhill at last Iohne Spensar rich^

because he was consultit be his freindis to eschew ye kingis hatrent, he fled

RObert the recouerer of S^otla^d after money his illuster dedis for the publik

schir James Douglas i^ France to solist Iohne Ballioll to transfer his ^icht in
king Robert and his airis, and to geif the Balliol both money and landis in
scotland for his richt. It is said the Balliol at the cumyng of schir James was
fallyn blind be lang age. And said, that he was ay vnabyl to have gouernit the
realm of Scotland, and name sa abyll as king Robert hes cousing, quhilk had sa
vaileantly defendit it fra may cruel ennymes. Incontinent the Balliol callit
his freindes before him, and transferrit all richt and clame yt he had or micht
have in and to ye croun of scotland in ye said king Robert and his airis
quhatsumeuir. Desyryng na thing sa mekyl as him and his aires to regne in
perpetual felicite. King Robert heirand ye returnyng of schir James Douglas
with good expedition of his ma^eris, conuenit all his noblis to ane counsall at
Cambusk^neth, and maid new ta^^e to his son David in yis manner. gif his son
David dece^^^it but airis of his body, hes nepot Robert Stewart gottin on
Ma^iory bruce hes doucht sal succeid to ye croun, al ye noblis were sworn to
defend these new tail. In ye mean time king Edward send his ambassatouris in
scotland desiryng peace. Howbeit it was under dissait. For nochtstandyng the
peace co^trackit be him, he inuadit scotland with continewal weris. Nocht lang
after king Robert fell in great infirmite, and gaif ouir the governance of the
realm to earl Thomas Randall and schir James Douglas. For they war.ii. of ye
may nobill knychtis in the world. Their two chiftanis enterit in
Northumberland with.xxv.M. men. Aganis quhome come king Edward with.i.C.M. men.
Nochtheles their two campionis gouernit their army with sic manheid and wisdom
that they waistit all ye cuntre quhare yai come, and returnit but any damage
in scotland. King Edward to resist their incursionis, come with ane.C.M. men in
scotland, and wrocht great cruelteis quhare they come. To yat fine, that the
scottis should come in defense of their landis and guddis. At last quhen they had
live three dayis at ye watter of Tyne and mycht not cum ouir. For it was rysin
above the brayis. Tythingis come yat al Northumberla^d was brint and heryit be
scottis, and ye forray passand sa fast throw the cuntre but any residence, yt
na man wist quhare to find yame. In the mean time were send out exploratouris on
swift horse to se quhair the scottis were, and fand thaym within three mylis to ye
tentis of Inglismen arrayit on ane hill reddy to fecht. Edward rasit his tentis
incontinent, and come fornens the scottis. On the moro^ both ye armyis were
arrayit in vtheris sycht. The scottis beand of small noumer in regard of
Inglismen, stude arrayit at ane great strenth on the hill. At last quhen
Inglismen had stand all day and durst nocht brek their array, they returnit to
their palonis. And send ane herald to scottis desiring yame (gif yat durst
fecht) to cum to the planis, quhare they mycht have battal. As it had been na
prudence to capitanis to garnis their army with may ordour and munition that
mycht be deuisit. And quhen ye armyis had stand three nychtis in athir sycht,
and durst nocht inuaid other, they returnit to their tentis. Eftir ye both ye
armyis had standin lang time arrayit in other sycht on this manner, Schir James
of Douglas tuke purpos to assail ane matter of great vassalage. And incontinent
he chesit.ii.C. rycht vaileant and deliver men with swift geldingis, and
slippit quietly by the wache of Inglismen, quhilkes were at that time all on
sleip except ane certane, quhilkis were awalkenit be din of horse feit. Thus come
the Douglas but any noyis to king Edwardis paloun. And were nocht the army of
Ingland raise the more hastily on him, he had slane the king, for he cuttit.ii.
towis of his tent and returnit to the army of scottis but any damage to him or
his folkis. Ye Inglismen eftir this effray were the more vigilant in times
cuming. For they had been alluterlie discomfist, gif the army of scottis had
inuadit thaym the said nycht. The Scottis traisting yis vassalage sufficient
for this time, returnit hame but any displeseir. Als sone as Inglismen were
aduertist that the scottis were departit, they come haistely to ye place quhare
their tentis lay in esperance of sum rich spule, and fa^d.x.M. pair of hieland

ye.xxiiii. eir of his regne, fra our redemptioun.i.M.iii.C.xxix. eris. Ane of
ye may vaileant princis that was in any part of the world in his dayis,
hauand experience both of good and evil fortoun. His realm beand ty^e and all
his brethir slane except hes brothir Edward, he perseuerit with sic manheid and
invincible spreit, yat he recouerit his realm and liberte, quhen money of all
the great baronis of scotland were aganis him. Attoure he was in na les honor
and apprising amang his ennymes, yan amang his freindes. For king Edward
happinnit to co^moun at ane sole^pnit banker of sindry vaileant princis
concerning ye glore of arms and cheualry. And quhen the noblis were disputand
in sindry purpos yairof, they fell at ane question. quhilkis were ye three may
vaileant and forcy campionis leiffand in yair dayis. Eftir lang contentioun
they proponit yis questioun to be discussit be ane herald that was king of
arms. The king of arms was rycht stupefact with the residew of the heraldis.
For nocht allanerlie the king bot money of the nobillis that were with him,
beleuit for their singular manheid to be noumerit amang yi^ three. Howbeit it
happinnit far fra their purpos. For this herald knew nocht only all the
nobillis of Ingland, bot all other nobillis and vaileant princis of the world
quhare he trauellit, hauand al their dedis in recent memory. The first may
vaileant campioun (said the herald) was Hary ye emprioure. For he subdewit three
kyngis and three realms, and debaittit his imperial dignite, with good felicite
to the end of his life. The secound was schir Gelis of Argenty, because he was
victorious in three sindry battallis aganis sarazenis, and slew three of their
principal capitanis with his awin handis. The third (gif it war nocht
displesant to his prince to schaw the verite) was Robert Bruce king of
Scotland. Incontinent raise ane huge noyis and clamor with all ye pepyll their
present. Because the herald sa per^ely schew the verite but any feir in presence
of his prince. Than said the herald, I beseik thy hienes (gif I have nocht
faileit) to take my declaratioun in na displeseir. For gyf it be necessar to
any man to be vincust. It is les dishonor to be vincust with him that is may
vaileant, than with him that is may cowart. Attoure to schaw ow how far I
auance the great manheid of king Robert. Quhilk e may evil suffer to be nowmerit
with their two first campionis. Howbeit gyf the verite war schawin, we mycht
prefer him weill to the two may vayleant campionis before rehersit. For ye
great actis and vaileant dedis done be Hary empriour war nocht done be his awin
manheid and prudence, bot erar be counsall of his nobillis. Be contrar Robert
was exilit his realm, and recouerit it only be his manheid, contrar the great
pyssance of thy nobyll fader and money of all the great baronis of Scotland. And
fynaly stabyllit it with sic tranquillite, that he apperit mair terribyll to
his ennymes of Ingland and otheris his inuasouris, than euir his ennymes war
before to his subdittis. Attoure nane is on live that will reproach his honor
or will deny their premissis. Bot he will preif the samyn with his handis in
singular battall, and the honor to be adiugit to him that is victorious.
Attoure he had sic incredybyll manheid and strenth, yat nane was in hes realm
that durst move any rebellioun aganes him. King Robert schort time before his
deith gaderit all his nobyllis to ane counsall, and commendit to thaym the
governance of his son David. For he had that time bot seuyn eris in age, and
gaif his counsall before his deith to yame of syndry hi^ materis concerning the
governance of Scotland. First he counsallit thaym neuir to make ane lord of the
Ilis. For the pepyll thairof ar ay flowand in their myndis, and sone brocht to
rebellyoun aganis the king. And fra they fall thairintyll, It is extreme
lauboure to dant thaym for ye great straitnes of land and s^is. Secoundly neuir
to set battall with Inglismen, nor to ieoperd the realm upon the chance of ane
battall. Bot to resist Inglismen erar he frequent s^armussyng than any set
battall. To that fine, gyf Scottis be discomfist, they may have sum pyssance to
resist their ennymes. Thridly he inhibit that scottis take any lang peace with
Inglismen. For the ingyne of man growis dull and febyll be lang sleuth. And for
laik of use and experience they may nocht sustene great chargis of battall,
specially quhen they ar effeminate with lang peace. And sen so is ye Inglismen
kepis neuir peace to Scottis (quhen they se any auantage) he thoucht best neuir
to have peace with Inglismen above three or four eris. And quhen lest occasion
of battall appe^is ^e Inglismen, to be than may vigilant, in adventure their
ennymes cum on thaym but any aduertysyng. And because he maid his solemn vote
to pas with ane army in defense of crystyn faith aganis the turkis. And was
preuenit be Untimus deith. He left his heart to Crist. And chesit his true
knycht schir James Douglas to pas with it to the haly graif, howbeit his
presence had been may necessar for defense of this realm. And for this cause
the Douglas bure ye bluddy heart in their armis. And (...) heir endis the
fourtene buke of their croniklis.

Heir begynnis the.xv. Buke of the croniklis of Scotland:
How schir James of Douglas past with king Roberti^ ha^^ to the haly graif.
Of the coronatioun of king David Bruce, and how earl Thomas Randale was maid

QUhen schir James Douglas was chosyn as may worthy of all Scotland to pas
with king Robertis heart in the haly land. He put it in ane cais of gold with
arromitike and precious vnementis. And tuke with him schi^ Wyllyam Synclare,
and schi^ Robert Logan, with money other nobyl men to the haly graif. Quhare he
buryit the said heart with may reverence and solempnite that culd be deuisit.
Sic thyngis done, he went to other cristin princis, quhilkis war gaderit with
great armyis fra syndry partis of crystyndome to weir aganis the turkis. And be
his syngular vassalage he dantit nocht only the ennymes of Crist. Bot be his
frequen^ victoryis wan great honor to all crystyn pepyll. At last quhen he had
completit all chargis commandit be his souerane with na les honor than
magnificence, he pulli^ up salis to have returnit in Scotland. And in the mean
time be contrarius wyndis he was dryuyn on ane angyll of Spane. Quhare he fand
the king of Aragon reddy to fecht aganis the sarazenis, quhilkis war cumyn with
great nauyis to invade his realm. The Douglas to make his manheid and syngulare
virtew patent in all partis quhare he come, went to the king of Aragon, and
faucht in his support at sindry ieoperdyis with great felicite, quhill at last
hauand ouir great confidence in fortoun, quhilkis bryngis money nobyl men to

accustomat before. And in the mean time ane buschement of turkis (quhilkis warly
and before at wait) come on him with displayit baner. And yocht he was of few
nowmer, he schrinkit nocht bot faucht obstinatly with perseuerant manheid to
the deith. And was slane ye.xxvi. day of August. fra our redemption ane

may vaileant knycht that was in his dayis, quhylk had been rycht necessar for
defense of the commoun weil of scotland, gyf he had been fortunat to return.
He was.lvii. sindry times victorious on Inglismen and.xiii. times on the turkis
as is wryttyn at lenth in Scoticronicon. Bot we will return to our history.
After the deith of king Robert, his son David hauand bot.viii. eris of age
was crownit at Scone ye.xxiiii. day of November. Fra the incarnatioun a^e
thousand three hundredth.xxxi. eris. And because he was vnabyll to govern ye
realm be his tender age, Earl Thomas Randale was maid gouernoure. Earl Thomas
seeing the pepyll brokyn with lang weris, thoucht may expedient quhill they
war sum partis enrichit in their gudis to have peace with Ingland. Belyue
ambassatouris war dereckit be him in Ingland and purchest peace for three eris.
In the mean time Earl Thomas gave his ingyne to govern the realm in equite
and peace. And to that fine the pepyll mycht leif but any feir of ennymes or
theuis to invade thaym in their landis or guddis. He commandit that sadyllis,
brydyllis, and all other instrumentis pertenand to the use of husbandry sal ly
their forth both day and nycht. Gyf any of thaym war stollyn or taken away, the
schiref of the schire sall cause the samyn other to be restorit to the aw^aris,
or ^llis to pay it on his awin puts. Fynaly sic extreme punitioun was maid on
theuis, that both thift and ^ykry war dantit in all partis, and the realm
brocht to mair tranquillite than euir it was in any kingis time before. Money
insolent and wild men war dantit be his seuerite and Justice. Attoure that
virtew should be autorist in this realm, he commandit na vagabound nor ydill
pepyll to be ressauit in any town without they had su^ craft to debait their
leuyng. Be this way he purgit the realm of money ydill lymmaris. It is said sic
seuerite and Justice was in his time, that ane ca^le (because he mycht nocht
steill other mennis guddis) stall his awin pleuch yrnis that he mycht have the
valor their of recompensit to him be the schiref* Nochtheles sic extreme
dilygence was maid in serchyng of his pleuch yrnes be the schiref, that they
war fynaly found with him self. And for that cause he was hyngit eftir. Earl
Thomas (seand how difficyl it was to bring thaym fra stouth that hes been
hantit thairwith) held ay with him ane guard of bodin men. Throw quhilk he
punist the rebellyoun of lymmaris in all partis of the realm. All personis that
competit to his Justice war punist with mercy. Otheris (that war found
rebelland thairto) war other slane or taken after be his guard, as hapnit nocht
lang after at Halydon, quhare three score of men war gaderit togydder inuading
the pepyll with reiffis and iniuris. And because they contempnit his offyciaris
after that they war summond to compere to his Justice, they war all taken be his
guard and hynggit on Iebatis. Throw this Justice na rebellyoun was seen in this
realm money eris after and sic tranquillite, That nocht allanerly theuis and
lymmaris war dantit. Bot the realm incressit with riches to ye great terror of
their fais. King Edward seeing this great felicite succedyng to Scottis, and
dreda^d thaym to revenge auld iniuris be singular ma^heid and prowes of this
earl Thomas, thocht na thing sa good as to attempt the thing be slicht that he
micht nocht do b^ force, y^ eft deith of earl Thomas ye realm of scotland myt
be patent to hes iniures. For king David was oung and money of his nobillis
mouit in great hatren^ aganis his house for the slauchter of their faderis in ye
blak parliament. And thairfore he tuk co^sultation be quhat ingyne and slycht
he mycht best distroy earl Thomas. At last he ^uk purpos to sla him be vennome.
And because it was dangerus to attempt this matter be ane Scottisma^ ^or re^eling
of his treason be sum adventure, he thocht it necessar to have (...) man of great
spreit, quhilk couth ^^ssimill, saying ane thing with his mouth quhilk he
thocht neuir with his heart. And quhen he had serchi^ ^ang, he fand nane sa
abyll to bring his purpos to effect, as ane monk. ^or oftymes men of that
ordoure hes ^s respect to schame nor Justice. Bot clokis their wickit lyffis
under fenei^ schaddow of ane co^le. Schortly he iustruckit yis monk (as he had
been ane medcin^^ (hauand special remeidis aganis the gravel. For in that
infirmite earl Thomas was heuely torm^ntit. King Edward co^mandit this monk to
use vennomus potionis amang his other seropis. And promittit (gif earl Thomas
was slane be his industry to reward him may richely. This monk instruckit in
this wise at his cumyng in Scotland* feneit him to have knawlege of money
nobillis both in Ingland and France. And nocht only curit thaym of syndry
grauellis, bot be his crafty potionis brak confermit stanis and hes curit money
and diverse pepyll of their infirmyteis. Forthir he was informit that earl
Thomas ane of the may vaileant princis of the world was heuely pinit with the
said maledy. Nochtheles gyf the said earl wald use counsall, he should be
delyuerit within schort time of all maledy. This monk had ane other lymmar
instruckit with him in the same manner to be his colleig. Quhylk schew in all
partis quhare he went, that his companeoun past all men in practik and science.
This monk was fynaly sa co^mendit that he was brocht to earl Thomas, and
inquirit be him, gyf he culd cure his maledy or releif him of his insufferahyll
dishonor. The monk tuke him gladly on hand. And as he was instruckit, he
commandit the earl to observe ane diet, sone eft he gaif him soft seropis. And
quhen he was admittit to mair familiarite, he gaif him ane vennomus potioun
(Howbeit the vennome was nocht haiste deid bot erar to consume ane man with
lang process). This monk (after that earl Thomas had drunkin the ^ennome to find
occasioun to get away) said, he had ane syngulare medcine in Ingland, quhilk
was neuir vsit be him bot quhen all other medcyne ^aileit. Thus fand he
occasioun to depart in Ingland, and promittit to return in scotland with all
deligence. Nocht lang eftir yis monk returnit to king Edward and said. Now sen
I have done all thy chargis as thou deuysit, best is to raise thy army in haist,
that thou may be in S^otland in the trubyl of his deith* and conques the realm
as thou list. In the mean time earl Thomas ^and certane dolouris ylk day mair
incressing in hes wambe, and because he herd tell ye king Edward was cuma^d with
ane army aganis him and na returnyng of ye monk at his set day, he tuke ane
vehement suspitioun of his treason. And fand sone after be the medcinaris, yat
ye vennome was sa sunkin in his bowellis, yat it was nocht remedable. And
howbeit he mycht nocht ride nor gang to meit king Edward, he gart turs him in
ane cheriot. The motive that king Edward had to raise weir at this time as he
allegit, was for falt of redres on ye bordouris. King Edward aduertist that
earl Thomas was cu^mand in arrayit battal to meit him, send ane herald in
Scotland to treit peace. Howbeit he was send erar to espy how all materis
stude, than to any other purpos. Earl Thomas heirand the cumyng of this herald
arrayit him in his best abulement, and sat in ane chiar dissimuland his great
infirmite, as na thing had ^lit him. Belyue the herald was brocht to his
presence, and schew his message. At last quhen the herald had desyrit certane
thyngis nocht respondent to reason, earl Thomas answerit. I sall schaw sone
quhat rycht Inglismen hes to sic wickit and iniust petitionis. And quhen he had
depeschit the herald with his answer, he gaif all the precious abulementis (as
he was arrayit for the time) to the herald. Sone after this herald returnit to
king Edward and said, he saw neuir ane mair lusty nor vaileant prince, than was
the said earl Thomas. King edward herand that earl Thomas was in good heill,
scalit his army, and beleuyng that the monk had nocht done sic chargis as he
promittit, he gart brin him according weill to his demeritis* In the mean time
earl Thomas returnit hame, and deceissit at Mussilburgh, and was buryit in
Dunfermeling. fra the incarnation ane.M.iii.C.xxxi. eris.

How the erlis of March and Mar was maid gouernouris of Scotland. How
Edward Ballioll come in Scotland to co^ques the croun* and of the batrall of
Duppline. Ca. ii.
Earl Thomas deceissit in yis manner, ane counsall was set be the noblis, in
quhilk be general votis of the three estatis Patrik earl of March, and David
earl of Mar war chosyn gouernouris. The first to govern the realm on the
south side on Forth. And the tothir to govern the north side. Sic thyngis done
raise great trubyll in Scotland be Edward Ballioll before rehersit in manner
followyng. Tha^r was ane wykit li^mare namit Twyname Lorison, quhilk was
oftymes dila^it of adultry, and haldin be the official of Glasgew money eris
under censuris of the kirk. At last he tuk the official passand to the town of
Air, and held him in captivity quhil he payit two hundredth pound Striuelyng.
Bot this oppressyoun was nocht vnpunist. For he was s^ scharply persewit be
schir James of Douglas before his passage to the haly land, that he fled in
Ingland, quhare he met David Cumyn earl of Atholl with money other Scottis
quhilkis war banist before be king Robert, for their assystance to the king of
Ingland. Their lymmaris confiderat all togydder under ane band, abayd lang time
in Ingland. And fra they war aduertyst of the deith of earl Thomas Randale and
schir James Douglas, they went in france to Edward Ballioll, and persuadit him
be money reasonis to cum in scotland to recover his faderis heritage and crown.
The Ballioll persuadit be their wordis (howbeit he had na sicht before to ye
crown of scotland) come in Ingland to seik support at king Edward. for he knew
Inglismen ay ennymes to scottis, and promittit to king Edward (gif al materes
succedit with felicite) to hald the realm of scotland of him as superior
thairof. King Edward glaid of this condition nochtwithstanding ye peace before
contrackit and the marriage of his sister maid before with king David of
scotland, send.vi.M. men weill prouydit with schippis to pas with him in
scotland. Traisting after his cumyng to find money other freindis yat wald
assist to him. And as we schew before, money scottis war in Ingland with the
Balliol, quhilkis informit him (gif he arriuit in scotland) money of all the
lordis yairof wald assist to his opinion. Balliol persuadit be their reasonis,
arriuit at Kingorne, quhare he brocht all his folkis on land, and sone after
slew Alexander Seytoun and put his folks to flicht. The Balliol proud of this
victory, come with his folks to Perth. The erlis of Mar and March aduertist of
his cumyng* rasit two great armyis and come aganis him, not as yai had been to
fecht aganes weirmen, bot allanerly as they were to punis certane theuis or
lymmaris of Ingland. At last they concludit to co^uene both togidder in
Strathern that they mycht invade their ennymes at anis. The Ballioll (howbeit
he knew his ennymes cumand with mair power tha^ he mycht resist) was na thing
affrayit. For ye matter was sa far procedit, that na feir of deith nor fleing
mycht auale. Nochtheles he beleuit (gif his army faucht with perseuerant
Constance) to have victory be su^ chance of fortoun. Alwayis he set down his
tentis at Dupline nocht far fra the water of Erne. In the samyn nycht ye earl
of Mar come with great multitude of pepyl and parkit yame i^ ye sicht of
balliollis army, bot the earl of March lay at Othirardour. The scottis seand
their ennymes of sa few nowmer, held thaym in co^temption, and pretermittit
yair wache, passing the nycht with syngyng, dansyng, reuelling, and drinking.
Their doingis succedit the mair unhappily, that they war done with sa manifest
contemption in the face of their ennymes. Be contrar ye Inglismen richt
circumspect and vigilant had sic spyis, yt every thing done or said in the army
of scottis was manifest to thaym. The balliol reiosing of this vane and
insolent folly amang scottis, commandit his army to be reddy to invade their
fais. In the nycht followyng, he come but any noyis to ye watter of Erne, and
fand ye furd thairof be ane lang staik, quhilk was affixit in the myddis yairof
be Andro Murray of Tullibard. Be this treason he led all his army ouir the
watter of Erne, and come sa quietly to the earl of Marris tentis, yat he slew
him sleipand in his bed. Incontinent with huge clamor he come upon ye remanent
army of scottis, and slew yame burit in sleip but any defense. Followit sa
cruel slauchter, that nocht was hard bot rummissing and granis of deand
pepyll. And had nocht been Edward balliol gart ylk man in his army bynd ane
quhit clout on his arm, na man mycht have knawin for myrknes of nycht quha was
freindis or fayis. The Inglismen war infla^mit in sic Ire, that they couth
nocht be saciar with blud and murdir of scottis, and sauit nane that mycht be
ouirtaikin. Money of ye nobillis were slane to ye noumer of.iii.M. with great
noumer of co^monis. Ane certane of thaym (quhilkis eschapit fra this battall)
returnit agane to revenge the murdir of their freindis, and were all slane. Ye
principal noblis (quhilkis were slane in this field) were the earl of Mar. Robert
Bruce earl of Carrik, Alexander Fraseir knycht, William Hay constable with all
his kyn sa halelie, yat were nocht his wife was deliuerit of ane son, all his
surname had been al vterlie distroyit. Robert Keith merscheall with money of his
surname* David Lindsay of gle^nesk, Alexand Seiton, George du^bar, Robert
strathaquhen, Thomas Haliburtoun and Iohne Skrymgeour knychtis with money
otheris quhilkis were ouir prolixt to schaw. The earl of Fiffe was taken. This
battall was strikin on ye third day of August. Fra our
rede^ptioun.i.M.iii.C.xxxii. eris.

How Edvvart Ballioll was crounit at Scone how king david fled in france.
how Perth was recouerit* and the ballioll vincust be the Douglas. and how
king Edward segit Bervvik. Ca. iii.
DUplyne disco^fist (as said is) the Balioll went to Perth and tuke it with
small difficulte. It is said that sindry Inglismen for auld hatrent aganis
scottis went eftir their victory to Duplyne to se gif any scottis were liand in
the field abill to recover, gif yai had good surrurgianis that yai mycht chase
out the residew of their life. Nochtheles seeing the miserable slauchter that
was maid on thaym in ye nycht before, they fell in great comploratioun, saying
they beleuit nocht sa infinite noumer of scottis slane. The earl of March
h^rand the scottis discomfist sa miserably at Duplyne, come with four great
cumpanyis to sege ye town of Perth. At last quhen he had live certane time at
the sege yairof. The fowseis brand filled, and the town reddy to be randerit in
his handis. He skalit fra the sege. Howbeit he mycht haif had the town and the
battall both at his pleseir. The Ballioll incontinent (because the people come
fast to his opinioun) come with the bischop of Du^keld and the earl of Fiffe to
S^one, and was crounit the.xxiiii. day of September in the eir before rehersit.
Be discomfitoure of yis last battal raise so great trubil in scotland, ye king
David haua^d bot.ix. eris i^ age be counsall of his freindis fled in France with
hes queen Jane sister to king Edward and was tenderly ressauit be Phillip
the.vi. king of France of yat name, quhare he remanit.ix. eris. In the nixt eir
Robert Keyth, Alexand Lindesay with other sindry nobillis to revenge the
slauchter of their faderis at Duplyne, wan the town of Perth the fourt month
eftir their sege. The earl of Fiffe and Androw Murray of Tullibard were taken with
otheris their complicis quhilkis kepit the said town in name of the Ballioll.
The earl was send in ward to Kildru^my. Bot Andro Murray for his treason before
co^mittit was hedit. The town eftir yt it was taken in this manner, was geuin in
keiping to Iohne Lindesay. The winnyng of this town be sic manheid and virtew
put the scottis in esperance of better fortoun. And yairfore Iohne Randale earl
of Murray son to earl Thomas before rehersit, and Archebald Douglas lord of
Galloway and brothir to James Douglas slane laitlie in Spane come with ane great
cumpany aganis the Ballioll. The Balliol weil aduertist yairof, met yam in
Annandale quhair it was cruelly fochtin. Bot at last the Ballioll was
discomfist. And him self chasit on ane horse but bridil to Roxburgh. In yis
battall were slane schir Henry Ballioll, schir Iohne Mowbray, Walter Cumyn and
Richard Kirklie, Alexander Bruce earl of Carrik and lord of Galloway were taikin
presoneris and saiffir be ye earl of Murray. For they were nocht lang before at
ye opinioun of Ballioll. Eftir this victory Andro Murray ane man of great
pissa^ce and rentis, was maid governor to be colleig to ye earl of March. Their
two gouernouris knawyng king Edward to cum aganis yame with all the power of
Ingland, send schir Alexander Seitoun with money other gentil men to keip
Berwik. Sic thingis done Andro Murray come with ane army to sege Roxburgh and
faucht sa vaileantly, yat he put the Balliol to flycht. Nochtheles he followit
so feirslie, that he was taken and brocht presonere within the castle. At this
time William Douglas of Liddisdale callit for his singular manheid ye flour of
cheualry faucht unhappily aganis Inglisme^ in Annandale, quhare he was taken
presonere, and his folkis discomfist. This William was son to good schir James
Douglas before rehersit. Both their nobill men were redemit with great soumes of
money, eftir that yai had been haldin other half eir in Ingland. The realm
standing thus in ieoperdy, the pepill were deuidit in two partis. The taken half
assistit to the Ballioll, and the tothir to king David. King Edward of Ingland
seeing sa great truble in Scotland, thocht the time sufficient to co^ques the
croun. For he vnderstud na thing sa difficill, bot it may be done other in all
or in sum part, gif it be often assaileit. And nochtwithstanding his band of
peace and marriage of his sister Jane with king David of scotland before
contrackit, he gaderit ane army both of Ingland, Normandy Angeos and flanderis
wagit be his money. And come in Scotland, specially quhare may rebellioun
was aganis ye Balliol. He schew that he was cumyn in support of Ballioll.
Nochtheles gif all thingis had succedit as he desirit. He wald na mair have
kepit faith and promise to the Ballioll, than to otheris. The Scottis seeing
thaym neir ouirset on al sidis with ennymes, send Iohne Randale earl of Murray
in France to king David to get sum support fra king Phillip of France to debait
his realm. At this time king Edward segit Berwik both be see and land.
Nochtheles the scottis debaitit it als vaileantlie as he assaileit. and nocht
allanerlie Ischit sindry times on Inglisme^, bot slew sindry of yair wachis.
And sum times brint their schippis with great manheid. In the mean time William
Seitoun son to schir Alexander before rehersit, followit sa feirslie at ane
scarmusche aganis Inglismen, yat he was takin. His bastard brothir ane man of
singular manheid inuading ouir feirslie the Inglis schippis under nycht fell
in the sea, quhare he perist. The sege continewit four monethis continewallie
about the town and maid great penurite of vittallis. At last schir Alexander
Seitoun send his son to king Edward, promittyng (gif he wald ceis the sege)
to rander the town to him within.vi. dayis* gif na support come to him within
the said time* And for the sickir observation of his promys, he left his son
and air in pledge.

Of the orison maid be Alexander Seitonis wife, and how his son was slane be

SIc thingis done at Berwik, the nobillis of Scotland be yair conuention maid
Archebald douglas governor in Androw Murrayis place. The Douglas to raise the
sege of Berwik, come with ane army in England. King Edward aduertist thairof,
send ane herald to schir Alexander Seiton certifying him, gif the town were
nocht randerit in haist, both his sonnis should be haistelie hingit before his
eyne. Alexand answered yat ye dayis were nocht out run of trewis, and desyrit the
king other to keip his faith, or ellis to deliver his pledgis that he mycht be
at his auantage. King Edward haua^d na sycht to his faith nor band, gart raise
haistelie ane gallous before the town, and have both the sonnis of Alexander
thairto. Ane of yame was taikin presonere, and that other deliuerit in manner of
pledge, as we haif schawin. Alexander seeing his so^nis led on this manner to ye
gallous, was mouit be great co^miseration, thinka^d it was ane thing rycht
detestable and odious that his sonnis should be sa innoce^tlie slane, considering
he mycht saif thaym gif he were obeysant to ye pleseir of ye tyrane. And sa be
co^miseration of his sonnis on yat ane part and faith promittit to the king and
his realm on the tothir side, he was often drawin in sindry purpos, and mycht
skarslie refreine him self fra randeryng of the town. it it is vncertane bot be
compassioun of his sonnis and natural affection, he had been obeysant to the
desire of king Edward, were nocht his wiffe and mother to his sonnis (ane wise
woman above the spreit of man) exhortit him oftymes erar to suffer the
immolatioun and murdir of his sonnis, Yan to commit sa manifest treason aganis

How the scottis war discomfist at Halidon hill and Bervvik was randerit to
Inglismen. with money other strenthis and munitionis of Scotland. Cap^. v.
ARchebald Douglas gouernoure of Scotland heirand this schamefull cruelte done
be king Edward, come on the third day after with his army fra Northumbirland to
revenge the displeseir thairof, and set down his tentis nocht far fra king
Edwardis army. Sindry prudent men war in the Douglas army, quhilkis per suadit
him be money reasonis to abstene fra battall. For king Edward had ane army full
of pepyl, daily exercit in cheuelry, and richt insolent eftir their frequent
victoryis with great munitionis and weirlie instrumentis, be co^trar the scottis
were brokin with the weris before past. Their agit and wise capitanis be sindry
discomfitouris slane. And ye people than present in his army oung and but any
experience of arms. And thairfore alliegit na thing sa good as to desist,
quhill they had sum practik or experience in arms. To this answerit ye
governor, that his folkis (howbeit yai were in few noumer to ennimes) laikit na
curage. And were all mouit with extreme hatrent aganis Inglismen for the cruelte
laitlie co^mittit aganis the sonnis of schir Alexander Seitoun. It was
thairfore not profitable to abide. For be la^g tarry yair Ire sall peris.
Forthir na exercition mycht eik their strenthis sa mekill as Ire rageand in
their breistis. Ye Douglas left this hailsum counsal, and co^mandit his army to
refresche yame self with meit and sleip and to be reddy to fecht aganis yair
ennymes on the morrow. At the brek of ye day he arrayit his folkis in yair best
manner. The wangard was geuin to Hew lord of Ros, hauand with him Ke^neth earl
of Suthirland, Simon and Iohne Fraseir, and John^ Murray lieutenand to ye earl
of Murray quhilk was yan trublit with great infirmite. The secound battall was
geuin to Alexander Lindesay with Alexand Gordon, Reginall Grahame and Robert
Kenneth. In the third battal was ye Douglas governor hauand with him James,
Iohne, and Allane sonnis of Walter great stewart of Scotland. On the tothir side
the Inglismen na thing affrayit of this ordinance come pertlie with displayit
baneris. And because they knew the ground (quhair the field was set be lang
residence at the sege forsaid) they feneit thaym to fle at their first Iunyng
to ane hill sum part stay. And throw the straitnes thairof it was rycht
contrarius to thaym that assaileit, and rycht commodius for thaym that stude at
defense thairof. Als sone as the Inglismen were cumyn to this hill, yai stintit
of their fleing, and be sound of trumpat went haistelie to their array. And
incontinent they set on the scottis quhilk were skatterit in ye vail following
so feirsly ye money of yame were miserabillie slane. The residew were sa astonist,
ye few of yame faucht saif only they that had mair respect to their honor
than to their lyuis or victory apperi^g. And yocht they slew great noumer of
Inglisme^ it yai were put to flicht. Finaly mair slauchter was maid in ye chase
than was before in ye battall, for ane wyng of Inglismen lay before and stopit
yair passage. Thus were they miserably slane on Ilk side. Na presoneris were
taken except ane few noumer, quhilkis were sauir only because their ennymes were
irkit with slaucht. In this lamentable battal were slane money of all the
nobillis and gentilmen of Scotland that eschapit before fra the battal of
Duplyne. And yai were estimit to ye noumer of.xiiii.M* me^. Their ar ye principal

commandit Patrik Dunbar to big the castle of du^bar upon his awin expensis,
because he kest it down before quhen he was disparit of releif. And co^mandit him
to keep it in times cumyng under his name. King Edward after this sorofull
victory of Scottis returnit in Ingland, and left behynd him money great noblis of
Ingland with Edward Ballioll to govern Scotland at their devise. The ballioll
went than throw all the boundis of Scotland, and garnist all the stren^his
thairof with Inglismen, except v. castellis allanerly quhylkis war in Scottis
mennis handis, that is to say. The castle of Dunbriton, quhylk was kepit be

castle of Kildru^my be Cristyne Bruce. The castle of Urquhart be Robert
Lauder. And ye peil of Low down be Iohne Thomeson. All their castellis stude at

Of the contention betuix Alexander Movvbray and Hary Bevvmont* and how
Inglismen perist at the sege of Lochleuvn. Ca. vi.
IN the samyn time Phillip king of France send his ambassatouris to the paip,
desyring him to interpone his auctorite, and constant ye Inglismen to desist
fra their cruel inuasioun maid on the scottis. The Inglismen held the papis
ambassatouris in sic contemption that they wald nocht suffer thaym to cum in
their presence. Throw quhilk they were constranit to depart but any expeditioun
of their materis. Sone after ane conuentioun was maid be Edward Ballioll at
Perth, quhare the nobyllis of Scotland ratifyit him king, and promyttit be
their aithis neuir to rebel aganis him in times cumyng. In the mean time raise
ane scharp contentioun betuix Hary Bewmont and Alexander Mowbray for certane
lands i^ Buchquha^. Hary Bewmont clamit their landis to pertene to him. For he
maryit the said Alexanderis douchter quhylk was heritoure (as he allegit) to
the said landis. On ye tothir side Alexander Mowbray clamit their landis be
reasoun of succession, as air to his brothir. After lang contentioun the said
Alexander Mowbray gat the landis adiugit to him be sentence of the Ballioll.
David Cumyn e^le of Atholl and Richard Talbot allieging this sentence wrangusly
geuyn aganis Hary Bewmont, maid ane conspiratioun aganis the Ballioll. And
stuffit the castle of Dongard in Buchquhane with money other housis of Scotland
aganis his auctorite. The Ballioll seeing great trubyll apperyng to him be this
way, retretit the sentence that he gaif for Alexander Mowbray, and be new
sentence adiugit the landis to pertene to the said Hary Bewmont, because he
maryit the herytoure thairof. The parteis that clamit their landis war sa great,
that the just verite of their debait couth neuir be decidit be sicht of
Justice. Thus was ye Ballioll constranit to have ay the ta party his ennyme,
quhen the tothir become his friend. Nocht lang after the Ballioll come to
Ramfrew, and ressauit all the pepyll and strenthis thairof to his opinioun.
Than was brocht to him the keyis of the castellis of Rothesay and Dunnone be
schir Allane Lyle Sereif of Bute. Yus grew the Balliol daily in mair pissance
be co^fluence of pepil. For he enrichit thaym with landis and gudis that
assistit to him. Robert Stewart heirand the Balliol set ylk day for his
slauchter, come out of Bute to the castle of Dunbritane* quhare he was
plesandly ressauit be Malcolme Flemyng keipar thairof. In the mean time the
Ballyoll rasit ane army to take all the strenthis of Scotland, because they war
occasioun of battall aganis him. In the nixt eir he laid ane sege to the
castle of Lochleuyn. And quhen he had considerit that this castle mycht nocht
be taken but lang sege, he left schir Iohne Stryuelyng to ly at the sege thairof
with ane great power, quhyll the castle war won. And to do their besines mair
esaly, they maid their bastaileis and trinscheis of Fale and Deuat in the
kirkard of sanct Sarfe beside Kinrosse. This castle was kepit be Alane Uepount
and James Lamby cietezanis of sanct Andros. At last quhen their Inglismen had
assaileit lang time to get this castle. After money great assaltis with syndry
ingynis, howbeit they war in vane, they deuysit be ane subtell slycht to take
the castle but any straik. First they inclusit the watter that ran out of the
Loch with ane hye dyke, and biggir it sa strait with fale Deuat and treis, that
the wat^er of Leuyn should have na passage, bot inclusit perforce quhyll it war
rysyn above the castle, and all the pepyll in it perist. And to cause the dam
to boldyn mair haistely, they brocht burnis fra syndry partis to the said loch.
Schir Iohne Stryuelyng capitane of the sege, seand al thingis (as he beleuit)
done in dew manner (for na thing mycht auale bot process of time to win the house)
went to Dunfermelyng to his devotion (because it was sanct Margretis day ye haly
queen of scotland) and left behynd him sa money as he thocht sufficient to keep
the sege. Alane Uepount capitane foresaid knawyng ye great dangeir apperyng to
him, send.iiii. men out of the castle within ye nicht in ane bait with speris
and wappynnis to break ye dyke foresaid. And quhen they had laubourit all nycht
borand the dike fore said, they tuke purpos (because yai^ lauboure semit vane)
to return to the castle but any expeditioun. Nochtheles ane of thaym exhortit
ye laif to continue forth ane hour to se quhat fine mycht cum of their
lauboure. Als sone as they persauit ane hole maid throw the dyke, they returnit
to the castle. Incontinent the streme followit sa fast quhare the watter gat
passage* that it brake down the bastaileis, and nocht only drownit the pepyll
that lay under ye dam, bot brocht thaym with horse carriage and al yair provision
to ye see. Alane Uepount (quhen the watter was fallin to ye auld mesoure)
yschit out of the castle, and slew ane part of thaym that war eschapit at this
time, and the remanent put to flycht. Iohne Striuelyng herand sic calamyte
falling to his folkis returnit to the sege, and maid ane vow neuir to depart
thairfra quhyll it war taikyn, And every person found in it slane. At last
quhen he had lyin lang at the sege thairof, and seeing the castle nocht abyl to
be takin, he was constranit to leif the sege with great slauchter of his folkis.

Ingland with ye Ballioll, and left David Cumyn earl of Athole to be gouernoure
to take the remanent strenthis of Scotland, and to hald the pepyll at his
opinioun. Earl David be insolence of yis new auctoryte tuke possessioun of all
the landis of Murray and Buchquhan quhilkis pertenit to Robert stewart. And
nocht only gat the inhabitantis thairof sworn to his opinioun, bot confiscat
all the guddis of yame that war found contrarius thairto. Robert Stewart
incontinent assemblit his freindis, and be auise of Dongall Campbell of
Lochquhow tuke the castle of Dunnone and slew all personi^ found in it. The

Murray heirand great iniuris done be earl David of Athole went to Aberdene. Earl
David seeing the pepyll gaderit ilk day with new power to recover yair leberte
fled to the montanis and desertis, quhare he was brocht to great misere and
constranit lang time to sustene his life on rutis and herbis. At last quhen he
saw na way to eschew, he come in lamentabyll weid petuusly desyring grace. The
nobillis of scotland ressauit him to their favor. For he was ane man of nobyll
blude of great manrent and landis, and gart him sweir to be as true to king
David, as he was before to king Edward. At this time schir Wyllyam Douglas of
Liddisdale and Andro Murray war redemit with great ranson after yt they war
haldin three eris presoneris in Ingland. At their cumyng to Edinburgh was ane
conuentioun of the lordis. The earl of Murray and Robert stewart with general

was brocht to great trubyll, sum of thaym perist, and otheris brokin on craggis.
The residew of their navy knawyng that they incurrit ye hatrent of god and
sanct Colme for their sacralege, returnit to the said abbay, and maid great
offerandis in recompense of their offense, and returnit hame but disples^ir. At
this time the duke of Gilder come with great power throw Ingland in support of
king Edward, and was discomfist on the burrow mure beside Edinburgh, and chasit
to the cas^el thairof, quhilk was that time in Inglismennis handis. At last he
was constranit be lang sege to cum in will, his guddis tynt and his life only
to be sauit. The earl of Murray randerit to him curtesly all his guddis and
sufferit him to depart, After that he was sworn neuir to assist to Inglismen.
Amang the spuleis of yis battal was found ane woman of meruellus stature,
quhylk preuit great vassalage in this battall, and slew money vaileant men with
her awin handis. Forthir (because these duk of Gilder was friend to Philip king
of France) he was conuoyit be the earl of Murray to ye bordouris. In the mean
time ane buschement of Inglisme^ and scottis lay in wait, and randerit him in

returnit in Ingland and tuke the Balliol with him. for he beleuit als sone as
he had conquest Scotland, that the Ballioll should rebel aganis him on the samyn
manner as Iohne Ballyol his fader did before. Earl David richt insolent after
this auctorite began to exerce new tyranny on all the scottis that war
repugnant to king Edward. Sum of thaym spuleit of yair landis and guddis,
otheris put to deith. The nobyllis hauand great indignation that this earl of
Athole should exerce sic tyranny on their pepil (consideri^g he was saiffit only
in ye eir before be their co^miseratioun) come with great power aganis him. David
Cumyn herand the lordis gaderit thus aganis him, left the sege of Kyldrummy,

nobyllis, and Andro Murray maid gouernoure in the place of the earl of Murray,
quhilk was taken unhappily (as said is) with Inglismen. This Andro after that he
had live lang time at ye sege of Cowpar, was aduertist that ye Cumynis maid

necessar to support ye cuntre, than to sege any castellis. The Cumynis knawyng
his cumyng met him with set battall, bot they war vincust. In this battall was
slane Robert Cumyn, Wyllyam Cumyn, and Thomas Calder, vaileant knychtis,
Howbeit they war ennimes to king David for ye time. This victory gottin (as
said is) be Andro Murray, brocht all the north of Scotland under good obeisance
to king David. Few Inglismen abaid after this victory in Scotland except sa
money as war within the castle of Dongard. At last the said castle was taken
and na man left leuand in it except Hary Bewmont capitane, Quhylk was sworn to
depart in Ingland but any returning. Sic thingis done, the governor laid ane
sege to the castle of Lochindoris, quhare elre David Cumynis wife was for ye

he brint the town of Aberdene. His navy (quhilk was arriuit in Forth) began on
the same manner (as the to their did before) to spule the abbay of sanct Colme.
And on the samyn manner yair sacr^lege was nocht lang vnpunist. For ^ne of the
schyppis that was ladyn with sanct Colmes guddis sank but any tempest to the sea ground. King Edward at his returnyng to Perth (because it was cassyn down

aganis this Heltane his brothir (because he brint ye kirk of sa^ct Bute with ane
thousand personis in it) yt he dang him throw the body with ane swerd before the
alter of Sanct Iohne, and said. This haly place sal be na mair refuge to the,
than other housis of god hes been before fra thy tyranny, quhen thou distroyit
sa money innocent pepyll but sicht to rycht or wrang. Sic thyngis done king
Edward returnit in Ingland, and left behind him the Ballioll with ane great
power at Perth. At this time Hary Bewmont slew all Scottis quhome he mycht
apprehend specially thaym that war at the slauchter of his cousin David Cumin.
Als sone as Andro Murray was aduertist of king Edwardis departing, he come fra

forthwart with the residew of his folkis. In ye mean time the bordorares with
sindry garnisonis of the cuntre come aufull^e aganis him. Sone eft he maid him
be craft of cheualry to flee, quhill at last his ennymes followit to ye same
place, quhare his buschementis were lyand under wait. Incontinent the
buscheme^tis raise and inuadit yame ^u^ilk side, and finalie disco^fist yam with
great slauchter. Amang sindry other presoneris quhilkis were taken at this time
the e^le of Salisbery and the capitane of Roxburgh were taken. The earl was
interchangit for ye earl (...) Murray, quhilk was haldin money eris before
presonere in Ingland. This Alexander Ramsay seand the capitane of Roxburgh with
money of all the sodiouris thairof taken at this Iurnay, come haistely with
ledderes to Roxburgh, and enterit perforce ouir the wallis. King David for his
vassalage gaif both ye capitanry of Roxburgh and screifschip of Teuidale to
the said Alexander. And for that cause* he come in great hatrent to William
Douglas, and was finalie taken be him in the kirk of Hawik, And was haldin in
captivity in the castle of Hermetage quhyll he deceissit. King David rycht
co^mouit yat yis nobill man Alexander was put down on this manner, Thocht (gyf
sic attemptatis were vnpunist) they mycht be occasioun to conspire aganis him in
sum hi^ar materis, and so he gart search yis William Douglas to be punist to
the deith. Nochtheles the said William drew him fra the kyngis presence, and
abaid in the montanis and other desertis of Scotland, quhill Robert Stewart and
other nobillis finaly recounsalit him to the kyngis favor, and gat him
restorit both to his honor and landis of Teuydale as he was before.

How king David revvardit the airi^ of thaym that war slane at Duplyne and
Halidon hill. And how he inuadit Ingland syndry times with great iniuris. Ca.
xii.
SCotland beand pecifiit on this manner, and Inglismen eieckit out of all partis
thairof, King David set ane counsall a^ Perth, and commandit al thaym yat did
any honest vassalage for defense of the realm, or had their faderis slane at
the battalles of Dupline and Halydon, to be geuyn to him in byl, that he mycht
considder their honest ieoperdes, and reward yame effering to their meritis. At
last quhen they war all conuenit, he beand perticularly aduertist of every
dedis done be thaym self and yair faderis, he rewardit thaym richely with gold,
seluer, and Iowellis, that they mycht have als mekyll pleseit for the time
present, as they had sorrow for the time bygane. Nane was that couth schaw any
of his freindis or kynnismen slane or did any vaileant deides with his awin
handis bot was rewardit with gudly recompense. Amang syndry other that war
rewardit at this time, Hew Boece grand schir to master Hector Boece compilar
of their Croniklis, gat in recompense of his faderes slauchter at Duplyne the
heritoure and lady of the barony of Balbrid geuyn to him in marriage. Quhilk
barony is it possedit be the airis of the said Hew. Quhen king David had
rewardit the noblis of his realm on yis wise he thocht na thing sa good as to
revenge ye iniuris done sa money eris before be Inglismen. it sindry prudent men
gaif him counsall to delay his weris, quhill his pepill were conualescit both
in their bodyis and guddis. For they were waistit be lang weris before enduring.
Attour ye season was yan to manure yair landis, that they mycht releif the
pepill of great derth quhilk yai presently sustenit. To their wordis answerit
king David, he wald assail ye chance of fortoun, to bring his pepil i^ great
riches be spule of Inglismen, and to revenge the iniuris done be thaym sa money
eris before. Sone eftir all fensabill men were co^mandit to be reddy agane ane
certane day. Nocht lang eftir he maid the earl of Murray lieutenand to his
army, and enterit in Northumbirla^d quhare he remanit ane month* inuading ye
cuntre with fire and swerd, Syne returnit in scotland with great riches. Sone
eftir his returnyng he rasit ane new power of scotland and enterit agane in
Ingland. Ye Inglismen seeing yame self nocht of pissance to resist his army,
gaderit all yair guddis to strenthis. In the mean time.v. knychtis of scotland
namit, Stewart, Eglintoun, Cragy, Boyd and Fullartoun persewing Inglismen ouir
feirslie, were taikin and redemit eftir with great ranson. King David seeing him
self Ilk day waisting his time, and na apperance of battall, returnit in
scotland. Not lang eft he went agane in England, and was trublit with so
vehement wei^ and haill, yt he mycht skarslie debait him self and his army
vnperist be storm of wedder. On the tothir side ye Inglismen were gaderit
aganis him ouirset with tempest on the samyn manner* King David (that his purpos
should nocht be in vane (kest down sindry strange housis on ye bordouris of
Ingland. And returnit in Scotland but any other trubyll to his army.

How king David at the request of France inuadit Ingland with great
displeseiris. And how he was taikin at Durame. How Inglismen conquest great
boundis in Scotland. Ca. xiii.
King Phillip of france was cruelly inuadit during this time be king Edward of
Ingland. And send his oratouris in Scotland desiring king David to inuaid
Ingland with battall. To that fine yat king Edward to resist ye iniure of
scottis should leif ye sege of Caleis. In the mean time come ambassatouris fra
king Edward in Scotland to treit peace with king David and promittit to rander
both Berwik and the Ballioll in Scottis mennis handis. For he was (as they
alliegit) the great occasioun of iniuris so la^g continewing betuix Inglis and
Scottis. The lordis to answer to yir materis went to their counsall. Bot yai
were deuidit in sindry opinionis Ilk man eftir his fantasy. Su^ be rage of outh
and auld hatrent aganis Inglismen were desirus of battall. Otheris irkit with
lang weris desirit peace. And thocht their offeris of Ingland nocht to be
contempnyt, sen money co^moditeis mycht follow thairthrow. Alwayis it was demit,
gyf sic honest offeris were contempnit, more truble than proffet should follow.
Apperit that perpetual amyte and kyndnes sall continue betuix Inglismen and
Scottis, gif he were taken away, that was the mouar of their weris. To this
answerit king David and otheris, that were of the opinioun of France. The
memory of infinite pleseiris done to ws be king Phillip mouis ws to schaw sum
kyndnes to him. For he nocht only ressauit ws quhen may dangeir occurrit,
bot defendit ws fra all ennymes, quhen we were exilit of our realm. Forthir the
band before contrackit betuix king Robert our fader and France mouis ws to
assist to the opinion of France. Thairfore gyf we be nobill men, hauand sycht
to thaym that hes auancit our common weill and liberte, no thing was so good as
to revenge auld iniuris do^e be ennymes. Thus was it con^^^^it to have battall
with Ingland (...) solicitatioun of king David. For he desirit to do su^ honest
vassalage that he mycht thairthrow be comparit to the glore of his eldaris. The
ambassatouris of Ingland were depeschit on this wise but any expeditioun of
their desiris. And the ambassatouris of France fullelie satifyit. Sone eftir be
opin proclamatioun all fensabill men within this realm were co^mandit to meit
ye king at ane certane day and place. In the mean time the earl of Ros come
with money folkis to Perth, and maid his mowster to the king. And in the nycht
following he slew the lord of the Ilis with.vii. of his kynnismen slepand in
their beddis, and returnit incontine^t to Ros. King David (nochtwithstandyng
the great displeseir that he tuke for the said slauchter) rycht desirus to have
punist the same, supersedit the punitioun thairof, quhill time occurrit more
ganand. At his cu^ing to ye bordouris he maid money knychtis to steir thaym to
knychtlie vassalage. He maid William douglas earl. This William was son to
Archebald Douglas slane before at H^lidon hill. Sic thingis done king David
distroyit the may part of all Northumbirland with fire and swerd. It is said,
king David was monist be visioun in his sleip, to abstene fra all landis
pertenand to sanct Cuthbart. Othirwayis hes weris should haif ane miserable end.
Als sone as he was awalkinnit, he thocht sic visio^is bot fantaseis. And
co^mandit his army (nochtwithstanding sic visioun) to spare na la^dis nor
townis quhair they come. At last they come to Durame, quhare sanct Cuthbart is
patron, and spuleit both the abbay and all placis yairabout. King Edward
impacient to suffir their iniuris, send the earl of Northumbirland out of France
with great power. This earl before his cumyng send ane herald to king David
desiring him to return in Scotland, and to put end to his weris. Otherwayis he
should haif ba^tall on the third day eftir. King David tuke litil respect to yis
message. Bot co^ma^di^ his folkis to be reddy to resist their ennymes. On the
morrow he deuidit his army in three battallis. In ye first wyng was Robert
Stewart prince of Scotland and Patrik earl of March. In the secund wyng was
Iohne earl of Murray, And William earl of Douglas In ye myd battall was king
David with all ye remanent nobillis of scotland. This earl of Douglas (because
he was wardane of the bordouris) departit fra the scottis to espy the army of
Ingland, and so vnwarlie quhair their army lay, ye.v.C. of his folks were
slane, and him self narowly eschaping with his life. At last quh^ both ye
armyis were in otheris sicht, David Grahame come with five hundredth bodin men on
ye skyrtis of Inglis archearis to have brokin thaym. Nochtheles he was so
inuadit with arrowis, that money of his folkis war slane, and him self narowly
eschaping. The Scottis nochtwithstandyng both their discomfitouris, ruschit
feirsly on their ennymes, and faucht lang time with great manheid to the deith.
At last Robert Stewart and the Earl of March seeing their folkis defaik curage
(after they had fochtyn lang time with doutsum victory) fled out of the field.
This fleing of the earl of March and Robert Stewart was ane great displeseir to
all the army of Scottis. For the same battall that faucht aganis thaym come sa
awfully on the battall quhare king David faucht, that it was fynaly vincust,
and put to flycht. Than was king David left with ane small cu^pany in the
field. Howbeit he left na thing undone, that mycht pertene to the deuore of ane
forcy campioun. Sum time persuadyng his folkis to return with new battall, And
su^ time ruschit with ane buschement of vaileant me^, quhare he saw may
confluence and preis of Inglismen, with purpos to have put thaym abak, that the
resydew of his folkis mycht have ^ane new curage to return in battall.
Nochthelis their abaid nane with him ^ot sa money as had mair respect to their
honor than l^^e, fechtand with perseuerand manhe^^ to the deith. And youcht
king David was destitute but any h^lp. it he ceissit nocht to persevere in
obstinat battall, quhyll he was ouirset with multitude of pepyll, and two
speris hyngand in his body. And youcht he mycht nothir fle nor it break the
said speris. it he wald nocht suffer him to be taken, thynkand na thing sa
odious as to remane on life after sa great slauchter maid on his nobillis, and
ceissit nocht to provoke his ennymes with may dispitfull wourdis to sla him.
The Inglismen seeing that he mycht nocht eschape set their besynes to take him.
Than Iohne Copland desyrit him to be oldyn* for both his swerd and wappinuis
war dong out of his handis. Nochtheles he tuke this Copland with sic violent
dynt on the chaftis, that he dang out two of his forthir teith. Na better
chance was in the left wyng, quhare the erlis of Murray and Douglas faucht. For
that battall was vincust. The earl of Murray slane, and the earl of Douglas
taken. In this sorrowful battall war slane the earl of Murray. The earl of
Stratherne, The Constabyll. The Marcheall. The chalmerlane and Chancellar of
Scotland with great nowmer of money other nobyllis and commonis. The king was
taken with.v* erllis, that is to say. Douglas, Fife, Suthirland, Wygtoun, and
Menteith. Ane arrowheid was schot in king Dauidis leg, with sic violence* that

was spuleit of it and of al other Iowellis found on him for the time. Yis
battall was strikin at Durame the.xvii. day of October fra our

prince of Walis and son to king Edward Windisore come with ane army in france*
and inuadit the cuntre sa cruelly, that syndry boundis thairof apperit (gif he

the dalphyne of France fled with great buschementis. throw quhilk king John^ was
left desolat in the field with his oungest son Phillip, quhilk was namit
after Phillip hardy, because his swerd was found drawin in his ha^dis. Thus was
king Iohne taken and brocht presonere in Ingland. Ye ^rle of Douglas was
rescorsit be hes freindis out of this field. Bot Archebald Douglas son to schir
James of Douglas yt was slane in Spane was taken, bot he was redemit with small

harnes in ye same manner as he faucht, schir Wyllyam Ramsay of Colluthy tuk him
on ye chaftis with his neif, and said. Tratoure thou art ye deith of thy
master the earl of Douglas. For thou clothit the in the same armor yat should
have debatit him. Incontinent he causit him to draw of his butis, and held him
in sic vile laubour, that he was redemit with small ransoun. It is said yt king
Edward full of vane arroga^ce sat crownit with septour and diadem betuix two
captive kyngis of Scotland and France in his feist of ule, that sic thingis
mycht be rehersit to his glore, takand na respect to the vnsickir stait of man,
as na sic aduersite micht fall to him. King David within certane eres after was

And yt this money should be payit the mair surely, trewis war taken for.xiiii.
eris. Money of all the lordis and baronis of scotland war laid in plege at
London for payment of ye said ransoun. King David was obelist eftir his
returnyng in Scotland to cast down the castellis of Mortoun, Dalswyntoun,
Dunfreis, and Durisdere, because they war noysum to Inglismen. After his
returnyng in Scotland he set ane parliament, and maid great punitioun on thaym
that fled fra him at Durame. And first he brake the tail that was maid to his
cousyn Robert Stewart of ye croun of scotland. For he was ane great occasion of
the discomfitoure at Durame be his fleing. And thairfore he transferrit the
said tail in Iohne Suthirland quhilk was gottin on Jane his oungest sister.
And causi^ all the lordis to be sworn to keep ye said tail. The earl a^
Suthirland traisting his son Iohne to succeed to the crown, dealt the may part
of his landis amang his freindis, quhilkis war Hayis, Sinclaris, Ogilbyis, and
Gordonis. Nochtheles ye said earl was frustrat both of his landis and the
crown of Scotland. For his son John^ was geuyn ama^g ye remanent plegis for
king Dauides ransoun and deceissit at London. After the deith of the earl of
Suthirlandis son, Robert Stewart was recounsalit to king David and maid
heritour to the croun under ye same tail as he was before. Money other great
baronis war punist on ye same wife for their fleing at Durame. Ye kirk of
scotland gaif the.x. penny of all yai^ frutis to king David to help ye pament
of his ranson. At yis time the realm of France was in great displeseir. For
king Iohne was haldin in captivity. Quhill at last he left both his sonnis in
pledge for him and come to paris, quhair he pieteuslie regratit his captivity,
and said. It was ane great los to him, that he had nocht sic nobil men in his
dayis as Roland and Gawyne to laubour for his redemptioun, as was in king
Charlis time before him. Inco^tine^t stude up ane nobil man of great manheid and
wisdom, ennyme to ye kyngis sleuth. And said. Mycht we find sic ane prince as
charlis, we should find Rolland and Gawyne and other duche peris ynew. Their
wordis were deparprentit in king Iohnis mind, than any man beleuit. Because hes
febilnes and sleuth was so opinlie reprochit* Nocht lang eftir he returnit in
Ingland to visie his sonnis and deceissit at Londoun.

NOcht la^g eftir king David callit his lordis and baronis to ane counsall. For
in the time of his captivity at London, he ^romittit to transfer ye croun of
scotland in king Edwardis son, gyf the lordis of scotland wald consent
thairto. The lordis (quhen this matter was proponit before thaym) answerit. They
wald neuir consent yairto, sa lang as any of thaym mycht beir wappinnis or

quhilk was fra our redemption ane M.iii.C.lvii. Lady Jane spous to king David

eftir he repentit, and was so sorrowful* yt he had degradit his blud ryal with
sic obscure lynnage, yat he ^anist her and all otheris that gave him counsall

scho gat finalie ane sentence aganis king David to annere to her as his
lawchful lady and wyffe. Thus should ye realm have cumyn under interdiction and

eftir money other poleseis, reparit all ye strenthis of his realm, and biggit
ane toure in ye castle of Edinburgh, quhilk was eft callit Dauides toure.
Finalie quhen he had brocht his realm to great tra^quillite he tuk purpos to

Douglas lord of Galloway rycht impacient to sustene ye iniuris daily done in
Galloway and Annandale be Inglismen of Lochmaben, come with ane great power be

At last quhen he was cumyn within ane mile to ye said castle, he was taken be

heirand yir syndry iniuris done be scottis, send his eme the duk of Longcastell
with great armyis in scotland both be see and land. And eftir yat he had dantit

yair in ye time of his exile, he returnit in Ingland but any ferder inuasioun.
Nochtheles his navy abaid still in Forth and heryit and brint yt see coistis on

This was the last vassalage done be ye said earl William, ane of the may
vaileant men that was in his dayis. He deceissit sone eftir in ye hait feuour
in ye castle of Douglas and lyis in Melros. Eftir his deith succedit his son

And because ye scottis refusit to win ye house in ye sort, ye army skalit. And at
ye Hal^omes nixt following the Admiral departit in France with ye residew of

How king Richard inuadit scotland with great cruelteis, and of great vassalage
done be VVyllyam Douglas. Ca. v.
After ye departing of fra^chemen, the scottis come with ane army in England
and remanit two monethis. Syne returnit with great pray of men and guddis in
scotland. King Richard after his returnyng out of France to revenge their
iniuris done be scottis, come with great ordinance throw the Mers and Louthiane,
putting both la^dis, townis, and kirkis (quhare he come) to vt euersion. he
brint melros, driburgh, newbotil, and slew al ye religius me^ yairof. als he
bri^t Edinburgh and ye kirk of sa^ct geil, bot ye abbay was sauit be ye duk of
lo^gcastel. for he was lugit i^ it before. Sic thi^gis done king Richard
returnit in Ingland but any damage done to him be scottis. In ye nixt eir
quhilk was fra our redemption i.M.iii.C.lxxxvii. deceissit byschop Walter
Warldlaw of Glasgew cardinal. Not lang after the returning of king Richard in
Ingland, ye duk of Albany come with ane army of.xxx.M. men in Ingland. In his
army was James earl of Douglas, and Archebald douglas lord of Galloway. This
army come sa warly throw the watter of Sulway, yat they come to Cokirmouth in
Ingland, and abaid their three days inuading the cuntre with great cruelteis, and
returnit with great pray of guddis in scotland. Amang syndry spuleis gottin at
this iornay was found ane charter of certane landis geuyn be ye king of Ingland
under their wordis. I king Athelstane geuis to Paulane oddam Roddam als good and
als fair, as euir they mine war. And yairto witness Mald my wife, quhilk charter
is nocht unlike to ane charter geuin be king Wyllyam in manner as followis. Heir
I Wyllyam king, the third eir of my ring, geuis to ye Normand huntere, to me
thou art both leif and dear, the hop and the hoptoun, and all the boundis up

to ye and to thine. Als fre as the kingrik is mine. To verify yt yis is says.
I bite ye quhit walx with my tuith, before Meg, Mald, Mariory, and my eldest son.
For ane bow and ane braid arrow, quhen I cum to hunt upon arrow. Be their
charteris apperis mair faith was geuin to wordis of kingis, princis, and other
pepyll in they dayis, than ar geuyn now. For the ingyne of man sekis sa many
slichtis and new inuentionis, that na wordis can be found sufficient to strenth
sic donationis and charteris geuyn in our days. In this last iornay aganis
Inglismen Wyllyam son to Archebald douglas lord of galloway wan great fame and
honor. For above money other his vaileant dedis, he brint ye suberbyllis of
Carlele, hauand bot two seruandis in his cumpany and maid sa meruellus
slauchter on the sodiouris thairof, that he kest sindry of thaym ouir the brig,
and otheris slew quhilkis kepit the said brig. After this quhen the said town

with his neif, and ye remanent two chasit. Throw quhilk he rescoursit him self
fra his ennymes. King Robert for these may honorabil vassalage gaif to ye said
William his doucht Gelis in marriage, quhilk excellit all other women in bewte.
It is said ye king of france was sa inamorit with yis virgin, yt he co^mandit

How Robert Stevvart and VVyllya^ Douglas did great vassalage in Ireland, how
James earl of douglas vincust Hary Perse in syngular battall. and how he ^egit
the new castle. Ca. vi.
IN the eir following quhilk was fra our redemption.i.M.iii.C.lxxxviii Robert
earl of Fiffe and archebald lord of Galloway entrit with ane proud army in
Ingland. And in the same time come syndry Ireland men with great buschementtis
in Galloway, and tuke great prayis out of the samyn. Robert Stewart (...)
Douglas son to Archebald (...) of Galloway till revenge their (...) went with
ane army in (...) and segit ane strange town (...) Carlingfurd. The cietezanis
(...) na pyssance to resist (...) trewis for certane sowmes (...). And in the

brint it in powder. Syne ^uk.xv. schippis, quhilkis war lyand in the raid and
chargit thaym with the guddis of this town. And in their returnyng hame they
spuleit the I Will of man. Nocht lang after their returnyng in Scotland, king
Rychard send ane army in scotland. This army enterit in ye Mers, and kest down
money great touris and strenthis thairof. King Robert than conuenit all his
nobyllis at Aberdene, In the quhilk was concludit to raise the power of ye
realm with all deligence to revenge their iniuris done be Inglismen. Not lang
after.ii. armyis war rasit. The first was geuin in governance to Robert Stewart
earl of Fiffe, hauand with him ye earl of Menteith, Archebald Douglas lord of
Galloway, and Alexand Lindesay of Walcop to ye nowmer of.xv.M. me^ to pas in
Cu^^bir. The tothir army was geuyn to James earl of Douglas, and George earl of
March, hauand with thaym James Lindesay earl of Crawfurd. John^ Dunbar earl of
Murray, and Hay constabyll of scotland with siclyk nowmer as before to invade
Northumberland. Their armyis wrocht sic cruelteis, yat nocht was hard bot
spraichis and ru^missing of deand pepyll in all partis quhare they come with
may terribyll flambis bryngand great townis and bigingis to vter rewyne. At
last both yir armyis met togidder at the new castle, after yat they had past
with swerd and fire throw al boundis of Northumbirland and Cumber. In the mean
time the earl of Douglas chesit.x.M. vaileant men to sege ye new castle, quhilk
sta^dis upon ye watter of Tyne. and began to search delige^tly be quhat manner
he mycht may esaly invade the said town, quhilk was than full of pepyll. For
the may part of all the chosyn men of Northumberland to ork war in ye said
town with schir Hary Perse secound son to ye earl of Northu^birland callit for
his ythand priking Hary Haitspure. This Hary confiding in his syngulare manheid
and lang use of arms, come forth of the new castle desyryng to fecht with the
earl of Douglas in syngular batttall. The Douglas na thing refusing his
desyris, glaidly condiscendit to fecht i^ quhat sort he plesit. Fynaly their two
feits campionis montit on their ba^dit coursouris, and ran aufully togidder
with square and ground speris to the deith. The Douglas wise and circumspect in
all his doingis, nocht only sauit him self fra displeseir of ennymes, bot be
his strenth and singular ma^heid dang the Perse out of ye sadyl. The Inglismen
(quhilk stude before the portis abiding the chance of fortoun) suddanly
rescoursit the Perse, and brocht him to yair town. Thus succedit na les honor
to the Douglas than dishonor to the Perse. Sic thingis done the Douglas
callit all his capitanis before him to schaw thaym in quhat part the town micht
be may esaly takyn. Incontinent all his army come pertly with ledderis to the
wallis, and fillit ye fowseis with great multitude of hay and treis. Nochtheles
the town was sa vaileantly defendit, that he was co^stranit to depart fra ye
sege with great slauchter of his folkis and sone after he tuke his viage to
return in Scotland.

How the Inglismen war discomfist at Ottirburn* the earl of Doug a^ slane.
and the Perse brocht presoner in scotland. How the Hepburnis tuke their
beginning. Ca. vii.
HOw was earl James of Douglas cumyn to the town of Ottirburn i^ Riddisdale to
have returnit in scotland, quhen suddanly come to him ane bord^rar on ane swift
gelding, and schew how the Inglismen war cumand on him with arrayit battallis.
Thus war y^ scottis gr^u^ly effrayit. Nochtheles ye Douglas exhortit thaym to
remember their frequent victoryis, be quhilkis yai vincust sa often before their
ennymes, And prayit thaym to feir nocht the multitude of their f^is* for it was
na difficulte to vincus thaim, quhilkis hes been sa oftymes before be thaym
discomfist. Attour their ennymes war na ma at yat time than they war before at
Ba^nokburn, quhare.xxx.M. discomfist.iii.C.M. And fynaly he desirit yam to have
good sicht to yair manheid and vassalage prouyn with sa great felicite in the
eris before past, yat they may conques sum new and recent victory quhilk should be
mair apprisit than any auld glore of other victoryis past before. And because he
knew all the folkis in his cumpany, and was exercit with yame mekyll of his
dayis, he exhortit every ane of yame be him self, to schaw their ma^heid and
virtew with sum notabyll vassalage on their ennymes. On ye tothir side Ha^y
haitspur capitane of Inglisme^ exhortit hes folks to fe^ht for defense of yair
cuntre, and their pare^tis, children, wiffis, and ^^^dids, and schew how they
war of sic pissance, that they mycht distro^ th^i^ ennimes at yair pleseir. And
because victory was sicker in their handis and their ennymes perturbat, best was
to pas forthwart with sic curage that their ennymes may be vincust at yair
first iunyng. Incontinent be sound of trumpat both ye armyis iunit in may
fury, and faucht lang with vncertane victory, quhil at last yai war seuerit fra
other be cumyng of the nycht. Nochtheles they abaid the risyng of ye moan to
^echt agane with new battall. Als sone thai^fore as the moon was risyn, they
iunit agane with mair hatrent than before. And quhen the fore bro^t of the
scottis war slane, the Inglismen began to put ye scottis abak. And but dout
they had won the anseneis of the Douglas and put hes army to flicht, war not
Patrik Hepburn with his son and freindis come the mair haistely to support of
scottis. Be quhome the battallis war renewit. Quhyll ye armyis war fechtand i^
sic cruelte. The Douglas come with ane heavy mace of mair wecht and quantite,
than any man micht weild in they dayis, and tuschit amang the great preis of his
ennimes quhare he maid sic terribil slauchter, that they war finaly put to
flicht. The chase continewit with great slauchter on Inglisme^, quhil the brek

thryis strikin throw the body and ane deidis wound in his heid, quhilk was
geuin to him be Inglismen, after that his hewmond was not bound weil to his

murnyng. Than the Douglas with sic curage as he mycht said to thaym in their
wordis. My hartly freindis avoid all this lament and dolor out of our
breistis, and reiose of ye present victory quhilk is grantit to ow be special
favor of god. We have ieoperd our lyuis this day for ye honor yat is
succedit now to ws. Yairfore turn our teres and dolor in ympnis and orisonis

succedit to scottis with great murdir of Inglismen. it nane was in that army bot
wald have been content to have changit his life for the Douglas. This earl of
Douglas was brocht eft his deith to Melros, and buryit beside his fader earl

Howbeit sic thingis had been vncertane to ws before. For youcht thou semit as

Of ye great lamentation maid be king Robert the third for the taking of his
son. And of his deith. Ca. xvi.
QUhen their letteris war red be king Hary, he callit his lordis to ane
counsall, to auyse quhat was to be done in this matter. Sum of yame irkit with
lang weris, and mouit of commiseration for the aduersite falling to king
Robert, said. Best was to obtemper his desires, for his son was cu^ of his
benevolence to seek refuge aganis ennymes. Otheris war far discrepant fra ye
purpos. Sayng James was takin i^ time of weir, and his fader king Robert not
only inuadyng Inglismen with co^tinewal weris, bot ressetting yair ennymes in
his realm. and alliegit ye syndry scotts come in support of Hary haitspure
and other conspiratouris at ye last battal of Schrewisbery. Thus was it
concludit to keep the said James as lauchfull presoner. it be benevolence of
king Hary war chosin sa wise and expert preceptouris to instruk him in virtew
and science, yt he was na les resolute i^ every science, than he had been
perpetually occupyit bot in ane. For he was weil lernit to fecht with the
swerd, to just, to turnay, to worsyll, to sing and dance, and was ane expert
medicinar, richt crafty in playing both of lute and harp. and sindry other
instrumentis of musik. He was expert in gramer, oratry, and poetry, and maid sa
flowand and sententious versis, yat apperit weil he was ane natural and borne
poet. He was als ane cunnyng Theolog. For he lernit all his science during ye
time of his captivity, and was ha^dyn all ye said time in great admiration to
the pepyl for his singular virtew. Thus succedit his captivity to hes great
proffet and honor. King Robert herand how his son was taken on yis manner be
Inglismen maid ane heavy lamentation and said. Had I maryit as other anciant
kingis my progenitouris of scotland did before with nobyl princis and kingis of
honest nationis. I had not been lichtlit and contempnit (as I am now) with my
liegis. For my eldest son is slane and ye tothir chasit of ye cuatre, and for
falt of freindis taken with ennymes. Yis may be exampyl to al kings after me
succeding, neui^ to degrade their majesty and blud riall with lawar blud tha^
thaym self. For be ye way yai salbe lichtlit and co^tempnit with yair awin
subdittis, and in na estimation amang uncouth princis. King Robert tuk sic
malancoly for ye taking of his son with Inglisme^ on yis manner, yat he
deceissit sone after, In ye.xvi. eir of his regne. fra ye
incarnation.i.M.iiii.C.vi. eres, and was buryit in Paslay with his queen
Annabell before rehersit. King Robert was ane man of great stature. richt
lyberall and gracious in all his werkis* howbeit he was me^eit be ane straik of
ane horse as we have schawin. he was richt fervent in his devotion, and sa
mercyful to ye pepyl, yt he wald suffer na iniures done aganis yame but
punitioun. Gyf he mycht have past throw the cuntre but impediment of his feit,
ye realm should have been gouernit with na les felicite in his dayis tha^ it was
in any other princis time before. Duk Robert eft his deith was chosin be new
election governor, and gi^it ye realm after ye kingis deith with better
Justice than before. In ye mean time ye castle of Iedburgh was taken be men of
Teuydale, and cass^n down to ye ground. Archebald erl^ of Douglas herand that
king Robert was deceissit, maid ane way for his redemption, and returnit i^
scotland. Not lang after ane cou^sal was set to restore George earl of March^
to his honor and laudis. After lang disputation it was concludit, yat he should
want ane part of his landis namit Annerdale and Lochmaben, and ye said la^dis
to pas under perpetual dominion of ye Douglas. Be their co^ditionis the earl of
March was restorit to his landis and peace.

How the university of sanct Andros tuk beginning. How great virtevv and
police was brocht in scotland be king James the first. how great skaith fallis
in this realm be promotion of vicius prelatis. Ca. xvii.
AT this time raise great trubil in scotland be Donald of the Ilis. For Willyam
earl of Ros son to Hew Ros (quhilk was slane before at Halidoun hill) had two
douchteris, of quhilkes the eldest was geuyn in marriage to Walter Lesly with ye
erledome of Ros, and gat on her ane son namit Alexander, and ane douchter
quhilk was after maryit on Donald of the Ilis. This Alexander succedit to the
erledome of Ros after ye deith of his fader Walter, and marijt ane douchter
namyt Eufamia, quhylk was heritour to ye erledome of Ros, The duke of Albany
persuadit this Effem (quhen scho was oung but any experience) to resing ye said
erledome in his handis under this condition. Gi^scho deceissit without airis of
her body, the said erledome sall cum to his secound son John^ earl of
Buchquhan. And gif ye said Iohne deceissit but airis male gottin of his body
his brothir Robert sal succeid. And faileing of his airis male in ye same manner
the erledome of Ros sal cum than to the croun. Their thingis done than with great
slicht, Effem deceissit be industry (as was beleuit) of duke Robert, yat the
erledome should cum to his son. Be this way Iohne duke Robertis secound son,
quhilk was earl of Buchquhan before, was maid earl of Ros, and left bot ane
douchter behynd him, quhilk was maryit on Wyllyam Seytoun knicht. For their
causis ye Seytonis clamit ye lordschip of Buchquhan. Donald of the Ilis herand
his wiffis ant deceissit, come to duke Robert, desiring ye landis of Ros to be
geuyn to him as nerrest and lauchfull heritour yairto. Nochthels he gat not bot
repuls. And thairfore he come with all the power of ye Ilis and subdewit Ros to
his opinion. nocht content of their bou^dis he come throw Murray, Bogheual, and
syndry other boundis lyand their about. Syne come to Garioch to birne Abirdene.
To punis their attemptatis come Alexander Stewart earl of Mar, and faucht
aganis ye said Donald at Harlaw, quhair great slauchter was maid on all sydis.
In this battall.ix.C. hyeland men war slane with Makclane, and Makinthos,

prouest of Abirdene knichtis with money other. Yis battall was strikin on sanct
James even ye eir of god.i.M.iiii.C.xi. eris. Donald after this discomfitoure
fled with great deligence to the Ilis. Nochtheles duke Robert persewit the said
Donald so scharply, yat he come in will after yt he was sworn neuir to invade ye
realm with mair trubyll. Nocht lang after yis battal, Patrik Dunbar secound
son to ye earl of March, wan Fast castle, and tuke Thomas Haldane capitane
thairof presoner. At this time ye brig of Roxburgh was brokin be Wyllya^
Douglas of Drumlanerik, and the town of Roxburgh brint. And in this ylk eir
began ye university of sanct Andros. Money excellent and noble clerkis war
brocht out of syndry cuntreis to be preceptouris in it. Followit great
confluence of oung pepyl out of al partis of scotland for desire of letteris,
throw great exercition of virtew, quhilk began to spreid fast in this cuntr^,
^pecially at the cumyng hame of king James the first in Scotland. ^his noble

Na man was promouit to bischoprikis in his dayis with out he war of syngular

In they dayis quhen may grave personis of may erudition and virtew war

How the erllis of Buchquhan and VVigtoun went with great armyis in support
of France. and of the deith of duke Robert. Ca. xviii.
IN this ylk time Iohne Drummond slew treasonabilly Patrik Graham earl of
Strathern. Nocht withstandyng the assurance taken betuix thaym. The nobyllis
maid sic diligence, that this Drummond was fynaly takin, and punist for the
said crime. Nocht lang after raise great weris betuix Charlis the.vi. king of
France, and Hary ye v. king of Ingland. King Charlis held syndry landis of
france fra king Hary, howbeit they pertenit to him be just heritage. At last
king Hary be lang sege wan the town of Hunflew. Syne with proud baner come
throw Picardy and waistit all boundis thairof quhill he come to Blainge. And
quhen he was returnyng in Ingland, come on him syndry princis and gaif him
battall. Nochtheles yai war al slane, and their army discomfist. In the mean
time king Hary was aduertist of great rebellioun maid aganis him in Walis. Throw
quhilk he was constranit, nocht withstanding yis victory to return in Ingland.
After his cumyng met him the prince of Walis with money great princis of England
of his opinion, and gaif him battall and put king Hary to flicht. King Hary not
withstanding this discomfitour come agane with new army in Walis, and brocht
thaym at last to irrecouerabyll subjection, Quhil sic thingis war done in
Ingland, Wyllya^ Halyburtoun wan ye castle of Werk, and slew al personis found
in it. Howbeit it succedit sone after to his great infelicite. For syndry
Inglismen knew all the secretis of ye place, and clam up throw ane scheild, and
brak the wall in sic manner that yai maid ane quiet passage to their fallowis.
Thus was the castle taken be Inglismen, and all scottis fou^din in it slane.
About this time was ane great sisme in the kirk, three papis creat atanis. To
repair their arrouris followit the cou^sall of Constantine, in the quhilk their
three papis war eieckit, and ye fourt creat be the said counsall. In ye eir fra
our redemption.i.M.iiii.C.xix. the third day of September deceissit Robert duke
of Albany, quhilk was governor of Scotland.xv. eris after the deith of king
Robert ye third ane vaileant and noble prince all his dayis. King Charlis at
this time send in scotland the earl of Uandoun and chancellar of France to geit
support of scottis aganis Ingland, and promittit great wagis, landis, and
officis till all scottis that wald cum in defense of his realm. Sone after
John^ stewart earl of Buchquhan secund son to duk Robert, and Archebald Douglas
earl of Wigtoun past in france with.vii.M. armit me^ and war tenderly ressauit
be king Charlis. This ordinance of scottis cumand (as said is) in france maid
king Hary of Ingland richt co^mouit. And thairfore to cause the said ordinance
to depart out of france, he gart ye nois and rumor pas throw all boundis of
his realm, that he was to cum haistely with ane army on the Scottis. For feir
of their nouellis the scottis lay all the nixt symer on the bordouris ab^dand the
cumyng of his army. In ye mean time king Hary past in Normandy, and oppressed ye
inhabitantis thairof with great iniuris, and subdewit the town of Roan to his
empire. At last quhen he was cumyn to may triumph of victory, abyll to have
gottin the haill dominioun of france, he was vincust be ane lady, and gaif his
besynes fra cheuelry to lust and amouris. Be this way king Hary put end to his
weris and tuke Katrine the douchter of Charlis the vi. of that name king of
France in marriage under their conditionis. Gif king Charlis deceissit before king
Hary, the said king Hary sall succeid to the crown of France. And gif Hary
deceissit first, leua^d behynd him ane son gottin on the said king Charlis
douchter this son sall succeid to the crown of france after ye deith of king
Charlis. Be quhilk co^ditioun king Charlis son was spuleit of all richt yt he
had to ye croun of france, and king Charlis to regne allanerly during his life.
This peace schort time indurit, and thairfore the said erllis of Buchquhan and
Wigtoun with their ordinance war ye mair plesandly tretit be ye king and
dalphine of france, and gat the town of Casteltoun with the castle thairof to
remane in till quhill they had schawin sum honest vassalage.

How the duke of Clarence was slane with money other lordis of England at
Bauge. of the deith of king Hary and king Charlis. Ca. xix.
NOw war ye erllis of Buchquhan and Wigtoun aduertist, yat Thomas duk of
Clarence was cumyng with.x.M. men to sege ye town and castle of Bauge, with
other syndry landis of Orleance, quhilk pertenit to the dalphyne of France. The
earl of Buchquhan knawing ye subtell slichtes of Inglismen, send his cousyn
schir Iohne Stewart of Dernely knycht to spy their army, bot he was sone after
chasit to the scottis, and schew how the duke was cumand with all his ordinance
in arrayit battall on thaym. The scottis incontinent went to harnes, and met ye
duk of Clarence on ane plane beside the said town, quhare both ye armyis
ruschit togidder in may fury. At ye first ^unyng Thomas duke of Clarence was
hurt in the face with ane speir be the knycht of Swintoun, and was after slane
be the earl of Buchquhan. The resydew of Inglismen astonist be slauchter of the
duke of Clarence and other great princis o^ yair land gaif bakkis. The scottis
^eissit not fra co^tinewal chase of Inglisme^ quhil it was far run within ye
nicht. In this battall war slane ye duke of Clarence, ye earl of Reiddisdale,
lord Ros, lord Gray and money other great baronis to ye nowmer of.xvi.C. and of
yame war takin the earl of Huntingtoun, ye earl of Somerside and his brothir
quhilkis war brethir to king James ye firstis wife. This battal was strikin on
Pasche euin fra our rede^ptioun.i.M.iiii.C.xxi. eris. The dalphyne of france
glaid of this victory gaif syndry la^dis to ye earl of Buchquhan, and maid him
constable of france. King Hary mouit in great Ire for slaucht of his brothir ye
duk of Clarence. come with ane new army in France, and had with him James
prince of scotland, traisting to draw ye scottis out of france be his
auctorite. For the dalphyne of france raise ylk day in mair pissance and honor
be vassalage of syndry chosyn campionis of scotland* King Hary schort time
after send for the said prince to cum to the counsall, quhare he was auising
with his noblis be quhat ingyne and slichtis he mycht best invade his ennymes.
King Hary at ye cumyng of the said James, began to schaw quhat displesei^ been
done to him be scottis both in Ingland and france. After yat he had schawin
money humaniteis done to him and his fader king Robert, he desirit ye said James
to pas to the scottis in france, and to command yame in his name to return in
scotland. King Hary promittit, gif the said James brocht yis matter to good
effect, not only to remit hes ransoun, bot to send him in scotland with great
riches and honor. To yir wordis answerit James. In sa far as thou noble prince
hes schawin or will schaw any humanyteis towart me. I sall laubour sa far as is
in me to do ye pleseir effering yairto* Nochtheles as to this matter quhilk thou
desiris me to labor* I meruel nocht lityll, yat thou co^sideris nocht how I
have na power above ye scottis sa lang as I am ane private man and haldin in
captivity. Nochtheles were I put to liberte and the scottis maid my lawchfull
subdittis, I wald glaidlie laubour all materis to thy pleseir. Als sone as he
had said their wordis, he departit fra ye counsall. Yan said king Hary, may
happy people sall they be, yat happinnis to get on nobil man to yair prince.
Money ieoperdeis and frequent skarmussing were maid in yis eir betuix ye Dalphyne
of France and Inglismen. Ye Inglismen had this time all Normandy and Gascone
under their empire, and bure sic hatrent aganis ye scottis, yat yai slew yame
quhare yai were taken with may schamefull deid. Howbeit they vsit not sic
cruelteis on other pepill. Quhen king Hary had distroyit sindry boundis of
Bryane with great heirschippis and slaucht, he inuadit ye landis and kirk of
sanct Fyacre, and be vengeance of god he was strikin with sic infirmite, that
na ingyne of man mycht cure him. At last quhen he had demandit ye medicinares,
quhat maledy yis been falling to him sa haistely, they said. it was ye maledy
of sanct Fiacre, quhilk was sumtyme ane Scot and discendit of the nobill blude
thairof. Yan said king Hary. I se nocht bot all scottis born in perditioun of
ws, quhilkis ar aye sa great ennymes to ws leiffand and deid, at hame and on
field. For they persew ws with na les hatrent now quhen they ar eikit amang the
noumer of sanctis, than quhen yai were in to this present life. King Hary seeing
hes infirmite incres ilk day more, causit him to be brocht to Cornwel, quhare
he miserabilly deceissit and was brocht in ane cape of leid in Ingland, and
buryit amang ye sepulturis of other kyngis. At this time Charlis ye.vi. king of
France deceissit. Eftir quhom succedit Charlis ye vii. of yat name. Be quhais
deith ye great fervor of weris began to cule betuix Inglismen and scottis. And
for that cause the erlis of Buchquhan and Wigtoun returnit in Scotland, sone
eftir their returnyng yai come with ane army to Berwik, and lay lang at the
sege thairof but any werkis worthy to have memory. And thairfore this Iurnay
was callit the dirtin raid.

How the franchemen and scottis war discomfist at VVernoll. and of great

EFtir deith of duk Robert, his son Mordo Stewart earl of Fiffe and Menteith
was maid governor, and Iosit the said office four eris. Howbeit he was rycht
vnganand thairto. For he had nocht sic wisdom and manheid as his fader duke
Robert had before him. He was ane soft prince but any fortitude in aduersite, or
temporance in prosperity. Su^ time he apperit so febill, yat na consolatioun
mycht raise him in esperance of bett fortoun, sum time he was ouir severe and
more cruel in executioun of Justice than ye matter requirit, and so necligent
in chastifying of his sonnis Walter and Alexander, that yai finalie conspirit
aganis him, vncertane quhidder ye same procedit be softnes of his mind, in so
far yat he couth nocht punys ye iniquiteis of his sonnis for the fervent luf
and affection he had to yame. Or gif their faltis were so great, that yai
deseruit more punition tha^ he micht use on yame. For they were delatit of
sindry oppressionis be the pepil. Yis Walter incurrit extreme indignation of
his fader for ane falcon, quhilk he slew in co^temptioun of his fader. Because
his fader wald not gif him the said falcon with pleseir, he slew the halk upon
hes faderis hand. Duk Mordo mouit with yis great co^temptioun said. O Walter sen
thou and thy brothir will not be rewlit be my soft empire, I sall bring him
hame, that sal chaistifie ow and me both. Sone eftir he co^uenit all his
noblis to ane counsall. And desirit thaym to send ambassatouris in Ingland, for
redemptioun of James the first of y^ name, that he mycht return in Scotland,
and ressaue ye governance yair of. Oftymes great feliciteis cumis be contentioun
of unhappy parteis inuadyng other with athir iniuris, as happinnit at this time
be yis haisty debait rising betuix duk Mordo and his sonnis, for were nocht
their contentioun, James the first had neuir cumyn in Scotland, the quhilk had
been rycht da^mageus to the realm. Bot we will return to our history. The
earl of Buchquhan constable of France beleuit litill proffet or pleseir to fall
to him be ye hame cumyng of James the first. Because his fader duk Robert held
him so lang out of his realm. And thairfore he solistit his gudfader Archebald
earl of douglas to pas with him i^ France. Sone eftir ye said erlis past
with.x.M. chosyn men in France. And were ressauit with great honor be Charlis
ye.vii. king of France. And eftir that the king had put all their folkis in
ordinance, he maid the earl of Douglas duk of Turyne. For he was ane nobill
man. Howbeit he was more vaileant yan fortunat. In ye mean time the duk of
Bedfurd lieutenand to ye king of England come with great army in France. And
eftir yat he had wyn money townis and villagis in France, he segit ane town
namit Liver, and brocht it to sic necessite, that ye capitane thairof gaif
plegis to rander it to Inglisme^, Gif he gat na rescours within schort time.
King Charllis knawand ye castle forsaid in sic dangeir, send the duk of Lanson
and the erlis of Buchquhan and Douglas with the residew of his army to rescours
the said house. Before yair cu^in they were aduertist, that Inglismen had gottin
ye house randerit to yame and taken ane other town of Normandy namit Warnol.
Incontinent they went to harnes and arrayit them on the plane nocht far fra ye
town. And quhen ye armyis were reddy to June the duk of Lanson richt inuyful,
yat scottis should rise in any landis or honouris within France, come away
with.xx.M. men. The erlis of Douglas and Buchquhan nochtwithstanding this
treason ruschit forthwart with pert curage on their ennymes, and faucht with
great manheid to the deith. Nochtheles both the armyis of Scotland and France
were finaly discomfist and put flycht. In yis unhappy battall were slane Iohne
earl of Buchquhan constable of France, Archebald earl of Douglas duke of Turyne
and lieutenand of France, Archebald Douglas his son earl of Wigtoun with money
of all the scottis cumpany. Their bodyis were buryit with great lament of pepill
in the kirk of sanct Graciane within the town of Turyne. And of francheme^ were
slane the earl of Uentodore, the sereif of Narbone with money other Wag^ouris
and co^monis to ye noumer of.vi.M. and of thaym were taikin ye marcheall of

Of great Justice done be king James the first in all partis of Scotland. Of the
natiuite of James the secund. of syndry actis done be the said noble prince
James the first. Ca. iii.
THis trubyll dantit in manner foresaid king James past throw al boundis of his
realm, and punist money strange lymmaris and oppressouris of his pepyl to the
deith. Na remissioun geuyn before be the governor was admittit before his
Justice, for they war expirit be his death. Attoure the king thocht it nocht
pl^sand to god nor proffitable to the common weil, that sa money slauchteris,
reiffis, and oppressionis done before in the cuntre for falt of Justice wa^
vnpunist. It is said, the first two eris of his regne.iii.M. pepyll wa^ slane
be his Justice for syndry auld crimes and offe^cis co^mittit aganis ye pepyll
in the eris before. And yocht these punition apperit sufficient yneuch to all
pepyll in his realm. it ane lymmer namit Angus Duffe of Strathern come with
ane cu^pany of theuis and tuk ane great pray of gudis out of Murray and Cathnes.
Incontinent followit on him Angus Murray with great power. And this other Angus
Duffe na thing affrayit of his cumyng met him on ye same manner at Strachnauern.
Followit ane scharp battal f^chtin with sic cruelte on ylk side yat.xii.
personis war left only on live. King James herand yis slauchter said. He was
na les sorrowful for the slauchter of the men of Cathnes than Murray. Howbeit
nane was left on live that mycht be punist for the offense thairof. At yis time
was ane other great lymmer namit Makdonald Ros, quhilk grew be spuleis and
heirschippis of ye pepyl in great riches. Yis lymmer schod ane pure wed^ with
horse schone, because scho said scho should gang to the king, and reuele his wekit

The nixt was James the secund, quhilk succedit immediately after his fader to ye

quhilk succedit eft him to ye erldome of Douglas. In ye nixt eir after the king
arrestit Archebald earl of Douglas duke of Turyne, and held him in lang
captivity and ward. At last be supplication of the queen and other great
prelatis of the realm ye king remittit his offencis, and put both him and
Alexander earl of Ros to liberte. Als sone as ye realm was brocht to good
tranquillite on this manner, ya^ passingeris micht travel but trubyll in all
partis thairof, he maid officiaris and iugis to pas throw all partis of his
realm, yat Justice micht have place als weil i^ hie as ye law partis. He
causit the prouestis and baileis of ylk town to use veschel of just mesuris,
concerning ye interchange of vittallis wine and aill. Other (...) y^ war not
markit with the mark (...) the baileis or prouest war brokin. And the
occupiaris yair of co^dampnit in great sowmes of money. At last quhen he had
reparit ye stre^thes of his realm with siclike munitionis as afferit, he
veseit the university of sanct Androis, oftimes present at their general
disputationis and tuk sic pleseir their intyl, that he dotat the university
with syndry preuilegis, and gaif thaym power to cheis may perfect personis,
that he mycht put thaym to great prelacyis of scotland as they vakit. Thus war
men ay promouit to benifices effering to their eruditioun and knawlege.
Yairfore all manner of virtew spread fast during his time, and above al other
commoditeis the service of god incressit with great reverence and honor in
may crafty musik as it occurris to our dayis. In the nixt eir quhilk was fra
our salvation.i.M* iiii.C.xxxi. Hary the.vi. king of Ingland come to Paris and
was crownit in nostre dames kirk haua^d bot xii. eris of age. And it he was
with in few eris after put both fra the empire of Ingland and France, and come
fugitive to king James the third, be quhome he was plesandly ressauit. And it
he was ane notabyl example of ye vnstabyl and vnsickir chance of fortoun. Sen
he that was sum time king of two may pissant ki^gdomes, was put fra yame
both, and constranit to seek refuge at uncouth pepyll.

How the bischop of sanct Androi^ be lang precheing dissuadit the riottus
custom of bankettis. Ca. iiii.
NOcht lang after was ane Parlyament at Perth. Amang money other acts done at
these Parlyament to remove ye surfeit expensis maid in riottus cheir and
bankettis quhilkis war brocht in scotland be Inglismen at the hame cumyng of
king James to na les damage of ma^nis bodyis, than wasting of yair guddis.
Raise up Hary wardlaw bischop of sanct Androis, and said in this manner. Suppos
money nobyl works (may wise prince) ar brocht in this realm be thy cumyng.
As Justice, religion, and polesy, with money other good lawis to the proffet of

auance thy realm. All honest maneris vsit before amang ws at be thy wisdom

yair is ane lurkand pest fast burgeand with sic irremediable ve^nome, ye gif yt
samyn be not haistely remedyit, all their commoditeis brocht be thy cu^yng in
yis realm salbe of little effect. The noblis yt sittis heir in thy p^sence hes
desirit me till schaw this matter in yair name. And to desire thy hyen^s to schaw
thy wisdom als weill in this matter, as in other thingis be ye done. Syndry
nobyll men (sic as war thy freindis i^ Ingland) ar cumin in this cuntre not
unworthy to have thy favor. Howbeit yai have brocht with yame the maneris of
Inglismen, qu^^lkis ar richt da^mageus to thy pepyll. And youcht their maneris
be not schamfully to yair awin cuntre, because yair pepil is accustomit yair
with. I think it is ane great syn to cut thy pepyll in to sic vennomus maneris.
I mean their superflew and costlye coursis of metis yt they persuade me^ to eit
and drink mair than is sufficient to the nuttsing of nature. Will thou
considder the temperance vsit amang our auld faderis, thou sall find na thing
sa contrarius thairto, as this new glotony brocht now amang ws. And it I wait
not quhid der this sorrowful pest i^ ^^myn amang ws mair in our awin defalt or
be defalt of Inglismen. Considder we have geuyn place yairto so sone. it in
quhatsumeuir way this unhappy custom is cum amang ws. It is to be contempnit,
for the money vicis that followis their upon sic as ar intemperance, lust,
sleuth, reif, and waisting of gudis. For gif te^pera^ce be nurisar of al
virtew. Than inte^perance is mother till al vice. For this lust and intemperance
ar sa knit togidder, that they may na wayis be seuerit fra other. And he yt is
seruand to his wambe, man obey al thingis yt it desiris, Than followis be lust
of wambe, defloration of virginis, Adultre, and incest. Their mischeu^s and
vennome of oung me^ followis only be superflewite of me^is and drinks. And
fra ane man be geuin anis to plesei^ of his wambe, he becumis ydill but any

the mair feirsly rynnis he till every kind of vice. And yocht ane man have
waistit his patrimony in sic superflew meitis and drinkis, it the vennome yt he
swelleis be feneit pleseir thairof sal neuir seuir fra hi^, quhil he be deid.
Be their and siclik wordis bischop Hary dissuadit the king and his pepyl fra al
superflew coursis and immoderat bankettis. Nochtheles this intemperance is
risyn to sa insatiabil voracite, ^at na foul in ye air nor fische in ye see ar
sufficient to satify ye hungry appetite of gl^tonis, quhill yair wambe be sa
boldin, that they may not draw their aynd, with money other siclik skaith^^

Of the sege of Roxburgh. How ye king brocht money craftismen in this realm.
how Paul Cravv vva^ brint and ye charturaris of Perth foundit. Ca. v.
IN ye same eir ye.xvii. day of Iuny was ane terribil eclipse of the Son

the king past with ane army to sege the castle of Marchmond, yt is to say
Roxburgh. The Scottis war nowmerit in this army to.ii.C.M. men by futmen and
caragemen. At last quhen the king had live at ye sege foresaid.xv. dayis and
waistit al his munittoun and powder, he returnit hame but any mair felicite
succeding to hes army. Sone after the returnyng of the army deceissit Robert
Cardin bischop of Du^keld. After quhome succedit bischop James Kennedy the

Ueneration of sanctis, and confession to be maid to preistis. At last he was
brocht before the Theologis and al his opinionis condampnit. And because he
perseuerit obstinatly to the end of his pley, he was condampnit and brint. He
confessit before his deith that he was send out of Beum to preiche to scottis ye
herisyis of Hus and Wiccleif. The king commendit mekyl this punition, and gaif
the abbacy of Melros to Iohne Fogo. For he was principal co^uikar of this
Paul. King James (quhen the realm was brocht to great tranquillite and peace)
on this manner, past oftymes amang his subdittis specially his marchandis, to
that fine that na thing should be unknown to him in his realm. At last quhen he
had considderit the maneris of their banketting, he r^preuit thaym, because they
suff^ri^ men to pay in thai^ houssis, after yat they war callyt to their
dy^naris and supparis. At this time was foundit the abbay of Charturaris monkis

Scotland wald assent yairto, to geif ouir Berwik with all the landis lyand

THe eir fra the incarnation.i. thousand iiii. hundred.xxxiii. eris. the king

Of the slauchter of king James the first, and of the punition yat was maid
yairfore, and of syndry meruellis seen in Albion, Ca. viii.
Great myscheif and sorrow followit in scotland after this discomfitour of
Inglismen at Piperden be hid wachsing of Walter Stewart earl of Athole, quhilk
pretendit ay ane richt to the crown, be reason yat he was gottyn be king Robert
ye secund on his first wife. This earl (as we schew before in ye genology of
stewardis) was the principal mouar of Robert duk of Albany to sla David Steward
duk of Rothesay. And after the hame cumyng of James the first, he solistit the
said king to slay duk Mordo with all other duk Robertis lynnage. Traisting
quhe^ their nobyll men war put down to find sum hyd way to slay the king and his
barnis, that he mycht thairefter succeed to the crown. And because all duke
Robertis sonnis war deceissit, sum of thaym slane at the battal of Uernoll and
otheris Iustifyit be king James, he perswadit Robert Stewart his nepot and
Robert grahame his cousyn to slay the king. This Robert was before at the kyngis
horn, for syndry great offensis done be him aganis the kingis auctorite, and
had na thing in mair hatrent than the king. Their unhappy tratouris lyand (as
said is) in wait to espy ganand time to fulfill their cursit purpos, come sone
after to ye blak freris of Perth, quhare ye king was lugit for ye time. And be
license of the portaris they enterit in ye kingis hall. Purposyng to have
remanit their quhyll the cumyng of ane other familiar seruand to the king to
have gottyn entres in the kingis secret chalmar be his way. For he was
participant with thaym in the said treasoun. it before ye cumyng of yis man, ane
servant namit Walter Straroun opnit the dure, and went forth to ressaue wine to
the kyngis collation. Als sone as he saw thaym aufully arrayit at the dure he
cryit treason, And maid him with all his strenth to return agane. Nochtheles he
was sone slane. it the slayng of him maid sic tarry to the laif, yat ane oung
madyn namit Katherine douglas (quhilk was after maryit on Alexander Louell of
Bolunny) slekit the dure. And because ye bar was away yat should have closit the
^ure, scho schot her arm in to the place quhare the bar should have passit scho
was bot oung and her bonis not so (...), and thairfore her arm was sone ^rokin
in schonder, and ye dure doung (...) be force. Incontinent they ^nte^^. And
after yat they had slane the ^^miliar seruandis yat maid debait (...) the time,
they slew the king with ^^ny cruel woundis, and hurt the ^^ene in his defense.
The principal man yt maid debait at yis time was Patrik Dunbar brothir to
George ^^^quhill earl of March, and was le^t for deid in the chalmer in his
defense. This prince was of mine sta^u^e, braid schulderit and small wais^it with
all his membris sa weil proporcionat, yt na thing faileit in him yat mycht be
geuyn be nature. Ane of the may virtuous princis yt euir was before his dayis,
richt just in all his life, and scharp punisar of vice. He was slane ye.xxi.
day of Februar. the.xliiii. eir of his aige, in the.xiii. eir of his regne. fra
our redemption ane.M.iiii.C.xxxvi. eris, His body was buryit in the abbay of
charteraris, quhilk he fundit schort time before his deith, The nobillis rycht
sorrowful for hes slauchter, maid great deligence in sercheing of their forenamit
tratouris. Quhill at last they war all apprehendit and brocht to Edinburgh,
quhair they war punist in this manner. The earl of Athole (quhylk was pryncypall
mouar of this treason) was first spuleit of all his claithis, saif only ane
lynnyn curche to hyd his private memberis. Incontinent was maid ane instrument
of tree like the drawer of ane well. And after that they had festenit it in ane
cart, they band this earl upon the point of the said drawer, and eid with ye
said cart throw ye town. Sum time rasand this tratour, ya^ the pepyl micht se
him hie in ye air. and leit him fall down with ane swak upon the gait. Syne
brocht him to ane place* quhare may confluence was of pepyll, and crownit him
with hait yrne. For ane weche said to him he should be crownit king before his
deith. Their illusionis causit him to leif ay under vane esperance to conques
the crown. On the morrow yis earl was harlit with his complicis throw all
streitis of the town. On ye third day his wambe was opnit, and his bowellis
taken forth and cassyn flichtrand in the fire before his ene. After al torments
his heart was taken out of his body and cassyn in ye fire. His heid was schorne
fra hes body, and his body quarterit. His nepot Robert stewart was punist on ye
same manner. Robert Grahame principal slayar of the king was harlit throw the
town in ane cart, and the hand that slew the king, bound thairto, and hait yrne
schot throw al partis of hes body, specially quhare ya^ beleuit na haisly deid
following. And after great punition taken on him, he was demandit how he durst be
sa bald to sla the king. He answerit. It is bot folly to dema^d quhat ane man
dar do. I durst (said he) leip in hell, howbeit heuyn and hell war at my chois.
All wayis he was condingly punist on the same manner. In ye same time was in
scotland Eneas siluius ambassatour of Eugenius ye.iiii. pape of ye name ane man
of money letteris, and was send be ye said pape to trete peace betuix Inglismen
and scotts. Yis Eneas was eft for his syngular virtew maid pape of Rome.
Nochyeles quhe^ he was doing his era^dis may besaly in scotland, come yis
Inuy of fortoun, yt the prince was slane. And fra he saw him deid he said. Ye
scottis war not worthy to ioys any kingdoms or honouris bot gif they condigly
punist ye kingis slaucht. He co^mendit yame gretu^ly, quhen he saw sa scharp
punition maid for his slauchter. In the time of king James ye first war sindry
meruellis seen in Albion. Ane sow had her lytter with dog heidis. Ane calfe was
seen with ane horse heid. Ane comet apperit lang before the kingis deith with
(...) bemes, and sa vehement frost was in ye winter before, ye wine and ail was
sauld be pound wechtis and meltit agane be the fire. Ane swerd was seen fleand
in the air to na les terroure than admiration of pepyl. And sa endis heir
the.xvii. buke of their croniklis.

The epistil direckit be ye tra^slatoure to the kyngis grace.
ERasmus Roterodamus in his buke namit the institutioun of cristin kyngis,
schawis (may nobyl prince) na thing in mair admiration than werkis of kingis,
quhilkis ar sa patent to the sicht of pepyll, that every man hes thaym in mouth
to their commendation or repreif. Thus may na thing be sa fruteful to dant ye
co^moun errouris of pepyll, as honest and vixtewis life of kingis. For ye life
of kingis drawis yair subdittis to Imitation of yair werkis worthy or unworthy,
and the same cumis to lycht be impulsion of fortoun that na thing sufferis to
be hyd. Forthir in every history yat men redis, apperis evidently the same
maneris with ye pepyl, quhilkis ar vsit be the king. And sen na thing is, yt
the pepyl followis with mair Imitation, nor kepis in mair recent memory, tha^
werkis of nobil men. Of reason their besines should be mair respondent to virtew
tha^ of any other estatis. Amang money knichtly exercitionis vsit be nobyl
princis I find nane mair proffitable to yame, tha^ frequent reding of their and
other historyis. For in yame may be found money hailsome documentis. Attoure the
fruit of history is sa necessare yt but it, ye dedis of forcy campionis
suddandly euanissis. Be contrar the effect thairof causis they thingis
(quhilkis ar money eres gone) appear als recent in our memory, as they war bot
recently done. Thairfore said the moral poet Horace. He that eildis in his
awin cuntre, not following sic things as been done before him, for laik of
experience is bot ane barn, for their reasonis. (...) yt hes been our humyl
seruitour senour first infa^ce, hes tra^slatit ye history of scotland sen ye
first beginning thairof in our vulgar langage* yat our h^enes may know ye
vaileant and nobyl dedis done be our progenitouris. And have cognasance how
this realm hes been gouernit their xviii.C. eris bygane. quhilk was neuir
subdewit to uncouth empire, bot only to ye native princis yairof. Howbeit ye
same hes sustenit great truble be weris of romany, Inglisme^, and danis, with
sindry cha^cis of fortoun. Heir may our hienes vndstand how our realm should be
gouernit in Justice, and quhat persons ar may abil to beir auctorite or
office yair intil, seand money of our eldares degenerat fra virtew after yt they
war accumpanyi^ with oung and insolent pepyll, vane fleschouris, quhilkis had
na regard to the weil nor honor of their prince, bot only to their own
co^moditeis. I dout not bot on ye same manner ar money personis now dependyng on
our hienes, so vennomit with avarice, that our grace can assa^^e na thing sa
da^magius to our honor or princely estate. Bot the same salbe weill commendit
be thaym gif they f^nd our will and pleseir set yairto. Nochtheles our hienes
is cumyn ^ow to sic perfection, that e understand weill quhay been presently
a^^saris, and quha best suffaris of our ^ommoun weil. Sen our mai^ste be (...)
manheid than wisdom, hes (...) this region, and brocht the same (...) rest,
good peace, and tra^quil^^^e. Howbeit the samyn couth nocht (...) done be our
great baronis during (...) ^ender aige. Apperis thairfore (...) nobyll and
worthy deidis pro^^dis mai^ be natural inclinatioun and active cu^age, than
any gudly pe^suasioun of assisteris. And yocht ^our hienes be dotat with ma
gif^is of nature, than hes been seen before with any other prince, Traist
ferme^^, gif sic preemin^nt giftis of nature (...) vnwa^ly abusit, na werkis
sall follow worthy to have memory. Thairfore my souera^^ I dare baldly afferme
na other besines sall be mair fruitful to our hienes, tha^ frequent reding of
their and siclik historyis. For sic thingis sall nocht only move ow to
Imitation of virtew. Bot sall infound na les experience and wisdom, tha^ e war
trauellit throw the world, or agit be lang pr^^es of eris, seand sa money
exemplis of virtewis and vi^ius leuing with sic illuster dedis of armis, that
gif our^ eldaris had possedit prudence equaualent to their innatiue manheid* na
pepyl of reason mycht have been preferrit to thaym in marciall glore. As at
mair lenth apperis in ^edyng of this history. Heir sall our grace understand
how inuiolatly the faith of Crist hes been obseruit be our progenitouris,
neuir abarrand fra sicker religion and piete. Heir sal the bra^d difference be
knawin betuix kingis and tyra^nis. For as Seneca sayis in his tragideis. All ar
nocht kingis that been clothit with purpour and diadem, Bot only they that
sekis na singular proffet in damage of their co^moun weill, and sa vigilant
that ye life of yair subdittis is mair deir and precius to thaym, than yair
awin life. Ane tyrane sekis riches, ane king sekis honor conquest be virtew.
Ane tyrane gouernis his realm be slauchter, dredoure, and falset. Ane king
gidis hes realm be prudence, integrite, and favor. Ane tyrane suspeckis all
thaym tha^ hes riches, great dominioun, auctorite, or great rentis. Ane king
haldis sic men for his may helply frei^dis. Ane tyrane luffis nane bot vane
fleschou^es vicius and wickit lymma^is, be quhais counsall he rages in
slauchter and tyranny. Ane king luffis men of wisdom, grauite and science,
knawing weill that his great materis may be weill dressit be their prudence.
Tr^uth is ye kyngis and tyrannis hes money handis, money ene* and money mo
members. Ane tyrane settis him to be dr^d. Ane king to be ^u^fit. Ane tyrane
reiosis to make his pepyll pu^e. Ane king to make yame rich. Ane tyrane drawis
hes pepyl to syndry factionis, discord, and hatrent. Ane king makes peace,
tranquillite, and concord, knawing na thing s^ dammagious as di^ision amang his
subditis. Ane tyrane confoundis all divine and humane lawis. Ane king obseruis
thaym and reiosis in equite and Justice. All their properteis salbe patent in
reding ye lyuis of good and evil kingis in ye history p^cedent. Yus may our
hienes have great co^modite and pleseir be this foresaid story. For quhat thing
may be mair plesand, tha^ to se in yis present volume (as in ane cleir
myrroure) all the variance of time bygane. The syndry cha^cis of fortoun. The
bludy fechtyng, and terribyll berganis sa money eris continewit in the defense
of our realm and liberte, quhilk is fallyn to our hienes with great felicite.
Howbeit ye samyn hes oftymes been ransonit with may nobyll blude of our
antecessouris. Quhat is he that will nocht reiose to heir ye knichtly affaris of
they forcy campionis, king Robert Bruce, and Wyllyam Wallace. The first be
innatiue desire to recover his realm was brocht to sic calamite, yat money
dayis he durst nocht appeir in sicht of pepyl. Bot amang desertis leua^d on
rutis and herbs in esperance of better fortoun. Bot at last be his singular
manheid he come to sic preeminent glore, yt now he is reput may vaileant and
nobyl prince, yat was after or before his empire. Yis other of small beginning
be feirs curage and corporal strenth, not only put Inglismen out of Scotland,
bot als befeir of hes aufull visage put Edward king of Ingland to flicht. And
held all the bordouris fornence scotland waist. Siclik money other vaileant
princis hes been in this realm. As Caratak, Galdus, Ke^neth, Gregour, Fergus,
with money otheris precedent in this history. And youcht sum of our
progenitouris war degenerat fra virtew, followis little admiration. For of
Roman empriouris money war vicious. As Nero, Caligula, Helyogabalus, Domicius,
Co^modus, Uttellius with money otheris. And youcht their vicius dedis been
abhominabyll to their posterite, it ye deploration of their calamite sall move
the redaris to Imitatioun of virtew. For it was neuir hard bot ane man of
vicious life hes ane vicious ending* and nocht only kyngis and princis been
deieck it fra their imperial estait, quhen they war aberrant fra virtuous
discipline. Bot money nobyll baronis on that same manner* quhen they be proud
insolence war repugnant to their superior. Traist yairfore (my sovereign) our
hienes will be put with na les eloquence tha^ grauite in memory, to have fame as
it deseruis now presently in yis life. Beseikand the glorius and merciful lord
to geif ow grace to perseueir in sic felicite yt we our subdittis may have
sufficient motive to desire our hienes lang on live. The quhilk mot grant the
gratius god. Amen.
