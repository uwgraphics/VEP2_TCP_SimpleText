A work for householders / or for them yt have the gydynge or governance of
any company. Gadred and set forth by a professed brother of Syon Richard
whytforde. And newly corrected and prynted again with an addicion of policy for
housholdynge / set forth also by the same brother.



Unto the devout reders: Richard Whytforde a professed brother of Syon: due
salutacion in our lord god and most sweet savior Jesus.
The preface.
WHere I had sent forth this poor lesson unto a pryuate person and special
friend: the copy thereof came unto the sight of certain devout persons / that
were (as they said) well contented therewith / and edified thereby. So that they
instantly required me / to put it newly forth in common: supposyng in their
devout my^de / it should be unto other persons / as it seemed unto them /
edificatyue and profitable. I beseech our lord / it so may be. And that you
would not ascribe it unto any presumpcion in me / but rather unto their
devotion and charity. And with like heart and mind / so to receive it. The end
of ye preface.

The argument.
THe matter is directed princypally unto householders / or unto them that have
gydyng and governance of any company / for an order to be kept / both in
them self / and in the^ that they have in rule and charge. The end of the
argument.

The self lesson or counseyle.
GOod devout chrystyans / let us first consydre that all we ben mortal / as
well the rich as ye poor / ye young as the old / there is no dyffere^ce /
none except / al must needs dye. And though we live very long / yet shall we
dye shortly: for ye lengest life of this world / is very short. And yet have
we no certaynte / ne yet conjecture of knowledge / when / where / how / or in
what state we shall depart this life. And sure we ben / that as we ben found
at that time / so shall we be taken / and without respyte or delay / forthwith
shall we be presented and brought before ye high judge / that can not be
deceived / to make a count of all our life past / where no man of law may
speak for us / ne any excuse may serve us. Our own conscience shall there
speak and tell plain trothe / without craft or dissymulacyon / and (in a
moment / a twynclynge of an eye) shall clearly confess al our hole life / and
every wryncle and part thereof: which co^fessyon / if your life were good /
shall be unto our great honor / confort / reioycynge / and joy everlasting.
And contrary / if it were evil / it shall be unto our great shame and rebuke /
unto our endless sorrow and pain / and woe everlasting. We have need therefore to
be well ware / how we spend our time / how we pass this life / or rather how
this life passes us. And much shall it avail and profit unto ye health of our
souls often times to remember our last end. Eccli. vij.
The wise man says. In oi^bus operibus tuis / memorare nouissima tua etc. In all thy works (says he) remember thine ending day / and what things shall
come unto the at thy last end / and thou shall never do sin / ne continue
euerlasty^gly therein. The first point therefore of a good christian / is to
entende and purpose with good heart and constau^t mind / to avoid sin / and
dylyge^tly to study how to flee and beware of the occasions thereof. And tha^ to
appoint himself unto some customable course of good and profitable exercise.
Psalmo xxxiij.
Diuerte a malo / and fac bonu^ (says ye prophet) Turn away thy face / thy
heart / will and mind from all evil / and appoint thy self to work good
works. For a form therefore how to follow the same by co^tynuau^ce / I shall
show you my poor advise. I speak unto you good simple and devout souls /
that would feign live well your self / and also order and comfort all other
unto ye same. First than / begin with your self. And as soon as you do awake
in the morning / to arise for all day. First suddenly turn your mind and
remembrance unto almighty god / and than use (by contynuall custom) to make a
cross with your thombe upon your foreheed or front / in saying of these
words. In noi^e patris. and than an other cross upon your mouth / with these
words et filij. And the third cross upon your breast / saying et spu^s scti^.
ame^ And if your devotion be thereto / ye may again make one hole cross / from
your heed unto your fete / and from ye lift shulder unto ye right / saying
all together. In noi^e pr^is et filij et spu^s sancti. Ame^. That is to mean I
do bless and mark my self with the cognysau^ce and badge of Christ / in the
name of the father / and in the name of the sone / and in ye name of the holy
ghost / that is to say / the holy trynyte.iij. persons and one god. Tha^ say
or thy^ke after this form. Good lord god my maker and redemer / here now in
thy presence / I do (for this time and for all ye time of my hole life)
byquethe and by take / or rather do freely give my self / soul and body / with
all my heart and my^de undo the (good lord) and unto thy hands / to be thy
bond servant for ever / according unto ye promise made in my baptysme at ye
font stone. And here now I do ratyfy and newly co^fyrme the same and do fully
consent in heart and my^de thereto / never here after (by the help of thy
grace) to contrary ye same / but to co^tynue in thy laws (good lord) unto ye
end of my life. But where thou know (good lord) that I am a frail person
/ infirm / feeble and weyke / and (of my self) prone and ready / in thought /
word / and deed unto evil / from the begy^nynge of my life hitherto / I
beseech ye good lord god and father of all puyssau^ce and power / of all mighty
and strength / yt you will defend me from al mine enemies / and give me
spiritual strength and power / that I may (in the) vaynquyssh and overcome /
flee and avoid al such fraylte / light manners or disposicio^s / as should be
contrary to thy will and pleasure / and that (according unto this will of ye
spirit / which thy goodness has now freely given unto me) I may destroy the
will of the flesh / and so continue unto the end of my life. Genes. viij.
And yet (good lord) where thou know also yt I am but rude and unlearned /
without wit / wysdom and due knowledge of the and thy laws / all ignorant
and as an ydiote or fool in all good and spiritual understanding / I beseech
the (good lord god) yt art ye essencyall sone of god ye father / and unto
whom is appropriate all wit and wisdom / all science / co^nynge and
knowledge / and al right perceiving and understanding / ye you wylt grant me
ye due knowledge of thy self by right and true feyth / and the knowledge of all
thy benefits and gifts done to me and al mankind / and grace dewly to thank
ye for them. And also due knowledge of mine own self / of ye state and
condition of my life and co^uersacion / and specially of my wretchedness / with
due contrycyon for all my sins. And knowledge also of thy laws / will and
pleasure / so yt by no manner of ignorance or mysvnderstandynge / I do (at any
time) in work or deed / or in word or thought any thing contrary unto the
same. And thyrdly (good lord) where thou know also that I am often times
obstynate of my^de / froward and evil wylly / stubburne of stomach and unkind
of heart / dull negligent and slothful in all manner of goodness / I beseech the
good lord god holy ghost / that art ye spyryte and will of the father and of
the sone / and with them the same self essencyal god / unto whom is appropriate
and specially appointed / all bounte / all goodness / all grace and good will /
that you would vouchesafe to give me the grace of good will / so that I never
do / say / ne think / yt should be contrary unto thy will. And having unto
the ever a reuere^de dread / I may love ye for thy self / and al other in ye
(lord) and for the / so yt according unto the spiritual strength and
knowledge that thou have given me / I may apply my will holy unto thy will / so
that I have no will propre unto my self / but that my will be all thy will and
both (as much as may be possible) one will. And so I may here in this life
order my love / and come unto such perfeccion of fervent charity / that (by
thy grace) I may atteyn unto ye fruicyon of everlasting charity in thy joyful
presence Ame^. And good lord god father of heaven / I beseech ye take and
receive me thus unto thy grace / and have mercy and pity upon me and all thy
people. And thou lord god blessed sone of god the father / and savior and
redemer of ye world / have pite and mercy upon me and upon all christen
people. And loving lord god holy ghost and blessed spyrite of god / have
mercy and pite upon me and all ye world. Holy and blessed Trinite / one self
and same esse^cyall god / have pity and mercy upon me and all mine / and upon
all thy creatures. Amen. And than ones again bless the with In noi^e pr^is.
as before / and than go forth unto your business where ye will. Let this be
for your morning exercise. And though you yt have great things to do / would
think this prayer and morny^ge exercise over long / because of your besynes I
a certain you / if it were ones (by use) gotten ready and incorporate / and
prynted in the heart and mind / it would soon be said or thought / and the
person should (I believe) have grace to speed the better in other things / and
nothing for think of the spendyng of the time / but rather accounte it for
great gaynes / in somoche that we purpose to set forth in ye end a longer
exercise / for the^ that have longer time to spend / but now we shall go forth
herein. After ye said morrow exercise I trust you will be well occupied upon
your appointed course of occupacyon. For yt was our counsel in ye begy^nynge
/ yt ye should appoint your self (by a continual course) unto some certain
occupacion that may be profitable / and ever to avoid ydlenes ye mother and
nurse of all sin and evil. And ever be ware of such occupacions as be^
called co^munly pastymes / yt is to say / all manner of unlawful games / and
such dysportes as done draw people rather to vice than to virtue / which
more properly may be called lose times tha^ pastimes. Math. xij. c.
For sith (by the affirmacion of our savior) we shall make account of every
idle word / it must needs follow yt we shall make a more strayte reckoning of
every idle or evil work. Let therefore your said appointed occupacyon be always
good / virtuous and profitable. Sith tha^ ye must needs make a rekeny^g of
every work / word and thought (for none of these ca^ be hyd or kept preuy
from your auditour) me thinks it should be a great surety for you / to make
every day ones your said accounte by your self. The common proverb is /
that often reckoning holds long felawshyp. I would advise you therefore to
spend some time thereupon at night after al your occupacions / before your bed
/ there knele down / and there begin to remember wheder ye went and what ye
did immedyatly after your morrow exercise / and in what company ye were / and
what was there your behauyour and demeanor / in work / word / or thought /
and so go forth unto eueri place / time and company as brekefast / dinner /
souper / or drynkyng / and where you find or perceive any thing that was good
/ virtuous and profitable / ascribe and apply ye unto our lord god / and give
unto him all the glory / laud and praise thereof / for he alone is ye gyuer of
all goodness / and so over pass that thing lightly. And where ye remember of
any special thing done / said / or thought amysse / stycke and bide thereupon
/ and bulte it (as they say) and turn it up so down / and try the weight and
danger thereof / with all ye manner and cyrcu^staunce of the same. So may ye
know the quantyte thereof / that is to say / how great a sin or howly tell it
is / how be it / none offense can be little ye does offend god / and surely
every sin / is offense done unto god / all though it seem to be done unto
man. j. Ioh. ij. d.
For as ye love of god does begin at ye love of ye neighbor (For he yt loves
not his neighbor) whom he may se with his bodyly eye or sight (says saint
John^) how may he love god (whom he can not so se) so in like manner the offense
of ye neighbor is forth with ye offense of god. Consider therefore unto whom
the trespace is done / and so ye consyderacyon with the other qualytes and
quantites of the sin / shall bring you unto a basshme^t thereof / and to be
sorry therefore / or (at the leest) to will or wysshe that ye had not so done.
Than mekely cry god mercy / and axe him forgyuenes thereof / with very purpose
and my^de to be confessed thereof at due time / and to take and do penance
therefore. And I dare assure you that this manner of account and reckoning
(though your sin were never so great) shall save you from the ieopardy of
dampnacion / which is no little grace and goodness of god. Thank him than lowly
therefore / and so bless your self / as you did in the morning / and your
bed also / and go thereunto / and so commit your self all hole body and soul
unto the proteccyon / custody and keeping of our lord / who give you good night
and good rest. Amen. It shall be right well also that you call upon such holy
saints as you have special devotion unto / under this form or some other
like. Blessed lady Mary mother of god always vyrgyn / I beseech the pray for me
/ and for all christians. Holy angel of god / what so ever thou be yt art
deputed and appointed unto my custody / I (submyttynge me with most lowly
obedience) beseech the to pray for me / and for all the world. Saint Michael
/ saint Gabryell / saint Raphael / with all holy angels and archangels / I
beseech you pray for me and for all people. Saint John^ baptyst and al holy
patriarchs and prophets I beseech you pray for me and for all chryste^dom.
Saint Peter / saint Paul / saint John^ ye eua^gelyst / and all holy apostles
and euangelystes / I beseech you pray for me and for all ye world / and you
also all dysciples of our lord / and holy Innocents. Saint Stepha^ / and all
holy martyrs. Saint Augustyne / and al holy co^fessours all religious prosones
and heremytes. Saint Katheryne saint Margarete / saint Barbara / and al holy
virgyns / I beseech you pray for me / and for all persons. And finally all
you holy saints of heaven / of every degree and state where you be / I beseech
you all in general / and eueryche in special / pray for me and all mankind.
Here may you bry^ge in ye patrones of your chirches or dioces / and such as
you have (as I said) synguler devotion unto. And here an end as unto your
self. But yet some of you will say. Sir / this work is good for religious
persons / and for such persons as ben solytary and done lie alone by the^
self / but we done lie.ij. or.iij. sometime together / and yet in one chamber
diverse beds and so many in company / if we should use these things in
p^sence of our fellows / some would laugh us to scorn and mock us. O Jesus
bone. O good lord Jesus / what here I now: I dare well say / there ben but few
persons in england but they would bide some danger or rebuke for pleasure of
their king or prince / and many for their master or maystresse / or their
souereyns and some for their fre^des and fellows / and specially where great
gaynes should grow thereby unto the^ self. And for ye pleasure of god our
father / and of our sweet savior Jesus our brother / should we be abashed to
take danger and bear a poor mock or scorn / that never shall wound our
flesh / ne yet tere our skyn for ye pleasure of our pereles pry^ce / king of
ky^ges / and lord of al lords? Fie for shame yt any christian should be so
cowardous Ventre upon it / go forth wtall. Om^e principiu^ difficile. labor
i^broboi^a vincit.
In.ix. days (as they say) ye danger shall be past / fere nothy^ge. Every
begy^nynge is hard and of great difficulte. But importune labor does
vaynquysshe and overcome all things. I tell you / this daily exercise by custum
and use / shall seem very short and sweet / profitable and pleasant. Read it
or here it over ones or twyse at ye leest before they cast it away How be it we
thy^ke it not sufficient nor enough for you to live well your self / but yt
all other christians also live the better for you and by your example / and
specially those that you have in charge and governance / that is to say / your
childer and servants. And me seems it should also be a good pastyme and much
merytoryous / for you yt can read / to gader your neighbors about you on the
holy day / specially the young sort / and read to them this poor lesson. For
therein ben such things as they ben bound to know / or can say / that is /
the Pater noster / the Aue maria / and the Creed / with such other things as
done follow. I would therefore you should begin with them by time in youth as
soon as they can speak. For it is an old saying. Quod nouatesta capit: in
veterata sapit.
The pot or vessel shall ever savor or smell of ye thing wherewith it is
first seasoned. And your englyssh proverb says / yt ye young cock croweth as
he does here and learn of the old. you may in youth teache them what ye will
/ and that shall they le^gest keep and remember. you should therefore above all
things / take heed and care in what company your chylder be^ nourysshed and
brought up. For educacyon and doctrine / yt is to say / bringing up and
learning / done make ye manners / with good and virtuous persons (says the
prophet) you shall be good and virtuous. Psalm. xvij.
And with the evil persons / you shall be also evil. Let your chylder therefore
use and keep good company. The pie / ye say / and other birds done speak what
they most here by ear. The plouer by sight will follow ye gesture and
behauyour of the fowler. And the ape by exercise will work and do as she is
taught / and so will ye dog (by violence) contrary to natural disposicion /
learn to dance The chylder therefore yt by reason done fer excede other
creatures / will bear away what they here spoken / they should therefore be used
unto such company where they should here none evil / but where they may here
godly and chrystyan words. They will also have in their gestures and behauyour
/ such manners as they se and behold in other persons. And as they be^ taught
/ so will they do / and in many things they may be compelled unto a contynuall
custom / which does alter and change natural disposicion. Unto some crafts
or occupacyons a certain age is required in chylder / but virtue and vice may
be learned in eueri age. Se therefore yt in any wise you let them use no company
but good and virtuous. And as soon as they can speak / let them first learn to
serve god / and to say the Pater noster. Aue. and Creed. as I said before. And
not only your chylder / but also se you and prove / that all your servants /
what age so ever they be of / can say ye same. And therefore I have aduysed many
persons / and here now to counsel / that in every mele / dinner or souper /
one person should with loud voice say thus.

First peticyon.
Pater noster qui es incelis: sanctificetur nomen tuu^. Good lord god / our
holy father that art in heaven / let thy name be sanctified / that is to mean /
I beseech the grant us grace to bless / to honor / to laud and praise thy
holy name.

secunde.
Adueniat regnum tuum. Good lord god our father ye art in heaven / let thy
kingdom come / that is / I beseech the lord / that all the people of ye world
may come unto the grace of baptysme / and so be ye feythfull subjects of thy
realm and kingdom of christianite.

third.
Fiat volu^tas tua / sicut in celo et in tra. Good lord god our holy father ye
art in heaven / let thy will be wrought in earth as it is wrought in heaven / that
is to mean / I beseech ye lord / yt all thy chrystyan people here in earth may
perform thy will / and keep thy commandments after their estate and
condition / as thy holy angels and saints done in heaven after their state and
degree.

Panem nostrum cotidianu^ da nobis hodie. fourth.
Good lords god / our holy father that art in heaven / give and grant unto us
this day our daily breed / that is to mean / I beseech the good lord /
grant unto us continually ye spiritual fode / grace and effect of thy holy
sacraments. Or thus. Grant unto us the continual grace and effect of thy
holy sacraments / which is ye daily fode of our souls / and spiritual
suerte of our salvation.

Et dimitte nobis debita nostra: fyfth.
sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. Good lord god our holy father
that art in heaven / forgive us our dettes / as we done forgive our detters / yt
is to mean / I beseech the good lord / forgive and pardon me and all
chrystyans all manner of offenses and trespaces done against the and thy laws /
likewise as we done forgive all manner of persons all manner of greues and
trespaces done against us.

Et ne nos inducas in tentationem. syxth.
Good lord god our holy father that art in heaven / led us not into temptacyon
/ that is to mean / I beseech ye good lord / suffer me not / ne any christyan
/ to be led or brought by any tentacyon / unto the full consent of any sin.

Sed libera nos a malo. seventh.
But good lords god our holy father yt art in heaven / deliver me and all
christians from evil that is to mean / I beseech ye good lord / yt not only
you keep me and al thy people from al syn and offense of thy goodness / but also
yt you wylt deliver and make us quyte of all sy^nes past / and co^serue and keep
us continually in ye state of grace. Ame^. so be it / that is to mean / good
lord we beseech ye that all these things may come to pass in full effect /
according to our peticion and desire. This prayer of ye Pat nr^ / is ye most
excellent prayer / because yt our savior made it himself / and taught it to
his disciples.

The Aue maria / is the most pleasant prayer / and of most honor unto your
blessed lady / because one part thereof is ye salutacyon of the angel Gabryell
/ whereby immedyatly after her consent / she conceived the sone of god in her
womb. Luc. j.
And ye other part / was spoken unto her by saint Elizabeth / inspired and
moved thereunto by ye spirit of god ye holy ghost. And therefore done we set
forth ye Aue maria after such manner as we did ye Pater nr^. Aue maria gr^a
plena dn^s tecu^: bn^dicta tu in mulieribus et bn^dictus fructus ve^tris tui
Jesus. Ame^. Hayle Mary full of grace / god is with the. Blessed be thou among
women / and blessed be the fruit of thy womb Jesus Christ / god and man.
Ame^. so mote it be. That first word Aue / which I do english after ye
common manner / hayle is a word of salutacion / as we say in common
congresses or metynges together. God speed you / god save you / god bless you.
Good morrow good even / god speed / god be at your game / god be at your work
/ god send you / with such other / after ye manner of the country where it is
spoken. And the last word Amen / it is a word of consent or desire / that the
matter spoken before should come to pass / or unto effect / as co^munely it is
said / be it / so be it / let it be so I grant / I assent / with other like.
This have we said / because you should understand what every word means.
Now does follow the Creed.

Saint Peter.
CRedo in deu^ partre^ oi^pote^te^: creatore^ celi and terre. I believe upon god
ye father almighty / maker of heaven and of earth. This term in deum / is
dyuersly englysshed / some done say / into god / some / inwardly in god / some

And I believe perfytly also / that our said lord Jesus after his said passion
and death / descended and went down unto ye low places of hell / and brought

that upon the third day after his death / he did arise from death / and al ye
bonds thereof unto life everlasting.

Carnis resurrectione^. I also believe the resurreccyon of our flesh / that is
to say / I believe that al manner of persons shall arise at the day of dome in
soul and body with the same flesh / blood and bones yt they were borne with

The.xij. article.
Saint Mathye.
Et vita^ eternal. Amen. And also I believe everlasting life / that is to say /
that (after ye general resurreccion) all manner of persons / as well good as
evil / dampened or saved / shall continue in life everlasting / either in joy
or pain / and never depart therfrom. This word Ame^. is declared before in
the end of ye Pater noster. This manner of ye Pater noster / Aue and Creed / I
would have used and read upon the book at every mele / or at the leest ones a
day with loud voice (as I said) that all ye persons present may here it. And
yet forther I would advise and counsel you / to se / know and prove / that
every person in your house / and all that been under your governance and charge
(can say ye same / and therefore you must take the labor to here them your
self / and where need is / to teache them. For many that been aged and can not
say / will be abashed to learn it openly / and yet if they here it daily
read after the manner showed before / they shall by use and custom learn it
very well. And some other persons there ben / that can say right well / both
upon the book and without / but yet among them some ben dullardes and
slouthful / and some negligent and careless / and so done they not say it / but
in time forgete it / as in manner they had never learned it. I pray you therefore
(good devout christians) take the pain to here them your self / at the leest
ones a weke / and let none escape you / old nor young. It shall (believe me) be
unto you a great dyscharge of conscience / and not without merit and great
reward. And charge them straytly under pain of punysshment / that they say it
every day three times at ye leest / that is to say / in the morning / at none
or mydday / and at night. Tha^ must you teache them to know by order the
precepts or commandments of god / the names of the.vij princypal sins /
and of their.v. wits / as thus. First.
The commandments of god ben.x. in no^bre. The first / that we shall have no
strange ne others gods / but one alone / and hy^ to love / honor and dread
above all things. The secu^de we may not take ye name of god in vain / and
therefore we may not use to swear. Secunde Third.
The third / we must keep our holy day with close my^de unto god / and reuere^de
devotion / and therefore we may do no bodily or worldly loboures for lucre
therein. Fourth.
The fourth / we must with reuere^de and due lowly manner do honor unto our
parents / yt is to say unto our fathers and mothers / and we shall have (by ye
promise of god) long life therefore. Fyfth.
The.v. we shall not slay or kill any person / neither in deed / nor yet in
will / or mind / nor yet may we hate any person in heart. i. Io. iii. c.
For who so ever so does / is an homicide and ma^steer. The.vj We may do no
lechery. Syxth. vij. viij. ix. x.
The.vij. we may do no theft. The.viij. we may here no false wytnes / ne make
any ly or lesyng. The.ix. we may not coueyt or desire any wedded or married
person. And ye.x. we may not coueyt ne desire any other man's goods. These
ben ye.x. commandments / given and commanded by almighty god / and they ben
divided in two parts / as two tables or books. Exodus xx.
The first apperteyneth and belongs unto almighty god himself. And in yt
part ben contained ye three first commandments / and all those three
commandments ben contained in this one commandment of the gospel. Love
god above all things. And in the secunde part or secunde table / ben the
other.vij. contained / which done apperteyn and belong unto the neighbor.
And yet all those.vij. ben again contained in this one commandment of
Christ. Love thy neighbor as thy self. Yet may you go forther with them /
sumwhat to teache them what they mean. A declaracyo^ of the said precepts.

The first


For when you say yt we may have no mo gods but one alone / yt is to mean /
that we should love nothing so well as god. Wha^ so ever than a person does
set his heart and my^de upon any creature / more tha^ upon god / so that he
would rather dysplease god and break his laws and ordynau^ces / tha^ for to
leave and forbere the affeccion or pleasure of the creature / tha^ has he a
strange god / an other god / for tha^ yt thy^g is his god / for the which he
does forsake god / and does contrary unto his will and ordinance. And here
(good and devout christians) be well ware / and warn all youres of these
supersticyous wytchcraftes and charms that been much used / and done deceive
many persons / that (for the unlawful love unto the helt he of their bodies /
or of their chylder / or beestes / or other goods lost or stolen) will go seek
wysemen or wysewome^ (for so they done call ye deuyls proctours yt done use
such wytchcraftes and charms) the^ done they seek I say / and put them self
subject unto the false god the devil and his cerimonyes / to get health
unlawfully by the means of that wytchcraftes forbode^ by the church / under
pain of cursynge. And yet the simple people done suppose and wene they do
nothing offend therein. For I have herd them say full often my self. Sir we
mean well / and we dove believe well / and we think it a good and charitable
deed to hele a seek person / or a seek be / and truth they say / but yet
it is neither good ne charytable to heel them by unlawful mean. And surely yt
mean is unlawful. For good reason will admyt / that no sore ne sekenes may be
heeled / but either by nature / or by medicyne / or by miracle. if a finger be
cut / or small surfeit taken / nature in a while will hele the person. But in
all grievous dyseases / medycyne is the commune mean of health / but sure ben
they yt such charms or wytchecraftes ben no medicynes. For tha^ should they
heel as well by one person as by an other. And no man byleueth they ben
miracles / ergo they must nedeli be ye deuyls craft / yt to deceive ye simple
persons / does hurt some / and techeth yt way unlawful to bring them into
his danger. For you will grant yt he were a fool / that for ye health of his
horse leg / would lose one of his own hands / or one of his own eyes / and
yet is he more fool in deed, that for any creature would lose his soul. But
yet some have said to me. Sir / how may this charm be evil or amys / when all
things ben good / as by exemple. The charmer is a good man or a good woman and
takes here a piece of white breed / and says over that breed nothing / but
only ye Pat nr^. and makes a cross upon ye breed / which things ben all
good / tha^ does he nothing else but ley ye piece of breed unto ye tothe yt
aketh / or unto any other sore / turnynge ye cross unto ye sore or disease /
and so is ye person heled. How may this be evil now say they? I say again
it is evil and da^pnable / because ye feyth and believe of ye hole matter
rests in ye applicacion of ye cross / which has no natural operacion /
but is a cerimonye unlawful. For although things here ben good / yet done they
nothy^g avail without yt cerimony / and so is all a charm and unlawful and
naught / which may euydently be known for naught and unlawful / because ye
church does co^de^pne and forbede all such / which thing surely the learned
church of god / gyded ever by the holy ghost would never have done / if it
were good and lawful. And therefore in any wise / let none of your folks use
any such. The secunde.
Now for ye secunde precepte / which is / yt no person should take ye name of
god in vain / warn your folks and took good head unto the^ that they be no
common swerers. For it were less ieopardy for you to have in your house a
thief or a steler / a lecher or unclean liver / than an usual swerer. For a
great oath accustomed / does provoke the sodeyn vengeance of god. The
scripture says. De domo iurantis / non receded plaga. Eccl. xxiii B.
The customable swerer / shall ever be full of iniquyte and sin / and the
plage of ye vengeance of god shall co^tynually hang over that house. Let not
thy mouth be used unto swerynge (says the scripture) For ye customable swerer
shall never be clean purged of sin. Ibidem.
Wherefore I dare well say that swerynge is one of ye great causes of all
these sodeyne plages among me^ and beestes / as pestylence / pockes /
swetynges / and moreyns / with such other. And I believe verily none of you
would be glad to keep in his house a lepre / or any person infected with any of
the foresaid plages. And yet is a swerer more peryllous than any of them. For
his oath may slay or infecte your child in the cradle / or stryke your beestes
in ye feeldes / destroy your corn and graynes / and cause pryuely many
myscheues. And yet many persons done think and believe / that if they swear
troth / they do no sin / but they ben sureli deceived / as by case. if a
person would prynte and coin money of good silver or good gold / keeping also
ye due weight and fasshon / that thing would nothing excuse the person unto
the king or his laws / though also he proved the money were good and lawful
money. For the kings law is / yt no person shall prynt or coin any money
but such as be assigned by him / and that also in the place appointed
thereunto. So in like manner / ye law of god is yt no person shall swear any
oath / except it be at the appointment or commandment of such a person
that has just power to require and to take an oath / and that also must be
done in due place / yt is to say / before a lawful judge. And so may the
person lawfully swear / so ever that the swerer do think and believe in true
and unfeigned conscience / yt his oath is true. And else / yt is to say / without
circu^stau^ces and such other causes expressed in ye law no person may
swear / though it be never so true yt he swereth. if than to swear true be
sin / and does provoke the high displeasure of god / because it is contrary
unto his commandment / to swear falfe must needs be more sin / and more
provoke his vengeau^c. e Example shall I show here of both / that is to say /
how god is provoked by usual swerynge / and how by forswerynge and false oaths
/ this story yt follows I herd at Stondon a little vyllage.xxv. miles from
London / not far from the high way unto Cambrydge / where for a time I did
abide / in auoydyng the great plage that both in London and Cambrydge did than
quyckly and sharply reygne / where also this story was open in ye knowledge of
all the country there about / as done but small time before. A ge^tylman that
was called master Baryngton / whose wife was afterward married in Cambrydge
unto a gentylma^ called master Caryngton / so that there was but one lettre
changed in her name / yt is to say C for B. And of her also I herd the same
story / all though (as she said) she was not present. This said gentylman
Baryngton was a great swerer / and did customably use great oaths / specially
by the blood of our lord / or (as more communly they swear) by gods blood.
And upon a sunday or else a feestfull holy day he went forth on hunting or
hawkynge / and nothing spedynge after his mind he came unto an alehouse at a
through fare called Pulcryche.v. miles from ware in the high way to Cambrydge /
the one side of the which through fare was in ye said parysshe of Stondon /
where this gentylma^ was / and called for drink / and anon he began to swear
after this unhappy custom saying. By gods blood this day is unhappy. And in
a while after in swerynge so / he bledde at the nose / and therewith more vexed
he began to rail and rain god (as they say) in sweryng gods passion /
gods wou^des / gods flesh gods nails / and ever his holy and blessed
blood / till at ye last he fell ferther to blede at the ears / at the eyes /
at his wrestes / and all the joints of his hands and of all his body / at his
nauyll and foundement / and at other places of his body / in meruaylous great
quantyte and stremes of blood / and shotynge out his tongue in a meruaylous
horrible / vgsome and ferefull manner / as black as pytche / so that no person
durst come nere hy^ / but stood aferre of / and cast holy water toward hy^ /
and so he co^tynued ever swerynge / blasphemynge and bledynge / till he expired
and was deed. And on ye morrow after they laid him in a carte / and carried him
unto the said church of Stondon / and ever ye body bled till he was buried in
the way as they came in very great habundaunce. This was a plain token that
god was much displeased with that sweryng / and did openly punysshe the same /
in example unto all usual swerers. It may also be a good monicion and warnyng
for such persons that done mysvse the holy day in hawkynge / hunting / and
such other fruytles occupacyons or pastymes. Another example of the same usual
sweryng was showed unto me by a bachyler of divinity called master George
work / a fellow than where I was also fellow / of ye queen's college in
Cambrydge / and after he was vycar of Harowe on the hill / which thing he
said upon his conscience. He saw himself in a merchants house in London /
which was his special friend / and sent for hy^ to give counsel unto the
same person / a yongman yt was prentyse / or else servant unto ye same
merchant / which yongman did use to swear for his common oath / by the bones
of god or by gods bones. And it came to pass yt he was taken with a great
merueylous sekenes / so yt no physyke ne medicyne could help ne ease him / but
that he lay still in bed so long / that the flesh and the skyn of his
arms and fyngers / and of his legs / thyes / shy^nes / fete and toes / did
diuyde in sondre / as though they had been slyt with a knyfe / so that ye bare
bones might openly be seen and feled. And so in ye same manner (after he had with
great co^tricion and open co^fessyon of that swerynge) received the sacraments
of ye church / he departed this life unto our lord. Here ben now two notable
exe^ples of usual swerynge. The third shall I show you of for sweryng / or
false swery^g / which was showed unto me of an honest priest of my familier
acqueyntau^ce that was vicar of Haly well / where saint Wenefredes well is /
beside ye abbey of Basing work in flynt shyre in ye borders of wales.xiiij.
miles from Westchester / which thy^g he said on his co^scye^ce he did se
himself and was there present with great multitude of other people thousands. A
certain man was called to be sworn in a great matter between two pertyes /
which said parties did put the matter holy unto ye determinacyon of his oath /
and met both at a certain place where was a crucifixe a holy rode that did
many miracles / where upon he should swear / and so did in ye sight and herynge
of a great multitude of people gadred on both parties. And his oath given / he
laid both his hands upon the fete of the rode / and swear false and contrary
unto his conscience / and so was dampnably for sworn / which thing god would
have known. For when he would have taken his hands away to depart / both
the hands cleued and stycked fast unto the sete of ye rode / as though they
had been glued or fastened with nails thereunto. And than he would with violence
have pulled them of / and than with sterynge and hasty mouynge to and fro / the
step whereupon he stood / slypped and voyded from him. And tha^ hanged he
still by his hands / and so remained hanging still contynually the space of
three days / and meruaylous much people came thither to se and look upon him /
of ye which many ben yet living. So at the last after three days when he had
with great contricion openly confessed his defaute / and received ye
sacraments of ye church / wha^ ye people supposed and thought verily he
should there have expired and dyed / he was suddenly losed and delivered / and
lived many years after a good and holy life / unto ye glory of god and great
exemple of them that been swerers. li. ijij. ca. xviij.
Saint Gregory in his dialoges does show of a child / that (as he had herd
of other persons) did swear great oaths / and had pleasure therein / and
suddenly when he was swerynge in his fathers lap upon his knee / the devil came
and openly rauysshed and by vyolence took him from his father / and carried him
away / that he was never seen after. Here may you perceive the great peril
and ieopardy of swerynge. For the love of our lord therefore good devout
christians / take good head thereto / as well in yourselfe as i^ your folks.
And yet should you have no less guard or awayte unto lyenge / or maky^ge of
lies or lesynges For the lie or lesynge is very mother unto both ye defautes
showed last before / that is to say / unto perjury or for swerynge / and unto
false wytnes. For eueryche of these daughters / is worse than the mother.
Mendacium.
For ye liar cares little to bear false wytnes / and every liar is co^munly a
swerer / for else the lie should not be colored / dubbed and peynted
sufficiently to seem treue / and specially in a defaute whereof ye liar would
feign be excused for dread of punysshme^t or rebuke / or wha^ a matter shuldes
(by that lie) come to pass / and be brought about unto effect / for profit
/ auau^tage / flatery or pleasure. For when the liar does coueyte most
subtylly to deceive and would feign and gladly be byleued / than does ye liar
most lyberally lasshe out oaths / and spares for no cost (as they say) but
when such a person does swear most / than will a wise person believe him
leest. And by this does appear / that the common and besy swerers ben suspecte
to be liars. For ye liar is combred so in conscience / that he supposes and
thinks he can not be byleued without he swear many oaths / and great oaths.
Beware therefore of liars / for common liars be^ co^munly thieves or pykers /
and unclean lyuers. And (to say ye troth) ye liar is apt and dysposed unto
all manner of vices / because that all liars ben the chylder of ye devil. For
the devil was the first liar / and ever does co^tynue a liar. Johan. viij. f.
And (as the gospel says) he is the father of all liars. Now ponder and wey
(good devout christians) I pray you / if you were required wheder you would
be content to keep in your company a thief or pyker / a person that should
enforce and labor to corrupt your wives or your daughters / or yet such a
person yt were servant or child unto your deedly foo or enemy / I think you
will say nay / you would keep none such Than say I beware of the liar / for
all common liars ben the deuyls chylder / and done follow their father the
devil / whose properte and natural disposicion is to lie. I can well grant
that you forgive and pardon the^ that done stele / pyke / or do lechery for
ones or twyse / and labor and look for their recovery and amendment / but in
no wise can I grant that you pardon the liars / but even forthwith / as you
would cure ye sodeyn pestyle^ce so correct and punysshe the lie. Wherefore I
have set out here a pretty lesson / which I pray you teache your chylder / and
every child that comes into your company you shall (I trust) do much good
thereby.

if I lie / backbyte / or stele
if I curse / scorn / mock / or swear
if I chyde / fight / strive / or threete
Than am I worthy to be beat
Good mother or maystres mine
if any of these nine
I trespace to your knowing
With a new rod and a fine
Erly naked before I dyne
Amend me with a scourgynge.
And than I pray you fulfill and perform their peticyon and request / and
think it not cruelly / but mercyfully done. Prou. xiii. d.
For the wise man says / who spares the rod hates the child. And in
another place. Eccli. vii. c.
If thou have chylder (says he) correct them be time / and hold them under
while they ben yo^ge / your daily practyse does show unto you / yt if you
powder your flesh while it is new and sweet / it will continue good meet /
but if it smell before it be powdered / all the salt you have shall never make
it seasonable. Powder your chylder therefore be time / and than you love them /
and shall have comfort of them. I did appoint the correccyon before unto the
mother or maystres / for co^munely they done take the labor of that mynysterye
and service. Not withstanding there may be said father or master / and the
staff or foot of ye ryme be all one. But who so ever do the correccyon /
whether it be in lasshes / or in words / let it be done with the charity of
our lord / and with a mylde and soft spirit / that ever it be done for the
reformacion of the person / rather than for the reuengynge of the defaute /
and therefore should you never do any manner of correccion while you ben vexed /
chafed / troubled / wroth / or angry for any cause / but rather for that time
defer the correccyon / and an other time by good deliberacyon take the
persons on part / or if the trespace be openly known / than do it openly /
that all the lokers thereupon may be warned thereby / and give them a good lesson
before the correccyon / and tell them you do the correccyon against your mind
/ compelled thereunto by conscience / and require them to put you no more unto
such labor and pain. For if thou do (say you) you must suffer part of the
pain with me / and therefore you shall now have experience and proof what pain
it is unto us both. And than pay truly / and afterward forth with forgive
them clearly and gentylly / so that they do no more so. And in doing thus
correccyon / you may edify and refourme the persons / and also merit and have
thank of our lord. Where if contrary you chyde / brawle / curse / and with
ungoodly words rebuke / or stryke with hastynes to revenge your own cause or
appetyte / you shall render the persons more stubburne and styffe herted / and
enge^dre in them an hatered toward you. And also not only lose your merit /
but also deserve pain and the punysshment of god / where ye other correccion
done by sobrenes / shall cause the persons to have you in a reuere^de dread /
and also to love you / and here afterward to bless you / and pray for you. I
pray you therefore / win and deserve both their blessing and prayer / and
also the blessing and reward of our lord. But because that co^munly all
persons done use to swear some oath / in affyrmy^ge or denyenge / that is / in
saying ye / as granting / or nay as denyenge / which be^ seldon said
nakedly by them self without some addicion / therefore I would have you in
avoiding of al vain ones / to teache your chylder to make their addicions
under this form. Ye father / nay father: ye mother / nay mother: ye brother /
nay brother: ye sister / nay sister: ye sir / nay sir: ye dame / nay dame: or
unto ye states / master / maystres and so forth of all such common terms /
as grauntfather / grauntmother: godfather / godmother: uncle / aunt / cosyn /
and such like / without any other addicion / or any of these fo^de oaths / as by
cock and pie / by my hode of grene / and such other. Math. v.
For Christ says in the gospel unto his disciples. Swear not you at all (says
he) in any wise / that is to mean / unlawful / or in vain. And the prophet
says. Psalm. lxij
Ladabu^tur oe^s qui iura^t in eo: quia obstructu^ est os loquentium iniqua.
That is / those persons that done lawfully swear in god / shall be praised and
have reward therefore / and the mouth of evil spekers shall be stopped / and
they put to shame and rebuke. All this have we spoken for the keeping of the
secunde precepte or commandment. The.iii. precepte.
Now for ye third commandment. I pray you give good exemple in your own
self / and than teache all youres how they should keep duly ye holy day / yt
is to say (in asmoche as conuenyently may be) to be void of all manner of
worldly and bodyly labors. I said in asmoche as conuenye^tly may be. For
people must have meet and dry^ke / the houses must be appareyled / beestes must
be cured and looked unto. And very unfeigned necessite or need does excuse in
co^scye^ce. The holy day is ordained of god and the church / only for ye
service of god. The due place of that service is the church / unto all them
that may co^uenyently come thereunto. And unto them that may not / every honest
place of good and lawful occupacyon is their church. For god is there present
where he is duly and devoutly served. Take ye pain therefore wha^ you may to
go forth your self / and call your folks to follow. And when you ben at the
church / do nothing else but that you came for / and look often times upon the^
that been under your charge / that all they be occupied / like (at the leest)
unto devout chrystyans. For ye church (as our savior says) is a place of
prayer / not of claterynge and talking. Math. xxj.
And charge them also to keep their sight in the church cloce upon their books
or bedes. And while they ben yo^ge / let them use ever to knele / stand / or
sit / and never to walk in ye church And let them here ye mass quyetly and
devoutly / much part knelynge. But at the gospel / at the preface / and at
the Pat noster. teache them to stand / and to make curtsy at this word Jesus
as the priest does. Thus in the forenoone let the time be spente all in ye
service of god And than in the after noone / must you appoint them their
pastyme with great diligence and strayt commandment. First that in no wise
they use such vanytees as co^munly ben used / that is to say / berebayting
and bulbaytyng / foteball / tenesplayeng / bowlyng / nor these unlawful games
of cardynge / dycynge / closshynge / with such other unthrifty pastymes / or
rather losetymes. Wherein (for a suerte) ye holy day may rather be broken / than
if they went to the plough or carte upon eester day / so it were not done by
co^tempte or despysynge of ye commandment of the law / ne for unreasonable
couetyse and love of worldly goods. For sin does always more defoule and
break the holy day than does any bodyly work or occupacyon. Therefore let them
beware of the tavern and alehous / for dread of dronkennes / or of glotony /
and of suspecte places / or wanton company / for fere of uncleanness / or lechery
which things ben unto youth most peryllous / and of great danger and
ieopardy of corrupcyon. Assygne you therefore and appoint you them ye manner of
their dysportes / honest ever and lawful for a reasonable recreacyon / and (as
much as conuenyently may be) let the sexes be departed in all their dysportes
/ that is to say the kinds / men by them self / and the women by them self.
And also appoint the time or space / that they be not (for any dysportes) from
ye service of god. Appoy^t them also ye place / that you may call or send for
them when case requires. For if there be a sermon any time of the day / let
them be there present all yt ben not occupied in nedeful and lawful busynes /
all other laid on part / let them ever keep the prechynges / rather than the
mass / if (by case) they may not here both. To bye and sell or bargayne upon
the holy day / is unlawful / except it be for very need. Charity unto the
poor and nedy neighbors / does lawfully excuse bodyly or worldly labors
upon ye holy day. Look well you neither do ne say wylfully and by delyberacyon
upon the holy day any thing that you know in conscience / should be contrary
unto the honor of god / and tha^ done you justly keep your holy day. A very
good sure pastyme upon the holy day / is to read / or to here this book / or
such other good english books / and gader thereunto as many persons as you
can. For I tell you there should be no time lost / ne mysspent upon the holy
day. Let this poor lesson now content you for these three commandments of
the first table / which (as I said) done apperteyne and belong unto almighty
god himself. Another short lesson shall we set forth / for the
commandments of the secu^de table. The.iiij. precepte.
And first the due reuere^de honor to be done of the chylder unto ye pare^tes
/ that is to say / unto their fathers and mothers. Teache your chylder therefore
to axe blessing every night / knelynge before they go to rest / under this
form. Father I beseech you of blessing for charity / or thus. Mother I
beseech you of charity give me your blessing. Tha^ let the father or mother
hold up both the hands / and ioynynge them both together / look up
reverently and devoutly unto the heaven / and say thus. Our lord god bless
you child / and therewith make a cross with the right hand over ye child /
saying. In noi^e pr^is et filij et spu^s scti^. Ame^. And if any child be
styffe herted / stubburne / and froward / and will not thus axe blessing / if
it be within age / let it surely be whysked with a good rod / and be
compelled thereunto by force. And if the persons be of forther age / and past
such correccyon / and yet will be obstynate / let them have such sharp and
grievous punysshment as conuenyently may be devised / as to sit at dinner alone
and by them self at a stole in ye myddle of the hall / with only brown breed
and water / and every person by order / to rebuke them as they would rebuke a
these or a traitor. Deuter. xxj. d.
For in ye old law such chylder were brought before ye hole townshyp / that
is to say the people of ye cite / or of that town / and there were they
stoned unto death. And certeynly I would not advise ne counsel any parents /
to keep such a child in their house / without great afflyccyon and punysshment.
And therefore I think it were much convenient for ye pare^tes / often times to
show unto their chylder what co^modytees and profits / and what perils and
ieopardyes done follow the honor and dishonor of the pare^tes / according
unto holy scripture. Eccliastici. iiij. A.
Some whereof I have here set forth as is contained in ye book of the wise man
called Ecclesiasticus / in ye third chapter. Those persons (says he) that been ye chylder of Christ / ben also the chylder of this church / and al such
(as though it were by natural dysposicyon) ben given and applied of that godly
disposicyon unto obedyence and love. All you therefore that been louy^ge chylder
/ be ever obedient unto the judgment and dyscrecion of your pare^tes. And so be
you obedient in all your works / that you thereby may be ye chylder of
salvation / yt is to say / yt your obedience be done with ye very love of your
heart / vnsayned and without dissimulacyo^. For god has ordained yt ye father
shall have due honor among his chylder / and the mother in like manner with
lowly obedyence. Those persons that done love god / will pray unto him for the
forgyuenes of their sy^nes / and afterward will beware conteyne and keep them
self from them. And i^ that daily prayer they shall gracyously be herd. And
like as a person (for the surete of his living here) does horde up and gather
tresour / so done they ordeyn for the suerte of their salvation / that duly
done honor their parents. This word parents does signifye both the father
and mother. Who so ever does duly honor his parents / shall have joy /
pleasure / and conforte among his own chylder. And who so ever is duly
obedyent unto the father / does thereby refresshe and much comfort the
mother. And these persons that done due honor unto their parents / shall
have long life and in the day of their prayer they shall gracyously be herd of
our lord / and have their peticyon. Those persons that have a reverend dread
unto our lord god / have in like manner a reverend dread unto their parents /
and done duly honor them / and will do them such service / and in like manner
as a bond servant should do unto his lord and master / as well in work as
word / with all pacyence and gentylnes. Do therefore unto your parents honor
and reverence / that the blessyng of god may thereby light upon you / and that
blessing shall remain and endure unto your last end. The blessing of the
parents does fyrme and make stable the possessions and the kynred of the
chylder. And contrary / the curse of the pare^tes does eradicate and rote walt
and utterly destroy both. Child / never take thou pleasure ne pride in the
rebuke and dysprayse of thy pare^tes. For that rebuke is not thy glory / boost
nor praise / but rather thy co^fusyon / shame and rebuke. For the glory and
praise of every person / stands in the honor of the parents. And a great
shame and rebuke is it unto the chylder / when the parents ben without honor
and reverence. Good chylder / take good pacyence with the age of your parents
/ and never displease ne grieve them in all your life. Ane they fail in wit or
understanding / and thereafter speak or do any thing contrary unto your reason
or wit / take you pacyence with them / and let the matter pass. And in no
wise do not you despise them / because of our own strength or better abilite.
For the pite and compassion that you have unto your parents / shall never be
forgoten before god. For you shall have good and profit of their offense and
sin. And in ye justice and right you do unto them / shall you be edifyed / and
encreace in virtue. And in ye time of your trybulacyon / that good deed shall be
remembered. For as ye ice in the frost does melte by the clear son beams /
so shall your sins (by your duty done unto your parents) be wasted and
clean losed and forgyuen. That person is of evil name and fame / that does
forsake the pare^tes in their need And those chylder be^ accursed of god / that
done anger vex and trouble their pare^tes. Child of what state or degree so
ever thou be / do ever thy duty with myldnes / mekenes / and lowlynes / and
than shalt thou be well byloued / and praised above other persons. And the
more high estate thou come unto / the more meke and lowly be thou in all
things / and than shall thou in the presence of god have great merit / and
increase in grace. For god does look upon them that done render and give due
thanks / for the favor and goodness done unto them before. Ad verbu^ ferme
tra^slata.
All this now is ye very text and lettre of ye holy scripture in ye place
before rehearsed. Where you may se and perceive many great co^modytes and graces
that done come unto them that duly done honor their pare^tes. And many great
ieopardyes and peryls / and also the curse of god / that does light upon them
that will not do their duty of honor and reverence unto their parents. Let
therefore your chylder use and accustom the^ self / daily to axe their fathers
and mothers blessings. For this dare I say / that all though in case / the
father or mother were an abhomynable sy^ner / or excommunicate / accursed / or
an heretic and though ye child were so also. ex grego. li. dialog. iij. ca.
vij.
Yet might yt cross of the blessing of that father or mother save yt child
from sodeyn myschefe / that else might have come unto that child. And yt cross
may also do flee or chase away evil spyrytes / that else should have had power
upon that child. The blessyng of every good person is good / and not without
great virtue / according unto the power and degree of the persons / and
therefore teache them also to axe blessing of every bishop / abbot / and every
priest / and of their godfathers and godmothers / with other devout persons.
The fyft precepte.
And let this susfyse for this fourth commandment. Yet go forther unto the
fyfth commandment / which is / to kill or slay no person. Teache them there
/ that it is not enough ye they put no person to death by stroke of hand or
wepen / but also that they hurt no person in name or fame by detraccyon /
backbytynge or sclaundrynge / or by evil exemple of living / nor yet that
they curse or ban / or wysshe evil unto any person / or yet hate any person
in heart. j. Iohis iij. c.
For (as scripture says) who so ever does here in heart or mind any hatered /
malice / evil will / or stomach against any chrystian / is an homicide / that
is a mansleer or a manqueller. Many persons will say they ben in charity / and
have no hatered unto any person / and yet will they not speak one unto another
and as it is a sign and token that preuy hatered is in the heart / and that
they do not love their neighbor as them self / in the true and unfeigned
charity of our lord. j. Ioha^. iiij. d.
And sure it is / that who so ever does not holy and fully love his neighbor
/ whom he may se and behold with his bodyly sight / he can never love god /
whom he can not se / nor so behold. This is than the commandment of god /
that who so ever does love god / must also love his neighbor. The.vj.
precepte.
The.vj. commandment is that no lechery be done / which is not meant only
for the unlawful deed / but also for all manner of prouocacyon there unto / as
wanton and light behauyours / in kissing / clepynge / and unclean touching /
a light look or cast of the sight / with a desire and consent of heart unto the
deed / does break this commandment. Much more tha^ does rybauldy break it /
and such manner as before is said. The old proverb says. Who so will none
evil do / should do nothing that longs thereto. The ghostli enemy does
deceive many persons by ye pretense and color of matrimony / in pryuate and
secret contractes. Contractes.
For many men when they can not obteyn their unclean desire of the woman / will
promise marriage / and thereupon make a contracte / promise / and give faith and
troth each unto other / saying. Here I take the margery unto my wife / and
thereto plyght the my troth. And she again unto him in like manner. And after
that done / they suppose they may lawfully use their unclean behauyour / and
sometime the act and deed does follow / unto the great offense of god and their
own souls. It is a great ieopardy therefore to make any such contractes /
specially among them self secretly alone / without records / which must be
two at the leest. For many times / after the unlawful pleasure is past /
discord does fall between the parties / either because that (as the common
proverb says) hot love is soon cold / or else by the means of their
friends / or by some couetyse to have a better marriage they or one of them done
deny the co^tracte / and so unlawfully done mary otherwise / and live in
aduoutry all their life time. And because the church can not openly know that
thing that was spoken and done in priuyte / they be^ thought and supposed so
to live as lawfully in marriage / where in deed before god they done live as
noughty packes in dampnable aduoutri and unlawful lechery / and all their
chylder bastardes before god / all though they seem otherwise unto the world.
Warn therefore your folks there be no such bly^de bargaynes in your house or
governance. The vij. commandment is / do no theft. The.vij. precepte.
Herein correct your young persons be time. For ye child that begins to
pyke at a pyn or a point / will after pyke a penny or a pound. And so go forth
from an apple unto an ox / and from a peer to a purse / or an horse / and so
from ye small things unto the great. When you take any child therefore with
the manner / be it never so little a thing / pay truly at the first time / and
the secu^de time / prycke the py^nes or the points upon the cappe or shulder
in open sight / and let all the house wonder upon them / and cry all / here is
the these / this is ye thief / sese ye thief. And if they mende not thereby /
let them be so brought through the open streets with shame enough / and cruel
punysshment. For better is it that the child weep in youth / and suffer shame
and rebuke / than hereafter the father / mother and fre^des should weep for
sorrow and shame at his hanging and shamfull death. And let every person
beware of theft. For all other sins with contricyon / confession and
penance / may be forgyuen clearly / but theft and all goods valawfully gotten
/ can never be forgyuen unto the time that restitucyon be made / that is to
say / unto the time those goods / or the valor of them be restored / if the
persons (in any wise) may be able thereunto. Let every person than ponder well
and wey / what vauntage it is to stele or pyke / sithe (beside the pain
certeynly to be fuffred in hell or purgatory) the same goods (in valor) must
be restored again. Small goods truly gotten / done grow and encreae unto the
great conforte of the persons. And contrary / evil gotten goods lightly come
(as they say) and lightly go / all waste unto naught / with the dysco^forte of
the parties / and great combraunce of conscience. Se than that all goods be
well gotten among you. The.viij precepte.

The.ix. precepte.


Of the.viij. commandment you have before some remembrance in the lessons of
swerynge and lyenge. The.ix. commandment is / that no person shall desire in
mind nor wysshe / that the wedded make of any other person were lawfully
their wedded make. The.x. precepte.
And the.x. commandment is in like manner of the goods. For so should the
parties have inco^modite / loss / displeasure or disco^forte. The deeds of
these two commandments were forboden of god in the.vj. and.vij.
commandments / here now ben the wylles and desires forboden. That thing
than that no man may lawfully will / may no man do lawfully. Let them therefore
beware that do not only will and desire in mind / but also done secretly /
pryuely / and craftily labor to take their neighbors fermes / or his house
(as they say) over his heed / or to entyce and get away their servants / or
any other goods profitable for the parties. For though such things may seem
unto the world lawful / surely they be not without the great offense of god
/ as contrary unto his commandments. And thus an end of the.x.
commandments. Yet must you have a lesson to teache your folks to beware of
the seven pryncypall sins / which ben co^munly called the.vij. deedly sins
/ but in deed they done call them wrong / for they ben not always deedly
sins. Of ye.vij. pri^cypall sins.
Therefore they should be called capital or princypal sins / and not deedly
sins. These ben their names by order / after our diuisyon. Pride. Envy.
Wrath. Couetyse. Glotony. Slouthe. and lechery. Thus done we order them /
according unto our three ghostly enemies / the devil / the world / and the
flesh. For pride / envy and wrath / done apperteyn and belong unto the
devil / as chief mouer of them. And couetyse does apperteyne unto the world
/ as chief mouer thereof. And glotony / sloth and lechery / done belo^ge unto
the flesh as their chief mouer / which three we done put under this order /
because that glotony is a great occasyon of sloth. For (as the proverb
says) When the belly is full / the bones would have rest. The full fed
gloton is apt unto no good work or labor / but rather al disposed unto
sluggysshnes and sloth. And those two between them done ^yre and provoke most
unto lechery. The.v. wits
Teache them also to know the names of the five wits / and to put the first
finger of the right hand unto ye instruments of ye same wits / that is to
say unto the ear / the eye / the nose / the mouth and tha^ to join and clap
both the hands together / saying thus. Herynge / seeing / smelling / tastynge
/ and touching. The.vij. works of mercy.
It shall be also well done to teache them the.vij. works of mercy / which you
should (after your power) set such in work as you teache them in voice. That is
/ to feed the hu^gry. To give drink unto the thursty. To clothe the naked.
Herborowe or lodge the wayfarynge folks / or them that have need of lodging.
Visit the sick Redeem ye prisoner. And bury the deed. Here is now an end
hereof. A form of confession.
Notwithstanding I think it necessary to show here yet / how you should teache
your folk to be ordered unto ye co^fessyon of these things For I have known
many come unto confession / that could not tell how to do / or what to say
there. I shall therefore set forth here a short form and manner thereof. For
there ben many fourmes of co^fessions in prynt set out at length. First good
devout christians I beseech you give no credence unto these false heretykes /
that done deprave and set naught by confession / nor by this holy sacrament of
penance For I acerteyn you those persons whatsoever they be / that (after
their baptism and chrystendom) have done any deedly sin / can never be in
the state of salvation without the feyth and will of confession. Genes. iij
For almighty god in every law did require co^fessyon / and provoke every
trespacer thereunto / as of our first parents Adam and Eve in paradyse / which
confession if they had mekely made / they and all we should have suffered the
less pain. Leuiti. iiij. et. v.
In the old law special oblacions and sacryfyce was appointed openly by the
priests to be done for such sins among the people that were preuy and
unknown unto al other persons / except only the self trespacers Whereby it
must needs be truth / that they were confessed thereof unto the priests. Wha^
any person also was suspecte of lepry / the judgment and determynacyon thereof
remained (by the ordinance of the law) unto the priest. Which thing was a
plain figure of the sacrament of penance and confession. Math. v.
And our savior said / he come not to break ye law / but rather to
accomplysshe and fulfill the law. Mat. viij Luc. xvij
And so he did confyrme and ratifye that law / when he sent the lepres that he
cured and heeled unto the priests. And in every cure he did upon ye sick
persons / he expressed mystecally confession / in that he caused them to show
their disease before they were cured. Act. v.
And saint Peter his vycar after his ascencyon / did require confession of a
man called Ananye / and of his wife called Saphirye (as appears in holy
scripture) of a deedly sin / which he (by the reuelacyon of god) knew they
had done / and because they would not make confession thereof / they were both
stryken to death with the ve^geau^ce of god. Our mother holy church therefore
has (by the inspiracion of ye holy ghost (ordained that every person ye does
commit or do any deedly sy^ne in work / word / or by full deliberate consent
in thought / must nedely (if they will be saved) be confessed thereof unto a
priest. Sith than all christen people have received and used the same so many
hundred years / take you that use and custom for sufficyent auctorite to
follow ye same and to put all manner of contrary opinion clean out of mind /
and in no wise to here speak or talk thereof. Now unto our matter. First teache
your folks to come reverently unto the ghostly father with meke and sobre
countenance and behauyour (For it is no laughing game) Than knele down at ye
place appointed / and there make a cross upon the foreheed or front / with
Innomine patris (as before is showed) and the^ forth with say thus. Benedicite.
And when the priest has answered / than say (if the person be learned)
Confiteor deo / beat marie / omnibus sanctis / et vobis: peccaui nimis /
cogitatione / locutione / and opere mea culpa. That is to say for the unlearned
/ I confess and knowledge my self gylty unto our lord god / ye blessed lady
saint Marye / unto all the holy company of heaven / and unto you my ghostly
father / that I have offended my lord god many times in my life / and
specially sith ye last time of my confession / in thought / word / and deed /
in many and diverse ways / moo than I can show / specially in the.vij.
pry^cyyall sins. Pride / envy and wrath / couetyse / glotony / sloth and
lechery. And by them I have broken his commandments.

Pride.
For by ye sin of pride I have been presumptuous and disobedient unto god /
and have not loved him above all things / but many times set more by mine own
frail appetyte and sensual desire. For where I should have desired ever ye
laud and praise of our lord / and with all mekenes of heart accused myself / I
have contrary bosted myself / or desired and be^ glad of mine own praise and
ben loath to be dyspraysed. And when I have been challenged / reproved / rebuked
or corrected / or yet charitably ben monysshed and warned of / and for my
defautes / I have rebelled there against / and not mekely received it / but
rather ben ready to defend or to excuse my self / and sometime with a lie / or a
false oath. And for lack of reverend dread and love of our lord / I have by
presumpcion of pride taken his holy name in vain / and unlawfully sworn by
god / by our lady / or the holy saints / by my feyth or troth / with such
other. And for very pride and presumpcyon / and for lack also of love and
dread / I have mysvsed ye holy day in things of pleasure / or profit unto my
self / and not in his service unto his honor. I have also (of high and proud
heart or mind) ben disobedient and not done due honor and reverence unto my
fathers and mothers spiritual and carnal / ghostly and bodyly / nor unto mine
elders and betters / but have been many times full obstynate and froward unto
the^. I cry god mercy. Thus (by this foul sin of pride) I have broken four
of the pry^cypal commandments of our lord / and many other ways have I
also offended therein. I beseech his grace of mercy and forgyuenes.

Envy.
I have also offended my lord god in ye sy^ne of envy for I have not loved my
neighbor as myself / nor be^ so charitably / so ky^de / so loving and
favorable unto all persons / as I would they should have be^ to me / but
rather I have (by suspicion) thought / judged / said or herd of other persons
/ otherwise than I would they should of me nor ben so glad of their wealth / ne
so sorry for their hurt as I would have been of mine own. I cry god mercy.

Wrath.
In wrath also I have offended / for lack of due pacyence / and for light /
sleyght / or small occasyon / have lightly and soon ben styred and moved /
wroth and angry / when any thing has been done or said contrary unto my
mind. And therewith have been ready to revenge the same with forward and
vengeable countenance and behauyour / with high / hasty / and ungoodly words
/ brawling / chydyng / scoldyng / reuylynge / rebukynge / raylyng / vpbraydyng
/ threthyng / cursynge / bannynge / swerynge. And if it came thereunto / in
stryuynge / fighting / or (at the leest in will) (as god forbede) in kyllyng
or sleynge. Thus by these two great sins of envy and wrath I have broken the
fyfth and the.viij. commandment of our lord / and by many other means
offended in them both. I beseech his grace of mercy and forgyuenes.

Couetyse.
In couetyse also I have sinned / because I have not ben content with the
goods / state / and degree of living that god has sent me / where it is much
better than I have deserved / or am worthy / but I have coueyted and desired /
wysshed and wylled / studied and labored to have more (if any be unlawfully
gote^ or so withholden / make plain confession thereof as ye matter requires)
Thus by this sy^ne of couetyse have I broken the seventh commandment of our
lord / and also the tenth / and otherwise dyuersly offended in couetyse. I
beseech his grace of mercy and forgyuenes.

Glotony.
I have also sinned in glotony / in taking meet and dry^ke indiscreetly / and
above that nature did require / and have pyked out and chosen (sometime by
sensual appetyte) the delycate / sweet / and pleasant meets and drynkes /
rather for pleasure tha^ for need / and taken thereof such superfluite (at some
times) that I have been thereby sick or diseased / or at the leest ben ye more
dull both in body and soul / unto all manner of virtue and good exercyses
(Look here whether you have broken any fastes commanded by the law / or ben
drunk / or take any notable surfeit) after mere co^munely I have been more ready
to pass the time in bodyly dysportes and ydlenes / than in labors. I cry god
mercy.

Sloth.
I have been also much slothful and neglygent to serve god / both upon ye
holy day and other days also / and I have been yrke weary / and thought the time
of prayer long / come late thereunto / and make have therein / and oues passed
the service of god / without due reverence / more by course and custom / than by
any good remembrance or devotion / and also I have not ben dilligent to apply
my self unto such bodily labors as I have had in charge / and sometime have
not done the labors at all / or else full sleyghtly done them / and spent ye
time after mine own appetyte full vnfruytfully / sometime in wanto^nesse / and
sometime in very ydlenes. I cry god mercy.

Lechery.
By ye means of these two foul sins of glotony and sloth / I have been the
more ready unto the third sy^ne of ye flesh / that is to say / lechery / for
I have not ben so chaste in soul and body / as ye state / degree and manner of my
living does require / not so dilligent and ready to put away unclean thoughts or
mocyons of ye body as I should be / but rather followed them at somtymes will
fully / and suffered them to hang upon me / and take in them delectacyon and
pleasure for the time. And when I have be^ in presence of company / I have not
always ordered my self in chaste manner / in my lokes or syghtes / countenance
and behauyour / words and deeds / but many times have been fullyght to take or
to give occasyon. I cry god mercy. Here must you remember suit or prouocacyon
unto uncleanness / done or suffered on your behalf / as in words / wrytynges /
signs / tokens / messages / kissing / clepynge / touching / or other more
fylthy aid unlawful behauyour / done in deed or in full co^sente. And so show
every thing with the due circu^staunces / of ye time / place / and persons /
not namynge the persons / but showing the states or degrees of them / as
whether they be married or unmarried etc^. Thus by this foul sin of lechery /
have I broken the.vi. and also the.ix. commandment of god / and by many other
means / as well in this sin as in all the other of these.viij. princypall
sy^nes / have I grievously offended my lord god / broken his commandments /
not fulfilled the works of mercy unto my power / and mysvsed my five wits /
in herynge / seeing / smelling / tastynge / and touching. For the which and
for all other / as our lord knows me gylty / and I would confess and
knowledge if they came to mind / I beseech his gracyous goodness of mercy and
forgyuenes. And you my ghostly father of penance and absolucyon. Et precor
sancta^ mariam / omnes sanctos dei / et vos orare pro me. Which is to mean
unto the unlearned. And I beseech the blessed lady saint Marye / all the holy
company of heaven / and you also my ghostly father to pray for me. And when you
have taken your penance / and have been assoyled / than say you unto the
priest. Sir / and it please you / this is my penance / and than rehearse the
same ones or twyse your self / that you may the more surely here it in mind.
For I assure you / it is ieoperdous (after learned men) to forgete the penance.
And thus an end hereof. Yet did I promise in the beginning / to set forth
here a forther exercise / which I think should be good and profitable for all
persons For the common proverb is / that a great benefyte or gift is worse
than lost upon such vnky^de persons that done not remember it / ne give but
thanks therefore. It should become therefore every feythful christian to have
ever in mind the great and excellent benefit of our salvation. And therefore
have I devised here a short table / that does (in some) conteyne the hole
life of our savior Jesus / that such persons as will can it by heart / and
have it ready in my^de / may lightly order and lay up as it were tresour in a
chest or cofre / al such matters of the gospel / and that done apperteyne unto
ye acts of our savior / as ben preched where they ben present / or that they
done here in any good co^munycacyon or redynges. And also over this / they
shall have two great profytes hereby / one is / yt no remedy may better ne
sooner chase away all tentacyons / and put the ghostly enemies to flight /
than this remembrance. The secunde is / that nothing in this world may
rather ne more spedefully move a dull heart unto devotion and unto the
co^tynuaunce of virtue / than this exercise. I beseech you all therefore / in
visceribus Jesus xp^i. that is to say / for the tender love of our lord god
and most sweet savior Jesus / give some labor and dilyge^ce thereunto / and
daily use the same. It is but short and therefore may it soon be had by heart.
And it is very sweet / pleasant and profitable / and therefore should be
received with good will and diligence.

Now you may se this table is not long / but may easily be had by heart / and
if it so be / and daily used / I dare well say the persons shall find
comfort therein / both to exclude vice / and also to encreace i^ virtue and
grace. And yet furthermore to continue therein unto their conforte and joy
everlasting / whereunto he bry^ge us that bought us / our lord god and most
sweet savior Jesus / who gyde you and keep you all. Amen.

A breue / or short monicyon or counseyle of the cure and governance of a
household / according unto policye / taken out of a pystle of a great learned
man / called Bernarde syluestre / and put among the works of saint Bernarde /
for because ye many done judge and think it was his own work. Set forth by
the same brother.
First good devout christians / take most head / and give most diligence to
order yourselfe / and all youres / unto our lord / according unto the poor
lesson that goth before / and than se well unto the substance / and gydyng of
your house / and goods. Se first that peace be in the house / and that you
agree all together / for else all your goods will soon go to naught. Than (after
the common proverb) cut your thonges: after / or according unto your ledder.
Spend according unto your gaynes / gettings or re^tes / and not above. It is
also good policye: to have one years rent / or an years gaynes in store for
chances / which is not contrary unto christianite: where extreme / or verey
street need: is not perceived in the neighbor. A neglygent or rechles person
may soon set on fine / and destroy great substance. Have therefore a good eye
/ and guard unto the diligence of your servants / for under them your goods
may soon mynysshe / and be wasted before you know / beware / or have knowledge
thereof. If your goods begin to wast: better is / and less rebuke sor you to
absteyne / and withdraw your charges: than to fall into nedynes / or danger.
An old proverb. Qui plus expendit quam rerum copia tendit. Non admiretur si
pau pertate grauetur. That is.

Who so done spend behonde their faculte
No marvel though with need they grieved be.
It is therefore a great providence / and good foresyght often to count / and
compare your goods / and your gaynes with your expe^ses. Often to ouerse your
goods: shall be necessary. For your beestes may take hurt for defaute of fode
(all though they nothing axe) ne compain. The sleep of ye housba^de: Aristo.
in economie
makes a fat dong hill. And the eye of the master: a fast horse. That is to
mean / that ye presence of the master: in every corner: is much profitable.
Sumptuous and costly weddynges or brydales: ben damage / without honor.
Expenses done upon war: ben more honorable: tha^ profitable. Better is to
suffer some wrong / and to bye peace than to make war / or to keep war.
Cost made upon prodigal persons: is clearly lost. Cost made upon ky^ne /
or fre^des: is reasonable. Feed your household servants: with honest common
fare / with out delicates. For the servant that is made a gloton / shall never
after mende his manners. Glotony is vile / fylthy / and stynkynge / and will
make the neglygent and careless person soon rote^ and short lived. Ecclesia.
xxxj.
Mean fedynge with scarcyte: is unto the dylygent person: pleasant and
profitable. Upon the holidays and high festes: give your household plenty of
meet: but seldom and few delicates. For the use of delycate fode / will soon
mar a good servant. Let glotony and thy purs strive / and go to law
together: and beware thou well / which part thou take / but for ye most
part always hold with the purs. For glotonous men of law and the wytnesers:
done speak all of affection / but ye purs brings in plain euyde^ce and proof
/ the empty barn and the empty bag. But if very nygardy shut up thy purs /
tha^ art not thou an eue^ judge. For nygardy is a folysshe and nedeles feere /
and ever living in pouerte / and hurdeth and muckereth up: he can not tell for
whom. If you have plenty of corn: desire no derth For those persons that of
covetous mind done procure or desire derthe / done procure and desire ye death
of the pore / and shall be accused: as homicides and man sleers. Sell thy corn
better chepe unto thy neyghbur (although he were thyn enemy) tha^ unto
strangers. For an enemy is sometime sooner vainquysshed and over comen by a
kind deed / than by the sword. Be never at debate with thy neyghbur / but
rather study / and labor to be at one. Eccl. s. b.
For thou can have none so sure a castle / or guard of thy life: as is love
and frendshyp of thy neyghburs: If you suspecte the women of thy house: let
other persons rather show the / than thou should be over busy to try out the
matter. For though it were of thyn own wife / or the wife of thy husband: it
were better unknown. For ones known / it is never cured / the wound is
without remedy / If any remedy be: it shall be when like chance is herd of
other persons. The lest and most easy way therein: is to dissimule the matter
though it were pryuely known / and pretend ygnoraunce without any quarrel or
countenance / but rather by a dyscrete ghostly father let the parties be
reformed that sin be not co^tynued. A noble heart / and high gentle mind:
will never search of women's matters. A shrewe will sooner be corrected by
smiling or laughy^ge: than by a staff / or strokes. The best way to keep a
woman good: is gentle entreaty / and never to let her know that she is
suspected / and ever to be cou^seyled and informed with loving manner. An old
woman unclean of living (if the law would suffer) should be buried quycke. Of
array.
Let your clothy^ge or array / be in a mean / another vile ne precious / but
always feyre and honest / and of sad / and not of wanton fasshyon. A costly
garment byhonde: or above the state and degree of the person: is a sign and
token of little wit. For a woman that has sufficient array: to desire new /
and change: is a sign of little sadness. Trust him rather for thy friend / that
somewhat does for the: than him that does offer him self: saying. I am youres
in all I can and may. For in words is great plente of friends. Prouer. xvij.
c. Eccl. s. b.
A true friend loves at all times / and never feyleth: at nedr. There is no
comparyson of riches: unto a feythfull friend. Never repute / ne think him thy
friend: that does praise / or boste the unto thy face / or in thy presence.
When you give counseyle unto a friend: say this seems best unto me / not thus
you must nedeli do. For you may sooner get rebuke / or blame for your counsel if
it prove not: tha^ thank for your good counsel: though it speed well. If
my^strelles / iogulers / or gesters come unto thy house: say thou have no
lodgy^g for such gesters / you keep nether ynne nor alestake. For if you take
pleasure i^ their pastymes you ben full like to have another wife shortly after
/ whose name is called pouerte / or beggry. If you fortune to come where they
ben / and begin somewhat to delecte in their matters: I advise you dissimule and
take upon you yt you herd the^ not / ne set any thing thereby. For if they
perceive and se you but laugh: they will take yt for an ernest to cry largess
/ and to have reward. And so importune will they be / and so shamfully crave:
yt you shall be yrke and weary of the^ / and peraue^ture they will fall to
rebuky^ge / braulyng / and scoldyng / so yt you shall be feign / and glad: to
give somewhat for fere unto those galowe clapers worthy in deed to be hanged up.
For I tell you / god is not pleased with yt occupacyon / except it be (as scant
tolerable or alowable) among pry^ces / lords / and high astates Now for your
servants / if you have a servant of high proud mind and stubburne stomach
put him away lest after he do you harm / and so do him yt always does praise
your manners in all things. For a flaterer is worse than an enemy. Your enemy
can not lightly deceive you / but your servants or your neighbors that done
praise you: ben surely about to deceive you. If you have a bashful and dredful
servant and find hy^ feythful / tha^ love him and cherysshe him as your own
natural child. Make your byldynges rather for need than for pleasure. For the
appetyte of byldynge for pleasure shall never have end / till pouerte teache
wit somewhat to late. Be loathe to sell your heritage / and if you must need /
sell. Sell not unto great persons / but rather for less unto ye lower
persons. Better is to sell tha^ to borowe by usury. For usury is like a thief
yt would warn you before what harm he would do unto you. If you bye or
bargayne / be not buty fellow with great persons. And though he be under you /
yet strive not with him lest he put his part unto your better / or master.
In all things keep truly and feythfully your bond and promise / according
unto your couenaunte. Due temperau^ce is a thing of great honestye in a
household / let therefore your drink wine / ale / or bear be temperate. Strong
drink is more pleasant / than wholesome. Ecclesia. xxxj. d. Ibidem.
The wise man says / that sobre drink is the health both of soul and body.
And the wise and learned person will be right well content with little drink /
and that shall not trouble the stomach / but rather cause sweet and wholesome
sleep / and of the contrary done come many inco^modites as there does follow.
Who so ever among many and diverse strong drynkes / with abundau^ce thereof: is
sobre / may be called an erthly god / or a god upon earth / wrestle not
therewith if you do my counsel. And if by chance you be in company / and begin
to feel the drink work: arise / and depart / a sleep is more meite for you /
than any company. Who so by words would excuse dro^kenes: does openly declare
his own disease. The knowledge and judgment of wynes: does nothing become a
young person. If a physicyon or surgyon use to be drunk / let him not have ye
cure of your disease / ne let none of them take experyence / and learn in you:
how to cure / or hele another. For though they be well learned / and have not
experyence / it is no wisdom to let them prove their conyng upon you. Great
gay horses / and little pretty dogs: leave you unto lords and ladies. A bygge
labourynge horse / and a mastyfe / or a curre dog: ben good to keep your
house. As for hawks / hounds / and hunting dogs: done spend more than
they done get / they ben miete and according for states: to set idle
servants on work / but far vnacordynge ben they: for housbandes and ware
householders. It is no wisdom to make your own chylder stewardes or rulers of
your household or goods. Fools and neglygent or careless persons: have many
mysfortunes. For that is their commune excuse when any thing is wrong / they
say than: yt chance or mysfortune was cause thereof. I say not nay: but yt
chance / or mysfortune may fall. But who so does follow wisdom / learning /
and dyscrecyon: shall seldom accuse mysfortune. For diligence / warenes / and
good head: done seldom company with mysfortune. But yet more seldom shall you
se mysfortune and slouthe or negligence: departed in sondre / for they done
communely company togeder. The sluggarde says: god will help him / and so
tongue he trusts there unto: Pro. vi.
till he be brouhht unto beggry. For god by the wise man does send the
sluggarde (for exemple) unto ye ant or pysinpre / to learn to labor. For man
(says Job) is borne unto labor: Job. v.
as a byrd to fly. Keep you (therefore) but few idle persons or me^. And
watch you / and take good head unto every person of your house. And ever
pondre / wey / and consydre your expenses: with your gaynes / or gettings.
First get / and bring in / and than spend. For it is no good husbandry to
borowe. And wha^ you wex aged: trust rather unto god tha^ unto your chylder /
or friends. That you send before you: you shall be sure to find. No cofre /
chyst / ne tower may be more sure to keep tresure: than is heaven. Let not
(therefore) ye poor pass you. What you give unto them: you give unto christ.
And of yt you leave behind you: appoint it unto every person his part. For
better were for you nothing to leave: than that strife and debate should be
made / conscience blemysshed / and god offended for your goods. Trust them
best to do for your soul: not that done love / or say they done love your
soul: but that you done perceive / and conjecture: done love their own soul.
Make your testament every year new / and surely sealed by wytnes. Lay it where
(when need is) it may be found no man is sure how to end his life. The most
sure way: to dye well / is well to live. Which he grant us that bought us /
our lord god / and most sweet savior Jesus christ. Ame^. Of your charity pray
for the same old wretch of Syon
