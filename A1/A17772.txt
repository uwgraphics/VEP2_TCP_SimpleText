such persons as contemn authority.
Concerning suspected persons, houses, and watchmen.
III That all searchers, examiners, or overseers; all constables,
churchwardens, and overseers of the poor in this Town, do from time to time
make enquiry after such persons as are sick in their parishes, and of what
diseases; and in case that it be apparent, or suspected to be of the plague,
that they acquaint the chief examiner or overseer with it, and presently
restrain access unto suspected houses, and persons, until it appear what the
disease will prove: and if it prove the infection, that the house be shut up,
and well watched night and day. IIII That if any infected household be suffered
to stay in the Town after the infection is known, that there be two watchmen
appointed, one for the night, the other for the day; and that the watchmen be
very careful that no persons go in or out of such infected houses, whereof
they have charge, upon pain of severe punishment; and that such watchmen do
such offices, and provide, and fetch such necessaries for the persons in the
houses infected as they have need of, and require; and that the watchmen
appointed for the day ward until eight of the clock at night, and the watchmen
for the night, until six of the clock in the morning; the one not to depart
till the other come. V That the master, mistress, or dame of every house or
family, so soon as any in the same falls sick of any disease, or complains
either of botch, purple, or swelling, shall give knowledge thereof to the
searchers or examiners within two hours after the person is sick, and suffer
no persons to enter into the house without order from them, or one of them. VI
That so soon as it shall appear to the searcher or examiner that any person in
a house or family is sick of the plague, the sick and the whole shall be
sequestered in the same house, if it be possible, one from the other, and so
continue with one person to attend the sick; and though the sick die not, the
whole household shall be removed, if conveniently it may be, or shut up, and the
house well aired, for six weeks at the least before the persons in it be set at
liberty. And if any person shall have visited, or accompanied any man known to
be infected of the plague, or willingly entered into any known infected house,
the house wherein he inhabiteth shall be shut up for so many days as the
Court, or examiner shall think fit. VII That the burial of the dead by this
visitation be always either before sunrising, or after sunsetting with the
privity of the examiners, or overseers, or churchwardens, and constables of the
parish; and that no neighbors or friends be suffered to accompany the corpse to
Church, or to enter, or come near the house visited, or to stand gazing in the
streets as the corse is carried to burial, or in burying, but only those of
the same house, and buriers. VIII That no clothes, apparel, bedding, linen,
woollen, or other stuff whatsoever, be suffered to be conveyed, or carried out
of any infected houses; and that all pawning, buying, or receiving of any
clothes, apparel, bedding, linen, woollen, and other housholdstuffe whatsoever,
be utterly forborne by all persons whatsoever; And if any person shall be found
to offend herein, his name to be presented to the Court. IX That if any person
infected or suspected to be infected, shall come or be conveyed from a place
infected to another place; the parish whence such party is come or conveyed,
shall cause the person visited, and so escaped, to be brought back again by
night; and the parties in this case offending, or consenting thereunto, to be
punished at the discretion of the Vicechancellour, and Mayor, and their
Assistants; and the house of the receiver of such visited person to be shut up
twenty days at the least. X That every house visited be marked with a red
cross in the midst of the door a foot long, evident to be seen, there to
continue until lawful enlargement of the same house. XI That those which
watch or keep the visited be not suffered to pass the streets, without a red
rod of three foot in length in their hands held up evident to be seen, and not
to come into the markets, or other houses then their own, nor to receive any
money but in water, or goods from the house or persons they watch, and to
abstain from company, especially when they have been used in attending the
visited. XII Whereas for the better preservation of the Countrey-people, and
inhabitants of this Town, there are certain persons appointed to buy provision
for the persons infected or suspected, that those persons which do daily attend
the markets in their several courses do keep out all such as dwell near the
infected, and do buy such provision and other necessaries as they are entreated
by the watchmen, and the same deliver unto the watchmen at the places appointed
on the outsides of the Town, and not suffer any watchman, or other person
dwelling in suspected places to come into the Town or market, to fear or
endanger the Countrey-people that come to sell.
Concerning public assemblies.
XIII That all public assemblies at burials of the dead, christenings,
marriages, and churchings, and visitation of the sick, be as much forborne as
possibly may be, and no person admitted into the house where any infected or
suspected persons are, and that upon no occasion there be suffered any flocking
or thronging of people together, nor any begging in the streets, lanes, or back
ways in or about the Town: And if any happen, that the watchmen,
churchwardens, overseers, or constables present their names to the
Vicechancellour and Mayor in the Court every Monday and Thursday, and of those
that give occasion of the same.
