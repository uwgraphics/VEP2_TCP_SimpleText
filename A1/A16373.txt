THe Marshall and the vssher must know all the estates of the church and the
high estate of a king with the blood royal.

The estate of a Pope has no pere. The estate of an Emperor is next. The
estate of a king. The estate of a cardynall The estate of a kings sone a
prince. The estate of an archebysshop. The estate of a duke The estate of a
bishop The estate of a marquis The estat of an earl The estate of a vycount

Vycou^tes all these these may sit two at a mess. A baron and the mayre of
London and three thief Iuges and the speker of the parlyament and an abbot with
a myter all these may sit two or three at a mess And all other estates may sit
three or four at a mess Also the Marshall must understand and know the
blood royal for some lord is of blood royal and of small lyuelode. And some
knight is wedded to a lady of royal blood she shall keep the estate that she was
before. And a lady of lower degree shall keep the estate of her lords blood /
and therefore the royal blood shall have the reverence as I have showed you
here before. Also a marshall must take heed of the birth and next of the
line of the blood royal. Also he must take heed of the kings officers of the
Chaunceler Steward Chamberlayne Tresourer and Controller. Also the marshall
must take heed unto strangers and put them to worship and reverence for and
they have good chere it is your soueraynes honor. Also a Marshall must take heed if the king send to your sovereign any message and if he send a knight
receive him as a baron. and if he send a squyre receive him as a knight / and
if he send you a yoman receive him as a squire / and if he send you a grome
recerue him as a yoman. Also it is no rebuke to a knight to set a grome of
the king at his table.
Here ends the book of service and keruynge and sewynge and all manner of
office in his kind unto a prince or any other estate and all the feestes in
the year.
