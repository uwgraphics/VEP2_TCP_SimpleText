The Story of David and Berseba. To a pleasant new tune.


When David in Jerusalem,
as royal King did rule and reign,
Behold what happened unto him,
that afterward procured his pain.
On the top of (...) his Princely (...).

Her beauty was (...) excellent
and brighter than the morning Sun,
By which the King incontinent,
was to her favor quickly won.
She stood within a pleasant Bower,
all naked for to wash her there,
Her body like a Lilly Flower,
was covered with her golden hair.
The King was wounded with her love,
and what she was he did enquire,
He could not his affection move,
he had to her such great desire.
She is (...) Wife, quoth they,
a Captain of your Princely Train,
That in your Wars is now away,
(...) (...) does all alone remain.
Then said the King, Bring her to me,
for with her love my heart is slain:
The Prince of beauty sure is she,
for whom I do great grief sustain.
The Servants they did soon prepare,
to do the message of the King,
And Berseba the Lady fair,
unto the Court did quickly bring.
The King rejoiced at her sight,
and won her love, and lay her by,
Till they in sport had spent the night,
and that the Sun was risen high.
The King his leave most kindly took
of the fair Lady at the last:
And homeward then she cast her look,
till that three months were gone and past.
And then in Berseba so fair,
she found her former health exilde,
By certain tokens that she saw,
the King had gotten her with child.
Then to the King she made her moan,
and told him how the case did stand:
The King sent for her Husband home,
to cloak the matter out of hand.
When from the Camp Vriah came,
the King received him courteously,
Demanding how all things did frame
concerning of the Enemy.
Vriah showed his Highness all
the accident of warlike strife.
Then said the King, this night you shall
keep company with your own wife.
The Ark of God ( Vriah said)
with Judah's Host, and Israel,
Keep in the Field, and not a man
within the house where they do dwell.
Then should I take my ease, quoth he,
in beds of Down with my fair wife?
O King, he said, that must not be,
so long as I enjoy my life.
Then did the King a Letter frame,
to Ioab General of the Host,
And by Vriah sent the same,
but certainly his life it cost.
The second part, To the same tune.


ANd when the King for certain knew
Vriah thus had murdered been,
Fair Berseba to Court he drew,
and made of her his royal Queen.
Then God that saw his wicked deed,
was angry at King David's sin:
The Prophet Nathan then with speed,
came thus complaining unto him.
O David, ponder what I say,
a great abuse I shall thee tell:
For thou that rul'st in equity,
should see the people ruled well.
Two men within the City dwell,
the one is rich, the other poor:
The rich in Cattle does excel,
the other nothing has in store,
Saving one silly little Sheep,
which young he did with money buy:
With his own bread he did it feed,
amongst his Children tenderly.
The rich man had a stranger came
unto his house that loved him dear,
The poor man's Sheep therefore he took,
and thereof made his friend good cheer.
Because that he his own would save,
he used the man thus cruelly:
Then by the Lord the King did swear,
the rich man for that fault should die.
Thou art the man, the Prophet said,
thy Princely Crown God gave to thee:
Thy Lords wives thou thine own have made,
and many more of fair beauty.
Why have thou so defilde thy life,
and slain Vriah with the sword,
And taken home his wedded Wife,
regarding not Gods holy Word?
Therefore behold, thus says the Lord,
great wars upon thy house shall be,
Because thou have my Laws abhord,
much ill be sure Jle raise on thee.
I Will take thy wives before thy face,
and give them to thy neighbors use:
And thou thereby shall have disgrace,
for men shall laugh at thine abuse.
Then David cried out pittiously,
sore have I sinned against the Lord,
Have mercy God therefore on me,
let not my prayers be abhorred.
But as the Prophet told to him,
so did it after chance indeed.
For God did greatly plague his sin,
as in the Bible you may read.
The scourge of sin thus you may see,
for murder and adultery.
Lord grant that we may warned be,
such crying sins to shun and (...).
