Here begins a litell treatise of the Knight of Curtesy and the lady of
Faguell. a man and a lady, accompanied by another lady, in courtly dress

IN Faguell a fair country
A great lord sometime did dwell
Which had a lady so fair and fre
That all men good of her did tell
Fair and pleasant she was in sight
Gentyl and amyable in each degree
Chaste to her lord both day and night
As is the turtyll upon the tree
All men her loved both young and old
For her virtue and gentylnesse
Also in that land was a knight bold
Right wise and full of doughtinesse
All men spoke of his hardynesse
Rich and poor of each degree
So that they called him doutlesse
The noble knight of curtesy
This knight so curtesy was and bold
That the lord herd there of anon
He said that speak with him he would
For him the messengere is gone
With a letter unto this knight
And said sir I pray god you se
My lord of Faguell you sends right
An hundred fold gretynge by me
He prays you in all hastynge
To come in his court for to dwell
And ye shall lake no manner of thing
As towns towers and many a castle
The curteyse knight was sone content
And in all dilygence that might be
With the messyngere anon he went
This lord to serve with humylite
Fast they rode both day and night
Till he unto the lord was come
And when the lord of him had a sight
Right friendly he did him welcome
He gave him towenes castelles and towers
Whereof all other had envy
They thought to reave him his honors
By some treason or treachery
This lady of whom I spoke before
Seeing this knight so good and kind
Before all men that ever were bore
She set on him her heart and mind
His paramour she thought to be
Him for to love with heart and mind
Not in vice but in chastyte
As children that together are kind
This knight also curteyse and wise
With heart and mind both ferme and fast
Louyd this lady wythouten vyse
Which till they dyed did ever last
Both night and day these lovers true
Suffered great pain woe and greuaunce
How each to other their mind might show
Till at the last by a sudden chance
This knight was in a garden grene
And thus began him to complain
Alas he said With murnynge eyes
Now is my heart in woe and pain
From mourning can I not refrain
This ladies love does me so wound
I fear she has of me disdain
with that he fell down to the ground
The lady in a wyndowe lay
With heart cold as any stone
She wist not what to do nor say
When she herd the knights moan
Sore sighed that lady of renown
In her face was no color found
Than into the gardein came she down
And saw this knight lie on the ground
when she saw him lie so for her sake
Her here (...) was almoost gone
To her (...) could she none take
But in swo^^ fell down him upon
So sadly that the knight awoke
And when that he saw her so nere
To him comfort anon he took
And began the lady for to chere
He said lady and love alas
In to this cure who has you brought
She said my love and my solas
Your beauty stands so in my thought
That if I had no worldly make
Never none should have my heart but ye
The kynght said lady for your sake
I shall you love in chastyte
Our love he said shall be none other
But chaste and true as is between
A goodly sister and a brother
For lust our bodies to keep clean
And where so ever mi body be
Both day and night at every tide
My simpele heart in chastity
Shall ever more lady with you abide
This lady white as any flower
Replete with feminine shamefastness
Begayn to change her face color
And to him said my love doubtelesse
Under such form I shall you love
With faithful heart in chastity
Next unto god that is above
Both in welthe and aduersyte
Each of them kyssed other truly
But ever alas there was a fo
Behind the wall them to espy
Which after turned them to much woe
Out of the gardyn when they were gone
Each from other did depart
Away was all their woeful moan
The one had lyghted the others heart
Than this spy of whom I told
Which stood behind the garden wall
Went unto his lord full bold
And said sir show you I shall
By your gardyn as I was walking
I herd the knight of curtesye
which with your lady was talkinge
Of love unlawful pryuely
Therefore if ye suffer him for to proceed
With your lady to have his love
He shall be led fro you in deed
Or else they both shall you distroye
When than the lord had understand
The words that the spy him told
He swear he would rydde him fro that
Where he never so strong and bold
He swear an oath by god almyght
That he should never be glade certain
While that knighe was in his sight
Till that he by some mean were slain
Than let he do cry a feast
For every man that thider would come
For every man both most and leest
Thither came lords both old and young
The lord was at the table set
And his lady by him that tide
The knight of curtesy anon was set
And set down on the other side
Their hearts should have be woe begone
If they had known the lords thought
But when that they were still echone
The lord these words anon forth brought
My think it is syttinge for a knight
For auentures to inquire
And not thus both day and night
At home to soiourne by the fire
Therefore sir knight of curtesye
This thing will I you counseyll
To ride and go throught the country
To seek adventures for your avail
As unto rodes for to fight
The christen faith for to maintain
To show by arms your force and might
In Lumbardy, Portyngale and in Spain
Than spoke the knight to the lord anon
For your sake will I adventure my life
Whether ever I come against or none
And for me ladies sake your wife
If I did not I were to blame
Than sighed the lady with that word
In dolor deep her hirte was taken
And sore wounded as with a sword
Than after dyuer the knight did go
His horse and harneyse to make ready
The woeful lady came him unto
And to him said right pyteously
Alas if ye go I must complain
Alone as a woeful creature
If that ye be in battle slain
On live may I not endure
Alas unhappy creature
Where shall I go where shall I bide
Of death sothely now am I sure
And all worldly joy I shall set a side
A pair of sheres than did she take
And cut of her here both yelowe and bright
Were this than said she for my sake
Upon your helm much cutuyse knighe
I shall dear lady for your sake
This knight said with still morninge
No comfort to him could he take
Nor abstain him fro perfounde syghinge
For great pity I can not write
The sorrow that was between them two
Also I have to small respyte
For to declare their pain and woe
The woeful departinge and complaynt
That was between these lovers twain
Was never man that could detaynt
So woeful did they complain
The teres ran from their eyes twain
For doloure when they did depart
The lady in her castle did remain
With langour replenysshed was her heart
Now leave we here this lady bright
Within her castle making her move
And turn we to the curteys knight
Which on his Journey forth is gone
Unto himself this knight said he
Against the christen I will not fight
But to the rodes will I go
Them to sustain with all my might
Than did he her here unfold
And one his helm it set on hye
With read thredes of rich gold
Which he had of his lady
Full richely his shield was wrought
With asure stones and beten gold
But on his lady was his tohught
The yelo we hear when he did behold
Than forth he rode by dale and down
After auentures to inquire.
By many a castle cite and town
All to batayl was his desire
^ In every Iustyng where he came
None so good as he was found
In every place the price he wan
And smote his adversaries to the ground
So when he came to Lumberdye
There was a dragon there about
Which did great hurt and vylanye
Both man and best of him had doubt
As this knight rode there alone
Save only his page by his side
For his lady he began to moan
Sore syghynge as he did ride
Alas he said my lady sweet
God wot in what case ye be
God wot when we two shall mete
I fear that I shall never you se
Than as he looked him a boute
Toward a hill that was so hye
Of this dragon he hard a shoute
Yonder is a feast he said truly
The knight him blessed and forth did go
And said I shall do my travail
Betyde me well betyde me woe
The ^^ers find I shall assail
Than with the dragon did he meat
When she him saw she gaped wide
He took good head as ye may wete
And quyckely sterted a little a side
He drew his sword like a knight
This dragon fyersly to assail
He gave her strokes full of might
Strong and mortal was the battle
The dragon gave this knight a wound
With his tail upon the heed
that he fell down unto the ground
In a sown as he had been deed
So at the last he rose again
And made his move to god almyght
And to our lady he did complain
their help desiring in that fight
than sterte he with a fayrse courage
Unto the dragon without fail
He looked so for his advantage
that he smote of her tail
Than hegan the dragon for to yell
And turned her upon her side
the knight was w re of her right well
And in her bodt made his sword to slide
So that she coud not remove seartely
the knight that saying approached nere
And smote her heed of lightly
than was he escaped that daungere
Than thanked he god of his grace
Which by his goodness and mercy
Him had preserved in that place
Through virtue of his deyte
Than went he to a nonrye there beside
And there a surge^ and by his art
Heled his wounds that were so wide
And than fro thens he did depart
To ward the rodes for to fight
In bataill as he had undertake
The faith to sustain with all his might
For his promysse he will not break
Than of sarazyns there was a route
All ready armen and in array
That syeged the rodes round about
Fyersly against the good fredaye
The knight was welcomed of echone
That within the cite were
They provided forth battle anon
So for this time I leave them there
And turn to his lady bright
Which is at home with woeful moan
Sore morned both day and night
Saying alas my love is gone
Alas she said my gentyl knight
For your sake is my heart full sore
Might I ones of you have a sight
Before my death I desire no more
Alas what treson or envy
Has made my love fro me to go
I think my lord for Ire truley
By treason him to death has do.
Alas my lord ye were to blame
Thus my love for to betraye
It is to you a right great shame
Sithe that our love was cast al way
Our love was clean in chastyte
Wichout sin still to endure
We never intended vylanye
Alas most curteyse creature
Where do ye dwell where do ye bide
Would god I knew where you to find
Where ever ye go where ever ye ride
Love ye shall never out of my mind
A death where art thou so long fro me
Come and depart me fro this pain
For dead and buried til I be
Fro morning can I not refrain
Fare well dear love, where ever ye be
By you pleasure is fro me gone
Unto the time I may you se
Without comfort still must I moan
Thus this lady of color clear
Aloue mourninge did complain
Nothing could her comfort ne chere
So was she oppressed with woe and pain
So leave we her here in this train
For her love mourning always
and to the knight turn we again
which at Rodes abides the day
Of bataile, so when the day was come
The knights armed them each one
And out of the city went all and some
Strongly to fight with gods fone
Fair and semely was the sight
To se them ready unto the war
there was many a man of might
That to that bataile was come full far
The knight of curtesy came into the field
well armed right fast did ride
Both knights and barans him beheld
How comely he was on each side
Above the helm upon his head
was set with many a precious stone
The comely hear as gold so read
Better armed than he was none
Than the trumpettes began to sound
The speres ran and brake the taye
the noise of gonnes did rebounde
In this metinge there was no play
Great was the bataile on eueri side
the knight of curtesy was not behind
He smote all down that would abide
His mache could he no where find
There was a Sarazin strong and wight
that at this knight had great envy
He ran to him with all his might
and said traitor I thee defy
They ran together with speres long
anon the Sarazin lay on the ground
The knight drew out his sword so strong
and smote his head of in that stounde
Than came twelve Sarazins in a tought
and the knight did sore assail
So they beset him round about
There began a strong bataile
The knight kest four unto the ground
with four strokes by and by
the other gave him many a wound
For they did ever multeplie
They laid on him on every side
with cruel strokes and mortal
They gave him wounds so deep and wide
that to the ground down did he fall
The Sarazins went and let him lie
with mortal wounds piteous to se
He called his page hastily
and said my time is come to die
In mi heart is so deep a wound
that I must dye without nay
But or thou me burye in the ground
Of one thing I thee pray
Out of mi body to cut my heart
and wrappe it in this yelowe here
And when thou do from hence depart
Unto my lady thou do it bear
This promise thou me without delay
to bear my lady this present
And bury mi body in the cross way
the page was sorry and dolent
The knight yielded up the ghost anon
the page him buried as he had him bad
And toward Faguell is he gone
The heart, and here, with him he had
Sometime he went sometime he ran
with woeful moan and sorry Jest
Till unto Faguell he came
Nere to a castle in a forest
The lord of Faguell without let
was in the forest with his meyne
with this page anon he met
Page he said what tidinges with thee
With thy master how is the case
Show me lightli or thou go
Or thou shall never out of this place
The page was a fearde when he said so
The page for fear that he had
the heart unto the lord he took tho
In his courage he was full sad
He took the heart to him also
He told him trothe of eueri thing
How that the knight in bataile was slain
and how he sent his lady that thing
For a special token of love certain
* The lord thereof took good head
And beheld the heart that high present
their love he said was hot in deed
they were both in great torment
Than home is he to the kechin gone
Coke he said harken unto me
Dress me this heart and that anon
In the deintiest wise that may be
Make it swear and delycate to eat
For it is for my lady bright
If that she wist what were the meat
Sothely her heart would not be light
Thereof said the lord full true
That meat was doleful and mortal
So though the lady when she it knew
Than went the lord into the hall
Anon the lord to meat was set
And this lady not far him fro
The heart anon he made be set
Whereof proceeded much woe
Madame eat hereof he said
For it is deynteous and plesaunte
The lady eat and was not dismayde
For of good spyce there did none want
When the lady had eaten well
Anon to her the lord said there
His heart have ye eaten every dele
To whom you gave your yelowe here
Your knight is dead as you may se
I tell you lady certainly
His own heart eaten have ye
Madame at the last we all must dye
when the lady herd him so say
She said my heart for woe shall brast
Alas that ever I saw this day
Now may my life no longer last
Up she rose with heart full woe
And straight up into her chamber went
She confessed her devoutly tho
And shortly received the sacrament
In her bed mournyng she her laid
God wot right woeful was her moan
Alas mine own dear love she said
Sith ye be dead my joy is gone
Have I eaten thy heart in my body
That meat to me shall be full dear
For sorrow alas now must I dye
A noble knight withouten fere
That heart shall certain with me dye
I have reciued thereon the sacrament
All erthly fode here I deny
For woe and pain my life is spente
My lord and husband full of cruelte
Why have you done this cursed deed
Ye have him slain so have ye me
The he god grant to you your mede
Than said the lord my lady fair
Forgive me if I have misdone
I repent I was (...) ware
That ye would your heart oppress so sone
The lady said I you forgive
A dew my lord for evermore
My time is come I may not live
The lord said I am woe therefore
Great was the sorrow of more and less
Both lords and ladies that were there
Some for great woe swouned doubtelesse
All other death full woeful were
Her complaynt pyteous was to here
A dieu my lord now must we disceuer
I dye to you husband a true wedded fere
As any in Faguell was found ever
I am clean of the knight of curtesy
And wrongfully are we brought to confusion
I am clean for him and he for me
And for all other save you alone
My lord ye were to blame truly
His heart to make me for to eat
But sithe it is buried in mi body
On it shall I never eat other meat
Thereon have I recyued eternal fode
Erthly meat will I never none
Now Jesus that was don on the rode
Have mercy on me my life is gone
With that the lady in all their sight
Yielded up her spyrit making her moan
The high god most of might
On us have mercy and us echone
And bring us to that glorious trone
To se the joy of Paradyse
Which god grant to us echone
and to the reders and herers of this treatise.
Thus eneth this little treatise of the knight of curtesy and of the fair lady
of Faguell.
