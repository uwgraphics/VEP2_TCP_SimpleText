The Eglogs of the Poet B. Mantuan Carmelitan, Turned into English Verse, and
set forth with the Argument to every Egloge by George Turbervile Gent. ANNO.
1567.

Imprinted at London in Pater noster Row, at the sign of the Marmayde, by
Henry Bynneman.

To the right worshipful and his good Uncle, Master HVGH BAMFILD Esquier,
GEORGE TVRBERVILE wishes Nestors years, with all good fortune.
WORSHIPFVL, as desire not altogether to be idle and waste the golden Time
(the rarest of all Jewels) procurde me to undertake the translation of this
Poet: so Nature, with your sundry courtesies bestovved on me without hope of
recompense at any time, enforced me (for want of better way to shevve my good
meaning) to dedicate to you this rude and slender Book, translated into our
mother tongue. Hoping that as I have not vvronged the Poet in any point in my
translation, or impairde his credit with the Latins, in forcing him to speak
with an English mouth contrary to his nature and kind: so neither that I have
ministered you occasion to myslike with me for dedication of the same to you: a
man whose benefits I may and will endeavor to requite, but shall never be
able to rid my score of his good turns, or cancel the obligation of his many
and infinite courtesies. If a man be bound by all means that he may to gratify
his well deserving friends: then may not I quiet my self and be at silence
till I have devised the requital of some part of your friendships, by some
slender gift, such as my Fortune and present chance will permit me to
exhibit unto you. And none can I find, either more agreeing unto my state, or
fitter for your worship, than this new translated Poet. Whose title though at
the first perhaps shall seem ouerrude and barbarous (for EGLOGS are altogether
of the Country affairs) yet doubt I not but that both the matter shall be
found pleasant, and the style agreeable to the Latin phrase. I do not mystrust
but MANTVANS Shephierds will use the matter with such dyscretion, and so set
their rusticke Pipes in tune, as you will rather commend their melody, than
myslike their audacitie: that being Countrymen dare undertake to tell their
tales before you, and reason of so many and several matters as in these Eglogs
they do. They were not in that age such siellie sottes as our Shephierdes are
now a days, only having Reason by Experience to prate of their Pastures,
and fold and unfold their flocks: But these fellows, whom the Poet and I
have here brought in, were well able both to move the doubtful cause, and (if
need were) to discide the proponed case. They not only knevve the Calfe from
the Lamb, the Woulfe from the Mastife, but had reason to know the dyfference
tvvixt Town and Country, the odds betwixt Vice and Virtue, and other
things needful and appertayning to the life of man. Wherefore (Uncle) as I
shall crave you to accept this my slender gift, undertaking the Patronage and
Defense of the same: So shall I request the Gods to allow you the aged
Nestors years, with no mysseaduenture in all your life.

Your Nephewe and daily Orator George Turbervile.

To the Reader.
HAVING TRANSLAted this Poet (gentle Reader) although basely and with barren
pen, thought it not good nor friendly to wythhold it from thee: knowing of old
thy wonted courtesy in pervsing Books, and discretion in judging them without
affection. I shall think my pains passing well employed if you show thy
accustomed favor to this Book, which I have now forced to a new and
foreign Language from that it was.

Though I have altered the tongue, I trust I have not changed the Authors
meaning or sense in any thing: but played the part of a true interpretor,
observing that which we term Decorum in each respect, as far as the Peete and
our mother tongue would give me leave. For as y^ conference betwixt Shephierds is
familiar stuff and homely: so have I shapt my style and tempred it with such
common and ordinary phrase of speech as Countrymen do use in their assaires:
always minding the saying of Horace, whose sentence I have thus englished.

To set a Manly head upon a Horses neck,
And all the lims with diverse plumes of diverse hue to deck,
Or paint a vvomans face aloft to open show,
And make the Picture end in fish, with scaly skin belovve
I think (my friends) would cause you laugh and smile to see
How ill these ill compacted things and members would agree.
For in deed, he that shall translate a shephierds tale, and use the talk and
style of an Heroical personage, expressing the siellie man's meaning with
lofty thundering words: in my simple judgment ioynes (as Horace says) a
Horses neck and a man's head together. For as the one were monstrous to see, so
were the other too fond and foolish to read. Wherefore I have (I say) used the
common country Phrase, according to the person of the speakers in every Egloge,
as though in deed the man him self should tell his tale. And the sooner to
let thee understand the matter contained in every treatise, I have (I hope to
thy good lyking) foreset the Argument. If there be any thing herein that thou
shall happen to myslike, neither blame the learned Poet, nor co^troll the
clownish Shephierd (good Reader) but me that presumde rashely to offer so
unworthy matter to thy suruay. But if thou fansy or like well with ought
contained herein, commend Mantuan, extol the Shephierd: suffices me to avoid
scotte free from slanderous snare. If I gain thy good will, I have the guerdon
of my trauile. Thus presuming upon thy patience in perusing this Book, thy
incorrupt Judgment in condemning and allowing the same, I end my Preface,
craving thee to len^ quiet ear to Fortunatus and the rest of his companions.

George Turbervile.

The first Egloge of Mantuan, entitled FAVSTVS.
The Argument:
AS Shepherds custom is
when they do meet yfeare,
To talk of this or that,
and tell the news they hear:
So Fortunatus craves
of Faustus to begin
Of ancient loves to treat,
whilst flocks a feeding been.
When friendly Faustus saw
his earnest friends request:
To tale of honest love
the Shepherd him addressed.
The speakers names.
Fortunatus. Faustus.
Fortunatus Friend Faustus, pray thee, since our flock
in shade and pleasant vale
Does chewe the cudde: of ancient love
let us begin to tale.
Least if by hap unhappy sleep
our senses should begyle,
Some savage beast in sprouted corn^
our cattle catch the while:
For many such about the fields
do lurking lie in wait.
Wherefore to watch is better far
than sleep in my conceyte

^austus. This place, this self same shady bushe
that shrowds us from the heat,
Knows how I have be^ cloyd with cares
and Cupids coals ytreat
These.iiij. years space, or.ij. at least
if I remember well.
But since we are at leisure both,
and pleasant is to tell:
I will begin the whole discourse
and show thee how it fell.
Here I, whilst in my tender youth
of cattle should had care,
Would spread my garment on the soil,
and bolte upright would stare
Into the open Skies alofte:
with d^lefull drops of bryne
And heavy playnt recounting of
this curssed fate of mine.
No pleasure I in quiet took,
no labor did delight
My penstue breast, my Sense was dull,
quight buried was my Sprite:
As is the stomach of the sick
whom no good taste allures
Of loathsome meat, nor patients mind
to appetite procures.
Delight of Music was heresy,
for Pipe I did not pass
Compacted of unequal quilles,
my bow but loathsome was.
The slyng and hound were hateful both,
no pleasure I did put.
In foulyng then, it was yrkesom eke
with knyfe to crack the Nut.
To make the bulrushe basquet, or
to guyle the fish with gyn,
Or search y^ brakes for breeding byrds
I forced not a pyn.
Palester plays, and casting lots
with finger I ne wayd:
Nor former games that pleasant were
ere I this grief assayd.
Wild grapes to gather was a gall,
and Strawberries to pull.
I mournd as Tereus wife is wo^te,
that having beak as full
Of food as it can hold, when she
retourns from her repast
And sees her yonglings borne away,
she waxes all aghast:
And from the byll down falls the bayte,
her heart begyns to quayle,
And to the neighbor bushe she flies
her cruel haps to wayle
For broud so lately borne away.
Or as the gallant cow
That having lost her loving calfe
in field begins to low.
And having filld the place with noise
and crying out a good:
Repaires to shade and eats no grass
nor dips her flaps in flood.
But why do I with long discourse
thy lystnyng ears offend?
This process makes me both my time
and words in waste to spend.
This is the sum of all my tale,
it grieved my weary sprite
That miser I with these mine eyes
did see the loathsome light.
And if thou longyng for to learn
the whole effect, should say:
Who ( Faustus) to these dreadful rocks
did thee compel I pray?
Frind ( Fortunatus) I will show
the very troth to thee.
My little girl that Galla hight
had so entrapped me
With feature of her friendly face
and looks of loving eye,
As in her crafty cobweb does
Arachne catch the fly.
For why her ruddy cheeks did strive
with Coral for their hue:
A pretty round and fully face,
a seemly fight to view.
And of her eyes though one there were
that stood in little steed;
Yet when I did recompte her years
and passing shape in deed:
I did mislyke Dianas face,
I said her feature was
Not worth a rushe, my Galla did
her blasing beauty pass.

Fortunatus. Love ( Faustus) blynds the senses sore,
it guiles the gazing eyes:
It rea^es the freedom from the mind
of man in monstrous wife.
It does bewitch our weakened sprites.
I verily suppose
Some Hellishe Impe does force this fire
and fowly overthrows
And out of h^ke does heave our hearts:
Love is not as they say
A heavenly God, but bitter gall,
and error from the way.

Faustus Besides I had no hope at all
my wisshed good to gain:
Though she (good heart) did rue my case,
and pitied Faustus pain,
And by her becks, and wanton wyncks
her flame appeared playn^.
For what soever way she went
(a cru^ll canckred mate):
Her married Sister her en^^de
and followde Gall^^ gate.
The hard and churlish Mother eke
upon the Wench did watch:
Each thing did hinder mine intent.
Even as the Cat to catch
The pretty, perte, and prickeard Monse
observes with earnest eye
The cloven cranie, and the beast
on bacon flitche does pry

Fortunatus, The porred paunch and stuffed maw
commends fasting much:
And they that are not dry, at those
that long for lycour grutche.

Faustus It Was time with crooked sithe to sheare
the corn that grew in field,
The Barley all about the lands
a golden gleame did yield.
The Mother (as the custom is)
came with her Daughters both,
To gather up the shatered sheaues
which reaper ouergoth.
For she wiste nothing of our Love,
or made as though she had
Not known a white thereof: I think
she was not half so made
But that she found it well enough,
and did dissemble sore:
For she in deed (I stand assurde)
had understood before
Her daughter had a Leueret taken
in paune of my good will:
A pair of stock Dooues eke she had
to keep or else to kill.

Fortunatusus. The want of wealth good nurture marrs
the poor is prone to fall:
He slydes into the snare of shine
and is to vices thrall.

Faustus. The virgin gathering up her grips,
came after me a pace,
With open breast and naked foot
and sleeuelesse arms, in case
As fittest was for scorching heat
and summers scalding blase,
With wreathed bough about her brows
to keep her heauty bright:
For cause the heat will hurt the hue
and make it swarth to sight,
In sort that Lovers never will
conceive thereof delight.
And ever as she did approach
my shattred sheafe I shook:
And as from out my fifth it fell
that up my Minion took.
For women neither can conceal
their griefs and wasting gleede,
Nor conquer cares, ne yet defer
the same till time of need:
Such lightness rayns in the^ by kind
as out it shall with speed.

Fortunatus Who so does love is light God wotte,
not womankinde alone,
But very they that deemed are
to sit in Pallas throne,
And wisedoms gaudy garland wear
about their tried head:
Yea those of poudred purple that
and Senate robes are sped.
Whom I in stately sort have seen
like Royal Kings to walk,
And erst in proud presumptuous sort
about the streates to stalk.
And thou perhaps affectiond so
werte madder of the twain,
And lighter eke: thou shattredst corn,
she took it up again.
Thou gave y^ grain y^ she received,
I pray thee tell me now
Which was the wysest of the both,
the littell trull or thou?
Speak on, for talk is it that must
drive sleep from heavy brow.

Faust^^ The angry Beldam looking back
with shriueled visage prates,
And cride why ( Galla) whither go?
why do thou leave thy mates?
Come hither ( Galla) here among
the Alder boughs I have
Found out a pleasant shady plotte
from Phoebus flames to save
Our ouerchaufed limbs with heat,
the whisling air does cause
The trembling leaves to make a noise,
it is best here right to pause.
O hateful words to Faustus ears:
go gentle winds I pray
And bear (quod I) with nymble gale
this curssed sound away.
If any Shepherd bring his flock
into a fertile vain,
And will not let them feed their fill
but drive them back again,
Or having fed, will stay the stream
and never let them drink,
But force them to forgo the flood:
would thou not surely think
That man to be a monster fell
and natures cruel foe,
And stony hearted that could use
his sielly cattle so?
That voice to me more griefull was
than Iunos husbands threats,
When down he flings his flasshing flaks,
and earth with Imber beats.
I would not, but I could not choose
but backward cast mine eye:
And Galla looking under brow,
began out of hand reply.
She bent her friendly blincks as fast,
and rold her eyes aside:
Which by and by the chiding Dame
by spiteful fortune spide.
And called upon the wanton Wench:
but Galla bent the more
To work, refusde to lend an ear
to her that chid so sore.
As she with foot pursude my pace,
so did she eke in heart:
Then I full like a crafty child,
(for Love ministers art
And does instruct his thrals with dole)
would often sing a song,
And often on the Reapers cry,
and harvest folks among.
A crafty cloak to make the Dame
and wedded Sister leeue
That Galla to their cleping cries
no ear at all did geeue.
With sithe I shore adoun the briers,
for that I would be sure
The pricks to Gallas tender feet
no damage should procure.

Fortunatus Who so does love (no doubt) is slave
and follows (like a thrall
Inchaynde) his chosen Maistresse foot
till yoke his neck do gall.
Sweet blows to bear he is compeld
upon his beastly corse,
He bides the goade, and like an Ox
does draw the plough perforce.

Faustus And thou as far as I can learn,
haste felt Cupidos darte.

Fortunatus Tushe tys a common evil, who has
not played some frantike part?

Faustus This paynfull pleasure of the mind,
this surged venom grew
From day to day to more and more,
more cruel it was to view.
Even as the heat of Phoebus flames
augment their scortching blast:
And partching power from less to more,
till nine of clock be past.
I wore agaste tyke one that was
of late berefte his wits,
Besides my self (no doubt) I was,
and rackte with fruious fits.
Unmindful beast I was become,
I took no nightly rest:
It Was easy eke to know my grief,
The browe bewrayes the breast.
Which thing as sons my Father spide,
more gentle he became
Than earste, for that him self had felt
the force of Cupids flame.
And knew thereof the burden well
how heavy it was to bear:
Wherefore in courteous sort he said.
Son Faustus bannishe fear,
And tell thy father what thou aylste,
and hidden haste in heart:
(Unhappy boy) this face declares
that thou haste felt the darte
Of Love, come off, and take no shame
but tell me how thou fare:
Bewraye to me thy pensive thought
that breeds this cutting care.

Fortunatus Yea, though the father check his child
and use a bended browe,
His mind is frindlier than his face,
he loves him well ynowe.

Fortunatus. I seeing that my Sire became
so courteous, out of hand
Confessed the matter, and declarde
how thoe the case did stand.
I craved his help, he straight behight
that he would do his best:
And so (or ear the winter frost
with glare the ground oppressed)
The kinsfolk and the Father had
betrothde the Maid to me.
But she and I could never deal
alone, but some would see
And warely watch what coil we kept:
I was a Tantal right,
I stood amyd the water, but
I could not drink a whit.
O Lord how often leaving plough
and Oxen all alone,
When she was sole at home, have I
unto her mothers gone?
I would devise excuses store,
the plough tail, or the yoke,
The share, y^ chains, y^ spittestaffe eke
my subtle craft to cloak.
And all at Mother laws I fette,
I could not want a iotte,
But yet (good Wench) her company
I could not have God wotte.
I was not slack to do my due,
to fish, to foul, to hunte:
I t^oe began and practisde feats
that I of yore was wont.
What soever was my luck to catch,
what game so ere I kilde,
To mother laws I bore, and was
surmisde a courteous child.
At midnight once (as promis was
betwixt the Wench and me)
I came unto her Mothers house,
in hope to had some glee:
The Dogs (not sleepy then) at door
some these surmisde to be.
With open jaws on me they ran,
I leapte a hedge in have.
And so with much add escapde
the curssed Curres at last:
With such devises all the cold
and Winter time we past.
The Spring was come, y^ groves were green,
the vine began to spread:
The ploughman Barley began to sow,
for Wheat had taken head.
Lamperydes those glistring fowls
with glowing wings did fly,
Which did declare to husbandmen
that harvest time was nie.
Behold, the marriage days was come,
a wedded wight I was:
What need so many words? at night
to bed in post we pass.
A wisshed time to both God wotte,
my Bark with blessed blast
And merry gale of wind unto
the haven came at last.
Then with a slaughtred Ox two day
we kept a solemn feast,
And underneath a spreading tret
the tables were addressed.
Oenophilus was there, on whom
full fraught with Bacchus wares
And making sport, with willing eyes
the whole assemble stares.
With pipe was Tonius eke at hand,
who after meat to show
His skill, the painted bagpipe raught,
and began thereon to blow.
His alie cheeks with blasting breath
full wide he made to stroute,
When he began to puff the pipe,
he stared all about,
And listed up his bittle brows,
and from his lungs full off,
He drew his wind to fill the bag,
that being stuffed tossed,
And broosed with his elbow down,
did yield his sound aloft.
With finger frisking here and there,
as he was piping aye:
He called the youth from table, and
invited them to play,
And hoppe about the open streets,
and dance away the day.
There are since that three winters past,
fourth Summer comes in place:
I see if any good day there be,
it flies away apace.
Is nothing pleasant in this world
but passes by in have:
But hateful happes and vilest things
we see do longest last.

Fortunatus. O Fauste, do see? to yonder vine,
the flock does go with speed,
Wherefore least we be taxed sore,
it is time to trudge in deed.

The.ij. Egloge entitled FORTVNATVS.
The Argument.
THe pranks that Padus playde
in breaking down his bounds,
And how he had dismayde
men, sheep, and pasture grounds,
His Faustus tale to quite,
here Fortunatus began:
And after to recite
the fond affects of man.
Of mad Amyntas love
and passing rage to tell,
For other men's behoue
this zealous shepherd fell.
The speakers names.
Faustus. Fortunatus.
Faustus HOw hapt (my fre^d) you com so late?
a week is past and gone:
What bred thy stay? annoyes thy sheep
the soil they feed upon?

Fortunatus. O Faustus, Pade the flood that fletes
and runs along our grounds
Was woxen egall with the banks:
it had so past his bounds,
That we not forcyng on our flocks,
for private profits sake
And common safety were constraynde
both day and night to make
A Bay to beat the waters back
and cause them to recoyle,
For fear lest Padus would have drowned
and overflowed our soil.

Faustus. Yea Padus sundry times when he
does swell above his banks,
(As Tityrus can witness well)
plays many spiteful pranks.

Fortunatus. Even as thou say, perhaps he does,
when out of mean and time
He boyles by force of Summer blase,
and boue the bank does clyme.
But now the year requires the same,
for from the frosty hills
The Winter snow descends down:
The Mount with water fills
The slacked floods, and does discharge
him self: the flood as fast
Conuayes his burden and the waves
to gultching Seas does cast.
They play the part that men are wont:
for when the heavy pack,
Does pinche our linunes, we cast it on
our needy neighbors back.

Fortunatus. But now the cha^^ll has reuokde
his spoutyng spring again.

Faustus. O Fortunatus (wonder it is
and moustrous thing to said)
Though Padus do decrease, our lake
with greater sourge does swell:
The City swinunes alost the stream,
a straungie tale to tell.
The vaultes and sellars ditches are,
in whirries men resort
Unto the barrells, drawers have
a ioily glee and sport,
To go by water with their Iacks
and fetch the wine away
By bottels full, that erst full dry
in secret sellar lay.
On Townish men (though happy they
appear to open sight)
Yet many times unhappy haps,
and cruel chances light.

Fortunatus. From every pleasure does arise
displeasure in the end:
And aye from every blessed hap
does balefull luck depend.

Faustus. Thus much of Padus has been told,
now let us recite our Love:
Since friendly Venus thereunto
in each respect does move.
The weather is full warm we see,
the soil is green to view:
The fowls about the field do sing,
now every thing does mewe,
And shifts his rustie winter robe.

Fortunatus. Thou haste in shepherds verse
Declarde thy love, but I will gyn
another to rehearse,
(A shepherd who^ thou know full well)
to make it plain in sight
What force there rests in Venus flame,
and show her stately might.
Amyntas poor (God wotte) and borne
unlucky under sign:
Six calves of egall age possessed,
and had as many kine.
Whom as he drove to pasture with
a Bull that father was
To all the hierd: It was his chance.
by Coytus to pass.
A place where Myncius with his clear
and silver channel flows
And swiftly all the grassy soil
and meadows ouergoes.
A Castle new with battled walls
there faceth on the floode:
High raised up that Coyte hight,
and on the marishe stood.
Here resting him by Rivers side
where grew a goodly vine,
That with his boughs did shade ye ba^ks
and waters passing fine,
He stayde to earth the gliding Fish
with baited hook and line.
I was Harvest time, y^ scorching beams
of scalding Phoebus rays
Had singde the soil, the Nightingale
had laid aside her lays.
The ground was withred in such wise
as neither flock could feed
Thereon by day, nor deawe was left
for Grassehoppers at need,
By night to moist their crikyng chaps.
Here whylst he spent the tide
About the River, and this fond
and vain devise applyde.
The Bull first vexed with the Waspe,
and next with curres they say,
And last by filching Soldiers mean
was quite conuayde away,
Not to be found in field. Which when
the Boy had understood,
He gat him to a Mountain by
and cried out a good
For Bull vnhaply lost of late,
and all the country sought
With greedy gazing eye. But when
he saw it booted naught
And that his pain could not prevail:
his bended Bow he took,
And painted Quiver full of shafts
and for his beast began look
Through woods where was no haunted path,
through every flock and fold,
Through pastures eke to see where he
his Bullock might behold.
About Benacus banks he went,
and Mountes with Olive tree
Beset, and places where both Fig
and Vine was green to see.
At length a haughty hill he hent,
where did a Chapel stand
Of Sulphur, and from thence he cast
his eyes about the land,
And over viewde Benacus bounds,
and all the country round,
To see where in that coast there were
his Bullock to be found.
It was Saint Peter's day by course
and custom of the year,
The youth of every village by,
at after noone was there:
And underneath a greenysh Elm
that shadowed all the soil,
At sound of pleasant country pipe
they dauncde, and kept a royle,

Faustus The country Cloines can not be tan^de
by any kind of art,
Unquiet they delight in sweat:
when Priest has done his part,
And morning Prayers ended are,
the Holy day (when all
Should cease from toil) impacie^t they
of rest and hunger, fall
To fillyng of their greedy mawes
and tossyng of the cup:
And hye to dance, as soon as mynstreil
gyns to pype it up:
They tread it tricksie under tree,
one skippes as he were mad,
An other iumpes as twere an Ox
unto the Altar lad.
The sacred soil (that sin it were
to turn with toyling share,
And cut with crooked culter) they
can not endure to spare:
But friske thereon like fra^tike fools
unwieldy wights (God wot)
With leaden legs and heavy heels
about the Churchyard trot.
And all the day do cry and laugh,
and lay their lips to pot.

Fortuna. Thou dolt, why do thou chat of this?
thy self a rustike borne:
The manners of the country Cloines,
and rustike route do scorn.
Thou do thy self condemn withal,
thou art thy proper foe.

Faustus. Tushe of Amyntas let us chat,
let all these matters go.
I spoke it but in sport (my friend)
I trust you take it so.
He stayde, and leaning gaynst his staff
ymade of Acer tree,
Did stint from travail till the heat
might somewhat swaged be.
O most unhappy hapless youth,
in shade a greater flash
Will seize thy corpse: shut up thine eyes
least whilst Diana wash
Her lovely limbs in silver stream
thou naked her epsy:
Or lend a listening ear unto
the Sirens when they cry.
Thy luck with Narcisce heavy lore,
may well compared be:
For whilst in Well he sought to slake
his thirst, the more was he
(Unlucky lad) with drought attachde:
so whilst thou do devise
This outward heat to flee, an inward
flame does thee surprise.
How much had better been (I pray)
and happier for thee,
(Unless the fatal Gods would had
thy destnie so to be)
To thy remainder flock in field
to have returned back,
And kept thy Kye, and let alone
the Bull that was a lack:
And taken in good part the loss
of that one beast alone,
Than thus, in seeking naught to find
thy self to have forgone.

Faustus. Oh Friend, who is not wise become
when things are at the wurst?
It Is naught to give advise in fine
that should been had at furst.

Fortunatus. The counsel that comes after all
things are dispatched at last,
Is like a shower of rain that falls
when sowing time is past.
Among the rest of all the route
a passing proper Less,
A white haird trull of twenty years
or near about there was:
In stature passing all the rest,
a gallant Girl for hew:
To be co^pard with Townish Nimphs
so fair she was to view.
Her forhead cloth with gold was purlde
a little here and theare:
With copper claspe about her neck
a kerchiefe did she wear.
That reached to her breast and paps:
the Wench about her wast,
A gallant gaudy ribande had
that girte her body fast.
In Peticote of country stuff
Mockadoe like, she goes:
I was plaited brave, y^ length was such
it hoong nie to her toes.
As soon as her the youth had spide,
he perished by and by:
By sight he sucked in the flame,
and mean of wanton eye:
He swallowde up the blinding fire,
and in his belly plast
The coals that neither waves could quench
nor rainie imber wast,
No not incha^tme^ts, witches words,
it cloong so close and fast.
Forgetful he of former flock,
and damage done with waves,
Was all imaged with this flash,
at night he naught but raues.
The season that for quiet sleep
by nature poynted was,
In bitter plaintes and cruel cries,
this burning Boy did pass.
I sundry times for pities sake
his growing flame to stay,
And stop the frantike fury, would
to him full often say:
O lamentable lad, what God
has forcde thee thus to fare?
But sure it was no work of Gods
that bred this bitter care.
Nay rather it was the cruelst impe,
and spitefulst fiende of hell,
Of those with Lucifer that from
the skies to dungeon fell,
That nine days space were tumbling down:
I pray thee make me show
And call to mind where ever yet
thou any man dydst know
By foolish love aduauncde to wealth,
or any office borne:
Or raisde by means thereof his house,
or stufft his barnes with corn?
Dydst ever any know that has
thereby enlargde his bounds:
Increaste his flock, or for his hierd,
ygotten fruitful grounds?
Among so many countries tell
me, if thou heardst of one,
At any time through all the earth
I think was never none.
There are that to their bloody boordes
our crushed bodies bear,
And butcherlike (with greedy teeth)
our rented corses tear.
There are, I say, whom spit full fiends
unto such practice drive:
Yet is there no such kind of men
so cruel here alive:
No country is so barbarous,
is none so savage seckte,
As does not hate the woman's love
and fancies fond reiecte.
Thence brawles ar bred, thence chidings come,
thence broiling war and strife
Yea often eke with sheading blood
the cruel loss of life.
By means thereof are Cities sacked,
and Bulwarks beat to ground:
Moreover Laws and sacred Books
in iron chains ybounde,
Forbid and give us charge to flee
in any case this Love:
With words expressly Cupide they
and all his toys disprove.
Amyntas had no sooner heard
the name of Laws rehearst,
But answered (for in City he
a Boy was fostred erst)
Thou go about to far surmount
by giving this advise
The Catos both, and to be thought
both circumspect and wise.
This error and this madness bears
each where a cruel swaye:
Man flattreth with him self, and would
be counted crafty, aye
A creature able to forsee:
yet many a snare and gin
And ditche that he him self has delu'de
the Miser falls in.
He first was free, but to his neck
him self did frame the yoke:
In servile chain him self he bound,
and bands of freedom broke.
So weighty are those Laws (my self
have seen the Books ere this)
As neither predecessors, nor
our selves can keep ywis:
Nor aftercommers shall observe
the meaning of the same.
Behold the foolish wit of man,
that thinks such feate to frame,
As to the heavens to aspire:
and hopes at length to get
Among the glistryng stars aloft
a stately room and seat.
Perhaps when life is lost, he shall
into a foul conuarte:
And then his feathred soul with wyngs
to welkin shall depart.
And then (quod I) what brawle is this?
since God did so devise
The laws, twere foul offense for man
his statutes to despise.

Faustus. These are debates of great affairs
and weighty things in deed.

Faustus. Wott'st thou what kind of man I was?
though ragged be my weed,
And I a rustike now to see:
then both in force and mind
And looks, I was a roysting lad.
Thou should not lightly find
A shepeheard to be matchte with me.

Faustus. And yet if bolte upright
Thou stalk with countnance cast aloft
thou will appear in sight,
A second Marius to be:
let Barbar shave thy face
With razer, and in countenance thou will match with Carbos grace.

Fortunatus. Amyntas would like answer make
when I his folly blamde:
But to proceed: when God had man
in perfect figure framde,
He did repine thereat and thought
the pleasures he allowde
Too passing were: and did restrain
our lust with law, and bowde
Our Rebel minds with new decrees:
as Horsemen use to tie
Their iades with brakes about ye jaws
for fear they go awrie.
Herein Love maks me show my mind,
and fancy freely tell:
Who so debarres his wife to go
in common does not well,
But envious may accounted be.
But yet this spiteful hate
The cloak of honest custom does
in some respect abate.
For whilst each man unto him self
(not forcing common good)
Reserved his private joys, and to
his marriage bargain stood.
A common custom is incrochte
that Honesty is hight,
Good faith to make such pieuish laws
it was mad and foolish spite.
A hateful thing is Love (God wotte)
and pleasure spiteful eke.
Then I no longer daring to
the Youth athwarte to speak,
Shook of the raging wanton Boy
that seemde berefte of sense:
And on my former voyage I
eftsone departed thence.

Faustus. See how this vile Affection fond
our inward eyes of mind
Shutts up in such despiteous sort,
and makes us men so blind,
As headlong we to errors runns
and to deceiptfull snare:
Till time we be in wilful trappe
and nipt with cutting care?

Fortunatus. Oh, do thou see (friend Faustus) how
the pitchy clouds upon
Mount Baldus to a cluster go,
and join them selves in one?
It hayles, for fear our cattle be
dispersed, let us be gone.

The.iij. Egloge entitled FAVSTVS.
The Argument.
THe Tylmans wearye toil
and troublous life he splayes:
And last Amyntas cruel foil
by frantic Love bewrayes.
The speakers names.
Faustus. Fortunatus.
Faustus THe hayle (my friend) from Baldus mount
that yesterdaye did fall
(We thank the Gods, y^ save our corn)
anoyde us naught at all.
But Harculus reported has
and bruted here a fame:
That in the coast was much a do
from whence he lately came.
Verona fields were pestred sore,
the cattle with the fold:
The Shepecots and the Barnes the hail
(as he half weeping told)
Has ouerwhelmde and laid on ground,
and in such sort defast:
As all good hope that husbands had
is quite berefte and past.
For Cattle is the only wealth
that Country men enjoy,
And Pasture ground that subject is
to this and like anoy.
The Citizens have heaped hoords
and coffers full of pence:
That safely under lock do lurk
and need no other fence.
No hayle can hurt, no force of frost
their coffred coin can mar:
No crusshing yse, nor stormy clouds
that in the Welkin war.
I wot not who does rule the winds,
and bears the swinging swaye
Among the fell tempestuous Skies:
I wot not what to say.
I know not, no nor though I did,
that knowledge would suffice:
I dare to speak. But what? shall I
for such an enterprise
Be here alive tormented thus?
if Gods (as men report)
The Skies do govern from above
and rule in such a sort:
I think they force not on the pains
and troublous toils of man.
See how with daily sweat of brow
we get as wel's we can
A slender living (God he knows)
behold what cruel pains
The sielly Shepherd for his flock,
his babes and spouse sustaynes.
With too much heat in So^mer cloyde,
in Winter nipte with cold:
The Raynie days upon the ground
we sleep in Shepecots old.
And either thousand mischiefs of
the soil our cattle spill:
Or Cooth, and daily vile disease
and thousand dangers kill.
The filtching Thief does watch y^ fold,
the Woulfe does lie in wait:
The Soldier eke that far excels
the Woulfe for such deceyte.
Yea though with daily trade and toil
our hands well hardened be,
And full of knobby hills our fistes,
though visage swart to see,
Though staring be the beard to view
and shryu'led eke the skyn:
One shower of hayl with sodayn whis^
makes all not worth a pyn.
And this by Gods themselves is done,
to whom we Shepherds we
Do crouche at sacred Altar stone
with twyfold bended knee,
and offer holly candles up.
I wot not what this Piety
and Clemency does mean,
That stelly us poor Sepheards spoils
of all our substance clean,
And wraps us in a thousand ylls
that think no hurt at all.

Faustus. Oh ( Fortunatus) our offense
procures these plages to fall.
And light upon our hateful heads
that well deserve the same:
The judgment of our God is just,
he not deserves blame.

Fortuna. What heinous fact of ours I pray?
did we his death conspire?

Faustus. For brawles, theft, anger, baudy life,
and lies we have this hyre.

Fortunatus. What have the good deserved then?
all are not ill alyke:
Yet all at once with egall scourge
the hateful Hag does stryke.

Faustus. Oh vile offense, so evil to think
of God is heinous crime:
Wherefore omitting needless things
not to be known, in time,
Amyntas troubles let us repeat
and cares endurde of old,
Which we of force by trial know,
let them I say be told
Afreshe. For Love a practice is
full common now a days:
A daily trade which ouertmuch
the tender youth assayes.

Fortunatus. Friend, (mourning, and such like affects)
do overthrow the heart,
And plages the mind: he tells a woeful
tale that tastes smarte.

Faustus. Well may a man debate of things
as state and time require,
But not of such as he ne knew:
So Cosmas did aspire
To be accounted wise and grave.

Fortuna. Thou do (friend Faustus) well
And wisely: wherefore let us begin
well known Loves to tell.
Remaynes of good Amyntas rage
and latter fate to rue,
And that unhappy chance of his
with bitter tears pursue.
I saw, Narratio.
as I by fortune past
eftsone that way again,
The man inradge: and taking ruth
of sielly Lovers pain,
Bespake him as I erst had done.
O wilful wight (quod I)
That with this fatal venom vile
besotted so do lie,
Of whom the people have their talk
and babble every day,
Have thou not yet put fancies fond
and folish thought away?
But buried deep in Love do lie?
what? will thou spoil both thee
And thine, thy Cattle and thy Coote
as erst did Sampson he
That Giant huge that halde the house
and roof upon his head?
When crooked lymping age shall com^
and brave Iuuenta fled,
(If Fates allow thee old to be)
who will relieve thee than
Poor, idle, drouste, senseless wight,
and feeble forcelesse man,
All these (unless untimely death
preuente) with Age will grow.
Go to, have home, be ware and wise,
and whither thou do go
Take heed, and shun the place where hurt
may fortune to arise:
Be ware (I say) thy future state
foresee with careful eyes.
Discern the path thou mindst to pace,
and fix thou fast in mind
That man in woman's pleasures and
delights is not assinde
To wast away his youthful Prime.
For why the foolish toy
And wicked lust of wanton Love
does tender age annoy.
Even I that Cattle have good store
and milk and cheese ynow,
Live hardly, and do wear away
the world with sweat of brow
And much ado God wot. For why
our fields did fail of late,
Such need does raygne in every plae
we are at beggars state.
So many heavy happes we have,
such mischiefs daily light,
Such crabbed luck as all the world
is now in piteous plight.
Give ear to things not heard alone
or spread by bruted fame,
Nor many years ago betyde,
my self have seen the same:
And at this day do daily view,
the proof does now appears.
As custom is, in Month of May
I erst my Sheep did sheare,
And threescore pounds of passing wool
betyme to sale did set:
But now a days I thought alike
like gaynes thereby to get,
And scarce could keep my flock alive
and Winter fodder bie,
In frost and snow the cruel want
of pasture to supply.
Oh Lord ( Amyntas) how my folk
shall live I know not I.
Who so does love, unto his Less
must many presents send:
But thou whom scarce a house to dwell
would cruel Fortune lend:
Where day and night is want of wealth
and lack of golden see:
How can thou shift to send thy Trull
ought that may grateful be?
Ear this suffisde unto a Maid
ten appels gay to bring,
A Garland fresh of fragrant flowers,
a Neast of birds to sing.
I knew when in as great a price
the country maids did hold
A Garland as a better gift:
but now from grass to gold
They are ascended, Love is now
become a stately thing:
The ancient custom is decade
new laws do daily spring
As touching trade of greedy Love,
they gape for greater gain.
With angry brow and lowering look
repleate with foul disdain
To me persuading thus bespake
Amyntas. Friend (quod he)
Friend Fortunatus, if thou long
to purchase ease to me
And wisshed comfort to reduce,
allow me that I Love:
That only thing my crankred grief
and gripings may remove.
The rest thou babblest torments are,
this fury will not stinte
Nor rooted be from out my heart.
Within my breast the printe
And Image of the Virgin sits.
With me she soiournes aye:
With me she goes and makes return,
when I return by day.
At night with me she lodges eke
and sleeps in self same bed.
She has so seazde upon my bones,
my marrow, heart, and head,
As never may she well depart
till life these lymmes has fled.
And as, what time a tender slip
cut from a foreign tree
Is grafte into another stock
their natures joined be,
And so by growth become as one:
even so the Virgins grace
And Image of her comely look
and Idol of her face
Was planted deep within my breast,
our hearts became as one,
Both one our mynds, the difference
twixt her and me was none.
One sense, one soul did serve us both
our lymmes so lincked were.
Oh happy I, if when my corse
shall dead be placed on Bear,
And fatal Sisters shrid my twist
and finger close mine eye,
I might twixt those her lilly arms
and pappes in bosom lie:
With heavy head when soul were past
and lively line ycutte,
That she these dying eyes of mine
mougth with her finger shut.
And might with shrill and doleful voice
beweepe my heavy fate:
And pour her crystal tears adowne
for loss of loving mate.
Where to the blessed Fields that are
alloted to the good
I after life do pass: or forcde
down to the Stygian flood
And fiery stream of Phlegeton
those freatting fitts abide:
Me neither pain withouten thee
nor pleasure shall betyde.
O Dryads, and yea sacred Nimphs
of flowers that have the care,
O Sire Syluanus that do rule
where pleasant arbours are:
I pray you guard amyd your mounts,
and shady vales below
The sweet and smellyng flowers that
within your circuits grow,
(The beauty of the Country fields
and queachy Groves we have)
Do hedge your bounds from feeding flocks
the floury soil to save.
Reserve (I pray you) them till need
to deck the Hearse withal
Of my sweet wench when she by stroke
of dreadful death shall fall.
Then, then let all y^ ground be strowde,
let garlands then be plide:
At time of death and burial of
my Love her Hearse to hide.
Pierides the pensive Nymphs
at hand shall then be priest,
With weeping eyes lamenting of
the Grave so gayly dreste.
And shall insculpe these woeful words
upon the Marble stone,
Of after comers to be read
when we are past and gone.
Here buried lies a Last
that wanted naught at all
Save that she cruel was,
a sacred Saint to call.
Oh Virgin if so great a fire
did burn within thy bones
By thousand Scyllas and as many
Charybds I at ones
Would swym to thee to breed thy ease:
thou feller than a snake
Do flee thy friend. But what need I
so much ado to make?
And blame y^ wight? she knows me not.
No doubt if so the maid
Had understanding what I were,
she would procure mine aid.
There can not be a brazen breast
where does such feature flow:
But yet we must not overmuch
believe the flattring brow.

Faustus. For often under smothest skin
does lurk a cankred mind:
And under friendly forhead is
a hateful heart to find.
I will go talk and let her wit
of this my hidden fire.
But oh, if she should wrie her looks,
and bar me my desire:
To tears my Crystal eyes would soon
convert as you should see,
My woeful breast to sobbyng sighs
transformed straight would be.
And though she hate me (cruel) aye
and flee her friend apace:
Yet me this wasting care will still
pursue in every place.
Fare well ye Physic arts, for I
am not to be recurde:
Adieu ye eke to fetch from Hell
the souls that are invrde
With Magic verse and Witches call,
(ungodly thing to leeue)
Farewell ye all that vaynely hope
with bootelesse words ye geeue,
The steely minds of Gods to wrest:
for now I see the Skies
Are cruel foes of mine and will
not bend for all my cries.
Impacient fury draws me on,
it does me good alone
To range the hills, and wa^der through
the woods and caves unknown
The doutful dens of dredful Beasts.
Him speaking thus I thought
And went about with friendly words
to wrest, but all for naught.
The curelesse wou^d by no means ca^
to perfect state be brought
He myd the silent Night amids
the fields would rangle aye:
In bushy Launds with waking eyes
he walked at creek of day.
The Wilding was his only food,
the Crab he used to crash:
And with a draught of water he
his thirsty jaws did wash
And was therewith right well content.
At length unhappy Lad
When he his many woeful cries
and schritches yelled had,
When tearelesse woxe his wasted eyes
and dry for want of wette,
When he with often reboundyng sobbes
his bulk had all to bette:
Came gentle Death, and quiet brought
to his unquiet stay.
The Carcas dead and brethlesse Corpse
that there vnterred lay
Withouten honor of the grave
the Savage beasts by night,
And greedy tyring filthy Fowls
by day devoured quight.

Faustus. Oh murreyn vile and fatal ginne,
that with thy venomde darts
The bulks of men do pierce, and poysned
shafts our mortal hearts,
And makst us brutish seem to sight,
no bet than savage are.
What cup of Circes, or Calipso
might with this compare?
What drench might Stix, or Phlegeto^,
or Furies worsse devise?
O doltes that Love account a God,
O blind and bleared eyes.
Is God a Nature hurtful? No.
Where ever he does won,
He ruthful is to man, and does
no ill, of dexter doom.

Fortunatus. Oh Woeful wretched Boy that in
thy tender years did die:
What time y^ thou were born what stars
bare sway in swinging Sky?
What part of welkin wrought thy woe?
that did deserve no ill?
What curssed corner of the Heavens
did thee untimely kill?
Yet was not all the Heaven thy foe,
thou could as well as we
With Oaten quill and pleasant pipe
make ioily game and glee.
Had not this over hasty death
thy life so soon oppressed,
Thou had deseru'de Pernassus crown
and Laurel with the best.
No better Tytirus (belou'de
of his Alexis) roong
Of cruel fight, of dreadful war,
and of his tillage soong
Than thou: for why thy timely ripe
capacity was known
To us, it did presage what fruit
in time thou would have sown.
No vulgar trial of thy skill,
and toward wit was seen:
It well declarde if thou had liude
what thou would after been.
Now moughtst thou ben accounted thou
the glory and the praise
Of all our soil, not such a one
did live in these our days.
Thee Padus, and with weeping brows
our Myncius did lament,
Yea Nimphs themselves: as Hebrus erst
for Orpheus was bedrent
With trickling showrs of falling tears.
The master shepherds all
Did rue thy death as Daphnis erst
was pitieo for his fall.
Thee all the Champion fields about,
both hill and vale do cry:
And all the Pasture grounds did lift
their clamours to the sky.
O Shepheardes with sweet smellyng flowers
bestrow his bitter grave:
The song of Priest and fuming Cense,
(Oh, yearly) let him have.
Ye Poets eke eternal rest
wish to his graued Ghost.

Faustus But what? ( Amyntas) thou do lodge
in far a better coast
Than we, in Fields for happy souls
allotted thou do won:
And we below in Earth bewail
thy Clipse of life begone.

Fortunatus I knew we should lament to day,
for yesternight I saw
Such cruel sights amid my sleep,
as bred my present awe.
But now you see the night is come,
descending of the Sun
In Cloud declares y^ showrs at hand,
wherefore it is time to run
To fold our flock. And Faustus thus
my woeful Tale is done.

The.iiij. Egloge entitled ALPHVS.
The Argument.
HEre Ianus shows the Goat was lost,
he tells the curssed Fate
And does bewray the Bedlam Boys
unhappy frantike state.
And by the way good Alphus he
to quite his fellows pain:
The kind of woman does depaint
and makes their manners plain.
Let never honest Lucrece lowre,
let no good Grisell grutch:
For neither Alphus here, nor I
the modest matrone toutch.
We nippe the cruel cankred crew
with beauty that allure,
And having thralde the miser, seek
no salve his sore to cure:
But take delight with scornful chere
and face of foul disdain
Like Vipers vile to sow the seeds
of our fast springing pain.
Those, those ar they that Ma^tua^ means
those Alphus does declare:
And I (the Poet to explane)
those Dames no whit will spare.
The speakers names.
Alphus. Ianus.
Alphus. MOre lean (Oh Ianus) seems thy Goat
than ere he was of yore:
For lusty he his horns ere this
into the Welkin bore.
But grouelyng now on ground he lies
with lyther lolling ears,
He smelles to grass, to touch the herbs
at length of lips he fears.

Ianus. He droupes, and of his drouping does
a pleasant jest arise:
Which look how often I mind, does make
me laugh with smyling eyes.
As yet it is not spread abroad,
but when the brute is blown,
And that through every country is
this pleasant story known:
Then all y^ world will laugh thereat

Alphus. (O Ianus) thou ere this
Werte wont to tell a merry jest
in merriest wise ywis,
And with a sweet delighting voice:
Wherefore I pray thee now
Declare me why the Goat does droupe,
and tell how fell it how?

Ianus. God is my judge it was never faynde
of me, but done in deed,
And lately too: But shall I tell
the tale withouten meede?
And chatte for naught and wast'my wind?
Nay, what wilt give to me?
What shall I have for telling of
this jest beglarde with glee?

Alphus. O friend, when so the Nightingale
(that Philomela hight)
Has built her nest, and sitts a brood
I will thy travail quight.

Ianus. Who so does make such rash behests
by daily proof we see
Performs not pacted promise, but
his touch is wont to flee.

Alphus. Nay, who so lends such light belief
distrust does bear in breast.
But for you shall be sure that I
nill play the guilefull guest,
Take here a pledge of promise made
and bargain erst by me:
Take here (I say) from out my case
two Flights that far will flee.

Ianus. I will begin: O sacred Nimphs
Parnasides I pray
Do move your jaws, and guide my tongue
that I may well display
My well-beloved Goats mishap
and misaduenture fell:
And grant that Alphus Nightingale
may hatche her yonglings well
That I may have that he behight
for this good tale I tell.
With penny I a Lad did hire
my little flock to keep: Narrati^

I g^ue him charge and oversight
of all my fleezie sheep.
He kept both Kids and females eke,
and Ram goats too with care:
And ouerlook'd my flock that I
the Stripling could not spare.
Till time at last by Fortune he
a pretty Maiden saw,
(That hither came of purpose bent
at water place to draw
Such water as suffisde her turn)
and liked her so well
As he (good Boy) by feature of
her face to fancy fell.
And from that time and doleful day
so dumpish he became,
As less regard he had of sheep,
(the greater was his shame)
Less forced he since that the foldes
and quight berest of wit
He seemde: So deep within his breast
the Virgins shape did sit.
When he on bed to quiet nap
his weary limbs did lay:
Where sleeping he or waking were
it was very hard to say.
For when he was wide waking he
such frantike coil would keep,
As though (his reason quite bereft)
his wits were gone to sleep.
So dreamyng was this Boy to sight,
so lumpishe wore the Lad:
In sort, that gazers on surmisde
that he no senses had.
This Boy bent to refresh (I say)
his ouertyred mind
With sportyng play, about the horns
with twig this Goat did bind
Among the thickest of the briers
and bushy Laundes below:
And so to pass away the time
away the Boy did go.
(And now.iiij. days are past and gone)
thus he the Goat did tie:
The strongnesse of the With and hardness
of the Horns to try.
Meanewhile the woods he went about
and raungde the bushes round,
To see where that within the place
might any birds be found.
The Maid resorted to his thought
and vndercrept his heart:
The comely countnance of the Trull
could never thence depart,
Nor beauty of her bourly breast
his musyng mind forgo,
The parts not to be namde he rollde
within his bulk below.
Meanewhile the Sun had lodgde his light,
that stelly sotted Mome
Unmindful of his hamperde beast
afielde, came late to home.
Amid the night he callde to mind
that foolish fact of his:
And thinking to go loose the Goat
in all the have he rise.
And whilst with fearful foot he pac^de
through Dampes as dark as Hell,
Where lay much chafe and rotten straw,
into a Dyke he fell:
A place of purpose made to take
the savage Beasts by night,
A hollow vault and dungeon deep
to steep for any wight
Once being in to clamber up.
Thus was the Goat by him
Fast bound with twigs, the Page in pit
ycaught and dungeon dim.
No Shepherd kept the beasts as then,
it was well near three a clock:
I musde, and went my self about
and numbered all the flock.
I missd the Goat, and maruelde much
what of the heast became,
I sought about the flelds: at last
I calde the Boy by name.
(I tell but truth) I stood in fear
least he by Magike mean
And Sorcerie had been raisde to Skies,
and Goat dispatched clean.
For Hags and Witches by report
are caught amids the night
Much like, and far to Banquets borne
quite out of cry and sight.
This dreading, I to Pasture ground
did bring my sheep at last
To feed their fills, and whilst that I
did wander all aghast
In irksome shades and vgglie nookes,
and entered in the Grove:
I heard a far the braying of
my Goat, and how he strove
With punching horns and pushyng pate
against the With a good
I plainly saw, and how he bette
the Bushe against which he stood.
This gastfull thing affrighted me,
and monstrous sight to view
Unlooked for. But when at length
my sielly Beast I knew
And bolder woxe, I went me in
among the brakes in have:
With hook I hewde the bre^bles down
and bushy briers at last.
As late in evening home I hide,
all round about the field
A girnyng route of grinning folks
by fortune I beheld.
Approaching nearer to the preasse
me each began to greet
As soone's they knew what man I was,
and friendly did entreat.
Lo here (quod they) O Ianus is
a little Lad of thine
Taken up a Woulfe his den of late
a deep and dangerous Mine.
He wandering late about the Dounes
did happen (to his pain)
Upon this cave, but now both Goat
and he be found again.
The Goat that had this cruel hap
as yet unlusty is:
But yet the foolish Boy of both
most frantike is ywis.
The Virgin hearing that the Lad
did love her passing well:
Eftsoone as proud as Pecocke woxe
and with disdain did swell.
And making wise she had not wiste
the cares he did endure,
Pretended honest life the more
the striplyng to allure.
And to increase her beauty more
she deckes both face and breast
In finest wise, and in her gate
her looks to ground she keast.
Thus Foxelike she with simple show
and seemyng to the eyes,
In double breast and subtle heart
her crafty meaning plyes.
These are the tricks that women use,
this is the sleightfull ginne:
These are the cruel weapons that
the minds of men do win.
Thus hoping he his Gallant girl
to conquer at the last,
His wages scornde, and plide his love,
and follows her in have.
Wherefore now leaving Cart and plough
and Oxen all alone,
To Shepherds toil I will return.
Frail youth (the more the moon)
Is vassal to this fury fell
and to this folly thrall:
It wanders round about this coast,
and ouerturneth all.

Alphus. Lo, see what Wit can not devise
by Fortune comes to thought:
O wondrous chance, O happy hap
that this to mind has brought.
O famous jest for two months space
well able glee to make:
Good faith for thee the Nightingale
now sitts a brood in brake.
But that which thou of subtle sleight of crafty Less did sing,
What Vmber erst of woman's guile
has wrote, to mind does bring.

Ianus. O tell us Vmbers merry Verss,
if thou have ought in store
Now out withal: they say he wrote
a stately style of yore.

Alphus. It Is as thou tellst, but for my tale
what recompense remains?
What thanks shall I? what guerdon have
for undertaken pains?

Ianus. Go to, Ill stand to bargayne made
keep thou those darts of mine.

Alphus. O Ianus, whilst I go behind
that yonder sedge, repine
Not thou to drive along my flock
but force them onwarde still,
For fear leaft in my absence they
the neighbor Vine do spill.

Ianus. O Ram I say, that for thy horns
the Devil do represent,
To enter in the Vine thou aye
with cankred mind art bent.
Thou never wilt be ware and wise,
till from thy forhead I
With cruel iron for the nones
do reaue thee either eye:
And make the^ leave that pieuish pate
and horned head of thine:
Will not a hundred Acres serve
but thou must to the vine?

Alphus. Oh, now at my return I have
reuokte to mind somewhat
Of those self things we me^tiond erst,
of all I can not chat.
But Vmber wist of erie thing,
that man by wisdom knows:
The Sky, ye Stars, ye ground, ye winds,
the Sea, the floods that flows.
The Fou^tayns eke and spouting springs,
at Rhodop he has been:
Epyrps fiery mountains he
and Ossa erst has seen.
The soil of France, and Araris,
both Rhodan, Tyber, Pade:
And out of curious Greek he has
his Latin myter mate.
A worthy wight for either speech,
and skilde in either tongue,
As wel's the best that ever yet
has: Latin verses song.
Him specially the learned Greeks
repined sore to see
Arcadians, Thrace and Thessatie
our Countreyman to beew.
His doctrine and his trade of life
good Candid followed aye
That dwells hereby, he skillful is
he shall declare the way
And ready path to us: meanewhile
let Shephierles us assay
With ioylie blast of puffing breath
on Oten Pipe to play.
But first of all I pray the Nimphs
here pre^^t bein place:
But chief (...), for they say
she has the (...) grace.
These W^^^n are a servile sect, Narratio

cursed, cruel, (...) with pride:
Rejecting laws, refusing mean,
from reason wandering wide.
They frorm the bounds of better life,
extremes are best in price:
What they attempt is rashly done
and quite without advice.
A Woman either not provoke
like Lead full l^^pish (...)
Or being once (...) up, too fa^
about her things she hies.
Aye Winterlike, a frowning cheer
and frostie face she bears:
Even as the Dog with cruel star
the singed soil that seares.
She never keeps the golden mean:
for either passing well
She loves thee, or with mortal hate
pursues thy ghost to Hell.
If grave she covet for to seem,
too grimme becoms her grace:
She powteth then and fiercely frowns.
But if with friendly face
She long to look, her gravity
is banished out of place,
Those looks demure and Matrone like
leude laughter has in chase.
Straight Giglot like she waxes light,
she grins with childish cheer:
In smyling brow a Whorish mirth
does shiningly appear.
She sobs, she laughs, right wise she is
as frantic as a Hare:
Oppressed with tre^bling fear she quakes
and yet too much does dare.
She will, she will not, ever so
her thoughts contrary are.
Unconstant, light, vain, chatting, and
a double tongue does bear,
Presu^ptuous, threatfull, thirsting blood,
disdaynfull erye wheare.
Vile, greedy, catching, quareling aye
and strouting full of hate:
Of light belief, and bent to lies,
impatient of her state.
A costely charge, to quaffing given,
rash, bitter, jesting, light,
Ambitious, Soceresse, brothell baude,
with supersticion fright,
Too laasie, greedy gutted, and
to Lechers lust inclynde:
Sweet mowthde, venerious, wanton, of
too nice and dayntie kind.
To flattry bente and paynting of
her face with forrayne freake:
She keeps in cankred heart her hate
till time she may awreake
And be avenged of her foe,
unfaithful thanklesse eake.
Malicious, hasty in revenge,
bold, bedlam, wrangling wight,
A rebel, stubborn, stiff as stake.
She takes a great delight
To cast in teeth her old good tournes:
if any her accuse
Of guyltie crime, with Tragike voice
her self she will excuse.
She mumbles to her self, she stirs
debate, she forces naught
Of promise made, she friendship scorns,
and ever has in thought
Her private gain and no man's else:
she iestes, she flatters aye
She tells thy counsel, and as she
thy secrets does bewray
With bitter scoff she pays thee home,
she triflyng news does spredde
Among the people, and does add
to every tale a shredde,
And of a hillocke makes a mount.
She does dissemble sore,
She makes in wise, and bears in hand
and learned has of yore
Untruths and leasings to devise,
to craft she wants no art:
She wots well how to every chance
her countnance to conuart.
Man can not well avoid her guile,
nor shun her foxely drifts:
So many are her mischeous crafts,
so sundry are her shifts,
And subtle sleights her craft to cloak.
Yea and put case that thou
With present eye behold her feats,
yet she with shameless brow
Will dare excuse committed crimes:
by cloaking craft she can
And double dealing of the mind
delude the Sense of Man.
We wotte not how to credit ought
that her report does blow:
And yet if she would have us think
that all she says is so,
We can not but believe the same,
she drives us to affie:
Hereto examples may persuade.
What curssed crime to try
Has not a Woman had the heart
and ventrous hand of yore?
Tarpeia to her country foes,
(that mortal hatred bore
To Roman state) the Capitol
did yield, in hope to have
The Jewels that about the wrests
of Soldiers glistred brave.
Medea with her babes blood
imbrued her beastly hands,
Fair Helen thousand Barges brought
unto Aegean sands.
For Minos love (her fathers foe)
whom Scylla did pursue,
She rest the Princes Purple lock,
and from her country flewe.
Her Brother beastly Byblis loved,
with Father Myrrha lay:
Semyramis that aged Queen
of Babylon (they say)
Her son King Ninus out of kind
did fancy (fleshly Dame:)
Eriphile at siege of Thebes
(to her eternal shame)
For golden Owch betrayde her Spouse
Amphiaraus hight:
King Danaus daughters did to death
their husbands in a night.
The Thracian Wives with cruel clu^bes
the Poet Orpheus rent:
Pasiphae that wanton Wench
(to work her foul intent)
In Mynos absence closde in Cow,
was couerde of a Bull:
Hippolit Phaedria went about
from honest life to pull.
Rebecca Isaac did deceive,
and blearde his aged eyes:
And hid the son that Jacob hight
in Goats long hairy flyse.
The curssed Deianira gave
unto her manly feere
The fatal venom, he (good man)
did bye the shirt to dear.
Hippodame beguylde her sire,
and stopped his vital breath
By match with Pelops, and procurde
thereby his hasty death.
Lauynia wrought the Trojans woe,
and bredde a broyle in field:
Her Turnus would have had to wife,
Aeneas would not yield.
Achilles chieftaine of the Greeks
from battle Brysis drove:
Duke Agamemnon all inragde
with Chrysis beauty brave
Did freate and fume in furious wise
and felt Apollos wrath:
And curssed Eve from blessed fields
mankind expelled has.
Believe me (Shephierdes) for I swear
by Gods that have the care
Of Country soil: If you will have
your Cattle well to fare,
Your Pastures fit for feeding Flocks
and wanting all disease,
If hooe you have of sheep, of peace,
of life and quiet ease:
Abandon all these foolish Girls,
let wanton Wenches go,
Do from your sheepcots shift away
all Women less and more.
Let Thestilis and Phillis walk,
bear Galathea grudge:
Force you Neera naught at all,
let fine Lycoris trudge.
Oh, make me show what woman ere
went down to darksome Hell,
And came from thence, or tidings brought
from such as there do dwell?
Eurydice might have returnde
if she had had the wit,
And come from shade to sun again,
to light from loathsome Pit.
Proserpine eke whom Pluto stole
and had conuayde away,
Her weary mother Ceres shunnde
with griefly King to stay.
But good Aeneas shapt retowre,
and Orpheus did the leeke:
Alcydes eke that Champion stout
and thrice renoumed Greek.
Duke Theseus and the brothers both,
of whom one quails his foes
With fight on horssebacke, the other aye
on foot to wrestling goes.
And our Redeemer, highest GOD,
whence life and comfort flows,
Went down to Hell, and rose again
as all the world knows.
These (Shephierds) these are mysteries
to be observed of you:
By nature Man and kind is bent
all filthy things t'eschue.
Infamous places most delight
and fancy Woman's mind.
Even as the Seaman driven on
the Rocks with wave and wind,
Knows how the dangers to declare
unto his other Mates:
So he f^ll well of former happes
and future chance debates,
And tells what Fortune will befall
by likelyhode at the least:
Whose wasted years have planted wit
within his aged breast.
If siellie Fowls the Eagle fly,
if Buckes the net do shun,
If bleaing Lambs avoid the Woulfe,
if Diere from Dog do run:
Then (Shephierd) oh why do not thou
from Woman's flattrie flee:
And trudge from her with speedy flight
that so anoyeth thee?
As ruthful they as Crocodile,
or beast Hyena hight.
The viler mischief they pretend
when to the outward sight
The deawe their cheeks with trickling tears,
and use their sweetest rall:
Then they conspire thy cruel death
(fell Monsters) most of all.
O Shephierd shun the Woman's look
and fly her fleering face:
For harling nets and hurtful ginnes
are pight in beauties place.
Repose no trust in manly force,
in prowess or in might,
Trust not Duke Perseus glittring shield
that made yt sturdy Knight
Of fell Medusas crawling Snakes
to bide the ugly sight.
Erst many Monsters have subdude
and ghastly Giants quelde:
Huge Cities sacked, and in their hands
whole Seas and Havens held.
With flowing fields and haughty hills
that seemde to touch the Sky:
And other some have won y^ spurs
for noble Chivalry.
Yet those that valiantly atchieude
and did these feats of fame
And conquerde all, a Woman has
(the more these Princes shame)
As Captives caught, and brought to yoke.
That Shephierd that was King,
And wore the Lions hairy spoil
and warrde with weakefull sling:
And eke his some that worthy Prince
King Solomon by name
The sacred Temple ( Syon clept)
who first of all did frame:
And Sampson he whom never man
could deal withal in field,
All these (I say) for all their force
to Woman's yoke did yield.
Less hurtes the fiery flashing flake,
less raggie Rocks anoy,
And less the Gleaue that Adam did
expel from heavenly joy:
Less spoils the spiteful steely Spear
and dreadful darte of Death,
That quite cuts off the line of life
and reaues the vital breath,
Than woman does our daily foe:
who never well content
With beauties beams y^ Nature gave,
does aye with care invent
A thousand means to make it more
and fairer to the eyes.
A golden glistring Fillet to
her forhead she applies,
With Purple hue her paalie cheeks
she paintes and daily dies.
By Art her locks she settes in place
and deckes and dils her pate:
By Art she tempers all her looks,
by Art she guides her gate.
She runs before with s^udding skips
the loving man to lure
And bring to place for folly fit:
although she look demure
And give the nay, with all her heart
she would on him bestow
His suite, she strives, but gladly would
be conquerde of the foe.
A Woman to the Northeast wind
may well compared be,
That gathers up the cloud and straight
does force the same to flee
Abroad by guilefull puff again
and bitter windy blast:
So she allures, and then she lowres
upon hi^ Love at last.
By trial I that find it true
do will thee to beware
(Whilst yet thou may) the loathsome tricks
that in these Women are.
But homely they by nature are,
by Art they waxen brave:
By day it is all the work they do,
their dreams thereof they have.
They pluck off hairs where need requires,
they wash, they paint and sleeke:
They cham^er, purle, anoint and smooth
and practice other leeke.
Deceyte they are from top to toe,
all craft and trifling toys:
All stufft with venom rank and vile,
that gazers on anoyes.
Of Glass she takes her counsel aye
for ought she puts in ure:
By view thereof she learues to move
her lips and looks de^^re.
She learnes to craft by gaze of Glass,
to smyle with flattring gloss:
She wags her hench that hangs behind
and shoulders as she goes.
What means that bare and naked breast
and open clyft a hie
That makes the double path be^wixt
the dangling Dugs to lie?
Naught else (good faith) but for y^ force
of poison should oppress
The Sense the more, and Stygian flame
within the heart increase.
These are the Rocks of retchlesse Age,
and Syrts that threaten wrack:
These Scyllas and Charybdes are
the cords of Youth to crack.
These are y^ Fowls that Harpeis hight
that with their fylth deftle
The chamber, parler, board and streafe,
and makes the temple^vile,
Pollute the path, the Champion fields,
the Sea, the flood, the hill,
These ghastly Gorgons are that erst
in Lybie land did kill,
And that with monstrous glowing looks
to Stones did men conuarte,
And wrested Nature from her kind
by cruel curssed Art.
Thus by the way (as you have heard)
the learned Vmbers verse
Recy^ed is, and we are they
that did the Ryme rehearse.
Which if you deem excessive long,
remember that the blame
Is in she thing it self, the Verse
does not deserve the same.
The Verse is not so long, as is
these Women's frantic fit.
O noble aged famous wight
(of wha^e for worthy wit
The boasting Vmbria brags and vauntes,
and Tyber neighbor place
Thereto) 'twas not without desert
that Martial Roman race
Of thee accounted erst so well:
The noble City knew
Thy passing wit and pleasant vain.
The learned Muses rue
Both Greeks and Latins thy decease.
I wish thy corpse in grave
With ease to lie, and golden soul
in Skies his seat to have.

The.v. Egloge entitled CANDIDVS.
The Argument.
SI^uanus seems to muse
at Poets idle life:
Himself not over hasty yet
by gift to ease their grief.
But Candid (Poet poor)
bewailes the present time:
Wherein the Learned loathed are,
and such as maken Rhyme.
Siluanus wealthy was
well storde of stuff at home:
But careful Candid want of goods
enforcde abroad to rome.
But yet for all his toil
and travail long sustaynde:
For all his learned vain in Verse
no whit this Poet gaynde.
Which makes the man the more
against wealthy wights to war:
For somewhat he deserude to find
that trauaylde had so far.
The speakers names.
Siluanus. Candidus.
Siluanus. O Candid, thou ere this
did use a common trade,
With us to feed thy flock a field
and Pipe in pleasant shade.
To chat in merry wise,
and wrestle now and than:
But now me thinks thou art become
another kind of man.
As though thou did both loath
the Shephierdes and their soil:
Thou fleest the fields, and scornst to sing,
a sleepie dumpish droile.

Candidus. You that at home have store
of goodly household stuff,
Whose Kie have dangling Vdders down
and morning Milk ynouffe:
Whose flocks do fill the paile
even to the upper brimme,
Whose Hierds do make y^ crooked Cans
with whashing whay to swim:
Whose boord^s with Bankets brave
and fattie Feasts do reake,
In commendation of a Verse
and praise of Poets speak.
If ought be well deuisde
you give a cheerful cry:
And to the hearing of the same
a pleasant ear apply.
Vain praise and painted words
in recompense you give:
Meanewhile y^ shepherd hunger sterude*
in thirst and cold does li^e.

Siluanus. Can he not both attend
his flock, and otherwhile
At vacant time make Verses, and
all cankred cares exile?
And wast his days in sport,
and lead his life at lust
As best contents his liking mind?

Candidus. No (friend) a Shephierd must
All laysure time unto
his Cattle well implie,
Trot out in have, return in poast,
and bout his matters hie:
Keep off the barking Woulfe,
close up his flock in fold,
Buie straw and fodder to sustain
his Beasts from Winter cold:
For meat and drink puruey,
no leisure time remains.
A Verse it is a stately thing
and craves a cruel pains,
And all the brain ( Siluanus) beats,
and stirring Senses strains.
Both these are weighty works
and overmuch for me:
When I have soong I am full dry,
my lips ypartched be,
And no man gives me drink:
some other scoff a good,
And say, me thinks your cloak is thin,
your hair grows through your hood:
Your hose are cracked at knee,
your bearde is bristled sore.
Now naked Trees vnuested are,
the frostie hills are hoar.
I chaufe, I sorrow eke,
and daily do disdain:
The cost of needful cates consumes
and wears away my gain,
Both Wool and Cattle male.
We keep the females aye,
But for they fostred are with milk
we make nor cheese nor whaye,
They dry the strouting Tets.
It yrks me of my wit
(If any lodge within my Skull)
and skill a Verse to writ.
It loathes me of my life
this cruel chance to see,
That none of all the shining Stars
is friendly light to me.
Thou wotist full well that I
for naught these many days
Have soong, I wanted few good things
as then: now Youth decays,
And limping Age is at
another kind of stay
Which now encrocheth on apace,
it reaues our wealth away.
Then strength begins to fail,
no lucres hope remains.
Then must we use our gotten goods,
and wast our coffred gaynes.
Wherefore now time requires
and bids us look about:
See how the Ant a little beast
(I put thee out of doubt)
But circumspect and wise,
in Summer drags to Cave
And hides the Grain in hole, his life
in Winter time to save.
And, least the Corn should sproute
and so escape his might,
The buried grain with greedy mouth
this siellie Beast does bite.

Siluanus. They say there are that know
what Fortune shall betide
By Stars that rule at time of birth,
and they do thus decide.
The Poets they were wont
to Mercure to assign,
And noble Peers are under Jove
whose sovereign Scepters shine.
Them mighty Jove allows
the Gold and Kingly seat:
Mercurius gives those other wit,
tongue, harp and Verses feate.
That is thy lotted hap,
why do thou gape for pelf?
God does dystribute needful things
as he does see himself
What is for our avail:
wherefore accept thy share
And live content, resign the rest
to us that wealthy are.

Candidus. Thou riches have at will,
I Verse and Poets trade:
Why crau'st thou then my Verse, and do
another bowndes invade?

Siluanus. I reaue thee not thy Muse,
nor ought that 'Phoebus gave:
But to thy Music for to lend
an ear, is all I crave.

Candidus. Then if thou long so much
to hear my pleasant voice,
( Siluanus) reason is, that with
thy wealth I should rejoice.

Siluanus. He at my wealth does joy
that loves both me and mine:
The spiteful man hates me, and at
my welfare does repine.

Candidus. Yea, then as well thou may
in absence take delight
Enough of this my Muse, and so
thy friendship I requite.
For Verses are the feast
and iuncket of the ear,
Cheese serves to feed the tasting jaws
in stead of better cheer.
Wherefore if thou desire
to feast thine ears with sound:
Then set my chaps a work with cates,
for so thou stand bound
By love, and law of God,
so pity does persuade.
God gives not al his gifts to one,
but in such sort has made
His laws of kind, that none
can find suffising power
Within him self to serve his turn,
but at some needful hour
He stands in want of help
and of some foreign aid:
And that is it that does conioyne,
and ever yet has stayde
In league of lasting love
all kinds of foreign wightes:
The French, the Maure, the Italian, and
the worthy Spanish Knights.
Then let us join yfeare,
and lincke at last in one
Those stars that at each others birth
and day of being shone.
Cause Jupiter to be
my faithful friend at need,
And thou shall have Mercurius help
if he may stand in steed.
Thou shall not want his Hat,
his twigge, or Lute to play:
Alcydes knot thou shall command,
which few can tell the way
Or none at all to looze,
so doubtful is the drift:
Yea whisking wings and all thy limbs
into the Skies to lift.

Siluanus. Good faith, me thinks thou telst
a vain and trifling tale:
Your ouermany words declare
your tongue is tipped with Ale.
You count it vain that does
your riches wrong a whit.
But if to hear my merry Muse
you have so great delight:
Do ease my drousie dumpes,
and mist of careful mind:
For Verses crave a quiet breast
and joyful heart by kind.
I woxen am of late
much like the skirring Kite,
Whom cruel cold and hunger cloyes,
a slow unlusty wight.
All scaly is my Skin,
my lips are passing dry:
For lack of licour at my need
I am at point to die.
In stable not a Beast,
in cloase no Corn to see:
No cross in pouch, and would y^ have
me void of care to be?
Such Physike does not serve
nor sitting is to ease
Me (stellie Miser) of my grief
and gryping foul disease.
Make merry me, do cloth
my bare and naked bones,
Relieve my Age, and thou shall see
me making Verse atones:
I out of hand will sing
and pipe in pleasant wise.
A house that stored is with wealth
where trash and treasure lies,
Does cruel cares exile
and banish dumpes away.
A Sellar full, Foldes stuffed with flocks,
Pots full as ere they may:
A Flaggon full to brimme,
as much as it can hold,
Barn full, fat Cattle, and a Pursse
puffed up with peysing Gold,
These make the merry mind.
Then pleasant it is to wake
The Winter nights, and with a stick
at fires side to make
Good sport with streking of
the Ashes furrowise:
And roast the Chestnutte that yrakt
in scalding imber lies.
And with an alie Cruse
the cruel thirst to quell,
And pleasant tales among a route
of spinning Trulls to tell.
For Vergil (by report)
Mecoenas bearing sway,
The Country, Oxen, ^oyle and eke
the Martial wars did splay
Aloft in lusty tune,
and struck with stately Verse
The starry Skies, his Music did
the haughty Heavens pierce.
Good luck and store of wealth
allowde him fluent vain:
Us stellie, poor and patched souls
the Muses do disdain.
To us that Gruell suppe
with greedy gaping gum,
As lean as rakes, the God of skill,
Apollo scorns to come.

Siluanus. O friend if hoped hap
suffising wealth allow
To me, I will procure release
of cares that cl^y thee now.

Candidus. Siluanus would thy will
did counteruaile thy might,
And thou were bent as well as thou
art able me to quite
From present poor estate.
I neither long to have
The fluent wealth of Co^^s, it is
no silken cloak I crave.
No roabe of Purple stain
or Die that came from Tire,
Nor costly cates of mighty Kings,
nor Bankets I desire.
Not Aesops dainty dish
or warlike ^Pallas shield,
Nor battled buildings raised hie
that Roman ^ero held.
(I mind it well that I
of Vmber learned this)
I crave attire and vittailes in
a thacched Coat ywis.
So that I were assurde
of that till life did blinne:
Give me ^Pythagors homely fare,
and Codrus garments thin.
I often times have had
the hap to hit on such
That offered have to me ere this
in painted words as much,
But naught they did in deed:
my hope consistes in thee
Alone, and in none other man.
If thou once false with me,
Quite off is cut my hope:
with Nightingall I may
Shut up my Pipes till next return
of Spring, and leave my lay,
As one withouten speech:
then wil^t be time to (...)
My weapon on the poast, and watch
dischargde, the door to shut.

Siluanus. O Candid thou at Rome
ere this (I know) have been:
The sacred Senate there thou have
and holy Fathers seen.
Where are so many States
and store of learned brains,
There may a man enritch him soon,
there restes the Poets gaynes.

Candidus. No sure, thou art begylde,
thou think I long for pelf:
So weenes the Woulfe that other eat
the meat he mowthes him self.
And thou haste this conceyte
that other tread the way
And cross the path that thou do pace,
thus do thou seem to say.
A pittance would suffize,
I covet not to flow:
O let me live withouten care,
the Roman Court I know.
O ( Siluan) what auayles
that place so poor a Wight?
Augus^^^ (...) ago is dead,
in dampe or darksome night
He woons and stays in Hell.
If Rome do ought expende.
^Tis trif^es, Rome receyues the gold,
and words for ware does lend.
Alas, for now alone
at Rome does money reign:
Dame VER^VE lives a weary life,
e^^lde she bydes the pain.
Each man does bid us hope
and look for good at last:
We gnawe on Trust, ^tis slender food,
we were as good to fast.

Siluanus. Display some dreadful field,
pen acts of worthy Peers,
Write wreakefull War^s of wrathfull^ Kings:
repair to such as steeres
And are the stay of Realms,
and wielde the princely Mace:
Thou shall have luck to light on some
that pity will thy case.

Candidus. T^sh, sooner shall I find
a check or scossing taunt:
Of Poets men as much account
as stews they daily haunt.
Why then ( Siluanus) do
thou stir my chaused wit?

Siluanus. Such filthy words to speak it is
not for a Poet fit.

Candidus. I can none other choose
but very sooth to say:
But if thou feign would have y^ truth
to be concealde, do stay
Thy tongue from moving me,
and leave while things be well.

Siluanus. What it is not one to stir to wrath,
and good advice to tell.

Candidus. Of counsel I am storde,
my budget is but bare:
How should a needy Poet Wars
and kingly Camps declare?
That has not once so much
good here below the Sun,
As knife to cut his Pipe, and cause
the breath by holes to run?
Behold the handle of
my Whittle how it waggs
By looseness of the pinnes: see how
the edge is all in iaggs
And toothed like a saw:
but these are slender things,
The lack of meat and drink is it
that me so vilely wrings.
Good counsel somewhat mends
the matter when it cooms:
But that advice that fruitelesse is
our shaken Senses nooms.
It breaks the busy brain,
it weakes the weary wit.
For Peers small friendships to bestow
me thinks is nothing fit:
And they do flat refuse
great guerdens to forgo.
Besides our Princes now a days
account of Verses so,
As Borias blast of leaves,
with wh^ff^ng force that sly:
Or Lybicke wind with stormy pusse
that on the Seas does lie.
As frost does force the V^ne
whom cruel it does cut.
The ^esars they their tickling joys
in sweet delights so put,
(Unmindful of their states)
and idle life embrace:
As Verses they will none that seem
their vices to deface.
Thence slow the wanton Rymes,
this makes that Poets now
Of childish Venus chat so often
they wotte near what nor how:
Of tauntes and scolding scoff,
of beastly belly cheer,
Of sluggish trade, infamous acts,
which too reproachful were
And vile offense for one
that honest is to write.
But those that erst with hardy hand,
and courage stout did fight,
That used valiant arms
and dealt with deadly blade,
Not glutted with the greedy Gold,
have more of Poets made:
And lou^d the lofty Muse
and Verse of stately style.
Those Martial Kings that foylde y^ foe
with haughty hand erewhile,
Extolde the haughty Pen
that did their battails blase:
But straight as soon as warlike wights
and Virtue fled the place,
The Poets could not write,
Invention fainted thoe:
The learned lost their brains, the flood
of Versing wared low,
To wrack went worthy works.
If now a days of fame
Be any living that by wars
has got a gallant name:
He forces naught at all
of after comers praise,
Renoume of foreign land he scorns
content with present days,
(Quite glutted with good fame)
and laud that they allow,
Whom he does hourly see with eye
and viewes with daily browe.
A savage man outright
he loves no learned skill,
Or else of much desired gold
can never have his fill:
But drowned lies in mucke
and filthy Metals mire,
Quite crushed with cares as Mydas was
with greedy goldes desire.
Besides with Princes are
a rude and rusticke route,
A spiteful sect: The flattring guest,
the counterfaiting Loute
Whose iestures maken glee,
the baudie merchaunt eake,
And he, that what so ere he says,
to please the ear does speak.
Then he that plays on Stage,
the iangling Iester to:
Next him y^ mate that hunts y^ Whore,
and other thousands more
That hate the Poet, and
are Virtues deadly foes:
Expel him from the Princes Court.
Much like as when the Crows
Have loathsome Carraine found
and see the Carcas lie:
They drive from thence both Foul and Beast,
not letting them come nie.
Again some Poets are
so out of wreason rash,
As (blockish beasts) they dare to make
too fond and soolish trash.
And all to feed the ears
and humors of the Peers,
Yea such as force no whit of ^ame.
For Poets eke there steeres
A kind of frantic mood
and madness of the brains:
These (but I wotte not what it is
that thereunto constraynes)
Will Poets be in have
and taken so abroad,
As soon as once they have in Pipe
of h^^elow Hemlocke blowde.
Well think they of them selves,
upon their books they bost
Vile Fools and sielly Sotts untaught,
not fit to rule the roast:
Foreseeyng naught at all
foreright and witless men.
Who so accustomde is to lend
an ear unto their Pen
And foolish tedious tales,
do deem there is no choice,
But all are wise alike: and this
is it that ba^res the vo^ce
Of learned men in deed,
for that he knows not how
To judge the better from the worsse,
(...) from the Sow.
O C^ndid. I protest

Siluanus. by Heavenly powers on hie,
And haughty Gods of Olympe hill
that wi^ld she scudding Sky:
That I (if on my sails
there light a blessed blast)
Will seek to further thee in tin^e,
and be thy help at last.
Meanewhile content thy self
and champe on hope with me:
Till better fortune shall allow
my friendlier fates to be.

Candidus. If so thou mean me well,
I wish thee like again.

Siluanus. Yes faith with all my heart and mind,
the proof shall make it plain,
Within a little space.

Candidus. Farewell thou churlish Chuffe,
Pray God thou never may return
that never have ynouffe.
Would all thou handlest might (as Mydas did of yore)
Be Gold, for cause thou setst of Gold
more than of Virtue store.

The.vj. Egloge entitled CORNIX.
The Argument.
How Country differs from the Town
here Cornix he recites:
He girdes the foolish sotted Sects,
and against the witless writes.
The speakers names.
Cornix. Fulica.
Cornix. THe wrathful Winter snowes,
fell Boreas blasts do blow,
The ysicles from houses hang:
The man that erst did sow
And tillde his stony soil,
has let a field his plowe,
And takes his ease: the weary ground
it self does slumber now.
The Shephierd having shut
his doors, and caught his cloak
Keeps house: Neaera eke does sit
at home in smothering smoke
At Chimnie nooke, and plies
her pottage Pot apace:
^arst Summer for his scalding heat,
(when Summer was in place)
That was so much myslikte,
is now commended sore:
And Winter hated is of us
for whom we wished before.

Fulica. All present pleasure we
but little worth esteem,
Surpassyng that which is to come (the hoped good) we deem:
Even so the farther off the light
the more the light does seem.

Cornix. Each Tune and ery Age
his pleasure bryngs with it:
See how the Country boys unkempt
in patched garments knit,
Rejoice at slaughter time
when Piggs do go to Pot,
They fill the Bladder full of Beans,
and having tide a knotte
They rattell it a good:
an other whiles withal
Close ^^sted they their Elbows join
and soote the flying ball.
And thus the Winter cold
with trottyng here and there,
And frosty time with cour^^ng of
the Country ball they wear.
Yet we far better here
in Chimnies like to burn
Istretcht in Straw, do wast the time
whilst milk to crudde does turn.

Fulica. The Winter does forshew
the poor and needful plight.
We youths are such a retchlesse route
as do not wey a white
The aftertime to come:
In Summer careless we
Do lead our lives not minding what
the Winter is wont to be,
And all our pence the Piper has
for making merry glee.
When Borias makes return
from Scythian frosty bound
And bared trees with battred boughs
and leaves ylayde in ground
Bewray where byrds have bredde
and hatched their chickens erst:
Poor naked souls our shoulders, back,
ribbs, feet with cold are pierst.
Our foli^e Winter wries,
more wise the Townish be,
That heap their hoordes of wealth at home
furrde down beneath y^ knee.
The Fox the belly wraps,
the stomach gardes the Sheep:
With help of speckled Libart eke
away the cold they keep.
We Country men are Sottes

Cornix. and Fools of erie age,
But not alone we witless are:
for why a madder rage
In Citizens does reign.
But Lady FORTUNE is
A Damme to them, she seems to us
a Mother law ywis.
This Stepdamme stern does deal
with us in cruel sort:
They now a days are coumpted mad
that bear the baser port.
But once allow me wealth,
let me have riches store:
Then I am best in all the town,
I shall go all before.
Then will my tale be heard,
I shall be masterd aye:
Then crook they knees, the caps go off,
and mark what ever way
I pass, the people crouch:
my counsel then they seek
Both poor and rich, the wealthy snudge,
the saged Fathers eke.

Fulica. O Cornix, it is not Chance
that breeds this Wit in Man,
But it is the mind: nor maken us
this Fortune wealthy can.
It Is God that gives the goods
as erst Amyntas said:
It Is easy riches to attain
if he do stand our aid.

Cornix. Nay Fortune is a God,
no doubt thereof I have.
But what was it Amyntas told?
of thee his tale I crave.
For he was known a man
of quick and sharper brain
Than diverse are, wherefore I would
hear his good verdite feign.
But yet before thou have
that wise discourse begun:
Unto the Foldes to see our Flocks
I pray thee ( Fulike) run.
Trudge, and return in haste,
for after cold (thou know)
A fit of heat more welcome is,
pack and retire in post.

Fulica. Up to my knee does reach
the thick vnthawed snow,
Scarce houses bear the weight ^^erof:
the Oven that bakes the dowe,
Has at the very top
great lumpes thereof that lies,
And up into a picked point
it clymes in Pilier wise.

Cornix. Fill up the Rack with hay
that came of latter share:
Do stop the elouen clif^s with straw,
if so the walls do stare
Or gape in any place:
and ere thou hither come,
Besmeare the thresholde round about
with slime and bullock lome.
For nothing more annoyes
or banes a Beast than cold.
What? art thou com? what means this have?
it is more than use of old.

Fulica. Fie, Winter nippes me sore,
this frost does make me frette:
The greatest comfort in the earth
is, both in cold and heat,
To hug in reakyng hay,
and when the cold is past
In stiflyng straw to stretch our stumps
and limbs on mow to cast.

Cornix. Go to, be^yn to tell
how Town and Country trade
Do swerve, the odds display thou here.

Fulica. Thus good Amyntas made
The diffrence twixt these two.
What time the world began Narrati^

And things as yet were newly framde,
then GOD did link a Man
With woman aye to live,
and marride them yfeare
He willde the Man to get the Babes,
the Woman babes to bear:
And taught them how they should
their children eke beget.
At first they ^^yde their business well,
and did their taske^set.
Would so they had done still,
and let the fruit alone:
And never tasted of that tree
the Apple grew upon.
The Woman wore a dame,
both Boy and Wench she bore:
And yearly so by like increase
with men the earth did store.
When fiftene years were past,
GOD came again that way
And there he found the Woman whilst
she began her babes array.
Him she dyscride a far,
as she at thresholde sat.
(This while was Adam gone a field
this Woman's wedded Mate.
He careless fed his flock,
as then was no mystrust
Of falshode twixt the man and wife.
But when that growing lust
Made many marri'ge knots:
then false they began to play,
They knocked the Goat about the pate
and reft his horns away
To graffe on Husbands head:
then jealous seed begone
To take his root in Husbands breast,
he doubted of his Son.
For men that false a boorde
themselves are wont to play,
Mystrust their wives will go about
their ancient debtes to pay.)
Herewith the Mother blushed,
and bare her self in hand
So many babes would overmuch
against his liking stand,
And make her be suspect
of too much wanton lust:
She ran and hid me some in hay,
and some in chafe she thrust.
In came the mighty GOD,
and having blessed the place
Said: Woman fetch me all thy babes
that I may see their face.
The Mother brought the biggst
and let the lesser lie:
GOD likt them well. As men are wont
(as daily proof does try)
Of Fowls and senting Hounds
to like the eldest best.
First to the senior of his Sons
thus spoke the GOD and blessed.
Take thou this kingly Mace, supply a Resars room:
Unto the second brother Arms,
and made him Mars his groom.
Be thou a Duke (quod he)
and daunt thy foes in fight:
And then at last he shewde out Rods
and Axe to open sight,
With Twigs of tender Vine
and noble Romai^e dar^e:
And Offices began deal about
to every Babe a part.
Wherewith the Mother glad
to see her Sons ex^o^de,
Ran in, and fetched out all her brood,
and said: Thou God behold
These are my belly fruit,
these in my womb I bare
As well as those: vouchsafe to let
these have some part of share.
Their bristled pates were white
with chafe, the straw it hoong
About their arms, and spider webbs
that to the wattles cloong.
Those likte him naught at all
not one he fanside well,
But frowning said: Auaunt you Gi^es,
of mow and mould you smell.
Take you the goryng Goade
and country punchyng prick:
Take you the spitting Spade in hand,
and Garden setting stick.
To you the Culter longs,
the Yoke and other trash:
You shall be Ploughmen, Carters yo^,
with Whip to give the lash.
You shall be Shephi^rdes you,
haycutters, delue the soil:
You shall be Seamen, Cowardes eke,
turmoilde with endless toil.
But yet among you all
we do appoint that some
Shall leave the clownish Country life
and to the Town shall come.
As Puddingmakers, Cooks,
the Butchers, Piewiues eake:
And other such like sluttish Arts
of whom I do not speak:
That wonted are to sweat
and at the Coals to burn,
Like Drudges wasting all their days
to serve their masters turn:
This done, the mighty GOD
departed from the Skies.
Thus twixt the Town and Country did
the difference first arise.
Thus were the Clowns ymade, as good
Amyntas does devise.

Cornix. If he had ought said well
I would have marueld much:
He was a Townish man, and they
do ever bear a grutch
And byte with bitter scoff
us poor and Country souls,
It Is all the work they have to do,
aye us the Town controls.
Yea, they will nothing shame
against the Gods to jest,
Devising trifles like to this.
Art thou so plain a gest
And stuffed with Pudding so
and have thy belly full,
As that thy self art toutcht herein
can never pierce thy skull?
This nippe is even a taunt:
but let us for a space
Unto the follies of the Town
convert our Country face,
And judge of all their deeds:
least thou surmize perhaps
That they are wyser unto whom
the people veil their caps:
And such as daily go
in Gold and Purple weed,
Than we that homely Rustickes are
and simple men in deed.
I sundry times have seen
men cladde in costly gear
Like Princes bout the Market square
and ietting here and theare:
Quite hungersteru'd at home
and Kitchins void of Cooks,
As poor as Job, when all was weyd^
for all their lofty looks.
What folly more than this?
to bear of wealth a face,
And be a needy Beggar yet
for all the painted case?
Men but beguile themselves
in using this devise.
Yea more than that, my self have seen
the Office fathers wise
That bear the only sway
(O vile and filthi^ crime)
Whilst they themselves will live at ease
and leudly waste the time:
Set out their wives to hire
and daughters to be sold:
What can be worsse? or fowler fact?
what more to be controlde?

Fulica. Put case they can not find
another way to live?

Cornix. No? did not GOD as many hands
and other Senses give
To them, as unto us?
yes. Then I pray thee tell
The very reason ( Fulick) why
they can not live as well?
Nay, more than that are some
that practice daily feate
To come by wealth by vain devise
as never man could get.
With juice of sappie herbs
they rub and burnish Brass,
In hope to make it Gold in time,
and bring their wills to pass
In wresting Nature clean
and changing kind by skill:
They puff the coals in pensive care
with swarth and smoakie gyll.
Another studies hard
and plies inchauntments sore,
In hope to find some hidden vain
of Gold, unknown before
That lurkes in dampe of ground
and hollow Vault below,
And plays the Witch, but nothing gains
as proof does plainly show.
What vainer toye than this?
what leude or lighter jest?
Because they would avoid the ploughmans
life that is the best,
They practice every feate,
attempting every thing:
They often begin, but never ought
to good effect can bring.
They ever turn and wend
and keep a daily coile,
To keep them from the careful Carte
and tilling of the soil.
By Money loan and Use
of filthy Fulckers trade,
(That Usury may well be termde)
infamous shifts be made.
They practice force and fraud,
and double dealing aye:
They lay their wily hooks for wealth,
devising day by day
A mean to mount to state
and Honors tickle throne.
Whilst we Sheep, Goats and flocks do f^ede
and let such tricks alone:
They keep their sowring Hawks,
they foster barcking Hounds,
They have their footecloth Nags to ride
about their Pasture grounds.
Of Munkies much they make
and other Apish toys:
This is the only trade they use,
these are the Townish joys.
The Rusticke Cattle keeps,
the Townsman Currs and Kites:
I pray thee judge which is the best
of theirs or our delights?
Which most with Worship stands?
which brings the greater game?

Fulica. If so our trade be bett' than theirs,
then how should they attain
Such store of stamped Coin,
and Riches as they have?
How come they by that dainty fare?
how by those garments brave?

Cornix. How man? By slipper craft,
by pelting pilfring shifts:
By subtle fetches of the mind,
by double devilish driftes.
What (madman) do not see
how us they daily wring
In cruel wise? If of our words
(a vile and beastilie thing)
They take advantage once
and catch us in a trippe:
We shall be sure to feel the smart
and bide the lashing whippe.
They deem a godly deed
to take us in the snare:
And this is all their whole devise,
their study and their care.

Fulica. Why? How befalls that thou
the City know so well?

Cornix. How? This I learned erst while I
my milk was wont to sell,
And had my female Goats
within the City wall,
I oasted at a Bakers house,
he knew their manners all.
He was a crafty Child,
and with his iron would
Go cut the doawe, and nip the loaves
when Maidens began to mould.
He, as he wist their wile
and knew their crafty trade,
Said, that the City was a Hell.
A whole discourse he made
Of their unthrifty lives
that in the town did won:
And told me, that to filtch at first
himself had there begone.
In Cities other are
with beastly baudie rule
That wast the wealth their Grandsires gave
and plying of the Cule.
They have their minion Trulls
and wanton fleshly Froes:
Oh, what more filthy can be found
than is the life of those?
(Pray) where is Whordome used?
Manslaughter and Uproar?
Bear these in Cities not the sway,
and ever did of yore?
Where lodge those Kings that seek
their Crowns by loss of blood?
And force their subjects to the death
that in their quarrel stood?
Where wo^ne the warly wights
that with such desperate hearts
Object themselves to fearful foe
and dint of deadly darts?
For slender wages they
do hazard life and all:
What madness more tha^ theirs that so
do seek for sudden fall?
Of life they less account
than of a blast of fame.
And what is glory, praise, or laud?
what Worship? Honors name?
What giddie peoples voice
and brute of foolish brains?
All dies and wears away with time,
death all this trumperie stains,
All suddenly do flitte
as light when Sun does dim.
And they that having wealth at Land
upon the Surge will swim,
And leave their Country coast
are folish wights I trow:
He wants his wits that will af^ie
in winds and water so.
Who so has store of wealth
and uses not the same,
Is mad I think: But yet of all
that man is most to blame
That lives a Misers life
and ouerharde does fare,
And heaps his treasure in a hoorde
and all for Son to spare:
And leaves the thing undone
(which he might compass well)
For children that shall after come
when he is dead in Hell.
All such as number stars
and meddle with the Skies,
And those that calke the days of birth,
and think they can comprise
By skill to scan the fate
to man that shall betide,
Are very fools: But from his wits
yet he is farther wide
The nature of the Gods
that does ensearch to know,
And dares upon so great a light
his little eyes to throw.
Far better is our faith:
for Townsmen ever look
To have a Reason, else they will
scarce credit any book.
Bare words we soon believe
that are of Country stamp,
And at the sacred Altar set
up many a light and Lamp.
The Cytizens are hard
of faith, and never blinne
To search the secrets of the Gods:
whom if it were no sin
To descant of so much,
but that we ought to know
Their natures, then themselves they might
unto our Senses show.
But since they would have
their secret kind unknown:
What mean we to enquire of Gods
and let them not alone?
Our charity besides
the Townish zeal exceedes.
For holy men that serve the Church
and wear the sacred weeds,
What store of meat get they
which go from place to place,
Of us that in the Country dwell
within a little space?
I Bargeis lode have seen
of Grain and goodly Corn
Brought from the country to y^ town,
we aye such zeal have borne.
Another sect of Sottes
and foolish men there are:
As pett^e Foggers, barking Buggs
and Pleaders at the bar,
Well skilde to scrape for coin
even Tirants in their trade:
For fee they sell their helping hand,
for money they are made
The wrongful case to plead:
they make their chiefest gain
By letting Causes longer hang
than need or law constrain
Within the cruel Court
where matters are to hear,
And what at one Court day might end,
they linger on a year.
Physicians eke there are
from place to place that ride
On Mullets, that full often strike
the veins that are denide,
And minister amiss,
and for dyseases frame
(Whose kind they never knew before
a certain term and name.
And they (though Art they want
and lack good Physics skill)
Have lawful leave to vere the sick,
yea Patientes eke to kill.
And those that Office bear
and swinge the chiefest sway,
The more authority they have
the more they run astray.
The madder waxen they
once placde in Rulers room.
O, what of holy Governors
and Fathers is becoome,
Of whom our Elders erst
by fire sitting told?
Now all is gone to spiteful wrack
that has been seen of old.
The Temples are defaste,
the poor do make complaint,
The widows weep and wring their hands
with too much grief attaint.
And what should be the cause
that things are at this hand?
The only reason is for that
that Lust for Law does stand.

Fulica. Fie ( Cornix) fle, your rage
beyond all reason goes:
Thou all men do condemn alike.
What (man) thou must suppose
That of the Townish some
are good, in City dwell
Some honest men that lead their lives
and get their riches well.
I have forgot the name,
but sure thereof I stand,
Nie Balearia lives no Snake,
all venom voides the land.
No Owl in Creta cries,
no Horse of Gelding runs
On mount Aegeria: nor no ho-nest
man in City wunnes.

Fulica. An honest man is scarce,
in Country and in Town:
And virtue is as rare a thing
as any may be foune.

Cornix. O Fulick thou art mad,
that takst their party so:
Each one that in the City dwells
is thy undoubted foe.
They shave us close to skin,
they pill and make us bare:
They force us first to filtch, and then
our necks they do not spare.
They wey not they a whit
though we to Gallows go,
They tie us up in hampring cord
on tree to feed the Crow.
If we have ought that likes
their fancy or their lust,
They think to wring it from our hands,
it is both good and just.
They pluck away our plumes
and feathers one by one:
They never linne to scrape our goods
till all our wealth be gone.
Which if we chance to see,
excuses then are had:
But so we see not when it is done,
they will deny like mad
They never took away
one jot but was their own:
No wrong they do esteem the Theft
to be that is unknown.
Thus all the wealth they have
and mucke that lies in mow
By our sustained toil they gat
and sweat of painful browe.

Fulica. Nay, now you far exceed
the bounds of mean and right.

Cornix. O Fulicke, Townish shameful prancks
infect the world quite.
What makes in Summer time
so many rotten shoures?
Such thundering flakes, wind, floods and hail,
as from the Heaven poures?
I yet remember I
have seen the ground to quake:
The haughty roofes of houses fall,
and Pillerpostes to shake:
The Sun obscurde with dark
amid the shining day:
And in the night the Moon ydimde
and Starrelight taken away.
How chaunst that stinking weeds
the grain do over g^e,
And wild and barraine Oats oppress
the hoped Harvest so?
How hapt the Goat inuades
and tramples down the Vine?
That smelling flours in spring are spilt,
and Garden goods do pine?
All these mistehappes by mean
of civil Townish ill
Befall: and more in time (I fear)
thereby such myschieues will.
Whence come these rash vproares?
whence springs this battails broile,
That brings with it all kind of plagues
that so annoy the soil?
The City is the head
and Fountain whence it flows.
Lycaon he that cruel Woulfe
(whom all the wordle knows)
From City did discende:
Deucalion (with his make
Good Pyrrha) was a Countrieman.
'Twas for Lycaons sake
That all the earth was drownde,
Deucalion peasde the wave:
Lycaon murthred many men,
Deucalion man did save:
He took them from the earth,
this brought them life again.
If ever Fire should wast the world
(as some affirm it plain)
That mischief shall descend
from Town and City sure:
Their vile and filthy living will
those cruel plagues procure.

Fulica. O Cornix, leave to talk,
I hear the boys to call
For pottage, (lest I be deceiude)
if ought be left, it shall
At after dinner be
debated and discust:
Now let us plie the paunch, the hour
declares to meat we must.

The.vij. Egloge entitled POLLVX.
The Argument.
HEre Galbula extols
the Shephierds to the Sky:
And tells how Pollux did conuer^
that saw the Saint with eye.
The speakers names.
Alphus. Galbula.
WHat think thou Galbula? sir Pollux passing fine
In piping erst (I wotte not how)
inspirde with power divine
Forwent his Pipe, his Weed,
his charge of Beasts, his Mates,
And hooded (as the Lapwings are
with crists upon their pates)
Four days ago himself
to holy house did yield.
Some think that whilst his flock he fed
alone in open field,
He saw some godly shape
from Heaven to appear,
(The rest I have forgot) but what
think thou? I long to hear.
Galbula. As Sages said, when God
each creature began to make,
(No trifles I will tell, but such
of yore as Vmber spoke)
Both Clownish country wights
and Shephierdes he ordainde:
The Tylman tough, vnmilde, in civil
nurture never trainde,
Much like the lumpish clay
that Culter does control:
The Shephierd of a softer kind
a sielly hurtlesse soul.
As simple as the Sheep,
deuoide of wrathful gall,
The Sheep that yelds the milk, and likes
his keeper aye withal.
From flock to Altar he
would bring when so he came
Sometime a Sheep, a fatted Calfe,
sometime a sucking Lamb.
To Gods their honor due
he gave with good intent:
His service so preuailde with them,
he so their Godheads bent,
As since the time the world
created was and made,
Unto this hour most grateful was
to Gods the Shephierds trade.
And more than this, he callde
Assyrians a sort,
(Their names through care I have forgot
to Mace and Kingly port,
That Shephierds were before:
who garnisht brave in Gold
And purple roabes, proud countries often
in battle have controlde.
That Paris that beheld
three Goddesses in I Would,
With Paris eke the Sire that would
have forced his son to have did,
A Shephierd was. When Moy
ses fearde with heavenly fire
Came barefoote through the fields to see
the sign with great desire,
A shephierd then he was
and lately come from flood.
Apollo (as a bannisht man)
in Greece did think it good
His Godhead laid aside
a Shephierds charge to take,
And so the Amphrisian fields to walk
and Bow and shafts forsake.
Those sacred Angels eke
when Christ in Oxen stall
Was born, forspake for shephierds sake
that he would be a thrall.
And Shephierds being taught
the miracles divine
Of heavenly birth, did first behold
the thundering Impe with eyes.
The mighty Infant gave
the Shephierds liberty
Before the wise and royal Kings
in Cradle him to see.
A Shephierd he him self
disdained not to call,
Those men he termed Sheep that simple
were and meek withal.
And least you think I lie,
from City home again
To Country as I came, In Church
I read them painted plain.
There portrayde are the Beasts
and little Lambs that lie
On soil beside their dames. A hugie
troop from mountains hie
Of Gods on horsseback co^mes,
their Diademes do blaze
With glittring Gold, this sight does make
the passers by to gaze.
No marvel then if Gods
appearde to Pollux sight:
In Villages, in Sheep and home
lie Sheepecots they delight:
GOD is a guest to simple men,
the haughty he does spite.

Alphus. Thou telst the truth, I wish
the fields as hurtlesse be
Unto your Beasts. The Ass, the rack,
and Bullock I did see.
I call to mind the route
that thither f^ockt apace,
Me thinks I see the Kings of Inde
that brought their gifts in place.
One thing I crave, what kind
of shape did Pollux see?
And if thou know it ( Galbula)
do daine to tell it me.

Galbula. I know it well, and will
rehearse the story true,
A worthy fact to tell or hear
for all men to ensue.
The froward Father, and
the Stepdame full of pride,
Had pressed Pollux neck with y^ake
uneasy to abide,
In tender years when youth
swee^e pleasures does persuade:
But when he fealt his force to fail
through such a weary trade,
And saw no Art preuailde
their rigor to relent,
He thought it best to run away:
and thus to flight ybent
His only let was this,
he loved impatiently.
For doting love (a common fault)
does Youth accompany.
Love of it self is strong,
the violence does pass.
He went: At parture (these complaints
to me he wonted was
His dolours to declare)
with mourneful voice he spoke:
Will thou (O Virgin) shead thy tears
for such a traitors sake?
And when thou see thy self
by Lover so betrayde,
Will thou bewail the want of him
that such a pranke has playde?
Will thou thy cruel Friend
remember in distress?
Or shall that loving breast of thine
a chillie cold possess?
That breast that has prouokt^
so many weeping eyes,
Will thou wax wanfor grief? will thou
send sighings to the Skies?
I see the Virgins eyes,
her ears, her painted heart.
Alas may any cunning now
conceal my secret smart?
A double dolor does
distraine my troubled mind,
Her grief and my distress: my woe
to wail is me assignde,
But not to her: my fire
more covertly does burn.
You Gods (I trust) will her preserve
in health till my return.
That after my exile
when I shall back retire,
Our love may have a good success
ere youthful years expire.
Thus talking he did pass,
and would have turnde again:
Such love had bleard the boy, such fr^n-
sie broylde in youthful brain.
But now the Dice were cast,
decreed was the flight,
He underneath a Popple tree
sat down a woeful wight.
Behold a Virgin crowde
with Garlande he did see,
Her face, her eyes, and habit were
Nymphlike in each degree.
She did approach, and thus
the sorry boy bespake.
(Sweet Lad) where will thou wander now?
thy purposde paths forsake.
Alas thou wottst not where
this way would bring thee straight,
Yet dare thou go to places strange:
and thinking no deceit
To lurk in grassie field,
each peril thou neglectst,
All safe thou deemst, and that which likes
thee best, thou most respectst
Like unadvised youth.
The Adder knit in knot,
And lurking in the grass does bite
the man that saw him not.
Th 'vnware is soon begilde.
The Infant dares assay
Withouten dread in burning Coals
with tender hands to play,
And thinks it but a sport
until he feel the fire.
This Country trains the Passengers
at first with sweet desire,
And proffers pleasures rife
with joys exceeding all:
But entered once, foreseeing not
the hurt that may befall,
It setts a thousand snares
and planteth perils more.
This path as soon as you have past,
that hill you see before
Leads to a shadie wood
where cruel beasts do dwell,
To dungeons deep and lothsom va^ts,
as black as any Hell.
And who so is intrapt
shall thence retire no more:
For first he has a fillet swarth
and veil his eyes before.
Then drawn about the wood
through sharp and shrubby thorns,
To Monster he transformed is:
and whilst his tongue he turns
And thinks to speak, he howles,
and coveting upright
To go, he groueling creepes on four,
the heavens are barrd his sight.
Beneath a Valley dark,
a Pit with waters blake
Does stand, and then a mountayn huge
does ouerlooke the Lake.
Thus drawn to stinkyng Styx,
is headlong down yeast
Into the filthy foorde, the Sink
does swallowe him in have:
Thus damnde to Styx in shade
for aye he must abide.
Alas, how many Shephierds through
these dotyng fitts have did?
And perished with their flocks?
but I am busy still
As one vntirde, to show the way
and wrest thee from the ill.
Wherefore do way delays
and fly the flattring door
That trains to death, go seek the coast
that leads to secret shore,
Against the Idalian floods where Carmelus is seen,
To lift his head aloft to Skies
bedeckt with Garlande green.
To ancient fathers first
this Hill gave dwellings good,
As caves and houses made of trees
within a brushy wood.
From thence Religion first
derived his offspring took,
And came amongst your hills, as from
his head, the running brook,
And from one Grandsire as
do many Nephews sproute.
In those same woods, where Beechyboughes
are growing all about,
Where fattie Pix does sweat
and Terebynth does shed
His glewlike gum, and clammie juice.
There after thou have led
A happy hurtlesse life
deuoide of vile offense:
Then into places ever green
and flourishing from thence
I will advance thee straight,
a better lodge to dwell:
Immortal shall thou waxen then,
and (mark what tale I tell)
Thou shall as fellow made
unto the heavenly States,
Get up above the stars, and have
the Nimphs unto thy mates,
Both Hamadriads and
the hilly Orcads hight,
And Napes. Ladies that in sweetes
and Garlands do delight:
With lawful leave to have y^ Skies
both up and down in sight.
Thus having told her tale
to Sky the Virgin flewe.
The^ Pollux swear his mind was turned,
and heart ychangde a new
Forwent his furies fit.
Even as the fiery flash
Is quenched, when Padus with his stream
the frying fields does wash:
So parted cruel Love,
that erst his Arrows shot
At him (good youth) that striving would
those cold hot fitts forgot:
And so good Pollux he
to silent Cloister came.

Alphus. Yea mary, Gods some men inspire,
that look not for the same,
But they with other wroth
and causeless angry be.

Galbula. Such power have Gods on us as on
our sielly sheep have we.
This knowledge will suffice
us simple Country clownes:
Let them contend for greater wit
that wear the Scarlet gowns
And in the City woonne.
Thus person Ianus told
Returnde from town, and said he saw^
it writ in story old.

Alphus. Now goes the Sun to glade
he touches top of hills,
Wherefore that we with him depart
his wented parting wills.
O Galbula get up
those trinkets on thy back
The Scrippe is light, the bottle light,
no pain to bear the pack.
For though the burden way
yet is it good to bear,
Do that, and I will fetch our flocks,
for now the day does wear.

The.viij. Egloge entitled RELIGIO.
The Argument.
TWo Shephierds met yfeare,
one likt the Mountains most,
And the other did commend the Vale
above the Hilly coast.
The praise of Pollux Saint
is intermingled here,
And sacred feasts, with holy days
that happen in the year.
The speakers names.
Candidus. Alphus.
O Alphus, now the scortched groun^
does thirst, because the Sun
Is in the hiest point of Heaven
that he is wont to run.
Wherefore unto the hanging hills
this present time persuades
To drive our flocks where Deaw is rise
and Mountes do cast their shades.
Alphus. Yea, yea, I see the hills afar
and haughty Mountains hie:
But (to be plain) what of the hills
to make I know not I.
For from my Cradle custom was
with me to feed my sheep
In Vale below, by rivers side
to dwell, and flock to keep.
Upon the hilly ground (I pray)
what kind of corn does sproute?

Candidus. O simle siellie witted lobbe,
O plain and pieuish loute,
That aye have dwelt by damping floods
and filthy Fennes below,
Much like the Gnats that haunt y^ lakes
where brushe and rubbish grow,
And where the sluttish vermin cause
a savor like to hell,
And stifling stink in durtie dikes,
and Marrish deapth to dwell.
Where is of frogs, gnats, flies and worms
and other like good store,
Among the Willowes, Alderboughes
and rotten Reeds, with more
Than I can name: and yet do thou
thus dare to mock the Hills
And make so small account of them?
From whence (I pray thee) trills good friend
The spouting Spring? and where
is marble quarre yfounde
That builds y^ Church? where grows y^
in vale or hilly ground.
What soil brings forth the lofty mast?
where grows the Physic grass?
And herbs to cure diseases fell,
if not in hilly place?
I sundry tunes on Baldus mount
the Bearefoote gathred have,
Which Goats diseasde from force of death
is ready way to save:
As Aegon erst to me declarde
when he did geld at Spring
His sowes and lambe^, he taught me that
as sure and sovereign thing.
Take here (quod he) the pass^^gst heart*
that ever grew on ground.
And further tell me (pray thee) where
are Chestnuts to be found
More plentuous than on Hills aloft?
where greater store of Mast?
There are both groves and pasture grounds:
there I have broke my fast
With Pie full many a time and often,
and fattie gruell eat,
There are the sturdie Children borne
bold youths in my conceate,
Broad footed Lads with shoulders square,
well brawned arms and strong,
All hairy, handed hard, whose backs
no weight can lightly wrong.
From thence come lusty Mariners,
that sail the marble Seas,
Are none more fit for Town affairs
or City than are these.
Where thou will have thy Cattle cut,
or seeling timber fellde,
Or Stables varmde, the Privy cleansd
or staying stop that held
The filth, remou^d from where it lay
and bred a loathsome smell,
Or men by Ladders to descend
to Vaultes as dark as Hell:
These, these, are they that do the feate,
their wits are passing good,
And they are of exceeding force
and lusty strength by th Roode.
But what shall need so many words?
all toil they take in hand:
Wait in the Kitchen, make the Fire,
cast on the Chimney brande,
Turn broch ^n cunning wise, make clean
and purge the loouer hole,
For smoke to pass, bear gutts and tripes
to river in a Bole,
Swepe filthy floor with Birche^ broom,
but most I marvel how
They run with burden on their backs
and never seem to bow.
They are bred up among the Rocks
and mid the Mountains woonne*
Like Goats into the crooked Caves
of savage Beasts they roonne.
Beside this, eake the way is short
from top of Hills to Sky,
Up to the azure clouds they reach:
and some do stand so hie
As verily I deem they touch
the golden stars welnie
They say there is a place where as
the Sun from Sea does rise,
Which (if I well remember) seems
unto our mortal eyes
Even with his head to touch y^ Moon,
and that there liu^d a man:
But afterward when greedy Lust
and licorous lips began
To taste the fruit that was forbid,
and that he eat up all
The Apples, keeping none for God
when he for fruit did ^all,
This Glutton was expelde the place
not suffered there to dwell.
This makes that holy fathers like
the lofty Hills so well,
And there do choose them quiet stays
to lead their lives in rest:
As Carthuse witness can full well,
Carmelus, Gargans crest,
Laureta, Athos, Lauern, Syne,
Soractis picked pate,
And Nursis thou that famous art
for aged Fathers fate.
And good Gamalula, whose head
so turretlike does stand,
Beset with Beeche and other trees
that grow about the land.
As for the rest I ouerpasse,
for why I do not mind
In this my tale to compass all.
The Gods of stately kind
Do often frequent the hilly holtes,
when down in vale below
Dwell Ducks, Didopper, Bitour, Goose
Kite, Shag, and other more.

Alphus. Among the Pleasures of the hills
whereof you speak so much,
How chauncde that you do nothing here
the Vine and Harvest touch?
And yet those two are chiefest stays
and aids in life of Man.

Candidus. Those Mountain lads from rocky hills
come hither now and than
To buy our Corn in market place,
Grym wights all grymde with dust,
As rough as hogs, as lean as rakes
raggd, leaping at a crust.
The dwellers show the places kind
and what his nature is.
But that you spoke of Sacred use
and Mountain holynis
Has brought unto my mind again of Pollux what is said.

Alphus. O Candid, if thou can declare
What Goddess it is, what Maid,
Say on, for that whereof we began
to chatte, is all in vain:
More better were of holy trade
to talk, and greater gain.

Candidus. That Galbula that erst was wont
with thee his flock to feed,
Could fully have instructed thee
in thy demand with speed.

Alphus. Of Pollux much was said before,
but yet no word was spoke
There of the Nymph, nor did I then
him thereunto provoke.
But now this talk of Church affairs
and holy sacred things
(For sure they best deserve the praise)
to my remembrance brings.

Candidus. She was no Driad Nymph perdie
that in the woods does woonne:
She was no Muse of those that boute Lybethris Mount does roonne.
Nor any of those Orcades
that haunt the hills on hie:
But Mother she to Mighty GOD
pescended from the Sky.
To bring a peace to such as in
distress and trouble lie.
Dame Tethys is her waiting maid, and lady Ceres eke
Attendes her train, and Aeole he
that by his force does break
And bridles wrath of waiward winds
that in his prison are.
Her God has plast above the Sun
and golden glistring star
Above Cassiope the fair,
and has adornde her head
And sacred front with twice six Signs
that her enuiron spread:
And more than that, the watrie Moon
that shows her face by night
Full underneath her godly foot
his providence has pight.

Alphas. O Candid, wonders thou declarste
which Shephierds never knew,
What is that Tethys tell me, and Cassiops glittring hew?
What is that Aeole that in den
does bridle blustering wind?
What be those fiery Stoads? thou tellst
great meruai^es, rare to find.

Candidus. Some part of them be stars in deed,
some part names found of old.
All which when Pollux had to me
in largest manner told,
Into the Temple led me forth
and fayde: This Sacred Wall
That here thou viewst, is able well
to make thee show of all.
The wall was painted full of Signs
and Figures all about,
All I remember not, my brain
is weak, it is quickly out:
Scarce this I bore away, for all
I often reuolud the same,
And did recompt within my hea^
each thing, and ery name.
For sundry times for to recompt
a thing in covert breast
All Physic far excells, I deem
that feate to be the best.
That Virgin can from darkened Skies,
the duskie clouds remove,
She can to partched corn give drink
to make the Harvest prove.
And when her pleasure is, she can
cause springs in fields to rise,
And when her list repress the same
again in wondrous wise.
She can (if be her pleasure) make
the baraine soil and ground
As fat as any pasture, and
make it with grain abound.
When Scorpius in his darksome lodge
and hellish house receives
The old Saturnus frosty stars,
that worldly things bereaues
Of blissful state, this Virgin can
enforce to keep no coil:
The rattlyng hayle shall nothing noye
the Corn upon the soil.
The house shall never fall by fire
or wasted be with flame:
For now they say, the Skies procure
and angry stars the same.
Oh, if this Virgin be disposde,
she can make all things sure,
If she be friendly, corn shall fill
the barnes, she can procure
Each beast to bring a twinne to light
to glad the masters mind,
Yea and she list, although the sheep
be dry and notte by kind,
She can enforce with twink of eye
and beck of friendly browe
The dugge to strout with milk, y^ back
with wool, and Lambs ynowe.
She can remove all vile disease
that noyes the hurtlesse Beast,
She can tell how to cure the flock
with any grief oppressed.
Now needless is to follow Pan
or any rusticke Saint:
Which ancient folks did honor so,
with follies mist attaint.
I saw about the Altar of
this Virgin, sucking Kid,
Ploughs, Oxen, Sheep, and Ianus Goat,
and written there I spid
In table that at Altar hoong this Verse: Here Ianus he
That lost his Goat, for Goat yfou^d
does offer this to thee.
And whilste I red this writ on wall
with knee on marble stone
Ga^ Pollux pray before the Are
and Virgin call upon.
He said: O Goddess that preserust
both Town and Country well
I pray that Padus boue his banks
and limits may not swell.
And that no Fayrie suck by night
our babes in our arms,
Nor that such Heggs about our coast
may rangle with their charms.
O Goddess favor husbandmen,
the wastfull Want destroy
That is our daily foe, and does
our pasture grounds anoye.
O Goddess, when the Winter coms
and we have sown our seed,
Send down some pleasant showers of rain
to moist the soil at need
Lest creping worms, and vermin vile
in year that is to come
Do gnaw y^ corn with marring mouth
and loathsome little gum.
From Borias blast defend the Fig,
from cruel Crane the Beans,
The Harvest corn from greedy Geese
ybred in Marrish Fennes.
The Ox from spitting Adders jaws,
from Fore and Thief the Sheep,
From Locust Coals and Leltis leaves,
the Vine in Winter keep.
The flock and fold from Woulfes deceit,
the corn from burning blast,
The dogs from madness, towns from fire
and thundering bolts yeast.
The leg of Bacon from the Mouse,
the Ga^mon from the wight
That kepes the Camp, and in the field
does daily use to fight.
From Palmer, and the slothful: Oh,
I have welnie forgot
The rest, perhaps recital of
the former Verse will not
Be hurtful, but reduce to mind
what I had thought to say:
Wherefore I will begin again,
where I right now did stay.
The leg of Bacon from the Mouse
the Ga^mon from the wight
That keeps the Camp, and in the field
does daily use to fight.
From Palmer and the slouthful Snaile
the Gardens green as Grass.
See ( Alphus) what a Verse can do?
now is it come to pass
As erst I thought it would in deed,
remembrance is renewde.
O Virgin save from thunders rore A silly shep hierdes simple requ^st.

the Drink we lately brewde.
Keep well the blossomd Ewes from cold,
the Calves from stinging Fly.
The Hogs from squince and swelling throat
so that they may not die.
That Ploughmens labor be not lost
O Goddess do thy best,
Let not the Hyues of Honey Bees
by Hornets be oppressed.
Ne let the Lynet spill the Hirce
or Myllet seeds destroy,
Nor briers, by renting of the wool
ere sheare time, sheep anoy.
Let not the hangyng burre stick fast
upon the hairie fleese
That makes the flock pildnecked, and
his covering coat to leese.
O Goddess that do govern men
and have of children care,
O Goddess ease to laboryng wights
and such as bide the care.
The salve to such as are diseasde,
of flocks the chiefest stay.
I thee beseech to yield a beck
to this that I do say.
This prayer devoutly Pollux made
the whilst I leande my back
Unto a poast, and stayde my foot
against a staff, it stacks
Within my brain that he had said,
his words I noted well,
I plaste the process in my breast
that he before did tell.

Alphus. How think thou Candid is it not right
and reason that we should
To Pollux yield some gift for prayers
and Sacred tale he told?
For sure by such devotion
our richesse are preserved.

Candidus. What else? somewhat we must bestow,
for somewhat he deserved.

Alphus. What shall we give? by the Roode a Calf
is costly to ^orgoe,
We either will a Lamb, or Hare,
or Goose on him bestow.

Candidus. The time instructs what to give.
at Winter serves the Hare,
When ^or the Snow he can no^*
the Goofe we best may spare
At latter end of Harvest time
when Summer wears away
The Filberd, Appels, clustred Grapes
about Midsommer day.
The sucking Kids, and bleating Lambs
at entering of the Spring.
For then if rotten hay by chance
avoid them any thing,
Or any thou so weak epsy,
as nether well can live,
Nor butcher in the market place
for him will money give,
(The gift will be accepted well)
that Lamb of all the rest
Bestow (I say) to make a friend
with him I count it best.
Let Pollux have it for his pains
and solemn tale ytolde.
He after dinner when that I
from him departed would,
Gave me such Verses as he found
writ in some ancient book
Of holy Virgins solemn feasts:
and said, I pray thee look
Upon this gear when so by hap
thou art with care oppressed,
Recount this medcine of the mind
and fix it fast in breast.
What time the Sun the Lion leaue^ and Virgo entres in,
Then in remembrance of this Virgin
let the youth begin
And aged eke with silver hairs,
to triumph and be glad,
For then she left the earth and to
the Skies her journey had.
The four and twenteth after that
is holy day anewe,
This Virgins birth day makes y^ church
and altars (this is true)
With taper light to shine like fire
and glister all with flame:
Then does y^ Priest new offerings make,
the time requires the same.
Then Libra makes return in have
to cause the Summer night
To be full equal with the day
and so appear in sight.
The men of Pycen waxen glad on Adrianus flood
Then come Illyrians, Chaons eke and Thuscans with their good
And ware to sell for greedy gain, from Vmbria other some,
Venetians, men of Sicill to Lauretum temple come
By troops to offer up their gifts:
and having prayde a time,
Up to the stately mountain they
in flocks together clime.
And when the Sun does enter in
his house that bends the Bow
By shorter course, and bitter frosts
anoy the soil below,
Shut up in Cloister close she did
the mighty God conceive,
Which contemplation from her head
did worldly thoughts bereave.
Her proper parents she forgot,
so much on God she thought.
And when that Phoe^us flees the Bow^
whose string is bent so tought,
And gins unto the lodging cold
of horned Goat to go:
Then let both man and woman on
with garments best to show,
And let them keep that sacred day
high holy feast, wherein
With sacred seed that aged Sire
did fill his wife within.
For in that day above the rest
she did conceive the child
That washed away the sin that would
all mortal men defilde.
When Sol the moistie harbor of Aquarius vnderglides,
At point to bring the Spring about:
then go you gallant brides
And Matrons, set the Altars full
of torch and taper light,
Cast cense in flame to make a fume
bring candles blasing bright,
Make pomp as great as ere you can.
This Lady brought a bed
Her little Babe has borne to church
and has full happly sped.
When he the Captain of the hierd
with glittring fleece of gold
(I mean the Ram) begins to quite
the earth from Winter cold,
And brings the gentle fitts of heat
and pleasant puffes of wind
Allowing day more hours than night,
as is the Summers kind,
Let Gabriell then the Angel come
and do his message right,
Declaring tidings to the Nymph that made the Nymph afright.
That Holy day the Thuscans all
from Mountains makes descend^
And Arnycols procures to the Florence Church to wend.
And then (for why the Virgin was
not long before they say,
Espousde) becomes unwedded maide^
to celebrate the day.
When Phoebus under farthest point
of crawling Crabbe does go,
And Dog approaching brings disease,
and makes the fevers grow:
^epe holy eke that sacred tide,
with incense cast in fire,
for Mary then from mother of John
did home again retire.
About the stony Altars hang
to either damme a share
(In token of your joyful hearts) of Lady Ceres ware.
The Corn that first was ripe in fields,
and began to change his hew,
Do offer that (I say) to them
that Mothers are to view.
This Pollux taught: for walking he
amid the Mountains hie
A field to fold, did chance to cast
his raunging eyes to Sky
In clear and quiet starrie night:
and saw by fortune there
The order of the Heavens, and how
the stars disposed were.
And more than these bisides ywis:
but fast declining Sun
Will not permit as now we should
prolong our talk begun.

The.ix. Egloge entitled FALCO.
The Argument.
HERE Faustul having thoroughly tryde
the nature of the Roman ground:
The vileness of the soil, and Shephierds
filthy manners does expound.
The speakers names.
Faustulus. Candidus.
Faustulus. O Candid how befalls
that thou from native home
A wight exilde in foreign land
and strangie Realm do rome?
For here no Pastures are
nor Fountains to be found,
No safe Sheepecoates, no shrouding shades,
to keep the cattle sound.

Candidus. Thus ( Faustul) stands the case, one Coridon that in
These quarters kept his flock, and by
that mean great wealth did win,
Drove me to deem that here
amyd these Mountains was
Most pleasant Pasture for my Sheep,
and wholesome vain of grass.
But since now I see
and plainly view with eye,
The barren ground and Pastures pielde,
soil rockie, Fountains dry,
It yrks me that I came
so rashly out of door,
The iourneys long, and leaving of
my Country grieves me sore.

Faustulus. Well since it was thy hap
in safety to attain
The Latin Pastures, I would crave
(if thou will take the pain)
To my poor house to come,
of fellowship do so,
I have ^ewe akers here of land
to live upon, no mo
Than poorly will maintain
my low and needy state:
But such as it is, take part I pray
let run in common rate.
Perhaps some better hap
and fortune will befall.
For Chance resembles much a blast
of wind, to wavering thrall.
Come to my sedgie Coat
till raging heat be past,
And whilst the flock laid down on soil
do chewe the Cud full fast.
Do way the Sheepecrooke, sit
thee down and tipple square:
We need to drink, by drink we shall
avoid this scorching care.
Take thou the Cruse in hand,
for after drink (they say)
The tale with better grace is told
it better goes away.

Candidus. What mad man would in such
a heat refuse the Cup?

Faustulus. Yea, Wine does quel the cruel thirst
if it be tippled up.
Wine does diminish care
and dolours of the mind:
As wine breeds friendships, so it does
augment the strength by kind.

Candidus. This Country has good Grapes,
if so they here do grow.
Fill out again, the former draught
is but a taste you know.
The second weates the jaws,
the third does cool the rage
Of burning mouth, the fourth with thirst
a cruel war does wage.
The fifth full fiercely fights,
the sixth does conquer aye,
The seventh triumphs, Oenophilus
erst so was wont to say.

Candidus. It Is wisdom to incline
and follow sound advise,
It Is for the profit to give ear
to aged Fathers wise.
Now thirst is conquered well,
yet naythelesse my heart
Is pensive aye, and thoughtful care
augments my wonted smart.

Faustulus. As thirst is banished, so
the mind shall purchase ease:
Fill out the licour of the Grape,
drink freely if you please.
This Physic is to drive
the heart pangs out of place.
Rome to abandon cruel cares
this Medcine used like ease.

Candidus. All toil and travail craves
a time of rest and stay,
Let bottle stand, and stop him close
to keep the Flies away.
The day is nothing wette,
not deawie is the night,
Which makes that forage ca^ not grow
but is consumed quight.
Fell famine, crueil toil,
with heat of scortching air
Have made the Cattle passing lean,
and brought them in despair
Of ever being fat:
scarce can they draw their wind,
Their guts are clung to empty skin,
the bones stick out behind.
This Ram that beat the Woulfe
with horn and bounsing brow,
Is weaker than a Sheep, a Lamb
does pass his courage now.
Thus much the Crow declarde
with holy sacred bill:
But I was ouerhastly bent
to follow raging will.
Scarce was I ^ut of door
but he was straight at hand,
And bringing ill abodement, began
on houses top to stand
Upon the lefter side,
and with an angry beak
With open sign of fell myss^hap
aloude began to squeake
O most unhappy beast,
that wonted were of yore
When on our soil thou feddst, to bring
of Milk and Cattle store,
Now seeking Pastures new,
more kindly strength do miss
By weary travail, than by food
thou gained have ywisse.
Here both we faint yfeare,
thou with thy slender fare,
And I poor wight in sunder crushed
with cruel girding care.
Now is our country stuffed
with wealth: what Meadow grounds
Have we? What pastures green as leeke
within our Country bounds?
O merry joyful soil,
and fertile fields to see,
Where aye is Corn upon the ground
and where fresh rivers be
Aye passing through the Towns
and Buroughs where we woonne,
And where through erie Village and
each Garden floods do roonne.
This makes the goodly flocks
and Pasture fields so fat.
When crabbed Cancer rules, and men
do plie the threshing batte,
And scortching Iulie scaldes:
the fields do flourish green,
The Apples grow in every hedge.
amid the brakes are seen
Sweet smelling flowers every where
and pleasant to the nose,
In every bush there stands on stalk
of every hue a Rose.
O pleasant shade of Groves
and sound of trembling leaves,
Which erst (I mind) with thee I had
among the shadie greaues.
Where we the Turtles plaint
and Swallows songs did hear
And Philome^as sundry tunes,
when Locusts first appear,
That make the Groves to ring
with shrill and shrieking cries,
The air that shook the leauie boughs from Eurus did arise.
Aloft our heads the tree that Cornus hight there hangde,
Whose boistrous arms were all about
with Berries bravely spangde.
I sitting on the ground
saw how the beasts did sport,
And tender Lambs with hurtlesse horns
did fight in friendly sort.
And when that sleep was past,
or staring to the Skies.
I blewe my Pipe, or else did sing
what best I might devise.
Another while I would
laid gruffe upon the g^^sse,
Pluck Strawberies from slender stalke^
the time away to pass.

Faustulus. Then happy was thy life,
thou were a blessed wight,
But of that friendly Fortune thou
did take no great delight.
Thou scorndst that present state,
a worsse not having tried,
And that procurde that Fortune so
away from thee did glide.
When so it coms again,
(if ever thou have the hap)
Even as the branches of the Vine
the propping poastes do lap,
And them enuiron grow
fasc clasping them about:
So catch her with thy hands, and caught
let her no way get out.
She goes and makes return,
and often changes hue:
Much like the Heggs that by report
about the Mountains flue,
And rangled in ^he dark
and shadie Mist of night.
And as this Fortune shifts her looks,
and chops and changes sight,
So wandering is her mind,
mere iestings are her joys:
Look what she gave she takes again,
no reason, all in toys.
The man that fears the worst,
or warely looks about,
She scorns and as an abject hates,
she shuts the Dastard out.

Candidus. As often as we to mind
do call our Country soil
We can not patiently endure
this woeful weary toil^.
But whether run my wits
that am tormented thus?
To double present woe do I
now think on former bliss?
Now merry May is come,
the Vine is green to view,
Now Corn has taken eire, Pomegranats
are of golden hiewe.
Each where the bushes smell,
the Elder trees are white
Within our Country, al about both Pade and Mince in sight.
But here yet scarcely do
the Groves begin to bood,
And if so be that in the spring
the ground be dead, by th'Roo^
What will it do when force
of Winter coms in place,
And soil is clad with frostie clothes
or scalding Summers blase?
Yet here are hierds of beasts
with flick and finest skin,
upon whose boistrous brauned necks
the yoke has never bin:
Whose sorheads hardened are
with double horn to see,
No doubt, unless they fed agood,
they could not lightly be
Deawlapped so before
with dangles hanging down.

Fausculus. These beasts whose lostis heads and lokes
are lifted hie from groune,
And have such spindle shankes
and go with lostie gates:
Devour up all, first grass, and then
they make the boughs their cates.
With upward reaching jaws
and greedy gaping chappe,
They chew the chiefest pasture grounds
and trees in sunder snappe.
This weak and siellie beast
that only feeds on grass
That grows on ground, does fast full often
in Pastures bare as glass.

Candidus. What needs such lavish talk?
all living things of kind
Have this condition, aye the small
the great his foe does find.
The Lamb is pray to Woulfe,
to Eagle gentle Doves,
The Delphin hunts the hurttesse fish
that in the wallowe moves.
How coms this gear about?
a monstrous thing it is.
This place, if from aloft thou look
will seem to be ywis
Good pasture ground and fine,
as full of grass as needs:
But how much nearer that you come,
the more appear the weeds,
Then shows the filth his kind,
then plainly it is discride.

Faustulus. Rome is to men as to the birds
the Owl with visage wide,
She sits upon a stock,
and like a stately Queen
With lofty berks she calls a far
the Birds that nie her been.
The route suspecting naught
together come apace,
They marvel at her picked ears
and ghastly glewing face,
And at her Monstrous head
and crooked bending byll:
Whilst thus (I say) they hoppe about
not minding any ill,
From spring to sprig, from bough
to bough, from tree to tree,
Some thread^^ are with limed lace,
with twigs some other be
Ycaught: thus all as pray
unto the Broach do go.

Candidus. O this is passing, nothing can
he better said I trow.
But see how yonder Snake
with crooked crawling pace
Glides on the gravel ground, and a^
he comes to thy place
With shirstie gaping jaws
and tongue infectes the air.

Faustulus. O Candid mind well what I say,
let to thy breast repair,
What time thou wandrest in the wood
thine eyes defend
And guard with hat, for bushie thorns
their poinant pricks pretend
To noy thy face, and if
thou take not great good heed
The crooked hanging brimbles will
rent off thy crooked weed.
Do not away thy Crook,
have bosom full of stones,
Least some new unexpected foe
oppress thee for the nones.
Put on thy Cokers eke
and stirteps to beware,
The bushie Groves are full of Snakes,
with bite they breed our care,
In daily hazard of our lives,
and now the Summer makes
Their poisoned Venom ranckle sore
where so by chance it takes.
A thousand Wolves there be,
as many Foxes here
Below in bottom of the Vale,
that do not yet appear.
And (monstrous thing to speak)
my self have seen with eye
Men Woulflie shape and manners put
in proof and practice I,
That with their flocks have dealt
too cruelly in deed,
And all imbrude with slaughter of
their beasts they forced to bleed.
The neighbor places laugh,
nor fear the cruel spoil,
Nor once will go about to stop
this greedy bloody broile.
And oftentimes appear
fell ugly shapes to sight,
Which earth by influence vile brings forth,
sometime the Dogs do fight
And use such cruel rage,
as far they do surpass
The tyranny of bloody Wolves:
that route that rampire was
And guard to flocks of yore,
put on a wrathful mind,
And slay the siellie Cattle that
their fortune is to find.
In Egypt men report
they honored certain beasts
And sundry coumpted Gods to be
with pomp and solemn feasts.
That superstition was
deserving lesser blame
Than ours, for we to every beast
a several Altar frame:
A thing contrary quite
to God, and laws of kind.
For he ordainde a man as head
and chief of brutish kind.
And sundry times the hot
and scalding Summers rays
And plagie year approaches fast,
that every beast decays
About the open fields:
the sucking Lamb that cries
At dead Dams teate himself with vile
disease on sudden dies.
Even underneath the yoke
the Oxen leese their breath,
And as they travail in the way
yield life to cruel death.
No reason in the plague,
no Phys^cke to aslake
This venom vile, and poysonde filth:
but house from house does take
Infection of the same,
and drinks up deadly sore,
And daily so contagion of
this poison grows to more.
This plague kills lightly no
fell savage bluddie beast,
The young ones prosper too too well,
the Wolves make gladsome feast
And rend with ruthlesse chaps
our siellie cattle that
But lately did, and by our loss
thus Wolves do waxen fat.

Candidus. Alas unhappy I,
what rash and foolish mood
Drew me? who so does credit fame,
I think him mad and wood.
Of Roman hills I heard, of stately Tyber eake,
And men of goodly Roman roofes
and buildings erst did speak.
I out of hand had great
desire to see the same,
And lead my life within a soil
that was of such a name.
With half my hierd I came
(a mad man in my thought)
For why with me both Tent and all
my Shephierds trinckets brought
Throughout the Mountains hie,
Pailes, Pans ymade of brass,
With Caldrons, Cheesefat eke, and all
the rest that fittest was
For making of the Cheese*
and so it was my hap
To lose my troublous travail and
my charges at a clap.
Alas what shall I do?
which way my self conuart?
The hoped pleasures are denied,
there are in erie part
So many dangerous haps,
so sundry perils pressed,
As I am driven unto my Coat
again to take my rest:
Constrainde of force to say
and grant it ill begun,
The toil I took in hand of late
by heat of scalding sun,
By weary travail home to slocks
I am enforst to run.
Alas unhappy hierd,
O Shephierd ill accursed,
More better had it been for thee
if thou had staide at furst
At home in native soil,
and there have waxen old
(Than thither to have rashly come)
where thou moughtst have be^ bold
In country well beknowne of thee,
and coast exceeding cold:
And Padus banckes about, and Athesis too strayde,
Or there where Myncius twhart y^ fields
and Pastures runs vnstaide.
Or else where Abdua with
his silver chanel flows
To have remainde, and fed thy hierde
with sweet and wholesome bows.

Faustulus. This light belief of thine,
both thee and me beguiles,
For I have seen those greedy wights
that longd to climb erewhiles
And sat in pleasures mount,
from praised goods to slip,
Nor could escape: Experience
causes men beware the whip.
The wary children try
and wisely look about,
Nor follow ery liked thing
though braggers boast it out.
Now chiefest things their laud
and earned praise do want,
That were of yore right worthy same,
(all these I needs must grant)
Whose names alone remain: as Lune and Adria eake,
And Saluya with ancient Troie of whom did Vmber speak.
But (as I said) the names
are now alive and left,
The rest ungrateful wasting Time
and fretting Age has re^t.
Though now of lesser laud
and praise our Country be,
Yet better is the thing perhaps.
Each man alive does see
And knows what great renoume Rome ever had ere this:
The fame (good faith) as yet remains,
the ancient gain begis
And profit is suppressed.
Those floods that erst did flow
Atwhart the fields and Pasture grounds,
find lack of licour now.
Dry are the Wellie veins,
the moisture quite is gone,
No cloud does shoure, nor Tyber glides
the gasping fields upon.
Time ancient Conduites has
and leaden Pipes defast,
The Towers are in decay: wherefore
hence hence (my Goats) in have.
Here woons but famine now,
here want of wealth does reign:
Yet here (they say) does dwell, and we
our selves have seen it plain
A Shephierd, one that of the Falcon, Falco hight,
Well storde of ^leezie Sheep, for Pasture
grounds a wealthy wight.
That in his Songs excels
the antique Poets, and
The skillful Orpheus that both woods
and rocks about the land
By sorce of Music drew,
the rest of Roman race
He so ^arre does surpass (a strange
and monstrous vgglie case)
As Padus Tybers stream, and Abdua Macras flood,
The Willow Bulrush, Thistle Rose,
the Seaweedes Popple wood.
We think him not unlike
that noble worthy might
Whose Altars Maro made to shine
twelve days with sacred light.
This Shephrerd kepes his fluck^,
with far more watchful care
Than Argus did that in his head
a hundredth watchmen bare.
And Daphnis not alone, but that Apollo take
That fed Admetus hierd in Thessale
soil as Poets speak.
Well worthy to succeed
and take the charge in hand
Of Fisher that forewent his nets,
and kept his Sheep at land.
He knows the way to guard
his cattle, how to drive
Diseases from infected flock,
and save his Lambs alive:
Moist eke the Pasture grounds,
give grass, let riu^rs go,
And reconcile the mighty Jove,
abandon theeuish foe.
Beat off the barking Woulfe,
that seeks the beasts to kill.
O Candid here make thy abode if so be Falcos will:
But if he once restrain
his favor and his grace,
Drive thou away the hierde, and haste
to seek a better place.

FINIS.
