The sermon of doctor Colete / made to the Conuocacion at Paulis.



YE are come to gether to day / fathers and right wise men / to enter
council: in the which / what ye will do / and what matters ye will handell /
yet we understand not. But we wysshe / that ones reme^brynge your name and
profession / ye would mind the reformation of the churches matter. For hit was
never more need. And ye state of the church did never desire more your
endeavors. For ye spouse of Christ / ye church / whom ye would should be
without spotte or wryncle / is made foul and evil fauord / as says Esaias:
The faithful cite is made an harlotte: And as says Hieremias: She has done
lechery with many lovers: whereby she has conceived many seeds of wyckednes:
and daily brings forth very foul fruit. wherefore I came hither to day
fathers / to warn you / that in this your council / with all your mind / ye
think upon the reformation of the church. But for sothe I came not wyllyngly:
For I knew mine unworthiness. I saw beside / how hard it was to please the
precise judgment of so many men. For I iuged it utterly unworthy and unmeet /
ye and almost to malapert / that I a servant / should counsel my lords: That
I a son / should teach you my fathers. Truly it had been meter for some one
of the fathers / yt is to say / you prelates might have done it with more grave
auctorite / and greatter wisdom. But the commandment was to be obeyed of
the most reverent father and lord / the archebysshoppe / presydent of this
council / which laid upon me this bourden / truly to heavy for me. we read /
that the prophette Samuel said: Obedience is better than sacrifice? wherefore
fathers and right worthy men / I pray you / and beseech you / that this day
ye would sustain my weakness with your goodness and patience. Farthermore to
help me at the beginning with your good prayers. And before all thing let us
pray unto god the father all mighty. First remembrynge our most holy father
the pope / and all spiritual pastors / with all christen people / farthermore
the most reverent father and lord / the archebishoppe president of this
counsel / and al bishops / and all the Clergy / and all the people of
England: Remembrynge finally this your congregation / desirynge god to inspire
your minds so accordyngly to agree / to such profit and fruit of the church
/ that ye seem not after the council fynysshed / to have been gethered to
gether in vain and without cause. Let us all say Pater noster.

To exhort you reverent fathers to the endeavor of reformation of ye churches
estate: because that nothing has so disfigured the face of the church / as
has the facion of seculer and worldly living in clerks and prestes: I know
not where more conveniently to take beginning of my tale / than of the apostle
Paul / in whose temple ye are gethered to gether. For he writynge unto the
Romans / and under their name unto you says: Be you not conformed to this
world: but be you reformed in the newnes of your understanding / that ye may
prove what is the good will of god well pleasing and perfect. This did the
apostell write to all christen men / but most chiefly unto prestes and
bishops. Prestes and bishops are the light of ye world. For unto them said
our savior: you are the light of the world. And he said also: If the light
that is in the be darkness / how dark shall the darkness be? That is to say /
if prestes and bishops / that should be as lyghtes / run in the dark way of
the world / how dark than shall the secular people be? wherefore saint Paul
said chiefly unto prestes and bishops: Be you not conformable to this world /
but be ye reformed. In the which words the apostle does two things. First
he does forbid that we be not conformable to the world / and be made carnal.
Farthermore he does command that we be reformed in the spyryte of god /
whereby we are spiritual. I entendynge to follow this order / I will speak
first of confirmation / than after of reformation. Be you not (says he)
conformable to this world. The apostle calls the world / the ways and
manner of secular living: the which chiefly does rest in four euilles of
this world: that is to say / in diuilisshe pride / in carnal concupiscence /
in worldly covetousness / in secular business: These are in the world / as saint
John^ the apostle witnesses in his pistell canonical. For he says: All
thing that is in the world / is either the concupiscence of the flesh / or
the concupiscence of the eyes / or pride of life. The same are now and reygne
in the church / and in me^ of the church / that we may seem truly to say /
all thing that is in the church / is either concupiscence of flesh / or eyes
/ or pride of life. And first for to speak of pride of life / how much
gredynes and appetite of honor and dignity is now a days in men of the
church? How ro^ne they / ye almost out of brethe / from one benefice to an
other: from the less to the more / from the lower to the higher? who sees not
this? who seeing this sorowethe not? More over these yt are in the same
dignities / the most part of them does go with so stately a cou^tena^ce and
with so high lokes / that they seem not to be put in the humble bysshoprike of
Christ / but rather in the high lordship / and power of the world / not
knowing / nor aduertisinge / what Christ / the master of all mekenes / said
unto his disciples / whom he called to be bysshoppes and prestes: The princis
of people (says he) have lordshyp of them: and those that be in auctorite have
power: but do ye not so: but he that is greatter among you / let him be
minister. He that is highest in dignity / be he the servant of all men. The
son of man came not to be minystred unto / but to ministre. By which words
our savior does plainly teach / that the maistry in the church / is none
other thing than a ministration: And the high dignity in a man of the church
/ to be none other thing than a meke service.

The second secular evil is carnal concupiscence. Has not this vice so
grown and waxen in the church as a fludde of their lust? so that there is
nothing looked fore more diligently / in this most besy time / of the most
part of prestes / than that that does delight and please the senses? They give
them self to feasts and bankettynge: They spe^de them self in vain bablyng:
They give them self to sportes and plays: They apply them self to hunting
and haukynge. They drown them self in the delytes of this world. Procurers
and fynders of lusts they set by. Against ye which kind of men / Judas the
apostle cries out in his pistel / saying: woe unto them / which have gone the
way of Cain: They are foul and bestly festing in their meats without fear
fedyng them self: fluddes of the wild see / fomynge fomynge out their
confusions: unto whom the storm of darkness is reserved for everlasting.

Covetousness is the third secular evil: the which saint John^ the apostell
calls concupiscence of the eyes: Saint Paul calls hit idolatry. This
abominable pestilence has so entered in the mind / almost of all pristes / and
so has blinded the eyes of the mind / that we are blind to all things / but
only unto those / which seem to bring unto us some gaynes. For what other
thing seek we now a days in the church / than fat benefices and high
promotions? ye and in the same promotions / of what other thing do we pass
upon / tha^ of our tithes and re^tes? That we care not how many / how
chargeful / how great benefices we take / so that they be of greatte valor. O
covetousness: saint Paul justly called the ye root of all evil. Of yt comech
this heaping of benefices upon benefices: Of the so great pensions assigned of
many benefyces resygned: Of the / all the suynge for tithes / for offrynge /
for mortuaries / for delapidations / by the right and title of the church: For
the which thing we strive no less tha^ for our own life: O covetousness: of
the comes these chargefull visitations of bishops / of the comes the
corruptnes of courts and these daily new inue^tio^s / where with the sely
people are so sore vexed. Of the comes the besyte and wantonness of officials.
O covetousness mother of all iniquity. Of the comes this fervent study of
ordinaries to dilate their jurisdictions: Of the comes this wood and ragenge
contention in ordinaries / of the insinuatio^ of testamentes: of the comes the
vndewe sequestration of fruits: Of the comes the superstitious obseruyng of al
those laws / that sou^de to any lucre / setting a side and dispisynge those
that concern the amendme^t of manners. what should I rehearse the rest? To be
short / and to conclude at one word: All corruptnes / all the decay of the
church / all the offenses of the world / come of the covetousness of prestes.
According to that of Saint Paul / that here I repete again / and beat in to
your ears: Covetousness is the root of all evil.

The fourth secular evil / that spotteth and makes ill favored the face of
the church / is the continual secular occupation: wherein prestes and bishops
now a days does besy the^ self / the servants rather of men than of god:
the warriors rather of this world than of Christ. For the apostle Paul
writes unto Timothe: No man being gods soudiour / turmoyle him self with
seculare busynes. The warrynge of them is not carnal but spiritual. For our
warrynge is to pray / to read and study scriptures / to preach the word of
god / to ministre the sacraments of health / to do sacrifice for the people /
and to offer hostis for their sins. For we are mediators and means unto god
for men: The which saint Paul witnessethe / writynge to the Hebrews: Every
bishop (says he) taken of men / is ordained for men in those things that be
unto god / that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. wherefore those
apostels / that were the first pristes and bishops / did so much abhor
from all manner of medlyng of secular things / that they would not minystre the
meat / that was necessary to poor people / all though that were a great
work of virtue: but they said: it is not mete / that we should leave the word
of god / and serve tables: we will be continually in prayer / and preaching
the word of god. And saint Paul cries unto the Corinthes. If you have any
secular besynes / ordeyne them to be iuges / that be most in contempt in ye
church. without dout / of this secularitie / and that clerks and prestes
(leauyng all spiritualnes) do turmoyle them self with erthly occupations /
many evils do follow. First the dignity of pristhode is dishonored / the
which is greatter than other the kings or emperors: it is egall with the
dignite of angels. But the brightness of this great dignity is sore shadowed /
when prestes are occupied in erthly things: whose conversation ought to be in
heaven.

Secondarily pristhode is despised / when there is no difference betwixt such
pristis and lay people: but according to the prophecy of Ozee. As the people
be / so are the pristes.

Thyrdly the beautiful order / and holy dignite in the church / is confused /
wha^ the highest in the church do meddle with vile and erthly things: and in
their stead / vile and abiecte persons do exercise high and heavenly things.

Fourthly the lay people have great occasion of evils and cause to fall / when
those men whose duty is to draw men from the affection of this world / by
their continual conversation in this world / teache men to love this world:
and of the love of the world cast them down heedlyng in to hell.

More over in such pristes / that are so besyed / there must needs follow
hypocrisy. For when they be so mixte and confused with the lay people / under
the garment and habit of a priste / they live plainly after the lay facion.
Also by spiritual wekenes and bondage fear / when they are made weak with the
waters of this world: they dare neither do nor say / but such things as they
know to be pleasant and tha^kefull to their princis. At last ignorancy and
blyndnes / when they are blinded with the darkness of this world / they se
nothing but erthly things. wherefore our savior Christ / not with out cause
/ did warn the prelates of his church: Take heed (said he) lest your hearts
be grieved with glotony and dronke^nes / and with the cares of this world. with
the cares (says he) of this world / wherewith the hearts of pristes being
sore charged / they can not hold and lift up their minds to high and
heavenly things.

Many other evils there be / beside those that follow of the secularitie of
pristis / which were long here to reherce / but I make an end.

These be the four euyls that I have spoken of / O fathers / O pristes / by
the which we are conformable to this world / by the which the face of the
church is made evil favored / by the which the state of it is distroyed /
truly much more tha^ it was in the beginning by the persecution of tyrants:
or afterward by the invasion that followed of heretics. For in the persecution
of tyrants / the church being vexed was made stronger and bryghter: In the
invasion of heretykes / the church being shaken / was made wyser and more
cunnyng in holy writ. But sens this secularitie was brought in / after that
the secular manner of living crepte in / in the men of the church: the root
of all spiritual life / that is to say / charity was extincte: The which
taken away / there can another wise nor strong church be in god.

In this time also we perceive contradiction of the lay people. But they are
not so much contrary unto us / as we are our self. Nor their contrarines
hurts not us so much as the contrarines of our evil life / the which is
contrary both to god and Christ. For he said: who that is not with me / is
against me.

we are also now a days grieved of heretykes / men mad with marvelous
folysshenes: but the heresies of them are not so pestilent and pernicious unto
us and the people / as the evil and wicked life of pristes: the which (if we
believe saint Barnard) is a certain kind of heresye / and chief of all / and
most perilous. For that same holy father / in a certain convocation /
preaching unto the pristes of his time / in a certain sermon / so he said by
these words. There be many catholyke and faithful men in speaking and
preaching / the which same men are heretykes in workyng: For that that
heretics do by evil teaching: that same do they through evil exaumple /
they lead the people out of the right way / and bring them in to error of
life. And so much they are worse than heretyckes / how much their works
prevail their words. This that holy father saint Barnarde / with a great and
a fervent spirit / said against the sect of evil pristes in his time: By
which words he shewethe plainly / to be two manner of heresies / the one to be
of perverse teaching / and the the other of naughty life: Of which this later is
worse and more peryllous: the which raygneth now in the church in pristes /
not living pristly but secularly / to the utter and miserable destruction of
the church. wherefore you fathers / you prestes / and all you of the clergy /
at the last look up and awake / from this your sleep in this forgetful world:
And at the last / being well awaked / here Paul crienge unto you: Be you not
conformable unto this world. And this for the first part. Now let us come to
the second.

The second part of reformation.
BUt be you reformed in the newnes of your understanding. The second thing
that saint Paul commands / is that we be reformed in to a new
understanding / that we smelle those things that be of god. Be we reformed
unto those things / that are contrary to those I spoke of even now: that is
to say / to mekenes / to sobernes / to charity / to spiritual occupation:
That as ye said Paul writes unto Titus / Renyenge al wickedness and worldly
desires / we live in this world soberly / truly / and virtuously.

This reformation and restoring of the churches estate must needs begin of
you our fathers / and so follow in us your pristes / and in all the clergy.
you are our heedes: you are an example of living unto us. Unto you we look as
unto marks of our direction. In you and in your life we desire to read as in
lively books / how and after what facion we may live. wherefore if you will
ponder and look upon our mottis / first take away the blocks out of your
eyes. Hit is an old proverb: Physician heal thy self. you spiritual
physicians / first taste you this medicine of purgation of manners: and tha^
after offer us the same to taste.

The way / where by the church may be reformed in to better facio^ / is not
for to make new lawis. For there be laws many / inowe / and out of nombre /
as Solomon says: Nothing is new under the son. For the evils that are now
in the church / were before in time paste: and there is no fault / but that
fathers have provided very good remedies for hit. There are no trespaces / but
that there be laws against them in ye body of the Canon law. Therefore hit is
no need / that new laws and constitutions be made: But that those / that are
made all redye / be kept. wherefore in this your assemble / let those laws /
that are made / be called before you and rehearsed. Those laws (I say) that
restrain vice / and those that further virtue.

First let those laws be rehearsed / that do warn you fathers / that ye put
not over soon your hands on every man / or admit unto holy orders. For there
is ye well of evils / that the broad gate of holy orders opened / every man
that offers him self / is all where admytted without pulling back. Thereof
spryngeth and comes out the people / that are in the church both of unlearned
and evil pristes. Hit is not enough for a priste (after my judgment) to
construe a collette / to put forth a question / or to answer to a sopheme: but
much more a good / a pure / and a holy life / approved manners / metely
learning of holy scripture / some knowledge of the sacraments. Chiefly and
above all thing / the fear of god / and love of the heavenly life.

Let the laws be rehearsed / that command that benefices of the church be
given to those that are worthy: And that promotions be made in the church by
the right balance of virtue / not by carnal affection: not by the acception
of persons: whereby hit happens now adays / that boys for old men /
fools for wise men / evil for good / do reign and rule.

Let the laws be rehearsed / that warreth against the spotte of Symonie. The
which coruption / the which infection / the which cruel and odible
pestilence so crepteth now abroad / as the canker evil / in the minds of
prestes: that many of them are not aferde now a days / both by prayer and
service / rewards and promesses / to get them great dignities.

Let the laws be rehearsed / that command personal residence of curates in
their churches. For of this many evils grow: by cause all things now a days
are done by vicaries and parysshe prestes: ye and those foolysshe also / and
unmeet: and often times wicked: that seek none other thing in the people than
foul lucre / whereof comes occasion of evil heresies / and ill christendom in
the people.

Let be rehearsed the laws and holy rules given of fathers / of the life and
honesty of clerks: that forbydde that a clerk be no merchant / that he be no
usurer / that he be no hunter / that he be no common player / that he bear no
weapon.

The laws that forbid clerks to haunte tauernes: that forbydde them to have
suspecte familiarity with women. The laws that command sobernes / and a
measurablenes in aparayle / and tempera^ce in adournynge of the body.

Let be rehearsed also to my lords these monks / chanons / and religious men /
the laws that command them to go the strait way / that leads unto heaven:
leauyng the broad way of the world: that commands them not to turmoile them
self in busynes / another secular nor other: That command / that they sewe
not in princis courts for erthly things. For it is in the counsel of
Calcidinens / that monks ought only to give them self to prayer and fasting
/ and to the chastynge of their flesh / and obseruyng of their rules.

Above all things let the laws be rehearsed / that pertayne and concern you
my reverent fathers and lords / bishops / laws of your just and canonical
election / in the chaptres of your churches / with the calling of the holy
ghost. For because that is not done now a days / And because prelates are
chosen often times more be favor of men than by the grace of god: Therefore
truly have we not a few times bishops full little spiritual / men rather
worldly than heavenly / sauouryng more the spirit of this world than the
spirit of Christ.

Let the laws be rehearsed of the residence of bishops in their diocesis: that
command / that they look diligently / and take heed to the health of souls:
That they sow the word of god: That they show them self in their churches /
at the leest on greatte holy days. That they do sacrifice for their people:
That they here the causes and matters of pour men: That they sustain
fatherles children and widows: That they exercise them self in works of
virtue.

Let the laws be rehearsed of the good bestowyng of the patrimony of Christ.
The laws that command that the goods of the church be spent / not in costly
byldyng / not in sumptuous apparel / and pompis: not in feastyng and
bankettynge: not in excess and wantonness: not in enrichinge of kyns folk: not
in keeping of dogs / but in things profitable and necessary to the church.
For when saint Augustine / some time bishop of England / did ask the pope
Gregory / how that the bishops and prelates of England / should spend
their goods / that were the offringes of faithful people. The said pope
answered (and his answer is put in the decrees / in the.xij. chap. and second
question) that the goods of bishops ought to be divided in to.iiij. parts:
whereof one part ought to be to the bishop and his householde: An other to
his clerks: The third to repair and up hold his tenementes: The fourth to
the pour people.

Let the laws be rehearsed / ye and that often times / that take away the
filthes and vnclenlines of courts: that take away those daily new found
crafts for lucre: that besy them to pulle away this foul covetousness / the
which is the spryng and cause of all evils: The which is the well of all
iniquity.

At the last let be renewed those laws and co^stitutions of fathers of the
celebration of councels / that command provincial councels to be oftener
used for the reformation of the church. For there never happens nothing more
hurtefull to the church of Christ / than the lack both of council general
and provincial.

when these laws / and such other ar rehearsed that be for us / and that
concern the correction of manners / there lacks nothing / but that the same
be put in execution / with all authority and power.

That ones (seeing we have a law) we live after the law. For the which
things / with all due reverence / I call chiefly upon you fathers. For this
execution of the laws / and obseruyng of the constitutio^s / must needs
begin of you / that ye may teach us pristes to follow you by lively
examples: or else trewely hit will be said of you: They lay grievous burdens
upon other men's backs / and they them self will not as much as touch hit
with their little finger.

For sothe if you keep the laws: and if you reform first your life to the
rules of the Canon laws / than shall ye give us light (in the which we may
se what is to be done of our part) That is to say / the light of your good
example: And we seeing our fathers so keeping the laws / will gladly follow the
steps of our fathers.

The clergies and spirituals part ones reformed in the church / than may we
with a just order proceed to the reformation of the lays part: The which
trewely will be very easy to do: if we first be reformed. For the body
follows the soul. And such rulers as are in the cite / like dwellers be in
it. wherefore if pristes / that have ye charge of souls / be good: streyghte
the people will be good. Our goodness shall teache them more clearly to be good
than al other teachynges and prechynges. Our goodness shall compel them in to
the right way / truly more effectuously / tha^ all your suspendynges and
cursings.

wherefore if ye will have the lay people to live after your wysshe and will:
first live you your self after the will of god. And so (trust me) ye shall
get in them what so ever ye will.

ye will be obeyed of them / and right it is. For in the epistell to the
Hebrews / these are the words of saint Paul to the lay people.

Obey (says he) to your rulers / and be you under them. But if ye will have
this obedience: first perform in you the reason and cause of obedience: the
which the said Paul does teach: and hit follows in the text: that is:
Take you head also diligently / as though ye should give a recknynge for their
souls: and they will obey you.

you will be honored of the people: hit is reason. For saint Paul writes unto
Timothe: Pristes that rule well / are worthy double honors / chiefly those
that labor in word and teaching. Therefore if ye desire to be honored:
first look that ye rule well / and that ye labor in word and teaching: and
than shall the people have you in all honor.

you will repe their carnal things / and gether tithes and offrynges without
any stryuynge: right it is. For saint Paul writing unto the Romans / says:
They are dettours / and ought to ministre unto you in carnal things. First
sow you your spiritual things: and than ye shall repe plentifully their
carnal things. For truly that man is very hard and unjust / that will repe
where he never did sow: and that will gether where he never skatered.

ye will have the churches liberte / and not to be drawn before secular iuges /
and that also is right. For hit is in the psalmis. Touch ye not mine anointed.
But if ye desire this liberte: first vnlouse your self from the worldly
bondage / and from the services of men: and lift up your self in to the true
lybertye / the spiritual lybertye of Christ / in to grace from sins / and
serve you god / and raygne in him. And than (believe me) the people will not
touch the anointed of their lord god.

ye would be out of business in rest and peace: and that is convenient. But if
ye will have peace come again to the god of peace and love. Come again to
Christ: in whom is the very true peace of the ghost / the which passes al
wit. Come again to your self / and to your pristly living. And to make an
end / as saint Paul says: Be you reformed in ye newnes of your
understanding / that you sauoure those things that are of god: and the peace
of god shall be with you.

These are they reverent fathers and right famous men / that I thought to be
said for the reformation of the churches estate: I trust ye will take them of
your gentylnes to the best. And if paraue^ture it be thought / that I have past
my bounds in this sermon / or have said any thing out of tempre / forgive hit
me: and ye shall forgive a man speaking of very zele / to a man sorowynge the
decay of the church: and consider the thing hit self / not regarding any
foolysshenes. Consider the miserable form and state of the church: and
endeavor your selfs with all your minds to reform it.

Suffer not fathers / this your so greatte a getherynge to depart in vain.
Suffer not this your congregation to slyppe for naught. Truly ye are gethered
often times to gether: but (by your favor to speak the troth) yet I se not
what fruit comes of your assemblyng / namely to the church.

Go ye now in the spirit that ye have called on / that by the help of hit /
ye may in this your council find out / decerne / and ordeyne those things
that may be profitable to the church / praise unto you / and honor unto god.
Unto whom he all honor and glory / for ever more. Amen.
