A worthy mirror, wherein you may mark, an excellent discourse of a breeding
Lark: By reading whereof, perceive well you may, what trust is in friends or
in kinsfolk to stay.
To the tune of Rogero.


A Lark some time did breed,
within a field of corn:
And had increase when as the grains
was ready to be shorn,
She wary of the time,
and careful of her nest:
Debated wisely with her self,
what thing to do were best.
For to abide the rage,
of cruel reapers hand:
(...) was to perilous,
with safety for to stand.
And to dislodge her brood,
unable yet to fly:
Not knowing whether to remove,
great harm might hap thereby.
Therefore she meant to stay,
till force constraind her fleet:
And in the while for to provide,
some other place as meet.
The better to provide,
the purpose of her mind:
She would forthwith go seek abroad
and leave her young behind.
But first she ^ad them all,
attend their Mothers will:
Which careful was for to eschew,
each likelihood of ill.
This Corn is ripe quoth she,
wherein we ne^^ly dare:
The which if ^eads prevent not harm
might cause our mortal care.
Therefore to sense with skill,
the sequel of mishaps:
We will provide some other place,
for fear of after cla^s.
Whilst I for this and food,
am flowen hence away:
With heedfull ears attentive be,
what comers by do say.
Thus said, she vaunst her self,
upon her longest toe:
And mounted up into the sky,
still singing as she ^low.
Anon she home return^,
full fraught with choice of meat:
But lo a sudden chance, her birds
for fear could nothing eat.
Therewith aghast she cride,
what hoe, what means this:
I charge you on my blessing tell,
what thing has chanst amiss.
Is this the welcome home,
or thanks for food I have:
You wonted were with chirping theere
to gape before I gave.
But now such qualmes oppress,
your former quiet ^ind^:
That quite transformed ^^m mo^e things
(...) souls I ^^^e.
The (...) and eldest bird,
thus chirpt began to say:
Alas (...) dame, such news we herd
since you were flowne away
That were it not the trust,
that we repose in you:
Our lives were lost remediless,
we know it well enough.
The owner of the plot,
came hither with his son:
And said to him this Corn must (...)
it is more then time twere done.
Go get thee to my friends,
and bid them come to morn:
And tell them that I traue their (...)
to reap a piece of corn.
The Lark that was the Dame,
stood in a dump a while,
And after said, his friends quoth she
and then began to smile.
Tush, friends are hard to find,
true friendship (...) appears:
A man may miss to have a friend,
that lives old Nestors years,
True Damond and his friend,
long ere our time were dead:
It was in Greece a great way he^^
where such true love was bred.
Our country is too cold,
to (...) up a friend:
Till proof be made each one w^^^^
still yours unto the end.
But try in time of need,
and all your friends are flowne
Such fruitless seeds, such ^^ckle (...)
in faithless friends be s^wen.
The second part of the breeding Lark.
To the same tune.
Therefore be of good cheer,
^ea^^e your dulled spirits:
(...) the care that caus^es thus,
bercanes you of delights:
Let not (...) fear,
deprive your eyes of sleep.
My self will be amongst you still,
the safely will you keep.
And swear even by the (...),
that grows upon my Crown:
If al his trust be in his friends,
this corn shall not go down.
The young assa^ed by her,
that such an oath did swear:
Did pass the night in wonted sleep,
and banished former fear.
And when the drousy night,
was fled from gladsome day:
She had them wake and look about
for she must go her way.
And said I warrant you,
his friends will not come hear:
Yet not withstanding listen well,
and tell me what you hear.
Anon the farmer came,
me^ged well ^y mad:
And said who so dep^nds on friends,
his case is worse then bad.
I must go fetch my kin,
to help me with this gear:
In things of greater weight then this
their kindred shall appear.
The Larkes their dame returned:
informed her of all:
and how that he himself was gone:
his kindred for to call.
But when she heard of kin,
she laughing cried amain:
A pin for kin a fig for fre^nds,
yet kin the worst of thtwaine.
This man himself is poor,
though wealthy kin he have:
And kindred now a days does fail,
when need compells to crave.
No no he shall return,
with ill contented mind:
His pains shall yield but loss of time
no comfort shall he find.
They all are so adi^t,
Unto their private gain:
That if you lack power to requite,
your suites are all in vain.
My self a^ o^^charg'd,
with harvest as you see:
And nearer is my skin then shirt,
thus shall their answer be.
Therefore as erst of friends,
so say I now of kin:
We shall receive no hurt by this,
nor he no profit win.
Yet listen once again,
what now his refuge is:
For kindred shall be like to friends,
be well assurd of this.
I must go furnish up,
a nest I have begun:
I will return and bring you meat,
as soon as I have done.
Then up she came the clay,
with such a lusty lay:
That it reioyc'd her yonglings hearts
as in their nest they lay.
And much they did commend,
their lusty mothers gate:
And thought it long till time had brought
themselves to such a state.
Thus as their twinkling eyes,
were roving to and fro:
They saw whereas the farmer came
who was their mortal foe.
Who after due complaints,
thus said he in the end:
I will from henceforth^trust my self
and not to kin or friends.
Who gives me glossing words,
and fails me at my need:
May in my pater noster be,
but never in my creed.
My self will have it done,
since it must needs be so:
For proof has taught me so much wit
to trust to any more.
The birds that listening lay,
attentive to the same:
Informed their mother of the whole,
as soon as ere she came.
Yea Marry then quoth she,
the case now altered is:
We will no longer here abide,
I always feared this.
But out she got them all,
and trudgd away apace,
And through the Corn she brought them al
unto another place.
God send her luck to escape,
the hauk^ and foulers g^^^e:
And me the hap to have no need,
of neither friend nor kin,
Finis.
