Regnique Sueciae Commissariis de Induciis admodum sequentem convenimus,
statuerimus and concluserimus.

I.
SInt Iuduciae ex hoe die inter Serenissimum Principem and Dominum, Dominum
Vladislaum IV. Regem Poloniae, Magnum Ducem Lithvaniae, etc. Dominum nostrum
clementissimum, Suae Majestatis successores, Reges Poloniae Magnos Duces
Lithvaniae, Regnumque Poloniae and Magnum Ducatum Lithvaniae, ex una, and inter
Serenissimam Principissam and Dominam, Dominam Christianam, Svecorum,

etc. Suae Majestatis successores, Reges Svecorum, Regnumque Sveciae, ex altera
part, annis sequentibus viginti sex a data praesentium computando, usque ad
primam Iulii, stilo veteri Anno M.DC.LXI.

II.
Sit omnium utrinque ante actorum amnistia. Jmprimis Sac: Regia Majestas,
ejusque Successores. Reges, Regnumque Poloniae, and Magni Ducatus Lithaviae
abstineant durantibus induciis omni hostilitate, adversus Reginam, Regnumque
Svecorum iisque mediate vel immediate subjectas Provincias, Castra, Civitates,
ac Territoria, neque quicquam perse, vel per alios moliantur, aut tentent,
tentarive faci^nt in horum detrimentum aut praejudicium. Ad eundem modum
Serenissima Regina ejusque Successores, Reges Regnumque Sveciae abstineant
durantibus Jnduciis omni hostilitate adversus Regem, Regnumque Poloniae, and
Magnum Duc^tum Lithvania, iisque mediate vel immediate subjectas Provincias,
Castra, Civitates ac Territoria, neque quecquam perse vel per alios moliatur,
tentent, tentarive facrant, in horum detrimentum and praejudicium.

III.
Serenissimo Regi ae Reipub. Polonae, Serenissima Regina Regnumque Sveciae
reddat came partem Prussiae, quam hactenus occupatam possidet, ita tamen, ut
Pillavia Electori Brandenburgico Duci in Prussia immediate restituatur;
possidenda eojure, quo ante hoc bellum habuit.

IV.
In restituendis vero locis, hoc observetur: ut exhibita Commissariis Svevicis
Regis Poloniae ratificatione, nec non interposit a Senatorum cautione, and
Commissariorum Polonicorum lege comitiali ad latus Regis a Rep. delegatorum, de
tradenda primo quoque tempore Reip. ratificatione, Mariaeburgum cum Jnsula
majori, Stuma, Brunsberga, ac Tolckemitum, cum eorum territorriis, deductis
praesdiis reddatur in manus Commissariorum Regis ac Regni Poloniae. Hauptium
vero and Iunckertreil praesentibus utriusque partis deputatis solo aequentur,
suis cuique fundis and bonis relictis: and exercitus utrinque abducantur intra
id tempus, codem modo and ordine, quo inter Generales utriusque partis
convenerit. Elbingam vero cum pristino ejus Territorio, atque insula minori ac
munimentis ibi exstructis, nec non Pillaviam cum ea part Neringiae, quae eo
spectat, retineat sua Regia Majestas Regnumque Sveciae, donec ratificatio Reip.
Polonae subsecuta fuerit: qua tradit a, illa quoque loca intra dies
quatuordecim, deductis sine damno Jncolarum praesidiis restituat. Hoc
observato, ut fortalitia omnia Elbingae exstructa, relinquantur omnia eo
instatu, in quo nunc sunt, and eadem custodia ut ante hoc bellu^.

V.
Post restitutionem locorum omnium vectigalia in eum mox redigantur statum, and
in illud ius, in quo erant ante hoc bellum, servata in omnibus aequalitate, uti
antea fuit.

VI.
Acta, iudicata, ac decreta cujuscunque fuerint instantiae, vel judicu,
inscriptiones, contractus, transactiones, aliaque omnia, quae statui publico
uti is fuit ante bellum, non derogant, vel hiscep ctis per expressum non sunt
reservata, belli vel induciarum tempore, sive Magistratuum authoritate, and
judicialiter gesta, firmum robur obtineant, aeque ac si priore rerum statu
omnia acta fuissent, nec ulla unquam regimims and Magistratuum mutatio
intervenisset.

VII.
Jn Livonia utraque pars, uti praeteritis sexennalibus induciis possedit, ita
hisce quoque possideat.

VIII.
Rex ac Resp. Bolona receptas in fidem suam Civitates ac Territoria, eorumque
Magistratus, Communitates; Ciues, Jncolas and subditos universos omni meliore
modo indemnes, praest et, ac eadem, quo olim, Clementia and Grati^a
prosequatur, foveat ac tueatur: gaudeantque universi and singuli
possessionibus, juribus, Privilegiis, consuetudinibusque, suis, (tam
generalibus ac communibus, quam specialibus) sine exceptione, quibus ante hoc
bellum gavisi sunt: praesertim vero Civitas Elbingensis in usu s^gills terrarum
Prussiae, and consueto sessionis loco conservetur, postquam debitum suae Regiae
Majestati Juramentum fidelitatis praestiterit, salvo manente libero in locis
restitutis, uti antea viguit. Evangelicae Religionis exercitio, manente quoque
libero Catholicae Religionis exercitio, in templo praesertim Parochiali Veteris
Civitatis Elbingensis uti ante bellum.

IX.
Cunctae actiones adversus illos, qui parts Ser^nissimo^um Regum ac Reginae
Sveciae quocunque modo secuti sunt, aut secuti esse insimulantur, cujusque sint
status and ordinis, five privati vixerint, vel officio publico functi, ac
servitiis Sacrae Regiae Majestatis, Regnique Sueciae obstricti fuerint, vel
instituendae, vel institutae, cessent, and si quae intentatae sunt, tollantur,
omnique careant executione in perpetuum, nec quisquam de iis, quae belli,
Jnduciarumve tempore ex occasion ejusdem belli vel induciarum intercesserunt*
cui quam respondere teneatur. Et si quid in contrari^^m susceptum, factumve
est, aut rescriptum vel decretum aliquod in absentia partis obtentum, id omne
sit irritum, ^^lliusque valoris.

X.
Si cui, aut quibus non placuerit in restitutis Civitatibus aut territoriis
manner, sed potius mutato domicilio ad alios se confer, liberum sit in spatio
trium annorum, a data praesentium numerando, sua divendere, aliis locare, aut
pro suo libitu distrahere sine ullo impedimento aut onere, sub quocunque
pretextu imponendo, salvis antiquis Civitatum puribus ac consuetudinibus.

XI.
Si qui exulum, qui extra Sueciam apud Polonos versannur, and parts
Serenissimorum Regum Poloniae secuti sunt, in Patriam redire quacunque de causa
voluerint, salvum quaerant conductum, quo impetrato, fruantur beneficio legum
and statutorum Regni Succiae.

XII.
In locis quocunque tempore juxta praesentia pacta restituendis, relinquantur
bona fide omnia mobilia Ecclesiarum, quae in praesens reperiuntur uti sunt vasa
ac vestes sacrae, campanae, aliaque ad usum Ecclesiasticum servientia, tum
libri Cancellariae, Privilegia and acta publica. Si quae tamen temporum iniuria
a milite sunt direpta, aut aliorum negligentia corrupta, ulterior in id
inquisitio non instituatur, nec quisquam ad restitutionem teneatur. Tormenta
item bellica and Bombardae majores, quae tempore occupationis inventae fuerunt,
and adhuc in restituendis Civitatibus vel locis sunt, celinquantur.

XIII.
De iis, quae durante bello iure fisci cuiquam ademta, and vel Fisco illata,
vel aliis donata sunt; ita convenit, ut immebilia sive Regis and Reip. sive
etiam privatorum sint bona, quorum donationes utrinque factae sunt,
sidonatarits jam tradita sint antiquis possessoribus restituantur, si vero
nondum tradita, maneant penes Dominos: cassantibus de caetero omuibus
quaestionibus, actionibusque ratione reditnum, five expublicis sive privatis
bonis perceptorum. Mobilium eriam donationes and largitiones utrinque factae,
si ante has inducias executioni non fuerint demandatae, irritae sint, traditae
vero possessoribus modernis relinquantur. Cessantibus quoque little nomine
omnibus actionibus, irritisque obligatrunbus, quibus apochae authentice sive a
Regum loca tenentibus, five ab officialibus Camerarum Regiarum, sive and ab
ipsis donatariis, sine frande datae, (dummodo de lisdem donationthus per
authenticum instrumentum constet, solutienis factae) opponi possunt.

XIV.
Commercia pristina inter utrumque Regnum and Provincias subjectas
restituantur, and in veteri exercitio conserventur, redeantque omnia in
eumstatum, in quo ante hoc belliem fuerant, ab omnibus novitatibus, oneribusque
hoc bello indictis vindicata.

XV.
Defluitatio mercium ex Mag. Duc. Lithv. nulla ratione in flumine Duna
impediatur: sitque ea in dicto flumine vectigalium ratio in posterum, quae fuit
ante hoc bellum.

XVI.
Subditifugitivi Mag. Duc. Lith. and Duc. Curland: quicunque in Livonia reperti
fuerint, suis Dominis reddantur: quod vice versade subditis fugitivis ex
Livonia in Mag: Duc: Lith: and Duc: Curland: fieri debet.

XVII.
Exercitus omnes, (exceptis praesidiariis) tempore supra definito ab utraque
part ex Provincia deducantur: and quidem Suecicus per mare, si tamen equitatui
intra assignati temporis spatium traijciendo nav^^m copia non suppetierit,
liber illi and innoxius transitus, quam brevissime itinere, per terram in
ditiones ipsorum sine damno Jncolarum Regne Poloniae mediate vel immediate
subjectorum, concedi debet, Quod itidem observetur, si aliqui pedites dicti
Exercitus Suecici dimissi fuerint: Iustiria vere Prafectos indilata bena fide
administretur damnum and injuriam passis.

XVIII.
Injurias tam personales quam reales sub hasce inducias incidentes una pars de
altera non vindic abit, salva jurisdictione ordinaria cujusque partis, sed
justitia ab officialibus and M^gistratibus competenter requiratur, eademque
indilata administretur, severae poenae in violatores pacis, fide public a
roboratae exerceantur: nullaque repressaliae aut arresta, tam terra quam mari
ratione cujuscunque injuriae (^^si justitiae pluribus vicibus legitime repetita
non administretur,) admittantur and si qua ante hoc bellum sive etiam durante
b^llo concessa sunt, cassentur: ita tamen, ut quibus concessa sunt, justitia
administretur.

XIX.
Quod fi quid gravius incidert, quod violationem Pactorum concernere videretur,
dentur utrinque Commissarit qui loco aliquo ad fines Livoniae assignando
conveniant, and controversias exortas sopiant, decidant que.

XX.
Pro majore securitate, and ne quicquam hisce pactis contrarium durantibus
induciis a quopiam committatur, Ordines Regni Poloniae, and Mag. Duc. Lith.
promitrant and fide sube^nt Regem Poloniae and ejus fratres, corumque
Successores ac Posteros durantibus induciis, ex Regno Poloniae Magnoque Duc.
Lith and omnibus ejus subjectis Provinciis, at que ditionibus nihil molituros,
multo minus hostile quie quam tentaturos, adversus Serenissimam Reginam,
ejusque Successores, Reges, Regnumque Sueciae, ejusque subjectas ditiones ac
Provincias, Civitates, Castra, Munimenta ac Territoria, and si quicquam
tentaverint, id impedire, ac praevenire teneantur.

XXI.
Sacrae Regia Majestas and Resp. Polona adversus Sereniss. Reginam ejusque
Successores, Reges, Regnum que Sueciae, subjectasque ditiones, ac Provincias
nullis navibus vel Class Maritima utatur, vel aliis quibuscunque auxilio
submittat durantibus Induciis. Et Dux in Prussia, Dux Churlandiae, and ex
statibus Prussiae Regalis, Civitates majeres caveant, se non permissures
hostile quicquam ex portubus suis Reginae, Regnoque Sueciae, subjectisque
ditioni^^^ ac Provinciis, illatum iri direct vel indirecte

XXII.
Durantibus ac currentibus hisce Jnduciis, agatur de Pace perpetua loco ac
tempore (interventu, Principum Mediatorum) de quibus inter parts, cura ac
diligentia illustris. Duc: Churl, convenerit. Ita tamen ut si tractatus Pacis
perpetuae semel aut iterum non successerit, firmae nihil ominus and
inviolabiles maneant Jnduciae, usque ad exitum ^^^^e pa^tis praefinitum.

XXIII.
Si qui Regum ac Principum Christianorum hisce pactis ex utraque part includi
voluerint, sit ipsis ejus facultas: modo se ad ista intra quinque abhinc menses
declaraverint.

XXIV.
Vt hisce pactis firmius insistatur, certeque constet, bona ^de ea servatum
iri, hoc modo convenit, ut redditis utrinque Procuratoriis Dominorum
Commissariorum, pacta haec manu and sigillo eorundem roborentur and invicem
tradantur. Tum ut Seren. Rex Poloniae secundum praescriptam formu^^^ ^adem
quanto citius confirmet, and antequam ullius loci fiat restitutio suam
Confirmationem tradat. Deinde ut Sacra Sueciae solennni instrumento, illa
nomine suo ac Regni Sueciae, per superscriptionem Dominorum Regni Sueciae
Administratorum rata habeat. Et Respublica Polona eadem in Comitiis primo
quoque Tempore celebrandis, solenniter approbet, and confecto Jnstrumento
ratificet. Quae quidem Instrumenta solennia, ad formulam praescriptam, nulla
voce aut syllaba mutata; per utriusque Partis Commissarios Deputatos quanto
citius poterit, ad limits Territoriales inter Elbingam and Mariaeburgum, sine
ulla mora and excusatione reddi utrinque ac recipi debebunt. Ad eundem modum
Serenissimus Elector Brandenburg, Dux in Prussia, Dux Churlandiae, and ex
Ordinibus Regalis Prussiae Civitates Majores literas tuas Reversales, quibus
Securirati. S. R. M. ac Regni Sueciae cavebitur, ant e restitutionem Elbingae
and Pillaviae tradant.

Amsterdam: and Ioachim Andrea, Counselor in the highest Court of Frizeland:
having entered into the said Treaty of Peace, and for a long-while, many ways
too and again consulted thereupon; to this issue, at length; (the divine
goodness graciously therein favoring us, and the right Honorable
Ambassadors aforesaid, taking indefatigable pains in it) we brought the whole
business; as that we fully agreed, determined and concluded upon the Peace,
with the forementioned Commissioners of her Majesty, and of the Kingdom of
Sweden, in manner and form following.

I.
LEt the Peace, betwixt the High and Mighty Prince Vladislaus the fourth, King
of Poland, Duke of Lettow, etc. our gracious Lord and Master; his Majesty's
successors, Kings of Poland, nd great Dukes of Lettow; as also the Kingdom of
Poland, and great Dukedom of Lettow, on the one party, and the High and mighty
Princess and Lady, the Lady Christina, designed Queen of the Swedens, Goths
and Vandals great Princess of Finland, etc. Her Majesty's successors Kings of
Sweden, as also the Kingdom of Sweden, on the other party: be continued from
this day forward, for XXVI. years to come; to be accounted from the date of
these presents, until the first of July, (old style) in the year of our Lord
1661.

II.
Let there be an utter forgetfulness of all fore-passed matters, on both
sides. And, in the first place, let his sacred Majesty, and the Kings his
successors, as also the whole Kingdom of Poland, and great Dukes of Lettow:
abstain during the whole time of the said Peace, from all manner of hostility
against the Queen and kingdom of Sweden; and the Countries, Castles, Cities
and Territories, mediately or immediately belonging unto them: yea, and neither
by themselves or any others, Let them complot, attempt, or cause to be
attempted any thing, in derogation or infringement of these Articles. In like
manner, Let her Majesty the Queen, with the Kings her successors, and Kingdom
of Sweden, forbear for all the time of this Peace, from all actions of
hostility against the King and Kingdom of Poland, and great Dukedom of
Lettow; and against all the Countries, Castles, Cities, and Dominions, either
mediately or immediately subject unto them; yea, and neither by themselves or
by any others, let them complot, attempt, or cause to be attempted, any thing
in derogation or infringement of these Articles.

III.
Let her Majesty and Kingdom of Sweden, restore unto his Majesty and Kingdom
of Poland, all that part of Prussia, as yet in their possession. Yet so, that
the Pillaw be immediately restored unto the Elector of Brandenburgh. Duke in
Prussia, to be holden by the same right, as before this war he still enjoyed
it.

IV.
But in restoring of places; let this one thing be observed, that upon the
Ratification (of this Peace) by the King of Poland, caution being also laid in
by the States, as also by certain Polish Commissioners by Act of Parliament
sent from the Commonwealth unto the Kings presence, with assurance of
delivering the Ratification (of this present Peace) of the Commonwealth so
soon as conveniently may be: Marienburg with the * greater Jland, The Gosie
Werder by Marienburg.
Stum, Brunsberg, and Tolkemit, with their Territories, the (Swedish) garrisons
being first drawn our; be rendered up into the hands of the Commissioners of the
King and Kingdom of Poland. But as for Haubt and Junckertreil, let them be
demolished even with the ground, in presence of certain Deputies for both
parties; the lands and goods belonging to them being restored to their owners.
Let the Armies also on both sides be drawn off, within that time, in the same
order and manner as shall be agreed upon betwixt both the Generals. As for
Elbing and the territory anciently belonging to it, with the lesser Island, and
the Fortifications therein erected; as also the Pillaw, with that part of
Neringen which belongs unto it; her Majesty and the Kingdom of Sweden may so
long keep possession of them, until the foresaid Ratification of the Kingdom
of Poland be obtained. Which being tendered, her Majesty is to deliver up these
places also within 14. days, and to draw out all her Garrisons, without
hurt-doing to the inhabitants. This being therewithal observed, that all the
Fortifications erected about Elbing, be left in the same state they now are,
and under the same government as before these wars.

V
After the restitution of all places, let the tributes be reduced into the same
state and right they were in before these wars: equality being in every thing
observed, as before times.

VI.
All Acts, Judgments, and Decrees, upon what instance or sentence soever
passed: all Writings, Contracts, Transactions, and all Actions, which are no
way derogatory unto the public State, as it was before these wars, or which
are not by express words excepted in this present Agreement; however
concluded, either in the time of War or Truce, by the authority of the
Magistrate and judicially; or otherwise besides the formalityes of the Law: let
them remain in as full strength as if all had been done when things were in
their former condition; and as if no alteration, either in the Government or of
the Magistrates. had happened.

VII.
So much as either party had in their possession in the Country of Leifland,
during the time of the last six years Peace: let them still keep possession
of for all the twenty six years following.

VIII.
Whatsoever Cities or Territories, with their Magistrates, Commons, and
Inhabitants, and Subjects in general, which the King and State of Poland have
heretofore received under their protection; let them henceforth grant free
pardon unto; yea and afford favor, and protect them with the same clemency and
grace, as heretofore: and let all and every of them enjoy the same possessions,
Rights, Privileges and Customs, (as well general and common as special)
without exception, which before the beginning of these wars they have
enjoyed. And especially let the City of Elbing be conserved in the right and
usage of the Seal of the Lands of Prussia, and in the accustomed Seat of
Justice: it having, in the first place, taken the Oath of Fidelity to the Kings
Majesty: the exercise of the Evangelicall religion being left free in the
restored places, as it heretofore has flourished: yea and the exercise of the
Catholic religion, being left free also; especially in the Parish Church of
the old town of Elbing* as it was before these wars.

IX.
All Actions against those persons, which in any kind have taken part with
their Majesty's the King and Queen of Sweden, or that are accused to have sided
with them; of what condition or degree soever they be, whether they have lived
as private men, or have borne any office, or any way been employed in the
service of their said sacred Majesty's, or of the kingdom of Sweden, whether
the said Actions be already commenced or intended so to be, let them be let
fall presently: and if any be already passed, let them instantly be disanulled
and debarred of all further execution for ever. Nor let any man be thereby
engaged to put in Answer to any adversary, upon such things as have been done
in the time either of War or Peace; which have fallen out upon occasion of
the said War or Peace. And if that contrary hereunto, any suit already be
commenced or adjudged, or any Sentence or Order of Law in the absence of the
party be obtained, let it wholly be made word and of no value.

X.
If any person or persons be not willing longer to remain in the restored
Cities or Territories; but rather to change his dwelling and remove unto
another place: let him have free leave within three years from the date of
these presents, either to sell outright, let to farm to others, or otherwise
at his or their pleasures to dispose of his estate, without any hindrance or
taxation upon any pretense to be imposed on them: the ancient Rights and
Customs of the Citizens, being still preserved.

XI.
Whatsoever Exiles now out of Sweden, and living among the Polish Nation, that
have sometimes followed the party of their Majesty's the Kings of Poland, be
willing, upon any occasion, to return into their own Country: let them desire
Letters of Safe Conduct; which being obtained, they may freely enjoy the
benefit of the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom of Sweden.

XII.
In such places, as are at any time by virtue of this present Agreement to be
restored; let all the Church-moveables at this time found in them, be
faithfully left unto them. That is to say, sacred Vessels and Vestments, Bells,
and other Ornaments serving for the Church: as also the Books of their Courts
of Chancerie, their Patents and Public Acts. But if any of them through the
injury of the times have been pillaged by the Soldiers, or by others
negligence have been spoiled: let no further inquiry be made into it, nor any
man obliged to restitution. As for those pieces of Canon and great Ordnance,
which at the time of the taking were found, and are yet remaining, in any of
the Cities or places that are to be restored, let them be there left unto them.

XIII.
As concerning those goods, which in the time of these wars have be the Law
of Atteinder been taken from any person; or which have been confiscated, or
bestowed upon other: it is thus agreed upon That is to say, that the Immovable
goods belonging either to the King or State, or else unto (...) private person,
which are actually already given away, on either side: if so be they be already
deliver dup, into the possession of these to whom they were given: let t em be
again restored to the former owners: but if possession be not already given of
them, let them still remain unto their owners: all Questions and Actions in
regard of any Rents received for them, either of the goods of private men, or
of the State; from henceforth for ever ceasing. As for those Grants or Gifts of
moveable goods, made on either side; if actual possession have not thereupon
been delivered, let the grants become void: but as for such as have been
delivered, let them be still left unto the present possessors. All Actions,
also, in their names ceasing, and all Bonds becoming void; which by such
Acquitances may be discharged, as either by the Kings Lieutenants, or by the
Officers of their Majesty's Chamber, or by the Donors themselves, have
authentically and without fraud been given; provided, that by some authentic
writing of payment heretofore made; there may be a Constat of those Donations.

XIV.
Let the ancient Commerce betwixt either Kingdom and the subject Provinces, be
again restored; and from hence in their ancient Freedom conserved: and let
every thing return into the same estate, where in they were before these
wars: and these discharged from all such novell Impositions and Taxations, as
have these wars been laid upon them.

XV.
Let the passing of Merchandises out of the great Dukedom of Lettow, by the
River Duna, by no means be no longer hindered: yea, and let the same rates of
Customs hereafter be upon that River, which were before the Wars.

XVI.
Let all such Fugitive Subjects of the great Duke dome of Lettow, and Dukedom
of Curland, as are found in Liefland, be retured to their own Lords: which, on
the other side, ought also to be done, with the Fugitive Subjects out of
Liefland, into the great Dukedom of Lettow, and the Duchy of Curland.

XVII.
Let all the Armies (excepting the Garrisons) be on both sides drawn out of
the Country within the time appointed: and the Swedish Army to pass away by
Sea. But in case they should not be furnished of shipping enough by the time
appointed, for wafting over of the Horse; that then the said Horse-forces
should have free passage and unmolested, to march over-land, the nearest way
into their own Dominions: so be it were without wrong-doing unto such
Inhabitants, as either mediately or immediately be Subjects to the Crown of
Poland. Which condition is also to be observed, if any Foot of the Swedish Army
shall be cashiered: present Justice being bona fide to be administered by the
Commanders, unto such as suffer loss, or receive injury by them.

XVIII.
Injuries, whether personal or real, falling out within the time of this
Peace; shall not one part revenge upon another; the ordinary Jurisdiction of
each Party being preserved: but Justice shall orderly be demanded of the
Officers and the Magistrates: which without delaying, let it forthwith be
administered. Let severe punishment be inflicted upon the violaters of this
Peace: which by the public Faith and Honor is now confirmed. And let no
Reprisals or Arrests, either by Sea or Land be allowed; done upon pretense of
any injury whatsoever; unless that Justice has often been demanded, and not
administered. And License for making such Reprisals or Arrests, have during
these wars been made out, let them be held for cancelled: with this proviso,
that Instice be forthwith done, unto whom such Licenses have been granted.

XIX.
But if any weighty occasion shall fall out, which may seem to concern the
breaking of these Articles; let Commissioners be on either side appointed: who
meeting in some designed place upon the Frontiers of Liestland may decide the
late risen Controversies.

XX.
For the more security, and that nothing contrary unto this Agreement, may
during this Peace by any man be committed; let the States of the Kingdom of
Poland, and great Dukedom of Lettow, pass their promise, and engage their
Faiths for the King of Poland, his Brothers, and their Successors; that for all
the time of this Peace, they shall not complot to do any thing, either out of
Poland and the great Dukedom of Lettow, nor out of any of the Countries and
Dominions subject unto them: much less that they shall actually attempt any
action of hostility, against the Queens Majesty or the Kings her Successors,
and the Kingdom of Sweden; or against the Dominions, Countries, Cities,
Castles, Forts and Territories object unto them: yea, and in case the King or
hi^ Brethren, etc. should attempt any such matter; let the States be hereby
engaged, to hinder and to prevent it.

XXI.
The Kings sacred Majesty and Commonwealth of Poland, shall employ no shipping
or Sea-fleet, against her Majesty the Queen, and the Kings her Successors, and
Kingdom of Sweden; or against their Dominions and Subject Provinces: nor shall
send such aid unto others against them, during all the time of the said Peace.
Also the Duke in Prussia, The Marquess Elector of Brandenburg.
the Duke of Curland, and of the States of that part of Prussia belonging to
the King, Of Poland.
let the greater Cities put in caution, that they will not suffer any
hostility, either directly or indirectly, out of their Ports to be sent against
the Queen and Kingdom of Sweden, and the Dominions and Countries to them
subject.

XXII.
During this present Peace, and before it be expired, let another Treaty be
propounded for the perpetuating of it in such place and time, (by the
intervention of the Princes Mediators) as shall be agreed upon by both the
parties, brought to it by the care and diligence of his Highness the Duke of
Curland. Yet so, that if this Treaty for a perpetual Peace, succeeds not at
the first or second time, yet let the present Truce remain firm and
inviolable, unto the full term prefixed in this Agreement.

XXIII.
If any Kings or Princes Christian, be desirous to be on either Party included
within this Peace, let them hereby have liberty to do it: upon condition, that
they declare themselves for it within five months.

XXIV.
To the intent this present agreement may the more firmly be relied upon, and
that it may assuredly be made appear, it shall bona fide be observed; it is in
this manner concluded upon. That the Exceptions of the Lords Commissioners
being on both sides returned back again, let these Articles be confirmed with
their hands and Seals, and mutually be delivered. Then, that his Majesty the
King of Poland, may according to this present prescript form, confirm it with
all speed possible, and deliver up that his Confirmation, before any place be
restored. Then, that her sacred Majesty of Sweden may also ratify it by a
solemn Instrument, in her own name and the Kingdom of Sweden, by the
Subscriptions of of the Lords Administrators of the Kingdom of Sweden. And
that the State of Poland, in their Parliament with all speed to be convoked,
may solemnly approve of it, and in an Instrument drawn to that purpose ratify
it. Which said solemn Instruments, in this present form prescribed (not so
mvch as one word or syllable being altered) shall with all speed possible, by
the deputed Commissioners on both sides, without any delay or excuse, upon the
Frontiers betwixt Elbing and Marienburg, be mutually delivered and received. In
like manner, his Highness the Elector of Brandenburg, and Duke in. Prussia,
the Duke of Curland, and of the States of Prussia, on the Kings side, the
greater Cities, shall deliver their Letters Reversalls, in which Caution shall
be laid in, for the security of her Majesty and the kingdom of Sweden, before
such time as Elbing and the Pillaw be restored.
