Of the Summer time.
ALl Globes (according to the Axiom) whose Axio^ of Prouolution are parallel
in one obliquely one to another: so our or be Axis, inclining to the Sphericall
body of light, prouolueth surface to surface with obliquation and paralax, and
now being the xi of June in the nearest point of inclination, shows eury part
of his superficies to the Suns view, with greatest inequalitic and
differance; and consequently this his inclination to greatest show of Sunshine,
and least shadow on the Sun (after the receive often opinion) in the greatest
Northerly declination, making with us, longest day and shortest night: which
either way taken, are usually received for the third part of the Astronomicall
year, Ifind that will be much disposed to heat and drought, (not much
different from his natural inclination) and it will be much disposed to
thunder, not much differing from the dispose of Summer 1616. The Infirmities
are like to be Sweatings, Apostumes, Inflammations, Hecticke, Agues, and other
Infirmities proceeding of Choler.

In this Season we must eat little and often. (as Galen teaches) because we
need more often Nourishing, and Drink more abundantly Wine, being qualified.

Of Autumn.
ANy two Orbs having their motion in a perpendiculer line one to another,
including both their Axis object Plane to Plane, directly each to other: but
our dark obscure opacous, and sphearicall Orb (the xii. of September)
prouoluing himself in such a habitude to the Globe of Lights conuere,
obiecteth each por^ion of his plane in equal plane, to equal elumination, and
so makes day and night alike-long all this world over. The moment of which
habitude, gives the beginning to the last quarter of the Astronomicall year
called Autumn or Harvest.

The Dyscrasit of this time of the year, is the cause of many Diseases, and
will be now the occasion of Consumptions, Strangurie, Goutes, Collicke, and
Illiacke passions, Dropsies; besides many other Phlegmatic griefs.
