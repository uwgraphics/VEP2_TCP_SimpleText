Cum priuilegio ad Imprimendum solum.

WHen the old scrybes and pharisees had darkenid the scripture with their
tradi^ions, false interpretations and wicked persuasions of (...), and shut
up the kingdom of heaven (wc is Gods word that the peeple could not enter in,
into the knowledge of ye true way, as Christ complayneth in the Gospel. Math
xxiii then they sat in the hearts of men, with their false doctrine in the
stead of God and his word, and slew the souls of the People, to devour
their bodies, and to rebuke the^ of their worldly substance. But when christ
and John the baptyst had restored the scripture again unto the true
vnderstandinge^ and had uttered their falsshead and improued their tradicions,
and confounded their false interpretacions with the clear and evident Textes,
and with power of the holy ghoost and had brought all their iugglinge and
hipocrisye to lyghtpunc; there they g^tte the^ unto the elders of the People,
and persuaded them, saying: this man is surely of the Deuell, and his miracles
be of the Deuell no doubt. And these good works which he does in healyng the
people, yea and his preaching against our covetousness / are but ^cloke to
bring him unto his purpose / that when he has got^en hi^ Disciples enough he
may rise against the emperor and make him self King, and then shall the
romans come and take our Land from ^s and carye away our people and put
other nations in our realm, and so shall we lose all that we have / and the
most part of us / our lives thereto. Take head therefore betimes while there is
remedy, yet he go so far yt ye be not able to resyst him.

The elders of ye people which were rich and welthy / though before they in a
manner favored Christ, or at the lest way were indifferent not greatly caring
whether God or the deuell reigned / so they might bide in authority / feared
immediately (as Herod did of the loss of his Kingdom when the Wise men axed
where the new borne King of Jews was) and conspired with the scribes and
pharisees against Christ and took him and brought him unto Pilate / saying: We
have found this fellow peruerti^g the people and forbiddinge to pay trybute
unto Caesar, and saying that he is a king and moving the people from Galylie
unto this place: The^ Pilate (though he likewise was before indifferent / but
now in fear of ye loss of his office through such persuasio^s) slew innocent
Christ. And in very deed as the scribes and pharyseys were all their lives
before blind gydes unto ye destruction of their souls / eue^ so were they at
their last end blind prophets unto ye destruction of their bodies. For after
that they had slay^ Christ and diverse of his apostles, and persecuted those
poor wretches that believed on him / God, to aduenge the poor innocent blood
ye bare witness unto his truth / poured his wrath among the^, that they the^
selves rose against ye Emperor. And ye Romans came (according as they
bli^dlye prophesied) and slew the most part of the^ and carried the rest
captyue into all nations / and put other nations in the Realm. But whose fault
was that insurrectio^ against ye Emperor, and mischefe that followed? Christ's
and his apostles who^ they falsely accused before hand? No, Christ taught that
they should give Caesar that wc perteyned unto Caesar / and god yt wc belo^ged to
God: Eue^ that they should give Caesar their lawful bodily service, and god the
heart, and that they should love gods law, and repent of their evil, and come
and receive mercy, and let the wrath of God be taken from the^* And the
apostles taught y^ all souls should obey the hyer powers or te^porall rulers:
But their obstinate malice y^ so hardened their hearts yt they could not
repent / and their railing upon the open and manifest truth which they coud
not improve, and resysting the holy ghost, and sleynge of y^ preachers of
righteousness, brought the wrath of God upon them, and was cause of their
destruction.

Even so our scribes and phariseys / now that their hipocrisye is disclosed,
and their falshed so brought to light that it can no le^ger be hyd, get them
unto the elders of the people, the lords, gentylmen / and te^porall officers,
and to all that love this world as they do, and unto who soever is great with
the king, and unto the kings grace him self, and after the same ensample and
with ye same persuasions, cast the^ into like fear of losing of their worldely
dominions, and rore unto them / saying, ye be neglygent and care nothing at
all, but have a good spor^e that the heretics rail on us. But give them space
a while till they be growe^ unto a multitude, and then ye shall se them preach
as fast against you, and move the people aginst you, and do there best to thrust
you ^^^me also, and shall c^y havocke and make all comen. O generation of
serpents how well declare ye that ye be the right sons of the father of all
lies? for they which ye call heretics, preach nothing, save that which our
savior Jesus Christ preached and his Apostles, adding naught th^e to, nor
plucking ought therfro / as the scripture commands, and teach all men
repentance to God and his holy law, and faith unto our savior Jesus Christ,
and the Promyses of Mercy made in him / and obedyence unto all that GOD
commands to obey. Nether teach we so much as to resyst your most cruel
tyranny with bodily violence, save with Gods word only: intendinge nothing
but to drive you out of the temple of Christ, the hearts / consciences and
souls of men (wherein with your false head ye sit) and to restore again Jesus
our savior unto his possessyon and inheritance bought with his blood,
whence ye have Driven him with your Manyfold wyles and subtylti^s.

Take heed therefore wicked prelates blind leaders of the blind, indurat^ and
obstinate hipocrites take heed. For if the pharisees for their resisting the
holy ghost (that is to say, persecutyng the open and manifest truth and slaing
the preachers thereof) (...) not the wrath and vengeance of god: how shall ye
escape, wc are far worse then the pharysees? for though the pharisees had
shut up the Scripture and set up their own professions, yet they kept their
own professions for the most part. But ye wylbe the chefest in Christ's
flock, and ye will not keep one jot of the right way of his doctrine. Ye have
thereto set up wonderful professions to be more holy thereby then ye think
that Christ's doctrine is able to make ^ou, and yet keep as little thereof
(except it be* with dispensations) in so much that if a man axe you, what your
marvelous fasshyoned* playing coats and your other popystrye, mean, and what
your disfigured Heads* and al your appes play mean, ye know not / and yet are
they but Signs of things, which ye have professed. Thyrdely, ye will be
papists and hold of the Pope, and yet look in the popes law, and ye keep
thereof a^l most naught at all, but what soever so^ndeth to make for your
bellyes and to mainteyne your honor / whether in the scripture or in your
own traditions or in the popes law that ye compel the lay people to observe
vyolentlye threteninge them with your excomunycatyons and curses that they
shall be dampened both body and soul, if they keep them not. And if that help
you not* then ye murder them mercylesly with the swerd of the temporal
powers, whom ye have made so blind, that they be ready to sle whom ye
command, and will not yet hear his cause exam^ned, nor give hi^ room to
answer for him self.

And yeelders of the people, fear ye god also. For as ye elders of the Jews,
which were partakers with the scrybes and pharisees in resisting the holy
ghost, and in persecuting the open truth, and sleing the witnesses thereof, and
in prouokyng the wrath of God, had their part with them also in y^ ^ay of wrath
and sharp vengeance which shortly after fell upon them, as the nature of the
sin, against the holy ghooste is to have her dampna^ion, not only in ye
world to come / but also in this life according unto all the ensamples of the
bible and auctentike stories sens the world began / even likewise ye, if ye
will wincke in so open and clear light and let your selves be led blind fold
and have your part with the ypocrytes in like sin and myscheue / be sure, ye
shall have your part with them in like wrath and vengaunce / that is like
shortly ^o fall upon them.

And co^cerni^g y^ the hipocrytes put you in fear of ye risi^g of your comens
against you / I answer: If ye fear your come^s, to ^estify yea against your
selves yt ye are tirau^tes. For if your conscience accused you not of evil
doing, what neade ye to fear your comens? What come^s was ever so evil that
they rose against their heads for well ^oynge? Moreover ye witness against
your selves also that ye have no trust in God. For he has promised ye
temporal officers assistence, if they minister their offices truly, and to
care for the ^epinge of them, as much as they care for to keep his laws.

The hipocrites happily bid you take an ensample of the vplandish people of
Almany which they lie that Marten Luther starred up. For first what one
se^te^ce in all the writing of Marten Luther find they that teaches a man to
resist his superior? Moreover if Marten Luther and the preachers had st^rred
up the comen People of Germanye, how happened it that Marten Luther and other
like preachers had not p^risshed like wise with them, which ^IUED Long after?
Ye will ask me who sturred them up then? I axe yo^ Who sturred up the comonnes
of the / Jews to resyst the Emperor, after that the scribes and Pharasees
with the elders of the People had slain Christ and his Apostles? Uerely the
wrath of God. And even so here the wrath of God sturred the^ up / partelye to
destroy the enemies and persecutours of the truth, and partelye to take
vengeance on those carnal beasts / which abused the Gospel of Christ to
make a cloak of it to defend their fleshly liberty / and not to obey it and
to save their souls thereby.

If Kings, Lords, and great men* therefore fear the loss of this world: Let
them fear God also. For in fearyng God* shall they prolonge their days upon
the earth, and not with fyghtyng against God. The earth is Gods only, and
his favor and mercy does prolonge the days of kings in their estate, and not
their own power and might.

And let all men (be they never so great) harken unto this, and let this be an
answer unto them. Wicked king Achab said unto the prophet Elias, Art thou
he that troublest Israel? And Elias answered, it ^s not I that trouble Israel,
but thou and thy fathers household, in that ye have forsaken the
commaundementis of the lord and follow Idolles. Even so the preachers of the
truth, which rebuke si^ne, are not ye troublers of royalmes and comen welthes /
but they that do wickedly, and namely high prelates and mighty princes which
walk with out the Fear of God and live abhomynably corrupting the comen
people with their Ensample. They be they that bring the wrath of God in all
royalmes and trouble all commen welthes, with War / dearth poverty:
pistilence evil lurk and all mysfortune.

And unto all subjects be it said / if they oppress the law of God and
faith of the lord Jesus / and wylbe Christ's discipl^s then let them remember
that there was never man so great a subject as Christ was: there was never
Creature that suffered so great unright, so patiently and so mekely as he /
Therefore what soever they have been in times paste / let them now think that
it is their parts to be subject in the lowest kind of subjection, and to
suffer all things patiently. If the high powers be cruel unto you with
natural cruelty / then with softness and patience, ye shall either (...)
the^ or mitigate their fyercenes. If they join them unto the pope / and
persecut you for your faith and hope, which ye have in the Lord Jesus: then
call to mind that ye be chosen to suffer here with Christ, that ye may joy
with him in the life to com with joy everlasting that shall i^finitly pass
this yo^re short pain here. If they commau^de that God forbids / o^
forbid ye God commands / then answer as the Apostles did A^tes. v. ye God
must be obeyed more then man, if they compel you to suffer unright / then
Christ shall help you to bear, and his spirit shall conforte you. But only
see that neither they put you from Gods word nor yet resyst them with bodily
violence But abide patiently a while till the hypocresy of hipocrites be slain
with the sword of Gods word / and until the word be openly Publysshed
and witnessed unto the Powers of the world, that their blindness may be
without excuse.

And then will God awake as a firce lion against those cruel wolves which
devour his lambs, and will play with the hypocrites, and compass them in
their own wyles, and send them a dasyng in the head, and (...) swemyng in
their brains, and destroy them with their own counsel. And then those
malycious and wylfull blind persecuters, which refusing mercy when they were
called thereto, chose rather to have their part with hipocrites in sheadinge af
innocent blood* shall be partakers with them also in having their own blood
shed again, God geuynge an occasyon that one wicked shall destroy an other.

And as for wyckednes whence it springyth, and who is the cause of all
insurrectyon, and of the faule of princes, and the shortenyng of their days
upon the earth / thou shall se in the glass following, which I have set before
thine eyes, not to resyst the hypocrites with vyolence (which vengeance
perteyneth unto God) but that thou myghtest se their wicked ways and
abominable paths, to wythdrawe thy self from them / and to come again to
Christ and walk in his light, and to follow his steps and to commyt the
keeping both of thy body and soul also unto him and unto the father through him,
whose name be glorious for ever. Amen.

(...) ^xed who should be greatest in the king^^^ of heaven, Christ called a
young child unto him / and set him in the mids among the^* saying: Except ye
turn back and become as children, ye shall not enter in the kingdom of
heaven. Now young children bear no rule one over an other / but all is
fellowshype among them. And he said more over: Whosoever humbles him self
after the ensample of this Child, he is greatest in the kingdom of heaven,
that is, to be (as concerning ambicion and worldely desire) so chyldish* y^ y^
could not heyue thy self above thy brother / is the very bearing of rule
and to be great in Chrysts kingdom. And to describe the very ^a^ion of the
greatenesse of his kingdom / he said: He that receives one such child in my
name receaueth me. What is that to receive a child in Christ's name? Uerely to
subm^^ to meke and to humble thy self and to cast thy self under all men and
to consider all men's infirmities and weaknesses / and to help to heal
their dyseases with ye word of truth / and to live purely that they se no
contrary ensample in the to what soever thou teach them in Christ that thou
put no stumbling block before them, to make them fall while they be yet
Young and weak in the faith: But that thou abstain as Paul teaches.i.
Thessalo. v. Ab omni specie mala, from all that might seem evil or whereof a
man might surmyse amysse, and that thou so love them / that whatsoever gift of
god in the is / thou thynk the same, theirs and their fode and for their sakes
given unto the as the Truth is, and that all the infyrmytyes be thine, and
that thou feale them and that thine heart mourn for them and that with all thy
power thou help to amend them, and cease not to cry to God for them neither
day nor night: and that thou let nothing be found in the / that any man may
rebuke, but whatsoever thou teach them, thou that be: And that thou be not a
wolf in a Lambs skin as our holy father the Pope is, which comes unto us
in Name of hypocrysye and in the title of cursed Cham or Ham calling him self
Seruus seruorum / the seruante of all servants / and is yet found tyrannus
tyrannorum of all tyrau^tes most cruel. This is to receive young chyldern in
christ's name, and to recaue young chyldern in Christ's name, is to bear rule
in ye kingdom of christ. Thus ye may se that Christ's kingdom ^s altogether
spiritual, and the bearing of rule in it is clean contrary unto the bearing
of rule temporallye. Wherefore none that bears rule in it may have any
temporal jurisdiction or ministre any temporal office that requires Uyolence
to compel with all.

Peter was not greater then the other Apostles, by any authority given him of
Christ.
THey say that Peter was chief of the Apostles, verily as Apelles was called
chief of painters for his excellent conning above other, even so Peter may be
called thief of ye Apostles for his actiuitie and boldness above the other: but
that Peter had any authority or rule over his brethren and fellow apostles,
is false and contrary to the scriptur. Christ forbad it the last even before his
passion, and in diverse times before, and taught always the contrary, as I have
rehearsed.

Thou wylt say: thou can not see how there should be any good order in ye
kingdom, where none wear Better then other, and where the superior had not a
law and authority to compel the inferyour with violence. The world truly can
se none other way to rule, then with violence. For there no man absteyneth from
euel / but for fear, because the love of ryghtuousnes is not written in their
hearts. And therefore the Popes kingdom is of this world. For there one sort
are your Grace, your Holiness, your fatherhod: An other, my lord bishop my
Lord Abbot, my Lord Priour / An other / master doctor / father, bachelar /
master parson / master vicar, and at the last comes in simple sir Johan. And
every man reygneth over other with might and have every ruler his prison his
iayler / his chains / his torments / even so much as ye friars obseruauntes
observe that rule, and compel every man either with violence above ye cruelnes
of the heathen tirau^ts, so yt what comes ones in, may never out for fear of
tellyng tales out of scole. They rule over the body with violence and compel
it whether the heart will or not, to observe things of their own making.

But in the kingdom of God it is contrary. For ye spirit that brings the^
thither makes the^ wyllyng and gives the^ lust unto the law of God, and
love compels them to work / and love makes everye man's good and all that
he can do, commune unto his neighbors neade. And as every man is strong in
that kingdom, so love compels him to take the weak by the hand / and to
help him, and to take him, that can not goo upon his shulders and bear him.
And so to do service unto ye weaker, is to bear rule in that kingdom.

And because Peter did excede the other apostles in ferve^t service toward his
brethern, therefore is he called (not in the scripture but in the use of
speaking) the chefeste of the Apostles, and not that he had any dominion over
the^. Of which truth thou may se all thy practice in the A^tes of the
Apostles after the resurrection. For when Peter had been and preached in the
house of Cor +nelis an hethe^ man, the other that were circu^cysed, chode him,
because he had been in an vncyrcumcised ma^s house and had eaten with hi^, for it
was forbydde^ in ye law, neither wist they yet yt y^ hethe^ should be called.
And Peter was feign to give accountes unto the^ (which is not toke^ of
superiorite) and to show the^ how he was warned of the holy ghost so to do
Acts. xi.

And Acts the.xv. when a counsel was gathered of the apostles and dyscyples
about ye cyrcu^cysio^ of the hethe^, Peter brought forth not his commandment
and the auctoryte of his vycarshyppe, but the miracle yt the holy ghost had
showed for the heathen / how at the preaching of the gospel, the holy ghost had
lyghted upon the^ and purytyed their hearts through faith, and therefore pro^ed
that they ought not to be circumcysed.

And Paul and Barnabas brought forth the miracles also that God had showed by
the^ / among the heathen, through preaching of faith. And the^ James brought
forth a prophecy of the old testament for the said party: And there with the
adversaries gave over their hold / and they concluded with one assent by ye
auctorytie of the scripture and of ye holy ghost, you ye heathen should not be
circumcised / and not by the commandment of Peter, under pain of cursing,
excommunycatyon interdytyng and like bogges to make foles and children afraid
with all.

And Acts. viij. Peter was sent of ye other apostles unto the samaritanes /
which is an evident token that he had in iurisdiccion over them (for then they
could not have sent him) But rather (as the truth is) yt the congregation had
auctorytie over him and over all other pryuate Parsons, to admit them for
ministres and send the^ forth to preach whether so ever the sprite of god moved
them / and as they saw occasyon.

And in the Epistle unto ye Gallathians thou seist also how Paul corrected
Peter when he walked not the right way after the truth of the Gospel. Galla.
ij.
So now thou seyst that in the kingdom of Christ, and in his church or
congregation, and in his counsels, Scripture is the chefest of the apostles.
the ruler is the scripture approved through the miracles of the holy ghost and
me^ be servant only* and Christ is the head and we all brethren: And when
we call men our heads, yt we do not, because they be shorn or shaven, or
because of their names, parson, vicar, bisshoppe, pope: But only because of
the word which they preach. If they err from the word / then may who soever
God moves his heart, play pauil* and correct hi^. If he will not obey the
scripture / then have his brethern authority by the scripture to put him
down and to send hi^ out of Christ's church among the heretics which
prefer their false doctrine above the true word of Christ.

How the gospel punissheth trespasers and how by the Gospel we ought to go to
law with our adversaries.
THough yt they of Christ's congregation be all wyl^ing: yet because yt the
most part is always weak and because also that the occasions of the world be
ever many and great, in so much that Christ, which wys^e all thing
beforehande, says Matthew xviij. Woe be unto ye world by reason of occasions of
Evil, and says also that it can not be avoided but that occasyons shall
come, therefore it can not be chosen but that many shall ouerfaule, when a weak
Brother has trespassed, by what law shall he be punisshed? verily by the law of
love / whose properties thou read in ye xiii. of the first to the
Corinthians. If the love of God / which is my profession / be written in mine
heart, it will not let me hate my weak brother when he has offended me* no
more then natural love will let a Mother hate her child when it trespasseth
against her. My weak brother has offended me, he is fallen, his weakness has
ouertrowne hi^: it is not right by the law of love yt I should now faule upon
hi^, and tread hi^ down in ye mire and destroy him utterly: but it is right
by the law of love, yt I run to him and help him up again. By what process
we should go to law with our trespacers / christ teaches us Math. xviij. Tell hi^
his fault between hi^ and the with all meekness, reme^bryng y^ thou art a man
and may fall also: If ye repet, and thou love hi^ / ye shall sone agree / and
the^ forgive hi^. And when thou forgeuest thy neighbor, the^ thou art sure
that god forgeueth the thy trespaces by his holy promysse Math. vi. If he hear
y^ not / the^ take a neighbor or two. If he hear the^ not, the^ tell the
co^gregacio^ where thou art: and let ye preacher pronounce gods law against hi^
and let ye sad and discret me^ rebuke hi^ and exhort hi^ unto repe^tau^ce, if
he repent, and y^ also love him according to ye professyon, ye shall sone agree.
If he hear not ye co^gregacio^, then let him be taken as an hethe^. If he yt
is offended be weak also / the^ let them yt be strong ^o between and help
the^. And in like manner if any sine against ye doctrine of Christ and ye
profession of a christian man so that he be a dronkard, and a^ horekeper, or
whatsoever open sin he do, or if he teach false learni^g: then let such be
rebuked openly before ye co^gregacio^ and by ye authority of ye scripture. And
if they repent not, let the^ be put out of ye co^gregacio^ as he the^ people,
if they the^ be not a shamed ^ we have no remedy but patiently to abide what
god will do and to pray in ye mean time ye god will open their hearts and give
them repentance. Other law then this, Christ's gospel knows not, nor ye
officers thereof. It is manifest therefore, that ye kingdom of christ is a
spiritual kingdom wc no man ca^ mynyster well, and a te^porall kingdom to, as
it is sufficiently proved: because y^ no man which puts his hand to ye
plow, and looks back / is apt for ye kingdom of heaven, as Christ answered
Luke. ix. unto hi^ y^ would have followed hi^, but would first have take leave of
his household. If a man put his hand to y^ plow of gods word, to preach it /
and look also unto worldly business / his plow will surely go a wry. And
therefore says Christ unto a^ other y^ would likewise follow hi^, but desired
first to go and bury his father. Let ye dead bury ye dead, but come thou and
show or preach yt kingdom of god. As who should say, he y^ will preach the
kingdom of God (which is Christ's gospel) truly, must have his heart no where
else.

What officers y^ apostles ordained i^ christ's church, and what their offices
were to do.
Wherefore ye apostles folow^g and obei^g ye rule, doctrine and co^mau^dme^t of
our savior Jesus Christ their master / ordained in his kingdom and
congregation two officers: One called after ye greek word bishop, in english
an ouersear: which same was called preast after ye greek, elder in e^glysh
because of his age, discrecio^ and sadness for he was as nygh as could be all
way a^ elderly man: as thou seist both in the new and old testament also, how
the officers of the Jews be called the Elders of the People / because (as thou
may well think) they were over old men* as nygh as could be. For unto age do
men naturally obey, and unto age does god command to give honor / saying:
Levi. xix. Rise up before the horehead, and reverence the face of the old man
And also experience of things and couldnesse (without which it is hard to rule
well) is more in age then in youth. And this ouersea^ did put his hands unto
the plow of gods word, and fed Christ's flock / and tended them only
without lokyng unto any other business in the world.

An other officer they chose, and called him Deacon after the greek, amynystre
in english, to mynystre the alms of the people unto the pore and neadye. For
in the congregation of christ, love makes every ma^s gift and goods comune
unto the necessyte of his neighbor. Wherefore the love of god being yet hoar
in the hearts of men, the rych that had the substance of this worlds goods /
brought of their abundance great plentye unto the sustentation of the poor,
and delivered it unto the Hands of the Deacons. And unto the help of the
Deacons were wydowes of.lx. year old, holy, virtuous / and destitute of
friends, chosen to tend and wait upon the sick and to wash the saints
fete that came from one Congregation unto an other / whether for any busynes or
for fear of Persecucyon. And these commune goods of the church offered for
the succor of the poor, grew in all churches so Exceadyngly / that in some
co^greg^cion it was so much that it was sufficyente to Maintain an host of
men In so much that tyrants did often times persecute the christen for those
commune goods / as thou seist in the life of. S. Laurence the deacon of Rome.

And moreover the couetuousnes of the prelates was the decay of chrystendome
and the encresyng of the kingdom of Mahomette For by the first springing of
the empire of, Mahomete, the Emperoures, Kings, and great lords of
christendom had given their treasure so myghtely unto the church, what after
great victoryes, and what at their deaths, that their successors were not
able to mainteyne battle against the Saracenes and Turks (for the woorlde was
not yet in such captivity yt they could make their subjects swear on books
what they were worth and raise up taxes at their pleasur) so that a certain
wrytter of stories says: The prelates gaped when the lay men would take the
war upon the^ against the Turks, and yt lay men looked when ye prelates would
lay out their money to make the war with all, and not to spend it in worse
use, as ye most part of the^ were wo^t to do / spending the money that was
gotten with alms and blood of marters upon goodly place and great vessels
of gold and silver, without care of things to come, despising God whom they
worshypped for their belyes sake only and also man. Moreover it was the
custom even then / (says ye auctor) to axe what the bishopryke was worth, ye
and to leave a worse for a better or to keep both with a vnio^. And at ye same
time Isacius the debitie of the Emperor, came to Rome to confirm the Pope in
his se, with the Emperors authority, for the election of ye pope was the^
nothing worth, except it had been confirmed by ye emperor, and he found so
great treasure in the church of saint Ihon Lateran, y^ for dysdayne which he
had yt they should have such treasure in s^ore and not to help the emperor in
his wars against the Turckes seeing his souldyers / lacked wages, he took it
away with violence against the will of ye prelates, of which he exy^ed some /
and paid his own men of war with one part and took an other part unto him
self, and sent the third part unto the Emperor: which must needs have been
a great treasure in one church.

By what means the prelates fell from Christ
THe office of a Bishop was a room at the beginning, that no man coueted and
that no man durst take upon him, save he only which loved christ better then
his own life. For as Christ says that no man might be his disciple, except
that he were ready to forsake life and all: eue^ so might that officer be sure
that it would cost him his life at one time or an other forbeari^g record unto
the truth. But after that the multitude of the christen were increased, and
many great men had receau^d the faith, than both lands and rentes as well as
the other goods, were given unto the maintenance as well of the clergy as of
the poor: because they gave then no tithes to the priests, nor yet now do
save in certain countries: For it is to much to give alms / offeringes /
lands and tithes also. And then the bishops made the^ which they call pryest
/ and keep the name bishop unto them selves.

But out of the deacons sprange all the myschefe. For through their hands went
all thing: they ministered unto the clergy, they ministered unto the poor /
they were in favor with great and small. And when the bisshops office began
to have rest and to be honorable / then the deacons through favor and gifts
clam up thereunto, as lyghtlye he yt has the old Abbots treasure, succedeth
with us. And by the means of their practice and accointau^ce in the world,
they were more subtle and woorldly wise then the old bishops, and less
learned in Gods word, as our prelates are / when they come from
studentshyppe in Gentlemen's houses, and from surueing of great men's lands,
lords secrets, Kings counsels, ambasadourshyp / from war and ministering all
worldly matters / yea, worldly mischefe: and yet now they come not thence /
but receive all and bide there still, The prelates must b^de still in the
court.
yea they have enacted by plain parlyament that they must bide in the court
still or else they may not have pluralytie of benefyces. And then by little and
little they inhaunsed them selves and turned all to them selves minysshynge the
poor peoples part and increasing theyrs, and ioyni^ng accoyntaunce with
great me^, and with their power clam up and entitled the^ which the chosing and
confyrming of the Pope and all bisshoppes, to flatter and purchase favor and
defenders: trusting more unto their worldly wysdom then unto ye doctrine of
Christ, which is the wysdom of God and unto the defense of man, then of God.
Then while they yt had the plowe by the tail, looked ^acke, the plow went a
wrye* Faith waxed feeble and faint / love waxed cold, the scriptur waxed dark,
Christ was no more seen: he was in the mount with Moses, and therefore the
bishops would have a god upon the earth whom they might se, and thereupon they
began^e to dyspute who should be greatest.

How the Bishop of Rome became greater then other / and called him self Pope.
The^ quod worldly wisdom Jerusalem must be y^ greatest for yt was christ's
sete, et factum ^st, so it ca^ to pass for a season And in co^clusio^ where a
great city was and much riches, there was y^ bis^hop ever greater then his
fellows. Alexander in Egypt / and Antioch in Greece / were greater then their
neighbors. The^ those decaying, Constantinople and Rome / waxed great, and
strove who should be greater. And Constantinople said, where the Emperor is,
there ought to be the greatest seat and chefest bishop. For ye Emperor lay^
most at Constantynople / because it was (I suppose) nygh the mids of the
empire, therefore I must be the greatest said the bisshope of Co^sta^tinople.
Nay quod the bisshoppe of Rome, though the Emperor lie never so much at
constantinople yet he is called Emperor of Rome / and rome is the head of ye
e^pyre, wherefore of right I must be the Father of all waten. And thus whether
they challenged their title by ye aucthorite of God or man, or by peter or
poulinge, it was all one: so they might be greatest.

And great intercession was made unto the Emperors of both parties: but in
vain a great season / for the emperors stopped their ears at such ambicious
requests long time, till at the last there came an Emperor called Phocas
which lay long in Italy and was a very soft man and a pray for prelates.
Phocas.
Pope bon^face the (...)
In whose time Boniface ye third was bishop of Rome, a man ambicious and
gready upon honor, and of a very subtle wit nothing inferior unto Thomas wolf
ser cardinal of yorcke. This Boniface was great with the emperor Phocas, and
with his wyly^ persuasions and great intercession together, obtained of Phocas
to be called ye chefest of all bishops, and that his church should be the
chief church. Which auctorite as soon as he had purchased / he sent immediately
his co^ma^dme^t with the emperors power whereunto all the bisshopps of Almanye*
^^mau^di^g ye every bishop should call all the priests of his diocese, the
chastit^ of priests how it came up.
and charge the^ yt every man should put away his wife under pain of
exco^municatio^ Which tyranny, though great resistau^ce was made against it / he
yet brought to pass with the emperors sword and his own subtlety to
gether: for the Bishops were rych and durst not displease the pope for fear
of the Emperor.

As soon as Nemroth y^ myghtie him (...) had caught this pray, that he had
compelled all bishops to be under him and to swear obedyence unto him / then
he began to be great in the earth, and called him self papa, Papa.
with this interpreca^yon / father of fathers. And when the Pope had exalted
his throne above his fellows, then the unity that ought to be among
brethren in Christ's Church, brake: and diuisyon began between us and the
greeks / which greeks (I suppose) were at that time the one half of
chrystendome. Division in the church.
And when any pope ^ens exhorted them to unity they a^swered that he which will
reygne over his brethere^ with violence breaks unity / and not they / and yt
they will not be under his tyranny whereunto he calls them vnd a color of
unite. And from hense forth with the help of his bisshops, which were sworn
t^ be true lyg^ men unto him, when before time they were admitted to their
bisshoprikes of ye emperors and kings, he began to ley abayte to catch the
hole Empire into his hands also.

By what means the pope invaded the Empire.
AT that same ceason Mahomete the auctour of the s^cte of the turckes and
saracens began. mahomete and the p^pe began at ^^ne time.
And as soon as he had got much People unto him with wiles and feigned
miracles, he invaded the empire of Rome in those quarters. And look how busy
Mahomet was in those parties so ^esy was the pope in these quarters to invade
ye empire (with ye help of his sworn bishops which preached all of non other
God then the Pope) while the emperor was occupied a far of, in resisting of
Mahomete. Gregory the pope came up by ye frenchmen and by the he cotinnueth his
estate still.


And within few years after, when the kings of Italy now and then vexed our
holy fathers for the covetouse ambicion, then Gregory ye third joined amite
with the Frenchmen, and called them to help / by whose power they gatte all
they have and also mayntaine it unto this day, For if any man sens that time
hither, dyspleased ye pope never so little, he i^mediatly cursed hi^ and
excommuni^ated him / and proclaimed him no right enheritoure, and that it was
not laufull to hold of him, and obsolu^^ his lords and subjects of their
alleages aunce, and sent his blessing unto the french king, and remissyon of
sins to go and co^quere his land, the pope and french king always dividing
the spoil between them, the bisshops and all that served god for y^ belly,
preaching the popes might* how that he had power so to do / and all things to
b^de and lose at his will / wrestinge the scriptures to serve for their purpose
/ corrupting all the laws both of God and man to prove his godhead with all.

pope zacharias the.i. Hilderichus
THe^ came pope Zacharias ye first, in whose time hulderichus was king of
france / a man y^ governed his royalme (as it often chau^ceth) by a debitie (as
parsones preach) one Pipine a lord of his o^ne and his sworn subject. pipinus
This pipine sent an holy bishop to pope Zacharias that he should help to make
him king of France, and he would be hi^ defender in Italy (as the manner of
^^aul^ horses is, the one to clawe the other) and Zacharias answered that he
was more worthy to be king that ruled the Realm and ^oke the labors, than an
idle shadow yt went up and down and did naught. And so upon that / the lords
of France by the persuasions of the prelates, consented unto Pipine, and
thrust down their right king, unto whom they were sworn, ynd made a monk of
him. And both the lords and also Pipine took dispensacions for their oaths of
our holy father, and were forsworn. Thus was our holy father the Pope crepte
up in to the consciences of men with his false interpretation of byndyng and
lo^synge, good.viij. hundred years agone.

Then came Pope Stephanus the second out of whose hands Estulphus king of
Lombardie would feign have scratched some what, pope steue^ the second estulphus
for he thought that the holy fathers gathered to fa^^^ / and had all ready
raked to much unto them. But the new king Pipine of france warned of his
duty and service promised and mindful of old frendshippe, and hoping for
part of the pray, came to succoure the pope and when he had subdued the King
o^ Lombardye, he gave unto our holy father or rather to saint Peter that hungry
beggar, great provinces and contreys in Lombardye and in Italye, with the isle
corsica and many great cities, of which some perteyned unto the Emperor
being then at Constantinople / and yet the Emperor had sent before unto king
Pipine that he should not give of his towns unto the pope. But Pipine answer^^
that he came for the same intent, and to inhaunce our holy father. And our holy
father received them.

And thus the Empire was divided in two part^s: the Pope and the frenchking
partyng the one half between them. And as the Emperor decayed, the Pope
grew. And as the pope grew, so the sect of Mahomete grew, for the Emperor
(half his empire lost) was not able to defend him self against the infidels.
And the pope would suffer no help hence to come for two causes: One, lest the
Emperor should recover his Empire again, and an other because ye prelates of
ye greeks would not submit them selves unto his godheade as ye prelates of
these quarters of ye world had ^one.

AFter Pipine raygned his son great Charles who^ we call Charlemayne wc knew
non other God but ye Pope nor any other way to heaven then to do the Pope
pleasure. Pipine Charlemayne
For the Pope ser^ed him for two purposses: One to dispe^^^ with him for what
soever mischefe he did: an other, to be stablished in the Empire by his help,
for without his favor he wist it would not be / so great a God was our holy
father become already in those days.

It Is pope steven in his latter days fell at variaunce with Desiderius king of
Lo^bardye, about the archbisshoppe of Ra^enna.

AFter Steven succeeded Adria^ ye first with whom Desiderius the king of
Lombardy would feign have made peace, but Pope Adrian would not. Steven.
Desiderius king of lombardy.
And shortly upon that the brother of this Charlmayn which raygned with him in
half the dominion of France, dyed, whose wife for fear of charles, fled with
her.ij sons unto Desiderius king of Lo^bardye for succoure. Desiderius was
gladd^ of their coming trusting by the means of these two chylderen to
obtain favor among many of the Frenchmen, and so to be able to resyst
charles, if he would meddle* and to bring Italy unto the right Em^perour again,
and would have had that pope Adrian should have anointed them kings in their
fathers room. But Adrian refused that to do (for he saw charles mygh^e and
mete for his purpose) and was as wilye as Desyderius, and thought to keep out
the right Emperor and be Emperor of Rome him self, though he gave an other
the name for a ceason till a more convenient ^ime came.

Then Desiderius warred upon the popes jurisdiction. And Adryan sent to Charles
/ and Charles came with his army and dra^e out desyderius and his son, which
son fled unto the right Emperor to Constantinople. And Charles and the Pope
dyuided the kingdom of Lombardy between them And Charles came to Rome And the
Pope and he were sworn together that who soever should be ennemy unto the one,
should be ennemy also unto the other.

This Adrian gathered a counsel immediately of an.C.lii^. bisshoppes, abbottes
and relygious parsones, and gave unto Charles and his successors the empire of
Rome, and ordained that the right and power to chose the pope* should be his* and
that no bishop should be consecrate till he had obtained of him both consent
and the ornaments of a bishop also (which they now ^ye of the pope) under
pain of cursing, and to be delivered unto black Satan the deuell / and loss
of goods. Did. lxiij.

And Leo the third which succeeded Adrian, confyrmed ye same / and crouned
Charles Emperor of Rome for like service done unto him. And then there was
apointment made between the Emperors of constantinople and of Rome and the
places assigned how far the borders of either empire should reach^ And thus of
one empire was made twain. And therefore the empire of co^sta^tinople for lack
of help, was shortly after subdued of the Turks.

The said Leo also called Charles the most christen King because of his good
service: which title the kings of France use unto this day / though many of
them be never so unchristened* As the last Leo called our king the defender
of the faith. And as this Pope Clemens calls the duke of Ge^der the eldest
son of the holy (...) of ROME, for non other virtue nor propertye y^ any man
can know save that he has b^ne all his life a pickequarell and a cruel and
unrighteous bloudeshedde^^ as his father that sits in that holy se is. So
now above seven hundred years to be a Christen king, ^s to fight for the Pope,
and most chr^sten that most fyghteth and sl^^eth most men for his pleasure.

^he life of Charles
This Charles was a great co^querour that is to say a great tiraunte / and
overcame many nacyons with the sword, and as the Turk compels unto his
Faith, so he compelled them with violence unto ye faith of Christ, says ye
stories. But (alas) Christ^ faith whereunto the holyghost only draws men's
hearts through preaching the word of truth and holy living according thereto,
he knew not, but unto the pope he subdued them and unto this supersticious
ydolatry, wc we use clean contrary unto the scripture.

Practyse.
Moreover at the request and great desire of his mother, he married the daughter
of Desyderius king of Lombardy / but after one year unto the great dyspleasure
of his mother he put her a way again: but not without the false subtiltye of
the pope thou may be sure, nether with out his dispensacion. For how could
Charles have made war for the Popes pleasure with Desiderius her father, and
have thruste him out of his kingdom, and banysshed his Son for ever,
deuydinge his kingdom between him and the pope as long as she had been his wife?

And therefore the pope with his auctorit^ of byndynge and lousinge / lowsed the
bo^des of that matrimony (as he has many other sens, and daily does for like
purposses) to the intent that he would with the sword of the french king put
the Kingdom of Lombardye that was somewhat to nigh him ^ out of the way: by the
reason of whose kings his fatherhode could not raygne alone nor assygne or
sell the Bysshoprykes of Italy to whom he lusted and at his pleasure.

He kept also.iiij. concubines, and lay with two of his own daughters thereto.
And though he wist how that it was not unknown, yet his lusts being greater
the^ great Charles, he would not wete nor yet refrain.

And beyond all that, the saying (...) y^ in his old age a whore had so
bewitched him with a ryng and a pearl in it, and I wot not what ymagerye
graven therein that he went asaute after her as a Dog after a bytch / and the
do^ehed was beside himself and hole out of his Mind: in somuche yt when the
whore was dead, he could not depart from the Dead Corpse, but caused it to be
Enbaulmed and to be Carried with him whether so ever he Went / so that all the
world wondered at him / till at the last his lords accombred with caryenge
her from place to place, and asshamed that so old a Man, so great an
Emperor and such a most christen king, on who^, and whose deeds every Man's
eyes were set, should dote on a dead hoar, took counsel what should be the
cause. And it was concluded that it must neades be by enchauntement. Then they
went unto the cophyne, and opened it and sought, and found this ring on her
finger: which one of the lords took of and put it on his own finger. When the
ringe was of he, commanded to burye her, regarding her no longer. Nevertheless
he cast a phantasye unto this Lord and began to dote as fast on him, so
that he might never be out of sight: But where our Charles was / there must
that lord also be, and what charles did, that must he be preuye unto: until
that th^s lord perceauing that it came because of this enchaunted ring / for
very pain and tedyousnesse^ to^^ and cast it into a well at ac^n in douchland
And after y^ the ring was in the well* the Emperor could never depart from
the town / but in the said place where the ring was, cast though it were a
foul ma^resse, yet he bylt a goodly monasterye in ye worship of our lady, and
thither brought relikes, from whence he could get the^ ^a^d pardons to
sanctifye the place and to make it more hau^ted. And there he lies and is
(...) saint / as right is. For he did for christ's vicar as much as the great
Turk for mahomete: but to save his Holiness that he might be canonysed for a
saint, they feign in his life that his abydyng / there so continuallye was for
the hot bathes sakes with be there.

AFter Charlemain, jews ye mil^ was emperor wc was a very pacie^t man (an
other pho^^^ and an other pray for ye pope) and so meke and soft, that
sca^elye he could be angrye ^f any thing at all. When our holy fathers had
seen his water and spyed what complexion he was / they chose Steven ye iiij. of
the name Pope with out his knowledge and bad him another good morrow nor good
eue^ nor once god speed about the matter, pope steue^ (...).iij.
against their own grant unto his father for his good service. And his softnes
was yet somewhat dyspleased there with in as much as the electyon of the Pope
partayned unto his right. But the Pope sent Ambassadoures and wrote all the
excuses that he coud and came after him self to france to him, and pleased him
and crouned him ye ^e emperor and passed the time a ceason with him, and they
became very famylier to gether.

After that, they chose Paschalis pope of ye same manner, pope paschale.
which phascalis sent immediately legates unto the emperor soft jews excusing
him self and saying: that it was not his fault but that the clergy and the
comen people had drawn him thereto with violence against his will. Then ye
emperor was conte^t^or that ones and bad they should no more do so, but that ye
old ordinance ought to be kept. The softness of this Jews did him much
care. For he was after presoned of his own sone (...) help of pope Gregory
the fourth.

After this man's days the popes never regarded the Emperors / nor did the
clergy of Rome sue any more to the emperor, either for the election or
co^firmacio^ of the pope. Moreover after this Jews there was nev emperor in
christe^do^ of any power or able of his own might to correct any pope nether
was there any king yt coud correct ye outrages vices of the spyritualty of his
own realm after this time For this Jews left.iij. sons among which he
divided the realm of France and all douchlo^d. Which same for pride and
disdayn^ that one should have more then another fell to gether (as we say) by
the ears / each destroyeng others power / so that france was afterward of no
might to do any great thing. And the^ the pope reigned in Italy alone without
care of any Emperor: Alone pope Niclaus the.i.

And after yt Adria^ ye second was chose^ pope ye e^perours debite being in
Rome and not ones spoken to of the matter.

And when the emperors ambassadoures disdained, they answered who can resist
ye rage of the people, and prayed the^ to be content and to salute him as pope.
And Adrian the third decreed that they should not abide and tarry for the
Emperors confirmation or authority in chosing the pope, and hat^ the pope
only should call a general council, and not the emperor, or if the Emperor
would presume that to do, the council should be of none effect / though all
the prelat^ of chrystendom were there, and though what soever they did were but
GODS word. So mighty was the beast now waxed when he ones began to raygne
alone. And from this time h^therwarde perysshed ye power of the Emperors and
the virtue of ye pores, says platina in the life of popes. For sins that time
as there was none emperor of might, so was there no pope of any virtue

Alter this jews, the empire of France and of all doutchlande was divided
between his three sons which (as I said) fought one with an other and
destroyed ye strength of the empire of france. And from that time to this,
which is above.vij. hundredth years, thou shall read of few popes that have
not led their lives in bloudsheading / in so much that if thou consydre the
stories well, thou shall easily perceive that there has been slain about their
cause far above.xl.C. thousand me^, besides yt there has been but few
princes in christendom that has not been busyed and co^bred a great part of
his life about their matter. Either in wars begone at their setting on, either
in ceasing scismes or division that has been among the clergy who should be
pope, or striving of bishops who should be greatest / as between the bishop
of York and Caunterbury in Ingland and between the bisshops of Ingla^de and
Wales, whereof al ye chronycles be full, or in reforming friars or monks, or in
sleing them that uttered their false hypocrisy with gods word.

When the Emperor was down, and no man in christendom of any power to be
feared, then every nation fell upon others and all lands were at variaunce
between them selves. And then as the Danes came into Ingland and vexed the
Inglishmen, and dwelt there in spyte of their hearts / even so came strange
nations whose names were scace heard of before in these quarters (as the
Uandales / Hunnes and Goths) and ran thorowout all christe^do^ by.C. thousands
together, Uandales* Hunnes^ Goths.
and subdued ye lands and dwelt therein maugre the inhabitours, as thou may
se in Douchlond how diverse nations are enclosed in ye mids of ye land of a
strange tongue which no douchman understands: and that rule continued
well.viij. or ix. score or.ij. hundred years. And in all this ceason / who
soever wan the maystrye / him, the spiritualtye received, and him they crouned
king and to him they cleave. And what so ever any tyrau^t had robbed al his
life, that or most part thereof must he deal among them at his death / for
fear of purgatory. The spirytualty all that ceaso^ preached the pope myghtely,
bylt abbayes for recreatyon and quietness / shryninge them always for saints
which purchased the^ privileges / or fought for their liberties, or disputed
for the popes power, how so ever they lived (but after.L. year when their lives
were forgotten) and if any resisted them what soever mischeuen they went about,
him they noted in chronycles as a cruel tiraunt: ye and what soed misfortune
chaunsed any of his posterity after him, that they noted also, as thouh God
had plaged the^, because their forefather was disobedient unto holy church ^
and ever put the stories that uttered there wickedness out of the way and
gathered relyques from whence they could g^t them, and feigned miracles, yt and
gave the^ selves only unto poetrye / and shut up the scriptur / so y^ this was
the very time of wc Christ speaks. Mat. xxiiij in which false prophete^
should arise and show miracles and wonders to deceive the very elect if yt had
been possible.

FYnallye in this busye woorlde the Kings of Lombardy gatte a little might /
and came up again and were diverse times Emperors / th^gh of no great
might. beringarius.
And one Beringarius ki^ge of Lombardye began to meddle with our holy fathers
business. Wherefore the pope fled unto Ottho King of the saxons, wc by that
time had gotten myg^t, and brought him into Italy against Beringariu^, which
Ottho ouercam Beringarium and was made Emperor for his labor, Ottho.
and thus came the Empire first unto deue^ ^^nde.

And Ottho recaued the empire of one pope John (^ay they) with this oath, pope
Iho^ the xij*
I Ottho do promise and swear unto the lord John^, by the father / the son
and the holy ghooste, and by this wod of the cross that makes living, and by
these relyques of saints, that if I come to Rome with gods help, I will
exalte the holy church of Rome and the, ye gouernoure of the same, unto my
power: Neither shall thou lose life nor members, or that honor that thou have
by my will, counsel, consent or setting a work. Moreover I will make in rome
no co^stitucion or ordinance of any thing that perteyneth unto the or unto ye
Romans without thy counsel. And whatsoever of the lands of saint Peter
comes unto our hands / I will dilyuer it the And unto whom soever I shall
commit the rule of Italy / I will make hi^ swear that he shall help the, to
defend the lands of saint Peter unto his power.

Pope Gregory ye.v.
And Gregory the.v. (when they had got at the last that which they long gaped
for) made this ordinance of choosing the emperor / to stablysh it with all:
that vi. lords of Almany.iij of the spiritualtye and.iij. of the temporaltye
with the king of Bohe^ the seventh to be the odd man and vmpear, should chose
him for ever, and send hi^ to ye pope to receive his oath, and to be crouned.
Nevertheless the pope to keep the Emperor a far of, sends him his
coronacion home to him oftimes much leauer than that he should come any nere as
a meke spirited man, that had lever live solytary and alone, then have his
holiness seen.

A propre similytude to describe our holy father.
And to see how our holy father ca^ up mark the ensample of an yuirtre: first
it springs out of ye earth and then a while crepeth a long by the ground
till it find a great tree: then it joins it self byneath a low unto the
body of ye tree, and crepeth up a little and a little fair and softely. And at
the begi^ning while it is yet thyn and small that the burden is not perceived,
it seems glorious to garnysh the tree in the winter and to bear of the
te^pestes of the wether. But in the mean ceaso^ it thrusts his roots into
the bark of ye tree to hold fast withal / and ceasseth not to ^^ym up till
it be at the top / and above all. And then it sends his branches along by
the branches of the tree, and oue^ grows all and waxes great, heuye and
thyck and sucketh ye moystoure so sore out of the tree and his branches, that
it choketh and st^fleth them. And then the foul styncking yuye waxes mighty
in the sco^pe of the tree and becomes a seat and a nest for all unclean,
bird^s and for b^inde oules which hawk in the dark and dare not come at ye
light.

Even so the bishop of Rome now called POPE, at the b^gining crope a long
upon the earth, and every man trod upon him in this world. But as soon as
there came a christen Emperor, he joined him self unto his fete and kyssed
them, and crope up a little with begging now this privilege, now that, now this
city now that / to find poor people with all and the necessary ministers of
Gods word. the chosi^g^ of the pope and al bisshopes p^rtayned unto ye e^pe^our
and kings once.
And he entitled the Emperor with chosyng the pope and other bisshopes / and
promoted in ye spiritualte, not whom virtue and learning but whom the favor of
great men commended, to flatter to get friends and defenders with all.

the alms
And the alms of the congregacyon which was the fode and patrimony of the
poor and necessary preachers, given unto ye poor is become. S peter's
patrymonye.
that he called saint Peter's patrimony, saint Peter's rentes, saint Peter's
lands, saint Peter's right; to cast a vain fear and an hethenish
supersticiousnes into ye hearts of me^, that no man should dare meadle with what
soever came once into their hands, for fear of saint Peter, though they
ministered it never so euel: and that they which should think it no^e alms to
give the^ any more (because they had to much already) should yet give saint
Peter somewhat (as N^buchodonesser gave his God B^ell) to purchesse an advocate
and an intercessor of saint Peter, Danielis xiiij.
and that saint Peter should at ye first knock, let them in.

And thus with flateringe and fayning and vain superst^cion under the Name of
Saint Peter, he crept up and fastened his roots in the heart of the Emperor,
and with his sword clame up above all his fellow bishops and brought them vnd
his fete. And as he subdued them with the Emperors swerd, even so by subtilty
and help of them (after that they were sworn faithful) he clam above the
Emperor / and subdued him also and made him s^oupe unto his fete / and kiss
them an other while. Yea Pope Calestinus crouned the Emperor Henrye the fifth,
holding the crown between his fete. And when he had put ye crown on / he
smote it of with his fete again, saying: that he had might to make Emperors and
to put them do^ne again.

And he made a constitucion that no lay man should meddle wc their matters, nor
be in their counsels or wit what they did, and that the Pope only should call
the counsel / and the Emperor should but defend the Pope: provided always
that the counsel should be in one of the Popes towns, and where the popes
power was greater then the Emperors: then under a pretense of co^dempnyng some
heresye / he called a general counsel / where he made one a patriarcke, an
other Cardinal / an other Legate, an other Primate* an other Archbysshop / an
other Bishop, an other Deane, an other Archdeacon and so forth, as we now
see.

And as the Pope played with the Emperor / so did his branches and his
me^bres the bisshops play in every kingdom duckedom and lordshyp, in so much
that ye very heirs of them, Qualis pater talis filius. Good natural chylderen.
by whom they came up / hold now their lands of them and take them for their
chief lords. And as the Emperor is sworn to the pope, even so every king is
sworn to the bisshopes and prelates of the realm: and they are the chefest in
all perliamentes: yea they and their money and they that be sworn to them and
come up by them / rule all together.

And thus the pope the father of all hypocrites has with falshod and gyle
perverted the order of the world and turned the roots of the trees upward
and has put down ye kingdom of christ, the popysh order compared with Christ's*
and set up ye ki^gdome of the deuell whose vycar he is, and has put down the
ministers of christ, and has set up the ministers of Satan, disgised yet in
names and garments like unto ye angels of light / and ministres of
righteousness. For Chrstes kingdom is not of the world Ihon. xviij. and the
Popes kingdom is all the world.

And Christ is nether judge nor diuyder in this world Luke.xij^ But the pope
judges and deuideth all the world and takes the empire and al kingdoms and
gives the^ ^o whom he lusts.

Christ says Math. v. Blessed are the pore in spyrite: so that the first
step in ye kingdom of Christ is humblenes or hum^^ytie that thou can find
in thine heart to do service unto all me^, and to suffer that al men tread the.

The Pope says. Blessed be the proud and hyghminded that can clym and subdue
all under them and mainteyne their right and such as will suffer of no man / so
yt he which was yesterday taken from the donghyll and promoted this day by his
prince, shall to morrow for the popes pleasure cu^se him and excommunicate him,
and interdyte his royalme.

Christ says. Blessed be the meke or soft that be harmless as doves.

The pope blesses them that can set all the world together by the ears and
fight and slay manfully for his sake, that he may com h^te from bloudsh^ading
to a bysshopry^e as our Cardinal did, and as Saint Thomas of Canterbury did /
which was made bishop in ye feld, in complete harness on his horseback and
his spear bloody in his hand.

Christ has nether holes for foxes, nor (...) for byrds, nor yet whereon to lay
his head, nor promised ought in this woorlde unto his dyscyples nor took any to
his d^sciple but him that had forsaken all.

The yuytre the Pope has under his roots throughou^ all chrystendome in every
vi^lage holes for foxes, and nestes for unclean birds in all his branches,
and promyseth unto his discyples all the promocyons of the world.

The nerer unto Christ a man comes, the lower he must d^scende and the Poorer
he must wax: but the nerer unto the pope ye come the higher ye must clim and
the more riches ye must gather whence soever ye ca^ get them, to pay for your
bulls, and to purchase a glorious name and license to wear a mytre and a
cross and a pale and goodlye ornaments.

How the pope receaueth his kingdom of the deuell / and how he distributeth
i^ again.
Shortly the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them (which Christ
refused) Matthew. iiij. did the deuell profer unto the pope, and he immediatlye
fell from Christ and worshypped the deuell / and received them. For by falshed
(as he maynteyneth them) came he thereto / and by falshead do al his disciples
come thereto. Who of an hundred one is Pope bis^hope or any great prelate, but
either by necroma^cye or symony or waiting on great men's pleasures / and with
corruptynge of gods word and fasshyonyng it after their lusts.

And the Pope after he had received the kingdom of the world of the deuell
and was become the Deuels vicar, The pope distributeth his fathers kingdom.
took up in like manner all chrystendom an hye, and brought them from the
mekenes of Christ unto the hye hill of the pride of Lucifer and showed them all
the Kingdom of ye earth, saying: fall down and worship me, and I will give
you these. Unto the spiritualtye he says: fall from Christ and preach me,
and take thou that cardenalshippe, thou ye bysshoprycke, thou y^ Abbotshyppe,
and so fourth: thou as many benefyces as thou wylt, and a dispensacio^ for what
thou wylt. And to monks and friars in like manner, take thou that hole, and
thou that nest / with what pryuylege ye will desire and dispensacyons of your
rules, if ye will preach me.

And unto the temporaltie he says: First to the Emperor, if thou wylt fall
down and kiss my feate and swear to hold of me and to defend me, I geuethe
the empire.

And to al kin^^^ in like manner, if they will swear to defend his lyberties and
to hold of him / he crowns them. And even so all temporal Lords from the
highest unto the lowest, and all officers, and all manner subjects, if they
will enjoy lands, rentes, offices, goods and their very lives they must
run the same way.

The very whores (gods honor unregarded) as long as they dispyte not him and
his ordinances, they shall have nes^es in his rentes, and among his Prelates.
And the thieves and murderers shall have dens in his sanctuaries, whatsoever
they do against God / so long as they ha^g on him.

The Apostles chose pryestes to preach Christ only / all other things laid

The apostles chose deacons to ministre the alms of the rych unto the poor.
And to help the deacons they chose widows of.ix. year old, the popysh wi^dows.

wedowes makes who soever comes / whether she be yo^g or old, but none save
them yt be rich and able to pay.xx.xxx. or.xl. pound for their prof^ssio^, to
whom for as much more he will give a dispensacion on the morrow to mary again.
And in stead of such deacons, ^he popysh deacons.

flock.

And the alms that was given to the sustencacion of the poor which thou
shall read in storie^ that it was in some cities above.xx.xxx.xl. yea an
hundred thousand pound, How the pope diuydeth the poor people.
and all the lands given for the same purpose, they have s^olen from them and
have diuyded it among them selves. And there with did they at the beginning
corrupt the great men of the woorlde and clam up to this height were they now
be. And for yt have they strouen among them selves this viij. hundred years.
And to mainteyne yt which they have falsely gotten / has the pope sturred up
aswerde of war in all christendom this.viij. hundred years and has taken
peace clean out of the world.

When the bisshoppes, preastes and deacons were fallen and had received of the
pope the kingdom that parteyned unto the poor people, and had robbed them and
parted their patrimony among them selves / then sprange the orders of monks:
Whose professyon was to abstain from flesh all their lives, to were vile
rayme^t, to eat but once in the day / and that but butter, chese, eggs,
fruits, roots and such things that wear not costly / and might every where
be found. And they wrote books / and wrought diverse things to get their
lyuinge with all. When the lay men saw that the preastes were fallen in to
such couetuousnes / and that the Monks were so holy: they thought, these be
mete men to minister our alms unto the pore people. For their profession is
so holy that they can not deceau^ us as the preastes do, and made the monks
tutors and ministers unto the pore, and gave great Lands and richesse in to
their hands to deal it unto the poor. When the monks saw such abundance
/ they fell after the ensample of the preastes, and took dispe^sacyo^s of the
pope for their rules and strait profession, which now is as wide as their
coules / and divided all among them* and robbed the poor once moare. And out
of the abbayes took he the most part of his Bysshoprickes and cathedral
churches, and the most part of all the lands he has / besides that there
Remain yet so Many mighty abbayes and nun ryes ther^^.

As soon as the monks were fallen, the^ sprang these beggynge fryres out of
Hell / the last kind of kater pillars, Beggyng^ friars.
in a more vile apparel and a more strate relygion that (if ought of relefe
were left among the lay men for the poor people) these horseleches might
suck that also. Which dranebees as soon as they had learned their craft and
had bylt them goodly and costly n^stes / and their lymiters had divided all
contrees among them, to beg in / and had prepared lyuynges of a certayntie /
though wc beggynge / then they also took dispe^sacyons of the pope for to live
as largely and as lewdelye as the monks.

And yet unto the lay men whom they have thus falselye robbed and from which
they have divided them selves and made them a several kingdom among them
selves, The charge of ye lay people.
they leave the payenge of toll / custom and trybute (for unto all the

ways and brydeges the building and recreacyons of their abbayes and
cathedral churches, chapel^ coleges / for which they send out their pardons
daily by heaps / and gather a thousand pound for every hundred that they

If the lay people have war or what soever charge it be, they will not bear
a myte. If the war be theirs (as the one part almost of all war is to
defend them) they will with falshed make the^ bear the greatest part, besides
that, they must leave their wives and children and go fight for them and loose
their lives. And likewise i^ al their charges they have a cast to poll the lay
people. The Scotts cast down a castle of ye bishop of dirams on ye scottysh
bancke called Noram castle. And he gat a pardon from Rome for the building of
it again / wherewith I dout not, bu^ he gat for every pennye that he bestowed
three.

How the spyritualtie bestow their treasure,
And what do they with their store that they have in so great plenty every
where: so that the very beggyng friars in short space to make a cardinal or a
pope of their sect or to do what feate it were for their proffytt, would not
stycke to bring above a Kings rau^so^* Uerely make goodly places and parkes of

peryshe for neade, and faulle in to great in con^enyences might be somewhat
helped and releued, And lay up in stoare to have always to pay for the
defe^di^g of their faith and for to oppress the truth.

How the pope made him ^ law, and why.
AFter that the pope with tyranny was clom up above his brethren and had
made all the Spyrytualtie his subjects and had made of them and him a several
kingdom among them selves, and had separated them from the lay in all things
/ and had got pryuileges that what so ever they did, no man should meddle with
them: and after also he had received the kyngdoms of the earth of Satan and
was become his vicare to dystrybut them, and after that the Emperor was
fallen in like manner at his fete and had worshypped him as God, to receive his
empire of him, and all kings had done like wise to be anointed of him and to be
crouned of him, and after that the world both great and small had submitted
them selves to receive the beasts bag: then because that christ's doctrine
was contrary unto all such kingdoms, and therefore had no law there in how to
rule it he went, and made him a seuerell law of his own making, which passed
in cruelty and tyranny, the laws of all hethen priests.

And in his law he thrust in feigned gifts of old emperors, that were out of
memory, What subtilt^ the pope uses to stablysh his kingdom.
saying that the emperor Constantinus had given up the empire of Rome unto. S.
Syluester, which is proved a false lie for diverse causes: one that saint
siluester being so holy a man as he was / would not have received it contrary
to his masters commandments and doctrine: an other that the emperors
raygned in Rome many years after and all bisshopes sued unto the emperor and
not to the pope, which was but bisshope of Rome only / and not called father of
fathers. Moreover y^ no autentyke story makes mention that any emperor gave
them their patrimonye / but that Pipine which falsely and with strength invaded
the empire gave it unto him. The^ put hem the grant of Phocas / then the gift
of pipine confirmed by the great charles: then a feigned relefe of the election
of ye pope / given up again unto pope Paschale by the emperor Jews. For they
the^ selves had granted unto charlemayne, and his successors for ever the
eleccion or denominacion of the pope and bisshopes to flatter him with all, and
to make him a faithful defender, and that in a general Counsel which (as
they say) can not err. Nevertheless pope Paschal though he believed the
counsel could not err, yet he thought the^ somewhat ouersene, to make so long
a grant, and therefore he purchased a relefe of gentle ^ewes as they pretend
But verily it is more lykely that they feigned that grant to excuse their
tyranny after they had taken ye election into their hands again with violence
/ when the emperors were weak and not able to resyst the^* as they feigned ye
gift of Co^sta^tine, after they had invaded the empire with subtylty and
falshed. And last of al they broughe in the Oath of Ottho with ye order that now
is used to chose ye e^perour

How the pope corrupts the scripture and why.
Moreover lest these his lies should be spyed and least happly the emperors
following / might say, our predecessors had no power to bind us, nor to
minish our might: And least kings following, should say after the same manner /
that the swerd and full power to punish euel doers indifferently is given of
God to every king for his time, and therefore yt their ^ decessour could not
bind them contrary unto the ordinance of God: but rather ye it was unto
their da^pnation to make such grau^tes / and yt they did not execute their
office. And therefore ye foul and mysshape^ mo^stre, gate him to the scripture
and corrupted it with false exposytions / to prove y^ such authority was
given him of God / and calenged it by ye authority of Peter* saying / that
peter was the head of Christ's church and that Christ had made him lord over
the apostles his fellows, in yt he bad hi^ fe^de his sheep and la^bes John y^
last / as who should say ye paul which came long after, was not commanded to
feade as specially as peter, which yet would take no authority over the bodies
or over ye faythes of them which he fed, but was their servant for Christ's
sake, Christ ever the lord and head. And as though ye other apostles were not
likewise as specially commanded as Peter: And as though we now and all that
here after shall love christ, were not commanded to ^eade chrysts flock,
every man in his measure, as well as Peter. Are not we commanded to love our
neighbors as our selves, as well as Peter? Why then are we not commanded to
care for his flock as well as Peter?

Moreover if to feade Christ's sheep is to be greatest (as no doubt to feade
christ's flock is to be great and most to feade* is to be greatest (in wc
office though peter was great, yet paul was greater) how comes that the
pope by that aucthorytie chalengeth to be greatest, and yet this.viij. hundred
years feadeth not at al: but poysoneth their pasture with the venamous leven of
his tradicions and with wrestynge the text unto a contrary sense?

Then came he to this text Mat. xvi Thou art peter and upon this rock I
will byld my congregation or church. Loo says Antichryst the carnal beast /
peter is the rock whereon the church of Christ is bylt, and I am his
successoure, and therefore the head of christ's church. When christ meant by the
rock, the confession that Peter had confessed, saying: Thou art christ the
son of the living god, which art come into this world. This faith is the
rock, Faith is ye root whero^ Chrysts church is bylte.
whereon christ's church is bilt. For who is of christ's church, but he only that
believes that Christ is Gods son, come into to this world to save si^ners?
This faith is it, against wc hell gates can not prevayle. This faith is it,
which saves the congregation of christ and not Peter.

Then he goes forth unto that which follows: Unto the I will give the keys of
the kingdom of heaven / and what soever thou bindest in earth, it shall be bound
in heaven* etc. Lo^, says he, in yt he says what soever thou biodest in earth,
he excepteth nothi^ge, therefore I may make laws and bi^d both king and
emperor. When christ / as he had no worldly ki^gdom, eue^ so he spoke of no
worldly binding, but of binding of sinners. The keys
Christ gave his disciples the keye of the knowledge of the law of God, to bind
all sinners / and the keye of the promyses to louse all that repent and to let
them into the mercy that is made up for us in christ.

Then comes he unto an other text which Christ rehearses Mathe. la^^,
saying: Al power is given men in heaven and earth* go ye therefore, and teach al
nations, b^ prysyng them in the name of the father, and ye sonn^, and of the
holy ghost, teachinge them to keep all that I commanded you: And behold I am
with you unto the worlds end: Loo says the pope, Christ has all power in
heaven and earth, without excepcyon, and I am christ's vicar, wherefore all
power is mine / and I am above all kings and Emperors in temporal
iurisdictyo^ and they but my servants to kiss on^ my fete only but my. N.
also if I list not to have the^ stoop so low. When christ as I said because he
had no temporal kingdom, Christ's power is to save si^ners
even so he meant of no te^porall power, but of power to save sins / which
they profess of, the text declares by that he says, goo ye therefore, and
teach and baptyse: that is preach this power to all nations / and wash of their
si^nes through faith in the promises made in my blood. o^ this man^r ^^^lech
he with textes.


Then he comes unto an other text Hebre. vij. which is. The presthode b^ing
translated, the law must needs be translated also. Now says the pope, the
priesthode is translated unto me, wherefore it perteyneth unto me to make laws
and to bind every man. And the pistle means no such thing / but proves to
euydently yt the ceremo^i^s of Moises must cease. For the prye^^es of the old
testament must needs have been of the tribe of Leui as Aaron was* whose duty
for ever was the offering of sacrifices. Wherefore when that priesthode ceased,
the sacrifices and ceremonies ceased also. Now that priesthode ceased in
Christ, which was a priest of the order of Melchiscde^ and not of the order of
Aaron^ for the^ he must have been of the tribe of Judah and of the sede of
David. Wherefore they that are under Christ's priesthod are under no sacrifices
or ceremonies. And of this manner iugle they with all the scriptur, which
falshed lest the lay men should perceive with readinge the process of the Text
/ is all their fear what soever they pretend.

Moreover y^ thou may perceive the popes falshed, mark: Christ said unto
p^ter, I will give and not I give, nether said he I will give unto the only:
Therefore ^oke in the.xx. chaptre of Iho^ where he gave them the keys after his
resurrection / and thou shall se that he gave them unto all indyfferentlye
sayeinge: Christ gave all his Apostles like aucthor^tye.
As my father sent me so send I you. Whether sent he them? in to all the
world / and unto all nations. What to do? to preach ye law that ye people
might repent, and the promyses yt they might believe in Christ for ye remyssyon
of sins* saying: receive the holy ghost, who so euers sin ye forgive, they
shall be forgeuen* by which holy ghost he gave them understanding of the
scripture and of all that they should preach: as thou may see Luk last,
where he opened their wits to understand the scripture and said, that
repentance and forgeuenes of sins must be preached in his name to all
Natyons, and that they were witnesses to preach it. Whereby thou seyste yt to
Bynd and to Loose is but to preach and tell the people their fautes, To bind
and louse is to preach.
and to preach mercy in christ to all that repent.

And when he says / all power is given me: he says not go thou Peter and
preach but says unto all indifferentlye / go ye and preach this power given
me of my father ^o save all that repent, and to dampne them that repent not but
follow ye lusts of their flesh, with full desire to live beastly being
ennymyes unto the law of god.

And Math. xviij. Peter axed christ how often he should for give his brother /
whether seven times. Nota.
And christ said / seuentye times seven times. As who should say / as often as
he repents and axeth forgiveness.

Now though this were spoken unto Peter only, because Peter only moved the
question / yet it apertayneth not unto us all as well as unto Peter? Are not we
as much bound to forgive our neighbors that repent and axe forgeuenes, as
Peter* Yes verelye. But because Peter only axed ye question, therefore did
Christ teach us by Peter. If an other had axed / he would have taught us by
that other. And in like manner when christ axed who say ye that I am: if any
other of the Apostles which believed it as well as Peter, had said as Peter
did, thou art christ, the sone of the lyuinge go^ / which art come in to the
world of sinners, to save them: unto him would Christ have answered / as he did
to Peter / that upon the rock of that his confession he would have bylt his
church, and would have Promised him keys as well as he did Peter. Yea and in
the.xviij. chapter of Matthew, Christ says to all the Apostles / yea / and to
all congregatyons where sinners be, A woman has power to bind.
that what soever they bound should be bound and what soever they loosed
should be loosed.

Moreover every man and woman that know Christ and his doctrine, have the
keys and power to bind and loose: in an order yet and in their measure, as
time place and occasion gives and pryuatelye. May not a wife, if her husband
sin against God and her, and take a another woman / tell him his taute
between him and her secretelye, and in good manner humblye, and bynd his
concyence with the law of god? And if he repent may she not for give him and
loose him as well as the Pope? Yea, and better to, as long as the sin is
secret, in as much as he sin the specially against hy^* and not against the
pope.

And so may the son do to the father / and a servant to the master / and
every man to his neighbor, as thou seyst in y^ said.xviij. chaptre of
Matthew. How be it to bind and loose in the concience by open preaching
perteyneth unto the officers that are appointed thereto. And to bind and loose
open Sinners, and them that will not repent till they be complained on unto the
congregation, perteyneth unto the congregation.

Finally there were many that preached christ at Rome, R^^so^s ye peter was not
ye greatest by any authority given hi^ of Christ.
yet Peter came thither if he came ever thither: as Paul and many other. Had
they not authority to bynd and loose? Or else how did they convert the people?
Peter was also an Apostle and went from place to place as Paul did, and as
Paul ordained Bysshopes in every place to teach the people, so no doubt did
Peter. Why then might not those Bysshopes calenge authority by Peter as well
as they of Rome? they say also in their own lege^des that Peter had his seat
ot Antioch first. Did he run to Rome living no man behind him to teach the
people at Antioch? God forbid. Why then might not that Bishop calenge Peter's
authority? They will happily say sooner then prove it, that Peter dyed at Rome,
and therefore his authority is greatest there. Then by that rule christ's power
is no where so full as at Jerusalem. But what has Christ's invisible kingdom
to do with places: Where Christ's Gospel is, Chryst^^ power is in the gospel
their is his power full and all his auctroite as well i^ one place as in an
other.

Fynallye to get authority whence so ever, they can snatch it, they join
Paul with Peter in their own laws Distinctio. xxij saying: By the auctorytie
of peter and Paul. Which is clean against the^ selves. paull is called to help
For they say in their own law in the presence of the superior, the power of
the inferior cease, and is none at all. Now if Peter be greater then Paul,
then by that rule / where Peter is present their Paul is but a subject and
without auctorytie: As where Christ is present bodil^e and preaches hi^
self, there ye apostles give up their auctorytie / and hold their peace and
sit down at his fete, and become scolers and harken to.

Wherefore in that they join Paul with Peter, and challenge their superiority
as well by ye authority of Paul as of Peter, there they make Paul fellow and
equal with peter. And thus it is false that Peter was ^eater then his
fellows, but the blind onles care not what they houle, seeing it is night and
the day light of gods word, shut up that no man can spy them.

Moreover with this term Peter's seat they iugle a pase (as with infinite other)
saying that Peter's seat, is the chief seat / but what Peter's seat is that they
tell you not For wyste ye that / ye should some perceive that they lie. Peter's
seat is no stole or chair (for what has the kingdom of Christ to do with such
baggage) but, it is a spiritual thing. Christ says in the gospel Math. xxiij.
The Scrybes and pharyzees sit on Moses seat. What was moses seat there, a
chair ^or the temple / or the churchs, or synagoge of the land? Nay verily*
for moses came never there. But Moses seat was Moses law and doctrine. Eue^
so peter's seat, is peter's doctrine, ye gospel of christ wc peter taught. And
the same doctrine is Peter's keys: so that peter's seat, Peter's keys and
Peter's doctrine is all one thing Now is peter's doctrine, Paul's doctrine and
the doctrine of all the.xij. Apostles in differently, for they taught all one
thing. Wherefore it follows / that peter's keys, and peter's seat, be the
keys and seat of Paul also, and of all the other.xij. Apostles and are
nothing save the gospel of Christ And thus as Peter's doctrine is no better
then Paul's but one thing, even so Peter's seat is no greter nor hier or holyer
then y^ sete of ye other.xij. Peter's sete now is christ's sete / Christ's
gospel on which all the appostles sat and on which this day sits all they
only that preach christ truly Uherfore as Antichrist preaches not peter's
doctrine (which is christ's gospel) so he sytteth not on peter's sete / but on
the sete of satan whose vicar he is and on the sete of his own laws and
ceremonies and false doctrine where unto he compels all men with vyolence of
sword.

Then he clame to purgatory with the ladder of the said text, Purgatori
what so ever thou bindest in earth. etc. purgatory says he, is in earth:
wherefore I am lord there to. Nevertheless as he can prove no purgatory / so
can he not prove that if there were any / it should be in the earth. It might
well be i^ ye eleme^te or sphere of fire under ye moan as well as in the earth.
But to bynd and loose, is as I have above said / to preach and to feed and
with Christ's doctrine to purge souls. And they that be dead be not of the
flock which christ bad Peter feed, but they that live only.

Then clam he up with the same ladder still over all vows and professions of
all relygious parsones, Uowes. Oaths. testame^ts.
and over oaths made between man and man to dispense with them / and over all
men's testamentes to alter the^. For what thou make an hospytall, that will
he shortly make a college of preastes, or a place of relygyon, or what he
lusts. The^ all manner monks and friars and like d^affe took dyspensations of
him for the ordenau^ces of their old founders

And because, as they thought, they had prayed and distributed for their Souls
Enough to bring the^ out of purgatory, they thrust the^ out of their beedrolles
and took daily mo and mo.

But ever sens they took dyspensations of the pope both for their rules and to
divide all among them, they receued in the name, not of the poor / but of
purgatory, to quench the ragi^ge fire there of / which is as hot as their
belyes can feign it, and foles be out of their wyts to believe it: promys^ge a
mass daily for.xl. shilyngs by the year / of which fou^dations when they have
gotten twenty, Union.
they will yet with an union purchased of the pope, make but one chau^trie. For
if they should do all that they have promised from the first founder unto thi^
day.v. hunderth monks were not enough in many cloisters.

Thynkest thou ye me^ were ever so mad to make the fassions that are now among
them? to give the sell^rar such a so^me, and ye priour and the suppriour and
the other officers so much for their parts as they have yerelye, and to
^^empte the Abbot from his brethren and to send him out of the abbaie into
such parkes and places of pleasure, and give him a thousand, fyftene hundred,
two thousand or.iij thousand pound yearly to sport himself with all? Nay,
but when through hypochrisie they had gotten la^d enough then they turned unto
the pope and took dyspensacions both for their rules which were to hard for
such aboundau^ce, and for ye wylles of their fou^ders, and served a great sort
of founders under one per dominum, and divided among few that which was enough
for a great multitude.

It was the pope that devised all these fassions to corrupt the prelates with
abu^daunce of worldelye pleasures, of which he wist that ye worst would be most
gready and for which he wist also y^ he should find Iudasses ynow that would
forsake Christ and betraye the truth, and be sworn false unto him and his
godhead. He makes of many chauntries one, of an abbay, a cathedral church, and
out of the abbays plucketh he the Bysshoprykes. And as Bysshoppes pay for
their bulls, even so do an infinyte number of abbots in chrystendom, in all
lands some* which Abbots be bishops within them selves and immediately under
the pope. And other abbots and prioures se^d after the same ensample daily unto
rome to purchesse license, to wear a mitre and a cross and gaye orname^tes,
to be as glorious as the best. etc. And where before God, no man is a priest,
but he yt is appointed to preach Christ's gospel unto the people, and the
people ought not to give ought unto ye spiritualtye / but for the maintenance
of the preaching of Gods word, the Pope takes vi. or.vij. yea ten.xx. and as
many benefices as he lysteth, and gives them unto one ye preaches not at all
as he does all other dygnities of the spirituality: he that will purchasse and
pay / and be sworn, shall have what he will.

How they prove all their general counsels.
WHen the Bysshoppes and Abbottes and other great Prelates had forsaken
Christ and his lyuinge, and were fallen down before the beast the vycar of
Satan, to receive their kingdom of him / then the pope called together
diverse counsels of such holy apostles, and there concluded and made of every
opinion that seemed proffitable / an article of ye faith. If thou axe where is
the scriptur to prove it? They answer we be the church and can not err, and
therefore say they, The church ca^ not err.
what we conclude, though there be no scripture to prove it / it is as true as
the scriptur and of egall authority with the scripture and must be believed as
well as the scryptur under pain of dampnation. For (say they) our truth
depends not of the truth of the scriptur that is, we be not true in our
doing because the Scripture testifyeth unto us that we do truly: but contrary
/ the truth of the scripture (say they) depends of us, that is, the
scripture is true because that we admyt it and tell the that it is true* For
how could thou know that it were the scripture except we told ye so? and
therefore we need no witness of the scripture for that we do, it is enough that
we so say of our own head for we can not erre^

Which reason is like as though young monks newly professed, A similitude.
should com by the rules of their order and ordinances of their old founders
and would go about to keep them: and the old cankered monks should call them
back unto the corrupt and false manner that now is used, sayi^g: ye er. Do only
as we teach you / for your profession is to obey your Elders. According unto
the rules of our order and ordinances of our founder shall they say: We can
teach you none other, shall the old monks say / nor ca^ ly unto you, ye ought
therefore to believe us and to do as we bid you. The young monks shall answer,
we se that you ly, clean contrary unto all that is written in our rules and
ordinances. The old monks shall say ye can not understand them except we
expound them unto you / another yet know y^ they be your rules / except that
ye believe y^ we can not lie unto you. For how can ye know that these be your
rules and ordynau^ces / but as we your elders tell you so? Now when we tell you
that these be your rules and ordinances how can ye be sure undoubtedly that
it is so / except ye believe undoubtedly that we can not lie? Wherefore if ye
wylbe sure yt they be your rules and ordenaunces / then ye must first believe
that we can not lie. Leave such imaginations and disputations therefore and lay
your rules and ordinances out of your hands and look no more on the^, for
they make you err And come and do as we tell you / and captiuate your wits
and believe that we can not lyr unto you, and that ye can not understand your
rules and ordynaunces. Even so if thou say it is contrary to the scripture:
they a^swere yt thou vnderstandeste it not / and that thou must captive thy
wit and believe that though it seame never so contrary, yet it is not
contrary: no if they determe yt christ is not risen again and though ye
scripture testyfy y^ he is risen again / yet (say they) they be not contrary,
if they be wisely understand. Thou must believe / say they, y^ there is some
other meaning in the scripture and y^ no man understands it: but y^ we say /
whether without scripture or against it / that must thou believe that it is true.

And thus because yt the scripture would not agree with them / they thrust it
out of ye way first, and shut up the kingdom of heaven which is Christ's
gospel, with false^^^ posicyons and with such sophistry and with false
principles of natural wisdom. And the abottes took the scripture from their
monks lest some should ever bark against ye abottes living, the abottes keep
y^ monks in ignorance, and ye bisshopes ye priests
and set up such long service and syngyng to werye them with all that they
should have no leisure to read in the scripture but with their lips, and made
them good chere to fill their bellyes and to stop their mouths. And the
bishops in like manner to occupy their priests with all, that they should not
study the scripture for barkyng against them, set up long Seruyse wonderovse
intricate / so that in xij. y^ares thou coudest scace learn to turn a right
unto it: Long mate^ses, long Euen^onges, long Masses / long Dyryges with
vauntage yet to mitigate the tediousnes / quia leuis est labor cum lucro / for
lucre (say they) makes the labor light: ever noselyng them in Ceremonies and
in their oune co^stitucyons, decrees, ordinances and laws of holy church.

And the promises and testament which the sacrament of Christ's body and blood
did preach daily unto ye people, that they put out of knowledge and say now
that it is a sacryfyce for the souls of purgatory, yt they might the better
sell their mass. And in the vniuersytes they have ordened that no man shall
look on the scriyture until he be noseled in heathen learning.viij. or nine
year and armed with false principles, the cast of the universities*
with which he is clean shit out of the understanding of the scripture. And at
his first co^mi^g unto the university, he is sworn that he shall not defame
the vniuersytie what soever he sees. And when he takes first degree / he is
sworn that he shall hold none opinion condemned by ye church / but what such
opinions be / yt he shall not know. And they when they be admitted to study
divinity, because the scripture is locked up with such false exposicions and
with false pri^ciples of natural philosofye that they can not enter in, they
go about the out side and dspute all their lives about words and vain
opinyons pertaining as much unto the healyng of a man's hele as health of his
soul. Prouiso
Provided yet always / lest god give his syngular grace unto any parson / that
none may preach except he be admitted of the bisshopes. The^ ca^ Thomas de
aquino and he made the pope a god with his sophystry, Saint thomas de Aquino.
and the pope made him a saynct for his labor, and called him doctor sanctus,
for whose holiness no man may deny what soever he says save i^ certain places
where among so many lies he said now and then true. And in like manner who so
ever defends his tradicions, decrees and privileges, him he made a saint
also for his labor, were his living never so contrary unto the scripture,
Saints.
as Thomas of Canterbury with many other like whose life was like Thomas
cardinals but not Christ's neither is Thomas cardinals life any thing save
cou^trefaytynge of saint Thomas of canterbury. Thomas becket was first seen in
marchau^dise temporal, Thomas of caunterbury.
and then to learn spiritual marchaundyse, he gatt him to Theobald Archbisshop
of Canterburye which sent him diverse times to Rome about business of holy
church. And when Theobald had spied his actiuitie, he shore hi^ deaco^ lest he
should go back, and made him Archdeacon of Canterbury and upon yt, presented
him to the king. And the king made him his chau^celare in which office he
passed the pomp and pride of Thomas cardinal as far as the ones shrine
passes the others tomb in glory and riches. And after that, he was a man of
war, and captayn over.v. or.vi. thousand men in full harness as bright as
sai^ct George and his spear in his hand and encou^tred who soever ca^ against
hi^ / and overthrew the iolyest rutter that was in all the host of France. And
out of the feld hot from blood sheading was he made bishop of Caunterburye
and did put of his helm and put on his mytre / put of his harness and on with
his robes, and laid down his spear and took his cross, yet his hands were
cold / and so came with a lustye corrage of a man of war, to fight an other
while against hi^ prince for the pope. Where his princes causes were with the
law of God, and the popes clean contrary. And the po^pe of his consecratyon
was after his old worldly fation. How be it yet he is made a saint for his
worshyppyng of the holy seat of saint peter / not that seat of peter which
is Christ's gospel / but an other lied to be peter's, and is in deed cathedra
pestilencie / a chayr of false doctrine. And because he could no skyll of our
lords gospel he said of matens with our lady, say they. If any man
understand the laten, let him read his life and compare it unto the scriptur,
and the^ he shall se such holiness, as were here to long to be rehearsed. And
every abbay and every cathedral church did shrine the^ one God or other / and
mingled the lives of ye very saints with stark lies / to move men to offer /
which thing they call devotion.

And though in all their doings they oppress the te^poralty and their come^
wealth, and be grievous unto ye rych, and paynfull to y^ poor: yet they be so
many and so exercised in wyles and so subtyl and so knit and sworn together yt
they compass ye te^poralty and make the^ bear the^ whether they will or will
not (as the euye does the oak) partly with iugglinge, and beside that with
wordly polycy. For every abbot will make him yt may do most in the shyre or with
the king / the stuarde of his lands and, give him a fee yearly, and will le^d
unto some, and feast other, yt by such means they do what they will. And little
master parso^ after the same manner, if he come into an house and the wife be
snoutefaire he will rote him self there by one craft or other: either by vsi^g
such pastime as ye good man does / or in being benefycyall by one way or
other, or he will lend him / and so bring him into his danger, that he can not
thruste him out when he would, but must be compelled to bear him and to let
him be homely whether he will or not.

An ensample of practyse out o^ our own chronycles.
Take an ensample of their practice out of our own stories. King Herolde.
King Herold exiled or banished Robert Archbisshope of Canterburye. For what
cause the Inglysh polychronicon specifieth not. Robert of canterbury.
But if the cause wear not sum what suspect, I think they would not have
Passed it over with scylence. This Robert gat hi^ immediately unto king
Wylliam the conqueroure then duke of Normandye. And the pope Alexander sent
duke Wylliam a baner to go and conquer Ingland and clean remission unto
whosoever would follow the baner and goo with king Wyllyam / here mark how
straight the pope folowed-Christs steps and his apostles: Remission of si^nes
to conquer england.
they preached forgeuenes of sins, to all that repented throw Christ's blood
shedyng: the Pope preaches forgiveness of sins to all that will slay their
brethren bought with Christ's blood: to subdue them unto his tyra^nie. What so
ever other cause duke wylia^ had against king Herold / thou may be sure
that ye pope would not have meddled if Herold had not troubled his kingdom ^^e:
neither should duke willyam have been able to conquer the land at that time
except the spyritualtie had wroughte on his side. What blood did that conquest
cost England / through which almoost all the lords of the Inglysh blood were
slain, and^ the Normandes became rulers / and all the la^es were changed into
French? But what cares ye holy father for sheading of lay men's blood? It
were b^tter that.x. hundred thousand lay knaves lost their lives, then that
holy church should louse one ynch of her honor, or saint Peter's seat one jot
of her right.

Ancelmus
And Ancelmus that was bishop in short time after, never left striuinge with
that myghtie prince king Wyllyam the second / until he had compelled him
maugre his teth, to deliver up the inuestiture or election of bishops unto
saint Peter's vycare / which inuestiture was of old time ye kings duet^e.

And (...) when the said king Wyllyam (...) the tribut that pryestes gave
(...) to their bishops for their whores (...), did not Raffe bishop of Chich^
(...) gods service (as they call it) (...) the church doors with thorns
through out al his di^cese, until the king had yielded him vpp^ his trybute
again? For when the holy father had forbidden pryestes their wives / the
bishop permitted the^ whores of their own for a yearly tribute, and do yet
in all lands, save in Ingland where they may not have any other save men's
wives only.

And again for the election of Steven langton archbysshop of Canterbury, what
miserye and wretchedness was in the royalme a long ceason? The^ was the land
interdited many years. And when that help not, then Irelande rebelled against
king John immedyatly, Note.
and not without ye secret workinge of our Prelates I dare well say. But
finally when neither the interditing nether yt secret subtlety help* and
when Ihon would in no means consent ye saint peter's vicar should raygne alone
over the spiritualtye, and over all yt perteyned unto the^, and yt they should
sin and do all mischefe unpunished / the pope sent remissyo^ of sins to
the king of France for to go and conquer his land. (...)* of sins to
co^quere
Whereof king Iho^ was so sore afraid yt he yielded up his croune unto ye pope,
and swear to hold ye la^d of hi^ and yt his successors should do so likewise.

And again in King Richardes days ye second / Thomas Arundell archbysshop of
Canterbury and chau^celare was exyled with ye Earl of Darbye. Thomas Aru^dell.
The outward pretense of the varyaunce between the King and his lords was
for the delyueraunce of the town of Braste in Brytayne. But our prelates had
an other secret mystery a bruing They could not at their own lust slay the
poor wretches which at that time were converted unto repentance / and to the
true faith / to put their trust in christ's death and bloudsheadyng for the
remission of their sins by the preachinge of Johan Wyclefe / As soon as the
archbysshop was out of the royaume, Practyse.
the Irishmen began to rebel against king Rychard as before against King
Ihon: But not hardelye without the inuisyble inspyration of them that rule
both in the court and also in the consciences of al men. They be one kingdom
sworn together one to help an other scatered abroad in all royalmes.

And how be it that they strive among them selves who shall be greatest, yet
against the temporal power they be always at one though they disse^ble it and
feign as though one held against the other to know their enemies secrets to
betray them with all. They ca^ inspyre priuelye into ye breasts of ye people,
what myschefe they list, and no man shall know whence it comes. Their letters
go secretly from one to an other through out all kyngdo^s. Sai^ct peter's vicar,
shall have word in.xv. or.xvi. days, from the uttermost part of christendom.
The bishops of England at their need / ca^ write unto ye bishops of Ireland,
scotland, denmark, douchland / france and spain, promysi^g them as good a
turn an other time / puttyng them in remembrance that they be all one holy
church / and yt the cause of the one, is the cause of the other, saying: if
our ^ugglyng break out / yours can not be long hyd. And the other shall serve
their turn / and bring the game unto their hands, and no man shall know how
it comes about. As soon as king Richard was gone to Ireland to subdue these
rebellyous, the bysshope came in again, and prevented the king, and took up his
power against him and took him prisoner / and put him down / and to death most
cruelly, and crouned the earl of darby king. O merciful Christ / what blood
has that coronacion cost England? But what care they? Their causes must be
avenged. He is not worthy to be king that will not avenge their quarels^ For
do not the kings receive their kingdom of the beast, and swear to worship
him and maynteine his throne? And then when the earl of Darbye which is king
Henry the fourth / was crouned, the prelates took his sword and his sons
Henry the fifth after him, as all ye kings swerdes syns and abused them to
shed christian blood at their pleasur. And they coupled their cause unto the
kings cause (as now) and made it treason to believe in Christ as ye scriptur
teaches and to resyst the bisshopes (as now) and thruste the^ in the kings
prysons (as now) so that it is no new inue^cion, that they now do but even an
old practyse, though they have done their busy cure to hyde their science / yt
their conueyaunce should not be espied.

And in king henrye the.vj. days, how raged they as fierce lions against good
duke Humfre of Gloceter the kings uncle, and protector of the realm in the
kings youth and childehod, Duke Umfre.
because that for him they might not slay whom they would, and make what
cheuysaunce they lusted. Would not ye bishop of Wynchester have fallen upon
him / and oppressed him openly with might and power, in the City of London,
had not the cityzens come to his help?

But at the last they found the means to contryue a dryft to bring their
matters to pass, and made a parliament far from the cityzens of London, where
was slain the good duke and only wealth of the royalme, and the mighty shylde
that so long before had kept it from sorrow, which shortly after his death,
sell thereon by heaps. But ye cronicles can not tell wherefore he dyed / nor by
what means. No meruell verily. For he had need of other eyes then such as the
world sees with all that should spy out their priuye paths. Nevertheless the
chronicles testifye that he was a virtuous man, a godly and good to the commonwealth. Moreover the Protector of Purgatory says in his Dialoge / quod I, and
quod he / and quod your friend, how that he was a noble man / and a great
clerk, and so wise that he could spy falce miracles and dysclose them, and
Judge them from the true / which is an hateful science unto our spyrytualtye
and moare abhorred them necromancie or wytchcrafte and a thing wherefore a man
by their law, I dare well say, is worthy to dye / and that secretly if it be
possible. Now to be good to the commonwealth / and to se false miracles, and
thirdely to wit^stande that France then brought under the fete of the
Inglyshmen, should not be set up again, by whose power the pope holds down ye
Emperor and reygneth in his stead, becauses why he might dye though by what
means be not known. For to be good to ye comen wealth, is to be hurtefull to
the spiritualtye, three causes
seeing the one is the others pray / as the lamb is the wolves. Secondaryly if
a man be so clear eyed that he can spy false miracles / how can iugglers
get their lyuinge and be in price where such a fellow is? Thyrdlye to keep
down ye ki^gdo^ of france, is to pull. S Peter's vicar out of his seat.

Now if the great baude y^ whore of babylon were destroyed, then would the
bordel and stues of our prelates shortly perish. If Abadon that destroyer king
of ye grassehoppers which devour all that is greane, were destroyed, then were
the kingdom of our caterpyllers at an end.

By what craft the pope keeps the Emperor down.
Mark an other practice of our most holy prelates. When the empire was
translated unto the germaynes / though the emperor was fallen down, and had
kyssed the Popes fete, and was become his sworn servant: yet there was much
strife and open war oftimes between the popes and the emperors. And the
popes have put down many good Emperors / by help of the Bisshopes, wc every
where secretly persuaded ye lords, to forsake the emperou^s / and to take
dispensacio^s of the pope for their oaths.

And contrary wise, the emperors have now and then deposed diverse popes at
request of the Cardinals and other great prelates, by whose help only they
were able to do it. For else verily though al Kings christened / had sworn to
depose one Pope out of his seat, if they had not y^ favor of other prelates
thereto, they might happily by the secret practice of them, to be put out of their
own seats in ye mean time. The pope therefore, to be sure of him self and out
of ye fear and danger of ye emperor, were he never so mighty, and that ye
emperor should not se / his daily open pastimes, made friendship and amytye with
the Uenecian^ on the one side of him, and let them com in to certain cities of
the Emperors in Italy and with the French king on the other side / and late
him also up into certain Cytyes and possessions of the Emperoures: and he
himself in the mids: And shot out the Emperor from coming any more to
Rome, and ever sent him his coronacion home to him. No man rebuk ye pope
And then he made a law that no man should rebuke the Pope for what so ever
myschefe he did, saying, that the Pope was above al / and judge over all, and
none over him, and therefore forbade in his law. Distinctio.xl. Si Papa.
saying: though the pope be proved negligent about him self / and also the
soul health of his brethern, and slack in his work and speachlesse as
concerning any good, and draw with him by his ensample inumerable people to
hell to be punished with him with diverse torments everlastingly: yet se that
no mortal man presume once to rebuke his fautes here. For he shall judge all
men and no man him. O antichryst. Is he not a^tichrist that will not have his
life tried by Gods word?

^enecians.
If the Uenecians catch any of our holy fathers towns or possessions whether by
war or that they have bought it, or that it be laid to morgage unto them or
that ye old Pope has given it with the marriage of some daughter unto the duke
of Uenyce: then the holy father that succedeth, when he sees his ceason,
sends for it again, saying that it is not laufull for lay men to with hold
saint Peter's patrimony. If they allege that they bought it and so forth: his
fatherhod answers that the old Pope had none authority to make any such
cheuisaunce with saint Peter's enheritaunce: he could have but the use of it
his life long / and after it must needs return unto his successoure again.
And upon that he interdyt^th them and curses them as black as coals / and
down to the pyt of hell.

But the Uenecians knowing more of our holy fathers practyse, for their
nyenes then we which dwell a far of / and wyser then we of cold contrees /
perceauing also that their color chau^geth not with his cursynge, and that
they syncke not, and that their meat digesteth as well as before / and that
(as Erasmus says) they s^yte as easyly as before (with reverence of the holy
course I speak it) and therefore fear not his interdiction nor excommunicatyon.

Then our holy father raises up all his power that he is able to make in
Italy, against them / and sends for the zwytzers to come and help. If he be
not yet strong enough / then he sendeh unto the bishops of france, warning
them that if his seat decay / theyrs can not long prosper, and therefore that
they put their king in remembrance how that he is called most christen king
and that they desire him to do somewhat for his tytie against this disobedient
rebellyons, unto the most holy se of Rome our mother holy church.

Frenchmen
If an other time the frenchmen come to nigh our holy father, as they be ever
gaping for Italy, to bring the empire home again to france. Then the most
holy vicare brings his whole power against them with the power of the
venecians, and with his old friends the zwytzers. If he be not yet strong
enough / then he sends to the bisshops of England, Englismen
to help their god, and to move their king to do somewhat for holy church,
puttyng him in remembrance of whom he holds his croune and of his oath, and
how many cappes of mayntenaunce have been ever sent unto his forefathers, and
what honor it was unto them, and that he may easily get as great honor as
they / and happly a more excellent title / if he will take our holy fathers
part, besides that he shall purchase remyssyon of all his sins.

Then must the peace and all the apointementes made between us and france, be
broken, and the king must take a dyspensacion for his oath. For the king of
france will attempt nothing in Italy, until he have sent his ambassadors /
and have made a perpetual peace with our king, the Sacrament of the body of
our savior broke between them, to confyrme the appointement. But I suppose
that the breakyng signifies that the appointeme^t shall not long endure / for
a great deal of flower would not make so many hoostes, The abuse of the
sacrament.
as they call them, or synginge loves, as has been broken in our days
between christen princes (as they wylbe called) to confirm promises that have
not long been kept. Other use of that blessed sacrament will the princes none
know: but christ ordained it to be a perpetual memory yt his body was broken
for our sins upon ye cross, and yt all that repent should receive as often as
they ea^e of it / forgeuenes of their misdeades through faith. If ye ki^gs of ye
earth when they break that sacrament between them, do say on this wise: The
body of our savior (which was broken on ye cross for the sin of al ye
repent and have good hearts and would feign keep his law) be broken unto my
da^nacion, if I break this oath: the^ is it a terrible oath, and they had neade
to take head how they make it. ^d if it be lawfully made, not to break it at
all. But as they care for the ^rothe / which they make in wedlocke^ so they
care for this.

Whatsoever nead the pope has, he will not send to the Emperor to come and
help hi^ in Italy, for fear lest he would take to himself what soever he
conquered of ye frenchmen / and wax to strong and minish our holy fathers
power, and become our holy fathers vicar / as he is saint Peter's. Nevertheless
if we englishmen will hyre the Emperor to com and fight against france for
the right of the church in these quarters that ^e next unto us, his fatherhod
is content to admyt his service.

When our king has granted to take our holy fathers part / then the pretense
and cloak out ward must be, that the king will ^alenge his right in france.
And to aid the king in his right, must the commens be mylked till they blede
again. Then to do the king service, the lords sell or lay their lands to
morgage. Then is clean remission given to sleo french dogs. Remission of
sins.
He that dies in the quarrel shall never see purgatory / but file tor heaven
straight, even with a thought.

WHen the Pope has what he desires in Italye, then must we make peace with
the Frenchmen again immediatlye / that france be not all together trode^
under the fete: but that it rema^ always in a mean state / strong Enough to
match the emperor and to keep him down, but not to mighty for oppressinge
the pope, and then our prelates to bring the peace about / send immediately a
friar forest / or a vicar of croiden / to preach before y^ king and his lords /
which preacher roreth and cries unto the^ as though he hallowed his hounds and
makes exclamations, saying: Alas what will ye do? spare Christen blood: will
ye slay your own souls? Be not the fre^chme^ as well christian as ye?
Moreover ye slay pore innocents that never offended? make peace for ye passion
of christ, kill not one an other as though Christ had not dyed for you: but
fight rather against the turks.

The^ come in the Ambassadors of france, and money a few prelates and
certain other the kings playfellowes / y^ be sworn with them to betraye both
the king and ye royalme too: And then is peace concluded. But outwardelye
there is nothing save a truce taken for half a year / till our soldiers be
at home again / for fear least they would not be content* Then comes the
whole host home beggerd both great and small And the poor that can not suddenly
get work, fall to stealyng and be hanged at home. This could More tell in his
Utopia before he was the cardenalles sworn secretarye, and fallen at his fete
to betraye the truth / for to get promocyon.

Henry ye.v.
Take an ensample: the bishops sent king Henrye the fyft out to conquer
France. The cause was (says the chronicles) that the king went about to take
their temporallyes from them. And therefore to bring the king into an other
imaginacyon, they monyed him, and sent him into france.

When they had sent out the king, he conquered more then was their will and
more then they supposed possible for him in so short space / and brought
france clean under fete: so that our prelates had much secret busynes, to
set it up again, but what is impossyble unto so great Gods?

In king Henryes days the.vi. our holy father of Rome made the bishop of
Wynchester a cardynall, Henry ye.vi
which went shortly after into france to treat of a truce between Ingland and
france. And him met a legate of Rome, a cardinal also: after which meating
/ Inglyshmen had ever the worse in france, and their chefest fryende the duke
of Burgayne forsook them. For when cardinals and bishops mete together, they
have their secret counsel by them selves, wherein they conclude neither what
is good for Inglande, nor yet for france, but what is best for our holy
fathers proffytt to keep him in his state.

When king Henry was of age, there was a marriage made between him and ye earl
of Arminackes daughter in Gia^, with the which should have been given many
castles and towns in Gian and a great so^me of money thereto. But ye marriage
was broken not without the secret workyng of our prelates and dyspensation of
our holy father thou may be sure. And a marriage was made between him and
the kings daughter of Cecyle, for which Ingland gave up the whole dukedom of
Gyan and Earledom of Mayme / whereby we lost all Normandye, whereof they were the
kaye. And beside y^, the co^munes gave a, xv. and an half to ^ette her in with
pomp. And then was the good duke of Glocetter traytourously murdered /
partly because he could judge false miracles, and partly because of the
delyuerau^ce of these two contreys. For he being a live, they durst not do it.

And when king Edward had put down king Henry^, a marriage was made and
concluded between him and the king of spaiue this queen's mother y^ now is.
But yer the Ambassadors were come home, our Prelates had be witched king
Edward by their apostle Friar bongay / and married him unto a wyddowe that was
a knyghts wife / lest if spain and Ingland had been wyned together / king
Edward should have recouured france again. But what followed after ye breaki^g
of yt marriage, between king Edward and the earl of warwick and what came of
his children? ye and what came on king Henry of windsores children also? But
what care our prelates what v^geaunce or mischefe fa^^e on princes or on their
royalmes / so their kingdom prospere?

In King Henryes days the.vij. the cardinal Murton and bishop ^ox of
winchester, delivered unto the kings grace the confessions of as many lords
as his grace lusted. Who soever was mistrusted, it he shroue him self at the
chart^rhouses sy^n Grenewich / at saint Iho^s, Confession
or where soever it wa^, the confessor was commanded by the aucthorite of the
pope to deliver his confession wryte^ and sworn that it was al. And cardinal
Murton had a lyc^nce of the pope for fourtyne, to study nycromancy^, of which
he him self was one / and other I have heard named which at this time I pass
over with scilence. And how the holy friars obseruauntes carried feyned letters
to try who was true, I pass over with silence also. How beit such temptacions
and fained profers were enough to mo^e them that never would have thought
amysse: yea and in confession men will shryue them s^lues of thoughts which
they never went about in the outward dead.

When any great man is put to death how his confessor entreats him and what
penance is enjoined him, concerning what he shall say, when he come^th unto
the place of execution / I coud guess at a practice yt might make men's ears
glowe

And did not the subtle counsel of the said two prelates feign the sege of
Bolen to make a pretense to gather in a fiftene, when there was no more war
between ye king of France and of England, then is between a man's head yt has
lust to sleep, and his pilow? Which sege yet cost many a man their lives, yea
and some great men thereto, which knew not of that faining. The kings grace
went over with a ten thousand men to co^quere all France and spent happily an
hundred thousand pound, of which he saved ye fourth part in the da^dyprattes
and gathered at home.v. or.vi. hundred or more. And two other such feigned
viages could I happly rehearse, which I pass over for diverse causes, where
many an English man lost his life. But what care they for men's lives?

And did not our cardinal with like polycy thi^cke ye / to gather y^ which he
thought would not well be paid, except the commens saw some cause, bring a
great multitude of scotts unto the english pale eth^^ by some bysshopes of
Scotland or by some great man, whom he corrupted with some yerelye pencion?
against which the po^re northen me^ / must goo on their own cos^ to keep them
out. And general processyon was commanded at London / thryse in the weke, and
through out all the land, while ^ Kings receauers gathered the tax of the
comen people. Which plage and such like after the thretning of god. Leui. xxvi.
and Deute. xxviij. and.xxix. I am sure will faule on all christendom without
cease, until they either defye the name of christ with the turckes, or if they
wylbe called christen, they turn and look on his doctrine.

Yea and what feigned the cardinal at the great love to begyle his own
pryestes / to make the^ swear what they were wroth and the better wyllyng to
pay, for the comen priests be not so obedient unto their ordinaryes, that
they will pay money except they know why. Now it is not expedye^t that every
rascal / should know the secrets of the very true cause, for many
co^syderacyons. And therefore a^ other pretense must be made and an other cause
alleged. And therefore the priests were charged by their ordynaryes to appear
before the gentelm^^ of ye court and t^mporal officers / and swea^e what every
man was worth. Now the pryestes had ^euer be slain and dye marters after the
e^sample of saint Thomas of Cau^terbur^, then to swear before a lay judge,
for they think it greater sin / then to slay their own fathers, and that
then the lyberties of the church were clean lost, and they no better then the
vile lay people. And when they were in yt perplexity that they must either
swear or run into the kings danger and lose their gods (I would say their
goods) then my lord cardenall sent down his graciouse power y^ they should
swear^ unto their ordinaryes only. And then the pryests for joy that they
were ryd out of y^ lay men's hands, were so glad and joyous, that they wyste
not what thanks to give my lord cardinal / and so were obedyent to swear
and to lend, or else for all the curses that my lord Cardinal has and the
Pope to, they would neither have sworn or paid a penny.

The practice of our time.
WHen the Kings grace came first to the right of the croune and unto the
Governance of the Royalme yo^g and inexpert, Thoms wof^e.
Thomas wolf^e a man of lust and courage, and bodelie strength to do and to
suffer great things / and to endure in all manner of voluptuousnes, expert and
exercysed in y^ course of the world, as he which had hard, red and seen much
policy and had done many things him self / and had been of the secret
council of weyghtye matters, as so^^e as simon that betraaed troy, utterly
appointed to semble and dissemble, to have one thing in the heart / and an
other in the mouth, being thereto as eloque^t as sotle and able to persuade
what he lusted to the^ that were inexpert: so desirous and gredye of honor /
that he cared not but for the next and most compendious way thereto, whether
godly or ungodly: this wylye wolf I say / and ragynge sea and shypwracke of
all England, though he showed him self pleasant and calm at the first (as
hores do unto their lovers) came unto ye kings grace and waited upon him, and
was no man so obsequious and serviceable / and in all games and sportes the
first and next at hand and as a captain to courage other and a g^ye fynder out
of new pastimes to obtain favor with all.

And thereto as the secret communicacion went, which by many tokens thou may
well conjecture and gather to be true, Bisshopes calke kings natiuities.
he calked the kings natiuiti^ and birth, which is a comen practice among
prelates, in all lands, whereby he saw whereunto the kings grace should be
inclined all his life, and what should be like to chance him at all times. And
as I hard it spoken of diverse, he made by craft of nicromancye, graven
Imagery to bear upon him, wherewith he bewitched the kings mind, and made
the king to dote upon him more then ever he did on any lady or gentil woman /
so that now the kings grace followed him, as he before followed the king. And
then what he said, that was wisdom, what he praised, that was honorable
only. Moreover in the meantime he spied out y^ naturs and disposicyons of the
kings play fellows, and of all that were great, and who^ he spyed mere for
his purposse, him he flattered, and him he made faithful with great promyses,
and to him he swear, and of him he took an oath again that the one should help
ye other for without a secret oath, he admytted no man unto any part of his
pryuities.

And ever as he grew in promocio^s and dignity, so gathered he unto him of ye
most subtle wytted, and of the^ that were drunk in the desire of honor most
like unto himself And after they were sworn / he promoted the^, and with great
promyses, made them in falshed faithful: and of them ever presented unto the
kings grace, and put the^ into his service, saying: this is a man mete for
your grace. And by these spies (if ought wear done or spoken in the court,
The king is betrayed
against y^ cardinal) of y^ he had word within an hour or two. And the^
came the cardinal to court with all his magike, to persuade ye contrary. If
any in the court had spoken against ye Cardinal, and the same not great in the
kings favor / the Cardinal bad him walk a villayne, and thrust him out of
the court headlong. If he were in conceyte wych the kings grace, the^ he
flattered, and persuaded and corrupt so^me with gifts, and sent some
Ambassadors, and some he made Captains at Calais, Ha^mes, Gynes, Iernsey and
Gersey, or sent them to Irlande and into the north, and so occupied them till
the king (...) forgotten them and other were in their rowmes / or till he had
spyed what they e^^tended.

And in like manner played he with the ladies and gentle women. the queen (...)
betrayed
Whosoever of them was great, with her, was he familiar and to her gave he
gifts* Yea: and where saint Thomas of cau^terburie was wont to com after,
Thomas Cardinal we^^ often before / preventing his prince and perverted the
order of the holte man. If any were subtle witted and mete for his porpose,
hi^ made he sworn to betray ye queen likewise^ and to tell him what she said
or did. I know one that departed the court for none other Cause then that she
would no long^^ betraye her mastresse.

And after ye same example he furnishe^ ye court with chapelains of his own
sworn disciples and children of his own bryngi^g up, to be alwaie present and
to dyspute of vanities and to water what soever the Cardinal had planted. If
among those cormora^^t^s any yet began to be to much i^ favor with the King,
and to be somewhat busye in the Court, and to draw any other way then as my
lord Cardinal had appointed / that the Plowe should goo, a nonne he was sent
to Italye or to SPAIN: or some quarrel was picked against him and so was ^^^ust
out of the court, as stokesly was.

He promoted the bishop of Lyncolne that now is, the bishop of Lincoln
his most faithful friend and old companyon / and made him conf^ssour: to whom,
of what soever ye kings grace shro^e him self, think ye not that he spoke so
loud that the Cardinal herd it? and not unright: for as Gods creatures ought
to obey God and serve his honor, so ough^ the popes creatures to obey the
pope and se^ue his magestie?

Finally Thomas wolfse became what he would, even porter of heaven, so that no
man could enter into promocion, but through him.

The cause of all that we have suffered this twentye years.
About the beginning of the Kings grace that now is / france was mighty /
so y^ I suppose it was not myghtier this five hundred years. King Jews of
France had won Naples / and had taken Bonony from saint Peter's s^. king
jews
Wherefore Pope July was wroth and cast Pope July
how to bring the frenchmen down, yet soberly lest while he brought him lower
/ he should give an occasyon to lift up the Emperor hyer. Our first viage into
Spain was to bring ye frenchmen lower. For our meyney were set in the
forefronte and borders of spain toward Gaskayne: partly to keep those
parties, and partly to fear y^ Gascaynes, and to keep them at home while in
the mean time the Spanyardes wan Nauerne. When Nauerne was won our men came
to house as many as dyed not there, and brought all there money with them home
again / save that they spend there. How beit for all the loss of Nauerne ye
frenchmen were yet able enough to match Spain, the Uenecians and the Pope with
all the Zwytzers that he could make: so yt there was yet no remedy but we
must set on ye fre^chme^ also, if they should be brought out of Italy.

Then pope July wrote unto his dear son Thomas wolfse that he would be as
good / as loving and as helping to holy church / as any Thomas ever was /
seeing he was as able. the new Thomas.
Then the new Thomas as glorious as the old / took the matter in hand and
persuaded the kings grace. And ^hen the kings grace took a dyspensatyon for
his oath made upon the apoyntment of peace between him and the French king and
promised to help the holy seat where in Pope Peter never sat. But the
Emperor Maximilian might in no wise stand still lest the frenchmen should money
him, and get aid of him / seeing the Almaynes refuse not money whence soever
it be proffered then quod Thomas wolfse, Maximli^
Oh and like your grace / what an honor should it be unto your grace if the
emperor were your sodyare? So great honor never chanced any king
christened. It should be spoken of while the world stood. The glory and honor
shall hyde and darken the cost that it shall never be seen, though it should
cost half your realm. Dixit and factum est, it was even so. And the^ a
parliament: and then pay: and then upon the French dogs* with clean
remission of all his sins, that slew one of them, Remision of sins*
or if he be slain (for the pardons* have no stre^gh to save in this life, but
in the life to come only) the^ to heaven straight without feeling of y^ pains
of purgatory.

Then came our kyne with all his might, by se and by land, and the Emperor /
with a strong army and the Spanyardes and the pope and the Uenecyans all at
once against king Jews of france. As soon as the pope had that he desired in
Italy, then peace immediatlye. And frenchmen were christen men / and pytie, yea
and great sin also were it to sheade their blood / and ye frenchkinge was the
most christen king again. And thus was peace concluded and our Inglyshmen or
rather sheep came home against winter and left their fleces behind them.
Wherefore no small number of them, while they sought them better raymente at
home, were hanged for their labor.

Why the kings sister was turned unto france.
WHen this peace was made, our holy Cardynalles and Bysshoppes (as their old
Gyse is to calke and cast.xl* L. yea an hundred year before what is like to
chance unto their kingdom) considered how the Emperor y^ now is, was most
like to be chosen Emperor after his graundfather Maximilian / for Maximilian
had already obtained of dyuerie of the ELECTOURS that is should so be.

They considered olso how mighty he should be: first, King of Spayn with all
that perteyneth thereto, wc was wont to be v.vi or.vij. kyngdo^s: then Duke of
Burgoyne Earl of Flanders, of Hollande / Zelande / and Braband, with all that
parteine thereto: then Emperor, and his brother Duke of Austrych / and his
sister queen of Hungrye. Wherefore thought our prelates, if we take not head
betymes / our kingdom is like to be troubled and we to be brought under the
fete. For this man shall be so mighty that he shall with power take out of ye
french kings hands, out of the hands of the Uenetians / and from the Pope
also, what soever parteyneth unto the empire / and what soever belongs unto
his other kyngdo^s and dommions thereto. And then he will come to Rome and be
crouned there, and so shall he ouerlooke our holy father and see what he does.
And then shall the old heretykes rise up again and say that the Pope is
Antichryste, and stir up again, and bring to light that we have hyd and
brogh^ a sleep with much cost, pain and bloudeshedyng more then this hundred
year long. Considred also that his aunte is queen of England, and his wife the
king of Engla^ds sister, consydred ye old amity between ye house of burgom,
and ye old kings of e^glo^d so yt they could never do ought i^ france with out
their help: and last of all considered yt course of marchau^dise y^ i^gla^d
has i^ those parties / and also ye natural heart yt e^glishme^ bear to
fre^chme^. Wherefore if we shall use our old practyse, and set the french king
against him: Then he shall lyghtelye obtain the favor of the king of Ingland
by the means of his Aunte and his wife, and aid with men and money. Wherefore
we must take heed betimes and break this amytie Which thing we may by this
our old craft / ^easely bring to pass. Let us take a dispensation and
break this marriage, and turn the kings sister unto ye French king If the
french King, Practyse.
get a male of her. then we shall lightly make our kyngepro, tectoure of
france / and so shall Inglande and France be coupled together, and as for the
queen of Inglande, we shall trymme her well enough, and occupye the king with
strange love / and keep her that she shall bear no rule. And as the godd^s
had spoken so it came to pass. Our fair young daughter, was sent unto the old
pocky king of france / the year before our mortal e^nemye and a myscreaunt /
worse then a Turk / and disobedient unto our holy Father, and no more
obedient yet then he was compelled to be against his will.

The cause of the journey to Calyce.
IN short space thereafter Thomas wolfse / now Cardinal and Legate a latere
and greatly desirous to be Pope also / thought it exceading expedient / for
his many secret purposes to bring our King and the King of France that now is
together: both to make a perpetual peace and amity between them, and that
(while the two kings and their lords dalyed together) the great cardinals
and Bisshoppes of both parties, might becraye them both / and the Emperor and
all Christen kings thereto.

Then he made a journey of gentelmen arrayed all together in sylk, so much as
their very shows and lynynge of their boutes, much more like their mothers
then me^ of war: yea I am sure y^ many of their mothers would have been
ashamed of so ny^^ and wanton array: how beit they went not to make war but
peace for ever and a day longer. But to speak of the Pompouse apparel of my
lord him self and of his chaplaynes, it passes the.xij. apostles. I dare
swear that if Peter and Paul had seen them suddenly and at a blush / they would
have been harder in believe that they or any such should be their successors /
then Thomas ^^dimus was to believe yt Christ was risen again from death.

When all was concluded between the king of France and ours, that Thomas
wolf^e had devised / and when the prelates of both parties had cast their penny
worthes against all chances and devised remedies for all mischeues^ Then the
right reverend father in God Thomas cardinal and Lega^^, would go se the young
Emperor newlye chosen unto the room, and have a certain secret
communicacion with some of his prelates also. And gatte him to bridges in
Flaunders, Prelates
where he was received with great solempnitie as belongs unto so mighty a
pyllar of Christ's church, and was saluted at the entering into the town of a
merry fellow which said, salve rex regis tui atque regni sui. saluta^io^*^
Hayle both king of the king and also of his realm. And though there were never
so great strife between the Emperor and the French king / yet my lord
Cardynall iugled him favor of them both / and finally brought the Emperor to
Calays, unto the kings grace, where was great tryumphe / and great love / and
amytie showed on both parties in so much that certain men maruelynge at it,
asked the old bisshope of Deram. How it might be that we were so great with
the Emperor so shortly upon so strong and ever lasting a peace made
between us and the frenchmen, the Emp^rour and the king of France being so
mortal enemies? My lord answered that it might be well enough if he wist al.
A certain secret.
But there was a certain secret said he, whereof all men knew not. Yea verily /
they have had secrets this.viij hundred years, which, though all the lay me^
have felt the^, yet few have spyed them, save a few Iudases which for lucre
have been co^federate with them, to betray their own kings and all other.

Then were we indifferent and slode still. And the Emperor and the French
king wrastled together. And Ferdinandus the Emperors brother wanne Mylane of
y^ frenchmen / and the Emperor turnay our great conqueste which yet after so
great cost in Building a Castle, Milane. Turnay.
we delivered up again unto the frenchmen in ernest and hope of a marriage
between the dolphine and our princess.

How the Emperor came through England.
AFter that the Emperor would into Spain and came through England where he was
receive with great honor and with all that pertayneth to love and amyte. The kings
grace lent him money and promised him more. And the Emperor should tarry a
certain years and mary our princess: Not that the cardinal intended that
thou may be su^e, for it was not proffitable for their kingdom, but his mind
was to dallye with the Emperor and to keep him without a wife that (in so much
as he was young and lusty) he might have been noselled and entangeled with hores
(which is their nurteri^g Nurteri^g. of kings.
of kings) and made so effeminate and that he should never have been able to
lift up his heart to any goodness or virtue: that cardinals and bysshopes
might have administered his dominions in the mean time unto our holy fathers
profit.

The king of france hearing the favor that was showed unto the Emp^roure,
sent immediatlye a diffiaunce unto our king, not without our cardinals and
bisshops counsel, thou may well wit.

For frenchmen are not so folish to have done it so unadvisedly and so rashlye
/ seeing they had to many in their tops already. Then our king spoke many
great words that he would drive the frenchkyng out of his realm, or else the
frenchkyng should bryue him out of his* But had he added as the legate Pandulph
taught king Ihon^ / with the popes license, his words had sounded much
better. For there can no vow stand in effect / except the holy father confirm
it.

We sent out our sodiars, two summers against the frenchmen / unto whose chief
captains the Cardinal had appointed, how far they should go, and what they
should do* And therefore the frenchkyng was nothing afraid / but brought all his
Power against the Emperor in other places. And ^o was the Emperor ever
betrayed. And thus the cardinal was ye emperors friend openly, and the
frenchkinges secretly, For at the m^^^ng / with the frenchkinge besyd Cal^s,
he utterly betrayed the Emperor* yet for no love that he had to France, but
to help the Pope, yea and to have been Pope happily / and to save their
kingdom. Which treason / though all the world smelled it, yet it brake not out
openly to the eye / till the sege of Pauye. And the Cardynall sent the
emperor much monye openly / and gave the Frenchkyng more secretelye. He
played with both hands to serve their secret* that all me^ know not, as the
bishop of Deram said. But what soever the frenchmen did, they had ever the
worse, no^ withstondyng the secret workyng of our holy prelates on their side.

Fynallye unto the sege of Pauye came the Frenchkyng parsonallye with.lx.
thousand men of war, Pauye.
of which.xij, thousand were horsemen, and with money enough And the Emperors
host was under.xx. thousand, of which were but.iij. thousand horsemen, with no
money at all. For he trusted unto the Pope for aid of men, and unto our
Cardynall for money. But the Pope kept back his men till that the fre^chme^
had given them a field, and our Cardinal kept back his money for the same
purpose. And thus was the selye Emperor betrayed, as all his predecessors
have been this.viiij. hundred years. How be it there be that sa^e, how that the
Emperors sodiars so thretened Pace, Pace^
the kings graces embassadoure, that he was feign to make che^esaunce with
merchants for money in the kings name, to pay the soldyars with all.
Wherefore the cardinal took from him all his promocions, and played torme^tours
with him when he came home, because that he presumed to do one Iore more the^
was in his commission But how so ever it was, ye emperors me^, in tarieng for
help / had spent out all their vitayles. Whereupon Burbon the chief captain of
the Emperor said unto his under captains: ye se, Burbo^
help comes not, and that our vitales are spent. Wherefore there is no remedy
but to fight though we be unequally matched. If we win, we shall find meat
enough: if we loose, we shall loose no more th^n we must lose with hu^gre /
though we fight not. And so they concluded to set upon ye Frenchmen by night.
The king of france and his lorde^ purposing that the moon would sooner have
faullen out of the sky, then that the Emperoures host durst have fought with
them / were some what negligent, and went the same night a mummynge that Burbon
set upon them. The Emperors host therefore with their sodayn coming upon
the^, amassed the frenchmen / and drove them upon heaps to gether one on an
other, so yt they never could com in array again, and took the king and
diverse of his lords and slew many and wanne the field. And there came out all
the Cardinals preuye treason / for in the frenchkinges tent (say men) were
letters found / and beside that in the Frenchkyngs treasure, and in all the
host among the sodiars were englysh ships found innumerable which had come
saylynge a thousand miles by land. But what wonder, ships be made to sail
over the sea, and wings to fle into far contrees and to mount to ye top of
hye hills.

When the frenchkyng was taken, we sang Te deum. But for all that singynge we
made peace with frenchmen. And the Pope, Te deum.
the Uenecians, France and England were knyt to gether, lest the Emperors
army should do any hurt in france Whereby ye may conjecture of what mind ye
pope and ye cardinal were to ward ye e^perour* and with what heart our spiritualty
with their invisible secrets, sang Te deu^. And from ye time hitherto / ye
emperor and our cardinal have been twain.

After that, when the king of fraun^^ was delivered home again / and his
sons left in pledge, many ways were sought to bring home the sons also:
But in vain / except ye frenchking would make good ye which he had promised the
Emperor. For the bringing home of those Chylderne no Man more busyed his
wits / then the Cardinal. He would in any wise the emperor should have sent
the^ home / and it had been but for our kings pleasure, for the great
kindness that he showed him i^ times past. He would have married the kings
daughter our princess unto the Dolphine again, or as the voice went among
many, unto the second Brother, and he should have been prince in England and
king in time to come, so that he sought always to pluck us from the Emperor
and to join us unto France, to make france strong enough to match the
Emperor / and to keep him down, that the pope might reygne a GOD alone, the
mart should have been at Ca^^^ce.
and do what pleased him / without countrollynge of any ouerseer. And for the
same purpose, he left nothing unprovided to bring the mart from Andwerp^ to
Cales.

This be sufficient at this time, though I could say more, and though other
have deserved that I more said: ye and I could more depely have e^tred into the
practice of our cardinal, but I spare for diverse consyderacions, and namely
for his sake / which never spared me / nor any faithful friend of his own,
nor any that told him truth, nor spares to persecute the blood of Christ in
as clear light as ever was, and under as subtle color of ypocrysy as ever
was any persecution syns the creation of the world. Neither have I said for
hate of any parson or parsons (God I take to record) but of their wickedness
only, and to call them to repentance / knowledginge that I am a sinner also,
and that a grievous. How beit, it is a deuelysh thing and a mercylesse to defend
wickedness against the open truth, and not to have power to repent. And therefore
I doubt not, if men will not be warned hereby, but that God will utter more
practice by whom he will, and not cease, until he have broken the band of
the wytye hypocrytes / which persecute so subtylly.

And finally, let them remember that I, to prevent all occasyons and all
carnal beasts that seek fleshly liberty, sent forth the true obedience of a
Chryste^ man with yet they condemned, but after they had conde^pned the new
testament, as right was, whence the obedience had his aucthorytie. Now the^ if
when the light is come abroad in wc their wickedness can not be hyd, they
find no such obedience in the people unto their old tyranny, whose fault is
it? This is a sure conclusyon: none obedience yt is not of love can long
endure: and in your deeds can no man see any cause of love: and the knoledge of
Christ, for whose sake only a man would love you, though ye were never so
evil, yea persecute. Now then if any disobedience rise / are ye not the cause
thereof your selves?

Say not but that ye be warned.
