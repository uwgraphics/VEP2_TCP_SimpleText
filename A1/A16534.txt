WHen thy sweet Sophoclean strains I read,
Motions of Love, and Admiration breed
Within my breast; for thy soule-charming Songs
(To whom the Laurel as thy due belongs)
Have rais'de in Me hot flammes of kind Desire
That I must love Thee still, and still admire,
Thy glorious choice, and with deserved praise
Stir up thy Muse, a higher flight to raise,
Well do Thou now disclaim that Dwarfling fond,
And builds thy Thoughts upon a divine ground.

DOOMES-DAY Containing, HELLS horror, and HEAVENS happiness. By Sr WILLIAM
MVRE yo: of Rowallane Knight
1
BUT now, my Sprite refresht a space,
Forbearing pressed steps to trace
Aspires above the vulgar prease, to raise a second flight.
I feel my bosom piece and piece
Warmde with unusual flammes: Give place
Eare-charming fancies, Arts disgrace, affoording false delight.
2
Thoughts, which above the spheres inclyne,
Wings, furnish to my weak engine,
If Thou, O Lord, the 2. Sam. ^^.3.
Horn of Thine in me, this Rapture wrought
Be present by thy power divine,
Grant in my lines thy might may shine,
From dross of sin, my spr'ite refine, raise from the earth my thought.
3
But why thus pants thou in my breast
Affrighted soul, deprivde of rest?
What sudden fears thy joys molest, what jarres disturb thy peace?
Why tremblest thou, with terrors pressed,
To hear that fearful doom expressed
By that great Judge, who ever blessed is just, as full of grace.
4
Here pause a space, (My Soul) acquent
Thy self this judgment to prevent:
No moment of our time is spent, which thither does not lead.
The dangers seen, which do torment
Thy troubled mind with discontent
against them, let fervent suits be sent Jmmunitie to plead.
5
Haste, haste my Soul, shake off delay,
Which too much of thy time makes prey
Lay up provision for that Day, there boldly to arrive.
Where Reprobats, accursed for aye,
Shall wish in vain their life's decay,
That earth would to their souls make, way^ them swallowing up alive.
6
Oh! what encounter sad shall be
Twixt souls, from darkness chains set free,
And bodies, mates in misery calde forth, to be combynd,
Not for reciprocal supply
As friends new joynde in amity,
But never dying, aye to die, in quenchlesse flammes confynde.
7
Deaths loathsome den, detested Jayle,
Scout, following sin with stretched sail,
Which fleeting froaths, which pleasures frail,
On Rock of shipwreck led.
Mask of mischief, sins slender veil,
Good Motions ever bent to quail,
Which in the birth thou did assail
Them burying as they bred.
8
Wretch, who to pamper dust, did doat,
Whom Hell attends with open throat,
Ready to retribute the lote to thy deservings due.
Oh! what has violate deaths knot,
That still in grave thou did not rot,
Mass overspred with sins foul spot, raisde, anguish to renew?
9
Thus (too too late) the Soul shall rail;
Re-entring this abhorred Iayle,
Which recombynd, while both bevaile
Life's misgoverned raines,
Then Angels shall to Judgment hail.
There, whence no party can appeal,
To hear deaths sentence countervaile,
Lyfes Joys, with endless pains.
10
O wretch, who Judgment here delays,
Whom false security betrays,
Who never thy Sins black sum surveyes which future anguish breeds.
Then, shall the Ancient of days
Who all men's works in balance lays,
Examine all thy words, thy ways, thy thoughts, thy foul misdeedes.
11
None shall this search ^euere eschew,
From books laid open to his view,
A summar process shall ensew, conform to thy trespass.
Thy sins all summond, Thee which slew,
Approving thy damnation due,
When all the blessed celestial crew, shall on thee, ver^ict pass.
12
Thou, who to lewdness now art prone,
What shame, what smart, (lifs pleasures gone)
Shall on thee feaze, when gazde upon
By earth, by angry heaven?
When naked, comfortless, alone
Thou trembling stands before the Throne,
Under Gods wrath, guilts load do groan, fears, with thy faults made eaven.
13
When thy tormenting conscience torn,
Thou guilty stands that Judge beforne
Whose Image did thy soul adorn, who did infuse thy breath.
Who pitying thee to sin forlorn,
Left heavens, was of an earthling borne,
Liu'de loathed, did with contempt and ^corne emptyed the Cup of wrath.
14
Witness, earth trembling at his pains,
Days beam, which all in clouds detaines,
The silver Moon, which pale remains, for horror of the sight.
Witness his hands, with bleeding veins,
Of this great All which holds the raines,
His side pierced through to purge thy stains, polluted sinful wight.
15
Where shall thou then safe shelter find
Soul, than the sightlesse Mole more blind,
When with those straits extreme confynd faint, pale, confusde thou stands?
By doom, which cannot be declinde,
Adjudgde for ever to be pinde,
Where day nere dawnde, Sun never shinde among the infernal bands.
16
Where tears no truce, playnts find no plac^
On either hand in desperate case,
Behind thee, who thy paths did trace, attend thy woeful lote,
Before thee flamms, Earths frame deface
Above, an angry Judges face,
Below, Thee gaping to embrace,
Hells sulphure-smoking throat.
17
Thy fears, shall be with cries encrest
Of damned Souls, with anguish pressed
With grief, with horror vnexprest, of due deserved ire.
The fyre-brands of a conscious breast,
Shall of thy terrors not be least,
While worms, which on thy conscience feas^ thy easlesse pain conspire.
18
But when (most like a thunder dart)
That separating doom, Mat. 25.41.
Depart,
Pronounced, shall pierce thy panting heart, with a most fearful knell.
Which shall thee from Gods presence part,
Exposde to torments, that impart
Nor end of time, nor ease of smart, while headlongs hurld in hell.
19
Their shall thou dive in depthes profound,
Still sink but never meet a ground,
In waves still wrestling to be drowned, deluded still by death;
Crying, where comfort none is found,
Pynde, where no pity rage does bound,
Thy Cup, with floods of vengeance crownde of the Almighties wrath.
20
Bathde in a bottomless abisse,
Pain still encressing, never remiss,
Where Scorpions sting, where serpents hiss, worms, never satiate, gnaw.
Rackt, thinking what thou was, now is,
Deprivde for aye from hope of bliss,
For toys, eternal joy did miss, nor crub't by love, nor aw.
21
No Torment does it self extend
Here, Pain of sense.
all the members to offend,
Which universal grief does send, does every part entrinch:
There pains, which reasons reach transcend
On soul and body both descend,
No joint, nerve, muscle, without end but several plagues do pinch.
22
Lascivious Eye, with objects light
Which erst did entertain thy sight,
Weep, there exylde in endless night locked up in horride shads.
Nyce Ear, whose Organ erst did spite,
All sounds, whence flowde no falls delight
There, horror ever and affright thy curious sense vpbraids.
23
Smell, erst with rare pe^fumes acquent,
Still interchangde to please thy sent,
For incense, sulphur (there) does vent, smoke for thy odoures sweet.
Taste, unto which to breed content,
Robt were the Earth, Sea, Firmament,
Among souls, which penury torment
There, famine Thee does meet.
24
Vile wormeling, Thou whose tender pride,
The weakest Sunshine, scarce could bide,
There, plungde in this impetuous tide, must feel the force of fire.
Where damned souls on every side,
Howling and roaring still abide,
Which find no shelter them to hyde from this eternal ire.
25
There, the Ambitious, who in skies
Did (late) on wax-joynde wings arise,
Of base contempt is made the pryse, the Proudling pestred down.
There Dives, who did erst despise
Of famisht souls, the piercing cries,
Shall one cold drop of water pryse above a Monarchs crown.
26
Lo, there the vile licentious Goat
Whom lawless lust did ^arst besotte,
Enchainde in the embracements hot of furious raging flames.
There, to the drunkards parched throat,
Justice, does scrotching drought allote
In floods of fire, which judgde to floate still vain refreshment claims.
27
On Covetous, on cruel wight,
Shall equal weight of vengeance light,
With biting usury, with spite, the poor ones who did press.
So to the remnant that did fight,
against heavens decrees, their conscience light,
Gods wrath shall be proportionde right, by measure, more or less.
28
Soul, which vnpittied ever playnes,
Here, suffering for thy sins soul staynes
Flammes, lashing whips, rackes, fyrie chains tormenting outward sense.
Of all most terrible remains,
Loss of Gods face, Pain of loss.
while thou sustains.
O hell of hell! O pain of pains! still to be banished thence.
29
But when thou have as many years
Those tortures felt, as shine in spears
Lights, fixed and straying, eyes have tears or waves the azure Plain,
No nearer are their end those fears,
Ever beginning, which thou bears,
No change abates, no date outweares, thy ever pinching pain.
30
O dying life! O living death;
O stinging fire, blown by Gods breath;
O boiling lake, no ground which has, destroying naught it burns!
O overflowing flood of wrath,
Which damned souls are drencht beneath,
O pit profound, O woeful path; whence, Entrer never returns.
31
Sweet Romans 5.10.
Reconciler, Prince of peace,
Who pitying Man's most wretched case,
Did hellish agonies embrace in soul, in body shame,
Let me in those extremes find grace,
Illightned by thy glorious face,
Rankt among thy Saints, the elect race whose ways thou did proclaim.
32
O! let me safe protection plead
Unto my soul, which full of dread,
Hanges over Hell, by life's frail thread conservde but by thy might,
That when, heavens, whence it did proceed,
Its separation have decreed,
With genesis 8.8.
Noah's Dove, Thou may it lead there whence it first took flight.
33
Oh, how it longes, on wings to rise,
(Secure from sins contagious dies)
Endenizde citizen of skies
with Thee, for aye to rest.
Oh, how it does the Jayle despise,
In fleshes fetters, it which ties,
And lets it, to enjoy the pryse,
with which thy Saints are blessed.
34
For Thee I thirst, O living spring,
Pure source of life, who guides faiths wing,
By flight, to reach the highest thing,
to compass things most hard.
When shall Thou me from danger bring
To Port of peace, my God, my King,
Blessed giver, and the gifted thing?
rewarder, and reward?
35
When shall J from exile set free
My native home, my country see?
When one immortal Pineons fly,
that holy City reach?
Whose streets pure gold, gold buildings be

Walls, stones most precious beautify,
Ports solid Pearls, Guests never die,

Eternal spring, (shrill Winter gone,)
This Climate constant makes alone,
Nor flamming heat, nor frozen Zone

From Lambs sweet breath, on glories throne
Enstalde, are balmie odours thrown,
Time has no turns, here change is none,
no seasons do succeed.
37
Pale envy, emulation, spite,
Nor death, nor danger here affright,
Here hopes nor fears, nor false delight,

The Lambs sweet face here shines ay bright,
Which of the Saints does bless the sight
who do in him rejoyse.
38
Here simple beauty scorneth Art,
Rose-cheeked youth, old ages dart,
Joys perpetuity impart,
no war disturbs this peace.
O this Gods Palace royal art
Preparde in these, 1. Pet. 1.20.
with all desert
For all that upright are in heart,
ere light did paynt heavens face.
39
Thou, by whose pow're the spheres are rol^
Earths hanging Orb, who do uphold,
Great Architect, King uncontrolled,
Lord of this Universe,
E^stalde here on a Throne of gold,
Do diamantine scepter hold,
Give Laws to earth, hence do behold
how wights below converse.
40
If here, such eye-enchaunting sights,
Amazing beauties, choice delights,
This Mansion low, of dying wights
Earths brittle Orb adorn,
What wonders then, what glorious lights,
Must beautify those reachlesse hights,
Thy blessed aboade, which days, which nig^
vicissitude does scorn?
41
If these such admiration breed,
What Thou, who did heavens Curtain sprea
Earth stayde midst air, that it does need
its weight naught to sustain.
Who full of Majesty and dread,
Of intellectual powers do plead
Attendance, on thy face which feed,
O ever blessed train!
42
Archangels, Angels, clothde with might,
Thrones, Cherubs, Seraphins of light,
Princes and Powers all shining bright,
Dominions, virtues pure.
With beams that sparkle from the sight,
^nflamde, which fly no other flight
But satiat rest, rapt with delight,
which does for aye endure.
43
O sweet society! how blessed
They, who these orders have encreast,
From labor free, in peace who rest
surpassing humane sense?
Where bless, where glory does invest
Apostles, Martyrs, and the rest
Of holy Saints, with tortures pressed,
to death, in Trueths defense.
44
The Patriarchs, Prophets, Lights divine,
(Clear stars on earth) bright suns here shine
Here all the elect host, deaths line
which yet have ouerpast.
Incorp'rat to their Head, incline
One way, Joys common all combine,
This band no discord can untwine,
love does eternal last.
45
1. Cor. 4.6.
Of glory amongst these bands elect,
Degrees there are, but no defect,
Dan. 1^.3.
Full vessels all, none can expect
more, than the lest contains.
Man's heart no pleasure can project,
But greater does from hence reflect,
One cause, in all works one effect,
of measure none complains.
49
O Joys! my drossie sprite, which wing
Upwards, above the spheres to spring,
(Times Father) where thy praises ring,
which Saints, which Angels raise:
Apoc. 9.^.
Where all around Thee in a ring
Heavens hoasts, high Allelujahs sing,
O heavenly consort! Blessed King,
blessed people, Thee who praise.
47
No woeful earth-confined wight,
With Owlish eyes can view this light:
The weak horizon of Man's sight,
far, far which does outreach,
This inexpressible delight,
Does reasons dazelde eye benight,
What J cannot conceive aright,
Lord, let experience teach.
48
Give me, that in some measure small
(While fleshes bands my sprite enthrall)
^ may, a far, a glance let fall,
at these contentments point,
These termlesse Joys which (one day) shall
In honny, turn Saints bitter gall,
From guilt, when flamms shall purge this Ball
this Engine hudge disjoynt,

When the Archangels voice shall raise
The graves pale guests, 1 Cor. 15 50.

Around all burning in a blaze, 1. These. 4 16.

suffering for man's offense.
What Joys, then, sleeping Saints shall seize
How much this long-longde sight them please
This sight, deaths fetters which shall ease,
all passed cares, compense?
50
O what a happy hour! how dear,
How glorious shall this day appear
To thee my Soul, when fred from fear,
grimme death, thou dare outface?
When (thy redemption drawing near)
Life's toils shall trophies to Thee rear, luke. 21.28.

Which cankring Time shall never outweare,
nor foes despite de^ace.
51
Though tyrants, have by doom unjust
In furious flammes thy carcass thrust,
Not d^igning It, to earth to trust
with honor of a grave,
No Atome of thy scattered dust,
But see this solemn Meeting must,
Purgde from corruption, from rust
of sin did It deprave.
52
Thy shape renewde, more glorious made
Than when it entered deaths dark shade,
Raisde by his viuifying aid,
Deaths powers who did control.
With flesh adornde, which never shall fade,
Nor rotte in earthes cold bosom laid,
But live for aye the Mansion glade,
of a Triumphing soul.
53
No beauty, nature brought'to light
Did ravish most amazed sight,
Which, as far short, from day as night,
from This, shall not be found,
Which shall adorn each newborn wigh^

Caught up, 1 These. 4 17. 1. Cor. 6.^.
when on immortal wings
To air, this stage which ouerhings,
To meet thy Head, the Saints who brings,
to judge the damned train.
(Saints, erst accounted abject things,
Objects of scorn, weak underlings,
On thrones enstalde, now sceptred Kings
Eternally who reign) Apoc. 10,

55
What bands enclustred thee around,
Shall make the Heavens with hymns rebound,
That Thou a straggling sheep art found,
their numbers to increase? Luke 15.7.

^f they did such applauses sound
At thy conversion, how profound
Shall be their Joys, to see thee crowned,
with them to acquiesse?
56
As pansiue Pilgrim, sore distressed,
Weary and weak, with famine pressed,
Whom fear of Robbers does infest,
straying alone, in need.
If He, while dreaming least of rest,
Should in an instant, be addressed,
Where, he might live, for ever blessed,
how should his Joys exceed?
57
Even so my soul (now on the way)
Too easily seduc't astray,
When Thou shall find this solid stay,
this Center of repose.
How shall the pleasures of this day,
Adorning Thee, with rich array,
Thy suffered labors all allay,
afflictions all compose.
58
What boundless Ocean of delight
Shall quench all pains, all passed plight,
Endured wrongs, digested spite,
of tyrannizing pride?
Mat. 14 31.
By Angels, Messengers of light,
When brought in thy Redeemers sight,
Set free, from deaths eternal night
adjudg't, in bless to bide.
59
Mat. 25.34.35.36.
When large Memorials shall record
The meanest good, thou did afforde,
To poor, to sick: when deed, nor word
shall want the own reward:
1 Ioh. ^.1
The Judge, thy Advocate, thy Lord:
Who now absolves, Thee, first restorde:
O bond! O double-twisted cord!
O vndeservde regard.
60
But O! when Thou casts back thine eyes,
Thy voyage dangerous espyes
Foes ambushments, laid to surprise,
thy ways when thou do vieu,
The trains set forth Thee to entise,
Base pleasures, which Thou did despise,
What boundless joys shall thence arise?
what Solace sweet ensue?
61
What strange applauses thence shall spring?
When Saints do shout, when Angels sing?
When Heavens hie vaults, loud Eccho's ring,
of that Absolving voice? Mat. 25 34.

Come Ye, whose faith did upwards spring
Contempt who on the World did fling,
Blessed of that great Sky-ruling King.
Enter in endless Joys.
62
O Joys, with these as far vn-even
To Man which to conceive are given,
As loftiest of the Planets seven
earths Center does transcend. Genesis 3 24.

(By wit, who prease to pry in heaven,
Back by a Cherubin is driven)
Man's Reason is a v^ssell riven,
can little comprehend.
63
O Joys, as much bedazling sight,
As day's bright Beam, the weakest light,
Above small Gnats, as Eagles flight
amidst the clouds ensphearde,
Joys, as far passing all delight,
Yet ever heard by humane wight,
As ghastly screiches of Owls, which fright,
with Larks sweet laves comparde.
64
These boundless Joys, 1 Cor. 13 12.
this endlese peace,
In this, claims principally place,
To see God clearly, face to face,
Him, 1. Ioh. 3.2.
as He is, to view.
(Not here, as does frail Adams race,
Who through a glass this sight embrace,
And steps of things created trace,
to reach these pleasures true.)
65
With Judgment pure, to know, as known,
These Persons three, in essence One,
God varying in names alone,
Father, Son, holy Ghost.
To know, why Man to lewdness prone
(Angels o'repast) God did repone,
In state of grace, why mercy shown
To Some, while damnde are Most.
66
Which Joys, on all the Saints elect,
On souls and bodies both reflect,
By ravishing the Intellect,
the Memory and will.
Which all the Senses do affect
With pleasures far above defect,
Who can the rich contents detect,
those blessed Bands which fill?
67
How more perspectiue, pure and free,
(Sequestered from mortality)
The Understanding faculty,
how prompter it perceiues:
How more sublime the Object be,
The Union inward, and more nie:
Joys, of a more supreme degrie,
the Intellect conceaues.
68
Here charged with chains of flesh and blood,
We apprehend by Organs roode,
The drossie minds of Earths weak brood,
imaginde knowledge swells:
There, bathing in a boundless floode
Of bless, we shall, (as sprites which stood)
Know, (vnpust up) our Sovereign good*
In him, all creatures else.
69
What object can, in greatness, hight,
In glory, majesty, in might,
This parallel, whence all delight,
all pleasure, only springs?
With rays of vncreared light
Which cherish, not offend the sight,
Who shines most blessed, for ever bright,
eternal King of Kings.
70
What Union, can so strict be found,
So firm, successionlesse, profound,
Man's deepest speculation, drowned
is in this vast abisse.
This gulf, this Ocean without ground,
The ravished mind does wholly bound,
It drencht herein, with glory crowned
bathes in a Sea of bless.
71
If charming sounds, ensnaring sights,
In minds of wonder-strucken wights
Do move, such violent delights
as pass the bounds of speech,
The Joys then midst these reachlesse hights,
Ay bright with euer-burning lights,
Must far transcend the loftiest flights,
wits most profound can reach.
72
The fluide Joys, which here entise,
From things corruptible arise,
No Union, but external, ties
the sense and object frail:
How should we then these pleasures prise,
Which ever last above the skies?
This Union strict, all change defies,
this bond can never fail.
73
What superexellent degrees
Of Joy, the Jntellect shall seize?
When It, with clear, vnsyled eyes
the speces, natures, strength,
Of beasts, of birds, of stones, of trees,
Of herbs, the hid proprieties,
Th'essentiall differences sees
of Creatures all at length?
74
Of Joy, what ouerflowing spaite,
Inunding this Theater great,
Drench with delight shall every state
here marshalled above?
Till now, even from the Worlds first date,
When Saints secure from sins deceate,
Their Palms, 2 Timothy 4 8.
their Crowns receive, who late
earths utmost spite did prove.
75
Nor shall the knowledge of the pain,
The torments which the damned sustain,
The cryms which erst their souls did stain,
impare these joys divine:
These black Characters show most plain
Gods justice, their deserved bane,
The brightness of the blessed train
oppo^de, more clear does shine.
76
Their Vengeance, shall the Just rejoyse,
(Heavens bless comparde with hels annoyes)
As erst by regal Prophets voice,
divinely was foretold.
Saints should encompassed with Joys, Psalm. 58.10.

Bathe in their blood, whom death destroys
Happy, who so his life employes,
among Saints to be enrold.
77
Here often (with wonder rapt) we find,
The punishment with virtuous mind,
The fault with the reward combinde,
at which the lust repines.
There, fault with punishment confinde
Reward, to virtuously inclinde,
Eternal justice vndeclinde,
impartially assigns.
78
As these, and more joys vnexprest,
The Understanding do invest,
As in the Center of its rest,
So here, the will does pause
In peace, which cannot be encrest,
Not wrestling passions to digest;
O calm tranquillity! how blessed
They, whom this loadstone draws.
79
Hence spring, such ardent flammes of love
To God, to all the Saints above,
That not one joy, these hoasts do prove
which It, do not delight,
Hence, It, no fewer joys do move,
Then God, Copartners does approve,
Joys infinite, which never remove
nor weakened are by slight.
80
As souls, which horride shads enchaine,
This, do not feel their meanest pain,
With mates most hated to remain
for aye, by just decreite:
How happy then, this glorious train,
With these, eternally to reign,
Who mutual love, do entertain,
Insep'rablie unite?
81
From thence a quiet calm Content
A sympathyzing sweet concent,
Satietie which vnacquent
with loathing, does arise.
Man here in earths ignoble tent,
Desires unbounded still torment,
The more he has the more is bent
things fading to comprise.
82
O soul, which life does here expose
To inward fears, to outward foes,
Deluded by deceaving show's
with shads of seeming bless,
When with content, thy Cup oreflows
When hopes nor vast desires thou knows,
How dear shall be this sweet repose
which aye beginning is?
83
O Peace! on which all hap depends,
Man's understanding, which transcends
To Thee alone, our labor tends,
our Pilgrimage aspires.
Happy, in Thee, his life who spends,
In Joy, in peace, which never ends,
To present toils, which solace sends
encentring our desiros.
84
By perfect Justice, what excess
Of Joy shall to the will accresse?
Out-shining Adams righteousness
in innocent estate?
(But O! this Joy, who can express?
Not tongues of Angels, Man's much less,
O ravished Soul, here acquiesse,
drencht in this Ocean great)
85
His Reason, Adams sense, and will
Did serve, this God: but changeable
Was this submission, now, but still
All do themselves subject
To God: by bond most durable,
Fearing no fall, secure from ill,
Rendering the soul most am'able
to God, self, Saints elect,
86
O soul dejected, plungde in fear,
Which stinging thoughts, minds horrors tear
Thy wounded sprite, who can not bear,
with inward terrors torn.
O how invaluable! how dear,
Would this integrity sincere
To Thee (in conscience rackt) appear,
which does the saints adorn?
87
This innocence which does exclude
All spots, polluting, earths frail brood,
Pure, vndistainde, perfectly good,
free from least sinful thought:
Saints aye refreshing with that food
Of Gods wingde messengers, which stood
Confirmde in grace by purple floode,
which Man's redemption wrought,
88
Nor shall less measure of content
To Memory of Saints present
How life's small period here was spent,
encompassed with cares.
From wars most pitiful event
If settled, sweetest peace is spent,
The soul, which erst did most lament
joys most, now fred of tears.
89
Of passed sight, the doubtsome fate
The Soldier does with joye relate.
The sea-tosde wight, in dangers great,
if gone, most pleasure finds.
Past miseries inunding spaite,
Most sweetens Saints triumphing state,
Foes spoils, which no invasion threat,
less ravish noble Minds,
90
From passions fred, for happiest lote,
Their purest parts which did bespot^e,
Struggling, as exhalations hot
in humide clouds inclosde;
From slights of darts, the World forth shot
(Entisements, which the best besotte)
While these in their remembrance floar,
how much are they rejoysde?
91
Revoluing in this calmest peace,
How God, by his preventing grace,
Our steps restrain'de, whilst we did trace
the tempting paths of death,
Of monstrous Sins in hottest chase,
How, He in love did us embrace;
In this to joye, Saints ne'ere shall cease,
while they in bless do breath.
92
The long vicissitude of years,
Of Times, the Memory endeares,
Since Worlds first Age, above the spheres,
of blessed celestial bands.
Which, while this Company admires,
Cause of these changes, clear appears
In Providence large book, which bears
Records of Seas, of Lands.
93
In this great Volumne, read they shall
Why Angels first, first Man did fall,
Why God did This, not These recall, of his eternal grace.
Why He did Abrams seed enstall,
Peculiar most of Nations all,
And why to Gentiles these made thrall, were planted in their place.
94
In these great Archives, scrold is found,
Why dearest Saints are trod to ground,
By Tyrants pride, to which no bound
often is below assignde.
To wit, more glorious to be crowned
As their affections did abound
Joys may proportional redound,
as cresses them confinde.
95
Nor shall the Body now all bright, Mat. 12 4^.

The fellow soldier of the spright.
Be frustrate of these Joys, by right
of its redemption due.
Of all, the Noblest sense, the Sight
Impassible, not harmde by light
Above all measure shall delight,
amazde with wonders new.
96
How shall the ravished Eye admire,
When Suns past number, Mat. 13 43.
do appear?
Darkning that spark, our hemi-spheare,
which cleeres with cheerful rays.
On all hands, Naught, when far and near
Encounters sight, but objects clear,
Blessed Empyrean bands, which wear
Crowns, Palms, immortal bays.
97
How shall this Beauty us amaze?
How on this glory shall we gaze?
How on our bodies, which do blaze
with brightest beams of light?
Our bodies which ere death did seize,
(Death which no prayers can appease)
Most loathsome burdens were to these
whom most they now delight.
98
What breast can bound this joys full spaite,
To see fallen Angels chayrs of state,
Filde with our friends, familiars late,
Love long dissolvde, renewde?
To see, to know (O wonder great)
Saints all, all times did here relate
Since Abels blood (a long-long date)
his brothers hands imbrued. Genesis 48

99
By force of flammes, which all subdue,
When brought to naught, this worlds false show
Of Heaven, P t. 3.3.
of earth, the fabric new
what wonders shall afford?
Things, 9. Rev: 2.
which before we never knew,
Charming our euer-gazing view,
With pleasures endless, perfect, true,
which tongue cannot record.
100
But none of all these objects rare,
Can with thy sight, O Christ, compare,
Fullness of Joy reflecteth there
on these, at thy right hand.
Jn Righteonsnesse, Psalm. 17.15.
thy face preclare,
Who viewing, satisfied are,
For which'a place, Thou did prepare
before thy Throne to stand.
101
If that great Herald of Heavens King,
Record of Thee, sent forth, to bring,
For Joy, did in thy presence spring,
an Embrion, yet unborn.
Jf yet a babe, thy sight benign,
So Simeans soul with joy did sting,
That he his Obsequies did sing,
With age and weakness worn.
102
If Eastern Sages spar'de ^o pain
By Pilgrims toils, thy sght to gain,
An infant, borne, but to be slain,
in manger, meanly laid;
What soul then can ^ese joys contain
Which shall arise to se Thy reign?
The glory of thy heavenly train,
whose pomp shall never fade.
103
But O! (Me thinks) of heavenly lays
A Confort sweet my sense betrays,
By Organs of min: Ear, allayes
all mind-remoding cares.
Above time, moion, place, which raise
My ravished thoughts, to hear his praise
Proclaimde, which heavens blessed hosts amaze,
by Notes of Angels airs.
104
O harmony! ^ranscending Art
Of which, the hopes, ease present smart:
Thrice happy they who bear a part
in this celestial Quire.
O blessed Musicians, most expert,
Whose Ditties, all delight impart,
Whose hymns exhilarate the heart
and entertain the Ear.
105
Of Ambrosie, of Nictar streams,
(Heavens dainties lid in heathnish names)
An endless feast the Lamb proclaims
to all the Saints above.
The Saints refresht nore with his beams
Then wordlings withvaine pleasures dreams,
O how desiderable se^nes
to Thine, this feast of Love.
106
Jf beggars vile themselve hold graced,
At Tables of great Kings to feast,
With curious cates to please their taste
with choice of rarest thngs:
Oh! what a heavenly sweet repast
Do Saints enjoy, which a^e shall last,
Who at immortal Tables placed,
feast with the King of Kings.
107
Of all these Millions which frequent
This Paradise of sweet content
Perfumes most rare refresh the sent,
from a perpetual spring.
Comforting Ointments odours vent,
Sweetning the heavens transpar^nt tent,
Which flow from him his blood who spent
His, to this bless to bring.
108
Which, (as in smell, taste, hearing, sight)
Jn feeling als enjoy delight,
The Body changde, spiritual, light,
apt every way to move,
Nimble, as thought, to reach by flight,
(Unwearied) heavens supremest hight
The Center low, from Zenith bright,
as It, the Mind does move.
109
By Motion swift, here, Bodies tossed,
If thus endangered to be lost,
The feeling sense, affected most
participats most pain:
What Joys (to view this numbrous host)
The Elementar regions, crossed,
When both vnharm'd through heavens may post
shall then this sense sustain?
110
If Spasmes, if Palsies, pincing throes,
Of Colic pains, invade, (healths foes)
These torments, Feeling, undergoes
most sensible of grief.
Now when sequestered from those woes,
Which mar life's vnsecure repose,
How shall this sense, set free, rejoyse,
exult, at its relief?
111
But even as one (more bold than wise)
A Pilgrimage does enterprise,
Over Atlas tops, which hid in skies* crownde are with Winter glass:
Hudge Mountains past, while he espyes
Jmpenetrable Rocks, arise,
Forced to retire, his course applies by smoother paths to pass.
112
So, while above the Spheres J prease,
Steps, not by Nature reached, to trace,
The clouds to climb with halting pace lets infinite impeach.
Those reachlesse Joys, this boundless peace
Jn number, measure, weight, increase:
That scarce begun, my Song must cease, these hights transcend my reach.
(...)
Fancies Farewell.
SON 1.
TOo long my Muse (ah) thou too long did toil,
An Ethiopian striving to make white:
^ost seed on surrowes of a fruitless foil,
Which does thy trauells, but with Tares acquit.
^ence-foorth farewell, all counterfeit delight,
^linde Dwarfling, J disclaim thy deity,
^y Pen, thy Trophies never more shall write:
Nor after shall thine arts enveigle me.
With sacred strains, reaching a higher key,
My Thoughts above thy fictions far aspire:
Mounted on wings of immortality,
^ feel my breast warmde with a wountlesse fire.
My Muse a strange Enthusiasme inspires,
And piece and piece thy flamme, in smoke expires.
SON. 2.
Hours mis-employ'd, evanisht as a dream,
My lapse from virtue, and recourse to Ill,
I should, I would, J dare not say, I will
By due repentance and remorse redeem.
Loves false delight, and beauties blazing beam
Too long benighted have my dazzled Eyes,
By youth misled, I too too much did prise
Deceaving shads, toys worthy no esteame.
Plungde in the tide of that impetuous stream,
Where fynest wits have frequent naufrage made,
O heavenly Pilote, I implore thine aid,
Rescue my soul, in danger most extreme:
Conduct me to thy Mercyes Port, J pray,
Save Lord, Oh, let me not be cast away.
SONNET 3.
Look home, my Soul, defer not to repent,
Time ever runs: in floath, great dangers ly:
Impostumde soars the patient most torment,
While wounds are green, the salve with speed apply
Works once adjourned, good success seldom try,
Delay's attended still with discontent:
Thrice happy he, takes time ere time slide by
And does by foresight after-wit prevent.
Look on thy labors: timouslie lament,
Trees are hewde down unwholesome fruits bring forth
Thy younger years, youths sweet Aprile misspent
Strive to redeem, with works of greater worth.
Look home J say, make haste: O shun delay,
Hoyse sail, while tide does last: Time posts away
FINIS.
