A pronostication for the year of our LORD GOD M. CCCCC. xliiii

Practysed by the right expert Doctor in Astronomy and phisycke Master
Cornelys Scute resydent in Bridges in the wolf street.

To the Reder.
BEfore I begin to come to my principal Pronosticatio^ of this year I have
taken in hand first to rebuke the proheme of a certain Pronosticatio^ in the
year of our lord a thousand five hundredth xliii. last past / made by one
master Henry swart / of Asperne: which did his uttermost to make the people
believe that the science of Astronomye is nothing worth / but evil: and the
same is also a great hyndraunce to the health of man's body / and that some
Phisytions do ascribe the cause of sycnesses (against all reason) to come by
the heavens / Stars / Planetes / Eclipses and Comettes. and cet. Saying /
that if so be that this deuelisshe co^nyng had not ben taken up / many one
should yet have lived longer. Co^maundyng by his Pronostication to all
Physicians / that they should leave this connyng of Astronomye / alonely to
practyse the right books of surgery. And also more injury has he done against
this excellent co^nyng / which were to long here to express. Now to come to
every point before written only to testifye / that the same connyng of Astronomy
is nedefall / and principally for Phisytions to mynister by to them that have
need of it / for to help and cure the body of man. So it is of a truth / that
Hipocrates / whose auctorotye and excellency in surgery he can not deny by
reason / all this saying in the Greek tongue / now turned in to English: who
that shall give himself ^ing of the sickness shall be of vomytynge collar or
wamblynge of the mawe. All such like sycknes shall be apt to take all cold
congealed matters: for as much as the moon is not shadoed with any other good
Planetes / the man shall dye in the first quadra^t / that is to wit / when the moon shall come the third syne following: But if the moon be shadoed with any
good planets / than shall the man over comme it in the first quadrant: that is
to wit / with in. vii. or. viii. days after. Also Gallene says in the end of
the same book i^ this manner: that a good Phisytion ought to have ever in his
remembrance the science of Astronomy / and that with all his endeuer ought to
inquire the day and time when the sycknes began or what time the hurt or fall
/ or other such like chaunsed / and must look than after what sort the heuens
and stars stood at that time / consydring that here in this world chaunseth
nothing / but by the procurement of the heaven above.

Also the great learned man Hermes Termegiscus / speaks after this manner: A good
Phisytion which shall help a man by co^nyng / must behold the constitution
or inclination of heaven / with the stars / how they agree together. Also
Aristotle says / in the first book and second chapter. Also Auicen Doctrina.
i^. cap, vii, Secundum res celestes and res terrestres eueniu^t, ille uero que
res secuntur celestes, sunt sicut ea que stella^u^ causa accidunt, est enim
cu^multe ex stellis in uno coniungitur loco et coniungitur soli, et prouenit ex
hoc califactio multa. Item Abhomeron / Abinzoer / an excellent Phisytion says.
libro primo cap. vii. in epilepsia paroxismi: Fieri co^sueuerunt ex operatione
super celestium corporum que a deo uiuo and uero parfectionem and influentiam
habere and resipere sciuntur. To this he puts to thuetoritie of Arnoldus de
uilla noua and Rasys and other learned Phisytions / whose words here to declare
would be to long / remembryng also that here is wytnessed enough against the
contrary saying of the aforesaid master Henry: that the Science of Astronomy
is a godly conning and needful for Physicians to know.

Item where as the aforesaid M. Henry says / that the Pronostications say not
ever true / is made answer enough by Ptolome quin to ece^tenis enuntiato. And
also by Johan Pontanium in the coment there upon made / And also in prohemio
libri su^. ii. de rebus celestibus. it would be to long to rehearse word for
word in this little book. Item this M. Henry says in the same Prouosticatio^
(without discretion) of a child of. xii. years. slepyng naturally / going and
standing / that within two years had neither eten nor dro^ken / saying that
every one learned in that natural conning ought to apply them selves to make
a natural answer or reason there unto / the which he hoped to do before her
face: which is a strange understanding to give there unto a natural reason /
which is befall contrary against all nature / following the sentence of
Hipocrates in Aphoris. 14. where he says that it is against gods
commandment to give confydence to the pronostication: so say I that it is
true that we shall not believe it so faithfully as the word of god in the
gospel or by the prophets which can not lie in no wise / but must be eue^ as
they be spoken iuxta illud, Mat. xxiiii. but it may be lauful to give such
credence there unto as we give to phisycke and other. We none otherwise do
dispose than the natural signs do declare / beholdi^g that the works be
wondrous exceeding all judgments of nature. And ye shall understand that I
have not said this before mencyoned not in derisyon or to shame the aforesaid
master Henry / but alonly for his unlawful opinion that he had to argue upon
against thexellent connyng of Astronomy.

The Operation of the four Eclypses of this year.
WE shall have in this Lepe year / four Eclypses / that is to wit / three of
the moon and one of the son.

The first Echyppes of the Moon shall befall the tenth day of January at vi. of
the clock before none / which shall be of. xii. points and xlvi. mynutes / so
that the Moon shall abide hole darkened xli min. and shall continue her
Eclyppes three hours and xxviii. mi. The Moon shall be about the Northwest /
with hye exaltacion above the earth / in the mids of the Eclyppes / and shall
not as yet be all about light when it goes down. Mars / Jupiter and Saturnus
shall stand about the sonth southeast. Venus and Mercurius shall ascend in
the highest when the darkness of the Moon begins to vanysshe away: they
shall have for their ascendent / the first degree of capricorn in the mids of
heaven / in the xxvi. degree of libra. The Moon shall be in the.vii. house of heaven
/ and shall begin the operation of this Eclyppes about August / as Ptolome says.

The second Eclyppes.
THe second Eclyppes shall be of the Son / the.xxiiii. day of January at viii.
a clock xxiii. min. before none / and shallbe of (...). points / almost.
xvii. min, so that all the hole Son save a little shall be darkened. The Son
shall stand south southest with the moon / which shall stand right under the
Son / so that in our orisone if shall hinder and take away the brightness of
the Son: which Eclyppes and also other Eclypses before going we shall well and
parfytly se if that ye se the moon or the son. And if case be that through
darkness of the wether we should not se the son or the moon / yet the
Eclyppes shall be never the less if (...) should not se it. The Eclyppes shall
have before his ascendent the xii. degree of Aries. Venus shall be in the vi.
degree of capricorn right south / syttyng in the mids of heaven, Jupiter and
Saturnus shall be in the eight house about the southwest: all the seven planetes
shall as than be above ye earth / that is to wit / three in the eight house / two
in the tenthe house / and two in the xi. house / which shall be wonderful and of
great mystery. Out of these iiii. Eclipses shall be brought forth wonderful
matters / as we shall express here after. Mars shall be in the Eclyppes of the
Son in the house of death, in Scorpio. in propria domo, gaudio proprio. and
propria triplicitate. Jupiter shall be in proprio casu, between Saturn and Mars
/ in the eight house of death also.

* Here after follows the third Eclyppes of the Moon.
THe third Eclyppes shall be of the moon / and shall be the fourth day of July
viii. a clock. xxi mi. after none / and shall be of xvii. points and xv. my.
so that the moon shall be hole dark i, hour and a half and shall endure longer
than the first and shall be almost hole darkened when it shall rise in the est:
so that it shall seem to be a wonderful matter. Saturnus and Jupiter shall sit
together in the south / and Mars beneth the southeast / Mercurius in the west
northwest. The ascendent shall be the viii. degree of aquatius. The Son shall be in
the viii. house. The operation of this shall begin incontynently after that the
Eclippes shall be passed / and shall fall very strong at that time.

A fourth Eclyppes.
THe fourth Eclyppes is of the Moon / and shall be the. xxix, day of December /
at. vi. a clock and. xx. mine. before noone / and shall be of xiiii. points.
xviii. mine. Than shall ye moon sit about ye northwest before the day / and
shall go down all black and darkened. The moon shall be an hole hour dark
and. iii mine. and shall endure from the beginning to the end three hours and
xxxvi. mynu. and shall have the self same asce^de^t Iunii. medium c^li. and
also occasu^ with gods / also the other houses of the heue^s shall be even as the
heuens were at the time of the other foresaid eclypsis / which shall be a
wondrous matter / as is well known to all astronomers. Jupiter and Marcurius
shall sit both southeast / in the xii. house about the earth. Saturn shall sit
in the south southeast / and so forth all the other planettes shall be under the
earth / the ascendent shall be the first degree of Capricornus / in the mids of
the heuens / in the rxvi, degree of Libra and so forth as it is in the foresaid
Eclipses

Of sycknesses that shall reygne this year.
PArusing the signs made upon the calculations of heuens / the times of the
four Eclipsis aforesaid / I find that this year shall be apt to great burning
and fervent sycknesses / of the which many people shall dye / yt that the
mercyfulnes of god do not help: It is to be doubted of great death. There shall
reygne much pain in the head / in the throat / in the sides / with burning
agues / and so forth. Those that has Scorpio / Pisces / or Cancer in the
mids of heuens with one aspect quadrant / or the opposition of Saturn or
Mars shall be this yrre sore vexed with sycknesses / commonly with the foresaid
triplicitye / or of such like humors or matters as the aforesaid triplicitye
is gyuynge and bringing forth.

Of all growing things
AL things that by the auctour of Mars and Venus are ascribed unto / and are
under their protection / shall prospere well this year / and increase to the
great auau^tage of the people. They may stand in ieopardye in the beginning
of Apryll / and in the end of March / but they shall prospere well again in
the buddynge time / but those that have Jupiter and Sol to their protector /
shall have much hynderau^ce in their buddyng / how be it there shall be succor
done from other quarters / so that they shall not be very dear.

Of the four ceasons of the year /
and first of Winter.
WHat time the four seasons of the year begin I have showed unto the people
enough in times past / so yt they ought now to know that them selves / wherefore
it is no need to speak more of that / but go unto the properties and
inclination of the four quarters of the year / than must I first make mention
of the Winter / which is intemperate / and than of the two Eclypsis / the one of
the Son / and the other of the Moon / which shall be in January next
coming very intemperate / with great tempests of wyndes / and shall be apt to
frost enough / during long / but not so sore as the last winter was.
Governors of lands / cytyes / and castles must than take good head / and
weapon them against treason / for there shall be many secretly conspyred / and
than shall reygne unreasonable sorts of sycknesses / and in some places
pestilens in general / with diverse others / Wherefore I will speak no more of
that.

Of the Lent season.
IN the Lent season shall there be much rumoure and news of wars. And there
shall as tha^ raygne many new diseases which shall be very hard for Phisytions
and Surgyons to cure. And it shall be in the beginning cold / with raynes
hayle and snow.

Of the Somer.
THe Somer begins the xi day of June at ten of the clock at night / and
shall have for his ascendent the tenth degree of Aquarius in the mids of
heuens. The first degree of Sagittarius and Jupiter shallbe in the nyenth house
/ and Mars in the leue^th / the Son in the fyfth house / and shall be after
her signification enclyned to great blood shedynge and also to great vexations
/ seditions and wars, also it seems that through thexpectation of Jupiter and
Mars with the sextile aspect / Spiritual persons / as the bishop of Rome and
other may well go about to make ^n appoyntement / but they shall no^ bring it
to pass nor to none effect / and also with great faruent and hot sicknesses
shall they be infected / which shall come of the inward parts with great fevers
and pains in the head and also pestilens

Of the Harvest.
The Harvest this year shall be somewhat warmer and dryer than it has been in
times past / in the beginning with much dew / in the end with much rain /
and shall be wyndy among / with a little rain. There shall than reygne many agues
and quarteyns / with pains in the heed / in some places with pestilens: of the
collycke shall many people be infected.

throughout all the world / principally in our realm here / with variaunce /
sedition / and open war / many men shall be spoiled and slain / houses /
castles / and cytyes shall be taken / brent and destroyed / the people shall be
without mercy or pytye. The countries being under the protection of Aries / as
France / England / and a part of Dutchelande / with hole Denmark / shall
have much to do. And I se not / nor I find not / after mine opinion / that
these wars and variaunces shall be appeased / how be it in the Eclippes of the
Moon the fourth day of July / Jupiter is lodged even about the mids of the
heuens / for Mars being in the clips of the Moon in January asited in the
tenth house in the highest seat of the heuens. Italye / Lumbardye / Pyemont /
Naples / Poullye / Calabre / Sicilie / Corphen / Sardayn Mynorq^ / Molto /
Matorq^ / Spain Portyngale / Hungary / Albanye / Poole / Boheme / and so forth
a great part of Asia and Af^rica / shall be all in trouble and war / we may well
trymble at the news that we shall here daily / as well of the Turks and
sarasyns as of the Christians A bodies hear of his head may sometime stand
vpryght for fear of these new tidings / which we shall daily here of. The
feats of war and the victory shall stand diverse times variable / so that in
one country there shall be cytyes and towns won / and in an other lost
again. Let us pray unto god earnestly / that he may fasten the princes hearts
/ and turn it to peace / contrary to there positions and influences of the
heuens.

Of Phillip the king of Spain.
PHillip the son of Charles king of Spain / who shall be of age in the year of
our lord god M. v. C. xliiii. xvii. years old / and he has in his revolution
this year the first degree of Pisces / for his ascendent is in the first house /
Lun^ in the fourth / Jupiter / Sol / Venus / and Marcurius / al in octaua, pars
fortune in nona, Saturnus in sexta, so that his figure this year is enclyned
to be almost as it was in his birth / after the influence of the planets /
which shall be a wonderful token / and shall be through Mars / being about the
ascendent / and he shall be this year very liberal to those that employ
themselves unto him in feats of weapons / and shall be himself wondrous
desirous to war / for to vaynquysh his fathers enemies / so that he through
the gift of fortune shall be very strong / as well by the help and assistens of
the spiritualtye as of the temporaltye / and shall get great victory / and
conquer by war. Saturnus being in the sixth house thretneth his majesty
somewhat with sycknes of his body ex humoribus crassis, and also calcuiosis ex
materia viscida, wherefore he must take good head of him self / and that with
good aduysement the more because that Sol and Jupiter are in the eight house.

Of thr Emperors majesty.
CHarles the fyfthe Emperor of Rome / after the figure of his revolution of
this year. M. v. hundredth and. xliiii. shall have for his ascendent the xi.
degree of Leo / and in the mids of heuens Aries domu^ Martis cum casum
Saturnus which at the time of his birth had a lucky figure of the heue^s / so
that Jupiter / Sol / Marcurius pars fortune and Venus were all in domo secunda,
which shall this year be so sore minded to war as ever he was in his life /
and shall through Aries being in the tenth house / be counseylled, aspectu
trino and sextile, of good planets / and they be therein very lucky / and shall
have great victory and prospere greatly, Neuerthe less / because that Mars is
in the fyfth house / and Saturnus and Jupiter in the fourth house / it is
greatly to be coniectured / that he shall have some great thing against him / so
that his mind shall be often troubled / but yet he shall overcome all at length
/ through Sol being Lord of thascendent / but not without great blood shedyng
of many men / because that the lord of thasce^dent is lodged in the viii. house
which is the house of death But through Venus being in the syxth house / there
might chance some inconuenyence of sycknesse unto him / how be it / it shall
notte hinder him. And also he shall be in many feats of war victoriouse / and
shall be feared sore of his enemies / which shall bear unto him secretly a good
heart.

Of the king of Englandes Majesty.
HEnry the eight / king of England / who was.lii. years old in the month of
June last past / having in his revolution of this year Saturnus in the
Ascendent of Virgo / in the mids of heaven. And his majesty shall bear him
self wisely this year in all his affairs / and shall be also lucky in his
setting for the through the excellency of Fortune being in the mids of the
heue^s with Iuppiter and Venus in the ix, house: wherefore he shall triumph in
money and gifts being very lyberall. It shall be good to serve him this year /
by cause that Mercurius is lord of the mids of heuens. In wars he shall
also prospere and have great fortune / because that Luna is in the viii. house
/ well infourmed aspectu sextill of other good Planetes. His Realm shall
prospere in the feats of merchundyse / and be fortunate. And he shall have more
honor this year / than he has had in many years past with special love of his
subjects. And shall be in the lent very earnest for some causes that has been
long in his here for to bring it to a good end / effect and purpose.

Of the French King,
FRauncys / the French kig and first of that name / who is in the month of
September next coming. l. years old. After the revolution of this year he
shall oftentimes be heavy of chere / and shall have great loss in his dominion
/ and shall have but little good luck in the feats of war. Some of his
gentylles shall secretly depart from him / he shall do his uttermost by one
third person to entreat for peace / but it shall not prevail / his country
shall be sore vexed every where / he is also inclined to fall in to a great
sycknes and dredefull / Mars fortunate is to him lodged in an vnfortunable
house / having very evil aspectes in his ascendent and in the mids of the
heue^s / wherefore he has need to look wisely about him and his subjects. In
his own parsone he will come to the field / but he shall bear away little
honor or luck.

Finis.
Thus ends the Pronostication for the year of our lord a M. v. C. xliiii and
here after follows an Aduartysement of Phisycke
An aduertysement.
PTolome says in the C. xx. conclusyons / on this wise Enterprise not with
iern to open any membre when the Moon is in any Sign that has dominion of
that membre: By the which words / the Philosopher will have us to observe the
course of the Moon in pourgynge of the bodies / because that the operation of
the moon is to moysten the bodies, This is parceyued effectually in the grieved
membre that is subject unto the Sign where in the moon is upon any day / where
by it follows / that it is not lefull to open that membre / as long as the
Moon is in that Sign F. ii.

The nature of the twelve heavenly Signs.
The xii. heavenly Signs workyng in us / are like unto four elements.

These in workyng are hot dry / fyrye and coloricke
Aries Leo Sagittarius


These in workyng ar cold dry / earthy and melancolycke.
Taurus Uirgo Capricornus


These in workyng are moist ^yerly and sanguyne.
Gemini Libra Aquarius


These in workyng at moist watery / fl^ma^.
Cancer Scorpio Pisces


These signs does the Moon over run all within the space of xxvii. days
and the third part of a day / but some ouerconneth them in the space of a year
/ that is in. C. C C xlv. days and a quarter of a day

It is to be noted also that a day contains four and twenty hours and the
hour xl, mynutes.

Of Phlebotony or blood lettinge
In lettynge of blood are these three to be observed / namely the co^uenyent
signs where in the moon is / the complexion and the age of a man. The signs
conuenyent for the sanguynes are: Taurus / Virgo and Capricornus. For the
colerycke / Cancer / Scorpio and Pisces For the melancolycke / Libra and
Aquarius. For the flegmarycke: Aries and Sagittarius. Leo is an evil Sign to
let blood in. Furthermore / Age is to be consydred also (...) quarter of the Moon is apt for young age / the second for myddle age / the third and fourth
for old age.

An observation for Phisycke.
When the Moon is in signs that be hot / than is the power attractyue by
heat and drought / when it is in erthy / than is the power attractyue: when it
is in ayrie signs than is the power digestyue.
