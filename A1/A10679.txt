The Book of Nurtur for men servants, and children, with Staus puer ad
mensam, newelye corrected, very vtyle and necessary unto all youth.
THERE is few things to be v^derstande more necessary, then to teach and
govern children in learning and good man^r. For it is a high service to god,
it increases favor, it multiplyeth goods, and increases thy good name, it
increases prai^r, and by prayer grace, and to use children in v^rtue and good
learning. The cause of the world being so evil in living, as it is, is for
lack of virtue in youth. Which youth shows the disposicid of their parents
or masters, under whom they have been governed. For youth is disposed to
take such as they are ac^ustomed in, good or evil. For if the conversation of
the governor be evil: needs must the child be evil. And thus by the
child ye shall perceive the dysposycion of the gouernoure. For of evil
examples many dangers and abominable sins follows. For the which both
the disciple and the master shall suffer, and does daily. It is also
necessary for a governor to use them in fair speech, and set to well their
words with good aduysement without stamerynge. And if ye put them to schole
away from you, see ye put them to a dyscrete master that can punisshe
sharpelye with pacienc^ and no^ with rigor, for it does often times make them to
rebel and run away. Whereof chau^seth often times much harm. Also their parents
must often times instruct them of god, and of his laws, and virtuous
instructions of his word* and other good examples, and such like. And thus
by little and little they shall come to the knowledge of reason, faith, and good
christen living. For as S Paul says unto Timothy. He that does not regard
the cure and charge of them that are under the charge of ^is governance, he
denies the faith, and is worse th^n a Pagan. And take good head of any new
servants that you take into your house, and how ye put them in authority
among your children: and take heed how they spend that is given them. Also
apose your servants of their belief, and also if they bring any thing home
that is miss taken, or tell tales or news of detraction, ye shall than
reprove them sharply, if they will not learn, avoid them out of your house:
for it is great quietness to have people of good fa^ion in a house. Apparel
not your children or servants that are of lawful discretion in sumtuous
apparel: for it increases pride and ob^tinacie, and many other evils often
times. Nor let your children go whether they will but know where they go, in
what company, and what they have done, good or evil. Take heed they speak no
words of vilany, for it causes much corruption to engender in the^, nor show
them much carnal love: and s^ that they use honest sportes and games* Mark well
what vice they are specially inclined unto (break it be times) and often times
use them to hear the word of god preached, and then enquire of them what they
hard preached, and use them not to read fained fables, or vain fantacies, of
folysh love it is time lost. For if thou learn pure and clean doctrine in
youth, thou shall power out plenty of good and pure waters in thine age: and if
any strife or debate be among them at night, charitably call the^ to gether, and
with words or stripes make the^ al to agree in one. Take heed if thy servant
or child murmr or grudge against thee, break it be time. And when thou
hear the^ swear or curse, lie or fight: thou shall reprove them sharply.
And ye that are friends or kin, shall labor how to mak^ them to love and dread
you, as well for love as for fear.

The manner of serving a knight, squier, or gentleman.
First ye must be dilligent to know your masters pleasure, and to know the
order and custom of his house. For diverse masters are of su^drie co^dicions
and apetites. And if thou be admytted in any office, as buttrie or pantrie, in
some places they are both one: take an inuitory of such things as ye take
charge of, how it is spent. For it pleases a master much to have a true
rekenyng: then in your office of the pantry, se that your br^ad be chipped and
squared* and note how much ye spend in one day. And se your na^ry clean^, and
^ort every ^hynge by it self, the clean from the foul, ke^^ every house of
office cl^ne, and all that (...): when your master will go to his (...) about
your neck, then take a cup (...), and a towel, to array your cupbord (...),
set on bread, salt, and trenchers, the salt (...) tre^chers before the salt:
set your napkins (...) cupbord ready, and lay every man a trench^^ (...), and
a spone: and if ye have mo meases then (...) masters table, considre what
degree they be of, (...) after ye may serve them: and then set down every
th^n^^ at that mease as before, except your keruing knives: ^f ^^ere be many
gentlemen or yomen, then set on bread (...) ^renchers, spones after they be
set, or else after the cul^^^ ^f the house. And some do use to set before every
man a lofe of bread and his cup, and some use the contrary thus must yo^ have
respect to the order of the house, and in some places it is used to set
drink, and a lofe or two. In some places the ker^er does use to show and set
down and goth before the course and bears no dish, and in some place, he
bears the first dish, and makes obeysaunce to his master, and sets it
down covered before the degree of a knight, or else not used, and take the
couers and se^ the^ by. Also the karuer has authority to karue to all at his
masters mease, and also unto other that sit io^ninge by them if he list, see
ye have voyders ready for to auo^de the morsels that they do leave on their
trenchers. Then with your trenchour knife take of such fragmentes, and put it
in your voyder, and set them clean a gain. Al your sovereigns trench^urs, or
bread, void them once or twice, specially when they are wet, or give them
clean. And as ye se men leave eating of the fy^st and second dishe so avoid
them from the table. And than if that so be ye have any more courses than one
or two, ye may make the more have in voyding, and ever let one dishe or two
stand til the next course, and than take up al, and set down fresh and clean
voyders withal, and let them not be to full or ye empty them and then set
clean again, and look what sause is ordained for any meat, void the sause
thereof when ye take a way the meat. And at the degree of a knight ye may set
down your cup cou^red, and lift of the cover, and set it on a gain, and when
he lysteth to drink and takes of the cou^r, take the cover in thy hand and
set it on again, when he has dronken look the cup of wine or ale be not
empt^e, but often renewed. Also the karuer shall break his dishe before his
master, or at a sidecupbourde, with clean knives, and se there lack not
bread nor drink, and when men have well eaten, and do ^egin to wax weary of
eating, or if ye perceive by the countenance of your master when ye shall take
up the mea^, and void the table, begin at the lowest mease, take away your
spones, if there be any how be it ye may avoid the^, after brothes and baked
meats are past. Then take away your ^o^ders and your dyshes of meat as they
were se^ down, so take t^em up in order. Then se^ down ^hese or (...), and
that ended void your chese and frui^es and cover your cup, al^ or wine, first
vo^de the ale, and then the wine, then set on a broad voyder and put therein the
small pieces of bread and small cromes, with trenchers and napkyns, and with
your trencher knife or napkin make clean the table, then set away your bread
hole, and also your voyder, then take up the salt and make ob^^saunce, mark
if your master use to wash at the ta^le or standing, if he be at the table,
cast a clean towell on your table cloth, and set down your basyn and ewer
before your sovereign, and take the ewer in your hand, and give them water.
Then void your basin and ewer, and fold the board cloth together with your
towelll therein, and so take the^ of the board. And when your sovereign shall was
she set your towel on the left hand of him, and the water before your
sovereign at dinner or supper, if it be to bedwarde, set up your basin and
your towel on the cupbord again. And if your master will have any conceytes
after dynner, as apples nuttes, or cream, then lay forth a towel on the board
an^ set thereon a lofe or two, see ye have trenchers and sp^nes in a redynes if
need require, then serve forth your master well, and so take it up again with
a voyder.

How to order your masters chamber, at night to bedwarde.
Array your cupbord with a cupborde cloth with your basin, ewer, candell light,
and towell, if ye have help, ser one to bear a torche or some other light
before, and another follow to bea^e a towell and bread for your table as thou
see need. And if you have banquet disshes what soever it be, as fruits put in
sundry disshes and all other confections and conceytes of spicerye, also when
the di^hes are emp^ie avoid them from the table: if your sovereign be a
knight or squier, set down your dishes covered and your cup also. And if your
sovereign be not set at the table let your dishes stand covered til he be set,
and when he is set, then take the voyders. When your master entendeth to
bedward, se that ye have fire and candle sufficient, ye must have clean water
at night and in the morning, if your master ly in fresh shetes, dry of the
moistenes at the fire, if he ly in a strange place se his shetes be clean,
then fold down his bed, and warm his night kercher, and se his house of
office be clean, help of his clothinge, and draw the cortins, make sure the
fire and candle, avoid the dogs, shut the doors. And at night or in the
morning, your master being alone, if ye have anything to say, it is good
knowing his pleasure: in the morning if it be cold make a fire and have in
clean water, and bring him his peticoat warm with his doublet and al his
aparel clean brusht, and his shows made clean, and help to array him, trusse
his points strike up his hosen, and see al thing clenly about him, give him
good attendaunce and especially among strangers, for attendaunce does please
masters very well. Thus doing with dillygence god will prefer you to honor
and good fortune.

Here follows the book of nurture of good manners for man and child.
AL ye that would learn, and would be called wise
Obedience learn in youth, in age it will avo^d vice
I am blind in Poets art, thereof I can no skyl
Al eloquence I put a part, follow mine own will
Corrupt in speech my breues and longes to know
Borne and bred in Deuonshyre, my terms will well show,
Take the best, leave the worst, of truth I mean no ill
The matter not curious, but thentent good, mark it well
Pardon I ask, if I offend, thus boldly to write
To master, servant, young or old, I do me submit
Reforming both youth and age, if any do amiss
To you I show my mind, amend where need is
Set your young people, good manners for to learn.
To your elders be gentell, do nor say no harm
If youth do evil, their parents are reported sone
They should teach other good, by like them selves can none
A good father, makes good children, grace being the^ within
For as they be used in youth, in age they will begin
He that lack^th good manners is little set by,
Without virtuous conditions, a man is not worth a fly,
Reverence thy parents, so duty does the bind
Such children increase in virtue by kind,
Against thy parents multiplye no words, be ye sure,
It will be to the a praise, and to thy fr^ndes pleasure,
A plant without moisture, can bring forth no flower
If in youth ye want virtue, in age you shall lack honor
Dread, god, fly sin, earthly things are mortal
Be not hye minded, for pride will have a fall
Rise early in the morning, for it has properties three
Holiness, health, and wealth, as my father taught me,
At six a clock at the fatthest, use for to rise
Forget not then to bless the once or twyse,
Every morny^ge use some devotion, let for no need,
All the day after, the better thou shall speed,
Or thou thy chamber pass, purge thy nose cl^ane.
And other filthy things, you know what I mean
Brushe and sponge the clothes, that thou shall wear
Cast up your bed, lose noue of your g^a^e
Make clean your shoes, comb your head, and you enbrace
Se thou forget not to wash thy hands and face.
Put on thy clothing for thy degree, hones^ly do it make
Bid your fellow good morrow, or ye your way forth take
To your friends, and to father and mother, look ye take heed
F^r any have, do them reverence, the better shall thou speed
Dread the cursing offather and mother, for it is a heavy thing
Do thy duty to them, for the contrary is thy dyspraysing
When thy parents come in sight do to them reverence
Ask the^ blessing if they have been long out of thy presence
Cleanly apoint your array, beware than of disdain
Than be gentell of speech, and manerly you retain
As ye pass by town or street, sadly go forth your way
Gase, ^e scoff^, nor scold, with man, n^ child make no fray
Fair spech does great pleasure, seems of a gentle blood
Gentle is to use fair spech, it requires nothing but good
When thou come into the church, thy prayers for to say
Kn^le, sit, stand, or walk, devoutly look thou do pray
Cast not your eye to and fro, althinges for to se
Else shall thou be judged plainly, a want^n for to be
When thou art in church, do churchly warkes
Communication use thou not to women, priests ne clerks
When your devotion is done, a time is toward dinner
Draw home to your masters presence, there do your deuer
^f ye be desired to serve or sit, or eat meat at the table
Enclin to good manners, and to nurture your self in able
And your sovereign call you, with him to dine or suppe
Give him reverence to begin, of meat and cup
And beware for any thing, prese not thy self to hie
To s^t in the place, appointed thee, that is courtesy
And when thou art set, and table covered the before
^are not thy nails, file not your cloth, learn that lore
And thy master speak to thee, take thy cap in thy hand
If thou sit at meat when he talks to the, se thou stand
Lean not to the one side, when thou speak for nothing
Hold still hand and foot, and beware of triflinge.
Stand sadly in tellinge thy tale, when as thou talkest
Trifle with nothing, and stand upright when thou speak
Twhart not with thy fellow, nor speak with hye voice,
Point not thy tale with thy finger, use no such toys,
Have audience when thou speak, speak with authority
Else if thou speak wisdom, little will it avail thee
Pronounce thy speech with a pause, mark well thy word
It is good hearing a child, beware with who^ ye bourde
Talk not to thy sovereign no time when he does drink
When he speaks give him audience, that is good I think
Before that you sit, se that your knyfe be bright
Your hands clean, your nails pared is a good sygh^.
When thou shall speak, roll not to fast thine eye,
Gase not to and fro as one that were void of curtesye,
For a man's countenance oftimes discloseth his thought
His look with his speech will judge him good or naught
And se your knife be sharp to cut your meat withal
So the more clenlyer cut your meat you shall
Or thou put much bread in thy potage, look thou it assay
Fill not thy spone to full lest, thou lose somewhat by the way
If men eat of your dishe cromme therein no bread
Least your hands be* sweatie there of take ye good head
They may be corrupt that causes it, is no fair usage
Of bread slice out fair morsels to put in your potage
Fill it not to full of bread, for it may be to thee reprouable
Lest thou leave part, then to measure thou art variable.
And sup not loud of thy potage, ^o time in all thy life
Dyp not thy meat in the saltseller, but take it with a knif^
When thou have eaten thy potage do as I shall the wish
Wipe clean thy spone, and leave it not in the dishe
Lay it down before thy trencher, thereof be not afraid
And take ^ede who takes it up, least it be conuayed.
Cut not the best morsel forthy self, leave part behind
Be not gredye of meat and drink, be liberal and kind
Burnishe no bones with thy teeth, for that is unseemly
Rent not thy meat a sondre, for to curte^y it is contrary
And a stranger sit nere the, ever among now and than
Reward him with some dainties, like a gentelman
If your fellow fit fro his meat, and can not come thereto
Then cut him such as thou have, that is gently do
Belke nere no man's face with a corrupt f^mosytie
Turn from such occasion, it is a ^^y^kynge ventositie
Eat small morsels of meat, not to great in quantity
If ye like such meats, yet follow not ever thy fantasy,
Corrupt not thy lips with eating, as a pigge in a draffe
Eat softly and drink manerly beware ye do not quaffe
Sc^atch not thy head or fingers when thou art at meat
Nor spit over the table bourd se thou do not forget
Pick not thy teeth with thy knife, nor finger end
But with a stick or some clean thing, tha^ do ye not offend
If your teeth be putrified, me think it is no right
To touch meat other should eat, is no cleanly sight
Pick not thy hands, nor play not with thy knife
Keep still foot and hand at meat time begin ye no strife
Wipe thy mouth when thou shall drink ale or wine
On thy napkin only, and se al thing be clean
Blow not your nose in the napkin, where ye wipe your hand
Cleanse it in your handkerchife, then pass ye not your hand
With your napkin ye may often wype your mouth clean
Some thing thereon will cleave that can not be seen
Fill not thy trenchour with morsels great and large
With much meat f^ll not thy mouth like a barge
Temper thy self with drink, so keep the from blame
It hu^teth thy hones^y, and hyndreth thy go^d name
A pint at a draught, to power in fast as one in haste
Four at a mease is three to many* in such I think waste
Use thy self from exc^sse, both in meat and drink
And ever keep temperaunce, if that ye wa^e or wink
Fill not thy mouth to full least thou must needs sp^ake
Nor blow not ou^ thy crommes when thou do eat
Foul not the place with spitting where thou do s^t
Lea^t it ab^or^e some to se it when thou have forget
If thou mus^ spyt or blow thy nose, keep it out of sight
Let it no^ lie in the ground, but tread it out right
With bones and void morsels, ^ill not thy trencher to full
Avoid them into a voyd^r, and no man will it anul
Roll not thy meat in thy mouth, that every man may it se
But eat thy meat somewhat close, for it is hones^ie
If thy soueraign profer the to drink ones, twice, or thrice
Take it gen^ly at his hand, for incourt it is the guise
When ^hou ha^t dronke set it down, or take it to his servant
Let not thy mais^er set it down, then is it well I warrant
Blow not in thy ^otage or drink, that is not commendable
For and thou ^e not (...) of body, thy breath is corupta^le
Cast (...) b^nes under the table, nor none do thou knacke
Stretche the not at the table, nor lean forth thy back
Before dinner or after with thy knife scorch not the bourde
Such toys are not comendable, tr^st me at a word
Lean not on the bourde when your ma^ster is thereat
For then will your sovereign think in you checkmate
Be not a^hamed to eat the meat, which is set before the
Manerl^ for to take it, that agrees well wi^h curtesye
Cast not thy eyes to and fro, as one that was full of toys
Much waggyng with the head, sem^th thou art not wise
Scratche not thy head, put not thy finger in thy mouth
Blow not thy nose nor look thereon, to some it is loath
Be not ^^ude where ye be, nor at the table where ye sit
Some men will ^^me the dronken, or mad, or to lack wit
When meat is taken away, and the voyders set in presence
Put your (...) ^n the voyder, and also the residence
Take with your (...) knife for^he cromes before the
Put your nap^yn in the voyder, for it is courtesy
Be gentell always and good to please, be it night or day
With tongue and hand be no regyous, let reason rule alwae
When the meat is take up, and the table cloth made clean
Than take heed of grace, and to wash your self demean
And while grace is saying, s^ you make no noise
Thank god of your fare, to your souera^gne give praise
When ye perceive to rise, say to your fellows all
Much good do it you gently, then gentlemen will you call
Then go to your sovereign, and give obeysaunce maner^y
And withdraw you aside, as best for your hones^ye
And ye se men in great c^unsell prease not to nere
They will say you are vn^aught, that is sure and ^l^are
Speak not much in thy fellows ere, give no ill language
Men are suspicious, and will think it no good usage
Laugh not to much at the table, nor at it make no game
Uoide slau^derous and baudy tales, use them not for shame
O^ thou be old beware, so thou ma^st get a sudden fall
And you be honest in youth, in age ye may be liberal.
For the waytyng servant.
IF ye will be a serving man, with attendaunce ye begin
First^ serve god, the^ the world, ever fle from syn
Ap^arell the after thy deg^e, youth ^hulde be clean by kind
Pride and dis^a^ne go before, and shame fastnes behind
Aquaint your self with honest m^n that are in authority
Of them may ye learn in youth, to avoid ^ll nece^sitie
Search thou must for friendship, and beware flaterie
With leude persons I the counsel, have no familiarity
Behold not thy self, in thy app^r^ll in church ne street
To ga^e on thy self, men will think it is not mete
Cry ne speak with loud^ voice, where as thou do walk
For of l^ght wit or dronke^ name be thou shall
Be not slothful for it i^ the gou^rnour of all vice
Nor be enuyous to the people for than ye be not wise
Pl^se friends delight not in sloth that vice wastes goods
It dulleth wits, tankleth flesh, and pa^^eth fresh blodes
If ye come to another man's house to sport and play
And the good man be at his meat, return and go your way
If fortune the advance and put the in h^e degree
Be liberal and gentel if thou will be ruled by me
To liberal nor skant, measure is best in every thing
To get in one year: and spend it in another, is no living
It is better to save somewhat, and keep it with good provision
Then to wish for that is spent, for it is evil division,
Measure thy expense, spend gladly, avoid excess
Enough is a feast, more then enough is folishn^s
A diligent servant taking pain for his master so,
No doubt his master will it consydre, and again for him do
A master will know where he is, and sometime for his pleasure
A servant to suffer in anger, to his maisteris a treasure
A servant not reformable, nor of reason will take no head
He falls into poverty, in wealth he may not long abide
Be manly at need, and begin no quarrel in wrong ne right
A just quarrel defends it self, in wrong do not fight
Forbear if thou may, if any will strike th^n take heed
Defend thy self, the law will acquit th^e at thy n^de
A man of his hands with has^ynes should not be fi^de
Uoide murder save thy self, play the man being co^pelde
Be seruiable cleanly, manly, and swear thou no oath,
Be wise, ^ea^ie, and well advised, for time tries troth
Thou do thy master no worship, to thy self no honeslye
Be not chekmate with thy mais^er, for a word give four
Such a servant continues not long, if he pas one hour
Few words in a servant, deseru^th commendacions
Such as be of much speech, be of evil operations
Be not to bold with men above thee in degree
In age, birth, or substance, lowlynes will do the honestye
Take pain in youth, ^louth is dulnes be atte^d^nt and wise
Be diligent, suffer a time, an evil servant is full of vice
Put not thy master to pain, with thy feigned subteltie
Wise m^n will say little, and suffer, to se thy iniquity
A man that says little, shall perceive by the speech of other
Be thou still, se, the more shall thou perceive in another
Govern thou thy tongue, and let thy words master the
If ye follow will, ye are like him that will not thrive perdie
Obstinacy is great folly, in them that should have reason
That will not know nor amend, their wits be so geson
In displeasure forbear thy fellow, la^^ all malice a part
Nor meddle not with such, as ye think to be overthwart
A hasty or wylful master, that often changes servant
And a servant fleting, lacks wit and honesty I the wara^t
Change not often service, for it betokens a servant light
He cares for no man, nor none for him in wrong ^e ^ight
A t^ndable servant stands in favor for his auau^tage
Promoted shall he be in office or fe, easilier to live in age,
Use honest pastime, talk or singe or some instrument use
Though they be thy betters, they will the not ^efuse
To prate in thy m^ysters presence, it is no humaniti^,
For your promocion resort to such asmay you auau^tage
Among ge^tilmen, for rewards, to ge^tilwome^ for marriage
Se your eye be indifferent among women that be fair
And tell the^ stories of love, and so to you they will repai^e
Such pastime sometime does many a man auaunce
In way of marriage and your good name it will enhaunce
Of worldly pleasure* it is a treasure for to say truth
To wed a gentle wife, of his bargain he never rueth
What is most trouble to man of all things l^uynge
A cursed wife sho^tneth his life, and brings on his e^ding
Women n^se and not wise* waketh men when they should sleep
Ly^e as a fether in the wether, of such I take no keep
Fulgenti^^ declare^h de nuptus in Cana galilee
The con^icions of men and women, a part I will show ye
He likes Christ to a good man the author of all verity,
To rul^ him self and althinges, to obey to man truly
He lykeneth a good woman to the mirour of ^umilitie
In the^ is roted pacyence where spring^th faith by charity
Faith and trust in good women, ^oth in deed and word
Loving god, obeying their husbands, clean at bed and lord
Likened women to ydols, taken for gods yet they were devils
Judge ye if women now be cor^upt with any such evils
Women to blame or defame, I will dispraise none
Say as ye list, women are ill to trust al thing^s but one
Fair and good are two qualities, scarc^ly in one body seen
Fairenes is sone seen, her pacie^nce and goodness is il to d^me
For to save yt a man would have is at large without a keeper
Who can stay that will away, or without restraint let her
Towed a woman that is both good, fair and wise,
Is to have enough for him self, and for her as much thrice
The best liyng with a woman, when she is young clean and light
when thou will feeble the body and head, and was^ the sight
Who is ill to please, whose heart and eye is insaciable?
An old man, and a young woman to satisfy is incurable
when wome^s wits are moved, of reason the^ take no head
To please the^ again must be for love, m^de, or dread,
Pride, covetous, and lechery, if thou will from them flee
From treasure, apparel, and fair women, with^raw thy eye
Be not to bold in word and deed, for it is but little honesty
In chamber with women, use not to much famil^aritie
Te^l them n^ught that will not bel^ue the a^ ^hy word
It appears by them their good will they man little aforde
Of women ye have hard part, whereby ye p^rceyue my mind
Few words to wise is best, thus I m^ke an end
I hold the wise and well taught, and lykely to be ioly
That can beware to se the care of anoth^r man's folly
Make y^ mirror of an honest (...), and mark how he does
Do thou l^ke to them, then do thou wisely fo^soth
It is better to be poor and honest, to live in rest and mirth,
Then be to richewith sorow^, and come noble of birthe
If thou will have health of body, evil diet eschew
To get a good name, evil company thou must not show
Evil airs corrupt ma^s body, evil company does the same
Uoide evil company, thereof comes honestye and good fame
Al birds do live by kind, that are like in fether
Good and bad, wild and tame, al kinds do draw together,
Great diversity is between pride and honesty, it is sone seen
Among wise, it is sone judged, and known what they been
By the^r condition or facion, al thing shows as it is
Iagged or ragged, proud or meke, wis^ men call it excess
Many have co^nynge and virtue, without governance
Woe worth reason ill used, for it lacks remembrance
Better is to speak little for profit, then much for pain
It is pleasure to spe^de and speak, but hard to call it again
Use not hasty ang^e, a wise man will take leisure
Custom of sudden malice, will one turn to displeasure
First think, then speak, and then do it with discr^tion
Give with good will, and avoid thy enemy with provision
Evil me^ take pain to bye hell, and all for wordely pleasure
Derer then good men bye heaven: in god is their treasure
Learn or ye be lend, follow the proved man's aduyce
thou shall perceive more by this gloss, the^ by the letter is
Be content with fair rebuke, and have thy fault in mind
The wiselier thou do, the better thou shall find
If thou be wise, consydre thy friend both in word and deed
And thank him that gives thee cloth, drink, and bread
Turn not thy race, like a churl, as void of all mekenes
To the^ that do the good, give thanks, and show ge^tilnes
Many covet much, and little pains therefore will take
If thou wylt a master please, from sloth thou must awake
One thing take heed, thy time spend not in vain
Time misspent, or (...) not be called again
Seek in youth, and thou shall find, to be one not untaught
Wise or folishe to rule, or be ruled, or to be set at naught,
Take pain in youth if thou will be called wise,
Or thou must take it in age, and be full of vice
K^pe measure in wealth, a time is to the lent
Better is to save, then to suffer when all is spent,
To remember before what will fall, it shall thy heart ease
Fortune does ebb and ^low, good for wit does men please
Live justly, do well, and have well, let men say what they list
Be sec^ete to thy self ever b^ware of had I will,
Better is a bi^d in hand, then inwode two or three
Leave not certain for vn^ertaine I advise thee
Take heed b^tyme, for time has no measure
Praise goodness, blame evil, love is a treasure,
Better is truth with poverty, then riches with shame
Couetise auoideth gentleness, l^chery good name.
Suffraunce aswageth ire, amendeth that is amiss
In little medlynge is rest, in a busye tongue none there is
Be not hastye in a matter, but mark well the end
Be not foe to thy self* though another the offend
Presume thou not to hie, lest it run the to blame
I^ trust is treason, be ruled by reason, flee shame
N^ maistry it is to get a friend, but for to k^pe him long
As to thy self, so do to thy friend among
Where thou art put in trust, be true in word and deed
In a little fal^hode is shame, in truth much mede
Brable not with thy neighbor, let him live in rest
For such oftentimes, bids them an evil feast,
Among fool^s there is much strife, disdayn, and debate
Wit^ wise men ever rest, and peace after a good rate,
T^e^e is never quiet, where angry folk dwell,
Ten is ^yne to many, their malice is so cruel,
She^ gentle^^s to thy servant, willing to amend
^^sdome wylleth to forbear, though he offend
In m^lyce he not vengeable as S. Mathewe does speak
Due correction is nedeful, blessed are the m^ke,
Chyde seldom, therein gentylnes is none:
Prove and then choose of two harms make one.
To forbear where thou may ou^r is gent^ye do
Malice toward thy friend makes him thy fo.
A good man does good it is very plain
If his deeds be contrary al he does is vain.
Correct not other an^ do thy self the sa^e
For it ge^tet^ th^e an eu^l n^me.
Find not fault in men of good p^rseueraunce,
Correct thy self of thy w^lful ignorance.
Control not your fellow fautes as ye were clear
To pleasure other while they ^yl be nea^e,
Do for other in p^osp^r^tie
And thou shall be done for in aduersitye.
if thou becom^ of a g^nt^^ or noble plant
Thy condition will show I thee warrant
Subdue the ill that will not good or^er abide
Beware of common grudges at every tide:
Conceive not in thy mind that thou can do al
Left when thou think thy self thou fall.
A high m^n^ed man thinks no body like him
At his h^ghe^t yet is he not worth a pyn.
Under thy governance do no man blame
Use gentle speech so get thee a good name*
An honest man will rebuke his fault himself a lone.
And perceive hy^ ^elf he has ill done.
Move no man that is angry, and full often
A spark kyndleth f^re if it be forsed to bren,
To thy fel^w have never disdain
if vnkyn^nes happen yet be fren^es again,
To forb^are in anger is a friendly leche
your rage past you will repent your ill speech.
A wonderful thy^g and easy to be done.
He that may be f^ee, and will not, take of him no charge
Disprayse not in absence, be not vengeable
For small faults, small correction is commendable
Refrain wrath and correct at leisure,
Utter malice sometime does great dysplesure.
Honest men have honest words early and late
With their betters, and play not check mate
At thy friends house by night or day,
When rekening is past, then go thy way.
When thou borowest, keep thy day, though it the pain
Thus may thou the sooner borow again
Keep promise and day then take no thought.
Or else it may be full derely bought
Some ever borowe, but never bring again,
Ever nedie s^yll putting their friends to pain.
Always begyng and ever borowing can not long endure,
Such do fail when they think them selfs most sure
It is g^eate heuines to man that has nothing to lose
More pain to them that has plenty, says the gloss,
If thou spend above thy degree thou shall slake
Ta^e head betime, and thou may sleep when other wake
Ab^u^ thy degree count not to maintain,
Sp^n^e not thy goods prodigaly in vain.
Look or thou leap, the more ease to take
If thou leap or thou look, wisdom is to late.
Good counsel in thy works does greatly please,
Comfortable to thy friends, to thy self ease.
Be not moved if thy friend till the plain
Malice of mind is quited again.
A man's wi^dom is proved when he is ill said unto,
Su^feringe is virtue, fools can not do so
When occasion is, seek profit, for it lasts not ever,
It comm^t^, and ^oeth as pleases the geuer,
If thou will speak with thy master, gently go and s^e*
I^ is against manner, he should come to thee,
Some are ever borowynge, refusyng no person or time,
Caryng^ for them selves and not for thine.
Use ge^^le con^icions give the poor of ^hy good
Part t^erof toward their living and food
S^ea^e truth gently is very good
^a^ned speech comes vylaynes blood
Mo ke no man what soever he be
For it is b^t small curtesye.
To dysprayse thine enemy is blame
Say w^ll th^rfore for shame
A still man is a castle, a man from woe
A bu^y t^nge often of his friend makes his fo.
A gentleman unstable is folly
Shameful life in any man is ungodly
A gentl^man should be merc^full b^ his nativity
Liberal and cu^teyfe and full ^f humanity.
Poor men faithful and obedyent in th^yr ^yuynge
Uoydeth rebell^on and blood sh^dynge
Keep grace and governance in thy mind
Wan^ on in youth, vice in age by kind
Boast not of thy riches for s^ueraygntie
Thy deeds will put the in aucthoryt^e.
To a stranger, show not thy mind
Some c^n no c^unsayle in byn^e
To vnkno^en me^, give no ^re^ence
Some will customablye lie but truth will out
To utter g^yefe does ease, as I hand say
And counsa^le do never bewraye
If o^^er record thy saying it may seem true
Utteraunce of counsel, makes some to r^e
Keep close ^^cret^s without good pro^acion,
For people vi f^ll (...) deception,
Take h^de how you br^ake your for flatterye.
To leave pleasure* keep silence, and follow reason,
For ^etter is to ^ule then be ruled,
Disdain not least your name be defiled.
Love v^rtue ^ate v^ce, time ^o not thou wast
S^end in measu^e such as thou have
Babble not much if thou wylt be called wise,
To speak ^uch is taken for vice.
A fool^ will teach b^t will not be taught
Contrary him an^ sets thee at naught,
Al men are known by the works they go a bout
A hon^st man's words be not to doubt.
Samp^ons strength and not reason with al
Ho death not a man from a fall.
M^n^ have skyl and lack that should go there to
S^m^ are in authorytie and little good do.
(...) cie no one man has, though he be of hye syence
One ^ath lea^ny^g another experyence.
Co^^ing w^t^ ^r^de, an o^^icer cruel i^ an he uy case
The poor man proud, the rich a thief lack grace.
A time for all thing to be merry or glad
Conning without grace is (...)
Put not young men in authorytie that are proud and light,
A mantrid in youth, his exp^ry^n^e is of might.
Many take to much pride in con^yng,
Than is he not worth a puddyng:
A fool^s d^spl^asure to wise men is profitable
His good will unsteadfast, his desire vn^ac^able.
Replye not a gaynst a ^roud man's tale much,
for h^ thinks him self none such.
B^tter it is to beat a proud man then to rebuke him*
They thynk their conceyt wise yet it is very thyn
S^tedfastnes will enhaunce thy name
Slow in good deeds is great shame
If thou pla^ and sport with one simple of birth
^se gentle pastime, men will commend your mirth
^eware of subtyl craft therein be not infect
^f evil be done where thou art, men will the suspect
^oast not of baudines, to have it know^n
^o well, for an evil name is soon blown
^ man cleanely ar^ayed ought cleanewordes to preach
^se words like apparel, be like in speech
^e not bold in your array, nor yet of your goods,
^ore worth is honesty, then gaye hoodes.
^o give reverence to thy elders be thou feign
^r they may have of the great disdane.
^eport no slander, ne she^e any flatery,
^t shows preuie malice, and is void of curtesye
^edle little, and thou ^halt find it ease,
^n least medlynge thou shall most please.
^duise what you speak, where, how, and when
^o be beloved is the property of a wise man
^hinke or ye speak, take good h^de atlest
^y thy speech men will perceive thee best
^reise not thy self, to have so^eraigntie
^ood deeds shall put them authority,
^t thine own conceit laughe not nor make game
^uoide slander and baudy tales for shame.
^aughe not to much, enough is a tr^asure
^uche laughinge men say lack^th n^rture
^o sad is not bent, the mean is advantage
^^rth for policy sometime, is w^sedom and no outrage
^r ye begin mark the end, and take good head
^ good forethought is a friend at need
^e not hasty thine answer to make
^east thou repent after, when it is to late.
^et or thou spend, then bid thy frynde good morrow
^a^e pain, and avoid sorrow.
^byrde in hand, is worth ten at large,
In all my life I could scant find one trustre
Find a friend, th^n prove him, that thou wylt trust to,
So shall thou know, what he will do.
If thou have a friend, change not for a new
The^ that trust bu^ them selves, for friends need not show
Here thy enemies tale to the end
Refuse not the rebuke o^ thy friend.
If thy friend come to thy house for love or amity
Put away sadness* and show familiarity,
Gifts received, ponder thy degree
A poor man's hearty reward is worth other three
Of whom thou receyuest, give somewhat again,
Emptye fystes, can ^ot hawks reclayme.
If a stranger sit thee nere, make him good chere
That he may report thy name far and nere
Retain a stranger after his degree
Another time: he may do as much for thee
Of secret matte^s speak not, if thou be sage,
Talk discretly and not outrage.
Hon^st men be content with such as they find
And take all things with a good mind
Command not in another ma^s house nor contend
So shall other the commend.
A man that is nothing l^berall
Comm^th not of gentl^n^s at all
Sit no^ in the hiest place, where the good man is present
G^ue him place, mark his manners with aduisement
Regard honesty where ever thou art bent
Or else some men will not be content
In sport and play with man and child
Be thou ever meke and mylde.
Suspecte no counsel, if it be not to the moved
For froward thoughts are often deceived*
If thou come to a man's house, knock^ or tho^ go (...),
Presume not to far, though he be of thy kyn
If ye be sent on message, know it sure throughout
Then may thou speak boldly without any doubt
Delight to read good books, ma^ke them well
Thereof comes knowledge, wi^dom, and counsel.
Here of this matter I make an end,
He that seeks wisdom, is his own friend
He that spends much, and gets naught
He that owes much and has naught
He that looks in his purse, and fyndeth noug^te.
^aye be sorye and say naught.
He that may and will not
He then that would shall not

He that would and cannot
May repent and sy^^e no^.
He that swears til no man trust him
He that lies till no man believe him,
He that b^roweth till no man will lend him
Let him go where no man knows him.
He that has a good master and can not keep him
He that has a good servant and not content with him
He that has such conditions that no man loves him
May well know, but few m^n will know him.
