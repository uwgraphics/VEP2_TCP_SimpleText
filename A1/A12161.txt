The Testimony of a true faith.
Question.

IT is the duty of a true Christian always to be ready 1. Pet. 3.15
to render an account of his faith, to the end it may appear, that he is not
Mat. 10.32 Romans 10.10
ashamed of Christ and his Doctrine. Let me therefore hear what thou can
say of the principal points of Christian Religion.

Answer.

There be three special parts thereof. the first is John. 17.3 2. Cor. 13.5
to know God and my self: the second is, John. 5.24
the means whereby my salvation is wrought: the third, Matthew. 6.9 and. 26.26
what helps God does further me withal unto life everlasting.

Question.

What say thou of the knowledge of God?

Answer.

The same is of two sorts: the one is universal, and known Romans 1.19 Psalm.
19.1
by the creation of heaven and earth, wherein God offers him self to be seen
and known of me, as the only fountain of all goodness, who alone Deuteronomy. 6.13
ought to be worshipped. For his Genes. 1.1 Act. 17.24
eternity appears in the making of the world, his Psalm. 36
goodness in preserving the same, his Psalm. 107 Act. 17.28 Psalm. 115.3
providence in the tokens which are seen and felt, Psalm. 115.3.
whereby what pleases his godly will comes to pass, and not by blind
fortune: his Psalm. 104.24
wisdom in ordering of the things created: his Romans 2.7.8.9.10.
ryghtuousnesse in delivering the godly, and punishing the wicked: his Ezec.
18.32
mercy in patiently forbearing sinners, and calling them to repentance. So that
what may be known of God, is manifest in the things created, which universal
knowledge takes away Romans 1.20.
al excuse from the ungodly, which worship not God aryght: but to me it is a
Psalm. 19.1.
ready way to bring me to the true worship of God.

The other knowledge is special, and only proper John. 17.3 Iere. 31.34
to the elect, whereby, through faith poured into my heart by the holy ghost, I
am assured that my salvation is wrought by Christ the Son of God, by whom
To. 8.16
I am made the child of God through grace, and heir with Christ of his
kingdom, which knowledge only comes of Luke 10.21
grace, and so is given to me, but it is restrained from the wicked, because of
their Mat. 13.14
sin and hardness of heart.

Question.

What say thou of the knowledge of thy self?

Answer.

By creation I was made in Adam, according to the Genes. 2.27 Ephesians. 4.24
Image of God (I mean not any bodily shape, for God is a John. 4.24
spirit, and without body (in true righteousness and holiness, that is to say, in all perfection and happiness of nature, both in right judgment, reason, will,
and strength. In which happy state, if Adam had continued, both I and al his
posterity had been blessed for ever.

Question.

How did thou fall from this grace?

Answer.

My fall appears, in that Gene. 3. toto Romans 5.12.13
Adam who had this blessing for me, through the intisement of the serpent brake
the commandment of God, in eating of the forbidden fruit, and by the same
deprived him self of his former happynes, and brought sin, death, hell, the
wrath of God, and all kind of miseries into the world, as just punishments for
his deserts. In which his sinful act, his pride, disobedience, lack of faith,
unthankfulness to his creator, light credit to the Devil appeared. In which
offense, both I and all his offspring are wrapped, in as much as in him we all
have sinned, for he had the blessing given, to keep or loose, for him and his.
Wherefore I, and al others descending of him, by him, and in him, have fallen
from grace, and are infected with his corruptions, Psalm. 51.5
conceived in sin, borne in eniquitie, and Ephesians. 2.3 Romans 3.2
by nature the children of wrath, and utterly undone, without the grace and
mercy of God.

Question.

How art thou restored to grace again?

Answer.

My restoration comes through Titus. 3.10 Ephesians. 2.4
the free mercy and favor of God, who after this my fall in Adam, raised both
him and me up again with the comfortable Genes. 3.15 and. 12.2. and 22.18
promise of a Saueour, who by his Romans 3.25 Colos. 1.22 2. Cor. 5.21
death should pacify the wrath of God, and bring me into his favor again:
Romans 5.19
by whose obedience I am made ryghtuous: which my regeneration comes thus to
me, whylest Matthew. 3.2 Luke 24.47
by the preaching of the Law I am brought to the feeling of my syns, and
raised up with the comfortable promises of the Gospel, received by faith. Act.
15.9 1. Cor. 3.16
My heart is lightened, purifyed, and governed by the holy Ghost: Ephesians. 4.24
my will and mind reformed, and the image of God renewed again in me.

Question.

Show me what be the means whereby thy salvation is wrought.

Answer.

The ordinary means commonly are two, that is to say, Luke 24.47 Romans 10.17
the word of God, and faith.

Question.

What is the word of God?

Answer.

It is those Canonical scriptures 2. Tim. 3.16
written by the spirit of God, 2. Pet. 1.2^
and commended to man both in the old and in the new Testament, wherein are
contained Deuteronomy. 4.2 and 12.32 Galat. 1.8 Luke 16.2^
all things necessary to salvation, according to the which, the Lord will have
all his religion measured, without either addyng or dimishing.

Question.

How can thou know the true Religion, in so many opinions of the same, as be
in the world?

Answer.

First, I try the religion taught me Act. 17.11 John. 5.39
by the word of God, and by his spirit given me to understand the same.
Secondly, 1. John. 4.1.^
I know this spirit to be a right spirit, because it confesses Christ to be
come in the flesh, that is to say, ascribes the whole work of my salvation
to him, and to no other thing. Thyrdly, Romans 3.31
I expound one place of Scripture, as it is not contrary to another. And thus
I try the truth, Ioh. 12.48
making the word of God to judge and determine what I ought to follow.

Question.

How is the word of God divided?

Answer.

Into the Matthew. 3.2 Luke 24.47
Law and Gospel.

Question.

What is the Law?

Answer.

It is the ten commandments of God, requiring of every one Deuteronomy. 27.26
most pure, perfect, and perpetual obedience, Leuit. 18.5 Romans 10.5 Math. 19.17
promisyng salvation to them which fulfill the same, threatening death and
damnation to the transgessours thereof.

Question.

Rehearse the same to me.

Answer.

1 Exodus 20
Thou shall have none other Gods but me.

2 Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image, nor the likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under
he earth: thou shall not bow down to them nor worship them, for I the Lord thy
God am a ielous god, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show mercy to
thousands, in them that love me and keep my commandments.

3 Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will
not hold him giltles that takes his name in vain.

4 Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day, six days shall thou labor
and do all that thou have to do, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God, in it thou shall do no manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor
thy daughter, thy man servant, and thy maid servant, thy cattle, and
stranger within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, wherefore the
Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.

5 Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land
which the Lord thy God gives thee.

6 Thou shall not kill.

7 Thou shall not commit adultry.

8 Thou shall not steal.

9 Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

10 Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy
neighbors wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor
any thing that is his.

Question.

What say thou of the first commandment?

Answer.

The Lord therein requires 1. Sa. 15.22 Deuteronomy. 10.12
true obedience to his word, the fear and love of his name, Ioh. 3.15.16
a sure faith and trust in his promises, Psalm. 50.15 and. 23
the right invocation upon his name, with thanks giving for his benefits,
whereby his true worship may be known aryght: which things as he does

the contempt and denial of his word, Romans 3.18

calling upon other creatures, and finally what soever polluteth his service,
or our consciences, in whose presence all our doings do appear.

Question.

What say thou of the second: Thou shall not make? etc.

Answer.

God does therein declare how he will be worshipped, for seeing that his true
worship Deuteronomy. 6.13 Romans 14.23 Matthew. 5.16
is a work or service commanded in his word, proceeding of faith, and
tending to his glory: as he is a John. 4.24
spirit, so will he be worshipped in spirit and truth, without Leuit. 18.3
any myxture of Idolatry or superstition. Deuteronomy. 7.25 and 12.2. and 14.3
And therefore he forbids Deuteronomy. 4.23 Esaias. 40.18
the making of Images, to express him by Exodus 34.14 Psalm. 97.7
all manner devotion or reverence giving to the^, either in looking at them, or
in bowing the knee before them in prayer: for he is the Lord our God, and will
not have his power to be contemned: Exodus 34.14 1. Cor. 11.2
he is ielous over us, and will not suffer either our souls or bodies to be
defiled with any filthiness of Idolatry, which if we do, he will revenge the
same to the third and fourth generation. Briefly, he forbids hereby Deuteronomy.
12.2
all representations and tokens of Idolatry, Esaias. 29.13
al strange worship devised by man, Apoc. 13.15 and.14.9 and.18.4
all Antichristian Decrees, and whatsoever corrupts the true service, and
spiritual worship of God.

Question.

What is commanded in the third: Thou shall not take? etc.

Answer.

Herein the Lord commands a reverend use of his Name, Deuteronomy. 6.13
truly to swear and testify the truth, not Iere. 4.1.2
only in truth, judgment, and righteousness, but also Joshua. 2.12 2. Cor. 1.23
for necessities sake, especially when the glory of God, and the salvation of
our brethren is sought: requiring also herein a faithful zeal and Deuteronomy. 6.5
Acts. 2.42
love toward his word and Sacraments, and what soever 1. Cor. 10.^1
may set forth his glory, forbidding Deuteronomy. 28.58

Answer.

The Lord commands not only 1. Cor. 6.15 1. These. 4.4
perfect chastity both in soul and body, whether it be in marriage or in

covetousness, usury, oppression, bying and selling with false measures, 2.
These. 3.10

the same is stealing.

Question.

Show the sense and meaning of the Ninth, Thou shall not bear false witness.
etc.

flourish, to save our neighbors harmles, Deuteronomy. 1.16 1. Sam. 10.1
forbidding wrong judgment, or any respect of persons therein, the making of
wicked Laws and decrees, also Deuteronomy. 19.16 Ephesians. 4.25 1. Cor. 13. toto
false witness, and lying tales, flattery, suspicions, false accusations, and
what so ever empayreth the good name of our brethren.

Question.

What say thou of the last, Thou shall not covet?

Answer.

In this the Lord commands Deuteronomy. 6.5 Math. 22.37 Luke 10.27
the whole heart to be possessed with love, that what soever man does wish or
desire, it may be free from lust and corrupt affection, and serve to the glory
of God, and profit of his neighbors, forbidding hereby Genes. 6.^ Math. 5.28
Romans 6.12
al wicked thoughts and unlawful desires both of soul and body, although our
consent be not thereto, Ephesians. 4.22
al corruption of original sin by Adam, al lack of grace, and what soever
wants of the integrity and perfection wherein man was made. By all which
precepts, it may appear, that Job. 15.14 Deuteronomy. 27.26 Leuit. 18.5 Luke 17.10
nothing but true righteousness and innocence can please God.

Question.

By this I understand, that thou art not able of thy self, Romans 8.3
because of thy sins, to fulfill these laws, why therefore did God command
that, which thou can not do?

Answer.

First, hereby he declares how that his Image in me, Ephesians. 4.23 24.
is corrupted with sin, for nothing is here required, which I could not have
done before my fall in Adam. Secondly Deuteronomy. 27.26
here is nothing commanded which I am not bound to do. Thirdly, Deuteronomy. 6.25
he does not respect what I of my self cand do, but what his justice does
require. Last of al it sets forth the Romans 4.15 and.7.7
wrath of God, and brings me to the feelyng of my sins.

Question.

Why God is mercyful to thousands, and will not surely punish sin so sharply
as thou think.

Answer.

Exo. 20.6
God in deed is merciful to them that love him, and truly repent, but he is a
Psalm. 7.69 and.11.7. Deuteronomy. 32.35.
just Judge, and a God of vengeance to punish the wickedness of the ungodly,
which break his commandments.

Question.

By this I gather, that many are in a woeful case.

Answer.

Concerning the wicked, which be void of faith, and of the mercy of God, 1.
Ti. 1.9. Deuteronomy. 27.26.
the curse of the law hangs upon them. But touching the elect, of which
company I am persuaded that I am one: John. 3.16. 2. Cor. 5.21. Romans 3.25
Jesus Christ the son of God, in mine own nature has suffered to deliver me
from sin and the punishments thereof, and has brought me into the favor of
God again, of which benefit I lay hold Romans 1.16. Act. 15.11
with a true faith, Romans 10.17
which comes by the preaching of the Gospel.

Question.

What is the Gospel?

Answer.

It is the Romans 10.8.
doctrine of faith, Mat. 11.28 John. 5.24
conteynyng the promises of God unto salvation, Luke 24.47 John. 3.15 and 6.47
to all which truly repent, and lay hold of Christ's merits by a sure trust
in the same.

Question.

What do the promises of the Gospel mean?

Answer.

First they teach me that the law of God is fulfilled for me, by Christ, Romans
5.19 Ephe. 2.15 Galat. 3.13
by whom I have my sins forgiven, and with 1. Cor. 1.30. 2. Cor. 5.21
whose ryghtuousnes I am clothed, and may now boldly stand before the judgment
seat of God. Secondly, that my salvation Romans 3.24 and 4.5.16
comes only of the free mercy of God, without my merits or good deeds.
Thirdly Mat. 22.14 2. Cor. 4.6
although they be offered to all, yet they take effect in none to salvation, but
only in the elect, whose hearts God lighteneth with faith.

Question.

Show me what faith is.

Answer.

There is a kind of faith, called James. 2.14 Acts. 8.13
a dead faith, believing the word of God to be true, and al things therein
contained, and goes no further: but the true faith is John. 17.3
the fair knowledge of the fatherly good will and mercy of God showed toward
man in Christ, and Ephesians. 3.17
a sure trust in the same, which Romans 6. toto
in due time brings forth the fruits of good living.

Question.

What do thou learn hereby?

Answer.

First I learn to know God, who is made Romans 8.16
my father by Christ, through adoption and grace.

2 Secondly, Galat. 2.20
I apply to my self by this my faith, all the merits of Christ as fully as if I
had done the same my self.

3 Thirdly, Romans 4.19 Hebr. 4.16 and. 10.22
I have a sure trust in his merits and mercy, and boldness to offer up my
prayers to God the father by him.

4 Last of all I know his promises to Hebr. 11.1
be faithful and true, and that he will perform them, when it pleases his
godly wisdom.

Question.

Whence comes faith?

Answer,

It is the gift Math. 11.25 27. and. 13.11 Acts. 16.14 Romans 12.6 Galat. 5.22
Ephesians. 2.8
of God, wrought in my heart by the preaching of the Gospel, and by the holy
Ghost.

Question.

What is the sum of the faith?

Answer.

I believe in God the father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus
Christ his only son our Lord, which was conceived by the holy Ghost, borne of
the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried,
he descended into hell, and rose again the third day from the dead, he ascended
into heaven, and sits on the right hand of God the father almighty, from
thence shall he come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the holy
Ghost, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgeuenes of
sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.

Question.

What art thou taught hereby?

Answer.

1 First, what to believe of God my father and creator.

2 Secondly, of Christ my redeemer. Thirdly, of the holy ghost my sanctifier.
Last of all, concerning the church of God.

Question.

What can thou say of God?

Answer.

God is John. 4.24
a spiritual nature Romans 16.26
everlasting 1. Sam. 45 5.6.7
almighty, Psalm. 139 7.8.9
infinite, Psalm. 119.137
true, Math. 19.17
good, Psalm. 11.7
righteous, and Exodus 34.6
merciful, Genes. 1.1
who has made the world, and John. 1.1
has begotten the son of him self from everlasting.

The son is Prou. 8.23 Hebr. 1.3 Apocal. 1.8
wisdom and image of the father, begotten of the father, very God of very
God, John. 1.14 Galat. 4.4
who in his time appointed, became man.

The holy Ghost is Ioh. 14.16.26
the power and virtue proceeding from them both: which three, although they be
Mat. 3.16.17
distinct in persons, yet are they Deuteronomy. 6.4 John. 1.1. and 5.18.21 1. John. 5.7
equal and al one in Godhead, eternity, dignity, and power.

Question.

What say thou of the first part of this faith?

Answer.

I believe that God is not only the Math. 3.17 Romans 8.16
natural father of his son Christ, but also that he is by grace my father, by
whose wisdom as heaven and earth and all things therein contained, were made,
so the same by his Psalm. 145.15 Hebr. 1.3 Mat. 10.29
power is governed and preserved.

Question.

What think thou of the second?

Answer.

I believe that Hebr. 4.15
the son of God became man, in all things like unto me, only syn excepted,
and in my nature wrought what was needful to my salvation, Math. 1.21 Acts.
4.12
wherefore he is named Jesus, that is, a saueour.

Question.

How is thy salvation wrought?

Answer.

This word Christ, does teach the same, for first it signifies him to be a
king, and to have purchased to him self Act. 20.28 Luke 1.33
by his blood, the spiritual kingdom of his church, John. 8.36 1. John. 3.5
1. Ios. 13.14 1. Cor. 15.55
all the enemies thereof conquered. Which kingdom now he governs Ephesians. 1.13
1. Cor. 6.19
by his word, and by his spirit, whereby he reigns in my heart, and in the
hearts of his elect.

Secondly, it teaches that he was a Hebr. 5.56.7
priest to offer up him self once for all a sweet sacrifice, to take away my
sins, and to be a John. 14.13 Romans 8.34
mediator, by who^, and in whose name I may offer up my prayers to God my
heavenly father, and through him be heard.

Thirdly, it puts me in mind that he was Act. 3.21
a Prophet, sent to preach the will of his heavenly father, whom Math. 17.5
alone I must hear and obey, as my Lord, who being thus appointed of his
father, Mark. 14.10 and 15.15.24 Ioh. 19.38
was betrayed of Judas, condemned by Pilat, crucified by the Jews, buried by
Joseph of Aromathia, and Nicodemus, suffered Esaias. 53.4 Colos. 1.22
in his body, not only the punishments due to my body, but also Mat. 27.46
in his soul the punishments due to my soul, that was, the very torments of
hell, and death, and separation from God, Romans 5.19 Colos. 2.14 1. John. 3.8
Apoc. 20.14
by whose death my obedience is wrought, the malediction of Gods law cancelled,
the devil, and al his power subdued, the wrath of God appeased, and I set in
his favor again. And thus is the death of Christ, the only and full ransom
for my sins, by virtue whereof, sin also dies, and is killed in me.

Question.

What say thou of his resurrection?

Answer.

Romans 4.25
As he dyed for my sins, so he rose again for my justification, 1. John. 3.8
having gotten the victory over sin, death, hell, and damnation, and gives me
power through his spirit Romans 8.10.11
to rise unto newenes of life, assuring me, that my bodily death shall be no
destruction, but I shall rise again at the last day, to life everlasting.

Question.

Show thy mind of his ascension.

Answer.

He ascended Acts. 1.^. and. 3.21 Math. 28 18.20
with his body into heaven, where he remains, having al power given him of
his father, but with his spirit he is present with his people: John. 14.2
Titus. 2.5 Colos. 3.1.2
by which his ascensio^, he has taken possession for me in heaven, where he
also continues a mediator to make intercession for me to his father, and
finally teaches me to set mine affection upon heavenly things.

Question.

What meanest thou by his coming to judgment?

Answer.

I believe that he which is my saueour Mat. 24.31 2. These. 1.8.10 Luke 21.35
shall come to clear me and al his elect in judgment, and to condemn the
wicked, which in their life time refused him, to follow their pleasures.

Question.

What say thou of the holy Ghost?

Answer.

I believe that 1. Cor. 6.11
he is the spirit of sanctification, 2. Cor. 4.6
given to lighten my mind, John. 16.13
and to lead me into all truth, he is 2. Cor. 1.22
the earnest of mine inheritance in heaven, Ephesians. 1.13
the seal to imprinte Gods promises in my heart John. 7.36 Esaias. 55.1
the fountain of grace, and the water which purges me from mine uncleanness,
and To. 8.10.11
makes me to dye to sin, and to be holy unto God.

Question.

Show thy mind concerning the church.

Answer.

The church is Romans 8.29 Ephesians. 1.4 10.11
the society of al faithful people whom God in Christ has chosen to salvation
before the world was made, of 1. Ioh. 3.21
which number I believe that I am one.

Question.

What be the marks thereof?

Answer.

John. 8.47 and. 10.27
The sincere word of God, Mat. 28.19
the right administration of the sacraments, Math. 18.17. 1. Cor. 5.1.
and ecclesiastical discipline.

Question.

Why is the church called holy?

Answer.

Because God will have his people to live Titus. 2.12
holyly, soberly, and rightuously in this world, and not Ephe. 4.30
to grieve the holy ghost by any uncleanness, by who^ they be sanctified, and by
whom whilst they suffer themselves to be led, they John. 16.13
cannot err in matters of faith and salvation.

Question.

What means the Communion of Saints?

Answer.

It signifies Romans 12.5 1. Cor. 12.1^
the fellowship which all the elect have one with another, 1. Pet. 4.10 Galat. 6.2
communicating according to the measure of faith, al spiritual graces amongst
themselves, Ephesians. 4.3
studying to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.

Question.

What beleeuest thou of the forgiveness of sins?

Answer.

First, I believe that before my sins be forgeuen me, Romans 5.8.10 Ephesians. 2.1.2
1. Cor. 6.11
there is nothing in me but mere wickedness. Secondly I believe that al my sins,
and the punishment thereof be taken away 1. Pet. 2.4 Esaias. 53.5 1. Cor. 1.30 2.
Cor. 5.21
by Christ's death, and I made partaker of his righteousness. Thirdly, I believe
Romans 3.25
that faith alone, without any worthiness of my self, does make me partaker of
these graces.

Question.

What say thou of the rest, the resurrection of the body, and life
everlasting?

Answer.

I believe when this life is ended, that Eccle. 12.7 Apoc. 14.13 Luke 16.22
Philip. 1.23
my soul shall go to God, and my body rest in the earth to the last day, when
they shall both join together again 1. Cor. 15.53
incorruptible, and remain with God for ever in the kingdom of heaven.

Question.

Can such a faith as this be fruitless, and without good works?

Answer.

No, but good works do follow faith, as the Math. 7.17 James. 2.24 1. Pet. 1.12
testimonies and fruits of my thankfulness to God, whereby my faith is known,
and approved by men: Galat. 5.6
wherefore it is called a faith which works by love.

Question.

What works must thou do?

Answer.

Such as be commanded me in the Matthew. 19 17.18
law of God, 1. Cor. 1.8 Ephesians. 2.10
which as they come of grace given me, and not of mine own power, so must they
needs be done: for first 1. Pet. 1.16
God has so commanded. Secondly, his Romans 6. toto Titus. 2.14
benefits bind me thereto. Thirdly, Colos. 2.12
my baptism does teach me to dye unto sin, and live unto righteousness.
Fourthly, Mat. 5.36 1. Pet. 2.12
I must gloryfy god by my well doing. Last of all, 2. Pet. 1.10
I must make strong my faith and election, and learn to avoid the wrath of
God.

Question.

What reward shall thou have for thy good deeds?

Answer.

The works which I do before I be justified before God by Christ, Romans 14.23
Hebr. 11.6 John. 3.26
cannot please him, because they be done without faith. The works which follow
my regeneration, Apoc. 7.14 Math. 25.40 Luke 17.10 1. Cor. 15.58
do please God, not because of any worthiness of mine in them, but God accepts
them, because of my faith in Christ, through whom they are not don in vain, so
that the reward which is given unto them, comes only of Apocal. 22
the free mercy and favor of God, whilst he rewards not my deserts, but
crowns his gifts of grace in me.

Question.

With what helps does God further thee to salvation?

Answer.

Besides that the word of God 2. These. 3.3
does help to uphold my faith, Mat. 28.19 1. Cor. 11.23 Gene. 11.11
the sacraments and prayer are also helps to me, for by them the Lord helps
mine infirmity, by outward signs representing to me spiritual graces.

Question.

Do the sacraments serve thee to any other purpose?

Answer.

They serve not only to Exodus 12.11 12.13 Math. 26.26 and.27.19 1. Cor. 11.26
1. Cor. 11.17 Exodus 42.43 1. Sam. 7.26
teach me heavenly things, but also to kyndle a desire of Gods promises in my
heart, to stir me up to thanks giving for my redemption, to knyt me in love
with the godly, and as marks of Religion to testify how I differ from the
Heathen and wicked: wherefore, such as refuse to use the same, Mark. 8.38 Luke
14.18 24
do not only deny God, but are also arrogant and proud.

Question.

What is a Sacrament?

Answer.

It is an holy sign, instituted of Math. 21.25 John. 3.5 Acts. 2.38 Romans 4.11
God, to confirm my faith, and to seal in my heart the promises of Gods mercy
toward me for the forgiveness of my sins and salvation in Christ.

Question.

Whether do the sacraments give grace to the receiver or no?

Answer.

They Acts. 2.38
neither of themselves nor in themselves includ or give grace, for that is the
gift of the holy ghost, but they be holy signs, whereby, as by an instrument,
God does work and seal grace in my heart by faith received, and yet they be
not bare or naked signs, but grace is truly present to my faith, when I
receive the same aryght.

Question.

How many Sacraments be there?

Answer.

Two, the one is Baptism, wherewith I am received into Christ's church. The
other is the Supper of the Lord, wherewith I am nourished in the same.

Question.

What is Baptism?

Answer.

It is a sacrament wherein as water washes away the filthiness of my body, so 1.
Pet. 3.21
the blood of Christ sprinkled upon my soul, by the hand of faith, washes
away my sins, and the punishment thereof, whereby Romans 6.5
I am incorporate into his body, and made partaker of his benefits, to dye unto
sin, and to live unto righteousness.

Question.

Why are children to be baptized?

Answer.

Because by Ephesians. 2.3 Romans 5.12 Acts. 2.39 Genes. 17.7
nature they be the children of wrath by Adams sin, to whom also the promise of
Gods free mercy and favor reaches.

Question.

What is the Lords supper?

Answer.

Mat. 26.26
It is the sacrament of my redemption by the death of Christ, wherein by the
mystical receiving of bread and wine, through a true faith, I am made 1. Cor.
10.16 Luke 22.19 John. 6.51
partaker of all the benefits of Christ's passion, for as bread broken does feed
and nourish my body, and wine refresh my heart, so the Luke 22.19 John. 6.51
body of Christ was torn upon the cross, and his blud shed, to wash away my
sins, and to feed and refresh my soul to life everlasting.

Question.

Whether is the bread changed into the natural body of Christ, or no?

Answer.

The Sacraments of bread and wine Math. 26.29 John. 6.51 53.5. 1. Cor.
10.16.17. and 11.24
remain still in their former nature and substance, nevertheless there is a
great change, for those things which before were but as common meats, are now
made the Sacraments or holy signs of Christ's body and blood.

Question.

How do thou eat Christ's body, or drink his blood?

Answer.

John. 6.35
Spiritually, and by grace, whilst I believe that he dyed for my sins, Romans 4.24
and rose again for my justification, for it is faith that makes me partaker
of his benefits and goodness which are sealed to me by his Sacraments.

Question.

Do all men which receive this sacrament, receive the spiritual grace alyke?

Answer.

As in Baptism none 1. Pet. 3.21 Acts. 2.38 and.8.18. Mark. 16.16
but the faithful receive remission 1. Cor. 11 28.29
of their sins, so in the Lords supper, none but such are partakers of the
grace, and benefits of Christ's death. The wicked in deed receive the outward
elements of bread and wine, but because they lack true faith, they are not
partakers of the spiritual grace.

Question.

How must thou frame thy self to receive this sacrament worthily?

Answer.

First I must Math. 26.75 Ierem. 24.7 Joel. 2.12.13 Romans 6. toto
consider the greeuousnes of my sins, and from my heart unfeignedly hate and
detest the same, and ever after give my self to godliness and virtue. Secondly,
1. Cor. 11.28. and. 2. Cor. 13.5
I must try and examine my self whether I have a true faith in the promises of
Christ. Thirdly Matthew. 5.24 and. 22.39
I must reconcile my self to all men, and continue in Christian love.

Question.

Now remains the other help given thee of God, that is to say, prayer: tell
me what it is.

Answer.

Prayer is the Math. 6.6 John. 16.23 1. Tim. 2.8
lifting up of my heart to God, and the asking in Christ's name, of things
needful to me and the whole church, Philip. 4.6 Colos. 4.2
with thanks giving for his benefits, and goodness.

Question.

To whom must thou pray?

Answer.

To Psalm. 50.15 John. 16.33
God alone, first, because I Romans 10.14
believe in him alone. Secondly, he alone 1. Reg. 8.39
knows my heart: thirdly Esaias. 40.8
he will not give his glory to any other, and therefore I am forbidden to pray to
saints.

Question.

How can thou which art a sinner, pray to God which hates sin?

John. 14.13.14 and. 16.23 Acts. 4.12 1. Ti. 2.5.6 1. John. 2.2
Answer.

I pray not in trust of mine own righteousness, but in the name of Christ, who
is the John. 14.6
way for me to come to the father, who Romans 8.34 1. Tim. 2.5.6 1. John. 13
John. 13.24
continues my mediator at the right hand of the father, d who loves, and
has Colos. 1.22
reconciled me to the father, Math. 3.17
and in whom the father is well pleased.

Question.

For whom must thou pray?

Answer.

For all men living, for 1. Ti. 2.1.2 Matthew. 5.44 Luke 6.27
kings, magistrates, ministers, yea, and for my enemies: but for the dead I
have no commandment to pray, neither can I help them after they be gone hence,
for as they be found at the day of their death, so shall they rise again, only
this I can do, to give God thanks for their deliverance out of this world.

Question.

How must thou prepare thy self to pray?

Answer.

First, I must Romans 8.26 1. John. 5.14
be touched with the necessity of those whom I pray for, Matthew. 6.7
my mind must be devout, and not carried to and fro with vayn thoughts. I must
appear before God Psalm. 51.17 Jacob. 1.6
in true repentance and faith, Math. 5.23
being at love with all men, Esaias. 1.18 and. 59.2
framing my life ryghtuously, 1. John. 5.14 1. Cor. 14. toto
asking in such a tongue as I understand, according to the will of God.

Question.

How must thou pray?

Answer.

According to the form prescribed of our savior Christ, in these words, Our
father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive
us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us
not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the
power, and the glory, for ever. So be it.

Question.

What is the meaning of this prayer?

Answer.

We pray to God in the first petition, that Psalm. 89.5.6 1. Cor. 10.31 Joshua.
24.14 15
his glory may appear, and that Romans 2.24
our lives and conversation may set forth the same. In the second, we pray that
God would John. 16.13 To. 8.10.11
govern the kingdom of his church, killing sin, and the lusts thereof in the
same, and to renew it to righteousness of life. That he would also Romans 16.20 1.
John. 3.8
tread down Satan and al his power, and that he would shortly Apo. 22.20
accomplish the number of his elect, and hasten the coming of Christ to
judgment. In the third we pray, Luke 22.42
that al our doings may be agreeable to his will, without contradiction or
murmuring. In the fourth, we desire him Psalm. 14.1 15
to grant us whatsoever is needful to the sustenance and preservation of our
life, and that all our doings may be to his glory, and the profit af our
neighbors. In the fifth we pray Psalm. 51.9 1. John. 2.12 and. 18.35 Math. 5.45
for the forgiveness of our sins and the punishment thereof, for his mercyes
sake, even as we shall pardone others their offenses done to us, without bearing
malice or hatred toward them.

In the last we pray that God Ephesians. 6.10 Romans 16.20
would guide us with his spirit, that we may get the victory over Satan, sin,
and hell, and be defended from all evil. After we conclude with these words:
For thine is the kingdom. etc. to set forth our desire to his glory, his
honor, and praise, whose power is also infinite, and therefore he can grant our
requests. Romans 11.36 Act. 4.9.11 Psalm. 114.7 1. Chro. 29 10.
We end with this word, Amen, both desiring that what we have asked, may be
fulfilled, and also assuring our selves, that our requests shall be fulfilled
accordingly as they be agreeyng to the will of God.

Question.

Is there any help for thee, to pray more devoutly?

Answer.

Yea truly, 1. Pet. 5.11 Acts. 13.3
fasting is a special preparatiue to the same*

Question.

What is a Christian fast?

Answer.

It is not only an Esaias. 58.3 Joel. 2.12. Psalm. 35.13 Zachar. 7.5
abstinence from meats, and drynkes, to chastise my body, but also from sin and
the delights thereof, which hurt the soul, to the end through true repentance,
faith, Godly prayer, and renouncing of evil, the Spirit may have dominion in
me.

Question.

What is the right use of fasting?

Answer.

1. Cor. 9.27
First to chastise my body, and to bring it into subjection to the spirit.

Joel. 2.12
Secondly, to be a witness of my true repentance and submission to the will of
God.

Math. 26.41
Thirdly, that my spirit may be more ready to prayer.

Question.

Is there any abuse in the exercise of fasting?

Answer.

Yea, many, Esaias. 58.3 Zachar. 7.5
first to fast longer then the body may endure, and after to fare deliciously.
Secondly, Colos. 2.16 Galat. 4.10 1. Tim. 4.3
to put holiness in fasting one day more than another, or in absteyning from one
meat more than from an other. Thirdly, Esaias. 58.3 Romans 3.24
to think by fasting to purchase forgiveness of sins, whereas the same comes
only of the free mercy of God in Christ, without any man's worthiness or
deserving. Last of all, in absteyning from meats, not to Galat. 5.24 Titus.
2.12
abstain from sins, and all things which cause or nourish the same: for since
the life of man ought to be a meditation of godlynes, this ought to be the
endeavor of the faithful, to live godly, soberly, and ryghtuously in this
world, waiting for the blessed appearance of Jesus Christ their only savior
and redeemer. To whom with the father, and the holy Ghost, three distinct
persons, and one eternal God, be al laud and praise, for ever. Amen.
