The Principles of Christian Religion.
EVery Christian which desires to attain eternal life in heaven; must know
how condemnation Rom, 5. 18. 19.
and sin came on all men, by the offense of our first father Adam (from whom
we are all descended) And therefore he, and his posterity accursed.

And how that condemnation and curse Ioh, 17. 2. 3. Rom, 5. 18. 19.
is put from us: (and the joyful eternal life attained) Only, by the mercy
of God: through faith in Jesus Christ our savior. Mar, 16. 16. Mat, 16. 26.
27. Ephe, 1. 4. 1. Pet, 1. 15. 9. Ioh, 3. 18.


Therefore every Christian must know, what he must believe; and how to serve
God: Thereby to obtain forgiveness of all his sins in this life: that he may
attain unto eternal life in heaven.

The faith in Jesus Christ, which we Ioh, 17. 2. 3. Mat, 22. 37. to 40. Gal,
5. 14.
must believe; and the true serving of God, according to his holy will: Is
breifely comprised in the Creed: The ten commandments of almighty God:
the Lo(...)s prayer: and the right use of the holy Sacraments. so Religion
consistes in faith, and obedience.

The Creed, teaches what we must believe.

The ten commandments, shows us our duty toward God: and our duty
toward our neighbor.

The Lords prayer, teaches us how we must pra^; and for what, we must pray.

The holy Sacraments are ordained to be holy signs, and assured tokens to us;
of the mercy of God, and forgiveness of sins: For the merits death and
passion, of Christ Jesus our savior.

These four parts contains faith (which is the believing of the Gospel.)
The Law, Prayer, and Sacraments. (Or more shorter, The Law: and the Gospel.)

Those articles of faith which we must believe: are these that follow.
Commonly called the Apostles Creed.

The Creed.
I Believe in God, the father almightye maker of heaven and earth.

All my hope, trust, and belief, for all things I believe in God.
I shall need (either heavenly or earthly) is in the same (A) only very God,
that made the heavens and the earth.

(B) The father of our Lord Jesus Christ (C) and my father for Christ his sake.
(For he has chosen all the faithful in Christ, to be his children: And
loves them.)

Who is so (D) almighty: that he made Almighty: maker of heaven and earth.
the heavens and the earth, and all things therein: with his word. And does
still so preserve rule and govern them: that nothing happens in this world,
but by his determination, will, and foreknowledge.

It is God only, that gives fair weather and foul weather: plentye and all
things else; as pleases him. There is not any thing that happens to me in
blessings or punishments, but by the appointment and foreknowledge of almighty
God. Whereby I know that the devil is not able to do any hurt to me, until
God suffer him for my punishment: and that only so far as he gives the
deuell leave. The wicked spirits, the wicked people, and the wild beasts* are
the messengers of God; to execute his judgments and punishments.

(C) This almighty God is so wonderful, mighty and incomprehensible: that my
mind (nor any man whatsoever) is not able to conceive what he is. But Christ
has taught us: that this our good God and father, is a spirit.

is that (A) savior which God promised, from the beginning of the world: and
is also (B) my savior. And I believe, that God will be merciful unto me; and
(c) forgive me my sins for his sake.

Christ Jesus has reconciled all the faithful unto God; by the sacrifice of
his death. And is the ransom for our redemption (for it pleased almighty God,
to have his justice so satisfied).

Christ has (D) wrought and done for me, all that is needful for my
salvation: if I believe in him, and trust in his death and merits. Whatsoever
Christ has wrought for man's salvation, pertains also unto unto me; and I
shall be pertaker thereof.

We must not (E) any where else seek salvation but only in Christ. That as by
the offense of our father Adam (who was the first man in this world)
condemnation came on all men: and therefore he, and his posterity; from whence
we are all descended, accursed: So theris no means to bring us from this curse
and eternal damnation, but only by Jesus Christ our Lord: for by him God
promised salvation, from the beginning of the world.

Whereby the holy fathers before Christ's 1. Cor. 10, 1, to 5. John, 8, 56.
coming (in the flesh) were saved by believing, that the savior Christ
should come to redeem them; and obtain of God forgiveness of their sins: and
we are saved by believing Christ is come: and has wrought all that is
needful for our salvation.

So by (F) our true faith, Christ his righteousness Faith.
is made ours: by believing, that the once offering of his body and blood is a
full satisfaction for our sins to God the father. And that by his obedience and
fulfilling of the law of God: we shall be made righteous and just before God.
For as by the disobedience of our first father Adam, we are all made sinners:
So Se more at large for faith: after in the 10. article and at the end of the
Creed.
by the obedience of Christ Jesus, all the faithful are made righteous. Al
those are made righteous by Christ, which do believe and trust in his death and
merits: and do repent and amend their wicked lives.

Christ promised from the beginning, and is that savior promised.

does rule and govern the whole world.

(C) And by his almighty power and working of the holy Ghost he makes all the
faithful to be his members, and to be one with God, as God, is in him, and he
in God. And so the faithful have Christ dwelling in the^, and are his members;
and owe to him honor and reverence, as they honor the father: therefore he is

This Jesus my savior, in whom I believe: Which was conceived by the holy ghost
was conceived in the womb of the holy Virgin Saint Mary (A) by the only
power of the holy ghost. (And was borne and formed of her substance).

Although the holy Virgin was betrothed to Joseph to take him for her husband,
and therefore acknowledged him as her husband: Nevertheless Iosephe knew not
her body (at any time before this Jesus our savior was borne). Christ Jesus,
conceived of the holy Virgin without sin, by the power and virtue of the holy
ghost.

This Jesus our savior (B) is the seed of the woman, and of Abraham: In whom
all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.

And he was borne very man: of the holy Virgin formed and framed of her
substance. Being borne first a young babe, and after grew unto man's state
as we do: and lived here on the earth until the thirty three year of his
age. He hungered and thirsted* slept, and was werie of travel: Thereby showing
that he was perfect man. And also by his wonderful miracles, showed him self
to be perfect God.

(C) Christ as concerning his divine nature is very God: he descended
merueilously John, 1. 14.
from heaven, and yet his divine nature left not heaven. His divine power and
majesty filled the whole world as God. And where it is said the word was made
flesh: that is to be understood, That Christ united and joined the manhood
to the Godheade: So as the Godhead had his several property, and was not
infused or turned into flesh, nor mingled with the body: but had his seat in
the manhood; As my soul has in my body. For my soul is not my body; nor my
body is not my soul: But either of them have their several properties
remaining. So is Christ: one God in substance with the father and the holy
ghost: And perfect man also: as I am in all things (sin excepted). It was
his will to be merueilously conceived in the virgins womb* and to dwell in her
womb for a time, and of her to be borne: and to be conversant here on earth
until the thirty three year. And so was the son of God, as begotten of the
father almighty: and the son of man, and seed of Abraham, by being borne
and nourished in the womb of the holy Virgin Saint Marie.

Christ Jesus was conceived by the holy Ghost.

(A) Christ suffered under Pontius Pilate: He suffered under Pontius Pilate.
when he was governor over the Jews in Jury.

Christ then suffered his manhood to be most wickedly betrayed, by Judas his
own disciple: and to be most falsely and maliciously accused by the Jews,
condemned and scourged; with other vile abuses: And finally suffered his
manhood (or man's nature) To be put to death on the cross, as a malefactor.
Because it was so appointed by God from the beginning of the world: that the
same manhood, (or man's nature) should be put to death and suffer those
injuries; for a sacrifice and redemption: for the sins of all the world.

Christ was crucified: he, in all his life Was crucified
time here on the earth, suffered pain and grief for our sins.

Christ yielded himself (in our place and steed) to satisfy God (his father)
for our sins: and by his death and extreme torments, he appeased the wrath of
God toward us; and reconciled us to God: and so by his death, has delivered
us from the tyranny of the devil, and from eternal death: if we believe in
him.

God was displeased with us for the offense of our first father Adam, and in
his justice he would not leave that sin unpunished; even to Adams whole
posterity. For that we were not able to satisfy his wrath; therefore Christ
Jesus came pure and innocent, and obeyed God his father in all things, and
fulfilled the law: and suffered his manhood to be put to a vile death on the
cross, that his obedience and death might be a ransom for our sins, to God
his father. And that the sins of all that truly believe and trust in him:
might be laid upon him and forgiven them. And so by faith in Christ Jesus (and
trust in Gods mercy, for his sake) we are absolved, and obtain remission of
our sins: and be reconciled to God.

ANd buried.

(A) Christ his manhood being dead: was And buried
buried after the common manner of men. And his body lay in the grave till his
resurrection.

The stone over the grave where Christ was buried (until his resurrection) was
kept with soldiers: whereby appears evident the very death of his manhood,
and the separation of his soul from his body. And so by his death the mystery
of our redemption was accomplished: the wrath and anger of God appeased: and
peace made between God and us. Our redemption depends wholly of the death of
the manhood of Christ: for the ransom for our sins, is his death and passion.

(A) Mat, 27, 24, etc, Luke 23, John 19. Christ suffered his manhood to be put
to death: for to be a sacrifice and attoneme^t, for the sins of all the elect
and faithful.

(A) Christ the third day after his death The third day he rose again.
rose again, by his divine power, and united his Godhead and soul and body
together: and in his manhood took life again.

Our savior Christ by the space of forty days (after his resurrection) often
showed him self alive, in his manhood united to his Godheade (by many
infallible tokens) and was conversant with his disciples, and was seen of more
then five hundred brethren at once. The same body which suffered, and was put
to death: did rise again, and was glorified (all infirmities being done away)
having the Godheade united to the same (his man's) body which rose again.

(B) By this his rising again, Christ shows him self to be the son of God:
and the promised savior. And also shows (manifestly) that he has conquered
and overcome, the devil, sin, and death: and is now the author of our life:
For our righteousness is restored, by his resurrection.

(C) And his rising again, is a sure pledge to me: that my body (after this
life) shall in like manner rise again. This his rising again is a most great
comfort to all faithful: and the victory of our faith.

(D) As he is risen from death: so he causes me, as a member of him, to rise
from sin: and delight in righteousness. Christ has given me of his holy
spirit, which subdueth sin in me: and so mortifieth my flesh, that I hate
sin and satan: And thereby I feel sanctification, and new life to be
begone in me, which certifieth my conscience, I am in Christ: and so of God.
This benefitte I receive by Christ's rising again, who is now the author of
my salvation. So he died for our sins: and rose again for our righteousness,
to purchase us life, with God his father. And has sent his holy spirit to be
our comfort, and to govern, lead and direct us, in our dooinges.

(^) Whosoever does not taste of mortification and newness of life: has no
part in the redemption of Christ. For he gives strength to the faithful to
subdue sin in some measure; and to walk in a new life, and righteousness
here on earth.

(F) Christ rose from dead, To make us partakers of his righteousness,
sanctification, and glorification: which he purchased for us by his merit.

The body of Christ, which suffered: rose again.

HE ascended into heaven.

Jesus Christ our Savior, after his Resurrection, was here on the earth with
his corporal presence forty days. And after that (A) he ascended into heaven
bodily and visibly: the people looking, and seeing him when he ascended.

Christ his man's body (which he took in the womb of the blessed virgin saint
Marie) before his ascension, was not in heaven: The same body he glorified,
and took up into heaven, there to remain until he come again at the end of
the world, to judge the quick and the dead.

(B) Therefore we must seek Jesus christ in heaven; not in earth: spiritually,
not carnally: by faith, not by our senses. It is by the virtue of his holy
spirit, that he does co^municat and partake himself unto (Spiritual things,
are not seen but with the eyes of the spirit: For what is nearer to a man,
then his own soul; yet not any man ever at any time saw his soul, or the
soul of any other man).

(C) Christ his divine presence is in the earth with us: and is every where.
His divinity and Godhead, fills both heaven and earth: and dwells and
abides in the faithful. The body of Christ is in heaven, and has left the
world, until he come to the resurrection and judgment of all mankind:
Nevertheless his holy spirit virtue and power, fills heaven and earth: and
rules and governs us.

(D) Moreover by this his entrye into heaven, he has made easy unto us the
way: and does assure us, that the gate is already open unto us, and that our
sins be forgiven us: the which way before was shut up against us* because of
our sins. But now our savior Jesus is entered into the heavens with his man's
body (of the nature of our flesh) which is a gage and pledge, that he will
conduct us thither.

(E) We have these benefits by Christ his ascension. He is in heaven our
advocate and intercessor, to God his father for us. And by him, we shall also
ascend into heaven: and be glorified.

(F) And lastly, the holy ghost is sent to us: by whom Christ gathers,
comfort and defends his church, to the worlds end. The holy ghost was
also given to the godly which were under the law before Christ's ascension and
coming in the flesh: but that was in respect of his coming in the flesh, and
his ascentio^ and glorification, which was then to come. After Christ his
glorification: the holy ghost was given more abundantly.

Christ ascended visibly into heaven: there his body to remain till he come
again to judgment.

This is the meaning of the right hand: That is, has equal power to rule. God

is given him in heaven and earth over all things.

Christ by his Power shall raise to life again all the bodies of all mankind,
to do and execute the last judgment on them, at the general resurrection: for
he is ordained of God to be the Judge of the quick and the dead.

Then shall the faithful which believed in him, be gathered into the heaven and
receive everlasting joy and glory. And the^ the reprobate and unbelievers shall
depart^ into hell with the devil: there to remain in everlasting pain and
torments.

(B) This is a singular comfort to all the faithful, to know assuredly, that
none shall be their judge, but he that is their savior.

(a) I believe in the holy ghost. I believe and am fully persuaded, that the
holy I believe in the holy ghost
spirit of God, which proceeds from Christ: dwells in me, and all the
elect people of God: and sanctifies and preserves us, to everlasting life;
and defends us here from the power of the devil, and our wicked enemies.

So by the government and defense of the holy ghost, nothing shall happen to
me, but as my savior Christ Jesus, appoints (and suffers).

For our playner understanding of the power of the holy ghost: behold the sun
in the firmament (being one thing in substance) how all things in the world
have of the light and heat thereof. Wonderful much more (and more then any
tongue can express) does the power and virtue of the holy spirit of God,
spread over the whole world, to govern and rule the same. Whatsoever benefits
we receive from Christ: the same is given unto every of us, by the working of
the holy ghost.

(The wicked have some gifts of the holy ghost: as Judas and others, have had
the gifts of knowledge. But they had not the gift of sanctification,
regeneration, faith and conversion).

The holy ghost, fills heaven and earth, and is in every place: and yet
works salvation, but to the faithful only. So the gifts of the holy Ghost,
to salvation; are proper only to the faithful and elect.

(B) So I believe in God the Father; God the Son; and God the holy Ghost: Of
the Trinity.
and yet not three Gods, but one God. In these three persons it pleased God to
open him self to our faith, in their several woorking. For unto the divine
The Father.
essence (or substance) which we call God the Father (who is a spirit) is
attributed the creation of all things. And yet the Almighty power and Godheade
of the Son, and the holy Ghost, was then also at the beginning before all
worlds, and all one in substance: all three being the whole incomprehensible
divine substance: and yet the same substance is not divided.

Unto the Son (Christ Jesus) is attributed The Son.
our redemption. The almighty power and Godheade uniting or taking to it the
manhood, which was borne of the holy virgin Saint Marie: and in the same
manhood, the fullness of the Godheade (and almighty power) dwells and
abides bodily. The same two natures United together, we call Christ: who is
God and man.

(c) The virtue and almighty power The holy ghost.
which proceeds from Christ, working his good pleasure: the same is God the
holy Ghost.

(As the spirit of man which is in man is of the substance of man: So the
spirit of God, which is in God; is of the essence and substance of God: and
with God before the creation of the worlds).

So we be compelled by the christian verity to acknowledge every person by
himself to be God and Lord. And yet not three Gods, nor three Lords. For in
this Trinity none is before, nor after other: none is greater, nor lesser then
another: but the whole three persons be coeternall together and coequall. The
unity in Trinity, and the Trinity, in unity; is to be worshipped. He
therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity. And believe and
confess, that our Lord Jesus Christ the son of God, is God and man. God of
the substance of the Father begotten before the worlds: and man of the
substance of his mother borne in the world. Perfect God, and perfect man.
Equal to the father, as touching his Godheade: and inferior to the father as
touching his manhood. Who although he be God and man: yet is he not two,
but one Christ. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man: So God and
man is one Christ.

The holy ghost works in us, all the benefits we receive from Christ. And
preserves us.

be^ those people elected of God, to be saved: which have been in this world
from the beginning, and hereafter shall be to the end: of what country or
nation so ever through the whole world: of the which number I believe, I am one.

(B) God knew from the beginning all those that shall be saved: and has a
tender care over them. (C) Jesus christ is the head of those people; and they
are his members: all being united together by the power of his holy spirit, and
joined together in Christ as one body. He which is not a member of this Church,
is from Christ: and therefore shall not be saved.

(D) This Church is called Catholic (or universal) because the members of the
Catholic Church be in every nation and country, universally through the
whole world, without distinction of people.

(E) And the same church is called holy: because Christ is the head, and does
sanctify and make holy the church his members.

(F) This church is invisible: because men cannot visibly see, the faith,
repentance and conscience of the beleuers: nor know who they be which God has
chosen to eternal life. Therefore is this church invisible, and a matter of
faith: and faith is of things which is not seen.

(G) The members of this Catholic church here on earth are visible, (having
among them many wicked persons and hypocrites). The visible church of God; The
visible Church
is a company amongst men) wheresoever they be) which embrace and profess
the true doctrine of Christ: and use the holy Sacraments according to Christian
institution.

(H) This whole universal church, never erreth in the foundation of doctrine:
but many particular churches, which are members of this Catholic church, do
err, and have erred: as did some churches which the Apostles taught. Also the
church of Rome: and general counsels have erred, and condemned the doings one
of another: and have decreed direct contrary one to the other.

(I) Some (or many) of the elect people of God, may err; and fall from the
church for a time (as king David did) but they shall not finally fall away for
ever: but shall rise again by sorrowful repentance, and newness of life; and so
shall come again to God, and have their sins forgiven them.

The Catholic church are only those people which shall be saved: which ever
have been, or shall be.

the merits, death and passion, of Christ Jesus my Savior.

trust in Christ's death and merits, that al my sins shall be forgiven me; and
that I shall live in heaven with Christ for ever (So that I repent my sins
past, amend my wicked life, and have a continual earnest desire and endeavor
to my power to obey God, and to live godly). If I strive to resist sin with
all, my power: and so resist it, that I do not Romans 7. 15. etc. and 8. 1. 2.
1. John. 3. 6.
obey the lusts thereof (and delight in it) Then will God be merciful unto me;
and forgive me all my sins. For if I do that I would not; then is it not
I, that does it: but the sin that dwells in me (which for the time has
overcome me, till Christ strengthen me with his holy spirit to overcome it). So
a true christian in mind and affection, does serve God, with a readiness of
faith; and willing to keep his commandments (and to Use charity to his
neighbor): But in his flesh and outward doings, he is defiled with many
corruptions. Nevertheless having this faith: the holy Ghost will work, and
frame his heart; that all his desire (to his power) shall be to glorify God*
So the life of a true christian consistes inwardly in faith toward God: and
outwardly in charity toward his neighbor.

He that believes in Christ, and has repentance and newnes of life: God will
forgive his sins for Christ's sake.

(A) I believe that after this my life ended, The resurrection of the body.
my soul shall go to God that gave it: and my body shall rest in the earth
until the appointed time; for the general resurrection of all mankind.

At the general resurrection; by the power of Christ: This my body (which I
now have, although it were eaten with the fowls: or devoured by many wild
beasts, or fishes; or lie rotten in dust, scattered a great many of years)
shall be joined again to my soul: and shall be made like to the glorious body
of Christ, without all corruption, to live with him in heaven for ever. And I
shall see God in heaven in this flesh, and mine eyes shall behold him for ever.
(Almighty God by his word only, made the heavens and earth of nothing:
therefore he is able to raise our bodies out of the dust). At this general
resurrection of all mankind (that ever were in this world) my flesh and soul,
which I now have shall be restored, and joined together again, in the same
manner whereof they now consist (being altered from corruption, and made
immortal) and shall live with Christ in heaven for ever. And the bodies of the
reprobate, shall be then also restored: to live in hell for ever, in
everlasting torments.

This resurrection (as the holy Scripture 1. These. 4. 16. 17
shows) shall be in this manner. Christ shall discende from heaven with
multitude of Angels: and by his power all the bodies of all mankind that ever
were, shall be raised to life. And those which shall be then ly^ing, shall
be caught up in the clouds, with them that were raised: to meet the Lord in
the air. And then shall the elect be with the Lord, and remain with him for
ever. And the reprobate shall be sent to hell: there to remain in torments for
ever.

The day of the Lord shall come as a 2. Pet. 3. 13. etc.
thief in the night: in the which the heavens shall pass away with a noise,
and the elements shall melt with heat, and the earth with the works therein
shall be burnt up. But we look for new heavens, and a new earth, according
to his promise: wherein dwells righteousness. Wherefore seeing we look for
such things: what manner of persons ought we to be, in holy conversation and
godliness?

The bodies of all mankind shall be raised again: the elect to joy, the
reprobate to torments.

glorified, to live in joy with Christ for ever (of the which number, I believe
I am one). (B) And the wicked shall be without Christ in eternal pain: with
y^ devil in hell, for ever.

Everlasting life in heaven is given the faithful, by the free mercy of God;
for Christ his sake. And is begun in this life by faith and conversion (which
is a full purpose and intent, to live according to Gods commandments).
Eternal life is begun, here by conversion: and finished in heaven, by
glorification.

The peace of conscience (which is joy and gladness in God) does assure us in
this life, of everlasting life.

The faithful shall enjoy everlasting life and dwell with christ for ever.

The end of the Creed.
In this faith I am taught how and what to believe concerning God the Father:
who made me and all the world. Secondly what to believe concerning God the
Son: who redeemed me, and all mankind. Thirdly, what to believe concerning
God the holy Ghost: who sanctifies me, and all the elect people of God.
Fourthly, what to believe concerning Gods people, called the Church.

The conclusion how this faith justifies.
(A) This is the Catholic faith: which How this faith makes us righteous
before God.
except a man believe faithfully, he can not be saved.

(B) And by this faith, we have our sins forgiven us: and are justified and
made righteous (freely) by the only mercy of God, for the merits, death and
passion of Christ Jesus our savior and redemer.

(C) This faith whosoever has it: does What is faith.
wholly (and only) trust for his salvation, upon the mercy and promises of
God, in Christ. And comes unto Christ, with this true faith, repentance and
newness of life. And so continually loves righteousness, and hates the
doing of evil: for this faith will work in him conversion.

Now is to be called to mind, what Of faith: and the law.
has been heretofore said concerning sin. And that the whole life of a
Christian, consists in faith and charity. Sin entered on Adam, and all his
posterity Gene. 3. Romans 5. 12* etc.
(from whom all of us are descended) by his offense in breaking of Gods
commandment. And to make us more Romans 5, 20. and 3. 20.
sinful, and to know our sin: the law (or ten commandments) of almighty
God was given. Wherein God does Deuteronomy. 27. 26. Gal. 3. 10. Iam. 2. 10.
appoint us what we ought to do: and if we fail in any one point, his
terrible judgment and curse does rest upon us: and so eternal death.

(D) And forasmuch, as it is altogether Acts 15. 10. Gal, 3. 24.
above our strength and power to fulfill the law of God: Therefore our
merciful God has given us a mean of deliverance, to draw us out of this so
wretched a calamity: thereby to attain the heavenly eternal life. The which
mean is the foresaid faith, and trust in Gods mercy, for the merits, death
and passion of Christ Jesus our savior and redeemer: and by him only (and by
none other Acts 4. 12. Hebr. 10. 10. Ioh, 3. 18. and 17 3. and 14. 6.
way nor mean) it pleases our heavenly father, to have mercy upon us, and to
suucour us. And by this our true faith, the Law and curse thereof: takes no
hold in us; but has an end. Who so ever has this faith assuredly: The same
will work in him repentance and conversion, and cause him to hate evil (and
he that hates evil, will repent his doing of evil). Thus repenting the
breaking of Gods commandments, and our sins: we are by this our true faith
justified, and made righteous by Christ our Savior: our sins shall not be
laid to our charge. And thus being justified, The holy Ghost does sanctify
us: and provoke and stir us up to serve God: and to our power to reliue our
needy neighbors (having sufficient for our family: because he that ^. Tim.
5. 8.
provides not for them has denied the faith, and is worse then an infidel).
So he that has this faith, will love Christ, with all his power; and above all
things. And will have an earnest continual desire and endeavor to keep
Christ his commandments. Therefore this faith can by no mean be severed from
godly affections: because Christ dwells in the failhfull by his holy spirit
(and virtue) and sanctifies them. 1. Cor. 1, 30. 2. These. 2. 13. Hebr. 10. 14.
Phil. 2, 13. Acts 4. 12.
So faith and good works, are joined together. This is the only mean to
enjoy the eternal blessed life, and to dwell with God in glory for ever.

So I conclude; that he which has this faith, will to his power, endeavor to
worship God aright, and to keep his holy commandments.

They that believe not are condemned already* therefore faith is an assured
knowledge and trust, etc.

will relieve his nee die neighbors to his power.

The true and right worshipping of God, is by true faith in Christ: and obeying
his holy commandments.

The holy law of God, and his commandments: are briefly comprised in the
ten commandments of almighty God.

The ten Commandments of almighty God.
THe first four is the worship of God. The other six is the preservation of
mankind: which is our duty toward our neighbor.

In the commanding of virtues: the forbidding of vices is contained.

God is not loved, except our neighbor John 4, 7, 8. 20, 21.
be loved: nor our neighbor truly loved, except God be loved.

thou shall only have the almighty God (that created the heaven and earth)
for thy God. And thou shall have none other for thy God, but him only.

Thou shall love him with all thy heart, mind, soul, and power: and honor and
fear him above all. Thou shall put thy whole trust and confidence in him, and
pray unto him in all sickness, troubles and dangers, for help and succor:
And shall give him thanks and praise for all things, and acknowledge him the
governor, and giver of all things.

The end of this commanndement is; that due honor may be given to God, in
the mind, will, and heart of man.

That God is the gonornour and giver of all things: See proof hereof at large
before in the first Art^cle of the Creed.

In this commandment we are commanded, that we should not think or imagine
God, to be like man or woman, or any other thing: for we cannot imagine what the
almighty God is: his divine power is so incomprehensible. But we see and know
his greatness, so far as is needful for us to know, by the glory of the
heavens* and earth: and by his holy word and works. Mat. 15, 9. and 28, 20.

acts 5, 29.
Therefore we must not worship God, according to man's imagination: but as he
has commanded us in his word.

God will be worshipped in spirit and truth. And will not be represented by
any Image, or likeness, what so ever. Neither will he have us to worship
any Image in any manner of Religion: nor to do any honor, service or
obedience to it; nor to call upon it, nor bow down before it. God does
forbid these things, with most horrible and fearful threatenings.

In this Commandment all false worship of God is forbidden: and the true
worship of God commanded.



( Deu. 28, 58. and 5, 11. 29. luke 1, 50, leu, 19, 12.
) In this we are commanded: that we use with most high reverence the name of
God, when so ever we speak or think upon it. And that we do not use his
name, to evil uses: or falsely (and not in truth).

( Leuit. 19. 12 gal, 5, 19, 20, 21 deuteronomy. 18, 10, 11, 12. mala. 3, 5. leuit.
24, 14.
) They which use the name of God in false swearing, coniuring, witchcraft,
sorcerie, cursing, and such like: those do blaspheme the name of God; and take
his name in vain. And the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his
name in vain.

( Iere, 4, 2. mat. 5, 34, to 38 James. 5. 12, 1, pet. 4, 11. gal. 1. 20. col 3
17, 1. cor, 10, 31 2, cor. 1, 23. exo. 22, 10, 11. hebr. 6, 16.
) Also in this commandment we are commanded; that we never swear by the
name of God (in our common talk, though the matter be never so true) but
only to swear, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness: where the
glory of God is sought, or the salvation of our brethren, or before a
magistrate, witnessing the truth, when we are thereunto lawfully called.

( Deuteronomy: 6, 13. and 10, 20. iere. 5 7, and 12, 16.
) In which causes we must only swear by the name of God, and not by any
other thing.

This commandment consists in the right honorable usage of the name of God.



( Deuteronomy. 5, 14. exodus 23, 12, and 31, 13. eze. 20, 12.
) In this we are commanded to keep holy the Sabbath day: and to rest from our
labor in our calling on the same day: and that our servants may then also rest.

( Mark 2. 15, John 7, 22, 13.
) Nevertheless in that day, we may do any labor, that may not well be done on
another day.

The keeping holy of the Sabbath day, is thus: ( Acts 20. 7. and 16. 13. luke
4. 16, to 21. mar. 6, 2.
) We must assemble our selves together in one place with fear and reverence,
to hear (and lay up in our hearts) the word of God preached unto us: and
then to confess our sins unto God.

( Mat. 18. 19. Phil. 4, 6. 1. Cor. 16, 2.
) And also to pray together with one consent for such things we need: and to
give God thanks for the benefits we have received: and to give alms to our
needy brethren: ( Acts ^, 42. 1. cor. 11. 33.
) and to use the holy Sacraments in faith and repentance.

This is the outward keeping holy of the Sabbath day.

( Esa. 56. 2. and 58. 13.
) The inward keeping of it holy, is to rest from our worldly business; and
refrain from our froward desires: and so yield our selves wholly to Gods
governance.

( Heb. 4 ^.
) So shall our Sabbath be a figure of the holy everlasting rest.

( Mar. 2, 27. 28. nom. 15, 32 to 36. mat 12, 1 ^^ 9. col. 2, 16, 17
) We keep not our Sabbath literally as a ceremony with straight Religion (as
the Jews did). For the ceremony of the Sabbath (that we should not do any
manner of work therein upon pain of death: but that only which was appointed
to be done by the law) ended with Christ; and is abrogated.

( 1. Cor. 14, 26 40.
) But we retain the keeping holy of the Sabbath day, as a necessary remedy
to keep order in the Church: and that servant may then rest from their
labors, and then learn to know God. And also that our public prayers,
alms, and other good works, may be the better done of us.

( Romans 14. 5 6 Col. 2. 16. ^gal. 4. 9, 10. 11.
) To make difference between day and day; as though one were more holy in it
self, then an other: Saint Paul has taught us, that so doing is superstition
(or vain Religion) an honoring of that, which should not be so honored.

The causes why the Sabbath was instituted, was; for the public service and
worship of God. In which consists the study of the knowledge of god; of good
works, and of thankfulness unto God: for his good benefits given unto us.

Honor thy father and thy mother. ^
That thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God gives thee.

Honor in this commandment signifies: outward reverence, obedience and
love.

We must honor our father and mother; in esteeming and reuerencing of them: To
bear with them; not to speak evil of them, nor to curse them: and to our
power, if they have need; to releive cherish, and nourish them in all their
necessities: and to obey them; and wish to them all prosperity and health.

This is the duty which we owe to our father and mother. And God here
promises a blessing to those children, that do honor their parents.

In this commandment; all particular duties, which are commanded to every
person (in the holy Scripture) are included and commanded. That in this
obedience, God may be worshipped: and the society of mankind, preserved.

God forbids us all killing, fighting and quarelling: and all anger, malice,
and desire of revenge. And also al those things, which tend to the destruction
of the life of mankind.

We are here commanded to preserve the life of all mankind; by exercising the
works of mercy and love. Under the name of murder; are all sins which
accompany it comprehended. And all those things which tend to the safety of
our life and others; commanded. Negatiues include affirmatiues: Gal. 6. 10,
romans 12, 17, 18.
as, Thou shall do no murder: therefore thou shall aid and help thy
neighbor.

(B) When God commands a man Nom 35, 31, leuit. 24, 17. exo, 21, 12, etc.
to be slain: then God himself puts him to death by man, unto whom he
gives this charge. For if murderers, thieves, robbers, and such like, should
not be put to death: The fellowship of men should be destroyed. Therefore God
punishes, when the magistrate punishes.

The end of this commandment is the preserving of the life of mankind: and
forbidding of all things which tend to the destruction of mankind.

In this commandment we are forbidden all adultery and fornication, and all
evil desires of the heart: and all uncleanness, whatsoever, which might
intise us to unchaste behavior, or allure us to sin.

The end of this commandment is, the preservation of chastity: and the
forbidding of all vices contrary to chastity.

Incest and adnlterie, are much more heinous, then theft and robbery. For God
appointed Leu. 2010, etc, and 18, 29.
death in Moses law for the adulterers and incestuous persons: but not so for
thieves and robbers.

We are forbidden in this commandment, all stealing and robbing in outward
deeds. And all desire of any man's goods wrongfully, by deceyte and wrongful
dealings.

The end of this commandment, is the preservation of goods or possessions,
which God gives to every one, for the maintenance of their life.

Thou shall not steal: that is, thou shall not covet or attempt by deceyt, to
convey thy neighbors goods, to thee. Therefore thou must defend and preserve
them: and give thy neighbor his own. And live of that which is thine own.

In this we are commanded, that we never speak falsely in witness bearing:
nor never lie, flatter nor dissemble, whereby our neighbor may take harm.

The end of this commandment is; the maintenance of truth amongst men.
Therefore all untruths, lies, guyles, dissemblinges, slanders, backbitinges,
and evil speakings, are for bidden: for they are contrary to truth.

THou shall not covet thy neighbors 10
house. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors wife, nor his servant, nor his
maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.

In this commandment, Almighty God in plain words, does forbid all Mat* 5.

evil thought and motion is sin: and against this commandment.

The end of this commandment, is a rightnesse and inward obedience of all
our affections, toward God and our neighbor: and to maintain the safety of
our neighbor.

The sum of the law.
Our Savior Christ has included all these commandments, in these two: Thou
Matthew. 22. 37. to 41. luke 10. 27. to 38.
shall love the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and
with thy mind: this is the first and greatest commandment. The second is
like unto this: Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self. On these these two
commandments hang all the law and the Prophets.

A new commandment (says our John 13. 34. 3^.
Savior Christ) give I unto you: that ye love one another, as I have loved
you. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples* if ye love one
another. And this is the commandment of God (says 1. John 3. 23.
Saint John) that we believe in the name of his son Jesus Christ: and love
one another as he gave commandment. And (saint Paul says) the law is
fulfilled Gal. 5. 14. rom* 13. 8.
in this: thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self. For the end of the

heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.

If any man say he loves God, and hates 1. John 4. 20.

These are the commandments of Acts 15. 10. Gal. 3. 24. Romans 8. 8.

(Although I do all that I can, yet I break them daily.

godly Christian, is the knowledge of sin: because it is a rule whereunto he
is to frame his life: and a glass wherein he may see his wantes: whereby he
may desire more and more to be conformed unto God, and his law.

The law (of the ten commandments) Romans 7, 20, 21, 22*
is to be taught unto all mankind (and unto all the godly): that we may strive
and endeavor, to come as near as we can unto it. That by this desire of
fulfilling of the law, God may exercise us, in repentance and obedience: that
we may go forward more and more in godliness.

Although the law does not bind Rom, 8, 1, 2, 3. 4 and 10, 4. Ephe, 2, 14, 1,

rule to frame our lives by, unto the uttermost of our power. and the law is our
schoolmaster, Gal. 3. 24.
to bring us to Christ our savior, who has redeemed us from the curse of the
law, and obtained Gods mercy for us.

The law is holy, and the commandment Romans 7. 12. 1, Tim, 1, ^.
is holy, just and good. The law is good, if that a man use it lawfully.

Of Prayer.
THe things that have been hitherto spoken do plainly show, how needy and
void man is of all good things: and how he wants of himself, al helps of
salvation. Wherefore if we seek for help for our releife and need, we must
go out of our selves: and by faith to acknowledge, that what so ever we have
need of, what so ever wants in us: John 15. 7. Col. 1. 19.
the same is in God, and in our Lord Jesus Christ. And in Christ is the
fullness of Gods goodness: from whom we must draw by prayer (as out of a
plentiful fountain) whatsoever we have need of, and whatsoever wants in
us.

Mat. 21. 22. mar. 11. 24. ro^. 14. 13. and 9. 14. 26. 33. ephesians. 5, 3 12 heb. 4.
16. and ^o^. 12. iam. 1. 5. 6.
By faith our hearts are framed to call upon the name of God: and faith
obteyneth what so ever is granted by prayer. And with prayer we must crave of
Christ, that which we have learned to be in him: So by prayer our faith is
exercised* for faith is the cause of prayer: and prayer is the increasing of
faith.

2. Chro. 7. 14. psalm. 66. 18. eze. 18. 26 27. 31. 32. ro^. 14. 13
A right prayer requires faith and repentance: Without faith it is impossible
to please God, and where true faith is; there is also true repentance. Without
faith rhere is no true prayer: And without the love of our neighbor there is
no faith. Therefore we are taught by Christ, to pray one for another.

Prayer is necessary for all Christians, because it is the chief part of that
thankfulness which God requires of us. God will chiefly be worshipped of us,
and magnified: by prayer and thanksgiving. And prayer was ordained for us, to
bewail our miseries to God.

Prayer is a petition, with an ardent Prayer, what it is.
and earnest desire; whereby we ask of God, those things which he ha^h
commanded to be asked of him. And thanksgiving, is an acknowledging of a
benefit received: with giving thanks (and praise) for the same.

Romans 12. 1^ ephe. 6. 18. James 5. 15.
We must pray continually, for many dangers do hang over us every moment:
and temptations do continually assault us, and force us to crave help of God,
by Christ. Nevertheless, we must not trust by much Mat. 6. 7.
babbling, to wring any thing from God. Luke 11, 2. and 21, 36. psalm, 50, 14,
15, 23. and 1 16, 12. ephe 6, 18, col. 4. 2. 1, pet. 4. 7, iam. 5, 13, 14, 15.
We must pray because God has commanded, that we call upon him: and will
this way chiefly and principally be magnified of us. And we receive not those
blessings which are necessary for our safety and salvation: except we ask
them of God.

1, These. 5, 17 18. 1. tim. 2, 1, 2, 3 hebr. 13, 15 col. ^. 17.
And so of thanksgiving: without giving of thanks, we receive not such
things as are to be given, and are necessary.

They which have true faith, ask the grace of God. And they who have tasted of
Gods grace, show themselves thankful unto God for it: and do more and more
crave and desire it.

The wicked receive many gifts: but not those principal gifts, which are
proper to the elect: as faith, repentance, forgiveness of sins, and
regeneration (or newness of life). Also those gifts the wicked receive: they
do not receive them to salvation.

Since that all our prayers ought to be offered and presented to God, by our
Lord Jesus Christ and that we ( Rom, 8, 20.
know not how to pray as we ought to do) therefore our savior Christ has given
us the form of prayer. Not to bind our selves to those words: for Christ
himself used at other times John, 14, 1. and 17, iam, 1, 5. mat, 26, 39, 4^.
acts 4, 24.
other words, and longer speech. And the Apostles did so likewise.

But in this prayer, is given unto us, a law to pray aright, concerning the
things themselves, that ought to be prayed for: And so teaches us, when we
pray for particular things which we need: what things they must be that we
ought to pray for, and how to ask them.

Albeit, that we must make our prayers only to God for help: yet to demand
succor of men, is nothing contrary to this. For we put not our trust in
them, nor seek succor of them: but as the ministers and bestowers of Gods
goodness to our necessity and comfort. For what so ever we receive of any
man, we are bound to take and acknowledge it, as delivered from God, by him,
unto us: because men are the destributers of Gods benefits one to another.

It is requisite in prayer, that we observe Five things requisite in prayer.
these five things.

First that we must make our prayers John. 14, 13 14. and 16. 23. 1. john 5.
14. mar. 11. 24. iam. 1. 5, 6. and 4. 3. romans 8, 3. 4, 1. tim. 2, 5. 1. john 2.
1, 2.
only to God, in the name of Christ (and not to Saints, nor any other) for
Christ only is our intercessor, mediator and advocate to God for us.

Secondly, John 4, 23. 24. romans 8. 26. psalm 51. 17. and 145. 18.
that we be inwardly touched with the need of the thing we ask: having our
minds wholly bent thervppon (and not carried away with by thought).

Thirdly* Iam. 16. mark. 11. 24. 1. john 5, 24.
That we trust with full assurance, that our prayer shall be granted; so
far as the Lord does know them to be meet and needful for us.

Fourthly, Romans 12. 12. luke 18. 1, to 7. 1. these. 5, 17. col. 4. 2. ephe, 6,
18.
That we continue in prayer; although we have not our request at the first.

Fifthly, Iam. 4, 3. Romans 8. 26. 1. John 5, 14.
That we ask not those things which we think good in our own fantasy:
but only that which God commands us to ask of him in his word. Matt. 6,
9, etc. luke 11, 1, 2 etc.
All which things be taught in the Lords prayer.

1. Cor. 14, 15
We must pray with the spirit and understanding: And lift up our hearts to God
in our prayers. Psalm 25. 1.


Christ when he prayed: he lifted up John 17, 1.
his eyes to heaven, and kneeled on his Luke. 22. 41.
knees (which teaches us how we ought to pray).

The godly when they pray; they are sorry for their sins, and do crave
pardon of God, in the name of Christ, with an humble confession of their
faults: trusting (through Christ) to obtain their petition. And they rest
only upon the mercy of God, for Christ his sake and merit: craving nothing
but that which is according to his will.

IN that prayer which Christ taught his Disciples (which we call the Lords
prayer) our Savior Christ has taught us what we ought to pray for: and how to
pray. Therefore we must not look for any other thing; then is briefly
comprehended in that prayer.

The Lords prayer which our Savior Christ taught: is this that follows.

Our Father which art in heaven.

Our. By this word Our Iam. 5 16. romans 12. 4 5.
we are taught to pray one for another: because we are members one of another,
and united together 1. cor. 12, 13, 27, and 6. 15, 17. 19. 2, tim. 1, 1, 2, 3.
by the holy Ghost.

Father. And God is called our Father, in respect of our creation: because he
created us. Romans 8, 14, 15, and 5, 8. john 1, 12. gal. 4, 6. ephe. 1. 5, 6,
ioh. 20, 17, mat. 7. 11.
But in this prayer, we call God our Father: because he has chosen all the
faithful to be his children, and loves them, for Christ his sake.

By election through Christ, we are Gods children. Mar. 16. 16. john 3, 18,
36. 1. pet. 5, 7.
For if we do not believe in Christ; then are we not the children of God: but
the children of the devil. Therefore we can not call God our father, but by
our Savior Christ. For all those only that trust in his name, are chosen to
be the sons of God.

Which art in heaven. Esaias 66, 1. iere, 23, 24. psalm. 2, 4. and 103 19, and 11
5, 3, 16: and 123, 1.
God is said so dwell in heaven: Thereby to teach us to lift up our minds to
heaven, in our prayers.

God is in heaven most glorious, and has there his seat: yet his presence is
every where, and fills heaven and earth.



Hallowed be thy name. Rom 11. 33. 36, and 16. 27. 1, cor. 10. 31, 1, tim. 1,
17. luke 1 50. mat. 6, 33. psalm. 67, and 71, 8. job 1, 21. deuteronomy. 28, 58.
In this petition we desire the true knowledge, and worship of God; that due
honor may be given to him. (we may not speak nor think of him: without most
high reverence). Also that he would give us the knowledge of his holiness,
in faith and repentance: whereby we may glorify and praise his holy name:
and not to dishonor Romans 2, 24.
him by our evil living.

We sanctify and hallowe God, John 17, 2, 3.
when we acknowledge his mercy and providence, and praise him for the same:
and do know that of him, which he will have us to know. The end of all
things is Gods glory: Therefore 1. Cor. 10, 31.
all our doings, should be to his honor and glory. And we must desire,
that he will give us strength, whereby his divine name may be hallowed and
sanctified of us.

In this petition the name of God Mat. 28, 19. Psalm. 116, 13.
signifies God himself, and his works: and all those things which may be
attributed unto God.

THy kingdom come.

Thy kingdom come. Herein we desire the Lord Luke 17, 20 21. romans 8, 10, 11
psalm. 143, 10. John 16, 13.
to govern and preserve us with his spirit: and to correct in us all evil
desires, that we may obey him. Romans 8. 21, 22, 23. reave. 22, 20. mat. 6, 33.
luke 12, 32. and 22, 29, 30.
And also to hasten the gathering of his elect into his glorious kingdom: that
they may be delivered from all evil and wickedness.

John 3, 3. 1. pet. 1. 5. Romans 8, 9, to 15
Except God keep us, and erect in us his rule and kingdom: we shall never
sanctify his holy name. For where the holy spirit of God does not keep and
preserve: there will the devil be, to to work destruction and damnation.

The kingdom of God, is here taken John 18, 36. romans 14. 17. 1. cor. 4. 10.
to be the spiritual government; wherewith he governs all the elect, by the
virtue of his holy spirit, and by his word.

Christ does reign in us; when we do Mar. 6. 12, 16* and 8. 9. to 15.
mortify our flesh, and renounce our evil affections.

This kingdom of God has two parts: the one to direct and maintain the elect:
The other is to overthrow the enemies and reprobate.

THy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

Thy Will be done. etc. Ephesians. 1. 9. 11 and 5, 7. 1. john 5 14. romans 12. 2. 1.
these. 4. 3. 1. pet. 4 2. 1. john 2. 17 ioh. 9, 31. 1. cor. 4, 7. tit. 2. 12.
In this petition we pray, That God will strengthen and uphold us by his holy
spirit, to direct all our doings to his glory, that we may do his will: and that
nothing be in us, contrary to his will.

Heb. 13, 20 21. acts 9, 6. job 1, 21, mart. 26. 39, romans 1. 10 and 15, 32, 1,
cor. 4, 19.
We pray that we may be obedient to his will, and take patiently and
willingly (without murmuring) what so ever afflictions or troubles he sends
on us: that nothing be in us against his will: but that his will may be done in
earth, as it is in heaven. (That we may strive so far as we may, to such
perfect obedience).

Therefore we must desire the Lords Col. 1, 9. John 15, 4, 5* Phil. 2, 13. 2,
Cor, 3, 4.
help to strengthen us, to overcome sin* and to deliver us from it. That we
may thereby be able to please him in obeying his will.

In the former petition, we desire that God will begin his kingdom in us, by
ruling us with his holy spirit: and in this petition, we pray that we may
have strength from God, to do his will as becomes us.

Esaias 46, 10. Psalm. 103, 21.
The will of God here signifies: his commandments and decrees.

Romans 9, 19, 20.
(The will of God, none is able to resist, nor may plead against his doings).

The three foresaid petitions, belong only to the glory of God: and depend
together. For the name of the Lord is not hallowed, except his kingdom come:
and his kingdom does not come; except sin and wickedness be removed, and his
will be done.

Give us this day our daily bread.

Give us this day. etc. In this petition, under the name of Genesis 3, 19. deuteronomy.
8, 3. psalm. 37, 25, eze. 4, 16 and 5, 16. and 14, 13 mat. 4, 4. luke 4, 4.
bread; we pray for all such necessary things, which the use of our bodies (in
this life) needs: as food, raiment, health, peace, and such like. And so is
the name of bread used, in the holy Scripture.

Christ calls the bread which we must desire of God, Mat. 6, 11. 31, etc.
luke 11 3, psalm 34, 9, 16. pro. 30, 7, 8, 9.
Daily bread: because he will have every of us every day: to desire daily,
as much as may for every day, necessarily suffice us, in our vocation.

And having the same: that therewith 1, Tim. 6, ^ to 11, heb. 13, ^ iam, 4, 3.
we should be content. And this word Our bread: signifies that portion
that God has assigned unto us: and therefore we call it ours.

We must ask only; things necessary for our life: And to put our selves
wholly in the providence of God, to be nourished and mainteyned of him. 1, Chro.
29, 11, 12. iam. 1. 17
And acknowledge al things we have, to be given us by him.

So resting our selves on Gods providence, 2. These. 3, 1^ heb. 13, 5, 6.
and laboring diligently in our vocation: God will bless our labors, and
give us those things which Iam. 4, 3* 1, iohu 5, 14.
shall be needful for us (to serve God with: and our neighbor) according to
his will.

Touching Gods providence, See more a^ large before in the first Article of the
Creed.

We must ask the things which we shall need in this life, with this
condition annexed Deuteronomy. 6, ^6* mat. 4, 7, 1, cor. 10, 9.
If it be thy will: For we must not prescribe unto God, what he shall give
us: for that were to tempt God: which we are forbidden to do. But spiritual
blessings, we must ask without this condition, for they are profitable for us:
and may not any way hurt us.

The Pro. 30, 7. 8 9, Psa. 37. 16. 1. ^im. 6, 6, to 11.
abundance of riches may hurt us, if we have not Gods special grace to direct
us, in the good spending of them: For the rich men are gods stewardes, to
dispose them. Therefore if they do not use riches as God commands: their
sin is the greater by them.



And forgive us our trespasses. etc. In John 14, 13, 14. and 16, 23, 24. 1.
John 2, 12. and 5, 14.
this petition we pray: that our sins may be forgiven us, for Christ his
sake.

This petition teaches us to acknowledge our sins, and as earnestly as we
may, To desire of God forgiveness of them: trusting in his mercy, for the
merits, death, and passion of Christ Jesus our Savior and redemer.

Concerning forgiveness of sins, See is more as large before in the tenth
article of the Creed: and a^ the end of the Creed in the Conclusion.

As we forgive them. etc. Also these words, Matthew. 6, 14, 15, and 5, 23. 24 44,
luke 6. 36. ^ Iam. 2, 13, romans 12, 19. col, 3, 13.
As we forgive them that trespass against us: does admonish us, to forgive
our neighbor his offenses done to us. and that if we do not forgive our
neighbor, but seek revenge: God will not forgive us.

These words, As we forgine: does not signify the degree and comparison
between God and us* as if God should forgive so far and no more: then we
do forgive.

But these assures us, that God remitteth our sins, as truly and certainly:
as we forgive and remitte our neighbor. And that if we do not forgive our
neighbor, but seek revenge: God will no^ forgive us.

This provoke us to faith and true repentance: and to forgive and love our
neighbors. For we cannot pray in faith and true repentance, if we hate our
neighbor.



And lead us not into temptation. In praying that we be not Psalm 125, 5, and
81, 12, romans 1 24, 26. 2, these. 2, 11, 12. esaias, 63, 17. and 29, 10. 1, sam.
16, 14, john 14. 17. rom, 6. 12 2. cor. 4, 7, etc. 2. tim. 4, 18. 1, pet. 1, 5.
and 5, 8, 92, pet, 2, 9.
led into temptation, we desire that God will not withorawe his special grace
from us: but defend and uphold us with the power of his holy spirit, that we
may overcome all temptations; and thereby may be delivered from the consent,
and doing of evil.

When God 1, Sam, 16, 14 1. pet. 5, 8, 9. gal. 6, 1. 1, cor, 7, 5. romans 1, 24,
26. esaias 63, 17.
withdraws his special grace, in preserving and keeping us, by his holy
spirit: Then God suffers the devil, and our wicked inclinations to tempt
us, and to work us afflictions and troubles: thereby to exercise our faith; or
to chastise us for our sins. (For the Lord will 2. Tim: 3, 12, reave. 3, 19.
heb. 12, 6, etc. 1, these. 3, 3, 29. 2, cor, 7, 10 10. pro, 30. 9.
correct the offenses of the godly in this world, by afflictions: else our
flesh would be wanton, and forget God).

Therefore we pray, That he lead us not into temptation; That we should be
1, Cor. 10, 13
overcome of it, and so consent to the doing of evil: but that he will
deliver us from evil.

There are two sorts of temptations: The one is from God. The other is from
the devil, the wicked, and our corrupt inclinations.

The temptations whereby God tempts us; is a Iam, 1, 2, 3. 12, and 5, 10, 13.
1, pet, 4, 12, etc. deuteronomy. 8, 2. 2, cro. 32, 31. rom, 5, 3^ 5. 1, cor. 11, 10, 3^
trial and proof of our faith and obedience: that our faith, patience and
constancy, may be manifested unto our selves and unto men, to his glory and
praise; when he delivers us from that temptation and trial.

So were Genesis 22, 1, 2, 9. etc and 29, 7 etc. job 1, 7, etc, and 2. 1, cro. 21.
1. etc.
the temptations of Abraham, Joseph, Job, David: and other holy men.

The trial (or temptation) sent from God: is by afflictions and troubles (as
aforesaid) Ioh. 15, 5, 6,
which come on the godly, in that time that God withdraws his special grace
in preserving and keeping of them by his holy spirit. And then God Judge. 9, 25
suffers the wicked, and our evil inclinations, to tempt us, and to work us
afflictions and troubles: that we may resort (i) John 16, 20, 2, cor 4. 7,
etc. romans 8. 18 etc.
to his grace, and feel the presence of his strength in succouring of us. God
not working these afflictions, (for he Iam. 1. 13, 14, 15.
tempts none to evil) but only withdrawing his special grace for the time.
For where 1, Sam. 16, 24. heb. 3, 13. rom 8, 9. 1, pet. 5, 8, 9.
the spirit of Christ is absent: there will the wicked spirit be ready and
present, to work our destruction.

The Job 1. 7, to 13, and 2, mat. 8, 31. and 10, 29, 30
wicked spirits can do nothing unto the faithful, but what God shall suffer
them, and give them leave. For the Lord will have regard that those his
elect, shall not perish.

So Iud. 9, 23. 1. King. 22. 22. 2. King. 17, 27. and 24, 3.
the wicked do execute the judgments of God.

All things Romans 8. 28. Esa. 57, 1.
work for the best, to them that love God: for he knows what is best for
us. Also temptations are profitable for us, when his mercy does accompany
them.

We must not Mat. 4. 7. Wisd. 1. 2.
seek for afflictions: for so we shall tempt God, and provoke his wrath. But
those afflictions which be laid on the godly against their will: God in the
end, when it pleases him, 2. Pet, 2, 9, reave. 3, 10, 2* cor. 4. 7, etc. 1.
Cor, 10, 13.
will deliver the faithful out of those temptations: and will suffer no more
to be laid on them, Then he will give them strength to bear.

The temptation whereby the devil, How the devil tempts. Iam. 1. 13, 14. 15
1. Pet. 5. 8, 9.
the wicked, and our corrupt inclinations do tempt us; is every soliciting to
sin: To the end we may be withdrawn from God, and so to perish.

These are the diversities of temptations. The diversity of the temptations.
God tempts, only by the withdrawing of his special grace, to exercise the
faith of the godly, or to chasten them for their sins: holding them still in
his mercy, that they shall not perish: thereby to make them to resort to his
grace: and so to feel the presence of his strength in succouring them.

But the devil tempts; to withdraw 1. Pet. 5, 8. 9.
us from God: and enticeth and provoke us to do evil and wickedness, and
so to forsake God: that we might be destroyed and damned.

But deliver us from evil.

But deliver us from evil. In this we pray, That when temptations shall
assault us, and provoke us to do evil: that God John 17. 15.
would deliver us from all evil, present and to come. And that he will suffer
no evil to hurt us: but that all things may be unto our salvation.

We shall be led into temptations: Therefore we pray that we may not be 2.
Tim. 3, 12. 1, Pet. 5, 8, 9. 1, Cor. 10. 13.
overcome of them* and so to be withdrawn from God (but that we may be
delivered from evil).

FOr thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory for ever, Amen.

For thine is the kingdom, etc. This clause serves to confirm our faith:
That 1, Chr. 29, 10, 11 12 Psalm. 14 5, 13. 1. Tim. 1, 17. Reave, 5, 13. 1, Pet.
5, 11. Ephe. 3, 21. Col. 3. 17.
God is able to give us those things which we desire. For the kingdom, and all
power and glory, is his: therefore we trust in his power, mercy and
goodness. Unto this our God be all praise, glory, honor, power and thanks
(by Jesus Christ our Lord) for enermore.

Amen. This word (Amen) signifies: That we wish and desire, that it be so
done, (or so be it).

The effect of this prayer.
In the first petition, the Lord commands us to desire the true knowledge and
worship of God: In the second, That God would govern us with his spirit: and
so continually preserve and confirm us, in this knowledge. In the third: That
every of us (by the help of his holy spirit and government) may do and
fulfill our duty in our vocation: that we may do nothing against his will.
In the fourth: That God would give us corporal blessings; whereby every of us
may do his duty. In the fifth: That he would give us spiritual blessings, in
forgiving us our sins. In the sixth (and last) That we may be vpholden by
his grace: that thereby we may be delivered from all evil. And that so we
may be able to hallow, praise and glorify his name, through Christ our Lord
and Savior.

Before has been declared, three parts of Religion: faith? the law? and
prayer: now follows the last part, which is Sacraments.

Of Sacraments.
THe Sacraments which Mat. 28. 19. 20. Mark. 16, 16. Luke 22. 19. 20.
are to be used of us Christians: are only those which our savior Christ did
institute, and command us to use. Which are only two: Baptism and the Lords
Supper (which we commonly call the holy Communion).

These two Sacraments, Baptism, and the holy Communion, are holy signs:
ordained Genesis 17. 11. Romans 4. 11. Exodus 12. 14.
to be assured tokens and testimonies to me (and all the faithful) of the
mercy of God, and forgiveness of sins; for the merits, death and passion,
of Christ Jesus my savior. And with those holy Sacraments, I receive such
grace and virtue from Christ: the which my tongue cannot express. And the holy
Ghost by them, does move my heart to believe.

A Sacrament is a testimony of Gods A Sacrament what it is.
favor toward us: confirmed by an outward sign. Or a visible sign; of
invisible grace*

There are three things in a Sacrament. The first is the visible sign (as in
Baptism, water: and in the holy Communion, bread and wine): The second is,
the words of the Lords ordinance. And the third is, The thing signified by
them. The thing signified is Christ: for he is the substance of all Sacraments,
and they do promise nothing without him: For by Christ is the mercy of God
and salvation given unto us.

Our Savior Christ for the strengthening of our faith, has ordained the
preaching of the Gospel. And for the further increasing and confirming of our
faith: has instituted and left to be used of us for ever (so long as we are
in this world) the two Sacraments (aforesaid) Baptism, and the holy
Communion: to be testimonies of his grace and salvation.

These are called the Sacraments of the new Testament, because Christ did
institute them; and left them to be used of all Christians. And none other are
to be used of us as Sacraments, but those only.

The use of our Sacraments, are; to be Why the Sacraments were ordained.
signs and testimonies of the eternal covenant of remission of sins (or
promise of salvation) which God has made to the faithful in Christ. And also
serve to confirm our faith (for that they set before our eyes the good will of
our heavenly father) and lead us unto Christ; to seek our salvation only in,
and by him. And further, by receiving them, we testify our profession before
men: that we are Christians; not Infidels. Acts 10, 47.
And by them we bind our selves to God to follow godliness (in faith and
Romans 6, 3, 4. Ephe: 4, 3, to 7.
charity) and yield unto God obedience, praise and thanks for our
redemprion. And in giving us these visible signs: God testifyeth his benefits
toward us.

The Sacraments before Christ: Genesis 17, 4, 7, 10 21. 1, Cor. 10, 1, 2, 3, 4.
testified that Christ should come (for without Christ none was, nor never
shall be saved). And the Sacraments which Christ has left us; testify that
Christ is Mat. 28, 19, 20, 1, Cor. ^1, 26.
come: and are to us signs of the covenant of salvation (as aforesaid).

Christ teaches and instructs us with his word: then strengthens our
faith with sacraments: and by his holy spirit he opens our hearts to receive
the word and sacraments (which otherwise would nothing move our inward parts).
So without the work of the holy Ghost the sacraments do nothing at all
profit us. It is the spirit of God which is the author of the increase of
our faith* The office of the sacraments, The office of the Sacraments
is to set forth Christ unto us: and in him the treasures of heavenly grace.
And to confirm our faith, in setting before our eyes the good will of our
heavenly father. And by the healthful working of the holy Ghost the faithful
do receive with the sacraments; such grace and virtue from Christ our savior:
the which we are not able to express* And so that Note*
most learned man master Calvin writes in his book of institutions. If any
man ask me says M Calvin) what manner of presence of Christ is in the Lords
supper: I will not be ashamed to confess, that it is a higher secret then that
it can be either comprehended with my wit, or uttered with my words. And to
speak it more plainly, I rather feel it, then I can understand it. Therefore
I do here embrace the truth of God, wherein I may safely rest. With the holy
sacraments Christ with his spirit discendeth to the faithful. that he may
truly quicken their souls: Gal. 2. 20. Ephe. 3. 17. 2. Cor. 13. 5. 1. Cor. 6.
15, 17. 19. and 12. 13. Rom 8* 9. and 12, 5. 1. Cor. 10. 17. Ephe. 5. 30.
and dwell in them, and they in him? and they united to him, and made members
of his body* he being their head? and also members one of another by the
wonderful working of the holy Ghost. This secret uniting of Christ with the
godly, is by nature impossible to be comprehended.

For our instruction herein, behold Note.
the Sun shining forth his beams on the earth? how it is one thing in the
firmament: yet all the world, and every thing; is nourished and comforted with
the light and heat thereof. Much more (and more then may be expressed with
our tongues, or conceived in our minds) does the extending beams of the
spirit of Christ discende to the faithful, to quicken, comfort and defend
them: with the grace, virtue and power, that comes from the body of our
savior Christ Jesus: whereby they hate the devil and sin, and overcome them.

Albeit the faithful receive the benefits John 3. 18. 1. Pet. 3. 21. Acts 8.
13. 18. 20. 21. Ioh. 1, 33 Rom 2. 29. 1. Cor. 10. 4, 5.
aforesaid with the holy Sacraments: yet there is no such secret power knit
and fastened to the Sacraments, that they may of themselves, give us the graces
of the holy ghost.

The Sacraments do not profit us, unless the holy ghost join with them: for
it is the holy ghost, that increases and strengthens our faith, and makes
the Sacraments to bring forth fruit in us. We do not deny, but Christ
himself, Matthew. 28. 20.
with the power of his spirit is present at the administration of the holy
Sacraments: and the grace of God is there truly present to our faith, when we
receive them. Nevertheless, the inward grace of the spirit, is severed from
the outward ministry. And the Sacraments do not profit, but being received
by faith.

All that are baptized have not the spirit of Christ. Simon Magus* was
baptized Acts 8. 13. 18, to 25.
(by Philip the Apostle) but had not the grace of the holy ghost: he confessed
the truth, yet was not regenerate by the holy ghost. So Baptism and the Lords
supper, may be received without the holy ghost: Albeit God inwardly works by
the holy ghost? that which the Sacraments testify.

He that despises the holy sacraments, and willingly does forbear the Genesis
17, 13, 14. Luke 14, 24. Mar. 8, 38.
use of them, as though he needed them not: he is not to be accounted any of
Gods people. And also thereby he refuses the grace of Christ. But he that
receives John 3, 16. and 17, 20, etc.
them in faith and repentance: unto him the holy Sacraments seal and confirm
most assuredly, the promise of 1. John 2, 3, Romans 3, 25. and 5 9, 2. cor. 5,
21. Gal 3, 1^. heb. 9, 14. and 10, 10. Col 1, 14.
grace, and forgiveness of sins: and that he shall be partaker of Christ
and his benefits, and dwell with him in heaven for ever.

Of Baptism.
Baptism is a holy sign, and an assured Mark, 16, 16. Tit. 3, 5. Gal 3, 27.
1. Cor. 12, 13.
token to me: that my sins are forgiven me for Christ his sake: and that I
am received into the holy Church, as a member of the same: and united unto
Christ, by the special working of the holy Ghost.

Baptism has the promise of forgiveness Matt. 28, 19. Mark, 16, 16. Romans 6,
3. Tit. 3, 5. 1. Pet 3, 21.
of sins and salvation, annexed to it: that every one which believes and is
baptized, shall be saved. And in Baptism we are renewed by the holy Ghost:
whereby our evil inclinations are changed into good, that we have thereby an
hatred of sin.

In Baptism the offense and punishment Gal. 3, 27. Ephe. 5, 26. Tit. 3, 5. 1.
Pet. 3, 21.
of our sin is taken away. Nevertheless, the corruption or inclination to
sin, remains in us: which makes every one of us subject to sin, and
always, to need the mercy of God, and 1. John 1, 8, 9, 10
forgiveness of sins.

Baptism is a ceremony, or outward What Baptism is: and wherefore it was
ordained.
sign, instituted by Christ: being washed with water in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. Whereby Christ testifyeth 1.
John 1, 7. Ephe. 5. 26.
to us, that we are cleansed from our sins by his blood. And Baptism is
also a solemn sign of our receiving into the holy Church: and the mark
whereby Christians are known, from Infidels. Also it is the Sacrament Acts 2,
38.
of Christian profession: for by my receiving of Baptism, I do profess 2.
Cor. 5, 17. Romans 6, 3, 4.
to live a Christian: and to believe and trust for my salvation (and all things
else which I shall need) only, in the name of the father, the son, and the
holy ghost (three persons and one true and everlasting God). And I do thereby
solemnly bind my self to Christ, to keep his commandments (to my power)
and to believe and trust in his merits, death and passion, for my salvation.
And so by Acts 22. 16. and 15 9. Mar. 16*. 16. Tit. 3. 5.
faith in Christ, I am sanctified by the spirit: unto eternal life.

The visible sign in Baptism, is water, with which the person baptized is
washed.

The spiritual and invisible grace is: 1. Cor. 6, 1 1. Tit. 3. 5.
forgiveness of sins, and the renewing by the holy ghost. After our Baptism,
Christ with his grace, by the working of the holy ghost? does regenerate, and
frame the faithful, to newness of life, by faith and repentance (so long as
they live here in this world) whereby they hate sin and the devil: and in
the end overcome them.

To be baptized in the name of the father, the son* and the holy ghost:
signifies into the Religion, profession and grace? of the father, the son,
and the holy ghost Baptism is the solemn receiving of us into the holy
Church, and into Gods favor* therefore every of us are but once baptized in
our whole life.

Although our baptism do require Baptism of infants.
faith and repentance: yet the Baptism of infants does very well agree with
the institution of Christ, and the nature of the sign. For the signs consist
not in the outward ceremonies: but principally Acts 2. 39. Gal. 3, 7. 29. Genesis
17, 7. 1. Cor. 12. 13.
depend upon the promise of salvation, which belong also to the children of
the faithful: and we and our children by baptism enter into the profession
of God; that we may be reckoned his people. Also Baptism has the same office
with us, as Circumcision had with the Jews. (And God commanded the Jews to
circumcise their infants). Infants Mat. 19, 14. 15. mar. 10. 14. 15. 16. Gal.
3. 29.
are partakers of Christ, and heirs by promise: Therefore are not to be
debarred from baptism.

The children of Christians are accounted holy: although they be the 1. Cor,
7, 14.
issue, but of one faithful parent. Therefore the child of a Christian may
be baptized. The Prophet Jeremy, and saint John Baptist, were sanctified in
Iere. 1, 5. Luke 1, 15.
their mothers wombes: whereby plainly appears, salvation is according to
Gods election: albeit the infant were Tit. 3. 5. 2, These. 2. 13
never baptized. God has chosen us before the foundation of the world. So
then salvation is not in him that wills, Ephe. 1. 4. Romans 9, 16,
nor in him that runs: but in God that shows mercy.

Of the holy Communion.
THe holy Communion I receive in remembrance, Luke 22. 19, 20 1. Cor. 11, 24.
25 26. Romans 4, 25.
that Christ dyed for my sins: and rose again to give me (and all the
faithful) eternal life. And in this holy Sacrament (receiving the same in
true faith and repentance) I receive (by the 1. Cor. 13, 2, 3.
working of the holy Ghost) grace and virtue from heaven: from the very body
and blood of our Savior Jesus Christ (for out 1. Cor. 10, 3, 4, 16, 17. gal.
2, 20 John 6, 51, etc.
of the substance of his flesh, he gives life to my soul) and the holy Ghost
does thereby nourish my heart to believe faithfully in Christ his death and
merits for my salvation: and dwells in me; and unites me unto Christ. And
also makes me 1. Cor. 6, 15, 17 19 2, Cor. 13. 5. Romans 8. 9.
partaker of Christ his benefits: And after this life, to have eternal in
heaven with Christ Jesus my Savior.

In this holy Sacrament we are made 1. Cor. 10. 17. Romans 12, 5.
members of Christ, and united together: by his holy Spirit dwelling in us.
The Ephe. 5, 30, 32.
manner of Christ his presence, and of our uniting, and how we eat Christ
and drink his blood; is a great secret: and more then my tongue can express,
or any man's mind able to conceive.

When we receive this holy Sacrament: Col. 3, 1.
we must (as devoutly as we can) lift up our minds into heaven, where Christ
is: And by our faith, receive Gal. 2 20. Ephe. 3, 17. John 3, 16, and 5 24.
ephe. 2, 8, and 3, 17. acts 10, 43 and 26, 18, and 15, 9. gal. 5, 6. Heb, 11, 6.
grace and virtue from his very body. By our true and lively faith, we are
made partakers of Christ, and united to him, by his spirit dwelling in us: and
do obtain remission of our sins, and salvation.

At the receiving of this holy Sacrament Matthew 28, 20. John 17* 22, 23. 2. Cor.
13. 5. Romans 12, 5.
Christ is present (by the working of his holy spirit): and does make us one
with him; and members one of another.

And we be partakers of the godly nature: 2. Pet. 1, 4.
in that we flee the corruption, which is in this world through lust.

Every one which receives this holy Sacrament 1, Cor, 13, 2, 3.
worthily (in true faith, repentance 1. Cor. 10. 3. 4. John 6. 54. to 57, 63 2.
cor. 13 5. 1. cor. 6. 15, 17 19. Rom 8. 9. and 12, 5. ephe. 5, 30 1. Cor. 10,
17.
and charity) do then receive the body of Christ (working by his spirit) and
forgiveness of all their sins.

Christ then dwells in them, and they in him: and are united to him, and made
members of his body, and also members one of another: by the secret and
marvelous working of the holy Ghost.

Christ does out of the substance of Gal. 2. 20. Romans 8. 9. 10. 11
his flesh, give life unto our souls. And we do live, by his holy spirit and
virtue abiding in us. And by that virtue and power we do hate sin, and the
devil, and over come them.

Thus are the faithful f^d with Christ John 14, 23. 1. John 3, 24, and 4. 13.
Ephe. 3, 17. 2. Cor. 1, 22. Romans 8. 11.
his body, and do live by his holy spirit and virtue abiding in them. And
thereby their faith is nourished and strength^ned: and their souls fed with
this spiritual food (in Christ) unto eternal life. This is our communion
with Christ: and the eating of his body, and the drinking of his blood. Thus
by our true faith, and the working of the holy ghost, we are made his members
and members one of another; and so one body in Christ: he being our head, from
whom we all, Romans 12. 5. Col. 1, 18, to 2^
do draw of his fullness. So we eat Christ in such sort; as he abides in
us.

The manner of the receiving of this grace and virtue; and the incorporating
Ephe. 5, 30, 32*
of the faithful into Christ, is a great secret: and more then our tongues
can express, or our minds able to conceive.

This holy Sacrament (which some call the Lords supper: others, the holy
Communion of the body and blood of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, and
commonly the holy Communion). Christ did institute (and ordeyne) at his Mat.
26, to 31. Mar. 14, 22. to 26. Luke 22, 19, 20
last supper with his disciples. Which institution saint Paul expounds and
declares in these words following.

I have received of the Lord that 1. Cor. 11, 23, to 30.
which I also have delivered unto you. That the Lord Jesus in the night he was
betrayed, took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it and said.
Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you: this do ye in
remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had
supped, saying: This cup is the new testament in my blood: This do as often
as ye drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as ye shall eat this
bread, and drink this cup: ye show the Lords death till he come. Let a
man therefore examine him self, and so let him eat of this bread, and drink
of this cup. For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks
his own damnation: because he discerns not the Lords body.

Further, Saint Paul says, The ^. Cor. 10, 16, 17
cup of blessing which we bless: is it not the Communion of the blood of
Christ? The bread which we break: is it not the communion of the body of
Christ? For we that are many, are one bread, and one body: because we all ar^
partakers of one bread.

Note that as the bread is Christ's body: So is the cup the new Testament. The
new Testament is the promise of salvation made to all beleuers in Christ.
Therefore the eating of Christ's body is spiritual, and so says Saint Paul.
1. Cor. 10, 1, 2, 3, 4.

This form and order of the Lords Supper we ought to hold, and wholly to keep:
for the remembrance of his death and benefits, till he come again at the end
of the world to judgment.

THis holy sacrament, is a distributing The holy Sacrament what it is: and
wherefore ordained.
of sanctified bread and wine in the assembly of the faithful (according to
the commandment of Christ): To testify that he has delivered his body to
death, and shed his blood, for our redemption.

The visible signs of the Lords supper are bread and wine. The things
signified, is the breaking of Christ's body (by the separation of his soul from
his body) and the shedding of his blood: for our redemption. And also our union
with christ: that Christ makes the faithful pertakers of his body and blood,
as surely and verily as they receive the sanctified bread and wine. And that
the remembrance thereof with praise and thanks unto Christ for the same; is
unto our souls Romans 8, 11*
spiritual meat: and nourishment and strengthening unto our faith. So the
invisible grace in this Sacrament is Christ himself.

This holy Sacrament was instituted and 1. Cor. 11. ^6. Suke 22, 19.
appointed to be done of all the faithful, in remembrance of Christ his
death, and the benefits we receive thereby. And that we should publicly
declare and confess (till he come again to judge) that all our trust for
eternal life and salvation; is in his death and merits.

Also this holy Sacrament is appointed Heb. 13. 15. 1. Cor. 10, 31. Ephe. 5,
20. Col. 3, 17.
to be a ceremony of praise and thanksgiving. And that in celebrating it in
our assemblies, we do with praise and continual thanks, glorify Christ: and
give him thanks for his death and passion.

Further, it is a token, of the union we 1. Cor. 10, 17. Ephe 4, 4, 5, 6. Romans
12, 5.
have with Christ: and is the bond of love amongst us Christians. For we that
are many, are one body in Christ, united together by the power of the holy
ghost; Christ being our head, and we his members.

And also the receiving of this holy 1. Cor. 11, 26. 1, Cor. 10, 17. Ephe. 4.
3, to 8. Col. 3, 17. 1. These. 5, 18.
Sacrament, is a public confession of our faith: and a solemn binding of our
selves, to lead a Christian life in faith and charity (with continual praise
and thanks to Christ for our redemption).

THe wicked do not eat the body of 1. Cor. 10, 21. John 15, 1, to 8.
Christ: for Christ does not dwell in them. And in whom Christ does not abide*
without doubt is not partaker of Romans 8, 9. mat. 5, 23, 24
Christ his body, nor any member of him albeit he eat the sanctified bread
and wine: which is the sign of his body and blood). He that eats Christ;
dwells in Christ: and Christ in him.

(The wicked which are known: are to John 6, 56. 1. Cor. 5, 9, etc. Mat. 18,
17. 1. Cor. 10, 21.
be excluded from this holy Sacrament, until they show their true says, by
godly repentance).

THerefore they which come to this 1. Cor. 11, 28. 2, Cor. 13, 5.
holy Supper: must examine and prove themselves if they have faith and
repentance, and do faithfully believe, that they are delivered from damnation;
by the only mercy of God: for the merits death and passion of Christ Jesus
our savior. And must desire to profit and go forward in godliness and
newness of life. And so to show forth the Mat. 5, 23, ^4. 2, Cor. 7, 10. 1.
Cor. 13, 2, 3. Gal. 5, 6.
death of the Lord* in faith and repentance, by their godly life, being
heartily sorry for their sins: and to be in charity with all men.

He that says he believes, and do ^. John 4, 20. ^. Tim. 3, 5. Tit. 1, 16.
not show it, in his life and doings; is a liar: and by his evil doings he
denies the power of godliness. Such persons profess they know God: but by
their evil works they deny him: and unto every good work reprobate. Saint
Paul commands us to withdraw our selves 2. These. 3, 6. 14. 1. Cor. 5. Romans
16, 17. 2. Pet. 2. 20. 21. 22. Mat. 12, 45. Reave. 2. 5. and 3, 16.
from such, and have no company with the^ that they may be ashamed. That they
and every of them may remember from whence they are fallen, and repent.

In baptism we are received into the church: therefore this is but once to be
done in all our life. The Lords supper is a confirming of our faith, and feding
of our souls, and must be often done: to declare the Lords death (as
aforesaid)* and is to be done not to one alone, but in the assembly of the
faithful when they meet^ 1. Cor. 10, 17. and 11. 26.
together.

He that has true faith is fed with Christ: to be saved body and soul unto
eternal life. To whom be all praise, honor, glory, power and thanks for ever.

Amen.
The conclusion and sum of this Book.
THose things which are before written, Of the holy^ Trinity: and Gods
providence.
consists briefly in this: That the Almighty God, and his fullness (which
is, the Almighty power, that made Heaven and earth) That the same God dwells
and abides bodilye in Christ Jesus. And that this holy Spirit (the Almighty
power) which proceeds from Christ: defends and keeps us, from the power
of Satan: and preserves all the faithful to everlasting life.

Also that we believe to be saved only Of faith.
by the mercy of God: for the merits, death and passion of Christ Jesus our
Savior. And that therefore God will hear our prayers, be merciful unto us,
and forgive us our sins. And after our lives here ended (at the time
appointed for the Resurrection) Christ will raise these our vile bodies, out of
the dust: joining again to them our souls: and will then make the bodies of
the faithful, like unto his glorious body: to live in heaven with him for
ever.

Further, That the holy Sacraments Of Sacraments.
of Baptism and the Lords Supper, are holy signs: ordained to be assured
tokens to all the faithful; of the mercy of God, by Christ. And that we do
receive with them, by the working of the holy Ghost; such good benefits and
graces from Christ Jesus: the which our tongues cannot express.

Matthew, 28, 19, 20. Luke 22, 19, 20. 1. Cor. 10, 16. 17. John 6, 63. Gal. 2,
20. Romans 8, 9. Tit. 3, 4, to 8. 2, Pet. 1, 3, 4, 5.

And also, That whosoever has this Of the life of a Chistian.
assured faith; shall be saved. And that he which has this faith, will love
Christ his Savior: and will have a continual fervent and earnest desire to
keep his commandments: And having sufficient to mainteyne his family (for
that he which does not provide for them, has denied the faith, and is worsse
then an infidel) will also to his power: comfort, help and relieve with his
goods, his needy neighbors and brethren in Christ. And (continually strive
with himself against his wicked nature) to do unto others: as he would they
should do unto him.

John 17, 3 and 14, 15, etc. 1. John 3, 23, 24. Romans 7, 14, etc. and 6, 12, 16,
and 8, 1, 2. 1. Tim. 5, 8, 1, John 4, 20. 21. Iam. 2, 17, 26, Mat. 7. 12.

So the whole life of a Christian is: to believe and trust in Christ for
salvation, (and all things else) loving him above all things. And to receive
the holy Sacraments; and love one another: as Christ has commanded. 1. John
3, 23, 24. Gal. 5. 6. 14.

Eschew evil: and do good.
What Christ has commanded, that we should do: what he has forbidden, that
should we not do.

The sum of the holy scriptures is the Law and the Gospel. The Law teaching
us what we ought to do. And the Gospel shows us the promises of God in
Christ: and teaches us faith and charity.

The whole duty of man is: fear Eccles. 12. 13. Pro. 8, 8. 13.
God, and keep his commandments. (The fear of the Lord, is to hate evil).
And the duty of a christian is, to know what Christ has taught: and to do
thereafter (and fulfill it) to his power. Love Christ above all: and thy
neighbor as thy self: this is the sum of christianity.

The Lord for his mercy, direct us ever in his truth: and that directly, and
only, we may all seek Gods glory. Now unto the king everlasting, immortal,
invisible, unto God only wise: be honor 1. Tim. 1. 17.
and glory for ever and ever.

Amen.

Daily lessons to be observed of every Christian.
1 EVery morning and evening, and at thy meals: pray unto God, and give him
thanks for his benefits, and be sorry for thy sins. And always when thou art
tempted to evil, then think on Gods commandment concerning that matter: and
the godly fear to break that commandment, will overcome that temptation. For
the remembrance of God puts away evil.

2 Begin nothing before thou know, how to finish the same: and consider well of
the end that may come thereof. Trust not to much to thine own wit.

3 Rule thy tongue, that it run not before thy wit: but let thy mind rule thy
tongue. (First think and then speak: for words spoken have power over the
speaker). Affirm nothing before thou know the truth: nor believe any thing
rashly. Refrain from foul language.

4 If thou will correct any man, do it with gentleness. Be gentle in thy
behavior, and familier in thy communication.

5 Promise with good consideration, (knowing first how to perform it) and
when thou have promised, perform it faithfully. Requite benefits, for it is
due to render deserved thanks.

6 Use no familiarity with any vicious person: and beware of liers and
flatterers.

7 When thou will ask counsel: ask it of him that gouernes himself
honestly. And make no furious man, dronkard, nor vicious person of thy counsel.

8 Do not that thy self, which thou dispraysest in another.

9 Eschew idleness: and be not ignorant in those things, which is a shame to
thee, not to know. Use diligence, and do not that to morrow, which thou may
(well and lawfully) do the same day.

10 It is more surer for thee to pardon, then to revenge: for every revenge
ministers occasions of further cruelty. Therefore seek to live in peace with
all men: and meddle not with those matters which perteyne not to thee. Be slow
to wrath, hate cruelty, and in thy fury subdue thine affections. Be not
hasty, nor wrathful: for those be the conditions of a fool. (Hastiness
causes repentance: and frowardness hinderance.)

11 Use measure in all things: for temperance calls a man back from all
evil affections. Temperate sparing, is good gayning (for small expenses often
used, consume great substance).

12 Remember what thou art: and what thou shall be. and think nothing
profitable, which is not honest and godly. Live honestly, hurt no man, and give
to every man his due. Eschew evil and do good, and God will bless thee.

Give glory, praise and thanks: unto Christ our Savior. So be it.
