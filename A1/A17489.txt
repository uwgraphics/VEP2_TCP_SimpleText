ECCLESIAS 38.4. The Lord has created medicine of the earth, and he that is
wise will not abhor it. Imprinted at London for Edward White, at the little
Northdore of Paul's Church, at the sign of the Sun, and are there to be
sold. 1579.

To all such Readers as have care of their bodylie health.
How prouidente a Patron, and bountiful a father, the Lord of life is unto
us unthankful and rebellious children, his manifold benefits, do testify:
Yea, the continuance of his kindness is herin principally declared. For
whereas our own natural corruption, woorketh daily in us the banishment out
of his favor, and the danger of reprobation: He notwithstanding, in
consideration of our weakness, with draws not his compassion from us, but
in all our necessities, reachyng out his helpyng hand unto us, is most ready
(as he is always able) to pluck us out of the pit of perdition, whereinto
the heinousness of our transgressions (as it were with a gab^e,) haleth us
perforce. O gracious God, how shall sinners worthily advance the excellency
of thy love? Who shall give them an heart to conceive thy kindness? Whence
shall they have utterance to sound out thy mercy: Of themselves (because they
are vessels of wrath) they cannot compass to perfect a work: thou
therefore which art the perpetual spring of all goodness, give it them: O
give it them, and they shall have it: yea and in the having of it, they shall
magnify thy name, extol thy power, and marvel at thy mercy. Where is one,
among thousand thousands, that looking upon the Heavens, most gloriously
beautified: upon the earth, most plentifully enriched, upon the frame of his
own body, most Angelically created: but shall of compulsion acknowledge the
omnipotency of God, and confess the unmeasurable greatness of his goodness,
and love toward man: The Heaven, to maintain life and light: the Earth, to
succoure and sustain Nature; all creatures, living in land or water, to
supple his wantes: nothing to be reckoned and named, which he has not most
liberally given unto man, as appointyng him Lord and sovereign, but them his
vessels and servants. Against hunger, least thou should famishe, he
has provided nourishment. Against thirste, least thou should perish, he
has ordained fauourie Liquours. Against cold, least thou should dye in
thy nakedness, he has given thee clothing. And what has he done beside:
Has he not had special regard to thy condition and estate: I mean to the
health of thy vndie, and the safety of thy soul* Yes, yes: and that is
evidently proved by the manifold remedies which he has prepared to restore
thee to soundenesse of limu^e and life, and by the free course of the pearl of
his Gospel, which is the Jewel of all Christian joy. In consideration of
these so many good graces of God, what does Christian duty require: (I
speak to all, unto whose veiwe and censure this preface shall be presented.)
Let them take the sweet Sacrifice of thankfulness, and burn the same upon
the Alter of an humble heart, that the redolent and perfumed incense of the
same ascendyng up into Heaven, may smell sweet in his nostriles, whose
special delighte is in such a burnte offering and oblation. Thus much have I
said by way of advertisement, upon occasion of this present book, whose
benifittes as they are diverse, so are they singular: and in them all is Gods
goodness highly commended. Note my words, and then judge of the value and
worthiness of the book. Art thou diseased in thy head: Art thou grieved in
thy heart: Art thou payned with ache* Art thou tormented with a Fever: Art
thou wounded: Art thou troubled with any yrkesome sore: Does thy sight fail:
Does thy hearing ware weak: Does thy youth wear away: Does age creep on a
pace: Finally, do thou feel thy self infected with the poison of the
Plague and Pestilence: Then delaie no time, but with a small price buy a gemme
worth gold, (this book I mean) which though it be little in quantity, yet
it is great in quality and virtue. Here (as in a cunning Apothecaries shop
(are receiptes of sundry sorts provided, where with the rage of any sore may
be mittigated, the nippyng smarte of any vlcere or wound assuaged, the venom
of any malady expelled: and the perfection of health restored. Thus much in
brief, by a souden blushe judge of the rest, esteem it as it is, a necessary
implemente for any householder, yea in the next degree to our daily food and
nourishment to be esteemed. Thank God for it, and use it in thy need. Here
thou have succor to serve thee in thy sickness.

Thus farewell in Christ. T. C.
