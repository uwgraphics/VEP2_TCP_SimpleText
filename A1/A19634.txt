TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL SIR ARTHVR CAPELL Knight, his singular good Patron,
the Author wishes, what the work describes.
TO whom, under Christ, should I render this account of my poor labors in my
charge, but unto your self, Right worshipful; by whose means the Lord
vouchsafed me so free and comfortable an entrance therein to? It is the Lord
Jesus, the door of the sheep, of whom you have obtained this mercy, rather
to be, among few, a faithful dorekeeper in his house; then to dwell, with
many, in the Simoniacall tabernacles of wickedness. Neither shall it ever
repent you, that you have not drunk of those stolen waters, or rather of that
blood of souls; wherewith too many, in these gold-thirstie days, do
purchase Aceldama unto them and theirs. Let others enrich themselves with the
wages of unrighteousness; let them make their boast of their covetous desire,
and bless themselves in their contempt of the Lord: but let the Lord keep this
for ever in the purpose of the hearts of his servants, to deal faithfully and
vprightlie in so honorable and weighty a trust. And let such as have found
this blessing, in these corrupt days, to have a free access to the work and
charge of the ministry, thankfully acknowledge the same both to God and man.
Amongst whom I gladly profess my self to be one; and therefore, to the
honor of God, and the just acknowledgement of your Christian integrity, I
commend this work to your worthy name and Patronage: your example to the
memory and imitation of posterity: and your self with all your Worshipful
family, to the holy direction and safe tuition of Almighty God.

Your worships in Christ ever bounden, SAM. CROOK.

TO THE CHRISTIAN READERS, especially those of my charge the inhabitants of
Wrington in Somersetshire.
Christian Reader,
Blessedness is the Alpha and Omega of Man, the beginning of nature, and the
end of Grace. The natural Philosopher in his inquest of Happiness lays this
ground, Arist. Ethi^. lib. 1. cap. 1
that, All things desire that which either in truth or in opinion is good for
them; and that only is good, which tends unto the only good, the uttermost
end and perfection of their several natures. But where Philosophy ends
Religion begins: or rather, where Reason fails Grace supplies, proclaiming all
that nature (in the blindness of Corruption) accounts excellent to be vanity
of vanities; Eccl. 1.2.
and the end of all and whole of man, Eccl. 12.13, 14.
to be the fear of God, and the keeping of his Commandments. And that with
respect to the last Judgment, wherein all works of men, whether good or
evil, though never so secret, shall come to light and trial, and receive
their due reward. Yea so far was nature in staken in the matter of
Blessedness, that it could not truly define so much as the happiness and
perfection of the brute creature; which the Scripture shows to be the
Revelation and glorious Redemption of the Sons of God. Romans 8.19, 21.
Wherefore as it is evident in nature that all men seek blessedness: so it is
apparent in experience, that there is no man that can attain thereto without a
supernatural guide; without which, we see that touching Blessedness, there
are as many minds as men, and as many ways as wits; every one crossing
another, and so all proving that all are insufficient.

For this cause I have framed this Treatise, for a direction to that, which all
men seek, and so few find. Wherein from the ground of nature, Ioh. 1.9.
as of that light which enlightneth every man that comes into the world, I
endeavor to raise the building of saving knowledge.

Although (to speak properly) the light of nature shows rather the
necessity then the way to saving knowledge, and is a ground rather of
inquiry, then of attaining thereto. For all that nature can truly determine,
and articulatelie pronounce concerning this matter, is, that Blessedness is to
be sought, and such a blessedness, as may sort with the nature of man the
seeker; especially in regard of his better part, which is his soul. The rest
well may she stammer at; as that the soul is not only a reasonable, but also
a religious and immortal spirit, and therefore cannot be blessed without the
everlasting fellowship and favor of God, to whom she is by band of conscience
obliged: But plainly to utter these (more then metaphysicall) trueths, is of
such only, whose tongue-string is loosed, and to whom the Lord has said,
Ephphata, be opened. Mar. 7.34 35.
And with this help, Reason it self will yet go further, and say, that the
means of acquaintance and fellowship with God, can be no other, then those
which himself affords, and namely his Word, the only infallible Index of
the mind of the speaker; and therefore it cannot but reject, as uncertain and
unsafe, whatsoever the presumptuous boldness of flesh and blood obtrudeth
against, or besides this rule.

And yet further touching the trial of this touchstone, whether it be the word
of God or no, Reason it self will acknowledge, that (whatsoever inducements
may be from the authority of those whom we credit and respect) none but God
himself can thoroughly resolve us of it: and that either by the apparent
traces of divine majesty in the letter of the Scripture; or by the secret
testimony of the same Spirit that inspired it, inclining the heart of the
reader or hearer to embrace and subscribe unto the authority of it. So that
now the true believer may say unto the Church as those Conuerts to the woman of
Samaria, Now we believe not because of thy saying, Ioh. 4.42.
for we have heard him our selves.

Unto reason thus enlightened or willing thus to be enlightened, I hope my
manner of proceeding in this Treatise will seem reasonable; wherein I have
with the uttermost of my poor ability faithfully endeavored to comprise the
whole body of the heavenly doctrine of the Scriptures: and that in such a
method, as upon long and serious pensitation, I have judged most meet, to
bring light to the matter, and ease, both for understanding and memory, to the
Reader.

A subject, I grant, not of so pleasing a strain either to the writer or to
the reader, as some other treatises which afford more liberty of invention and
discourse. But I have learned of the blessed Apostle of the Gentiles, Phil. 3.1.
not to be grieved to write these same (seeming triuiall) things unto you;
knowing that even from these things is the experience best taken of Christ
speaking in the Minister (and therefore even from these points does the same
Apostle avouch his understanding in the mystery of Christ) and withal being
assured, that for you it is a sure course, 2. Cor. 13.3.
Ephesians. 3.4.
to be always put in remembrance of these things, 2. Pet. 1.12
though ye have knowledge, and be established in the present truth.

The experience of eleven years has taught me, that it is not enough to teach
in public, unless the auditors have care to instruct themselves, and one
another privately at home. For which purpose, I have framed this Treatise by
way of Question and answer, a way most familiar for instruction, and whereby
the spirit both of the answerer, and of all that attend, is stirred up to
bethink themselves, what might be most aptly answered, to the Question
propounded. Neither have I done this only in the larger Treatise; but also
extracted an Abridgement of the substance thereof, in a far briefer draught,
for the private use of Christian families, and help of the weaker sort; that
becoming all things to all men, 1. Cor. 9.22.
I might by all means save some.

Wherefore as I have out of my penury cast in all that I had, Luc. 21.4.
even these two mites, into the treasury of the Church; So I earnestly desire
thee, Christian Reader (especially you that are of my charge, beloved in our
Lord Jesus, to whom as my labors are principally due, and most familiar, so
from you above others, I expect this Retaliation) to employ this our Lords
talent, now in thy hands, for thine own best advantage, and of those that are
committed unto thee by the Lord.

So shall thou settle thy self, and them, upon the ground of saving truth. So
shall thou be prepared to give answer to every man, 1. Pet. 3.15.
that shall ask of thee a reason of the hope that is in thee. So shall thou be
able, to make far greater and sweeter benefit of whatsoever thou shall hear
out of the word preached; which unto those that are ignorant of the grounds of
Religion, Esa. 8.6.
or despise these waters of Shiloah, because they run softly, is many times
unprofitable and unsavory. So shall thou not be plucked away with the error
of the wicked (whose itching ears, 2. Pet. 3.17, 18. 2. Tim. 4.3. 2. These.
2.10. 2. Cor. 11.3.
and hearts not loving the truth, are easily corrupted from the simplicity that
is in Christ) and so fall from thine own steadfastness: but grow in grace, and
in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Finally, Gal. 6.16.
walking according to this rule, peace shall be upon thee, and mercy, as upon
the Israel of God.

Thine in the common faith, and service of our Lord Jesus, SAM. CROOK.

THE GVIDE UNTO TRVE BLESSEDNESS.
SECTION I. Of man's happiness, in acquaintance with God, making himself known
to us in his word, written.
Question. WHat is it that all men do, and ought chiefly to desire?

Answer. That, being to live a while in this world, and for ever in another,
they may be, both here and hereafter, Number. 23.10 Psalm. 106 4, 5
truly blessed.

Q. Wherein consists this true blessedness of man?

A. Not in Eccle. 1.2.
himself, nor in any other created thing, but only in Psalm. 37.4 and 73.25.
God his Creator, who alone, being infinite, is able to fill the heart of man.

Q. How may man find happiness in God?

A. By Job. 22.21
acquaintance, and fellowship with him, who is the fountain of blessedness:
Joh. 17.3 Gal. 4.9.
so knowing him, or rather being known of him, that he may Eccl 12.13.
serve him, and be 2 Cor 5 9
accepted of 1. Sam. 2.30
him, honor him, and be honored by him.

Q. God being invisible, how may we come to know him?

A. The invisible things of God are revealed unto mankind, partly by his Ps 19
1 etc Romans 1.20
works, to leave all without excuse, but chiefly by his Psa. 19.7. etc. Job
22.22 Ioh. 6 68
word to guide us to salvation.

Q. Where is that saving word of God to be had?

A. In the writings of the holy Prophets and Apostles, commonly called the Joh.
5.39 2. Tim. 3.15
Scriptures of the old and new Testament.

Q. Is there not also an unwritten word of God?

A. No For howsoever Heb. 1.1 Number. 12.6.
at the first the whole word of God was delivered without writing, by immediate
revelation or tradition, yet since that Exo. 34.27
God commanded the Scriptures to be written, the Church has been Esaias 8.20
Luc. 16.29, 31
directed unto the Scriptures only for the saving knowledge of God.

Q. By whom was this word written?

A. 1 The old Testament by Moses, and the Romans 3.2
Prophets, who delivered the same unto the Church of the Jews. 2 The new
Testament by the Apostles and Evangelist, Romans 1.16 Reu. 1.11.
by whom it was delivered to the Church of the Gentiles.


Q. In what language did they write?

A. In the language best known unto the Church: the Prophets in Hebrew, the
Apostlos in Greek. In which tongues only they are, for the letter, to be held
authentical.

Q. What shall we think of the books called Apocrypha?

A. That they are books, of good use and esteem in the Church, for direction
of manners; but not to be acknowledged as rules of faith; since they were
neither written in Hebrew, the language of the Church before Christ, nor ever
received into the Canon of Scripture by them, Rom 3.2.
to whom alone, in those times, the Oracles of God were committed.

Q. Seeing the Apostles and Prophets were men, how can their writings be
accounted the word of God?

A. Because they proceeded 2. Pet. 1.20 21.
not from the will or mind of man, but holy men of God spoke and wrote as they
were moved by the holy Ghost: in which regard the 2. Tim. 3.16
whole Scripture is said to be by divine inspiration.

Q. How may it appear that the Scriptures were inspired by God?

A. 1 By the testimony of the Church, both before Christ and since. 2 By
arguments vn-answerable, taken from the antiquity, the majesty of the style,
the truth of prophecies etc. 3 And most effectually, by the testimony of the
same holy spirit, that inspired them, 1. Cor. 2 10 and 14.37 1. Ioh 2, 20.
who inclines our hearts to believe what is revealed in them.


Q. Are the Scriptures plain, and easy to be understood?

A. 1 Unto those 2. Cor. 3.4
whose eyes the God of this world has blinded, 2. Pet. 3.5. Ioh. 8.43.
all things in Scripture, belonging to the saving knowledge of God, are dark
and difficult. 2 But unto such as are by grace Ps. 119.18
enlightened, and made willing to understand, howsoever 2. Pet. 3.16
some things remain obscure to exercise their diligence, yet the fundamental
doctrines of faith and precepts of life, are all Pro. 8.9.
plain and perspicuous.


Q. What need is there then of an interpreter?

A. 1 To Acts 8.31
unfold obscure places. 2 To 2 Pet. 1.12 1. Cor. 14.3.
inculcate and apply plain texts.


Q. How are the Scriptures to be interpreted?

A. By the Nehem. 8.8
Scriptures themselves, according to the Analogy of faith, and the scope and
circumstances of the present place.

Q. What is the use of Scripture?

A. It serves, and is 2. Tim. 3.16
profitable To teach truth, To convince error, For correction of vice, For
direction to good life, For Romans 15.4.
comfort in affliction, etc.


SECT. II. Of the Doctrine of the Scriptures, touching God himself.
Q. HOw do the Scriptures guide us to the saving knowledge of God?

A. By revealing unto us all necessary truths, concerning 1 God himself. 2
His works.


Q. What do the Scriptures teach us concerning God himself?

A. Four things; and first that Heb. 11.6.
there is a God.

Q. What proofs are there of this truth, besides the testimony of Scriptures?

A. Diverse, taken from 1 Gods works of Zech. 12.1.
creation, especially the soul of man. 2 His works of providence, chiefly his
Psalm. 9.16. and 58.10, 11.
apparent judgments on the wicked. 3 The common consent of all Nations, who
rather worship any god, or gods, then none at all. 4 The Esa. 31.14.
terrors of conscience, which make the most ungodly miscreants, will they, nill
they, to acknowledge, and Psalm. 53 5. and 14.5.
tremble at him, etc.


Q. What is the second thing that the Scripture teaches concerning God?

A. What God is, viz. Joh. 4.24.
a Spirit.

1 Most 1. Joh. 1.5.
simple, without mixture, or composition. 2 1. Tim 1.^ 17.
Eternal, without beginning, or end. 3 1 Kings 8 2^
Infinite, without comprehension of place, or thought. 4 Iam. 1.17.
Constant, without shadow of change. 5 Gen 17 1.
Absolute, in power, holiness, and glory.
Q. How then can he be known of us, being incomprehensible?

A. We only see his Exodus 33.23. and 34.5
back parts, not his face, and conceive of him by his names, expressing what
an one he is to us; not in his Iud. 13.18.
glorious nature, only known unto himself.

Q. What is the third thing which is taught us concerning God?

A. That there is only Deuteronomy. 6.4. Esa. 46.9.
one God and no more; as also both nature teaches, guiding all things to one
principle; and reason acknowledges, admitting but one that is infinite, and
independent.

Q. How is it then that many in Scripture are called Gods?

A. The name Elohim, or God, is sometimes improperly given to other things,
either as they Psalm. 82.6. Exodus 7.1.
participate of God his communicable attributes, or as they are 1. Cor. 8.5.
Phil. 3.19.
abusiuely set up by man in the place of God; but 1. Cor. 8.6.
unto us there is but one God and Lord, unto whom therefore the name Jehovah is
in scripture incommunicably appropriated.

Q. What is the fourth thing that we are taught concerning God?

A. That in this one simple and indiuided Godhead, we must acknowledge and
adore, Mat. 3.16, 17. and 28.19. 1. Ioh. 5.7.
three distinct persons, coessentiall, and coequall, to wit, the Father, the
Son, and the holy Ghost.

Q. What is the Father?

A. The first person in the Trinity, Ioh. 5.26.
having foundation of personal subsistence from none other.

Q. What is the Son?

A. The second person, Ioh. 5.26.
having foundation of personal subsistence from the Father, Psalm. 2.7. Pro.
8.22. etc
of whom he is eternally begotten.

Q. What is the holy Ghost?

A The third person, having foundation of personal subsistence from the Father
and the Son, Ioh. 14.26. and 15.26.
from both whom he eternally proceeds.

Q How may the distinction of these persons he conceived?

A. 1 In relation and order of subsistence betwixt themselves, as has been
showed. 2 In order and manner of working in the creatures, wherein 1 The Ioh.
5.17, 19
original of the action is ascribed to the Father. 2 The Ioh. 1.3. Heb. 1.2.
wisdom, and manner of working to the Son. 3 The Genesis 1.2. 1. Cor. 12.11.
efficacy of operation to the holy Ghost.



In a word, God the Father, in the Son, by the holy Ghost, works all things.

SECT. III. Of the doctrine of the Scriptures, touching the works of God: and
first touching his eternal decree.
Q. What are we taught in Scripture concerning the works of God?

A. That God, Psalm 135.6. Ephesians. 1.11.
as from eternity he decreed, so in time, and everlastingly he accomplisheth,
all things, unto the full execution of that his decree.

Q. How may we take a view of the works of God?

A. 1 Generally, in all his creatures: 2 Specially, in the chief of his
creatures, Viz. Angels, and Men.



Q. What is the decree of God concerning all creatures?

A. It is his eternal and unchangeable counsel and purpose, Prou 6.4 Romans
11.36
fore-ordaining all things unto his own glory.

Q. What is the decree of God touching Angels and men?

A. It is his free appointment, 1. These. 5.9
foreordaining them to a certain, and everlasting estate, for his own glory.

Q. What is that everlasting estate?

A. It is two fold, according to the Ibid.
parts of this his decree, which are 1. Election, that is, 1. Tim. 5.21
appointment of some Angels, and men, unto Romans 9.23.
everlasting glory and blessedness, for the Ephesians. 1.6.
praise of his goodness. 2 Reprobation, that is, Mat. 25.41 Rom 9.21. 2. Tim.
2.20
appointment of some Angels, and men, unto everlasting dishonor, for the
glory of his justice.


SECT. IIII. Of the execution of Gods decree: and first of Creation.
Q. HOw does God execute this his decree?

A. By 2. actions, viz. Creation, and Providence.


Q. What is Creation?

A. The Genesis 1. Heb. 11.3.
making of all things of nothing, very good, in the first six days of the
world.

Q. How did God create Angels?

A. He made them all at the first Col. 1.16
very good, and glorious spirits; yet Job 4.18.
mutable.

Q. When did God create man?

A. In the Genesis 1.25
sixth and last day of creation.

Q. How, and whereof did God make man?

A. 1 He formed his Genesis 2.7.
body of the dust of the earth: 2 He Ibid.
breathed in his face the breath of life; so making him a living soul.


Q. How many of mankind did God create at the first?

A. 1 Only Gen ^.7.
one man Adam: 2 Out of him, and for him, Oc. 2.5, ^^ Mal. 2.15
one woman Eve; so made he them Male, and Female.


SECT. V. Of Providence, sustaining, disposing and employing all creatures,
especially Angels.
Q. THus far of Creation, what is Providence?

A. The continual care, which God exercises upon his creatures, once made,
Psalm. 119.91
for the sustaining, and disposing of them.

Q. How does God sustain all creatures?

A. He vpholdeth them all in their being Heb. 1.3
by his mighty word: and that Partly by the continuation of particulars, either
for the whole time of this world, as 2. Pet. 3.4
heaven, and heavenly bodies, earth and other elements, etc. or for the time of
life allotted, as all Psalm. 36.6 and 104.27. etc
living creatures. Partly, by propagation of kind, whereby Genesis 7.3. and 8.21,
22
creatures, even of shortest continuance, do successively abide unto the end
of the world.


Q. How are Angels vpheld in their being?

A. They are all sustained by the power of God, so that they shall Luke 20.36
never dye, or return to nothing.

Q. How are men vpheld?

A. Two ways: and first, as all other bodily creatures, partly by maintenance
of Act 17.28 Psalm. 36.6 1 Timothy 4 10
every man's life here on earth, for the time allotted by God himself: partly
by Genesis 1.28 Eccl. 1.4.
propagation of kind, unto the end of the world, through the blessing of
procreation.

Q. How secondly?

A. As Angels, after a sort: God so providing, that when the Eccl. 12.7.
body of man returns to the earth, from whence it was taken, yet the soul
perishes not, but returns to God that gave it: yea that the Job. 19 26, 27.
same body also, and every part thereof, is preserved in the grave, and shall
be joined entire to the soul at the last day, so to continue for ever; as
shall be showed.

Q. How does God dispose of his creatures?

A. He guides, and employeth them, to those several ends, and uses, whereby
they may best Psalm. 119 91
serve unto his glory, and the good of themselves, and of their follow
creatures; Psalm. 8.
especially of man.

Q. How does God dispose of Angels?

A. Two ways: the first respecting their everlasting condition: the second
their emploiment.

Q. How did God dispose of Angels, in regard of their everlasting condition?

A. Diversely; according to the parts of his forementioned decree: for first,
he suffered the Reprobate Angels 2. Pet. 2 4
voluntarily and maliciously, without any temptation, to fall into that
impardonable sin of Jude 6.
Apostasio, and so into damnation irrecouerably; who are called Devils,
reserved in everlasting chains under darkness, unto the Judgment of the
great day.

Q. How did God dispose of elect Angels?

A. He confirmed them in their well-being, that they might Mat. 18.10
never fall by sin from their first blessed estate; which are called 2. Cor.
11.19
Angels of light, Job 1.6.
sons of God, Luke 2.13
heavenly soldiers, etc.

Q. How does God employ Angels?

A. He uses them all, Job. 1.6.
both good, and evil Angels, as his servants, and ministers, for the
accomplishment of his will and work.

Q. How are good Angels employed?

A. 1. To be as a Heb. 1.14 Psalm. 34.7. and ^1.11.
guard and garrison unto the Elect of mankind, for their comfort and
protection. 2. To 2. Kin. 19.35.
resist and punish the wicked.


Q. How are evil Angels employed?

A 1. In 2. Sam. 24.1 with 1. Chro. 21.1. Ephesians 6.12
trying and exercising the godly. 2. In 1. Kin. 22.21.22, 2. Cor. 4.4.
seducing and Luke 12.20.
tormenting the wicked.


SECT. VI. Of the Providence of God, disposing of man in this world, and of the
state of Innocence.
Q. HOw does God dispose of man?

A. As of that creature, Pro. 8.31.
in whom, Psalm. 8.3. etc. ^. Cor. 9.9 10
above all other he intends to let forth the glory of his wisdom, power,
and goodness: and therefore the Scriptures do most plentifully declare the
dealing of God with man, both in the time of this world, and for ever hereafter.

Q. How do the Scriptures set forth the dealing of God with man, in the time
of this world?

A. In a threefold estate, (viz.) 1. The state of Innocence. 2. The state of
corruption and misery, and 3. The state of Redemption.


The Eccl. 7.31
first commonly had and lost of all mankind, both Elect and reprobate, without
difference: Rom 3.13
the second seizing on all men naturally, but abiding without recovery only
on the reprobate: the third 1. Pet. 3.9. Psalm. 130.8.
proper to the Elect. All which do make way unto that final and everlasting
estate of honor, or dishonor, fore-appointed unto all men; beginning at the
end of this life, perfected at the day of Judgment, and continuing for ever
in the world to come.

Q. What is the state of Innocence?

A. The holy and happy condition of mankind, Genesis ^.27.
created by God after his own image, and and 2.8.
placed by him in Paradise.

Q. Wherein did that Image of God chiefly consist?

A. In four singular excellencies: viz.

1 A Job 10.12
reasonable and immortal soul. 2 True wisdom and holiness, adorning the
soul, Psalm. 51 6 Ephesians 4.24.
wherein especially he resembled his maker. 3. A 1. Cor. 11.7
body endued with beauty, strength, and immortality, answerable to the soul.
4 Genesis 1.28
Dominion over the creatures.
Q. What happiness had man, thus created and placed?

A. The image of God, in wisdom, and true holiness, shining in him Mat. 5.8.
without teinture or blemish, he enjoyed full fruition and assurance of the
Psalm. 17.15
favorable and blissful presence of this Creator, together with absolute
Genesis 2.25
contentment in himself, and service from all the creatures Ge. 2.10.20
to whom as their Lord, he gave their original names.

Q. What emploiment had man in this state?

A. A twofold emploiment, viz.

1 Outward, Genesis 2.15.
to till and dress the Garden: 2 Spiritual, to Ibid. v. 16. 17
worship and serve God his Creator, and procure his own everlasting
blessedness, whereto he was fitted with freedom of will, and ability for
perfect obedience unto God, according to the tenor of the covenant of works.
Q. What was the tenor of the covenant of works?

A. The substance of the Moral law, written in the hearts of our first
parents, with the promises of blessedness to them, if they should continue in
obedience, and threatenings of death and damnation, if they should transgress.

Q. How does it appear that the law was written in their hearts?

A 1 By the effect of it in them both, who immediately after their fall, were
forced by the only Genesis 3.8.
guilt of conscience, (not yet otherwise charged) to hide themselves from Gods
presence. 2 By the Genesis 4.6 To. 2.14.15
remainders thereof in all mankind, who even without the law, are by light of
nature a law unto themselves.


Q. How was the Covenant of works sealed?

A. By the two sacramental trees, planted for that purpose in the midst of
the garden. Viz.

The one, Genesis 2.9.
the tree of life, assuring life and glory, upon condition of obedience. The
other, the and ver. 17.
tree of knowledge of good and evil, sealing death and damnation in case of
disobedience.
SECT. VII. Of the state of Corruption and misery: and first of the Fall of
man.
Q. THus far of the state of Innocence: what is the state of Corruption and
misery?

A. The fearful condition whereinto in Adam Eccl. 7.31.
all mankind fell, by transgressing and violating the covenant of works.

Q. What are we to consider h^rein?

A. Two things, to wit, 1 The causes, 2 The effect, of the fall of man.


Q. To whom does the consideration of the causes direct us?

A. To three parties, differently concurring to the fall of man, viz. 1. God
permitting. 2 Satan tempting. 3 Man yielding, and falling.


Q. How did God permit the fall of man?

A. Not by Iam. 1.13. 1. Ioh. 2.26.
instilling into him any evil, or taking from him any ability unto good; but
1 2. Sa. 24.1. with 1. Chro. 21.1.
Suffering Satan to tempt him: 2 2. Chron. 32, 31.
Leaving man to the liberty, and mutabilitie of his own will, not hindering
his fall by supply of grace.


Q. Why did God permit man's fall?

A. He did it in great wisdom, to Romans 11.32
make way for the glory both of his mercy in those that shall be saved by
Christ, and of his justice in those that shall perish for their sins; yet
without wrong to any, To. 11.35.
being not bound to his creature to uphold him from falling by his grace.

Q. How did Satan tempt man?

A. Being himself fallen, in envy of Gods glory, and man's happiness, he Ge.
3.1. etc
subtly addressed himself, in the serpent, 2 Cor. 11.3. 1. Tim. 2.14
first to the woman, the weaker sex, and after by her unto the man, Genesis 3.5.
pretending greater love, and care of their well-doing, then was in God.

Q. Whereto did he tempt them?

A. To infidelity, unthankfulness, ambition, and so to slat disobedience, in
eating the forbidden fruit, as the means to attain to an higher degree of
blessedness.

Q. How did they yield to the temptation, being created good?

A. Being left by God to the Genesis 3.6.
mutabilitie of their own will, they Eccl. 7.31
voluntarily inclined unto that evil, whereunto they were tempted; thereby not
only Genesis 4.7.
loosing for themselves the image and favor of God, but withal Romans 3.23.
depriving their posterity of that blessed estate, and Romans 5, 12.
plunging them into the contrary.

Q. How could all their posterity fall with them?

A. Being in their loins, who were by Gods appointment to stand or fall in
that trial, not as singular persons only, but also as heads of mankind, Romans
5.19 ^. Cor. 15.22.
we all took part with them, both in this fall, and in the woeful effect
thereof.

SECT. VIII. Of the Consequents of the Fall: and first of Sin.
Q. WHat is the effect of this fall?

A. That which in Scripture is called the Genesis 5.3. and 6.3
image of Adam, the Ephesians 4.22
old man, the Joh. 3.6
flesh. etc.

Viz. the Romans 5.12.
state 1. Of sin: 2 By, and for sin of death.


Q. What is Sin?

A. A 1. Ioh. 3.4
sweruing from the law of God, making the sinner Genesis 4.7
guilty before God, and liable to the curse of the law.

Q. How is mankind in the state of sin, since the fall?

A. Every one, naturally descending from Adam, besides the guilt of that first
sin committed in Paradise, 1. Is Psalm. 51.5
conceived and borne in original corruption: 2. Living in this world, sins
also Genesis 6.5 Esa. 48.8.
actually; yea of himself Jer 13.23 Mat. 7.18.
can do nothing but sin; Tit. 1.15
neither is any thing pure unto him.


Q. What is original corruption?

A. It is the defacing of Gods image, consisting chiefly in wisdom and
holiness, and the impression of the contrary Ioh. 8.41. etc.
image of Satan, called Romans 7.7 Jam. 1.14
Concupiscence, consisting 1. In an utter Romans 7.18
disabilitie, and and 8.7.
enmity unto that which is good: 2. In Romans 7.14
pronenesse unto all manner evil.


Q. In what part of our nature does it abide?

A. In the whole man and every part.

1. Ephesians. 4.17 18, 19.
Darkening or Esaias 44.20
misleading the understanding: 2 Tit 1 15 Ephesians. 4.19
Benumming or Mar. 10.20 1. Cor. 8.7
abusing the conscience: 3 Romans 7.23 Rom 6.10
Enthralling and Ephesians 4.18
hardening the will: 4. Iam. 4.1 Gal. 5.17 Job 15.16.
Disturbing and disordering the affections: 5. Finally making the bodily senses
and members, Either 1. As Mat 5.29, 30
Porters to let in sin, or 2. As To. 6.12, 13 and 3.13. etc.
Instruments to execute it.

Q. Is the image of God then wholly defaced in man?

A. No. For he Iam. 3.9
remains still a creature reasonable and capable of grace, having the same
parts, and faculties he had before, and in them some relics of Gods image: as
in the understanding Joh. 1.9.
some light; in the conscience sometimes Rom 2.15.
right judgment; in the will, Romans 2.14
some liberty to good and evil, in natural and civil actions, and freedom
in all things from compulsion etc.

Q. What is actual sin?

A. It is sin committed Romans 5.14
after the manner of Adams transgression, to wit, a particular breach of Gods
law, leaving a Ier. 13.23
stain in the soul, which polluteth the sinner, and disposes him to further
evil.

Q. How is such sin committed?

A. Two ways, Viz. by 1. Omission of duty required: 2. Commission of evil
forbidden.
whether it be 1. Inwardly, in the Genesis 6.5. Mat. 15.19
understanding, will, or affections, or 2. Outwardly, in Esaias 3 8.
word or deed.


Q. By what degrees do men proceed in the committing of actual sin?

A. 2. Sam. 11.2
Temptation offered, Psalm. 7.14 Jam. 1.14.15
concupiscence taking liking conceiueth, whereupon ensues the committing, or
birth of sin: by custom and continuance wherein, the heart finally is Heb. 3
13
hardened.

Q. What are the different kinds of actual sin?

A. They are many, but we may reduce them to these five. Viz.

1. Esaias 6.5
Partaking with others sins: 2. Psalm 19.12
Sins of ignorance, or of an 1. Cor. 8.7
erring conscience. 3. Romans 7.19.
Sins of knowledge, through infirmity: 4. Psalm. 19.13 and 50.21. Eccle. 8.11.
Sins of Presumption and obstinacy: 5. Heb. 6.4.5, 6 and 10.29 Mar. 3.29, 30.
The impardonable sin against the holy Ghost.
Q. Do all natural men alike commit all these kinds of sin?

A. No; for though Romans 7.14.
all are alike disposed unto all manner evil, having in their corrupt nature
the seeds of every sin, yet does God, for the good of humane society,
restrain many from notorious crimes, by To. 13.3.4.5
fear of shame and punishment, desire of honor and reward. etc.

Q. How does God employ men in this state of sin?

A. 1. He guides them, partly by the To 2.14.13 Joh. 1.9.
light of nature, and partly, by Esaias. 44.28.
common graces of the Spirit, unto many actions, profitable for humane
society, and for the outward service of God. 2. He Act. 3.18 and 4 27.28
ouer-ruleth their evil and sinful actions, so that thereby they bring to
pass nothing, but what his hand and counsel had before determined for his
own glory.


SECT. IX. Of the second Consequent of the Fall, viz. Death: and of the Leaving
of Reprobates in this fearful state.
Q. HOw is man by sin in the state of death?

A. By the just sentence of God, delivering him Romans 5.12
for sin, into the power both of corporal and eternal death; signified by
Ge. 3.22. etc
expelling our parents out of Paradise, and debarring them of the Sacramental
tree of Life.

Q. What are we to understand by corporal death?

A. The Genesis 3.19 Eccl. 12.7
separation of the soul, and body, with all evils that attend thereon, or
make way thereto, as Deuteronomy. 28.15. etc.
sorrow sickness, shame, servitude, penury, etc. yea even Mal. 3.2 Psalm. 69.22
blessings are cursed, and Psalm. 69.22
prosperity causes ruin.

Q. What is eternal death?

A. It is the final 2. These 1.9.
separation of the whole man in hell for ever, from Gods favorable presence
and fellowship; together with present 2. Tim. 2.26 Ephesians. 2.2.
bondage under Satan, Heb. 10 27 Esaias 33.14
hellish horrors, and such like forerunners of damnation.

Q. By what law does God proceed in this punishment?

A. By the law of works, first written in the heart of Adam, and uttered to
his ear, in Paradise, and since more solemnly published, and fully expressed
by Moses and the Prophets, Deu. 29.^6 Romans 1.31. and 3 20.
for the discovery of sin, and the punishment due thereto.

Q. How comes it to pass, that the reprobate abide; without recovery in
this state of sin and death?

A. Because Act. 17.30 and 14.16.
the Lord does not grant unto them the benefit of Redemption, and grace of
faith and repentance unto life, but suffers them to run on in sin
deservedly unto condemnation.

Q. How does God suffer them so to run into condemnation?

A. In a diverse manner: Some reprobates dying infants; Others of riper years:
of which later sort, 1. Some are not called, 2. Others called.



Q. How does God deal with reprobates dying infants?

A. Being once conceived, they are in the Romans 5.14
state of death, by reason of the sin of Adam imputed, and of original
corruption cleaving to their nature, wherein also dying, they perish; as (for
instance) the children of Heathen parents; for touching the 2. Cor. 7.14
children of Christians, we are taught to account them holy.

Q. How does God deal with those of riper years uncalled?

A. Being naturally possessed Ephesians. 4.18.19.
with ignorance and vanity, he To. 1.26.28
gives them up to their own lusts, to commit sin without remorse, with
greediness, in a reprobate mind, until the Genesis 15.16. Psalm. 69.27.
measure of sin being fulfilled, they are cut off.

Q. How does God deal with such reprobates as are called?

A. He vouchsafes them the outward Heb. 4.1, 2 2. Cor. 10.1, 2, etc.
means of salvation, giving farther to some of them Yomo Heb. 6.4, 5.
illumination, a Act. 8.13.
temporary faith, some outward holiness, and taste of heaven; whom yet he
suffers to fall away, and the means of grace to become a 2. Cor. 2.16
savor of death unto them; yea some of those do Heb. 6.6.
fall, even to the sin unpardonable.

SECT. X. Of the state of Redemption by the Covenant of Grace: and of the
foundation thereof, viz. the Mediator.
Q. TO come to the state of Redemption, how does God recover his Elect out of
the state of sin and death?

A. By Romans 3.23, 24.
the new Covenant of Grace.

Q. What is the Covenant of Grace?

A. Gods Gal. 3.21, 22.
second contract with mankind, after the fall, for the restoring of him into
his favor, and to the state of happiness, by the means of a Mediator.

Q. How does this covenant differ from that of works?

A. In this chiefly, that the Covenant of works requires of every man, in his
own person, Deuteronomy. 27.26
perfect obedience, and in default, for Ezekiel. 18, 14 Gal, 3.10.11.
satisfaction, everlasting punishment: but the Covenant of grace Ibid. ver. 13,
14.
admits payment, and performance, by another, in behalf of so many as
receive it. Thus this Covenant Romans 3.31 and 10.4
abolisheth not, but is the accomplishment, and establishment of the former.

Q. When was this Covenant of grace first plighted between God and man?

A. Immediately after the fall, in Paradise, in that Genesis 3.15
promise given concerning the woman's seed; God in unspeakable mercy
propounding the remedy, before he pronounced sentence of judgment.

Q. What are we to consider in this covenant of grace?

A. Two things, to wit, 1. The foundation, which is the Mediator: 2. The
application thereof, for salvation, unto the Elect.


Q. What need was there of a Mediator?

A. Between parties so disagreeing, the one of finite nature offending, the
other of infinite nature offended, the one utterly disabled to 2. Cor. 3.5
do any the least good, or Job 9.3
satisfy for the least sin, the other requiring perfect Deuteronomy. 27.26
obedience and Mat. 18.34.
satisfaction, 1. Sam. 2.25
what agreement could there be without a Mediator?

Q. In this case, what was the Mediator then to do?

A 1. To Esaias 53.5.6 Job 33.24
pay all our debt, and satisfy Gods justice, by a 1. Tim. 2.6
price of infinite value: 2. To purchase, and merit for us Gods Ephesians. 1.6.
favor, and kingdom, by a most Romans 5.19
absolute and perfect obedience.


Q. What an one must he be, that should undertake this mediation?

A. He must be 1. Man, of kin to our nature offending, that Romans 8.3. 1. Cor.
15.21 Heb. 2.14, 15, 16.
in the same, he might satisfy; and withal, 1. Joh. 3.5.
perfectly just without exception. 2. Act. 20.28
God, that he might give worth and efficacy to his satisfaction and
obedience; and withal Heb. 2.10
the Son to make us children unto his heavenly Father.


Q. How many Mediators are there?

A. Only 1. Tim. 2.5
one: for though Deuteronomy. 5.31 Gal. 4 19
other are so called, yet are they only 2. Cor. 5.19 Job 33.23.
Ministers of the word, not Authors of the work of reconciliation.

Q. When was the Mediator given?

A. 1. If we regard Gods decree, Ephesians. 1.4.
from all eternity: 2. If the virtue and efficacy of his mediation, as soon
as need was even Reu. 13.8
from the beginning of the world. 3. If his manifestation in the flesh, in the
Gal. 4.4. 1. Tim. 2.6
fullness of time; from whence we now reckon more then 1600. yeeares.


Q. Who is this Mediator between God and man?

A. Luke 2.11 1. Tim. 2.5
Jesus, the son of the Virgin Mary, the promised Messiah or Christ, whom the
Ioh. 1.45 and 8.56.
Fathers expected, the Prophets foretold, whose 1. Joh. 1.1 Act. 1.1
life, death, resurrection and ascension, the Evangelists describe, whose 1.
Tim. 3.16 2. Cor. 10.4.5
word preached, unto this day, subdueth the world; finally whom we Act. 10.45
look for from heaven to be the Judge of quick and dead.

Q. Is there no need of any other Mediator for us unto Christ?

A. No. For he is Job 19.25
next of kin, most Heb. 2.17.
merciful, most faithful, and and 7.25
able perfectly to save all those that come to God through him.

SECT. XI. Of Jesus Christ, his Person, Offices, and twofold estate, of
Humiliation, and Exaltation.
Q. What do the Scriptures teach us touching Christ?

A. Two things 1. His person; 2. His office.


Q. What are we taught touching the person of Christ?

A. 1. His two natures Viz The Godhead, And manhood:
2. The hypostaticall, or persosonall union of both, into one Immanuel.


Q. How How is the Godhead of Christ proved?

A. Not only by abundant Esaias 7.14 and 9.6. etc.
testimonies of scripture, but also by his miracles, especially the Romans 1.4
raising of himself from death, together with the Act 5.39
continuance and conquest of the Gospel, and that Zech. 4^^
not by carnal power or policy, but only by the power of his spirit, and
Reu. 12.11
patient suffering of his Saints.

Q. How does it appear that Christ was man?

A. Besides manifold Genesis 3 15 1. Tim. 2.5. etc.
predictions, and clear testimonies, it is abundantly proved by plentiful
experiments, especially by his 1. Pet. 3.18 Heb. 2.14
partaking of humane infirmities, and suffering of death.

Q. Being very man, how could he be without sin?

A. Because he was not begotten, after the ordinary course, by man, but Lu.
1.34.35
formed of the only substance of the Virgin, and that substance, in the
conception, sanctified by the holy Ghost.

Q. What is the personal union of these two natures?

A. The Ioh. 1.14 Heb. 2.16
assuming of the humane nature (having no subsistence in it self) into the
person of the Son of God, and in that person uniting it to the Godhead; so
making one Christ, Mat. 1.2 3
God and man.

Q. What is the office of Christ?

A. The 1. Tim. 2.5
Mediator-ship, which being one, has yet three denominations from three
several functions: Viz. Prophetical Priestly Kingly.


Q. What is his Prophetical Office?

A. The office of Esaias 61.1 Mat. 23.8.10.
instructing his Church: which he did and does perform two ways viz.

1. Outwardly, as Math. 23.37 1. Pet. 3.19.
before his incarnation by the Prophets, Priests, and Scribes of the Old
Testament, and in the days of his flesh in his Heb. 2.3
own person, as a Romans 15.8
Minister of the Circumcision, (but with the Mat 7.29
authority of the Lawgiver) so since unto the worlds end 2. Cor. 4.6 and
5.19, 20
by his Apostles, and Ministers, Ephesians. 4.11
called and fitted by him for that purpose: 2. Inwardly by the Luke 24.49. Act.
16 14
joint operation of his holy spirit.
Q. What is the Priestly function of Christ?

A. It is that whereby he Heb. 5.1, 5. etc.
appeaseth and reconcileth God to his Elect.

1. Performing for them absolute Romans 5.19
obedience to the whole law of God. 2. Offering himself unto his Father, 2.
Cor. 5.21
a sacrifice propitiatory for all their sins. 3. Heb 9.24 1. Ioh. 2.1, 2
Romans 8.34 Heb. 12.24
Appearing ever at the right hand of God to make intercession for them.
Q. What is the kingly office of Christ?

A. It is the exercise of that Psalm. 110.1
power given him by God over all, and Mat. 28.^8 Psalm. 2.8. etc.
possession of all, for the Esaias 9 7.
spiritual government, and salvation of his Elect, and for the Esaias 9.7.
destruction of his and their enemies.

Q. In what state did Christ God and man perform this threefold office?

A. In a twofold estate. Viz. of 1. Humiliation and 2. Exaltation.


Q. What was his state of humiliation?

A. It was the Psalm. 45.5
base condition of a servant whereto he humbled himself from his conception
to his cross, and so until the time of his resurrection.

Q. What is his estate of Exaltation?

A. His Phil. 2.7.8
glorious condition, beginning at the instant of his Phil 2.9 Heb. 2.9
resurrection, and comprehending his Act. 2.24
Ascension, Ephesians. 4.8
sitting at the right hand of God, and 1. Pet. 3.22
second coming in glory to judge the world. Ma. 15.31


SECT. XII. Of the Application of the Covenant of Grace, and first of our union
with the person of Christ.
Q. HItherto of the Foundation of the Covenant of Grace, viz. the Mediator:
what is the Application of it?

A. The communicating thereof for salvation to every one of Gods Elect, giving
him Heb 3.14
part in Christ the Mediator, and all his benefits.

Q. What part has every Elect in Christ hereby?

A. 1. Vnio^ with Christ's person. 2. Communion.


Q. How are the Elect united to Christ his person?

A. They are incorporated, and made Ephesians. 5.30
members of the mystical body whereof Christ is head; which the Scripture
figureth, as by other resemblances, so especially under the Ephesians. 5.2. Item
Cautic. the whole ho^ke.
similitude of marriage.

Q. How may we conceive of this our marriage with Christ?

A. We are to conceive therein as in outward marriage, 1. The consent of parents
and parties. 2. The manner of conjunction.


Q. What consent of parents is there in this marriage?

A. Only Gods donation, who being the alone parent of both parties (as in the
Genesis 2.22.
marriage of the first Adam) gives, 1. John 3 16. John 17.6.
Christ to us, as a Savior. 2. Heb. 2.13.
Us to Christ, as a people to be saved.


Q. What consent of parties is there?

A. 1. Christ consents to take us as his own spouse, which he witnessed
especially by taking Heb. 2.14.
our flesh upon him, that he might be our Matt. 1.23.
Immanuel, or God with us. 2. We being John 6.44.
drawn of God, and 2. Cor. 11.2
prepared by the friends of the Bridegroom, do Cant. 7.10.
consent to take Christ as our Lord and Husband, as we profess by taking his
Esaias 44.5.
name and Mat. 11.29.
yoke upon us.


Q. What is the manner of this our conjunction?

A. Mystical, that is to say: Real, in respect of the things conioined, our
very nature, body and soul, being coupled to the body and soul of Christ, (so
that we are Ephe. 5.30
members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones) and thereby also to the 1.
Cor. 1.30
divine nature: yet not corporal, but Spiritual, in regard of the means,
whereby this conjunction is wrought.


Q. What are the means of this spiritual conjunction?

A. On Christ's part, his holy 1. Ioh. 4.15. Romans 8.9.
Spirit, Gal. 4.6. 1. John 3.24. and 4.13.
given by him unto every member of his body, in the very moment of
regeneration, as the Gal 5.25. 1. Cor. 15 45.
soul of spiritual life, and fountain of supernatural grace; in which
respect, 1. Cor. 6.17
he that is joined to the Lord, is said to be one spirit.

Q. What is the spirit of Christ?

A. The holy 1 Cor. 3.16
Ghost, truly residing, and powerfully Romans 5.5.
working in all those that are Christ's, Romans 8.2.
derived unto them from him, and 1. Cor. 12.13 Ephesians 2.18. and 4.4.
knitting them inseparably unto him.

Q. Is the Holy Ghost given to none, but such as are thus joined unto Christ?

A. The Holy Ghost is considered three ways; 1. As the Author of all
excellency, even in common gifts of nature and reason, as Jud. 14.6.
strength and courage, Exodus 31.3
Arts and Sciences, 1. Sam. 11.6
Policy and Government, etc. In which sense he is given to many that never
heard of Christ. 2. As the Author of 1. Cor. 12.1.4.
spiritual gifts, so called, because being sanctified, they are means of
edification, as the power of working miracles, healing, languages, etc. yea a
Heb. 6.4 5.
taste of the heavenly gift, and of the good word of God, and of the powers of
the world to come. In which sense, he is given to sundry reprobates, that are
called, as has been showed. 3. As the Author of the perpetual, effectual,
and Ioh. 6.63.
vital influence of saving grace from Christ the head, to every true member of
his body. In which sense, Ioh. 14.17
the world cannot receive or know him, but he is bestowed on the 1. Pet. 1.2.
Elect only, and those truly regenerated, and converted unto the Lord.


Q. But on our parts, what means is there of this conjunction?

A. Only faith; which yet is Ephesians. 2.8.
not of our selves, but the gift of God, and of all other the first, and most
general effect and instrument of the 2. Cor. 4.13. Gal. 5 5.
spirit of Christ, Ephesians. 3.16.17
disposing and inabling us, so to embrace and cleave unto him, as 1. To Romans
5.2.
receive from God by him, whatsoever benefits and graces. 2. To Col 2.7. Gal.
5.6
return to God in him, all holy and thankful obedience.


SECT. XIII. Of our Communion with Christ, in regard of his Prophetical
office, by the Revelation of the Covenant of Grace; and of the first outward
means of Revelation; viz. the Gospel preached.
Q. What is our communion with Christ?

A. It is our participation with him in the benefits, flowing from his several
offices. For being made one with him, we are thereby Reu. 2.28. Col. 2.10.
possessed of all things that are his, as the wife of the wealth of her
husband, the John 15.5.
branch of the sap of the root, and the Ephesians. 4.15, 16.
members of sense and motion from the head. In which regard the whole Church is
called also 1. Co. 12.12. Galat. 3.16.
Christ, and the several members Acts 11.26.
Christians.

Q. What are the benefits which we partake with Christ flowing from his
offices?

A. They are the fruits of his Prophetical, Priestly, and Kingly functions,
whereby, as he is 1. Cor. 1.30
made to us of God, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, so
we also by him after a sort, become Act. 2.17.18
Prophets, 1. Pet. 2.9. Revel. 5.10,
Priests and Kings.

Q. What fruit receive we by the Prophetical function of Christ, to make us
Prophets?

A. The Mat. 11.27. and 16.17. John 14.21. Psalm. 25 14.
Revelation of Gods covenant of grace, whereby Christ is made unto us of God,
wisdom, and we 2. Tim. 3.15 1. John 5.20
wise for our own and others salvation.

Q. Touching this revelation, what are we to consider?

A. Three things, viz. the Means whereby, it is imparted. Manner how, it is
imparted. Subjects to whom, it is imparted.


Q. What are the means whereby God reuealeth his covenant?

A. They are of two sorts: 1. outward, viz. 1. the Word, and 2. the Sacraments.
2. inward.


Q. What is here meant by the Word, the first outward means?

A. The Gospel preached, called the Romans 10.8.
word of faith, and of Act. 20.32
grace; containing ( Pro. 3.18
as a second tree of life) the promise of Ioh. 6.68. 2. Tim. 1.10.
life and salvation, by Christ the Mediator, which is the substance of the
Covenant of grace.

Q. In what part of the Scripture is the Gospel contained?

A. Heb. 13 8. Romans 10.6
Both in the old and the new Testament: in the former, more sparingly and
darkly, under Genesis 3.15. and 49 10
obscure promises and Heb. 10 1.
shadows of legal ceremonies, proper to the Jews; but in the latter, most
Romans 16.25 26
plainly and plentifully, in the clear declaration both of the truth and fruit
of Christ, already exhibited to all nations. In which regard especially, it is
termed a Heb. 9.15. and 8.8. etc.
new Covenant or Testament.

Q. To what part of Gods word is the Gospel opposed?

A. To the LaW, which containing the Gal. 3.10
tenor of the forementioned Covenant of works, is notwithstanding this latter
Covenant of grace, often urged in the Romans 1.18. Deuteronomy. 27.26. Ez. 18 4, 5. etc
Leuit. 18.5.
Scriptures, especially of the old Testament.

Q. What use is there of the Law, the Gospel being published?

A. Not as of a Gal. 1.12.
cause, properly working faith and grace, (for that belongs only to the Act.
20.24. Ephesians. 1.13.
Gospel) but yet as of a needful preparatiue thereunto, that being Romans 8.15.
humbled by the Law, seeing our selves not Gal. 3.11.
capable of salvation by the covenant of works, we may be forced to Matt. 11.28.
^lie to the remedy; offered unto us in the grace of the Gospel.

Q. What need is there of the preaching of the Gospel, seeing we may read it?

A. Because, though 1 Cor. 1.21
foolishness to the world, it is the Deu. 18.17, etc.
ordinance of God, and his Romans 1.16.
power to salvation: and we have need to have the word not only propounded in
gross, but also Romans 10.14 Gal. 3.2. Act. 8.30.31. 2 Timothy 2.15.
expounded, divided, and applied by the ministry, for that end by Christ
ordained.

SECT. XIIII. Of the second outward means, viz. the Sacraments.
Q. TO proceed to the other outward means: What are Sacraments?

A. Romans 4.11.
Seals annexed 1. Cor. 21.23
by God, to the word of the Covenant of Grace, to instruct, assure, and Gal.
3.27.
possess us of our part in Christ, and his benefits, and to bind us in all
thankful obedience unto God in him.

Q. How does God by the Sacraments assure us of his mercies in Christ?

A. By exhibiting to the worthy receiver, by such outward signs, whether
elements, or actions, as himself for relief of our weakness has prescribed,
whole 1. Cor. 10.4
Christ, God and man, with all his benefits; in 2. Cor. 1.20.
whom all the promises of God are, Yea and Amen.

Q. How do they bind us unto God?

A. We receiving them as pledges of his infinite love in Christ, do thereby
profess our selves Col. 2.6, 7.
bound to express our thankfulness, by all duties to his Majesty; and for his
sake Ephesians. 4.3, 4, 5
one to another.

Q. What Sacraments be there of the Covenant of Grace?

A. They be of two sorts: viz. 1. Some of the old Testament, before Christ's
coming. 2. Other of the new, under Christ.


Q. What Sacraments were there of the old Testament?

A. Besides diverse 1. Pet. 3.20, 21. 1. Cor. 10 1, 2, 3, 4.
extraordinarily given, and serving but for a season, there were two of
ordinary and perpetual use, from their institution until the coming of
Christ, (to which those other may be referred) viz.

1. Genesis 17.10, etc. Deuteronomy. 30.6.
Circumcision, for entrance into the Covenant. 2. Exodus 12.3, etc. 1. Cor. 5.7.
The Passover, for continuance and confirmation therein.
Q. What Sacraments be there of the new Testament?

A. Only two: to wit, 1. Baptism, succeeding in the place of Circumcision. 2.
The Supper of the Lord, answering to the Passover.


Q. How do these Sacraments of the new Testament differ from those of the old?

A. In respect, Romans 4.11. 1. Cor. 10.2.3, 4.
Not of the Author, God, the substance, Christ, or the receivers, the people of
God, which are in both the same: But of Mat. 28.19, 20.
continuance, 1. Cor. 11.26
evidence, easy performance, and efficacy: in all which, 2. Cor. 3.9.
these of the new Testament have great preeminence.


SECT. XV. Of Baptism.
Q. What is Baptism?

A. The former Sacrament of the new Testament, by the Ephesians 5.26
washing of water, representing the powerful 1 Cor 6.11. Heb. 10.22.
washing of the blood, and spirit of Christ; and so sealing our John 3.5. Tit.
3.5.
new birth, and entrance into the Covenant of grace.

Q. How was this Sacrament ordained and brought into the Church, in the place
of Circumcision?

A. At the John 1.33.
commandment of God, by the ministry first of Matthew. 3.1.
John, therefore called the Baptist: after, sanctified and confirmed by our
Savior Christ himself, being Matt. 3.13.
baptized by John, and giving Mat. 28.18.
commission to his Apostles and Ministers, to continue the same in his Church
unto the end.

Q. What are the necessary and essential parts of this Sacrament?

A. Two: viz.

1. The outward element of John 1.31.
water, together with the actio^ of Ephesians. 5.26. Act. 8.36, etc. and 2.41.
washing, that is, dipping or sprinkling the party baptized, Mat. 28.19.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost. 2. The spiritual
thing signified, viz. the Heb. ^.14.
blood and 1. Cor 6.11.
spirit of Christ, washing away both the Act. 2.38.
guilt and Eze. 36.25
filthiness of sin.
Q. Does this spiritual washing always accompany the outward action?

A. No: for howsoever God for his part, do ever Ezekiel. 24.13
offer it at the present unto all, yet do the 1. Pet. 1.2
Elect only effectually partake the spiritual benefit; and that Gal. 3.27.
then first, when by the spirit and faith they are united unto Christ: from
which time, baptism once received, remains a Zech. 13.1.
fountain always open for sin and for uncleanness.

Q. How far forth does Baptism cleanse the elect from sin?

A. From 1. Cor. 6.9.10, 11. 1. John 1.7. Psalm. 51 7.
all sins, as well actual as original, as well committed after Baptism, as
before: and that Esaias 1.18.
perfectly, in respect of the guilt, although Ioh. 13.10 Psalm. 51.2.
imperfectly, and by degrees, in respect of the pollution and power of sin.

Q. Who are to be admitted to this Sacrament?

A. Whosoever are outwardly comprehended in the Covenant: whether th y be, 1.
of riper years Acts 8.37.
converted to the profession of the faith: or, 2. 1 Cor. 7.14
children borne of Christian parents.


SECT. XVI. Of the Lords Supper.
Q. What is the Lords Supper?

A It is the other Sacrament of the new Testament, wherein God by the signs of
bread and wine, signifies, seals, and exhibiteth to every faithful
receiver, the body and blood of Christ for his spiritual nourishment and
growth in Christ, and so confirms him in the Covenant of Grace.

Q. How was this Sacrament instituted in stead of the Passover?

A. Our Lord Jesus Christ 1. Cor. 11.23
in the night that he was betrayed, Matthew. 26.26, etc.
immediately after he had eaten the Passover with his Disciples, did both
himself with them celebrate this holy Sacrament, and withal 1. Cor. 11.24,
25, 26.
give charge for continuance of the same in the Church until his second
coming: in which regard it is called the 1. Cor. 11.20.
Lords Supper.

Q. What are the essential parts of this Sacrament?

A. As of all other Sacraments, two: to wit, 1. The outward signs, viz. the
Mat. 26.26, 27.
elements of bread and wine, together with the actions of blessing and
distributing, taking and communicating, according to our Saviors first
institution. 2. The spiritual Ibid.
things signified, viz. the body and blood of Christ, sanctified and Ioh. 6.50,
51
given us by God, and by faith received of us, for the nourishing and
preserving of our souls and bodies unto eternal life.


Q. Is Christ's body and blood, together with the outward elements, received of
all Communicants?

A. No: for howsoever they be Mat. 26.26.
offered by God to all, yet are they received by such alone, as have the hand of
faith to lay hold on Christ. As for those that come without faith, they receive
1. Cor. 11.27.
only the outward elements, and that unto Verse. 29.
condemnation.

Q. Who are to be partakers of this Sacrament?

A. All baptized, who are of years and sound judgment to discern the Lords
body, ought to repair to this Sacrament: but those only come worthily, who
professing the true faith, have duly 1. Cor. 11.28
examined and prepared themselves.

Q. How ought every Christian coming to this Sacrament, to examine and prepare
himself that he may come worthily?

A. By due search and trial of himself, whether he have in him the conditions,
by God required in worthy Communicants, viz.

2. Cor. 13.5. 1. Tim. 1.15.
Faith, grounded upon knowledge both of Gods will in general, and this holy
Sacrament in particular. Heb. 10.22. James 48.
Repentance of sins past, atte^ded with true Zech. 12.10.
l^ue of God, and of his 1. Cor. 16.14.
brethren.
Q. How ought every Christian thus prepared, to demean himself in receiving,
and after?

A. 1. In the present actio^, with reverence, intention and thanksgiving, 1.
Cor. 11.26.
co^memorating the Lords death, for the comfort and refreshing of his soul, and
Romans 12.1.
ofring up himself soul and body as a sacrifice of thanks: in which regard it
is called the Eucharist. 2. Afterward, continually indeuoring to find an Col.
2.6, 7.
increase of his faith in Christ, love to God and all his saints, power to
subdue sin, and practice obedience, with all other 2. Pet. 3.18
saving and sanctifying graces.


SECT. XVII. Of the inward means of revealing the Covenant of Grace, viz. the
Spirit, and Faith.
Q. What are the inward means whereby God reuealeth his Covenant of Grace?

A. They are 2. Viz. 1. The Spirit. 2. Faith.


Q. What is here meant by the Spirit?

A. A special effect of the Spirit of Christ beforementioned, dwelling in our
hearts, testifying, on Gods part, his free love, and gracious purpose touching
our salvation in Psalm. 35.3
particular, bearing Romans 8.16
witness with our spirits that we are, in Christ, his Children, and he our
Father, and withal guiding us to the Psalm. 16.7 Ioh. 14.26
knowledge of the whole will of God, revealed in his word; called therefore the
Ephesians. 1.17
spirit of wisdom or Revelation.

Q. Does the Spirit always witness the love of God unto us?

A. The witness of the spirit is Romans 5.5. Ephesians. 2.13.14.
continual, yet it is Psalm. 51.10 and ver. 7.8
not always with like feeling and comfort apprehended, because neither are our
hearts always alike purged, humbled and enlarged to receive it, nor the sweet
promises of the Gospel ( Esaias 59.21.
whereon the spirit groundeth this testimony) with like care attended on, and
meditated.

Q. How may we discern between the persuasion of Gods Spirit, and the
presumption of our own hearts?

A. Among other, by these three differences. Viz. that 1. Presumption gives
Deu. 29.19
liberty to continue in sin, but Gods spirit Ioh. 16.8
rebukes us for every sin. 2. Presumption Jer 3.4, 5
relyeth on Gods love; not loving him, but Gods spirit makes us Cant. 8.6. 1.
Ioh. 4.19
love him because he has loved us first. 3. Prosumptio^ is joined with
self-loue, but Gods spirit, revealing his mercy to us, makes us Job 42.5, 6.
Ezekiel. 16.63. and 36.31
abhor our selves.


Q. What mean you here by Faith?

A. That special act of faith, whereby we 1. Ioh. 5.10.
give credit to the report of the word and spirit of Christ, touching our
salvation in particular, and so Ioh. 3.33
set to our seal that God is true.

Q. How are we brought to give credit to the word and spirit?

A. By the Romans 10.17.
ministry of the same word, with the Sacraments annexed, and the power of the
same spirit; by which only means God works, and sets on work, this
grace of faith, in the hearts of his Children, from the general promises of
the Gospel, 1. Tim. 1.15. Ioh. 20.28
particularly, and Job 19.25 1. Pet. 1.13.
undoubtedly to conclude their own salvation.

Q. Can all that have faith, particularly, and undoubtedly resolve of their
salvation?

A. 1. Many for a time rest secure in a flirting persuasion, which may appear
not to be true faith, in that it Act. 15.9
purges not the heart. 2. The Elect having true faith, Luke 22.32 Romans 11.29
never failing, and working in them sound assurance, must yet ordinarily Mar
9.24 Luc. 17.5
strive against doubting, and may Psalm. 51.12 and 31 22. and 42.5.
at times, (falling into sin, or some spiritual affliction) loose for a
season, the joy and feeling of this assurance.


SECT. XVIII. Of the manner of revealing the Covenant of Grace, viz. Vocation.
Q. THus much of the means: now what is the manner of revealing the Covenant
of Grace?

A. It is Romans 8.30 Heb. 3.1.
Vocation, or Calling; when God by the means aforesaid, acquainting men with
his gracious purpose of salvation by Christ, Hos. 2.14
inuiteth them to come unto him.

Q. Are there not different kinds of Calling?

A. Yes: there is two fold calling.

1. Effectual, peculiar to those few that are Elect, whereby God (become in
Christ their Father) does not only outwardly by his word inuit, but Genesis 9.27
Psalm. 65.4 and 25.14 Joel. 2.32 Acts 2.39
inwardly also and powerfully, by his spirit, allure and win their hearts to
cleave to him inseparably unto salvation. 2. Esaias 48.12
Outward only; and ineffectuall, whereby Mat. 22.14
many are called, who are not chosen; as has been showed.
Q. How does this latter differ from the former calling?

A. Howsoever we are to 1. Cor. 1.2
judge charitably of all outwardly called, because who among them are also
inwardly called is only 2. Tim. 2.19
known to God; yet does this outward calling differ from the former.

1. In that it is wrought only by Heb. 4.2.
outward means and common illumination without the Iud. v. 19.
spirit of regeneration, or any portion of Luke 8.13
saving faith. 2. In that they are admitted only to an outward and Act. 8.13
Romans 9.4.5
temporary league of formal profession, 1. Ioh. 2.19. 1. Cor. 1.8.9
not to that entire fellowship with Christ, required unto salvation.
SECT. XIX. Of the Subjects, to whom the Covenant of Grace is revealed, viz.
the Church.
Q. TO come to the third thing propounded touching this Revelation, to whom
does God reveal his Covenant of Grace?

A. Ioh 14.22 and 17.9 Mat. 11.25 1. Cor. 2 8 etc.
Not to the world, but to his Church called out of the world.

Q. What mean you by the Church?

A. The whole number of Gods Elect, effectually called into Ephe. 5.32
fellowship with Christ, by the means, and in the manner formerly mentioned;
which we profess to believe under the title of the holy Catholic Church.

Q. Where is this holy Catholic Church?

A. Part already in heaven Heb. 12.13. Reu. 7.14. etc.
triumphant in their Masters joy, Reu. 6.7.
waiting for the fulfilling of the number of their fellow members, and their
own consummation in perfect bliss: Part as yet Reu. 1.9. and 12.11.
militant on earth in the service and warrefare of their Lord, expecting in due
time to be also 2. Tim. 4.7, 8
crowned with victory, and triumph in glory.


Q. Who are true members of the Church militant on earth?

A. Those alone, who, as Ephe. 1.22, 23. Col. 1.18
living members of the mystical body, are, by the spirit and faith Col 3.3.
Psalm. 83.3.
sccretly, and inseparably conioined unto Christ their head; in which respect
the true militant Church is both invisible, and Mat. 16.18
invincible.

Q. But are none to be accounted members of this Church, but such as are so
inseparably united unto Christ?

A. Truly, and properly 1. Joh. 2 19
none other: howbeit, because God uses outward means, with the inward, for
the gathering of his Saints, and calls, them as well to Act. 2 42. Cant. 1.7
outward profession among themselves, as to inward fellowship with his Son,
whereby the Church becomes visible; hence it comes, that so many as Act.
8.13
partaking the outward means, do join with these in league of visible
profession, are therefore, in humane judgment, accounted members of the true
church, and 1. Cor. 1.2.
Saints by calling; until the Lord (who only knows who are his) do make
known the contrary. As we are taught in the Mat. 13, 24.47. etc.
parables of the tares, the drawnet, etc.

Q. Has Christ then his Church visible upon earth?

A. Yea, throughout the world, in the particular Romans 3.3
congregations of Christians, called to the profession of the true faith and
obedience of the Gospel. In which Romans 11.5
visible assemblies, and not elsewhere, the true members of the Church
invisible, on earth, are to be found; and unto which therefore all that seek
salvation must gladly Esaias 60.4.
join themselves.

Q. Are we to acknowledge one visible Church, or many?

A. Ephe. 4.4. etc. Cant. 6.8 Gal. 3.28.
One alone, as there is but one Lord, one Spirit, one Faith, and one Baptism:
notwithstanding the parts of this one Church may be distinguished in respect
1. Of time, as the Churches Heb. 13.8
before Christ, and since: Primitive and present reformed: etc. 2. Of place, as
the Churches of Judea, Asia, England, France, Germany, etc. which all, being
1. Tim. 3.15
one, yet (as the sea) receive several names from the countries where through
they pass, and are Reu. 1.11
accounted as so many several Churches.


Q. Must not then this one visible Church have one visible head here on earth?

A. No: For it is visible not in the whole, but in the parts, whereto the
circumstances of time, and place for opportunity of visible profession, do
agree: and therefore, as Catholic, or universal, the Church has no head, but
Ephesians. 1.22.23.
Christ alone, always Mat 28.20
present by his word and spirit, to give Gal. 2.20
life, sense, and motion to every member.

Q. Is the Church always visible in her parts?

A. Christ has, and Romans 11.1, 2, 3, 4.
ever had, from the beginning, his Church visible upon earth, that is, some
companies of believers making profession of the same common faith; howbeit many
times by persecution forced to Reu. 12.14.
hide themselves from the eye of the world, and happily by the rage of the
enemy, so scattered, that (as in the 1. Kin. 19, 10
days of Elias) they can hardly be known, or have intercourse between
themselves.

Q. What are the infallible notes, whereby to discern a true visible Church,
with which we may safely join?

A. The same, and no other, which are the only outward means, ordained by
God, for the calling and gathering of his Saints, and which give being to a
Church, proving it to be a 1. Tim. 3.15
pillar of truth, viz. the Mat. 28.19, 20.
word preached, and Sacraments administered, according to the commandment of
Christ our Savior; as for other notes, they are either 1. Accidental, and in
great part separable, or 2. Utterly impertinent, and forged, for the upholding
of the Romish synagogue.


Q. May not such a Church err, and be corrupted, or fall, and become no
Church?

A. 1. The Church considered in her true members, can Mat. 16.18. Phil. 1.6 1.
These. 5.24.
never utterly fall; howsoever Cant. 1.4
no congregation be so pure, that it may be said at any time to be free from
all corruption, or so constant, but that, at times, it may be shaken, in the
very foundation of truth: as may appear by the churches of 1. Cor. 15.12.33
Corinth, Gal. 3.1. etc
Galatia etc. 2. Being considered with respect to the place, God does not
always continue a succession of true believers within the same limits and
borders; and hence we say, that diverse Churches are fallen, as those of Asia,
etc. neither is any place so privileged, but that for sin the Reu. 2.5
Candlestick may in time be thence removed.


Q. How may we judge of a Church corrupt, or ceasing to be a Church?

A. 1. Where God, utterly Act. 13.46
taking away the means of his word and worship, has apparently given the Esaias
50.1.
bill of divorce, there are we not to acknowledge any Church at all: as at
this day in Jerusalem, once the holy City. 2. But where these means are yet
continued, we are to acknowledge a Reu. 2.1^, 13
Church of Christ, howsoever more or less corrupt, according to the greater,
or less abuse of Gods word and worship.


Q. Since Churches may be so diversely corrupted, from which, and how far are
we to separate?

A. From Churches mortally sick of Tit 3.10, 11
heresy, or Reu. 18.4
idolatry, as it were of a contagious plague or leprosy, we are to separate;
Howbeit, whiles there is yet any life, rather from the scab, or sore, then from
the body: that is, from the prevailing faction, maintaining fundamental
errors, and forcing to idolatrous worship. Such is our separation from the
present Church of Rome, not from such therein, who, either, meaning well in
general, are Reu. 2.24.
ignorant of the depth of Satan, or 1 ^^n. 19.18
secretly dissent from those damnable corruptions; with whom, as a body yet
retaining life, we desire to Phil. 1.18
join, so far, as we may with safety from the foresaid contagion.

Q. Are we to continue fellowship with all other Churches, not so deadly and
dangerously corrupt?

A. From Churches holding the foundation, in substance of faith and worship,
though otherwise not free from blemish, we are 1. K^n. 15.14 and 2^.43
not to separate, farther then in dislike and refusal of that wherein they do
apparently separate from Christ, in respect either of manners, doctrine, or
form of public worship.

Q. To conclude touching the Church, what distinction is there of the
particular members?

A. 1. Generally, they are all the Ephesians. 3 15
family of Christ, and Ioh. 10.2, 3, 4.
sheep of his flock, hearing his voice, and following him. 2. More specially
out of these Christ, the chief Prince and Shepherd, has instituted, as
guides unto rest, 1. 1. Cor. 12 28
Ministers, called Pastors, Joh. 21.15. 1. Pet. 5.2
to feed his flock, with the wholesome food of the word and Sacraments. 2.
Princes and Magistrates, to see to the ways of his household, that all, both 2.
Chro. 35.3. etc. and 34. ver. 32, 33
Ministers and people, do their office and duty, even in things concerning
God.



SECT. XX. Of our Communion with Christ in regard of his Priestly office, viz.
our Justification.
Q. THus much of the benefit, flowing unto us from the Prophetical Office of
Christ, what fruit have we of his Priestly function?

A. Our Romans 3.25 2. Cor. 5.19
Reconciliation with GOD, through him, made unto us of God 1. Cor. 1.30
righteousness, whereby alone we are perfectly To. 8.33, 34
justified (i.) acquitted and accounted just in the sight of God.

Q. How does Christ become righteousness unto us, for justification in the
sight of God?

A. Only by Gods free and gracious To. 5.18, 19
imputation of the righteousness of Christ unto us, Phil. 3.9
in which, as in the garment of our elder Brother, we are accepted, and
obtain the blessing from him, our heavenly Father.

Q. What righteousness of Christ is it, that God imputes to us?

A. Not the essential righteousness of his divine nature, but only that
perfect Heb. 7.26.
integrity of the humane nature, which in him was without all guile; and that
absolute obedience, whereby, in that nature of ours, he 1. Mat. 3.15
Fulfilled in act every branch of the law of God. 2. Esaias 53.5 1. Pet. 2.24. 1.
Joh. 2.2
Satisfied by his sufferings, for the sins of the whole world of his Elect.


Q. How can Christ's righteousness be accounted ours?

A. Because it is in CHRIST, not as in a person, severed from us, but as in the
head of our common nature, the second Adam; Romans 5.19.
from whom therefore it is communicated unto all, that, being united as
members unto him, do lay Romans 10.4
claim thereto, and apply it unto themselves,

Q. How is this claim and application made?

A. On our part by Romans 5.1
faith alone, and that, not considered as a virtue inherent in us, working by
love, but only as an Romans 10 10
instrument, or hand of the soul stretched forth to lay hold on Christ, Ier.
23.6
The Lord our righteousness.

Q. But how are we made Priests unto God, by our Communion with Christ?

A. Our Ephesians. 1.6.
persons received into favor, we are admitted, as a 1. Pet. 2.5
spiritual Priesthood, to offer up the sacrifices of our obedience and
thanksgiving; which howsoever Esa 64.6.
imperfect in themselves, and deserving rather Psalm. 143.2. Tit. 3.5.
punishment then reward, are yet, as our persons, made acceptable unto GOD, and
have Mat. 10.41, 42.
promise of reward, by the only merit and intercession of the same our high
Priest.

SECT. XXI. Of our Communion with Christ in regard of his Kingly Office, viz.
Glorification: and that begun in this life: and first in our condition.
Q. TO proceed to the third, what benefit receive we by our Communion with
Christ, in regard of his Kingly office?

A. Our Romans 8.30.
Glorification, the third inseparable companion and consequent of our Calling,
and Justification, beforementioned, whereby our condition and whole nature
being changed and restored, according to the Ver. 29.
image of CHRIST our King, we are made in him no less Reu. 1.5.
Kings then Priests, even a 1. Pet. 2.9
royal Priesthood.

Q. How is our Glorification accomplished?

A. It is Col. 3.3, 4
begun in this present life, and shall be perfected in the end of this life,
and in that which is to come; as shall be showed.

Q. How is our Gl^rification begun in this life?

A. Reu. 20.6
Partly in regard of our condition, wherein we are made blessed, and partly in
regard of our nature and conversation, wherein we are made holy.

Q. How are we made blessed in our condition?

A. In that being in Christ, we are in part, 1. Joh. 4.17 1. Cor. 3.22, 23.
admitted into the same relation wherein Christ stands, both with God
himself, and with the creatures, and so invested in his personal
prerogatives; whereby we are gloriously exalted, both in our spiritual, and
outward estate.

Q. Wherein consists the exaltation of our spiritual estate?

A. In that we are not only Col. 3.4. 1. Joh. 3.2.
assured of the fruition of the glorious and blissful presence of God, in
heaven hereafter, but even now in this life, in part, Joh 5.24. 1. Joh. 3.14.
possessed thereof; being admitted unto two degrees of happy communion with
his Majesty.

Q. Which is the first degree?

A. Fellowship with God; whereby Ephesians 2.12.13 and 18.19. 1. Joh. 1.3. Heb.
12.22.23
we, that were once far off, and aliens from him, are now brought into a
near league and confederacy with him, and with his Saints, through the means
of our Lord Jesus Christ; who in our humane nature is styled Zech. 13.7
Gods fellow.

Q. Which is the second degree?

A. Adoption; that is, power and privilege to be called the Ephesians. 1.5.
Sons of God, derived unto us from Christ, Heb. 2.10.
who being the eternal Son of God, became, by incarnation, our Brother, that,
by him, God might bring many sons and daughters unto glory; even as many as
do by faith Joh. 1.12.
receive him; who also by the Gal. 4.5, 6.
spirit of adoption are taught to call God Abba, Father. And thus we, which by
Ephesians. 2.3.
nature were heirs of wrath, are in, and with Christ (the Heb. 1.2.
heir of all things) made Gal. 4 7. Romans 8.17.
heirs of Gods favor and kingdom; procured for us as a purchase, by the
right of justification, and conveyed unto us, as an inheritance, under the
tenure, and title of Adoption.

Q. What ensues upon this, to make us spiritually blessed?

A. 1. Pet. 1.8, 9.
Joy in the holy Ghost, unspeakable and glorious, we being at Romans 5.1, 2 and
14.17.
peace with God, having access by faith unto this grace wherein we stand, and
rejoicing under the hope of the glory of God.

Q. Do the children of God always thus rejoice?

A. Joy, considered as a Psalm. 4.6, 7.
delightful apprehension of the favor of God, gladding the heart, though it
Phil. 4.4.
ought continually to be labored for, and preserved, yet it may be at times,
and for a time, not only darkened and daunted, but even Psalm. 51.12
lost, and to be restored: yet is it, as all Romans 11.29
gifts of God, perpetual and without repentance, if we regard 1. The matter of
rejoicing, which is Gods Mal. 3.6.
unchangeable love and grace. 2. The causes and fountains of joy in the
regenerate, which are the neuer-failing graces of Luc. 22.32
faith, Romans 5.5.
hope, and 1. Cor. 13.8
love, toward God in Christ. 3. The valuation, even in Psalm. 6.8.
deepest dismay, of our part and help in Christ, above the pleasures of ten
thousand worlds. 4. The pretense and claim of the faithful heart, Psalm. 42.5.
promising and challenging unto it self a comfortable Psa. 126.5. and 97.11.
harvest of joy, for the present seed-time of sorrow.


Q. Wherein consists the exaltation of our outward estate?

A. In the 1. Tim. 4.10 Romans 8.32.
promises and blessings of this present life, which are the royalties and
prerogatives of the faithful: only with Mar. 10 38.
reservation (so far as God shall see good) of the condition of the Cross.

Q. What are those prerogatives?

A. They are many and great: but may, for the most part, be referred to five:
whereof the first is Hos. 2.18 Heb. 1.14 and 2.5, 8
Amity with all the creatures, which are a new reconciled and subdued unto the
faithful members of Christ.


Q. What is the second?

A. Gal. 5 13.
Christian liberty; whereby not only our right, forfeited in Adam, is
recovered and restored unto us by Christ, the 1. Cor. 15.47.
second Adam, the Lord from heaven; but also the restraint of the Gal. 5.1. etc
Col. 2.20.
ceremonial law is removed: and now unto the Tit. 1.15
pure, in Christ Jesus, all things are pure, and Romans 14.14
nothing unclean in it self; unless through weakness of conscience in him
that uses them, or in Ver. 15
those that take offense at them, they become accidentally unclean, or
scandalous.

Q. What is the third?

A. Psa. 34.9.10 and Psa. 128.
Sufficiency of earthly comforts, as tokens of Gods love, and pledges of
better things, wherewith many times the godly are so blessed, that they become
Psalm. 21.6
blessings unto others.

Q. What is the fourth?

A. Ps. 31.20 and 37.19
Immunitie from outward evils, as punishments of sin; which yet if, as trials
and chastisements, God inflict upon them, they are assured to find Esaias 27 7
mercy and mitigation in the hand correcting: 1. Cor. 10.13. 2. Cor. 12.9
strength to bear what is laid upon them: the special providence of God
causing all things to Romans 8.28.
work together for the best unto them: and finally, a 1. Cor. 10.13 Psalm. 149.4
glorious issue out of all troubles in due time.

Q. What is the fifth prerogative?

A. Dignity and praeeminence; in that the faithful have Genesis 9.26, 27. Pro.
14.19 Psalm. 105, 14, 15.
dominion and vpperhand over the wicked, their enemies, and are Mar. 6.20 Act.
5.13
honorable in the eyes and hearts of men, though not joining with them in
profession.

Q. What ^nsueth here upon, to make us outwardly blessed?

A. Pro. 10.22
Joy, without mixture of sorrow, in prosperity, and in affliction abundant 2
Cor. 1.5
consolation.

SECT. XXII. Of Glorification begun in our nature, viz. Sanctification.
Q. HOw are we made holy in our nature?

A. By the grace of Sanctification; which is the Tit. 3.5.
renewing of our nature according to the 2. Cor. 3.18 Ephesians. 4.24
image of God, in righteousness and true holiness, making us after a sort 2
Pet. 1.4
partakers of the godly nature.

Q. How far forth, and by whom, is our nature in this life renewed?

A. This renewing is of our 1. These. 5.23 Romans 12.2
whole nature, spirit, soul, and body, our understanding being enlightened,
our will enfranchised, and our outward man reformed; but Ioh. 13.10
not wholly in this life: being the work of Ps. 51.10 Ezekiel. 36.26
God, not of our selves, yet Ezekiel. 18.31
required at our hands, both to show us what we ought to do by the power of
grace, and to stir us up to seek, by prayer and all holy endeavor, to
attain unto that supernatural strength.

Q. By what means is this work of God wrought in us?

A. By the power and Romans 6.5. and ^.2. Joh 15.3 Romans 8.13 Act. 1^.9
efficacy of the death, and resurrection of Christ, conveyed unto us by his
word and Spirit, which being apprehended by faith, and setting faith on work,
are available unto each part of our sanctification.

Q. What are the parts of Sanctification?

A. They are two, according to the powerful means whereby they are wrought,
Viz.

1. Romans 6.6, 7.
Mortification, or dying unto sin, and thereby freedom from the dominion
thereof, by the virtue of the death of Christ. 2. To. 6 4.11
Vivification, or quickening unto newness of life, by the power of the
resurrection of Christ; in regard whereof it is also called our Reu. 20.6.
first resurrection.
Q. How does Sanctification differ from the former grace of Justification?

A. In many maine, and material differences, as 1. In the order, not of time,
wherein they go both Romans 8.30.
together, nor of knowledge and apprehension, wherein this 1. Cor. 6.11
latter has precedence: but of nature, wherein the former is the 2. Cor. 7.1
ground of this latter. 2. In the subject, the righteousness whereby we are
justified, being inherent in Christ for us, but this of sanctification Rom, 8.10
in our selves from him. 3. In the cause, our justification being from the
merit, our sanctification from the Ephesians. 1 19. etc. and 2.1
efficacy, of the death and life of Christ. 4. In the instrument faith, which
in justification is only as an hand receiving, in sanctification a Act. 15.9
Gal. 5.6
co-working virtue. 5. In the measure, Justification being in all believers,
and at all times, alike, but sanctification wrought 2. Cor. 3.18 2. Pet. 3.18
differently and by degrees. 6. In the end, which being in both eternal life;
To. 6.22.23
yet is the one among the causes of reigning, the other only as the high way to
the kingdom.


SECT. XXIII. Of the rule of Sanctification, viz. the Law, with the direction
of the Gospel.
Q. What is the rule and square of our Sanctification?

A. The whole Psalm. 119.9
word of God, as containing that Romans 12.2
will of his, which is 1. These. 4, 3. etc.
even our sanctification.

Q. What mean you by the whole word?

A. Job. 22.22 Ioh. 17.17
Both the Law and Gospel, the old Testament and the new.

Q. Are we not then delivered from the law by the means of Christ?

A. From the Gal. 3.10, 11, 12, 13.
burden of the law, exacting in our own persons perfect obedience, and from
the curse of it, due unto disobedience, we are delivered by Christ:

But from the Commandment, as a Jam. 2.8
rule of life, we are not freed, but contrariwise inclined and disposed, by his
Psalm. 51.12 and 119, 2, 45 1. Ioh. 5.3
free spirit, to the willing obedience thereof. Thus to the regenerate the Law
becomes as it were Gospel; even a Jam. 1.25. and 2.12
law of liberty.

Q. How is the Gospel a rule of obedience, being the rule of faith?

A. The Gospel 1. Tim. 1.11 Ephesians 4.20, 21
directs the faithful to the obedience of the Law: only with difference, 1.
Of the manner, the Law propounding God to be worshipped of us in himself, as
our Creator, the Ioh. 14.1. and 5.23
Gospel in Christ, as our Savior. 2. Of the end, the Law requiring all duties,
as for the procurement of our own salvation, the Gospel in way of 1. These.
5.18
thankfulness for salvation in Christ, already bestowed. 3. Of the effect,
the Law (like Pharaoh, that required brick, but allowed no straw) Romans 10.5,
6. etc.
demanding obedience, but vouchsafing no assistance, (supposing man as in the
state of Creation) but the Gospel both requires, and conferreth faith unto
the Elect, and that not only as a hand to lay hold on Christ; but also as the
chief virtue, working by love in all parts of obedience; without which even
the Gospel is law, that is, a 2. Cor. 3.6
killing letter, as to the unregenerate.


Q. Does not the Gospel add other precepts, or counsels to those of the law?

A. Not any other, in substance of action, but only renews and enforces 1.
Ioh. 2.7, 8
those of the law: and specifyeth some duties, as of faith in the Messiah, of
the Sacraments etc. which have their general ground from the law. As for
those, that are propounded in form of counsel, and do concern things
indifferent, they are not Reu. 3.18
therefore arbitrary courses of higher perfection (much less meritorious of
greater glory) but, as they are applied with due circumstances, necessary
precepts, referred to some one or other commandment of the law; the Mat 19 23
rejecting whereof excludes from the kingdom of God.

Q. What is that law, which with the direction of the Gospel, is the rule of
Sanctification?

A. Only the moral law, or law of nature, engraven by God himself, first in
the heart of man in his creation, after in Deuteronomy. 10.4
tables of stone, in the days of Moses, and so published, and committed unto
the Church for all ages, as the Iam. 2.8
royal law, for obedience to God our King, commonly called the Exodus 34.28
Deuteronomy. 4.13
Decalogue, or ten Commandments.

Q. What are we to conceive of the Ceremonial and judicial laws?

A. They are only added as special explications and applications of the law
moral, unto Romans 9.4
that present Church and people of the Israelites: Viz.

The former for direction in rites of outward worship, Heb. 10.1. etc.
shaddowing the grace of the Gospel, now utterly Ver. 9.
abolished, the substance being exhibited: The latter for form of policy, and
civil government, and therefore ceasing with the dissolution of that common
wealth, for which it was ordained.
SECT. XXIIII. Of the Decalogue.
Q. TO deal only therefore with the moral ^aw, what order are we to observe
in handling of the Decalogue?

A. We are to consider First in general, The preface. The division. The rules
of interpretation.
Secondly the several Commandments in particular.


Q. What is the preface of the Law?

A. Those words of God, Exodus ^0.2
I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the
house of bondage. Wherein he lays a twofold ground of obedience, Viz.

1. From his name Exodus 3.14.
Jehovah importing his eternal being of himself, and Romans 11.36
communicating of life and all blessings to mankind, whereby he is the Psalm.
36.6
Savior of all men. 2. From the Covenant of grace, whereby he is our God, the
1. Tim. 4.10.
Savior of them that believe; assuring them all gracious deliverances, by
virtue of that his covenant, from all evils and enemies, both bodily, and
especially spiritual, under the figure of the late deliverance of the
Israelites out of Egypt.
Q. How is the Law divided?

A. Two ways: 1. Into ten Commandments, or words, propounded Some
affirmatively, as the 4. and 5. others negatiuely, as all the rest. Some with
reasons annexed, as the 2, 3, 4, 5: the rest without.
2. Into two Tables, which Math. 22.
Christ calls the two great Commandments, viz. the 1. Containing our Verse
37.38.
duty to God in the four first Commandments. 2. Our Verse 39.
duty to our neighbor, in the 6. last.



Q. What are the rules of interpreting the Law?

A. They are principally these three, viz.

1. That where any Matthew. 4.10. 1. Cor. 15.34.
duty is enjoined, as in the affirmative Commandments, the contrary sin
is forbidden: and where any Ephesians. 4.28.
sin is forbidden, as in the negative, the contrary duty is required. 2.
That under Matthew. 5.21, 22, etc. 1. John 3.15.
one maine duty, or crime expressed, all degrees of good, or evil in the
same kind, are either commanded, or forbidden. 3. That with the sin
forbidden, or duty enjoined, all These. 5.22 Heb. 10 24, 25.
occasions, or furtherances thereto, are consequently condemned, or required.
SECT. XXV. Of the first Commandment.
Q. TO come to the several Commandments, and first of the former Table; What
are the words of the first Commandment?

A. Exodus 20.3.
Thou shall have none other gods before me.

Q. What is the scope and meaning of this Commandment?

A. That the inward and spiritual worship of the Prou 23.26
heart, wherein Deuteronomy. 5.29
God especially delights, and which is the Prou 4.23. Mat. 12.35.
ground of the outward, be given to him the only God, and to none other; and
that sincerely without hypocrisy, as in his sight, who Jer. 17.10.
searches and knows the heart.

Q. What is forbidden in this Commandment?

A. 1. Original corruption, so far forth as it is the Romans 8.7.
fountain of impiety against God: with all the streams of Psalm. 14.1.
Atheism, error, Ps. 10.3, 4.
hatred of God, profaneness, presumption, security, infidelity, Romans 1.21.
ingratitude, etc. 2. All inward Idolatry, whereby men set up an Ezekiel. 14.3
Idol in their heart, in stead of God, giving thereto any part of spiritual
adoration; as by Acts 12.23
pride, 2. Tim. 3.4 1. Sam. 2.29.
inordinate love, ^sa. 51.12, 13.
carnal fear, Pro. 18.11 Ier. 17.5.
fleshly confidence, etc.


Q. What is required in this Commandment?

A. The setting up, and Esa. 8.13.
sanctifying of the Lord God in our hearts, yielding him, in Christ, the
spiritual worship of Psalm. 73.25.
faith and affiance, Deuteronomy. 6.5.
love, and 1 Thessalonians. 5.18.
thankfulness, Heb. 12.28
fear and reverence, etc. which is due unto his Majesty.

Q. What are the helps or hindrances of the obedience of this Commandment?

A. 1. The only means to settle and uphold us in this spiritual worship of
God, is to endeavor to attain and increase in the 2. Pet. 3.18
knowledge of him in Jesus Christ: to consider Psalm. 116.1, 12 1. Ioh. 3.1.
what great things he has done for us: yea Pro. 3.6.
in all our ways to take knowledge of his presence, promises, and providence.
2. Contrariwise, the Hos. 4.1. and 8.12.
neglect of the knowledge of God, and Esa 5.12. and 26.10, 11.
not considering his word, and works, are the Esa. 1.3, 4.
ground of all impiety, and spiritual Idolatry, here forbidden.


SECT. XXVI. Of the second Commandment.
Q. What are the words of the second Commandment?

A. Exodus 20.4, etc.
Thou shall make thee no graven image, neither any similitude, etc.

Q. What is the scope and meaning of this Commandment?

A. To bind all men to that Deuteronomy. 12.32
only outward form of worship, which God himself in his word prescribes;
and that by a twofold reason:

The first taken from the Covenant of grace, whereby he is the Lord our God:
which Covenant on our part is by no sin so directly violated, as by
Idolatry, called therefore in Scripture spiritual Ier. 3.8.
Adultery:

The second, from the nature of God, which is, in this case to be jealous;
which he shows 1. By visiting, and punishing, unto the third and fourth
generation, such as (howsoever pretending love) do thus declare their hatred of
him: 2. By extending his mercy unto thousands of such, as show their love of
him, by obedience to this his Law.


Q. What is forbidden in this Commandment?

A. Every form of worship, Deuteronomy. 12.31.
though of the true God, Mat. 15.9.
contrary to, or diverse from, the prescript of Gods word; called by the
Apostle Col. 2.23.
Well-worship: together with all 2. Kin. 16.10
corruptions in the true worship of God, and all lust and inclination of heart,
unto superstitious pompes and rites in the service of God. All these the Lord
forbids under one instance of Ps. 97.7.
Images, wherein he foresaw there would be greatest abuse, and therefore
expressly condemns, 1. The Deuteronomy. 4.15, etc. Hab. 2.18.
making of any Images to represent God, or for religious use. 2. The
worshipping of them, or of Exodus 32.5.
God in them, or using of any Esaias 44.15 Exodus 32.4.
gestures of religious adoration unto them.


Q. What is required in this Commandment?

A. That we perform, with diligence, and Eccl. 4.17. and 5.1, etc.
reverence, all parts of Gods outward worship prescribed, whether Ordinary, as
Act. 2.42.
hearing, and reading the word, Prayer, the use of the Sacraments, the
Discipline and censures of the Church: Or extraordinary, as Joel 2.12, 15.
fasts public or private, solemn Psalm. 50.14
thanksgiving for special blessings, together with vows, lots, and oaths, etc.


Q. What are the helps or hindrances of the obedience of this Commandment?

A. It is required, unto the obedience of this Commandment; 1. That all men
labor for Mic. 6.6, 7.8.
knowledge of the express will of God touching all parts of his worship, and
join together with 1. Cor. 14.40
order and decency in the performance thereof: And that such, whom it
concerns, take care that faithful and able Tit. 1.5, etc.
Ministers be ordained in every congregation, and that sufficient 1. Tim.
5.17, 18.
maintenance, for 2. Chr. 31.4
encouragement, be allotted them: That Luke 7 5, 6.
places for public assemblies be erected and preserved: That 2 King. 6.1, etc.
Schools and Universities be founded and maintained: That 1. Sam. 10.25.
Books of necessary use unto edification (especially the Revel. 1.3.
holy Book of God) be set sorth and divulged: That, as occasion requires,
Synods and Act 15.6.
Councils be called and assembled, etc. Finally, that such, whose calling and
ability reaches no farther, do yet afford the help of their Mat. 9.38.
prayers unto all these. 2. That no Col. 2.18.
power be admitted in the Church to prescribe other forms of worship, no 2.
Cor. 6.14
affinity or society with Idolaters, no 2. Chro. 15 13, 16 Reu. 2.20
toleration of superstition, no 1. Cor. 10, 20, 21
presence at Idolatrous worship be afforded: no relics, or monuments of
Idolatry, as 2. Kin. 18.4.
Images, Act. 19.19
books, Psalm. 16.4
names, and such like be retained.


SECT. XXVII. Of the third Commandment.
Q. What are the words of the third Commandment?

A. Exo. 20.7.
Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, etc.

Q. What is the meaning of this Commandment?

A. That we impeach not, but by all means advance, the glorious Psalm. 29.2
name of God, in all things, whereby he makes himself known to men, as his
holy Psalm. 68.4
titles, and attributes, Psalm. 138.2
word, and Ps. 145.10.
works: and that under a dreadful penalty viz. that howsoever man's law, for
the most part, takes not hold of offenders in this kind, yet God will not
Psalm. 1.5
acquit them, nor suffer them to escape his righteous, and fearful Zech. 5.3.
Iam. 5 12
Judgment.

Q. What is forbidden in this Commandment?

A. Every Mal. 1.6, 12
wrong offered to the name and glory of God, as namely Tit. 1.16
hypocrisy: the Romans 1.24
evil life of professors: Mat. 10.33
shrinking in case of peril, and denying God the honor of our suffering for
him: abusing his word, or any part thereof, unto 2. Pet. 3.16
idle and curious questions, Esaias 22.13
jesting and profane mirth, defense of Mat. 4.6.
error, Act. 19.13.
charms or sorceries: etc. Vnreuerent mention of his titles, as Lord, God,
Jesus, etc. in foolish admiration, idle wishes, G^n. 16.5 2. S^m. 16.8.
imprecations, and cursings, etc. Job. 3 2, 3 etc.
murmuring at his providence, under the names of fortune and chance: Deuteronomy. 29 19
presuming upon his mercy, to harden our hearts in sinning: cauilling at the
doctrine of To. 9.19, 20
predestination etc. not Act. 17.27.
seeing God in his works, or not using them as we ought. Finally in an oath,
whether by swearing by an Zeph. 1.5. Amo. 8.14
Idol: or by calling God for a witness, either of vain and frivolous things
by Jam. 5.12 Ier. 23.10.
usual swearing, or of our furious anger by 1. Sam. 14.39 2. Kin. 6.31
passionate swearing, or of an untruth, by Leu. 19.12. Zech. 5.4.
forswearing.

Q. What is required in this Commandment?

A. Whatsoever may advance Gods glory; as the Tit. 2.10 Mat. 5 16
holy conversation of professors: Reu. 2 13
confession of Christ unto suffering, yea martyrdom, if cause be: reverent
Pro. 31.26 Psalm. 71.15
mention of the titles, attributes, word, and works of God; especially
observing and recounting, what Psalm. 66.16 and 103.23, etc.
special mercies he has vouchsafed us in particular: receiving, and using
all the creatures of God to his glory, with thanksgiving: Finally, in the
matter of an oath, when we swear 1. In Ier. 4.2
truth, affirming what we know to be true, and Psalm. 15.4. and 24.4
verifying by deed what we undertake. 2. In judgment, which is a due
consideration both of the nature, and greatness of an oath, wherein God is
taken to 2. Cor. 1, 23
witness against the soul of the swearer, if he deceive: and of the due
calling, and warrant of an oath, whether public, being demanded by the Genesis
43.3 1. Sam. 24.22, 23
Magistrate, without peril to the swearer, or Exo. 22.11. 1. Sam. 20.17 2.
Cor. 1, 23
private, in case of great importance, when the truth cannot otherwise be
cleared. 3. In righteousness, that is, both in the due form viz. by Mat. 5.34
^. Esaias 25.16 Jer. 2 ^6
God alone, not by any creature, or Idol: and to a right end, which is the
Esaias 45.23 with Phil. ^ ^^
glory of God, and Heb. 6.16
peace among men.


Q. What are the helps or hindrances of the obedience of this Commandment?

A. First, that we both enure our hearts to ^^ut. 28.58 E^cles. 9.2
fear and reverence the great and dreadful name of the Lord our God, and
keep a careful watch over our Psalm. 39.1
lips, and lives, least by any means we dishonor him.

government, one day, (and now since the resurrection of Christ the first) of
the seven, in every week, to be set apart unto an holy rest, for Gods
public and solemn worship; and that upon a fourefold reason: 1. From
equity, because God allows us six days for our affairs, and reserueth but
one for himself. 2. From his own right, because this day is his and not ours.
3. From his example, who on the seventh day rested from his work of Creation.
4. From hope of blessing, because God has blessed, and sanctified the Sabbath
not only as a day of service to himself, but also as a time and Exodus 31.13
Esaias 56.6, 7.
means to bestow increase of grace upon such, as do conscionably observe the

A. Three, Viz.

1. To remember the Sabbath day: that is not only to look back unto the Genesis
1.2, 3
first sanction of it in Paradise, before all sacrifices and ceremonies (which
reason, among many others, may persuade, that it is not ceremonial, but
perpetual, not to cease till it be perfectly Heb. 4.9.10
consummated in the heavenly Sabbath) but also so to bear it in mind, as to
live in continual practice of the duties we learned the Sabbath past, and
Luke 23.54
preparation of our selves, and our affairs, that we may freely and duly
attend on the Lord in the Sabbath approaching. 2. To Esaias 58.13
make it our delight, to consecrate it as glorious to the Lord, performing,
with care, and desire of profit, the duties thereof in public and private: to
wit: Of Act. 13.13, 15 Psalm. 92 See the title.

of God, especially feeding our souls with the contemplation of the heavenly
Sabbath, etc. Of 1. Cor. 16.2 Nehe. 8.12
mercy, as collections for the poor, visiting the sick, comforting the sad,
reconciling such as are at variance: and such like. Wherein such, as are
necessarily debarred from the public duties must, with Mat. 24.20 Psalm. 42.6
sorrow for such restraint, use more carefully the Psalm. 63.1, 2
private means.
3. To Exodus 34.21 and 31.13
rest from our ordinary, though lawful businesses, for the space of that whole
natural day; yea to allow rest to the very cattle, both that we may show Pro.
12.10
mercy, even to the beast, and to represent, after a sort, the everlasting
Sabbath, wherein all To. 8.20, 21
creatures shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption: Notwithstanding
such works are excluded, as are presently necessary, either for the Act. 1.12

a common day through common Neh. 13.15. etc.
labor in our ordinary callings, Esaias 58.13.

but a common use of the creatures. 2. By making it a day of carnal rest, unto
idleness, Exodus 32.6.
feasting, pastimes etc. Which draw our minds farther from God, then our
ordinary labors. 3. By making it a day of sin, or the Devils holiday, doing
that on the Lords day, which is Mar. 3.4.

abominable. 4. By being Amos 8.5. Mal. 1.1^
weary of the duties of the Sabbath, thinking long till they be ended.

hence comes he to Psalm 97.10.
hate his sin, as God hates it, and to look back thereon with 2. Cor. 7.1^
godly sorrow, resolving for ever after to forsake all his sins, and to live
in new obedience.

Q. When is this Repentance to be ^actised of us?

A. The practice of Repentance ^ught to be a continual Romans 12.9
abhorring of evil, and cleaving unto that which is good, for as much 1. Pet.
4.2, 3
time as remains in the flesh after conversion: yet, at times there ought to
be a more special practice and renewing thereof, as Psalm. 31
after great falls, in Amos 4.12.
fear of imminent judgments, or when we would Genesis 35.2, 3 etc.
fit our selves to receive special mercies.

Q. In what manner must the special practice of Repentance, in such cases, be
performed?

A. There must be 1. A serious Lam. 3.40.
search and inquiry after all sins, as Traitors against God; but especially
Ier. 8.6 Psalm. 18.23
special sins, as the Arch-Rebels. 2. Humble confession of sins; and that
1. Of necessity unto GOD, with Pro. 28.13 Ier. 31.18, 19
shame of face, and true sorrow of heart. 2. Unto men conditionally; Viz. if
either the Church, for 2. Cor. 2.6.
satisfaction of the public offense, do enioine open acknowledgement: or some
Luke 17.4
personal wrong demand private reconciliation: or the weakness of the
laboring conscience do require the secret Iam. 1.16.
assistance of a faithful, and able, Minister, or Brother. 3. Fervent and
faithful Psalm. 51.1, 2 etc.
prayer to God in Christ both for Ver. 7.
pardon of what is past, and for supply of Ver. 10.
renewing grace, for the time to come.



Q. Seeing many do falsely pretend that they repent, how may we know that our
Repentance is true?

A. A true trial of unfeigned Repentance may be taken 1. From the generality
of it, Viz. if it extend to the abhorring and shunning of Ps. 119.128 and 139.24
all sins, and to the love and practice of Psalm. 119.6.
all duties, without reservation. 2. From the through performance of each part,
Viz. 1. Of hatred of sin in spiritual warfare against it, and that even unto
Heb. 12.4
blood if need be. 2. Of the love of righteousness, in bringing forth Mat.
3.8.
fruits worthy of amendment of life, to wit, good works.



SECT. XXXVI. Of the Spiritual warfare.
Q. What is the Spiritual warfare?

A. The daily exercise of our spiritual strength, and armor against all
adversaries, with assured confidence of victory.

Q. What is our spiritual strength?

A. The powerful Ephesians. 6.10
assistance of God in Christ, who has loved us, whereby we become Romans 8.37
more then conquerors.

Q. What is our spiritual armor?

A. The complete furniture of saving and sanctifying graces; called therefore
the 2. Cor. 6.7.
armor of righteousness, and the Ephesians. 6.11
Panoplie or whole armor of God Viz.

The Ver. 14. etc
girdle of verity, or sincerity. The breast plate of Righteousness, that is,
holiness of life, and good conscience. The shoes of the preparation (or
resolution to go through with the profession) of the Gospel of peace. The
shield of Faith. The helmet of the hope of Salvation. The sword of the Spirit,
which is the (sound knowledge and wise application of the) word of God. Finally
continual, and instant prayer in the Spirit.
Q. Who are our adversaries in the spiritual conflict?

A. They are either our friend proving us, or our enemies seducing and
endangering us.

Q. Who is that friend of ours, that for our probation enters into conflict
with us?

A. God himself, who though he Jam. 1.13
tempt no man unto evil (no more then he can himself be tempted) yet, as a
Master of defense, enureth us to the conflict, by contending with us, even in
his own person. Viz.

Sometimes by Genesis 22.1, etc.
Probatorie commandments, or Ge. 32.24
Sensible apparitions.
But more ordinarily by Job 6.4.
striking our hearts with his terrors, Psalm. 77.7
withdrawing the comfort of his gracious presence, 2. Chro. 32.31.
leaving us, for a time, to our selves, that by our falls we may acknowledge
our own weakness: Finally Heb. 12.5, 6 Reu. 3.19.
exercising us under the cross, and yoke of outward afflictions.
Q. How must we contend with God?

A. No otherwise, then Hos. 12.3.4
Jacob, and other holy men have done, that is, by obedience, humility,
patience, and fervent prayer unto God; who only enableth us to prevail with
himself, Genesis 32.28.
giving us the blessing, and name of Israel.

Q. What are those enemies of ours, that seek to seduce and endanger us?

A. Whatsoever marches under the banner of Satan, the 2. Cor. 4.4
God and Ephesians. 6.12
Prince of the darkness of this world, who sometimes 2. Cor. 12.7 Zech. 3.1
immediately assaileth us with impious and odious suggestions, but more usually
employeth his forces, or attendants.

Q. What are the attendants of Satan?

A 1. The 1. Ioh. 2.15.
world, which he abuses as his storehouse, and armorie of temptations, that
is, both Ver. 16
allurements to evil with hope of gain, pleasure, or preferment, and Ioh. 16.33
discouragements from duty, with fear of loss, trouble, reproach, etc. 2.
Our own Gal. 5.24.
flesh, which as a treacherous party within us, being by Satan stirred up, and
inueigled with the baits of the world, or discouraged with the evil entreaty
thereof, 1. Pet. 2.11
fights on his side against our soul, that is, our spiritual life and
welfare.


Q. How do these enemies fight against our soul?

A. By employing all force, and fraud, to draw us by sin, from the 1. Ioh.
2.25
obedience, and favor of God, unto damnation.

Q. What must we do being thus assailed?

A. We must Ephesians. 6.13, 14
stand fast, being strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, and
taking unto us the whole armor of God, that we may be able to resist in the
evil day, and to lead our captivity captive.

Q. How may we be able to stand against the assaults of the Devil?

A. 1. We must labor to 2. Cor. 2.11
inform our selves, that we may not be ignorant of his enterprises, or
stratagemes. 2. We must boldly Iam. 4 7. 1. Pet. 5.9
resist, that is, Ephesians. 4 27.
give no place or ground unto him, or admit any conference with him, but rather
neglect and despise his suggestions. 3. We must take the Ephesians. 6.16.
shield of Faith in Christ, and his assistance ( Psalm. 16.8
setting him on our right hand, who is Esaias 6 3.1.
mighty to save,) whereby we may quench all the fiery darts of that wicked
one. 4. We must brandish against him the Ephe. 6.17.
sword of the Spirit, that is the word of God, after the example of our Mat.
4.4, etc.
Savior, keeping our selves to that only, which God reuealeth to us, and
requires of us.


Q, How may we withstand temptations from the world?

A. By our 1 John 5.4
faith, which sets a better world, even Gods heavenly kingdom, before our
eyes, and so enableth us, both to Heb. 11.24, etc.
contemn and Gal. 6.14
crucify the love of this present world, and to Heb. 11 36, 37.
endure manfully, the threats and wrongs thereof, both confessing Christ in
peril, and suffering Reu. 12.11
martyrdom for his sake, if we be thereto called.

Q. How may we withstand the temptations of our own flesh?

A. By 1. Pet. 4 1.
setting before our eyes the pattern of the death of Christ, and arming our
selves with the same mind, that it behooves us also to suffer in the flesh,
ceasing from sin; hereto craving and employing the power of the same death of
Christ, to To. 6, 2. etc
subdue and crucify our carnal lusts and affections; whereto also belongs
the help of 1. Cor. 9.25, etc.
Abstinence for the repressing of the inordinate desires of nature.

SECT. XXXVII. Of good works in general.
Q. THus far of the spiritual warfare: What is a good work?

A. Whatsoever thing is done of us, 2. Cor. 3.5.
not by the force or conduct of nature, but by the power of the Romans 8.10
spirit of Christ, dwelling in us, and according to the rule of the Romans 12.2
known will of God, unto the 1 Cor. 10.31
glory of God, the 2. Pet. 1.10, etc.
assurance of our election, and the 1. Cor. 10.23
edification of others.

Q. Is there no concurrence of nature, in the doing of a good work?

A. Taking nature (in the common sense of Scripture) for that Ephesians. 2.3 1.
Cor. 2.14
hereditarie corruption, that cleaves to all the sons of Adam, Romans 8.7
no good work has any ground or help from nature, but is altogether contrary
thereto: but if we understand by Romans 2.14
nature, the created abilities of soul, and body, as the light of reason,
liberty of will, motion of the bodily members etc. we acknowledge nature to
be Mat. 16.17
not the principal mouer, or guide, but the 1. These. 5.23
thing moved, and guided by grace, in well doing.

Q. Are there any works of men perfectly good?

A. None, no not of the most perfect, in this life, by reason of the Esaias 64.6
Gal. 15.17.
remainders of corruption, but only the works of Christ, in whom alone there
was 1. Pet. 2.22
no mixture of sin.

Q. Can all men do good works?

A. No, but only the regenerate, who are, for that purpose, Ephesians. 2.10 2.
Tim. 2.21
created a new, and endued in measure, with the spirit of Christ, and power of
his resurrection: As for the unregenerate, they are Mat. 7 17, etc. Jer. 13.23.
the evil tree, that brings forth only evil fruit.

Q. Are there not some good works, specially commended to us in the word of
God?

A. Yes: and namely, among the duties of the first Table, Prayer, and among
those of the second Table, Alms; touching which therefore our Mat. 6.1.5, etc.
Savior gives special directions in the sixth of Matthew.

Q. Is not fasting also (of which our Savior in the Math. 6.16, etc.
same place entreats) a special good work?

A. Fasting is not properly a good work, but an help, and assistance thereto,
namely to Prayer, as shall appear.

SECT. XXXVIII. Of Prayer.
Q. TO proceed then; What is prayer?

A. It is the Phil. 4.6.
request of an humble, and sanctified heart, together with thanksgiving,
offered by the power of the Romans 8.26.
spirit of prayer, as a special Psalm. 50.15
service unto God, in the Ioh. 14.14.
name of Christ, in behalf of our selves, and Ephesians. 6.18.
others, with 1 John 5.14
assurance to be heard, in what we pray for, according to the will of God.

Q. Why do you call it a request with thanksgiving?

A. Because in all our prayers, there must be both 1 Thessalonians 5.17.
petition of the good things we need, and Verse 18.
thankful acknowledgement of those we have obtained: As for those forms,
which contain neither supplication, nor giving of thanks (as the Articles of
our faith, the Decalogue etc.) they may and ought, for other good purposes, be
committed to memory and Deuteronomy 6.7.
rehearsed, but to use them as prayers, M^^h. 6 7.
sauoreth of deep ignorance, if not of superstition.

Q. Why do you call it the request of the heart?

A. Not to exclude the use of bodily gesture, much less of the voice and
tongue, in the action of invocation; (therefore called the Hos. 24.3.
Calves of the lips) but to show 1. That the 1. Cor. 14.15. Psalm. 45.1 and
108.1.
heart is, on our part, the first, and principal moouer, and speaker in
prayer, from whence both voice and gesture have their force, and grace. 2. That
prayer, in sudden occasions, may be Exodus 14.15 Nehem. 2.4.
secretly, and powerfully offered, and is of God accepted, and heard, when
neither any voice is uttered, nor any bodily gesture employed.


Q. Why do you add, of an humble, and sanctified heart?

A. Because, as in general, Psalm. 109.7
none can pray or do any thing acceptably, but such as are truly regenerate,
and Psalm. 51.15
sanctified unto this, and every good work: so in special (and for the
present action of prayer) it is required as the Psalm. 51.17
sum of all sacrifices, that the heart be humble, and contrite, Dan. 9, 8, 9
acknowledging it own unworthiness, by reason of sin, Psalm. 143.6
feeling the want of Gods grace and mercy, and Luke 15.18, 19.
submitting it self unto him, willing to be beholding for the least degree of
favor.

Q. What is the spirit of prayer?

A. An especial grace and operation of the Jude verse 20.
holy Ghost (called therefore the Zech. 12.10.
spirit of grace and deprecation) enabling us to Psalm. 62.8
power out our souls unto the Lord, with Romans 8.26.
sighs, that cannot be expressed.

Q. Are we to direct our prayers to God alone?

A. Yea, to one God in Trinity, and to none other: for he alone 1. As the
searcher of the hearts, Psalm 65.2
hears the voice, and Romans 8.27.
knows the meaning of the spirit of prayer. 2. Is Ephesians. 3.20.
able to grant whatsoever we demand. 3. Challenges our Romans 10.14
faith, and confidence, without which we cannot pray.


For which causes, the Scripture allows not prayer to any other.

Q. In whose name, or for whose sake, must we sue to God?

A. In the only Dan. 9.17. Joh. 16.23.24.
name and for the only sake, of his son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the alone 1.
Tim. 2.5.
mediator between God and man, as of 1. Joh. 2.1, 2 Romans 8.34.
propitiation, so of 1. Joh. 2.1, 2 Romans 8.34.
intercession; who through the Heb. 10.19, etc.
veil of his flesh, and merit of his blood, has prepared for us a new, and
living way, whereby we may be bold to enter into the holy place: in Gal. 4.5.
whom alone we are made children of God, and have liberty to call him Father;
Finally in, with, and for Romans 8.32.
whom, God gives all good things to his Elect.

Q. For whom are we to pray?

A. For our selves, and others: us, and ours: In a word 1. For 1. Tim. 2.1.
all men, even our Math. 5.44.
enemies, because of the common Iam. 3.9.
image of God, and Act. 17.26.
blood of mankind, whereof we are all made; unless it be apparent, that 1.
Ioh. 5.16.
any one has committed the unpardonable sin: but Gal. 6.10. Ephesians. 6.18.
principally for those of the household of faith. 2. For all 1. Tim. 2.2.
sorts and degrees of men; especially public persons, as rulers, and such as
are in authority: Ephesians 6.19. Col 4.3.
ministers, that watch over our souls etc.


Q. What assurance have we, that we shall be heard in what we pray for?

A. Because we pray to that God, that Psalm. 65.2
hears the Prayer, and is the Heb. 11.6.
rewarder of all that come unto him, and in Ioh. 11.42
his name, to whom God denies nothing; and therefore howsoever we are not
always answered at the Psalm. 77.3
present, or in the 2. Cor 12.9
same kind, that we desire, yet sooner or later, we are sure to receive, even
above that we are able to ask, or think; if we continue, Luc 11.5, etc. and
18.1.
with constancy, patience, and importunity, to sue unto him according to his
will.

SECT. XXXIX. Of the Lords Prayer, the perfect form and plat-forme of Prayer:
and of the preface thereof.
Q. Where is that will of God revealed, according whereto we must direct our
Prayers?

A. Throughout the whole book of the Scriptures of God; which inform us, as
concerning other duties, so especially concerning this of prayer, recording
also for this purpose, many excellent prayers, as of Moses, David, Nehemiah,
Paul, etc. but most absolutely in that passage, or portion, delivered by our
Savior himself, and propounded by his holy Evangelists, Matthew, and Luke; by
the Math. 6.9.
one as the most perfect platform, to be imitated; by the Luke 11.2
other, as the most excellent form, to be used of all Christians; and
therefore commonly called the Lords Prayer.

Q. What are the words of the Lords Prayer?

A. Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

Q. What are the parts of this Prayer?

A. They are three Viz.

1. A preface of compellation, for entrance into Prayer, in the first words,
Our Father which art in heaven. 2. A body of petitions, containing the matter
of Prayer, in the words following. 3. A conclusion for confirmation and close
of Prayer, in the last words, For thine is the kingdom etc.
Q. To begin with the preface, why does our Savior direct us, to give such
titles unto God, in the entrance of our prayers?

A. That thereby we may testify, increase, and strengthen our faith in God,
considering Heb. 11.6
what he is to us, to whom we are about to pray.

Q. What are we to consider from this, that we are taught to call God [Our
Father?]

A. We are hereby directed to meditate upon a two-sold relation:

The first between our selves and God, who in Christ is become our Father, and
gives us both the Ioh 1.12.
privilege, and Gal 4.6
spirit of sons, so to call him; from whence arises, not only confidence in
his Ps. 103.13
fatherly love and compassion toward us, as his children, but also necessity
of duty, on our parts, that we both Mal. 1.6^
honor and Mat. 5.45
imitate him, as our Ephesians. 5.1 1. Pet. 1.17
Father.

The second between our selves, and so many as are, or may be, Children of the
same Father with us; with whom therefore at all times; ( Mat 5 23, ^^. 1. T^m.
2.8.
especially when we make our prayers) we must maintain, or renew, love and
peace: and for all whom, as for our selves, we are to be suitors unto our God,
and Father, and they in like manner for us; that, every one praying for all,
and all for every one; we may jointly increase, and enjoy the benefit of the
common slocke of prayers laid up in the hands of God.

Q. Whereto do the words following direct us, when we say [which art in
heaven?]

A. To the meditation of the glory, powerful providence, wisdom, and
holiness of God, in which regards he is Psalm. 11.4. Esaias 57.^5
said to dwell in the high and holy place: not that he is excluded from, or
included in any plate (who Ier 23 24
fills all places, yea 1. Kin. 8.27.
whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain) but 1. Because his wisdom,
power, and glory appears most evidently in the rule of the Ps. 14.1, etc and
8.3.
heavens, as of the most excellent bodily creatures, Ps. 103.19.
by which inferior natures are ruled. 2. Because Ps. 123.1. Col. 3.1, 2
there, and not on earth, we should now seek him, where also we hope, another
day, to dwell with him, in the same happy fellowship, which now the holy
Angels, and blessed souls do enjoy. 3. To teach us to pray Eccles. 5.1
reverently before him, who is so high above us, yea fervently also, that our
prayers may 2. Chro. 32.20.
ascend into heaven. 4. That acknowledging him to ride on the heavens for our
help, Psalm. 125 3
able (as in heaven) to do for us, whatsoever (as a Father) he will, we
might, with full confidence in his power and love, ask Psalm. 2.8 Luc. 11.13
every good thing of him.


SECT. XL. Of the first Petition.
Q. TO come to the body, and matter of prayer; How many Petitions are there in
the Lords Prayer?

A. Six; whereof the three first are referred to things concerning GOD, Ioh.
12.27, 28.
whose glory and service we are to prefer before our own good: the three
latter, to things concerning our selves, Psa. 50.15.
which we must refer to the former.

Q. To begin therefore with those that concern God; What are the words of the
first Petition?

A. Mat. 6.9. Luke 11.2.
Hallowed be thy Name.

Q. What is the meaning of these words?

A 1. By the Name of God we are to understand God Esaias 26.8
himself, as he makes known to us the fame, and glory of his nature,
otherwise Genesis 32.29
inconceivable, whether by his Exodus 3 14* and 6.3.
Titles, as Jehovah, Elohim, etc. or Exo. 33.28, 19. etc. and 34.5, 6. etc.
Attributes, as of love, wisdom, power, justice, etc. which being essential
in him, are for our capacity, expressed under the names of such qualities in
us: or Memorials, as his works of Psalm. 104.
creation, and providence, but especially Psalm. 19.14
redemption: or his Psa. 138.2. and 19.7. etc
word (and worship) which is the book of grace, and the box of ointment, out
of which the sweet Cant. 1.2
savor of his name, is most effectually powered.
2. By [hallowing] we must understand, the separating of the name of God, from
all profane and unholy abuse: not by adding any holiness thereto, but by Psalm.
96.8.
acknowledging and honoring it for such; whereby we do, as it were, set the
crown of holiness and honor upon the head of God. Contrariwise, failing so
to do, we are guilty of the profanation of Gods holy name: not that he can
receive any pollution from us, but only as the man, that lusts after a chaste
woman, is said, by our Mat 5.28.
Savior, to be guilty of adultery with her, though she remain, in her
self, spotless, and undefiled.


Q. What do we then ask of God in this Petition?

A. Two things, Viz.

1. That he would vouchsafe to plant, and increase in us, and others, such
graces whereby his name may be glorified, as Psalm. 100.3 and 67.^.
knowledge of God, Psa. 115.1.
humility, thankfulness, patience: Ps. 51.15 and 45.1.
lips opened, and tongues tuned to speak of him with reverence: Finally a Mat.
5.16 1. Pet. 2.^ Tit. 2.10
life so ordered, that men may say, he is an holy God, who, by his grace,
makes us an holy people. 2. That he would remove, and root out of our hearts,
tongues, and lives, all such vices, by and for which his name is dishonored,
as Pro 8.13
pride, profanenes, Hos. 8.12
ignorance, infidelity, Romans 1.21
unthankfulness, impatience etc. those tongue-wormes of Exodus 20.7
swearing, blasphemy, and vnreuerent speaking of him: Finally To 2.23, 24
evil and scandalous life, for which the name of God, and his religion, is
evil spoken of in the world.
SECT. XLI. Of the second Petition.
Q. What are the words of the second Petition?

A. Math. 6.10 Luc. 11.2.
Thy Kingdom come.

Q. What is the meaning of these words?

A. First by the Kingdom of God we must understand, not that Es^. 6.5. Psa.
95.3. etc.
universal soueraignety which, as Creator, he exercises over all creatures,
disposing them all unto their proper ends for his glory: but the Psalm. 110.2
1. Cor. 15.25
spiritual regiment of the Church (and of all things for the good of the
Church) wherein God has appointed Psalm. 2.6. Hos. 3.5.
Christ to be the King, the R^uel. 15.3.
saints his subjects, the Job 22.22.
word his law, the Heb. 1.6.
Angels, and all creatures his servants, the 2. Cor. 5.20
Ministers his Heralds, and Ambassadors: finally the Mat. 12.26.
devils kingdom, that is, wicked Angels, and men ( Luc. 19 27.
enemies to the Kingdom of Christ) his Psalm. 110.1.
footstool.

Secondly this Kingdom is said to come, 1 In regard of means, where the Math
12.28, and 13 19. Mat. 1.15.
word of the Kingdom is published. 2 In regard of efficacy, where Romans 6.17.
from the heart obedience is yielded. 3 In regard of perfection it has these
degrees: Viz. Math. 13.8.
Increase of grace in the time of this life: The Luc. 23.42 43.
translation of blessed souls into heaven, in the moment of death: Finally the
Mat. 25.34
full redemption, and glorification of the Saints, in soul and body, in the
life to come.



Q. What things do we then crave of God, in this petition?

A. Six things, viz.

1 That Satan's Act. 26.18.
Kingdom may be abolished, the 2. Tim. 2.26. Coloss. 1.13.
bonds of spiritual captivity loosed, the Gal. 5.24.
power of corruption, that makes us like well of our bondage, abated, the 2 Thessalonians. 2.8
instruments of Satan's tyranny (as the Turk, and Pope, and all such outlawes
from Christ) defeated. 2. That the word of the Kingdom, the rod and (...).
110.2. (...) ^2. These. 3.1
standard of Christ's power, may have 2 Thessalonians. 3.1
free passage every where, and be gloriously lifted up and advanced. 3. That
the eyes of all men, especially Princes, may be opened to see the Reu. l. 17.^
1^.
filthiness of the whore of Babylon, and the true (...). ^0.5
beauty of the pure religion, and spouse of Christ. 4. That all Esa. 56.10.^^
loiterers, and tonguetied Ministers removed, M th 9.38.
faithful and able watchmen may be set over the flock of Christ, with
sufficient encouragement of maintenance, countenance, protection etc. 5. That
the Lord, by his word and spirit, would Col. 3.15, 1^.
rule in the hearts and lives of his Saints; making them also Kings, in part,
by ouercomming the corruption, which is in the world through lust. 6. That he
would finish the kingdom of grace, Genesis 9.27.
calling his elect uncalled, 2 Thessalonians. 2.17.
confirming such as stand, Iam. 5.15, 16.
raising the fallen, Esa. 61.3.
comforting the afflicted etc. and hasten the kingdom of glory, both by Phil.
1.23.
taking us in due time out of this conflicting life, into peace with Christ,
and finally sending his Son the Revel. 22.20.
second time for the full salvation of us, and all his chosen, that he having
reigned in us by grace, we may everlastingly 2. Tim. 2.12.
reign with him in glory.
SECT. XLII. Of the third Petition.
Q. What are the words of the third petition?

A. Mat. 6.10. Luc. 11.2.
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

Q. What is the meaning of these words?

A. First, by this word [thy] we exclude all wills opposed to, or diverse from,
the will of God: whether the will of 2. Tim. 2.26.
Satan, or our 1. Pet 4.2.
own, naturally corrupt, and enthralled to Satan; yea whatsoever 2. Sam 7.2,
etc. Iam. 4 15.
lawful intentions or desires, repugnant to the will of God.

Secondly, by the [wil] of God we here understand, not so much Deuteronomy. 29.29
that part, which he keeps secret from us, as his eternal counsel, the Pro.
27.1.
events of outward things, Act. 1.7.
times and seasons etc. which it is unlawful to enquire into, impossible to
know, or to withstand, and Act. 4 28.
no thank for us to accomplish, unto which we must only with patience and
contentment Act. 21.14.
submit our selves: as that part thereof, which is Deuteronomy. 29.29
reueiled, and made known unto us in the word, both in the promises, which we
are to believe, and in the precepts, which (as conditions of obedience, in way
of thanksgiving, annexed unto the promises) we are to perform.

Thirdly, by [doing] we understand, not a good intent only in the heart, or a
Mat. 21.30
profession of obedience in word and pretense: but an actual and through Jam.
1.25.
performance of what is required of us.

Fourthly, where we say, [in earth as in heauen] we propound to our selves the
patterns of the Psalm. 103.20, and 22
Angels and blessed souls, who being freed from all mixture of corruption,
do, in their kind, perfectly obey God; whom therefore we desire to imitate in
the manner, though we know we cannot equal them in measure, and degree of
obedience.

Q. What do we then ask of God in this Petition?

A. Three things. viz.

1. That all wills of wicked Zech. 3.2.
Angels and Psalm. 140.8.
men, as contrary to the will of God, may be disappointed. 2. That in us,
Psalm. 119.18
ignorance of the reueiled will of God, 1. Sam. 15.22, 23.
rebellion, disobedience, murmuring, etc. being removed, all pretenses and
dispensations, or powers, presuming to dispense with the will of God,
disclaimed, and our hearts by grace Psalm. 119.32.
set at large, strengthened, and Verse. 36.
directed, we may both know, and obey the will of our heavenly Father and
Lord. 3 That, for the manner of performance, we may, (after the heavenly
pattern aforementioned) Psalm 110.3.
willingly without constraint, or repugnancy, Psalm. 119 60.
speedilte without delay, Deuteronomy 5.28, 29.
sincerely without hypocrisy, Psalm. 119.6.
fully without reservation, and Verse. 112.
constantly without intermission, believe the promises of mercy, and obey the
precepts of holiness.
SECT. XLIII. Of the fourth Petition.
Q. THus far of the three first petitions for things concerning God: To come
to the three latter concerning our selves; What are we generally to note in
them?

A. The order and dependence they have 1. From the former three concerning God:
for we are then allowed, and Luc. 17.7. etc.
not til then, to seek good things for our selves, when we have first minded
and sought those things that concern the glory of God; because unto 1. Tim.
4.8.
godliness only the promises of this life, and that which is to come, are
entailed. 2. Between themselves; wherein is to be observed, First, that we
have but one petition for outward things, as less to be esteemed: but for
spiritual things two, as about Mat 6.33.
which, our care is to be doubled. Secondly, that yet the first place is given
to outward things; not as chiefest, but as Genesis 28.20.21.
helps to enable us to spiritual duties, and as steps Act. 17.27, 28.
whereby our weak faith may the better ascend to lay claim and hold on
spiritual graces. Thirdly, that, according to the order observed in the Creed,
(called the Apostles) we are taught to depend: On the providence of God the
Father, our Creator, for outward blessings: On the mercy of Christ, our
Savior, for the remission of our sins: On the powerful assistance of the
holy Spirit, our sanctifier, for the resisting and subduing of al temptations
unto evil.
Lastly, that in all these petitions, under one thing expressed, other things
are figuratively included, as shall appear.



Q. To proceed in order: What are the words of the fourth petition?

A. Mat 6.11. Luke 11.3.
Give us this day our daily bread.

Q. What is the meaning of these words?

A. First, by [bread] we must understand Pro. 27.27 and 31.14.
all outward things, serving for our necessity, and sober delight, as food,
physic, sleep, raiment, house, etc. together with the means thereof, as
peace, seasonable weather, and such like.

Secondly, by [daily] bread, or bread [insta^tly necessary] or [such as is to
be added to our substance] we understand such provision, and such a proportion
thereof, as may best Pro. 30.8
agree with our nature, charge, and calling.

Thirdly, by [our] bread, we understand 2. These. 3.12.
such, as comes to us by the blessing of God on our lawful labors, so that
neither God, nor man, can justly implead us for it.

Fourthly, when we say, [giue] we profess our selves Luke 17.10 Genesis 32.10.
unable, by any service or labor, to merit our bread (much less our
salvation) at the hands of God; but that, our right unto the creatures being
forfeited in Adam, we have nothing to plead, but only Gods deed of gift, made
unto us in Christ, the second Adam, and Heb. 1.2.
heir of all things; Romans 8.32
in whom and with whom all things are conveyed to us.

Fifthly, when we say give [vs] we profess our selves petitioners for all men,
especially the household of faith; that for the most part every one may have
sufficient, and, where want is, 2. Cor. 8.14.
others may be enabled to supply it out of their abundance.

Lastly, when we say [this day] or [for the day] we profess the Math. 6.34
moderation of our care, and desire of earthly things, with our purpose every
day by labor and prayer, to seek these blessings at the hands of God.

Q. What do we then beg of God in this Petition?

A. Two things: Viz.

First, bread: Iam. 4.3. Number. 11.4, 5, 6.
not quails, or delicates, not riches, and superfluity; but a proportion of
maintenance, credit, liberty etc. Pro. 30 8 1. Tim 6.8
convenient for us: and that with condition, Jam. 4.15 2 Samuel 7.27
if God shall see good, which is a caution proper to this Petition for outward
things,

Secondly, faith and grace, as well in Phil. 4.12
want, as in abundance, to depend on the providence of God for outward things:
to be Heb. 13.5
contented with, and thankful for, the portion which it shall please the Lord
to Psalm. 16.6
measure out unto us, as his gift; not envying such, to whom he gives more:
to Ephesians. 4.28
labor with our hands the thing that is goo^, that we may eat our own
bread: to add unto our labor 1. Tim. 4.4, 5
prayer, and thanksgiving, as whereby, on our part, all Gods blessings are
assured, and sanctified unto us: Finally to Phil. 4.6 Psalm. 37.5
contain our selves within the care for the means, leaving events unto Gods
only disposition.

SECT. XLIIII. Of the fifth Petition.
Q. What are the words of the fifth Petition?

A. Mat. 6.12 Luke 11.4
And forgive us our debts, as even we forgive our debtors: where, besides the
petition, is a reason added for confirmation thereof.

Q. What is the meaning of the words?

A. First, by [debts] we must understand sins (as Saint Luke expounds the
metaphor,) and that not in themselves, as breaches of the Law of God (for who
would say that we owe and are to pay sin unto God?) but with respect to the
punishment, and satisfaction, due to Gods justice for the offense of sins.
For our debt properly being Romans 8.12. and 13.8. Gal. 5.3
obedience, whereto we were bound under penalty of all the curses of the Law,
especially eternal death; we all in Adam forfeited that bond, whereby the Luc.
13.4. Mat. 18.24 etc. Romans 6.23
penalty became our debt, and is daily increased in us all by sinning.

Secondly, by [forgiuenesse] we understand such remission, as may agree with
Gods justice, which will not endure him to be a looser: wherefore it is
forgiveness of us, by taking payment of Job. 33.24.
another, even of our surety 1. Joh. 2.2.
Jesus Christ, in our behalf.

Thirdly, by saying [vs] and [ours] we Ps. 130 7 8. and 51.28
include with our selves, in this petition, as many as are in Christ, enabled,
by a true faith, to lay hold on him, and to plead his payment and satisfaction.

Fourthly, under one part of our Justification, to wit, the remission, or not
imputation of sins unto death, by means of the satisfaction of Christ's
sufferings, we do also conceive the other part, which is the imputation of
his holiness unto life eternal, as employed under the former, and inseparably
2. Cor. 5.21.
annexed thereto

Fifthly, when we say, [as we] or [ for we also forgive, etc.] we argue with the
Lord, not from merit, but Mat. 6.14, 15.
from the model of Gods grace in us; which, being incomparably inferior to
the mercy and love of God, and yet disposing us to forgive and let fall (in
regard of hatred or private Rom 12.19
revenge) any wrongs and injury of our brother against us, may both Neh 5.19
stir up the compassion of the Lord toward us his children, and Iam. 2.13
assure us of the attaining of this our request.

Q. What do we then ask of God in this Petition?

A. Five things: Viz.

First grace, feelingly to Psalm. 51.3
know, and frankely to confess, without excuse, or extenuation, the great debt
of our sins, and our utter Psa 130.3. and 143.2
inabilitie to satisfy for the same, or for the least part thereof.

Secondly the power of Luke 17.5
faith, to lay hold on the Esaias 53.5
meritorious sufferings, and obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto our full
justification.

Thirdly, the Romans 8.15, 16.
testimony of the spirit of Christ, exemplifying, and applying the general
pardon of sins, once for all granted to us at our conversion, unto the
several sins, and debts, of every day and moment of our life.

Fourthly we pray for remission of sin, not as intending, our selves, to
undergo the Ier: 14.7
punishment, or any part thereof, but contrariwise that the whole debt (which is
properly the punishment, as has been showed) may be accepted at the hands of
Christ our surety, and we fully discharged, and acquitted; so that Phil. 3.8, 9
nothing may remain on our account, but the righteousness of Christ, whereby
the favor and kingdom of God is purchased for us.

Lastly, that we may not be destitute of so important an Mar. 11.25 1. Joh. 3.14
argument, both to plead for mercy with God, and to assure our selves of
success (and so with the hypocrite, by mocking the Lord, bring a curse upon
our selves, in stead of a blessing) we desire of God a portion of that mercy,
which is so abundant in him, that we may be tenderly affected one toward
another, Ephe. 4.32 Col. 3.13
forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake forgiueth us.

SECT. XLV. Of the sixth Petition.
Q. What are the words of the sixth, and last Petition?

A. Mat. 6.13 Luc. 11.4.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

Q. What is the meaning of these words?

First by [temptations] are meant whatsoever things, by the corruption of our
nature, are unto us occasions of sin, as Pro. 30.9
prosperity, adversity, etc.

Secondly, when we say [lead us not] we acknowledge that God, though Jam. 1.13
he tempts no man unto evil, yet sometimes Mat. 4.1
leads men into temptations of probation; and that 1. By unusual probatorie
precepts, as Ge 22.1, etc
when he commanded Abraham to kill his son. 2. By sending an Deuteronomy. 8.16
extraordinary measure of prosperity, or adversity. 3. By letting loose
Satan (his bandog) to 2. Cor. 12 7
buffet and molest the godly, as Paul: or to 1 Kin. 22.22.
seduce the wicked, as Ahabs Prophets. 4. By desertion, leaving men to
themselves; whether Hos. 5.15
for a time, as 2. Chron. 32.31
Hezekiah in the business of the king of Babels Embassage: or utterly, as
those, whom he justly gives up to their own To. 1.26, 28.
lusts, and the Act. 5.3
power of Satan.


Thirdly by [deliuering] is meant a forcible Romans 7.24
rescuing of our nature, neither able, nor willing, to help it self out of
these dangers.

Fourthly by [euill] is meant, either the 1. Joh. 5.18, 19.
evil one, Satan, who pretends to have power over us: or the effect of
temptation, which, without the special grace of God, is extremely evil to
wit, 1. Tim. 6 9
sin, and damnation.

Lastly, under one part of Sanctification, that is, the avoiding and mortifying
of sin, is employed the 2. Cor. 7.1 Romans 6.11
other part also, which is ability unto new obedience.

Q. What do we then ask of God in this Petition?

A. That sin may Romans 6.1, 2
not only be pardoned unto us, but also mortified in us, and we raised up to
new obedience; whereto belong these six things Viz.

First, that seeing Job 1.10
we cannot be tempted without the will of God, nor 2. Cor. 12.9
resist without his power, if it be his blessed will, he would give us Pro.
30.8.
neither poverty nor riches, nor any such thing, as may endanger our spiritual
estate.

Secondly, that he would 2. Cor. 12.8
tie up Satan, and restrain his malice, and power, or else make us 2. Cor. 2.11
wise to know; and avoid his stratagemes: Ioh. 17.15.
preserve us from the evil that is in the world: and abate the power of To.
7.14, 25.
corruption, that is within us.

Thirdly, that in temptations (if he see good to prove us,) he would always
stand by us with his grace, to 1. Cor. 10.13 Iud. ver. 24
keep us from falling, and to give us an Esaias 27.9.
holy use of our trials.

Fourthly, that, leaving us at any time to our own weakness, for our
humiliation, he would graciously Psalm. 51.12
raise us up again, with increase of spiritual strength and courage.

Fifthly, that he would put an end to all trials, and to these days of
conflict, in his own good time, Romans 16.20
treading Satan, with his forces, for ever under our feet.

Lastly, that he would Heb. 13.21.
increase and perfect the work of his grace in us, enabling us to every good
work, and in stead of temptations to the contrary, affording us all helps
unto well-doing, as good examples, holy counsels, and encouragements, etc.

SECT. XLVI. Of the Conclusion of the Lords Prayer: and of the ordinary
circumstances, and kinds of Prayer.
Q. What is the Confirmation, and close of this Prayer?

A. Math. 6.13.
For thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever, Amen.
Which words, though not repeated by Saint Luke, yet are expressly mentioned by
Saint Matthew; and therefore causelessly, and without warrant, omitted by the
Church of Rome.

Q. What is the meaning of these words?

First, by [Kingdome] we here understand Gods 1. Chron. 29 11.
absolute sovereignty, and right over all things.

Secondly, by [power] we understand the Luc. 1.37.
omnipotency of God, whereby he is able to do whatsoever he will.

Thirdly, by [glorie] we do Psalm. 65.1, 2.
thankefully refer all good things to the honor and service of God that
gives them.

Fourthly, when we say [thine] and [for ever,] we exclude all creatures from
fellowship with God, in these attributes, because howsoever Kingdom, power, and
glory, are communicated unto some creatures (namely Dan. 2.37.
Princes) as Gods instruments, and Psalm. 82.6.
Vicegerents: yet God alone claims them Romans 13.1.
originally of himself, Pro 8.15. Job. 33.13.
absolutely without dependence, or control, ^. Iam. 1.17
eternally without beginning or end.

Lastly, by [Amen] we understand, Revel. 22.20, 21.
so be it, or so it is, or shall be.

Q. How is this a close of confirmation to our requests?

A. Because we do not only in general ascribe, Kingdom, power, and glory,
unto God, as his due, but also with respect unto our prayers, and suites;
believing and professing, that he, as King of heaven and earth, has Revel. 3.7
authority to dispose of all his treasures: as omnipotent, is Ephesians. 3.20.
able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think: Finally,
as the God of glory is interessed in the Psa 35.27.
welfare of his servants, for the maintaining of the honor of his name, and
Psalm. 119.49.
truth of his promises. Wherefore we also Ioh: 3.33.
set to our seal in the word of faith, Amen, not only testifying our earnest
desire that so it may be, but expressing our full assurance that so it shall
be, as we have prayed, according to the will of God, being already Math 7.7,
8.
let in by the key of faithful prayer into the rich Treasury of his mercies.

Q. This form being so absolute, what need we use any other words in praying?

A. Because, as to refuse this form sauoureth of a proud contempt of Christ's
ordinance, so to confine our selves to these words alone, argues extreme
idleness in this duty, wherein Hos. 14.3.
variety of words is required for the pouring out of our souls before the
Lord, and oftentimes, according to the occasion, some Mat. 26.41
one petition is more then the rest, to be insisted on and importuned.
Wherefore our blessed Savior has commended this for me unto us, as an
excellent, coppie or lesson, to be both repeated, and as we may, imitated, or
at the least, aimed at, by us his scholars; for which cause, both Ioh. 17.1,
etc.
he himself, and his Act. 4.24, etc.
Apostles, are recorded to have prayed in other words, which yet may be
referred to these. Finally the liberty, which the Lord affords us, is not to
be abridged, or despised, who admits al languages, words, and forms,
agreeable to this pattern, whether 2. Chron. 29.30. Psalm. 90. and 92 see the
titles. Number. 10.35, 36.
read, rehearsed by heart, or presently conceived; so be it, we 1. Cor. 14.15.
pray both with spirit and affection, and with understanding also.

Q. What gestures of body must we use in praying?

A. Such, as may best express, and increase, the reverence, humility,
feruencie, and affiance, that ought to be in our hearts: as the Ephesians. 3.14.
bowing of our knees, Lam. 1.41. Ioh. 17.1.
lifting up of our hands, and eyes to heaven etc: which yet are not Luc. 18.13.
always or absolutely necessary, so our Psalm. 143.8.
hearts be lifted up, and the knees of our Phil. 2.10.
consciences bowed before the Lord, and nothing done unbeseeming the company,
with whom we pray, and the kind of prayer.

Q. What kinds are there of Prayer?

A. They are two. Viz.

1. Public, in the Psalm. 84.1, etc.
assembly, or congregation, wherein our behavior must be 1. Cor. 14.40.
such, as may witness our communion, and desire of mutual edification. 2.
Private, that is, either with our 2. Sam, 6.20.
families, or private friends, or Math 6.6.
solitarily by our selves; wherein we have 1. King. 18.42.
more liberty of words, and gestures, then in company.
Q. Where must we pray?

A. Generally 1. Tim. 2.8.
all places are allowed, the Ioh. 4.21, etc.
ceremonial differences of place being removed, and Christ, our propitiatory,
every where Matthew. 18.20.
present before us: notwithstanding, according to the kinds aforementioned,
the public place of resort, for the worship of God, Esa. 56.7. Joel. 2.17.
best fitteth common prayers, and the private house, or Math. 6.6.
closet, is most convenient for private supplication: howsoever the Nehe. 2.4.
sudden lifting up of the heart in secret unto God, may be, as occasion is,
(without gesture) in whatsoever place, or company.

Q. When must we pray?

A. 1 Thessalonians. 5.17.
Continually, as the Apostle enioineth: for the whole course of a Christian is
a perpetual intercourse with the Lord: either suing for mercies, or Psalm. 5.3.
Luc. 2.37.
waiting for the answer of his suits, or rendering thanks for graces received:
nevertheless ordinarily the Psalm. 92. title
sabbath among the days of the week, and verse 2.
morning and evening, among the hours of the day, are to be preferred; whereto
such times must be added, wherein we Col. 3.17. Pro. 3.6.
enter into any business, or 1 Cor. 10.31 1. Tim. 4.4, 5
receive any of the creatures and blessings of God: extraordinarily Psalm.
55.17. and 119.62, 164.
other days, or hours, must also be set apart for prayer, especially in cases
requiring longer continuance therein, together with the 1. Cor. 7.5
extraordinary circumstance of fasting for the intension of our prayers.

SECT. XLVII. of Fasting, the extraordinary circumstance of prayer.
Q. TO add somewhat then concerning Fasting; What mean you thereby?

A. Not any natural abstinence, arising from sickness: nor medicinal, used
to prevent, or remove the same: nor civil, enioined sometimes by authority,
as in case of dearth, sometimes 2. Kings 6.25.
enforced by necessity as in siege, seafaring etc: nor yet moral, for 1. Cor.
9.27.
subduing of carnal concupiscence, and preservation of chastity, required
(especially in some constitutions,) by virtue of the 7. Commandment: but Joel.
1.14.
religious, that is, referred to religious ends, for the furtherance of the
special practice of repentance, and the enforcing of our prayers.

Q. What necessity is there of fasting?

A. Howsoever the Romans 14.17.
Kingdom of God consist not properly in the matter of meat and drink,
whether used or forborne; yet fasting, as an extraordinary help unto the
chief exercises of piety, has the warrant and weight of a duty, as well
from precepts, as examples, both out of the Leuit. 23.27, etc. Joel 1.12 Esa.
22.12.
old Testament, and the Mat. 9.14, 15 Act. 13.3.
new.

Q. When is this religious exercise of Fasting to be performed of Christians?

A. When God calls upon us for this duty by the Mat. 9.15
occasions, arising from his providence, and our own necessities.

Q. What are those occasions, whereby the Lord calls us to fasting?

A. They are generally two: Viz

1. Evils, which, being felt, or feared, we desire to remove, or to prevent; as
1. Sam 7.6. 1. Cor. 5.2
sins, and the Esther. 4 16 Jonah. 3.7. Math 17.21.
judgments of God for sin. 2. Good things, Act. 10.30
spiritual, or Nehem. 1.4
outward, which we desire to enjoy, and therefore do thus seek them, and
prepare our selves for the receiving of them.
Q. Whom does God call unto this exercise of fasting?

A. Zech. 12.12 etc.
All Christians, enabled by understanding, and grace, to judge, and perform
aright this weighty duty; unless any be exempted by present Math. 12.7 1. Sam.
14.29, 30.
debility: but differently according to the diverse occasions of fasting, and
kinds thereon depending.

Q. What are the kinds of fasting?

A. They are two. Viz.

1. Public, when the Joel 2.15.
gouerners and magistrates, stirred up by consideration of common Nehem. 9.1,
etc.
sins, Iona. 3.7; 8
calamities, necessities, or businesses of great importance, do, in the name
of God, blow the trumpet, and call a solemn assembly, or assemblies; in which
case he that obeys not, is Leuit. 23.29.
culpable before God and man. 2. Private, when upon the view either of Ezekiel. 9
4. Ier. 13.17.
public causes, not considered of by such as are in authority, or of the
like, but more private occasions (as domestical, or personal etc.) a
Christian is moved, either with his Zech. 12.12. 1. Cor. 7.5.
family, or special friends, or by himself Math. 6.17
solitarilie, to humble himself before the Lord. Wherein the more secrecy is
used, the greater proof is there of sincerity and hope of blessing.

Q. What are the parts of a true Christian fast?

A. They are two. Viz.

First, 1. Tim. 4.8.
bodily exercise, serving to the inward substance.

Secondly, an inward substance, sanctifying the bodily exercise, and making it
profitable unto the users.

Q. What is the bodily exercise in fasting?

A. It is the forbearing of things, otherwise lawful, and convenient, as labor
in our vocations, (in which respect such times are called Leuit. 23.32.
sabbaths) Esther 4.16
food, (from whence the whole action has his name of fasting) sleep, Joel
2.16. 1. Cor. 7.5.
use of the marriage bed, Dan 6.18.
music, mirth, perfumes, Exodus 33.4 etc.
choice apparel, or whatsoever ornaments of the body. All which, and the like
are to be forborne, in whole, or in part, for the time of humiliation (as from
Iud. 20.26. 2. Sam. 3.35.
morning till evening, or from Leuit. 23.32.
evening till evening again) so as nature be chastised, but not disabled for
service; and the delights of sense laid aside, but yet without annoyance and
uncomeliness.

Q. What is the spiritual substance of duty, whereto the bodily exercise
serves?

A. It is an extraordinary endeavor of Ezra. 8.21
humbling our souls before the Lord, and of seeking his face and favor:
consisting 1. In the Joel 2.13
abasing of our selves, by examination, confession and hearty bewailing of our
own, and the common Ezra 9.3, 4, etc. Nehem. 9.1, 2, etc. Dan 9.3, 4, 5, etc,
sins; setting before our eyes the glass of Gods holy law, with the bitter
curses, threatened to the breakers thereof, the examples of vengeance on the
wicked, the judgments now felt, or feared of us: but especially the spiritual
Zech. 12.10 etc.
contemplation of our blessed Savior, bleeding on the cross, with the wounds,
which our sins have forced upon him. 2. In Luc. 15.18, 21.
drawing near unto the Lord by faith, enabling us, not only fervently and
importunately to knock at the gate of his mercy for the Psalm. 51.1, 2 etc.
and verse. 14.
pardon of sin, remoouall of judgments, and grant of the graces, and
blessings we need: but also to make a Nehem. 9.38.
sure covenant with his Majesty, of Esa. 55.7. Jonah. 3.8.
renewing, and bettering our repentance thenceforward, in a more earnest and
effectual hatred of sin, and love of righteousness.


Q. What fruit or success may we look for, having thus sought the Lord?

A. Joel 2.14, 18. etc. Jonah. 3.9, 10.
Who knows, whether by this means we may stand in the gap, and cause the
Lord to repent of the evil intended, and to spare his people? At the least,
for our particular, we shall receive the Ezekiel. 9.4, 6.
mark, and mercy promised to such, as mourn for the abominations generally
committed; Mat. 6.18. Pro. 28.13. 1. Joh. 1.9.
together with plentiful evidence of our salvation, and assurance of the love
of God toward us; strength against temptations; patience, and comfort in
afflictions; with all other graces, plentifully vouchsafed (especially upon
such renewing of acquaintance) by Heb. 11.6.
him who is the rewarder of all that come unto him. So that we need not
doubt, but that as we have Psalm. 126.5.
sown in tears, so we shall reap in joy: and as we have sought the Lord
with fasting and mourning, so he will yet again be Ezekiel. 36.37.
sought, and found of us, with holy feasting and spiritual rejoicing.

A Psalm. 30.11, 12. and 50.15. Nehe. 8.10. Esther 9.22.
duty required, for the acknowledgement of such mercies, as we have by the
former course obtained: and so answering thereto, that from the one, with due
reference, the other may be conceived.

SECT. XLVIII. Of Alms.
Q. Having spoken of Prayer; and of Fasting, the extraordinary circumstance
thereof: let us proceed to Alms. What is Alms?

A. It is a duty of Christian love, whereby 1. Tim 6.17 18. Math. 5.42.
such as have this worlds good, do freely impart to such as are in want.

Q. How can it be both a duty, and withal free?

A. 1. That it is a duty appears by many formal Deuteronomy. 15.7, etc. Heb. 13.16.
precepts, touching this matter: in that it is called out Psalm. 112 9. Math.
6.1.
justice, or righteousness: in that every man is a 1. Pet. 4.10
steward of Gods blessings for the benefit of others: Finally in that according
to the performance, or neglect, even of this duty, men shall be Mat. 25.35 42.
judged at the last day. 2. It is free, not as being left by God unto our
choice, whether we will do it or no, but as proceeding from an heart, 2. Cor.
9.7.
freely and cherefully performing this obedience to God, and relief to our
brother without compulsion of humane law, etc.


Q. Who are to give Alms?

A. 1. Joh. 3.17
Whosoever has this worlds good, that is, such a portion, out of which, by
frugality, something may be spared, though it be but Luc. 21.2, 3.
two mites. And therefore not only 1 Timothy 6.17
rich men, and houshoulders are to give, but also such as Ephesians. 4.28.
labor with their hands, out of their earnings: servants out of their wages:
children out of their Parents allowance: wives, out of any portion they have in
several without their husbands, or allowance from their husbands, or out of
the common stock they enjoy with their husbands; provided the husbands consent
(in whom the possession fundamentally remains) be either expressed, or by
silence, or not gainsaying, employed: Finally even they that live upon liberal
Alms, must 2. Cor. 8.2, 14
spare something unto those, that have little or no supply.

Q. May there not be some cases, wherein such, as are accountable to others, may
give without their knowledge; yea against their will?

A. Yes; as appears in the wise and commendable 1. Sa. 25.3, etc.
example of Abigail; to wit, when the life and whole estate of the giver or
receiver, may be now or not at all, thus, or not otherwise, preserved. For Mat.
12.7
extreme necessity dispenses with the ordinary course of duty, both to
GOD, and man.

Q. Whereof must we give Alms?

A. Of that Neh. 8:10
good thing (that is, wholesome, and profitable to the receiver) which is
justly our own, not another man's; unless in case of extremity before
mentioned. For otherwise of goods evil gotten, or wrongfully detained, not
Alms, but Luk 19.8
restitution must be made.

Q. How much must we give?

A. We must 2. Cor. 9 6 Gal. 6.7 Pro. 11.25
sow liberally, that we may reap also liberally: notwithstanding, in the
quantity, and proportion of Alms, respect must be had.

1. To the Luc. 3.11 1. Cor. 16.2
ability of the giver; who is not bound so to give, as utterly to 2. Cor. 8.13
impouerish himself, and to make himself Act. 20.35
of a giver a receiver; (save that, in a common and extreme necessity of the
Church, 2. Cor. 8.1, 2, 9. Luke 12.33
every one must be content to abate of his revenues, that the rest may not
perish, and some whose hearts, God shall move, may Act 4.34, 35 with Act. 5.4
voluntarily, and commendably sell all, and put it into the common stock:) Yea
it is unlawful so to give unto some one good use, as to disable our selves for
the service of the Commonwealth, Church or Saints in general, or for the
relief of our 1. Tim. 5.8
Family or kindred in special. 2. To the condition of the receiver, that his 2.
Cor. 9.12 100 31.17, 18, etc. Iam. 2.15, ^6.
necessity may be supplied; not as to make him of a receiver, a giver: for
this is to give a patrimony, not an Alms; and belongs rather to justice,
binding men to provide for those of their own household, then to mercy.
Q. To whom must we give?

A. To Mat. 5.42 Romans 12.20
such as are in want: but with this difference; 1. In present extremity, we
must preserve life in whomsoever, Luke 10.33. with Ioh. 4.9
without enquiring who, or what an one the party be. 2. In cases admitting
Psalm. 41.1
deliberation, we must confine our Alms to such, whom Deuteronomy. 15.7, 11
God has made poor: as orphans, aged, sick, blind, lame, the Leu. 25.35.
trembling hand, etc. wherein such gifts are most commendable, as extend unto
perpetuity, as the erecting or endowing of Luke 7.5
Churches, 2. Kin. 6.1, etc. 2. Chron. 14.22.
Schools of good learning, Ioh. 52, 3.
Hospitals, etc. but as for such, as turn begging into an Art or occupation,
they are by order to be 2. These. 3.10, 11, 12.
compelled to work for their maintenance; which is the best, and greatest
Alms.


Q. What order must we observe in giving?

A. We must begin with such, as are nearest to us in regard of a 1. Tim. 5.8.
Mat. 15.5, 6.
domestical, Deuteronomy 15.7
civil, or Gal. 6.10
christian neighborhood (according to the laws of nature, nations, and
religion direct us) unless other circumstances, as the extremity of want, or
the 1. Kin. 17.13
dignity of the person to be relieved, do dispense: and so proceed to such as
are farther off, according as our ability can extend.

Q. What are the times, and places, fittest for this duty?

A. For public Alms, the fittest 1. Cor. 16.2
time is, when we meet together for the solemn worship of God; likewise the
fittest Luke 21.1
place, where provision is made for public collections: for private, Job
31.16 Pro. 3.28
when, and wheresoever, the necessity of our poor Brother offers it self
unto us.

Q. With what affection must we do Almsdeeds?

A. 1. Psalm. 112.4
With pity and compassion on our needy brother. 2. With humility, and Mat.
6.1, etc
secrecy, not seeking praise from men, but approving our selves unto God. 3.
Romans 12.8
With cheerfulness, because 2. Cor. 9.7
God loves a cheerful giver. 4. 2. Cor. 8.5
With simplicity, not respecting our selves, but the glory of God, and the
good of our fellow members.


Q. How many ways may Almesdeeds be performed?

A. Not only by giving, but also 1. By Deuteronomy. 15.8. Mat. 5.42.
lending to such, as are not able to Luke 6.34 Psalm. 37.26
lend to us again; (some being no less relieved by lending, then others by
gift) provided, we Exo. 22.25
take nothing for the loan, yea in some cases, either Neh. 5.11.
remit part of the loan, or commit it into the hands of our poor brother,
Luke 6.35
without assurance to receive from him the principal again. 2. By selling,
when we do not only Pro. 11.26
bring forth the commodity, (as of corn etc.) which others keep in; but also,
in a merciful commiseration of our poor brother, abate somewhat of the
extreme price. 3. By Neh. 5.18
forbearing whatsoever our right in case of great necessity.


Q. What fruit may we expect of this duty?

A. Not to 1. Chro. 29 14.
merit thereby at the hands of God; but yet 1. To make Pro. 19 17
God our Debtor, according to his gracious promise; who also in Christ will
Mat. 10 42. and 25.35 2. Tim. 1.18
acknowledge and requite it at the last day. 2. To Jam. 1.27
seal the truth of our religion. 3. To Heb. 6.9, 10 1. Joh. 3.14 1. Tim. 6.19
assure our salvation. 4. To Dan. 4.24 Luke 19.8
make amends to men, for former covetousness, and cruelty. 5. To Luke 11.41
sanctify our store, and bring a Deu. 25.10
blessing on our labors; yea and upon our Psalm. 112.2. and 37.26 2. Tim. 1.1^
posterity after us.


SECT. XLIX. Of the Providence of God concerning mankind after this life: and
first of particular Judgment at the hour of Death.
Q. THus far of Glorification begun, and of Redemption so far as it is
vouchsafed in this life: now let us come to entreat of perfect Redemption and
Glorification, and that under the providence or dealing of God with mankind
after this life. How does God then deal with men?

A. He brings them all to Judgment.

Q. What is here meant by Judgment?

A. The pronouncing, and executing of the irreuocable sentence of Absolution,
or Condemnation; which is done, Partly, on every man in Heb. 9.27
particular, at the hour of death, but Fully and Act. 17.51
generally upon all men, at the second coming of Christ.


Q. Must all men then dye?

A. Yea, Psalm. 49.10. Eccles. 2.16
all both good and bad; save that unto some, namely such as shall be found
alive, at the coming of Christ, a change shall be in stead of Death, as shall
be showed.

Q. Death being the punishment of sin, how comes it to pass that the
righteous dye, to whom all sins are forgiven?

A. Romans 5.12
Death indeed came on all mankind by reason of sin, but yet it is not in all
things the same to the godly and to the wicked: for howsoever unto both it be
the 1. Cor. 15.26. Psalm 90.3
enemy of nature, as the end of natural life: yet 1. Unto the godly it is a
token of Gods Ps. 37.37, 38
love: unto the wicked of his Job. 18.13, 14.
anger. 2. Unto the godly it is a Apoc. 14.13
rest from labor, and misery, (che 1 Cor. 15.16.
last enemy being now destroyed:) unto the wicked it is the Luke 12 20
height of all worldly evils. 3. Unto the godly it is the Rom 6.7
utter abolishing of sin, and perfection of mortification: unto the wicked it
is the conquest of sin, and accomplishment of their spiritual captivity. 4.
Unto the godly it is so far from being a separation from Christ, that even
the body severed from the soul, and rotting in the grave, is yet united unto
Christ, and the soul freed from the body is Luke 23 43 Phil. 1.23
with him in Paradise: unto the wicked it is an utter cutting off from the
favorable presence, and patience of God. 5. Unto the Luke 16.22
godly it is the beginning of heavenly glory: unto the Ver. 23
wicked it is the entrance into hellish and end less torments.


Q. How are men judged at the hour of death?

A. First, Heb. 9.27
in that God at that instant pronounces, and the conscience apprehends, the
sentence of blessing, or cursing.

Secondly, in that the soul of every man is immediately conveyed by the power
of God, and the ministry of Angels, into that state of happiness or miscrie,
Eccl. 11.3 Luke 16.26
wherein it shall remain till the resurrection, and from thence-forth both
soul and body for ever.

SECT. L. Of the General and final Judgment: and first of the preparation
thereto.
Q. TO come to the full and final Judgment, what are we to understand
thereby.

A. The great day of Assise for the whole world, wherein Eccl. 12.14
all men's lives, that ever have been, are, or shall be, being duly
examined, 2. Cor. 5.10
every one shall receive according to his works. In which Judgment we are to
consider three things: and first the preparation thereto.

Q. Wherein does the preparation unto the last Judgment consist?

A. In five things, whereof the

First is the foretokening of the time thereof; which though it be so Act 1.7
sealed up in the treasury of Gods counsel, that neither men, nor Angels, no
nor yet our Mat. 13.32
Savior himself, the Prophet of the Church, as man, in the days of his flesh
had express notice thereof, (that 1. These. 5.2, 3, 6
from the uncertainty, and suddenness of it, we might be taught to be
always in readiness for it) yet it has pleased God, and our Lord Jesus
Christ, to acquaint us with some Mat. 24.33
signs, whereby we may discern of his approach: Ver. 32
as men in spring time may descry Summer approaching, by the shooting forth of
the fig tree.

Q. What are the signs fore-tokening the last Judgment?

A. They are certain notable Mat. 24.6, etc.
changes, in the world, and Church, some farther off, some nearer unto the
coming of Christ: as The Mat. 24.14.
publishing and receiving of the Gospel throughout the world: The 1. Tim. 4.1
2. These. 2.3
Apostasy of the most part of professors, not loving the truth: The 1. Ioh.
2.18 2. These. 2 3, 4, 8, etc.
reueiling of Antichrist, the man of sin, and child of perdition; who under
the title of Christ's vicegerent, opposes himself unto Christ, in all his
offices, and ordinances, both in Church, and Commonwealth: Common 2. Tim. 3.1,
etc. Mat. 24.12, 37. 1. These. 5.3
corruption in manners, joined with security, as in the days of Noah, and
Lot: Wars and troubles, in the Mat. 24.6.
world, and Ver. 9.
Church: Mat. 24.24
False Christ's, attended with false Prophets, and armed with false miracles:
The Romans 11.25
calling of the Jews unto the faith of the Gospel. Finally Mat. 24.29 Luke
21.25
signs in heaven, earth, and all elements, as the trembling of the earth, the
roaring of the sea, the darkning of the Sun, and Moon, etc. yea, the 2. Pet.
3.7, 10, 12.
firing of the whole frame of heaven, and earth, with the Mat. 24.30
sign of the Son of Man, whereby his coming shall then be clearly
apprehended of all men.


Q. What is the second thing in the preparation unto the last Judgment?

A. The coming of Jesus Christ, the Act. 10.42.
Judge of the world; who in his Act. 1.11
humane, Reu. 1.7.
visible, body (but yet with unspeakable glory) shall suddenly Mat. 24.27.
break forth like lightening through the heavens, riding on the Reu. 1.7 Iud.
ver. 14
clouds, environed with 2. These. 1.8.
flaming fire, attended with all the Ver. 7. Mat. 25.31
host of the Elect Angels, and especially with the 2. These. 4.16
voice and shoute of an Archangell, and the trumpet of God, and so shall Mat
25.31 Reu. 20.21
sit down on the royal throne of Judgment.

Q. What is the third thing?

A. The summoning, and presenting of Mat. 25.32. Luke 17.37
all both dead and living men, together with Devils, before the glorious throne
of Christ the Judge.

Q. How shall all men both dead and living be summoned?

A. By the Ioh. 5 28
voice of Christ, uttered by the ministry of Mat. 24.31.
Angels, and namely by that shout, and 1. Cor. 15.52.
trumpet of the Arch-angell; whereto the Lord joining his divine power (as Joh
5.25
unto the word preached, for the work of the first resurrection) shall in a
moment both raise the dead, with their own bodies, and every part thereof,
though never so dispersed, and 1. Cor. 15.52.
change the living, so that it shall be with them as if they had been a long
time dead, and were now raised to life again.

Q. Shall there be no difference between the resurrection of the Elect, and
of the Reprobate?

A. Yes: For howsoever they shall Act 24.15. Joh. 5.28.
both rise by the same Almighty voice, and power of Christ, in the 2. Cor.
5.10. Reu 20.13
same bodies, wherein they lived upon earth, and those so altered in quality,
as that they shall be able to abide for ever in that estate, whereto they
shall be adjudged: yet 1. The Elect shall be raised, as 1. Cor. 15. Ver. 20,
22. and 45.
members of the body of Christ by virtue derived from his resurrection: the
reprobate, as malefactors, shall be brought forth of the prison of the grave, by
virtue of the Reu. 1.7
Iudiciarie power of Christ and of the curse of the Law. 2. The Elect shall come
forth to everlasting life, which is called the Joh. 5.29
resurrection of life; the reprobate to Dan. 12.2.
shame and perpetual contempt called the resurrection of condemnation. 3. The
bodies of the Elect shall be 1 Cor. 15.42, 4^, etc.
spiritual, that is, glorious, powerful, nimble, and impatible, like the body
of the first Adam in innocence; yea rather like the Ver. 49 Phil. 3.21.
body of Christ, the second Adam: but the bodies of the reprobate shall be full
of vncomelines, and horror (agreeable to the Reu. 1.7.
guiltiness, and terror of their consciences) and liable to extreme torment.


Q. How shall all men be presented before the throne of Christ?

A. The Elect, being gathered by the Angels, shall with Luke 21.28.
great joy, be 1. These. 4.17.
caught up into the air to meet the Lord.

The Reprobate, together with the the Devil, and his Angels, shall with Reu.
6.15, 16.
extreme horror and confusion, be drawn into his presence.

Q. What is the fourth thing?

A. The separation of the Elect from the Reprobate. For Mat. 25.33
Christ the great Shepherd, shall then place the Elect, as his sheep that
have heard his voice, and followed him, on his right hand, the reprobate, with
the Devils, as straying goats, on his left hand.

Q. What is the fifth and last thing?

A. The opening of the Reu. 20.12
book^s of record, by which the dead shall be judged. Viz.

1. The several books of all men's consciences, which then, by the glorious
illumination of Christ, the Mal. 4.2
Sun of righteousness, shining in his full strength, shall be so enlightened,
that men shall perfectly remember whatsoever good or evil they did in the time
of life; the Romans 2.16 1. Cor 4 5
secrets of all hearts being then reueiled. 2. The Exo. 32.32, 33. Ezekiel. 13.9
Reu. 3.5 and 21.27
book of life, that is, the eternal decree of GOD, to save his elect by
Christ, which decree shall then at length be Mat. 25.34
made known to all.
SECT. LI. Of the Act of the last Judgment.
Q. THus far of the preparation to Judgment; What are we to consider in the
second place?

A. The Act of Judgment, wherein the Elect shall Mat. ^5.34.
first be acquitted, that they may afterward, as Mat. 19.28
assistants, join with Christ, in the Judgment of the reprobate, both men,
and 1. Cor. 6.2, 3.
Angels.

Q. How shall the Act of Judgment be performed?

A. It has two parts: Viz.

1. Examination. 2. Pronouncing of sentence.
Q. How shall the examination be framed?

1. According to that Law of God, which has been revealed unto men: whether
it be the law of To. 2.12, etc
nature only, which is the remainder of the moral law, written in the hearts
of our first parents, and conveyed by the Joh. 1.9.
power of God unto all mankind^, to leave them without excuse; or that written
word of God, vouchsafed unto the Church in the scriptures, first of the old,
and after also of the new Testament, as the rule of faith, and life. 2. By the
evidence of every man's conscience, bringing all his works, whether good or
evil, to light, Romans 2.15
bearing witness with him or against him; together with the Mat. 12.27 and
ver. 41, 42. Heb. 11.7.
testimony of such, who either by doctrine, company, or example, have, in the
time of this life, approved, or condemned him.
Q. Shall there be no difference in the examination of the Elect, and of the
Repr bate?

A. Yes. For First the Elect shall not have their Ezekiel. 18 22
sins (for which Christ has satisfied) but only their Reu. 14.13
good works remembered. Secondly, being in Christ, they, and their works,
shall not undergo the Jam. 2.12
strict trial of the Law, simply in it self, but as the 2. Pet. 1.10, 11.
obedience thereof proves them to be true partakers of the grace of the
Gospel.


Q. Shall there be any such reasoning at the last Judgment, as seems to be
foretold in the 7. and 25. of Matthew?

A. No, but the consciences of men, being then 1. Cor. 4.5.
enlightened by Christ, shall clear all those doubts, and reject those
exceptions and excuses, which they seem now to apprehend.

Q. How shall the sentence be pronounced?

A. By the Judge himself, Mat. 25.
our Lord Jesus Christ; who according to the evidence and verdict of
conscience, touthing works, shall adiudge the Elect unto the blessing of the
Ver. 34.
kingdom of God his Father, and the reprobate, with the Devil, and his Angels
unto the Ver. 41
curse of everlasting fire.

Q. Shall men then be adjudged to salvation, or damnation, for their works
sake?

A. The case is different: for 1. Wicked men shall be condemned for the merit
of their works, because, being perfectly evil, they deserve the Romans 6.23.
wages of damnation. 2. The Elect shall be pronounced just, because their good
works, though imperfect, do Jam 2.18
approve their faith, whereby they lay hold on Christ, and his meritorious
righteousness, to be a true faith, as Gal. 5.6.
working by love, in all parts of obedience.


SECT. LII. Of the execution of the last Judgment: and the everlasting estate
of the Reprobate in torment, and the Elect in glory.
Q. HItherto of the Act of Judgment: What are we to consider in the third and
last place?

A. The Execution of Judgment: Christ by his Almighty power, and ministry of
his Angels, casting the devils, and reprobate men, into hell; and bringing Gods
elect into the possession of his glorious Kingdom; wherein the Mat. 25.46
reprobate shall first be dispatched, that the Psalm. 58, 10.
righteous may rejoice to see the vengeance, and, as it were, wash their feet
in the blood of the wicked.

Q. What shall be the estate of the reprobate in hell?

A. They shall remain for ever in unspeakable torment of body, and anguish of
mind, being 2 Thessalonians. 1.9
cast out from the favorable presence of God, and glorious fellowship of
Christ, and his Saints (whose happiness they shall Luke 16.23 and 13.28.
see and envy) into that horrible dungeon, figured in Scripture by 2. Pet. 2.17
Matthew. 8.12.
utter darkness, or blackenesse of darkness, weeping, and gnashing of
teeth, the Mark. 9.44
worm that never dies, the fire that never goes out, the Reu. 20.15.
lake of fire etc. Finally, where all things are, that can be abhorred, and
nothing that may be desired.

Q. What shall be the estate of the Elect in heaven?

A. They shall be 1. Cor. 2.9.
unspeakably, and everlastingly blessed and glorified in soul and body, being
freed from all passions, imperfections, infirmities, yea from such 1. Cor. 13.10
graces as suppose imperfection, as faith, hope, repentance, and the like; in a
word, from all the Reu 21.4.
first things: endued with perfect 1. Cor. 13.12
wisdom and holiness: possessed of all the Psalm. 16.11.
pleasures that are at the right hand of God: seated as Princes, in Reu^l. 3 21.
thrones of majesty, and crowned with 2. Tim. 4.8
crowns of glory: having Reu. 2.26
power over all creatures, and 2. Pet. 3.13
possession of that new heaven, and new earth, wherein dwells righteousness:
beholding, and being Psalm. 17.15.
filled with the fruition of the glorious ^. These. 4.17 Reu 21.3, 22, 23.
presence of God, and of the Lamb Jesus Christ, in the Heb. 12.22, 23, 24.
company of innumerable Angels, and of all the holy Saints that have been from
the beginning of the world, etc.

Q. Shall there not be inequality in the proportion of glory and of misery?

A. Yes: for though every one shall receive the full measure, whereof they are
capeable: yet,

First, the wicked shall Matt. 11.22, 24. Luk 12.47, 48. Reu. 18 7.
exceed one another in capacity of torment, according to the greater merit of
their sins:

Secondly, the Elect shall exceed one another, being made capeable of Dan 12.3.
greater glory, according to the proportion, not of merit, but of favor,
whereby in their different callings, they were Luke 12.4^, 43, 44. and 19, ^7,
19.
furnished with greater graces, and made more faithful in the employing of
them, whether in 2. Cor. 9.6.
doing, or in 2. Cor. 4.17 Reu. 7.14, 15
suffering for Christ his cause, in the time of this life.

DEVT. 32.29. Oh that men were wise! then they would understand this: they
would consider their latter end,

A Prayer for the Morning.
O Lord God, the Almighty maker, and careful preserver of all thy creatures,
but especially the savior and sanctifier of them that believe, by the merit
and efficacy of the blood of Jesus Christ: we acknowledge, that as all thy
works do praise thee, so it becomes thy Saints especially to bless thee,
and that both night and day, for the blessings of the night and of the day. May
it please thee therefore to receive at the hands of us, thine unworthy
servants, in the name of Jesus Christ, this morning sacrifice of thanks and
praise for all thy mercies, and namely those of the night past, and of this
morning. Thou, O Lord, have spread the darkness as thy curtain over us,
favoring us so much, as to hide the light of the world, and beauty of thy
creatures, that in the mean time we might commodiously take our rest. And in
the time of rest, thy providence, O Lord, has not rested in our behalf, but
waked for us whiles we slept, to keep us from the fears and danger of the
night. Yea thou have blessed the blessing of sleep unto us, and have thereby
restored the decayed powers of nature in us, whereas thou might justly have
cursed it, and turned it into sudden and unexpected death. Again, it has
pleased thee this morning to raise up the light of the day to shine unto our
bodies, laying open unto us the goodly shape of thy creatures, and inlightning
the ways wherein we are to walk: giving us ability of body, and alacrity of
spirit, to proceed in the courses of our several callings: finally, beginning
the world with us as it were, and putting us in possession of all thy works of
wonder. Further we remember with thankful hearts, all thy mercies formerly
bestowed and continued upon us: namely, life, health, peace, liberty,
maintenance, credit, fellowship, success in our affairs, preservation from
dangers, deliverance from troubles, recovery out of sicknesses, consolation in
afflictions, and the issue of them, even a morning of joy, after a night of
sorrow. Lastly, and above all, for magnifying thy mercy toward us, in the
great work of our redemption and salvation by Jesus Christ, and for every
link of the golden chain of grace, whereby thou have fastened us unto thy
self; namely, for election, vocation, justification, sanctification, and hope
of glorification: likewise for the means of grace, thy Christ, thy spirit, thy
word, thy sacraments, thy sabbaths, and the assemblies of thy Saints, with all
the helps of example, instruction, admonition, and fatherly correction; by
which thou have indeauoured to further us in the way of our salvation. Yea that
though our prouocations of thee be many and grievous, yet thy compassions fail
not, but are renewed every morning. For all these testimonies of thy bounty,
thy pity, thy patience toward us, what shall we render unto thee O Lord? We
do even take the cup of salvation, and call upon thy blessed name: we do
according to our poverty, offer thee the calves of our lips, confessing thy
goodness, and the due service of our bodies and souls, as a living and
reasonable sacrifice.

And now O Lord, we acknowledge our penury to be such, that we cannot live
but on thine allowance. For looking into our selves, we find no store but of
sin and misery: our understanding full of blindness, vanity, and
infidelity: our consciences dead and remorselesse: our hearts hard and
impenitent: our affections disorderly and violent: our appetites sensual and
brutish: our whole nature deformed with original corruption: our whole life
abounding with the fruits thereof in all manner of actual transgressions: no
ability to any good duty, no restraint or moderation in sinning against thee;
yea if we do any good thing, we are apt to blemish it with self-love and
hypocrisy: if we abstain from any evil, it is many times rather from the
act then from the love of it. In this case, O Lord, if thou should look
upon us as a Judge, straightly to mark iniquities, or take this our confession
as an evidence against us, how should we be able to stand before thee? But we
beseech thee take knowledge of it as of our complaint, and pity our poverty,
our misery, and our nakedness. Cloth us with the righteousness of Jesus
Christ, that may both hide our filthiness from thy sight, and, as the garment
of the elder brother, make us accepted before thee, and procure thy blessing.
Acquaint thy self with us O Lord, and renew daily with us the covenant of thy
peace: and even now this morning let thy spirit from heaven bring us a new
patent of mercy, that being to meet with thee in the ways and works of this
day, we may be sure to meet thee as a reconciled Father, not as an offended
Judge. Fill us with all joy and peace in believing: Comfort us over all our
sins, by the assurance of thy mercy: Confirm unto our hears our title unto
thy Kingdom. And because, o Lord, we live upon thine hand, and all our
welldoing is from thee, grant that we may yield thee so much due, that no
Lords besides thee may rule over us. And to that end, good Lord, do thou free
us from the contrary power and rule of Satan and of sin. It is not for thine
honor, O Lord, that thy servants should be under the yoke of thine enemies:
redeem us therefore mightily from the thraldom of the devil: help us to lead
our captivity captive: and stablish our hearts for ever by thy free spirit; For
where thy spirit is, there is freedom. Let that spirit of thine therefore, O
Lord, come upon us, and strengthen us with a greater might then that of Samson,
to break in sunder the strongest cords, even our special sins. Teach us to
see the vileness of them: power upon us the spirit of grace and godly sorrow
that we may mourn for them: affect us with an holy hatred and detestation of
them: waken us out of our security with the fear of thy judgments: strenghen
our weakness with the power of thy might: arm us with the furniture of thy
grace: encourage us with the presence of thy spirit, and be with us in our
spiritual conflict, as the King in the army: Cover our he^ds, assure our
hearts, instruct our hands, help us so to fight that we may overcome, so to
overcome that we may receive the crown of victory. Further, O Lord, we entreat
thee so to let thy kingdom prevail in us, that we may not only be thy
soldiers, but thy servants and subjects. To this end write thy laws in our
inward parts, give us understanding of thy will, set up the scepter of thy
kingdom in our consciences, subdue our hearts to the obedience of thy
commandments, win our affections to the love of thy statutes, conform our
lives to the rule of thy righteousness, and transform us daily into thine
image from glory to glory. Bless all the means of grace unto us, and bless
us with hearts sanctified, and set upon the means for increase of grace. Let
thy holy word, O Lord, be our chiefest treasure, thy statutes our counselors,
thy promises our comforters, thy sacraments our delicates, thy sabbaths our
best days, and thy servants our dearest companions. Let thy service be our
liberty, let thy yoke be our ease, and thy burden as wings unto us. Let thy
loving countenance be our sun, thy protection our shield, and thy favorable
acceptance our exceeding great reward. Grant that we may account this time of
thy Gospel as our harvest: and let us not now sleep, least we be the sons
of confusion; but let us so lay up in these days of plenty, that in the time
of dearth we may have something in store. Teach us so to number our days, and
so to spend them, that every day and every night we may be able to give up a
good account, especially in the night of death and morrow of judgment. And now
having begun to speak to thee our Lord, though we be but dust and ashes, we are
bold to continue our suit, even for bodily blessings. Bless us therefore we
pray thee, this day followin^, and all the days of our life, with that portion
of health, peace, prosperity, and every good thing, that may enable us, and
make us cheerful in duty. Advise us in all our thoughts and purposes, give
good success unto our lawful endeavors, strengthen us in our bodily labors,
sanctify us in our meats, and drinks, recreations, and companies. Grant that
in doing service to our selves and one ano her, we may still remember that we
are thy servants. Give us such spiritual eyesight, that we may see thee in thy
creatures, and in thy providence. Grant that nothing may draw us away from
thee, but that every thing may bring us nearer unto thee. Lord let us live in
thy sight. Let us not live without thee, as Gentiles, let us not be cast out of
thy presence, as Kain; let us not run against thee, as Balaam: but let us
walk with thee, as Enoch, Noah, and Abraham, taking knowledge of thee in all
our ways. And take thou knowledge of us, upholding us with thine hand,
watching over us with thine eye, guiding us with thy grace, setting thine heart
upon us to love us, and do us good and not evil all the days of our life.

Last of all we come unto thee O Lord, in the behalf of thy whole Church, and
of all our brethren and and sisters, thine elect servants, wheresoever they
be. Call the uncalled, perfect the called, raise up the fallen, strengthen the
weak, enlighten the ignorant, heal the sick, relieve the needy, and
distressed, release such as are in restraint, comfort them that mourn,
especially such as mourn for sin: strengthen the hand and heart of them,
that stand in the just defense of religion and right: quail and confound
every Adversary and Antichristian power and policy, and so publish and
propagate the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that thy name may be known, thy
kingdom enlarged, and the number of thy Saints fulfilled. Specially we
beseech thee, behold and visit this thy vine, which having rescued from the
Egyptian darkness, and slavery of Antichrist, thou have been pleased to plant
among us of this nation. Make us more thankful for our long peace, and for
the Gospel of peace. Bless thy servant James our sovereign, with our
gracious Queen Anne, Prince Charles, and the Count Palatine with the Lady
Elizabeth, adorn them with all Princely graces, answerable to their high
estate, but especially with such spiritual graces, as may make them Kings and
Priests to thee and thy son for ever. Impart of the same spirit of grace and
government to all the honorable of his Majesty's privy Counsel, to the
Nobility, and Magistracy of the Land. Bless thy servants the Ministers of
thy word and sacraments, and give them sufficiency, fidelity, and success in
thy business. Take knowledge of our private friends, our kinsfolks, our
charges, and whosoever may claim interest in this duty at our hands. Finally
to them, and us, and all that call on the name of Jesus Christ, both our Lord
and theirs, grant, whatsoever we have or ought to have asked, and that for the
only mediations sake of the same thy son our Savior Jesus Christ, to whom
with thee O Father, and the holy Ghost, one God, be praise and dominion for
ever and ever. Amen.

A Prayer for the Evening.
O Lord God, by whose gracious providence the night succeeds the day, and the
day the night: we acknowledge, that if we had no other glass to see thee in,
nor book wherein to read of thee, but that of thy creatures, we could not
without shameful unthankfulness be ignorant of thee; for as much as day
unto day utters thy goodness, and night unto night teaches knowledge. But
whereas thou art further pleased to reueile thy self unto us in the book of
thy Scriptures, and in the glass of thy Son Jesus Christ, if now we should
not know thee, or not acknowledge thee, how desperate were our blindness, how
damnable were our unthankfulness? wherefore we entreat thee to accept from
us, in the name of Christ, humble thanks for the manifold witnesses and
pledges of thy love toward us. Thou, O Lord, have made us, not we our selves:
yea thou have made us men and women, not beasts; perfect in shape, no^
monsters: sensible and of understanding, not fools. Thou did preserve us in
the womb, nourish us when we hanged upon the breasts, provide us means of
education, fit us for some honest employment, wherein now by thy goodness we
are exercised, and do therein find thine assistance and blessing. Thou have
brought us forth in a fruitful land, in times of peace and prosperity, so that
we have our share in the common blessings of a most happy government. Besides,
thou have in private compassed every one of us with particular mercies, tending
to the comfort of life. And even this day past have been our guide, our
Father, and our friend, and now bring us before thee with matter of praise,
and not of mourning; so that we may add the day past, unto the number of the
days of our wellbeing. And as if thou thoughtest all this too little for us,
thou have from all eternity set thine heart upon us, and appointed us to
salvation by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ: reueiled thy covenant of
grace unto us by thy Gospel confirmed to us: in particular the promises of
mercy, by the outward seals of thy sacraments, and by the inward seal of thy
spirit* changed our vile and cursed nature, and made us in some measure
partakers of thy divine nature: sealed us up by the Holy Ghost unto the day of
redemption. In a word it is thou O Lord, that have given us light: light of
nature, light of grace, and light of glory. For all which mercies, we do now
and always magnify thy glorious grace, beseeching thee to stir us up unto a
greater measure of thankfulness, and obedience; that as there is every day
in the book of thine account much goeing out toward us from thee, so thou
may find somewhat from us coming in unto thee. And now, O Lord, being
answered in our prayers of the Morning, and of the former time of our life, we
are emboldened to come again unto thee, who therefore do hear the prayer,
that to thee all flesh may come. We beseech thee therefore, be not weary of
our importunity, be not ashamed of our poverty: but as the sense thereof
leads us unto thee, so let the pity and commiseration of the same incline
thy merciful heart toward us. O Lord, we cannot come into thy sight, but we
bring with us great matter and occasion, either of wrath or of mercy from thee.
Our natural corruption, which, as the leprosy of Adam, cleaves to us all his
posterity, filling us even from our conception, with the seeds of all evil,
so that we brought with us a world of sin into this thy world. Our actual
transgressions, which in imitation of Adams sin, we have eueryone of us
committed: our thoughts, our words, our works, by which the eyes of thy glory,
have been daily provoked: Finally the heinous circumstances, whereby our
sins have been made out of measure sinful, as the abuse of thy patience,
quenching of thy spirit, despising of thy Gospel, unthankfulness for thy
mercies, unfaithfulness in thy covenant. These, O Lord, and many more; are the
mischiefs, with which our natures are blemished, our lives pestered, our
consciences burdened, and thy heavy wrath most justly procured. Yet because
thou have given thy Son Jesus Christ a means of propitiation, in whom thou
reconcilest the world to thy self, we have boldness through him to entreat
thee of grace and pardon. Lord, let his death and sufferings satisfy thy
justice for all our sins, and procure us favor and forgiveness from thee;
that so mercy may rejoice over judgment in our behalf, as both meet together
in thee. Let thy Christ, O Lord, be our Jesus, to save us from our sins, and
deliver us from the wrath to come. Enrich us with the treasure of his merits,
that may both ransom us out of the hand of our deadly enemy, and purchase us
an everlasting estate in the kingdom of thy glory. Let it not grieve thee, O
Lord, thus to make us more then gainers at thine hand; seeing at the hand of
him our surety thou art sure to be no looser. And whereas thou have not only
promised so to deal with us, but commanded us to believe that promise of
thine; O Lord, in desire to obey thy commandment, and to seal unto thy truth,
we profess that we do believe; yet privy to the weakness of our faith,
we pray thee help our unbelief. Speak peace, O Lord, unto our consciences,
replenish us with the comforts of thy spirit, multiply in us the evidences of
our salvation. Shed thy love abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, set us as
a seal upon thine hand, and set thy seal, O Lord, upon us; not only that
seal of Election, whereby thou know us to be thine own, but also the
seal of Sanctification, whereby we may know our selves to be thine. O Lord, if
we see nothing in our selves, but what we have of our selves, or of the world,
we cannot say we belong to any but to Satan; bearing no other, but his image
and superscription. But Lord do thou deface that cursed image, blot out that
superscription, dissolve in us the malicious work of the Devil. Let the old
man of corruption be dispossessed by the new man of grace, and the strong man
of sin, by the stronger man of thy spirit. Let no sin, O Lord, have
dominion over us* mortify in us the whole body of death, crucify and put to
shameful death our special corruptions, show us the ougly face of sin;
grant that we may see it as thou see it, and hate it with a perfect hatred,
even as thou abhorrest it. Yea let us see thee, O Christ, whom we have perced
with our sins, bleeding with the wounds thou have received from us, that we
may justly detest both our sins as the weapons, and our selves as the
traitors that have slain our Savior. On the contrary side, good Lord, renew
thine own image in us. Enlighten our dark minds with the knowledge of thy
truth, mollify our hard hearts with the oil of thy grace, revive our dead
consciences with the soul of new life, that living in the spirit, we may also
walk in the spirit. Plant in us faith without presumption, love without
d^ssimulation, fear without infidelity, zeal without hyprocri ie, knowledge
without pride, purity without iudgeing. Give us wisdom joined with
simplicity, courage accompanied with meekness, cheerfulness tempered with
sobriety, and let every grace in us be graced with humility. Fill us with all
the fruits of a lively and saving faith, working by love, let the fire thereof
flame in our hearts, and the light thereof shine in our lives, to the praise of
thy name, and the comfort of our consciences. And thus without ceasing, lead us
forward to perfection, guiding us by thy grace, and after bringing us to thy
glory. And now, O Lord, having in the first place sought thy kingdom and
righteousness, give us leave in the next place to seek thy favor in outward
things: Be with us this night, O Lord, to watch over us for good and not for
evil. Let it be our comfort that thou see us in the dark, and take
knowledge of us, when we are unmindful of our selves. But above all things,
keep us even in our sleep, from being unmindful of thee. Let our hearts
always be awake, and keep thy watch, O Lord, even as we would thou should
keep a watch over us, that whenever thou shall call for us by the general
alarm of judgment, or the particular summons of our death, whether at
midnight, or at the cock crowing, or at the dawning of the day, we may be
found ready to accompany our heavenly bridegroom. In the mean time sanctify
the blessing of sleep unto us, that the rest of the night may make us fit for
the labor of the day, and night and day being spent in thy service, may
prepare us for that day of thine, which shall never give place to night.

Lastly, seeing thou have vouchsafed this honor to thy servants on earth, to
make intercession unto thee one for another; we commend unto thy majesty the
care of thy whole Church, and of all our fellow members in the body of Christ.
Cause the^ all in thy due time to be brought forth, fashioned, and perfected,
according to the image of Christ our head. Let the Angel never cease flying
with the everlasting Gospel, to enlighten them that sit in darkness, to
preach good tidings to the poor, to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim
liberty unto the captives, till Babylon be quite ruined, and thy Jerusalem be
reared up and finished. To this end bless all Christian Princes and States: by
name thy servant James our Sovereign, with our gracious Queen and the royal
children, and as thou have crowned them with worldly honor upon earth, so
direct them unto that more glorious crown in heaven. Make them strong and
faithful, to maintain the crown and dignity of thy son, that under his
protection, they may happily reign and execute judgment. Assist with thy
counsel the Honorable privy Counselors: adorn the Nobles with spiritual
nobility: prosper the work of thy Gospel in the hands of thy servants the
Ministers: and the affairs of Justice in the hands of the Magistrates.

Vouchsafe to take special notice from us, of those whom thou have specially
recommended to us: and to them, and us, and all that desire to fear thy name,
grant all the blessings of mercy and peace in Jesus Christ our only blessed
Savior, to whom with thee, and thine eternal Spirit, O Father, be all honor,
obedience, and thanksgiving throughout all generations. Amen.

A private Prayer for the pardon of sin and for the favor of God.
O Lord God, mighty in power, excellent in Majesty, righteous in judgment,
rich in mercy: Thou art so far from despising and driving from thee, a weak
vile sinful wretch as I am, that thou call and drawest such unto thee. Unto
thee therefore (the God that hear the prayer) I am bold to approach in the
name of thy Son my Lord Jesus Christ, beseeching thee to hold out the golden
scepter of thy grace, and to admit me into thy presence. Let thy power not
dismay, but strengthen my weakness: Let thy glory not confound, but cover my
vileness; let thy purity not pursue, but purge my wickedness; let the riches
of thy mercy, not disdain, but take pity of my poverty and wretchedness.
O Lord I can plead nothing but misery in my self, to make way unto thy
mercy: from thee alone must all motives unto compassion be drawn. For till
thou did miraculously create me, I was without any being: and if in the
state of creation thou saw any thing in my nature, it was thine own, and
not mine. But (woe is me O Lord) that which I could not give unto my self, I
did by sinning against thee in Adam take from my self, and deface tha^ holy
image of thine, which was all the contentment thy spirit had in me, and all the
reioicing I could have in my self. And so have I imitated the pattern of that
first sin, in the days of my vanity, that thy spirit has found no matter
but of strife and contention with me. My whole nature has been an armorie of
weapons, and an army of soldiers, to fight against thee. And how that wicked
war has been waged, by malicious thoughts, words and works, provoking the
eyes of thy glory, my conscience in great part witnesses, and thou, O Lord,
that art greater then my conscience, can better tell. Yea since the time that
I was called by thy mighty word and powerful grace, to some beginnings of new
obedience, thy spirit has been put to continual strife within me. My corrupt
flesh, has still maintained a rebellious party against thee, and I my self
(which is the height of shameful treachery) taking part with it, have given
the repulse and foil unto thy good spirit. I ought to have served thee in
holiness, but I have caused thee to serve by my sins, and wearied thee with
mine iniquities. I ought to have been controuled and kept in order by thee,
but such has been my boldness in sinning, that I have checked thee, and put
to silence thy good grace, that rebuked sin in me. I ought to have lived as
under covenant with thee, but (wretch that I am) I have in many particulars
broken my vow, falsified my faith, and violated the everlasting covenant.
Finally what commandment of thine is there, O Lord, that I have not
transgressed? What grace, that I have not abused? what curse that I have not
deserved? Thou have graciously disposed me, and led me into some good
actions; but even in the best I have halted, and stumbled, through infidelity,
selfeloue, and manifold infirmities; so that if thou challenge that which is
thine own, nothing remains to mine account, even in my best services, but
the imperfection of them. Thus sinning perfectly, I have deserved thine
absolute curse; but by mine imperfect obedience I can claim no portion of
reward, no release of punishment at thine hand. And now, O Lord, if thou
straightly markest iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But there is mercy
with thee, that thou may be feared. O Lord, there is glory with thee, but
that is not to be approached: there is wisdom with thee, but that is not to
be comprehended: there is justice with thee, but that is not to be endured:
but there is mercy with thee, yea mercy reioicing over judgment, and for that
thou art for ever to be reverenced and adored. That link of mercy being laid
hold on, draws all the golden chain of thy glorious attributes, and
reconcileth thy fearful majesty unto poor sinners. That link of mercy, (O
Father of mercies) I am bold, in the name of Christ, and by the hand of faith
to lay hold upon: yet feeling the weakness and palsy of mine hand, I beseech
thee strengthen my unbelief. And what assurance I cannot have from my says
weakly embracing thee, let me have it from thy self embraced by me (yea
rather embracing me) who art mighty to save. Thou did enable thy servant
Jacob, to lay hold on thee, and not to lot thee go till thou had blessed
him. Lord give me the same strength, the same courage, the same success. Nay:
let me not let thee go for any blessing. For what blessing do I seek of
thee, but that thou abide with me by the presence of thy favor? For that
blessing teach me to wrestle with thee my God, with the wrestling of God. Thou
have promised thou will be found of them that seek thee not, and seek them
that go astray from thee: so have I found thee, or rather was found of thee,
when I was thine enemy, the servant of sin, the soldier of Satan. Thou
fou^dest me by thy word, revealing the way of Salvation unto me: thou foundest
me by thy spirit, winning my heart unto the obedience of faith: yea it pleased
thee to enter into covenant with thy servant, never to suffer that spirit and
word of thine to depart from me, but to establish thy fear in mine heart,
that I should not depart from thee. Give me leave to put thee in remembrance of
that promise of thine, wherein thou have caused me to put my trust, and by
virtue thereof, to claim the continuance of thy favor and love. Oh let it
never be said, that thou forsakest the works of thine own hands, or that thou
repentest of showing mercy, whose glory it is to repent only of the evil.
Show thy self to be Jehovah that changest not, that thy gifts and callings
are without repentance, and that thou love with an everlasting and victorious
love, that overcomes all impediments. Truth it is, O Lord, that I deserve
thou should be weary of me, and from henceforth pursue me with thine
hatred, seeing I have walked so unworthy of thy love. But though my sins do
testify against me, yet deal thou with me according to thy Name. Let thine
own gracious and constant nature move thee. Let thine own promise, and the
word of thy Covenant bind thee. Let the beginnings of thine own workmanship,
and lineaments of thine image prevail with thee, to continue thy mercy and
truth toward me unto the end. Let it suffice that I know mine iniquities, and
do not thou take knowledge of them. Let it suffice that I set them in order
before my self by serious examination, and before thy Majesty by unfeigned and
hearty confession: and do not thou enter into that heavy Judgment with me,
as to set them in order before me to reprove me for them. Let it suffice that
I now look up, by thy spirit of grace, upon my Savior whom I have pierced with
my sins; and do not O Lord, do not gather my soul among those that shall
at the last day behold him to their confusion, and wail before him for ever.
Yea, Lord, therefore thou show me my sins, that thou might show me
thy mercy in the pardon of them; therefore thou teach me to reprove my
self, that I might believe in thee who iustifiest the ungodly: therefore thou
causest the wound of my conscience to bleed and smart, that I might look to
thee in Christ, in whom thou healest the broken hearted, and bindest up all
their sores. Thou, O Christ, art anointed of God the Father, to be the author
of this sovereign cure. Thou art the Sun of righteousness, that sheddest the
beams of health and salvation into the hearts of thy people. Thou have taken
my flesh upon thee, that, being the kinsman, thou might be fit to recover
my patrimony lost in Adam, and to raise up living seed unto my dead nature. O
spread the skirt of thy garment over me, and shrowde my soul from the wrath of
GOD my judge. Let the sweet perfume of thine invaluable sacrifice take away the
odious savor of mine iniquities. Let the cry of thy precious blood, speaking
good things in the ears of God the Father, drown the loud cry of my grievous
transgressions. Let thy glorious face and countenance, appearing before God for
me, turn away his eyes from my sinful deformities. Let thy death be my
ransom and propitiation, to deliver me from the wrath to come: and thine
obedience the price, to purchase for me the kingdom of glory. Thine it is, O
Savior, by a double right. The one of nature, as thou are the everlasting
Son, coequall with the Father, by which thou claimest for thy self the
glory thou had from the beginning. The other of purchase, by thy
voluntary submission, and obedience to that Law, of which thou were the Lord
and maker, which it pleases thee by the Covenant of grace to dispense to all
believing and repentant sinners. Herein, herein, O Christ, grant that with all
Saints I may have my share: and may enjoy that, which thou in my behalf have
so fully paid for. Let the assurance of this thy mercy give rest unto my
conscience, from the terrors of death and hell. Let the expectation of this thy
glory sustain my soul, whiles I flutter about like the Dove of Noah, finding
no rest in this world, ouer-flowed with wickedness; till it shall please thee
to stretch forth thine hand out of the Arc of heaven, and take me to thy
glorious rest. Finally, O my Lord, being come unto thy kingdom; remember me
thy servant with the favor of thy people, and visit me with thy salvation.
Let me see the felicity of thy chosen, and rejoice with the joy of thy people,
and glory with thine inheritance. Let me in this life behold thy face in
righteousness, and when I shall awake, in the resurrection of the just, let me
be satisfied with thine image. To thee, O Christ, with the Father, and the
Holy Ghost, one God and King everlasting, be all glory, dominion, mercy, and
salvation ascribed for ever. Amen.

A private Prayer for the grace of Sanctification.
O Lord God, Father of lights, author and giver of every perfect gift, the holy
one of Israel, and the sanctifier thereof, before whom the Seraphims hide their
faces, and in whose sight the heavens are not pure: When I compare my
filthiness and pollution with thine absolute purity, I cannot without fear
and astonishment, without shame and confusion approach into thy presence, that
am a vile sinner, of polluted lips, and of uncircumcised heart. But when I
consider thy great mercy and goodness that do open unto sinners not only a
way into thy favorable presence, by the veil of the flesh of Jesus Christ,
but also thy gracious hand to bestow the gift of holiness upon all those, that
finding lack of it in themselves do seek it of thee: I am encouraged to come
before thee, compassed, as I am with miseries and infirmities, that I may
return from thee, compassed and clothed with thy glorious graces. O Lord, if
I let thee see my sins and defilements, thou may proceed in judgment
against me for them: if I hide them from thee, how can I look to be cured and
cleansed of them? Nay I cannot hide them from thee, O Lord; but laboring to
conceal them, I shall make them more apparent. Only show me this favor, not
to behold them as a Judge to be avenged of them, but as the only sovereign
Physician of my soul, to cure and heal them. And so good Lord, let me not
spare to open unto thee, the sickness and sores of my corrupt heart, and life.
Yea rather do thou, O Lord, for the beginning of thy gracious work, show me
in the glass of thy word my pollution by sin, that I may seek after the
lauer of thy grace, to be washed and made clean. Light up, O Lord, in my
heart the lamp of thy word and grace, that of thee, who only searchest the
heart, I may learn to search and know my wicked heart, and by the light of thy
word I may be able to work under ground, unto the bottom of the mine of sin,
that lurketh in my nature. Let me count all my sins as Traitors unto thy
glory, and my safety: and search the house of my heart for them; but
especially for my special sin, as for the chiefest Rebel. Yea grant me so to
search my self, that I may avoid and prevent thy dreadful search: so to judge
my self, that I may avoid thy judgment: so to co^demn my self, that I may
avoid thy sentence: so to hate and abhor my self, that I may avoid thy
wrath: so to be aue^ged of my self that I may avoid thy punishment. Let sin,
O Lord, be as bitter to me in the attempting, as in the repenting: at least
wise more bitter in the repenting, then ever it was sweet in the committing;
that either heedfull prevention may keep me from bitter repentance, or the
bitter reares of repentance may exempt me from that most bitter account in the
day of thy judgment. Teach me to bring into discredit with mine heart all
iniquity, and all appearances thereof. Grant me strength to overcome my
sinful lusts, at least let me always strive against them, that I may be
assured I am a member of thy Church militant. And whenever I cease to strive,
let me not boast of victory, or rejoice of ease, but be ashamed of my foil,
and flight. Grant that unto faith in thee I may always join fear, not only
of Satan with whom I am in conflict, but also of the frailty and treachery of
mine own heart, and of the slipperie paths of this sinful world. Bring down,
by the battery of thy spirit, the hills of my high and proud thoughts,
streighten my crooked and distorted affections, make plain and smooth the
rough ways of my rebellious and stony heart, that thou may walk at ease in
the mids of me, and that I may see thy salvation, O God. Let me look on the
pleasures and profits of this life, not only as thy liberal allowances to me,
but also as Satan's baits to inueigle me, that moderately using them, I may be
thankful to thee for them, and avoiding the excess and abuse of them, I may
be free from the snares of the Devil. Yea do thou so weane me from the love
of the world, and the things thereof, that Satan may be to seek of baits to
allure me to sin. Let me account my self a stranger on earth, and therefore
abstain from fleshly lusts that fight against the soul. Let me not value the
pleasures of sin at so high a rate, as for them to make shipwreck of a good
conscience before thee, or of a good report among men. Let me by light
esteeming of outward things, show that I take no thought for the flesh, to
fulfill the lusts thereof, and by the denial of my self approve, that I live
by faith, putting on the Lord Jesus Christ. Teach me, not to set my heart on
uncertain riches, which the more I desire to have, and love when I have them,
the more they will vex me when I am to part with them: but let me use them as
things that must shortly leave me, or I them; and thy word only as that which
shall abide with me for ever. Teach me, with Jacob, to account my self less
then the least of thy mercies, that by humility I may be fitted for greater
graces. In all things give me grace to take heed of offending thy Majesty,
and as I would not thou should break the bruised reed, or quench the
smoking flax in me, so grant that I may not dare to quench the spark of thy
spirit and grace in my heart. As I would thou should give me rest from the
terrors of thy wrath, so grant that I may give thy spirit rest from the
prouocations of my sins. On the other side (good Lord) grant me that
knowledge of religion, that may beget conscience: that conscience that may
preserve religion; binding me, not by guilt to the punishment of sin, but by
grace to the obedience of righteousness: setting me at liberty, not from the
band of dutiful love, but from the yoke of servile fear. Enlighten mine eyes
that I may discern of thy will, and guide my feet in thy ways, that I fall
not by the deceiueablenesse of sin, and so become a slander to thy Gospel.
Little is the good that is in me, O Lord, and that not of my self, it is thy
gift: yet grant that it may be sound and sincere; not as the morning dew, that
wastes at the first heat, bu^ as the morning light, that shines more and
more unto the perfect day. Let me measure my self, not by that others judge
me, or I feel my self to be; but by that I desire and labor to be: that I
may neither justify my self, loving sin, though I commit it not; nor
condemn my self, longing after grace, though I cannot find that I have
attained to it. Let my reioicing be, not that I have deluded the world with a
fained show of holiness and integrity, but that in simplicity and godly
pureness I have had my conversation among men, as in thy sight. Renew my
youth, O LORD, as the Eagle, not to the service of sin, but of thy name. Let
it be my meat and drink to do thy will, and let my hunger after it be so
great, that it may break through all the stone walls of impediments and
discouragements thereto. Yea the more I am discouraged, and withdrawn from
duty, by the practices of Satan, and the weakness of my flesh, the more let
me strive thereto, and abound therein, that Satan finding himself a looser,
may be forced to give over his assaults. Let me be so far from weariness
in thy service in the time of prosperity, as I would thou should be from
neglecting me in the hour of necessity. Let thy love toward me, O Father,
win me to the love of thee, and let my love to thee constrain me, even
with denial of my self, to serve thee. Teach me to look for all good things
from thee, by the means of JESUS CHRIST, and in him to offer up my daily
sacrifices unto thee. Disperse in me the clouds of sin, that my heart as in
a clear day, may always behold thee. Let all worldly joys be swallowed up
in me, with the joy of thy holy Spirit: and before all peace, let me prefer
the peace of a good conscience: Let me rejoice in thee without lightness, and
mourn for mine own, and others sins, without discouragement. Power upon
me thy Spirit of grace and supplication, that I may call upon thee with sighs
that cannot be expressed, that cannot be denied: that with this key I may
open the treasury of thy goodness, and enrich my self. Make me a meet
guest to sit down at the marriage feast of the Lamb, and grant that I may
be careful not to be found without the wedding garment of faith working by
love. Let me keep a diligent account of what I receive from thee, and
remembering that there shall be a day of reckoning, grant me so to govern my
self in the employing of thy talents, that both thou may receive of me thine
own with advantage, and I, being found faithful in little, may be made
ruler over much. Let me account this term of life, a seed time, and let me
not doubt to cast my bread upon the waters, seeing at the end of days I shall
find it again. Let me not esteem my self the poorer for bestowing upon thy
needy servants, but let me think that as the corn which is sown, remains
not in the ground, but returns with increase to the sower, so what I give in
thy name shall not remain with the receiver, but return unto me with
advantage. Make me willing to bestow, and to be bestowed, for the good of thy
Saints: and withal humble, to ascribe both the gift, and the willingness to
give, to thy grace only. Grant, good Lord, that being a pilgrim upon earth,
I may have my conversation in heaven: and professing my self to be a citizen
of that Jerusalem, which is from above, I may desire not only to enjoy the
privileges, but also to speak the language, and to be governed by the laws
of that City. Make me wise, O Lord, to understand and consider my latter end.
Let my whole life be a preparation to death, and the meditation of death, the
rule of my life. O Lord, guide my heart to the love of thy Majesty, and the
waiting for of thy Son. Unto mine old age, and gray head, O God forsake me
me not: and let thy fear keep me from forsaking thee. Let me be among
those, that are planted in thine house, and flourish in thy Courts. Let me
bring forth more fruit in mine age. Let my later days be my best days, and
my works more at the last, then at the first. Finally, enable me in this
pilgrimage of my life, so to walk from strength to strength, that at the
length I may appear before thee, with the Congregation of the first borne, in
that kingdom of glory, which thou have prepared for all that love the
appearance of thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ. To whom, with thee, O Father,
and thy Spirit, be all honor and obedience, in the Church, hence forth, and
for ever. Amen.

A short Prayer for the Morning.
O Eternal and Almighty Lord God, who in unspeakable wisdom and goodness
have made all things for the good of man, and man with all, and above all
things, for thine own glory; we humbly acknowledge our selves to be utterly
unworthy of the least of all thy mercies, which we either enjoy, or desire to
enjoy. For (O Lord) we are not only weak creatures, unable to give unto thee
first, that we should be recompensed: but also sinful and unthankful
wretches, not rendering unto thy Majesty, according to thy kind and gracious
dealing with us. Thou createdst us, O Lord, in thine own image, endued with
wisdom and true holiness, adorned with all bodily perfections, advanced unto
dominion over all thy works of wonder: but we all in Adam, by breaking thy
Covenant, forfeited our birthright, de^aced thine holy image, and made our
selves more vile then the beasts that perish. Thus were we borne into the
world an increase of sinful men; full of ignorance and vanity of mind, of
rebellion and obstinacy of heart, secure in conscience, perverse in
affections, unbridled in appetite, utter enemies unto thine holiness;
careless to know or seek after thee, unwilling either from thy blessings, or
from thy judgments, to take knowledge of thee. Yea, Lord, when thou causedst
the light of thy glorious Gospel to shine unto us, our foolish hearts despised
that light, and preferred darkness before it, because our deeds were evil;
so that if thou had not given us, as well sight as light, and a mind, as
well as means, to know thee who art true; even to this day our eyes had been
still blinded by Satan, the God and Prince of the darkness of this world. But
blessed for over be thy glorious Name, who for thine own mercies sake, not our
merit, and by thine own Almighty power, without any disposition or
concurrence on our part, have effectually called us unto the knowledge and
obedience of thy Gospel. But what can we plead for our selves, O Lord, that
have walked unworthy of this thy great grace, and as much as in us lies,
again defaced thine image in us, even the new creature? For since the time
that we gave our names unto Christ, and professed our selves to be of his
party, we have many ways, and many times, treacherously joined with Satan,
with the world, and our own corruption, to sin against the honor of our
Savior, and against the light of knowledge, which shines into our
consciences; so that by our disobedience and rebellion we have weakened the
cause of thy Truth, and opened the mouth of the Adversary to reproach the holy
Gospel of thy Son Jesus Christ, which we profess. Finally, our whole course
and conversation abounds with continual breaches of all thy righteous laws,
and is shamefully barren of those fruits of righteousness, which by Jesus
Christ should redound unto thy praise and glory. Wherefore, O Lord, we freely
confess against our selves our great wickedness: we judge our selves worthy
^o be destroyed for all our iniquities: we abhorne our selves and repent before
thee in dust and ashes: we fly only to thy rich mercy and grace in Christ
Jesus; beseeching thee for his sake to have mercy on us, with his blood to
wash and cleanse us from all our sins, in his face and countenance to behold
us, in his absolute merit and mediation favorably to accept us. So shall
there be no condemnation for us, being in Christ Jesus, who was made sin for
us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

Further, O Lord, that we may soundly assure our selves that we are in
Christ, and withal be enabled to walk more worthy of thy grace, we beseech
thee make us more and more partakers of the spiritual power, both of the
death, and life of Christ. Let the power of his death mortify in us all
carnal and sinful lusts: let it crucify the world unto us, and us unto the
world: let it dull and dead our hearts unto the allurements of sin: let it
make us senseless, or careless, of the discouragements that are, or may be,
offered in the way of welldoing. Let it arm us with this mind, rather to
suffer any trouble; and forbear any pleasure, then, by sinning against thee,
to hazard the peace of a good conscience. On the other side, let the quickening
power of the life of Christ revive our dead nature unto new obedience: let it
in flame our hearts with the love of thy majesty: let it make thy word
sauourie unto us, and more desirable then our appointed food: let it teach us
resolutely to shake of all impediments, carefully to redeem all occasions,
and gladly to embrace all opportunities of doing good. Finally unto all these
good purposes, work in us, by thy holy word, and spirit, a daily increase of
living and saving faith. O Lord, it is thine only unspeakable gift; without
whom it is no more possible to believe that which thou promisest, then to
perform whatsoever thy law requires. Thou therefore, O Father, for Christ
Jesus sake, by the powerful operation of thy Spirit, work and increase in us
this mother grace. Teach us so to lay hold on Christ, and lodge him in our
hearts, that we may not only apply, and assure unto our selves, all the
promises of life and mercy, but also cleanse our selves from all filthiness
of the flesh and spirit, and grow up unto full holiness in the fear of thy
Majesty.

And now, Lord, for outward things we submit our selves to thy wise and
fatherly providence; only beseeching thee, to give us this day, what thou
know needful and behoofefull unto us for the day. Lord feed us with food
convenient for us: give us such a portion of health, maintenance, credit, and
all outward comforts, as may make us thankful and serviceable unto thee. And
above all, give us grace to employ and improve all thy blessings, as thy
talents, to the furtherance of the work thou have given us to do. Lord give
us every day (but especially on thy Sabbath days) more then a natural and
common use of thy good creatures. Let us in all things taste and see, how sweet
and gracious a God thou art, Let thy good blessings be, not as a wall, to stop
our sight, that we may not look beyond them; but as a glass, through which
we may the better discern thy love and faithfulness toward us concerning
heavenly things. Let us serve thee with an upright heart, in the duties and
businesses of this day; bringing the general profession of religion into
particular practice, according to our several callings. Lord let us never be
a burden unto humane society, nor a blemish unto the profession of
Christianity, by idleness, or inordinate living. Make our labors and
endeauours fruitful and beneficial, not only unto our selves, that we may
eat thereof, and rejoice before thee, but also unto all others whom they
concern, that they may praise thee with us, and for us.

Bless thy whole Church, O Lord, and build it up more and more in perfect
beauty. Take pity on those thine elect, that walk yet in darkness, and
cause the light of thy Gospel of grace to shine unto them. Confirm thy
gracious work in those, who have received the first fruits of thy spirit.
Comfort such as mourn for sin. Fulfill the desires of all that truly long
and sigh after thee. Support, and cure the infirmities of all that are humbled
under thine hand, and that have seen affliction in the rod of thy visitation.
Preserve the good land wherein woe live: make us more thankful for all thy
rich blessings, and our manifold mighty deliverances. Save thine Anointed
servant, our Sovereign Lord King James; with our gracious Queen Anne, and the
Royal progeny. Assist with thy spirit and grace, all that are in authority;
sanctify all those whom thou emploiest in the work of the ministry.
Remember in special mercy, those, whom thou have knit unto us in the bands of
consanguinitie, affinity, neighborhood, or Christian amity. Finally, unto
all thine, and ours, vouchsafe Peace and mercy, through Jesus Christ, thy dear
Son, our alone Redeemer and Savior. To whom with thee, O Father, and thy
holy Spirit, one God, and King everlasting, be rendered all honor, service, and
thanksgiving, for evermore. Amen.

A short Prayer for the Evening.
O Almighty God, King of Glory Father of Eternity, who dwelling on high
abasest thy self to behold things in heaven and in earth, and being the first
and the last, give beginning and ending to all times and affairs, wherein
thy creatures are employed; we acknowledge with humble and tha^kfull hearts, the
riches of thy bounty afforded us, thine unworthy servants, as well this day
now past, as in the whole course of our lives. Thou O Lord, have made us, and
that fearfully and wonderfully: thou have been our hope from our mothers
breasts. Thou have lengthened the days of our life unto this hour, and therein
have showed us many mercies. Thou have freed our bodies from diseases and
dangers, our names from reproach, our substance from spoil, our liberty from
violent and unjust restraint. Thou have strengthened us unto labor, satisfied
us with thy good creatures, cheared our hearts with the fellowship and love of
thy people, our fellow servants: and blessed our endeavors with success
through thy good providence. Thou have heard our prayers, accomplished our
desires, turned away our fears, mitigated our troubles, and put an end from
time to time to all our afflictions. Thus have thou showed thy self to be the
God, that delightest in the prosperity of thy servants. But, O Lord, how can
we worthily magnify thy mercy toward us in Jesus Christ? In whom thou have,
from all eternity, appointed an heavenly Kingdom unto us: By whose word thou
have called us: by whose blood thou have redeemed us: by whose Spirit thou have
sanctified, and sealed us unto the day of redemption: In whom we have this
liberty, to call thee Abba, Father: In whom, and with whom, all earthly
blessings are given unto us, not only for our bodily comfort, but also as
pledges of our heavenly inheritance. Oh, how dear therefore are thy thoughts
of mercy unto us, O Lord how great is the sum of them Blessed Father,
enlarge our hearts to comprehend thy love, and incline them to love thee, who
have so loved us.

But let us mourn and be ashamed that we have returned nothing unto thy
majesty, but hatred for thy good will. Let it strike our hearts, that we have
abused thy bodily blessings unto covetousness, or intemperance: thy patience
unto presumption: the grace of thy Gospel unto licenciousnesse in sinning. Let
us abhor our selves, that we have profaned thy sabbaths, despised thy word,
quenched thy spirit, unhallowed thy name, and many ways defiled the holy
profession we have taken upon us. Let us repent in dust and ashes, for our
wilful blindness of mind, hardness of heart, remorselessenesse of
conscience; whereby we have resisted the work of thy grace in us. Thou O Lord
would have purged us, and we would not be purged; thou would have cured
us, but we would not be cured. Th^se, and all other our sins, O Lord, let us
recount before thee, with true sorrow and astonishment of heart. But do not
thou, O Father, straightly mark iniquities; nor deal with us as we have
deserved. Truth Lord, unto us belongs nothing, but confusion and
condemnation: but unto thee compassion and forgiveness, though we have
grievously rebelled against thee. Thou have in thy word proclaimed thy self
unto us, to be The Lord, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, forgiving
iniquity, transgression, and sin. Thou have made many faithful promises,
that thou will be found of them that seek and sue for mercy unto thee. Thou
have satisfied thy Justice in the accursed death of thy Son, our surety and
Savior, Jesus Christ, for the sins of the whole word of thine elect. Thou
have given us of thy Spirit, whereby even we, sinful wretches, are taught, and
inclined, to forgive for thy sake such as have offended us: how much more will thou show thy self a faithful and merciful God to pardon all our sins, and
to cleanse us from all unrighteousness? Wherefore O Lord hear, O Lord forgive,
O Lord consider, n^ give a gracious answer unto our supplication, for the
Lords sake.

Yea Lord, teach us to rise up with thy Majesty, against our sins, that our
war with them may assure us that we have peace with thee. Let us not be such
traitors to thy Majesty, as to harbor thine enemies. Break of in ^uerie one
of us the wicked customs of sinning: abolish the power and dominion thereof:
crucify the love and affection thereto. Let us, in the bloody passion of our
dear Savior, see the ougly face, hear the dreadful cry, and feel the
intolerable burden of our transgressions. And let us not, as if the load were
yet too light, let us not (blessed God) add more unto the weight and measure
of our sins: but rather let us, in our proportion, bear part in the
sufferings of our Savior; ceasing from sin for his sake, who for our sakes
refused not to offer up his innocent soul a sacrifice for sin.

Lord teach us to do thy will. Knit our hearts unto thee, that we may fear
thy name. Let thy good Spirit lead us in all the paths of righteousness, and
make our barren nature fruitful in good works. Quicken us, O Lord, for thy
names sake, with the life of grace: and stablish our hearts with thy free
Spirit. Teach us freely to submit our selves to the easy yoke, and light
burden of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let thy grace so frame us unto hearty
obedience, that thy commandment may not be grievous unto us. Let thy love in
Christ Jesus be so shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, that no
difficulties may discourage us in the way of well doing. Let the meditation of
the glorious kingdom prepared for us, so possess and affect us, that the love
of this present world may seem base, and unworthy of us. Let the expectation
of the sudden coming of our Lord Jesus Christ so awaken us, that the
momentanie pleasures of sin, or cares of this life, may not lull us a sleep,
and ensnare us.

Watch over us this night by thy gracious providence, preserve us from the
dangers of the darkness: refresh us with the moderate use of thine ordinance
of rest and sleep: raise us up with health of body, and cheer of heart, to
the duties of the next day. Let thy kindness and mercy follow us all the
days of our life. Bring us in peace, with good report, especially with a good
conscience, unto the bed of the grave; that after the sleep of death, we may
awake unto blessed immortality.

Preserve thy whole Church, and add thereto, from day to day, such as shall be
saved. Be merciful to this Land: forgive the common and crying sins, of
profaneness, worldliness, cruelty, and abuse of thy long patience, and
liberal blessings; especially of thy Gospel. Give grace unto all estates,
truly to return unto thee, and to seek thy face and favor. Especially pour
down a liberal shower of all bodily and spiritual blessings on the Kings
Majesty, with the Queen, and Royal family; sanctify, and assist the
Magistrates, and Ministers. Continue these blessings of peace, and of thy
Gospel, unto the posterity after us. Bless all that love us, and are by any
band linked, or allied unto us. Yea take pity of those that causelessely hate
us. Show us all, O Lord, thy mercy in this life, and in the life to come,
grant us thy salvation; through Jesus Christ, thine only Son, and our alone
Savior. To whom with thee, O Father, and thy blessed Spirit, be all praise,
power, dominion, and obedience, henceforth and for ever. Amen.

FINIS.
