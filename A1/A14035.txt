Mistress Turners Farewell to all women.
Angel (turned Devil) Pride:
by thee I fell
When here on earth I dwelt
too'th pit of Hell:
Yet spite of all thy Poisons,
I am fair
Now in Gods eyes,
Women by me Beware.





Mistress Turner.
1 THou, of all sins the first, of all, the highest,
Because thou fell'st from Heaven before Man's fall,
Who, (when to Happiness thou were the nighest,)
In envy of the best of all, lost all.
2 Woe worth that whorish face of thine, which tempted
Me to more Hells then thou have vain attires,
For which my spotted Soul, is not exempted
(With out Gods mercy) from eternal fires.
3 Shee-Diuell, (destroyer both of man and Woman,
That with thy forcerous Drugges did catch my Soul:
To the last Bar Tribunal, thee I summon,
Where I shall stand all white, thou black and foul.
4 Washd are my spots away by Christ's red passion,
For I am there whence headlong thou were thrown:
And now I glory in triumphant fashion,
That thou art there whether I should have gone:
From Heaven thou fellst to Hell, and I being drowned
In Sins, got up and now in Heaven sit Crowned.
Lady Pride.
1 THou, of all Women worst of all, the basest,
Who (when I am of Sins the worst and proudest,
And thrown from Heaven me in thy bosom placest;
And what thy heart loved best, now rail'st ar loudest.
2 It Is not thy hate of Pride, makes thee to cry
Woe worth my Whorish Face, but it is because
Thy Pride has caught her fall, and thou must dye,
And frighted art with Hels devouring Jaws.
3 Enough it is for me that I have made thee
Drunk with my cup: nor care I though thou boast
That from eternal fires Gods mercy staid thee;
For say thy soul be saved, thy bodies lost.
4 As for thy yellowed Ruffes, fantastic Tires,
Paintings, and Poysonings (now by thee abhorred)
I laugh to see thee wrap them up in fires,
For Pride has more to bewitch many a Forehead.
And though thy soul should climb the highest Sphere,
I Will pluck down thousands that shall nere come there.
Printed for John Trundle.
