The preface. To the king our most gracyous sovereign lord. Frauncys By god
knight / his humble and true faithful subject / and daily orator / wissheth
daily augmentatyon and increase of grace and honor.
I Did not perfytly know (most gracious / most christen / and most vyctorious
prince) how that among all other virtues / that the virtuous gifts given by
grace only / through the goodness of almighty god / of the incomparable
gift of gentelnesse and humanyte / did so habundantly / accumulately / and so
manifestly possess and reygne in your noble and princely heart / till that
now it appears manifestly by your exteryour noble acts and deeds / for else
undoubtedly I would not only have been a shamed so to attempt rudely / folysshly
/ and rather presumptuouslye to trouble and disquyet such an imperyall majesty
with this my rude and barbarouse writynge / in the hynderaunce of your godly
and spiritual studies / with which your highness takes such intolerable
pain: as well to set forth the mere / sincere / and true glory of god / as
also thestablysshment / quietness and unity of this your christen commonwealth. But also in mine own conceyte and opinyon / calling to remembrance my
great and manyfolde in suffycyency in learning / to write unto so mighty and
famous a prince / I should even by and by have dysalowed mine own behauyoure
in that behalf / and iuged my self worthy of blame. But now consyderi^ge
most benign souereygne lord / how much all your subjects be imperpetually
bound to laud / praise / and glorify almightye god / to send unto us so
christen a ki^ge to have rule and governance over us yor subjects / by whose
great and inestymable dilygente labor / charge / study and pain / we be
delivered from the hard / sharp / and.x. M. times more tha^ iudicyall
captiuytie of that babylonycall man of Rome / to yt sweet and soft service /
ye / rather lyberty of ye gospel / I can for my part no less do / tha^ to
present to your grace some thing thereby to declare how gladly I would give
thanks to your highness / for such profet as I among others have received by
this said benefit i^ our delyuerau^ce which act is of it self so hyghly to
the great peace / unity / and wealth of this most noble empire of England / that
if there were non other cause but that only / we were bound to / and with all
our dilygence and industry / to study / labor / and deuyse how this benefyte
exceeding all other / might world without end be extolled / praised / and
made immortal / and to receyte how much the furtherau^ce of gods glory is by
the same act set forth and aduau^ced / my learning ne yet wit will not serve
me. Yet I dare boldly afferme / pondering and consydering depely theffecte and
cyrcumstance of this matter. This act is no less worth than well worthy to be
set in the book of kings of the old testamente / as a thing sou^dynge to
gods honor / as much as any other history therein contained. But what should
I attempt or go about to express ye condygne and everlasting praises and
thanks / which your majesty has deserved of all your hole cominalte for the
benefytes before named / unless I would take in hand like an evil workman /
which by reason of his vnperfeytnesse in his science / should utterly stayne
and deface the thing / he would most ernestly and dilyge^tly show and set fo:
th. I will therefore most exellent emperor of this realm / set all this aside
and show to your grace the cause of my enterprise / for somoche as I perceive
that all your gracious procedynges ar only driven and conveyed to ye most high
/ just / and sincere honor of almighty god / the publyke wealth and unity of
all christendom most specially of this yor most noble realm of England / it
has animated and encouraged me / accordi^ge to ye small talent of lerni^ge
that the lord has lent to me / to put your grace in reme^brane of the
intolerable pestilence of impropriations of benefices to relygyouse persons
(as they will be called) some to men and some to women which in mine opinion
is a thing plainly repugnant to ye most holy and blessed decrees and
ordynaunces of all mighty god / and highly to ye extolli^ge supporti^ge / and
mayntenance of ye usurped power of ye bishop of Rome / as your majesty shall
perceive in reding of this little treatise / which your grace not being
offended / I shall ever (god wylli^ge) be able justly to defend / and also
stop ye mouths of the^ that shall say and abide by the contrary and that not
with mine own words but with auctorities of holy scripture. And further I do
most humbly upon both my knees beseech yor imperyal majesty / that unto such
time as this my little book be clearly confuted by like holy scripture and
auctorities / as I have approved the same / that it may safely go abroad under
protection of your most gracious and redouted name. And for the prosperouse
preservation of your most royal estate of your most noble and virtuous
Queen / of your dear daughter lady princess / daughter and heir to you both
(according to my most bound duty) I shall daily pray / my life endurynge.

Finis.
A treatise concerning. etc.
TO recyte in one volume good christen reder / all the papisticall captivity
seductyon / and disceyte / wherewith many years the kings true and loving
subjects of this his most noble realm of England / pytuousely have been
deluded / begyled / and blinded: It should (I think) not only even abhor
the ears of all them that been good and virtuous / but also be a labor and
burdeyne to great and strange / for the learning of him that has no more than
I. Yea / and though my lerninge were a great deal more passing than it is /
and mine eloquence as good as ever was Demosthenes / yet all were one. Except
it be possible / and any thing lykely for a thing that is infynite to be
comprehended of that that is fynite. Therefore for this time ouerpassi^ge so
many things without end and reason / that is / to detecte the frauds and
gyles of the foresaid pastystes / both all and some / which is not possible. I
shall be content at this time to say my mind in one thing partyculer /
whereof hitherto no man that I know has any thing said or written / for a
reformatyon to be had in the abuse thereof. My meni^ge is of the craftye
iuggelynge / clean conueyaunce / and lewd legerdemayn used amongst some men
(ye know whom I mean) concerning the impropriatyons of benefyces. Of all
pestylent infections that ever invaded outher realm or regyon / the most
pernycyouse and dyemeterly repugnaunte against the blessed ordinance of
almighty god. Here now to boste (as some man would that were a ioyly papyst)
that I am suffyciente to confound and conuynce all them that would withstand
me in this one argument and cause / in dyspyte of all their subtle sophistry
and nyghe scraped scryptures / wrested out of frame / it shall not much need /
for my mind is with no man to contend or strive either much or little: But
plainly I entende to utter my co^scte^ce without either payntynge or colourynge
/ sophismes / or sophystrye / and after to leave the matter to the judgment of
them that been in authority / and may / when it shall like the^ well set a
redress / not only in this / but also in all other abuses not to be suffered.
Neither do I much regard the blind reasons and carnal persuatyons / that
may be brought for the defense of their feeble foundation / wherewith here
tofore they have allured the nobles of this realm / to impropriate (as they
call it) unto them such benefyces: for truth shall at length overcome all
their falshed. Truth may well be blamed / but it can never be shamed. Such is
thexellency and virtue of truth. For asmoch than as the cause of it self is so
heynouse / that it can with no conscience any longer be suffered of any
Christen stomach / but that it ought to be reclaymed at / of all well minded
people / both with heart and soul. And for as much as the truth stands
with me / both of good scripture and reason / that these impropriatyons be
false and abhomynable in the sight of god / as my judgment serves me / me
thinks I may right well without any suspect of temerytie / or any other evil
affectyon enter into the matter / which I entende and purpose.

I think no man to be so blind / but he knows that almightye god has
ordained in his faithful congregation of christen people / one special kind
of ministers / which are bounden before thadministratyon of all sacraments /
chefely and princypally to apply them self to the sincere declaratyon and
publysshynge of his most holy word and gospel this wytnessi^ge Paul by these
words: Non enim misit me deus vt baptizarem / sed vt eua^gelizem. Et alibi. Ve
mihi si no^ euangelizem.

The lord (says he) has not sent me to baptyse / but rather to preach. Yea
/ woe be to me (says he in a another place) if I do not preche. But what need
me to prove that men be bound to preche / when no man denies it? The thing
that we entende to prove / is to prove that impropriatyons are not to be
suffered / no / not of a Turk / if he will have his relygyon and law to
contynewe and florisshe. How much less than are they not to be promytted of a
christian man? Thauctour of whose relygion is another the pope nor Machomet / nor
yet any man / but even the living god / the god of all gods / and the
creator of heaven and earth. Now if ye grant me that me^ be bound to labor
in the vyneyard of the lord / and in the work of his gospel. I trow and
believe that it were not much against good reason / that a good workman / and
he that labors justly for his living / had as he is worthy / and as reason
and scripture will / a reward worthy / and according to his labor. For the
scripture says: Dignus est merceuarius mercedesua. A true work man is worthy
to have for his work. And I am sure that the Turk for very shame could not
deny this. But let us se more of the scripture. Paul says: Si nos vobis
spiritualia seminauimus / magnum est si carnalia vestra metamus: That is: If we
do minister unto you those things that been heavenly and spu^al do you think it
a high thing if we reap and receive of you again those that been but worldly
and transytorie things? And in another place: Quis suis stipendtis militat
vnque? Quis plantat vineam / et de fructu eius non edit? Quis pa scit gregem /
et de lacte gregis non manducat? This is: Who goth a warrefare any time at his
own proper charge? Who planteth a vyneyarde and eteth not of the fruit? Who
fedeth a flock and eteth not of the milk? Se you not here how vehemente
Paul is / in this that he would have the precher to be honestly found? Yea /
and to thentent that all the world may understand how fervent he is in this
matter: Mark also how he brings in the old law for him / as who should say:
If ye were / or be so unreasonable to deny these authorityes and reasons / that
I have here adduced and brought in / as things invented of mine own brains /
and as a new found holyday / devised with out authorite or counsel yet I trow
you neither will or can deny / but that long and many thousand years before
I was borne / or you either / it was well and substancyallye provided of god
almightye for his ministers and servants / which labored / or were
otherwise occupied at his commandment in his holy temple. Therefore (says
Paul) mark what the scripture says:

Qiscitis quonia^ hit qui in sacrario operant / que de sacrario sunt edunt.
etc. Do ye not (says he) understand / how that they which minyster in the
temple / have their finding of the temple? and that they which attend upon
thaultare / are partetakers of the aultare? Even so (says Paul) does the lord
ordeyne that they which preach the gospel / should live by the gospel. And
yet Paul here in thaduouchynge of ye old ordynance of god / made in his old
testament / enforces not to prove the payment of tithe / but all his dilygence
is to iustifye his doctrine to be no new learning / nor yet invented of his
own fantasy / but that in all times / and all ages / god would ever his
ministers to be honestly sustained and found. Now this confyrmed / stablysshed
/ and grounded / as I think it will be denied of few or none. I beseech you all
my lords ladies / and masters of impropriacyons / what other things ben your
impropriatio^s / than things directly fighting against gods holy ordyna^ce
against his holy will / against his most blessed pleasure / against his holy
spyrite? Finally against himself and all that is god. And consequently what
can ye make of them / but things abominable / things detestable / plain
theft and robberye. Yea / and more than twyse sacrylege. I beseech you what do
you call them: yea / and how much are they to be hated / that been but even
preuy pykepurses? were he less worthy than to be set upon the pyllary? But
what of him that robs a man even at noone in the kings high way? yea /
even in the mids of Poules church before all me^nes eyes? Be not you my
masters impropryatours / suppose ye even the same persons: If ye be and have been so / ever syns you stale unto you these impropriatyons / what would you
say / or what should the governors say? Should theft be let alone Should
sacrylege be suffered? should pykynge be painted? Yea / and at few words should
murder be maintained? But me thinks I here you whysper that ye be no
murderers / thieves / pykers / sacrylegyans / nor yet none of all this gear /
No ar not? Well / tha^ I se well we must have more to do with you. For as much
as ye deny the crime laid unto your charge. Ye shall understand that good
and virtuous men before our days / which loved the will of god / which
loved his holy pleasure / which regarded his commandment / whose medytatyons
and study both day and night was / to set forth his glory / to auau^ce his
blessed word / and to maynteine the ministers of the same / did (no dout of
it) with the consent of higher powers of kings and of princes / and of their
most honorable counsels / following (in this behalf) the old law / for the
most easyest way and spedyest prouisyo^ / appoint / assygne and ordeyne (for
the same ministers to be maynteyned) decymations or tithes / willing and
minding by this good prouisyon / that within every congregation or parysshe /
the minister of gods word there / should be sure at all times of a living
raised and gathered of these said decymations / and therein to have added a
certain name / calling it a benefyce / personage or vycarage / and likewise
turnynge the name of a minister or curate / to the name of a person or vycare.
Furthermore ordering that one man shall have authorite / as patron / to name
this parsone / and so to give this same benefyce: albet / peradventure that
other in the same parysshe give as much to the annual living of the parsone
as the patron does. Besides this / they ordained him a mantion to dwell in
among them / to then tente that for his dilygente administration / he should
have every thing necessary for him within his own governance: yea / and have
it brought even home unto him / to dyspose at his pleasure / as it shall be
most expedyent and necessary for him / that the more quyetly he might study
and apply him self to minister unto the^ the pure word of god / and to be
ever ready at hand to enstructe them of all things necessary for ye health of
their souls / and to be their true watch man and shepherde to take them from
the rauysshynge wolf / and like a good true herdesman / a pastoure to go before
them in spirytuall and virtuous conversation: and ever wha^ they be scabbed to
anoynte the^ gentely with the soft and sweet salve of gods word / all
rancoure and strife laid a part. Now my masters impropriated or improper
masters how say ye by your fathers / have not you with your crafty
collusyon / almooste through England / dystroyed these holy and godly
prouysyons / made for the mayntenance of gods holy word / and for
thadministratyon of this most blessed sacraments / for the health / wealth / and
saluatyon of man's soul / for the vpholdynge of the true and catholyque faith
/ for the supportacyon of virtue / and dystruction of vice. Have not you (I
say) by the glykynge and gleynyng / snatchynge and scratchi^ge / tatchynge and
patchynge / scrapi^ge and rakynge together of almost all the fat benefyces with
in this realm and impropriatynge the^ unto your selves / distroyed this most
godly and holy prouisyon / bereyued the people of ye word of god / of ye true
knowledge of ye blessed sacraments / of their true believe and faith in god the
father / and the blood of Jesus Christ. For how can the people have any faith
in god without preachinge? How should they have any preaching when ye have
robbed the^ of their ministers? How should the ministers serve the^ when ye
have robbed them of theirs living? If the people have no faith how can they
have charity? If they have no charytie / what merueyle is it / if they run
hedlonge and be carried from one vice to another / from one mischefe to another?
Be not ye thoccasyon of all this? Who is else I pray you? Have not ye the
impropriations? Be the impropriacyons any thing else saving benefyces as
parsonages / and such like? Do we not say such an abbot is parsone here /
such a priour is parsone here? yea / such a prioresse is parsone here? How
say ye? think ye that me^ be foles? think ye that they ben asses? think ye
that they ben stocks and stones / blocks and bones? Think ye that we
understand no more reason than a great menye of you do? Is not this
abomination? Is this tolerable? Of all the premysses / I conclude / that if
it be necessary that the right honor and glory of god be of all men (and
specially by the ministers of the church) to be preferred / extolled / and
exalted (as most worthy is) above all things and names both in heaven / hell /
and in erih: if his glory (I say) is only to be sought / if his doctrine and
commandment to be regarded if the faith in his only son to be esteemed
and valued / if his sacraments are to be reverenced / if his sheep and lambs
are to be fed / and not pyned / if the soul of a christen man be any thing
worth / if the holy ghost is any thing to be desired / if all virtue and
goodness / if peace and quietness are to be wysshed of / if al good men / if
murder / blodshedyng incest and rauyne / with all other kinds of
inconuenyentes and myschef are to be abhorred of all men. Tha^ I say / that my
improper masters and dames are to be dispysed of all men / to be aduoyded and
fled of all men / to be shonned of all me^ / for that that they have been the
undoing of all men / in taking away / adnullynge / abolysshynge of god and
all virtues / of his blessed laws and gospel / of faith and baptyme / and all
other holy sacraments: and that for as much as by their improper
impropriations / the ministers of gods holy word and faith / for lack of
living be taken from us / which should enstructe us in all truth and verytie
expedyent for us. But here ye will say that we have teachinge enough / and
that there is never the less preaching for you. Whereunto I answer that in
deed / if the matter be expended after your affectyons / I think we had
inought / although we never had no preaching at all / for your mind
paradue^ture could serve you well enough / that we had as many prechynges as
there grow plummes in a pease wyspe. And where ye say / that there be never the
fewer for you: That is spoken even as such men should speak: For in deed /
althougbe we had prechinge and techynge inoughe / yet for your parts / as
much as lies in you / both god and all preaching / and all other holy
things ben clean extyncte and rydde / and specially this holy ordinance put
out of the way. But now ye will obiecte that no ordinance of god is broken /
hindered / or prohibyted on your behalf i^ this matter: For though the
benefyce be impropriate to a monster / I would say to a monasterye / yet
thabbot or prioure appoynteth a monk or chanon to be the minister / and to
preche the word of god to the parysshe / who shall tarry and abide among his
parysshoners / and have out of the same benefyce a suffycyente living / and
the rest thereof to come home to thabbot and his brethren: and this is no
brekynge of gods ordinance / but rather a turnynge of it to a better use.
Whereunto I answer / that where any such vicare or minyster is instytuted of
his abbot or priour / and trewly labors in thadministration of gods word
/ it is not only well done to give him a suffycyent living out of the same
benefyce / but also he were well worthy to have it every whitte / and as for the
rest that haboundeth / let him keep hospytalyte / as Paul commands / or of
necessytie wylleth him to do / and I say / there shall but little remain to
send home to thabbot / and if he do not keep hospytalyte of the rest / than is
he a thief / and thabbot another / for the rest is the poor indygentes. But
how faithful and dilygent such men be so instytuted by abbottes and priours
to preach the word of god / and how sore they be therewith charged by their
heedes. I think though I would cloak it / yet theffecte will not suffer it. Yea
/ I believe rather that they be^ the strong persecutours of gods word /
rather than the furtherers thereof. I would I might in this point lie / but I
am sorye that it is so true. But now these men being never without excuses /
may peradventure think this to be a good answer for me. We pray for the
souls of them that have improperated such benefyces unto us / and sing mass
and diryge for them / and set up tapers for them to burn both day and night.
Whereunto first I say / that if a man demanded of you an account to be given
of your so doing / asking you who taught you to apply ye blessed mass that
way / with the psalms and lessons in the diryge contained / and desired you to
show scripture for it / I think peradventure that ye might come short home of
a wise answer / which if ye can make / I think there is no man but he will be
well content there with. Furthermore / we grant that ye scripture commends
much ye prayer of a just man / but we be not yet fully agreed that ye be those
just men of whom the scripture means. Again / albeit that it might be
justified (as I trow it will never be) that ye ben even the very self same
men / yet when will ye prove us that ye ought to have a living for your prayer.
If ye come in and answer that: Oignus est operarius mercedesua. The labourer
is worthy to have his reward for his pain: We answer / that those words were
never mante in that sense / nor of no such laborers. And of this we have a
good proof in ye.xxiii. of Mat. where Christ rebukes the scrybes and
pharyseis eue^ for the same manner of living that ye use / that is to say / by
cause they would live like idle belyes / under the pretense / that day and
night they prayed for the people to whom Christ said: Woe be to you scrybes and
pharyseis: yea / but why? Forsooth says Christ / even therefore / because that
under the pretense and color of long prayers / ye eat up the houses or
substance of the wydowes / for the which ye shall be full sore punysshed.
How say ye / might not the scrybes and pharyses have brought in: Oignus est
mercenarius mercede sua / Against Christ? Think you they were not learned as
well as you: but they knew full well it could not serve. Ye will say
peradventure yt ye be not scrybes and some men say / that ye look as like
them / as a horse looks like a mare: and yet a horse is not a mare / nor a
mare a horse: but yet they be both of one kind: and so be you say they and the
pharyseis. Here now lies the matter and bledeth / you standing at your
negative / and they at their affirmatyue: Therefore how might this matter be
discussed? Forsooth I ca^ not se but we must be feign to impanell a jury of.xii.
honest me^. But in ernest / albeit that ye might as well live by prayer as the
precher may of the gospel / yet me thinks that good honesty would / yt
first ere ye take any money for it / ye made a good proof that ye world were
the better for your prayer / and that ye could make men sure to do the^ good
with your prayer / orelles I can not tell what I should say. And again in
case ye might have a living by the scripture for your prayer / and that ye
were those same good and just men / the prayer of whom the scripture so much
enhaunseth / yet I beseech you where have ye that scripture that techeth you to
take the living from the prechers / and to rob the^ of their lyuynges / and
the people of the living of the soul / and of faith / charity / and all
goodness / and to live upon stolen goods? Some men that favor these new
found sects / will peradventure say: Well / yet it is better these monks /
chanons / and such like have the impropriatyons (which though they preche not
/ yet they keep some hospitalyte) rather than the seculer prestes should have
them / as they have had before / which keep no hospitalyite nor preche another.
To this it is easy to answer: That it is not mete that any man what soever he
be / should receive the benefyte or fruit of a precher / onles he do his duty
therefore. Qui administrat euangeliu^ / ex eua^gelio viuat: That is / he that
ministers / techeth and precheth the word of god / is right worthy to live
upon / and by the gospel: and to preche he is bound / if he will receive such
wages / under ye pain of dampnatyon (as we preued a little before by
thauthorite of the same Paul) if he be not let by god / that is that is to say
by sycknesse / and if he do not preche he is worthy to have no penye of such
fruits / albeit he mumble up never so many mate^ses / David psalters /
trentals / diryges / and such like long prayers / as we proved before wha^ we
spoke of long prayers. For this is a good argument: He preaches dilygently
and trewly: Ergo / he is worthy to have therefore a living / and even so is
this: He does neither of the^ / ergo / he can challenge no living: and this is
Paul's mind / when he says: He that minystreth the word of god / must live
thereby: except peradventure ye can prove that to mu^ble up a long pair of
mattens be to preche the word of god / which if ye can bring to conclusyon /
by my truth ye have won the maistrye for me / for I trust than / that when
I say my mattens / that my mattens may stand for a simple collation as well
as your mattens: and than I se not but that an impropriation were as wholesome
for my body as for yours. And where it may be objected that over that / that
the prestes keep none hospytalytie / they neither preach at their benefyces /
nether come at them neither yet ever look thytherwarde some of them: yea / and
if it chance some of them to preach / it is such gear / that it were more
for the health of his parisshens souls that he were tongue tied. Forsooth that is
even as true as the gospel: yea / and so true that it makes mine heart weep
to think upon it. I beseech god ones to amend it when his will is. Is it not
great pitye to se a man to have three or four benefyces: yea / paraduenture
half a score or a dosyn / which he never comes at / but sets in every one
of them a sir John^ lack laten / that can scarce read his porteus / orels
such a rauenynge wolf as can do nothing but devour thesely sheep with his
false doctrine / and suck their substance from them. Lord / if it be thy
pleasure / ones have mercy upon us / and give grace that we may have some
remedy found for this myschiefe / both of impropriatyons / and also of them
that minister not the word of god faithfully upon their benefyces: as they
ought to do: for I have known such / that when they have rydde^ by a benefyce
whereof they have been person / they could natte tell that is was their
benefyce.

This is a wonderful blyndnesse. And yet I think / such or the same
benefyced man will natte stycke to ride an hundredth miles / to prycke a brouche
upon an image cote / and think it a right high merytoriouse deed. But to
such time as it shall please the kings most honorable majesty / of his
benygne mercy and pytie / with his most honorable counsel to se a reformation
/ as well for thabuse of impropriatyons as for the incharytable demeanoure of
all benefyced men / that be not resydent and abiding upon their benefices /
there to do their bounde^ duty. It shall never be well in this church of Christ
in England / whereof his grace is the supreme heed / nor yet ye truth of
gods holy word shall ever go forward in his right trade and kind. They
have yet an other abiectyon / and this is it: If impropriatyons be taken from
monasteryes / say they / than could they keep no houses nor hospytalyte / but
should be compelled to live all in pouertye. Where unto I answer / that as for
pouertye it is their professyon / and stands with their own monastycall
rules: for they all profess the same at their first entering into relygyon:
yea / and it must be wylfull poverty also / wherefore I can not se by their
professyo^ but that they ben bound to help to all things that stands with
pouertye. And as for kepi^ge hospitalyte with stolen goods of impropriatyons
/ I think it can not veil them but little to allege it / wherefore this
obiectyon is not worth a straw / and may better be called an abiectyon /
than an obiectyon. Besides this I know very few or none / but and if these
impropriatyons were clean taken away from them: yea / and a great dele more /
yet should they have more left in their hands than ever had Benedict /
Bernard / Dominik / or Fraunces / or yet Brimo: ye / more than many men think
or can think well bestowed upon them. But and a man might (saving their
pacyence) be so bold with them / what matter were it (under correction I speak)
if all these improfytable sects / and strong sturdye route of idle paunches
were a little poorer / to the end that the true relygion of christ mit thereby
somthynge be set up and a vaunsed / and syffycient company of the ministers
of gods true word provided for in all parttes. I pray you / what an idle
sort be found and brought up in Abbeyes / that never will labor whiles they
ben there / nor yet when they come thence to other men's scruyce / in so much
that there goth a comen proverb: That he which has ones ben in an abbey will
ever more after be slouthefull / for the which cause they ben called of many
men / Abbey loutes or lubbers. And some say that many of our holy fathers
spend not a little upon my cosyn Jane / Elsabeth and Marget (ye know what I
mean) insomoche that / yt eue^ they which be most popysshe of all / and know
none other god almost than the great drafsacke of Rome / can not deny this to be
true. Which popysshe persons not withstanding will not ones open their lyppes
to sue for a reformation to the king our most sovereign lord. And the cause
why / as it is noysed / and as good sygnifycatio^s ben thereof given / is for
that / that some such abbot or priour will not stycke to give an hundredth
pou^des at a clappe to such a cha^pyon to speak in his favor in time of need.
And I can believe it well: for I se no me^ in the world have mo sure stakes to
stand with the^ when they have any urgent business than the monks have even of
them that know their noughty co^uersatyon / as well as I know my right hand
from my lift. Now what should cause men to be so untrusty in a matter of
untruth / let other men judge. I can guess no matter or cause more lykely / than
Huri sarra fames (as Vergyll calls it) that is: the myscheuouse and
insacyable hunger and covetousness of gold. And I fere me that even at this
day / money passes fast from merchant to merchant. A thing there is in the
wind / what soever it be / that every man knows not of / which I trust in
god will one day come to light / as well as other things have: for I dout not
but christ is true / which says: Qihil est absconditum quod non reuelabitur.
There is nothing so craftily co^ueted but at the last it will and shall come to
revelation. But what myschef care they to commit if they may redeem it for
money / and may have such ioly fellows to defend the^ in every corner? what
care they for the loss of a little money / which they ca^ find again in the
sore labor of their poor tena^tes How so ever the world go they lose
nothi^ge / nor will lose nothing / nor will eat the less by one cro^me or bit
of bread: Be there never so great darth in ye world / yet will they mesure
their meat by the belly. As there was a blide abbot in ye world which never
would set hi^ down at dinner / but he would first undo ye point before his belly
/ and let it out a certain length / and to such time he had filled his
paukener to the point / he would never cesse as blide as he was. Mary some me^
say / yt he would seldom make any souper: and I think verily he neded not
much. But to my purpose / remove me ones away ye cause material of all these
inco^uenyentes and theffect shall sone be removed. But as for to remove yt cause
efficient from them / that is / the spirit of the devil / it were very hard.
For that can no man do but god / which can make a Camel to go through the eye
of an edle: but as for the cause materyall / or their infinyte so^mes of riches
/ of gold and of silver / may soon be removed / if it plese our most
redouted prince / with his most honorable counsel. Take from them their
i^proper impropriations with other superfluytes / and within a while
peradventure they may be good men. And if not that / yet am I sure yt outwardly
they shall not be a quarter part so ill as they be now. It were well done me
thi^keth that such me^ had their impropriations as would do faithful service
to god / to their prince / and to their parissh / in prechynge / setti^ge forth
syncerely and purely the word of ye living god: and other that will not or ca^
not so do / it were best they were clearly dyspatched of such benefyces as
they have what ki^de of bn^fyces soever they be great or small / forked cap or
plai^e cap according to. s. Paul's mi^de. Qui no^ laboret / no^ manducet. He yt
will take no pains / let hi^ take no gains: but if he will needs eat / let hi^
needs sweet / orels let hi^ eat his thombes. How say ye now all my lords /
abbottes and priours with your improper ipropriations? which of good congruence
god put in your mind so to call / as he did into bishop Cayphas mi^de ones to
say the truth against his will: for if all ye world had sought a name for
them / he could never have devised a better word than impropriations: for in
good faith they were never proper unto you by the word of god: but even as
fair stolen good as any is in christendom. How say ye (I say) Have ye any
thing to allege for you against my poor reasons: if ye have / come forth and
ye shall be herd. I will not yt ye lay for you / your old ryueld refuge this
did our fathers / there has been as wise men as there be now: why did not they
espy this gear? Tell not me what your faders did / which were blinded with such
fathers as ye ben your self. But tell me whether your fathers i^ so doing did
well or not / and according to the scripture or not. And as for wisdom I tell
you again / that there is but one wisdom / that we may surely trust unto
which is the wysdom of god left in his scryptures / if they ca^ prove that
their fact and deed in gyui^ge impropriatio^s to such as ye be / was grounded
upon this wisdom / tha^ we will and must needs admyt it and them to be wise /
or else in things perteyning to ye soul / we will approve no wisdo^e but that.
Think you this a good solutio^ to say: Were there not as wise me^ before our
time as there be now? Ar ye not a shamed of such extreme madness? I pray you tell
me one thing Were there not as great foles before our times as there be now?
and I beseech you / why mit not our fathers ye made these same impropriations
be of that same sort. I promise you except you had the^ with this condition /
that ye should trewly preche the word of god for the^. I ensure you it was the
most fond and folysh act (one of the^) that ever was done: ye / and a noughty
act also: If at the last it were their act / and not rather your tyra^nouse
usurpation. But admyt ye al your forfaders were wise both tagge and rag / and
not one fool amongst them / what than? is this a good argument? Our fore
faders were as wise before our time as me^ be now: Ergo this was wisely done? I
pray you who taut you so to reason? many a wise man sometime may play the fool
/ and over slyp himself? If he may / than (as the northen man says) Gay layke
you with your old wisdom / and your wise fathers. And so help me god and
holydom / if yor wise faders never played wyser touches than they did in this
behalf / me thi^keth you might as well a another while allege upon yor wise
mothers / and what soever your faders were / me thinks their sons be not
the wysest yt ever I knew. Finally if thus much may persuade you / that your
impropriations of conscience ca^ not be kept any longer. I beseech you for the
love of god / if any drop of grace be in you / to give place to the si^ple and
plain truth which I have here set forth / with out either subtilite or colors
/ as the things where unto I never gave my mi^de / nor entendeth to do. But if
ye ca^ not give place to ye poor reasons here made / set your pe^nes to the
book / and as well as god will give me grace ye shall be answered. And here I
make an end / nothing medlynge with the patronage of ye seyde impropriations to
who^ they shall be long / nor yet with the persons to who^ such benefyces
ought to be given / nor what order is to be taken about the^: but I commend al
such persels to them that be of more experyence and learning than I / and to
them that be in authorite / as to our most gracious lord and prince / of all
other princes the most exellent and worthy / and to his most honorable counsel
to whom with our most virtuous queen Anne / and princess Elizebeth / and all
their honorable counsel / be long life and joy to the pleasure of god.

So be it I beseech Jesus.
