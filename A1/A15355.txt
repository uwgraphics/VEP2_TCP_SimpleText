THE Painful Adventures of Pericles Prince of Tire.

Being The true History of the Play of Pericles, as it was lately presented by
the worthy and ancient Poet John Gower.



AT LONDON. Printed by T. P. for Not: Butter, 1608.

The Argument of the whole History.
ANtiochus the Great, who was the first founder of Antioch, the most famous
City in all Syria, having one only daughter, in the prime and glory of her
youth, fell in most unnatural love with her; and what by the power of his
persuasions, and fear of his tyranny, he so prevailed with her yielding heart,
that he became master of his desires; which to continue to himself, his
daughter, being for her beauty desired in marriage of many great princes, he
made this law, That whosoever presumed to desire her in marriage, and could not
unfold the meaning of his questions, for that attempt should loose his life.
Fearelesse of this Law, many Princes adventured, and in their rashness
perished: amongst the number PERICLES the Prince of Tire, and neighbor to this
tyrant King Antiochus, was the last who undertook to resolve this Riddle,
which he accordingly, through his great wisdom, performed: and finding both
the subtlety and sin of the Tyrant, for his own safety fled secretly from
Antioch back to Tire, and there acquainted Helycanus a grave Counsel our of
his with the proceedings, as also with his present fear what might succeed,
from whose counsel he took advise, for a space to leave his kingdom, and
betake himself to travel; to which yielding, Pericles puts to sea, ariues at
Tharsus, which he finds (through the dearth of corn) in much distress: he
there relieues Cleon and Dyonysa with their distressed City, with the provision
which he brought of purpose; but by his good Counselor Helycanus hearing
news of Antiochus death, he intends for Tire, puts again to Sea, suffers
shipwreck, his ships and men all lost, till (as it were) Fortune tired with
his mis-happes, he is thrown upon the shore, relieved by certain poor
Fishermen, and by an Armor of his which they by chance dragged up in their
nets, his misfortunes being a little repaired, Pericles arriues at the Court
of good Symonides King of Pentapolis, where through his nobleness both in
Arms and Arts, he winnes the love of fair Thaysa the kings daughter, and by
her fathers consent marries her.

In this absence of his, and, for which absence the Tyrians his subjects
muteny, would elect Helycanus (whom Pericles ordained his substitute in his
absence) their King, which passion of theirs Helycanus by his grave persuasions
subdewed, and won them to go in quest of their lost Prince Pericles: In this
search he is found, and with his wife Thaysa, who is now with child, and
Lycorida her Nurse; having taken leave of his kingly Father, puts again for
Tire, but with the terror of a tempest at Sea, his Queen falls in travel,
is delivered of a daughter, whom he names Marina, in which childe-birth his
Queen dies, she is thrown over boorde, at departure of whom Pericles
alters his course from Tire, being a shorter cut, to his host Cleon in
Tharsus; he there leaves his young daughter to be fostered up, vowing to
himself a solitary and pensive life for the loss of his Queen.

Thaysa thus supposed dead, and in the seas buried, is the next morning on the
shore taken up at Ephesus by Cerimon a most skillful Physician, who by his Art
practiced upon this Queen, so prevailed, that after five hours intraunced,
she is by his skill brought to able health again, and by her own request, by
him placed to live a Votary in Dianaes Temple at Ephesus. Marina Pericles
sea-borne daughter, is by this grown to discreet years, she is envied of
Dyonysa Cleons wife, her foster mother, for that Marinaes perfection exceeds
a daughter of hers, Marina by this envy of hers should have been murdered,
but being rescued by certain Pirates, is as it were reserved to a greater
mishap, for by them she is carried to Metelyne, sold to the devils broker a
bawd, to have bin trained up in that infection, she is courted of many, and
how wonderfully she preserues her chastity.

Pericles returns from Tire toward Tharsus, to visit the hospitable Cleon,
Dyonysa, and his young daughter Marina, where by Dyonysaes dissembling tears,
and a Toombe that was erected for her, Pericles is brought to believe, that his
Marina lies there buried, and that she died of her natural death, for whose
loss he tears his hair, throws off his garments, forsweares the society
of men, or any other comfort. In which passion for many months continuing, he
at last arriues at Metelyne, when being seen and pitied by Lysimachus the
Governor, his daughter (though of him unknown so) is by the Governor sent
for, who by her excellent skill in Song, and pleasantness in discourse, with
relating the story of her own mishap, she so winnes again her fathers lost
senses, that he knows her for his child, she him for her father; in which
ouer-ioy, as if his senses were now all confounded, Pericles falls asleep,
where in a dream is by Diana warned to go to Ephesus, and there to make his
sacrifice. Pericles obayes, and there comes to the knowledge of Thaysa his
wife, with their several Joys that they three so strangely divided, are as
strangely met. Lysimachus the Governor marries Marina, and Pericles leaving
his mourning, causes the bawd to be burned. Of his revenge to Cleon and
Dyonysa, his rewarding of the Fishermen that relieved him, his justice toward
the Pirates that made sale of his daughter, his return back to his kingdom,
and of him and his wifes deaths. Only entreating the Reader to receive this
History in the same manner as it was under the habit of ancient Gower the
famous English Poet, by the Kings Majesty's Players excellently presented.

THE Painful Adventures of PERICLES Prince of Tire.
The first Chapter.
WHerein Gower describes how Antiochus surnamed the Great committed incest with
his daughter, and beheaded such as sued to her for marriage, if they could not
resolve his question, placing their heads upon the top of his Castle gate,
whereby to astonish all others that came to attempt the like.

THe great and mighty king Antiochus, who was as cruel in tyranny, as he was
powerful in possessions, seeking more to enrich himself by she was, than to
renown his name by virtue, caused to be built the goodly City of Antioch in
Syria, and called it after his own name, as the chiefest seat of all his
Dominions, and principal place of his abode. This Antiochus had increase by
his Queen one only daughter, so excellent in beauty, as if Nature and all
Perfection had long studied to seem only absolute at her birth. This Lady
growing to like ripeness of age, as she had full endowment of outward
ornaments, was resorted unto by many youthful Princes, who desired her in
marriage, offering to make her Ioynture as noble in possessions, as she by
beauty was royal in her self. While the King her father evermore requiring
deliberation upon whom rather than other to bestow this his so inestimable a
Jewel, he began suddenly to have an unlawful concupiscence to grow in
himself, which he augmented with an outrageous flame of cruelty sparkling in
his heart, and accounted her so worthy in the world, that she was too worthy
for any, but himself. Thus being wrapped with this unnatural love, he
sustained such a conflict in his thoughts, wherein Madness puts Modesty to
flight, giving over his affections to the unlawfulness of his will, rather
then subdued them with the remembrance of the evil he had then in practice,
so that not long after coming into his daughters Chamber, and commanding all
that were near at her attendance to depart, as if he had had some careful and
fatherly business, the necessity of whose import desired some private
conference with her, he began to make motion of that unjust love to her,
which even Lust it self, had it not in a father been so brased with
impudency, would have blushed but even to have thought upon. Much persuasion,
though to little reason, he used, as, that he was her father, whom she was
bound to obey, he was a King that had power to command, he was in love, and
his love was resistlesse, and if resistlesse, therefore pitiless, either to
youth, blood, or beauty: In brief, he was a tyrant and would execute his will.
These words thus uttered with that vehement passion which such sinful
Lovers fit themselves unto in such desires, and such immodest sillables were
by him contracted together, that my pen grubbes to recite them, and made the
school of his daughters thoughts, (wherein were never taught such evils) to
wonder at the strangeness, as understanding them not, and at last, to demand
of her unkingly father, what he meant by this, when he forgetting the fear of
heaven, love to his child, or reputation amongst men; though by her withstoode
with prayers and tears, (while the power of weakness could withstand)
throwing away all regard of his own honesty, he unloosed the knotte of her
virginity, and so left this weeping branch to wyther by the stock that
brought her forth; so fast came the wet from the sentinells of her ransackt
city, that it is improper to say they dropped and rayned down tears, but
rather, that with great floods they powered out water. It is beyond imagination
to think whether her eyes had power to receive her sorrows brine so fast as
her heart did send it to them. In brief, they were now no more to be called
eyes, for griefs water had blinded them: and for words, she had not one to
utter, for betwixt her hearts intent, and tongues utterance, there lay such a
pile of lamentable cogitations, that she had no leisure to make up any of them
into words, till at the last, a Nurse that attended her coming in, and
finding her face blubbered with tears, which she knew were strange guests to
the table of her beauty, first standing in amaze thereat, at last, by the care
she had in charge of her, being more inheartned; Dear child and Madam (quoth
she) why sit you so sorrowfully? which question, getting way betwixt grief
and her vtteraunce, Oh my beloved Nurse, answered the Lady, even now two noble
names were lost within this Chamber, the name of both a Father, and a Child.
The meaning of which secret the Nurse understanding not, she entreated her to
be more plain, that by knowing the cause of her grief, she might use means
to redress it, or else, that her self in her own wisdom would alay the
violence of that tempest which did wrong to so goodly a building. But she
loath to be the bellows of her own shame, and blushing more to rehearse than
her Father was to commit, sat sighing, and continued silent, until Antiochus,
not satisfied with the fruit obtained by his former desire, returned, and like
him that by stealth has filched a taste from forth a goodly Orchard, is not
therewith contented, but either waits his opportunity to steal, till he be
glutted with his stealth, or so aduenturous, that he is taken, to his
everlasting shame; so this Antiochus coming back into the Chamber, and
finding his daughter as full of wette, as winter is, commanded the absence of
the Nurse (which she accordingly obeying) he began to persuade her, that
actions past are not to be redeemed, that what is in secret done, is no sin,
since the concealment excuses it, that evils are no evils, if not thought
upon, and that himself her Father had that power to gag all mouths from
speaking, if it were known. Besides her state, his greatness, his kingdom, her
beauty, were ornaments enough to draw the greatest Princes to join with her in
marriage, and he would further it. So with these and such like persuasions
preuayling with his daughter, they long continued in these foul and unjust
imbracements, till at last, the custom of sin made it accounted no sin.
And while this wicked Father showed the countenance of a loving fire abroad
in the eyes of his subjects, notwithstanding at home he rejoices to have
played the part of a husband with his own child, with false resemblaunce of
marriage: and to the intent he might always enjoy her, he invented a strange
policy, to compel away all suitors from desiring her in marriage, by
propounding strange questions, the effect and true meaning whereof was thus
published in writing, Whosoever attempteth and resolves me of my Question, shall
have my Daughter to wife: But whosoever attempteth and fails, shall loose his
head.

Which will of his, when Fame had blown abroad, and that by this his Law
there was found a possibility for the obtaining of this Lady, such was the
singular report of her surpassing beauty, that many Princes, and men of great
Nobility, to that purpose repaired thither, who not being able to explane his
Riddle propounded, lost their heads, which to the terrifying of others that
should attempt the like, were placed for open view on the top of his Castle
gate.

The second Chapter.
How Pericles arriving at Antioch, resolved the Kings Question: And how
Thalyart Antiochus Steward was sent to murder him.

VVHilest Antiochus continued thus exercising his tyranies on the lives of
several princes, Pericles the Prince of Tire, won with the wonderful report
of this Ladies beauty, was (as other Princes before) drawn to the undertaking
of this desparate adventure; and approaching near Antioch, where there were no
sooner news that he was coming, but there was as great a preparation for the
receiving of him, the Lords and Peers in their richest ornaments to intertaine
him. The people with their greedy and unsatisfied eyes to gaze upon him; for in
that part of the world there was in those days no Prince so noble in Arms, or
excellent in Arts, and had so general and deserved a report by fame as
Pericles Prince of Tire. Which drew both Peer and People, with a joyful and
free desire to allow him their imbracements, and to wish him happy success,
requiring no other but such a happy Sovereign to hope in: for so cunningly had
Antiochus dealt in this incest with his daughter, that it was yet unsuspected
of the nearest that attended him. With which solemnity and suffrages, being
brought into the presence of the tyrant, and by him demanded the cause of his
arrival at Antioch: and being by the Prince answered, that it was in love to
his daughter, and in hope to enjoy her by resolving of his question. Antiochus
then first began to persuade him from the enterprise, and to discourage him
from his proceedings, by showing him the frightfull heads of the former
Princes, placed upon his Castle wall, and like to whom he must exspect
himself to be, if like them (as it was most like) he failed in his attempt.
But Pericles armed with these noble armours, Faithfulness and Courage, and
making himself fit for Death, if Death proved fit for him, replied, That
he was come now to meet Death willingly, if so were his misfortune, or to be
made ever fortunate, by enjoying so glorious a beauty as was inthrond in his
princely daughter, and was there now placed before him: which the tyrant
receiving with an angry brow, threw down the Riddle, bidding him, since
persuasions could not alter him, to read and die, being in himself confident
the mystery thereof was not to be unfolded: which the Prince taking up, read
aloude, the purpose of which was in these words:

I am no viper, yet I feed
On mothers flesh, that did me breed;
I sought a husband, in which labor
I found that kindness from a father:
He Is Father, Son, and Husband mild,
I Mother, Wife, and yet his Child:
How this may be, and yet in two,
As you will live, resolve it you.
Which secret, whilst Prince Pericles was reading, Antiochus daughter, whether
it were, that she now lothed that unnecessary custom in which she had so
long continued, or that her own affection taught her to be in love with his
perfections, our story leaves unmentioned: but this for certain, all the time
that the Prince was studying with what truth to unfold this dark Enigma,
Desire flew in a robe of glowing blushes into her cheeks, and love enforced
her to deliver thus much from her own tongue, that he was sole sovereign of
all her wishes, and he the gentleman (of all her eyes had ever yet beheld) to
whom she wished a thriuing happiness. By which time the Prince having fully
considered upon what he had read, and found the meaning, both of the secret,
and their abominable sins, Antiochus rising up, demanded the solution of his
Question, or to attend the sentence of his death. But the gentle Prince wisely
foreknowing, that it is as dangerous to play with tyrants evils, as the Fly
to sport with the Candles flame, rather seemed to dissemble what he knew, than
to discover his insight to Antiochus knowledge, yet so circumspectly, that
Antiochus suspected, or at least, his own known guilf made him so suspect,
that he had found the meaning of his foul desire, and their more foul
actions; and seeming (as it were) then to pity him whom now in soul he hated,
and that he rather required his future happiness, than any blemish to his
present fortunes, he told him, that for the honor of his name, the nobleness
of his worth, nay his own dear and present love to him (were it not against
the dignity and state of his own love) in his tender and princely disposition,
he could from the whole world select him as a choice husband for his daughter,
since he found him so far wide from revealing of the secret; yet thus far
he should perceive his love should extend toward him, which before time had
not been seen to stretch it self to any of those decayed princes, of whose
falls, his eyes were careful witnesses, that for forty days he gave him only
longer respite, if by which time (and with all the endeavors, counsel and
advise he could use) he can find out what was yet concealed from him, it
should be evident how gladly he would rejoice to joy in such a son, rather
than have cause of sorrow by his untimely ruin: And in the mean time, in his
own Court, by the royalty of his entertainment he should perceive his
welcome. With which, and other such like gratulations their presences being
divided, Antiochus betook himself to his Chamber, and princely Pericles to
diligent consultations of his present estate, where when he had a while
considered with himself, that what he had fou^nd, was true, and this
substantially was the true meaning of his Riddle, he was become both father,
son, and husband by his uncomely and abhorred actions with his own child,
and she a deuourer of her mothers flesh, by the unlawful couplings with her
own father, and the defiling of her mothers bed, and that this courtesy of
Antiochus toward him, was but his hypocrisy, to have his sin concealed, till
he found fit occasion to take fit revenge (by the instruments of tyrants,)
poison, treason, or by any means, he resolved himself with all expedition,
(the next darkness being his best conductor,) to fly back to Tire, which he
effecting, and Antiochus being now private in his loeging, and ruminating with
himself, that Pericles had found out the secret of his evil, which he in
more secret had committed; and knowing, that he had no power to rip him open to
the world, and make his name so odious, that as now heaven did, so at the
knowledge thereof all good men would contemn him. And in this study, not
knowing how otherwise to help himself from this reproof, he hastily calls
for one Thalyart, who was Steward of his household, and in many things before
had received the imbracement of his mind; this Thalyart, (as Pericles
forethought,) he presently bribde with gold, and furthered with poison, to be
this harmles gentleman's executioner. To which purpose, as he was about to
receive his oath, there came hastily a Messenger that brought him news, the
Tyrian ships were that night departed his harbor, and that by intelligence
he had learned the Prince also was fled for Tire: at whose escape Antiochus
storming, but not desisting from his former practice, he commanded his
murdering minister Thalyart, to dispatch his best performance after him,
sometime persuading him, at others threatening him, in Tire to see him, in Tire
to kill him, or back to Antioch never to return, which villainous mind of his
as ready to yield, as the tyrant was to command. Thahart in all secrecy is
shipped from Antioch, while Pericles in this interim is arrived at Tire, where,
knowing what was past, and fearing what might succeed, not to himself, but for
the care he had of his subjects, remembering his power, too weak if occasion
were offered, to contend with the greatness of Antiochus: he was so troubled in
mind, that no advise of counsel could persuade him, no delights of the eye
content him, neither any pleasure whatsoever comfort him, but still taking to
heart, that should Antiochus make war upon him, as fearing lest he should
speak his shame which he intended not to reveal, his misfortune should be the
ruins of his harmless people.

In this sorrow, consisting one Helycanus a grave and wise Counselor, of his
(as a good Prince is ever known by his prudent Couusell) as much grieved in
mind for his Princes distemperature, as his Prince was troubled with the fear
of his subjects mishap, came hastily into the chamber to him, and finding him
so distasting mirth, that he abandoned all familiar society, he boldly began
to reprove him, and not sparingly to^ld him, he did not well so to abuse
himself, to waste his body there with pyning sorrow, upon whose safety
depended the lives and prosperity of a whole kingdom, that it was ill in him
to do it, and no less in his counsel to suffer him, without contradicting
it. At which, although the Prince bent his brow stearnely against him, he left
not to go forward, but plainly told him, it was as fit for him being a Prince
to hear of his own error, as it was lawful for his authority to command,
that while he lived so shut up, so unseen, so careless of his government,
order might be disorder for all him, and what detriment soever his subjects
should receive by this his neglect, it were injustice to be required at his
hands, which chiding of this good old Lord, the gentle Prince courteously
receiving, took him into his arms, thankt him that he was no flatterer, and
commanding him to seat himself by him, he from point to point related to him
all the occurrents past, and that his present sorrow was for the fear he had
of Antiochus tyranny, his present studies were for the good of his subjects,
his present care was for the continuing safety of his kingdom, of which
himself was a member, which for slacknesse chide him: which vprightnes of this
Prince calling tears into the old man's eyes, and compelling his knees to the
earth, he humbly asked his pardon, confirming that what he had spoke, sprung
from the power of his duty, and grew not from the nature of disobedience. When
Pericles no longer suffering such honored aged knees to stoop to his youth,
lifting him up, desired of him that his counsel now would teach him how to
avoid that danger, which his fear gave him cause to mistrust: which in this
manner was by the good Helicanus advised, and by princely Pericles. yielded
unto. That he should forth with betake himself to travel, keeping his intent
whither, as private from his subjects, as his journey was sudden, that upon
his trust he should leave the government, grounding which counsel upon this
principle, Absence abates that edge that Presence whets. In brief, Pericles
knew Helicanus trusty, and consented: so with store of corn and all
necessaries fit for a kingly voyage, he insecret has shipped himself from Tire.
Helycanus is protector of the kingdom in his absence: and our Story now has
brought us to the landing of Thaliart, with a body fraught as full of treason
against Pericles, as his master Antiochus was of tyranny, who no sooner a
shore, but he had his ears filled with the general lamentation of the Tyrian
people, the aged sighed, the youth wept, all mourned, helping one another how
to make up sorrow to the highest heap, as if with the absence of their Prince
they had lost their Prince, and with his loss they had present feeling of a
succeeding overthrow, which the vilaine understanding, and finding himself,
both berest of his purpose, and his master of his intent, he, as traitors do,
stole back to Antioch resolving Antiochus of what he knew: by which time, the
clamors of the multitude being for a time pacified by the wisdom of
Helicanus, and the peace of the common wealth by his prudence defended, our
princely Pericles with spread sails, fair winds, and full success, is now
arrived at Tharsus.

The third Chapter.
How Pericles arriving at Tharsus relieved the City, almost famished for want
of food, and how Helycanus sent him word of what had happened at Tire, with
his departure from Tharsus.

PRince Pericles by the advice of his good Counselor Helicanus, having left
Tire, and intended his whole course for Tharsus, of which City lord Cleon was
governor, who at this instance with Dyonysa his wife, were relating the present
miseries wherein themselves and their City Tharsus consisted: the ground of
which forced lamentation was, to see the power of change, that this their City,
who not two summers younger, did so excel in pomp, and bore a state, whom all
her neighbors envied for her greatness, to whom strangers resorted, as to the
school of variety, where they might best enrich their understandings with
experience, whose houses were like so many Courts for Kings, rather than
sleeping places for subjects, whose people were curious in their diet, rich in
attire, envious in looks, where was plenty in abundance, pride in fullness,
nothing in scarceness, but Charity and Love, the dignity of whose pallats
the whole riches of Nature could hardly satisfy, the ornaments of whose attire
Art it self with all invention could not content, are now so altered, that in
stead of dowlny beds, they make their pillowes on boords, in stead of full
furnished tables, hunger calls now out for so much bread, as may but satisfy
life: sacke-cloth is now their wearing instead of silk, tears instead of
enticing glaunces, are now the acquaintance of their eyes, in brief, riot has
here lost all her dominion, and now is no excess, but what is in sorrow, here
stands one weeping, and there lies another dying, so sharp are hungers teeth,
and so ravenous the devouring mouth of famine, that all pity is exiled
between the husband and the wife, nay all tenderness between the mother and
the children, faintness has now got that emperie over strength, there is none
so whole to relieve the sick, neither have the living sufficiency to give
burial to the dead. Thus while this Cleon Lord Governor of Tharsus, and
Dyonysa his Lady, with interchanging words were describing the sorrows which
their almost unpeopled City felt, who from the height of multiplication were
subtracted, almost to nothing: (for, what is life,) if it want sustenaunce? a
fainting messenger came slowely into them, his fearful looks described that
he brought sorrow, and in slow words he delivered this, that upon their
coasts there was discovered a fleet of ships making thitherward, which
Cleon supposing to be an army, which some neighbor nation (taking advantage of
their present mishap) had sent for their utter ouerthrows, he commanded the
bringer, upon their landing, to this purpose to salute their General, That
Tharsus was subdewed before their coming, and that it was small conquest to
subdew where there was no ability to resist, that they desired but this, that
their city might still stand, and that for the riches which their prosperity
had purchased, they freely resigned to them, they though their enemies, (for
humanities sake) in the place of breeding, would afford them burial. Pericles
by this is landed, and no sooner entered into their unshut gates, but his
princely eyes were partaking witnesses of their widowed desolation. The
messenger by this also has delivered the pleasure of the Governor, which the
Prince weeping to attend, who rather came to relieve than to ransacke, he
demanded of the fellow, where the Governor was, and forth with to be
conducted to him, which being effected, in the market place they met, where
Pericles without further hinderance delivered to him, that his thoughts were
deceued, to suppose them for enemies, who were now come to them for comfortable
friends, and those his ships which their fears might cause them to think were
fraughted with their destruction, were intreasured with corn for their
relief: at which the feeble souls not having strength enough to give a showte
for joy, gazing on him, and heaven, fell on their knees, and wept. But Pericles
going to the place of Judgment, causing all the living to be assembled
thither, thus freely delivered to them: You Citizens of Tharsus, whom penury
of victual pincheth at this present, Know you, that I Pericles Prince of Tire
am come purposely to relieve you, in respect of which benefit I doubt not but
you will be thus thankful as to conceal my arriving here, and for a while
to give me safe harborage, and hospitality for my ships and men, since by
the tyranny of Antiochus, though not driven, yet for a while I am desirous to
leave mine own Country, and continue my residence here with you, in
recompense of which love, I have brought with me a hundred thousand bushells of
wheat, which equally for your relief shall be distributed amongst you, each
man paying for every bushel eight pieces of brass, the price bestowed thereon
in my own Country. At which, as if the very name of bread only had power to
renew strength in them, they gave a great showt, offering their City to him as
his own, and their repaired strength in his defense: with which corn their
necessities being supplied, and every man willingly paying his eight pieces of
brass, as he had appointed, Pericles demanded for the Governor and the
chief men of the government, disdainining to be a Merchant to sell corn,
but out of his princely magnificence, bestowed the whole reuenew thereof to the
beautifying of their City. Which when the Citizens understood, to gratify
these large benefits, and to acknowledge him their patron and releeuer sent
them by the gods, they erected in the Market place a monument in the memorial
of him, and made his statue of brass, standing in a Chariot, holding corn in
his right hand, and spurning it with his left foot, and on the bases of the
pillar whereon it stood, was engraven in great Letters this inscription:
Pericles Prince of Tire gave a gift unto the City of Tharsus, whereby he
delivered it from cruel death. So a while we desire the Reader to leave
Pericles heartning up the decayed Citizens of Tharsus, and turn their eyes to
good Helycanus at Tire.

Good Helycanus as provident at home, as his Prince was prosperous abroad, let
no occasions^ip wherein he might send word to Tharsus of what occurrents
soever had happened in his absence, the chief of which was, that Thalyart by
Antiochus was sent, with purpose to mur^ther him, and that Antiochus, though
failing in his practice by his absence, seemed not yet to desist from like
intents, but that he again, suborned such like Instruments to the like
treason, aduising him withal for his more certain safety, for a while to
leave Tharsus, as a refuge too near the reach of the tyrant. To which Pericles
consenting, he takes his leave of his host Cleon and Dyonysa, and the
Citizens as sorry to leave him, as sorrow can be for the lack of comfort.

The fourth Chapter.
How Pericles puts forth to Sea, suffers ship wrecke, is relieved by certain
poor Fishermen, at last arriues at Simonides Court, king of Pentapolis, where
in feats of Arms he exceeds all the Princes that came to honor the birth
day of his fair daughter Thaysa, and with purpose also to sue to her for
marriage.

PKince Pericles having thus relieved Tharsus, and bin warnd (for the auoydance
of a greater danger) by his good Counselor Helycanus to forsake the City,
though not without much sorrow of the Citizens for his departure, he is once
again at sea, seekng anew ref uge, and accounting any country his best Inn,
where he found the best safety. No sooner were his wooden castles floating on
the unconstant deepes: but as if Neptune himself, chief sovereign of that
watery empire, would have come in person to have given calm gratulations, and
friendly welcomes to this courteous prince, the whole nation of the floods were
at quiet, there were no winds blustering, no surges rising, no raines
showring, no tempest storming, but all calmness was upon the face of this
kingdom, only a troop of cheerful Dolphins, as Ambassadors, sent from their
kingly Master, came dancing on the waters, for the entertaining of him. At
which, his joyful Mariners being scarce from sight of land, with pleasant
notes spread forth their comely sails, and with their brazen keeles, cut an
easy passage on the green meadows of the floods. At last, Fortune having
brought him here, where she might make him the fittest Tennis ball for her
sport: even as suddenly as thought this was the alteration, the Heavens
began to thunder, and the skies shone with falshes of fire: day now had no
other show but only name, for darkness was on the whole face of the waters,
hills of seas were about him, one sometimes tossing him even to the face of
heaven, while another sought to sincke him to the roof of hell, some cried,
others labored, he only prayed: at last, two ravenous billows meeting, the
one, with intent so stop up all clamor, and the other, to wash away all
labor, his vessels no longer able to wrestle with the tempest, were all
split. In brief, he was ship wrackt, his-good friends and subjects all were
lost, nothing left to help him but distress, and nothing to complain unto
but his misery. O calamity! there might you have heard the winds whistling,
the rain dashing, the sea roaring, the cables cracking, the tacklings
breaking, the ship tearing, the men miserably crying out to save their lives:
there might you have seen the sea searching the ship, the boordes fleeting,
the goods swimming, the treasure sincking, and the poor souls shifting to
save themselves, but all in vain, for partly by the violence of the tempest,
and partly through that dismal darkness, which unfortunately was come upon
them, they were all drowned, gentle Pericles only excepted, till (as it were
Fortune being tired with this mishap) by the help of a plancke, which in this
distress he got hold on, he was, with much labor, and more fear, driven
on the shore of Pentapolis, where a while complaining him of his mishaps, and
accosing the Gods of this injury done to his innocence, not knowing on what
shore, whether friend or foe he had, being certain Fishermen, who had also
suffered in the former tempest, and had been witnesses of his untimely
shipwreck: (the day being cleared again) were come out from their homely
cottages to dry and repair their nets, who being busted about their work,
and no whit regarding his lamentation, passed away their labor with discourse
to this purpose, in comparing the Sea to Brokers and Usurers* who seem fair,
and look lovely till they have got men into their clutches, when one tumbles
them, and an other tosses them, but seldom leaving until they have suncke
them. Again comparing our rich men to Whales, that make a great show in the
world, rolling and tumbling up and down, but are good for little, but to
sincke others: that the fishes live in the sea, as the powerful on shore, the
great ones eat up the little ones: with which moral observations driving out
their labor, and prince Pericles, wondering that from the finny subjects of the
sea these poor country people learned the infirmities of men, more than man's
obduracy and dulnes could learn one of another: at length ouercharged with
cold which the extremity of water had pressed him with, and no longer being
able to endure, he was compelled to demand their simple help, offering to
their ears the mishap of his shipwreck, which he was no sooner about to
relate, but they remembered their eyes, not without much sorrow, to have bin the
witnesses thereof: and beholding the comely feature of this Gentleman, the
chief of these fishermen was moved with compassion toward him, and lifting
him up from the ground, himself with the help of his men, led him to his
house, where with such fare as they presently had, or they could readily
provide, they with a hearty welcome feasted him, and the more to express their
tenderness to his misfortune, the master dishabited himself of his outward
apparel to warm and cherish him, which courteous Pericles as courteously
receiving, vowing, if ever his fortunes came to their ancient height, their
courtesies should not die vnrecompensed, and being somewhat repaired in heart by
their relief, he demanded of the country on the which he was driven, of the
name of the King, and of the manner of the government. When the master
Fisherman commanding his servants to go dragge up some other nets, which
yet were abroad, he seated himself by him, and of the question he demanded
to this purpose, resolved him; Our country here on the which you are driven
sir, is called Pentapolis, and our good king thereof is called Symonides: the
Good King call you him, quoth Pericles? Yea, and rightly so called sir, quoth
the poor Fisherman, who so gouernes his kingdom with justice and
uprightness, that he is no readier to command, than we his subjects are
willing to obey. He is a happy King, quoth Pericles, since he gains the name
of Good by his government, and then demanded how far his Court was distant
from that place: wherein he was resolved, some half a days journey, and from
point to point also informed, that the King had a princely daughter named
Thaysa, in whom was Beauty so joined with Virtue, that it was as yet
unresolved which of them deserved the greater comparison: and in memory of
whose birth day, her father yearly celebrated feasts and triumphs, in the
honor of which, many Princes and Knights from far and remote Countries came,
partly to approve their chiualry, but especially (being her fathers only
child,) in hope to gain her love: which name of Chiualry to approve, that all
the violence of the water had not power to quench the nobleness of his mind.
Pericles sighing to himself he broke out thus: Were but my fortunes
aunswerable to my desires some should feel that I would be one there. When as
if all the gods had given a plaudite to his words, the Fishermen, who before
were sent out by their Master to dragge out the other nets, having found
somewhat in the botome too ponderous for their strength to pull up, they began
to lewre and hallow to their Master for more help, crying that there was a
fish hung in their net, like a poor man's case in the Laws, it would hardly
come out, but Industry being a preuayling workman, before help came, up came
the Fish expected, but proved indeed to be a rusty armor. At the name of
which word Armor, Pericles being rowzed, he desired of the poor Fishermen,
that he who better than they, was acquainted with such furniture, might have
the view of it. In brief, what he could ask of them, was granted: the Armor
is by Pericles viewed, and known to be a defense which his father at his last
will gave him in charge to keep, that it might prove to be a defender of the
son, which he had known to be a preserver of the father: so accompting all
his other losses nothing, since he had that again, whereby his father could
not challenge him of disobedience: and thanking Fortune, that after all her
crosses, she had yet given him somewhat to repair his fortunes, begging this
Armor of the Fishermen, and telling them, that with it he would show the
virtue he had learned in Arms, and try his chiualry for their Princess
Thaysa, which they applauding, and one furnishing him with an old gown to make
Caparisons for his horse, which horse he provided with a Jewel, whom all the
raptures of the sea could not bereave from his arm, and other furnishing him
with the long side skirtes of their cassockes, to make him bases, his Armor
rusted: and thus disgracefully habilited, Prince Pericles with their conduct is
gone to the Court of Symonides, where the Fisher men had fore-tolde him was all
the preparation, that either Art or Industry might attain unto, to solemnize
the birth day of fair Thaysa the good King Symonides daughter. This is the
day, this Symonides Court, where the King himself, with the Princess his
daughter, have placed themselves in a Gallery, to behold the triumphs of
several Princes, who in honor of the Princes birth day, but more in hope to
have her love, came purposely thither, to approve their chivalry. They thus
seated, and Prince Pericles, as well as his own providing, and the Fishermens
care could furnish him, likewise came to the court. In this manner also 5.
several princes (their horses richly ^^parasoned, but themselves more richly
armed, their Pages before them bearing their Devices on their shields) entered
then the Tilting place. The first a prince of Macedon, and the Device he bore
upon his shield, was a black Ethiope reaching at the Sun, the word, Lux tua
vita mihi: which being by the knights Page delivered to the Lady, and from her
presented to the King her father, he made plain to her the meaning of each
imprese: and for this first, it was, that the Macedonian Prince loved her so
well he held his life of her. The second, a Prince of Corinth, and the Device
he bare upon his shield was a wreathe of Chiualry, the word, Me pompae
prouexet apex, the desire of renown drew him to this enterprise. The third of
Antioch, and his Device was an armed Knight, being conquered by a Lady, the
word, Pue p^r dolcera qui per sforsa: more by lenity than by force. The fourth
of Sparta, and the Device he bare was a man's arm environed with a cloud,
holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried, the word, Sic spectanda fides,
so faith is to be looked into. The fifth of Athens, and his Device was a flaming
Torch turned downward, the word, Qui me alit me extinguit, that which gives me
life gives me death. The fixed and last was Pericles Prince of Tire, who having
neither Page to deliver his shield, nor shield to deliver, making his Device
according to his fortunes, which was a withered Branch being only green at
the top, which proved the abating of his body, decayed not the nobleness of
his mind, his word, In hac spe viuo, In that hope I live. Himself with a most
graceful courtesy presented it unto her, which she as courteously received,
whilst the Peers attending on the King forbear not to scoff, both at his
presence, and the present he brought, being himself in a rusty Armor, the
Caparison of his horse of plain country russet, and his own Bases but the
skirtes of a poor Fishermans coat, which the King mildely reproouing them
for, he told them, that as Virtue was not to be approved by words, but by
actions, so the outward habit was the least table of the inward mind, and
counselling them not to condemn ere they had cause to accuse: They went
forward to the triumph, in which noble exercise they came almost all, as short
of Pericles perfections, as a body dying, of a life flourishing. To be short,
both of Court and Commons, the praises of none were spoken of, but of the mean
Knights (for by any other name he was yet unknown to any.) But the Triumphs
being ended, Pericles as chief, (for in this days honor he was Champion)
with all the other Princes, were by the Kings Marshall conducted into the
Presence, where Symonides and his daughter Thaysa, with a most stately banquet
stayed to give them a thankful intertainment. At whose entrance, the Lady
first saluting Pericles, gave him a wreathe of Chiualry, welcomed him as her
knight and guest, and crowned him King of that days noble enterprise. In the
end, all being seated by the Marshall at a table, placed directly ouer-against
where the king and his daughter sat as it were by some divine operation, both
King and daughter, at one instant were so struck in love with the nobleness
of his worth, that they could not spare so much time to satisfy themselves
with the delicacie of their viands, for talking of his praises: while Pericles
on the other side observing the dignity wherein the King sat, that so many
Princes came to honor him, so many Peers stood ready to attend him, he was
struck with present sorrow, by remembering the loss of his own. Which the
good Symonides taking note of, and accusing himself before there was cause,
that Pericles spirits were dumpt into their melancholy, through some dislike
of the slackenesse he found in his entertainment, or neglect of his worth,
calling for a boule of wine, he drank to him, and so much further honored
him, that he made his daughter rise from her seat to bear it to him, and
withal, willing her to demand of him his name, Country, and fortunes, a
message (gentle Lady) she was as ready to obey unto, as her Father was to
command, rejoicing that she had any occasion offered her whereby she might
speak unto him. Pericles by this time has pledged the King, and by his
daughter (according to his request) thus returns what he is, that he was a
Gentleman of Tire, his name Pericles, his education been in Arts and Arms,
who looking for adventures in the world, was by the rough and unconstant Seas,
most unfortunately bereft both of ships and men, and after shipwrecke,
thrown upon that shore. Which mis-haps of his the king understanding of, he
was struck with present pity to him, and rising from his state, he came
forth with and embraced him, bade him be cheered, and told him, that
whatsoever misfortune had impaired him of, Fortune, by his help, could repair
to him, for both himself and Country should be his friends, and presently
calling for a goodly milk white Steed, and a pair of golden spurs, them
first he bestowed upon him, telling him, they were the prises due to his
merit, and ordained for that days enterprise: which kingly courtesy Pericles
as thankefully accepting. Much time being spent in dancing and other reuells,
the night being grown old, the King commanded the Knights should be
conducted to their lodgings, giving order, that Pericles Chamber should be next
his own, where we will leave them to take quiet rest, and return back to
Tire.

The fifth Chapter.
How Helicanus heard news of Antiochus and his daughters deaths, and of his
sending of other Lords in search of their Prince Pericles.

ANtiochus, who as before is discoursed, having committed with his own
daughter so foul a sin, shamed not in the same foulness to remain in it
with her, neither had she that touch of grace, by repentance to constrain
him to abstinence, or by persuasion to deny his continuance: long, like those
miserable serpents did their greatness flourish, who use fairest shows for
fowlest evils, till one day himself seated with her in a Chariot, made of
the purest gold, attended by his peers, and gased on by his people, both
apparrelled all in Jewels, to out face suspicion, and beget wonder (as if that
glorious outsides were a wall could keep heavens eye from knowing our intents)
in great magnificence rode they through Antioch: But see the Justice of the
Highest, though sin flatter, and man persevere, yet surely Heaven at length
does punish. For as thus they rode, gazing to be gazed upon, and proud to be
accounted so, Uengeance with a deadly arrow drawn from forth the quiver of
his wrath, prepared by lightning, and shot on by thunder, hitte, and struck
dead these proud incestuous creatures where they sat, leaving their faces
blasted, and their bodies such a contemptfull object on the earth, that all
those eyes, but now with reverence looked upon them, all hands that served
them, and all knees adored them, scorned now to touch them, loathd now to look
upon them, and disdained now to give them burial. Nay, such is heavens hate to
these and such like sins, and such his indignation to his present evil, that
twixt his stroke and death, he lent not so much mercy to their lives, wherein
they had time to cry out; Justice, be merciful, for we repent us. They thus
dead, thus contemned, and insteede of kingly monument for their bodies left, to
be intoombed in the bow^l^es of ravenous fowls, if fowls would eat on them.
The strangeness of their deaths were soon rumored over that part of the
world, and as soon brought to the ears of Helycanus, who was a careful
watchman to have knowledge of whatsoever happened in Antioch, and by his
knowledge to prevent what danger might succeed, either to his Prince, or to
his subjects in his absence, of which tragedy he having notice, presently he
imparted the news thereof to his grave and familiar friend Lord Eschines, and
now told him what till now he had concealed, namely of their incest together,
and that only for the displeasure which princely Pericles feared Antiochus
bore toward him, and might extend to his people, by his knowledge thereof,
he thus long by his counsel had discontinued from his kingdom.

Now it happened that these tidings arrived to his ears, just at the instant,
when his grave counsel could no longer alay the headstrong multitude from
their uncivil and giddy muteny: and the reason of them (who most commonly are
unreasonable in their actions) to draw themselves to this faction, was, that
they supposed their prince was dead, and that being dead, the kingdom was left
without a successful inheritor, that they had bin only by Helicanus with
vain hope of Pericles return, deluded, and that even now the power being, by
his death, in their hands, they would create to themselves a new sovereign,
and Helycanus should be the man. Many reasons he used to persuade them, many
Arguments to withstand them: nothing but this only prevailed with them, that
since he only knew their Prince was gone to travel, and that, that travel was
undertaken for their good, they would abstain but for three months longer from
bestowing that dignity which they called their love, though it was his dislike
upon him, and if by that time (which they with him should still hope for) the
gods were not pleased for their perpetual good to restore unto them their
absent Prince, he then with all willingness would accept of their suffrages.
This then (though with much trouble) was at last by the whole multitude
accepted, and for that time they were all pacified, when Helicanus assembling
all the peers unto him, by the advice of all, chose some from the rest, and
after his best instructions, or rather by persuasions and grave counsel given,
he sent them to inquire of their Prince, who lately left at Pentapolis was
highly honored by good Symonides.

The sixth Chapter.
How Prince Pericles is married to Thaysa king Symonides daughter, and how
after he has heard news of Antiochus death, he with his wife departs
toward his own Country of Tire.

PRince Pericles having had (as before is mentioned) his lodging directed next
adjoining to the kings bedchamber, whereas all the other Princes upon their
coming to their lodgings betook themselves to their pillowes, and to the
nourishment of a quiet sleep, he of the Gentlemen that attended him, (for it
is to be noted, that upon the grace that the king had bestowed on him, there
was of his Officers toward him no attendance wanting) he desired that he
might be left private, only that for his instant solace they would pleasure
him with some delightful Instrument, with which, and his former practice he
intended to pass away the tediousness of the night insteade of more fitting
slumbers. His will was presently obeyed in all things since their master had
commanded he should be disobeyed in nothing: the Instrument is brought him,
and as he had formerly wished, the Chamber is disfurnished of any other
company but himself, where presently he began to compel such heavenly
voices from the senseless workmanship, as if Apollo himself had now been
fingering on it, and as if the whole Sinode of the gods, had placed their
deities round about him of purpose, to have been delighted with his skill, and
to have given praises to the excellency of his art, nor was this sound only
the rauisher of al hearers, but from his own clear breast he sent such
cheerful notes, which by him were made up so answerable to the others sound,
that they seemed one only consort of music, and had so much delicacie, and
out of discordes making up so excellent a conjunction, that they had had power
to have drawn back an ear, half way within the grave to have listened unto
it, for thus much by our story we are certain of, that the good Symonides
(being by the height of night, and the former days exercise, in the ripeness
of his contentfull sleep) he rejoiced to be awakend by it, and not accompting
it a disease that troubled him in the hearing, but a pleasure wherewith he
still wished to be delighted. In brief, he was so satisfied to hear him thus
express his excellence, that he accounted his Court happy to entertain so
worthy a guest, and himself more happy in his acquaintance. But day that has
still that sovereignty to draw back the empire of the night, though a while
she in darkness usurp, brought the morning on, and while the king was
studying with what aunswerable present, wherewith to gratify this noble Prince
for his last nights music, a Gentlewoman (whose service was thither
commanded by his Daughter) brought him a Letter, whose inside had a suit to
him to this purpose.

The Lady Thaysaes Letter to the King her Father.
MY most noble Father, what my blushing modesty forbids me to speak, let your
fatherly love excuse that I write, I am subdude by love, yet not inthralld
through the licentiousnes of a loose desire, but made prisoner in that noble
battle twixt Affection and Zeal: I have no life but in this liberty, neither
any liberty but in this thraldom, nor shall your tender self, weighing my
affections truly in the Scale of your Judgment, have cause to contradict me,
since him I love has as much merit in him, to challenge the title of a Son,
as I blood of yours to inherit the name of a daughter, then if you shall
refuse to give him me in marriage, deny not I pray you to make ready for my
funeral.

It Is the stranger Pericles.

Which request of hers, when the king her father had thus understood of, he
began first to examine with him self, what virtue was in this choice, that
should bind her thoughts to this liking, and what succeeding comfort he might
expect, the expectation of which, might inuit him to his consent. First he
began to remember himself, that he came unto his Court but poor, and for
poverty, quoth the good king, it is a woorkemanship, that Nature makes up even
for others to contemn, and, which in these times, is grown odious to keep
company withal, that to marry her which was his only child, and the
expectation of his subjects, with one of so low blood and mean descent,
would return, rather a dishonor than a dignity to his name, since Parents
rather expect the advancement of Titles, and the raising of their houses, in
the uniting of their issue, than the declining: but in the end, when he had
put all the Interiections he could between her love and his liking, his
uprightness made him see, that in virtue consisted man's only perfection, and
in him, as her be fitting Court, she thought it fittest to keep her royal
residence, and in that opinion allowing of his daughters choice, he thought
himself happy to live Father to such a virtuous son, and his daughter more
happy to be coupled to so noble a husband. And as he was now thus contracting
them together in his rejoicing thoughts, even in the instant came in Pericles,
to give his Grace that salutation which the morning required of him, when the
king intending to dissemble that in show, which he had determined on in heart,
he first told him, that his daughter had that morning sent unto him that
Letter, wherein she entreated of him, that his Grace would be pleased, that
himself (whom she knew to call by no other name but the Stranger Pericles)
might become her Schoolemaister, of whose rariety in music, excellency in
song, with comeliness in dancing, not only she had heard, but himself had
borne testimony to be the best, that ever their judgments had had cause to
judge of. When Pericles, though willing to yield any courtesies to so gracious
a Lady, and not disdaining to be commanded any services by so good a Lord, yet
replied, Though all his abilities were at his Graces pleasure, yet he thought
himself unworthy to be his daughters schoolemaister. I but quoth Symonides,
she will not be denied to be your Scholar, and for manifest proof thereof
here is her own Character, which to that purpose she has sent unto us, and
we to that purpose give you leave to read: which Pericles ouerlooking, and
finding the whole tenor thereof to be, that his daughter from all the other
Princes, nay from the whole world, solicited him for her husband* he
straitway rather coniectured it to be some subtlety of the father to betray
his life, than any constancy of the princess to love him: and forthwith
prostrating himself at the kings feet, he desired that his Grace would no
way seek to stain the nobleness of his mind, by any way seeking to intrappe
the life of so harmless ^ Gentleman, or that with evil he would conclude so
much good which he already had begun toward him, protesting, that for his
part, his thoughts had never that ambition, so much as to aim at the love of
his daughter, nor any action of his, gave cause of his princely displesure: but
the king faining still an angry brow, turned toward him, and told him, that
like a traitor, he lied. Traitor, quoth Pericles? I, traitor, quoth the
king, that thus disguised, art stolen into my Court, with the witchcraft ^^ thy
actions to bewitch, the yielding spirit of my tender Child. Which name of
Traitor being again (...) which Pericles then, insteade of humbleness seemed
not to forget his ancient courage, but boldly replied, That were it any in
his Court, except himself, durst call him traitor, even in his bosom he would
write the lie: affirming, that he came into his Court in search of honor, and
not to be a rebel to his State, his blood was yet untainted, but with the
heat, got by the wrong the king had offered him, and that he boldly durst, and
did defy, himself, his subjects, and the prowdest danger, that either
tyranny or treason could inflict upon him. Which nobleness of his, the king
inwardly commending, though otherwise dissembling, he answered, he should
prove it otherwise, since by his daughters hand, if there was evident, both
his practice and her consent therein. Which words were no sooner uttered, but
Thaysa (who ever since she sent her Father her Letter, could not contain her
self in any quiet, till she heard of his answer) came now in, as it had been
her part, to make answer to her Fathers last syllable, when prince Pericles
yielding his body toward her, in most courteous manner demanded of her by the
hope she had of heaven, or the desire she had to have her best wishes fulfilled
here in the world, that she would now satisfy, her now displeased Father,
if ever he, by motion, or by letters, by amorons glaunces, or by any means
that Lovers use to compass their disseignes, had sought to be a friend in the
nobleness of her thoughts, or a copartner in the worthiness of her love, when
she as constant to finish, as she was forward to attempt, again required of
him, that suppose he had, who durst take offense thereat, since that it was her
pleasure to give him to know that he had power to desire no more than she had
willingness to perform? How minion, quoth her Father (taking her off at the
very word, who dare be displeased withal?) Is this a fit match for you? a
straggling Theseus borne we know not where, one that has neither blood nor
merit for thee to hope for, or himself to challenge even the least allowaunce
of thy perfections, when she humbling her princely knees before her Father,
besought him to consider, that suppose his birth were base (when his life
showed him not to be so) yet he had virtue, which is the very ground of all
nobility, enough to make him noble: she entreated him to remember that she was
in love, the power of which love was not to be confined by the power of his
will. And my most royal Father, quoth she, what with my pen I have in
secret written unto you, with my tongue now I openly confirm, which is, that I
have no life but in his love, neither any being but in the enjoying of his
worth. But daughter (quoth Symonides) equalles to equals, good to good is
joined, this not being so, the bauine of your mind in rashness kindled, must
again be quenched, or purchase our displeasure. And for you sir (speaking to
prince Pericles) first learn to know, I banish you my Court, and yet scorning
that our kingly inragement should stoop so low, for that your ambition sir,
I Will have your life. Be constant, quoth Thaysa, for every drop of blood he
sheades of yours, he shall draw an other from his only child. In brief, the
king continued still his rage, the Lady her constancy. While Pericles stood
amazed at both, till at last the Father being no longer able to subdue that
which he desired as much as she, catching them both rashly by the hands, as
if he meant strait to have enforced them to imprisonment heclapt them hand in
hand, while they as lovingly joined lip to lip, and with tears trickling from
his aged eyes, adopted him his happy son, and bade them live together as man
and wife. What joy there was at this coupling, those that are Lovers and enjoy
their wishes, can better conceive, than my pen can set down; the one rejoicing
to be made happy by so good and gentle a Lord, the other as happy to be
enriched by so virtuous a Lady. What preparation there was for their marriage,
is sufficiently expressed in this, that she was the only daughter to a king,
and had her fathers liking in her love: what speed there was to that marriage,
let those judge who have the thoughts of Thaysa at this instant, only conceive
the solempnities at the Temple are done, the feast in most solemn order
finished, the day spent in music, dancing, singing, and all Courtly
communication, half of the night in maskes and other courtly shows, and the
other half in the happy and lawful imbracements of these most happy Lovers.
The discourse at large of the liberal Chalenges made and proclaimed, at Tilt,
Barriers, running at the King* ioco di can, mannaging fierce horses, running on
foot, and dancing in armours, of the stately presented Plays, Shows
disguised, Speeches, Maskes and Mummeries, with continual harmony of all
kinds of Music, with banqueting in all delicacie, I leave to the
consideration of them who have beheld the like in Courts, and at the wedding
of princes rather than afford them to the description of my pen, only let
such conceive, all things in due order were accomplished, the duties of
marriage performed: and fair Thaysa this night is conceived with child.

The next day Joy dwelling through the whole kingdom for this conjunction, every
man arose to feasting and iollity, for the wedding triumphs continued a whole
month, while Time with his feathered wings, sofanned away the hours, and with
his flippery feet, so glided over the days, that nine Moons had almost
changed their light, ere half the time was thought to be expired, when it
happened, that as the good Symonides and princely Pericles with his fair
Thaysa were walking in the garden adjoining to their palace, one of the Lords,
who (as before) were sent by grave and careful Helycanus, in search of their
absent Prince, came hastily in to them, who upon his knee delivered unto the
young Prince a Letter, which being opened the contents therein spoke thus unto
him: That Antiochus and his daughter (as is before described) were with the
violence of lightning (shot from heaven,) struck suddenly dead. And moreover,
that by she consent of the general doyces the City of Antioch, with all the
riches therein, and the whole kingdom were reserved for his possession and
princely government. Which Letter when he had read, he presently imparted the
news thereof to his kingly Father, who upon view received, he strait knew
(what until then the modesty of Pericles had concealed) that his son whom
from poverty he advanced to be the bedfellow of his daughter, was Prince of
Tire, who for the fear he had of Antiochus, had forsook his kingdom, and now
had given unto him the kingdom of Antiochus for recompense, that grave
Helycanus had not without much labor, appeased the stubborn mutiny of the
Tyrians, who in his absence would have elected him their king, and that to
avoid a future insurrection, his whole state) in safety, how necessary it was
for him to make a speedy return, which gladness Symonides im^^cted to his
Daughter, who as gladly received them. While Pericles intending a while to
leave his dearest dear behind him, considering how dangerous it was for her
to travel by sea, being with child, and so near her time, he began to
entreat of his kingly father of all necessary provision for his departure,
since the safety of two kingdoms did importune so much: when on the other
side Thaysa falling at her fathers feet, her tears speaking in her suit
faster than her words, she humbly requested, that as his reverend age
tendered her, or the prosperity of the Infant wherewith she thought her self
happy to be imburthened, he would not permit her to remain behind him.
Which tears of hers preuayling with the aged King, though compelling his
tears to take a loath and sorrowful departure of her. Their Ships being
strongly appointed, and fraught with all things convenient as gold, silver,
apparel, bedding, victuals, and armor, and fearing what too unfortunately
happened, causing an aged Nurse called Lycorida a Midwife, with other handmaides
to attend her. They are shipped, and he on shore, the one gasing after the
other with a greedy desire, until the high usurping waters took away the
sight from them both.

The seventh Chapter.
How fair Thaysa died in travel of childe-birth upon the Sea, and being
thrown for burial in the waters, was castashoare at Ephesus, and how by the
excellent labor of Lord Cerimon a skillful Physician, she was restored to her
life again, and by her own request placed to live a Votary in the Temple of
Diana.

PRince Pericles, with his Queen Thaysa, being thus on ship boorde, and
their mariners merrily having hoysed up their sails, their vessels, as
proud of such a fraught wherewith they were enriched, galloped cheerfully on
the Ocean. Fortune did now seem to look fairly, neither was there promise of
any other alteration, the day looked lovely, and the sea smiled for joy, to
have her bosom pressed with these burdens: But nothing in this world that is
permanent, Time is the father of Fortune, he is slippery, and then of
necessity must his child be fickle: and this was his alteration, a cloud
seemed to arise from forth the south, which being by the Master and Mariners
beheld, they told Prince Pericles, that it was messenger of of a storm, which
was no sooner spoken, but as if the heavens had conspired with the waters, and
the winds bin assistant to both, they kept such a blustering, and such an
unruly stir, that none could be heard to speak but themselves, seas of
waters were received into their ships while others fought against them to
expel them out, stop the lecage there cries out one, hale up the maine
bowlings there calls out another, and with their confusion (neither
understanding other, since the storm had got the maistery) they made such a
hideous noise, that it had had power to have awakened Death, and to have
affrighted Patience: nor could it choose then but bring much terror to our
sea-sicke Queen, who had been used to better attendance, than was now offered
her by these ill tutored servants Wind and Water: but they who neither
respect birth nor blood, prayers nor threats, time nor occasion, continued
still their boisterous havoc. With which stir (good Lady) her eyes and
ears having not till then bin acquainted, she is struck into such a hasty
fright, that welladay she falls in travel, is delivered of a daughter, and in
this child birth dies, while her princely husband being above the hatthes, is
one while praying to heaven for her safe deliverance, an other while suffering
for the sorrow wherewith he knew his Queen was imburthened, he chid the contrary
storm (as if it had been sensible of hearing) to be so unmannerly, in this
unfitting season, and when so good a Queen was in labor, to keep such a
blustering: thus while the good Prince remained reproouing the one, and
pitying the other, up comes Lycorida the Nurse, sent along by good Symonides
with his daughter, and into his arms delivers his Sea-borne Babe, which he
taking to kiss, and pitying it with these words: Poor inch of Nature (quoth
he) thou art as rudely welcome to the world, as ever Princess Babe was, and
have as chiding a nativity, as fire, air, earth, and water can afford thee,
when, as if he had forgot himself, he abruptly breaks out: but say Licorida
how does my Queen? O sir (quoth she) she has now passed all dangers, and
has given up her griefs by ending her life. At which words, no tongue is
able to express the tide of sorrow that ouer-bounded Pericles, first looking
on his Babe, and then crying out for the mother, pitying the one that had lost
her bringer ere she had scarce saluted the world, lamenting for himself that
had been bereft of so inestimable a Jewel by the loss of his wife, in which
sorrow as he would have proceeded, up came the Master to him, who for that
the storm continued still in his tempestuous height, brake off his sorrow
with these sillables. Sir, the necessity of the time affoordes no delay, and
we must entreat you to be contented, to have the dead body of your Queen
thrown ouer-boorde. How varlet! quoth Pericles, interrupting him, would
thou have me cast that body into the sea for burial, who being in misery
received me into favor? We must entreat you to temperance sir (quoth the
Master) as you respect your own safety, or the prosperity of that pretty Babe
in your arms. At the naming of which word Babe. Pericles looking mournfully
upon it, shook his head, and wept. But the Master going on, told him, that
by long experience they had tried, that a ship may not abide to carry a dead
carcass, nor would the lingering tempest cease while the dead body remained
with them. But the Prince seeking again to persuade them, told them, that it
was but the fondnes of their superstition to think so. Call it by what you
shall please sir (quoth the Master) but we that by long practice have tried the
proof of it, if not with your grant, then without your consent (for your own
safety, which we with all duty tender) must so dispose of it. So calling for
his servants about him, he willed one of them, to bring him a chest, which he
forthwith caused to be well bitumed and well leaded for her coffin, then
taking up the body of his (even in death) fair Thaysa, he arrayed her in
princely apparel, placing a Crown of gold upon her head, with his own
hands, (not without store of funeral tears) he laid her in that Toombe, then
placed^ he also store of gold at her head, and great treasure of silver at
her feet, and having written this Letter which he laid upon her breast, with
fresh water flowing in his eyes, as loath to leave her sight, he nailed up the
Chest, the Tenor of which writing was in form as follows;

If ere it hap this Chest be driven
On any shore, on coast or haven,
I Pericles the Prince of Tire,
(That loosing her, lost all desire,)
Entreat you give her burying,
Since she was daughter to a King:
This gold I give you as a fee,
The Gods requite your charity.
The Chest then being nailed up close, he commanded it to be lifted
ouer-boorde, and then naming his Child Marina, for that she was borne upon
the Sea, he directed his Master to alter the course from Tire, (being a
shorter cut to Tharsus) and for whose safety he thither intended, where with
his host Cleon and Dionysa his wife, he intended to leave his little infant,
to be fostered and brought up. The dead body being thus thrown ouerboorde,
when as if Fortune had bethought her, that she had wrought her utmost spite
to him, by bereauing him of so great a comfort, even in the instant the tempest
cease, where we will leave Prince Pericles upon calm waters, though not
with a calm wind, sailing to Tharsus: and behold, the next morning, by which
time, the waves had rouled, from wave to wave this Chest to land, and cast it
ashoare on the coast of Ephesus, in which City lived a Lord called Cerimon,
who, though of noble blood, and great possessions, yet was he so addicted to
study, and in searching out the excellency of Arts, that his felicity
consisted in contemplation, wisely fore-knowing, so icie is the state of
riches, that it is thawed to nothing, by the least adversity, that careless
heirs may dispend, and riot consume them, when one virtue, and our deserved
fame attends immortality, this consideration made him so to apply his time in
Letters, and in searching out the nature of Simples, that he grew so excellent
in the secret of Physic, as if Apollo himself, or another Aesculapius had
been his Schoolemaister: nor was he of this plenty a niggard to the needy,
but so bountiful to the distressed, that his house and hand were accounted the
hospitalls for the diseased. This Lord Cerimon had his residence built so near
the shore, that in his windows he ouer-looked the Sea: and being this morning
in conference with some that came to him both for help for themselves, and
relief for others; and some that were relating the cruelty of the last nights
tempest on a sudden casting his eye from forth his casement toward the
maine, he might epsy the waters, as it were, playing with the Chest wherein
the dead Queen was incoffind, and which was upon the sudden, by a more eager
billow, cast on his banks, when presently thinking it to be the remnant of
some shippewracke, caused in the last nights storm, calling for his servants,
he forthwith commanded them to have it brought up to him as forseited unto
him, being cast on his ground, which accordingly performed, he as presently
gave charge it should be opened, when not without much wonder he straitway
viewed the dead body of the Queen, so crowned, so royally apparelled, so
intreasured as before, and taking up the writing which he likewise found placed
upon her breast, he read it to the Gentlemen, who at that time accompanied
him, and knowing it thereby to be the dead Queen to Prince Pericles. Now
surely, quoth Pericles, thou have a body even drowned with woe for the loss
of so goodly a creature: for Gentlemen, said he, as you may perceive, such was
the excellency of her beauty, that grimme Death himself has not power to
suffer any deformity to accompany it. Then laying his hand gently upon her
cheek, he bethought him that life had not lost all the workemanshippe that
Nature had bestowed upon her, for even at the opening of the Chest, and as it
were she then receiving fresh air, he might perceue, a new but calm glowing to
recspire in her cheeks, with which being somewhat amazed. Now surely Gentlemen,
quoth he turning to them, who were greedily set round about him, this Queen
has not long been intraunced, and I have read of some Egyptians, who after
four hours death, (if man may call it so) have raised impouerished bodies,
like to this, unto their former health, nor can it be disparagement to me to
use my best practice on this Queen, to which by the Gentlemen that accompanied
him, he was encouraged to attempt, since that the recovery of her could not
but appear to be a work of wonder, and since that his fortune was so
successful in his ministering, that all Fphesus was repleate with his help,
so calling for a servant of his to attend him with certain boxes which he
named were in his study, as also with fire and necessary linen, inuoking
Apollo to be gracious to his empericke, and the work in hand, he began to
apply to her, First pulling down the clothes from off the Ladies bosom, he
powered upon her a most precious ointment, and bestowing it abroad with his
hand, perceived some warmth in her breast, and that there was life in the body,
whereat somewhat astonished, he felt her pulses, laid his cheek to her mouth,
and examining all other tokens that he could devise, he perceived how death
strove with life within her, and that the conflict was dangerous, and doubtful
who should prevail. Which being done, he chased the body against the fire,
until the blood which was congealed with cold was wholly dissolved, when
pouring a precious liquor into her mouth, he perceived warmth more and more to
increase in her, and the golden fringes of her eyes alitle to part: then
calling softly to the Gentlemen who were witnesses about him, he bade them that
they should command some still music to found. For certainly quoth he, I
think this Queen will live, and suppose that she has bin much abused, for
she has not been long intraunced, condemning them for rashness so hassily to
throw her over boorde. And when he had so said, he took the body reverently
into his arms, and bare it into his own Chamber, and laid it upon his bed
groueling upon the breast, then took he certain hot and comfortable oiles,
and warming them upon the coals, he dipped fair wool therein, and fomented
all the body over therewith, until such time as the congealed blood and
humors were thoroughly resolved, and the spirits in due form recovered their
woonted course, the veins waxed warm, the arteries began to beat, and the
lungs drew in the fresh air again, and being perfectly come to her self,
lifting up those now again pricelesse diamonds of her eyes, O Lord (quoth
she) where am I? for it seems to me that I have been in a strange Country.
And where is my Lord I pray you? I long to speak with him. But Cerimon, who best
knew, that now with any thing to discomfort her, might breed a relapse, which
would be unrecoverable, entreated her to be cheered, for her Lord was well, and
that anon, when the time was more fitting, and that her decayed spirits were
repaired, he would gladly speak with her: So, as it were, being but newly
awaked from death, to the great amasement of the beholders, she presently tell
into a most comfortable slumber, which Lord Cerimon giving charge none should
disturb her of, he in the mean time, and against she should awake, provided
cherishing meats, and as her strength grew, gave wholesome clothes to refresh
her with. But not long after, weakness being banished from her, and Cerimon,
by communication knew, that she came of the stock of a King, he sent for many
of his friends to come unto him, and adopted her for his own daughter, and
related unto her, how after so grievous a tempest, in what manner she was
found. In which tempest she supposing her kingly husband to be shipwrecked,
she with many tears entreated, that since he had given her life, he would be
pleased to give her lea^s to live unknown to any man. To which Cerimon
accorded: and for that intent placed her in the Temple of Diana, which was
there consecrated at Ephesus.

The eight Chapter.
How Pericles arriving at Tharsus, delivers his young daughter Marina unto
Cleon and Dyonysa to be fostered up: and how Lycorida the Nurse lying upon her
deathbed, declares unto Marina who were her parents.

Having thus left the recovered Thaysa amongst the holy Nuns in the Temple of
Diana at Ephesus, our Story bids us look back unto sorrowful Pericles,
whose ship with fortunate wind, favor of the heavens, and providence of his
pylate, arrived at the shore of Tharsus, where upon his landing he was
courteously received by Cleon and Dyonysa; whom he as courteously saluted,
telling them the heavy chances which had befallen him, both of the great
storms and tempests on the Sea, which he with patience had endured, as also of
the death of the good Lady Thaysa, which he not without much sorrow suffered,
only quoth he, I have here left a little picture of her, who for it was given
unto me at Sea, I have named Marina, and I thank the heavens, is so like unto
her, that I never do look upon it, but with much comfort, in whose
protection and education I mean to use your friendship, while I go on in
travel to receive the kingdom of Antiochus, which is reserved for me. And if
you will ever show your gratitude, for my former charity extended toward
you, and all this City in a former distress, the gods have given this cause,
to prove your thankfulness. When both vowing by solemn oath, their care
should be on her, as reason unto themselves, who is the guider of man's life: he
satisfied with that their promise, thanked them, telling them moreover, that
with them also he would leave Lycorida her mothers nurse, (and given unto him
by her good father Symomdes) that she might be a nurse unto her child, only
further requesting them, and so charging Lycorida, that if it pleased the gods
to lend her life to the years of understanding, they should not till his
return, make known unto her, that she was a branch sproong from him, but
only be brought up as the daughter of Cleon and Dyonysa, lest that the
knowledge of her high birth, should make her grow proud to their instructions.
Of which having likewise promise, he delivered the infant and the nurse to
Cleon, and therewithal, great sums of gold, silver, and apparel, and vowing
solemnly by oath to himself, his head should grow vncisserd, his beard
untrimmed, himself in all uncomely, since he had lost his Queen, and till he
had married his daughter at ripe years. When they much wondering at so strange a
resolve, and promising to be most faithful with all diligence according to his
directions, Pericles took his leave, departed with his Ship, sailing even to
the uttermost parts of all Egypt, while his young daughter Marina grew up to
more able discretion, and when she was fully attaind to 5. years of age, being
to her self known no other but to be free borne, she was set to School with
other free children, always jointly accompanied with one only daughter that
Dionysa had, being of the same time that she was of, where growing up, as well in
learning, as in number of years, until she came to the reckoning of
fourteen, one day when she returned from School, she found Lycorida her
Nurse suddenly fallen sick, and sitting beside her upon the bed, she as in
care of her, demanded the cause and manner of her sickness: when the Nurse
finding her disease to have no hope of recovery, but a harbinger that came
before to prepare a lodging for death, answered her to this purpose; For my
sickness, queth she, it matters not (dear child) since it is as necessary
to be sick, as it is needful to die, only I entreat of you to hearken unto
a dying woman's words that loves you, and laying them up in your heart,
persuade yeur self, that in these heures no sinner should, or can be so
wretched, to spare a minute to find time to lie. Know then, that you are not
the daughter of Cleon and Dyonysa, as you till this have supposed: but hearken
unto me, and I will declare unto thee the beginning of thy birth, that thou
may know how to guide thy self after my death: Pericles the Prince of Tire
is thy father, and Thaysa king Symonides daughter was thy mother: which father
and mother departed from thy grandsir at Pentapolis toward their kingdom of
Tire, thy mother being at Sea, fell in travel with thee, and died after thou
were borne: when thy Father Pericles enclosed her body in a Chest with princely
ornaments, laying twenty talents of gold at her head, and as much at her feet
in silver; with a Scedule written, containing the dignity of her birth, and
manner of her death, then caused he the Chest to be thrown ouer-boorde into the
Sea, through a superstitious opinion which the mariners believed, leaving her
body so enriched, to the intent, that whither soever it were driven, they that
found it, in regard of the riches, would bury her according to her estate.
Thus Lady were you borne upon the waters, and your fathers Ship with much
wrestling of contrary winds, and with his unspeakable grief of mind,
arrived at this shore, and brought thee in thy swaddling clowtes unto this
City, where he with great care delivered thee unto this thine host Cleon and
Dyonysa his wife, diligently to be fosterad up, and left me here also to
attend upon thee, swearing this oath to keep inuiolate, his hair should be
vncisserd, his face untrimmed, himself in all things uncomely continually to
mourn for mother, your dead mother, until your ripe years gave him occasion
to marry you to some prince worthy your birth and beauty; wherefore I now
admonish you, that if after my death, thine host or hostess, whom thou calst
thy parents, shall happly offer thee any injury, or discurteously taking
advantage of thy absent father as unbefitting thine estate intertain thee,
haste thee into the market place, where thou shall find a Statue erected to
thy father standing, take hold of it, and cry aloude; You citizens of
Tharsus; I am his daughter whose Image this is, who being mindful of thy
fathers benefits will doubtless revenge thy injury. When Marina thanking
Lycorida for making that known to her, which till then was unknown, and happly
either through Time or Death might have been buried in her ignorance: and
vowing, if ever need should so require (of which as yet she had no cause to
doubt) her counsel should be followed. And so Lycorida through sickness
growing more weak, and Marina for this knowledge and advise still tending on
her, in her arms at last she gave up the Ghost.

The ninth Chapter.
How after the death of Lycorida the Nnurse Dyonysa envying at the beauty of
Marina, hired a servant of hers to have murderd her, and how she was rescued by
certain Pirates, and by them carried to the City of Meteline, where among
other bondslaues, she was sold to a common Bawd.

MArina having thus by Lycoridaes means had knowledge of her parents, and
Lycorida having been in her life, her most careful Nurse, she (not without
just cause) lamented her death, and caused her body to be solempnely interred,
in a field without the walls of the City, raising a monument in remembrance
of her, vowing to her self a years solemn sadness, and that her eyes also
for so long a time should daily pay their dewy offerings, as lamenting the
loss of so good a friend.

But this decree of hers being accomplished, and all the rites thereof
faithfully fulfilled, she dismissed her body of her mourning attire, and
again apparrelled her self as before, in her most costly habilliments,
frequenting the Schools, and diligently endeavoring the studies of the
Liberal Sciences, wherein she so out-went in perfection, the labors of all
that were studious with her, that she was rather used amongst them as their
Schoolemistris to instruct, than their fellow Scholar to learn, only for her
recreation betwixt the hours of study, dancing, singing, sowing, or what
experience soever (for in no action was she inexpert, as also every morning,
and at noone, before she made her meal) she forgotte not to reuisite her
Nurses sepulcher: and entering into the monument, upon her knees she there
offered her funeral tears for the loss of her mother, and desiring the gods
in their holy Synod to protect the safety of her father, accusing her self as
an unfortunate child, whose being, caused the death of her mother, so good a
Queen, and the sorrow of her father, so courteous a Prince: and in very deed,
the whole course of her life was so affable and courteous, that she won the
love of all and every man, accompting his tongue (the father of speech) a
trewant, which was not liberal in her praises: so that it fortuned as she
passed along the street, with Dyonysa her daughter, who was her companion and
Schoole-fellow, and who till then she supposed had been her sister. The
people, as at other times, came running out of their doors with greedy desire
to look upon her; and beholding the beauty and comeliness of Marina so far
to outshine Dyonysaes daughter, who went side by side with her, could not
contain themselves from crying out, Happy is that father who has Marina to
his daughter, but her Companion that goes with her is foul and illfauoured.
Which when Dyonysa heard, her envy of those prays bred in her a contempt, and
that contempt soon transformed it self into wrath, all which she for the
instant dissembling, yet at her coming home withdrawing her self into a
private walk, she in this manner with her self began to discourse; It is now
quoth she, fourteen years since Pericles this out-shining gerles father
departed this our City, in all which time we have not received so much as a
Letter, to signify that he remembers her, or or any other token, to manifest
he has a desire to acknowledge her, whereby I have reason to conjecture, that
he is either surely dead, or not regardes her, though I must confess, at his
departure from hence, and his committing her to our protection, he left her not
unfurnished of all things fitting the education of his child, and a princess
of her birth, both of gold, plate, and apparel, even competent enough to
foster her according to her degree, nay (if need were) to marry her according
to her blood. But what of all this? he is absent, and Lycorida her Nurse is
dead: She in beauty out-shines my child, and I have her fathers treasure in
possession, (though given for her use) shall make my daughter outshine her.
What though I know her father did relieve our City? I again do know, that
but few in these days requite benefits with thanks, longer than while they
are in receiving. In brief, I envy her, and she shall perish for it. With the
which words she had no sooner concluded, but in comes a servant of hers, and
she now intended to make him the devils. With this Leonine she thus began to
interpret her will: Leonine quoth she, thou know Marina. And madame, quoth
he, for a most virtuous Gentlewoman. Talk not of virtue, quoth Dyonysa, for
that's not the business which we have in hand; but I must have thee learn to
know her now, that thou may never know her afterward. I understand you not
quoth Leonine. When she replied, Take this at large then, Thou art my
bond-slaue, whom I have power to enfranchise or captive, if thou will obey me,
first then receive this gold as the earnest which promises unto thee a
greater reward: but if thou deny to accomplish my desire, in bondage and
imprisonment, I will fetter thee, and by no other means conclude my revenge,
but by thy death. Speak on my task then good Madam, quoth Leonine, For what
is it that a bondsman will not attempt for liberty, which is deeter to man then
life, and what not I then? Thou know, quoth Dyonysa then, that Marina has a
custom, as soon as she returns home from school, not to eat meat before
she have gone to visit the sepulcher of her nurse. There at her next devotion,
do thou meet her, stand ready, and with thy weapon drawn, suddenly kill
her. Now kill her quoth Leonine, why it is an act unconscionable, and deserves
damnation but to conspire in thought, since she is a creature so harmless,
that even Innocence it self cannot be more pure, nor inwardly be more
decently arrayed than is her mind: yet to fulfill your pleasure, for the hope
of gold, and the releasement of my bondage, were she as spotless as Truth,
here are two monsters (drawing his swords into his hand) shall effect it for
you, when she rewarding him with more gold, and commending his resolution, he
goes forward to attend for her at Lycoridaes Toombe, and Marina being returned
from School, is also come thither to offer on the monument her diurnall
devotion, when on the sudden, while her knees kissed the earth, and her eyes
saluted heaven, while prayers were in her mouth, and tears in her eyes, all
tributary offerings, given unto the gods for the prosperity of her father, on
the sudden toward her, out rushed this Leonine, and with a look as cruel as
his heart, and speech as harsh as his intent, he resolved her in blunt words,
that he was come to kill her, that be was hired unto it by Dyonysa her foster
mother, that she was too good for men, and therefore he would send her to the
gods, that if she would pray, pray, for he had sworn to kill her, and he
would kill her, and a thousand more, ere he would be damned for perjury. When
she that was on her knees before making her orisons to heaven, was now
compelled to turn her entreaties to him: and first demanded of him what
offense her ignorance had done (for wittingly she knew she could do done)
either to him. that (as himself said) came to murder her, or to her that
hired him. But the villain neither regarding her innocence or tears, though
showred in abundance, but drawing out his sword wherewith to have shed her
blood, and have damned his own soul, there were certain pirates that were
newly put to water, in at a Creek near adjoining, where the villain intended
this most inhumane murder, and being come up ashoare to forage, for what
pillage soever they could happen upon, even as he was about to have given the
fatal blow; whom all her entreaties could not persuade him from, beholding so
bloody a villain, offering violence to so goodly a beauty, they running all at
once toward him cried out aloude; Hold monstrous wretch, as thou love thy
life, hold, for that Maiden is our prey, and not thy victory. Which when the
villain heard, and perceiving his intent to be intercepted, making his heels
his best defense, till having fled some distance from them, and observing
them not to pursue, he secretly stole back, to note what the event would be,
which was, that the pirates who had thus rescued Marina, carried her to their
ships, hoysed sails, and departed. At which the vilaine returned home to his
Mistress, declaring to her that he had done what she commanded him to do,
namely murdered Marina, and from the top of a high cliffe, thrown her body
down for burial into the Sea, aduising her withal, that since it was done,
the chiefest means to avoid suspicion, was, to put on mourning garments, and
by counterfeiting a great sorrow, in the sight of the people report, that she
was dead of some dangerous disease: and withal, to blears the eyes of the
multitude (who with fair shows are soon flattered) near to her fathers
Statue to erect a monument for her. According whereunto, she attyred her self
and her daughter in solemn attire, and counterfeiting a fained sorrow, and
dissembling tears. And going now to erect her monument (to the view of which,
all the Citizens flocked) She in public assembly thus spoke unto them. Dear
Friends and Citizens of Tharsus, If you shall happly wonder, why we thus
vnwoontedly weep and mourn in your sight, it is because the joy of our eyes
and staff of our old age Marina is dead, whose absence has left unto us
nothing but salt tears, and sorrowful hearts, as if by her death we were
divided from all comfort, yet have we here taken order for her funerals, and
buried her (as here you see) according to her degree, which loss of hers was
right grievous to all the people, nor was there any that was capable of
sorrow, but spent it for her, so that with one boyce and willing hands, they
attended Dyonysa to the Market place whereas her fathers Image stood, made of
brass, and erected also another to her with this Inscription:

Marinaes Epitaph.
The fairest, chastest, and most best lies here,
Who wythred in her spring of year:
In Natures garden, though by growth a Bud,
She was the chiefest flower, she was good.
So with this flattery, (which is like a Skreene before the grauest Judgments)
deceiving the Citizens, and all done, unsuspected she returned home, when
Cleon, who not at all consented to this treason, but so soon as he heard
thereof, being struck into amazement, he apparelled himself in mourning
garments, lamenting the untimely ruin of so goodly a Lady, saying to himself,
Alas now, what mischief am I wrapped in, what might I do or say herein? The
Father of that Uirgine delivered this City from the peril of death, for this
Cities sake he suffered ship wrack, lost his goods, and endured penury, and
now he is requited with evil for good, his daughter which he committed by my
care to be brought up, is now devoured by the cruelty of my wife, so that I am
deprived, as it were, of mine own eyes, and forced to bewail the death of
that Innocent, she in whose presence, as in the fortune of mine own posterity I
should have had delight. And then demanding of Dyonysa how she could give
prince Pericles account of his child, having robbed him of his child, how she
could appease the fury of his wrath, if her act were known to him? or how
alay the displeasure of the gods, from whom nothing can be hid. For Pericles
quoth she, if such a pious innocent as your self do not reveal it unto him,
how should he come to the knowledge thereof, since that the whole City is
satisfied by the monument I caused to be erected, and by our dissembling
outside, that she died naturally, and for the gods, let them that list be of
the mind to think they can make stones speak, and raise them up in evidence,
for my part I have my wish, I have my safety, and fear no danger till it
fall upon me. But Cleon rather cursing then commending this obduracy in her, he
continued mourning unfeignedly, but she according to her sinful condition. By
this time the pirates (who before rescued Marina, when she should have been
slain by treacherous Leonine) are now arrived at Meteline, and in the Market
place of the City, according to the custom, amongst other bondslaues,
offered her to be sold, whither all sorts of people, coming to supply their
purposes, Marina was net without much commendations gazed upon of the buyers,
some commending her beauty, others her sober countenance, all pitying her
mishap, and praising her perfections, which praises of her, were so spread
through the City, that from all parts they came crowding to see her, amongst
the number of which, was a Leno or ^awde, yet one who had not set up shop* and
kept trade for himself, but was yet but iourney-man to the devil. This Leon
amongst others, staring upon her, and knowing her face to be a fit fair* sign
for his masters house, and with which sign he made no doubt, but to lodge
under their roof, all the intemperate (even from youth to age) through the
whole City, he forth with demanded the price, intending to buy her, at what
rate soever, and in the end, went through, and bargained to have her, paying a
hundred Sestercies of gold, and so presently having given earnest, he takes
Marina, and the rest of the Pirates home with him to his Masters house, Marina
was there to be taught how to give her body up a prostitute to sin, and the
Pirates for their new stuff to receive their money.

The tenth Chapter.
How Marina being thus sold to a Bawd, preserved her virginity, and how she
converted all that ever came to make hire of her beauty from the looseness of
their desires.

MArina was no sooner thus concluded for, by the he Bawd, but the Pirates
were as soon brought home to his masters house, and received their payment,
when after their departure, she giving command to the Pander her man, that he
should go back into the Market place, and there with open cry proclaim,
what a picture of Nature they had at home, for every lascivious eye to gaze
upon. The she Bawd began to instruct her, with what complement she should
entertain her customers: she first asked her, if she were a virgin. When
Marina replied, she thanked the Gods, she never knew what it was to be
otherwise. In so being quoth the she bawd, you have been well: but now in
plain terms I must teach you how to be worse. It is not goodness in you
(quoth Marina) to teach me to be so: for goodness answered the bawd, it is a
Lecture, such as we use seldom, and our consciences never read one to
another, and therefore attend unto me: you must now be like a stake for every
man to shoot at, you must be like a foord that must receive all waters, you
must have the benefit of all nations, and seem to take delight in all men. I
thank my stars, answered Marina, I am displeased with none: for by this
answer it appeared such was the purity of her mind, that she understood not
what this devils solicitor pleaded unto her: but she quickly taking her off,
told in more immodest phrase, that she had paid for her, and that she and all
her body was hers, that will ye nill ye she must now be what she her self had
been (and there is seldom any bawd, but before time, has been a whore)
that to conclude, she had bought her like a beast, and she meant to hire her
out.

When she understanding unwillingly what all these words tended unto, she fell
prostrate at her feet, and with tears showred down in abundance, she
entreated her, not to make hire of her body to so diseasefull a use, which
she hoped the gods had ordained to a more happy purpose. When the bawd
answered her, Come, come, these drops avail thee not, thou art now mine,
and I will make my best of thee: and I must now learn you to know, we whom the
world calls Bawdes, but more properly are to be styled Factors for men, are
in this like the hangman, neither to regard prayers, nor tears, but our own
profit. So calling for her slave, which was governor over her she-houshold,
this was her appointment unto him, Go quoth she and take this Maiden, as she
is thus decked in costly apparel (for it is to be remembered, that the former
Pirates had no way dispoyled her of her ornaments, with purpose to prise her at
the higher rate) and leading her along, this be the cry through the whole
City, That whosoever desires the purchase of so wondrous a beauty, shall for
his first enjoying her, pay ten pieces of gold, and that afterward she
shall be common unto the people for one piece at a time. Which will of hers,
Marina being no way able to resist, but with her sorrow, only desiring of the
good gods, to be protectors of her chastity: She with this her slave was
hurried along, and who with the tenor of his priapine proclamation, had so
awaked the intemperaunce of the whole City, that against her return, of high
and low there was a full corwding at the door, every man carrying his money in
his hand, and thinking him the happiest man that might first have access. But
heaven who is still a protector of Virtue against Uice, ordained this for
Marina, that the sending her abroad, with purpose, first to show her, and
after, to make sale of her to the world, was the only means to defend her in
the state of her virginity. For as she was (as before is said) led along, and
thousands of people wondering about her, and flocking as it had been so many
flies, to infect so delicate a preservative, it happened that Lysimachus the
chief governor of Meteline, looking out at his window, to observe what
strange occasion drew the giddy havoc of people, to muster themselves into
such throngs: he, not without great admiration observed, that it was to make
boot of so precious a beauty, whose inflaming colors which Nature had with
her best Art placed upon her face, compelled him to censure, that she was
rather a deserving bedfellow for a Prince, than a play-fellow for so rascally
an assembly: so pitying a while her misfortune, that it was so hard, to be
thrown into the iaws of two such poisonous and devouring serpents, a Pandar,
and a Bawd, yet at last, being inflamed with alittle sinful concupiscence,
by the power of her face, he resolved himself* that since she must fall, it
were far more fitter, into his own arms, whose authority could stretch to
do* her good, than into the hot imbracements of many, to her utter ruin; so
presently dismissing away a servant of his, he gave him charge, to give in
charge to the Bawd, that at the return home, of this new piece of merchandise
of hers, as she respected, or in time of need would be beholding to his
savor, (and Heavens forfend but Bawdes now and then should stand in need of
authority) she should keep her private from the conference of any, for he
himself that night late in the evening, in secret, and in some disguise, would
(for her guests sake) visit her house. There needed no further encouragement
to bid the Bawd stir up her damnable limbs to make all fit. It was enough
in this, that the Governor had sent word, it was he that was to come. But
having given the best garnish she could to her sinful habitation: and Marina
being returned home again by the Pandar, who had led her up and down as
Bear herds lead bears, for show first, and to be baited after: She took
her up with her into a private Chamber, when the fruit of her instructions
were, how she should now learn to behave her self, for she had fortunes
coming upon her, she was now to be received, respected, and regarded of a
man that was honorable. Heaven grant that I may find him so, quoth Marina.
Thou need not doubt it sweet heart, quoth the Bawd, for though I tell it
thee in private, which for a million he would not have to be known publicly:
He is no worse a man thou art shortly to deal withal, than the Governor
of this whole City, a Gentleman that is courteous, a favorer of our calling,
one that will as soon have his hand in his pocket, as such a pretty dilling as
thou shall come in his eye, and not as most of our Gentlemen do, draw it out
empty, but filling it full of gold, will most loue-like rain it down into
his Danaes lap. In brief, he is a Nobleman, and, which is a thing which we
respect more than his nobility, he is liberal: he is courteous, and thou
may command him, he is virtuous and thou may learn of him. All these
indeed, answered Marina, are properties, due unto so worthy a Gentleman, whom
you picture him to be: and if he be liberal in good, I shall be glad to taste
of his bounty: if courteous, I shall as willingly become his servant: and if
virtuous, it shall be in me no way to make him vicious. Well, well, well, says
the Bawd, we must have no more of this puling, and I must have you learn to
know, that vice is as hereditary to our house, as the old barn to your
country beggar. But as she would have proceeded with more of these her
devilish counsels, hastily into the Chamber came the Pandar unto them, who as
hot as a toste, with his haste to bring the news he told, them, that the
Lord Lysimachus was come, and as if the word Come had been his kew, he entered
the Chamber with the master bawd, when the whole fry of sinners cursying
about him, he very largely, as the Prologue to his entertainment, distributed
gold among them, and then as roundly demanded, for that same fresh piece of
stuff, which by their proclamation they told, they had now to make sale of,
and be of set purpose was come to have a sight of.

When they all poynting toward Marina, told him there she was, and for our
selves, quoth they, we having done the office of right Chamberlaines, brought
you together, we will shut the door after us, and so leave you. Who no sooner
departed, but Lysimachus the Governor began to demand of her the performaunce
of that for which he came. When she prostrating her self at his feet,
entreated him to take pity of her, and from point to point (excepting her
birth, and death of her parents) discoursed unto him the whole story of her
misfortunes: as that by the practice of Dyonysa, and cruelty of Leonine, she
should have been murdered. And how it pleased the Gods to rescue her from
that ruin by certain Pirates, who after sold her to this brothell, where,
most unhappy, he was witness she remained. Then gentle Sir, quoth she, since
heaven has been so gracious, to restore me from death, let not their good to
me, be a means for you, to be author of my more misfortune. But the Governor
suspecting these tears, but to be some new cunning, which her matron the Bawd
had instructed her in, to draw him to a more large expense: He as freely told
her so, and now began to be more rough with her, urging her, that he was the
Governor, whose authority could wincke at those blemishes, her self, and
that sinful house could cast upon her, or his displeasure punish at his
own pleasure, which displeasure of mine, thy beauty shall not privilege thee
from, nor my affection, which has drawn me unto this place abate, if thou
with further lingering withstand me. By which words, she understanding him to
be as confident in evil, as she was constant in good, she entreated him but to
be heard, and thus she began.

If as you say (my Lord) you are the Governor, let not your authority, which
should teach you to rule others, be the means to make you mis-gouerne your
self: If the eminence of your place came unto you by descent, and the royalty
of your blood, let not your life prove your birth a bastard: If it were
thrown upon you by opinion, make good, that opinion was the cause to make you
great. What reason is there in your Justice, who has power over all, to undo
any? If you take from me mine honor, you are like him, that makes a gappe
into forbidden ground, after whom too many enter, and you are guilty of all
their euilles: my life is yet unspotted, my chastity unstained in thought.
Then if your violence deface this building, the workmanship of heaven, made up
for good, and not to be the exercise of sins intemperaunce, you do kill your
own honor, abuse your own justice, and impouerish me. Why quoth Lysimachus,
this house wherein thou live, is even the receptacle of all men's sin es, and
nurse of wickedness, and how can thou then be otherwise then naught, that
live in it? It is not good, answered Marina, when you that are the Governor,
who should live well, the better to be bold to punish evil, do know that
there is such a roof, and yet come under it. Is there a necessity (my yet
good Lord) if there be fire before me, that I must strait then thither fly and
burn my self? Or if suppose this house, (which too too many feel such houses
are) should be the Doctors patrimony, and Surgeons feeding; folowes it
therefore, that I must needs infect my self to give them maintenance? O my good
Lord, kill me, but not deflower me, punish me how you please, so you spare my
chastity, and since it is all the dowry that both the Gods have given, and men
have left to me, do not you take it from me; make me your servant, I will
willingly obey you; make me your bond woman, I will account it freedom; let
me be the worst that is called vile, so I may still live honest, I am content:
or if you think it is too blessed a happiness to have me so, let me even now,
now in this minute die, and I Will account my death more happy than my birth. With
which words (being spoken upon her knees) while her eyes were the glasses that
carried the water of her mis-hap, the good Gentlewoman being moved, he lift
her up with his hands, and even then embraced her in his heart, saying aside*
Now surely this is Uirtues image, or rather, Uertues self, sent down from
heaven, a while to reign on earth, to teach us what we should be. So in steed
of willing her to dry her eyes, he wiped the wet himself eff, and could have
found in his heart, with modest thoughts to have kissed her, but that he
feared the offer would offend her. This only he said, Lady, for such your
virtues are, a far more worthy style your beuty challenges, and no way less
your beauty can promise me that you are, I hither came with thoughts
intemperale, soul and deformed, the which your pains so well has laued, that
they are now white, continue still to all so, and for my part, who hither came
but to have paid the price, a piece of gold for your virginity, now give you
twenty to relieve your honesty. It shall become you still to be even as you
are, a piece of goodness, the best wrought up, that ever Nature made, and if
that any shall enforce you ill, if you but send to me, I am your friend. With
which promise, leaving her presence, she most humbly thanked the Gods for the
preservation of her chastity, and the reformation of his mind.

Lysimachus though departed, thus intended not to leave her so, but with
diligent eyes to attend, how she behaved her self to all other, who should
have admittance to her, and for that purpose, having power to command the
Bawd, he placed himself in the next Chamber, where he might hear, even to a
syllable, whatsoere passed, where he was no sooner settled with a former charge
given to the bawd, that any man should have access to her, but by turns, he
heard she had also won others, and preserved herself from them, as she had
formerly done against him, gaining ten times as much of profit by her
prayers and tears, as she should have done by prostituting her beauty to
their wills: at last, all of them being departed, and the house unfrequented,
only of their own householde, and of the Governor, the bawd standing ready
at the door, as he should go out, making his obeysaunce unto him as he
should return, in hope of his fee or reward, he with an angry brow turned
toward him, saying, Uillaine, thou have a house here, the weight of whose
sin would sincke the foundation, even unto hell, did not the virtue of one
that is lodged therein, keep it standing; and so, as it were enraged, giving
them nothing, he departed. By which displeasure of his, the whole swarm of
bawdes (as truly it was) ghessed, that their new tenant, had not been pliant
to his will: and all rushing in hastily upon her, first taking away the gold
which the charity (and not injury of all who had been there) had given her to
relieve her with, they cried against her, they should be all undone by her,
their house would grow uncustomed, and their trading would fall to decay, by
her squeamishness, and want of familiarity to their Clients, resolving now,
that there was no way to bring her unto their bow, but by having her ravished.
For it is to be noted, not any that parted the house besides Lysimachus, but
even as he did, so they in like manner rayled against them, so forcibly had her
persuasions prevailed with them: whereupon, for that purpose they gave her up
to the Pandar, who first agreed for her, saying; That he that had bargained for
the whole joint, it was fittest for him to cut a morsel from off the spit. So
leaving them together, and telling him, they gave her up to his power, to do
even what he would with her: the man and wife (though both bawdes) departed,
when the pandar going to her, told her, that he, his master, nor their ancient
family would as thus long they had been, be undone by ere a Puritan piece of
them all. And therefore quoth he; Come on and resolve your self without more
whining, for I am but the bawdes servant. The bawd has commanded me, and
every servant by the Indenture of his dnety, is bound to obey his master: So
catching her rashly by the hand, as he would have enforced her to his will; she
first calling on Diana patroness of Chastity to defend her, fell likewise
down at his feet, and besought him but to hear her: which being granted,
she demanded of him what thing he could wish himself to be, which was more
vile than he was, or more hateful than he would make himself to be? Why my
master or my mistress (quoth the villain) I think, who have all the sins
subject to mankind reigning in them, and are (indeed) as bad as the Devil
himself: yet (quoth Marina) thou go about to be worse then they, and to do
an office at their setting on, which thy master himself has more pity then
to attempt, to rob me of mine honor, which in spite of them and thee, the
Gods (who I hope will protect it still) have till this breathing protected, to
leprous my chaste thoghts, with remembrance of so foul a deed, which thou then
shall have done, to damn thine own soul, by undoing of mine. At which
word, the Uillaine being struck into some remorce, and standing in a pawse,
Marina went forward, and told him; If thou want gold, there is some for
thee (part of that she had reserved which before was given her, from the bawdes
knowledge:) or if thou want maintenance, provide me but some residence in
an honest house, and I have experience in many things which shall labor for
thee, as namely, I am skillful in the seven Liberal Sciences, well exercised
in all studies, and dare approve this, that my skill in singing and playing on
Instruments exceeds any in the city: therefore (quoth she) as thou before
did proclaim my beuty in the market to the open world, whereby to have made
me a common prostitute, so now again proclaim my virtues unto them, and I
doubt not but this honorable city will afford scholars sufficient, the
instructing of whom will return profit enough, both to repay the Master
what he paid out for me, provide an honester course for thee then this thou
live in, and give a quiet content unto my self. Sooth (quoth the Uillaine)
being now moved unto much more compassion of her; If you have (as you say)
these qualities, I will labor with my Master, and do my best for your
release. If not (answered Marina, I give thee free leave to bring me back
again, and prostitute me to that course which was first pretended for me. In
brief, the Uillaine so labored with the bawd his master, that though he
would not give her leave to depart his house, yet in hope of the profit, which
would come in by her other qualities, she should stay in his house, and none,
with her former greeuances disturb her, and withal, charged the Pander, to
set up a Bill in the Market place, of her excellency in speaking, and in
singing. At the report of which there crowded as many to the bawdes great
profit to be delighted with her worth, as there came before to have made
spoil of her virtue, and not any man but gave her money largely, and departed
contented, only above the rest the Lord Lysimachus had evermore an especial
regard in the preservation of her safety no otherwise than if she had been
descendaed from himself, and rewarded the villain very liberally for the
diligent care he had over her.

The elouenth Chapter.
How Pericles after fourteen years absence, arrived at Tharsus, and not
finding his daughter, lamented her supposed death: and how taking ship again,
he was by cross winds driven to Meteline, where his daughter Marina was: and
how by the means of Prince Lysimachus coming aboorde his ship to comfort
him, he came to the knowledge of his lost daughter, and also of his wife Thaysa.

Having thus preserved Marina, our Story gives us now leave to return again
to Prince Pericles, who after fourteen years absence arrived at Tharsus, and
was received into the house of Cleon and Dyonysa, with whom he had left his
young daughter Marina to be fostered up. At the news of whose coming, Cleon
and Dyonysa again apparrelled themselves in mournful habites, went out to
meet him: who when Pericles beheld in so sad an outside; My trusty friends,
what cause inforceth you to give so sad a welcome to my entertainment? O my
good Lord, answered Dyonysa, would any tongue but ours might be the herald of
your mis-hap: but sorrows pipes will burst, have they not vent, and you of
force must know Marina is dead. Which when Pericles heard, the very word Death
seemed like an edge that cut his heart, his flesh trembled, and his strength
failed: yet in that agony a long time standing amassed, with his eyes
intentiuely fixed on the ground, and at length recovering himself, and taking
breath, he first cast his eyes up to heaven, saying; O you Gods! extremity
of passion does make me almost ready to accuse you of injustice. And then
throwing his eyes greedily upon her. But woman, quoth he, If (as thou say)
my most dear Marina be dead, is the money and the treasure which I also left
with you for her, perished with her? When she answered; Some is, and some yet
remains. And as for your daughter (my Lord) lest you should any way suspect
us, we have sufficient witness: for our Citizens being mindful of your
benefits bestowed upon them, have erected unto her a monument of brass fast
by yours. And when she had so said, she brought forth such money, jewels, and
apparel as it pleased her to say were remaining of Marinaes store. Whereupon
Pericles giving credit to this report of her death, he commanded his servants
to take up what she had brought, and bear them to his ships, while he
himself would go visit his daughters monument. Which when he beheld, and had
read the Epitaph, as before written, his affection brake out into his eyes, and
he expressed more actual sorrow for the loss of her then Indictment can
express: first, tumbling himself upon her monument, he then fell into a
swownd, as if, since he might not leave all his life with her, yet he would
leave half at least, from which trance being at the length recovered, he
apparrelles himself in sacke-cloth, running hastily unto his ships, desires
the Sea to take him into their womb, since neither land nor water was
fortunate unto him; for the one had bereft him of a daughter, the other of a
wife. But as befitted the^, being most careful of his safty, they used their
best persuasions, to assuage this tempest of his sorrow; presently, as much as
might be in such a case, they prevailed, and partly by time, which is a curer
of all ca^es, continually mittigated some part of the grief. When he
perceiving the wind to stand fit for their departure, he hoysed up
sails, and gave farewel^ to the shore, nor had they long sailed in their
course, but the wind came about into a contrary quarter, and blew so fiercely
that it troubled both sea and ships, the rain fell fiercely from above, and
the sea wrought woonderously underneath, so that the tempest being terrible for
the time, it was in that extreamitie thought fittest to strike sail, to let
the Helm go, and to suffer the ship to drive with the tide, whither it
would please the gods to direct it: But as Joy evermore succeeds Heaviness,
so was this sharp storm occasion of a joyful meeting, betwixt this sorrowful
father, and his lost daughter; for while Prince Pericles ship is thus
governed at randon, by fortune it strikes upon the shore of the City
Meteline, where now Marina remained, of whose death he (as before) being fully
persuaded, in whose life he had hope his decayed comfortes should again have
had new growth. And being now again at sea, he vowed to himself never more to
have fellowshippe or conference with any man, charging all his folowers, of
whom Helycanus was one, that none of them upon the pain of his displeasure
(and who is ignorant that the displeasure of kings is as dangerous as death)
should dare to speak unto him: no not so much as they who attended him with
meat, and withal commanded them, that they should not ordain for him any
more but so small a competence, as might even scarcely maintain nature,
accompting now that life which he possessed, tedious to him, and wishing death
in the most unfriendly languishment. In which state while he consisted, pining
of his body, and perplexed in mind, it happened, that at one self same time
Lord Helycanus going from the Princes ship, and landing on the shore, the
Governor Lysimachus, who (as before is mentioned) tenderd Marina, was standing
at the haven, and noting Pericles ships riding there at anchor, he began with
himself to commend the comeliness of the vessels, and applaude the state
they vphelde in their burdens, and in especially, that of the Admiral wherein
the Prince himself was, who seeing Helycanus come on shore, and his grave and
reverent countenance promising him, to be a father of experience, and worthy
of his conference, he in courteous manner saluted him, and demanded of him, of
whence those ships were, for sir quoth he, by their arms and ensigns I
perceive they are strangers to our harbors, as also that it would please him
to deliver to him who was the owner of them, when Helycanus, as in the whole
Story, discoursed unto him his misfortunes, as also of his former worth, and
his present languishment, from which he could not be removed, neither by his
own wisdom, nor by the counsel of his friends. When Lysimachus pitying his
ruins, entreated Helycanus that he might speak with him, whereby to try if his
persuasions had power to prevail with him more then the will of himself, or
power of his subjects. Which being by Helycanus granted, he forthwith
conducted him down where his Master lay: whom when Lysimachus beheld, so
attired from the ordinary habit of other men, as with a long ouer-growne
beard, diffused hair, indecent nails on his fingers, and himself lying upon
his cowch groueling on his face. He somewhat astonished at the strangenes
thereof, caled unto him with a soft voice, Prince Pericles, who hearing
himself named, and thinking it to be some of his men, that called upon him
contrary to his cemmaundement, he arose up suddenly with a fierce
countenance: but seeing him to be a stranger, very comely and honorably
attyred, he shruncke himself down upon his pillow, and held his peace. When
Lysimachus demanded of Helycanus if it were his custom to be so silent to all
men. Sir, it is quoth he, and has continued so for the space of this month,
neither dare any of us his subjects, though we suffer much sorrow for him, by
our persuasions seek to alter him. Now surely quoth Lysimachus, though his
misfortunes have been great, and by which he has great cause for this sorrow,
it is great pity he should continue thus perverse and obstinate, or so noble a
gentleman come to so dishonorable a death: and thereuppon bethinking with
himself what honorable means he might use to recover him. He suddenly
remembering the wisdom that he had known Marina had in persuasion: and having
heard since of her excellent skill in music, singing and dancing: he by the
consent of Helycanus caused her to be sent for, resolving with himself, that
if the excellency of her ministry had no power to work on him, all physic
was in vain, and he from thence would resign him over to his grave. The
messenger speedily is returned, bringing Marina along with him: whom when
Lysimachus beheld, Marina quoth he, let me request of thee, thy help and
uttermost knowledge in comforting the owner of this ship which lies in
darkness, and will receive no comfort, nor come abroad into the light, for
the sorrow that he conceiueth through the loss of a wife and a daughter. From
which if thou recover him, and to his former health restore him, I will, as I
am a Gentleman, give thee in recompense thirty sistercies of gold, and as
many of silver, and though the bawd has bought thee, according to the laws of
our city, from whom no authority can compel thee, yet for thirty days will
I redeem thee. Which when Marina heard, she went boldly down into the
cabine to him, and with a mild voice saluted him, saying; God save you sir,
and be of good comfort, for an innocent Uirgin, whose life has bin distressed
by shipwreck, and her chastity by dishonesty, and has yet bin preserved from
both, thus courteously saluteth thee: but perceuing him to yield her no answer,
she began to record in verses, and therewithal to sing so sweetly, that
Pericles, notwithstanding his great sorrow, woondered at her, at last, taking
up another instrument unto his ears she preferred this.

Amongst the harlots foul I walk,
Yet harlot none am I;
The Rose amongst the Thorns does grow,
And is not hurt thereby.
The Thief that stole me sure I think,
Is slain before this time.
A Bawd me bought, yet am I not
Defilde by fleshly crime:
Nothing were pleasanter to me,
Then parents mine to know.
I am the issue of a King,
My blood from Kings does flow:
In time the heavens may mend my state,
And send a better day,
For sorrow adds unto our griefs,
But helps not any way:
Show gladness in your countenance,
Cast up your cheerful eyes,
That God remains, that once of naught
Created Earth and Skies.
With this Music of Marinaes, as with no delight else was he a whit altered,
but lay groueling on his face, only casting an eye upon her, as he were
rather discontented than delighted with her endeavor. Whereupon she began
with moral pre^^pts to reprove him, and told him, that he was borne a
Prince, whose dignity being to govern others, it was most foul in him to
misgouerne himself. Which while he continued in that sullen estate, he did no
less, thus to mourn for the loss of a wife and child, or at any of his own
mis fortunes, approved that he was an enemy to the authority of the heavens,
whose power was to dispose of him and his, at their pleasure: and that it was
as unfit to for him to repine (for his continuing sorrow showed he did no
less) against their determinations and their unaltered wills, as it was for
the Giants to make war against the Gods, who were confounded in their
enterprise. Not fit to sorrow, quoth he, rising up like a Cloud, that
bespeaks thunder; presumptuous bewty in a child, how dare thou urge so
much^ and there withal, in this rash distemperature, struck her on the face.
When she, who never until that time kn^w what blows were, fell suddenly in a
swowne: but being again recovered, she cried out; O humility! ordained
especially for Princes, who having power over all, should contemn none, whither
art thou fled? then weeping a while; And O you Gods! creators both of heaven
and earth, look upon my afflictions, and take compassion upon me, that am
unfortunate in all things, I have bin tossed from wrong to injury, I was borne
amongst the waves and troublesome tempests of the Sea, my mother died in
pains and pangs of childbirth, and burial was denied her on the earth, whom
my father adorned with Iewelles laid gold at her head, and silver at her
feet, and enclosing her in a Chest, committed her to the Sea: As for me
unfortunate wretch, my father, who with princely furniture, put me (in trust)
to Cleon and Dyonysa, who commanded a servant of theirs to murder me, from
whose cruelty by Pirates I was rescewed, brought by them to this City, and
sold to have been hackneyd by a common Bawd, though (I thank the heavens) I
have preserved my chastity; and now after al these crosses, for my courtesies to
be struck thus to bleeding! O cruel fate! By which tale of hers, Pericles
being moved, since by all the circumstances he ghessed she was his child, and
yet not knowing whether he might believe himself to be awake, or in a dream,
he began again to capitulate with her, of her former relation, as namely,
where she was borne, who were her parents, and what her name was. To the which
she answered, My name is Marina, and so called because I was borne upon the
sea. O my Marina cried out Pericies, bring struck into such an extaste of joy
that he was not able to contain himself! willing her again to discourse
unto him the story of her misfortunes, for he could not hear too much. Which
she obeying him in, and he knowing her to be his child, seeing that the
supposed dead was risen again, he falls on her neck, and kisses her, calls
upon Helycanus to come unto him, sh^wes him his daughter, biddes him to kneel
to her, thanketh Lysimachus that so fortunately had brought her to begette life
in the father who begot her; so one while weeping at others ioying, and his
senses being masterd by a gentle conqueror, in that extreamitie of passion, he
fell into a slumber: in which sweet sleep of his, he was by Diana, warned to
hie to Ephesus: and there upon the Altar of that Goddess to offer up his
sacrifice before the Priests, and there to discourse the whole progress of his
life: which he remembering, being awake, he accordingly shipped himself with
Lysimachus, Marina, and his own subjects to perform. Who landing at Ephesus,
and giving notice of the purpose, for which he was come, he was by all the
Priests and Uotaries attended to the Temple; and being brought to the Altar,
this was the substance of his sacrifice, I Pericles borne Prince of Tire, who
having in youth attained to all kind of knowledge, resolved the Riddle of
Antiochus, to the intent to have married his daughter, whom he most shamefully
defiled. To preserve my self from whose anger, I fled to sea, suffered
shipwreck, was courteously entertained by good Symonides king of Pentapolis,
and after espoused his fair daughter Thaysa. At the naming of whom, she her
self being by, could not choose but starte: for in this Temple was she placed
to be a Nun, by Lord Cerimon, who preserved her life. But Pericles going on,
when Antiochus and his daughter, quoth he, were by lightning struck dead from
heaven, I conducted my Queen with me from her fathers Court, with purpose to
receive again my kingdom: where upon the sea she was delivered of this my
daughter, in that travel she died, whom I enclosed in a Chest, and threw it
into the Sea. When Thaysa standing by, and no longer being able to temper her
affections, being assured he was her Lord, she ran hastily unto him,
embraced him in her arms, and would have kissed him. Which when Pericles saw,
he was moved with disdain, and thrust her from him, accusing her for
lightness, whose modesty and good grace he at his first entrance did commend,
when she falling at his feet, and pouring forth her tears abundantly,
gladness compelled her to cry out, O my Lord Pericles, deal not ungently
with me, I am your wife, daughter unto Symonides, my name is Thaysa, you were
my Schoolemaister, and instructed me in music, you are that Prince whom I
loved, not for concupiscence, but desire of wisdom, I am she which was
delivered and died at the sea, and by your own hands was buried in the deepes;
which words of hers, Lord Cerimon standing by, he was ready to auerre, but it
needed not: for Pericles, though at the first astonished, joy had now so
revived his spirits, that he knew her to be herself: but throwing his head
into her bosom, having nothing but this to utter, he cried aloude, O you
heavens! my misfortunes were now again blessings, since we are again
contracted; so giving his daughter to her arms to embrace her as a child and
Lysimachus to enfolde her as a wife, and giving order the solemnity of marriage
should strait be provided for: he then caused the bawd to be burnt, who with so
much labor had sought to violate her princely chastity, whilst Marina
rewarded the pandar, who had been so faithful to her: and then after he had
seen her marriage with Lisimachus, he leaves Ephesus, and intendes for Tire,
taking Pentapolis in his way, whom by the death of good Symonides, as lawful
heir, he was made sovereign. He also highly rewarded the poor Fishermen,
who had relieved him. From thence he arrived at Tharsus, where he revenged
himself of Cleon and Dyonysa, by stoning them to death. From thence to Tire,
where peaceably he was received into his kingdom, and given also possession of
all the territories of Antiochus, where by his wife, though in the declining of
both their years, it pleased the Gods to bless him with a son, who growing
to the lusty strength of youth, and the father declining to his grave, age
being no longer able to be sustained by the benefit of nature, fell into
certain cold and dry diseases: in which case, the knowledge of his
Physicians, could stand him in little stead, either by their cunning or
experience, (so as no remedy being to be found against death) being in perfect
memory, he departed this life in the arms of his beloved Thaysa, and in the
midst of his friends, nobles, alies and children in great honor, his
kingdom of Tyrus be gave by will to Lysimachus and his daughter Marina, and to
their heirs after them for ever, who lived long together, and had much comfort
by their issue. Unto his Queen Thaysa he gave the two kingdoms of Antioch and
Pentapolis for term of her life, and at her death to descend to her young
son Symonides. But Thaysa who could not then be young since Pericles died
old, continued not long in her widows estate, butpining much with sorrow, and
wearing with age, forsook the present world, leaving her two kingdoms
(according to her fathers will) to her young son Symonides.
