THE INTRODVCTION to the true understanding of the whole Art of Expedition in
teaching to write.

Intermixed with rare discourses of other matters, to show the possibility of
skill in teaching, and probability of success in learning, to write in 6.
hours

Which tending all to one end, do serve for two uses.

1. If Authors do excel others in their own Arts, Why may not this Author
excel others in his Art.

2. For removing a vulgar opinion against his native country of Scotland. he
shows that it has more excellent Prerogatives than any other Kingdom.

Whereby it will rather follow, that a Scotishman is so much the more able to
prosecute whatsoever he undertaketh, and therefore so much the more to be
respected, by how so much he is more ingenuous than one of another nation.

Anno Dom. 1638.

TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND HOPEFVLL PRINCE, CHARLES Prince of WALES, etc.
temporal prosperity and endless felicity.
MAy it please your Highness?

In regard that some have a sinister opinion of me in my profession, not only
because of the pretended impossibility of the succes thereof, but far more of
that worthy nation, where all your Highness most royal Progenitors had their
being, and whereof I also have the honor to be a native, and lest any either
of their writings or speeches should come to your Highness sight or hearing,
now in your tender years, I have labored here to prevent them, by defending
both my Country and profession.

Where as these things are propounded here in the superlative degree, I
suppose it is according to the practice of worthy men in former times, when
their persons, professions, countries, or causes have been any ways traduced,
they have not only defended the same to the uttermost of their power, but even
stretched all and whatso-ever their properties privileges, or liberties to the
furthest extent, that their adversaries might be either convinced or silenced.

Whenever it shall please God your Highness shall have occasion to use that
ancient nation, yea or any member thereof (such as my self) in any service, I
hope your Highness shall find us as faithful, able and willing now, as our
predecessors have been to your Highness royal progenitors informer times.

Now in token of my goodwill and affection, I humbly present your Highness
with these my mean labors, that they may go abroad under your Highness
protection, and that it would please God to grant your Highness such gracious
education, as you may be an happy instrument of his glory in his own good
time, it shall be the fervent suite of

Your Highness humble servant, DAVID BROWN.

The sum of the Authors Profession of EXPEDITION, in teaching to Write.
1 HE teaches those that can read, and be capable and careful, to write any
hand well in six hours, which they never wrote before, or to rectify
whatsoever hand they write already; each one in a several room, and half an
hour at a time.

2 Others also he teaches in so much longer time, as they come short of such
ability, capacity, or using the means: which consists both in earnest
performing their daily half hours task, when they have best leisure between
the times of teaching, and in careful supplying the defect, loss, or neglect
of any one time, by so much the more care and diligence at another time.

3 And those that cannot write at all, or not well, or not true English,
neither can read written hand, write without rule, nor keep accounts, he
teaches to attain all these better in one Month, an hour only in a day, and
as long by their own private practice, (when their affairs may be least
hindered) then they can by others, after the ordinary manner in three, though
they should spend all the day, neglect all other business, and do nothing
else.

All by true and exact method new Rules, and rare secrets of art; authorized by
Supreme Authority; approved by the State, embraced by the Learned, attained by
the Ignorant, and maintained by the Author and Professor, against all opposers
and envyers, strangers and others.

For redeeming the time, and renewing the occasion of learning to all, but
chiefly those of middle age, who have wanted, lost, or neglected either, in
their youth, and cannot now spare long time to learn.

He practices the most part of the day in the Term time, and most of the
after noone in the vacation, at the Cat and Fiddle in Fleet Street, and most of
the forenoone, at his house in S. John's street, next above the Unicorn, except
when he is invited to the Country at any time, especially in the long vacation.

Wh^re likewise Mary Stewart and her daughters, do instru^t young Noble and
Gentlewomen in good manners, languages, writing, and other qualities, by his
assistance and direction.

THE INTRODVCTION to the true understanding of the whole Book.
Showing (as in a prospect) both the probability of Expedition, in teaching,
fair, short, and true writing; and the possibility of learning to write any
hand in six hours.
AS it has pleased our gracious God of his great bounty, for his own glory,
and man's felicity, to prefer man to all his creatures on earth, and to adorn
him with many excellent prerogatives, gifts, and faculties, far above all the
rest, such as wisdom, knowledge, and learning; so likewise he has ordained
all good Arts and Sciences, as special helps and ordinary means whereby he
may attain thereunto, and so much the better, both enjoy a comfortable life
here, and the hope of a happy life hereafter: for as he ever appoints the
end, so he always appoints the means to come to the end.

And since the knowledge and practice of Arts and Sciences, can neither be so
well nor speedily attained, as by using the ordinary means, prescribed by
those whom it has pleased God to raise up and indue with gifts above the rest
in every age; and that by the help or instruction of such as have been most
expert for the time; and those who are expert in these days (now as well as in
former times) are so rare, that they can scarcely be had, but only in some
eminent Cities: and in no Art or Science, are they more rare, then in this of
writing, although it maintains all other Arts and Sciences.

I therefore, not only in consideration of these, and many other motives, but
likewise being further moved by the earnest in treaty of some virtuous minded
men, who now in their age, do far more sensibly feel the want, neglect, or
loss of time in their youth, then many others who are little more careful
yet, than they were then; and so much the rather, in that I apprehend some
measure of ability in my self for their nearest remedy or best recoverie, (as
they are now) have thought it both a part of my duty to him of whom I have it,
and very needful and expedient for the good of all, being the chief end
wherefore I received it, even to offer the same as a benefit to all, and that
by publishing this Book to the view of the world, that ^oth they, and all
others, may make a profitable use thereof.

For it may be, that many hundreths, who are both past the date of (going to
schools) and much employed about other businesses, will yet spare some
convenient time to learn alone, by the help of this Book; whereas (^ither
through distance of place, or other occasions) seare^ly one of them can come to
me, or will go to others: which whosoever reads or practices, I wish it may
be done orderly as it stands, without any omission at all, and as little
intermission as possibly may be, that the scope and substance of all, being
once well conceived in the mind, it may be so much both speedier and better
practiced by the hand.

If either thou that diligently read, or but lightly viewest, or yet any of
you that hear or see this book, be such as neither need, nor intend to
learn; or otherwise, if ye, or any of you be ignorant, and therefore ye
apprehending your own necessities, would feign learn, but want either means
or opportunity; or yet be such as have both great need, and earnest desire, but
too late for you now to begin: I could wish it might please you not to judge or
censure this Book, or benefit offered therein, either as ye are, or shall be
in any of these cases or conditions.

But rather, as if ye your selves, or any of you had either written the one, or
offered the other, or perchance thrice so good as either; and would have me, or
others of better judgment and discretion, to judge or censure those your
works or fruits thereof, and so esteem of you accordingly.

Or, as if Ye were to be learners, and did feel to your great grief now, the
want, loss, or neglect of learning formerly, and could get no other help
(under God) to teach you. Ye were in danger to lose some good design, which if
you could but write a legible hand, you might easily obt^ine. Ye were come to
such age, as you would think it a disparagement to go to school. Your
affairs would not permit, though you would be content to go. You might spare
some little time to learn this way, though no time any other way. Your
children, friends, neighbors, or servants, stood in need of instr^cting.

Or, most of all, I wish ye may judge or censure this Book or benefit, as it
may be profitable to the Church or Common wealth, whereof you are members; for
in that regard, it does also concern you all, in what estate soever you are;
yea, and the more wise or learned you be, I hope you will so much the better
acknowledge, that that which is a benefit to others (by the simpathy of fellow
members) is also a benefit to you: and therefore ye are not only to approve,
but even to maintain also according to your power at all times and occasions,
whatsoever is for the good of others, although neither any of you, not any of
yours at some time or occasion, have any particular need thereof your selves.

But since that which is written, may endure, when the days of the actor, as
well as the time of the action, will expire, who knows but that which I
intend herein may both continue and do good to many one, when neither my hand
can write, nor my tongue speak to any at all? I will therefore take occasion
(howsoever to do my part, and not only now begin whiles I have breath) by the
means of writing, to write the speedy and true way, both of teaching and
learning to write; but likewise use my best endeavors to perform it with all
my power, for there is neither wisdom, work, nor invention in the grave
whither I go; and refer both the continuance and event to God, who only is
eternal, and has the success of all things in his hands.

Whom I humbly beseech so to guide and direct me, both in doing thereof, and
whatsoever thing else I take in hand, that not only I may set his Majesty
always before my eyes, and keep my self in the mean between these two
extremities, even neither to deserve the name of a sluggard, by doing nothing
(at least worth the name of any thing) nor yet to be wise in my own conceit,
in that he has given me some measure of ability and grace to do some thing:
but likewise, that I may always as justly say, as he knows my desire is at
this present, that whatsoever thing he puts in my hands to do, may be done
principally, or much rather, in obedience to him of whom I receive both the
will and the deed; and secondarily, to make the best use thereof I can, both
for my self and others, then any wise to affect singularity, either by the
raritie of the project it self (in thinking it matchless, or that it cannot
be surmatched) or yet so much as by means thereof to claim any perishing
title, prerogative or pre-eminence at all which may not justly be attributed
unto the isntrumental, or any wise derogatorie to the principal efficient of
what is done.

Concerning the elements and contemplations of writing, whereby may be
considered and observed the definitions, derivations, and divisions of the
Art, causes and occasions of the practice: I intend not much to insist in this
first part, neither yet of the excellency of writing in respect of the
renown, necessity, utilitie, raritie, antiquity, universality, and noble
descent thereof; because they are already illustrated in the second part, for
only the principles are briefly expressed here, but the reasons and use of all
largely discussed there.

Therefore, to be short in what I intend to say in this Preface to the
commendation of writing (neither for want of matter nor cause, but rather for
brevitie, and to shun repetition) I hope any of any breeding, will easily
confess, that by the blessing of God upon the ordinary means of writing,
(which it pleased himself, both as our blessed Creator and Redeemer to
practice, and which all Emperors, Kings, Monarchs, Princes, Nobles, and
Gentles must, though they should practice no other art) we have not only his
blessed word written for our learning, that it may be a lantern to our feet,
and a light unto our paths, both to direct us in the way of life, and how to
shun the snares of death,

But likewise thereby all high matters, of whatsoever nature or importance, are
both intended and prosecuted, secret matters are secretly kept, friends that be
a thousand miles distant are conferred with, and (after a sort) visited, the
excellent works of godly men, the grave sentences of wise men, and the
profitable arts of learned men, who died a thousand years ago, are yet extant
for our daily use and imitation; all the estates, kingdoms, cities, and
countries of the world are governed, Laws and Printing maintained, justice and
discipline administered, youth bred in piety, virtue, manners and learning at
schools and Universities, and that which is both most and best, all the
Churches of God from the beginning established, and always unto this day
edified, yea and will be to the end of the world, notwithstanding all and
whatsoever to the contrary is either intented, or can be prosecuted.

But if any should demand how these prerogatives of writing do belong to
Expedition, and exact teaching to write?

I answer, by reasoning thus,

Under the general of every thing, all the specials thereof are included.

But Expedition and exactness of teaching to write, are specials of writing.

Therefore Expedition and exactness of teaching to write, are included under
the general of writing.

The proposition has always been a principle in reason, and therefore is a
thing most evident.

The assumption may be cleared, first thus.

1 If the knowledge, use and benefit of writing be excellent, rare, and
precious, then the teaching thereof must also be so.

But the former is manifest, therefore the latter will follow by true
consequence. Secondly thus:

2 Teaching to write, is useful and commendable, therefore Expedition in
teaching to write, must also be useful and commendable.

The antecedent is already shown, and the consequent plainly follows. And
thirdly,

3 Expedition is very useful and commendable, not only in respect of the
easiness and readiness of teaching and learning by means thereof, But
likewise, of the encouragement of the learners, and that both by sparing their
time and labors; and consequently so much the less hindering their other
affairs, by how much these rules of art and method here professed, be more
exact, easy, and ready then any heretofore either taught or published.

And if any should allege, that many have taught to write both before these
rules were known, and do also teach yet without the knowledge of them, both
speedily and well enough.

To whom also I answer at length, and by occasion thereof do insist in diverse
particulars, which although they may seem also at the first view not to agree,
well enough to the point in hand, yet they do serve greatly for illustration
thereof, and are rather a transition to further probation, then any wise a
digression, which may be as easily proved, as that which is immediately proved,
if need so required.

How many soever do try or essay to do any rare thing, that their action of
trying or essaying, does not prove the speedy nor well-doing of the thing,
(which if I do not (in what I profess) I do nothing) for it is one thing to
do, and another thing to do speedily, and the third thing to do well;
between the first and second, or yet the third, there is many times no less
difference, then between a Master and a Disciple; and all the difference
between what I profess, and that which others do, is that I thus endeavor
to add two words to mine, of which they are negligent in procuring to theirs,
and these are Speedily and well: To the which two words, if I should reduce all
my profession, it would follow by good enough consequence, that that man is
very incapable, that cannot learn from one that is so careful to teach, those
two words in six hours time; yet I have more fully expressed these two in
twelve words, which do contain the substance of all words that can be either
spoken or written for our good, all the letters of the Alphabet, and all the
curious strokes of joining, and that for the speed and ease of all learners;
which therefore if they once can do, they may write what other matter or words
they please, of that hand which they so learn. But to return to our point,
the greatest approbation stands in this that follows, how many soever do a
thing as well as possibly they can, if there be yet one that excels them
all, then will not his doing be so much the more in request, by how many have
tried either before him, or in his days to do it? Whereas if but one or a few
try to do a thing, (as it were) in private, it will be so much the less
respected, by how much it is less known, tried or approved.

We see when a strong man (to try his strength) does throw a double canon
bullet alone, and casts it further at the last, then at the first, does over
match no man, but himself, and not himself neither, because the difference
does consist in the circumstance of time, and not of person, in that he casts
it further at one time then at another, by his further practice, and longer
experiment, for he still remains the same man.

But to draw this point to some further length, if many have tried their
strength and skill before him, yea, and the furthest mark set up by any who
have had the vantguard formerly, whether he or any of all the rest, shall yet
be over reached by some other unexpected, then is his strength and skill
discovered, that tried last, and so much the more both respected and
manifested, by how much he overreached all that have tried since the first.

Moreover, if that wherein any does excel many, and yet not all, be thus
regarded, and that either for some difference of ability, and dexterity in the
doing, or in regard of the time or place of the action, for possibly either
some one or other elsewhere could have matched what was done there at that
time, or else some living in the same place at another time. Then what greater
respect shall be had to any profitable or virtuous work that any one should
both begin and accomplish alone, which none before him in any age or nation
ever so much as imagined?

Herein does singularity most consist, if by any it might be as lawfully
affected, as it is needful by all to be rejected.

I could give many instances, and of diverse sorts, showing how some famous and
rare men in all ages have been excellent in many things above all others in
the age wherein they have lived; some in some things, and others in other
things, yea, and some also in some things, which none either before or after
them have done, (which is correspondent to what was spoken last) but because I
affect brevity, howsoever I be driven against my inclination and disposition,
to the other extremity, (even as well to be on my guard for all opposers, and
to give every one his due, as to satisfy all learners, and to give each one
his part;) I will make choice therefore to speak of those things which have
been in these days, because they are most in remembrance, or best known to
many yet living, most pregnant to our present purpose, most forcible to prove
the possibility of what is intended, and both most probable and credible to all
of this age, since they have all come to pass therein.

Many godly, wise, learned, and valiant men, both English and Scottish, has
Britain brought forth, even in the same age wherein we live, who have excelled
many that have been before them in many ages, whose names were tedious to
express, and their works a thousand fold more tedious to declare in any
competent measure; but both their matchless fame (in those things wherein they
surmatched others) and their magnificke works bear witness of their persons,
who now rest from their labors.

I would gladly begin here at the highest degree, and express both some
particular matter and cause of true and well deserved praise due unto that
state, but especially to a happy and late Possessor thereof, were it not that I
am commanded by modesty to cease, therefore only thus much.

If there were any universal Chronicles royal, the most renowned memory of
King James for his matchless wisdom and learning, might not only be
recorded in great Capital and text lines, with letters both of pure gold, and
perfect silver, but likewise set with rich Diamonds and Pearl, and flourished
in most curious manner, with all colors of ink, before all Kings since the
days of good King Josias; but such a one as I, neither being able in any
measure to express, nor yet any book of this kind worthy to comprehend what
commendation he as Gods instrument (in using of his gifts) deserved, I think
it most expedient to desist, and go to others of inferior degree.

Yet only these few I will name, with their rare and commendable acts so
briefly, as the sufficiency of the matter, and equity of the cause do
require, and as there may be any impression left to the Reader or Hearer
hereof, whereby, if they please, to enquire further of those things, which were
done by these worthy Instruments, whom it pleased God to raise up for his own
glory, and the good of his Church.

Only these five I will name, the first is Master William Perkins, because he
was one of the first in this age, that took extraordinary pains in writing
many excellent and learned Books, both for the benefit and ease of all that
either wrote or taught since, or yet learned for their own us^. And to the
intent he might so much the better perform what he had resolved in this
matter, he did moderate both his diet and sleep according to the shortness
of his time, and necessity of his calling: for he not only (almost every day
of his pilgrimage in this life, after he was any wise enlightened and enabled)
was mavelous diligent and temperate, but likewise in the night time he had a
device tied about his neck, which after he had slept four hours time, gave
him a check, by means whereof he wakened, that (after he had stricken fire)
he might either read, write, pray, or meditate two or three hours, many times
before any of the house (whithersoever he sojourned) went to their businesses.

The second is Master Henry Ainsworth, who both wrote very much, and learnedly,
and lived very modestly: yea and had no more for a long time, but eight pence a
week.

The third is Master George Buchanan; who had the honor to be Tutor to our
late Sovereign Lord King James of famous memory; although many in diverse
nations both before him, and in his days, have tried to translate the Psalms
of David in latin verse, yet never any of their translations were thought
comparable to Buchanans Psalms. And by reason thereof, and of some other rare
works, and that he was so happy an instrument of the breeding of such a
worthy Monarch, whom all the world admired for his wisdom and learning; his
fame is very great among all the godly learned in Europe, and so much the
greater, both because he was a great traveller, and that his books are
dispersed in all nations.

The fourth is Master James Creighton, who being a Baron in Scotland, choosed
rather to travel in foreign nations, and follow his learning, then to stay
at home and enjoy his Patrimony. Concerning whom, though I be somewhat large,
I hope it shall not seem tedious; howsoever many have taken great pains both
to attain learning, and to invent the art of memory (to be a help thereunto
yet this young Noble man was matchless in both, and that not only in his
youth-hood at home, but likewise in all his travels abroad, yea and scarcely
does any history make mention of any the like before him: and besides, which is
no less worthy consideration, it is reported (by men of great worth and
credit, who are yet alive, and knew his education) that he was never taught, at
least after the ordinary manner in studying by book; only he sometimes heard
what was taught to others, and seldom either read or studied, bu^ rather
(besides the appointed times of recreation) he had liberty procured of those
who hearing of his fame, came both far and near to visit and try whether or
not such things were, according to the report, when in the mean time all the
rest of his condisciples were kept in at their studies, and that both when he
was at Schools and Universities.

After he had thus past his course, and came to be made Master of Arts, (as
they are called there) scarcely any could be found to dispute against his
Theses in public. Least they should incur any disgrace before such a learned
auditory, and that from such a young S^holler, for his fame being so spread
throughout all the land, there was a greater assembly of the learned in the
University of S. Andrews at that time, then was either many y^ers before, or
yet since, in the time of any laureation.

Having past his degree^, and ent^ing in his travels, and upon the manifold
experiences which he had of his own ability at home, whither soever he came,
and heard of any public declamation or disputation, there, or any where, he
always addvessed himself thither against the time appointed, if either
distance of place, or other urgent occasions did not hinder him. And amongst
many other places wherein he purchased great commendation, he being once at
Constantinople, (as some do think, and others do allege it was at Padua,
but wheresoever it was, the action is most certain, because it was his
ordinatie practice any where,) and there being a very great assembly of the
most learned of that part of the world, and a most pregnant and rare man having
declamed an excellent Oration, and obtained greater applause then many others
of a long time; Master Creighton (being very attentive before his face all the
while, and unknown almost to any) asked license, although a stranger, to
speak a few words against him who had last spoken, (alleging that that
assembly being like a proclaimed Fair, to which all strangers were invited,
and none exempted, but each one free both to buy such wares as they should
need, and to sell such as they have to spare;) which being granted, he began
thus: This is a very learned man, says he, but he has his learning, as many
have their riches, even by reaping the fruits of other men's labors. If this
has been his practice heretofore, I know not, but one thing I know well, all
that he has spoken now, is that which I was minded to speak, by what means
he has got the copy thereof, I am not yet certain, but to be short, I will
prove that it is mine, and not his, before all this honorable Auditorie, thus:
first, I will repeat all and whatsoever he has spoken, verbatim: secondly,
show him where he failed in such things: thirdly, show how he and all others
may prevent the like error henceforth: and lastly, resume all in a few heads,
and raise some observations thereupon. Which he did at great length according
to the method laid down, and was both heard with far greater attention then
the first speaker, and received ten times greater applause then he did.

The other speaker being astonished and silenced all this time, and yet keeping
his pulpit, which was so much the more grief unto him, by how much he was the
more conspicuous to the eyes of all, his case so suddenly altering, yea and
turning quite contrary to what it was an hour or two before; for the affront
or defeat which he received then, did countervaile all his applause
immediately before.

At length, Master Creighton having finished what he was to speak, and all
the people earnestly looking what issue would come of all these proceedings,
and he perceiving the countenance of the other speaker all the while to be a
little altered, desired him to take courage again, for he would tell him such
good news, as might be a means both to revive his spirit, and restore him to
his former hopes of preferment, yea and also to the favor of all those that
might prefer him, which he did after this manner. He not only confessed
publicly, that the speaker was a very learned man, and worthy of such
promotion as was expected at that time, (which notwithstanding himself might
have had, and far greater too, (both there and in many other places) if he
had either loved preferment for learning, better then learning it self, or yet
the favor of great men, who both loved him so dearly, and respected him so
greatly, that almost they made him their equal wheresoever he went.

But likewise he acknowledged that all which was spoken, was the speakers own
work, and no part thereof his, more then the observations which he in public
made so abruptly by occasion thereof: for it pleased God to give him such an
excellent gift of memory to adorn his learning, that he could hardly forget
any thing whatsoever he either read, saw, or heard; and withal he protested,
that what he did, was not to do harm to any man, nor yet to extenuate or
undervalue any man's gifts, of what measure soever, but rather to encourage, and
do good to all, by offering unto them the benefit of what he received, and
that he might declare what was spoken amiss: which he did so much the rather,
because the same was so far from being perceived by any of the most pregnant
in all that great assembly, that some did approve by their applause, and others
by their silence, even that, as well as any thing that was spoken: for he
considered that things so publicly uttered, ought either to be publicly
approved, by silence, being found good, or (after license given) to be
publicly reproved by contradicting, if they be otherwise; to the intent that
God might be glorified in whatsoever gifts he bestows upon men, and all his
people truly informed by the use thereof in all things, and so none to depart
in doubt of any thing delivered.

Most of his rare works with the times, places, causes, and occasions thereof,
are largely comprehended in the Duke of Manto his records, with whom he spent
most of his days, and in a book dedicated to himself by one Manutius a
learned Italian, who having either conversed with him in his travels, or being
an eye witness to many of his proceedings, gives him greater commendation
then has been given to any, since the days of the Apostles, who had the
extraordinary gifts of the spirit.

The fifth and last is John Naper, who was father to my Lord of Merchiston that
now is: he was reported to be one of the most painful and learned Divines
that has been of any Noble man these many years; and besides many other his
rare works, wherein he was most laborious (even when he was grievously
diseased with the Gout for diverse years together, which is so much the greater
commendation to him, by how much it might have been an excuse to others) he
was one of the first and chiefest in our days that took excessive pains day
and night, to bring the book of the Revelat^on to be so well understood and
taught, as God be praised it is at this day: (for this I know, being his
neighbor a long time at Edenborough, (though I had neither the happiness to
be acquainted with him, nor to be capable of his worth) his candle went never
out (I think) so long as his breath was in,) for he considering the title
thereof to be the R^velation of Jesus Christ, and finding a blessing pronounced
to all those that read, hear, and practice the same, did spend most of his
days in laboring to discover the mystery of that most excellent and profound
Prophecy, that it might be understood in some measure by all unto whom it was
sent, and so much the rather, that as the Holy Spirit is the first love-token
or earnest of our salvation, so the Revelation is the last love-token, that our
Savior has sent to his Church, till he himself return.

By reason whereof, how many soever has written, since Merchiston did write,
and it may be has seen farther then he, which he himself would also have
done, if he had lived longer as well as they, (and which does appear in that
his own last edition, so far excels the first) yet he being such a wise,
learned, and excellent guide, in going before, and pathing (or at least greatly
helping to path) the way (as it were in a morning, throw great heaps of snow)
unto all that have walked since, by his so exquisite labors, even his
paraphrases of this kind, is more worthy (I say) of commendation in that
respect at least, then any who have yet succeeded him, for they have had all
his endeavors to be a light (under God) to them, but he had none of theirs to
help him. And therefore as his name was Na-peir, both after the Scottish
pronuntiation and estimation, so it may be justly called No-peere, according to
the English: It is the fame which he has left, that makes his name to be
great, for he is yet called there, as (I think) he may be to the worlds end,
either here, or any where, Matchless MERCHISTON Mathematitian.

If all the names should be inserted here, of all the famous and valiant men
(such as King Robert Bruce, and Sir William Wallace) with all their matchless
acts, and all the remarkable deeds of others in other ages, who have been
greatly renowned in that most renowned kingdom of Scotland, (which I have the
honor to call the land of my nativitie) and not those few examples in this
age, as well of that, as of this worthy kingdom wherein now I live, chosen for
all, to show that any man is so much the better, yea, and the more to be hoped
and expected of what he can do, in that he has been borne or bred there,
but far more both, doubtless it might fill as great a volume as the Roman
History.

And if it be thus unto such there, it will follow also in time, to be so unto
the like here, and that because they are both of Britain, and so both not
only of one continent, and of one name, but likewise are now both under one
head, and of one Religion, yea and has both one kind of languag^, and one
form of writing, and that which crowns all, they do all strive to love one
another, as they do themselves.

THVS, leaving the commendation of some particular persons, who have excelled
all others in the things whereof they were excellent, I will speak somewhat of
the honor of that renowned kingdom, which chiefly consists in the
prerogatives or privileges thereof, with thy leave and patience, diligent
Reader, and without derogation to any other kingdom, which has either greater
honor or prerogatives, or better privileges of other kinds, or yet is of
greater worth of it self; after I have showed some differences between that
nation, people, and commodities thereof, and others who challenge a higher
place under the pretense of some greater respects: all which although I do, I
hope no judicious man will find that I digress any wise from the point, who
will but consider with me, that whatsoever things are in the way of any thing,
have always some relation to the end thereof, because they lead thereunto,
and that some impe^^ments also must be removed out of the way hereof, which do
greatly hinder the passage to the end, that the work may the more easily
proceed.

For since the probability of the possibility of this task is my part at this
time, I must first use such lawful ordinary means, as I know will make way
unto the performance thereof, and then those, which will fully accomplish the
thing expected. And if it be needful that the end wherefore we aim at any
thing be wished and labored for, by all those who desire that thing, then
doubtless to show both the possibility of attaining, and probability or
certainty of attaining thereof, must also be needful, and that not for the
undertaker alone, but for all who would partake of the benefit as well as he,
and especially those who are either doubtful or mistrustfull, and therefore
slack in using of the means, that they also being in some measure satisfied,
as well as others, may with the more courage, intend, begin, proceed, and
prosecute as well as others.

But although the nature of many things, both spoken, and to be spoken here,
does not agree strictly to writing it self, yet if they be well considered
largely, they do serve greatly both to show the possibility of so speedy
teaching to write, and to make way to the probability thereof, by showing that
there be some men of one kingdom, that be far more generous and compleately
both bred, qualified or gifted, yea and can take greater pains to put all to a
good use, then all those of another kingdom, who are most pregnant in any
faculty of this kind. To the intent it may appear, that from those excellent
prerogatives, which may justly be attributed to the whole kingdom in general,
whereof I am to speak, and especially to the head thereof as the fountain,
there may be some issue of excellency derived to every particular member of
the same, above those who cannot claim unto the like, as both divine and other
histories do specify, what great privilege it was to be a Roman.

And likewise, it is needful that those prerogatives and priviledg^^ be here
expressed for another special respect, yet tending to make way to the same end
and purpose, even for preventing or removing a prejudicate opinion which some
of the vulgar sort, have against the famous kingdom of Scotland, and that
without any ground or reason, insomuch as though one like Solomon should come
forth thereof to this place, yet they were wont more often then now, thus to
demand, Can any good thing come out of Scotland? does it afford this or that?
do such and such things grow there? do any such learned men, or fair writers
live there, as there be here? and many the like idle questions, which be rather
moved for derision, then any wise to require resolution.

1 But all such kind of persons were fully answered, and confuted, both in
those, and in all other such things: for not only it pleased God, that one
like Solomon came out thereof indeed, and removed all such questions, as the
bright sun does expel the misty clouds, and did put to silence all such
persons (at least their impud^ncie and frequ^ncie in those things) and that
both by showing them the contrary of what they pret^nded, or would have had,
and making such a combination between them, and those of whom they spoke, that
the like was never formerly in Britain: so that many of both nations, who were
diversely affected before, have respected others as their own most affectioned
and dear brethren (both at home and abroad) afterward, and for the most part,
ever since? But another also has come forth thereof, God bless him, (like
Josias) who can both repress all such frivolous questions, and redress all
those who will offer to propound them any more.

2 Abundance and variety of all commodities do both come out of Scotland
daily hither, by sea and land, and go every where abroad, (as have always in
all ages) which do manifest the plentiful increase thereof. If some parts of
that land may be called barren, it is but in respect of other parts; even as
the most fruitful kingdom cannot be all alike fruitful; for there was a hill
country in the land of Canaan it self, for bestiall, as well as valley or
daleground for corn^; yea and doubtless there be some special parts also of
it, as good as the best parts of other kingdoms, the value of the commodities
which those parts do afford, being accounted according to the valuation of the
places, where they come to be in greatest request, like as other kingdoms do
with the commodities which they yield.

3. The worthy people of that ancient kingdom, do live with such plenty of
all sorts of things at home amongst themselves, as they need not yield nor give
place, to any people or nation for any thing, more then they need to do unto
them: and therefore although mutual traffic or exchange of commodities be no
disparagement (I hope) but rather a great credit, as well as an advancement to
any people of whatsoever kingdom: yet they could as well (at least) subsist
without the same, (if there were cause, as I hope there shall never be) yea and
live both as contentedly and modestly with their own, as any people in the
world.

If at any time, especially in the years of famine, when it pleases God most
justly to afflict them, as he does their neighbor countries, (either then, or
at other times) they be forced to buy such things as they need, from other
nations, as Gods people of old did of Egypt, they pay them as well for what
they receive, as other nations do when they buy such things (as they need) of
them, upon the like occasions, either of necessity or extremity. And if none
be able to prove any thing to the contrary of those things, then why do not
all acknowledge them to be true?

Whereby (in the mean time as it has been always) it is most evident
(although there were no more to be said) that that kingdom is a most complete
kingdom, and both as plentiful and able to serve the own turn, as any other
kingdom is to serve it self: And therefore no question ought to be made (by
any whosoever) neither of the plenty nor ability thereof, more then of any
other kingdom, neither in sport to maintain table discourse, nor yet in
earnest purpose for curiosity, at other times or occasions.

Those who do enjoy a better land, are bound to be so much the more thankful
to him, who is the true owner of the whole earth, and all that therein is, to
dispose unto what people soever he will; which duty if they do not carefully
discharge, they will be so much the more inexcusable in the day of retribution,
when they are called to account for violent possession thereof: and we are
taught, taught, both by his word and daily experience, as w^ll as by histories,
how often the Monarchies and Kingdoms of the world are translated from one
people unto another, and all through ingratitude and impenitencie.

And whereas it may be thought, that some other kingdoms being more fruitful,
are therefore more able to supply the necessities of that kingdom, then it is
to help them; yet if the variety, extent, and worth of all things which it
sends yearly to other kingdoms, above what any king some sends it, be
well weighed, esteemed, and considered, none of them can surmatch it, yea
scarcely compare with it in any degree, howsoever many do surpass the greater
part of it. But how this defect thereof, in respect of other kingdoms, and yet
the compleatnesse or equality of it with the best of them, can agree in the
general; since only, but some parts thereof, can match the best parts of
them, (and yet nevertheless has as great plenty in the general, both to
serve it self within, and to furnish others without, as any of them) those two
effects do proceed of these two causes (or suppliments two manner of ways)
the one principal, and the other secondarie.

1 The first or principal, does proceed of the blessing of God, which in the
midst of outward poverty, makes riches to increase, as the land of Canaan,
though of it self far inferior to other lands, both in quantity and
fertility, yet so long as his people had their residence there, it did flow
with milk and h^ney, and sustained at one time, eighteen hundred thousand
fighting men, both besides the tribe of Levi, and what it spared also to send
abroad to other nations; yea and all the mighty Kings and Judges thereof in
more sumptuous manner, many times, then any Monarchs ever were before, or
after them.

2 The second, of the virtuous industry of the people of that kingdom, which
may be well compared with the industry of the most excellent people of
whatsoever kingdom (although they have both greater matter whereof, and a
better subject whereon to work.) The first world had almost all things without
labor, which fertile kingdoms do yet imitate, that they may have the more
time to vice, as they had: but the commendable people of the famous kingdom of
Scotland, do surpass all fertile kingdoms in labor and industry, both
early and late, yea and sweating of all the body, as well as the forehead,
according to the ordinance of God, pronounced upon the disobedience of our
first Parents.

In city labor, or artificer work, yea or cosening by trade, they delight
not to be so expert, as some people of other kingdoms are, neither to
maintain unnecessarie trades, or such as any wise tend, or be more inclinable
to vice then virtue, nor to sell slight or counterfeit wares, under color of
good and upright; nor yet are they any wise so bold either to praise their own
wares (at home nor abroad) nor to invite (far less take hold of) customers,
as they pass the streets upon other businesses, to come in, and buy their
wares: but as for the most part, they are every way both more conscionable and
modest, so many of them likewise have all needful things, both as curious, and
far more substantious to sell, unto such only as do offer to buy, then any
others elsewhere.

Their obedience to the true God and Christ whom he has sent, and to their
superiors, with their commendable industry, and conscionable carriage; yea
and their discreet spending on food and apparel, according to their degree
(with other respects which may be gathered from other particulars following)
are the causes, doubtless, that it has pleased God to keep that worthy
native people together, as the true of spring of the first planters of that
land, though always sending multitudes upon all occasions to help other
nations, even unto this day, when almost all the world has turned upside down.

So the matchless industry, srugalitie, care, and labor of that most
virtuous people, is the secondarie cause of their equality of maintenance with
the people of other kingdoms (both to spend and send) or the suppliment of any
defect of fruitfulness in that kingdom.

Which consists rather in careful, diligent, and timely manuring the ground,
(both before and after the sowing of the seed) attending their bestiall, and in
making all kind of cloth, as well linen as woollen; which according to the
commen^able practice both of Bathsheba, the mother of King Solomon, Dorcas, and
other both Noble and religious women, is the laudable exercise also of all the
honorable and grave wom^n, throughout the most part of that kingdom, as well
City as Country, and that to serve their own families, to give unto those
that stand in ne^d, and either to sell at home, or send abroad in exchange for
other wares. But they do not esteem virtue to consist in city industry, yea
or scarcely any thing done with the needle, worthy of the name of work, except
only the making of needful and comely apparel; for howsoever it be thought
by others elsewhere, to be virtuous, yet by them, it is either frivolous or
^idiculous, or for the most part idle or vicious, because it maintains both:
yea and the women there, are so grave, shamefast, and modest, yea and so far
from following new fashions, either by changing with the wind, commonly every
week, or with the Moon surely every month, that they keep the very sur-name
they have of their father, as well as their christen-name, even from their
birth to their death, according to the custom observed, for the most part, in
other nations.

Thus it is apparent by their practice, that these being the three chief, and
most commendable points of civil virtue, are therefore to be embraced, and
all others that are either repugnant, or not agreeable to any of these, neither
are subordinate to serve or maintain all, or any of them, nor yet the actors
or instruments thereof in any respect (spiritually nor civilly) can hardly come
within the compass of laudable virtue; but rather are, (as they always have
been) procuring causes to draw down Gods inevitable judgments upon
Kingdoms, Nations, Countries and Cities.

All virtuous Citizens that do live in a lawful calling, whither they procure
much or little by their honest industry, are hereby commended, in that they
are under these three sorts comprehended; and in a most spec^all manner those
that are most eminent, by their commendable works, as well for the common
wealth, as their own particular or private respects, such as either Master
Sutton, or Master Middleton at London, or Master Heriot at Edinburgh.

And again, as it is said of a strong man, that he can live any where,
according to that Proverb, Omne solum forti patria; so it may be justly said
of Scottish men, that they can live in any part of the world (whither it be
inhabited or not) for as they are both most curious and desirous to travel in
all nations for attaining of languages, manners, and for supplying of
whatsoever defects in their breeding at home, that they may be complete men, as
the land of their nativity, is a complete land; so they are most welcome of any
people, I think in the world, wheresoever they travel or resort, for not only
the nobler or more gentle sort are meet for any rare enterprise of great
worth: But likewise the inferiors are bred either to some Art or profession at
home before they come forth, or to put their hand to any kind of ordinary
work, and to comport with whatsoever kind of entertainment or lodging, yea
and to bear with the dispositions of any kind of people, according to reason
and discretion: whereas those that come short either in all those or most of
them, and yet will travel, would do better to stay at home, and either keep
the Tongs at the fire side, or look to the Geese about the doors.

By consideration of which premises before and after specified, it may be
easily observed, that a plantation of Scottish men in any fertile kingdom,
does far excel so many in number as do come from any other kingdom unto
that soil; as we may easily perceive what great policy, labor and industry,
they of the Scottish nation have made in the north, yea or worst parts of the
kingdom of Ireland, both above the natives, and others of the Southern, best,
and most choicest places of the whole land: if withal we will carefully
account, or duly respect the great difference or inequality of the places. And
by consequence hereof, it may be observed, at least supposed, that if a number
were indifferently chosen, in Scotland, brought forth thence, and placed in any
kingdom more fertile* then it, and as many country men of that kingdom, sent
thither in their places, surely it might be well expected, that the one would
make such a virtuous and honest shift to labor the ground, and live without
any supply at all (but Gods alsufficient providence) whereas it might be
suspected, that the other would starve and die, if they were not both better
and more speedily supplied, then all the industry they could use, whereby to
live.

And to come to an easier and nearer trial, we both see here, and it is known
every where, when any generous, or laborious Scottish man is equally matched to
work, toil, eat, drink, sleep, travel, yea or fight with any such as
himself (by appearance) of any oth^rland, it is ten to one, if he hold not
out, and prevail, when the other shall die or give over; which as it is a
special cause that Scottish men are generally and universally as well accepted
and privileged, as almost the natives of any nation, or at least far better,
then so many such others of whatsoever other nation: so also in that they are
so well beloved every where, is a special encouragement for them to travel,
as some of them always do, since wheresoever they so journe, they are (for
the most part) as duly respected, yea, and upon as reasonable terms, as they
are in far distant parts from their habitati^n, friends, and acquaintance in
their own land.

The ancient Roman privilege, though it went for current in the behalf of all
Romans, throughout all nations, could never in the best time thereof, match
this peculiar passage and general acceptance of Scottish men: for belike, the
Romans did rather claim it as a kind of homage or obedience due unto them, as
being either citizens of Rome, or subjects to the Emperor their head, who had
almost subdued all nations, then as a thing any wise belonging to them, through
their own desert, or good behavior: for we see that what privilege, liberty,
or toleration soever is taken by compulsion, is not comparable to that which
comes freely by deserved love, or is given by tender affection.

I will choose two instances, which are most pregnant to our intended purpose,
in stead of many others of other kinds, which might also be alleged, were it
not for prolixitie, which will both give farther light to this point, and show
that none has any just cause to demand, if there be any learned men, or yet
fair writers in Scotland.

1 The first is, whosoever shall examine the practice of learned Scottish men,
at home, and compare the same with such others abroad, in any foreign nation,
or yet their practice abroad, wheresoever they so journe, and do teach either
old or young, and compare the same with those of that profession, who be
natives in those places, and then they shall see, that if the fruits of their
labors do not surmount all that the natives are able to do, of that
profession in that land, they shall equally match them at least, and besides
give both better attendance, and take greater pains for discharge of
whatsoever duty they undertake to perform, then they, do what they can.

2 And the next is, Scotland is so far from being inferior to any other
kingdom in any thing needful to the common wealth thereof, that it is rather
superior to all kingdoms and nations; for it has such a near relation to
every nation under the sun, that almost there is no commendable art nor
profession any where, but either it, or the like is taught, professed, and
practiced in Scotland, either in Schools or Universities; or else some
Scottish man or other, can compass the way, or find out the means whereby to
attain both to the knowledge and practice of it; howsoever (by the way) I have
heard it often demanded (among other questions) whether or no, there be any
Universities there? but I have answered, twice so many as be here: although it
were as rare, or excellent an Art, as the Phoenix is a bird, (that cannot live
so far north) yet Scotland it self is both as rare, and far more
excellent, yea and has many hundredth years longer subsisted (God be praised)
than ever any Phoenix lived: and as in handling another point by and by shall
be showed, that in several respects, a more excellent and magnifique kingdom
was never.

But in the mean time to end this point, Scotland is so far from yielding to
any other kingdom in any thing, that it will not so much as yield, in so mean
a thing as Writing, (which if I be well remembered, is reckoned in the last
place, among such questions as the common people do usually propound upon all
occasions) saving that through modesty, and entertaining of love, it will
rather give place to many kingdoms, than take it from any kingdom at all.

If any of any kingdom will demand any such question any more, though none of
all the men of Scotland would daine himself to answer it, because it (being
so frivolous) merits no answer, but rather a rebuke, (as I have given to many
of the baser sort, who have both murmured, and taken exception of my Nation,
yea and uttered more, then either I will express, or yet (I think) they would
avow,) if they should be called to give a reason or warrant.

Surely the most rare and curious writs and works of one woman, Esther English
by name, which are extant both in his Majesty's Library at Saint Iameses, and
in the University of Oxford, and in many other places elsewhere, may be
patterns and examples, as well for practice as teaching, both to all the men
and women, professors and others* that either are or have been in Europe these
many years; and yet notwithstanding she would never offer to contend with me
in the practice, let be in the art, but not only gave place very freely, after
some further notice, than she had received at the first, especially of a Noble
man's son of nine years old, whom I had taught to write a number of hands in
most excellent manner, who was therefore brought in before the King, as shall
be showed hereafter: but likewise she ever behaved her self very discreetly to
me, as I always endeavored both to her, and all others in all things
according to my power.

And besides her, there be many excellent Writers in that kingdom, such as
these (which I do specify rather after their age, than either according to
their degree or gifts) Master Alexander Paterson, John Matheson, Charles Geddy,
John Peter, James Clarke, and Hew Wall^ce; some whereof are very exquisite also
in many other hands than be used in Britain: so that in the famous kingdom of
Scotland, whosoever should be so curious as to search, from men endued with
gifts of the highest degree, even unto the lowest, they would both find, that
it is well enough stored with all sorts of learned and excellent men, who
profess all needful and commendable Arts, Sciences, and professions; and that
some thereof are as exquisite, in what they profess, as any of that profession
in any other kingdom or nation.

And therefore the premises being well considered, I hope no exception shall be
any more taken, either of me, or any other of whatsoever degree, in that we
have been borne or bred in that kingdom; for if both I and every one should
pretermit or pass by such assertions, or rather aspertions against the renown
of so worthy and famous a kingdom, which by the right of birth, as well as
other respects, we are bound to defend, then it would quickly follow that each
one would get way, and so consequently in time it might reach very high. And
besides, it is rather a Jewish than Christian opinion, to extenuate the
commendation of any worthy nation; for the Jews undervalued the worthy and
honorable City of Nazaret, in that they made question if any good thing could
come forth thereof, in respect of the other mighty Cities of Judea, wherein
belike they more gloried, then glorified God for enjoying of them.

Then to conclude this point, no prejudicate opinion being any more conceived,
no more exception will be any more taken by any, to extenuate whatsoever any of
that kingdom has, which another of another kingdom has not; and so by this
means and occasion, not only the way being rid of all such impediments, to me
in this mean particular, it may be the more patent to others in a greater
matter: but likewise it being proved by the matchless prerogatives of that
ancient kingdom, that it is in many respects, of incomparable fame, (of which
prerogatives so great a number of valorous Kings and their royal acts,
recorded in so many famous histories, may well be reckoned in the first place,
as shall be done God willing, by and by, and that our dread Sovereign, the
Kings most excellent Majesty, their lineall successor to reign over that most
ancient kingdom, is the most renowned, and famous King in the world.

So, if all these weighty respects be well weighed, and duly considered, it
will follow better thus, then by any other pretended consequence, that there is
rather so much the more to be expected of all Scottish men, even because they
are Scottish men, yea and that they are so much the more also to be respected,
because they have that due and respective honor, title, and prerogative, then
if they were of any other kingdom or nation whatsoever; and that by virtue ^f
the honor and excellency derived from the head to all the body, and so to
every member thereof: therefore this is one of the chief causes, why so many
generous Scottish men in their travels almost any where, save in England,
neither having lands appropriated unto them, whereby to distinguish themselves
from others, of inferior quality, although perchance descended of a worthy
and ancient house, nor yet any title conferred on them, but only the general,
that they be Scottish men, are preferred (both by getting place and
preferment) to many others of other nations, who either have lands or other
titles, (besides the denomination of their country) yea, and sometimes both;
which is a great cause and encouragement for Scottish men to travel, as they
do far more then others.

But this one thing yet remains to be declared, before we proceed to other
matter; it is needful also for the better understanding, and so in some
measure, making up a complete sense) both of what has been said, and is to be
spoken to the commendation of the kingdom of Scotland, even to show in what
respects, it can but compare with the kingdom of England, let be with other
kingdoms, although these so join together, as that they both make but one
continent: yea and do almost lie under one climat and Horizon; which one
example shall suffice to show how Scotland may compare with other kingdoms,
esteeming England in this comparative respect, and many others of other nature,
to be as worthy a kingdom (for the quantity) as any in the world. Therefore I
will use my best endeavors, to make a short d^scription of both these
kingdoms, that the chief cause may both be so much the better, and easier
perceived: for apparently they will be rather found to appear in the different
use of them, according to the several dispositions, opinions, or practices of
the inhabitants of either, then in any correspondencie or equality between
them other wise: which comparison is very worthy observation, especially by
those who would either learn to be good husbands any where, or yet would
confer or examine their own private skill, opinion, or practice, with the
ancient, public, and approved skill, opinion, and practice of those, who have
been both better and longer exercised, in all the several sorts and degrees
of good husbandry.

The kingdom of England is a most excellent, pleasant, and fruitful land,
fairly planted, rarely built, and both well enriched and garnished with all
sorts of commodities, and objects of pleasure, almost like unto France, which
is (thought to be) the garden of the world.

It pleases God, that England yields abundance of increase, in all things
needful for this mortal life, but especially those things most intended (or
best liked) by the inhabitants thereof, which are indeed (for the most part) as
civil, modest, and loving a people, both among themselves, and almost to all
strangers (at home and abroad) yea and as faithful, true, and obedient
subjects to our and their dread Sovereign, as either we, or any other his
Majesty's Subjects, or yet the subjects of any other King, ever were, or can be
to any King, Monarch, or Emperor in all the world.

This fertile kingdom of England, brings forth as great plenty of all sorts
of grain, and of all kind of fruits and herbs, with milk and honey, and all
variety and diversity of other things* both for profit and pleasure, that man's
heart can desire, for the maintenance and refreshment of natural life, I
think as any kingdom whatsoever of the bigness thereof, and so far as it
is sown and labored: for the inhabitants of England, almost ev^r since the
days of Engist, of whom both the land and they do take the name, have thought
it far more easy, and no l^sse profitable, to reserve many of the best, and
most fruitful places of the land, rather for the entertainment of all sorts of
bestiall, which they delight more and more yet to have multiplied, than for the
bearing or increasing of Wheat, Barlie, Pease, or Beans; and therefore the
common people belike, having greater plenty of all kind of fleshes, than of
all sorts of bread, do choose or take occasion to attribute the general name
meat, to flesh, rather than to bread, or any other kind of victuals: whether
they do it, because they have it most, or love it best, or both, is somewhat
questionable, but (notwithstanding all their industry and plenty) one thing is
without all question, it remains as dear as other things: which is somewhat
mitigated, both in their higher valuation of money, and greater plenty thereof,
than Scotland has at this time, because the Court lies there. I need not to
be very prolixe in this description, because I know wherein I am either brief
or deficient, will be well supplied by the natives themselves upon all
occasions, who know their own land better than I, or any other stranger, but
now we are all one.

The kingdom of Scotland, beause it does consist as much in hills, as valleys,
and therefore neither altogether so fruitful as England, nor yet lies so hot
toward the Sun: It is the most healthful or well ayred land to live in, of
any whatsoever, for it has many high and great montains, fair and open
fields, fresh and fierce running wate^s, both clear and wholesome, with
innumerable springs and brooks mingled throughout the whole land.

And that I may be the more brief in describing thereof, if the native form
and fertility of a whole Kingdom may be understood by the like properties of
a Province in another kingdom: then the kingdom of Scotland is most like to
the County of Kent of any part in England, and that in diverse respects, for
though they differ far in quantity; yet not very much in quality, because they
aggree in these three.

Some parts of the realm of Scotland do yield great profit, but little
pleasure, safe only the pleasure which does accompany profit, and these be all
the valleys or valey ground (for the most part through the whole kingdom):
which (in diverse respects) is esteemed either to be better of it self, or else
far better labored, than any of whatsoever kingdom.

Other parts again do yield great pleasure but little profit, and these be,
most of all the hills, banks, moors, and marrishes: for some of these be most
convenient for haulking, and others for hunting, because there be greatest
store of wild foul, and venison in these places,

And some parts are mixed both with all the means, and kinds of profit and
objects of pleasure, and these be, these which do consist partly of hill and
partly of dale ground, and are situated between the sides of all the rivers,
springs, brooks or arms of the seas, and the tops of all the hills, or banks
next adj^cent or adjoying thereunto.

These virtuous inhabitants of that worthy nation do sow and labor all the
parts of the land that may be conveniently sown and labored* and do yield
sufficiency of increase and leave all other parts for grass, hay, woods and
parks, so that by the bl^ssi^g of GOD upon their labors, they have both plenty
of bread and sufficiency of milk and honey, when as people of other countries
(which are both hotter and better, yea and might be easier labored, for want
of laboring) have scarcity.

This comes to pass most usually in dry years (such as both the two last,
and agreat part of this) when the heat of the Sun burns up even the best
g^asse of their fatt^st ground^, which if it had been applied to corn, the
height or length of the stalk or straw thereof would have better borne out
against the drought: so that if these people do not learn of laborious
Scottishmen, and put their hands better to work, they shall have neither bread
nor milk to eat, far less flesh for all their grass.

But although I might insist largly here not only in describing that famous
realm, and the due commendation of the worthy inhabitants thereof, and that
for their excellent qualities, (the like whereof so many, or at least in such
measure no nation has) and these be wisdom, fidelity, magnanimity, learning
industry, frugality liberality, stability, dexterity, c^lerity, and patience:
but likewise a^l the other matchles prop^^ties of that ancient kingdom, which by
divine providence do for the most part flow from those, even as they do from
the fountain of all goodness: but lest the illustration thereof should be
too large I refer the Reader to that Treatise called, The rare prerogatives of
Scotland, and do only express them here as I did the other: return to our
intended matter, and draw it to a conclusion. The prerogatives are these.

1. Scotland was never conquered. 2. It has the greatest succession of Kings.
3. Scottishmen are the most excellent warriors. 4. Scotland is the best
fortifier of other nations. 5. The Roman Emperors wall of defense from the
Scotts. 6. Scottishmen are most compleetly bred and fatthest traveled. 7.
Scotland is an exact abridgment of the whole World. 8 Scotland can best serve
it self without traffic 9. Scotland has the strongest buildings, 10. and the
rarest monuments, both natural and artificial of any cuntrie. 11. and to
crown all the rest, Scotland made the most religious covenant of any nation
since the days of the gospel in the happy reign of King James of blessed
memory.

Thus the the whole premises partly expressed and partly to be understood
being well pondered and considered, is not the ancient kingdom of Scotland
justly esteemed by many, and ought it not to be generally accounted by all,
the most renouned kingdom and so his Majesty the most famous King in all the
World?

And will it not it follow by true consequence that a Scot-sman is so much the
more able to prosecute whatsoever he undertaketh, and therefore so much the
more to be respected by how much he is more ingenuous than one of another
nation?

And why then, is there any more prejudicate opinion taken by any of me in my
profession, but rather the possibility thereof more trusted, and the
probability more expected, than if I were one of another nation?

Now I with this little bark being arrived at the haven unto which I intended,
and after she and I have both been driven so far out of the way beyond all
expectation at the first, and endured so great dangers not only of strong men
of war: and contrary winds, but have past through so many difficulties both of
rocks and quick sands, I proceed where I left.

Howsoever this task of teaching to write in six hours may seem either to be
hard or impossible, because it is rare or more than ordinary, yet it is
effected by ordinary means through Gods assistance, unto whom all good things
are possible, whether they be rare or frequent, and who gives the success to
every thing he sees good, not withstanding all and whatsoever impediments
which any way do cross his good purpose.

And that it has pleased him (who is the ^fficient cause of all goodness) first
to grant me the knowledge, next the practice, and thirdly the dexterity even to
do good to others as well as my self by both: and fourthly to assist me in that
profession hitherto, I prove at large in the first part of this work, or Art of
Expedition, and that by the manifold effects both of what I (by his assistance)
have formerly done, and now profess to do.

Which if any do distrust, or think still imp^ssible (although very probable) I
hope if they will but believe their own eyes even by present ptactise, to give
them such content, as henceforth they shall have no reason but to be silent.

Although the time prescribed be only six hours, yet I do neither exclude
longer time, as well for attaining further perfection of degries and celerity or
speed, by much and often practice after, as due theorie, true way or perfection
of parts both of skill and speed by dexterity or rational knowledge thereof.

Neither yet do I prescribe so strict or short a time to accomplish this
business as a precise task to all alike, because all are neither alike capable
to learn, nor alike careful to practice nor yet to practice alike carefully
nor constantly what they learn, yea even although they be men of age, learning
and discretion, and have time and opportunity.

And although all that do learn of one teacher may be alike equally taught,
yet all cannot be alike speedily taught, because all cannot alike speedily
learn; therefore some must have longer time than others, not in their teachers
default, for he can teach them as soon as others, but in their own, who
cannot learn so speedily as others, yea and although they could, yet if they
be either not so careful to practice, or that they do practice not so
carefully and constantly as others, they will come so much shorter of their
intent, and so will require so much longer time than others.

Do not both many of us see by daily practice, and some of us feel by
doleful experience, that although painful Preachers do never so equaly deliver
Gods word to al their auditors, yet ^hey cannot teach them all alike spedily,
because they cannot all learn alike speedily, neither though they could, are
they all alike careful to practice, and far less to do it alike carefully,
and constantly, and so in these things stands all the difference.

Whereby it is evident that although writing be never so equally taught to
many, and well learned by some, yet it is only kept by those who practice it,
and that both carefully and constantly: at least half an hour in a day, till
they have it perfectly.

Therefore, as there is great difference as well between teachers and learners
thereof as of other things, and sometimes defects on each side for want either
of skill or care, if not of both, so there is great difference also between
le^^ners through the same defects: as the Sun shining on diverse objects makes
diversity of effects.
