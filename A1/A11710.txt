Royal coat of arms
CHARLES by the grace of God, King of Scotland, England, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith.
To our Lovits Heralds, pursevants, our sheriffs in that part conjunctly and
severally specially constitute, greeting.
Forsameikle as out of the royal and fatherly care which we have had of the
good and peace of this our ancient and native kingdom, having taken to our
serious consideration all such things as might have given contentment to our
good and loyal subjects: and to this end had discharged by our proclamation
the service book, book of canons, and high commission, freed and liberate all
men from the practicing of the five articles, made all our subjects both
ecclesiastical and civil liable to the censure of Parliament, general
Assembly, or any other judicatorie competent, according to the nature and
quality of the offense: and for the free entry of ministers, that no other
oath be administrate unto them then that which is contained in the act of
parliament: had declared all bygone disorders absolutely forgotten and
forgiven: and for the more full and clear extirpating all ground and occasion
of fears of innovation of religion, we had commanded the confession of faith,
and band for maintenance thereof, and of authority in defense of the same,
subscribed by our dear Father, and his household, in anno 1580. to be renewed
and subscribed again by our subjects here: Like as for settling of a perfect
peace in the church and commonwealth of this kingdom, we caused indict a free
general assembly to be holden at Glasgow the xxi. of this instant, and
thereafter a parliament in May, 1639. By which clement dealing, we looked
assuredly to have reduced our subjects to their former quiet behavior and
dutiful carriage, whereto they are bound by the word of God, and laws both
national and municipall, to us their native and sovereign prince. And albeit
the wished effects did not follow, but by the contrary, by our so gracious
procedure they were rather emboldened, not only to continue in their stubborn
and unlawful ways, but also daily add to their former procedures acts of
neglect, and contempt of authority, as evidently appeared by open opposing of
our just and religious pleasure and command, expressed in our last proclamation
anent the discharge of the service book, book of canons, high commission, etc.
protesting against the same, and striving by many indirect means to withdraw
the hearts of our good people, not only from a hearty acknowledgement of our
gracious dealing with them, but also from the due obedience to those our just
and religious commands, notwithstanding we had been formerly so often petitioned
by themselves for the same. By their daily and hourly guarding and watching
about our Castle of Edinburgh, suffering nothing to be imported therein, but at
their discretion, And openly stopping and impeding any importation of
ammunition, or other necessaries whatsoever to any other of our houses within
that kingdom: Denying to us their sovereign Lord that liberty and freedom,
which the meanest of them assume to themselves (an act without precedent or
example in the Christian world) By making of convocations and council tables
of Nobility, Gentry, Burrows and Ministers within the city of Edinburgh,
where not regarding the laws of the kingdom, they without warrant of
authority conveene, assemble, and treat upon matters, as well ecclesiastical
as civil, send their injunctions and directions throughout the country to
their subordinate tables, and other under ministers appointed by them for that
effect. And under color and pretext of religion exercing an unwarranted and
unbounded liberty, require obedience to their illegal and unlawful
procedures and directions, to the great and seen prejudice of authority, and
lawful monarchical government. And notwithstanding it was evidently manifest
by the illegal and unformall course taken in the election of their
commissioners for the assembly, whereof some are under the censure of this
church, some under the censure of the church of Ireland, and some long since
banished for open and avowed teaching against monarchy, others of them
suspended, and some admitted to the ministry contrary to the form prescribed
by the laws of this kingdom, others of them a long time since denounced
rebels, and put to the horn, who by all law and unviolable custom and
practique of this kingdom, are, and ever have been incapable, either to
pursue, or defend before any judicatorie, far less to be judges themselves;
some of them confined, and all of them by oath and subscription bound to the
overthrow of episcopacie. And by this and other their underhand working, and
private informations and persuasions, have given just ground of suspicion of
their partiality herein, and so made themselves unfit judges of what
concerns episcopacie. And als it was sufficiently cleared by the peremptory
and illegal procedures of the presbyteries, who at their own hand by order of
law, and without due form of process, thrust out the moderators lawfully
established, and placed others, whom they found most inclinable to their
turbulent humors, associate to themselves for the choosing of the said
commissioners for the assembly, a laick elder out of each paroch, who being in
most places equal, if not more in number then the ministry, made choice both
of the ministers, who should be commissioners from the presbyteries, as also of
a ruling elder, being directed more therein by the warrants from the foresaid
pretended tables, then by their own judgments, as appears by the several
private instructions sent from them, far contrary to the laws of the country,
and lowable custom of the church: by which doings it is too manifest, that no
calm nor peaceable procedure or course could have been expected from this
assembly, for settling of the present disorders and distractions. Yet we were
pleased herein in some sort to blinde-fold our own judgment, and overlook the
said disorders, and patiently to attend the meeting of the said assembly,
still hoping that when they were met together, by our Commissioner his
presence, and assistance of such other well disposed subjects who were to be
there, and by their own seeing the real performance of all that was promised
by our last proclamation, they should have been induced to return to their due
obedience of subjects: But perceiving that their seditious disposition still
increases, by their repairing to the said assembly with great bands and troops
of men, all boddin in fear of war, with guns and pistolets, contrary to the
laws of this kingdom, custom observed in all assemblies, and in high
contempt of our last proclamation at Edinburgh the xvi. of this instant: as
also by their peremptory refusing of our assessors, authorized by us (although
fewer in number then our dearest father was in use to have at diverse
assemblies) the power of voting in this assembly, as formerly they have done in
other assemblies; and by their partial, unjust and unchristian refusing, and
not suffering to be read the reasons and arguments given in by the Bishops, and
their adherents to our Commissioner, why the assembly ought not to proceed to
the election of a moderator without them, neither yet to the admitting of any
of the commissioners of the said commissioners from presbyteries, before they
were heard object against the same, though earnestly required by our
Commissioner in our name. And notwithstanding that our Commissioner under his
hand, by warrant from us, gave in a sufficient declaration of all that was
contained in our late proclamation and declaration, the same bearing likewise
our pleasure of the registration of the same in the books of assembly for the
full assurance of the true religion to all our good subjects; And yet not
resting satisfied therewith, lest the continuance of their meeting together
might produce other the like dangerous acts, derogatorie to royal authority,
we have thought good, for preveening thereof, and for the whole causes and
reasons abovementioned, and diverse others importing the true monarchical
government of this estate, to dissolve and break up the said assembly. And
therefore

OUR WILL is, and we do discharge and inhibit all and whatsoever pretended
commissioners, and other members of the said pretended assembly, of all further
meeting and conveening, treating and concluding any thing belonging to the said
assembly, under the pain of treason, declaring all and whatsoever that they
shall happen to do in any pretended meeting thereafter, to be null, of no
strength, force nor effect, with all that may follow thereupon: Prohibiting and
discharging all our lieges to give obedience thereto, and declaring them, and
every one of them, free and exempt from the same, and of all hazard that may
ensue for not obeying thereof. And for this effect we command and charge all
the foresaids pretended commissioners, and other members of the said assembly,
to depart forth of this city of Glasgow within the space of xxiiii* hours
after the publication hereof, and to repair home to their own houses, or that
they go about their own private affairs in a quiet manner. With special
provision always, that the foresaid declaration, given in under our
Commissioners hand, with all therein contained, shall notwithstanding hereof
stand full, firm and sure to all our good subjects in all time coming, for the
full assurance to them of the true religion. And our will is, and we command
and charge, that incontinent these our letters seen, ye pass, and make
publication hereof by open proclamation at the market cross of Glasgow, and
other places needful, wherethrough none pretend ignorance of the same.

Given under our signet at Glasgow the 29. of November, and of our reign the
fourteenth year. 1638. Sic subscribitur HAMMILTOVN, Traquaire, Roxburgh Murray,
