CANZONETS

TO THREE VOICES NEWLY COMPOSED BY HENRY YOVLL PRACTICIONER IN THE ART OF
MUSIC.

IN LONDON PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE, the assign of William Barley.

CANTVS.

To the virtuous Gentlemen Mr. Nicholas Bacon, Mr. Phillip Bacon, Mr.
Nathaniell Bacon, and Mr. Lionell Bacon, Sons to the Worshipful Mr. Edward
Bacon Esquire, Henry Youll wishes all happiness both here and hereafter.
COurteous Gentlemen, these Canzonets of mine being ended, according as my
ability therein and the leisure allotted me from other necessary employments
would permit, as now, so long since willingly would they have offered
themselves unto you to be patronized of you, had not the manifold rubs which
befell them in their way stayed them hitherto; better now then never. The
action it self of impropriating the first fruits of your protection may
perhaps at the first blush seem to be of great boldness, but to an
indifferent censurer upon mature deliberation, the trespass of it will easily
appear to be but Ueniall if any. For what Advocate is there (though but
tasted of the rudiments of Law) who could not plead a reasonable excuse for
it, if he were but informed of your industrious travailing in the liberal
Sciences (whereof Music is one) with such willingness of mind and delight
of heart and with such an ingenious disposition of liking and loving all whose
footsteps do tend the same way with you. And yet that is not all. For these
Sonnets of mine, if you mark them well, do seem to smile upon you, as
challenging some former familier acquaintance with you. And I dare say for
them, that if they knew how, they would courteously salute you, and merrily
relate what a solace their company was once to you, when as being but weak
ones I nursed them amongst you. But if all this were not, yet your loving
affections and bountiful kindness, which both your worshipful Parents and
your selves, have from time to time enlarged toward me, might well enough
animate me in craving your favorable protection, for whom can a man better
trust to, then those of whom he has had former trial. Accept therefore I pray
you, of these first fruits of my endeavors, accounting it no impeachment to any
of you, that so small a thing is made common to all of you, you are I trust
children of the most High, and therefore tied together by the band of the
Spirit, you are all Brethren of the same Parents, and therefore tied together
by the band of Nature: your education formerly has been for the most part
together, and your place of residence is now in one and the same University,
as in a Nursery, and in one and the same place of that Nursery, and therefore
you are tied together by the band of Society: far be it from me, that I
should seem to go about to separate where they are so worthily knit together.
The Lord knit you still surer and surer in love toward his Majesty, and one
toward another, that you may so live together on earth, as that one day you
may be crowned together with glory in heaven.

Yours in all duty to his power Henry Youll.

CANZONETS

TO THREE VOICES NEWLY COMPOSED BY HENRY YOVLL PRACTICIONER IN THE ART OF
MUSIC.

1608

IN LONDON PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE, the assign of William Barley.

BASSVS.

To the virtuous Gentlemen Mr. Nicholas Bacon, Mr. Phillip Bacon, Mr.
Nathaniell Bacon, and Mr. Lionell Bacon, Sons to the Worshipful Mr. Edward
Bacon Esquire, Henry Youll wishes all happiness both here and hereafter.
COurteous Gentlemen, these Canzonets of mine being ended, according as my
ability therein and the leisure allotted me from other necessary employments
would permit, as now, so long since willingly would they have offered
themselves unto you to be patronized of you, had not the manifold rubs which
befell them in their way stayed them hitherto; better now then never. The
action it self of impropriating the first fruits of your protection may
perhaps at the first blush seem to be of great boldness, but to an
indifferent censurer upon mature deliberation, the trespass of it will easily
appear to be but Ueniall if any. For what Advocate is there (though but
tasted of the rudiments of Law) who could not plead a reasonable excuse for
it, if he were but informed of your industrious travailing in the liberal
Sciences (whereof Music is one) with such willingness of mind and delight
of heart and with such an ingenious disposition of liking and loving all whose
footsteps do tend the same way with you. And yet that is not all. For these
Sonnets of mine, if you mark them well, do seem to smile upon you, as
challenging some former familier acquaintance with you. And I dare say for
them, that if they knew how, they would courteously salute you, and merrily
relate what a solace their company was once to you, when as being but weak
ones I nursed them amongst you. `But if all this were not, yet your loving
affections and bountiful kindness, which both your worshipful Parents and
your selves, have from time to time enlarged toward me, might well enough
animate me in craving your favorable protection, for whom can a man better
trust to, then those of whom he has had former trial. Accept therefore I pray
you, of these first fruits of my endeavors, accounting it no impeachment to any
of you, that so small a thing is made common to all of you, you are I trust
children of the most High, and therefore tied together by the band of the
Spirit, you are all Brethren of the same Parents, and therefore tied together
by the band of Nature: your education formerly has been for the most part
together, and your place of residence is now in one and the same University,
as in a Nursery, and in one and the same place of that Nursery, and therefore
you are tied together by the band of Society: far be it from me, that I
should seem to go about to separate where they are so worthily knit together.
The Lord knit you still surer and surer in love toward his Majesty, and one
toward another, that you may so live together on earth, as that one day you
may be crowned together with glory in heaven.

Yours in all duty to his power Henry Youll.
