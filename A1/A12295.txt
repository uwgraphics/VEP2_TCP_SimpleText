These frantyke foolys I hate most of all.
For though they stu^ble in the synnys seuyn.
In peuyshnes yet the snapper and fall.

This peuysh proud this prender gest.
when he is well yet can he not rest.
A sweet sugar lofe and sour bayardys bun
Ar sumdele like in form and shap.
The one for a duke the other for dun.
A maunchet for morell thereon to snap.

But for in his gam vt carp that he can.

Of Martyn swart and all his merry men.
Lord how perkyn is proud of his Pohen.
But ask where he fyndyth among his monacordys.
An holy water clarke a ruler of lordys.
He can not find it in rule nor in space.
He solfyth to haute his Trybyll is to hy.
He braggyth of his birth that borne was full bace

his dyscant is besy it is without a mean.
To fat is his fantsy his wit is to lene.
He lumbryth on a lewd lewte roty bully Joy.
Rumbyll down tumbyll down hey go now now.
He fumblyth in his fyngeryng an ugly good noise.

A red angry man but easy to intrete.
An vssher of the hall fayn would I get.
To point this proud page a place and a rome
For Iak would be a Ientylman that late was a grome
Iak would Iet and yet Iyll said nay.

A malaperte medler that pryeth for his pray
In a dysh dare he rush at the rypest.
Dremyng in dumpys to wrangyll and to wrest.
he fyndeth a proporcyon in his prycke song.
To drynk at a draught a larg and a long
Nay iape not with him he is no small fool
It is a solemn sire and a solayne.
For lords and ladies learn at his scole
he techyth them so wisely to solf and to feign
That neither they sing well prycke song nor plain
This docter deuyas commensyd in a cart.

My mind has brokyn.
From worldly lust.
For I have dyscust.
we are but dust.
And die we must.
It is general.
To be mortal.
I have well espyde.
No man may him hyde.
From death holow eyed.
with sin ws wyderyd.
with bonys shyderyd.
with his worm etyn maw.
And his ghastly Iaw.
Gaspyng aside.
Nakyd of hyde.
Neither flesh nor fell.
Then by my council.

well this gospel.
for where so we dwell.
Death will us quell.
And with us mell.
For all our pamperde pau^chys.
There may no fraunchys.
Nor worldly blys.
Redeem us from this.
Our days be datyd.
To be chek matyd.
With drawttys of death.
Stoppyng our breath.
Our eyes synkyng.
Our bodies stynkyng.
Our gummys grynnyng.
Our soulys brynnyng.
To whom then shall we sew.
For to have rescew.
But to sweet Jesus.
On us then for to rue.
O goodly child.
Of Mary mylde.
Then be our shylde.
That we be not exylyd.
To the dyne dale.
of boteles bale.
Nor to the lake.
of fendys blake.
But grant us grace
To se thy face.
And to purchase
Thine heavenly place.
And thy palace.
Full of solace.
Above the sky.
That is so hy.
Eternally.
To behold and se.
The Trynyte.
Amen.

To praise your port it is nedeles.
For all your draffe yet and your dreggys.
As well borne as ye full often time beggys.

Mine horse is sold I wene you say.
My new furryd gown when it is worn.
Put up your purs ye shall non pay.
By Creed I trust to se the day.
As proud a pohen as ye sprede.
Of me and other ye may have need.
Though angelyk be your smylyng.
yet is your tongue an adders tail.
Full like a Scorpyon styngyng.
All those by whom ye have avail.
Good mastres Anne there ye do shayle.

Nor stand long wrestyng there about.
Of your doregate ye have no doubt.
But one thing is that ye be lewd.
Hold your tongue now all be shrewde.
To mastres Anne that farly sweet.
That wonnes at the key in temmys street.
