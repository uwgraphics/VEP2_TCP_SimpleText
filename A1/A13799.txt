Fair fall all good Tokens. OR, A pleasant new Song not common to be had,
Which will teach you to know good tokens from bad. To a pleasant new tune.
TO you that have bad tokens,
this matter I indight,
Yet nothing shall be spoken,
that shall your minds afright:
Be silent therefore and stand still,
mark what proceeds from my Quill:
I speak of tokens good and ill,
and such as are not right.
But first I Will have you understand,
before that I do pass,
That there are many tokens
which are not made of brass,
It is a token of my love,
that I to you this matter move;
For many tokens bad do prove,
we see in every place.
Yet by all signs and tokens,
as I may judge or think,
The man that has lost both his eyes,
he cannot choose but wink;
But some will wink when they may see,
but that is nothing unto me:
Some shut their eyes to have a fee,
which are in love with chinke.
He that has gained much silver,
and does possess much gold,
It Is a token that he shall be rich,
if he his substance hold:
But he that has but little store,
and spends all and something more,
It Is a token that he shall dye poor,
to say it you may be bold.
He that is a very fool,
and wisdom does despise,
It Is a token that he shall be old
if he live till he be wise:
And he that has great store of wit,
and makes no right use of it,
It Is a token that he is unfit
in honor to arise.
But this is a bad token,
mark well what I shall say:
When a young man has a handsome wife
and lets her run astray,
It is a token she will be naught,
and quickly unto lewdness brought,
If that she be no better taught,
she will bring him to decay.
The second part, To the same tune.
He that has a fiery nose,
which looks like Claret red;
It Is a token then he does consume
in drink more then in bread:
For if his nose be fiery hot,
it is a token that he loves the pot:
He hates small drink and loves it not,
he has not so been fed.
Then fair fall all good tokens,
now it comes into mind:
Mark which way sits the Wether-cocke,
and that way blows the wind:
Mark which w^y rowles a Wantons eye,
and something you may see thereby;
Or if you please then you may try,
and so the trut^ ^^y find.
He that has lived in wickedness,
and does in vice, remain,
It is a token he has no care
to free his soul from pain:
When Conscience does on Crutches creep
its a token Truth is lulld asleep,
Which makes poor men in dangers deep
to call and cry in vain.
But this is a token of a truth,
which does betoken ill:
An angry wife will work much woe,
but she will have her will:
For if she chance to bend her browe,
or seem to look I know not how
It Is a token she will scold I vow,
her tongue will not lie still.
But this is a true token,
then mark my word aright:
When Sol is setting in the West
the world will lose her light.
So when an old man's head grows gray,
he may think on his dying day:
For to the grave he must away
and bid the world good night.
He that has a wandering eye,
and loves lewd women dear,
It Is a token that heel prove a knave:
Bust I Will tell you in your ear
For sure you never saw the like
a Soldier loves to toss a pike:
The Capster draws but dares not striks
which does betoken fear.
Then fair fall all good tokens
and well fare a good heart:
For by all signs and tokens
it is time for to depart:
And now it is time to end my song
I hope I have done no man wrong:
For he that cannot rule his tongue
shall feel a greater smart.
FINIS.
