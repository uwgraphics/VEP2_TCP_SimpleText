A path way i^to the holy scripture.

A pathwaye into holy. etc.
I Do ma^ueyle greatly / derely beloved in Christ / that ever any man should
repugne or speak against the scripture to be had in every language / and that
of every man. For I thought that no man had been so blind to ask why light
should be showed to them that walk in darkness / where they can not but stomble
/ and where to stomble is the danger of eternal dampnacion: either so
dispytefull that he would envy any man (I speak not his brother) so necessary
a thing: or so bedlem mad to afferme that good is the natural cause of evil /
and darkness to proceed out of light / and that lyeng should be grounded in
troth and verytie / and not rather clean contrary that light distroyeth
darkness / and veritye reproves all manner lyenge.

Nevertheless / seeing that it has pleased god to send unto our English
men / even to as many as unfeignedly desire it / the scripture in their mother
tongue / considering that there be in every place false techers and blind
leders / that ye should be disceyued of no man. I supposed it very necessary to
prepayre this Path way into the scripture for you that ye might walk surely
and ever know the true from the false. And above al to put you in remembrance
of certain points which are: That ye well understand what these words mean.
The old Testament / the new Testament / the law / the gospel / Moses /
Christ / nature / grace / workyng and beleuyng / deeds and faith. L^^t we
ascrybe to the one / that which belongs to the other / and make of Christ /
Moses / of the gospel / the law: dispyse grace and rob faith: and fall from
meke learning in to idle dispicyons / braulynge and scoldinge about words. The
old testament is a book wherein is written the law of god / and the deeds of
them which fulfill them / and of them also which fulfill them not.

The new Testament is a book / wherein are contained the promyses of god / and
the deeds of them which believe them / or believe them not.

Eua^gelion (that we call the gospel) is a greek word / and sygnifyeth good
merry / glad / and joyful tidings / that makes a man's heart glad / and
makes him sing / dance / and leap for joy. As wha^ David had killed Go
lyath the giau^t / came glad tidinges unto the jews / that their fearful and
cruel enemy was slain / and they delivered out of all danger: for gladness
whereof they so^ge / dau^sed and were joyful. In like manner is the euangelion of
god (which we call gospel and the new testament) joyful tidings and as some
say: A good herynge publysshed by the apostels through out all the world /
of Christ the right Dauyd / how that he has fought with sin / with death
/ and the devil / and overcome them.

Whereby all men that were in bondage to sin wounded with death / overcome of
the Devil / are without their own meryttes or deservings / losed /
justified / restored to life / and saved / brought to liberty and reconsyled
unto the favor of god and set at one with him again which tidings as many
as believe laud / praise / and thank god / are glad / sing / dance for joy.

This Euangelyon or Gospel (that is to say / such joyful tidings) is
called the new Testament. Because that as a man when he shall dye / appoynteth
his goods to be delte and distributed after his death among them which he
names to be his heirs. Even so Christ before his death commanded and
appointed that such Euangelyon / Gospel or tidings / should be declared
throughoute all the world / and therewith to give unto all that repent and
believe / all his goods: that is to say / his life / wherewith he swalowed and
devoured up death his rightwysnesse / wherewith he banysshed sin: his salvation
/ wherewith he overcame eternal dampnacyon. Now can the wretched man (that
knows him self to be wrapped in syn / and in danger to death and Hell) here
no more ioyouse a thing / than such glad and comfortable tidings of Christ
/ so that he can not but be glad and laugh from the low bottom of his heart
/ if he believe that the tidings are true.

To strength such faith with all / god promised this his euangelyon in the old
testameut by the prophets (as Paul says in the first chapter unto ye
Romans) How that he was chosen out to preche gods Euangelion / which he
before had promised by the prophets in the holy scriptures that treat of his
son which was borne of the sede of Dauyd. In the third chapter of Genesis /
god says to the serpente: I will put hatered between the and the woman /
between thy seed and her sede: that self sede shall tread thy heed under
foot, Christ is the woman's sede / he it is that has trodden under foot the
deuyls heed / that is to say: sin / death / hell / and all his power. For
without this sede can no man avoid sin / death / hell / and everlasting
dampnacion. Again / Gene. xxii. God promised Abraham / saying. In thy sede
shall all the generacyons of the earth be blessed. Christ is that sede of
Abraham / says s. Paul in the third to the Galathyans. He has blessed all the
world through the Gospel. For where Christ is not / there remains the
curse that fell on Adam / as soon as he had sinned / so that they are in
bondage under the dampnacyon of sin / death / and hell. Against this curse
blesses now the gospel all the world / in as much as it cries openly unto
all that knowledge their sins and repent / saying: Who so ever believes on
the sede of Abraham shall be blessed / that is / he shall be delivered from sin
/ death and hell / and shall hence forth contynewe ^ightwyse and saved for ever
/ as Christ him self says (in the. xi. of Johan.) He that believed on me shall
never more dye.

The law (says Jo. in the first ^ha) was given by Moses: but grace and virtue
by Jesus Christ. The law (whose minyster is Moses) was given to bring us unto
the knowledge of our selves / that we might thereby feel and perceive what we
are of nature, The law condemns us and all our deeds / and is called of
Paul (in the third cha. of the. ii. pistle unto the corinthians) the
mynistracyon of death. For it kylleth our conscyences and drweth us to
disperacyon / in as much as it requires of us / that which is impossible for
our nature to do. It requires of us the deeds of an hole man. It requires
perfet love from the low bottom and ground of the heart / as well in all
things which we suffer as in tho thiges which we do. But says John^ in the
same place* grace and veritye is given us by Christ / so that wha^ the law
has passed upon us / and condemned us to death (which is his nature to do)
than have we in Christ grace / that is to say favor / promyses of life / of
mercy / of pardone / freely by the merytes of Christ / and in Christ have we
veritye and troth / in that god for his sake fulfylleth all his promyses to
them that believe. Therefore is the gospel the ministracion of life. Paul
calls it in the fore rehearsed place of ye second ^^ap. to the Corinthia^s.
the ministracion of the spirit*and of rightwysnes. In the gospel when we be
leave the promyses / we receive the spirit of life / and are justified in the
blood of Christ from all things whereof the law condempneth us. And we
receive love unto the law and power to fulfill it / and grow therein daily. Of
Christ it is written in the fore ^^hersed first chapter of John: this is he
of whose abundance or fulness / all we have received grace for grace / or favor
for favor. That is to say / for the favor that god has to his son christ /
he gives unto us his favor and good will / and al gifts of his grace / as a
fader to his sons. As affermeth Paul / saying: which loved us in his
beloved before the creatyon of the world. So that Christ brings the love of
god unto us / and not our own holy works. Christ is made lord over all /
and is called in scripture / gods mercy stole. whosoever therefore flies to
christ / can neither here nor receive of god any other thing save In the old
testament (mercy. ar many promises / which are nothing else but this euangelyon
or gospel / to save those that believed the^ / from the vengeance of the law.
And in the new testament is often made mention of the law / to condemn the^ /
which believe not the promyses.

Moreover the law and gospel may never be separate: for the gospel and
promyses serve but for troubled couscyences which are brought to disperacion
and feel the pains of hell and death under the law / and are in captiuyte and
bondage under the law. In all my deeds I must have the law before me to
condemn mine vnperfytnes. For all that I do (be I never so parfyte) is yet
dampnable sin / when it is compared to the law / which requires the ground
and bottom of mine heart. I must therefore have always the law in my sight /
that I may be meke i^ the spirit / and give god all the laud and praise /
ascribi^ge to hi^ all rightwysnes / and to my self all unright wysenes and
sin. I must also have the promyses before mine eyes / that I dispeyre not /
in which promise I se the mercy / favor / and good will of god upon me in the
blood of his son christ / which has made satisfaction for mine vnparfytenes
/ and fulfilled for me / that which I could not do, Here may ye perceive that
two manner of people are sore disceyued. First they which iustifye them self
with outward deeds / in that they absteyne outwardly from that which the law
forbyddeth / and do outwardly that which the law commands. They compare
themselves to open sinners / and in respect of them justify the^ selves /
condempnynge the open sinners. They set a veil on Moses face / and se not how
the law requires love from the botthom of the heart / and that love only is
the fulfyllynge of the law. If they did they would not condemn their
neybours. Love hydeth the multy tude of sins says saint Peter in his first
Pistle. For whom I love from the deep bothom and ground of mine heart / him
condemn I not / neither reken his sins / but suffer his wekenesse and
infyrmyte / as a mother the wekenesse of her son / until he grow up into a
parfyte man. Those also are disceyued which without all fear of god give them
selves unto all manner vices with full consent / and full delectacion / having
no respect to the law of god (under whose vengeance they are locked up in
captiuytie) but say: God is merciful / and Christ dyed for us / supposing
that such dremynge and ymaginacion is that faith which is so greatly commended
in holy scripture. Nay / that is not faith but rather a folysshe blind
opinyon / springynge of their own corrupt nature / and is not given them of
the spirit of god / but rather of the spirit of the devil / whose faith now a
days / the popysshe compare and make equal unto the best trust / confidence
and believe / that a repenting soul can have in the blood of our savior Jesus
/ unto their own confusyon / shame / and vttrynge what they are within. But
true faith is (as says the apostle Paul) the gift of god / and is given to
sinners after the law has passed upon them / and has brought their
conseyences unto the brim of disperacion and sorrows of hell.

They that have this right faith consent to the law that it is right wise and
good / and iustifye god which made the law / and have delectacyon in the law
(natwithsta^ding that they can not fulfill it as they would for their wekenes)
and they abhor what so ever the law forbyddeth / though they can not always
avoid it. And their great sorrow is / because they can not fulfill the will of
god in the law / and the spirit that is in the^ / cries to god night and day
for strength and help with teres (as says Paul) yt can not be expressed with
tongue / of which things the be lefe of our popish or of their father / whom
they so magnify for his strong faith has none experience at all.

The first^ that is to say / he which iustifyeth himself with his outward
deeds / consents not to ye law inward / nether has delectatio^ their in: ye
/ he would rather that no such law were. So justifies he not god but hates
hi^ as a tyra^t / neither cares he for the promyses / but will with his own
strength be savior of himself / no wise glorifyeth he god though he seem
outward to do.

The second / that is to say / the sensual person / as a voluptuous swyne /
neither fereth god in his law / neither is thankful to him for his promises
and mercy / which is set forth in Christ to all them that believe.

The right christian man co^senteth to the law that it is rightwyse / and
iustifyeth god in the law: for he affermeth that god is rightwyse and just /
which is author of the law / he believes the promyses of god / and iustifyeth
god^ iugynge him true and believing that he will fulfill his promyses. With the
law he condempneth him self and all his deeds / and gives all the praise to
god. He believes the promyses / and ascrybeth all trauth to god. Thus every
where justifies he god and prayseth god.

By nature through the fall of Adam are we the children of wrath / heirs of
the vengeance of god by birth / ye / and from our co^ception. And we have our
fellowship with the dampened deuels under the power of derknes and rule of Satan /
while we are yet in our moders wo^bes / and though we show not forth the fruits
of syn as soon as we be borne / yet are we full of the natural poison whereof
all sinful deeds spring / and can not but syn outwardes (be we never so young
/ as soon as we be able to work if occasyon be given / for our nature is to do
syn / as is the nature of a serpent to stynge. And as a serpent yet young / or
yet vnbrought forth is full of poison / and can not afterward (when the time
is come and occasyon given) but bring forth the fruits thereof. And as an
edder / a tode / or a snake / is hated of man (not for the evil that it has
done but for the poison that is in it / and hurt which it can not but do) so
are we hated of god for that natural poison which is conceived and borne with
us / before we do any outward evil. And as the evil which a venomouse worm
does / makes it not a serpente: but because it is a venomouse worm / does
it evil and poysoneth: and as the fruit makes not the tree evil / but
because it is an evil tree / therefore brings it forth evil fruit / when the
season of fruit is. Even so do not our evil deeds make us first evil through
ignorance and blyndnes through evil workynge / harde^eth us in evil and makes
us worse and worse: but because that of nature we are evil therefore we both
think and do evil / and ar under vengeance / under the law conuycte to
eternal dampnation by the law / and ar contrary to the will of god in all our
will / and in all things consent to the will of the fend.

By grace / that is to say / by favor / we are plucked out of Ada^ / the
ground of all evil / and graffed in Christ the rote of all goodness. In
Christ god loved us his elect and chosen / before the world began / and
reserved us unto the knowledge of his son and of his holy gospel / and when
the gospel is preached to us / opens our hertes / and gives us grace to
believe / and puts the spirit of Christ in us / and we know him as our
father most merciful / and consent to the law / and love it inwardly in our
heart / and desire to fulfill it / and sorrow because we ca^nat / which will
(syn we of frayltie never so much) is suffycient till more strength be given
us / the blood of Christ has made satisfaction for the rest / the blood of
Christ has opteyned all things for us of god. Christ is our satisfactyon /
redemer delivered / savior from vengeance and wrath* Observe and mark in
Paul's / Peter's / and Jhons pistels / and in ye gospel what christ is unto us,

By faith ar we saved only i^ beleuynge the promises. and though faith be never
without love and good works / yet is our sauinge imputed nether to love nor
unto good works but unto faith only. For love and works ar under the law
which requires perfection / and the ground and fountain of the heart / and
damneth all imperfytues* Now is faith under the promyses which damn not: but
give perdon / grace / mercy / favor / and whatsoever is contained in the
promises.

Rightwisnes is diverse / for blide reason imagyneth many manners of
rightwisnesses. There is the rightwisnes of works (as I said before) when the
heart is away and is not felt how the law is spu^all and can not be fulfilled
but from the botom of the heart. As the just ministracyon* of al manner of laws
/ and the observing of them / for a worldly purpose and for our own profit
and not of love unto our neyboure without / all other respect and moral
virtues / wherein philosophers put their felicite and blessedness / which all ar
nothing in ye sight of god in respect of the life to come. There is in like
manner the iustifye^g of ceremonies which so^e imagyn their own selves / some
cou^terfey^e other / saying in their blide reason: such holy persons did thus
and thus / and they were holy men / therefore if I do so likewise / I shall
please god: but they have none answer of god / that y^ pleases. The jews
seek rightwisnes in their ceremonies which god gave unto the^ not for to
iustifye / but to discribe and paynt christ unto the^ / of which iues
testifyeth Paul / saying / how that they have affectyon to god: but not after
knowledge / for they go about to stablyssh their own justice / and ar not
obedyent to the justice or rightwysnes that comes of god / which is the
forgyuenes of syn in christ's blood / unto all that repent and believe. The
cause is verily / that except a man cast away his own imagynacyons and reason
/ he can not perceive god / and understand the virtue and power of the blood
of Christ. There is a full rightwisnes / wha^ the law is fulfilled from the
ground of the heart. This had not Peter nor paul in this life parfytly: unto
the utter most / that they could not be parfyter but syghed after it. They
were so farforth blessed in christ / that they hungered and thyrsted after it.
Paul had this thirst / he conse^ted to ye law of god / that it ought so to be
/ but he found another lust in his members contrary to the lust and desire of
his mind that let him / and therefore cried out saying: Oh wretched man that
I am: who shall deliver me from this body of death / thanks be to god through
Jesus Christ. The ryghtwysnes that before god is of value is to believe the
promyses of god / after the law has confounded the conscience. As when the
te^porall law often times condempneth the thief or morderer / and brings him
to execusyon / so that he sees no thing before him but present death / and
than comes good tidings / a charter from the king and delivers him.
Likewise when gods law has brought the sinner in a knowledge of him self /
and has confounded his conscience / and opened unto him the wrath and
vengeance of god / than comes good tidings / the Euangelyon shows unto him
the promyses of god in Christ / and how that Christ has purchased pardon for
hi^ has satisfied the law for him / and pesed the wrath of god. And ye pore
sinner believes / laudeth and thanketh god / through Christ / and breaks out
into exceeding inward joy / and gladness / for that he has escaped so great
wrath / so heavy vengeance / so ferfull and so everlasting a death And he hence
forth is an hungered and a thirst after more rightwisnes that he might fulfill
the law / and mourns contynually co^mendyng his wekenes unto god in the
blood of our sauyoure Christ Jesu.

Here shall ye se compe^diously and plainly set out / the order and practyse of
every thing before rehearsed.

The fall of Adam has made us heirs of the vengeance and wrath of god and
heirs af eternal da^pnation And has brought us i^to captiuyte and bondage
under the devil. And the devil is our lord and our ruler / our heed / our
governor / our prince / ye and our god: and our will is locked and knyt faster
unto the will of the devil / tha^ could an hundredth thousand chains bind a
man unto a post. Unto the deuyls will consent we with all our hertes / with all
our minds / with all our might / power strength / will and lust: so that the
law and will of the devil is written as well in our hertes as in our members /
and we run hedlonge after the devil with full seal / and the hole swing of
all the power we have / as a ston cast up into the air comes down naturally
of his own self / with all the vyolence and swing of his own weight. With
what poison dedly / and venomouse hate / hates a man his enemies? With how
great malice of mind inwardlye do we sleye and murder* With what vyolence
and rage / ye / and with how fervent lust commyt we aduoutrye / fornication /
and such like uncleanness with what pleasure and dylectacyon inwardly serves a
glotto^ his belly? With what dilygence disceyue we? How busely seek we the
things of this world? Whatsoever we do think / or ymagin / is abhomynable in
the sight of god. For we can refer nothing unto the honor of god: neither
is his law or will written in our members or in our hertes / neither is there
any more power in us to follow the will of god / tha^ in a stone to ascend
upward of his own self. And beside that we are as it were a sleep in so deep
blidnes that we can nether se nor feel i what misery / thraldom and wretchedness
we are in / till Moses come and wake us / and publysshe the law. When we here
the law truly preached / how that we ought to love and honor god with all our
strength and might from the low bothom of the heart / because he has created
us / and both heaven and earth for our sakes / and made us lord thereof: and
our neighbors (ye our enemies) as our selves inwardly from the ground of the
heart because god has made them after the lykenes of his own image / and they are his sons as well as we / and Christ has bought them with his blood / and
made them heirs of everlasting life as well as we: and how we ought to do
what so ever God bids / and absteyne from whatso ever god forbyddeth with
all love and mekenes / with a fervent and a burning lust from the center of
the heart: than begins the conscience to rage against the law and against
god, No see / be it never so great a tempest is so unquiet / for it is not
possible for a natural man to consent to ye law that it should be good / or
that god should be rightwise / which makes the law in asmoch as it is
contrary unto his nature and dampneth him / and all that he can do / and
neither shows hi where to fetch help / nor precheth any mercy / but only
sets man at varyance with god / as witnesses Paul. To. iiii. and provoke
him and styrreth him to rail on god / and to blaspheme him as a cruel tyrant.
For it is not possible for a man till he be borne again / to think that god
is rightwyse to make hi of so poison a nature / either for his own pleasure or
for the sin of another man / and to give him a law that is impossyble for him
to do / or to consent to his wit / reason and will / being so fast glued /
ye / nailed and cheyned unto the will of the devil Neither can any creatures
lose the bo^des / save the blood of christ only. This is captiuyte and bondage
whence christ delivered us / redeemed and losed us. His blood / his death / his
patience in suffrynge rebukes and wrongs / his prayers and fastings / his
mekenes and fulfyllyng of the utmost point of the law / peased the wrath of
god / brought ye favor of god to us again / opteined that god should love us
first / and be our father and that a merciful father / that will consydre our
infirmites and wekenes and will give us his spirit again (which was taken
away in the fall of Adam) to rule / govern / and strength us / and to break
the bonds of Satan / wherein we were so streit bound. When Christ is thus wise
preched / and the promyses rehearsed which are contained in the prophettes in the
Psalm. and in diverse places of the five books of Moses / which preaching is
called the gospel or glad t^dynges: than the hertes of them which are elect
and chose / begin to wax soft and to melte at the bountuous mercy of god /
and kyndnes showed of Christ. For wha^ the Euangelion is preched / the spirit
of god enters into the^ / which god has ordained and appointed unto eternal
life / and opens their inward eyes / and works such bele^e in them, when
the woeful conscyences feel and cast how sweet a thige the bitter death of
Christ is / and how merciful and loving god is through Christ's purchasing
and merytes / they begin to love again / and to consent to the law of god /
how that it is good and ought so to be / and that god is ryghtwyse which
made it / and desire to fulfill the law / even as a sick man desires to be
hole / and ar an hongred and thirst after more ritwysnes / and aft more
strength to fulfill the law more parfytly.

And i^ all that they do or omyt and leave undone, they seek gods honor / and
his will with mekenes / ever co^demni^g ye vnperfytnes of their deeds by ye law.
Now Christ stands us in double steed / and us serves two manner wise.
First he is our redemer / delyuerer / reconsyler / medyator / intercessor /
advocate or turney / solyciter / our hope / conforte / shield / protection /
defender / strength / health / satisfaction / and salvation. His blood / his
death / all yt he ever did / is ours. And Christ himself with all that he is or
can do / is ours. His blood shedynge and all that he did does me as good
service as though I my self had done it. And god (as great as he is) is mine
with all that he has as an husband is his wives through Christ and his
purchasing* Seco^darily / after that we be overcome with love and kyndnes /
and now seek to do the will of god (which is a christenma^s nature) Than have
we christ an example to cou^ter feyt / as says Christ hi self in Joh. I have
given you an example. And in another Evangelist / he says: He that will be great
among you shall be your servant and minister / as the son of man ^ame to
minister and ^at to be ministered unto, and Paul says: cou^terfet Christ. And
peter says / christ dyed for you / and left you an ensample to follow his
steps. What so ever therefore faith has received of god through christ's blood
and deseruyng / that same must love shede out every whyt / and bestow it on
our neybours unto their profyt / ye / and that though they be our enemies. By
faith we receive of god / and by love we shede out again. And that must we do
freely after the ensample of Christ with out any other respect / save our
neybours wealth only / and neither look for reward in earth nor yet in heaven for
the deserui^ge and merytes of our deeds as freres prech / though we know that
good deeds are rewarded* both in this life and in the life to come: but of
pure love must we bestow our selves al yt we have / and all that we are able to
do / even on our enemies to bring the^ to god / co^syderige nothing but their
wealth as christ did ours* christ ^yd not his deeds to obtain heaven ^herby
(that had be^ a madness) heaven ^as his already / he was heir ther^f / it was his
by inherytaunce / but ^yd the^ freely for our sakes / consyde^^nge nothing but
our welthe / and to ^ringe the favor of god to us a^ayne / and us to god. As
no natural ^^e that is his fathers heir / does ^s fathers will because he
would be heir / that he is already by birth: his father gave hi^ that are he
was borne / and is lother that he should go without it / than he him self has
wit to be: but of pure love does he that he does. And ask him why he does
any thing that he does: he answers: My father bad / it is my fathers will /
it pleases my father* Bond servants work for hyre. Children for love. For
their father with all he has is theirs already.

So does a christian man freely all that he does / consydereth nothing but the
will of god and his neighbors wealth only: if I live chaste / I do it not to
opteyne heaven thereby: For than should I do wrong to the blod of christ.
Christ's blood has opteyned me that / Christ's merits has made me heir
thereof. He is both door and way thitherwardes, Neither that I look for an hier
room in heaven than they shall have which live in wedlock / either than a hoar
in ye stews (if she repent) for that were the pride of Lucyfere. But freely to
wait on the euangelion: and to avoid the trouble of the world / and occasyons
that might pluck me there from / and to serve my brother withal / even as one
hand helps another / or one member another / because one feleth another
grefe / and the pain of the one is the pain of the other. Whatsoever is done
to ye lest of us (wheder it be good or bad it is done to Christ / and what so
ever is done to my brother (if I be a christen man) the same is done to me.

Neither does my broders pain grieve me less tha^ mine own / neither rejoice.
I les at his wealth tha^ at mine own / if I love him as well and as much as my
self / as the law commands me if it were not so: how says Paul? Let him
that reioyseth rejoice in the lord / that is to say Christ / which is lord
over all creatures / if my merits obtained me heaven or a hier place there than
had I* wheri I mit rejoice besides ye lord Here se ye the nature of the law
and the nature of the Euangelion. How the law is the key that byndeth and
dampneth all men / and the Euangelion is the key that loses the^ again. The
law goth before and the eua^gelion follows. Where a precher precheth the law
/ he byndeth all consciences / and when he precheth the gospel / he loses
them again. These two salues (I mean the law and the gospel) uses god and
his precher to heal and cure sinners with all. The law drives out the
disease / and makes it appear / and is a sharp salve / and a fretynge corsey
/ and kylleth the deed flesh / and loses and draws the sores out by the
rotes / and all corruption. It pulls from a man the trust and confydence that
he has in him self and in his own works / merytes / deservings / and
cerimonyes / and ro^beth him of all his rightwisnes and makes him pore. It
kylleth him / sends him down to hell / and brings him to utter disperacion
/ and prepayreth the way of the lord / as it is written of Joh. the Baptiste.
For it is not possible that Christ should come to a man as long as he trusts
in him self / or in any worldly thing / or has any rightwysnesse of his own
/ or riches of holy works. Than comes the Euangelyon / a more gentle plaster
/ which soupleth and swageth the wounds of the conscience / and brings
health. It brings the spirit of god / which loses the bonds of Satan / and
coupleth us to god and his will through strong faith and ^eruent love / with
bonds to strong for the devil / the world or any creature to lose the^, And
the poor and wretched sinner feleth so great mercy / love / and kyndnes in god
that he is sure in him self how that it is not possible that god should for
sake hi^ / or withdraw his mercy and love from him. And boldly cries out with
Paul / saying: Who shall separate us from the love that god loves us with all?
That is to say / what shall make me believe that God loves me not? shall
tribulation? anguysshe? persecution? shall hungre nakedness? shall sword? Nay
/ I am sure that neither death nor life / neither angel / neither rule nor
power / neither present things nor things to come / neither hye nor low /
neither any creature is able to separate us from the love of god which is in
Christ Jesus our lord. In all such tribulacyons a Christen man perceyueth that
god is his father / and loves him / even as he loved Christ when he shed his
blood on the cross. Finally / as before when I was bound to the Devil and
his will / I wrought all manner evil and wickedness / not for helles sake which
is the reward of sin / but because I was heir of hell by birth and bondage
to the devil / did I evil. For I could non otherwise do / to do syn was my
nature. Even so now / sith I am coupled to god by christ's blood / do I well /
not for heuens sake / which is yet ye reward of well doing: but because I am
heir of heaven by grace and christ's purchasing / and have the spirit of god /
I do good freely / for so is my nature As a good tree bri^geth forth good fruit
/ and an evil tree evil fute. By the fruits shall ye know what the treis. A
man's deeds declare what he is within / but make hi^ neither good nor bad /
though after we be created a new by the spirit and doctrine of Christ / we
wa^e parfyter always with workynge according to the doctrine / and not with
blind works of our own imagini^g. We must be first evil ere we do evil / as
a serpent is first poisoned ere he poison. We must be also good ere we do good*
as the fire must be first ho^e / ere it hete another thing. Take an ensample /
as those blind and deffe which are cured in the gospel could not se nor here /
till Christ had given the^ sight and herynge / and those sick could not do the
deeds of an hole man / till Christ had given them health: So can no man do good
in his soul / till Christ have losed him out of the bonds of Satan / and have
given him wherewith to do good / ye / and first have powered in to him that
self good thing which he showed forth afterward on other. What so ever is
our own is sin. What so ever is above that / is Christ's gi^t purches /
doing / and workynge. He bought it of his fader derely with his blood / ye /
with his most bitter death and gave his life for it.

What so ever good thing is in us / that is given us freely without our
deseruynge or merytes for Christ's blodes sake. That we desire to follow the
will of god / it is the gift of Christ's blood. That we now hate the deuylles
will (whereunto we were so fast locked / and could not but love it) is also
the gift of Christ's blood / unto whom belongs the praise and honor of our
good deeds / and not unto us.

Our deeds do us three manner ser uyce. First they certify us that wear heirs of
everlasting life. And that the spirit of god / which is the ernest thereof is
in us / in that our hertes consent unto the law of god and we have power in
our me^bres to do it / though imparfytly. And secondarily we tame the flesh
there with / and kill the sin that remains yet in us / and wax daily
parfyter and parfyter in the spirit therewith and keep that the lusts choke not
the word of God that is sown in us / nor quence the gifts or worki^g of the
spirit / and that we lose not the spirit again. And thirdly we do our duty
unto our neybour there with and help their necessite unto our own comfort also
/ and draw al me^ unto the honori^ge and praisynge of god. And who so ever
exelleth in the gifts of grace / let the same think that they be given him /
as much to do his broders service as for his own self / and as much for the
love which god has to the weke as unto him / unto who^ god gives such
gifts. And he that withdraws ought that he has from his neighbors need /
robs his neybours and is a thief. And he that is proud of the gifts of god
and thinks him self / by the reason of the^ better than his feeble neyboure /
and not rather as the truth is / knowlegeth him self a seruau^te unto his
poor neybour / by y^ reason of them the same has lucyfers spirit in him and
not christ's. These things to know: first the law / how that it is natural
right and equite / that we have but one god to put our hope and trust in / and
hun to love with all the heart / all the soul / and all our might and power and
neither to move heart nor hand but at his commandment / because he has
first created us of naught and heaven and earth for our sakes. And afterward
when we had marred our self through sin / he forgave us and created us
again in the blood of his beloved son.

And that we have ye name of our one god in fear and reverence / and that we
dishonor it not in swearynge thereby about light trysles or vanite or call it
to record for the co^fyrmi^g of wickedness or falshed / or ought / that is to
the dyshonoure of God / which is the brekynge of his laws or unto the hurt of
our neighbor.

And inasmoch as he is our lord and god / and we his double possessyon by
creacion and redemption / and therefore ought / as I said / neither to move heart
or hand without his commandment / it is right that we have needful
holyedayes to come together and learn his will / both the law which he will
have us ruled by / and also the promyses of mercy which he will have us trust
unto / and to give god thanks together of his mercy / and committee our
infyrmities to him through our savior Jesus / and to reconsyle our selves unto
him / and each to other / if ought be between brother and brother that
requires it. And for this purpose and such like / as to vyset the sick and
nedy / and redress peace and vnyt^e / were the holidays ordained only / and
so farforth ar they to be kept holy from al manner works that may be
co^uenyently spared for the time till this be done and no further / but than
laufully to work.

And that it is right that we obey father and mother / master / lord / prince
/ and king / and all the ordynaunces of the world bodily and gostly by which
god rules us and ministers freely his benefytes unto us al. And that we love
them for the benefytes that we receive by the^ / and fere them for the power
they have over us / to punyssh us if we trespace the law and good order. So
far yet ar the worldly powers or rulers to be obeyed only / as their
commandments repugne not against the commandment of god / and than ho.
Wherefore we must have gods commandment ever in our hertes / and by the hyer
law interpret the inferyor: that we obey nothi^ge against the belefe of our
god / or against the faith / hope and trust that is in him only / or against the
love of god where by we do or leave undone all thing for his sake / and that we
do nothing for any man's commandment against the reverence of the name of god
/ to make it dispysed and the less fered and set by / and that we obey
nothing to the hynderaunce of the know lege of the blessed doctrine of god /
whose servant the holy day is.

Not withstanding though the rulers which god has set over us command us
against god / or do us open wrong / and oppress us with cruel tyranny / yet
because they are in gods rowme / we may not avenge our selves / but by the
process and order of goods law / and laws of man made by ye auctorite of gods
law / which is also gods law / ever by an hier power and remytti^ge y^
vengeance unto god / and in the mean season suffer until y^ hour be come.

And on ye other side to know that a man ought to love his neibour equally and
fully / as well as him self / because his neibour (be he never so siple) is
equally created of god and as full redeemed by the blood of our savior Jesu
Christ. Out of which commandment of love spring these. Kill not thy neibour
/ defyle not his wife / bear no false witness against him / and finally / not
only do not these things in deed / but coueyt not in thine heart / his house /
his wife / his manseruant / maydseruant / ox / ass or whatsoever is his. So
that these laws perteynyng unto our neyboure are not fulfilled in the sight of
god save with love. He that loves not his neyboure / keeps not this
commandment: defyle not thy neighbors wife / though he never touch her or
never se her / or think upon her. For the commandment is / though thy
neybours wife be never so fair / and thou have never so great oportunytie
given the / and she content or happily provoke the / as Putiphers wife did Joseph
/ yet se thou love thy neibour so well / that for very love thou can not find
in thine heart to do that wickedness. And even so he that trusts in any
thing save in god only and in his son Jesus Christ / keeps no
comm^u^deme^t at al in the sight of god.

For he that has trust i^ any creature / wherther in heaven or in earth / faue
in god and his son Jesus / ca^se no cause to love god with all his heart.
etc. Neither to abstain from dishonourynge his name / nor to keep the holy
day for the love of his doctrine / nor to obey louyngly the rulers of the
world / nor any cause to love his neighbor as him self / and to abstain
from hurtynge him / where he may get profit by him / and save him self
harmles. And in like wise against this law / love thy neibour as thy self. I
may obey no worldly power to do ought at any man's commandment unto the hurt
of my neybour that has not ^eserued it / though he be a turk.

And to know how contrary this law is unto our nature / and how it is
dampnation / ^at to have this law written in our hertes / though we never
committee the deeds: and how there is none other means to be saved from the
dampnacion / tha^ through repentance toward the law and faith in Christ's blood
/ which are ye very inward baptim of our souls / and the washing and the
dippynge of our bodies in the water / is the outward sign. The plungyng of
the body under the water signifies that we repent and profess to fight
against sin and lusts / and to kill the^ every day more and more / with the
help of god and our dilygence in following the doctrine of Christ and the
ledynge of his spirit / and that we believe to be washed from our natural
dampnation in which we are borne / and from all the wrath of the law / and
from all the infyrmytes and weknesse that remain in us / after we have given
our consent unto ye law / and yielded ourselfe to be scolers thereof / and from
all the imperfytnesse of all our deeds done with cold love / and from all
actual sin which shall chance on us while we enforce the contrary and ever
fight there against and hope to sine no more. And thus / repe^tau^ce and faith
begin at our baptyme and first professynge the laws of god / and continue
unto our lives end / and grow as we grow in the spirit. For the perfyter we
be the gretter is our repentance / and the stronger our faith. And thus as the
spirit and doctrine on gods perte and repentance and faith on our part
beget us a new in Christ: eue^ so they make us grow and wax parfeyt and save
us unto the end and never leave us until all syn be put of and we clean
purifyed and full fourmed and facyoned after the symilytude and lykenes of the
perfytnes of our savior Jesus / whose gift all is.

And finally to know that what so ever good th^ge is in us / that same is the
gift of grace / and therefore not of deseruyng / though many things be given
of god / through our dilyge^ce in working his laws and chastesige our bodies
and in prayenge for the^ and beleu^ge his promyses / which else should not be
given us / yet our workinge deserves not the gifts / no more tha^ the
dilygence of a marchaunte in seeking a good ship / brings the goods safe
to land / though such dilygence does now and than help therein. But when we
believe in god / and than do all that is in our might and not tempt him / than
is god tr^we to abide by his promise and to help us and perform alone when
our strength is past These things I say to know / is to have all the scripture
unlocked and opened before the / so that if thou wylt go in and read / thou
cannest not but understand. And in these things to be ignorant / is to have
all the scripture locked up / so that the more thou redest it the blinder thou
art / and the more contrary thou fyndest in it / and the more tangled art thou
therein and can nowher through For if thou add a gloss in one place / in
another it will not serve. And therefore / because we be never taught the
professyon of our baptim / we remain always unlearned / as well the spiritualte
for all their great clergy and hye scoles / as we say / as the lay people. And
now because the lay and unlearned people ar taught these first princyples of
our profession therefore they read the scripture and understand and delight
therein: And our great pyller of holy church / which have nailed a veil of
false gloses on Moses face / to corrupt the true understanding of his law /
can not come in. And therefore bark and say / the scripture makes heritykes
and it is not possykle for them to understand it in English / because they
them selves do not in latyne. And of pure malice that they can not have their
will / they sley their brethrene for their faith they have in our savior and
therewith utter their blody woluysshe tyranny / and what they be within and
whose dyscyples. Here with reder / be committed unto the grace of our savior
Jesus / unto whom and god our father through him be praise from ever and for
ever.

Amen.
A letter sent unto a certain friend / to enstructe hi^ in the understanding
of the scripture / transla^ted out of French into English.
MY well-beloved brother in Christ / the savior / the peace and mercy of god be
with you / and with all them that will the honor of god and the^crease of his
gospel. Amen. I give thanks unto our savior / that it has pleased hi^ (in
this great wretchedness of infydelyte / with the which the pore souls bought
with the precious blood of Christ / were sore clogged and combred) to give us
knowledge of his word / the which was holy buried and drowned by the reason
of leude lerning fables / and dreams of men which have be^ hitherto preched in
the place of the right holy and worthy word of god / which the very sauyoure
and redemer of ye world / the only mediator between god and man / very god
and very man Jesus Christ came to show us which words (I mean the words of
holy scripture / a man ought to receive in as great reverence as though our
sauyoure spoke unto us in his own person / greatly therefore ought we to thank
him / that it has plesed him of his unspeakable goodness / to give us this
grace / that we may read his holy gospels / and blessed be they that shall bear
these holy words and keep them.

In as much therefore / well-beloved brother / that god of his infinite mercy (and
not by our deseruyng / which can do nothing but sin) has given us this
grace to read these godly words / and to be refresshed with this heavenly
breed. I desire you that in all humilyte and loulynes of heart / knowlegi^ge
that you be nothing but sin and abhomi^ation (as all worldly things be)
without any manner of presumyng upon your own wit / knowledge or wisdom: ye
come unto the redynge of the holy word of god / setting all your heart in our
lord / desyring hi^ with lowly prayer / faithfully that it would please him to
give you his holy spirit / as he has promised to the^ that faithfully require
it of him and so with a sure confydence and fast hope and trust of his infinite
goodness / desire him that he will open unto you the kingdom of heuyn / with
the key which no man can give but he / and that it will please him to lyghten
your heart through pure and true understanding of the christen faith / to
the end you may be made a true creature living no ^^ger in yourself / but all
together in Jesu christ / and that we love nothing but him and nothing to love
another in heaven nor in earth but for the love of him: and even as he commanded
you to love your neibour socouryng hi^ in his bodylye needs / so that you
socour him / and not norisshe him in his dampnable life / as they do which
give the gods that belong to their children / and which the pore me^ should
have / that through wekenes can not get their living / unto a sort of
vyllayn swyneheedes and strong lubbers / which have strength enough to labor
for their living / the which ye ought not to feed: for he that will not
labor (says the Appostle) should not eat. Furthermore ye ought to love your
neighbor and his health so ardentlye that ye should not stycke to dye for him
/ if case required / the which thing betokens and sygnifyeth the co^munyo^
of the precyouse body and blood of our lord / that we be one body in Jesu
Christ / and likewise as he dyed for us / so we do dye one for another: for we
must love one another likewise as he loved us / for so he commands us /
saying: I give you a new commandment yt one of you love another / likewise as
I have loved you.

In this charity and love is ye so^me and conclusion of all scripture. For that
makes us love (for the honor of god) fader and mother / husband / wife /
children / brethren / systers / and all other thing except god: ye / our selue
and makes us leave and forsake / for else we can not be the discyples of Jesu
Christ / and without being his disciples we can have no porcyon nor part with
him / for he that lo^eth any thing except he love it only for the love of god
^he has not yet forsaken al things: but he that loves nothing but for ye
love of god and nether does / nether wills anythi^ge / but for the love and
honor of god / he has tru^y forsaken all things. Take heed you do not
misundersta^de me / for when I say that you should forsake all thing / I do
not mean that you should enter relygion and make yourself a monk / a friar /
or a no^ne: for there is no ^eple in the world that has les forsaken all
thing tha^ they. Whom shall ye se more busyer / more curious about other men's
busynes tha^ they? who^ shall ye se more covetous / having less pitye and
mercy on the pore? less feringe and regarding god and his holy word / less
ferynge to break his commandment which stands all in love toward a man's
neyboure / which they consydre not / but give ^^lygence that their belly be
full / keeping the^ to the rulers that man has made setting light by the
commandment of god: ye / and brekynge them daily ^n that they ouercharge and
devour the houses of poor wydowes and other simple people under ye color of
long prayer and feigned holiness.

To the end that such as seek no^ other but to devour you / dysceyue you not
/ it is necessary that you hold you unto the word of god. And that you may
the lyghtlyer understand the scripture / ye shall understand that in holy
scripture we have the law / which is so called for the most part / and
sometime it is called the law of bondage of ye flesh and of sin / we have
of works and of righteousness of man / and also of works of the flesh of the
law. On ^he othersyde we have also the gos^ell / the law of lyberte of the
spirit and of grace: of faith / and of the rightousnesse that comes of god of
the gospel / faith and spirit.

The law is called generally in all scripture every commandment by the which
we are commanded to do or to shon and not do any thing / as thou shalt love
god above all thing thou shalt not sley / thou shalt not desire any thing /
that is to say / thou shalt not coueyt or desire any thing contrary unto the
motion of the spirit of god: for all concupiscence of lust contrary to the
will of god is sin / and when the law is set before us and given us / by and
by our flesh / that is to say / we our self which be nothing but flesh
with out the spirit of god / begin for to wax angry and to be inflamed and
set a fire / and to be moved and styrred with great iudignacio^ by ye reason of
our sin and filthiness which the law shows and opens unto us / for before
the workyng of the law / man was in peace brought a sleep in syn / not per
ceyuynge the concupiscence and lusts not beleuyng that they were sins but
when he has received the law he feleth his sin / out of the which he can
not draw himself / for the more he goth about by his own works / virtues and
strength to rise out of sin / the more he augmenteth and increases his
sin. For (as saint Paul says) god sent unto us his son / because it was
impossyble for us to keep the law by the reason of the infirmite that was in
us / to the end that the rightousnes which comes of faith / might be parfyt
in us / for if it had been possible for us to have been justified by the law and
to have fulfilled it / what need christ to have dyed? And because it is
impossyble to accomplysshe and fulfill the law without the spirit of god /
the flesh grudgeth full of anger and malice / saying: How is it possible
that I love god above all thing / or by that means I should have my heart
always up to god / which heart of his own nature can not think nor ymagyne
any thing but vanytie / requyrynge always and in all things his own glory
and profit / and not the honor of god nor the profit of mine even christen.
Helas / I seek not that thige that should be to Christ's pleasure / but all
together mine own commodytie. How is it possible but I should have
concupisce^ce and lustyng contrary to the will of god / co^sydri^g that I am
nothing but flessh / which has ever desires against the spiryt by the reason
whereof I can not do that thing yt I would? Helas wherefore has god given this
law which is so burdenous and so weighty? And on this facyon the flesh sore
grieved with the weight of ye law / which is more than he can bear /
perceiving how sore it does condemn him and all his deeds / begins for to
curse and hate the law / and so consequently god which made the law. and for
this cause saint Paul says / The law works anger / in as much as the flesh
knowing his offenses and having his offenses laid before him by the law /
and seeing that he can not rise out of them / does wrestel and strive with
himfelfe / and murmuring against the law / as before is said / questyoneth
and reasons in him self: why god gave the ^awe to Adam of the fruit of life
/ and why he made hi^ not of such nature that he should not sin / and such
other things which by great ignomynies and blasphemies against god and his hye
wisdom: which man being but ashes and dust / pres^meth to judge and reprehende
the divine prudence. And it is as much as to will that god were not god. For if
he were not rightouse in every thing / he were not god / and his justice and
righteousness require / that such inhibicions and laws should be ministered to ye
orgulous and proud flesh / for to bring hi^ down out of his pride. Wherefore
to will that these holy laws were not given to men / is to will that god were
not: and such be the blasphemies of the flessh when she receives the law /
which is spu^all / in the which she has no inte^deme^t nor understanding: for
she weneth to compass it by works / which thing only faith does. And now
wha^ he sees and perceives / that though he do never so much he ca^ not
accomplissh or fulfill the law / than is he full of horror and of dispeyre /
seeing that hell is ready for him / because of the transgression of the law /
and when he can imagyn ^o ways to avoid the indignation of the law / than all
disolate and full of despair he beg^neth to abhor the law / and without the
father of heaven draw him and inspyre him / the way to fulfill the law / he
does all contrary to it. For of hi^ self he can not choose but sin and do
evil. And therefore is the law given us / because we should know our s^nes /
and the only of fyce of the law is not to justify us: but she we us our
wekenesse and feblenesse in well doing / and to show man that he has deserved
death and damnation / which by his own power he ca^ not shon / to the end that
a man knowing his own wekenes and unableness to do well / dispeyre of his own
virtue and strength / settinge aside all co^fydence in any th^ge that he ca^ do
humble him self / knowleging that if our merciful lord of his unspeakable
mercy / deliver him not from death and dampnacyon / the which he has deserved
through transgressyon of the law / he had perysshed and ben dampened for ever.
For if our fearse and proud heart be not mekened first by the law / and make
us confess our self Sinners / we should never be saved by Christ for he came
for to save sinners and unrighteous / not them that be rightuouse and just /
which justify them self by their works.

But when a man knows his own fylthynes and abomination / and sees that he
is condemned rightuously to everlasting death / tha^ comes the gospel / which
is to say glad tidings in use and is presented unto hi^ which says: Thou
wretched thief which would have deprived god of his godheed / and would
have been thine own god through thy pride: Thou wretched and desperate caityfe
which after the just judgment of god had deserved to be hanged on ye
galowes of hell / which have the halter about thy neck / that is to say / thy
will / thy flesh and thy lusts / which be lords over the by reason that the
spirit of god rules not in the. The most mercy full god has sent the thy
pardone / and will not that this judgment be executed / but that thou be quyte
and have thy life / and be delivered from the hands of the devil of hell /
which was thy ha^ge man / whom thou dydest serve and work to. And he has not
alonely rydde the from death and made the his servant / but also grants the
to be his son and inherytour with our sweet sauyoure Jesus / which is become
thy brother / and whom the father of his infynite goodness and kindness (not for
because of thy good deeds which have done never but evil) has given for the /
to make full satis factyon for all thy evil deeds / so that thou believe that
he dyed for thy sin and rose again to iustifye the / which desires none
other thig but to save that the which was lost / that is to say sinners /
which through their own deservings were in the way of da^pnacion. And wha^
the conscience which was before full of great dread / hereth this good tidings
(if god give the^ the grace to give crede^ce thereto and believe the^) than they
be certain / by the reason of this faith / that they be pardoned of all their
offenses / through the death and passion of Jesu Christ. Than co^ceyue they a
great joy / mirth and in ward reioysynge in the^ self. And our merciful
lord in gyuynge us this faith gives us also his spirit the which makes us
the very children of god through faith / and the very ^e^bres of the body of
Jesu christ / and we be in all things always conduyted and direct by this
holy spirit of god / for otherwise could we not be the children of god / for
they only be the children of god / which be led by the spirit of god. So we
having this holy spirit in us to be our gyde and directour of our journey /
which is all charity and love / by the which the law is accomplysshed / the
law is fulfilled in us. And by the reason of his holy spirit which gydeth us /
we go no more in the way of the flessh. For the flessh has no le^ger dominion
over us / but is cast out of his ki^gdome (Christ reining in us by the holy
ghost) which causes us daily to mortify our flesh which always is contrary
unto ye spirit / destroyeng / pullyng down and co^suminge our concupiscences
and lusts by ye fire of charity. And albeit that this concupiscens is syn ye /
and mortal sin of his own nature / nevertheless it is not imputed nor
rekened unto us which are members of Jesu Christ / considering that by the
reason of the spirit of god we love god with all our heart / and desire nothing
so much / as the will of god to be done in us. And so by the reason that we have
this good spirit in us / we never si^ne. For this new natiuyte / by the which
we be made the infantes of god / does co^serue and keep us / that is ye
holyghost / which through faith is given us. But in as much as all our wits /
will / and intendementes be but flessh / as long as we be ^uironed and clogged
with this corruptyble body / which is a great let unto the soul / we ca^ not
be without sin / seeing that all thing that is in us / except the gifts of
god / which sue and come of faith / is always contrary unto the spirit / by
the reason whereof evermore / as touching the old man and first Adam / the
outward man / the man of syn and flesh / we syn. And if we say that we have
no sin / we lie and deceive our selves / and because of this / have we cause
evermore to meke^ our self and to put away all confydence in us or in our
works / gyuynge all glory unto god / which of his only grace delivered us from
the captyuytie of death / making it of no effect or power to lose or distroy
us. For the life which he has given us by the spirit of his son / is far
gretter than is this death / and therefore it can not harm us. Which is a
great assurance to a man's conscience / for when he believes surely in Jesu
Christ / he is assured and certifyed that Jesu Christ is in him / and therefore
he can be afraid of nothing / seeing that Jesu Christ is puysaunt and mighty
/ which has vaynquysshed the world and all power contrary unto the soul /
in the which he dwells by his holy spyryte / so that nothing can ceperate
him from his sovereign wealth / which is Jesu Christ / which comforts him
with his holy promyses / which every faithful ought to have contynually before
him. And by this menes is the soul delivered from the great quakyng and
tremblyng that he was in before the gospel was presented unto him / which
dread the law brought him unto / showing him that he had deserved dampnacyon
in the brekynge thereof. But when he hereth those same glad tydi^ges / he has
an inward joy in himself which no heart of man can think without that he
have proved it.

For the more harder the condemnation is / and the more sharp the death is
that follows it / and from the more greuousnesse that he is delivered and
brought to this blessedness and life / which he never looked for / the more is
his joy great, And therefore ye soul consyderinge the excedyng goodness that ye
endless mercy that the father of heaven has done for him / in gyuyng his son for
him / ponderi^ge also the most inestimable swetnesse of the most benige Jesus /
who has spent and shed his blood for him taki^g upon him all his si^nes /
cancellyng and making void the oblygacion of death in the which he was bond /
washing him pure and clean in his blood / baptisynge him with ye holy spirit
/ the which of an ardent love would vouchesafe to come down and dwell in his
conscience for to direct it / and instruct it or corroborate it in faith /
gyuyng him understanding in the word of god / layeng al these great gifts
and sondrie benefytes together / conceyueth through the working of the holyghost
a marvelous ardent love toward god by the reason of the which he is set on
fire / and burns in the meruelouse zele that he has to the honor of god.
And when he sees that he can not please god so highlye as he would do / by the
reason of the flesh with his aduersarye unto the spirit: and that his work
be nothing parfyte by the reason of his infirmite: he mourns in him self /
desyring to be delivered from his seruytute of corrupcyon of si^ne: but than is
he brought in quyetnes by ye holy spirit which prays for him with unspeakable
sighs / that this empeshment or let may be taken away / to the end he may
fulfill the will and the law of god without any gaynsay or contradyc^yon. And
in all such rekenynges ^he holyghost comforts him / so that at the last he
takes all in gree pa^yently / taking all his pleasure in god / and that in
all temptacyons and trybulacions and afflyctions that shall come to him. For the
holyghost shows him the promyses which are contained in holy scripture and
so instruct / seeing that it is the will of god that he should be so vexed / he
reioyseth in all his te^ptacions / and all his troubles be light and sweet unto
him. Howbeit there is one temptation which is more great and more horrible than
all other / that is / when we be persecuted on al sides / and wha^ the lord
withdraws his consolation and confort from us / as though he were angrye
against us / for to prove and taste our faith and confydence that we have in
the goodness of god. for wha^ our lord does comfort us and we feel him to be
present / we set light of all our trybulacio^s. be it loss of goods / of
children / of wife / of husband / of life / or of all honor / or whatsoever
it be. But wha^ we per^eyue not him to be nygh us wha^ he absenteth himself to
our semynge / to the proof of our faith / than we lackyng him lack all goodness
/ full of sin and wretchedness / se our self abhorred by ye reason of our
fylthynes / se all thing against us / se hell open to devour and swalow us up
/ as the forsaken of god. In this marvelous te^ptacion it is but a folly to
ro^ne for socour to our good works / for the best of the^ do but condemn us.
For all the good deeds that come of our self be but fylthines and abhominacion
before god / and as a cloth defiled and contamynate with ye flowers of a woman.
In such a te^ptacion there is no remedy but faith that is to have full
co^fydence and trust in the promyses of god / as be these. He that believes i^
me shall not taste euerlasti^ge death. Nothing is impossyble to hi^ that
believes. Al they that call on the name of ye lord shall be saved. And
according to your faith / be it unto you. And many other / of which holy
scripture is full.

Such promyses as promise us life and delyueraunce from our euyls ^e called
euangelique / and be the very gospel or glad tidings which saves that
which the law damp^eth / which quyteth when the law condempneth unto the death
/ so that ^elefe be given thereto. And ye soul also has another thing which
may assure him / that is / that our health ^s not in our hands / for if it
were / we should have lost it within a while / but in the hand of god / out of
whose hand no power can take it. and also that we be ye sheep of christ which
can not be rauysshed out of his hand / for as him self says. No parson
shall take the^ away nor bereue me of the^. And this must we believe surely that
he came to save sinners / and in as much as we be sinners / he is com to save
us / and the more that the soul perceyueth hi^ self oppressed with great and
horrible sins so much the more to have confyde^ce in the death of our savior
/ which satisfied for all the syn of the world leuynge to have any trust in
his good works / but only to have confydence in the great goodness of god /
which he declared habundantlye in the passion and death of his son. For if by
works a man might accomplyssh and fulfill the law / christ suffered death in
vain. Wherefore on Jesus only must we set all our confydence. Now we must not
because Christ is come to save sinners and to help the^ that be diseased. We
must not therefore sin still / to the end that he should save us still: for
we have done to much alredye and sin every day and sin every hour sore /
for there is not so rightuouse a man but he synneth / at the lest seven times a
day: but those same sins of the rightuouse man be not imputed unto him /
because that the spirit of god is within him / for they be not in him / for as
touching the inward man / and in that that he has the spirit / he synneth
not. For the faith contynueth hole and parfeyte in the spiryt / which faith
has put away the hole body of sin / so that sin ^^ygneth not in us /
because we be made new creatures / though now and than by the reason of our
wekenesse we do sin: yet this sin is not imputed because of the strife that
we have against it. And for this cause must we humble our self before god /
and knowledge our self to be si^ners / and also have a sure belefe that our
sins be forgiven us / even as we be assured by the infallyble promyses of god
/ for as much as we believe / so much receive we of god / as he said: According
to your faith so be it to you. It is not possible yt we believe our sins to be
forgyue^ us in Christ / but they be so in deed.

Note well these words and print the^ fast in your heart that you forget the^
not / for it shall be very necessary for you to have recourse unto these holy
words and promyses / that you may defend you against all temptations. for I
am certain that if you be of Christ / loving him above all things that the
devil shall lay unto you great assaults for to make you tumble from the
faith of Jesu Christ. Wherefore pray instantly god our good lord that he will
co^serue you and augme^t your faith / and ^ndoutedly he will angment it as ^e
has promised^ and look that you re^yst all te^ptacyons strong in faith.

Well-beloved brother / the word of god can not lie / it has given us ^arnynge.
They have persecuted me and so will they do you. Wherefore ^^inke not the
contrary / but if ye fo^^we Christ / ye must be persecuted and mocked / and
laughed to scorn within the house and also without of ^^l the world / and
none shall speak ^ell of you. If so noble a prince and ^^ exellente was made a
mocking ^ocke / was reproved and persecuted ^^ all the worlde*as was Jesus our
^^ed / it can not be chose^ but the me^bres must be likewise hated / for it is
not comlye the heed to be full of thorns and the members full of pleasure and
delytes, Likewise as the heed was not of the world / no more should the me^bres
be. Wherefore the world dispyseth them as enemies and contrary to their pride /
their covetousness and their flesshly pleasure. But it is necessary that you
confort your self with the blessings that our lord gives to them which take
trouble for the honor of him.

And that you lay evermore before you / the sermon that our sauyoure Jesus
spoke in the mountain / where he says: Blessed be they that suffer
persecutyon for righteousness sake / that is to say / for the love of Jesu
Christ / for he is our right^ousnes and our wisdom. And also he says:
Happy be you when me^ shall curse you and say all evil against you lyenge for
my sake / for great shall be your reward. etc.

Because we should not dispeire and think our self out of the favor of god
because we be persecuted / he gives us warning that the elect and chosen
have he persecuted from the beginning of the world: for the enemies of ye
truth never cesse nor shall cesse unto the end of the world to persecute the
faythefull^ which by their faith and long pac^ence / at the ^ast shall
overcome. And wha^ their enemies we^e to have trodden them under the foot / tha^
shall they be most victorious, Believe surely that our ^orde does much for us
when he gives us the grace to endure and suffer any thing for his honor /
for a noble heart which loves his king well / is marvelous well apayde wha^ the
king makes him knight / gyuynge him charge for to do battle for the quarrel
and honor of ye king. Likewise the faithful ought greatly to thank god / in
that that he suffers for his honor. For all our fely cite lies in this /
that we be made conform and like unto our captain and head Jesu christ / and
if we be troubled and vexed in this world with him / we shall also raygne with
hi,

It can not be but there must be always debate between the world and the
faithful / for they be of contrary affections.

The world is nothing but pride / covetousness / all fylthynesse and
flesshely lusts.

The faithful and the children of god be all together humilyte / and lyberaly
tie and all clennesse and lovers of spiritual things / full of faith / hope /
and charity / estemynge themself of no goodness / knowlegyng themself to be
but sine / setting naught by worldly goods / loving nothing but gods
honor.

The world desires nothing ^ut to pluck to him and gather all ^^at it can
catch / and snatche by a^y manner of ways.

The faithful on the contrary ^arte be as dily gente to dele and to ^yue to
al them that have need and that they may socoure / for the ho^oure of God /
and desire none other richesse but god.

The world desires nothing so ^^etly as to be praised / honored and
^agnifyed / taking more upon him ^^a^ becomes him / and will have none ^^aysed
or spoken of but himself.

The faithful care not though ^hey ^e despised / dispraysed or mo^^ed for the
honor of god / giuyng ^^l praise and honor unto him / de ^pringe nothing so
much as the honor of god only / of whom ryseth and springs all goodness.

They that be of the world love nothing but them selves / and that thing that
pleases them and them that love them / hatynge all thing contrary to their
mind / all thing that greueth or displeases them / and chefely of al / they
ca^ not away with the cross (though no man cross himself oftener than they)
they love nothing worse than trybularyon and persecutyon / they hate all
things that open and show unto the^ their fautes / infyrmyties and wekenesse
they abhor all instructyo^ of the amendment of their living* and for a
conclusyon / they hate al thing contrary unto their pleasure.

The faithful love nothing but god having no delight in them selves / neither
love any thige carnally but love that thing that is contrary to their
concupyscence and desires / and above all things they receive thankful the
cross of Christ / which is trybulation / afflyction and persecution / and
have the^ in great favor which show them their fautes / abhorrynge all
flaterers / avoiding and flyenge to their power all errors / distroyeng the
knowledge of god / hatyng all thing that lets the correctyon and
punysshment of ^yces / loath to meddle with any thing contrary unto the will of
god / ^reuounsynge that which is of the world. And in as much as their will /
their ^ences and ^^^endment / which be but flesshly / be of the world they
forsake and utterly renounce themself ^in that that they refuse the devil and
all his powpes / and by these menes they acco^plyssh the word of god which
says / that he yt will not forsake hiself shall not be his disciple So he does
also at the ^aptun wha^ he says. I renounce Satan and all his pompes, In the
which baptim there is a great abusyon now / as well as in many other
ordynances of the church / for the child knows not what is said / nor the
godfaders nor the priest that baptyseth many times. And this is done by the
prestes / because they would be made much of and order all thing at their
pleasure the better / saying all in Latyne / where as the simple people
understand nothing / which is against the commandment of god and ordinance
of the apostle / which commands that such manner of folk prayeng or speaking
on that manner keep silence in the congregation or church / or else that they
speak that men may understand them.

By these things above said may you understand that there shall never be peace
between the world and the spirit / and that the worldly ^hal never love ye
faithful / but shall ^uermore persecute them by conty^uall battle / and
because we have ^o great and fearful an enemy / whom it is impossyble to
resyste / if we be ^at well armed. We must ask of this noble instrument in
whom the ^olyghost wrought* we must enqui^e of this noble vessel of electyon*
^octour of the gentiles saint Paul / that armoure is necessary / and he ^yll
tell us that we should not be defended with armours and scyences ^f man /
neither by any relygyon or ^bseruacion / but with the armours of god. First of
all we must gyrde ^ur loins with the truth / so that ^ll our strength stand
in the truth / ^or our loins betoken strength (as it is written in Job). Than
our ^^rength may not be in vanytie and ^^synges as ar all the constitucions and
inuencions of man: for seeing that every man is a liar / that the which comes
from him must needs be a lesynge. Therefore we must setell our strength in
verite and truth which is Jesu christ / which gives us hatdynes / saying: Have
good confyde^ce and trust / I have ouercomen the world. Tha^ must we take the
breast plate of righteousness / that is Jesu Christ that is our iustycs and our
iustifycation. For in another place. s. Paul admonishes us that we cloth our
self with Jesu Christ / that is* that we have none other protectyon or any
other socoure to trust upon / but him only which is the sure and true
protectoure. Now / after this we must have our fete shode in the preparyng of
the gospel of peace that is / that our afflyction and lusts be mortifyed /
that we may walk after the spirit of god. And wha^ we have all this / we must
have the sheld of faith for to put of te^ptacio^s that they hurt not our
conscyences / havynge a sure belefe in the holy promyses of god / the which we
must se^e within our conscience / and not here and there as many have done /
whi^^e for lack of redynge and vndersta^^^nge holy scripture / have divided
^^e christen people into more sects than all the world is in besides.

^e must also have a sallet / that is ^ope of health * that is / that we have
^^re trust / that even as Jesus christ ^yed for us / even so we to be saved.
And even as thou have faith that he ^yed / so must thou have hope that ^e dyed
for the / for he that has not ^^is hope / can never have a full confidence in
god. For to confound ^lso all the adversaries of the faith ^e must gyrde us
with the sword ^^ ye* spirit / which is ye word of god. And how we must use
it our captain and heed has showed us. Wha^ the devil came to tempte him /
we read not that he took any thing to resyste him but the only word of god /
shewinge us that we should in all temptations have recourse unto that and be
contented with that.

In this point are the enemies of Jesu Christ greatly to be reproved / which
say that the lay people and worldly (for so they call them) ought not to read
the holy scripture nor for to commen of the word of god / as who says /
Christ spoke to clerks only and showed them only the secrets of his father /
and not to the vulgar and common lay people / in as much as the chief of his
discyples were fysshers and no doctors: and also he thanked his father that it
pleased him to hyde his secrets from the prudent and wise of this world and
had opened it to youn^elynges / that is / unto loles after the judgment of the
world. For that I can not merueyle enough of their madness which will forbid
or ^et the comen people to read the ho^y words of god / seeing that ever from
the beginning of the world god has chosen most simple and ^dyotes to the
understanding of the great misteryes which he has ^ydde from the great wise
and sage ^hen / the experyence of the which thing we se daily before our eyes.

But the out raged cloggers of men's consciences / which fear ^est their
gaynes and getting should be demynysshed / and that they should not eat so
many fat mor^lleg / as they do and have done before / feyng that they can
not pluck back the sheep of Christ (all stor^en and famysshed for the word
of god) replenisshed with the spirit of the devil / begin to blaspheme the
word of god / and above all thing the writynge of saint Paul / as yt know
these enemies of Christ did murmr behind my back / and yet had they
nothing to answer wha^ I was there / and therefore spoke they nothing before
me therein / for they knew well that by the grace of god I was fensed well
enough for them for to de^tes and confou^de their bestly words / reasons and
deuilissh objections. Therefore / if these belly bestes and fylthy swyne full of
ambicion and avarice / enemies to all truth / disceyuers of man's soul / and
bringers of it out of the right way / false christen men and very ypocrytes
make such obiectyon with you: How you know that the holy books that ye read
now conteyne the Gospell^ without that the church had appreued them / and
without the counsels is it appears in the decrees and de ^retalles / had
allowed them. Nat^ithstandynge that such questions ^e so folyssh / that it is
but folly to an^^er them: yet to the end that they ^sceyue not simple people /
even as ^^r master Christ asked the jews ^^ question / wha^ they asked him by
that power he did those things that ^^ did: for the questions be even and
pro^ded both of infydelyte. ye shall de ^au^de of the^ / what color ye popes
decrees and decretals have to cover ^e^ self and their fylthynesse: but i that
they allege wrongfully saint Paul and other works of the old and new
^^stame^t / by which thing they show ^ydently holy scripture ought to ^dge and
approve all things that ^^ good / and reprove all things ^t be naught / and
not to be judged ^^ reproved by any ma^mes learning For the holy scripture has
be given with so euydent and manifest signs and tokens that there is no doubt
of but it is of god / as y^ law which god gave by Moses / which no man douted
to be gods seeing that in so euydent a token it was given from the mountain
covered with fire and with clouds* Who was ever so hardye to judge one of the
books of Moses or of the Prophets? even so by more strong argument / the
books of the new Testament / which be so much more perfyte than the old: how
much more clearly they show Christ than the old. Also likewise as Jesus did
take no wytnes of men but only of the father: likewise the word of god is not
to be judged nor may not receive his authority o^ men / but only of god.
Therefore they that will judge it ^he very* And christ's. For in that they take
upon them to judge it / they exalte them self above it. He that exalts him
self above the word of god / exalts him self above god and the power of
god. And therefore these matters of decrees and other tradityons / as offerynges
/ tithes / and other inuentyons / with the which ^aynt Augustyne in his time
said That they were more charged and ^den than the Jews. But now that would
he say if he saw the abominable sort of laws and co^^ttucyons the which
they have ma^e to take the simple people in their ^ettes? And yet they color
them ^ith holy scripture / wrasti^ge and ^rithynge it at their own pleasure ^s
it appears by their decrees. For their laws had never be received ^ad they
not clokyd them with ho^e scripture. Now / because the faythefull Christen in
lokynge on the scripture should not know what holy horisons they be / and the
effect of their laws / as be these that prestes should not have wives by
laufull marriage / and that men should not eat of such meat as god sends
with gyuynge thanks: clean contrary to the commandment of god. And to the
end that these things should not be known / they have forbidden that any of
the lay people dispute of the faith / either openly or pryuely. For when one
reasons with them of such matters / he must hold his peace / or say as they
say / orels they will curse him and make an herityke on him: saying / that he
speaks more than becomes him / or to him belongs. And one of that sort
checked me ones / because I read the Bible / having not read before my
Philosophye / with the which they bring out of the right course all them
that be newly planted in the faith in all vniuersyties in christendom. But
this thing bassheth me but little: seeing that this ordinance is made clean
repugnaunt unto god / to the susteyninge of all ungracious scyences.

Therefore / well-beloved brother / take no regard unto the words of these
outraged dogs / but take unto you the word of god / which only can save
your soul. Study in that day and night / and in all places going and
coming / let that never slide out of your heart nor mind ^ll your study to
read and vnderstan^e these holy words in all humy^ytie of heart. For god
says: whom shall I regard / but him that has ^ meke heart / and a contryte
spirit ferynge my words. Therefore set ^l your confyde^ce in god / lokyng of
him only the grace to understand his right worthy words / gyuynge dilygence
to be obedyente to the holy mocyons of the spirit: so that at the last thou
may do those things that those holy words command / setting no regard
by any thing in the world: ye / though the Angels in heaven should tell the /
much less than if that men full of vanytie should go about to persuade the /
except that it be grounded upon the word of god / which can neither disceyue
nor be disceyued, wherefore it must be received purely without adding any
thing of man's thereto. For the word of god is so pure / so net* so clean /
and so parfyte / that it can suffer nothing to be mengled thereto. And for this
cause remember the rule which I have so often times inculcate unto you. Do that
only to the Lord which he commands you. Thou shalt add nothing thereto /
neither diminysshe any thing therfro. Remember also that by faith we be made
the members of Jesu Christ / and that is the thing which joins us unto him
and our conscyences. By faith we be made his espouses and by the reason of
this marriage he gives us all his good ^edes and merytes / all his
righteousness and holiness / and takes upon him all our sins which can not
noy him / seeing that he bare the^ on the cross and with the trybulacyon of
this world / made full satisfactyon for all. And so the soul has fyrme and
stable faith and charity / whi^he is given us when we be vned and made one
with Jesus / when he gives us his holy spirit / which ^oth conduyte and
guide us in the ^ight way / all the law is accomplysshed and fulfilled / as
ye may more largely understand / if ye dilygently read the scripture / as ye
do full well. In the which god give you grace to continue with the increase of
faith and spiritual understanding. The which give you he which hang on the
cross and did cancel the oblygacyon of faith / in which we were dettours /
and rose the third day to iustifye us / that having this understanding ye
may edifye your household in the fere of god and your neighbors to the
edifyenge of the very body of Jesu Christ / of the which we hope to be very
members / when his glory shall appear: even as we be now in this mortal life
by true and quick faith / the which we must pray him to augmente / to the end
that worthily we may offer up our body by ^rew ^ortifyeng of this old Adam
and evermore studyenge to be new borne / and so to be made a new creature
after the shappe of god / a man spiritual and interyor man.

The grace of the almighty father the peace of the mercyful Jesus / the
consolation of the most holy spirit be always with you. Amen.

I pray you have remembrance of me in your prayers / that I may worthily
walk in the holy word of god / to the glory of god. Amen.

Finis.
Of governors / as Judges / baylyfes / and other like / An information after
the gospel.
THe gospel is written for all persons / and for all estates of the world.
And there is no^e estate in the world / but that he may find in the gospel
how that he should live if that he will follow it. Let none think that he is
not bound to live after the gospel though he be never so great a person / be
he duke prince / emperor / or bishop: For god has commanded that the
gospel be preached to every creature / that is to say / to all mankind.
Before god there is no dyfferynge / neither distynction / whether thou be a
commen husband man or a governor of a town or of a country / noble or
unnoble / we have al promised at our baptysme the one as much as the other /
we have al taken one rule that is the teaching of the Gospel after the which
we must led and gonerne our life, We may not say / let the monks and
priests keep it for we have all promised at our baptysme y^ one as much as
the other. Wherefore when the lords will live as they should do after the
Gospel / they must first observe and keep two thiges / that is to say / mercy
and justice. And also that they know when they must be merciful / and when
they must use justice.

Than first it behooves that thine intent be to defend the rightuouse and
innocent / and so with the seculer right to come in aid unto the right of the
Gospel / reprouynge and rebukyng openly and without any favor all
vnrightousnesse / to thentent that the people may live freely under thy
protection / preserved from thieves / murderers / and from all manner oppressyon
and iniurye / as farreforth as is possible unto the / when thou do so thou
art gods servant. But it be houeth yt thou be well ware in such things to
aduenge thy self in thy judgment and that thou give no judgment nor sentence /
but only where you know yt thy judgment is ritful / and y^ neither for
hatred / envy / nor favor. and yet thou must do it with as great mercy and
compassyo^ / and as tenderly as you would cut of a corrupt member from thine
own body / which by the malice or corruption if you dydest let hi^ alone / would
corrupt thy hole body. It were also no hurt i^ this matter to keep ye ordinance
sometime made by Theodosius emperor / which ordained that non should be put to
death before that he had be^. xxx. days i^ prison to thente^t that in the mean
time he might be well aduysed to make answer^ and to thentent that ye judge
should cause no man to dye hastily and with out aduiseme^t / but yt he might
have time to cole his enchaffed courage

And wha^ any of ye cominalty should happen to do any evil by misfortune
against right and justice / the which has always before be^ of good ^yfe and
name / such a one may a judge help against the laws and procure his
delyuerau^ce without syn. For ^f it be so that ye law of Moses had ^o great
discretion that thereby they did not put them to death / which vn^arely and
because of mysaduenture had committed murder against their will. As it is
written in Deuteronomi. iiii. So that Moses had as^ygned. iii. cities / unto
which they that had committed homicyde by misfortune against their will / might
^^ye for their sauegarde. How much more should we that are Christen / that live
after the gospel / and love our enemies / have and keep discrecion and regard
in this manner.

This I say / to thente^t that ye iuges shall not think that they offend if
they help such. For wha^ they have hope and lyklyhod that the evil doer shall
amend they must be always mererfull / as Christ was unto ye woman which was
found in aduoutry. As ^. Joh. reherseth / Jo. viii. The temporal law must
obey and serve unto the gospel / it may in no wise be contrary thereunto /
wherefore if any thing therein be against the Gospel / than the te^porall law
must give place and perisshe in that point For we must always obey more unto
god than unto me^. As techeth us saint Paul. Actuu^. v. Them that we may amend
by warning we shall not correct them by justice. All that a judge may do without
sin in the cause of another / he may nan do it in his own. For non may
avenge his own injury / nor vere his Christen brother for his own profyt. as
it is before said / that the true christian never playneth unto the judge of the
injury that men do unto ^hi / but suffers all pacyently. As ^yth. s. Paul. ^.
Corin. vi. Now ^s sin yet always in you / because y^ ye have strife
together among ^ou. Why do ye natte rather suffer wrong? why do ye not rather
receyte hurt? It behooves the iuges to love delige^tly yt the one do not wrong
the other / without lokyng that every man should compain unto him / and ^ll
by charytie / sechynge nothing but the rest and quietness of their Christen
brother whom the evil people do oppress. The prophet Esaias reproves the
princes and judges that in their judgments and sentenes take regard unto
richesse / servynge their own profit / or be^ynge favor unto their fryndes
/ ^yenge on this wise.

^ They all loves bryves / they ^lowe toward / they judge natte unto the
Orphantes / and the cause of the wydowe enters not unto the They ought to
determyn the cause with good auysement / and as shortly as were possible *and
to exhort the parties to make brotherly appoynteme^t the one with the other /
she wi^ge them by the gospel that the christian ought not to have suit and
process among them. They ought to be very sorye of the dissentyon of their
christen brethren / and of the evil governance of evil doers. It behooves
also that the lords enforce the^ selves to put away all evil customs / and
that they forbid streytly that no young strong persons go on beggynge. For
thereof comes great evil / but shall constryne them to learn a craft. Thereto a
place in the Cyuyl law that forbids that no strong persons being in health
shall beg their breed. And therefore I merueyle greatly that the temporal
lords keep not this law / king that it is good and not contrary / but
agreeable unto the gospel / which commands that we that labor natte should
not eat.

The lords should procure and counsel the rich folk that they should do their
dtlygence to cause the poor ^onge folk to learn a craft / to then ^^nt that
they should not go a beggynge / and that they have none occasion to take the^
to the walet. The ^^alers should also ordeyne some honest prouisyon / that the
poor impotent / young children and old people that can not get breed / and
have not ^eherof to live / should not be con^^reyned to go from door to door:
but ^^ were rather better that they should ^^deyne. iii. or. iiii. honest
persons in every paryssh / which of a comen treasure / as of the treasure of
the poor / might provide every weke is much as should be need to every ^ouse
of the pore / and that by portion after the nombre of the poor. And that they
should exhort the rich to give their alms to that come^ treasure / and to be
queth that that they would bequeth by their testame^tes other ways to that
comen treasure, For we can find the mean to byld great abbeys for to nourysshe
in delycate living strong people that may labor / and sometime hores and
bawdes also. And why can we not as well find the means to do our charytable
works according to the gospel to the poor impotent / sick and feeble. We
should also bye houses for the poor to dwell in / as are the hospytalles /
sytuate in a fair plesaunt and large out of the town. and like wise should we
provide unto them an honest man that might every day make unto them a sermon
showing them the word of God for to comfort them in their pouertye and
langours / which should be a service honest / wholesome and very acceptable unto
god.

The office of all estates. i. Timo. iii.
A Bishop must be fautelesse / the husband of one wife / sobre / discrete /
houestly apparelled / herberouse / apt to teache / not dronken / no fyghter /
not given to fylthy lucre: but gentle / abhorryng fighting / abhorrynge
covetousness / and one that rules his own house honestly / having children
under obedyence with all honesty.

Rulers. Sap. t.
Ye that are rulers of the earth / se that you love righteousness / and that
you commit none unrighteousness in judgment. Leui. ix.

Thou shall not favor the poor nor honor the mighty: but shalt judge thy
neighbor rightuously.

The co^ens. Leui. xix.
Ye shall not disceyue your brethren / neither with weight nor measure: but shall
have true balances and true weightes / for I am ye lord your god

Husbands. Ephe. v.
Husbands / love your wives / even as Christ loves the congregatyon / and
gave him self for it to sa^ctifye it / and cleansed it in the fountain of
water through the word / to make it unto himself a gloriouse co^gregatyon
without spotte or wryncle or any such thing.

So ought men to love their wives / as their own bodies. He that loves his
wife / loves him self. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh but
nourisshed it. etc.

Wives. Ephe. v.
Wives submytte your selves to your own busbandes / as unto the lord. For the
husband is the wives heed / even as Christ is the heed of the congregation.
Therefore as the Congregatyon is in subiectyon to Christ: like wise let ye wives
be i^ sub^ectio^ to their husbands in all things.

Fathers and moders. Ephesians. vi
Ye fathers / move not your children so wrath / but bring the^ up with the
nurter and information of the lord

Children. Ephe. vi.
Children / obey your fathers and mothers in ye lord / for so it is right ^^
Honor thy father and mother (that is the first commandment that has any
promys) that thou may be in good estate and live long on therth

Masters, Collo. iii.
Ye masters / do unto your servants that which is just and egalle / putting
away all bytternesse and thret^enynges / knowing that even ye have also a
master in heaven.

Servants. Collo. iii.
Servants / be obedyent unto your bodily masters in all things ^at with eye
service as men plesers but in synglenes of heart feryng god And whatsoever ye do
/ do it herteli as though ye did it unto the lord / and not unto men / for as
much as ye know that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of inherytance
for ye serve the lord Christ.

Wydowes. i, Timo. v.
She that is a very wydo we and friendless / puts her trust in god and
contynueth in supply catyon and prayer / night and day.

The so^me of all.
Love thy neybour as thy self / and what so ever ye would that other should do
to you / do you even the same to them: and what ye would not that other men
should do to you se that ye do it not to them.
