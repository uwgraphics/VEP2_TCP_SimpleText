A pretty new Ballad, intytuled: The Crow sits upon the wall, Please one and
please all.
To the tune of, Please one and please all.

Please one and please all,
Be they great be they small,
Be they little be they low,
So pypeth the Crow,
sitting upon a wall:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
BE they white be they black,
Have they a smock on their back,
Or a kircher on her head,
Whether they spin silk or thread,
whatsoever they them call:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
Be they sluttish be they gay,
Love they work or love they play,
Whatsoever be their cheer,
Drink they Ale or drink they beer,
whether it be strong or small:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
Be they sower be they sweet,
Be they shrewish be they meek,
Wear they silk or cloth so good,
Ueluet Bonnet or French-hood,
Upon her head a Cap or call:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
Be they halt be they lame,
Be she Lady be she dame,
If that she do wear a pin,
Keep she tavern or keep she Inn,
Either bulk bouth or stall,
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
The goodwife I do mean,
Be she fat or be she lean,
Whatsoever that she be,
This the Crow told me,
sitting upon a wall:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
If the goodwife speak aloft,
See that you then speak soft,
Whether it be good or ill,
Let her do what she will:
and to keep your self from thrall,
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
If the goodwife be displeased,
All the whole house is diseased,
And therefore by my will,
To please her learn the skill,
Least that she should always brall:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
If that you bid her do ought,
If that she do it not,
And though that you be her goodman,
You your self must do it than,
be it in kitchen or in hall:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
Let her have her own will,
Thus the Crow pypeth still,
Whatsoever she command,
See that you do it out of hand,
whensoeur she does call:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
Be they wanton be they wild,
Be they gentle be they mild:
Be she white be she brown,
Does she skould or does she frown,
Let her do what she shall:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
Be she coy be she proud,
Speak she soft or speak she loud,
Be she simple be she flaunt,
Does she trip or does she taunt,
the Crow sits upon the wall:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
Is she huswife is she none,
Does she drudge does she groan,
Is she nimble is she quick,
Is she short is she thick,
Let her be what she shall:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
Be they rich be they poor,
Is she honest is she whore,
Wear she cloth or Ueluet brave,
Does she beg or does she crave,
Wear she hat or silken call:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
Be she cruel be she cursed,
Come she last come she first,
Be they young be they old,
Do they smile do they skould,
though they do naught at all:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
Though it be some Crows guise,
Oftentimes to tell lies,
Yet this Crows words does try,
That her tale is no lie,
For thus it is and ever shall:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
Please one and please all,
Be they great be they small,
Be they little be they low,
So pipeth the Crow,
sitting upon a wall:
please one and please all,
please one and please all.
FINIS.
