The obedience of a Christen man and how Christian rulers ought to govern /
where in also (if thou mark diligently) thou shall find eyes to perceave the
crafty conveyau^ce of all iugglers.

William Tyndale other wise called William Hychins unto the Reader.
GRace / peace and increase of knowleage in our lord Jesus Christ be with ye
Reader and with all that call on ye name of the lord unfeignedly and with a
pure conscience Amen.

Lat it not make the dispeare nether yet discorage ye o Reader / that it is
forbeden the in pain of life and goods or that it is made breakinge of the
kings peace or treason unto his hynes to read the word of thy souls health.
But much rather be bold in the lord and comfort thy soul. The nature of
Gods word is lo be persecuted.
For as much as thou art sure and have an evidente token through soch
persecucion that it is the true word of God. Which word is ever hated of ye
world / nether was ever without persecucio^ (as thou seist in all the stories
of ye bible both of the new testamente and also of the old) nether can be / no
moare then the son can be without his light. The pope is received and
receaveth and persecuteth.
And for as much as contrary wise thou art sure that the Popes doctrine is not
of God which (as thou seist) is so agreeable unto ye world / and is so received
of the world or which rather so receaveth the world and the pleasures of the
world / and seeks no thing but the possessions of the world / and auctorite
in the world / and to bear a rule in ye world / and persecuteth ye word of
God / and with all wilynes drives the people from it / and with false and
sophistical reasons makes the^ aferde of it: ye curses them and
excomunicateth them / and brings them in belefe that they be damned / if they
look on it / and that it is but doctrine to deceave men / and moves the blind
powers of ye world to sley with fire / water and sword all that cleve unto
it. For the world loves yt which is his / and hates that which is chosen out
of the world to sarve God in ye sprite. As Christ says to his disciples
Ioha^nis. xv. If ye were of the world / the world would love his own. But I
have chosen you out of the world and therefore the world hates you A another
confort have thou / that as the weak powers of the world defend the doctrine
of the world so the mighty powere of God defends the doctrine of God. God
defends his doctrine him self.
Which thing thou shall evide^tly perceave / if thou call to mind ye
wonderful deades which God has ever wrought for his word in extreme
necessite sens the world began beyounde all man's reason. Which are written as
says Paul (Romanorum. xv.) for our lerninge (and not for our deceavinge)
that we through patience / and conforte of the scripture might have hope. Gods
word fights agenst ypocrites
The nature of Gods word is to fight against ypocrites. It began at Abell and
has ever sens continued and shall / I doubt not / until the last day. And
the ypocrites have allwaye the world on their sides / as thou seist in time of
Christ. How our master christ was entreated.
They had the elders / that is to were the rulers of the Jews / on their side.
They had Pilate and the emperors power on their side. They had Herod also on
their side. Moare over they brought all their worldly wisdom to pass and all
yt they could think or imagen to serve for their purpose. First to fear the
people with all / they excomunicated all that beleved in him / and put them out
of the temple / as thou seist John. ix. The craft of the ypocrites.
Secondly they found the means to have him condemned by the Emperors power
and made it treason to Ceser to beleve in him. Thridly they obtained to have
him hanged as a thief or a mortherer / which after their belly wisdom was a
cause above all causes / that no man should beleve in him. For the Jews take
it for a sure token of everlastinge damnacion if a man be hanged. For it is
written in their law. Deuteromion. xxj. cursed is whosoever hangs on tree.
Moses also in ye same place commands / if any man be hanged / to take him
down the same day and bury him / for fear of pollutinge or defylinge the
country / that is / lest they should bring the wrath and curse of God upon
them. And therefore the weked Jews them selves / which with so venoumous hate
persecuted the doctrine of Christ and did all the shame that they could do
unto him (though they would feign have had Christ to hang still on the cross
and there to rotte / as he should have done by the Emperors law / yet for
fear of defylinge their sabbath and of bringinge the wrath and curse of god
upon them) bedgett of Pylate to take him down. John. xix. Which was agenst
them selves. Finally when they had done all they could and that they thought
sufficient / and when Christ was in the heart of the earth and so many bylles
and pollaxes about him / to keep him down / and when it was past ma^s help:
then help God. When man could not bri^ge him again / Gods truth works
wonders and makes the wisdom of the ypocrites folishnes.
Gods truth fette him again. The oath yt God had sworn to Abraham / to David
and to other holy fathers and prophets raised him up again / to bless and
to save all that beleve in him. Thus became the wisdom of the ypocrites
folishnes. Loo this was written for thy lerninge and comfort. The captivite of
the Israelytes under Pharao


How wonderfully ware the chylderne of Israel locked in Egipte? In what
tribulacion / combraunce and aduersite were they in? The lord also that was
promised the^ / was far of and full of great cities walled with hie walls
up to the sky and enhabited with great geauntes. Yet Gods truth brought
the^ out of Egipte and planted the^ in the land of the geauntes. This was also
written for our lerninge / For their is no power ^ge^st Gods ne^her any wisdom
against gods wisdom / he is stronger and wiser the^ all his enimyes What help
it Pharao to drou^de ye me^ childerne? So little / I fear not / shall it at ye
last help ye Pope and his bisshappes to burn our Pharao ^^eith the men
childern.
men childerne which manfully confess that Jesus is ye lord and that there is
no another name geven unto men to be saved by / as Peter testifies Acts in
the.iiij. chapter. Who dried up the redd see? Who sl^ew Golias? Who did all
those wonderful deades which thou read in the bible? Who delivered the
Israelites evermore from thraldom and bondage / as soon as they repented and
turned to God? Faith verily and Gods truth and the trust in the promyses which
he had made. Read the.xj chapter to the Hebrews for thy consolacion.

When the childerne of Israel were ready to dispeare for the greatness and ye
multitude of the Geauntes / Moses conforted them ever saying. Now Moses
conforteth the israelites
Remember what your lord God has done for you in Egipte / his wonderful
plages / his miracles his wonders / his mighty hand / his stretched out arm /
and what he has done for you hitherto. He shall distroye them / he shall take
their hertes from them and make them fear and flee before you. He shall storm
them and stere up a tempest among them and scater them and bring the^ to
naught. He has sworn / he is true / he will fulfill the promyses that he
has made unto Abraham / Isaac and Jacob This is written for our lerninge.
Gods truth fights for us
For verily he is a true God / and is our God as well as theirs / and his
promyses are with us as well as with them / and he present with us as well as
he was with them. If we ask we shall opteyne / if we knock he will open / if
we seek we shall find / if we thurst / his truth shall fulfill our lust.
Christ is with us until the worlds end Matthew the last. Lat litleflocke
bebolde therefore. For if God be on our side: what matter makes it who be
agenst us / be they bisshoppes / cardenals / popes or what so ever names they
will.

Mark this also / if God send the to the sea and promise to goo with ye and
to bring the saffe to land / God tries the faith of his childern.
he will reyse up a tempest agenst the / to prove whether thou will abide by
his word / and that thou may feale thy faith and perceave his goodness / For
if it were all ways fair wether and thou never brought in to soch ieoperdy
whence his mercy only delyvered the / thy faith should be but a presompcio^ and
thou should be ever unthankful to God and mercylesse unto thy neyboure.

If God promise riches / ye way thereto is pouerte. God works backwarde.
Whom he loves him he chasteneth / whom he exalts / he casts down / whom
he saves he da^neth first. He brings no man to heaven except he send him to
hell first. If he promise life he sleyeth first / when he byldeth / he casts
all down first. He is no patcher / he can not bylde on a another man's
foundation. He will not work until all be past remedy and brought unto soch a
case / that men may se how that his hand / his power / his mercy / his goodness
and truth has wrought all to gether. He will let no man be partetaker with
him of his praise and glory. His works are wonderful and contrary unto ma^s
works. Who ever save he delyvered his own son / his only son / his dear
son unto the deeth and that for his enemies sake / to win his eni^^e / to
overcome him with love / that he might se love and love again and of love to
do like wise to other men / and to overcome the^ with well doing? Joseph.


Joseph saw ye son and the moon and xi. sterres worshepinge him.
Nevertheless yer that came to pass / God laid him where he could nether se
son ner moan nether any star of the sky / and that many years and also
undeserved / to nurtoure him / to humble / to meke and to teach him Gods ways
/ and to make him apt and mete for the rowme and honor agenst he came to it
that he might perceave and feale that it came of God / and that he might be
strong in the sprite to mynister it Godly.

He promised the childerne of Israel a land with rivers of milk and honey.
Israelites.
But brought them for the space of forty years in to a land where not only
ryvers of milk and honey were not / but where so much as a drop of water was
not / to nurtoure them and to teach them as a father does his son / and to
do them good at the later end / and that they might be strong in there
sprite and souls to use his gifts and benefits Godly and after his will.

David
He promised David a kingdom and immediately stered up king Saul agenst him /
to persecute him / to hunt him as me^ do hares with grehoundes and to feret
hi^ out of every hole and yt for ye space of many years to tame him / to meke
hi^ / to kill his lusts to make him feale other men's diseases / to make him
merciful / to make him understand that he was made king to myniste^ and to
serve his brethren and that he should not think that his subjects were made
to mynister unto his lusts / and that it were lawful for him to take away
from them life and goods at his pleasure.

O that our kings were so nurtered now adays / which our holy bysshopes
teach of a far other manner saying / your grace shall take his pleasure: How
bisshopes instruct kings.
ye take what pleasure ye lust / spare nothing. We shall dispe^ce with you: we
have power / we are gods vicars. And let us alone with the realm. We shall take
pain for you and se y^ nothing be well. your grace shall but defend ye faith
only

Let us therefore look dilligently where unto we are called / that we disceave
not our selves. where un to a christian is called.
We are called / not to dispute as the Popes disciples do / but to dye with
Christ that we may lyve with him / and to sofre with him that we may regne
with him Our fighti^ge is to sofre while god fi^hteth for us*
. We be called unto a ki^gdome that must be won with sofringe only / as a
seek man wins health. God is he that does all thing for us and fyhgteth
for us and we do but sofre only. Christ says Ioh. xx. As my father sent me /
so send I you. and Ioh. xv. If they persecute me then shall they persecute
you. And Mat. x. says Christ. I send you forth as sheep among wolves. The
sheep fight not: but the sheparde fyghteth for the^ and cares for them. Be
harmeles as doves therefore / says Christ / and wise as serpents. The doves
imagen no defense ner seek to avenge them selves. The wisdom of the serpente
The serpents wisdom is to keep his heed and those parts wherein his life
rests. Christ is our heed and Gods word is that wheri^ our life rests To
cleve therefore fast unto Christ and unto those promyses which God has made us
for his sake is our wisdom. Beware of men (says he) for they shall delyver
you up unto their councels and shall scourge you. And ye shall be brought
before rulars and kings for my sake. The brother shall betraye or delyver the
brother to deeth and the father the son. And ye childerne shall rise agenst
father and mother / and put them to deeth. Here what Christ says moare. The
disciple is not greater the^ his master nether the servaunte greater or better
the^ his lord. If they have called the goodman of the house Beelzebub / how
much rather shall they call his household sarvauntes so? And Luke. xiiij. says
Christ. Which of you desposed to bylde a toure / sits not down first and
counts the cost whether he have sufficie^te to perform it? lest when he has
laid the fundacion and then not able to perform it / all that behold begin
to mock him saye^ge / He makes a mock of him self that casts not the end
ye^ he begin.
this man began to bylde and was not able to make an end. So like wise none of
you that forsakes not all that he has can be my disciple. Whosoever therefore
casts not this before hand. I must ieoperde life / goods honor / worshepe
and all that there is for Christ's sake / disceaveth him self and makes a
mock of him self unto the godless ypocrites and infidels. No man can serve
two masters God and ma^mon / that is to say / weked riches also Mathe. vj.
Thou must love christ above all thing. But that do thou not if thou be not
ready to forsake all for his sake / if thou have forsake all for his sake /
the^ art thou suer that thou love him. How is the pope sure which takes all
for Christ's sake but forsakes naught:
Tribulacion is our right baptim and is signified by plunginge in to the
water / we that are baptized in the name of Christ (says Paul To. vj.) are
baptized to dye with him Tribulation is our bapti^.


The spirit through tribulacion purges us and kills our fleshly wit /
our wordly understanding and belly wisdom / and fills us full of the
wisdom of God. Tribulacion is a blessinge that comes of God / as witneseth
Christ Mathei. v. Blessed are they that sofre persecucio^ for rightewesnessis
sake / for there is is the kingdom of heven. Tribulation is a blessing
Is this not a confortable word? Who ought not rather to chose and desire to
be blessed with Christ in a little tribulacion / than to be cursed perpetually
with the world for a little pleasure?

Prosperity is a curse:
Prosperity is a right curse and a thing that God geveth unto his enymies. Woe
be to you rich says Christ Luke. vj. Lo ye have your consolacion / woo be to
you that are full / for ye shall hongre / woo be to you that laugh / for ye
shall weep / woo be to you when men praise you. For so did their fathers unto
the false prophets: ye and so have our fathers done unto the false
ypocrites. The ypocrites with worldly preachinge have not gotten the praise only
/ but even the possessions also and the dominion and rule of the whole world.

Tribulacion for rigthteousnes is not a blessinge only. Tribulation is the
gift of God.
But also a gift that God geveth unto none save his special friends. The
apostles / Acts. v. reioysed that they were counted worthy to sofre rebuke for
Christ's sake. And Paul in the second pistle and thread chapter to Timotheum
says. All that will lyve Godly in Christ Jesus must sofre persecucion. And in
the first chapter of his pistle to the Philippiens he says. Unto you it is
geven not only to beleve in Christ: But also to sofre for his sake. Here se^st
thou that it is Gods gift to sofre for Christ's sake. And Peter in the fourth
Chapter off his first Pistle says. Happy are ye / if ye sofre for the name of
Christ / for the glorious sprite of God rests in you. Is it not an happy
thing to be sure that thou art sealed with Gods spirit unto everlastinge
life? And verily thou art sure thereof / if thou sofre patiently for his sake
whereby then ar the pope and bisshappes sure?
. By sofri^ge art thou sure. But by persecutinge can thou never be sure.

For Paul in the fyft chapter to the Romans says. Tribulacion makes feali^ge
/ that is / it makes us feale the goodness of God and his help and the
workynge of his sprite. And in the twelfe chapter of the second pistle to the
Corrinthyans the Lord said to Paul / my grace is sufficie^te for the. For my
strength is made perfect through wekenes. Lo Christ is never strong in us /
till we be weke. As our strength abateth / so grows the strength of Christ
in us / when we are clean empted of our own strength / the^ are we full of
Christ's strength. And look how much of our own strength remains in us / so
much lacks there of the strength of Christ. Therefore says Paul in the said
place of his second Pistle to the Corrinthea^s. Very gladly will I rejoice in
my weakness / that the strength of Christ may dwell in me. There fore have I
delectacio^ says Paul in infirmytes / in rebukes in neade / in persecucions
and in anguysh for Christ's sake. ffor when I am weak / then am I strong /
meaning that the weakness of the flesh is the strength of the sprite. Flesh:
And by flesh understand wit / wisdom and all that is in a man before the
sprite of God come / and what so ever springs not of the sprite of God and of
Gods word. And of like testimonies is all the scripture full.

Behold God sets before us a blessinge and also a curse. A blessinge verily
and that a glorious and an everlastinge / if we will sofre tribulacion and
adversite with our lord and savioure Christ. And an everlastinge curse / if
for a little pleasures sake we withdraw our selves from the chastisinge and
nurtoure of God / wherewith he teaches all his sons and fascioneth them after
his godly will and makes them perfect (as he did Christ) and makes them
apt and mete vessels to receave his grace and his sprite / that they might
perceave and feale the exceadinge mercy which we have in Christ and the
innumerable blessings / and the unspeakable enheritaunce where unto we are
called and chosen and sealed in our savioure Jesus Christ / unto whom be
praise for ever Amen.

Finally whom God choseth to regne everlastingly with Christ him seals he
with his myghtie sprite and powers strength in to his heart to sofre
affliccions also with Christ for beringe wittenes unto the troth. The
difference between the childern of God and of the deuell.
And this is the difference between the childerne of God and of salvation and
between the childerne of the devyll and of damnacio^ / that the childerne of
God have power in their hertes to sofre for gods word which is their life and
salvation / their hope and trust and whereby they lyve in the soul and sprite
before God. And ye childerne of the devyll in time of adversite fle from
Christ whom they followed faynedly / their hertes not sealed with his holy and
mighty sprite / and get them to the stondert of their right father the devell
/ and take The devels w^ges.
his wages / the pleasures of this world. Which are the ernest of everlastinge
damnacion. Which conclusion the.xij. chapter to the Hebrews well confirms
saying. My son despice not ye chastisinge of the lord / nether faynte when
thou art rebuked of him. For whom the lord loves him he chasteseth: ye and
he scourges All Gods childern are under chastisynge.
every son whom he receaveh Loo persecucion and adversite for the truth sake
is Gods scourge and Gods rod and pertayneth unto all his childerne
indifferently. For when he says / he scourges every son / he makes none
excepcion. Moare over says the text / if ye shall endure chastysynge / God
offers him self unto you / as unto sons. What son is it that the father
chastises not? If ye be not under correccion (where of all are partetakers)
then are ye bastardes and not sons.

For as much then as we must needs be baptized in tribulacions and through ye
read see and a great and a fearful wilderness and a land of cruel Geauntes
in to our natural contre: ye and in as much as it is a plain ernest / that
there is no Which way goo the bisshapes to heven then?
another way in to the kyngedome of life / then through persecucion and
soferinge of pain and of very deeth / after the ensample of Christ. Therefore
let us arm our souls with ye comfort of the scriptures. How that God is
ever ready at hand in time of need to help us. And how that soch tyrauntes
and persecuters are but Gods scourge and his rod to chastise us. And as ye
father has allwaye in time of correccio^ the rod fast in his hand / so
that the rod does nothing but as the father moves it: even so has God all
The tira^tes have not power to do what they would:
Tyrauntes in his hand and lets them not do what so ever they would / but
as much only as he appoints them to do and as ferforth as it is necessary
for us. And as when the child submits him self unto his fathers correccion
and nurtoure and humbles him self all to gether unto the will of his father /
the^ the rod is taken away: even so when we are come unto the knowleage of
the right way and have forsaken our own will and offer our selves clean
unto the will of God / to walk which way so ever he will have us: the^
turns he y^ tyrau^tes. Or else if they enforce to persecute us any forther /
he puts the^ out of ye way accordi^ge unto ye confortable ensamples of the
scripture.

Moare over let us arm our souls with the promyses both of help and
assiste^ce and also of the glorious reward that follows. The promises of God
are comfortable ye they are all comfort.
Great is your reward in heven says Christ Math. v. And he yt knowleageth
me before men him will I knowledge before my father yt is in heve^ Mathe. x. And
call on me in time of tribulacion and I will delyver the psalm.lxv. And
behold ye eyes of the lord are over the^ that fear him and over the^ that
trust in his mercy. To delyver their souls from deeth and to feed them in time
of hongre psalm.xlvj. And in the.xlvij. psalm. says David: the lord is nigh
them that are trobled in their hertes / and the meke in sprite will he save.
The tribulacions of the righteous are many / and out of them all will the
lo^rde delyver them. The lord keeps all the bones of them / so that not one
of them shall be brosed. The lord shall redeem ye souls of his servauntes. And
of soch like consolacion are all ye psalms full: would to God when ye read
them ye understood the^ / and Math. x. When ye delyver you take no thought what
ye shall say. It shall be geven you the same hour what ye shall say. For it is
not ye that speak: But the sprite of your father which speaks in you The
very hears of your heedes are numbered says Christ also Mathe^. in the
te^the If God care for our hears / he much moare cares for our souls which
he has sealed with his holy sprite. There fore says Peter. j. Petr. iiij. Cast
all your care upon him: for he cares for you* And Paul.j. Corint. x. says:
God is true he will not sofre you to be tempted above your might. And
psalm.lxxj. Cast thy care apo^ ye lord.

Let thy care be to prepare thy self with all thy strength for to walk which
way he will have the and to beleve that he will goo with the and assiste the
and strength the agenst all tyrauntes and delyver the out of all tribulation. A
christian ma^s care
But what way or by what means he will do it / that commit unto him and to
his Godly pleasure and wisdom and cast that care upon him. And though it seem
never so unlikely or never so impossible unto natural reason / yet beleve
steadfastly that he will do it. And then shall he according unto his old use
change the course of the world / even in the twinkelinge of an eye / and come
suddenly upon our Geauntes as a thief in the night / and compass them in
their wiles and worldly wisdom / when they cry peace and all is saffe / then
shall their sorrows begin / as the panges of a woman that traveleth with
child. And then shall he dystroye them / and delyver the / unto the glorious
praise of his mercy and truth. Amen.

ANd as perteynynge unto them yt despise Gods word / countinge it as a
phantasy or a dream / and to them also that for fear of a little persecucion
fall from it / set this before thine eyes. The dispisers persecuters and they
that fall from the word are threateaed.
How God sens the beginnynge of the world / before a general plage / ever
sent his true prophets and preachers of his word / to warn the people / and
gave them space to repent. But they for the grettest part of them hardened
their hertes and persecuted the word that was sent to save the^. And then God
destroyed them utterly and took them clean from the earth. As thou seist what
followed the preachi^ge of Noe
Noe in ye old world / what followed ye preachi^ge of Loath
Loath among the sodomites and ye preachi^ge of Moses and Moses and Aaron:
Aaron among the Egipcia^s / and that suddenly agenst all possibilyte of man's
wit. Moare over as often as ye childerne of Israel fell from God to ye
worshepinge of images / he sent his The prophets
Prophets unto the^. And they persecuted and waxed hard herted. And the^ he
sent the^ in to all places of ye world captive. Christ.
Last of all he sent his own son unto the^. And they waxed moare hard
herted the^ ever before. And se what a fearful example of his wrath and cruel
vengeance he has made of them unto all the world now almost fyftene hundred
years.

Unto the old britons / also which dwelled where our nation now does /
Preached Gyldas and rebuked them of their wekednes and prophesied both unto ye
spiritual (as they will be called) and unto the lay men also / what ve^gaunce
would follow except they repented. Gildas They be spiritual: that is develish:
for the devil is a sprite.
But they waxed herd hearted. And God sent his plages and pestilences among
them / and sent their enemies in upon them on every side and destroyed them
utterly.

Mark also how Christ threatens the^ that forsake him for what so ever cause
it be: Whether for fear / either for shame / either for loss of honor /
friends / life or goods? He that denies me before men / him will I deny
before my father that is in heven. He that loves father or mother moare the^
me / is not worthy of me. All this says he Math the tenth. And in the.viij. of
mark he says. Whosoever is ashamed of me or my words among this advoutours
and synnefull generation: of him shall the son of man be ashamed / when he
comes in the glory of his father with his holy angels. And Luke. ix. also:
None that lays his hand to the plowe and looks back / is mete for the
kyndome of heven.

Never the less yet if any man have resisted ignorantly / as Paul did / let
him look on the truth which Paul wrote after he came to knowledge. God
receavith the^ that come again
Also if any man clean agenst his heart / but overcome with the wekenes of the
flesh for fear of persecucion / have denied / as Peter did / or have delyvered
his book or put it away secretlye. Let him (if he repent) come again and
take better hold and not dispeare or take it for a sign that God has
forsaken him. Why god lets his elect fall:
For God oftimes takes his strength eve^ from his very elect / when they
other trust in their own strength or are negligente to call to him for his
strength. And that does he to teach them and to make them feale that in ye
fire of tribulacion for his words sake nothing ca^ endure and abide / save
his wor^ and ye strength only which he has promised For which strength he will
have us to pray unto him night and day withal instau^ce

THat thou may perceave how yt ye scripture ought to be in ye mother tongue
and yt ye reasons which our sprites make for ye contrary are but sophistry and
false wiles to fear ye from ye light yt, thou mighteste follow them
blyndefolde and be their captive / to honor their ceremonies and to offer to
their belly. That the scripture ought to be in the english tongue


First god gave ye childerne of israel a law by ye ho^de of moses in their
mother tongue. and al ye prophets wrote i^ their mother tongue. and all the
psalms were in ye mother tongue. And there was Christ but fygured and
described in ceremonies / in redles / in parables and in dark prophesies. What
is the cause that we may not have the old testamente with the new also which
is ye light of the old and wherein is openly declared before the eyes that
there was darkely prophesied? I can imagen no cause verily except it be that
we should not se the work of Antychrist and iugulynge of ypocrites. what
should be the cause that we which walk in the broad day / should not se / as
well as they that walked in the night / or that we should not se as well at
none / as they did in the twylighte? Came Christ to make the world moare
blind? By this means Christ is the darkness of the world and not the light
/ as he says him self John. viij.

Moare over Moses says Deutro. vj. Hear Israel let these words which I
command the this day steke fast in thine heart / and whette them on thy
childerne and talk of the^ as thou sit in thine house / and as thou
walk by the way / and when thou lie down / and when thou risest up /
and bind the^ for a token to thine hand / and let the^ be a remembrance
between thine eyes / and write the^ on ye posts and gates of thine house. This
was commanded generally unto all me^. how comes it that Gods word perteneth
less unto us tha^ unto the^? Ye how comes it that our Moyseses forbydde us
and command us the contrary / and threate us if we do / and will not that we
once speak of Gods word? How can we whette gods word (that is put it in
practyse / use and exercise) upon our childerne and household / when we are
violently kept from it and know it not? How can we (as Peter comma^deth) geve
a reason of our hope when we wot not what it is that God has promised or
what to hope? Moses also co^ma^deth in ye said chapter: if the son ask what
the testimonies laws and observau^ces of the lord mean that ye father teach

ware) mean No ner sir John his goostly childerne
No father ca^ tell his son. And in the.xj. chapter he repeteth all again
for fear of for getting.

They will say happly / ye scripture requires a pure mind and a quiet
mind. And therefore ye lay man because he is altogether co^bred with wordly
busynes / ca^ not understood the^. If yt be the cause / the^ it is a plain
case / that our prelates understood not the scriptures them selves. For no
lay man is so tangled with wordly busynes as they are. The great things of
ye world are ministered by them. Nether do ye lay People any great thing /
but at their assignemente

If the scripture were in the mother tongue they will say / then would the lay
people understood it every man after his own ways. Where fore serves the
curate / but to teach the^ the right way? Where fore were the Holidayes
holidays made / but that the people should come and learn? Are ye not
abhomynable Our scolemasters take great wages but teach not.
scolemasters / in that ye take so great wages / if ye will not teach? If ye
would teach how could ye do it so well and with so great profitt / as when the
lay people have the scripture before them in their mother tongue? For the^
should they se by the order of the text / whether thou iugledest or not. And
then would they beleve it / because it is the scripture of God / though thy
lyvinge be never so abominable. Why the preachers are not beleved when they
say troth.
Where now because your lyvinge and your preachinge are so contrary / and
because they grope out in every sermon your open and manifest lies / and
smell your insatiable covetousnes they beleve you not / when you preach
troth. But alas / the curates them selves (for the most part) wot no moare
what the new or old testamente means / then do the turks. The curates
wotte not what a bibyll means
Nether know they of any moare then that they read at mass / mate^s and
evensonge which yet they understand not. Nether care they but even to mumble
up so much every day (as the pie and popyngay speak the wot not what) to
fill their belyes with all. If they will not lat the lay man have the word of
God in his mother tongue / yet let the prestes have it / which for a great
part of the^ do understood no latin at all: The prestes understand no
laten.
but sing and say and patter all day / with the lyppes only / that which the
heart understands not.

Christ commands to sherch the scriptures John. v. Sherch the scriptures
Though that miracles bare record unto his doctrine / yet desired he no faith
to be geven either unto his doctrine or unto his miracles / without record of
the scripture. When Paul preached / Acts. xvij. the other sherched ye
scriptures daily / whether they were as he alleged the^. Why shall not I like
wise se / whether it be the scripture ye thou allegest: ye why shall I not se
the scripture and the circumstances and what goes before and after / that I
may know whether thine interpretacio^ be the right sense / or whether thou
iuglest and drawest the scripture violently unto thy carnal and fleshly
purpose? or whether thou be about to teach me or to disceave me.

Christ says that there shall come false prophets in his name and say that
they them selves are Christ / that is / they shall so preach Christ that men
must beleve in them in their holiness and things of their imaginacion without
Gods word: ye and that agenst Christ or Antichriste that shall come is no
thing but soch false prophets that shall iuggle / with the scripture and
begile the people with false interpretacions as all the false prophets /
scribes and pharisees did in ye old testame^te. How shall I know whether ye are
that agenste christ or false prophets or no / saying ye will not let me se
how ye allege the scriptures? Christ says: Against Christ is known by his
deades
By their deades ye shall know them. Now when we look on your deades / we se
that ye are all sworn to gether and have separated your selves from the lay
people / and have a several ki^gdome among your selves and several laws of
your own making / where with ye violently bind the lay people that never
consented unto the making of the^. A severell ki^gdom

Seuerell laws.

what chrisi lowseth freely the pope byndeth to lowse it again for money

A secret counsel


A thowsande things forbydde ye which christ made free / and dispe^se with
them again for money. Nether is there any excepcio^ at all / but lack of
money. Ye have a secret council by your selves. All other men's councels and
secrets know ye and no man yours. ye seek but honor / riches / promocio^ /
auctorite and to regne over all / and will obey no man. If the father geve you
ought of courtesy / ye will compel the son to geve it violently whether he
will or not by craft of your own laws. These deades are agenst Christ. When
an hole parysh of us hyre a scolemaster to teach our childerne / what reason
is it that we should be compelled to pay this scolemaster his wages / and he
should have lycens to goo where he will and to dwell in a another contre and to
leve our childerne on taught? Does not ye Pope so? Have we not geven up our
tithes of curtesy unto one for to teach us Gods word? And comes not the Pope
and compels us to pay it violently to them that never teach? Makes he not
one Person^
person which comes never at us? ye one shall have.v. or.vj. or as many as he
can get and wotteth oftentimes where never one of them stondeth. A another is
made Uicar

a Parish pressed
parish priest which can but mynister a sort of dome ceremonies. And he
because he has most labor and leest profit polleth on his part and fetteth
here a mass penny there a trentall / yonder dirige money and for his beyderoule
with a confession penny and soch like. And thus are we never taught and are yet
nevertheless compelled: ye compolde to hyre many costly scolemasters. These
deades are verily agenst Christ. Shall we therefore judge you by your deades /
as Christ commands? So are ye false prophets and ye disciples of
Antichriste or of against Christ.

The sermons which thou readist in the Acts of ye apos^les and all yt the
apostles preached were no doubt preached in the mother tongue. Why the^ might
they not be written in the mother tongue? As if one of us preach a good sermon
why may it not be written? Saint hierom also translated the bible in to his
mother tongue. Why may not we also? They will say it can not be translated in
to our tongue it is so rude. It is not so rude as they are false liars. For the
greek tongue agrees moare with the english then with the latyne. And the The
propirties of the hebrew tongue agree with the english.
propirties of the hebrew tongue agreth a thousand times moare with the english
then with the latyne. The manner of speaking is both one so yt in a thousand
places thou neadest not but to tra^s / late it in to ye english word for word
when thou must seek a compass in the latyne / and yet shall have much work to
translate it wel-faveredly / so that it have the same grace and swetnesse /
sense and pure understanding with it in the latyne / as it has in the hebrew.
A thousand parts better may it be translated in to the english then in to
the latyne. Ye and except my memory fail me and that I have forgotten what I
read when I was a child thou shall find in the englesh cronycle how that
king King Adelston.
Adelstone caused the holy scripture to be translated into the tongue that then
was in England and how the prelates exhorted him there unto.

Contrary preachinge
Moareover saying ye one of you ever preaches contrary to a another. And when
two of you mete / the one disputes and bravleth with the other / as it were
two scoldes. And for as much as one holds this doctoure and a another that.
Contrari do^ctours
One follows duns a another saint Thomas / a another Bonaventure / alexander de
hales / raymo^de / lyre / brygo^ / dorbell / holcott / gorra^ / tru^bett / hugo
de sancto victore / de monte regio / de nova villa / de media villa and soch
like out of nu^bre. So yt if thou haddest^ but of every auctor one book thou
coudest not pyle the^ up in any ware house in london / and every auctor is one
contrary unto a another. In so great diversite of sprites how shall I know who
lies and who says troth? Whereby shall I try the^ and judge the^? Verily by
gods word which only is true. But how shall I yt do when thou will not let me
se the scripture?

Nay say they / the scripture is so hard that thou coudest never understand
it but by ye doctors. That is I must measure the mete yard by the cloth. Here
be twenty clothes of diverse lengthes and of diverse bredthes. How shall I be
sure of the length of the mete yard by them? I suppose rather I must be first
sure of the length of the mete yard / and there by measure and judge the
clothes. If I must first beleve the doctoure / then is the doctoure first true
and the truth of the scripture depends of his truth and so the truth of
God springs of ye truth of man. Thus Antichriste turnith the rotes of the
trees vppwarde. Antichrist turns the rotes of the tree upward.
What is ye cause that we damme some of Origenes works and allow some? How
know we that some is heresy and some not? By the scripture I trow. How know
we yt saint Augustine (which is the best or one of the best that ever wrote upon
the scripture) wrote many things amysse at ye beginning / as many other
doctors do? Verily by the The scripture is the trial of all doctrine and the
right twich ston
scriptures / as he him self well perceaved afterward when he looked moare
diligently apo^ them / and revoked many things again. He wrote of many
things which he understood not when he was newly converted / yer he had
thoroughly seen the scriptures / and followed the opinions of Plato and the
commune persuasions of man's wisdom yt were then famous.

Philosophy.
They will say yet moare shamefully / that no man can understand the
scriptures without philautia / that is to say philosophy. A man must first be
well seen in Aristoteles yer he can understand the scripture say they.
Aristotell
Aristoteles doctrine is / that the world was without beginning and shall be
without end / and that the first man never was and the last shall never be.
And that God does all of necessite nether cares what we do nether will ask
any accomptes of that we do. Without this doctrine how could we understand
the Scripture
scripture that says / God created the world of naught / and God works all
thing of his fre will and for a secret purpose / and that we shall all rise
again / and that God will have acomptes of all that we have done in this life.
Aristotell
Aristotle says. Geve a man a law and he has power of him self to do or
fulfill ye law and becomes righteous with workynge righteously. Paul
But Paul and all the scripture says / that the law does but utter sin
only and helps not. Nether has any man power to do the law / till the
sprite of God be geven him through faith in Christ. Is it not a madness then to
say yt we could not understood the scripture without Aristotle. Aristotell
Aristotle's righteousness and all his virtues spring of a ma^s fre will. And a
turk and every infidele and ydolater may be righteous and virtuous with that
righteousness and those virtues. Moare over Aristoteles felicite and blessedness
stondeth in avoydinge of all tribulacions / and in riches / health / honor /
worshepe / friends and autorite / which felicite pleases our spiritualty
well. Now without these and a thousand soch like points / could thou not
understand Script^^e
scripture which says yt righteousness comes by christ and not of ma^s will
and how that virtues are the fruits and the gift of gods sprite and that
Christ blesses us in tribulacions / persecucion and adversite? How / I say /
coudest thou understood the scripture without Philosophi.
Philosophy / in as much as Paul
Paul / in the second to the Collossie^s warned them to beware lest any man
should spoil them (that is to say / rob them of their faith in Christ)
through Philosophy and disceytfull vanytes / and through the tradicions of men
and ordinances after the world and not after Christ.

By this means then / thou will that no man teach a another / but that every
man take the scripture and learn by him self. Nay verily / so say I not.
When noma^ will teach. if we desire god will teach.
Never ye less / saying that ye will not teach / if any man thyrste for the
truth / and read the scripture by him self desyringe God to open ye door of
knowledge unto hi^ / God for his truethes sake will and must teach him. How be
it my meani^ge is yt as a master teaches his pre^tyse to know all ye points
of the mete yard / first how many enches / how many foot and the hal^e yard /
ye quarter and the nail / and the^ teaches hi^ to mete other things thereby:
The order of teachinge
eve^ so will I that ye teach the people Gods law / and what obedience God
requires of us unto father and mother / master / lord / ki^ge and all
superiors / and with what friendly love he commands one to love a another.
And teach the^ to know that natural vename and birth poison which moves the
very hertes of us to rebelle agenste the ordinances and will of God / and
prove that no man is righteous in the sight of God / but that we are all damned
by the law. And then (when thou have meked them and feared them with the law)
teach them the testamente and promises which God has made unto us in Christ /
and how merciful and kind he is / and how much he loves us in Christ. And
teach them the principles and the ground of the faith and what the sacraments
signifye and then shall the sprite work with thy preachinge and make them
feale. So would it come to pass / that as we know by natural wit what
follows of a true principle of natural reason: even so by the principles of
the faith and by the plain scriptures and by the text / should we judge all
men's exposicion and all men's doctrine / and should receave the best and refuse
the worst. I would have you to teach them also the propirties and manner of
speakinges of the scripture / and how to expound proverbes and similitudes.
And then if they goo abroad and walk by the feldes and meadows of all manner
doctors and philosophers they could catch no harm. They should dyscerne the
poison from the honey and bring whom no thing but that which is wholesome.

The disorder or overwar^e order of our scole men
But now do ye clean contrary. Ye dryve them from Gods word and will let no man
come there to / until he have been two years master of art. First they nosell
them in sophistry and in benefundatu^ The scole doctrine: as they ca^^ it:
corrupts the judgments o^ (...)
. And there corrupt they their judgments with apparente arguments and with
alleginge unto them textes of logycke / of natural philautia / of methaphisick
and moral philosophy and of all manner books of Aristotle and of all manner
doctors which they yet never saw. Moare over one holds this a another that.
One is a real / a another a nominall. What wonderful Dreams
dreams have they of their predicamentes / vniversales / second intencions /
quidities hecseities and relatives. And whether species fundata in chimera be
vera species. And whether this proposicio^ be true non ens est aliquid. Whether
ens be equivo cum or vnivo cu^. Ens is a voice only say some. Ens is vnivocum
says a another and descends in to ens creatum and in to ens increatum per
modos intrinsecos. when they have this wise brauled *viij x. or.xij. or moo
years and after that their judgments are utterly corrupt: then they begin
their Devinite. Scole divinity
Not at the scripture: but every man takes a sundry doctoure / which doctors
are as sundry and as dyvers / the one contrary unto the other / yet i^ this
they all agree: that noman is saved by Christ but by holy we^kes. And that
christ has geve^ up his godhed to the pope* And all his power and that the
pope may geve christ's merits to who^ he will and take them from who^ he w^ll.

Potters: ye mockers or rather iugular^


as there are diverse facions and monstrous shappes / none like a another /
among our sects of religion. Every religion / every vniversite and all most
every man has asondry dyvinite. Now what so ever opinions every man fyndeth
with his doctoure / that is his Gospel and that only is true with him and that
holds he all his life long / and every man to mayntene his doctoure with all
/ corrupts the scripture and facioneth it after his own imaginacion as a
Potter does his claye. Of what text thou provest hell / will a another prove
purgatory / a another lymbo patrum / and a another the assumpcion of our ladi:
And a another shall prove of the same text that an Ape has a tail. And of
what text the graye friar proves yt our lady was without original sin /
of the same shall the black friar prove yt she was conceyved in original
sin. And all this do they with apare^te reasons with false similitudes and
likenesses / and with arguments and persuasions of man's wisdom. False
similitudes*
Now there is no other divisio^ or heresy in the world save man's wisdom and
when man's folish wisdom intetpreteth ye scripture. Man's wisdom heresy Cotes
Man's wisdom scatereth / divides and makes sects / while the wisdom of one
is that a white Cote is best to sarve God in / and a another says a black / a
another a gray / another a blew: And while one says that God will hear your
prayer in this place / a another says in yt place: And while one says this
place is holier / Place
and a another that place is holier / and this religion is holyer then that /
and this saint is greater with God then that and an hundred thousand like
things. Man's One religion is holier then a another: Man's wisdom is ydolatry.

What God is


wisdom is plain ydolatry / nether is there any other ydolatry then to imagen
of God after man's wisdom. God is not man's imaginacion / but that only which he
says of him self. God is no thing but his law and his promyses / that is to
say / that which he bids the do and that which he bids the beleve and
hope. God is but his word: as Christ says John. viij. I am that I say unto
you / that is to say / that which I preach am I. My words are spirit and
life. God is that only which he testifies of him self and to imagen any other
thing of God then that / is damnable ydolatry. Therefore says the.cxviij ^
Psalm happy are they which sherch ye testimonies of the lord / that is to
say / that which God testifies and witteneseth unto us. But how shall I that
do when ye will not let me have his testimonies or wittenesses in a tongue
which I understand? Will ye resist god Will ye forbid him to geve his
spirit unto the lay as well as unto you? Has he not made the english tongue?
Why forbid ye him to speak in the enhlish tongue then / as well as in the
latyne?

Finally that this thretenynge and forbiddynge the lay people to read the
scripture is not for love of your souls (which they care for as ye fox does
for ye gysse) is evide^te and clerer the^ the son / in as much as they
permit and sofre you to read Read what thou will: ye and say what thou
wylt save the truth
Robynhode and bevise of ha^pto^ / hercules / hector and troylus with a
tousande histories and fables of love and wa^tones and of rybaudry as fylthy as
heart ca^ think / to corrupt ye minds of youth with all / clean contrary to
the doctrine of christ and of his apostles. For Paul (Ephesians. v.) says: se
that fornicacion and all uncleanness or covetousnes be not once named among you /
as it becomes saints: nether fylthines / nether folysh talking / nor
gestinge which are not comely. For this ye know that no whoremonger other
unclean person or covetous person (which is the worsheper of images) has any
enheritaunce in the kingdom of Christ and of God. And after / says he /
through soch things comes the wrath of God upon the childerne of unbelief. Now
saying they permit you freely to read those things which corrupt your
mi^des and rob you of ye kingdom of god and christ and bring ye wrath of
god apo^ you how is this forbyddi^ge for love of your souls?

A thousand reasons moo might be made (as thou may sein paraclesis Erasmi
and in his preface to yt paraphasis of Matthew) unto which they should be
compelled to hold their peace or to geve shamfull answares. But I hope that
these are sufficient unto them that thirst the truth. God for his mercy and
troth shall well open the^ moo: ye and other secrets of his Godly wisdom /
if they be diligent to cry unto him / which grace grant God. AMEN.

The Prologe unto the book.
FOr as much as our holy prelates and our gostly religious / which ought to
defend Gods word / speak evyll of it and do all ye shame they can to it /
and rail on it and bear their captives in hand yt it causes insurrection and
teaches the people to disobeye their heedes and governers / and moves them to
rise agenst their princes and to make all comen and to make havoke of other
men's goods. Therefore have I made this little treatise that folweth contayninge
all The obedience of monks and freres is not here. For they are not of God But
of there own fanynge
obedience that is of God In which (who so ever reads it) shall easily
perceave / not ye contrary only and that they lie: but also the very cause of
soch blasphemy and what stereth them so furiously to rage and to belie the
truth.

How be it / it is no new thing unto the word of god to be rayled upon /
nether is this the first time that ypocrites have ascribed to Gods word the
vengeance where of they themselves were ever cause. The ypocrites lay that to
gods word which they the^ selves are cause of God warns yer he strike.
For the ypocrites with their false doctrine and ydolatry have evermoare lade
the wrath and vengeance of God upon the People / so sore that God could no
longer forbere nor differ his puneshmente. Yet God / which is all ways
merciful / before he would take vengeance / has ^ver sent his true prophets
and true preachers / to warn the people that they might repent. But the
people for the most part and namely the heedes and rulers through comfort and
persuadinge of the ypocrites / have ever waxed moare hard herted then before /
and have persecuted the word of God and his prophets. Then God which is also
righteous / has always poured his plages upon them with out delay. When God
punishes the ydolatry of the ypocrites: the^ say they: that new learning is
cause the^e of
Which plages the ypocrites ascribe unto Gods word saying: se what mischeve
is come upon us sens this new learning come up and this new sect and this new
doctrine. This seist thou Hieremias.xliiij. Where the people cried to goo to
their old ydolatry again saying: sens we left it / we have bynne in all
necessite and have bynne consumed with war and hongre. But the prophet
answered them / yt their ydolatry went unto the heart of God / so that he
could no longer sofre the maliciousnes of their own imaginacions or
inve^cions / and that the cause of all soch myscheves was / because they would
not hear tho voice of the lord and walk in his law / ordinances and
testimonies. Christ was accused of insurreccion.
The scribes and the pharisees laid also to Christ's charge (Luke. xxiij.) that
he moved the people to sedicion. And said to Pilate / we have found this
fellow pervertinge the people and for biddinge to pay tribute to Caesar / and
says that he is Christ a king. And again in the same chapter / he moves ye
people (said they) teachinge through out all jury and began at Galile eve^ to
this place. So like wise laid they to the Apostles charge / as thou may se in
the Acts. Saint Cypriane also and saint Augustine and many other more made
works in defense of the word of God against soch blasphemies: So that thou
may se / how that it is no new thing / but an old and acustomed thing with
the ypocrites to wite Gods word and the true preachers of all the mischeve
which their lyinge doctrine is the very cause of? Why troubyll follows the
preaching of the Gospel


Never ye later in very deed / after the preachinge of Gods word / because it
is not truly received. God sends great troble in to the world: partly to
avenge him self of the tyrauntes and persecuters of his word and partly to
destroy those worldly people which make of Gods word no thing but a clo^e of
their fleshly liberty. They are not all good that follow the Gospel. Christ
(Matthei. in the.xiij. chapter.) likeneth the kingdom of heve^ unto a net
cas^ in ye see yt ketcheth fishes both good and bad. The kingdom of heve^ is
the preachinge of ye Gospel / unto which come both good and bad But ye good are
few. Christis floc a little flock
Christ calls the^ therefore a little flock Luke. xij. For they are ever few
that come to the Gospel of a true entente sekinge therein nothing but the
glory and praise of God and offeringe them selves freely and willingly to take
adversite with Christ for the Gospels sake and for beringe report unto the
truth / that all men may hear it. The greatist nombre come and ever came and
followed even Christ him self for a worldly purpose. As thou may well se
(John. vj.) how that almost fyve thousand followed Christ and would also have
made him a king / because he had well fed them. Whom he rebuked saying: ye
seek me not / because ye saw the miracles: But because ye ate of the bred and
were filled / and drove them away from him with hard preachinge.

Even so now (as ever) the most part seek Liberty.
liberty. They be glad when they here the insatiable covetousnes of the
spiritualte rebuked: When they hear their falsheed and wiles uttered: When
tyranny and oppression is preached agenst: When the hear how kings and all
Officers should rule christenly and brotherly and seek no other thing save the
wealth of their subjects: and when they hear that they have no soch auctorite
of God so to pylle and polle as they do and to reyse up taxes and gaderinges
to mayntene their fantasies and to make war they wot not for what cause. God
destroys one weked with a another.

Gods word is not the cause of evell.


And therefore because the heedes will not so rule / will they also no longer
obey / but resist and rise age^ste their evyll heedes And one weked
destroys a another. Yet is Gods word not the cause of this nether yet the
preachers. For though that Christ him self taught all obedience / how that it
is not lawful to resist wrong (but for the officer that is appointed there
unto) and how a man must love his very enemy and pray for the^ that persecute
him and bless them that curse him / and how that all vengeance must be
remitted to God / and that a man must forgeve / if he will be forgeven of God.
Yet the people for the most part received it not They were ever ready to rise
and to fight. For ever when the scribes and phareses went about to take Christ
they were afraid of the people. Not on the holy day (said they Math. xxvi).
lest any rumoure arise among the people. And Matthew. xxi. They would have take
him / but they feared the people. And Luke. xx. Christ asked the Phareses a
question unto which they durst not answer / lest the people should have stoned
them Christ's disciples were long weak and worldly minded


Last of all for as much as the very disciples and Apostles of Christ after so
long hearing of Christ's doctrine were yet ready to fight for Christ clean
against Christ's teachi^ge. As Peter (Math. xxvi.) drew his sword but was
rebuked. And Luke. ix. James and John would have had fire to come from heven to
consume the samaritanes and to ave^ge ye injury of Christ: but were like wise
rebuked / if christ's disciples were so long carnal what wonder is it / if we
be not all perfect ye first day? The popis doctrine causes: ye commands
murt^er
Ye in as much as we be taught even of very babes / to kill a turk / to slay a
Jew / to burn an heritike / to fight for ye liberties and right of ye church
as they call it: ye and in as much as we are brought in belefe if we shede the
blood of our even christen or if the son shede ye blood of his father that
begat him / for the defense / not of the popes god heed only / but also for
what so ever cause it be / ye though it be for no cause but that his holiness
commands it only / that we deserve as much as Christ deserved for us when he
died on the cross: or if we be slain in the quarrel that our souls goo / nay
fly to heven / and be there yer our blood be cold. In as much (I say) as
we have sucked in soch bloody imaginacions in to the botome of our hertes even
with our mothers milk / and have be so long hardened therein / what wonder
were it / if while we be yet young in Christ / we thought that it were lawful
to fight for the true word of God? Ye and though a man were throwly persuaded
yt it were not lawful to resist his king / though he would wrongfully take
away life and goods: Yet might he think that it were lawful to resist the
ypocrites and to rise / not against his king: but with his king to delyver his
king out of bondage and captivite / wherein ye ypocrites hold him with wyles
and falsheed / so that no man may be sofered to come at him / to tell him the
troth.

This seist thou / that it is the bloody doctrine of the Pope which causes
disobedience / rebelion and insurreccion. The popes doctrine is bloody
For he teaches to fight and to defend his traditions and what so ever he
dreameth with fire / water and sword and to disobeye father / mother / master
/ lord / king and Emperor: Ye and to invade what so ever lord or nacio^ yt
will not receave and admit his godheed. Christ's doctrine is peaceable
Where ye peaceable doctrine of Christ teaches to obey and to sofre for ye
word of god and to remit ye ve^geau^ce and the defense of ye word to God
which is mighty and able to defend it / which also as soon as ye word is once
openly preached and testified or wittenesed unto ye world / God ave^geth his
doctrine him self
and when he has geve^ them a season to repe^te / is ready at once to take
ve^geaunce of his enemies and shoteth arowes with heedes dipte in deadly poyso^
at the^ and pours his plages from heve^ down apo^ them and se^deth the more^
and pestilence among them / and sinketh ye cities of them and makes ye earth
swalow them / and compaseth them in their wiles and takes them in their own
trappes and snares / and casts them in to the pittes which they dug for
other men / and sends them a dasynge in the heed and utterly destroys them
with their own sotle cowncell. How a man ought to behave him self in
reading of doctors and also in the scripture:
Prepare thy mind therefore unto this little treatise and read it discretly and
judge it indifferently / and when I allege any scripture / look thou on the
text / whether I enterpret it right which thou shall easyly perceave / by the
circunstance and process of them / if thou make Christ the foundacio^ and
ground and byld all on him and referrest all to him / and find also that the

And God the father of mercy which for his trouthes sake raised our savioure
Christ up again to justify us / geve ye his spirit to judge what is
righteous in his eyes and geve the strength to abide by it and to mayntene it
with all patience and long soferinge / unto ye ensample and edifienge of his
congregation and glory of his name. AMEN.

The obedience of all degrees proved by Gods word and first of childern unto
there elders.
GOd (which works all in all things) for a secret judgment and purpose and
for his godly pleasure / provided an hour that thy father and mother should
come to gether / to make the through them. He was present with them thy mothers
womb and facioned the and brethed life in to the / and for the great love he
had unto the / provided milk in thy mothers breasts for the against thou were
borne: moved also thy father and mother and all other to love the / to pity
the and to care for the.

And as he made ye through the^ / so has he cast ye under the power and
auctorite of the^ / to obey and serve the^ Our fathers and mothers are to us
in Gods stead.
in his stead saye^ge: honor thy father and mother. Exodi. xx. Which is not to
be understand in bowinge the kne and puttinge of the cappe only / but yt thou
love the^ with all thine heart and fear and dread them and wait on their
commandments and seek their worsheppe / pleasure will and profit in all
things / and geve thy life for them countinge the^ worthy of all honor /
reme^bringe that thou art their good and possession / an^ that thou owe unto
the^ thine own self and all that thou art able / ye and moare then thou art
able to do.

what we do to our fathe^^ and mothers that we do to God.
Understand also that what soever thou do unto them (be it good or badde)
thou do unto God. When thou please them thou please God: when thou
displeasest the^ thou displeasest God: when they are anger with the / God is
anger with ye / nether is it possible for the to come unto the favor of God
again (no though all ye Angels of heve^ pray for ye) until thou have
submitted thy self unto thy father and mother again.

If thou obey (though it be but carnally (either for fear / for vain glory
or profit) thy blessinge shall be long life upon the earth. The reward of
obedience
For he says / honor thy father and mother / yt thou may live long upon
the earth. Exodi. xx. The reward of disobedience.
Contrary wise if thou disobeye them / thy life shall be shortened upon the earth.
For it follows. Exodi. xxj. He yt smyteth his father or mother shall be put to
deeth for it. And he that curses (that is to say / rayleth or dishonors
his father or mother with opprobrious words) shall be slain for it. And
Deuteronomion. xxj. If any man have a son stoburne and disobedient which
hereth not ye voice of his father and the voice of his mother / so yt they have
taught hi^ nurtoure and he regards the^ not / the^ let his father and mother
take hi^ and bring hi^ forth unto the seniours or elders of y^ cite and unto
ye gate of ye same place. And let the^ say unto ye seniours of yt cite: this
our son is stoburne and disobedient. He will not hear unto our voice: he
is a rioter and a dro^kerd. The^ let all the me^ of yt cite stone hi^ with
stones unto deeth so shall ye put away wekednesse from among you and all
Israel shall hear and shall fear.

And though yt ye te^porall officers (to their own da^nacio^) be negligent in
punishinge soch disobedience (as the spiritual officers are to teach it) and
wi^ke at it or look on it through the fingers: yet shall they not escape
unpunished. God ave^geth disobedience him self though the officer will not.
For ye ve^geau^ce of God shall acco^panie the^ (as thou may se deuteronomion
xxviij) With all misfortune and evil luck / and shall not depart from them
until they be murdered / drounde or ha^gaed / either until by one mischaunce or
a another they be utterly brought to naught. Ye and the world often times
hangs many a man for yt they never deserved / but God ha^geth the^ because
they would not obey and harken unto their elders: as ye consciences of many
well find when they come unto ye galowes. There ca^ they preach and teach
other / yt which they the^ selves would not learn in season.

The marriage also of the childern perteyneth unto their elders / Marriage*
as thou may se j. Corinthioru^. vij. and through out all the scripture / by
the auctorite of the said commandment / child obey father and mother. Which
thing ye hethe^ and ge^tyls have ^^er kept and to this day keep / unto the
great shame and rebuke of us christen: in as much as the weddinges of our
virgyns (shame it is to speak it) ar moare like unto the saute of a Covetosnes
makes our spiritualte that they cannot se that which a turk is asshamed of
bitche / then the marienge of a reasonable creature. Se not we daily.iij. or
iiij. calengynge one woman before the Co^missary or officeall / of which not
one has the consent of her father and mother. And yet he yt has most money /
has best right and shall have her in the dispite of all her friends and in
diffiau^ce of Gods ordinances.

Moare over when she is geve^ b^ ye judge unto the one patie and also married
even then oftymes shall the contrary part sue before an hier judge or an
other yt succeadeth the same and for money devorce her again So shamfully
does ye covetousnes and ambicion of our prelates mock with ye laws of God.
I pass over with silence how many years they will prolonge the sentence with
cavillacions and suttelte / if they be well monyed on both parties / and if a
da^sell promise.ij. how sha^full counsel they will geve ye Get her with
child: say they. so shall thy cause be best.
second and also how the religious of satan do separate inseparable
matrimony For after thou art lawfully married at the co^maundeme^te of father
and mother and with the consent of all thy fre^des: Gods commandments break
they through their own traditions
yet if thou will be disgysed like unto one of the^ and swear obedience unto
their traditions / thou may disobeye father and mother / break ye oath which
thou have sworn to God before his holy congregation and with draw love and
charity ye hiest of Gods co^mau^dme^tes and yt duty and service which thou
owe unto thy wife: where of Christ ca^ not dispe^ce with ye. For Christ is
not against god / but with god and came not to break gods ordinances / but to
fulfill the^. That is he came to overcome y^ with ki^dnes and to make y^ to do
of very love y^ thing which the law co^pelleth y^ to do. For love only and to
do service unto thy neyboure is ye fulfillinge of ye law in ye sight of god. To
be a monk or a friar / thou may thus forsake thy wife before thou have ly^e
with her / but not to be a seculer pressed. Money makes marchaundice
And yet after thou art professed / the Pope for money will dispe^ce with the /
both for thy cote and all thy obedience / and make a seculer pressed of ye: like
wise as it is simonye to sell a benefice (as they call it) but to resign upon
a pe^cion and the^ to redeem the same / is no simony at all. Oh crastie
iugelers and mockers with the word of God. Iugulars


The obedienie of wives unto their husbands.
AFter yt Eve was deceaved of ye serpent / God said unto her Genesis. iij. Thy
lust or appetite shall pertayne unto thy husband and he shall rule the or
raygne over the. God which created the woman knows what is in that weak
vessel (as Peter calls her) and has therefore put her under the obedience of
her husband to rule her lusts and wanta^ appetites. Peter. j. Pet. iij.
exhorts wives to be in subieccio^ unto their husbands / after the ensample
of the holy weme^ which in old time trusted in God / and as Sara obeyed Abraham
and called him lord. Which Sara before she was married / was Abraha^s sister
and equal with him: but as soon as she was Marriage alters the degree of nature
married was in subieccio^ and became without comparison inferior. For so is ye
nature of wedlock by the ordinance of God It were much better that our wives
folowid ye e^sample of the holy weme^ of old time in obeye^ge their husbands /
the^ to worship the^ with a Pater noster / an A^e and a Credo / or to stick
up candels before their images. Paul Ephe. v. says: women submit your selves
unto your own husbands / as unto ye lord. For the husband is the wives heed
eve^ as Christ is the heed of the co^gregacio^. Therefore as the co^gregacio^ is
in subieccio^ to christ / like wise let wives be in subieccio^ unto their
husbands in all things. Let ye woman therefore fear her husband / as Paul
says in ye said place. For her husband is unto her in ye sted of god / y^ she
obey hi^ and wait o^ his co^mau^dme^tes. And his co^mau^dme^tes are gods
commaundmentes. The husband is to the wife i^ Gods sted
If she therefore grudge against him or resist him she grudgeth agenste God and
resists God.

The obedience of Servauntes unto their Masters.
SErvauntes obey your carnal masters with fear and tre^blinge in si^glenesse
of your hertes as unto Christ: not with service in ye eye sight as me^
pleasers: but as ye servau^tes of christ doing ye will of god from the heart
with good will / eve^ as though ye served the lord and not me^. Ephe. vj. And
j. Pe. ij. servau^tes obey your masters with all fear not only if they be
good and courteous: but also though they be froward. For it comes of grace /
if a man for conscience toward God endure gr^ffe sofferi^ge wrongfully. For
what praise is it if when ye be buffeted for your fautes / ye take it
pacie^tly? But and if when ye do well / ye s^ffer wrong and take it pacie^tly
/ than is there thank with God. Here unto verily were ye called. For Christ
also sofferd for our sakes levynge us an example to follow his steps. In what
so ever kind therefore thou art a servant / duringe the time of thy
covenauntes / thy master is unto the in ye stead and rowme of God and god
through hi^ fedeth the / The master is unto the servaunt i^ gods sted.
clotheth the / rules and lerneth the his commandments are Gods
co^maundmentes and thou ought to obey him as God / and in all things to
seek his pleasure and profit. For thou art his good and possession / as his ox
or his horse in so much that who so ever does but desire the in his heart from
him without his love and license is condemned of God / which says Exodi. xx.
se thou once covet not thy neybours servavntes.

Our spiritualte reteyne men's sarvauntes not to honor God but there
traditions and ceremomonies only.
Paul ye Apostle sent home Onesimus unto his master (as thou read in the
pistle of Paul to Philemo^) In so much yt though the said Philemon with his
servaunte also was converted by Paul and owed unto Paul and to the word that
Paul preached / not his servaunte only / but also him self: ye and though
that Paul was in necessite and lacked ministers to minister unto him in the
bo^des which he soffered for the Gospels sake: yet would he not retain the
servaunt necessary unto ye furtheraunce of the Gospel without the consent of
the master.

Christ's doctrine and the popes differ:
O how sore differs ye doctrine of christ and his Apostles from the doctrine
of the Pope and of his Apostles. For if any man will obey nether father ner
mother / If thy master please the not shave the self a monk a friar or a
pressed.
nether lord nor master / nether king ner prince / ye same needs but only to
take the mark of the beast / that is / to shave him self a monk / a friar or
a pressed / and is then immediately fre and exempted fro all service and obedience
due unto man. To obey no man is a spiritual thing.
He that will obey no man (as they will not) is most acceptable unto them. The
moare disobedient that thou art unto Gods ordinances / the moare apt and
mete art thou for theirs. Nether is the professinge / vowinge and sweringe
obedience unto their ordinances any other thing / then the defienge /
denienge and forsweringe obedience unto ye ordinances of God.

The obedience of Subjects unto kings princes and rulers. The.xiij. Chapter
of Paul Romans
LEt every soul submit hi^ ^ylfe unto the auctorite off the hyer powers. There
is no power but of God. The powers yt bear ordained off God. Whosoever
therefore resysteth ye power resysteth ye ordinance of God. They yt resist /
shall recea to the^ silfe da^nacio^. For ruelars are not to be feared for good
works but for evyll. Will thou be without fear of ye power? Do well the^ and
so shall thou be praised off the same. For he is ye minister off god / for thy
wealth. But and yff thou do evyll / then fear. for he bears not a swearde for
naught. For he is the minister off God / to take vengeance on the^ that do
evil. Wherefore ye must needs obey not for fear off ve^geaunce only: but also
because of conscience. Eve^ for this cause pay ye tribute. For they are gods
ministers / servynge for the same purpose.

Geve to every man therefore his duty: Tribute to whom tribute belongs:
Custom to whom custom is due: fear to who^ fear belongs: honor to who^
honor pertayneth. Owe nothing to any man: but to love one a another. For he
that loves another / fulfilleth the law. For these commandments: Thou
shall not commit advoutry: Thou shall not kill: Thou shall not steal: Thou
shall not bear falce witness: Thou shall not desire: and so forth if there be
any other commandment / are all co^prehe^ded in this saying: Love thine
neghbour as thy silfe. Love hurts not his neghbour: therefore is love the
fulfillynge off the law.

AS a father over his childern is both lord and judge forbiddinge yt one
brorher avenge him self on a another / but (if any cause of strife be between
the^) will have it brought unto hi^ self or his assigns / to be judged and
correct: so God forbids all me^ to ave^ge the^ selves / and takes ye
auctorite and office of ave^gi^ge unto hi^ self saying: ve^geau^ce is mine
and I will reward: deuter. xxxij. which text Paul alegeth To. xij. For it is
impossible yt a man should be a righteous an egall or an indiffere^te judge in
his own cause / lusts and appetites so bli^de us. Moare over when thou
ave^gest thy self / thou make not peace / but sterest up moare debate.

God therefore has geve^ laws unto all nations and in all lo^des has put
kings / governers and rulers in his own stead / to rule the world through
the^. And has commanded all causes to be brought before the^ / as thou
read Exo. xxij. In all causes (says he) of injury or wrong / whether it be
ox / ass / sheep or vesture / or any lost thing which an other calengeth /
let ye cause of both parties be brought unto ye Gods who^ ye Gods co^de^ne the
same shall pay dowble unto his neiboure. Judges are called Gods.
Mark / ye judges are called Gods in the scriptures because they are in Gods
rowme and execute ye co^mau^dme^tes of God. And in an other place of ye said
chapter Moses charge saye^ge: se yt thou rail not on the Gods nether speak
evil of ye ruler of thy people. Who so ever therefore resists the^ resists
God (for they are in ye rowme of god) and they yt resist shall receave their
da^nacio^.

Soch obedience unto father and mother / master / husband / emperor / ki^ge
/ lords and rulers requires God of all nations / ye of ye very turks and
infideles. Blessing
The blessinge and reward of the^ that keep the^ / is ye life of this world
as thou read Leuiticu^. xviij. keep my ordinances and laws / which if a
man keep he shall lyve therein. Which text Paul reherseth Roma. x. provinge
thereby that the righteousness of the law is but wordly / and the reward thereof
is ye life of this world. Curse
And the curse of the^ that breaks them / is the loss of this life: as thou
seist by the punishment appointed for them.

And whosoever keeps the law (whether it be for fear / for vain glory or
profit) though no man reward him / yet shall God God rewards all obedience:
though noman else do.
bless him abunda^tly and send him wordly prosperity / as thou read
Deuteronomion. xxviij. What good blessings accompanye ye kepinge of the law /
and as we se the turks far exceade us christen men in worldly prosperity for
their just kepinge of their temporal laws. Like wise though no man punish
the breakers of the law / yet shall God send his curses upon them till they
be vterly brought to naught as thou read most terrebly even in the said
place. God ave^geth all disobedience though no man else do.


Nether may ye inferior person ave^ge him self apo^ ye superior or violently
resist him for what so ever wrong it be. If he do he is condemned in the
deed doing: in as much as he takes upon hi^ yt which belo^heth to god only
which says ve^geau^ee is mine and I will reward Deute. xxxij. Uengeaunce is
Gods
And christ says Math xxvi. all they yt take ye sword shall perish with ye
sword. Take thou a sword to avenge thy self* so gevest thou not room unto
god to ave^ge the but robbest him of his most hi^ honor / in that thou will
not let him be judge over the.

If any man might have ave^ged him self upon his superior / David
that might David most righteously have done upon king Saul which so
wrongfully persecuted David / eve^ for no other cause / the^ y^ God had
anoi^ted him king and promised hi^ ye kingdom. Yet when god had delyverd Saul
in to ye hands of David / yt he might have done what he would with hi^ as thou
seist in ye first book of kings ye.xxiiij. chapter / how Saul came in to the
cave where David was. And David came to him secretly and cut of a piece of his
garment. And as soon as he had done it his hertsmote hi^ because he had done so
much unto his lord. And when his me^ corraged him to ^le hi^ he a^swered / the
lord forbid it me / yt I should lay mine hond on hi^. Nether soffered he his
me^ to hurt him / When Saul was gone out David followed and showed hi^ the piece
of his garme^te and said: why belevist thou the words of me^ yt say / David
goes about to do the harm? perceave and se that there is nether evell ner
wickedness in my hand and that I have not trespased against the / and yet
thou layest awayte for my life. God judge between the and me and avenge me of
ye / but mine hand be not apo^ ye as / the old proverb says (said david)
God destroys one weked by a another.
out of the weked shall wekednesse proceed / but mine hand be not apo^ the
meani^ge that God ever punishes one weked by an other. And again (said David)
God be judge / and judge between the and me and behold and plete my cause / and
geve me iudgeme^te or right of the.

And in the.xxvi. Chapter of the same book / when Saul persecuted David again.
David came to Saul by night / as he slepte and all his men / and took away his
spear and a coppe of water from his hedde. Then said Abisai David's servaunte /
God has delyvered the thine enemy in to thine hand this day / let me now
therefore nail hi^ to the ground with my spear and geve him but even one
stripe and no moare. David forbad him sainge. God provideth a means to take
the evell out of the waeye when they have fulfilled there wekednes
kill him not. For who (said he) shall lay hands on the lords a^noynted and
be not gyltye? The lord lives or by the lords life (said he) he dies not
except the lord smite him or that his day be come to dye or else goo to
battle and there perish.

Why did not David sle Saul / saying he was so weked / not in persecuti^ge
david only / but in disobeyenge Gods co^mau^dme^tes and in yt he had slain.
Why David slew not Saul.
lxxxv. of Gods prestes wrongfully? Verily for it was not lawful. For if he
had done it / he must have sinned agenste god. The king is in the rowme of god
in this world.
For God has made the ki^ge in every realm judge over all / and over him is
there no judge. He yt judges the king judges God and he that lays hands
on the ki^ge lays hand on God / and he that resists the king resists
God and da^neth Gods law and ordinance. If the subjects sin they must be
brought to ye kings iudgeme^te. If the king sin he must be reserved unto
the judgment / wrath and ve^geau^ce of God. The king must be reserved unto
the vengeance of God.
And as it is to resist the king / so is it to resist his officer which is
set or sent to execute the kings co^maundme^t.

And in the first Chaptour of the second book of kings David commanded the
young man to be slain / which brought unto him the croune and bracelet of
Saul and said to please David with all / that he him self had slain Saul. And
in the fourth chapter of the same book david commanded those.ij. to be slain
which brought unto him the head of Isboseth Saul's son / by whose means yet ye
hole kingdom returned unto David accordi^ge unto the promise of God.

And Luke / xiij. When they showed Christ of the Galileans / whose blood
Pilate mi^gled with their awn sacrifice: he a^swered suppose ye that these
Galilea^s were sinners above all other galilea^s / because they sofred soch
punishme^te? I tell you nay: but except ye repent ye shall like wise peresh.
Thus was told Christ / no doubt / of soch an intent as they axed him Math.
xxij. Whether it were lawful to geve tribute unto Caesar. For they thought
that it was no sin to resist an hethen prince: It is not lawful for^
christen subject to resist his prince though he be an hethen man.
as few of us would think (if we were under the turk) that it were sin to
rise agenste him / and to ryd our selves from under his dominion / so sore
have our Bisshopes robbed us of the true doctrine of Christ. But Christ
condemned their deeds and also the secret thoughts of all other that consented
there unto saying: except ye repe^te ye shall like wise perish. As who should
say / I know that ye are within in your hertes soch as they were outward in
their deades / and are under the same damnacion: except therefore ye repent
betymes / ye shall break out at the last in to like deades / and like wise
perish / as it came afterward to pass.

Here by seist thou yt ye king is in this world without law and may at his
lust do right or wrong and shall geve a comptes / but to God only.

A another conclusion is this / that no person nether any degree may be exempte
from this ordinance of God. Nether ca^ the profession of monks and freres or
any thing that the Pope or Bisshoppes ca^ lay for the^ selves / except them
from the sword of the Emperor or kings / if they break the laws. For it
is written / let every soul submit him self unto the auctorite of the hier
powers. Here is no man except / but all souls must obey. The hier powers are
the te^porall kings and princes unto whom God has geve^ the sword to puneshe
who so ever sins. The king has no power but to his da^nacion to prev^leage
the spiritualty to sin unpunished
God has not geven the^ swerdes to puneshe one and to let a another goo fre and
to sin vnpunesshed. Moare over with what face durst the spiritualte / which
ought to be the light and an example of good lyvinge unto all other / desire to
sin vnpunesshed or to be excepted from tribute / toll or custom / that they
would not bear pain with there brethern / unto the mayntenaunce of kings and
officers ordined of god to puneshe sin?

There is no powere but of God (by power understood the auctorite of kings
and princes) The powers that be / are ordened of God. Whosoever therefore
resists power resists God: Ye though he be Pope / Bisshope / monk or
friar. They that resist shall receave unto them selves damnacion. Why? For
Gods word is against them which will have all men under the power of the
temperall sword.

For rulers are not to be feared for good works but for evyll. Hereby seist
thou yt they yt resist ye powers or seek to be exe^pte from their auctorite
have evyll co^scie^ces and seek liberty to sin vnpunesshed and to be fre
from beari^ge pain with there brethren.

Will thou be without fear of the power? So do well and thou shall have laud
of the same (that is to say of the ruler) With good livynge ought the
spirituallte to rid the^ selves from fear of the temporal sword / and not
with craft and with blindinge the kings and bringinge the vengeance of God
upon the^ and in purchasinge license to sin unpunished.

For he is the minister of God for thy wealth: to defend the from a thousand
inconvenientes / from theves / murderers and them that would defile thy wife /
thy daughter and take from the all that thou have: A king is a great benefit
though he be never so evell.
ye life and all / if thou did resist.

Forthermoare though he be the greatist tyrau^te in the world / yet is he unto
ye a great benefit of God and a thing where fore thou ought to thank God
hyly. For it is better to have somewhat than to be clean stripte out of all
togeder: it is better to pay the tenthe than to loose all: it is better to
suffer one tyraunte the^ mani and to sofre wrong of one the^ of every man. Ye
and it is better to have a tyraunte unto thy ki^ge the^ a shadow / a passive
ki^ge yt does naught himself / but sofre other to do with hi^ what they will
/ and to lead hi^ whither they list. For a tyraunte though he do wrong unto
the good / yet he punessheth the evil and makes all me^ obey nether sofereth
any man to polle but him self only. A king that is soft as sylke and
effeminate / that is to say turned unto the nature of a woman / what with his
own lusts / which are as ye lo^ginge of a woman with child / so yt he ca^
not resist the^ / and what with ye wyly tyra^nye of the^ yt ever rule hi^ /
shall be much moare grevous unto ye realm the^ a right tyraunte. Read ye
chronicles and thou shall find it ever so. Princes are ordyned to punish evell
doers.


But and if thou do evyll / then fear. For he bears not a sword for
naught. For he is the minister of God / to take vengeance on them that do
evyll. Yff the office of princes geven them of God be to take ve^geaunce of
evil doers: tha^ by this text and Gods word / are all princes The da^nacio^

GOd requires the law to be kept of all men let them keep it for what soever
purpose they will. Will they not keep ye law: Three natures.
so vouchsafes he not that they enjoy this temperall life. Now are there.
three natures of men / one all to gether beestly which / in no wise receave the
law in their hertes / but rise agenst princes and rulers when so ever they are
able to make their party good. These are signified by the^ that worsheped the
golden calfe. For Moses brake the tables of the law yer he came at them.

The second are not so beestly / but receave the law / and unto the^ the law
comes: but they look not Moses in ye face. For his cou^tenau^ce is to bright
for the^ / that is / they understand not yt the law is spiritual and
requires the heart. They look on the pleasure / profit and promocion that
follows the kepinge of the law / and in respect of the reward keep they the
law outwardly with works / but not in the heart. For if they might obtain
like honor / glory / promocio^ and dignite and also avoyde all
inco^venientes / if they broke the law / so would they also break the law
and follow their lusts.

The thread are spiritual and look Moses in the open face and are (as Paul
says the second to the Romans) a law unto them selves and have the law
written in their hertes by the spirit of God. These neade nether of king ner
officers to drive the^ / nether that any man profer the^ any reward for to
keep the law. For they do it naturally.

The first work for fear of the sword only. The second for reward. The
thread work for love freely. They look on the excedi^ge mercy / love and kinds
which God has showed them in Christ and therefore love again and work freely.
Heven they take of the fre gift of God through Christ's deservi^ges / and hope
without all manner doutinge that God according to his promise / Heven comes by
christ
will in this world also defend them and do all thing for the^ of his
goodness and for Christ's sake and not for any goodness that is in them. They
co^sente unto the law that it is holy and just and that all men ought to do
what soever God commands for no other cause / A christian man seeks no moare
but gods will
but because God commands it. And their great sorrow is / because that there
is no strength in their members to do that which their heart lusts to do and
is a thurst to do.

These of the last sworte keep ye law of their own accord and that in the
heart / and have professed perpetual war against the lusts and appetites
of the flesh / till they be utterly subdued: yet not through their own
strength / but knowing and knowlegynge their wekenes cry ever for strength to
God which has promised assistence unto all that call upon him. These follow God
and are led of his sprite. The other two are led of lusts and appetites.

Lusts and appetites are diverse and many and that in one man: Lusts
ye and one lust contrary to a another and the greatest lust carries a man all
to gether away with him. We are also changed from one lust unto a another
Otherwise are we desposed when we are childern / otherwise when we are youngme^
and other wise when we are old / otherwise over eve^ and other wise in the
morninge: ye somtymes altered.vj. times in an hour. How fortuneth all this?
Frewill.
Because yt the will of man follows the wit and is subject unto the wit
and as the wit erreth so doith the will / and as the wit is in captivite /
so is the will / nether is it possible that ye will should be fre where the
wit is in bondage.

That thou may perceave and feale the thing in thine heart and not be a
vain sophister disputinge about words with out perceavinge / mark this. The
rote of al evil the greatest damnacio^ and most terrible wrath and vengeance
of God that we are in / is natural blindness. We are all out of the right way
/ every man his ways: One judges this best / a another that to be best. Now is
Worldly wit.
worldly wit no thing else but craft and sotilte to obtain that which we
judge falsely to be best. As I err in my wit / so err I in my will. The will
is bond and led.
When I judge that to be evyll / which in deed is good / then hate I that which
is good. And when I suppose that good which is evil in deed / then love I
evil. As if I be persuaded and borne in hand that my most friend is mine
enemy then hate I my best friend: and if I be brought in belefe that my most
enemy is my friend / Then love I my most enemy Now when we say / every man
has his fre will / to do what him lusts I say verily that men do what
they lust. Not with stondynge to follow lusts is not fre^dome / but captivite
and bondage. If God open any man's wits to make him feale in his heart / that
lusts and appetites are damnable / and geve hi^ power to hate and resist them
/ then is he fre even with the fredome where with Christ makes fre / and has
power to do the will of God. Fredome.


Thou may hereby perceave that all that is done in the world (before the
spirit of God come and geveth us light) is damnable sin / and the moare
glorious the moare damnable: All is sin that spre^geth not of the spirit of
god and all that is not done in the light of gods word.
so that that which ye world counts most glorious is moare damnable in the
sight of God / then that which the whore / the thief and the mortherer do.
With blind reasons of worldly wisdom may thou change the minds of youth
and make them geve them selves to what thou will either for fear / for praise
or for profit: So do our spiritualte in all there works.
and yet doist but change them from one vice to a another. As the persuasions
of her friends made lucrece chaste. Lucrece beleved if she were a good huswife
and chaste / that she should be most glorious / and that all the world would
geve her honor / and praise her. She sought her own glory in her chastity
and not Gods. When she had lost her chastity / then counted she her self most
abominable in the sight of all men / and for very pain and thought which she
had / not that she had displeased god / but that she had lost her honor /
slew her self. Look how great her pain and sorrow was for the loss of her
chastity / so great was her glory and reioysinge there in / and so much
despiced she them that were other wise / and pitied them not. Which pride god
moare abhors the^ the whordome of any whore. Of like pride are all the
moral virtues of Aristotell / Plato and Socrates / and all ye doctrine of the
philosophers the very Gods of our scole men.

In like manner is it for the most part of our most holy religion. For they of
like imaginacion do things which they of Bedle^ may se / that they are but
madness. They look on the miracles which God did by the saints to move the
vnbelevinge unto the faith and to confirm the troth of his promyses in
Christ / whereby all that beleve are made saints: True miracles are wrought
to cofirme the preachinge and not the Godheed of the preacher:
as thou seist in the last chaptoure of Mark. They preached (says he) every
where / the lord workinge with them and confirminge their preachinge with
miracles that followed. And in the fourth of the acts) the disciples praid that
God would stretche forth his hands to do miracles and wonders in the name of
Jesus And Paul.j. Corinth. xiiij. says / that the miracle of speakinge with
diverse tongues is but a sign for vnbelevers and not for them that beleve. These
miracles turn they unto a another purpose saying in Our ypocrites are blind
their blind hertes. Se what miracles God has showed for this saint / he
must be verily great with God. And attonse turn them selves from Gods word
and put their trust and confidence in the saint and his merits and make an
advocate or rather a God of the saint / and of their blind imaginacion make a
testamente or bond between the saint and them / the testamente of Christ's
blood clean forgoten. The religious look upon the out side only.
They look on the saints garments and lives or rather lies wihch men lie on
the saints: and this wise imagion in their hertes saying: the saint for
weringe soch a garmente and for soch deades is become so glorious in heven. If
I do like wise / so shall I be also. They se not the faith and trust which the
saints had in Christ / nether the word of God which the saints preached /
nether the entente of the saints / how that ye saints did soch things to
tame their bodies and to be an ensample to ye world / and to teach that soch
things are to be despiced which the world ^oost wondreth at and magnifieth.
They se not also that some lands are so whot that a man can nether drink wine
ner eat flesh there in: nether consider they the complexio^ of the saints /
and a thousand like things se they not. So when they have killed there bodies
and brought them in that case / that scace with any restauratyve they can
recover their health again yet had they lever die the^ to eat flesh. Why?
for they think / I have now this.xx.xxx. or.xl. years eaten no flesh and have
obtained I doubt not by this time as hie a rowme as the best of the^: should I
now loose that? nay I had lever die: and as lucrecia had lever have been slain
if he had not ben to strong for her then to have lost her glory / even so had
these. They ascribe heven unto their imaginacions and mad invencions / and
receave it not of the liberalite of God / by the merits and deservinges of
Chirst. The spiritual man.


He now that is renewed in Christ / keeps the law without any law written or
compulsion of any ruler or officer / save by the ledynge of the sprite only:
but the The natural man.
natural man is entised and moved to keep the law carnally / with carnal
reasons and worldly persuasions / as for glory / honor riches and dignite.
But the last remedy of all when all other fail / is Fear is the last remedy.
fear. Beat one and the rest will absteyne for fear: as Moses ever puts
in remembrance saying: kill / stone / burn. So shall thou put evil from the
/ and all Israel shall hear and fear and shall no moare do so. If fear
help not / then will God that they be taken out of this life.

Kings were ordened then / as I before said / and they sword put in their
hands to take vengeance of evil doers / that other might fear / and were
not ordained to fight one agenst a another or to rise agenste the Emperioure to
defend the false auctorite of the Pope that very Antechriste / Kings defend

their false doctrine and violence of sword enforce to que^che ye true doctrine
of Christ. And as thou can heal no disease / except thou begin at the

Agenst the popis false power.
Matthew. xxvi. Christ says unto Peter / put up thy swerd in to his shethe.
For all yt lay hand upon ye sword / shall peresh with ye sword / yt is /
whosoever without the co^maundment of the temperall officer to who^ God has
geven the sword leyeth hand on the sword to take vengeance / the same
deserves deeth in the dead doing. Not peter only but crist also was under
the te^perall sword.
God did not put Peter only under the temperall sword / but also Christ him
self. As it appereh in the fourth Chapter to the Galathiens. And Christ says
Math. iij. Thus becomes it us to fulfill all rightwesnes / that is to say /
all ordinances of God. If the head be then under the temperall sword / how ca^
the me^bres be excepted? If P^ter sinned in defendinge Christ agenste the
temperall sw^rde (whose auctorite and ministres the Bisshopes then abused
agenste Christ as ours do now) The kings sin in gevi^ge exe^pcions and the
prelates in receavi^ge them.
who can excuse our prelates of sin which will obey no man / nether king
nor Emperor? Ye who can excuse from sin / either the kings that geve /
either the Bisshopes that receave soch exempcions contrary to Gods ordinances
and Christ's doctrine?

And Math. xvij. both Christ and also Peter pay tribute / where the meaning
of Christ's question unto Peter is: if princes take tribute of straungres only
and not of their childern / then verily ought I to be fre which am the son of
God / whose servauntes and ministres they are and of whom they have their
auctorite. Yet because they nether knew that nether Christ came to use that
auctorite / but to be our servaunte and to bear our burden and to obey all
ordinances / both in right and wrong for our sakes and to teach us: therefore
said he to saint Peter. Pay for the and me lest we offend them. Moareover
though that Christ and Peter (because they were pore) might have escaped / yet
would he not for fear of offendinge other and hurtinge their consciences. For
he might well have geven occasion unto the tribute gatherers to have judged
amiss both of him and his doctrine: ye and ye Jews might happily have been
offended thereby and have thought that it had not be lawful / for them to have
paid tribute unto hethen princes and ydolaters / saying that he so great a
prophet paid not: Ye and what other thing causes the lay so little to
regard there princes / as that they se them both despised and disobeyed of the
spiritualte? When the spiritualte pays tribute
But our prelates which care for none offendinge of consciences and less for
Gods ordinances / will pay naught: but when princes must fight in our most
holy fathers quarrel and agenst christ. Then are they the first. There also is
none so pore that then has not somewhat to geve.

Shameless iugulars.
Mark here how past all shame our scole doctors are (as Rochester is in his
sermon agenst Marten Luther) which of this text of Matthew dispute that Peter
because he paid tribute / is gretter then the other Apostles / and has moare
auctorite and power then they / and was heed unto them all / contrary unto so
many clear textes / where Christ rebukes them saying: that is an hethenesh
thing that one should clyme above a another or desire to be greater To be great
in the kingdom of heven is to be a servaunte / and he that most humbles him
self and becomes a servaunt unto other (after the ensample of Christ I mean
and his Apostles and not of the Pope and his Apostles our Cardinales and
Bisshopes) the same is greatest in that kingdom. If Peter in payenge tribute
became greatest / how comes it / that they will pay none at all? But to pay
tribute is a sign of subjection verily / and the cause why Christ paid was
because he had an howsholde / and for the same cause paid Peter also. For he
had an house / a ship and nets / as thou read in the Gospel. But let us
goo to Paul again.

Wherefore ye must neades obey / not for fear of vengeance only: but also
because of conscience. That is though thou be so mighty (as now many years our
Pope and prelates every where are) that thou neadest not to obey the temperall
sword for fear of ve^geau^ce: yet must thou obey because of conscience.
First because of thine They make no conscience at any evell doi^ge.
own conscience. For though thou be able to resist / yet shall thou never
have a good conscience / as long as Gods word / law and ordinance are
agenste the. They care for there neybours as the wolf does for the sheep.
Secondarily for thy neighbors conscience. For though through craft and violence
thou might escape and obtain liberty or pri^elege to be fre from all manner
duites / yet ought thou nether to sue or seek for any soch thing / nether
yet admit or accept / if it were proffered The evell ensample of the
spiritualte causes the lay to beleve that they are not bound to obey.
lest thy fredome make thy weak brother to grudge and rebelle / in that he
sees the goo emp^^e and he him self moare lade / thy part also laid on his
shulders. Seist thou not if a man favor one son moare then a another / or
one servaunte moare then a another / how all the rest grudge / and how love /
peace and unity is broken? What christenly love is in the to thy neyboure ward
/ There is no christen love in t^em.
when thou can find in thine heart to goo up and down empty by him all
day long and se hi^ over charged / ye to faull under his burden / and yet
wilt not once set to thine hand to help him? What good conscience can there
be among our spiritualte to gather so great treasure to gether and with
ypocresie of their false lerninge to rob almost every man of house and lands
/ and yet not there with content but with all craft and wilenes to purchease so
great lyberties and exempcions from all manner bearinge with their brethren /
sekinge in Christ no thing but lucre? I pass over with syle^ce how they
teach princes in every land to lade new exaccions and tyra^nye on their
subjects moare and moare daily nether for what What purpose? even to flater
the princes that they may abyse there auctoryte to slay who so ever beleveth
in Christ and to mayntene the Pope.
purpose they do it say I. God I trust shall shortly disclose their iuggelinge
and bring their falshed to light and leye a medecin to them / to make their
scabbes break out. Never the less this I say / yt they have robbed all
realms / not of Gods word only: but also of all wealth and prosperity / and
have driven peace out of all lands and withdraune them selves from all
obedience to princes and have separated them selves from the lay men /
countinge them viler then dogs / and have set up that great ydole the whore
of Babilo^ Antychrist of Rome whom they call Pope and have conspired agenst all
commune wealths and have made them a several kyngedome / wherein it is
lawful vnpuneshed to work all abhominacion. In every paresh have they spies
and in every great man's house and in every tavern and Alehouse. And through

confessions know they all secrets / so that no man may open his mouth to
rebuke what so ever they do / but that he shall be shortly made an herytike.
Prelates know all men's secrets and no man theirs.
In all councels is one of them / ye the most part and chief rulars of the
councels are of them: But of there council is no man.

Even for this cause pay ye tribute' that is to wete / for consciences sake /
to thy neyboure / and for the cause that follows. For they are Gods ministers
servinge for the same purpose. Because God will so have it / we must obey. We
do not look (if we have Christ's spirit in us) what is good profitable /
glorious and honorable for us / nether on our own will / but on Gods will
only. Geve to everi man therefore his duty: tribute to whom tribute belongs:
custom to who^ custom is due: fear to who^ fear belongs: honor to who^
honor perteyneth.

That thou might feale the workinge of the spirit of God in the and lest
the beauty of the dead should deceave the and make the think that the law of
God which is spiritual were content and fulfilled with the outward and bodyly
dead it follows. Owe no thing to any man: but to love one an other. Love
fulfilleth the law before god and not the outward deed.
For he that loves a another fulfilleth the law. For these co^mau^dme^tes: thou
shall not commit advlterye / thou shall not kill / thou shall not stele /
thou shall not bear false witnese / thou shall not desire / and so forth if
there be any other co^maundeme^te are all comprehended or contained in this
saying: Agenst workmen.
love thy neyboure: therefore is love the fulfillinge of the law. Here have
thou sufficient agenst all the sophistres work holy and iustifiars in the
world / which so magnify their deeds. The law is spiritual and requires
the heart / and is never fulfilled with ye dead in the sight of God. With ye
dead The deed fulfilleth the la^^ before the world.
thou fulfillest the law before the world and lyvest thereby / that is / thou
enioyest this present life and avoydest the wrath and vengeance the deeth and
puneshment which the law thretneth to them that break it. But before God thou
kepest the law if thou love only. Now what shall make us love? Faith makes a
man love.
Verily that shall faith do. If thou behold how much God loves them Christ
and from what vengeance he has delyverde the for his fake and of what
kingdom he has made the heir / then shall thou se cause enough to love thy
very enemy without respect of reward / either in this life or in the life to
come / but because that God will so have it and Christ has deserved it: Ye
thou should feale in thine heart that all thy deades to come / are abundantly
recompensed already in Christ.

Thou will say happily / if love fulfill the law / the^ it Justifies. I say
that that where with a man fulfilleth the law / declares him justified but
that which geveth hi^ where with to fulfill the law / justifies him. By
iustifienge understand the forgiveness of sins and the favor of God.
Iustifiynge.
Now says the text Roma. x. the end of the law or the cause wherefore the
law was made is Christ to justify all that beleve. That is / the law is
geve^ to utter sin / to kill ye consciences / to da^ne our deades / to
bring to repe^tau^ce and to dryve unto Christ: The office or duty of the law.
in whom god has promised his favor and forgevenesse of sin unto all that
repent and co^sente to the law yt it is good. The belevi^ge of Gods promises
justifies.
If thou beleve the promises the^ does Gods truth justify the / yt is
forgeueth the and receaveth the to favor for Christ's sake. In a suertie where
of and to certify thine heart / he seals the with the sprite. Ephe. j.
and.iiij. And.ij. Corinth. v. says Paul. Which gave us his sprite in ernest.
How the sprite is geven us through Christ / read the eght chapter of the
pistle to the Romans and Gala. iij. and.ij. Corinth. iij. Nevertheless the
sprite The spirit and the i^ward virtues are known by the outward deed
and his fruits where with the heart is purified / as faith / hope / love /
patience / long soferinge and obedience / could never be seen without outward
experience. For if thou were not brought sometime in to combrau^ce / whence God
only could delyver the / thou should never se thy faith ye except thou
foughtest sometime against desperacio^ / hell / deeth sin and powers of this
world for thy faythes sake thou should never know true faith from a dream.
Except thy brother now and then offended the / thou coudest not know whether
thy love were Godly. For a turk is not anger / till he be hurt and offended
but if thou love hi^ that does the evyll / the^ is thy love of God / like wise
if thy rulers were all way kind / thou should not know whether thine
obedience were pure or no but and if thou can patiently obey evil rulers in
all thing that is not to ye dishonor of God and when thou hurtest not thy
neybours / the^ art thou sure / that Gods spirit works in the and that thy
faith is no dream nor any falls imaginacion.

Therefore counceleth Paul Roma. xij. recompense to no man evyll: And on your
part have peace with all men. Derely beloved avenge not your selves: but geve
rowme unto ye wrath of God. For it is written vengeance is mine and I will
reward / says the lord. Overcome thine enemy with well doing.
Therefore if thy enemy hongre feade him: If he thurst / geve him drink. For
in so doing thou shall heap coals of fire on his heed (that is thou shall
kendle love in him) Be not overcome of evil (that is let not a another man's
wekednesse make the weked also). But overcome evyll with good / that is / with
softness kyndnesse and all patience win him: eve^ as God with kyndnesse
won the.

THe law was geven in thunder lyghteninge / fire / smoke and the voice of a
trumpet and terreble sight. Exodi. xx. The law*
So that the people quoke for fear and stood a far of saying to Moses.
Speak thou to us and we will hear: let not the lord speak unto us / lest we
dye. No ear (if it be a waked and understands the meaning) is able to abide
the voice of the law: except the promises of mercy be by. That thunder
except the rain of mercy be joined with it / destroys all and byldeth not
The law is a witness agenste us and testifies that God abhors the sins
/ that is in us and us for our sins sake. The king:


In like manner when God gave ye people of Israel a king it thundered and
rayned that the people feared so sore yt they cried to Samuel for to pray for
them / that they should not dye.j. Regum.xij. As the law is a terreble thing:
even so is the king. For he is ordened to take vengeance and has a sword in
his hand and not pecockes feeders. Fear him therefore and look on him as thou
would look on a sharp sword that hanged over thy heed by an herre. Rulars
are Gods gift.


Heedes and governers are ordened off God and are even the gift of God /
whether they be good or bad. And what so ever is done unto us by the^ / that
does God / be it good or bad. If they be evil Why the rulers are evell
whi are ye evil? verily for our wekednesse sake are the evyll. Because that
when they were good we would not receave that goodness of the hand of God and
be thankful / submittinge our selves unto his laws and ordinances / but
abvsed the goodness of God unto our sensual and beestly lusts. Therefore
does God make his scorge of them and turn them unto wild beestes contrary to
ye nature of their names and offices / even in to lions / bears / foxes and
vncleyne swyne / to ave^ge hi^ self of our unnatural and blind unkindness
and of our rebellious disobedience.

In the.Cvj. psalm thou read / he destroyed the ryvers and dried up the
springes of water and turned the fruitful land in to bareness / for the
wekednesse of the inhabiters therein. When ye childer of Israel had forgoten
God in Egipte / God moved the hertes of the Egipcie^s to hate the^ and to
subdue the^ with craft and wilynes. Psalm. Ciiij. and deuteronomion.iij.
Moses reherseth saying: God was anger with me for your sakes: so yt the
wrath of God fell on Moses for the wekednesse of the people. And in the
second Chapter of the second book off kings God was angry with the people
and moved David to number them when Ioab and the other lords wondered why he
would have the^ nu^bred and because they feared lest some evyll should follow /
disuaded the king: yet it help* not. God so hardened his heart in his purpose
/ to have an occasion to sley the weked people. Evell rulers are a sign that
God is a^gre with us


Evyll rulers the^ are a sign yt God is angry and wroth with us. Is it not a
great wrath and ve^geau^ce yt the father and mother should hate there
childerne / eve^ their flesh and their blood? or yt an husband should be
vnki^de unto his wife or a master unto ye servaunte yt wayteth on h^s profit /
or yt lords and kings should be tirau^tes unto their subjects and tenau^tes
which pay the^ tribute / toll / custom and re^te / labori^ge and toyli^ge to
find the^ in honor and to mai^tene the^ in their estate? is not this a
fearful iudgeme^te of God and a cruel wrath yt the very prelates and
sheperdes of our souls which were wo^te to feed Christ's flock with Christ's
doctrine and to walk before them in lyvinge there after / and to geve their
lyves for them / to their ensample and edifienge / and to strength their weak
faythes / are now so sore changed that if they smell that one of their flock
(as they now call them and no longer Christ's) do but once long or desire for
the true knowleage of Christ / they will sley hi^ / burninge hi^ with fire
most cruelly? Why the prelates are so weked.
What is the cause of this / and that they also teach false doctrine
confirminge it with lies? verily it is the hand of God to avenge the wekednes
of them that have no love ner lust unto the truth of God / when it is
preached: but rejoice in unrighteous. As thou may se in the second pistle
of Paul to the Tessolonians. Where he speaks of ye coming of Antychriste.
Whose coming shall be (says he) by the workynge of Satan with all miracles
signs and wonders which are but lies / and in all deceavable vnreghteousnes
among the^ that perish / because they received not any love to the truth to
have be^ saved. The cause of false miracles is: that we have no lust unto the
truth^.
Therefore shall God send them strong delusion / to beleve lies. Mark how God
to avenge his troth / sends to the vntha^ckfull false doctrine and false
miracles to confirm the^ and to harde^ ye hertes in ye false way / yt
afterward it shall not be possible for the^ to admit the troth. As thou
seist in Exodi. vij. and viij. how God sofered false miracles to be showed in
the sight of Pharao to harde^ his heart / that he should not beleve the trou^h
/ form as much as his sorcerars turned their rods in to serpents and turned
water in to blood and made frogs by their inchauntme^t / so thought he that
Moses did all his miracles by the same craft and not by the power of God / And
abode therefore in unbelief and pereshed in resistinge God^

Let us receave all things of God whether it be good or badde: The right
way to come of bondage.
let us humble our selves under his myghtie hand and submit our selves
unto his nurtoure and chastisinge and not withdraw our selves from his
correccio^ (read Hebr. xij. For thy consorte) and let us not take the stafe by
the end or ^eke to ave^ge our selves on his rod which is the evil rulers.
The child as long as he seeks to ave^ge hi^ self apo^ ye rod has a^
evil heart. For he thi^keth not yt the correccio^ is right or yt he has
deserved it / nether repents / but reioyseth in his wekednes. And so long
shall he never be without a rod: ye so long shall the rod be made sherper
and sharper. If he knowleage his fault and take the correccion mekely and eve^
kiss the rod and amend him self with the lerninge and nurtoure of his
father and mother the^ is the rod take away and brunte

So if we resist evil rulers sekinge to set our selves at liberty / we
shall no doubt bri^ge our selves in to moare cruel bondage and wrappe our
selves in much moare misery and wrechednes. For if ye heddes overcome / the^
lay they moare weyghte on their backs and make their yoeke sorer and tie the^
shorter. If they over come their evyll rulers the^ make they way for a moare
cruel nacio^ or for some tyrau^te of their own nacio^ which has no right
unto the croune. If we submit our selves unto ye chastysinge of god and
mekely knowleage our sins for which we are scorged / and kiss the rod /
and amend our livinge: the^ will God take the rod away / that is / he will
geve the rulers a bettter heart. Or if they continue their malice and persecute
you for well doing and because ye put your trust in God / the^ will God
delyver you out of their tyranny for his trouthes sake. It is the same god now
that was in the old time and delyvered the fathers and the prophets / the
apostles and other holy saints. God is al way one all way true a ways
merciful and excludes noman from his promises.
And what so ever he swear to the^ he has sworn to us. And as he delyvered
them out of all temptacio^ co^braunce and adversite / because they consented
and submitted them selves unto his will and trusted in his goodness and truth:
eve^ so will he do us if we do like wise.

When so ever the childern of Israel fell from ye way which God commanded
the^ to walk in he gave them up under one tyraunte or a another. As soon as
they came to the knowleage of them selves and repented cryenge for mercy and
leninge unto the troth of his promyses he send one to delyver them / as the
histories of the bible make mention.

A Christen man in respect of God is but a passive thing / a thing that
sofereth only and does naught / as the sick in respect of the surgen or
phisicio^ does but suffer only. A christian man does but sofre only.
The surge^ launceth and cutteth out the deed flesh shercheth the wounds /
thrusts in tents / sereth / burns / sows or sticheth and leyeth to
corsies to draw out the corrupcion / and last of all leyeth to helinge
playsters and makes whole. The physician like wise geveth ^urgacions and
drinks to dryve out the disease and then with restauratives bri^geth health.
Now if the sick resist the raser the sherchinge yeron and so forth / does
he not resist his own health and is cause of his own deeth. So like wise is
it of us / if we resist evil rulers which are the Evil rula^s are
wholeso^medicines
rod and scorge where with God chastises us / the instruments where with
God shercheth our wou^des and bitter drinckes to dryve out the sin and to
make it appear / and corsies to draw out by the rotes ye core of the pox of
the soul that freteth inward. A christen man receavith
A Christen man therefore receaveth all thing of ye hand of God both good and
bad / both sweet and sour / both wealth and woe. If any person do me good /
whether it be father mother and so forth / that receave I of God and to God
geve thanks. For he gave where with / and gave a commandment / and moved
his heart so to do. Adversite also receave I of the hand of God as an
wholesome medicine / though it be some what bitter. Te^ptacion How profitable
adversite is.
and adversite do both kill sin and also utter it. For though a christen man
knowith every thing how to lyve: yet is the flesh so weak / that he can never
take up his cross him self to kill and mortify the flesh. He must have a
another to ley it on his back. In many also sin lies hid within and
festerth and rotteth inward and is not seen: so that they think how they are
good and perfect and keep the (...)* As the young man. Mathe. xix. said he
had observed all of a child and yet lied falsely in his heart / as ye text
folowinge well declares. When all is at peace and no man trobleth us / we
think that we are paciente and love our neybours as our selves: but let our
neyboure hurt us in word or dead and the^ find we it other wise. Then fume
we and rage and set up the bristels and bend our selves to take vengeance.
If we loved with godly love for Christ's kyndnes sake / we should desire no
vengeance / but pity him and desire God to forgeve and amend him knowinge
well that no flesh can do other wise then sin / except that God preserve
him. Thou will say what good does soch persecucio^ and tyranny unto the
righteous? First it makes them feale the workinge of Gods sprite in them and
that their faith is unfeigned. The greatest sinner is righteous in ^^se and the
promises. And the perfectest and holiest is a sinner i^ the law and the flesh.
Seco^daryly I say that no man is so great a sinner / if he repent and beleve
/ but that he is righteous in Christ and in the promises: yet if thou look on
the flesh and unto the law there is no man so perfect that is not found a
sinner. Ner any man so pure / that has not some what to be yet purged. This
shall suffice at this time as cocernynge obedience.

BE cause that God excludes no degree from his mercy. But whosoever repents
and beleveth his promises (of what soever degree he be of) the same shall be
partaker of his grace: therefore as I have described the obedience of them that
are under power and rule / even so will ^ I with gods help (as my duty is)
declare how the rulers which God shall vouchsafe to call unto the knowleage of
the troth ought to rule.

The office of a Father and how he should rule.
FAthers move not your childern unto wrath: but bring them up in the nurtour
and informacion of the lord. Ephe. vi. and Collos. iij. Fathers rate not your
cheldern / lest they be of desperate mind / that is / lest you discorage the^.
For where the fathers and mothers are weywarde hasty and churlish / ever
braulinge and chidinge: there are the childern anon discoraged and hertelesse
and apt for nothing nether can they do any thing aright Bring them up in
the nurtoure and informacion of the lord. The right bringinge up of childeren.
Teach them to know Christ and set Gods ordinance before them saying: son
or doghter God has created ye and made the through us thy father and mother /
and at his commaundmente have we so long thus kindly brought the up and kept
the from all perels he has commanded the also to obey us saye^ge: child
obey thy father and mother. if thou mekely obey / so shall thou grow both in
the favor of God and man and knowledge of our lord Christ. If thou will not
obey us at his co^maundmente? then are we charged to correct the / ye and if
thou repent not and amend thy self / God shall sley the by his officers or
punesh ye everlasti^gly. The destruc^ion and marrynge of childern
Nurtoure them not wordly and with wordli wisdom saying: thou shall come to
honor / dignite ^ promocio^ and riches / thou shall be better then soch and
soch / thou shall have.iij. or.iiij. benefices and be a great doctoure or a
bisshope and have so many men waytinge on the and do no thing but hawk and
hunte and lyve at pleasure / thou shall not need to sweet / to labor or to
take any pain for thy livinge and so forth / fillinge the^ full of pride /
disdain and ambicion and corruptinge their minds with worldly persuasions.
Let the fathers and mothers mark how they themselves were desposed at all ages
/ and by experience of their own infirmites help their childern and keep them
from occasions. Let them teach their childern to axe maryages of their fathers
and mothers. And let there elders provide marriages for them in season:
teachinge them also to know / that she is not his wife which the son takes
ner he her husband which ye doghter takes without ye co^sente and good will
of their elders or them yt have auctorite over the^. If there fre^des will not
mary^ the^ / the^ are they not to blame if they marye the^ selves. Let not ye
fathers and mothers always take ye vtte most of their auctorite of their
childern / but at a time sofre with the^ and bear their weaknesses as Christ
does ours. Seek Christ in your childern in your wives / servauntes and
subjects. Father / mother / son / doghter / master / servaunte / king and
subject / be names in the worldly regime^te. In Christ we are all one thing
/ none better the^ other / all brethern and must all seek Christ and our
brothers profit in Christ. In christ we are all saruauntes and he that has
knowledge is bound.
And he that has the knowledge whether he be lord or king / is bound to
submit hi^ self and serve his brethern and to geve him self for them / to
win them to Christ.

The office of an husband and how he ought to rule.
HVsba^des love your wives / as Christ loved the co^gregacio^ / and gave hi^
self for it / to sa^ctifie it and cle^se it. Men ought to love their wives as
their own bodies. For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall
co^tynue with his wife and shall be made both one flesh. Se that every one of you
love his wife eve^ as his own body: All this says Paul. Ephe. v. and Collo.
iij. he says husbands love your wives and be not bitter unto the^ / and
Peter in ye thread Chapter of his first pis^le says / Men ought to rule there
wives by Gods word.
me^ dwell with your wives accordi^ge to knowledge (that is accordi^ge to the
doctrine of Christ) gevi^ge revere^ce unto the wife / as unto ye weaker
vessel (yt is / help her to bear her infirmites) and as unto the^ that are
heirs also of ye grace of life / yt your prayers be not let. Why the man is
stronger the^ the woman.
In many things God has made ye me^ stronger the^ ye women / not to rage apo^
the^ and to be tyra^tes unto the^ but to help the^ to bear their weakness. Be
curtes therefore unto the^ and wi^ne the^ unto Christ and overcome the^ with
kyndnes / that of love they may obey ye ordinance that God has made between
man and wife.

The office of a master and how he ought to rule.
PAul Ephe. vj. says / ye masters do eve^ ye same things unto the^ (that is
/ be master after ye example and doctrine of Christ / as he before taught the
servauntes to obey unto there masters as unto Christ) puttinge away
thretnynges (that is / geve them fair words and exhort them kyndly to do
their duty: ye nurtoure them as thine awn sons with the lords Teach thy
servaunte to know christ and after christis doctrine deal with hi^
nurtoure / that they may se in Christ a cause why they ought lovingly to
obey) and remember (says he) that your master also is in heven. Nether is
there any respect of parso^s with him / that is / he is indifferente and not
perciall: as great in his sight is a seruau^te as a master. And the thride
chap. to the Collo. says he / ye masters do unto your servauntes that which is
just and equal / reme^bringe that ye also have a master in heve^. Geve your
servauntes kind words / fode / rayme^te and learning. Be not bitter unto them
/ rail not on them geve the^ no cruel countenance: but according to the
ensample and doctrine of Christ / deal with the^. And when they labor sore
cherish the^ again. When ye correck them Do all thing with Gods word
let Gods word be by and do it with soch good manner yt they may se how that
ye do it to amend the^ only / and to bri^ge the^ unto the way which God
bids us walk in / and not to avenge your selves or to wreke your malice
on the^. If at a time through hastynes ye exceade measure in punishinge /
recompense it a another way and pardon them a another time.

The duty of londelordes.
LEt Christen londlordes be content with their re^te and old customs not
reysinge the rent or fyens and bringinge up new customs to oppress their
tenau^tes: nether lettinge.ij. or.iij. tenauntryes unto one man Let them not
take in their co^munes nether make parkes nor pastors of hole perishes. For
God gave the earth to me^ to inhabit / and not unto sheep and wild deree. God
gave the earth to men
Be as fathers unto your tenauntes: ye be unto the^ / as Christ was unto us /
and show unto the^ all love / and kyndnes. What soever business is among them /
be not parciall faveringe one moare the^ a another. The complayntes / quarrels
and strife that are among the^ / count diseases of sick people and as a
mercy full physician heal them with wisdom and good council. Be pitiful and
tender herted unto them and let not one of thy tenau^tes tear out a nothers
throat / but judge their causes indifferently and compel the^ to make their
diches / hedges / gates and ways. For even for soch causes were ye made
landlordes / and for soch causes paid men rent at the beginning. For if soch
an order were not one should sley a another and all should goo to wast. If thy
tenaunte shall labor and toil all the year to pay ye thy re^te and when he
has bestowed all his labor / his neyboures cattle shall devour his fruits
/ how tedyous and bitter should his life be? Se therefore that ye do your
duties again and sofre no man to do them wrong / save the king only. If he
do wrong / the^ must they abide Gods judgment.

The duty of kings and of the Judges and officers.
LEt kings (if they had lever be christen in deed then so to be called) geve
them selves all to geder to ye wealth of their realms after the ensample of
Christ: reme^bringe that the people are Gods and not theirs: ye are Christ's
enheritau^ce and possession bought with his blood. The most despised person in
his realm is the kings brother and fellow member with him and equal with him
in the kyndome of God and of Christ. Let him therefore not think him self to
good to do them service nether seek any other thing in them / then a father
seeks in his childern ye then Christ sought in us. Though that the king in
the temporal regimente be in the rowme of God and represents God him self
and is without all comparison better then his subjects: yet let him putt of
that and become a brother / doing and levinge un done all things in respect
of the common wealth / yt all men may se yt he seeks no thing / but ye
profit of his subjects. When a cause yt requires execucio^ is brought before
him the^ only let him take the parson of God on him. The^ let hi^ know no
creature but hear all indifferently / whether it be a stranger or one of his
own realm / and the small as well as the great and judge righteous for the
iudgeme^te is the lords Deute. j. In time of judgment he is no minister in
the kingdom of Christ: he preaches no Gospel / but the sharp law of
vengeance. Let him take the holy judges of the old testame^te for an example
and namely Moses
Moses which in executinge the law was merciless otherwise moare then a
mother unto them never avenginge his own wrongs but soferi^ge all thing /
bearinge every ma^s weakness teachinge / warninge / exhortinge and ever caringe
for them and so tenderly loved them / that he desired God either to forgeve them
or to damn him with them.

Let the judges also privately when they have put of the person of a judge
exhort with good council and warn the people and help / Judges.
that they come not at Gods judgment: but the causes that are brought unto
them / when they sit in Gods stead / let them judge / and condemn the
trespaser under lawful witnesses and not break up in to the consciences of
men / after the ensample of Antychristes disciples / O tyranny to compel a man
to accuse him self
and co^pel them either to forswere them selves by the almighty God and by the
holy Gospel of his merciful promises or to testify against the^ selves. Which
abhominacio^ our prelates learned of Our prelates learned of Cayphas^
Cayphas Math. xxvj. saie^ge to Christ / I adjure or charge the in ye name of
the livi^ge God / yt thou tell us wether thou be christ ye son of God Secret
sins perteyne unto God to punish and open sins unto the king
Let yt which is secret to God only / where of no proof can be made ner
lawful witness brought / abide unto the cominge of the lord which shall
open all secrets. If any malice break forth / that let the^ judge only^ For
forther auctorite has God not geven them.

Moses Deutero. xvij. warns judges to keep the^ vppright and to look on no
man's person / yt is / that they prefer not ye hye before the low / the great
before the small / the rich before the pore / his accoyntaunce friend kynsman /
country man or one of his own nation before a stranger / a friend or an
alie^t ye or one of their own faith before an infidel: but that they look on
the cause only to judge indifferently. For the rowme that they are in and the
law that they execute are Gods / which as he has made all and is God of all
and all are his sons: even so is he judge over all and will have all judged
by his law indifferently and to have the right of his law / and will avenge
the wrong done unto the turk or sareson. For though they be not under the
everlastinge testame^te of God in Christ / as few of us which are called
Christen be / and even no mo then to whom God has sent his promyses and
powered his sprite in to their hertes to beleve them / and through faith graven
l^st in their hertes to fulfill the law of love: yet are they under the
testamente of the law natural which is the laws of every land made for the
comen wealth there and for peace and unite that one may lyve by a another. In
which laws the infideles (if they keep them) have promyses of worldly things.
Whosoever therefore hinderth a very infidel from the right of that law /
synneth agenst God and of him will God be avenged. Moare over Moses warns
them that they receave no gifts / rewards or brybes. For those two points /
favoringe of one person moare then a another and receavinge rewards perverte
all right and equite and is the only pestilence of all judges.

And the kings warns he that they have not to many wives / lest their hertes
turn away:
and that they read all way in the law of God / to learn to fear him / lest
their hertes be lift up above their brethern. Which two points / women and
pride the dispisinge of their subjects / which are in very dead their own
brethern / are the comen pestilence of all princes. Read the stories and se.

The shirereves / bailey arau^tes / co^stables and soch like officers may let no
man that hurts his neyboure escape / but that they bring them before the
judges / except they in the mean time agree with their neybours and make them
amends.

Let kings defend their subjects from the wrongs of other nations / but
pick no quarrels for every tryfyl / no let not our most holy father make them
no moare so dronke^ with Vain names
vain names / with cappes of mayntenaunce and like babels / as it were popetry
for childern to bedger their realms and to murder their people / for
defendinge of our holy fathers tyranny. The holy father lowseth peace and
vnile truce troth and all honest.
If a lawful peace that stondeth with Gods word be made between prince and
prince and the name of God taken to record and the body of our savioure
broken between the^ / upon the bond which they have made / that peace or bond
can ourer holy father not despe^ce with / nether lowse it with all the keys he
has: no verily Christ can not break it. For he came not to break the law
but to fulfill it Math. v.

If any man have broken the law or a good ordinance and repent and come to
the right way again / then has Christ power to forgeve him: but license to
break the law can he not geve / much moare his disciples and vicars ((...)
they call the^ selves) ca^ not do it. The What the keys are and why they are
so called.
keys where of they so greatly bost them selves are no carnal things but
spiritual and no thing else save knowledge of the law and of the promyses or

parsone of all Mathe. xvi. And in ye.xx. of The keys are paid

With preachinge the promises lowse they as many as repe^te and beleve. And for
yt John says receave the holy gooste / Luke in his last chapter says then
opened he their wits / that they might understand ye scriptures and said
unto the^: thus it is written. And thus it behoved Christ to sofre and to rise
again the third day. And that Repentance and forge^venes come by preaching.
repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all
nations. At preachinge of the law repent me^ and at the preachinge of the
promises do they beleve and are saved Petre practices his keys.
. Peter in the secon^ of the Acts practiced his keys and by preachinge the
law brought the people in to the knowleage of them selves and bound their
consciences / so that they were pricked in their hertes and said unto Peter and
to the other Apostles / what shall we do? Then brought they forth the keye of
the sweet promises saying: repent and be baptized every one of you in the
name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins / and ye shall receave the
gift of the holy gooste. For the promise was made unto you and unto your
childern and to all that are a far even as many as the lord shall call. Of
like ensamples is the Acts full and Peter's pistles / and Paul's pistles and all
the scripture / The popis auctorite: is to preach good word only
nether has our holy father any other auctorite of Christ or by the reason of
his predicessor Peter the^ to preach Gods word. As Christ compares the
understanding of scripture unto a keye / so co^pareth he it to a net and
unto leven and unto many other things for certain properties. Beware of the
nett and of the leven and of the counterfeit keys of our holy father*
I mervell therefore that they bost not the^ selves of their net and leve^ /
as well as of their keys / for they are all one thing But as Christ bids
us beware of ye leve^ of the pharisees / so beware of their counterfeted keys
and of their false net (which are their traditions and ceremonies their
ypocrisy and false doctrine) where with they ketche / not souls unto Christ /
but auctorite and riches unto them selves.

Let christian kings therefore keep their faith and truth and all lawful
promises and bo^des / not one with an other only / but eve^ with ye Turk or
what soever infidel it be. Not with an her^^ike says the Pope
For so it is right before God as the scriptures and examples of ye Bible
testify. Whosoever vow a^ unlawful vow / promise an unlawful promise swear
an unlawful oath sins against God: and ought therefore to break it.
Unlawful vows or oaths are men commanded to break.
He needs not to sue to Rome for a license. For he has Gods word / and not a
license only: but also a co^mau^dme^te to break it. They therefore that are
sworn to be true unto Cardinals and Bisshopes / yt is to say false unto God
ye king and the realm / may break their oaths lawfully without grudge of
conscience by the auctorite of Gods word. In maki^ge them they sinned / but in
repentinge and breakinge them they please God hyly and receave forgevenes in
Christ.

Let kings take their duty of their subjects and that yt is necessary unto
the defense of the realm. Let the^ rule their Realms them selves with the
help of lay me^ that are sage wise / learned and expert. Is it not a shame
obove all shames and a monstrous thing yt no man should be found able to
govern a worldly ki^gdome save Bisshopes and prelates that have forsaken the
world and are taken out of the world and appointed to preach the kingdom of
God? Bisshapes
Christ says that his kingdom is not of this world John. xviij And Luke.
xij. unto the young man that desired hi^ to bid his brother to geve hi^
part of the encheritaunce / he answered who made me Be hold the face of the
pope and of the bisshopes in this glass
judge or a devider a monge you No man that lays his hand to the plowe and
looks back is apt for the kingdom of heven. Luke. ix. No man ca^ serve two
masters but he must despice the one. Math. vj.

To preach Gods word is to much for half a man. And to minister a te^porall
ki^gdome is to much for half a man also. Either other requires an hole man. One
therefore can not well do both. He that ave^geth him selve on every tryfell is
not mete to preach ye patience of Christ / how that a man ought to forgeve and
to sofre all things. He that is overwhelmed with all manner riches and does but
seek moare daily / is not mete to preach poverte. He that will obey no man is
not mete to preach how we ought to obey all me^ Peter says Act. vj. It is not
mete that we should leave the word of God and serve at the tables. Paul says
in the.ix. chapter of the first Corinthe. Woe is me if I preach not. A terryble
saying verily for Popes / Cardinals / and Bisshopes. If he had said woe be to
me if I fight not and move princes unto war. or if I increase not sent Peter's
Peter's patrimony.
patrimony (as they call it) it had bynne a moare easy saying for them.

Christ forbids his disciples and that often (as thou may se Matthew. xviij.
The Popi^ auctorite is i^proved.
And also.xx. Mark. ix. and also.x. Luke ix. and also.xxij. Even at his last
soper) not only to clyme above lords / kings and emperors in worldly rule /
but also to exalte them selves one above a another in the ki^gdome of God. But
in vain: for the Pope would not hear it though he had commanded it ten
thousand times / Gods word should rule only and not Bisshopes decrees or ye
Popes pleasure. Bisshopes have captived Gods word with there own decre^.
That ought they to preach purely and spiritually and to fascion their lives
there after and with all ensample of Godly lyvynge and long soferinge / to
draw all to Christ: and not to expound the scriptures carnally and wordly
saying: God spoke this to Peter and Iam his successoure / therefore this
auctorite is mine only: and the^ bring in the tyranny of their flesly wisdom
/ in presentia maioris cessat ^otestas minoris / that is in the presens of the
greater the less has no power. There is no brotherhed where soch philosophy
is taught

SOch philosophy and so to abuse the scriptures and to mock with Gods word is
after ye manner of ye Bisshope of Rochesters Rochester.
divininite. For he in his sermon of the condemnacion of Marten Luther proves
by ashadowe of the old testamente / that is by Moys^s and Aaron that / Satan
and Antychriste our most holy father the Pope is Christ's vicare and head of
Christ's congregation.

Moses (says he) signifies Christ / and Aaron the Pope. And yet the pistle
unto the Hebrews proves that the hie priest of the old law signifies Christ
/ and his offeri^ge and his goinge in once in the year in to the inner temple
signify ye offeri^ge where with Christ offered him self and Christ's goinge
in unto ye father to be an everlastinge mediator or intercessor for us.
Nevertheless Rochester proves ye contrary by a shadow: by a shadow verily.
For in shadows they walk with out alshame / and ye light will they not come
at but enforce to stop and quench it wiih all craft and falshed / lest their
abominable iugulinge should be seen. They walk in shadows.
If any man look in the light of the new testamente / he shall clearly se /
that that shadow may not be so understand.

Understand therefore that one thing in the scripture represents diverse
things. A serpente figureth Christ in one place and the devell in a another.
And a lion does likewise. Christ by leven signifies Gods word in one place
/ and in a another signifies thereby the traditions of the Phareses which sowred
and altered Gods word for their avauntage. Now Moses verily in the said place
represents Christ / Aaron is every true preacher.
and Aaron which was not yet hye pressed / represented / not Peter only or his
successoure / as my lord of rochester would have it (for peter was to little to
bear Christ's message unto all the world) but signifies every disciple of
christ and every true preacher of gods word. For moses put in Aarons mouth /
what he should say / and Aaron was Moses prophet and spoke / not his own
message (as the pope and Bisshopes do) but that which Moses had received of
God and delivered unto him Exodi. iiij. and also.vij. So ought every preacher
to preach Gods word purely and nether to add nor minishe. A true messenger
must do his message truly and say nether moare nor less then he is
commanded. Aaron represents christ.
Aaron when he is hye priest and offers and purges the people of their
worldly sin which they had fallen in in ^wichinge uncleanly things and in
eatinge meats forbidden (as we sin in handelinge the chalice and the
alterston and are purged with the Bisshopes blessinge) represents Christ /
which purges us from all sin in the sight of God / as the pistle unto the
hebrews makes mention. When Moses was gone Up in to the mounts and Aaron left
behind and made the golden calfe / there Aaron represents all false
preachers and namely our most holy father the Pope / which in like manner
makes us beleve in a bulle / as ye Bisshope of Rochester fullwell alegeth the
place in his sermon.

If the Pope be signified by Aaron and Christ by Moses / why is not the Pope
as well content with Christ's law and doctrine / as Aaron was with Moses?
Aaron adds no thing to Mosesis law.
What is ye cause yt our Bisshopes preach the pope and not Christ saying the
Apostles preached not Peter / but Christ. The apostels preached not peter: But
christ
Paul.ij. Cori^the. iiij. says of him self and of his fellowpostles: we
preach not our selves / but Christ Jesus the lord: and preach our selves
your servantes for Jesus sake. And.j. Corin. iij. Let no man rejoice in men.
For all things are youres / whether it be Paul / or Apollo / or Peter: whether
it be the world / or life or deeth / whether they be present things or things
to come: all are youres and ye are Christ's and Christ is Gods. He leveth out
ye are Peter's or ye are the Popes. And in the chapter folowinge he says. Let
men thus wise esteem us / even the ministers of Christ. and cet. And.ij.
Corinthiorum. xj. Paul was gelous over his Corrinthians / because they fell
from Christ / to whom he had married them / and clave unto the auctorite of men
(for even then false Prophets sought auctorite in the name of the hy^
Apostles) I am says he gelouse over you with Godly gelousy. For I coupled you
to one man / to make you a chaste virgen to Christ: but I fear lest as the
serpente deceaved Eve through his sottylte / even so your wits should be
corrupt from the singleness that is in Christ. And it follows: If he that
comes to you preached a another * Jesus / or if ye receave a another sprite or a
another * Gospel / then might ye well have be content / that is / ye might
have well sofered him to have auctorite above me. But I suppose (says ^e) that
I was not behind the hye Apostles: meaning in preachinge Jesus and his
Gospel and in ministringe the sprite. And in the said.xj. Chapter he proves
by the doctrine of Christ / that he is greater then the hye Apostles. For
Christ says / to be great in the kingdom of God / is to do service and
take pain for other. Apo^ which rule Paul is greater then the hye apostels.
Paul dis^ute^h saying: if they be the ministres of Chr^ste I am moare. In
labors moare aboundau^^e / in stripes above measure in prison moare plentuosly
/ in deeth often and so forth. P^ul is greater ^he peter
If Paul preached Christ moare then Peter and sofered moare for his
congregation / then is he greater the^ Peter by ye testimony of Christ. And
in the.xij. he says / In nothing was I inferior unto ye hye Apostles^ Though
I be nothing / yet the tokens of an Apostle were wrought among you with all
patience / with signs and wonders and mighty deeds. Paul proved his
appostelshep with preachinge and soferinge: The bisshopes prove there
apostelshepe with bulls and shadows

The Postels were sent of christ with li^e auctorite*


So proved he his auctorite and not with a bulle from Peter sealed with cold
leed / other with shadows of the old testamente falsely expounded.

Moare over the Apostles were sent immediately of Christ and of Christ
received they their auctorite / as Paul bosteth him self every where. Christ
(says he) sent me to preach the Gospel.j. Cor. i. And I received of the lord
that which I delyverd unto you.i. Corinth. xi And Gala. i. I certify you
brethern that the Gospel which was preached of me / was not after the manner of
me^ (that is to wete carnal or fleshly) nether received I it of man / nether
was it taught me: but I received it by the revelacion of Jesus Christ. And
Galath. ij. he that was mighty in Peter in the Apostleshep over the
circumcision / was mighty in me among the gentiles. And.i. Timoth. i. Read
thou like wise. And John. xx. Christ sent them forth indifferently and gave
them like power. As my father sent me (says he) so send I you: yt is to
preach and to sofre / as I have done / and not to co^quere empyres and
kingdoms and to subdue all temperall power under you with disgysed ypocrisie.
He gave them the holy gooste to bind and lowse indifferently / as thou seist:
and afterward he sent forth Paul with like auctorite / as thou seist in the
Acts. And in the last of Matthew says he: all power is geven me in heven and
in earth goo therefore and teach all nations baptisinge them in the name of the
father and of the son and of the holy ghost / teachi^ge the^ to observe what
so ever I commanded you: The auctorite The auctorite that Christ gave was to
preach Christ's word.
that Christ gave them was to preach / yet not what they would imagen / but
what he had commanded. Loo says he / I am with you all ways / eve^ unto the
end of the world. He said no^ I goo my way / and loo here is Peter in my
stead: But send them every man to a sundry country / whother so ever the
spirit carried the^ / and went with them him self. And as he wrought with
Peter where he went / so wrought he with the other where they went / as Paul
bosteth of him self unto the Galathiens.
Saying now that we have Christ's doctrine and Christ's holy promyses / and
saying that Christ is ever present with us his own self / how comes it that
Christ may not raygne immediately over us / as well as the Pope which comes
never at us? Saying also that the office of an Apostle is to preach only / how
can the Pope kale^ge with right / any auctorite where he preaches not?. How
comes it also that Rochester will not let us be called one congregation be the
reason of one God / one Christ / one sprite / one Gospel / one faith one hope
/ and one baptim / as well as because of one pope?

If any natvrall be with his worldly wisdom stri^e /
that one is greater then a another / because that in congregations one is sent
of a another / as we se in the Acts. I answer that Peter sent no man / but was
sent him self / and John was sent / and Paul / Sylas and Barnabas ware sent.
How be it soch manner sendinges are not worldly / as princes send their
Ambasadours no ner as freres send their limyters to gather there bretherhedes
which must obey whether they will or will not. Here all thing is fre and
willingly. And the holy ghost brings them to gether which makes their wills
fre and ready to bestow them selves upon their neybours profit. And they that
come / offer them selves and all that they have or can do / to serve the lord
and their brethern. And every man / as he is found apt and mete to serve his
neyboure / so is he sent or put in office. And of the holy ghost are they sent
with the consent of their brethern and with their own consent also. And Gods
word rules in that congregation / unto which word every man confirms his
will. And Christ which is all way present is the head. Why bisshopes make
the^ a god on earth
But as our Bisshopes hear not Christ's voice / so se they him not present:
and therefore make them a God on the earth / of they Aaron made a calfe. And the
Pope makes bulls
kind (I suppose) of Aarons calfe. For he brings forth no other fruit but
bulls.

For as much also as Christ is as great as Peter / why is not his seat as
great as Peter's? Had the heed of the empire been at Iherusalem / their had been
no mention made of Peter. It is verily / as Paul says in the eleventh Chapter
of the second Pistle to the Corinthyans. The false Apostles are desceatefull
workers / and fassion them selves like unto the Apostles of Christ. That is
the shaven The shaven nation has put christ out of his rowme and all kings
and the emperor.
nation preached Christ falsely / ye under the name of Christ preached them
selves and raygne in christ's stead: have also taken away the keye of knowledge
and have wrapped the people in ignorance and have taught the^ to beleve in
the^ selves / in their traditions and false ceremonies: so yt christ is but a
vain name. Christ is but a vain name.

so yt ye emperor and kings are but vain names and shadows / as Christ is
/ havinge no thing to do in the world. Thus raygne they in the stead of God
and man and have all power under them and do what they list.

Let us se a another point of our great clerk. Rochester is proved both
ignorant and malicious
A little after the beginnynge of his sermon / entendinge to prove that which
is clearer then the son and serves no moare for his purpos then Ite missa
est serves to prove that our lady was borne without original sin: he
allegeth a saying that Marte^ luther says / which is this if we affirm that
any one pistle of Paul or any one place of his pistles perteyneth not unto the
universal chirch / that is / to all the congregation of them that beleve in
Christ / we take a way all saint Paul's auctorite. Where upon says
Rochester. If it be thus of the words of saint Paul much rather it is true of
the Gospels of Christ and of every place of them. O malicious blindness First
note his blindness. He understands by this word Gospel no moare but the four
evangelistes Matthew / Mark / Luke and John and thinks not that the Acts of
the apostles and the pistles of Peter / of Paul and of John and of other like
are also the Gospel Paul calls his preachinge the Gospel. The pistles of
Paul are the Gospel:
Roma. ij. and.j. Cori. iiij. and Gal. j. and.j. Timoth. j. The Gospel is
every wheere one though it be preached of diverse and What Gospel signifies.
signifies glad tidinges / that is to wete / an open preachinge of Christ and
the holy testame^te and gracious promises that God has made in Christ's blood
to all that repent and beleve. Now is there moare Gospel in one pystle of
Paul / that is to say / Christ is moare clearly preached and moo promises
rehearsed in one pistle of Paul / the^ in ye.iii. first Eva^gelistes. Matthew /
Mark and Luke.

Considre also his maliciousnes / how wekedly and how craftily he takes away
the auctorite of Paul. It is much rather true of the Gospells and of every
place in the^ then of paul. One Gospel one spirit: one truth.
If that which the four Eva^gelistes wrote be truer then that which Paul wrote
/ then is it not one Gospel that they preached / nether one sprite that taught
them. If it be one Gospel and one sprite / how is one truer then the other?
The auctorite of paul and of his Gospel:
Paul proves his auctorite to the Galathians and to the Corinthians / because
that he received his Gospel by revelacion of Christ and not of man / and
because that when he comuned with Peter and the hye Apostles of his Gospel and
preachinge / they could improve no thing / nether teach him any thing: and
because also that as many were converted and as great miracles showed by his
preachinge as at the preachinge of the hye Apostles / and therefore will be of no
less auctorite / then Peter and other hye Apostles. Ner have his Gospel of
less reputacion the^ there is

Finally that thou may know Rochester for ever and all the remaunte by him /
what they are with in ye skin / mark how he plays bo pepe with the
scripture. Rochester plays bo pepe.
He allegeth the beginnynge of the tenth chapter to the Hebrews. Vmbram habens
lex futurorum bonorum / the law has but a shadow of things to come. And
immediately expounds the figure clean contrary unto the chapter folowinge and
to all the hole pistle / making Aaron a figure of the Pope whom the Epistle
makes a figure of Christ.

He allegeth half a text of Paul. j. Timoth. iiij. In the later days some
shall depart from the faith gevi^ge head unto sprites of errore and develish
doctrine: but it follows in the text / gevinge attendaunce or head unto the
develish doctrine of them which speak false through ypocrisye and have their
consciences marked with a hot yeron / forbiddinge to mary and commaundinge to
absteyne from meats which God has created to be received with gevinge
thanks. Which two things who ever did save the Never man forbade to mary save
the pope
Pope Rochersters God / making sin in the creatures which God has created
for man's use to be received with thanks. The kingdom of heven is not meat
and drink / says Paul / but righteousness peace and Joy in the holy ghost.
For who so ever in these things serves Christ pleases God and is allowed of
men Roma. xiiij. Had Rochester therefore not a conscience marked with the hot
yeron of malice / so that he can not consent unto the will of God and glory
of christ / he would not have so alleged the text which is contrary to none
save them selves.

He allegeth an other text of Paul in the second chapter of his second
pistle to the Tessaloniens. Erit disessio primum / that is says Rochester /
before the coming of Antychrist there shall be a notable departinge from the
faith. And Paul says. The lord comes not except there come a departinge
first. Paul's meaning is that the last day comes not so shortly / but that
antychrist shall come first and destroy the faith and sit in the temple of God
and make all men whorshepe him and beleve in him (as the Pope does) and then
shall Gods word come to light again (as it does at this time) and destroy
him and utter his iuglynge and then comes christ unto judgment. What say
ye of this crafty convayar? Would he spare / suppose ye to allege and to wreste
other doctors pestile^tly / which fears not for to iugle with ye holy
scripture of god expou^dinge yt unto antychrist which Paul speaks of Christ?
No be thou sure. But eve^ after this manner wise perverte they the hole
scripture and all doctors wrestinge the^ unto their abominable purpose clean
contrary to the meaning of the text and to the circumstaunces that goo before
and after. The cause why they will not have the scripture in english.
Which develish falsheed left the lay men should perceave / is the very cause
why that they / will not sofre the scripture to be had in the englysh tongue /
nether any work to be made / that should bring the people to knowleage of the
truth.

He allegeth for the Popes auctorite saint Cipriane / saint Augustine / Ambrose
/ Hierom and Origene: of which never one knew of any auctorite yt one Bisshope
should have above a another. And saint Gregory allegeth he which would receave
no soch auctorite above his brethern when it was proferd him. As the manner is
to call Tully chief of orators.
Tully chief of Orators for his singular eloquence / and Aristotle chief of
philosophers and Virgill chief of Poets for their singular learning / and not
for any auctorite that they had over other: so was it the manner to call Peter
chief of the Apostles for his singular activite and boldness / and not that he
should be lord over his brethern contrary to his own doctrine. Yet compare
that chief Apostle unto Paul / and he is found a great way inferior. This I
say not that I would that any man should make a God of Paul / contrary unto
his own learning. Not withsta^dinge yet this manner of speakinge is left unto
us of our elders that when we say the Apostle says so / we understand Paul
for his excellency above other Apostles. I would he would tell you how Hierom /
Augustine / Bid / Origene and other doctors expound this text upon this
rock I will bylde my congregation and how they enterpret the keys also.
Thereto / Pasce / pasce / pasce / which Rochester leaves without any english
signifies not Poll / shere and shave. Upon which text behold the faithful
exposicion of Bid.

Note also how craftyly he would enfeffe the Apostles of Christ with their
weked traditions and false Ceremonies which they them selves have feigned /
alleginge Paul. ij. Rochester allegeth Paul for his blind ceremonies contrary
to paul's doctrine.
Thessal. ij. I answer that Paul taught by mouth soch things as he wrote in
his pistles. And his tradicions ware the Gospel of Christ and honest manners
and lyvinge and soch a good order as becomes the doctrine of Christ. As that
a woman obey her husband / have her heed covered / keep silence and goo
woomanly and christenly apparelde: that childern and servau^tes be in
subjection: and that the young obey their elders / that no man eat but he
that labors and works / and that men make an ernest thing of Gods word
and of his holy sacraments and to watch fast and pray and soch like / as the
scripture commands. which things he that would break were no Christian man.
But we may well compain and cry to God for help / that it is not It is not
lawful for us to tell what prayar is what fasting is or where fore it ^arvith
lawful for the Popes tyranny / to teach the people what prayer is / what
fasting is and wherefore it serves. There were also certain customs all way
which were not commanded in pain of hell or everlastinge damnacio^ / as to
watch all night / and to kiss one a another: which as soon as the people
abused the^ they brake them. For which cause ye Bisshopes might break many
things now in like manner. Paul also in many things which God had made fre /
gave pure and faithful cowncell without tanglinge of any ma^s conscience and
without all manner commaundinge under Pain of cursynge da^nacion and so forth
pain of cursinge / pain of excommunication / pain of heresy / pain of
burninge / pain of deedly sin / Pain of hell and pain of da^nacio^. As
thou may se.j. Corin. vij. Where he counceleth the unmarried the widows and
virgens that it is good so to abide / if they have the gift of chastyte. Not to
win heve^ thereby (for nether circuncisio^ nether vncircuncision is any thing
at all / But the kepinge of the commandments is all to gether) But that they
might be without trouble / and might also the better wait on Gods word and
frelyer serve their brethern. And says (as a faithful servaunte) that he had
none If Paul had none auctorite: then had Peter none where had then the pope
this auctoryte
auctorite of the lord to geve them any commaundeme^te. But that the Apostles
gave us any blind ceremonies where of we should not know the reason that I
deny and also defy / as a thing clean contrary unto the learning of Paul
every where.

For Paul commands that no man ones speak in the church / that is /
Rochester is improved
in the congregation / but in a tongue that all men understood / except that
there be an enterpreter by he commands to labor for knowleage /
understanding / and felinge and to be ware of supersticio^ and persuasions of
worldly wisdom / philosophy / and of ypocrisy and ceremonies / and of all
manner disgisinge / and to walk in the plain and open truth. Ye were once
darkness (says he) but now are ye light in the lord / walk therefore as the
childern of light. Ephe. v. how does Paul also wysh the^ increase of grace in
every pistle? How cries he to God to augmente their knowledge / that they
should be no moare childern waveringe with every wind of doctrine / but would
vouchsafe to make them full men in Christ and in the understanding of the
mysteries or secrets of Christ: so that it should not be possible for any man
to disceave them with any entisinge reasons of worldly wisdom / or to begyl^
the^ with blind ceremonies or to lead the^ out of ye way with
supersticiousnes of dysgised ypocrisy / unto which full Wherefore the
spiritual off^cers ar ordained.
knowledge are the spiritual officers ordened to bring the^ Ephe. iiij. So
far it is away that Christ's Apostles should geve them traditions of blind
ceremonies without significacio^ or of which no man should know the reason as
Rochester which loves shadows and darkness lies on them god stop his
blasphemous mouth.

Ro^hester allegeth heretics for his purpose for la^ke of scripture
Consydre also how studiously Rochester allegeth origin / both for his Pope and
also to stablish his blind ceremonies with all which Origene of all heritkes is
condemned to be the greatest. He is an ancient doctor says he / ye and to
whom in this point great fayeth is to be geven: ye verily Aristotle and
Plato and even very Robynhode is of auctorite enough to prove the pope with all.
Robynhode is to be beleved in soch a point / that so greatly maynteneth our
holy fathers auctorite and all his disgysynges.

Last of all as once a crafty thief when he was espied and followed / cried
unto the people. Stop the thief / stop the thief. And as many to begin
with all cast first in a another man's tethe that which he fears should be lead
to his own charge: eve^ so Rochester lays to Martyn Luthers charge the
slayenge and murtheringe of Christen me^ / because they will not beleve in his
doctrine / which thing Rochester and his brethern have not ceased to do now
certain hundred years / with soch malice that when they be deed / they rage
burning the bodies / of which some they them selves of lyckly hode killed
before secretly. And because that all the world knows that Marten Luther
sleyeth no man but kylleth only with the spiritual sword the word of God
soch cancred consciences as Rochester has Nether persecuteth / but sofereth
percecucion: yet Rochester with a goodly argument proves yt he would do it if
he cowlde. And mark I pray you what an Oratoure he is and how vehemently he
persuadeth it. Rochester is an Oratoure
Marten Luther has burned the Popes decretals: a manifest sign / says he /
that he would have brunte ye Popes holiness also / if he had had him. A like
argument (which I suppose to be rather true) I make* Rochester and his holy
brethern have brunt Christ's testame^te: an evident sign verily that they would
have brunte Christ himself also if they had had him.

I had almost verily left out the chefest point of all. Rochester is clean
beside him self
Rochester both abominable and shameless: ye and sterke mad of pure malice /
and so adased in ye brains / of spite that he ca^ not overcome the troth that
he seith not or rather cares not what he says: in the end of his first
destruction / I would say instruccion as he calls it / intendinge to prove
yt we are justified through holy works / allegeth half a text of Paul of the
fyfte to the Galathiens (as his manner is to iugle and convaye craftily) fides
per dilectionem operans. If Rochester be soch a iuguler: What suppose ye of the
rest* let Rochester be an example therefore to judge them all
Which text he this wise englisheth: faith which is wrought by love / and
makes a verb passive of a verb deponente. Rochester will have love to goo
before and faith to spri^ge out of love. Thus Antichrist turns the rotes of
ye tree upward. I must first love a bitter medicine (after Rochesters doctrine)
and then beleve that it is wholesome. When by natural reason / I first hate a
bitter medicine / until I be brought in belefe of the physician that it is
wholesome and that the bitterness shall heal me / and then afterward love it of
that belefe. Does the child love the father first and then beleve that he is
his son or heir or rather because he knows that he is his son or heir
and beloved / therefore loves again? John says in the thread of his first
Pistle. Faith is the ^ote and love springs of faith.
Se what love the father has showed upon us / that we should be called his
sons. Because we are sons therefore love we. Now by faith are we sons as
John says in the first chapter of his Gospel. He gave them power to be the
sons of God in that they beleved on his name. And Paul says / in the thread
Chapter of his Pistle to the Galathiens / we are all the sons of God by the
faith which is in Jesus Christ. And John in the said chapter of his Pistle
says. Here by perceave we love / that he gave his life for us. We could se no
love ner cause to love again / except that we beleved that he died for us and
that we were saved through his deeth. And in the chapter folowinge says John.
Here in is love: not that we loved God: but that he loved us and sent his
son to make a grement for our sins. Se / God sent not his son for any
love that we had to him: but of the love / that he had to us sent he his son
/ that we might se love and love again. Paul like wise in the.viij. Chapter to
the Romans / after that he has declared the infinite love of God to us ward
in that he spared not his own son but gave him for us / cries out saying:
who shall separat us from the love of God? shall persecucion / shall a sword?
and cet. No / says he / I am sure that no creature shall seperat us from the
love of God that is in Christ Jesus our lord: as who should say / we se so
great love in God to us ward in Christ's deeth / that though all misfortune
should fast on us / we ca^ not but love again. Now how know we yt God loves
us? verily by faith Though Rochester have not the spirit to judge spiritual
things yet ought reason to have kept hi^ from so shamfull lyenge. But God
has bli^ded him to bri^ge there falshed to light
. So therefore / though Rochester be a be faythlesse / yet ought natural
reason to have taught him / that love springs out of faith and knowledge and
not faith and knowledge out of love. But let us se the text. Paul says thus.
In christ Jesus / nether circuncision is any thing worth / ner incircuncision:
but faith which works through love or which through love is strong or myghtie
in workinge and not which is wroughte by love as the iuguler says. Faith that
loves Gods co^maundmentes justifies a man. If thou beleve Gods promises in
Christ and love his co^maundme^tes then art thou saffe. If thou love the
co^maundme^te then art thou sure that thy faith is unfeigned and yt Gods sprite
is in the.

How faith justifies before God in the heart and how love springs of faith
and co^pelleth us to work / and how the works justify before the world and
testify what we are and certify us that our faith is unfeigned and that the
right sprite of God is in us / se in my book of the iustifienge of faith and
there shall thou se all thing abundantly. Also of the The controversy between
James and Paul.
controversy between Paul and James se there. Never the later / when Rochester
says / if faith only justified / then both the devels and also sinners that
lie still in sin should be saved / his argume^te is not worth a straw. For
nether the devels Why devels have none of Paul's faith ner sinners that repent
not
nor yet sinners that continue in sin of purpose and delectacio^ / have any
soch faith as Paul speaks of. For Paul's faith is to beleve Gods promises.
Faith says he To. x. Comes by hearing and hearing comes by the word of
God. And how shall they hear without a preacher / and how shall they preach
except they be sent? As it is written (says he) how bewtifull are the fete
that bring glad tydinges of peace and bring glad tydinges of good things.
Now when sent God any messingers unto the devels to preach them peace or any
good thing: The devell has no promise: he is therefore excluded from Paul's
faith A man may beleve that christ died and many other things and not beleve
in christ.

What it is to beleve in christ.


The devell beleveth that christ died / but not that he died for his sins.
Nether does any that consents in the heart to continue in sin / beleve
that Christ died for hi^ For to beleve that christ died for us / is to se our
horrible damnacion and how we were appointed unto eternal pains and to feale
and to be sure that we are delyvered therfrom through Christ in that we have
power to hate our sins and to love Gods co^mau^dme^tes. All soch repe^te and
have their hertes loosed out of captivite and bondage of sin and are therefore
justified through faith in christ. Weked sinners have no faith but imagincions
and opinions about Christ as our scole men have in their principles / about
which they brawle so fast one with a another. It is a another thing to beleve
that the king is rich and that he is rich unto me / and that my part is
therein: and that he will not spare a penny of his riches at my need / when I
beleve that the king is rich I am not moved. But when I beleve that he is rich
for me and that he will never fail me at my need / then love I and of love am
ready to work unto the vttemost of my power* But let us return at the last
unto our purpose again.

WHat is the cause that lay me^ can not now rule / as well as in times paste /
and as the turks yet do? Why lay me^ can not rule.
Verily because that Antychriste with the miste of his iugulinge has begyled
our eyes and has cast a supersticious fear upon the w^^lde of christen men /
and has taught them to dread / not God and his word / but him self and his
word: not Gods law and ordinances / princes and officers which God has set
to rule the world / but his own law and ordinances / tradicions and
ceremonies and disgised disciples / which he has set every where to deceave
the world and to expel the light of Gods word / that his darkness may have
rowme. For we se by daily experience of certain hundred years long / that he
which fears nether God ner his word / nether regards father / mother /
master / or Christ him self / which rebelleth agenst Gods ordinances /
ryseth agenste the kings and resists his officers / Men fear the Popes oil
moare the^ Gods co^maundmente.
dare not once lay hands on one of the Popes anointed: no though he sley his
father before his face or do violence unto his brother or defile his sister /
wife or mother. Like honor geve we unto his tradicions and ceremonies. What
deuocio^ have we when we are blessed (as they call it) with the chalice / or
when the Bisshope lyfteth up his holy hand over us? Who dare handle the
chalice / twiche the altar ston or putt his hand in the founte or his finger
unto the holy oil? What reverence geve we unto holy water / holy fire / holy
bred / holy salt / hallowed belles / holy wayx / holy bows / holy candels and
holy ashes? And last of all unto the holy candle committ we our souls at
our last departinge. Ye and of the very cloute which the Bisshope or his
chapplen that sto^deth by / knitteth about childerns necks at co^firmacio^ /
what lay person durst be so bold as to vnlouse ye knotte? Thou will say do
not soch things bring ye holy ghost and put away sin and d^yve away
sprites I say that a steadfast faith or belefe in Christ and in the promises
yt God has sworn to geve us for his sake / brings ye holy ghost as all the
scrptures make mention / and as Paul says (Acts. xix.) have ye received the
holy ghost through faith or belevinge? faith is the rock where on Christ
byldeth his congregation / against which says Christ Mathei. xvj. hell gates
shall not prevayle. Faith dryveth the devels a way.
As soon as thou belevest in Christ / the holy ghost comes / sin falls a
way and devels fle: when we cast holy water at ye devell or Why do not the
bisshopes make him fle from shotynge of gunnes
ringe ye belles / he flees / as me^ do from you^ge childern / and moketh
with us / to bri^ge us from the true faith that is in Gods word unto a
supersticious and a false belefe of our own imaginacion. If thou had
faith and threwest an unhallowed ston at his head / he would ernestly fle and
without mockinge / ye though thou threwest no thing at all / he would not yet
abide.

Ceremonies did not the miracle but faith.
Though that at the beginning miracles were showed through soch ceremonies to
move the infidels to beleve the word of God. As thou read how the Apostles
anointed the sick with oil and healed them / and Paul sent his perteler or
gyrkyn to the sick and healed them also. Yet was it not the ceremony that did
the miracle / but faith of the preacher and the troth of God which had
promised to confirm and stablysh his Gospel with soch miracles. Therefore as soon as the gift of miracles ceased / ought the ceremony to have ceased also:
or else if they will neades have a ceremony to signify some promise or benefit
of God (which I praise not but would have Gods word preached every so^day /
for which entente sondayes and holy days were ordained) then let them tell
the people what it means: Let them tell what the ceremony means
and not set up a baulde and a naked ceremony without significacio^ / to make
the people beleve therein and to quench the faith that ought to be geven unto
the word of God.

What helps it also that the pressed when he goes to mass disgiseth him self
with a great part of the passion of Christ and pleyeth out the rest under
silence with signs and profers / with noddinge / beckinge and mowinge / as it
were Jack a napes / when nether he him self nether any man else woteth what
he means? The pressed disgyseth hi^ self with the passion of christ
not at all verily / but hurts and that exceadinghly. For as much as it not
only destroys the Domme ceremonies quench faith and love and make the
infidels to mock us.

The prophecy of Christ is fullfilled
All this comes to pass to fulfill the prophesy which Christ prophesyed.
Mark. xiij And Luke. xxj. that there shall come in his name which shall say
that they them selves are Christ. That do verily the Pope and our holy
orders of relygio^. For they under the name of Christ preach them selves their
own word and their own traditions / and teach the people to beleve in them.
The pope geveth pardons of his full power / of the treasure of the chirch and
of the merits of saints. The freres like wise make their benefactours (which
only they call their brethern and sisters) partakers of their masses /
fasting / watchinges / prayenges and wolwarde goinges / The testament of the
observauntes.
Ye and when a novice of the observauntes is professed the father a^eth him /
will ye keep these ruels of holy saint Frances? and he says ye: will ye so
in dead says he? the other answareth: ye forsooth father. Then faith the
father / and I promise you again everlastinge life. O blasphemy. If eternal
life be due unto the pilde traditions of lousy freres / where is the
testamente become that God made unto us in Christ's blood? Christ says Math.
xxiiij. And Mark. xiij. that there shall come pseudo christi. Falls anointed
Which though I / for a consideration have translated false christ's kepinge
the greek word: yet signifies it in the englysh false anointed and ought so
to be translated There shall come (says Christ) false anointed and false
prophet^s and shall do miracles and wonders / so greatly that / if it were
possible / the very elect or chosen should be brought out of the way. Compare
the Popes doctrine unto the word of God and thou shall find that there has
been and yet is a great goinge out of the way / and that evyll men and
deceavers (as Paul prophesied.ij. Timothei. iij.) have prevayled and waxed
worse and worse / begylinge other as they are bygyld them selves. Thou
tre^blest and quakest saying: shall God let us goo so sore out of the right
way? Christis prophesy: be it never so tereble must be yet fulfilled
I answer it is Christ that warns us / which as he knew all that should
follow / so prophesied he before and is a true prophet / and his prophecy
must neadis be fulfilled.

GOd anointed his son Ihesus with the holy ghost / and therefore called him
Christ / which is as much to say as anointed. Outwardly he disgysed him not
but made him like oder men and sent him in to the world to bless us and to
offer hi^ self for us a Christ was another shave^ nor shorn nor anointed with
oil
sacrifice of a sweet saver / to kill the ste^ch of our sins / that God
he^ceforth should smell them no moare / ner think on them any moare: and to
make full and sufficient satisfaction or amends for all the^ that repent /
belevinge the truth of God and submittinge them selves unto his ordinances
both for they sin yt they do / have done and shall do. For sin we through
fragilite never so often / yet as soon as we repe^te and come in to the right
way again and unto the testamente which God has made in Christ's blood /
our sins vanesh away as smoke in the wind and as darkness at the coming of
light or as thou cast a little blood or milk in to the main see. He that does
ought to make satisfaction or to get heven has lost his part of christis
blood
In so much that whosoever goes about to make satisfaction for his sins to
God ward / saying in his heart / this much have I sinned this much will I do
again / or this wise will I lyve to make ame^des with all or this will I do
to get heven with all the same is an infidele / faythlesse and damned in his
deed doing / and has lost his part in Christ's blood: because he is
disobedient unto Gods testamente / and sets up a another of his own
imaginacion / unto which he will compel God to obey. If we love God we have a
commandment to love our neyboure also / as says John in his Pistle. And if
we have offended him to make him amends / To our neyboure make we amends?
or if we have not where with / to axe him forgevenesse / and to do and sofr^
all things for his sake / to win him to God and to norysh peace and unity:
but to Godward Christ is an everlastinge satisfaction and ever sufficient.

Christ when he had fullfilled his course / The Apostles were another shaven
nor shore^ nor onoynted with oil.
anointed his Apostles and disciples with the same sprite and sent the^ forth
without all manner disgysinge like other me^ also / to preach the attonme^te and
peace which Christ had made between God and man. The Apostles likewise
disgysed no man / but chose men anointed with the same spirit: one to preach
the word of God / whom we call after the greek tongue a Bisshope: an oversear
bisshope or a pressed / that is / in english / an overseer and an elder. How he
was anointed thou read j. Timothe. iij. The true annoyntyng of a pressed
A Bisshope or an oversear must be fautlesse / the husband of one wife (Many
Jews and also gentyls that were converted unto to the faith had at that time
diverse wyves / yet were not compelled to putt any of them away which Paul
because of ensample would not have preachers for as much as in Christ we
return again unto the first ordinance of God / that one man and one woman
should goo to gether) he must be sobyr / of honest behavoure honestly appareld
/ herberous (that is / ready to lodge strangers / apt to teach / no dro^kerde
/ no This oil is not among our bisshopes.
fyghter / not geven to fylthy lucre: but gentle / abhorringe fyghtinge /
abhorringe covetousnes and one that rules his own howsholde honestly /
havinge childern under obedience with all honest. For if a man can not rule
his own house / how can he care for the congregation of God? he may not be
young in the faith or as a man would say an novice / lest he swell and faull
in to the judgment of the evyll speaker / that is / he may not be unlearned
in the secrets of the faith. For soch are attonce stoburne and hedstronge and
set not a little by them selves. But alas / we have above twenty thousand that
know no moare scripture then is written in their por^oues and among them is he
exceadinge well learned that can turn to his service. He must be well reaported
of them that are without / lest he fall in to rebuke and in to the snare of the
evil speaker / that is / lest the infideles which yet beleve not should be
hurt by hi^ and dreven from the faith / if a man that were defamed were made
head and overser of the congregation.

He must have a wife for.ij. causes. one / that it may thereby be known who is
mete for the rowme. Prestes ought to have wives and why
He is unapt for so chargeable an office which had never household to rule. A
another cause is / that chastity is an exceadinge seldom gift / and vnchastyte
exceadinge perelous for that degree. In as much as the people look as well unto
the lyvinge as unto the preachinge / and are hurt at once if the lyvinge
disagre / and fall from the faith and beleve not the word.

This oversear because he was taken from his own busynes and labor / to
preach Gods word unto the paresh / has right by the auctorite of his office /
to calenge an honest lyvinge of the paresh / as thou may se in the
Evangelistes and also in Paul. What the prestes duty is to do: and what to have
For who will have a servaunte and will not geve him meat / drink and
raymente and all things necessary? How Me^ are not bound to pay the pressed in
tithes: by gods law.
they would pay him / whether in money or assign him so much rent or in
tithes / as the gyse is now in many co^trayes / was at their liberty.

Like wise in every co^gregacio^ chose they a another after the same ensample
and eve^ so anointed / as it is to se in the said chapter of Paul and Act. vj.
Dyaco^ what it signifies and what is his office.
Who^ after ye greek word we call deaco^ / yt is to say in english / a
servau^te or a minister whose office was to help and assiste ye pressed and to
gather up his du^ie and to gather for ye pore of ye paresh / which were
destitute of fre^des and could not work / co^me^ bedgers to run from door
to door / were not the^ sofered. No bedgers
On ye saints days namely soch as had sofered deeth. How holy days and
offerynges came up.
For ye word sake came men to gether in to the church / and the prist preached
unto them and exhorted the^ to cleave fast unto the word and to be strong in
the faith and to fight agenst the powers of the world / with soferi^ge for
their faythes sake after the ensample of ye saints Saints were not yet gods.
. And taught them not to beleve in the saints and to trust in their merits
and to make Gods of them: but took the saints for an example only and prayed
God to geve them like faith and trust in his word and like strength and power
to sofre therefore and to geve them so sure hope of the life to come / as thou
may se in the collects of saint Laurence and of saint Steven in our lady
mate^s. And in soch days / as we now offer / so gave they every man his
portion acordinge to his abylite and as God put in his heart / to the
mayntenaunce of the pressed deakon and other comune ministers and of the pore and
to find learned men to teach / and so forth. And all was putt in the hands of
the deacon / as thou may se in the life of saint Laurence and in the
histories Why lands were geven unto the spiritual officers before we fell
from the faith.
And for soch purposes gave men lands afterward to ease the pareshes and made
hospitals and also places to teach their childern and to bring them up and
to nurtoure them in Gods word / which lands our monks now devour.

Antichrist.
ANtychrist of a another manner has sent forth his disciples those false
anointed of which Christ warns us before that they should come and show
miracles False anointed
and wonders / even to bring the very elect out of the way / if it were
possible. Shavinge (...) borrowed of the hethe^. and oyli^ge of the Jews.
He anoynteth them after the manner of the Jews and shaveth them and shoreth
the^ after the manner of ye hethen prestes which served the ydoles. He sends
them forth not with false oil only / but with false False names
names also. For compare their names unto their deades and thou shall find
them false. He sends them forth as Paul prophesied of them.ij. Thessalonien.
ij. with lyenge signs and wonders. Lyenge signs.
What sign is the anoyntinge? that they be full of the holy ghost. Compare
them to the signs of the holy ghost which Paul rekeneth / and thou shall find
it a false sign. A Bisshope must be fautelesse / the husband of one wife. No
wife but an whore
Nay says the Pope / the husband of no wife / but the holder of as many
whores as he lists. God commands all degres / if they burn and can not
lyve chaste / to mary. The Pope says if thou burn take a Take a dispe^sation^.
dispensacion for a concubine and put her away / when thou art old / or else
as our lawears say / sinon cast tamen Knaveate
caute / that is / if ye live not chaste / se ye carry clean and play the knave
secretly. Herberous / ye to whores and baudes / for a poor man shall as sone
break his neck as his fast with them / but of the scrappes and with the
dogs / when diner is done. Apt to teach and as Peter says.j. Pe. ij. ready
all ways to geve an a^swere to every man yt axeth you a reason of the hope yt
ye have and that with mekenes. Which thing is signified by ye botes which
doctors of divinite are created in / Botes
because they should be ready all ways to goo through thick and thynne / to
preach Gods word / and by the Bisshopes two horned myter / which betokens
the absolute and perfect knowleage yt they ought to have in the new
testame^te and the old. Miters.
Be not these false signs? For they beat only and teach not. Ye says ye Pope
if they will not be ruled Cite them
cite them to appear and Pose them
pose them sharply / what ye hold of ye Popes power / of his pardons / of his
bulls / of purgatory / of the ceremonies / of confession and soch like
creatures of our most holy fathers. If they miss in any poi^te / Make them
heretics
make heretics of the^ and burn the^. If they be of mine annoi^ted and bear
my mark disgresse the^ / I would say disgraduate the^ and (after ye example of
noble Antiochus ij. Match. vij.) pare ye crounes and the fingers of the^ and
torme^te the^ craftily and for very pain make them deny the truth. Burn them
But now say our Bisshopes / because the truth is come to far abroad and
the lay people begin to smell our wiles / it is best to oppress them with
craft secretly and tame them in prison: Ye let us find the means to have
them in the kings prison and to make treason of soch doctrine: Ye we must
stere up some war one where or a another to bring the people in to a another
imaginacion. If they be gentle men abjure them secretly.

Curse them.iiij. times in they year. Curse them* Fear them
Make them a frayde of every thing and namely to twich mine anointed / and
make them to fear the sentence of the church / suspencions / excomunicacions
and curses. Be the right or wrong / bear them in hand that they are to be
feared yet. Preach me and mine auctorite / and how terreble a thing my curse
is / and how black it makes their souls. On the holidays which were ordened
to preach Gods word / set up long ceremonies / long matenses / long
masses and long even songs / and all in All in latin^
laten that they understand not / and Roll them
roll them in darkness / that ye may led the^ who there ye woll. And lest
soch things should be to tediouse / Singe
sing some / say some pype some / ringe ye belles and King
lulle the^ and rock the^ a sleep. Lolle them
And yet Paul (j. Corint. xiiij. forbids to speak in the chirch or
congregation save in ye tongue yt all understood. Rock them a stepe.
For ye lay man thereby is not edefied or taught. How shall ye lay man say
ame^ (says Paul) to thy blessinge or thanks gevi^ge / when he woteth not what
thou say? He wotteth not wether thou bless or curse

Pray in late^.
What then says the Pope / what care I for Paul. I command by the virtue of
obedience to read the Gospel in latyne. Say them a Gospel.
Let the^ not pray but in latyne no / not there pater noster. If any be sick
/ goo also and say them a Gospel and all in latyne: ye to the very corn and
fruits of the field in the procession weke / preach the Gospel in latyne. Make
the people beleve / that it shall grow the better. It is verily as good to
preach it to swyne as to men / if thou preach it in a tongue they understand
not. How shall I prepare my self to Gods commaundmentes? How shall I be
thankful to Christ for his kyndnes? How shall I beleve the truth and
promyses which God has sworn / while thou tellest them unto me in a tongue
which I understand not? What then says my lord of Caunterbury to a pressed
that would have had the new testame^te gone forth in english. What q^od my
lord of caunterbury
What (says he) would thou that the lay people should wete what we do?

No fyghter / which I suppose is signified by the cross that is borne before
the hie prelates and borne before them in procession. Cross.
Is that also not a false sign? What realm can be in Turmoylars
peace for soch turmoylars? What so little a paresh is it / but they will pick
one quarrel or a another with them other / for some syrples / cresome or
mortuary / other for one tryfle or other / and cite them to the arches?
Trayters they are to all creatures and have a secret conspiracion between the^
selves. One craft they have / to make many kingdoms and small / and to norysh
old tytles or quarells that they may ever move the^ to war at their
pleasure. The craft of the prelates.
And if much lands by any chance / fall to one man / ever to cast ^ bone in
the way / that he shall never be able to obtain it / as we now se in the
Emperor. Why? For as long as the kings be small / if God would open the
eyes of any to set a reformacion in his realm / the^ should the Pope Interdite.
interdicte his land / and send in other princes to conquer it.

Not geven to fylthy lucre / but abhorringe covetousnes. And as Peter says.j.
Petri. v. Taking the oversight of them / not as though ye were compelled there
unto: but willingly. Not for desire of fylthy lucre but of a good mind: not as
though ye were lords over the paryshes (over the paryshes quoth he) O Peter
Peter thou wast to long a fysher / thou wast never brought up at the arches
/ nether wast master of the Rolls / ner yet chaunceler of England. Peter went
never to scole at the arches.
They are not content to raygne over king and Emperor and the hole earth: but
cale^ge auctorite also in heve^ and in hell. It is not enough for them to raygne
over all that are quycke / but have created them a purgatory / to raygne also
over the deed and to have one kingdom moare then God him self has. The Pope
has one ki^gdome moare then god him self
But that ye be an ensample to ye flock (says peter) And when ye chief
sheparde shall appear ye shall receave an incorruptible croune of glory This
abhorri^ge of covetousnes is signified as I suppose by shavinge and Sheringe
what it signifies
sheringe of the hear / that they have no superfluite. But is not this also a
false sign? ye verily it is to them a remembrance to shere and shave / to
hepe benefice upon benfice / promocion upon promocion / dignite upon dignite /
bisshopricke apo^ bisshopricke / with pluralities / unions and tot quots.

Tot quo^
First by the auctorite of the Gospel / they that preach the word of God in
every paresh and other necessary ministres / have right to cale^ge an honest
lyvinge like unto one of the brethern / and there with ought to be content
Bisshopes that preach not.
Bisshopes and prestes that preach not or that preach ought save Gods word /
are none of Christ's nor of his anoyntinge: but servauntes of the beast whose
mark they bear / whose word they preach whose law they mayntene clean
against gods law / and with their false sophistry geve him greater power then
God ever gave to his son Christ.

But they as insatiable beestes not unmindful why they were shaven and shoren
/ because they will stand at no man's grace or be in any man's danger / have
gotten in to their own hands / first the Tithes
tithe or tenth of all the realm. Then I suppose with in a little or all to
gether the third foot of all the Temporal lands
temporal lands.

Mark well how many personages or vicariages ar there in the Realm which at
the lest have a plowe land a piece. Then note the lands of Bisshopes / Abbotes
/ Pryors / Nuns / knights of saint John's / Cathedral chyrches / Coleges /
Chauntryes and Frechapels. Frechapell
For though the house fall in decay and the ordinance of the founder belost /
yet will not they loose the lands. What comes once in / may never moare out.
They make a frechapell of it / so that he which enjoys it shall do naught
therefore. Besides all this / how many chaplaynes do gentlemen find at their
own cost in their houses. How many sing for souls by testamentes. Then the
provinge of Testamentes
testamentes / the presinge of goods the Bisshope of Caunterburyes
prerogatyve. Is that not much through the Realm in a year? Four Offeringe
days Prevey tithes.
offeringe days and prevey tithes. There is no servaunte / but that he shall
pay some what of his wages. None shall receave the body of Christ at Ester /
be he never so pore a bedger or never so you^ge a lad or maid / but they must
pay some what for it. Then Mortuaries
mortuaryes for forgote^ tithes (as they say) And yet what parsone or vicare is
there that will forgete to have a pygyn house to pecke up somewhat both at
sowi^ge time and at hervest when corn is ripe. They will forgette no thing.
No man shall dye in their dett / or if any man do / he shall pay it when he
is deed. They will loose no thing. Why? It is Gods / it is not there is. It is
sent Cudbertes rentes / sent Alba^s lands / sent Edmonds right / sent Peter's
patrimonye say they / and none of ours. If ye dye from home.
Item if a man dye in a another man's paresh / bysides yt he must pay at home a
mortuary for forgoten tithes / he must there Thou must pay ye^ thou pass.
pay also the best that he there has. Wether it be an horse of twenty pound
or how good so ever he be / either a cheyne of gold of an hundret mark or fyve
hundret pound / if it so chance. It is much verily for so little pain taking
in confession and in ministringe the sacraments. Then Pery pillage
beedrolles. Item chrisome / chyrchinges / banes / weddinges / offeringe at
weddinges / offeringe at buryenges / offeringe to images / offeringe of wax
and lyghtes which come to their vauntage / besides the supersticious wast of
wax in torches and tapers through out the land. Then brotherhedes and
perdoners. What get they also by confessions? Confession
Ye and many enjoin penance to geve a certain for to have so many masses
said / and desire to provide a chappellayne them selves. Soul masses diriges /
monethmyndes / years minds / al soul day and tre^tals. The mother church and
ye hie altar must have some what in every testame^te. Offeri^ges at prestes
first masses. First mass. Professinges Coniu^atio^s
Ite^ no man is professed / of what so ever religion it be / but he must bring
so^me what. The halowinge or rather coniuringe of chirches / chapels / altares
/ superaltares / chalice vestimentes and belles. Then book / bell /
candelsticke / organes / chalice / vestimentes copes / altar clothes /
syrpleses: towels basens / euars / sheep / senser and all manner ornaments must
be found them freely / they will not geve a myte there unto. Person Uicare
Parish pressed Freres
Last of all what swarms of bedginge freres are there The person shereth the
vicare shaveth / the perish pressed polleth / the friar scrapeth and the perdoner
pareth we lack but a bocher to pole of the skin.

What get they in their Spiritual law
spiritual law (as they call it) in a year / at the arches and in every dioses?
what get the Commissaries and officials with their somners and apparetars by
bawdery in a year? A prepre co^mod^^e of confession.
Shall ye not find curates ynowe which to flatter the co^messaries and
officials with all that they may goo quite them selves shall open unto them
the co^fessio^s of the richest of their pareshes. Whom they cite prively and
lay to their charges secretly. If they desire to know their accusers / nay
say they / the matter is known well enough and to moare then ye are ware of.
Lay your hand one the book
Come lay your hand on the book / if ye forswere your self / we shall
bring proves / we will handle you / we will make an ensample of you. Oh hoe
terreble are they? Come and swear (say they) that ye will be obedie^te unto our
iniunctio^s And by that craft wringe they their purses and make them drop as
long as there is a penny in them. In three or four years shall they in those
offices get enough to pay for a bisshopes bulls. What other thing are these
in a realm save horsleches and eve^ very magottes cancres and caterpillars /
which devour no moare but all that is grene and those wolves which Paul
prophesied should come and should not spare the flock Acts. xx. chapter. And
which Christ said should come in lambs skynnes and bade us beware of them and
judge the^ by their works.

No man may avenge save the king and he is bound by his office.
THough as I before have sufficiently proved / a christen man must sofre all
thing / be it never so great unright / as long as it is not agenst Gods
commaundme^te / nether is it lawful for him to cast any burden of his back
by his own auctorite till God pull it of which laid it on for our deservinges
/ yet ought the kings every where to defend their realms from soch
oppression / if they were christen / which is seldom seen and is an hard thing
verily / though not impossible. For alas they be Kings are in captivite.
captyves or ever they be kings / ye all most yer they be borne. No man may
be sofered about them but flatterers and soch as are first sworn true unto
our most holy fathers the Bisshopes that is to say false to God and man.

If any of the nobles of the realm be true to the king and so bold that he
dare council him that which should be to his honor and for the wealth of the
realm. They will wait a season for him (as men say) They will provide a
goostly father for him. God bring their wekednes to light There is no
mischeve where of they are not the rote / ner blood shed / but through their
cause other by there counsel or in that they preach not true obedience and
teach not the people to fear God. If any faithful servaunte be in all the
court / he shall have twenty spies waytinge upon him / he shall be cast out of
the court / or (as the saying is) co^veyed to Callyce / and made a captain /
or an ambassadoure / he shall be kept far enough from the kings presens. The
duty of kings.


The kings ought Isaye to remember yt they are in Gods stead and ordened of
God not for them selves / but for the wealth of their subjects. Let them
remember that their subjects are their brethern / their flesh and blood /
members of their own body and even their awn selves in Christ. Therefore ought
they to pytie them and to ryd the^ from soch wyly tyrany which increases moare
and moare daily. And though that the kings by the falshed of the Bisshopes and
Abbottes be sworn to defend soch lyberties: yet ought they not to keep their
Unlawful oaths ought to be broken and may with out dispensation
oaths / but to break them. For as much as they are unright and clean agenst
Gods ordinance / and even but cruel oppression / contrary unto brotherly love
and charity. Unlawful oaths ought to be broken and may with out dispensation
Moare over the spiritual officer ought to punesh no sin / but and if any
sin break out the king is ordened to punesh it and they not: but to preach
and exorte them to fear God and that they sin not.

And let the kings put down some of their tyrany / and turn some unto a
comenwelth. If the tenth part of soch tyrany were geven the king yearly and
leyd up in the shyre tounes agenst the realm had neade / what would it grow
to in certain years? Moare over one king / one law / is Gods ordinance in
every realm. The king only ought to punesh sin I mean that is broken
forth the heart must remain to God.
Therefore ought not the king / to suffer them to have a severell law by them
selves and to draw his subeictes thither. Hit is not mete / will they say
that a The sprite perteyneth unto the shaven only.
spiritual man should be judged of a worldly or a temporal man. The sprite
perteyneth unto the shaven only.
O abomination: se how they divide and separate them selves? If the lay man be
of ye world / so is he not of God. If he beleve in Christ / then is he a
membre of Christ / Christ's brother / Christ's flesh / Christ's blood /
Christ's spouse / coheyre with Christ and has his sprite in erneste and is
also spiritual. If they would rob us of the sprite of God / why should they
fear to rob us of worldly goods? Be cause thou art put in office to preach
Gods word / art thou therefore no moare one of thy brethern? is the Mayre of
London no moare one of the Cite / because he is the chief officer? Is the king
no moare of the realm because he is heed there of. The kings law is Gods law.
The king is in the rowme of God / and his law is Gods law and no thing but
the law of nature and natural equite which God graved in the hertes of men.
Yet Antichriste is to good to be judged by the law of God he must have a new
of his own making It were mete verily that they went to no law at all. No
moare neaded they / if the would study to preach Gods word truly and be
content with sufficient and to be like one of their brethern.

If any question arose about the fath or of the scripture / that let them
judge by the manifest and open scriptures / not excludinge the lay men. How
me^ ought to judge questions of the scripture
For there are many found among the lay men which are as wise as the
officers. Or else when the officer dies / how could we put a another in the
rowme? Will thou so teach.xx.xxx.xl. or fyfty years / that no man shall have
knowledge or judgment in Gods word save thou only? We come often to scole. But
are never taught.
Is it not a shame that we Christen come so often to church in vain / when he of
four score years old knows no moare then he that was borne yesterdaye.

Kings ought to se what they do and not to beleve the bisshopes namely
saying their lyvi^ge is so sore suspecte
Moare over when the spiritual officers have excommunicate any man or have
condemned any opinion for heresy: Let not the king nor temperall officers
punesh and sley by and by at their commaundment. But let them look on Gods
word / and compare their judgment unto the scripture and se whether it be
right or no / and not beleve them at the first choppe / what so ever they say
namely in things that parteyne unto their own auctorites and power. For no
man is a right judge in his own cause. It perteyneth unto all men to know the
scriptures
Why does christ command the scripture to be preached unto all creatures /
but that it perteyneth unto all men to know them? Christ refers him self
unto the scriptures John v. And in the.xj. Chapter of Matthew / unto the
question of John Baptistes disciples he answered. The blind se / the lepers
are cle^sed / the deed arise again etc. meaning that if I do the works
which are prophesied that Christ should do when he comes / why dowte ye
whether I be he or no as who should say / axe the scripture whether I be Christ
or no and not my self. How happens it then that our prelates will not come
to the light also that we may se whether their works be wrought in God or no?
Why fear they to let the lay men se what they do? Why make they all their
examinacions in darkness?
Why examine they not their causes of heresye openly / as the lay men do
their fellons and mortherars? Wherefore did Christ and his Apostles also warn
us so diligently of Antychriste and of false Prophets that should come?
Because that we should slomber or sleep careless ^ or rather that we should
look in the light of the scripture with all diligens to spy them when they
came / and not to sofre our selves to be disceaved and led out of the way?
John bids judge the spirits. Whereby shall we judge them but by the
scripture? How shallt thou know / whether the Prophet be true or false or
whether he speak gods word or of his own heed if thou will not se the
scriptures? Why said David in the second psalm be learned ye that judge the
earth lest the lord be angry with you and ye pereshe from the right way? Be
learned ye that judge the earth:


A terrible warninge verily: ye and look on the stories well and thou shall
find verey few kings sens the beginning of the world that have not pereshed
from the right way / and that because they would not be learned.

The Emperor and kings are no thing now a days but even hangmen unto the
Pope and Bisshopes / to kill whosoever they condemn / with out any moare a do
/ as Pilate was unto the scribes and pharisees and the hie Bisshopes / to hang
Christ. The kings are become Antichrists hangemen.
For as those prelates answered Pilate (when he axed what he had done) if he
were not an evyll doer we would not have brought him unto the. As who should
say / we are to holy to do any thing amiss / thou may beleve us well
enough: ye and his blood on our heedes / said they / kill hi^ hardly / we
will bear the charge / our souls for thine: we have also a law by which he
ought to dye / for he calls him self Gods sone. Even so say our prelates /
he ought to dye by our laws / he speaks agenst the church. And your grace
is sworn to defend the lyberties and ordinances of the church and to
mayntene our most holy fathers auctorite (...) souls for youres / ye shall
do a meritorious dead therein. Never thelesse as Pilate escaped not the
iudgeme^te of God / even so is it to be feared lest our temperall powers shall

be learned ye ye judge the earth lest ye lord be angry with you and ye peresh

Who slew ye prophets? Who slew Christ? Who slew his Apostles? Who slew the
prophe^e^
Who the marters and all the ryghteous that ever were slayen? The kings and
the temperall sword at the request of the false prophets. They deserved soch
morther to do and to have their part with the ypocrites because they would
not be learned and se the troth them selves. Why were the prophets slain.
Wherefore sofered the prophets? because they rebuked the ypocrites which
begyled the world and namely princes and rulers and taught them to put their
trust in things of vanite and not in Gods word What deades of mercy teach the
ypocrites
. And taught them to do soch deades of mercy as were profitable unto no man
but unto the false prophets them selves only / making marchaundyse of Gods
word. Why slew they christ.
wherefore slew they Christ? even for rebukynge the ypocrytes: because he said
/ woe be to you scribes and pharisees ypocrites / for ye shut up the kingdom of
heven before me^ Math. xxiij. yt is / as it is written Luke. xj. ye have taken

the promyses which are the keys where with men lowse have our ypocrites also

Be learned therefore ye that judge ye world lest God be angry with you and ye

devour wedowes howses under a color of long prayar. Our ypocrites rob not
the wedowes only: but knight / squire / lord duke king and Emperor and even
ye whole world under the same color: teachinge the people to trust in their
prayars and not in Christ for whose sake God has forgeven all ye sin of the
whole world / unto as many as repent and beleve. They be not a lit^e afraid
of purgatory that make pe^petuities
They fear the^ with purgatory and promise to pray perpetually / lest the
lands should ever return home again unto the right heirs. What have thou
bought with robbinge thy heirs or with gevinge the ypocrites that which thou
robest of other men? Perpetual prayar? Ye perpetual pain. For they appoynte
the no time of deliveraunce / their prayars are so myghtie. The Pope for money
can empty purgatory when he will It is verily purgatory. Why it is called
purgatory.
For it purges and makes clean riddau^ce: ye it is hell. For it devoureth
all things. His fatherhode sends the^ to heve^ with Scala celi
scala celi: yt is / with a ladder / to scale ye walls. The door is stopte: up

For by the door christ / will they not let the^ come in. That do^re have they

for and prayed to also.
For some they pray daily which gave them perpetuites and yet make saints of

Moses takes record of God that he took not of any of the people so much as
an ass / nether vexed any of them. Prayar was not sold in the old time
Numeri. xvj Samuel in the first book of kings the.xij. chapter / axed all
Israel whether he had taken any man's ^xe or ass or had vexed any man or had
taken any gift or reward of any man. And all the people testified nay / yet
these two both taught the people and also prayed for them as much as our
prelates do. Peter. j. Petri. v. exhortes the elders to take the oversight of
Christ's flock not for fylthy lucre: but of a goodwill even for l^ve. Paul
Act. xx. takes the prestes or elders to record / that he had taught
repe^tau^ce and faith and all the council of God. And yet had desired no man's
gold / silver / or vesture: but feed him self with the labor of his hands.
And yet these two taught and prayed for the people as much as our prelates do
/ with whom it goes after the common saying / no penny no Pater noster. Which
prelates yet as ye teach not but bea^^ only so wott they not what prayer
means.

Moareover the law of love which Christ left among us / is to geve and not
to receave. What prayar is it then that thus robs all the world contrary to
that great co^maundmente which is the end of all commaundmentes and in which
all other are contained. Their prayar breaks the great co^maundme^t of God.
It is time that hit were tied up therefore.
If men should continue to bye prayer four or fyve hundred years moo / as they
have done / there would not be a foot of ground in Christendom nether any
worldly thing which they that will be called spiritual only should not
possess. And thus all should be called spiritual.

Woe be to you lawyers / for ye lade men with burde^s which they are not able to
bear / and ye your selves ^owch not the packes with one of your fyngers
says Christ Luke. xj. Our The burde^s of our spiritual lawyers
lawyers verily have lade^ us a thousand times moare. What spiritual kynred
have they made in bapti^ / to let matrimony / besides that they have added
certain degrees unto the law natural for the same purpose. What an vnbearable
burden of chastity do they violently thrust on other men's backs / and how
easily bear they it them selves? How sore a burden? How cruel an hangman? How
grevous a turme^te? ye and how paynefull an hell is this ear confession unto
men's consciences? Confession turmente^h the conscience: robs the pur^ of
money and the soul of faith
For ye people are brought in belefe / yt without that they ca^ not be saved.
In so much yt some fast certain days in the year and pray certain
supersticious prayers all their lyves long / yt they may not dye without
confession. In perel of deeth / if the pressed be not by / the shippemen shrive
them selves unto the mast. If any be present / they run then every man in to
his care but to Gods promise fle they not: for they know them not. If any man
have a deethes wound / he cries immediately for a pressed. If a man dye without
shrift many take it for a sign of damnacion. Many be reason of that false
belefe dye in desperacion. Many for shame keep back of their confession
xx.xxx. years and think all the while that they be damned. I knew a pore woman
with child which longed / and being overcome^ of her passion / eat flesh on
a fredaye / which thing she durst not confess in the space of xviij. years /
and thought all that while that she had been damned / and yet sinned she not at
all. Is not this a sore burden that so weyeth down the soul unto he botome of
hell? what should I say? A great book were not sufficient to rehearse the
snares which they have leyed to rob men both of their goods and also of the
trust which they should have in Gods word.

The scribes and pharisees do all their works to be seen of men. They set
abroad their philateries and make long borders on their garments and love to
sit uppermost a^ festes and to have the chief seats in the synagoges / that
is in the co^gregacions or councels / and to be called raby / that is to say
masters says Christ Math. xxiij. Behold the deades of our spiritualte / and
how many thousand fascions are among the^ to be known by? Which as none is
like a another so loves none a another. For every one of the^ supposes that all
other poll to fast and make to many captives: yet to resist Christ / are they
al agreed lest they should be all compeld to deliver up there prisoners to him

Behold how they are esteemed / and how hie they be crept up above all / not in

In the^ and their deservinges put we moare trust the^ in Christ and his
merits. To their promyses gyve we moare faith / the^ to the promises which God
has sworn in Christ's blood.

The ypocrites say unto the kings and lords / these heretykes would have us
down first / and then you / to make all comune. Kings are down: they ca^ not
goo lower
Nay ye ypocrites and right heretics approved by open scripture / the kings
and lords are down already / and that so low that they can not goo lower.
Ye tread them under your fete and lead them captive and have made them your
bond servauntes to wait on your fylthy lusts and to avenge your malice on
every man contrary unto the right of Gods word. Ye have not only robbed them
of there land / auctorite / honor and due obedience which ye owe unto them /
but also of there wits / so that they are not with out understanding in Gods
word only but even in worldly matters that pertayne unto their offices / they
are moare then childern. Ye bear the^ in hand what ye will / and have brought
them even in case like unto the^ which when they dance naked in nets /
beleve they are invisible. We would have the^ up again and restored unto the
rowme and auctorite which God has geven the^ / and where of ye have robbed
the^. And your inward falshed we do but utter only with ye light of Gods word
/ that your ypocrisy might be seen. Be learned therefore ye yt judge ye world
lest God be angry with you and ye paresh from ye right way.

Woe be to you scribes and phareses ypocrites. For ye make clean the utter side
of the cup and of the platter / but within they are full of brybry and
excess says Christ. Math. xxiij. Our ypocrites lyve by theft.
Is that which our ypocrites eat and drink and all their riotous excess any
other thing save robbery and that which they have falsely gotten with their
lyinge doctrine? Be learned therefore ye that judge the world and compel them
to make restitucion again.

Ye blind gydes says Christ / ye strain out a gnat and swalow a camel.
Math xxiij. do not our bli^de gydes also sto^ble at a straw and lepe over a

which are not anointed / or say Alleluia instead of Laus tibi domine / or Ite

/ or read the Gospel without light / or make not his crosses a right / how

man's wife / to bye a benefice / to set one Realm at variaunce with a another
and to cause.xx. thousand men to die on a day is but a trifle and a pastime
with them.

As the Jews are the childern of Abraham* so are the bisshopes the successors
of the apostles:
The Jews bostet them selves of Abraham. And Christ said unto them. John. viij
If ye were Abraham's childern ye would do the deades of Abraham. Our ypocrites
bost them selves of the auctorite of Peter and of Paul and the other Apostles /
clean contrary unto the deades and doctrine of Peter / Paul and of all the
other Apostles. Which both obeyed all worldly auctorite and power vsurpinge
none to the^ selves / and taught all other to fear the kings and rulers and
to obey them in all things not contrary to the commandment of God / and not
to resist them / though they took away life and goods wrongefully / but
patiently to abide Gods vengeance. This did our spritualte never yet / ner
taught it. The spiritualte have taught to fear there traditions:
They taught not to fear God in his commaundmentes / but to fear them in
their tradicions. In so much that the evyll people which fear not to resist a
good king and to rise agenst him / dare not lay hondes on one of them /
nether for defylinge of wife daughter or very mother They win some what all
ways
When all men loose life and lands / they remain all ways sure and in safty
/ and ever win some what. For who so ever conquereth other men's lands
unrightfully ever gevis them part with them. To them is all thing lawful *
In all councels and perlamentes are they the chief. Without them may no king
be crouned / nether until he be sworn to their lyberties. All secrets know
they / even the very thoughts of men's hertes. By them all things are
mynistred. No king nor Realm may through their falshed lyve in peace. To
beleve they teach / not in Christ but in them and their disgised ypocrisie.
And of them compel they all men to by redempcio^ and forgevenes of sins. The
peoples sin they cate and there of wax fat. The wekeder the people are /
the moare prosperous is their comune wealth. If kings and great men do
amiss they must bylde abbayes and colleges / mean men bylde chauntres pore
find trentals and broderhedes and bedgynge freres. Their own heirs do men
disheret to endote them. All kings are compelled to submit them selves to
them Read the ^^ory of king John / and of other kings. They will have their
causes avenged / though hoole Realms should therefore parish. Take from them
their desgisinge / so are they not spiritual. Compare that they have taught us
unto the scripture / so are we without faith.

Christ says John. v. chap. how can ye beleve which receave glory one of a
another. They that seek honor have no faith nether can they do Gods message.
If they that seek to be gloriouse / can have no faith then are our prelates
faythlesse verily. And John. vij. he says / he that speaks of him self /
seeks his own glory. If to seek glory and honor be a sure token / that a
man speaks of his own self and does his own message and not his masters:
then is the doctrine of our prelates of them self and not of God. Be learned
therefore ye that judge the earth lest God be angry with you and ye peresh from
the right way.

Be learned
Be learned left the ypocrites bring the wrath of God upon your heedes and
compel you to shede innocente blood: as they have compelled your
predicessours to sley the prophets / to kill Christ and his Apostles and all
the righteous that sens were slain Gods word ought all me^ to know
Gods word pertayneth unto all me^ as it perteyneth unto all servauntes to
know their masters will and pleasure / and to all subjects to know the laws
of their prince Let not the ypocrites do all thing They do all secretly
secretly. What reason is it that mine enemy should put me in prison at his
pleasure and there diet me and handyll me as he lusts / and judge me him
self and that secretly / and condemn me by a law of his own making / and
then deliver me to Pilate to morther me? Let Gods word try every man's
doctrine and whom so ever gods word proves unclean let hi^ be taken for a
leper Gods word ought to judge

The right way to understood the scripture.


One scripture will help to declare a another. And the circu^staunces / that is
to say / the places that goo before and after / will geve light unto the
mydill text. And the open and manifest scriptures will ever improve the false
and wrong exposition of the darker sentences. Let the temporal power to whom
God has geve^ the sword to take vengeance / look or ever that they lepe /
and se what they do. Let the causes be disputed before them / and let him that
is accused have rowme to answer for him self. The kings have a judge before
whom my soul for yours helps not
The powers to whom God has committed the sword shall geve a countes for
every drop of blood that is shed on the earth. Then shall their ignorance not
excuse them nor the saying of the ypocrites help them / my soul for yours /
your grace shall do a meretorious dead / your grace ought not to hear them
it is an old heresy condemned by the church* The king ought to look in the
scripture and se whether it were truly condemned or no / If he will punesh it.
If the king or his officer for hi^ / will flee me so ought ye king or his
officer to judge me. The ki^ge can not / but unto his damnation / lend his
swerd to kill whom he judges not by his own laws. Let hi^ that is accused
sto^d on the one side and the accusar on the other side and let the kings
judge sit and judge the cause / if the king will kill and not be a murtherar
before God.

Here of may ye se / not only that our persecucio^ is for the same cause that
Christ's was and that we say no thing that Christ said not / Preach what
thou will but rebuke not ypocrisy.
but also that all persecucion is only for rebukynge of ypocresy / that is to
say / of ma^s ryghteousnes and of holy deades which man has imagined to
please God and to be saved by / with out Gods word and beside the testamente
that God has made in Christ. If Christ had not rebuked the phareses because
they taught the people beleve in their tradicions and holiness and in offeringes
that came to their vauntage / and that they taught the wydowes and them that
had their friends deed to beleve in their prayers and that through their prayers
the deed should be saved / and through that means robbed them both of their
goods and also of the testamente and promyses that God had made / to all that
repented / in Christ to come / he might have be vncrucified unto this day.

If saint Paul also had not preached agenst circumcision / that it justified
not and that vows / offeringes and ceremonies justified not / and that
righteousness and forgevenes of sins came not by any deservinge of our deades
but by faith or belevinge the promyses of God and by the deservinge and merits
of Christ only / he might have lyved unto this hour. Like wise if we preached
but agenst pride covetousnes / lechery / extorcion / vsary / symony and against
the evell lyvinge both of the spiritualte as well as of the temporalte and
against inclosynges / of parkes / reysinge of re^te and fynes / and of the
carye^ge out of wolle out of the realm / we might endure long ynowe. But
twich the scabbe of ypocresye or popeholynes and goo about to utter their
false doctrine where with they reygne as Gods in the heart and consciences of
men and rob them / not of Lands goods and auctoryte only / but also of the
testamente of God and salvation that is in Christ: then helps the nether
Gods word / ner yet if thou did miracles / but that thou art / not an
heritike only and have the devell with in the / but also a breaker of the
kings peace and a traytar. But let us return unto our lyenge signs again.

WHat signifies that the prelates are so bloody and clothed in redd? The
prelates are clothed in red.
that they be ready every hour to sofre* martyrdom for the testimony of Gods
word. Is that also not a false sign? When no man dare for them ones open his
moth to axe a question of Gods word because they are ready to burn him.

Pollaxes.
What signify the pollaxes that are borne before hye legates a latere? What so
ever false sign they make of them I care not: but of this I am sure / that as
the old ypocrites when they had slain Christ / set pollaxes to keep him in
his sepulcre yt he should not rise again: even so have our ypocrites buried
the testamente that God made unto us in Christ's blood / and to keep it down
/ that it rise not again / is all their study? where of these pollaxes are the
very sign.

Is not that shepardes hoke the Bisshopes crose a false sign? Is not that
white rochett that the Bisshopes and chanons were so like a Nun and so
effeminatly / a false sign? What other things are their sandals / gloves /
myters and all the whole po^pe of their disgisinge / then false signs in which
Paul prophesied that they should come? And as Christ warned us to be ware of
wolves in lambs skynnes and bade us look rather unto their fruits Judge the
(...) by his fruit and not by his lev^^
and deades than to wonder at their disgisinges. R^nne thorout all our holy
religions / and thou shall find the^ like wise all clothed i^ falshed

Of the sacraments.
FOr as much as we be come to signs / we will speak a word or two of the
signs which God has ordened that is to say / of the sacraments which
Christ left amongst us for our comfort / that we may walk in light and in
troth and in fealinge of the power of God. For he that walks in the day
stombleth not / when contrary wise he that walks in the night sto^bleth John.
xj. And they yt walk in darkness wotte not wheder they goo. Ioh. xij.

This word sacrame^te is as much to say as an holy sign / and represents
allwaye some promise of God. Sacraments are signs of gods promises
As in the old testame^te God ordained yt the raynebowe should represent and
signify unto all me^ an oath that God swear to Noe and to all me^ after him /
that he would no more drowned the world through water.

The sacrament of the body and blood of Christ.
SO the sacrament of the body and blood of christ has a promise annexed
which the pressed should declare in the english tongue This is my body yt is
broken for you. This is my blood yt is shed for many unto ye forgevenesse of
sins. This do in remembrance of me says Christ. Luke. xxij. And.j.
Corinth. xj. The promise which the sacrament preaches justifies only.
If when thou seist the sacrament or eatest his body or drinkest his blood /
thou have this promise fast in thine heart (that his body was slain / and his
blood shed for thy sins) and belevest it / so art thou saved and justified
thereby. If not / so helps it the not / though thou hear a thousa^de masses
in adaye or though thou doist no thing else all thy life long / then eat his
body or drink his blood: no moare then it should help the in a deed thurst /
to behold a bussh at a tavern door / if thou knew not thereby yt there were
wine with in to be sold.

Baptim.
BAptim has also his word and promise which the pressed ought to teach the
people and Christen them in the english tongue / and not to play the popengay
with Credo say ye / volo say ye and baptis mum say ye / for there ought to
be no mummynge in soch a matter. The pressed before he baptiseth axeth saying:
belevest thou in God the father almighty / and in his son Jesus Christ / and
in the holy ghost / and that the congregation of christ is holy. And they say
ye. The^ the pressed appon this faith baptiseth the child in the name of the
father / and of the son / and of the holy ghost / for ye forgevenesse of
si^nes / as peter says Act. ij

The washing without the word helps not: but through the word it purifieth
and cleanses us. As thou read Ephe. v. How christ cleanses the congregation
in the founteyne of water through the word. The word is the promise that God
has made How the sacraments iust^fy.
Now as a preacher / in preachinge the word of God saves ye hearers that
beleve / so does the washinge in that it preaches and represents unto us
the promise that God has made unto us in Christ. The washinge preaches unto
us / that we are cleansed with Christ's bloudeshedinge which was an offeringe
and a satisfaction for the sin of all that repent and beleve consentinge and
submittinge them selves unto the will of God. The plunginge in to the water
signifies that we dye and are buried with Christ as co^cerninge the old life
of sin which is Adam. And the pullinge out again signifie^h that we rise
again with christ in a new life full of the holy ghost which shall teach us
and gyde us and work the will of God in us as thou seist Roma. vj.

Of wedlock.
Matrimony or wedlock is a state or a degree ordined of god and an office
where in ye husband serves ye wife and ye wife ye husbo^de. It was ordined
for a remedy and to increase the world / and for the man to help the woman
and the woman the man with all love and kinds / and not to signify any
promise that ever I herd or read of in ye scripture. Matrimony was not
ordained to signyfy any promise.
Therefore ought it not to be called a sacrament. It has a promise that we
sin not in that state / if a man receave his wife as a gift geven to him of
God / and the wife her husbo^de like wise: as all manner meats and drinks have
a promise that we sin not / if we use them measurably with thanks gevinge.
If they call matrimony a sacrament because the scripture uses the similitude
of matrimony to express the marriage or wedlock that is between us and
christ (For as a woman though she be never so pore / yet when she is married /
is as rych as her husband: even so we when we repent and beleve the promises
of God in Christ / though we be never so pore sinners / yet are as rich as
Christ / all his merits are ours with all that he has) If for that cause
they call it a sacrament: so will I musterde seed / leven / a net / keys /
bred / water and a thousand other things which Christ and the prophets and
all the scripture use / to express the kyndgome of heven and Gods word with
all. They praise wedlock with their mouth / and say it is an holy If wedlock
be holy why had they lever have whores then wives.
thing / as it is verily: but had lever be sanctified with an whore / the^ to
come with in ye sentory

Of order.
SVbdeaco^ / deacon / pressed / Bisshope / Cardinal / Patriarch and Pope / be
names of offices and serves or should be / and not sacraments. There is no
promise coupled therewith. If they minister their offices truly / it is a sign
that Christ's sprite is in them / if not / that the devyll is in them. Are these
all sacraments / or which one of them? Or what thing in them is that holy
sign or sacrament? The shavinge or the anoyntinge? What also is the promise
that is signified thereby? But what words printeth in them that character
Character.
that spiritual seal? O dreamers and natural beestes without ye seal of the
sprite of God: but sealed with the mark of the beeste and with cancred
consciences.

There is a word called in latin sacerdos in greek hiereus / in hebrew cohan
/ Sacerdos.
that is a minister an officer / a sacrificer or a pressed / as Aaron was a
priest and sacrificed for the people and was a mediator between God and them
And in the english should it have had some other name then priest: But
Antychrist has deceaved us with unknown and strange terms / to bring us in
to confusion and supersticious blindenes. Of that manner is Christ a priest for
ever and all we prestes through him and neade no moare of any soch priest on
earth to be a mean for us unto God. For Christ has brought us all in into the
inner temple within the veil or forehanginge / and unto the mercy stole of
God. And has coupled us unto God / where we offer every man for him self the
desires and petitions of his heart / and sacrifice and kill the lusts and
appetites of his flesh with prayer / fasting and all manner godly livinge.

Presbiter*
A another word is there in greek called presbiter / in laten / senior / in
english an elder and is nothing but an officer to teach and not to be a
mediator between God and us. This neade no anoyntinge of man. Prestes now
ought not to be anointed with oyle^
They of ye old testame^te were anointed with oil / to signify the anoyntynge
of Christ and of us through Christ with the holy ghost. This wise is no man
pressed but he that is chose^ / save as in time of necessite every person
christeneth so may every man teach his wife and household and the wife her
childern. So in time of neade if I se my brother sin I may between him and
me rebuke him and damn his dead by the law of God. And may also conforte
them that are in despair with the promyses of God / and save them if they
beleve.

The ostice of a priest:
By a pressed then in the new testamente understand nothing but an elder to
teach the younger and to bring them unto the full knowledge and understanding
of Christ and to minister the sacraments which Christ ordained / which is
also nothing but to preach Christ's promises. And by them that geve all their
study to quench the light of troth and to hold the people in darkness
understand the disciples of satan and messngers of Antichriste / what so ever
names they have or what so ever they call them selves. And as concerning that
our spiritualie (as they will be called) make them selves They will be hol^er but
their deades be not holy at all.
holyer the^ the lay people and take so great l^ndes and goods to pray for
them / and promise them pardons and forgevenes of sins / or absolution /
without preachinge of Christ's promises / is falsheed and the work^nge of
Antichriste and (as I have said) the ra^eninge of those wolfes which Paul
(Actui^. xx.) prophesied / should come after his departinge not sparinge the
flock. Their doctrine is that marchaundice whereof Peter speaks saying:
through covetousnes shall they with feigned words make marchau^d^ce of you.ij.
Pe. ij. And their reasons wherewith they prove their doctrine are (as says
Paul.j. Timo. vi.) superfluous disputi^ges / argui^ges or braulinges of men
with corrupt minds and destitute of troth / which think yt lucre is
godlynes. Compare ther^ deades to the doctrine and deades of Christ and of his
postles and iudg^ there fruits.
But Christ says Math. vij. by their fruits shall thou know them / that is
by their fylthy covetousnes and shameless ambition and dronken desire of honor
/ contrary unto the example and doctrine of Christ and of his Apostles. Christ
said to Peter / the last chapter of John. Feed my sheep / and not shere thy
flock. And Peter says.j. Petri. v. Not being lords over the pharishes: but
these shere ^ are become lords. Paul says.ij. Corinth. j Not that we be
lords over your faith: b^t these will be lords and compel us to bel^ve what
so ever they lust / without any witness of scripture / ye clean contrary to
^he scripture / when the open text rebukes i^. Paul says / it is better to
geve then receave. Act. xx. But these do nothing in the world but lay
snares to ketch and receave what so ever comes / as it were the gapinge mouth
of hell. And.ij. Corinth. xij. I sele not yours but you: but these seek not
your Christ but yours to them selves / and therefore lest their deades should
be rebuked will not come at the light.

Nevertheless the truth is / that we are al equally beloved in Christ / and
God has sworn to all indifferently. According therefore as every man beleveth
Gods promises longs for them and is diligente to pray unto God to fulfill
them so is his prayer herd / and as good is the prayer of a cobbler / as of a
Cardinal / and of a bocher / as of a Bisshope / and the blessinge of a baker
that knows the troth / is ^s good as the blessinge of our most holy father
the Pope. And by blessinge What blessinge meane^^.
understand not the wagginge of the Popes or Bisshopes hand over thine heed /
but prayer as when we say God make the a good man / Christ put his sprite in
the or geve the grace and power to walk in the truth and to follow his
co^maundmentes etc. As Rebeccaes friends blessed her when she departed / Gene.
xxiiij saying. Thou art our sister: grow unto thousand thousands and thy
sede possess the yates of their enemies. And as Isaac blessed Jacob Gene.
xxvij. saying. God geve the of the dew of heven and of the fatnes of the earth
abundaunce of corn / wine and oil etc. And Gene. xxviij. Almighty God bless
the and make the grow / and multiply the / that thou may be a great
multitude of people and geve to the and to thy sede after the the blessings of
Abraham / that thou may possess the land wherein thou art a stranger which
he promised to thy graundfader and soch like.

Last of all one synguler doubt they have / what makes the pressed / the
anoyntynge or puttinge on of the hondes or what other cerimonie or what words.
About which they braule and scolde one ready to tear out a nothers throat. One
says this and a another that / but can not agree. Nether can any of them make so
strong a reason which a another can not improve. For they are all out of the
way and without the sprite of God to judge spiritual things. How be it to
this I answer / yt when Christ called.xij. up in to the mountain and chose
them / then immediately without any annoyntynge or ceremony were they his
Apostles / that is to wete / ministres chosen to be sent to preach his
testamente unto all the whole world. And after the resureccion when he had
opened their wits and geven them knowleage to understand the secrets of his
testamente and how to bind and lowse and what he would have them to do in all
things / then he sent them forth with a commandment to preach and bind the
vnbelevinge that continue in sin / and to lowse the belevinge that repent.
The commandment makes prestes.
And that commandment or charge made them Bisshopes Prestes / Popes and all
thing. If they say that Christ made them prestes at his mayndey or last soper
when he said / do this in the remembrance of me. I answare / though the
Apostles wist not then what he meant / yet I will not stryve nor say that
agenst / Never the later the commaundmente and the charge which he gave the^
made the^ prestes.

And / Acts the first / when Mathias was chosen by lotte / it is not to be
douted but that the Apostles / after their commune manner / prayed for him that
God would geve him grace to minister his office truly and put their hands on
hi^ / and exhorted hi^ and gave him charge to be dilige^te and faith full and
the^ was he as great as the best. And acts.vj. When the disciples that beleved
had chosen.vj. Deacons to mynistre to the wydowes / the Apostles prayed and put
their hands on them and admitted them without moare adoo. Putt^nge on of
hands.
Their puttinge on of hands was not after the manner of the dome blessinge of
our holy Bisshopes with two fyngers: but they spoke unto them and told them
their duty and gave them a charge and warned them to be faithful in the
lords busynes: as we chose temperall officers and read their duty to them
and they promise to be faithful mynistres and then are admitted. Nether is
there any other manner or ceremony at all required in making of our spiritual
officers / then to chose an able person and then to rehearse him his duty and
geve him his charge and so to put him in his rowme. And as for that other
solenne doubt / as they call it wether What Judas is now.
Judas was a pressed or no / I ^are not what he then was: but of this I am sure /
that he is now not only pressed / but also Bisshope / Cardinal and Pope.

Of penavnce
Penance is a word of their own forginge to disceave us with all / as many
other are. In the scripture we find penitentia repentance. Agite penitentiam
/ do tepente / Peniteat vos / let it repent you. Metanoyte in greek /
forthinke ye / or let it forthinke you. A point of practice.
Of repentance they / have made penance / to blind the people and to make
the^ think that they must take pain and do some holy deades to make
satisfaction for their sins / namely soch as they enjoin them.
As thou may se in the chronicles / when great kings and Tyrants (which
with violence of sword conquered other kings lo^des and slew all that came to
hand) came to them selves and had conscience of their weked deades / then the
Bisshopes coupled them / not to Christ: but unto the Pope and preached the
Pope unto them / and made them to submit them selves and also their realms
unto the holy father the Pope and to take penance / as they call it / that is
to say / soch iniuncions as the Pope and Bisshopes would command them to do
/ to byld abbays / to endote them with lyvelode / to be prayed fort for ever:
and to geve them exemptions and prevelege and licens to do what the lust
unpunished.

Repentance
Repentance goes before faith and prepares the way to Christ and to the
promises. For christ comes not / but unto them that se their sins in the law
and repent. Repentance that is to say / this morning and sorrow of the heart
lasts all our lyves long. For we find our selves all our lyves long to
weak for Gods law / and therefore sorrow and morn lo^ginge for strength
Repentance is no sacrament: as faith hope / love / and knowleginge of a man's
sins are not to be called sacraments. For they are spiritual and invisible.
Now must a sacrame^te be an outward sign that may be seen / to signify / to
represente and to put a man in remembrance of some spiritual promise which
can not be seen but by faith only. Repentance and all the good deades which
accompany repentance to sley the lusts of the flesh are signified by
Repentance is signified by baptim.
baptim. For Paul says Roma. vj. (as it is above rehearsed). Remember ye not
(says he) that all we which are baptized in the name of Christ Jesus / are
baptized to dye with him? we are buried with him in baptim for to dye / that is
/ to kill the lusts and the rebellion which remains in the flesh. And after
that he says / ye are deed as concerning sin but lyve unto God / through
Jesus Christ our lord.
If thou look on the profession of our hertes and on the spirit and forgevenes
which we have received through Christ's merits / we are full deed: but if thou
look on the rebellion of the flesh we do but begin to dye and to be baptized
that is / to dround and quench the lusts / and are full baptized at the last
mynute of deeth And as concerning the workinge of the sprite we begin to
lyve and grow every day moare and moare both in knowleage and also in Godly
lyvinge / according as the lusts abate. As a child receaveth the full soul
at the first day / yet grows daily in the operations and works thereof.

Of confession.
COnfession is diverse? One follows true faith inseperably. One confession is
to knowledge where in thou put thy trust.
And is the confessinge and knowleginge with the mouth / wherein we put our
trust and confidence. As when we say our credo: confessinge yt we trust in
God the father almighty and in his truth and promises: and in his son Jesus
our lord and in his merits and deservinges: and in the holy ghost / and in
his power / assistence and gidinge. This confession is necessary unto all men
that will be saved. For Christ says Matthew x. he that denies me before men
him will I deny before my father that is in heven. And of this confession
says the holy Apostel Paul in the.x. chapter / The belefe of the heart
justifies: and to knowleage with the mouth makes a man safe. This is a
wonderful text for our philosophers or rather sophisters / our wordly wise
/ enemies to the wisdom of God / our deep and profunde wells with out water
/ our clouds without moisture of rain / that is to say / natural souls
without the sprite of God and fealinge of godly things. To justify and to
make safe are both one thing. And to confess with the mouth is a Good work
and the fruit of a true says / as all other works are.

If thou repent and beleve the promyses then Gods truth justifies the / that
is / forgeveth the thy sins and seals / the with his holy sprite and makes
the heir of everlastinge life through Christ's deservynges. Now if thou have
true faith so seist thou the exceadinge and infinite love and mercy which God
has showed the freely in Christ: then must thou neades love again: and love
can not but compel the to work and boldly to confess and knowleage thy lord
Christ and the trust which thou have in his word. If when tira^tes oppose the
thou have power to confess then art thou sure that thou art saffe.
And this knowledge makes the safe / that is / declares that thou art safe all
ready and certyfieth thine heart and makes the feale that thy faith is right
and that Gods sprite is in the / as all other good works do For if when it
comes unto the point / thou have no lust to work nor power to confess / how
coudest thou presume to think that Gods sprite were in the?

A norher confession is to ^ knowledge thy sins in thine heart unto God^
A another confession is there which goes before faith and accompanyeth
repentance. For who so ever repents does knowledge his sins in his heart.
And whosoever does knowledge his sins receaveth forgevenes (as says John.
in the first of his first Pistle) If we knowledge our sins he is faithful
and just to forgeve us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness /
that is / because he / has promised / he must for his truethes sake do it.
This confession is necessary all our lyves long / as is repentance. And as
thou vnderstondest of repentance / so understand of this confession for it is
like wise included in the sacrame^te of Baptim. For we all ways repent and
all ways knowleage or confess our sins unto god / and yet dispeare not:
but remember that we are washed in Christ's blood / which thing our baptim
does represente and signify unto us.

Shrifte.
Shrifte in the ear is verily a work of satan and that the falsest that ever
was wroughte and that most has devoured the faith. It began among the greeks
and was not as it is now / to reken all a man's sins in the prestes ear: but
to axe counsel of soch doutes as men had / as thou may se in saint Hierom and
in other autours. Nether went they to prestes only which were very few at that
time / no moo the^ preached the word of God / for this so great vauntage in
so many masses saying was not yet found: but went indifferently / where they
saw a good and a learned man. Shrifte was put down for knave^y among the
greeks But is stablished thereby among us.
And for because of a little knavery which a deaco^ at Consta^tynopyll played
through confession with one of the chief wives of ye cite it was laid down
again. But we Antichrists possession / ye moare knavery we se grow therefore
daily / the moare we stablysh it. A christian man is a spiritual thing and
has Gods word in his heart and Gods sprite to certify him of all thing. He
is not bound to come to any ear. And as for the reasons which they make are
but persuasio^s of man's wisdom. First as perteyninge unto the keys and manner
of byndinge and loosinge is enough above rehearsed and in other places. Thou
may also se how the Apostles used them in the Acts and in Paulus pistles /
how at the preachinge of faith the sprite came and certified their hertes that
they were justified through belevinge the promises. How a man shall know that
his sins are forgeven.


When a man fealeth that his heart consents unto the law of God / and fealeth
him self meke / pacient / curtous and merciful to his neyboure / altered and
fascioned like unto Christ / why should he doubt but that God has forgeven him
and chosen him and put his sprite in him / though he never cromme his sin in
to the prestes ear?

Blind reason is there gyde and not gods spirit.
One blind reason have they saying. How shall the pressed vnbynd / loose and
forgeve the sin which he knows not? How did the Apostles? The scripture
forsake they and run unto their blind reasons and draw the scripture unto a
carnal purpose. When I have told the in thine ear all that I have done my
life lonhe / in ordyr and with all circumstances after the shamefullest manner /
what can thou do moare / then preach me the promyses saying: If thou
repent and beleve / Gods truth shall save the for Christ's sake? Thou seist
not mine heart / thou know not whether I repent or no / nether whether I
consent to the law / that it is holy righteous and good. Moare over whether I
beleve the promyses or no / is also unknown to the. If thou preach the law and
the promyses (as the Apostles did) so should they that God has chosen repent
and beleve and besaved: even now as well as then. How be it Antychrist must
know all secrets to stablesh his kingdom and to work his mysteries with all.

They bring also for them the story of the.x. lepers. which is written in
the.xvij chap. of Luke. Learn to know them for they are verily lepers in their
hertes.
Here mark their falsheed and learn to know them for ever. The fourtene
sunday after the Feast of the Trinite the beginning of the.vij. lesson is the
said Gospel and the.viij. and the.ix. lessons with the rest of the seventh is
the exposicion of Bid upon the said Gospel Where / says Bid / of all that
Christ healed of what so ever disease it were / he sent none unto the prestes /
but the lepers. And by the lepers enterpreteth folowers of false doctrine only
/ which the spiritual officers / and the learned men of the congregation ought
to examine / and rebuke their lerninge with Gods word and to warn the
congregation to be war of them Which / if they were afterward healed by the
grace of Christ / ought to come before the congregation and there openly
confess their true faith.

But all other vices (says he) does God heal within in the conscience.
Though they this wise read at matens / yet at hye mass / if they have any
sermon at all / they lie clean contrary unto this open truth. Another are they
ashamed at all. For why they walk all to gether in darkness.

Of contrition
COntrition and repentance are both one and nothing else but a sorrowful and
a morning heart. And because that God has promised mercy unto a co^trite
heart / that is / to a sorrowful and repe^tinge heart they to begyle Gods word
and to stablysh their weked tradition / have feigned that new word attrition
saying: thou can not know whether thy sorrow or repentance be Attricio^ is
of the leve^ of the phareses.
contrition or attrition / except thou be shreven. When thou art shreve^ /
the^ it is true contrition. Oh foxy pharesay / that is thy leven / of which
Christ so diligently hade us beware. Mathe. vj. And the very prophecy of
Peter through covetousnes with feigned words shall they make marcha^dice of
you.ij. Petri. ij. with soch gloses (...) they Gods word / to sytte in the
cons^^^nces of the people / to lead the^ captive (...) to make a pray of
them: byenge and ^ellinge their sins / to satisfy their insatiable
covetousnes. Never the less the truth is / when any man has trespased against
God. If he repent and knowleage his trespase / God promyseth him forgevenesse
without ear shrifte.

If he that has offended his neyboure repent and knowledge his fault axinge
forgevenes / if his neyboure forgeve him / God forgeveth him also / by his holy
promise / Mat. xviij. Like wise i^ he that synneth openly / when he is openly
rebuked / repent and turn / then if the congregation forgeve him God
forgeveth him. And so forth who so ever repents and when he is rebuked
knowlegeth his fault is forgeven.

He also that douteth or has his conscience tangled / ought to open his mind
unto some faithful brother that is learned / and he shall geve him faithful
council to help him with all.

To whom a man trespaseth unto him he ought te confess. Who^ a man offends
to hi^ must he confess.
But to confess my self unto the O Antichriste / whom I have not offended /
am I not bound.

They of the old law had no confession in the ear. Nether the Apostles nor
they that followed many hundred years after knew of any soch whisperinge. Whereby
then was their attrition turned unto contrition? ye why are we which Christ
came to lowse moare bound then the Jews. Ye and why are we moare bound
without scripture? For Christ came not to make us moare bond / but to loose
us and to make a thousand things no sin which before were sin and are now
become sin again. He left no another law with us but the law of love. He
loosed us not from Moses to bind us unto Antichrists ear. God (...) not
tied Christ unto Antichrists ear nether has poured all his mercy in thither
for it has no record in the old testamente / that Antichrists ear should
be Propiciatorium / that is to were Gods mercy stole / and that God should
crepe in to so narow a hole / so that he could no where else be found. It has
no record in the scripture that God should crepe in and hyde him self in
a^tychristis ear
Nether did God write his laws nether yet his holy promyses in Antichrists
ear: but has graved them with his holy sprite in the hertes of them that
beleve / that they might have them all ways ready at hand to be saved thereby.

Satisfaccion.
AS perteynynge unto satisfaccion / this wise understand / that he that loves
god has a co^mau^dme^t (as saint John says in ye fourth chapter of his first
pistle) to love his neyboure also who^ if thou have offended thou must make him
amends or satisfaccion or at the lest way if thou be not able / axe him
forgevenes / and if he will have mercy of God / he is bound to forgeve the. If
he will not: yet God forgeveth ye / if thou this submit thy self. Christ is
an everlastinge satisfaccion.
But unto Godwarde Christ is a perpetual and an everlastinge satisfaccion for
ever moare.

As often as thou fallest through fraylte / repent and come again and thou art
safe and welcome / as thou may se by the similitude of the riotuous son
Luke. xv. If thou be lope^ out of sentuary come in again. If thou befallen
from the way of truth come thereto again and thou art safe / if thou begone
astraye come to the fold again and the sheperd Christ shall save the ye and
the angels of heven shall rejoice at thy coming / so far it is of that any
man shall beat the or chyde the. If any Pharisey envye the / grudge at the or
rail upon the / thy father shall make answer for the / as thou seist in the
fore tehersed lykenes or parable. Who so ever therefore is gone out of the way
by what so ever chance it be / let him come to his baptim again and unto the
profession thereof and he shall be saffe. Baptim l^steth ever


For though that the washinge of baptim be past / yet the power thereof / that
is to say / the word of God which baptim preaches lasts ever and saves
for ever. As Paul is past and gone / never the less the word that Paul
preached lasts ever and saves ever as many as come thereto with a repentinge
heart and a steadfast faith.

Here by feist thou that when they make pennaunce of repentance and call it a
sacrament and divide it in to contricion / confession and satisfaccion they
speak of their own heedes and lie falslye.

Absolucion.
THeir absolucion also justifies no man from sin. For with the heart do men
beleve to be justified with all / says Paul Romna. x. that is through faith and
belevinge the promises / are we justified / as I have sufficiently proved in
other places with the scripture. Faith (says Paul in the same place) comes by
heringe / that is to say / by hearing the preacher that is sent from God and
preaches Gods promises. Now when thou absolvest in latyne the unlearned hears
not. For how / says Paul.j. Corint. xiiij. when thou blessest in an unknown
tongue / shall the unlearned say Amen unto thy thanks gevinge? for he wotteth
not what thou say. So like wise the lay wotteth not whether thou loose or
bind / or whether thou bless or curse. In like manner is it if the lay
understand latyne or though the pressed absolve in english. For in his
absolucion he reherseth no promise of God: but speaks his awn words saye^ge:
I by the auctorite of Peter and Paul absolve or loose the from all thy sins.
Thou say so / which art but a lyinge man and never moare then now verily.

Thou say I forgeve the thy sins / and the scripture says (John the first)
that Christ only forgeveth and takes away the sins of the world. And Paul
and Peter and all the Apostles preach that all is forgeven in Christ and for
Christ's sake. Gods word only loses and thou in preachinge that might
loose also and else not.

Who so ever has ears let him hear and let him that has eyes / se. If any
man love to be blind / his blyndnes on his awn heed and not on mine.
THey allege for them selves the saying of Christ to Peter Math. xvj. what so
ever thou byndest on earth / it shall be bond / and what so ever thou loosest /
it shall be looset / and so forth. Of byndynge and loosynge and of the popis
auctorit^ or power.
Lo say they / what so ever we bind and what so ever we loose here is no
thing excepted. And a another text lay, they of Christ in the last of Matthew
All power is geven to me says Christ / in heven and in earth: goo therefore and
preach etc. Preachinge leaves the Pope out and says loo all power is geven me
in heven and in earth. The pope cale^geth power not over man only but over God
also.
And therapon takes upon him temporal power above king and Emperor / and
makes laws and byndeth them. And like power takes he over Gods laws and
dispenses with them at his lust / making no sin of that which God makes
sin and makes sin where God makes none: ye and wypeth out Gods laws
clean and makes at his pleasure / and with him is lawful what he lusts. He
byndeth where God loses and loses where God byndeth. He blesses where God
curses and curses where God blesses. He takes auctorite also to bind and
loose in purgatory. Purgatory is the popis creature he may therefore be bold
there.
That permit I unto him: for it is a creature of his awn making. He also
byndeth the angels. For we read of Popes that have commanded the angels to
fett dyvers out of purgatory. The pope binds the angels.
How be it I am not yet certified whether they obeyed or no.

The true binninge and loosynge.
Understand therefore that to bind and to loose / is to preach the law of God
and the gospel or promyses / as thou may se in the thread chapter of the
second pistle to the Corintheans Where Paul calls the preachinge of the law
the ministration of deeth and damnation / and the preachinge of the promyses
the^ ministri^ge of the sprite and of righteousness. For when the law is
preached all men are found sinners and therefore damned: and when the Gospel
and glad tydinges are preached / then are all that repent and beleve / found
righteous in Christ. And so expound it all the old doctors. Saint Saint
Hiero^ agenst bisshopes ad prestes.
Hierom says upon this text / what so ever thou byndest / the bisshopes and
prestes says he / for lack of understanding / take a little presumption of
the phareses upon them. And think that they have auctorite to bind innoce^tes
and to loose the weked / which thing our Pope and Bisshopes do. For they say
the curse is to be feared / be it right or wrong. The curse is to be fered.
Though thou have not deserved yet if the Pope curse the thou art in perell of
thy soul as they lie: ye and though he be never so wronfully cursed / he must
be feign to bye absolutio^. The right manner of loosynge.
But saint Hiero^ says as the pressed of the old law made the lepers clean or
oncleane / so byndeth and unbinds the pressed of the new law


The pressed there made no man a leper nether cleansed any man / but God: and the
pressed judged only by Moses law who was clean and who was unclean / when they
were brought unto him.

So here we have the law of God to judge what is sin and what is not / and
who is bound and who is not. Moare over if any man have sinned / yet if he
repent and beleve the promise / we are sure by gods word that he is loosed
and forgeven in Christ Other auctoryte then this wise to preach / have the
prestes not. Christis Apostles had no another the^ selfs as it appears
thorowout all the new testamente. Therefore it is manifest that they have not.

Saint Paul says.j. Corinth. xv. Christ understood this text all power is
geve^ me en heve^ and ^n earth and also used it far other wise the^ the Pope.
When we say all things are under Christ / he is to be excepted that putt all
under him. God the father is not under Christ / but above Christ and Christ's
heed.j. Corinth. vi. Christ says John. xij. I have not spoken of mine awn
heed but my father which sent me / gave a commandment what I should say /
and what I should speak. What so ever I speak therefore / even as my father
bade me so I speak. If Christ had a law what he should do / how happens it
/ that the Pope so runs at large lawless? Though that all power were geven
unto Christ in heven and in earth. Yet had he no power over his father ner yet
to raygne temporally over temporal princes: but a commaundmente to obey them.
How has the Pope then soch temperall auctorite over king and Emperor? How
has he auctorite above Gods laws and to command the angels / the saints
and God him self?

Christ's What auctorite christ gave his apostles
auctorite which he gave to his disciples / was to preach the law and to bring
sinners to repentance / and then to preach unto them the promyses which the
father had made unto all men for his sake. And the same to preach only sent he
his Apostles The right byndinge and loosynge.
As a king sends forth his judges and geveth them his auctorite saying:
What ye do that do I. I geve you my full power. Yet means he not by that
full power / that they should destroy any town or Cite / or oppress any man
or do what they list or should raygne over the lords and dukes of his Realm
and over his own self. But geveth them a law with them and auctorite to bind
and loose / as ferforth as the law stretches and makes mention: that is / to
punesh the evyll / that do wrong / and to avenge the pore that sofre wrong.
And so fer as the law stretches / will the king defend his judge agenst all
men. And as the temperall judges bind and loose temperally / so do the
prestes spiritually and no other ways. How be it by falsheed and sotyltye the
Pope regneth under Christ / as cardinals and Bisshopes do under kings
lawless. How the pope regneth under christ.


THe Pope (say they) absolveth or loses a pena et a culpa / that is from the

is a propir dream
God if a man repe^te forgeveth the offense only / and not the pain also /
say they / save turns the everlastinge pain unto a temperall pain. And
apoynteth seven years in purgatory for every deedly sin The pope y^ moare

But the Pope for money for geveth both / and has moare power then God and is
moare merciful then God. This do I / seaith the Pope of my full power and of
the treasure of the church / of deservinges of martirs / confessors and
merits of Christ.

The merits of saints.

Christ's merits only.

Secondaryly God has promised Christ's The merits of christ.
merits unto all that repent: so that whosoever repents is immediately heir
of all Christ's merits and beloved of god as Christ is. The pope sells that
which God geveth freely.
How then came this foul monster to be lord over Christ's merits / so that
he has power to sell that which god geveth freely. O dreamers / ye o devels
and o venymous scorpions what poison have ye in your tails? O pestilent leven
that so turns the sweet bred of Christ's doctrine in to the bitternisse of
gall.

Freres*
The freres run in the same spirit and teach saying: do good deades and
redeem the pains that abide you in purgatory ye geve us some what to do good
works for you. Sin is the best marchaundice that is.
And this is sin become the profitablest mirchaundice in the world. O the
cruel wrath of God upon us because we love not the troth.

For this is the damnation and judgment of God to send a falls prophet unto
him that will not hear the troth. I know you says Christ John. v. that ye
have not the love of God in you. Christ prophesied of antichriste and told why
he should come.
I am come in my faders name and ye receave me not / if a another shall come in
his own name / him shall ye receave. This does God ave^ge him self on the
malicious hertes which have no love to his truth.

All the promyses of God have they other wypt clean out or thus levended them
with open lies to stablysh their confession with all. The promyses are either
put out or leve^ded and why.
And to keep us from knowleage of the troth / they do all thing in latyne.
Al is in latin


They pray in latyne / they Christen in latyne / they bless in latyne / they
geve absolution in latyne only curse they in the english tongue. Wherein they
take upon them greater auctorite then ever God gave them. For in their curses
as they call them / with book bell and candle / they command The pope
commands god to curse.
God and Christ and the angels and al saints to curse the^: curse the^ God
(say they) father / son and holy ghost / curse them virgen Mary. etce. O ye
abominable? Who gave you auctorite to command God to curse? God ^ommaundeth
you to bless and ye command him to curse. Bless them that persecute you:
bless but curse not says Saint Paul Romanorum. xij. What tyranny will these
not use over men / which presume and take upon them to be lords over God and
to command him? If God shall curse any man who shall bless and make him
better? No man can amend him self / except God pour his sprite unto him.
Have we not a co^maundmente to love our neyboure as our self? How can I love
him and curse him also? James says / it ^s not possible that blessinge and
cursinge should come both out of one mouth. Christ commands. Math. v.
saying: love your enemies. Bless the^ that curse you. Do good to them that
hate you. Pray for them that do you wrong and persecute you / that ye may be
the childerne of your hevenly father.

In the marches of wales it is the manner if any man have an ox or a cow
stolen / he comes to the curate and desires him to curse the steyler. A
custom that is used in the marches of wales.
And he commands the pareshe to geve him every man Gods curse and his. Gods
curse and mine have he / says everyma^ in the pareshe. O merciful God what is
blasphemy / if this be not blasphemy and shamynge of the doctrine of Christ?

Understood therefore / the power of excommunication is this. If any man sin
openly and amendeth not when he is warned: then ought he to be rebuked openly
before all the paresh And the priest ought to prove by the scripture / that all
soch have no part with Christ. For Christ serves not but for them that love
the law of God and consent that it is good holy and righteous. And repent
sorowinge and morning for power and strength to fulfill it. And all the
pareshe ought to be warned / to avoyde the company of all soch / and to take
the^ as hethe^ people. This is not done that he should perish / but to save him
/ to make him ashamed and to kill the lusts of the flesh / that the sprite
might come unto the knowledge of the truth. And we ought to pity him and to
have compassion on him and with all diligence to pray unto* God for him / to
geve him grace to repent and to come to the right way again / and not to use
soch tyranny over God and man / commaundinge God to curse. And if he repent we
ought with all mercy to receave hi^ in again. This may thou se Math. xviij.

Confirmacion.
IF confirmacion have a promise / then it justifies / as fer as the promise
extends. If it have no promise / then is it not of God as the Bysshopes be
not. Gods sacraments preach gods promyses^
The Apostles and minesters of God preach Gods word / and Gods signs or
sacraments signify Gods word also and put us in remembrance of the promyses
which God has made unto us in Christ. The popes sacraments are doume.
Contrary wise Antychristes Bisshopes preach not and their sacraments speak
not / but as the disgysed Bisshopes mum / so are their supersticious
sacraments doume. After that the Bisshopes had left preachinge / then feigned
they this dome ceremony of confirmacion to have somewhat at the lest way /
whereby they might regne over their dioceses. Christenynge of belles.
They reserved unto them selves also the christeninge of belles and coniuringe
or haulsoninge of churches and churchyardes / and of altares and superaltares /
and holowinge of chalices and so forth / what so ever is of honor or profitt.
Which confirmacion and the other coniuracions also they have now committed to
their Why sofrega^s a^e ordained.
Suffreganes: because they them selves have no leysoure to mynister soch
things / for their lusts and plealures and abondaunce of all things / and
for the combraunce that they have in the kings matters and busynisse of the
realm. The bisshops devide al among them.
One keeps the privey seal / a another the great seal / the thryd is
confessoure / that is to say / a privey traytar and a secret Judas / he is
presidente of the princes council / he an ambassadoure / a another sort are of
the kings secret council. Woo is unto the Realms where they are of the
council. As profitable are they verily unto the Realms with their council /
as the wolves unto the sheep or the foxes unto the gysse.

Ceremonies bring not the holy gooste
They will say that the holy ghost is geven through soch ceremonies. If God had
so promised so should it be / but Paul says Galat. in the third chapter / that
ye sprite is received through preachinge of the faith. And Acts in the tenth
chapter / while Peter preached the faith / the holy ghost fell on Cornelius and
on his houshoulde^ How shall we say then to that which they will lay agenst
us / in the eghre chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. Putting on of hands*
Where Peter and John put their hands on the samaritanes and the holy ghost
came? I say that by puttinge or with puttinge or as they put their hands on
them / the holy ghost came. Never the less the puttinge on of the hands did
another help ner hinder. For the text says they prayed for them that the might
receave the holy ghost.

God had made the Aopstles a promise / that he would with soch miracles
confirm their preachinge and move other to the faith. Mar. the lest. The
Apostels therefore beleved and prayed God to fulfill his promise / and God for
his truethes sake even so did. So was it the Prayer of faith does the miracles.
prayer of faith that brought the holy ghost / as thou may se also in the
last of James. If any man be sick says James / call the elders of the
congregation / and let them pray over him annoyntynge him with oil in the
name of the Lord / and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick. Where a
promise is there is faith bold to pray / and God true to geve her her
peticion. Puttinge on of the hondes is an indiffere^te thing. For the holy
ghost came by preachinge of the faith / and miracles were done at ye prayer of
faith as well with out puttinge on of hondes as with / as thou seist in many
places. Puttinge on of the hondes was the manner of that nacio^ / as it was to
rent their clothes / and to put on sack / and to sprinkle them selves with
ashes and earth / when they herd of or saw any sorrowful thing / as it was
Paul's manner to stretch out his hand / when he preached. And as it is our manner
to hold up our hands / when we pray / and as some kiss their thome nail
and put it to their eyes / and as we put our hands on chylders heedes / when
we bless them saying: Christ bless the my son / and God make the a good
man: which gestures nether help ner hinder. This may thou well se by
the.xiij. of the Acts / where the holy ghost commanded to separate Paul and
Barnabas / to go and preeache. Then the other fasted and prayed and put their
hands on their heedes and sent them forth. They received not the holy ghost
then / by puttinge on of hondes / but the other as they put their hands on
their heedes prayed for them / that God would go with them and strength them /
and coraged them also / biddinge the^ to be strong in God / and warned them to
be faithful and diligent in the work of God and so forth.

Anoylynge.
LAst of all comes the anoylynge with out promise / and therefore without the
spirit and with out profitt / but all together unfruitful and supersticious.
The sacraments which they have imagined are all without promise / and therefore
help not. For what so ever is not of faith is sin. Roman. xiiij. Now without
a promise can there be no faith. The latyne tongue destroys the faith.
The sacraments which Christ him self ordained / which have also promyses and
would save us if we knew them and beleved them / them minister they in the
latyne tongue. So are they also become as unfruitful as the other. Ye the make
us beleve that the work self without the promise saves us which doctrine
they learned of Aristotell. That the work with out the promise saves is
improved.
And thus are we become an hundred times worse then the weked Jews which
beleved that the very work of their sacrifyce justified them. Agenst which
Paul fyghteth in every pistle / provinge that nothing helps save the
promyses which God has sworn in Christ. The people beleve in the work with
out the promise.
Ask the people what they understand by their baptim or washinge. And thou
shall se that they beleve / how that the very plunginge in to the water saves
them: of the promyses they know not / ner what is sygnifyed thereby. Baptim is
called volowi^ge in many places of England / because the pressed says volo say
ye. Uolowinge.
The child was well volowed (say they) ye and our vicare is as fair a
volower as ever a pressed within this twenty miles.

Behold how narowly the people look on the ceremony. If ought be left out / or
if the child be not al together dipped in the water / or if / because the child
is sick / the pressed dare not plu^ge him into the water / but power water on
his heed / how tri^ble they? how quake they? how say ye sir Ihon / say they /
is this child christened enough? has it his full christendom? They beleve
verily that the child is not christened:
ye I have known prestes that have gone unto the orders again supposinge that
they were not prestes / because that the bysshope left one of his ceremonies
undone. That the call confirmation / the people call byshopynge. They think
that if the bysshope butter the child in the foreheed that it is saffe. The
work saves not but the word that is to say the promise.
They think that the work makes saffe / and like wise suppose they of an
oylinge. Now is this false doctrine verily. For James says in the first
chapter of his Pistle. Of his good will begat he us with the word of life /
that is / with the word of promise In which are we made Gods sons and heirs
of the goodness of God before any good works. For we can not work Gods will
till we be his sons and know his will and have his sprite to teach us. And
saint Paul says in the fyft chapter of his pistle to the Ephesia^s. Christ
cle^sed the congregation in the fountain of water through the word. And Peter
says in the first of his first pistle. Ye are borne anew / not of mortal seed
/ but of immortal seed / by the word of God which lyveth and lasts ever.
Paul in every pistle warns us that we put no trust in works / and to beware
of persuasions or arguments of man's wisdom of superstitiousnes / of
ceremonies of Pope holiness and of all manner disgisinge. And exhorts us to
cleve fast unto the naked and pure word of God
The promise of God is the ancre that saves us in all temptations. If all the
world be agenst us / Gods word is stronger then the world. If the world kill us
/ that shall make us a lyve again. If it be possible for the world to cast us
in to hell from thence yet shall Gods word bring us again. Hereby seist thou
that it is not the work but the promise that justifies us through faith. Now
where no promise is there can no faith be and therefore no iustifienge though
there be never so glorious works. The sacrament of Christ's body after this
wise preach they. Thou must beleve yt it is no moare bred / but the very body
of Christ / flesh / blood and bone / even as he went here on earth / save his
cote. In all thing they leve out the promyses
For that is here yet / I wott not in how many places. I pray the what helps
all this? Here is no promise. The devels know that Christ dyed on a fredaye and
the Jews also. What are they help thereby? We have a promise that Christ and
his body and his blood and all that he did and sofered / is a sacrifice / a
ransom and a full satisfaction for our sins: that God for his sake will
think no moare on them / if we have power to repent and beleve

Holy werkmen think that God reioyseth in the dead self without any forther
respect. They think also that God as a cruel tyrant / reioyseth and has
delecration in our pain taking without any forther respect. And therefore
many of them marter them selves without cause / after the ensample of Baals
prestes which (iij. Regu^. xviij) cut them selves to please their God with all
and as the old hethe^ paga^s sacrificed their childern in the fire unto their
Gods. The monks of the charterhouse think that the very eati^ge of fish in it
self pleases God and refer not the eatinge unto the chastenynge of ye body.
For when they have slain their bodies with cold fleme of fysheatinge: yet
then will they eat no flesh and sley the^ selves before their days. we also
when we offer our sons or doghters and compel or persuade them to vow and
profess chastity / think that the very pain and that rage and burning which
they sofre in absteyninge from a make pleases God / and so refer not our
chastity unto our neybours profit. For when we se thousands fall to
innumerable diseases thereof and to dye before their days: ye though we se
the^ break the commaundmentes of God daily and also of verry impatiency work
abominations agenst nature to shameful to bespoken of: yet will we not let
them mary / but compel them to continue still with violence. And thus teach
our devines as it appears by their arguments. He that takes most pain /
say they / is greatest and so forth.

The people are throuly brought in beleve that the deed in it self without any
forther respect saves the^ if they be so long at church or say so many
pater nosters and read so much in a tongue which they understood not or goo so
much a pilgremage and take so much pain or fast soch a supersticious fast / or
observe soch a superstitious observaunce nether profitable to him self ner to
his neyboure: but done of a good entente only / say they to please God with
all: ye to kiss the paxe they think it a meritorious dead / when to love
their neyboure and to forgeve him / which thing is signified thereby / they
(...) to do^ / nor have power to do / nor (...) that they are bound to do^t /
if they (...) by him. So sore have our falls (...) brought the people out of
their (...) and have wrapped them in darkness and have rocked them a sleep in
blyndnes and ignorancy. Now is all soch doctrine false doctrine / and all soch
faith false faith. For the dead pleases not / but as fer forth as it is
applied unto our neybours profit or the tamynge of our bodies to hepe the
co^maundmente.

Now must the body be tame only / and that with the remeadies that God has
ordened / and not killed. Thou must not forswere the natural reamedy which God
has ordened and bri^ge thy self in to soch case that thou should either
break Gods commaundment or kill thy self or burn night and day without rest
so that thou can not ones think a Godly thought: nether is it lawful to
forsake thy neyboure and to withdraw thy self from servinge him and to get the
in to a den and lyve ydely profitable to no man but robbinge all men / first
of faith and the^ of goods and land and of all he has with making him
beleve in the ypocresy of thy superstitious prayers and Pope holy deades The
prayer of faith and the deades there of that spri^ge of love are accepted before
God The prayer is good according to the proportion of faith and the dead
according to the measure of love. Now he that bydeth in the world / as monks
call it / has moare faith then the cloysterar. For he hangs on God in all
things. He must trust God to send him good speed / good luck / favor
help / a good master / a good neyboure / a good serva^te / a good wife / a
good chapma^ marchand to send his marchaundise saffe to land and a thousand
like. He loves also moare / which appears in that he does service all ways
unto his neyboure. To pray one for a another are we equally bound and to pray
is a thing that we may all ways do / what so ever we have in hand and that
to do may no man hyre a another Christ's blood has hired us all ready. Thus
in the dead deliteth God as ferforth as we do it either to serve our neyboure
with all / as I have said / or to tame the flesh / that we may fulfill the
commaundmente from the bothom of the heart.

And as for our pain taking God reioyseth not therein as a tyraunte: but
pitieth us and as it were morneth with us and is all way ready and at hand to
help us / if we call / as a merciful father and a kind mother. Never the
later he sofereth us to fall in to many temptacions and much adversite: ye him
self lays the cross of tribulacio^ on our backs / not that he reioyseth
in our sorrow / but to dryve sin out of the flesh which ca^ none other wise
be cured: as the physician and surgion do many things which are paynefull to
the sick / not that they rejoice in the pains of the pore wretches: but to
persecute and to dryve out the diseases which can no other wise be healed.

When the people beleve therefore if they do so much work or sofre so much
pain or goo so much a pylgremage / yt they are saffe / is a false faith. For a
christen man is not saved by works / but by faith in the promises before all
good works / though that the works (when we work Gods commaundmente with a
good will and not works of our own imaginacion) declare that we are saffe
and that the sprite of him yt has made us saffe is in us: ye and as God
through preachi^ge of faith does purge and justify / even so through workynge
of deades does he purge and justify the members / making us perfect both in
body and lykenes of Christ. A christian man neadeth not to goo a pylgremage to
be saved thereby.


Nether neadeth a christen man to run hither or thither / to Rome / to
Jerusalem / or saint James or any other pilgremage fer or nere / to be saved
thereby / or to purches forgevenes of his sins. Salvation is with in us.
For a christen man's health and salvation is with in him: even in his mouth.
Roma. x. The word is nythe / even in thy mouth and in thine heart that is the
word of faith which we preach says Paul. If we beleve the promyses with our
hertes and confess them with our mouths / we are saffe. This is our health
with in us. But how shall they beleve that / they hear not? And how shall they
hear without a preacher says Paul Roma. x. For look on the promyses of God
and so are all our preachers dome. Or if they preach them they so sau^e them
and leven them that no stomach can broke them ner find any saver in them. For
they paynte us soch an ear Confession.
confession as is impossible to be kept / and more impossible that it should
stand with the promyses and testamente of God. And they join them penance /
as they call it / to fast / to goo pylgremages and geve so much to make
satisfaccion with all. They pr^ach their masses / their merits / their pardons
/ their ceremonies and put the promise clean out of possession. The word of
health and salvation is nigh the / in thy mouth and thine heart says paul. Nay
say they / thy salvation is in our faithful ear
. That is their hold / thereby know they all secrets / there by mock they all
men and all men's wives and begyle knight and squire / lord and king / and
betraye all realms. Bisshopes work there treason through cofession.
The Bisshopes with the Pope have a certain conspiracion and secret treason
agenst the whole world. And by confession know they what kings and Emperors
think. If ought be agenst them / do they never so evyll / then move they
their captives to war and to fight and geve them pardons to sley whom they
will have taken out of the way. They have with falsheed taken from all kings
and emperous their right and duties / which now they call their fredomes
lyberties and priveleges and have perverted the ordinances that god left in
the world / and have made every Kings be sworn to the bisshopes and not the
bisshopes unto the kings.
king swear to defend their falsheed agenst their awn selves. So that now if
any man preach Gods word truly and show the fredome and liberty of the soul
which we have in Christ / or entende to restore the kings again unto their
duties and right and to the rowme and auctorite which they have of God / and of
shadows to make them kings in dead / and to put the world in his order
again: the^ ye kings delyver their swerdes and auctorite unto ye ypocrites to
sley him So dro^ke^ are they with ye wine of ye whore. The text that follows
in Paul will they happly lay to my charge and others. How shall they preach
except they be sent is expounded.
How shall they preach except they be sent / says Paul in the said.x. to the
Romans. We / will they say / are the Pope / Cardinals and Bisshopes all
auctorite is ours. The scripture perteyneth unto us and is our possession And
we have a law / that whosoever presume to preach without the auctorite of ye
bisshopes is excommunicate in the dead doing. Whense therefore have thou thine
auctorite will they say. The old pharisees had ye scripture in captivite like
wise / and axed christ by what auctorite doist thou these things? as who
should say. We are pharisees and thou art none of our order nor have auctorite
of us Christ axed them a another question and so will I do our ypocrites. Who
sent you? God? Nay he yt is send of God / speaks Gods word John. iij. How
to know who is sent of god and who is not.
Now speak ye not Gods word / ner any thing save your own laws made clean
contrary unto Gods word Christ's apostles preached Christ and not them selves.
He that is of the truth / preaches the truth. Now ye preach no thing but
lies / and therefore are of the devyll the father of al lies and of him are ye
sent. And as for mine auctorite or who sent me. I report me unto my works as
Christ John the fyft and also tenth chapter. If Gods word bear record that I
say troth / why should any man doubt / but that God / the father of truth and
of light has sent me as the father of lies and of darkness has sent you /
and that the spirit of truth and of light is with me / as the sprite of lies
and of darkness is with you? By this means thou will that every man be a
preacher will they say No man may preach but he that y^ called and sent of God.
Nay verily. For God will that not and therefore will I it not / no moare then
I would that every man of London were mayre of London / or every man of the
realm king thereof.
God is not the auctor of dissension and strife / but of unite and peace and of
good order. I will therefore that where a congregation is gathered to gether in
Christ one be chosen after the rule of Paul / and that he only preach / and
else no man openly: but that every man teach his household after the same
doctrine. But if the preacher preach false: the^ whosoevers heart God moves /
to the same it shall be lawful to rebuke and improve the false teacher with the
clear and manifest scripture / and that same is no doubt a true prophet sent
of God. For the scripture is Gods and there is that beleve and not the false
prophets.

Sacrament is than as much to say as an holy sign. And the sacraments which
Christ ordened preach Gods word unto us and therefore justify and minister the
sprite to them that beleve / as Paul through preachi^ge the Gospel was a
minister of righteousness and of the sprite unto all that beleved his
preachinge. Dome ceremonies are no sacraments / but superstitiousnes. Christ's
sacraments preach the faith of Christ as his apostles did and thereby justify.
Antichrists dome ceremonies preach not the faith that is in Christ / as his
Apostles our misshapes and cardinals do not. But as Antychristes bisshapes are
ordained to kill who so ever preach the true faith of Christ so are his
ceremonies ordained to quench the faith which Christ's sacraments preach. The
difference between true sacramen^es and false.
And hereby may thou know the difference between Christ's signs or
sacraments and Antichrists signs or ceremonies / that Christ's signs speak
and a^tichristes be dome

Here by seist thou what is to be thought of all other ceremonies / as holowed
water / bred / salt / bows / belles / wax / ashes and so forth / and all
other disgisinges and apesplaye and of all manner coniuracions / as the
coniuringe of church and church yardes and of alter stones and soch like. where
no promise of God is / there ca^ be no faith ner iustifienge / ner forgevenes
of sins* For it is moare then madness to look for any thing of God save that
he has promised. How fer he has promised so fer is he bound to them that
beleve and forther not. A faith without gods promise is ydolatrie:
To have a faith therefore or a trust in any thing / where God has not
promised is plain ydolatrye and a worshepinge of thine own imaginacion instead of God. Let us se the pith of a ceremonye or two to judge the rest by In
coniuringe of holy water they pray / that whosoever be sprinkled there with
may receave health as well of body as of soul / and like wise in making holy
bred and so forth in the coniuracio^s of other ceremonies. Now we se by daily
experiens that half there prayer is vnherde. For no man receaveth health of
body thereby. No moare of lykelyhode do they of soul. Ye we se also by
experiens that no man receaveth health of soul thereby. For no man by
sprynkelinge himself with holy water and with eatinge holy bred / is moare
merciful then before / or forgeveth wrong / or becomes at one with his enemy
/ or is moare paciente and less covetous and so forth. Which are the sure
tokens of the soull health

They preach also that the wagginge of the Bisshopes hand over us blesses us
and puts away our sins. The bisshop^ blessing.
Are these works not agenst Christ? How can they do moare shame unto Christ's
blood? For if the wagginge of the Bisshopes hand over me be so precious a
thing in the syghte of God that I am thereby blessed / how the^ am I full
blessed with all spiritual blessinge in Christ as Paul says Ephe. j. Or if
my sins be full done away in Christ / how remains there any to be done
away by soch fantasies? The Apostles knew no ways to put a way sin or to
bless us but by preachinge Christ. How the postels blessed ^s.
Paul says Galat. ij. if righteousness come by the law / then Christ died in
vain. So dispute I here. If blessing come by the wagginge of the misshapes
hand / then died Christ in vain and his deeth blessed us not. And a little
before / says Paul / if while we seek to be justified by Christ we be found
yet sinners (so yt we must be justified by the law or ceremoni^s) is not
Christ the^ a mynister of sin? So dispute I here. If while we seek to be
blessed in Christ we are yet unblessed and must be blessed by the wagginge of
the bis^hapes hand / what have we then of Christ but curse? Thou will say.
When we come first to the faith / then Christ forgeveth us and blesses us.
But the sins which we afterward commit are forgeven us through soch
things. I answer: If any man repent truly and come to the faith and put his
trust in Christ / then as often as he synneth of frayl^e / at the sygh of the
heart is his sin put away in Christ's blood. For cristes blood purge^^
ever and blesses ever. For Iho^ says i^ ye s^^o^de of his first epistle.

This I writ unto you yt ye sin not. And though any ^an sin (meaning of
fraylte and so rep^nte) yet have we an advocate with the father / Jesus Christ
which is righteo^s / and ^e it is yt obteyneth grace for our sins and Heb.
vij. it is written. But this man (meaning Christ) because he lasts or
abides ever / has an everlastinge presthode Therefore is he able also ever to
save the^ that come to god through hi^ sei^ge he ever lives to make
intercession for us. The Bisshopes therefore ought to bless us in preachinge
Christ and not to deceave us and to bring the curse of God upon us with
wagginge their hands over us. To preach is their duty only and not to offer
their fete to be kyssed or testicles or stones to be groped. We feale also by
experience that after the Popes / Bisshopes or Cardinals blessinge we are no
other wise disposed in our souls then before.

Let this be sufficient as concerning the sacraments and ceremonies / The
protestacion of the auctor.
with this protestacion / that if any can say better or improve this with Gods
word / no man shall be better content there with then I. For I seek no thing
but the troth and to walk in the light. I submitt therefore this work and all
other that I have made or shall make (if God will that I shall moare make) unto
the judgments / not of them that furiously burn all truth / but of them
which are ready with Gods word to correct / if any thing be said amiss / and
to further Gods word.

Confession robs the sacraments and ma^e them frutlesse^
I Will talk a word or two after ye wordly wisdom wih them and make an end
of this matter. If ye sacraments justify / as they say / I understood by
iustifienge forgevenes of sins. Then do they wrong unto the sacraments /
in as much as they rob the most part of them through confession of their
effect and of the cause wherefore they were ordained. For no man may receave
ye body of Christ / no man may marye / no man may be oyled or an eled as they
call it / no man may receave orders / except he be first shreve^. Now when
the sins be forgeve^ by shreft before hand / there is naught left for ye
sacraments to do. They will answer / yt at the lest way they encreace grace
/ and not ye sacraments only / but also heari^ge of mass / mate^s and
evensonge / and receavinge of holy water / holy bred and of the Bisshopes
blessinge and so forth by all ye ceremonies. What grace i^
By grace I understood ye favor of God and also the gifts and worki^ge of
his sprite in us / as love kyndnes / patience / obedience / mercyfulnes /
despisynge of worldly things / peace / co^corde and soch like. How to know
what justifies and what not or what brings graand what not.
If after thou have herd so many masses / mate^s and eve^songe and after thou
have received holy bred / holy water and the bisshopes blessinge or a cardinals
or ye popes / if thou will / thou be moare k^de to thy neyboure and love hi^
better the^ before / if thou be moare obedie^te unto thy superiors / moare
merciful / moare ready to forgeve wrong done unto ye / moare despisest ye
world and moare a thurst after spritual things if after yt a pressed has take
orders he be less covetous the^ before: if a wife after so many and often
pylgremages be moare chaste / moare obediente unto her hus^ande / more kind to
her maids and other servauntes: If gentle men / knights / lords / and
kings and Emperors / after they have said so often daily service with their
^ith their chapellayns quod ^e God geve grace their chapellayn ^ at the last
make the^ not so mad to say service alone while they.
chapellaines know moare of Christ then before and can better skyll to rule
their tenauntes / subjects and realms christenly then before and be content
with their duties / then do soch things encreace grace / if not / it is a lie.
whether it be so or no I report me to experience. If they have any other
enterpretations of iustifienge or grace I pray them to teach it me. For I would
gladly learn it. Now late us goo to our purpose again

Gf miracles and worsheppinge of saints.
ANtichriste shall not only come with lyenge signs and disgised with falshed
but also with lyenge miracles and wonders / says Paul in the said place. ij.
Thessa. ij. True miracles draw to christ.
All the true miracles which are of god / are showed (as I above rehearsed) to
move us to here Gods word and to stablish our faith therein and to confirm the
truth of Gods promises / that we might with out all doutynge beleve the^* For
Gods word through faith brings the spri^te in to our hertes and also life /
as Chiist says Ihon. vj. the words which I speak are sprite and life. The
word also purges us and cleanses us / as Christ says John. xv. ye are clean
by the means of the word. Paul says.j. Timoth. ij. One God / one mediator
(that is to say / advocate / intercessor / or an atonemaker) between God and
man the man Christ Jesus which gave hi^ self a raunson for all me^ Peter
says of Christ Act. iiij. Nether is there health in any other: nether yet also
any other name geve^ unto me^ wherein we must be saved. So now Christ is our
peace our rede^p^io^ or raunson for our sins / our righteousness /
satisfaction and all the promyses of God are ye and Ame^ in him.ij. Cor. j.
And we for the great and infinite love which God has to us in Christ ^ love
him again love also his laws and love one a another / And ye deades which we
he^ceforth do / do we not to make satisfaction or to obtain heve^: but to
succor our neyboure to tame the flesh that we may wax perfect and strong
me^ in christ and to be thankful to God again for his mercy / and to
glorify his name*

COntrary wise the miracles of Antichrist are done to pull the from ye word of
God and from belevinge his promyses and from Christ and to put thy trust in a
man or a ceremony wherein Gods word is not. False miracles dryve from ch^iste.
As soon as Gods word is beleved ye faith spread abroad the^ sease ye miracles
of god But the miracles of Antichrist / because they are wrought by the devyll
/ to quench the faith / grow daily moare and moare: nether shall cease until
the worlds end among them that beleve not Gods word and promyses. Seist
thou not how God loosed and send forth all the devyls in the old world
among the hethen or gentyls? And how the devyls wrought miracles and spoke to
them in every image? Even so shall the devyll work falsheed by one craft or a
another until ye worlds end among them that beleve not Gods word. For the
judgment and damnation of him that has no lust to hear the troth / is to
hearelyes and to be stablyshed and grounded therein through false miracles / and
he that will not se / is worthy to be blind and he that byddeth the sprite of
God goo from him is worthy to be without him.

Paul / Peter / and all true Apostles preached Christ only. And the miracles
did but confirm and stablysh their preachinge and those everlastinge promises
and eternal testamente that God had made between man and him in Christ's
blood / and the miracles did testify also that they were true servauntes of
Christ. Paul preached not hi^ self ^ he taught not any man to trust in him or
his holiness or in Peter or in any ceremony but in the promyses which God has
sworn only / ye he mightylie resists all soch false doctrine both to the
Corinthia^s / Galathiens / Ephesians and everywhere. He that teaches to trust
in a saint is a false prophet.
If this be true (as it is true and nothing moare truer) that if Paul had
preached him selve or taught any man to beleve in his holiness or prayer or in
any thing / save in the promyses that God has made and sworn to geve us for
Christ's sake / he had been a false prophet ^ why am not I also a false
prophet / if I teach the to trust in Paul or i^ his holiness or prayer / or in
any thing save in Gods word as Paul did.

If Paul were here and loved me (as he loved the^ of his time to whom he was
sent and to whom he was a servaunte to preach Christ / What he should pray
that prays for his neyboure.
what good could he do for me or wish me / but preach Christ and pray to God
for me / to open mine heart / to geve me his sprite and to bring me unto the
full knowleage of Christ? unto which port or haven / when I am once come / I
am as safe as Paul / fellow with Paul / ioyn their with Paul of all the
promyses of God and Gods truth bears my prayer as well as Paul's I also now
could not but love Paul and wish him good / and pray for him / that God would
strength him in all his temptations and geve him victory / as he would do for
me. The wea^e should be taught and not deceaved.
Never the less there are many weak / and young consciences all ways in the
congregation which they that have the office to preach ought to teach and not
to disceave them.

The spiritualte pray not that we might come to the knowledge of christ.
What prayers pray our clergy for us which stop us and exclude us from
Christ and seek all the means possible to keep us from knowleage of Christ.
They compel us to hyre freres / monks / nuns / chanons / and prestes / and
to by their abominable merits / and to hyre the saints that are deed to
pray for us / for the very saints have they made hyrclynges also: because
that their offeringes come to their profit. What pray all those? that we might
come to the knowleage of Christ / as the postels did? Nay verily. For it is a
plain case / that all they which enforce to keep us from Christ / pray not
that we might come to the knowledge of Christ. And as for the saints (whose
prayer was when they were a lyve that we might be grounded / stablyshed and
strenghted in Christ only) if it were of God that we should this wise worship
them contrary unto their awn doctrine / I dare be bold to affirm that by the
means of their prayers we should have been brought long a goo unto the
knowledge of God and Christ again / though that these beestes had done their
worste to let it. Late us therefore set our hertes at rest in Christ and in
Gods promyses / for so I think it best / and let us take the saints for an
example only and let us do as they both taught and did. The sa^tes are but an
ensample.


Let us set Gods promyses before our eyes / and desire him for his mercy and
for Christ's sake to fulfill them. And he is as true as ever he was / and will
do it ^ (...) well as ever he did. for to us are (...) made as well as to them.

Moare over the end of Gods miracles is good / the end of these miracles are
evyll. For the offeringes which are the cause of the miracles do but mynister
and mayntene vice / Offerynges cause the miracles.
sin and all abomination / and are geven to the^ that have to much so that
for very abundance / they foam out their awn shame and corrupt the whole
world with the stench of their filthynes

Thereto what so ever is not of faith is sin / Romanorum. xiiij. Faith comes
by heringe Gods word Roma. x. When now thou fastest or do any thing in the
worshepe of any saint belevinge to come to the favor of God or to be saved
thereby if thou have Gods word / then is it true faith and shall save the. If
thou have not Gods word / then is it a falls faith superstitiousnes and
ydolatry and damnable sin.

Also in the collectes of the sai^tes with which we pray God to save us through
the mentes or deservinges off the Saints (which saints yet were not saved by
there own deservinges them selves) we say Per Christum dominum nostrum / that
is for christ our lords sake. We say save us good lord through the saints
merits for Christ's sake. How ca^ he save us through the saints merits for
Christ's sake and for his deservinge merits and love? Take an example. A
gentill man says unto me I will do the vttemost of my power for the / for the
love which I owe unto thy father. Though thou have never done me pleasure / yet
I love thy father well / thy father is my friend and has deserved that I do
all that I can for the etc. Here is a testamente and a promise made unto me in
the love of my father only. If I come to the said gentill man in the name of
one of his servau^tes which I never saw never spoke with nether have any
accoyntaunce at all with and say: Sir I pray you be good master unto me in
soch a cause. I have not deserved that ye should so do. Never the less I
pray you do it for soch a servauntes sake: ye I pray you for the love that
you owe to my father do that for me for soch a servauntes sake. If I this wise
made my peticion / would not men think that I come late out of Saint Patrikes
purgatory / and had left my wits behind me. This do we. For the testamente
and promyses are all made unto us in Christ. And we desire God to fulfill his
promises for the saints sake ye that he will for Christ's sake do it for the
saints sake.

They have also marters which never preached Gods word nether died therefore:
All soch marters are the p^pes marters and no^ Gods For mart^^ signifies a
wit^nes ^erar: now is he not gods w^ttenes that testifies not his word.
but for preveleges and lyberties which they falsely purchesed contrary unto
Gods ordinances Ye and soch saints though they be deed / yet rob now as
fast as ever they did nether are less covetous now then when they were a lyve.
I doubt not but that they will make a saint of my lord Cardinal after the
deeth of us that be a lyve and know his iugglinge and crafty conveyaunce and
will shrine him gloriously / for his myghtyly defendinge of the right of holy
church / except we be diligente to leave a co^memoracion of that Nimroth
behind us.

The reasons where with they prove their doctrine are but fleshly and as Paul
calls them / The reasons which they make for the worshepi^ge of saints are
solved.
entysinge words of man's wisdom / that is to wete / sophistry and blawlinge
arguments of men with corrupt minds and destitute of the troth / whose God
is their belly / unto which ydole whosoever offers not / the same is an
herytike / and worthy to be brunte.

The saint was great with God when he was a lyve / as it appears by the
miracles which God showed for hi^ / he must therefore he great now say they.
This reason appears wisdom / but is very folyshnes with God
For ye miracle was not showed that thou should put thy trust in the saint /
but in the word which the saint preached / which word if thou belevedest it
/ would save y^ / as god has promised and sworn / and would make y^ also
great with God / as it did the saint.

If a man have a matter with a great man or a king / he must goo first unto
one of his mean servauntes and then hier and hier till he come at the king.
This enrysynge argument is but a blind reason of man's wit It is not like in
the kyngdyme of the world and in the kingdom of God and christ.

It is not like with kings and God.
With kings for the most part we have none accoyntaunce nether promise. They
be also most comenly mercylesse. Moare over if they promise / they are yet men
as vnco^stante as are other people and as untrue. But with god / if we have
belefe / we are acomted and have an open way in unto him by the door Christ
which is never shutt but through unbelief / nether is there any porter to keep
any man out. By him says Poul Ephe. ij. that is to say / by christ we have
an open way in unto the father. So are ye now no moare strangers and forenars
(says he) but cetysens with the saints and of the household of God. God has
also made us promyses and has sworn: ye has made a testamente or a covenant
and has bound him self and has sealed his obligacio^ with Christ's blood
and confirmed it with miracles. He is also merciful and kind / and
complayneth that we will not come unto hi^ He is mighty and able to perform
that he promises. He is true and can not be but true / as he can not be but
God. Therefore is it not like with the king and God.

We be sinners say they / God will not hear us. Behold how they fle from god
as from a tyraunte mercylesse. Whom a man counts most merciful unto him he
sonest flees. But these teachers dare not come at God. Why? For they are the
childern of cayn. If the saints love whom god hates / then God and his
saints are divided. When thou prayest to the saints / how do they know /
except that god / whom thou countest mercylesse / tell them? If god be so
cruel and so hates the it is not lykely that he will tell the saints that
thou prayest unto them.

When they say we be sinners: Christ is no sinner*
I answer / that Christ is no sinner / save a satisfaction / and an offeringe
for sin. Take Christ from the saints and what are they? What is Paul without
Christ? is he any thing save a blasphemer / a persecuter / a murderer / and a
sheder of Christen blood?

But as soon as he came to christ he was no moare a si^ner but a mnister of
righteousness he went / not to Rome to take penance apo^ him / but went and
preached unto his brethern the same mercy which he had received fre / without
doing penance or hyringe of saints or of monks or freres. Moare over if it
be Gods word that thou should put thy trust in the saints merits or prayers /
then be bold* For Gods word shall defend the and save the. If it be but thine
own reason / then fear. For God commands by Moses Deuteronomion. xij.
saying: what I command you that observe and do / and put no thing to / ner
take ought therfro: ye and Moses warns straytly in an hundred places that
we do that only which God commands and which seems good and righteous in
his sight and not in our own sight. For nothing brings the wrath of god
so sone and so sore on a man / as the ydolatry of his own imagination.

Last of al these arguments are contrary to the arguments of Christ and of his
apostles. Christ disputes Luke. xj* saye^ge: if the son axe the father bred
/ will he geve him a stone? or if he ask him fysh / will he geve him a
serpe^te? and so forth. If ye then (says he) which are evell can geve good
gifts to your childerne / how much rather shall your heve^ly father geve a
good sprite unto the^ that ask him? And a little before in the same chapter he
says. If a man came never s^ out of season to his neyboure to borowe bred:
even when he is in his chamber and the door shett / and all his servauntes with
him. Never the less yet if he continue knocking and prayenge / he will rise
and geve him as much as he neadeth / though not for love / yet to be rydd of
him that he may have rest: As who should say / what will god do if a man
pray him: seeing that prayer over comes an evyll man? Ask therefore (says
he) and it shall be geven you / seek and ye shall find / knock and it shall be
opened unto you. And Luke. xviij. he puts forth the parable or similitude of
the weked judge which was overcome with the importune prayer of the wedowe. And
concludes saying: Hear what the wicked judge did. And shall not God avenge
his elect which cry unto him night and day? Whether therefore we compain of
the intolerable oppression and persecucio^ yt we sofre / or of ye flesh yt
co^breth and resists ye sprite / God is merciful to hear us and to help
us. Seist thou not also how Christ cures many and casts out devyls out of
many unspoken to / how shall he not help / if he be desired and spoken to?

When the old phareses / whose nature is to dryve sinners from Christ / asked
Christ why he did eat with publicanes and sinners. Christ answered that the
whole neaded not the physician but the sick. That is / Christ is a gift geve^
to sinners.
he came to have conversacion with sinners to heal them* He was a gift geve^
unto sinners / and a treasoure to pay their dettes. And Christ sent ye
co^playninge and disdayning phareses to the prophet God loves mercy.
Oseas saye^ge / goo and learn what this means / I desire or require mercy
and not sacrifice. As who should say / ye phareses love sacrifice and Ipocrites
love offerynges
offeringe for to feed that God your belyes with all / but God commands to
be merciful. Sinners are ever captives and a pray unto the phareses and
ypocrites / for to offer unto their belies / and to bye merytes / pardons and
forgevenes of sins of them And therefore fear they them away from Christ
with arguments of their belly wisdom. For he that receaveth forgevenes free of
Christ will by no forgevenes of them. I came (says Christ) to call / not ye
rightwes / but the sinners unto repentance. The phareses are righteous and
therefore have no part with Christ / nether neade they. For they are gods the^
self and savars. But sinners yt repe^te pertayne to Christ. If we repent /
Christ has made satisfaccion for us all ready.

God so loved the world / that he gave his only son / that none that beleve
on him should peresh / but should have everlastinge lyve. For God sent not his
son in to the world / to condemn the world / but that the world through
him might be saved. He that beleveth on him shall not be damned / but he that
beleveth not he is damned all ready. John. iij.

Paul. To. v. says. Be cause we are justified through faith / we are at peace
with god through our lord Jesus Christ / yt is / because that God / which can
not lie / has promised and sworn to be merciful unto us and to forgeve us
for Christ's sake / we beleve and are at peace in our consciences / we run
not hither and thither for pardon / we trust not in this friar ner that monk
nether in any thing save in the word of God only. As a child when his father
threatens him for his fault / has never rest / till he hear the word of
mercy and forgevenes of his fathers mouth again / but as soon as he hears
his father say / goo thy ways / do me no moare so / I forgeve the this fault
/ then is his heart at rest / the^ is he at peace / then runs he to no man to
make intercession for him. Nether though there come any false marchaunde saying
/ what will thou geve me and I will obtain pardon of thy father for ye / will
he sofre hi^ self to be begiled / no he will not bye of a wily fox that which
his father has geve^ him freely.

It follows. god sets out his love yt he has to us / yt is / he makes it
appear / yt me^ may perceave love / if they be not moare the^ stock blind. In
as much says Paul as while we were yet sinners / Christ died for us. Much
moare now / says he (saying we are justified by his blood) shall we be
preserved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies we were reconsyled
to God by the deeth of his son: much moare saying we are reconsiled / we
shall be preserved by his life. As who should say / if God loved us when we knew
him not / much moare loves he us now we know him. If he were merciful unto us
while we hated his law / much moare merciful will he be now / saying we love
it and desire strngth to fulfill it. And in the.viij. he argues. If God spared
not his own son but gave him for us all / how shall he not with hi^ geve us
all things also?

Christ prayed John. xvij. not for ye Apostles only / but also for as many as
should beleve through their preachi^ge and was herd / what so ever we ask in
his name ye father geveth us Io. xvj. Christ is also as merciful as ye
sai^tes. Why we come not to Christ.
Why goo we not streght way unto hi^? Verily because we feale not ye mercy of
god nether beleve his troth. God will at ye lest way (say they) hear us ye
sooner for ye saints sake. The^ loves he the saint better the^ Christ and
his own truth. Hears he us for the saints sake? so hears he us not for
his mercy. For merits and mercy can not stand together.

Finally if thou put any trust in thine own deades or in the deades of any
other man of any saint / the^ mynishist thou the troth mercy and goodness of
God. For if God look unto thy works or unto the works of any other man or
goodness of the saint: the^ does not he all things of pure mercy and of his
goodness and for the truethes sake which he has sworn in Christ. Now says
Paul in the last to Titus. Not of the righteous deades which we did: but of his
mercy saved he us.

Our blind disputers will say / if our god deades justify us not / if God
look not on our good deades nether regard the^ ner love us ye better for the^
what neade we to do good deades? God looks on our good deades.
I answer God looks on our good deades and loves them / yet loves us not
for their sakes. God loves us first in Christ of his goodness and mercy / and
powers his sprite in to us / and geveth us power to do good deades. And
because he loves us / he loves our good deades: ye because he loves us / he
forgeveth us our evyll deades which we do of fraylte and not of purpose or for
the nonce. Our good deades do but testyfie only that we are justified and
beloved. For except we were beloved and had Gods sprite we could nether do
ner yet consent unto any good dead. Antychriste turns the rote^ of the tree
up Ward.
Antichrist turns the rotes of the trees upward He makes the goodness of God
the branches and our goodness the rotes. We must be first good after
Antichrists doctrine / and move God and compel him to be good again for our
goodnesses sake: so most Gods goodness spring out of our goodness. Nay verily
Gods goodness is ye rote of all goodness and our goodness / if we have any /
springs out of his goodness.

Prayer.
OF prayer and good deades and of the order of love or charity I have
habundantly written in my book of the iustifyenge of faith. Never the later
that thou may se what the prayers and good works of our monks and freres
and of other goostly people are worth / I will speak a word or two and make
an end. Paul says Gal. iij. All ye are ye sons of God through faith in Jesus
Christ. For all ye that are baptized have put Christ on you (that is ye are
become Christ hi^ self) There is no Jew (says he) nether greek: nether bo^de
ner fre: nether man ner woman: but ye are all In christ we are one as good as
a another equaly beloved and indifferently hearde^
one thing in Christ Jesus. In Christ there is nether french ner english: but
the frenchman is the englishmans own self / and the english the frenchmans
own self. In Christ there is nether father / ner son: nether master: ner
servant: nether husband / ner wife: nether king / ner subject: but the
father is the sons self and the son the fathers own self / and the king
is the subjects own self / and the subject is the kings own self / and
so forth. I am thou thy self and thou art I my self and can be no nere of
kynne. We are all the sons of God all Christ's servauntes bought with his
blood and every man to other Christ his own self. And Collo. iij. Ye have
put on the new man which is renewed in the knowleage of God after the image of
him that made him (that is to say Christ) where is (says he) nether greek
ner Jew / circuncision ner vncircuncision / barbarous or sythian / bond or
fre: but Christ is all to a christian man.
Christ is all in all things. I love the not now because thou art my father
and have done so much for me or my mother and have borne me and geven me suck
of thy breasts (for so do Iew^s and saracenes) but because of the great love
that Christ has showed me. I serve the not be cause thou art my master or my
king / for hope of reward or fear of pain / but for the love of Christ.
For ye childerne of faith are under no law (as thou seist in the Pistles to
the Romans to the Galathians / in the first to Timoth. but are fre. The
childern of faith work of love and need no law to compel the^.
The sprite of Christ has written the lively law of love i^ their hertes
which drives the^ to work of their own accord freely and willingly / for the
great loves sake only which they se in Christ / and therefore need they no
law to compel them. Christ is all in all things to them that beleve / and
the cause of all love. We are all christ^s servauntes and ^arve Christ.
Paul says (Ephesians. vj.) servau^tes obey unto your carnal or fleshly masters
with fear and tremblinge / in singlenes of your hertes as unto Christ? not
with eye service as men pleasers: but as the serva^tes of Christ: doing the
will of God from the heart: even as though ye served the lord and not men. And
remember that what so ever good thing any man does / that shall he receave
again of the lord / whether he be bond or fre. Christ thus is all in all
things and cause of all to a Christen man. And Math. xxv says Christ: in as
much as ye have done it to any of ye lest of these my brethren / ye have done
it to me. And i^ as much as ye have not done it unto one of the lest of these /
ye have not done it to me. Here seist thou yt we are Christ's brethern and even
Christ him self / and what so ever we do one to a another that do we to
Christ. If we be in Christ we work for no wordly purpose / but of love. As
Paul says.ij. Corint. v. The love of Christ compelled us (as who should say we
work not of a flesly purpose) For (says he) we know hensforth no man flesly:
no though we once knew christ fleshly we do so now no moare. We are other wise
minded / then when Peter drew his sword to fight for Christ. we are now
ready to sofre with Christ and to loose life and all for our very enemies to
bring them to Christ. If we be in Christ we are minded like unto Christ /
Christ knows no thing worldly no not his very mother.
which knew no thing flesly or after the will of the flesh / as thou seist
Matthew. xij. when one said to him. Loo thy mother and thy brethern sto^de
without desyringe to speak with the. He answered / who is my mother and who
are my brethren? And stretched his hand over his disciples saying: se my
mother and my brethren. For who so ever does ye will of my father which is in
heve^ / the same is my brother my sister and my mother. He knew not his mother
in that she bare him / but in that she did the will of his father in heven. So
now as God the fathers will and co^maundme^t is all to Christ even so Christ is
all to a Christen man.

Christ is the cause why I love the why I am ready to do the uttermost of my
power for the / and why I pray for the And as long as the cause abides / so
long lesteth the effect even as it is all way day / so long as the sone
shyneth. Do therefore the worst thou can unto me: take away my goods: take
away my good name: yet as long as As long as christ abides so long a
christian man loves.
Christ remains in mine heart / so long I love the not a whit the less and
so long art thou as dear unto me as mine own soul / and so long am I ready
to do the good for thine evyll and so long I pray for the with all mine
heart. For Christ desires it of me and has deserved it of me. Thine
unkindness compared unto his kyndnes is nothi^ge at all / ye it is swalowed up /
as a little smoke of a mighty wind / and is no moare seen or thought apo^
Moare over that evyll which thou doist to me / I receave not of thine hand /
but of the hand of God / and as Gods scorge to teach me patience and to
nurtoure me. And therefore have no cause to be angry with the moare then the
child has to be anger with his fathers rod or a sick man with a sour or
bitter medicine that heals him / or a prisoner with his fetters or he that is
punished lawfully with the officer that punishes him. Thus is Christ all and
the whole cause why I love the / And to all ca^ naught be added Therefore can

able I will do the service freely / if not / then if thou ministre to me again

all and Christ bought all with his blood / therefore ought all to seek God and
Christ in all and else no thing.

But contrary wise unto monks / freres / and to the other of our holy
spiritualte the belly is all i^ all and cause of all love. The belly is a God and
cause of all unto our spiritualte.

then for them that geve us not. For them that geve little are they little bound

them they love much. And for them that geve naught are they naught bound and
them they love not at all. And as they love the when thou gevist: so hate they
the when thou take away from them / and run all under a stole and curse

Christ.

forgets her self and bestows her upon her neybours profit as Christ
sought our profit and not his own. He sought not the favor of God for him
self / but for us ye ^e took the wrath and vengeance of God from us unto him
self and bare it on his own back to bring us unto favor. Like wise does
a Christian man geve to his brethern and robs them not as freres and monks
do: But as Paul cammaundeth Ephe iiij. labors with his hands some good
work to have where with to help the neady They geve not but receave only.
They labor not but lyve ydely of the swet of the pore. There is none so pore
a wedow / though she have not to find her self and her childern ner any money
to geve: yet shall ye friar snach a chese or some what. They preach / say
thou and labor in ye word. Freres and monks ought not to preach.
First I say they are not called and therefore ought not: for it is the curates
office. The curate can not seyst thou. What does the thief there the^?
Seco^daryly a true preacher preaches christ's testamente only and makes
christ the cause and reward of all our deades and teaches every man to
bear his cross willingly for christ's sake: But these are enemies unto the
cross of christ and preach their belly which is their God Ephe. iij. and they
think that lucre is the servinge of God.j. Timo. vj. that is / they think
them christian only which offer unto their belyes / which when thou have filled
then spue they out prayers for the / to be thy reward / and yet wott not what
prayer means. Prayer is the longinge for Gods promises / which promises as
they preach them not so long they not for the^ ner wish the^ unto any man.
Their lo^ginge is to fill their ^anch whom they serve and not Christ and through
sweet preachinge and flatteringe words deceave the hertes of the simple and
unlearned. Roma. xvj.

Finally as Christ is the whole cause why we do all thing for our neyboure /
Christ is the whole cause why God loves us.
even so is he the cause why god does all thing for us / why he receaveth us
in to his holy testame^te and makes us heirs of all his promyses / and
powers his sprite in to us / and makes ^s his sons / and fascioneth us like
unto Christ and makes us soch as he would have us to be How to know that we are Gods sons.
The assurance that we are sons / beloved and heirs with Christ and have
Gods sprite in us / is the consent of our hertes unto the law of God. Which
law is all perfeccion and the mark where at all we ought to shote. The law is
the m^^ke: ye and the ^wich ^^o^ where wit^ we ough^e to try our selv^s and
se how f^r^or^h we are purged.
And he that hitteth that mark / so that he fulfilleth the law with all his
heart soul and might and with full love and lust without all let or
resistaunce is pure gold and neadeth not to be put any moare in the fire: he
is streghte and right and neadeth to be no moare shaven: he is full fascioned
like Christ and can have no moare added unto him. Never thelesse there is none
so perfect in this life that fyndeth not let and resistaunce by the reason of
original sin or birth poison that remains in him / as thou may se in ye
lyves of all the saints through out all the scripture and in Paul To. vij. The
will is present / says he / but I find no means to perform yt which is
good I do not that good thing which I would: but that evyll do I which I
would not. I fi^de by ye law yt when I would do good / evyll is present with
me. I delyte^n ye law / as co^cerni^ge the inner man / but I fi^de a another law
i^ my me^bres rebellinge age^ste ye law of mi mi^de and subdui^ge me unto ye
law of si^ne.
Which law of si^ne is nothi^ge but a corrupt and a poyesoned nature which
breaks in to evyll lusts and from evil lusts in to weaked deades and must
be purged with the true purgatory of the cross of christ: The right cross
of christ
yt is thou must hate it with all thine heart and desire god to take it from
ye. And the^ what so ever cross God puts on thy back bear it patiently
whether it be poverte sycknes or persecucion or what so ever it be / and take
it for the right purgatory and think that God has nailed the fast to it / to
purge ye thereby He that loves not the law and ha^eth syn has no part with
christ.
For he that loves not the law and hates his sin and has not professed in
his heart to fight agenst it and morneth not to God to take it away and to
purge him of it / the same has no part with christ How to try the doctrine
of our spir^^ualte.
If thou love the law and fyndest that thou have yet sin ha^gi^ge on ye /
where of thou sorowest to be delyvered and purged as for an example / thou have
a covetous mi^de and mistrustest god and therefore art moved to begyle thy
neyboure and art unto hi^ mercylesse / not caringe whether he sink or swym so
thou may win by him or get from hi^ yt he has: the^ get y^ to the
observau^te which is so purged from yt sin that he will not once handle a penny
and with yt wyle does y^ sotle fox make ye gose come flyenge in to his hole
ready prepared for his mouth with out his labor or swet and bie of his
merits which he has i^store and geve thy money not in to his holy hands but
to of him yt he has hired ^ther with part of his prayers or part of his
pray to take ye sin upon him and to handle his money for hi^. In like manner
if any parson that is under obedience unto Gods ordinance (whether it be son
or doghter / servaunte / wife or subject) consent unto the ordinance / and
yet find contrary mocions: let him goo also to them that have professed an
obedience of their own making / and bye part of their merits. If thy wife
geve the.ix. words for three / goo to the charterhowse and bye of their silence
and so If the praya^s and merits of our religious purge our lusts the^ are
they of valve and else not
If the abstenynge of the observaunt from handlynge money heal thine heart
from desyringe money / and the obedience of them that will obey no thing but
their own ordinance / heal thy disobedience to Gods ordinance / and the
syle^ce of the charterhouse monk tame thy wyves tongue: then beleve that their
prayers shall deliver thy soul from the pains of that terreble and fearful
purgatory which they have feigned to purge thy purse with all.

The spiritualte increases daily. Moo prelates moo prestes /
moo monks / freres / chanons / nu^nes and moo heretics / I would say
heremytes with like draffe / Set before the the increase of saint Fraunces
disciples in so few years. Reke^ how many thousa^de. ye how many twenty
thousands / not discyples only: but whole cloisters are spronge out of hell of
them in so little space. Pateringe of prayers increases daily. Their service as
they call it / waxes longer and longer and the labor of their lyppes greater
/ new saints / new service / new festes and new holy days. What take all
these away? Sin? Nay. For we se the contrary by experience and that sin
grows as they grow. But they take away first gods word with faith / hope /
peace / unite / love and concord then house and lord / rent and fee / toure
and town / goods and cattle / and ye very meat out of men's mouths. What
the spiritualte takes away with their prayers*
All these lyve by purgatory. When other weep they sing and when other loose
they win.
When other weep for their fre^des they singe merrily when other loose their
friends they get fre^des. The pope with all his pardons is grounded on
purgatory. Prestes monks / chanons / freres with all other swermes of
ypocrites do but empty purgatory and fill hell. Every mass / say they /
delyvereth one soul out of All is of purgatory. The^ phisicions geve no other
medicines save purgation^ only*
purgatory. If that were true / ye if ten masses were ynow for one soul / yet
were the parish prestes and curates of every parysh sufficient to scour
purgatory. All ye other costly work me^ might be well spared:

The.iiij. senses of ye scripture.
THey devide ye scripture i^ to iiij. senses / ye literal / tropologicall /
allegorical anagogicall. The literal sense is become nothi^ge at all. For the
pope has taken it clean away and has made it his possession. He has partly
locked it up with ye false and counterfayted keys of his tradicions ceremonies
and feigned lies And partly dryveth me^ from it with violence of sword. For no
man dare abide by ye litterall sense of ye text / but under a protestacio^ /
if it shall please ye pope. The tropologicall sense perteyneth to good manners
(say they) and teaches what we ought to do. The allegory is appropriate to
faith / and the anagogicall to hope and things above. Tropologicall and
anagogicall are terms of their own faynynge and all together unnecessary. For
they are but allegories both two of the^ and this word allegory comprehends
them both and is enough. For chopologicall is but an allegory of manners and
anagogicall an allegory of hope. Allegory and what it signifies*
And allegory is as much to say as strange speaking or borrowed speech. As
when we say of a wa^ta^ childe^ / this sheep has magottes in his tail / he
must be anointed with byrchi^ salve which speech I borow of the shepardes Thou
shall understood therefore y^ the scripture has but one sense which is ye
literal sense. The scripture has but one sense.
And yt literal sense is ye rote and ground of all and the an^re yt never
fails where unto if thou cleve thou can never err or goo out of the way.
And if thou leve ye litterall sense* thou can not but go^ out of the way.
Never the later the scripture uses proverbes / similitudes / redels or
allegories as all other speeches do / but that which the proverb / similitude
/ redell or allegory signifies is ever the literal sense which thou must seek
out dilgently. As in the english we borow words and sentences of one thing
and apply them unto a another and geve the^ new significacio^s We say let the sea swell and rise as he will yet has God appointed how f^rre he shall goo:
meaning that the tyrauntes shall not do what they would / but that only which
God has appointed them to do / look yer thou lepe / whose literal sense is /
do nothing suddenly or without avisemente. Cut not the bow that thou stondest
upon whose literal sense is oppress not the comyns and is borrowed of hewers.
When a thing speadeth not well / we Borrowed speech*
borowe speech and say / the Byshope has blessed it / because that nothing
speadeth well that they medyll with all.
If the podech be burned to or the meat over roasted / we say / the bysshope
has put his foot in the pot or the bysshope has played the coke / because
the bysshopes burn who they lust and whosoever displeases them. He is a
pontifical fellow / that is / proud and statly. He is popish / that is /
supersticious and faythlesse. It is a pastime for a prelate It is a pleasure
for a pope. He would be free and yet will not have his heed shaven. He would
that no man should smite him and yet has not the popes mark. And of hi^ y^ is
betrayed and woteth not how / we say / he has been at shrifte* she is master
parsons sisters doghter* he is ye byshopes systers* son / he has a cardinal
to his uncle / she is a spiritual whore / it is the gentle woman of ye
parsonage / he gave me a Ryrieleyson. And of her that answers her husband
vj. words for one we say / she is a sister of the charter house / as who
should say / she thinks that she is not bound to keep silence / their
silence shall be a satisfaccion for her. And of him that will not be saved by
Christ's merits / but by the works of his own imaginacio^ we say it is a
holy work man. Thus borow we and feign new speech in every tongue. All fabels
prophesies and redels are allegories as Ysopus fabels and Marliens prop^^sies
and the interpretacion of them are the literal sense.

So in like manner the scripture boroweth words and sentences of a ^ manner
things and makes proverbes and similitud^s or allegoryes. As Christ says
Luke. iiij. Physician heal thy self. Whose interpretacion is do that at
whom which thou do^st in strange places and that is the literal sense. So
when I say Christ is a la^be / I mean not a lamb that bears woll / but a
meke and a paciente lamb which is beaten for other men's fautes. Christ is a
vine / not that bears grapes: but out of whose rote the branches that beleve
/ suck the sprite of life and mercy and grace and power to be the sons of
God and to do his will. The similitudes of the Gospel are allegories borrowed
of wordly matters to express spiritual things. The Apocalipse or revelacio^s
of John are allegories whose litterall sense is herd to find in many places.

Beyond all this / The right use of allegories.
when we have found out the litterall sense of the scripture by the process of
the text or by a like text of a another place* The^ goo we and as ye scripture
boroweth similitudes of wordly things eve^ so we again borow similitudes or
allegories of ye scripture and apply the^ to our purposes / Allegories are no
sense of scripture.
which allegories are not sense of the scripture: but fre things besides the
scripture and all to gether in the liberte of the spirit. Which allegories I
may not make at all the wild adventures: but must keep me with in the
compass of the faith and ever apply mine allegory to Christ and unto the
faith.
Take an ensample / thou have the story of peter how he smote of Malchuses ear
and how Christ healed it again. There have thou in ye plain text great
lerninge / great fruit and great edifienge which I pass over because of
tediousnes. Then come I / when I preach of the law and the gospel / and borow
this example to express the nature of the law and of the Gospel and to paynte
it unto the before thine eyes. And of Peter and his sword make I the law and
of Christ the Gospel saying / as Peter's sword cutteth of the ear so does
the law. The law damneth / the law kylleth / and mangleth the conscience.

There is no ear so righteous that can abide the hearing of the law. There is
no dead so good but that the law damneth it. But Christ / that is to say the
Gospel / the promyses and testamente that God has made in Christ heals the
ear and conscience which the law has hurt. The Gospel is life / mercy and
forgevenes freely / and al together an helinge plaster. And as Peter does but
hurt and make a wound where was none before: eve^ so does the law. For when
we think that we are holy and righteous and full of good deades if the law be
preached a right / our righteousness and good deades vanesh away / as smoke in
the wind and we are left damnable sinners only And as thou seist how ye Christ
heals not till Peter had wonded / and as an healinge plaster helps not
till ye corrosy has trobled the wound / eve^ so ye Gospel helps not / but
when the law has wonded the conscience and brought the sinner in to ^he
knowledge of his sin. Allegories prove no thing
This allegory proves no thing nether can do. For it is not the scripture /
but an example or a similitud^ borrowed of the scripture to declare a text or a
conclusion of the scripture moare expre^ly and to rote it and grave it in the
heart. For a similitude or an example does prynte a thing much deper in the
wits of a man then does a plain speaking and leaves behind him as it
were a stynge to prick him forward and to awake him with all If thou can not
prove the allegory with an open text then is it false doctrine.
Moare over if I could not prove with an open text that which the allegory
does express / then were the allegory a thing to be gested at and of no
greater value then a tale of Robyn hode. This allegory as twichinge his first
part is proved by Paul in iij. chap. of his Pistle to the Romans where he
says. The law causes wr^th. And in vij. chapter to the Romans When the law or
commaundmente came / sin revyved / and I become deed* And in the ij. pistle
to the Corinth. in threde chapter / the law is called the minister of deeth and
da^nacion etce. And as concerning the second part Paul says to the Romans
in.v. chapter In that we are justified by faith we are at peace with God. And
in the second pistle to the Corinthians in.iij. The Gospyll is called the
ministracion of iustifienge and of the spirit. And Gala. iiij. The sprite
comes by preachinge of the faith etc. The litterall sense proves the allegory.
This does the litterall sense prove the allegory and bear it / as the
foundacio^ bears the hou^. And because that allegories prove nothge therefore
are they to be used soberly and seldon and only where the text offers the an
allegory.

And of this manner (as I above h^ve done) does Paul borow a similitude / ^
figure or an allegory of Genesis to express the nature of the law and of the
Gospel / and by Agar and her son declares the property of the law and of
her bond childern which will be justified by deades / and by Sara and her son
declares ye property of the Gospel and of her fre childerne which are
justified by faith / and how the childern of the law which beleve in their
works persecute the childerne of the Gospel which beleve in the mercy and
truth of God and in the testame^te of his son Jesus our lord. And like
wise do we borow likenesses or allegories of the scripture / as of Pharao and
Herod and of the scribes and pharisees / to express our miserable captivite
and persecucion under Antychrist the Pope. The faith was loost through
allegories.


The greatest cause of which captivite and the decay of the faith and this
blyndnes wherein we now are / sprange first of allehoryes. For Origin and the
of his time drew all the scripture unto allegories. Whose ensample they that came
after followed so long / till at the last they forgot the order / and process
of the text / supposinge that the scripture sarved but to feign allegories
upon. In so much that twenty doctors expound one text.xx. ways / as
childern make descant upon plain song Chopologicall sophisters.
Then came our sophisters with their Anagogicall and chopologicall sense and
with an antetheme of half an ench / out of which some of them draw a threde
of.ix. days long. Ye thou shall find ynow that will preach Christ / and
prove what some ever point of the faith that thou will / as well out of a
fabell of Ovide Poetry is as good divinite as the scripture to our scole men.
or any other poyet / as out of saint John's Gospel or Paul's pistels. Ye they
are come unto soch blyndnes that they not only say the literal sense
profits not / but also that it is hurtful and noisome and kylleth the soul.
The litterall sense kylleth s^le sophi^te^.
Which damnable doctrine they prove by a text of Paul. ij Corinth. iij. Where
he says the letter kylleth but the spirit geveth life. Loo say they the
litterall sense kylleth and the spiritual sense geveth life. We must therefore
/ say they / seek out some choplogicall sense.

Here learn what sophistry is and how blind they are / that thou may abhor
the^ and spue them out of thy stomach for ever. Paul by the letter means
Moses law. which the process of the text folowinge declares more bryghte
then the sone. But it is not their gyse to look on ye order of any text but as
they find it in their doctoures so allege they it and so understood it The
letter kille this expound.
Paul makes a compareson between the law and the Gospel and calls the law
the letter / because it was but letters graven in two tables of cold stone.
For the law does but kill and damn the consciences / as long as there is no
lust in the heart to do that which the law commands. Contrary wise he
calls ye Gospel the administration of the sprite and of righteousness or
iustifienge For when Christ is p^eached and the promyses which God has made in
Christ are beleved / the sprite enters the heart and loses the heart and
geveth lust to do the law and makes the law a lyvely thing in the heart.
To love the law is righteousness.
Now as soon as the heart lusts to do the law / then are we righteous before
God and our sins forgeven. Never thelesse the law of the letter graved in
stone and not in the hertes was so glorious / that Moysesis face shone so
bryghte that the childerne of Israel could not behold his face forbryghtnes.
It was also geve^ in thunder and lighninge and t^reble signs / so that they
for fear came tot Moses and desired him that he would speak to them and let
God speak no moare. Lest we dye (said they) If we hear him any moare: as thou
may se Exodi twenty. Wherapon Paul makes his comparison saying: if the
ministration of deeth through the letters figured in stones was glorious / so
that the childern of Israel could not behold ye face of Moses for the glory
of his countenance: why shall not the administracion of the sprite be
glorious? And again: if the administration of damnacion be glorious: much
moare shall the administration of righteousness excead in glory: That is / if
the law that kylleth sinners and helps them not be glorious: then the Gospel
which pardons sinners and geveth them power to be the sons of God and to
over come sin / is much moare glorious. And the text that goes before is as
clear.

For the holy Apostel Paul says / ye Corinthians are our Pistle / which is
understand and red of all men / in that ye are known how that ye are ye
pistle of Christ ministered by us and written: not with ynke (as Moses law)
but with the sprite of the lyvinge God: not in tables of stone (as the ten
commaundme^tes) but in the fleshy tables of ye heart / as who should say / we
write not a deed law with ynke and in parchemente / ner grave that which damned
you in tables of stone: but preach you yt which brings the sprite of life
unto your breasts / which sprite writes and graveth the law of love in your
hertes and geveth you lust to do the will of God. And forthermoare / says he
our ablenes comes of God which has made us able to mynistre the new
testament / not of the letter (that is to say not of the law) but of the
sprite. For ye letter (that is to say the law) kylleth: but ye sprite geveth
life (that is to say the sprite of God which enters your hertes when ye
beleve the glad tydinges that are preached you in Christ / quickens your
hertes and geveth you life and lust and makes you to do of love and of your
own accord with out compulsio^ / yt which the law compelled you to do and
damned you because ye could not do with love and lust and naturally. This
seist thou that the letter signifies not the literal sense and the sprite the
spiritual sense. And Romans ij. uses Paul this term litera for the law. And
To. vij. where he sette^h it so plain / that if the great wrath of God had not
blinded them they could never have stombled at it.

God is a sprite and all his words are spiritual. His The litterall sense is
spiritual.
litterall sense is spiritual and all his words are spiritual. When thou
read. Mathei. j. she shall bear a son and thou shall call his name Jesus.
For he shall save his people from their sins This litterall sense is
spiritual and everlastinge life unto as many as beleve it. And the litterall
sense of these words Math. v. blessed are the merciful / for they shall have
mercy are spiritual and life. Whereby they that are merciful may of right by
the truth and promise of God calenge mercy. And like is it of these words.
Mathei vj. If you forgeve othermen their sins your hevenly father shall
forgeve you yours. And so is it of all the promises of God. Finally all gods
words are spiritual / if thou have eyes of God to se the right meaning of
the text and where unto the scripture perteyneth and the final end and cause
thereof.

All the scripture is either the promyses and testamente of God in Christ and
stories perteyninge there unto / to strength thy faith either the law and stones
perteyninge thereto to fear the from evell doing. What is to be sought in the
scripture and in the litteral sense.
There is no story nor gest / seem it never so simple or so vile unto the
world / but that thou shalt find therein spirit and life and edifienge in
the litterall sense. For it is Gods scripture written for thy learning and
conforte. There is no cloute or ragge there that has not precious relics
wrapte therein of faith / hope / patience and long soferinge and of the truth
of God / and also of his ryghtwesnes. Set before the the story of The story of
Ruben.
Ruben which defiled his fathers bed. Mark what a cross G^d sofered to fall
on the neck of his elect Jacob. Considre first the shame among the hethen /
when as yet there was no mo^ of the whole world with in the testamente of God

honor whether it were a cross or no. Seist thou not how our weked bylders
rage / because they se their byldynges burn / now they are tried by the fire
of Gods word / and how they stere up the whole world / to quench the word of
God / for fear of loosynge their honor? Then what busynes had he to pacyfie
his childerne? Look what a do he had at the defylinge of his dochter Dina. And
be thou sure that the brethern there were no more furious for the defylinge of
their sister / then the sons here for the defylynge of their mother. Mark
what followed Ruben / to fear other that they shame not their fathers and
mothers. He was cursed and loost the kingdom and also the prestdome / and his
tribe or generation was ever few in number as it appears in ye stories of the
Bible.

The adultery of David.
The adultery of David with Barsabe is an ensample / not to move us to evell:
but if (while we follow the way of ryghteousnes) any chance dryve us a side /
that we despere not. For if we saw not soch infyrmytes in Gods elect / we
which are so weke and fall so often should utterly despeare and think that God
had clean forsaken us. It is therefore a sure and an undoubted conclusion /
whether we be holy or onholy / we are all sinners. But the difference is / that
Gods sinners consent not to their sin. The difference between gods sinners
and the devyls.
They consent unto the law yt it is both holy and ryghteous and morn to have
their sin taken away. But the devels sinners co^sente unto their sin and
would have the law and hell taken away and are enemies unto the righteousness
of God.

Like wise in the whomely ges^ of Noe / Noe^
when he was drunk / and lay in his tente with his pryvey members opon / have
thou great edyfyenge in the litterall sense. Thou seyst what became of the
cursed childern of weked ham which saw his fathers privey members and gested
thereof unto his brethern. Thou seyst also what blessing fell on S^m and
Iaphet which went backwarde and covered their fathers members and saw them not.
And thredly thou seyst what infirmyte accompanie^h Gods elect be they never so
^oly / which yet is not imputed unto them. For the faith and trust they have in
God swaloweth up all there sins. The Pope is likened to ham


Not with standing this text offers us an apt and an honsome allegory or
similitude to destribe our weked ha^ a^tichriste the pope which many hundred
years has done all the shame that heart can think unto the privey membre of
God which is the word of promise or the word of faith as Paul calls it
Roma. x. and the Gospel and testamente of Christ wherewith we are begote^ /
as thou seist.j. Petri. j. and James. j. And as ye cursed childern of ham grew
in to geauntes so mighty and great that the childern of Israel seemed but
greshoppers in respect of the^: so the cursed sons of our Ham the Pope his
cardinals / bisshopes / abbotes / monks and freres are become mighty geauntes
above all power and auctorite / so that the childern of faith in respect of
them / are much less then greshoppers. The will to heven by a way of there
own making.
They hepe mountain apo^ mountain and will to heven by their own strength
and by a way of their own making and not by the way Christ Never the later
those geauntes for the w^kednes and abominations which they had wrought / did
God utterly destroy / part of them by the childern of Loath and part by the
chyldern of Esau and seven nations of them by the childern of Israel. So no
doubt shall he destroy these for like abhomi^acions and that shortly. For
their kingdom is but ye kingdom of lies and falsheed which must needs perish
at the coming of the truth of Gods word / as the night vanesheth away at
the presence of day. The childern of Israel slew not those geauntes / but the^
power of God / Gods truth and promyses as thou may se in Deutero. * So it is
not we that shall destroy those geauntes / as thou may se by Paul. ij.
Thessaloni. ij. speaking of our ham Antichrist. Whom the lord shall destroy
(says he) with the sprite of his mouth (that is / by the words of truth)
and by the bryghtnes of his coming (yt is / by the preachinge of his Gospel.

ANd as I have said of allegories / eve^ so it is of worldly similitudes which
we make either when we preach either when we expound the scripture. The use of
similitudes.
The similitudes prove no thing / but are made to express moare plainly that
which is contained in ye scripture and to lead the i^ ye spiritual
vndersto^di^ge of ye text. As ye similitude of matrimony is taken to express
ye marriage that is between christ and our souls and what exceadinge mercy we
/ have there / where of all ye scriptures make me^cio^. And ye similitude of ye
me^bres / how every one of them cares for other is take to make ye feel what
it is to love thy neyboure as thy self. A similitude with out scripture is a
sure token of a false prophet.
That preacher therefore yt bri^geth a naked similitude to prove yt which is
contained in no text of scripture ner follows of a text / count a disceaver
/ a leader out of ye way and a false prophet / and beware of his philosophy
and persuasions of man's wisdom as Paul every where warns the. Paul. j.
Corinth. ij. says: Paul preached not worldly wisdom.
my words and my preachinge were not with entysinge words and persuasions of
man's wisdom but in showinge of the sprite and power / that is / he preached
not dreams confirminge them with similitudes: but Gods word confirminge it
with miracles and with workinge of the sprite the which made them feel every
thing in their her^es. That your faith / says he / should not stand in ye
wisdom of man: but in the power of God Similitudes and reas^ns of man's wisdom
make no faith but waveringe opinions only.
For ye reasons and similitudes of man's wisdom make no faith / but waveringe
and uncertain opinions only: one draws me this way with his argume^te a
another that / and of what principle thou provest black a another proves white
/ and so am I ever uncertain / as if thou tell me of a thing done in a far
land and a another tell me the contrary / I wot not what to beleve. But faith
is wrought by ye power of God / that is / (...) Gods word is preached / the
spirit enters thine heart and makes thy soul feel it and makes ye so sure
of it / Gods word makes sure faith for god can not lie.
yt nether adversite nor persecucion / ner deeth / nether hell / ner the powers
of hell / nether yet all the pains of hell could ones prevayle agenst the or
move the from the sure rock of Gods word / that thou should not beleve that
which God has sworn.

And Peter. ij. Petri. j. says we followed not deceavable Peter preached not
fables and false similitudes but the plain scripture.
fables / when we opened unto you the power and coming of our lord Jesus
Christ: but with our eyes we saw his majesty. And again / we have (says he)
a moare sure word of prophecy / where unto if ye take heed / as unto a light
shininge in a dark place / ye do well. The word of prophesy was the old
testamente which bears record unto Christ in every place / without which
record ye Apostles made nether similitudes nor arguments of worldly wit.
Here of seist thou / that all the allegories / similitudes / pesuasions and
arguments which they bring without scripture / to prove praye^ge to saints /
purgatory / ear confession and that God will he are thy prayar moare in one
place then in a another / and that it is moare meritorious to eat fysh then
flesh / and that to disgise thy self and put on this or that manner cote is
moare acceptable then to goo as God has made the / and that wedowhode is
better then matrimony and virginite then wedowhode / and to prove the
assumpcion of our lady and that she was borne without original sin / ye and
with a kiss say some / are but false doctrine. Scole doctrine.


Take an ensample how they prove yt wedowhode and virginite exceade matrimony
they bri^ge this worldli similitude He yt takes most pain for a man deserves
most and to him a man is most bound / so like wise must it be with God and so
forth: now the wedow and virgyn take moare pain in resistinge their lusts
then the married wife / therefore is their state holyer. First I say / that in
their own sophistry a similitude is the worst and feblest argume^te that can
be and proves lest and sonest disceaveth. Similitudes are no good arguments
among the sophisters own selves.
Though that one sone do moare service for his father the^ a another / yet is
the father fre and may with right reward them all a like. For though I had a
thousand brethern and did moare the^ they all / yet do I not my duty. The
fathers and mothers also care most for the leest and wekest and them that can
do leest: ye for the worst care they most and would spend / not their goods
only: but also their blood to bring them to the right way. And eve^ so is
it of ye kingdom of Christ as thou may well se in the similitude of the
riotous son Luke. xv. Moare over Paul says.j. Cor. vij. It is beter to marie
then to burn. For the person yt burns can not quietly serve God in as much
as his mind is drawn away and the thoughts of his heart occupied with
wonderful and monstrous imaginacions. He can nether se / ner hear / ner read
but that his wits are rapte and he clean from him self. And again / says
he / circuncision is nothing vncircuncision is no thing: but the keeping of
the commaundmentes is all to gether. Look where in thou can best keep the
commaundmentes thither get thy self and therein abide / wheder thou be wedow
wife or maid / and then have thou all with God We must cure our i^firmites
with the reamedies that god has ordened and not tempte God.
If we have infirmites that draw us from the laws of God / let us cure them
with the remedies that God has made. If thou burn mary For God has promised
the no chastity / as long as thou may use the remedy that he has ordened:
no moare then he has promised to flake thine hongre without meat

Now to ask of God moare then he has promised comes of a false faith and is
plain ydolatry: and to desire What temptinge of God is*
a miracle where there is natural remedy / is temptinge of God. And of pain
taking this wise understand. He that takes pain to keep ye commaundmentes
of god is sure there by that he loves god and that he has gods sprite in him.
And the moare pain a man takes (I mean patiently and without grouginge) the
moare he loves God and the perfecter he is and near unto that health which
the souls of all christen men longefore and the moare purged from the
infirmyte and sin that remains in the flesh: but to look for any other
reward or promocion in heven or in the life to come tha^ that which God has
promised for Christ's sake and which Christ has deserved for us with his
pain taking / is abominable in the sight of God. For Christ only has
purchesed the reward / and our pain taking to keep the commaundmentes does
but purge the sin that remains in the flesh / and cerrifie us that we are
chosen and sealed with Gods spirit unto the tewarde that Christ has
purchased for us.

I was once at the creatinge of doctors of divinite / where the oponente
brought the same reason to prove that ye wedow had moare merit then the vigin
/ because she had greater pain for as much as she had once proved the
pleasures of matrimony. Ego ne go domine doctor said the respondente. For
though the virgen have not proved / yet she imagines that the playsure is
gretter then it is in dead and therefore is moare moved and has greater
temptacion and greater pain. Are not these disputers they that Paul speaks
of in the sixte chapter of ye first pistle to Timotheum. That they are not /
content with the wholesome words of our lord Jesus Christ / and doctrine of
godliness. And therefore know no thing: but wast their brains about
questions and strifte of words / whereof spring envy / strife and raylinge of
men with corrupt minds destitute of the troth.

As pertaining to our ladies body / wh^re it is or where the body of Elyas /
of John the Evangeliste and of many other be / perteyneth not to us to know.
One thing are we sure of / that they are where God has leyde the^.
If they be in heve^ / we have never the moare in Christ: If they be not there
/ we have never the less. Our duty is to prepare our selves unto the
commaundmentes and to be thankful for that which is opened unto us / and not
to sherch the vnsherchable secrets of God. Of Gods secrets can we know no
moare then be opens unto us. If God shut / who shall open? How the^ ca^
natural reason come by ye knowledge of that which God has hyd unto himself?

Yet let us se one of their reasons where with they prove it. The chief reason
is this / every man does moare for his mother / say they / then for other /
in like manner must Christ do for his mother / therefore has she this
pre-eminence / that her body is in heven. And yet Christ in the twelf chapter
of Mathe. knows her not for his mother: but as ferforth as she kept his
fathers commaundmentes. And Paul in the second Pistle to the Corintheans in v.
chap. knows not Christ himself fleshly or after a worldly purpose. Last of
all god is fre and no forther bound the^ he bi^deth himself: if he have made
her any promise he is bound / if not / then is he not. Finally if thou set
this above rehearsed chapter of Math. before the where Christ would not know
his mother / and the second of John where he rebuked her / and the second of
Luke where she loost him and how negligente she was to leve him behind her at
Jerusalem vnwars and to goo a days Journey yer she sought for him thou might
solve many of their reasons which they make of this matter / and that she was
without original sin: read also Erasmusis annotations in the said places.
And as for me I commit all soch matters unto those idle belies which have
naught else to do / then to move soch questions and geve the^ fre liberty to
hold what they list / as long as it hurts not the faith / whether it be so
or no: exhorti^ge yet with Paul all that will please God and obtain that
salvation that is in Christ / that they geve no head unto unnecessary and
braulynge disputacions / and yt they labor for the knowledge of those things
without which they cannot be saved And remember yt the son was geven us to
gyde us in our way and works bodyly. Now if thou leave the natural use of
the son and will look directly on him to se how brighte he is and sochlike
curiosite then will the son blind the. So was the scripture geve^ us to gyde
us in our way and works goostly. The way is Christ and the promises in him
are our salvacion if we long for them. Now if we shall leave that right use
and turn our selves unto vain questions and to sherch the vnsherchable
secrets of God: then no doubt shall the scripture blind us as it has done
our scole me^ and our sotle disputers.

ANd as they are false prophets which prove with allegories / similitudes and
wordly reasons that which is no where made mention of in the scripture.
Even so count them for false prophets which expound the scriptures drawinge
them unto a worldly purpose clean contrary unto the In expoundinge of the
scripture we must have a respect unto the lyvinge and practisinge of christ
and of his apostels and prophetes^
example / lyvinge / and practisinge of Christ and of his Apostles and of all
the holy prophets. For says Peter. ij. Petri. j. no prophesy in the scripture
has any private interpretation. For the scripture came not by the will of man:
but the holy men of God spoke / as they were moved by the holy ghost. No place
of the scripture may have a private exposition / that is it may not be
expound aftyr the will of man or aftyr the will of ye flesh or drawn unto a
wordldly purpose contrary unto the open textes and the general articles of the
faith and the whole course of the scripture and contrary to the lyvinge and
practisynge of Christ and the Apostles and holy prophets. For as they came
not by the will of man so may they not be drawn or expound after the will of
man: but as they came by the holy ghost / so must they be expound and
understand by the holy ghost. The scripture is that where with God draws us
unto him and not where with we should be lead from him. The scriptures spring
out of God and flow unto Christ / and were geven to lead The scripture was
geven to lead us unto Christ.
us to Christ. Thou must therefore goo alonge by the scripture as by a line /
until thou come at Christ / which is the ways end and resting place. If any
man therefore use the scripture to draw the from Christ and to nosell the in
any thing save in Christ / the same is a false prophet. And that thou may
perceave what Peter means / it follows in the text.
There where false prophets among the people (whose prophesies were belly
wisdom) as there shall be false teachers among you: which shall prively bring
in damnable Sects or orders.
sects (as thou seist how we are divided in to monstrous sects or orders of
religion) even denienge the lord that has bought them. (For every one of them
takes on him to sell the for money that which God in Christ promyseth the
freely) and many shall follow their damnable ways / by who^ the way of troth
shall be evell spoken of (as thou seist how the way of troth is become heresy
sedicious or cause of insurreccion and breaking of the kings peace and
treason unto his hynes). And through covetousnes with feigned words shall they
make merchaundyse of you. Covetousnes Covetousnes and desire of honor is the
end of all false doctrine and that which false prophets seek.
is the conclusion: for covetousnes and ambicion that is to say / lucre and
desire of honor is the fynall end of all false prophets and of all false
teachers. Look upon the Popes false doctrine / what is the end thereof and what
seek they there by? Wherefore serves Purgatory.
purgatory? but to purge thy purse and to polle the and rob both the and thy
hyeres of house and lands and of all thou have / that they may be in honor.

confession / but to sit in thy conscience and to make the fear and tremble
at what so ever they dream and that thou worshepe them as Gods: and so forth
in all their tradicions / ceremonies / and coniuracions they serve not the

drawing it contrary unto the example of Christ and the Apostles and holy
Prophets unto their damnable covetousnes and fylthy ambicion take an example.
An example of false expoundinge the scriptures.


Math. xvj. When Peter says to Christ thou art the son of the lyvinge God /
and Christ answered / thou art Peter and upon this rock I will bylde my
congregation. By the rock interpret they Peter. And then comes the pope and
will be Peter's successor / whether Peter will or will not / ye whether God will
or will not and though all the scripture say nay to any soch succession / and
says / loo I am the rock / the foundacio^ and heed of Christ's church
Christ the faith and Gods-word is the rock and not the pope
Now says all the scripture that the rock is Christ / the faith and Gods
word. As christ says Math. vij. he yt hears my words and does thereafter
is like a man yt byldeth on a rock. For the house yt is bylde on Gods words
will sto^de / though heve^ should fall. And John. xv. Christ is ye wine and we
ye branches / so is Christ ye rock / ye stock and fundacio^ where on we be
bylde. And Paul. j. Cor. iij. calls Christ our fundacion and all other /
whether it be Peter or Paul / he calls our serva^tes to preach Christ and
to bylde us on hi^. If therefore ye pope be peter's successoure / his duty is to
preach Christ only and other auctorite has he none. The auctorice of peter's
successoure is but to preach.
And.ij.xj. Paul marieth us unto Christ and dryveth us from all trust and
confidence in man And Ephesio. ij. says Paul. Ye are bylde on the fundacion
of the Apostles and prophets / that is on the word which they preached /
Christ being / says he / the head corner stone / in whom every byldinge
coupled to gether grows up in to an holy temple in the lord / in whom also
ye are bylde together and made an habitacio^ for God in the spirit. And Peter
in the second of his first pistle bildeth us on Christ / contrary unto the
Pope which byldeth us on him self. Hell gates shall not prevayle agenst it /
that is to say / agenste the congregation that is bylde apo^ Christ's faith
and upon Gods word. Now were the Pope the rock / hell gates could not
prevayle agenste him. For the housse could not stand if the rock and
foundation where on it is bylde did perish: but the contrary se we in our
Popes. For hell gates have prevayled agenste them many hundred years / and have
swalowed them up: if Gods word be true and the stories that are written of
them: ye or if it be true that we se with our yes. I will geve the ye keys
of heven says Christ / and not I geve. And John. xx. after the resurrection
paid it and gave the keys to the^ all indifferently. What soever thou byndest
on earth / it shall be bound in heven / and what soever thou lousest on earth it
shall be loused in heven. Of this text makes the Pope what he will / and
expounds it contrary to all the scripture / contrary to Christ's practysinge
/ and the Apostles / and all the prophets. * Now the scripture geveth record
to him self and ever expounds it self by an other open text. If the Pope
then can not bring for his exposicion the practysinge of Christ or of the
Apostles and prophets or an open text / then is his exposicion false
doctrine. That exposicion is false which is against the epen scripture or agenst
the practisinge of christ and of his apostles..
Christ expounds him self. Mathei. xviij. saying: If thy brother sin
agenste the rebuke him betwixt him and the alone. If he here the thou have
wo^ne thy brother: but if he here ye not the^ take with ye one or two and so
forth as it stands in ye text he concludes saye^ge to the^ all what so ever
ye bind in earth it shall be bound in heven and what soever ye louse on earth it
shall be loused in heven. Where byndinge is but to rebuke them that sin and
lousynge to forgeve them that repent. And John. xx. Whose sins ye forgeve
they are forgeven and whose sins ye hold they are holden. And Paul. j.
Corinthiorum. v. binds / and.ij. Corinthioru^. ij. louseth after the same
manner.

Also this byndinge and lousinge is one power / and as he byndeth so louseth
he: Byndynge and lowsinge is one power.
ye and byndeth first yer he can louse. For who can louse that is not bound.
Now what so ever Peter byndeth or his successoure (as he will be called and is
not / but in dead the very successoure of Satan) is not so to be understand /
that Peter or the Pope has power to command a man to be in deedly sin or
to be damned or to goo in to hell saying: be thou in deedly sin / be thou
damned / goo thou to hell / goo thou to purgatory. For that exposicion is
contrary to the everlastinge testame^te that God has made unto us in Christ.
He sent his son Christ to louse us from sin and damnacion and hell / and
that to testify unto the world sent he his disciples Acts. j. Paul also
has no power to destroy / but to edefie.ij. Corithiorum. x. and.xiij. How can
Christ geve his disciples power against him self and agenst his everlastinge
testamente? Can he send them to preach salvacion and geve them power to damn
whom they lust? What mercy and profit have we in Christ's deeth and in his
Gospel / if the Pope which passes all men in wekednesse has power to send
whom he will to hell / and to damn whom he lusts? we had the^ no cause / to
call him What Jesus signifies.
Jesus / that is to say saver: but might of right call him destroy ar.
Wherefore then this byndinge is to be understood as Christ interprets it in
the places above rehearsed and as the Apostles practysed it What byndi^ge
meaneth^
and is nothing but to rebuke men of their sins by preachinge the law. A man
must first sin agenste Gods law yer the Pope can bind him: ye and a man
must first sin agenste Gods law yer he need to fear the Popes curse. What
cursynge means.
For cursinge and byndinge are both one and * no thing save to rebuke a man of
his sins by Gods law. It follows also then that the lousynge is of like
manner / and is no thing (...) forgevinge of sin to them that repent through
preachinge of ye promyses which God has made in Christ in whom only we have
all forgevenes of sins / What low sing means.
as Christ interprets it and as the Apostles and prophets practysed it. So
is it a false power that the pope takes on him to louse Gods laws / as to
geve a man license to put away his wife to whom God has bound him / and to
bind them to chastity which God commands to mary / that is to wete them
that burn and can not lyve chaste. It is also a false power to bind that
which Gods word makes fre / making sin in the creatures which God has
made for ma^s use.


The Pope which so fast lowses and purges in purgatory / can not with all the
low synges and purgacions that he has either lowse or purge our appetites and
lust and rebellion that is in us agenst the law of God And yet the purginge of
them is the right purgatory. If he can not purge them that are a lyve / where
with purges he them / that are deed? * The Apostles knew no other ways to
purge / but through preachinge Gods word which word only is that that purges
the heart / as thou may se Ihon xv. Ye are pure / says Christ / through the
word. Now the Pope preaches not to the^ whom the feign to lie in purgatory /
no moare the^ he does to us that are alyve. How then purges he them? The Pope
is Robyn goodfelow.
The Pope is kynne to Robyn goodfellow which swepeth the house / washes the
disshes and purges all by night. But when day comes there is no thing
found clean.

Some man will say the Pope byndeth them not / they bind them selves. I
answare he that byndeth him self to the pope and had lever have his life and
soul ruled by the Popes will the^ by the will of God and by the Popes word
then by the word of god / is a fool. And he that had lever be bond then fre
is not wise. And he that will not abide in the fredome wherein Christ has
set us / is also mad. And he that makes deedly sin where none is and
seeks causes of hatered between him and God is not in his right wits.
Forther moare no man can bind him self further then he has power over him
self. He that is under the power of a another man can not bind him self
without license / as son / doghter / wife / servante and subject. Nether
can thou geve God that which is not in thy power. Chastity can thou not
geve God further then God lends it the / if thou can not live chaste thou
art bound to mary or to be damned. Last of all for what purpose thou byndest
thy self must be seen. If thou do it to obtain thereby that which Christ has
purchased for the freely / so art thou an infidel and have no part with
Christ and so forth. If thou will se moare of this matter look in
Deuteronomion and there shall thou find it moare largely entreaded

Take an other ensample of there false expoundynge the scripture. Christ says
Mathei. xxiij. A another example.
The scribes and the phareses sit on Moses seat / what soever they bid you
observe / that observe and do: but after their works do not. Loo say our
sophisters or ypocrites / lyve we never so abhominably / yet is our auctorite
never the less. Do as we teach therefore (say they) and not as we do. And yet
Christ says they sit on Moses seat / yt is as long as they teach Moses do
as they teach. For the law of Moses is the law of God. But for their own
tradicions and false doctrine Christ rebuked them and disobeyed them and taught
other to be ware of their leven. So if our phareses sit on Christ's seat
and preach him / we ought to hear them: but when they sit on their own
seat / then ought we to beware as well of their pestilente doctrine as of
their abominable livinge.

Like wise where they find mencio^ made of a sword / they turn it unto the
popes power. The disciples said unto Christ Luke xxij. Loo here be two
swerdes. And Christ answered two is enough. Loo / say they the Pope has two
swerdes / the spiritual sword and the temperall sword. And therefore is it
lawful for him to fight and make war.

Christ a little before he went to his passion / axed his disciples saying:
when I sent you out without all provision lacked ye any thing. And they said
nay. And he answered / but now let him that has a walet take it with him and
he that has a scrippe like wise / and let hi^ that has never a sword sell
his cote and by one: As who should say / it shall goo otherwise now then then.
Then ye went forth in faith of my word and my fathers promyses and it fed
you and made provision for you and was your sword and shilde and defender:
but now it shall goo as thou read Zacharias. xiij. I will smite the sheparde
and the sheep of the flock shall be scatered. Now shall my father leave me in
the hands of ye weked and ye also shall be forsaken and destitute of faith /
and shall trust in your selves and in your own provision and in your own
defense. Christ gave no commandment / but prophesied what should happen. And
they because they understood him not / answered here are two swerdes. And
Christ to make an end of soch babylynge answered two is enough. For if he had
commanded every man to by a sword / how had two been enough? Also if two were
enough / and pertayned to the Pope only / why are they all commanded to
byevery man a sword? By the sword therefore Christ prophesied that they
should be lafte unto their own defense. And two swerdes were enough: ye never
a one had been enough. For if every one of them had had ten swerdes they would
have fled yer mydnyghte.

In the same chapter of Luke not.xij. lines from the forsaid text. The
disciples eve^ at the last soper axed who should be the greatest And Christ
rebuked the^ and said it was an hethenish thing and there should be no soch
thing among them / but that the greatest should be as the smallest / and that
to be great was to do service as Christ did. But this text because it is
brighter then the son / that they can make no sophistry of it / therefore will
they not hear it ner let other know it

FOr as much now as thou partly seist the falshed of our prelates / how all
their study is to disceave us and to keep us in darkness / to sit as Gods in
our consciences and handle us at their pleasure and to lead us whether the
lust: therefore / I red the / get the to Gods word and thereby try all
doctrine and agenst that receave nothing. Nether any exposicion contrary unto
the open textes / nether contrary to the general articles of the faith / nether
contrary to the livinge and practisinge off Christ and off his Apostles.
Fathers fathers.
And when they cry fathers fathers / remember that it were the fathers that
both blinded and robbed the whole world and brought us in to this captivite
where in these enforse to keep us still. Forther moare as they off the old
time are fathers to us / so shall these foul monsters be fathers to the^ that
come after us / and the ypocrites that follow us will cry of these and of
their doings fathers fathers / as these cry fathers / fathers / of them that
are past. And as we feale our fathers / so did they that are past feale their
fathers: nether were there in the world any other fathers then soch as we both
se and feale this many hundred years / as there decrees bear record and the
stories and chronicles well testifye. If Gods word appeared any where they
agreed all agenst it. When they had brought that a sleep / then strove they one
with a another about their own traditions and one pope condemned a nothers
decrees and were some time two / ye three popes attonce. And one bisshope went
to law with a another and one cursed a another for their own fantasies and soch
things as they had falsely gotten. And the greatest saints are they that most
defended the liberties of the church (as they call it) which they falsely got
with blyndinge kings / nether had the world any rest this many hundred years
for reforminge of freres and monks and ceasinge of scismes that were among
our clergy. And as for the holy doctors as Augustine / Hierom / Cipriane /
Chresostomus and Bid / will they not hear. If they wrote any thing
negligently (as they were men) that draw they clean contrary to their meaning
and thereof trihumphe they. Those doctors knew of none auctorite that one
Bishope should have above a another / nether thought or once dreamed that ever
any soch should be / or of any soch whisperi^ge or of pardons / or scouringe of
purgatory / as they have feigned.

Miracles miracles.
And when they cry miracles miracles remember that God has made an
everlastinge testamente with us in Christ's blood / agenst which we may
receave no miracles no nether the preachinge of Paul him self if he came
again / by his own teachinge to the Galathiens / nether yet the preachinge of
the angels of heven. The woman of le^ster was a solemn miracle
Wherefore either they are no miracles but they have feigned them (as is the
miracle that saint Peter hallowed westmester) or else / if there be miracles
that confirm doctrine contrary to Gods word / then are they done of the
devell (as the maid of ypswich and of kent) to prove us whether we will cleve
fast to Gods word and to desceave them that have no love to the truth of Gods
word ner lust to walk in his laws. The armoure of the spiritualte.


And for as much as they to disceave with all arm them selves agenst the with
arguments and persuasions of fleshly wisdom / with worldly similitudes with
shadows / with false allegories / with false exposicions of the scripture
contrary unto the livinge and practisinge of Christ and the Apostles / with
lies and false miracles / with false names / dome ceremonies / with disgisinge
of ypocresy / with the auctorites of the fathers and last of all with the
violence of the temperall sword: The armure af a christian man is gods word and
faith.
therefore do thou contrary wise arm thy self / to defend the with all / as
Paul teaches in the last chapter to the Ephesians Gyrde on the the sword of
the spirit which is Gods word and take to the the shilde of faith / which is
not to beleve a tale of Robyn hode or Gestus Romanorum or of the Chronicles /
but to beleve Gods word that lasts ever.

And when the Pope with his falsheed cale^geth te^perall auctorite above king
and Emperor: set before the fyve and twenty Chapter off Saint Matthew. Where
Christ co^maundteth Peter to put up his sword. And set before the Paul. ij.
Corin. x. Where he says the wepons of our war are not carnal things but
mighty in god to bring all understanding in captivite under the obedience of
Christ / that is / the wepons are Gods word and doctrine and not swerdes of
yeron and stele / and set before the ye doctrine of Christ and of his Apostles
and their practice

And when the Pope calengeth auctorite over his fellow Bisshopes and over all
the congregation of Christ by succession of Peter set before the the first of
the Acts where Peter for all his auctorite put no man in the rowme of Judas /
but all the Apostles chose two indifferently and cast lottes desyringe God to
temper them that the lotte might fall on the most ablest. And Acts viij. the
apostles sent Peter / and in the.xj. call him to reckoning and to geve
acomptes of that he has done.


And when the Popes law commands saying: though that the Pope lyve never so
wekedly and draw with him through his evell ensample innumerable thousands unto
hell / yet se that no man presume to rebuke him / for he is head over all and no
man over him: set before the Galath. ij. Where Paul rebukes Peter openly. And
se how both to the Corinthians and also to the Galathiens he will have no
superior but Gods word and he that could teach better by Gods word. And
because when he rehearsed his preachinge and his doings unto the hye Apostles /
they could improve no thing / therefore will he be equal with the best.

And when the freres say / they do moare then their duty when they preach
and moare then they are Freres be not bound to preach^
bound to:
to say our service are we bound (say they) and that is our duty and to
preach is moare then we are bound to. Set thou before the how that Christ's
blood shedinge has bound us to love one a another with all our might and to
do the vttemost of our power one to a another. And Paul says.j. Corinth. ix.
Woe be unto me if I preach not: ye woe is unto him that has where with to help
his neyboure and to make him better and do it not. If they think it moare
then their duty to preach Christ unto you then they think it moare then
their duty to pray that ye should come to the knowledge of Christ. And
therefore it is no mervell though they take so great labor: ye and so great
wages also to keep you still in darkness.

And when they cry furiously hold the heretics unto the wall and if they will
not revoke burn them without any moare a do reason not with them / it is an
article condemned / by the fathers. Set thou before the the saying of Peter.
j. Petri. iij. To all that axe you be ready to geve an answer of the hope that
is in you and that with meakenes. The fathers of the Jews and the bisshopes /
which had as great auctorite over the^ as ours have over us / condemned Christ
and his doctrine. If it be enough to say the fathers have condemned it then
are the Jews to be hold excused: ye they are yet in the right way and we in
the false. But and if the Jews be bound to look in the scripture and to se
whether their fathers have done right or wrong / the^ are we like wise bound
to look in the scripture whether our fathers have done right or wrong / and
ought to beleve no thing with out a reason of the scripture and auctorite of
Gods word.

And of this manner defend thy self agenst all manner wekednes of our sprites
/ armed all way with Gods word and with a strong and a steadfast faith there
unto. Without Gods word do nothing. And to his word add nothing nether
pull any thing there from / as Moses every where teaches the. How god ought
to be served.
Serve God in the sprite / and thy neyboure with all outward service.
Serve God as he has appointed the and not with thy good entente and good
zele. Remember Saul was cast away of God for ever for his good entente. God
requires obedyence unto his word and abhors all good ententes and good
zeles which are without Gods word. For they are nothing else then plain
ydolatry and worshepinge of false Gods. In Christ is rest of conscience only.


And remember that Christ is the end of all thing. He only is our restinge
place and he is our peace. Ephesiorum second chapter. For as there is no
salvacion in any other name / so is there no peace in any other name. Thou
shall never have rest in thy soul nether shall the worm of conscience ever
cease to gnaw thine heart till thou come at Christ: till thou hear the glad
tidings / how that God for his sake has forgeven the all freely. If thou trust
in thy works there is no rest. Thou shall think / I have not done enough.
Have I done it with so great love as I should do? Was I so glad in doing as
I would be to receave help at my neade? I have left this or that undone and
soch like. If thou trust in confession / then shall thou think. Have I told
all? Have I told all the circumstances? Did I repent enough? Had I as great
sorrow in my repentance for my sins as I had pleasure in doing them? Like
wise in our holy pardons and pylgremage / gettest thou no rest. For thou seist
that the very Gods them selves which sell their pardone so good chepe or some
whiles geve the^ freely for glory sake / trust not therein them selves. The byld
colleges and make perpetuites to be prayed for for ever and lade the lyppes of
their beidmen or chaplaynes with so many masses and diriges and so long
service / that I have known of some that have bid the devell take their
founders souls for very impaciencye and werynes of so paynefull labor.

Do good deades and trust in Christ.
As perteyninge to good deades therefore / do the best thou can and desire God
to geve strength to do better daily / but in Christ put thy trust and in the
pardon and promyses that God has made the for his sake / and on that rock
bylde thine house and there dwell. For there only shall thou be sure from all
storms and tempests and from all wyly assaltes of our weked spirits which
stody with all falsheed to undermine us. And the God of all mercy geve the
grace so to do / unto whom be glory for ever. Amen.

A compendious rehersall of that which goes before.
I Have described unto you the obedience of childerne servantes / wives and
subjects. These iiij. orders are of Gods making and the rules thereof are Gods
word. He that keeps them shall be blessed: ye is blessed all ready and he that
breaks them shall be cursed. If any person of impaciency or of a stoburne and
rebellious mind withdraw him self from any of these / and get him to any
other order: let him not think thereby to avoid the vengeance of god in
obeyenge rules and tradicions of man's imaginacion. If thou polledst thine heed
in the worshepe of thy father and breakest his commaundmentes / should thou
so es^ape? Or if thou payntedst thy masters image on a wall and stekedst up a
candle before it / should thou there with make satisfaction / for the
breakinge of his commaundmentes. Or if thou wareste a blew rote in the worshepe
of the king and brakest his laws should thou so go quyte? Let a man's wife
make her self a sister of the charterhouse and answer her husband when he
byddeth her hold her peace / my brethern keep silence for me / and se whether
she shall so escape. And be thou sure God is moare gelouse over his
commaundmentes the^ man is over his or the^ any man is over his wife.

Because we be blind / God has appointed in the scripture how we should serve
him and please him. As perteyninge unto his own person he is abundantly
pleased when we beleve his promyses and holy testamente which he has made unto
us in Christ / and for the mercy which he there showed ^s / love his
commaundmentes. All bodyly service must be done to man in gods stead. We must
geve obedience / honor / toll / tribute / custom / and rent unto whom they
belong. Then if thou have ought moare to bestow / geve unto the pore which
are left here in Christ's stead that we show mercy on them. If we keep the
commaundmentes of love then are we sure that we fulfull the law in the syghte
of God and that our blessinge shall be everlastinge life. Now when we obey
patiently and without grudginge evell princes that oppress us and persecute us
and be kind and merciful to them that are mercylesse to us and do the worst
they can to us and so take all fortune patiently and kiss what so ever cross
God lays on our backs: the^ are we sure that we keep the commaundmente of
love.

I declared that God has taken all vengeance in to his own hands / and will
avenge all onryght himself: either by the powers or officers which are
appointed there to or else / if they be negligente / he will send his curses
upon the transgressors and destroy them with his secret judgments. I showed
also that whosoever avengeth him self is damned in the dead doing and
falls in to the hands of the temperall sword / because he takes the office
of God upon him and robs God of his most hie honor in that he will not
patiently abide his judgment. I showed you of the auctorite of princes / how
they are in Gods stead and how they may not be resisted do they never so evell
/ they must be resarved unto the wrath of God. Never the later if they
command to do evell we must then disobey and say we are other wise
commaundet of God: but not to rise agenste them. They will kill us then say
thou. Therefore / I say is a christen called / to sofre even the bitter deeth
for his hopes sake and because he will do no evyll. I showed also that the
kings and rulers be they never so evell are yet a great gift of the goodness
of god / and defend us from a thousand things that we se not.

I proved also that all men without excepcion are under the temperall sword /
what so ever names they geve them selves. Because the pressed is chosen out of
the lay men / to teach this obedience / is that a lawful cause for him to
disobeye? Because he preaches that ye lay man should not stele / is it
therefore lawful for hi^ to stele unpunished? Because thou teach me that I
may not kill / or if I do the king must kill me again / is it therefore
lawful for the to kill and goo free? Other whether is it rather mete that thou
which art my gyde to teach me the right way should walk therein before me?
The prestes of the old law with their hye Bisshope Aaron and all his
successors / though they were anointed by Gods commaundmente and appointed to
serve God in his temple and exempte from all offices and ministeringe of wordly
matters / were yet never the less under the temporal sword / if they brake
the laws. Christ says to Peter / all that take the sword / shall perish by
the sword. Here is none exception. Paul says all souls must obey. Here is
none excepcion. Paul him self is here not exe^pte. God says Gene. ix. Who so
ever shedeth ma^s blood / by man shall his blood be shede again. Here is none
excepcion.

Moare over Christ became pore to make other men rich / and bond to make
other fre. He left also with his disciples the law of love. Now love seeks not
her own profitte: but her neybours: love seeks not her own fredome / but
becomes suertye and bond to make her neyboure fre. The pope has a law that
none of his sprites may be suerty.
Damned therefore are the spiritualte by all the laws of God / which through
falshed and disgised ypocrisy have sought so great profit / so great riches /
so great auctorite and so great liberties / and have so bedgerd the lay and
so brought them in subieccion and bondage and so despice them / that they have
set up frauncheses in all towns and villages for whosoever robs /
morthereth or sleyeth them / and even for traitors unto the kings person also.

I proved also that no king has power to grant them soch liberty: but are
as well damned for their gevinge / as they for their false purchasinge. For as
God geveth the father power over his childern: even so geveth he him a
commaundmente to execute it / and not to sofre them to do wekedly unpunished
but unto his damnacion / as thou may se by Hely the hye pressed etc. And as the
master has auctorite over his servauntes: even so has he a commaundmente to
govern them. And as the husband is heed over his wife: even so has he
commaundmente to rule her appetites and is damned if he sofre her to be an
whore and a miss lyver / or submit himself to her and make her his heed. And
eve^ in like manner as god makes ye ki^ge heed over his realm eve^ so geveth
he him co^mau^dment to execute the laws upon all men indifferently. For the
law is Gods and not the kings. The king is but a servaunte to execute the law
of god and not to rule after his own imaginacion.

I showed also that the law and the king are to be feared / as things that
were geven in fire and in tho^der and lightening and terreble signs. I showed
the cause why rulers are evell and by what means we might obtain better. I
showed also how wholesome those bitter medicines evyll princes are to right
Christen men.

I declared how they which God has made governers in ye world ought to rule
if they be christian. They ought to remember ye they are heedes and arms / to
defend ye body to mynister peace health and wealth and eve^ to save ye body /
and yt they have received their offices of god to mynister and to do service
unto their brethern. Ki^ge subject / Master servau^te / are names in ye
world: but not in christ. In Christ we are all one and eve^ brethern No man
is his own but we are all christ's servau^tes bought with christ's blood.
Therefore ought no man to seek him self or his own profit: but Christ and
his will. In Christ no man rules as a king his subjects or a master his
servauntes: but serves as one hand does to a another and as the hands do
unto the fete and the fete to the hands / as thou seist.j. Cori. xij. We also
serve not as servau^tes unto masters: but as they which are bought with
Christ's blood serve Christ him self. We be here all servauntes unto
Christ. For what so ever we do one to a another in Christ's name that do we
unto Christ / and the reward of that shall we receave of Christ. The king
counts his comens Christ him self and therefore does them service willingly
seeking no moare of them then is sufficient to mayntene peace and unite and to
defend the Realm. And they obey again willingly and lovingly as unto
Christ. And of Christ every man seeks his reward.

I warned the judges that they take not an ensample how to minister their
offices / of our spiritualte / which are bought and sold to do the will of
Satan: but of the scripture whence they have their auctorite. Let that which
is secret abide secret till God open it / which is ye judge of secrets. For it
is moare then a cruel thing to break up in to a man's heart and to compel him
to put either soul or body in ieoperdy or to shame him self. If Peter ye great
pillar for fear of deeth forsook his master / ought we not to spare weke
consciences?

I declared how ye King ought to rydde his realm from the wily tyrany of ye
ypocrites and to bring ye ypocrites under his laws: ye and how he ought to
be learned and to hear and to look apo^ ye causes hi^ self which he will
punysh and not to beleve ye ypocrites and to geve them his sword to kill whom
they will

The king ought to count what he has spent in the Popes quarrel sens he was
king. The first viage cost upon.xiiij. hundred thousand pounds. Reken sens
what has be spent by see and land between us and french me^ and scotts and
then in tryhumphes and in Ambasiasies and what has been sent out of the Realm
secretly and all to mayntene our holy father / and I doubt not but that will
surmounte the some of.xl. or.l. hundred thousand pounds. For we had no cause
to spend one penny but for our holy father. The king therefore ought to make
them pay this money every farthinge / and fette it out of their myters /
croses / shrines and all manner treasure of the church / and pay it to his
comens again not that only which the Cardinal and his Bysshopes compelled the
comens to lend and made them swear with soch an ensample of tyranny as was
never before thought on: but also all that he has gadered of the^. Or else by
the consent of the comens to keep it in store for the defense of the Realm.
Ye the king ought to look in the cronicles what the popes have done to
kings in time past and make them restore it also / And ought to take away
from them their lands which they have gotten with their false prayers and
restore it unto the right heirs again or with consent and advisemente turn
them unto the mayntenynge of the pore and bringynge up of youth virtuously and
to mayntene necessary officers and ministers for to defend the commonwealth.

If he will not do it: the^ ought the comens to take patience and to take it
for Gods scorge and to think that God has blinded the king for their sins
sake and commit their cause to God: And then shall God make a scorge for the^
and dryve the^ out of his temple after his wonderful judgment.

ON the other side I have also uttered the wekednes of ye spiritualte / ye
falsheed of the bysshopes and tugguli^ge of the Pope / and how they have
disgysed the^ selves / borowi^ge some of their po^pe of ye Jews and some of ye
ge^tyles / and have with sotyll wyles turned ye obedience that should be geve^
to Gods ordinance unto them selves. And how they have put out Gods testame^te
and Gods truth and set up their own tradicions and lies / in which they
have taught the people to beleve and there by sit in their consciences as God
/ and have by that means robbed the world of lands and goods / of peace and
unite / and of all temporal auctorite / and have brought the people in to the
ignorance of God and have heped the wrath of God upon all realms and namely
upon the kings. Whom they have robed (I speak not of worldly things only)
but even of their very natural wits. They make them beleve that they are
most Christen / when the lyve most abhominably and will sofre no man in their
Realms that beleveth on Christ / and that they are defenders of the faith /
when the burn the Gospel and promyses of God / out of which all faith
springs.

I showed how they have mynistred Christ / king and Emperor out of their
rowmes / and how they have made them a severell kingdom which the got at the
first in deceavynge of princes / and now perverte the whole scripture to prove
that they have soch auctoryte of God. And lest the lay men should se how
falsely the allege the places of the scripture / is the greatest cause of this
persecucion.

Confession*
They have feigned confession for the same purpose to stablysh their kingdom
with all. All secreates know they thereby. The Bysshope knows the confession
of whom he lusts through out all his dioses. Ye and his chaunceler commands
the gostly father to delyver it written. The Pope / his Cardinals and Bisshopes
know the confession of the Emperor kings and of all lords. And by confession
they know all their captives. If any beleve in Christ / by confession they
know him. Shrive thy self where thou will / whether at sion charterhousse or
at the observauntes thy confesson is known well enough. And thou / if thou
beleve in Christ / art waited upon. Wonderful are the things that thereby
are wrought. The wife is feared and compelled to utter not her own only but
also the secrettes of her husband and the servaunte the secrets of his
master. Besides that through confession the quench the faith of all the promises
of God and take away the effect and virtue of all ye sacraments of Christ

They have also corrupt the saints lyves with lies and feigned miracles and
have put many things out of the sentence or great curse / as reysinge of rent
and fines and hyringe men out of their houses / and what soever wekednes they
them selves do and have put a great part of the stories and chronicles out of
ye way lest their falsheed should besene. For there is no myscheve or disorder
/ whether it be in the temperall regime^te or else in the spiritual where of
they are not the chief causes and even the very founteyne and springes and as
we say / the well heed so that it is impossible to preach age^ste any mischeve
except thou begin at them or to set any reformacion in the world except
thou reform them first. Now are they indurate and tough as Pharao and will not
bow unto any right way or order. And therefore persecute they Gods word and
the preachers thereof / and on the other side lie awayte unto all princes and
stere up all misheve in the world and send them to war and occupy their
minds there with or with other voluptuosnes / lest they should have leyser to
hear the word of God and to set an order in their realms.

By the^ is all thing ministerd and by the^ are all kings ruled: ye in every
kings conscience sit they yer he be king and persuade every king what they
lust and make the^ both to beleve what they will and to do what they will.
Nether can any king or any realm have rest for their busynesses. Behold
king Henry the fyft whom they sent out for soch a purpose as they sent out
our kynke that now is. Se how the Realm is inhabited. Axe where the goodly
towns and their walls and the people that was wont to be in the^ are become
and where the blood ryall of the realm is become also. Turn thine eyes
whither thou will and thou shall se no thing prosperous but their sotle
polling. With that it is flowinge water: ye and I trust it will be shortly a
full see.

In all their doings though they prete^de outwardly ye honor of God or a
come^ wealth / their entente and secret council is only to bring all under
their power and to take out of the way whosoever lets them or is to mighty
for them. As when they send the princes to Jerusalem to conquer the holy
land and to fight agenst the Turks. What so ever they pretend outwardly
their secret ente^te is / while the princes there conquer them moare
bysshoperikes / to conquer their lands in the mean season with their false
ypocresy and to bring all under them / which thou may easily perceave by
that they will not let us know the says of Christ. And when they are ones on
hye / then are they tyrauntes a bove all tyrauntes / whether they be turks or
saracenes. How minister they provinge of testame^tes? How causes of wedlock?
or if any man dye intestate? If a pore man dye and leave his wife and half a
dosen young childern and but one cow to find them / that will they have for a
mortuary mercylesse: let come of wife and childern what will. Ye let any
thing be done agenst their pleasure and they w^ll interdite the whole Realm
sparinge no person.

Read the chronicles of England (out of which yet they have put a great part
of their wekednisse) and thou shall find them all ways both tebellious and
disobediente to the kings and also churlysh and vntha^kefull / so that / when
all ye realm gave the king some what to mayntene him in his right / they
would not geve a myte. Consider the story of king John / where I doubt not but
they have put the best and fairest for the^ selves and the worst of ki^ge John
/ For I suppose they make the chronicles them selves. Compare the doings there
of holy church (as they ever call it) unto the learning of Christ and of his
Apostles. Did not the legate of Rome assoyle all the lords of the realm of
their due obedience which they ought to the king by the ordinance of God?
would he not have cursed the king with his solemn pomp / because he would
have done that office which God commands every king to do and wherefore God
has put the sword in every kings hand? that is to wete / because king John
would have punished a weked clerk that had coynned false money The lay me^
that had not done half so great fautes must dye / but the clerk must goo
scapfre. Sent not the Pope also unto the king of France remission of his
sins to goo and co^quere king Ihons realm. So now remission of sins
comes not by faith in the testame^te yt God has made in Christ's blood: but
by fyghtinge and murtheringe for the popes pleasure. Last of all was not king
John feign to delyver his crown unto the legate and to yield up his realm unto
ye Pope / wherefore we pay Peter pe^ce. They might be called ye pollinge pe^ce
of false prophets well enough. They care not by what myscheve the come by
their purpose. War and conqueringe of lands is their hervest. The wekeder
the people are the moare they have the ypocrites in revere^ce / the moare they
fear the^ and the moare they beleve in the^. And they that conquer other men's
lands / when they dye / make the^ their heirs / to be prayed fore for ever.
Let there come one conquest moare in the realm / and thou shall se the^ get
yet as much moare as they have (if they can keep down Gods word that their
iuggulinge come not to light) ye thou shall se them take the realm hole in
to their hands and crown one of the^ selves king thereof. And verily I se no
other lykelyhode / but that the land shall be shortly conquered. The stars of
the scripture promise us none other fortune / in as much as we deny Christ
with the weked Jews and will not have him regne over us: but will be still
childern of darkness under Antichrist and Antichrists possession / burning the
Gospel of Christ and defe^dynge a faith that may not stond with his holy
testament.

If any man shede blood in the church / it shall be interdited / till he have
paid for the halowi^ge. If he be not able the parysh must pay or else shall it
stand all ways interdited. They will be avenged on them that never offended.
Full well prophesied of them Paul in ye second pistle to Timothe. iij. Some man
will say / would thou that me^ should fight in the chruch unpunished? Nay
but let the king ordeyne a punishmente for them / as he does for them that
fight in his palace and let not all the parish be troubled for ons fault. And
as for their halowi^ge is the iuggelinge of Antichrist. A Christian man is the
temple of God and of the holy ghost / and hallowed in Christ's blood. A Christen
man is holy in him self by reason of the sprite that dwells in him and the
place wherein he is / is holy be reason of him / whether he be in ye field or
town. A christian husband sanctifies an unchristian wife and a christen wife
an unchristian husband (as concerning the use of matrimony) says Paul to the
Corinthians. If now while we seek to be hallowed in Christ / we are found
vnwholy and must be hallowed by the ground or place or walls / then died
Christ in vain. How be it Antychrist must have where with to sit in men's
consciences and to make them fear where is no fear and to rob them of their
faith and to make them trust in that can not help them / and to seek holiness
of that which is not holy in it self.

After that the old king of ffraunce was brought down out of Italy / mark
what pageauntes have be played and what are yet a playenge to separate us from
the Emperor (lest by the help or aid of us he should be able to recover his
right of the Pope) and to couple us to the French men whose might the Pope ever
abvseth to keep the Emperor from Italy. What prevayleth it for any king to
mary his daughter or his son or to make any peace or good ordinance for the
wealth of his Realm? For it shall no longer last then it is profitable to
them. Their treason is so secret that the world can not perceave it. They
dissimill those things which they are only cause of and simyll discord among
them selves when they are most agreed. One shall hold this and a another shall
dispute the contrary: But the conclusion shall be that most maynteyneth their
falsheed / though Gods word be never so contrary. What have they wrought in
our days / ye and what work the yet / to the perpetual dishonor of the
king and rebuke of the Realm and shame of all the nation in what so ever
Realms they goo?

I uttered unto you partly the malicious blindness of the Bisshope of Rochester
/ his iuggelinge his conveyenge / his foxy wilenes / his bo^epe / his wrestynge
/ rentinge and shamfull abvsinge of the scripture / his oratory and alleginge
of heretics and how he would make the Apostles auctours of blind ceremonies
without significacion contrary to their own doctrine / and have set him for an
ensample to judge all other by. What so ever thou art that read this. I
exorte the in Christ / to compare his sermon and that which I have written and
the scripture together and judge. There shalt thou find of our holy fathers
auctorite / and what it is to be great and how to know the greatest.

The^ follows ye cause why lay me^ ca^ not rule temperall offices which is
the falsheed of the Bisshopes. There shall thou find of miracles and
cerimonyes without significacion / of false annoyntynge and lyenge signs and
false names and how the spiritualte are disgised in falsheed / and how they
roll the people in darkness and do all thing in the latin tongue and of their
pety pyllage / Their pollinge is like a sokynge consumcio^ where in a man
complayneth of feebleness and of fayntynes and wotteth not whence his discease
comes: it is like a pocke that freateth inward and consumes the very mary of
the bones.

There seyst thou the cause why it is impossible for kings to come to the
knowleage of the troth. For the sprites lay awayte for them and serve their
appetites at all points and through confession by and sell and betraye both
them / and all their true friends and lay beytes for them and never leve them
till they have blinded them with their sophistry and have brought them in to
their nets. And then when the king is captive they compel all the rest with
violence of his sword. For if any man will not obey them be it right or
wrong they cite him / suspende him and curse or excomunicate him. If he then
obey not they delyver him to Pilate / that is to say / unto the temporal
officers to destroy him. Last of all there fyndest thou the very cause of all
persecucion / which is the preachinge agenst ypocrisy.

Then come we to the sacraments / where thou seyst that the work of the
sacrament saves not / but the faith in the promise which the sacrament
signyfieth justifies us only. There have thou that a pressed is but a servaunte
to teach only and what so ever he takes upon him moare then to preach and to
mynister the sacraments of Christ (which is also preachinge) is falsheed.

Then comes how they iuggle through dome ceremonies and how they make
marchaundice with feigned words / penance / a pena et a culpa / satisfaccion /
attricion / character / purgatory pyckepurse and how through confession they
make the sacraments and all the promise of none effect or valve. There seist
thou yt absoluinge is but preachinge the promises and cursinge or
excommunicatinge preachinge the law / and of their power / and of their keys /
of false miracles and of prayenge to saints. There seist thou that ceremonies
did not the miracles but faith: eve^ as it was not Moses rod that did the
miracles but Moses faith in the promise of God. Thou seist also that to have a
faith where God has not a promise is ydolatrye. And there also seist thou how
the Pope exalts him self above God and commands him to obey his tyranny.
Last of all thou have there that no man ought to preach but he that is called.

Then follows the belly brotherheed of monks and freres. For Christ has
deserved naught with them. For his sake gettest thou no favor. Thou must
offer unto their belyes and then the pray bitterly for the. There seist thou
that Christ is the only cause: ye and all the cause why God does ought for us
and hears our complaynte. And there have thou doctrine how to know and to be
sure that thou art elect and have Gods sprite in the. And have there learning
to try the doctrine of our spirits.

The^ follow the four senses of the scripture of which three are no senses and
the fourth that is to wete the literal sense which is the very sense has the
Pope taken to him self. It may have no other meaning then as it pleases his
fatherhode. We must abide his interpretacio^. And as his belles tynke so must
we think / though it be impos^ible to gather any soch meaning of the
scripture. Then have thou the very use of allegoryes and how they are nothing
but ensamples borrowed of the scripture to express a text or an open
conclusion of the scripture and as it were to paynte it before thine eyes /
that thou may feale the meaning and the power of the scripture in thine
heart. Then comes the use of worldly similitudes / and how they are false
prophets which bring a worldly similitude for any other purpose / save to
express moare plainly that which is contained in an open text. And so are
they also which draw the scripture contrary to the open places and contrary to
the ensample lyvinge and practisinge of Christ / the Apostles and of the holy
Prophets. And then finally have thou of our holy fathers power and of his
keys and of his byndinge and excomunicatinge and of his cursynge and blessinge
with ensamples of every thing.
