Clods Carroll: or, A proper new Iigg, to be sung Dialogue wise, of a man and a
woman that would needs be married.
To a pleasant new Tune.
Man. NOw in the Garden
are we well met,
To crave our promise,
for promise is a debt.

Wom Come sit thee down all by my side,
and when that thou art set,
say what then will unto me.

M. Show me unfeignedly,
and tell me thy mind,
For one may have a young wench
that is not ouer-kind.

W. Seek all the world for such a one,
then hardly shall you find
a Love of such perfection.

M. This single life to wearisome,
feign would I marry:
But fear of ill choosing
makes me to tarry:
Some says that flesh is flexible,
and quickly it will vary.

W. It Is very true, God mend them.

M. Why speak thou ill of women,
since thou thy self art one?

W. Would all the rest were constant
save I my self alone.

M. Faith, good or bad, or howsoever,
I cannot live alone,
but needs I must be married.

W. To marry with a young wench,
she will make thee poor with pride:
To marry with one of middle age,
perbaps she has been tried:
To marry with an old one,
to freeze by fire side;
both old and young are faulty.

M. I Will marry with a young wench,
of beauty and of wit.

W. It is better tame a young Colt,
without a curbing bit.

M. But she will throw her rider down.

W. I true, he cannot sit.
when Fillies fall a wighing.

M. I Will marry one of middle age,
for she will love me well.

W. But if her middle much be used,
by heaven and by hell;
Thou shall find more griefs
than thousand tongues can tell:
Ah, silly man, God help thee.

M. I Will marry with an old wench,
that knows not good from bad.

W. But once within a fortnight
she will make her husband mad.

M. Beshrew thee for thy counsel,
sor thou have made me sad:
but needs I must be married.

W. To marry with a young wench,
me thinks it were a bliss:
To marry one of middle age.
it were not much amiss.
I Would marry one of old age,
and match where money is;
there is none are bad in choosing.

M. Then thou for all thy saying,
commendst the single life.

W. I, freedom is a popish
banishment of strife.

M. Hold thy tongue fond woman,
for I must have a wife.

W. A Cuckold in reuersion.
When you are once married
all one whole year,
Tell me of your fortune,
and meet with me here:
To think upon my counsel
thou will shed many a tear;
till which time I will leave thee.

M. Were I but assured,
and of a Beggars lot,
Still to live in misery,
and never worth a groat,
To have my head well furnished
as any horned Goat;
for all this would I marry.
Farewell you lusty Batchelors,
to marriage I am bent:
When I have tried what marriage is,
I Will tell you the event;
And tell the cause, if cause there be,
wherein I do repent,
that ever I did marry.

FINIS.
The second part, To the same tune.
W. Good Morrow to thee new married man,
how do thou fare?

M. As one quite marred with marriage,
consumed and filled with care:
Would I had taken thy counsel.

W. But thou would not beware.

M. Alas, it was my fortune.

W. What grief does most oppress thee?
may I request to know?

M. That I have got a wanton.

W. But is she not a shrew?

M. She Is any thing that evil is,
but I must not say so.

W. For fear that I should flout thee.

M. Indeed to mock at misery,
would add unto my grief.

W. But I will not torment thee,
but rather lend relief:
And therefore in thy marriage,
tell me what w^es are chief;
good counsel yet may cure thee.

W. Is not thy huswife testy,
too churlish and too sour?

M. The devil is not so waspish,
she is never pleased an hour.

W. Can thou not tame a devil?
lies it not in thy power?

M. Alas I cannot conjure.

W. What, goes she not a gossiping,
to spend away thy store?

M. Do what I can, I promise you,
she is ever out of door;
That were I nere so thrifty,
yet she would make me poor:
woes me I cannot mend it,

W. How goes she in apparel?
delights she not in pride?

M. No more than Birds do bushes,
or hearts the river side,
Witness to that, her looking-glass,
where she has stood in pride
a whole fore-noone together.

W. How think then? was she honest,
and loyal to thy bed?

M. I think her legs do fall away,
for spring time keeping head.
And were not horns invisible,
I warrant you I were sped
with broad browed Panthers.

W. Thy grief is past recovery,
no salve will help but this:
To take thy fortune patiently,
and brook her w(...)t she is.
Yet many things amended are,
that have been long amiss;
and so in time may she be.

M. I cannot stay here longer,
my wife or this does stay:
And he that's bound as I am bound,
perforce must needs obey.

VV. Then farewell to thee new married man,
since you will needs away;
I can but grieve thy fortune.

M. All you that be at liberty,
and would be void of strife:
I speak it on experience,
never venture on a wife,
For if you match, you will be matched
to such a weary life,
that you will all repent you.

FINIS.
