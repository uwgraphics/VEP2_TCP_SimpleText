The Turtle Dove. Or, The wooing in the Wood, being a pleasant new Song of two
constant Lovers.
To the tune of, the North Country Less.


When Flora she had decked
the fields with flowers fair,
my love and I did walk abroad,
to take the Pleasant air.
Fair phoebus brightly shind,
and gently warmd each thing:
Where every creature then did seem,
to welcome in the Spring.
Into a pleasant grove,
by Nature trimly made:
My Love and I together walked,
to cool us in the shade.
The bubling brooks did glide,
the silver fishes leap:
The gentle Lambs and nimble Fawnes
did seem to leap and skipe,
The Birds with sugured notes,
their pretty throats did strain:
And Shepherds on their oten pipes,
made music on the plains.
Then I began to talk,
of Lovers in their blis:
I wood her and courted her,
for to exchange a kiss.
With that she straight way said,
hark how the Nigtingale,
Although that she does sweetly sing.
does tell a heavy tale.
That in her maiden years,
by man she had much wrong:
Which makes her now with thorn inbrest
to sing a mournful song.
With that I lent an ear,
to hear sweet Philomell.
Amongst the other Birds in woods,
and she this tale did tell.
Fair maids be warnd by me,
I was a maiden pure.
Until by man I was orereacht,
which makes me this endure.
To live in woods and groves,
sequestered from all sight:
For heavily I do complain,
both morning, noone, and night.
The Threstle-cock did say,
fie, Phil^* you are to blame:
Although that one did do amiss,
Will all men do the same.
No quoth the Ousell then,
though I be black of hew:
Unto my mate and dearest love,
I always will prove true.
The Blackebird having spoke,
the Lark began to sing:
If I pertisipate of ought,
my love to it I bring.
The Mag-pie up did start,
and straight began to chatter:
Believe not men they all are false,
for they will lie and flatter.
Then up upon a leaf,
the Wren leapt by and by,
And said bold Parrat your pide-coate,
shows you can cog and lie.
The Second part.
To the same Tune.
THen Robin-Redbrest said,
It Is I in love am true:
My couller shows that I am he,
if you give me my dew.
No, said the Linet then,
your breast it is to yellow:
For let your love be never so true,
you lethinke you have a fellow.
Another bird start up,
being called the Popengay,
And said fair Mistress view me well,
my coat is fine and gay,
Away with painted stuff,
the Field fare did say:
My couller it the abourne is,
and bears the bell away.
The Goldfinch then bespake,
my coullours they are pure:
For yellow, red, for black, and white,
all weathers will endure.
Each bird within the wood,
a several sentence gave:
And all did strive with several notes,
pre-eminence to have.
Then from an Iuie bush,
the Owl put forth her head
And said, not such an other Bird
as I, the wood has breed.
With that each Bird of note,
did beat the Owl away:
That never more he durst be seen,
to stay abroad by day.
And then they all agreed,
to choose the Turtle Dove,
And that he should deside the cause,
betwixt me and my love.
Who thus began to speak,
Behold sweet maiden fair:
How my beloved and my self,
do always live a pair.
We never use to change,
but always live in love:
We kiss and bill, and therefore called,
The faithful Turtle Dove.
And when that each does die,
we spend our time in moan,
Bewayling our deceased frind,
we live and die alone.
We never match again,
as other birds do use:
Therefore sweet Maiden love your
do not true love refuse.
Thus ending of his speech,
they all did silent stand,
And then I turned me to my love,
and took her by the hand
And said, my dearest sweet,
behold the love of these:
How every one in his degree,
do seek his ma^^ to please.
Then fairest grant to me,
your constant heart and love:
And I will prove as true to thee,
as does the Turtle Dove,
She said here is my hand,
my heart and all I have:
I kissed her, and upon the same
a token to her gave.
And then upon the same,
the Birds did sweetly sing:
That echoes through the woods and groves,
most ^owdly then did ring.
Then up I took my Love,
and arm in arm did walk:
With her unto her fathers house,
where we with him did talk.
Who soon did condescend
when we wear both agreed
And shortly to the church we went,
and married were with speed.
The Bells aloud did ring
and Minstrels they did play
And every Youth and maid did strive,
to grace our wedding day.
God grant my love and I,
may have the like success:
And live in love until we die,
in joy and righteousness.
FINIS.
