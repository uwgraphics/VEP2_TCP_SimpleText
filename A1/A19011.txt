The politic Maid.
OR, A dainty new ditty,
both pleasant and witty:
Wherein you may see,
the maids policy.

To a pleasant new tune.
THere was a Knight was wine drunk,
as he rode on the way,
And there he spide a bonny Less,
among the Cocks of Hay:
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
This gallant Knight unto the Less,
did present take his way,
But it seemed he had a shame face,
he did not Court and play:
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
When he came to this bonny Less,
he found she was not coy,
His courtesy she did embrace,
and did not say him nay:
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale
with hey tro nonney nonney.
If we should sit us down here,
upon the grass so green,
Here Is neither sheet nor covering,
to keep our clothes clean:
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
And if we should sit down quoth he,
among the Cocks of hay,
Then would come forth the Kings Pinder,
and take our steedes away:
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
I have rings on my fingers,
made of the purest gold,
That will release our steedes again
out of the Kings pinfold:
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
The second part
To the same tune.
SIR Knight if you will go with me,
into my Fathers Bowers,
There may you sit and talk with me,
this three or four hours:
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
When she came to her Fathers Bowers,
they were moted round about,
Then she slipped in at a wicke.
and left Sir Knight without:
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
Now I am here a maid within,
and you Sir Knight without,
You may lay straw under your feet
to keep you from the gout:
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
Henceforth when you do meet a maid
a mile out of the town,
Sir Knight you must not be afraid,
of soyling of her gown:
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
And if you chance to meet a maid,
amongst the Cocks of hay,
Sir Knight you must not be afraid,
with her to Court, and say
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
It is a proverb many say,
and truth it is in trial,
He that will not when as he may,
shall after have denial:
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
And thus Sir Knight now fare you well,
to you I bid adieu,
Now you hereafter wards may tell
how I have served you.
Sing loud, whistle in the wind,
blow merry merry merry,
Up and down in yonder dale,
with hey tro nonney nonney.
FINIS.
