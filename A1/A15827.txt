To the Religious Student of the Art of Well-liuing.
THou may (Christian Reader) after thou have studied, and well perused this
short Sum of Religion, purchase to thy self (if thy purse and pains will
suffer thee) the learned Theology and Divinity of that worthy man of God Mr
Alexander Richardsonne. This may be for preparation, that will be for further
perfection. Heb. 6.1. Leaving the beginning of Christ, let us go on to
perfection. It is a shame ever to be under the spoone, and never to use the
knife. Ever learning, and never to come to the knowledge of the Truth. 2. Tim.
3.7. Yet soft and sure is the best pace. Leap-Christians (like horsecoursers
Iades) gallop into profession, and then shamefully tire and give in. It lames a
weak Child to use limbs too soon, and overmuch forwardnes argues no
perpetuity. Learn we then first to go easily, and afterward to run with
speed the ways of Gods Commandments.

The Catechism defined, and distributed.
CHAPTER I. Of Faith in God.
Question.

WHat inducements to Religion are prefixed before your Catechism?

Answer.

Four, first, the giving up of my name to God in Baptism, and that in the
dreadful name of Father, Son, and holy Ghost. Secondly, that being not able
to give it up my self, it was done by others, according to the ancient
custom of the Church, ever conioyning Baptism and Confession together, Math.
3.6. Aug. Epist. 24. Papists would have it to contract spiritual kindred, but
surely it makes honest love amongst neighbors. Thirdly, They that gave it up
for me, did promise in my name that I should live according to Religion.
Fourthly, I believe in conscience that I am bound to perform what they have
promised. Thus because I am Gods, and bound to him by sureties, vows,
promises, and Conscience it self, It is my duty being now come to years of
discretion, to learn to believe in him, and obey him.

Q. What then is Religion?

A. It is the acknowledgement of the truth which is after godliness, Tit. 1.1.

Q. What are the parts?

A. Faith and Works; the sum of the one is contained in the Creed: of the
other in the ten Commandments, Lords prayer, and the Sacraments. Tit. 3.8.

Q. What is Faith?

A. A confidence in God, grounded upon knowledge, Ioh. 16.30. We know and by
this believe.

Q. How is Faith grounded upon knowledge?

A. In regard of God and his Church: the maker of the Covenant, and the people
with whom it is made. Ier. 31.33.

Q. How in respect of God?

A. As we believe in one God, and three persons for our happiness, Ioh. 14.1.

Q. How in one God?

A. In respect of nature, essence, and being. Deuteronomy. 4.35.

Q. How in three persons?

A. Three in regard of divine revelation, or real respects in that one most
pure essence Mat. 28.19.

Q. What is the essence?

A. That whereby God is of himself, the most absolute and first being, Isa.
41.4.

Q. What is a person?

A. That one pure pure God with the relation of a Father, Son, and holy
Ghost, 1. Ioh. 5.7.

Q. Does the relation add any thing to the essence?

A. Nothing but respect or relation, as Abraham the Father of the faithful
has the same nature as he is a Father and as he is a man.

Q. What is the Relation?

A. It is either to send or be sent, and both these are done either by nature,
or counsel. Ioh. 15.26. the spirit proceeds from the father and son by
nature, and is sent to us by counsel.

Q. Is there no other relation?

A. Yes, either to beget or be begotten, and the father begets his only son
by nature, and the rest of his children by counsel. Heb. 1.3. Iam. 1.18. A man
having the relation of a father is said to beget children by nature or
counsel, as adopted children are freely begotten, not of the body but the
will. Iam. 1.18. Of his own will begat he us, not so his only son, who is
as natural to his Father, as burning to the fire, and as Isaac to Abraham.

Q. What then is the first person?

A. God the father, who by nature begets his son, and by his counsel creats
the world. Heb. 1.2.5.

Q. What is the property of the Father?

A. To beget, and not to be begotten. Ioh. 3.16.

Q. What is his manner of subsisting?

A. To be the first person; for the begetter is before the begotten, and yet
being Relatiues they are together in nature, for no man is a father before he
have a son, though in order the father be first.

Q. What is the fathers work?

A. Creation; for, I believe in him as maker of heaven and earth: and the
reason is because he is the first person, to whom the first work belongs.

Q. What is Creation?

A. A work of the Father, who of himself by his son and spirit, makes the
world of nothing exceeding Good. Genesis 1.31. Heb. 1.3.

Q. What is given to the Father in respect of Creation?

A. Almighty power; for the Father in himself is pure act, which act is power
as it may be felt of his creatures, which are in power to be.

Q. What is omnipotency?

A. It is that whereby the Father is able to do all that he does, and more
then he does, if it contradict not his own nature or the nature of things.

Q. How is Creation divided?

A. Into heaven and earth. Genesis 1.1.

Q. What mean you by heaven?

A. The third heaven, with the Angels, both which were made perfect in the very
first beginning of time. Genesis 1.1.

Q. What mean you by earth?

A. All that matter which was closed and compassed about with the third heaven,
and was made at the same instant with it to prohibit and keep out vacuitie,
or emptiness, and fill up the whole compass of it, otherwise the parts of
themselves would have fallen together to have kept out that enemy of nature.
Genesis 1.1.

Q. Are we to understand no more by earth then that first matter?

A. Yes, we are to understand the forming of it into the four elements, fire,
air, water, and earth; as likewise the filling of if and them with
inhabitants, beth above and below: as also the providence of the Father in
preserving and governing of them all to their ends and vsee: for the Father
carries the work according to his proper manner of working, until we come to
Redemption, and there the son takes it upon him in a peculiar manner.

Q. What is the second person?

A. The son, who is begotten of the Father by nature, and by counsel,
redeemes mankind.

Q. What is the relative property of the son?

A. To be begotten. Heb. 1.5.

Q. What is his manner of subsisting?

A. To be the second person in order, not in nature, for the begotten in
relation is naturally as soon as the begetter.

Q. What is his work?

A. Redemption. Ephesians 1.7.

Q. What is Redemption?

A. It is a satisfaction made to the Justice of God the Father for Man by a
Redeemer.

Q. Who is the Redeemer?

A. Jesus Christ, his only son our Lord.

Q. Why call you him Jesus?

A. Because he is a Savior of his people from their sianes. Math. 1.21.

Q. Why Christ?

A. In regard of his offices, as he is anointed our King, Priest, and Prophet.
Psalm. 45.7. Luke 4.18. Act. 4.27. and 10.38.

Q. Why his only Son?

A. Because the Father can have no more sons by nature but one

Q. Why our Lord?

A. By the right of Redemption. Romans 14, 9.

Q. How is our Redemption wrought?

A. By the humiliation and exaltation of the Son of God. Luke 24.26.

Q. What be the several degrees of his humiliation?

A. Seven, there be some others left out of the Creed; but these expressed are
the principal.

Q. What are they?

A. 1. His conception, 2. his nativitie, 3. his passion under Pilate, 4. his
crucifying, 5. his dying, 6. his burial, 7. his descent into hell.

Q. What are meant by all these?

A. That Christ must not only satisfy in general, but that he must pass
through the degrees of our sorrows, and bear our afflictions. Isa. 53.4.5.

Q. What be the several degrees of his exaltation?

A. Four, which are his Resurrection, Ascension, Sitting at Gods right hand,
and return to Judgment. As in his humiliation he took our receipts, and
tasted the bitter potion for us, so all physic being ended of that kind, he
gives us his receipts of Redemption, Ephe. 1.7. Justification. Romans 3.24.
Reconciliation. Colos. 1.20. Sanctification. 1. Pet. 1.2. Entrance into glory.
Heb. 10.19. these are Cordials for us, and for him after all his penal receipts.

Q. What is the third person?

A. The holy Spirit. who by nature proceeds from the Father, and the Son,
and by counsel applies Christ to the Church and every member thereof, the
Father being the first person elects, the Son redeemes, and the Spirit
sanctifies. Ioh. 14.26. and 15.26. Romans 8.16. 1. Cor. 2.12. John 3.5. 2. Cor.
1.21. Romans 8.23.

Q. What is his Relative property?

A. To Proceed. Understanding begets an Image of it self, and loves it, and
so from the best understanding to the best object of it, proceeds a mutual
love. The begetter loves the begotten, and the begotten loves the begetter, and
their love is equal to themselves, and proceeds from them both, and to us.
The will of the Father, by the wisdom of his Son, and power of his good
Spirit is said to do all.

Q. What is his manner of subsisting?

A. To be the third person in order, for proceeding from two, he must needs
be the third, and yet in nature as soon as either of them; for the lovers and
the loved, are Relatiues, and therefore together in nature.

Q. What is his work?

A. Application, or Sanctification. Ephe. 5.26.27. The Son having prepared
the remedy, leaves it to be applied by the Spirit, John 16.7.

this Union is made by Faith, it is called the militant Church, as by vision,
the triumphant.

Q. Why is it called holy?

A. Because it is an holy Society of Saints in regard of the Spirits work. 1.
Pet. 2.9. Reu. 11.2. and 21.29.

FINIS.
The Conclusion.
HItherto (Industrious and painful Reader) I have but brought thee to the top
of Mount Nebo, and with this prospectiue glass, have given thee the general
veiw of the land of Canaan. If thou will be pleased (with the Spies sent out by
Moses) to enter further, and send forth the Scouts of thy Soul, to make larger
discoueries, thou shall find the depthes of diuiniue more fully sounded
concerning thy faith in one God three persons: and after thou art entered
further into the Continents, and have coasted the shores plied up the frythes,
thou shall discover the inhabitants of heaven and earth, their qualities,
tempers, regiment of life, their diet, employment etc. I mean, thou shall
find in some good measure, how richly, God has furnished the world, in what
excellent manner he governs it, especial his great care for thee and thy
happiness. In essence he is simply one, yet has he made himself many
attributes, so that what thou can not conceive by one act of understanding,
thou may the better perceive by many: Thou shall see the persons delighting
themselves above all things in thee and thy salvation, and accordingly put
forth themselves in all their works of Creation and Providence, thou shall find
again thy duty and debt to God for all his favors: for if God shed abroad (
Romans 5.5) his love in thy heart, then must thou of necessity love him again:
No man goes to his bed and warmes it with his own heat, but he looks for
heat again: So, God resting in the heart, looks for love out of it, 1 Timothy
1.5. In a word, I shall be glad, if by this, and the other, I shall make the
Art so easy for thee, that thou may reap thy profit by it. And thus (as by
a letter of advertisment from the coast of Canaan) I cease thy further trouble,
never ceasing to pray for thee.

Thine in Christ Jesus, as his own, JOHN YATES.
