Roaring Dick of Dover: OR, The Iouiall good fellow of Kent,
That never is willing to give over,
Till all his money be spent.

To the tune of Fuddle, roar and swagger.


HEeres a health to all good fellows,
that intend with me to join,
At the Tavern, or the Alehouse,
and will freely spend their quoyne.
But for such as hate strong liquor,
are not for my company,
O it makes my wits the quicker,
when I taste it thoroughly.
I can fuddle, roar and swagger,
sing and dance in several sort,
And give six peuce to a beggar,
in all this there is little hurt.
Whilst some churl that's worth a million,
will give naught in charity,
But to himself he proves a villain:
judge who is better he or I.
There Is many men get store of treasure,
yet they live like very slaves:
In this world they have no pleasure,
the more they have, the more they (...).
Hang such greedy-minded misers,
that will never contented be,
I have heard by good aduisers,
that con^ent lives merrily.
Wherefore should we live in sorrow,
since we may embrace true joy
To day alive, and dead to morrow,
as most commonly they will say.
He is a fool that pin^s his carkais*
if he have to s^rue his turn,
And perhaps sometimes in darkness,
grafted is his head with horn.
He Is no right true-hearted fellow,
that in company will drink,
Till such time as he is mellow,
and not freely spend his chinke.
Let such sharking base companions.
be kicked out of company*
For they be but beastly hang on^s;
and will call, but we must pay.
Come my Lads, be blythe and merry,
sing and drink and trace your ground,
And let us have a cup of Sherry;
that (me think^) ^oes kindly down.
Lets not spare whilst we have money,
for ^o pay for what ^e call,
We needs must spa^e when we have not any,
that is the greatest plague of all.
The second part, To the same tune.


HOnest Hugh, Tom, Will and Harry,
they will join their money round,
Kate, Nan, Besse and bouncing Mary,
will no^ shrink, but still are sound.
They are Lads and honest Lasses,
that to each others are kind,
They Will sing and roar, break pots and glasses,
when their heads are tipped with wine.
Some men's wives will brawle and wrangle,
if their husbands spend a pot,
But my self I will entangle,
with a Less to pay my shot.
I do hate these base conditions
of a deuillish scolding Queen,
Jealous heads have bad suspicion,
you may think o^ (...) (...) mean.
Women (...) let me intrea^ you,
that you will not brawle (...) scold,
For it makes your husbands beat you,
some men will not be contrould,
Therefore rest your selves contented:
best I hold it so to be:
In your minds be not tormented:
but take part as well as he.
Me thinks it is a worldly pleasure,
for to have a wife prove kind,
It Is a joy beyond all measure*
(...) ^y (...) the same do find.
If I had a scolding creature,
I should never merry be,
(...) I many times should beat her,
with her I could not agree.
Tapster, come and take thy reckoning,
tell me k^^^ly what is to pay,
Yet Pieces in my pockets rattling,
bid me longer ^hr^ to stay,
Come bring a pipe of good Tobacco,
let it be the very best,
That's the thing that here we take so,
then come drink with us thy guests.
Hang up sorrow, I can borrow
money for to buy two pots,
Who can say to live to morrow?
then let us never sit like sots.
When I have spent away my money,
I will go and work for more,
And I have a kind sweet honey
that sometimes will pay my score.
He that has abundant treasure,
hence shall nothing bear away:
Then let us take some part of pleasure,
drink and sing and freely pay.
Whilst our time and money lasts,
let us not prove Curmudgeon boores,
Time indeed away it hastes:
come let us go and pay our scores,
Thus for to conclude my Ditty,
heeres a health to all true blades,
Remembering, Kate, Nell, Sis, and Betty,
and all other kind true Maids:
I love Meg, Nan, Alice, and Mary,
Jane, and Ione, and my fine Doll,
With Winifred, and my sweet Sara.
Thus, kind hearts, I leave you all.
FINIS.
