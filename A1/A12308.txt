A certain Relation of the Hogs-face Gentlewoman, called Tannakin Skinker, who
was borne at Wirkham, a neuter Town between the Emperor and the Hollander.
PRodigies have bin in many or the most times, and prodigious births almost in
all ages. For the first, the best Authors affirm, that when the Tarquins were
banished Rome, a Serpent was heard to bark, and a Dog to speak; and that in
the second punick War, an Ox pronounced these words, Cave tibi Roma. Three
Suns were seen at once* when Spurius Posthumus and Quintus Nimutius were
Consulls; and three Moons when Curious Dometius, and Lucius Aneus bore the like
Authority: Milk and blood, Wool, and pieces of Flesh have dropped from the
Clouds upon the earth in several showers; burning Shields have bin seen in
the air; shattering fire from the setting of the Sun, to the break of day;
with a noise of the clashing of armor, and the sound of Trumpets, and other
Military instruments. etc. And in the Mutinensian Fields, two great Mountains
removed the one toward the other, and fought a terrible combat; fire and
smoke being seeing to issue from either, in whose meeting all the neighbor
and adjacent Villages, were not only shaken, but utterly demolisht; and all
the Animals both men, and beasts, within many furlongs of that prodigious
conflict, were exeminated and slain. Infinite almost are the Histories of the
like presidents, which for brevities sake I omit; let therefore these few
suffice for many.

I come now to prodigious Births, of which this woman now in agitation is the
sole Argument; and that it may appear the more probable, to any that shall
call the truth thereof in question; I shall entreat such but to look back
into the Histories of the times past. Herodatus, and diverse Authors have left
recorded; that when Xerxes first prepared his Invincible Army to invade Greece,
a Mare instead of a Colt, brought forth an Hare, which was a presage of his
flight, and base defeat. In the year of Grace one thousand four hundred
fifty six, Calixtus the third, then being Pope, a Cow brought forth a Calfe
with two heads, and bodies incorporate in one; and in the Isle of Cous in
Greece, an Ewe, of the flock of one Nicippus an Heardsman, eaned a Lion; which
was as a prediction that he should attain to the Sovereignty thereof, which
accordingly happened; neither need we much to question these, when our own
Native soil, and these our Modern times, have produced the like brutish
monsters; publicly to be seen in all parts of the City and Suburbs, etc.

But I come now to humane Births, beginning with those foreign, and ending
with the domesticke; about the beginning of the Marsick War, one Alcippe, a
woman of especial note, at the time of her childing, was delivered of an
Elephant; and another (whose name is not left unto us of) a Serpent. In
Thessaly, one was brought to bed of an infant which had the shape of an
Hypocentaure, and expired the same day that it received breath. And in the
year that Haniball beseiged and utterly subverted Sagunthus: a woman of the
same City brought forth a Son, which was no sooner borne, but voluntarily and
of its own accord, crept back into the mothers womb.

Albertus Magnus writes of a woman in Germany, who brought into the world from
her own body fifty sons, five at a birth, but not any of them lived to be
three quarters of a year old. And Avicen tells us of another who was
delivered of two and twenty abortive Children at several times, of all which
not one of them breathe one vital Air.

I fall now immediately upon the party before propounded. In a place in Holland,
called Wirkham, being a neuter Town; as lying betwixt Holland and those parts
belonging to the Empire, on the River Rhine, lived on Ioachim Skinker, whose
wife name was Parnel, a man of good revenue, but of a great estate in money and
cattle: these two having very lovingly lived together, without any issue, to
succeed them in their goods and inheritance: it being, no small grief unto
them, that either strangers, or some of their own ungrateful Kindred should
after death enjoy those means, for which they had so laboriously travailed:
when they were in their greatest despair, it happened thus, she found her self
conceived with child, which was a greater joy and comfort to her and her
husband: But whether they were unthankful for such an unexpected blessing, or
what other thing was the cause, I am not able to determine: but so it happened,
that in the year 1618, she was safely delivered of a Daughter, all the limbs
and lineaments of her body, well featured and proportioned, only her face,
which is the ornament and beauty of all the rest, had the Nose of a Hog, or
Swine: which was not only a stain and blemish, but a deformed ugliness, making
all the rest loathsome, contemptible and odious to all that looked upon her in
her infancy.

If the joy of the parents was great in the hope of a Child, how much greater
may we conjecture their sorrows were, to be the parents of such a monster:
but considering with themselves what Heavens would have, they had not power to
hinder, and studying (as far as in them lay) to conceal their shame, they so
far mediated with the Mid wife and the other women that were present at the
delivery, that they should keep it as close and secret as it was possible to
do: and they called the name of it Tannakin, which is as much in English as
Anne, or Hann^h.

This prodigle Ravisius Textor also remembers us of a female Monster called
Marin, who from the navill upward, had the effigies of a fair and beautiful
woman, but from thence downward had the true shape of a well proportioned Mare,
with four feet, a tail, and every limb and member corresponding to an
Equinall figure, who lived an hundred 23 years. In the Bishopric of Colen a
woman, some think a Witches Curse, some otherwise, brought forth into the
World at one birth one hundred threescore and five children: all which though
they were of wondrous small stature, yet they were borne with life, and
christened, and a monument remaynes for them to this day, her prayer or curse
being, that she might have as many children at one birth, as there were days
in the year. Monsters have been borne within these few years in Virginia, New
England, and other Colonies of our own Plantation, of which it is now too long
to insist. And the like prodigious is now, that a Gentleman of quality within
these month died, who being opened, in his heart was found a worm in the
form of a Serpent, which stretched out, was found to be sixteen inches long.

But if we shall be any way jealous of the trruth of reverent Antiquity, let us
but look back upon our selves, I will give unto you a few instances for many:
not to speak of those which have preposterously come into the world with their
Feet forward, and born with Teeth in their head, as Richard the Third of that
name King of England, and others. Twin Children have been borne amongst us
with two heads and bodies from the Gird lested upward, and but two legs and
feet to support them both, and when one of them dyed, the other survived, but
not many hours after: A Scotch child, about two years since, was to be seen
in Barthlomew Fair, a Girl about the age of seven years, who was so hairy,
hands, arms, face, and body, that you would have thought Orson to have bin her
Father, and some she Bear her mother, yet had she her speech, senses, and all
other deportments of a child of her age; who had bin well educated and
instructed. But to leave all digression and come to the purpose now in hand, I
will only remember unto you a very handsome young man, late (if not now) in
Town, whose picture has bin publickely set out to the common view, and
himself to be seen for money; who from one of his sides has a twin brother
growing, which was borne with him, and living still * though having sense and
feeling, yet destitute of reason and understanding: whence me thinks a
disputable question might arise, whether as they have distinct lives, so they
are possessed of two souls; or have but one imparted betwixt them both: but of
this let the Philosophers, or rather the Divines argue and Define, being I must
ingeniously confess an Argument much above my element.

This prodigious birth though it was known to some few, yet was it not made
popular and spoken of by all, which the Father and mother, for their own
reputations and credits were very careful to maintain; so that it was never
seen by any (being an infant barefaced) but vaild and covered, and so brought
up in a private Chamber, both fed and taught by the Parents only; and her
deformity scarce known to any of the Servants: and as the daughter grew in
stature, so the Father also increased with wealth; so that he was accounted to
be one of the richest men in all that Country. Now how she came to be borne
with such deformity, there be diverse and sundry conjectures; but if we may
Judge the cause by the effect, and of the preceedent by the subsequent; most
probable it is that it came by Witchcraft: And that there be such, we have
manifest proof; for in Skedam in Holland, there is scarce a man or woman but
they are either Magi, or Sagae; that is, men or women witches: but for the last
we need no further witness, then that of the Lancashiere witches some few
years since; of which I make no doubt, but this whole City has taken
especial notice of. etc. Now whether Witches have power to effascinate an
inant in the womb of the mother, may be a question; of which after some
illustrations by known examples (without any tedious Deviation) I hope to
gain the Reader ample satisfaction.

History tells us that the Witch Circe, the daughter of Sol, and the Nimphe
Persae, who dwelt not far from Caietu, a City of Campania, by her sorcerous
Spells and Incantations, changed diverse of Ulysses his companions into Swine:
if she had such power over the whole, no wonder then if a Witch in these days,
by the help of her Father the Devil, cannot disguise the face which is but a
part. It has been known also in our known Country, when a Gentlewoman of
good descent and quality has brought an infant into the World with a live
Snake wrapped about the neck and body: in memory of which, that Noble Family in
the emblazon of their Arms, give the Snake ever unto this day: which accident
is quite against nature, and therefore can be conferred upon nothing but
Diabolical Sorcery and Witchcraft. I could tell you of the like prodigious
things done by Medea, Micale, Erecto Magun, Dipsas, Aeriphala, Locusta,
Guthurna, Canidia Neopolitana, Sagana, Vera, Folia, and infinite others: but
though I study brevity, give me leave to give thee this short Character.

Their power is by the permission of the higher powers, and instigated by the
malice of the Devils, to transhape men into beasts; make barren fields, blast
Corn, unfructify Trees, parch and wither Grass and Herbs; bring scabs and
diseases upon men, and murraine and rot upon Herds and Flocks: effascinate
the eyes, weaken the hands, benumbe the feet etc. Now to prove that this Child
was bewitched in the womb, there be these pregnant reasons following.

It is credibly reported, that this Burgers wife having conceived, an old woman
suspected for a Witch, came to beg of her an Alms, but she being at the
busied about some necessary affairs gave her a short and neglectfull answer;
at which she went away muttering to her self the Devils pater noster, and was
heard to say; As the Mother is Hoggish, so Swinish shall be the Child she
goes withal: which is a great probability that the infants deformity came by
the malicious Spells, and divelish murmurations of this wicked woman; who after
for the like, or worse practices both upon men women and children, whom she
had bewitched unto death, being brought within the compass of the Law; and
after to suffer at the stake: amongst many other things confessed as much as I
have before related; yet either out of her perverse obstinacy would not, or
else (the Devil forsaking her in extremity, as he does all his other
servants) in her deficiency of power, could not uncharme her: yet by this means
that which was before kept so private, was now publicly discovered to the
World; insomuch that much confluence of people came to see the progedy, which
wearied the Father, and cast a blush upon the cheeks of the good woman the
mother: some desirous to hear her speak, whose language was only the Dutch
Hoggish Houghs, and the Piggs French Owee, Owee, for other words she was not
able to utter; which bred in some pity, in others laughter, according to their
several dispositions.

Others were importunate to see her feed, then milk and the like was brought
unto her in a silver Trough; to which she stooped and eat, just as a Swine
does in his swilling Tub; which the more mirth it bred in the Spectators,
increased in the Parents the more melancholy: insomuch that he bethought
himself to find out some means, (if it were possible) either to mend or end
his sorrows. And to that purpose, hearing of a famous Artist, who was both a
Mathematician, and an Astrologian (whose name was Vandermast) and lived not
far from him; a man who was suspected to have bin well verst in black and
hidden Arts* to him he repaired, and when he had made known his griefs by
every circumstance; he desired of him some present remedy, for which he would
be no way ungrateful.

Who after some pause told him, that after some hours attendance he would
return him an answer, the one way or the other; which gave him some small
satisfaction, though not full to his expectation: but having waited his
leisure, he returned according to the time prefixed, told him that he could
wish him to marry her at any rate whatsoever; for whilst she continued in the
estate of a Virgin, there was no hope of her recovery; but if then she received
any help, or he comfort, though both seemed beyond all hopes; yet he advised
him patiently to attend the success, but howsoever not to match her unto
Clown, Bore, or Pesant; but to a gentleman at least. In which answer though he
could presume of nothing (being so mistericall and doubtful,) yet there was no
reason for him to despair of any thing: so that having bountifully rewarded
the Artist, he repaired back to his own house, and acquainted his wife with
the passage of the whole business; where they long consulted betwixt
themselves, what were best in this difficult case to be done.

After much reasoning Pro and Con, they concluded to put her into very rich and
costly habit (but her face still vaild and covered) and to give out that what
gentleman of fashion or quality soever, would take her to his bed after loyal
Matrimony, (for she was at this time betwixt sixeteene and seventeene years of
age, and therefore marriageable) should receive for a Dowry with her, forty
thousand pound, paid down in Starling and Current money. This was a bait
sufficient to make every Fish to bite at, for no sooner was this publickely
divulged, but there came Suitors of all sorts; insomuch that his Gates were
thronged as at an Outcry, or rather as a Lottery, every one in hope to carry
away the great Prize of forty thousand pound; for it was not the person, but
the prize at which they aimed.

One thinks with him self, so the body be handsome, though her countenance
be never so course and ugly, all are alike in the night; and in the day time,
put her head but in a black bag, and what difference betwixt her and another
woman. Another comfort him self thus: That if she cannot speak, she
cannot chide; and therefore he shall be sure not to have a scold to his wife.
Another apprehends, That if she feed but one wash and the like, she will not
be very chargeable to him for her Diet; and therefore he shall have a good
bargain by the match.

These and the like inducements were so far prevalent with them, that they
came from diverse places, and Countries, to solicit her for marriage: some from
Italy, some from France, some from Scotland, some from England, and every one
of them howsoever debosht in their means, and more studdying upon her means
then the maid, put all their Fortunes upon the hazard of an handsome suite, to
appear like gentlemen; because otherwise they could have no admittance into
her company.

But to give you better information, then by these suppositians, or rather
stupid conceits for her order of Diet; She does eat all those meats which
commonly we do feed on, and does digest it very naturally; only she does
feed in a Silver Trough, or Bole; which is always carried with her
wheresoever she does remove: and if she does want any thing that she has a
mind unto, be it Apparel, or Diet, she does write her mind; and by that
means, (as we are given to understand, by those which have seen her) she
has all things to her desire.

Amongst some Suitors came a Scotch man being a Captiane, who having hazarded
the greatest part of a months pay upon one Suite of Clothes, was desirous to
see this Gentlewoman, and was received by the Parents; who thinking him to be
some great Leard in his Country, gave him generous entertainment: she was
brought unto him with her face covered, and in an habit which might well have
fuited the greatest Lady in the Land; who admiring her feature and proportion,
was much inamoured of her person, but desirous to see her face discovered, when
he beheld it; he would stay no other conference, but ran away without further
answer, saying; they must pardon him, for he could endure no Porke.

Next came a Sowce-man, borne in England having accomodated himself for the
same adventure, and presuming that loving Sowce so well, no Hogs-face could
affright him; he presently at the sight of her could endure her company no
longer, and at his farewell, said, so long as I have known Rumford, I never saw
such a Hogsnout, but whenever my stomach shall serve for any such dish, I
will never venture upon any raw, but I will be sure it shall be either well
boiled or roasted.

A Tailor came, having borrowed (whether with leave, or without I know not) a
costly suite of one of his best customers: and he vowed notwithstanding, all
impediments whatsoever interdicting him, he would enjoy her, and marry her,
and sleep with her close as Hogs in pease-straw, but though he liked her
feature when her face was discovered, he gave back, and vowed he would not go
through stitch with any such business. I should but lose my self in writing,
and tire the Reader in turning over many Voluminous leaves of paper, to show
you here many several men and of sundry conditions, came in a kind of
jealousy one of another, to purchase this mass or magazine of money: every
one ambitious after the portion, but not one amongst them amorous of the
person, whose countenance was so far from seeming lovely to them, that it
appeared altogether loathsome, and so I will leave her in this exigent, to
acquaint you with a short story, that the carriage of the one, may make the
other appear more probable, they being of like affinity. My Author is John
Gower, and thus it happened.

A noble and warlike Knight, Cousin to the Emperor Claudius, of a spirit
undaunted, and honor unquestioned, named Florentius, as he rid upon an
adventure, was taken prisoner by a Captain of a Castle, whose son he had
before slain in battle, willing they were to put him to death, but they much
feared the indignation and revenge of the Emperor his Uncle: and he being
then in their power, they held a consultation amongst themselves what was best
to be done, and where diverse projects were laid: the mother to this Captain,
and Grandmother; to Bruncus before by him slain, said, That she had a plot to
make him accessory to his own death without any displeasure from the Emperor
or any of his noble Allies, nay, that he himself should assent thereunto
without the least taxation of any injustice.

And to that purpose, she sent for him out of prison, and thus said: Though for
the death of my Grand child, Bruneus both his Father and my self might take
just vengeance of thee, since thy life is forfeited into our hands. Yet upon
condition, that thou will resolve me of one question, which I shall propound
thee: thou shall have liberty for three months, but if not in that space thou
can not give a full solution of my demand, thou shall here take thy personal
oath as thou art a Knight, to return back again unto this Castle, where thou
art now our prisoner and vassal, and yield thy self up to a voluntary death,
freely acquitting us of the fact to thine Uncle the Emperor.

This being concluded, as well by oath as obligation in writing, sealed and
subscribed, the question was, What thing above all other, women most desire?
Imagine him now free, on horseback, and in his way to Court, where being
arrived, and demanding of the wisest and gravest Philosophers, and others to be
resolved in this point, and withal telling them of his own danger, if it were
not answered. Every one were of several opinions: one said Pleasure, another
Pride, some that they desired most to be praised and flattered, so that in this
diversity of censures, he was forced to depart thence unsatisfied: now he whose
honor was more precious unto him then the preserving of a thousand lives,
resolved to yield up his body according to covenant, and riding through a
Forest, some few leagues distant from the Castle, pondring a thousand things
in his perplexed head, he casting his eye aside, spied an old withered and
decrepit Hag of the most ugly and loathsome aspect that ever his eyes beheld,
who stepping unto him, and taking his horse by the bridle, said: Florens I know
thee, and that thou art now going to thy certain death, but be advised by me,
and (upon condition) I will save both thy life and honor: Blame him not, if
being now in his flourishing youth, he gave her a willing care, and cheerfully,
demanded of her what gift she would have? or what task impose him? who
presently answered: That when he had resolved the Beldam of her question (by
her means) and had gained his life and liberty, he should return to that
place where he then found her, and from thence bear her to his place of
residence, and make her his wife.

Which when he heard he was now in a double distraction, as preferring many
deaths before such a loathsome and unequal match: and so left her without
reply. But better considering with himself, that being so old she could not
live long; and being married, it was in his power to mew her up from the sight
of men: with other the like apprehensions, (and life being sweet) he turned
back, and swore by his Kinight-hood, he would do all that she demanded: which
being agreed betwixt them, she told him, that when the question was again
propounded: What thing above all other, women most desire? he should answer, To
have their Wills, and the Sovereignty over their Husbands. Let us Imagine that
by this he was acquit, though to the great indignation both of the Father and
the Grandam, and came back according to his Covenant, where he met with the
former Hagge, of whom my Author in his old English, gives this description.

She was the loathedst wight
That ever man cast on his Eye:
Her Nose baas, her brows hye;
Her Eyes small, and deep set,
Her Cheeks been with tears wet,
And rivling as an empty skin,
Hanging down unto the Chin:
Her Lips shrunken bin for age,
There was no grace in her visage:
Her Front was narrow, her looks hoar;
She looks forth as does a More, etc.
In whose sight she was so odious, that now he repents him that he had not
suffered Death rather then to be so miserably disposed of. But she still
urging him upon his Knightly promise, he was forced in her torn and thredbare
habit to take her up behind him: but so ashamed of his burden, that he only
travailed either through woods, or by Owle-light, till at length he came to
his own Castle, where necessity (though much against his will) compelled him
to discover her unto the Lady his sister, and other of his near Allies, who
were all much astonished and grieved at his wretched fortune.

But she still hastening on the match, the day of marriage came, when the Ladies
striving to trick her up in the richest habit and best ornaments they could
devise, the more they strived to beautify her, the more ugly and deformed she
appeared. Briefly, married they were, and bedtime came, heaven knows to his
small comfort, and less content: the Bride-chamber was prepared, and the
rooms, according to the Brides appointment stuck full of lights. The doors are
shut, to bed she goes, and urges him to make haste, and do the office of an
husband: who was no sooner laid by her side, with as much distance as was
possible, she plucked him by the arm, and desired him to reach a Light; and if
she could receive no other favor at his hands, yet at least once more to
look upon her, and she would then acquit him of his promise.

This seeming to be an easy condition, he takes a light, and looking
steadfastly upon her, he discovered a sweet young Lady of an incomparable beauty
and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life
time beheld: at which strange sight being much extasied, he grew as greatly
Inamoured, insomuch, that he began to court her, and offered to kiss her,
etc. But she modestly putting him back, said to him as follows: Sir, I am
indeed no other than I now seem unto you; and of these two things I give you
free choice, whether I shall appear to you thus as you now see me, young,
fair, and lovely in your bed, and all the daytime, and abroad, of my former
deformity: or thus beautiful in the day, to the sight of your friends, but in
your arms every night of my former Age and Ugliness: of these two things I
give you free choice of, which till you have resolved me, there can be no other
familiarity betwixt in: therefore without pause give me a speedy answer.

This more then all the rest distracted him: For what was her beauty to him in
the night, if she appeared to all his friends so loathsome by day? or what was
her rare feature to him, either abroad amongst his friends, or at board, if she
were so odious to him in bed? therefore he said unto her: Sweet and delicate
Lady, I am confounded in your question; nor know I what to answer; but into you
own hands and choice I give the full power and sovereignty to make election of
which you best please: At which words she lovingly turned toward him, and
said: Now Sir, you have given me that which all women most desire, my Will, and
Sovereignty; and know I am the Kings daughter of Sicily, who by a wicked and
sorcerous step-dame was thus enchanted, never to return to my pristine shape,
till I was first married, and after had received such power from my Husband *
And now from henceforth I shall be the same to you night and day, of that youth
and livelihood which you now see me; till Time and Age breed new alteration,
even to the last period of my life. At which, how incredible his joy was, I
leave to the opinion of the understanding Reader, who I hope will easily
conceive what affinity this story may have with the former.

I should have spoken something of her residing in or about London, as of her
being in Blackfriars or Covent Garden, but I can say little: only abundance
of people do resort to each place to enquire the truth: some have protested
they have seen her, by the help of their acquaintance, and give this reason
why she will not as yet be constantly in one place, because the multitude is so
great that do resort thither, that they dare not be known of her abiding,
least by denying the sight of her, they that owe the house should have it
pulled down about their ears. Her portion is very large, it being 40000
pounds; she likewise goes very gallant in aparrell, and very courteous in her
kind to all. And whosoever shall in Pamphlet, or Ballad, write or sing
otherwise than is discoursed of in this small Tract, they err from truth: for
what is here discovered, is according to the best, and most approved
intelligence.

FINIS.
