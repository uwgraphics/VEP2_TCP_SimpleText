Cum gratia and Privilegio Regia Majestatis.

Veni Creator*
^ COme holy ghost eternal God, proceeding from ^ abo^e* both from the Father
and the son, the ^ God of peace and love: Visit our ^indes and in- ^ to us,
thy hea^enly grace inspire, that in all truth? ^ and godlynes, we may have true
desire.

Thou art the very comforter,
in all woe and distress:
The heavenly gift of God most high,
which no tongue can express.
The fountain and the lively spring,
of joy celestial:
The fire so bright, the love so clear,
and unction spiritual.
Thou in thy gifts art manifold,
whereby Christ's Church does stand,
In faithful hearts writing thy law,
the finger of Gods hand.
According to thy promise made,
thou geuest speech of grace:
That through thy help the praise of God,
may stand in every place.
O holy Ghost into our wits,
se^d down thy heavenly lights
Kindle our hearts with seruent love,
to serve God day and night.
Strength and stablish all our weakness,
so feeble, and so frail:
That neither ^^esh, the world, nor depill,
against us do prevail.
Put back our enemies far from us,
and grant us to obtain
Peace in our hearts with God and man,
without grudge or disdain.
And grant (O Lord) that th^n being
our leader, and our guide^
We may eschew the snares of sin,
and from thee never slide.
To us such pl^nty of thy grace,
good Lord grant we thee pray:
That thou may be our comforte^,
at the last dreadful day.
Of all strife and dissension,
O Lord dissolve the bandest*
And make the knots of peace and love,
throughout all Christen lands.
Grant us (O Lord) through thee to know,
the Father of all might:
That of thy dear beloved son,
we may attain the sigh^.
And that with perfect faith also,
we may acknowledge thee:
The spirit of them both always,
one God in persons thr^^.
Land and praise be to the Father,
and to the Son equal*
And to the holy spirit also*
one God coet^rnall:
And pray we that the only Son,
vouchsafe his spirit to send:
To all that do prof^ss^ his name,
unto the worlds end.
The humble suit of a sinner. M.
^ O Lord of whom I do depend behold my care- ^ full heart, and when thy will
and pleasure is, release ^ me of my smart, thou see my sorrows what they ^
are, my grief is known to thee, and the^^ is none ^ that can remove, or take
the ^ame from me.

But only thou whose aid I crave,
whose mercy still i^ pressed:
To ease all those that come to thee,
for succor and for r^st.
And since thou see my restles eyes,
my tears and grievous groan*
Attend unto my suit (O Lord)
mark well my playnt and moan.
For sin has so enclosed me,
and compast me about^*
That I am now remediless,
if mercy help not ou^.
For mortal man can not release,
or mitigate this pain:
But even thy Christ, my Lord, and God,
who for my sins was slain.
Whose bloody wounds are yet to see,
though not with mortal eye:
Yet do thy saints behold them all,
and so I trust shall ^.
Though sin does hinder me a while,
when thou shall see it good:
I shall enjoy the sight of him,
and see his wounds and blood.
And as thine Angels and thy Saints,
do now behold the same*
So trust I to possess that place,
with them to praise thy name.
But whilst I live here in this vale,
where sinners do frequent,
Assist me ever with thy grace,
my sins still to lament*
Least that I wo^d in sinners trace,
and give them my consent
To dwell with them in wickedness,
where to nature i^ b^nt.
Only thy grace must be my stay,
least that I fall down ^lat:
And being down then, of my self
can not recover that.
Wherefore this is yet once again
my suit and my request:
To grant me pardon for my sin.
that I in thee may re^t.
Then shall my heart, my tongue, and voice,
be instruments of praise:
And in thy Church, and house of Sainte^,
sing Psalms to thee always.
Venite exultemus. Psalm. xcv.
Sing this as the Benedictus.
O Come, and let us now rejoice,
And sing unto the Lord:
And to out only Savior,
Also with one accord.
O let us come before his face,
With inward reverence:
Confessing all our former sins,
And that with diligenc^.
To thank him for his benefits,
Always distributing:
Where fore to him right joyfully,
In Psalms now let us sing.
And that because that God alone,
^s Lord magnificent:
And eke above all other Gods,
A king omnipotent.
His people does not he forsake,
At any time or tide:
And in his hands are all the coa^tes,
Of all the world so wide.
And with his loving countenance,
He looks every where:
And does behold the tops of all
The mountains far, and near^.
The Sea and all that is therein
Are his, for he them made,
And eke his hands have fashioned
The earth which does not fade.
O come therefore and worship him,
And down before him fall:
And let us weep before the Lord,
The which has made us all.
He is our God, our Lord, and king,
And we his people are:
His flock and sheep of his pasture,
On whom he takes care.
This day if ye will hear his voice,
Yet harden not your ha^tes:
As in the ^itter murmuring,
When ye were in desartes.
Which thing was of their negligence,
Committed in the time
Of trouble, in the wilderness,
A great and gr^^ous crime.
(...) your Fathers tempted me,
And ^^yed ^^e every ^ay^
They proved me and saw my works,
What I could do or say.
(...)
Wh^^ all this generation*
And evermore I say it they (...),
I^ their imagination.
Wherewith their (...) we^e (...)
Long time, and many days*
Wherefore I know assuredly.
They have not known my ways.
To whom^ I i^ ^^ine anger swor^^
That they should not be blessed:
No^ see my joy c^lestiall,
Nor enter in ^y rest.
Gl^ri^patri.
All lau^ and praise be to thee Lord*
O that of mig^^ art most:
To God the Father and the son,
And to the holy Ghost.
As it in the beginning was,
For ever heretofore:
And is now at this present time,
And shall be evermore.
The song of Saint Ambrose called ^e Deum.
^ WE praise thee God, we knowledge thee, the ^ only Lord to be, And as
eternal father all the ^arth ^ does worship thee. To thee all Anngels cry, the
^ heavens and all the powers therein: To thee Ch^ruh ^ and S^raphin, to cry they
do not linne.

O holy, holy, holy Lord,
of Sabbath Lord the God,
Through heaven and earth thy praise is spread*
and glory all abroad.
Thapostles glorious company,
yield praises unto thee:
The Prophets goodly fellowship,
praise thee continually.
The noble and victorious host
of Martyrs sound thy praise:
Thy holy Church throughout the world,

Father of endless Majesty,

The holy Ghost the comforter*
Of glory thou ar^kyng

The song of Zacharias, called Benedictus.
^ THe only Lord of Israel, be praised euermors, ^ For through his visitation
and mercy kept inst^rer ^ His people now he has redemde, that long has ^ been
in thrall, and spread abroad his saving health, ^ upon his servants all.

In ^^^uids house ^i^ seruaant true,
(...) to his mynder*
And also his ^^noynted ^yng,
As we in Scripture find^.
As by his holy Prophets all,
Often times he did declare:
The which were since the world began,
His way for to prepare.
That we might be delivered,
From those that make debate:
Our enemies, and from the hands,
Of all that do us hate.
The mercy which he promised,
Our Fathers to fulfill:
And think upon his covenant made,
According to his will.
And also to perform the o^^e,
Which he before had sworn
To Abraham our Father dear,
For us that were ^orlorne.
That he would give him self for us,
And us from bondage bring
Out of the bands of all our foes,
To s^rue out heavenly king.
And that without all manner fear,
And eke in righteousness:
And also for to lead our life,
In steadfast holiness.
And thou (O child) which now art borne,
And of the Lord elect:
Shall be the Proph^^, of the highest,
His ways for to direct.
For thou shall go before his face,
For to prepare his ways:
And also for to teach his will,
And pleasure all thy days.
To give them knowledge, how that their
Salvation is nere:
And that remission of their sins,
Is through his mercy mere.
Whereby the dayspring from on hye,
Is come us for to visit.
And those for to illuminate,
Which do in darkness fit.
To lighten those that shadowed be
With death, and eke oppressed,
And also for to guide their feet.
The way to peace and rest.
The song of blessed Mary called Magnificat.
^ MY soul does magnify the Lord, my spirit ^ eke evermore, reioyseth in the
Lord my God, which ^ is my Savior, And why? because he did regar de, ^ and
gave respect unto so base estate of his hand- ^ maid, and let the mighty go.

For now behold all nations,
And generations all:
From this time forth for evermore*
Shall me right blessed call.
Because he has me magnified,
Which is the Lord of might.
Whose name be ever sanctified,
And praised day and night.
For with his mercy and his grace,
All (...) he does inf^ame:
Throughout all generations,
To such as fear his name.
He showed strength with his great arm,
And made the proud to start:
With all imaginations,
That they bare in their heart.
He has put down the mighty ones,
From their supernall seat:
And did exalte the meek in heart,
As he has thought it meet.
The hungry he replenished,
With all things that were good:
And through his power he made the rich,
Often times to want their food.
And calling to rememberaunce,
His mercy every deal:
Has helped up assistantly,
His servant Israel.
According to his promise made,
To Abraham before:
And to his seed successively,
To stand for evermore.
The song of Simeon, called Nunc dimi^tis.
^ O Lord because my hearts desire, has wished ^ long to see my only Lord,
and Savior, thy son ^ before I dye. The joy and health of all mankind ^
desired long before, which now is come into the ^ world, of mercy bringing
store.

Thou suffer thy servant now,
In peace for to depart:
According to thy holy word,
Which lighteneth my heart.
Because mine eyes which thou have made,
To give my body light:
Have now beheld thy saving health,
Which is the Lord of might.
Whom thou mercifully have set,
Of thine abundant (...)
In open figh^ and visible,
Before all peoples face.
The Gentiles to illuminate,
And Satan ouerquell:
And eke to be the glory of,
Thy people Israel.
The Symbol, or Creed of Athanasius, called Quicunque vult.
^ WHat man soever he be that salvation will at- ^ taine, The Catholic
belief he must before all ^ things retain, Which faith unless be ^oly
keep, ^ and vndefiledly, without all doubt eternally he ^ shall be sure to dye.

The Catholic belief is this,
that God we worship one
In Trinity, and Trinitye
in unity alone.
So as we neither do confound
the persons of the three:
Nor yet the substance whole of one,
in funder parted be.
One person of the Father is,
an other of the Son*
An other person proper of
the holy Ghost alone.
Of Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
but one the Godhead is:
Like glory, coeternall eke
the majesty likewise.
Such as the Father is, such is
the Son in each degree:
And such also we do believe,
the holy Ghost to be.
Uncreate is the Father, and
(...) uncreate is the Son:
The holy Ghost uncreate, so
uncreate is each one.
Incomprehensible Father is,
incomprehensible Son:
And comprehensible also is,
the holy Ghost of none.
The Father is eternal, and
the Son eternal sot
And in like sort eternal is,
the holy Ghost also.
And yet though we believe that each
of these eternal be:
Yet there but one eternal is:
and not eternalls three.
As (...) incomprehensible we,
ne yet vncreats three:
But one incomprehensible, one
uncreate hold to be.
Almighty so the Father is,
the Son almighty so:
And in like sort almighty is,
the holy Ghost also.
And albeit that every one,
of these almighty be,
Yet there but one almighty is,
and not almightyes three.
The Father God is, God the Son,
God holy Ghost also:
Yet are there not three Gods in all,
but one God and no more.
So likewise Lord the Father is,
and Lord also the Son:
And Lord the holy Ghost, yet are,
there not three Lords, but one.
For as we are compeld to grant,
by Christian verity:
Each of the persons by himself,
both God, and Lord to be:
So Catholic Religion,
forbids us always:
That either Gods be three, or that
there Lords be three to say.
Of none the Father is ne made,
ne create, nor begot:
The Son is of the Father, not
create, n^ made, but got.
The holy Ghost is of them both,
the Father and the Son,
Ne made, ne create, nor begot,
but does proceed alone.
So we one Father hold, not thre^,
one Son also, not three:
One holy Ghost alone, and not
three holy Ghostes to be.
Non^ in this Trinity before,
nor after other is:
Ne greater any then the rest,
ne lesser be likewise.
But every one among themselves,
of all the persons three:
Together coeternall all,
and all coequall be.
So Unity, in Trinity,
as said it is before:
And Trinity, in Unity,
in all things we adore.
Therefore what man so ever that
salvation will attain:
This faith touching the Trinitye,
of force he must retain.
And needful to eternal life,
it is that every wight.
Of the incarnating of Christ
our Lord, believe aright.
For this the right faith is, that w^
believe, and eke be know:
That Christ our Lord, the Sonn^ of God,
is God and man also.
God of the Fathers substance go^,
before the world began:
And of his mothers substance, borne
in world a very man.
Both perfect God, and perfect man,
in one, (...) Jesus Christ:
That does of reasonable soul,
and human flesh subs^^t.
Touching his Godhead, equal with
his Father God is h^:
Touching his manhood, lower then
his Father in degree.
Who though he be both very God,
and very man also:
Yet is he but one Christ alone,
and is not persons two
One, not by turning of Godhead,
into the flesh of man:
But by taking manhood to God,
this being one began.
All one, not by confounding of
the substance into one:
But only by the unity,
that is of one person.
For as the reasonable s^^le,
and flesh but one man is:
So in one person God and man,
is but one Christ likewise.
Who suffered for to save us all,
to hell he did descend.
The third day rose again from death,
to heaven he did ascend.
He s^^tes at the right hand of God,
thalmighty Father there:
From thence to judge the quick and dead,
again he shall retire.
At whose return all men shall rise,
with bodies new restorde^
And of their own works they shall geu^
account unto the Lord.
And they into eternal life
shall go that have done well,
Who have done ill, shall go into
eternal fire to dwell.
This is the Catholic belief,
who does not faithfully
Believe the same, without all doubt
he s^ued can not be.
To Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
all glory be therefore:
As in begin^yng was, is now,
and shall be evermore.
The Lamentation of a Sinner.
^ O Lord turn not away thy face, from him that ^ lies prostrate: Lamentyng
sore his sinful life ^ before thy m^rcy gate. Which gate thou openest ^ wide
to those that do lament the^r sin, shut not ^ that gate against me Lord, but
let me enter i^.

And call me not to mine accounts,
How I have lived here:
For then I know right well (O Lord)
How vile I shall appear.
I need not to confess my life,
I am sure thou can tell
What I have been, and what I am,
I know thou know it well.
O Lord thou know what things be past,
And eke the things that be*
Thou know also what is to come,
Nothing is hid from thee.
Before the heavens and earth were made,
Thou knew what things were then:
As all things ^ls that have been since,
Among the sons of men.
And can the things that I have done,
Be hidden from thee then?
Nay, nay, thou know them all (O Lord)
Where they were done, and when.
Wherefore with tears I come to thee,
To beg and to entreat:
Even as the child that has done evil,
And fears to be beat.
So come I to thy mercy gate,
Where mercy does abound:
Requiryng mercy for my sin,
To heal my deadly wound.
O Lord I need not to repeat,
What I do beg or crave:
Thou know (O Lord) before I ask,
The thing that I would have.
Mercy good Lord, mercy I ask,
This is the total sum:
For mercy Lord is all my suit,
Lord let thy mercy come.
The Lords Prayer, or Pater noster.
^ Our father which in heaven art, Lord hallowed ^ be thy name, Thy kingdom
come, thy will be done ^ in earth, even as the same in heaven is: give us O ^
Lord o^^ daily bread, this day: As we forgive ou^ ^ detters, so forgive our
dettes we pray. Into temp- ^ tation lead us not. From evil make us fr^e. For ^
kingdom, power, and glory thine both now ^ and ever be.

The x. Commandments Audi Israel. Exodus xx.
^ Hark Israel, and what I say give head to un- ^ derstand. I am the Lord thy
God, that brought thee ^ out of Egypt land, even from the house, wherein ^ thou
did in thraldom line a slave. None other ^ Gods at all before my presence
shall thou have.

No manner graven Image shall
thou make at all to thee:
Nor any figure like by thee,
shall counterfatted be
Of any ^hyng in heaven above,
nor in the earth below,
Nor in waters beneath the earth:
to them thou shall not bow,
Nor shall them serve. The Lord thy God
a ielous God am I:
That punish parents faults, unto
the third and fourth degree
Upon those children that me hate,
and mercy do display:
To thousands of such as me love,
and my precepts* obey.
The name thou of the Lord thy God,
in vain shall never use:
For him that takes his name in vain,
the Lord shall not excuse.
Remember that thou holy keep,
the sacred Sabbath day:
Six days thou labor shall, and do
thy needful work^s always.
The seventh day is set by the Lord,
thy God to rest upon:
No work then shall thou do in it,
ne thou, nor yet thy son.
Thy daughter, servant, nor handmayd,
thine Ox, nor yet thine Ass,
Nor stranger that within thy gate,
has his abidyng place.
For in six days God heaven and earth,
and all therein did make*
And after those his rest he did
upon the seventh day take.
Wherefore he blessed the day, that he
for resting did ordain:
And sacred to him self alone,
appointed to remain.
Yield honor to thy parents, that
prolongde thy days may be
Upon the land, the which the Lord,
thy God has given thee.
Thou shall not murder. Thou shall not
commit adultery.
Thou shall not steal. Nor witness false
against thy neighbor be.
Thou shall not covet house that to
thy neighbor does belong:
Ne covet shall in having of
his wife to do him wrong.
Nor his man scruaunt, nor his maid,
nor Ox, nor Ass of his:
Nor any other thing that to
thy neighbor proper is.
The complaint of a sinner.
^ WHere righteousness does say, Lord for my sin- ^ full part. In wrath thou
should me pay, vengeance ^ for my desert. I can it not deny, but needs I
must ^ confess, how that continually, thy laws I do trans- ^ gresse, Thy
laws I do transgress.

But if it be thy will,
With sinners to contend:
Then all thy ^^ocke shall spill,
And be lost without end.
For who lives here so right,
That rightly he can say
He sins not in thy sight,
Full often, and every day.
The Scripture plain telth me,
The righteous man oftendeth
Seven times a day to thee,
Whereon thy wrath depends,
So that the right wise man
Does walk in no such path,
But he falth now or than,
In danger of thy wrath.
Then since the case so stands
That even the man rightwise
Falth often in sinful bands,
Whereby thy wrath may rise,
Lord I that am unjust,
And righteousness none have,
Whereto then shall I trust.
My sinful soul to save*
But truly to that post,
Whereto I clean and shall:
Which is thy mercy most.
Lord let thy mercy fall:
And mitigate thy mood,
Or ^ls we perish all:
The price of this thy blood,
Wherein mercy I call.
The Scripture does declare
No drop of blo^d in thee:
But that thou did not spare
To shed each drop for me.
Now let those drops most sweet,
So moist my heart so dry,
That I with sin replete
My live, and sin may dye.
That being mortified,
This sin of mine in me:
I may be sanctified,
By grace of thine in thee:
So that I never fall,
Into such mortal sin,
That my foes in^ernall:
Rejoice m^ death therein.
But vouchsafe me to keep,
From those in^ernall foe^:
And from that lake so deep,
Whereas no mercy grows,
And I shall sing the songs,
Confirmed with the just:
That unto thee belonges,
Which art mine only trust.

And that my strength may now amend,

But pleased with burnt offeringes,

A broken and an humble heart,

Gra^nt that of thy Jerusalem,

Burnt offringes, gifts, and sacrifice,

Thou shall accept, and Calves they shall

To see if any were that would

They are g^ne all out of the way,

There is not one does any good,

Do not all wicked workers know

My people, as they feed on bread?
the Lord they call not on.
Even there they were afraid, and stood

Where as there was no cause at all
why they should be afraid.
For God his bones that thee beseegd

Thou have confounded them, for they
rejected are of God.
O Lord give thou thy people health,

Then Jacob shall therein rejoice,

From open enemies check and blame,

And did my secret-councell hear,

And we together often did walk,
within the house (...)

and send them quick to hell,
For mischief reigns in their hall,
and parlour where they dwell.

to him for help I flee:

When I so instantly have cry de,

I do not care at all assayes,
what flesh can do to me.

And all the counsel th^^ they take,

Then spy my paths, and s^ares have tide,

For in his wrath he does not let,

Reserve them in a glass by thee,

With joy I will declare abroad,

That to devour me have assayde,

And with such wicked men I dwell,

They wound, and cut with their quick tongue,
like swords and weapons kene.

Exault thy praise on earth abroad,

Wherein they think my soul to snare,
but they are fallen in it.

My heart I say does well accord,

For I my self before the day,

That men may know throughout the world,

Throughout the streets, in every place,

Nor find an house wherein they may,

HOw ever it be yet God is good,

And to all such as safely keep,

my feet began to slide*
And or I wist even at a pinche,
my steps away began glide.

I grudgd and did disdain:
That wicked men all things should have,
without turmoyle or pain.

as if death should them smite:
Their bodies are both stout and strong,
and ever in good plight:

when other men be shent:
And with the rest they take no part
of plague or punishment.

their necks as does a chain:
And are even wrapped as in a robe,
with rapine and disdain.

their eyes often times out start:
And as for worldly goods, they have
more then can wish their heart.

boasting much of their wrong:
Which they baue done to simple men,
and ever pride among.

And prate they do on worldly things,

and cleanse my heart in vain.

as subject to all blame:
And every morning from my youth,
sustain rebuke and shame.

mislyking mine estate:
But that I should thy children judge,
as folk unfortunate.

But yet the labor was to great,
for me to take in hand.

I understood right perfectly,
the end of all these men.

upon a slippery place:
And at thy pleasure and thy will,
thou do them all deface.

to see how suddenly
They are destroyed, dispatched, consumde,
and dead so horribly.

so shall their wealth decay.
Their famous names in all men's fight,
shall ebb and pass away.

my m^nde was much oppressed:

and in this point a beast.

but thee in heaven above:
And in the earth there is nothing,

For of my heart God is the strength,

And those that trust in any thing,
saving in thee alone.

In God alone I put my trust,

The house appointed to thy name,

Then burnt ^hey up in every part,

our Prophets all are gone:
To tell when this our plague should end,
among us there is none.

Shall they always blaspheme thy name,

O pluck it out* and be not slack

With fear am I so sore oppressed,

Or is his promise now delayde,

Of such abundance, that no floudes

Yet more and more they did desire,

his wrath upon them fell:

and choice of Israel.

and still they did him grene:
For all the wonders that he wrongli^,
they would him not believe.

and made their honor vain:
Their years did wast and pass away,

And with their tog^es, and in their hearts,

Nor yet to keep or to perform,

That he forgave them their misdeedes,

Yea many a time he turned his wrath,
and did himself advise:
And would not suffer all his whole

That passes away, and can not well

And filled their countries full of frogs,

And all the labor of there hands,

And not so much as wild fig trees,

And all their flocks and heardes likewise,
with thunder boltes full hot.

and in his fury strong:
Displeasure, wrath, and evil sprites,

and spared not the least:
But gave unto the pestilence
the man and eke the beast.

And all the chief of men, and beasts,

And carried them to wilderness,

Whereas their focs with rage of Sea

Even to the mount which he had got,
by his strong arm and hand.

and did their land divide:
And in their tents he set the Tribes

And would not keep his testament,
nor yet obey his will.

Much like a how that will not bend,

Or like a valiant man of war,

And put them then unto a shame,

As for the tribe of Epliraim,

Even the noble mount Sion,

Which be took up and brought away,

So that there is not one of them,

All Realms which call not on thy name,

And aid us Lord in all assaults,

Of such as are in prison cast,

And will not suffer, certainly,
The sinners and vngodlyes rod,
To tarry upon his family.

Falling to sin and wickedness.

Of thee to speed how should we mis,
In whom our treasure does consist.
To thee for ever more be praise,
With the Father in each respect,
And with thy holy spirit, always,
The comforter of thine elect.

^ Our Father which in heaven art, an^ makst us all ^ one brotherhood, to call
upon thee with one heart our ^ heavenly Father and our God, ^^rau^t we pray not
with ^ lips alone, but with thy heart deep sigh and groan.

Thy blessed name be sanctified,
Thy holy word might us inflame,
In holy life for to abide,
To magnify thy holy name.
From all errors defend and keep,
The little flock of thy poor sheep.
Thy kingdom come even at this hour,
And henceforth everlastingly:
Thine holy Ghoft into us pour:
With all his gifts most plenteously,
From Satan's rage and filthy band,
Defend us with thy mighty hand.
Thy will be done with diligence,
Like as in heaven in earth also,
In trouble grant us patience,
Thee to obey in wealth and woe,
Let not flesh blood, or any ill,
Prevail against thy holy will.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And all other good gifts of thine:
Keep us from war, and from bloodshed,
Also from sickness, death, and pine,
That we may line in quietness,
Without all greedy carefulnes.
Forgive us our offenses all,
Reliene our careful conscience,
As we forgene both great and small,
Which unto us have done offense,
Prepare us Lord for to serve thee,
In perfect love and unity.
O Lord into temptation,
Lead us not when the feend does rage:
To withstand his invasion,
Give power and strength to every age,
Arm and make strong thy feeble host,
With faith and with the holy Ghost.
O Lord from evil delinct us,
The days and times are dangerous,
From everlasting death save us,
And in our last need comfort us,
A blessed end to us bequeth,
Into thy hands our soul receive.
For thou (O Lord) art king of kings,
And thou have power over all:
Thy glory shines in all things,
In the wide world universal.
Amen, let it be done (O Lord)
That we have prayde with one accord.
The xii. Articles of Christian faith.
^ ALl my belief and con^idence, is in the Lord ^ of might: The father which
all things has made, ^ the day and eke the night, the heavens and the fir- ^
mament, and also many a star, the earth, and all that ^ is therein, which pass
man's reason far.

And in like manner I believe,
in Christ our Lord his son:
Coequall with the deity,
and man in flesh and bone.
Conceived by the holy Ghost,
his word does me assure:
And of his mother Mary borne,
yet she a Virgin pure.
Because mankind to Satan was,
for sin in bond and thrall:
He came and offered up himself,
to death to save us all.
And suffering most grievous pain,
then Pilate being judge:
Was crucified on the cross,
and thereat did not grutch.
And so he dyed in the flesh,
but quickened in the spirit:
His body then was buried,
as is our use and right.
His spirit did after this descend,
into the lower parts:
To them that long in darcknes were,
the true light of their hearts.
And in the third day of his death,
he rose to life again:
To thend he might be glorified,
out of all grief and pain.
Ascending to the heavens bye,
to sit in glory still:
On Gods right hand his father dear,
according to his will.
Until the day of judgment come,
when he shall come again
With Angels power, yet of that day,
we all be uncertain.
To judge all people righteously,
whom he has dearly bought:
The living and the dead also,
which he has made of naught.
And in the holy spirit of God,
my faith to satisfy:
The third person (...) Trinity,
believe I sted fastly*
The holy and Catholic Church,
that Gods word does (...)*
And holy Scripture does allow,
which Satan does disdain.
And also I do trust to have,
by Jesus Christ his death
Release and pardon for my sins,
and that only by faith.
What time all flesh shall rise again,
before the Lord of might:
And see him with their bodily eyes,
which now do give them light.
And then shall Christ our Savior,
the sheep and Goats deuides
And give life everlastingly,
to those whom be has tried.
Which is his realm celestial,
in glory for to rest:
With all the holy company,
of Saints and Angels blessed.
Which serve the Lord omnipotent,
obediently each hour:
To whom be all dominion,
and praise for evermore.
A prayer to the holy Ghost to be song before the Sermon.
Sing this as the Cxix. Psalm.
COme holy spirit the God of might,
comforter of us all:
Teach us to know thy word aright,
that we do never fall.
O holy Ghost, visit our coast,
defend us with thy shied:
Against all sin and wickedness,
Lord help us win the field.
Lord keep our Queen and her Counsel,
and give them will and might:
To persevere in the Gospel,
which can put sin to flight.
O Lord that geuest thy holy word,
send preachers plenteously:
That in the same we may accord,
and therein live and dye.
O holy spirit direct a right,
the preachers of thy word:
That thou by them may cut down sin,
as it were with a sword.
Depart not from those Pastors pure,
but aid them at all need:
Which break to us the bread of life,
whereon our souls do feed.
O blessed sprite of truth keep us,
in peace and unity:
Keep us from sects and errors all,
and from all Papistrie.
Convert all those that are our foes,
and bring them to thy light:
That they and we may well agree,
and praise thee day and night.
O Lord increase our faith in us,
and love for to abound^
That man and wife be void of strife,
and neighbors about us round.
In our time give thy peace, O Lord,
to nations far and nigh:
And touch them all thy holy word,
that we may sing to thee.
All (...) the Ternitie,
that is of might (...) most:
(...) and the Son,
and eke the holy Ghost.
As it has been In all the time,
that has been here to lore.
As it is now, and so shall be,
hence forth for evermore.
Da Pacem Domine. G.
^ Give peace in these our days O Lord great ^ dangers are now at hand, thine
enemies with one ^ accord, Christ's name is every land, seek to de- ^ face,
root out and race, Thy true right worship ^ in deed. Be thou the stay, Lord
we thee pray thou ^ helpest alone in all need.

Give us that peace, which we do lack,
Through misbelie sand ill life:
Thy word to offer thou do not slack,
Which we unkindly gainstriue.
With fire and sword,
This healthful word.
Some persecute and oppress:
Some with the (...),
Coufesse the truth,
Without sincere godliness.
Give peace and us thy spirit down send,
With grief and repe^ts once true:
Do pearce our hearts, our lives to amend,
And by faith in Christ renew.
That fear and dread,
War and bloustshed,
Through thy sweet mercy and grace:
May from us slide,
Thy truth abide,
And shine in every place.
The Lamentation.
^ O Lord in thee is all my trust, give ear ^ unto ^y woeful cry: Refuse me
not that am un- ^ just, but bowing down thy heavenly eye, Behold ^ how I do
still lament my sins wherein I do of- ^ fend: O Lord for them shall I be
sheat: Since thee ^ to please I do intend.

No, no not so thy will is bent,
to deal with sinners in thine ire:
But when in heart they shall repent,
thou grauntest with speed their just desir^,
To the^ therefore still shall I cry,
to wash away my sinful crime:
Thy blood (O Lord) is not yet dry,
but that it may help in time.
East thee O Lord, have thee I say,
to pour on me the gifts of grace:
That when this life must filt away,
in heaven with thee I may have place,
Where thou do reign eternally,
with God which once did down thee send,
Where Aungel^ sing continually,
to thee be praise world without end.
A thank of geuyng after the receauyng of the Lords Supper.
Sing this as the Cxxxvij. Psalm.
THe Lord be thanked for his gifts,
and mercies evermore:
That he does show unto his Saints,
to him be laud therefore.
Our toung^^ can not so praise the Lord,
as he does right des^rne*
Our hearts can not of him so think,
as he does us preserve.
His benefits they be so great,
to us that be but sin:
That at our hands for recompenc^,
there is no hope to win.
O sinful flesh that thou should have,
such mercies of the Lord:
Thou do des^rue more worthily,
of him to be abbo^d.
Naught else but sin and wretch does,
does rest within our hearts:
And stubburnly against the Lord,
we daily play our parts.
The Son above in firmament,
that is to us a light:
Does show it self more clear and pure
then we be in his sight.
The heavens above, and all therein,
more holy are then we:
They serve the Lord in their estate,
each one in his degree.
They do not strive for master shy^^
nor ^lacke their offic^ let:
But fear the Lord and do his will,
hate is to them no let.
Also the earth and all therein,
of God it is in awe:
It does observe the formers will,
by skillful natures law.
The Sea and all that therein is,
does bend when God does beck^:
The sprites beneath do tremble all,
and fear his wrathful che^ke.
But we alas for whom all these,
were made them for to rule:
Do not so know or love the Lord,
as does the Ox or Mule,
A law he gave for us to know,
what was his holy will:
He would us good but we will not
avoid the thing is ill.
Not one of us that seeks out,
the Lord of life to please:
Nor do the thing that might us join
to Christ and quiet ease.
Thus we are all his enemies,
we can it do not deny:
And he again of his good will,
would not that we should dye.
Therefore when remedy was none,
to bring us unto life:
The son of God, our flesh he took,
to end our mortal strife.
And all the law of God the Lord,
he did it full obey:
And for our sins upon the cross,
his blood our dets did pay.
And that we should not yet forget,
what good he to us wrought:
A ^igne be left our eyes to tell,
that he our bodies bought.
In bread and wine here visible,
unto thine eyes and taste:
His mercies great thou may record,
if that his spirit thou have.
As once the corn did live and grow,
and was cut down with fithe.
And threshed out with many stripes,
out of his buskes to drive.
And as the myll with violence,
did tear it ou^ so small:
And made it like to earthly dust,
not sparing it at all.
And as the oven with fire hot,
did close it up in heat:
And all this done, that I have said
that it should be our meat.
So was the Lord in his ripe age,
cut down with cruel death:
His soul he gave in torments great,
and yielded up his breath.
Because that he to us might be,
an everlasting bread:
With much reproach and trouble great,
on earth his life he led.
And as the grapes in pleasant time,
are pressed very sore:
And (...),
nor let to grow no m^^.
Because the iuyse that in them (...),
as comfortable drink:
We might receive, and joyful be,
when sorrows makes us shrink^,
So Christ's blood out pressed was,
with nails and eke with spear:
The i^yce whereof does save all those,
that rightly do him fear.
And as the corns by unity,
into one loaf is knit:
So is the Lord and his whole Church,
though he in heaven fit.
As many grapes make but one wine,
so should we be but one:
In faith and love, in Christ above,
and unto Christ alone.
Leadyng a life without all strife,
in quiet rest and peace:
From envy and from malice both,
our hearts and tounges to cease.
Which if we do, then shall we show
that we his chosen be:
By faith in him to lead a life,
as always willed be.
And that we may so do in dead,
God send us all his grace:
Th^^ after death we shall be sure,
with him to have a place.
R. W.
^ PR^serue us Lord by thy dear word. From ^ Turk and Pope defend us Lord.
Which both would ^ thrust out of his throne: Our Lord Jesus Christ ^ thy dear
son.

Lord Jesus Christ show forth thy might,
That thou art Lord of Lords by right:
Thy poor assisted stock defend,
That they may praise thee without end.
God holy Ghost our comfortou^,
Be our patron help and succor:
Give us one myn^e and perfect peace,
All gifts of grace in us increase.
Thou living God i^ persons three,
Thy name be praised in unity:
In all our need so us defend,
That we may praise thee world without end.

Morning Prayer.
ALmighty God and most merciful Father (...) do not present our selves here
before thy Majesty, trustyng in our own merits or worthynes, but to thy
manifold mercies which have promised to hear our Prayers and grant our
requests, which we shall make to thee in the name of thy beloved son Jesus
Christ our Lord: who has also commanded us to assemble our selves together in
his name with full assurance that he will not only be amongst y^ but also be
our Mediator and advocate toward thy Majesty, that we may obtay ^e all
things which shall seem expedient to thy blessed will, for our (...) Therefore
we beseech thee most merciful Father to turn thy loving countenance toward
us, and (...) not unto us our manifold sins and ofences, whereby we ^ustly
deserve thy wrath and sharp punishment but rather recea^e us to thy mercy for
I^su^ Christ's sake, accepting his death and passion as a just recompense for
all our offenses, in whom ^^ely thou art pleased, and through whom thou can
not be offended with us. And seeing of thy great mercies, we have quietly
passed this ^ight, grau^^^ heavenly father that we nay bestow this day wholly in
thy seru^^, so that all our thoughts, words, and deeds may redound to the
glory of thy name and good e^sample to all men, who seeing our good worker, may
glorify thee our heavenly father. And for as much as of (...) mere favor and
love, thou have not only created us to thine own similitude and (...), but
(...) have chosen us to be heirs with thy dear son Jesus Christ of that
immortal kingdom, which thou preparedst for us before the beginning of the
world, we beseech thee to increase our faith and knowledge: and to lighten our
ha^^e^ with thy also spirit; that we may in the mean time live in Godly
conversation; and integrity of life: knowing that Idolaters, Adulterers,
Covetous men, (...) our persons, Dronkerdes, Gl^^^^ (...), and (...) shall not
inherit the kingdom of God. And because thou have commanded us to pray one
for an other, we do^ not only make request (O Lord) for our selves, and for
them that thou have already called to the true understanding of thy heavenly
will, but for all people and nations of the world, (...) as they know by thy
wonderful worke^ that thou (...) God, over all, so they may be instructed by
thy holy spirit, to (...) in thee their only (...) and (...). But for as much
as they cannot be (...) hear, nor can hear but by preaching, and none can
preach except they be sent: Therefore (O Lord) raise up faithful dist^ibuters
of thy misterie^, who setting apar^ all worldly respects, may both in their
lyle and doctrine, only seek thy glory. Co^tr^ry^y confound Satan,
Antichrist, with all hirelinges whom thou have already cast of into a reprobate
sence^ that they may not by sects scismes, heresies, and errors, disquiet thy
little flock.

And because (O Lord) we be fallen into the latter days and dangerous times,
wherein ignorance has gotten the upper hand, and Satan by his Ministers seek
by all means to quench the light of thy Gospel: we beseech thee to maintain
thy cause against those ravening Wolves, and strengthen all thy servants,
whom they keep in prison and bondage. Let not thy long sufferyng be an
occasion, either to increase their tyranny, or to discourage thy children,
neither yet let our sins and wickedness be a hinderannce to thy mercies, but
with speeile (O Lord) consider these great miseryes. For thy people Israel
many times by their sins provoked thine anger and thou punishedst them by thy
just judgment yet though their sins were never so grievous, if they once
returned from their iniquity, thou receiuedst them to mercy:

We therefore most wretched sinners bewail, our manifold sins, and earnestly
repent us for our former wickedness and ungodly behavior toward thee:
whereas we cannot of our selves purchase thy pardon, yet we humbly beseech
thee, for Jesus Christ's sake, to show thy mercies upon us, and receive us
again to thy favor Grant us, dear Father, these our requeste^ and all other
things necessary for us and thy whole Church according to thy promise in Jesus
Christ our Lord. In whos^ name we beseech thee, as he has taught us saying:
Our father etc.

Evening prayer.
O Lord God Father everlasting, and full of pit^e, we acknowledge and confess,
that we be not worthy to lift up our eyes to heaven, much less to p^esent
ourselves before thy Majesty, with confid^nce that thou will hear our prayers
and grant our request if we consider our own deservings: for our consciences
do accuse us, and our sins witness against us, and we know that thou art an
upright judge, which do not i^stifie the sinners and wicked men: but
punishest the faults of all such as transgress thy comma^ndementes. Yet most
merciful Father, since it has pleased th^e to command us to call on thee in
all our troubles and adversities, promising even then to help us, when we
feel our selves as it were swallowed up of death and desperation, we utterly
renounc^ all worldly confidence, and flee to thy soue^aigne bounty, as our
only stay and refuge: beseeching thee, not to call to remembrance our
manifold sin and wickedness, whereby we continually provoke thy wrath and
indignation against us, neither our negl^gence and unkindness which have
neither worthily esteemed, not in our lives sufficiently expressed the sweet^
comfort of thy Gospel, reveled unto us that rather, to accept the obedience
and death of thy son Jesus Christ, who by offering up his body in sacrifice
once for all, has made a sufficient recompense for all our sins. Have mercy
therefore upon us (O Lord) and fo^geue us our offenses. Teach us by thy holy
sprite, that we may rightly wey them, and earnestly repent for the same. And so
much the rather (O Lord) because that the reproba^e and such as thou have
forsaken, can not praise thee, nor call upon thy name but the repentyng heart,
the sorrowful mind, the conscience oppressed ^^ungryng and thirstyng for thy
grace, shall ever set forth thy praise and glory. And albeit we he but worthes
and dust: yet thou art our creator, and we be the work of thy hands: yea thou
art our Father, and we thy children, thou art our shepherd, and we thy ^ocke,
thou art our redeeme^ and we the people whom thou have bought thou ^art our
God, and we thine inheritannce. Correct us no^ therefore in thine anger (O Lord)
neither according to our deserts punish us ^ut mercyfully chastise us with a
fatherly affection, than all the world may know that at what time soever a
sinner does repent him of his sin, from the bottom of his heart, thou will
put away his wickedness out of thy remembrance, as thou have promised by thy
holy Prophet.

Finally for as much as it has pleased thee to make the night for man to rest
in (as thou have ordained him the day to travel, grant (O dear^ Father) that
we may so take our bodily rest, that our souls may continually watch, for the
time that our Lord Jesus Christ shall appear for our deliverance out of this
mortal life and in the mean season that we (not ouercomen by any fantasies,
dreams, or other temptations) may fully set our minds upon thee, love thee,
fear thee, and rest in thee: furthermore that our sleep be not excessive or
overmuch after the insatiable desires of our flesh: but only sufficient to
content our weak nature, that we may be better disposed to live in all Godly
conversation to the gl^ry of thy holy name, and profit of our brethren. S^ be
it.

A Godly prayer to be said at all times.
HOnor and praise be genen to thee (O Lord God almighty) most dear Father of
heaven, for all thy mercies and loving kindness showed unto us, in that it
has pleased thy gracious goodness freely, and of thine own accord to elect and
chose us to salvation before the beginning of the world, and even like
continual thanks be given to thee for creating us after thine own Image, for
redeemyng us with the precious blood of thy dear son, when we were utterly
lost, for sanctif^ing us with thy holy sprit in the revelation and knowledge of
thy word for helping and succouryng us in all our needs and necessities, for
saving us from all dangers of body and soul, for comfortyng us so fatherly in
all our tribulations and persecutions for sparyng us so long and giving us so
large a time of repentance. These benefits (O most merciful Father) like as
we knowledge to have r^ceiued them of thy only goodness, even so we beseech
thee, for thy dear son Jesus Christ's sake, to grant us always thy holy
sprite, whereby we may continually grow in thankefulnes toward thee, to be
led into all truth, and comforted in all our adversities. O Lord, strengthen
our faith, kindle it more in (...) and love toward thee and our neighbors
for thy sake. Suffer us not most dear Father, to receive thy word any more in
vain: but grant us always the assistance of thy grace and holy spirit, that
in heart, word and deed we may sanctify and do worship to thy name. Help to
amplify and increase thy kingdom, and what soever thou sendest, we may be
heartily well content with thy good pleasure and will: Let us not lack the
thing (O Father) without the which we can not serve thee, but bless thou so
all the works of our hands that we may have sufficient, and not to be
chargeable, but rather helpefull unto others be mercy full (O Lord) to our
offenses, and seeing our det is great, which thou have forgeuen us in Jesus
Christ, make us to love thee and our neighbors so much the more. Be thou our
Father our Captain and defender, in all temptations, hold thou us by thy
merciful hand, that we may be eliuered from all inconuenienees, and end our
lives in the sanctifing and honor of thy, holy name, through Jesus Christ our
Lord, and only (...)

Let thy mighty hand and out (...) Lord) he still out defense, thy mercy and
(...) kind nesse in Jesus Christ thy dear son our salvation: thy true and
holy word our instruction: thy grace and holy spirit our comfort and
consolation, unto the end and in the end. So be it.

O Lord increase our faith.
A confession of all estates at all times.
O Eternal God and most merciful Father, we confess, and acknowledge, here
before thy divine mai^stie, that we are miserable sinners, conceived and borne
in sin and iniquity, so that in us there is no goodness. For the flesh
evermore rebelleth against the spirit, whereby we continually transgress thy
holy Precepts, and commandments, and so purchase to our selves through
(...) just judgment, death and damnation. Notwithstanding (O heavenly Father)
for as much a^ we are displeased with our selves for the sins that we have
committed against thee, and do unfeignedly repent us of the same: we most humbly
beseech thee for Jesus Christ's sake, to show thy mercy on us to forgive us all
our sins, and to increase thy holy spirit in us: that we acknowledgyng from
the bottom of our hearts, our own righteousness, may from hence forth not
only mortify our sinful lusts and affections, but also bring forth such
fruits: as may be agreeable to thy most blessed will, not for the worthynesse
thereof, but for the merits of thy dearly beloved son Jesus Christ our
only Savior whom thou have already given an oblation, and offering for our
sins and for whose sake we are certainly persuaded, that thou will deny us
nothing, that we shall ask in his name according to thy will. For thy spirit
does assure our consciences that thou art our merciful Father, (...) so lowest
us thy children through him, that nothing is (...) thy heavenly grace and
favor from us: to thee therefore (O Father) with the son and the holy Ghost
be all honor and glory, world without end. So be it.

A prayer to be said before a man begin his work.
O Lord God most merciful Father and Savior seeing it has pleased thee to
command us to travel that we may relieve our need, we beseech thee of thy
grace so to bless our labor that thy blessing may extend unto us, without the
which we are not able to continue, and that this great favor may be a witness
unto us of thy bonntyfulnesse and assistaunce, so that thereby we may know the
fatherly care that thou have over us. Moreuer (O Lord) we beseech th^e that
thou would strengthen us with thine holy spirit: that we may faithfully
travel in our estate and vocation without fraud, or deceit, and that we may
endeavor our selves to follow thine holy ordinance, rather then to seek to
satisfy our greedy affections or desire to gain. And if it please the^ (O
Lord) to prosper our labor give us a mind also to help them that have need,
according to that ability that thou of thy mercy shall give us, and knowing
that all good things come of thee, grant that we may humble our selves to our
neighbors, and not by any means lift our sel^^^ up above them which have not
received so large a portion as of thy mercy thou have given us. And if it
please thee to try and exercise us by greater poverty and need the our flesh
would desire: that thou would yet O Lord grau^ us grace to know that thou will nourish us continually through thy bountiful liberality, that we be not
so tempted that we fall into distrust, but that we may patiently way^ till
(...) ^on to rest upon thy mercie^. Hear us O Lord of (...) through Jesus
Christ thy sonn^ our Lord, Amen.

A Prayer for the whole state of Christ's Church.
ALmighty God and most merciful father, we humbly submit our selves, and fall
down before thy majesty, beseeching thee from the bottom of our hearts, that
this seed of thy word now sown amongst us, may take such deep root, that
neither the burning heat of persecution cause it to wyther, neither the thorny
cares of this life choke it, but that as seed sown in good ground, ^t may
bring forth thirty, sixty, and an hundredth fold, as thy heavenly wisdom has
appointed. And because we have need continually to crave many things at thy
bands, we humbly beseech thee (O heavenly Father) to grant us thy holy
spirit, to direct our petitions that they may proceed from such a fervent
mind as may be agreeable to thy most blessed will. And seeing that our infirmity
is able to do nothing without thy help, and that thou art not ignorant with
how many and great temptations we poor wretches are on every side enclosed and
compassed: let thy strength O Lord sustain our weakness, that we being
defended with the fo^ce of thy grace, may be safely preserved against all
assaults of Satan, who goes about continually like a roaryng Lion seeky^g to
denoure us. Increase our faith, O merciful Father, that we do not swerue at
any time from thy heavenly word, but augment in us hope, and love, with a
careful keeping of all thy commandments, that no hardness of heart, no
hypocrisy, no concupiscence of the eyes, nor inticementes of the world, do
draw us away from thy obedience. And seeing we live now in these most perilous
times, let thy fatherly providence defend us against the violence of our
enemies, which do seek by all means to oppress thy truth.

Furthermore for as much as by thy holy Apostle we be taught to make our prayers
and supplications for all men, we pray not only for our selves here present,
but beseech thee also to reduce all such as be yet ignorant, how the miserable
captivity of blyndnes and error, to the pure understanding and knowledge of
thy heavenly truth that we all with one consent and unity of mind may worship
thee our only God and Savior. And that all Pastors, Shepheardes, Ministers to
whom thou have committed the dispe^sation of thy holy word, and charge of thy
chosen people, may both in their life and doctrine be found laithfull, setting
before their eyes thy glory, and that by them all poor sheep which wander and
go astray, may be gathered and brought home to thy fold.

Moreover, because the hearts of rulers are in thy hands, we beseech thee to
direct, and govern the hearts of all Kings, Princes, and Magistrates, to whom
thou have committed the sword: especially (O Lord) according to our bounden
duty we beseech thee to maintain and increase the honorable estate of the
Queens Majesty and all her most noble Counselors, and Magistrates, and all
the whole body of this common weal. Let thy Fatherly favor so preserve them,
and thy holy spirit so govern their hearts, that they may in such so^t
exercise their office, that thy Religion may be purely maintained, manners
reformed, and sin punished, according to the precise rule of thy holy word.
And for that we be all members of the mystical body of Jesus Christ, we make
our requests unto thee (O heavenly Father) for all such as are afflicted with
any kind of cr^sse, or tribul^tion, as war, plague, famine, sickness,
poverty, imprisonment, persecution, banishment, or any other kind of thy
rods, whether it be of calami^le of body, or vexation of mind, that it would
please thee to ge^e them patience, and constancy, till thou send them full
deliuerau^ce of all their troubles, root out from hence (O Lord) all ra^enyng
Wolves, which to fill their bellies, seek to destroy thy flock. And show thy
great mercies upon those our brethren in other countries, which are persecuted,
cast into prison, and daily condemned to death, for the testimony of thy truth.
And though they be utterly destitute of all man's aid, yet let thy sweet
comfort never depart from them, but so inflame their hearts with thy holy
spirit, that they may boldly and chearefully abide such trial as thy Godly
wisdom shall appoint. So that at length as well by their death, as by their
life, the kingdom of thy dear soon Jesus Christ, may increase and shine
through all the world. In whose name we make our humble petitions unto thee as
he has taught us, saying.

Our Father which art in heaven. etc.

An other prayer of the same made by I. Fox.
LOrd Jesus Christ, son of the living God, who was crucified for our sins
and did rise again for our Justification, and ascendyng up to heaven,
reignest now at the right hand of thy Father, with full power and authority
rulyng and disposing all things according to thine own gracious and glorious
purpose: we sinful creatures, and yet servants, and members of thy Church,
do prostrate our felues and our prayers before thy Imperial Majesty, having
no other (...) nor advocate to speed our suits, or to resort unto but thee
alone, beseechyng thy goodness to be good to thy poor Church militant here in
this wretched earth, sometimes a rich Church, a large Church, an universally
Church, spread sarre and wide through the whole compass of the earth, now
driven into anarrow corner of the world, and has much need of thy gracious
help. First the Turk with his sword, what lands, nations, and countries,
what Empires, King domes, and Provinces with Cities innumerable has he won,
not from us, but from thee? Where thy name was wont to be inuocated, thy word
preached, thy Sacraments administered, there now reigns barbaron; Mahumet,
with his filthy Alcoran. The florishyng Churches in Asia, the learned Churches
of Grecia, the manifold Churches in Africa which were wont to serve thee, now
are gone from thee. The seven Churches of Asia, with their candlestickes (whom
thou did so well forewarne) are now removed. All the Churches where thy
diligent Apostle S. Paul, thy Apostle Peter, and John, and other Apostles so
laboriously travailed, preaching and writing to plant thy Gospel, are now gone
from thy Gospel. In all the kingdom of Syria, Palestina, Arabia, Persia, in
all Armenia, and the Empire of Capadoc^, through the whole compass of (...),
with Egypt, and with Africa also (unless amongst the ^arre Ethiopians some
old steps of Christianity pera^^^enture yet do remain) either else in all
Asia and Africa, thy Church has not one foot of free land, but all is turned
either to infidelity, or to captivity, what soever pertains to thee. And if
Asia and Africa only were decayed, the decay were great, but yet the defection
were not so vniuer^all. Now in Europa a great part also is shronke from thy
Church. All Thracia with the Empire of Constantinople, all Grecia, Epyru^,
Illyricum, and now of la^^ all the kingdom almost of Hu^garia, with much of
Austria, with lamentable slaughter of Christen blood is wasted and all become
Turks:

Only a little angle of the Weast parts yet remains (...) of thy name. But
here, (...) comes an other mischief as great, or greater then (...) other.
For the ^urke with his sword is not so cruel, but the Bishop of Rome on the
other side is more fierce and bitter against us, styrryng up his Bishops to
burn us, his confederates to conspire our destruction, setting Kings against
their subjects, and subjects (...) to rebel against their Princes, and all
for thy na^ (...) Such dissension and hostility Satan has set among it us,
that Turks be not more enemies to Christians, then Christians to Christians,
Papists to Protestants: yea Protesta^tes with Protestants do not agree, but
fall out for trifles. So that the poor little flock of thy Church distressed
on every side, has neither rest without, nor peace within, not place almost in
the world, where to abide, but may cry now from the earth, even as thine own
reverence cried once from thy Cross: My God, My God, why have thou forsaken me?

Amongst us English men here in England, after so great storms of
persecution, and cruel murder of so many Martyrs, it has pleased thy grace
to gene us these Al^toa days, which yet we enjoy, and beseech thy merciful
goodness still they may continue. But here also, alack, what should we say?
So many enemies we have that e^^ie us this rest and trauquillitie, and do what
they can to disturb it. They which be friends and lovers of the Bishop of
Rome, although they eat the fat of the land, and have the best prefermentes
and offices, and live most at ease, and ayle nothing: yet are they not
therewith content. They grudge, they mutter and murmr, they conspire and take
on against us. It fretteth them that we live by them or with them, and can not
abide that we should draw the bare breathyng of the air, when they have all
the most liberty of the land, And albeit thy singular goodness has given them
a Queen so calm, so pacie^^, so merciful, more like a natural mother then a
Princes, to govern over them, such ^s neither they nor their a^nciters ever
read of in the stories of this land before: yet all this will not calm them:
their unquiet spi^ite is not ye^ (...): they repine and rebel, and needs
would have, with the Frogs of E^ope, a Ciconia, au Italian stranger, the
Bishop of Rome, to play Rex over them, and ca^e not if all the world were set
on fire so they with their Italian Lord might reign alone. So fond are we
English men of strange and foreign things: so unnatural to our selves: so
greedy of new fangle novelties, never contented wit^ any state long to
continue, be it never so good: and furthermore so cruel one to an other, that
we think our life not quiet unless it be seasoned with the blood of other.
For that is their hope, that is all their gapyng and lookyng, that is their
golden day, their day of Iubiley, which they thyrst for so much: not to have the
Lord to come in the clouds, but to have our blood, and to spill our lives.

That that is it which they would have, and long since would have had their
wills upon us, had not thy gracious pity and mercy raised up to us this our
merciful Queen, thy servant ELIZABETH, somewhat to stay their fury. For
whom as we most condig^ely give thee most hearty thanks, so likewise we
beseech thy heavenly Majesty, that as thou have given her unto us, and have
from so manifold dangers preserved her before she was Queen: so now in her
Royal estate, she may continually be preserved, not only from their hands,
but from all malignant devises wrought, attempted, or conceived of enemies,
both ghostly and bodily against her. In this her government be her gouerner we
beseeth thee: So shall her Majesty well govern us, if first she be governed
by thee. Multiply her reign with many days, and her years, with much
fel^citie, with abundance of peace, and life ghostly. That as she has now
doubled the years of her sister, and brother so (if it be thy pleasure) she
may over (...).

And because no government can long (...) without good Counsel: neither can
any Counsel be good except it be prospered by thee, bless therefore we
beseech thee, both her Majesty and her honorable Counsel, that both they
rightly may understand what is to be done, and she accordyngly may accomplish
that they do Counsel, to thy glory, and furtheraunce of thy Gospel, and
public wealth of this Realm.

Furthermore, we beseech thee, Lord Jesus (who with the Majesty of thy
generation, do drown all Nobility, being the only son of God, heir and
Lord of all things) bless the Nobility of this Realm, and of other Christen
Realms, so as they Christianly agreeing among them selves, may submit their
Nobility to serve thee, or else let them feel (O Lord) what a frivolous thing
is that Nobility which is without the^.

Likewise to all Magistrates such as be advanced to authority, or placed in
office, by what name or title soever give we beseech thee, a careful
conscience, uprightly to discharge their duty, that as they by public
persons to serve the common wealth, so they abuse not their office to their
private gain, nor private revenge of their own affections, but that justice
being administered without bribery, and equity balanced without cruelty or
partiality, things that be amiss may be reformed, vice abandoned, truth
supported, innocence relieved, Gods glory maintained, and the common wealth
truly served.

But especially to thy spiritual Ministers, Bishops, and Pastors of thy
Church, grant we beseech thee (O Lord Prince of all pasto^^) that they
following the steps of thee, of thy Apostles, and holy Martyrs, may seek
those things which be not their (...), but only which be thine: not caryng
how many benefices, nor what great Byshopprikes they have, (...) well they can
guide, those they have. Give them such ^eale of thy Church, as may devour
them, and grant them such salt, wherewith the whole people may be seasoned,
and which may never be unsavory, but quicken daily by thy holy spirit, whereby
thy flock by them may be preserved.

In general give to all the people* and the whole state of this Realm such
brotherly (...) in knowledge of thy truth, and such obedience their Superiors,
as they neither provoke the scourge of God (...) them, nor their Princes sword
to be (...) against her will, out of the scaberd of long sufferennce, where it
has been long hyd. Especially give thy Gospel long continaunce amongst us.
And if (...) the contrary grant we beseech thee, with an earnest repentance
of that which is past, to join ^ ^arty purpose of amendment to come.

And forasmuch as the Bishop of Rome is wont on every Good friday to accurse v^
as damned her (...) we here curse not him, but pray for him, that he with all
his partakers either may be turned to a better truth, or else, we pray thee
(gracious Lord) that we never agree with him in doctrine, and that he may so
(...) us still, and never bless us more as he blessed us in Queen Maryes
time. God of his mercy keep away that blessing from us.

Finally, in stead of the Popes Blessing, give us thy blessing Lord we besee^^
thee, and conser^e the peace of thy Church, and course of thy blessed Gospel.
Help^ them-that be needy, and afflicted. Comfort them that labor and be heavy
laden. And above all things continue and increase our faith. And for as much as
thy poor little flock can fearse have any place or rest in this world, come
Lord we beseech thee with thy Factum est, and make an end, that this world may
have no more time nor place here, and that thy Church may have rest for ever.
Our Father which art in heaven. etc.

A Prayer, against the devil and his manifold temptations made by S. Augustine.
THere wanted a tempter, and thou wa^^ the cause that he was wantyng: there
wanted time and place, and thou (...) the cause that they wanted. The tempter
was present, and there wanted neither place nor time: but thou beldst me back
that I should not consent. The tempter came full of darkness as he is: and
thou did harten me that I might despise him. The tempter came armed and
strongly: but to the intent he should not overcome me, thou did dest restrain
him and strengthen me. The tempter came transformed into an angel of light:
and to the intent he should not deceive me, thou did rebuke him: and to the
intent I should know him, tho^ did inlighten me. For he is that great red
dragon the old Se^pent, called the Devil, and Satan, which has seven heads
and ten bornes, whom thou have created to take his pleasure in this ho^g^ and
broad sea, wherein there creep living wightes innumerable, and beasts great
and small, that is to say diverse sorts of feendes, which practice nothing else
day (...) night, but to go about seeking who^ they may devour, except thou
rescue him O Lord Jesus. For it is, that old dragon which was bread in the
paradise of pleasure, which draws down the third part of the Stars of
heaven with his tail, and castes them to the ground, which with his ve^^
poysoneth the waters of the earth that as many me^ as drink of them may dye,
which trampleth upon gold as if it were mire, and (...) of opinion that Jordan
shall shall run into his mouth, and which is made of such a mould as he
fears no man.

And who shall save us from his chappes O Lord Jesus? Who shall pluck us out
of his mouth saving thou O Lord, who have broken the heads of the great
Dragon? Help us Lord. Spread out thy wings over us O Lord, that we may flee
under them from the face of this Dragon that pursues us: and fence thou us
from his horns, with thy shield. For this is his continual endeavor, this is
his only desire to devour the souls which thou have created.

And therefore we cry unto thee our God, deliver us from our daily adversary,
who whether we sleep or wake, whether we eat or drink, or whether we be
doing of any thing else, presses upon us by all kind of means, assaultyng us
day and night with traynes and policies, and shooting his venomous arrows at
us, sometime openly* and sometime privily to sles our souls.

And yet such is our great madness O Lord, in that whereas we see the Dragon
continually in a readynes to devout us with open mouth: we nevertheless do
sleep and riot in our own slouthfulnes, as though we were out of his danger,
who desiteth nothing else but to de^rey us. Our mischievous enemy* to the intent
to kill us, watches continually, and never sleeps, and yet will not we wake
from sleep, to save our selves. (...) he has pitched infinite (...) our
seek, and ^^lled all our ways with (...), to catch oursoules. And who can
escape (...) so many and so great dangers? He has Jesus for us in our riches,
in our poverty, in ou^ (...), in our pleasures, in our sleep, and in (...)
set snares for us in our word (...) all our life. But thou O Love, (...) of the
soulers, and (...) give praise to (...) Lord, who has (...) pray for their
teeth: (...) as sparrow (...) net, the net (...) and we (...).
