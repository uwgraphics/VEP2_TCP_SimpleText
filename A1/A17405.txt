Observations to be used in letting of blood, purging, bathing, and Sweating.
etc.
Of Blood letting.
LEt not Blood at any time without just cause, for it brings weakness, and
many infirmities: and when it is to be done, let (...) be with due
considerations, and the advice of some learned Physician, so that it may be
done (if necessity enforce not the contrary) after good digestion, and
fasting, in a fair temperate day^ and beware of all manner of excess, as
laboring, watchyng, carnal copulation. etc.

And these Signs generally are good to let Blood in, namely, Aries, Libra,
Sagittarius, and Pisces.

Perticulerly, for chollericke persons, when the Moon is in Cancer, Scorpius,
and Pisces.

For the flemmaticke in Aries and Sagittarius (...) ^^es: and it is best
comforted, when the Moon ^s in Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius.

The second is the virtue digestive, so named, because it digesteth or alters
the noryshment into a due form. If it be too weak to do the ^ffice, it is
best strengthened when the Moon ^s in Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius.

The third is the virtue retentiue, and is cal^ed so, because it keeps in the
good noryshment, ^artyll the digestive virtue has duly digested and changed
it. It is chiefly helped, the Moon ^eing in Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn.

The fourth is called the virtue expulsive, because his office is to expel and
put out those superfluous excrementes which remain when ^he other virtues
have done their offices duly. It is best relieved the Moon being in Can^er,
Scorpius, and Pisces.

The virtue Attractiue is governed of ye Sun. The virtue Digestive is
governed of Jupiter. The virtue Retentiue is governed of Saturn. The virtue
Expulsive is governed of ye Moon.

Of the Eclipses of this yeer^ of our Lord. 1591.
AS touching the Eclipses in this yeer^ which are three in number: that is to
sa^ one of the Sun happening the.x. day (...) July, at two of the clock
and.xxvi. min. in the after noone, being darkened but one poyn^ which is a very
small thing, and of no gre^^ signification.

And the second (which is the first of the Moon) is the.xxvi. day of July,
at.iiii. of t^^ clock in the after noone also, and under o^^ Horizon, being
yet darkened.xvii. points a^^ a half. etc.

And the third, which is the second of t^^ Moon, is the.xx. day of December
at three (...) the clock, and.xx. min. in the morning, in t^^ sign. Cancer,
and will be darkened.xix. poyn^^^ and more in the.viii. house of the Heavens.

Of these I say, in respect that one sh^^ not be seen of us at all, and
another very lyt^^ and the third, though it shall be manifes^^^ seen, yet the
effects thereof shall not take pla^^^ (...) declares and showed in the
particular judgments of the days of the months, containing this first
quarter. etc.

The distemperance of this quarter is like to breed^ ^any sicknesses, and
sundry diseases, as well i^^^^ng folks, as in old, as namely Agues of all fates,
Stitches, grypinges, the Collicke, Surf^tes, the Megrime, and ache in the Head
and Shoulders, Plurisies, small Pockes, Wor^^es in the Maw, Horsenes, Rewine,
Catharre^, Coughes, hardness in fetching the breath the Strangurie, and such
others, paynefull to ^^ffer, and not easy to cure.

Of the Spring time.
THe Spring takes his beginning at the ^^mes entering into the first min. of
the f^^e Aries, which shall be on Thurseday the.x^ (...) of March, at.iii. of the
clock and.xvi. min. in the after noone, making the day and night to be ^^ne
length through the whole world.

The quarter of the year is naturally hot and moist temperately, and is
therefore reckoned the most ^^lsome time in the year, and it is now the b^ time
to remove sicknesses, and griefs gotten before, and also to prevent those to
come: for if the body of man do abound with humors, which are ready to
oppress nature, whether there be present sickness by the means of them, or else
danger of sickness to come: those humors are best to be emptied out of the body
now, either by lettyng of blood, purging, hathyng, sweating, or such like
euacuation, which at this time I will not prosecute.

The disposition of the weather in this quarter of the year, is like to be
very variable and inconstant: for as there are like to be many hot and dry
days, showing a great l^^clynes of continuance: so on the contrary there wylbe
often shewers tempered with the sam^ and sundry clappes of thunder and
lyghtninges, making the weather uncertain, with cloudi^^^ distempered heat,
and moystnes.

The sicknesses like to be in this (...), are Fevers of long continuance,
Fluxes of the belly, the faslyng sickness, rotten coughes, thin rewines, the
head ache, pluresies, h^tre impostumes in the breasts and sides, Stitches,
Crampes, pain in the neck and br^^^, with diverse others, both noisome and
also ^^^nous. (...) most part stormy, and very cold, with great inconstantie,
as cloudy sometime, and thycke dark weather: at other times fierce raines by
shewers, and often dryuing wyndes, with snow or fleet myrt with rain. At
other times thunder, with rai^^, and such like distempered weather.

It is to be feared that now some strange sickness (...) and unknown diseases
shall happen, and be heard of among the people, and also burning A^^^s,
inflammation of the Lunges, passions of the Heart, obstructions in the L^uer,
weakness in the Back, swellyng and hardness in the Sp^^ent, Rewines, Catharres,
watery F^ures, and such like, both dangerous and deadly.

God of his great mercy turn from us all those euylles which are intended
against us, and give us grace to amend our wicked lives, the procuring causes
of all our punishments, and let us first be careful for our souls, as for
our (...) (...) deane contrary: As first, to study for good^^^, next for
health, and last for wealth for if (...) first seek the kingdom of God, and
the ^^^^^^ousnes thereof, the other things ^^albe ^^inistred unto us. But we
see by ex^^^ence (...) at is too common, so great blindness (...) be a^ong men,
that they care in such wise for riches ^^ely, that in respect thereof, they
(...) little ^^r health of the body, and nothing at all for the ^ood estate and
prosperity of the soul, (...) cause ^ost lamentable and sorrowful.
