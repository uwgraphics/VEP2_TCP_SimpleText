Two notable Sermons, made the third and fyfte Fridayes in Lent last past,
before the Queen's highness, concerning the real presence of Christ's body and
blood in the blessed Sacrament: and also the Mass, which is the sacrifice of
the new Testament. By Thomas Watson, Doctor of Divinity.

Roma. 12. Obsecro uos fratres per misericordiam Dei, ut exhibeatis corpora
uestra hostiam uiuam, sanctam, Deo placentem. etc.


IF S. Paul writing to the Phylyppians the third chapter was not asshamed too
say, Philip. 3
To write one thing diverse times to you, is not pain or slouthe to me, but
profitable and necessary for you, much less ought Ito be asshamed for that
I propounde to you at this time that lesson again, which before I have twyce
entreated, saying I intend by Gods grace to speak nothing, but that I have
learned, either of Saint Paul him self, or of such I think was endued with
the same spirit Saint Paul was, and this I do not for lack of good matter,
but for lack of better matter in my judgment, and more necessary to be
learned of us all at this present. For what is better worthier, and more
neadefull to be taught and learned of all sorts of men in these evil days,
and corrupt time, then how to offer up our selves to God a living, holy,
and pleasinge sacrifice, to overcome and repress our naughty will and
affections, to mortify our earthly members and conversation, and so to banish
sin, that it reygne not in our mortal bodies? the largenes of which matter
is so great, and does extend it self in so many parts, causes, and
circumstancies, that although the whole matter does perteyne and has respect
to one end: yet the entreating of it being long, must needs be variouse, and
for that reason can not be tediouse to him, that loves to learn to live well,
and please almightye God.

The end of this my matter is, to destroy the kyngedome of sin, for which
purpose Gods son was incarnate, to bring which thing to pass in us, was all the life, the example, the passion, the resurrection of Christ, and all the
doctrine and Sacraments of Christ. Like as contrary to erecte and establyshe
this kingdom of sin, is all the travail and temptation of the devil, now
fawning like a serpent, transformyng him self into an angel of light, to
intrappe and seduce the simple and unware: now raging like a lion to overthrow
the feeble and fearful, and not only is it his travail, but also it is the
whole labor and practice of all his children by imitation, as Infideles,
Jews, heretics, scismatikes, false brethren, counterseyte christians, both in
living and learning labouryng night and day with all wit and will to
destroy the faith of Christ, the Sacraments of Christ the sacrifice of
Christ, as much as in them lies* which three be special means to destroy the
kingdom of sin, which they with all their power set up and maynteyne.

The practice of the devil and his ministers in this point I have partlye
touched, and by Gods grace and your patience shall now proceed further. I
have opened the decay of faith, good works, and penance, which be remedies
against sin. One other remedy there is, that lies in much decay, which
will lie still, except good men (accorcording to their bounden duties) put to
their help (...) ^andes. I mean the sacrifice of the church, the sacrifice of
ye new testament, the sacrifice of our reconciliation in the body and blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he has instituted in his last supper, and so
(as Ireneus says) Noui testamenti nouam docuit oblationem, Ireneus lib. 4.
ca. 35.
quam Ecclesia ab Apostolis accipiens in uniuerso mu^do offert Deo. Christ
confessyng the cup to be his blood, has taught the new sacrifice of the new
testament, which sacrifice the church receiving of the Apostels, does offer to
God throughoute the whole world.

There is nothing so ancient, so profitable, necessary and so wholesome, as
this sacrifice is that has been of some men, and that of late, so assaulted,
reviled, rejected, blasphemed, oppressed, persecuted, and with such reproach
and indignation banyshed and exiled, without cause or any good ground why they
should so have done, but yt they knew sin should decay, if that were used. And
therefore intending to establyshe the kingdom of sin labored with all
violence to subuerte this enemy, and remedy against sin* which (as Saint
Cypriane does say) ad totius hominis uitam salutemque proficit, Cyprianus Ser*
de caen^ Domi^^.
simul medicamen tum and holocaustum ad sanandas infirmitates and purgandas
iniquitates existens, which does profit to the life and salvation of the
whole man, being both a medicine to heal infirmities, and a sacrifice to
purge iniquities.

This little time that I have now, I intend (God willing) to bestow in this
matter to reduce into your remembrance the foundation and commoditye of this
sacrifice of the church, and to repel such boltes, as the folishnes of some,
and the malice of other have shot against it, that knowing the necessity and
goodness of it, we may follow the counsel of Saint Barnarde which said:
Bernard. hom. 3. super Mis^us est.
Discamus eius humilitatem, imitemur mansuetudinem, amplectamu^ dilectionem,
co^municemus passionibus, lauemur in sanguine eius: ipsum offeramus
propitiationem pro peccatis nostris, quo niam ad hoc ipse natus and datus est
nobis. Ipsum oculis patris, ipsum offeramus and suis, quia and pater proprio
filio suo non pepercit, sed pro nobis tradidit illum etc. Let us learn his
humilitye, let us follow his meakenes and gentleness, let us embrace his love,
let us communicate in his passions by suffryng with him, let us be washed in
his blood, let us offer him the propitiation or a sacrifice propitiatory for
our sins, for to this end was he borne, and given to us: let us offer him to
his fathers eyes: let us offer him to his own eyes: for ye father has not
spared his own son, but has given him for us, and so forth.

And also as the same Bernarde more plainly writes in an other place, Bernar.
Ser. 1. de Epiph.
saying thus. Pauperes sumus, parum dare possumus, attamen reconciliari
possumus pro paruo illo, si uolumus: totum quod dare possum; miserum corpus
istud est, illud si dedero, satis est: si quo minus, addo and corpus ipsius,
nam illud de meo est, and meum est: paruulus enim natus est nobis, and filius
datus est nobis. De te Domine suppleo, quod minus habeo in me. O dulcissima
reconciliatio. We are poor, and little can we give, yet for that little we may
be reconcyled to GOD, if we will. All that I am able to give is this wretched
body of mine if I give that, it is sufficient, if it be not, I add also
Christ's body, for that is mine and of mine: for a little one is borne to us,
and the son is given unto us. O Lord, that lacks in me, I supplye of thee.
O most sweateste reconciliation.

See how Saint Bernarde joins the offering of our bodies and of Christ's
body together, that if the oblation of our bodies be imperfecte and suffice
not, the oblation of christ's body may fulfill and supplye, that lacks in us?
And to what end? that we might be reconciled, that the body of sin might be
destroyed, that it reygne not in our bodies.

Here the Prayer was made. NOw entryng to speak of ye sacrifice of the
church, I pre suppose one thing, which is the foundation of the same, to be
most certaynlye and constantly beloved of all us, that be here present: which
is, that in the most blessed Sacrament of the aultare is present the true
body and blood of our Savior Christ, the price of our redemption, not in
figure only, but in truth and very deed, which the learned men call really
and essentially, that is to say, that thing, that substance, that was upon
the cross, is now verily present in the blessed Sacrament, before we receive
it: the cause of which real presence is the omnipotente power and will of God,
assistyng the due administration of the Priest, the which body and blood we
christen men receive by the service of our bodies and senses, though not by the
judgment of our senses, but only by the judgment of faith, because it is
given not in the outward form of the self same body and blood, as it was
slain and shed upon the cross, but in the fourmes of our daily and special
nutrimentes of bread and wine, and that for sundry weyghtye, and necessary
causes foresene by our Savior Christ.

For* seeing the substance of our sacrifice of the new Testament, is the very
real and natural body of Christ, as may be proved by many auctorities.
Saint Cypriane says: In sacrificio quod Christus est, Cyprianus. lib. 2
epist. 3.
non nisi Christus sequendus est. In that sacrifice that is Christ no man is
to be followed but Christ. Here he says, that Christ is that sacrifice that
we offer to almyghtye God. Also Saint Basyl writes in his form of Mass:
Basilius in Missa.
Tu es qui offers, and offerris, and qui suscipis, et impartis Christ Deus
noster. O Christ our God, thou art he that both do offer, and is offered,
that both give the offering and receaueth.

Saint Basyl by this means, that the sacrifice, which the church offered to
GOD, is Christ him self, who in that he is the head of his body the church,
is one offerer with ye church, and so is both offerer and offered, as Basyl
says.

Likewise Saint Ambrose writing of the invention of the bodies of two
gloriouse martyrs Geruasius and Prothasius, Ambros. lib. 10. epi 85.
and of the burying of them under the aultare, says thus: Succedant uictimae
triumphales in locum, ubi Christus hostia est, sed ille super altar qui pro
omnibus passus est, ^sti sub altari, qui illius redempti sunt passione. Let
these triumphynge sacrifices (meaning the bodies of the martyrs) go into yt
place where Christ is a sacrifice. But Christ is a sacrifyce above the
aultare, who suffered for all men, these two under ye aultare, that were redeemed
by his passion.

Of this place I note my purpose, which is, that the sacrifice of the Church
and new Testament, is the very real body and blood of our Savior Christ,
which is also testified by Chrysostom in his homelye he writes of the praise
of GOD in these words. Chrysostom* hom. de laud dei
Vereamini mensam quaue desuper uictima illa iacet Christus scilicet qui nostri
causa occisus est. fear and reverence that table, above yt which lies that
sacrifice (that is to say Christ) which for our cause was slain.

By which words Chrysostom declares his faith, that the sacrifice of ye
church is Christ, and also that christ is not only in heaven, as some men
damnably bears you in hand, but is placed lyinge above ye table of the
aultare as ye substance of our sacrifice.

And in an other homely he writes. Idem hom de Encenijs.
Mensa mysterijs instructa est, et agnus dei pro te immolatur. The table is
furnished with mysteries, and the lamb of god for the is offered: teachinge us
that the holy mysteryes wherewith the table of our aultare is furnyshed be the
body and blood of Christ (that is to say) the lamb of god, which is also
then offered for us.

Saint Augustyne is full of such saynges: August. lib. 9. Co^fess. ca. 12.
as writing of his mothers death, how that he wept nothing for her all the
time the Mass was said for her soul, which he expresses by these words.
Cum offerr^tur pro ea sacrificium praecij nostri. When the sacrifice of our
price was offered for her.

I leave out all the rest of the sentence contented to allege only this, that
proves the sacryfice, which is offered by the priest for the dead to be our
price, which is and can be nothing else, but the body and blood of Christ,
which he gave upon the cross, as the price of our redemption.

But playnest of al he writes in a book entitled. Liber Sententiarum
Prosperi. August. li. Senten. Prosp.
which book is alleged of Gratian in the decrees in these words. Hoc est
quod dicimus, quod modis omnibus approbare contendimus sacrificiu^ Ecclesiae
duobus confici, duobus constare, uisibili elementorum specie, and inuisibili
Domini nostri Jesus Christi corpore and sanguine, and Sacramento, and re
Sacramenti, id est, corpore Christi. This is that we say, that we labor to
prove by all means, that the sacrifice of the church is made and consists of
two things, of the visible form of the elements and of the invisible body
and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ both the outward Sacrament and ye thing
or substance of ye Sacrament, that is the body of Christ. These words need
no declaringe but poyntinge: and for that cause, why should I tarry in this
point any longer, seeing that our books be full of such like aucthorities?

Therefore as I began saying the substance of our Sacryfyce of the new
Testament, is the very real and natural body of Christ, if this body be
not present in the Sacrament, as the enemies of Christ's cross and the
destroyers of our faith falsely pretend: then be we christen men left all
together desolate without any sacrifyce priua^e unto us, for both the
sacrifice of Christ upon the cross, and also the inward sacrifice of man's
heart be not private but common to us and to all faithful men from the
beginning of the world to the last end.

And furthermore saying a sacrifice is an outward protestation of our inward
faith and devotion, if we christen men now have no sacrifice private unto us:
then be we the most miserable men that ever were, being without any kind of
religion. For take away our sacrifice, and take away our religion, as S.
Cyprian confutinge the carnal thoughts of the Capernaites, Cypria. Ser. de
Caena.
that thought they should have eaten Christ's flesh either roasted or sodde,
and so should have consumed it to nothing: writes thus. Cum illius personae
caro si in frusta partiretur non omni humano generi posset sufficere, qua semel
consumpta uideretur religio interisse, cui ne quaquam ulte rius uictima
superesset. Seeing that if the flesh of his person were dyuyded into pieces, it
could not suffice al mankind to eat upon, which flesh after it were once
clean wasted* and consumed, our religion might like wise seem to perish and
be destroyed, which had no more any sacrifyce remaining.

Whereupon I conclude, that if we have not Christ's body and blood present
in the Sacrament for our external sacrifice, whereby we may mitigate and please
almighty God, and obtain remission of sin and spiritual grace and gifts:
then should we be no better then the Turks, saying all nations from the
beginning of the world, both gentiles and Jews, have had one kind of outward
sacrifice, to declare and express their inward devotion and religion, either
to the true God of heaven, or to such as they fantasied or feyned to be gods,
saving only the Turks, (as Petrus Cluniacensis writes. Whereby it appears,
that this sect that denies and destroys ye Mass, which is the sacrifyce
of the Church, is verelye the sect of Mahumette, preparing a way for the
Turk to ouerrunne all Christendom, as he has done a great piece already.

For what could the Turk do more against our faith, if he did overcome us,
beside our thraldom and tyrannical oppression, but as these men do now to
take away our Sacraments and sacrifice, and to leave us nothing* but the
bare name of Christ, and if there be any good man, that has true religion in
his heart, to compel him to keep it within him, yt he shall not express it
outward lie? and in very deed diverse notable and godly writers at this day,
call this heresye against ye sacrifice of the church which Luther first began
and most manteyned, by this name Secta Mahumetica. the sect of mahomet.

But for ye auoydinge of these absurdities and for such causes as I shall God
willinge declare hereafter, I presuppose this foundation of christ's body, to
be really present in the blessed sacrament, to be steadfastly believed of us all,
upon the which I build all that remains now to be said.

Which foundation, although it has been undermined of many men and many
ways, and therefore requires a full and perfect treatise to be made of it
alone: yet as I intend not to occupye all this time in that, so I may not well
so sclenderlye leave it, that has been so much and often assaulted, but
shall declare the sum of that moves me to continue still in that truth I
was borne in, to keep still that faith I was baptized in and put on Christ,
which faith seeing it is universal, if I should leave it, I should forsake
Christ, and be an heretic, not following that form of doctrine I received of
my fathers, and they of theyrs from the beginning, but choosinge my self a
new way and new masters that please me, being so condemned by mine own
conscience and judgment, which is the very propertye and definition of an
heretic.

There be three things, that hold me^^ this faith: the manifest and plain
scripture, the uniform aucthorities of holy men, and the consent of the
universal church. These three be the arguments, that a christen man may
stick unto, and never be deceived, specially if they be knytte and joined
together, concerning one matter, but if they be separate, then some of the^ be
but weak staffes to lean unto. As for example. The scripture without the
consent of the church is a weapon as mete for an heretic, as for a catholic,
for Arius, Nestorius, and such other heretics did allege the scripture for
their opinions, as the catholics did, but their alledgynge was but the abusyng
of the letter, which is indifferent to good and evil, and deprauyng of the
true sense, which is only known by the tradition and consent of the catholic
church: so that the one without the other is not a direction, but a seduction
to a simple man, because the very scripture in deed, is not the bare letter,
as it lies to be taken of every man, but ye true sense, as it is delivered by
the universal consent of Christ's church.

Likewise the wrytynges and sayings of the fathers, if they be but the mind
of one man without the consent of other, were he never so well learned and
virtuous, otherwise yet his wrytynges I say in that point be not a
confirmation for an ignoraunte manne to hold him in the truth, but a
temptation to seduce him, and pull him from the truth.

The consent of the church is always a sure staff, the very pyller of
truth, whether it be in things expressed in ye letter of the scripture, or in
things delivered unto us by tradition of the Apostles. He that holds him by
this staff ca^ not fall in faith, but stand in truth.

Now concerning this matter of the present, I am able by Gods help to show
all these three things, joined and knitte together so, that we can not be
deceived in this point, except we will deceive our selves as many wilfully do.

The scripture by plain and manifest words, against the which hell gates
shall never prevail, does testifye and confyrme our faith in many places,
but specially in the words of our savior Christ him self in his last
supper, saying to his Disciples: Mat. 26.
Take, eat this is my body, which is given for you. This is my blood of the
new Testament, which is shed for many and for you in remission of sins:
which most plain scriptures many have gone about to delude, and to reduce
the^ to a base understanding by figurative speches, contendyng, these words,
This is my body, This is my blood to be spoken figuratiuelye, and not as the
words purport: because other like sayings in the scripture be taken
figuratively, as these: I am the way, I am the door, The stone is Christ and
such other, wherein they have declared their deuelyshe and detestable
sophistrye too their own damnation and the subversion of a great many other.

They profess them selfs to be learned men, but who heard ever tell of
any such kind of learning, as to prove one singular by an other, as if one
should reason thus: Thomas is an honest manne, ergo John is an honest man: The
swan is white, ergo the crow is white.

Which arguments be like this: I am the way, is a figurative speech, ergo
likewise, This is my body, is a figurative speech. With such fond folyes and
sophismes is the truth assaulted against all good learning, and the rules of
all true reasonyng. GOD open their eyes to see, and follow his heavenly wisdom.

But if we will consider the circu^stancies of the text, who was the speaker,
for what intent, what time, and such other: it shall plainly appear that the
literal sense, as the words purporte, is the true sense, that the holy Ghost
did principally intend. As for example. First it appears euidentlye, the
speaker to be Jesus Christ our Lord, Gods son, equal and omnipotent God
with the father, and that these his words be not words of a bare narration
and teaching, but words whereby a sacrament is instituted. And for that reason
we must considre, that it is otherwise with Christ, then with us, for in man
the word is true, when the thing is true, whereof it is spoken: In God the
thing is true, when the word is spoken of the thing. Man's word declares the
thing to be as it is before, Gods word makes the thing to be, as it was not
before.

In man the truth of his word depends of the truth of the thing. Contrary
in God the truth of the thing depends upon the speaking of the word, as
the Psalm says: psalm. 148.
Ipse dixit and facta sunt He spoke the word, and the things were made. And
this thing the devil knew well enough, being sure that if Jesus were Christ
and God, he could with his word both create new things, and also change the
nature and substance of any thing: and therefore said unto him temptyng him,
whether he was Gods son or no: Mat. 4.
if thou be Gods son, speak the word, that these stoones may be made
bread. Wherbi we may learn that although in ma^s speech it is not true to
say, these stones be bread: yet if GOD should say so, it should be true, the
inferior nature of creatures gyuyng place to the omnipotent power of God the
creator.

After which sort Ireneus reasons against those heretics, that denied Jesus
Christ to be Gods son, vsyng that most constantly believed truth of the
sacrament, that we hold now grounded upon Christ's words, for an argument to
convince Jesus the speaker to be Gods son. His words be these. Quomodo
autem constabit eis, Ireneus lib. 4. ca. 34.
eum panem in quo gratiae actae sunt corpus esse domini sui, and calicem
sanguinis eius si non ipsum fabricatoris mundi filium dicant? How shall it be
certain unto them, that that bread upon which thanks are given (that is to
say the Eucharistical bread) is ye body of their Lord, and the cup of his
blood, if they say not that he is the son of him yt made the world? as
though he should reason thus: These words which Jesus spoke of the blessed
bread, saying: This is my body, This is the cup of my blood, be either
true or false. If the speaker of them be pure man and not god as they say, then
can they not be true: for man's word changes not the nature of things, as it
is here. But if the words be true, as they certeynlye believe, then the
speaker of the^ must needs be gods son, of infinite power, able to make the
things to be as he says they be. And also in his. 57. Chapter the fame.
Ireneus li. 4. ca 57
4. book, he makes the like argument in these words. Quomodo just Dominus
si alte rius patris existit huius conditionis quae est secundum nos, accipiens
panem suum corpus confitebatu^, and temperamentum calicis, sui sanguinem
co^firmauit? If our Lord be a pure man, of that nature and condition, that we
be of, the son of an other father then God: How did he justly and truly
taking bread into his hand, confess and say it to be his body, and confirm
that mixture of wine and water, that was in the chalyce, to be his own blood?

By these two places of Ireneus that lived within. 150. years of Christ, we
are taught not to fly to our figures of grammar to make these words of
Christ true, which in deed we must needs do, or else say they be false, if
Christ the speaker be but only man and not God: but we be taught by him to be
leave them to be most true, and for that reason to believe also, that Christ the
speaker is Gods son, by whose almighty power the things be changed and made
as he speaks: so that we may justly, after the mind of Ireneus and diverse
other old auctours, which were long to rehearse now, conceive this opinion
of these men, that say these words of christ can not be true, except they be
understood by a figurative speech: that they either believe not them selfs,
yt Christ is Gods son, or else give occasion to other, to revive that old
damnable heresye of Arius, that denied Christ's Godheade, thexperience whereof
we have had of late days, of some that from Sacramentaries by necessary
consequence of that heresye, became Arianes.

The second circumstance I spoke o^, was ^o considre to what purpose and
intent Christ spoke these words, and I said they were words not of a bare
narration teaching some doctrine, but the words of thinstitution of a
Sacrament of the new Testamente. And then it follows, that if they be the
form of a Sacrament, as they be in deed: then must they needs be that
instrument whereby Gods almighty power assistinge the dew ministration of his
priest, works that grace inwardly, that the words purport outwardlye. For so
it is in all other Sacraments. In Baptism, these words, Ego baptizote, I
baptize thee, and so forth, like as outwardly to the ears, of the hearer they
signify a washing so almighty God assisting the due pronouncing of the^,
does inwardlye work the grace of washing the soul of him, to whom the
words be spoken if there be no stop or impediment of his party.

And likewise in penance as the words of the Priest saying: Ego absoluo te
ab omni bus peccatis tuis in nomine Patris, and filij, and spiritus sancti, I
absolve thee from all thy sins in the name of the father, and the son, and
the holy ghost, do signify forgiveness, so God does inwardly forgive if the
party be truly penitent.

Likewise in marriage that knotte the man knitteth with the woman in taking her
to his wife, and she him to her husband, God also inwardly does knitte the
same, which manne can not lowse: and so forth of al other Sacraments.

Now to our purpose: The grace which is included in these words, This is my
body, This is my blood, is not only accidental grace as in the other, but the
body of Christ to be our Sacrament, which is the substance of grace, the
aucthor, fountain, and well of al grace, as S. Bernarde says Dicitur
Eucharistia per excellentiam. Bernard. Ser. de Caena.
In hoc enim Sacramento non solum quaelibet gratia, sed ille a quo est omnis
gratia sumitur. This Sacrament is called Eucharistia, for some excellencye
above al other, for in this sacrament is received not only any other grace,
but he of whom proceeds al grace.

Then it follows, yt whereas the grace of this sacrament, which the words
purport to the outward ears of all men, is the essential grace of Christ's
body and blood to be there present, it follows, I say that Christ by these
words, as by a convenient instrument, works inwardlye, in that he gave to
his disciples y^ real presence of his own body and blood, Emesenus orat. de
corpore and sanguine Christi
as Eusebius Emesenus says: Fide aestimandi non specie, nec exterioris
censenda est uisu, sed interioris hominis affectu. To be esteemed by faith, and
not by the outward form, and not to be judged by the sight of the outward
man, but by the affection of the inward man.

Thirdly we may considre, that these words be the performance of a former
promise, where Christ (as it is written in the.6. Chapter of S. John)
promised to give us ye same flesh to eat, that he would give to the death
for the life of the world, saying: Panis quem ego dabo caro mea est, John. 6.
quam ego dabo pro mundi uita. The bread which I shall give unto you, is my
flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.

Which promise we never read, that Christ which is ye very truth and can
not lie, did ever at any time perform but in his last supper, when he gave his
body and blood to his disciples: and to promise his flesh, and to give bare
bread and not his flesh, is no performyng, but a breaking of his promise, and
a deludynge of them, to whom he made the promise: for as for the
interpretation, which some men make of Christ's words, that he will give his
flesh to us to be eaten spirituallye by says is but a vain and feined gloss
for that text.

And although Christ do so give it to be eaten by faith, yet we may not
exclude one truth by an other truth, as sophisters do. For Christ gave his
flesh to us to be eaten spirituallye by faith, ever from the beginning of the
world, and also at that present, when he spoke those words, so that it were a
very vain thing for Christ to promise to give a thing, which he ever before,
and also at that present, and ever after continually does give.

But it was never so taken of any good ancient aucthor which al with one
consent do expound this text of Saint John, of the giving of his flesh in his
last supper under the form of bread, and therefore Cirillus writes, Cirillus
in Joan. lib 4 cap. 14.
that our savior Christ did not expound and make plain the manner of the
misterye, and the performaunce of this his promise, to them that asked the
unfaithful question. How, without faith, but to his disciples that believed
him and asked no such question of him, he declared the manner of it in his last
supper.

Wherefore we may well conclude upon this circumstance, that Christ's flesh is
verelye present in the Sacrament to be given unto us, because he promised
before, that he would give us the same flesh for our food, that he would give
on the cross for our redemption.

The time also is to be considered, that he spoke these words the night
before he suffered death, at which time and the next day after he ended and
fulfilled all fygures saying on the cross: Consummatum est. All figures and
shadows be ended and expired, which was no time, then to institute and
begin new figures.

It is likely or probable, that our Savior Christ then enteryng into his agony
and beginnynge his passion, accustomynge commonly before to teach his
disciples in plain words, without parables or figurative speeches: would
then so lightly behave him self as to delude his choysen and intierlye beloved
disciples, in calling those things his body, that is given for them, and his
blood, that is shed for them, which were neither his body nor his blood,
but bare bread and wine?

Or is there any religion in our christen faith in nycknanamyng things, or
calling the^ otherwise, then they be?

If any man think him self able to answer that, because Christ said he was a
vine, he was a door, being neither vine nor door: that man seems to me not
substantiallye to way the words and speeches of scripture.

For let him considre thoroughoute all the Scripture, wheresoever he shall
find, that Christ spoke any thing of him self by words of our common
speech (for the godhead and the properties of the god head be ineffable, and
can not be expressed to our capacitye, but by words and names of worldly and
natural things here among us.) He shall always find, that Christ was a
better and more syngulare thing then the word did properlye signifye, that was
attribute unto him, and to make this matter more plain by examples.

Where Christ said, I am the way, he meant not, that he was the way, that
leads to the city, or to some other place but that he was a more excellent
way: A way that leads to the father, to heaven, to everlasting life.

When he said, he was the door, he meante not, John. 10
that he was the door of the shepefold here in earth, but a far better
door, the door of the church, the spiritual shepefolde, by the which door
who soever enters, shall be saved.

Also calling him self a vine he meant that he was the spiritual vine, John.
15
whereof all christen men be branches, and better then such a vine, as
grows in the fields.

And likewise by that he calls himself the light, we understand, that he
was not the sensible light of this world but the heavenly light* that neither
by course is changed, nor by shadow is darkened.

So that it may be observed for a rule, when Christ does attribute the name
of any sensible creature to him self, ever the understanding exceadeth and
excels the word in dignity.

And if this be true in all kind of teaching and doctrine shall we now in the
high mysteries and sacraments of God, come from the hall to the kitchen, from
the better to the worst? yt where Christ says, This is my body, we shall
understand, that it is bread a worse thing, then his body, This is my
blood, that is to say, wine a worse thing then his blood? These be fond and
false gloses, neither true, nor likely, nor yet tolerable.

Wherefore leaving out a great many other circumstancies, that would serve
very well, to set forth the truth of this doctrine, I shall conclude thus,
seeing S. Matthew says in plain terms, Mat. 26.
it is my body, it is my blood: Mar. 14.
S. Mark says, it is my body: Luke. 22
S. Luke says, it is my body: S. Paul says, it is my body: 1. cor. 11*
S. John says, it is my flesh, John. 6.
shall we now fyftene hundredth year after them, handle the matter so finelye,
and way the scripture so substantiallye, that we shall affirm the
contradictorye to be the true sense, saying this is not my body, this is not
my blood, but a figure and a sign of my body and blood? These evident
scriptures move me to continue still steadfast in that faith I was borne in, and
not to be moved with vain words and reasons without probabilitye against all
rule and form of true reasonyng.

Moreover the nature of a sacrament does move me very much to believe still,
as I do. For whereas every sacrament of the new Testament, is a visible form
of an invisible grace, as S. Augustyne says it can not be a sacrament of y^
new Testamente, except it have a promise of some, such grace to be given to
the worthy receauer, as is signified by the outward form of the sacrament.
As in baptism the water, which is the outward form, signifies the grace of
salvation and remission of sins, which grace is both given to the worthy
receauer, and is also promised in scripture to be given, Mar. 1^.
by the mouth of christ saying: Qui crediderit and baptizatus fuerit, saluus
erit: He that believes and is baptized, shall be saved.

Even so the outward element of this sacrament, which is bread and wine, does
signifye the grace of the unity of Christ's mystical body, that like as one
bread is made of many graynes, one wine is pressed out of many grapes: so one
mystical body of Christ is compact and united of the multitude of all Christen
people, as S. Cypriane says. Cyprian. li. 1. epi. 6


Now if our sacrament be bread and wine, as they say, then shall they find
the promise of this grace, or of some other in the scriptures made to the
receauer of bread and wine. And if there be no promise in all the scriptures
made to the receiving of bread and wine, then be they no sacraments: But if
they will look in the sixth chapter of S* John, they shall find this grace of
the mystical unity promised, John. 6,
not to the receauynge of bread and wine, but to the worthy receauyng of
Christ's body and blood: where Christ says, he that eats my flesh, and
drynketh my blood, he abides in me, and I in him, and so is joined and
incorporate into one mystical body with him.

Our sacrament therefore, that has the promise annexed unto it, is not bread
and wine, be they never so much appointed to signifye heavenly things (as
they say) but the very body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, the bread
that came from heaven.

Luther and such as be of his sect, as take his dreams for the ground of
their faith, were much pressed with this argument deduced of the propertye of
the sacrament, and saw plainly, that it could not be a sacrament of the new
testament, except it had a promise annexed to the worthy vsyng of it. And yet
for all that, he would not condescende to say as the Church says, that res
Sacrame^ti: the thing of the sacrament signified, and not contained, which is
the unity of the mystical body, were that grace which by Christ in S. John was
promised to the worthy receauer of it: but went and sought about for an other
promise, and after much pooringe at last he brought forth a promise (as he
thought) mete and conueniente, which is the words of christ. Quod pro uobis
tradetur. ^. cor. 11,
which shall be given for you. And in this point he showed, with what violence he
handled other matters of our faith, that in this great matter so much
ouershotte himself.

First with what face could he call, that a promise which has no apparaunce
of any promise, but that the words in Latyne be spoken in the future tense,
which in Greek be written in the present tense, both in Saint Paul, and in S.
Luke: Quod pro uobis datur, which is given for you. And if they were spoken in
ye future tense, as they were not yet they be words not promising a thing to
be done, but declaryng what shall be done.

And further if we should grant them to be words of a promise, yet they
promise not the grace of the sacrament, which is to be given to the worthy
receauer* For the passion of Christ, or the giuinge of Christ's body upon the
cross, is not a grace given by the sacrament to the receauer, but it is that
work, that has deserved grace to be given by the sacrament, for all our
sacraments take their virtue of ye passion of Christ, and do not promise the
passion of Christ.

This may suffice for this short time to show unto you the folly of these
men, that neither wot nor care what they affirm in these weyghty matters. I
could say more in it, but that I have more necessary matter behind to be
said.

August. in Joan. Tract. 4. In Psalm. 138
S. Augustyne in diverse places, and other ancient aucthors have this doctrine
in their books. E latere Christi fluxerunt duo Sacramenta: Two Sacraments did
issue forth of christ's side, and in those places he teaches us by comparyng
the creation of Eve, the wife of Adam the first man, and of the church y^
spouse of christ the second man. Like as god castyng Ada^ into a sleep, took
forth a bone out of his side, and thereof builded and created him a wife: even
so when Christ did sleep by death upon the cross, upon water and blood that
came forth of his side, when it was opened with a spear, God did form and
build the church the spouse of Christ, in that by water we be regenerate, by
blood we be redeemed and nourished.

Now concerning our purpose, if two sacraments came out of Christ's side, we
are sure there came out no wine, except ye will say the wine of the true
vine, which christ shall never drink with us any more, but after anewe sort in
the glory and kingdom of his father. Therefore it must needs be, that our
sacrament is Christ's blood and not wine.

Beside these circumstancies and arguments deduced upon the scripture, there
be also other of no less strength then these, able to confirm any true
Christen man in the faith of the real presence of Christ's body and blood in
the blessed sacrament.

And these be the effects of the sacrament expressed in the scripture, which
be so great, so gloriouse, so excellent and heavenly, that it were great
blasphemy to ascribe the same to bread and wine, which be only the works and
effects of almighty GOD, and of such creatures only, as gods son has taken
and united to him self in unity of person which be the body and blood of our
Savior Christ.

The first effect is, that our Sacrament is the confirmation of the new
Testament, as S. Mathewe and S. Mark also do write: Mat. 26. Mar. 14.
Hic est sanguis meus noui Testamenti, This is my blood of the new Testament,
that is to say: which confirms the new Testament, as all holy writers do
expound. Like as the blood of calves did confirm the old Testament, as the
book of Exodus does declare: so the blood of Christ our priest, Exo. 24.
and sacrifice does confirm the new Testament, which Testament because it is
eternal and shall never have end, is confirmed by the eternal blood of the
lamb of God, that ever is received and never consumed, and not by any
corruptible blood, or any other creature* of less value and efficacy.

In the old law, and also in S. Paul it is said. Exo. 24. Heb. 9.
Hic est sanguis Testamenti, quod uobis cum pepigit Deus, This is the blood of
the Testament, that god has covenant with you: he says not, This is the
blood of the new Testament. But if these words (This is my blood of the
new Testament) the Evangelist had meant, that it had been the figure of the
blood of the new Testament, what had he said more then Moses said before:
for the blood of calves and gotes was the figure of this blood of Christ.
And then were the Jews and the old law of more dignity, then we Christen men
of the new law, because beside we both (...) but under figures (as these men
say) yet their figure was of more estima^ion, (...) ours is, being (as they
say) but ^are bread and wine: wherefore seeing these words of Christ. (this
is my blood) be y^ ^rme of our Sacrament, the effect whereof is the
confirmation of the new Testament, it follows well, that the cause must be of
like or more dignity, and so by no means can be ye material creature of wine,
but must needs be the innocent and preciouse blood of our immaculate and
undefiled lamb of God Jesus Christ.

An other effect of this Sacrament is taught us in S. Luke, Luke. 24
the.24. chapter of his Gospel, where our savior Christ sat down with
his two Disciples that went to Emaus, and taking bread, blessed it, and
brake it, and gave it to them, and then their eyes were opened, and they knew
him.

S. Augustyne in his book De consensu Euangelistarum teaches us to understand
this place of the blessed bread, August. de co^sensu Euangelistaru^. lib. 3.
ca. 25.
which is the sacrament of the aultare, and says: the effect of it is to open
our eyes, that we may know god.

And Theophilactus upon this place of saint Luke writes this. Theophilact. in
Lucam. ca. 24.
Insinuatur et aliud quiddam, nempe quod oculi eorum qui benedictu^ panem
assumunt, aperiuntur, ut agnoscant illum, magnam enim and indicibilem uim habet
caro Domini. By this scripture an other thing is given us to understand, that
the eyes of them which receive this blessed bread, be opened, that they might
know him: for the flesh of our Lord has a great and unspeakable virtue.

Here we may perceive both by the scripture, and also by ye holy Doctors and
Fathers, that the effect of this Sacrament is the opening of our eyes to
know God, and that the cause of that is the flesh of Christ, which is our
sacrament, and in no wise can be either bread or wine.

An other effect is the immortalitye of our bodies and souls the resurrection
of our flesh to everlasting life, to have life eternal dwelling in us.

This effect is declared in the syxt of S. John: He that eats me, John. 6,
shall live for me, he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood* has
everlasting life, and I shall raise him up in the last day.

Upon this place Cirillus says: Ego enin dixit, Cirillus libr. 4. cap. 15.
id est corpus meum quod comedetur resuscitabo eum: ego igitur inquit qui homo
factus sum per meam carnem in nouissimo die comedentes resuscitabo. Christ
says I (that is to say) my body which shall be eaten, shall raise him up, I
that am made man by my flesh shall raise up the^ that eat it in the last day.

And in his. 10. book he says more plainly: Cyrillus in Joan. lib. 10* ca.
13.
Non potest aliter corruptibilis haec natura corporis ad incorruptibili tatem
and uitam traduci, nisi naturalis uitae corpus ei coni^ngeretur. This
corruptible nature of our bodies can not otherwise be brought to immortalitye
and life, except the body of natural life be joined to it.

By these aucthorities we learn, that the effect of Christ's body in the
sacrament, is the raysyng up of our bodies to eternal life. And also we
learn, that the eating of christ's body is not only spiritually by faith (as
the sacramentaries say) but also corporally by the service of our bodies, when
Christ's body in the sacrament is eaten and received of our bodies, as our
spiritual food: and because it is of infinite power, it is not converted into
the substance of our flesh, as other corruptible meats be, but it does
change and convert our flesh into his propertye, making it of mortal and
dead, immortal and lively.

As the same Cyrillus writes in his.4. book: Cirillus libr. 4. cap. 14.
Recordare quamuis naturaliter aqua frigidior sit, aduentu tamen ignis
frigiditatis suae oblita aestuat: Hoc sane modo etiam nos, qua^uis propter
naturam carnis corruptibiles sumus participatione tamen uitae ab imbecillitate
nostra reuocati, ad proprietatem illius ad uitam reformamur. Oportuit enim
certe, ut non solu^ anima per spiritum sanctum in beatam uitam ascenderet.
ueru^ etiam ut rude atque terrestre hoc corpus cognato sibi gustu, tactu and
cibo ad immortalitatem reduceretur. The Englysh is this. Remember how water
although it be cold by nature, yet by reason of fire put to it, it forgets
the cold, and waxes hoate: even so do we, although we be corruptible by
reason of the nature of our flesh, yet by participation of (Christ's flesh
which is) life, we are brought from our weakness, and reformed to his
proprietye, that is to say, to life for it is necessary that not only our
soul should ascend to an happy (and spiritual) life, by receauyng the holy
ghost, but also yt this rude and earthly body should be reduced to
immortality by ta^ynge, touching, and corporal meat like to it self.

This place is very plain declarynge unto us, that like as our souls are
revived from the death of sin to the life of grace and glory by the
receauynge of Gods sprite the holy ghost in baptism: even so our bodies being
corruptible by nature, and dead by reason of the general sentence of death, are
restored again to life eternal and celestial, by the receauynge of Christ's
lively flesh into them after the manner of meat in this sacrament of the
aultare.

And in his eleventh book he says, Cyrillus lib. 11. ca. 27.
that it is not possible for the corruptible nature of man to ascend to
immortalitye: except the immortal nature of Christ do reform and promote it
from mortalitye to life eternal by participation of his immortal flesh.

Here perchance some men will stumble, considering that we believe the bodies of
young innocents shall rise to everlasting life, which we know never received
Christ's flesh in the sacrament.

But their dout in this point may soon be resolved, if they consider that
scripture and the old fathers, speak after the ordinary workyng of GOD,
making no prejudice to the absolute power of God, who oftentimes gives the
propre grace of the sacraments before the outward receauynge of the same. As
for example. Without Baptysme in water and the holy ghost, no man can enter
into the kingedome of heaven, as S. Ihon writes. John. ^.
Yet we read, that the the^e on the right hand of Christ was saved and never
baptized, and many converted suddenly to our faith were made martyrs before they
could come to baptism in water.

And saint Ambrose thinks V^lentinian the Emperor to be saved, which dyed
in his iourneye before saint Ambrose which he sent for, could come unto him.

And therefore though baptism be necessary, and the ordinary door to
salvation, yet the propre grace of baptism is sometimes given by Gods
extraordinarye and absolute power to such, as without contempt of the
sacrament by their will and earneste desire receive the sacrament of baptism,
though not in deed: eue^ so they that be baptized, and have an earnest desire
and longyng to receive Christ's body and blood in the sacrament and by some
violence or impediment are let to receive it in deed: or such children as
by baptism have faith infused into their hearts, and are prevented by death
before they can prove and try the^ selfs, ^. cor. 11.
which probation saint Paul seems too require before the receypte o^ Christ's
body having no contempt nor refusal of the same, but depart in the faith of
christ: These I say receive the grace of the sacrament, which is the
immortality of their bodies and life eternal by Gods extraordinary workyng,
without the receypte of the sacrament in deed. By this little ye may perceive,
what may be further said to this objection, if the time and my principal
matter would suffer me.

This effect is commonly taught of many ancient aucthors with one consent.
For Ignatius one of the oldest calls this sacrament medicamentum
immortalitatis, Ignatius ad Ephesos.
antidotum non moriendi, a medicine of immortalitye, a preservative against
death.

And the great general counsel at Nice, Conciliu^ Nicenum de Eucharistia.
writes that they believed these sacraments of the body and blood of Christ
to be Symbola resurrectionis nostrae, the pledges or causes of our resurrection.

And Athanasius who was one of the chief men in that counsel, Athanasius de
peccato in spiritum sanctum.
calls it Conseruatorium ad immortalitatem uitae aeternae A conserve or a
thing that preserves our bodies to the immortality of eternal life.

Ireneus that was a great deal older writing against the heretics, Ireneus
lib. 4. ca. 34.
that denied the resurrection of the flesh, proves it and confuteth them by
the effect of this sacrament saying thus: Quomodo dicunt carnem in
corruptionem deuenire, quae a corpore and sanguine Domini alitur? By what
reason do they say, that our flesh goes wholly to corruption, seeing that it is
nouryshed with the body and blood of our Lord? and in his fyfte book he
says: Quomodo carnem negant capacem esse donationis Dei, Ireneus lib. 5.
quae est uita aeterna, quae sanguine and corpore Christi nutritur? How do
they deny our flesh to be able to receive the gift of god which is eternal
life, which is nouryshed with the body and blood of Christ?

The greateste argument that Ireneus could bring to prove the resurrection of
our flesh to life eternal, was to allege the cause of that resurrection,
which was the nouryshynge of our flesh with the lyue^ye flesh of Christ in
the sacrament not to this temperal life as other earthly meats do, but to
eternal life, as only Christ's flesh does, and this cause was believed and
confessed of al men at that time, both catholykes and heretics. Insomuche that
these heretics of our time, that deny this cause, that is to say, Christ's
flesh to be really given in the sacrament, and eaten of our flesh, do give
occasion, yea I am affrayed do give more then occasion for us to think of
them, that they deny also the resurrection of our flesh, which is the propre
effect of it, although as yet they dare not impudentlye burste out with it in
plain words, though they express the same evidently to all men's eyes in
their carnal and beastly lives.

To prove this effect further I could bring in many mo aucthorities, Hilariu^
de trinit. lib. 8.
as the saying of Hilalarius. Haec uero uitae nostrae causa est, quod in nobis
carnalibus manente^ per carne^ Christum habemus This is the very cause of our
life, y^ we have Christ by his flesh dwelling in our flesh.

But I will not in so plain a matter, through my curiosity seem to mistrust the
credit of you, that be faithful men. Therefore to conclude, knowing the
greatness and thexcellencye of this effect, shall we ascribe it to so basse
creatures as be bread and wine, which be not able to work such an effect?
God forbid.

The principal effect of all is to make us one body with Christ, which is
declared in saint Paul, in these words: Panis quem frangimus, 1. cor. 10,
nonne communicatio corporis Christi est? The bread which we break, is it
not the communion of Christ's body (that is to say) does it not join and
knitte us in the unity of one body of Christ?

Upon the which place of saint Paul Chrysostom notes, Chrysostom. in Paul. 1.
Cor. 10
that he said not (it is the participation) but it is the communion of one
body. Declarynge thereby the higheste and greatest conjunction that can be,
saving the unity of person: for the bread which we break, that is to say,
the natural body of Christ under the form of bread, which we break and
divide among us, not taking every man a sondrye part, but every man taking
the whole and the same: And as Cyrill says, Cyrillus libr 12. ca, 32.
Gods son going into every man, as it were by division of him self, yet
remains whole without any division in every manne: this bread (I say) is
the communion of Christ's body, that is to say, makes us that be diverse in
our own substance to be all one mystical body in Christ, endued all with
one holy spirit, whereby ye influence of Christ's grace, that is our head, is
derived and deduced unto us, that be members of his body, flesh of his flesh,
and bones of his bones.

Thus does Chrysostom expound ye words of S. Paul. Chrysostom. in Paul. 1.
Cor. 10
Quid enim appello (inquit) communicationem? idem ipsum corpus sumus: quidnam
est panis? corpus Christi: quid aute^ fiunt, qui accipiunt corpus Christi? no^
multa sed unum corpus. What means S. Paul, when he says (the communion) he
means that we be all one body: What means he by this word (bread) the body
of christ What are they made, that receive the body of Christ? they are made
not many bodies, but one body. And therefore S. Paul says by and by after,
unus panis unum corpus multi sumus, omnes enim de uno pane participamus. We
that be many, are made one bread one body, forbecause all we do receive and
eat of one bread.

Here he tells plain, why we that be many in number, are all made one
bread, one mystical body, because (says he) all we eat of one bread,
which is one natural body. And this word (bread) here must needs be taken
for Christ's natural body, and not for material bread (as the heretics say)
for it can not be conceived, neither by reason, nor by faith, how that al we
christen folks that live now, and have lived since Christ's time, and shall
live till domesdaye, can eat all of one and the same bread, and eat also at
sundry times al of the same one bread being one bread in number, and not one
bread in kind (as some would make cauillation) seeing we be not fed cum
generibus and speciebus, with kinds of bread (as the Logityanes say) but with
singular bread: except we understand by this one bread the bread of life,
that came from heaven, the bread of Christ's natural body in the sacrament,
which he promised to give unto us all, whereof (as S. Cypriane says, Cyprian.
de caena Domin^.
Aequa omnibus portio datur, in teger erogatur, distributus non dimembratur,
incorporatur non iniu^iatur, and so forth* whereof equal portion is given to al,
this delivered whole, and being distributed, is not disme^bred, and being
incorporate in to us, is not iniuryed, and being received, is not included, and
dwelling with those that be weak, is not made weak.

And the reason why all we should be made one body, that receive one body, is
declared in Cyrill, the Latin is long* Cyrillus de Trini. lib. 1.
but the English is this: We men being all diverse in our own propre
substance, according to y^ which one man is Peter, an other is Thomas, an
other Mathewe: yet are we al made one body in Christ, because we be fed with
one flesh, and are sealed in unity with one holy spirit: and because
Christ's body is not able to be divided, therefore being of infinite power, and
received of al our diverse bodies, makes all us one body with him self.

Which unity of body S. Chrysostom expressth by a similitude of dough and
leuine, that we are made one body, Chrysostom in Matt. (...). 83
as mele of many granes and water, when it is knedde, are made one doughe or
leuyne: his words be these. Veniat tibi in mentem, quo sis honor honoratus,
qua mensa fruaris: ea namque re nos alimur, quam angeli uidentes tremunt, nec
absque pauore propter fulgorem, qui in de resilit aspicere possunt, et nos in
unam cum illo massam reducimur* Christi corpus unum and caro una. etc. Remember
with what honor thou art honored, of what table thou eatest: for we are fed
with yt thing, at which the angels lokyng upon, do tremble and quake, and
without great fear be not able to behold it for the brightness, that comes
from it, and we are brought into one heap of leuine with him, being one body
of Christ and one flesh, for by this mystery he joins himself to all the
faithful and those children, whom he has brought forth, he does not commit
them to be nourished of an other, but he him self most diligently and lovingly
does feed them with him self.

Let my masters of the new learning tell me, how that these words can be
any ways applied and verifyed of bread and wine with all their figurative
speeches and hyperbolyes.

This conjunction also of us with CHRIST, Cyrill expresses by a similitude of
two waxes melted and mengled together. Cyrillus lib. 10. ca 17. and lib. 4. ca.
17.
Quemadmodu^ si quis igne liquefactam ceram aliae cerae similiter liquefactae
ita miscuerit, ut unum quid ex utrisque factum uideatur: sic co^municatione
corporis and sanguinis Christi ipse in nobis est, and nos in ipso etc. Like as
if a man mingle one wax, melted with an other wax melted, so that one whole
thing of them both be seen to be made: even so by the communion and receauynge
of Christ's body and blood, he is in us and we in him, for otherwise the
corruptible nature of our bodies could not be brought to incorruption, except
the body of natural life were joined to it.

Hilarious also the great learned and godly bishop says: per communionem
sancti corporis, Hilarious in psa. 6^
in communione^ deinceps sancti corporis collocamur. By the communion of his
holy body, we are afterward placed and brought into the communion of his holy
body,

In such a plain matter as this is, what need I to heap places one above
another, all the fathers be full of it. Wherefore seeing the effect of this
sacrament is to be made one mystical body with Christ, flesh of his flesh,
and boones of his boones, Ephesians. 5. Cyrillus libr 10. ca, 13. Hilarious de
Trini. lib. 8
as saint Paul says: which union (as Cyrill says) is not only by will,
affection, faith, and charity, but also carnal and natural (as Hilarye says)
by Christ's flesh mingled with our flesh by the way of meat: I can not see,
but that it is great wickedness and plain blasphemy to ascribe this gloriouse
effect to the nedye elements of this world, as to bread and wine, but only
to the body and blood of our savior Christ, as to the only substance of
the blessed sacrament of the aultare.

Beside these effects gathered out of the new Testament, there be also other
mentioned in the Psalms. Whereof one is, that this sacrament is an armoure and
defense against the temptations of our ghostlye enemy the devil, as it is
written in the.22. Psalm. Parasti in conspectu meo mensam aduersus eos qui
tribulant me. Psalm* 22.
Thou haste prepared in my sight a table against the^ that trouble me.

Chrysostom In Psalm. 22.
By this table (says Chrysostom upon this place) is understood that thing
that is consecrated upon the aultare of our Lord: Euthymi in Psa. 22
and Euthymius a greek author says so also: Per hanc mensam intelligit
altaris mensam, in qua coena mystica illa iacet: by this table he understands
the table of the aultare, upon which lies the mystical supper of Christ,
which does arm and defend us against the devil, which some times craftly
lays in wait for us, sometimes fyersly and cruelly assaulteth us, that be
fed at Christ's table.

S. Cypriane teaches us the same lesson, saying: Quos excitamus and exhortamur
ad praelium non inermes and nudos relinquamus, Cyprianus. lib. ^ epist. ^.
sed protection^ sanguinis and corporis Christi muniamus: Those persons whom
we provoke and exhort to fight against their enemies (be it either the devils
our ghostly enemies, or y^ deuyls limbs the persecutours of Christ's Church)
let us not leave the^ naked and unarmed, but let us harness and defend them
with the protection of Christ's body and blood.

And a little after he says: Cum ad hoc fiat Eucharistia, ut possit
accipientibus esse tutela, quos tutos esse contra aduersarium uolumus,
munimento dominicae saturitatis armemus. Seeing this Sacrament is ordained for
this purpose, yt it should be a defense to the receyuers, let us arm the^ with
the shield and harness of our lords meat, whom we would should be saffe
against their adversary.

This is that food, that makes a man mete, and prepares him too martyrdom.
This blood of Christ is dronken daily of us, Cyprianus. lib. 4 epist. 6
Cryprian libro. 2. epist. 3,
yt we might in his quarrel shed our blood again: and as he writes in an
other place: how can we shed our blood for Christ, that be ashamed to
drink Christ's blood?

Chrysostom in 10 an. hom. 45
This blood being received of us (as Chrysostom says) drives the deuyls
away, Chrysostom. ad Neophitos.
and does allure the angels and the Lord of angels unto us: for after the
meat of our Lord received, he forsakes us, and flies away swifter, then any
wind, and dare not approach near, because all entrance for his temptations
is shut up. As S. Ambrose writes. Cum hospitium tuum aduersarius uiderit
occupatum coelestis fulgore praesentiae, Ambrose in Psalm. 118. Ser. 8
intelligens locum tentamentis suis interclusum esse per Christum, fugiet
acrecedet. etc. When thy adversary shall see thy house and lodgyng (of body and
soul) occupied with the bryghtnesse of Christ's heavenly presence perceauyng
every place to be shut up from his temptations: he wylll fly and run away

Wherefore as Gregorye Nazianzene writes: Nazian. in Iulianu^ orat, 2.
Mensa haec praeparatur contra tribulantes me, qua omnem passionum rebellionem
sedo. This table is prapared of God against them that vex and trouble me, by
the which I quench and pacifye all rebellion of my naughtye affections.

And (as Cyrill says) Non mortem solum, Cirillus libr. 4. cap. 17.
sed etiam morbos omnes depellit, sed at saeuiente^ membrorum legem, pietatem
corroborat, perturbationes animi extinguit, nec in quibus sumus peccatis
considerat, aegrotos curat, collisos redintegrat, abomni nos casu erigit. It
dryueth away not only death, but also al sycknes, it stylleth and pacifyeth the
ragynge law of our members, it strengthens devotion, it quenches the
froward affections of the mind, and those small sins we be in, it regards
not, it heals the sick, it restores the brussed, and from al falling it
lyfteth us up.

O what wonderful effects be these, which by this blessed Sacrament be
wroughte in ye worthy receauer, against the devil and his temptations, against
the flesh and her illusions against the viciouse affections of our corrupt
mind? What conscience had these men, our late teachers and pastors, destroyers
of Christ's flock, to rob us of this treasure, which is the cause of so
great benefytes, and in the place of that, to plant among us a bare
ceremonye of bread and wine to put us in remembrance of Christ in heaven (as
they said) which neither by their own nature, nor yet by any institution
either of God or man, be able to bring to pass in us these effects I have
spoken of? What meante they that took away this armoure of Christ's flesh and
blood from us, but to leave us naked and unarmed against the devil, that he
should prevail against us in all temptations, and that the kingdom of sin
should be erected, and the kingdom of grace destroyed? and to teach that this
blessed Sacrament is nothing else, but bread and wine, what is it else but to
take away this armoure and harness of Christ's flesh and blood from us: For
bread be it never so much appointed to signify things absente, is not able
to defend us from the devil. Well: one other effect I shall note unto you,
and make an end of that matter.

This effect is written in the next verse of the same Psalm. psalm. 22.
Et calix tuus inebrians quam praeclarus est: and thy chalice or cup that
makes us drunk, how goodly and excellent is it? There be two cups, one
worldly of wine, the other heavenly of Christ's blood: both make men dronken,
but after diverse sorts, the one is sometimes the instrument of sin, the
other at all times the instrumente of grace, forasmuch as perteyneth to his
own nature.

Of this writes Saint Cyprian. Sed quia ebrietas dominici calicis and
sanguinis non est talis, Cyprian libro. 2. epist. 3*
qualis est ebrietas uini secularis, cum diceret spiritus sanctus in Psalmo.
Calix tuus inebrians, addidit perquam optimus: quod scilicet calix dominicus
sic bibentes inebriat, ut sobrios faciat, ut mentes ad spiritalem sapientia^
redigat, ut a sopore isto seculari, ad intellectu^ Dei unus quisque resipiscat.
But because the dronkenes of our lords cup and blood is not such, as is
the dronkenes of worldly wine: when the holy ghost in the Psalm said. Thy
cup that makes men drunk, (he added) is very godly and excellent, because
the cup of our Lord does so make the drinkers drunk, yt it makes them
sobre, that it brings their minds to spiritual wisdom, that every man
may bring him self from this drowsines of the world to the understanding and
knowledge of God.

To this intent saint Ambrose writes in diverse places, Ambrose in Psalm, 1.
as upon the first Psalm. At uero Dominus Jesus aquam de petra effudit, and
omnes biberunt, and so forth, The place is long and for auoydinge of tediousnes
I shall faythfullye rehearse it in English. But our Lord Jesus brought water
out of the stone, and all drank of it. They that drank in figure, were
satiate, they that drunk in truth, were made drunk: ye dronkennes is good,
which brings in mirth and no confusion, that drunkenness is good, that
stays in sobrenes the motions of the mind.

And he speaks more play ner in these words. Ambrose in psa. 118 Ser. 15.
Eat the meat of the Apostles preaching before, that thou may afterward
come to the meat of Christ, to the meat of our Lords body, to the deynties
of the sacrament, to that cup wherwithall the affection of the faithful is
made drunk, that it might conceive gladness for remission of sin, and put
away the thoughts of this world, the fear of death, and all troublesome
carefulnes: for by this dronkennes ye body does not stumble and fall but rises
(to grace and glory) the soul is not confounded, but is consecrate and made
holy.

These scriptures and these effects brought out of the scriptures, and
confirmed by many manifest aucthorities of the holy fathers do prove
evidently to any man that has but common wit, and any sparkle of grace, and
is not forsaken of almighty god, that ye substance of this sacrament is
neither bread nor wine, but only the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ,
united to gods son in unity of person, which is a sufficient cause, able
to work in the worthy receauer these heavenly and gloriouse effects, which I
have spoken of already.

Whereby appears, what moves me to continue still in that faith, which is so
expressly taught in holy scripture: which scripture also draws and pulls
me from the contrary false opinion.

In diverse places it moves me and all christen men to beware and take heed of
false prophets* Mat. 7.
that come in the apparel of sheep, but within they be rauenouse wolfes: that
in their mouths have the word of god, the truth, the gospel, and such gaye
words, but the pit and effect of their teaching is old rotten heresies,
confuted and condemned of al Christendom before, and not Gods word, the name
whereof they abuse to ye mayntenaunce of all vice, error, beastlye living,
adultery, disobedience, sacrilege, and open conspiracye, to the subversion of
them selfs, and of that state under which they live.

The scripture cries, 1. Io. 4*
Nolite omni spiritui credere, believe not every spirit, but try and prove the
spirits, if they be of God or no, for many false Prophets are abroad in the
world. One way to try the^, is to mark the end of their conversation* and
the example and fruit of their lives, as S. Paul says: Heb. 13.
Quorum exitum conuersationis intuentes, eorum imitamini fidem: follow their
faith, the end of whose conversation ye have seen.

We have seen, what is the end of this new teaching, carnal and detestable
living, conspiracye and treason.

The other fathers of whom we learned our faith, were men whom the corrupt
world was not worthy to have: these authors of this new opinion were men
that were not worthy to have and enjoy the world: of whom saint Peter writes,
Magistri mendaces, 2. Pe. 2.
and so forth. Lying masters that bring in sects of perdicion, and deny that
Lord that bought the^ (as they do in this matter of the sacrament) bringyng
upon them a spedy perdition: and many shall follow their ways, through whom
the way of truth shall be sclaundered and blasphemed, and in covetousness by
feyned words they shall make marchaundise of you, to whom judgment ceasseth
not, and their destruction slepeth not.

We be also warned by S. John of this matter, ^. Io, 1
saying: he that remains and abides in the doctrine (that the Apostles
taught) he has the father and the son. If any come to you not bringing this
doctrine, do not receive him into your houses.

Here he does teach us to avoid them, that profess any other doctrine then
such, as al faithful men universally thoroughout the world have received and
profess, which is not the doctrine, that the Sacramentaries preach.

Finally considering the promises of Christ to his church, that he will be
with them too the worlds end, Mat. 28.
and that the holy ghost shall lead them into all truth, John. 16
then may we iustlye say, that if this our faith be an error, it has
prevailed universally not one hundredth year, but two, three, four, yea a
thousand year, and more then that, even to the ascensio^ of Christ, as
appears by the testimonies of all holy writers, and then may we say Lord if
we be deceived, thou have deceived us, we have believed thy word, we have
followed the tradition of the universal church, we have obeyed the
determinations and teachynges of those bishops and pastors, whom thou have
placed in the Church to stay us in unity of faith, that we be not carried
away with every wind of false doctrine. Therefore if we be deceived it comes
of thee O Lord, our error is invincible.

But good people, we are sure, God deceaueth no man, let us al beware we do not
deceive our selfs, as S. James says.

Thus having spoken somthinge of ye scriptures, as this short time would permit,
there remains also the second thing, which I said moved me to continue in
this faith, which is the aucthorities of ancient fathers, that have
flourished in the preaching of Gods truth in all ages with aucthorities. I
think verelye in no age have been so curiously sought, so diligently found
out, and so substantially wayed, as in this our time.

And all this is, because the oppugnation of the truth in this matter, has
extend it self not only to the scriptures but also to the doctors and to
every particle and title of the doctors, whose writings have been so scanned
and tried, that if any thing could have been gathered and piked out of their
books, either by liberal writing before this misterye came in contention, or
by misconstructio^ of their words, or by deprauation of their meaning, that
could seem too make against our faith herin, it was not omitted of some, but
stoutly alleged, amplified, enforced, and set forth to the utter most that
their wits could conceive, which if god has not infatuat, leaving them to
speak so, as neither faith nor reason could allow: like as they have with
their vanities seduced a great sort the more pitye, so they should have
undermined and subverted the faith of a great many mo, yt were doubting and
falling, but not clean ouetrhrowen, thanks be to almighty god.

Of these aucthorities, although with a little study and less labor, I could
at this time allege a great number: yet considering the shortness of the time,
which is almost spent, I shall be content to pick out a few* which do not
only declare the mind of the aucthor, but also conteyne an argument to prove
and convince ye truth of our faith, and such an argument, as neither
figurative speech nor deprauation of the words or meaning can delude. And
first I shall begin with the weakest, that is with the suspicion of the
gentyles. Tertullian in his apologye teaches, Tertul. apo. ca. 7.
how the gentiles did accuse the Christen men for killyng of young children,
and eating of their flesh, he says thus: Dicimur sceleratissimi de
Sacramento infanticidij and pabulo inde. We are reported and accused as most
mischeuouse and wicked men, for the sacrament of killinge of children, and
eating their flesh, and drynkyng their blood.

Eusebius also in his story of the church, writes of one Attalus a martyr,
Historia ecclesiast lib. 5. ca 3
who being roasted in an iron cradell with fire put underneath, when the
savor of his burnte flesh came to the smelling of the people that looked on:
he cried with a loud voice to the people. Lo, this is to eat men which you
do, which fault ye make inquisition of, as secretly done of us, which you
commit openly in the midde day.

By this accusation we may understand, that our Sacraments and mysteries in
the beginning of the church were kept very secret, both from the syghte and
knowledge of the paganes that mocked and skorned them, and also of those that
were Catechumeni, learners of our faith and not yet baptized, for many great
causes which I shall not need to rehearse now. And yet for all the secret
keeping of them, being so many Christen men and women as there was, they could
not be kept so secret, but that some ynkelynge of them came to ye ears of
those that were infidels and unchristened, insomuche that where as in deed and
very truth by the rules of our religion, we did eat the flesh of Jesus
Christ our Lord, and drink his blood ministered unto us in the sacrament, the
gentiles as they were curiouse to know new things, so they came to knowledge
of the rumoure of our doings, and either by the bewrayinge of some false
brethren, or else by ye simplicitye of other, that of zeal without knowledge
would have converted the unfaithful too our faith, heard secretlye, that we
Christen men in our mysteries did eat man's flesh and drink man's blood,
which they for lack of faith, and further instruction began to compass in
their wits, how it was possible so to do, and therefore some of them blinded
by their own foolyshe suspicion conceived and publyshed among other, as it
was most likely unto them, that we in our secret mysteries did kill young
children, eating their flesh, and drynkyng their blood, and thereupon accused
certain before the magistrates of this haynouse crime, which they could never
try out to be true, as they did accuse.

But for our purpose it appears plainly, that we would never have kept our
mysteries so secret, if they had been but ceremonies of eating of bread and
wine, nor they would never have accused us of such beastly and unnatural crimes
being men of such reason, learning, and equity, as they were, if there had
not been some truth in their accusation, which in deed was true for the
substance of that they alleged, but not for the manner of the thing: for it
was and is true, that we in our mysteries eat flesh and drynk blood, but yet
we do not kyl and murdre young children, and eat their flesh and drink
their blood. And therefore I allege the sayings of Tertullian and Eusebius,
the which is also in Origin the.6. book contra Celsum, to declare the
accusation of the gentiles against us, concerning the eating of flesh, and
drinking of blood, which could never have commed into their heads so too
have done, if there had not been a truth in that matter, which they by their
reason could never see otherwise, then they alleged, which we by our faith do
plainly see and know as it was ordained by Christ our Lord. And for that
cause Tertulliane did cast in a vayn word, saying: that we were accused of the
sacrament of kyllyng of children, which word (Sacrament) stands there for no
purpose, but to declare unto us, that this their accusation did rise for lack
of the true and precyse knowledge of our Sacrament, which is true, concerning
the eating of flesh and drinking of blood, but not true concerning the
killing and murderyng of children.

And yet afterward our mysteries as they came in more knowledge among the
gentiles, so they came into more contempt: for when the multitude of Christen
men were so increased, that they cared not who did look upon them in the time
of their mysteries, being out of fear of any external violence and
persecution: then the gentyles seeing them knock, and knele, and make adoration
to the Sacraments, not knowing them to be any thing else, but as their eyes,
senses, and reason did judge, that is to say, bread and wine, as our
Sacramentaries do now, being blinded now with heresye, as they before were
with infidelitye: then I say, they said, that we did not worship and adore
one God, as we pretended, but many gods, as they were accustomed: for they
said (as saint Augustyne writes) that we did worship Ceres and Bacchus,
August. con. faust lib. 20. cap. 13.
the gods of corn and wine, taking our Sacraments to be nothing else, but
bare bread and wine, as the Sacramentaries do and not to be Christ our Lord
and God, his flesh and his blood, as al true faithful men do, which appears
by the adoration of them: the which adoration we learn, yt it was done to the
Sacraments from the beginning, as is proved by the testimonies of our enemies
the gentiles, as S. A^gustyne reports: And also by their adoration we learn,
y^ the things whyeh they did adore, were not simple creatures, but Christ's
body and his blood, united to the second person in Trinity.

S. Basyll being asked, with what fear, persuasion, faith, Basilius in reg. in
terro 172
and affection we should come and communicate the body and blood of Christ,
answers thus: Concerning the fear, we have the saying of the Apostel, He
that eats and drynketh unworthily, eats and drynketh his judgment and
damnation.

What faith we should have, the words of our Lord do teach, who said: This
is my bo^y, which is given for you, do this in my remembrance. And Hesichius
says likewise: Sermo qui prolatus est in dominicum mysterium, Hesichius lib.
6. ca, 22.
ipse liberat nos ab ignora^tia, The words of Christ, which were spoken upon
our Lords mysterye, they deliver us from ignorance, that is to say, they
teach us, what faith, what estimation we should have of them. Now except they
be taken as they sound to every man, although he be unlearned and not
instructed in our faith before, they could not teach us, what faith we
should have, concerning the Sacraments, and therefore in that they be words,
whereupon we must learn our faith, which deliue^ us from ignorance, what ye
things be, that be delivered, for that cause they must be taken, as they
sound, that is to say, that the sacraments delivered be the very body and
blood of Christ, that gave them.

Chrysostom says: Quod sacerdos de manu sua dat, Chrysostom. hom. 17. in Matthew
non solum sanctificatum est, sed etiam sanctificatio est. That thing that the
priest does give out of his hand, is not only a thing sanctified, but it is
sanctification it self.

Therefore our Sacrament must not only be an holy thing as they said, holy
bread, and holy wine: but it must be the substance of holiness, making all
other things holy.

And here I think it worthy to be noted, and to be opened somewhat unto you,
with what sophistrye and unlearned folly they deluded the sa^ctification and
consecration of this Sacrament. Children at the university can tell, that it
is a deceytfull way of reasoning, by a general description to exclude and
drive away a special and singular definition, as they did in this case. For
they said, that the consecration of the sacrament was no more, but an
appoyntynge of bread and wine to an holy use, which use they said was to
signifye unto us Christ's body that is in heaven: and therefore some said, that
the bread was consecrate, when the paryshe clerk did bring it to the church,
and set it upon the table, and these were no small men, but our greatest
bishops, God forgive it them: other said it was not consecrate, till the words
of Christ were spoken, but yet they noted, that the Priest should not look at
the bread in the time of the pronouncyng, for this end be like, that they
should not be deceived, and that God should work no more, then it pleased
the^, that their doctrine might some way be true.

And therefore they said, every man and woman might consecrate and speak the
words as well as a priest: but they never read what Arnobius says: Arnobius
in Psalm. 139.
Quid tam magnificu^ quam Sacramenta diuina conficere? et quid tam perniciosum,
quam si ea is conficiat, qui nullum sacerdotij gradum accepit? what is so
excellent, then to consecrate the sacraments of God? and what is so pernicio
use, then if he do consecrate, that has received no order and degree of
priesthode? And as they erred in the time and person, so they erred in the
nature of the consecration, making this of the same sort that al other
co^secrations be, receauynge the general description, and denyinge the degrees
and specialties of sanctification, which be many: for some things be holy,
not for any holiness that is in them, but for that they be brought to the
church, and dedicate to some holy use, as is the temple of God, the vestures
about the aultare, and other things used in Gods service, which things too
steal and convey is sacrilege: and among those things there be degrees of
holiness, August. de peccat merit. and remiss lib 2. ca. 26.
as saint Augustyne says: Quod accipiunt Catechumeni, quamuis non sit corpus
Christi, sanctum est tamen, and sanctius quam cibi quibus alimur. Holy bread
which those that be learners receive, although it be not the body of Christ,
yet it is holy, and more holy then the meat, with which we are fed daily,
which also is sanctified by the word and prayer.

There is also holiness a quality, a virtue, and gift of God, making him in
whom it is, acceptable in the sight of god. The soul of man is likewise
sanctified and holy, because it is that substance and subject wherein holiness
consists and dwells, being a vessel created to gods image, and prepared to
receive gods gift of sa^ctification and holiness.

And the body of a godly man is also sanctified and holy, because it is the
membre of Christ, the temple of the holy ghost, and the house and tabernacle
of the soul, replenyshed with gods grace and sanctification, and for this
reason we have in reverence and estimation the relics and bodies of holy
martyrs and co^fessors, which being members of Christ, were also pleasinge
sacrifices to almighty god, either for austeritie of life, or for sufferynge
of undeserved death, for the faith or in the quarrel of Jesus Christ our
Lord.

The sacraments of Gods church be justly called holy, because they be the
instruments, whereby God does work holiness in the soul of man, and be as
causes of the same by Christ's own ordinance and institution. But above all
other this Sacrament of the aultare is holy, being as Chrysostom said, not
only a thing sanctified, but the very sanctification it self: for in that it
is the body of Christ by consecration, whereunto is annexed ye godheade by
unity of person, it must needs be holiness it self not in quality, but in
substance seeing whatsoever thing is in God, is also God, who for his
simplicity receaueth no qualitye into him self, but is the author and
principal cause of all good qualities and graces given to manne. Wherefore this
place of Chrysostom, that calls it sanctification it self* can not be
avoided by no figuratyue speeches, nor such like cauillations.

The same Chrysostom in his epistle to Innocentius Bishop of Rome writes
of the manner of the persecution in his time, Chrysostom. epist ad Innocentium.
not unlike to this of ours. Nam and sanctuarium ingressi sunt milites, quorum
aliquos scimus nullis initiatos mysterijs, and uiderunt omnia quae intus erant:
quin and sanctissimus Christi sa^guis (sicut in tali tumultu contingit) in
praedictorum militum uestes eflusus est, The soldiers came violentlye into the
holy place, of whom we know that some were not baptized, and there they saw
all things that were within, and the most holy blood of Christ (as chauncheth
often in such a tumult) was shed upon the garments of those soldiers.

Here I mark that he says not the figure or sign of christ's blood, but the
most holy blood, an other inferior creature can not be most holy. Also I
mark that this most holy blood was reserved there in the holy temple, and
was not only in heaven to be received by faith of the faithful, but also was
in the temple and violently handeled of the unfaithful, being there
contemned, abused, and spilt upon their garments. Does not this barbaricall
violence, and external situation of the most holy blood of Christ, prove a
real presence of the same in the Sacrament?

Gregorye Nazianzene speaks after the like manner, Nazianze. orat. ad Arianos*
how that the Arianes would not suffer the Catholics to pray in their
temples, but troubled them, and killed the^, and mingled Christ's mystical
blood, with the blood of the catholic priests, which they slew, and so
forth: whereby we understand a real presence of Christ's blood by that
violence, that was showed unto it of the heretics part, though Christ were
there after that sort, that he could suffer no violence of his part.

We read in saint Hyerome and in diverse other: Hieronimus ad hedibiam.
Ipse conuiua and conuiuium, comedens et qui comeditur: that Christ is both
the eater of the feast, and the feast it self, both the eater and the meat
that is eaten. Whereby we understand, that Christ gyuyng his body and his
blood to his discyples, did receive the same him self before.

And as Chrysostom writes, that lest his disciples should have been troubled
and offended, Chrysostom. in Matthew hom. 83.
hearing him say, This is my blood, Euthymius in Mat cap. 64.
drink ye all of this, as ye Caparnaites were before* and so should abhor to
have droncke of the same. Christ did first drink of the same cup before
them, that he might by his example induce his disciples to drink likewise.

And Hesichius says: Hesichius in Leuit. lib. 2 ca. 8
Ipse dominus primus in coena mystica intelligibilem accepit sanguine^, atque
deinde calicem Apostolis dedit: Our Lord him self in the mistical supper,
first drank his own blood, that was not seen, but understood, and then gave
the cup to his Apostels.

By this fact of Christ we may learn, that in the cup was verily and
reallye Christ's own blood: for if christ did eat his body, and drank his
blood but in figure, then he did eat and drink it before after that manner in
the typical and legal supper, and then how can this mystical supper be the
truth, and the other the figure, if this be but a figure likewise? And then
why should the Apostle be affrayed to do that now, they were wont to do always
before. It was no new thing, worthy the new Testamente, to eat and drink
Christ in a figure: and therefore it is certain, that Christ in his mystical
supper did not eat and drink his body and blood only fyguratiuely. And if
ye will say, that he eat it and drank it spiritually only, then ye must
say, that Christ did eat it by faith, for spiritual eating is beleuyng. And
if ye say, Christ did believe, then it follows yt Christ was not God. Who has
perfyte knowledge of all things by syghte, and not imperfect knowledge by
faith, as we have, seeing as through a glass in a dark rydle. And surely they
harp much upon this string: for this heresy against the presence of Christ in
the sacrament, is an high way, leadyng to the other heresy, that Christ is not
God, as is proved by diverse ways and arguments, into which pit diverse be
falling by this means, if God do not put under his hand to stay them
betimes: for if they continue long in this, they will fall into the other, no
remedy, whereof we have already seen experience.

Then if Christ did eat his body, and drink his blood in the mystical
supper, neither figuratively, as he did in the paschall lamb nor yet
spirituallye as we do by faith: then it is certain, that he eat it only
sacramentally, which is not only in sign (as the sacramentaryes expound the
word) but in truth under a sacrament, whereof the substance is the real and
natural body and blood of Christ our lord.

After this sort writes Chrysostom of David, saying thus: Non contigit
David gustare talem hostiam, neque particeps fuerat sanguinis dominici, sed
legibus imperfectioribus educatus, neque tale quicquam exigentibus: tamen ad
euangelicae philosophiae fastigium peruenit animi moderatione. It never
chanced to David to taste of such a sacrifice, nor he was not receauer and
pertaker of our Lords blood, but being brought up under laws not so
perfect, and requiringe no such thing, yet by the moderation and te^peraunce
of his own mind he came to the hight of all evangelical diuinitye.

Here is plain, that David did never taste and receive Christ's blood,
Chrysostom. hom. de David (...) Saul.
as we do in the gospel, and yet David did receive Christ's blood
figuratively, being partaker of the sacrifices of the old law, which were
figures of christ's blood and also he did drink of the same blood spirituallye
as we do, whose faith was as good or rather greater then ours. Therefore there
remains one other way that we drink of it, which was not granted unto him,
that is to say, verily and really in the sacrament.

To avoid this place well, they must have moo solutions then they have
invented yet, for neither figuratiuelye nor spirituallye will serve, it were
best for them to yield to the truth, and confess that it is there really,
the very same substance of his blood, yt was shed upon the cross, though
not in that form, for the relief of our weak nature, which else could not
sustain it.

And further then this S. Augustyne says: Si dixerimus Catechumeno, credis in
Christo? August, in Ioann^ tract. 11
respondit, credo, et signat se cruce Christi, portat in front, and non
erubescit de cruce domini sui: ecce credit in nomine eius. Interrogemus eum,
manducas carnem filij hominis, and bibis sanguinem filij hominis? nescit quid
dicimus, quia lesus non se credidit ei. If we shall say to one ye learneth and
professes our faith, being yet not baptized: doeste thou believe in Christ? he
answers, I believe, and he does sign him self with the cross of Christ,
he bears it in his forheade, and is not ashamed of the cross of his Lord:
Loo be believes in his name. But let us ask him, doeste thou eat the flesh
of the son of man, and drink the blood of the son of man? he can not tell
what we say, for Jesus has not believed and committed him self to him.
Beside other things that may be fruytfully gathered of this place for our
erudition, I note but this one, that a man beleuyng in Christ, professing the
faith of Christ with his word and work, and for that cause eats Christ's
flesh and drinks his blood spirituallye, yet he wot not what the eating of
Christ's flesh means, whereof Christ spoke in the.6. of saint John. But we
that be baptized, and are admitted to our Lords table: we know by our
experience, what it is to eat Christ's flesh and to drink his blood, for to
us Christ does trust and give him self, to the other that believe as well as
we, he does not commit him self.

Whereby I conclude beside the spiritual eating of Christ by faith, there is
also a real eating of him in ye sacrament, by the service of our bodies, to
the confirmation in grace, and sanctification both of our bodies and souls.

And concerning the drinkyng of Christ's blood reallye* S. Cyprian writes an
other argument, Cyprian. Ser. de coena.
which I think can not be avoided by any figurative speeches, he says
thus: Noua est huius Sacramenti doctrina, and scholae euangelicae hoc primum
magisterium protulerunt, and doctore christo primum haec mundo innotuit
disciplina, ut biberent sanguinem Christiani, cuius esum legis antiquae
authoritas districtissime interdicit. Lex quippe esum sanguinis prohibet,
Euangelium praecipit ut bibatur. etc. Origin also writes this same thing very
plainly upon Numeri. Origin in Numeros hom. 16
hom. 16. The English is this of Cyprian. The doctrine of this Sacrament is
new, and the evangelical school, taught this lesson first of all, this
discipline was never known to the world before our master Christ, who was
the first teacher of it, that Christen men should drink blood, the eating
of which blood the aucthority of the old law does most strayghtly
forbid: for the law forbids the eating of blood, the gospel commands
blood to be dronken. etc.

Now this is most certain, that the law did never forbid the drinking of
Christ's blood figuratively, but did command drink offeringes, which were
figures of this blood, and the Jews drank of the water that came forth of the
stone, which was a figure of the blood that came forth of Christ's side,
which blood as Chrysostom says, is in our chalyce: Chrysostom, ^n. 1. Cor. hom.
24.
Id est in calice quod fluxit e latere, and illius no^ sumus participes: ye
same thing is in the chalyce, that slowed out of Christ's side, and we are
partakers of the same. Nor the law did never forbid the drynking of christ's
blood spyrytuallye by faith, but set forth the faith of Christ, being a
scholemayster, to Christ poyntynge, to him, in whom they should believe and
receive all grace.

But to make short, the law forbadde the external and real drynkyng of
blood, which the gospel commands saying: except ye eat the flesh of
the son of man, John. 6.
and drink his blood, ye shall not have life in you, and drink ye all of
this, This is my blood of the new Testament. Therefore it follows
necessarelye, that the drynkyng of this blood is not figuratively, nor yet
only spirituallye, but reallye by the service of our bodies* as Chrysostom
says Si uiderit inimicus non postibus impositum sanguinem typi, Chrysostom. ad
Neophitos.
sed fidelium ore lucentem sanguinem ueritatis Christi templi postibus
dedicatum, multo magis se subtra hit. If our enemy the devil shall see not
the blood of the figurative lamb sprynkled upon the posts, but the blood of
Christ, the truth shynynge in the mouth of the faithful, much more he will
run away. There is a place of the proverbs, Proverb. ^3.
which as diverse authors do expound, makes much for the real presence of
Christ's body and blood in the Sacrament: the place is this after the greek,
which these authors followed. Cum sederis ad mensam potentis, sapienter
intellige quae apponuntur, and mitte manum tuam, sciens quia talia te oportet
praeparare When thou sytteste at the table of a great man, understand wisely
what things are set before thee, and put to thy hand, knowing that thou
must prepare such like things again. August. in ^oan. tract. 47 48. Chrysostom,
in Psalm* 23.
S. Augustyne upon saint John, and Chrysostom upon the Psalm, and Hesichius,
and other moo, whose words it were to long to rehearse in Latyne: Hesichius
lib. 6. ca, 22.
do expound this place of the proverbs thus. Who is this great man but Jesus
Christ our lord gods son? and what is the table of this great man, but where
is received his body and his blood that has given his life for us? And what
is to sytte at that table, but to come to it humbly and devoutly? and what is
to considre and understand wisely, what things be set before thee, but to
discern the body and blood of Christ to be set there verelye in truth, and
to know the grace, virtue, and dignity of the^, and the danger for the
misusyng of them? and what is to put to thy hand, knowing that thou must
prepare such like again, but to eat of them, knowing that christen men in
the cause of Christ, and defense of the truth are bounden to shed their
blood, and spend their lives for their brethren, as christ has done the same
for us before, that like as we have received at Christ's table his body and
his blood, so ought we to give for our brethren our bodies and blood.

This comparyson of taking and giving the like again, auoydeth all the
trifling cauillations of these figurative speeches, that the simple peoples
heads be combred wythal. Here is no place for eating only by faith, for the
martyrs did not only believe in Christ, but also in very deed gave their bodies
and shed their blood really for Christ.

I need not stand longer in so plain a matter, although I could allege much
more out of all the ancient fathers, yea and more playner then these I have
touched, if any can be playner. If I did but tell the bare names of the
Sacrament, which the authors give it: I should prove manifestlye, that it were
the very body and blood of Christ, and not bread and wine. Ignatius calls
it Medicamentum immortacitatis, antidotum non moriendi, Ignatius ad Ephe^sios.
a medicine of immortalitye, a preservative against death. Dionisius
Ariopagita S. Paul's scholar calls it hostia salutaris, Dionisiu^ Hier.
eccle. cap. ^
the sacrifice of our salvation. Justinius martyr says, Justinius Apolo.
it is caro and sanguis incarnati Jesus, the flesh and blood of Jesus
incarnate, which names be given to it of the scripture and all other writers.
Origin calls it Panis uitae, dapes saluatoris, Origin in Luc. hom 38. in Mat
hom. 5.
epulum incorruptum. Dominus, the bread of life, the deynties of our
savior, the meat that is never corrupted, yea our Lord him self. Cyprian
calls it Sanctu^ domini, Cyprianus de lapsis de coena.
the holy one of God, gratia salutaris, the saving grace, Cibus
inconsumptibilis, the meat that can never be consumed, Alimonia
immortalitatis, the food of immortalitye, Portio uitae aeternae, the portion
of eternal life, Sacrificium perpes, holocaustum permanens, a continual
sacrifice, an offering always remaining, Christus yea he calls it Christ
The great general counsel at Nice calls it Agnus Dei qui tollit ^eccatum
mundi, Conciliu^ Nicenum
the lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world.

Optatus an old author gives it diverse names, Optatus lib, 6.
as in this sentence. Quid tam sacrilegu^ quam altaria Dei frangere, radere,
remouere, in quibus uota populi and membra Christi portata sunt, unde a multis
pignus salutis aeternae tutela fidei, and spes resurrectionis accepta est? What
is more sacrilege, then to break the aultares of God (as the Donati^tes did)
or to scrape them, or to remove them, upon the which aultares the vows of the
people, yt is to say, the members of Christ are borne, from which aultares
also the pledge of eternal salvation, the defense and buckeler of faith, and
the hope of resurrection be received.

Hilarious calls it cibus dominicus, our Lords meat, uerbum caro, Hilarious.
lib. 8.
the word made flesh. S. Basyll in his Mass calls them sancta, Basilius in
Missa,
diuina, impolluta, immortalia, supercelestia, and uiuifica sacramenta. Holy
Sacraments, godly, pure, undefiled, immortal, heavenly, and gyuyng life. What
wyttelesse and ungodly man would give these names to bread and wine? S.
Ambrose calls it gratia dei, Ambrosius de obitu fratris
the grace of God, not an accidental grace received of God into man's soul, but
the very real Sacrament he calls the grace of God, the which his brother
Satyrus being upon the sea, and his ship broken, sekyng for none other aid
but only the remedy of faith, and the defense of that Sacrament, took this
grace of God of the priests, and caused it to be bound in a stole, which he
tied about his neck, and so trusting in that, committed him self to the
waters, by virtue whereof he escaped drownyng, and afterward of a catholic
Bishop he received that same grace of God with his mouth.

Chrysostom O with what eloquence does he utter this matter: hear but this
one place. Chrysostom. 1, Cor. 10.
Ipsa namque mensa animae nostrae uis est, nerui mentis, fiduciae uinculum,
fundamentum, spes, salus, lux, uita nostra. The very table says he (meaning
the meat of the table) is the strength of our soul, the synewes of our
mind, the knotte of our trust, the foundation, our hope, our health, our
light, and our life. What names, what effects be these? and in an other
Homelye he calls it Rex coeli, Ad Ephe. Ser. 3.
Deus, Christus, The king of heaven, God him self, Christ, which he says
goes into us, by these gates and doors of our mouths. Cyrillus calls it
sanctificatio uiuifica, Cirillus libr. 4. cap. 17.
The very sanctification that gives life. And S. Augustyne calls it Praetium
nostrum, August. epist. 163
The price of our redemption, which Judas received. What should I trouble you
any longer in so plain a matter? Why should these holy fathers deceive us by
calling this Sacrament with so gloriouse and high names, if they meante not
so, but that it was but bread and wine? they lacked no grace that had so much
grace as to shed their blood for christ's faith, they lacked no wit nor
eloquence to express what they meant. Thus did they wi^h one consent, after
one manner always speak and write, by whose plain preaching and wrytinge,
the whole world of Christendom has been persuaded and establyshed in this
faith of the real presence these fiftene hundredth years.

If they have seduced us meaning otherwise then they wrote, then may we justly
say, that they were not martirs and confessors in deed, but very deuyls,
errynge them selves, and bringynge other also in error.

But good people the truth is, they erred not, but taught us as they believed
the very truth, confirmyng and testifyinge that faith which their blood yt
they had taught with their mouth. And if there be any error, it is in us,
that for the unlearned talkinge, and wytlesse sophistical reasonyng of a few
men, will headlinges destroy our souls: forsaking and not continuing in that
faith, which was taught by the mouth of christ* sealed with his blood,
testified by the blood of martyrs, and has prevailed from the beginning,
against the which hell gates can not prevail. Now there remains some thing
to be said, concerning the third part which is the consent of ye catholyke
church in this point: but I am sorry, the time is so past, that I can not now
say any thing of it, in my next day god willinge I shall touch it, and also
proceed in the matter of the sacrifice, which I hope to god to make so plain,
yt it shall appear to the^ yt will see and be not blinded forsaken of god, to
be a thing most evident most profitable to be used and freque^ted in christ's
church, and that such sclaunders and blasphemies as be shot against it, shall
rebound (I hope) upon their onwe heads, that shot them to the glory of
almightye GOD, who by his heavenly providence can so dyspose the malice of a
few, that it turn to the stay and commoditye of the whole, that the elect
by such conflictes may be awaked from their sleep, may be more confirmed in
all truth, and may be more vigilant and ware in learning and observing the
law of God, to whom be all glory and praise world without end.

Amen.
The second Sermon.
Roma. 12. Obsecro uos fratres per misericordiam Dei, ut exhibeatis corpora
uestra hostiam sanctam, etc.


Among other things ye last time I was admitted to speak in this place I
brought forth this sentence of S. Bernarde written in a sermon de Epiphania,
Bernar. Ser. 1. de Epiph.
Pauperes sumus, paru^ dare possumus. etc. The English is this. We be poor,
little may we give, yet for that little we may be reconciled if we will. All that ever I am able to give is this wretched body of mine, if I give that, it
is sufficient: if not then I add his body, for that is mine and of mine own:
for a little one is borne unto us* and the son is given to us. O Lord that
lacks in me, I supplye in thee, O most swetest reconciliation.

Here I noted a great benefit of the oblation of Christ's body, to consiste in
supplyinge that lacks in the oblation of our bodies: that whereas we be
exhorted of saint Paul to offer up our bodies a sacrifice to almightye God,
and also do understand by other scriptures, that it is our duties so to do:
which may be done three ways: By voluntarye sufferynge the death for
Christ's faith, if case so require, by paynefull and penal works, as by
abstinence and other corporal exercises, for the castigation and mortifyinge
of the outward manne, or else by the service of righteousness, in that we use
the members and parts of our body, as instruments of all virtue and
godliness, co^siderynge again how there is great imperfection in all our
works, and that the best of us all comes short of that mark, which is
prefixed of God to serve him with al our heart, with all our strength, and that
either in the work it self or in thintente, or in the cause or time, or in
some other degree and circumstaunce: for this cause and consideration saint
Bernarde does him self and moves us to join the oblation of Christ's body
with ours, wherewithal we are sure god is well pleased, saying: This is my
son, Mat. 17.
in whom I am well pleased, by whose merits our oblation and other works do
please God, and not otherwise.

And therefore I purposed to make one sermon of the sacrifice of Christ, not of
y^ which he him self made upon the cross for our redemption, but of that
which the church his spouse makes upon the aultare, which purpose being also
before promised remains now to be fulfilled.

And entering the last time to speak of it, I ^ayde this foundation, that is
to say, the veritye of the blessed Sacrament, the body and blood of our
savior Christ to be verelye and really present in it by the omnipotent power
of almightye God, and the operation of his holy spirit assistynge the due
administration of the priest, and so to be there not only as our meat, which
God gives unto us to nouryshe us in spiritual life, but also as our
sacrifice, which we give and offer unto God to please him, and purge us from
such things, as may destroy or hinder that spiritual life, seeing that
Christ him self is the substance of the sacrifice of the new Testamente, as
I have partly showed before, and beside him we have none, that is only propre
to us Christen men.

This foundation of the real presence I presupposed to have been believed of us
all, and yet I did not so rawlye leave it, but declared unto you such reasons,
as moved me to continue still in that faith I was borne in, which were the
evident and plain scriptures of God, opened with the circumstaunces of the
places in such wise, as the vain cauillations of the Sacramentaries can not
delude them, and also the effects of this Sacrament, which be so great and so
wonderful, that they can be asscribed to no other cause, but only to almighty
God, and to such creatures, as gods son has joined unto him in unity of
person, as be the body and blood of our savior Christ.

I alleged also the sayings of the holy fathers, not in such number as I would
have done, but choosed out a few, which not only declared the authors faith,
but contained a necessary argument to prove our conmon faith in this matter.
Concerning the third point, which is the consent of the catholic church,
neither the time then suffered to speak as behooved, nor yet suffers now, if
I should perform my promise, as I intend GOD wylling. And for that cause I
shall but move you to consydre certain things, whereby the consent may appear.

First the possession of the church in this doctrine so many years in such
quietness without contradiction, that no reason, nor yet iniunction, nor no
new device that the devil or his dearlynges can invent to the contrary,
either can or ought to remove us out of possession, except we will wylfullye
loose our own right and claim, seeing that we that live now universally
throughout all Christendom have received this faith of our fathers, and they
of theirs, and so forth even to the Apostels and our savior Christ him
self, by whose mouth this doctrine (as S. Cyprian says) was first taught to
the world, Cyprian. Ser. de coena.
that Christen men in the new law be commanded to drink blood, which the
Jews in the old law were forbid to do.

And so from him and his Apostels it has been by succession deduced and
brought throughout all ages, even to this our time, and believed as Gods word,
which can not be changed, and not as man's word, subject to alteration, as
probabilitye can persuade.

Secondlye this consent in this matter may aypeare by that the holy fathers
and pastors of Christ's Church have written of it, whom God has placed and
planted in his church for the buylding and vpholdyng of it in truth, that his
flock be not seduced and carried about with every blaste of new doctrine by
the craftines of men, to the destruction of their souls. Of this I have spoken
somethyng already.

Thirdly we may know the consent of the church by the determination of the
general councels, where the presidentes of Gods churches, and the rulers and
learned priests of christendom, assembled in the name of our lord Jesus
christ, representyng the holy church of God militaunt, being led not with
private affection, but by Gods holy spirit to his glory, instant in prayer,
fervent in devotion, purely, diligently, and freely have entreated and
determined those things, that perteyne to ye faith of Christ, and the purging
of his church, to whose determination as to Gods ordinances we are bound
to obey. Wherein appears manifestlye the consent of the church.

The first general council both for the calling, and also for the cause, was
holden at Nice in Bithinia, by.318. bisshops in the time of Constantinus
Magnus, twelve hundredth and thirtye years agoo, Conciliu^ Nicenum
where it was determined and publyshed to y^ world in these words. Exal
altata mente fide consideremus situm esse in sancta illa mensa agnum Dei qui
tollit peccatum mundi, qui a sacerdotibus sacrificatur sine cruoris effusione,
et nos uere preciosum illius corpus and sanguinem sumentes credere haec esse
resurrectionis nostrae symbola. etc* Let us lift up our minds, understanding
and considering by faith, that the lamb of God which takes away the sins
of the world is situate and lies upon that holy table, which is offered of
the priests without the sheddyng of blood, and that we receauynge verelye
his preciouse body and blood, do believe them to be the pledges or causes of
our resurrection.

This aucthoritye serves me very well to declare the consent of the church
both in the matter of the real presence, and also of the sacrifice, which we
have in hand. For the words be couched meruelouslye, every one seruyng to
express the truth, and to avoid all doubts.

For first he byddeth us, lift up our minds, and considre by faith, willing
us not to stycke only to our senses, thinkyng nothing else to be there, but that
we see outwardlye, teaching us that the judgment of this matter perteyneth
not to our senses, but to our faith only, and as Eusebius Emesenus says,
Emesenus orat. de corpore Christi
Vere unica and perfecta hostia fide aestimanda no^ specie nec exterioris
ce^senda est uisu hominis, sed interioris affectu. This host and sacrifice is
verily one and perfect, to be esteemed by faith, and not by form and
apperaunce, to be judged not by the syghte of the outward man, but with ye
affection and persuasion of the inward man: for to faith only and not to senses
perteyneth the knowledge and judgment of Gods mysteries and sacraments.

Then the council declares what faith teaches, that is to say, that the
lamb of GOD, not material bread and wine, nor the figure of the la^be, but
the lamb that takes away the sin of the world, is placed lying upon the
holy table of the altar, which external situation proves a real presence
of Christ to be there before we receive it, and not a fantastical or an
intellectual receauyng of Christ by faith in the time of the receauinge only,
as these men contend.

Further it teaches, that this lamb of God is offered to almightye God by the
priests, which is a distinct offering from that Christ made upon the
cross, for there he offered him self by sheddyng his blood, which he did
but ones, and never shall do it again any more.

Here is he offered of the priests, not by sheddynge of blood, but as the
council says (...) not after a bloody manner, which is not a new killing of
Christ, but a solemn representation of his death, as him self has
ordained.

After this it declares the receiving of it saying, that we verelye receive
his preciouse body and blood, which word (verelye) is as much as that we call
(reallye) and declares the use of the sacrament in the receypte of it with the
service of our mouth, as Christ commanded saying: Take, eat, which is a
corporal eatinge, Mat. 19.
not a spiritual beleuyng.

And last of al it shows the effect of the sacrament, which is the
resurrection of our bodies to eternal life, for because Christ's body being
the body of very life, is joined to our bodies as our food: it brings our
bodies that be dead by sentence of death to his propertye which is life,
whereof in my last sermon I spoke more at large.

O Lord what hard hearts have these men to doubt the^ selfs, or to deny, or
to bring in question that manifest open truth in so high and necessary a
matter, which in most plain words has been taught of our savior
Christ, his Apostels and evangelists, and declared so to be understand by the
holy ghost out of the mouths of all these holy fathers, whom the holy
ghost did assemble and inspire with the spirit of truth to the confusion of
the great heretyke Arius, that troubled the world then, and also did inspire
their hearts to declare so plainly the mystery of this blessed sacrament,
which then was without al contention, believed of all Christen men, only to
preuente these heretics ye arise and spring up now in these latter days,
that the world may see, how they strive against the known truth, their
own conscience, and the determination of the whole church, being enemies of
God, breakyng his peace, and dividing them selfs from the church, whose end
is eternal confusion.

Likewise the next general council holden at Ephesus, in the time of
Theodosius the Emperor, eleven hundredth and twentye years agoo, does
determine this truth likewise in these words. Council Ephesi. epi ad Nestorium
Necessario igitur and hoc adijcimus. Annunciantes enim sicut secundum carne^
mortem unigeniti filij Dei, id est, Jesus Christi and resurrrectionem cius, and
in coelis ascensionem pariter confitentes, incruentum ce lebramus in Ecclesijs
sacrificij cultum, sic etiam ad mysticas benedictiones accedimus, and
sanctificamur participes sancti corporis et preciosi sanguinis Christi omnium
nostrum redemptoris effecti, non ut commune^ carnem percipientes (quod absit),
nec ut uiri sanctificati and uerbo coniuncti secundum dignitatis unitatem, aut
sicut diuinam possidentis habitationem, sed uere uiuificatricem and ipsius
uerbi propriam facta^. We add this also necessarely: We showing and
declarynge the corporal death of Gods only begotten son Jesus Christ, and
likewise confessing his resurrection and ascension unto heaven do celebrate the
unbloody oblatio^ and sacrifice in our churches, for so we come to the
mystical benedictions, and are sanctified being made partakers of the holy
body and preciouse blood of Christ, all our redemer not receauyng it as common
flesh (God forbid) nor as the flesh of an holy man, and joined to the word
of God by unity of dignitye, nor as the flesh of him in whom God dwells,
but as the flesh only propre to gods son and verily giving life to the
receauer.

By this determination of this general counsel we learn, that in the mystical
benediction (by which word is meant this blessed Sacrament) we receive
Christ's own propre flesh, and of it we receive sanctification and life,
before the receypt whereof we celebrate the vnbloudye sacrifice of the same in
our churches, declaring our Lords death, resurrection, and ascension, and by
this place we plainly perceive that the doings and words which be used daily
in our Mass, were also used in the time of this council much above a
thousand years agoo.

This doctrine also was determined in the general council holden at
Constantinople in the time of Iustyniane ye Emperor, Conciliu^ co^stanti. in
trullo cap. 102*
the year of our Lord 552. where be written these words. Omni sensibili
creaturae supereminet is qui salutari passione, coelestem nactus digni tatem,
edens and bibens Christu^, ad uitam aeternam perpetuo co^iungitur, and anima
and corpore diuinae participatione gratiae sa^ctificatur. and so forth.

He far excels every sensible creature, that by the passion of our
savior obteynyng heavenly dignity, eating and drynkyng Christ, is
continually joined to eternal life, and is sanctified both in soul and body
by participation of the heavenly grace.

This place is notable, declarynge the dignity of him that eats Christ, and
the effect of that eating to be everlasting life and sanctification, both
of body and soul.

Likewise the general counsel called Lateranense, Conciliu^ Lateranense
holden at Rome the year of our Lord 1215. determined this matter in the same
terms, that we express it now. Vna est fidelium uniuersalis Ecclesia, extra
quam nullus omnino saluatur, in qua idem ipse sacerdos and sacrificium Jesus
Christus, cuius corpus and sanguis in Sacramento altaris sub speciebus panis
and uini ueraciter continentur, tran substantiatis pane in corpus, and uino in
sanguinem potestate diuina. There is one universal church of all faithful
people, without the which no man is saved at any time, in the which Jesus
Christ him self is both the priest and the sacrifice, whose body and blood
be truly contained in the sacrament of the aultare under the form of bread
and wine, the bread being transubstantiate into his body, and the wine into
his blood by the power of God.

This form of doctrine after this sort, and in these terms has been taught,
professed, and believed throughoute ye whole catholic Church ever sense that
time, howsoever some he retikes forsaking their faith, procedynge from Gods
omnipotent word and the unity of his church, and leaning to their
sensualitye and blind reason against faith have repyned and barked against the
same. But I put no doubts but by Gods grace, if the time would suffer me* to
make this matter o^ transubstantiation as plain as the other of the real
presence.

The general council also of Constance, Conciliu^ co^stantiense.
holden of latter days, the year of our Lord, 1415. does agree and testifye
the same, in that they condemned John Wyclefe the heretic and all his errors
against this blessed Sacrament.

Thus have I showed you the consent of the church by the determinations of
the general councels. It shall not be nedeful to rehearse any particular and
prouincial councels, which al in this doctrine agree with the other general.

Furthermore the consent of the church appears by ye condemnation of the
heretykes of al ages, which hold any false opinion in any point against the
veritye and the institution of Christ, concerning this blessed Sacrament.

The first heretic that ever we read of in this matter, and father to all the
Sacramentaries that live now, was one in the time of Ignatius by and by after
ye Apostels, whose name we know not, but what he and his sect that followed him
did Theodoretus in his third dialoge makes mention, Theodoretus. dialogo. 3
Ignatius ad Smyrnenses.
saying that Ignatius (who lived within one hundredth year of Christ (writes
in an epistle ad Smyrnenses in these words. Eucharistias and oblationes non
admittunt, eoque non confiteantur Eucharistiam esse carnem seruatoris nostri
Jesus Christi, quae pro pec^atis nostris passa est, and quam pater sua
benignitate suscitauit.

They do not allow and admit our Sacrament and offerynges, because they do
not confess the Sacrament (called Eucharistia) to be the flesh of our
savior Jesus Christ, which flesh suffered for our sins, and which the
fathers goodness did raise from death again.

By this we learn, what was the faith in the primitive church, both that the
Sacrament was the very flesh of Christ, which suffered for us, and also that
it was offered for us by the priests, which things those heretykes denied
then, as their scholars now springing up upon their ashes deny now, and that
they were condemned as heretykes by the primitive church then, as these most
worthily be condemned by the catholic Church now.

And where as the due matter, wherein this blessed Sacrament is consecrated,
ought to be unleavened bread, of wheat and wine myxed with water, according
to the scriptures and the example of christ: there were one sort of heretykes
called Artotoritae, (of whom speaks Epiphanius contra Quintillianos) which
were so called for y^ they used not in their sacrifyces the necessary and due
matter, Epiphanius contra Quintillianos.
but in their mysteries did consecrate, and offer bread and cheese.

An other sort of heretics were called Fermentarij, because they did
consecrate in leuened bread, as our men of late did command to be done* who
were condemned by the general council at Basyll. Conciliu^ Basiliense


Other were called Aquarij or Hydroparastae, for that they prete^dyng sobrietye
did consecrate in water only without wine, against whom writ saint Cypriane,
Cyprian libro. 2. epist. 3. Chrysostom. in Matthew hom. 83.
Chrysostom, and other, who also were condemned by the general council of
Constantinople in trullo. cap. 32.

Other were called Armenij who in their sacrifices consecrated and offered wine
only without water, against whom writes Theophilactus. All these held
false opinion against the necessary and due matter of the Sacrament.
Theophilactus in Ioa^. ca. 19
There were other heretykes, that denied the effect of the Sacrament, as
Messaliani, who (as it is written by Theodoretus) said that the heavenly food
whereof our lord spoke, Historia triparti^ lib. 7. cap 11.
he that eateh my flesh and drynketh my blood, shall live ever more, did
neither profit nor hurt any man.

Nestorius also the pernicious herytyke and Archebyshoppe of Constantinople
destroyed the virtue of the sacrament, (as Theophilactus writes) for yt he
granting christ's very flesh to be really and truly present in the
Sacrament, Theophilactus. ca. 10. ad Hebreos.
denied that flesh being received in to our bodies, to be the propre flesh
of gods son, and therefore to have no virtue to give life to our mortal
bodies: and this heresy was condemned by the generalcouncel, holden at Ephesus.

And where as this sacrament can not be consecrate but by a priest, there was
an heretic called Zacheus, condemned, (as Epiphanius writes) because he would
pray with no man, Epiphanius anacephaleosi.
but alone, and therefore without reverence and authority did handle the holy
mysteries and being a lay man, did impudently order and use them.

Also certain heretics called Anthropomorphitae denied the reservation of the
sacrament saying that Christ's body remained there no longer then it was in
receauyng, of whom Cyrillus writes thus.

Dicunt mysticam benedictione^ si ex e a remanserint in sequentem diem
reliquiae ad sanctificationem inutilem esse: Cyrillus ad Calosyrium.
sed in saniunt haec dicentes, non enim mutatur Christus, neque sanctu^ eius
corpus discedit, sed benedictionis uirtus, et uiuifica gratia continuo manet in
illis.

They say that the mystical benediction (which is the sacrament) is not
profitable to the sanctification of the receauer, if there remain any thing
of the sacrament to the next day. But they be stark mad that say so, for
Christ is not changed, nor yet his holy body does not depart away, but the
virtue of the benediction, and the grace of giuyng life, do continually abide
and remain in that that leaves.

This heresy is new revived again by Martyn Luther and his sect, but it can
not stand, being condemned of old time, and now also by the catholic
church.

Many moo heresies there be condemned, concerning the sacrament, beside the
heresye of Berengarius that twyse did recant it in two prouincial councels, and
at his death took great penance for his damnable opinion as the stories tell:
and also beside the condemnation of John Wycleffe in ye general council at
Constance, but I will not hyndre my purpose with a long rehersall of them.

These be sufficient to show the consent of the church by the condemnation of
heretykes, he that would know mo arguments to prove the consent in this or any
other matter, let him read a book called Vincentius Lirinensis contra
prophanas haeresum nouitates, he may bye it for less then six pence, and find
there a great treasure of good learning. Now to our purpose of the sacrifice.

Here thye prayer was made. Against the blessed Mass which is the sacrifice
of y^ church many words of many men have been said, but sufficient reprofe
of it has not yet been heard.

Scripture never one was yet alleged against it, saving one out of the epistle
to the Hebrews, where S. Paul writes, Heb. 9.
that Christ entered into heaven by his own blood ones, and afterward he
says: Christ was ones offered up to take away the sins of many: and all the
argument consists in this word (ones), which I shall (God willinge)
discuss hereafter.

But in very deed that same scripture that they bring against the Mass to no
purpose, is the very foundation of the Mass, whereupon the Mass is builded
and establyshed, after what sort I shall declare as time will serve.

Like as there is one God the father, Ephe. 4.
one Christ our redemer, one body and church which is redeemed: so there is but
one only sacrifice, Heb. 7.9.10.
whereby we be redeemed, which was ones and never but ones made upon the aultare
of the cross for the sins of all men.

This sacrifice is propitiatorye, and a sufficient price, and ransom of the
whole world, as S. John. says, he is the propitiation for our sins, and not
for our sins only, 1. Io. 2
but for the sins of the whole world, and in his Gospel he writes, John. 1.
Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world.

The virtue of this sacrifice began, when God promised that the seed of Adam
should brusse and break the serpents head, Genesis 3.
without the merit of this sacrifice there is no salvation, 2. cor. 5.
for God was in Christ reconcilyng the world to him self.

This sacrifice is common to both the testamentes, where of both take their
effect, whose virtue is extended from the beginning of the world to the last
end, for the la^be was slain from the beginning of the world, Apo. 13.
as S. John says.

It is also a bloody and passible sacrifice, extendinge to the death of him
that offered him self, and it was promised to the fathers, Galat. 3.
and performed in the fullness of time, Galat. 4.
the merits whereof receaueth no augmentation, because it is perfect, nor yet
diminution, because it is eternal. And although this sacrifice be sufficient
to save all men, yet it is not effectual to the salvation of al men: it is
able to save al, but yet all be not saved: for what does it profit the Turks,
Saracenes, unfaithful gentiles, and counterfeyte Christians? The fault is no^
in god, being merciful to al his works, who created us without us: but the
fault is in our selfs.

Therefore yt this sacrifice of Christ, as it is sufficient for all, so it
may be effectual and profitable for all.

God has ordained certain means, whereby we may be made able to receive the
merit of it* and whereby the virtue of it is brought and applied unto us in the
new Testamente, after his passion, as it was to the fathers in the old
testament before his passion.

Of these means some be inward, some be outward: the inward be common to both
the testamentes, of which the first and principal is faith, for without faith
it is not possible to please God, Heb. 11
and as S. John says, John. 3
he that believes not, is now already judged: to him therefore that is an
infidel, Christ has dyed in vain.

Charity also is a mean, for he that loves not, 1. Io. 3.
remains in death, 1. Io. 2,
he that hates his brother, is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and can
not tell whether he goes: and if I have all faith, 1. cor. 13*
and have no charity, I am nothing.

He is not therefore partaker of Christ's merits in the remission of sin,
that lacks charity. And so may we say of hope, without the which no man
receaueth mercy at Christ's hand.

Among the inward means there be other spiritual sacrifices, as the
sacrifice of a contrite heart, Psalm, 50.
which GOD does much regard, the sacrifice of our lyppes, Osee. 14
which is prayer and praise of God, whereby we atteyne remission of sin
having a plain promise, Luke. 11
that whatsoever we ask of god in the name of Christ, we shall obtain it. Mat.
7.
And the sacrifices of almose and benevolence, which Saint Paul would not have
us to forgette* Heb. 13
because God is gotten and won by such sacrifices.

All these and other such like do not fully deserve grace and remission of
sin, but be means, that the virtue and merit of christ's passion may be
derived and applied unto us, as he has ordained.

There be also other outward means* as sacraments and sacrifices. Of
Sacraments some be propre to the old Testament, some propre to the new,
without the which ordinarely there is no remission of sin, nor collation of
grace.

As circumcision was to the fathers, so baptism is to us, without the which
this bloudye sacrifyce takes not away original sin, not because it can not,
but because God has so ordained. For as it is said in the old Testament, Genesis
17.
whose flesh is not circumcised, his soul shall be put away from the people:
so it is said in the new Testamente, except a man be borne again of the
water and the holy Ghost, he can not see the kyngedome of God: John. 3
John. 6.
and except ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye
shall not have life in you: and except ye do penance, ye shall all likewise
peryshe. Luke. 13


And so must we think of all other Sacraments of both the testamentes, that
they be means ordained of God to atteyne yt grace they signifye, which grace
is fully purchased and deserved by the passion of Christ, whereof only they
take their effect: for the old sacraments have their virtue and strength ex
opere operando (as the schole men say) yt is to say, of the work that is
to be wroughte upon the cross by Christ, in whom only they believed: the new
Sacraments have their virtue ex opere operato, of the work of Christ, that is
already wrought upon the cross, and not of any worthynes of the priest the
minister, by the merit of which work upon the cross, they have virtue and
efficacye appropryed unto the^ to give that grace they signifye to such as
worthelye receive them, or at least yt have no impedimente, nor put no
stop, but that the grace may be received.

Beside the Sacraments there be sacrifices instituted of GOD, as means whereby
the passion of Christ, the true sacrifice is signified, represented and
applied, Exo. 12.19. Leui. 1.4 5.7. Leuit. 3.
as the paschall lamb, the continual sacrifice for sin, a sacrifice for
giving thanks, for the sins of the priest, and of the people, for infirmity
and omission, for peace, for any benefit to be atteyned, for chastitye, and
such other which had strength not by their own nature, but by the virtue of
Christ's passion which they signified.

And as these were sacrifices propre to the old Testament, so Christ has
instituted a new external sacrifice propre to the new Testamente, by his
passion abrogating the other which were shadows signifyinge, and stablyshynge
this which is the truth representyng, for this intent, that the virtue and
sufficiencye of his bloody and saving sacrifice may be without iteration of it
self continually transferred unto us. For seeing there is but one God, author
of both the Testamentes, one body, one faith of Christ to us both, though they
believed in Christ to come, we in Christ al ready commed: it follows
consequently, that we of the new Testament may not lack this mean of
sacrifice so necessary and expediente for us: for so should we (as I have
partlye touched in my last sermon) be without all kind of religion, having
now no sacrifice remaining propre unto our selfs.

Like as to the imperfect law there succeeded a perfyte law, and to the
figurative sacraments there succeeded perfyte and effectual workynge
sacraments: even so to the figurative and typical sacrifices, there succedeth
one true and perfyte sacrifice of Christ, one in substance, but diverse in
manner.

Law, sacrifice, priesthood, and aultare be (as the Logitians say) relatiua,
that is to say, one hangyng and dependyng upon an other, as saint Paul
says. Translato facer dotio necesse est, Heb. 7
ut legis translatio fiat. If the priesthood be translate, then the law must
needs be translate likewise.

And then like as if there be a father, there is a son, if there be a
master, there is a servant: so if there be a new law of the new Testament,
there is also a priesthood, a sacrifice, and an aultare properlye belongyng to
the new Testament.

A perfyte and continual law requires a perfyte sacrifyce of like
continuance: the new law of it should lack a priesthood and sacrifice
private to it self, it should either be imperfite, or else utterly destroyed.

For this cause our savior Christ in his last supper, did institute the
sacrament of his body and blood co^mendinge unto us two several uses of it,
the one that it should be received of us, as our heavenly food to nourishe us
in spiritual life till we come to be perfect men in Christ, saying: take eat
this is my body. 1. cor. 11


The other use, that it should be offered in the remembrance of his passion,
the ministratio^ of which offering he has committed to his Apostels, as to
priests of the new law, saying, do this in my remembrance, for the which
function they and their successors be specially priests.

This is the doctrine of christ's catholic church which I have as yet but
simplye declared, not euidentlye proved, which is sufficient to persuade an
obedient catholic man that follows the church, but not sufficient to
convince an obstinate heretic, that denies the Church, impugnyng the
doctrine and determination of ye Church.

But to our purpose* that the oblation of Christ's body and blood in the
Mass is the sacrifice of the Church, and propre to the new Testament I shall
prove it you by the best arguments that we have in our school of divinity,
that is to say, first by the institution of our Savior Christ, then by the
prophecye of Malachie the Prophet, thirdlye by the figure of Melchisedech in
the old law, and this shall I do not expoundyng the scriptures after mine
own head, but as they have been taken from the beginning of the most
ancient and Catholic fathers in all ages.

This sacrifice was instituted by the commandment of CHRIST saying to his
Apostles, 1. cor. 11
do this in my remembrance.

Our new men laughe at us where we say, that this commandment of Christ
does prove the oblation of the Sacrament. But we pitye them, that set so
light by that they are bounden to believe, and can not disprove, semyng
euidentlye not to regard and way the fact of Christ, and their obedience to
his commandment.

When Christ said, Do this: by this word (this) must needs be understand all
that he did, concerning the institution of this Sacrament. Let us now see what
Christ did.

First he did consecrate his preciouse body and blood by blessing the bread,
saying, this is my body, this is my blood, for if this consecration be not
comprehended under this word ( Hoc, this) then have we no commandment nor
authority to consecrate this sacrament, and so should we be usurpers to do
that thing we have no warraunt to show for us in holy scripture. But without
doubt, this is so plain, that we need say no more of it, except we should
utterly deny this sacrament, and the whole ministration of it, which (I
think) no man does.

Secondarely Christ did offer* that he did consecrate, which appears by
these his words: This is my body, which is given for you. And although this
oblation may be proved sufficientlye otherwise, yet to my simple judgment
there seems to be no little argument in this word ( datur is given): for
saying the scripture says, it is given for us, and not to us, as Zwinglius
and our great Archebisshoppe his disciple would have it, we must needs
understand by (given for us) offered for us, so that in this place and many
other, to give, is to offer.

And although it be true, that Christ was given and offered for us to the
father upon the cross the next day folowinge, yet because the word ( datur)
is in greek in all ye Evangelists, where it is expressed in the present tense,
and also every sentence is true for the time it is pronounced: therefore me
think I may certainly conclude, because Christ says, datur pro uobis, is
given for you, that even then in the supper time he offered his body for us to
his father.

Thirdly Christ did deliver to his disciples to be eaten and dronken, that he
had before consecrated and offered, and this appears by his words, Take,
eat, Mat. 26.
and drink ye all of this. The first and third which be the consecration and
receauyng, be out of all controversy confessed of al men.

The second which is the oblation, is of late brought in question, which I
have partly proved by the plain words of scripture, as it seems to me, so
that I may well reason thus: Christ's action is our instruction (I except his
wonderful works and miracles) specially when his commandment is joined unto
it. But Christ in his supper offered him self verily and really under the
forms of bread and wine after an impassible manner, and commanded us to do
the same, till his second coming: me think therefore, that in the Mass we
do and ought to do sacrifice, and offer Christ unto his father, which
oblation is the external sacrifice of the Church, and propre to the new
Testament.

And for further prove that Christ offered him self in his last supper, I
shall allege unto you the authority of the Church, and the consent of ye
fathers in this point, which ought to suffice any Christen man.

Ireneus writes in his fourth book, Ireneus lib. 4*
that Christ taking the creature of bread and giving thanks said, This is my
body, and likewise confessing the cup to be of his blood. Noui testamenti
nouam docuit oblationem, quam Ecclesia ab Apostolis accipiens in uniuerso mundo
offert Deo, de quo in duodecim Prophetis Malachias sic praesignificauit, Non
est mihi uoluntas in uobis. etc.

He taught the new oblation of the new testament, which oblation the Church
receauyng of the Apostels, does offer to GOD throughout the whole world,
whereof Malachye one of the twelve Prophets did prophecye. I have no will and
pleasure in you. etc.

What can be more plain, then that Christ in his last supper in the
ministration of the blessed sacrament did teach his Apostles the new oblation
of the new Testament, and his Apostles taught the Church the same that they
received, and the Church does continuallye use to offer the same to GOD in
every place?

This aucthority the words being so manifest, and the author so aunciente and
substantial, can not be avoided with all their cauillations.

S. Cyprian also the blessed Martyr writes thus. Cyprian. li. 2. epi. 3
Si Christus summus sacerdos sacrificium Deo patri ipse primus obtulit, and hoc
fieri in sui commemorationem praecepit, utique ille sacerdos uice Christi uere
fungitur, qui id quod Christus fecit imitatur If Christ the high priest did
first him self offer a sacrifice to God his father, and commanded the same to
be done in his remembrance, verelye that priest does truly occupye the office
of Christ, that by imitation does ye same thing that Christ did.

This holy martyr teaches us, that Christ did first offer him self to his
father in his supper, and also commanded us to do the same. Why should any man
doubt of that, that in the beginning of ye church the holy martirs did,
and taught without al doubt.

Hesichius also that flouryshed in the time of Gratiane the Emperor writes
thus. Hesichius lib. 2. ca, 8.
Prius figuratam ouem coenans cum Apostolis, postea suum obtulit sacrificium,
and deinde sicut ouem semetipsum occidit. Christ in his supper did first eat
the figuratyue lamb with his Apostels, then he offered his own sacrifice, and
after that he killed him self like a la^be.

By this saying that christ killed him self, is meant, that christ voluntarely
did offer him self to the death, suffering the Jews to kyl him whom he might
have withsta^ded: but to our purpose. It is plain, yt beside the bloudye
oblation upon the cross, and also beside the figurative oblatio^ of him self
in the pascal lamb, he also did offer him self mistically in the celebration
of the sacrament, which is the very point that we go about to prove, and
is manifestlye proved by this ancient author.

Damascen says: In nocte in qua seipsum obtulit, Damasco nus, lib. 4* cap. 14.
testamentu^ nouu^ disposuit. In that night when he offered him self, he did
ordeyne and institute the new testament. Mark that he says, he offered him
self in the night: ye oblation upon the cross was in the mydde day, which is
a distinct offering from that in the night. And Theophilactus says:
Theophilactus in Math. ca. 28.
Tunc immolauit seipsum ex quo tradidit discipulis corpus suum. It is manifest
that then he offered him self, when he delivered too his disciples his body:
teachinge us, that christ in his mystical supper offered him self too his
father. To this Saint Augustyne bears witness, wrytinge thus. August, de
baptismo. li. 3* ca 19.
Vnde ipse dominus etiam quos mundauit a lepra, ad eadem sacramenta misit, ut
offerrent pro se Sacrificium Sacerdotibus, quia nondum eis successerat
sacrificium quod ipse post in Ecclesia uoluit celebrari pro omnibus illis* For
which cause our lord him self sent them whom he had made clean from their
lepre to the same sacraments (of the old Testamente) that they should offer
to the priests a sacrifice for them selfs, because as yet that sacrifyce did
not succeed to them, which Christ would have celebrate in his church instead
of al the^* Way these words well, and ye shall perceive, that they can not be
understand of the sacrifyce of christ upon the cross, which was but ones
offered, and can not be continual celebrate and used of the church, nor yet of
ye sacrifice of tha^kesgiuing, which succedeth not the other, but was before
and with the other: and therefore they prove plainly, that this one sacrifice of
the new testament yt succedeth the multitude of the old sacrifices, is only
the sacrifice of Christ's body and blood in the blessed Mass which he has
ordained to be daily frequented in his church to the worlds end.

What should I allege moo authors? Will ye yet hear one of the eldest, I mean
Dionisius Areopagita S. Paul's scholar, and Bisshoppe of Athens, he writes
thus: Dionisius Areop. Specul. cap. 3
Quocirca reuerenter simul and ex pontificali officio post sacras diuinorum
operum lauds, quod hostiam salutarem (quae supra ipsum est) litet, se excusat,
ad ipsum primo decenter exclamans, tu dixisti, hoc facite in meam
commemorationem. Wherefore the bishop reverently and according to his pastoral
office, after the praise and commendation of Gods works and benefytes, he
does excuse him self, that he does take upon him to offer that sacrifice of
our savior, which is far above his degree and dignity, crying first unto
him decentlye.

Lord thou dyddeste command, saying: Do this in my remembrance. If there
were no more but this one aucthoritye, it were sufficient to prove, that the
priest does offer the body of Christ, which is the sacrifyce of our Savior
in the Mass, and that he offers it by the express commandment of Christ,
saying Do this in my remembrance, and that he offers that thing, which is
far exceadynge his degree, which can be nothing else but the body of
Christ.

Therefore leauyng for shortness of time all other aucthorities, which with
little labor I could bring in for this purpose, me think I may well
conclude, that the oblation of Christ's body and blood in the Mass is the
very sacrifice of the Church, both by ye institution of Christ, declared by
his express commandment, which we are all bounden to obey, and also by his
own example in offering him self under the forms of bread and wine, which
we priests are bounden to follow, as the scripture which I have alleged, does
evidently prove* the true sense whereof is as is recyted not pryuate,
proceadynge from mine own brain, but catholyke, confirmed by the consent of
ye church able to reprove and convince any one manne, that has nothing to
say to the contrary, but his bare nay.

Beside the institution which were sufficient for this matter, seeing in the
doctrine of faith, the proof depends upon the weight of one place, and not
upon the number of many: yet I shall allege unto you the prophecye of Malachy,
where it is prophesied before, that God would refuse and reiecte the sacrifices
of the Jews, and that he would call unto vys grace and mercy the gentiles in
whose Church there should be one pure and clean sacrifice, succedyng all the
other, and offered in every place, which can be none other but this one pure
sacrifice of Christ's body in the Mass. The place is this. Malachi as.1.
Non est mihi uoluntas in uobis, and munus non suscipiam de manu uestra: ab
ortuenim solis usque ad occasum magnu^* est nomen meum in gentibus, and in omni
loco sacrificabitur and offeretur nomini meo oblatio munda. I have no will and
pleasure in you, and I will receive no offering or reward of your hand. For
from the risinge of the sun to the setting, my name is great among the
gentyles, and in every place there shall be sacrifice done, and a pure and cle^^^
oblation shall be offered to my name.

This place is very plain for the detestynge of the Jews* the reiectinge of
their sacrifices, for the vocation of the gentyles* and for the pure and one
singular sacryfyce, that among them shall be offered to almightye God in
every place instead of the other. This must needs be ye sacrifice of the
Mass, or else let them that say nay, show of what other the place is meant.
And in very deed some have bestowed all their wit and learning, writing
and rackynge this place to make it serve to some other sacrifyce beside ye
Mass, but it will not be, the truth has ever prevailed. Some have drawn it to
the spiritual inward sacrifices of good men's hearts: but in ye understanding
they be overthrown, for the place speaks precisely of one sacrifice, and the
other spiritual sacrifices be many, and so many as there be hearts of good
men to offer them. And it speaks also of one pure and clean sacrifice* but
all the rightwesnes of man is imperfect, vnpure, unclean and compared to a
fylthy cloth of a sick woman, and it speaks of such one pure sacrifice as
shall succeed and follow in the place of the other sacryfices of the Jews,
which god rejects and abrogateth. But the inward spiritual sacrifices of
good men have been offered and used before the law, in the law, and after the
law, from the time of Adam til the worlds end. Wherefore it is not possible,
that this place should be directly and only understood of the spiritual
sacrifices.

There be other also yt wrast it, and would have it mean only of the bloody
sacrifice of christ upon the cross. But that can not be, the words be so
plain to the contrary. For although that be one and pure sacrifice, yet it was
not offered in every place, as Malachie says, it shall, and also it was
offered only among the Jews upon the mount of Caluary, where the Prophet
says, this sacrifice he speaks of, shall be offered in every place among
the gentyles.

Therefore to conclude, this is a plain prophecye, declarynge the will of God to
have all the sacrifices of the Jews to cease, and in the church of his new
people the gentiles, to have this one pure sacrifice of Christ's body and
blood in the Mass to be frequented in every place, wherewith he is well
pleased and contented.

And in this sense Irenaeus takes it, Irenaeus lib. 4. ca* 32.
whose words in Latin I alleged a little before that Christ confessyng the cup
to be of his blood, did teach the new oblation of the new testament, which
the church receiving of the Apostles, offers to God throughoute the world,
of the which Malachye one of the twelve Prophets did speak before, I have
no will nor pleasure in you, and so forth. As I have recyted before, manifestly
declarynge that the old people should cease to offer to God, and that the
new people shall offer unto him one pure sacryfice in every place.

Chrysostom. in Psalm. 95
Chrysostom also says, Et in omni loco sacrificium offeretur nomini meo, et
sacrifium puru^* Vide quam lucul^^ter quamque dilucide mystica^ interpretatus
est mensam, quae est incruenta hostla. And in every place a sacrifice shall be
offered to my name, and that a pure sacrifice. See how evidently and how
plainly he does interpret the mystical table, which is the unbloody
sacrifice. I need not to open this place any more, being so plain as it is.

Saint Augustyne writing against the Jews says thus. August. contra
Iudaeosca. 9
Aperite oculos tandem aliquando, and uidete ab orient sole usque ad
occidentem non in uno loco ut uobis fuit constitutum, sed in omni loco offerri
sacrificium Christianorum, non cuilibet Deo, sed ei qui ista prae dixit Deo
Israel. Open your eyes at last you Jews, and see from the rising of the sun
to the setting, not in one place as it was ordained among you, but in every
place to be offered the sacrifice of Christen men, not to every God, but to him
that prophesied these before the GOD of Israel.

The like sayings he has writing upon the.106. Psalm, and in his book
contra aduersarium legis. lib. 1. ca. 20. which I omit, lest I should be tedious
to you, and to curiouse in so plain a matter.

Ye have heard the thing proved by the Gospel, by the Prophet, now hear the
proof of the figure taken out of the law. The Psalm says. Tu es sacerdos
in aeternum, psalm, 109.
secundum ordinem Melchisedech. Thou art (meaning Christ) a priest after the
order of Melchisedech.

Melchisedech was a priest of the most hygheste God, as appears both by his
words and factes, in that he blessed Abraham, and also received tithes of him,
whose oblation was bread and wine, which he offered to God, meeting with
Abraham coming from the spoil of the kings. Genesis 14.


As for such fond cauillations, as some make for that the book says, non
obtulit ^ed protulit, I let pass, as things nothing furthering their purpose,
nor yet hindering ours.

This is plain by Saint Paul, Heb. ^
that every Bishop and priest is ordained to offer sacrifice. If Christ our
savior be a priest, and that after the order of Melchisedech, as the Psalm,
and S. Paul do witness, psalm. 109
then it must needs follow, that Christ had some thing to offer, which is
nothing but him self, and to no creature but to god, whith he was him self,
seeing every sacrifice is that honor that is due only to God. And that he
offered him self after the order of Melchisedech which must be under the
forms of bread and wine. For that was the order and manner of Melchisedech.
Which kind of offering he never made, except it were in his last supper,
and for that cause and reason we may conclude, that Christ in his supper did
offer him self to his father for us, not by sheddyng of his blood by death,
which was the order and manner of Aarons offering, but without sheddyng of his
blood under the fourmes of bread and wine, which was the order of
Melchisedech.

And that this is not my private collectio^, but the mind of all the aunciente
fathers, I shall with your patience recite their sentences.

Saint Cyprian says, Cyprian libro. 2. epist. 3,
Qui magis Sacerdos Dei summi, qua^ Dominus noster Jesus Christus qui
sacrificium Deo patri obtulit, and obtulit hoc idem quod Melchisedech, id est,
panem and uinum, suum scilicet corpus and sanguinem. Who is more the Priest of
the highest GOD then our Lord Jesus Christ who offered a Sacryfyce to GOD the
father, and offered the same that Melchisedech did, that is to say, bread and
wine, that is to say, his body and blood.

And a ly^le after he says: qui est plenitudo ueritatem prae figuratae
imaginis adimpleuit. Christ which is the fulness fulfilled the truth of this
image that was figurate before.

By these places of Cyprian we learn* that Melchisedech and his offering were
figures of Christ, and his offering in his supper, and like as Melchisedech
offered bread and wine, so Christ being the truth offered his body and blood
under the forms of bread and wine, And lest any man should be offended with
that Cyprian says, hoc idem quod Melchisedech, the same that Melchisedech.
Hear what S. Hierome says more plainly. Hieron in psalm. 109.
Quomodo Melchisedech obtulit panem and uinum, sic and tu offeres corpus tuum
and sanguinem, uerum panem and uerum uinum

Like as Melchisedech offered bread and wine: so thou shall offer thy body and
blood, ye true bread and the true wine.

The other was the figurative bread and wine, this is the true bread and
wine, the truth of that figure, not the same in substance, but ye same in
mysterye.

The same S. Hierome among his epistles has an epistle of the godly matrone
Paula ad Marcellam, wherein be these words. Recurre ad Genesim and Melchisedech
regem Salem. Paula ep^ ad Marcellam.
Huius principe^ inuenies ciuitatis, qui iam tunc in typo Christi panem and
uinum obtulit, et mysterium Christianum in saluatoris sanguine and corpore
dedicauit. Return (says Paula) to the book of Genesis and to Melchisedech
the king of Salem, and thou shalt find the prince of that city, which even
then in the figure of Christ offered bread and wine, and did dedicate the
mystery or sacrament of the Christians in the blood and body of our savior.

Mark in this most manifest place the oblation of the figure* which is bread
and wine, and the oblation of the truth, which is the mystery of us Christen
men, the body and blood of our Savior Christ.

And it is to be noted, what is meant by this word (order) which S. Hierome
expounds thus.

Mysterium nostrum in uerbo ordinis significauit, Hieron* quest in Genesim
nequaquam per Aaron irrationabilibus uictimis immolandis, sed oblato pane and
uino.i. corpore et sanguine Domini Jesus.

By this word (order) he did signifye and express our mysterye, not by
offering of unreasonable and brute beasts as Aaron did, but by the oblation
of bread and wine, that is to say, the body and blood of our Lord Jesus.

After this fathers mind order is taken for the manner of offering, not by
sheddynge of blood, but vnbloudelye, as we offer Christ's body and blood in
our misterye. For Christ's offering, concerning the substance of it was but
one, but concerning the order and manner, it was diverse, upon the cross after
the order Aaron, in the supper after the order of Melchisedech. For so S.
Augustyne says: August. in psalm. 33
Coram regno patris sui, id est, Iudaeorum mutauit uultum suum, quia erat ibi
sacrificium secundum ordinem Aaron, and postea ipse de corpore and sanguine suo
institu it sacrificium secundum ordine^ Melchisedech* Before ye kingdom of his
father, that is to say the Jews, he changed his countenance, for there he
was a sacrifice after the order of Aaron, and afterward he did institute a
sacrifice of his body and blood, after the order of Melchisedech.

Mark the diuersitye and distinction of these two offerynges of Christ, not
in substance but in order, that is to say, the manner, and that christ did
institute the sacryfyce of his body and blood to be offered of us after ye
order of Melchisedech, which thing he expresses more plainly in an other
book, expoundynge a place of Ecclesiastes.

Non est bonu^ homini nisi quod manducabit and bibet, August. de ciuit. dei.
li. 17. cap. 20.
saying thus. Quid credibilius dicere intelligitur, quam quodad parti
cipationem mensae huius pertinet, qua^ and sacerdos ipse media tor noui
Testamenti exhibet secundum ordinem Melchisedech de corpore and sanguine suo?
Id enim sacrificium successit omni bus illis sacrificijs ueteris testamenti,
quae immolaba^tur in umbra futuri. What is more credible we should think he
meant by those words, then that perteyneth to the participation of this table,
which Christ him self a priest and mediator of the new Testamente does
exhibit after the order of Melchisedech of his body and blood? For that
sacryfyce did succeed all the other sacrifices of the old Testament, which
were offered in the shadow of this to come.

What can be playner then this, to show the figure of our mysterye to be
abrogated, and the truth which is our sacrifyce in the body and blood of
Christ in form of bread and wine to succeed?

But to end this matter, hear one place playnest of al, which O^cumenius
has upon this place of Saint Paul. Tues sacerdos inaeternum. etc.
O^cumenius in ca. ad Hebraeos.
in these words. Significat ser mo, quod non solum Christus obtulit incruentam
hostiam (siquidem suum ipsius corpus obtulit) uerum etiam qui ab ipso fungentur
sacerdotio, quorum Deus pontifex esse diguntus est sine sanguinis effusione
offerent. Nam hoc significat (inaeternum). Neque enim de ea quae semel a deo
facta est oblatio, and hostia dixisset inaeternum, sed respiciens ad praesentes
sacrificos, per quos medios Christus sacrificat and sacrificatur, qui etiam in
mystica coena modum illis tradidit huiusmodi sacrificij. The word means, that
not only Christ offered an unbloody sacrifice, for he offered his own body,
but also that they which under him use the function of a priest (whose Bishop
he does vouchesafe to be) shall offer without sheddinge of blood. For that
signifies the word (evermore). For concerning that oblation and sacrifice,
which was ones made of God, he would never say (evermore). But having an eye
to those priests, that be now, by whose mediation Christ does sacrifice and
is sacrificed, who also in his mystical supper did by tradition teach them
the manner of such a sacrifice.

This authority if it were any thing doubtful, I would stand in it to open
such points, as were contained therein, but being so manifest as it is, it
neadeth no more, but to desire the hearer or reader to weye it, and he shall see
this matter we goo about to prove, fully resolved, both by the institution of
christ in his last supper, and also by the figure of Melchisedech in the old
law. This aucthorities although there be many moo, yet I think them
sufficient, and I think thereby the matter sufficiently proved. Other
Scriptures there be though not so plain, yet they conteyn an argument to
prove ye same as this of Saint Paul. Non potestis participes esse mensae do
mini et mensae daemoniorum. 1. cor. 10.
ye can not be partakers of our lords table and the table of devils. The word
(table) here is taken for the meat of the table. For men be not partakers of
the material board, but of the meat that is ministered upon the board. Now ye
table of deuyls is taken for that meat that is offered to Idols in which
dyuels did reign, and therefore that meat was called in greek Idolothyton.
meat offered to Idols. Now this is certain by all good learning that in every
comparison there must neades be a proportion and similitude, wherein the
things compared must agree* then whereas these two tables be compared in
offeringe and eatinge, it must needs follow, that if the table of dyuels be a
very sacrifice made to devils in deed, the table of our lord likewise must be
a sacrifice, offered to our lord in deed. And if our lords table be a very
sacryfyce made to him by us, then have we our purpose proved and confessed.

The like argument may be made of the word (aultare) in S. Paul. Habemus
altar de quo edere non habent potesta tem, Heb. 13
qui tabernaculo deseruiu^t. We have an aultare, of which they may not eat,
that serve the tabernacle.

If aultare and sacrifice be ^o annexed together, that the one can not be
without the other, then when saint Paul says, we have an aultare, speaking
also of the eating of that aultare, he must needs mean the sacrifice made
upon the aultare: so that our Sacrament before we eat it, is also a
sacrifice.

For so does Theophilactus take this place. Theophilactus. ca* 13. ad Hebreos.
Et nos inquit obseruationem habemus, haud tamen in esculentis hisce, fed in
ara sieve in hostia illa incruenta et cor pori uitam elargiente. And we also
have an observation, yet not in these common meats, but in our aultare or
vnbloudye sacrifice, which gives life to our bodies.

Here we may see, that he means by the aultare the unbloody sacrifice of
Christ's body, which being eaten of us corporally in the Sacrament gives life
to our bodies.

Moreover if time would serve me, I could make an argument of Daniels Prophecye
of the coming of Antechrist* Dan, 12*
because he says, that in that time the continual sacrifyce shall be by
Antechriste taken away, per tempus, tempora, and dimidium temporis, by ye
space of three years and an half as many take it.

Whether this shall be done al Christendom over at one time, or in every
particulare region at diverse times* it is not certeynlye known to us, and
therefore I will not certeynly determine it. But this is certain, that
Antechriste can not take away the sacrifice of Christ upon the cross* which
was but ones made, and shall never be iterate nor frustrate. Nor he can not
take away the inward spiritual sacrifice of man's heart, which then shall
flourishe most of al i^ the elect. For why should they then fly to the
mountains* (as the book says) but that for the vehemencye of the
persecution, they might more fervently do spiritual sacrifice to almighty God.

Therefore it follows, that the sacrifice of Christen men is such an one, as
may be taken away by Antechrist, which in my judgment can be nothing else,
but the sacrifice of the Mass, or else let them tell, what other sacrifice it
is beside the Mass.

Ye see now, what Scriptures I have brought to prove the oblation of Christ's
body in the Mass to be the sacrifice of the Church and new Testament, which
has been assaulted many ways of many men. But to the oppugnatio^ of it they
never yet to this hour alleged any one direct scripture nor doctor, nor good
reason. They have gone about it, and by tyranny in some places they have
prevailed for a time, but always truth the daughter of time has ouercomed.

Some scriptures they abuse, what they be, ye shall hear, They allege saint
Paul to the Hebrews. He. 9.10
Semel oblatus est ad multorum exhaurienda peccata. Christ was ones offered to
take away the sins of many. Vnica oblatione consu^mauit inaeternum
sanctificatos. With one oblation he has perfited for evermore all that be
sanctified. These be the Scriptures they allege against the Mass, and they
say, Christ's oblation is perfyte, no man can offer Christ but him self,
which he did but ones, and never but ones, as though we should say, that
Christ was crucified twyse or often times.

To this objection of theirs we answer, that Christ was never offered to the
death for our redemption but ones, and yet otherwise was he offered many times,
both of him self and of his creatures.

We read in the Prophet Daniel, Dan. 7.
that Angels offered him in the sight of his father. And also yt the blessed
virgin his mother offered him at her purificatio^, Luc. 3.
of which offering S. Bernard says, Ista oblatio fratres satis delicata
uidetur, Bernard. Ser. 3. de purificatione.
ubi tantum sistitur domino, redimitur auibus and ilico reportatur. This
oblation brethren is very delicate, where he is only presented to our Lord,
redeemed with birds, and by and by brought home again.

And therefore we answer them, that their argument is of no strength, to
confute one truth by an other, when both may be true, as to reason, christ was
but ones offered upon ye cross, ergo he was not offered in the sacrament. And
we tell them, that they do not considre, how Christ is offered three ways of
him self, and also three ways of man.

First he offered him self upon the cross really and corporallye, as Isaias
says, Isai. ^^*
oblatus est quia uoluit. This is manifest enough. And here their exclamacions
of ones ones has very good place.

Secondly he offered him self figuratyuelye in the paschall lamb. For the
scripture says, the lamb was slain from the beginning of the world, Apo.
1^.
and the fathers in the old law in all their sacrifices did offer Christ not
in substance, but in figure, and so Christ offering the paschall lamb at his
supper, offered him self in figure.

Thirdly Christ offers him self in heaven reallye and so continually, as the
same chapter which they bring against the Mass does testifye, Non in
manufacta sancta Jesus intro iuit, Heb. 9
exemplaria uerorum, sed in ipsum coelum ut appareat nunc uultui Dei pro nobis.
Jesus entered not into a temple made with man's hand a figure of the truth,
but into heaven, that he might appear now to the countenance of God for us.

What is this appearyng in the sight of GOD for us, but an offering of him
self for us to pacifye the anger of god with us, to represente his wounds and
all that he suffered for us, that we might be reconciled to God by him?

This is the true and perpetual oblation of Christ in comparison of this in
heaven, the bloudye oblation upon the cross is but an image, as S. Ambrose
says: Hic umbra, Ambros. offi. lib. 1. ca. 48*
hic imago, illic ueritas, umbra in lege: imago in Euangelio, ueritas in
coelestibus: ante agnus offerebatur, uitulus, nunc Christus of fertur: sed
offertur quasi homo, quasi recipiens passionem, and offert se ipse quasi
Sacerdos ut peccata nostra dimittat, hic in imagine, ibi in ueritate, ubi apud
patrem pro nobis quasi aduocatus interuenit.

Here (in this world) there is a shadow, here there is an image, there (in
heaven) is truth, the shadow in the law the image in the gospel, the truth
in heaven. Before a lamb and calfe were offered, now Christ is offered, but
he is offered as manne, and receauynge passion, and he offers him self as
being a priest to take our sins away, here in image, there in truethe, where
with the father as an advocate he makes intercession for us,

The same thing he writes also upon the.38. Psalm So that it is very plain
without all controversy, that Christ does offer him self now most
perfectly in heaven for us, being our advocate to the father face to face, and
as S. John says. 1. Io. 2.
Ipse est propitiatio pro peccatis nostris, He is a sacrifice propitiatorye for
our sins, he says not he was, but is, and after the most perfytest manner
that can be, in respect whereof the very true and real oblation for our
redemption upon the cross, is an image.

So that by this we see by the plain Scripture, that Christ offered him self
three ways, beside the oblation of him self in his supper, which is the point
we be about to declare.

And even so is he offered of man three ways likewise. First fyguratiuelye,
in the oblation of the old Testament.

When Abraham being about to offer his own dear son, and by GODS
provision offered in his stead a ram, and when Melchisedech offered bread
and wine, and the Jews the Paschall lamb and their burnte offerynges: what
did they offer but Christ in figure, whose passion those offerynges did
sygnifye? Which offerynges did of them self work nothing inwardlye, and
therefore were called Iustitia carnis the ryghtewesnes of the flesh* but by them
they did proteste their sin, and declared their faith, of whom they looked
to have remission.

Secondly we offer Christ mysticallye in our daily sacrifice of the Mass,
where Christ is by his omnipotent power presented to us in the Sacrament, and
of us again represented to his and our father, and his passion renewed, not by
sufferynge of death again, but after an vnbloudye manner, not for this end,
that we should thereby deserve remission of our sins, but that by our
faith, devotion, and this representation of his passion we most humblye pray
almyghtye GOD to apply unto us by Christ that remission, which was purchased
and deserved by his passion before.

The host of these two sacrifices upon the cross and upon the aultare, is all
one in substance, but the manner is diverse, and the end is diverse, that by
this means (as christ him self has instituted) we might celebrate and make
commemoration of his passion. This is only the sacrifice of the priest by
publycke ministracion, but verily and in affection it is the sacrifice of the
whole church, which every membre of the Church does use and frequente, and
no man does impugn it, but he that professes open war against the church.

Thirdely christ is offered by man spiritually only by ye meditation of our
mind, when we think and remember his passion, and in our devout prayer
beseech god to show us mercy for it.

Thus every Christen manne and womanne, in all places and times upon the
aultare of his own heart ought to offer Christ too the father, after which
sort of spiritual oblation we be all both men and women, Priests and
kings, being as Saint Peter says, 1. Pet. ^
Sacerdotium sanctum, offerentes spirituales hostias acceptabiles Deo per Iesum
Christum. An holy Priesthood offering spiritual Sacryfices, acceptable to
God by Jesus Christ.

Now considering these three ways, shall it be a good argument, to inculcate
one way, and to reiecte the rest? To allege one membre of a division, to the
reiection of the other? This is the peculiar manner of the heritikes the enemies
of Christ, as they did in the matter of the Sacrament, by the spiritual eating
of Christ, to confute and reject the real and corporal eating of christ's
body in the Sacrament.

Such shifts and fond arguments they have to seduce the unlearned wythall,
which when they be espied and detected they appear as they be deuyllishe and
perniciouse sophistry.

Furthermore if any man as yet does stand in doubt whether men lawfully offer
Christ to the father or no: let him call to remembrance what I have said
before out of Dionisius Areopagita, where the bishop (as he says) does
excuse him self that he offers the host of our salvation, Dionisius Areopa.
Speculat. ca. 3
alledgyng that Christ did so command to be done, saying do this in my
remembrance.

Let him also remember the saying of the counsel at Nice. Conciliu^ Nicen^^*
That the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world, is offered of
the priests not after a bloudye manner.

Saynct Augustine says: Per hoc sacrificium (in forma serui) et sacerilos
est, August. de ciuit. libro. 10. cap. 20.
ipse offerens, ipse et oblatio, cuius rei sacramentum quotidianum esse uoluit
ecclesiae sacrificium, cum ipsius coporis ipse sit caput, et ipsius capitis
ipsa sit corpus, ta^ ipsa per ipsum quam ipse per ipsam suetus offerri. By this
sacrifice (in the form of a servant) Christ is a priest, being him self
both the offerer and the oblation, of which oblation he would the daily
sacrifice of the church should be a sacrament, and seeing he is the head of
that body, and the church is the body of that head, as well the church by
Christ, as Christ by the church is accustomed to be offered.

A notable place resoluyng diners doubts, declarynge that the daily sacrifice
of the church which is the mass, is a sacrament of Christ's passion
represe^ting the same, and further that Christ offering him self upon the
cross did also in him self offer his mystical body the church, and
thirdelye that the church Christ's body not only once or twice, but is
accustomed to offer Christ her head to god in her daily sacrifice.

Hear yet a place of S. Augustine as plain as this. August. contra. Faustum
lib. 20. Capi. 18.
Hebr^i in uictimis pecoru^ prophetia^ celebrabant futurae uictimae quam
Christus obtuli^ unde iam Christiani peracti eiusdem sacrificij, memoriam
celebrant, sacro sancta oblatione and perticipatione corporis and sanguinis
Christi. The Jews in their sacrifices of beasts, did celebrate the prophecye
of the sacrifice to come which Christ offered. The christen men now do
celebrate the memory of ye same sacrifice of Christ that is past, by the most
holy oblation and perticipation of Christ's body and blood.

Mark how that he says christen men celebrate the memory of Christ's
passion, wherwithal? even by the offering of the same body that suffered
passion. I need say no more for this point, that men do and did use from the
beninninge, to offer Christ to the father.

They say the sacrifice of the mass diminishes and takes away the glory
of Christ, they say so, but prove it not.

But in very deed, nothing does more set forth the glory of Christ, and his
true honor: the honor of god is considered two ways, inwardlye by faith,
outwardly by external adoration* Latria which in English signifies the honor
that is due only to God, and to no creature, is the work of faith, and
sacrifice is a kind ( Latriae) of godly honor as Saint Augustine says: Ad
hunc cultum latriae pertinet oblatio sacrificij. August. contra. Faustum.
libro. 20. Capi^. 21.
etc. To this godly honor called Latria, the oblation of sacrifice does
pertayne, and for that cause it is called Idolatrye if any sacrifice be done to
Idols, and therefore we do sacrifice neither to martyr nor yet to an angel, but
only to god.

Faith ought to be unfeigned and lively and then it is true honor. For he that
erreth in faith, or fayneth to have faith, does not exhibit honor and
reverence due to God.

Again he that has true faith, but yet dead for lack of charity, he gives
reverence to god, but not perfect, and therefore not pleasant to god, because
he honors god with his understanding but not with his affection.

He that has true and lively faith, honors and worshyppeth god in spirit
and truth.

The external and outward honor proceeds from the inward honor, and is the
protestation practice and use of it, the work of faith outwardly declared, And
whereas sacrifice is the special and chiefest adoration that can be,
therefore this sacrifice of Christ's own body and blood in the mass being
institute of Christ by his own express commandment (as I have showed
already) does not only not diminishe ye glory of God, but is the very highest
honor of God that manne can give.

They say it is a derogation to the passion of Christ, but it is not so good
people, for the sacrifice of the mass* does ascribe altogether to Christ, for
it is the passion of Christ.

Understande well what I say and judge not till ye hear what I mean.

Saynct Cypriane says: Passio domini sacrificium est quod offerimus. Cyprian.
lib. 2. Epist. 3.
That sacrifice which we offer is the passion of Christ. A strange saying, but
yet S. Augustine declares more playnelye what is meant by it, in these words.
Vocatur ipsa immolatio carnis quae sacerdotis manibus fit, August. libro
sententiaru^ prosperi.
Christi passio mors crucifixio, no^rei ueritate, sed significante mysterio.
The oblation of Christ's flesh which is made in the hands of the priest, is
called Christ's passion, death and crucifienge, not by the truth of the
thing, but by the misterye signifiynge. As though he should say, it is
called Christ's passion, not for that Christ in very deed suffers passion
again, but for that in misterye, it renueth represents, and signifies his
passion again.

For while that we have no worthy thing of our selves nor in our selves to
render to god for all his benefits, and as the Psalm says: Quid retribuam
domino pro omnibus quae retribuit mihi. Ps. 115.
What shall I give to God again, for all yt he have given to me? we maid o eue^
as ye psalm does answer. Calice^ salutaris accipiam and nomen domini inuocabo.
I shall take the cup of our savior and call upon the name of our Lord. I
shall take his passion representing to God the father the work of our
rede^ptio^, yt we thereby being partakers of his bloody sacrifice ones made upon
the cross, and now by this our co^memoration renewed again may be replenished
with the fruit of his passion and death.

For S. Augustine says: Ex ipsis reliquijs cogitationis, August. in. psalm. 75.
id est, ex ipsa memoria quotidie sic nobis immolatur, quasi quotidie nos
mouet, qui prima sua gratia nos innouauit. Of the leauynges of our cogitation,
that is to say, of this very memory and commemoration, Christ is so daily
offered of us, as he does make us new men daily, which by his first grace
(in baptism) did ones make us new.

See how we offer Christ daily in commemoration and what benefit of innovation
we receive thereby.

Chrysostom also says: Non aquam de hoc nobis font largitur, Chrisost. in
Mat. Hom. 7.
sed sanguinum uiuu^ qui quamque ad mortis dominicae testimonium sumitur nobis
tamen causa fit uitae. Christ out of this fountain (of the chalyce) gives
unto us not water, but lyuelye blood, which although it be received for the
testimonye of Christ's death, yet to us it is made a cause of life.

Is not this to have fruit of Christ's passion applied unto us, when we
receive life by receyuynge of that which is offered in commemoration of
Christ's death*

S. Gregorye says, Quoties ei hostiam suae passionis offerimus, Grego. Hom. 37
toties nobis ad absolutionem nostram passionem illius reparamus. As often as
we offer to him the host or sacrifice of his passion, so often we renew and
repair his passion to us for our absolution and perfection. And in another
place he says. Haec uictima singulariter ab aeterno interitu animam saluat,
Grego. dialogo. lib. 4. capi. 58.
quae illam nobis mortem unigeniti per mysterium reparat. This sacrifice does
singularelye save the soul from eternal destruction, which by mysterye
renueth to us the death of gods only begotten son. By these authorities ye
see, that the sacrifice of the mass does nothing derogate from the passion of
Christ, but most of all does exalte it, repayrynge and renewynge it for us in
the sight of the father, that we thereby may be renewed in grace, and receive
life, perfection, and salvation.

Furthermore they say we make our own works (meaning the mass) a savior
beside Christ, which is nothing so, but by this sacrifice of the mass, we
declare, that we believe there is no savior but only Christ,

For what do we in the mass? We confess our sins our unworthiness, our
unkindness, our manifold transgressions of his eternal law, we grant that we be
not able to satisfy for the least offense we have done, therefore we run to
his passion, which (after this sort as he has ordained) we renew and
represent. We beseech our most merciful father, to look upon Christ's merits,
and to pardone our offenses, to look up on Christ's passion, and to releue our
affliction.

We knowledge that what so ever we have done is vnparsite and vnpure, and as it
is our work, does more offend his majesty then please him therefore we offer
unto him his well-beloved son Jesus, in whom we know (...) is well pleased,
most hum^^ye prayinge him to accept him, for us in whom only we trust*
accomptynge him all our righteousness, by whom only we co^ceyue hope of
salvation. And therefore in the end of the canon of the mass we say thus.

Non aestimator meriti sed ueniae quaesumus largitor admit, per Christum
dominum nostrum. O Lord we beseech thee to admit us into the company of thy
saynctes not wayinge our merits but granting us pardon by Christ our Lord.

Also whatsoever thing we lack* all plagues all misfortunes, all adversity
both ghostly and temporal, we require to be released of them not through our
worthynes* but for the merits of Christ's passion.

Consider all this good people and see whether in this doing we make our works
a new savior beside Christ or no? We believe also that our prayer is of more
efficacy and strength in the presence of Christ in the time of the sacrifice,
then at any other time. For so says S. Cypriane. In huius corporis presentia
non superuacue mendicant lachrimae ueniam, Cyprian. de cena.
nec unquam patitur contriti cordis holocaustum repulsam* In the presence of
this body, the tears of a man does not beg forgiveness in vain, nor the
sacrifice of a contrite heart does never suffer repulse. And as Chrysostom
says, Chrisost. in act. hom. 3.
In illa horadum mors illa perficitur, et horrendum sacrificium, quasi sedente
rege, quaecu^que uolueris perficies. In that hour whiles that Christ's death
is celebrate and his fearful sacrifice, even as the king were sittynge upon
his mercy seat what soever thou will thou shalt bring to pass. Stante
siquidem uniurso populo, manus in celum extendente, caetu item sacerdotali,
Chrisost. ad philip Hom. 3.
uerendoque posito sacrificio, quomodo deum non placaremus pro istis orantes?
For when all the people stands holdyng up their hands to heaven, and the
company of the priests like wise, and the fearful and honorable sacrifice is
upon the altar, how shall not we mitigate god praying for them? And therefore
specially then in the mass time, we pray for the whole church, for all
princes and high powers, for all bishops and pastors, for our selves, our
friends, and all that be present, for peace, for plentye, for all that we have
need upon, as Chrysostom writes: In manibus est hostia, adsunt angeli,
Chrisost. in acta, Hom. 21,
adsunt archa^geli, adest filius dei, cum tanto horrore astent omnes, astent
illi clamantes omnibus silentibus, putas temere hec fieri? ergo et alia temere
and quae pro ecclesia pro sacerdotibus offeruntur, and quae pro plenitu dine
acubertate absit. The host of our sacrifice is in the priests hands, the
angels be present, the archangels be present, the son of God is present. When
all men stand with such trembling, when the angels stand criyng the other
holding their peace, do thou think these things are done in vain? Then the
other also be done in vain both that be offered for the church, for the
priests, and also for plentye and abundaunce: god forbydde.

One notable place of Chrysostom I think yet expedient to rehearse unto you
concerning this matter. Vt homines ramos olearum ge rentes mouere reges
consueue runt, Chrisost. de incom. deinatu.
eoque arboris genere miseri cordiam commemorant and humanitatem: sic angeli
tunc pro ramis oleaginis corpus domini ipsum protendentes, rogant pro genere
humano, quasi dicant, pro his domine rogamus quos tu adeo dilexisti, ut pro
eorum salute mortem obires, animam cruce efflares, pro his supplicamus pro
quibus ipse tuum largitus es sanguinem, pro his oramus pro quibus corpus hoc
immolasti. Like as men bearing branches of Olyue trees are wont to move
kings to compassion, and with that kind oftre do put them in remembrance of
mercy and pity: even so the angels then (in the sacrifice time) in stead of
Olive branches, holding forth the body of Christ pray for mankind, as
saying thus: Lord we pray for the^ whom thou have so loved, that for their
salvation thou have suffered death and spent thy life upon the cross we make
supplication for the^ for whom thou haste given thy blood, for them we pray,
for whom thou have offered this same very body.

Now considering this felowshyppe with angels, this humility of man, this
pacifiynge of God, this efficacy of prayer for the sacrifice sake, this
knowledgynge of our unworthiness, this our only trust in the passion of Christ:
can any manne justly burden us that we make our works a new savior beside
Christ?

Furthermore, beside prayinge for those things we lack, we also by this
sacrifice give thanks for our rede^ptio^, for the hope of our health and
salvation, and for all gods gifts, not only in our words, but also in
dead? the very oblation it self is a real geuynge of thanks to god, as
Chrysostom says. Quod erat apud eum omnibus preciosius, Chrisost. in Mat.
HoM, 26
unigenitum pro nobis filium dedit, and cum essemus inimici, nec dedit solum,
sed et nostram mensam fecit illum, omnia faciens ipse pro nobis, and dona^do
uidelicet and gratiarum actores ipsa donorum suorum ubertate faciendo. etc.
That thing that was with him most preciouse of all, his only son he has
given for us, even when we were his enemies, and not only has given him for
us, but also has made him our table, doing him self al things for us,
both rewarding us, and also with the plentye of his gifts making us geuers
of thanks, and because man in many things is unthankful to God, he in all
things takes upon him our person, and supplieth that we ought to do, and
even by the very nature of the sacrifice which is his body, styrreth us to
continual giving of thanks for all his benefits, so that our sacrifice,
being Christ's body is both a singular gift of God, and also is a real geuinge
of thanks for all his other gifts.

By this it evidently appears that nothing does more exercise our faith in ye
knowledge of our selfs and god, nothing does more increase our charity and
hope in ye mercy of God, then the mass. Where (as Job was wont to do for his
children) ye church of god our mother, being careful for all her children lest
any of the^ by negligence, infirmity or wylfulnes, have offended, daily
prays and makes sacrifice for the^, and by that most acceptable sacrifice
of her husbands body and blood does mitigate almighty god, does multiply
and distributeth unite

Nothing more sets forth the benefit of Christ, because in this sacrifice
of the mass, we protest to have al things by Christ, redemption, remission,
sanctification and salvation, and do ask and beg of God al goodness by
Christ, knowledginge that we have nothing to set against the wrath of God but
the passion of Christ, which after this manner, by this solemn representatio^
as Christ has instituted, we daily renew, yt it might be continually
celebrate by mystery that ones was offered for our ransom, that because the
effect of ma^s redemption cease not, but is to every one in his time applied
by continual succession, so also yt the sacrifice of this redemption should
never cease, but be always to all men present in grace, and always live in
perpetual memory.

The other obiectio^s I will but shortly touch, for they be of no strength nor
authority, one is this. There is no mention nor no one word of any oblation in
the supper, ergo Christ made no oblatio^ there, a goodly reason, So there is no
mention made neither of Christ's own mouth nor of any the evangelists
concerning the oblacion of ye paschal lamb, yet we know most certenlye by the
old testament that the paschall lamb was never eaten but it was offered
before, which we are sure Christ did observe literallye, till the truth of
that figure were established. And also what is more sure then that Christ
offered him self upon the cross, and yet neither Christ's own words, nor
any of the four evangelists writing the story of the passion, make any
mention in plain and express terms of oblation or offering. Though we know
it by other scripture sufficientlye. But their collectio^ is al false, they
should have concluded thus, ergo if there any oblatio^, it is real and not
vocalle, and so it is in deed, and therefore Christ said: Hoc facite. do this,
L^c. 22.
as ye see me do. But in the form of our mass, there be express words of
offering, for ye rude and ignorant, and for ye evidence of ye truth. Vnde and
memores nos domine etc. wherefore we thy servants and people being mindful
of thy son Christ our lord, of his blessed passion resurrection and glorious
ascension, do offer to thy most excellent majesty of thy rewards and gifts,
this pure sacrifice, this holy and undefiled sacrifice, the holy bread of
everlasting life, and the cup of perpetual salvation.

There be also other words of oblatio^ following these words S. Basyll has
the^, Chrysostom, S. Ambrose, the general counsel holden at Ephesus, the
latest of these was.M.CCC. years ago, that it might appear that it is not
newlye brought in, as they would sclaunder it, but ye most ancient thing in all
the mass. They reason also thus. It is a commemoratio^, ergo no sacrifice, as
who say the paschalia^be being the figure of this, was not both a
commemoration and a sacrifice, for the lamb was instituted to be offered for a
memory of ye delyueraunce of the Jews from the swearde of the angel that
smote the first be gotten of the Egiptians, and therefore ye Jews kept this
word of offering the lamb, for a statute for them and their children for
evermore. Even so this lamb of God that lies upon the table of our altar is
a sacrifice offered of us in commemoration of our deliverance from the devil
by the death of Christ. In the old testament the first lamb offered before
there delivery, and the lamb which was offered every year after in memory
of the same delyuerye, were very real lambs in deed of one nature and
condition: even so the lamb of god being Christ, which Christ him self
offered in his supper, there institutinge before his death, what we should
continually do after his death, and ye la^be of God, which we offer now in
memory of our deliuerau^ce, be very real lambs of god in deed, and yet not
diverse in number as the other were, but al one in number, nature, condition and
dignity.

As Chrysostom says: we offer daily in co^memoratio^ of his death, Chrisost,
hom. 17. ^d Hebre.
and ye sacrifice is one, not many. Nor we do not offer one lamb now, to morrow
another, but always the very same, or else because it is offered in many
places, is there many Christ's? No forsooth, but one Christ every where. here
full Christ, and there full Christ, one body. And so forth

The like argument they make against ye real presence It is a sign, ergo not
the thing whereof it is a sign. The folyshnes of this reason eueri baker ca^
tell, who sets one loofe upon his stall to sygnifye there is bread to sell
within his house. Which lofe is both a sign of bread to be sold, and also is
very bread to be sold it self of the same bakyng the other is. Even so the
body of Christ in the Sacrament is Christ's very body in deed, and also a sign
of the same body, as Saint Augustyne says. Carne and sanguine utroque
inuisibili, August. lib. Sent, Prosperi.
spiritu ali, intelligibili, signatur uisibile Domini nostri Jesus Christi
corpus and palpabile, plenum gratia omnium uirtutum and diuina maiestate. By
the flesh and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, both being (in the
sacrament) invisible, spiritual, and intelligible, is signified the visible
body of Christ, and palpable, full of the grace of all virtues, and of the
godly majesty. And even so likewise very Christ is offered in the mysterye in
sign and commemoration of him self offered upon the cross, as S. Augustyne
says Christiani iam peracti sacrificij memoriam celebrant sacrosancta
oblatione and perticipatione corporis and sanguinis Christi. Augusty. co^tra
Faustu^. li. 20. cap, 18.
Christen men now do celebrate a memory of Christ's sacrifice already
paste by the most holy oblation and partitipation of Christ's body and blood.
The like saying has S. Gregorye and diverse aucthors which I omit to
rehearse, Gregorius hom. 22*
because the time is paste.

They say, that neither the Apostles nor none in their time did offer Christ's
body in sacrifice. And yet I have showed you before, that Dionisius Areopagita
S. Paul's disciple (of whom mention is made in the.17. chapter of the Acts
of the Apostles) did offer the sacrifice of Christ's body alledgyng Christ's
commandment for his warraunt.

Ireneus that lived within fiftye year of saint John the Evangelist, and
Polycarpus scholar does make mention of this offering saying. Ecclesiae
oblatio quam Dominus docuit offerri in uniuerso mundo, Ireneus li. 4. cap. 34.
purum sacrifi^ium reputatum est apud Deum, and acceptum est e^. The oblation
of the Church which our Lord taught to be offered in the whole world, is
reputed of God a pure sacrifice and acceptable to him.

And in the same chapter confutynge them that denied the immortalitye of the
flesh, by this reason that our flesh was nourished with Christ's flesh to
eternal life, concludes thus, Aut sententiam mutent, aut abstine ant
offerendo quae praedicta sunt, Either let them change their opinion, or else
absteyn from offering the same body and blood of Christ we spoke of.

Also the general council of Constantinople says, Conciliu^
Constantinopolitanu^ in trul lo. ca. 32.
that saint James did write the form of a Mass. I omytte the Latyne, the
words in English be thus faythfullye translate. Saint James brother to
Christ our God according to the flesh, to whom the church of Jerusalem was
first committed, and Basilius which was Bishop of Caesarea, whose fame is
known throughoute the world* which delivered in writing the mystical
celebration of ye sacrifices, have declared that the cup in our holy
ministerye ought to be of water and wine mengled.

And the holy fathers that were assembled at Carthage, have thus left in
writing, that in the sacrifices nothing else be offered, but the body and
blood of our Lord, as our Lord him self has ordained and so forth. I
never read S. James his book my self, nor I think, it be not now to be had,
but I tell you so much, as I know, that S. James did write the form of a
Mass, as S. Basil did (which we have in greek now). If this great and
learned general council does truly report, as I believe does. Let no man
therefore believe them that say, the Apostles did not sacrifice the^ selves,
nor none in their time, except they can prove the negative, which they shall
never do.

There be other some, that will grant the sacrifice, but deny that it is
propitiatorye for the sins of the quycke and the dead. And therefore they
disalowe the last sentence of the Mass. Where the priest says, grant good
lord, that this sacrifice which I have offered to thy divine majesty, be
propitiable or a mean to obtain mercy, to me, and to al, for whom I have
offered it. And surely these be most foolish of al, for if it be a sacrifice,
it must needs be a propitiatory sacrifice taking (propitiatory) as it ought to
be taken, not co^foundyng the meaning of it by sophistrye, but understanding
the diverse acception of ye word: but these men dally, and seduce the people
with amphibologies and doubtful sayings. Distinctions they admit none nor can
not abide to have the matter opened, and with a confuse general saying
sclaunder the church.

This is their private sophistrye, and yet they call other men sophisters, that
detecte and open their collusions, that diuyde the sentence, that men might
see, how it is true, and how it is false. For example. They cry out of this,
that we say, the Mass is a sacrifyce propitiatorye. By the word (Mass) may
be understood two things, the thing it self that is offered, and the act
of the priest in offering of it. If ye take it for the thing offered, which is
the body of Christ, who can justly deny, but that the body of Christ is a
sacrifice propitiatory, seeing saint John says, he is the propitiation for our
sins, ever was and ever shall be, and never cease so to be, till our sins
be ended, and death the last enemy be ouercomed in us his mystical body? and
as Oecumenius says: Caro Christi est propitiatorium nostrar^^ iniquitatum.
Oecume^nius in cap. 3. ad Romanos
The flesh of christ is the propitiation for our iniquities.

But if by the word (Mass) be understood the act of the priest, and the use
of the sacrament (as they would have it) then it is not propitiatorye in that
degree of propitiation, as Christ's body is, but after an other sort. And
therefore I must divide the word (propitiatory) which is taken two ways also.
First for that that worthily deserves mercy at Gods hand, and so the act of
the priest in offering, is not propitiatorye, of it self deseruyng mercy, as
Christ does.

Next for that provoke God to give mercy and remission, already deserved
by Christ. And so the oblation of the priest is propitiatory, mouyng and
prouokinge God to apply his mercy unto us. So Prayer is a sacryfyce for
sins, as Saint James says, Oration fidei saluabit infirmum, Iac. 5.
and fi in peccatis sit, remittentur ei. The Prayer of faith shall save the
sick, and if he be in sin, they shall be remitted unto him. And christ taught
us to pray thus, forgive us our trespases, as we forgive them that trepase
against us. Mat. 6.7
And also promised to give us, that we ask in CHRIST'S name,

Then ye see, that prayer being a sacrifyce, is a provocation of GOD, and a
mean to atteyne remyssion of our sins, and therefore may be well called
propitiatorye.

So is a contryte heart a Sacryfyce propitiatorye and almose, Psalm, 50,
as appeared by the story of the Ninevites and of Daniell. For all good works
yt we do, both fasting, prayer, almose, forgyuyng of my neyg^bour^ is done for
this end, to mitigate Gods anger against our sins. and to provoke him to
have mercy of us for christ's merits.

Even so the Moss (taking it for the act of the, priest) is a sacrifice
propitiatori for sin. Which I shall prove unto you by the holy fathers. Origin
writes thus. Origin. in Leuit. (...). 13.
Si referantur haec ad mysterij magnitudinem, inueni es commemorationem istam
habere ingentem repropitiationis effectum. Si redeas ad illum panem
propitiationis, quem propo suit Deus propitiationem per fi them in sanguine
eius: and si respi c^as ad illam commemoratione^ de qua dicit Dominus hoc
facit^ in meam commemorationem, inuenies quod ista est commemoratio sola quae
propitium faci at Deum. If these be referred to the greatness of our mysterye,
thou shall find that this co^memoration has a great effect of propitiation.
If ye return to that bread of propitiation, which God has set for a
propitiation by faith in his blood: and if ye look to that commemoration, of
which our Lord said, Do this in commemoratio^ of me: thou shalt find, that
this is the only commemoration that makes God merciful.

Does not saint Cyprian call the sacrament holocaustu^ Cyprian* Ser de coena.
ad purgandas iniquitates, A sacrifice to purge iniquity? in what respect is
it called so, but for that it is offered, to that end? And so is it called a
medicine to heal infirmities, for this respect that it is received to this
end.

Saint Augustyne says likewise. Augusty. Ser. 11. de sanctis.
Nemo melius praeter martyrs meruit ibi requiescere, ubi and hostia Christus
est and sacerdos scilicet, ut propitiatione^ de oblatioue hostiae consequantur.
No man has deserved better then the martyrs too rest (and be buried) there
where Christ is both the host and the priest, (that is to say under the
aultare), for this end that they might atteyne propitiation by the oblation of
ye host. Mark the purpose I bring in this for, which is to atteine
propitiation by ye oblation of ye sacrifice: and as he says in an other book.
August. Manuale. cap. 11
Sacrificium illud mirabile and coeleste quod tu instituisti and offerri
praecepistiin co^memorationem tuae charitatis mortis scilicet and passionis,
pro salute nostra, pro quotidiana fragilitatis nostrae reparatione. That
meruelouse and heavenly sacrifice, which thou haste instituted and commanded
to be offered in remembrance of thy charity, that is to say of thy death
and passion, for our health and salvation, for the daily reparation of our
frail weakness. Does he not here show the end of the oblation, to save us,
and to repair our frayltye. Saint Hierome writes Si laicis imperatur, ut
propter orationem abstineant ab uxori bus, Hieron. in cap* ^. ad* Titum
quid de Episcopo sentiendum est, qui quotidie pro suis po pulique peccatis
illibatas deo oblaturus est uictimas. If it be commanded to the lay men,
that for prayers cause they should absteyne from their wives, what should we
think of a Bishop that must offer daily pure sacrifices for his own
sins* and the peoples.

Of this place though I might prove you the chaste life of a Bishop: yet I
bring it in now only to show, that the office of a Bisshoppe is to offer
daily pure sacrifices for his own sins and the peoples sins, as saint
Basyll says in the book of his Mass. Da Domine ut pro nostris peccatis and
populi ignorantijs acceptum sit sacrificium nostrum. Basilius in Miss^*
Grant o Lord that for our sin, and the ignorance of the people our
sacrifice may be accepted of thee.

Thus ye perceive, that I have showed you, and proved that the oblation of the
priest in the Mass is a sacrifice propitiatory for the sins of the^ that be
alive, that is to say, mouyng and prouokyng god to pardonne the sins of the
priest and of the people. A little is to be said, concerning them that be
departed and then an end of that matter.

Tertullian says, Oblationes pro defunctis pro natalitijs annua die facimus*
Tertull. coron. mi lit.
We make every year oblations for the dead, and for the birth days of
martirs, which be the days they suffered their martyrdom.

Athanasius says. Intelligimus animas peccatorum participare aliqua
beneficentia ab exangui immolatione. Athanasius ad Antiochum. quest. 34.
We understand, that the souls of sinners, do receive some benefyte of the
vnbloudye oblation, and of almose, done for them, as he only has ordained
and commanded, that has power both of quycke and dead. Our god.

And Saint Ambrose exhorts the people to pray for the soul of Ualentiniane
the emperor, Ambros. de obitis Valenti.
for whom he did offer the sacrifice of christ's body. Chrisostom says*

Non frustra sancitum est ab apostolis, Chrysostom. hom. 3. ad Philip penses.
ut in celebratione uenerandorum mysterioru^ memoria fiat eorum, qui hinc
discesseruut: nouerunt illis mul tum hinc emolume^ ti fieri. etc.

It was not in vain ordained of the Apostles, that in the celebration of the
honorable mysteries, there should memory be made of them that were departed
hence. For they knew much profit, much commodity to come to them thereby.

And in an other homely he says in this manner in English. Chrysostom. hom. 41.
in. 1. cor. 15.
A sinner is departed: surely it becomes us, to be glad that his sins be
stopped and not increased, and to labor as much as we can to release him not
with weeping, In Act. hom, 21.
but with prayer, supplications, almose and sacrifices. For that was not
ordained in vain, nor we do not in vain in our holy mysteries celebrate
the memory of the dead, and make intercession for them to the lamb that lies
there, which takes away the sins of the world, but y^ some comfort may
thereby come to the^. Is not this very plain? and that it is not a thing new
invented, but a doctrine taught and used in the church ever sense Christ, and
ordained so to be done by the Apostles the^ selfs.

S. Augustyne says in his book of confessions, Augusty. confess. libro. 4.
cap. 11.
that the sacrifice of our price, which is Christ's own natural body was
offered for his mothers soul after she was dead

And he says also. De curae pro mortuis. ca. 1.
In Machabeorum libris legimus oblatum pro mortuis sacrificiu^. Sed and si
nunquam in scripturis ueteribus omnino legeretur, non parua hac consuetudine
claret authoritas ubi in praecibus Sacerdotis, quae Domino Deo a^ eius altar
funduntur, locum su um habet etiam commendatio mortuorum, In the books of the
Machabees we read, that there was sacrifi^e offered for the dead. But
although in the old scriptures there were no such thing read, yet there
appears no small authority in this custom, that among ye prayers of the
priest, which are made to our Lord God at his aultare, the commendation and
prayer for the dead has also his place.

Mark well that he says, it was an old custom in the Church for Priests
in their Mass to pray for the dead, in his time which is above eleven
hundredth and thyrtye year agoo. And that the custom of the Church in this
point is of sufficient aucthorytye too prove this matter, though there were
no scripture for it at all, and yet he him self alleges the book of
machabees for it, the place is known well enough.

He teachethe us the same thing wrytinge upon saint John. Augusty. in Joan.
tract, 84
Ideo ad ipsam mensam no^ sic eos commemoramus quemadmodum alios qui in pace
requiescunt ut etiam pro eis oremus, sed magis ut orent ipsi pro nobis, ut
eorum uestigijs inhaereamus. etc. talia enim suis fratribus exhibuerunt, qualia
de Domini mensa acceperunt.

Therefore at the very table (of the aultare) we do not so remember (the
martyrs) as we do other, other that rest in peace that we pray for them. But
rather that they should pray for us, that we might follow their fotesteppes.
For they have given such things for their brethren, as they have received
from our Lords table. Here is both prayer to saints, and for the dead in the
Mass.

Thus ye see, how Christ's body is offered for the dead, after what manner it
avails them.

Saint Augustyne also teaches, saying thus. Augusty. Enchirid. cap, 110.
When the sacrifices either of the aultare, or of any almose be offered for
the dead that were baptized, for the very good men, they be gyuynge of
thanks, for not very evil men, they be propitiations, for very evil men,
although they be no relief of the dead, yet they be certain comfortes of
them that be alive. And to them they profit, they profit to this end, either
that they should have full remission, or at least that they should have more
tolerable damnation.

In this authority is expressed the plain word of propitiatorye, how that
the sacrifice of the aultare is a propitiation for such souls, as be not
very evil or very good toward thatteynynge of full remission, or of more
tolerable damnation* If I should recyte as much as I could bring in for this
point at large: it is not one or two hours that would suffyse to the rehearsal
of the places.

By this little I have said, ye may perceive. after what sort it is true, that
the Mass is a sacrifice propitiatorye for sin, both for the quick and for
the dead.

Some think it a great blasphemye, that we should say, the priest applies
the effect of Christ's passion, to whom he lysteth, or for whom he makes
his oblation. Good people believe them not, they sclaunder us in this, for we
say not so, nor do not apply the merytes and effect of Christ's passion, to
whom we list* we do but apply our prayer and our intent of oblation,
besechynge almyghtye GOD to apply the effect of his sons passion, which is
his grace and remission of sin to them, for whom we pray. Only God
applies to us remission of sin, we but pray for it, and by the
commemoration of his sons passion provoke him to apply, so that all that we
do, is but by petition and intercession, not by authority as God does.

They say, we make oblation for messeled swyne, for sick horses, for murren
of cattle, and thus with these vile and odiouse words they go about to
bring the Mass in hatred with the simple people, that can not tell nor
judge, what it is, saying we have certain peculiar Masses for all those
things in our Mass book.

The matter of this accusation is true, but not the manner. For there be not in
our books peculiare Masses for these things, but in certain Masses there be
some peculiar prayers for these and such like things, and that by good reason.

For in the presence of Christ's body, when our prayers be most effectual,
then we pray for the atteynynge of all goodness of soul and body, and the
outward felycytye of this world is as expedient for us, according to the
will of GOD, and also we pray for the tournynge away of all euylles of body
and soul, and wordlye goods, always referrynge our selfs to his will, as he
our father thinks mete for us.

Chrysostom tells, how the priest in his Mass prays for the whole
world, Chrysostom. de sacerdotio. li. 6
for the whole city, for the sins of all men both quycke and dead, for
the ceassing of war, for the pacifyinge of sedition, for peace, and the
prosperouse estate of things, for the avoiding ofall euylles that hang over
us. For the fruits of the earth and of the sea, and such other.

Saint Augustyne in his book De ciuitate Dei tells a storye of a
gentlemanne called Hesperius, Augusty. ciuitat. li. 22. cap. ^
who having an house and grounds about it in the countreye, where his
servants and beasts were much vexed with evil spyrytes, for remedy
thereof came to saint Augustynes house, and he being absente, desired his
priests, that one of them would go to the place, and pray, that this
calamitye might cease. One of them went, and offered there the sacrifyce of
Christ's body, praynge as much as he could, that the vexation by the evil
spyrytes might cease, and by and by through the mercy of GOD it ceased.

Is not this as much, yea and more too, then we do now? Let not us
therefore fear their vile and sclaunderouse words, nor let not us cease to
do well, because they speak evil. We may not cease to do as the holy Saints
have done, because the members of the devil rail against us, as though we
did naught.

Now a little of pryuate Mass, and then make an end. Many there be, that can
well away with the Mass, but not with private Masses.

These men be deceived in their own ymagination: for there is no Mass
pryuate, but every Mass is publyke. It is called in Greek (...), a public
ministerye.

Saint Thomas calls it sometimes a pryuate Mass, but not in that respect*
as it is contrary to public, but as it is contrary too solemn.

Every Mass is public, concerning the matter and ministerye, but not
solemn concerning the place and other rytes and circumstancies.

Therefore these men speak against that they know not what. They have a new
understanding of private.

They call it a private Mass, when the priest receaueth the Sacrament alone.
And this they say is against the institution of Christ.

They say so sine fine, and never make an end, but they never prove it.

I shall show you that it is not against the institution of Christ.

The institution of Christ concerning this sacrament contains three things
which he him self did, and by his commandment gave authority to the
church to do the same. The consecration, the oblation, and the participation,

To the due consecration four things be required* the matter, form, minister
and intent.

The necessary matter is bread of wheat, which is due as it ought to be, if
it be pure, sweet and unleavened. But our new masters that cry out so fast
of Christ's institution, did ordain it should not be ministered in unleavened
bread, but in common bread, and the worse the better with them, some said
horsbread was to good. Well, there was more vilanye showed herein, than I will
express at this time.

And for ye other kind, whereas the due matter is wine mixed with water, they
notwithstanding the institution and example of our savior Christ, commanded
no water to be put in, raysynge up again the pernicious rotten and extincted
heresies which Fermentarii and Armeni^ did maintain. The form of the
sacrament is ye words of our savior Christ, saying. This is my body. This
is my blood, duelye and perfectly pronunced upon ye bread, and wine.

Our new masters yt still cry upon the institution of Christ, some said it
was a sacrament or ever the words were spoken as soon as it was brought to y^
church for ye use of the communion, some would have the words said, but as
one should read a Lesson or tell a tale, not directed to the bread and wine,
but that the Minister should look away from the bread and wine in the time
of the pronuncynge. Fearing belyke the words should have moore strength
than they would they should have.

And thus howsoever now they pretend a zeal to maintain the institution of
Christ, then they utterly destroyed the institution of Christ either deniyng or
defraudinge the necessary consecration of the sacrament.

The minister ought only to be a priest duelye consecrated and ordereed after
the rite of the Catholic church, whose ministration god only does assiste.
These men did not only maintain yt it was lawful, but also did appoynte and
permit mere lay men to minister, yea and lay women somtymes, as some said,
without any lawful vocation or ordering at al, not regarding what Arnobius
writes Quid tam magnificum quam sacramenta dei co^ficere? Arnobius in ps. 139.
et quid tam perniciosum, quam si is ea conficiat qu^ nulum sacerdotij gradum
accipit. What is so excellent than to consecrate ye sacraments of god? and
what is so perniciouse, than if he consecrate them, that has received no degree
of priesthode? The intent also to do that the church does without mocking
dissimulation or contrary purpose is required. For although the priest in the
consecration may have his thoughts distracte to some other thing, and so
lack attention, which is a great negligence in the work of God, and deadly
sin to ye minister: yet if he lack intention not intendyng to do that God
commands and the church does: there is no consecration nor no sacrament at
all. And for this point what intention shall we think these men had of late
that utterly dinied to consecrate or receive Christ's body and blood under
the forms of bread and wine, but only to receive the creatures of bread and
wine, and thereby to be pertakers of Christ's body and blood? For in the book
of their last communion, these were the words of the invocation. Good lord
grant us that we receiving these thy creatures of bread and wine, according to
thy sons institution, may be partakers of his body and blood*

Was there ever heard of any such institution? Look throughout all the
scripture and show me where ever Christ did institute, that by eatinge of
bread and wine, men should be partakers of his body and blood. And if it can
not be showed, as I am sure it can not: than it was a plain forged lie bearing
me^ in hand that Christ instituted that he never thought, whereby appears yt
they had not this intention which is required to ye due co^secratio^: and also
yt they in words prete^dinge to have a zeal to maintain Christ's institution,
i^ their deeds showed themselves enemies and adversaries to ye same* And as
they used themselves in consecration: so they did in the oblation, which they
did not corrupt as the other, but utterly took away, deniynge any such
thing to be, as I have proved it is, in so much that in all their new
communion, they could not scarcely abide the name or word of oblation, but
pulled it out of the book, so much did they favor the instituton of Christ
which they now pretend.

Now when they have taken away the due matter, as sweet unleavened bread, ye
meixture of the chalice, and perverted the form by leauyng out the principal
verb ( est) in the words of Christ, as it was in ye last book in the first
pryntyng, how it came in again I can not tell, and neglected the due
ordering of the minister, sufferyng them to usurp the office of a priest that
never received that authority, neither of God nor man, and in that they did
(which was very bad) never intended to do as the church does, and whollye
did abrogate as much as laid in the^ the oblation of Christ's body in
remembrance of his passion, and at length would have nothing to remain, but
a bare communion, what face have they to cry upon Christ's institution,
institution, which they have in so many points broken and violated as I have
showed? and yet yt they would have is no part of Christ's institu^ion.

For the use of the sacrament is yt it should be received and eaten, and
therefore in diverse counsels it was decreed that whosoever ever took the
sacrament at the priests hand and did not eat it, Conciliu^ toletanu^ prim.
ca. 14. Co^ci* caesar. aug. Capi. 3.
for the which end Christ did ordain it, was holden accursed and
excommunicate. Thus far exte^deth y^ institution of Christ concerning this
point, because he said Accipite, manducate et bibite. Take, eat, drink, and
also that all should eat, and drink of it, that could prove themselves
(after S. Paul's admonition).

But such things as pertayne to the Ceremonye of the eating, as, how many
in one place together, what time, place, manner, order and such like, be
things pertaining to the ordinance and direction of the church, and not to
the institution of Christ, as necessary upon pain of damnation to be
observed of every christen man.

For else if all the rytes that Christ used at his supper were of necessity and
pertaynyng to his institution: then there must needs be thyrtene together at
the communion and neither moo nor fewer.

And it must be celebrate after supper, and in the night, after the washing of
the fete, and in a parler or chamber, and all that receive must be priests and
no women. For all these things were observed of Christ and his apostles at his
last supper.

But for our instruction to declare that they be not fixed by the institution
of Christ, but left to the disposition of ye church, ye church has taken an
other order in these things, willing that all shall communicate that be
worthy and disposed. So that the number whether there be many or few, or but
one in one place that receive, makes not the ministration of the priest for
that thing unlawful.

And it has ordered that it shall be celebrate in the morning, and received
fasting before all other meats, and in the church, except necessite other wise
require. And therefore S. Augustine taught Ianuarius. after this sort. Augusti
epist. 118
Ideo saluator non praecepit, quo deinceps ordine sumeretur, ut apostolis per
quos dispositurus erat ecclesia^ seruaret hunc locu^. Therefore our Saluiour
did not commau^de by what order it should be received after him, but reserved
that matter to the apostles by whom he would order and dispose his church*

By this we may conceive that the receyuynge of the sacrament is Christ's
institution, but the manner, number and other rites of the receyuynge be not
determined by Christ's institution, but ordered at the Churches disposition.

Yet say they, Christ did not receive it alone, but did communicate with his
twelve apostles, whose example we ought to follow. To this I say* that we be
not bounden to follow this example for the number, but for the substance. That
it should be received of us, is Christ's example necessary, but of how many,
of twelve only, of mo, of fewer, or of one, is not by Christ's example fixed
and determined.

Christ ministryng the mystical supper of necessity, and that never but ones,
for this end, by his deed to institute the thing, and to teach his disciples
what they should do continuallye afterward in commemoration of his death,
must needs have ministered it to mo then him self, because in that doing he
gave them authority to do the same, and so made them priests. But we
ministrynge it not for that intent to institute the Sacrament, and to make
Priests, but to receive the spirtuall fruit that comes to us thereby, are
not bounden to observe that number, but shall ^doe well if we receive it either
with other or alone.

We read even from the beginning of the church, that lay men and women did
receive it alone, and is there any religion that a lay man may do it, but
not a priest? Turtuliane declares the difficulty for a christen wife to
observe her religion without offense that has an infidele to her husband,
among other things says thus. Non sciet maritus quid secreto ante omnem
cibum gustes? Tertualianus ad uxorem.
et si sciuerit, panem, non illum credit esse qui dicitur.

Will not thy husband know, what thou do eat secretlye before all other
meats? And if he do know, he believes it is bread and not him whom it is
called. Of this place we gather the manner of the church in that time, shortly
after Christ, that the people receiving the Sacrament at the priests hand in
the Church, did carye it home with them, and kept it secretlye and deuoutlye
at home with them selfs, and every morning as their devotion served them, did
receive a part of it by them selfs, and that secretly, lest the infideles
among whom they dwelt should get knowledge of our mysteries. And thus of
this place of Tertulliane, like as we may learn, that the Sacrament is not
bread, as the infideles believe, if they chance to se it: but Christ as it is
called, as y^ faithful only know, to be so: so we learn also, that men and
women were wont to receive it alone without any other company assembled with
the^, which is sufficient for our purpose at this time. Saint Cypriane tells
of a womanne in these words. Cyprian. de lapsis.
Cum quaedam arcam suam in qua domini sanctu^ fuit manibus indignus tentasset
a^erire, igne inde surgente deterrita est, ne auderet attingere, When a
certain woman went about to open her cheste, wherein was the holy one of
GOD with unworthy hands, she was affrayd for the fire that rose from thence,
that she durst not touch it. By this place appears the like manner of keeping
it at home to receive it alone at their pleasure. And Eusebius in his storye
tells, that the manner was to send the sacrament to Bisshops strangers,
Eusebius histor. eccles. lib. ^ cap. 22.
y^ chanced to come thither for this end, to know whether they were Catholic
and of their faith or no, which they knew, if they would receive the sacrament
which they had consecrate. And also he tells of one yt lay in extreme
peril of death, Lib. 6, ca 34,
who had committed ydolatry before, and sent to ye priest for ye sacrament,
whereby he might be reconciled to the church, before he died, the priest was
also sick and could not come, but sent it by the sick man's servant, and so
forth. Here it is plain, that lay men received it alone without the
priest. And what great religion is there now new found out, that the
priest may not likewise receive it alone, if the people be not worthy nor
disposed at al times to communicate with him.

I leave out a great number of places that make for the reservation of the
Sacrament, which al make for this purpose, if I would spend any time herein
to declare it. Well, some will say, here be doctors upon doctors, sentencies
of aucthors enough. But what scripture have you, that the priest did or may
take it alone? show me that, and then will I yield unto you.

I shall be content to allege scripture, as it seems to me, let every man weye
it as he thinks good, to me it is plain enough for this purpose, and
although there were no scripture, yet in this matter which is but a ceremony,
concerning the number of the receauers, the custom and use of Christ's
church, is a sufficient rule for a Christen man to stay him self by.

The scripture is written in the.27. chapter of the Acts of the Apostles,
Act. 27,
where S. Paul comfortynge all the company, that were with him in ye ship,
who then were in extreme danger of drownynge, promisynge them all their life's,
and exhorting them to take meat, that had fasted fourtenne days before
received the sacrament before them all alone, as I take it. The words be
these. Et cum haec dixisset, sumens pane^ gratias egit deo in conspectu omnium,
et cum fregisset, coepit manducare. Animaequiores autem facti omnes, and ipsi
sumpserunt cibum And when he had said this, taking bread, he gave thanks to
God in the sight of them all, and when he had broken it, he began to eat,
and they al being much comforted, took meat also. Chrysostom expounds
this place of the Sacrament, Chrysostom. in Matthew hom. 17.
where he has this saying, yt it is not only a thing sanctified, but
sanctification it self. Here is no mention that he gave it to any other, and
if it had been a thing necessary of the institution of Christ, belike he
would have expressed it. Well though it be not expressed in words (say they)
yet it is not a necessary argument to conclude, that no man received it
with him. I grant it is not a good argument, but yet this is the commen manner
of their reasonynge, it is not expressed in scripture, ergo it is not to be
believed. But I can say more for this place, for the scripture calls, that
saint Paul eat, ((...)) which is a word, whereby the Sacrament is commonly
expressed, and that all the other did eat ((...)) which signifies commen
meats, and the scripture says (omnes) al ye other took their meat, among
whom there were many infideles, and it says afterward, satiati cibo, yt they
were satiate and full with meat. But the blessed Sacrament non est cibus
satietatis, sed sancti moniae (as Conciliu^ Nicenu^) says* Conciliu^ Nicenum
is not meat of satiety, but of sanctimony. Therefore where it says that saint
Paul did eat the bread, which is the sacrament, and that all the other did
fill the^ with their commen meat. I may conclude, that saint Paul did
receive alone, whereby is proved our purpose of the private Mass, as they term
it. O Lord how would they have gloried, if they had such alyke place against
us*

Some bring in a place of Chrysostom, Chrysostom. hom. 61. ad popul. Antioche
number..
where he says, frustra sacrificium quotidianum, frustra stamus ad altar,
nullus qui communicet, Our daily sacrifice is in vain, we stand at the
aultare in vain no man comes to communicate.

O Lord how they abuse this place of Chrysostom, that he says to rebuke
the negligence of the people that comes not, they allege it to find fault at
the diligence of the priest that comes. It is reason, that the priest whose
life is wholly dedicate to the service of God, and to pray for the people,
should sin deadly, if he did join him self more and more to Christ by
receauyng daily the spiritual food of his body and blood, because the people
that co^monlye occupye their life in the affairs of the world be not worthy,
or not disposed daily to receive with the priest*

The very place it self of Chrysostom tells, that the priests did
celebrate the sacrifice daily, whether the people came or no, which they would
never have done, if it had been deadly sin so to do. Therefore it is plain,
yt they did sacrifice, they did stand at ye aultare, and cried, but al in vayn,
Sancta sanctis Holy things to holy men, Cu^ timore and charitate d^i
accedite. Come up to receive with the fear of God and charity, and yet no man
came. Therefore all this his homelye was too reprove the slackenes of the
people, that deceived the expectation of the priest.

I put the case (as I have seen it chance) that when the priest had
consecrate, and one or two were commed up to the aultare, and kneled down to
communicate with the priest after the priest had received, they both departed and
went away, not receiving either of contempt, or for that some sodeyne disease
or passion came upon the^ yt they could not receive: is God so unmerciful as
to condemn the priest for the casualty of an other man which lies not in his
power to avoid? Our salvation were a very tykle thing, if one man should
commit deadly sin against his will intendinge to serve God, and so be
condemned for the chance of an other man which he could not stop or amend,
and was no cause of it. Yea but (say they) Chrisostom says. Non es hostia
dignus nec communione, igitur nec oratione.

If a man make his excuse, that he is not worthy the sacrifice, nor to
communicate, then is he not worthy to be present there at the prayer. He says
so in deed. But what is this, to that the priest should not receive alone?
nothing at all. And yet it serves us to declare, that Chrysostom intended
nothing else, but to reprove the negligence of them, that stood in the place
of the worthy receauers, and would not come to receive.

We must considre in the greek church, how there was certain degrees of the
placyng of the people, the priest stood at ye aultare* the clerks within the
chauncell, the worthy receauers, in a distinct place beside the priests, the
penitentes in a lower place, the Catechumeni which were men, learning our
faith, and not yet Christened sat loweste of all, but they were put out of
the Church, when the sermon and teaching was done, and were not suffered to be
present at ye mysteries. Now the lack that men do not understand the
distinction of these several places, makes them too take Chrysostom wrong*
For in deed he that is in the higher place of the communicantes, and being
there thinks him self for his unclean life not worthy to communicate, and
so deceaueth the expectation of the priest that prepares for him: is likewise
not worthy to communicate in only prayer, as being in yt place, and yet has
most need of al to communicate in prayer, because prayer is an humility of y^
mind and a cause and degree to make a man worthy to communicate in the
sacrament. And therefore by Chrysostom he is not forbid to communicate in
prayer, but not in that place, but lower among the penitentes. For so
Chrysostom says by and by after. Quot quot estis in poenite^tia, omnes orate.
All you that be penitentes, occupye your selfs in prayer. And it was a decree
of ye whole catholic church, yt certain men which were not suffered to
communicate in the sacrament, should during their penance communicate only in
prayer. These be the words of the general council at Nice in English.
Conciliu^ Nicenun^ cap. 12.
Concerning them that had committed ydolatrye and were in penance not yet
reconciled, and now be departinge out of their bodies, let the old canon be
observed, that he that is departing, be not defrauded of the necessary vitayle
of life, but if any such after he have received the communion, do recover and
amend, let them remain among them that communicate only in prayer. We may
see by this, that the meaning of Chrysostom is, as I have declared. Other
make an argument of the word Communio that the sacrament is called a
communion, because many received it. But this argument is unlearned,
proceadyng of ignorance. For it is so called, not for that many communicate
together in one place, but for ye effect of the sacrament, because it makes
many diverse men one mistical body of Christ.

So does Chrysostom expound it, writing upon the 10. chapter to the
Corinthians And also Dionisius Areopagita says, Vnde merito sacerdotalis
sacrosancta prudentia ex rerum effectu proprium illi uerumque (communicationis)
cognomen inuenit. Dionisius Areop. eccles. hierar. cap. 3
Therefore the holy wisdom of the priests has worthelye invented to this
sacrament a propre and true name of communion, for the effect of it, because it
gathers our life's yt be divided a sunder many ways, into yt one state,
whereby we are joined to god and among our selves in one body, and so forth.

And in very deed we do not communicate alone. For considering gods church is
but one house, as Cypriane says, Vna est domus ecclesiae, in qua agnus editur.
Cyprian. de cena.
There is one house of the church, wherein the lamb is eaten: whosoever does
eat this lamb worthelye, does communicate with al christen men in every place
and country that be in this house and do the like.

If the pryest receive one part of the sacrament in the church, and afterward
carry the rest two or three miles to a sick man, does he not communicate with
another? and yet that other is not together with him in one place, standing at
his elbow. Even so the priest that says mass alone, does communicate with al
the^ yt celebrate in other churches, or in other realms. This argument of
Communion was never ^eard of in the world before Martyne Luther, who was ye
first father of it, and the first man that ever wrote against private masses as
he calls the^*

And where learned Luther that lesson? even of the devil not because al evil
comes by the suggestion of the devil, but I mean yt Luther had a vision of
the devil and saw him with his corporal eye being wakyng, of whom he learned
all that he has pestilently spoken against the holy mass. And lest men should
say I lied upon Luther, here is his own book, Ex orete iudico, serve nequam.
We may Judge him by his own mouth and his own hand writynge. The title of
his book is of private mass. I shall read you a piece of it that the truth of
my saying may appear. These be his very words.

I shall make confession before all you reuende and holy fathers, give me I
pray you a good absolution. It chanced me once about midnight suddenly to
awake, than the devil Satan began with me this disputation. Hear (said he)
doctor Luther, very well learned, thou know thou have said private masses
xv. years almost daily. What if such private masses be horrible ydolatry? what
if there were not present the body and blood of Christ, but thou had
honored only bread and wine, and had caused other to honor it? to who^ I
answered, I am an anointed priest, and have received unction and consecration
of a bishop, and have done al these things by commandment and obedience of
mine elders* Why should not I consecrate, when I have pronu^ced ye words of
Christ and have said mass i^ earnest? this thou know. All this said he is
true, but ye turks and gentiles do likewise al things in their temples of
obedience and in earnest

The priests of Hieroboam did all they did of a certain zeal and intent
against the true priests in Jerusalem*

What if they ordering and consecratynge were false, as the priests of the
Turks and Samaritans were false and their service of god false and wicked?
First (said he) thou know thou had than no knowledge of Christ, nor true
faith, and for faith thou waste no better than a Turk.

For the Turk and all the deuyls also believe the storye of Christ, that he was
borne crucified, and dead* etc. But the Turk and we dampened sprites do not
trust to his mercy, nor have not him for a mediator and savior, but fear
him as a cruel judge.

Such a faith and no other had thou, when thou receyuest unction of ye
bishop and al other both they yt did annoynct, and were annoyncted, thought
so and no other wise of Christ* Therefore ye fled from Christ as a cruel
judge to blessed Mary and ye saints, they were mediators between you and
Christ. Thus was Christ robbed of his glory* This neither thou nor no other
papist can deny. I would read more of this book but for troubling you. He yt
ly^t to know what may be said against private mass, let him learn here of
ye devil enough

For here is all that has yet been said of any other, and more to. The deuyls
derlinges were ashamed to say half so much as their father Satan, lest they
should be called blasphemous liars as he is.

But by this book, Luthers own confession set forth in prynt by him self to
ye world, ye may know that the devil was the first yt ever barked against
ye sacrifice of the church, which is the mass, knowing that his kingdom of
sin and iniquity could not stand, if this sacrifice most adversary to it,
were not defaced and destroyed.

But what color had Luther to publishe this, shall we think he was so mad
as to father that upon the devil, that he would have persauded for truth to
the world? I shall tell you shortly his fond deuyse in this point, as it
follows five or six leaves here after.

He says he knows the devil is a liar, but (he says) his lies be craftye,
he uses to allege a truth which can not be denied, and with that to color
his lie which he persaudeth.

And therefore (says he) the devil lies not when he accuses, as that I had
committed horrible Idolatry in saying private masses: but the lie is when he
did afterward tempt him to despair of gods mercy. But says Luther I will not
despair as Judas did, but amend that I have done amysse and never say
private mass again.

O what a cloak of mischief is this, and al grounded of lies and falshode, He
says the devil lies not when he accuses. If that be true, then he said true
when he said that Luther being a preacher many years, never had true faith
in Christ till he fell from the mass, nor never trusted in Christ's mercy, nor
never took him for a savior but a cruel judge, Of this the devil did accuse
him, whether he was a liar herein or no judge you.

Also in his accusation he said the body and blood of Christ were not present
in the sacrament, when such annoyncted priests did consecrate, and that they
honored only bread and wine, with many other damnable lies and heresies,
which whosoever shall read the book, may find in great plenty, and yet by
Luthers principle, the devil never lies when he accuses. Now because ye time
is far past, shortly to conclud, I shall most humblye beseech you to consider
and regard the salvation of your souls, for the which Christ Gods son
has shed his preciouse blood which salvation can not be attained wtoute
knowledge and confession of gods truth reveled to his holy church, and by her
to every membre of her, and child of god, whose sentence and determination is
sure and certain, as procedinge from the pyller of truth and the spirit of
god, by who^ we be taught and assured in gods own word, that in ye blessed
sacrament of the altar* by the power of the holy ghost working with gods word,
is verily and really present the body and blood of our savior Christ, under
the forms of bread and wine, which is by Christ's own commandment and
example offered to almightye god in sacrifice, in commemoration of Christ's
passion and death, whereby the members of the church in whose faith it is
offered, both they that be alive, and departed, perceive plentuouse and
abundaunt grace and mercy, and in all their necessities and calamities releife
and succur*

Our most merciful father grant us to persist steadfast and constant in the
true catholic faith and confession of this most blessed Sacrament and
sacrifice, and with pure devotion as he has ordained to use and frequent this
holy misterye of unity and reconsiliation, that we may thereby remain in him
and he in us for evermore. To whom be all glory and praise with out end.

AMEN.
