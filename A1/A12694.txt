(...) (...) (...) Spare your good


EVen about the month of may
I wene it was the third day
Of that same month as I guess
And so it was so have I bless
For I know it well by a thing
Of the which I have had knowledgynge
As here after ye shall hear full well
Of a knights sone how it befell
A rich knight there was in France I vnderstan^
And was a man of great land
and hight sir Thomas perlore
a sone he had with his wife and no more
And she was called fair Ysaungrayne
and their sone called Rafelyne
and of this child ye shall hear
and of his father and his mother dear
Of his father he was lefe and dear
So was he of his mother I you ensere
So it happened upon a day
That this young man should sport and play
His father bade him go among wise men
That he might learn some good of them
But this yunge man him bethought
That after his fathers counsel he would do nougt
But to ill company he him drew
and learned all vice and left virtue
Till father and mother were dead
Than could he none other read
But burye them after the comune use
Other sorrow would he none use
But forth he went to his company anon
and said sirs let us be merry euerychone
Sir they said welcome be ye truly
and we all pray you heartily
To sit by us and keep company
So he did and thanked them hertely
They called anon for meat and drink of the best
For to eat and drink as them lest
and when they had eaten and dronken their fill
Sir they said know ye nothing of our will
No by my faith he said incontinente
But by saint Thomas of kente
I would have at the hasarde a cast or two
For to learn to cast the dyce to and fro
and if here be any body that will for money play
I have yet in my purse money and pledges gaye
Some be nobles, some be crowns of France
Have at all who will of this dance
One of them answered with that word
and cast a bale of dyce on the board
and said master Rafeleyne will ye have a fytre
Have at all if ye will sytte
Master Rafeleyne drew to his pouche
Till he had lost coin and o w^che
Than he drew out pledges fresshe and gaye
Till all was gone and played away
home he goes like as he were out of his mind
and sold al his goods before and behind
and to harlotes he goes and to baudes bold
For he thought his money should ever hold
To the tavern and to the bordell he h^ndrest
For all that his fellowship d^d counsel him for the best
But at the la^te when all was gone
Than he began to make his moan
L^ke as here after ye shall understand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand.
Thus ends the prolo^ue
ALas my good is spente I have no more
Therefore I am troubled sore
with great greuaunce in my heart rote
To spend a pound was but a small note
Like as I was used to do here and there
Therefore I must now mirth forbear
Which here before I did not understand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand.
What shall I now begin to do alace
Here before I might go in every place
With the best where so ever they went
unto the wine, to the good ale, or to ye bear al vnshe^t
But for because give no more I may
Must I be cast out of al game and play
In my greuaunce is no remedy I understand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand
What avails it me to cry or to complain then
When my friends and also my kynnesmen
May neither se me nor hear me
Therefore think I of the^ but little comforted to be
Thus have I spente al my good out right
^y^h playenge, with drinking day and night
which every wise man will not do I understand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand.
Never I could perce^ue this great charge
But my lust has brought me in this rage
The which I begin no^ to understand
That money is lord of all the land
For because I have not had this in remembrance
Therefore poverty and miserye is tall to my chance
And am taken of no value I understand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand
I see that they with fingers point after me
The which here before were used to praise me
And they let me pass by the door
The which I have kept good fellowship to fore
They mock with me which I was wont^ to trime
May not I have great repentance of this lust
Ye and must suffer this I understand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand
When I was young and had good at will
And every body eat and drancke with me their fill
Than they did call me in every place
Now they think I am not worth a lace
Pouertye has taken me with great sorrow
I have nothing nor can nothing borow
Thus have I but ill fortune I understand
therefore spare your good that ye have in hand
^ue thought in my mind
Could I any good get or find
I would not cast it away every del^
Like as my fellowship did my counsel
When I was used to bear money be my side
I thought not that it should thus from me slide
Thus was I not wise I understand
Therefore spare your good that you have in hand
Might I yet that day live
That my friends would me give
Some thing where with all
I might get richesse and honest princypall
I would thank them now and than among
But certes my thinks they tarry to long
Therefore I must suffer be it sweet or sour I understand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand
When any body has any richesse
Every body him worshippeth both more and less
But and he have nothing in value
He is nothing set by perdue
And if he come hither or else where
Every body flees from him as he the devil were
Full often changes his courage I understand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand.
He that has nothing is taken of no value
And will not do after good counsel perdue
Like as of me ye may example take
How of riot and other games was used to make
Who so ever in the world if riot me bethought
I could it lightly help for to be wrought
which is now bitter it was than sweet at that stand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand
Wherefore should not I take now sorrow again
Ye certes there is none that will me any thing lene
Even thus the whele of fortune renneth
And if good luck did tame I sholude not be wete
If it be good luck or ill hap
It comes to him that shall have it at a clappe
Every body may se by me in this stand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand
A man may well a good fellow be
In the wine, in good ale, in bear where so it be
and if he think for the comune profit also
Here or there where so ever he go
Thus may a man haunte mirth and gain
If he do it not by measure he is to blame
For in every thing measure is good I understand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand
Farewell I set you all this testamente
Who will learn this shall be vnshente
and can keep him among good company
Shall be fre of al sorrow and myserye
Who so ever takes this testamente in remembrance
Pouertye and myserye shall not fall to his chance
His good his worship shall he keep I understand
Therefore spare your good that ye have in hand
FINIS
I Here ends a little tre^tyse very profitable for every young man and young
woman called Syrs spare your good.
