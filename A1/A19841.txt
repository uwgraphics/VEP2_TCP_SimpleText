SONGS FOR THE LVTE VIOL and Voice: Composed by I. Danyel, Batchelar in
Music. 1606. To Mris Anne Grene.

LONDON Printed T. E. for Thomas Adams, At the sign of the white Lion, in
Paul's Churchyard.



To Mrs Anne Grene the worthy Daughter to Sr William Grene of Milton Knight.
THat which was only privately composed,
For your delight, Fair Ornament of Worth;
Is here, come, to be publicly disclosed:
And to an universal view put forth.
Which having been but yours and mine before,
(Or but of few besides) is made hereby
To be the worlds: and yours and mine no more.
So that in this sort giving it to you,
I give it from you, and therein do wrong,
To make that, which in private was your due:
Thus to the world in common to belong.
And thereby may debase the estimate,
Of what perhaps did bear some price before:
For often we see how things of slender rate,
Being vndiuulg'd, are choisely held in store:
And rarer compositions once exposed,
Are (as unworthy of the world) condemned:
For what, but by their having been disclosed
To all, has made all mysteries contemned.
And therefore why had it not been ynow,
That Milton only heard our melody?
Where Baucis and Philoemon only show,
To Gods and men their hospitality:
And thereunto a joyful ear afford,
In midst of their well welcomed company:
Where we (as Birds do to themselves record)
Might entertain our private harmony.
But fearing least that time might have beguild
You of your own, and me of what was mine,
I did desire to have it known my Child:
And for his right, to others I resign.
Though I might have been warned by him, who is
Both near and dear to me, that what we give
Unto these times, we give t'vnthankfulnesse,
And so without unconstant censures, live.
But yet these humors will no warning take,
We still must blame the fortune that we make.
And yet herein we do adventure now,
But Air for Air, no danger can accrue,
They are but our refusalls we bestow,
And we thus cast the old to have room for new:
Which I must still address t'your learned hand,
Who me and all I am, shall still command.
John Danyel.

^ COy Daphne fled from Phoebus hot pur- suite, Careless of ^ Pas- sion,
sense- less of Remorse: Whilst he com- plained his griefs, she rested ^
mute, He begged her stay, She still kept on her course, But what re- ward she
had for this ^ you see, She rests trans- formed, a win- ter beaten tree. She
rests transformed, ^ ij. She rests trans- formed a winter bea- ten tree. ^

1. BASSO.
^ COy Daphne fled: ^

Coy Daphne fled from Phoebus hot pursuit,
Careless of Passion, senseless of Remorse:
Whilst he complained his griefs she rested mute*
He begged her stay, she still kept on her course.
But what reward she had for this you see,
She rests transformed a winter beaten tree.
The Answer.
Chaste Daphne fled from Phoebus hot pursuit,
Knowing men's passions Idle and of course:
And though he plained it was fit she should be mute*
And honor would she should keep on her course*
For which fair deed her Glory still we see,
She rests still Green, and so wish I to be.
II* BASSO.
^ THou pretty Bird: ^

II* CANTO.
^ THou pretty Bird how do I see, thy sil-ly state and mine a- gree, ^ For thou
a prisoner art, so is my heart, Thou sing'st to her and so do I address my ^
Music to her ear, that is merci- less. But here-in does, here- in does the
dif- ference lie, ^ that thou art graced, so am not I: Thou singing live,
singing, singing, singing live, and I must ^ sing- ing dye. But herein, etc. ^

Thou pretty Bird how do I see,
Thy silly state and mine agree:
For thou a prisoner art,
So is my heart*
Thou sing'st to her and so do I address,
My Music to her ear that is merciless:
But herein does the difference lie,
That thou art graced so am not I,
Thou singing live, and I must singing die.
III. BASSO.
^ He whose desires: ^

III. CANTO.
^ HE whose de- sires are still are still a- broad I see, And therefore now
come back come back my heart to me, ^ has never a- ny peace at home the while.
Rest a-lone, rest a-lone it is but for su- perfluous things we toil. Honor
wealth, honor wealth ^ with thy self be all with- in, For what with- out thou
get'st, thou do not glo- ry fame are no such things, But that which from I-
ma- gi- nati- on ^ win. High reaching power that seems to o- uer grow, does
creep but springs ^ on the earth, lies base and low. ^

He whose desires are still abroad I see,
Has never any peace at home the while:
And therefore now come back my heart to me,
It is but for superfluous things we toil,
Rest alone with thy self be all within,
For what without thou get'st thou do not win.
Honor, wealth, glory, fame, are no such things,
But that which from Imagination springs.
High reaching power that seems to over grow,
Does creep but on the earth, lies base and low*
IIII. CANTO.
^ LIke as the Lute delights, delights, or else, or ^ else dis- likes, as is
his art that plays upon the same: So sounds my Muse, ^ ij. it founds
accordings as she strikes, On my heart strings high tuned, high ^ tuned un- to
her fame. Her touch does cause the war- ble of the sound, which ^ here I yield
in lamentable wise: ij. in lamentable wise: la- men- ^ ta- ble wise: A way-
ling descant ij. on the ^ ^ sweet- est ground, Whose due reports, ij. gives ho-
nour to her eyes, Whole ^ due re- ports, ij. gives honor to her eyes, if a- ny
plea- sing, ^ relish here I use, Judge then the world her beauty the same, ^

IIII. BASSO.
LIke as the Lute: ^

IIII. CANTO.
^ same, Else harsh my style, vntuna-ble my Muse hoarse sounds, The voice that
pray- seth ^ not her name, For no ground else, for no ground else could make
the Music ^ such, Not other hand could give so sweet a touch, could give so
sweet a ^ touch. For no, etc. ^

IIII. BASSO.
^

Like as the Lute delights or else dislikes,
As is his art that plays upon the same:
So sounds my Muse according as she strikes
On my heart strings, high tuned unto her same.
Her touch does cause the warble of the sound,
Which here I yield in lamentable wise:
A wayling descant on the sweetest ground,
Whose due reports gives honor to her eyes.
If any pleasing relish here I use,
Then Judge the world her beauty gives the same:
Else harsh my style untunable my Muse,
Hoarse sounds the voice that praises not her name.
For no ground else could make the Music such,
Nor other hand could give so sweet a touch.
V. BASSO.
^ Do thou withdraw: ^

V. CANTO.
^ Do. do thou withdraw thy grace, Do, ^ O do thou withdraw thy grace,
Because I should not love, and think thou to remove m'a- ^ fections with thy
face? As if that love did hold no part, But where thy beau- tie Ah yes it is
more, more is de-sire, There where it wounds and ^ lies: And were not in my
heart, Great-er then in thy fair eyes? Ah yes it is, etc. pines, As fire is far
more fire, Where it burns then where it shines. ^

Do thou withdraw thy grace,
For that I should not love:
And think thou to remove,
M'affeictions with thy face?
As if that love did hold no part,
But where thy beauty lies:
And were not in my heart,
Greater then in thy fair eyes?
Ah yes it is more, more is desire,
There where it wounds and pines:
As fire is far more fire,
Where it burns then where it shines?
VI. BASSO.
^ WHY can thou not, etc. ^

VI. CANTO.
^ WHY can thou not as others do, Look on me with vnwounding eyes? ^ And
yet look sweet, but yet not so, Smile but not in killing wise. Arm not thy
graces ^ to confou^d, Only look, ij. Only look but do not wound. ij. ^
Only look, ij. ij. ij. but do not wound. Only look but do not wound. ^

Why can thou not as others do?
Look, on me with vnwounding eyes:
And yet look sweet but yet not so,
Smile but, not in killing wise.
Arm not thy graces to confound,
Only look but do not wound.
Why should mine eyes see more in you,
Then they can see in all the rest:
For I can others beauties view,
And not find my heart oppressed.
O be as others are to me,
Or let me, be more to thee.
VII. CANTO.
^ STay cruel, stay, Pit- tie mine anguish, And if I languish ^ For that which
you do bear a- way, Ah how can you be so un- kind, As not to grieve for ^
that you leave behind, And if you will go ij. yet let your pity stay, yet let
your pity ^ stay, and if you will go, and if you will go, yet let your
pity stay, yet O let your pity stay. ^ But will you go? say will you? O
will you go and show that you neglect, that ^ you neg- lect me, Yet say
farewell, ij. ij. farewell. ij. ij. ^

VII. BASSO.
^ STay Cruel stay:

Stay Cruel stay,
Pity mine anguish,
And if I languish
For that which you do bear away,
Ah, how can you be so unkind,
As not to grieve for that you leave behind,
And if you will go, yet let your pity stay,
But will you go and show that you neglect me?
Yet say farewell, and seem but to respect me.
^ Yet say fare-wel, and seem but to re- spect, O seem but to re- spect me.
Yet say, etc. ^

VIII. CANTO.
^ TIme cru- ell Time can thou sub- due that B^ow? Or art thou grown in
league with those faire' eyes? ^ That conquers all but thee and thee t^o
stays? as if she were ij. That they might aid thee to con- sum our days,
or do thou love ij. ^ exempt from Scieth or Bow, From Love and years un-
sub- iect her for her cru- el- ties, Being mer- ci- less like thee that ^ to
de- cayes? Then do so still although she makes no no man ways? And do so
still although she no- thing ^ steeme, Of days nor years but lets them run
in vain, Hold still thy swift cares, Do as I do love her al-though un-
leinde, Hold still yet O ^

VIII. BASSO.
^ Time cruel time:

Time cruel time can thou subdue that brow,
That conqueres all but thee, and thee too stays:
As if she were exempt from seyeth or bow,
From Love and years vnsubiect to decays.
Or art thou grown in league with those fair eyes,
That they might help thee to consume our days,
Or do thou love her for her cruelties,
Being merciless like thee that no man ways?
Then do so still although she makes no steeme,
Of days nor years, but lets them run in vain:
Hold still thy swiftwing'd hours that wondering seem
To gase on her, even to turn back again.
And do so still although she nothing cares,
Do as I do, love her although unkind,
Hold still, yet O I fear at unawares,
Thou will beguile her though thou seem so kind.
^ winged hours that won- dring seem, To gase on her even to turn I fear at
un- a- wares, Thou will be- guile her though thou ^ back a- gain. And do so,
etc. seem so kind. ^

Ears hear no more, for what can breath the voice of true Delight?
Cloth thee my heart, with dark black thoughts, and think but of despair,
Silence lock up my words, and scorn these Idle sounds of Air.
Think Glory, Honor, Joys, Delights, Contents,
Are but the empty reports
Of vnappropried terms that breath inuents,
Not knowing what it imports.
But Sorrow, Grief, Affliction, and Despair,
These are the things that are sure,
And these we feel not as conceyts in the air,
But as the same we endure.
Joys, delights, and pleasures in us hold such a doubtful part,
As if they were but thrall,
And those were all in all,
For Griefs, Distrusts, Remorce, I see must domineere the heart.
Joys, Delights, and Pleasures, makes grief to tiranize us worse,
Our mirth brings but distastes:
For naught delights and lastes,
Grief then take all my heart, for where none strive there needs less force.

misdeedes, ij. and I vnthinke my sin, How free, how clear, how clean my ^

IF I could shut the gate against my thoughts,
And keep out sorrow from this room with-in:
Or memory could cancel all the notes,
Of my misdeeds and I vnthink my sin,
How free, how clear, how clean my soul should lie,
Discharged of such a loathsome company.
Or were there other rooms without my heart,
That did not to my conscience join so near,
Where I might lodge the thoughts of sin apart,
That I might not their claim'rous crying hear.
What peace, what Joy, what ease should I possess.
Freed from their horrors that my soul oppress.
But O my Savior, who my refuge art,
Let thy dear mercies stand twixt them and me:
And be the wall to separate my heart,
So that I may at length repose me free:
That peace, and Joy, and rest may be within,
And I remain divided from my sin.

see her yet I dye, In see- ing of her cru- el- tie, So that to me like mi- se-

So, etc. ^

I Dye when as I do not see
Her that is life and all to me:
And when I see her yet I dye,
In seeing of her cruelty:
So that to me like misery is wrought,
Both when I see and when I see her not.
Or shall I speak or silent grieve,
Yet who will silencie relieve:
And if I speak I may offend,
And speaking not my heart will rend:
So that I see to me it is all one,
Speak I or speak I not, I am undone.
