Mirth and Music to the Cunning-catcher, Derth and Physic to the
Cony-catcher.
SEcundae cogitationes are ever (they say) meliores; and why may not then
secundae Cantiones be as well dulciores? I presume they are so, and that makes
me resume this vain, with hope that I shall not consume in vain my labor
herein.

For first, the kind acceptance of the former Impression is as a new
invitation to this latter Edition, though not of the same things, yet of things
of the same condition; full of the same delectation, made to please, as the
other were; to please I say, and that with as much ease, as the other; made
truly Musical with Art by my correction, and yet plain, and capable with
ease, by my direction.

Again, Bonum quo communius eo melius, we know; and I know no reason, why
incundum, quo communius, should not be as well iucundius: Now then the nature
of these (call them as you will) in regard of their facility and so their
capabilitie is more communicable, then any other kind of Music, and in this
respect more commendable; and will be I am sure more acceptable, because the
things which many heretofore have privately ioyed in, may now by this means,
publicly be inioyed.

Neither, can he, that is the most able Musition say, but that of these most
men, almost all men are capable, that are not altogether immusicall: Neither
can He, that is most spiteful say, but they are very delighfull, I, and some
way gainful too; (yet more painful to me, I am sure, then gainefull.) But,
though there be but little to be gotten by them, yet pity were it, such
Mirth should be forgotten of us; And therefore to make an end, I say no more
but 1/M Siquid nouisti dulc^ius istis.

Candidus imperti; si non, hijs vtere mecum, either commend me, or come and
mend me, and so I end me, as resolute as thou art dissolute.

The Master humble Be has sent me to thee,

For and a greater Lord there may not be.
But at the last consent did she.

And there was bid to this wedding,
all Flies in the field and Worms creeping:
The Snaile she came crawling all over the plain,
with all her ioly trinckets at her train.
5
Ten Bees there came all clad in Gold.
and all the rest did them behold:
But the Thonbud refused this sight to see.
and to a Cow-plat away flies she.

But where now shall this wedding be?
for and hey nonny no in an old Iue tree:
And where now shall be bake our bread?
for and hey nony no in an old horse head.

And where now shall we brew our Ale?
but even within one Walnut shale:
And also where shall we our dinner make,
but even upon a galde Horse back.

For there we shall have good company,
with humbling and bumbling and much melody:
When ended was this wedding day
the Be he took his fly away.

And laid her down upon the Marsh,
between one Marigold and one long grass*
And there they begot good master Gnat,
and made him the heir of all, that is flat.
