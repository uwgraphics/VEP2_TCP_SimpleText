Wit's never good till it is bought: OR.
Good counsel for improvident men.
Fit to make use of now and then.
To the tune of Basses Carreere.


ONce musing alone,
upon things many a one,
Well observed and known by my self,
especially how,
that which late did flow,
I have wasted and now I want pelse:
this vexed me sore,
and made me deplore,
That I had not before of it thought,
from experience I learned,
what I since have discerned,
That tiue wit's never good till it is bought.
Full many a time,
when I was in my prime,
My ambition to climb honor's hill,
did me forward prick,
but my jade did so kick,
And dame fortune a trick found to kill,
my hope in the bloeme,
and debased my plume:
I did further presume than I ought,
then I wished I had stayed,
at my own proper trade,
But true wit's never good till it is bought.
To fight and to brawle,
and to quarrel with all,
And my better's miscall, I have vsd,
but with woe I did find,
all are not of one mind,
Though I often in some kind was excused,
yet sometimes I got,
a knock with a pot,
When to speak and when not, thua I Am taught,
now where ever I come,
I Will keep peace in the rooms,
Thus true wit's never good till it is bought.
I used to roar,
and to drink on the score,
And I never thought more on the shot
come Tapster said I,
one tooth still is dry,
Then fill's (by and by) the other pot,
I called still apace,
but within a short space,
Into a strong place, was I bought,
then for eight hours wast,
four days I must fast,
Thus true wit's never good till it is bought.
I once had command,
of houses and Land,
Thus my case well did stand, among men:
but moved with pride,
and contention beside,
I would wrangle or chide, now and then:
if a horse I but found,
to leap into my ground,
Straight away to the pound, he was brought:
now I wish I had still,
kept my neighbors good will,
But true wit's never good till it is bought.
This rancor and spleen,
my ruin has been,
As may plainly be seen, by my state:
contention in Law,
did my purse empty draw,
Which I never sawfore til it is too late,
upon every slight thing,
I my action would bring,
But my hands now I wring, with the thought:
now I wish I had that,
which has made others flat.
But ttue wit's never good till it is bought.
The second part;
To the same tune.


IN company base,
that are boyd of all grace,
I came often in place, by mere chance,
but being with them,
whom alone I Would condemn,
I Would in presence esteem, and advance:
but being apart,
catechizing my heart,
It much sorrow and smart has me brought:
then with sad melancholy,
I weep for my folly.
Thus wits never good till it is bought.
Bestees now and then,
I have happened with men,
That too conning have bin, at the catch:
And then in my drink,
A with paper and ink,
Have made I did think, a good match:
but after when I,
more deliberately,
The business to try all had boought,
I have foynd my self cheated,
and basely defeated,
Thus wit's never good till' it is bought.
Moreover I have,
told my mind to a knave,
Thinking him truly grave, truly just:
I my heart have exposed,
and my secrets disclosed,
As a friend I reposed, on his trust:
but the Rascal ignoble,
his heart being double,
Me much woe and trouble has wrought
but I Have learnd ere since that,
to take heed of my chat,
Thus true wit's never good till it is bought.
When I was a Lad,
a good service I had,
Then my mind was to gadding (...)
though I nothing did lack,
nor for belly nor back,
Yet I was not with that well content^
but upon small distaste,
my self I displast,
Thus my downfall in haste then shen(...)
since I wished to obtain,
what I often did disdain
Thus true wit's never good (...)
Too willing I was
my own credit to pass,
Now I find it alas, to my pain,
that with setting my hand,
to another man's band,
For to sell honse and Land, I was fain^
I have passed my word,
for what others have scord,
And I often like a bird have bin caught,
in the prison to stay,
where I sung Lachrima,
Thus true wit's never good till (...)
If any of those,
that are (causeless) my foe^
Should so rashly suppose, in them heart^
that all in this song,
to my self does belong,
Their conjecture is wrong, for the(...)
whoeuer they be,
where they something way see,
By which every degree, may be taught,
what ere's thy profession,
thou may learn this lesson,
That wit's never good till it is bought*
