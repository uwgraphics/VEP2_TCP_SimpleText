TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, THOMAS Lord Viscount WENTWORTH, Baron of
Wentworth-woodhouse, LORD Newmarsh and Oversley; Lord President of the Council
established in the North part of England, Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire, One of
his Majesty's most most honorable Privy Council in England, and Lord Deputy
general of Ireland.
RIGHT HONORABLE,
SInce the Conquest of Ireland made by King Henry the second, until of late,
the Office and Authority of a Justice of Peace have very little or nothing at
all been here understood or regarded, but have been altogether eclipsed by
those many and often Rebellions, which have been in this Kingdom almost in
all ages since that happy Conquest. These Rebellions (after many years
continuance) were totally repressed by that illustrious Princess Queen
Elizabeth: who having finished that work was called to another Kingdom, there
to enjoy an everlasting Crown of Glory. Since which time by the goodness of
Almighty God, and the most happy, prudent, and peaceable government of our
late Sovereign King James of blessed memory, and of his most Excellent
Majesty that now is (especially since your Lordships government here) that
Eclipse is so vanished and dispersed that now the light of Justice does
clearly appear and show it self in all parts of Ireland: and the office of a
Justice of Peace is duly regarded, and his Warrant in all parts of the
Kingdom obeyed. So as now it will be needful that the Justice of Peace should
well understand the duty of his place, and neither exceed, nor come short of
the Authority given him, either by Commission, or by the statute Laws of the
Realm. And albeit diverse worthy and learned men in England have published many
profitable Books concerning the Pleas of the Crown, and the Office of a
Justice of peace, yet none of those will be any sufficient guide for the
Justices of peace in Ireland, because the Statute laws of England and Ireland
do in many things differ: for there be many ancient Statutes made in England
some whereof are in some things altered, and others repealed (either in part or
in the whole) by later Statutes which are not of force in Ireland: (so as those
ancient Statutes as they were first enacted remain still of force in this
Kingdom:) and likewise there be many statutes made in Ireland (as well before
10. H. 7. as since) which were never any laws in England. The consideration
whereof has incited me (although by reason of mine age, and other infirmities
least able of all my brethren the Judges) for the help of the Justices of
peace here, to compose this work according to the laws and Statutes now of
force in this Kingdom: which I humbly make bold to present to your Lordships
view and protection, not doubting but as all other labors which any way tend
to the advancement of Justice, and the well ordering of this Commonwealth, so
also these poor endeavors of mine to that purpose will easily obtain your
favorable acceptance. Mine errors or mistakings I shall humbly beseech your
Lordship to pardon and impute them rather to my weakness, want of ability,
and multiplicitie of other employments then to my will: and to accept of this
small mite as a free will offering at the hands of him who for your Lordships
many noble favors will not only ever pray for your happiness and long
continuance in this place of government, but also earnestly desire to manifest
his thankfulness for the same, and to be accounted

Your Lordships humble and faithful servant RI. BOLTON.

THE INTRODVCTION.
Of the Conservators of the Peace. CHAP. 1.
1. BEfore I enter into the handling of the particulars wherein the Justice of
Peace is to exercise his Authority, it will not be amiss in a generality by
way of Introduction to set forth how the Common Law-hath provided for the
preservation of peace, and good government of the Subjects, and how the same
has from time to time been enlarged by several Acts of Parliament. Co. 3.
and. 9. parti prefa^e.
It is plain and apparent that the common Laws of England receiving
principally their grounds from the Laws of God and nature (which law of
nature, as it pertains to man, is also called the law of reason) and being
for their antiquity those whereby the Realm of England was governed many
hundred years before the Norman Conquest; the Equity and Excellency whereof is
such, as that there is no humane Law, within the circuit of the whole world,
by infinite degrees, so apt and profitable, for the honorable, peaceable, and
prosperous government of the Kingdoms of England and Ireland, and so
necessary for all estates, and for all causes, concerning life, lands, or
goods, as these Laws been; These Laws, I say, even from their beginning have
continued a special care for the conservation of the peace, and good
government of the people. And to that purpose at the Common Law (long before
Justices of the peace were made) there were sundry persons to whose charge the
maintenance of this peace was recommended, and who with their other offices had
(and yet still have) the conservation of the Peace annexed to their charges, as
a thing incident to, and unseparable from those offices, And yet nevertheless,
they were and are called by the names of their offices, only the conservation
of the Peace being included therein.

First, 20. H. 7. 7. 2. Co. 11. 85.
the Kings Majesty (by his Dignity Royal) is the principal Conservator of
the Peace within his Dominions (and is Capitalis Iusticiarius Angliae) in whose
hands, at the beginning, the administration of all Justice first was, and
afterward by and from him only was this authority derived and given to others.

2. The Lord Chancellor (or Lord Keeper of the great Seal) the Lord high
Steward of England, the Lord Marshall, and high Constable of England, the Lord
Treasurer of England, and every Justice of the Kings Bench, and also the Master
of the Rolls, have enclosed in their said Offices the conservation of the Peace
over all the Realm, and every of these may award precepts, and take
recognizance for the Peace by virtue of their places; and the like Officers in
Ireland may do the like.

2. H. 7. 1. Br. peace. 12.
3. There be others also (who by virtue of their Offices) have the conservation
of the Peace, but yet only within the precinct of their several Courts, as
namely the Justices of the Court of Common Pleas, the Barons of the Exchequer,
and the Justices of Assise.

4. Also the Steward of the Sheriffs Turn, the Steward of a Leete, and the
Steward of a Court of Pypowder, every of these are Conservators of the Peace
within their several Courts; for every of them may commit him to ward, that
shall make an Affray in their presence, whilst they be in execution of their
Offices; for that these be Courts of Record: and so in all other Courts of
Record.

5. And as well the Steward of the Sheriffs Turn, as also the Steward of a
Leete (during their Courts) may by recognizance bind him to the peace that
shall make an Affray in their presence, Br. Leet. 39. F.N.B. 82.
sitting the Court; 13. H. 4. 12.
And may commit him to Ward, until he has found sureties for the peace. And
may also take the examination of Felons at the Common Law, 21. Ed. 4.^1.
and commit them to the Jail, and may also take the presentment of any Felony
at the Common Law, committed within their precinct; or of any other offense
against the peace, except the death of a man. See Br. Leet. 1. 2. 14. 18. 22.
26.

Co. 8. 38.
6. And so if any other contempt or disturbance to the Court shall be committed
in any (of the said Courts, or in any other) Court of Record, the Judge (or
Steward) there may impose upon such Offenders a reasonable Fine.

F.N.B. 81. d.
7. The Sheriff is a Conservator of the peace within his County; And (upon
request to him made) he may command another to find surety of the Peace, and
may commit him until he find such surety.

7. Coroners also by the Common Law, are Conservators of the peace, within the
County where they be Coroners: but they have power for the keeping of the
peace, only as the Constables have, and no otherwise.

9. The high Constables for hundreds are Conservators of the peace within their
several hundreds and limits.

Br. peace. 13.
10. All petty Constables within the limits of their several Towns be
Conservators of the peace by virtue of their Office.

11. If any man shall make an Affray or assault upon another in the presence of
the Constable: Or if any man shall threaten to kill, beat, or hurt another, and
that complaint shall be made thereof to the Constable, he may commit the
offendour (to the Stocks, or to some other safe custody for the present, and
after may carry him before some Justice of peace, or to the Jail) until he
shall find surety for the peace.

12. These conservators of the peace (by the ancient common Law) are to employ
their own valor; and may also command the help, aid, and force of others,
to arrest and pacify all such, who in their presence, and within their
Jurisdiction, and limits, by word, or deed shall go about to break the peace.

13. Also these Conservators of the peace, if they have committed or bound
over, any such offenders, it seems they are then to send to, or to be
present at, and attend the next Sessions of the peace, or Gaole-delivery, there
to object against such offenders.

The first ordering of Justices of the Peace, and their authority. CHAP. 2.
1. IN Anno Domini 1327. Justices or Commissioners of the Peace were first
created and ordained by the statute of 1. Ed. 3. cap. 16. by which statute it
was ordained that in every Shire of the Realm certain persons should be
assigned ( sc. by the Kings Commission) to keep the peace, And their
authority was after enlarged by the statutes of 4. Ed. 3. cap. 2. 18. Ed. 3.
cap. 2: And 34. Ed. cap. 1. And by the said statute of 34. Ed. 3. cap. 1. they
were first (generally) enabled to hear and determine (at the Kings suite) all
manner of Felonies and Trespasses; And each County had now its proper
Commissioners for the peace, whereas before (it seems) the Commissions to the
Justices of peace were not always made severally into each shire, but
sometimes jointly to sundry persons over sundry shires.

2. But the statute of 36. Edw. 3. cap. 12. is the first statute that names
them Justices of the peace: For the statutes of 2. Ed. 3. cap. 6. and 25. Ed.
3. cap. 6. 7. 8. speaking of Justices seem not to be of our Justices of
peace; but that of 2. E. 3. as also the statute of Winchester, cap. 6. therein
mentioned to be meant of Justices Itinerants, or Justices in Air; and the
other of 25. E. 3. to be meant of Justices or Commissioners specially assigned
for servants and laborers.

3. They be called Justices (of the peace) because they be Judges of Record,
and withal to put them in mind (by their names) that they are to do Justice
(which is to yield to every man his own by even portions, and according to the
laws, customs, and statutes, of this Realm, without respect of persons.)

4. They are named also Commissioners (of the peace) because they have
authority by the Kings Commission.

5. And here it shall not be amiss to put them in mind how that Justice may
be perverted many ways (if they shall not arm themselves with the fear of
God, the love of Truth and Justice, and with the authority and knowledge of the
Laws and Statutes of this Realm, As namely

1. First; by fear, when fearing the power or countenance of another, they do
not Justice, Deuteronomy. 1.17. Ye shall not fear the face of man for the judgment
is Gods.

2. Favor, when they seek to please their Friend, neighbor, or others, Deuteronomy.
ibid. Ye shall have no respect of persons in judgment.

3. Hatred or malice against the party, or some of his, See Levit. 19.18.

4. Covetousness; when they receive or expect gift, or reward, for (as the
wise man says) Rewards and gifts do blind the eyes of the wise, Eccles.
10.28.
and make them dumb that they cannot reprove faults.

5. Perturbation of mind, as anger, or such like passion. James 1.20. The wrath
of man does not accomplish the Righteousness of God.

6. Ignorance, or want of true understanding what is to be done. Ignorantia
matter erroris.

7. Presumption when without law, (or other sufficient rule or warrant) they
(presuming of their own wits) proceed according to their own wills and
affections. There is more hope of a fool, then of him that is wise in his own
conceit. Prove. 26.12.

8. Delay, which in effect is a denying of Justice; Negligentia semper habet
Comitem infortunium, and mora trahit periculum.

9. Precipitation, or too much rashness; when they proceed hastily without
due examination and consideration of the fact, and of all material
circumstances, or without hearing both parties, for as another says (qui
aliquid statuerit part inaudita altera aquum licet sta^uerit, haud aquus est)
he that shall judge or determine of a matter, the one party being unheard,
although he shall give just judgment, yet is he not a just Judge.

His Ma. speech in the S^archamber Anno. 1616.
6. All these his late Majesty King James has shortly, yet fully observed in
his charge lately given to the Judges of England (sc.) charging them, That they
do Justice uprightly and indifferently without delay, partiality, fear or
bribery, with stout and upright hearts, with clean and incorrupt hands, and
yet not to utter their own consents, but the true meaning of the law, not
making laws, but interpreting the Law; (and that according to the true sense
thereof, and after deliberate consultation) remembering that their Office is Ius
dicere, and not Ius dare.

7. According to this last also is the rule given in the book of Judges, sc.
in all causes doubtful first to consider of the matter, Judges 1930.
to consult, and then to give sentence.

8. Yea God himself has given us Presidents of such deliberate proceedings,
as you may see in Genesis, chap. 3. verse. 8. Genesis 3.8.9.11.
etc. and chap. 18. verse. 21.

9. These are worthy Directions for all Justices of peace, that they may carry
themselves in their places uprightly and indifferently, not uttering their own
conceits, nor upon the sudden to overruled things, but after deliberate
consideration and consultation, then to proceed to execute the authority
committed to them.

10. Justices of peace are Judges of Record, Their description or defin^tion.
appointed by the King to be Justices within certain limits, for the
conservation of the peace, and for the execution of diverse things comprehended
within their Commission, and within diverse statutes committed to their charge.

11. Now first that the Justices of peace are Judges of Record, 9. E. 3. 4. 14.
H. 8. 16.
(yea that every Justice of peace by himself is a Judge of Record, and upon
whose sole report and testimony, the law reposeth it self very much) appears
more plainly if you observe these things following:

1. He is made under the great Seal, which is a matter of Record.

2. Every Justice of peace has judicial power given unto him by the
Commission, sc. in the first assignavimus.

3. Also by some statutes they have judicial power given them, for they may
make a Record of a force by them viewed, and may thereupon fine and imprison
the offenders, yea one Justice of peace may also hear and determine, and
punish an offender (in some cases as convicted upon his own view or
examination) as in cases of forcible Deteyner.

4. His warrant (though it be beyond his authority) is not disputable by the
Constable, or other inferior Minister, but must be obeyed and executed by them;
But this must be understood, 14. H. 8. 18. Co. 10. 7. 6.
when the Justice of peace has Jurisdiction of the cause, for, or concerning
which he has granted his warrant; for otherwise the Constable or other Officer
executing such warrant is punishable notwithstanding the warrant.

5. He may take a Recognizance (for the peace, etc.) which is a matter of
Record, and which none can do, but a Judge of Record, See Br. Recog. 8. and 14.

6. His record (or testimony) in some cases is of as great force, and in some
other cases, of greater force, then an Indictment upon the oath of twelve men,
as in cases of Forcible Entry, forcible Deteyner and Riots.

7. Great cause therefore have the Justices of P. to take heed that they abuse
not this their credit and authority, either to the oppressing of the subject,
by making untrue Records, or defrauding of the King, by suppressing true
Records.

12. Now concerning peace, it is the amity, confidence, and quiet, that is
between men, and he that breaks this amity, or quiet, breaks the peace.

13. Yet peace (in our law) most commonly is taken for an abstinence from
actual and injurious force, and offer of violence, and so is rather a
restraining of hands, then an uniting of minds; And for the maintenance of
this peace, chiefly were the Justices of Peace first made.

14. The breach of this peace seems to be any injurious force, or violence,
moved against the person of another, his goods, lands or other possessions,
whether it be by threatening words, or by furious gesture, or force of the
body, or any other force used in terrorem populi.

15. The Office of the Justice of Peace is principally to be exercised to the
suppressing of such injurious and unlawful force, or violence, and yet the
Commission of the P. (being pro conservatione pacis and pro quieto regimine and
gubernatione populi,) I see not why the Justices of Peace should be restrained
from preventing and repressing such other offenses, misbehaviours and deceits
as may break the amity, quiet, and good government of the people; and
whereof discords, and so breaches of the peace do often arise; (though there
appear neither force nor violence in the offense it self) as libellings,
cosinages, and such other offenses.

16. But it is no part of their office to forbid lawful suits; albeit they
shall do well to be mediators of peace in such suites and controversies as
shall arise amongst their neighbors.

17. The Conservation of the peace (and therein the care of the Justice of
peace) consists in three things, viz:

1. In preventing the breach of the peace (wisely foreseeing and repressing
the beginnings thereof) by taking surety for the keeping of it, or for the good
behavior of the offenders, as the case shall require.

2. In pacifying such as are in breaking of the peace.

3. In punishing (according to the law) such as have broken the peace.

18. But of the three, the first; viz. the preventing part, is most worthy to
be commended to the care of the Justices of Peace.

19. Justices of peace (at this day) in Ireland are of two sorts, and are
appointed or created by two several means, videlicet: The one by grant made
by the King by Charter under the great seal, By Charter. Br. Commiss. 5.
as Mayors and chief Officers in diverse corporate Towns: And such the King
cannot discharge again at his pleasure, but they shall continue and enjoy
their Jurisdiction, according as their Charters do enable them: And therefore
if the King grant to a Mayor or other head Officer of a City, or corporate
Town, and to their Successors, to be Justices of peace in their City or
Town, and after makes out a Commission of the peace to others there, yet the
authority and Jurisdiction of the Mayor, etc. remains good, for that it was
granted to them and their successors, and is not revocable at the Kings
pleasure, as a Commission of the peace is. And such Justices of peace by
Charter have thereby the same power, that the Conservators of the peace had by
the Common law; And it seems such power also as is given to the Justices of
peace (or to any one Justice of peace) by express words in any statute: but
none of them have thereby the whole power which is ordinarily given to the
Commissioners of the peace by their Commission.

20. The other sort of Justices of peace are by Commission By Commission.
(made of common course) under the great seal, and these are appointed by the
discretion of the Lord Chancellor, but the authority of these Commissioners of
the peace does determine by diverse means; yet more usually by three means:

First, by the death of the King, or by his Resignation of the Crown.

Secondly, at the Kings pleasure, and that in two sorts: Either by the Kings
pleasure expressed, as the King in express words may discharge them by his
writ under the great seal, or by Supersedeas: 5. E. 4. ^2. Br Commis. 1^ 12.
Ass. 2^. Br. Commis. 13 Br. Commiss. 20. ^^.
but the Supersedeas does but suspend their authority, which may be revived by
a procedendo. Or by implication (as by making other Commissioners of the same
kind, and within the same limits, leaving out the ancient Commissioners names)
10. Ed. 4. 7. and. 3. Mar. 1.

21. But here the ancient Commissioners must have knowledge of such new
Commission; for this determination of the old Commission, Br. Commiss. 2.
grows not immediately by the making of the new Commission; but either by
giving special notice of the new Commission unto the old Commissioners; Or
else by and after the reading (or proclaiming) of the new Commission, at the
Assizes, Sessions of the peace, or at the full County; Or else by holding of
some open Sessions by virtue of the new Commission, (in which two last cases,
the old Commissioners must take notice of the new Commission.) And in all these
cases, if the ancient Commissioners do sit, by virtue of their ancient
Commission, after such notice or publishing of the new Commission, whatsoever
such ancient Commissioners shall so do is void: And contrariwise, until such
notice or publishing of the new Commission, whatsoever mean Acts such ancient
Commissioners shall so do, by virtue of their ancient Commission, the same are
good in Law. 34. Ass. p. S. Br. Commiss 14.

Also in all cases where an ancient Commission of the peace is determined by a
new, yet no proce's or suit depending before the old Commissioners shall be
discontinued thereby, neither shall any other thing done by the Justices of the
peace, by force of their ancient Commission be made, or become void thereby.

23. Note also that although by the death of the King, or by his resignation,
the authority of all Justices of peace (yea and of all Judges, Dyer. 165. Co.
7. 30. Br. Com. 5.
Commissioners of (Oyer and Termyner) Commissioners of Gaole-delivery,
Sheriffs, Escheators; and other Officers that are by Commission) does cease,
yet Mayors, and chief Officers in Cities and corporate Towns, which have the
authority of Justice of peace, or of the conservation of the peace by Charter,
(to them and their Successors) their authority still remains notwithstanding
the Kings death, or resignation.

24. So also the authority of the high Constables and petty Constables
remains, notwithstanding the death of the King, etc. for that their
authority is by the common Law, and to their said Office the conservation of
the peace remains as a thing incident and unseparable from the same.

4. E. 4. 44. Br Offic. 25. Dyer. 165.
25. Coroners also do remain Conservators of the peace, (within the County
where they are Coroners notwithstanding the Kings death, etc. for they are made
by the Kings Writ; and not by Commission, and their office and authority does
remain until they be removed by the Kings Writ; and their office remaining,
the conservation of the peace remains as incident thereto.

Their oaths.
26. Every Justice of peace (before he shall take upon him to exercise the
office of a Justice of Peace) shall take two corporal oaths; the one
concerning the office of a Justice of peace; the other concerning the Kings
supremacy.

27. The oath concerning the office, seems to be by force of the statute made
13. R. 2. ca. 7. the form whereof as it now is follows in these words, viz:

28. Ye shall swear, that as Justice of the peace in the County of Dublin in
all Articles of the Kings Commission to you directed, you shall do equal
right to the poor, and to the rich after your running wit and power, and after
the laws and customs of the realm and statutes thereof made: And ye shall
not be of Council of any quarrel hanging before you: And that ye hold your
Sessions after the form of the Statutes thereof made. And the Issues, Fynes,
and Amerciaments that shall happen to be made, and all Forfeitures which shall
fall before you, ye shall cause to be entered without any concealment (or
imbesilling) and truly send them to the Kings Exchequer; ye shall not let for
gift, or other cause, but well and truly you shall do your office of Justice
of the peace, in that behalf, and that you take nothing for your office of
Justice of the peace to be done, but of the King, and Fees accustomed, and
costs limited by the statute; and ye shall not direct, nor cause to be
directed, any warrant (by you to be made) to the parties, but ye shall direct
them to the Bailiffes of the said County, or other the Kings Officers (or
Ministers) or other indifferent persons to do execution thereof. So help you
God, etc.

29. The parts of this Oath are shortly six.

1. That they shall do equal right to rich and poor, and according to the
laws and statutes of the realm.

2. That they shall not be of Counsel with any person, in any matter depending
before them.

3. That they shall keep their Sessions according to the statutes, 2. H. 5. 4.
which (as it seems) ought to be in the week after the Feast of S. Michael
after the Epiphany, after the clause of Easter, and after the translation of S.
Thomas, which is the third of July.

4. That all Issues, Fines, Amerciaments, and Forfeitures which happen before
them, be by them truly entered, and sent into the Exchequer.

5. That they take nothing for doing their office, but of the King, and the
accustomed Fees appointed by the statutes.

6. That they shall not direct any their warrants to the parties, but to the
Bailiffes of the County, or to other the Kings Officers, or other indifferent
persons.

26. The other oath concerning the Kings supremacy, is by force of the
statute, made secundo Eliz. ca. 1. The form of which oath also follows in
these words: videlicet.

27. I. R. B. do utterly testify and declare in my conscience that the Kings
Highness is the only supreme governor of this Realm, and of all other his
Highness Dominions, and Countries, as well in all spiritual and
Ecclesiastical things (or causes) as temporal: And that no foreign Prince,
person, prelate, State, or potentate, has or ought to have any Jurisdiction,
power, superiority, pre-eminence, or authority Ecclesiastical, or spiritual
within this Realm: And therefore I do utterly renounce and forsake all
foreign Jurisdiction, powers, superiorities and authorities, and do promise
that from henceforth I shall bear faith and true allegiance to the Kings
Highness, his heirs, and lawful Successors, and (to my power) shall assist
and defend all Jurisdictions, privileges, preheminences and authorities,
granted or belonging to the Kings highness, his heirs, and Successors, and
united, and annexed to the Imperial Crown of the Realm. So help me God, etc.

28. Yet it is most usual that both these oaths are taken by a special
Commission: viz. by a writ of Dedimus potestatem, directed out of the Chancery
to some ancient Justice of Peace to take the same oaths (which by them is to
be certified into the same Court,) at such day as the writ commands.

29. If the Justice of peace (or other person) to whom a Dedimus potestatem
shall be directed to take the oaths of a new Justice of peace, shall return
the Commission and the Oaths to be taken, when they were not taken, this is
fineable in the Star Chamber.

30. So if the new Justice of peace shall exercise this office before he has
taken both these Oaths, he is likewise fineable in the Star Chamber.

31. Also if a Justice of peace shall not perform his oath (concerning his
office) he is fineable in the Star Chamber, if the neglect be of corruption, or
any sinister affection, otherwise, it is if it be by Ignorance only.

32. Now forasmuch as the authority of the Justices of peace, arises partly
out of their Commission, and partly out of the statutes, I will set down the
form of the Commissions now used in Ireland, which are consonant to the Laws
and statutes, and to the politic government of this Kingdom.

A president for the Commissions of the peace for all the ^ountyes of Ireland
except Dublin.

These two Commissions do somewhat differ in the second Assignavimus, for by
that for the County of Dublin, the Justices of peace have power to hear and
determine felonyes, but in the other they have no power given them thereby to
hear and determine of any felony, and the reason of this difference is
twofold. First because, no Justices of Assise and jail delivery go into the
County of Dublin. Secondly, because at the quarter Sessions of the peace there
is always one or more of the Judges or of the Kings counsel present. Also
both these Commissions do differ from the usual Commission of the peace in
England in this particular, videlicet. By these Commissions, the Justices of
peace have power to enquire of Treason which the Justices of peace in England
by their Commission have not. The reason is because many offenses which are
common here, are by the Laws of this kingdom Treason which by the Laws in
England are but felony.

33. These Commissions have two parts containing the power of the Justices of
peace.

Stat. Winch. 13. E. 1. 2. E. 3. 6. 2. E. 3. 3.
34. The first Assignavimus, or first part of the Commission does give power to
any one Justice of peace more, or all, to keep and cause to be kept the peace,
and all ordinances and statutes made for the conservation of the peace and for
the quiet government of the people: As namely the statutes made for Huy and
Cry after felons: And the statutes made against Murderers, Robbers, Felons,
Night-walkers, Affrayers, Armor worn in terrorem. Riots, forceible Entries,
and all other force and violence, All which be directly against the peace. The
particulars thereof you shall find more fully hereafter and most of them under
their proper titles.

35. By this first clause in the Commission, the Justices of peace have as well
all the ancyent power touching the peace which the Conservators of the peace
had by the Common law, as also that whole authority which the statutes have
since added thereto.

36. The means which the Justices of peace must use for the keeping of the
peace, and for the execution of these statutes, is as follows.

37. For to prevent the breach of the peace the Iu. of P. may send his warrant
for the party, and may take sufficient sureties of him by recognizance for the
peace, or for the good behavior, as the case shall require, and may send the
party to the Jail for not finding such sureties.

38. But for these statutes made for the peace, they are to be executed
according to such prescript order as themselves do deliver, wherein if no power
at all be expressly given to any one Justice of peace alone, then can he not
otherwise compel the observation thereof (as it seems) then by admonition
only. In which behalf if he shall not be obeyed, he may prefer the cause at
the Sessions and to work it to a presentment upon the statute, and so by the
help of his fellow Justices to hear and determine thereof as law requires.

39. The second Assignavimus, in the Commission does give authority to any two
Justices of the peace, or more, the one being of the Quorum, in these five
things following.

1. To enquire, by a Jury, of all offenses mentioned within the Commission.

2. To take and view all Iudictments and presentiments of the Jury.

3. To grant out process against the offenders, except in cases of Treason, in
the County of Dublin, and cases of Treason and felony in the other Counties,
thereby to cause them to come and answer to the said Iudictments.

4. To try and hear all such offenses (except before excepted) upon any
former or future indictments taken before themselves, or before any other
Justices of the peace after the offenders be come in.

5. To determine thereof by giving Judgment and inflicting punishment upon the
offenders, according to the Laws and statutes.

40. But all the business included within the second Assignavimus, belongs to
the Sessions of the peace, which is to be declared in the second part of this
book, and therefore I forbear to speak of it in this place.

41. Note also that there be diverse statutes, which be not specified within
the Commission, and yet are committed to the charge and care of the Justices of
peace, and are a sufficient warrant and Commission of themselves, although they
be not recited in the Commission: And all such statutes are also to be
executed, according as the same statutes themselves do severally prescribe and
set down.

42. And for that most of the business and practice of the Justices of peace
does consist and lie in the execution of such statutes, as are committed to
their charge (whether they be specified in the Commission, or not specified
there) the numbers of which statutes are exceedingly increased of late years
to the overburthening of all the Justices of peace (And the rather) to give
some little help to such Justices of peace who (being destitute of the
assistance of such as are learned in the Laws) are daily to administer Justice
(and to execute their office at home and out of their Sessions) I have for
their better case herein endeavored (in this treatise) to set down more
orderly and particularly the several parts and branches of every such statute
by it self, under their proper titles, with further referments to the statutes
themselves at large or to the Abridgements.

43. The power and authority of the Justices of peace as well given them by the
said Commission, as by the statutes, is in some cases Ministerial or regular
and limited as a Minister only; And in some other cases judicial or absolute
and as a Judge.

44. Ministerial, when he is thereto commanded by a higher authority.

45. As upon A supplicavit out of the Chancery or Kings Bench, for the taking
of surety for the peace, or good behavior; and a Writ upon the statute of
North-hampton, upon a forceible Entry.

In the execution of which two Writs the Justice of peace may proceed no
further, or otherwise then he is authorized by such writ, and is also to
return the writ, and to certify his doings therein, into the Court whence the
writ came.

46. But in all other cases the power of the Justices of peace is absolute (in
some manner) so as they, and every of them may of their own power proceed ex
officio, and as a Judge; yet this their power is also limited, for they may
neither hang a man for a trespass, nor fine him for a felony, but must
proceed in all things according as they are prescribed by the Commission, and
by the said several statutes.

47. And yet, for that all Considerable circumstances can neither be
comprehended in the Commission, Discretion.
nor foreseen at the time of the making of the statutes. Therefore oftentimes
some things are referred to the consideration of the Justices of peace, and
left to be supplied by them in their discretion.

48. The Commission of the peace (in it self) does leave little, or nothing to
the discretion of the Justices of peace, but does limit them to proceed
secundum leges, consuetudines, ordinationes, et statuta.

49. But by some late statutes some things are therein by special words
referred to the discretion of the Justices of peace, some out of Sessions, and
some at their Sessions.

50. I will here only set down some particulars of such things as are
referred to their discretions out of their Sessions.

1. Laborers. 23. H 6. ca. 13.
One Justice of peace may cause all such persons as be meet to labor (by his
discretion) to work in harvest and hay time.

2. Trespassers in Corn, Orchards, Hedges, or Woods, Trespass. 10. Carol. ca.
23. in hib.
which in the discretion of the Justice, are not thought able to give
satisfaction shall be whipped.

3. Tyle. 17. E. 4. ca. 4.
One Justice of peace may hear and determine by examination or otherwise, by
his discretion, the offenses committed in Tile making.

4. Two Justices may assesse, 10. Carol. ca. 13.
according to their discretions proprotionably all the parishes within the
hundred, toward a contribution for the parties charged upon a Robbery etc.

5. Two, 9. H. 5. ca. 8.
Justices may fine (by their discretion) all buyers and sellers with unlawful
weights and measures.

6. There be some other statutes and some other cases wherein the discretion of
the Justices of peace (out of their Sessions) is tolerated. But the Counsel
of Cicero herein is to be observed. Sapientis est Iudicis, cogitare tantu^ sibi
esse permissum, quantum sit commissum ac creditum.

7. Also the sayings of the late reverend Judge and Sage of the Law (in his
fifth part in Rooks case, Co. li. 5. fo. 100. and li. 10. fo. 140.
and in his tenth part in Keighleys case) are worthy observation, sc. That
discretion is a knowledge or understanding to discern between truth and
falsehood, between right and wrong, between shadows and substance, between
Equity and colorable glosses and pretenses, and not to do according to our
wills and private affections, for talis discretio discretionem confundit. And
therefore in both the recited cases it was holden, that though the words in the
Commission of Sewers do give authority to those Commissioners to do according
to their discretions, that yet their discretion and proceedings ought to be
limited and bounded with the rules of reason, Law, and Justice. Again,
discretion (says he) is scire per legem quid sit justum. And therefore every
Judge, Justice, or Commissioner ought to have duos sales, viz. Salem
sapientiae, ne sit insipidus. Et salem conscientiae, ne sit Diabolus.

8. And (as Master Lambert well said) no way better shall the discretion of a
Justice of peace appear, then if he (remembering that he is lex loquens) shall
contain himself within the lists of Law, and shall not use his discretion but
only where both the Law permits and the present case requires.

9. In all cases therefore where the statutes do refer the Trial of
offenders (or hearing and determining of offenses) to the discretion of the
Justice or Justices of peace (out of Sessions) it is very requisite that upon
such trial or hearing the said Justices take due examination of the offenders
themselves, or of credible witnesses, (as well concerning the fact it self, as
the circumstances thereof,) and upon confession or other due proof of the
offense. Then to proceed according to Law and Justice.

10. Note that in all cases where the statute refers the trial, etc. to the
discretion of the Justices, the said statutes themselves do also enable the
said Just. of P. to take the examination of witnesses upon oath.

11. Note further that the Justices of peace out of their Sessions, are now
armed with far more ample authority and power than the ancient Conservators
of the peace were. For the Justices of peace have double power given them. The
one of Jurisdiction to convent the offenders before them by their warrant (in
diverse cases) to examine, hear, and determine the cause. The other of
coertion, ( sc. that after the cause hard) to constrain them to the obedience
and observance of their order and decree, which notwithstanding must be
according to the rules of Law and Justice as aforesaid. Whereas the ancient
conservatours of the peace had no Jurisdiction or authori^ie at all either to
convent the offender before them, or to examine, hear or determine the cause,
but had only coertion, prehension or punishment of an offendour, in some few
cases.

Plo. 37.
And here I must further put the Justices of peace in mind, that their
authority and power is limited to be by them exercised, only within the County
or Countyes where they be in Commission; And yet in that or those County or
Countyes, the Justices of peace of the County must not intermedle in any City
there, which is a County of it self. Nor in any City or corporate Town there
(though it be no County of it self,) but within the County which have their
proper Justices of peace within themselves by the Kings Charter or Commission,
Cromp. 8. 181.
especially if in such Charter there be any special words of prohibition, that
the Justices of the shire. ( Non se intromittant, etc.) except such Country
Justices shall also be in Commission in such City or Town corporate.

12. But in other corporate Towns, which have not their proper Justices of
peace; Cromp. ib.
As also in all liberties and Franchises within the County, which have the
return of writs, but have not their proper Justices, there the Justices of
peace of the County ought to execute their authority, and that by the words of
their Commission.

13. Again, if a parish shall extend into two or more Counties. Or if part
thereof shall lie within the liberties of any City, or Town corporate (which
have their proper Justices) and part without. Then as well the Justices of peace
of every County as also the Justices, or officers of such City or Town
corporate shall intermedle only within their own proper and distinct limits
and bounds, sc. within so much of the said parish, Co. 4. 46.
etc. as lies within their several liberties and limits, and not to invade or
deal in other jurisdictions, for it shall be against Law and reason where
offices and Jurisdictions are several, that the one should intermedle within
the Jurisdiction of the other.

14. Neither shall any Justice of peace deal in, or punish any trespass, Vbi
quis delinquet ibi puniet.
or other like offense, committed in any other County (against any penal
statute) though such offender shall be brought before him; Except the statute
shall specially enable them thereto, or that it be for matters of the peace, or
in cases of felony or Treason; in which cases only he may take examinations
both of the offendour and accusers, and commit the offenders to prison, and
security for the peace if it be offered.

15. Neither shall any Justice of peace for the time that he shall make his
abode or be out of the County where he is in Commission, exercise his office:
For being out of the County where he is in Commission, he is but a private man.

16. Now my purpose is to set down more particularly what things Justices of
peace out of their Sessions of the peace may do in the execution of their
Commission, or of the statutes wherewith they are charged. And herein you must
observe that some things are permitted to be executed by any one, two, or more
Justices, either in regard that such Justice or Justices is or are next to the
place, or are of the Quorum, or the like.

17. And here note that whatsoever any one Justice of peace alone may do
(either for the keeping of the peace, or in other execution of the Commission
or statutes) the same also may lawfully be done and performed by any two, or
more Justices.

18. But where the Law gives authority to Two, Co. li. 4. fo. 46.
there one alone cannot execute this, for una persona non potest supplere vicem
duarum. Et plus vident Oculi quam oculus.

19. Also when things by statute are appropriated to some one certain Justice,
or to more, Co. li. 11. fo. 92.
there such Justice or Justices are to pursue such their authority
accordingly, for where an authority is given to four, or to one of them, if
two of them shall execute this, it seems they have not pursued their
authority.

20. Plo. fo. 206. 6.
Besides there seems a general rule to be put in Stradlings case (in M.
Plo.) that when a thing is appointed by any statute to be done by, or before
one person, See. Co. li. 11. fo. 59. and 64.
certain that such thing cannot be done by or before any other. But that it
ought to be done as the statute has appointed, and by such express
designation of one, or power given to one certain person, all others are
excluded.

21. And in such things appropriate to some one or more Justices of peace, if
without such Justice or Justices, all (or any of) the residue of the Justices
of that County shall intermedle therein. Such their doings is no ways
warrantable, and in such their proceedings there is no necessity to obey them,
as being no lawful Judges of the cause.

22. Now having made a brief declaration of the office of Justices of the
peace in general by way of Introduction I shall proceed to the particulars of
their employment in several Titles according to the Alphabet.

Affray. CHAP. 1.
1. AFfray, is derived of the French-word Effrayer, which signifies to
terrify, or bring fear, and which the Law understands to be a common wrong,
and therefore I will show you what every man may do in such cases.

Every private man.
2. Every private man being present before, or in and during the time of an
Affray, ought to stay the Affrayors, and to part them, and to put them in
sunder, but may not hurt them, if they resist him, for that he is but a private
man.

3. An Affray being in the street, if any other shall come with harness or
weapon to join with either part, every person present, or that sees it, may
stay them till the Affray be over.

4. Also every private man (being present) may stay the Affrayors, until their
heat be over, and then may deliver them to the Constable to imprison them till
they find surety for the peace.

3. H. 7. cap. 1. Br. Coron. 225.
5. If any person be dangerously hurt in any Affray, or otherwise, every person
may arrest the offender, and carry him to a Justice of peace (who is either to
bail him, until the next jail deliverie, or to commit him to the jail,
until it be known whether the party hurt; will live or dye thereon.)

6. The Constable The Constable.
in such cases is armed with a more large authority, for he may and ought in
the Kings name to command the Affrayors, or such as are about to make an
Affray, to avoid or surcease, and to depart; And if the Constable (being
present at an Affray) does not his best to part them, it being presented at the
Sessions of the peace, such Constable shall be deeply fined for it.

3. H. 7. 10.
7. If the Affrayors will not depart, but shall draw weapon, or give any blow,
the Constable may command of assistance of others for the pacifying of the
Affray, and may justify the hurting of them, if they make resistance.

8. The Constable may in the Kings name command the Affrayors to keep the
Kings peace.

9. The Constables may commit the Affrayors to prison for a small time, till
their heat be over; yea they may imprison the Affrayors till they find
sureties for the peace, And if any of the parties has received any dangerous
hurt in the Affray, the Constable ought to arrest and carry the offender to the
jail (or to a Justice of peace) to the end he may find surety to appear at
the next jail deliverie, and the Constable may justify the beating of such an
offender, 8. Ed. 3. 8. and 11.
if he will not obey the arrest, but make resistance, or flies.

10. Note, that it is properly no Affray, unless there be some weapons drawn,
or some stroke given, or offered to be given, or other attempt to such purpose.
For if men shall contend only in hot words, this is no Affray; neither may the
Constable for words only lay hands upon them, unless they shall threaten to
kill, beat, or hurt one another, and then may the Constable arrest such persons
(to go before some Justice of peace, to find sureties for the keeping of the
peace) and yet such threatening is no Affray.

11. If the Affray be in an house, and the doors shut, the Constable may
break into the house to see the peace kept, because he by his office is a
Conservator of the peace by the common Law.

12. If the Affrayors fly into another man's house, 7. Ed. 3. 19.
the Constable (in fresh suite) may break into the house and apprehend the
Affrayors. 7. Ed. 3. 19.

13. If the Affrayors fly into another County, the Constable (or Justice of
Peace) seeing this, may in fresh suite pursue, Plo. 37. A. crom. 146. B. and
172. b.
or cause them to be pursued, and to be taken there, but they can then meddle no
further but (as every private person may do) to carry them before some Justice
of peace of the County where they are taken, to cause them to find surety for
the peace.

14. Cromp. 1. 46.
But if the Affrayors fly into a Franchise within the same County, the
Constable (or Justice of peace) seeing this, may in fresh suite pursue and take
them out of such Franchise.

15. After the Affray (it seems) the Constable without a warrant cannot
arrest the Affrayors, F. Imp. 6.
except some person be in peril of death by some hurt there receyved.

16. Every Justice of peace may do that, which every Constable or private man
may do by the common Law.

17. 9. Ed. 4. 3. Cromp. 195. 196.
Besides every Justice of peace (within his limits) may presently after the
Affray, commit the offenders, until they have found surety for the peace, if
the Affray were in his presence. And if the Affray were not in his presence
then upon Complaint or upon his own discretion, he may after make his warrant
to take and commit such offenders, until they have found surety for the peace.

18. If an Affray be made in the presence of a Justice of peace, he may lay
hands upon, and arrest the offenders, to find sureties, etc. and may take away
their weapons.

19. Every Justice of peace (in his own discretion) and ex officio, The
Justice.
may bind all such to the peace as in his presence shall strike another, or
shall threaten to hurt another, or shall contend only in hot words. vide tit.
Surety for the peace.

20. If any person be dangerously hurt, F Just. P 137. 10. H. 7. 20. Cromp. 154.
in an Affray (or otherwise) every Justice of peace within the year and day
after such hurt, may commit to the jail such offenders, there to remain
until the day and year be expired, or that the said offenders shall find
sureties to appear at the next general jail deliverie to answer to the
felony, if the party hurt happen to die within the year after the hurt.

21. If an Affray, or assault shall be made upon a Justice of peace, 5. H. 7. 6.
or Constable, they may not only defend themselves, but may also apprehend,
and commit the offenders, until they have found sureties for the peace, the
Justice of peace may send them to the jail, but the Constable must commit them
to the Stocks for the present, and after carry them before a Justice of peace.

Armor. CHAP. 2.
One Justice.
1. IF any person shall ride, or go armed offensively before the Justices or
any other the Kings officers, 2. E. 3. cap. 3. P. 1. 20. R. 2. ca 1.
Or in Fayres, Markets, or elsewhere (by night or by day) in Affray of the
Kings people (the Sheriff and other the Kings officers, and every Justice of
peace (upon his own view or upon complaint thereof) may cause them to be
stayed and arrested, and may bind all such to the peace or good behavior, or
for want of sureties, may commit them to the Jail; And the said Justice of
peace (as also every Constable) may seize and take away their armor, and other
weapons, and shall cause them to be praised and answered to the King as
forfeited, Lamb. office of a Constable. 13.
and this the Justice of peace may do by the first Assignavimus in the
Commission.

2. So of such as shall carry any Guns, Dagges, or Pistols that be charged, or
that shall go apparelled with privy Coats, or doublets, the Justice may cause
them to find sureties for the peace, and may take away such weapons.

3. And yet the Kings servants in his presence, and Sheriffs and their
officers, and other the Kings Ministers, and such as be in their company
assisting them, in executing the Kings process, or otherwise in executing of
their office, and all others in pursuing Huy and Cry where any Treason, Felony,
or other like offenses against the peace, be done, may lawfully bear armor or
weapons.

4. Also any Justice of peace may command that weapons be taken from such
prisoners as at any time shall be brought before him.

5. Also if any servant to husbandry, or to any Artificer, or Victualer, or
any Labourer, shall bear any Buckler, Sword or Dagger, (except they be
traveling with their Master, or in their Masters message.) Every Justice of
peace may imprison them, till they have found sureties for the peace, 12. R. 2.
6. P. 2.
and may seize and take away their said weapons, or may cause the Constable to
seize the same, and to present the said weapons at the next Sessions of the
peace.

Arrest and imprisonment by what warrant, and how, and in what manner it may be
executed. CHAP. 3.
What.
1. AN arrest is the apprehending, and first restrayning of a man's person,
depriving it of his own will and liberty, and may be called the beginning of
Imprisonment.

2. Imprisonment is where a man is arrested against his will, and is restrained
of his liberty, by putting him into the Jail, cage, or Stocks, or into some
house, or otherwise by keeping him in the high street, or open field, so as he
cannot freely go at liberty, when and whither he would.

3. By Parol.
Now concerning the precepts and warrants made by the Justices of peace.

4. The Justice of peace (seeing that he is a Judge of Record) his precept or
Commandment by word of mouth, in some cases is as strong as his precept in
writing.

5. And therefore the Justice of peace upon a Riot done in his presence, may
command the Riotters to be arrested, and cause them to find sureties for their
good behavior.

6. So upon an Affray, assault, threatening, or other breach of the peace done
in his presence, the Justice of peace may command by word the Officer being
present, or his own servant to arrest such offenders, to find sureties for
the peace.

7. And where the Justice of peace commands one being present, to arrest
another that is also in his presence, 14. H. 7. 8, 9.
though that commandment be by word only, it is good, and it is reputed as an
arrest made by the Justice himself, he being present when the arrest is made.

8. But the Justice of peace cannot command by word, 14. H. 7. 8.
to arrest another being out of his present, neither may one in the absence of
the Justice arrest another upon his command by paroll, Br. peace. 7.
but it must be by a precept, or warrant in writing.

9. Next the warrant or precept of a Justice of peace by writing By writing.
ought to be under his hand and seal, or under his hand at least.

10. And if it be for the peace or good behavior, or the like, where sureties
are to be found or required, There the warrant ought to contain the special
cause and matter whereupon it is granted, to the intent that the party upon
whom it is to be served, may provide his sureties ready and take them with him
to the Iu. of peace to be bound for him. But if the warrant be for Treason,
murder or felony, or other capital offense, or for great conspiracies,
rebellions, assemblies, or the like, it needs not contain any special cause,
but there the warrant of the Iu. of peace may be to bring the party before him
to make answer to such things or matters generally as shall be objected against
him, on the Kings Majesty's behalf, Cromp. 148.
and this is now the common usage.

11. Plo. 37.
A Justice of peace who is dwelling out of the County grants his warrant to
be served within the County, the officer cannot carry the party out of the
County to the Justice of peace who made the warrant, but must carry him before
some other Iu. within the County.

12. Br. Peace. ^. Co. 5. 59.
The Justice of peace may make his warrant of the peace to bring the party
before himself, and then the officer need not to carry the party before any
other Justice, And yet upon a warrant for the peace granted ex officio, the
usual manner is otherwise.

13. Also the Justice of peace may in some cases make his warrant to attach the
offender to be at the next Sessions of the peace, there to answer his said
offense.

For what cause.
14. A Justice of peace (ex officio) by the the first Assignavimus in the
Commission, may grant his warrant to arrest or attach one that has broken the
peace, or committed other misdemeanour against the peace, to find sureties for
the peace or good behavior.

15. Also the Justices of peace in diverse cases (as the case shall require) do
use to grant their warrant against a man for his neglect, or other default, as
for refusing to pay Country or Town Rates and the like, and is warranted by
the first Assignavimus of the Commission, for it is pro bono regimine.

16. And such warrant may be either to attach the offender to be at the next
Sessions, there to answer etc. or else to bring the offender before the said Iu.
or any other Justice, etc. who finding cause, may bind such an offender to
appear at the next Sessions, to answer the said default.

17. Also wheresoever any statute does give authority to the Justices of peace
to cause another person to do a thing, there it seems, they have power given
them (of congruity) to grant their warrant to bring such person before them,
that so they may take order therein.

18. Also a Justice of peace may grant his warrant to attach persons suspected
of felony or Treason, and that by the first Assignavimus, in the Commission,
and by the true construction of the statute of 5. Ed. 3. 14.

19. Again, if a felony or Treason be committed, there is no doubt but that
every private man without a warrant may arrest whomsoever he suspecteth of it,
being a man of evil fame, etc. But if the offender being pursued shall resist,
who shall be ayding to a private man whose goods are stolen, and who suspecteth
another to have stolen them, either to search for his goods or to apprehend the
party suspected, if the Justice of peace by this warrant shall not command the
Constable to aid him therein. If it be objected that the Constable may do all
this of his own authority (upon request to him made by the party robbed) it is
true, and yet we find by common experience that the Constables wihout the
Justices warrant therein, are for the most part, both very fearful and also
remiss, as neither knowing their own authority, nor the danger.

20. Besides, his is no new thing, for there is such a president in the old
book of Justices of peace (impress. 1561. F. 41. a.) and it is the Common
practice at this day, and seems to be very serviceable.

Crom. 197.
21. Next for the Justices of peace to bind over, or to grant a warrant against
offenders upon any penal statute, to appear at the Sessions, to answer to
their offense or fault, though such statute be within the power of the Justices
of peace, yet such warrant or binding over of such offenders is not warranted,
unless it be specially so appointed in the statute.

22. But such offenders ought first to be indicted, and thereupon the ordinary
process from the Sessions to be issued by the Clerk of the peace, is to be
awarded against them, until they come in.

23. Crom. 238.
And yet there be sundry presidents of Attachments made from one Justice of
peace against laborers and servants, that shall refuse to serve, or that shall
depart out of their service etc. contrary to the statutes, to be before the
Justices at then Sessions, to answer to their said defaults. Rast. 232. D.
But these seem also to be warranted and so appointed by the statutes of
Laborers made in anno 23. Ed. 3. Anno. 25. lid. 3. ca. 6. and other statutes to
that purpose.

24. To whom directed. 14. H. 8. 16. B. peace. 6.
The Justice of peace may direct his precept or warrant to the Sheriff,
Bailiffe, Constable or other officer, or to any other indifferent person by
name, though he be no officer, yea to any person that he shall think meet, but
yet the safest way is to direct it to the Constables, or to some other sworn
officers.

25. A warrant directed by the Iu. of peace to the Constable or other sworn
officer, and to a stranger who is no officer, Cromp. 147.
and the warrant is made conjunctim et divisim and is delivered to the stranger
who executes it, all this is good.

26. A warrant directed by the Iu. of P. to the Sheriff, he may by word
command his undersheriffe, Bailiffe, or other sworn officer to serve it,
without any precept by writing.

27. But if the Sheriff will command another man (that is no such known
officer) to serve it, he must deliver him a precept in writing, otherwise a
writ of false imprisonment will lie for the arrest.

28. A warrant directed by the Iu. of P. to the Sheriffs, Baliffe, or to the
Constable, or to the Iu. servant, or to an estranger, to arrest one etc. such
person to whom that warrant is made, must serve it himself, for these can
command none other to do it neither by word nor writing, nor make any deputy.

29. The officer to whom any warrant shall be directed and delivered, The
officers duty.
ought withal speed and secrecy to seek and find out the party, and then to
execute his said warrant.

30. A sworn and known officer, be he Sheriff, 8. E. 4. 1. 4. 14. H. 7. 9.
b. 20. H. 7. 11. 21. H. 7. 24. Co. 9. 69.
undersheriffe Bailiffe, or Constable etc. needs not to show his warrant to a
man when he comes to serve it upon him, although he demands it, But if the
Justice will direct his warrant to his servant, or to another (who is no sworn
officer) to serve it, they must show their warrant to the party, if he demand
it, or otherwise the party may make resistance, and need not to obey it.

31. But a known and sworn officer, Co. 6. 54. and 96. 8.
if he will not show his warrant to the party, yet he ought, upon the arrest,
to declare the contents of his warrant etc.

Co. 9. 69.
32. And an officer gives sufficient notice what he, is when he says to the
party, I arrest you in the Kings name, etc. And in such case the party at his
peril ought to obey him, though he knows him not to be an officer, And if he
have no lawful warrant, the party grieved may have his action of false
imprisonment against him.

Dyer 224. F. Bar. 248.
33. If an officer do arrest a man for the peace, or the like, before that he
has any warrant, and then afterward does procure a warrant (or a warrant
comes after to him) to arrest the party for the same cause, yet the first
arrest was wrongful, and the officer is subject to an action of false
imprisonment.

34. Where they be two or three known by the name of I. S. of D. yeoman and
upon a warrant or other process granted out against one of them, another of
them is arrested, an action of false imprisonment will not lie against the
officer for this, for the officer is not bound at his peril, to take notice
which of them is the offendour, And perhaps no particular offense is mentioned
in the warrant.

35. Where a warrant is granted out against I. N. the son of W. N. and the
officer thereupon arresteth. 10. E. 4. 12.
I. N. the son of T. N. although in truth he be the same person that
offended, and against whom the complaint was made, yet this arrest is tortious,
and the Officer subject to an Action of false imprisonment.

36. The officer upon any warrant from a Justice of peace for the peace, or
good behavior, or in any other case where the King is a party, may by force
break open a man's house, to arrest the offender.

37. If an officer or other person has arrested a man by virtue of his
warrant, which he has from a Iu. of peace, and then takes his promise that
he will come again to him such a day to go to the Iu. with him according to
his warrant (and so lets the party go) who comes not again at the day
appointed, co. 1. 44. 52.
the officer cannot after arrest or take him again by force of his former
warrant, for that this was by the consent of the officer, But if the party
arrested had escaped of his own wrong without the consent of the officer, now
upon fresh suite the officer may take him again, although he were out of view,
or that he shall fly into another Town or County.

38. Where an officer has received a warrant, he is bound to pursue the effect
of his warrant in every behalf, or otherwise his warrant will not excuse him
of that which he has done.

21. H. 7. 39.
39. If an officer having a lawful warrant to arrest another shall be resisted,
or assaulted by the party, or by any other person, then may that officer
justify the beating or hurting of such persons, and others, upon his prayer,
may and ought to aid the Officer.

^4. H. 8. 16.
40. If a Justice of peace shall make any warrant for a matter wherein he has
jurisdiction, although it be beyond his authority, yet it is not disputable by
the Constable, or other such officer, but must be obeyed and executed by the
Officer. As if the Iu. of peace shall make his warrant to arrest one for the
peace, or good behavior without cause, the officer shall not be punished for
executing this. Co. 10. 67.
But if a Iu. of P. shall make his warrant to do a thing out of his
Jurisdiction, or in a cause whereof the Justice of peace is no Judge, if the
officer shall execute such a warrant, here he is punishable, for the officer is
not bound to obey him who is not Judge of the cause, no more then a mere
stranger. And so note that the officer is bound to take notice of the authority
and jurisdiction of the Judge. 22. Ass. 64. Plo. 394. b.

41. If any man shall abuse the Iu. of peace his warrant as by casting of it
into the dirt, or treading it under his feet, he may be bound to his good
behavior and may also be indicted and fined, for it is the Kings process.

42. When any person comes before the Iu. of peace by force of any warrant
for the peace, good behavior, or for a Riot, or the like, the party must offer
sureties, or else the Iu. may commit him.

43. If a Justice of peace shall grant his warrant, to one to apprehend another
for Treason or felony, it shall be safe for the Justice upon the delivery of his
said warrant, to take (upon oath) the examination of the said party that
requires the warrant, or at least, to bind him over by recognizance to give
Evidence at the next jail delivery against the offendour, least that
afterward when the offender shall be brought, by the officer, before the Iu.
upon his said warrant, or else happen to yield himself to the said Justice,
then the party that procured the warrant be gone.

44. If the Constable or other officer (upon a warrant received from a Iu. of
peace) shall come unto the party, and require, or charge, or command him to go
or come before the Iu. this is no arrest or imprisonment, and upon a warrant
for the P. the officer ought first to require the party to go before the Iu.
before he may arrest him.

45. But this arrest (being in execution of the commandment of some Court or
some officer of Justice) is expressed in their writs, precepts, or warrants, by
these words, or the like, sc. Capias, Attachias, etc. to attach, arrest, take,
bring, or convay, or cause to be attached, arrested, etc. All which words do
imply the taking, and laying hold of the person.

46. What persons.
To this arrest all lay persons (under the degree of Barons or peers of the
Realm) be subject, and that by warrant from the Justices of peace, as you may
see here, tit. Surety for the peace.

47. But the Iu. of P. are not to grant their warrants for the peace or the
like against any noble man: And yet if a capias, or attachment shall be awarded
against a Baron or Peer of the Realm from the K. Justices at Dublin for a
contempt, or in case, of debt or trespass, the officer without any offense of
Law, may execute the same, for that the officer is not to dispute the authority
of the Court.

48. Ecclesiastical persons also may be arrested and that by warrant from the
Justices of peace in some cases, see more hereof in the Title. Surety for the
peace.

A woman covert, may be imprisoned by the Iu. of P. for a force or Riot
committed by her.

49. But otherwise of young Infants in such cases, yet if an Infant of years
of discretion cannot find sureties for the peace, being demanded against him,
he shall be committed until he has found sureties.

50. The liberty of a man is a thing specially favored by the common Law of
this land, and therefore if any of the K. subjects shall imprison another
without sufficient warrant, the party grieved may have his Action of false
imprisonment, and shall recover damages against the other, And the King also
shall have a Fine of him: For imprisonment of another without authority of the
Law.

51. Also by the statute of Magna Charta made 9. H. 3. ca. 29. No freeman
shall be taken or imprisoned etc. but by the lawful judgment of his equals (
sc. by the verdict of a Jury of 12. P. Accusat. 1. 5. E. 3. ca. 9.
good and lawful men) or by the Law of the realm: Co. 10. 74. and 75.
And by this statute of Magna Charta, Every arrest or imprisonment and every
oppression against the Law of the land is forbidden, and if any Judge, Officer,
or other person against the Law shall usurp any jurisdiction, and by color
thereof shall arrest, imprison or oppress any man, it is punishable by this
statute. See Co. 10. 75.

52. Note that all jurisdictions ought to be either by Charter or by
prescription, Co. 11. 99.

42. Ass. p. 5.
53. Also by the statutes of 25. Ed. 3. cap. 4. and 42. Ed. 3. cap. 3. No person
shall be taken, nor put to answer, unless it be by indictment or presentment
(of a Jury) before Justices, or matter of record, or by due process made by
writ original at the common Law, 42. Ass. 5.

42. Ass. p. 5.
54. A Commission to arrest or take a man (and his goods) was holden to be
against Law, for that this ought to be either upon indictment, or suit of the
party or other due process of Law. Br. Commiss. 15. 16. and Faux Impris. 9.

55. Neither shall any man commit another to prison, except he he be a Judge of
Record. Co. 10. 103.

See Co. 3. 12. A.
56. And yet for misdemeanors done against the Kings peace the offenders as well
by the common Law, as by diverse statutes, may be arrested and imprisoned, by
the officers of justice, and sometimes by private persons (as hereunder
follows) without either presentment or process etc. And these being by the
Law of the realm, are warranted by the aforesaid statute of Magna Charta, 10.
E. 4. 17.
As every private man may arrest another whom he knows to have committed a
Treason, robbery, manslaughter, or other felony, and may deliver him to the
Constable of the Town where such an offender is apprehended, 9. E. 4. 28.
Or in the Constables absence may imprison and set him in the stocks, and if
there be no stocks there, it seems he may carry the offender to the next
Town and deliver him to the Constable there, Vide 9. E. 4. 28.
or bring him before a Justice of peace to be by him committed and examined.

57. Also when a Treason or felony is committed, every man may arrest
suspicious persons that be of evil fame, and if such person shall make
resistance, the other may justify to beat him.

58. But for the arresting of such suspicious persons, note that there must be
some Treason or felony committed indeed.

59. Also the party that shall arrest such suspected person must have a
suspicion of him himself, and for the same Treason or felony, 9. Ed. 4. 28.
or otherwise suspicion generally is no cause to arrest another.

60. So that when any Treason or felony is done, every man that shall suspect
another to be guilty thereof may arrest him, 5. H. 7. 4. 5. H. 7. 4.
B. Br. Faux. Imprisonment 16.

61. Also when a felony is committed, the common voice and fame that I.S. did
the felony, is sufficient cause for any man to suspect him, 5. H. 7. 4.
and to arrest him. Also Huy and Cry after I. S. for felony, seems to be
sufficient cause to arrest him, though there be no felony committed: Also Huy
and Cry is sufficient cause to arrest any suspicious person.

62. So when a felony is done, to be in company of the offenders, is sufficient
cause to arrest him. 9. Ed. 4. 28. Nedham.
So to live idly and vagrant is good cause of suspicion, Also every man may
arrest such as apparently go about to commit any felony, and may imprison them.

63. Also upon Huy and Cry for goods stolen ( sc. for a horse or Bullockes,
etc. of such a color, etc. 29. Ed. 3. 39. 5. H. 7. 4.
) If A. be taken driving or leading such a horse, or bullock, or having such
other stolen goods about him, though he be a man of good name and credit, yet
every man may apprehend and stay A. hereupon, and may deliver him to the
Constables by them to be set in the stocks, or safely kept, until they can
carry him before a Justice of peace, that so he may be delivered by course of
Law.

64. If any man shall be dangerously hurt in an Affray, 10. H. 7. 28.
or otherwise, every man may arrest and imprison the offendour.

65. Nightwalkers, being strangers, or suspected persons, watchmen may arrest
them, and may stay them till the morning; yea every man may arrest such
Nightwalkers, for it is for the good of the Commonwealth, 4. H. 7. 18. Br.
Faux Imprisonment 15.

66. The Sheriff, Bailiffes, Constables, and other the Kings officers may
arrest and imprison offenders, By officers.
in all cases where a private person may, and without any writ or warrant.

67. A Constable being informed of a lewd man and woman that are together in
incontinency, 1. H. 7. 7. 13. H. 7. 10.
may take with him so many of his neighbors as he will, to arrest the said man
and woman, to find sureties for their good behavior. 1. H. 7. 7. 13. H. 7. 16.

68. The Justice of peace may arrest and imprison offenders in all cases,
where a private person, or Constable may.

69. The Iu. of P. upon his own motion and discretion, or upon complaint, may
also grant out his warrant, for the arresting or conventing before him, of all
such persons as shall break, or go about to break the peace, or as he shall
suspect to be inclined to break the peace, and may commit them to prison, if
they shall refuse to find, or cannot find sureties for to keep the peace.

70. The Iu. of peace, in diverse cases, may in like sort grant out his
warrant, for the good behavior, against offenders, and commi^ them to prison,
for not finding sureties accordingly.

71. And these things the Iu. of peace may do by force of the Commission and
of the statutes 18. E. 3. ca. 2. et 34. Ed. 3. cap. 1.

72. If one comes before the Justice of peace upon his warrant for the peace,
good behavior, or for a Riot, or the like, the Justice needs not to demand
surety of him, but may commit him, if he do not offer it Br. peace 7.

73. Also the Justices of peace upon their own view of the offenses may
imprison the offenders against diverse penal Laws, as namely such as shall
make any forceible Entries or holdings of possessions.

74. There be diverse other offenses which by the statutes are committed to the
Iu. of peace (out of their Sessions) to hear and determine, And of which the
offenders shall be convicted sometimes upon their own confession, before the Iu.
and sometimes upon examination and proof of witnesses, In all which cases the
said Justices of peace may convent the said offenders before them (by their
process or warrant) and after such examination and conviction they may
Imprison or otherwise punish the offenders according as they are limited by
the said statutes.

75. Wheresoever the Iu. of peace has power or authority given him by any
statute to bind over any man or to cause a man to do any thing, if such person
(being in his presence) shall refuse to be bound, or to do such thing, such
Justice may send such person to the Jail, there to remain, till he shall
perform the same.

76. All men being required ought to assist the K. officers, to pursue and
arrest Traitors, Felons, and all other offenders against the peace.

Resist. 2. E. 4. 6. 21. H. 7. 39.
77. If the party against whom any lawful warrant is granted shall make
resistance, or shall make an assault upon the officer, the officer may justify
the beating and hurting of him, and may also imprison him in the Stocks for the
same. But if the party resists or flies before he be arrested, the officer
cannot justify the beating of him. 2. Ed. 4. 7. a. Br. Trespass. 296.

Imprisonment the place. 5. H. 4. 10. P. Prison. 1.
78. None shall be imprisoned by any Iu. of peace, but only in the Common jail,
by the statute of 5. H. 4. And therefore Justices of peace cannot commit felons
to any prisons which be no common gaoles, nor make a jail of their own
houses. And yet Justices of peace may commit to the stocks some offenders
against certain penal statutes.

20. Ed. 4. 6. 22. Ed 4. 35. 3. H. 4. 9.
79. The Constable or other such officer cannot imprison any man in his house
(as it seems) but in the Stocks, and that not above such a reasonable time,
as he may provide conveniently and safely to convey the prisoner to the Just.
of peace or to the jail.

80. If a man commit felony or Treason in one County, and be arrested for the
same in another County, although he cannot be tried nor indicted in the County
where he was apprehended, yet he shall be there imprisoned until by the Justices
of Assise or the Justices of the Kings Bench, he shall be sent to the jail of
the County where the fact was committed.

81. The Constable or other officer pursuing a felon into another County takes
him there, 13. E. 4. 8.
the felon shall be brought before a Justice of peace of that County, and by
him committed to the jail of the County, where he is taken. For the officer
being out of his County has no more authority there, than a private man.

82. Also if the Constable, or other officer, shall see an Affray and he
coming to arrest them, the Affrayors do fly into another County, the officer
(as every other private person) may pursue them into the other County and may
stay or arrest them there, but the officer cannot bring them out of that
County, but must carry the Affrayors before some Iu. of peace of the same
County where they were taken etc. But if the Affray be in one Town, and the
Affrayors do fly into a franchise or liberty within the same County, the
officer may pursue them, and take them out of the Franchise by fresh suite.

83. See 2. E. 4. C. Br. Tres. 296.
But if the Constable has arrested one upon a warrant from a Justice of peace,
and after the arrest, the party escapes (of his own wrong) and flies into
another County the Constable may pursue and take him in the other County by
fresh suite, and bring him before the Iu. of peace, upon whose warrant he was
first arrested.

84. If a prisoner that is taken in execution shall make an escape of his own
wrong, and shall fly out of sight, and into another County where the Sheriff
has no power, yet the Sheriff, etc. upon fresh suite may take him again in
any other County, and he shall be still said to be in execution yea without fresh
suite the Sheriff etc. may take him again and keep him, until he has
agreed with him, otherwise if the escape were by the consent of the Sheriff
etc. Co. 3. 58. Br. escape. 4. 12.

85. And if a man be arrested for Treason or felony, and the Constable shall
carry him to the Jail and the Jailer will not receive him, 10. H. 4. 7.
the Constable must bring him back to the Town where he was taken, And that
Town shall be charged with the keeping of him, until the next jail delivery,
by the opinion of the book 10. H. 4. Or the Constable or other party, that
arrested him, may in such case keep the prisoner in his own house, as it
seems. See. 11. Ed. 4. Br. Faux. Impris. 25. But the usual and best course
is to bring him before a Justice of peace and to have his mittimus, and then
the Jailer may not refuse him. P. Prison. ^.
But the Jailer denying to receive a felon by the delivery of any Constable or
Towneship, 4. E. 3. ca. 10.
or taking any thing, for receiving such, shall be punished for the same by the
Justices of jail delivery.

When a statute does appoint imprisonment, but limits no time when the offender
shall be imprisoned, The time.
then he is to be imprisoned presently, Co. 8. 119. Plo. 17. b.
as in case of a force the Iu. of P. upon view hereof ought to commit the
offenders presently.

86. Also when a statute does appoint imprisonment, but limits no time how
long, Cromp. 171.
there the prisoner must remain at the discretion of the Court.

87. Where a statute does ordain that an offendour shall be imprisoned at the K.
pleasure, or that a prisoner shall not be delivered without the Kings special
commandment, and that upon a Fine to be made to the King, the Justices before
whom the record is, may assesse the same Fine and deliver him. 18. H. 8. 1. and
Fitz. Na. Br. fol. 190. f.

The manner.
88. Now for the manner of imprisonment generally in all cases where a man is
committed to prison, be it for Treason, felony, or upon an execution, or but
for a Trespass or other offense, every Jailer ought to keep such his
prisoner, Co. 8. 100. and 9. 87.
In salva and arcta Custodia; Salva. sc. that he ought to be imprisoned so
surely as that he cannot escape; Arcta, in respect that he ought to be kept
close without conference with others for intelligence of things abroad.

And therefore if the Jailer shall license his prisoner to go abroad for a
time and then to come again, Or to go abroad with a keeper, though he come
again, yet these are escapes, And if the prisoner were in for Treason or
felony, 1. P. ^. ca. 12. 7. H. 4. ca. 4.
this is fineable in the Jailer at the least, if it be not felony or Treason,
And if the prisoner were in upon an execution, this is so penal to the
officer, as that he shall be charged for the debt, And if the prisoner were in
but for a Trespass, yet the officer is fineable, for imprisonment was ordained
for a punishment of offenders, and in terror of all others, Vt poena ad paucos
metus ad omnes perveniat. Also by the Law, those which are in execution ought
not to go at liberty within the prison, Dyer 249. Co. 3. 44.
nor abroad with their keeper. 24. H. 8. much less in cases of felony or of
higher offenses.

Co. ib. P. Accomptant. 2.
89. Also by the statute of Westminster. 2. ca. 11. Accomptants and such as are
in execution, the Sheriff, or jailer may put Irons or fetters upon them, And
yet if the Jailer shall imprison a man so straightly, by putting him in the
Stocks, or putting more Irons upon him then is needful, Fitz. 93. b.
or keeps his victual from him, whereby the prisoner becomes decrepit,
lamed or otherwise diseased, he shall have an Action of the case against the
Jailer, Also the Constable or other such officer that shall imprison in the
Stocks any offender for felony or suspicion thereof, may lock the stocks, and
if need be may also put Irons upon him as it seems. And when he convayeth him
to the jail, or to the Justice, he may pinyon him or otherwise make him sure
so that he cannot escape.

90. It seems by Britton fol. 17. that by the common Law (before the statute
of Westminster. 2.) None should have Irons put on them, but such offenders as were
taken for felony or trepassers in parkes, But the words of the statute of
Westminster. 2. ca. 11. are general, quod carceri manucipientur in ferris, which
word carceri seems to signify any persons imprisoned for any cause (or any
persons worthy of the, prison) and is not to be restrained to Accomptants only,
See Coke. 3. 44.

91. Where the Iu. of peace, Sheriff, or other Officer, Posse Comitatus.
is enabled to take the power of the County, it seems they may command and
ought to have the aid and attendance of all Knights, Gentlemen, Yeomen,
Husbandmen, Laborers, Tradesmen, Servants and apprentices, and of all other
such persons, being above the age of 15. years, and that are able to travel.

92. But women, Ecclesiastical persons, and such as be decrepit or diseased
of any continual infirmity shall not be compelled to attend them.

93. And in such cases, it is referred to the discretion of the Justices of
peace (or Sheriff etc.) what number they will have to attend upon them, and
how and after what manner they shall be armed, weaponed, or otherwise furnished.
But it is not justifieable for the Iu. of Peace, Sheriff, or other officer to
assemble Posse Comitatus or raise a power or assembly of people (upon their
own heads) without just cause, and therefore it is to be considered upon what
occasion a Justice of peace or other officer may to his assistance take posse
Comitatus.

94. Any Justice of peace or Sheriff may take of that County where he is a
Justice, or Sheriff, any number that they shall think meet, to pursue,
apprehend, arrest and imprison Traitors, Murderers, Robbers and other felons or
such as do break or go about to break or disturb the Kings peace in any
outrageous manner, and every man being required, ought to assist and aid them.

95. The Just. of P. and the Sheriff or undersheriffe, may take Posse
comitatus, for the suppressing of Riots, and all sorts of persons (being able
and required) ought to assist them therein.

96. 14. H. 7. 8.
Yea any one Justice of peace may take the power and aid of the County to
suppress Riottets and needs not to tarry for the coming of another Just. or
of the Sheriff.

97. Also in cases of forceible entry, any Justices of peace may take Posse
comitatus, to remove such persons as by his view, or by Inquisition taken
before him, shall be found to have made any forceible entry (into other men's
possessions) or to detain them with force.

98. The Sheriff or undersheriffe, or Bailiffe etc. if need be, may by the
common Law take the power of the County (what number they shall think good) to
execute the K. process or writ, 3. H. 7. 1. 10. Co. 5. 115. Br. Fine. p. 37.
be it a writ of execution, Replevin, Estreperment, Capias, or other writ, it
being the Kings commandment, Br. Riots. 2. 3.
See the stat. Westminst. 1. 17. Westminst. 2. 39. And such as shall not assist
them therein being required shall pay a Fine to the King. 3. H. 7. 1. Br.
Trespass 266.
The Sheriffs Bailiffe, to execute a Replevin, took with him three hundred
men armed (modo guerino) sc. with Brigandines, Iacks, and Guns, and it was
holden lawful, for the Sheriffs officer has power to take assistance, as well
as the Sheriff himself, for that all is one office, and one Authority.

99. A man demands the P. in Chancery against a great Lord, and has a
Supplicavit directed to the Sheriff, there if need shall be, the Sheriff may
take his Posse comitatus to aid him to arrest such a Lord. So it seems if a
Supplicavit be directed to a Justice of peace, the Justice of peace, or the
officer to whom the Justice of peace shall make his warrant in this behalf
(upon resistance made) may, if need be, take Posse Comitatus to aid him to
arrest the party: Quia quando aliquid mandatur, mandatur and omne per quod
pervenitur ad illud, Co. 5. 115.

100. But besides this, every Sheriff is enabled by his writ of assistance,
whereby there is commandment under the great seal to all Archbishops, Dukes,
Earls, Barons, and all other the Kings subjects within the fame County to be
aiding to him in whatsoever belongs to his office, etc.

101. The Sheriff, if need require it, or the Constable may take Posse
Comitatus to execute the precept of a Justice of peace. 3. H. 7. 10. 13. H. 7.
19. Br. Trespass 432.
The Constable of a Town upon a felony committed, or upon any Affray, or the
like, may take the aid of his neighbors, or other persons being present to
apprehend the Felons, or to cause the peace to be kept, and to carry the
offenders before the Iu. of peace, and if any refuse to aid the Constable in
this case, he is to be punished in the Sessions of the peace by Fine and
imprisonment.

38. Ed. 3. 8.
102. One has hurt another, whereby he is in peril of death, the Constable may
take power or aid to arrest him, etc.

103. Every man may assemble his friends and neighbors to defend his person,
etc. being in his house, against violence, etc. but not to go abroad with him
in a Fair or market.

Advices to the Justices of peace.
104. I thought it not amiss here shortly to admonish the Justices of peace of
some few things, for their better memory.

1. First, that they exercise not the office of a Justice of peace, before they
have taken the oath of their office, and the oath of Supremacy.

2. That they execute not this their office in their own case, but to cause
the offendour to be convented before some other Justice, quia iniquum est
aliquem sui rei esse judicem, Co. 8. 18. And some late statutes have taken
special care to prevent this, as you may see by the statute of 10. Caroli, ca.
23. in hibernia. And yet if the Justice shall deal in his own case, it
seems good and justifiable in diverse cases, as when a Iu. of peace shall be
assaulted, or (in the doing of his office especially) shall be abused to his
face, and no other Justice of peace present with him, then he may commit such
an offender, until he shall find sureties for the peace or good behavior,
(as the case shall require) and the said Justice in such case may himself
bind the offender, and take his surety; but if any other Justice of peace
shall be present, it were better to desire his aid.

3. That they be careful for the execution of the statute of Riots, and if
upon their enquiry of a Riot, the truth cannot be found by reason of any
maintenance, etc. that they certify the same within one month to the Lord
Deputy and Counsel, according to the statute of 13. H. 4. ca. 7.

4. That upon a forceible Entry they make no restitution without Enquiry.

5. That they be circumspect in bayling of prisoners: viz. that they neither
deny it to such as are baileable, nor yield it, where it is not grantable.

6. That all Recognisances taken by them be certified at their next quarter
Sessions, or Jail delivery: according as the case shall require.

7. Also that they do Justice, and give remedy to every party grieved, in any
thing that lies within their power, to hear, determine, or execute, and that
without respect of persons, and according to the laws and statutes of this
Realm.

8. Note that all these former matters are penal to the Justices of peace, if
they shall offend in any of them, and therefore it is likely they will be the
more careful therein. But there are certain other things principally tending
to the public good, and fit to be commended to the care of the Justices of
peace, in all which the Justices of peace are to employ also their special
care and diligence, and they are shortly these following:

1. The abuses, disorders in Alehouses and Innes to be reformed.

2. High ways and Bridges to be amended.

3. Huy and Cry, and fresh suit, to be duly made and pursued, after Rebels,
Robbers, and other Felons and Traitors.

4. Laborers, ( sc. idle persons meet to serve) to be compelled to go to
service, also negligent Recusants, which shall not resort every Sunday to
Church, that such be punished according to the st^tute, for the first means
to bring men to God is to bring them to Church.

4. Rogues and Vagabonds to be duly punished.

5. Houses of correction to be mainetained.

6. Watch to be duly kept.

7. Weights and measures, the abuses therein to be reformed.

8. Further the Iu. of P. are to be careful that they suffer not the King to
be disadvantaged where it lies lawfully in their power to prevent.

9. Also that they remember, how that they exercise not the judgments of men
only but of God himself (whose power they do participate, and who is always
present with them) and therefore must take heed, that in all their actions they
set God continually before their Eyes.

10. But forasmuch as most of the business of the Iu. of P. out of Sessions
consists in the execution of diverse statutes committed to their charge,
which statutes cannot be so sufficiently abridged, but that they will come
short of the substance and body thereof, therefore it shall be safest for the Iu.
of Peace, not to rely overmuch upon these short collections thereof, but to
have an Eye to the Abridgement of those Statutes or rather to the book of
Statutes at large, and thereby to take their further and better directions for
their whole proceedings. For (as Sir Edw. Coke observes) Abridgements are of
good and necessary use to serve as Tables, but not to ground any opinion (much
less to proceed judicially) upon them, Ideo, says he, satius est petere
fontes, quam sectari Rivulos. Coke. 10. 117. b.

11. And lastly for the better encouragement of Iu. of P. Constables and other
officers who (by causeless suits commenced by contentious persons against them
for executing their offices) have lately been discouraged from doing their
offices (with that courage, care and diligence which is required at their
hands) Now for their case in pleading they are by the statute of 10. Caroli in
Ireland allowed to plead the general issue of Not guilty, and to give the
special matter in Evidence, and for their wrongful vexation double Costs.

Barretor. CHAP. 4.
9. E. 4 3.
1. EVery Justice of peace (upon his discretion) may bind to the peace or good
behavior, such as are common Barretors.

2. Now a common Barretor is he, who is either a common mover or stirrer up (or
maintainer) of suits in Law in any Court, Co. 1. 6.
or else of quarrels in the Country.

In Courts.
3. As if in any Court of Record, County Court, hundred, or other inferior
Courts, any person by fraud and malice under color of Law, shall themselves
maintain (or stir up others unto) multiplicitie of unjust and fained suites
or informations (upon penal laws) or shall maliciously purchase special
Supplicavits of the peace, to force others to yield him composition, all such
are Barretors.

4. In the Country, and these are of three sorts.

1. Disturbers of the peace, In the Country.
viz. such as are either common quarrellers, or fighters in their own cause,
or common movers, or maintainers of quarrels and Affrayes between others.

2. Common takers, or detainers by force or subtlety, of the possession of
houses, lands or goods which been in question.

3. Inventers or sowers of false reports, Co. 8. 361.
whereby discord arises between neighbors, all these are Barretors.

5. But all such persons must be common Barretors, Co. 8. 37.
sc. not in one or two, but in many causes.

Bailement and Mainprise. CHAP. 5.
1. BAilement, Mainprise, or Replevin, is the saving or delivery of a man, out
of prison, before that he has satisfied the Law sc. by finding sureties to
answer, and be justified by the Law. And to this purpose these three terms
(Bailement, Mainprise, and Replevin) be indifferently used in our statutes and
books.

2. He that is bayled, Stamf. 65.
is taken or kept out of prison and delivered (as it were) into the hands of
his sureties, who are reputed his guardians, and who may keep him with them,
F. Manip. 12.
and may imprison him by some opinions, See 22. H. 6. Br. Surety 8. and Mainp.
89.

3. By the common law the Sheriff, and every Constable (being conservators of
the peace) might have bailed a suspect of felony, but this authority is taken
from them, and given to the Justices of peace by these statutes following:

4. First by the statute, 1. R. 3. cap. 3. every Justice of peace had authority
(by his discretion) to let to bail persons imprisoned for suspicion of felony.
But forasmuch as after the making of that statute, diverse not being baileable,
were notwithstanding let to Bail, Two Justices.
and so many notable felons escaped, therefore this statute was repealed by the
statute of 3. H. 7. 3. H. 7. cap. 38 Fitz. Na. Br. 251. f.
And thereby any two Justices of peace (the one being of the Quorum) were
enabled to let any prisoners (mainpernable by the Law) to bail to the next
general Sessions of the peace or jail delivery, as the case should require.
After, for that one Justice of peace in the name of himself, and of one other
of his fellow Justices (not making the other Justice privy unto the cause,
wherefore the prisoner should be bailed) did oftentimes by sinister means set
at large great and notable offenders, such as were not baileable, and yet to
hide their affection therein, did signify the cause of their apprehension to
be but only for a suspicion of felony, whereby the said offenders have escaped
unpunished, for reformation whereof by the statute 10. Carol. cap. 18. 10.
Carol. 18.
in Ireland it was enacted, that if it be for Manslaughter, or felony, or
suspicion of manslaughter or felony, in which cases the party is baileable,
then the same Justices must be present together at the time of the said
bailement, and that they must certify (in writing subscribed with their own
hands) the said Bailement at the next general jail delivery to be holden
within the County where the person shall be arrested, or suspected (upon pain
to be fined by the Justices of jail delivery.) Now by the preamble of both
last recited statutes, the mischief seems to be the escape of felons, and
therefore if it be not in case of felony, it seems any one Justice of peace
alone, may bail a prisoner, except where some particular statute shall
otherwise prescribe.

Cromp. 1 57.
5. If the Mainpernors, or sureties, do at any time, or in any case doubt that
their prisoner, or the party by them bailed, will fly, they may take him and
bring him before any Justice of peace, and upon their prayer the said Iu. of P.
may discharge such sureties and commit the party to prison, except he shall
find new sureties such as the Justices shall conceive to be sufficient; So if
a prisoner be bailed by insufficient persons, the Iu. of P. (ex officio) may
cause him to find better sureties, and may commit him till he shall so do,
for the statute of Westminster. 1. ca. 15. requires that such as be bailed, be let
out by sufficient sureties. And although the number, of such sureties, their
sufficiency, and the sum wherein they shall be bound, rests in some sort, in
the discretion of the Iu. yet it is safe for them to take two sureties, at the
least, and those to be men of good ability, especially if the prisoner be in
for felony or suspicion thereof; For if the Justices let out a prisoner upon
insufficient sureties that is committed for suspicion of felony, and appears
not, they shall be fined by the Justices of Assise and jail delivery.

Stamf. 77. 21. H 7. 20.
6. Now Bailement, by the Justices of peace (in case of felony or for any other
matter) is always upon a certain sum of money (as upon 401 etc.) the which
sum the sureties, etc. shall forfeit to the K. if it the prisoner appear not
at his day, And in this business of bailement (being a matter of much weight)
It behooveth the Justices of peace to be very circumspect as well for fear of
wrong, by denying it to him, that is baileable, as also for fear of danger to
the service it self, by yielding it where it is not grantable, and for fear
of danger to themselves in both cases. 3. E. 1. 15.
For whosoever does detain prisoners who are baileable after they have offered
sufficient sureties, See 23. H. 6. ca. 10.
shall be grievously amerced to the K. and he that does take any reward for the
deliverance of such, shall be amerced to the K. and pay double to the prisoner.

7. So on the other side, if one who by the Law, is not baileable, shall be let
to mainprise, this shall be adjudged a negligent escape in him or them that do
let him to main prise, (...)
and for such an escape or offense they shall be fined and punished as follows,
videlicet: If the ^heriffe, Constable or any Bailiffe of Fee, who has the
keeping of prisoners shall bail any person which is not baileable, and be
thereof attainted, they shall loose their Fee and office for ever, 3. Ed. 1.
ca. 15.
and if the undersheriffe, Constable or Bailiffe of such as have Fee for
keeping of prisoners, do it contrary to their masters will, or any other
Bailiffe being not of Fee, they shall have three years imprisonment and make
Fine at the Kings pleasure.

8. Note that the Sheriffs and other officers which do let to bail any
persons forbidden (by the statute, 3. Ed. 1. cap. 15.) to be bayled shall be
punished by the Justices of jail delivery, according to the form of the same
statute, or else by the said Justices they may be put to their fine, as for an
escape, punishable at the common Law. 25. Ed. 3. 39.

9. By the Justices
If any Justices of peace do let to bail or mainprise any person who for any
offense by him committed is declared not to be baileable, or forbidden to be
bailed by the aforesaid statute of 3. 10. Caroli ca. 18. P. Just. 108. P.
Mainp. 4.
Edw. 1. the said Justices of peace so offending shall pay such fines, as
shall be assessed by the Justices of jail delivery where the offense shall be
committed, Fitz. 251. 1.

10. Now to show further the authority of the Iu. of P. in this behalf; No
person arrested for Manslaughter, or felony, or suspicion thereof (being
baileable by the Law) shall be let to bail or mainprise, by any Iu. of P. but
in open Sessions, 10. Caroli. ca. 1^. in Ireland.
or by two Iu. of P. at the least, whereof one to be of the Quorum, and the
same Justices to be present together, at the time of the said bailement. The
manner.
And this bailement the said Justices shall certify in writing subscribed with
their hands at the next general jail delivery etc. and in default thereof to
be fined by the Justices of jail delivery, 3. H. 7. ca. 3. 10. Caroli ca. 18
in Ireland.
Also before the bailement of such prisoner the same Justices or one of them
shall take the examination of the prisoner, and information of them that bring
him, of the fact and circumstances thereof, and so much thereof as shall be
material to prove the felony, shall put in writing before they make the
bailement, which examination, information, and bailement, they shall certify
at the next general jail delivery upon the penalty to be fined (as aforesaid)
at the discretion of the Justices.

11. But if any Iu. of P. has taken the examination of a felon, and
information against him, and after has sent him to the jail, now upon
bailement of him by other Justices they need not to take any new examination of
the prisoner, or information against him, but under their Recog. (or together
therewith) to certify by what Iu. of P. the felon was committed, to the end
that at his hands those examinations and Informations may be required, if he
have not certified them, nevertheless it is not amiss if they take new
examinations, and informations, for if the prisoner or accusers vary in their
examinations, good use may be made thereof for the discovery of the truth.

12. Mittimus, the form.
Also the Justice of peace which small send any prisoner to the jail, ought to
show in their Mittimus the cause of the commitment to the end it may appear
whether such prisoner be baileable or no. And if the Justices of P. shall
commit one to the jail with these words in the Mittimus, sc. without bail or
mainprise showing a certain cause in their Mittimus, yet if such a prisoner be
baileable by Law, other Justices of peace may bail him, but if the prisoner
were committed without bail or mainprise, and without showing cause in the
Mittimus, then other Justices of peace cannot, or at least shall not do well
to bail him without making the other Justice which committed him privy
thereto, for he might be committed for such cause, as that he is not baileable
(as for Treason etc.)

14. H. 7. 10. 2.
13. Note where a man is baileable yet when he comes before the Justice he
must offer surety to the Justices, otherwise they may commit him to prison.

14. Next it follows that I show what persons be baileable and what not,
Persons not baileable.
It appears by the statute of West. 1. ca. 15. but in these four cases
following a man was not baileable at the Common Law. Br. Manip. 47. Stamf. 71.
F. N. B. 66. E. First no person taken for the death of a man sc. for murder,
Br. Manip. 11. 47. 57. 60. 63. 78. F. Coro. 361.
or any other homicide was baileable by the common Law. And yet the Justices of
the Kings Bench did use to bail them yea although it be for Murder. Br. Mainp.
60. 63. 78. 47.

10. Carol. ca. 18. in Ireland.
15. Also the statute of 10. Caroli in Ireland seems to admit that for
manslaughter and all other homicide (except murder only) the slayer may be
bailed by the Justices of peace, which also is the common practice at this day,
but let the Justices of peace be sparing and well advised herein viz. that the
offense be but manslaughter and not murder.

16. Also it seems the Justices of peace cannot bail him that has committed
manslaughter, if either he has confessed the offense upon his examination, Or
that he be taken with the manner, Or that it be apparently known that he
killed the other, for then it is more then suspicion, but he that has
dangerously hurt another may go under bail.

17. Likewise no person taken by the Kings commandment was baileable by the
common Law, but this must be intended of the Kings commadement by his own
mouth or by his privy counsel which are incorporate to him, Stamf. 73.
See Stamf. 72. and Br. Mainp. 37. 47. neither was any person taken by the
commandment of the Kings Justices baileable by the common Law, but this must
be intended of their absolute commandment as if the Justice commands one to
prison without showing cause why he does so command, or for misdemeanour done
in his presence, or for some other cause which lies in the discretion of the
Justices more then in his ordinary power.

P. Just. 107.
18. But now for that by the statute 10. Caroli. ca. 18. It is provided that no
Just. or Justices of P. shall let to bail any person contrary to the aforesaid
statute of Westminster. 1. (made 3. Ed. 1.) ca. 15. And so the said statute of Westminster.
1. is now as a line whereby the Justice of peace are to guide themselves in
cases of Bailement, I will show here what persons are baileable by that statute
of Westminster. 1. and what not.

19. By the statute of Westminster. 1. no prisoner, shall be let to bail, 3. Ed. 1.
15. P. Mainp. 1. F. N. B. 66. c.
which is taken in any of these twelve cases following:

1. First, such as have abjured the Realm shall not be bailed.

2. Stamf. 144. b.
Nor any approver or appellor (for that he confesses) the felony and himself
guilty, before he can burden or accuse another, as coadjutor or helper with
him in doing the same.

3. Nor he which is appealed by an approver, Fitz. 250. D. Br. Mainp. 97.
so long as the approver does live, except he be of good name, or that the
Approver does waive his appeal See Stamf. 74.

4. Nor he which is taken for burning of burning of a house, etc. feloniously.

5. Nor any excommunicate person taken (at the Bishops request) ( sc upon his
certificate) by the writ of Excom. capiend. F. N. B. 66.

6. Nor any felon taken with the manner, or taken for a manifest offense.

7. Nor a Thief openly defamed and known.

8. Nor he which is outlawed, and yet in some cases such as be outlawed, may be
bailed by the Court, etc. See Stamf. 74.

9. Nor he which has broken the Kings prison.

10. Nor he which is taken for Treason.

11. Nor he which is taken for falsifying the Kings money.

12. Nor he which counterfeiteth the Kings seal, Br. Mainp. 59.

20. But by the same statute of West. 1. Persons bai^eable. West. 1. 15. P.
Mainp. 2. Persons suspect.
such persons are baileable, which be taken in any of these cases following:

1. First, he that is taken (or indicted) for light suspicion of felony, is
baileable, F. N. Br. 249. g. 250. c. 251. f.

2. He that is taken upon suspicion of burglary, robbery, or theft, Stamf. 74.
c.
if he be not of evil fame, nor that there be any strong presumption against
him, it seems he is baileable.

3. A man had stolen certain hoggs, 16. E. 4. 5. Br. Mainp. 75.
and (for that he was of evil fame) he was committed without bail, yet if he
could have brought proof or witness that he bought them, he should have
been bailed.

4. A man is arrested for suspicion of felony, and brought before the Justice,
if it shall appear there is no such felony committed, Cromp. 15.
the party may be set at liberty without bail; but if there, be a felony
committed, and any probability that the prisoner is guilty, although in truth
he be not guilty, yet the Justice must either commit him, or bail him.

5. Pery Larceny, B. Mainp. 2. Fitz. 150. E.
He that is taken (or indicted) for pety Larceny that amounts not above the
value of xijd, if he were not guilty of some Larceny before, he is baileable.

6. Persons indicted. P. Mainp. 2.
Such as be indicted of Larceny (generally) shall be set at liberty upon
sufficient surety.

21. And yet they shall not be bailed, if they be not also of good fame, Stamf.
74. Fitz. 1. 9. and 250. Br. Mainp. 97.
but if they be of good fame they may be bayled (although they be indicted) by
the Justices that have authority to hear and determine felony, yet the
Justices of peace out of their Sessions may not safely bail such persons, for
being indicted they are then more then vehemently suspected.

22. One that was indicted before the Coroner, that he had killed another Se
defendendo, was by the Justices of jail delivery bailed till the next Assizes
to purchase his pardon, 26. Eliz. Cromp. 153.

Fitz. Na. br. fo. 249. g.
23. One that was indicted in the Sheriffs Turn for stealing of a horse may be
bailed by the Sheriff (if he be of good fame) as appears by the writ de
manucaptione F. N. B. 249. g. Also one that was indicted of Burglary, as
principal pleaded not guilty and was after bailed 29. lib. Ass. Fitz. Mainp.
9. Another that was indicted of Robbery was bailed 41. lib. Ass. 30. Br. Mainp.
61. but these were bailed by the Court and not by a Justice of peace in the
Country.

Persons attaint or convict. Stamf. 74. D. F. Cor. 297. 354.
24. But such as are attainted or convicted of felony are not baileable, for
although it does not appear by any words of the said statute of Westminst. 1.
that it does prohibit the bailement of such as be convicted by verdict, yet it
is to be intended that the statute does as well prohibit the bailement of those
convicted and attainted by verdict, as it does of them who be attainted by
Outlarie, And therefore if a prisoner after he has pleaded not guilty be
convicted by verdict that be killed a man Se defendendo, 25. E. 3. 42.
or by misfortune, yet he shall not be bailed by the opinion of some books.
Nevertheless the Justices of Assise use to bail the prisoners that are found
guilty Se defendendo or per infortunium taking security, by recognizance that
the prisoner at the next Assizes shall appear and produce his pardon of grace,
And this I conceive to be legal enough for avoiding of charge and circuit,
for if the prisoner procure a certificate of the verdict into the Chancery, it
appears by Stamford. fo. 74. that a writ shall issue to the Sheriff to bail
him.

Dyer. 179. See Br. Mainp. 94.
25. And if a man that is arraigned of homicide does plead not guilty, and is
found guilty and does pray his Clergy, and is reprived without judgment, he
is not baileable, for being convicted of the felony, he is more now then
vehemently suspected, and the intendment of Law in cases of Bailement is, that
it rests indifferent whether he be guilty or not until Trial, etc.

26. The same reason seems to hold if a man be indicted of homicide (before
the Coroner) yet See 22. Ass. p. 94. Br. Cor. 90. that such are baileable as
are indicted before the Coroner but of Manslaughter, and so is the common
practice at this day.

27. Also a man convicted of felony remains in prison, and after obtains
the K. pardon, the Just. of jail delivery may bail him till the next jail
delivery, that he may then come with his pardon and plead it 2. E. 6. Br.
Manip. 94.

28. Stamf. 1.
Those that be charged as accessaries in felony be baileable and it seems
that accessaries to felonies are within the Equity of this statute, Stamf. 71.
c. Fitz. 250. c. Br. Main. 11. 58.
and are baileable (if they be of good fame) until the principal be convict
or attaint, but after the principal is attainted the accessory shall not be
bailed but kept in prison, 40 E 3. f. 28. Stamf. 71. c. Br. Main. 58.
and yet if (after the attainder of the principal) the accessory shall plead
not guilty or other plea, it seems he shall be bailed, See more in Br. Mainp.
6. 9. 22. 54. 64. and 97.

29. If a man be accessory to two, Stamf. 71. F. Cor. 200.
and the one principal is attainted, though the other be not, yet the
accessory shall not be bailed.

30. In felony if the principal dye in prison; or be attainted of another
felony the accessory shall be bailed, F. Coro. 378. Br. Mainp. 91.

31. Also the said statute of Westminster. 1. cap. 15. does no more restrain the
principals (to be bailed) then the accessaries in those cases where the same
statute does not prohibit to let to Mainprise, Stamf. 74. Br. Main. 53. F.
Mainp. 9.
and therefore if a man be indicted of Burglary as principal, yet he may be
bailed, Stamf. 74. Stamf. 74.
Also the principal in appeal of Robbery may be bailed, And so may he be
bailed upon an Indictment of Robbery. Br. 61. 75. and 97. Stamf. 71. Br. 56.
58. 97.
But the principal for murder is not baileable either by the common Law, or by
the stat. of Westminst. 1. by the Justices of peace or by the Sheriff, but the
Justices of the Kings Bench do use to bail them for they are not restrained
neither by the common Law nor by the said statute, Trespass West. 1. 15. P.
Mainp. 2.
howbeit I do advise the Justices of peace to be sparing in the bailement
either of Burglars, Robbers or other notorious felons, and to take very good
sureties for such as they shall bail.

32. Those that be charged with (or guilty of) any Trespass that touches not
loss of life, nor member, be baileable by the statute of Westminster. 1. 15. before
they be convicted. But yet let the Justice of peace have a Care that bail be
not prohibited by any other latter statute (in such cases of Trespass.)

33. If any person be committed to prison, Fitz. 250. g.
by process from the Sessions made upon an Indictment upon any penal statute
(not prohibiting bail) he maybe bailed (out of the Sessions) by two Justices
of peace the one being of the Quorum. Br. 97.
Or he may have a writ out of the Chancery directed to the Justices of peace,
or to the Sheriff to take surety of him for his appearance, before the Justices
at their Sessions, Or he may have a Cerciorari to remove the record into the
Kings Bench, and a habeas corpus to remove the body thither also. Fitz. 250. g.
h. i. and 251. c.

34. If process from the Sessions shall go forth upon any indictment of
Trespass, Cromp. 197. 134.
etc. any one Justice of peace may take bail of the party to appear at the
day, etc. to answer to the indictment, and the same Iu. may thereupon make his
Supersedeas, for otherwise besides the mischief of imprisonment, the party may
be outlawed before the Sessions: Note that the Justices of peace are not to
bail any prisoner, except the prisoner be committed for such cause whereof the
said Justices of peace may neither enquire, hear, ^or determine; Cromp. 152.
and therefore if a man be taken upon process of rebellion, issuing out of the
Chancery or Star Chamber, or such like, the Justices of peace are not to bail
him. And Master Crompton reports of two Justices of peace, who were fined for
bailing one, in such a case.

35. Also if a man be arrested by force of any process, writ, bill, or warrant,
in any action personal, the Justices of peace are not to bail him.

36. Persons condemned in any of the Kings Courts, and by virtue thereof
committed to prison. And persons being in execution upon any statute or
recognisance, etc. at the suit of any person the Iu. of P. are not to bail any
such.

Execution. P. Mainp. 2. Fitz. 250. d.
37. He that is appealed by an approver, being no common thief, nor defamed,
after the death of the Approver, is baileable by the statute of West. 1.

38. Note that a man cannot become an Approver, before a Justice of peace;
Stamf. 144. 2.
nevertheless it seems both reasonable and serviceable, that if a felon will
become an Approver, that is, will confess his felony, and also accuse others
(that were coadjutors with him in doing the same felony, or in other felonies,)
before a Justice of peace, that such Justice may take his confession, and
commit him to the jail, and may also grant out his warrant for the
apprehending of the others, that are so accused.

39. Again, the statute of 23. H. 6. c. 10. takes away bail from all such as
be in prison by condemnation, execution, Capias utlagatum, excommunication,
surety for the peace, or by the special commandment of any Justice
prohibiting that such be not bailed, either by the Sheriff, or other officer
or minister.

40. There be diverse other statutes which do take away bail from the
offenders thereof, and that not only upon their solemn conviction after
public hearing, trial, and judgment, but also upon the record of one or two
Justices of peace, or by private examination, and confession of the offendour,
or proof of witnesses, or such other private trial, had before the Justices
of peace out of their Sessions, most of which I have here set down, whereof
the Justices of the peace (as I said before) are to be careful.

1. No person being imprisoned or taken for any of the offenses, or causes
here-under mentioned, Where Bail is taken away. 13. E. 1. ca. 11.
shall be bailed or let to Mainprise, otherwise then as hereafter follows,
sc. Accomptants found in arrearages before Auditors shall be imprisoned,
without bail until they have satisfied their Master all arrearages.

2. Appellors, or approvers, shall not be bailed. West. 1. cap. 15. Nor he
which is appealed by an Approver. Ibid.

3. Persons going or riding armed contrary to the statute of Northhampton, and
being thereof convict, shall be imprisoned until they have paid such Fine as
shall be therefore imposed upon them.

4. Breakers of prison are not baileable. Westminster. 1. 15.

5. Surveyors and Collectors, 10. Caroli. ca. 20. in Ireland.
appointed for the repairing of Bridges, if they refuse to account of the money
by them received, they shall be imprisoned until they have truly accounted.

6. Burners of houses, or Ricks of Corn in Town or fields, 13. H. 8. ca. 1.
in Ireland.
are not baileable, for these offenses in Ireland are Treason.

7. Constables neglecting to whip Trespassers in Corn, woods, or Orchards at
the commandment of a Justice of peace shall be imprisoned until they have
caused the offendour to be whipped. 10. Caroli ca. 23.


8. Persons condemned in any of the Kings Courts, See 23. H. 6. cap. 10.
and by virtue thereof committed to prison, they shall not be bailed, until
they have agreed with the plaintiff. 1. R. 2. c. 12. 2. H. 5. c. 2. Fitz. N.
B. 121. A.

9. Conjurers and Witches shall not be bailed.

10. Counterfeiters of the Kings seal, or money, are not baileable. West. 1.
cap. 15.

11. Excommunicate persons, Where bail is taken away. West. 1. 15. See 23. H.
6. ca. 10.
taken by a writ de excommunicato capiendo shall not be bailed.

12. Such persons as are in execution upon any statute or recognizance, or upon
judgment given in the Kings Courts at the suit of any person, shall not be
bailed until they have agreed with the plaintiff. 1. R. 2. ca. 12. 23. H. 6.
ca. 10. Fitz. N. Br. fol. 93. c. and 121 a.

13. Felons taken for murder are not baileable, but if it be but for
Manslaughter they may be bailed. But felons taken with the manner are not
baileable, Westminster, 1. cap. 15. Or if it be apparently known that they
did the felony, they are not baileable.

14. Or if they confess the felony upon their examination before the Just. of
P. Cromp. 152. B. Or if he be a Thief openly known, West. 1. 15. Or if he be
of evil fame by credible report. Br. Mainp. 75. in all these cases they are
not baileable.

15. Yet in these former cases of felony, if the theft be not above the value
of Twelve pence, the Justices of peace may bail the prisoner, it being no
felony of death.

16. Nor he which is convict, or attaint of felony, is not baileable.

17. Also persons convict of Forceible Entry, or detainer shall not be bailed
until they have paid their Fine, or have found sureties by recognizance for
payment thereof.

18. Forgers of any deed, writing sealed, will, or Court Roll, and the
assenters thereto, and the publishers thereof knowing the same, 28. Eliz. ca.
4. in Ireland.
shall not be bailed if they be convicted thereof, but every of the offenders
aforesaid (in all cases of forgery) being thereof convicted, shall suffer
perpetual imprisonment during their lives, where any man's estate of
inheritance, Freehold, or Coppy-hold shall be defeated, charged, or molested
thereby, otherwise the offenders shall suffer one years imprisonment without
bail.

10. Caroli ca. 3. in Ireland.
19. Persons convicted of making fraudulent conveyances their defenders,
Iustifyers, or putters thereof in ure knowing the same, and those which shall
assign over any lands, leases or goods so to them convayed, knowing the same,
shall suffer imprisonment one half year without bail.

20. Maintainers of houses, or places for any unlawful game, and common
gamesters, every Justice of Peace seeing or finding any such may imprison the
offenders till they find sureties by recognisance no more to offend in the
premises or for their good behavior, and this he may do by the common Law,
and by the first Assignavimus of the Commission of the peace, and the
offenders shall not be bailed without finding such bonds.

10. Caroli ca. 26.
21. Collectors for highways, bridges, Causeys or Toghers which shall refuse
to account for the money by them collected shall be imprisoned until they have
accounted for and paid the same, and shall not be bailed.

22. Hunting, if any lay man not having in lands 40. s. per annum, Or if any
Priest or Clerk, not having 10.l. living per annum, shall keep any hound,
greyhound, or other dog for to hunt, or any Ferrets, hayes, nets, or other
engines to take or destroy Dear, Hare, Conyes, or other Gentlemen's game, and
shall be thereof convicted, every such offendour shall be imprisoned for one
whole year, and not bailed. 13. R. 2. ca. 13.

23. Reporters of false news which may cause discord between the King and his
people, and spreaders of false news or lies of any of the Peers or great
officers of the Realm if they be thereof convicted shall be imprisoned until
they have brought him into the Court who was first author of the tale, and
shall not be bailed, 3. E. 1. ca. 33. 2. R. 2. ca. 5.

23. H. 6. ca. 10.
24. No person committed by the King, or Counsels commandment, nor by any of
the K. Just. shall be bailed.

25. So in all cases, where a statute ordains that an offender shall be
imprisoned at the Kings will and pleasure there the prisoner cannot be bailed
or delivered until the King has signified his pleasure of him (as if one be
imprisoned for going or riding armed contrary to the statute of North-hampton
made Anno 2. E. 3. ca. 3.) 24. E. 3. f. 3. Br. contempts 6.

26. And in such cases the prisoner is to redeem his liberty with some portion
of money as he can best agree with the King or his Justices for the same, And
so it seems the Iu. before whom such an offendour shall be convict, may
assesse such Fine or ransom, according to their discretions, and upon payment
thereof may deliver the prisoner out of prison, for the King signifies therein
his pleasure by the mouths of his Justices.

27. Servants departing from their masters without good cause, and persons
compellable to serve, that upon request made shall refuse to serve for the
wages rated and appointed by proclamation and being committed for that cause
are not baileable.

28. Such persons as at their proper Costs, shall buy, 8. H. 6. 4.
or wear any Liveries, clothes, or hats, to have maintenance and be thereof
convicted, shall have one whole years imprisonment without bail.

Mag Chart. 15. P. tit. Ways. 1.
1. NO village, or freemen by the common Law shall be compelled to make any

31. 21. E. 4. 46.
or that they hold certain lands to make the same, for though a man of his
own accord has made or amended a Bridge, yet shall he not be thereto
constrained at another time, and yet if a man and his ancestors, or a
corporation, etc. have time out of mind used to do such things, although they
did it of their own free mind and accord, and not of right, yet such
continuance shall conclude them and their heirs and successors. And so of
highwayes, 21. Ed. 4. 46.

proportionably to their profit.

such lands are to be charged proportionably to their said lands.

7. But now by a statute made in Anno. 10. Caroli. ca. 26. It is enacted that
as well the Justices of Assize in their several circuits; as also the Justices
of peace in every Shire of this Realm, Franchise, City, or Borough, shall
have power and authority to enquire, hear, and determine publicly in the
general Assizes or Sessions of the peace respectively, of all manner of
annoynances of Bridges, Causeys, and Toghers, broken or decayed in the high
ways, to the damage of the Kings liege people. And also of and concerning the
new building, erecting and making of new Bridges, Causeys, and Toghers, broken
or decayed in the highways, to the damage of the Kings liege people, and also
of and concerning the new building, erecting and making of new Bridges,
Causeys, or Toghers, in other places fit and necessary for the fame, and to
make such process and peines upon every presentment before them respectively,
for the reformation of the same against such as ought to be charged for the
making or amending of such Bridges, Causeys, and Toghers, as the Kings Justices
of his Bench use commonly to do, or as it shall seem by their discretions to
be necessary and convenient for the speedy amendment, erecting and making of
such Bridges, Causeys, and Toghers, and every or any of them. And where in many
parts of this Realm, it cannot be known and proved what County, Barony,
City, Borough, Town, or parish, nor what person certain, or body politic,
ought of right to make or repair such Bridges, Causeys, or Toghers, by reason
whereof such Bridges, Causeys, and Toghers, for lack of knowledge of such as
ought to make or repair them, for the most part lie without making or
repairing to the great annoyance of the Kings subjects. It is further enacted
that in every such case the said Bridges, Causeys, and Toghers, if they be
without City, or Town corporate, shall be made by the Inhabitants of the
Shire or Barony within the which the said Bridges, Causeys, and Toghers shall
happen to be in decay, or thought fit to be newly erected or made. And if
within any City, or Town corporate which is a County of it self, then by the
Inhabitants of every such City, or Town corporate wherein such Bridges,
Causeys, and Toghers, or any of them happen to be in decay or thought fit to be
newly erected and made, and if within a Town corporate which is no County,
then by the County or Barony wherein such Bridges, Causeys, or Toghers shall
happen to be or thought fit to be newly erected; and if part of any such
Bridges, Causeys, and Toghers, or any of them happen to be in one County and
the other part thereof in another County that then in every such case, the
Inhabitants of both the said Counties shall be charged, and chargeable to
amend, make and repair such part and portion of such Bridges, Causeys, and
Toghers, or any of them as shall lie and be within the limits of the Shire
wherein they be inhabiting and dwelling.

8. And it is further enacted that in every such case the said Justices of
Assise in their Circuits, and the said Justices of the peace in the Quarter
Sessions respectively, with the assent of the Grand Jury, shall have power and
authority to tax and set every Inhabitant in any such County, Barony, City,
Borough, Town, or parish, within the limits of their Commissions and
authorities, to such reasonable aid and sum of money as they shall think by
there discretions convenient and sufficient, for the new building, repairing,
re-edifying and amendment of such Bridges, Causeys, and Toghers, and after such
taxations made, the Justices of Assize, and Justices of peace respectively,
shall cause the names and sums of every particular person so by them taxed to
be written in a Roll indented, and shall also have power and authority to make
two Collectors of every Barony, City, Borough, Town, or Parish, for
collection of all such sums of money by them set and taxed, with Collectors
receiving the one part of the said Roll indented, under the seals of the said
Justices shall have power and authority to collect and receive all the
particular sums of money therein contained, and to distraine every such
Inhabitants as shall be taxed and refuse payment thereof in his lands, goods,
and Chattells, and to sell such distress, and of the sale thereof, retain and
perceive all the money taxed and the residue (if the distress be better) to
deliver to the owner thereof: And that the same Justices of Assize, and
Justices of the peace respectively, within the limits of their Commissions and
authorities, shall also have power and authority to name and appoint two
Surveyors which shall see every such Bridge, Causey, and Togher builded,
repaired, and amended from time to time, as often as need shall require, to
whose hands the said Collectors shall pay the said sums of money taxed, and
by them received: And that the Collectors, and Surveyors, and every of them and
their Executors, and administrators, and the Executors, and administrators of
them and every of them from time to time, shall at the public Sessions of the
peace, make a true declaration and account to the Justices of peace of the
Shire, City, or Town corporate, wherein they shall be appointed Collectors,
or Surveyors, of the receipts, payments and expenses of the said sums of
money. And if they or any of them, refuse that to do, that then the Justices
of the peace from time to time by their discretions, shall have power and
authority to make process against the said Collectors, and Surveyors, and
every of them their Executors, and administrators, and the Executors, and
administrators of every of them by Attachments under their seals, returneable
at the general Sessions of the peace; And if they appear, then to compel
them to account as is aforesaid, or else if they or any of them refuse that to
do, then to commit such of them as shall refuse toward, there to remain
without bail or mainprise, till the said declaration and account be truly
made.

9. And lastly it is enacted by the said statute, that the Justices of Assize,
and Justices of the peace respectively, shall have full power and authority to
allow such reasonable costs and charges to the said Surveyors, and Collectors,
as by their discretions shall be thought convenient.

10. Now concerning highways, although by the ancient common Law, every
Country ought to maintain and repair ways and passages between Market
Towns, yet for the better performance thereof, diverse ancient statutes have
been made, viz. the statute of Winchester in the time of E. 1. whereby it is
ordained that the ways should be so enlarged that no bushes should be within
200. foot, and the statute of 11. Iacobi ca. 7. 11. Iacobi ca. 7. in Ireland.
whereby it is ordained that Constables and Churchwardens of every Parish
within this Realm, shall yearly upon the Tuesday and wednesday in Easter
week call together a number of the parishioners, and shall then elect and
choose two honest persons of the parish to be Surveyors, and orderers of the
works for the amendment of the high ways, Cashes, and paces in their parish,
leading to any market Town, the which persons have authority by virtue of that
Act to order and direct the persons and carriages that shall be appointed for
those works by their discretions, and the said persons so named shall take
upon them the execucution of their said offices, upon pain every of them
making default to forfeit ten pounds.

11. And the said Constables and Churchwardens shall also then name and appoint
six days for the amendment and clearing of the said highways, cashes and
paces in the said several parishes before the feast of Saint John Baptist then
next following, and shall openly in the Church the next Sunday after Easter,
give notice of the same six days, and upon the said days the parishioners
shall endeavor themselves to the amendment and clearing of the said ways,
cashes and paces, and shall be chargeable thereunto as follows, that is to
say all and every person, or persons for every plow land in tillage or pasture
that he, she, or they, shall occupy in the same parish, and all and every
other person or persons keeping therein a draught or plow shall find and send
at every day and place to be appointed for the amendment of the highways in
that parish, as is aforesaid, one Wayne, or Cart, furnished after the custom
of the Country with Oxen, horses, or other Cattle, and all other necessaries
meet to carry things convenient for that purpose, and also two able men with
the same, upon pain of every draught making default, twenty shillings.

12. And at every day and place to be appointed for the mending of the Cashes
and clearing of the said paces two able persons furnished with necessary
tools for that purpose, upon pain of every default ten shillings, and every
householder, and every cottier and labourer of that parish able to labor, and
being no hired servant by the year, shall by themselves or one sufficient
labourer, for every of them upon every of the said six days, work and
travel in the amendment of the said highways, Cashes, or paces, upon pain
of every person making default, to lose for every day two shillings.

13. And if the carriages of the parish, or any of them shall not be thought
needful by the supervisors to be occupied upon any of the said days for the
amendment of the said highways, that then every such person that should have
sent any such carriage, shall send to the said work for every carriage so
spared, two able men there to labor for that day upon pain to lose for every
man, not so sent to the said work, two shillings.

14. And every person and carriage abovesaid shall bring with them such
Shovels, Spades, Pickaxes, Mattocks, Axes and other Tools and instruments as
shall be necessary for the said work, and all and every the said persons and
carriages shall do and keep their work as they shall be appointed by the said
supervisors, or one of them, eight hours of every the said days, unless they
shall be otherwise licenced by the supervisors or one of them.

15. And further, that it shall and may be lawful to all and singular
supervisor, and supervisors, and Orderers of the said work for the time being,
for the amendment of the said highways and Cashes, thereunto elected and
appointed as aforesaid, for the better repairing and amendment of the
highways, and making of Cashes in their several parishes and limits, where
they shall be so made supervisors, if it shall so to them be thought necessary,
to take and carry away of the rubbish or small broken stones of any quarrie or
quarries, and to cut and carry away any underwoods, growing, lying or being
within the parish where they shall be supervisors without license, controlement
or impeachment of the owners or owner, so much as by their discretion shall be
deemed and adjudged necessary to the amendment of the said ways and Cashes,
the owners of the said underwoods notwithstanding to be paid for the same by
the parishes, as the same shall be valued by the said supervisors, and that for
default of any quarry or quarries, not being within their said parish or
limits, or in default of rubbish not to be found in any such quarry or
quarries, it shall and may be lawful to any such supervisors or supervisor for
the use aforesaid, in the several grounds of any person or persons being
within the parish and limits where they shall be supervisors, and
nigh-adjoyning to the way or ways wherein such reparations shall be thought
necessary to be made, where gravel, sand, or sinders, is likely to be found to
dig or cause to be dug for gravel, sand, or sinders, and likewise to
gather stones lying upon any lands or grounds within the parish, and meet to
be used to such services and purposes, and thereof to take and carry away so
much as by the discretion of the said supervisors shall be thought necessary to
be applied in the amendment of the said highways.

16. Provided always that it shall not be lawful to any such supervisor or
supervisors to cause any rubbish to be dug out of any quarry or quarries,
but only shall extend to such rubbish as shall be found there ready dug by
the owner or owners of the said quarry or quarries, or otherwise by his or
their license and commandment, nor to dig or cause to be dug any gravel,
sand or sinder in the house, garden, Orchard, or meadow, of any person or
persons, nor to cause any more pits to be dug for gravel in any several or
enclosed ground then one only; and that the same pit or hole so dug for
gravel, as aforesaid, shall not be any way in breadth and length above ten
yards at the most, and every such supervisor as shall cause any such pit to be
made and dug for gravel, sand or sinder, as aforesaid, shall within one
month next after any such digging, or pit made, cause the same to be filled
and stopped up with earth, at the costs and charges of the parishioners, upon
pain to forfeit to the owner, or owners of the soil where any such pit shall
be made and dug, for every default five pounds to be recovered by action of
debt, as in other like cases of debt have been accustomed.

17. And forasmuch as the highways in sundry places of this Realm are full
of Bogges, continual springs, of watercourse, by continual increase and
sinking whereof into the ground, the said ways are not only deep and very
dangerous, but also for the most part impossible to be amended and repaired in
any good and sufficient manner, it is therefore further enacted that every such
supervisor or supervisors shall within the parish or limits where he or they
shall be supervisors, have full power, and authority, to make Cashes of such
Bogges, and to turn any such course or spring of water being in any of the
said highways, into any ditch or ditches of the several ground or soil of
any person or persons whatsoever, next adjoining to the said ways, in such
manner and form as by the discretions of the said supervisors shall be thought
meetest and most convenient.

18. And further also, that the hayes, fences, ditches or hedges next
adjoining, on either side, to any high or common or Fairing way, shall from
time to time be ditched, scoured, repaired, and kept low, and all Trees and
Bushes growing in the highways, or paces cut down by the owner or owners of
the ground or soil, which shall be enclosed with the said hayes, Fences,
ditches or hedges aforesaid, whereby the said ways may be open, and the people
have more ready and easy passage in the same, upon pain that all and every
person and persons making default therein shall forfeit and loose Twenty pounds.

19. And it is further enacted that all and every person or persons that shall
occupy or plow land in tillage, or pasture, lying or being in several parishes
shall be chargeable to the making of the high ways and Cashes: and cutting or
clearing of Paces within the parishes where he dwells, as far forth and in
such manner and form, as any person having a plow-land in any parish ought to
be chargeable by the said Act as aforesaid: and that every person or persons
occupying or keeping in his or their hand, or possession, several or diverse
plow-lands, as aforesaid, in several or diverse parishes, shall be charged to
find in each parish, where the plow-lands being in his occupying do lie, one
Cart, Waine, Tumbrell, Dungpot, or Courtslad, Carres, or drags furnished, and
two men and other things as before, for the amendment and repairing of the
highways, making of Cashes, and clearing of Paces within the several
parishes where the said plow-lands do lie, in such manner and form as if he,
or they were a parishioner dwelling within the parishes where the same several
plow-lands do lie. And for the better keeping of the highwayes passable for
his Majesty's subjects: It is likewise enacted that no person or persons having
any ground by lease or otherwise, adjoining to any highway or common fairing
way leading to any market Town shall cast or scour any ditch, and throw and
lay the soil thereof into the high way, and suffer it to lie there by the
space of six months, to the annoyance of the said high way or common fairing
way, upon pain of forfeiture for every load of soil, so cast into the high
way or common fairing way, in ditching or scouring, twelve pence: and where any
heretofore have been so cast into the highways, or common fairing way, that
there is a bank between the said way and ditch, that it shall be lawful for
the supervisors and workmen appointed for the amendment of the said highways
to make sluices, or other devices by their discretions to convay the water out
of the said way into the ditch, any Law, right, interest, custom, or usage
notwithstanding.

20. And it is further enacted that all and every Justices of Assise, Justices
of Oyer, and Terminer, and Justices of the peace, in their Sessions and
Stewards of Lectes and Law days in their Leetes, and Law days, shall enquire
of, and hear and determine all and every offense, matter and cause that shall
grow, come or arise by reason of this Statute, and to assesse such reasonable
Fines and amerciaments for the same as by them shall be thought meet, and that
all and every penalty, sum or sums of money forfeited, or to be imposed for
any cause within this Statute, shall be levied within every parish by the
Surveyors of the ways within that parish for the time being, by distress and
sale of distresses in manner and Form as Fines and amerciaments in Leets have
been used, and the money so levied to be employed upon the highway or common
fairing way where the offense was committed within one year, and the said
Surveyors shall at least once every year at the quarter Sessions to be holden
for the said County make a true Account before the Justices of peace there, or
any two of them, whereof one to be of the Quorum, and shall make payment of all
such summ^ of money to the Surveyors to be appointed for the year next
following as he or they shall have collected upon the Estreares thereof to be
made unto them, upon pain to forfeit for every time he shall not so do;
forty shillings sterling. and to be committed until they make payment thereof,
and the Clerk of the Crown, or of the peace, and the Steward of every Leete
shall make estreate indented, of all the Fines, forfeitures and amerciaments
upon the said defaults, and shall deliver the one part thereof to the Surveyors
of every parish where the said offense was committed yearly within Six weeks
after the Feast of Saint Michael the Archangell, and the said Surveyors upon
their account shall have allowed for every pound they shall collect and pay
Eight pence for his own pains and 12. d. English for the Fees of the Clerk
of the Crown, Clerk of the Peace, or Steward of the Leete for the estrates
indented of every several parish that they shall deliver, as is aforesaid.

21. Note that the Kings high way, (or Regia vid) loading either to the Market,
or from town to town, the freehold and soil thereof, and the interest of all
the trees and other such profit^ thereupon growing, do belong to the Lord of
the soil, or Lord of the Manor, 17. Ed. 3. fol. 9. Br. Chimin. 1^. ^1. and
^7. H. 6. fol. 9. Br. Leete^. And therefore such Lords are chargeable to cut
down the Trees and bushes growing in such highways, and yet by the opinion
of Keble, 8. H. 7. fol. 5. the freehold of the highway, and the Trees
thereupon growing are belonging to him that has the land next adjoining, Br.
Nusans 18. but it seems this must be understood of common field ways, or
other private ways, and not of the Kings highway. See ^. Ed. 4. fol. 9. and
Britton. fol. 111.

22. Note also that he which has land adjoining next to the K. highway, by
the common Law (before these statutes) was and is chargeable and bound of
common right, to cleanse and scour the ditches adjoining to the said highway.
8. H. 7. fol. 1. A. Br. Nasanus 28.

23. And it is called the Kings highway, for that the King at all times, has
therein passage for himself and all his people, and may punish all Nufans
therein, though otherwise the interest thereof be in the Lord, to take all the
Trees and such other profits there growing and to bring his Action for digging
therein, or for any other like Trespass there done.

24. F.N.B. 113. A.
And the King (by the common Law) may award his Commission for the amending of
the highways and Bridges throughout his Realm, so as his people may have
safe passage thereby.

Cloth. CHAP. 7.
EVery Justice of peace may examine and punish certain abuses concerning the
making of cloth, as appears by a Branch of a statute made in Anno 4. E. 4.
ca. 1. which branch follows in these words, viz.

1. Therefore it is ordained and established by the authority aforesaid that
every man and woman being cloth-makers Cloth-makers.
from the Feast of Saint Peter, shall pay to the Carders, spinsters, and all
such other laborers of any member thereof, lawful money for all their lawful
wages Wages.
and payment of the same. And also to deliver wolles to be wrought according to
the faithful delivery and due weight upon pain of forfaiture to the same
labourer the treble of his said wages so not paid, as often as the said
cloth-maker does refuse to pay the same in the said manner and form to any
such labourer, put by him to the occupation in any of the said members of
cloth-making. And also to forfeit to the same labourer for every delivery of
excessive and unlawful weight to him delivered to be wrought 6. d. for every
default, and that every Carder, Spinster, Weaver, Fuller, Shereman, and Dyer,
shall duly do his labor in his occupation, upon pain to yield to the party
grieved in this behalf his double damages.

2. And that every Fuller Fuller.
in his Craft and occupation of fulling, rowing, or tazeyling of cloth, shall
exercise tazells and no Cards, deceiptfully empayring the same cloth, upon
pain to yield to the party grieved his double damages.

3. And that every Justice of peace for the time being, of every County of this
Realm throughout the same County, out of Cities, Burroughes, and Towns where
any Mayor, Master, Warden, bailiffe, or bailiffes is or be, and every Mayor,
where there is no master, and every master where there is no Mayor, and every
bailiffe or bailiffes, where there is no Mayor nor master, and every Portreve,
where no Mayor, master, bailiffe nor bailiffes is or be, of every City Burgh
and Town within every such County aforesaid, and every Constable of hundred
where any Constable of hundred is out of every City, Burgh, and Town, where
any Mayor, Master, Bailiffe or Bailiffes, or portrives is or be. And every
Steward keeping or holding Wapentake or Leete of any person, out of City,
Burgh, or Town, where no Mayor, Master, bailiffe, or bailiffes, or portreves
is or be, shall have power and authority by this ordinance to hear and
determine the Complaints of every such cloth-maker and labourer, as well for non
payment of the said laborers wages, as of the said forfaiture and damages by
due examination of the parties in this behalf thereupon, for non payment of
the said duties and forfaiture, and for the said damages to commit the said
offenders in this behalf to the next jail within the same County there to
remain till the said duties, forfaitures and damages be duly paid to the said
labourer or cloth-maker. And also that every of the said Justices of P. Mayor,
Master, Warden, bailiffe, or bailiffes, portreve, and steward or Wapentake and
Leete upon the information or complaint of any other person, which is not
grieved in this behalf, shall have power by the said authority within his
jurisdiction to cause the party to come before him, against whom such
Information or complaint shall be made for offending this ordinance, and to
examine them in and upon the matter contained in the same information or
complaint. And if the party by examination or other due proof be found guilty
or defective, that then the same party, as often and for every time that he is
so found guilty or defective shall forfeite to the King or to such person or
persons which is or be entitled, to have fines, or amerciaments for offenses
done within there Jurisdiction three shillings and four pence. And that every
of the said Justices of peace and other officers aforesaid within their
Jurisdiction upon every of the said Informations or complaints shall have full
power to make like process against the party, upon whom any such Information or
complaint, as before is rehearsed, shall be made to cause him personally to
appear before him, thereupon to be examined as Justices of peace have upon
Information or complaint made to them for surety of the peace without any Fee
or reward to be taken or had by any of the said Justices or any other officer
in this party for the execution of their offices in this behalf.

Constables. CHAP. 8.
1. EVery Justice of peace may cause two Constables to be chosen in each
hundred or barony. And this is to be understood of the high Constables of
hundreds, and it is employed of congruence that he swear them, 13. Ed. 1. ca. 6.
and this seems to be by virtue and force of the statute of Winchester, made
13. Ed. 1. and of the first Assignavimus of the Commission of the peace.

2. 13. Ed. 1. ca. 6.
Note that these Constables of hundreds were first ordained by the said statute
of Winchester, tempore Ed. 1. And they were to make view of armor twice every
year, and to present before Justices assigned, defaults of Armor, of Watches,
of highways, and of Huy and Cry, and also all such as lodged strangers, for
whom they would not answer.

3. See stat. 4. Ed. ^. ca. 3. and 10.
Petie Constables (in Towns and parishes) were after devised for the aid of
the Constables of the hundred, viz. about the beginning of the reign of K. E.
3. as appears by Master Lambert, in his book of the duties of Constables,
page 9.

4. The choosing and swearing of these petty Constables is reputed properly to
belong to the Court Leet: One Justice.
yet we find it usual and warranted by common experience that every Justice
of Peace does also swear them.

5. And here for the better choosing of these Constables, you shall understand
that the law requires that every Constable be Idoneus homo, Co. 8. 41.
that is, apt and fit for the execution of the said office, and he is said in
law to be Idoneus who has these three things, honesty, knowledge, and
ability.

1. Honesty, to execute his office truly without malice, affection or
partiality.

2. Knowledge, to understand what he ought to do.

3. Ability, as well in substance or estate as in body, that so he may intend
and execute his office diligently, and not through impotency of body or want to
neglect the place.

6. And if any shall be chosen Constable which is not thus enabled and
qualified, he may by Law be discharged of his said office, and another fit man
appointed in his place.

7. Also by a statute made in Ireland in the fifth year of the Reign of King
Edward the fourth, it is ordained that in every English Town of this land that
has more then three houses holden by Tenants, where no other president is, be
chosen by his neighbors, or by the Lord of the same Town, one Constable to be
president and governor of the same Town, Co. 8. 42. 5. Ed. 4. ca. 5. in
Ireland.
in all things that pertains to the common rule of the same Town, as is in
ordinance of night watch from Michaelmas to Easter yearly, under pain of
three pence every night, and also to ordain one pair of Buts for shooting
within the Town or well near, upon the Costs and labor of the said Town
under pain of two shillings from one month to other after the publication
hereof till the Constable be made and the Buts also, and that every man of the
same Town, in such hour as the Constable or his Deputy of his neighbors will
assign, that is betwixt threescore and sixteen years of age muster before
the Constable or his deputy at the said Buts and shoot up and down three times
every feast day betwixt the first of March and the last day of July, under
pain of one half penny for every day, and that all these pains belevied of
their goods or wages from month to month by the Constable to be spent in
strengthening of the same Town, or otherwise in his default to be levied by the
Warden of the peace, and that the pains lost be spent upon the Towns where
the said pains rises.

8. Also by a statute made in Ireland in the tenth year of King Henry the
seventh it is ordained, That every subject having goods and Chattels to the
value of Ten pounds, have an English Bow and a sneafe of Arrows according,
every subject having goods to the value of 20. l. have a Jack, Sallet, and
English Bow, and a sheafe of arrows, every Freeholder having land to the value
yearly of four pounds, have his horse, Jack, Sallet, Bow and Sheafe of
Arrows, every Lord, Knight, and Esquire within the said land have for every
yeoman daily in their household, Jack, Salet, Bow, and Arrows, to the intent
that all the Commons of the said land may be able to do the King or his
Lieutenant service for their own defense and surety, And that if the
foresaid persons or any of them do not observe and perform the premises, as
it is before specified, that then they and every of them do forfeit to the
King 6. s. 8. d. as often times as they and every of them shall offend the
foresaid ordinance: And likewise that there be in every Barony within every
Shire of the said land two Wardens of peace having authority, as it has been
used of old time, and in every parish Constables of able persons, inhabitants
within the said parishes, and a pair of Buts to be had within every of the
foresaid parishes, at the cost of the said parishioners, that the Commons of
the said land may the sooner attain the practice and experience of Archers,
And that the foresaid Constables in every parish upon pain of forfeiture of
12. d. at every default, do call before them or one of them every holy day all
and every of the foresaid persons, having Bows and Arrows, as before is
rehearsed, 10. H. 7: ca. 9. in Ireland.
to shoot, and cause them to shoot at the least two or three games at the said
Buts, and if any of the said persons make default at any holy day without a
reasonable cause showed that then the said Constables have full power and
authority to record their defaults and amerce them and every of them at every
such default in 4.d. and the said Constables to present the said amerciaments
in writing to the Barons of the Kings Eschequer in the said land to be levied
and perceived in like manner and form as the Kings Revenues have been levied
there.

Felony. CHAP. 9.
1. EVery Justice of peace by force of the first Assignavimus of the Commission
may cause fresh suite Huy and Cry, and search to be made by the Sheriff,
bailiffes, Constables, and others, upon any Treason, robbery, theft, or other
felony, and also may cause the Constables to arrest and to imprison all such as
shall be suspected of such Treason or felony, or to be Thieves, Murderers, or
Felons.

2. Also every Justice of peace may and must take the examination of all such
felons or persons suspected of treason or felony as shall be brought before
him, 10. Carolica. 18.
and must also take information against them (of those that bring them) sc. of
the fact, and of circumstances thereof, and must put in writing such
examinations and informations, or so much thereof as shall be material to
prove the felony, and must certify them to the next general jail delivery,
and after such examination and information taken, then must commit such
traitors or felons to the jail, if they be not baileable; but if they be
baileable, then there must be two Justices together, the one of them of the
Quorum to bail them, or else they cannot be bailed.

3. The Justice of peace that takes the examinations must by recognisance
bind the Informers that do declare any thing material to prove the felony or
treason, to appear and give evidence against the felon at the next general
jail delivery, to be holden within the County, City, or Town corporate, where
the trial of the said offense shall be.

Stamf. 58. Li. intr. 385. Co. 9. 118.
4. The Justices of peace in the County of Dublin as well by virtue of their
Commission, as also by force of the statutes of 18. E. 3. 2. 34. Ed. 3. 1. and
17. R. 2. 10. have authority to hear and determine all felonies; for the words
of the Commission to that purpose are, Audiendum and terminandum, and ad
delinquentes castigandum and puniendum.

5. Also there be diverse statutes which by special words did ordain that the
Justices of peace should have authority at their general quarter Sessions to
inquire of, hear and determine certain felonies, As the statutes 18. H. 6.
19. and 1. Ed. 4. for felonies presented before Sheriffs in their Turns or
law days.

Cromp. 5^.
6. And yet there be some felonies, which the Justices of peace cannot hear or
try at all, neither can they enquire thereof, nor otherwise deal therewith, as
it seems, as namely.

^. H. 6. ^2. 12. Co. 11. 34.
7. Embeazelling of any record, writ, return, panel, process or warrant of
Attorney in the Chancery, Eschequer, the one bench, or the other, or in the
treasury, whereby any judgment shall be reversed, Every such offense is made
felony in such imbezellor, stealer, or taker away, and in their procurors,
Counselors and abettors by the statute of 8. H. 6. But such offenses are by
the same statute appointed to be tried by a Jury, whereof the one half shall
be of the men of the same Courts, and before the Judges of the said Courts of
the one Bench, or of the other.

2. R. 3. fo. 10.
8. Razing of any such record is also felony within the said statute of 8. H. 6.
and to be tried as aforesaid, Br. Coro. 174.

9. Forging of any deed or writing sealed, or of any Court Roll, will or
acquittance; Or to cause or assent to be made any such forged writing, or to
publish or show forth in Evidence any such forged writing, knowing the same to
be forged. If any person being once lawfully convicted of any of the said
offenses, shall afterward commit any the said offenses again, 2^. El ca. 4.
in Ireland.
every such second offense is made felony by the statute of 5. El. ca. 24. in
England; But by the same statute such offenses are to be inquired of, heard and
determined by and before Justices of Oyer and Terminer, and Justices of Assize,
which statute is enacted in Ireland in Anno 28. El. ca. 4.

10. And therefore whereas one R. Smith was indicted at the S^ssions of the
peace in the County of Oxford upon the said statute of 5. Elizab. for forging
of a false deed, it was adjudged by the whole Court in the K. bench Anno 30.
Co. 9. 118.
Elizab. that the said indictment was not well taken. For although the Justices
of peace by their Commission have power (of Oyer and Terminer) to hear and
determine felonies, and trespasses, etc. And have in their said Commission an
express clause ad audiendum and terminandum, and so are Justices of Oyer and
Terminer, yet it was resolved by the Court, that forasmuch as there is a
Commission of Oyer and Terminer known distinctly by that name, and the
Commission of the peace is known distinctly by another name, that the said
indictment taken before the Justices of the peace at their Sessions was not
well taken, and therefore it was quashed.

11. The reason of this last case and Judgment seems to hold in the former
cases, and in all other like cases where any statute does specially give
authority to any other distinct Court, or to other Justices or Commissioners
(leaving out the Justice of peace) to enquire of, hear and determine, or to
try felons, etc. there the Justices of the peace at their Sessions cannot
enquire thereof, etc.

12. Against servants imbeazelling, or taking away the goods of their deceased
master, the executors of the party deceased may have a writ directed to the
Sheriff to make open proclamation two market days, that such offenders shall
appear in the K. Bench at a certain day, And if such writ be returned and
proclamation is thereupon made accordingly, then if the said persons which
should appear by reason of the said proclamation, do make default, 33. H. 6.
ca. 1.
and do not appear in the K. Bench at the day specifyed in the said writ they
shall be attainted of felony by the statute of 33. Hen. 6. So that such offense
of servants embeazelling their said masters goods, begins first to be felony
upon their default of appearance in the Kings Bench after proclamation; Of which
default the Justices of peace cannot take notice, for that they have not before
them the record of such default or not appearing, and therefore the Iu. of P.
cannot inquire of such felony.

13. But in the former cases, if any such offender shall be brought before any
Just. of peace, and charged with any such felony, quare how far the Justice
of peace is to deal or what he is to do therein, considering the Justices of
peace are no Judges of such felonies, neither have they any Jurisdiction given
them by the statutes in such cases. Nevertheless, I conceive it to be both
serviceable and safe for the Justice of peace not only to examine the offense,
and the circumstances thereof, and then to certify those examinations to such
persons as by the statute are made Judges of the cause, but also to commit such
an offendour to prison, 10. Caroli ca. 1^. in Ireland.
and to bind over the Informers to give Evidence, and this I conceive to be
warranted by the statute of 10. Caroli ca. 18. in Ireland.

14. Again, if a man had been feloniously stricken, poisoned or bewitched in
one County, and after dyed thereof in another County, by the common Law no
Indictment could be thereof taken in either of the said two Counties, for that
the Jurors of the County where such party dyed could not take knowledge of the
said stroke, poisoning or bewitching, (being in a foreign County.) Nor the
Jurors of the County where the stroke, poisoning or bewitching was committed,
could not take knowledge of the death in another County: 10. Caroli. ca. 1^. in
Ireland.
But now by the statute of 10. Caroli ca. 19. an Indictment thereof found by
Jurors of the County where the death shall happen (whether it shall be found
before the Coroner, or before Justices of peace, or other Justices, etc. shall
be good and effectual in Law, and that the Justices of jail delivery, and
Oyer and Terminer in the same County where such indictment shall be taken
shall and may proceed upon the same, as if such stroke, poisoning or
bewitching, and death had been all in one and the same County.

15. Also where Felons had robbed, or stolen goods in one County, and after
conveyed the spoil, or goods so stolen into another County to their adherents
there, 10. Caroli ca. 19 in Ireland.
who knowing of such felony, received the same goods; In which case although
the principal were after attainted, the accessory notwithstanding escaped, by
reason that he was accessory in another County. And that the Jurors of the said
other County by the common law could take no knowledge of the principal felony
in the first County. But now by the said statute it is enacted that where any
murder or felony shall be committed and done in one County, and other persons
shall be accessory, in any manner, to any such murder, or felony, in any other
County, That an Indictment thereof, found or taken against such accessory, Co.
9. 117.
before the Justices of peace, or other Justices, etc. in the County where such
offense of accessarie shall be committed, shall be good and effectual in law,
And that the Justices of Jail delivery, or Oyer and Terminer, of or in such
County, where the offense of any such accessarie shall be committed, shall
write to the Custos Rotulorum, where such principal shall be attainted, or
convict, to certify them whether such principal be attainted, convicted, or
otherwise discharged of such felony, And thereupon the Custos Rotulorum, shall
make certificate in writing under his seal, to the said Justices accordingly,
and then the Justices of Jail delivery or Oyer and Terminer, shall proceed
upon every such accessory in the County where such accessory became Accessory,
as if both the principal offense, and accessory had been committed and done
in the said. County where the offense of accessory was committed.

16. So as by the letter of this last recited statute the jurisdiction over
these last recited felonies, and over such Accessaries is not committed to the
Justices of peace to proceed to the trial of them; But this authority is
committed to the Justices of jail delivery or of Oyer and Terminer, yet the
Justices of peace may examine these offenses, and take information against the
offenders and certify the same to the next general jail delivery and may
bind over the Informers and commit the offenders, Also the Justices of peace
may inquire thereof, and take indictments against them as in other cases of
felony.

17. Lastly the Justices of peace (at their Sessions) cannot make trial of
such as be indicted of Felony, before Coroners or before the Justices of jail
delivery or of Oyer and Terminer, unless the same persons ( scilicet, the said
Coroner, Justices of Jail delivery, Lamb. 530.
or of Oyer and Terminer) were also Justices of peace in the same County, so as
the indictment may be understood to be taken by them as before Justices of the
peace, For the Commission of the peace, and the authority of Justices of the
peace, extends only to try such as stand indicted before themselves or
before former Justices of the P. or before the Sheriff in his Turn of the
Steward in a Leete. See the statute 1. Ed. 4. cap. 2. for indictments taken in
the Sheriffs Turn and for Indictments taken in a Leet. See. Br. tit. Leet. 1.

18. But now to return to the business of the Justices of peace out of their
Sessions. If one shall bring a man suspected of Treason or felony before any
Just. of P. but refuses to be bound to give Evidence against the prisoner
either at the general jail delivery, or quarter Sessions, as the case shall
require, If such bringer has given Evidence before the said Iu. against the
prisoner, or can declare any thing material to prove the felony and will not,
Cromp. 10^. b.
the Justice of peace (upon his discretion) may commit to prison such person so
refusing, or may bind him to his good behavior, But if the bringer of a person
suspected of felony cannot declare any thing material to prove the felony nor
any other person then present, the Justice ought not to commit the prisoner,
yet the Justice of peace shall do well to examine the prisoner, and if he
shall confess the felony then to commit him, Or if upon his examination, there
shall appear any just cause of suspicion, Or if the prisoner be a man of evil
fame, and that there be a felony committed in these cases, the Justice shall
do well not to let him go, but at least to bind him over to the next jail
delivery, and in the mean time to take further information against him. Now
forasmuch as it appears that a great part of the office of a Justice of p^ace
is to be exercised in the apprehending, examining, and committing of felons, it
will be necessary to know first what offenses are felony by the common Law, And
in the next place to set forth what offenses are felony by the statute Laws.

Felonies by the Common Law. CHAP. 10.
1. FElonies by the Common Law are of diverse sorts, as Homicide, Burglarie,
Theft, burning of houses, Rescous and escape.

2. Homicide Homicide.
most properly is, hominis occisio ab homine facta, for if a man be killed by a
beast (as a horse or dog) or by any other thing or mischance, although that
be hominis cedium of which two words Homicide is derived, yet in such cases it
is not aptly nor usually said that homicide is committed, but only a man is
said to be slain.

3. Others do thus defyne or describe it, Homicide is the felonious killing of
one man by another within the Realm and living under the Kings protection.

4. But to kill a man beyond the Seas, or to strike and give one a mortal
wound beyond the Seas, or upon the Sea, whereupon he dies upon the land
(within this Realm) these homicides are not punishable as felony by the common
Law, for that they cannot be inquired of nor tried here, 10. Caroli ca. 19. in
Ireland.
for in criminal causes the rule is ubi quis delinquit ibi punietur. But now
by a statute made in 10. Caroli ca. 19. it is otherwise, and by that statute
these offenses are felony, and shall be tried here.

5. But whether he that is slain, be an Alien, or a Denizen, an Englishman or
stranger, it makes no difference, if he live under the Kings protection.

Co. 7. 13. 14. Cromp. 24.
6. To kill a man attainted (by verdict or by outlawry, or otherwise) of any
murder, felony or Treason, is felony: For none may kill, or put to death any of
these, but the Officer of Justice, and that by warrant. See Doct. and Student.
f. 133.

7. To kill the Kings enemy is no Felony, And by the statute of 25. E. 3. ca.
22. to kill a man attainted upon a praemunire is not felony, but by a statute
made in England in 5. El. ca. 1. it is declared to be Felony to kill one that
is attainted in a Praemunire.

8. Also to kill a man that has abjured the realm, is Felony. See Co. 7. 9.
b. and the Doct. and Student, fol. 133.

9. Note that the Kings protection belongs by the law of nature to all these,
Co. 7. 14.
and the King may protect and pardon them all.

Homicide is threefold Voluntate, and est duplex Murder, Manslaughter or
Chancemedley.
Casu or misadventure, this also is considerable after two sorts: sc. whether
it happen in doing a thing lawful or unlawful.
Necessitate, this is sometimes 1. Commanded, sc. in execution of Justice. 2.
Tolerated, 3. Prohibited, for advancement of Justice. Se defendendo.




Felo de se.
10. But first to write something of Felo de se.

Dyer. 262: Plo. 261.
11. If a man kill himself (either with a premeditate hatred against his own
life, or out of discontent, or other humor) he is called Felo de se, and he
shall forfeit to the King his goods and Chattels real and personal, and his
debts due to him by specialty, Stamf. fo. 188. Co. li. 4. fo. 95.
and also debts due to him without specialtie, or upon simple contract and yet
Dyer 262. 16. Ed. 4. 7. are that debts upon contract shall not be forfeited,
but Stamford, fo. 188. and Co. li. 4. fo. 95. resolve that debts upon contracts
shall be forfaited.

12. But he shall not forfeite his lands: Fi. Coro. 301. Plo. 261.
neither shall his blood be corrupt, See Fitz. Coron. 362. and 426.

13. If a man do give himself a deadly wound, and dies thereof within the
year and a day after, Plo. 262.
All his goods etc. which he had the time of the blow given, or at any time
after, shall be forfeited to the King.

14. Yet the goods of felo de se, Co. ^. 110. 21. H. 7. 33.
be not forfeited till his death be presented and found of record; neither can
these goods be claymed by prescription by Lords of liberties, etc. but by the
Kings grant, because the King is entitled by matter of record.

15. If A. do strike B. to the ground and then draws his knife to kill B.
and B. lying upon the ground, 44. Ed. 3. 44.
draws his knife to defend himself, and A. is so hasty to kill B. that he
falls upon B. his knife, Fitz, Cor. 94.
and so A. is slain, here A. in a manner is Felo de se, And yet shall not A.
forfeite his goods in this case, See 44. Ass. p. 17. Br. Cor. 12. and 14.

16. If one that wants discretion, kills himself (as an Infant, Stamf. 19.
co. 1. 9^. Plo. 269. F. Cor. 342. Co. 4. 125.
or a man non compos mentis) he shall not forfeite his goods, etc.

17. If a lunatique person kills himself he shall forfeite his goods ( sc.
if he kills himself out of his lunacy) otherwise if he kills himself
during his lunacy.

18. The enquiry of such a felony, belongs to the Coroher; And yet if Felo de
se be cast into the Sea, Co. 5. 110.
or so secretly buried that the Coroner cannot have the sight of his body and
so cannot enquire thereof, then the Justices of peace, or any other having
authority to enquire of Felonyes, may enquire thereof (For that it is felony)
and a presentment thereof found before them entituleth the King to his goods.

Murder. CHAP. 11.
1. OF old time every killing of one man by another was called Murder Murder.
(of the effect) because death ensued of it; Afterward murder was restrained to
a secret killing only and therefore Bracton and Britton in their definition of
murder call it, Plo. 261.
Stamf. 18.
Occulta occisio nullo praesente, etc. But since Murder has been and is taken
in a middle degree neither so largely as it first was, Plo. 261.
nor so narrowly as Master Bract. and Britton speak of it, For murder is now
construed to be, when one man upon malice prepensed does kill another
feloniously, viz. with a premeditate and malicious mind whether it be openly
or privily done, 10. ^. 7. ^^. ^1. in Ireland.
this by the common Law is felony of death and now by a statute in Ireland made
in Anno 10. H. 7. it is high Treason.

2. This malice precedent or prepensed may be either apparent (as where there
was a precedent falling out; Or where there is a lying in wait, or a time and
place appointed, etc. Or it may be less apparent or manifest, and yet shall be
employed presumed, and taken to be out of malice precedent by the manner and
circumstances thereof.

Co. 9. 67.
3. As where one kills another without any provocation, the Law implies and
adjudgeth it to have proceeded of malice prepensed, Cromp. 23. 27.
Therefore if one suddenly, and without any show of quarrel, or offense
offered, shall draw his weapon and therewith kill another; Or if one shall be
reading of some book, or otherwise busied, so as he saw not the party that
shall stab or strike him (and he dies thereof) or shall be going over a style,
10. H. 7. c^. 11. in Ireland.
etc. and another shall kill him, such offenders shall suffer death as in case
of wilful murder, But the offense of wilful murder by the said statute made
in Ireland in 10. H. 7. is made high Treason: as is before expressed.

Co. 4. 40. and 9. 66. 68.
4. To kill the Sheriff or any of his officers in the execution of the Kings
process, or in doing their office, is murder in him that kills the officer.

5. But if he be not an officer known, he must show his warrant before he
arrest the party, Co. 9. 69.
or upon the arrest (if the other shall demand to see it) or else it seems
the arrest is tortious; And where the arrest is tortious (be it by an officer
known, or by another) there, the killing of him that makes such an unlawful
arrest is no murder, but manslaughter only.

Co. 9. 65.
6. Again, where an officer has the Kings writ, or other lawful warrant,
though it be erroneous, yet in the executing thereof, if he be slain, this is
murder. For the officer is not to dispute of the validity of his warrant, Co.
9. 68.
or the authority of the Court, or of the Justice of peace that sent the
warrant.

7. To kill any Magistrate, or Minister of Justice in the execution of their
office, or in keeping the peace (according to the duty of their office, Co. 4.
49. and 9. 68.
) is murder, and the law implies it to be of malice prepensed. And therefore
if the Sheriff, Justice of peace, high Constable, petty Constable, watchman,
or any other minister of the Kings, or any that come in their aid be killed in
doing their office, this is murder.

8. If the Sheriff, or Justice of peace come to suppress Riotters, and one of
the Sheriff or Justices company is slain by one of the Riotters, 22. Eli^.
Cromp. ^3.
this is murder in all the Riotters that be there present.

Co. 4. 40.
9. A Constable with others to aid him, do come to part an Affray, if the
Constable or any of his company shall be slain in doing this his office, it is
murder in him that killed him, although the Affray were on the sudden, and
though it were in the night, for when the Constable commands them in the Kings
name to keep the peace, although they cannot know him to be a Constable, Co.
9. 66.
yet at their peril they ought to obey him upon such commandment.

10. And in these cases, the killing of such officers or of any of their
company, is in law intended to be of malice prepensed, sc. that the murderer
had a malicious resolution in him to oppose himself against the Law, the
officers thereof, and the Justice of the Realm.

11. Also if a Thief that offreth to rob a true man, Plo. 474.
kills the true man in resisting him, it is murder, of malice prepensed. Plo.
474. Co. 9. 67.

12. A man carried his Father (being sick) and against his will (in a frosty
and cold time) from one Town to another, 2. Ed. 3. 18.
and the Father died thereof, this was adjudged murder in the Son.

13. A harlot delivered of a Child, hid it in an Orchard, 2. Eliz. Cromp. 24.
it being alive, and covered it with leaves, and a Kite stroke at it, and the
child died thereof, and the mother was arraigned and executed for Murder.

14. And in these two last cases, Voluntas reputabitur profacto, death ensuing
thereupon, for it may plainly appear that they had a will and meaning of that
harm which followed, which will in them does amount to malice, and so makes
their offenses to be murder: And in such cases where death ensues, Nihil
interest utrum quis occidat, an causam mortis praebeat.

15. A man dies in the hand of a Physician or Surgeon, F. Cor. 163.
this is no felony in the Physician or Surgeon. But if one which is no
Physician, or Surgeon will take a Cure upon him, 43. Ed. 3. 32.
and his patient dies under his hand, this has been holden to be felony; but
I cannot conceive it to be felony, for it cannot be discerned whether the
patients death comes by any wilful default in the party, or by the patients
infirmity, again there appears in them no will to do harm, but rather to
do good; and therefore it would be a hard construction to make it Felony. But
if a Smith or other person (having skill only in dressing or curing the
diseases of horses or other Cattle) shall take upon him the cutting, or
letting blood, or such like cure of a man, who dies thereof, this seems to
be felony, for the rule is, Quod quisque norit in hoc se exerceat.

16. Two playing at Tables fall out in their game, Cromp. 23.
and the one kills the other with a dagger suddenly, this was holden murder
in one Emeryes case, before Bromeley at the Assizes in Cheshire about 27. El.
as Master Crompton reports.

17. The husband upon words between him and his wife, suddenly stroke his wife
with a Pestell, whereon she dyed, Cromp. 25.
and it was adjudged murder at the Assizes at Stafford before W^mesly. 43. Eliz.

18. A. has wounded B. in fight, and after they meet suddenly and ^^^t
again, and B. kills A. this seems murder, and malice (...) intended in B.
upon the former hurt, but now if A. had killed (...) seems but Manslaughter
in A. for his former malice shall be thought to be appeased by the hurt he
first did to B. unless A. gave the first assault, but if A. made the first
assault without any new provocation that shall be intended to be in pursuit of
the former malice, and then it shall be adjudged murder, so if two are in suite
and they meet suddenly and quarrel about the suite, and the defendant kills
the plaintiff, this seems to be but Manslaughter and not murder.

19. Also wilful killing of another, by poison was and is murder, by the
common Law, See Stamf. 21. and Br. Indictment. 41.

Plo. 474.
20. The husband gave a poisoned Apple to his wife to the intent to kill her,
and she not knowing of it gave it to her child, who dyed thereof, this is
murder in the husband, and yet he loved that child dearly: and so had it
been if a stranger of his own accord had after eaten thereof and dyed
thereof, for the putting of poison into the apple etc. upon an evil and
felonious intent, Co. 9. 81.
makes it murder, whosoever be killed thereby.

21. A. brings drink that was poisoned (knowing of it) to B. who advised B.
to drink of it, Co. 4. 16.
telling him it would do him much good, by reason of which persuasion, B.
drunk of it (in the absence of A.) and dyed thereof, this was adjudged murder
in A.

Cromp. 30.
22. If one gives corrupt victual to another to the intent to poison him, and
he dies thereof within the year and day, this is murder. Co. ^. 81.
But if a man shall prepare Rats bane, etc. to kill Rats and shall lay this in
certain places to that purpose, without any evil intent, and another man
finds and ears this, and dies thereof, yet this is no felony; for by the
common Law there cannot be a felony without a felonious intent.

23. The master upon malice precedent, goes to kill another and takes his
fervants with him (but they know nothing of their masters intent) and the
master and his servants do meet the other, Plo. 100
and do assault and kill him, this is murder in the master, and but
manslaughter in the fervants.

24. Note that when a man has malice to one, and intending and endeavoring to
kill him, Plo. 47 4.
he kills another man, this is murder whomsoever he kills, vide Plo. 101.
Dyer 128. Fitz. Coron. 262. Stamf. 16. for his intent was to do murder.

F. Cor. 262. Dyer. 128.
25. If two fight upon malice prepensed, and in their fight a stranger (that
would part them) is killed, this is murder in them both, if it may not be
proved which of them did kill him.

Plo. 474.
26. A man upon malice shoots at one, or lies in wait to kill one, and
kills another unwittingly, in both these cases it is murder.

27. Note also that in all cases where a man comes or goes about to do any
thing unlawfully, as to kill, beat or disseise another, or to do any other
Trespass, and in doing this, he kills any man, this is murder, See Cromp.
24. B.

Cromp. 24.
28. One stealing Pears in another man's Orchard, and the owner came and rebuked
him, and the other killed him, this was adjudged murder. 4. Maria.

29. Also where a man commands another to beat A. and he beats him, so as
A. dies thereof, Plo. 475. F. Coro. 314.
this is murder in him that gave this commandment to beat him, for that he
commanded him to do an unlawful Act, by reason whereof, the killing of a man
ensued.

30. Br Cor. 272. F. Coro. 350. Co. 11. 5.
Note also that if diverse persons come in one company to do any unlawful
thing, as to kill, rob, or beat a man, or to commit any Riot, or Affray, or
to do any other Trespass, and one of them in doing thereof kills a man,
this shall be adjudged murder in them all that are present of that party,
although they did but look on, etc. See Stamf. 40. Fitz. Indictment 22. Nay if
they be not present, yet if they be in the same house, or upon the same ground,
it is murder in them all. See the Lord Dacres case. Crom. 25.

31. Note also that all that are present, aiding, abbetting, Plow. 100.
or comforting to another to do murder, are principal murderers, although
they shall give never a stroke, See, morc 4. H. 7. 18. 13. H. 7. 10. Fitz.
Coron. 309. Co. 9. 67. 112. and 115.

32. As if A. and B. fall out and appoint the field, and they meet accordingly
each of them bringing company with them, A. kills B. this is murder in all
those that came with A.

33. Note also that in case of murder, it is not material who gives the first
blow; for if he that is slain gave the first blow, yet if there were malice
prepensed in the other, it is murder in him that kills him.

34. Also in case of poisoning, Coron. 303.
the party poisoned must dye thereof within a year and a day after the poison
received, or else it is not felony, Also if a man do beat or hurt another,
whereof he dies, to make it murder or other homicide, the party hurt must dye
within a year and a day next after the hurt done or stroke given. Co. 4. 4^.
But to have an appeal it shall have relation to the death and not to the
stroke, so as the appeal must be brought within the year after the death and
not after the stroke.

35. F Coro 26^8 Stamf ^^ c. See Exo. 21.22.23. ^t was death by the Law of God.
Br Coron. 68. 91.
Note also in murder or other homicide the party killed must be in esse (sc. in
rerum natura) For if a man hurts a woman with child whereby he kills the
Infant in his mothers womb by our Law, this is no felony, neither shall he
forfeit any thing for such offense, and whether upon a blow or hurt given to a
woman with child, the child dye within her body or shortly after her delivery,
it makes no difference, yet Master Bracton took it to be homicide, if the
blow were given postquam puerperium animatum fuerit. But if the mother of the
child dye within a year and a day after such hurt done to her, and upon that
hurt, this is felony.

36. In cases of murder or poisoning, 28 El. ca. 8. in Ireland.
the offenders shall not have the benefit of Clergy, for that these offenses
are Treason in Ireland, and likewise for witchcraft the offender shall not have
Clergy.

37. Note also that by the Law of God no recompense was to be taken for the
life of a murderer. Numb. 35.31.

38. And by diverse old statutes, no Charter of pardon ought to be granted to
any person in case of murder, 13. R. 2. c. 2. P. Pardon. 3. Plo. 501.
or other homicide, save only where a man kills another in his own defense
or by misfortune, See P. pardon. 1. See all the statutes of 6. Ed. 1. c. 9. 2.
E. 3. ca. 2. 4. E. 3. See the 2. stat. 13. R. 2. 1.
c. 13. and 14. E. 3. c. 15. And by our Law at this day a pardon of all
felonies will not discharge murder, except the pardon be with a Non obstante or
that murder be expressly mentioned in the pardon. Neither will a pardon of all
felonies discharge a man that is attainted of felony, except also the attainder
and the execution be pardoned. See 9. Ed. 4. 29. Co. 6. 13. b.

39. Note that he which has a pardon for felony, if he has not found sureties
for the good behavior, or if afterward during his life, he shall break the
peace, such pardon shall be holden for none, but that he may be hanged,
notwithstanding his pardon, for by the pardon, 3. H. 7. f. 7.
the offense, tegitur non tollitur, See the statute 10. Ed. 3. ca. 3. P.
Pardon. 5. and 3. H. 7. 7. where one was executed upon this statute, for making
an Affray after his pardon. Br. Coron. 134.

27. H 8. 25. P. ^rer. 17.
40. None have authority to pardon any Treason, murder, or other felony, or
accessory to the same save only the King, it being one of his royal
prerogatives.

Manslaughter. CHAP. 12.
1. MAnslaughter, in the right signification thereof, implies all manner of
homicide and is the general, as well to murder as to the rest, Nevertheless
for that in common speech it is restrained to Manslaughter by Chancemedley
alone, in that sense I will here write of it.

2. Manslaughter, otherwise called Chancemedley, is when two do fight together
upon the sudden, and by mere chance without any malice precedent, and one of
them does kill the other, this also is felony of death. And yet in case of
manslaughter the offendour shall have the benefit of Clergy, and by the Law of
God there was a City of refuge appointed for such to fly unto. Exodus 21.13.
Deuteronomy. 19.3.4.

3. Two fall out upon the sudden and fight, and the one breaks his weapon,
Cromp. 26.
and a stranger standing by (yet being none of their company) lends him a
weapon, and therewith he kills the other, this is Manslaughter as well in him
that killed the other as in the stranger who lent him his weapon.

4. A. and B. fall out upon the sudden, and fight, and A. is so fierce that he
runs upon the others weapon and is slain, Stamf. 16. a.
yet this seems manslaughter in B. unless he were flying from A. for he
should have fled to some wall or strait, or at least, so far as he might
without danger of his life, but if B. had fled to a wall, or so far as he
might, and A. pursues him, and B. perceiving that he would assault him,
holds his weapon between them, and A. runs upon the weapon and is slain,
this is homicide in his own defense, and for which B. shall forfeit only his
goods.

5. Two combat together upon the sudden, and part, and presently after meet
and fight again, and the one kills the other, or the one presently fetches
a weapon, and comes and kills the other, these seem but manslaughter, for
that it is done all in one continuing fury, which was at the first without
malice, and could not in so short a time be appeased, or assuaged, Cromp. 23.
b. 24. A. 26. A.B.

6. So if two have borne malice the one to the other and be reconciled, and
after meeting again, they fall out upon new occasion and by agreement
immediately they go into the field and fight, and the one kills the other,
this is but manslaughter (causa qua supra) unless the respite or distance of
time or place had been such that by reasonable conjecture their heat might be
assuaged.

What persons may be charged with homicide, and what not. CHAP. 13.
1. IF one that is Non compos mentis, or an Idiot, kill a man, Non compos
mentis.
this is no felony; for they have no knowledge of good and evil, nor can have
a felonious intent, nor a will or mind to do harm, Fitz. N. Br. 202.
And no felony or murder can be committed without a felonious intent and
purpose. For it is called felonia, quia fieri debet felleo animo. Co. 4. 21. H.
7. 33. Plow. 19. Co. 4. 1. 4.
124. b.

2. So it is if a Lunatique person kills another during his lunacy ( Coke 4.
125.) for all Acts done by him in lunacye are as the Acts of an Idiot.

3. Now there be three forts of persons accounted, Non compos mentis, to this
purpose, and the like.

1. A fool natural, who is so, (a nativitate) from his birth, Co. 4. 124.
and in such a one there is no hope of recovery.

2. He who was once of sound and good memory, and after (by sickness, hurt, or
other accident, or visitation of God) loses his memory.

3. A lunatique, qui gaudet lucidis intervallis, and sometimes is of good
understanding and memory, and sometimes is Non compos mentis.

4. An Infant of eight years of age, or above, Infants.
may commit homicide, and shall be hanged for it, viz. If it may appear (by
hiding of the person slain, by excusing it, or by any other Act) that he had
knowledge of good and evil, and of the peril and danger of that offense.
Plow. 19.
See 3. H. 7. 1. and 12. Stamf. 27. Fitz Coron. 118. 126. and Br. Coron. 133.
136. But an Infant of such tender years, as that he has no discretion or
intelligence, if he kill a man, this is no felony in him. 3. H. 7. i. b.

26. Ass. p. 27. Br. Coron. 101.
5. If one that is only dumb kills a man, it is felony, yet he cannot be
arraigned, but shall continue still in prison.

F. Coro. 193. Stamf. 16.
6. A man borne deaf and dumb kills another, that is no felony, for he
cannot know whether he did evil or no, neither can he have a felonious intent.

7. Note in these former cases of homicide committed by persons being Non
compos mentis, Plo. 19. Co. 4. 125.
or wanting discretion such things happen, by an involuntarie ignorance, and
therefore the law accounts such Act of theirs to be no felony, But if a man
that is drunk, kills another, that is felony, for it is a voluntary
ignorance in him, in as much as such ignorance comes to him by his own Act
and folly.

Homicide by misadventure. CHAP. 14.
1. HOmicide by misadventure Misadventure.
or misfortune, is when any person doing any lawful thing, without any evil
intent happens to kill a man, by the law of God there was a City of refuge
appointed for such persons to fly unto, Numb. 35.15. and 22. Josh. 20.3. And
by our law now, this is no felony of death, for he shall have his pardon of
course for his life and lands, but yet he shall forfeit his goods, in regard
that a subject is killed by his means. See Stamf. 16. a. b. Fitz. Coron. 69.
302. 354. As if a Schoolmasters, in reasonable manner beating his scholar for
correction only, See Exodus 11. 20. 21.
or a man correcting his child, or servant in reasonable manner, and the
scholar, Stamf. 12. c.
child or servant happen to dye thereof, this is homicide by misadventure.

^1. H. 7. 29. 6. E. 4. 7.
2. So if a man shooting at Buts, pricks, or other lawful mark, and by the
shaking of his hand or otherwise against his will he kills one that stands
by. Or if a Carpenter, Mason or other person does throw or let fall a stone,
Br. Coron. 59.
Tile or piece of Timber from an house, or wood, or other thing from a Cart,
etc. (and gives warning thereof) and another is killed thereby against his
will. Or if a labourer that is falling or cropping of a Tree, 6. Ed. 4. 7. F.
Coron. 398. Plow. 19.
and the same or part thereof falls and kills a man. Or if the head of his
hatchet or other tool falls from him and happens to kill one standing by. Or
if a man be (in due and convenient time) doing any other lawful thing, that
may breed danger to such as pass by and shall give warning thereof, so that
such as pass by may hear and fly the peril, and yet another passing that
way shall be killed therewith. 11. H. 7. 23. See Br. Coron. 2: 9. contra.
Or if men shall run at Tilt, Just or fight at Barriers together by the Kings
commandment, and one of them does kill another, In these former cases and the
like it is, homicide by misadventure, and no felony of death.

3. And yet in cases of misadventure, as also where one kills another, Se
defendendo by the common Law, 21. E. 3. 17. Br. Coro. 40.
these offenses were felony of death and the offendour should have dyed for the
same. But now by statute such offenders are to have pardon for their life and
lands, yet their goods remain forfeit as before (at the common Law) See the
stat. 6. E. 1. c. 9. and 2. E. 3. c. 2.

4. Also in these cases of misadventure, Fitzh. 246. c. and 2. 8. ^. Br. Cor.
1. ce f^at. 6. E 9. 4. H. 7. f. 2. a. Regi. fo. 209.
and in the former cases of homicide committed by Infants, and other persons
being Non compos mentis, And also where one kills another in defense of his
person the ancient course was that they shall be discharged in this manner, sc.
if they desire to purchase their pardon, they must upon their trial plead not
guilty (and shall give in Evidence the special matter) and then this special
matter being found by verdict they shall be bailed, and then they must sue
forth a Certiorari to have this record certified to the Lord Chancellor who
thereupon shall make them a Charter of pardon of course under the great seal,
without speaking or sueing to the King for it, See Stamf. 15. t. But now the
usual course is that without any Certiorari the Justices of jail delivery
make a Certificate to the Lord Chancellor and thereupon the pardon is granted
of course and in the case of Infants and Non compos mentis the Judges receive a
verdict of not guilty, in which case there needs no pardon neither is there
any forfeiture of goods.

5. But if a man be doing of an unlawful Act, Unlawful Act.
though without any evil intent, and he happens by chance to kill a man this
is felony viz. Manslaughter at the least, Stamf 6 c.
if not murder in regard the thing he was doing was unlawful. As shooting of
Arrows, Stamf. 12. c.
or casting of stones into the highway, or other place whither men do usually
resort, So of fighting at Barriers, or running at Tilt or Iusts without the
Kings commandment, whereby a man is slain, And although it were by the Kings
commandment yet it was holden felony by the Justices Tempore. H. 8. Br. Cor.
229.


6. Playing at hand-sword, Bucklers, football, 11 H. 7. 2^. Crom. 26. b. and
29. A.
wrestling and the like, where by one of them receives a hurt and dies
thereof within the year and day, in these cases some are of opinion, that this
is felony of death, some others are of opinion that this is no felony of death,
but that they shall have their pardon of course, as for misadventure, for that
such their play was by consent, and again there was neither former nor present
intent to do hurt, nor any former malice but done only for disport and trial
of manhood and this seems to be the better opinion.

7. A man casts a stone at a Bird, or beast, Fitz Coron. 30^ and 3^4.
and another man passing by is slain therewith, this is but manslaughter by
misadventure; And the opinion of Fineux chief Justice in 11. H. 7. fol. 23. is
that if a man cast a stone over a house and kills a man, See Numb. 35. 23.
Br. Cor. 229.
this is no felony of death but misadventure, but this is to be understood
where there was no intention of hurt to any by casting thereof, likewise some
hold that to cast a stone for pleasure, and not in lawful labor, whereby one
is slain, Stamf. 12. c. 16. c.
is felony of death, and so was the opinion of Master Bracton and Master
Stamford, but I cannot conceive it to be any other then by misadventure when it
is not done felleo animo.

Casual death.
8. Also a man may be slain by other casualty than by the hands or means of
another man, as by the fall of a house, or tree, etc. upon him, or be killed by
a Bull, Bear, or other beast, etc. or be killed by some fall which he himself
takes; And in these and the like cases observe these rules.

1. First, if a man be slain in any such manner, yet if it be by the means or
procurement, or wilful default of another man, this shall be felony in the
party procuring or causing it.

2. The thing which is the cause of such casual death shall be forfeit to the
King as a Deodand, and distributed in Alms by the Kings Almoner, but the
Almoner has no interest as it seems in such goods, but has only the
disposition of the Kings Alms, durante been placito, so that the King may
grant them to any other, See Co. 1. 50. Dyer. 77.

Flo. 260.
3. The forfeiture shall have relation from the stroke given, so as the party or
owner selling thereof ( sc. of such things as was cause of such death) after
the stroke given, takes not away the Kings right, but that he shall have it as
forfeited notwithstanding such sale.

Co. 5. 110.
4. Deodands are not forfeited, until the matter be found of record, and
therefore they cannot be claymed by prescription.

Co. 5. 120. F. Cor. 298. Stamf. 21.
5. The Jury which find the death of the man must also find and appreise the
Deodand, and the same shall be levied of the Town where it happens, although
it were not committed to the Town to keep, and therefore it behooves the
Town to see it forth coming. See the statute de officio Coronatoris 4. Ed. 1.

F. Cor. 289. Stamf. 21.
6. If he that is so slain be under 14. years of age nothing shall be forfeit
to the King as Deodand for him by some opinions, but I cannot conceive those
opinions to be Law.

7. And if a man that is unknown be found dead in the field, his apparel and
money about him shall be given to the poor, P. indictment 27. Stamf. 21.
etc. And if he were known, then his goods shall be delivered to his executors
or administrators, or to the ordinary but shall not be taken as a Deodand, in
either case (for they are not of the nature of a Deodand they being no cause of
his death.

Dyer. 77. Co. 5. 110.
8. Next what shall be forfeited and taken for a Deodand. The old rule is, Omnia
quae movent ad mortem, sunt Deodanda; And yet Deodands may be of some things
that a man shall move or fall from, though the thing it self moves not,
Deodand quid.
as to fall from a ship, Cart, Mow of Corn, or Hay, etc. So as Deodands are
any goods which do cause or are occasion of the death of a man by
misadventure. See Fitz. Coron. 314. 326. 341. 342. 348. 388. 389. 398. 401. 409.

9. If a man kills another with my sword (or other weapon of mine) my weapon
shall be forfeited as a Deodand. Doct. and Student, fo. 156. B.

10. The inquiry of such casual death belongs also to the Coroner, but if
the Coroner cannot have the sight of the body and so cannot inquire thereof, it
seems the King shall be entitled to the goods by a presentment at the
quarter Sessions, or at the general Assizes, or in the Kings Bench, or else
the King may be defrauded.

Homicide upon necessity. CHAP. 15.
1. Commanded.
SOmetimes the Justice of Law commands a man to be put to death, As when the
Judge has pronounced sentence of death against an offendour (attainted by due
course of Law) there (in execution of Justice) an officer, or other person
thereto lawfully deputed may orderly execute such judgment or sentence
according to his warrant, and such sentence or judgment pronounced by the
Judge, and after lawfully executed by the officer, leaves the name and nature
of murder, or homicide, and is called justice or rather judgment, which is the
lawful execution of Justice. Stamf See Do^ Stu^ent fo. 133
But if the officer or other person shall proceed therein upon his own
authority without warrant, or ordine juris non observato, as where an offendour
has judgment given upon him to be hanged, if the Sheriff, or other officer,
etc. shall be head him or by other means put him to death, it is felony in
such officer, etc.

2. Also if a stranger, Stamf. 13.
being not thereto lawfully deputed shall (upon his own authority) put to
death an offender that is condemned to dye, this is felony; Nay if the Judge
himself who gave the judgment of death upon an offender shall after put the
same offender to death, it is not justifiable by him.

3. Tolerated
Sometimes also the Justice of Law tollerateth and suffers a man to be slain
sc. for the necessary execution and advancement of justice, which otherwise
should be left undone. And in such case the Law of the land imputes it not as
any fault to him that shall so kill a man, but freely discharges him thereof
without the K. pardon.

As a Sheriff, Bailiffe, F Cor. 261. Stamf. 13.
or any other person who has a lawful warrant to arreast a man indicted of
felony or Treason may well justify the killing of him, if he will not suffer
himself to be arrested, and yield himself, and that they cannot otherwise
take him. F. Cor. 261. Stamf. 13.
And so every person whatsoever without any warrant may apprehend a felon or a
Traitor upon huy and cry or otherwise, and if he will not yield to be arrested,
but shall resist or fly, the pursuer may kill him without blame.

4. Herewith also agrees the Doctor and Student, lib. 2. cap. 41. saying. If
any person that is no Officer, would arrest a man that is outlawed, abjured or
attainted of Murder, or of any other felony, and such offend or shall disobey
the arrest and by reason of that disobedience he is slain, the other shall not
be impeached for his death, For it is lawful unto every man to arrest and take
such persons, and to bring them forth that they may be ordered according to the
Law.

5. An offender in felony or Treason is led toward the Jail and breaks away
from those that conduct him and makes resistance or flies, his conductors may
justify to kill him, F. Cor. 288. and 328.
if they cannot otherwise take him again.

22. Ass. 55.
6. A prisoner in the jail attempteth to escape, and having broken his Irons,
strikes the Jailer (coming in the night to see his prisoners) and the Jailer
slays such a prisoner, this is no felony.

7. Riotters and such as shall make any forceible Entry or deteyner, Cromp.
23. 30. and 158.
against the statutes, if they shall resist the Justices of peace, or other the
Kings officers, or shall not yield themselves, but shall stand at their
defense, when the Justice of peace or other Officer shall come to arrest or
remove them, if any of them happen to be slain, this is no felony in the
Justice of peace, or officer, or in any of their company that kills such
Riotters, etc.

Cromp. 24. 30.
8. The Sheriff, or his Bailiffe, or other officer comes (by virtue of the
Kings process) to arrest another for debt, or trespass who makes resistance,
Doct. and Student. 133.
and thereupon is slain by such officer, or any of his company, this has been
taken to be no felony.

Stamf. 13. c. f. g.
9. But in all these former cases, there must be an inevitable necessity, sc.
that the offender could not be taken, etc. without killing of him.

7. H. 6. 21.
10. Also in an Appeal of felony, if the Appellant and Appellee do join to
try it by battle, and therein the one does kill the other, as the law does
allow such trial, so does it allow the Event to be justifiable as depending
upon the judgment of God, who gives victory according to truth.

Se defendendo tolerated.
11. Also when one man kills another in the necessary defense of himself, or
his, thereby to deliver himself, his possessions, or his goods, or some other
persons, which he is bound to defend from peril, and which cannot otherwise
escape, this is homicide tolerated upon necessity.

12. As to kill an offender, which shall attempt feloniously to murder or rob
me in my dwelling house, 24. H. 8. 50 P. Forf. 1. Coro. 103. and 305.
or in or near any high way, horse-way, or foot-way, or that shall attempt
Burglariously to break my dwelling house in the night, this is justifiable by
my self, or by any of my servants or company. Co. 5. 91. and 11. 82. Exodus
22.2.
And this being so found by verdict upon trial, we shall be all discharged
without loss of life, lands, or goods, or pardon; For to kill a Thief or
murderer in the defense of my person, my house or goods, is no felony, 26. Ass
32. F. Coron. 261. 305. and 330.
but justifiable by the common Law, Stamf. f. 14. See Co. 5. 91. and 11. 82.
Br. Coron. 100. 102.

13. And if one or more come to burn my house, I or any of my servants, may
justify to shoot forth of my house at them, and to kill them, for such intent
of theirs is felonious. Prohibited.
But if a man shall forceibly get, and keep possession of a house, they within
cannot justify to shoot and kill him that was so put out, or any of his
Company, for that they in the house were there unlawfully. See Cromp. 26. B.

14. If one comes (in the day time or in the night) to enter into my house,
pretending title thereto, and to put me out of my possession, and I kill him,
this seems to be manslaughter in me.

15. If one comes in the day time to my house to beat me, F. Coro. 305.
and does make an assault upon me in my house and fights with me, and I kill
him in defense of my person, Co. 5. 91.
yet in this case I shall forfeite my goods and must have the K. pardon of
course, except it be found that the assaylant came with a felonious intent to
kill or rob me.

16. Note if one kill a true man, in defense of his person there ought to be so
great a necessity, Stamf. 15. 2.
that it must be esteemed to be inevitable, or otherwise it will not excuse,
and therefore he that shall be assaulted by a true man, must first fly as far
as he can, Co. 5. 91. 4. H. 7. 2.
and till he be let by some wall, hedge, ditch, press of people, or other
impediment so as he can fly no further without danger of his life, or of being
wounded, or maimed: and yet in such case if he kill the other, he shall be
committed till the time of his trial, and must then get his pardon for his
life and lands (which pardon notwithstanding he shall have of course) yet he
shall loose and forfeite his goods, and Chattels; for the great regard which
the Law has of a man's life. Co. 5. 91. b.

17. 6. E. 1. c. ^. P. Pardon 1.
A. makes an Affray upon B. and strikes B. and B. flies so far as he can
for saving his life, before any stroke given by B. and A. continues his
assault, whereupon B. does also strike A. and kills him, this is homicide in
his own defense: otherwise it seems to some if B. had stricken the first
blow, or had stricken before he had fled: and yet by other good opinions, the
first stroke or who began the Affray is not material, but the whole matter
will consist upon the inevitable necessity, sc. whether the said B. who killed
A. could not have escaped with his life, Stamf. 15.
etc. without killing A. for otherwise it will not excuse B. for cuncta prius
tentanda. And as it is a charitable, so it is a safe principle (in these cases)
not to try an extremity, till thou have tried all other means. And by Stamf.
fo. 15. It is holden in the former case, F. Coro. 184. and 286. 287. Stamf. 15.
if B. (before he had fled) had stricken A. and given him diverse wounds, that
yet if he fly to a straight before he give A. the mortal wound, and then he
gives his deaths wound, this is homicide in his own defense.

18. But in the former case if B. upon malice prepensed had first stricken A.
and then B. flies to a strait or wall, F. Coro. ^ 87. Cromp. 22. 28. b.
and A. pursues him, and strikes him, and B. kills A. thereupon, this is
murder in B. for the malice prepensed was the ground and beginner hereof, yet
if there had been former malice between A. and B. and they meet suddenly and
A. assaulteth B. and B. before any stroke by him given flies so far as he
can, and A. pursues him, and then B. kills A. this seems to be homicide in
his own defense, notwithstanding the former malice.

19. Copstones case, There was malice between Copstone and one S. and they had
fought diverse times, 15. El. Cromp. 27.
and after met suddenly in London, and C. told S. that he would fight with him,
and S. answered that he had nothing to say unto him, and S. went to the wall
and after C. assaulted S. and then S. stroke and killed C. and it was found
that C. began the Affray, and S. was thereupon discharged without forfeiting
any thing. But that was by force of the statute. 24. H. 8. cap. 5. which is not
in force in Ireland, and therefore as the Law is in Ireland Copstone should
have forfeited his goods and have had his pardon of course.

20. Also if a Theife assaults me to rob, or kill me, I am not bound to fly
to a wall, Stamf. 14.
etc. as I must in case a true man assaults me, and so if an officer of
Justice, or Minister of the Law, in the execution of his office, Co. 9. 98.
be assaulted, he is not bound to fly to a wall, etc. as other subjects are.

21. Also the servant may justify the killing of another in defense of his
masters person, ^1. H. 7. 19.
or house, if the hurt cannot be otherwise avoided. Br. Coron. 63. Also the
servant may justify the killing of him who robbed and killed his Master, so
that it be done presently, and by a statute in Ireland, made in Anno 28. H. 6.
ca. 3. It is lawful to kill Thieves found robbing.

22. In the defense of the possession of my goods I may justify to beat him
that shall wrongfully take them from me, but I cannot justify to kill him,
except he be a Theife.

23. So then to kill a true man in defense of my person, in case where there is
an inevitable necessity ( sc. that I first shall fly so far as I can for
saving my life, etc.) this is no felony of death, etc. But otherwise it is to
kill a true man in defense of my house, lands, or goods, that is manslaughter
(at least.)

21. Ed. 1. P. Forests 4. Stamf. 13. 14.
24. If any Forrester, parke-keeper, or warreiner, or any in their company,
shall kill an offender in their Forest, park, or warren, which (after Huy,
and Cry, levied to keep the peace and to obey the Law) will not yield
themselves, but will fly, or defend themselves by violence, this is no felony,
if there were no former malice in such keeper. Cromp. 30.
But if any such keeper by reason of any former malice, will lay to a man's
charge, that he came to do hurt, whereas he did not, neither was found
wandering nor offending, and so kill him, this is murder in such keeper.

Burglarie. CHAP. 16.
1. BUrglarie is when one or more in the night time do break a dwelling
house, or a Church, or the walls or gates of a City, 22. E. 3. Dalton 231.
or walled Town, with an intent to do felony, although he or they carry away
nothing, yet it is felony of death.

2. First for the time, Br. Cor. 125. Stamf. 30. Co. 11. 36.
Burglary cannot be committed in the day time, but only in the night, for all
indictments of Burglary be Quod noctantur fregit. And the night to this
purpose, begins at the Sun setting, and continues to the Sun rising; And
therefore to break a house, etc. after the Sun setting, and before it be
dark, or after day light in Summer, and before the Sun rises, is Burglarie.

3. Next, Stamf. 30. Dyer. 99. Br. Cor. 106.
for the manner it is holden (by some good opinions) that if a man break the
house to do felony, and yet enters not, it is no Burglary, and that the
indictment must be fregit and intravit, And yet by the opinion of Shard. 27.
Ass. 38. and by the opinions of Sir Anthony Brown, Sir Edward Montague, and
Sir Robert Brook late chief Justice of the common pleas, Cromp. 31. 32. 33.
and others (as Master Crompton reports) if a man do but attempt or
enterprise to break or enter into a dwelling house by night, to the intent to
rob, or kill any person there, though he make no actual entry there, yet it is
a full and complete Burglary, for if he do but put in his hand or foot, it is
an entry in Law, although his whole body were not in; Also to put back the
leaf of a window with his dagger, to draw the latch of the door, to turn but
the key being on the Inner side of the door, or to break the glass window
and to draw out any goods there with a hook, etc. or to break a hole in the
wall, Dalton page 231. and 232.
and to shoot in thereby at any in the house, in all these cases it is
Burglary.

4. So likewise (the door being opened by some of the house) if any the
attempters shall discharge a dag against any in the house, and in discharging
his dag shall hold his hand over the threshold though he set no foot over, this
is Burglary: So if upon attempt of Burglary, they within the house shall cast
out their money for fear, Dalton ib.
and the attempters take it away, in all these cases it is Burglary, and yet
there is no actual entry made, in any of these cases.

5. But if a Thief sets but his foot over the threshold or into any part of
the house to commit felony, this much more shall convict him of Burglary.

6. Cromp. 32.
Also one being let down the Chimney in the night to commit felony, Dalton ib.
it was adjudged burglary by Sir Roger Manwood chief Baron, and yet he broke
not the house.

7. So is it to come into a house by the help of a key, or suddenly to come
into the house by night, the doors being open, and the owner flies to his
chamber, and the offender is taken shoving at the chamber door.

8. So it is likewise if Thieves pretending that they be robbed, etc. shall
come to the Constable, and pray him to make search for the felons, and going
with the Constable into a man's house to search they rob the good man of the
house, this is Burglary.

21. El.
9. In like manner if a servant conspiring with another to rob his master, shall
open his masters door, or window in the night and the other enters thereat,
Dalton ib.
this is Burglary in the stranger, by the opinion of Sir Roger Manwood, who was
an ingenious and learned Judge, and yet the house was not broken in any of
these cases.

10. But if one comes into a house in the day and there hides himself till
night and then steals any thing out of the house, or if any that is lodged in
a house in the night goes out of the house, and steals some of the goods yet
this is no Burglarie but only felony, for that he broke not the house, the
first of these two cases was resolved at Derby, Ass. 32. El. Cromp. 34.

11. Also if diverse come to commit Burglarie, and but one of them enters and
commits it, 11. H. 4. 13.
the rest standing about the house, or not far of to watch that no help
shall come, this is Burglary in all that company.

The place.
12. Now concerning the place, it may be either public or private, public as
the Church, or walls, or gates, of a City or walled Town, private as a
dwelling house, and here commonly it is no Burglarie, unless some person be at
that time within the house, And yet if a man has a dwelling house and he and
all his family (upon some occasion) are part of the night out of the house, Co.
4. 40.
and in the mean time one comes and breaks the house to commit felony,
this is Burglary.

13. So if a man has two dwelling houses, and sometimes dwells at the one,
Co. 4. 40.
and sometimes at the other, and has a family or servants in both, and in the
night when his servants are out of the house the house is broken by Thieves;
this is Burglary adjudged. 38. Eliz.

Cromp. 33.
14. If one breaks a chamber in any Innes of Court or Chancery or in any
College in a university in the night, to the intent to commit felony there,
this is Burglary, although there were no person in the same Chamber, For that
Colleges and houses of Court and Chancery be entire houses, whereof such
chamber is parcel; so that if any person shall be in any other chamber within
the same house or College at the same time it is Burglary.

2. Ed. 6. Br. Cor. 180. Lamb. 156.
15. Also the breaking (in the night) of a Stable, Barn, or other out house,
adjoining, or near to the dwelling house, to the intent to steal, is Burglary
though he take nothing.

16. At Summer Assizes at Cambridge Anno Domini 1616. two men were arraigned
and condemned for Burglary before Sir James Altham Knight for robbing a
Backhouse of Robert Castle Esquire in the night, Dalton page 293.
which Backhouse was some eight or nine yards distant from his dwelling house
and only a pale reaching between them: so that though this offense be not
committed in the very body of the dwelling house, but in some other house near
unto it, and being parcel of or belonging to the dwelling house, it is
Burglary.

17. But a Booth or Tent in a Fair or market, are not esteemed in Law for
dwelling houses, Co. 11. 37.
nor the breaking thereof in the night time to be Burglary, although the
robbing of them be made as penal as Burglarie, if the owner, his wife,
children or servants were within the same.

18. Lastly, 23. Ass. 95. Stamf. 126. Co. 11. 31.
to make it Burglary the purpose and intent for which the offend our comes,
must of necessity be to kill or rob some person, or to commit some other
felony, otherwise it is neither burglary nor felony. 13. H. 7. 4. F. Coro. 267.
And therefore to break a house in the night to the intent to kill any person
therein, it is Burglary, although he never touch him.

So it is, if the purpose were to rob, F Cor. 185. and 264.
although the offender takes away nothing.

19. Stamf. 30. co. 11. 31.
But if a man break and enter an house by night of purpose only to beat a
man, that is but trespass.

20. And if the intent were to commit a Rape, it is Burglary; for Rape by the
Common Law was felony, Stamf. 21. c. 22 and 23.
although some doubt have been made thereof, for it appears by Master
Bracton, Glanvill and Stamford, that by the ancient Common Law it was felony,
the words of Master Bracton lib. 2. are thus, Olim quidem corruptores
virginitatis and castitatis suspendebantur, etc. modernis tamen temporibus
aliter observatur, qui pro corruptione virginis amittuntur membra, etc. And a
little after Adelstanus; raptus mulierum ne fiat, defendit tam lex humana, quam
divina, Et sic fuit antiquitus observatum, quod si quis obviaverit solam, cum
pace dimittat eam, etc. Si autem contra voluntatem suam, etc. jactat eam ad
terram, forisfacit gratiam suam, etc. Felony.
Quod si concubucrit cum ea, de vita and membris suis incurrat damnum, etc. And
with this Master Glanvill also agrees, fol. 112. Also amongst the laws of
Saint Edmond sometimes King of England, you shall find this law, Qui cum Nunna,
vel sanctimoniali fornicetur, emendetur sicut homicida, a multo fortiori, then
says Master Stamford, shall he be punished, if he had ravished her; So as
Rape at the first says Stamford, West. 2. 34. P. Rapo. 1.
was grievously punished until the time of King Edward the first, who seemed
to mitigate the pain thereof, by the statute of West. 1. ca. 13. which gave
two years imprisonment and fine; but spying the mischiefs ensuing upon the
said law, at his next Parliament holden at West. called West. 2. ca. 34. he
made the offense of Rape to be felony again. Br. Coron. 204.

21. Note also by Britton, f. 17. Cromp. 33. See Plo. 19. 2.
it is not Burglary in an Infant under 14. years of age, nor in poor persons
that upon hunger shall enter a house for victual under the value of 12.d. Nor
in natural fools, or other persons that be Non compos mentis, but the case
of poor entering for victual at this day, may as I conceive admit this
difference, that is, where a poor body that is ready to starve with hunger
breaks into a house, and takes no more than to satisfy his present hunger,
for the safeguard of his life, this is neither Burglary nor Felony: for all
Laws, as well the Laws of God as of men, in many cases are dispensed withal,
by unevitable necessity, as appears in Master Plowdens Commentaries, fo. 19.
but if he that so enters takes away more than might suffice to satisfy his
hunger for that time, I conceive that he is guilty of Burglary.

Other Felonies by the Common Law, as Burning houses, etc. CHAP. 17.
21. H. 7. 1. Co. 4. 10.
1. BUrning of a Barn (which is adjoining, or near to a dwelling house) in the
night feloniously, is felony by the Common Law.

2. So is it to burn a Barn in the day time, having Corn in it, though it
adjoyne not to the dwelling house.

3. H. 7. 10. 1. Co. ^1 ^9. Stamf. 36.
3. Burning of any dwelling house, or other house parcel thereof, willingly and
feloniously done, is felony by the Common Law, whether it be done by night or
by day.

4. Burning of any other house, or of a stack of Corn feloniously, Stamf. 36.
seems also to be felony by the Common Law, for the words of the statute of
West. 1. ca. 15. (which statute seems to be but a rehersall of the Common
Law, Br. Mainp. 78.) ordains that such as be taken for burning (generally)
feloniously done, be not bailed: and of that opinion seems Master Britton,
13. H 8. ca. 1. in Ireland.
who wrote presently after the making of the same statute to be; Britton fol.
16. See Stat. Winchester 13. Ed. 1. ca. 1. and 18. Ed. 1. ca. 17. but all these
cases by a statute in Ireland are Treason.

5. If an Indictor (or Iuror) in case of Treason or felony shall discover the
Kings Council and his fellows; it has been adjudged felony in times past,
but as the Law is now taken, it is a misdemeanor only.

Resco^^. 1. H 7. 6. Br. Coron. 127 130. Stamf 31. b. E^cape. 9 H ^. Dalton
page 24^. Breaking of pr^son. Stamf. 30. 31. See the stat. 1. Ed. 2. and P.
^rison. 5.
6. Rescuing, or taking away from an officer, any offendour who is attainted,
imprisoned, or but arrested for felony, is felony as well in him that made the
Rescous as in him that is rescued.

7. Also when a man has arrested another for felony, and after lets him go
at liberty, this is a wilful escape, and shall be adjudged felony in him that
did so let him escape; And in case of Treason such escape is Treason. per
Stamf. fo. 32. and 1. H. 6. 6.

8. Breaking of prison (before the statute de frangentibus prisonam made 1.
Edw. 2.) was felony by the Common Law, for what cause soever he were in prison,
yea though he had been imprisoned but for a Trespass: But now that stat. has
changed the common Law therein; so that now if a man be arrested or taken for a
Trespass, and do make an escape, or be rescued by a stranger, this is but
fineable at this day.

Robbery. CHAP. 18.
1. THeft is the taking away of another man's goods with an intent to steal
them against the will, or without the knowledge of him whose goods they are,
and this is of two sorts, videlicet, Robbery and La^ceny, we will first speak
of Robbery, and then of Larceny, Robbery (in latin called Rapina) is properly
the felonious taking of any thing from the person of another against his will,
Dyer. 224. Stamf. ^7 d.
and putting him in fear thereby, and here although the thing taken, be but to
the value of an half penny, yet it is felony, for which the offender shall
suffer death without benefit of Clergy. As if one by the high way assaulteth
me and takes away my purse, money, or other goods.

2. 9 Ed. 4. 28. Stamf. 27.
But if a Thief assaulteth me to rob me and bideth me deliver my purse, but
takes nothing from me, in regard that I being to good for him, shall
apprehend him, or shall levye Huy, and Cry, whereby he is taken, this is taken
to be no Robbery, nor felony at this day; Stamf. 7. g.
And yet the assault only to rob me has been in former times, holden to be
felony, as appears by the books. 27. Ass. pl. 38. and 13. H. 4. 7. 25. Ed.
3. Fitz. Coron. 106. 215.

3. In this former description of robbery, 20. Eliz. Cromp. 34.
the word taking is largely to be extended against the offender, so that
although the Thief takes nothing from my person, yet if he assaulteth me,
and upon his assault he threatens to kill me; If I deliver him not my purse,
and thereupon I cast my purse down upon the ground, and he takes it away,
this is Robbery.

4. Cromp. 34.
So if one draws his sword upon me and bids me deliver my purse, and I
refuse, and after he prays me to give him a penny, and I do so, yet it
seems this is robbery, for by the assault I was put in fear, and out of that
fear I gave him this money to be rid of him.

5. So if a Thief do only assault me to rob me, Stamf 7. c.
and I deliver him my purse with my own hand; yet this is robbery in regard
this fact of mine proceeded from fear, or by his menacing, etc.

6. So if in flying from the Thief I cast my purse into a Bush to save it, and
the Thief sees me and takes it away, this is robbery; Cromp. 35.
for in this case had he not put me in fear, I should not have cast my money
from me.

7. So if one assaults me to rob me, and I flying away from him, Cromp. 35.
my hat falls of, and the Thief takes it up, and carries it away, this is
robbery.

8. So if a Thief comes and bids me deliver my purse (without drawing any
weapon, 20. El. Cromp. 34.
or other force used) and I deliver him my purse, and he finding but two
shillings therein delivers me all again, yet this is Robbery.

44. Ed. 3. 14. 4. H. 4. 3. Stamf. 27. f.
9. So if Thieves do take a man, and by threats compel him to swear to bring
them money, at another time, or else that they will kill him, by force whereof,
he brings them the money accordingly this is Robbery.

10. Also in the former description of Robbery the words from the person, are
not so nicely to be construed, that to make up robbery the goods must needs be
annexed to the body of the person; For in some cases it may be Robbery
notwithstanding the Thief does neither take the goods from the person of the
owner nor yet assault him; Stamf. 27.
As if in my presence, a felon with a felonious intent takes away my goods
openly against my will, this is robbery though he neither takes them from my
person, nor assaulteth me, for the loss is the same, and the fear alike as
though it had been from my person.

P.R. 131.
11. And if one or more do with a felonious intent take a horse out of my
pasture or drive my Cattle out of my ground I standing by and looking on at
the same time, this is robbery, if so be that the felon does either make an
assault upon me, or do put me in fear.

12. Note to make it robbery the person must be put in fear, for if a felon
do take money from me in the high way, and shall not put me in fear, this is
felony but not Robbery. Cromp. 35. P.R. 131.

Dyer. 224.
13. And you shall find a case in my Lord Dyer, how a felon did take money to
the value of xl.s. or above, from the person of another, in the highway. And
yet for that he did not put his person in fear by assault and violence, this
was holden no robbery and the offender was allowed his Clergy for the same
felony. Anno. 5. Eliz.

14. Note also, if two Thieves shall attempt to rob me, and I fly from them,
Cromp. 34.
and one of the Thieves follow me, and the other espying another true man (but
our of the sight of his fellow) rides toward him and robbed him, this was
adjudged Robbery in both the Thieves, and yet the one was neither in sight, or
knowing of this Robbery, but because they both came to rob, and at the same
time, this fact committed by the one shall be imputed to the other; Also it was
one Pudseys case, 28. El.

Cutpurse.
15. If one shall cut my purse, or take or pick my purse out of my pocket
secretly or privily and fraudulently, it is felony of death but not without
benefit of Clergy in Ireland. Cromp. 34. 35.


16. So if one shall take my money or other goods from my person secretly
without my knowledge, or by sleight only, I neither being made afraid, nor
witting of it (if it be above xij.d. in value) it is felony of death.

16. Elix. Cromp. 35.
17. A man cutteth my girdle privily, my purse hanging thereat, and the purse
and girdle fall to the ground, but he did not take them up (for that he was
espied) this is no felony, for that the Thief never had an actual possession
thereof, severed from my person; But if he had holden the purse in his hand and
then cut the girdle, although it had fallen to the ground, and that he took it
up no more, then had it been felony (if there had been above xij.d. in the
purse) for he had it once in his possession: But these secret and privy takings
from my person are no robbery for he neither assaulted me nor put me in any
fear.

Larcenie. CHAP. 19.
1. LArcenie (being fetched from the latin word Latrocinium) is properly a
fraudulent and felonious taking away of another man's personal goods, in the
absence of the owner and without his knowledge.

2. This is of two sorts, Grand Larceny which is felony of death and Pety
Larceny which is forfeiture of goods and Chattels, and corporal punishment at
the discretion of the Judges.

3. Grand Larceny, Grand Larceny.
is when the goods stolen be above the value of xij.d. and this is felony of
death sc. wherein Judgment of death shall be given upon the offender, except
he be saved by his book.

4. And yet if the goods stolen be to the value of ten shillings, F. Cor. 451.
if the Jury that passes upon his arraignement shall find that the goods did
not exceed the value of xij.d. then that offense shall be taken but for Pety
Larceny.

5. Pety Larceny. West. 1. c. 15. Br. Cor. 84. and 85.
Pety Larceny is when the goods stolen do not exceed the value of xij.d. and
for this the offender shall be imprisoned for some certain time, and after
shall be whipped, or otherwise punished by the discretion of the Justices
before whom he was arraigned, but it is not felony of death.

6. Yet may not the Justice of peace before whom such an offender shall be
brought (out of the Sessions) punish by his discretion the said offender for
Pety Larceny and so let him go, but must commit him to prison or bail him, to
the intent he may come to his trial as in case of other felonies, and if upon
his trial the Jury shall find the goods stolen, to exceed xij.d. in value,
the offender shall have Judgment to dye for the fault.

7. Although Pety Larceny be not punishable by death, 29. H. 8. 22. F. Coro.
218. Br Cor. 2. 84. 85. and 2^6.
yet it is a felonious taking, for the indictment of Pety Larceny must be
felonice cepit, and he shall forfeite all his goods and Chattells for such a
felony, and there is no difference either in the nature of the offense or in
the mind of the offender, but only in the value of the thing stolen which
makes the difference of punishment.

8. If one shall steal goods to the value of 4. F. Coro. 415. Stamf 24. Crom.
36. 2.
d. at one time and vj.d. at another time, and of iij.d. at another time which
together do exceed the value of xij.d. and that these several goods be all
stolen from one and the same person, then may they be put together in one
Indictment, and the offender, being thereupon arraigned and found guilty, shall
have judgment of death.

F. Coro. 440. Stamf. 24. 1.
9. Again, if two or more together do steal goods above the value of 12. d.
this is felony of death in them all, for the felony in them is several, though
the stealing be jointly done.

10. In Larcenie two things must concur, scil. to take, and to carry away,
The manner.
or remove the thing taken, with a purpose to steal the same, for the
indictment must be, Cepit and asportavit, or cepit and abduxit, and yet in
these words, the letter is not so much to be insisted upon, as the meaning, and
that for the better suppressing of offenders in this kind. For although by
the Law in Master Glanvils time a furto omnimodo excusatur, qui initium
habuerit suae detentionis, per dominum illius rei, yet at this day it may be
felony, though the offendour take not the thing, but comes first unto it by
delivery from the owners own hand, and so comes lawfully to the possession.
As if a Taverner do set a piece of plate before his guest to drink in, 13 Ed.
4 9. Stamf. 25.
and the guest carries it away, this is felony, for the Taverner gave him no
possession thereof, but only the use to drink in it for the time. Or if I
deliver goods to a Carrier, or other person, and bargain with him to carry
them to a certain place appointed, if he carries them to the place, and then
convayeth them away fraudulently, this is felony, for the privity of bailement
was determined when they came at the place appointed. So if the Carrier shall
take out parcel of the goods, this is felony; and likewise if the Carrier
shall carry them to another place, and there breaks them up, and converteth
part, or all, to his own use, this is felony; but if the Carrier shall sell or
give away, or otherwise imbezell the whole, as he received them, this is holden
to be no felony, because it was delivered him in the same kind. Stamf. 25. a.
Cromp. 36. a.

11. And yet in this last case there is besides the delivery a bargain and
agreement to carry the goods, and the delivery was only to that intent, so that
the property of those goods did always remain in the first owner. But if A.
lends his horse to B. being a stranger, who rides quite away with the horse,
this is no felony in B. by reason of the delivery. And so did Sir John
Dodderidge Knight give direction at Cambridge Assizes, 1617. upon an Indictment
of Felony preferred in such a case.

12. If a Clothier shall deliver any Wool or Yarne to his Carder, Spinster, or
Weaver, etc. to dress, and they shall convay away, imbezell or sell any part
thereof, this seems to be no felony, by reason of the delivery.

13. Ed 4. 9.
13. So if I deliver my goods to another to keep, and he fraudulently consumes
them, or otherwise converteth them to his own profit, this is no felony,
because of the delivery.

14. And so (it seems) if I deliver money or goods to A. to deliver to B. and
A. flies away with them, consumes them, or converteth them to his own use,
this is no felony by reason of the delivery.

15. If a man delivers money to his servant to keep, Servants.
or plate to his Butler, or vessel to his Cook, or horse to his horse keeper,
13. E. 4. 10. 3. H. 7. 12. 21. H. 7. 15.
or Sheep to his Shepherd, and such servant does go away with them, this is
felony by the common Law in that servant (for these goods were always in the
master possession, and kept and used by the servant to the masters behoof) But
yet there was much difference of opinions herein, 33. H. 8. ca. 5. in Ireland.
for the clearing whereof (in some part) a statute was in the time of King H.
8. made, whereby it was provided that all and singular servants of the age of
Eighteen years, Cromp. 50.
other than an Apprentice (which must be understood of such as are bound by
Indenture, and by the name of an Apprentice) to whom any money, Apprentices and
servants under the age of Eighteen shall be in case as they were before the
making of this statute.
goods or Chattells, etc. by his or their master or mistress shall be
delivered to keep of the value of xl.s. or above, if such servant shall go
away with, or shall imbezell, or shall convert to his own use, any such money
goods, or Chattells of the said value, to the intent to steal the same, or to
defraud his Master or Mistress thereof, it shall be felony, but this must be
prosecuted within one year after the offense.

16. And now upon the construction of this stat. diverse new questions and
cases have since been moved. Dyer. 5.
As if a man deliver an obligation to his servant to go and receive the money
thereupon due, and the servant receives the money and then goes away
therewith, or does convert it to his own use, this is holden to be no felony
within the meaning of this statute for the Master did not deliver the money to
his servant; So if a man delivers to his servant wares, Ibid.
or cattle to sell at Fair or market, and he sells them there, and
receives the money, and then goes away with the money, or converteth it to
his own use, this is no felony within this statute, for he had not the money
by his masters delivery, Dyer. 5.
neither went he away with the goods his master delivered him.

17. But if the servant received of his master 20. l. in gold to keep, 28. El.
Cromp. 35.
which he changed into silver, and then ran away with that, this is felony, for
that gold and silver are both of the same nature, sc. money.

18. And if a man delivers to his servant a horse to ride to market, or money
to carry to a Fair, to buy cattle, or other things, 21. H. 7. 15.
or to pay to another man, and the servant goes away therewith, this was no
felony by the common Law, by reason of the delivery thereof to him by his
Master, but it seems to be felony by this statute, for that he went away with
the thing delivered him.

19. And if one of my, Dyer. 5.
servants does deliver to another of my servants goods of mine (to the value of
40. s.) and he does go away therewith, or converteth them to his own use:
this is felony within this statute, for this shall be said, my delivery.

5. H. 7. 16. Br. Property 25.
20. If a man delivers to his servant a piece of Cloth to keep, and the servant
makes himself a garment thereof, and after goes away therewith, this is
felony (within this statute) for that the property is not altered, Cromp. 50.
by the making a garment thereof, because the Cloth may be known still,
Otherwise it is of Barley turned into Malt, or of money melted or turned into
a wedge or piece of metal, or the like, for that in these cases the Barley,
or money cannot be known again but are altered in their kind.

Cromp. 50.
21. If any receiver of my rears receives x. li. of my Tenants and run away
therewith, it is no felony; for the statute is where the master delivers to
keep.

22. If a man delivers to his servant, the key of the chamber door, and the
servant takes away his masters goods in the chamber (above the value of xij.d.
13. Ed. 4. 9.
) this is felony at the common Law, for the goods were not delivered.

23. Another felony there is by the stat. 33. H. 6. c. 1. in the servants that
shall take away or spoil the goods of their deceased master, P. Felon. 11. P.
Exec. 5.
but this felony grows upon their default of appearance in the K. bench after
proclamation, and therefore neither the trial nor hearing thereof belongs to
the Justices of peace, because they cannot well take knowledge of such default
in the K. Bench.

24. The second thing which must concur in Larceny to make it felony is the
carrying away of the thing so taken, and yet it is not of necessity that it be
clean carried out of the house, or place where it was, but it suffices that
it be so far removed that the evil and felonious intent of the taker may
plainly appear; 27. Ass. 39. See Stamf. 26. b. Br. Cor. 107.
As if a guest will feloniously take the sheets or other goods of the
In-keepers, out of the chamber where he lodges, and then (going to the stable
for his horse) is taken with them or they be found in some other Room of the
house, where he had laid them, it is felony in both cases, although the
possession of those goods continued in the owner.

25. So is it if one takes a horse in another man's close with an intent to
steal him, and he be apprehended again before he has gotten the horse out of
the same close, this is felony. Now it is necessary in the next Chapter to
declare of what things Larceny may be committed, and of what not.

Of what things Larceny may be committed, and of what not. CHAP. 20.
1. NOte that the felonious taking of any thing, wherein another has
property, is felony. 22. H. 6. Br. Coron. 190.

2. And therefore Larcenie may be committed by taking of any the moveable goods
of any person, Moveable goods.
as money, plate, apparel, household stuff, or Corn, hay, Trees or fruit
(that are severed from the ground) or the like, the stealing of them is felony.

3. It is also felony to steal my horses, mares, colts, oxen, kyne, sheep,
lambs, swine, pigs, hens or geese, ducks, turkies, peacocks, Domestical.
and other domestical beasts or birds of tame nature. 18. H. 8. 2.

4. It is Felony also to take some things that be of wild nature, Stamf. 25. c.
18. E. 4. so. 8.
as to take young pigeons which cannot fly, out of another man's Dovehouse, so
to take young Hawks or young herons out of their nests (or ayries) and breeding
in a park or other several ground, so to take fishes that be kept in a Trunk
or several pond.

5. Br. Cor. 89. 22. Ass. 95. 12. H. 8. 9 b. 16. E. 4. 7. 2.
So of old Doves taken in the Dove coat (in the night time especially) And so
it seems of any other wild beast of foul (being of value) and taken within a
man's house.

6. Also it is Felony to take any Swannes that be lawfully marked, though they
be at large; For a man has property in such. See Co. lib. 7. fo. 16. b. 17. a.

7. Also for Swannes unmarked, if they be domestical or tame, sc. kept in a
moat, or in ponds near to a dwelling house, and so be domui, or manui
assueta, to steal such is felony. See Coke 7. 17. b.

8. So it seems of Swannes unmarked, so long as they keep within a man's
Manor, or within his private Rivers, or if they happen to escape out of a man's
Manor or private rivers, yet if they shall be pursued and taken, and brought
in again, to steal them is felony. Co. li. 7. fo. 16. and 18.

9. But if Swannes that be unmarked, shall be abroad, and shall attain to
their natural liberty, then the property of them is lost, And so long Felony
cannot be committed by taking of them.

10. And yet such unmarked and wild Swans, the Kings officer may seize them
(being abroad) for and to the use of the King by his prerogative, they being
volatilia regalia. Also the King by grant them; And by consequence another man
may prescribe to have them within a certain precinct or place. For it may be
intended to have a lawful beginning by the Kings grant, Cok. lib. 7. fol. 16.
a. b. and 18. a. b.

11. Also it is felony to take a tame Dear, 10. E. 4. 15. Stamf. 25. c.
which is marked and domestical (especially if the taker knows it to be tame,
or that it wears a Bell.

12. But by the common law Larceny cannot be committed by taking of savage or
wild beasts, fowls, or fish, found in their wildness and abroad, or at
large, as Dear, Conies, Hawks, Doves, Phesants, Partridges, Herons, Swans
unmarked, or fish that are at liberty, etc. for no person can claim property
in them.

13. P. Felon. 24.
Howbeit by stat. it is made felony to hunt Dear or Conies (after some sort)
in a Forest, park or warren, or to take a tame beast, or other thing, in a
park, by manner of robbery. See 3. Ed. 1. 20. and 1. H. 7. ca. 7.

P. Felon. 26.
14. Also by statute it is felony to steal, take away or conceal, a Hawke that
is reclaimed.

Co. 7. 17. b.
15. But for the better understanding what the Law is, in things that be fera
natura, observe these differences.

Properry.
16. In some things that be fera natura, a man has a right of property, and in
some of them a right of privilege.

17. There be three manner of rights of property, scil.

1. Absolute. This property a man cannot have in any thing which is ferae
natura, but only in such things as are Domitae natura. 2. Qualified, These
properties a man may have in things ferae natura, and to such properties a man
may attain by two means, scil. 3. Possessary, These properties a man may have
in things ferae natura, and to such properties a man may attain by two means,
scil.
1. By industry, and this may be, either by taking them only or making them
tame, scil. mansueta, id est, manui assueta, or domestica, id est, domus
assueta; but in these last a man has but a qualified property, scil. so long
as they remain tame, and so long felony may be committed by stealing of them
away, but if they attain to their natural liberty, and have not animum
revertendi, then the property of them is lost.

2. Ratione impotentiae and loci, As where a man has young Goshawkes, or
Herons, or the like, which are fera natura, and do breed (or ayrie) in his
ground, he has a possessorie property in them. So as if one takes them when
they cannot fly, the owner of the soil may have an Action of trespass, Quare
boscum suum fregit, and tres pullos esperuorum suorum, or ardearum suarum,
pretii tantum nuper in eodem bosco nidificant, cepit and asportavit. And to
take these away is felony, as is aforesaid. 18. E. 4. fol. 8. Stamf. 25. c.

18. But when a man has beasts or fowls (that be savage and in their
wildenesse) ratione privilegii, scil. by reason of a park or warren, See Doct.
and Student. fo. 10.
etc. as Dear, Hares, Conies, Phesants, or Partridges, or the like, (which be
things of warren) he has no property in them. And therefore in an action quare
parcum or warrennam, etc. fregit and intravit, and 3. damas, lepores,
cuniculos, phesiones, perdices, etc. cepit and asportavit, he shall not say
suos, for that he has no property in them, but they belong unto him Ratione
privilegii, (for his game and pleasure) so long as they remain in the place
privileged; And if the owner of the Park dye his heir shall have them, and
not his executor or administrator, for that without them, the Park (which is
an inheritance) is not complete, neither can felony be committed by taking of
them.

19. Neither can Larceny be committed by taking of dogs of any kind, Apes,
Parrats, Squirrils, singing Birds, or such like thing (kept only for pleasure
and not for any profit) though they be in the house, and made tame.

20. No not by taking of a blood-hound or mastiffe, Co. 7. 18. 12 H. 8. 3. Br.
Trespass. 407.
although that there is good use of them, and that a man can be said to have a
property in them, so as an action of Trespass lies fortaking them; yet in
regard they are things of so base a nature, no felony can be committed by
taking them.

21. Also it is felony to steal the flesh of any tame or wild foul, Stamf.
25. c.
or beast, that is dead, out of the possession of another man.

22. So is it to pull the wool from the sheep back, Cromp. 36.
or to kill them, and to take the skin; and leave the body behind.

23. But note that in all these cases of felony aforesaid, the thing so taken,
or stolen, must exceed the value of 12. d.

24. Also the taking of any real chartell or thing, is no felony, Things real.
as if one cuts down my Tree, or my corn, and carries it away, Stamf. 25. c.
or pulls and steals my Apples hanging on the Tree, and carries them away,
these are no Felony; for these things be part of my Freehold till they be
severed.

25. But if I gather mine Apples, or cut down a Tree, Stamf. 25.
or Corn of mine own, then it is felony if another shall carry them away
feloniously.

26. And if a stranger cuts down my Tree, Cromp. 36.
or Corn without Title, and another time after fetches it away, that will
prove no Felony by 12. Ass. P. 32. Br. Coron. 76.

27. Also to take lead from of a house, or Church, Cromp. 37.
will not amount to felony, for it is parcel of the house or freehold.

28. Also to take away the Evidences of a man's land, Stamf. 25. 10. Ed. 4. 14.
Br. Cor. 155.
or an Indenture of lease, or other writings (be they within or without a
Box,) it is no felony, because they cannot be valued, and again, because they
concern inheritance, chattels, reals or things in action.

29. So to take away an Infant in Ward is no Felony. Stamf. 25.


30. Also the taking and carrying away of such things whereof the owner is
unknown, in some cases is no felony; Stamf. 25. Br. Cor. 187. 265.
As the taking away of treasure that was hidden, wreck of the Sea or goods that
shall be wayved, or strayed, (before they be lawfully seized, etc.) But the
takers away of such treasure that was hidden, wrecke and waife, shall be
punished by fine and imprisonment. 22. Ass. p. 99. Br. Coron. 96.

31. And yet where the goods be, bona cujusdam hominis ignoti, Dyer. 99. and
476. 478. 7. E. 4. 14. 15. Br. indictment 33.
or bona cujusdam mortui, and ignoti, or bona parochianorum, or the goods of a
Church, or Chapel, or the goods of any corporation in the time of vacation,
in these cases there be owners of them to some purpose and therefore it is
felony to steal such goods.

32. One Nottingham dug a dead body out of his grave, and took away his
winding-sheete, Dalton page 244.
this was holden to be no felony (but punishable as a misdemeanor,) and the
offender was adjudged to be whipped for it, this was at Cambridge Summer
Assizes, Anno 1617.

7. H 6. 43. 5. H. 7. 18. Stamf. 16. 2.
33. Note also that a man may commit felony by taking his own goods, as if A.
do lend, or deliver goods to B. to keep, and after A. does take them away
feloniously, or privily and fraudulently (to the intent to charge B. or to
recover damages for the same against B. by an action of detinue) this is felony
in A. and yet the property of the goods were in him.

Mar. lect. 12. Cromp. 27.
34. So it is if I lend my plate, or deliver my goods to another to keep, and
he melts my plate, or changes the fashion of my goods, now if I should take
that metal, or those goods feloniously it were felony in me, because the
property is altered by altering of the fashion.

Cromp. 37. P. R. 129.
35. A man finds my purse in the highway, and being asked thereof, denies
it, this seems to be no felony; for he came not thereby at the first
feloniously, but the denial is a strong evidence that he came by it
feloniously, if he cannot clearly prove how he came by it.

36. A man comes to my wife, or to my servant with a false message, token, or
letter made in my name, and thereby gets my goods, yet this is no felony,
but it shall be punished as a falsity and misdemeanor, and the offend or
besides a Fine and imprisonment may be bound to the good behavior by the
Common Law.

What persons are chargeable in Larcenie. CHAP. 21.
27. Ass 40. Stamf. 26.
1. A Feme covert does steal goods by the compulsion of her husband, this is no
felony in her. F. Coron. 160.

Mar. lect. 12.
2. But if by the compulsion of her husband, she commits murder, this is
felony in them both.

27. Ass. 40. See Stamf. 142. c. and 26. 27.
3. If a Feme covert does steal good by the commandment of her husband
(without other constraint) this has been holden to be felony in her, Master
Bracton also says it is felony; For licet uxor obedire debeat viro, in
atrocioribus tamen non est ei obediendum, but Master Stamf. and others seem to
be of another opinion, Stamf. 26. P. R. 130. Br. Coron. 108.

F. Cor. 1^0.
4. If the husband and the wife together do steal goods, this shall be taken
to be the only Act of the husband, and not to be felony in the wife, Stamf. 26.

5. But a woman covert, alone by her self (the husband not knowing thereof)
may commit Larceny and may be either principal, Stamf. 26.
or accessory, as if she steal another man's goods, or receive the Thief that
steals them, or shall receive stolen goods into her house knowing them so to
be, F. Coro. ^83. See Stamf. 26.
or shall lock them up in her Chest, or Chamber, her husband not knowing
thereof, and in such case if her husband so soon as he knows thereof do
forthwith forsake his house and her company, and makes his aboade elsewhere,
he shall not be charged for her offense, whereas otherwise the Law will impute
the fault to him and not to her. P. R. 130.

6. Goods are delivered to the husband to keep, and his wife steals them, it
is no felony; Otherwise is it if the husband had delivered them to a stranger
and then the wife had taken them feloniously out of the possession of the
stranger, this had been felony in the wife, Mar. lect. 12.

7. F. Cor. 455. Br. Cor. 141. Stamf. 27.
Also the wife shall not be accounted a Felon for taking or stealing the goods
of her husband. And if the wife do take her husbands goods secretly, and
delivers them to a stranger knowing thereof, yet this is no felony in the
stranger.

8. Br. Cor. 77. 1^. Ass. p. 6. Stamf. fo. 34. 1^. E. 32. Cromp. 35. P. R. 130.
But if a man do take away another man's wife with her husbands goods, against
the wives will, this is felony by the statute. Westminster. 2. cap. 34. as it
seems, and so if a man takes away another man's wife, with her husbands goods
against the husbands will, this is also felony.

9. And if the husband commits Larceny, and the wife knowing thereof, do
receive or retain him, etc. she is not thereby accessory to the felony.

10. If a servant by the compulsion of his Master, Servant.
steals another man's goods, this is felony in them both.

11. An Idiot, Lunaticke, dumb and deaf person and an Infant are chargeable
in Larceny after the same sort, Idiot. Infant.
as they are chargeable in homicide, which see here before in manslaughter. And
yet if an Infant shall commit Larceny and shall be found guilty thereof before
the Iu. of P. it shall not be amiss for them to respit the judgment, and so
has it often been done by the Judges, See Stamf. 27. and 3. H. 7. fo. 1. b.
and 12. b. and 35. H. 6. 11. Br. Coverture. 80.

Felonies by escape. CHAP. 22.
1. BReaking of prison by one being therein for felony, 1. Ed. 2. P. Felon. 15.
or by one being a prisoner for felony, is felony by the statute de
frangentibus prisonum, and so it was by the common Law: Now every one who is
under arrest for felony is a prisoner, and that as well without the prison, as
within or in the stocks, in the high street, or in the possession of any that
has arrested him, 1. Ed. 3. 17. P. R. 147.
or that has the keeping of him being arrested for felony; And therefore if
any person who is under arrest for felony or suspicion thereof, whether he be
in the jail, or out, or but in the stocks, or but in the possession of any
that has arrested him, if he shall make an escape, this is a breaking of
prison in such prisoner, and is felony.

2. Note that there is no difference, 2. Ed. 3. 1.
whose prison the offender does break, whether it be the Kings prison, the
Lords of a Franchise or any other persons: 1. H. 7. 6.
And if a stranger does break the prison or open the Stocks, 1. Ed. 3. 17.
Dyer. 99.
or make a rescous, whereby one imprisoned or arrested for felony escapes,
this is felony both in the prisoner, and in the stranger, although the prisoner
was never indicted of the felony.

9. H 4. 1. F. Cor. 333. Stamf. 3^. a.
3. By some opinions if a stranger shall disturb the arresting of a felon, it
is no felony, except the felon were taken and arrested, and after rescued, yet
Fitz. Just. P. fo. 114. says that such disturbance before arrest, is felony,
which I conceive cannot be, for where there is no arrest, there cannot be any
escape or rescous, yet nevertheless this disturbance is a misdemeanor
punishable by fine and imprisonment.

1. H. 6. 7.
4. If a prisoner be rescued at the gallows, or as he is in going to execution,
this is a breaking of prison, and felony.

5. If a Jailer, a Constable, or any other, which has a prisoner under arrest
for felony, P R. 147. 149. 44. Ass. 12. Br. E^^. 31. Stamf. 31.
or suspicion thereof, voluntarily lets or suffers him to go at liberty,
this is felony in the jailer or him that letteh such prisoner escape, but it is
no felony in the prisoner, but if such a prisoner shall escape by the
negligence of his keeper, then the felony rests in the prisoner only and not
in the Jailer, etc.

P. R. 149. 150. 9. H 4. 1. Stamf. fo. 32. and 26.
6. The voluntary letting of a felon escape, which is not arrested for felony,
though he knows of the felony, yet it is not felony, neither can it be an
escape without an arrest, and yet such an offender (being an officer) may for
such his negligence or default be indicted and fined, as it seems by the
words of the Commission, but by 9. H. 4. fo. 1. Br. Escape 43. and F. Coron. p.
76. he is accessory to the felony.

Dyer. 44. a.
7. Note that a man is always said to be in prison, so long as he is within the
sight of the jailer, or of him that has him in custody, though he does break
away or escape.

8. And if a prisoner shall make an escape (of his own wrong, and without the
consent of the Jailer, ^tamf 33. b. Br. Esc. 4^5.
or other person that has him in custody) though he escape out of their
sight, and into another County, yet if he be taken again upon fresh suite,
before the jailer, etc. be sued or fined for the escape (though it be seven
years after) yet this is no escape, as it seems, for which the officer shall
be charged, for there is no prejudice to the King by the escape, though it be
felony in the prisoner, as aforesaid, and a breaking of prison in him. Co. 3.
44. and 52. accords in case of a prisoner taken in execution that shall make
an escape of his own wrong.

9. If a Jailer or other officer, etc. shall license his prisoner to go
abroad, Co. 3. 44. Stamf. 33. c.
for a time, and to come again, this is an escape, because the prisoner is
found out of the bounds of his prison, though the prisoner return again
according as he shall be prescribed, and so is it, if the officer shall suffer
his prisoner to go abroad for a time, by bail or baston, Fitz. Cor. 243. and
431.
this is an escape, yet they are holden in both cases to be but negligent
escapes in the officer, and so but fineable, and yet the jailer and other
officers ought to keep their prisoners in salva and arcta custodia.

10. Note that the Sheriff of every County shall have the keeping of and shall
be chargeable and charged with the common jail and prison of the same County,
and of all the prisoners therein; And must put in such Gaolers or keepers for
whom he will answer as appears by the statute 14. E. 3. c. 10. which also
seems to have been the common Law before, as you may see by the preamble of
the statute of 14. E. 3. and Co. 4. 34. And therefore the high Sheriff
himself shall be answerable for an escape of a felon, suffered by his jailer,
and may be indicted for the same. And so the high Sheriff as he has an office
of great antiquity, and of great trust and authority, Co. 4. 331
for the time: So withal it is a place of great peril and charge; And if the
rigor of Law should be laid upon him, Co. 9. 98.
then should he have a bad office. But in such cases I have observed the
favorable exposition and dealing of the learned and reverend Judges. First you
shall find in Sir Ed. Cook Reports, lib. 9. fol. 98. that the gaolers who
have the actual possession shall be answerable for escapes if they have
wherewith. Also Popham chief Justice, did cause one Staner (a jailer at
Cambridge) to be indicted, Temp. Eliz.
arraigned and hanged for an escape of a felon suffered by him.

11. Now an escape is of two sorts, voluntary and negligent.

12. Voluntary escape is where one does arrest, or has imprisoned another for
felony (or other offense) and after lets him go at liberty whither he will.
Stamf. 32.


13. Negligent escape is when the party arrested or imprisoned does escape
against the will of him that arrested or imprisoned him, Stamf. 33.
and is not freshly pursued and taken again before he has lost the sight of
him, the penalty thereof seems to be only a fine at the discretion of the
Judges or Justices, yet see Stamf. 35. K. a difference of the fine where the
prisoner is attainted, where but indicted, and where only taken upon suspicion.

14. But for voluntary escape, if the arrest or imprisonment were for felony it
shall be adjudged felony in him which did voluntarily suffer the prisoner to
escape; And if the arrest, etc. were for Treason, Stamf. 32. 1.
it shall be adjudged Treason: And if the arrest or imprisonment were for
Trespass it shall be adjudged Trespass; F. Cor. 248.
And yet see Fitz. Coron. 248. Escape non adjudicabitur pro transgressione, And
in case of felony there is no difference, whether the felon be arrested by an
Officer or by another, See Br. Coron. 112.

15. One Nichols assaulted Cholmelcy to rob him and killed him, after Qu. Eliz.
granted Nichols his pardon, But Cholmeley his wife having commenced her appeal
against Nichols he was still detained in prison at the woman's suite, after the
jailer suffered Nich. voluntarily to go at large, and so to escape, by the
opinion of Master Plowden this was felony in the jailer, although N. the
prisoner were no felon as to the Qu. in regard he had obtained his pardon.
Plo. 476. b.

16. A prisoner found guilty of pety Larceny is adjudged to be imprisoned by
the space of a month, F. Cor. 430. and 431.
for his punishment, and after the month he breaks prison and escapes, It
is holden that the Jailer shall be charged with this escape, P. R. 150.
But if a prisoner shall be discharged (by judgment) paying his fees, if he
escape, here the Jailer is not chargeable, the difference is, the prisoner in
the first case was by judgment committed to prison, and in the last case he is
adjudged to be acquit of his imprisonment paying, etc. 21. H. 7. 17. a. Br.
Escape 16.

17. Note that a voluntary escape is no felony, if the Act done were not felony
at the time of the escape made; 11. H. 7. 12. Plo. 258. 263. and 401.
As if A. do strike B. and hurt him mortally, whereupon the Constables do
arrest A. and after willingly suffer him to escape, and after B. dies of that
stroke, this escape is no felony either in the Constables, or in the prisoner,
yet the Constables shall make a great Fine, yea they shall be fined to the
value of there goods (as it seems by 11. H. 4. 12. and Stamf. 35. h. because
this escape was voluntary.

Cromp. 39.
18. The voluntary suffering him to escape, who has killed another Se
defendendo, or by misadventure, or of him that has committed pety Larceny
seems not to be felony, for that these offenses are no felony of death, but
he that suffers such an escape, shall be fined only. Cromp. 39. but if the
prisoner be committed for manslaughter or for felony generally, it seems the
escape will be felony, for the Jailer is not to judge what manner of felony it
is.

Stamf 35. k.
19. A man was taken for suspicion of felony, and was delivered to the Constable
of C. and after escaped for want of good keeping, and the Constable was
therefore taken and arraigned, and pleaded that for as much as the felon was not
taken with the manner, nor at the suite of the party, nor indicted of felony,
therefore it was no escape, etc. And so was the opinion of the Court then in
42. Ass. p. 5. Br. Escape 29. But the contrary was after holden although the
prisoner were taken only upon suspicion. 44. Ass. p. 12. Br. Escape 31. but
there it was holden to be but fineable.

3. Ed. 1. c. 4. P. Escape 2. Stamf. 35. c.
20. Note also where one is a prisoner by arrest only, and he does escape there
the escape shall be presented before the Just. of peace or other Justices
having authority to enquire of the escape, before he that suffered the escape
shall answer it.

21. Note also if a man be arrested for felony by the Constable or other
person, 1^. H. 7. 7. Cromp. 40. P. R. 151. 152.
and after they shall have intelligence that there is no such felony committed,
here they may set the party arrested at liberty again, and they shall not be
charged with the escape, for there can be no felon where there is no felony
committed.

44. Ass 12. Cromp. 40.
22. But if a man be slain, or that there be any other felony committed, and
one is arrested for the same felony, or for suspicion thereof, though he that
made the arrest, shall after have intelligence and certain knowledge that the
party arrested is not guilty of that offense, yet he or any other may not set
the party so arrested at liberty, for now he must not be delivered by any man's
discretion, but by course of Law, otherwise it will prove a voluntary escape,
and so felony, or at least fineable.

23. 25. Ed. 3. 39.
If a Justice of peace shall send for a felon out of the Jail and shall
deliver him without bail, this seems to be a voluntary escape, and so felony
in the Justice: Otherwise where the Justice erreth, pro defectu scientiae, as
to bail one that is not baileable, this is but a negligent escape.

Felonies by statute. CHAP. 23.
1. BUggery committed with mankind, Exodus 12.19. Levit. 18.23.
or beast is felony (without benefit of Clergy) it being a sin against God,
nature, and the Law.

2. Congregations and confederacies holden by Masons, 10. Caroli in Ireland ca.
20. P. Fell. 22. P. Felon. 19. 5. H. 4. ca. 5.
is felony in the causers thereof, and fineable in the Masons. 3. H. 6. ca. 1.

3. Cutting out of any the Kings subjects tongues, or putting out their Eyes of
malice is felony. 5. H. 4. ca. 5.

4. Conjuration, or Invocation of any evil spirrit, for any intent, 28. El.
ca. 3. in Ireland.
etc. or to be counselling or ayding thereto, is felony without benefit of
Clergy. See Exodus 22.18.

5. Also to use or practice Witchcraft, Enchantment, Charm, or Sorcery,
whereby any person shall be killed, or to be counselling, or ayding thereto is
felony without benefit of Clergy.

6. Also the second time to practice Witchcraft, etc. whereby any chattell, or
goods shall be destroyed or impaired, or whereby any person shall be hurt or
pined in his body, is felony without benefit of Clergy.

7. Now against these Witches the Justices of peace may not always expect
direct evidence, seeing all their works are the works of darkness and no
witnesses present with them to accuse them; And therefore for their better
discovery, I thought good here to insert certain observations out of the book
of discovery of the witches that were arraigned at Lancaster. Anno Dom. 1612.
before Sir James Altham, and Sir Edward Bromeley, Judges of Assise there, which
are these following, viz.

1. These witches have ordinarily a familiar or spirit which appears to them.

2. Their familiar has some bigg, or place, upon their body where he sucketh
them.

3. They have often pictures of Clay, or wax (like a man, etc.) found in their
house.

4. If the dead body bleed upon the witches touching it.

5. The testimony of the person hurt, upon his death.

6. The examination and confession of the children or servants of the Witch.

7. Their own voluntary confession, which exceeds all other Evidence.

8. H. 6. 12. P. Fell. 18.
8. Also the Embezeling of any Record or parcel thereof, writ, Return, Panell,
Process or warrant of Attorney in the Chancery, Exchequer, Kings Bench, Common
place, or Treasury (by reason whereof any Judgment shall be reversed) is
felony in the parties, their Counselors, procurers, or abettors.

2. R. 3. fo. 10. Co. 11. 34. See 8. R. 2. ca. 4.
9. So the rasing of such record is felony (within the said statute of 8. Hen.
6.) yet if a Judge do imbezell, or raze a Record, this is but misprision in
the Judge. 2. R. 3. Br. Coron. 174. and Treason. 31.

10. But it seems the Iu. of P. cannot enquire of, nor hear and determine
these two last sorts of felonies ( sc. imbezeling or rasing of records) for
that these felonies are committed to other Judges to deal with by the same
stat. of 8. H. 6. P. Records 4. but what is fit for the Justice of peace to do
herein; I have before in the chapter of felony declared.

11. Forestalling, or buying any foreign Marchandises before they come to the
Staple, etc. was made felony by the statute 27. Ed. 3. cap. 11. but by 2. R. 2.
ca. 2. it was repealed and made punishable again according to the statute of
25. E. 3. ca. 3. which is by 2. years imprisonment, or forfeiture of the value
of the thing forestalled.

12. Forging of evidences, sc. of any deed, Charter, obligation, Bill, P. Fell.
26. 28. El. ca. 4. in Ireland.
release, or other writing sealed, or of any Court Roll, or will, or of any
acquittance, or to cause or assent to be made any such forged writing, or
publishing any such writing knowing the same to be false: The second offense is
felony, without benefit of Clergy. But it seems also, that the Iu. of P. have
not to deal with this, for that they cannot well take notice of the former
conviction, See Cok. 9. 118. b.

P. Felon. 17. 14. E. 3. c. 9. 10.
13. If a Jailer (by duresse of imprisonment and pain) enforce his prisoner to
become an approver (that is an accuser of others as coadjutors with him in
felony) this is felony in such jailer. 14. E. 3. 10.

the same to the Sheriff of the same County to be proclaimed, etc. but does
imbezell the Hawke, it is felony.

P. hawks 2. vide.
15. So is it in him whosoever that takes up any Hawke and concealeth the same
from the owner, or his Faulconer, or that takes away any Hawke from the owner,
or steals any Hawke and carries it away not observing the foresaid ordinance.

16. H^nting of D^ere, or Conyes in any park, Forest, or warren unlawfully in
the night time, or with Visors, or other disguisings, if upon examination by a
Iu. of P. etc. the offender conceal the offense, Dyer. 50.
or any other offender therein, is felony in such concealor; But if such
offender upon his examination, shall confess the truth then he is but
fineable. And if any person, to be arrested for such offense shall disobey the
arrest: Or if any person shall make rescous, so that the warrant (of the Iu. of
P. etc.) for arresting them be not executed it is felony. But such hunting and
concealment, or resistance where the offenders killed no Dear, etc. seems
to be no felony, for all the presidents do run, occiderunt and
asportaverunt, etc. See Lambert. Cromp. and West.

17. Also it seems by the statute of 1. H. 7. ca. 7. that all such hunting
disguised, or any other unlawful hunting in the night time is felony, if the
offender be not examined thereof, and confess the same as abovesaid, See the
stat. 1. H. 7. c. 7. in fine.

18. If any person shall take a tame beast, 3. Ed. 1. 20. P. Fell. 24.
or other things in any park by manner of robbery, it is felony.

19. If any person being married, 10. Carol. ca. 21. in Ireland.
shall marry a second husband or wife, the first being alive, etc. it is
felony, except where the husband, or wife have been absent 7. years, and the
one not knowing the other to be living within that time, except also persons
divorced, etc. by sentence in the Ecclesiastical Court: And except persons
marrying within the age of consent.

20. Multiplication of gold, or silver, P. Fell. 21.
or to practice that Art is felony. 5. H. 4. ca. 4.

21. 10. Caroli ca. 19. in Ireland.
Poisoning sc. wilful killing of any person by poison is wilful murder in the
offenders, their Ayders, abetters, procurers, and Counselors. Co. 11. 31. But
the party poisoned must dye thereof within a year and a day after the poison
received.

of xij. d. without warrant or Commission under the great seal which warrant
they shall show to the parties, before they do take any thing from them: Or if
they shall buy or take any thing in other manner then is contained in their
warrant; Or shall take any carriage in other manner then is comprised in their
Commission. Or shall carry away any thing above the value of xij.d. and under
the value of 40.s. against the owners will without paying for the same
presently and according as they can agree with the seller in all these cases it
is felony, See the statutes 28. E. 3. ca. 12. 34. E. 3. ca. 3. 36. E. 3. ca. 5.

between Easter and Midsomer at small prises, or more than be sufficient for
the Kings ho^^^, and to carry them to his own house and sheare them. In every
of these cases it seems to be felony in such Purveyor their Deputies and
servants: And yet a purveyor, or taker, etc. may take victual, or other thing
according to his Commission at reasonable prices to the use of the Kings
Majesty, and according to the statutes, although it be against the will of the
owner. Br. Puru. 1.

Co. 8. 146.
24. But if a purveyor shall take any provision for the Kings house, by force of
his Commission; And shall after fell away the same, now his first taking is
become tortious, and he punishable as a Trespasser, if nor as a felon ab initio.

26. Robbing in the day time of any dwelling house, or of any out house, Co.
11. 36.
belonging and used to and with any dwelling house (as a Barn or stable, etc.)
if it be to the value of 5. s. or above (although no person be therein) or to
rob any house by day or by night, any person being therein, and thereby put in
fear, or to rob any person in any part of his dwelling place or house, 11. Ia.
ca. 3. in Ireland.
the owner or dweller, his wife, children, or servants therein, or in any other
place within the precinct of the same house or dwelling place (sleeping or
waking) or to rob any Booth, or Tent, in a fair, or Market, the owner his wife
children, or any servant being then within the same (sleeping or waking) every
of these offenses are now by stat. made felony and as penal as burglary by the
loss of the benefit of Clergy. See Co. 11. 31. 32. and 36. Stamf. 125.
But to break a house in the day time, although he has a felonious intent,
yet if he carries away nothing, this is no felony, for there must be an
actual felony done besides the breaking of the house in the day. And by the
report of Master Dallison, these statutes shall be straightly construed in
favor of life, and according to the bare letter, so that if the Robbery be
done by day, and there be in the house but one servant only, or there be in
the house, Booth, or Tent, but a stranger, or sojourner only, the fact shall
not be adjudged an offense against these statutes to take away the benefit of
Clergy.

27. If servants imbezell the goods of their deceased master or go away with
their masters goods, See antea in the chapter of Larceny, ca. 19. Sect. 15. and
23. where this shall be felony.

it is felony. See Co. 6. 27. that this statute of 18. H. 6. 19 is now of little
force; but yet the departure of a soldier without license is felony by the
statute 7. H. 7. 1. which statute is yet in force and perpetual. Co. ibid.

29. To ravish a woman, where she does neither consent before nor after, or to
ravish any woman with force, though she do consent after, it is felony, and
the offendour shall have no benefit of Clergy. 11. Ia. ca. 3. in Ireland.
Stamf. 22. Cromp. 100.
But a woman that is ravished ought presently to levy Huy and Cry, or to
complain thereof presently to some credible persons, as it seems. Glanvill
115. See the Stat. de officio Coronatoris. 4. E. 1.

30. Britton. 45. Stamf. 25.
If a woman at the time of the supposed Rape do conceive with child by the
ravisher, this is no Rape; for a woman cannot conceive with child, except she
do consent; 4. E. 4. 6. Br. Parliament 55.
But if a man ravish a woman, who consents for fear of death or dures, yet
this is ravishment against her will; for that consent ought to be voluntary
and free.

31. All such as are present, abetting, ayding, 11. H. 4. Stamf. 44.
or procuring another to commit rape, are principal felons.

32. It is a good plea, in an appeal of rape, Stamf. 24.
to say that before the ravishment supposed she was his concubine, as Master
Bracton says. And yet to ravish an harlot against her will, is felony, Cromp.
47.
for licet meretrix suerit ante, certe tunc temporis non fuit cum nequitiae
ejus reclamando consentire noluit. Bract. lib. 2.

33. Also to take away any Maid, 3. H. 7. 2. P. Fell. 16.
widow or wife (having lands or goods, or being heir apparent to her
Ancestor) against her will unlawfully, is felony, and to receive any so taken
knowing thereof, or to procure and abet the same, is felony. And shall be all
reputed as principals.

34. The taking away of a maid under 16 years of age without the consent of
her parents or governors, 10. Caroli ca. 17. in Ireland.
or contracting marriage with her, or deflowring her, is no felony, but yet
shall be punished with long imprisonment without bail or with grievous fine.

35. 13. Ass. 6. Br. Cor. 77. Stamf. 94. Cromp. 35.
Also to take away a man's wife with the goods of her husband, whether it be
against her will, or against her husbands will, seems to be felony, by the
stat. of West. 2. cap. 34. the words thereof are de mulieribus abductis cum
bonis virorum suorum, habeat rex sectam de bonis sic asportatis.

36. But if the wife take her husbands goods, F. Cor. 455. Stamf. 27.
and so goes away voluntarily with another man, and with those goods, or
delivers those goods to another man, these two last cases seem not to be
felony.

37. By a statute made in Ireland in the third year of the Reign of King
Edward the second, cap. 1. and 2. 3. Ed. 3. ca. 1. and 2.
Taking of meat or drink against the will of the owner is felony.

38. Also by a statute made in Ireland in the fifteenth year of the reign of
King Edward the fourth, Rot. Parliament. cap. 8. the taking of a distress
contrary to the common law, that is to say, where no distress lies in the
case, as to distrayne for debt, breach of Covenant or such like is felony; but
to distrayne where a distress lies in the case as for rent, service, or such
like, although the taking of the distress be unlawful, because no rent is
arreare, yet that is no felony; for that distress is not contrary to the
common law.

39. Also by a statute made in Ireland in the Eleventh year of the reign of
Queen Elizabeth. cap. 10. It is felony in a Searcher to conceal the
transporting of wool and other prohibited merchandises.

13. El. ca. 4. in Ireland.
40. By another statute made in Ireland in the thirteenth year of Queen
Elizabeth. ca. 4. it is ordained that the shipping, loading, imbarquing, and
putting into any ship, barque, Pickard, Boat, or any other vessel whatsoever
of any prohibited merchandises, as Wool, woolfels, etc. in any port, haven,
harbrow or Creek within this Realm before entry made of the same, and the
customs well and truly paid according the tenor and effect of another statute
made in 11. 11. El. ca. 10. in Ireland.
Eliz. ca. 10. shall be adjudged and deemed felony in all and every such
person and persons, their ayders, consorts, and assistants, that will so ship,
load, imbarque, and put the said goods into any Ship, Barque, Pickard, Boat,
or other vessel before entry made, and the said customs paid as aforesaid,
and that the same persons their ayders, consentours and assistants so to do
shall have the same order of process, inquiry, trial, judgment, forfeiture
and execution as in cases of felony is used by the common Law in this Realm,
and that the Justices of peace at their Sessions, and all and every officer and
officers within Cities and incorporated Towns, having authority to be
Justices of peace, or of jail deliverie, within the said Cities and
incorporated Towns shall and may lawfully inquire, hear and determine all and
singular the premises made felony by the said Act.

41. By a statute made in Ireland in Anno 10. H. 7. ca. 11. It is enacted that
if any person take any money or other amends for the death or murder of his
kinsman or friend other then the laws of the kingdom will permit the same,
10. H. 7. ca. 11.

age of 18. 33. H. 8. ca. 5. in Ireland.
years or upwards to go away with the goods of his master or mistress,
committed to his charge, if the goods be of the value of 40. s. but there is a
proviso, that this shall not extend to an Apprentice.

43. By a statute made in 10. Caroli ca. 20. in Ireland it is enacted that the
levying of any Fine, 10 Caroli c. 20. in Ireland.
suffering of any Recovery, acknowledging a Recognizance, bail, or Judgment
in the name of any other person or persons not being privy or consenting
thereunto shall be felony.

Accessaries. CHAP. 24.
3. H 7 fo 10. St^^f. ^0. Br. Treas. 19.
1. IN high treason, there be no Accessaries for all the advisers, counselors,
perswaders, and assistants therein, be principalls and as much as if they were
Actors or doers, yea all that shall advise, counsel, persuade, command,
procure, or hire another to do any treason, or felony, they being indeed the
very cause of the fact, may seem as culpable if not more, then the principal
Actor and the rule is, plus peccat author, quam actor, Examples also we have
hereof in the book of God. Genesis 3. The serpent the procurer of the first
sin, by Gods own Judgment had a greater punishment then the woman, or man;
Again, 2. Sam. 12.9. David is told (from God) that he had killed Vrias,
whereas he only commanded Ioab to kill him, etc. yet in case of felony our Law
is otherwise, for in felonies they are but accessaries and not principals.

2. Note whatsoever offense does make a man accessory in felony, Stamf. 40.
the like offense makes him principal in high treason.

3. But yet it seems this is to be understood of accessaries before the
Treason, for receiving, aiding, and comforting a Traitor after the offense
(knowing the same) was holden to be but misprision of treason. 12. and 13.
Eliz. Dyer 296. And yet by some other authorities, and by the common experience
and practice the relieving of Traitors after the offense, knowing thereof, is
holden to be treason, See 3. Dyer. 296.
H. 7. 10. Br. Treas. 19. per Hussy chief Justice and Cromp. 42. b.

4. In cases of Praemunire, there may be principal and accessory by some
opinions. 44. E. 3. and 8. H. 4. 6. b. Br. Praemunire 4. 6. Tamen quaere, 27. E.
3. ca. 1.
for these offenses seem more like a Trespass then a felony, etc. And upon
the statute of 27. E. 3. the offenders shall forfeite nothing, if they appear
at the first day, but if they appear not at the first day, then for their
contumacy they shall be out of the K. protection, and shall forfeite their
lands, and goods, to the K. which are as a pain given by the statute, but is
no attainder, also if the principal appear not, or happen to be dead, yet the
other shall answer, and therefore it seems that they be all principals. Br.
4.

5. In petty treason there is a principal, and there be accessaries, as there
is in felonies.

6. In felonies, there be two sorts of accessaries. The one is accessory before
the felony committed, the other is accessory after the offense done.

7. But he that is present at the time of the felony committed (be it in case
of murder, robbery, burglary, or Larceny) is principal, if he were either a
procurer, or mover, or be aider, comforter, or consenter thereto, although at
that present he do nothing. Plo. 100. a. 11. H. 4. Br. Coron 188.

8. If one being present at the killing, Stamf. 40. b.
or robbing of a man does nothing, yet would have aided his companion if there
had been need, he shall be adjudged a principal. F. Coro 395. Stamf. 37. 40. b.
But if one be present by chance and sees when another is slain, or robbed,
or when any other felony is committed, and does not come in company with the
felons, nor is of there confederacy, although he does not make any resistance,
Cromp. 44. 14. H. 7. 31.
or disturb the felon, or levy Huy, and Cry, nor discovers the same, but
concealeth it, yet it is no felony in him, but it is a great neglect of his
duty, for which he shall be punished by fine and Imprisonment.

9. Also in some cases a man may be a principal, although he be not present at
the time of the felony committed; As if A. knowing drink to be poisoned,
persuades B. to drink it, and after B. (in the absence of A.) does drink it,
and dies thereof. A. is here a principal murderer. Co. 4. 44.

Dalton page 259.
10. Note that the Accessory in felony, whether before, or after, though it be
another offense, and distinct from the principal fact, yet it is also felony.

Praecipiendo. Persuadendo. Consulendo. Consentiendo.
11. Accessaries, before the felony are such as shall will, command, hire,
procure, move, conspire, counsel, abet, or consent to commit any pety Treason,
murder, robbery, rape, burglary, or Larceny, but are not present thereat, yet
all such are thereby felons, when the felony is committed.

12. But here note, some differences are to be observed when the principal and
chief offender or Actor does not accomplish the fact altogether in the self
same sort, as it was before hand agreed and plotted between him and the
accessory, and therefore if A. command B. to lay hold upon C. and B. goes and
robs C. this is no felony in A. (if he be absent when the robbery is done)
for this commandment might have been performed without any robbery. But if
the commandment had been to beat C. and the party commanded does kill C. or
beats him so that he dies thereof. F. Coro. 314.
A. shall be accessory to this felony and murder, for it is hazard in beating a
man that he may dye thereof.

13. A. commands B. to rob one and in attempting this another is killed, Plo.
475.
A. shall be accessory to this murder, for he that commands an evil or
unlawful act to be done shall be adjudged accessory to all that shall ensue
upon the same evil Act, but not to any other distinct thing: As if A.
commands B. to steal a horse, and he steals an Ox, Plo. 475.
or to steal a white horse, and he steals a black, or to rob a man by the
high way of his money, and he robs him in his house of his place, or to burn
the house of B. and he burns the house of C. these be other Acts and felonies
than A. commanded to be done, and therefore A. shall not be adjudged accessory
to them.

14. But if B. shall commit the same felony which A. did command or counsel to
be done, though he does it at another time, or in another sort than A. did
command, Plo. 475.
or Counsel, yet here A. shall be accessory thereto; As if A. does counsel B.
to kill C. by poison, and he kills him with his dagger, or to kill C. by the
high way and he kills him in his house, or to kill him one day and he kills
him upon another day, in these and the like cases, A. shall be accessory to the
murder.

Dalton page 259.
15. A. counsels B. to poison C. and to that end A. buyeth poison, and
delivers it to B. who tempereth it in an Apple, and delivers it to C. with
intent to poison him and C. knowing nothing, gives the Apple to E. who eats
it, and dies thereof, here A. is not accessory to the murder of E. yet it is
murder in B.

16. A. counsels B. to kill C. and before he has killed him, Dalton page 26.
A. does repent ^im, and countermands it, charging B. not to kill C. and yet
after B. ^oth kill C. here A. shall not be adjudged accessory to the death of
C. for the Law adjudgeth no man accessory to a felony before the fact, but such
as continue that mind at the time that the same felony is done and executed;
But if A. counsels a woman to murder the child in her body, and after the
child is borne, Dyer. 180.
and then is murdered by the commandment of the woman, in the absence of A. yet
he is accessory by his counselling it before the birth, and not countermanding
it. Dyer. 186.

17. A man foreknoweth of a felony intended to be done, and does conceal it,
and so suffers it to be effected, this makes him no accessory to the felony,
except he consents thereto, 14. H. 7. 31.
but such concealment seems to be only misprision of felony and fineable:
And yet the rule is, Qui non prohibet, quod prohibere potest, consentit.

18. Note that in manslaughter, Co. 4. 44.
there can be no accessory before the fact, for manslaughter is upon a sudden
falling out.

19. Accessaries after the offense, After the fact.
are they who knowing that another has committed a felony, do feloniously
receive or harbor him, or relieve, assist, comfort, or aid him, Stamf. 41.
whether it be before the attainder of the felon, or after his attainder: As to
comfort or relieve a felon (before he is attainted) with money, meat, drink,
or lodging, knowing of the felony, makes one accessory, Stamf. 41.
So to lend him a horse to go his way withal: Or otherwise to be a means of
his escape.

20. But to relieve him being in prison makes not a man accessory. Also to
aid him by his good word, or suit, for his deliverance, or to send a letter
for his enlargement by bail, Br. Cor. 103.
or any other lawful way, this makes not a man accessory to the felony, but
to work his enlargement by escape or any other unlawful means, will make him
accessory.

21. To receive, harbor, Cromp. 42.
or relieve a felon which is upon bail with money or victual, breeds no
danger of being an accessory, because the felony in this case cannot be
concealed, nor the trial hindered by it.

22. If a felon gets his pardon such as shall receive or relieve him after,
shall not be accounted accessory. But to receive or relieve him before his
pardon obtained, is felony, See Plo. 476. yet upon this pardon such accessory
shall be discharged, if the pardon be pleaded before the felon be attainted.

23. If a felon be attainted, by verdict, confession, or by Vtlary, some boo^es
hold that to receive, harbor, or relieve such a one, F. Coro. 377. Stamf. 96.
Dyer. 355.
by any person dwelling in the same County where the felon is attainted, it
makes such receiver, or ayder an accessory to the felony although such
receiver, etc. did not know of the felony, because by the attainder of the
felon, he is a felon of record, whereof every person dwelling in the same
County, is to take notice, yet Master Bract. requires a more direct knowledge
in the parties to make them accessory, for albeit a record (and especially the
pronouncing of an utlary) be so notorious, that every man may easily come to
know the same, yet were it an overgreat extremity that every man should (upon
the peril of his own life) take certain knowledge thereof, which opinion of
Master Bracton Master Lambert also holds to be very reasonable, and for my
part I am of Master Bractons opinion. But a felon at^ain^ed (by verdict, F.
Cor. 377. Vide Stamf. 4^.
confession, or utlary) in one Cou^ty, and another does receive, or aid him in
another County, this makes such receiver, or ayder no accessory to the felony,
unless he did also know of the felony.

24. If a feme covert shall relieve, or receive and keep company with her
husband, F. Cor. ^83. Stamf. 26.
knowing him to be a felon, she is no accessory thereby, for a woman covert
cannot be accessory in felony to her husband, for she ought to relieve him,
and not to discover his Counsel, but if she relieveth another felon, she is
an a accessory.

25. A felon who fled to the house of his natural brother, and the brother
shut the foredoore against the pursuers, See. Stamf. 43. c. Dalton page 261.
and convayed the felon out of his house, at a back door, whereby he got to
the Church, this brother was adjudged an Accessory for it, for he was a means
of the escape.

Stamf. fo. 43. c. Coro^. Fitz. 427.
26. If a felon flies, and comes to his friends house, and his friend does
shut the door against him, and yet makes the pursuers believe that he is in
the house, whereupon he escapes, this makes the friend to be an Accessory.

27. A man has a felon in his house, and (knowing of the felony) suffers him
to go his way, 9. ^ 4. 1. Br Cor. 26. See Br. escape 43.
and so to escape, yet this is no felony, for that he had not arrested him of
the felony before, neither can such an escape make him an accessory, except he
were a means of the escape, but for his neglect he may be punished by fine
and imprisonment.

28. If one do rescue him that is arrested for felony, he is a principal
felon, 1. H. 7. 6. Stamf. 43. c.
and not an accessory, for this rescous is a new felony of it self, although
it depend upon the former.

Buyi^g stolen goods. 35. E. ^. 39.
29. Receiving or buying stolen goods, knowing they were stolen, makes not a
man accessory to the felony, unless he receives also (or aydeth) the felon
himself, as it is holden in some books, yet Master Crompton and Justice
Stamford make a quaere thereof, 9. H. 4. 41. Stamf. 43. b.
See Cromp. fol. 41. 42. 43. But herein there is a difference between a buyer
being a stranger to the felon, and who for valuable consideration shall buy
such goods, and a receiver or buyer, who is an adherent or companion to the
felon, or that by Covin shall receive or buy such goods, for clearly such
receiver as is last mentioned is an accessory, as appears by the preamble of
the statute of 10. Caroli ca. 19. in Ireland, and I do not see in reason but
that the former should also be accessory, for by the money which is given for
the stolen goods the felon is as much relieved in the one case, as in the
other, and the cases as I conceive in 27. ass. p. 69. and 25. E. 3. fo. 39.
remembered by Master Stamford, fo. 43. and 69. are not contrary, if they be
duly considered, for the reason of those books is, because the indictment or
appeal was but only for receiving the stolen goods without speaking of
relieving the felon, but if the Indictment had been for relieving the felon,
the buying of the goods, knowing them to be stolen, would have been good
Evidence to maintain the indictment. Cromp. 4^.


30. A man buyeth stolen goods for 5. s. which are worth 20. s. this makes the
buyer an accessory by the opinion of Master Crompton, fo. 43. for it may well
appear by the price, that the seller came not truly by them, and therefore it
is safe to lay hold of such sellers, as shall sell any thing at any great under
value.

31. Taking ag^ine stol^e goods. Br. Cor. 2^.
A man pursues and takes a felon that has stolen his goods and then takes
his goods again, and suffers the Theife to escape, he is no accessory
thereby by some opinions; for he may in initio agere civiliter, or
criminaliter, at his pleasure, as Master Bract. writes, Cromp. 37. 41. 42.
but Master Stamf. fo. 40. says, If he takes his goods again from the felon
to favor him, this is theft boot, (the punishment whereof in ancient time was
of life and member, but at this day by Master Stamford fol. 40. It is but
ransom and imprisonment. Cromp. 41. P.R. 131. Br. Cor 121. 42. Ass p. ^.
Dalton page 262.
) The like seems to be, if he takes his goods again from the felon, and then
favors him, and lets him go, but if the party robbed take money, etc. of
the thief to the end he shall favor him, or shall not give Evidence against
him, whereby the thief escapes, now he is an accessory to the felony of his
own goods, by good opinion, though some other seem to take this for theft
boot, and so to be punishable at this day only by ransom and imprisonment.

32. If the party robbed, or if he that shall have any goods stolen from him,
after complaint by him made of the felony (to a Justice of Peace, or to the
Constable) shall then take his goods again, and will not prosecute this matter
against the felon any further, but will suffer him to escape, after he was once
so charged, and perhaps arrested for the same, this makes him an accessory,
for that he did once agere criminaliter, by complaint made to the officer
against the felon, and in such case, the Justice of Peace shall do well either
to commit, or at least to bind over both the one and other to the next Goal
delivery.

33. But if upon Huy and Cry a man do arrest a thief that has stolen another
man's goods, 22. Ass. 62.
and do then take the goods from the felon, and so let him go, this makes
him an accessory to the felony and also a principal felon for the voluntary
escape.

34. Note, in all cases of an accessory after the fact, it is requisite that
the fact, Stamf. 287.
to which he is an accessory, be a felony at the very time in which he
becomes an accessory to it, For if A. gives a mortal wound to B. upon the
first of March, and C. knowing thereof receives, etc. A. 2. or 3. days
together, and lets him go, and after B. dies of the wound within the
year, yet this receipt, etc. makes C. no accessory, because the principal
fact was no felony at the time either of the receipt, or of the letting him go.

P. Trial. 2.
35. By the statute of 10. Caroli ca. 19. in Ireland, accessaries may be to a
felony done in another County, Stamf. 41. fo. 63. li.
whereas before that statute the common law laid no hold of such accessaries,
for that these in another County, upon the trial could not have conusance of
the principal offense, etc. But now by the said statute there shall be a
Certificate from the Custos Rotulorum of the County where the principal shall
be attainted or convicted.

Stamf. 44^
36. Note that if an offense be made felony by statute, although the same stat.
does not expressly make mention of procurors, counselors, abettors,
receivers, consentors, and aiders, etc. yet they shall be taken as accessaries
(within the compass of the same statute) even in the same manner, as if it
were felony at the common Law.

37. A man may be an accessory to an accessory, as if he shall receive, 26.
Ass. 52. F. Cor. 196.
relieve, or comfort him who is accessory to a felon knowing the same.

P. Appeal. ^. Co 4. 43. and 9. 117. 119. Plo. 98. 99.
38. Although the accessory shall be punished, and shall have judgment of life
and member, as well as the principal, which did the felony, yet the principal
ought first to be attainted (after verdict or after confession, or by Utlary)
before any judgment can be given against the accessory, and the acquittall of
the principal is the acquittall of the accessory, for ubi non est principalis,
non potest esse accessarius, but yet the accessory shall be attached, and
surely kept (and shall be committed by the Just. of Peace, etc.) until the
principal be attainted.

39. And if the principal be attainted, though erroniously, that shall not
avail the accessory, but he must answer, etc. Co. 9. 68. b. and 119

Co. 4. 43. 44. F. Cor. 166. and 378. Vide Br. Coro 70. 71. 80. 83. 86. 132.
40. If the principal dye before he be attainted, or if the principal be found
not guilty by verdict, or be found by verdict that he slew the other in his
own defense, or if after conviction, and before judgment, he has his
Clergy, or gets his pardon, the Accessarie in all these cases shall be
discharged, but it is not safe for the Justice of Peace to dischardge such an
accessory out of Sessions.

Cromp 34. b
41. A man kills another se defendendo, or by misadventure, and it is so found
upon his trial, the accessory shall be discharged; for that in these cases the
principal shall not have judgment of death. Et omne accessar. sequitur suum
principale. See Br. Forf. 13.

Certain rules concerning felonies. CHAP. 25.
1. IF a man commits felony in the time of one King, Rules concerning
felony. 1. E 6. Br. Cor. 178,
he may be charged and arraigned for it after, in the time of another King.

2. If a man do commit murder, steal goods, or do any other felony in one
County, and then flies into another County, 13. Ed. 4. 9.
and is taken there, and brought before a Justice of Peace, there he shall be
(by the Justice) imprisoned in the jail of the County, where he is taken, and
after shall be removed by the Kings writ into the jail of the County where he
committed the felony; but for those that do inform against such felons the
said Justice shall bind such Informers over to appear and to give Evidence
against such felons, at the next general jail delivery to be holden in that
County, where the trial of such murder, or felony shall be, whither also the
said Justice must certify such information taken by him.

3. If a man commits a robbery, or steals a horse, 4 H. 7. 5. ^4 H 8. Br.
Cor. 171. Co. 7. 2.
beast or other goods in one County, and does carry lead, or drive the goods
into another County, it is felony in every County whither he does carry, or
drive those goods, and the offender may be indicted, or appealed of felony, or
theft, and be arraigned and have his judgment in any of those Counties, but
the offender cannot be appealed, or indicted of robbery, but only in the County
where the robbery was done, for it is not robbery in any other County, for
Robbery must be done to the person of a man.

4. If a felon do steal another man's goods, 11. E. 4. 3. 4. H. 7. 5.
and after another steals the same from him, the owner of the goods may
charge the first, or second felon, at his choice.

5. P.R. 130.
Also if a man shall deliver cloth to a Tailor to make a garment, if the cloth
be stolen from the Tailor, the offender may be charged, and indicted for
stealing the same, either at the owners suite, or at the Tailors.

6. Also an indictment may be, Dyer. 99.
Quod bona and Catalla cujusdam hominis ignoti felonice cepit, and in such case
any man may both inform the Court and by their direction may prefer an
indictment against the felon and give Evidence to the Enquest therein. And so
if the owner be known, and will not charge the felon therewith, any other
person (especially after proclamation made in the Court, that if any will
inform for the King, Stamf. 163.
he shall be heard) may safely inform the Court, prefer an indictment, and
give in Evidence for the King against the felon, because it is for the K.
advantage to have the forfeiture of the felons goods, and in the two former
cases if the Iu. of P. shall hear of any person that can inform any material
thing against such a felon, or against any felon, the Iu. in his discretion may
send for him, take his information, and may bind him to give evidence against
such felon.

Dalton page 265.
7. Also if any robbery or Theft be committed, and the party robbed, or other
owner of the goods, will not charge the felon therewith, yet every Just. of P.
may cause such felon (or any person suspected for such felony) to be
apprehended and may examine them thereof, and also may send as well for the
party robbed, etc. as for all such other persons as can inform any thing
material concerning the said felony, and may take their informations upon
oath, and if upon such examination he shall find cause, the said Justice may
commit the offenders, and bind over the informers.

8. Note also (for the better prevention and apprehending of felons) that upon
all homicides, Huy, and Cry. 3. E 1. c. 9.
burglaries, robberies, and other felonies, and when men are put in great
danger, Huy and Cry shall be levied, P. Fell. 38. and Huy, and Cry, 1.
and every man shall I follow the Huy, and Cry, and whosoever does not, shall be
attached to appear before the Iu. of jail delivery, and any Iu. of P. may
bind them over by the Commission of the peace, 3. Ed. 1. c. 9.
yea upon any felony committed, all men generally shall be ready (at the
commandment of the Sheriff, or Constable and at the cry of the country) to
pursue and arrest felons, upon pain to be grievously fined.

13. Ed. 1. c. 1. 2. 28 E. 3. c. 11.
9. And such Huy, and Cry, and pursuit shall be made from town to Town, and
from Country to Country, and shall be made by horsemen, and footmen, and in
case of robbery, if none of the felons be taken within Forty days after the
felony committed, 11. Caroli c. 13. in Ireland.
then the whole hundred, where the robbery was done, shall answer for the
robbery done, See Br. de^. 104.
and the damages but yet the inhabitants of any other hundred wherein
negligence, fault, or defect of pursuit and fresh suite, shall happen to be,
shall answer and satisfy the one moitie and half of all and every such
sums of money and damages.

3. H. 7. c. 1. Co. 7. 6. b.
10. And if a man be slain in the day time, in a Town not walled, and the
murderer, or manslayer escape, the whole Town shall be amerced for this
escape; But if it be in a City, or Town walled, then if the murder, or
manslaughter were by day, or by night, they shall be amerced for the escape,
Fitz. Coron. 238. 293. and 302. Stamf. 33. l. 3. H. 7. 1. P. Coroners 13.

11. And if a man be slain in the day time, out of any Town; then the hundred
shall be charged therewith, and for the insufficiency of the hundred all the
County shall be charged, etc. Stamford 34. f. yet see Dyer. 210. b. that the
towneship shall be amerced for the escape, although the murder were committed
in the fields of the Town, or in a lane, etc. and the Just. of P. are to
inquire of such escapes, and to certify the same into the K. Bench. P.
Justices 19.

12. Also every man is a sufficient Bailiffe and officer to apprehend him that
is pursued by Huy and Cry, P.R. 156.
and if he be taken with the thing supposed to be stolen, though he neither be
of evil fame nor a stranger, yet every man may commit as well such suspected
person, as also such goods to the Town where they be apprehended to answer to
the King according to the Law: And the Constables of the Town are to carry
before some Justice of peace, as well such prisoners, as also the bringers, that
the Justice may take there Information against such prisoner, and may examine
and commit such offender or person so suspected.

13. Dalton page 266.
But if a man do levy Huy and Cry upon another without cause, both the one and
the other shall be attached, and carried before a Iu. of P. to answer it, as
disturbers of the peace, and to be bound to their good behavior.

14. Note also that the Kings officer may break open any man's house, to
apprehend any felon, 9. Ed. 4. 9. Co. 5. 92.
or any person that is suspected of felony being in the said house.

15. Watch.
And for the better detecting and apprehending of such offenders in great
Towns being walled, the gates are to be shut from the Sun setting until the
Sun rising; 13. ^. 1. 4. P. watch. 1. 2.
And no man shall be lodged in the Suburbs from nine of the Clock, until day,
unless his Host will answer for him: And in all other Towns watch shall be
kept from the Feast of the Ascension, until Michaelmas, 5. H. 7. 5. a.
from the Sun setting until the Sun rising; And if any stranger do pass by
them he shall be arrested until the morning, etc. Lamb. offic. of a Constable.
And for such arrests none shall be punished: And the Constables ought to see
these watches duly set, and kept, and to make presentment to the Iu. of P. at
their Sessions, of the defaults of watches, and of such as lodge strangers for
whom they will not answer, and the Iu. of P. at their Sessions shall punish
such as be found in default. P. Watch. 2. And every Iu. of P. may cause these
watches to be duly kept.

The forfeiture for Felony. CHAP. 26.
THe punishment of felony is fourefold, sc.

1. The offender shall lose his life, and be hanged between heaven, and earth,
as unworthy of either. Co. 4. 124.


2. He shall lose his blood, as well in regard of his Auncestry, as of his
posterity, for his blood is corrupted, so as he has neither Auncestor, heir,
nor posterity.

3. He shall forfeite his (fee simple) lands wherein the K. shall have Annum
diem and vastum, to the intent that the offenders wife and children shall be
cast out thereof, his houses razed, his trees rooted up, his meadows plowed
up, and all his land wasted and destroyed; And after the year, day and wast,
the lands shall go by Eschete to the chief Lord of the fee. But yet the Lord
may fine with the K. for all, and so have the land presently.

4. The offender shall forfeite and lose all his goods.

5. P. P^ero. 16. 17. ^. 2.
The K. shall have all the goods of felons which be condemned and which be
fugitive, wheresoever the said goods be found, sc. all their goods moveable and
unmovable, Co. li 4. 95. Co. 3. 3. 2. Br Cor. 317. 334. Dalton p. 267. 10. H 6
47. Stamford. fo. 188. Dyer. 30.
their Corn growing, and the profits of their Fee simple lands, during their
lives, and all their debts done to them by stat. recog. obligation, or simple
contract, and money due upon accounts, and the King, or he to whom the King
shall give such debt, shall have an action therefore in his own name, and yet
the King shall not pay such debts as the said felons did owe.

6. By the common Law, after a felon be found guilty before the Coroner, or
that it be found before the Coroner that he did fly for the felony, there the
Coroner, Sheriff, undersheriffe, or Escheator, etc. may (for the King) seize
the goods of the felon, and preise them by an Enquest, etc. before his
attainder, for by such thing found before the Coroner, the goods of the felon
are forfeited without further inquiry or trial of the felon, and yet the
officer may not in such case carry the felons goods away, but (after prisement
as aforesaid) must leave them in the custody of the felons neigbours, 22. Ass.
96. Br forf. 53. 43. E. 3. ^4.
where he dwelt, or in the custody of the Town where the goods were, to be
answered to the K. and if he were indicted of felony, yet his goods should not
be removed out of his house, until he were convicted, but the officer was to
seize, and preise them, and to take surety of the party that they should not be
imbezeled, and if the party would not find surety, than the officer was to
deliver them to the neighbors, and the said goods should be kept by his
neighbors all the time of his imprisonment, and the felon must have had
reasonable maintenance of his goods for him and his family until he were
convicted and found guilty of the felony, and then that which did remain was
the Kings, See 25. E. 3. c. 14. P. indict. 5.

P. Sherif. 24.
7. And now by the statute made 1. R. 3. c. 3. it is ordained, that if any
Sheriff, etc. or other person, do take or seize the goods of any person
arrested and imprisoned before the same person be convicted or attainted of
felony, or that the same goods be otherwise lawfully forfeited, 25. Ed. 3.
he shall pay to the party grieved the double value of the goods so taken or
seized, etc. which statute seems to be but a confirmation of the common Law,
P. indict. 5.
says Master Stamf. fo. 193. save that, it gives the party grieved a more
ample recompense, and more speedy remedy than the common Law before did, so
that before attainder or conviction the goods of a felon that is in prison
ought not to be seized, Stamf. 193.
nor committed to the Town, nor taken out of the felons house, or possession,
for a man attainted of felony shall forfeit such goods as he has at the time
of the attainder, and not at the time of the felony committed, and a felon or
traitor after the felony or Treason committed, Br forf. 58. Co ^ 1^1 Stamf.
192. a.
and before attainder or conviction may sell (bona fide) for his sustenance,
etc. his goods or chattells, be they real or p^rs^nall (but they may not
disorderly sell, or waist their goods) therefore it seems that the officer
may still take surety that the goods be not imbezeled, and for want of surety
may deliver them to the Town. See Br. Forf. 44.

8. Nay after attainder if they shall grant their goods or lands, it shall
bind all persons, except the King and Lord by escheat, but against them such
grant is void. And besides as to the King or Lord by escheate, a man attainted
of treason or felony is absolutely and perpetually disabled by the corruption
of his blood, so as none of his posterity can claim any inheritance in
Fee-simple as heir to him, or to any other Ancestor paramount him. Co. 11. 1.
b.

9. After the conviction of a felon (if the goods were in the felons possession
at the time of his conviction) the Town presently stands charged therewith and
shall answer for them, though the goods were never seized by the officer, nor
delivered to the Town (except they can show what other person has detained
those goods, and that they could never have possession of them, which exception
is by the statute of 31. E. 3. 3. P. Estreates 3. Stamf. 193. 194.
) So that it shall be safe for the Town to seize such goods (in whose hands
soever they be found) presently after the conviction of any felon, yet by the
opinion of Prisot, none may seize any goods for the King, but an officer who is
accomptable to the King. 9. H. 6. 1. but in this case the towneship is
accomptable, and therefore by Prisots reason they may seize such goods.

10. Co. 11. 30. 38.
Conviction in felony is where a man (being indicted of felony) upon his
arraignement submits himself to be tried by the Country, P.R. 179.
and then is found guilty by the verdict of twelve other Jurors; Or shall
confess the offense upon his trial, or is outlawed for the same. Co. 1^. 30.
Also conviction in all other offenses (by the common Law) is where the
offender is indicted, or the offense presented by a Jury whereto the offender
pleads Not guilty; and is found guilty, by the verdict of twelve other Jurors.

11. And yet by diverse statutes you shall find that an offender may be
convicted (out of Court) either upon the view and record of the Justice of
peace; Or by the confession of the offender, or upon examination of witnesses
before one or two Justices of peace, and that out of the Sessions.

12. And sometimes by confession or examination of witnesses in Court without
any verdict taken, See Crom. 130. 131. Br. Confess. 32. And in some cases
conviction shall be taken for attaineder, see Co. 11. 59. 60.

13. The difference between attainder, and conviction, Co. 11. 58. Stamf. 138.
and 185. b.
in case of felony is, the person attainted has judgment of death given upon
him; The person convict, before judgment, prays his Clergy and has it, etc.
Or after verdict, confession, or outlary, the felon is said to be convicted
till judgment be given.

14. And so a man is properly said to be indicted, when the offense is first
found by the great Enquest, or other Jury of Enquiry.

15. Convicted, when the offender is found guilty by a second Jury.

16. Attainted when (after such conviction) judgment is given against the
offender.

Examination of felons and Evidence against them. CHAP. 27.
1. When any person shall be brought before a Iu. of P. for Treason, 10.
Caroli c. 18. in Ireland.
murder, manslaughter, or any other felony (wherewith the Iu. of P. may deal)
or for suspicion thereof, before the Justice shall commit or send such offender
to prison he shall take

1. The examination of such offender in writing, but not upon oath.

2. The information of such as bring him viz. he shall take their examination
and information of the fact, and circumstances thereof upon oath; And so much
thereof as shall be material to prove the felony, he shall put in writing
within two days after the said examination.

3. Also the same Iu. of P. shall bind all such by recognisance as do declare
any thing material to prove the treason or felony, to appear at the next
general jail delivery (to be holden where the trial of the said felony shall
be) to give in evidence against such offenders.

4. And then the same Justice shall make his Mittimus to carry the offender to
the Jail.

10. Caroli c. 18. in Ireland.
5. Or if such offender be baileable (and that there be two Justices of P.
present together, the one of them being of the Quorum) after such examination,
and information taken, and put in writing, the said Iu. of peace may bail such
prisoner.

6. And the said Iu. or Justices of P. shall certify at the next general
jail delivery, such examination, information, recognisance, and bailement.

7. And if any Iu. of P. shall offend in any thing contrary to the true intent
and meaning of this statute the Justices of jail delivery in their discretions
shall fine every such Justice of peace.

8. And yet for petty Larcenies, and felonies, the offenders in the County of
Dublin may be tried at the quarter Sessions, and the examinations and
informations may be certified thither, and the Informers bound thither.

9. For the form of the recognisance, the form of the Mittimus, and the form
of the bailement. See postea in the title of warrants and presidents.

10. It the offender upon his examination before the Justices of P. shall
confess the matter, it shall not be amiss that the offender subscribes his
name, or mark, under such confession made by him.

11. If the offender confesses the felony before the Justice of peace and
notwithstanding he lets him go, without committing or bailing of him, this
seems to be a voluntary escape and so felony in the Justice, Cromp. 39. 44.

12. Also if any person shall be brought before a Justice of Peace, and charged
with any manner of homicide (other than that which shall be done in the orderly
execution of Judgment, as if it were done se defendendo, or by casualty (which
are not felonies of death, or done by an infant, a lunaticke, or the like, yet
it is the Justices part, and safest for him to commit the offendour to prison,
or at least to join with some other in the bailement of him (if the cause will
suffer it) to the end the party may be discharged by a lawful trial.

13. Children may be examined to prove a felony against their parents, and
bound to give Evidence; for the son, and daughter, of Elizab. Device a witch,
were not only examined by the Justice of Peace against their said mother, and
the said examinations certified, and openly read upon the arraignement and
trial; but the daughter also was commanded, and did give open Evidence against
her mother then prisoner at the Bar; And by the statute of 10. 10. Carol. ca.
19. in Ireland.
Caroli in Ireland, the Justices of peace are to bind by recognisance to give
Evidence, all such as do declare any thing material to prove the felony.

14. It appears in the book of the discovery of witches, By an Infant.
that two children, the one about 9. years of age, the other of 14. did upon
their oaths give Evidence against the prisoners upon their arraignement: And
likewise at an Assise at Down a murder was discovered, and the murderer
condemned upon the sole evidence of a child of about 10. years old, and the
murderer after she had received her judgment confessed the fact, with all the
circumstances according as the child had declared the same.

15. Two inform against another in matter of felony, By persons discredited.
and they vary in their tales ( viz. in the day and place, when and where the
felony was committed,) such information is not much to be credited. See the
story of Susanna.

16. He that is examined, Cromp. 100.
if part of that he speaks be proved to be false, Dalton page 271.
he is not much to be credited in the residue of his information, and therefore
we shall find in 16. Ed. 4. that, a man who was produced as a witness in the
Chancery, in his deposition was found to swear falsely in part, and thereupon
his testimony was utterly rejected.

17. A man attainted of perjurie, and after pardoned and restored, such a
persons information is not much to be credited against a prisoner, for the old
saying is, Once forsworn ever forlorn.

18. A man attainted of conspiracy or forgerie, shall not be received to give
Evidence, or to be a witness. See Cromp. 127. b.

19. But if one be brought before a Justice of Peace upon suspicion of felony,
although the information against the prisoner shall be by such witnesses, yet
it seems safest for the Justices of peace to take their information for the
King, and to bind them over to give Evidence, etc. and to commit the party
suspected: And upon the Trial to inform the Justice of Goal delivery
concerning the credit of those witnesses.

P. Restitut. 1.
20. And for that, men should be the readier and more willing to give evidence
against felons, 2^. H. 8. c. 10. in Ireland.
there is a statute made in Ireland whereby it is enacted that if any man has
any goods stolen from him, if the felon be thereof indicted, and after in any
sort attainted, or found guilty, by reason of evidence given by the party
robbed or owner of the said goods, or by any other by his procurement, then the
party robbed or owner of the goods shall be restored to the said goods, Stamf.
165. 169.
though he never made any fresh suit. Before which statute the party robbed
could have no restitution without suing of an Appeal against the felon and
fresh suit made. Restitution.


Co. 9. 80.
21. Also the executors of the party robbed shall have restitution, by force of
this statute, viz. upon evidence given by them, or by their procurement against
the felon, whereby the felon is attainted or found guilty.

22. If a thief do rob or steal goods from three men severally, and he be
indicted of the robbing or stealing from one of them, and arraigned thereupon,
in this case though the other two would give Evidence against the offender, yet
shall they not have restitution of their goods by the meaning of that statute,
for the felon is not attainted of any other felony, P.R. 162.
saving of that whereof he was indicted, but if he be indicted of all the three
Robberies, or felonies, severally, and arraigned upon one of them, and found
guilty by the evidence given by one of the parties robbed, etc. yet shall he be
after arraigned upon the other two Indictments, to the intent he may also be
found guilty by the Evidence of the other two persons robbed and that so they
may have restitution of their goods stolen, according to the meaning of the
said statute.

23. And if a man do steal goods at diverse times from several men, 44. Ed.
3. 44.
and he is after attainted at the suite of one of them only for the goods
stolen from him, but is not attainted at the suite of the others, by this
attainder the felon shall forfeite to the King, not only his own goods, but
also the goods stolen from those other at whose suite be was not attainted,
though the felon had no property but only a possession of those goods; And the
property of the goods which remains in the right owner in this case is
forfeited (by the owner) to the King for default of the owners pursuing the
felon.

See Stamf. 66.
24. Also if there be diverse of the Thieves, and but one of the principals
attainted (as before) yet the party robbed shall have restitution: But in these
and the like cases of restitution if the felon has sold the goods in a fair,
or market Overt, and after be attainted of the felony (upon evidence given by
the party robbed) here the owner shall not have restitution, for by alienation
in Fair, or market overt, the property of the goods stolen are altered, yet if
he that bought the goods in market ouert, were privy to the felony such sale
shall not alter the property, quia particeps criminis. See 33. H. 6. 7. Co. 3.
78. 3. and 4. Ph. and Ma. ca. 6. in Ireland.
But by a statute made in Ireland the party robbed shall have restitution out
of the felons goods if the property be altered or the goods stolen esloyned so
as they cannot be found.

25. A man shall have restitution of money stolen, though it cannot be known.
Br. Restit. 22.

26. But if a man has a horse or goods stolen from him and knows not by
whom, or if he knows the felon, yet if the felon waiveth the goods flies and
escapes, and the Lord of the Manor, etc. seiseth them, the party robbed shall
have no restitution, for that he cannot indite and attaint the felon, and yet
if the felon had not the goods in his possession, and with him at the time when
he fled (but had left them elsewhere) then are they not waived goods nor
forfeite, but that the owner may take them again wheresoever he finds them,
without any restitution awarded. Co. 5. 109.

27. Examinations taken by Iu. of P. in one County may be, Examination
certified.
by them certified into another County, and there read and given in Evidence
against the prisoner.

28. The offender himself shall not be examined upon oath, for by the common
Law, Nullus tenetur seipsum pr^dere.

29. But it seems convenient, in cases of felony and treason especially that
the Information (of the bringers and others) which the Iu. of P. do take
against the prisoner be upon oath; Upon oath.
Otherwise upon the trial of the prisoner such Information, or examination
taken by the I^stice of peace, shall not be read or delivered to the Jury, nor
given in Evidence against the prisoner upon his trial, and so was the
direction of Sir Edward Coke late Lord chief Justice (5. Iacobi, at Cambridge,
Summer Assizes) upon the trial of a felon: For said he, in case of Trespass
to the value of two pence, no Evidence shall be given to the Jury but upon
oath, much less where the life of a man is in question.

30. Also if the Informers be examined upon oath, then though it happen they
should dye before the prisoner have his Trial, yet may their Information be
given in Evidence, as a matter of good credit, And likewise it is found by
experience, that without oath many Informers will speak coldly against a felon
before the face of the Justice of peace, yea and will also speak very
sparingly and coldly upon their Evidence given before the Judges of Assise, as
I have observed in some, had they not been urged with their former Information
taken upon oath, for the laboring (by the offendour and his friends) to such
as are to inform and give Evidence (both before the matter comes before the
Justice of Peace and after) is now grown over-common and usual in Ireland,
especially, in cases of greatest moment, or where it concerns most notorious
malefactors.

31. Also Master Brook, (tit. Examination 32.) is of opinion that every
examination ought to be upon oath, Examination 32. Br.
and so also is the practice of the Justices of the higher Courts at Westminster. in
all their Examinations of Summoners, Viewers, Sheriffs, Clerks, and other
officers, etc.

32. And here let me admonish all such as are to inform or bear witness
against a prisoner, or any offendour, before a Justice of peace or other
Magistrate, that they be well advised, what they testify upon their oaths,
knowing that in such cases, if either they should not speak the truth, or
should conceal any part of the truth, they should offend against God, the
Magistrate, the innocent, the common wealth and their own souls, sc. against

God in despising of him, and belying the truth.

Against the Magistrate, in deceiving of him, and causing him to do Injustice.

Against the Innocent, in spoiling him of his Name, goods, or life.

Against the Common wealth, if the party be nocent or guilty, and he cleares
him by false witness.

And against his own soul, for it is perjury in him, (at least, in the
presence of God and good men.)

Whether Information, Evidence, or proof of witnesses shall be taken against
the King. CHAP. 28.
1. IT seems just and right that the Justice of Peace, who takes information
against a felon, or person suspected of felony should take and certify as well
such information, proof and evidence, as goes to the acquittall or clearing
of the prisoner, as such as makes for the King, and against the prisoner, for
such information, evidence, or proof taken, and the certifying thereof by the
Justice of peace is only to inform the King and his Iu. of jail delivery of
the truth of the matter, and such was the opinion of Sir Edward Coke, at Lent
Assizes at Bury. Dalton page 274.
5. Iac. as Master Dalton reports, but the Justices of peace, or Coroner may
not take such information, evidence, or proof, as makes against the King upon
oath for that is not warranted by the statute of 10. Caroli ca. 18.

2. Upon trial of felons before the Justice of jail delivery the said Iu.
will often hear witnesses and evidence, which goes to the clearing and
acquittall of the prisoner, yet they will not take it upon oath, but do leave
such testimony and evidence to the Jury to give credit, or to think thereof as
they shall see and find cause.

3. Popham chief Justice (at Cambridge Assizes tempore Eli.) committed one to
prison who upon the trial of a felon called out, that he could give Evidence
for the Queen, and when he was sworn he gave Evidence to acquit the offender.

4. In 7. H. 4. we shall find that one of the Sergeants, Stamf. 141. b.
as amicus Curiae, Co. 4. 19.
and to inform the Court (that they should not err) did show his opinion to
the benefit of a prisoner upon the insufficiency of the Indictment.

5. Now upon the examination of felons, Causes of suspicion.
and other like offenders these circumstances following are to be considered:
1. His name, scil. if he be not called by diverse names.
2. Quality, 1. His parents, if they were wicked and given to the same kind of
fault. 2. His ability of body, sc. if strong and swift, or weak or sickly, not
likely to do the Act. 3. His nature, of civil or hasty, witty and subtle, a
quarreller, pilferer, or bloody minded, etc. 4. His means, if he has whereon
to live, or not. 5. His trade, for if a man lives idly or vagrant (nullam
exercens artem nec laborem) it is a good cause to arrest him upon suspicion, if
there have been any felony committed. 7. Ed. 4. 20. 6. His Company, if
Ruffians, suspected persons, or his being in company with any the offenders. 7.
His course of life, sc. if a common Alchouse-hanter, or riotous in diet, play
or apparel. 8. Whether he be of evil fame, or report. 9. Whether he has
committed the like offense before, or if he has had a pardon, or been
acquitted for felony before, Nam qui semel est malus semper presumitur esse
malus in eodem genere mali.
3. Marks or Signs. 1. If he has any blood about him. 2. If any of the goods
stolen be in his possession. 3. The change of his countenance, his blushing,
looking downe-wards, silence, trembling. 4. His answers, doubtful, or
repugnant. 5. If he offered agreement or composition. 6. The measure of his
foot, or horse foot. 7. The bleeding of the dead body in his presence. 8. If
being charged with the felony or called thief, he says nothing. F. Cor. 24.
9. If he fled, Fatetur facinus, qui judicium fugit.
4. The fact 1. Place, sc. if convenient for such Act, as in a house in a wood,
Dale, etc. 2. Time, the year, day, and hour, early or late. 3. Where the
offendour was at the time of the fact, and where the day or night before, his
business, and company there, and witness to prove all these. 4. Manner: if
willingly by chance, or necessity.
5. The cause 1. If former malice. 2. If to his benefit, or what hope of gain.
3. If for the eschewing of any hurt or danger.
6. The persons, Agens, if principal, or Accessory, Enfant, Lunatique, etc.
Patiens, if against the King, common wealth, Magistrate, master, etc.



F. Cor. 211.
6. A felon brought before a Justice of Peace, accuses others, it is sufficient
cause for the Justice to grant out his warrant for the rest.

7. A man going to execution, accuses another of felony, it is sufficient
cause to arrest him.

8. Communis vox and fama, that he did the offense, is sufficient cause of
suspicion, Fama. Br. Faux. Impris 16.
sc. where such a felony is done, otherwise not.

9. But yet for the better conceiving what may breed, or give just cause of
suspicion, mark some of Master Bractons rules:

Stamf. 97.
1. For says he, Oritur suspitio ex fama, fama vero quae suspitionem inducit
oriri debet apud bonos and graves (non quidem malevolos and maledicos, sed
providas and fide dignas personas idque non semel, sed saepius: vanae autem
voces populi non sunt audiendae. And therefore where the common proverb is,
Vox populi est vox Dei, it should be, Vox populi Dei, est vox Dei.

2. Si furtum in manu alicujus inveniatur, vel sub potestate alicujus, tunc
ille in cujus domo vel potestate res furtiva inventa fuerit tenebitur, Stamf.
29.
(nisi warrantum invenerit, qui cum inde defendere possit) for as another
says, Cum adsunt testimonia rerum, quid opus est verbis?

Stamf. 179.
3. Si quis noctu cubaverit, in domo solus cum aliquo qui interfectus sit, vel
si duo aut plures ibi fuere and hutesium non levaverit, nec plagam a latronibus
vel interfectoribus in defensione facienda accipere, nec ostendunt quis de se
vel de aliis hominem interfecerit, his casibus mortem dedicere non possunt.

4. Si quis in domum suam notum vel ignotum acceperit, qui unius ingredit visus
est, Ibid.
vero postea nunquam nisi mortuus, dominus domus si tunc domisit, vel alii de
familia qui tunc interfuerunt, poenam capitalem subibunt nisi forte per patriam
fuerint liberati.

Stamf. 97. and 179.
5. Sunt etiam quaedam presumptiones ita violentae, ut probationem non admittunt
in contrarium, ut si quis cum cultello cruentato captus sit super mortuum vel
fugiendo a mortuo, vel mortem confitetur quibus casibus non admittitur mortem
dedicere, nec alia opus est probatione.

10. And yet in cases of felony, Co. 11. 30. 2. Vide.
etc. the confession of the offender upon his examination before the Justice of
peace shall be no conviction of the offender, except he shall after confess
the same again upon his trial, or arraignement, or be found guilty by verdict
of 12. men, etc.

11. Also in cases of secret murders, and in cases of poisoning, witchcraft,
and the like secret offenses, where open and evident proofs are seldom to be
had, there it seems half proofs are to be allowed, and are good causes of
suspicion.

12. Note by the common Law, 8 E. 4. 4. 5. H. 7. 4. Br. Faux. imp. 4. 16.
that in an action of false imprisonment brought against the Constable, or
other person that shall a^rest another upon suspicion of felony, it is no plea
for them to say that the plainetiffe was suspected of felony, but he must
allege that there was such a felony committed, and that the plainetiffe was
suspected for the same, for suspicion only without a felony committed, is no
cause to arrest another.

13. Also the defendant must allege some special matter in fact, 17. E. 4. 5.
21. H. 7. 29.
to prove that he who is arrested, was suspected of felony (as to say) that the
parry arrested, is a man of evil fame, etc. otherwise every man may arrest one
another without cause.

14. Also by the opinions of Keble, Vavisor, and Townsend, 7. E. 4. 10. Br.
Faux. imp. 16. 25.
as well the Constable as others in his aid, may arrest one that is suspected
of felony upon the suspicion and complaint (made to the Constable) of the party
robbed. 2. H. 7. 15. 16. Br. Faux. Impris. 14. 2. H. 7. 15. and 16.
And although others there be of opinion that the suspicion can extend to none
other, but only to him that has the suspicion, yet I conceive the opinion of
Keble, Vavisor, and Townsend, to be good Law, for if felons may not be
arrested, or stayed, but only by those that shall suspect them, and that others
may not aid and assist the party, that shall suspect another to have robbed
him, many felons shall escape and go unpunished to the exceeding great
prejudice of the common wealth.

15. But now by the statute of 10. Caroli in Ireland. The constable, etc. in
the former cases, 10. Caroli c. 16. in Ireland.
may plead the general issue (not guilty) and give the said special matters
in Evidence.

16. Also if the Constable, or other person shall arrest another upon suspicion
of felony by virtue of a warrant from a Just. of P. such warrant shall excuse
him, it being given in Evidence.

Forceible Entry and Forceible Detainer. CHAP. 29.
1. Cromp. 67.
THe common Law (being the preserver of the common peace of the land) has
always abhorred force as the capital enemy thereto. Co. 3. 12. And yet,
before the Reign of King Richard the second, the common Law seemed to permit
any man to have entered into lands and tenements with force and arms, and also
to have kept and detained them with force, where his Entry was lawful.

2. And at this day, if a man does enter with force (or multitude of people)
where his entry is lawful, he is not punishable by action either at the
common Law, nor (by action) upon any statute, for where the title of the
plainetiffe is not good, there he has no cause of action, 15 H. 7. 15. Br.
Force 11.
although the defendant does enter with force, but in such case he that enters
with force must be indicted upon the statute of 8. H. 6. or otherwise complaint
may be made thereof to the Justices of peace, and as well upon such indictment,
as upon such complaint, the offender shall be punished, but the party (ousted)
shall not be restored without indictment.

5. R. 1. ca. 7. Regist. 182.
3. And for the better restraining of such force, and forceible Entries, and to
inflict condign punishment upon the offenders therein, it was first ordained
by the statute. 5. R. 2. that no man should enter into any lands, or Tenements,
with force, or multitude (though he had good right, or title to enter) but only
in peaceable and lawful manner.

4. But this statute provided no speedy remedy, nor extended to holding with
force, 15. R. 2. ca. 2.
nor gave any special power therein to the Justices of peace, and therefore by
a statute made 15. R. 2. it was further provided, that if any man should
detain, or hold with force after such forceible Entry made, upon complaint
thereof he should be imprisoned by the Justices of peace.

5. Yet neither of the former statutes extended to those that entered peaceably,
^. H. 6. ca. 9.
and then held with force, and therefore by the statute. 8. H. 6. it was and is
provided that no man shall enter with force, nor detain (or hold) with force
(generally.)

6. Now these two last statutes. 15. R. 2. and 8. H. 6. do enable any one
Justice of peace, to give present remedy, viz. to remove the force, and commit
the offenders in cases of forceible Entry, or holding against the aforesaid
statutes.

7. Also the statute of 8. H. 6. extends further, reaching the offenders, if
they were removed before the coming of the Justices, giving the Enquiry and
restitution, and also punishing the Sheriff that shall not obey the precepts
of the Just. in this behalf.

One Justice.
8. Every Justice of peace, upon complaint to him made, or upon other notice to
him given, 15. R. 2. ca. 2.
of any forceible Entry into, or holding, or detainer of possession of any
lands, tenements, or other possessions, or of any benefices, ^ H. 6. ca. 9. P.
1.
or offices of the church contrary to these statutes, without any examining,
questioning, or standing upon the right, or title of either party, ought in
convenient time, at the costs of the party grieved to do execution of these
statutes in manner and form following.

9. 15. R. 2. ca. 2.
First he ought to go to the place where such force shall be and he may take
with him sufficient power of the County, or Town, by his discretion, and the
Sheriff also, if need be, to aid him, for the better execution of this
business, sc. as well for the arresting of such offenders, as also for the
removing of the force, and for the convaying of them to the next jail.

10. He ought to arrest, and remove all such offenders as at his coming he
shall see, or find, touching the force. Arrest.
And may take away their weapons, harness, and Armor, and presently cause
them to be preised, and afterward to be answered to the King, as forfeited, or
the value thereof.

11. If the doors be shut, and they within the house shall deny the Justice to
enter, he may break open the house to remove the force.

12. But if such offenders being in the house, at the coming of the Justice,
shall make no resistance, nor make show of any force, then the Justice cannot
arrest, or remove them, except upon the enquiry, a force be found, See Cromp.
37.

13. Also if the house or land which is holden with force shall extend into two
Counties, Cromp. 71.
and the offenders remove their force into that part of the house or land,
which is in the other County when the Justices do come, they cannot then
remove the force.

14. And if the Justice at his coming shall see or find a force, and shall
remove the offenders, yet he may not upon his own view, restore the party
ousted, to his possession again without enquiry first made of the force by a
Jury.

15. Record. 14. H. 7. 8. Co. 8. 121.
Also the Justice ought to make a Record of such force by him viewed, which
Record shall be a sufficient conviction of the offenders, and the parties shall
not be allowed to travers it.

16. 163. and 375.
And this record (being made out of the Sessions by a particular Justice) the
said Justice may keep it by him, or he may make it indented, and certify the
one part into the Kings Bench, or leave it with the Clerk of the peace, and
the other part he may keep himself.

17. The form of the record you shall find hereafter in the Title of warrants
and presidents.

18. Imprison. 21. H. 6. 5. Br. Peace 4.
Also he ought to commit (immediately) to the next jail all such persons as he
shall find and see, continuing the force at his coming to the place, there to
remain convict by his own view, testimony, and record, until they have paid
a Fine to the King; Co. 8. 12^. P. 2.
For this sight and view of the force by the Justice (being a Judge of Record)
makes his record thereof (in the Judgment of Law) as strong and effectual,
as if the offenders had confessed the force before him, and touching the
restraining of a traverse more effectual then if the force had been found by
a Jury upon the Evidence of others.

19. And yet the words of the statute seem more large, sc. And if he do find
any that made any such forceible Entry or that hold the place with force,
Cromp. 1^5.
etc. he shall commit the offenders to the jail, etc. But such force must be
in the presence, or view of the Justice of peace, or else he can neither record
it, nor yet commit the offenders. 13. H. 7. Crook 41.

20. The form of the Mittimus you may see afterward in the Title of warrants
and presidents.

21. Also the same Justice of peace, or some of them that shall see the force
(as having best knowledge of the matter and of the quality of the offense,
Fine. Co. 8. 41. a. 557.
and having the custody of this record (are the proper Judges over this
offense; And therefore may assesse the fine upon every such offender, and
commit him until he make payment thereof: But the fine must be imposed upon
every offender severally and not upon them jointly. Co. 11. 43. 3.
And the Justice ought to estreate the same Fine, and committall, and to send
the estreate immediately into the Eschequer, that there the Sheriff may be
charged with the said Fine upon his account.

22. Also upon payment of the said Fine the said Justice may deliver the
offenders out of prison again by some opinions, Br. Imp. 100.
but the safest way for the Justice of peace is to estreate the Fine and
committall into the Eschequer and leave the further proceeding therein to that
Court.

23. Or the Justice of peace, by some opinions, may record such force and
commit the offenders, and after certify the record to the Justices of Assise,
Cromp. 161.
and jail delivery (as it was done at Stafford Assizes, Anno 26. Eliz. by the
report of Master Crompton) or else to certify it to the general Sessions of
the peace, (as it seems to Master Crompton) and there the offenders may be
fined: For says he, the statute does not say, that the Fine shall be assessed
by them that record the force, more than by other Justices.

24. Or rather the Justice of peace may certify, or deliver the record by him
made, and refer the fine, and further proceedings therein to the K. Bench, in
regard of their supreme authority in such cases. And this Master Lambert
thinks to be the safest course.

Inquiry.
25. Also the Justice of peace notwithstanding his own view of the force, may
and ought in some good town and place near where the force was, to enquire by
a sufficient Jury of the same County to be returned by the Sheriff, as well of
those which made such forceible Entry, as of those which made such forceible
deteyner.

26. And here note that any one Justice of peace alone out of the Sessions may
make an Enquiry (being so appointed by the statute) whereas otherwise there
must be two Justices at the least, to make an inquiry, or to hold a Sessions,
and one of them of the Quorum.

27. And this enquiry ought to be made whether the offenders be present, or
gone, at the coming of the Justice of peace, yea this enquiry the Justice must
make, though he go not to see the place, where the force is, for without this
enquiry, there can be no restitution.

28. The form of a precept to the Sheriff, to return a Jury, and the form
of the Enquiry, Presentment, or verdict, you shall find in the Title of
warrants and presidents.

29. And if upon such Enquiry, Restitution.
such forceible Entry (or forceible holding, or deteiner) shall be found by
the Oaths of the Enquirors, then the said Justice of peace shall reseise the
lands and tenements so entered upon, or holden, and thereof put the party in
possession again, which in such sort was put, or holden out.

30. But as well the putting out as also the holding out must of necessity be
found and that by express words in the Indictment.

31. And this restitution, the Justice of peace may make himself; Or he may
make his warrant to the Sheriff to do it: Or else he may certify such
presentment, or indictment taken before him, into the Kings Bench, and so leave
the restitution to be awarded, out of that Court.

32. But the Justices of Assise and jail delivery, nor Justices of peace at
their general Sessions, cannot, as it seems, make or award restitution,
except the Indictment were found before them, but the Justices of peace only or
some of them that were present at the enquiry, Co. 9. 11^.
and when the indictment was found (they only) have power to make restitution,
except the Justices of the Kings Bench who have a supreme authority in all
cases of the Crown.

33. And therefore if the record, sc. the presentment of such force shall be
certified by the Justice of peace into the Kings Bench; Or that the same
prefentment or indictment shall be removed thither by Certiorari there the
Justice of the Kings Bench may award a writ of Restitution to the Sheriff of
the same County to restore possession to the party so expelled.

34. After it shall be found by such Enquiry, P.R. 14. b.
that such forceible entry, or deteiner is made, the Justice of peace may
break open the house by force, to reseise the same, and to put the party so
put out in possession again: And so may the Sheriff do, having the Justice
warrant.

35. The form of such warrant from the Justice of peace to the Sheriff to
make restitution you may see in the Title of warrants and presidents.

36. But the Justice of peace may not, in any wise make restitution without
such inquiry first had, and such force thereby found; And if the Justice shall
make restitution without inquiry, it seems to be punishable in the
Starchamber.

37. Also this restitution ought to be made to none but to him only that was
put out, so that if the Father be put out by force and dies (after inquiry and
before restitution) his heir shall not have restitution.

38. Also such restitution must be made, only where a man is put out, or holden
out, etc. of house, or land, and is not to be understood of a Rent Common,
Advowson, or such like.

39. Also the Justice may make restitution, notwithstanding any offer of
Traverse, but yet upon Traverse tendered the safest way (for the Justice of
peace) seems to be, for him to deliver, or certify the presentment into the
Kings Bench, and so to refer the further proceedings therein to them.

40. And although these statutes do inflict no penalty upon the Justice of
peace if they shall not execute these statutes, yet (if upon complaint or other
notice to them given of such force) they shall not at least remove the force,
record it, and commit the offenders, they are punishable in the Starchamber.

41. Although the Justice of peace ought to commit to the jail and may fine
all such as he shall see continuing the force at his coming to the place, yet
upon a force found by the inquiry only, and not viewed and seen by the
Justice, he may neither fine, nor send to the jail the said offenders (by the
statute of 8. H. 6. which appoints the inquiry) for the Justice has power by
the said statute to make restitution only as says Master Lambert, Cromp. 161.
b.
yet Master Crompton holds the contrary; But howsoever the Just. of P. is to
remove, the offenders that be present, that so he may restore the other, and
may bind the offenders to their good behavior, and if the offenders be gone,
yet the Justice may make his warrant to take the offenders, and may after send
them to the Jail, until they have found sureties for their good behavior.

13. H. 4. ca. 7.
42. Note that if such forceible Entry, or detainer, shall be made by three
persons, Cromp. 68. b.
or more, then is it also a Riot, and then (if there be no former enquiry
thereof made) the two next Justices of peace upon notice ought to inquire
thereof (as of a Riot) by a Jury within one month, upon pain to either of
them making default to forfeite 100. l.

Defaults of Sheriffs.
43. Also one Justice of peace may, as it semmeth hear and determine the
defaults of Sheriffs and Bailiffes, in not returning sufficient Jurors
(whereof every one shall have lands, 8. H. 6. 9. P. Just 89. Rast. 174. c.
etc. to the value of Forty shillings by the year at the least) before him, to
inquire of such forceible Entry, or deteiner, and the said Justice of peace
may proceed therein as well by bill, at the suite of the party grieved for
himself, as also by indictment only for the King: And the same process shall
be made against such persons indicted or sued by Bill in this behalf, as
should be made against persons indicted, or sued by writ of Trespass with
force and Arms against the Kings peace.

44. And though any one Justice of peace may proceed in every of these former
cases of forceible Entry, or deteiner, as aforesaid, yet if two or more
Justices shall join therein together, it is the better, for plus vident oculi,
quam oculus, and securius expediuntur negotia pluribus ^^^missa. Co. 4. 46.

(...)
45. Also the Mayors, and Justices of Peace, and the Sheriffs, and Bailiffes of
Cities and Burroughes having Franchise, 8. H. 8. 9. Rast. 174. d.
have in the said Cities, towns and Burroughes like authority to inquire of
such Entries, or putting out, and in other the Articles aforesaid, rising
within the same, as the Just. of Peace and Sheriffs in Counties and Shires
have.

46. The stat. of Northampt.
Also every Justice of Peace to whom a writ upon the statute of North-hampton
(concerning the removing of a force) shall be delivered, ought to execute the
same writ, sc. he ought to remove the force, and to certify his doings
therein into the Chancerie. 1. Ed. 3. 3.


47. And for that the Justices of peace, to whom this writ shall be delivered,
is herein but a minister, and is to certify that which he shall do therein, I
will here set down the manner how he shall proceed to execute this writ:

1. When the Justice of Peace shall come to the place where the force is
supposed by this writ, he may cause three Oyes for silence to be made, and then
he may make Proclamation in the Kings name to this effect. The Kings Majesty's
Justice of Peace straightly charge and in his Majesty's name commands all
and every person to keep silence, whilst his Majesty's writ, etc. be read, and
proclamation be thereupon made accordingly.

2. Then may he read, or cause to be read, the writ, or may declare the effect
thereof.

3. Then let three other Oyes be made, And thereupon make proclamation again
as follows:

His Majesty's said Justice does in his Highness name and by virtue of his
Majesty's writ, straightly charge and command that no manner of person of what
estate, degree, or condition soever, now being within the house of B. etc.
(named in the said writ) shall go armed or keep force of armor, or weapon,
nor do any thing there, or elsewhere, in disturbance of his Majesty's peace,
or in offense of the stat. made at North-hampton, in the 2. year of King E. 3.
upon pain of loosing his said armor and weapons, and of imprisoning his body
at his Majesty's pleasure.

God save the King.

4. Then the Just. of P. may enter, and search whether there be any force of
Armor, or weapon worn or borne, against this proclamation, or otherwise, he
may inquire thereof by a Jury, for so the writ it self does warrant him; And
if after proclamation any such be found, he ought to imprison the offenders,
and to seize to the K. use and preise (by the oaths of some present) the
armor and weapons so found with them, and the offenders so imprisoned are to
remain in prison until that some other commandment be given concerning them
from his Majesty, viz. by writ out of the Chancerie.

5. But if upon the Proclamation made they do depart in peaceable manner, then
has the Just. no warrant by the writ to commit them to prison, nor to take
away their Armor.

6. But when the Justice has removed the force (upon his writ) he may not put
the party that was put out, Cromp. 74. 162.
in possession again, for if he do, it seems both the Justice, and the
party also are punishable in the Starchamber, for the writ does authorish the
Justice only to remove the force, and not to make restitution.

48. The form of this writ upon the statute of North-hampton you may see in
Fitz. N.B. 249.

Without writ.
49. The form of the certificate, or return into the Chancery of this writ,
you may see after in the Title of warrants and presidents.

2. Ed. 3. 3. P. Armor. 1.
50. Also every Justice of peace (ex officio) and without any writ may do
execution of this statute of North-hampton, and that as well by force of the
commission, as also of the said statute.

51. The manner to execute this statute, by the Justice of peace (ex officio)
seems to be all one, as before, where he has a writ delivered him, saving
that when he does this ex officio and without writ, he needs not to make any
proclamation, nor to send any certificate into the Chancery. But the Justice
may go to the place where the force is, and if it be in a house may enter, and
search if any force of Armor, or weapon be worn and borne against this
statute. And if any such offenders be found, he may commit them to prison and
may seize and preise the Armor and weapon so found with them, and he ought to
record all that which he shall do in this behalf and the same to Estreate
into the Exchequer that the King may be answered of the Armor, or of the value
thereof.

52. But here again the Justice must not make any restitution of the
possession to the party ousted but must only remove the force.

53. And concerning the offenders so found, and committed by the said Justice
of peace, Cromp. 160.
it seems the Justice at his discretion may fine them, and upon payment
thereof, may deliver the offenders, even as in the former statutes of 15. R. 2.
and 8. H. 6. Or else the said Justice may record such force, and commit the
offenders and after certify the record into the Kings Bench or to the Justices
of jail delivery, or to the general Sessions of the peace, but if he commit
and fine the offenders he must Estreate the same into the Exchequer.

54. So that these statutes do now give full remedy, and do prohibit, and are
made against these three degrees or sorts of force, viz. against

Fitz. 248. c.
1. Such as enter peaceably, and then hold forceibly.

2. Such as enter with force, and then hold peaceably.

3. Such as do both enter forceibly, and hold forceibly.

55. Now it is requisite to show how the Justice of peace shall demean himself
in the execution of these statutes; I will therefore proceed to give him some
further light in these seven particulars following:

1. First what is a forceible Entry, and what is a forceible holding within
the meaning of these statutes.

2. Who may commit a forceible Entry, etc. and upon whom.

3. Where a force or forceible holding is justifieable or lawful.

4. What, and how many several remedies the party has that is so put, or kept
out of his possessions.

5. The manner of proceeding of the Justice of peace by Enquiry.

6. Of restitution to be made to the party so put out, by whom and to whom.

7. What causes there may be for staying the Justice of peace from making
restitution.

What is a forceible Entry or holding within these statutes. CHAP. 30.
1. OUr Law takes knowledge of two manners of force, the one may be termed a
force in judgeme^t of Law, which accompteth every private Trespass to be a
force, so as if I do but pass over another man's ground without license, he
may have his action of Trespass against me, Quare vi and armis, etc.

2. The other manner of force is more apparent, and always carries some
fearful show, and matter of terror with it.

3. This last sort of force is, that which is prohibited by these statutes, and
therefore note that every force, punishable by these statutes must have one of
these two badges, sc. it must be either Manuforti, or multitudine.

4. Manuforti, sc. either with apparent violence (in deed, Dalton p. 177.
or word) offered to the person of another: as threatening speeches, turbulent
behavior, or actual violence; or else that they be furnished with offensive
weapons, by them not usually borne; and this may be done by one person only.

5. Multitudine, 10. H. 7. 12.
sc. with company more than usually they have attending on them, 10. H. 7. 12.
The law properly calls it a multitude, when there be three or more in one
company.

6. If therefore one, Forceible Entry.
or more persons shall come weaponed (especially with weapons not usually borne)
to a house or land, and shall violently enter thereinto, this is a forceible
Entry within the meaning of these statutes.

7. Much more if (being so entered) he or they shall there offer violence, or
fear of harm, Dalton p. 177.
to the person of any that is in possession thereof; most of all, if he or they
shall forceibly and furiously expel and drive another out of such his
possession.

8. So is it if one shall enter peaceably (the door being open, Dalton ibid.
or only latched,) and after he is in the house, he shall forceibly put
another out of his possession.

Dalton ibid.
9. So is it if he or they that shall enter peaceably, shall after their Entry
offer apparent violence, threatenings, or fear of harm to the person of any
that is in possession, to the intent to get him out, and to make him leave the
possession, though they do not put him out of possession, much more if they
get the possession thereby.

10. If he or they that have entered peaceably, shall after use words to any in
possession to this effect, Dalton pa. 178.
as to say they will hold or keep it, though they die for it, or in spite of
the other, or such like, or other threatening words, this makes it a forceible
Entry.

11. So it is if diverse persons shall come with weapons (not usually borne by
them) to a house that is open, Cromp. 69.
or to ground, and shall there enter peaceably without any disturbance, yet
this is a forceible Entry, for it shall be intended that they would have used
force, if they had been resisted.

10. H. 7. 12. Br. force 30.
12. So it is when the Master enters into an house or land, being attended with
a greater number of servants than usually do wait on him.

13. Note that though a man do actually use no force in his Entry, yet if he
do come so appointed, either with weapon, or company that other men may be
reasonably afraid that he minds to make his way by force, Dalton ibid.
rather then he will fail of his purpose, it seems to be a forceible Entry.

14. Also it seems that every Entry into another man's house, or ground which
is made with force ( sc. manuforti, A trespass. Dalton ibid.
or cum multitud.) either with apparent violence offered to the person of any
other, or furnished with weapons, or company which may cause fear) though it
be but to cut, or to take away another man's Corn, grass, or other goods, or
to fell or crop wood, or to do any other like trespass, though he do not put
the party out of his possession, yet it seems to be a Forceible Entry,
punishable by these statutes.

15. But if the Entry were peaceable, and after such Entry made, they cut or
take away any other man's Corn, Dalton ibid.
grass, wood or other goods without apparent violence, or force, though such
Acts are accounted a Disseisin with force, yet they seem not to be punishable
by these statutes: sc. the Justices of peace are not to remove, imprison, or
fine such offenders.

Cromp. 70. 11. H. 4. 16.
16. Also if one or more shall enter into another man's house, or land peaceably,
and after his or their Entry, shall by force or violence, cut or take away any
Corn, Grass, or wood, etc. or shall forcibly and wrongfully carry away any
other goods there being, this seems to be a forceible Entry punishable by
these statutes.

20. H. 6. 11.
17. So is it if a man shall distraine with force for a Rent (be it due or not
due) this does countervaile an Entry with force. Br. Forc. 1.

Dalton ibid.
18. And in these cases of Trespass only, the Justice of peace (upon complaint
to him made) may, as it seems, remove such force and upon view thereof, may
imprison and fine such offenders.

19. If a Disseisor has entered peaceably, By words. Dalton pa. 179.
and being entered shall presently threaten to kill the Disseisee, if he
reenter, this seems a Forceible Entry in the Disseisor.

20. But note, 2. H 7. 16. Br. force 25.
that a Forceible Entry cannot be without an actual Entry, for the words of
the statutes be, whosoever does enter, etc.

21. Note also, if one that has right to enter upon land, Cromp. 70.
shall go with diverse in his company, and with weapons over the land whereto
he has right, to the Church, Market, or some other place; this is no Entry
with force, except he shall express his intent, that he does enter there,
claiming the land.

22. Note also, that if a man shall enter with force (into house or land)
although he obtains not, 5. R. 2. ca. ^. 15. R. 2. ca. 2. 8. H. 6. ca. 9.
nor gets the actual possession thereby, yet shall he be imprisoned and
fined, for the only entering with force, as it seems, see the statutes in the
margent, but Restitution is not to be made, but only where there is a putting
out, and a holding out of another out of his possession.

23. If by fair means, Lawful. Dalton pa. 175.
a man (whose Entry is lawful) shall persuade or entice them which are within
the house, to come out, and then (the door being open, or shut by the latch
only) he shall enter peaceably, without multitude, offensive weapons, or other
violence; this Entry seems to be justifiable.

24. So is it, if he shall enter peaceably, Dalton ibid.
and then by gentle persuasions can send them out that are within the house,
and after shut the door, and keeps them out, this seems justifiable, so
that afterward he holds it not forceibly, nor uses violence or threatening
speeches.

25. So it is, if I shall take a man being out of his house, and then I do put
or send into the house my servant, or some other, Dalton ibid.
in peaceable manner, and do hold away the other by imprisonment of his
person; this is no forceible Entry, nor deteyner within these statutes, but a
false imprisonment punishable by action only.

26. So it is, if he whose Entry is lawful, Dalton ibid.
shall enter peaceably into his house (the doors being open, or shut by the
latch only) and being so entered, shall continue and abide there peaceably;
this is justifiable: And if they which were before in possession shall put or
thrust him out forceibly: this is a forceible deteyner of their parts.

27. Forceible Deteiner, Forceible deteiner. Dalton ibid.
must be understood of a forceible deteining of the possession of lands or
tenements, and not of the person of a man as before.

28. Note also, though the Entry were at the first peaceable, 8. H. 6. ca. 9.
P. force 4. Dalton pa. 180.
and lawful, yet if there be after a holding by force, it is punishable by the
statute, except where there was at the first a lawful and peaceable entry, and
thereupon a lawful possession, peaceably continued by the space of three
years together without interruption, for there a man may hold and keep such
possession with force against all others, saving against the Kings officers.

29. If the Justice of peace shall come to the place or house, that is supposed
to be holden with force, P.R. 41. Cromp. 70.
and there shall find the doors or gates shut, and he or they within shall
deny him to enter, or will not suffer him to enter, this is a forceible holding
or deteiner, though there be no weapons showed or used, and though there be
but one person in the house or upon the ground.

30. So it is, if when the Justice of Peace enters the house or ground, Ibid.
he shall find there any persons in harness, or otherwise armed, or having
harness, armor, or other weapons, not usually borne by them, lying ready,
this is a forceible Deteiner.

Ibid.
31. So it is if the Justice of Peace shall find in the house any great number
of people, other than the ordinary family, or company.

P.R. 41.
32. Also, if a man shall enter peaceably into a house, and after shall bring
into the same more weapons than he and his ordinary family do usually wear,
or shall make any use of such weapons as he does find in the house, to defend
his possession therewith, these are forceible Deteiners within these statutes.

33. If a man that has peaceably entered into an house, will bestow men with
force ( scil. with harness, Ibid.
guns, or other weapons, in some other house or place, not far distant) to
the intent that they may be ready to assault such as shall enter upon him, this
is a deteiner with force.

Cromp. 69.
34. So is it if the disseisor of a house or land, shall forestall the way of
the dissesee, with force and Arms, so that the disseisee dares not enter nor
come near thereto for fear of death, etc.

Dalton page
35. So is it if a man shall keep his cattle in another man's ground by force,
P.R. 39.
claming Common there, when he has no Common, in this case, the Justice of
peace upon complaint to him made may remove this force; And upon view thereof
may record it, and may commit such offenders to prison, and may fine them, but
cannot award restitution.

By words.
36. Also there may be a forceible deteining of possession by word only without
any forceible Act.

Cromp. 70. P.R. 39.
37. As if A. has wrongfully (though peaceably) entered into the house or upon
the land of B. and has put out B. and shall presently threaten, or say to B.
that if he do come thither again to enter he will kill him. This seems a
forceible Entry by A. and if B. shall afterward come again to make his
Entry, and then A. shall threaten to kill him, if he enters there, this is a
forceible deteiner in A.

38. And it seems that to threaten to maime, beat, or to do other bodily
hurt to B. in the case aforesaid amounts to a forceible Entry, or deteiner,
for that death may ensue upon such beating, or hurt, See 39. H. 6. 50. 7. E. 4.
21.

39. H. 6. 50.
39. But to threaten to burn the house, or to spoil his goods therein (if B.
shall come thither to enter again) this seems not to amount to any such
matter, Br. Dures. 9. 12. 16.
for that B. may afterward have his action for the burning of his house, or
spoiling of his goods, and shall thereby recover damages to the value thereof,
etc.

40. Also when B. shall come to make his Entry as aforesaid, Cromp. 70.
if A. shall say to him that he will not open the door, this is no forceible
deteiner.

41. So it is if A. be in possession of a house, Cromp. 73.
or has a lease thereof at the will of B. and after B. enters into the house
and commands A. to go out, and to leave him the possession, and A. will not
go out, this is no force, for refusing, or denying only to go out, is no
force, unless there be withal some forceible Act or threatening speeches, ubi
factum nullum ibi fortia nulla, where there is no fact, there is no force. Co.
4. 43.

42. A morgageth his house to B. upon condition, that if A. shall pay to B.
such a day 40. Dalton pa. 181.
l. then the said morgage (and feoffment to be void) and by agreement of them
both A. the morgager continues the possession until the day of redemption, at
which day A. pays not the 40. l. and after B. comes to reenter, and A.
keeps the possession by force, this is a deteiner by force in A. by the
opinion of Master Richard Godfrey in a case between Willowes and Thurger,
which opinion I conceive to be good Law, for the possession of the morgager,
after the morgage by agreement was in Law the possession of the morgagee.

43. Cromp. 69.
The disseisor makes a gift in Tail to B. who keeps the land with force at
the time when the disseisee makes his claim, which claim is made within the
view, so near as he dares, Litt. 429.
for fear of death, battery, or other bodily hurt, if B. after such claim
shall continue the possess. with force, he may be thereof indicted, for this
amounts to a new Entry and a deteiner with force by B.

44. And note that wheresoever mine Entry is lawful, Dalton. page 181.
if the possess. be detained or holden from me by force, I may pray the aid of
the Justices of peace to remove such force as it seems.

45. Rent. Cromp. 70. P.R. 63. Dalton pa. 181.
If a man has a Rent or common of pasture out of another man's land, and
coming to distraine for his rent or to use his common, he is so forceibly
resisted by the Tenant of the land, that he cannot, or dares not, either
distraine for his rent or take the benefit of his common. This is a holding
with force in the Tenant, and punishable by these statutes.

46. Cromp. 69.
So it is if the Tenant of the land shall forestall the way with force and
Arms, or shall threaten him (that has the rent or Common) so that he dares
not to come to distraine for his rent, nor to take his Common.

47. So it is if a man shall distraine for his rent, Ibid. Dalton 181. and 182.
and the Tenant of the land shall make rescous with force and Arms.

48. And in these cases (of a rent or common) the Justice of peace upon
complaint to him made, may remove such force, and upon view of such force may
record it, and may therefore imprison and fine such offenders, but cannot award
restitution, sc. cannot restore the party to his rent or Common (which are to
be taken and used in another man's land) for restitution is not to be made, but
only of the house or land as you may see hereafter in its proper place.

Who may commit a forceible Entry, etc. CHAP. 31.
1. ONe person alone may commit or make a forceible Entry or deteiner, The
persons.
if so be he do it with offensive weapons, or do use turbulent behavior to
the terror or Affray of others. Dalton 182.


Cromp. 69.
2. An infant of the age of Eighteen years, by his own Act may commit a
forceible Entry, or deteiner, and so he may though he be under Eighteen,
Dalton 18^.
yet it shall be good discretion in the Justices of P. to forbear the
imprisonment of such Infants. See Br. Impris. 43. 45. 75. 101.

3. But if an infant commands another to enter or hold with force to his use,
Dalton ibid.
which is done accordingly, yet the Infant shall not be punished for such
offense, for his commandment therein was void.

Cromp. 69. 16. Ass. 7. Br. Impris. 45. 53. See more after in the title riot.
4. Also a feme Covert, by her own Act, may commit a forceible entry, or
deteiner, and upon the Justices view of the force, she shall be imprisoned (and
it seems also she may be fined in such case) But such fine set upon the wife
shall not be levied upon the husband, for the husband shall never be charged
for the Act or default of his wife, but when he is made a party to the action,
and judgment given against him and his wife. Co. 9. 72. and Co. 11. 61.

2. H. 7. 16.
5. Diverse do enter with force to the use of A. who is not then present with
them, but does after agree thereto, this agreement after makes A. to be a
disseisor, Br. force 25.
but not to be punished for the force, and if A. had counseled, consented, or
agreed thereto before the Entry, yet it seems that a commandment, consent,
or agreement before or after, though it may make one a disseisor, yet it is not
to be punished by the Justice of peace upon these statutes, Consent.
for that a forceible Entry cannot be adjudged against a man, without an
actual Entry be also made by him, or that at least he be present.

6. But if A. that shall command or counsel others thereto, shall also be
present at the time of the Entry, Dalton. 182.
although he does then nothing, yet he is now become a principal and
punishable by these statutes.

7. If diverse do come in one company, to enter into lands, etc. where their
entry is not lawful, Dalton 183.
and all of them saving one did enter, and demean themselves in peaceable
manner, and one only does enter with force or (after entry made) does use force
and violence, this shall be adjudged a forceible Entry in them all, although
the force were against their wills, Co. 9. 67. 112. and 11. 5.
for where diverse do come in one company to any place, to the intent to do
any unlawful thing, be it robbery, homicide, riot, affray, or any trespass,
here every one of them shall be adjudged a principal doer, although they stand
but by and do nothing: So it seems though some of them come without any
intent of evil, if they came together in company with the other offenders, or
if they came after, yet if they be either ayding, or countenancing to the
offenders, they shall be also adjudged principal doers as well as the other.

8. An Indictment upon the statute of 8. H. 6. for the King, The person^ put
out. Co. 1. 46. and 10. 112.
is not good, for the King cannot be disseised, nor put out of his freehold,
neither can the King bring any action upon the statute of 8. H. 6. nor any
other action which might prove him out of possession of the land.

9. And if the K. termor be put out by force, The Kings Tenant. Dalton 183.
Cromp. 69.
he cannot prefer a bill of indictment upon the statute of 8. H. 6. that he
was put out and the King disseised. But he must have an Information of
Intrusion in the Exchequer.

10. Dalton 183.
Yet it seems that upon complaint made to a Just. of peace by the K. termor
of any such force, the Justice of peace ought to remove the force, and upon his
view thereof, to record it, and to commit the offenders to prison, and may fine
them, and after such force removed, the Kings termor may presently reenter (if
he can) in peaceable manner.

11. If a forceible entry, Lesse^ for years Coppihold^^.
or deteiner shall be made upon any Lessee for years, Tenant at will, or upon
a Coppiholder whether it be by an estranger, or by the lessor, or by the Lord,
the Justices of peace upon their view thereof are to remove such force, Dalton
183.
and may commit to prison the parties which made such entry, or which shall
hold it with force, and may fine them, but whether the Justice of peace may
make such restitution and set them, sc. the Lessee for years, Tenant at will,
or Coppiholder into their possessions again has been much questioned: But
now by a statute made in Ireland in 10. Caroli ca. 13. restitution shall be
made to Tenant for years, Tenant at will, Coppiholder, Tenant by Elegit or
statute merchant or of the staple.

12. Some held opinion that before this statute the Justice of peace may put
them in possession again, and of this opinion was Master Marrow, and Master
Lamb. and to maintain this opinion these reasons may be given.

1. First, for that the words of the statutes seem to warrant it, for the
statute 15. R. 2. in the Preamble thereof, as also the stat. 8. H. 6. in the
body thereof has this word (possessions) which word most properly does extend
to a lease for years, etc.

2. Again, that clause of the stat. 8. H. 6. which provideth for the
restitution is thus, if it be found that any does contrary to this statute,
then the said Justice, etc. shall put the party so put out in full possession,
etc.

13. Now it cannot be denied, but that he which by force expulseth Lessee for
years, tenant at will, or a coppiholder does contrary to this statute, also
they be the parties put out, and the same mischief and inconvenience which
these laws do labor to remove, is to Lessee for years, tenant at will, and
to the coppiholder; Co. 11. 33. 34. Plo. 178.
And we may find it usual, that where statutes are made for to remedy any
common mischief there (to help things in the same degree) one action, thing,
place, and person, has in construction been taken for another, and a good
expounder (says Sir Ed. Co. 11. 34) makes every sentence to have his
operation to suppress all the mischiefs before the said Act, and principally
those that are specified in these acts.

Co. 3. 7. and 12. and 73.
14. And again says he, it is the office of the Judges always to make such
construction of statutes as may repress the mischief, and advance the
remedy, and to suppress all evasions which may continue the mischief, and to
add force and life to the cure, and remedy, according to the true intent of
the makers of the statute. Co. 11. 73. b. and Co. 3. 7.

15. Others held the contrary, sc. that Lessee for years, nor a coppiholder,
or tenant at will cannot have restitution by the hands of the Justice of Peace,
and this was the common opinion, their reason is, for that the words in the
statute of 8. H. 6. (in that clause which specially provideth for the
restitution) are thus, The said Justices, etc. shall reseise the said lands or
tenements, and thereof shall put the party so put out in full possession, etc.
which words (lands or tenements) are only to be understood of them that have
inheritance, Rast. 174.
or a freehold at the least, but to this it may be answered, that the said
statute of 8. H. 6. in the body thereof has these words, where any do make
any Forceible Entry into lands, tenements, or other possessions, or them hold
forceibly, etc. which words, possessions extends to a lease for years, etc.
And then the words (possessions) being in the same statute, we shall find that
a statute is to be expounded upon all the parts thereof together, Co. 3. 59.
b. and 8. 117.
and not upon one part alone by it self, to which purpose, see Lincoln
College case, and Doctor Donhams case, in Sir Edw. Cokes Reports.

16. But it seems to those which hold this last opinion, that if a Lessee for
years, Tenant at will, or a Coppiholder, be forceibly put out, or held out by
an estranger, if they will have restitution, their indictment must be made and
preferred in the lessor or Lords name, Cromp. 161.
and the Jury must find that the Lessor or Lord was disseised, etc. and then
the Lessor or Lord shall have restitution, And so by their restitution, their
Lessee or Coppiholder is restored also. But such Lessee or Coppiholder cannot
(say they) prefer an indictment in their own name upon the statute 8. Hen.
6. for that they have no Freehold.

Cromp. 249. 2.
17. And to that purpose I find some presidents of indictments in this form,
viz. in unum messuag. apud etc. adtunc existent. liberum tenementum. M.D.
armiger vi and armis, etc. Manuforti and illicite tunc inde expulerunt and
ejecerunt and pref. M.D. inde injuste dissesiverunt.

18. And by this opinion if a Lessee for years, tenant at will, or a
Coppiholder be forceibly put out by their Lessor or Lord, such Lessee or
Coppiholder has no remedy at all by indictment upon this statute, for they
have no Freehold, and therefore can have no restitution upon this statute.

19. Cromp. 71.
Also by this opinion if the Lessee for years be put out by his Lessor, and
after the Lessee puts out the Lessor again forceibly, the Lessee shall not
be indicted, neither shall the Lessor have restitution upon this statute, for
that the Lessor is not ousted nor disseised of his Freehold, for the
possession of the Lessee is such a seisin of the Lessor of his Freehold, that
he may have an Assise, if his Lessee be put out; And so of a Coppiholder, not
having forfeited his estate, if his Lord notwithstanding shall enter upon him,
and put him out, and the coppiholder shall reenter upon his Lord with force,
the Coppiholder shall not be indicted, nor yet the Lord restored, causa qua
supra.

20. And so by this last opinion, the very mischief specified and intended to
be helped by these statutes, should seem still to remain in all cases
between such Lessees, and Coppiholders, and their Lessors or Lords, so as
there can be no inquiry, nor restitution, in cases of Forceible Entry or
detainer between them.

21. But howsoever the law be taken for the indictment or restitution
thereupon, yet in case that Lessee for years, tenant at will, or a Coppiholder
be forceibly put out, or held out, either by a stranger, or by their Lessor, or
Lord, the Justices of Peace, Cromp. 71.
or any one of them by the statute 15. R. 2. ca. 2. may safely remove the force
upon view thereof, and may commit the offenders to prison, and then the Lessee
for years, or Coppiholder may presently reenter, if peaceably they can so do,
and so may have his possession again without any restitution made him by the
Justices.

22. But these statutes are now by a statute made in 10. 10. Caroli c. 1^^ in
Ireland.
Caroli clearly explained, which statute ensues in these words, viz:

Whereas there is one good Act made and established in England in the eight
year of the reign of King Henry the sixth, against such persons as should make
forceible Entries into lands, tenements, and other possessions, or them should
forceibly hold, and one very good proviso; or clause in the said Act contained,
as ensues, viz. Provided always that they which keep their possessions with
force in any lands and tenements, whereof they or their ancestors have
continued their possession in the same by three years or more, be not
endamaged by force of the said statute. And whereas diverse of the Kings
Majesty's good and loving Subjects and their Ancestors, or those whose estate
they have for many years together above the space of three years, or more,
have been in quiet possession of their dwelling houses, and other their lands
and possessions, and now of late diverse of his Majesty's said Subjects having
Entries made upon their possessions, having had such quiet and long possession,
for disturbing of such Entries, and for keeping of their possession against
such enterers, by color of Indictments of forceible Entry or forceible
keeping possession found against them, by means of the oaths of such
enterers, have been removed and put out of their dwelling houses and other
their possessions, which they have quietly held by the space of three years
together, or longer time, next before such indictments found against them,
against the true meaning and intent of the said proviso, or clause contained in
the said Act, for remedy of which inconvenience and for true declaration and
explanation of the Law therein, be it ordained, declared and enacted by the
authority of this present parliament that no restitution upon any indictment of
forceible Entry, or holding with force, be made unto any person, or persons,
if the person or persons so indicted has or have had the occupation, or has
or have been in the quiet possession by the space of three whole years
together next before the day of such indictment so found, and his, her or their
estate or estates therein not ended, nor determined which the party indicted,
shall and may allege for stay of restitution, and restitution to stay, until
that be tried if the other will deny or traverse the same. And if the same
allegations be tried against the same person or persons so indicted, then the
same person or persons so indicted to pay such Costs and damages to the other
party, as shall be assessed by the Judges or Justices, before whom the same
shall be tried, the same Costs and damages to be recovered and levied as is
usual for Costs and damages contained in Judgment upon other Actions. And be
it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that such Judges, Justices, or
Justice of peace as by reason of any Act, or Acts of Parliament, now in force,
are authorized and enabled upon enquiry to give restitution of possession unto
the Tenants of any estate of Freehold, of their lands, or tenements, which
shall be entered upon with force, or from them withholden by force, shall by
reason of this present Act, have the like, and the same authority and ability
from henceforth (upon indictment of such forceible Entries, or forceible
withholding before them duly found) to give like restitution of possession
unto Tenants for Term of years, Tenants by Copy of Court Roll, Guardians by
Knights service, Tenants by Elegit, Statute Merchants, and Staple, of lands or
tenements by them so holden, which shall be entered upon by force, or holden
from them by force. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that
all and every Justice and Justices of Assize, shall for ever hereafter in their
several circuits respectively have the like power and authority, to all
intents and purposes to inquire, hear and determine of all forceible Entries,
and forceible holding, and all other offenses as well against the said statute
of Octavo of King Henry the sixth, as against this present statute, and to award
restitution of possession in all cases, as any other Judge, or Justice, or
Justices of the peace could, or may do by this Act, or by any other Statute of
force within this Realm.

23. Now to show something more what the Law accompteth to be force, and what
weapons Weapons.
be offensive in these and the like cases Master Bracton says, Omnes illos
dicimus armatos, Dalton 186.
qui habent cum quo nocere possunt, and therefore to have harness, guns, Bows
and arrows, Crosbowes, halberts, Iavelins, bills, clubs, pikes, pitchforkes, or
swords, not usually borne, by the parties, shall be said to be vis armata.

24. Again, Si quis venerit cum armis, and dejecerit, vis tamen armata
dicitur, sufficit enim terror armorum, Si quis venerit sine armis, and in ipsa
concertatione, ligna sumpserit fustes, aut lapides, vis dicitur armata.

25. And so to use casting of stones, hot coals, scalding water, or lead, or
any other thing wherewith one may hurt the person of another, shall be said to
be vis armata.

26. Next where a force, Lawful force.
or forceible defense is justifieable and where not.

27. Force being opposed against the Law, is utterly forbidden but being used
in the maintenance of the Law, and with the warrant of Law, it is allowed, for
that it mainetaineth the peace of the realm. P.R. 41. Dalton 186
And therefore force may lawfully be used by all the Kings officers, ministers,
and subjects thereunto deputed, for the execution, or advancement of Justice,
or of the judgments of the Law.

28. And so first it is a lawful force, Ibid.
whereby all offenders in Treason, felony, and other great crimes, be pursued,
apprehended, carried to prison, and receive their condign punishments.

29. Ibid.
It is also a lawful force whereby the Sheriff and his officers do apprehend
any person by virtue of the Kings writ.

30. 3. H. 7.
And so it is a lawful force whereby Justices of peace do remove unlawful
entries, or holdings of possessions, Br. Riots 73.
and repress Riotters, and do arrest and send to prison such offenders: And
in these and the like cases, the Kings officer, ( scil. the Sheriff, Justice
of peace and Constable) may take the help of others, what number they shall
think meet to assist them, when need shall require.

31. Also it is a lawful force which Justices of peace, Sheriffs, Dalton 186.
Coroners, and Constables, shall use in apprehending, or committing to prison
such as within their several jurisdictions and in their presence, shall in any
sort break, or attempt to disturb, or break the peace, and they may therein
take the assistance of others as aforesaid.

32. Also in these cases following, it is lawful for the K. officers, P.R. 41.
by force to break open a man's house, to arrest offenders being therein, if
the doors be all shut, so as the officer cannot otherwise enter the house, viz.

33. For the apprehending of any person for treason, felony, Co. 5. 92.
or suspicion of felony or Treason. 13. E. 4. 9. Br. Coron. 159.

Dalton 187.
34. Where one has dangerously wounded another, and then flying into an house,
the Constable or other officer upon fresh suite may break open the door, and
apprehend the offender, and so may any other person besides the officer, as it
seems. 7. E. 3. 19. Crom. 171.

Ibid.
35. Where there shall be an affray made in a house, and the doors shut, the
Constable, etc. may break into the house to see the peace kept.

Ibid.
36. So upon a forceible Entry, or detainer found by Inquisition before any
Justice of peace, or viewed by the Justice himself, or the Sheriff by his
warrant may break into the house to apprehend the offenders.

Ibid.
37. Upon a Capias utlagatum, in any personal action, as also upon a Capias pro
fine directed to the Sheriff, the Sheriff may break open the doors, etc.

Ibid.
38. Upon a warrant for the peace or good behavior, the Constables may break
open the house, by the opinions of Popham and Clerk, Justices of Assise at
Cambridge Assizes. 3. Iac. Reg.

39. Lastly, in all cases where the K. is a party, or has Interest in the
business, Co. 5. 91. 13. Ed. 4. 9.
the officers may break open the doors as aforesaid; For no man's house shall
be a Castle against the King. Co. 5. 91. And yet the Sheriff nor his officers
may not break open any man's house to execute the Kings process, upon the body
or goods of any person at the suite of any subject. Co. 5. 92. 95.

40. But when a house is recovered by any real action, or by ejectione firmae,
there the Sheriff may break the house and deliver seisin or possession to the
demandant or plaint, for after judgment it is no more (in the right or
judgment of Law) the house of the tenant or defendant. Co. 5. 91.

41. But note that the officer, before he break open the house or doors of
any person, Co. 5. 91.
he must first signify the cause of his coming, and desire that the doors
may be opened unto him.

Co. 5. 91. and 11. 82. 21. H. 7. 39.
42. Note also though no man may forceibly keep his house against the Kings
officers in the cases aforesaid, yet every man's house is to himself, Forceible
de fence lawful.
his family, and his goods as his Castle, as well for his d^fence against
injury and violence, as also for his repose and rest. And therefore the Law
does give to dwelling houses diverse privileges.

1. First, that it is a man's Castle for his defense as aforesaid.

2. Also a man's house has the privileges to protect him against any arrest by
force of any process at the suite of any subject as aforesaid.

Co. 11. 8.
3. A man's house in some cases has a privilege against the Kings prerogative,
for it has been adjudged that Saltpetermen cannot dig in the mansion house of
any subject without his assent, in regard of the danger that may happen thereby
in the night time to the owner, his family and goods, by thieves and other
malefactors. Co. 11. 82.

4. If Thieves shall come to a man's house to rob, or murder him, Co. 5. 91. and
11. 82.
he may lawfully assemble company to defend his house by force, and if he or
any of his company shall kill any of them in defense of himself, his family,
his goods or house, this is no felony, neither shall they forfeite any thing
therefore.

5. Cromp. 70
Also a man that is in possession of a house peaceably and doubts that
another (who indeed has more right to the possession, and who may enter) will
enter upon him, here he which is in possession may defend and keep his
possession of the house with his ordinary company, and may justify to beat
the other which shall attempt to enter upon him. But if he kill him, it is
felony, nay he in possession (in this former case) may not hire any strangers
to aid him, neither may he have his own ordinary company in armor, nor
otherwise be provided with Bows, or guns to shoot at the other as it seems.
Cromp. 70. a.

6. Also if a man being in his house, In defense of his person. 21. H. 7. 39.
Br. Riots 1. Co. 11. 82.
do hear that another will come thither to beat him, he may lawfully assemble
his neighbors and friends, etc. to assist and aid him there, in the defense
of his person.

7. And yet if he or any of his company shall kill the other, or any of the
other company in such defense of himself or his, Dalton 188.
this seems to be such a felony in all of them which be in the house, and in
that action, that they shall forfeit their goods thereby.

43. But if a man be threatened that if he come to such a place, 21. H 7. 3^.
Co. 11. 82.
that then he shall be beaten, in this case he may not assemble any company to
go thither to safeguard his person: for there is no necessity of his going
thither: Besides, he may have surety of the peace against such as threatened him.

44. If there be an attempt made to beat a man, his wife, father, In defense of
others. Dalton 188.
mother, or any of his children (within age) he may lawfully use force to
resist it, and may justify the beating of the other in such case.

45. Also the servant may justify to beat another in defense of his master.
Br. Trespass. 217. 21. H. 7. 39. 2.


46. In defense of his goods. Cromp. 65. 69.
Also a man may justify to beat another in the defense of the possession of
his goods, and if another has taken away my goods, may take them again from
him with force.

47. Also if there be an attempt made to disseise me of my land, Dalton 188.
or to disturb me of my high way, or to turn an ancient water course from my
Mill, I may lawfully use force to resist it.

48. A Keeper does enter and chase upon my land, pretending this to be within
his purliew, where it is not, Dyer. 327. Cromp. 68.
if I command my servants to beat him of my ground, this seems justifiable in
the defense of my possession against such unlawful claim.

Where Forceible Detainer of possession is lawful. CHAP. 32.
8. H. 6. c. 9. Br. force 4. 10. carol. ca. 13. in Ireland.
1. THe statute of 8. H. 6. concludes thus, Provided that such as keep their
possession by force after that they, or their ancestors, etc. have continued
their possession in the same 3. years, or more, shall not be indamaged by
force of that statute.

22. H. 6. f. 18 b.
2. This proviso must (as it seems) be thus construed, sc. that where a man is
seized (of a lawful estate or posses.) of an house or lands, or he and his
ancestors, or they whose estate he has therein have continued the posses. of
the same peaceably by the space of 3. whole years together without
interruption (and his estate not ended) there he may hold and keep such
possession with force, See the stat.
against all others, yea it seems if he shall hire strangers to aid him, to
keep such possession, or shall have his company in armor, he is not
punishable by these statutes: but he may not resist the Justices of Peace that
shall come to view this.

10. Caroli c. 13. ^n Ireland.
3. And if he shall be indicted for such his forceible holding (after three
years) such quiet possession, he may plead such his lawful and peaceable
possession by the space of three years next before such indictment, and
thereby he shall avoid both the imprisonment and fine, and also shall debar
the other party of his restitution; Neither may the Justices of peace remove
him from his possession, though it be found by the Inquisition taken before
them, that he held that house or land by force, after three years lawful and
peaceable possession, as aforesaid.

4. But here it seems these four diversities are to be observed:

6. and 7. Ed. 6. 22. H. ^ 8.
1. First, where the party in possession did enter peaceably and where
forceibly, for if a man enter forceibly and after continues his possession
peaceably by the space of three years without interruption, Br. Rest^. 12.
yet it seems he shall not be aided by the proviso in the statute of 8. H. 6.
ca. 9.

2. Secondly, where the party in possession has continued his three years
possession peaceably, Br. force 22. and 19.
and where by force, for if after a lawful and peaceable entry a man shall
continue or hold his possession by force, this is a Forceible holding or
deteyner, and punishable by the statute of S. H. 6. And three years of such
possession shall not aid him.

22. H. 6. 18. b. Fi Enter 20. Br. force 6. Vide 23. H 8. page seq. 14. H. 7.
18. Br. force 10.
3. Thirdly, where the party in possession is in by right, and of a lawful
estate, or by wrong as a disseisor, and yet without force, and has continued
such his possession peaceably by the space of three years, without
interruption, he shall be aided by the Proviso of the said statute of S. H. 6.
and by the statute of 10. Caroli ca. 13. and not removed from the possession
upon an Indictment, but if a disseisor has continued his possession forceibly
by the space of 20. years together, yet he may be indicted upon the said
statute of 8. H. 6. before a Justice of peace, of the forceible detayning of
the same, and the same being found the said Justice of Peace is to reseise the
same, and to award restitution to the party disseised, or so put out.

4. Fourthly, where the party has continued such his possession three years
without interruption, and where his possession has been interrupted or
discontinued, for if a man has been in peaceable possession of land, etc. by
the space of three years and above, by a good title, and then is disseised and
expelled by force, and the disseisee reentreth peaceably, or the disseisor is
therefore indicted upon the statute of 8. H. 6. and the disseisee is thereupon
restored, Dyer. 142. Br. force 32. and 29.
and is in possession accordingly, yet in these cases the disseisee cannot
justify the Detainer of the possession of those lands by force, because his
possession was once interrupted, but after such interruption and reentry, or
restitution, if he shall continue a peaceable posses. again for three years
together, then it seems he may justify the Deteiner of the posses. thereof
by force, by virtue of the Proviso in the stat. of 8. H. 6.

5. If a Disseisor has continued his possession peaceably three years, and
after the disseisee does reenter, 23. H. 8. Br. force 22.
or does make his claim so near as he dares, and then the disseisor
reentreth again, or continues his possession after such claim, here the
disseisor cannot justify to hold the same with force, Lit. 429.
for by the reentry or claim of the disseisee, the first disseisin and
possession of the disseisor was determined, and the disseisor is in of a new
disseisin.

6. Also if he that has been a lawful possessor of lands by the space of
Twenty years together, be once clearly and wholly removed from the possession
of the same land, he cannot come with force, or multitude, to put himself in
possession thereof again, and to detayne the same with force, because his
possession was once interrupted, and if he be indicted (upon the statute of 8.
H. 6.) for such Forceible Entry, he shall not be relieved (touching the
restitution) by the stat. of 10. Carol. for that he had not the occupation of
the said lands, nor had been in quiet possession thereof by the space of three
years together, next before the day of such indictment found.

How many several remedies the party has which forceibly is either put out,
or kept out of the possession of his houses or lands. CHAP. 33.
1. FIrst, the party so grieved (having an estate for life, Action upon the
statute of 8. H. 6. 1. R. 2. ca. 9. 8. H. 6. ca. 9. F. N. B. 348. c. c. and
249. 2. co. 10. 115.
in Tail or Fee,) may have his Assise, or action of trespass of Forceible
Entry upon the statute of 8. H. 6. against such disseisor, and therein if the
defendant be attainted of force, he shall fine to the King, and also answer to
the plaintiff his treble damages, and treble Costs of suit, and also the
plaintiff shall thereupon have a writ of restitution to restore him to his
former estate.

2. But this action being the suit of the party, and only for the right, 9 H.
6. 16.
this remedy (by action) is only where the Entry of the defendant was not
lawful, Fitz. 248. h.
for if a man enters with force, where his Entry is lawful, as if the
disseisee shall enter upon the disseisor with force, he shall not be punished
by action: But yet he may be indicted upon the statute, Br. force 29.
and upon such indictment found, the party put out shall be restored, for the
indictment is for the force, and for the King, and here the offender shall make
fine to the King, although his right be never so good. Br. Force 11.

3. Also the party so grieved if he will loose the benefit of his treble
damages and costs, Writ upon the statute of Northampton.
he may be aided, and have the assistance of the Justices of peace and that
after diverse sorts, first he may purchase a writ out of the Chancery directed
to the Sheriff only, or the Sheriff and Justices of peace, and to every of
them, for to remove the force, and this is upon the statute of Northhampton. 2.
E. 3. cap. 3. the form of which writ you may see F. N. B. 249. f.

Cromp: 74. 162.
4. But upon this writ the Justice of peace is to proceed only as a minister,
and is to certify his doings herein, and that Justice of peace to whom the
writ shall be delivered, ought for to execute it, scil. he may remove the
force, but here he may not put the party in possession again, who was put out.

Indictment in Sessions.
5. Also the party grieved, may at the general Sessions of the peace within the
same County, prefer his bill of indictment, upon the statute of 8. H. 6. for
such forceible entry or deteiner, which being found there, Dyer. 187. Cromp.
165.
the complaynant shall be restored to his possession by a writ of restitution
granted out of the said Court to the Sheriff.

6. Also the party so grieved, for a more speedy remedy, may complain to any
one or more Justices of peace of the same County of the said force, By the In
out of Sessions.
and thereupon the said Justice of peace may ex officio, Dalton 191. and 192.
and without any writ, either do execution of the statute of Northhampton as
aforesaid; Or else the said Justice of peace upon such complaint may go to the
place where such force is, to see it, and may remove the force, and arrest and
commit the offenders, which he shall find committing the force, and shall also
keep a special Sessions to inquire of the said force, and if upon such inquiry
such force shall be found, then the said Justice shall restore the party
grieved to his possession again, and here no other Justice of peace can grant
a Supersedeas to stay the same restitution.

Dalton 192.
7. Also the party grieved may remove such indictment found either at such
general or special Sessions, by a Certiorari into the Kings Bench, and the
Judges of that Court may award a writ of restitution to the Sheriff of the
County to restore possession to the party.

E^quirie.
8. Now when the Justice of peace shall make such inquiry he shall direct his
precept or warrant to the Sheriff commanding him to cause to come before the
said Justice of peace, Dalton ibid.
at some good Town near to the place, 24. sufficient and indifferent persons
dwelling near to the said lands or tenements, whereof every one shall have in
lands or tenements 40.s. by the year at the least, to inquire upon their
oaths of such force.

9. Upon default of appearance of those Jurors, the Just. of peace may award an
alias and after that Pluries in finite, till they come, 8. H. 6. c. 9.
but so that at the day of the second precept, or writ, the Sheriff must
return 40.s. in issues upon every one of them, and at the third writ 5. li.
and at every day after the double.

10. And although any of such Jurors shall not have 40.s. land per annum, yet
their presentment of such force is good for the King, so as the offenders shall
be fined to the King. But the party shall have no restitution upon such a
presentment if it be pleaded at or before the time of the awarding of the
restitution, for the statute of 8. H. 6. ca. 9. requires that such Iuror shall
have 40.s. freehold per annum at the least.

11. If the Sheriff shall return smaller issues upon the Enquirors then the
statute does appoint, yet the party indicted shall not impeach the enquiry
therefore, neither is it cause to impeach the enquiry, though the Justice of
peace do not go to see the place where the force is.

12. And it is convenient upon such enquiry that the Evidence be given openly
to the Jury, to the intent it may appear to the Justices of peace or Court,
whether there shall be reasonable cause to stay restitution or no, after the
indictment found, See Dyer. 122.

Of restitution to be made to the party put out. CHAP. 34.
1. I Will here shortly recite the words of the statute, Restitution.
which for this business of restitution will give the better light, which are
as follows, videlicet: 8. H 6. ca. 9.
And if upon such enquiry it be found before the said Justices that any have
done contrary to this statute ( viz. have entered or held with force) the said
Justice of peace, etc. shall reseise the said lands or tenements so entered upon
or holden, and put the party so put out, in full possession of the same lands
and tenements so entered or holden as before.

2. Here we see that after such forceible Entry, P.R. 35.
or holding so found by enquiry, the said Justice of peace, etc. shall remove
the force sc. all such offenders as shall be found in the house or upon the
lands, that either entered or held with force, and upon the prayer of the party
so put out, the said Justice of peace shall restore him to his possession
again.

3. And herein the Justice of peace needs not to stay, or stand upon the
right and title of either of the parties, as is said before.

4. But no restitution shall be made, but where the forceible entry or detainer
is first found by Inquisition. Br. force 27.

5. Concerning this Inquisition or Indictment, the Justices of peace shall do
well to peruse and regard the same, Cromp. 166.
to see if it be sufficient, Indictment the form.
for the Justice of peace ought not to award restitution, where the indictment
shall appear to them to be any way insufficient in the Law either in matter or
form.

Dalton 193.
6. First therefore to have restitution, the putting out (by express words)
must be in the indictment and found by the Inquisition, for another man may
enter upon me, and yet not put me out, and then there needs no restitution to
be made by the Justices.

7. And this putting out, is to be understood only of the house, or land, Ibid.
and not of a rent common, advowson, and such like, into which an actual Entry
cannot be made, and therefore none shall have restitution but such only as are
put out of the house, or land, as is formerly, ca. 29. herein declared.

Ibid.
8. Also the indictment ought to express the quality of the thing entered upon,
etc. sc. whether it be a message, cottage, meadow, pasture, wood, or land,
errable; for if the indictment be, quod manuforti intraverunt in tenement. etc.
it is void for the incertainty, because the word tenementum may extend to
either of them.

9. Also the indictment must have these words, sc. adhuc extra tenent, 14. H. 6
16. Br. force 13.
otherwise the party shall have no restitution, and yet these words be not in
the statute, but without these words in the Indictment it may be supposed and
thought that he which put me out has left the possession again, or that I
have gotten it again, and then the restitution is needless.

Dalton 193.
10. So as in every such indictment, these words are material, sc. expulerunt,
and adhuc extra tenent. And for lack of either of these words, no restitution
shall be made, or awarded.

11. Also one of these two words Manuforti or cum multitudine seem to be
material in the indictment, Dalton 194.
unless they be employed by reciting the statute of 8. H. 6. and concluding
contra formam statut. predict. or by some other words in the Indictment: See
the presidents herein in the title of warrants and presidents.

Cromp. 162.
12. If a man shall be restored upon an insufficient indictment taken before the
Justice of peace, and this be removed into the Kings Bench, the Court there
will cause the party to be restored that before was put out by the Justice of
peace by a writ of restitution.

Cromp. 165. and 166. b.
13. Also if error or insufficiency be in the indictment taken before Justices
of peace, and yet restitution is awarded by them, any two of those Justices of
peace which were present at the taking of the said indictment upon the prayer
of the party, may (at another Sessions) grant and award a Supersedeas to the
Sheriff to stay the same restitution, Dyer. 187.
if the Sheriff has not made restitution before the Supersedeas come to his
hands, but no other Justice of peace besides those which were present at the
taking and finding of the said indictment) can grant a Supersedeas, if the
indictment were found at a special Sessions.

14. A man is indicted that he entered with force, and held with force, and upon
the traverse, it is found that he entered with force, Cromp. 165.
but not that he held with force, yet this indictment seems good enough, and
the party shall be restored.

15. So if two be indicted of a forceible Entry, or deteiner, Several
indictments.
and upon the traverse it is found that the one entered with force and the other
held or detained with force, yet the party shall be restored. Ibid.


16. If it be found by one Enquest, that A. put me out by force, Dalton 194.
Cromp. 166. Br. force 6.
and by another Enquest, that I did put out A. by force, either of us may pray
to have restitution against the other, but he that is first restored is in the
worst case, for the other may have restitution afterward, and then he that had
restitution first is without remedy by the hands of the Justice of peace,
saving that he may reenter if he can peaceably, or have his action.

17. If it be found by one Enquest that A. did put me out by force, and by
another Enquest taken at the same Sessions that B. did put me out by force, I
may choose upon whether of these indictments I will be restored, Cromp. 166.
and if I have restitution against A. and this be returned, I cannot have
restitution upon the other: Dalton 194.
But if (upon the writ of restitution) it be not returned that I have
restitution, then I may afterward have restitutio^ against B. upon the other
Indictment, if B. has reentred upon the first restitution made to me.

18. Dalton 194. and 195.
A. is disseised or put out with force by B. and after B. is put out with force
by C. and all this is found by one and the same Inquisition, here B. may have
restitution against C. for B. has more right to the possession than C. and
then may A. have restitution against B. but upon this Inquisition, if A. have
restitution first, then B. shall not have any restitution otherwise if these
had been found by several Inquisitions.

Who shall award and make this restitution. CHAP. 35.
1. AFter the force is found by the Enquest, the Justice of peace (before whom
the said force shall be so found) may himself put the party in possession
again, Dalton 195.
or he may make his precept under his own test alone to the Sheriff to do
it.

2. The form of the precept to the Sheriff to make restitution you may see
postea tit. of Warrants and presidents.

3. 3. Eliz. Dalis. Co. 11. 59. 65. Dyer. 187.
But no other Just. of peace has any authority by the statute to grant or
award restitution, but only he or they before whom the force was found by
Inquisition, nay the Just. of Oyer and Terminer, nor the Just. of goal
deliverie cannot grant restitution, nor the Justices of peace at their general
Sessions of the peace, cannot grant this restitution, except the indictment
were found before them.

4. And yet the Justices of the Kings Bench (in regard of their supreme
authority in all cases of the Crown) either upon certificate (to them made by
the Justice of peace, Co. 9. 118. Co. 11. 65. 4. H. 7. 18.
before whom such force was found) of the presentment of such force, or if the
said presentment or indictment shall be removed before them by Certiorari, in
both these cases the Justices of the Kings Bench may award restitution.

Dalton p. 195.
5. But neither the Iu. of the K. Bench, nor any other (besides him or them that
made the inquiry) can personally restore the party, but only by way of Precept
to the Sheriff.

6. The Sheriff, if need be may take the power of the County to execute the
precept of the Iu. of peace herein.

7. And if the Sheriff upon such a precept, or upon a writ of restitution from
the Sessions, etc. shall return that he cannot make restitution for
resistance, Dalton p. 195.
etc. he shall be amerced for making such a return, because in such case he
might have taken the power of the County to assist him therein, see the like
case Fitz. Execution 147.

To whom restitution shall be made. CHAP. 36.
1. THis restitution ought to be made to him that was put out, and to none
other, for so are the words of the statute.

P. R. ^8.
2. Therefore if a father be put out by force, and dies, his heir shall not
have restitution, Dalton p. 195.
yet here the Justices may imprison and fine the offenders, for by such
forceible Entry they have broken the peace.

3. Also if after the death of the Father, a stranger abateth or enters into
his land by force, Dalton p. 196.
before the heir has gotten actual possession indeed, the heir shall not
have restitution, because he had but a possession in law descended upon him.

4. The disseisee does put the disseisor out with force, the disseisor shall be
restored, Fitz Na Br. 248. h.
for upon an indictment of force the right or title is not disputable or
material, but by the words of the statute of 8. H. 6. ca. 9. he that is in
such sort, sc. forceibly put out shall be restored.

Dyer. 12^.
5. Yet it seems in this case, that upon traverse tendered by the disseisee,
and his right appearing, the Just. of peace may stay restitution.

Br. force 6.
6. Also if the disseisor be restored again, yet the disseisee may after
reenter peaceably or have his Assise.

7. But if the disseisee shall enter peaceably upon the disseisor, and so they
both shall abide and continue there together, Cromp. 163.
for diverse days, and after the disseisee does put out the disseisor with
force, and is thereof indicted, here it seems the disseisor shall not be
restored, for the disseisors possession was avoided in quiet manner at the
first entry of the disseisee, and so the disseisor had no possession in the eye
of Law, when he was put out.

8. If the disseisee shall enter peaceably, Cromp. 162. and 164. Dalton 196.
the disseisor and his family being abroad, and after the disseisee shall keep
his possession with force, the disseisor shall not be restored, by reason of
the eigne title of the disseisee, and for that he entered peaceably.

9. But here the disseisee shall be imprisoned and fined for keeping his
possession with force, for Forceible keeping or detaining, is as well prohibited
as Forceible Entry.

10. And here note that the being of a man's wife, children, Cromp. 164. Fitzh.
Assise 418.
of servants, in the house or upon the land do preserve his possession, but
his cattle being upon the ground, do not preserve his possession.

11. Also when two are in possession of an house, etc. and the one claims by
one title, and the other by another title, Litt. 140. Park. 45.
here the law shall adjudge him to be in possession who has the best right to
the possession; So that if A. shall wrongfully enter upon B. and they both
shall continue in the house, and after B. shall put out A. with force, A. shall
not be restored, for A. never gained any possession by his Entry.

12. Two Iointenants, or Tenants in Common, Fitz. 249. d.
and one of them does forceibly put out the other out of his possession, he
that is so expelled may have an action of Trespass of Forceible Entry against
his Companion upon the statute of 8. H. 6. and thereupon he shall have a writ
of restitution to restore him to his former estate; P. R. 39.
but it seems the Justice of peace can do nothing herein: for that his entry
and possession is lawful through the whole land in respect of his own moity
and estate.

13. Two Iointenants be put out with force, Dalton p. 197.
and one of them only sueth to have restitution, restitution shall be made unto
him.

14. Coppiholder, lessee for years, or tenant at will, 10. Carol. c. 13.
tenant by Elegit, statute merchant, or of the Staple shall have restitution by
the statute of 10. Caroli in Ireland.

15. If Lessee for years be put out of his Term by force and die, P. R. 38.
though after his death this force be found by Inquisition taken by a Justice
of peace, Dalton pa. 197.
yet his executors shall not be restored to that land (by the Justice) for that
they are not the same person which was put out.

What causes there may be for staying the Justices of peace from granting
Restitution. CHAP. 37.
1. ALthough the party, thus to be indicted for a force, Cromp. 162. Br. force
11.
shall not be heard nor suffered to give his Title in evidence, to excuse
himself of his Forceible Entry or detayner, Dalton p. 197.
to save his fine due to the King for such force, which fine he shall make
though his right be never so good, Lambert. pa. 147. 148. Dyer. 122. 9. H. 6.
fo. 19. 22. H. 6. fo. 18.
and also the Justice may proceed to the restitution (which the Complaynant
shall demand, if the force be found) without examining the title, and yet by
Dyer. fo. 122. the Justice may if he please examine the title, and thereupon
stay the awarding of restitution, but if the force be apparent I conceive the
safest way and most agreeable to the statute is to award restitution without
examining the title.

2. Now the defendant or party indicted for the stay of restitution may at the
time of the restitution to be made, plead, or allege any of these things
following:

1. His quiet possession by three years together.

2. He may deliver to the Justice of peace or Court, a Certiorari, and this is
a supersedeas to them.

3. He may show the insufficiency of the indictment if there be any.

Dalton p. 197.
4. He may plead the insufficiency of any of the Jurors, sc. for not having
Forty shillings land per annum. And in this case Master Marrow is of opinion
that the party shall have no restitution.

Three years possession.
5. For the first there shall be no restitution awarded, where the party
indicted has been in quiet possession by the space of three whole years
together next before the day of such indictment found, if his estate be not
ended, Dalton page 197. and 198.
and this the party indicted may allege to stay the restitution, and the
restitution upon this shall be stayed by the Justice of peace, until it be
tried, if the other party will deny or traverse the same.

Certiorari.
6. Also if a man who has made a forceible Entry or deteiner be in doubt that
he shall be indicted thereof before the Justice of peace upon the statute of 8.
Cromp. 164.
H. 6. and that thereupon restitution will be awarded against him, P. R. 7.
he may have a writ of Certiorari out of the Kings Bench ready, and when the
bill of indictment is found he may presently deliver it to the Justice of peace
or Court, and this is a Supersedeas to them for to stay the restitution, for
that upon this writ the said indictment shall be removed from them into the
Kings Bench. And although the indictment be found after the test of the
Certiorari, it is not material for they be both in the Kings Courts, etc.

6. H. 7. 16.
7. But if a Certiorari comes to remove an indictment: taken before the
Justice of peace in the Country, and the party will not sue to remove it,
Cromp. 166.
but suffers it to lie still, the Justice of peace may proceed to grant
restitution, notwithstanding the writ, as Hobert the Kings Attorney said in 6.
H. 7. But Keble held opinion against him, and it seems the Justices of peace
ought ex officio, to send the indictment away, because they are commanded so by
the writ, and this writ is a Supersedeas of it self to the Justice of peace to
stay their proceedings, and if they shall proceed after, it is erroneous. Br.
Judges 17.

Cromp. 162.
8. After restitution made by the Justices of peace, if the other party does
remove the indictment by a Certiorari of a more eigne date then is in the
indictment, the Justice of the Kings Bench may award restitution back again,
for upon the matter the Iu. of peace had no power to make restitution, for that
the Certiorari has relation from the date thereof.

9. Ibid.
After restitution granted from the Sessions and delivered to the Sheriff, the
other party having a Certiorari delivers it also to the Sheriff after the
Sessions, the Sheriff shall not surcease thereupon (for he has no authority
to allow thereof) but if the Certiorari were delivered to any Justice of peace
he may thereupon grant a Superdeas to the Sheriff. And if restitution were
made by the Sheriff before the said Superdeas came to his hands, then the
other party shall have restitution back again, in the Kings Bench upon the
indictment removed thither.

10. Traverse.
The tender of a traverse (to an Indictment of forceible Entry upon the statute
of 8. H. 6.) is no Supersedeas but in discretion, Dyer. 122.
so as the Justices of peace or Court may grant, or may stay the restitution at
their discretion according as the truth of the right or title shall appear to
them, and so is the use of the Kings Bench.

11. Or else the Justices of peace before whom the indictment was found, may
after Traverse tendered, certify or deliver the indictment into the Kings
Bench, and so refer the further proceedings therein to them.

12. But if the party indicted shall tender a Traverse presently, Cromp. 66^.
whereupon restitution is stayed, and after he shall not pursue his Traverse
with effect (but discontinueth it) and after does tender another traverse upon
restitution prayed at another time, the Justices of peace, or Court, shall do
well to proceed to grant restitution, notwithstanding such traverse tendered.

13. Cromp. 166.
And it is the course of the Kings Bench that he that tendreth the traverse
there upon such an Indictment, shall bear all the charges of the trial, and
not the King nor he at whose suite the Indictment was found, and the same
reason seems upon an indictment traversed before Justices of peace.

Games unlawful and Idlers. CHAP. 38.
1. Vide 12. R. 2. ca. 6. 11. H. 4. ca. 4. 17. E. 4. ca. 3.
A Justice of peace by the first Assignavimus of the Commission pro pace
conservanda and bono regimine populi, and by the common Law may arrest and
imprison all common gamesters, Idlers, and all such as be of ill fame, and the
keepers of such common gaming houses, until they shall find shall find
sureties to leave of their gaming and keeping of gaming houses, and to betake
themselves to some honest labor, or else to be of good behavior at the
discretion of the Justice.

2. Note that playing at Cards, Dice, and the like, are not prohibited by the
common laws of this Realm, except that one be deceived by false Dice, or
false Cards, and then he that is deceived may have his action of the case for
such deceit, neither are they malum in se, or of their own natures, for then
none might be tolerated or licensed to use them. And yet good Divines do hold
diverse of these recreations to be altogether unlawful, as being Actions
wherein we neither bless God, nor look to receive a blessing from God, nay
such as we dare not pray to God for a blessing on them nor on our selves in the
use thereof, but especially on the Sabbath day all such recreations and Games
are holden unlawful: for if lawful works be forbidden on that day, much more
unlawful sports, yea such sports and games, which otherwise and at other times
are lawful, See Esaias. 58.13.

Huy and Cry. CHAP. 39.
1. EVery Justice of peace may cause Huy and Cry, fresh suit and search to be
made upon any Treason, Murder, Robbery, Theft, or other felony committed, and
this he may do by force of the first Assignavimus of the Commission and the
Statute of Winchester. 13. Ed. 1. ca. 1.

13. Ed. 1. 12.
2. Note that Huy and Cry ought to be made from Town to town, and from
country to country and by horsemen and footmen, otherwise it is no lawful
pursuit, 28. Ed. 3. ca. 11.

11. Caroli c. 13. in Ireland.
3. Note also when Huy and Cry is levied upon any Robbery or other felony, the
officer of the Town where the felony was done, or Huy and Cry first levied,
ought to send to every other town round about him, and not to the next Town
only, and in such cases it is needful to give notice in writing to the
pursuers, of the things stolen, and of the color and marks thereof, as also
of the person of the Felon, his apparel and horse, etc. if it may be.

Hunting, hawking and hawks. CHAP. 40.
1. Upon information given to any Justice of peace of the County where any
unlawful hunting of Dear, or Conies, by night or with painted faces, or other
disguising, in any Forest, park, or warren, shall be had of any person to be
suspected thereof, that Justice may make a warrant to the Sheriff, 1. H. 7.
ca. 7. P. Just. 16.
Constable, Bailiffe, or other officers to take the party and to bring him
before him, or before any other Justice of peace of the same County who may
examine him of that hunting, Dalton 60.
and of the doers thereof. And if he conceal that hunting or any offender with
him therein, then the said concealment shall be felony in such concealer, but
if he then confess the truth of all that he shall be examined of, and knows
in that behalf, then his offense of hunting shall be but Trespass, and
fineable, the fine to be assessed at the next general Sessions of the peace by
the Justices there.

2. Also to disobey such a warrant, or to make rescous thereupon, 1. H. 7. ca.
7.
so that the execution of the same warrant thereby be not had, is felony.

3. The Iu. of P. that shall take the examination of an offender for unlawful
hunting in Parks, etc. as aforesaid, Dalton 66.
may after such examination, bind the offender to his good behavior, as it
seems, to the end he may be forth-comming, till the offense and residue of
the offenders be fully examined, otherwise if it shall after appear, that the
offender hath-concealed any thing whereby the offense becomes felony, then
the offender perhaps will not be found.

4. Also such unlawful hunting, if it be by three or more, Ibid.
will prove a Riot.

5. And yet hunting and hawking and such other pastimes, Co. 11. 86. 87.
every man may use upon his own lands at his pleasure, so far as they be not
restrained by Act of Parliament, but no man may make a park or warren within
his own ground without the Kings grant or license, and therefore such park or
warren made without license seem not to be within the statute of 1. H. 7. 7.

6. Whosoever finds any Hawke that is lost, and does not immediately bring
the same to the Sheriff to be proclaimed, but does imbezell the same, it is
felony. See more of Hawks before in the chapter of Felony by statute, and 34.
E. 3. ca. 21. and 37. E. 3. ca. 19.

Inrolements. CHAP. 41.
1. 10. Carol. ca. 1. in Ireland.
ANy one Justice of Peace may join with the Clerk of the Peace in taking the
inrolement of any Indenture of bargain and sale of land, etc. lying in that
County where he is Justice of peace according to the statute of 10. Caroli.

But such deed (and all other deeds to be enrolled according to this statute)
must be indented re vera, and must be enrolled within six months after the
date of the same Indenture, and if it have no date then within six months
after the delivery of the deed, or if it be enrolled, the very day of the date
of the deed, or the very last day of the six months, it is sufficient.

3. Note herein you must account 28. days to every month and not above, sc.
four weeks to the month.

4. Note also the difference, Co. 6. 62.
when a statute accompteth by the year, half year, or quarter, and when by
the month for a year, half a year, or a quarter of a year shall be
accounted according to the Calendar, and by the days in the Calendar, and not
after 28. days to the month. And a year or a twelve month (in the singular
number) includes the whole year according to the Calendar, but twelve months
(in the plural number) or eight months, Except in a quare imped. See Co. ibid.
or six months, etc. shall be accounted after eight and Twenty days to every
month, for the month by the common law of England is but eight and twenty
days: and so,

Whereas three months six months twelve months
has but 84 168 336
days.

The quarter of a year half of a year year
has 91 182 365
days.

Ter centum, ter viginti, cum quinque diebus,
Sex horas, neque plus integer Annus habet.
5. And as to these six hours, the Law gives no regard to them, and yet these
six hours, every fourth year do make a day, and so make the leap year, and
this leap year contains in it 366. days.

6. Note also for the year when in an indictment or other writing or deed it
shall be set down (or the writing shall be dated) Anno Domini 1617. it must be
accounted according to the computation of the Church of England, which
begins the year upon the 25. day of March.

Laborers, Artificers and Servants. CHAP. 42.
1. Labor and Industry is the life of a common wealth: It produces peace and
plenty, but Idleness produces rebellions, murders, thefts, breach of the
peace, Rapine, spoil, poverty, and all manner of misery, so as Idleness as
it is a great sin before God, and a breach of the royal law, so it is an
offense against the common law, and against the good government of the people,
and therefore the Justice of peace by the first Assignavimus of the Commission
ought to imprison such Idlers, until they find sureties to labor or for
their good behavior, and yet for the rooting out of Idleness and enforcing of
labor and industry diverse statutes have been made in England which are of
force in this kingdom of Ireland, which statutes I shall here express in
order of time, and first in 23. Ed. 3. c. 1. It was enacted that

hard it is to limit in certain what wages Servants at Husbandry should take by
the year, and other Artificers and Laborers by the day, by reason whereof
they now ask and take unreasonable wages within the land of Ireland. For
reformation whereof, be it enacted by authority of this present Parliament,
that the Justice of peace, in every County within this land of Ireland, yearly
in their Sessions to be holden within one month next after the Feast of
Easter, and one month next after the Feast of Saint Michael the Archangell,
shall make Proclamations by their discretion having respect to such prices, as
victuals, cloth, and other necessaries then shall be at, how much every Mason,
Carpenter, Sclauter, and every other Artificer, and Labourer, shall take by the
day as well in harvest season as any other time of the year, with meat and
drink, and how much without meat and drink, betwixt both the said Sessions.
And also at the Sessions to be holden next after the Feast of Easter how much
every servant at Husbandry shall take by the year following with meat and
drink, and that every of them shall obey such Proclamations from time to time,
as a thing made and established by Act of Parliament for a law in that behalf
upon pain of forfeiture every one of the said Carpenters, Sclauters,
Artificers, Laborers, and Servants, that shall take any thing contrary to the
said Proclamation or Proclamations, the thing so taken, and imprisonment of
their bodies, by the discretion of the said Justices, and that Justices of
peace at any Sessions, shall enquire, hear, and determine the same offenses,
and thalffendell of the said forfeiture to be to the Kings highness, and the
other half to him or them that shall give information of the same forfeiture,
and that all and every Act before this time made concerning the limitation of
wages for the said Servants, Artificers, and Laborers, be in that point only
void and of none effect within this land, and this Act to endure till the next
Parliament within this land to be holden.

11. Eliz. ca. 5. in Ireland.
26. Which statute by another Act of Parliament made in Ireland in Anno 11.
Eliz. cap. 5. is made perpetual.

27. And having now set forth the statutes concerning Laborers, Artificers,
and Servants, it will be necessary for the better information of the Justices
of peace to make some exposition of the said statute of 23. Ed. 3. which is the
ground of all the rest, which I shall briefly do in these eight particulars
following:

1. First, what the common Law was concerning Laborers, Artificers, and
Servants, before the said statute.

2. Secondly, who are compellable to labor by the said statute of 23. Ed. 3.

3. What is a good retainer, within that statute, and what not.

4. What be good causes for a servant to depart from his service within his
Term, and what not.

5. How and in what manner the master may discharge the servant, apprentice, or
other Artificer of his service.

6. Sixthly, who may lawfully take a servant out of the service of his master
with whom he is retained, without the danger of the said statute.

7. Seventhly, In what cases a man may receive or retain a servant that is
formerly retained by another.

8. And lastly, who shall in Law be taken to be a servant within the meaning of
the said statute of 23. Ed. 3.

The common Law before the statutes.
28. For the First, by the common Law before the said statutes, a Justice of
peace by the first Assignavimus of the Commission pro bono regimine, might
commit to prison all Idle wanderers which were able to work and would not
(which had no means or livelihood of their own) to remain in prison until
they should find surety either to betake themselves to some honest labor, or
else to be bound to their good behavior, and this is agreeable to the Law of
God as appears in the second Epistle of Saint Paul to the Thessalonians the
third Chapter, where Saint Paul gives a commandment and a precept, that if
any would not work he should not eat, (that is) he should not eat the fruit
of other men's labors, but should work and eat his own bread and it is
plain and manifest in the kingdom of Ireland, that Idleness has been the
chief occasion of many rebellions, and yet is a great occasion of the poverty
of that kingdom, and for the better suppressing of all such Idle living
diverse good Laws and statutes have been enacted and made in that kingdom as
namely in Anno. 25. H. 6. ca. 7. It was enacted that the Sons of Husbandmen
and Laborers should be Laborers and travelers upon the ground, as they were
in old time, and in all other works and labors lawful and honest, according
to their state, and if it fortune that any such son of an Husbandman or of a
Labourer do the contrary, and thereof be lawfully convicted before any Judge
of the King, or Judge of Franchise, that he shall have the imprisonment of one
year, and over that he shall make fine to the King, or to the Lord of the
Franchise, according to the discretion of the Judge before whom he is convicted.

29. 11. Caroli c. 16.
And by another sta^ute lately made in Ireland in the eleventh year of the
Kings Majesty that now is. It is enacted that if any person or persons that
has no means of ability of his own, or sufficient means of support from his
parents and kindred, that shall walk up and down the Country with their
Fosterers or kindred and retinue with one or more Greyhound or Greyhounds or
otherwise, or that shall casher, lodge or sesse themselves, their followers,
their horses, or their Greyhounds upon the Inhabitants of the Country, or
shall directly or indirectly exact meat, drink, or money from them, or shall
crave any helps in such sort as the poor people dare not deny the same for
fear of some scandalous Rhyme or song to be made upon them, or some worse
inconvenience to be done them, that it shall be lawful for every Justice of
peace of each County within the Realm of Ireland, and for the Justices of
Assise in their several Circuits, to apprehend or cause to be apprehended all
such person or persons, and him or them to bind to their loyalty and
allegiance or allegeances, or to the good behavior, as in the discretion of
such Justices shall seem meet, and to commit the said persons to the common
jail of the said County, until he or they shall find bonds by recognisance
as aforesaid, with very good sureties, which the Justice of peace shall return
all and every such Bonds or Recognisances, so by him to be taken, at the next
general Sessions of the peace for the said County, where the same shall be
taken, and all Sheriffs, Bailiffes, Constables, Provost Marshals, and other
his Majesty's loyal subjects are required to be ayding, assisting and helpful
to every Justice of peace and Justices of Assize in the apprehending of the
said Cosherers, and wandering Idlers, when they shall be thereunto required upon
pain of such fine or fines to be set upon them, for their neglect, as upon
conviction before the Justices of peace or before the Justices of Assise at
their discretion shall be set upon them for their said default.

30. Both which last mentioned statutes are in a manner but a declaration of
the common Law, for the constant course in Ireland has ever been at the
general Sessions of the peace and at the Assizes to enquire of such Idlers,
and to fine and imprison them, until they shall find surety to betake
themselves to some honest labor, or else to be bound to their good behavior
at the discretion of the Judge.

31. So likewise at the common Law, if a man had taken my servant from me, I
might have had an action of Trespass, Quare vi and armis, etc. but if he had
procured the servant to depart, who did depart accordingly and he retained him,
or if he had departed of his own head, and another had retained him knowing of
the first retainer, an Action did not lie at the common Law, Quare vi and
armis, etc. but an action upon the case did lie upon the departure by such
procurement, and in case where the servant did depart without any such
procurement and was retained by another, 11. H. 4. 21. and 22.
there no action at all did lie by the common Law, and therefore the said
statute of 23. Ed. 3. was made, which gives an action in these cases. 11. H. 4.
21. and 22.

Co. lib. 11. fo. 86.
32. Likewise by the common Law no man may be prohibited to work in any lawful
trade, for the Law abhors Idleness, Coke lib. 11. fo. 86.

33. Also by the common Law no man is prohibited to use diverse mysteries or
Trades at his pleasure, and although this was prohibited by the statute of 37.
Ed. 3. cap. 6. yet shortly after at the next Parliament (that restraint of free
Trade being found prejudicial to the common wealth) it was enacted again that
all persons should be as free to use several Trades as they were at anytime
before, Co. lib. 11. fo. 54.
as appears by the statute of 38. Ed. 3. ca. 2. and therefore without an Act
of Parliament no man may be restrained either to work in any lawful Trade or
to use diverse mysteries or Trades, by any ordinances or by-lawes made to
restrain the same, but such by-lawes and ordinances are merely void and
against the law.

34. Also it is lawful for any person to use privately any Trade, as of a
Cook, Brewer, Baker, Tailor, or such like, in his own house, or in the house
of any other, for the private use of the family, although such person were
never Apprentice to the Trade.

Who are compellable to serve by the statute.
35. By the statute of 23. Ed. 3. and the rest of the statutes above mentioned,
a Justice of peace may command vagrant persons to prison if they will not serve
and labor, and they may command the Jailer to let them at large without other
writ, Fitz Na. Br. fo. 168. b.
and if a man be retained in service and go vagrant out of his service another
man may compel him to serve or labor, because he is out of service, Fitz. Na.
Br. fo. 168 b.

Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 168. 1.
36. He which has not lands sufficient of his own to manure or has not some
mystery or occupation to live upon, shall be compelled to serve and labor by
the said statute of 23. Ed. 3. Fitz. Na. Br. fol. 168. i.

37. In an action upon the statute of Laborers the defendant says that he
holds land, for which he ought to do certain days works yearly to the
Bishop of D. at his Manor of S. and demands Judgment if he shall be compelled
to serve, and the plaintiff says that he had but six acres for which he shall
pay but six days work, upon which the defendant demurred in law, and it was
awarded by the Court that the plaintiff shall be barred of his action, the
reason is, 40. Ed. 3. 39.
that if he shall be retained with another, it will not be lawful for him to
depart from him to do the six days work, Brook Lab. 5.
nor to do any work, 40. Ed. 3. 39. Brook Laborers 5.

38. An Infant of the age of five years is not compellable to serve by the
said statute by reason of his disability of body, 41. Ed. 3. 17. Brook Lab. 6.
for the statute requires that he should be potens in corpore. 41. Ed. 3. 17.
Brook Laborers 6.

39. In an action of false imprisonment the defendant justifies (being Lord of
the tenant) because the plaintiff was vagrant, and I.N. complained for lack of
a servant, and required him to serve, and he would not, wherefore he put him in
the Stocks, and the plaintiff said that he had two Acres of land, five sheep
and ten Cowes to the value of 20. l. to be occupied, and the defendant said
that he had but a cottage and no land, and so not sufficient to be occupied,
and the other said and maintained that he had sufficient Chattels to be
occupied, and thereupon the issue was joined, 47. Ed. 3. 18. Br. Lab. 14.
which proves that if his Chattels were sufficient to employ him in labor, he
is not compellable to serve as a servant. 47. Ed. 3. 18. Br. Lab. 14.

40. An action was brought upon the statute of Laborers against a little
Damsel of the age of ten years upon retainer and departure, and the
plaintiff declared against her, and the defendant said that she is but of the
age of Ten years, and demanded Judgment of action, and because it appeared to
the Court by inspection that she was not of age to make a Covenant, therefore
the writ was abated, 2. H. 4. 5. Br. Lab. 19.
and there Rickhill said that she is not of age to bind herself by Covenant,
ante annos nubiles, that is to say before the age of 12. years, 2. H. 4. 5.
Br. Lab. 19.

41. In an action upon the statute of Laborers, 7. H 4. 5. Br. Lab. 20.
it was said that the statute of Anno. 23. Ed. 3. cap. 1. is, that quilibet
potens in corpore ought to serve, and by Hankford an Infant of 12. years
retained ought to serve 7. H. 4. 5. Br. Lab. 20.

42. A man brought an Action upon the statute of Laborers for taking his
servant out of his possession, 38. Ed. 3. 5. Br. Lab. 24.
the defendant said that the servant is an Infant under the age of Ten years,
and because the plaintiff could not gainsay it, he was barred of his action,
38. Ed. 3. 5. Br. Lab. 24.

43. An Artificer as a Carpenter, Tailor, Shooemaker, and such like shall not
be compelled to serve by the statute of husbandry, contrary of servants of
husbandry, and therefore in an action of debt brought by the Carpenter,
Tailor, or such like for his wages, the master may wage his law, but not in an
action brought by a servant in husbandry, and yet if a Carpenter, Tailor,
Shooemaker, 33. H. 6. 14. Br. Lab. 36.
or other Artificer will be retained in service and depart, an action lies of
the departure, although that they shall not be constrained to serve; for the
first Article of the statute of Laborers 23. Ed. 3. compels servants of
husbandry to serve, and the second Article ordaines that if any retained in
service depart from his master, an Action shall lie of the Departure, 33. H. 6.
14. Brook, Laborers 36.

44. In an action upon the statute of Laborers, if the defendant were vagrant,
and was required to serve, and refused; by Martin, if he be retained with one
to serve by the day, and is required by another to serve by the year, there he
shall serve the first the day which he was hired, and after that day ended he
shall serve the other by the year; but if he be retained for twenty or forty
days, and be required by another to serve by the year, he ought to serve the
latter, for a retainer by twenty or forty days is no usual retainer, but
otherwise it is of a retainer by the day, 11. H. 6. 1. Br. Lab. 49.
and by him if a man be retained for a year, and after is vagrant, and do not
serve accordingly, there; if another him require to serve he ought to obey that
request. 11. H. 6. 1. Brook, Laborers 49.

45. A servant shall be compelled to serve in Summer in the place where he
served in Winter before, and the Lords of the Town and Justices of peace may
command vagrants to prison which will not serve, Fitz. Na. Br. fo 168 f. Br.
Lab. 51.
and if a man retain a servant for forty days, and another retain him for a
year within the forty days, the first retainer is thereby discharged, because
the first retayner was not according to the statute, What is a good retainer
within the statute and what not. 3. H. 6. 23. Br. Lab. 1.
Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 168. f. Br. Lab. 51.

46. If a man retain a Labourer to serve him in husbandry according to the
form of the statute, this is a good retainer, although no wages be mentioned,
but it is otherwise if a man retain a Carpenter to make a Mill, or such like,
for in the one case the wages is certain by the statute and not in the other.
3. H. 6. 23. Br. Lab. 1.

47. An Action upon the statute of Laborers was brought against one which was
retained in the office of an Imbroiderer who departed within the Term, 47. Ed.
8. ^^. Br. Lab. 15.
the defendant demands Judgment of writ, because the statute does extend only
to servants and laborers and not to Artificers, but this exception was not
allowed, whereby it appears that this was a good retainer according to the
statute 47. E. 3. 22. Br. Lab. 15.

48. An Action upon the statute of Laborers was brought against a Chaplain
who had covenanted to be Seneschall to the plainetiffe, and Chaplain of such a
parish Church, for that he departed within the Term, and as to the office of
Seneschall it was adjudged that the Action is well brought, 50. Ed. 3. 13. Br.
Lab. 16.
but as to the Chaplain the Action does not lie, for that he is neither common
Labourer, nor Artificer, but is the servant of God, and therefore as to that he
was discharged. 50. E. 3. 13. Br. Lab. 16. 11. H. 4. 42. Br. Lab. 23.


49. A retainer upon condition is a good retainer within the said statute. ^8.
Ed. ^. 12. Br. Lab. 25. Fitz Na. Br. fo. 138. h.
11. H. 4. 42. Br. Lab. 23.

50. If a man that is insufficient and not able to keep a servant retain a
servant to serve him by the year, this is no good retainer. 38. Ed. 3. 12. Br.
Lab. 25.

51. An Action upon the statute of Laborers was brought, and the defendant
said that he was retained to collect the rents of the plaintiff without that,
that he was retained in the office of a labourer, and this was adjudged a good
plea; for the statute is only of those which may be required to serve as
Laborers, 19. H. 6. 53. Br. Lab. 28.
and that is not a Collector of rents, for it is not reasonable that a man
should be compelled to be accomptable. 19. H. 6. 53. Br. Lab. 28.

52. If a man retain a servant to serve in his house, 21. H. 6. 9. Br. Lab. 29.
that is a good retainer, although he do not express in what office he shall
serve, that is to say a fervant in Husbandry, Cook, Butler, horsekeeper, or
such like. 21. H. 6. 9. Br. Lab. 29.

53. By Markham and Ascue Justices, an Infant may bind himself a Prentice, but
Newton and Paston Justices say, that is by custom and not by the common Law,
and it is there agreed that one may be constrained by the statute to serve but
not to be an Apprentice, and by Paston, if an Infant be retained to serve, and
an Action upon the statute of Laborers is brought against him, it is a good
plea for him to say that he is an Infant, but by Markham that is; 21. H. 6. 33.
Br. Lab. 30.
where he is under the age of 14. years; for at the age of 14. years he is
potens in corpore according to the statute, and therefore such retainer is
good. 21. H. 6. 33. Br. Lab. 30.

54. If I retain a servant for a year, and so from year to year, taking for
his wages according to the statute, and if he serve Eight years he shall have
an Action for his wages, and he may not depart without reasonable warning, but
where he is retained for one year and continues for Eight or Ten years, now
the first retainer shall serve for all, and is but one retainer within the
statute for all the years. 38. H. 6. 14. Br. Lab. 36. 38. H. 6. 14. Br. Lab.
36.


55. If I retain a servant to serve me by the year at any time that I shall
require him; this is no good retainer within the statute. 22. H. 6. 30. Br.
Lab. 31. 22. H. 6. 30. Br. Lab. 31.


56. An Action upon the statute of Laborers for taking of the plainetiffes
retained servant, the defendant said that the servant made the Covenant by
dures and was within age, and the defendant had 20. l. land, and the servant is
his Son and heir apparent, and by Babington if such a son make a Covenant
to serve, this is a good retainer, although he were heir apparent to 100. l.
land. And if he were of the age of discretion and made such a Covenant to serve
in Husbandry, that shall bind him, and so it was agreed by the Court, and there
it was said by Martin that a man may lawfully be imprisoned if he will not
serve according to his Covenant, but this shall be by the officers of the King
and not by the party himself. 9. H. 6. 10. Br. Lab. 43. 9. H. 6. 10. Br. Lab.
43.


57. If a labourer be retained to serve for Term of his life, this is no good
retainer within the statute. 2. H. 4. 15. Br. Lab. 44. 2. H. 4. 15. Br. Lab. 44.


58. Note that he which is non potens in corpore and he which has lands and a
Gentleman, Cook, Butler, Chaplain, Yeoman, and such like shall not be
constrained by the statute to be retained in Husbandry, yet if they will be
retained in Husbandry; this retainer is good. 38. H. 6. 22. Br. Lab. 46. 38. H.
6. 22. Br. Lab. 46.


59. The retainer of a Chaplain to serve as a Chaplain is no good retainer
within the said statute, nor no Action will lie for his departure upon the said
statute, for it is intended that he has whereof to live, although he be not
always disposed to celebrate divine service. 10. H. 6. 8. Br. Lab. 47. 10. H
6. 8. Br. Lab. 47.


60. If a man retain an Infant of the age of 12. years or upward be it man or
woman to serve in Husbandry; this is a good retainer by the said statute, Fitz.
Na. Br. fol. 168. d. F tz Na. Br. fo. 168. d.


61. If a Gentleman which by the statute is not compellable to serve in
Husbandry, or a Chaplain, or a Carpenter shall put themselves by Covenant to
serve in Husbandry, they shall be bound thereby, and this is a good retainer by
this statute, and upon their departure out of such service an Action lies
against them upon this statute, Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 168. e. Fitz. Na Br. fo. 168.
e.


62. If a man retain one for forty days to serve him and another after
retain him for a year, the first retainer is defeated, because it was not
according to the statute; and so if one be retained to serve at every time that
he shall be required, that is no retainer according to the statute, but if it
be by deed, it is a good Covenant upon the deed, and without deed it is void,
Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 168. f. Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 168. f.


63. If a man retain another to serve him and do not express how long he
shall serve; this is a good retainer according to the statute, and he shall
serve a year, Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 168. h. Fitz Na. Br. fo. 168. h.


Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 168. o.
64. If the husband and wife be retained during the marriage, this is a good
retainer, and if they depart an Action shall be maintained against them upon
the said statute.

What be causes for a servant to depart from his service.
65. The detaining of competent meat, drink, lodging, or wages from a servant
are good causes to depart from his service, Fitz. Na. Br. 168. l.

F^tz Na. Br. fo. 168 l. and q. 29. Ed. 3. 22. Br. Lab. 35.
66. Also if the master or his wife without cause beat the servant or
otherwise for cause beat him outragiously, these are good causes for the
servant to depart, and yet the master by Law is allowed with moderation to
chastise his servant or apprentice, Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 168. l. and q.

67. Also the servant may depart by the license of his master, Fitz. Na. Br.
fo. 168. l.

68. But if a woman which is a servant take a husband, this is no cause to
depart from her service, but she ought to serve out the residue of her Term,
Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 168. n. Fitz. Na Br. fo. 168. n.


69. If the master will discharge his servant by word and say unto him that he
shall serve him no longer, this is a good cause for the servant to depart, 6.
Ed. 4. 2. Br. Lab. 38.
for he cannot serve him against his will, but upon such discharge the servant
shall have his wages for the time he has served, 6. Ed. 4. 2. Br. Lab. 38.

70. How a master may discharge his servant.
In an Action upon the statute of Laborers for departing from his service the
defendant said that he was retained with the plainetiffe in the office of
Carpenter to make a house, and that he came unto him to do his service, and
the master him discharged, and this was holden to be a good bar of the
Action. 11. H. 4. 32. Br. Lab. 22. 11. H. 4. 32. Br. Lab. 22.


71. In an Action of maintenance the defendant justifies to aid the
plaintiff, because he was his retained servant, and the plaintiff said that
after the retainer and before the maintenance, that is to say, at D. in the
County of M. the master him discharged of his service whereunto the servant
agreed, whereby it appears that the master may not discharge his servant
within the Term, except that the servant agree thereunto no more, then the
servant may depart from his Master without the masters license or agreement.
19. H. 6. 30. Br. Lab. 27. 19. H. 6. 30. Br. Lab. 27.


72. If a man retain a servant for a year and he discharge him at Easter in
the same year, to which the servant agrees, he shall not have an Action for
any part of his wages for the service done before nor after, for nothing is due
until the end of the year, for the contract is entire and may not be severed.
10. H. 6. 23. Br. Lab. 48. 10. H. 6. 23. Br. Lab. 48.
otherwise it is if the servant be within age, for then his agreement to the
discharge is void, and he shall not be bound by it.

73. If a servant that is retained for a year happen within the time of his
service to fall sick, or to be hurt or lamed, or otherwise to become non
potens in corpore, the master must not put such servant away nor abate any part
of his wages for such time, Dalton page 74. Dalton pa. 74.


74. Who may take a servant from his master that retained him.
74. The Lord may take his villain out of the service of another if he have
need of servants, otherwise not, Fitzh. Na. Br. 168. m.

75. In an Action upon the statute of Laborers for taking a servant out of his
masters service, the defendant said that he is seized of the Manor of B. to
which the servant was a villain reguardant, wherefore he took him, etc. and
this was holden no good plea, for where a villain is retained in another
service, it is not lawful for the Lord to take him from his master, unless
the Lord have need of such a servant, whereupon the defendant said that the
servant was a Shepherd, and that he having need of a Shepherd took him, and
this was holden to be a good plea, for the statute will that the Lords should
be preferred in their villains before others. 27. H. 6. 2. Br. Lab. 3. 27. H.
6. 2. Br. Lab. 3.


76. In an Action upon the statute of Laborers for taking his servant retained
out of his service, the defendant said that he is Lord of the Manor of W. to
which this servant was and is a villain reguardant, and is a Carter, and he
has need of a Carter, 47. Ed. 3. 16. Br. Lab. 13.
by reason whereof he took him, and this was held to be a good justification,
for the Statute of Laborers, viz. the statute of 23. Ed. 3. ca. 1. and 2. is
quod domini preferantur in nativis suis, 47. Ed. 3. 16. Br. Lab. 13.

50. Ed. 3. 22. Br. L^b. 17.
77. If a man retain a servant which is the villain or retained servant of
another, the Lord or the master that first retained him may take him out of the
possession of him that last retained him, 9. H. 4. 32. Br. Lab. 33.
but before he take him he ought to give notice of his former retainer, or of
the villenage. 50. Ed. 3. 22. Br. Lab. 17.

2. H. 4. 13. Br. Lab. 18.
78. If a man have a feme sole in his service, and another man takes her to
wife, he may do that lawfully, but it is not lawful for him to take her out of
her service during the term that she is bound to serve, 2. H. 4. 13. Br. Lab
18.

Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 168. d.
79. If a man takes an Infant or other servant out of another man's service,
this is punishable, though the Infant or servant was not retained, but if an
Infant being retained as an Apprentice, or servant happen to be a Ward, the
Lord may take him from his master; for the Lords title is more ancient then the
retainer, yet the Lord ought first to give notice thereof to his master, or
else the master may lawfully detain him, 50. Ed. 3. 22. Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 143.
i. 50. Ed. 3. 22. Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 143. i.


80. If a servant be retained by one, and depart from his master, and then is
retained by another, it is lawful for the first master to take him out of the
possession of the second master, so as he give notice to the second master of
the former retainer, 28. H. 6. 11. Br. Lab. 4. 28. H. 6. 11. Br. Lab. 4.


81. If a man retain the servant of another, not knowing of the former
retainer, Who may receive or retain a servant that is retained with another.
he shall not be punished for this, if he do not detain him after notice of
it, Fitz. Na. Br. fol. 168. b.

82. A servant departs from his master, and one that had married his mother
found him vagrant, and the servant came with him to his house and continued
there a day, the father in law for this is not punishable by the statute: And
likewise in this case, if the father had brought the servant to a schoolmaster
to be taught, and the schoolmaster receive him into his school, this is no
offense in the schoolmaster, for he is not bound to take notice that he was in
service: And also if a servant have broken his leg or Arm, or received any
other hurt that he cannot go, and a Surgeon comes to him to cure his wound,
this is no offense in the Surgeon, or if a servant come unto me and pray me to
receive him into my service, which I do, this is no offense in me, for I am
not bound to take notice of the former retainer; And likewise if a servant come
to me, and entreat me for Gods sake to give him lodging, which I do
accordingly, this is justifiable, and no offense against this statute, for it
is an Act of Charity. And likewise if the servant of another man comes to
labor with me, his master shall have no action against me for this cause, but
if I procure him to come and labor with me knowing him to be the servant of
another man, Who shall be said in Law a servant within the statute of 23. Ed. 3.
I shall be punished by this statute. 9. H. 4. 32. Br. Lab. 33. 9. H 4. 32.

83. He which is retained to serve, although he never come to his master, nor
be actually in his service, he is a servant within the intention of this
statute, and if he be retained and refuse to do his labor, this is a
departure in law, and punishable by this statute, 41. Ed. 3. 20. Br. Lab. 7.

statute, 45. Ed. 3. 13. Br. Lab. 8. 21. H. 6. 33. Br. Lab. 30. 39. Ed. 3. 22.

85. A Chaplain retained to say divine service is no servant within the
meaning of the statute 46. Ed. 3. 14. Br. Lab. 10.

86. I have the more enlarged my self upon this title of Laborers, because I
see by continual experience that not only the Idleness of those that will
not labor, but also the excessive wages of such as do labor, and of all
manner of artificers is the most great and general grievance that is in
Ireland, and thereupon all these inconveniences do ensue: videlicet, first, of
Idleness ensues Thefts and Rebellions, for Idleness is the nurse of both.
Secondly, of the excess of wages in servants and laborers in husbandry
ensues poverty in the farmors and freehoulders that live by husbandry only,
for the excess of servants and laborers wages eats up the greatest part of
the profit that may be raised by manuring the land, whereby the farmor is so
impoverished that he is not able to pay his rent, and to bear other country
charges, nor to enclose his land, or to live and breed his children in any
decent fashion, by means whereof the land is not improved to the one half of
the value it might be at, and so the Landlords loose a great part of their
revenue, besides the preventing of many stealthes which could not be so
frequently committed as now they are, if the lands were enclosed. Thirdly, by
the excess of wages in Masons, Carpenters, and other artificers, the farmors
and inferior freeholders are constrained for the most part to live in base
cottages more fit for hogstyes then for men to dwell in, and no marvel for by
the negligence of the Justices of peace in not rating of wages and putting
these statutes in execution it is come to this pass that a Ioyner will take
Two shillings sterling per diem with meat and drink for his Iourneyman, and
12. d. sterling with meat and drink, for a boy that can scarce bore a hole as
it should be; and this I speak of mine own knowledge, and therefore I wish
that the Justices of peace would henceforth better remember their oaths, the
duty of their places, and the good of the common wealth then hitherto they have
done, but if the Justices of peace shall wilfully continue still their neglect
herein, I cannot but let them know, that for this their neglect they are (and
that worthily) for their neglect to be punished in the Starchamber.

Misprision. CHAP. 43.
1. THere be also certain offenses which by the common Law are misprision of
treason or felonies, or at least punishable in the same degree and more, 22.
Ed. 3. 13. Stamf. 38.
as to draw a sword to stricke a Justice, sitting in place of Judgment; to
strike a Iuror in the presence of the Just. sitting in place of judgment,
Stam. 37. and 38. Br. contempts 9. 0.
or to stricke another in the house where the Courts of Justice are kept,
sitting any of the Kings Courts there, or to draw any weapons (therewithal to
strike any person) in the presence of the Justices, P. Pain 16.
or to make any Affray in their presence they sitting in Judgment, or to
rescous any such offender, these are such misprisions for which the offendour
shall have more grievous punishment then for misprisions of Treason or felony,
for in these cases the offender shall not only forfeit all his goods and
chattels, and the profits of his lands during his life, and be imprisoned
during his life, but also shall have his hand cut of.

28. El. ca. 7. in Ireland.
2. The counterfeiting of the coin of gold or silver of other Countries, which
is not current in this Kingdom, is by a statute made in 28. Eliz. ca. 7.
enacted to be misprision of high treason in the Actors, their procurers,
ayders, and abettors.

Stamf. 37. d. Cromp. 44.
3. Note that every treason or felony, do include misprision, so that where any
person has committed treason or felony, the King may cause the offender to be
indicted and arraigned but of misprision.

Stamf. fo. 37.
4. Misprision of Treason or felony is properly when one knows that another
has committed, or is about to commit any treason or felony, but was not, or is
not consenting thereto, and yet will not discover the offender to the King or
his Council, or to some Magistrate, but conceales both the offense and the
offenders.

Br. Treason. 19. Stamf. fo. 38.
5. For misprision of treason, the offend or shall forfeite to the King all his
goods and chattels for ever, and the profits of his lands during his life, and
also shall be imprisoned during his life, but for misprision of felony the
offender shall be only fined and ransomed as it seems, 3. H. 7. 10. Br.
Treason 25.
and shall be committed to prison until he has paid his fine. 3. H. 7. fol.

6. Note for the offenders in high treason, misprision of treason and
praemunire, that although the Iu. of Peace by their Commission nor by statute
cannot meddle with them in the very point of their offenses, saving in some
particulars, and that by way of inquiry only, which you may see hic antea tit.
felony, yet for that all treasons and such other offenses are against the peace
of the King and of the Realm, therefore upon complaint made to the Justice of
peace, or other knowledge had by him of any such offenders, it shall be his
part to cause such offenders to be apprehended, and to take their examinations,
and the information upon oath of such as bring them or of others that can prove
any thing material against them, and to put the same in writing (under the
hands of the Informers) and then to commit the offenders to the Jail, Dalton
p. 212.
and also to bind over by recognisance all such as do declare any thing
material, to appear and give evidence against such offenders, before the
Lords of the Kings Majesty's privy Council, or elsewhere, when they shall be
called upon reasonable warning, or before the Justices of Assizes at the next
general jail delivery, and after to certify their doing therein to some of
the Lords of his Majesty's said Council.

Nightwalkers. CHAP. 44.
1. EVery Justice of peace (ex officio) and by the first Assignavimus of the
Commission may cause to be arrested all Nightwalkers, 13. H. 7. 1^. Dalton pa.
76.
be they strangers or other persons that be suspected, or that be of evil
behavior, or of evil fame, and more particularly all such suspected persons
as shall sleep in the day time, and go abroad in the night season, haunt any
house that is suspected for bawdery, or shall in the night time use other
suspicious company, or shall commit any other outrages or misdemeanors, and may
force them to find surety for their good behavior, see the title, surety for
the good behavior.

Peace. CHAP. 45.
1. EVery Justice of peace has authority and power given him, by the first
Assignavimus, or clause in the Commission, Dalton pa. 79.
to keep and cause to be kept the Kings majesty's peace, by force of which
words they have as well the ancient power touching the keeping of the peace
which the ancient conservators of the peace had by the common Law, as also all
authority which the statutes since have added thereto, and so they may cause to
be kept all the statutes and Laws now in force, which been made for the peace
or keeping thereof, and more especially they may arrest or cause to be arrested
and sent to the Jail all Traitors, Murderers, Robbers, and Felons, and
persons suspected of such things, and all such are guilty of any misprision, or
praemunire.

2. They may also suppress and bind to the peace or good behavior all
Affrayors, Dalton p. 80.
and all persons unlawfully and riotously assembled or unlawfully wearing
armor or any weapons, by night or by day, or otherwise putting the people in
fear and all unlawful nightwalkers and barrettors, and the like, all which
may well be said to be disturbances or breaches of the peace, see more fully of
these under their particular Titles.

Posse Comitatus. CHAP. 46.
1. Where the Justice of peace, Sheriff, or other officer is enabled to take
the power of the County, it seems they may command, and ought to have the
help and attendance of all Knights, Gentlemen, Yeomen, Husbandmen, Laborers,
Tradesmen, Servants, and Apprentices, and of all other such persons, being
above the age of fifteen years, and that are able to travel.

2. But women, Ecclesiastical persons, and such as be decrepit or diseased of
any continual infirmity, shall not be compelled to attend them.

3. And in such cases, it is referred to the discretion of the Justices of
peace, or Sheriff, etc. what number they will have to attend upon them, and
how and after what manner they shall be armed, weaponed, and otherwise
furnished.

4. But it is not justifiable for the Justices of peace, Sheriff, or other
officer, to assemble posse comitatus or raise a power or assembly of people
(upon their own heads) without just cause.

What persons may take posse comitatus and in what ^ases. CHAP. 47.
Dalton 314.
1. ANy Justice of peace or Sheriff, may take of that County where he is a
Justice or Sheriff, any number that they shall think meet, to pursue,
apprehend, arrest and imprison Traitors, Murderers, Robbers, and other felons,
or such as do break, or go about to break, or disturb the Kings peace, and
every man being required, ought to assist and aid them.

2. The Justice of peace and Sheriff, or undersheriffe may take posse
comitatus, Dalton ibid.
for the suppressing of riots, and all sorts of persons (being able and
required) ought to assist them therein.

14. H. 7. 8.
3. Yea any one Justice of peace may take the power and aid of the whole
Country to suppress Rioters, and needs not to tarry for the coming of
another Justice, or of the Sheriff.

Dalton 314.
4. Also in cases of forceible entry any Justice of peace may take posse
comitatus to remove such persons as by his view, or by inquisition taken before
him, shall be found to have made any forceible entry (into other men's
possessions) or to detain them with force.

5. The Sheriff, Undersheriffe, or Bailiffe, etc. if need be, may by the common
Law, take the power of the County (what number they shall think good) to
execute the Kings process or writ, be it a writ of execution, replevin,
estreperment, capias or other writ, it being the Kings commandment (see also
the statute Westminster. 1. 17. Westminster. 2. 39.) and such as shall not assist them
therein, being required, shall pay a fine to the King.

6. 3. H. 7. 1. Br. Trespass 266.
The Sheriffs Bailiffe to execute a Replevin took with him three hundred men
armed (modo guerino) with brigandines, jacks, and guns, and it was holden
lawful, for the Sheriffs officer has power to take assistance as well as the
Sheriff himself, for that all is one office and one authority.

7. Dalton 324.
A man demands the peace in the Chancery against a great Lord, and has a
supplicavit directed to the Sheriff, there if need shall be, the Sheriff may
take his posse comitatus to aid him to arrest such a Lord, etc.

8. So it seems, if a supplicavit be directed to a Justice of peace, Dalton
ibid.
the Justice of peace or the officer to whom the Justice of peace shall make
his warrant in this behalf (upon resistance made) may if need be take posse
comitatus to aid him to arrest the party, quia quando, Co. li. 5. fo. 115.
aliquid mandatur, mandatur and omne per quod pervenitur ad illud. Co. 5. 115.

9. The Sheriff may take Posse comitatus to apprehend felons, etc. or
disturbers of the Peace.

10. So he may take Posse comitatus to execute the precept of the Justice of
Peace.

11. 3. H 7. 10. 1^. H. 7 19. B^. Trespass^ 432.
The Constable of the Town upon a treason or felony committed, or upon any
affray or the like, may take the aid of his neighbors, or other persons being
present, to apprehend the Traitor or felons, or to cause the peace to be kept,
and to carry the offenders before the Just. of peace.

12. One has hurt another, whereby he is in peril of death, 38. Ed (...)
the Constable may take power or aid to arrest him that did the hurt.

Praemunire. CHAP. 48.
1. EVery Justice of peace may cause all such as are suspected to have fallen
into the danger of a Praemunire to be arrested and to commit the offender upon
probable proof thereof, and this he may do by the first assignavimus of the
Commission, for nothing can be more against the peace and good government then
bringing in and extolling of foreign Jurisdictions and authority, and
therefore it will be needful to inform the Justices of peace what offenses by
the laws and statutes of force in Ireland will bring a man into the danger of
a Praemunire.

2. At the common law before the statute of 25. Ed. 3. de proditionibus, the
extolling of foreign Jurisdiction was Treason, but by that statute the law is
altered, and as well in that Parliament as in many other parliaments several
provisions have been made against offenders of this kind, the substance and
effect of which statutes are here expressed as follows, videlicet:

Rome. Abbeys. Priories.
3. In anno 25. E. 3. c. 22. It is ordained that because that some do purchase
in the Court of Rome provisions to have Abbeys, and Priories in the Kings
Dominions in destruction of the Realm, and holy Religion, every man that
purchases such provisions of Abbeys or Priories, that he and his Executors
Executors.
and Procurators which do sue and make execution of such provisions, shall be
out of the Kings Protection, Protection.
and that a man may do with them, as with enemies of our Sovereign Lord the
King and the realm, and he that shall commit any thing against such provisors
in body or in goods, or in other possessions, shall be excused Excused.
against all people, and shall never be impeached or grieved for the same at
any man's suit.

4. Afterward in anno 27. E. 3. ca. 1. another statute was made to this
effect, that is to say, because that it is showed to the King by the grievous
and clamorous complaints of great men and commons, how that diverse of the
people be and have been drawn out of the realm, to answer of things, whereof
the cognizance pertains to the Kings Court, and also that the Judgments
given in the same Courts be impeached in another Court, in prejudice and
disherison of the King and of his Crown, and of all the people of his said
realm, and in the undoing and destruction of the common Law of the same Realm
at all times heretofore used, whereupon good deliberation being had with the
great men, and other of his said council, it is assented and accorded by our
sovereign Lord the Kings, and the great men and commons aforesaid, that all
the people of the Kings liegeance, of what condition that they be, which draw
any out of the Realm in plea, whereof the cognizance pertains to the Kings
Court, Court.
or of things whereof Judgments be given in the Kings Court, or which do sue

Court, shall have day containing the space of two months by warning made to
them in the place where the possessions be which be in debate, or where they
have lands or other possessions, by the Sheriffs, or other the Kings
ministers, to be before the King and his council, or in his Chancerie, or
before the Kings Justices in his places of the one bench or other, or before
other the Kings Justices, which to the same shall be deputed to answer Answer.
in their proper persons to the King of the contempt done in this behalf, and
if they come not at the said day in their proper persons to stand to the Law,
then they, their procurators, atturnies, Atturnies.
executors, Executors.
notaries, and maintainers shall from that day forth be put out of the Kings
protection, Protection.
and their lands, goods, and cattels forfeit Forfeite.
to the King, and their bodies wheresoever they may be found shall be taken
and imprisoned, Impris.
and ransomed at the Kings will, and upon the same a writ shall be made to take
them by their bodies, and to seize their lands, goods and possessions into the
Kings hands, and if it be returned that they be not found, they shall be put in
exigent Exigent.
and outlawed, provided always, that at what time they come before that they
be outlawed, and will yield them to the Kings prison to be justified by the
Law, and to receive that the Court shall award in this behalf, that they shall
be thereto received the forfeiture of the lands, goods, and cattels abiding in
their force, if they do not yield them within the said two months, as before is
said.

5. After this in Anno 38. E. 3. ca. 1. another statute was made to this effect
following, videli^et: It is provided and ordained, that all they which have
obtained, purchased and pursued personal citations, Citations.
or other process in times past, or hereafter shall obtain, purchase or pursue

which have obtained in the same Court Dignities, Offices, Hospitals or any
benefices of Churches which be occupied at this present season by reasonable
title, by any persons of the said realm, if such impetrations be not fully
executed, or shall obtain hereafter like benefice, whereby prejudice, damage,
or let has been or may be done hereafter to him, or to his said Subjects or
persons, heritages, possessions, rights, or any goods, or to the laws, usages,
customs, franchises, and liberties of this realm, and of his Crown, and also
all their maintainers, Mainteiners.

suite of the King as of the party or other whatsoever he be of the realm,

Council, shall seem to be done, without any grace, pardon Pardon.
or remission, to be made by the King, without the will and assent of the
party that shall prove him to be grieved, and without making to him due
satisfaction in this case.

31. E. 3. ca. 4.
6. And after in the same year ca. 4. It is ordained that if any person of what
estate or condition that he be, by any manner attempt, or do any thing against
the said ordinances, or any thing comprised in them, the same person shall be
brought to answer in the manner as before is said, and if he be thereof
attainted or convict, he shall be put out of the Kings protection, and punished
after the form of the said statute made the said 27. year of Ed. 3.

7. Afterward in anno 2. R. 2. ca. 3. another statute was made to this effect,
videlicet: that none of the Kings liege people, nor other person, of what
estate or condition soever he be, shall take nor receive within this Realm
procuracy letter of attorney nor farm, Farmer.

in any point contained in this ordinance, he shall incur the pain and
punishment contained in the statute of provisors made in 27. Ed. 3. by the same

their benefices or other their possessions within the Realm.

8. After this in anno 12. R. 2. ca. 15. another statute was made to this
^ff^^^, that is to say that no liege man of the King of what estate or
conditi^n that he be, (...) over sea.
great or little, shall pass over the sea, nor send out of the Realm of

It is amongst other things ordained and enacted that if any person or persons

case of praemunire, or does make or ordeine any matter or cause to be within
the case of praemunire, but that the same for so much only as touches and
concerns any case or matter of praemunire, shall stand and remain in full
force and effect as the fame was before the making of this Act contained to the
contrary in any wise notwithstanding. And if it shall happen that any peer of
this Realm shall fortune to be indicted of and for any offense that is revived
or made praemunire or Treason by this Act, that then the same peer or pears

that so gave such relief, aid, or comfort, had notice and knowledge of such
offense committed and done by the said offender at the time of such relief,
aid, or comfort, so to be given or ministered.

17. And now I have set forth the statutes of praemunire: I will here also set
forth some few book cases and resolutions, for the better explanation of those
concurrent statutes.

18. In 44. E. 3. a praemunire was brought against diverse, 44. E. 3. fo. 7.
Br. praemunire 4. 8. H. 4. fo. 6. Br. praemunire 6.
some as principals, and some as accessaries, the principals made default and
the accessaries appeared and demanded judgment, if they should be put to
answer before the principals were attainted, and it was adjudged that they
should answer, for in a Praemunire all are principals, and there be no
Accessaries.

19. If a man lease his vicarige for years or life paying rent, 44. E. 3. fo.
36. Br. praemunirc 5.
and sue in the Ecclesiastical Court for the recovery of this rent, he is in
case of a Praemunire: for the rent reserved is a lay thing, and not
Ecclesiastical.

20. 9. E. 4. fo. 3. Br. praemunire 9.
In a Praemunire in the Kings Bench the opinion was that if a Clarke sue
another man in curia Romana, for a thing spiritual, where he may have remedy
within this Realm in the Court of the Ordinary, that he is in case of a
Praemunire, quia trahit in placitum extra regnum.

21. 5. E. 4. fo. f.
Note that the words of the statute are in curia Romana vel alibi, which is
intended in Curia Episcopi, and therefore if a man be excommunicate or
prosecuted in the spiritual Court for a thing which appertains to the common
Law, he that prosecuteth such sui^ is in case of a Praemunire.

22. A prohibition lies often where a Praemunire lies not, Br. praemunire 16.
as of T^th^s of great Trees, or for Tithes of the seventh part a prohi^^^ion
lies, and not a Praemunire, for the nature of the action belongs to the
spiritual Court, but not the cause in this form, but where it is of a lay
thing or of a thing which never appertained to the spiritual Court, of that a
Praemunire lies as of debt, against Executors upon a simple contract, or pro
lesione fidei, upon a promise to pay Ten pounds by such a day, Doct. and
Student. lib. 2. ca. 24.

2. R. 3. fo. 17. Br. praemunire 19.
23. If Executors sue for the goods of their Testator in the spiritual Court,
they are in case of a Praemunire, for in 34. H. 8. Richard Farmer was attainted
in a Praemunire, and forfeited his Fee simple land for ever, for suing for the
goods of his Testator in the spiritual Court.

24. There be some opinions in 8. ass, that a benefice donative by the patron
only is a lay thing, 8. Ass pl 29.
and the Bishop shall not visit nor deprive, and therefore if he meddle with it
in that kind, he is in the case of a Praemunire, and in that case was Barloe
Bishop of Bath in the time of King Edward the sixth, and was constrained to
obtain a pardon, because he had deprived the Deane of Wels which was a
Donative by the Kings letters pattents.

25. I have been more large in this Title, because many men of great quality
and good understanding in Ireland are very confident that the papal
Jurisdiction never received any check or opposition in England or Ireland
before the time of King Henry the Eight, and therefore to make it to appear to
all men that will but open their Eyes to see the truth, I have set down the
said ancient statutes, and book cases, whereby it plainly appears that in
the very height of popery, when prince and people, Laity and Clergy were of
the popes religion, yet in all ages of those very times the papal Jurisdiction
was mainely opposed and utterly rejected, and great and grievous penalties,
videlicet: loss of lands and goods and perpetual imprisonment was inflicted
upon all such as should uphold or any wise maintain that papal Jurisdiction
within these Kingdoms of England and Ireland.

Purveyors. CHAP. 49.
1. FOr the reformation of abuses and oppressions committed by Purveyors,
diverse good Laws and statutes have been made in England, which are of force
in Ireland, and because that the Justices of peace are enabled to put many of
those statutes in execution in part or in the whole, I shall here express the
effect of so many of them as I conceive the Iu. of P. have to do withal,
which are these following, 28. E. 1. articuli super cart c. 2. Without warrant.
vide the statute of 28. Ed. 1. articul. super cart. cap. 2. It is enacted

grieved against this ordinance, he shall have his recovery against the Sheriff

4. Also by another statute made in anno 25. E. 3. ca. 1. it is ordained that

15. And lastly by a statute made in Ireland in anno 18. H. 6. It is enacted
that from thenceforth no Purveyor, Harbinger, nor Aveyner, be within the said
land, but that the Just. of the said land of Ireland that then was, and the
Leivetenants, Justices, or Governors that for the time should be, should pay
or agree with them from whom any goods should be taken by their Achators, and
if the said Lievetenants, Justices, or Governors by their Achators do not in
the order aforesaid, it should be lawful to him whose the goods are to make
resistance to such Achators or officers without offense or impeachment of the
King. And it was also agreed and established that all the statutes in this
behalf made within the Realm of England be holden and kept in all points and
put in execution in this land.

16. These statutes I have rehearsed the more at large to the end that it may
thereby appear what grieveous oppressions have been committed in times past
by Purveyors, and that every man may understand the ease and benefit which the
subjects of Ireland enjoy by the royal composition heretofore made and
established and now continued in this kingdom.

Riots, Routs and unlawful assemblies. CHAP. 50.
1. ANy one Justice of peace alone may use all good means to prevent a Riot or
Rout before it be done, Lamb. 184. 34. Ed. 3. 1. P. Just. 18. Dalton pa. 97.
and for to stay it whilst it is in doing, and in the doing may take and
imprison the Riotters, and bind them to their good behavior, but being once
done and committed, one Justice of peace can neither record the Riot, nor make
enquiry thereof, 14. H. 7. 8. 9.
nor assesse any fine, nor award any process, nor otherwise meddle to punish it,
Dalton pa. 97.
(in the nature of a Riot, or Rout) but only as a Trespass against the peace,
or upon the statutes of Northhampton, or of forceible entries.

2. And yet if one Justice of peace sitting in a judicial place (as in the
Sessions) shall see a Riot, Cromp. 65.
he may command them to be arrested, and may make a record thereof, and the
offenders shall be concluded thereby, but if one Justice of peace shall see a
Riot in another place and shall command them to be arrested, and shall make a
record thereof, the offenders shall not be concluded thereby, but may traverse
it.

3. If a Justice of peace will commit a man to ward, pretending untruely that
he did a Riot, Br. Judges 2. and 10. 9. H 6. ^0. 9. Ed. 4. 3.
where he did none, the party may not have an action of trespass upon the case
against him, for an action will not lie against a Justice or Judge of Record in
a thing that he does as Judge by the opinions in 9. H. 6. 60. and 9. E. 4. 3.
but if this be done of malice or corruption he shall be punished for it in the
Starchamber.

4. Every Justice of peace (being of, and in the County, and having notice of
any Riot, Dyer. 210.
Rout, or unlawful assembly) ought to have a care of the execution of the
statute made 13. H. 4. cap. 7. 13. H. 4. 7.
viz. that the Riotters, etc. be arrested and removed, for if the statute be
not executed by some of the Justices, the two next Justices of peace shall
forfeit each of them 100. l. and every other Justice of peace within that
County in whom there shall be any default, shall be fined in the Starchamber.

5. And therefore every Iu. of P. of the County, 14. H. 7. 9.
hearing of any Riot, or of any Intention of a Riot, (without making any
precept or tarrying for his fellow Justice) shall do well to go himself, (if
he be able) with his servants or other power of the County, if need be, to the
place where such persons be so assembled, and to suppress them, and all such
as he shall find riotously assembled (and armed) to arrest them, and to force
them to put in surety for the peace, or for their good behavior, and for
refusing to give such surety, or in default of surety to imprison them; Also
he may take away their weapons and armor, and seize and prise them for the
King.

6. 14. H. 7. 10. Br. peace 7.
And if the Iu. of P. (being come to the place) shall not find the Riotters,
yet come thither, he may leave his servants there, to restrain them in their
said enterprise, or else to arrest such offenders when they shall come, if they
shall offer to commit any Riot, or to break the peace.

7. So if the Iu. be sick, and shall hear of a Riot, he may send his servants
(or other power of the County, if need be, as it seems) to the place to
repress it, or to arrest such offenders, and to bring them before him, to
find sureties for the peace, and all this he may do, 14. H. 7. 10. Br. peace
17.
and command by word of mouth, without any warrant in writing, and without
expecting the coming of any his fellow Justices, or of the Sheriff or
undersheriffe.

8. Also any one Justice of peace (by the first Assignavimus in the Commission)
may cause to be kept and put in execution all other statutes made for the
repressing of Riots, force and violence, Dalton pa. 9^.
but therein he must deal only according to the form and order in such
statutes prescribed.

9. 13. H. 4. ca. 7. P. 1. 5. Two Justices.
But the ordinary power of punishing of Riots belongs unto two Iu. of P. at
the least, and therefore the two next Justices of peace which dwell nearest in
the County where any Riot, assembly or Rout of people shall be against the law
(together with the Sheriff or undersheriffe of the County upon complaint or
other notice of the Riot,) shall do execution of the statute 13. H. 4. 7.
videlicet, Dyer. 210.
of all and every part thereof respectively, as to them is appointed; Every one
of them upon pain of 100.l. and in default of the two next Justices, the other
Justices of peace of and within the County (upon notice of such riot) ought to
do execution thereof, Cromp. 63.
every one upon danger to be fined in the Starchamber, but the penalty of 100.
l. is only to be levied upon the two next Justices.

10. And if the Riot, Dalton 9^.
etc. be great and notorious whereof by common Intendment every person may
take knowledge, it is not safe for the Justice or Sheriff, etc. to expect and
stay till complaint thereof shall be made to them, or that they shall have
information or notice given them thereof, least they incur thereby the said
penalty of 100.l. a piece.

11. If any other of the Justices of peace of the County, P. R. ^0.
besides those two which are next shall execute this statute, Dalton 98.
that shall excuse the two next Justices, for that the statute gives power
herein to all Justices.

Dalton 98.
12. If one, or the two next Justices shall come, and not the Sheriff or
undersheriffe, such Justices as do come shall be excused of the forfeiture of
100.l. but though the said Justices shall be excused of the said forfeiture,
yet if there comes but one Justice of peace, he ought to arrest the Riotters,
and to remove the force, and commit the riotters, otherwise he is fineable, etc.

13. And if there shall be two Justices present, and neither the Sheriff nor
undersheriffe, Dalton page 98. and 99.
yet those two Justices are fineable, if they shall not do all that, which
(without the Sheriff or undersheriffe) they are authorized to do by the said
statute.

Dalton pa. 99.
14. But no Justice of peace that dwells in another County is bound (upon the
said penalty of 100.l.) to execute the said statute of 13. H. 4. although he
dwells next to the place where the Riot is, and although he be in the
Commission of the peace for the County where the riot is, as it seems, for
the words of the statute are, the Justices which dwell nearest in every County
where such Riot shall be, and not which dwell near to the place where the riot
shall be, and yet it seems safe that such Justice dwelling out of the County
upon notice of such riot, do come into the County, and do his endeavor to
suppress the same riot, and to execute the statute, for that he is one of the
Justices of the County.

15. If the Sheriff or undersheriffe do not come, the Justices ought to send
for them, as Master Marrow thinks.

16. And some seem to be of opinion, that if the Sheriff or undersheriffe
shall not come to the Justices, P. R. 30.
being sent for to assist them, that then all the Justices of peace dwelling
near or remote shall be excused of the same penalty of 100.l. or of any other
penalty or fine, for that the said statute does give the Sheriff or
undersheriffe equal authority, and as it were join him in Commission in the
copulative with the Justices of peace, Cromp. 63. Dalton pa. 99.
but others seem to be of another opinion, videlicet. that if the Sheriff or
undersheriffe shall not come, yet the Justices of peace shall be fined if they
come not and arrest the riotters, and do not moreover proceed to do therein
all that which (without the Sheriff or undersheriffe) they are any ways
authorized to perform.

17. Now what the Justices of peace may or ought to do therein, by force of
this statute 13. H. 4. 7. without, or in the absence of the Sheriff and
undersheriffe is worthy consideration, as being needful for the Justices of
peace to know, and safe for them to perform, as well for the speedy preventing
of such present mischiefs as may happen to the common wealth by such dangerous
assemblies, as also for their saving of the penalty of the Law, otherwise like
to lie upon them.

18. Dalton pa. 99.
But herein others (of good judgment and experience) that have written
thereof, have both seemed to doubt, and written sparingly thereof,
notwithstanding I shall not spare to deliver mine opinion and leave it to the
further consideration of others of better Judgment.

19. As I conceive there is no doubt, but that the Justices of peace (without
the Sheriff or undersheriffe) upon all riots, may and ought first to go to
the place, and such riotters as they shall see or find riotously assembled,
they may and ought to arrest and to take away their armor and weapons, and to
remove the riotters, and may cause them to find sureties for the peace, or
good behavior, and for want of such sureties may commit them to the jail, all
which any one Justice of peace may do.

20. Also two Justices of peace, after the riot committed, P. Riots 4. Cromp.
6. 7. b.
without the Sheriff or undersheriffe, as I conceive, may and ought to inquire
of the riot, and if upon such inquiry the riot be found, the Justices may fine
and imprison the offenders.

21. But two Justices of peace, as I conceive, seeing a riot, may not record
the same upon their own view, without the Sheriff or undersheriffe, and
thereupon, without any inquiry, fine them for the same, and commit them to
prison till they have paid their said fine, for by the statute the Sheriff or
undersheriffe are associated to the Justices of peace, and have equal and
joint authority with them therein, and then consequently the Justices of peace
alone upon their own view, without inquiry, can neither fine them, nor
imprison them for their fine. 14. H. 7. 9. b. See Co. 10. 103. b. such a
matter. M. Lamb. thinks it to be the stat. 34. Ed. 3. 1. that Fineux meant,
rather then the statute of 13. H. 4. 21. H. 6. fo. 5^


22. Yet Fineux chief Justice, says that this statute of 13. H. 4. was made
for the common profit of the Realm, and for a hasty remedy, and to avoid a
present mischief like to happen, and therefore shall be construed largely for
the common good, and in furtherance and advancement of expedition of Justice.

23. Also we see that any one Justice of peace may do all these things in case
of a forceible Entry, for any one Iu. of peace may come with the power of the
County, if need be, and may arrest the offenders, and may record the force by
him viewed, and this record shall be a sufficient conviction, so that he may
commit the offenders to the jail, and may fine them.

24. Also by some good authorities, Fitz. Just. 9. 14. H. 7. 8. Cromp. 65. 196.
if two Justices of peace (without the Sheriff) shall fee a Riot they may
arrest them, and make a record thereof, and the offenders shall be concluded by
such record, for that the view of the riot is not to be traversed.

25. Also the statute 34. E. 3. ca. 1. Rast. Just. 3.
seems to enable two Justices of P. to imprison Riotters, and that without
inquiry, and then consequently, it seems they are to make a record of the
Riot.

26. But as I conceive none of those authorities will warrant two Iu. of P.
upon the statute of 13. H. 4. ca. 7. 13. H. 4. ca. 7^
upon their view alone without the Sheriff to impose a fine upon the Riotters,
and to record the same.

27. And now to the particulars of that which the two next Justices of peace
with the Sheriff or undersheriffe must do in execution of this statute of 13.
H. 4. 7. Every one upon pain of 100.l.

13. H. 4. 7. P. 1. 2.
28. First, they shall go to the place in person, if they be able, where the
Riot, etc. shall be.

29. And they shall take the power of the County (if need be) sc. they shall
have the aid of the Knights and other temporal persons under that degree,
that be above the age of fifteen years, and be able to travel, 2. H. 5. 8.
P. 12.
for all the Kings subjects that are in the County where a Riot, etc. shall be,
being able to travel must be aiding and assistant to the Just. of peace,
Sheriff, or undersheriffe (or other Commissioners when they shall be
reasonably warned,) to ride or go, with the said Justices, etc. Sheriff, etc.
in aid to resist such Riots, etc. upon pain of Imprisonment, and to make fine
and ransom to the King, which ransom shall be treble so much at the least as
the fine, Dyer 232.

30. But it is referred to the discretion of these two Justices, how many or
few they will have to attend them in this business, Cromp. 64.
and in what sort they shall be armed, weaponed or otherwise furnished for it.

31. Nevertheless, it is not good for the Justices to assemble the power of
the County, Cromp. 64. Posse Comitatus.
without certain Information or knowledge of such riotous assembly, yet if
upon false information of a Riot, to be at such a place, the Justices shall
cause the power of the County to be assembled, the Justices shall be excused by
reason of the information; and if without information, the Justices shall
think that such a riotous assembly is made in such a place, and shall assemble
the power of the County to go thither to arrest the Rioters, and when they
come to the place they find a Riot there indeed, they must arrest and imprison
the offenders, and shall be excused of the assembly made by them, but if they
shall find no Riot there, then shall they be punished for making such an
assembly of their own heads without an information and without any cause.

Arrest. Dalton 101.
32. All such offenders as they shall find there present, they shall arrest or
cause to be arrested, and shall remove the force, sc. shall commit to prison
all the Rioters, and take away their weapons.

33. Also it seems, that all such as came in the company with such rioters,
or in the company of any of them, if that the Justices shall find them there
present (though they do nothing, Dalton 101.
and though they came without any intent of their parts to commit any Riot, yet
they shall be arrested, imprisoned, and fined, fee to this purpose in the title
forceible entry.

Mar. Lect. 8. Cromp. ^3.
34. Also all such rioters, as the Justices shall meet in their way (riotously
arrayed, and coming from the place) they may arrest and imprison them, for
that they found them unlawfully assembled, Dalton 102.
but they cannot record any riot by them done, for that they saw it not, yet
they must afterward (as it seems) inquire thereof by a Jury, that so the
offenders may be fined, etc.

35. But if the Justices do come and see the riot committed and after the said
riotters shall escape from the Justices at that time, yet the said Justices
shall record it, but they cannot arrest them, at any other time, except it be
presenly after and in fresh suite, neither can they fine the offenders nor
award any process against them upon the record which they shall make, and yet
for that they saw the riot (and those riotters that be escaped, committing the
riot) they shall record it, but that record shall not be kept amongst the rest
of the records of the peace, but the said Justices shall send the said record
into the Kings Bench, that process may from thence be made upon it against
those riotters that be escaped, where also the said offenders shall not be
admitted to any traverse, but must of necessity make fine for their said
offense.

36. If after the Justices and Sheriff shall see the riot, Dalton 102.
the said riotters shall escape, and the Justices and the Sheriff shall record
the same riot, and then one of the Justices be put out of the Commission, or
the Sheriff or one of the Justices shall happen to dye, yet shall that record
be sent or certified into the Kings Bench by the other Justice.

37. Also such offenders as the Justices saw committing the riot, though they
shall escape from the Justices, 13. H. 7. Cromp. 196. Dalton 102.
yet the said Justices may after grant out their warrants for them, and send
them to the jail, till they shall find surety for the good behavior.

38. If such offenders shall depart before the coming of the Justices, yet
upon certain information of their being there, Dalton ibid.
the said Justices may also grant out their warrants for them, 34. Ed. 3. ca.
1. P. Just. 18.
and may commit them till they have found sureties for their good behavior,
and yet rather the Justices shall do well to proceed against them, by inquiry,
and so to fine the offenders for the King, etc.

39. Also in the execution of this arrest of the riotters, Cromp. 62. 158.
Dalton 102.
the said Justices, etc. may justify the beating, wounding, or killing of any
the riotters that shall resist them, or that will not yield themselves to them.

40. Dalton ibid.
Also the said Justices may take from such riotters their Armor, harness, and
weapons, and shall cause the same to be prised, and to be answered to the King
as forfeited.

41. After the arrest made, Record. 13. H. 4. ca. 7. P. 1.
the said Justices (and Sheriff or undersheriffe) shall make a record in
writing of the said riot, scil. of all that which they shall see and find done
in their presence against the Law without any other inquiry.

42. But if the Justices of peace do not themselves see the Riot, Dalton 103.
then they cannot make a record thereof, but then they must inquire thereof.

Ibid.
43. If the Justices of peace, etc. going to see a Riot, another riot shall
happen in their presence, they may record this, and arrest and imprison the
offenders.

Ibid.
44. So if the Riotters shall make a Riot upon the Justices and Sheriff that
do come to arrest them for their former riot, they may record that also.

Ibid.
45. So if two Justices of peace and the Sheriff or undersheriffe shall meet
for any other occasion of service, or for any private business (as upon an
arbitrament or other like matter) and a riot shall happen to be done upon
themselves, or in their sight, they may record it, and may arrest and imprison
the offenders.

9. H. 6. fo. 60. Cromp. 63. 65.
46. And if the Justices of peace shall record a riot, and upon examination of
the matter after, it shall appear to be no riot, or that they saw it not, or
that there was no riot at all, yet the parties shall be concluded thereby, and
have no remedy by course of common Law; but if it be done of malice or
partiality, they shall be punished for it in the Starchamber, and therefore the
Justices shall do well to be advised what they record. See 9. H. 6. fo. 60.
Br. Judges 2.

Dalton pa. 103.
47. And again, for that this record of the Justices and Sheriff is a
sufficient conviction in it self against the offenders, therefore it ought to
be formal and certain, as well for the time and place as also for the number
of weapons, manner, and other circumstances, because the parties be concluded
thereby, and shall not be received to traverse, or deny it in any point.

48. For the form of the record, vide tit. Warrants and presidents.

49. The record ought to remain with one of the said Justices of peace, Dalton
pa. 103.
and shall not be left amongst the records of the Sessions of the peace, it
being made out of the Sessions and not appointed to be certified thither.

50. Also the said Justices of peace (and none other Justices of peace) shall
commit such offenders to the jail, Dalton pa. 103.
there to remain convict by their view, testimony and record (as in case of
forceible Entry) until they have paid a fine to the King.

51. Also such commitment of the offenders to the jail ought to be done
presently. Co. ^. 120.


52. And the power of the County ought to be ayding to the Sheriff and
undersheriffe for the convaying of them to the jail, Dalton pa. 103.
if there be occasion.

53. If the Justices of peace, and Sheriff or undersheriffe shall record the
riot, Cromp. 61.
and shall not presently commit the riotters to prison, or if they shall commit
them to prison, and shall not record the riot, they shall forfeite every of
them 100.l. by the statute 13. H. 4. F^o^^ ^. P^^^t^. 1^ H. 4. ^a. 7.
for that (...) ^ha^e no^ done execution of the same stat. for by the statute
they shall record fine and commit the offenders, or else the statute is not
fully executed.

54. Also the said Justices of peace, and none other, shall assesse the fines
upon the offenders, Cromp. 161. 2. H. 5. ca. 8.
for they have best knowledge of the matter, etc. Co. 8. 4. 1. a. which fines
by the statute 2. H. 5. 8. ought to be of good value that out thereof the
charges of the said Justices and other officers may be borne, sc. their charges
in going, tarrying, Dalton pa. 104.
and returning, etc. about the suppressing and inquiry of such riots, of which
charges payment shall be made by the Sheriff, by Indenture thereof made
between him and the said Justices.

55. And yet such fines must be reasonable and just and secundum quantitatem
and qualitatem delicti, and not unreasonable or excessive, (for excessus in re
qualibet jure reprobatur communi, Co. 11. 44. and so it is commanded by the
statutes 18. E. 3. 2. and 34. Edw. 3. 1. P. Just. 1. and 18.

56. Note also that the fine assessed in this and such like cases must not be
imposed upon all the offenders jointly, but must be assessed upon every
offender severally. Co. 11. 43. 44.

57. And the said Justices shall cause the said fines to be estreated into the
Exchequer, Dalton 104.
that so the said fines may be levied to the Kings use, and then they are to
deliver the offenders again, as it seems, or else the said Justices may
record such riot by them viewed, and commit the offenders, and after certify
the record to the Assizes or Sessions, or into the Kings Bench, as in case of a
forceible Entry.

58. 13. H. 4. 7.
But it the riot was not committed in the presence of the Justices of peace, or
that the offenders be departed before the coming of the said Justices and
Sheriff or undersheriffe, then the said Justices, or two of them at the least,
within one month after such riot, assembly, or rout, shall inquire thereof,
Enquiry.
by the oaths of a sufficient Jury (to be returned by the Sheriff, and the
same riot, etc. being found by such Inquisition, the said Justices must make a
record in writing of such their inquiry, and presentment found before them,
which record also is to remain with one of the said Justices. P. R. 29.

59. The form of such enquiry or presentment you may fee in the title of
warrants and presidents.

60. This enquiry shall not be, Cromp. 62.
but where the rioters are gone before the coming of the Justices.

61. Dalton pa. 104.
It is not necessary that one of the Justices of peace which shall make enquiry
of a riot, be of the Quorum.

62. Although the words of the statute are, the same Justices, Dalton pa. 104.
scil. which came to see the riot, shall enquire, yet if any other two Justices
of peace of that County shall do it, that will suffice.

63. Ibid.
Also the Justices of peace although they go not to see the riot, yet they may
enquire thereof within the month after.

64. Dalton pa. 10^.
Neither is it of such necessity to have the enquiry within the month, that
for default thereof the presentment shall be void, for the Justice of peace
may enquire thereof at any time by force of their Commission, but if it be not
within the month then the two next Justices are in danger to loose each of
them 100. l. for their neglect, and yet if these Justices do charge the Jury
within the month, and do give day unto them for to yield their verdict and
presentment after the month, the statute is not offended.

65. At this enquiry the Sheriff or undersheriffe ought to be present with the
Justices of peace, Ibid.
but the Sheriff or undersheriffe be now as ministers (only for the returning
of the Jury) for the enquiry, and be not herein associated with the Justices as
they were before in arresting the rioters, and recording their disorder, and
therefore they are now to be spared from being Judges therein, howbeit by this
their presence they may help to espy the evil, and besides, it adds force
and credit to the certificate.

66. If the Justices do assemble themselves, the Sheriff and the Jury, Cromp.
62. P. R. 29.
to make enquiry of a riot within the month and the parties been agreed
amongst themselves, so as none will solicit the inquiry, nor give in Evidence
for the King upon the riot, yet ought the Justices to proceed (ex officio) to
make inquiry of that riot, seeing it may be that some of the Jury may have
knowledge of the riot.

67. And also the Justices ought to make Proclamation, that if any man will
give Evidence for the King concerning that riot, or (generally) will inform
the Kings Justices of any Riots, Routs, etc. and thereupon some other persons
may perhaps come forth to inform them therein.

P. R. 29. Cromp. 62.
68. But if at the parties request, the Justices shall dismiss the Jury without
inquiry, they are fineable in the Starchamber to the King for the same.

Dalton 105.
69. And if the Justices shall not proceed herein (ex officio) without some
will give in Evidence for the King, they shall be in danger to lose 100. l. a
piece upon this statute, for the reasons abovesaid.

Ibid.
70. And it seems that the Justices may justly bind to their good behavior
the parties that first complained to them of this riot, and have caused them to
meet, and now will not prosecute the same for the King, but have agreed it.

13. H. 4. 7. P 2. Hear and determine.
71. After such inquiry made, and riot found, the said Justices have
authority, by the said statute to hear and determine the same according to
the law, viz. they may make out process against the offenders under their own
test. (thereby to cause the offenders to come in and answer) and may assesse
their fynes, Dalton 105.
and may commit them to prison till they have paid the same, and may deliver
them after payment of the said fine, Br. Impris. 100.
or upon sureties taken for it (which sureties ought to be bound by
recognisance) or otherwise they may receive their traverse, and thereupon (if
the matter will so serve) to discharge and dismiss them, but then the said
Justices shall do well to send such indictment or inquisition found (and such
traverse) to the next Quarter Sessions, or into the Kings Bench, and there the
traverse shall be tried and determined according to Law. P. R. 30.

72. But when men are indicted of Riots, or the like they will usually yield
themselves, and pray to be admitted to their fine, in which case the Justices
of peace, commonly do assesse but some small fine, and upon the payment
thereof do discharge the offender, and hereby the offenders are not
imprisoned, which would work more fear in such offenders then such fine, and
therefore it is behoovefull for the Justices of peace to use good care and
discretion herein, for by the statute the offenders are as well to be imprisoned
as fined, and it seems much more serviceable and more agreeing with the
intent of the Law, besides this fine called by diverse old statutes ransom,
Mar. ca. 1. 2. 3. 4.
(or redemptio) in Latin seems by the propriety of the word to imply that
the offender ought first to be imprisoned and then to be ransomed and delivered
in consideration of this fine, Dalton p. 105.
or otherwise the statute is not fully executed in all points as it ought to be.

73. Ibid.
And these fynes the Justices of peace are now willed by the statute 2. H. 5.
ca. 8. to put in greater sums then they were wont to be put in such cases,
for the bearing of the charges of the Justices and other officers, etc.

74. At the common Law a Riot was punishable as a Trespass, and as well the
fine as the imprisonment were at the discretion of the Judges, and in the same
manner the statute of 13. H. 4. enableth the Justices of peace to punish such
offenders, but now as well the imprisonment as the fine of such offenders are to
be increased by the said statute 2. H. 5.

75. And therefore where the Justices of peace are remiss herein, Cromp. 63.
P. R. 24.
scil. in not sufficiently punishing such offenders by due fine and
imprisonment, the Lords in the Starchamber, may, and do often assesse upon
Riotters, for the same Riot, (for which the Justices of peace have formerly
assessed a fine in the Country) a greater penalty, if they see cause, and yet
in this case the offenders be not twice punished for one offense, but part of
the due punishment is inflicted at one time, and part at another.

76. Lastly, if the truth, Certificate. 13. H. 4. 7. 19. H. 7. 13. P. 3. 15.
or Riot cannot be found by the Justice of peace upon such enquiry (being
hindered by the perverseness of the Jurors, or by the unlawful maintenance, or
imbracery of others) then within one month next after the enquiry the same
Justices and Sheriff or undersheriffe shall certify before the King and his
Council, scil. into the Starchamber, Dalton pa. 107.
or to the body and board of the privy Council, or into the Kings Bench the
whole fact and circumstances thereof, with the certainty of the names of the
principal offenders, P. 15.
and also the names of such mainteiners and embracers, with their misdemeanors,
and of the time, place, and other circumstances, and impediments, yet the not
certifying of the maintenance or embracery is but forfeiture of twenty pound a
piece to every of the Justices and Sheriff the not certifying the rest, P. 13.
But such traverse and certificate shall be sent into the Kings Bench and there
be tried. P. 1^.
is a forfeiture of 100. l. Cromp. 63. b. and 199. b.

77. The end of this certificate is but only to put and force the offenders to
answer thereto, before the King and his Council, and though the words of the
statute do make this certificate to be of the force of a presentment of
twelve men against the offenders, yet such certificate is no Conviction, but
that the offenders may traverse it by the words of the same statute: and so
this certificate is only of the nature of a declaration or indictment at the
common law, and therefore it ought to comprehend the certainty of the time,
place, persons and other material circumstances.

Dalton p. 107.
78. If this certificate be not made within one month after the inquiry, then
it is not according to the statute, and so not good to force the offenders to
answer.

Ibid.
79. If two Justices of peace and the Sheriff shall go to see a Riot, yet any
two other Justices of the County, may make the enquiry, and then they
altogether, or the first two, or the last two with the Sheriff or
undersh^riffe may make certificate thereof within the month after that
inquisition taken.

Cromp. 63.
80. Where there be several certificates made, or that the certificate and
enquiry do disagree, then that shall be proferred which is best for the King.

81. If there shall be twenty parties to a Riot, and the Jury shall find but
ten of them guilty, Dalton 107.
yet the Justices may certify that twenty committed the Riot, and this
certificate of the Justices shall stand good.

Dalton 107.
82. Also it seems, if any thing material happen to be omitted or left out in
the inquisition, yet it may be supplied by this certificate, and it shall stand
good.

83. If after the inquiry and before the certificate, the Sheriff shall dye,
Ibid.
or one of the Justices be put out of the Commission, no certificate can be
made by the opinion of Master Marrow.

84. For the form of such certificate see the Title of warrants and presidents.

2. H 5. 8. P. 6.
85. Upon the default of the two next Justices, and Sheriff or undersheriffe,
for not excuting the said statute of 13. H. 4. ca. 7. the party grieved may
have a Commission Commission.
to inquire, as well of the Riot, as of the defaults of the said Justices and
Sheriff.

2. H 5. ^. P. 6.
86. Also the Lord Chancellor of Ireland (if he shall have notice of such a
Riot) shall send the Kings writ to the Justices and Sheriff, commanding them
to execute the said statute of 13. H. 4.

87. And although that such writ come not to the said Justices, Sheriff, or
undersheriffe, yet they shall not be excused of the penalty of 100.l.
aforesaid, if they make not execution of the said statute.

2. H. 5 ca. 9.
88. Also if any assemblies of people in great number in manner of insurrection,
8. H. 6. ca. 14.
or other rebellious Riots, shall be done or committed, Rast. 374.
and that such off^ndors shall withdraw themselves, to the intent to avoid the
execution of the Law, thereupon certificate by two Justices of peace, Dalton p.
108.
and the Sheriff of that County by letters under their seals, to the Lord
Chancellor of England of the same Riot, and that the common voice and fame
thereof runs in the said County, the Lord Chancellor may make a Capias to
the said Sheriff for the apprehending of such offenders, and after, if need
be, a writ of Proclamation that the said offenders yield themselves in the
Kings Bench at a certain day upon pain to be convicted thereof.

89. The statute of 13. H. 4. 13. H. 4. ca. 7.
authorizing and enjoining the Justices of peace (together with the Sheriff)
to arrest, remove, and punish the offenders, as is before declared, gave no
remedy to the party grieved, if the Justices of peace or Sheriff should make
default therein, and therefore the said statute of 2. H. 5. was made
authorizing the Lord Chancellor at the instance of the party grieved to grant
a Commission to inquire of the defaults of the two next Justices of peace and
Sheriff in not executing the aforesaid statute of 13. H. 4. and withal
providing how the charges of the Just. spent about the suppressing and inquiry
of such Riots should be borne, and also limitting what punishment as well the
offenders of such riots, as also all such as should not be ready to assist and
aid the said Justices to repress such Riotters, should suffer.

90. So as now it appears by that which has been said that the Justices of
peace are to be severely punished if they shall be remiss or negligent in the
due execution of the said statute of 13. H. 4. and therefore it will be
requisite in this place to set forth for the instruction of the Justices of
peace these particulars following, videlicet:

1. First, what shall be said to be a Riot, Rout or unlawful assembly and what
not.

2. What persons may commit a Riot, Rout or unlawful assembly.

What shall be said to be a Riot, Rout or unlawful assembly within the meaning
of these statutes. CHAP. 51.
1. When three persons or more shall come or assemble themselves together, Br.
Riot 5. Cromp. 68. P.R. 25.
to the intent to do any unlawful Act with force or violence against the
person of another, his possessions, or goods, as to kill, beat, or otherwise
to hurt or to imprison a man, to pull down a house, wall, pale, hedge or ditch
wrongfully, to enter upon another man's possession, or to cut or take away
Corn, grass, Br. Riots 4. Unlawful Assembly.
wood, or other goods wrongfully, to hunt unlawfully in any park, or warren,
or to do any other unlawful act with force or violence against the peace, or
to the manifest terror of the people, if they only meet to such a purpose or
intent (although they shall after depart of their own accord, Rout.
without doing any thing) yet this is an unlawful assembly.

2. If after their first meeting they shall ride, go, Dalton 20^.
or move forward toward the execution of any such Act (whether they put their
intended purpose in execution or not) this is a Rout.

3. And if they do execute any such thing indeed, then it is a riot; Riot.
and yet by the opinion of some a Rout is only, where such a company (of three
or more) are so assembled for their own common quarrel, Ibid.
as where the Inhabitants of a Town do assemble together to pull down a
house, wall, pale, ditch or other enclosure, pretending to have title of
common, or a way there, or to beat a man that has done them some public
offense, but yet the word Rout, seems to have a more large and ample meaning,
as appears by the statute of 18. Ed. 3. st. 1. speaking of Routs that are
brought in the presence of the Justices, and the statute of 7. R. 2. ca. 6.
treating of riding in great Routs.

4. Now in Riots, Routs or unlawful assemblies, these four circumstances are
to be considered:

1. First, the number of the persons assembled.

2. Secondly, the intent or purpose of their meeting.

3. Thirdly, the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the Act.

4. Fourthly, the manner and circumstances of the Act.

5. For the number, The number.
there must be necessarily three persons at the least so gathered together, or
else it can be no Riot, Rout or unlawful assembly within the meaning of these
statutes.

6. But an assembly of an hundred persons or more (yea though they be in
armor) yet if it be not in terrorem populi, and were assembled without any
intent to break the peace, it is not prohibited by any of these statutes.

Cromp. 6^. P. R. 2^. The intent. Cromp. 61. Dalton 201.
7. For it seems it can be no Riot, etc. except there be an intent precedent
to do some unlawful Act, and with violence or force.

8. And therefore if diverse be assembled, and none of them do know to what
end or purpose they are met, this can make no riot, or Rout, till the intent be
known.

9. If the master (intending to make a Riot) takes with him his ordinary
servants, and makes an affray or other outrage with them, this is no Riot in
the servants, Ibid.
except their master had made them privy to his intent before, but the master
only shall be punished for the riot, and the servants as trespassers.

10. And in this former case, it is not material, though the number of his
servants which go with him be above his degree, so long as they be his
household servants. P. R. 25.

Cromp. ^^
11. If diverse, being lawfully assembled, shall quarrel or fall out upon the
sudden without any such former intent, this is no riot, but a sudden Affray.

Dalton p. ^^^.
12. If diverse be at an Alehouse, and without any intention of an Affray, they
suddenly fall together by the Ears, this is no riot but a sudden affray,
because they had no such intention before.

13. If a Jury being together shall fall out and fight, Ibid.
this is no riot, because they were lawfully assembled, but it is a great
misdemeanor, for which they shall be fined and imprisoned.

14. Also where there be three or more gathered together, (...) 201.
either to execute the Justice of the Law, or for the exercise of valou^ and
trial of activity, 3. H. 7. 1. Br. Riots 2.
or for the increase of amity and neighbourly friendship (and being met
without any intent to break or disturb the peace or to offer violence or hurt
to the person of any) such assemblies be not prohibited by any statute, nor
unlawful, as if the Sheriff, undersheriffe, bailiffe or other officer shall
take power what number he shall think good to execute the Kings process, this
is no unlawful assembly.

15. So it is a lawful assembly which is gathered together to run at Tilt,
etc. by the Kings commandment.

16. So the assembly of people, and their use of harness upon usual days in
Dublin, Dalton 202.
and other Cities and Towns being only for disport or exercise of Arms is
lawful, and though it be with a great assembly of people, and in armor, yet
it being neither in terrorem populi, nor to do any act with force or violence
against the peace, it is lawful.

17. Also, if diverse do assemble and gather together, Ibid.
to drink at an Alehouse, or to play at football, bucklers, bear or
bullbaitings, dancings, Bowls, Cards or Dice, or such like disports, that is
no Riot, nor prohibited, for these meetings usually are not with any intent to
offer or do violence or hurt to the person, possessions, or goods of any
other, neither are they malum in se, but if these be done upon the Sabbath day
they are misdemeanors, and sufficient cause to bind the offenders to the good
behavior, and so it is of keeping faires and markets upon the Sabbath day.

18. Ibid.
But if any of the persons assembled together for any the disports above
mentioned (or for the like) came with an intent or purpose to break or
disturb the peace, or to offer violence or hurt to the person of any, and
shall make an affray, or do any other outrage, this seems to be a riot in so
many as came with any such unlawful intent or purpose.

19. P. R. 25.
And if any of the persons assembled together to drink or play at an Alehouse,
or for any the disports above mentioned, or the like, shall fall out suddenly,
(without any former intention of an affray) and in that their falling out they
shall betake themselves to sundry parts, and shall make an affray, this seems
to be no Riot; Dalton p. ^02^
for that it was without any such intent before their said assembly, and done
only upon the sudden, and upon a sudden occasion happening after their said
meeting; and again their said assembly was at the first lawful, or at least
not prohibited by any of these statutes, nor yet by the common Law.

20. But otherwise, if by agreement they shall meet again and fight
afterward, Ibid.
that makes it a Riot, as being a new assembly upon the former quarrel, and
so their second meeting was upon an intent precedent to do an evil Act.

21. Now concerning the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the Act, Lawfulness of
the Act.
it is to be observed that lawfulness or unlawfulness of the thing done or
intended, does not always excuse or accuse the parties to a Riot, etc. but so
that the manner and circumstances of the fact, must also be considered.

Br. Riots 1.
22. For every man may assemble company to aid him in his house, against injury
or violence, but if a man be threatened, that if he come to such a place, he
shall be beaten, in this case, if he shall assemble any company to go thither
with him (though it be to the safeguard of his person) it seems to be within
the compass of these statutes and unlawful. Br. Riots 1.

Cromp. 66.
23. Every man in peaceable manner, may assemble meet company (and may come) to
do any lawful thing, or to remove or cast down any common nuisance done to
them.

Co. 5. 101. and 9. 55.
24. Every private man, to whose house or land any nusans shall be erected, made
or done, may in peaceable manner assemble a meet company with necessary
tools, and may remove, pull, or cast down, such nusans, (and that before any
prejudice received thereby) and for that purpose if need be, may also enter
into the other man's ground.

36. Eliz. Cromp. 66.
25. A man erects a wear cross a common Ryver (where people have a common
passage with their boats) and diverse did assemble with spades, Crows of Iron,
and other things necessary to remove the said Wear, and made a Trench in his
land that did erect the wear, to turn the water, so as they might the better
take up the said wear, and they did remove the said nusans, this was holden
neither any forceible Entry nor yet any Riot.

Dalton 203.
26. But in the cases aforesaid, if in removing any such nusans, etc. the
persons so assembled shall use any threatening words (as to say, they will do
it in despite of the other, or they will do it though they dye for it, or
such like words) or shall use any other behavior, in apparent disturbance of
the peace, then it seems to be a Riot, and therefore where there is cause to
remove any such nusans (or to do any like Act) it is the safest not to
assemble any multitude of people, but only to send one or two persons, or (if a
greater number) yet no more then are needful, and only with meet tools, to
remove, cast, or pull down the same, and that such persons tend their
business only without disturbance of the peace, for the manner of doing a
lawful thing may make it unlawful.

Ibid.
27. Also the manner of doing an unlawful Act, by an assembly of people may be
such and so handled, as that it shall not be punished as a Riot, as if I should
assemble a meet company to carry away a piece of Timber, or other thing
(whereto I pretend a right) that cannot be carried without a great number, if
the number be not more then are needful for such purpose, although another man
have better right to the thing so carried away, and that this Act be a wrong
and unlawful, yet is it of it self no Riot, except there be withal
threatening words used, or other disturbance of the peace.

28. The manner.
As there must necessarily be three persons at the least assembled together to
make a Riot, Dalton 204.
etc. so they being together and their demeanor must be such, as shall or may
breed some apparent disturbance of the peace, either by threatening speeches,
turbulent gesture, show of armor or actual force or violence, to the terror
of the peaceable sort of people, or to the emboldening and stirring up of such
as are busy headed, and of evil disposition, by such fact, or else it can be
no Riot, etc. for, as I said before, the manner of doing a lawful thing may
make it unlawful. and sic e converso.

29. And therefore if diverse in one company going to the church, Ibid.
fair, or market, shall go armed, or one going to the Sessions, or other like
assembly shall go in harness (to the terror of the people) though he or they
have no intent to fight or to commit any Riot, yet this is a Rout by the manner
of his or their going, being needless, disordered and against the Law, see the
statute. 2. Ed. 3. ca. 3.

30. Cromp. 64.
But in the former cases if they had gone in privy Coats of plate, shirts of
maile or the like, to the intent to defend themselves from some adversary,
this seems not punishable within these statutes, for that there is nothing
openly done, in terrorem populi.

31. One N. W. together with fourscore persons, 31. El.
came with spades, mattocks, pistols, swords, and daggers, in the night to a
piece of ground (where Sir Thomas St. had made a great wear cross over the
river of Trent in the County of Notting. to the great nusans of passengers
there, Cromp. 64.
etc.) and there they made one or two little Trenches to let the water pass,
etc. and though it were lawful to make the Trenches, and to debruse the
nusans, yet for that they came with such number and weapons, they were deeply
fined in the Starchamber.

32. Also a Lord of a Coppihold, did enter with twenty persons, 31 and 32. El.
Cromp. 64. Dalton 204.
and cut his Coppiholders corn with force, for that his Coppiholder would not
compound with him for his fine, and although the entry of the Lord was holden
lawful, yet punishable as a Riot, in regard of his number and force.

33. In all cases where three, or more shall enter into lands, Cromp. 64.
Dalton 205.
etc. with force (upon the possession of another) where their entry is lawful,
yet it is a Riot, by reason of the number and force, for the statute of 5. R.
2. prohibiteth the entry with force, or with multitude of people, although the
entry be (otherwise) lawful.

What persons may commit a Riot. CHAP. 52.
1. IF a number of women, (or children under the age of discretion) do flock
together for their own cause, this is no assembly punishable by these
statutes, unless a man of discretion moved them to assemble for the doing of
some unlawful Act as Master Marrow held, Cromp. 62.
but yet certain women that had apparelled themselves in men's apparel, Dalton
205.
and had pulled down riotously a lawful enclosure, were worthily punished for
the same in the Starchamber contrary to Master Marrowes opinion.

2. Also women covert are holden to be within the statute of Mert. ca. 6. Co.
3. 72. and 11. 161.
for ravishment of wards, and within the statute of Westminster. 1. ca. 20. de
malefactoribus in parcis, and within the statute of 2. Eliz. ca. 2. for
recusancy, although they be not particularly named within any of this statute.

Co ibid f. bre. 670. 4. E 4. 16.
3. Also if a woman covert shall commit any riot, or do any Trespass or other
wrong she is punishable for it, and for a trespass done by the wife, or for a
scandal published by her; the action lies both against the husband and wife,
sc. an action of trespass, or of the case, shall be brought against the
husband and the wife, and there the husband is chargeable to the damages, or
fine, because he is a party to the action and Judgment, but if a woman covert
without her husband be indicted of a Trespass, Co. 21. 61. b.
riot, or other wrong, there the wife shall answer, and be party to the
Judgment only, and in such case the fine set upon the wife shall not be levied
upon the husband, 22. Ass. ^7. 43. E. 3. 18.
yet after the husbands death it seems such damages or fine shall then be
levied upon the wife her self, and as for imprisonment, or other corporal
pain, it shall be inflicted upon the wife only, and not upon the husband for
his wives Act or default.

Dal^^n 205.
4. If a Mayor and Alderman or Bailiffe and Burgesses, or the fellows of any
other society do assemble in their common quarrel, and make a riot or rout,
this shall be punished in their own private natural persons, and not in the
body politic.

Recognisance. CHAP. 53.
1. A Recognisance is a bond of record, testifying the Recognisor to owe a
certain sum of money to some other, and the acknowledging of the same is to
remain of record, and none can take it but only a Judge or Officer of record.

2. And these recog. in some cases the Iu. of peace are enabled to take by the
express words of certain statutes, but in other cases (as for the peace, and
good behavior, or the like,) they may do it of congruity, without any
express authority given them either by their Commission, or by statute.

3. Note wheresoever any statute gives them power to take a bond of any man,
or to bind over any man, Cromp. 197.
or to take sureties for any matter or cause, See Fitz. 82.
it seems they may take a Recog. yea wheresoever they have authority given
them to cause a man to do any thing, there it seems they have of congruity
power given them to bind the party by recog. to perform or do it, Dalton
298.
and if the party shall refuse so to be bound, that then the Judge may send
him to the Jail.

4. I will here set down only some particulars, Ibid.
where the Justices of peace out of their Sessions may take a recognisance.

5. One Justice of peace may take a recognisance for the peace.

6. Ibid.
Also the Justice of peace may take a recognisance for the good behavior (by
the Commission) and these the Justice of peace may take either upon discretion
or upon complaint made to him, or upon a supplicavit delivered to him.

7. Ibid.
One Justice of peace may bind by recognisance such as do declare any thing
against a felon or Traitor to appear at the Assizes or Sessions, there to give
Evidence against the offender, and so in diverse other offenses.

8. Ibid.
One Justice of peace may bind by recognisance the master that shall misuse
his apprentice, etc. to appear at the Sessions, etc.

9. Two Justices, etc. may bail prisoners, which must be done by recognisance,
see here tit. Bailement.

10. Also two Justices of peace may bind by recognisance the defendant in a
suit of Tithes, to obey the sentence of the Judge, see postea tit. Tithes.

11. A Justice of peace can take no Recognisance, but only for such matters as
concern his office, see hereof postea tit. Surety for the Peace.

12. Note also, that a recognisance taken by a Justice is a matter of record
presently, so soon as it is taken and acknowledged, although it be not made
up, but only entered into his book, nay although it be not entered, as it
seems. See Stamf. 77. etc. Br. record. 58.

13. If a Justice of peace shall take a recognisance, where he has no
authority, it is void.

14. And these recognisances taken by the Justices of peace are to be certified
by them at their next quarter Sessions, except recog. taken for such as shall
inform against felons or Traitors, and upon bailement of felons, which by
statute they are appointed to certify at their next general jail deliverie.

15. For the Forms of recognisances, see hereafter tit. Warrants and

2. After a robbery committed, the whole hundred must answer the loss, if the
Robbers be not taken within Forty days, and yet for that the party robbed has
his recovery and execution against some one or few persons of that hundred,
therefore for a contribution to be yielded from the residue of the said hundred
upon complaint made by the parties against whom such recovery and execution is
had, any two Just. of peace, the one being of the Quorum, being of the same
County, and inhabiting in or near the same hundred where such execution shall
be had, may assesse and tax according to their discretions proportionably all
and every the Towns and Parishes, etc. as well of the same hundred where the
robbery was committed, as also of the liberties within the said hundred toward
an equal contribution to be had for the relief of the parties charged, the
which money the Constables of every Town shall levy and deliver over to the
same Justices, or to one of them within Ten days after collection, and which
the said Justices shall deliver over (upon request) to the parties charged, to
whose use the same was collected.

3. The like taxation, assessement, levying and payment shall be had and made

after huy and cry, viz. if upon suit any recoverie and execution of any money
or any damages shall be had against some one or few persons of that hundred
where such default was, toward the ease of the hundred where the Robbery was
done, upon complaint made by the parties so charged, to any two such Justices
of peace, the said Justices may make the like assessement, etc. toward the
relief of the parties so charged.

4. Note that if any man be robbed in his house the hundred shall not be charged
therewith, whether it were done in the night or in the day.

it be in the day time, or by day light, Co. ibid.
though it be before Sun rising or after the Sun setting the hundred shall
answer for it.

6. If upon pursuit any one of the offenders be apprehended, the hundred shall
not be charged, 11. Caroli c. 13. in Ireland.
although the residue of the offenders happen to escape, but pursuit, without
apprehending some of the Robbers, is no excuse.

7. Cromp. 179.
If the party that was robbed shall himself take any of the thieves, after Huy
and Cry made, this shall excuse the hundred.

8. It is said by my Lord Dyer, obitur in anno. 22. El. that the statute is

Dublin. ss. the 20. day of July Anno regni regis Caroli I. S. was delivered
for felony our of the jail of D. in the said County at the Sessions holden
before A.B. and his fellows at Sale, the day and year aforesaid, and is
allowed to beg for his Fees by the space of six weeks, and in case he can
get no master to work with in the said term, then he is assigned to go
directly to D. in the county of Mead, wherein he says he was borne, or last
dwelled by the space of three years, and he is allowed 14. days next after
the six weeks for his passage thither (or such number of days as to him shall
be limited by the discretion of the maker of the said letter) In witness
whereof the seal of the prison from the which he was delivered thereunto is
set, and in such shires where no jail is the sheriff thereof for the time
being shall cause a seal to be engraved with the name of the shire, and shall
order and use the same seal to and for such persons so delivered, as is
aforesaid, after like manner and form as the Jailer and keeper of the jail is
limited and appointed to do by this Act. And it is also enacted that every
Clerk of the peace of the Shire within the which such person shall be
delivered, and every common Clerk of every City, borough, or town corporate
within the which any such person shall be delivered shall make for every such
person as shall be so delivered where they be such officers, the said letter in
form abovesaid, without any Fee taking for the same, and shall deliver every
such letter to the Jailer or keeper of the prison from the which such person
shall be delivered, and if there be no Jail there, then to the Sheriff of the
shire, where such deliverance shall be had within one day next after the end of
the Sessions, where any such deliverance is had, upon pain to loose and
forfeit for the default of every letter 12. d. to the Kings Majesty, and that
the Jailer or Keeper of the prison from the which the person shall be so
delivered, and in case there be no Jail, then the Sheriff of the shire where
any such deliverance shall be had, shall not suffer any such person to go
abroad to beg for his fees, nor depart out of prison, except it be to service
or labor, unless the said Jailer or sheriff first deliver to the said person
the said letter containing his name, sealed with the seal of the prison, from
the which he shall be delivered, or else with the seal engraved with the name
of the shire, if there be no prison, upon pain for every default to loose 12.
d. to the Kings highness. And it is enacted that if any person or persons so
being delivered out of prison, at any time after the said feast do beg, not
having the letter aforesaid sealed in form abovesaid, or beg contrary to the
tennor of the said letter, that then he shall be taken, ordered and whipped in
every behalf, like as is above appointed for strong beggars, and that to be
done and executed by such as be above limited to do the same upon strong
beggars, and in such wife, and upon such pain, as is above limited, for non
execution of the punishment of strong beggars, provided always that it be
lawful to every person and persons, being bounden by reason of any foundation
or ordinance to give or distribute any money in Alms, and also to every person
and persons at common doles, used at burials or obytes, to give and dispose in
Alms any money to every person and persons commi^ng to such Alms or Doles
after like form and manner as they have been accustomed to do in that
behalf, before the making of this Act, without any danger or penalty of this
statute, any thing contained in this present statute to the contrary hereof
notwithstanding, provided also that it be lawful to all masters and Governors
of hospitals, to lodge and harbor any person or persons of charity or Alms,
according to the foundation of such hospitals, and to give money in Alms, in
as large manner and form as they are bounden, or owen to do any thing in this
statute to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.

And lastly in anno 11. Caroli ca. 4. in Ireland it is ordained, for the better
suppressing of Rogues, Vagabonds, and other idle and disorderly persons that
before the Feast of Saint Michael the Archangell which shall be in the year of
our Lord God, one thousand six hundred thirty and six, there shall be erected,
built, or otherwise provided within every County of this realm of Ireland, one
or more fit and convenient house or houses of correction, with convenient
backside thereunto adjoining, together with Mils, working cards, and other
necessary implements, to set the said Rogues, and other idle and disordered
persons on work, the same houses to be built, erected or provided in some
convenient place or Town in every County, which houses shall be purchased,
conveyed or assured unto such person or persons, as by the Justices of peace,
or the more part of them in their quarter Sessions of the peace, to be holden
within every county of this Realm of Ireland shall be thought fit upon trust,
to the intent that the same shall be used and employed for the keeping,
correcting, and setting to work of the said Rogues, Vagabonds, sturdie beggars
and other idle persons.

And it is further enacted by the authority aforesaid (that if the said house
and houses respectively so to be erected, purchased or provided shall not be
erected, built or otherwise provided before the said feast of Saint Michael,
that then every Justice of peace, resident and dwelling within any County of
this realm, where such house and backside shall not be so erected and provided
shall forf. for his neglect Five pounds sterling, and so for every year which
shall ensue after the Feast of Saint Michael, wherein the said house and
backside shall not be erected and provided every such Justice of peace, as is
aforesaid, shall forf. 5.l. sterling, the one moitye of the said forfeitures,
to be unto him or them that will sue for the same, by action of debt, Bill,
plaint, or information, in which suit no protection, essoine or wager of law
shall be admitted, and the other moitie thereof to be employed and bestowed
toward the erection, building, procuring, or providing the same houses and
backsides respectively, and such necessary employments as aforesaid, and by the
said Act it is further ordained that the Justices of peace in every County
within this Realm, or the more party of them shall have power at any their
quarter Sessions of the peace within the said County to make such orders, as to
them or the more part of them from time to time shall be thought fit, for the
raising of money upon the inhabitants of the said County for erecting, or
providing the said houses, and for the government and ordering the said houses
respectively, or for stocks of money for the setting to work such persons as
shall be committed to the same, or for the yearly payment of such officers, as
hereafter by this present Act shall be appointed for governor or governors of
the said house or houses, and for such other as they shall think fit to be
employed therein, and that the said Justices at their said Quarter Sessions,
wherein they shall set such order for the raising of money, as aforesaid, shall
then and so yearly afterward nominate and appoint one sufficient man,
inhabiting in the said County to be and be called the treasurer of the
receiving and paying out of such moneys as shall be collected for the said
houses, or for the use of them, and the said treasurer so elected to continue
for the space of one whole year in this office, and then to give up his
charge, with a due account of his receipts and disbursements at the quarter
Sessions to be holden next after the Feast of Saint Michael every year in the
presence of two Justices of peace, to such other as shall be from year to
year successively elected treasurer, and if any man chosen, as aforesaid,
shall refuse to accept or execute the said office of treasurership, that then
it shall be lawful for the Justices of peace in their quarter Sessions, or in
their defaults for the Justices of Assise at the Assizes to be holden in the
same County to fine the said treasurer by their discretion, the same fine not
to be under three pounds sterling, which shall be levied by sale of his goods,
by virtue of a warrant to be given for that and by the said Justices, to such
person or persons as they shall think fit, which fine so levied, to be to the
use and toward the maintenance of the said house of correction.

And it is further enacted that the Justices of peace of every County within
the realm of Ireland at their quarter Sessions of the peace to be holden for
their several Countyes (next after the erecting, providing, or building of the
said house or houses, and so from time to time) or the most part of them, shall
elect, nominate and appoint, at their will and pleasure, one or more honest,
fit person or persons, to be governor or master of the said house, or houses,
so to be purchased, erected, built, or provided, which person or persons so
chosen by virtue of this present Act, shall have power and authority to set
such Rogues, Vagabonds, idle and disorderly persons as shall be brought and
sent unto the said house to work and labor (being able) from time to time for
such time as they shall continue and be remaining in the said house of
correction, and to punish the said Rogues, Vagabonds, idle and disorderly
persons, by putting fetters or ginnes upon them, and by moderate whipping of
them, and that the said Rogues, Vagabonds, and idle persons, during such time
as they shall remain in the said house of correction, shall in no sort be
chargeable to the Country, for any allowance either at their bringing in or
going forth, or during the time of their abode there, but shall have such and
so much allowance as they shall deserve by their own labor and work; And for
that it is convenient that the masters and governors of the said houses of
correction, shall have some fit allowance and maintenance for their travail
and care to be had in the said service, as also for the releiving of such as
shall happen to be weak and sick in their custody. It is therefore enacted
that the masters or governors of the said houses of correction shall have such
sum of money paid him yearly as shall be thought meet by the most part of
the Justices of peace within the said County at their quarter Sessions of the
peace, the same to be paid quarterly before hand, by the treasurer aforesaid,
during the time that the said masters or governors shall be employed in the
service, the said master or governor giving sufficient security for the
continuance and performance of the said service, which if the Treasurer shall
neglect or refuse to perform, then the said master or governor of the said
house of correction, shall by warrant from any two Justices of the peace of the
said County levye such sum or sums of money as ought to be paid to the said
master or governor, by distress and sale of so much of the said treasurers
goods, as the said money which shall be behind does amount unto, rendering to
the said treasurer the overplus, if any shall remain; and in defect of such
distress, it shall be lawful for any two Justices of peace as aforesaid to
commit the said treasurer to the County jail of the County, there to remain
without bail or mainprise, until payment be had of such sums as is behind
to the said master and governor, provided always that before any such warrant
be granted for distraining of the said treasurers goods, or committing of his
body, that it shall appear before the said Justices of peace, either by
confession of the party, or by testimony of two sufficient witnesses in the
presence of the treasurer, that he has so much money in his hands appertaining
to the said uses as may satisfy the said masters or governor, and because
there shall be the more care taken by all such masters of the houses of
correction, that when the Country has been at trouble and charge to bring
all such disorderly persons, as aforesaid, to their safe keeping, that then
they shall perform their duties in that behalf; It is therefore enacted that
if they shall not every quarter Sessions yield a true and lawful account to
the Justices of peace of all such persons as have been committed to their
custody, or any of them shall be troublesome to the Country by going abroad,
or otherwise shall escape away from the said house of correction, before they
shall be from thence lawfully delivered, that then the said Justices shall set
down such fynes and penalties upon the said masters and governors, as the most
part of them in their quarter Sessions shall think fit and convenient, and all
fynes and penalties not herein before limited shall be paid unto the treasurer
and accounted for, by the treasurer aforesaid, and further that the said
Justices of peace of every County, or any two or more of them, twice in every
year at the least, and oftener if there be occasion, shall assemble and meet
together, for the better execution of this statute, and that some four or five
days before their assembly and meeting, the said Justices or the more part of
them, shall by their warrant, command the Constables of every Barony, Town,
Parish, Village, and hamlet, within the said County, or so many of them, as
they in their discretions shall think fit, which shall be assisted with
sufficient men of the same places, to make a general privy search in one
night, within their said Barronies, Towns, Parishes, villages, and hamlets,
for the finding out, and apprehending of the said Rogues, Vagabonds, wandering
and idle persons, and that such Rogues, Vagabonds, wandering and idle persons as
they shall then find and apprehend in the said search, shall by them be
brought before the said Justices, at their said assembly and meeting there, to
be examined of their idle and wandering life, there to be punished according to
a statute in the 33. year of King H. 8. in this kingdom, against Vagabonds,
or otherwise by their warrant, to be sent or conveyed unto the said house or
houses of correction within the said County, appointed and prefixed, there to
be delivered to the master or governor of the said house, or to his Deputy or
assignee, to be set to labor and work, at which days and times of assembly
and meeting, so to be held by the said Justices of peace, the Constables of the
said Barronies, Parishes, Towns, Villages, and hamlets, shall then appear
before the said Justices of peace, at the said assemblies or meetings, and
there shall account and reckon upon oath in writing what Rogues, Vagabonds, and
wandering disorderly persons they have apprehended both in the same search, and
also between every such assemblies and meetings, and how many have been by
them punished, or otherwise sent unto the houses of correction, which if the
said Constables shall neglect to perform, as also to convey safely all such
Rogues, with all other idle or disorderly persons, at the charge of the
Constablewicke as by the Justices of peace warrants, shall be sent unto the
houses of correction in the same County, that then they shall forfeite such
further fynes, pains and penalties, as by the said Justices of peace or the
most part of them shall be thought fit and convenient, not exceeding the sum
of Forty shillings for every offense: And it is further enacted that all
persons calling themselves scholars, going about begging, all idle persons
going about in any Country, either begging or using any subtle craft, or
unlawful games or plays, or feigning themselves to have knowledge in
Phisiognomie, Palmestry, or other like crafty science, or pretending that they
can tell destinies, fortunes, or other like fantastical imaginations, all
persons that be, or utter themselves to be proctors, procurers,
patentgatherers, or collectors for gaoles, prisons, or hospitals, all Fencers,
Bearewards, common players of enterludes and minstrels wandering abroad, all
Iuglers, all wandering persons and common laborers, being persons able in body,
using loytering, and refusing to work for such reasonable wages as is taxed
and commonly given in such parts, where such persons do, or shall happen to
abide or dwell, not having living otherwise to mainetaine themselves, all
persons delivered out of gaoles, that beg for their fees, or otherwise
travel begging, all such persons as shall wander abroad, pretending loss by
fire, or otherwise, all such as wandering pretend themselves to be Egyptians, or
wander in the habit, form or attire of counterfeit Egyptians, shall be taken,
adjudged and deemed Rogues, Vagabonds, and sturdy beggars, and shall sustain
such punishments, as are appointed by the said statute made in the three and
thirtieth year of King Henry the Eighth, cap. 15. in this kingdom, against
Vagabonds, or be otherwise dealt withal, by sending them to the house of
correction in the County where they shall be found, as to the Justices of peace
of the said County, or to any one, or more of them shall be thought fit, and
for that many wilful people, finding that they have children, have some hope
to have relief from the Parish wherein they have dwelled, and being able to
labor, and thereby to relieve themselves and their families, do nevertheless
run away out of their Parishes; and leave their families upon the Parish, for
remedy whereof it is enacted that all such persons so running away shall be
taken and deemed to be incorrigible Rogues and endure the pains of
incorrigible rogues, and if either such man or woman being able to work and
shall threaten to run away and leave their families, as aforesaid, the same
being proved by two sufficient witnesses, upon oath, before two Justices of
peace in the County where they dwell or whither they run, that then the said
person so threatening shall by the Justices of peace be sent to the houses of
correction, unless he or she can put in sufficient sureties for the discharge
of the Parish, there to be dealt with as a sturdy and wandering Rogue, and to be
delivered by the said Justices at any of their meetings, or at their quarter
Sessions, and not otherwise.

And it is further enacted that if any Action of Trespass, or other suite,
shall happen to be attempted and brought against any person or persons for
taking of any distress, making of any sale, or any other thing doing by
authority of this present Act, the defendant or defendants in any such Action
or suite, shall and may either plead not guilty, or otherwise make avowry,
cognizance, or justification for taking of the said distress, making of sale,
or other thing doing by virtue of this Act, alleging in such avowry,
cognizance or justification, that the said distress, sale, trespass, or other
thing whereof the plainetiffe or plainetiffes complained, was done by authority
of this Act, and according to the tenor, purport and effect of this Act without
any expressing or rehearsal of any other matter or circumstance contained in
this present Act, to which avowry, cognizance, or justification the plainetiffe
shall be admitted to reply, that the defendant did take the said distress,
made the said sale, or did any other Act of Trespass supposed in his
declaration of his own wrong, without any such cause alleged by the
defendant, whereupon the issue in every such Action shall be joined, to be
tried by verdict of twelve men, and upon the trial of that issue, the whole
matter to be given on both parties in Evidence, according to the very truth of
the same, and after such issue tried, for the defendant or nonsuite of the
plainetiffe, the sad defendant shall recover treble damages, by reason of his
wrongful vexation in that behalf, with his costs also in that part sustained,
and that to be assessed by the same Jury, or by writ to enquire of damages as
the same cause shall require.

And it is further enacted that the Justices of Assize, in their several
circuits, shall have full power to enquire of all defects, defaults, and
negligences of any Justice of peace, or any other officer, person or persons
whatsoever, in the not due execution of this Law, and also of all offenses done
contrary to the intent and true meaning thereof, and to punish the same by fine
or imprisonment, or otherwise according to their discretions.

Surety for the peace. CHAP. 56.
1. Dalton 140.
Surety for the peace is the acknowledging of a Recognisance (or bond) to the
King taken by a competent Judge of Record for the keeping of the peace, and it
is called surety, of the word securitas, because the party that was in fear is
thereby the more secure and safe.

2. This surety for the peace, F. N. B. 7. 9. h. Lamb. 77.
every Justice of peace may take and command in two manners, or by a twofold
authority.

3. First, as a Minister, commanded thereto by a higher authority, as when a
writ of supplicavit, directed out of the Chancery or Kings Bench, is delivered
to his hands, upon this writ, that Justice of peace, only (to whom such writ
was delivered) is to direct his warrant to cause the party to be brought before
him alone, to find sureties for the peace, and therein the said Justice is to
do in every behalf, according as the writ does direct him.

4. Secondly, as a Judge, (and by virtue of his office) and of his own power
derived from his Commission, he may command this surety of the peace to be
found, and that either of his own motion and discretion, or else at the
request or prayer of another.

5. The Justice of peace upon his own motion and discretion may (if he see
cause) command surety for the peace to be found or may bind a man to the peace
(and that against all the Kings subjects, Upon discreton. Dalton 141.
if the Justice shall so think fit) in these cases following.

6. One that makes an assault, or affray upon the Justice of peace himself,
the Justice of peace may commit him to prison, 5. H. 7. 6.
till he has found sureties for the peace or if he please for the good
behavior.

7. So of such as in his presence shall make an affray upon another, P. R. 18.
19.
or shall stricke, or assault or offer to stricke another.

8. So he may do of such as in his presence and hearing shall threaten to
kill, beat or hurt another, or to burn his house.

9. So likewise may he do of such as in his presence, shall contend in hot
words, P. R. 1^.
for from thence oftentimes do ensue affrayes and batteries, and sometimes
mischiefs, yea manslaughters and murders.

See Cromp. 761. 142. P. R. 4.
10. So also may he do of such as shall in his presence go or ride armed
offensively or with an unusual number of servants or attendants, for these are
accounted to be in affray and fear of the people, and a means of the breach
of the peace, so of servants and laborers that shall bear any weapons,
contrary to the statute of 20. R. 2. ca. 1.

9. Ed. 4. 3. P. R. 18.
11. Also he may bind to the peace any other person by him suspected to be
inclined to the breach of the peace.

12. If (out of the presence of the Justice of peace) any man shall threaten to
kill, Cromp. 135. and 143. P. R. 22.
maime, or beat another, or do attempt or go about to do it, then any
Constable (being present, or at the prayer of the other party) may arrest such
offender to come before a Justice of peace to find sureties for the peace,
Fit. bar. 202.
and the Justice may bind him to the peace.

13. If any Constable shall perceive any other persons, in his presence, 14. H.
7. 7.
to be about to break the peace, either by drawing weapons or by stricking or
assaulting one another, or by assaulting the Constable himself, he may take
assistance, and carry them all before the Justice to find sureties for the
peace, and the Justice may bind them accordingly, and for default of sufficient
sureties the Justice of peace may commit them to the jail, until they find
such security.

14. If the Constable shall learn that certain persons be fighting or
quarrelling in a house, P. R. 22.
he may break open the doors and arrest them, and bring them before a Justice
of peace to find surety of the peace, and the Justice may bind them to the
peace or in default of such sureties commit them to the jail.

Dalton 141.
15. Yea, the Justice of peace (either upon his own discretion or upon any man's
complaint) may make his warrant, for any such as have made an affray, though
out of his presence, and may bind them to the peace or commit in default of
sufficient sureties.

16. If one has received a wound the Justice of peace may take surety of the
peace of the one, See Br peace 21.
and the other (by his discretion) until the wound be cured, and the malice be
over, Popham the Lord chief Justice of England (an honorable and grave Judge)
did accordingly between James and Benton at Cambridge Assizes, 3. Iacobi.

17. All such as shall go or ride armed offensively in faires, markets, 2. Ed.
3. ca. 3:
or elsewhere, or shall wear or carry any guns, daggs or pistols charged,
Dalton. 142.
in disturbance of the peace or terror of the people, any Constable seeing this
may arrest them, and may bring them before any Justice of peace, and the
Justice may bind them to the peace, yea though those persons were so armed or
weaponed for their defense, for they might have had the peace against the other
persons whom they feared, and besides, it strikes a fear and terror in the
Kings subjects.

18. Also the Justice of peace (upon his discretion) may bind to the peace a
common Barretor, Ibid.
and so he may Riotters.

19. If he that stands bound to keep the peace has broken, 21. Ed. 4. 40.
or forfeited his recognisance, the Justice of peace ought, and may of his
discretion, to bind him anew, but that must not be done until the party be
convicted of the breach of the peace, upon his recognisance, for before his
conviction it rests indifferent whether the recognisance be forfeited or no,
but after that he is thereof convicted, Br. peace 17.
the recognisance is utterly determined, Cromp. 42.
and then he is to be compelled to find new surety, or else to be sent to the
jail.

20. So it seems if the Justice of his own knowledge know that the party
which was bound has sithence his entering into bonds broken the peace, he shall
be bound of new, and if he refuse to find new sufficient sureties he shall be
committed to prison, Cromp. 141. and Br. recog. 21.

21. Also he that stands bound to keep the peace, Dalton 14^.
if his sureties be insufficient, the same Justice or another Justice of the
peace may compel him to find better sureties, or else commit him to the jail.

22. And in many of the former cases, the Justice of peace ought (of duty, or
at least in good discretion) to command the surety for the peace although the
same be not required by any other person, and if any such person shall refuse
to give such surety, the Justice of peace ought to send him to prison, there to
remain until he shall find such surety.

23. 9. Ed. 4. 3. Br. peace 8.
If a Justice of peace (upon his own discretion) shall cause one to be
arrested to find sureties for the peace, and shall after let him go without
taking surety, or binding him to the peace, yet the party has no remedy, for
an Action will not lie against the Justice of peace, he being a Justice of
Record, See 9. H. 6. fo. 60. and 9. Ed: 4. fo. 3. Br. Judges 2. 10.

24. A Justice of peace may persuade a man to require the surety of peace
against another, and he himself may grant a warrant for it, P. R. 18. Dalton
143.
because it is no more then he might have granted of his own authority without
any demand made, and it shall be presumed that he saw cause to do all this.

25. Also at the request or prayer of another, Upon request.
the Justice of peace may command this surety of the peace, and may grant his
warrant for it.

26. But here the Justice of peace must and ought to take an oath of the party
that demands the peace, F. N. B. 7^. ^.
which oath must be to this effect, scil. that he stands in fear of his
life, Dalton 143.
or of some bodily hurt to be done to himself, or to have his houses burned
(and that he does not crave the peace, for any private malice, or for vexation,
but of very fear, and for the needful safety of his body, or houses) for the
words of the Commission herein are, Et ad omnes illes qui alicui vel aliquibus
de populo nostro, de corporibus suis, vel de incendio domorum suarum, minas
fecerint ad sufficientem securitatem de pace, etc. inveniendam, etc.

27. So as he that shall be threatened to be hurt in his body, scil. to be
beaten, Ibid.
wounded, maimed, or killed, the party so threatened may crave and have the
surety of peace against the other.

Ibid.
28. Also if a man do fear that another will kill, maime, beat, assault, or
hurt him in body; he may crave the peace against such other person.

29. So if a man do fear that another will burn his house.

30. So if a man do fear that one will procure or cause any such hurt to be
done him by another, Ibid.
either in his body, or in his house, for the words of the recognisance be, non
faciet neque fieri procurabit.

Ibid.
31. So if a man lies in wait to beat, kill, or hurt another it is good cause
to require this surety, Cromp. 135.

Ibid.
32. If a man be threatened to have his goods burned, it seems by the opinion
of Master Fitz. that he may demand surety of the peace for this.

17. Ed. 44. Br. peace 22.
33. But where a man shall threaten to imprison another, it is holden that the
peace shall not be granted, for this may be intended to be by legal process,
but if one shall threaten another of his own wrong without any legal process
to Imprison him by force and violence; it seems to me that this is good cause
not only to grant security for the peace, but also for the good behavior, for
to threaten such imprisonment is within the words minas de corporibus, and like
harm may happen to a man by hard imprisonment, as by cruel beating of him,
and to threaten such imprisonment seems to be a good cause to avoid a deed,
as well as to threaten to kill or maime one, etc. 39. H. 6. Br. Duress. 9.

Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 80. g. Dalton 144.
34. Where a master is in fear that another will hurt his servants, or his
Cattle, or other goods, this surety of the peace shall not be granted by the
Justice of peace, but in this case Master Fitzherbert says, the party may have
a special writ out of the Chancery directed to the Sheriff, that he shall
cause such person to find surety that he shall do no hurt nor damage to the
other man in his body, or to his servants or goods, and if he will not find
surety, that then he shall arrest and detain him in prison, until he shall
find surety, and that the Sheriff shall certify all that he shall do
thereupon into the Chancerie, etc. and it seems the Sheriff ought to take
such surety by recognisance, and yet if a man shall threaten to hurt my
servant, or my wife, or child, I see no cause but that in their behalf I may
crave the peace at the Justices hands, by the words of the Commission, and that
the Justice ought to do it.

35. If a man will require the peace, because he is at variance or in suite
with his neighbor, it shall not be granted by the Justice of peace.

Br. Impris 41. P.R. 14.
36. Note also that the surety for the peace shall not be granted but where
there is a fear of some present, or future danger, and not merely for a
battery, or trespass that is past, or for any breach of the peace that is
past, for this surety of the peace is only for the security of such as are in
fear; ^^^^^metus, est presentis vel futuri periculi causa mentis trepidatio,
so this surety is providere praesentia and futura, and non praeterita.

37. And as for a battery or other like trespass that is past, Dalton 144.
the party wronged may have his Action of trespass or battery, etc. or may
punish the offender by indictment at the Kings suit, and yet in such case the
Justice may, if the party hurt do pray it, or upon any good circumstance if he
see cause, bind the party that made the affray to the peace.

38. If the Justice of peace shall perceive that this surety for the peace is
demanded merely of malice or for vexation only, Ibid.
without any just cause of fear, it seems he may safely deny it as in common
experience we find it, that where A. shall upon just cause come and crave the
peace against B. and has it granted to him, when B. shall come before the
Justice, B. likewise will crave the peace against A. and will perhaps surmise
some cause, but yet will nevertheless be content to surcease his suit and
demand against A. so as A. will relinquish to have the peace against him, here
the Justice of peace shall do well, as I think, not to be too forward in
granting the peace thus required by B. but to persuade with him, and to show
him the danger of his oath which he is to take, but yet if B. will not be
persuaded, but will take his oath that he is in fear (where indeed he neither
does fear nor has cause to fear) the Justice may if he please upon such oath
to grant the peace, and this oath shall discharge the Justice, and the fault
shall remain upon the party, but in such case I think it better discretion in
the Justice to forbear taking of such oath and the security for the peace then
to grant it.

39. The Law has conceived such an opinion of the peaceable disposition of
noble men, Noble men.
that it has been thought enough to take one of their promises upon his
honor, that he would not break the peace against a man, Br. contempts 6. 24.
Ed. 3. 3. and 17. Ed. 4. 4.

40. And therefore if a man shall have cause to have the surety of the peace
against a Lord of the Parliament, or such great and noble personage, he shall
not have a warrant from the Justices of peace to that purpose, nor yet have a
supplicavit out of the Chancery directed to the Justices of peace therefore,
but if there be cause he may have a Sub poena out of the Chancery, of common
right, as it seems, and there such Lord or noble man shall be bound to the
peace, and yet if such Lord will not appear upon the Sub poena served, Fitz.
subp. 20.
it seems an attachment will lie against him upon such his default, Master
Cromp. fo. 134. b. says that it was held in the case of the Lord Cromwell in
the Chancery about 18. Eliz. that an attachment lies not against a Lord where
he makes default upon a Sub poena against him out of the Chancery, Dyer 315.
seems to accord, but I conceive that this opinion is no Law, but that for a
personal contempt in a noble man an attachment lies, or he may be fined by
the Court for his contempt.

Co. 6. 53. 54. 11. H. 4. 15. Br. Rep. 19.
41. But though it be true that the persons of Barons (who are peers of the
Parliament) shall not be arrested (for, or in cases of debt or trespass) by
their bodies, first in respect of their dignity, secondly, that the Law
presumes that they have sufficient lands and tenements wherein they may be
distrained, yet in cases of contempt it seems they may be arrested by capias,
or attachment, etc.

Fitz. subp. 20.
42. Or else it seems that the party may crave the peace in the Chancery
against such Lord or peer, sc. to have a supplicavit directed to the Sheriff,
and that the Sheriff may and ought to execute the same, and that if the
Sheriff shall not do his office therein, an alias plur. attachment lies
against him, F.N.B. 79. g.
and if the Sheriff shall return, that such Lord is puissant, that he cannot
arrest him upon such return, the Sheriff shall be grievously amerced (for he
might have posse comitatus, sc. he might have levied 300. men by his
discretion, if there had been need, Crom p. 134.
to have aided him in such case) and if such Lord or peer who is by the
Sheriff so arrested, shall refuse the arrest, and shall make a rescous,
whereupon the Sheriff shall return a rescous, hereupon an attachment shall be
granted out against such Lord, to arrest and take his body for such his
contempt.

Co. 6. 52. 53.
43. The same Law and remedy seems to be, where a man has cause to have the
surety of the peace against a Duchess, Countess, or Baroness, for they are
Peers of the Realm, and shall be tried by their peers, although in respect
of their sex, they cannot sit in parliament, and they are in the same degree
(as concerning their nobility and the privileges incident to their dignities)
with Dukes, Earls, and Barons, but here note this diversity, sc. if such a
woman being a Countess, or Baroness, etc. by marriage only, shall marry
again under the degree of nobility she has thereby lost her name of dignity,
together with the privileges of her said nobility also, as it seems, for in
such a case, si mulier nobilis nupserit ignobili, deserit esse nobilis, Co.
ibid.
and that which was gotten by marriage may also be lost by marriage, for eodem
modo quo quid constituitur, dissolvitur, but if she be noble by birth or
descent, whomsoever she shall marry, yet she remains noble, for birthright
est character indelebilis.

44. And yet by the courtesy of England, if women get to any degree of estate,
they never lose it by marriage, but do still take place according to the
estate of their first husband; but this matter of courtesy has no place in
legal proceedings.

Dalton 146.
45. Surety of the peace may be granted by the Justice of peace against a
Knight, and against all other lay persons, being under the degree of a Baron or
peer of the Realm, and they shall be bound with sureties.

26. H. 6. 23. Br. Maigne. 14. and 15.
46. Ecclesiastical persons (if they be not attending upon divine service) may
be arrested for the peace, and they shall be bound with sureties, but whilst
they are doing any divine service in the Church, Churchyard, or other place
dedicated to God, they may not be arrested, 5. Ed. 3. 5. P. Arrests 1. See the
stat. 1. R. 2. cap. 15.

47. Surety of the peace may be granted against the Sheriff, Dalton 146.
Coroner, Escheator, and other such officers of Justice, but Master Marrow
advises that such persons be not bound, versus cunctum populum, but only
against such person, as shall demand it, least otherwise it should argue them
unworthy of their offices.

48. One Justice of peace may grant this surety to any man, Dalton 146. Lambert
f. 80.
against one of his fellow Justices, but great discretion is herein to be used,
otherwise he shall bring the office into contempt, and himself to reproof by
it, says Master Lambert, but although one Justice of peace may take a
recognisance of the peace of one of his fellow Justices, yet if his fellow
Justice shall refuse to find such security, I cannot conceive that the Justice
of peace may commit his fellow Justice, for inter pares non est potestas.

49. One Justice of peace may demand this surety of the peace at the hands of
his fellow Justice against another man.

50. The wife may demand this surety against her husband, Wife Fitz. 80. f.
Dalton 148.
if he shall threaten to kill her, or outragiously beat her, or if the wife
has any notorious cause to fear that he will do so, and it shall be granted
her by the Justice of peace, or she may have it by supplicavit in the
Chancery, Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 238. fo. Br. peace 23.

51. Ibid.
The husband for the like causes may demand surety for the peace against his
wife.

52. Dalton 147.
Also the Justice of peace upon his own discretion may in either of the
aforesaid cases between the husband and the wife, especially happening in his
presence, grant surety of the peace.

53. An Infant under the age of 14. years may demand this surety, Dalton 147.
and it shall be granted him.

54. Ibid.
Also this surety of the peace may be granted at the prayer of any person
against a feme covert, or against an Infant, though he be under fourteen
years of age, for if such an Infant has discretion to demand the peace, etc.
then has he discretion to break the peace.

55. Ibid.
But an Infant and a feme covert shall be bound by sureties only, and they
themselves shall not be bound, and if they cannot find sureties, they shall be
committed to prison until they have found sureties, and yet if an Infant shall
be bound to the peace, etc. by recognisance taken by a Justice of peace, Co.
10. 43. Cromp. 237. b.
it seems he shall be estoped to avoid such a record, if he does not avoid it
during his minority, for it is not void but voidable, by audita quaerela.

56. Dalton 147.
But if a feme covert shall be bound or acknowledge such a Recog. though her
husband join therein with her, yet it is merely void, as to the wife,
although she over lives her husband.

57. If a man be of non sanae memeriae, Ibid.
this surety shall neither be granted against him, nor to him upon his request,
and yet if there shall be cause, the Justice of peace upon his discretion,
ought to provide for his safety.

58. A man that is lunaticke, ( scil. who at some seasons has the use of
reason, and at other times not) it seems this surety of the peace may be
granted against him, and also that he may demand the same against another.

See Co. 4. 124. and 11. 77.
59. And if one of non sanae memoriae, or a lunaticke be himself bound by
recognisance before a Justice of peace to keep the peace, it seems such
recognisance shall bind them and all others for ever.

60. A man that is deaf, dumb, and blind, shall not have this surety, Dalton
147.
for he has no understanding to ask it, and yet such a person, or any other
person not having reason to demand the peace, if there because, the Justice of
peace upon his discretion ought to provide for their safety.

61. A man that is borne dumb and blind, may have understanding, Ibid.
and therefore it seems this surety may be granted to him, or against him.

62. But a man that is borne dumb and deaf can hardly have understanding, for
though the sight be the chiefest sense, yet by hearing we come chiefly to
knowledge, and therefore it seems not grantable to him or against him.

63. And this surety of the peace may be granted against an impotent person,
although he be such a one as is not like to break the peace himself, but he
may procure another to kill, or beat one, and the common form of recognisance
is to bind a man from procuring hurt, as well as from doing hurt.

Cromp. 134.
64. This surety of the peace may also be granted to or against a man attainted
of treason or felony.

65. A man excommunicate may have this surety granted to him or against him.

66. So also of a man that is abjured the Realm, for notwithstanding the
abjuration, he owes the King his legeance and remains within the Kings
protection, and the King may pardon and restore him again, qui abjurat regnum,
amittit regnum non regem, Co. 7. 9. b.

67. A man attainted in a praemunire may not have this surety granted to him in
Ireland, but in England he may have it, for by a statute made in England in
anno 5. El. ca. 1. It is ordained that it shall not be lawful to kill such a
one, but this statute is not of force in Ireland.

Cromp. 134: P.R. 19.
68. An alien borne, who is made Denizen, may have this surety, and so of an
alien borne who lives in England, under the Kings protection, although he be
not made Denizen.

Co. 7 17.
69. And so of an alien, whose King is in league with our King, or if there be
no wars between this Realm and that Realm whereof the alien is, for by the
common Law all these may get and have within this Realm any personal goods,
and may sue for the same, and so have the benefit of the Kings Laws and
protection, but an Alien who is the Kings enemy, Dyer. 2.
( scil. where there is open war between our King and his King) shall not
have such surety granted to him, nor any other benefit of the Kings Laws.

70. Who shall be said to be an Alien, See Co. 7. 16, 17.

71. In Calvin's case, 6. Co. 7. 18.
Iac. reg. there is a difference taken between antenati and postnati, in
Scotland, where it is holden that antenati in Scotland, sc. such as were borne
there before that Kings happy coming to the crown of England are here aliens
borne, the reason is, for that at the time of their birth they were under the
legeance of another King, and he could not be a Subject borne of the Kingdom
of England, that was borne under the legeance of a King of another Kingdom,
and yet it is manifest that antenati being the Kings Subjects, are herein
provided for, by the Commission it self, the words whereof are, and ad omnes
illos qui alicui vel aliquibus de populo nostro, etc. of which number antenati
be, so as they may and ought to have this surety granted them as well as any
other Subjects, See Dyer fo. 304.

72. But it may be questioned, whether an infidel, pagan, or Jew, Co. 7. 17.
shall have this security granted them, for in law they are perpetui inimici,
there is perpetual enmity between the Christians and them, and there can be
no peace, neither can they get any thing within this realm, nor maintain any
action at all, 12. H. 8. 4.

73. A villain may have this surety of the peace against his Lord, and the
Lord may have it against his villain, and yet it makes no manuimission,
although it were demanded by the Lord without any protestation, etc.

How this Surety of the peace may be commanded, and how the same commandment
shall be executed. CHAP. 57.
1. THe Justice of peace may command this surety of the peace, either by word
only or by writing.

2. By word only the party being in his presence, as if in the presence and
hearing of the Just. of peace one man does threaten another, or shall make an
affray, or assault upon another, 14. H. 7. 8.
or do some other like thing, tending to the breach of the peace, the Justice
of peace may command him by word to find sureties for the peace, and for want
of such sureties may commit him to prison until he shall find the sa^e.

3. Also if one shall demand this surety against another, 14. H. 7. ^.
who is then in the presence of the Justice of peace, and will be sworn that
he is affrayd of him, the Justice may by word command him to find sureties
for the peace.

4. And the Justice of peace in such cases, 14. H. 7. ^. ^.
may by word only command the Constable or any known officer (or his own
servant) being then present, to arrest such party to find sureties for the
peace, and if the party shall refuse to find such sureties, then the Justice
of peace may commit him to the jail.

5. By precept or warrant in writing and under seal, and this must be directed
to some officer or other indifferent person, By writing.
and must contain the cause, and at whose suit, to the intent the party to be
bound may provide his sureties, and take them with him; The form of which
precept, See postea tit. Warrants and Presidents.

Co. 5. 59.
6. The Justice of peace may make his warrant to bring the party before himself
to find surety for the peace, by the opinion of Wray chief Justice, Br.
peace 9.
for he that makes the warrant, for the most part, has the best knowledge of
the matter, and therefore is the fittest to do Justice in that case, and yet
the most usual manner is, to make such a warrant, to bring the party before
the same Justice or some other of the Justices of peace of the same County, 21.
H. 7. 21.
etc. and Judge Fineux his opinion was, that where a Justice of peace does make
a warrant for the party ex officio, there the party may choose to appear
before him, or any other Justice in that County, and that the party may have
his action of false imprisonment against the officer, if he do otherwise
compel him.

How it shall be executed. 5. Ed. 4. 13.
7. The Constable (or other officer) before he arresteth the party upon such a
warrant, ought first to acquaint him with the matter, and withal to require
the party in the Kings Name to go (with him) before the Justices to find
sureties according to the warrant, and if the party shall refuse either to go
before the Justice, P. R. 20. and Cromp. 235.
or to find sureties, then the officer may arrest him, by virtue of that
warrant, and may convey him to the jail, without carrying him to any Justice
of peace, and there the party shall remain, until he shall voluntarily offer
and find sureties.

8. But if the party shall yield to go and find sureties, then the officer
may not absolutely arrest him, but yet the officer is not bound to go up and
down with him to find sureties, but may keep the party until he can procure
sureties to come to him, yet if afterward the party shall make any resistance,
or shall offer to go his way, then the officer may arrest him, and by virtue
of that warrant, may carry him to the jail, and may also imprison him in the
stocks, until he can provide aid to convey him to the jail.

14. H. 7. f. 10. 2. Br. peace.
9. When the party comes before the Justice of peace by force of this warrant,
or by force of any other warrant for the peace, or good behavior, or for a
riot, or the like, the party must offer sureties to the Justice of peace or
else the Justice may commit him to the prison, for the Justice needs not to
demand surety of him.

10. Also after that the party shall be brought before the Justice, if before
him he shall refuse to find sureties, the officer without any new warrant or
commandment may carry the party to prison, co. 5. ^^.
and that by the words of the first warrant, (and if he shall refuse this to
do, that then, etc.) see the form of the warrant in the title of warrants and
presidents.

11. If the officer do arrest the party, 5. Ed. 4. 6. P. R. 20.
and do not carry him before some Justice of peace to find sureties, etc. or
upon the refusal of the party, if the officer shall arrest him, and do not
carry him to the jail, in both these cases, the officer is punishable by the
Justices of peace for this neglect (by fine at their Sessions) and also the
party arrested may have his Action of false imprisonment for the arrest, for
where the officer does not pursue the effect of his warrant, his warrant will
not excuse him of that which he has done, 21. H. 7. 23. a. See 3. H. 7. fo. 3.
b. Bryan.

12. And if the party be imprisoned for default of sureties, and after he that
demanded the peace against him happen to dye, or shall release the party, it
seems in these cases the Justice of peace may make his liberate or warrant
for the delivery of such prisoner, for after such death, or release, there
seems no cause to continue the other in prison, also any Justice of peace may
upon the offer of such prisoner, take surety of him for the peace, etc. and may
thereupon deliver him.

13. It seems by some opinions, 4. Ed. 4. ^6. 2. H. 7. 24. Br. privilege 35.
and 52. Lambert 96.
that if the party imprisoned for not finding sureties, has a suite depending
in the common place, he may by the course of that Court by a writ of privilege
be discharged of his imprisonment, if the other party be not ready in the Court
at the day of the return of the writ, to pray sureties of the peace, but if
upon the return of the habeas corpus the cause be returned as it ought to be
the Court will not discharge him without finding such surety, for he that
demands the peace is not to have notice of the removing of his body, and then
how can he be ready in the Court of common place at the day, and therefore it
were a hard case that he should be so defeated of his surety.

14. If the party has gotten sureties, then if the warrant proceed ex officio
(and not upon the writ of supplicavit) and be a general warrant, scil. to come
before me, or some other Justice, Co. 5. 59. Br. ex^mp. 11. Br. peace. 9.
the party may go before any other Justice of peace, to offer his surety, yet
he shall not enforce the officer to travel to a Justice out of the division or
limit where they be dwelling without good cause; Nay it is at the election of
the officer (who is the minister of Justice) to carry the party attached, to
any other Justice of peace that he will, for it is more reason to give this
election to the officer, who in presumption of Law is a person indifferent, and
is sworn to execute his office duly, then to give the election to the
delinquent himself, who by presumption will seek shifts, and to weary the
Officer.

15. If the other Justice of peace, before whom the party so attached shall
come, shall refuse to accept and take such surety being offered to him, this is
punishable in the Starchamber, for such Justice of peace ought to take of him
such sureties, and to bind him by recognisance, but yet that must be done in
such sort in all points, as the form of the former precept does require,
Supersedeas by a Justice of peace.
and thereupon the same other Justice of peace (having so taken surety for the
peace, may and ought upon request, to make his supersedeas to all officers, and
to all other the Justices of peace of the same County, and thereby the said
party shall be discharged from finding other surety, Cromp. 145.
and from any other arrest for the same cause, but by such supersedeas that
other Justice cannot dischardge the first warrant of the first Justice until
the party be bound indeed, nor can give any other day to the party to appear
at any other Sessions, etc.

Dalton 151.
16. Also a Justice of peace of the County by a Supersedeas cannot discharge a
warrant awarded by his fellow Justice by force of a supplicavit to him directed
out of the Chancerie or Kings Bench, to take the surety of the peace of one
resident in that County.

Ibid.
17. Also when a man does fear that surety of the peace will be demanded
against him in the Country, or does hear that such a warrant for the peace is
granted already out against him, by a Justice of peace, it seems in either
of these cases, he may go and give surety of the peace before any other
Justice of peace of the same County where he dwells, and thereupon may have a
supersedeas from that Justice of peace, etc. but in such case it is fit that
such party be urged by such Justice to put insufficient sureties, and that he
be bound toward the King, and all his people, and to appear at the next
Sessions.

Ibids.
18. If any officer having a warrant from a Just. of peace to arrest a man to
find surety of the peace, shall receive a supersedeas (out of the Chancerie,
or Kings Bench, or from any Justice of the Kings Bench, Dalton 152.
or from any Justice of peace of the County) to discharge the same surety of
the peace, Lamb. 101.
and yet nevertheless will urge the party (by force of his warrant) to find
(new) surety for the peace, the party may refuse to give it, and if he be
arrested or imprisoned for such refusal, he may have his action of false
imprisonment against such officer, for such supersedeas is a discharge of the
former precept or warrant.

19. The form of a Supersedeas granted by a Justice of peace you may see,
postea tit. Warrants and Presidents.

20. And this Supersedeas is sufficient, though it never name the sureties, nor
contain the fummes wherein they are bound, but yet it is the better form to
express them both.

F. N. B. 81. 2. and 238. Supersedeas from above.
21. If the party shall mislike to be (or stand) bound to the peace, by the
Justice of peace in the Country, then may he (either before, or after, that he
is bound in the Country) go or send up to Dublin, and there give surety for
the peace (either in the Kings Bench, or in the Chancerie) and thereupon the
party may have a Supersedeas (our of that Court) where he has given such
surety, to restrain the Justice of Peace of the Country from taking any
surety of the peace of him, and then the Justices of peace of the Country,
after the receipt of such Supersedeas, must forbear to make any warrant for
the peace against the party, and if any Justice of peace have granted out any
such warrant against the said party, the said Justice may make his Supersedeas
to the officers, thereby commanding them to surcease to put his former warrant
in execution, and so to discharge it and to discharge the party of any arrest,
or imprisonment thereupon.

21. The form of a Supersedeas for the peace out of the Kings Bench, See lib.
Intr. 454.

22. For the form of a Supersedeas for the peace, out of the Chancery, See
Fitz. Na. Br. 238. c. and Register 89.

23. Note that this Supersedeas out of the Chancery may be procured at any time
in the vacation, and out of the term, Fitz. Na. Br. 236. a.

24. If the Justice of peace shall not furcease, after a Supersedeas (out of
the Chancery, or Kings Bench) to him delivered, an attachment will lie against
him for such contempt, a^^ besides he may be fined and imprisoned for it.

25. Yea such a Supersedeas, coming out of those high Courts to the Justices
of peace, they ought thereupon to surcease, although such a Superdeas should be
awarded against Law.

26. If such Supersedeas shall be directed to the Justices of peace and
Sheriff, that Justice to whose hands it shall be delivered, may keep it and
may deliver the labell to the party.

27. And in these and like cases, Dalton 153.
the Justice of peace shall do well to send to the next general Sessions of
the peace, as well the said Supersedeas, if it come to his hands, as also the
recognisance which he has formerly taken of the party, if he had taken any,
for peradventure the recognisance was forfeited before the Supersedeas was
purchased, or if it were not forfeited, yet the conusor is not endamaged
thereby.

28. Ibid.
If the party shall procure such Supersedeas out of the Chancery, or Kings
Bench, after that he is bound by recognisance before the Justice of peace, to
keep the peace, etc. and to appear at the next Sessions, he ought to appear
in person and there show his Supersedeas, Cromp. 139.
and pray allowance of it, and thereupon he shall be discharged, but if he
fail to appear his recognisance will be forfeited notwithstanding his
Supersedeas.

29. But if the party were bound (before the Justice of peace) to keep the
peace against all men during his life, and not to appear, Dalton 153.
and shall after procure such a Supersedeas, testifying that he has found such
surety in the Chancery, etc. against all men for ever, and shall send this to
the Sessions, this shall discharge his bonds without his personal appearance at
the Sessions.

30. 28. H. 8. Dyer. ^o. 29.
A man being arrested by the Sheriff upon a capias found sureties for his
appearance at the day, and after there came a Supersedeas to the Sheriff, and
it was moved whether it were necessary for the defendant to appear or not, or
that this appearance and surety were discharged by the Supersedeas, Lib. Int.
453.
and the opinion of that Court was, that he ought to appear for the saving of
his bond, also the presidents of Entries are, that the party bound did show his
Supersedeas in Court and prayed allowance thereof, and was thereupon discharged.

Now concerning the recognisance for the peace. CHAP. 58.
1. THis recognisance Recognisance.
which the Justice takes for the keeping of the peace, is rather of congruence
then by any express authority given them, Fitz. Na. Br. 82. a. 7. H. 7. 34.

2. And this recognisance for the peace, if the Justice of peace does take it,
by force of the writ of supplicavit, then he ought to execute it, and to do in
all things as the writ directs him, but where such writ prescribes (...) the
same, etc. or such like, that rests in his own discretion.

3. But if he takes the recog. ex officio, and by force of the Commission (and
so is a Judge, not as a minister) then it rests in the discretion of the same
Justice of peace wholly to appoint and allow the number of sureties, their
sufficiency in lands or goods, the sum of money wherein they shall be bound,
and to limit the time how long the party shall be bound, and such other
circumstances.

7. H. 4. 34.
4. In the book 7. H. 4. fo. 34. you shall find the principal to be bound in
1000. l. and four sureties, every one of them in one thousand marks before
Justices of peace for the keeping of the peace.

5. The Justice of peace may examine upon their oaths the sureties concerning
their sufficiency, Br. imp. 18.
and that seems to be the usage in the Courts at Westminster, and Master
Crompton says, that the Justices of peace in their Sessions may do it. Cromp.
194.

6. The most usual manner, and safest way for the Justice of peace is to take
two sureties at the least (and those subsidy men) besides the party himself,
and to bind them by recognisance to the King, viz. domino Regi, and it must
always be for the keeping of the peace.

Lamb. 104.
7. And yet by the opinion of Master Marrow (who was in the time of King H. 7.)
a Justice of peace might have taken this surety by a gage pawned to him only,
but this is not the course at this day, but the security ought to be by
recognisance.

8. Also by his opinion a Justice of peace might have taken this surety by an
obligation made to himself by the name of a Justice of peace but this course
is not now in use, and the safest way is by recognisance, which is the usual
way, for via trita is via tuta, and to ground his proceeding upon conceits.

9. Yet if a Justice of peace had enjoined a man upon pain of 20. l. to keep
the peace, this had been nothing worth, but in this, F.N.B. 81. d.
and the former two cases, and the like, this one general ground or reason may
be given for all, sc. that a man cannot be bound to the King, but only by
matter of record, and therefore such surety taken by gage or obligation, or
such enjoining of the peace seems nothing worth to bind the party.

10. A Justice of peace may take a recognisance (and thereby may bind the
party) to keep the peace for one year, or for a longer time (by his
discretion) yea he may bind the party during his life, upon reasonable cause.

11. If the recognisance be made to keep the peace (generally) without any day
or time limited, it shall be construed to be during the parties life.

12. A Justice of peace intending to take a recognisance for the peace, and yet
makes no mention therein, Dalton 155.
nor in the condition thereof, that it is for the preservation of the peace, it
seems to be void, as being taken coram non judice, for a Justice of Peace
has no authority to take a recognisance generally, but for matters concerning
his office specially.

13. If the Recognisance be, that the party bound shall not beat nor maime A.
yet it is not good, Ibid.
because it ought to be for the keeping of the peace, generally, and the peace
may be broken by burning the house of A. or the like.

14. If the Recognisance do not limit any time of appearance, but be generally
to keep the peace, yet it is good, for the time of appearance is referred to
the discretion of the Justice, and the chief scope is, the keeping of the
peace by Master Marrow.

15. Also, by his opinion, if the Recognisance do limit a time of appearance,
but therein is no person named, before whom the party so found shall appear,
then may he appear where he will, before that Justice of peace which took the
recognisance, ibidem. but in that case I think the Condition is void by
reason of the incertainty.

16. But in the two last cases, if a recognisance should be taken in such manner
at this day, I should think it safe for the party to appear at the next
Sessions for the peace, and there to record his appearance, but to avoid these
doubts, let the Justice of peace express that the party shall appear before
his Majesty's Justices of peace at the next general Sessions of the peace to
be holden in that County, or at the next general Assise and jail delivery
before his Majesty's Justices of jail delivery in that County, and in so doing
these scruples are avoided.

17. If the Recognisance be to appear at any other Sessions after (and not at
the next Sessions) yet the Recognisance is good, Crom. 141. P. Just. 106.
and yet by the statute of 3. H. 7. cap. 1. It is enacted that every
Recognisance taken for the peace, by the Justice of peace ex officio shall be
certified ( sc. sent or brought in) at the next Sessions of the peace, and
there delivered to the Custos Rotulorum, or else the Justice of peace is
fineable, but it does not therefore follow that every Recognisance taken for
the peace ought to be to appear at the next Sessions, but that it ought to be
brought in, and then the party may be called at the time expressed in the
Recognisance and not before.

18. If the Recognisance be in Twenty pounds to be levied of his lands only, or
of his goods only, yet it is good, and these words (only may seem void) for
the acknowledgement of the Recognisance (before a competent Judge) both makes
it a debt, Dalton 1 55.
and implies the ordinary means of Law to come to it.

19. If the Recognisance be to keep the peace toward the King, and all his
people, but not toward any person certain, yet it is good.

20. So if the Recognisance be to keep the peace toward A. only, F.N.B. 80.
g. Cromp. 141.
it is good, or to keep the peace toward A. and his servants, without being
bound toward the King, and all his Subjects, it is good enough.

21. But the best form is to bind the party to keep the peace toward the
King and all his people, for first the words of the Commission are to find
surety, erga nos and populum nostrum, and again, the common usage is so, and
besides it may prove dangerous to the party who has cause to crave this surety
of the peace, for the other party who shall give just cause to crave this
surety against him (because he will not be bound to the peace toward him that
prays it) he will perhaps pray to bind himself to the peace to A. who is his
Companion, and then if the Justice of peace shall so bind him, then may he and
A. go to another Justice of peace (and that peradventure within one week) and
there A. may release him of the peace, and so the party that first prayed the
peace, trusting that he is still bound, may be after beaten, maimed, or slain
by him or by his procurement.

22. So then though the Recognisance being taken in any manner or sort aforesaid
may prove sufficient to bind the party to the King, yet peradventure it will
not excuse the Justice of peace from blame, and therefore it is safest for the
Justice of peace to follow the received form.

23. The form of the Recognisance for the Peace you shall see postea tit.
Warrants and Presidents.

24. The Recognisance for the peace being thus taken, if it were by a writ of
supplicavit, the Justice ought to return the writ, and to certify, under his
Seal, his doing therein into the Court from whence the supplicavit proceeded,
and he may also send such Recognisance, so taken by him, with this certificate,
or else he may keep the Recognisance in his hands still, until he shall
receive a Certiorari out of the Chancerie directed to him for removing of this
Recognisance.

25. But if this recognisance for the peace were taken by the Justice of peace
ex officio, 3. H. 7. ca. 1. P. Just. 106.
then the Justice of peace ought to certify (send or bring) the Recognisance
to the next Sessions of the peace, so that the party bound may be called
thereupon, and that if the party make default of appearance, the same default
may be then recorded, and the recog. with the record of such default shall be
estreated into the Exchequer, 3. H. 7. ca 1. Recog. forf.
that from thence process may go out against the party, and so ought it to
be, if it be presented that the party has forfeited his recognisance, by
breach of the peace.

26. If the Justice of peace shall not certify such recog. at the next
Sessions by the said stat. 3. H. 7. ca. 1. he is to be fined at the discretion
of the Court, and yet see Brook tit. Peace 11. that the Justice shall forfeit
10. l. if he shall not certify the Recog. of the peace at the next Sessions,
but Brook there mentions the stat. 3. H. 7. ca. 3. which stat. of 3. H. 7.
ca. 3. was only for bailement of prisoners and certifying the same, and not for
Bonds of the peace.

27. Cromp. 169.
If he which demanded the peace shall release the peace before the next
Sessions, yet the Justice of peace ought to certify the Recog. together with
the Release, for peradventure it was forfeited before the Release made.

28. 2. H. 7. 1. ^^^. 11. Fit. N. B. 8. 1. Recognisance removed.
Also he that demands this surety may by a Certiorari remove such Recog.
into the Chancerie before the Justice has certified the same to the Sessions,
and then the Justice shall be excused for not certifying the same to the
Sessions.

29. If the Justice of peace were deceived in the sufficiency of the sureties,
Dalton 157.
the same Justice of peace or any other Justice of peace may afterward compel
the party to find and put in more sufficient surety, and may take a new Recog.
for the same, for that the precept is ad inveniendum sufficientem securitatem,
but if the sureties dye, the party principal shall not be compelled to find
new sureties.

What thing shall discharge this Recognisance (of the peace) or the party of
his appearance at the Sessions. CHAP. 59.
1. A Supersedeas out of the Chancerie, etc. will not discharge the party of
his appearance, but he ought to appear and show the Supersedeas in Court, and
thereupon he shall be discharged, as is before declared in this Title.

2. He that is bound to the peace, and to appear at a certain day, 30. H. 6.
26.
he must appear at the day, and record his appearance, Br. s^rety ^^.
although he who craved the peace comes not in to desire that it may be
continued, otherwise the recog. shall be forfeited.

3. And if a man be bound to keep the peace toward the King, and all his
people, but not toward any certain person, and to appear at such a Sessions,
the Court at that Sessions may make Proclamation, etc. and if no person comes
to demand the peace against him, then the Court may discharge him, but if a man
be bound as aforesaid, and especially to keep the peace toward A. there
though A. comes not in, to desire that the peace may be continued, yet the
Court by their discretion shall do well to bind him over till the next
Sessions, and that may be, to keep the peace against A. only if they shall
think good, for it may be that A. who first craved the peace is sick, or
otherwise let, so as he cannot come to that Sessions, to demand the
continuance of the peace.

4. If the Justice of peace shall not certify the recog. to the Sessions, yet
the party ought to appear, and to record his appearance, for if a Sheriff
arrest one upon a capias, and take bonds for his appearance, at the day the writ
is returneable, and the Sheriff returns not his writ, etc. yet the party must
appear to save his bond 18. Ed. 4. 18.

Cromp. 134.
5. If the party that is bound to appear be so sick as that he cannot appear,
nor by any means travel at the day, upon due proof of such his sickness,
the Justices of peace shall forbear to certify or record such default, for
impotentia in this and such like cases by the hand of God excusat legem.

Cromp. 144.
6. If the husband be bound that he and his wife shall appear at such a
Sessions, and that they shall keep the peace in the mean time, etc. and at
the day the husband does appear, but not his wife, here Master Cromp. says
the recog. is not forfeited, for if there shall be cause to continue the peace
against the husband and wife still, the husband shall be bound and not the
wife, and therefore the wives personal appearance seems not greatly material.

21. Id. 4. 40.
7. If a man be bound to the peace during his life, or generally without any
time or day limited, it seems that neither the King the Justice of peace nor
the party can discharge this recog. during the life of the party so bound, by
release or otherwise. Br. peace 17.

8. The Justice of peace who upon his own discretion has compelled him to
find sureties of the peace until a certain day, and has taken recog. for
his appearing, etc. may upon the like discretion release the same before the
day, and such a release will discharge the recog. taken by that Justice if it
were not forfeited before, but yet the Justice of peace ought to certify the
Recognisance together with his release, and this certificate will discharge the
appearance of the party.

9. If a Justice of peace shall grant the peace at the request of another (
scil. at the suite of A.) and the recognisance be taken to keep the peace
against B. only, then before the next Sessions may B. only release it, and none
other, and that release being certified with the recognisance at the next
quarter Sessions, will discharge the party so bound of his appearance, so as he
shall not be called upon his recog. for that release being so certified, is now
become of record as well as the recognisance.

10. B^ p^^^^ 17.
If the Recog. were to keep the peace versus cunctum populum, and precipue
versus A. yet may the same A. release it, for although this may seem popular,
and that all others should have interest therein as well as A. yet it appears
by the word precip^^e that it was especially taken for his safety, but the
contrary was holden by all the Justices 21. Ed. 4. 40. says Master Lambert,
nevertheless the usage now is and long has been that A. may release the
peace, but having perused the book in 21. Ed. 4. fo. 40. I find the word
precipue is not there, but it is toward A. and cunctum populum; So as that
opinion may be Law, and yet not contrary to the common usage, for the word
precipue does appropriate the recognisance to be chiefly for the safety of him
that prays the peace.

11. But (in those former cases) although this surety of the peace be released,
yet the recog. shall not be cancelled by the Justice of peace, for peradventure
the recog. was forfeited before such release was made, and therefore the
Justice of peace shall do best to certify such recog. with the release
together to the next quarter Sessions.

12. The form of the release of the Justice of peace, and the form of the
release of the party you may see postea in the title of Warrants and Presidents.

13. Note that the party that first demanded the peace, may release the same,
either before the same Justice of peace that took the recog. or before any
other Justice of peace.

14. Note also that to release such surety of the peace by deed under his hand
and seal is nothing worth, but it must be by acknowledgement before a Justice
of peace.

15. Note also that the King cannot release or pardon the surety of the peace
nor such recog. taken in the behalf of any of his subjects, until it be
forfeited, for the mischief that may come to the party thereby, but being
forfeited, then the King and none other may release and pardon the forfeiture.

16. But the death or resignation of the King discharges this surety of the
peace taken by his subject, 1. H. 7. 1. Br peace 15. Br. Cor. 21.
for the recog. is to keep the peace of the King then being, and when he is
dead, etc. it is not his Peace.

17. Also the death of the Recognisor ( scil. the party principal that is
bound) discharges this surety of the peace, and the recog. if it were not
forfeited before his death.

18. Also the death of the party, at whose suit the peace was taken,
discharges the recog. if it were to keep the peace against him alone, if it
were not forfeited before his death.

19. But yet in these three former cases, such death should not discharge the
recog. if it were forfeited before, and therefore it shall be best for the
Justice of peace to send to the next Sessions such recog. (notwithstanding such
death) else the King may be defrauded of a forfeiture if any were before.

20. The death of the sureties shall not discharge the recog. neither shall the
party principal be compelled to find new sureties after their death, 21. Ed.
4. 4^. Br. peace 17.
for if the peace be broken after their deaths, their executors shall be
charged therewith, and so there is no mischief by their deaths, if they were
sufficient, but if the sureties were insufficient then the principal shall be
compelled to find new sureties.

21. Ed. 4. 40. 10. H. 7. 11. Br. Recog. 21.
21. If the King and the Recognisor be at issue upon the breach of the peace,
and the King waives the issue, yet is not this recog. discharged but remains
in force, and may be sued again upon a new breach of the peace afterward.

What Act shall be (or makes) a forfeiture of the Recognisance taken for the
peace. CHAP. 60.
1. Whatsoever Act is an express breach of the peace, the same is a
forfeiture of this recognisance.

2. And first this breach of the peace may be committed by using any fearful
or threatening speeches to another, 18. Ed. 4. 28: Br. peace 16.
therefore all menacing or threatening to kill, or beat another, to his face, is
a forfeiture of this recog. otherwise if the party so threatened be absent, and
yet if the party so bound shall threaten to kill or beat A. who is absent, and
after shall lie in wait for him to kill or beat him, this is a forfeiture of
his recognisance.

3. So also to strike at, or offer to strike at a man, although he never hurt
nor hit him, Dalton 160.
is a forfeiture of his Recognisance.

Ibid.
4. Much more all affrayes, or violent or malicious batteries, strikings,
beatings, woundings, or other misintreating of the person of another are
forfeitures of this Recognisance.

5. The difference of these three, viz. menacing, assaulting and beating, Ibid.
are these, viz. menacing begins the breach of the peace, assaulting
increases it, and battery accomplisheth it.

6. If he that is bound do but command or procure another to break the peace,
and that it be indeed done, this is a forfeiture of this Recog. Br. Peace 20.

7. All imprisonment or arresting of another without warrant, is a forfeiture
of this Recognisance.

8. So to thrust another into the water, whereby he is in danger of drowning.

9. So to ravish a woman against her will.

10. So to commit any Burglary, robbery, murder, or manslaughter, all which are
to the person of another, or to procure the same, all, and every of these are
forfeitures of this recog.

11. So to commit any Treason against the person of the King.

Marrow lect. 7. 2. H 7. 2. b.
12. Note that the Act which must make a forfeiture of a recog. for the peace,
must be done or intended to the person of another (by the opinion of Master
Marrow.) And the book 2. H. 7. imports as much, saying, that this surety of
the peace is not broken without an affray, fighting, beating, or the like.

13. Also to be riotously assembled, Marrow.
is a breach of the peace and a forfeiture of this recog. nay if two Justices
of peace shall record a riot upon their view (against a man so bound to the
peace) although it were no riot, etc. yet he cannot plead not guilty in a
scire facias upon his Recognisance.

14. Also to wear armor, or weapons not usually worn, or to go with an
unusual number of attendants, seem also to be a breach or means of a breach
of the peace, and a forfeiture of this recog. for the peace, for these stricke
a fear and terror in the people, and be in effray del pais, See Br. Surety
12.

15. He that is bound to the peace ought to carry himself well in his
behavior and company, yet the having of weapons or company unusual are in
some cases allowed, and lawful, and are no breach of the peace, as in
executing of any legal authority by magistrates or by any other of the Kings
officers or ministers of Justice.

16. Battery Iustificable.
Also though assaults and batteries be for the most part contrary to the peace
of the Realm, and the Laws of the same, yet some are allowed to have a
natural, and some a civil power (or authority, over others) so that they may
(in reasonable and moderate manner only) correct and chastise them for their
offenses without any imputation of breach of the peace, yea they may by the Law
justify the same.

17. And therefore the parent, with moderation may chastise the child within
age.

18. So may the master his servant, or apprentice.

19. So may the schoolmaster his scholars.

20. So may the Jailer, or his servant by his commandment, his unruly
prisoners.

21. So may any man his kinseman that is madd, etc. and none of these shall be
in peril therefore to forfeit any recog. of the peace.

22. And where the servant shall be negligent in his service or shall refuse to
do his work, etc. there the master may chastise his servant for such
negligence or refusal, so as he does not it outragiously.

23. But if the servant shall depart out of his masters service, 38. H. 6. 25.
and the master happen after to lay his hands on him, yet the master in this
case may not beat, 5. El. 4. P. Laborers.
or forceibly compel his said servant against his will to return or tarry
with him, or do his service, but either he must complain to the Justices of
peace, for his servants departure, or he may have an Action upon the statute of
Laborers against his servant if being required to do his service he shall
refuse it, See antea tit. Laborers.

24. And as the Master without the breach of the peace, cannot by beating or
force compel his servant to serve against his will, no more can a Lord, 21.
Ed. 4. 6. li. Intr. b. 13.
or guardian in Chivalry compel his Ward, by beating, or by force to come unto
him or to tarry with him against his will.

25. Also the schoolmaster may chastise his scholar with a rod, which is
careless and negligent of his learning, 22. Ed. 4. 45. 22. Ass. p. 5. 6.
or that shall abuse his schoolefellowes, or for other the like occasions.

26. Also it is lawful for the parents, kinsemen, or other friends of a man
that is madd or frantic (who being at liberty attempteth to burn a house, or
to do some other mischief, or to hurt himself or others) to take and put him
into an house, to bind or chain him, and to beat him with rods, and to do
any forceible Act to reclaim him or to keep him so as he shall do no hurt.

An officer. Li. intr 612. Stam. 13. 14. 21 H. 7. 39.
27. Also if a Constable, Sergeant, Bailiffe, or other officer of Justice, or
any other being of their company, for the better executing of their office,
shall be forced to strike any one that will not yield to their arrest, or that
shall resist, or fly from their arrest, they shall not be in danger to forfeit
any recog. of the peace by any such assault, or striking, but may well justify
such Act.

Li. intr. 611. 16. Ed. 4. 11. 12. Ed. 4. 6.
28. Also it is no breach of the peace, for any private man to beat, strike, or
wound another, in defense or safeguard of his own person from killing,
wounding, or beating, but is a thing justifieable, and yet it seems if
another shall assault me, if I may escape with my life, or without being
wounded, maimed, or hurt, it is not lawful for me to hurt or wound the other,
who first made the assault, but I must first fly, or go from him as far as
I can. 25. Ed. 3. 42. 2. H. 4. 8. 33. H. 6. 18. Br. trans. 28. 71. Cromp. 137.

29. If two or more do agree together to play at Barriers, Backsword,
Bucklers, Football, or the like, and one of them does wound or hurt the other,
the party hurt shall have no Action of Trespass against the other, for that it
was by consent, and to try their valor, and not to break the peace, Fitz.
Bar. 244.

30. Yet if such a man were before bound to the peace, such Act seems to be a
forfeiture of his recog. See Br. Coron. 229. for although such sports be
suffered, yet they are not lawful.

In defense of others.
31. Also it is no breach of the peace for a man to beat him that does assault,
and would beat, wound, or evil entreat his wife, father, mother, master, but
is justifieable.

32. So if the wife shall beat him that assaulteth, and would beat or evil
entreat her husband, this is justifieable.

33. So if the father, or mother, shall beat him that assaulteth, and would
beat or evil entreat their child being then within age and not able to defend
it self.

34. But though the servant may lawfully beat him that does assault, and would
beat, or evil entreat his master or mistrisse, yet the servant cannot
justify the beating of another in defense of the father, mother, brother,
sister, son, or daughter of his master or mistrisse, for he owes no
obedience to any of them.

35. By some opinions the master cannot justify the beating of him that does
assault, and would beat his servant, Pr. 5. f. Justify 3.
but the master with a sword, staff, or other weapon may defend his servant
assaulted from being beaten, in respect of the loss of his service, yet Master
Lambert and Master Crompton are of opinion, that the master may beat another in
defense of his servant, Cromp. 136.
which seems to be the better opinion, by reason of the loss which the
Master shall sustain by the wounding of his servant.

36. Lamb. 131.
But the farmour or tenant cannot justify such an Act in defense of his
landlord, nor a Citizen, etc. in defense of the Mayor, (or Bailiffes) of the
City, or Town corporate where he dwells, unless it be in the legal
execution of their offices.

37. 9. Ed. 4. 28. 19. H. 6. 31. 63. Li. intr. 611. In defense of my goods.
Also the Law does tolerate a man to beat another for the preservation of his
goods, and therefore he that shall attempt by force, and violence, to take away
my goods wrongfully from me, whether they be goods whereof I have a lawful
property, or such goods whereof I have only a possession by the bailement of
another, I may justify to defend the same by force, and if I shall beat or
hurt such person, it is no breach of my recog. for the peace, but if I kill
him, it is felony, and then a breach of the recog.

38. The same Law is in every case, 10. Ed. 4. 6. 3. H. 4. 9. 11. H. 6. 33.
where another shall attempt by force and violence to take away my land,
freehold, copihold, or lease, or to stop and turn my lawful high way, or my
ancient river, or water course leading to my mill, in these and like cases, if
I shall disturb him therein, whereupon he does assault and attempt to beat me,
I may justify to beat him again as well in defense of my person, as of my
possessions, but not to kill him.

39. The same Law is also in every case, where any offendour is by order of Law
punished by whipping, stocks, pillory, or otherwise for any offense by him
committed contrary to the Laws or statutes of this Realm, there is no peace
broken nor any recog. of the peace forfeited, by him or them which shall
lawfully execute any such punishments.

40. Note further that there are diverse offenses for which an indictment
contra pacem, will lie, and yet the committing of such offense shall be no
forfeiture of the recog. for the peace, for that the Act that shall breed a
forfeiture of such a recog. must be done or intended unto the person, as
aforesaid, or in terrorem populi.

41. Therefore to enter into the lands, Dalton 163. and 164.
where he ought to bring his Action or to disseise another of his lands, or to
enter into lands or tenements with force being without offer of violence to any
man's person and without public terror. Cromp. 136. or to do a trespass in
another man's corn or grass, or to take away another man's Ward, to take away
another man's goods wrongfully, so it be not from his person, or to steal
another man's horse, or other goods feloniously being not from his person, these
will make no breach of this recog.

4 H. 7. 8.
42. Note that if a man be bound in such a recog. for himself and his servants,
if any one of them break the peace, the whole recog. is forfeited, Et sic in
similibus.

43. Note also that the sureties may plead, that the party principal has not
broken the peace, although upon issue the same shall be found against the said
principal, for they are estrangers thereto, Fitz. averment 46.

Concerning the writ of supplicavit. CHAP. 61.
1. THe forms of this writ out of the Chancery are of diverse sorts, as you
may see, Fitz. Na. Br. 80. d.

2. By which forms of the writ, it appears, that it may be directed to the
Justices of peace, or to one of them, or to the Sheriff, or to every of them,
to cause the party that is to be bound, to come before him, or them, to find
surety of the peace, and this writ may be that the principal shall be bound in
such a sum, and the sureties in such a sum certain, (and also it may be in
what certain sums the demandant will) or the sums may by the writ be
referred to the Justice of peace, etc. with this clause therein contained, pro
qua respondere volueris, and the said writ is further, that if the party shall
refuse, etc. that they shall commit him to the jail, quousque, etc. and that
when they have taken such surety, they do certify the recog. (which they have
so taken) under their seals, and return the writ into the Court whence the
same was awarded, and that without delay.

3. And for that this writ is of diverse forms, the Justice of peace must have
a care that he do execute the same in every behalf as the same writ shall
direct him.

4. When the writ does refer the sum, wherein the principal and his
sureties shall be bound, to the Justice, etc. then it rests in their
discretion, but yet it is then safe for them to take good sureties, and to bind
them in good sums, and the rather when that clause is in the writ, pro qua
respondere volueris.

21. H. 7. 20. Br. peace 9.
5. When this writ is directed to the Sheriff, and to all the Justices, and is
delivered to any one of them, he only to whom it is first delivered, ought to
execute the same writ (in every behalf) scil. he only shall make a warrant,
etc. returneable before himself, and shall take sureties, and make return
thereof (only) without any other.

6. The form of a warrant for the peace, upon a supplicavit you may see,
postea tit. Warrants and Presidents.

7. Also the same Justice of peace after such surety taken, may make the party
a supersedeas to discharge him from any other arrest, or to deliver him being
in prison, for the peace, (at any other man's suit as it seems) Cromp. 237. b.

8. The form of the supersedeas you may see after tit. of Warrants and
Presidents.

9. The party who is attached upon this writ of supplicavit, 21. H. 7. Br.

cannot go to be bound before any other Justice of peace but only before him,
from whom the warrant proceeds upon this writ, neither can another Justice of
peace by a supersedeas discharge such a warrant made by his fellow Justice by
force of this writ.

10. The Justice, or Sheriff, to whom this writ shall be delivered may make a
Deputy therein, 9. Ed. 4. 35. f. Fx. Imp. 4.
scil. may make a warrant to the Constable, or other person indifferent, to
apprehend the body or cause the party to come before him (the said Justice or
Sheriff) to find sureties, etc. and that if he shall refuse, that then the
Constable, etc. shall carry him to prison, thereto remain until he shall
find sureties, and yet the writ of supplicavit is to commit the party to the
jail if he shall refuse before the Justices (si coram vobis, vel te
recusaverit) but the Justice or Sheriff cannot give their power to another to
take this surety, for that is a judicial power, which cannot be assigned over,
neither can they make any Deputy therein, but they must take this surety
themselves. Br. office 39.

11. If the party shall make resistance upon the execution of this writ, it
seems the officer may take posse comitatus to aid him to arrest such party.

12. F.N.B. 80. d.
He that is to be bound to the peace by force of this writ of supplicavit out
of the Chancery, is to be bound against him only, that sueth out the writ, as
appears by the form of the writ aforesaid.

13. But yet at this day it is used otherwise, Dalton p. 165.
and Master Dalton says that he once received out of the Chancery a special
writ of supplicavit, directed custodibus pacis, ac vic. and eorum cuilibet,
commanding them to take sureties of the peace to be bound, quod ipse damnum vel
malum aliquod alicui de populo nostro and precipue eidem Ioh. etc. (that sued
out the writ) non fac. nec fieri procurabit, etc.

14. Also by this writ of supplicavit the party (against whom the writ is sued
forth) shall be bound to the peace for ever (if he be taken) for the writ
contains or mentions not that he shall be bound to keep the peace until
any certain time but generally (ad sufficientem securitatem inveniend. sub
poena, etc.) and therefore to prevent this the party (before he be attached)
may come into the Chancery, and there find sureties, and be bound until a
certain day that he shall do no hurt unto the party that sued forth the
supplicavit, and thereupon he shall have a supersedeas out of the Chancery
directed to the Justices of peace and to the Sheriff, commanding them to
surcease to arrest the said party, or to compel him to find any sureties,
etc. and that if they have arrested him for this cause, and none other, that
then they deliver him, etc. Fitz. 81. a.

F.N.B. 81. 2. Cromp. 144.
15. And if the party against whom this writ is sued forth cannot travel (or
else will not travel) to bind himself in the Chancery, then he may cause some
of his friends to be bound for him, or to find sureties in the Chancery for
him according to the supplicavit, and thereupon they may purchase for him a
supersedeas directed to the Justices of peace, and to the Sheriff, and by this
supersedeas the Justice and Sheriff shall be commanded to take also surety of
the party himself in the County (according to the writ of supplicavit) that he
shall keep the peace, etc.

16. Also if the party happen to be arrested and imprisoned upon this writ, yet
if he can procure a supersedeas out of the Chancery it seems (by the words in
the end of the supersedeas) that this will discharge him of the arrest, or
imprisonment.

17. Note after the party is arrested and imprisoned, (upon this writ) the
means for him to procure a supersedeas out of the Chancery, must be.

18. Either to get some of his friends to be bound in the Chancery for him and
they to get a supersedeas, ut supra.

19. Or else to get a certificate to the Lord Chancellor, from 3. or 4.
Justices of peace in his behalf.

20. This writ of supplicavit is granted, or to be granted in the Chancery or
Kings Bench, F.N.B. 79. h.
upon great cause showed and proved there, and is (or ought) to be granted upon
oath, that the party is in fear, etc. of some bodily hurt, etc.

Co. 8. 37.
21. And it is to be wished, that in the granting thereof, great care be taken,
for oftentimes this writ of supplicavit is procured and gotten out rather of
malice and for vexation, then upon any needful and just cause, and Sir Edward
Coke speaking of such as maliciously shall purchase out any such special
supplicavit or latitat of the peace, (and that by fraud and malice to enforce
the other party ad redemendam vexationem, to give them money or to yield the
other composition) brandeth them as Barreters, and notable oppressors of their
neighbors, oppressing the poor and innocent, by color and countenance of
Law, which was ordained to protect the innocent from all oppression and wrong,
neither is this a wrong only to the party thus maliciously vexed, but also to
all the Justices of peace resident in that County, taxing them (tacit) as
though the demandant could not have Justice at their hands in such a case,
whereas perhaps the demandant never demanded the same at any of their hands,
and besides the Justices of peace having, in all likelihood, knowledge of each
party and of their behaviors, or any one of them, might and would no doubt,
yea and ought to have yielded the demandant upon request and just cause showed
to them, as sufficient and good surety in the Country every way, See more
before in this title.
(as I conceive it) for his safety, as namely, as many and able sureties, and
better known, and to have been bound in as great sums, and for as long
time, if the case should require, so as what should move them to seek (with
more trouble, charge, and delay to themselves) that security above, which they
may have (more speedily, and with less charge and trouble) at home, I see not
but only, or chiefly the vexing and oppressing of their neighbors aforesaid,
and for that this manner of oppressing begins to grow over common; therefore
I thought it not amiss here to observe what remedy the Justices of peace in
the Country by some opinions, may by their discretion yield to their innocent
neighbors, against whom for vexation only, such a writ shall be maliciously
procured, scilicet.

22. Where one has procured a supplicavit out of the Chancery or Kings Bench
against another, if he has not before demanded this surety of the peace at the
hands of some Justice of peace in the Country, or that the party against whom
he has procured the supplicavit, be one of such condition and sort as that in
likelihood the Justices of peace in the Country, will not deny to grant such
surety against him, then if three or four of the next Justices of peace in the
Countrry, shall certify to the Lord Chancellor (if the supplicavit proceeded
out of the Chancery) that the party plainetiffe never demanded the peace in the
Country, and further that the plainetiffe is a contentious man, and the other
party of good fame, upon such certificate (as is said) they will discharge the
party or grant a supersedeas.

23. Note to conclude this business, if the surety of the peace be taken by
virtue of a supplicavit, then must the Justice of peace make return of the
writ, and certificate of his doings under his seal into the Court from whence
the supplicavit did proceed, which may be done in this manner.

24. First let him write upon the back of the supplicavit thus.

25. Executio istius brevis, The return of the supp.
patet in quadam scedula huic brevi annexat.

26. Then may the certificate The certificate.
or scedule be thus, and be filed to the back of the writ.

27. Ego I. S. Miles unus custodum pacis domini Regis in comitatu Dublin
certifico in Cancellarium dicti domini regis me virtute istius brevis (mihi per
A. B. in eodem brevi nominatum, primo deliberat) personaliter coram me (tali
die and loco) venire fecisse. F. R. in dicto brevi nominatum, ac eundem F.
adsufficientem securitatem, and manucaptores pacis inveniendum secundum formam
dicti brevis, viz, etc. (as the writ shall appoint) compulisse, In cujus rei
testimonium huic praesenti certificationi meae sigillum meum apposui, datum
apud D. praedictum, in comitatu praedicto 16. die Ianuarij anno Regni domini
nostri Caroli dei gratia regis, etc.

28. The return of the Certiorari.
The Justice of peace may also therewith send the recog. if he will, or may
keep and stay the recog. until a Certiorari come to him for it.

29. And of the Recognisance.
And if a Certiorari be directed out of the Chancery to the Justice of peace
for removing of this recog. because it was not sent up together with the
certificate (as there was no necessity that it should) then that writ may be
also answered in this manner, videlicet.

30. Write upon the back of the Certiorari thus, Virtute istius brevis ego I.
S. Miles unus custodum pacis domini regis in Commit. Dublin tenorem securitatis
pa^is, Lib. intr. 453^
unde infra fit mentio dicto domino Regi in Cancellar. suam sub Sigillo meo
distinct and aperte mitto, prout patet in scedula huic brevi consuta.

31. And then write the recog. verbatim, in this manner hereunder following,
The s^hedule or certificate.
and thereto set your seal.

32. Memorandum quod 16. die Ianuarij, etc. (reciting the whole recog. to the
end) In cujus rei testimonium ego praedictus I. S. sigillum meum apposui datum,
etc.

33. And file this scedule, or note of the recog. to the back of the
Certiorari.

34. The form of the Certiorari you may see, Fitz. Na. Br. 81. c. vide postea
tit. Warrants and Presidents.

F.N.B. 81. c.
35. Also the like form of the certificate may serve where a Certiorari is
brought to a Justice of peace to remove a recog. of the peace taken by him ex
officio, without any writ of supplicavit.

36. And if the Justice of peace shall not return the supplicavit, nor
certificate of his doings therein, F.N.B. 81. b.
until a Certiorari come to him for it, it is no danger to him.

37. Also if the supplicavit be against diverse, and the demandant will release
his prayer of the peace against one of them, then that release ought to be
certified for him, and the writ must be served and executed for the rest, or
else non est inventus, may be certified for him, and the writ executed for the
rest.

Br. peace 11.
38. By the book in 30. Assisarum placito 14. It appears that a man may be
compelled to find sureties both for the good behavior, 2. H. 7. 2. b.
and for the peace, and yet it seems that the good behavior includes the
peace and that he that is bound to the good behavior, is therein also bound to
the peace, see the usual forms of both recog.

Surety for the good behavior. CHAP. 62.
1. THis surety for the good behavior, or good abearing is granted by the
Justice of peace as well by authority of the Commission of the peace, P. Justice
18.
that is to say, by the first Assign. as also by force of the statute of 34.
Ed. 3. ca. 1.

2. And this surety for the good behavior is of great affinity with that of
the peace, and is provided and ordained chiefly for the preservation of the
peace (as that other is) as you may observe out of the usual forms of the
recog. yea by some opinions it differs in little or nothing from that of the
peace, but that there is more difficulty in the performance thereof, and the
party so bound, may sooner fall into the danger of it then of his recog. for
the peace, P.R. 18. 2. H. 7. 2.
for say they the recognisance for the peace is not broken without an affray
committed, battery, assaulting, imprisoning or extremity of menacing, whereas
the good abearing may be broken, and the parties recog. forfeited, without any
of these, as namely.

3. By the extraordinary number of the people attending upon the party bound.

4. Or by his wearing of harness, or other weapons, more then usually he has
done, or more then be meet for his degree.

5. P.R. 22.
Or by using words or threatenings tending or inciting to the breach of the
peace.

6. Or by doing any other thing which shall tend to the breach of the peace, or
to put the people in dread or fear, although there be no actual breach of the
peace.

7. Yet note these four last matters, as they are breaches of the good
abearing, so are they causes also to bind a man to the peace, and a forfeiture
of the recog. for the peace.

8. The book 2. H. 7. fo. 2. concludes, that the Just. were not all
certainly advised how those words, de se been gerendo, should be taken, M.
Bro. abridging thereof tit. Surety 12. says, that it was holden that he who
is bound to the peace ought to demean himself well in his part ( sc.
behavior) and company, and not doing any thing that may be the cause of the
breach of the peace, or to put the people in fear or trouble, yet the book
seems to mean this of the good behavior.

9. But though this extraordinary number of attendants, and wearing of
harness, etc. are breaches as well of the peace as of the good behavior, yet
it may seem that this for the good behavior, does include the peace, and
besides imports some greater or other matters of misbehaviour, and for which
the surety of the peace is not to be granted (although they also are against
the peace, and quiet and good government of the land) and you shall find that
this surety of the good behavior is grantable in other diverse cases, in which
the surety of the peace is not grantable.

10. This surety of the good behavior is to be granted at the suit of diverse,
and those being men of credit, and to provide for the safety of many, whereas
the surety of the peace is usually granted at the request of one, and for the
preservation of the peace chiefly toward one.

11. Also this surety of good abearing, is most commonly granted, either in
open Sessions of the peace, or out of the Sessions, by two or three Justices of
peace, whereas that of the peace is usually granted by one Justice of peace,
and out of Sessions.

12. And yet by the words of the Commission, 14. H. 7. 8. ^.
as also by the opinion of the learned, any one Justice of peace alone, and out
of the Sessions, may grant this surety of the good abearing, and that either by
his own discretion, or upon the complaint of others, as they may that of the
peace.

13. But this is not usual, unless it be to prevent some great and sudden
danger, especially against a man that is of any good estate, carriage or report.

14. Also this surety may be granted at the suit of one person.

15. But the more difficult and dangerous this surety is to the party bound,
the more regard there ought to be taken in the granting of it, and therefore it
shall be good discretion in the Justices of peace, that they do not command or
grant it, but either upon sufficient cause seen to themselves, or upon the
suit and complaint of diverse others, as aforesaid, and the same very honest
and credible persons.

16. Also this surety of good abearing, is often taken by the Justice of peace
by virtue of a special writ in nature of a supplicavit, Supplicavit.
directed out of the Chancery or Kings Bench, and then the Justice of peace
upon such a writ, is to proceed as a minister, as in case for the P. mutatis
mutandis, vide ante tit. Surety for the peace and supplicavit.

17. Master Dalton affirms that he once received out of the Chancery, Dalton
p. 170.
such a writ directed custodibus pacis in commit. Cantabrigiae, ac vicecomiti
ejusdem commit. and eorum cuilibet (and grounded upon the statute of 34. Ed. 3.)
commanding them and every of them to take four sureties (besides the party)
whereof every one of them should have lands of such a yearly value, or goods
of such a value, and to bind the sureties every of them in such a sum, quod
ipse boni gestus de cetero erit, erga nos and cunctum populum nostrum, and quod
nihil in contrarium statuti pradicti attemptabit, etc. and therein he proceeded
as a minister only.

18. The party against whom such a supplicavit for the good behavior shall be
granted out, before he be attached thereupon, may go, or send up, and give
sureties in the Chancery as here before is said for the peace, and thereupon he
shall have a supersedeas out of that Court directed to the Justices of peace,
and Sheriff, and to every of them, commanding every of them to surcease to
arrest the said party, or to do any other execution of the said writ of
supplicavit and that if (before the coming of the said supersedeas) they have
taken any such security, for the good behavior of the party, that then they
presently release the party of such surety found by him, the former writ of
supplicavit notwithstanding.

For what cause this surety of the good behavior shall be granted. CHAP. 63.
1. IT is chiefly to be granted (by the Justices of peace out of their
Sessions) in these cases following, viz. against common Barretors, common
Quarrellers, and common breakers or perturbers of the peace.

2. Also it is grantable against Rioters, see hereof before tit. Riots.

3. Also against such as shall lie in wait to rob, or shall be suspected to lie
in wait to rob, or shall assault, P. Justice 18.
or attempt to rob another, or shall put passengers by the way in fear or
peril.

4. Also against such, as be generally feared, or suspected to be Robbers by
the high way.

5. Also against such as are like to commit murder, homicide, Cromp. 135. b.
or other grievances to any of the Kings subjects in their bodies.

6. Also against such as shall practice to poison another.

7. One had bought Ratsbane, and mingled the same with corn, and then wilfully
did cast the same amongst his neighbors poultry, Dalton p. 171.
whereby most of them dyed, and this was holden to be a good cause to bind the
offender to the good behavior.

8. P. Justice 18. 34. Ed. 3. ca. 1.
It is also grantable against such as be of evil name and fame generally, but
more especially against all such as are defamed and detected in any of these
partitulars following.

9. 13. H. 7. 10.
First against all those that are greatly defamed for resorting to houses
suspected to maintain adultery, or incontinence.

10. Also against the maintainers of houses commonly suspected to be houses of
common Bawdrie.

11. Cromp. 140.
One that had such lewd women found in his house was bound to his good
behavior, by Wray, Anderson, and Manwood. 28. El.

12. Also against common whoremongers, and common whores, 1. H. 7. 7. 27. H. 8.
14.
for by good opinion Avowtry, or Bawdry, is an offense temporal as well as
spiritual, and is against the peace of the land.

13. Upon information given to a Constable, 13. H. 10 Br. Traverse 432.
that a man and a woman be in adultery, or fornication together (or that a man
and a woman of an evil report, are gone to a suspected house together in the
night) the officer may take company with him, and if he find them so, he may
carry them to prison, or he may carry them before a Justice of peace to find
sureties for the good behavior.

14. Also against night-walkers, that be suspected to be pilferers, or
otherwise like to disturb the peace, or that be persons of evil behavior, or
of evil fame or report generally, or that shall keep company with any such, or
with any other suspicious persons in the night. 13. H. 7. 10.

15. Against such as be Evesdroppers, that is to say, that in the night shall
harken near the walls of men's houses to hear what is spoken within, and to
make use thereof to breed discord or dissension amongst neighbors.

16. Against Night-walkers that shall cast men's gates or Carts into ponds, etc.
or shall commit other misdemeanors or outrages in the night time.

17. Against suspected persons who live idly, and yet fare well, or are well
apparelled, having nothing whereon to live, (except upon examination, they
shall give account of such their living.)

18. Against common Haunters of Alehouses or Tavernes, but more specially if
they have not whereon to live, and also against common Drunkards and Prophaners
of the Sabbath, and against common Gamesters and Keepers of common gaming
houses whereby men's servants and children are drawn to Unthriftinesse, and
also against Alehouse-keepers and Inne-keepers that maintain misorder in their
houses, and especially on the Sabbath day.

19. Against such as shall use to go in the message of Thieves, See stat. 18.
Ed. 2. P. Leete 1.

20. All these former offenders, and the like, are evil members in the common
wealth, and such their demeanor and living is greatly to be suspected (and
besides do seem to be more properly said against the peace of the land, then
Avowtrey, in the case before. 1. H. 7. 7.) and therefore it seems reasonable,
just, and expedient that the Justices of peace upon their discretion should
convent such persons before them and their courses of life, and if they cannot
yield a good reason and account of such their courses, then to bind them to
their good behavior.

21. Also the good behavior seems grantable against such as shall make false
outcries, or shall raise Huy and Cries without cause, for these are
disturbances of the peace. Cromp. 179.

22. If two men do levy Huy and Cry one upon another without cause, both of
them may be attached and bound over, as disturbers of the peace. P. R. 156.

23. Also Cheators and Cozoners may be bound to the good behavior.

See Co. 5. 125. P. R. 12.
24. Libellers, it seems, may also be bound to their good behavior as
disturbers of the peace, whether they be the contrivers, the procurers or the
publishers of the libell, for such libelling and defamation tends to the
raising of quarrels, and effusion of blood, and are specially occasions and
means tending and inciting greatly to the breach of the peace.

25. Also it seems grantable against unlawful hunters in parks, after their
examination taken, vide antea tit. Hunting.

26. Also it shall be granted against him that shall abuse a Justice of peace
(Constable or other officer of the peace) in executing of their office.

9. El. 43.
27. A Justice of peace sees a man break the peace ( sc. to make an assault,
or affray upon A.) and he charge him to keep the peace, and the other
answers that he will not, the Justice of peace may bind him to the good
behavior.

See Exodus 22.28
28. For (if as one says) contempt, or contumely, used to the person of a man's
better, neither policy for example nor religion for peace may tolerate, much
less to use contempt toward, or to abuse such as are in authority, especially
when they are in executing their office.

29. Nay it seems that he which shall use words of contempt, or contra bonos
mores, against a Justice of peace, though it be not at such time as he is
executing his office, yet he shall be bound to his good behavior.

30. If a Citizen or free man of a City, Co. 11. 98.
or Town corporate shall use words of contempt, or contra bonos mores, against
the chief officer of the City, or Town, or his brethren, they are good causes
to commit him to prison until he shall find sureties for his good behavior,
for obedience and reverence ought to be yielded to the magistrate, for that
they derive their authority from the King.

31. Also he that shall abuse a Justice of peace his warrant may be bound to
his good behavior.

32. A man complains of a Riot or a forceible Entry, so that the Justices of
peace are assembled to enquire thereof, and then the party that complained will
not prosecute the matter, it seems the said Justices of peace may bind him to
his good behavior, for his deluding them.

33. And so of such as shall charge another with felony, before a Just. of
Peace, and yet will not give Evidence, etc.

34. A. is bound to keep the peace against B. only, Cromp. 134.
and gets a supersedeas, and after B. releaseth him, after A. is arrested
for surety for the peace at another man's suit, and shows this first
supersedeas, it seems he shall be bound to his good behavior for this deceit.

35. He that has a pardon for any felony, 10. Ed 3. P. pardon 5.
shall find surety for his good behavior, but he shall be bound before the
Sheriff and Coroners, who shall return the same into the Chancerie.

36. Also he that is acquitted of felony, if he be of evil fame, or of evil
behavior, it seems the Justices of peace upon their discretion may bind him
to his good behavior.

37. The form of a warrant for the good behavior, vide postea tit. Warrants.

38. The form of the Recog. for the good behavior, vide postea tit.
Recognisance.

39. Whether the surety of the good behavior (taken upon complaint) may be
released by any special person, some do doubt it, Release. Lamb. 126.
because it seems more popular, then the surety of the peace, yet others do
hold that it may be released either by the Justice of peace himself that took
it in discretion, P.R. 2^.
or by the party upon whose complaint it was granted, even as that for the
peace may.

40. It seems also a Supersedeas Supersedeas.
of the good behavior may be granted by the Justices of peace (as well as for
the peace mutatis mutandis) upon good sureties taken by the said Justices of
the party to be of the good behavior. Cromp. 237.


41. Cromp. 146.
If a man be bound to the good behavior (before Justices of peace) and to
appear at the next Assizes or Sessions, yet the party bound may by a
Certiorari Certiorari.
remove the Recognisance (into the Chancerie, or Kings Bench) before the day,
and then he shall not need to appear at the Assizes, or Sessions, for they
have no record; whereupon he may be called there.

Swearing and Cursing. CHAP. 64.
1. FOrasmuch as all profane swearing and cursing is forbidden by the Word of
God, 10. Caroli ca. 1. in Ireland.
it is enacted by Parliament in anno 10. Caroli ca. 1. that no person or
persons shall profanely swear or curse, and that every person or persons that
shall at any time or times offend herein either in the hearing of a Justice of
peace, bailiffe, or any other head officer of any City or Town corporate,
where such offense is or shall be committed, or shall be thereof convicted by
the oaths of two witnesses, or by confession of the party, before any Justice
of Peace of the County, or head officer or Justice of Peace in the City or
town corporate, where such offense is or shall be committed, to which end
every Justice of peace, and every such head officer, have power by that Act to
minister the same oath, that then every such offendour shall, for every time so
offending, forfeit and pay to the use of the poor of that parish, where the
same offense is or shall be committed, the sum of Twelve pence, and it shall
also be lawful for the Constables and Churchwardens, or any one of them, by
warrant from such Justice of peace or head officer, to levy the same sum or
sums of money, by distress and sale of the offenders goods, rendering to the
party the overplus, and in defect of such distress, the offender, if he or she
be above the age of Twelve years, shall, by warrant from such Justice of
Peace, or head officer, be set in the stocks for three whole hours, but if the
offender be under the age of Twelve years, and shall not forthwith pay the said
sum of 12. d. then he or she by the warrant of such Justice of P. or head
officer, shall be whipped by the Constable, or parents or master in his
presence. And be it further enacted that if any such offender shall commence
any suite in Law against any officer or other, for such distraining sale of
goods, whipping or setting in the stocks, the defendant or defendants may
plead the general issue, and give the special matter in evidence to the Jury
at the trial, and if it be found against the plaintiff, or that the
plaintiff be non-suite, the defendant or defendants shall be allowed good
costs, to be taxed by the Court, provided nevertheless, that every offense
against this law, shall be complained of, and proved as abovesaid, within
twenty days after the offense committed.

And it is also enacted that the said Act shall be read in every parish Church,
by the minister thereof upon Sunday after the Evening Prayer twice in the year.

Treason. CHAP. 65.
BEfore the making of the statute of 25. Ed. 3. ca. 2. de prodicionibus, there
was great ambiguity and diversity of opinions what offense should be adjudged
Treason, for clearing whereof the said statute was made, whereby it is declared
that these offenses following should be adjudged Treason, viz.

1. To compass or Imagine the death or destruction of the King, the Queen or
the Prince.

2. To deflowre the Queen or the eldest daughter of the King not married, or
the wife of the eldest son and heir of the King.

3. To levy war against the King in his Realm or to be adherent to the
Kings enemies in his Realm giving them aid or comfort in his Realm or
elsewhere.

4. To counterfeite the Kings great seal or privy seal, or his money.

5. To bring false money into this kingdom like to the Kings money (knowing
the same to be false) to merchandise or make payment in deceit of the King and
his people.

6. To kill the Cancellor, Treasurer or Justices of the King of the one Bench
or the other, Justices in Eire and of the Assizes, and all other Justices of
Oyer and Terminer being in their places doing their offices.

2. All these offenses are by the said statute declared to be Treasons which
extend to the King and his Royal Majesty, for which the King shall have the
Escheate as well of the lands holden of others as of himself.

3. Also there be other offenses by the said statute declared to be petty
Treasons which do not extend to the Kings Majesty, as where the wife does
murder her husband, the servant his master, or the Clerk his Ordinary, in
which cases the chief Lords had the Escheates, but now by a statute made in
this kingdom of Ireland, in 10. H. 7. ca. 21. as well these offenses of petty
Treason as also those which at the common Law were murder of malice prepensed
are made high Treason, both in the Actors and procurers, and by a statute made
in 28. H. 8. ca. 7. in Ireland, all escheats for any manner of Treason are
given to the King.

4. By another statute made in 3. H. 5. ca. 6. It is declared that washing,
fyling or clipping of money shall be high Treason.

5. By another statute made in 4. H. 7. ca. 16. the coining of foreign coin
which is permitted to pass in this Realm is Treason.

6. By another statute made in Ireland in anno 13. H. 8. ca. 1. wilful
burning of houses or Rickes of Corn in the field or in the Towns is made
Treason.

7. By another statute made in Ireland in 11. Eliz. ca. 1. for the attainder of
Shane o Neale the assuming of the name or dignity of O Neale, or taking any
thing by color of that name, is made Treason.

8. By a statute enacted in anno 10. H. 6. ca. 3. in Ireland, for Cessing of
horsemen or footmen upon the Kings subjects, without their good wills, the
offender shall be adjudged as a traitor.

9. By another statute made in Ireland in anno 18. H. 6. ca. 2. It is enacted
that putting into Comricke, and the granting of such Comricke or safeguard
shall be Treason as well in the giver as in the taker.

10. By another statute made in Ireland in anno 10. H. 7. ca. 13. It is enacted
that to cause assembly or insurrection, conspiracies, or in any wise to procure
or stir Irishry or Englishry to make war against the Kings authority, that
is to say, his Lieutenant or Deputy, or Justices, or else in any manner to
procure or stir the Irishry to make war upon the Englishry shall be high
Treason.

11. By another statute in Ireland made in 28. H. 8. ca. 7. It was enacted
amongst other things that if any person shall maliciously wish, will or desire
by words or writing, or by craft imagine, inve^t, practice or attempt any
bodily harm to be done to the King, the Queen or their heirs apparent, or to
deprive them or any of them of the dignity, title, or name of their Royal
estates, or publish or pronounce by express writing or words that the Kings
Majesty is an Heretic, Schismaticke, Tyrant, Infidel, or Usurper of the
Crown, or shall rebelliously detain or withhould from the King, his heirs or
successors any of his or their ships, ordinances, artillery, and other munition
of war, and shall not deliver up the same within six days after they shall
be required by Proclamation under the great seal, the offenders, Ayders,
Counselors, Consenters, and Abettors, shall be adjudged Traitors of high
Treason.

12. Having now briefly declared the statutes which are of force in this
kingdom of Ireland concerning Treasons, I will return back to the exposition
of the said statute of 25. Ed. 3. de prodicionibus.

13. That statute of 25. Ed. 3. does not make any offense to be Treason which
was not Treason by the common Law before, neither does it alter any offense of
Treason at the common Law into a lesser offense, but only declares the common
Law in some particular cases, and therefore it will be necessary to set forth
what offenses have been adjudged to be Treason at the common Law, both before
and sithence the making of that statute.

14. Treasons at the common Law I find thus defined by Glanvill li. 14. ca. 1.
cum quis itaque de morte Regis vel seditione Regni vel exercitus infamatur,
etc. And afterward in the same chapter are these words, viz. ipsum accusatum
machinatum fuisse, vel aliquid fecisse, in mortem Regis vel seditionem Regni
vel exercitus, vel consensisse, vel consilium dedisse, vel authoritatem
prestitisse, etc.

15. Also I find in Bracton li. 2. Titulo de crimine lesae majestatis, Treason
to be thus defined, videlicet: Si quis ausu temerario machinatus sit, in mortem
Regis aut aliquid egerit vel agi procuraverit ad seditionem Dom. Regis vel
exercitus sui, vel procurantibus auxilium; and consilium, prestiterit, aut
consensum, licet id quod in voluntate habuit non produxerit ad effectum.
Tenetur tamen crimine laesae majestatis.

16. Also Britton fo. 16. says that it is high Treason to compass the death
of the King or to disinherit him of his Realm or to falsify his seal or to
counterfeite or clip his money. And in this Bracton in the said title de
crimine laesae majestatis agrees with Britton, and these writers were all
before the statute de 25. Ed. 3. de prodicionibus.

17. If this compassing of the death of the King, etc. may appear either by
words, writing or by any other means, it suffices to make it Treason as
appears by the book in 29. H. 6. fo. 47. and Stamford fo. 2.

18. The words of the statute of 25. Ed. 3. de prodicionibus, makes not any
mention of the consenters and ayders to the counterfeiting of the great seal
or privy seal or of the Kings money, yet this is high Treason by Stamford fo.
3. and 19. H. 6. fo. 47. and the book in 3. H. 7. fo. 9. is not to the
contrary if it be well observed, for there the Indictment wants the word
proditorie, and this is by the rule of the common Law.

19. Also the taking of wax imprinted with the great seal and fixing of that
to a counterfeite or forged writing made in the name of the King is high
Treason, and yet it is not within the words of the statute de prodicionibus,
and so it is adjudged in 2. H. 4. fo. 32. and Stamford fo. 3. says it has
been so adjudged in his time and with him agrees Britton fo. 10. so as this
appears to be Treason at the common Law.

20. Likewise if a man counterfeite the Kings money, although he do not utter
it, yet that is high treason by Stamford fo. 3. 6. H. 7. fo. 13. and 1. R. 3.
fo. 1. but if false money be made within this kingdom and another knowing it
to be false utter it in payment, this is not Treason by Stamford fo 3. but it
is misprision.

21. If many conspire to commit Treason as in levying of war and any one of
them does it, this is treason in all by the common law. Dyer fo. 98. pl. 56.

22. If the servant kill the master by the procurement of the wife, this before
the statute of 10. H. 7. whereby all killing of malice prepensed is made high
treason was pettit Treason in both, but now in Ireland by the said statute it
is high treason in both, and so it is if the husband had been killed by a
stranger by the procurement of the wife. 16. El. Dyer fo. 332. pl. 25.

23. To conspire with the Prince or governor of another Realm to invade any of
the Kings dominions is treason, although there be no such Invasion offered or
openly attempted. 13. El. Dyer fo. 298. pl. 29.

24. To compass or imagine the death of the King, although he were an usurper
is Treason. 9. Ed. 4. fo. 12.

25. One outlawed for felony was in prison where traitors were, he broke the
prison, whereby the traitors escaped, this was adjudged Treason. 1. H. 6. fo.
6.

26. These words to compass or Imagine the death or destruction of the King
are words of large extent, for he that by words or otherwise devises or
advises any means how the King may come to his death, that is Treason,
although it take no effect, also to intend to deprive the King, by that
intention the death of the King is intended, and so the same is Treason by the
declaration of the said statute, and also the detaining of a Castle or
Fortress or such like is levying of war against the King, Br. Treason 24.

27. To run into Rebellion and stand upon their keeping and to rob and spoil
the Kings subjects has always been adjudged to be high Treason in Ireland,
and to be a levying of war against the King.

28. Also to kill the Kings messenger or any that is coming to aid the King
against his enemies is Treason.

29. To set at large unlawfully any that is committed for Treason is Treason by
the common Law, Dalton fo. 225.

30. It is to be observed that in high Treason, there be no accessaries as in
felony, but as well all procurers or abettors before the Treason committed as
releivers of the traitors after the Treason committed, knowing the same, are
principal traitors and not accessaries.

Trespass. CHAP. 66.
10. Caroli c. 23. in hibernia.
1. BY a statute made in Ireland in 10. Caroli ca. 23. all and every lewd person
which shall unlawfully cut, or take away any corn growing, or rob any Orchards
or Gardens, or break or cut any hedge, pale, rail, or fence, or dig, pull
up, or take away any fruit trees, in any Orchard or garden or elsewhere to the
intent to take or carry the same away, or shall bark any trees that are
growing or shall cut or spoil any woods or underwoods, pailes or trees
standing not being felony, and their procurers or receivers knowing the same
being thereof convict, by confession of the party, or by the testimony of one
sufficient witness upon oath before any one Justice of peace (where the
offense shall be committed, or the offender apprehended) shall for the first
fault give the party wronged such recompense, and within such time as by any
one Justice of peace (of the County where such offense was done) shall be
appointed, and if such offender shall be thought (in the discretion of the said
Justice) not able or do not make satisfaction accordingly, then the said
Justice shall commit the said offender to some Constable or other inferior
officer where the offense shall be committed, or the offendour apprehended to
be whipped.

2. Also for the second fault, and every other offense whereof such offendour
shall be after convicted in form aforesaid, such offendour shall be whipped as
aforesaid, ibid.

3. If any Constable or inferior officer do refuse, or do not at the
commandment of a Justice of peace, by himself or by some one by him to be
appointed, execute upon the offender the punishment aforesaid, the said Justice
of peace may commit the said Constable, etc. to the common jail, there to
remain without bail, until the said offender be, by the said Constable or by
some other, by his procurement, whipped as aforesaid.

4. But no Justice of peace shall execute this statute for any of the offenses
aforesaid done unto himself, unless he be assotiated or assisted with one or
more other Justices of peace whom the offense does not concern.

Tyles. CHAP. 67.
1. BY a statute made in anno 17. Ed. 4. it is enacted that all and every
person or persons that shall use the occupation of making of any Roof tyle,
Crest tyle, common tyle or gutter tyle shall make it good, seasonable,
sufficient and thoroughly whited and anealed, and that the ground whereof any

and besides that shall make fine and ransom to the King, at his will, and
that every person that feels himself grieved, and will sue in this behalf
shall have an action of debt against the offenders, wherein shall be made and
had like process, recovery and execution, as is or may be in any other action
of debt pursued at the common Law, and that the plaintiff in every such action
(if it be found with him) shall recover against the defendant in the same

mainprise until he find sufficient sureties before the said Justices by
Recognisance or otherwise to the King, to perform the said definitive sentence
and Judgment as appears by a statute made in Ireland, in Anno 33. H. 8. ca.
12.

Watch. CHAP. 69.
1. EVery Justice of peace may cause night watch to be duly kept for the
arresting of persons suspected, and night-walkers be they strangers or others
that be of evil fame or behavior, and this they may do by force of the first
Assignavimus of the Commission, and of the statute of Winchester, and by the
said statute this Watch is to be kept yearly from the Feast of the Ascension
until Michaelmas in every Town, and shall continue all the night (scil.) from
the Sunsetting to the Sunrising, and by another statute made in anno 5. E. 4.
ca. 5. in Ireland, the Watch is to be kept in every Town from Michaelmas
until Easter: so as by both these statutes watch is to be kept all the year
saving only between Easter and Ascension day.

2. All such strangers or persons suspected as shall in the night time pass by
the watchmen (appointed thereto by the town Constable or other officer) may
be examined by the said watchmen whence they come, and what they be, and of
their business, Winch. 13. Ed. 1. ca. 4. 5. Ed. 3. ca. 14.
etc. and if they find cause of suspicion, they shall stay them, and if such
persons will not obey the arrest of the watchmen, the said watchmen shall levy
Huy and Cry, that the offenders may be taken, or else they may justify to
beat them, for that they resist the peace, and Justice of the realm, and may
also set them in the stocks for the same until the morning, and then if no
suspicion be found the said persons shall be let go and quit, but if they
find cause of suspicion, they shall forthwith deliver the said persons to the
Sheriff, who shall keep them in prison, until they be duly delivered, or
else the watchmen may deliver such persons to the Constable, and so to convey
them to the Justice of peace by him to be examined, and to be bound over or
committed until the offenders be acquitted in due manner.

Wax. CHAP. 70.
11. H. 6. ca. 12.
1. EVery Justice of peace may examine and search (by his discretion) such as
do sell or set forth to be sold any Candles or other works of Wax at higher
price then after the rate of iiij.d. the pound over the common price of plain
wax, between Merchant and Merchant, and may punish them by forfeiture of the
work or value thereof, and by fine to the King.

Weights and Measures. CHAP. 71.
1. BY a statute made in England in anno 9. H. 5. ca. 8. the Justices of peace
have power to take and imprison all falsifiers and Counterfeiters of false
weights, and to hold them in prison without mainprise until they be acquitted
or attainted, and if they be attainted their bodies shall abide in prison
until they have made fynes and Ransomes at the discretion of the said Justices.

2. By another statute made in England in anno 34. E. 3. ca. 6. Justices of
peace have power to enquire of weights and measures, and to punish the
offenders, and therefore it is necessary for them to know what weights and
measures by the laws and statutes of force in this Kingdom, ought to be
observed.

9. H. 3. 26. Weig^^.
3. By the statute of Magna charta, capitulo 26. there shall be but one weight,
one measure, and one yard throughout the whole realm, scil. according to the
Kings Standard in the Exchequer, and this statute of Magna charta has since
herein been confirmed by many several Parliaments, viz. by the statutes of 14.
Ed. 3. ca. 12. 27. Ed. 3. 10. 13. R. 2. 9. 8. H. 6. 5. and 7. H. 7. ca. 3. as
thereby appears.

4. And yet notwithstanding all these statutes, there always has been two
kinds of Weights used in England and both warrantable, the one by law and the
other by Custom (as it seems) but they are for several sorts of wares or
commodities, for there is Troy weights and Averdepois.

Dalton fo. 123.
5. Troy weight is by Law, and thereby are weighed gold, silver, pearl,
precious stones, electuaries, bread, wheat, and all manner of grain or Corn
is measured by Troy weight, and this has to the pound 12. ounces or twenty
shillings old ster. weight, which is three pound of the money now current.

6. Averdepois weight is by Custom, yet confirmed also by statute, and thereby
are weighed all grossery wares, physical drugges, 27. Ed. 3. ca. 10.
Butter, Cheese, flesh, wax, pitch, Tallow, Woolls, Hemp, Flax, Iron,
Steel, Lead, and all other commodities not before named, but especially every
thing that bears the name of Garbell, and whereof issues a refuse or waste.

7. And this has to the pound sixteen Ounces or 25. s. old sterling weight.
Also in this Averdepois weight unto every hundred is allowed twelve pounds
weight.

27. Ed. 3. 10.
8. Also all manner of Averdepois shall be weighed by lawful weights sealed
according to the Standerd of the Eschequer.

Averdepois.
Averdepois weight. 14. ounces and an half, and 2. pence weight Troy do make
16. ounces of Averdepois. 7. pounds, or pints
Averdepois make the Gallon of Wheat, etc. 14. pounds, or pints,
Averdepois make the Pecke of Wheat, etc. 56. pounds, or pints
Averdepois make the Bushel of Wheat, etc.

Pints or pounds. 5120 512 256 64 16 8 4 Troy weight. Quarts. 2560 256 128 32 8

See for Corn, Beer, and Ale, more fully in that which follows.

Troy Weight, 15. H. 3. 32. Wheat Corns taken in the midst of the Ear,
weighs 1.d. sterling. Twenty pence old sterling make the ounce Troy. 12.
Ounces make in weight j. li. Troy. measure j. pint.
Two pints or pounds make the quart. Two quarts make the Pottle. 8. pints make
the Gallon. 4. quarts make the Gallon. 2. Pottles make the Gallon. Eight quarts
make the Pecke. 64. pints 32. quarts 8. gallons 4. peckes make the Bushel or
Firkin.

Sixteen gallons Two Firkins make the Kilderkin. half Barrel. Rondlet.

256. pints 128. quarts 32. gallons 4. firkins 2. kilderkins 4. bushels make
the Coombe or Barrel.

512. pints 256. quarts 64. gallons 8. firkins 4. kilderkins 2. barrels 8.
bushels make the Quarter or Hogshead.




So the Pint and pound Firkin and bushel Barrel and coombe Hogshead and
quarter
are of like content.

Measures of Corn.
Bushel.
1. ALl kind of Corn and grain is measured by Troy weight.

2. By statute the bushel must contain eight gallons or sixty four pounds or
pints of wheat. 31. Ed. 1.

3. And yet by the book of the Assise imprinted Anno Domini 1597. the bushel
is to contain 56. pounds or pints of Averdopois weight (which is three pounds
or three pints, and eight ounces Troy more then the statute or Troy weight) for
56. pounds or pints Averdepois weight, and 67. pounds 8. ounces Troy weight do
justly agree.

Also every measure of Corn shall be stricken without heap and all purveyance
shall be by such measure. 25. Ed. 3. ca. 10. 15 R. 2. ca. ^. 43. E. 3. ca. 6.


4. Water measure (sold within Shipboard) shall contain five pecks stricken
to the bushel.

5. No person shall buy or sell with a Bushel except it be sealed and marked
by the officer, and according to the Kings Standerd.

6. All sorts of bread ought to be weighed by Troy weight.

7. Post septem dies panis non ponderetur.

8. The Baker shall not sell to any victualler, etc. to be retayled but only
thirteen penny worth for twelve pence, as well man's bread as horsebread.

9. The punishment of the Bakers for their unlawful breads is that that the
Justices of peace or sworn officers in Leets may take away their unlawful
bread, and give it amongst the poor, as officers in corporate Towes are
enabled to do, as it seems in the end of the book of Assise imprinted anno
1597. and all Justices of peace are there willed and required to be ayding and
assisting to the said officers therein, but by the statute 51. H. 3. 51. H. 3.
Bakers and Brewers being convict for not observing the Assise the first,
second, and third time, they shall be amerced according to the offense (if it
be not over grievous) but if the offense be grievous, or often, then shall they
suffer punishment of the body without redemption, sc. a Baker to the pillorie,
and the Brewer to the Tumbrell (now called the Cockingstoole) (as it seems by
Master Lambard 62.) or to some other correction.

Measures of Wine, Beer and Ale, etc.
Wine, Oil and Honey: their measure is all one, sc. the Rondlet, 16. and di.
Barrel, 31. 18. H. 6. ca. 17.
and di. Hogshed, 63. Pipe, 126. Tun, 252.
gallons.

1. Cheese: A weigh of Cheese must contain 32. cloves, 9. H. 6. ca. ^.
and every clove seven pounds of Averdepois weight.

2. Beef, and other flesh are 16. ounces Averdepois to the pound, Dalton fo.
133.
and eight of those pounds to make the stone, except where the usage of the
Country requires more pounds to the stone.

3. Also sixscore herrings shall go to the hundred, ten hundred to the
thousand, and ten thousand to the last. 31. Ed. 3. ca. 2.

4. Wool 14. pounds weight goes to the stone of wool, and 26. Dalton fo.
133. 13. R. 2. ca. ^.
stone goes to the sack, whosoever buyeth wools at greater weight shall pay
double the value to the party grieved and a fine to the King.

5. Of Sugar, Spices, and wax 8. pounds makes the stone and 13. stone and a

Weight. Meas^^^.
13. In anno 8. H. 6. ca. 5. It is enacted as follows, videlicet. whereas by
the great Charter of the liberties of the Realm of England and by a statute
made the xxvij. year of King Edward the third it was ordained and by a statute
made the xiij. year of King Richard the second confirmed, that one weight and
one measure should be through all the Realm of England as well out of the
staple as within; And in the same statute of the said noble King Edward, it is
ordained that the weight called auncell for the great damage and subtle
deceits done by the same measure to the common people, Auncell weight.
shall be utterly left and set apart, and the wools and all other manner of
merchandise, and all other things lying in weight, bought or fold shall be
weighed by the balance, so that the tongue of the balance do not incline more
to the one party than to the other, with weights sealed and according to the
standard of the Exchequer. And he that does contrary to the damage of the
Seller shall forfeit to the King the valor of the goods so weighed or
measured, and that the party complaynant have the quatreble damages. And by the
said statute of the said noble King Richard, it was added, that the offender
shall be imprisoned by two years, and make fine and ransom at the Kings will.
And that the Justices of peace should have power to enquire of the said
defaults, as well at the Kings suit as the parties. Our sovereign Lord the King
by authority of this Parliament, has ordained and stablished, that the
statutes and ordinances aforesaid, shall be firmly kept and holden, and
straightly executed. And moreover for to eschew diverse great mischieves, which
have happened within the Realm of England by the said auncell, and specially
for to destroy the falsity of the regratours of yarne, called yarne Choppers,
it is ordained by our said sovereign Lord the King, by authority aforesaid,
that in every City, Borough, and Town, of the Realm of England, common
balance shall be, with common weights sealed, and according to the Standerd of
the Exchequer, upon the common Costs of the said City, Burgh, or Town, in the
keeping of the Mayor, or Constable of the same, to which balance and common
weight all the Inhabitants of the same City, Burgh, or Town, that have not
such weights, and other that have, if they will may freely weigh without any
thing paying, taking nevertheless of forreyns for every draught within the
weight of xl. li. a farthing, and for every draught betwixt xl. li. and an
hundred an halfpeny, and for every draught betwixt a hundred pound and a
thousand pound a penny at the most, whereof the weights shall be maintained,
and the officers lawfully weighing rewarded by the discretion of the chief of
the City, Burgh, or Town, according to his attendance to the said occupation
be it more or less. And that no man buy yarne of wool called woollen yarne,
unless he will make cloth thereof, nor use weight nor measure, nor other thing
in the place of weight or measure, that is not sealed according to the said
Standerd, nor set any thing to the same by the way of taking or hiding, or in
any other manner that may increase the measure or weight, or let the balance to
have his natural course upon the forfeiture and pain aforesaid, and that the
Justices of peace, Majors, Bailiffes, and Stewards of Franchises have power by
authority aforesaid to examine the Trespassours in this case, and for to
enquire in especial of offenders against this ordinance, and to do execution
against them that be found defective by enquests or by examination, to be made
by the said Judges or officers in this case in the manner as before is said. And
that this ordinance be holden and observed from the Feast of Easter next
ensuing for ever. And that every City upon pain of x.li. every Burghe upon
pain of C.s. and every Town where a Constable is upon pain of xl.s. have a
common balance with weights according to the said Standerd, within two months
after Proclamation made of this ordinance, which pain shall be levied to the
use of our sovereign Lord the King, as often as they shall be defective after
the said Proclamation.

14. There is another statute made in Ireland in anno 12. El. ca. 3. concerning
measures of Corn, whereby it was enacted that two measures of brass should be
made at the Queens cost, one for wheat, Rye, Maslen, Beans, and Peese, and
another for Malt, Oats, and Barley, which shall be the Standerds for the
Shires of the City of Dublin, the county of Dublin, Kildare, Catherlagh,
Wexford, Mead, the Town of Drogheda, Westmeath, Louth, Kings County, and
Queens County, within this Realm, and that the same being marked with the
Crown and letters of her majesty's name, should remain and be as her
highness Standerds for the Shires aforesaid, in her Majesty's Exchequer of
this Realm, in the custody of the Lord Treasurer of this Realm, or of the

Burgesses of every the Shires, Cities, and Towns, before named, assembled in
the same Parliament, and to certain Burgesses of the Borough Towns in the
same Shires should be delivered one measure of every such measures which her
Majesty should cause to be made according to the tenor of the said Act for the
common wealth of her highness subjects within this Realm of Ireland,

City, Town, or Borough, and that the said Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, to
whom the said measure shall be delivered, as is aforesaid, shall surely and
safely convey, or cause the same to be conveyed by the said Citizens to their

as hereafter shall be appointed in this Act, for the good custody of the same
measures withal convenient speed and expedition, there to remain for ever in

officer for the time being of the same City, Borough, or Town, as her
Majesty's Standerds of measure, and that the Inhabitants of all Cities,
Boroughes, or market Towns within every of the said Shires should with all
convenient speed after the same Standerds so delivered as is before prescribed,
make or cause to be made common measures, according to the measures aforesaid
to remain in the said Cities, Boroughes, and market Towns, and every of them,
and the measures to be viewed, examined, printed, signed, and marked, by the
Mayor, Bailiffe, Sovereign, Portriffe, or other head officer, in whose
possession the said Standerd shall remain or by his officer appointed in that
behalf, and that every of the aforesaid Majors, Bailiffes, Sovereigns,
Portriffes, or head officers having the said measures printed, and signed under
the sign and print for the same, with the letters of her Majesty's name
Crowned, should have authority and power to make, sign and print like measures
unto every of her Majesty's subjects duly requiring the same, taking for
marking of every bushel two pence, lawful money of Ireland, and that no
Merchant nor other person or persons within any City, or market Town in any
the Shires before specified, shall buy, sell, or receive any grain, or corn,
with any measure, except it be marked, signed, and printed in manner and form
aforesaid, nor any other person or persons in any Shires before specified out
of the said Cities, Boroughes, and market Towns, except it be like and equal
with the Standerd, ordained and made for the said Shire, precinct or place,
where any such person shall so sell, buy, or receive any such grain, or corn,
and that every person as well without Cities, Boroughes, and market Towns, as
within in every of the Shires above specified shall buy, sell, and receive, and
deliver with a bushel sealed, signed, and marked, after the form aforesaid,
and no otherwise, upon forfeiture of the grain, and corn so sold, bought,
received and delivered, half to the Queens Majesty, her heirs and
successors, and the other half to the party grieved and that will sue for the
same by Action of debt after the course of the common laws of this realm,
wherein no essoyne protection nor wage of Law to be admitted or allowed, and
that all the Majors, Bailiffes, Sovereigns, Portriffes, and other head
officers, of every City, Borough, or market Town, within every the Shires
above said, shall cause twice in the year or oftener, as they shall think
necessary all measures within the said Cities, Boroughes, or market Towns to
be brought before them, and to be duly viewed and examined, and such as they
shall upon examination find defective immediately to be broken and burnt, and
the party or parties which in that behalf has offended, and be found

be unto the said Mayor, Bailiffe, Sovereign, Portriffe, or other having
Jurisdiction or correction in that behalf, and at the second time the said
offenders to forfeite thirteen shillings four pence, and at the third time
likewise to forfeite twenty shillings the same forfeitures to be to the head

have authority to make like process against all persons found as is above said
defective, and for such fynes and amerciaments as upon them shall be assessed,
as if they were endicted before them, for breaking of the Queens peace,
provided always that the examination of the defaults abovesaid, and
punishments of the offenders of every offense committed hereafter within any
City, or Town corporate of this Realm, that have by grant or Charter the
office of Clerk of the Market, or of Justices of peace and their authorities,
or that have by grant or Charter fines, amerciaments, or forfeitures growing

within their several Jurisdictions and authorities in like manner as they

in any wise notwithstanding. And forasmuch as great inconveniences and
intolerable damage have and does ensue by the occasion of diversity of
measures within the Shires above mentioned, and thereby amongst other hateful
evils men are moved to buy in one market, and sell the same grain in another

established that the several Standerds to be made by her Majesty for the
several Shires, Cities, and Towns, before named shall keep and hold the

Maslen, Beans, and Peese, shall contain 16. Ale gallons, and the bushel for

These two last statutes I have rehearsed at large because upon them two, the
authority of the Justice of peace out of the Sessions chiefly depends.

Warrants and Presidents. CHAP. 72.
1. Warrants and presidents which concern the exercise of the office of a
Justice of peace out of the general Sessions, are of several sorts, viz. they
concern either Treasons, Felonies, Misprisions, Praemunires, forcible Entries,
forceible detainers, Riots, Routs, and unlawful assemblies, security of the
peace, and good behavior, or other misdemeanors or offenses of several sorts.

2. As concerning Treasons, and felonies, upon information made of any Treason
or felon committed, any one Justice of peace may direct his warrant to the
Sheriff or to the high Constables or petty Constables, or to all or any of
them to make search for the traitors or felons, and also for the stolen goods.

A warrant to apprehend a Traitor may be thus.
2. Comitat. Dublin.
A.B. Esquire one of his Majesty's Justices of peace within the County of D. To
the high Sheriff of the said County and to all high Constables, petty
Constables, and other his Majesty's officers greeting, etc. Whereas E. F. and
G. H. are vehemently suspected to have committed Treason whereof I have
received Information. These are therefore in his Majesty's name straightly to
charge and command you and every of you upon sight hereof without any delay
within your several Bailiwickes, Hundreds, Baronies, and Constablewicks, to
make diligent search for the bodies of the said E. F. and G.H. and them or
either of them so found, to attach and arrest, and immediately upon such arrest
to bring before me at my house at Dale in the said County, whereof you may not
sail at your peril, sealed with my seal and dated the first day of January
in the xiij. year of the Reign of our sovereign Lord King Charles of
England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, defendor of the faith, etc.

3. The like warrant may be made for the apprehension of felons, mutatis
mutandis.

A warrant to search for stolen goods may be thus.
Comitat. Dublin.
4. A.B. Esquire one of his Majesty's Justices of peace within the County of
Dublin. To the Sheriff of the said County and to all high Constables, petty
Constables, and all other his Majesty's officers greeting, etc. whereas E. F.
has informed me that diverse goods and cattle, viz. xx. l. in money, etc. (and
so name all the goods) have been lately stolen from him, these are therefore
in his Majesty's name, straightly to charge and command you, and every of you,
upon sight hereof presently without delay in all suspected houses and places
within your several Bailiwickes, Hundreds, Baronies, and Constablewicks, to
make diligent search for the said goods, and where you shall find the same or
any part thereof, to arrest the parties in whose houses, or possessions the
said goods or any part thereof shall be so found, and so them arrested to bring
before me to my house at Dale with all convenient speed, whereof you may not
fail at your peril sealed with my seal and dated the (...) day of (...) etc.

5. When any of the said felons, or traitors shall be so arrested and brought
before the Justice of peace, the Justice must take the examination of the
traitors or felons, in writing but not upon oath, and must examine them upon
all circumstances, whereof he shall receive information from the accusers, and
upon such other circumstances as he in his own discretion shall think fit,
for the discovery of the Treason or felony.

The form of the Examinations may be thus.
6. The Examination of A.B. etc. taken before me R.B. one of his Majesty's
Justices of peace in the County of M. the first day of February in the xiij.
year of the Reign of our sovereign Lord Charles by the grace of God King of
England, Scotland, France, and Ireland defendor of the faith, etc.

The said examinat. being duly examined says, etc. and so set down every
particular answer that the prisoner shall make, to the questions that shall be
demanded of him.

7. This being done, the Justice of peace must take the examinations of the
accusers, and such other as can give any evidence material against the
prisoner, and their examinations must be taken in writing severally and that
upon oath.

The form whereof may be thus.
8. The examination of A.B. etc. taken before me C.B. Esquire one of his
Majesty's Justices of peace, in the County of Dublin the first day of March in
the xiij. year of the Reign of our sovereign Lord Charles by the grace of
God King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland defendor of the faith, etc.

This examinat. being duly sworn upon the holy Evangelist and examined upon
his oath, says, etc. and so set down at large all the material circumstances
that he shall declare to prove the treason or felony.

9. This being done the Justice of peace must make a Mittimus to convay the
prisoner to the County Jail.

The Mittimus may be in this form.
10. Comitat. Cavan.
A.B. Esquire one of the Justices of peace in the County of C. to the keeper of
his Majesty's Jail in the said County greeting: I send you therewithal the
body of E.F. late of G. labourer brought before me this present day and charged
with the felonious stealing of one black horse of the goods of I.H. and
therefore these are in his Majesty's name to command you that immediately upon
sight hereof you receive the said E.F. into your custody, and him safely keep
in his Majesty's Jail of the said County, until he shall be thence delivered
by due order of his Majesty's Laws, whereof you may not fail, as you will
answer for your contempt at your peril, dated at Dale the first day of
January, etc.

11. I do not like of the Mittimus commonly used in Ireland that is to send
the prisoner from Constable to Constable, for I find by experience that
thereby many notable offenders do escape, and then many times go into
Rebellion to the great prejudice of the common wealth, but I like better that
he should be convayed to the Jail by the Constable of that Constablewicke
where he was apprehended, and that by a sufficient guard at the charge of the
Constablewicke, for which the Justices of peace shall do well to conceive a
general order at their general Sessions of the peace.

12. This being done the Justice of peace must take a several Recognisance of
every one of the accusers, and of every one that can give evidence against the
prisoner, the form of which Recognisance may be thus.

Com. Dublin.
13. Memorandum quod tertio die Aprilis anno Regni Domini nostri Caroli Dei

monetae de bonis, and Catallis, terris and tenementis suis fieri and levari ad

The condition of the above Recognisance is such that whereas one A.B. late of
C. labourer was this present day brought before me, and was charged with the
felonious stealing of one black horse of the goods of the above named B.E. and
thereupon was sent by me the above named Justice of peace, to the Kings
Majesty's jail of the said County of Dublin: If therefore he the said B. E.
shall and will at the next general jail delivery to be holden in the said
County, prefer or cause to be framed and preferred a bill of indictment of
the said felony against the said A.B. and shall and will then also give
evidence there concerning the same as well to the Jurors that shall then make
enquiry of the said felony as also to them that shall pass upon the trial of
the said A. B. That then the said Recognisance shall be void, or else, etc.

14. The like Recognisance must be taken severally of all such as can give any
material evidence against the prisoner with the like condition.

15. And in cases of Treason the like Recognisance must be taken as in felony
mutatis mutandis.

16. Also the Justice of peace ought to return the said examinations and
Recognisances at the next jail delivery or else he is to be fined.

17. Now concerning Misprisions and Praemunires, the Just. of peace may make
out a warrant to apprehend offenders in this form following, viz.

A.B. Esquire one of his Majesty's Justices of peace within the County of
Lowth, Lowth.
To the Sheriff of the said County, and to all and singular the high
Constables, petty Constables, and all other his Majesty's officers in the said
County greeting.

These are in his Majesty's name straightly to charge and command you, and
every of you, within your several Bailiwickes, Hundreds, Baronies, and
Constablewickes, to make diligent search for the body of O.D. late of E. in the
County aforesaid labourer, and him so found to attach and arrest and presently
without delay to bring him before me at my house in Dale in the said County to
answer to such matters as on his Majesty's behalf shall be objected against
him, hereof you may not fail at your peril. Sealed with my seal and dated,
etc.

18. And in all cases where the prisoner is baileable which you may find in
the Chapter of Bail and Mainprise the prisoner may be bailed by two Justices
of peace whereof one to be of the Quorum, the form of which bail may be as
follows, viz.

Memorand. quod vicessimo die mensis Iulij Anno Regni Domini nostri Caroli Dei

Or thus if the prisoner be indicted.

19. Note that upon this last president the mainperners shall be fined at the
discretion of the Justices, if the prisoner make default to appear.

20. These bailes must be returned by the Justices of peace at the next jail
delivery, or otherwise they are fyneable.

The form of the warrant to enlarge the prisoner that is bailed as aforesaid
may be thus.
21. Lovid.
A. B. and C. D. two of his Majesty's Justices of peace in the County of Lowth,
To the keeper of his Majesty's jail of the said County greeting. Forasmuch as
R. B. of, etc. labourer has before us found sufficient mainprise to appear
before the Justices of the jail delivery at the next general jail delivery,
to be holden in the said County, there to answer to such things as shall be
then on the behalf of our said sovereign Lord objected against him, and
namely to the felonious taking of two sheep of the goods of I.S. for the
suspicion whereof he was taken and committed to the said jailer: We command
you on the behalf of our said sovereign Lord, that if the said R.B. do
remain in your custody, for the said cause and for none other, then you
forbear to grieve or retain him any longer, but that you deliver him thence
and suffer him to go at large, whereof you may not fail at your peril, given
under our seals the 20. day of, etc.

Forceible Entries, etc.
22. Concerning forceible Entries, and forceible detainers any one Justice of
peace to whom complaint shall be made ought to view the force, and if at his
coming he find the possession held by force, he must remove the force, and to
that end he may take to his assistance, the Sheriff of the County and so many
others as he shall in his discretion think fit for this service, and he must
also send to prison all such as he finds upon his view committing the force,
or holding by force and must make a record of the same, which record must
remain amongst the records of the peace, or else be certified into the Kings
Bench which may be done without any Certiorari.

The form of the Record of a force may be thus.

24. Com. Dublin.
John Style Esquire one of the Justices of peace of our sovereign Lord the
Kings Majesty within his said County of Dublin, to the keeper of his Majesty's
jail in the said County, and to his Deputy and Deputies there and to every of
them greeting. Whereas upon complaint made to me this present day by A.B. of
Killmainham in the said County Yeoman I went immediately to the dwelling house
of the said A.B. in Killmainham aforesaid and there found C.D.E.F. and G.H. of
Killmainham aforesaid Laborers forceibly, and with strong hand and armed
power, houlding the said house, against the peace of our said sovereign Lord,
and against the form of the statute of Parliament thereof made in the
fifteenth year of the Reign of our late King Richard the second, therefore I
send you by the bringers hereof the bodies of the said C.D. E.F. and G.H.
convicted of the said forceible houlding, by my own view, testimony, and
record, commanding you in his Majesty's name to receive them into your said
Jail, and there safely to keep them, until such time as they shall make
their fynes to our said sovereign Lord for the said trespasses and shall be
thence delivered by the due and orderly course of Law, whereof fail you not
upon the peril that may ensue thereof. Given at Dale under my seal the day
of, etc.

Upon this recording of the force, the Justice of peace may not restore the
possession to the party that was put out, without first making enquiry by a
Jury, and to that end he must make a precept to the Sheriff in nature of a
venire facias.

The form of the precept may be thus.

upon every Iuror that makes default, and at the return of the pluries 5.l. and
at every day after the issues are to be doubled until a full Jury appear, and

appears hereafter title Certiorari with some little alteration.

The form of proceeding upon the statute of North-hampton made in Anno secundo
Ed. 3. ca. 3. the effect of which statute is as follows, viz.
39. No man whatsoever (except the Kings servant and Ministers in his presence,
or in executing his precepts or their offices, and such as shall assist them,
and except it be upon Cry or Proclamation made for Arms, to keep the peace,
and that in places where such Acts do happen) be so hardy to come before the
Kings Justices, or other his Ministers doing their offices with force and
Arms, nor bring any force in Affray of the country, nor go nor ride armed by
night, or by day in Faires or Markets, or in presence of the Justices, or other
Ministers, nor in any place elsewhere, upon pain to forfeit his armor to the
King, and his body to imprison at the Kings pleasure. 2. Ed. 3. cap. 3.

40. Upon this statute, he that is put out, or holden out of his land with
force, uses to have at this day a writ directed out of the Chancerie, either
to the Sheriff only (as Master Fitzh. in his Na. Br. fol. 149. rehearses it,
for I find it not in the Register of writs) or else custodibus pacis ac
vicecomiti and eorum cuilibet (as the common manner is) commanding that
Proclamation be made upon the statute, and that if any be afterward found
offending against the same, they shall be committed to prison, there to remain
until some other commandment be given concerning them) and that their armor
and weapon shall be prised, and the same answered to the use of the Kings
Majesty.

41. But forasmuch as that Justice of peace, (to whom this writ shall be
delivered) is to make execution of the same, as a minister only, and is to
certify his doing therein, I think good to lend these few helps toward it.

42. At his coming to the place, where the force is supposed by this writ, he
may cause three O yes for silence to be made with this or such another
Proclamation.

43. The Kings Majesty's Justice of his peace straightly charge, and in his
Maj^sties name commands all and every person to keep silence, whilst his
Majesty's writ upon the statute made at North-hampton, in the second year of
King Edward the third his noble Progenitor (delivered to the said Justice) be
read and Proclamation be made thereupon accordingly.

44. Then may he read the writ, or declare the effect thereof in English.

45. After that let three other O yes be made, and thereupon may this
Proclamation follow.

46. His Majesty's said Justice does in his Highness name, and by virtue of
his said writ straightly charge and command that no manner of person, of what
estate, degree, or condition soever, now being within the house of B. etc.
named in the said writ, shall go armed, nor keep force of armor or weapon,
nor do any thing there or elsewhere in disturbance of his Majesty's peace, or
in offense of the said statute upon the pains of loosing his said armor and
weapon and of imprisoning his body at his Majesty's pleasure.

God save the King. 47. This done the Justice may enter, and search whether
there be any force of armor, or weapon worn or borne against this
Proclamation, or otherwise he may enquire thereof by a Jury, for so the writ it
self does warrant him to do, and if any such be found he ought to imprison
the offenders, and to seize and apprise the Armor and weapon so found with
them, but if (upon the Proclamation made) they do depart in peaceable manner,
then has he no warrant by the writ to commit them to prison.

48. But now let me show him a form of Certificate (or return) of this writ
into the Chancery, and then make an end.

49. Upon the back of the writ these words may be endorced, viz.

50. Executio istius brevis patet in quadam scedula eidem brevi consuta.

The scedule may be thus.
51. Ego Johannes Twysden armiger. unus custodum pacis Domini Regis in Com.
Dublin certifico, in Cancellariam dicti Domini Regis, quod virtute istius

in dicto brevi precipitur, and quod quidem A. and D.E. de F. in Com. praedict.
Laborers. predictam Proclamationem parvi pendentes post Proclamationem
predictam ibidem sic factam armati iverunt, as armatam potentiam ibidem
duxerunt, scilicet. duas galeas, unum arcum et december sagittas, duos gladios et
totidem pugiones in perturbationem pacis dicti Domini Regis, ac terrorem populi
sui necnon in contemp. statut. in dicto brevi specificati manifestum. Ac

A.B.C.D. et E.F. de B. predict. Yeomen ad hoc juratos. Qui dicunt super
sacramentum suum pred. quod predictae duae galea valent december solid. et quod
dict arcus et december sagitti valent sex sol. et quod gladij predicti valent
viginti sol. et quod dicti pugiones valent quinque solid. et sic quod armatura

52. By this you have seen, what one Justice of the peace ought to do in the
execution of this statute as a Minister, and by the same you may also see, what
he may do therein of himself ex officio as a Judge, and without any writ
brought unto him.

53. For not only by the plain words of the statute of Northhampton, the
wardens of the peace have power (within their wards) and are commanded to
execute this Act upon a pain, but also by good implication in the Commission
it self, every Warden of the peace has the statute of Northhampton committed
to his charge, so that both in the matter and manner, the doing is all one
saving that, if he do it as a Judge, he needs not to make any Proclamation
(the statute being a prohibition in it self) nor yet to send any certificate
into the Chancery but only to make his own Record of that which he shall do
in this behalf, and thereout to send an estreate into the Exchequer, that the
King may be answered of the armor, or of the value thereof.

54. And here (perhaps) the redemption of the imprisonment may be at the
discretion of the same Justice, even as in^^^ statutes of 15. R. 2. and 8. H.
6. it seems to be, but therein my adv^ shall be the same that I gave them
before; Adjoining this that in (...) execution of this statute of Northhampton,
the Justice of the peace has to do with the removing of the force only, and
may not meddle with any restitution of the possession.

which ought to be made to the King and the Council in case that by this
enquiry the truth of the fault and Riot be not found, such certificate may be
done in English by way of a letter, comprehending the truth of the whole matter
with the certainety of the time, place, and other circumstances of the fact and
Riot, together with the certainety of the names of the Riotters, as also of the
names of such, who by maintenance, embracery, or otherwise were any impediment
to the finding thereof, with their several misdemeanors, which certificate or
letter is to be directed and sent by the said Justices of peace and Sheriff,
or undersheriffe into the Starchamber or Kings Bench, etc. within one month,
see antea tit. Riots.

Rules and observations concerning as well Indictments of forceible Entries and
Riots as other Inditements and presentiments.
For the form of indictments, in cases of forceible Entry and Riots I have
here before set you down presidents: Nevertheless for that these indictments
be the chief foundation whereupon the whole business and trial is after to
be grounded and built, I thought it not amiss to observe here these few
general rules, as well concerning the matter as the form of these, and all
other indictments or presentiments to be taken before Justices of the peace.

1. First in these indictments of forceible Entry, and Riots, (as also in all
other endictments of felony or trespass) it is good to say contra pacem, or
other words to that effect.

2. Also these words, vi et armis, viz. gladijs, etc. are of necessity to be
used in Ireland, especially if the circumstances of the fact do require them,
for these circumstances do either aggravate or diminish the offense, Stamf.
fo. 94. because the statute of 37. H. 8. ca. 8. 37. H. 8. ca. 8.
which makes them needless is not of force in Ireland. But these words vi et
armis, etc. are needless in an Indictment of forceible Entry, because they are
employed in the word force.

3. Also in indictments founded upon statutes, it is not needful, Co. 484.
nay it is not safe to recite the statute at all, for as the recital is not
necessary, so the misrecitall thereof is fatal to the endictment and makes it
void, but it is safe and sure to draw the endictment with this conclusion, sc.
Contra formam statuti in hujusmodi casu provisi ac editi, Dyer 363.
if the indictment be founded upon one statute or contra formam diversorum
statutorum in hujusmodi casu edit. et provis. without naming any special
statute where many statutes do concern one offense, and where it is ambiguous
whether one or more statutes do concern the matter in question, the safest
way to conclude is contra formam statut. in hujusmodi casu edit. et provis.
short, which may refer to one or more statutes, as the case shall require.

4. Yet the offense against the statute must be certainly described in the
indictment, and the material words in such statute must be fully set down
therein. Plow. 97.

5. Also all indictments and presentiments being in the nature of declarations
for the King against the offenders, ought to contain certainety, and therefore
six principal things be most commonly requisite in all presentiments before the
Justices of peace, viz.

1. The names and surnames as well of the parties indicted, as of the parties
offended, with the addition of the degree or mystery and dwelling place of the
party endicted.

Yet in some cases, an endictment, quod procuravit personas ignotas, or quod
bona cujusdam ignoti cepit, etc. or the like, may be good, See Br. Indictments
6. 10. 11.

2. The time, scil. the day and year when the offense was done.

3. The place, scil. the Town and County where it was done, Br. Indictment 24.
41. 42.
as at B. in the County of C.

4. The name er quality of the thing in which the offense is committed, viz. of
dead things, it may be bona, et catalla, expressing them certainly, of live
things equum, bovem, ovem, etc. but not bona, et catalla, so of entry, etc.
into lands, etc. to express certainly whether it be a house, land, meadow,
pasture, wood, etc.

5. Also the value or price of the thing, is commonly to be set down, to
aggravate the fault.

6. The manner of the fact, Br. endictments 7. et 36.
scil. the manner and nature of the felony or trespass.

Also indictments ought to be framed so near the truth as may be, and the
rather for that they are to be found by the Jury upon their oaths.

7. Yea an endictment being veredictum, id est, Co. 4. 47.
dictum veritatis and a matter of record, ought to set forth all the truth that
by Law is requisite, for de non apparentibus et non existentibus eadem est
ratio, and every part of the endictment material ought to be found by the oath
of the Jurors, and is not to be supplied by averment.

Process.
1. The form of Process upon indictments of Trespass, which also the
Justices of peace out of sessions may in some few cases make out against
offenders as it seems.

2. As the authority of making process upon endictments, is given by express
words in the Commission to the Justices of peace in their Sessions, so is it
given by express words in some statutes to the Justices of peace (yea to one
Justice of peace) out of their sessions to make process upon endictments
found, (before them) against offenders, or upon information against them, as if
they were endicted of Trespass in Sessions, as in cases of forceible Entry,
etc.

3. Also in some other cases, and by some other statutes this authority of
making out process (against offenders) by the Justice of peace out of their
Sessions seems to be employed of congruence, or rather of necessity, as where
any statute does give power and authority to the Justices, or Justice, of peace
out of their Sessions, to enquire, hear, and determine, (as hic tit. Riots)
tit. Tyle, and tit. Weights, in these and in all other such cases where the
Justice may enquire, hear, and determine there, after indictment or
presentment of the offense, the said Justice may make out process against such
offenders, to cause the offenders to come and answer, for unless the
offenders do come in, either gratis or by process, the Justices cannot
proceed to hear, and determine, again in the former cases of Tyle and
Weights, as also in all other cases where any statute does give power to the
Justices of peace, out of their Sessions, to hear and determine, either upon
the confession of the offenders, or upon examination of witnesses, in all such
cases it seems, the Justices of peace may grant out their warrant against
such offenders to appear before them, to answer to their said offenses, and
thereupon may proceed to examine, hear, and determine the offense, as being
convict thereof, upon such confession, or examination without any indictment or
process.

Now these process may be as follows.
First if the offender be absent, a venire facias A Venire facias.
shall be awarded by the Justice or Justices of peace under his or their own
test, and if thereupon the offender be returned sufficient (and makes
default) then a distringas Distringas or capias.
shall be awarded, which distringas shall go forth infinite, till the offender
come in, but if a nihil habet, etc. be at the first returned, then after the
venire facias, first a capias, then an alias and after a pluries shall go
forth, and after that an exigent till the party be taken or yield himself, or
else be outlawed. And these are the ordinary process upon all indictments of
trespass against the peace, or of other offenses against penal statutes, not
being felonies, or a greater offense, but this process is commonly grounded
upon an endictment and is only to cause the offender to come in, and to make
his answer, and therefore if the offender be present and confess such
indictment, information or offense, then needs there no process at all, for
he shall be committed forthwith to prison there to remain till he has paid
his fine, or given sureties for it. 1. H. 7. 20. Br. Imprisonment 100.

Also these process shall be always directed to the Sheriff who is the
immediate minister and officer of the King, to execute all process, except the
Sheriff himself, or his officers be parties, but if the Justice of peace be
to grant out process against the Sheriff, under-sheriffe, or other officers,
offending contrary to the statute 8. H. 6. ca. 9. It seems such process
shall be directed to the Coroners of the County and shall be served by them,
and so are diverse books, as 2. H. 6. fo. 12. 8. H. 6. fo. 30. 9. H. 6. 11.
and 18. Ed. 4. fo. 7. and others, and so also the oath of the Justice of peace
seems to bind them.

Note also that this Process ought always to be made in the name of the King,
and for that the King is a party, Br. franchise 18.
it must also be with a non omittas propter aliquam libertatem, etc. but the
Test thereof may be under the name of the Justice of peace.

If the offendour be within any liberty or Franchise, yet the Sheriff is to
enter the Franchise, and to execute the Process himself, and not to write to
the Bailiffe of the Franchise, because the King is a party, see 41. Assise p.
17. Br. Franch. 18. 31.

The forms of these Process to be made by the Justice of Peace out of the
Sessions seem to be as follows.

These Process are sent forth to the end that either the party shall come, or
be brought in to make his answer, Dalton 369.
and to be justiced by the Law, or else that (for his contumacy) he shall be
outlawed, and so to be deprived of the benefit of law, but the power of the
Justice of peace ends with the Outlawry, for they can make no capias
utlagatum, but must certify the Outlawry into the Kings bench.

Also all such Process (as well of capias, etc. as of Outlawry) may be stayed
by a supersedeas, Dalton 369.
issuing from other Justices of peace (out of Sessions) testifying that the
party has come before them, and has found sureties for his appearance to
answer to the endictment or to pay his fine, etc.

Note that this authority of the Justice of Peace in sending out these
Process, being out of their sessions is beyond the bounds of their Commission,
and again by the Commission The Commission. 14. H. 7 8. Br. peace 6. 7.
one Just. of Peace alone cannot grant a capias, nor other Process, but two
Justices of Peace at the least must do it, and that sitting in the Court, and
in their Sessions, and yet nevertheless in these former cases, the statutes
(expressly, or by necessary implication) giving such authority to the Justices
of Peace, or to any Justice alone, and that out of Sessions are a sufficient
warrant and Commission to the Justice of peace, as it seems.

Traverse.
After that such Process, Dalton 369.
or any other Process ad respondend. be awarded against the party, it seems
he may come and yield himself to pay his fine, or else he may offer his
Traverse to the indictment found against him before the Justice of Peace, and
the Justice ought to allow him his Traverse against it, which traverse is to
take issue upon the chief matter of the indictment, or to deny the point of
the indictment.

But although the Justices of Peace have power in some cases as aforesaid (out
of their general Sessions) to take indictments, and after such indictment
found to award process ad respon. against offenders, and to hear, and
determine thereof, and the offenders also have liberty to come in and to
speak, and answer for themselves, and may offer their Traverse, and that the
Justices of peace are to allow of and to receive the same, yet quaere whether
the Justices of peace out of their general Sessions may try such traverse
being tendered to them, without which trial all the rest may seem idle, or
that upon the traverse tendered they must certify or send the Inquisition or
indictment so found before them into the Kings Bench, or unto their quarter or
general Sessions of the peace, there to be tried and determined, howsoever it
is safest (after such traverse tendered) to certify or deliver such Inquisition
or indictment into the Kings Bench or to their next quarter Sessions, and so to
refer the trial of the traverse and further proceedings therein to them.

Certiorari.
The return of a Certiorari, sent to remove an endictment may be thus.

First upon the backside of the writ of Certiorari endorse these or the like
words.

Executio istius brevis patet in quadam scedula eidem brevi annexa. And that
schedule may be thus.
Ego Mich. Dalton unus Custod. pacis, ac Iusticiar. Dom. Regis ad pacem in
dict. Com. Dublin conservand. necnon ad diversa felonias, transgr. et alia
malefacta in eodem Com. perpetrata, audiend. et terminan. assig. virtute istius
brevis mihi deliberati indictam. illud (unde in dicto brevi fit mentio) una cum
omnibus idem indictamentum tangent. in Cancellar. dicti Domini Regis distinct
et aperte sub sigillo meo certifico, In cujus rei testimonium, ego prefatus
M.D. his presentibus sigillum meum apposui. Datum (...) die mensis (...) Anno
Regni, etc.

Then take the record of the indictment and close it within the schedule and
seal, and send them up both together.

Now to show what is further meet for the Justices of peace to know concerning
this writ of Certiorari, and their certifying or return thereof.

After an endictment found before Just. of peace, a Certiorari is procured by
the means of some party indicted or grieved, thereby to remove such indictment
from the said Just. and to convey it to Just. of a higher authority, to the end
the party may either traverse such endictment above, or may there avoid it for
insufficiency of form or matter.

F^tz. Na. Br. ^0. 245.
And this Certiorari is the Kings writ issuing sometimes out of the Chancery,
and sometimes out of the Kings Bench, and may be directed to any Court of
Record, or officer of Record (as to a Justice of peace, Sheriff, Coroner, or
Escheator) to be certified of any Record which is before any of them: and first
an alias then a pluries, and lastly an attachment lies against them that
should send it, if the Record be not certified accordingly or it seems a sub
poena is used at this day.

If it be returneable into the Chancery then are the words in Cancellaria
nostra, and if into the Kings Bench, then the words are coram nobis ubicunque
etc. mittatis.

The Certiorari may be sometimes to remove, Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 245.
and send up the Record it self, and sometimes but only the Tenor of the
Record (as the words therein be) and it must be obeyed accordingly.

If there be variance between the Certiorari, Plo. 393.
and the Record which is to be removed, the Justices need not to certify such
Record.

A Justice of peace may deliver, Crompton fo. 132. a. and 133. b.
or send into the Kings Bench an endictment found before him, or a Recognisance
of the peace taken by him, or a force recorded by him without any Certiorari,
but if a Justice of peace having a Record with him, be discharged of his
office, now he cannot certify it without a Certiorari, although he be made a
Justice of the peace again, See 8. H. 4. fo. 5. Br. Record 64.

If a Certiorari be to send up the indictment of A. in which endictment some
others be endicted together with the same A. yet need not the Justices of peace
to make certificate concerning any but A. for although they be named jointly,
yet be they indicted severally, and the King may pardon A. without forgiving
the other. 6. E. 4. 5. 6. Ed. 4. fo. 5.


If a Certiorari shall come to the Justices to remove an endictment and the
party sueth not to have it removed, but suffers it to lie still, 9. H. 7. 16.
Br. Judgment 17.
yet it seems the Just. of peace ought (ex officio) to send it away, because
the writ contains in it self a commandment to them so to do, and so is a
supersedeas, of it self to the Just. of peace to stay their other proceedings.

And albeit the Certiorari be a supersedeas of it self, Fitz. Na. Br. 237.
yet may the party upon the Certiorari purchased have a supersedeas also
directed to the Sheriff, commanding him that he arrest him not, Fitzh. fo.
237. in which place also he doubts whether the Justices of peace themselves
ought not of duty to award their own supersedeas to the same effect, after
that the writ of Certiorari is brought to their hands.

If a Certiorari come to the Justice of peace to remove an endictment and in
truth the indictment was not taken till after the date of the Certiorari, yet
if the endictment be removed thereby, Dalton 371.
it is good enough, for that they both be the Kings Courts (1. R. 3. 4.) and in
such case it is now usual to remove it.

All the higher Courts at Dublin may write to the Justices of peace to certify
their Records, that do make for the trial of causes in them depending, as you
may read 19. H. 6. 19. where they of the common place did send to the Justices
of peace for an endictment, because in a writ of conspiracy brought before
them, it was material to have it.

In some cases the Justice of peace may certify a Record by him made, Dalton
fo. 372.
or found before him out of Sessions without any writ of Certiorari therefore
to him directed, vide antea tit. forceible Entry.

In other cases he must of duty certify the proceedings, but may spare to
certify the Record until a Certiorari come to him for it, see hereof antea
title Surety for the peace.

For the manner of the writ of Certiorari, to remove Records from one Court to
another, or from the Just. of peace or other officers of Record, to any the
higher Courts of Dublin, etc. there are diverse forms and sorts thereof, as
you may see in Fitz. Na. Br. fo. 242. etc.

I will only set you down one form for all.

The form of a Certiorari out of the Chancery, to certify a Recog. taken by a
Justice of peace in the Country, for the keeping of the peace.

Concerning the surety of the peace.
When a writ of supplicavit which in old time was called breve de minis as
appears by the Register directed out of the Chancery, is delivered to a
Justice of peace, he is to direct his precept or warrant to compel the party
upon that writ, to find surety for the peace as appears by Fineux chief
Justice in 21. H. 7. fol. 20. the form of which precept or warrant may be thus
in English.

George Multon one of the Justices of peace of our sovereign Lord the Kings
Majesty, within the County of Dublin, Com. Dublin.
to the Sheriff of the said County, and to all the high Constables of the
several baronies within the said County, and to all petty Constables and all
and singular other the Kings Majesty's Bailiffes and other ministers, as well
within liberties as without in the said County, and to every of them greeting.
Know ye that I have received the commandment of our said sovereign Lord the
King by his Majesty's writ of supplicavit in these words, reciting the whole
writ of supplicavit, which is not always of one form, because it is sometimes
directed to all the Justices of the peace, sometime to them and the Sheriff,
and sometimes to one Justice alone, or reciting only the effect of the
supplicavit thus.

Know ye that I have received the commandment of our said sovereign Lord the
King by his Majesty's writ of supplicavit, to compel A. B. of D. in the said
County Yeoman to find sufficient sureties for his Majesty's peace by him to be
kept toward C.D. of the same Town of Dale in the said County Tailor, and
therefore on the behalf of our said sovereign Lord I command and charge you
jointly and severally that immediately upon the receipt hereof you cause the
said A.B. to come before me at my house in Dale in the County aforesaid, to
find sufficient surety and mainprise for the peace to be kept toward our said
sovereign Lord, and all his liege people and especially toward the said C.D.
and if the said A.B. shall refuse thus to do, that then you him safely convey,
or cause to be safely conveyed, to his Majesty's jail in the said County,
there to remain until he shall willingly do the same, so that he may be
before the Justices of the peace of our sovereign Lord within the said County
at the next general Sessions of the peace to be holden for the said County,
there to answer to our said sovereign Lord, for his contempt in this behalf,
and see that you certify your doings in the premises, to the said Justices at
the said Sessions bringing then thither this precept with you, Given at dale
under my seal the fourth day of, etc:

The form of the Recog. of the peace to be taken upon the said writ of

And this may be done also by a single Recognisance in latin with a Condition
added or endorsed in english in manner following.

The Condition of this Recognisance is such that if the above bounden I.S.
shall keep the peace of our sovereign Lord the King, toward the Kings
Majesty and to all his liege people, and especially toward A.B. of C.
aforesaid Yeoman, that then the said Recognisance to be void or else, etc.

This Recognisance of the peace being thus taken by virtue of a supplicavit,
the Justice of peace being in this case but a Minister, and not a Judge, must
make return of the writ and a certificate of his doing therein into the Court
from whence the supplicavit did issue in this form following, viz. upon the
back of the writ of supplicavit, he must write thus.

Executio istius brevis patet in quadam scedula eidem brevi annexa, and then
subscribe his name to it. The schedule may be thus, which must be fixed to the
writ of supplicavit.

The like certificate may be made into the Kings Bench if the writ of
supplicavit issue out of that Court mutatis mutandis.
And if a Certiorari be directed out of the Chancery to the Justice of peace,
for removing this Recog. because it was not sent up together with the
certificate as there is no necessity it should be, then that writ must be
returned in this manner, viz:

Upon the back of the writ the Justice of peace must write thus.

Virtute istius brevis, Ego P.H. unus custodum pacis Domini Regis, in Com.

The like may be made into the Kings Bench mutatis mutandis, if the writ issue
out of that Court.

If the supplicavit be against diverse, and the party that prosecuteth the
same, will release his prayer of the peace against one of them, then the
release ought to be certified for him, and the writ must be served for the
rest, or else non est inventus may be certified for him that is released, and
the writ served for the rest.

The form of the Release may be thus.

A Justice of Peace may also by virtue of his office, and as he is a Judge
command this surety to be found, and this he may do either of his own motion
and discretion, or else at the request and prayer of another.

When it is at the Prayer of another he may make out his precept or warrant in
this form following.
Charles by the grace of God King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland
Defendor of the Faith, etc.
To our Sheriff of the County of Dublin, Com. Dublin.
the Constable of the Barony of Castleknock, and to all and singular our
Bailiffes and other our ministers in the said County as well within liberties as
without, greeting.
Forasmuch as A. B. of Kilmainham, yeoman, has personally come before George
Bring of the said Town Esquire, one of our Justices of the peace within the
said County, and has taken a corporal oath that he is afraid that one C.D.
of Killmainham in the said County yeoman, will beat, maime, wound or kill him,
or burn his houses, and has therewithal prayed surety of the peace against
the said C. D. Therefore we command and charge you jointly and severally that
immediately upon the receipt hereof you cause the said C.D. to come before the
said G.B. or some other of our Justices of the said County to find sufficient
sureties and mainprise as well for his appearance at the next quarter Sessions
of our peace to be holden in the said County, as also for our peace to be kept
toward us, and all our liege people and chiefly toward the said A.B. that is
to say, that he the said C.D. shall not do, nor by any means procure or cause
to be done any of the said evils to any of our said people, and especially to
the said A. B. And if the said C.D. shall refuse thus do, that then
immediately without expecting any further warrant, you him safely convey or
cause to be conveyed to our common jail in the said County, there to remain
until he shall willingly do the same, so that he may be before our said
Justices at the said next general Sessions of the peace to be holden in the
County aforesaid, then and there to answer unto us for his contempt in this
behalf; And see that you certify your doing in the premises to our said
Justices at the said Sessions, bringing then thither this precept with you:
witness the said G.B. at Killmainham aforesaid the fourth day of August. etc.

The like warrant may be in the name of the Justice of peace himself in this
form following, viz.
A. B. Knight, Com. Dublin.
one of the Justices of the peace of our Sovereign Lord the King within the
County of Dublin,
To the Sheriff of the said County, To the Constable of the Barony of C. and
all other Constables, Bailiffes, and other his Majesty's officers in the said
County as well within liberties as without, greeting.
Forasmuch as B.A. the wife of W.A. of D. in the said County Labourer has
required surety of the peace against T.B. of the said Town of D. Butcher, and
withal has taken her corporal oath before me, that she requires the same
not for any private malice, hatred, or evil will, but simply that she is
afraid of her life, or the hurting or mayming of her body or the burning of her
houses; These are therefore to will and require you, and in his Majesty's name
to charge and command you, that immediately upon the sight hereof, you or one
of you require the said T.B. to come before me, or some other of the Kings
Majesty's Justices within the said County to find sufficient sureties, as well
for the appearance at the next general quarter Sessions of the peace to be
holden for the said County, as also that the said T.B. shall in the meanetime
keep the Kings Majesty's peace, as well toward his said Majesty, as toward
all his liege people, and especially toward the said B.A. and if he shall
refuse so to do, that then immediately you do arrest and convey the said T.B.
or cause him to be conveyed to his Majesty's jail of the said County, there to
remain until he shall willingly do the same, and see that you certify your
doings in the premises to the Justices at the said Sessions, and have you
there this warrant

dated at, etc.
The form of the Recognisance of the peace may be thus.

Or the like may be upon a single Recognisance with a Condition in form
following.

The Condition of this Recognisance is such, that if the above bounden W.S.
shall personally appear before the Justices of our said Sovereign Lord the
King at the next general Sessions of the peace to be holden in the said County
of Dublin, to do and receive that which by the Court shall be then and there
enjoined him, and in the meanetime do keep the peace of our said Sovereign
Lord the King toward the Kings Majesty and all his liege people, and
especially toward A. B. of C. in the County aforesaid Yeoman, That then the
said Recognisance to be void, or else, etc.

The form of a Supersedeas for the peace may be thus. Com. Dublin.

A. B. Esquire, one of the Justices of peace of our Sovereign Lord the Kings
Majesty within the County of Dublin,
To the Sheriff, Bailiffes, Constables, and other the faithful ministers, and
subjects of our said Sovereign Lord within the said County, and to every of
them sends greeting.
Forasmuch as A.B. of etc. Yeoman has personally come before me at, etc. and
has found sufficient surety (that is to say, C.D. and E.F. etc. Yeomen, The
supersedeas is good though it name neither the sureties nor the sums.
either of which has undertaken for the said A.B. under the pain of Twenty
pounds, and the said A.B. has undertaken for himself under the pain of forty
pounds) that he the said A.B. shall well and truly keep the peace, toward
our said Sovereign Lord, and all his liege people, and especially toward G.H.
of etc. Yeoman. And also that he shall personally appear before the Justices
of the peace of our said Sovereign Lord, at the next general Sessions of the
peace to be holden for the said County of Dublin, Therefore on the behalf of
our said Sovereign Lord, I command you, and every of you that you utterly
forbear and surcease to arrest, take, imprison, or otherwise by any means for
the said occasion, to molest the said A.B. and if you have, for the said
occasion, and for none other taken or imprisoned him, that then you do cause
him to be delivered, and set at liberty without further delay. Given at D.
under my seal this last of July, etc.

The form of the precept or warrant for the good behavior may be thus.
Concerning the good behavior.

I. S. Knight, one of the Justices of peace of our Sovereign Lord the Kings
Majesty, within the County of Dublin,
To the Sheriff of the said County, and to all high Constables, petty
Constables, and to all and singular Bailiffes, and other his Majesty's
Officers, and Ministers as well within liberties as without, in the (...) County
and to every of them greeting.
Forasmuch as A.B. (...) in the said County labourer is not of good name or
fame, nor of honest conversation but an evil doer, a Riotter, Barretor, and
perturber of the peace of our said sovereign Lord, I command you and every of
you, that immediately upon sight hereof, you cause the said A.B. to come before
me, or some other of my fellow Justices to find sufficient surety and
mainprise as well for his good abearing toward our said sovereign Lord, and
all his liege people until the next general Sessions of the peace to be
holden in the said County, as also for his appearance then and there, and if he
shall refuse so to do, that then immediately, without expecting any further
warrant, you him safely convey or cause to be safely conveyed to his Majesty's
jail in the said County, thereto remain until he shall willingly do the
same, so that he may be before his Majesty's Justices at the said next general
Sessions of the peace to be holden in the said County, then and there to
answer for his contempt in this behalf, and see that you certify your doings
in the premises to the said Justices, at the said Sessions, bringing then
thither this precept with you

dated at, etc.
Or it may be thus.
I. S. Esquire, one of his Majesty's Justices, etc. (as in the next precedent
president) Forasmuch as I have been credibly informed that A.B. of C. in the
said County labourer, is a man of evil behavior, one that daily moves
discord, strife, and dissension amongst his neighbors, and a common perturber
of his Majesty's peace: These are therefore in the Kings Majesty's name to
command you, etc. as in the former president.

This warrant for the good behavior, although it may be granted by one Justice
of peace alone, yet it is usually granted by two and may be also in Latin in
this form following.

Upon good sureties taken for the good behavior, a Supersedeas may be granted
for the good behavior as well as for the peace, and the same may be in the same
form, as the supersedeas for the peace is mutatis mutandis. Libro intra. fo.
61. Cromp. 232.
Many other Supersedeasses may be granted by the Justice of peace out of
Sessions for otherwise it were mischievous for the party, as well by reason of
his imprisonment as also for that otherwise he may be outlawed before the
Sessions, if the Justice of peace, Dalton 333.
might not take sureties of him for his appearance.

And Master Crompton is of opinion that these may be granted by any one Justice
of peace, with whom agrees the book of Entries, Cromp. 234.
but Master Lamberd thinks it not in the power of any one Justice of peace,
to grant such supersedeas at this day, li. intr. 601
but that it must be done by two Justices at the least, and the one being of
the Quorum, nevertheless for that I find the old presidents to run in the
name of one Justice of peace alone, I have drawn these accordingly,
notwithstanding I would advise the joining of two Justices herein, the one to
be of the Quorum, if they may conveniently begotten.

Towns, Parishes, and Hamlets, upon (...) at night next coming, for the
finding out and apprehending of all Rogues, Vagabonds, and wandering and idle
persons, in or about the said several Towns, Parishes, or Hamlets, and that
such as shall be found and apprehended, you do cause them to be brought before

which shall be brought before the Justices upon such search (after examination
of their idle life, taken by the Justices) are either to be whipped by the
Constables of the Town where the Iu. sit. 11. Caroli ca. 4. in Ireland.
Or else from thence are to be sent to the house of correction, and to be
conveyed thither by the Constables that brought them, which services imposed
upon the Constables, are some cause of their neglect of this service, and
therefore I have set down another course and president perhaps no less
serviceable, which also may be performed and done every month, or every
meeting of the Justices, if need shall so require: or if the Justices cannot,
or shall not meet, yet it seems, such warrant may be granted out by any one
Justice of peace as follows.

These are in the K. Majesty's name, to charge and command you, that you
together with the petty Constables of the several Towns, Parishes, and
Hamlets, within your Barony (taking sufficient assistance out of the said
Towns) do make a general privy search within every of the said several
Towns, Parishes, and Hamlets, upon (...) at night next coming, for the
finding out, and apprehending of all Rogues, Vagabonds, and wandering idle
persons in or about their said several Towns, and that such as shall be found
and apprehended, you do cause them to be punished in every several Town or
Parish where they shall be so apprehended, by the petty Constables of every
several Parish respectively, and by them also further to be conveyed according
to the statute. And if any of the said Rogues shall appear to be dangerous or
incorrigible, that then you cause such to be brought before me, or any other of
his Majesty's Justices of peace, to be further dealt withal according to the
statute in such cases provided, dated, etc.

Afterward any one of these Justices may take the examination of, or proof
against such dangerous Rogues, and finding cause, may then commit such Rogues
to the jail, and from thence he may by two Justices of peace be sent to the
house of correction.

This authority of removing petty Constables and of choosing and swearing new,
is reputed properly to belong to the Leete (it being one of the most ancient
Courts in the Realm Br. Leet. 14.) and if the new elect be not present at the
Leet to take his oath accordingly, then upon certificate or notice thereof to
any Iu. of P. of that County, the Just. does use to send his warrant for the
party so chosen and to give them their oath.

Also in default of the Leet, or otherwise, where there shall be just cause,
every Just. of peace ( ex officio as it seems) may remove the old Constables,
and may choose and swear new, which also we see to be warranted by common
experience. And I have seen some presidents to such purpose as follows.

To our loving friend A. B. of W. Yeoman.
These are in his Majesty's name to charge and command you, to make your
repair unto us, or to some other Just. of P. of this County, to take the oath
of a Constable to serve his Majesty within the Town of W. according to the
choice made of you by the Jury at the last Leet holden in your Town. And
hereof fail you not, dated etc.

The form of the oath concerning the office of a Constable.
You shall swear that you shall well and truly serve our sovereign Lord the
King in the office of a Constable: you shall see and cause his Majesty's peace
to be well and duly kept and preserved according to your power, you shall
arrest all such persons, as in your sight and presence shall ride or go armed
offensively, or shall commit or make any Riot, Affray, or other breach of his
Majesty's peace you shall do your best endeavor (upon complaint to you made)
to apprehend all Traitors, Felons, Barretors, and Riotters, or persons
riotously assembled, and if any such offendour shall make resistance (with
force) you shall levy Huy and Cry, and shall pursue them until they be taken,
you shall do your best endeavor that the watch in your Town be duly kept and
that Huy and Cries be duly pursued according to the statute of Winchester. And
that the statutes made for the punishment of Rogues and Vagabonds, and night
walkers, and such other idle persons coming within your bounds or limits, be
duly put in execution, you shall have a watchful eye to such persons as shall
maintain or keep any common house or place where any unlawful game is or
shall be used. As also to such as shall frequent or use such places or shall
use or exercise any unlawful games there or elsewhere, contrary to the Laws
and statutes of this Kingdom, you shall well and duly execute all precepts
and warrants to you directed from the Justices of P. of this County, and you
shall well and duly according to your knowledge power and ability do and
execute all other things belonging to the office of a Constable so long as you
shall continue in this office. So help you God.

This oath I have set down the more largely, thereby to show the principal
matters whereof the Constables are chiefly to have care.

THE SECOND BOOK.
The Description of the general Sessions of the Justices of Peace. CHAP. I.
1 I Have so largely in the former book set forth the power and authority of
one or more Justices of peace out of the general Sessions that I shall not
need to be long in setting forth their power and authority and the forms of
their proceedings in their general Sessions.

2. The general Sessions of the peace is an assembly or a meeting of two or
more Justices of peace, whereof one must be of the Quorum for the executing of
their general authority.

3. This general Sessions of the peace is grounded chiefly upon the words of
the second Assignavimus in the Commission, Lamb. li. 4. fo. 379.
the which being vos, et quoslibet duos vel plures vestrum, quorum, etc. do
very necessarily require the presence of one of the Quorum, and these general
Sessions by the statute of 2. H. 5. ca. 4. are to be holden at four times in
the year, viz. in the first week after the feast of Saint Michael the
Archangell, the first week after the Epiphany, the first week after the
Easter week, and the first week after the translation of Saint Thomas the
Martyr, which is the third of July or oftener if need require.

4. And these three things namely to enquire, Lamb. li. 4. fo. 379.
hear and determine do (in effect) comprehend whatsoever belongs to the
general Sessions, so that every thing whereof I shall hereafter entreat will
concern either the information of the Justices by enquiry, or otherwise the
hearing and trial of the cause it self, or the judgment and execution (which
is the determining) given and done upon it.

Who shall appoint the Sessions of the peace, and how and where. CHAP. 2.
1. THe Justices of the peace do (at their Sessions) take knowledge of causes
within their Jurisdiction, either by the oath of Enquirors, Lambard. li. 4. fo.
380.
or by the Presentment or Declaration of other men, and this inquiry is first
prepared, by the appearance of the officers and Country, and by the Articles
given in charge, and then performed by the presentment (or indictment) of them
that had the charge to make it.

2. Now albeit that these Sessions be commonly and most orderly summoned by a
precept in writing, yet is it not altogether of necessity (for the making of a
lawful Sessions) to have it so, for if competent Justices of the peace do get
men to serve and thereupon do hold a Session without any precept before
directed, Lamb. li. 4. fo. 380.
all presentiments made before them by twelve lawful men, shall be of force in
Law, but no man shall loose any thing for his default of appearance there,
because no man had notice of their sitting.

Lamb. li. 4. fo. 381.
3. Nevertheless, because the common and more allowable manner is, to call the
officers and County together for this service, by a precept to the Sheriff,
wherein both the disposition of the Just. is notified for the holding of a
Session, and the service and attendance of those others is commanded to be
thereat. It will be needful to set forth the form thereof, which may be thus.

Precept to summon the Sessions of the peace. Lamb. li. 4. fo. 381.

predict. die Martij Anno Regni dicti Domini nostri Regis Caroli dei gratia, etc.

5. This precept may be made (as here it is) by any two Justices The number of
the Justices.
of the peace, so that the one of them be of the Quorum, for two such may hold
a Session of the peace, as it does plainly appear by the Commission: Lamb.
li. 4. fo 382.
and therefore as Master Marrow says, it suffices not to have it run under
the name of the Custos Rotulorum alone, seeing that he has no more authority
in this behalf, then any one of his fellows has, for the words of the
mandamus in the Commission to the Sheriff be coram nobis, etc. venire facias,
tot and tales, etc. yea, if two such Justices make a precept for a Session of
the peace, all their fellow Justices cannot discharge it by their Supersedeas,
but a Supersedeas out of the Chancery may discharge it.

6. Lamb. li. 4. fo. 383.
And if one Justice of peace alone will take upon him to hold a Sessions of the
peace (that was lawfully summoned by him, and another such Justice) and will
make the style of the Session in the names of himself and the other, all
presentiments so taken before him may be avoided, but if the Sessions be in
truth holden by two sufficient Justices only, and the style, or title thereof
be made in the names of three, then all the presentiments before them shall
stand good, for it will not help the party to say, that one of the three was
not there, when it shall appear that two of them (the one being of the Quorum)
were present, which will suffice, by Marrow.

7. But the place The place.
of holding them is arbitrable, and at the pleasure of the Justices themselves,
so that it be meet for access, and although the precept do appoint the
Sessions to be holden in some one Town by name, Lamb. li. 4. fo. 383.
yet may the Justices keep it in any other Town, and all the presentiments
shall be good that shall be taken where they hold it, but then again, no
amerciament can be set upon any man for his default of appearance, because he
had no warning of it. Mar.

8. Lamb. li. 4. fo. 384.
So if two such Justices make a precept for a Session to be holden in one
Town, and two other Justices make another precept for another Session to be
holden at another Town, (or in any other part of the said Town) the same day,
then the presentiments taken before either of them shall be good, Mar. and then
it seems, that he that serves at the one Session (as a Iuror or officer)
shall be excused for his default at the other, because as they both be the
Kings Courts, and of equal authority, so he cannot present himself in both
of them at once.

What persons ought to appear at the Sessions, and therein of the Custos
Rotulorum, the Records of the Sessions, and the Clerk of the peace, and how
the Jurors ought to be qualified and ordered, and of the privilege of the
Sessions. CHAP. 3.
1. FOr the better preparation toward this Inquiry, let us peruse the persons
that are to attend and do service at the Sessions.

2. The Justices of the Peace be so necessary, The Justices and their equality.
as without them (though all others should appear) no Session can be kept:
and yet if any of them be absent, Lamb. li. 4. fo. 385.
their fellow Justices cannot amerce them, as the Just. of Assise may do, for
their absence at the jail delivery, for inter pares non est potestas, and the
authority of all the Justices of the peace at the Sessions is equal, so that
like power has he which is not of the Quorum with him that is, except it be in
special cases set forth in the Commission and statutes, and therefore it was
holden (3. H. 7. Fitz. tit. Justice of peace 3.) that if one which is not of
the Quorum, will be so bold as to rebuke one that is of the Quorum, he and his
companions may not commit him to prison for it, neither will any discreet
Justice take liberty hereby to carpe at or scorn any of his Colleagues, because
he is equal with them, but will rather draw from thence a lesson to use them
with all lenity and modesty, seeing that in authority they be not inferior to
him.

Lamb. li. 4. fo. 386.
3. And albeit the power of these Justices be joint at the Sessions, yet (to
some purpose) each one has a distinct power by himself also, for if one of
them sitting in this Judicial place shall see a Riot he may cause the parties
to be arrested, and may also record the Riot, whereby they shall be so
concluded, as they shall have none answer to it, Fitzherbert tit. Justice del
peace 9.

4. But two sorts of men there are, that especially owe their ordinary
attendance at the Sessions, that is to say the officers or ministers of the
Court, and the Jurors of the County.

5. Amongst the officers the Custos Rotulorum The Custos Rotulorum.
has worthily the first place, both for that he is always a Justice of the
Quorum in the Commission, Lamb. li. 4. fo. 387.
and amongst them of the Quorum a man (for the most part) especially picked out
either for wisdom, countenance, or credit, and yet in this behalf he bears
the person of an officer, and ought to attend by himself or his Deputy, and as
he is an officer he may be fined for his neglect.

6. For the words in the Commission be to him by his proper name, quod ad dies
et loca predicta, brevia, precepta processus et indictamenta predicta coram te,
Who shall keep the Commission of the peace.
et dict. socijs tuis venire facias: Whereas until the 14. year of the Reign
of King Richard the second, that charge was general to all the Justices, and
not special to any one person of the Commission.

9. E. 4. fo. 2. 10. H. 7. fo. 7.
7. This man (as his very name declares) has the custody of the Rolls (or
Records) of the Sessions of the peace, and of the Commission of the peace it
self.

8. But under the name of the Records of the Sessions of the peace, The Records
of the peace. Lamb. li. 4. fo. 388.
I do not comprehend all manner of Records concerning the peace, but those
only which ought to be at the Sessions, as Bills, Plaints, Informations,
Indictments, Presentiments, the Rolls, of processes, Trials, Judgments,
Executions, and all other Acts of the Sessions of the peace themselves, and
furthermore the ingrossement of the Rates of servants wages, all Recognisances
of the peace and good Abearing, Recognisances, concerning Treasons, Felonies,
and such like as ought to be certified (or brought) to the Sessions of the
peace, must be numbered amongst the Records of the Sessions of the peace, for of
all these there may be use in the Sessions, and therefore the Custos Rotulorum
or some for him ought to be ready there to show them.

9. For which end it is meet, that howsoever those Records have heretofore
been suffered to lie in the hands of the Clearke of the peace, and by the
death and remove of him, have been to seek, yet now the inconveniency being
found, and the Records themselves being drawn to greater bulk, the same
should be lodged in some special and proper Room under safe custody, and not
without an Inventorie (or Register) indented, whereof the one part to remain
with the Custos Rotulorum, and the other with the keeper of them.

10. Lamb. li. 4. fo. 389.
Although it were before time at the liberty of a Justice of peace to certify
a Recognisance of the peace to the Custos Rotulorum, as you may see in 2. H. 7.
1. Yet now by the statute of (3. H. 7. ca. 1.) he ought to certify, send, or
bring it to the next general Sessions of the peace, that the party may be
called, and to the end also, that his default, (if he make any) may be
recorded, and by such Record of his default he is concluded to say that he
appeared there.

11. As for precepts for surety of the peace, the special Records for
conviction of forceible Entries, Riots, and such like as be made out of the
Sessions of the peace by particular Justices, and be to remain with
themselves, and not appointed to be certifyed thither, I cannot reckon them in
the number of the Records of the Sessions of the peace, no more then I may well
do the Inrollments of bargains and sales, and such other Records lying in the
charge of the Custos Rotulorum or Clearke of the peace.

12. And now as this man is (by name and office) keeper of the Records of the
peace, so would it not a little amend the service if he were indeed also
careful for the due preservation of them, and would not loosely leave them (as
commonly it is found) to the only custody of the Clearke of the peace, without
having any Register of their number and sorts, and without appointing any
convenient place certain, for the more ready search and safe bestowing of
them, whereby it falls out very often that after the death of such a Clearke,
these Records are hardly recovered and that by piece meal from his widow,
servants or executors, who at their pleasure may embezell, misuse, or conceal
what they will, the which, how far it may reach to the loss of his Majesty
in his escheats, fynes and forfeits royal, and to the hurt of his subjects
as well in their purchases of lands (the Inrollments whereof also are not
always orderly disgested) as in their goods, and toward their persons by the
filching of Bonds, Endictments, or Processes, I leave to be debated and decided
in the Court of their own consciences that take this charge upon them.

13. The Clearke of the peace Clerk of the peace.
owes his attendance also at the Sessions, for he reads the indictments, and
serves the Court, he inrolleth the Acts of the Sessions, and draws the
process, he must Record the Proclamations of rates for servants wages, and
many other things.

14. All which things he cannot do, if he be not present, so that he is an
officer of this Court, and is the Clearke to the Justices as the statute of 12.
R. 2. ca. 10. names him, and not (as Master Marrow thought) the Clearke of the
Custos Rotulorum.

15. You may read also in 2. H. 7. that if a Recognisance of the peace be
brought in to the Custos Rotulorum, and the party grieved will not sue forward,
then the Clearke of the peace (who is the Clearke and Attorney of the King,
says that book) shall call upon it for the Kings advantage.

16. Furthermore the Coroners The Coroners.
(as the common form of the precept shows) ought to be present at the
Sessions, because the Coroners be parties to the Exigents, and the Judges of
the utlary, howbeit they are besides that Conservators of the peace also, and
may in some cases commit men to prison, and therefore ought to be at the
Sessions to object against them.

17. The Seriffe The Sheriff.
in like manner ought to attend at the Sessions for the double duty that he
bears, the one as Sheriff to return the precept, to take the charge of
prisoners, and so to serve the Court otherwise as he has in charge by the
mandamus that is mentioned in the Commission, the other, because he also has
care and charge of the peace.

18. The Bailiffes of Franchises and the Constables Bailiffes and Constables.
of Baronies are to serve here, the one as Ministers, and the other as Jurors,
and therefore ought to give their attendance.

19. And every of those may be amerced, if they make default.

20. But especially here ought to appear such Jurors, as be returned by the
Sheriff, and warned by his Bailiffes, whether it be for enquiry or trial,
Jurors for enqu^ry and trial.
and in this behalf both the Commission, the common form of the precept, and
the Law it self (in 11. H. 4. cap. 9.) wills that they should be probi and
legales homines.

21. For if any of them be discredited in Law, as by attainder in conspiracy
attaint, decies tantum, subornation, of perjury, concealment or such like,
they be not probi, and their presentment will be void, unless there be twelve
besides them, that are not so blemished.

22. Again if they be outlawed, abjured, condemned in a praemunire, or
attainted of Treason, Felony, or such like; then be they not legales, and their
presentiments are merely void also, as it may be gathered upon the case in 11.
H. 4. 41.

23. And women, Infants under 21. years of age, Aliens, and such as be within
orders of the Ministry or Clergy cannot be impanelled amongst others. Marrow.

24. Generally also, Lamb. li. 4. pa. 396. et 397.
the Jurors ought either to be inhabiting within the shire, or else to have
lands there, for the Commission wills that they should be such per quos rei
veritas melius sciri poterit which must needs be understood of such as have
causes to know the Country, and the precept is usually according to the same
form.

25. If any of these Jurors returned, Lamb. ibid.
be threescore and ten years of age, or have any continual infirmity, or be
otherwise decrepit, yet that shall not excuse him for not appearing, if the
Justices will exact his service, but he is driven to his Action upon the
statute of (Westminster. 2. ca. 38.) against the Sheriff for his returning of him.
Marrow.

26. And if he have a Charter of exemption, he ought to show it to the Sheriff
against whom (if he will notwithstanding empanell him) he may have only his
Action upon the case, and none other remedy, 18. H. 8. 5. 18. H. 8. fo. 5.
which may be truly said, as to the saving of his issues, but by some other
books, and namely 42. Ass. p. 5. 48. Ass. pa. 5.
and Marrow, he is to be discharged upon his appearance and specially where he
he has in his charter of exemption these words licet tangat nos, unless his
exemption be grounded upon a false suggestion or that it fall out that there
want others that be sufficient to serve and furnish the number, in which case
none is to be spared. Lamb. li. 4. page 397.


27. ^amb. li. 4. page 398.
Now although some of the Jurors of this enquiry be of affinity, (or
consanguinity) with any party grieved that procures the Indictment, yet that
hinders not their presentment, howbeit it is no good discretion for the
Justices if they know it to suffer any such to be empanelled if there be a
sufficient number of others to be had.

28. But the men be not truly Jurors, till they be sworn, How they of the
Jury must be sworn and ordered. Lamb. ibid.
as their name pretends, and otherwise their presentment is utterly void, and
if it should (by any over sight) happen that they or some of them were not
sworn at all, yet if the Record make mention, that they be sworn, their
presentment is of force enough, for the Record may not be gainesaid.

29. And the Justices may (upon cause) remove a Iuror The number of Jurors.
after he is sworn, 20. H. 6. 5. again, if after the swearing of a Jury their
service be put of till the next day upon any urgent occasion, then may they be
sworn of new, as if they had not before appeared, 7. H. 4. 38. 7. H. 4. fo. 38.


30. Each Jury ought to contain twelve in number at the least, Lamb. li. 4.
page 400.
and if there be more, it shall not be amiss, but if twelve of them do agree
the gainesaying of the residue cannot hinder the presentment, yea the Law was
in the time of King Etheldred that in a Jury of twelve the agreement of eight
should stand and make a good verdict, but the Law is otherwise used and taken
at this day.

31. The Justices ought not to commit these Jurors of enquiry to any keeper,
nor to keep them without meat and drink, Lamb. ibid.
nor to carry them out of the Town, and yet they may adjourne them to any
other place in the same County to give their verdict.

32. If these Jurors do wilfully conceal offenses, Concealment.
presentable and that be complained of by Bill, Lamb. ibid.
then may the Justices choose an enquest of persons whereof every one may
dispend 40.s. by the year to enquire of their concealements, and if any such
be found every one of the first enquest shall be amerced in full Sessions by
the discretion of the same Justices. 3. H. 7. ca. 1.

33. And because the Jurors of those days were yet wilful in their
concealements, it was provided within eight years after that the Justices of
peace should determine causes upon information without any such presentment,
but that ordinance endured not long.

34. Nevertheless it is to be wished, that these and other enquirors would
more carefully employ themselves in that service, which is the chief and
almost the only ground whereupon the Justices are to work, considering that
rarely any other then common promotors (that hunt for private gain, and are
not led by zeal of Justice) will be entreated to inform against the offenders.

35. And this shall they the better do, if they will be directed by these few
Counsels following, viz. First, that they come prepared to further the good of
their country, and not to save their issues, or to serve for fashion sake, then
that they give credit to credible persons sworn to inform them, Thirdly, that
they measure their doings by the right line of Law, and not by the crooked
coard of a pretended equity and counterfeit conscience. Furthermore, that they
hold not a Court of common pleas by admitting proof of witnesses against the
King as knowing that they are not to try an issue, but to offer an Information,
the truth or falsity whereof shall be afterward tried by another Jury, upon
which trial the party indicted shall be heard to speak for himself. To keep
council.
Finally, that they discover not their own doings, for it is usually a part of
their oath, that they shall keep the Kings Council and their fellows, and we
read in Fitz. tit. Coron. 207. and 272. that to endict a man of felony and then
to show abroad to others what they have done therein, has been taken for
felony, howbeit that offense is now holden to be fineable only.

36. And now as all these owe their service at the Sessions Privilege of the
Sessions.
either by reason of their office, or by virtue of the summons, so all others
also may freely attend there, if not for any thing that specially concerns
themselves, Lamb. li. 4. page 402.
yet for the advancement of public Justice, and for the service of the King,
and to this end, they are invited thither (as I may say) by a certain freedom
of access, and by protection from common arrests, a thing that is incident to
each Court of Record, and without which Justice should be greatly hindered, so
that if a man come voluntarily to the Sessions, with the mind, either to
prefer any bill of indictment, or to give Information against any other or to
tender a fine upon an Indictment touching himself, or do come compelled to
make appearance for to save his bond, and be arrested by the Sheriff upon
common and original process, in his coming thither, or during his tarrying
there, it seems that upon examination of the matter upon his oath he shall be
dismissed thereof by the privilege of this Court, even as is used in the
higher Courts of Justice.

Of the Articles that are to be given in charge at the Sessions of the peace.
CHAP. 4.
1. IT was the ancient manner, that twice in the year at the Sheriffs Turn
(which was sometime a Court of great authority and called Shiremoote) the
Bishop of the Diocese, and the Alderman (or Earl) of the shire should be
present the one to inform the people in the Laws of God, and the other to
instruct them in the Laws of the land, as appears by Master Lambert li. 4.
page 404. Lamb. li. 4. page 404.


2. And it were to be wished, that as there is commonly at every Assize a
Sermon utred by some learned man, so also the like might be at each general
Sessions of the peace: for seeing that the Laws of men must be obeyed for God,
it does of necessity ensue, that he which will seek to have man obeyed
rightly, must first cause God to be preached truly.

3. The Justice of peace (says master Fitz.) for their parts be bound to
inform the people and (no doubt) the charge is given, as well to instruct the
ignorant least they offend unawares, as to enquire of those that have already
fallen into danger by offense, and thereof it is, that many statutes do
expressly command, that they shall be openly read (or declared) at the Sessions
as you shall see, in place fit for it.

4. But the manner of giving the charge, and receiving the verdict at this day
differs from that which the Justices in Air The ancient order of giving the
charge in Air.
were wont to use, for you may see in Bract. fol. 116. that first one of the
Justices did open before the whole Assembly the benefits of the service in
hand, the commodities of keeping the peace, and the evils of the contrary, and
that then the Articles of the charge were read by one and one to the Jurors,
who receiving the same at the hands of the Justices, did also make answer (in
the yielding up of their verdict) to each article severally, and by it self.

5. Which custom as it had many profits, so it is worthy in mine opinion to be
recontinued and brought in use again.

6. Neither ought, the multitude of Articles (now inquireable) to discourage
any man in this behalf, for if those laws which be most serviceable either
for the present time, or for the place, or other just respect, were only
touched or run over, by way of short Articles, then would there be the more
time afforded for speech that might be well spent, as well in discourse of
exhortation or dehortation, as in the larger handling of such other stat.
whereof there is greater use and necessity, and this liberty the Justices in
Air themselves did use also, as the same M. Bract. in the same place reports.

7. The points of the charge The points of the charge div^ded.
that we have in hand may be reduced into five several heads, videlicet: 1.
Treasons. 2. Felonies. 3. Misprisions. 4. Praemuniries. 5. Fyneable offenses.


8. The four first heads of the charge, videlicet, Treasons, Felonies,
Misprisions and Praemuniries are so fully and at large set forth in the first
Book under their proper Titles, that it were needless in this place to make
repetition of them again, but refer the Reader to their proper Titles in the
first Book, so it rests now to speak of the last head or part of the charge
which is Fyneable Offenses, and these consist of four parts, videlicet:
Offenses of 1. Force and violence. 2. Fraud and deceit. 3. Omission and neglect
in Officers and others. 4. Other abuses and offenses tending to the prejudice
of the Commonwealth.


9. The first of these four are Riots, Routs, unlawful assemblies, forceible
Entries and Forceible Detayners, and all other Trespasses whatsoever committed
upon the body, goods, or lands of any person, or done in disturbance of the
peace, or terror of the people; And as for Riots, Routs, unlawful assemblies,
forcible Entries and Detayner, and all riding or going armed in terrorem
populi, vel perturbationem pacis, they are likewise so largely and particularly
expressed under their apt Titles before in the first Book, whereunto I refer
the Reader, that it were but lost labor to recite them here again, and
therefore I will proceed to the rest of the Articles of the charge, which are
these, videlicet:

1. If any person have maimed another, whereby he is the less able to defend
himself in fight, as by putting out his Eye, stricking of his hand, finger or
foot, or by beating out his foreteeth or breaking his Scull, the offenders and
their assistants therein are to be punished by a grievous Fine and Imprisonment.

2. If any man have unlawfully assaulted, beaten or wounded another or have
committed any Trespass against the body of another, or has unlawfully taken
his goods or committed any Trespass in his lands, this is punishable by Fine
and imprisonment at the discretion of the Court, having respect to the
greatness or smallness of the offense.

3. If any person have unlawfully broken or destroyed the head of any Pond,
mote, stew or several pit, wherein Fishes are put by the owner thereof, or
have wrongfully fished in the same with intent to take away the Fishes against
the owners will, or have wrongfully entered into any Park used for keeping of
Dear, and have hunted, killed, or driven out the Dear, or have taken away
young Hawks or the Eggs of Hawks out of the woods of any other person, this
is a Trespass punishable at the common Law, by Fine and imprisonment, and by
statutes made in England, videlicet in 5. El. ca. 21. and 3. Iac. ca. 13. it is
punishable by Fine, 3. months imprisonment and bonds of the good behavior for
7. years, and although these statutes be not of force in Ireland, yet they may
in some sort guide the discretion of the Justices in assessing the Fine, and
inflicting imprisonment for a longer or shorter time, and the like will fall
out in many other cases which are offenses at the common law, and for which
special punishments are inflicted by several statutes in England, and are in
Ireland punishable at the common Law, by Fine and imprisonment only, of which
statutes I shall make mention as they shall happen to fall in my way.

4. If any person shall rescue any distress that is taken for rent or other
service or damage feasant, he is to be punished by fine and imprisonment at
the discretion of the Court, if there were just cause of taking such distress.

5. Breaking of common Pounds or private Pounds, and taking out the distresses
there impounded, is inquirable and punishable by fine and imprisonment at the
discretion of the Court.

Of the indictments and presentiments given by the Jurors, and of the matter and
form, and receiving and rejecting of them. CHAP. 8.
1. THe preparation to this Enquiry thus made, let us go near and look also
into the performance of the same, Lamb. li. 4. page 485.
the understanding or knowledge which the Justices of the peace do take by the
travel of these enquirors, is by their report put in writing and commonly
called an indictment, or presentment between the two, which words (howsoever
they be confounded, or not rightly distinguished, in common speech) me thinks
that there does easily appear a true and certain difference.

Presenment and indictment. Ibid.
2. For I take a presentment to be a mere denuntiation of the Jurors themselves
or of some other officer (as you shall hereafter hear) without any
Information, and an endictment to be the verdict of the Jurors grounded upon
the accusation of a third person, so that a presentment is but a declaration of
the Jurors (or officers) without any bill offered before, and an endictment is
their finding of a bill of accusation to be true.

Endictment.
3. An indictment ought therefore to be the verdict of Jurors that be charged to
enquire of that offense which is presented by them, for if A. be indicted of
stealing the goods of B. and pleads thereto not guilty, Lamb. li. 4. page 486.
and the Jury finds that C. stole his goods, and that A. took them from him,
but not feloniously, this verdict shall not stand for an indictment against C.
because that Jury had no charge to enquire generally who did the felony, but to
try specially whether A. were hereof guilty or no. 13. Ed. 4. 3.

4. But if A. be arraigned upon an Indictment of murder taken before the
Coroner, Ibid.
and is not found guilty; Now the Jury ought to find who is guilty thereof,
and if they say that C. killed the man, that verdict shall serve for a good
endictment against C. because the Jury had taken so much in charge, ibidem.

5. This also is generally true, that all bills, informations, and indictments
grounded upon penal statutes (wherein the King only is to reap the
forfeiture) ought to be commenced within three years next after the offense
committed, and if the suite be given to any other person for him and the King,
that ought also to commence for the King within three years, but if a common
person shall inform for himself and the King, then the Information, etc. must
be commenced within one year next after the offense done, otherwise it is
merely void, unless longer or shorter time be limited by that special
statute upon which the Information, indictment, or presentment is made and
framed. 28. H. 8. cap. 21. in Ireland.

Lamb. li. 4. page 487. and 488.
6. Furthermore all indictments, forasmuch as they be in the nature of a
declaration, ought to contain certainety, and therefore (as says Master
Marrow) five principal things be most commonly requisite in presentiments
before the Justices of peace, viz.

1. First the name, surname, and addition of the party endicted.

2. The year, the day and place in which the offense was done.

3. The name of the person to whom the offense was done.

4. The name and value of the thing in which the offense was committed.

5. The manner of the fact, and the nature of the offense, as the manner of the
Treason, murder, felony, or Trespass.

6. The name and surname The name and surname.
of the party indicted must be certainly expressed, and if the indictment be
of an accessory in felony, the name of the principal must be set down also,
for if the indictment be quod A. mandavit euidam ignoto occidere B. quod fecit,
this is vicious, Ibid.
but in Treason, Trespass, or Murder, where all be principals, it may be quod
procuravit personas ignotas to do the Treason, Trespass, or Mayheime. Mar.
and Lambart li. 4. page 488.

7. Besides the name and surname of the party indicted, there ought also (by
the statute 1. H. 5. ca. 5.) in every presentment wherein process of utlary
lies, to be added his estate, degree, or mystery, Lamb. li. 4. page 488.
and the County, Town, Hamlet, or place, where he is, or was conversant, and
even so ought it to have been at the common Law, touching names of dignity
made by creation, as Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, Archbishop, Bishop,
Knight, or Sergeant at the Law, because every of these titles were accounted
parcel of the name, but it was not so, for the names of Baron, Banneret and
Esquire which are names of dignity without creation, nor for Chancellor,
Treasurer, Chamberlain, Sheriff, Coroner, Escheator, Bailiffe, Deane,
Archdeacon, Deacon, prebendary, or parson, which are names of dignity by reason
of office only, unless the presentment did charge them in respect of their
offices, for then the name of office also as Bailiffe or Escheator ought to be
used in the indictment. Marrow.

8. But now Baron, Knight, Esquire, Gentleman, Alderman, Degree or mystery.
Widow, Single woman, Deane, Archdeacon, Parson, Doctor, Clerk, Parish Clearke,
are good additions of estate or degree (as I take it) within the meaning of
this statute of additions, but farmer, servant, Lamb. li. 4. page 489.
Butler, Chamberlain are not, because they be common to Gentlemen, and Yeomen,
and they be uncertain, so Merchant, Grocer, Mercer, Tailor, Broker,
Husbandman, Hostler, Labourer, Lighterman, Waterman, Spinner, etc. be good
additions of mysteries, but Citizen is not, because it is no mystery, Art, or
degree, neither is Extortioner, Maintainer, Vagabond, Heretic, Dicer, Carder,
or such like, any good addition, because they are every one evil and against
the Law.

9. And this part of the addition of estate, degree, or mystery must always be
knit to the proper person for Sybilla Batt nuper de T. in Com. D. uxor Iohannis
Batt nuper Spinster was rejected, Dyer fo. 47.
because Spinster was more properly to be referred to John (which is the last
antecedent) then to Sybilla Collect. Dyer 47.

10. Also by the said statute (as I said) the addition ought to comprehend the
County, and the Town and Hamlet, or place known (out of any Town or Hamlet)
whereof the party is or was, so that if there be diverse Hamlets in one Town,
he may be named of a place known, and if the place be within a Town, then he
must be named of the Town. 35. H. 6. 30. and if both the Town and the Parish
do bear one name, he may be named of the one, or of the other of them, but if
there be two Towns in one Parish then he ought to be named of the Town, and
not of the Parish. 5. Ed. 4. 129. 22. Ed. 4. 2. and 22. H. 6. 41.

Lamb. li. 4. page 490.
11. An indictment against A. the Parson of Dale is not good without naming of
the place of his abode, because he may lie at another place then where his
benefice lies. 25. Eliz. Cur. Rep. Crompton.

12. As for the Alias dictus Alias dictus.
which is often put in the addition, the use thereof is chiefly in writs
grounded upon specialties, and to make the writ and writing to agree, for (as
touching endictments) if the party be not well named, both for his name of
baptism, surname, mystery, or degree and place, at the first, then cannot the
alias dictus make that good, which was not good before.

13. And it appears (1. Ed. 4. 2. and 2. Ed. 4. 16.) that the addition of the
degree or mystery must always be such as the party has at the very time of
the indictment, but the addition of the place may be of such place where he was
at any time before dwelling, so as the word nuper be used with it.

14. Furthermore the indictment must contain the day, year and place, The
year, day and place.
in which the offense was committed. 8. Ed. 4. 8. 2. H. 7. 7. and 25. Ed. 3.
43. and therefore if the indictment suppose it the X. day of March without any
more that is not good, but if it be the X. of March last past without showing
in what year, that is good enough, for the certainty may be found out by the
style of the Sessions, so if it be the tenth day from Easter anno 4. Caroli
that is good, likewise if it be in the Vtas of the holy Trinity, for it shall be
there understood to be the very day of the Vtas, viz. the 8. day after the
Feast and not quarto die after the Vtas, but if it be in festo sancti Petri it
is not good, because there be diverse Feasts of Saint Peter and none without
addition, says 3. H. 7. Fitz. Indictments 22.

Lamb. li. 4. page 491.
15. If the indictment be, that A. struck B. 19. die Maij anno regis nunc
quarto, whereof B. languished until the xx. day of the same month quo quidem
19. die, he dyed of the same stroke, this is faulty, because it ought to be
whereof he dyed the said xx. day, etc.

Lamb. li. 4. page 491.
16. If it be 29. die Februarij it is good enough in the bissextill (or Leap
year) which happens once in every four years, and which affords 29.
days to that month, but if it should be of a day and year which is not yet
come it is not good.

17. If it be Anno Domini 1599. the year shall be accounted after the
computation of the Church of England and not stilo novo, as it is now at Rome,
and other Countries abroad.

18. If the offense be done in the night before midnight, Lamb. li. 4. page 492.
the indictment shall suppose it to be done in the day before, and if it happen
after midnight, then it must say it must be done that day after, if it be in
festo of any Saint, it shall be construed to be in the very day of the Feast and
not in the Eve, but if the presentment be in the negative or in the affirmative
rising upon a negative, as that A. has not scowred such a Sewer, or that by
the not scowring thereof such meddowes be drowned, in these cases there needs
no year, nor day because it affirms a present evil. Mar.

19. But as a man may be too negligent in omitting, or in not hitting the time,
so also may he be over curious in doubling it without cause, for if he frame
the indictment, that A. stole certain goods such a day, and such another day,
that is not good; because one felony cannot be twice committed. 2. H. 7. 7.

20. But not only this certainety of time, but that of the place Place.
must be contained in the indictment, for it was adjudged (25. E. 3. 43) that a
man should not be put to answer to an indictment of killing the Kings Dear,
because there was no place named, in which the offense was done, so an
indictment supposing a felony to be done in such a place of such a County,
where in truth there is no such place in that County, is merely void by the
statutes 9. H. 5. c. 1, and 18. H. 6. ca. 12.

21. If a man being stricken in Midlesex had dyed thereof in Essex, the Books.
3. H. 7. 12. 4. H. 7. 18. 6. H. 7. 10. 7. H. 7. 8. 10. H. 7. 28. and 11. H. 4.
etc. did not agree, in which of these Countyes he should be indicted, but the
statute of 10. Car. ca. 19. takes order, that if the stroke or poisoning
happened to be in one County, and the death in another County, the indictment
in the County where the death is, shall be good, and likewise, that if a Murder,
or Felony be done in one County, and a man becomes accessory to it in another
County, the indictment against the Accessory shall be good in that County,
wherein he becomes accessory.

22. Where (by the way) you may see in plain words of this statute, that
Justices of the peace may take indictments of murder, as of murder, though
Master Fitz. fol. 17. denies it, saying, that they cannot enquire of murder,
saving only as of felony or manslaughter, but by the statute of 10. H. 7. ca
21. in Ireland murder of malice prepenced is made high Treason, and Justices of
peace by their Commission in Ireland may inquire of it as Treason, but they may
not proceed any further in it.

23. And you shall read of an indictment of murder (before them) recorded in 3.
H. 7. 5. agreeable whereunto was the opinion of Hales and Portman Justices, as
appears in a Report of Dallison Justice, and of the same mind also were the
Justices of the Kings Bench. Lamb. li. 4. page 493.
5. Ed. 6. Collections, Dyer fol. 69.

24. If a man be robbed by the highway in Midlesex and apprehend the Thief by
Huy and Cry in Essex, having the goods about him, now may the Thief be
indicted of felony in Essex, but not of robbery by the high way, for he is a
felon of those goods whersoever he be found with them, but he is no Robber by
the high way, save only in that County where the Robbery was committed, and
debet, (says Master Bract.) quisque jure subjacere ubi deliquit.

25. The certainety of the name of the person to whom the offense is done, is
also in most cases requisite, but yet if the indictment be, quod bona and
catalla cujusdam hominis ignoti felonice cepit, and quendam ignotum felonice
depredavit, it is good, because of the Kings advantage of forfeiture thereby,
Fitz. endictment 12. and by the opinion of Read and Fineux 12. H. 7. (reported
by Dyer 285.) an endictment of affray and assault, in quendam ignotum, is good
enough, because the party is at no mischief thereby, seeing that if he should
be afterward endicted of that offense by the very name of the person supposed
in the first indictment to be unknown, yet might he help it by taking
averment that it was the same and none other offense.

26. You may see an Endictment (Fitz. endictment 9.) quod Averberavit, D. and
xx. Iaccos pretij, etc. was thought sufficient, without showing to whom the
Iackes did belong: Whereat Master Stamford (fol. 95.) marvelleth, saying, that
he saw no cause why it should be good unless it were for that the matter could
not be made more certain; But peradventure certainety in Endictments was not
in those days thought so needful as now it is holden, for at this day such an
endictment will be void.

27. If the goods of a Parson of a Church be taken, the indictment must be bona
Rectoris and not Ecclesiae, and if the goods of the Church, then Parochianorum,
in custodia gardianorum, and not bona Ecclesiae. 37. H. 6. 30. If they be the
goods of a Mayor and Commonalty, and the Mayor dies before the Endictment,
then it shall be bona communitatis, says Mar. but enquire of that, because they
have no such name of Corporation.

28. If the Endictment be, quod A. verberavit B. and unum equum precij xx.s.
felonice cepit, and does not say, ipsius B. yet it is good enough, 30. H. 6.
Fitz. Endict. 9. but at this day such endictment is void, or if it be quod unum
equum predict. I. cepit, and there were no mention of I. before, then it is
likewise void. 9. Ed. 4. 1.

29. If the goods of a man be taken and he makes Executors and dies, the
Endictment shall be bona testatoris: but if they were taken after his death, it
shall be bona testatoris in custodia executorum existentia: If the Endictment
be quod A. furatus est tunicam hominis ignoti quem invenit mortuum, that is not
good. 11. R. 2. Fitz. Endictment 15. If a man take away a coat, armor, which
hangs over a Tomb in a Church, the Endictment shall say, bona executoris, of
him whose Tomb it is: But if a grave stone be taken away the Endictment shall
be bona Ecclesiae, Mar. If my goods be taken by a Trespassor, and another
takes them from him the Endictment shall be bona of him which had the last
possession.

30. But if I bail goods to one from whom they be robbed, then it shall be
bona of me in his keeping, Mar. If an endictment be bona capellae in custodia,
etc. or bona domus, or Ecclesiae tempore vacationis, it is good. 7. Ed. 4. 14.

31. The name (and value) of the thing The name and the value of the thing.
in which the offense is committed, ought also to be comprised in the
Endictment, for an Endictment of the taking bona and Catalla, whether it be in
Trespass or Felony, is not good, for the uncertainety what goods they be,
Lamb. li. 4. page 496.
and if it be of dead things, it may be bona and catalla, expressing the names
thereof in certainety, but if it be of things living, it shall not say, bona
and catalla but equum, bovem, ovem, etc.

32. Again, the value (or price) of the thing is commonly to be declared in
felony, to make it appear from petite Larceny and in Trespass, to aggravate
the fault and fine: But yet an Endictment of the taking of beasts ferae naturae
as Dear, Hares, Patridges, or Phesants, is not good, unless they be taken in
a Park or Warren, that be liberties. 8. Ed. 4. 5. So of Charters, because
their value cannot be esteemed.

33. In all cases (says Master Mar.) where the number ought to be expressed
in the Endictment, there also it must be said, pretij, Pretij, and not ad
valentiam, etc.
or ad valentiam: as if it be of the taking of Doves in a Dove house, Lamb. li.
4. page 497.
or young hawks in a wood, and where it is of a living thing or things, it
must be pretij: and so of a dead thing in the singular number, but if it be of
dead things in the plural number, then must it be ad valentiam, and not
precij, again, if it be of a dead thing that goes by weight or measure, the
form is to say pretij and not ad valentiam.

34. If the Endictment be of taking away Coin, which is not current, it shall
say, pretij: otherwise it is of money current, Lamb. li. 4. page 497.
because that carries his value and price with it; If it be quod proditorie
fecit grossos, vel denarios, it shall be ad valentiam, and it shall not say,
20. libras in denarijs, or in pecunia Domini Regis, but ad instar pecuniae
Domini Regis, Mar.

35. Sundry other dainty and nice differences does Master Mar. make, where a
man shall say pretij and where ad valentiam, binding the Endictment to that
rule which the Register takes for the Original writs of Trespass: but
forasmuch as Nele 9. Ed. 4. 26. says, that Endictments be not tied to that
form, and because that rule of the Register is not very constantly observed in
Trespass it self, as a thing not material, in the opinion of Fitzh. in his
Not. Br. fol. 88. I thought it best to make choice of these (that I have) for
public use, and to leave the rest for private learning.

The manner of the fact and nature of the offense.
36. To the further certainety of the Endictment, the very manner of the fact it
self, and the nature of the offense, ought to be mentioned also: for if the
Endictment be, quod A. captum profelonia, felonice and voluntary ad largumire
permisit, this lacks the certainety for what felony he was taken, and is
thereby void. 8. Ed. 4. 3. And so if the Endictment be, quod felonice fregit
prisonam apud A. and do not show for what felony he was imprisoned there; So
if it be that a man made a hundred shillings of Alchimy ad instar pecuniae
Domini Regis, and do not show like to what money, as groats, or shillings,
etc. it is void, Fitzh. Endict. 10. And therefore, in murder, or manslaughter,
it does well to express the stroke whereof the death ensued, Collection, Dyer
96.

37. If the Endictment be, that A. spoke such words against the King, Lamb. li.
4. page 498.
and lay them down in certain, vel his similia, it is void for the
incertainety, Brook action sur le case 112. And if it be, that A. and B.
manuforti intraverunt in tenementum, etc. that also is insufficient for the
like incertainety: because the word tenementum may as well extend to a house or
cottage, as to land, meadow, pasture, etc. Dallison.

38. So if the Endictment run thus: Apud C. in Comitat. predict. insultum
fecit, and ipsum cum quodam cultello pretij, etc. felonice percussit, and ex
malitia sua praecogitata murdravit: it is not sufficient, without showing the
place where he murdered him, which may be in some other place then where he
assaulted him, Collect. Dyer 69. And an Endictment of selling tanned leather,
was disliked. 1. Ric. 3. 1. because it neither contained the place where, nor
the person to whom the leather was sold, both which be material and
traversable.

39. If the Endictment be, that a man is a common Thief, without showing
especially in what thing, it is nothing worth. 22. lib. Ass. Pl. 75. and 29.
45. And so if it be of a general extortion against an Ordinary, without
showing in what, by 25. Ed. 3. Stat. 3. ca. 9. And so also if the Endictment
stand upon these Terms only, Insidiatores viarum, and depopulatores agrorum,
by 4. Hen. 4. cap. 2. And thereupon the Court said in 17. Ed. 4. 4. that upon
such an Endictment, the party shall be dismissed. Howbeit the Commission of the
peace has the words, Insidijs jacuerint, but it goes further, ad gentem
nostram mayhemandam.

40. Neither is it good in an Endictment against an Accessory to say, that he
received the goods without saying that he received the felon. 27. lib. Ass. Pl.
69. 9. H. 4. 1. and 25. Ed. 3. 39. nor to say, that he scienter felonem Domini
Regis apud A. recepit, without showing what felony he committed. 7. H. 6. 65.
nor without saying that he, (knowing it) received him feloniously. 7. H. 6. ca.
2. unless he receive one that is attainted of felony in the same County, for
then he must at his peril take knowledge of the attainder, and so no such
mention of knowledge needs to be used as it is holden. 8. Ed. 4. 3.
notwithstanding that opinion I think that it is necessary that the accessory
re verae have notice of the felony.

41. And if such an Edictment be, Sciens ipsos 4. homines feloniam, etc.
fecisse, apud D. felonice recepit, it is not good for that it shows not which
of them he received. 30. H. 6. 2. and yet, if four be endicted jointly, then
are they also each one severally endicted thereby. 6. Ed. 4. 5. per Markham.

42. Concerning the nature of the offense, Nature of the offense.
it is to be observed that in an indictment of Treason (presentable before the
Justices of peace) the word proditorie ought to be used: In the Endictment of
Murder, murdravit is necessary. 9. Ed. 4. 26. and that word alone implies, ex
malitia praecogitata, Collection Dyer 69. But if without murdravit, it be, quod
A. occidit B. ex malitia praecogitata and voluntary, it is not enough, because
one man may kill another, so in a wager of battle, and yet be no murderer. And
for the same reason, if it be of Manslaughter, it must be felonice.

43. An Endictment was that the son had taken the sick Father, and carried him
into the cold weather, whereof he dyed, but it was disallowed because it lacked
felonice, Fitz. Endict. 3. Again, if the Endictment be of Burglary, then it
must be Burglariter, or ea intention ad feloniam sive murdrum faciendum, for
it is not enough to say, felonice fregit domum mansionalem in nocte: And if it
be of Rape, then it must say, felonice rapuit, for (without rapuit) it
suffices not to say, felonice cepit Aliciam and eam carnaliter cognovit. 9.
Ed. 4. 27. and 11. H. 4. 12.

44. If it be furatus est, it seems to Mar. to be good, without the word
felonice, but 18. Ed. 4. fo. 10. is against him.

45. If it be felonice abduxit unum equum, it is not of value without saying,
cepit: neither is cepit good alone, without abduxit, Fitz. End. 4. And if it be
felonice succidit arbores and illas asportavit, or vi et armis succidit arbores
et felonice asportavit, neither of them will make it felony, because the Trees
be a part of the Freehold, whereof no felony can be committed. 12. lib. Ass. pl.
32. But if it be vi et armis succidit arbores et eas felonice (at another day
after) cepit et asportavit, that will make it felony, as I have said already,
and if the Endictment be of petit Larce^ny it ought to have felonice in it. 27.
H. 8. 27.

46. And albeit the Endictment be but of a Maiheme, it must say, felonice
maihemavit, and yet Maihem is no felony but an heinous and (as it were) a
felonious Trespass. But where in an Endictment of felony, the word felonice
wants, there the Endictment may nevertheless stand good to make a Trespass.
7. H. 7. 7. 6. H. 7. 4. and 18. Ed. 4. 10.

47. And in an Endictment of Trespass or felony, the words contra pacem, and
the words, vi et armis (viz.) cum baculis, cultellis, Stamf. fo. 98.
etc. must of necessity be used, for the statute of 37. H. 8. ca. 8. in England
which makes the Endictment good, without those words is not of force in
Ireland.

48. If the Endictment be of forceible Entry, then the words vi and armis be
needless, because they are necessarily employed in the word force Mar. And if
the Endictment be founded upon a statute, it ought to say, contra formam
statuti, in hujusmodi casu provisi, ac editi: or where many statutes do
concern one offense, as in the case of Liveries and such like, contra formam
diver sorum statutorum without special naming of any, and then the best shall
be taken for the King, but an Endictment of a Riot, without saying, contra
formam statuti, etc. is not good, Lamb. li. 4. page 502.
because it is no Riot, but by that statute. And yet, it is not of necessity,
that the statute be verbally rehearsed, but only that the offense against the
statute be sufficiently and with full words described, Comment. 1. and 79.

49. In the twentieth year of Queen Elizabeth a man was endicted upon the
statutes. 1. El. cap. 1. and 13. El. cap. 2. in England, for ayding another
knowing him to be a principal mainteyner of the authority of the Sea of Rome
contra formam statutorum praedictorum: but because the Endictment wanted
certain material words (expressly mentioned in the Acts) viz. upon purpose,
and to the intent to set forth and extol the authority, etc. the endictment
was thought insufficient by the greater part of the Justices (assembled for
that purpose) notwithstanding the words, contra formam statutorum praedictorum,
were therein contained, Collection Dyer 363.

50. Again, it is not safe to recite the days or places, of the beginnings,
continuances, prerogations, or dissolutions of the Parliaments, least by
(mistaking of any of them) the whole Endictment fall to the ground thereby,
Ibid. 203.

51. Thus far of these points by way of short rule and direction, for the
better imitation and practice whereof, you may use the help of such forms of
Endictments as the Appendix at the end of this work will afford you. Now let
us with a few words consider what Endictments be receiveable by the Justices of
peace, and what ought to be rejected by them.

Endictments to be received or rejected.
52. Generally they may receive Endictments before themselves of all causes
being either within their Commission, or within the statutes whereof they have
to enquire. And they may also receive Endictments taken before the Sheriff in
his Turn, so that the Turn be holden within the month after Easter, or
within the month after Michaelmas, and so that those Endictments or
presentiments be indented and sealed between the Sheriff and the Jurors, and
so that they be made by the oath of xij. men at the least, and that those
Jurors be of good fame and legales homines, that may dispend yearly xx.s. of
freehold, or xxvj.s.viij.d. of copihold, W. 2. c. 14. 1. Ed. 3. ca. 17. 31. Ed.
3. ca. 14. 1. Ed. 4. ca. 2. and 1. R. 3. ca. 4. And for this purpose the said
statute. 1. Ed. 4. ca. 2. binds the Sheriff to certify to the Just. of Peace
at their next Sessions, the Endictments found in his Turn or Law day.

The duty of Justices about Endictments.
53. Thus much for the better assistance of our Justices of the peace, I thought
meet to say of Endictments not only because they be the chief bases, and
groundworke, whereupon the whole trial is afterward to be built and framed,
but also because the Justices (being Judges of the Court) ought of office to
see that the bills of Endictment have sufficient matter and form in them. 24.
Ed. 3. 74.

Of the impediments of proceeding upon Endictments before the Justices of
peace, and therewithal of the Certiorari to remove Records. CHAP. 9.
1. IT falls out not seldom, that when Justices of the peace have taken an
Endictment found before them, they cannot proceed to hearing and determining
upon it, either because their Commission or some statute whereupon it is
grounded gives unto them no further power, but only to enquire thereof: or
else because the Endictment is taken out of their hands by Certiorari, and
convayed to Justices of a higher authority, at the solicitation, and by the
means of some parties grieved, to the end that they may either traverse it
above, or there avoid it for insufficiency of form or matter.

2. Albeit that in the removing of Pleas, between party and party, from
inferior to higher Courts, by Tolt, Pond, recordare, etc. there was wont to be
a probable cause alleged, for which the same were removed: yet in this case of
the Crown there needs no cause to be comprised in the writ of Certiorari,
because they all be the Courts of the King, against whom the offense is
committed, and it breeds neither injury to the offender, nor loss to any
other person, in what Court soever the offense be tried.

3. This Certiorari then, may command either the Record it self, or tenorem
Recordi to be sent up, and it ought to be obeyed accordingly, for upon fail
thereof, first an Alias, then a Pluries, (vel causam nobis significes.) And
lastly an Attachment shall go out against them that should send it, as Master
Fitz. notes in his Not. Br. fol. 245. but they use at this day to impose a
fine upon Affidavit made of the delivery of the writ and refusal to certify.

4. And albeit the Certiorari be a Supersedeas of it self, yet may the party
upon the Certiorari purchased have a Supersedeas also, directed to the
Sheriff, commanding him that he arrest him not upon that Record before the
Justices of peace. Fitzh. ibid. fol. 237.

5. This writ of Certiorari is usually directed to the Justices of peace, Lamb.
li. 4. page 515.
and yet (as you have heard) the Custos Rotulorum only has the keeping of
these Records, but the ancient Commissions of the peace had no Custos Rotulorum
specially named in them, and then this certifying belonged to them all, but now
it belongs to the Custos Rotulorum.

6. Now, if a Certiorari come to the Justices of peace to remove an Endictment,
and the party sueth not to have it removed, but suffers it to lie still, then
the Justices of peace may proceed, notwithstanding the writ, as Hubbert the
Kings Attorney said in 6. H. 7. 16. For otherwise the trial of a Felon (if the
Endictment were of Felony) might be delayed and deluded also. But yet Keble
held opinion against him, and was fearful that in such a case it might prove
felony to make execution of the felon after such writ received: and (to say the
truth) the Justices ought of office to send it away, because the writ
contains in it self a commandment to them so to do.

7. And if a Certiorari come to the Justices of peace to remove an Endictment,
and in truth the Endictment was not taken till after the date of that
Certiorari: yet if the Endictment be removed thereby, it is good enough, for
that they both be the Kings Courts, 1. R. 3. 4. and in such case it is now
usual to remove it.

8. In the making of a Certificate The manner of the certificate.
upon this Certiorari, the Justices of the peace ought neither to omit that
which does authorize them, nor to exceed that authority which belongs unto
them: For on the one side, if they certify an Endictment of Felony, or of a
Riot (as taken coram Iusticiarijs ad pacem) it was not thought enough, without
saying further, Nec non ad diversa felonias, etc. and otherwise it was
doubtful whether the Endictee shall be quite dismissed or no, because the
Justices of the peace had then no Record at all remaining with them (for the
Clerk of the peace makes his Entry accordingly) and that Record which they
sent up is insufficient. And therefore the Clerk of the Crown was forbidden
to receive any such Certificate, 12. H. 7. 25.

9. On the other side, if they certify an Endictment of felony not determined,
into the Kings Bench, they ought not (without warrant) to certify another
Record of the acquittall of that Endictee for the same matter: for nothing
ought by them to be sent thither without warrant, but that which is Executorie,
and needs the help of that higher Court. 8. Ed. 4. 18.

10. And if a Certiorari be to send up the Endictment of A. in which Endictment
some others be indicted together with the same A. yet need not the Justices of
the peace to make certificate concerning any but A. 6. Ed. 4. 5. For although
they be named jointly, yet be they endicted severally, and the King may pardon
A. without forgiving the other, 6. E. 4. 5. Mark.

11. Again if the Endictment be of the stealing of two horses, and the
Certiorari speaks but of one horse: it seems that they need not to
certify it at all, because of the variance: for it is certain that they of
the Kings Bench will not arraigne the Endictee upon it: but will rather write
again to know, whether there be any Indictment that agrees with the writ, 3.
Lib. Ass. pl. 3. Cur.

12. Finally, it is noted (in 8. H. 5. fo. 5.) that Haukeford the chief
Justice of the Kings Bench observed this order, that he which brought thither
an Indictment (taken before Justices of the Peace) should endorce his name upon
the backside of it: which I note, not to teach them of the Kings Bench, but to
let the Justices of peace see, that there is some heed to be taken of him by
whom they send up their Endictments.

Of the sundry sorts of Process upon Endictments: and of the Supersedeas for
stay of them. CHAP. 10.
1. THe Court being thus made privy and possessed of causes must of duty
proceed to the handling (or hearing) and trial of them: the which, because it
cannot indifferently do, unless it keep one Ear for the offender, that he
also may be heard in his own discharge, as others were heard to lay the charge
upon him: the manner is (if he be absent) to award process against him, to
come in, and to make his answer.

2. But if he be present in Court, and confess the Indictment, then needs
there no Process at all: Lamb. li. 4. page 519.
for he shall be committed forthwith to prison, until that he has made his
Fine, or given sureties for it. 1. H. 7.

3. Commonly an Indictment or Information (being but an accusation or
declaration against a man) is of none other force, Process wherein it is named.
but only to put him to answer unto it. And hereof all Process has the name,
because it proceeds (or goes out) upon former matter, either original or
judicial.

4. The authority of making Process Authority to make out process.
upon indictments is given by express words in the Commission: and in other
cases (where it is not namely given) it is employed of congruence (or rather of
necessity) in the words (hear and determine) which cannot be performed,
unless the party either do come in gratis, or be brought in by the power of
Process.

5. This Process ought always to be in the name of the King, Lamb. li. 4.
page 420.
thus, Iacobus Dei gratia, etc. vicecomiti Dublin, etc. And therefore also
(seeing he is party) it must say non omittas propter aliquam libertatem, quin,
etc. Fitz. Prerog. 21.

6. And the Test thereof may be under the names of some two Justices, so that
it may be made sitting the Court in the Sessions, Test of the process.
Brook tit. Peace 6. and 7.

7. But now whereas the Commission gives to the present Justices authority to
make Process upon Indictments, New Co^missions of peace do not discontinue
the old process.
taken as well before former Justices as before themselves: all that doing was
wont to be discontinued in law, by the coming out of a new Commission of the
Peace, until that the statute 11. H. 6. ca. 6. did establish, that no pleas,
suits, or process (to be taken before Justices of the peace) should be
discontinued by a new Commission of the peace to be made: but that they should
stand in their strength, and that the Justices (assigned in the same new
Commission) should have power to continue the same, and to hear and determine
all that which depends upon them. And of the like effect there is a branch in
the later end of the statute of 10. Carol. ca. 14. in Ireland.

8. Furthermore, whereas Sheriffs (and their Bailiffes) used to arrest men,
Endictments before Sheriffs.
and to proceed upon Indictments found in their Turns or Law-dayes: another
statute (made 1. Ed. 4. cap. 2.) takes that power out of their hands, and
delivers it over to the Justices of the peace: appointing them to proceed
upon them, as if they had been found before themselves.

Process of utlary.
9. Now seeing that this Process of the Sessions is sent out to this end, that
either the party shall come in, to answer and to be justified by the Law, or
else that he shall (for his contumacy) be deprived of the benefit of law, (for
so much in effect do the words of the Commission, Quousque capiantur, reddant
se, aut utlagentur, import in them.) it follows that in all cases of
Indictments (if the party be returned insufficient) the process of Outlawrie,
lies against the offendour, if he be not taken before, or do not otherwise
offer and yield himself. And then the power of these Justices ends with the
Outlawrie: for they can make no Capias utlagatum, but must certify the
Outlawrie into the Kings Bench.

10. A good while after that Commissions of the peace were first awarded, there
was not given by them any power to make out any Process of Outlawrie: Lamb.
li. 4. page 422.
for by a Commission of the peace (in 20. E. 3. Parl. 1. Patent. in dorso.)
wherein were words authorizing the Commissioners to arrest all such as should
be endicted before them: but by and by this follows there, Et ad nomina eorum
qui fugerint and coram vobis justiciari noluerint, certificandum in
Cancellaria, etc. So that if they might not get them arrested, they could go
no further, but to certify their names only.

11. Now the mean to this Outlawrie is not all one in all cases: The general
process upon Endictments of Trespass.
for, upon Indictments of Trespasses against the P. or such other contempts the
Process is one; and upon Indictments of Treason (or felony) it is another.

12. Upon Indictments of Trespass against the peace, of Conspiracies, and of
Routs, in presence of the Justices, or in Affray of the people, if the
offenders may not be found, nor brought in by Attachment or distress (by
reason of their insufficiency) the process of Outlawrie is to be awarded by
the statutes, 18. Ed. 3. Stat. 1. and Stat. 2. cap. 5. The like is against such
as be indicted upon the statute of Liveries. 8. H. 7. cap. 4.

13. Upon the Indictment a Venire facias is to issue first, and then (if
thereupon he be returned sufficient) a Distringas, and upon the same process
of Distringas, infinite till he come in: but if a Nihil habet, etc. be at the
first returned against him, then a Capias Alias and Pluries, and after an
Exigent (as it seems by M. Marrow.) and by the old precedents these are the
ordinary process upon all Endictments (not sounding in felony, or greater
offenses) whether they be of Trespass against the peace, or of contempts
against penal Laws, unless it be otherwise specially provided by those same
statutes whereupon such Endictments be altogether grounded. And of this sort
these be.

14. The statutes of Laborers (23. H. 6. ca. 13.) gave (after the Endictments
grounded thereupon) an attachment, Capias, and Exigent. Fitz. Na. Br. fo.
(...). b.


15. But if the Endictment be in one County, and the Endictee be named to be
(then or nuper) dwelling in any other County, there is a special course of
process in that behalf for his benefit, appointed by the stat. 8. H. 6. ca.
10. both for Treason, Felony, and Trespass.

16. For (before any Exigent shall be awarded) one Capias must be sent out and
returned: Lamb. li. 4. page 525.
and then a second Capias shall go (into the County where he is supposed in
the Endictment to be, or to have been conversant) returneable before the same
Justices of the peace before whom the Endictment was taken three months at the
least after the date thereof (for all Counties be now holden from month to
month) by which last writ the Sheriff shall be commanded to take the
Endictee, if he may be found within his Bailiwicke, and if not, then to make
Proclamation in two Countyes (before the return of that writ) that the
Endictee shall appear before the said Justices of the said County (where the
Endictment was taken) at the day contained in the last Capias, to answer to
his offense, at which day if he come not, then the Exigent shall be awarded
against him and otherwise not.

17. And by the equity of this statute of 8. H. 6. ca. 10. Lamb. li. 4. page
526.
(says Master Mar.) if the Endictee be imprisoned in another County, the
Justices of peace may award an habeas corpus to remove him before them.

18. But if it be mentioned in the Endictment that the Endictee is dwelling in
another County, Ibid.
by the Alias dictus only then it is out of the case of that statute. 8. H. 6.
because the Alias dictus is not to be traversed. 1. Ed. 4. 1.

19. But yet you must presuppose, that all this process of outlary may be
stayed by a Supersedeas. Supersedeas to stay process*
And Master Fitz. (in his N.B.f. 137.) has the case, that if an Exigent go
out upon an Endictment of Trespass (found before Just. of the peace) the party
may find sureties in the Chancery (body for body) to appear at the day of the
writ, and may then also have a Supersedeas from thence to the Sheriff,
commanding him to forbear to take him, and to let him go if he then have
already taken him for that cause. And again you may see in the new book of
Entries (fol. 546.) the process upon such an Endictment stayed by a
Supersedeas issuing from one Justice of the peace alone, and testifying that
the party came before him, and found surety de fine assidendo. But as I believe
the former, so will I not persuade the practice of the latter: because I think
it not in the lawful power of any one Justice of the peace to award any such
warrant, but that it must be done by two Justices at the least (the one being
of the Quorum also) as the Commission now stands.

20. I have yet to speak of process upon Endictments of Felonies, Process
upon Endictments of Treasons and felonies, etc.
wherein I will be short, that I may pass over to other things.

21. It seems by Master Mar. that the process at the common Law upon
Endictments of felony, was but one Capias, and then the Exigent: For so it was
upon an Endictment of death, Lib. Ass. 22. pl. 81. and Stamf. 67. But the old
presidents (grounding themselves upon the statute. 25. Ed. 3. ca. 14.) do use
the mention of two writs of Capias before the Exigent. For that statute
provideth that after return of non est inventus, upon the first Capias,
another Capias shall be incontinently awarded, where by the Sheriff shall be
commanded to seize the Cattels of the Endictee, and safely to keep them till
the day of the Capias returned, and if he then also return non est inventus
and the Endictee comes not in, the Exigent shall be awarded, and the cattle
shall be forfeited: but if he come and yield him to be taken, before the return
of the second Capias, then the goods and Chattels shall be saved unto him.

Process into foreign shires.
22. And here also the Just. of P. have power to send into a foreign County,
for, whereas by the common Law, no man could be attached upon an Endictment, or
utlary of felony, but only in the County wherein he was endicted or outlawed,
whereby many evil men were much encouraged, the statute. 5. Ed. 3. ca. 11. did
take order that Just. (assigned to hear and determine felonies) might direct
their writs to any County in England, to take such Endictees whithersoever they
were removed.

23. On the other side if the Endictment be found in one County and the
Endictee is therein named to be then dwelling in another County: I have told
you already (in this chapter) what process belongs to it, and therefore I
will proceed to Process upon informations.

24. The power of proceeding and making process upon Informations Process
upon Informations.
proceeds from special statutes, and may not therefore vary from their
direction, although they themselves do vary greatly one from another.

25. For upon an Information given for the King before Justices of the peace,
upon the statute of Liveries Liveries.
(made 8. Ed 4. ca. 2.) they shall award such process as is made upon an
Original writ of Trespass done against the Kings peace, because the
Information it self is (by force of that statute) in stead of an original
writ, and likewise upon all other Informations the process must be as the
statutes whereupon they are grounded do direct.

Of hearing upon Confession. CHAP. 11.
1. THe party being thus brought in, (or otherwise yielding himself) to
answer, Justice requires that he be heard to speak, for himself, and
therefore he may (as his case will serve) either confess or deny the offense
wherewith he is burdened.

2. And this confession is of two sorts, free, or forced, and that former is of
two kinds also, absolute, or after a manner.

3. In the free and open (or absolute) Confession Free Confession.
he takes the fault upon him, and yields himself simply to such pain as
the Court will inflict for it.

4. And this free confession is of great force in the Law: for if it be upon an
Endictment of Battery, and (after such confession had for the King) the party
beaten will also bring his action of Trespass for his own damage, then shall
the defendant be concluded by his former confession upon the Endictment, so
that he shall not be received to say the contrary. 9. H. 4. 8. and 11. H. 4. 65.

5. But the other (which I call confession after a manner) is only a not
denying, in which the party does cunningly, and (after a sort) take the fault
upon him, without plainly confessing himself guilty thereof: as where he
puts himself in gratiam Regis, and petit admitti per finem, without any
more, sometime (by protestation that he is not guilty) pleads his pardon, and
such a confession (if I may so call it) does not so conclude him, but that he
may afterward plead not guilty in any action brought against him. 9. H. 6. 60.
Cur. and 11. H. 4. 65.

6. But here it is good to learn, whether the Justices be compellable to admit
such a confession by a manner, being altogether devised in favor of offenders,
and for deceiving of the King, or whether they may drive the party either to an
absolute confession (for increase of the Fine) or to his Traverse, that
(failing therein) he may be imprisoned, and fined also.

7. The forced confession whereof I spoke, is that which the Justices do draw
out of the party by the examination of himself, in such cases wherein that
examination is permitted.

Of hearing by Discretion. CHAP. 12.
1. Whether the offender shall freely confess the fault, Denial of the
offense tried. Lamb. li. 4. page 531.
or finally yield himself to Grace, or plead his pardon without confessing it,
yet then is this matter fully heard, and the Court made ready to determine of
it, but if he shall deny the fact, then must some other course of hearing (or
trial) be taken for it.

2. And that is in some cases by discretion of the Justices: in some other
cases by examination of the parties, or witnesses: and in some other cases by
certificate of other men, Ibid.
but in most cases by Traverse or arraignement, both which last trials are
performed by the verdict of xij. men.

Lamb. li. 4. page 532.
3. For Justices of the peace cannot (upon an Endictment of mayhem) make the
trial by their own view or inspection, as the Justices of the Kings Bench may
do, says Mar.

Ibid.
4. The trial of offenses ought for the most part to proceed either after the
general order of the common Law, or upon such special examination (or other
proof) as some statutes do give in special cases, and this hearing at
liberty and discretion, has seldom any place.

5. But wheresoever it is permitted, that counsel which Master Bract. li. 1.
gives, is to be harkened unto: Lamb. li. 4. page 533.
In judicial hearing (says he) besides the body of the fact it self, these
seven circumstances are to be weighed, namely the cause, the person, the time,
the place, the quantity, the quality, and the event.

Ibid.
6. And for proof, that hearing by discretion, is yet in some sort suffered,
take this for example.

Ibid.
7. The Justices of peace may hear by their discretion, as well by examination
as otherwise, at the suit of the King or of the party, the offenses done
against the statute provided for the true making of tyle. 17. Ed. 4. ca. 4.

Ibid.
8. But how far this discretion, and the word otherwise may be extended, in
this and such like cases it cannot well be foretold, for it is referred unto
them, and they must take counsel, ex re and ex tempore, for it.

Of hearing (or Trial) upon Examination. CHAP. 13.
1. THe obstinacy of evil doers, that would show no conscience in
acknowledging of their faults, and the corruption of Jurors that would present
nothing that lay only in their own knowledges, have begotten and brought into
our Law, this trial by examination wherewith it was not before acquainted.

2. And yet, this manner of trial is not loosely permitted to Justices of the
peace, but in cases only, where either the statutes do generally refer the
trial to their discretions, or else do specially authorize them to take the
Examinations.

3. The examination then is sometimes of the offenders themselves, sometimes of
witnesses that can speak to the matter, and sometimes both of the parties and
witnesses: of every of which I will give you an authority, or twain, and leave
the rest to your own reading and examination.

4. Upon appearance (after process) against the offenders of the statutes of
Liveries, the Justices of peace may examine them, and thereupon convince them,
so as if they were thereof convict by enquest. 8. H. 6. ca. 4. and 8. Ed. 4.
ca. 2.

5. And because it is often seen, that those which have committed an offense,
will also increase their fault by denying the same, therefore some statutes do
appoint that the Just. of the P. shall take the examination of others,
Examination of others.
besides the offenders themselves.

6. Now whereas also some statutes do enable the Justices of peace to hear
and determine, by the general word Examination, without showing what persons
they shall examine: It seems to me that they may thereupon examine, as well
the parties, as other witnesses.

7. Thus far of examinations, which whether they ought to be taken upon oath
or no, where the oath is not namely given you may easily Judge by that which I
have already said thereof in the first book, and yet (for your further
resolution) I say now, that these examinations of witnesses ought always to be
taken upon oath, the rather because the trial hereof depends upon them.

Of hearing (or Trial) by Traverse. CHAP. 14.
1. THe most solemn and ancient trial of the fact against an offender that
will not confess it, is that which we see performed by the verdict of 12. good
and lawful men of the Country, and it does also best content and quiet the
guilty man, for that it passes by his own Countrymen, Neighbors and Peers,
according to the ancient liberty of the land, whereunto every Freeborn man
thinks himself inheritable.

2. And thereupon it is named in Mag. Chart. cap. 29. Legale judicium parium
suorum, the lawful judgment of a man's own Peers, or Equals, because as the
nobility, so also the Commonalty are to be tried, in treason, felony or
misprision of treason, not the one by the other, but each by men of their own
estate and calling: I mean by the word Nobility, as our own law speaks
(which calls none Noble under the degree of a Baron) and not as men of
foreign Countries do use to speak, with whom every man of gentle birth is
accounted noble: For we daily see, that both Gentlemen and Knights do serve
in the Parliament as members of the Commonaltie.

3. Howbeit in cases of forceible Entry, riot, rout, Lamb. li. 4. f. 539.
unlawful assembly, or such like, they of the Nobility shall be tried by xij.
men even as other inferior subjects, 3. and 4. P. and M. reported by Dallison.

4. This Trial happens before Justices of the peace, sometimes upon
Traverse, and sometimes upon Arraignement.

4. But yet, some things be common to them both: for, if the party charged,
will demurre in law upon the Evidence, the Justices ought to record his
demurrer: so if he will plead (in justification) any matter of Record that is
before other Justices, they ought to give him day to bring it in, Mar. So
also, if the Justices (thinking an Endictment to be void) have discharged the
prisoner, paying his Fees, yet upon change of their opinion they may stay him
again, at any time before Judgment. Fitzh. Endict. 27.

5. But if he plead a pardon before them, in which certain persons be
excepted, and the Kings Attorney is not present to join issue, that he which
pleads it, is one of those that be excepted, then they themselves may supply
the office of the Attorney, in that behalf, 8. E. 4. 7.

The Kings advantage.
6. Whereupon also I gather this general learning, that they ought not to
suffer the King to be disadvantaged, where it lies lawfully in their power to
prevent it.

7. And if an Endictment be challenged, for such cause as these Just. will not
allow, then may they seal a Bill of that exception for the party if he will
write and require it according to the statute. W. 2. ca. 30. as M. Mar.
writes.

8. The Traverse took the name of the French de Traverses, which is none other
then de transverso in Latin, signifying on the other side: because as the
Endictment on the one side charge the party, so he on the other side comes
in to discharge himself: For whereas the arraignement proceeds upon him that
is unwillingly brought in by Process, the Traverse is (for the most part)
freely tendered by the party himself.

9. To Traverse Traverse.
an Indictment then is to take issue upon the chief matter thereof, which is
none other to say, then to make contradiction or to deny the point of the
Indictment. As in a presentment against A. for a high way overflowne with water
for default of scowring a ditch, which he and they (whose estate he has in
certain land there) have used to scowre or cleanse: A. may traverse either the
matter ( viz. that there is no highway there) or that the ditch is
sufficiently scowred: or otherwise he may traverse the cause, viz. that he has
not that land, etc. or that he and they (whose estate, etc. have not used to
scowre the ditch. 5. H. 7. 3.

10. And this liberty of Traverse is commonly restrained to an Endictment of
Trespasses, contempts, Riots, etc. and other inferior offenses within the
Commission or statutes, authorizing the Justices of peace, and is not usually
extended to Treasons, or felonies, as you shall hereafter see.

11. And there is no doubt, but that as Justices of the peace have power to
award Process, the parties also have liberty to speak for themselves: and
(having spoken) the Justices may hear and determine of their speech, whether
it touch them in Freehold or otherwise.

12. For although it be holden ( 2. R. 3. 11. 19. H. 8. 11. and Fitz. tit. Ass.
442. and in other books) that a man shall not be received to traverse a
presentment, unless it do charge him in his Freehold: yet Hussy and Fairefax
said (in 5. H. 7. 4.) that a presentment (not concerning freehold) which is
found before Justices of the peace may be traversed: For if process be
awarded, the party may come in, and offer his Traverse, or otherwise the
process should be in vain.

13. Hereunto agrees Moubray (41. Ed. 3. 26.) saying further, that in a Leet
such a presentment is not traversable, because out of a Leet no process can be
awarded upon it. And this peradventure is the reason of the book ( 8. Ed. 4.
5. and of M. Marrow.) where they say, that a presentment of bloodshed found in
the Sheriffs Turn, and sent (as it ought to be) to the Justices of the peace,
cannot be traversed before them; as whereupon they can neither make process, nor
discharge the party by way of plea.

14. So that this seems to be a general learning that wheresoever any
process ad respondendum goes out by force of such an Indictment as is
traversable, there also the party may offer, and ought to have his Traverse
against it.

15. But Mar. says, that if a man be of an Enquest that indicted him of
Trespass, or such like (so that upon the matter, he indicted himself) this
is so strong, that he shall never be received to traverse it.

16. It is not my meaning to pester this book with Presidents: But yet
forasmuch as in the record of one Traverse, there is at once discovered the
Style of the Sessions, the Indictment, the process to answer, the Traverse it
self, the verdict and Judgment thereupon, the process of execution, the
yielding of the parties, and the assessement of their Fynes, so that it alone
may serve in stead of all: I trust it shall not be troublesome to insert it,
and it is as follows:

Trial of felonies upon arraignement, and what Pleas, or other helps may be
used therein by the prisoners. CHAP. 15.
1. ARraignement and Traverse Difference between Traverse and arraignement.
Lamb. li. 4. page 546.
do not so much differ in the nature (or substance) of the Trial it self, as
in the order or usage of the same. For as there is no Endictment traverseable
by the party, but that he may also be arraigned upon it: so likewise is there
no Endictment whereupon the party may be arraigned, but that he may also (if
he will) tender his Traverse unto it.

2. The difference then stands in this, Lamb. li. 4. page 547.
that commonly he (which is to be arraigned) comes in by compulsion of bond,
or process, and is touched with matter concerning life and death, or some such
heinous offense, and pleads generally not guilty to the Endictment.

3. Commonly I say, because although he come in freely, Ibid.
and be indicted of some inferior offense, yet he may be nevertheless
arraigned: neither is he of necessity driven to plead not guilty (which runs
to the fact) but may (if the case will suffer) plead a justification, or matter
in Law, though it be in case of felony.

4. It seems to have borrowed the name out of the word Array, Ibid.
either of the panell, or Jury: because he that is arraigned must be tried by
them being first called, arrayed, sworn, and tried, in order for that service,
or else of the array of the prisoners, that be perused and arrayed in order
before they come to trial.

5. If I should here rip up, and prosecute at full (as the place offreth me
occasion) the whole learning that belongs the arraignement and trial of
Felons, as well for the taking of Challenge, and pleading of justification,
matter in Law, pardon, another time acquit, and another time attaint: as also
for the having of Sanctuary, and saving by Clergy; I should but actum agere,
and yet not do it half so well as you may find it in Master Stamford,
besides the which I should endeavor to teach them, of whom I my self may
better learn, seeing that for the most part the use of these matters is either
reserved till the coming of the grave Justices of Jail delivery or else is
performed by other men of Law that can inform themselves sufficiently therein.
Yet considering that these things do many times fall in use in the County of
Dublin, and that it were unseemely for Justices of the peace to be altogether
ignorant therein, I will shortly run over them, but first let me offer to your
consideration a point or twain, whereof it peculiarly behooves our Justices to
be advertised.

6. The first thing is, that there be sundry felonies, Felonies not tryable
before Just. of the P.
and some Endictments of felonies also the which (as it seems to me) Justices
of the peace cannot here, or try at all, the second is that in the handling of
those very felonies wherewith they may deal, there be yet certain
considerations peculiar to the Justices of the peace only, and not common to
them with other Judges.

7. Of that first is the felony for forgery, 28. El. ca. 4. in Ireland.
by the statute made in the xxviij. year of the Reign of the late Queen
Elizabeth ca. 4. in Ireland after conviction for a former offense.

8. Neither does the hearing and trial of that felony of a servant (taking the
goods of his Master after his death) belong (as I have said) to the Justices of
peace in the Country: Lamb. li. 4. page 548.
because they cannot take notice of his default in the Kings Bench by which
default it first begins to be felony. 33. H. 6. ca. 1. 33. H. 6. ca. 1.


9. The like, though for unlike reason, is to be said, of the felonies in
embezelling of any the Records of the Courts at Dublin against the statute.
Lamb. li. 4. page 549.
8. H. 6. ca. 12. And of an accessory in one County, where the felony was done
in another County, upon the statute of 10. Caroli ca. 19. in Ireland, because
the hearing and determining these felonies is not committed to the Justices of
peace, but remitted to other Judges by the very same statutes, nevertheless
Justices of peace by the words of that statute may inquire and proceed to take
that Endictment.

Ibid.
10. Furthermore, they cannot make trial of such as were indicted of felony
before the Coroners, or before the Justices of jail delivery, or of Oyer and
Terminer, if the same persons were not Just. of P. also in the same shire, so
as the indictment may be understood to be taken by them, as before Justices of
the peace: for their Commission and authority extends only to such as stand
endicted before themselves or before former Justices of the peace, or the
Sheriff in his Turn.

Things peculiar to Iu. of the peace in the trial of felonies.
11. Thus far of the first point, touching the second, it seems by Mar. and
Fitz. fol. 16. that albeit two Justices of the peace (the one of them being of
the Quorum) may in the County of Dublin hear and try felonies, yet no Justices
of the peace have authority to deliver felons by Proclamation, without
sufficient acquittall nor yet to deliver such as be in prison for suspicion of
felony, unless there be in the Commission a special clause, ad gaolam
deliberand. etc. as it is in the Commission for the County of Dublin.

12. For they must proceed by inquiring, hearing, and determining, as their
Commission appoints them, and not rid the jail otherwise, as the Justices of
Jail delivery may do; And therefore such persons (if they cannot be indicted)
must either remain the coming of the Justices of Jail delivery, or else
(being removed into the Kings Bench) they are either to be delivered thence
upon the writ de gestu et fama, as the old order was, or by such other means,
as they at this day do use therein.

13. These Justices of peace can take no Appeal of any approver, nor other,
before them. 2. H. 4. 19. and so it is clearly holden. 9. H. 4. 1. because
their Commission stretches not so far, but only to such felonies, as fall
out by enquiry before themselves, or their former fellow Justices, howsoever,
the book in 44. Ed. 3. 44. upon the statute. 5. Ed. 3. ca. 11. or the statute
(8. H. 6. ca. 10.) may seem (to a running Reader) to allow that power unto
them, and therefore Master Stamford fol. 95. doubts of it.

14. But howsoever that be, yet seems it to me no less reasonable then
serviceable, that if one felon will accuse another before Just. of the peace,
they may take his confession and reprive him and thereupon cause the other to
be inquired of, and so proceed against him by way of Indictment.

15. Furthermore they cannot arraigne a man upon his abjuration, says Mar.

16. It has also been thought unmeet, that they should try a felon the same
day, in which they awarded the venire facias, against the Jury. 22. Ed. 4. 44.
Fitz. Coron. tit. 44. but that has no necessity, and the Law is now otherwise
taken.

17. Mar. says that they cannot award the writ of venire facias tot matrones,
to try whether a woman (arraigned before them) be with child or no, but seeing
it stands with Law, and reason to stay her for the time (that the child may
be preserved) It must of necessity follow that this opinion of Marrow is
against the Law.

18. They may give Clergy to a felon if the Ordinary (or his Deputy) be present
to take him: but if they be absent, he must be reprived, because as Mar. says,
these Justices can set no Fine upon the ordinary for his absence: no more then
if he will accept one to read as a Clerk, where in truth he cannot read at
all, but if you look upon Master Stamford lib. 2. ca. 25. he will persuade
you, that the Ordinary is not the Judge but a Minister in the trial of Clergy:
and that Clergy may lawfully be given and allowed in his absence.

19. Of the Fine, for his default at these Sessions, Lamb* li. 4. page 55^.
I am a little doubtful, as I have said before, but touching the allowance of
Clergy to the offender, I see no cause at all why it may not belong to the
Just. of peace, as well as to other Judges: seeing that they be Judges of the
felony, as other Just. are.

20. Mar. says also, that if Bigamy had been alleged against one that prayed
his Clergy, the Just. of P. could not have written to the Ordinary to certify
the same, but this opinion seems to be no Law, for where Justices have power
to hear and determine, of congruity they have power to do all things
necessary to bring the cause to an end.

21. And if a man (outlawed of felony by process before the Justices of peace)
be brought before them, and do allege, that he was (at the time of the utlary
pronounced) out of the Realm in the Kings service under such a Captain: or
that he was then imprisoded in another County, they can neither write to the
Captain, nor into the County, by the opinion of Mar.

22. Thus much only of things restraining the Justices of peace in the trial
of Felonies, wherein they are not in Ireland at all occupied, saving only in
the County of Dublin, but the jail delivery is wholly left to the Justices of
Assize.

23. These things thus premised, Let us now suppose all impediments to be
removed, and set we the felon at the bar, ready to take whatsoever lawful
advantage of Challenge, plea, or other benefit, that may be allowed unto him.

24. It was ever permitted, Challenge.
that the prisoner might challenge so many of the Jury as he would (showing
lawful cause for it) as namely to say, that he (whom he challenges) was one
of the Jury which did indict him, for such a one it may be thought, he will not
falsify his former oath. 25. Ed. 3. cap. 3. or to say that he has not lands
of the clear yearly value of xl.s. for such a one is disabled. 2. H. 5. ca.
3. or to say that he is not probus or legalis, because he has been attainted
of felony, forgery, perjury, or of such like as are showed before.

11. Caroli ca. 9. in Ireland.
25. The common Law has also (in favor of life) allowed unto the prisoner his
peremptory challenge, without showing any cause at all for it. But yet
forasmuch as it was long time doubtful how many he might challenge, the same
is now put into certainety (by the statute. 11. Caroli ca. 9.) and restrained
to the number of xx. persons at the most.

26. Now if the trial be of an Alien borne (for felony or murder committed by
him) the Jury shall be de medietare lingua, that is, half of our Nation, and
half of strangers, except it be in the case of a Scot, whose Jury shall be
altogether English, as well because he speaks one language, as also for that
he is reputed a subject and not an Alien, Collection Dyer 304. and 357.

27. Thus shortly of challenge which is but dilatory, and to win time: and
therefore let us now hear what he may plead in chief as it were, and for the
safety of his life.

Another time acquit.
28. And if the prisoner have been at any time before lawfully acquitted of the
self same felony, or have been orderly attainted of any other Felony, he may
safely rest upon it, for as it is unreasonable, to draw a man's life into double
danger for one single offense: So is it also unprofitable, to condemn him that
is already attainted, Coron. Fitz. 132. and 28. Ed. 3. 90. And for the proof
of either of these his allegations, the Justices ought to allow unto him
convenient time for the bringing in of the Record of the Court where he was so
acquitted, or attainted, Coron. Fitz. 232.

29. But because each of these two points has his several consideration in
that which does remain, I also will henceforth handle them apart.

30. If the prisoner be now arraigned of a felony by the name of A.B (by which
name, as also by the name of A.C. he is well enough known) then may he say
that he was before time acquitted of the self same felony, before such or such
Justices, by the name of A.B. averring that he is the same person, and that he
is known by the one and the other name. Lib. Ass. 26. pl. 15. and 11. H. 4.
93. So, if he be arraigned of the murder of a man (supposed by the Endictment
to be slain in the thirteenth year of Queen Elizabeth's Reign) he may plead,
that he was acquitted of the murder of the same man, averring that he was
slain in some other year, Lib. Ass. 22. pl. 55. For as in the former case the
same man may bear two names: so in the latter, one person cannot be twice
killed.

31. But if the Felon were first acquitted upon an Endictment, which did not
comprehend sufficient matter of felony in it, that will not help him now
because his life was never put in jeopardy thereby; insomuch as if he had been
found guilty thereupon yet the Court would have delivered him, Stamford 106.
howbeit if the Endictment had good matter in it self then may no error
(committed in the process) take the benefit of this plea from him, seeing that
he was arraigned upon the Endictment, and not upon the process. 9. H. 4. and
Coron. Fitz. 444.

32. Again, if he that stole goods were acquitted in a County where he ought
not to have been tried for them, that is no lawful acquitall to save him from
trial now, no more then if a man were acquitted of murder in an appeal at the
suite of a younger brother during the life of the elder: that is of no such
force, but that he shall be arraigned at the suit of the K. again, Stamf. 105.
and. 106. and 1. H. 6. 31.

33. Lastly, he that is acquitted as principal to a Felony, may nevertheless
be arraigned as an Accessory (after the offense done) to the same felony,
because it is not the same, but another subsequent, and diverse offense, and yet
shall he never be arraigned as an Accessarie (before the offense) to the same
felony, because the Accessaries before the offense be the very causes of the
fact and do (as it were) inseparably concur with the principal, and be
present with him in doing of the same. Lib. Ass. 27. pl. 10. and Stamf. 105.

34. Now on the other side, Another time attainted.
since nothing can be had of him that is already attainted, and has thereby
lost whatsoever he might forfeit, it has always been thought meet to allow
him to plead it: and it is to no purpose to arraigne him of new, for that, or
for any other felony, except it be in a special case or two, for the benefit
of other persons which M. Stamford has briefly noted for us.

35. The first is for the advantage of the King: For if he that is attainted of
felony has also committed Treason, then may he be arraigned of the Treason,
notwithstanding the former attainder, to the End that his Majesty may have his
prerogative in the Escheat of all his lands of whatsoever other Lords they
shall be holden. 1. H. 6. 5. And yet if that Treason were committed after the
attainder for the felony, then (in the opinion of M. Stamf.) the title of
Escheat which by that attainder did accrue to the other Lords, cannot be
divested and taken from them by the subsequent treason.

36. The second is, for the commodity of subjects as in case where diverse men
be robbed of their goods by a felon, there, though he be attainted at the suite
of one, yet ought he also to be attainted at the suit of the rest, that each
of them may thereby have restitution of his goods, whereof otherwise for want
of suit he should be denied. Stamf. 165.

37. But now if he that was thus attainted, do afterward obtain pardon of
that felony whereof he was attainted, then he is restored to the law, and is
made answerable to all other felonies that were committed by him before the
time of that felony, whereupon his attainder was grounded. 6. H. 4. 68.

38. And if a man do commit two sundry felonies, and (being arraigned upon the
one) stands mute at the bar, and has therefore his judgment to be
pressed, yet may he be arraigned upon the other felony, notwithstanding the
former judgment: because it is none attainder at all for his offense wherewith
he was charged, but only a punishment inflicted by the Law upon his contumacie
and stubborn silence, Collect. Dyer 308.

39. With this there was wont to be matched the plea, That the prisoner was
another time convict Another time convict.
of felony, and delivered to the Ordinary to make his purgation: which also
was of equal force (with the former plea) to save him from new arraignement;
But the law of our time has worthily taken that plea from the offender, and
the offender himself from the power of the Church.

40. For as the allowance of the book proceeded from the pride of Churchmen:
Even so were those convicts ridiculously purged by them. For which cause the
statute of 11. Iacobi ca. 3. 11. Iacobi. c. 3. in Ireland.
has ordained that after allowance of Clergy and burning in the hand, the
prisoner shall be enlarged; Lamb. li. 4, page 553.
and not delivered to the ordinary, so that now as I conceive he may be put to
answer to all other Felonies whereof he is not before acquitted, convicted,
attainted or pardoned, and therefore leaving it, let us see how the offender
may be helped by pleading and praying allowance of the Kings pardon.

General pardon.
41. The pardon whereof the party may have advantage, is either general or
special: by general, I do here mean that which is given by parliament to
all men generally, or with the exception of some parties. And of this pardon
the Court ought of duty to give allowance, though the party neither plead it,
nor will accept the benefit of it. But if it make special exception of some
persons then must the prisoner allege that he is none of those that be
excepted, unless the Act it self do say, that he shall be helped by it
without any such pleading. 11. H. 4. 39. and Stamf. 103.

42. Touching this sort of pardon I will only lay down these few cases: the
servant that had killed his master was endicted of voluntary murder, without
the word proditorie, and was thereupon arraigned and found guilty. But because
the offense was petie Treason indeed, and petie Treason was then pardoned by
the Parliament (5. El.) though murder were therein excepted, Justice Welsh
thought it meet to reprive the same prisoner without giving Judgment upon him.
Coll. Dyer 235.

43. A man stroke another in February (13. El.) whereof he died in June next
following, in which mean while all felonies, offenses, Injuries, and
misdemeanors were pardoned by Parliament, and he was discharged by that pardon,
because the stroke was the offense against the Queen, and that was past and
pardoned, though the death did afterward ensue upon it. Com. 401.

44. One that had committed manslaughter, was endicted of murder, and thereupon
outlawed: afterward the Parliament pardons all offenses, etc. except persons
outlawed or attainted of murder: the party reverseth the outlawrie, and then
is arraigned of manslaughter: and it was much doubted whether he should be
discharged by the pardon, because the persons outlawed were excepted, whereas
if the offenses only had been excepted, it would have made no great question.
29. Eliz. Report. Crompton.

45. The special pardon Special pardon.
ought to be pleaded under the great seal, for that now in Ireland none has
authority to grant such pardons, but only the King.

46. And with this pardon, the party ought to bring a writ of allowance,
testifying that he has found sureties for his good report, according to the
statute. 10. Ed. 3. ca. 2. Howbeit that matter is many times dispensed withal,
by means of a non obstante, that may be put into the pardon, Com. 502. But let
us yet see, what the pardon has within it.

47. If the pardon do agree with the Endictment, as well in the name, surname,
and addition of the party, as also in the point of the offense that is to be
pardoned, then is there nothing to be said against it. But if the pardon be of
all Felonies, that will not discharge him of petit Treason nor murder, at this
day (except it contain them in special words) although before the statute.
13. R. 2. Stat. 2. ca. 1. such a pardon was availeable enough for them.

48. Neither is such a pardon sufficient to save the life of him that is
attainted of Felony, unless it have words to pardon the attainder, and
execution. 9. Ed. 4. 29. no more then a pardon of that attainder and execution,
will deliver him without words to pardon the felony it self. 8. H. 4. 21. So
where the party is abjured for the death of a man, the pardon must of necessity
carry words of abjuration, Coron. Fitz. 124.

49. And if the King do pardon to a Jailer the escape of prisoners being in
his ward for felony or Treason, that shall extend to negligent escapes only,
and to none other, Grants Fitz. 37. So if he pardon two men all felonies done
by them, or any of them, that will not serve them apart, because the first
words be joint and not several, whereas all felonies be of themselves
several. 22. E. 4. 7. For in all these, and the like cases howsoever the
favor of life may desire liberal interpretation, yet (forasmuch as the
offense is against Law) the grace and dispensation of the prince may not be
strained beyond the word.

50. The last helps for the prisoner, be Sanctuary and Clergy, Sanctuary and
Clergy.
whereas his case will afford him the one or the other of them, for if he were
taken out of Sanctuary, he ought to pray (at the first) to be restored: and if
he can read, he may (at any time) desire of the Judge the allowance of his
book.

51. How each of these began at the first and grew in time to be full summed,
or how they shronke again, (by one and one:) I may not here stand to
discourse, though it be a piece, worthy both the handling and hearing. But
forasmuch as our statutes do many times match these twain together, I will
likewise draw them forth, as I shall fall upon them, showing you where the one
or the other, or both be denied to the prisoner.

Once or more times.
52. Where Clergy lies, it is grantable but once to one person, except he be
within holy orders: for such a one may have it often. 4. H. 7. c. 13. and
Stamf. 135.

Bigamie.
53. Bigamus (that is to say, he which has been twice married, or which has
married a widow) may not have his Clergy at this day in Ireland, Dyer fo.
201. Stamf. fo. 134.
for in old time before the statute of 1. E. 6. ca. 12. it was a good
counterplea against it in England, and that statute of 1. Ed. 6. is not of
force in Ireland.

54. It was wont to be doubted, whether a Bastard Bastard.
might have the benefit of Clergy: because he could not be a Priest without
special dispensation, Brook Bastardie 46. but at this day Bastardy is no good
counterplea against Clergy.

55. And it was agreed by all the Justices (2. and 3. Phil. and Mar.) that a
woman Woman.
shall have none allowance of Clergy, but she may have (for once only) the
benefit of her belly, Lamb. li. 4. page 563.
if it be found by women thereto appointed that she is quick with child, Report
Dallison.

56. Conjurors or witches Witches, etc.
shall not have the benefit of Clergy. 28. El. ca. 3. in Ireland.

57. He shall have no Clergy that commits any felonious rape, Rape.
ravishment, or burglary. Burglary.
11. Iacobi ca. 3. in Ireland.

58. Nor he which commits the detestable sin of buggery. Buggery.
10. Caroli ca. 20. in Ireland.

59. There lies no Clergy nor Sanctuary for him which commits wilful
murder, Murder.
or poisoning Poisoning.
of malice prepensed; for these are high Treason in Ireland; or which robs
another in or nigh the highway; Rob in high way.
or which steals any horse or horses, Horse.
gelding or geldings, Mare or Mares, or steals goods out of any Church Church.
or Chapel, or which robs any person in any part of his dwelling house,
House.
himself, his wife, children or servants then being in or near the same. 11.
Iacobi ca. 3. in Ireland.

60. He which robs any person in any Booth or Tent, Rob Booth or Tent.
in any Fair o^ Market, the owner, his wife, children, or any servant then
being therein, either sleeping or awake is deprived of his Clergy. 11. Iacobi
ca. 3. in Ireland.

61. Sanctuary and Clergy be taken from him that secondly shall be convicted
of the forging of false deeds, Forgery.
etc. 28. El. cap. 4. in Irland.

62. In all other cases (so far as I yet find) the prisoner may enjoy the
privilege of Clergy: A consideration touching Clergy.
yea and in every of these statutes also that do resume Clergy, if so be that
the Endictment do not expressly mention the offense in the very words of the
statute it self the offendour may escape by his Clergy, for if the Endictment
be that he robbed one in the high way, and took ten shillings from his person
without showing that he made assault upon him, or used violence unto him, or if
it be of Burglary and do lack the word Burglariter: then as Master Stamford
warily notes, the offense is not against the statute, and consequently the
benefit of Clergy is not taken away from the offender, Stamford 130. Collect.
Dyer 183. and 124.

63. The same Master Stamford (about the same place of his book) moves a doubt
in this matter of Clergy, A scruple concerning Clergy.
when sundry of these statutes which take away Clergy (in case where the
offender is convicted by the verdict of twelve men) do speak nothing at all
of his attainder by utlary, or by Parliament, nor of his standing wilfully
mute, nor of his challenging above twenty peremptorily; nor of his refusal to
answer directly to the offense: It is to be considered (says he) whether in
these cases also the Clergy shall he denied unto him: But since Master
Stamfords time these doubts are cleared by the statutes of 11. Iacobi in
Ireland, cap. 3. where the Clergy is taken away in all these cases, except
utlagary upon an appeal, conviction by battle in appeal and attainder by
Parliament, which three cases are omitted in the said statute of 11. Iacobi. I
will now make an end of Trial and in the next place proceed to Judgment.

Of Judgment, and the several sorts thereof. CHAP. 16.
1. I Have formerly divided the offenses which are to be enquired of in the
general Sessions of the peace into five heads or parts that is to say
Treasons, Felonies, Misprisions, Praemunires, and finable offenses. And now I
shall proceed to declare the several Judgments that are to be given upon each
of those offenses in order as they are beforementioned.

2. There were at the common Law two kinds of Treason, that is, 10. H. 7. cap.
^1 in Ireland.
high Treason and pety Treason, but those offenses which at the common Law were
pety Treason (that is to say, a servant of malice prepensed to kill his or her
Master or Mistress, a Clerk of malice prepensed to kill his Ordinary, and a
wife of malice prepensed to kill her husband) are now in Ireland by the statute
of 10. H. 7. cap. 21. made high Treason, as if the same had been done to the
Kings person.

3. There be also two sorts of high Treason namely Treasons by the common Law,
and Treasons by several statute Laws.

4. The Judgment in high Treason Judgment in Treason.
by the common Law is that the offender shall be taken from the bar, and
returned to the prison where he was before, his irons there to be taken off,
and from thence to be drawn upon a hurdle to the place of execution, and there
to be hanged until he be half dead; then to be cut down alive, his intrails
to be taken out of his body and his privy members to be cut of, and burnt in
the fire before his face, his head to be cut from his body, and his body to be
divided into four quarters to be disposed of at the Kings pleasure. And this
is to be understood in all such cases of high Treason as concern the death or
destruction of the King, the Queen or the Prince; or the disherison of the
King of any of his kingdoms or government, or the levying of war, or the
deflouring of the Queen, or the eldest daughter of the King, or the wife of
the Prince, or the killing of the great officers of the King, as the
Chancellor, Stamf. fol. 182. and 32. 1. H. 7. fol. 24. 1. H. 6. fol. 5.
Treasurer, or Lord privy seal, or of any Judge being in the execution of his
office, or the Kings messenger, or such like, which trench to the overthrow or
diminishing of the Kings power or government, but in such cases wherein the
Treason does but only exalt it self upon some special prerogative of the King
to the deceit of the people, as coining of false and counterfeit money or such
like, there the Judgment against the offendour is to be taken from the bar
and returned to the prison from whence he came, his irons there to be taken
off, and from thence to be drawn upon a hurdle to the place of execution, and
thereto be hanged until he be dead, but if the offender be a woman, the
Judgment against her in all cases of Treason is to be burned.

Stamf. fol. 182. and ^2. 1. H. 6. fol. 5. 6. Eliz. Dyer fol. 230. the new
book of Entries, fol. 360.
5. Where offenses which at the common Law were not Treason are by any statute
Law enacted to be high Treason without any more saying, in such cases the
Judgment against the offenders shall be to be drawn and hanged, but where the
stat. says that the offense shall be Treason, as if it had been done against
the Kings person, or if the words be that the offenders shall suffer such
punishment as in cases of high Treason, then the offenders shall have Judgment
to be hanged drawn and quarterd.

6. Upon these differences it will follow that for breaking of prison by the
stat. de frangentibus prisonam made in Anno 1. Edw. 2. for counterfeiting the
Coin of an other Realm which is current in this Realm which is made Treason
by the statute of 4. H. 7. cap. 18. for washing, clipping, or filing of money
which is made Treason by the stat. of 3. H. 5. cap. 6. for Comricke, with by
the stat. of 18. H. 6. cap. 2. in Ireland; and for Sessing of horse or foot
upon the Kings subjects, which by the said stat. of 18. H. 6. are made Treason,
the Judgment against the offenders in all those cases is only to be drawn and
hanged.

7. But for Treason in stirring up the Irish or English to make war against
the King or his Deputy, or stirring up the Irish to make war upon the
English, which by the stat. of 10. H. 7. ca. 13. in Ireland is made Treason, or
for wilful burning of houses or ricks of Corn, which by the stat. of 13. H.
8. cap. 1. in Ireland is made Treason, and for wilful murder, which by the
stat. of 10. H. 7. cap. 21. in Ireland is likewise made Treason, the Judgment
against such offenders is to be hanged, drawn and quartered as in cases of
high Treason against the Kings person.

8. There be likewise two sorts of Felonies, that is to say, Felonies for which
the offender shall suffer death, and felonies for which the offender shall not
suffer death.

9. For the felonies of death the Judgment is alike in all cases, Judgment:
in Felony.
and as well for women as men, viz. to return from the bar to the prison from
whence they came, and there their irons to be taken off, and from thence to be
conveyed to the place of execution, and there to be hanged until they be dead.

10. For petty Larceny which is the stealing of goods under the value of twelve
pence privily, and not by way of burglary, or robbery, the Judgment is either
by whipping, or imprisonment, so often or so long time, as the Court in
discretion shall think fit, and if the offender be a woman and the felony
exceed twelve pence, and be under the value of 10. s. her Judgment is to be
burned in the hand, 10. Car. cap. 16. in Ireland.
and to be further punished by imprisonment, whipping, stocking, or sending to
the house of correction in such sort and for so long time (none exceeding the
space of one whole year) as the Court in discretion, according to the quality
of the offense, shall think fit.

11. Misprisions are of three sorts, viz. of Treason, of Felony, and other
great and exorbitant misdemeanors.

12. For Misprision of Treason the Judgment is that the offender shall forfeit
to the Kings Majesty all his goods, and chattels, Judgments in misprision.
and the profits of his land during his life, Stamf. fol. 38.
and to have perpetual imprisonment.

13. For Misprision of Felony the Judgment is, Fine, Ransom, 2. R. 3. 9.
and Imprisonment, at the discretion of the Court.

14. Stamf. fo. 38. 22. Ed. 3. fol. 13.
Other particular Misprisions have their particular Judgments, as for offering
to strike a Judge sitting in Judgment or a Iuror in presence of the Justices,
the Judgment is, that the offender shall forfeite his lands, goods, and
chattels, his right hand to be cut off, and to have perpetual imprisonment.

15. For one of base quality that shall strike a man of honor, Stamf. fo. 38.
Britton fol. 4^.
or a Knight, the Judgment in ancient time was the loss of his hand, but this
Judgment is not used at this day but in stead thereof fine and imprisonment
and bonds of the good behavior.

16. For rescueing of a prisoner arrested by any of the Kings Judges sitting in
Judgment, Stamf. fo. 38* 22 Ed. 3. fo. 13.
the Judgment is that the offender shall forfeit his lands, goods, and
chattels, and have perpetual imprisonment.

17. Judgment in Praemunire. 16. R. 2. ca. 5.
The Judgment against an offender in a Praemunire is to be out of the Kings
protection, and to forfeite his lands, goods, and chattels, and to be
imprisoned during the Kings pleasure.

18. Finable offenses are of several sorts, viz. some are offenses of force
and violence, some of fraud and deceit, some of omission, and diverse others of
several sorts, some by the common Law, and others by statute Laws, the
particulars whereof, and the several and particular Judgments that are to be
given upon each of them are before in the Articles of the Charge. ca. 4. and
likewise in a brief Roll added after the end of this book particularly
declared and set forth, and therefore it were needless to rehearse them here
again, but rather to refer the reader to that Chapter and to the Roll.

Of the process for the Fine of the King, and of the assessing, and estreating
thereof for the King. CHAP. 17.
1. SEeing that execution is but a performance of the Judgment I shall not
need to make long enumeration of the sorts of executions which are within the
power of the Justices of peace: For besides that by the knowledge of the one,
the other is known also, the Justices of the peace themselves have in many
cases performed their duty in both, when they have in the one pronounced that
which is due to the offender.

Execution for the King.
2. Howbeit, for as much as that which they are to do by way of execution,
offers profit either to the King or to his subjects: and that which
pertains to the King, is effected in this manner, viz. either by imprisonment
of the offender for the fine, or else by estreating the penalty and forfeiture
thereof into the Exchequer, from whence process is to issue for levying the
same. I will first bestow a few words upon the fine and estreats for the King,
and then speak of the benefit that belongs to the subject.

3. Where the Conviction is for Trespasses against the peace, Riots, and such
other contempts and offenses against the common Law or against some statutes,
for the which no certain Fine is appointed, there the Judgment is, that the
party shall be taken to satisfy the King for his fine: And thereupon, a Capias
pro fine, is to issue and (if the party cannot be found) other Judicial
process goes out till he be utlawed.

4. But if the party be brought in, then is he a prisoner, and then are the
Justices of peace (by their discretion) to assesse the Fine, and to commit him
to prison for the same, and thereof to make an estreate, and send it into the
Exchequer, that the Sheriff may be charged therewith upon his account.

5. For in no case can they of themselves levy any Fine or forfeiture due to
the King, insomuch as not they but the Sheriff is accountant for all such
matters.

6. The imprisonment Imprisonment.
that I speak of, is only to the end that the King may have the Fine, and
therefore upon the payment thereof, the offender ought to be delivered, Mar.
Br. Imprisonment 100.

7. Hereof also the Fine took first his name, of the Latin word finis,
because it makes an end with the King for the imprisonment laid upon the
offender, for the offense committed against his Law.

8. And in that respect chiefly does it differ from an amerciament: Difference
between Fine and Amerciament.
For when the offender has not so deeply trespassed, that thereby it
deserves any bodily punishment at all, as if he be non suit in an action or
do commit any such like fault, he is said to fall into the Kings mercy,
because he is therein mercifully to be dealt with.

9. And by magna carta (chap. 14.) that amerciament and sum of money which he
is to pay for the same, ought to be assessed and affeered by the good and
lawful men of the neighborhood, which also Glanvill lib. 9. ca. 11. affirms
to have been the Law of the land long before that time, saying, Misericordia
Domini Regis est quia quis per juramentum legalium hominum de vicineto eatenus
amerciandus est, ne aliquid de suo honorabili contenemento amittat.

10. But where the offense or contempt falls out to be so great, that it
asks the imprisonment of the body it self, and that during the Kings will
and pleasure then is the party to redeem his liberty with some portion of
money, as he can best agree with the King, or his Justices, for the same, which
composition is properly called his fine, or his ransom, and in Latin
Redemptio, as may be plainly seen by the statute of Marleb. 52. H. 3. cap. 1.
2. 3. and 4. and by the statute called Ragman, and diverse other ancient
statutes: Where (by the way) it seems by the propriety of the word redemptio
that the party offender ought first to be imprisoned, and then to be delivered
(or ransomed) in consideration of his fine.

11. Also whereas any statute speaks of fine and ransom both (as 38. Ed. 3.
ca. 9. and others do) it is taken that the ransom ought thereto beat the
least treble so much as the Fine, Dyer 232.

12. But now of later time, the Justices themselves have in some cases of
amerciaments also used to assesse and rate the same without any other help, as
where the officers of their Courts have offended. 33. H. 6. 54. 34. H. 6. 20.
and Lo. 5. Ed. 4. 5. which also seems to make an other difference between
the two words. But because neither of these be strictly observed, either in
common speech or in the understanding of the later statutes, I will no longer
stand upon it.

13. Now therefore, if the offense be fineable, Fine by discretion of the
Justices.
by general words only, without speaking of any fine, or without showing by
whom the fine shall be assessed (for so it is commonly in the elder statutes
that do prohibit any thing to be done) there the assessement thereof
belongs to the Justices before whom the conviction is lawfully had.

14. Again if it be fineable by these (or such like) words at the Kings
pleasure (as you shall find it in many statutes) then also the same Justices
(before whom the conviction was) shall assesse the fynes at their wills and
pleasures. For (say the books. 2. R. 3. 11. and 18. H. 8. 1.) the King (in all
such cases) utters his own will and pleasure by the mouths of the Justices.

15. And yet some statutes (using plainer speech) do namely refer the fine
to the discretion of the Justices of peace.

16. For they may (upon conviction had before them) set fine by their
discretion upon such as take Salmons, or destroy the fry of fish in Rivers,
against the statutes W. 2. cap. 47. 13. R. 2. cap. 19. and 17. R. 2. ca. 9.

17. And in these cases (even as in cases of amerciaments) the Just. ought to
take heed that the fynes be reasonable and just, having regard to the nature
and quality of the offense, as it is commanded by the statute of 34. Ed. 3.
cap. 1.

Five to be assessed openly.
18. But this fine (or pain) awarded by the discretion of the Justices of P.
shall do the more good, both to the Prince in profit, to the people in
example, and to the Justices themselves in credit, if it be pronounced at the
Bench openly (as it ought to be) and not shufled up in a chamber (or Corner)
secretly, as in some places it has been used to be.

Mitigation of the forfeiture of a statute.
19. I have heard, that even in cases where the statutes do appoint a certain
forfeiture (as v.l. or x. l. etc.) yet the practice is, to mitigate the same by
discretion, if so be that the party will come in upon the Endictment and put
himself in gratiam regis (with or without confession of the fault) as I have
told you before, so that the fine shall be small, where the fault was great,
and the penalty of the Law it self not small.

20. But this manner of doing (in my mind) is so void of sound reason, that I
cannot recommend it to the Justices of peace, but do rather condemn it as a
mockery of the Law, yea I find that sundry statutes (fearing belike some such
thing) have specially prevented it, commanding that Justices of the peace shall
assesse no less fine, then is in those statutes themselves beforehand
appointed.

Estreating for the King.
21. But hitherto we have not sufficiently performed that, which the Commission
of the peace has in these words, Salvis nobis amerciamentis, and alijs ad nos
inde spectantibus, and therefore it is not enough to have assessed the fine,
but we must also disclose the means by which, as well this fine (that is
reduced to certainety by the discretion of the Justices) as all other
amerciaments, and those other penalties and forfeitures also that are
certainly prefixed by words of the statutes, may be levied and brought into
the Kings Coffers.

22. Order was taken by an ancient statute (entitled de Scacario, and noted to
be made. 51. H. 3.) that all Justices, Commissioners, and Enquirers whatsoever,
should deliver into the Exchequer (at the feast of Saint Michael yearly) the
extracts of Fynes and amerciaments, taxed and made before them, that the King
might be duly answered thereof. And the same (in effect) was afterward
confirmed by another statute entitled de forma mittendi extreta ad Scacarium,
which although it be said to be made. 15. Ed. 2. yet forasmuch as it mentions
that the former statute was made in the time of the father of the same King
which made the latter, it must needs be, that either the one, or the other of
them was in the time of King Ed. 1.

23. The statute. 12. R. 2. cap. 10. had allowed to every of eight Justices of
the peace, iiij. s. by the day, for the time of their quarter Sessions, to be
paid (by the hands of the Sheriff) of the Fynes and amerciaments coming of
the same Sessions: But because it was soon after seen, that it was a great
delay to the Justices of peace in this payment, to expect the levying of these
Fynes and amerciaments by estreats first sent up to the Exchequer, and then
delivered thence to the Sheriff (which was at that time the common manner of
levying fynes and amerciaments) therefore it was within two years after (viz.
14. R. 2. ca. 11.) provided, that the estreats of Justices of peace should be
indented (or doubled) and the one part thereof delivered by them to the
Sheriff, to the intent that he may levye the money thereof rising, and pay the
Justices their wages by indenture between him and them to be made, that
thereupon he may have allowance upon the passing of his account, and the other
part to be sent into the Exchequer.

24. And hereby (as I think) the estreats of the Justices of the peace be now
an immediate warrant for the Sheriff, to levy, not only the fynes and
amerciaments, but also all other issues, penalties, losses, forfeitures, and
sums whatsoever, arising before them: For the words of the statute are
general (the money thereof arising) and there, whatsoever sums are to be
estreated into the Exchequer, the same are also to be levied by the Sheriff.

25. And these are properly called Estreates, of the word Extracta, because
they be short notes (or memorials) extracted or drawn out of the Records, by
the Clerk of the peace, and by him indented and delivered the one part to the
Sheriff and the other to the Barons of the Exchequer, bearing this (or the
like title) Extract. finium and amerciamentorum forisfactorum ad generalem
Sessionem pacis tentam apud Trym, etc. Coram, etc. For the whole form of the
making whereof there is full direction given to all Clerks of Estreates by the
statute. 7. H. 4. cap. 3. whereunto I refer them.

26. Howbeit, I do not think, Iu. of the P. ought to have ca^e of the
Estreats.
that in our case this duty of estreating is so peculiar to the Clerk of the
peace, but that the Iu. of P. themselves, ought also to have a common and
careful eye unto it: For if you remember, it is both specially provided for in
the Commission, and also an Article of their oath, to see unto the faithful
entry and certificate of the issues, fynes, forfeits, and amerciaments that do
happen before them, and therefore it were well done (in my opinion) if the Iu.
would by turn (or otherwise) both take knowledge of things that have passed
before them, and also take order that the same be certified accordingly: lest
otherwise it lie altogether in the power of the Clerk of the peace to save or
slay (as one said) the Sparrow that he holds closed in his hands.

Of executory process, and execution for the parties that sun, or for other
persons, and of the restitution of goods stolen. CHAP. 18.
1. ALbeit that the Justices of the peace have this power to make warrants for
levying the amerciaments, fynes, and other forfeits, that grow unto the King by
their service, yet is it commonly thought, that they may not, (but in some
cases only, and that by special words of the statutes) make execution (for
them that will sue) of such part of the forfeiture, as the statutes do appoint
for them.

2. For most commonly the party that will sue is by the statutes put to his
action at the common Law, for recovery of that which he is to have, growing
upon conviction of any offense contrary to the statutes, for which he is to
commence his action (or bill) of debt: But where they have power, either by
their Commission, or by any statute to hear and determine any cause at the
prosecution of a private person, I do not see how the cause can well be said
to be fully determined, till the complainant has had the effect of his suite,
which cannot be without execution.

Liveries
3. For the moity growing to the Informer upon the statute of Liveries (8. Ed.
4. cap. 2.) they shall make such execution, as ought to be had in recovery of
debt or Trespass.

High ways.
4. And the Estreats (made by the Clerk of the peace) of forfeits for default
of amending high ways, are a sufficient warrant to the Constables to levye the
same by distresses to the use of the Churchwardens of the Parish where the
default was, 11. Iacobi ca. 7. in Ireland.
toward the amendment of the said ways.

Perjurie.
5. So upon the statute of perjurie, made in 28. El. cap. 1. in Ireland. And
peradventure search will afford some more examples: but these may suffice for
my desire, which is not (in this, or any the like) to recount all, but to make
good proof of that which I offer and propound, the rather that the Justices
and Clerk of the peace may thereby take occasion to look upon the statute
whenever Execution shall be prayed for any cause depending before them upon
any statute whatsoever.

Restitution of goods stolen.
6. And because the awarding of restitution of goods stolen to the owner, or
party robbed (after the attainder of a felon by reason of the evidence given
by them) is a manner of execution for the party: 28. H. 8. ca. 10. and 4. Ma.
cap. 6. in Ireland.
I may without violence bring hither the effect of the statutes made upon that
point, and lying within the authority of Justices of the peace, which stands
thus, if any felon of goods, money, or chattels, taken from any of the Kings
subjects be indicted, arraigned, and found guilty thereof, or otherwise
attainted, by reason of evidence given by the party robbed, or the owner of the
said goods, money, or chattels, or by any other by their procurement, then
shall such party or owner be restored thereunto, and the Justices before whom
such finding guilty or such attainder shall be, shall have power to award writs
of Restitution of the goods stolen in specie, if they may be found, and if they
cannot be found, or that the property be altered, then they may award
Restitution of the felons goods.

Of certifying the Records of the Sessions of the peace to other Courts or
officers. CHAP. 19.
1. AS I have already manifested, that Justices of the peace have not
sufficient power (of themselves) to hear and determine all causes, whereof
they have in their Sessions authority to enquire: So also there be sundry
things determinable before them there, which nevertheless may (in some
respects) be brought to a second handling, either to the end to reverse that
which they have done, or that their doings may be an evidence and testimony in
the trial of causes before other Judges.

2. And because this cannot in any sort be performed, without the presence of
those former Records (or the transcripts thereof) which began with the Justices
of the peace, it is therefore requisite that they do make certificate of them
unto those other Courts, or officers that shall use the same.

3. But as this certificate ought in some cases to be made by the Justices of
peace (or their Clerk) without any writ of Certiorari therefore directed, and
in some other cases they may spare to certify, until that writ (or some other
commandment) be brought unto them: So also sometimes they are to cert^fie and
send up only a Tenor (or Transcript) as I have formerly said of the Record
before them, and sometimes the very Record it self must be conveyed from them.

4. But in cases where Justices of the peace have power to receive Endictments,
and no power to proceed any further upon them, as in cases of Treason and some
others which I have formerly declared, there they ought to send up and certify
the Endictments themselves into the Kings Bench, and that of duty without any
Certiorari commanding the same, because having none authority to hear and try
the offenses, the Records thereof shall be unprofitable before them: and
therefore they can have no just cause to retain them.

5. And so if a man that is bound to keep the peace and to appear at the next
Sessions of the peace do make default of appearance the Recognisance it self
(together with the Record of that default) must be estreated into the
Exchequer, that execution upon the Recognisance may be had there. 3. H. 7. ca.
1. and so ought it if it be presented, that the party has forfeited his
Recognisance by breach of the peace. And likewise if it be presented before
them, that the chattels of a man attainted of felony, be in the hands of
another; For, in these and such other cases where they cannot of themselves
proceed, they ought to send the Records to such as have authority to determine
upon them, and otherwise they do not discharge that duty, which the words
Salvis, etc. and alijs ad nos indespectantibus, in the Commission do seem to
expect at their hands.

6. Touching the Certiorari, it is of force (if it be made accordingly) to
remove not only Endictments, or other executory Records, wherein the Justices
of peace can go no further, and whereof I have spoken already, but also the
Records of causes fully and lawfully heard and determined by them, to the end
that they may be reversed and annulled in the Kings Bench, if good matter and
cause do require it.

7. For that pre-eminence has the Kings Bench, and all other the higher Courts
to write to the Justices of peace, to certify their Records that do make for
the trial of causes hanging in them, as you may read in 19. H. 6. 19. where
the Justices of the common place did send to the Justices of peace for an
Endictment, because in a writ of conspiracy (brought before them) it was
material to have it.

8. And yet they of the common place do not use to write for Endictments or
such other Records, unless they be thereunto induced, by cause hanging in
their own Courts before them: For otherwise the right way to remove them is by
Certiorari out of the Chancery, from whence they may be transferred (by
Mirtimus) to any other Court. 41. li. Ass. pl. 2. per Knyvet chief Justice.

Matters by several Statutes specially appointed to be done and executed in
the Quarter Sessions. CHAP. 20.
1. We have hitherto labored and run over such things as are common to all
general Sessions of the peace, and yet because there be certain matters that
are by several statutes specially appropriated some to any, and others to some
one of the quarter Sessions, it will not be amiss to set forth what Sessions
is and ought to be called a Quarter Sessions.

2. Every quarter Sessions is a general Sessions of the peace, and is styled
generalis sessio pacis, but other Sessions which are held upon special
occasions, although all the articles inquirable in the Sessions of the peace be
given in charge are not Quarter Sessions nor to be styled generalis sessio
pacis but only Sessio pacis, etc.

3. This Quarter Sessions is so called, because it is holden quarterly, viz.
four times in the year, and the stat. of 4. H. 7. cap. 12. calls these
four Quarter Sessions principal Sessions, for that in them chiefly the whole
power and authority of the Justices of peace does shine and show it self more
then in other Sessions.

4. These Quarter Sessions have been appointed by several statutes to be
holden quarterly and at special times, and therefore it will not be amiss for
our better instruction to peruse such statutes as do either in deed or in show
concern this point.

5. The stat. of 25. Ed. 3. cap. 8. ordains That the Justices of peace make
their Sessions in all the Counties of England at the least four times in the
year, viz. at the Feasts of the Annunciation of our Lady, Saint Margaret, S.
Michael, and S. Nicholas: and also at all times that shall be needful
according to the discretion of the same Justices.

6. But this ordinance was altered as to the times by the Stat. of 36. Ed. 3.
cap. 12. which ordains, that in the Commission of the peace shall be
contained that the Justices of peace shall hold their Sessions four times in
the year, viz. one within the Vtas of the Epiphanie, the second within the
second week of Lent, the third between the Feasts of Pentecost, and Saint
John Baptist, and the fourth within eight days next after Michaelmas.

7. But this is again altered as to the times by the stat. of 12. R. 2. cap.
10. which has ordained that the Justices of peace should hold their Sessions
once in every Quarter of the year at the least, without expressing any
certain time, and hereupon, as I conceive, it gained the name of the
Quarter Sessions, and ever sithence has been so called. For before this
statute, although four Sessions were to be held yearly, yet the same were not
quarterly.

8. But after this in Anno secundo H. 5. cap. 4. there was another stat. made,
whereby it is ordained that the Justices of the peace in every Shire named of
the Quorum be resiant within the same Shire except Lords named in the
Commission of the peace, and also except the Justices of the one Bench and of
the other, the chief Baron of the Exchequer, Sergeants at Law, and the Kings
Attorney for the time that the same Justices, Chief Baron, Sergeants at the
Law, and the Kings Attorney be attending and occupied in the Kings Courts, or
otherwise in some other place occupied in the Kings service, and also make
their Sessions four times by the year, that is to say, in the first week
after the Feast of S. Michael, the first week after the Epiphanie, the first
week after Easter week, and in the first week after the Translation of Saint
Thomas the Martyr, which is the third of July, and more often, if need be.

9. Now there are diverse offenses which by several statutes are inquirable,
and some other things are to be done by the Justices of peace, for the well
ordering of the Commonwealth only at the Quarter Sessions, because the
Statutes themselves do appoint the Quarter Sessions for the enquiring and
doing of the same.

10. The Statutes which do appropriate diverse matters to the Quarter Sessions,
or to some one of them are these that follow, viz.

11. By the Stat. of 1. H. 7. cap. 7. unlawful hunting in forests, parks, and
warrens with painted faces, vizzards, or otherwise disguised is to be punished
by Fine, to be assessed at the next general Sessions of the peace, which is
to be intended of the quarter Sessions which were publicly known, and not of
any Sessions held upon special occasion.

12. So likewise by the Stat. of 11. Iac. cap. 7. in Ireland, the defaults for
not amending of highways according to that stat. are to be punished at the
next Quarter Sessions.

13. So likewise perjurie and subornation of perjurie are by the stat. of 28.
Eliz. cap. 1. in Ireland, to be punished in the Quarter Sessions.

14. Also by the statute of 11. Caroli cap. 4. in Ireland, the Justices of
peace, or the more part of them, may at any Quarter Sessions give order for the
erection of houses of Correction, and for stocks of money and all other things
necessary for the same, and for the government thereof, and such houses of
Correction are to be purchased, conveyed or assured upon trust to such persons
as by the Justices of peace, or the more part of them, in their Quarter
Sessions of the peace shall be thought fit, and such Justices may at their
Quarter Sessions of the peace next after such houses shall be built, and so
from time to time appoint Governors or masters thereof, and may make them such
allowance and maintenance as they shall think meet. And if the masters of
such houses do not every Quarter Sessions yield a true and lawful account
unto the Justices of peace of all such persons as have been committed to their
custody, or if the said persons trouble the Country by going abroad, or
escape from such houses of Correction, the most part of the said Justices in
their Quarter Sessions may Fine the said Masters and Governors as they shall
think fit.

15. In like manner by the statute of 10. Car. cap. 18. in Ireland, the
Justices of peace in their open Sessions have power to enquire, hear and
determine the defaults of Vnder-Sheriffes, Sheriffs, Clerks, or the Clerks
of Under-sheriffes, and the defaults of bailiffes of Franchises for not duly
executing their office according to the said stat.

16. So likewise by the stat. made in Anno 10. Car. cap. 26. in Ireland, the
Justices of peace in the Quarter Sessions with the assent of the Grand Jury
have power and authority to tax and set every inhabitant in any such County,
Baronie, City, Borough, Town or Parish within the limits of their
Commissions to such reasonable aid and sum of money as they shall think, by
their discretions, convenient and sufficient for the new building, repairing,
reedifying and amendment of any Bridges, Causeyes, and Toghers, and after such
taxations made, the said Justices of peace shall cause the names and sums of
every particular person so by them taxed to be written in a Roll indented, and
shall also have power and authority to make two Collectors of every Baronie,
City, Borough, Town or Parish for Collection of all such sums of money by
them set and taxed, which Collectors receiving the one part of the said Roll
indented under the Seals of the said Justices shall have power and authority
to collect and receive all the particular sums of money therein contained,
and to distraine every such inhabitant as shall be taxed and shall refuse
payment thereof, in his lands, goods and chattels, and to sell such distress,
and of the sale thereof retain and perceive all the money taxed, and the
residue (if the distress be better) deliver to the owner thereof. And likewise
the said Justices of the peace have power and authority to name and appoint
two Surveyors which shall see every such Bridge, Causey, and Togher builded,
repaired and amended from time to time as often as need shall require, to whose
hands the said Collectors shall pay the said sums of money taxed, and by them
received, and that the Collectors and Surveyors and every of them, and their
executors and administrators, and the executors and administrators of them, and
every of them from time to time shall at the public Sessions of the peace make
a true declaration and account to the Justices of peace of the Shire, City, or
Town corporate wherein they shall be appointed Collectors or Surveyors of the
receipts, payments and expenses of the said sums of money, and if they or any
of them refuse that to do, that then the Justices of peace from time to time
by their discretions shall have power and authority to make process against
the said Collectors and Surveyors and every of them, their executors and
administrators, and the executors and administrators of every of them by
Attachments under their seals returneable at the general Sessions of the
peace, and if they appear then to compel them to account as is aforesaid, or
else if they, or any of them refuse that to do, then to commit such of them as
shall refuse toward, there to remain without bail or mainprise till the said
declaration and account be truly made, and the said Justices have full power
and authority to allow such reasonable costs and charges to the said Surveyors
and Collectors, as by their discretion shall be thought fit and convenient.

16. And likewise by another statute made in Anno 10. Carol. ca. 15. in
Ireland, the Justices of peace have power in their Quarter Sessions to enquire,
hear and determine all and every offense and offenses of plowing, harrowing,
drawing and working with Horses, Mares, Gueldings, Garrans, and Colts by the
Tail; And also of pulling the wool from living sheep in stead of clipping or
shearing of them, and to punish the offenders by Fine and Imprisonment.

17. So likewise by the statute of 33. H. 8. ca. 9. in Ireland, the wages of
Artificers and Laborers are to be rated twice in the year: viz. at the
Quarter Sessions next after Easter for that half year following, and at the
quarter Sessions next after Michaelmas for the other half year, and the wages
of servants which are to serve by the year to be rated in the Quarter Sessions
next after Easter. And in like manner by the statute of 13. R. 2. cap. 8. the
Justices of peace in any general Sessions are to set rates upon victuals and
to punish the victuallers which break those Rates.

18. But here M. Lambard in his fourth book, cap. 19. of the Quarter Sessions
would make us to believe that if the quarter sessions or general sessions of
the peace be not holden at the precise times appointed by the said statute of
2. H. 5. cap. 4. but that the same be held at any other time, the Justices of
peace have no power to enquire of, hear, determine, or otherwise to intermedle
with any of the matters aforesaid, which are appropriated to the quarter
Sessions, for says he such Sessions as are not held at the times prescribed by
the said statute of 2. H. 5. are no Quarter Sessions, and then all that is done
before the Justices of peace concerning the matters aforesaid in any sessions
holden at any other time is coram non judice, and without warrant, but herein I
am not of M. Lambards opinion, for that the sessions named in some statutes,
the principal sessions, in others the open Sessions, and in others the
general or quarter sessions of the peace are all one and the same, and are all
styled by one and the same style, that is, generalis sessio pacis, and there is
not any Sessions styled by the name of Quarter Sessions, although in common
parlance we call them so, because they are held quarterly. So as those statutes
which refer any thing to the principal, the public, open or quarter
sessions are all to be understood of that general Sessions which is held
quarterly, and all those things may be there handled, although the same be not
held at the precise times prescribed by the statute of 2. H. 5. as M. Lambard
would have it to be, for the authority whereby the general sessions of the
peace are held is not the statute of 2. H. 5. nor any other statute, but the
Commission under the great seal, whereby the Justices of the peace are
authorized to hold their sessions at such times and places as they or any two
or more of them, so as one be of the Quorum, shall think fit to appoint.

19. Also the statute of 2. H. 5. cap. 4. has not any negative words,
videlicet, that the sessions should not be holden at any other times then
those which are mentioned in the same statute.

20. But if the statute of 2. H. 5. had been in the negative, or else if the
Commission had been specially grounded upon that statute as formerly from 36.
E. 3. until 12. R. 2. it was grounded upon the statute of 36. E. 3. ca. 12.
wherein express mention was made of the special times wherein the Sessions of
the peace should be holden, I should have been of M. Lambards opinion.

21. So as upon consideration of all the statutes and of the Commission, I am
of opinion clearly that the general Sessions of the peace held quarterly,
although at other times then are mentioned in the said statute of 2. H. 5. are
holden by good warrant and authority, and are both general, principal, open
and Quarter sessions within the meaning of all the said statutes, and makes
not any nullity of the Acts done therein, neither are the Justices punishable
for not observing the time appointed by the said statute of 2. H. 5. because
the Commission does dispense with the statute in that point, yet
notwithstanding I could wish that the Justices of peace by reason of their oath
would be careful to hold their Quarter Sessions at those appointed times.

Of the Special Sessions of the Peace. CHAP. 21.
1. THe special Sessions of the peace do vary from the general, in this
chiefly, that they be holden at other times when it shall please the Justices
themselves, or any two of them (the one being of the Quorum) to appoint them
upon any special occasion. And this power they have, not only by the
Commission, but also by the statute 2. H. 5. c. 4. which allows them to do
it more often then the four times, if need do so require.

2. Lamb. li. 4. page 623.
They be also (for the most part) summoned for some special business, and not
directed to the general service of the Commission: And yet there is no doubt,
but that all the Articles within the Commission of the peace, are both
inquirable and determinable at any special Sessions of the peace, if the
Justices shall so please.

3. M. Fitzh. uses a third difference between the general and special
Sessions of the peace: What things be inquirable at the special Sessions of
the Peace.
affirming, that whereas at the general Sessions, the Justices of P. ought of
duty to give in charge, all matters (within the Commission or statutes) that
are to be determined before them: yet nevertheless at the special Sessions
they are at liberty to give in charge, either all or any of them, Ibid.
as it shall seem good unto themselves.

The form of the precept for Summons of a special Sessions may be thus.

Of the Rewards and punishments due to the Justices of Peace in respect of
their Sessions. CHAP. 22.
1. VVHilest it was at the liberty of the Justices of peace to hold their
quarter Sessions as short time as they would, the law did not allow them any
wages for their pains: But when the statute (13. R. 2. ca. 10.) had bound them
(under pain of punishment) to continue their Sessions three days together (if
the affairs of their office did so require) the same statute thought it meet
also, The wages of the Just. of the P. at the quarter Session.
to allow to every of them iiij.s. by the day, for the time of their Sessions,
to be paid by the hands of the Sheriff out of the Fynes and amerciaments
rising of the same Sessions: and that the Lords of Franchises should be
contributories to those wages, after the proportion of their parts of the said
Fines and Amerciaments.

2. But because it was very dilatory for the Justices of peace to take those
wages at the hands of the Sheriff (as I have already touched) upon the Estreat
sent out of the Exchequer: And for that also it grew in question, whether such
Lords as were named in the Commission of the peace should be partakers of the
same wages: the statute (14. R. 2. ca. 11.) did plainly provide, that the
wages of these Justices should be levied and paid by the Sheriff upon
estreates indented between the Sheriff and them: And that no Duke, Earl,
Baron or Baronet (albeit they were Justices of the peace, and did hold their
Sessions with other eight Justices) should take any wages for their office in
their behalf.

3. And hereof also M. Mar. collecteth that how many soever Commissioners of
the peace there shall be assembled at these Sessions: yet only eight of them
shall receive the wages: because (says he) that at such time as these wages
were first appointed, the Law did take knowledge and make allowance only of
eight Justices and no more. And he also makes it doubtful, whether it be not
in the power of the Barons of the Exchequer, to appoint which eight, when more
be assembled at the Sessions, shall have the wages paid unto them.

4. For the first point, it would be somewhat hard (indeed) to strain that
statute so far, as to give wages thereby to so many Justices as be now at
these days in every Shire, and would be present at the Sessions: and
concerning the latter point, it seems by the latter Statute it self, that
the sheriff shall first pay the wages, and then the Barons shall make the
allowance according to the Indenture: So that I see no liberty of such
nomination left unto the Barons.

5. I confess that it might breed both offense against the Sheriff, and a
jealousy among the Justices themselves, to have one of them preferred before
another in this payment: and therefore I think it wisely done (as it is
somewhere used) to bestow the whole allowance upon the defraying of their
Common Diet.

6. If the Fynes and Amerciaments of the same sessions (says M. Mar.) will
not fully amount to the sum of the wages then due to the Justices, yet shall
the wages be ratably paid out of them so far as they will extend.

7. Hitherto of reward, henceforth of punishment. Punishment at the Common Law.
It seems by the opinion of some Justices (2. R. 3. 10.) that if a Justice of
the peace do any thing of Record ignorantly, and for want of knowledge, that
he shall not be punished for it. Lamb. li. 4. page 630.
And this opinion of theirs is not new in this realm, although it be
otherwise truly said, Imperitia quoque culpae adnumeratur: for you may read in
the old laws of King Edgar (cap. 2.) and of King Canut. (cap. 14.) that if a
Judge had erred in his office, he might then have excused himself by oath;
That he did it not of evil mind, and that he knew not how to do better:
which I speak not to comfort men in careless ignorance, but to show you that
men may err and (erring by infirmity) they are not altogether unworthy of
pardon: and withal to let the Justices of peace see, that it may be a fault to
err by ignorance, and that therefore they ought to stay (where they meet with
non liquet) as their own Commission does direct them.

8. Now on the other side, if a Justice of the peace will craftily embezell an
Endictment or wilfully raze any part thereof, or maliciously enrole (or file)
that for an Endictment which was never found by the Jury. Then by the
Resolution of all the Justices assembled before the King in the Starrechamber,
2. R. 3. a Commission may go out to enquire (by the oaths of twelve men) of
such his misdemeanour, and if he be convicted thereof, he deserves to loose
his office, and to make Fine to the King according to the quantity of his
misprision and offense, Ibidem fol. 10. And even so may he be punished (as this
book leads me to think) if he alter an Endictment of Trespass, into an
Endictment of Felony, howsoever the opinion (27. lib. Ass. pl. 18.) be found
against it.

9. A Justice of the peace may also be indicted of the unlawful taking of
money for doing his office, or of such other falsitie, Fitzh. Na. b. 243. And
if he cause a man to be endicted at the Sessions by former conspiracy, or
indirect practice, he is punishable for it, as a private man. 21. E. 4. 67.

10. But if (in the handling of a cause at the open Sessions) it happens him
to speak against an offendour somewhat excessively, yet he shall not be
punished for it. Iuris enim executio non habet injuriam: Nevertheless, Judges
ought not to abuse their tongues by intemperance, but they must rather take
great heed (as Cic. pro Font. said) Quibus verbis utantur, ne quid nimis
moderate positam, ne quid ab aliqua cupiditate prolapsum verbum esse videatur.

FINIS.
A brief Roll of the Articles and matters to be given in Charge and inquired
of by the Grand-Iury in the general or quarter Sessions of the peace, set
forth in two Columns: the first containing the Offenses, the second declaring
the several punishments which are to be inflicted for every particular
Offense. The offenses consist of these five parts following. viz. 1. Of
Treasons. 2. Of Felonies. 3. Of Misprisions. 4. Of Praemunires. 5. Of Finable
Offenses.

1. Concerning Treasons, it is to be observed that at the Common Law before the
tenth year of King Henry the seventh, there were two sorts of Treasons, viz.
high Treason and petty Treason: but now by the statute of 10. H. 7. ca. 21.
all such offenses as at the Common Law were but petty Treason are made high
Treason.

2. Concerning Felonies, they be of tWo sorts: viz. Felonies of death, for
which the offender shall loose his life, lands, and goods; and felonies not of
death, for which the offendour shall neither loose life nor lands, but shall
forfeit only his goods and chattels: and either have his pardon of course, or
otherwise be punished by imprisonment, whipping, or burning in the hand, as
the case shall require.

3. Concerning Misprisions, they be of three sorts: viz. Misprisions of
Treason, Misprisions of Felony, and other Misprisions.

4. Concerning Praemuniries, they are of two sorts: the one is the extolling of
foreign power and Jurisdiction in this Kingdom: the other is for prosecuting
causes in the Ecclesiastical Courts for matters merely temporal, and
determinable at the Common Law.

5. Concerning Finable Offenses, they are of four sorts: viz. First, Offenses
of force and violence; Secondly, Offenses of fraud and deceit; Thirdly,
Offenses of Omissions, and neglects of Officers and others; and lastly, other
abuses and enormities of several sorts tending to the hurt and prejudice of
the Commonwealth.

and subjects whatsoever they be, as well within liberties as without, to whom
these presents shall come greeting. Whereas we are certified by a writing under
the hands and seals of H. C. and B. O. Justices of Peace in the County of
Bedford, of the great decay and mis-hap of this bearer K. B. of the parish of
W. who by sudden mis-hap of Fire had his house burned, and his goods consumed
to the sum of fourscore pounds and upwards, which goods were not all his
own, because that he occupied the Trade of a Mercer; so that, without the
devotion of well disposed people, he is utterly undone with his wife and
children to the number of four. Know ye therefore, that We have licensed, and
do by these presents license the said K.B to ask, gather, receive, and take
the Alms, Charity, and devotion of all our loving subjects inhabiting and
dwelling within the County of Surry, our City of London with the Suburbs
thereof, as well within the Liberties as without, and not elsewhere; Wherefore
we will and command you and every of you, that at such times as the said K. B.
shall come and repair to any your Churches, and other places to ask and
gather the Charity and Devotion of our loving Subjects as is aforesaid, quietly
to permit and suffer him so to do, without any manner your lets or
contradictions, and you the said spiritual persons to declare the tenor of
these presents unto our said Subjects, exhorting them to extend their Charities
in this behalf, and that you the said Constables and Churchwardens will be
ayding and assisting for the collection and gathering of the Alms aforesaid;
In witness whereof we have caused these our letters to be made. Given at our
Manor of K. the third day of November in the two and twentieth year of our
Reign.

competent number of Presidents of Indictments of several sorts, whereby, and
by the help of those directions which are declared in the eighth Chapter of the
second Book, any ingenious Clerk may be able to frame an Indictment for any
offense whatsoever, either at the Common law, or upon any statute: it now only
remains to furnish them with some Presidents of Process which are to be issued
upon those Indictments, and so to conclude this work.
Process upon Indictments and Presentiments, taken out of Mr Lambert, who
collected them out of the old imprinted Book of the Justices of Peace.

The common Process upon other Presentiments, not being in Felony, nor specially
set forth in statutes, is in that old book declared to be, first:

A Venire facias, thus.

IAcobus, Dei gratia, Angliae, Scotiae, Franciae, and Hiberniae Rex, fidei
defensor, etc.
vicecomiti Kanc. salutem:
Praecipimus tibi, quod no^ omittas propter aliquam libertatem in balliva tua,
quin venire facias A.B. de C. in dicto Comitatu tuo yeoman, coram custodibus
pacis nostrae, necnon Iusticiarijs nostris ad diversa felonias,
transgressiones, and alia malefacta in dicto Com. perpetrata audiendum and
terminandum assignatis, ad general. Sessionem pacis comitatus tui proxime post,
etc. ad respondendum nobis super quibusdam articulis super ipsum A.B.
praesentatis, and habeas ibi tunc hoc praeceptum:

Test etc.
And if upon this Venire facias the party be returned sufficient, then a
Distringas must go out, and so the same Process infinite, until he come in,
which is thus.

IAcobus, Dei gratia, Angliae, Scotiae, Franciae, and Hiberniae Rex, fidei
defensor, etc.
vicecomiti Kanc. salutem:
Praecipimus tibi, quod non omittas propter aliquam libertatem in Balliva tua,
quin eam ingrediaris, and distringas A.B. de C. in comitatu tuo yeoman, per
omnia terras and tenementa etc. Et quod habeas corpus ejus coram praefatis
Iusticiarijs etc. ad respondendum etc.

Test etc.
But if Nihil habet be returned at the first against him, then a Capias. An
Alias Capias. A Pluries Capias, which has no change, but the word Pluries for
Alias: and lastly, an Exigi facias must be awarded against him.


This is the general Process: the special must be s ught for in the tenth
Chapter of the second Book, and in those statutes which do namely appoint
them.

A Supersedeas to stay the taking of one that is indicted of some Trespass or
Contempt.

IAcobus, Dei gratia, Angliae, Scotiae, Franciae et Hiberniae Rex, fidei
defensor, etc.
vicecomiti Kanc. salutem:
Quia A.B. de C. in dicto Com. yeoman, venit in Curia nostra coram H.C. milite
and socijs suis custodibus pacis nostrae, ac Justice. nostris ad diversa
felonias, etc. assignatis, apud M. tali die etc. et invenit sufficientem
manucaptores essendi coram praefatis Iusticiarijs ad proximam generalem
Sessionem pacis in dicto Comitatu tenendam, ad respondendum nobis de quibusdam
transgressionibus super ipsum praesentatis: ideo tibi praecipimus, quod de
capiendo praefatum A.B. seu ipsum imprisonando, vel eum ea de causa aliqualiter
molestando, omnino supersedeas. Et si eum ea de causa and non alia ceperis,
tunc ipsum sine dilatione deliberari facias.

Test praefato H.C. milite, apud T. praedictam, die and anno etc.
A Supersedeas to stay the Exigi facias upon an Indictment of Felony.

IAcobus, Dei gratia, Angliae, Scotiae, Franciae, and Hiberniae Rex, fidei
defensor, etc.
vicecomiti Kanc. salutem:
Quia A.B. de C. in dicto comitatu tuo yeoman, venit in Curiam nostram apud M.
tali die etc. coram H.C. milite and socijs suis custodibus pacis nostrae,
necnon Iusticiarijs etc. ac se reddidit prisonae nostrae (occasion quarundam
feloniarum unde coram eis indictatus est) ut in eadem moretur, sicut nobis
constat: Or thus, Quia invenit nobis sufficientem manucaptionem essendi coram
praefatis Iusticiarijs ad proximam generalem Sessionem pacis in dicto comitatu
tenendam, ad respondendum nobis de quibusdam felonijs, unde coram eis
indictatus existit, ideo tibi praecipimus, quod de ulterius exigendo praefatum
A.B. ad aliquem Comitatum tuum, vel eum imprisonando, sive ipsum ea occasion
molestando, omnino supersedeas. Et habeas ibi hoc Breve.

Test, etc.
Some other forms of Supersedeas there be in that old Book, proceeding from
one Justice of Peace, which I do pretermit, because I see not how they be
warranted at this day: Nevertheless this Precept following I will draw from
thence, that others may advise upon it.

For the removing of a petit Constable.

IAcobus, Dei gratia etc.
vicecom. Midd. necnon capitali Constabulario hundredi de W. and eorum
cuilibet, salut.

cuilibet vestrum conjunctim and divisim praecipimus and mandamus, quod I.T. and
R.M. ad omnia and singula eid. officio incumbentia been and fideliter exercenda
and exequenda (prout ipsi nobis inde respondere voluerint) jurare faciatis:
dictisque W.P. and R.S. similiter injungentes, quod ipsi de dicto officio
ulterius exercendo and exequendo nullatenus se intromittant, quousque aliud de
nobis habuerint mandat. Et quicquid inde feceritis, Justice. nostris ad pac.
nostram in dicto commit. conservandam assignatis ad proximam general. Sessionem

parcella, ad manus tuas devenerunt, tunc tu bona and catalla praedicta eid.
G.H. deliberari facias indilate: Et si bona and catalla praedicta ad manus tuas
non devenerunt, tunc de bonis and catallis praed. I.S. quae in manibus tuis jam
existunt seu in posterum ad manus tuas devenerint verum valorem praed. trium
libr. deliberari facias, unde per Barons de Scaccario nostro super computum
tuum habebis allocationem, secundum formam statut. in hujusmodi casu edit. and

The Return of a Certiorari, sent to remoove an Indictment, may be thus:

First, upon the backe-side of the writ of Certiorari, endorse these, or the
like words:

Executio istius Brevis patet in quadam Scedula eidem Brevi annexa. And that
Scedule may be thus.

EGo A.B. unus custodum pacis, ac Iusticiariorum Dom. Regis, ad pacem in dicto
Commit. Kanc. conservandam, necnon ad diversa felonias, transgressiones, and
alia malefacta in eod. Com. perpetrata audiendum and terminandum assignatorum,

Then take the Record of the Indictment, and close it within the Scedule, and
