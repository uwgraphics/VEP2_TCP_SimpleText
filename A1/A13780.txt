Here begins a song of the Lords Supper.
O God who is worthy thy great love to express
Which y^ on us have showid or with word it inlarg
For when Satan, with sin was like us to oppress
Thou se^dyst thinown begotten son us to discarg
Through his godli life and or the end of his viage
He ordained a sign, for our weke souls most holsom
Whereby we should thynk on the love of his personage
And remember his death, until the time he comme.
Give attentyue ears, I heartily you desire
To hea^e things profitable, leest profyt escape by
Therefore diligently to harken I you require
Ye will call it profyt, I dare well veryfy
To be inflamed with Christ's love, as with fire heuenly^
For with gods grace, I will tell you the holesom
Of Christ's supper, assigned very necessary
For us to remember the Lords death till he com.
Diverse virtuous namynges, has this holy sign
Called the Lords supper, in the pistle of saint Paul
Again a Communion, Christ's church to conioyne
In charytie by a supper universal
And thanks geuyng to God, for his benefyttes all
And a will of sins forgyuenes, to deaf and dom
And by this text, do thus me to your mind to call
I remembrance of the Lords death, until he com.
The Lords supper, is Christ's institution pure
In the which, bread and wine given and his word adjoined
Was given his body and blood, which did our souls cure
Set forth now, that all they which have a faithful mind
In these words, broke and shed for you, with a low kind
Shall have remission of there sins most noysom
pe thimbecilite and dwolnes of our flesh. So graciouse is he to condescende
unto our weakness / to make us perfect in mind. He did miracles some time by
bare words / and eftsone by a sensyble instrument / as when he laid claye
tempered with his own spet^^ upon ye blysomes eyes to give him his sight Io.
ix. And all to feed our exterior senses / that they might hau^ to hold them
by / higher to clyme into our understanding / and faith. Thus therefore does his
goodness / by these exterior Sacraments or elements of water bread and wine /
serve our senses to move / monisshe / and to counforte us inwardly. So said he
unto the people of Israel by Moses. Exo. xiij
For this cause have I commanded you / this ceremonye (meaning the eating of
y^ passh lombe) that I would put my power and beneficence (whereby I delivered
you / and brought you out of bondage) into your handis / and lay them present
before your eyes / that with your handis ye might grope and feel them / and with
your eyes^se them / lest at any time ye should forget my benefyts / not having
my law ever in mouth and mind. But and if we were once (as we shall be) al
together spiritual / immortal gloriouse et cetera / clogged no more with this
carnal burden of our corruptible and foryetfull flesh / then needs it not /
us any more to be thus fed / with siche sensible / elements / symbols / rytes
or Sacraments.

A Sacrament / instituted of God / what it is.
A Sacrament A sacrament.
therefore is an outward sensible sign / whereby God declares and testifyeth
unto the worthey receyuers thereof / his good mind / benevolence and favor
unto us: whereby also he sustayneth and helps ye weakness of our faith. Or a
Sacrament is a testimonye of his graciouse goodness / declared unto us / by that
sensible sign. Or else / Sacraments Sacraments.
are not else but visible exemples / of the favor of God / of his beneuole^ce /
and good mind / towerd us / instituted of God / and of noman / adsewered and
certain testimonies / and holy rememberances of his promises: which under
terrene and erthy signs / represent / and as it were before our eyes /
layeforth celestial gyftis / and call away our mind eue^ from the terrene
signs and elements unto heavenly thoughts. Sacraments But two Sacraments.
also there are but two / of Christis ordinance and institucion / Baptyme and y^
Lordis souper / even the very badges and cognyzances of y^ Christian societe
and fraternite. Right well therefore did Austen Austen.
write in his.c.xvii^. pistle unto Ianuarium. That as God the father did
conseigne and gather unto him the Jews by the badges and lyueryes of
circuncision / and eating of the passover lombe / So did Christ (as it were)
with the new lyueryes and cognyzances / of Baptyme and the Souper / gather and
retain into his service the societe and church of the new people / even the
Christianes. And the use or action / or dew ministracio^ of these sacraments
Sacraments dewly ministered / exercise our faith
/ do excercyse our faith and makes us the more adsewered of his good will
towerd us / as does y^ seall added to the obligacio^ adsewer us more
certaynely of the man's bo^de and promise to be performed. God promised Abraham
to be his God / and also y^ God of his sead / Gen^. xvij upon this co^dicio^ /
yt he / and his / should walk innoce^tly before him / which is / wholly to
depe^de by faith and hope upon his plesures. Which promise had been enough /
had Abraham and his sead ben all spiritual / and not forgethfull / nor
doutfull thereof / in their te^ptacio^s / having ever in mind / both to have
believed the promise of God so fauourablye made without any deserving before:
and so to have been ever in will to perform his part / that is to weit / to
walk innocently before God: But because / the weakness of our faith / namely
in so strong temptacio^s / and the oblyuiouse fraylte of our flesh /
requires (as god well knows) some sensible sign or sacrament / more
presently to certifye and confirm us / to be put ever in mind of his so
ientle a promise: lo therefore a none he adds y^ sacrament of circu^cisio^
unto Abraham / as a seall added to god his promise obligatory now wryte^ in
Abraham's and his seadis flesh. Pau. thus testifying / saying / And Abraham
received the sign of circuncision / even y^ seall obligatory whereby God
bownde him self to iustifye him and all his sead for their feithes saak. ^RO.

A declaracio^ / by the way of comparison of y^ old sacraments with the new.
Now / as under the grace of the Gospel / Baptyme succeeded in the stead of
circuncision: Our Sacraments are not blodye / as were the old.
eue^ so does the lordis souper follow in the place of the old passover / as
the more mylde / ientle / and sweter sacraments then were the old blodye
circuncision and pass lombe / which were never celebrated but blood was shed
/ both in the of kutting of the foreskyn of the chyldes preuey member / and
also in the slaying of the passh lombe with whose blood the doors and wyndows
were stryke^ and crossed. Also as by Baptyme we be iniciated / we profess / and
be co^seigned unto the worship of one God / into the faith of one and the same
Christen religion / eue^ so by the same faith and love expressed at the lordis
souper / we declare our selves to persevere in our profession / now incorporated
into Christ as the very members of yt mystik body whereof Christ is only the
head. By the circuncision and the passover eting / God marked and sealled to
him the Jews. By baptyme and the souper Christ gathers and sealleth to him /
the gentyles and Jews to / as many as will believe.

A declaracion of Baptyme: by the way of a division.
UHer ar two manner of Baptismes: Two m^^ner of b^^ptymes.
the vtwarde locion or wasshing with the water / and wordis of institucion: And
the inward wasshing of the soul with the spiritual water called the holy
ghost. Of the first baptyme / it is written Matthew. the last. Go your ways and
teache all manner nations / baptyzinge them into the name of the father / of the
sone / and holy ghost. Of the second and inward bapty. The inward bapt.
which stondeth upon faith in believing the wordis of promise. It is written Mar.
the last. Whosoever believe and be baptized / shall be saved. Of this inward
spiritual bapt. called the regeneracion from above of the spirit / or second
birthe by faith. It is wryte^ Io. iij. Uerely verily I say unto you except a
man be borne from above / that is to say / of y^ water / there called y^ holy
ghost (for so expowneth Ihon / himself in the.iiij. and.vij. and Isaye.xliiij he
may not come into the kingdom of God. This birthe declares Io. also in the.i.
cap. of his gospel / and in.i. Io. v. saying / Every man that believes Jesus
to be Christ / is borne of God. The first baptyme may be without the second /
as in them y^ be cristened / and be not chosen: as was Simon Magns Act. viij.
and Judas. The one ^aptis. ^aye be ^ith our ^he to^ere.
And the second without the first / as in the elect that dye before they be
baptized with water / so that it be not neglected nor co^tempned of them.
Nether the first avails without the second. The first bapt. with water
represents and signifies the second / as it is said before. The sacraments
ar sensible signs / to co^uaye the spiritual thingis signified by them into
our hertis and soulis. The exterior bapt. bri^geth in the inward.
As did the circumcision of the flesh bring in the circuncision of the spirit
into the heart. Which says Paul profits not / if you kepest not the covenant
smyte^ in the law Gen^. xvij. seled with the seal of circumcision To. ij. When
we be baptized into the name of the father sone and holy ghost: It is promised
by Crist / That whosoever believes and is baptized / he shall be saved. Here is a
promise of our salvation / not for because we be baptized with water / for then
should we be saved by the creature of water and not by Crist: but because we
believe the promise of God promysing salvation in Cristis blood / which belief
brings us into the second birthe to be borne a new of the spirit Io. ii^.
and.i. Io. v. Now whosoever therowe the belief in this promise / is borne a new /
he has yet a another to increase his faith from promise to promise / and from
faith to faith / Romans i. ca. that as the promyses come / so grows our
faith as the mustarde sead / as in Galat. iij. cap. who so ever ye be that are
baptized of the spirit / ye have done Christ upon you. To do Christ upon us.
To do Christ upon us is to be made like / or of one mind with him / to be
incorporated or graffed into him To. vi. for it folowth Galat. iij. all ye ar
one in Jesus Christ: which doing on Christ upon us was well fygured into the
great confort of Adam and Eve and us all / Gene. iij. when God / to kouer their
shameful nakedness made them shepes pylches / cotes of shepes skynnes to endewer
and defend them agenst all stormey tempests / adding unto them saying / Lo /
Adam is made as one of us to know good and evil / Here they saw by faith the
second person Christ God and man / that innocent lombe / as Isay.
prophesied.lii^. and Io. bapt. poynted him with his singer. Io. i. to come and
to be slain for their sins / that they and we might be kouered and clothed
with his rightwysones holiness innocencye wisdom.i. Cor. i. Syn did set God
and us at discord / The mediator or reconcyler yt agrees God and man is
Christ Jesus i. Timo. ij. By faith we are graffed into Christ. The highest
felicite and life most blessed / is to be joined for ever unto God the most
high goodness. Christ is come^ into y^ flesh to join all faithful unto the
most high god. wherefore he is come to give us this most ioyouse felicite. The
some of the hole gospel / law and prophetis consists in this. The some of
the law prophetis and gospel.
That God the father has restored his faithful unto life by his sone Christ /
in who^ he has joined and knyt us unto him / that with him / and for his sake
only / we might be partakers of all thing yt good is. In this some stondeth
forth all our salvation before our eyes in every figure / ceremonye / sacrament
/ and in every part of the scripture / but yet diverse ways / now here in
plain and aperte wordis / and there eftsone wrapped and kouered under figures
and sweet similitudes. In plain wordis / as in Io. his first ca. of his.i.
epistle and of his gospel saying / and that word was made man / and dwelt in
us / also that our fellowship might be with the father and with his sone Jesus
Crist. i. Io. i. That they might be one also as ar we / says Crist to his
father. Io.xvij. that is to say / that they might all be of one fellowship
with us and partakers of our common glory. Oh holy father / says Crist / now I
pray y^ / not only for these my apostels / but also for all them that are to
believe in me through their preching / that they might all be of one faith and
spirit / of one consent into our glory / as ye read To.xb. That y^ world
might believe yt thou have sent me / and that I have given them the glory which
you have given me / that they might be of one fellowship and consent partakers of
the same glory that we have Io. xvij Here ye se how the gospel te^deth into
a unite and knot whereby we are joined together with God the father and Crist /
by his spirit. The Sa^rame^ts ^f ^nite.
Of the which unite / Baptism and the Lordis souper ar the sacraments.
Figura^ue spe^es have their ^roper ^race.
In figures also is y^ same thing spoken in many places / which fyguratyue
speches / as they have some obscurite / so have they a certain grace and ar
mich pleasant in them selves. Is when Io. expresses this unite and societe of
man / with God and Crist under the names of father and sons / calling us the
sons of God gotten by faith in our second baptism / of the sead of the
word through the spirit / as in Io. i. as many as have received him / he gave
them power to be made the sons of God etc. and in the first pistle of Io. v.
and.iij. Also this vnio^ and coniunccion of us with God / is fygured in y^ he
calls himself the wynestok / and us the branches. Io. xv. Also by y^
marriages in the gospel / calling himself the brydegrome / and us the spowse.
yea and by y^ eating of his flesh and drynking of his blood Io. vi. he can
draw us no nerer nor cow^le us no faster to him / then himself to be in us /
and us to dwell in him Thus ye se how the sacraments / that is to say the
faith annexed unto gods promises / joined to the sacraments / gets us more
grace and favor / increased and growing out of one promise and figure into a
another. For y^ thing signified by y^ sacrament / or figured by the figure /
has ever y^ promise upon it. As in baptism / y^ holy ghost is promised us of
Christ: and in the souper / his body to be broken and his blood to be shed for
our sins ar promised to us yt worthily receive them / And therefore our faith
stayed upon these promyses / obtayneth us grace and sorgeuenes of sin / once
known yt God of his mere mercy / without all our deserts makes to us these
promyses for Christ's sake only. And here by the way / to the question
whether children ^hildern that dye before bapt. ar saved by election.
dying before baptism with water / or aftyr / ere they by hearing the e^teriour
word conceive faith / be saved or no? I answer / That for because they are
contained under y^ promise of God made unto Abraham Gen^. xvij. to be the God
of him and of his sead / of which sead is y^ child / seeing that God is now
the God of the gentylis and of their sead / whom he calls the childern of
Abraham / for his eleccio^s sake: therefore is every Christen man's child
contained under the same promise / and by goddis eleccion saved / dye it before
or aftyr baptism in his infancye.

Now shall ye see what godly doctrine / our externe baptism / techeth all
them that are baptized.
^ Now ye not (says Paul) To. v^.
that we who so ever be baptized into Jesus Crist / ar we not baptized into his
death? when we are baptized into Cristis death.
Death / therefore / is the significacion and effect of the vtwarde baptism /
which God never made the popis holy water to signifye nor to put us in mind of
this baptism / whose exterior act in doping into the water techeth us to dye
with Crist / yt is to say / to mortifye that old Adam of ours / to repress
our sensual and carnal affectes / and then are we baptized into Cristis death
to dye with him. The effect of baptis.
And when we thus dye from syn / then burye we our sins in the holes of his
wounds / as Paul says / we are also buried with him / to rise again / eue^ to be
reuyued in spirit and to lead a new life in repentance / now risen again with
Crist. So yt baptyme bears in it self Cristes death / his buryall / and his
resurreccion to be practyzed in our bodies and souls perpetually while we
ly^e. Which life / what else is it then a perpetual cross / even y^ same that
men call penance / but yet not it that the priest inioyneth / Here ye see that
repentance or changing of our life / is included in baptism / and is all one
in effect with it / having her two parts / Mortificacion Mortificacion and
viuificacion.
which they call contricion / out of which there follows viuificacio^ / that
is to live aftyr the spirit.

Repentance / what it is with her two parts Mortificacion and Ujuificacion /
as Paul calls them To. viij.
AT last ye se how it is come unto theffecte of baptyme / the very mystery and
doctrine thereof / which is the death / buryall and resurrection of Crist to be
exercysed and practyzed in us / which heuey life is our perpetual penance all
one in effect with baptyme / as ye se / To. vi. what is Repentance and where it
begineth.
Repentance therefore is the perpetual mortifiying of our flesh and of our
oldeman / which the very sincere fere and love of God works in us at the
sight of our sins seen and known by faith in Cristes death to bring for the
her worthey fruits / that is to say / to lead siche a life as correspondeth
and declares a repentant converted heart. Penance therefore is the repentance
of our sins with a cha^ging of our former life into a new and beter living.
True repentance sees her sins in Cristes wou^des.
Which begins of faith in Cristes death / whereinto we are baptized by the
spirit of faith / knowledging our sins beholden in Christ's wounds. For many
as Cayn / Saul / Judas did see their sins in the stonney tables / throne
agenst the grownde and broken of Moses / and were heuye with unfruitful
repentance / in so miche that fore heaviness and shame they destroyed themselves:
Which declares it plainly that they did not see their sins in Cristes death
y^ promised sead to come / which had dyed for them in deed / had they so
believed in him. But we that se them in his death / know and feel them by our
faith forgiven / which faithful knowledge effect^ouse by love Galat.v.
dryueth us to repentance to lament / y^ ever we should commit that thing /
which as it displeases our so loving and merciful father / so did it bring
his only so derely beloved son that innocent lombe gyltlesse unto the most
paynfull passion and death / Here here this corrasye freateth us with fere and
shame / trowblously grating upon our consciences / syghing and crying for
mercy and forgeuenes / y^ ever we should do that thing which can not be
forgeuen with out the preciouse blood of the son of God / Crist God and
man. Aftyr this mortificacion and detesting of our former life / our faith
setting her sewer hold upon this promise of our fathers voice out of heaven
adsewering Mat. iij.
us that this is his derely beloved sone for whose sake he is apeaced and well
pleased with us now received into grace / we are counfortably reuyued / feling
and certifyed for our faithes saak in Crist / y^ our sins shall not be
imputed to us / nor we never more obbroyded of them before God. When Crist
therefore is puerly preched / and our sins showed us in his death / there
verily and faithfully known / there follows in all the faithful hertes
Repentance with her two parts / as ye se Acts.ij. when Peter had preched
Cristes death and resurrecio^ / and remission of sins in them / then were y^
people pricked and heuey in mind / crying unto Peter and to the other
disciples. ye men our brethern what shall we do? Repent ye (said they) and be
baptized every one of you into y^ name of Jesus Crist / into y^ remission of
your sins.

Baptism compared with the Lordis souper.
^Hus pass we from baptism unto the passover of y^ Lord compared together /
The first comparison.
That as the vtwarde baptyme / does signifye the inward purging of the soul
by y^ holy ghost through our faith believing y^ wordis of promise (for by faith
hertis ar purifyed Act. xv.) Even so does the vtwarde breking of the bread and
powering / forth of the wine / given us / eaten / and dronke^ / signifye and
put us in mind of the brekinge and crucifying of Cristis body and sheding of
his blood / given for our sins / eaten and dronken by faith / and not with our
bodily tethe and flesshely mouths. The.i^. comparison.
Also as y^ visible water signifies the invisible grace / so does the visible
bread broken / and wine powered forth and given us / signifye and represent the
invisible favor and beneuole^ce of our heavenly father / whereby through Cristis
death our syns be forgiven us. The.iij. comparison.
And as the vtwarde baptyme / byndeth us by our own profession to stand to
our promise before God / to forsake the devil and all his suggestions / and to
cleue to one God unto whom we are now consecrated to mortifye our flesh / to
pourge our spots / to continewe and contend into a more pure and perfyt
life: even so when we sit down / at the holy souper / we bind our selves /
into one love and belief in the promise there rehearsed that he gave us his
body to be broken for us / And we bind our selves to give him thankis
perpetual / and ever to persevere in our religion and faith and in a loving
Christian concord / that we all there present might ever more be made one bread
/ one cup / one body jointly cowpled together as members unto Criste our
only supreme head spiritual. ephe. iiij Col. ij.


The passage from under the law unto the grace of the gospel.
FOr a more perfyt preparacio^ unto our new passover lombe Criste. To. vi.
ye shall know / that whylis we pass over this transitory life / either ar we
under the law / or else under grace (as for them that are under nether law nor
grace / and yet will be called most graciouse and grace it self / nor yet of
siche that so exalt them selves above God and his laws that they suffer syn to
have siche dominion over them that it ledeth them into what so ever they lust /
freely with out all punisshme^t and for to do what they list and desyer / I
speak not of / fering nether god nor man.) But yet ye shall note that there be
two manner of laws: Two m^ner of laws
A polityk law made by men / and a spiritual law which are the commandments
of God. A just civil m^^
A man may be a just ciuyle man / aftir a certain civil justice / as were the
Haithen / Turks and Saracens / and yet very infidelis. Also / a man may apere
to himself and to other / to be just / aftir the justice and rightwysenes of
the law of the commandementis / which Paul calls our own rightwysenes To.
x. Romans ix. Romans x. Mat. v.
and Crist calls it the rightwysenes of the pharisais / and yet before god /
a very dampnable ipocryte / as were the pharisayes and Just pharisayes.
Paul himself before his conversion / and as now ar all yt will be justified by
their workis thi^king themselves holiest of all men. The office of the polityke
law.
The office of the polityk law / is with fere of punisshment by the sword to
refrain evil men / from theft / murder / aduoutry / iniuryes or trowbling
of the como^peace / which law is given / as says Paul i. Timo. i. to the
unjust / wyked / and not to the just / iustitia politica et civilly / aftir
the civil justice. The offices of the spiritual law.
The spiritual law / emonge many offices / has these / eue^ to show a man
his sins / then to fear him for so offendi^g god / and so to increase syn /
for where is no law there is no transgression. To. iij.iiij.v.
It works wrath and the punisshment of God. Now let us se who is under this
law.

Some there be that believe / y^ this law of the commandments (which is
called spiritual because it requires our affectes altogether mortifyed from
all evil thoughts and The first degree of the law.
desyers / as baptism techeth us) they fulfill it / so long as they commit
no open or externe act / wherefore nether the ciuyle sword / nor the
ecclesiastical censure may punissh them / for as Moses faith / they live by /
or in them. Leuit. xviij.
yea and they thus lyuinge in the externe face and vtwarde show of the doing
the dedis of the law / think themselves holiest / most honest and perfyt of al
men / How abominable so ever their thoughtis and hertes be with in themselves
/ polluted with inward sheding of innocent blood / wrongs / desaytes /
falsehed / lying / pride / envy / malice / concupiscence and almaner filthynes
/ until these secret sores and venom brekeforth into light / and yet then
ar they not with out some fayer excuse and appare^t color / no less then
Ada^ and Eve pretexed their sins with their broad fygge leaves / so far of ar
these ipocrytes to confess their faults. Under this degree of the law ar all
they yt apere to themselves and to siche like / to fulfill the law right well
/ and to do more to / to merit heaven by their dedis and to break into it like
geauntes and sell their overplus of their merits to the.v. mat. xxv. ^he fru^es
of them that ar under ^his de^re of ^he law ^s to per^ecute and ^urn the
cristens
folisshe virgens which were shut out at the ga^es whiles they went to bye of
their overplus oil. Under this degree of the law was Paul himself / whylis he
persecuted the Cristianes: and yet he lived without the law Romans vij. that is
to say / the law did not her first office in showing him his syn. Werfore he
says of himself / in that state and of the law / That him self was a live /
but the law and sin were dead / because / the law / not yet doing her
office in showing him his syn / worked not the fere of god / nor showed him his
wrath / nor death nor punisshement for it / for the spirit of the law as yet
moved not his pen upon his heart. But now let the law come / not wryte^ in
walls nor stones nor papyr / but written in thine heart with the finger of the
law geuer / and tell the thy sins showing the whose high majesty thou have
offended so grievously. The second degree of the law and to be under it.
Let her work in the her second office in fering and trowbling thy conscience
/ with death dampuacion and hell / and then is the law and syn both a live in
thy heart / and thyself ded / witness is Paul To. vij. Here is a sode^ contrary
mutacion / sed dextere excelsi. but of the right hand of God. This is the
second degree of being under the law / now y^ law accuses / it makes angry
both thyself with thyself with the iugements and punisshme^ts of God / and it
makes / yt god apereth to be wrath with the to / working now in the / as Isay
says / Isaye.xxviij.
a strange work to work his own / which is to bring the from under the
law to be under grace / but yet thou know it not / because you art yet ded.
So long as a man is thus wrought of the Lord / he is in preparing him unto
repentance and leading him unto grace for the law / in this degree is the
vssher or scolemaster Gala. iij. that ledeth or takes forth the trowbled
conscience unto Crist: calling him saying. Come ye unto me all that are pressed
with burden and I shall ease you Mat. xi. Now is the grace of the gospel
offered the / on the which if thou set fastholde by faith / so art you now
under it / certifyed of the benevolent favor and grace of god towerdes the so
mercifully calling the continually his arms spread abroad to enbrace the. And
yet to draw the more nyghe unto Crist and to his father. Thou hear this thy
fathers voice saying upon Crist. This is my derely beloved sone for whose saak
only I am apeaced and well pleased with the. And for because / as one promise
follows a another / so increases our faith like the musterde sead / aftyr
many joyful and comfortable promyses in Crist / he promises to give us his
own body to be crucified and his blood to be forth drawn into the forgeuenes
of our sins. i. Cor. xv
When our faith therefore apprehe^deth this promise steadfastly / then may not
syn nor death fere us no more / for death is swallowed up into victory / the
sting of death is blonted / y^ power and strength of syn / even the law is
enerued / one ioynte shaken from a another / and all by the victory of Cristes
death and resurreccion / which victory is given to us by Jesus Crist.

To confirm this conflicte and progress of man from under the law unto grace
/ have here plain examples of y^ storye of the childern of Israel: exo. xiiij
which so long as they saw Pharao and his host at their tails / they were
afraid and ded / baptized in the red sea / which was a shadewe and figure / of
our baptism: i. Cor. x.
but when they saw their goyde Moses before them / hearing this comfortable
gospel / yt is to weit / Be not afraid / be you still: The Lord will fight
for you / and so saw y^ waters smyten with Aarons staff and diuyded before
their eyes. psalm. xxi To. xv.
(the staff of y^ word of God divides from us the waters of adfliccion) they
went through gladly and Exo. xv
sewerly with great glory and triumph / synging on the the other side / when they
loking bak saw their enymyes drowned with the same waters that were their
salvation. Many siche passages had they / those.xl. years so often tempted and
eftsone conforted agene. Siche daily passages we feel in our selves / syn death
and hell assaughting us / to drive us under grace unto the which we are come so
sone as we hear Crist saying / Take heart and confidence to you / for I have
ouercomen syn / death and hell. Io. xvi.
The waters of trowble must nedis be divided and give place to as many as
aspyre unto the grace of the gospel. What else was fygured / by the turning of
their eyes from the fyery stinging serpents unto the brasone serpent exalted
in the wyldernes? (...). xxi.
There was a great wrestling all the night betwixt Jacob and the angel /
which fygured our state under the.ij. ^enes. ^xxij.
degree of the law / whom Jacob would not let go / till in the morning the
angel had blessed him / and told him his name / and also changed Jacobs name
for Israel / whylis we therefore se our sins in our selves and in the law
which works wrath To. iiij. and makes sin to abownde and increase To.
vij. we are Iacobites wresteling in derkenes with an unknown messagere working
a strange work to do his own in making us Israelites / that is / true
faithful beholding and acknowleging God to be our God forgeuing us our sins
in Crist / This angel of God / if we persevere in this derke and perellouse
battle with him / under the law / will gladly give us y^ victory under the
bright morning of the grace of the gospel / and at last aftir great and long
affliccion comfort us with his name told us to be our almighty one alone for
all sufficient savior. As did Joseph aftyr long trowbling / fering / and
molesting his brethren and father to / at last with tears and wepi^g showed
himself to be their own brother Joseph whom god had sent thither before for
their great counfort. Let us therefore fight constantly and contend in this
mightly batail / to excercyse our faith / that we might be enstructe and armed
with patience and peace of conscience until the morning of Cristis counfort
and help be sprongen over us / albeit yet we halt with Israel one the one
foot / that is to say we feel our flesh alto weak to walk upright in
Cristes precepts / and our affects strogling yet agenst his spirit. This miche
be said for the feling and trying of our selves to be prepared unto the worthey
receiving of the Lordis souper.

The institucion of the souper of the Lord.
UUhen Crist sat at his last souper with his disciples / he took the bread in
his hands / and gave thanks to his father / and broke it / and gave to every
one of his disciples thereof saying. Take it / eat it / this is my body which
is broken for you. And like wise of the cup / saying / This cup is the new
testament or covenant in my blood. Se that ye do this / and as often as ye shall
do it / do it into the remembrance of me. Let us now behold and observe
diligently for our doctrine the accion with all the circunstances of this
souper / and we shall s^^with y^ eye of our faith meruellouse present
consolacio^* Wherefore this holy souper ought hyghly with all reverence to be
eaten and treated / Here we se with our bodily eyes the holy bread broken / and
the holy wine powerdforth (for holy it is now consecrated into so holy an use)
but with y^ eye of our faith / we se presently Cristis body broken and this
blood forth^ powerd into the remission of our sins. The eye of our faith
what it sees in this souper.
Agene / we see with our exterior eyes y^ bread and wine given to us / but with
the eye of our faith we se as presently his body crucified and his blood shede
and given us / Now is his body thus broken and his blood thus shed all together
ours forever. Now is Crist thus once suffering / risen and sitting on the right
hand of his father all ours with is perpetual prayer. For what thing is more
freely ours then that which is given us with his own mouth and delivered us
with his own handis into our ha^dis and mouths? yea but wherefore is he thus
given us? verily to eat and to drink him. That at we eat and drink bodily /
is received into our bodies and converted into our substance made all one
flesh and blood with ours and we all one with it / And her must we ascend
into that spiritual eating and drinking by faith whereof Crist spoke Io. vi. A
spiritual asce^^e.
saying / My wordis ar spirit and life / the flesh profits not / It is the
spirit yt gives this life whereof ye just lives. Aba. ij.
It is the soul that eats and lives by this bread / and not our bodies / of
the which eting says Io. Who so eteth my flesh and drinks my blood he
dwells in me and I in him. Now therefore our souls thus eating him by faith
/ have Crist present / and he is in us by grace governing us with his holy
ghost. And he yt gave us himself / it cannot be other wise / but with him / is
given us also all yt is his / either done / or suffered of him in his body. To.
viij.
Then ar we sewer by our faith in this word. Dedit / dicens / accipite / he
gave it us saying / take it / that he is ours with all his. He was borne therefore
for us of his mother yt we should be borne agene by baptim of the holy ghost. He
was borne for us the son of man / yt we through him might be the sons of God
/ he was tempted for us and bore away the victory / yt his victory might be
ours / he fulfilled the law and was the most rightwyse / that his rightwysenes
might be ours / his wysedom kouereth our folisshnies / his holiness correcketh
our unbelief / his innoce^cye swaloweth up our wykednes / his redemption
sets us in a spiritual liberty / he was made weak to make us strong /
mortal to make us immortal. He descended into the earth that we should asce^de
into heaven / his death is our life and takes away our sins / and for death
and worthy dampnacion / he gives us himself in this present souper our
everlasting life and salvation / he is made for us of the father our
rightwysenes / our redemption / satisfaccion etc. i. Cor. ^. Isa. liij.
And as Isay says / he was wounded for our transgressions and so smyten for
our ungodliness / for the punisshme^t for our correccio^ and peace making was
laid upon him / and by his strypes and his hurt / we are healed / the Lord laid
all our wykednes upon him to pardon us / These therefore his present gyftis and
Crist is our satisfacction.
wordis cannot deceive us / Take it / eat it / this is my body which is for
you broken / for in that / he bids us take it / he certifyeth us that he is
all ours / And in that he bids us eat it / he adsewerthe us / himself to be
all one substance with us / God and man deifying our souls and sanctifying our
bodies to be glorified with his in the resurreccion of our flesh. We must
therefore observe diligently these words / he gave it us / bidding us take it /
eat it / and drink it / and especially these wordis added / which is for you
broken / which is for you given / which for your sins is shed. For herein
consists the peathey weight and our present counforte / here is that heavenly
spiritual fode of our souls wherewith we are refresshed / daily counforted /
and confirmed for ever / So often therefore as we do celebrate this holy souper /
we must do it into y^ remembrance of his death / for this incomparable benefit
and love unable to be expressed rendering to him praise glory and thanks
immortal which lives and reigns with the father and holy ghost for ever.
Amen.

Moreover ye shall diligently observe That in the scriptures / where.ij. or.iij.
things be so inseperably knit together / that either one of them may not be
diuyded from another / or else one must nedis follow the the other: It is
attributed to the one / that at verily pertayneth to the the other / and one name
serves them both or all three. As forbecause at the preching of the gospel /
there follows some Christian congregation gathered together in the belief
thereof / and at last they possede y^ kingdom of heaven / therefore / is the
gospel / or the remission of sins which follows the preching thereof called
the kingdom of heaven / as in Mat. iij. Repent ye for nighe is the kingdom of
heaven said Io. bap. where the kingdom of heaven is taken for the remission of
sins or for the gospel. And in the xviij. who is gretest in the kingdom of
heaven / there is it taken for the congregation of the faithful / And
forbecause meat is not eaten without bread / therefore is bread taken for meat
and for almaner bodily sustinance / In the person of Crist / where the godhed
is inseperably knit to his manhed / it is attributed to the manhed that which
verily pertayneth to the godhed as in Io. iij. Noman ascends into heaven but
he that is descended / the son of man which is in heaven / here the son of
man is taken for thegod head / for as yet / when he spoke these wordis / his
manhed was not ascended / The scripture says Crist dyed / when it was his
manhed only that suffered. Now to my purpose. In the signs or sacraments there
ar many thingis inseperably joined together / if they be of Cristis ordinance /
as ye se in this division and order following / wherefore every one is called by
the same name / yt the the other is called / which sode^ sondrely attributing of
the same name and subsultatory speech not known nor observed / make men to
apere to speak strangely / yea erroneously to some me^ / when they both believe
and speak trwly and godly.

In Baptime.
1 The Element is -- water.

2 The word of institution / is / Go your ways and teache all nations
baptizing them into y^ name of the father the sone and holy ghost / Mat.
xxviij. which words with the Element / make the Sacrament.

3 The word of promise / is Mar. the last ca. Whosoever believes and is baptized
shall be saved. Faith in this promise makes present the holy ghost in ye beleuers
heart now borne a new.

4 The thing / is the holy ghost making holy / purifying and renewing ye soul.

In the Souper of the Lord.
1 The Elements ar -- Bread and wine.

2 The wordis of institucion / ar these / When Jesus had soupt / he took y^
bread in his handis etc. man. xxv
which wordis dewly spoken / it is the Sacrament.

3 The wordis of promise / ar these / Whosoever eteth my flessh and drinks my
blood / dwells in me and I in him / Io. vi. The belief in this promise
brings the thing present into the heart of the faithful receyuer of the
sacrament.

4 The thing is the body of Crist crucified / and his blood shed into the
remission of thy sins.

Now ar these speches true. The sacrament of baptime is the regeneracion and
the renouacio^ of the holygost / purifying and ^euing salvation / so that it be
attributed unto the chief thing in the sacrament / which is the holy ghost.

Likewise if it be asked / whether in the sacrament of the souper of y^ Lord
there be the very natural and real body of Crist / thou see it the fowerth
in order / and is so called / for the inseparable union of it with y^ sacrament
/ wordis and element / so that the bread is so called / the word is so called
/ and y^ thing it self / must nedis be called the same that it is. The bread
and the word / ar so called sacrame^tally: but the thing is so called verily
really and naturallye.

And here is offered the question / whether an infidele or an vnworthey wyked
person eteth the body and drinks the blood of Crist at the souper? Infidels
receive the sacrament but not the thing.
Unto the which Austen answers very well in his.xxi. book of the cetye of God
/ putting difference betwixt the sacrament which stands upon the Elements and
wordis of institucio^ / and betwixt ye thing which sto^deth in the wordis of
promise and faith there to joined. And agene in a sermon of the sacraments of
the faithful. These ar his wordis. He that dwells not in Crist / nor Crist
in him / dowtlesse he nether eteth his flesh nor drinks his blood / albeit
unto his own condemnacion / he eteth and drinks the sacrament of so great a
thing. Here ye se that one may receive the elements as the bread and wine and
not the thing. As was Simon Magus baptized in water / receiving the sacrament /
and yet not the holygost renewing him. And Judas sitting at this souper / did
eat the sacrament of the bread and wine / but not y^ thing / for satan (says
Io. xiij.) entered into him aftir Crist had raught him the morsel of bread.

What it is / worthily or onworthely to receive the sacrament.
FIrst ye shall know that there comes no fruit unto any receyuers of any
sacrament / but only unto them / that call into mind the death of Crist with
holy and devout remembrance / yt he was crucified for their sins and
wassheth them away with his blood / giving him tha^kis immortal / high praise
and glory in this sweet remembrance and faith. Only unto siche men Crist
commends and has committed his body. Only unto these me^ he draws forth
his blood / For these me^ only was he offered up on the altar of y^ cross. So
that they doutelesse slip from y^ trwth / that believe Judas to have had
received the same thing that the other apostles received. For they eat not
verily y^ flesh of the Lord / which in him dwell not nor he in them / for Io.
evangelist even the next gest at Cristis elbowe sitting at his mess testifyeth
that as soon as Judas had received ye soppe / the devil entered into him for his
gest into his soul. Io. xiij.
Item young infantes and men bestraught / albeit they be the members of Crist /
yet may they not with fruit receive it / for these persons may not rightly
remember the mystery of their redemption / nor dewly examyn and prove
themselves before / nor give tha^kis therefore / which things ar cheifely
required at the cebracion of this holy fea^te.

Paul bids every man prove / try / inserche / and examyn him self before
he eats of this bread and drink of this cup: i. cor. xi. Of the proving of
our selves.
for if we had trwly examined our selves we should not have had been so punisshed
of the Lord. Whose mind is that they are with out perell that descend into
their own selves / and with great detestacion of their sins desyer to be the
same that they hear / that is to say the members of ye body of Crist. Nether
vnaptely is this probacion of our selves called the part of the commemoracion
/ when there can be no commemoracion with out the just probacion of our selves.

First therefore let us examyn our selves by y^ twyche stone and Iaco.
squire of goddis commandments / which as a glass shall show us to our
selves to be nothing else in all our dedis life wordis and thoughts but
greuouse sinners / Then let us try our selves whether for our sins we be
sorry in heart and unfeignedly repenta^t / full minded to practice our baptyme in
mortifying our affectes changing our life by faith burying our sins in
Cristes woundis / with him to rise agene into a new state of living / Let us
try our selves to know under what degree of y^ law we be / as it is before
expressed. Search whether you beist as glad to forgive all y^ have hurt the /
even as thou woldist be forgiven of god? Look whether you can espy thy nowne
secret birthe poison and love to thy self sought in all thy dedis thoughts
and wordis rather then the glory of God and profyt or edifying of thy
neighbor? And now se whether thou haste / or desyerst to have that faith and
love / which God commands the to have to him and to thy neighbor / and be
heuye that thou have them not in yt perfeccio^ wherein thou art bownde to have
them / that patience / confidence / constancye / humilite / temperance /
chastity and a will in all thingis comfortable unto goddis will. and if you
aknowlegest these thy nowne sins and imperfeccion unfeignedly / yet art thou a
membyr of the body of Crist / as writes Paul / and may sit down with fere
and reverence / i. Cor. x.
giving tha^kis to God for this inestimable benefyt of our redemption. But this
just probacion as our papistis never practyzed it in themselves / so never yet
taught it they their flocks.

Whylis we therefore thus expende and prove our selves / consydering: who we
were by Adams fall / from what perellis and euillis we are by Crist delivered
undeserved of us / what gyftis ar given us unlooked fore / and agene what we
professed at our baptism / into whose disciplyne we entered / what bataile we
took in hand unto what a captain and heerd man by it we were conseigned and
anointed / called Cristia^s of the name of Crist unto whom we were professed
and our selves yielded / and yet / in all this probacion and rememberance of
our selves / and of our benefitis by Crist: we must apere to our selves
insufficient / and unworthily with condign thankis to have remembered and
believed all these benefyts: and we therefore in our selves ever to confess us
unworthy with the Centurion that Crist should enter into our houses. mat. viij
But be it in case we might / with any vtwarde feigned probacio^ deceive all men /
before whom we testifye our indignite and declare our faith / yet cannot he be
deceived which only sercheth and inseeth hertes and raynes / which also is
the mind and spirit of that body which is compacte and framed of the
congregation of all faithful men.

Also as the Apostle warns us to mortifye our bodies / To. vi.
to be buried and to rise with Crist / so exhorts he us to not suffer sin
to reign in us. i. cor. v. Act. xv.
He commands us to purge and to make us clean from that old leuayne / and to
be purifyed by faith. But verily full cold and ungodly is the probacio^ that
depends of mennis laws and decrees: ^ith he says. They ought not to be
rekened well proved which commend and praise themselves / but they whom the
lord co^me^deth: ij. cor. x.
which commends non but siche as allow and approve his will / known by y^
scriptures. Let not therefore this saying of David never go from thy mind
Blessed is y^ man whom you techest o Lord: Psa. xciij
and out of thy law enstructest him.

And yet albeit yt in these men which thus prove themselves and so eat
worthily there is continual batail with syn / which they here about in their
bosoms / yet eteth he not unworthily / which taken and holden with the spirit
of penance endeuowreth and aspyreth unto this one thing / That as he is deed
with Crist from syn / even so / as I said before / he stryueth to arise agene
with him into a new life / not yielding himself to syn any more to have
dominion over him / but ouercometh thinfirmite of his flessh with the vertewe
and power of the spiritual law that mortifyeth affectes. Job. vij.
For a Cristia^s life is a continual bataile.

And as it is a gloriouse thing / to fight and have victory / eue^ so to be
overcome / it is not only shame in the tents of the Christian field / but also
death and dampnacion. Wherefore the flesh and blood of Crist eue^ for this
cause specially ar asked at the Lordis table of them that are faithful / that
as waryers and soldiers ar fed and anointed with oil / even so ar Cristis
waryers fed and strengthened with the excellent vertewe of the sacraments /
that they might continewe and be strong in batail / and resist the engines of
temptacions / To. viij.
so that there be no condemnacion unto them that are graffed into Crist Jesus:
albeit there be syn / but not imputed for their faithes sake.

But now as faith is the fowndacion of all our rightwysnes and well doing /
^aith is the fown dacio^ of this proving.
even so is it the grownde of our probacion: for who is it that hates the
dominion of syn / or syn it self having the dominion over him / and want the
faith? or who can decerne or make difference of the body of Crist / that is to
say / examyn and prove himself / whether him self be of the body of Crist / To
make difference of the lordis body
and the trwe intiere hole member of his church / which either know not Cristis
law or institution / or will reiecte it? Wherefore the trw prechers teache that
nether our lips / ar to be prepared / nor mouths and gomes to be washed /
that we might worthily receive it / and miche less gloriouse and costly aparel
/ choice of day / nor nowm bir to be sought for it / nether to attribute any
thing to our selves for our own worthey preparingis / by confessions auriculare
/ penance enjoined / satisfaccio^s or other good merits. For Crist did not
institute this table for men filled with workis and trust in their own merits /
but for men fasting / Fasting men who they be.
yt is to say / of faith humbled / contrite / afflicte in spirit / nothing
ascribi^g to their owneselues / They hunger not for Crist yt ar full with in
their own judgment / no more then they admit and receive y^ phisicio^ that
apere hole in themselves. But it behooves here to remember the reiecte pharisay
puftvp with the bosting of his own workis / and y^ received publicane
confessing his own sins. who prove not themselves a right.
And in few wordis they prove not themselves a right which make clean the
vtwarde side of the disshe / the insyde alfowle: when in the only mind and
heart / either pure or vnpure / clean or foul / it stondeth / whether we
receive the sacrament worthily or unworthily.

Furthermore / as John to witness there is noman without syn / so is there some
sin unto death: i. Io. i. i. Io. v.
and some not unto death / They syn unto death / that obstinately persevere in
open crimes / wetingly or else of an affected ignorance impugning the trwth /
never examining nor proui^g themselves tried at the word of god / which eting
this holy souper eat and drink their own condemnacio^. i. cor. xi. Two manner
of unworthy eaters: both punisshed but not a like.
But the other that syn not unto death being penitent / albeit they be negligent
in the proving of themselves by the reason of the frayltye of their flesh and
of some ignorance / for whom we and they ought to pray / yet for their
indignite ar siche tried and punisshed of the Lord unto their own correccio^
lest they be condemned with the world / when the indignite of the first that syn
unto death asks death perpetual and condemnacio^ / where ye se the gylte of
the either vnworthey is unlike / which comes of the abuse of the sacrament: For
unto y^ one vnworthey part / the fault and gylte brings co^demnacio^ / and
to the the other it brings but transitory punisshment for their correccion. For
the Apostle techethe that at Corinthe there were many beleuers yt were plaged
with tra^sitory pains for that they behaved themselves at this holy souper
neglige^tlyer then y^ dignite of the thing required / and therefore were they
smyten not only with deceases / but also with death temporal / that other like
rasshe and negligent vnworthey eaters fered at their ensample should be ware and
admonisshed. For even sode^ death is a pain insticte for syn / Act.v. For in
yt the Apostle said: Many sleep / we understand that siche punisshed persons
should live agene in joy. for the scripture says them to sleap which shall
rise into glory / and therefore he says plainly that they are corrected of the
Lord lest they shuldbe condemned with the world. Of whose sort doutelesse
were they whom the Apostle rebukes / partly because the congregation of the
pore / not tarried for / they did eat the souper / as though it had been
theirowne private souper: so that they exceeding with a certain excess and
superfluite / sought y^ meat of theirowne bellyes rather then the meat of their
mind / nothing regarding the need and pouertye of their own members: And
partly because they were puftvp with a certain suppinite / sloughissh ease
and idleness / mixing themselves with the haithen idollaters of their own cite
/ i. cor. viij and.x.
eating and drinking with them at their tables before their idols / not
remembering the sclawnder given to their weker brethern redeemed with Cristes
blood.

Sewerly their offenses might have seemed but light / to themselves which had
knowledge / as it were in things of themselves not hurtful / and might apere
in sight not unlawful / but indifferent / as some of our ceremonies apere to
some men this day: But yet does saint Paul prosecute and note them with
siche ernest grauite / yt not only the self souper but also y^ mystery thereof
/ he so layth it before our eyes / that he affirms / by siche offenses / we
provoke the wrath of God upon us: and that he would thereby so warn us (both
the excelle^cye of the sacrament and also the dignite thereof so requyring) that
we should have this circu^speccion / even in every act of our life and ryte to
hold and keep our selves wisely with out all manner offendicle / within the
limits of mesure and disciplyne.

When the congregation therefore admit not unto this souper open criminouse
persons except they espy some evident tokens of repentance / they do it aftyr
thensample of Paul / i. cor. v.
delyueri^g up unto satan yt incestuouse Corinthean which defiled his own
stepe mother. Of the vnworthey receyuers
So yt it folowth yet / that of these men the bread and wine is received most
unworthily / which albeit they be not openly known of the congregation / yet
unto death and to their own damnacio^ may they eat and drink it for their own
hid obstinate perseuera^ce in syn whereby they ar excluded from y^ heretage of
heaven / Of the which sort ar they that for fere of shame / for lucre and
advantage feign themselves of Cristes religion and of the gospel / as did
Simon Magus pryse the power of god to do miracles yt he might be the more
esteemed among his own faccio^. Act. viij. Beware papists wherefore ye make
your selves preisstes.
Or siche as for favor or advantage to be esteemed and retained / dissemble
their ungodliness cloked with holy orders succession of apostles with
apostleship and bisshopryk as did Judas the betrayer / which although he had
made a bargayn with y^ pharisais agreed both of the price of Crist and
Cristians to be sold / yet he returned unto the same mess at the Lordis
table to be partaker with his disciples of the same sacrament. At this mess
with Judas sit they or stand / all hipocrytes pharisayes / papists /
simoniaks / filthey concubyne kepers / aduouterers / proud prelates / dronkerds
/ deuowerers couetuouse persons / maliciouse murderers / and yet feign they a
daily ear confession / yt they might in sight worthily apere to come to the
holy souper / nothing less ypocrytes concubynaryes fornicatours etc. so yt if
they should lie a dying / yet should they not / until the sins forsake them
leave their abominable prodigiouse beastely living.

But in what place of the vnworthey receyuers / Unworthey receyuers.
these men ought to be put / which not only by their abominable abuse have
changed and altered this most holy souper / by their own new and strange
decreed vain rytes and ungodly tradicions / have so violated and broken
Cristes first institucio^ / yt of the same souper that Crist celebrated and
confirmed by his inviolable ordinance / there is nothing / not so miche as the
name / or very little left / of what vnworthey sort / ar these men / God se to
it and be judge. Cypriane.
Cypriane in his pistle unto Cecilium warns ernestely and sharply yt in the
administracio^ of the sacraments / we should not in any wise / nor in nothing /
swerve from y^ precepts of the gospel. But the disciples should observe that at
their master Crist taught and did it. And he denies also / those men worthey
to be called / either the friends or disciples of Crist which violate or break
their masters commandment / or altere his ordinance / as did certain men in
his time / put only water into the cup / when Crist consecrated wine and
Only wine is to be consecrated.
no water / of whom Crist testifyeth in his gospel / saying / ye ipocrytes /
ye cast away my commandments to setfast your own traditions. Mat. xv.
I wylnot here tell yt at every man knows / even the licenciouse fraud of
them / which to nourissh theirown private filthy lucre and Gyltye the lordis
body and blood.
filthyer idyl bellyes / have turned this holy souper / not without a great
mystery celebrated in the evening (which time the apostles ever aftir observed)
and this common communion for many together to receive / into a private (I
wilnot say chorlissh) breakfast / selling it under y^ cloak of their own
merits. And somiche the more gilty of the lordis body and blood ar they / for
that they entreat / handle / and behave themselves so filthely and so cruelly
/ that y^ scripture in every place cries so out agenst them / yt their
indignite and lothely vnworthenes / nether may / nor ought no longer to be
suffered.

Also Chrysostom says yt they are not only gyitye of the blood of Crist /
which in temples by the abuse of holy sacraments seek and Chrysostom homyly.
3^ upon mat.
follow terrene and unlawful lucre co^uerting ye honorable religion into
thoccasion of ungodly merchandise / but also they that bye and sell ye giftis
of god / when they should know it written / That thing freely to be given which
they freely received: Mat. x.
wherefore nedis must they be giltye of ye body of the Lord which inuyte and
compel men / for their giftis in bying and selling / to do that thing which
violateth and subuerteth y^ doctrine and tradicio^ of crist.

And sewerly Ambrose speking of the vnworthey eaters says. Ambrose.
Those men to be unworthy of y^ Lord aftir thapostles mind / which wotherwise
celebrate this mystery / then it was delivered of the Lord: for he may not be
devout and godly which presumes and takes it otherwise then it was given of
the first autour. It would gladly be known what should be answerde unto these
holy fathers / which all with one voice deteste and dampne this violated ryte
and abuse of the sacrament thus deformed / so profanely abused / and popisshly
celebrated / as ye se it this day / which also utterly deny it / yt it is
lawful (Cristis commandment and institucio^ abrogated and despised) to be
turned into y^ doctrynes and decrees of me^. And that thing which was once
done justly according to the scriptures / in all chirches so many years / we
may not suffer it to be altered of men by no autorite of scriptures / by no
example of the old holy doctors / by no just cause / but only for the
filthy lucre and unreasonable giftis of a few hyerlings / to stond still thus
violated / deformed / and profaned. They therefore unworthily eat his flessh
and drink his blood / which thirsting the innocent blood of Cristes pore
church / persecute and sley those good men that speak or write agenst their
blody acts and deadis / of who^ the prophet I say says / Swift ar their feet
to shede blood. ^say. lix.
Nether take they the wordis of the apostle any less flesshly then did the
blody caparnaites take Cristis / when they said / How may this man give us his
flesh to eat? ^o. vi.
It is therefore manifest that these blodye and flesshly eaters and dri^kers
receive Crist with as vnpure hertis and as filthy mouths / as did they that
nailed him to the cross / wounded his body / and gave him gall to drink. Also
it is manifest that the gylte and syn consist not / nor is not committed in the
bodily ^owching of his natural body / but by the contempt and abuse of so
holy a sacrament / As contrary wise / the fruit thereof stondeth not in the
^owching and use of his corporal present body / but in the spiritual
enbrasing thereof by faith whereby the spirit of faith e^eth verily the flessh of
crist and verily drinks his blood.

Aftir this manner sometime me^ were called gilty of the majesty or traitors
which contumeliously despised the glory or dignite of the Romans / And they
called iniurio^se unto y^ emprowr that threwdown his image or rased his picture
/ or any letters from him / which thing was as haynously taken as though they
had laid violent ha^dis upon themprowr himself. Gilty the majesty of the
e^prowr.
And eue^ so ar they verily gilty goddis majesty and traitors to him which
violate and co^tempne the institucion and law of him / and do contrary to yt
thing which he comanded and ordened So ar they gilty ye body and blood of
crist which coming to his table nether with the dew honor unto the lord / nor
with that discipline that the souper requires / nor with the same mind and faith
yt the body and blood is received / prosecute not this mystery instituted of y^
lord / but either neglige^tly little regard it or utterly co^tempne it / as
they were wont which as the Apostle writethe / Crucifye Crist a fresshe in
themselves and set forth the blood of the covenant for a laughing ^tok /
tredi^g it under foot by which they were sanctified / for it is said / That y^
greter the majesty is / y^ greuouser is the syn / and the more is the
indignite and unworthiness committed agenst it. ^acrifiers cru^fyers ^f Crist
^gene.


Also these Jews and ge^tyles ar giltye of the mistik body of Crist which
draw forth and shed the blood of his church / which is eue^ y^ very blood of
Crist: ^nnoce^t ^lobe ^heders
And thus ar the wyked and Ezec. iij.
couetuouse curates called in scripture giltye the blood of Crist which feed
not their flok with the fode of goddis word but famisshe them for hunger. And
they ar innocent of the blood which with all diligence feed Cristis chirch
redeemed with his blood / with the word of God. Act. xx.
And they ar giltye of the body and blood y^ believe not / for so is eting taken
Ezech.iij. where he is commanded to eat the bok. And they are unguilty aftir
Austen y^ eat the flesh and drink y^ blood of the Lord according to Cristis
saying / I am that living bread which am comedown from heaven / whosoever eat of
this bread he shall live ever. Io. vi.


And at last (as it were by ye way) to take away yt carnal sense of the
tra^selemented symbols which the papistik scolemen call transsubstanciacio^ of
the bread and wine / that is to say adnihilacion or naught making of them /
destroying the substance of them both / so yt their remains no more bread nor
wine / aftyr the priest has breathed over them / ye shall know yt the
unworthy receiving consists not in any vtwardnes / so yt any man should so eat
and drink his judgment / but it stands in the inward offense / that is to
went / in sleughful negligence / pride / envy / malice / concupiscence /
couetuousnes / unfaithfulness / wikednes etc. which infidelite with her wyked
fruits taken away / the sacrament brings no hurt with it. For well techeth
the Apostle / Those men to eat worthily that prove and examyn themselves
showing plainly that the well of all indignite and unworthiness depends of the
mind and not of the exterior and vtwarde signs. The unworthiness comes out
of the mind.
And plain it is al thingis to be pure unto the pure / but to the polluted and
infedels there is nothing pure / because their mind is polluted. Tit. i.
And Crist says / That at enters into the mouth defyeleth not the man / but
that at gothe out of the mouth vnpureth him. Mat. xv.
Which thing a non he expowning says / yet understand ye not / that whatsoever
gothe into the mouth desce^deth into the bellye and is cast into the sege?
But the thingis y^ goforth of the mouth come from the heart etc. plainly
teching / the wiked and corrupt mind to be the fowntayne of all impurite. But
contrary wise we read / that to the mind enstructe with faith and knowledge of
the doctrine of Crist these thingis ar pure / which to minds evil taught and
enstructe ar vnpure. To. xiiij
In wine there is no fawte of drunkenes / as nether in meats there is no fawte
of surfaiting / but the mind seking tomich hirown pleasure in eating and
drinking is the autres of the sins / wherefore the interior thi^gis purged /
the exterior must nedis be pure. mat. xxiij


The appul of paradyse byten of Ada^ / had no venom i^ it / but the fowntayn
of evil was the venom cast of the serpent into their minds / and therefore
from thense came the evil / from whence came the venom. yea the set mind to
violate the law of God made them giltye of death ere he did byght or taste of
the appul. For it cannot be but noisome and pestelent what so ever owr mind
enbrace at the persuasion of the devil. The morsel of bread was venom and
poison unto Judas says Austen / not that the bread in it self was venom or
hurtful / but because he himself being evil / wykedly used so great and holy a
sacrament.

Praise the Lord.
