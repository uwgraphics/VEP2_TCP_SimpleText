A confutacion of that treatise / which one John Standish made against the
protestacion of D. Barnes in the year. M. D. XL.

Wherein / the holy scriptures (perverted and wrested in his said treatise) are
restored to their own true understanding again by Miles Couerdale.

Iacobi iij. Nolite gloriari, and mendaces esse aduersus ueritatem.

To the Reader. To all them that either read or hear gods holy word / and
give over them selves to live vnfannedly acording to the same / do I heartily
wysshe the grace / peace and mercy of god the father in and through our lord
and only Savior Jesus Christ.
THe seventh day of Decembre / was delivered unto me a certain treatise /
composed by one John Standish Fellow of Whittington college in london (so is the
title of it) and prynted by Robert Redeman / Anno M. D. XL. iij. Nonas
Octobris. At the reading whereof I mourned sore within my self for certain
occasions offered unto me in the sand treatise. First that under the Kings
privilege any thing should be set forth / which is either against the word and
truth of allmightye god / or against the Kings honor. Secondlye / that good
/ wholesome / and Christen words should be calumpniated and reuyled. Thirdly /
that the said John Standish pronouncyng Doctoure Barnes to have taught heresye
so long / is not ashamed all this while to have hold his pen / but now first
to write against him / when he is deed. et ce.

As touching the first / whether I have cause to mourn or no / I report me to
all true Christen hertes. for (as I am credibly enfourmed / Diuersyte among
writers.
and as I partly have seen) there is now a wonderful diversity in writing books
and balates in England / one enueyenge against another / one reuylinge and
reprouyng another / one reioysinge at another fall and aduersite. And not
only this / but also at the end of every balate or book in manner (whether it
be the better party or worse) is set the Kings privilege. Which as it is
against the glory of god that one should reuyle another / Is it not even so
against the Kings honor (Ye the shame is it of all England) that under his
privilege any erroneous / contentious / or slanderous book or papyre should
be prynted? Men wonder in other contrees / that there is so great negligence of
this matter / in a realm where so wise and prudent a counsel is* And they
that are moved with godly compassion / do lament England. sorry / that there is
so great discencion in it. Tryfles are prynted with the Kings privilege /
unknowing to him.
sorry / that blasphemous ieasting / and raylinge balates or books against the
manifest word of god / should either be suffered or priuilegied. sorry / that
gods truth should thus spitefully be entreated of so great a nombre. Now the
reformacion of this and all other defaultes lies only in the hand of god /
To whom I refer it / and to the rightful admynistracion of his holy
ordinance and auctorite in the kings highness. who / when he knows of the
said inconvenience (how tryflinge and raylinge books and rymes are prynted
under his privilege) will no doubt set a redress herein.

Concerning the second occasion above rehearced Is it not cause enough form
and all other Christen / to be right sorry / to mourn and lamente / that the
words which are good / wholesome / and acordinge to the holy scripture and
Chrisies faith / should be either blasphemed or taken to the worst? If the
Kings grace / should put forth an wholesome proclamacion / iniunction or
commandment (as he does many) what true subject loving gods holy ordinance
and auctorite in his prince / would not be grieve to se any man either spytt at
those his sovereigns words / or to defye them? If we now which are Christen /
have so just occsion (and are bownde) to be thus wise minded in this outward
regiment / wherein god has appointed us to be obedient to the hyer powers /
how much more cause have we to water our eyes with sorry hertes / when the
proclamacion / iniunction / Good words are blasphemed.
commandment and word of him which is king of all Kings and lord of all
lords / is thus reuyled and evil spoken of? That the words of. D. Barnes
spoken at tbe hour of his death / and here under written / are good / wholesome
/ acording to gods holy scripture / and not worthy to be evil taken / It
shall be evidently seen / when we have laid the^ to the twych stone / and tried
them by gods word. To the open text whereof if ye take good head / ye shall se
the perverse doctrine and wicked opynions of Standish clearly confuted. And (no
doubt) god will so have it / because that under the pretense of bearing a
zeal toward gods word / he takes upon him to be judge and geuer of sentence
against gods word / and to condemn it that gods word aloweth.

And this (as I said) is another cause of the sorynesse of my heart / that he
which darre auowe another man to be an open heretic / is not ashamed thus
long nether to have written / ner openly preached against him by name / but
now to starte up when he is deed. Is it not a great worship for him to
wrestle with a shadow / and to ^^ll a deed man? Is he not a worthy souldyer
that all the battayll time thrusts his hand in his bosom / St^ndish (...)
^yll a deed man.
and when me^ are deed / then draws out his sword / and fights with them
that are slain allreadye? Judge ye (gentle readers) if Standish plays not
such a part with D. Barnes / To whom also he imputes treason / and yet
proves never a point thereof against him. Yet were it as charitable a deed to
confute all treason and to give us warning of it by name / as either to
establishe false doctrine / or to enueye against good sayenges. Ye a Christen
and charitable act were it in reprouyng any traytoure / to tell the Kings
subjects in what thing he committed the treason / that they may beware of the
same. But thus does not Standishe here in this his treatise / which because it
is builded on sand and on a false foundacio^ / I doubt not / but with gods
word (which is the sword of the sprete / Ephe. vj.
and a weapen mighty / to overthrow every ymaginacion that exalts it self
against the knowledge of god) To give it a fall / ij. Corin. x.
and with holy scripture to show euydently / that Standishe has far
ouershott himself / in condemnynge the sayenges which gods word does not
disalowe. He that would write against any man / should level his ordinance
against his evil words (if he had spoken or written any) and not against his
good words. ffor god is the authoure of all good / which as his holy scripture
aloweth / so will he himself defend the same. He that is therefore an enemy
to the thing which is good / or resists it / is gods adversary / and
withstondeth him. Wherefore let Standish from hensforth and all other beware /
Let no man take part against the truth.
that they take no part against gods word / ner defend any false matter /
lest god be the auenger. ffor if the lion begin to roar / he will make all
his enemies afraid.

And if. D. Barnes dyed a true Christen man / be ye sure / his death shall be a
greater stroke to ypocrisye / then ever his life could have been. If he was
falsely accused to the Kings highness / and so put to death / woo shall come
to those accusers / if they repent not by times. And if D. Barnes in his heart /
mouth and deed / committed no worse thing toward the Kings highness / then
he committed against god in these his words at his death / he is like at the
later day to be a judge over them / that were cause of his death if they do
not amend.

Now (indifferent reader) to the intent that thou may the more clearly /
discern light from darkness / and know gods true word from false docrine /
I shall (when I have said somewhat to Standish preface) rehearce unto the. D.
Barnes words. Secondly though I rehearce not unto the all Standish words
(lest I should make to great a book) I shall point the to the beginning of his
sentence / requyring the (if thou will) to read out the rest thy self in his
treatise. Thirdly though he has desserued to be roughly handled / yet do I
purpose (by gods only grace) to deal more gently with him being alive / then
he does with the deed. This interpryse now as I take in hand against Standishe
in this behalf / so am I ready to do the same against the great graundsire
and captain of false teachers / I mean great Goliath of Rome and his
weapen-bearer. That is / against all such as are enemies to King David our
lord Jesus Christ / for whose most confortable sprete (gentle reader) I
beseech the to pray with me unto our most dear father in heaven / whose name
be praysid / whose kingdom come / whose only will be fulfilled now and ever
Amen.

Here Follows the Preface of John Standish to the reader.
Standish. TO se the most victoryous and noble Prince our sovereign lord the
king / labourynge and watchinge contynually with all diligent study / to
expulse and drive out / I may say / to pourge and cleanse this his catholic
regyon / etce.


Couerdale Though ye abuse your terms in reporting that the King goes about
to expel and drive out his catholic region / I will impute those your words
to the weakness of your brain / and to the seacenesse of honest eloquence
therein. But if the Kings labor / watching / and diligent study in pourging
and clensyng his realm from all heresies and scismes / be occasion sufficient
(as it is in deed) to compel every true subject to help unto the same / why
have ye then been so slack therein all this while? Your own words bring yo in
to a shrewd suspicion. For ye know and have seen with your eyes / Suspicion.
that the king has these many years been laboring and busy in abolishing
out of his realm the usurped power of the. B. of Rome / his manifold sects
of false religions / his worshipping of images / his disceatfull pardons / his
ydolatrye and pilgremages / etc. Were not all these / great heresies and
scismes? Or can ye excuse your self of ignorance / that ye have not seen /
how the King has labored in putting down the same? If ye then be a writer
against heresies and scismes / why have ye written against none of these all
this while? Thus every man which reads your words / may se / that ye have
bewraied your self to be a favorer of such things.


Standish. Wherefore / maruayll not (gentle reader) etc.


Couerdale. Contrary now to your request / will every man maruail at you / not
only because ye declare your self to have borne (all this while) no right
love toward gods word / to the salvation of men's souls / ner to the duty
that ye owe to your prince / but also because that now through the occasion of a
poor man's deeth / ye first starte up to write / as though the King had put
down no heresies before. D. Barnes dyed. Is this the zele that ye bear toward
gods word and toward his people? Such a zele had they / of whom the Apostle
speaks to the Galathians / saying / Gala. ^iij.
They have no good zele unto you / but would thrust you out (namely from the
truth) that ye might be fervent to them ward. Where as ye write the day and
year of. D. Barnes death / it increases your own confusion / and shall be a
clear testimonye against your self / for resistinge those good words of his
protestacion / if ye forsake not your heresye in time. Ye even by your own
pen have ye brought it to pas / that it shall not be forgotten till the
worlds end / what a Christen testament and last will. D. Barnes made at his
death / and how patiently he forsook this life.


Standish. FOr in his protestacion / is both contained heresye and treason.


Couerdale. For (say ye) in his protestacio^ / et cet. Is that the cause why
ye do enterprise and take in hand to write against it? Then verily declare ye
your self not only to be parcial / but also a favorer of heresye and
treason / knowinge so many to have been attaynted thereof within these seven
years.


Standish. ALlbeit / do not think / that I write this through any malice
toward him that is burned etc.


Couerdale. He that compares your words to your deed / shall soon perceive
/ that ye have cast milk in your own face / and that (for all your holy
pretense) some spice of Cainish stomach has made you now do more / then all
the Kings noble acts in abolishinge the said abuses / could make you do
many years before / though the same (if ye were a true subject) were by your
own confession / sufficient cause for you so to do. Howbeit it is not I that
go about to lay malice to your charge / your own act is not your best
friend / I pray god your conscience accuse you not thereof.

But why take ye god to record in a false matter? Do ye not confess yourselfe
/ that the Kings graces labor / watchinge and diligent study is the thing
that causes and compels you to write against. D. Barnes protestacion / and
that through the love and fervent zele ye bear toward gods word and the
salvation of men's souls? et cete. And now take ye god to record / Standish is
afraid.
that ye do it for fear / lest the people schulde be infecte (...) the
multitude of copies of the said protestacion. Against the which fear I know
none other comfort for you (as long as ye will not harken unto gods word)
but that wisdom it self gives you in Salomons Proverbs. Prouer. j.
Namely / that the thing which ye fear / shall come upon you / and even it that
ye are afraid of / shall fall in suddenly among you. This am I certified of /
not only by the same place of scripture / but even by this your present act
in putting forth your treatise to be printed with and against the said
protestacio^. For if ye fear the great infection of the people through the
multitude of copies thereof / why caused ye it to be printed / or any man else
for you? Is the printing of the said protestacion the next way to keep
copies thereof from the people? Ye may well have wit / but sure ye lack
policy Such a like wise way was taken in England within these few years by
certain abbottes / which thinkyng thereby to uphold their false religions /
The enemies (...) word (...) against them selves.
wrought / moved / or else consented to insurrection within diverse parties of
the realm / And yet was the same their wisdom / a cause that haisted their
own destruction. And even so now by your printinge of the said protestacio^
/ ye have brought it so to pas / that the thing which ye feared / is come to
light. Thus can god pull down his enemies houses with their own hondes.
Certainly like as I never heard that there was any copy thereof / till I saw
it in your book / so am I credibly enfourmed / that it was never in printe
before.

Where as ye say / that it is an erroneous and traitorous protestacio^ / it is
sooner said / then proved / nether makes it greatly for your honesty / to
know many secret embracers of heresy and treason / and not to utter them.
But ye may twice say it / before ye be ones believed / only they that are of
god / will when they have tried and examined al things / keep that which is
good / and eschuethe contrary.


Standish. But I trust in almighty god / if it please you to read this little
treatise with a loving zele toward our mother the holy church / et cetera.


Couerdale. Here do ye manifestly declare / what zele moved you to write
against. D. Barnes protestacion / Namely / not any just zele or love toward
gods word / or his people / but even because / ye fear / lest your mother
should come to shame / if the truth were known / therefore to show your
mother a pleasure / ye thought to do your best in defending her. Nether
helps it your pretense any thing at all / though ye call her holy / All is
not gold that shyneth.
for every such sect as ye be of / has a sundry holiness / which comes
not of the sprete that sanctifies. Now like as your own act came of that
zele which ye bear toward the church of the wicked / so would ye have your
treatise red with the same zele / to the intent that the readers might smell
heresy and treason / where none is / and be poisoned with such a corrupt
judgment / as ye be of your self.

Again / how are ye (or all men lyuinge) able to prove / that this
protestacion of. D. Barnes does smell and sauoure nothing but heresy and
treason? Is it heresy and treason to teach no erroneous doctrine / to teach
only those things that scripture leads unto / to manteyne no error / to
move no insurrection / to be falsely slaundred / to confute the false opinion of
the Anabaptists / to deteste and abhor all such sects / Standish smells
here nothing but heresy and treason.
to set forth the glory of god / obedience to the hyer powers / and the true
religion of Christ? Does it smell and sauoure nothing but heresy and treason
to believe in the holy and blessed trenite / to believe the incarnacion / passion
/ death and resurrection of our lord and savior Jesus Christ? Is it heresye
and treason for a sinner to desire god to forgive him / to trust only in the
death of Christ / to set forth good works / to believe that there is a holy
church / to believe a life after this / to speak reverently of saints / to
call our lady a virgin immaculate and undefiled / to knowledge a Christen
believe concerning the body and blood of our lord / to ascribe unto saints
the honor that scripture wills them to have / to pray for the King and his
counsel / et cete. Do such things smell and sauoure nothing but heresy and
treason? Woe unto the^ that call good evil / Esa. v.
and evil good darkness light / and light darkness / sweet sower / and sower
sweet.

Though ye do also esteem them to be heretics and traitors / that take part
with. D. Barnes protestacion / yet does not your estimacion or judgment
discorage me in this behalf. Nether is it my mind or will to meddle with his
offense / (if he committed any against the King) nether to defend this his
protestacio^ with any hand or weapen of man / but by the scriptures to bear
record unto the truth / and to reprove your perverse and strange doctrine /
which ye do teach against the same.


Standish. FOr surely such as do improve them et cete.


Couerdale. This your saienge proves not the contrary / but that saying ye
resist the truth / I may tell you your fault / ij. Tim. ij.
and enfourme you better (acording to the Apostles doctrine) if god at any time
will grant you repentance for to know the truth / and to turn from the
snare of the deuell / et cete. If I can understand / that through this
enfourmacion ye will give place to the open and manifest truth / godschall
have the praise / and I shall think my labor well bestowed. If the truth
can have no place in you by fair means / but he will still resist it
obstinately / and belie it / as ye do here in this your treatise / then verily
ye may be sure to be afterward so handled / as the lymites and bounds of gods
holy scripture will suffer. I beseech god (acordinge to his good pleasure) that
ye may have eyes to se / ears to hear / and an heart to understand his holy
word / to consent unto the same / and in all points to live thereafter. Amen.


Here follows the protestacion of S. Robert Barnes.
Barnes. I Am come hither to be burned as an heretic / and you shall hear my
belefe / whereby ye shall perceive what erroneous opynions I hold.


Standishe. I am sorry to se the obstinate blindness and final induracion in
this his protestacion / which would clear / justify / and excuse himself by
color and disceate.


Couerdale. Christ our savior making mention of his own death / before he
was hanged upon the cross / said these words / Matthew. xx.
Behold / we go up to Jerusalem / and the son of man shall be betrayed /
condemned / mocked / scourged / crucified. et cetera. When a true man comes
to be hanged on the galowes / Is it obstinate blindness and final induracion
for him so to say? Peradventure ye will say unto me / Take ye. D. Barnes then
for a true man? I answer / Verily these his words prove him no false man /
for he said that he came to be brent / And sure I am / that he came not to the
fire to be made a bisshoppe.

Morouer. D. Barnes told the people / that they should hear his believe / et
cet. And ye lay to his charge for his so doing / that he would clear /
justify / and excuse himself with color and disceate. As though he
justified himself with color and disceate / j. Pet. iij.
which (acordinge to. S. Peter's doctrine) is ready allwaie to give answer unto
every man / that asks him a reason of the hope which is in him. Was not. D.
Barnes instantly required to show his faith and to open his mind in sondrie
things? Again / though he or any man else would clear himfelse from such
things as are wrongfully laid to his charge / Act. xxiij.xxiiij.xxv.
did he evil therein? If it be so / then did holy. S. Paul leave us a shrewd
ensample in the Acts.


Standishe. Which ought to have accused / condemned / and utterly forsaken all
that he had offended in / si nos ipsos iudicaremus / non utique diiudicaremur a
domino. j. Cor. xj



Couerdale. I answer / By your own words / then it follows not / that he
was bound to accuse and condemn himself of the things that he had not
offended in. But by your leave / where as ye bring in this text of. S. Paul (Si
nos ipsos et cetera.) ye peruerte it / not alledginge it as it stands / but
thus / Si nos ipsos iudicaremus / non vtique diiudicaremur a Domino. That is to
say / If we judged our selves / we should not be judged of the lord. But. S
/ Paul's words are these / Quod si nos ipsos diiudicaremus / non vtique
iudicaremur. Dum iudicamur autem / a Domino corripimur / ne cum hoc mundo
damnemur. Standish peruerteth the text.
That is to say / If we would judge (or reprove) our selves / we should not
be judged. But when we are judged / we are chastened of the lord / lest we
should be damned with this world. Wherefore the perverting of this text now at
the first bront / causes me the more to suspecte you / and to trust you the
worse / because the deuell himself is scolemaster to such chopping up of the
text / As we may se in the gospel of Matthew and Luke. Math. iiij Luc. iiij.
out of the xc. Psalm.
Now go to / If I find any moo such iugling castes with you / ye are like to
hear of it / before I come to the end of your book. For weakness and
ignorance can I well away withal (so long as it is not wilful) but the
perverting or choppinge up of a text of holy scripture / is not to be borne
unrebuked


Standishe. Mark here / how he uses Ironia / et cetera.


Couerdale. Ye confess / that. D. Barnes in his forsaide words does use
ironia / and yet (contrary to the significacion of the word) ye are not
ashamed to affirm / that he confessed herewithall both heresy and erroneous
opinions. (...)
Now is ironia as much to say as a mockage / derision / or meaning of another
thing / then is expressed in the words. Which manner of speaking is much used
not only through out the Prophets in holy scripture but also among the Heithen
Poets. And the same phrase of speech have we in Englische / As / when a man
says to ashrewde boie / Come hither good sir / ye are a virtuous child in
deed / et cete. meaning nothing less. For as much then as ye your self
confess / that. D. Barnes does here use ironia / it is evident / that when he
said these words (You shall perceive what erroneous opynions I hold) his
meaning was / how that the people should know / that he held no erroneous
opinions / As it appears by these his words folowinge.


Barnes. GOd I take to record / I never (to my knowledge) taught any erroneous
doctrine / but only those things which scripture led me unto.


Standishe. Justly pondre by the Prophet Psalm. cxl. how grievous offense is
partinax excusatio in peccatis / et cet.


Couerdale. Like as ye can not justly lay any partinacite to. D. Barnes for
those his words / Genesis xiiij. Romans j.ij. Cor. j.ij. Cor. xj. Gal. j. Iudic. xj.
so prove ye the greuousnesse thereof full slenderly out of the cxl. Psalm / if
the true readinge of the text be well and justly pondred. Where as he takes god
to record in the truth of so waightye a matter / the scripture is full of
holy ensamples / that bear him therein. What partinacite is there then in that
act?

He durst avowe also / that (to his knowledge) he never taught any erroneous
doctrine / and yet are ye not ashamed to ascrybe partinacite unto him / and to
call him an obstinate heretic / where as. Who is an heretic.
S. Hierome in his fourth book the xxiiij. chapter upon Matthew writes thus. He
is an heretic that under Christ's name teaches the things which are against
Christ. If. D. Barnes therefore had wittingly and willingy taught any thing
against Christ / ye might have laid great partinacite to his charge. Truth it
is / that he being in ignorance / and disceaued sometime by a multitude as you
be / did both err and teach erroneous doctrine for the preferrement of the. B.
of Romes usurped auctorite and other abuses / acording as many other learned men
moo in the realm have done / (which have sens both repented toward god / and
also received the Kings gracious pardon) many years agoo. Again / if ye will
lay partinacite to his charge because he was sometime in such gross ignorance
/ Mar. vj.ix. Luc. ij.ix.xviij. John* xvj.
by the same argument might ye condemn Christ's disciples / of whose
ignorance mention is made in many places of the new Testament. I say not this
to excuse ignorance / but to reprehende the rashness of your judgment /
which presume to condemn them who^ god has called to repentance.

But peradventure the pertinacite that ye lay to his charge / is because he
says he taught only those things which scripture led him unto. For that is
no small corsie to your sore. Ye would not have scripture taught only without
other doctrines. Deuteronomy. xij. Mat. xxviij Gal. j.ij. John. j. Hiere. xv. Matthew. v
Nevertheless they that love gods commandment / will teach nothing but his
word only / for so has he himself given commission. Of his promises is
mention made both in Hieremie and in the gospel of Matthew. As for ensamples /
we have sufficient both of the Prophets and Apostles / which / to die for it /
ij. Cor. xiij. Romans xv.
would teach nothing but scripture. Read the thirte^th chapter of the second
Epistle to the Corinthians / the fiftenth to the Romans / and the most godly
protestacion that. S. Peter makes in his second Epistle. ij. Pet. j.
Let us give place and co^sente to the holy scripture (saieih. S. De peccatorum
meritis et remissione cap. xxij. The bisshoppes of England.
Augustine) for it can nether disceaue / ner be disceaued. The bisshoppes also
and clergy of England in the Epistle of their book to the Kings grace / do
affirm / that holy scripture alone shows men the right path to come to god /
to se him / to know him / to love him / to serve him / and so to serve him /
as he most desires. Wherefore they are rather obstinate against god / which in
stead of his only word / preach and teach other doctrines. But let us hear
what. D. Barnes says more.


Barnes. And that in my sermons I never mayntayned any error / nether moved
ner gave occasion of any insurrection.


Standish. What blyndnesse would he lead us in to? Who has not heard him
preach against all the ordinance of Christ's church? et cete.


Couerdale. As for blindness / ye need no leader to bring you in to it / our
lord (when his will is) bring you out of it. This man took god to record /
that he never maintained any error / Whereby like as he denied not but that
he might err (as he did err grossly / when he lived in the Papistry) even so
left he us an ensample / A good ensample in. D Barnes.
to forsake all errors / and to maynteyne none. Call ye this a leadinge in to
blyndnesse? Then farewell all good ensamples of humilite and repentance.

To the other part of your cauillacion I answer. It would be to long a
registre for you to rehearce the names of all those / which never heard. D,
Barnes preach against the ordinance of Christ's church. I also am one of them
/ which have heard him as often as ever did ye / and yet (as I hope to have my
part of gods mercy in Christ's blood) I never heard him preach against any
such / sens he was converted first from the wicked Papistrie. Against some of
the ordinances or ceremonies used in your church / have I heard him preach
often and many times. As for you ye are none of Christ's church / Standish
writes him self to be none of Christ's church.
by your own saying. For herafter in your treatise ye confess your self /
that the congregation of Christ's church in this region of England / is the
Kings Majesty with his learned counsel. And truly like as I am sure that ye
are not King of England / so do I perceive by your writing / that ye are none
of the Kings learned counsel / And so (by your own confession) none of
Christ's church. The ordinance of Christ's church is / that every one (from
the prince to the lowest subject) shall be diligent to wait upon his office /
and to do the thing that god has called him unto. To the ordinance of
Christ's church pertains all that is written concerning the dewtie of every
estate / and also concerning such order as is mete to be kept in the church /
acordinge to the doctrine of the Apostle.j. Cor. xiiij. j. Cor. xj. Did you
ever now hear. D. Barnes preach against any such holy ordinance of god or of
his church? No verily I suppose. For then doutlesse we should have heard of it
in this your thondringe treatise.

Where as. D. Barnes now has kene erneste against your wicked church of the
Papistrie / and preached against the horrible abuses thereof / call ye that
erroneous railinge and traitorous speaking? By that reason were the Prophets
erroneous raylers / which rebuked the abuses of the Jews church so ernestly.
Esa. j.lviij.lxvj. Zac. vij Amos. v.viij. Mal. ij Gala. iiij. Collo. ij. Esa.
lviij Matthew. vj. j. Cor. vij.
Ye and against the supersticious observing of fasting days / did the
Prophets preach / as did also the Apostle. S. Paul. All these and many other
moo of gods servants did speak against supersticious observing of vain
fastes / and against the abusinge of that fast which god had commanded. But
against true fasting / whereof mention is made in many places of holy scripture
/ have not ye yet proved that. D. Barnes did ever preach in his sermons /
nether against such days as by lauful auctorite are appointed without
supersticion for general fastinges.

If ye will blame him for preaching against the abuse of prayer / why do ye not
also blame the Prophet Esaye / Esa. j. Matthew. vj.xxiij. Iaco..j iiij.
our sauyoure Christ himself / the Apostle. S. James / S. Ambrose / Gregory /
Barnard / Chrysostom / Hierome. Cirillus / Fulgentius / Origin / et cet. Can
ye say now / that ye have justly blamed. D. Barnes in this behalf? But
thanks be unto god / against the right use of prayer (whereof mention is made
by our savior and his Apostles through out the new Testament) have ye not yet
proved / that. D. Barnes at any time did preach / sens he forsook the Papistrie
/ nether against such laufull days as by just auctorite are appointed for
general prayers and thankesgeuynges to god / and for the acco^plishinge of
other spiritual exercyses grounded upon gods word.

Nevertheless / I maruayll the less that ye blame him unworthy in this point /
for ye are not ashamed also to belie him / and to report of him / that he
denied godly ordinance to bind unto deedly sin / contrary to. S. Paul
Roman. xiij. Godly ordinance.
which chapter with the contents thereof he defended in his sermons and
writings very ernestly / and diligently set forth due obedience to the hyer
powers / to the great hynderaunce of ypocrites and their wicked church / whose
ordinance he denied utterly to bind unto deedly sin / because it is not
grounded on gods word. But godly ordenaunce / that is to say / the ordinance
and institucion of god / did not he deny / but that the breakers and offenders
thereof do commit deedly sin. As for man's ordinance (not institute of god /
ner justly grounded upon his word) what Christen man / having wit to
discern between chalk and chese / will say or grant (except it be such
wavering redes as fear man more then god) that it byndeth unto deedly sin /
saying it is sinful / wicked / and abominable it self / Esa. xxix. Matthew.
xv.xxiij. Marck vij. Col. ij. Gal. iiij.j. Timo. ^iij.
invented by Satan / and repugnaunt unto gods word? Is not such stuff most
vehemently rebuked by gods own mouth / and also by his holy Apostle? Are ye
not ashamed then to affirm / that man of his auctorite may restrain the
things which are fre by the gospel? May a man bind that god lowseth /
condemn that god saves / or hold him in preson whom god delivers? Is man
stronger then god / or man's auctorite above the auctorite of god? Or be they
both alyke?

Where as ye say / that it is the church which has this auctorite / to
restrain the things that are fre by the gospel / I answer / The church of
Cyrist is his spouse / and the fold of those sheep that harken to his voice /
unto his voice (I say) and not unto the voice of strangers. He him self also
sendinge out his Apostles / bids them teach all that he has commanded them
/ and not to bind that he has made fre / nether to make fre that he has
bownd. Again / the nature and condition of an honest wife / is / to harken to
the wholesome words of her husband / to prefer his commandment / and to se
tyat his household folks keep it. A strompet (in deed) and an harlot / cares
not to controlle her husband / to disobeye him / and to maynteyne evil rule
in his house against his mind. That church therefore which takes upon her any
such auctorite as is not given her by Cyrist / is not his laufull spouse /
nether can ye prove that he has given your church any power to restrain the
things which he has made fre / except ye do it with the words of. S. James
that says / Iaco. iiij.
There is one lawgeuer / which is able to destroy and to save / Or else with
the words of. S. Paul that asks the Collossians this question / Collo. ij.
If ye be deed with Christ from the ordinances of the world / why are ye
holden then with such traditions / as though ye lived after the world? etc.


Standishe. Who has not heard him preach a carnal liberty with a damnable
iustificacion of only faith to justify? et cete.


Couerdale. Truly it would make your headeake / to read all the names of them
/ that never heard. D. Barnes preach any such unlawful liberty as you speak
of. But first I pray you / what carnal or fleshly lybertye does he preach /
that exhorts men with well doing to put to silence the ignorance of foolish
men / as fre / j. Pet. ij.
and not as having the liberty for a cloak of wickedness? How often has he
taught this doctrine / as they that have heard him can tell / if they be not
either malicious or else forgetful? Who can justly deny / but he often and many
times (upon due occasion in his wrytinges and sermons) did exhort his hearers
/ Romans viij.xiij.
that they would not live after the flesh / ner accomplish the lusts thereof /
but to cast away the works of dacknesse / to put on the armoure of light /
to walk honestly in the light that god has given them / Romans xiiij.
to follow such things as pertain to peace / and things where by one may
edifye another / to walk every man in his calling / j. Cor. vij.x ij. Cor. vj
Col. iij
to give no occasion of fallinge unto any man / to mortifye their erthly
members / et cet. acording to the wholesome doctrine of the Apostle? Call ye
this a preaching of a fleshly and carnal liberty? Is this a doctrine that
makes men run at ryote / and to do what they list? I wondre verily / that ye
shame not thus to belie the truth so often.

Iustificacio^.
As pertayninge to your blasphemye which say / that it is a damnable
iustificacio^ where faith is preached only to iustifye / it is damnably spoken
of you / ye though an angel of heaven should speak it / Gal. j.
if holy. S. Paul be true which says / he ought to be holden accursed / that
preaches any other gospel / then that he himself and the other Apostles had
preached. If ye of a cancred hatred to the truth / have not wilfully and
maliciously taken part against the holy ghost / so that ye are but led
ignorauntly by a blind multitude / to affirm the said inconvenience / I pray
god lend you a clearer fight in the Kyngdone of Christ. But if ye be minded as
were the Pharisees / Matthew. xij. Nar. iij. Luc. xj.
and maliciously ascribe damnacion to it / whereby only we receive salvation
(as they ascribed unto the deuell / it that was the only workynge of the holy
ghost) then am I sore afraid for you / and for as many as are of that mind.
For if it be damnable to teach or preach wittingly against the express word
of god / then verily is this a damnable heresye to affirm / that faith only
does not iustifye / seeing that holy scripture so teaches. As Gene. The
scriptures.
xv. Esa. liij. Abac. ij. Mar. xvj. Luc. j.viij.xxiiij. John. v.xvij. Acto.
xiij. xvj^ Romans iij.iiij.v.x. Gal. ij.iij.iiij.v. Philip. iij.j. Pet. j.ij Heb.
iiij.xj. Of this faith that scripture speaks of so plentifully / have I made
sufficient mention in the prologe of that little book which I lately put forth
in Englische / concerning the true old faith of Christ. Now like as the
scriptures before alleged / do testifye for us / that we mean no false ner
vain faith / even so is the same article of iustificacion defended and
maynteyned by the doctous in many and sondrye places / specially by. S.
Augustine in the ccclij. chapter de vera innocentia. De verbis Domini
sermon.xl. De verbis Apostoli ser. xxvij. In the book of the fiftye sermons /
the xvij. sermon / In the first book of the retractes the xxiij. chapter / the
doctors
In the cv. Epistle unto Sixtus the bisshoppe / In the xxv treatise upon John
the sixte chapter / In his manualle the xxij and xxiij chapter / In the
exposicion of the lxvij and of the lxx Psalm / In the liij sermon de tempore /
In the v book of his homelis the xvij homelye / In the book of the lxxxiij
questions the lxvj chapter / And in the prologe of the xxxj Psalm / I might
allege Cyrillus / Ambrose / Origin / Hilarious / Bernarde / Athanasius / with
other moo / but what helps it? Yet shall all the world know / that your
heresye is not only condemned by the open and manifest scripture / but also by
many of the doctors. As for natural reason / it fights clearly against you
also / Natural reason.
if ye pondre well the parable of the marriage in the xxij. of Matthew / and in
the xiiij. of luke / the parable of the unthrifty son in the xv. of Luke /
the parable also of the detter in the xviij. o^ Matthew and in the seventh of
Luke.

God is not the author of sin.
Where as it was laid to. D. Barnes charge / how that he should teach that god
is the author of sin / verily he protested openly at. S. Mary spitle the
tewesdaye in easter weke / that he was never of that mind / howbeit he
confessed (as the truth is) that where as in his book he had written of
predestinacion and fre will / there was occasion taken of him by his writynge /
that he should so mean. But verily if he had in that matter been as
circu^specte / as the children of this world are wise in their generation / he
might the better have avoided the capciousnesse of men before hand. Nevertheless
it appears planely that he mistrusted no such thing / and therefore did to
much simplicite disceaue him in that behalf / as it does many moo / which are
not so wise as serpents. Nether find ye in all his book these words (God is
the authoure of sin) but ye may find these words / The gouerner of al
things is most wise / D. Barnes words.
most rightous / and most merciful / and so wise / that nothing that he does
/ can be amended / so righteous / that there can be no suspicion in him of
unrighteousness / et cet* Item All thing that he does / is well done. Wh^^fore
if they that laid that heresye to. D. Barnes charge / had remembered their own
distinction (of malum pene and malum culpe) at the reading of his words /
as well as they can note it in other places / they might easily have perceived
his meaning / and not have mistaken him.

Ye say also. D. Works.
Barnes did preach that works do not profit. If ye mean works invented by
men's own brains / not grounded on gods word / then verily might he well say
/ that such works do not profit to salvation. Romans xiiij.
For what soever is not of faith / is sin. But if ye mean such good works
as are comprehended in the commandments of god / Osie. xij
and within the precyncte of his word / then truly ye fail so to report of
him / for though salvation be gods work only yet. D. Barnes in his book does
not only condemn the fleshly and damnable reason of them / which say / If
faith only justifies / what need we to do any good works? et cet. But also
he affirms planely / that we must needs do them / and that they which will
not do the^ because they be justified alonely by faith / are not the children
of god ner childrne of iustificacion / et ce. For if they were the very true
children of god / they would be the gladder to do good works / et cet. D.
Barnes words.
Therefore (says he) should they also be moved freely to work / if it were for
none other purpose ner profit / but only to do the will of their merciful god
that has s^^^ely justified them / and also to profit their neighbor / who^
they are bound to serve of very true charity. Are these words now as much to
say / as works do not profit? Lord god / what mean ye / thus untruly to
report of the deed?

I fond objection against the iustificacion of faith.
Where as ye make this blind objection and say / of works profit not / so
that faith only justifies / and Christ's death be sufficient / then pen^aunce
is void and superfluous / I answer A goodly consequent / gathered nether of
wittye sophistry / wise logyek / ner of good Philosophy / (except it be of
Philosophy unnatural) no ner of right diuynite. Works profit not to salvation
ergo they profit nothing at all / Is this a praty consequent? Your consequent
is naught / says. S. lj. Pet. j.
Peter / for by good works must ye make your vocacion certain and sure. Alike
argument might ye make after this manner / and say / Iron is not profitable to
chew or to eat / ergo it is nothing worth. were not this a wise consequent?
The smyth will tell you a better tail.

Peradventure ye will excuse your self / and say / This consequent is not
mine / but Barnes words. I answer. Yes verily / they be your own words /
for ye say planely afterward in your treatise / If Christ had delivered us
from all pain satisfactory / et ce.? we should nether mourn ner be penitent for
our offense committed against god / nether need we to mortifye our flesh. This
your fleshly and damnable reason / this your heresye / this foul stinckyng
opinion / this pestilent error and spiritual poison / Did. Barnes utterly
abhor / and condemned it by. S. Paul's own words / in the xlix leaf of his
book. So that the more I look upon your words / the mote I wonder at your
shameless slaundring of the truth. But as touching this / I shall have more
occasion to talk with you afterward.

Now to put you to your probacion. How are ye able justly to prove / that
pennaunce is void and superfluous / where faith is preached only to justify?
the true faith of Christ / Gal. v.
is it that we speak of. Is it not occupied then / and works through godly
love and charity? They then that duly receive this faith / do not receive it
to live worse or as evil afterward / as they did before god gave it them. For
though we be saved by grace through faith / and that not of our selves / Ephe.
ij.
though it be the gift of god (I say) not of works / Yet are we his
workmanshippe / created in Christ Jesus unto good works / to the which god
ordained us before / that we should walk in the^. Nether has our savior
given us any liberty to receive it in vain / ij. Cor. vj. Tit. ij.
but teaches us to forsake al ungodliness and wordly lusts / and to live
discretely / justly / and godly in this world. Therefore who so despises to
live virtuously / and to do good works / j. Tessa. iiij.
despises not man / but god. The same faith that only justifies / sets
forth this doctrine / therefore does it not destroy good works and pennaunce.
Take you head the^ and beware what ye say another i^ me. I might point you
also to. S. lib. j. cap. v^^
Ambrose / who treatinge of the calling of the heithen / and declaringe the
true origenal of our salvation / alleges the place before rehearced of the ij
to the Ephesians / and shows / that faith goes as it were with child /
being replenished with all good thoughts and deeds / and in due season
brings them forth. De vera et falsa penite^. cap. ij.
And. S. Augustine says these words / If faith be the foundacio^ of
pennaunce / without the which there is nothing that can be good / then is
pennaunce ernestly to be required / which (as it is euydent) is grounded in
faith. For a good tree can not bring forth evil fruits. Matthew. xij. Pennau^ce
therefore which proceadeth not of faith / is not profitable / et ce. These are.
S. Augustines words. Faith then destroieth nether pennaunce ner good works /
but is the womb that bears them both / and of whom they both proceade.

Touching the article of forgiveness / where ye say / that it is contrary to
the order of our Saviors prayer / that we must be forgeuen of god before we
can forgive / are ye not ashamed thus to proceade forth in blasphemies against
the manifest word of god / ye and clearly against your own words? Do ye not
confess your self / that first god of his mercy only gives us grace / with
out which we can do nothing that is good? Is it not a good thing / j. John.
iiij
one man to forgive another? Do ye not grant also / that god first loved us /
ye even when he was not loved of us? Why then shame ye not to write / that it
is against the order of our lords prayer / to be forgeuen of god / before we
can forgive? Is the love of our savior against the order of his prayer? Or
did he not forgive us / when he loved us first? Can he love / and not forgive?
Think ye god to be of the nature of those / which forgive and love not / or
that show tokens and countenance of love in outward appearaunce / and forgive
not in their hertes?

A shame is it for you / to take upon you the office of a teacher / of a reader
/ of a preacher / and to handle such a weighty matter as this is / so
slenderly / so frowardly / so crokedly / so far out of frame / so wide from
the order of Christ's sincere and true doctrine. Red ye never the parable of
forgiveness / Math. xviij
that our savior tells in the eightenth of Matthew? Which parable like as
it sets forth our duty / and teaches us / every one to forgive our
brethrens trespaces from our heart rotes / proves it not likewise / that the
lord first pitieth us / discharges us / and forgeueth us our great debt?
Gal. v.
Is not love and gentleness (that one Christen man owes to another) a fruit
of the holy ghost? Is it not a work of faith then and of the holy ghost (ye a
fruit of that pennaunce which proceadeth of them both) one man to forgive
another? Does not our lord himself say / A new commandment I give you / to
love one another / that eue^ as I have loved you / John. xiij
ye also may love one another? etc. Be ye courteous (says. S. Ephe. iiij
Paul) one to another / merciful / and forgive one another / even as god has
forgiven you in Christ. Item. Col. iij.
Now therefore as the elect of god / holy and beloved / put on tender mercy /
kindness / humbleness of mind / meekness / long sufferinge / forbearing one
another / if any man have a quarrel against another. Even as Christ has
forgeuen you / so do ye also.

Be these scriptures now against the order of our lords prayer? The words
whereof if we rehearce in order as he taught them / Luc. xj. Matthew. vj.
then (before we ask any peticion) we first confess / that almighty god is
our father / and we his children / which we can not be / except he has
granted us forgiveness for Christ's sake. Again / there is no prayer good and
acceptable without faith / for / how shall they call upon him (says. Romans x.
S. Paul) in who^ they have not believed? They therefore that truly say their
Pater noster / Job. iij.vj.xj Mar. xvj.
are faithful beleuers / to whom eternal life is promised by Christ's own
mouth / and have their sins forgiven them of god.

Do ye not considre / that they to who^ our lord taught this prayer / were
his Apostles / and true Christen men? which like as they them selves first have
forgiveness of god (they should never else be Christen men) so use they to
forgive other / ^ob. xiij. Math. xviij Ephe. v
acording to the doctrine of scripture. For the Apostle says / Be ye the
folowers therefore of god / as dear children / and walk in love / eue^ as
Christ loved us / et ce. And what Christen man being in his right wit / did
ever deny / but that if we (which have forgiveness of god) will not forgive
our trespacers / he shall withdraw his forgiveness from us? But you (not
regardinge the order that god has taken in the salvation of his people) turn
the root of the tree upward / draw the threde through before the nedle / set the
cart before the horse. Ye your doctrine will have us to be the fore goers of
god / and not the folowers of him / as scripture byddeth us.


Standishe. A reuocacion of these was red in octauis pasche / et ce.


Couerdale. What reuocacions ye make in men's names (they being absent) I can
not tell. But like as ye come to the sermon to take Christ in his words / so
are ye not to learn to turn the cat in the pan. This may all the world spy
here in you / that as ye are crafty and sotell to bring men to reuocacions /
so are ye malicious in diffaminge of them.


Standishe. Furthermore / read his detestable books / and you shall se what
pestilent sede he has sowid.


Couerdale. If. D. Barnes books be detestable and to be abhorred / why do ye
bid us read the^? Will ye have the kings subjects to read abominable books?

As for the sede which he did sow / I can not greatly maruail at you / that
call it a pestilent sede / for in his book he said these words / D. Barnes
words in the xxxiiij leaf of his book.
When I am deed / the son and the moon / the stars and the eleme^t water
and fire / Ye and also the stones shall defend this cause against them
(meaning the cause of gods word against the spiritualty) sooner then the
veryte should perish / This is one corn of the sede that. D. Barnes did sow.
And verily so far as I can perceive / this same little praiy sede (veryte)
will grow and come up. Ye I may tell you / it will grow in your own garde^s
/ when ye are most against it. ^or Christ told your predecessors planely /
(...) xix.
that if his disciples would not speak / the very stones should cry /
acording to the prophecye of Abacue. (...). ij.
It is no wonder therefore / though he call this a pestilent sede. For pestilent
is as much to say as hurtful or unwholesome / so that if ye suffer this sede of
the verite to grow / it will hurt your false doctrine / and the phisicians
that have seen your water / say / that it is unwholesome for your complexion.


Standish. And therbye you shall perceive / how shamefully now he does lie
(like as he has done ever heretofore)


Couerdale. By. D. Barnes books may every man perceive / that he confesses
the articles of the Christen believe. And if he lied ever here tofore (as you
report of him) then said he never truth. Now is it manifest also / that in
his book to the Kings highness / In the iiij leaf.
he confesses / that no man in England is except from the subjection of the
Kings power / nether bisshoppe ner other. He confesses also / that the Kings
prerogatyue is allowed by gods word. He says like wise in the next leaf /
In the v leaf.
that it is not laufull for the spiritualtye to depose a King. Is not this
truth? Will ye say then that he has lied ever here tofore? Let not the King
ner his counsel here these your words / I will advyse you. Now like as. D.
Barnes spoke truth in these things / so heard I him say to a sort of
malicious enemies of gods word / even the saying of Christ to the wilful
Jews. John. viij.
Ye are of the father the deuell / and after the lusts of your father will ye
do. He was a murthurer from the beginning / and abode not in the truth / for
the truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie / he speaks of his own /
for he is a liar / and father of the same / et ce. Ye will grant these words
to be true / I think.


Standishe. Which would have us here to believe contrary to our hearing and
seeing / that he never taught ner preached heresye / ner erroneous opynions.


Couerdale. To that does. D. Barnes say himself / in his fore rehearced
words / that to his knowledge he never taught any erroneous doctrine. Somewhat
also have I said unto you already concerning this matter.


Standishe. I pray you / what was his own reuocacion / et ce.


Couerdale. Ye make answer to your own question your self. Ye say that he
utterly there forsook many of his old damnable heresies. If (as you say) he
forsook there his old damnable heresies / then did he there as he did in other
his sermons / even showed himself to abhor the heresies of the papistrie /
for those were the old infectio^s that he was tangled withal sometime.


Barnes. ALlthough I have been slaundred to preach that our lady was but a
saffron bagg / which I utterly proteste before god / that I never meant it ner
preached it: but all my study and diligence has been utterly to confound and
confute all men of that doctrine / as are the anabaptists / which deny that
our savior Christ did take any flesh of the blessed virgin Mary / which
sects I deteste and abhor.


Standish. A fond consequent.
Here he clears himself to be no Anabaptist / as though there were no heresy
but that alone.


Couerdale. Ye would be loathe your self / that other men should so understood
your words / or gather such a conseque^t of the^. If ye were accused to be a
preuy these / and came before a multitude to clear your self from that vice
/ would ye me^ should judge you to be therefore of so fond opinion as to think /
that there were no moo vices but theft alone? I doubt not / but if ye were
strately examyned / ye would say / that there were also the vice of lienge /
the vice of malice / of slau^dring / of bacbyting / of frowardness / of
foolishness / of wilfulness / et cet.


Standish. And yet this opinion / to say Christ did pass through the virgins
womb as water through a cundeth / was none of the Anabaptists own opinion. It
was one of the Maniches error and also Eutices error / who^ some of the
Anabaptists herin did follow.


Couerdale. Whose error so ever it was / I refer that to you / for your
treatise declares / that ye be well acquainted with heretics.


Standishe. Therefore. M. Barnes hereby does not pourge himself from the
Anabaptists heresy concerning the baptime of infauntes.


Couerdale. His disputacio^s had often times with the^ / his continual preaching
against the^ / his daily words also and conuersacio^ was record sufficient /
that he abhorred their error also in that behalf. Why / would ye have him
the^ to pourge himself thereof? Your phisike is not good / to give a man a
purgacion / which is not infecte with such evil or gross humors / as require
a purgacion.


Standishe. Here he says / he never gave occasion to insurrecion / But how
say you? Did he not offer himself to cast his glove in defense of his errors
at Paul's cross?


Couerdale. He said at the cross the third sondaie in lent / Here is my
glove / not in defense of any error / (as ye untruly report) nether with
material sword / buckler or spear to defend any such thing / but with the
sword of gods word to prove / that god first forgeueth us / before we can
forgive / and that they be no breakers of order which set forth gods word and
due obedience to their prince / but they that maintain their own tradicions /
burn gods word / and regard not the Kings injunctions / et cet.


Standishe. Did he not openly say / these things (meaning his errors) must
be tried by blood?


Couerdale. Ye are to blame to be so malaperte / as to enter so presumptuously
in to a man's thought / and so to judge it / For his very death declares / that
he meant not to fight / nor to hurt any man's blood / nether to set men
together by the ears for any article of his believe. But that they which are
of the truth / Math. x.xvj
must in the cause thereof suffer their blood to be shed / and be content to
dye for the name of Christ / if they be called there unto.


Standishe^ What call you this / but geuyng occasion of insurrection?


Couerdale. If this be insurrection / Acto. xv
then did the Apostles send out two sedicious men / Paul and Barnabas / for in
their Epistle they testifye of them / that they ioperded their lives for the
name of our lord Jesus Christ. And yet their weapons were not carnal / as.
S. Paul says. ij. Cor. x.
If it be insurrection therefore when a man offreth himself to dye in the cause
of Christ / then did he himself preach insurrection when he said / Math.
x.xvj Mar. viij.
he that loses his life for my sake / shall find it. Whosoever loses his
life for my sake and the gospel / shall save it. I say unto you my friends.
Luc. xij
Be not afraid of them which kill the body / and afterward have no more that
they can do. But I will show you whom ye shall fear / Fear him / which after
he has killed / has power to cast in to hell. Ye I say unto you Fear him.
D. Barnes therefore offeringe himself to dye in the cause of Cyrist and his
gospel / shameth you / and all your affinite (as ye call it) which will not
ioperde to put your little fyngre / where he has suffered his whole body to be
brent for the trial of the truth.


Standishe. He says he never called our lady a saffron bagg / whether the
did or no / I wot not / but I herd him at Barkyn two year and more before he
was burnt in declaring the canticle Magnificat / slanderously speak of her.


Couerdale. Our lady has but a faint friend of you / that hearing one
slaundre her in his sermon / could not find in your heart (by the space of
two year and more) to se him openly rebuked for it / but now like a cowarde /
to stand up when he is deed / and to accuse him / that can not answer for
himself. Verily like as he (what so ever he be) that slaundreth our lady / is
worthy of open punishment to the ensample of other / even so seeing that (by
your own confession) ye heard him slaundre her so long before his death / and
complained not of it / ye make your self giltye of the crime / by the same
text that ye allege out of the Romans in the later end of your preface.
Romans j.
Nether can I believe / that any of the Kings counsel hearing of any such
inconvenience / and having sufficient proof thereof / would differ the
punishment solonge.


Standishe. Making her no better then another woman* et cetera.


Couerdale. In deed it was not. D. Barnes ner any other creature that made her
better then other women / but even the holy and blessed trenite / whose good
pleasure it was / to chose her before all other / to be the worthy mother of
our savior Jesus Christ in whom all faithful should be blessed. But if ye
say that he in his sermons reputed her no better then another woman / then
declare ye your self to be a very malicious slaunderer of the deed / against
whom like as ye prove nothing / so were not only his sermons gathered at his
mouth in wrytinge / but also the learned me^ that heard him preach and were then
present at Barkyng / do testify and report / that in their life they never
heard man speak more reverently of the blessed virgyn Mary / then he did in
that place.


Barnes. ANd in deed in this place there has been burnt some of them / whom I
never favored ner mainteyned.


Standishe^ Here he says / that he does deteste and abhor some that has
been burnyd in Smythfelde / whereby we man se / that in all things heretics do
not agree among them selves / et cet.


Couerdale. By the same collectio^ should ye have inferred also / than an
heretic agrees not with himself / An heretic agrees not with himself.
and have proved it when ye have done / as ye do well fauouredly in that your
treatise / where when ye have said one thing in one place / ye affirm the
contrary in another / as I shall show more planely afterward.


Barnes. But with all diligence evermore did I study to set forth the glory of
god / the obedience to our sovereign lord the king / and the true and
sincere relygion of Christ.


Couerdale. Here (gentle readers) note well and forget not / that to these
words of. D. Barnes / John. Standish says nothing / where by it appears
that he can not deny / but that. D. Barnes was a diligent setter forth of gods
glory / of due obedience / and Christ's religion. which three things who so
does / is in my mind no heinous heretic.


Barnes. ANd now harken to my faith* I believe in the holy and blessed trenyte /
that created and made all the world / and that this blessed trenyte sent down
the second person Jesus Christ in to the womb of the blessed and most puryst
virgin Mary. And here bear me record / that I do utterly condemn that
abominable and detestable opynion of the Anabaptists / which say / that
Christ took no flesh of the blessed virgin. For I believe / that without the
consent of man's will or power / he was conceived by the holy ghost / and took
flesh of her / and that he suffered honger / thirst / cold and other passions
of our body (sin except) acordinge to the saying of. S. Peter / he was
made in all things like to his brethren except sin. And I believe that he
lived here among us: and after he had preached and taught his fathers will /
he suffered the most cruel and bitter death for me and all mankind: And I do
believe that this his death and passion was the sufficient price and rawnsome
for the sin of all the world: And I believe / that through his death / he
overcame the deuell / sin / death and hell.


Standish. This is well said / but mark the deuel and Peter / the one Matthew.
xvj. the other Mark v. et ce.


Couerdale. What / are ye so forgetful of your self? Said ye not in your
preface / that the protestacion of. D. Barnes does smell and sauoure nothing
but heresy and treason? And now ye confess / that in these fore rehearced
words he said well / which could not be / if they smelled either of heresy
or treason. Standish contrary to himself.
Thus are ye become not only contrary to your self / but also a defendoure
of. D. Barnes protestacion / and approve the same. And in this do ye prove the
sentence true that I spoke of before / namely that he which is given to false
doctrine / agrees not with himself / after the ensample of you / which teach
one thing in one place / and deny the same in another.

Where as ye compare the confession of. D. Barnes / to the confession of the
deuell / we will try your doctrine by the text of. S. Mark / and there by
shall we se / how well these two confessions do agree / and how clarkly ye have
joined them together. S. Mark reports / Mar* ^*
that the legio^ of deuels which had possessed a certain man / and taken his
right mind from him / et cet. cried out and said unto our savior / What
have I to do with the / thou son of the most hie god? Here is it manifest /
that the deuell cries out of our savior Christ / and would have nothing to
do with him. When did. D. Barnes cry out of him? A great part of the world
can testify / that he has cried out of Antichrist and his chaplens / ye and
that so loud / that he has awaked a great nombre with his cryenge.

Ye but to my purpose (will ye say) the deuell also confesses / Christ to be
the son of god. I answer Their confessions be not alike. For. D. Barnes does
not only confess that Christ is the son of god / but says also / I believe
/ that he suffered the most cruel and bitter death for me / et cete. When did
the deuell believe / that Christ dyed for him? Again / The confession of. D.
Barnes*
this confession of. D. Barnes condemns the heresye of the Anabaptists
concerning the incarnacion of the lord Jesus. When did the deuell condemn any
such false opinion? Will ye make it not deuelish doctrine to be of that sect?
Beware what ye say. Are ye not ashamed then to compare these blessed words /
to the confession of the deuell / and yet to write that they be well said?


Standishe. This your confession does not prove you to be a good Christen man.


Couerdale. By your judgment / to confess the true believe in the blessed
trenyte / to confess the incarnacion of Christ / to abhor the false opinion
of the Anabaptists / to believe in Christ's death / resurrection / et cete. is
no proof of a Christen man / No though Christ himself say / Who so ever does
knowledge me before men / him will I knowledge also before my father which is in
heaven. And. S. Paul / Math. x. Luc. xij. Roma. x.
To believe with the heart / justifies / and to knowledge with the mouth / saves
/ for the scripture says / Who soever believes on him / shall not be
confounded.

Esa. xxviij.
Wherefore / if men considre your words / ye bring your self verily in to a
shrewd suspicion / for ye seem to favor the miscreauntes and infidels / even
them that believe not the articles of the Christen faith. It seems / that ye
believe in some other thing then god / else would ye make more of the Christen
belefe / then ye do.


Standish. For the most part of the heretics condemned by scripture and our
mother the church / et cet.


Couerdale. Where find ye in the scripture / that he is condemned / which
believes in the son of god? all though ye call him and write him heretic ten
thousand times? But I se well / ye lack help. I will tell you where ye shall
find a text of scripture for your purpose. S. John. the baptist says / He
that believes on the son of god / has everlasting life. And Christ our
savior says a little before in the same chapter / God so loved the world /
John. iij.
that he gave his only begotten son / that who so believes in him / should
not perish / but have eternal life / et cet. He that believes on him / is not
condemned.

And where as ye say / that then were condemned by the church / I answer. If
ye mean the church of Christ (which I doubt not to be in Englang / as well as
in other realms) then blaspheme ye it / for saienge / that it condemns them
/ whom Christ with his own mouth pronounces not to be condemned. For Christ's
church never condemns them / whom he saves. Ye and in your so reportinge /
ye blaspheme the Kings highness / chief and suppreme head next under god of
this said church of England / without whose auctorite no execucion may
laufully be done within his dominion. Howbeit among the busshes and in a
corner without the kings knowledge / a true man sometime may chance
peradventure to be hanged as soon as a thief.

If ye mean your own mother the church of the froward and multitude of
wicked doers / then verily (like a good child) ye have discloysed and uttered
your mothers secrets / and told us her very nature / which as she is a very
spiritual strompet and common harlot / so is she a mother of murder / a
shedder of innocent blood / and (by your own confession) a condemner of them /
whom Christ darre advowe to be saved.

What ye mean by the censoure of the powers / a man can not well perceive by
your words / ye speak so confusedly. But if ye mean the sentence / judgment
/ or determinacion of the hyer powers / then slaundre ye them (as I said
before) in that ye report / how they should be the condemners of those / whom
Christ has not condemned.

If by the ce^soure of the powers ye mean your own usurped auctorite / or the
stolen and untruly gotten auctorite of your mother the wicked church / then
we believe you. For in her (as the angel says) is found the blood of the
prophets and saints. Apoc. xviij.


If ye mean the fyrepanne that ye cast incense in / then may we se that your
censoure is wheter then other men's fire / and therefore the more persons for
any man to meddle withal.

If by the censoure of the powers / ye mean the censoure of your
excomunicacion / then declare ye your selves to be the cursers of them / whom
god has blessed / and so are ye cursed of god / Genesis xij. Sach. ij.
which says unto Abraham (and in him to every faithful beleuer) I will curse
them that curse the. And he that touches you (says the Prophet) touches the
apple of gods own eye.


Barnes. ANd that there is none other satisfaction unto the father / but this
his death and passion only.


Standish. Among other this was one of his errors / that he revoked the last
Easter at the Spittle.


Couerdale. Here ye take your pastyme upon the deed / and straye abroad
allmoost as far as six leafes of your treatise will extend. And now and
then because the common people that be unlearned / should the better understand
your words / ye give them a sentence of latin / and now and then half a
sentence. I could tell wherefore / if I would.

Among other (ye say) this was one of his errors. Ye judge it an error to
affirm / Standish is full of his latin.
that there is none other satisfaction unto the father / but the death and
passion of Christ only / and yet (like a learned man / full sure of your
self) ye confess planely on the other side of the leaf in your book / that
no man can satisfy for the offense. Upon this ye must give me leave to demand
this question of you. If it be erroneous to say / that Christ is the
satisfaction unto the father / and ye your self confess / Standishe is
contrary to himself.
that no man else does satisfy for the offense / To whom then shall we ascribe
this honor of satisfienge for our sins? A less what a gross error be
ye in? O blind gydes / what way will ye lead the people of god? Unhappy is
the flock / that is under your keeping. And happy is the man / whom thou (lord
god) instructest / and teach him out of thy law. It is time lord to lay
to thine hand / for they have waisted away thy law. Psalm. xciij Psalm. cxviij.


This article (that Christ's death only is the satisfaction to the father for
all the sins of the world) is plain / manifest / and approved through out
all the holy scripture / the whole sentences whereof are here to long to
rehearce / but the text is open and evident / though sometime it use one vocable
/ and sometime another. For to this article perteine all those scriptures that
report him to be the pacifier and reconciler of his fathers wrath / the
clenser / the pourger / the maker of atonement / or agreement / the opteiner of
grace / the sacrifice and oblacion for our sins / et cet. The father of
heaven himself does testify / that it is his son Jesus Christ / Math.
iij.xvij. ij. Pet. j John. j.
in who^ or by whom he is pleased and content. Who takes away the sin of
the world but he? In whom are we complete (and have all heavenly and necessary
things pertaininge to salvation) but in him? Col. ij.
I pass over the rehearsal of the scriptures written Esa. liij. Ose. xiij. j.
Pet. j.ij.j. John. j.ij.iij. Apoc. j. Heb. j.v.vij.ix.x. Tit. ij. Col. j.ij.j.
Timot. j.ij.j. Corinth. j.ij. Cor. v. Romans iij.v.

Whatsoever. D. Barnes revoked (as ye report of him) I refer that to you /
which seem to know more thereof then I. If ye were compelled by force to write
/ read / or say any thing against right and conscience / then like as they
be to blame that will fear man more then god in that behalf / so will god
certainly be the visitoure of such extreme handlinge. I would wisshe with all
my heart (if I might laufully so do) that the kings most royal person might
se as far / The kings grace knows not of all the evil that is done in his
realm.
as his hie auctorite extends / for I fear the common proverb be to true /
that there runs by the myll much water / which the miller knows not of.
Nether be all then gentle and loving intreaters of the Kings subjects / that
speak to his majesty fair words in his face / ye the Kings grace may
have Judas in his realm / as well as Christ had him in his small court. I am
sorry at my heart rote / when I remember / how often the Kings highness has
proved his conclusion true in his time. I can say no more / but refer all
secrets to god / who (I am sure) will do as he was wont / and bring all
falshode to light at the last.

As for. D. Barnes preachinge at the spittle / so far as I can learn / there
is nothing makes more against you / then that same his days work. For like
as he there openly gave a good ensample of charity and fraternall
reconciliacion / An ensample of charity.
So is the same a confusion to you and all your wanton sect / which belyenge
the truth / blasphemynge the holy ghost / and slaundrynge them that are the
price of Christ's blood as well as you (which points smell of grater heresye /
then ye can prove against. D. Barnes in this his protestacion) will not repent
/ ner ask open forgiveness. Which of your cancred sort has yet of his own
fre mind (uncompelled) come in to an open audience / and played such a part /
or desired reconciliacio^? Not one of you all / that I know of / no though the
King has commanded you in his iniunctious / and though some of you has not
been ashamed to burn gods word.


Standishe. As it was declared at Paul's cross / et cet.


Couerdale. A man's last will must stand.
D. Barnes last will and testament (where upon he takes his death) is this /
that there is no other satisfaction unto the father / but the deeth and passion
of Christ only. Therefore though it had been ten thousand times revoked before /
ye and declared never so often at Paul's cross / either in the rehearsal sermon
or other wise / Yet shall no man's reuokynge / no ner your blastinge and blowing
/ your stampinge and stayringe / your stormy tempests ner wyndes / be able to
overthrow this truth and testimonye of the holy ghost through out the
scriptures / that the death of Jesus Christ only does satisfye and content the
father of heaven / j. Ioh. j.ij.
and makes the attonoment for our sins. Nether do ye ought but bark against
the Moon / so long as ye labor to mynishe the glory of Christ / as though
he optayned not grace for all the sin of the world.

Your opynion and doctrine will not suffer Christ to be a full satisfyer unto
his father for all sins. Ye say he delivered us from origenall sin and
actual / and yet ye your selves confess / that there be also venyall sins /
Which if ye taught not to be washed awae with some other things of your own
choosing / No doubt ye would confess / that Christ delivered us from them also
/ as well as from the other.

In this your doctrine ye confess / Diversity.
that through Christ we may avoid and escape the eternal and second death /
and yet afterward say ye / that our satisfaction does please and content
allmightye god / as satisfactory for our trespace.

But how fayntly bring ye out these words (We may) O how loath are ye / that
Christ should have his due honor? Again / How stand your words now
together? If we escape the eternal and second death by Christ / how can we
ascribe the pacifieng and contenting of almighty god to our own
satisfaction? Morouer / how does god accept our satisfaction as satisfactory
for our trespace / when no man (by your own confession) can satisfy for the
offense? Is not trespace and offense all one thing?

Heresy.
Ye affirm in your latin words / that a man suffers not the eternal and
second death through the sin of Adam / which saienge includes a very heinous
heresy / and is openly confuted by the Apostle to the Romans / Roma. v.
where like as he proves that the salvation of all men came only by Christ /
so affirms he also / that condemnacion came on all men through Adam.


Standishe. No man can (I grant) satisfy pro culpa / et cetera.


Couerdale. Diversity.
Ye grant now / that no man can satisfy for the offense / and yet ye said
before / that our satisfaction is accepted of god as satisfactory for our
trespace. Diversity.
Item / ye say here / that every man must satisfy for the punishment
belo^ginge to sin / and ye granted before / that through Christ we avoid and
escape the eternal and second death. look better on your book man for shame.
Is not the eternal and second death / everlasting damnacio^ and punishment
due for sin? How can we then satisfy for the punishment belonginge unto
sin / when (by your own confession) we escape it by Christ? Alas that ye
are so blind / or that ye should build upon so weak a foundation.


Standishe. Acordinge to that of. S. Paul. j. Cor. xj. Sinos ipsos iudicaremus
/ et cet.


Couerdale. Remember your self well / and forget not / that ye have brought
in this text / to prove / that every man must satisfy for the punishment
belonging unto sin. Nevertheless let us se where upon the Apostle speaks /
and pondre the circumstaunce of his words / so shall we try / whether Paul
and you agree / and whether ye have iugled with the text or no. For I fear me
/ we shall find / that ye have played another false cast / even with this same
poor text. j. Cor. xj.
The words of the Apostle are these / If we would judge (or reprove) our
selves / we should not be judged. But while we are judged / we are chastened of
the lord / lest we should be damned with this world. These are. S. Paul's
words.

Before in another place of your treatise / ye bring in this text for another
purpose / namely / to prove / that. D. Barnes ought to have accused and
condemned himself. And now forgetful what ye said before / or else wilful
blind (as it seems) ye allege the same text / to prove / that every man must
satisfye for the punishment belonginge unto sin. Thus make ye of gods holy
scripture / a shipmans hose / wresting and wringing it to what purpose ye will.
Verily such perverting of the scripture can ye not use without your own
damnacion / ij. Pet. iij.
except ye amend / if. S. Peter be true.

The Apostle showing the Corinthians the true institucion of our lords holy
supper / and the right use thereof / concludes with these words / saying /
The text j. Cor. xj.
Let a man examen himself / and so let him eat of this bred / and drink of
this cup. For he that eats and drinks unworthily / eats and drinks
his own damnacion / because he discerns not the lords body from other
meats. Therefore are many weak and sick among you / and many sleep. For if we
judged our selves / we should not be judged. But while we be judged / we are
chastened of the lord / lest we should be damned with this world. Wherefore my
brethren / when ye come together to eat / tarry one for another / et cet.

By the circumstaunce then of this chapter / it is evident / that these words
of the Apostle extend to the right use of the holy sacrament / teachinge us /
that before we come to the lords boorde / we ought first to judge / to try /
to prove / and to examen our selves / in what case we stand toward god and
our neighbor / consideringe / that it is no childish play / ner a thing
lightly to be regarded / but a most weighty and ernest matter concerning our
salvation / the glory of god / and edifienge of the world. The holy supper of
our lord.
And when we have duly and unfeignedly tried our selves (by co^paringe our
whole conversation both inward and outward to the just commandments of god)
and by occasion thereof have heartily knowleged and confessed our sins /
being sorry and penitent for them / beleuynge steadfastly in the promises of god
/ received the absolucion of his word / entered in to true repentance and
ernest amendment of our living / being reconciled and at one with all men /
purposinge without fail so to continue till our lyfes end / Then to come /
and suppe with the lord. This is now the thing that. S. Paul teaches in this
chapter / and proves here no such article as ye go about. Therefore do ye
wrong to the text / in wrestinge it to this sense / that every man must
satisfye for the punishment belonginge unto sin. By the which your doctrine
/ O wicked opynion.
like as ye rob Christ of his worship / deface the merits and fruit of his
death / and set every man in Christ's rowme / Even so does your said article
condemn every man. For like as Christ only satisfied his heavenly father for
our sins / and for the punishment due to the same / Even so / if we should
not avoid the eternal pain of hell (which is the second death and reward of
sin^e) till we made satisfaction for it our selves / we should continue still
in the wrath of god / and so be damned for ever.


Standishe. And to prove this satisfaction / the words of I baptist Matthew.
iij. be very strong / et cete.


Couerdale. Be these words (bring forth the worthy fruits of pennau^ce)
as much to say / as / Ye must satisfye for the punishment due unto sin?
Prately well expounded of you. O shameless controllers of the holy ghost. Will
ye make John the baptist contrary to himself? Does he not say manifestly in
another place / Who so believes on the son of god / John. iij.
has everlasting life? And what is it else to have everlasting life / but to
escape the eternal and second death / even everlasting damnacion and
punishment due unto sin? Which (as ye confess your self) we do avoid
through Christ. Why do ye then wrest the scripture to your own purpose? But one
question will I ask you / Ose. xiij.
who speaks the words which are written in the Prophet Osee / saienge / From
the hand of death will I deliver them / from death will I redeem them? O death
/ I will be thy death. O hell / I will be thy stinge? Find me now any creature
in heaven or in earth / that may of himself verefie and pronounce these words
of Christ's person / and I shall grant / that he may make satisfaction for
the punishment due unto sin / which (as this text declares) is eternal
death and hell. Else / if there be but one Jesus / one sauyoure / one destroyer
of damnacion and hell / then shall he verily have my poor voice / to be called
also (as he is in deed) the only satisfier for the punishment due unto sin /
as well as he is the satisfier for sin it self.

As for the words of John the baptist / The words of John baptist.
they prove euydently / that when men convert unto god (as those Pharisees
pretended to do at the baptime of John) then shall do it unfeignedly / and not
to be ypocrites still / ner to lean to their old leue^ / but to bring forth
the worthy fruits of repentance / whereof he names part in the third of Luke
to the people / and speaks of no such satisfaction as you feign.

But Remember / that ye have named fasting prayer and allmes deeds to be the
fruits of pennaunce / for I fear me / ye will deny it again anon / when we
come to Cornelius the captain.


Standishe. Fructus.ii. dignus penitentia / est opus restaurans ea / et cet.


Couerdale. There are some of you / that call us English doctors / for
writing so much in English / as though in the understanding of other tongues
we were inferiors to you / but now ye make us your English interpreters / for
putting us to the pain to English the words / which ye wrappe up in latin
from the understanding of the people. For the worthy fruit of pennaunce (say
ye) is a work amendinge those things / Standish.
whereof the pennaunce is / that is / repayringe such things as it repents us
to have left undone / or to have committed / and this is it that we call
satisfaction for sins.

Couerdale.
That to bring forth the worthy fruits of pennaunce / is as much as to amend /
wherein so ever we have thought or done amiss / I grant / for the scripture
aloweth the same. But where as ye call that the satisfaction to god for sins
/ ye speak it not out of the mouth of the lord.

Diversity.
Again. Ye said before / that no man can satisfy for the offense / and now ye
call the fruit of pennaunce / the satisfaction for sins. Is not every offense
/ sin? Lord god / what hold is there in your words? Fie on such doctrine.


Standishe And here let us note / that it is not all one to bring forth good
fruits / and to bring forth worthy fruits of pennaunce.


Couerdale. No? where have ye auctorite of gods word for you? Be not the good
fruits of pen^aunce / worthy fruits? Or be not they good fruits that are
worthy? O unworthy teachers. What an unworthy doctrine is this?


Standish. For he that does commit no deedly sins / et cet.


Couerdale. If I should teach any man (when he has unlawfully bahaued him
self) to use unlawful things still / I am sure / that like as gods word
would therein condemn me / so would the prudent rulers of the world (acordinge
to their dewtie) look sharply upon me / and judge me little better then a
sedicious teacher. If the rulers therefore of the world will winck at such a
pestilent doctrine / and suffer it to be sown among their people / I beseech
god to se^d them his discipline / to their better enfourmacion / and so to
lighten the eyes of their understanding / that they may as well remember what
hurt comes of sedicious doctrine / as many of their subjects (ye they them
selves also) have proved it by experience. Well / yet remember the end.

Where as ye separate the fruits of innocency / of goodness / et ce. from the
fruits of pen^aunce / where find ye that in holy scripture? For albeit that
some man offends more then another / who yet I pray you is not bound to
confess himself a sinner / to declare himself sorry for the imperfectness of
his own nature / to mortify his flesh / and to live in repentance all the
days of his life? Ye be he never so innocent / just or righteous in the
estimacio^ of man? Thus by your slendre division ye prove but slenderly / that
the works of Mary Magdalene and David were not fruits of goodness / but only
fruits of pennaunce / as though pen^aunce were not good / or as though the
fruits of pennaunce were not good fruits.

As for the carnal liberty of man / it must be all way restrained / abuse of
all things is utterly forbidden / Yet must the body of man have his worship
at his need (at his need I say / not at his lust) If you now through any s^^^e
of wisdone / or chosen spritualtie will teach the contrary / then is your
doctrine condemned by. S. Paul to the Collossians. Col. ij.



Standishe^ Ye and acordinge to the qualite of the offense must be the
satisfaction. Pro mensura peccati erit plagarum modus. Deute. xxv.


Couerdale. This text verily as it is slenderly alleged / so proves it your
purpose but faintly. Moses words which you bring in / are these / Acordinge
to the measure of the offense / shall be also the measure of stripes. But let us
se the circumstaunce of the text / and so shall we try / whether ye have
played a iuglers cast / or no. And forget not (I pray you) that ye have
alleged this text / to prove / that the satisfaction must be acording to the
qualite of the offense.

Deute. xxv.
Moses writes thus / If there be a matter of plee between any men / and they
come to the law / then look whom the judges considre to be just / him shall
then declare to be in the right cause / and him whom they perceive to be
ungodly shall they condemn for his ungodliness. But if they se him which has
offended / to be worthy of stripes / they shall take him down / and cause him
to be beaten in their presence. Acordinge to the measure of the offense /
shall be also the measure of the strypes / but so / that they pass not the
nombre of forty / et cete.

This law (as it is evident) was a civil ordinance / made for the commodite
of the people / and not without mercy. The text also speaks of no such
satisfaction as ye mean. But here (forgettinge the rules of your logic) ye
would make a qualite of a quantite. Note well now how the text and Standish
agrees.
For in your article ye speak of a qualite / and the text makes mention of a
quantite nombre or measure. Again / this law will / that the party which is
to be beaten / shall not have above forty stripes. And then (by your doctrine)
it must follow / that though we be compelled to be punished / and so to make
satisfaction for the pain due unto our sins / yet should each one of us have
but forty stripes / for the text speaks of no moo. May ye not be ashamed
then / thus to mock with the scripture?


Standishe. Not like ner equal in the great offender and the less. Vnde Apo.
xviij. Quantum quis se glorificauit et in delicijs fuit / tantum illi
inferendum est tormentum.


Couerdale. Where as the voice from heaven speaks of the whore of Babylon /
and says / Apoc. xviij.
Come away from her my people / that ye be not partakers of her sins / lest
ye receive of her plages / et cete. As much as she glorified herself and
followed her own lusts / so much give ye her of punishment and sorrow / et
cet. By the last part of this text would ye prove / that satisfaction may
not be equal in the great offender and the less. Now says the text /
As Much as she glorified her self / et cete / so much give ye her of punishment.
Here is rather equalite. Equalite.


And where as the text speaks of the whore of Babylon / The femynine gendre
turned to the masculyne.
ye say. Quantum quis / et ce. turninge not only the femynine gendre to the
masculyne (which a boie that goes to the grammar scoole would not do) but also
prouinge an universal by a particular.

Again. This text speaks of her that is damned to hell / and the article
that ye go about to prove / Mete this well.
speaks of those / whom ye have affirmed already to make satisfaction unto
god for their sins by the fruits of pennaunce / which by your own judgment
are not damned unto hell. Lord god / when will this blindness have an end?


Standish. It is not enough (says Chrysostom) et cet.


Couerdale. Ioh. v.viij.
The doctrine of god is / that when Christ has made us whole (for without him
is no remission) we shall sin no more / Ephe. iiij.
he that has stolen / must steal no more / he that has not the gift of
chastity / must for the avoiding of fornicacion take a laufull wife / j. Cor.
vij.
for better it is to mary then to burn. On the back side of the book therefore
is that doctrine written / which teaches / that when a man has long lived in
whordome / he shall than abstain from the laufull use of holy wedloke / for
wedloke is the remedy appointed of god against all bodily fornicacion and
whordome.


Standish. Whereby we may perceive / et cet.


Couerdale. Yes / there be worthy fruits of repentance to bring forth / there
is a new man to put on / the tree has good fruits to bear / the spouse of
Christ (which is every true faithful soul) has laufull children / that is /
laufull thoughts / laufull words / laufull deeds to bring up and to norishe.
Good works must needs follow faith / but not that we may set any of them in
the rowme of Christ / ner make them the satifactio^ to god for our sins. God
has called us (says the scripture) unto good words / to walk in them /
Ephe. ij.
but not to make our savior or satisfaction to god / of them.


Standishe. Christ Luke. xj. when he had rebuked the Pharisees for their vice /
said / date elemosinam / et omnia munda sunt vobis.


Couerdale. That text (if it be not ironia) proves / that we are bound to do
good works / to the which though god join his loving promise (as he does
commonly through out the scripture) yet calls he not them the satisfaction to
him for sins. But like as in the lviij. of Esa. the holy ghost rebukes the
supersticion and ypocrisie of the Jews / that had fallen to works of their
own inuentynge / and then tells them the true fast and good works which god
requires / adding a louinge promise to the fulfillers thereof / Even so does
our savior here in this chapter. For when the Pharise was so supersticious /
that he maruayled why he washed not his hands before dinner / then said he
unto him / The text Luc. xj.
Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outsyde of the cup and platter / but your
inward parts are full of robbery and wickedness / et cet. Nevertheless / give
allmes of that ye have / and behold / all things are clean unto you. Lo now /
first he rebukes their supersticion / secondly / shows them what good works
he aloweth / commanding the^ to do the same / And thirdly adds a promise
thereto.


Standishe. And the preacher. Eccl. xxj. Fili peccastic et ce.


Couerdale. Those are not the words of the preacher / who^ the scripture
calls Ecclesiastes / but they are the words of Jesus Syrack / The text
Eccl. xxj.
saienge / My son / have thou fallen unto sin? Do no more so / but pray
instantly for thy former sins / that they may be forgiven the. Fly from
sins / eue^ as thou would fly from a non some serpent / et cet. This text
then proves no more your fained satisfaction / then it proves the Jews
circumcision. And like as your fond alleging of it / declares / that ye are
an hider of the scripture from the unlearned / so proves the holy ghost in the
text / that if we have broken the profession of our baptime / and be fallen
unto sin / we shall do no more so / but co^uerte and turn unto god /
continuing in the fear of him and in fervent prayer / to be at the staves end
with sin^e / and to abhor it all the days of our life.


Standishe. He that thinks this insufficient / et cet.


Couerdale. Suspectinge (as it apeareth) that your wresting of the former
scriptures will not be taken for a sufficient proof of your fained
satisfaction / ye bring in ensamples of David / Moses / Aaron / and the
children of Israel / as though their punishment had been their satisfaction.
But where find ye that in any of those places of scripture? If ye say / Why
does god the^ punish / after that he has remitted the fault? I answer / Like
as he is the father of mercy and god of all comfort / Objection. ij. Cor. j.
Sapi. iij. Prouer. iij. Heb. xij.
so does he correct and chasten his own (ye exercises and tries them as
the gold in the fire) partly because he loves the^ / and partly for the
ensample of other / that they may beware of such falls. The same ensamples
therefore that ye bring in / make clearly against you / and prove manifestly /
that ye are but blind and ignorant of the scriptures. For the Apostle
speaking of the same children of Israel / j. Cor. x.
and of their punishment / says planely / that all such happened unto them
for ensamples / but are written to warn us / that we should not lust after
evil things as they lusted / that we should not be worshippers of images /
that we should not commit whordome / that we should not te^pte Christ / ner
murmour against him as they did. Shame ye not then so irreverently to handle
the holy word of the living god?


Standishe. Forthermore Daniel cap. iiij. exhorts Nabuchodonosor / et cet.


Couerdale. If that text should prove any satisfaction to be done by man to
god (as it proves our dewtie to our poor neghbours) it should rather
maintain a satisfaction for sin / then for the pain belonging to sin /
for the text speaks of sins and iniquities / By sin^e does Standish
understand satisactio^ for sin.
and makes mention of no punishment. Have ye no better judgment ner clearer
sight in discerning of a text? Ye may be ashamed verily.

The words of Daniel as they include in them a commandment to do allmes
deeds / and show mercy to the poor (which thing every man is bound to do) so
include they in them a loving promise / to all such as are merciful in
distributing to them that lack help. And as it is an eternal worship for
them that follow this most wholesome counsel of the Prophet / so is it a shame
and perpetual confusion to all churlish hearts and unkind people (specially
to covetous princes / rulers / What a charitable heart Daniel bare toward the
poor.
and rich men) that will not do their best in prouidinge for the poor / after
the ensample of Daniel / who (no doubt) saying so many poor presoners and
helpless people (driven from Iewry to Babylon) had a singular respect to
their necessite / and therefore spoke to the King in their cause. Which thing
would god they that are great with princes or of their counsel / were as
dilligent to do / as they are to make suit in their own private causes. And
doutlesse they would be the more inclined so to do / if it were not for you and
such other / which allege not the scripture to such purpose as the holy ghost
has caused it to be written for / but frowardly wrest it for the mayntenaunce
of your own fond opinions.


Standish. Look also Jonas. iij. what satisfaction the Ninevites made / et cet.


Couerdale. The text declares / that god first sends his word / which when
it is preached (as it was by Jonas the Prophet) then the children of salvation
believe / The story of Jonas.
after the ensample of the Ninevites / and ernestly turn unto god from their
old evil way / and from that time forth give over them selves wholly to all
manner of good works. Then god approves and aloweth their works / accepts
them / has mercy of them / and pours not upon them the wrath that he has
threatened to such as will not repent. This is the sum of that whole third
chapter of the Prophet Jonas. But in all the text is there no mention made of
any such satisfaction as you feign.

Is it not an ungodly thing then / so to wrest and wringe the scripture
violently? The euerliuinge and merciful god amend it. A thing to be wisshed.
It were greatly to be wisshed / that like as the King of the Ninevites
receauinge gods word / made a proclamacion for all his subjects to fast and
pray / there were even such restraintes made likewise in every country / that
noman should wrest the scripture of god / ner allege any thing there of /
which may not justly be gathered by the words of the holy ghost / that is /
that no man should belie the text.


Standish. This satisfaction Paul speaks of Romans xij. Obsecro vos / et cet.


Couerdale. I beseech you brethren (says the Apostle) for the mercy of god /
that ye will give over your bodies / The text Roma. xij.
to be a living / holy / and acceptable sacrifice to god / which is your
reasonable seruinge of god. And fashion not your selves like unto this world /
but be changed through the renewinge of your mind. These are. S. Paul's words
/ which as ye partly hide from the unlearned / so cut ye them very short / lest
(I fear) if we heard out. S. Paul's mind / we should understand him the better.

S. Paul's doctrine is / that we must mortify our bodies / but to what intent?
To make any such satisfaction as ye would prove? Naie / so says not the text
/ but to the intent that we may serve god / as we should / serve him / to
forsake vanite / and to be altered from an euel mind to a good.

Even so like wise says the other text (which I must English for you) in the
sixte to the Romans / The text Romans vj.
Like as ye have in times past given over your members to serve sin from one
wickedness to another / so must ye now give over your members / to serve
righteousness / that ye may be holy. That ye may be holy (says he) and
speaks of no such satisfaction as ye inuente.


Standish. If I do not thus satisfy / then I shall have the reward and pain
belonging to sin / et cet.


Couerdale. To the intent that ye may spy the better in what case ye stand by
your own words (I pray god ye may look to your self by times as a Christen
man should) I will make you an argument or two out of the scripture.

To deliver from eternal death / is to satisfy for the pain due unto sin.
Mayor. Minor. Conclusio.


But Christ only delivers from eternal death.

Ergo Christ only satisfies for the pain due unto sin.

The mayor is manifest by. S. Paul (whom ye your self allege) saienge /
Roma. vj.
The reward of sin is death / even eternal death / by your own
confession. The minor is proved by the Prophet and by the Apostle. Ose. xiij.
Heb. ij.
Of these two premises gather you the conclusion.

Another argument.

Mayor.
By what one so ever we are delivered from the wrath of god (both past and for
to come) by the same is made sufficient satisfaction for the pain due unto
our sin.

Minor.
But Christ only delivers us from the wrath of god both past and for to come.

Conclusio.
Ergo he only satisfies for the pain due unto our sin.

Romans ij.
The Mayor is manifest / for the pain due unto sin is the wrath and
indignacion of god.

The Minor is evident by the Apostle / first that we are delivered only by
Christ from the wrath of god past / Ephe. ij Romans v. Col. j. Romans v.j. Tessa. j.
for he has made the peace between his heavenly father and us / and by him is
the father reconciled. Secondly / that we are delivered by him from the wrath
to come / it is clear / Romans v. and j. Tessa. j. By these two premises may
you gather the conclusion.

Mayor.
Now to your words.

To satisfy for the pain due unto sin / is the only office of Christ.

Mnior.
But ye take upon you to satisfy for the pain due unto sin.

Conclusio.
Ergo ye take upon you the office of Christ.

The Mayor is proved by the scriptures alleged before in the two first
arguments.

The minor is gathered of your own plain words.

Of these two follows the conclusion.

Then thus.

Ye say / that if ye do not thus satisfy / ye shall have eternal death.
Mayor. Minor. Conclusio.


But so ye can not do / for it is the only office of Christ / Ergo ye shall
have eternal death.

Behold now / what a dangerous case ye be in by your own words. Alas man /
that ever ye should be so blind / as to sit thus in judgment / and to give
sentence against your own soul / that Christ has shed his blood for / if
ye conform your self to be partaker thereof. Who would not note me to be five
mile fro my right wit / if I should make such an argument / and say thus /

If I be not Christ the son of god / I shall have eternal death and
damnacion.

But so it is / that I am not Christ.

Ergo / et cete.

If I should thus believe / and affirm this Mayor / would not ye abhor me?
Turn therefore / turn (for gods sake) in to your own conscience / and rebuke
it ernestly between god and you / for suffering either your hand to write / or
your mouth to speak any such inconvenience.


Standish. And now of this satisfaction finally to conclude / if there were
need of no satisfaction / after by repentance we be come in to the favor
again with god / why then did Christ say / Luke. vij. to them that love much
many sins are forgiven / and to them that love little fewer sins are
forgeuen?


Couerdale. Your opinion upon that place of the gospel / does utterly
destroy the parable of the lender and two detters / The place Luc. vij.
ye and Simo^s answer / which our savior Christ aloweth. For Simon says
/ that to whom most is forgeuen / the same loves most. And again / our
savior says. Unto whom less is forgeuen / the same loves less / By the
which two sentences every man may easily perceive / that the text speaks of
no such satisfaction as ye ymagin.

But I have spied you now at the last. O very cruel enemies to gods holy word
/ how falsely have ye perverted and turned our saviors words / to maintain
your heresy withal? Can not Christ's words stand in the gospel for you /
as he spoke them / and as the Evangelist wrote the^ / but ye must teach him how
he should say? Standish makes a new text.
Does he say in that place / To them that love much / many sins are forgiven
/ and to them that love little / fewer sins are forgeuen? Naie verily / these
are his words / Many sins are forgeuen her / for she has loved much. But
unto whom less is forgeuen / the same loves less. Will ye still then take
upon you to controlle the holy ghost? Well / beware / that this your iugling
come not to light. Beware (I say) that the breath of god blow not down your
house / for a rotten foundation can not stand long. Take heed by times / and
say ye be warned.


Standish. This saying can not be concerning culpam / et cet.


Couerdale. Our savior speaks of sins / and of forgeuing the sins / And
yet are ye not ashamed to affirm / that his saying can not be concerning the
fault but concerning the punishment. Standish would make Christ a liar.
Can not Christ speak a thing / and mean the same? Can he not be true in his
words? O blaphemers of the son of god / Ye and of that blessed woman Mary
Magdalene / which must needs be yet in her old faults and a sinner still / if
he meant not as he said / if his saienge were not concerning the fault / when
he spoke these words / Many sins are forgeuen her / et cet.


Standishe. Whereby we se / that post remissam culpam / et cetera.


Couerdale. Ye have here to fore called this satisfaction / the works of
pennaunce / Sometime.
and now say ye (but in latin) that there remains sometime a duty of
punishment to be pourged (or reconciled) with a worthy satisfaction. Which if
it be a work of pennaunce / what time can ye assign me / in the which I am
not bound to be exercised in some fruit thereof? And now come ye in with sometime.

Again / Ye said before / that the satisfaction must be acording to the
qualite of the offense / and now ye say / that the punishment due unto sin
must be pourged with a worthy satisfaction. An unworthy qualite.
Now is it manifest / that unworthiness is a qualite of every offense (for all
faults are unworthy things) wherefore by your own confession it follows /
that the pain due unto the same / must be satisfied with an unworthy
satisfaction. And verily so I take it / for unworthy is it / what so ever a man
of his own brain inuenteth without some sure ground of gods word.


Standishe And this is signified by that of the Prophet Joel / et cet.


Couerdale. The words of the Prophet (though ye choppe them very short) are
these / Now therefore says the lord / The text. Iohel. ij.
Be ye turned unto me in your whole heart in fasting / weping and mourning. And
rent your hertes and not your clothes / and be ye turned to the lord your god
/ for he is gracious and pitefull / long suffringe and of great mercy / and
will be entreated as touching sin / et cet. Does this text now signify /
that after the fault is forgiven / there remains sometime a duty of
punishment to be pourged with a worthy satisfaction? Is this your judgment in
scripture? O shameless beliers of the open and manifest text.


Standish. Now if you say Esaias (Cap. liij) says / our sauyoure bare our
sins on him / et cete.


Couerdale. Of a truth (says the Prophet) he has taken away our sorrows /
The text Esaie. liij.
and he himself has borne our pains / et cet. The correction of our
atonement was laid upon him / et cet. These are the words of Esaie / which
as they are manifest and plain / so do not you truly rehearce them as they
stand / and yet can ye not deny / but that if we conform our selves unto
Christ / then has he satisfied for us most abundauntly. To what point now
have ye brought your former doctrine of satisfaction? Verily even to this point
/ that Christ has taken away their sorrows and pains (ye and borne the
correction of their atonement) which conform them selves unto him.

For all this your confession / yet deny ye the truth again / and say /
that he delivered us not from all pain satisfactory. Now says the Prophet /
that he took away our sorrows and pains. What pain satisfactory then is there
/ that he has not delivered us from? If it be our pain / then (says Esaias)
Christ has borne it. But peradventure ye do mean some pain of your own. Ye
seem to be yet dreaming of your painful purgatory / for if ye conformed your
self to Christ and to his doctrine / ye should be persuaded and certified in
your conscience (even by the same chapter of Esaias) that Christ has as well
satisfied his heavenly father for the pain due unto your sin / as for your
sin itself.


Standishe. For if he had so done / we should nether mourn / et cete.


Couerdale. Ye say / that if Christ had delivered us from all pain
satisfactory / we should nether mourn ner be penitent for our offense
committed against god / An heinous heresy.
ner we need not to mortify our flesh. O damnable heresy. And are ye one of
the authors thereof? Are ye one of the destroiers of pennaunce / of converting
to god and of mortifienge the flesh? But as touching such another like ungodly
consequent / I have talked somewhat with you before. All the world therefore
shall know / that ye are the teachers of such pestilent doctrine / and not we.

Behold now how unsure ye are of your self. Ye say / that if Christ had
delivered us from all pain satisfactory / we should nether mourn ner be
penitent for our sin / ner mortify our flesh. And yet ye confessed before /
that through Christ we avoid and escape eternal death / which likewise (by
your own confession) is the pain due unto sin. How stond your words now
tegether?

Where as ye condemn your own perverse doctrine by the sixte chapter to the
Romans / it were sufficient to deliver you from suspicion / if ye did bide
thereby. But that do ye recante / and fall to your vomit again / saienge /


Standishe. But we should with their fleshly liberty have a joyful pennaunce
full of mirth.


Couerdale. Your doctrine is / that if Christ had taken away the pain due
unto your sin / ye should not repent for your sins / but follow / your own
fleshly liberty / et ce. Where by ye declare your self to be still of that
rotten opinion / which ye defended before.

Now where as ye report of us / that our pennaunce is with a fleshly liberty
/ I answer / Eue^ as by your former words ye prove your self to be one of
their nombre / which say (Let us do evil / Roma. iij. Romans vj.
that good may come thereof. Let us continue in sin / that there may be
abundaunce of grace. Let us sin / because we are not under the law / but
under grace) Even so Isaie / do ye declare your self to be one of them that
speak evil of us / and report us to be the affirmers of your wicked words.
As though we were they that exhorted men to a fleshly liberty / or not to live
in virtue and good works. Now god is the true judge / Psalm. v. Deute. xxxij.
Roma. xij.
who as he abhors all liers / even so refer I all vengeance to him / for
it is his office by right. But in the mean season (till all falshode be
discloised) our ernest watching and labourynge for your salvation / the poor
life which we lead in this world / and the fruits of our good will that grow
in your own gardens (for all your wedes) shall testify somewhat with us also
against your evil tongues. And god which is able to restore the blind to their
sight / shall lend men eyes to se / and understanding to discern / whether
the doctrine and open word of god which we teach / would have men to live after
there own lusts / Or whether your doctrine (which is of men's inuenting) be not
rather cause of all wickedness / robbing men of their wits / and making
them to run at riote from gods word / from his ordinance / from his
commandments / from his promises / and from the most virtuous ensamples of
gods children.

Now as touching our pennaunce / Ye would make the world believe / that when
we speak thereof / we mean some moris dance / some such delicate bancketting
as is among the ungodly / some unlawful chambringe / some such excess of
eatinge and drinking / as (god amend it) is commonly used in the world. Again
/ your doctrine is / that repentance should be without joy. And our believe
is / that if the holy ghost and the true faith of Christ go together / then
like as repentance proceadeth of faith / Gal. v.
so is the joy of Christen men a fruit of the holy ghost / as the Apostle
says. Thus also to be merry and joyful / are we taught by the scripture
Hiere. ix.j. Cor. j.ij. Cor. xj. Romans v.viij. Math. v. Luce. x. Shall we the^
be sorry / because god has done so much for us? For our sins and trespaces
we will be sorry and mourn / though when we fast / Joel. ij. Esa. lviij. Math.
vj.iij. Re. xviij Math. vj. Esa. j. Eccl. v.
we rent not our garments / ner put on sackcloth / nether disfigure our
faces to be seen of men / though when we pray unto god / we prick not our
selves with botkens / ner make to much babbling of words. Such flinges / such
morris dauncis / such wanton gestures / such light mirth we make not / for our
joy and gladness is inward / conceived in our breasts / when we feel the
inestimable mercy and love of god therein / ye eue^ when we are put to trouble
and aduersite.

Another joy have we also / and the same is likewise a fruit of our
repentance / appointed in scripture / as when we joy with them that joy /
Romans xij.
when we are glad of our neghbours welfare / glad and cherfull to do him good /
ij. Cor. ix. Romans xij.
glad to give him lodginge / et cet. Wherefore to call such fruits of
repentance / any light or wanton mirth / ye are to blame / and of a wanton
judgment.


Standishe. As these new fellows would have pennaunce to be / et cet.


Couerdale. To be called new fellows of your mouth / we do not greatly force.
But first where as ye jest upon us for casting our sin^es and care on Christ /
and for rejoicing that he has taken the^ on him / ye show your self not only
ignorant in this spiritual cause of Christ's faith / but also blasphemous
both against him and his. I pray you / who has so broad a back or so mete to
bear the sins of penitentes / as Christ has? Has not his heavenly father
laid our sins upon him / as ye your self have confessed out of Esaie? And
does he not say unto us himself / Esaie. liij. Math. xj.
Come to me all ye that labor and are laden / and I shall refreshe you? Is
not he the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world? Ioh. j.j.
Ioh. j.
And does not his blood cleanse us from all sin?

Secondly / where as ye blame us for castinge our care upon Christ / we do not
greatly pass upon it (though we lament your blindness) for we have gods word
on our side / Psalm. liiij. Matthew. vj. Luc. xij.
ye not only his commandment and precepte / but also his promise / that (so
doing) he will norishe us / and not suffer us to lack. Nevertheless in
castinge our care upon god / we rob not our body of his dewtie / but set
the hands to labor / the fete to go / the mouth to speak / and every membre
to work in his calling / Deute. vj.
lest we tempte god / contrary to his commandment.


Standish. This pennaunce Peter did not take.


Couerdale. What / will ye belie. S. Peter? Did not he cast his sins upon
Christ? Says he not planely / j. Pet. ij.
that Christ himself bare our sins on his body upon the tree / to the intent
that we might be delivered from sin / and live unto righteousness?

Or did not holy. S. j. Pet. v.
Peter cast his care upon Christ? Why bids he us then to cast all our care
upon him / addyng also / that he cares for us?

Again / Does not. S. j. Pet. iiij.
Peter also bid us rejoice / in asmoch as we are partakers of Christ's
passions? et cet. Or think ye that he did not as he taught? Was he not one of
those disciples / John. xx.
which were glad when they saw / that their lord was alive? Why are ye not
ashamed the^ / to belie him? Fie / fie / take better head to your words
another time.


Standishe. But his pennaunce was mournful.


Couerdale. Though he mourned and wept bitterly / when he had denied our
savior (as every true penitent does) yet proves not this the contrary / but
that in consideracion of the goodness of Christ / he also reioysed / as
appears by his own words before.


Standish. Theirs glad and iocunde / et cetera.


Couerdale. So glad are not we in our pennaunce / but we may find cause enough
of sorinesse / though we co^sidred nothing else / save the blind understanding
that is in you. Ye say / that we think iustificacion to be without worckes
of pennaunce. But like as ye are to malaperte to enter in to men's thoughts /
So am I glad that ye can not report / that we should preach / teach / talk or
write / that we would have iustificacion to be without works of pennaunce
folowinge. We have sufficient testimony of this
For our books / our papyre / our pens / our hands / our whole
conversation (though we have our faults as well as other men) ye and the
mouths of them that know us / can testify / that we are of a contrary opinion.


Standish. If you say / remission of sin is freely forgeuen in baptyme /
therefore we need no more pennaunce / et cet.


Couerdale. I wondre in whose name ye make that objection. If ye know any man
to affirm / teach or write / that we need no more pennaunce / because sin is
freely forgeuen in baptyme / he ought to have an open rebuke. Howbeit the same
is like unto your own doctrine where ye say / that if Christ had taken away
the pain due unto your sin / ye should not repent / but follow your carnal
liberty.

Note this well.
Now to your satisfaction / ye say here / that it springs out of the third
kind of pennaunce / and before in the eight leaf of your treatise / to prove
it strongly / ye bring in. S. John. baptistes words / which ye join now to
the first kind of pennaunce. Is it not now strongly proved? Are ye not very
sure now of the doctrine that ye teach?

Again / To prove / that by the second kind of pennaunce godly men are
pourged from such sins / without which a man can not here live / ye allege
the first chapter of the first Epistle of Ihon / who in the same place says
these words / If we say that we have felashippe with god / and yet walk in
darkness / we lie / The place j. John. j.
and do not the truth. But if we walk in light / even as he is in light /
then have we falashippe together / and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
cleanses us from all sin. This scripture now makes clearly against you / and
proves your opinion to be false / for Christ's blood cleanses us from all
sin (none except) so long as we walk in his light / and not in darkness.
Why ascribe ye then the purgacion of men's sins to any kind of pennaunce /
seeing Christ's blood has and must have the honor thereof?

Ye allege here sundry places of scripture / the circu^staunces whereof does
utterly disaproue your doctrine / as planely apeareth to him that conferreth
the same to the open words of the text / which I heartily require all
indifferent readers to do.

The place of Ezechiel is manifest / Ezech. xviij.
that god will no more think upon their sins / that truly repent and turn
from them. The place of Esaye shows / Esaie. lv.
that god will have mercy on such penitentes. The place of Hieremy is plain /
that if people convert from their wickedness / Hiere. xviij. Sap. xj.
god will no more plage them therefore. The xj. chapter of wisdom declares
evidently / that the punismentes which happened to the Egipcians / were sent
through the indignacion of god / and that the trouble / nourture / and
correction which the Israelites had / came of his fatherly mercy. The cxliiij.
Psalm witnesses / Psalm. cxliiij.
that the lord is gracious and merciful / long suffringe / of great goodness
/ loving to every man / et cet / lifts up all them that are cast down / and
is nie to all such as faithfully call upon him. Math. xviij
The xviij of Matthew is evident / hat who so ever conuerteth from his sin /
all mighty god will not that he shall perish. Item that like as all true
penitent sinners have their det freely forgeuen them / so shall they be
partakers of the same forgiveness still / if they will heartily do unto other /
as they are dealt withal them selves. These places of scripture (though ye
tell not forth the words) are of your own alleging / and yet are ye not
ashamed to write (ye even of penitentes) that none of their sins shall be
unpunished. Now is it manifest in the said chapter of Ezechiel / Ezech. xviij.
that like as god will not reward their good deeds that forsake him / and
turn away again to their vomit of wickedness / So will he not think upon
their sins that truly convert therfrom unto him. Yet call ye them happy
that punish them selves / and take upon them to be satisfactours in that
behalf. As though it were a blessed thing for men to lay crosses upon their
own backs. iij. reg. xviij. Esa. lviij. Esaie. iij.
Thus by your judgment were Baals prestes happy / and the ypocrites that the
Prophet Esaie speaks of. O disceatfull teachers. Full well might the Prophet
say unto gods people of England in this behalf / O my people / popule men's
Oui te beatu^ dicunt / et cet.
they that call the happy / do but disceaue the / and mar the way that thou
should go in.

Now let us hear more of. D. Barnes words.


Barnes. ANd that no work of man did deserve any thing of god / but only his
passion / as touching our iustificacion.


Standishe. This manner of iustificacion planely appears to be false / even by
that one place (if we had no mo) of Cornelius Acto. x. et cet.


Couerdale. The words of the text are these / The text Acto. x.
There was at Cesarea a man named Cornelius / a captain of the Italianish
company / a devout man / and one that feared god with all his house / and gave
much allmes to the people / and prayed god alwaie.

The text says in order / first / that Cornelius was a devout man and feared
god with all his house / and then speaks it of his good works / as allmes /
prayer / et cet. Whereby it is manifest / that he himself was first accepted of
god and justified / for (as. S. Peter says afterward in the same chapter) god
has no respect of persons / but (in all people) he that fears him / and
works righteousness / is accepted unto him. And (as the Prophet says) The
strangers / Esa. lvj.
gentiles or Heithen which cleue unto the lord / in worshippinge him and
loving his name / are accepted unto him / as his own servants. Again / The
scripture says / Eccle. ij. Heb. xj. Romans xiiij.
They that fear the lord / give credence to his word. And without faith it is
not possible to please god / Item / what so ever is not of faith / is sin. By
this is it manifest / that those good works of Cornelius were fruits of his
faith and of the fear of god / and he justified before he did them. Ye
confessed also before / that fasting / prayer and allmes deeds / are the fruits
of pennaunce / then must ye needs grant that the tree was before them. Diversity.


This text then proves not / that our iustificacion (deserved only by the
death of Christ) is a false iustificacion / ner that Cornelius works deserved
much of almighty god before he was justified. For (as I shall rehearce
afterward) ye confess your self / not only that we are justified freely /
Diversity.
but also that god first gives us grace / without which we can do nothing that
is good.


Standish. As did the work of King Ezechie. iiij. Re. xx. et cet.


Couerdale. Your purpose is by the ensample of Ezechias / to prove / that our
works deserve much of almighty god / before we be justified. And that work
of Ezechias which ye allege / was done long after his iustificacio^. For the
text says / that when he lay sore sick / the Prophet Esaias came to him /
and told him the message of god / iiij. Reg. xx.
And that he the^ made his fervent prayer and wept. After the which god sent
him word / that he had heard his prayer and seen his tears / et cet. And before
in the same book / it is evident / iiij. Re. xviij
that the same King Ezechias did the thing that was good in the sight of the
lord / acording as his father David had done / put his trust in the lord god
of Israel / et cet. cleued unto the lord / went not out of his paths / but did
acording to all the precepts that god had commanded Moses / and therefore
(says the text) was the lord with him in all that he took in hand.

Wherefore by the circumstaunce of the text it is manifest / that Ezechias was
justified before he lay sick / and that his prayer was a worthy fruit of his
repentance long after he was justified / and no work that deserved any thing
before his iustificacion. Nether did his prayer ner the work of the Ninevites
change the sentence of god / Heb. vj. Jacob. j.
for god is nether chaungeable ner double in his words. But like as (before the
Ninevites believed in him) he first sent his word / and thretened them / Jonas.
iij.
that if they would not convert / their city should be destroyed after fortye
days / Even so when Ezechias was fallen in to sin / ij. Par. xxxij.
god threatened him / that if he would not repent / he should dye. And like as
god (when we receive his word ernestly / believe steadfastly in him / and bring
forth good works) does accept us / Jonas. iij.
as he did the Ninevites. Even so though we have fallen from the profession of
our faith / yet if we now do ernestly repent and convert / he is merciful and
true to forgive us our sins / iiij. Reg. xx.
and to grant us our peticion after the ensample of. Ezechias. At whom like
as all kings and princes may take instruction of good governance / Even so
in him have all other sinners (that have broken their covenant with god) a
very notable ensample of true repentance.

But how rimeth the ensample either of Ezechias or of the Ninevites / for the
probacion of your purpose? Did either Ezechias after he was fallen in to sin
/ or the Ninevites (before they believed) deserve any thing of god? Or does any
of both these ensamples prove / that our iustificacion (deserved only by the
death of Christ) is a false iustificacion?

Before in the tenth leaf of your treatise / ye allege the ensample of the
Ninevites / to prove / that after the sin is forgeuen / Diversity.
we must make satisfaction unto god for the pain due there unto. And now bring
ye the same in / to prove / that our works may deserve much of almighty god
/ before we be justified. If this be not a mockyng with gods word / let them
judge that are learned therein.


Standish. Scripture is full of such ensamples / et cete.


Couerdale. Scripture is full of ensamples / bot to bring us unto the faith of
Christ / and also to make us rise up by true repentance / when we are fallen
from the same. But in all the scripture find ye no ensample / that teaches
you to call our iustificacio^ (deserved only by the death of Christ) a false
iustificacion / or to affirm / that we may deserve much of almighty god
before we b^^^^tified. And yet would ye feign prove the same / ye even by the
ensamples of those that were justified before.


Standish. Notwithstanding I am not ignorant of the order of our
iustificacion / et cet.


Couerdale. Are ye not ignorant what order god takes in justifying his people
/ and will yet teach the contrary? The more shame for you. Now may every man
(that notes your former doctrine) perceive evidently / that ye are a wilful
teacher against the order / of our iustificacio^. For if god first of his
mercy only gives us grace without which we can do no good thing / then teach
ye contrary to this order / when ye say / that men's works deserve much of
allmighte god before then be justified. Thus does your own doctrine prove you
not only to be contrary to your self / but also a wilful breaker of godly
order.


Standishe. Ille prior dilerit nos. j. John. iiij. non dilectus dilerit / et
cet.


Couerdale. Here in this place of your treatise ye make alo^g process in latin
/ which as it is fo^dly printed / and patched of you with little morsels of
scripture / so do the same make clearly against your purpose.

j. John. iiij Roma. v
Ye grant / that god first loved us / before we loved him. And that Christ died
for us / when we were yet sin^ers / Which if it be true / then is it manifest
that god first forgave us for Christ's sake. If he first forgave us / then is
your doctrine false / when ye call it against the order of our saviors prayer
/ that we must be forgeuen of god before we can forgive / And that our
iustificacion (deserved only by the death of Christ) is a false iustificacion
/ seeing ye confess also / that the mercy of god goes both before and behind
us / and that we are freely justified.

Where as ye grant also that through faith we opteine the grace of god / how
agrees that with your former doctrine against the iustificacion of faith? Ye
even the same third chapter to the Romans (that ye here allege) is against
you / Roma. iij
for S. Paul's words are these / The righteousness of god comes by the faith
of Jesus Christ / unto all and upon all them that believe / et cet. Item. Freely
are they justified even by his grace / through the redemption that is in Christ
Jesus / whom god has set forth to be the merciseate through faith in his blood
/ et cet.


Barnes. FOr I knowledge / the best work that ever I did / is vnpure and
imperfect.


Standish. Taking this saying as it is Job. xxv. et cet.


Couerdale. Take. D. Barnes words none otherwise then he spoke them / and let
them be tried by the same place of scripture that ye allege / where Baldad the
Suhite says thus / Job. xxv
May a man compared to god / be justified? Or can he that is borne of a woman
/ apeare clean? Behold / the moon is not clear / and the stars are not
clean in his sight. How much more man / which is corrupcion / and the son^e of
man / a worm? And in the ix chapter says Job himself planely / God is he /
Job. ix
whose wrath no man may resist / and under whom are subdued the proud of
the world. Who am I then to answer him / or to talk with him in my words?
Ye and though I have any righteous thing / I will not answer / but make mine
humble supplicacio^ to my judge / et cet. If equite of judgment be required /
no man darre bear record on my side. If I will justify miselfe / mine own
mouth shall condemn me. If I will show my self innocent / he shall declare me
to be naught.

Do not these scriptures prove now / that in co^sideracion of gods judgment /
all men's works are vnpure and imperfect?


Standish. Vnde Esaias. lxiiij. omnes nos immundi et qua si pannus menstruate /
but thus to his purpos it can not be taken / et cet.


Couerdale. What mean ye man / so peruersly to handle with the deed?. D.
Barnes confessed (as appears by his words) that the best works which were
done by him upon earth / in this corrupt body / were not so purely and
perfectly done / as the equite of gods law requires / and therefore (as
appears afterward) in co^sideracio^ thereof / he made his prayer with the
Prophet / Psalm. cxlij. Psalm. cxxix.
saying / Lord enter not with me in to judgment. If thou lord wilt strately
mark our iniquities / lord who will abide it? Notwithstonding though his
words be manifest / yet ye say / not only that it can not be taken to his
purpose (as Esaias wrote in that chapter) but also upon the same ye gather an
intent (for ye are good at that / ye are well skylled in judging men's intentes
and thoughts) that he should mean / all good works are naught / and that it
is sin to obey the voice of god / which your collectio^ is clean contrary
to. D. Barnes words.

And if we confer them to that place of Esaie whom you allege / this matter
shall be the more manifest. The words of the Prophet are these / Esa. lxiiij.
All we are become as an unclean man / and all our rigyteousnesses are as a
clothe stained with the flowers of a woman. This text as it makes clearly for.
D. Barnes purpose against your self / even so in alleging of it / have ye
minished it / and left out of it those words that make most against you. But
the abbot of lies and father of falshode (even the deuell) taught you that
lesson / as I told you before out of the fourth of Matthew / because ye play
such another part with a text of. S. Paul. j. Cor. xj.

In your latin ye read the text thus / All we are unclean / and as a cloth
stained with the flowers of a woman. Standish does mynish the text.
So that ye leave out (All our righteousnesses) Now if the text may stand
still for you / as the holy ghost left it / that all our righteousnesses and
best works are unclean and not without some blemishe / then happlie will you
have little thank / not only for holding against it / but also for minishing
the text.

As touching the Germans (to whom ye impute error in this behalf) Their
doctrine is / that when the servants of god have done all that is commanded
them / Luc. xvij.
they must knowledge themselves to be unprofitable / to have occasion
continually to cry unto god and to say / Matthew. vj. Luc. xj.
O forgive us our trespaces / to knowledge / that in their flesh dwells no
good thing / ye and to confess / Roma. vij.
that though they delight in the law of god after the inward man / yet there is
another law in their members / which strives against the law of their mind
/ and takes them presoners in the law of sin / which is in their members /
iij. Re. v^ij ij. Par. vj Job. vij
That there is no man but he sins / That the whole life upon earth is a very
battaill / where the flesh lusts against the sprete / and the sprete against
the flesh / so that Christen men can not bring every thing to such a
perfection / Gal. v.
as they feign would.

This is now the doctrine of the Germaynes / and thus taught also. The
scripture and. S. Austen maintain the Germans doctrine.
S. Augustine writing de verbis domini secundum Iohannem / sermo xliij. where
he says these words / We can not do that we would / why so? For we would that
there were no concupiscences / but we can not have our will. For whether we will
or no / we have them / whether we will or no / they tickle / they flatre / they
prick / they vex / they will up / they are kept down / but not yet utterly
extyncte / as long as the flesh lusts against the sprete / and the sprete
against the flesh. The same affirms he in the sixtenth sermon de verbis
Apostoli. And in the xlix chapter de diffinitionibus orthodoxe fidei / he
says after this manner / And therefore all holy men do truly in pronouncyng
them selves sinners / for of a truth they have whereof to complain / and
though not through any reprofe of conscience / yet through the frayltie / et cet.

Such doctrine now (though it be approved both by the holy scripture and by. S
Augustine) yet because the Germaynes teach it / it must needs be condemned of
you for an error. I wondre ye condemn them not also for holding so little of
the popes church / of his pardons / of his purgatory / for putting down his
religions / his chauntrees / his soul masses / and diriges / his trentals /
There Germaynes cleanse their church from the Papistrie.
pilgrameges / stacions / et cet. For ministering the sacraments in their
mother tongue / for setting their prestes daily to preach the only word of god
/ for bringing in no new customs in to the church / for avoiding whordome and
secret abhominacion from among their clergy as well as from other / for
bringing up their youth so well in the doctrine of god / in the knowledge of
tongues / in other good lettres and honest occupacions / for prouidinge so
richely for their poor / nedie / fatherless and aged people / et cet.

Now to your ensample of Abraham / which obeyed the voice of god / Does it
prove that his obedience was so perfect / as the equite of gods justice
required? Or that his own words were false / when he said unto god / Genesis
xviij
I am but dust and ashes?


Standish. Also it is said. Job primo / In omnibus his non peccauit Job.


Couerdale. The later part of the text (which declares the whole meaning
thereof) leave ye quite out. The words of the scripture are these / The place
Job. j
In all these did not Job sin^e / ner spoke any foolish thing against god. The
place ^o^. ^^
Now is it manifest by the same chapter / that when the scripture has told of
the great aduersite that Job had in the loss of his goods and children / it
makes mention also of his notable patience / and then concludes the chapter
with those words. The on part whereof like as ye leave out / and tell the
other in latin from the unlearned / so make ye of a particular an universal /
asthough Job might not offend in other things / though he grudged not here
against god. For manifest is it / that he did afterward curse the day of his
birth / as the third chapter declares. Ioh. ^ij
Now because Job was pacient in his first aduersite and blasphemed not god /
does that prove it an error to hold with him when he says / If equite of
judgment be required / no man darre bear record on my side? If I will
justify miselfe or show miselfe innocent / mine own mouth shall condemn me?
(...)



Standishe. And. S. Peter. ij. Pet. j. after he has recyted certain virtues /
et cet.


Couerdale. S. Peter before those words / speaking of the same virtues /
says thus / If these things be present and plentiful in you / they shall
not let you be idle ner unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord Jesus Christ.
Let one place of scripture now open and expound another.


Standishe. Furthermore a strong argument to prove it / may be this. Omnis qui
in deo manet / no^ peccat. j. Ioh. iij. Sed qui manet in charitate / in deo
manet. j. Ioh. iiij / ergo qui manet in charitate no^ peccat / et cet.


Couerdale. To your argument I answer / j. Ioh. iij.
Like as it is true when the scripture says / they that are borne of god
sin not (partly because god has covered their sin / and imputes it not
unto the^ / and part / Roma. iiij
ly because they are at the staves end with sin / and delight not in it but
keep them selves from sin^e / Roma. vij Gala. v j. Ioh. j.
as. S. John says in the same fifth chapter) So is it true also / that if we
say we have no sin / we disceaue our selves / and the truth is not in us /
as holy. S. John says. In the declaracion of the which words. S. Augustine
notes heresy in the Pelagians and Celestines / for affirminge / that the
righteous have utterly no sin in this life. Take you head therefore / that ye
smell not of the Pelagians pan / for it stinketh afar of.


Standish. As David speaking in the person of every good man / said he did /
seruaui mandata tua domine / Psalm. cxviij.


Couerdale. He says also a little after in the same Psalm unto god / The
place of the psalm cxviij
I have gone astraie like a sheep that is lost / O seek thou thy servant. The
circu^staunce also declares / that it is not only a Psalm of consolacio^ /
of doctrine and of thankesgeuing / but also an ernest prayer of one that is
very fervent in gods cause and in the defense of his word. So that like as
sometime he mourns and wepeth to se the acts and statutes of god despised /
Even so co^playneth he sore unto god / of them that manteyne any doctrine
contrary to his word. Thus in respect of them he darre boldly say / that he
keeps gods commandments / and no men's doctrynes / for he abhors all the
false lerning of ypocrites / But in consideracion of his own infirmite / he
says to god often times in this Psalm / O teach me thy statutes / give me
understanding / that I may learn thy statutes / save me / help me / deliver
me / et cete. Like as in another Psalm (where he confesses to have kept the
ways of the lord) he says a little after in the same Psalm / Psalm. xvij
O my god / give thou light unto my darkness.


Standish. Acording to gods saying to Jeroboam. ijj. Reg. xiiij.


Couerdale. Though god covered David's sins / and imputed them not unto him /
yet made he his confession unto god (while he was in this body) and said / If
you lord wilt strately mark iniquities / Psalm. cxxix Psalm. cxlij
lord who shall abide it? Lord enter not in to judgment with thy servant / et
cet.


Standish. And also as it may be proved / by this that god commands us
nothing impossible for us to do.


Couerdale. One false opinion would ye prove by another / and by this present
article (like as by the other before) ye declare your self to be a very
Pelagian / and partaker of their heresy / confuted by. S. Augustine / in the
sixtenth chapter of his book de libero arbitrio / and in moo other places.


Standishe. But he says not only Matthew. xix. si vis ad vitam / et cet.


Couerdale. Your argument is this. God that commanded us to keep his law /
ergo it is not impossible for us so to do. The place Math. xix:
But whether your co^sequent will be allowed in the checker or no / we shall se
by our Saviors own words. Who when he had said to the young man (if thou will
enter in to life / keep the commandments) and told his disciples how hard
it is for the covetous to enter in to heaven / They asked him and said / Who
can the^ be saved? Then answered he them / saying / With men it is impossible /
but with god are all things possible. Down then goes the Pelagians heresy /
and little thank are ye like to have / for holdinge with it.

If he ask / Objection.
Why then does god command us to decline from evil and to do good / if it be
not in our power? To the same objection does. S. Augustine make a sufficient
answer in the second chapter de correptione et gracia / Answer.
and not only refelleth it by. S.P. words (saie^g / Philip. ij
It is god which works in you both the will and the deed) but also puts us
in mind / Romans viij
that if we be the children of god / we are led by gods sprete to do good /
that when we have done any good thing / we may give thanks to him of whom
we are led / et cet. And in another place / De lib. arb. cap. xvj
Therefore does he command certain things that we can not do / because we
might know what thing we ought to ask of him. The same doctrine teaches he
also in the lxiij sermon de tempore. Romans vij.
This is confirmed by holy scripture / for by the law comes the knowledge of
sin / So that even they which are renewed in Christ / find by the law / that
when they would feign do good / (for therein is their delight) evil is present
with them.

The words of our Savior (if ye love me / keep my commandments) prove
no more your purpose / then your wresting of them proves you to be a true
scolar of his. For after those words he himself says thus / I am the way /
the truth and life. Ioh. xiiij.
No man comes to the father / but by me. Naie (says your doctrine) we may
come to god by our selves / he commands us nothing impossible for us to do.
Now let me ask you this question / If Christ when he said these words (If ye
love me / keep / my commandments) did mean / that it is not impossible for
us so to do / why then immediately after the same words / does he promise us the
sprete of conforte? What need have we of him / if we be not comfortles of our
selves / or if nothing that he commanded us / be impossible for us to do? What
need have the whole of a phisician? And. S. S. Augustine de uerbis Apostoli.
Augustine writing against them that extolle their own possibilite in the
second sermon de uerbis Apostoli / says / Let us be glad to be healed while
we are here in this church / Let us not make our boast of health being yet
sick / lest by our pride we do nothing else / but make our selves incurable.


Standishe. Which to the lovers of the^ be but light. Math. xj.j. Ioh. v / and
Deuteronomy. xxx.


Couerdale. Ergo god commanded us nothing impossible for us to do? Is that
your consequent? Full faintly are ye able to prove it by those three chapters
that ye do allege. First / in the xj of Matthew. Math. xj
does our Savior bid all them that are laden / et cet. to come to him. And
yet says he in another place / that no man can come unto him / Ioh. vj
except his father draw him. Where is now our possibilite?

That fifth chapter of. S. j. Ioh. v
John's first Epistle shows / that they which are borne of god / do over come
the world by the victory of faith. Now like as we begat not our selves in the
Kyndome of god / Iaco. j
but he himself of his own good will begat us with the word of life / So is
it manifest also that true faith is the only workyng of god / Ephe. ij
and not ours. Where is then (I say) our possibilite? forsoith even fled into
the isle of weakness.

If by the thirtieth chapter of Deuteronomio^ ye will prove / that god has
commanded us nothing impossible for us to do / because Moses says / This
precepte that I command the this day / is not above the ner far from the /
et cete. Then must I require you to take the answer of S. Paul / who says /
that it is the righteousness of faith which speaks those words / and that
the word which Moses there spoke of / Roma. x
is the word of faith / that Paul himself preached.

If ye think there to prove your purpose / because Moses lays before the
people / life and death / good and euel / blessinge and cursinge / and bids
them chose life / et ce. Then must I desire you / not only to remember the
office of the law / wherefore it was given / and where to it serves / But also
to considre / that in the beginning of the same thirtieth chapter / Moses
himself says these words / Deute. xxx
The lord thy god shall circumcise thine heart / and the heart of thy posterite
/ that thou may love the lord thy god with all thy heart / and in all thy
soul / et cet. Whereby it is evident / that except god circu^cise our hertes /
we are not able to love him / ner to keep his commandments / So that these
words of Moses do prove rather impossibilite in us. Roma. ij
For the circumcision of the heart (says the Apostle) is the true circumcision
/ which is done in the sprete and not in the lettre / whose praise is not of
men / but of god.

All these three chapters now prove / that like as to be saved / to keep gods
commandments / to have circumcised hearts / and to overcome the world with
the lusts thereof / is the only workyng of god in us / j. Ioh* v
Even so to them that love god are his commandments not grievous (not through
any possibilite of man) but partly because Christ has taken away the curse
of the law and delivered the^ from the heavy burdens of their souls / Gala.
iij Math. xj.
and partly because they delight in gods commandments / Psalm. cxviij
and esteem his word sweter then honey / as David did. For love makes all
things light.


Standish. Therefore I conclude / in all our workynge we do not commit sin.


Couerdale. Of an evil Mayor and Minor follows a weak conclusion. Ye have
wrung and wrested the scriptures violently / to make them serve for your
purpose / and now without any scripture make ye your conclusion / that in all
your workyng ye do not commit sin. To the probacion whereof (because ye
bring no scripture your self) I will help you with a text / where the
scripture says thus There is no righteous man upon earth / Eccle. vij
that does good / and sins not. If ye be a man (I will not reason much with
you of righteousness / for I am a sinful man miselfe) then must ye needs
grant this scripture to be true. If ye be no man / then am I sorry that I have
disputed with you so long / for angels have no need of my words / and as for
deuels / they will not be counseled.


Standish. No ner our deeds and acts which be good can not be called so / et
cet.


Couerdale. Of. D. Barnes secret intent and meaning will not I presume to be
judge / but what may be gathered by the circumstaunce of his words / I have
reasoned with you already.

Now because ye can not prove this last part of your conclusion by scripture
(namely that your good deeds and acts are not vnpure ner imperfect in this
life) therefore the Prophet Esaie to recompense you the wrong that ye did him /
in minishing his words before / will yet take the pains for you to prove your
purpose (though it be little to your mind) When he says / All we are become
as an unclean man / Esaie. lxiiij
and all our righteousnesses are as a clothe stained with the flowers of a
woman. Prouer. xx
And the wise man says also? Who may say / My heart is clean / I am pure
from sin?


Barnes. ANd with this he cast abroad his hands / and desired god to forgive
him his trespass.


Standishe. Extra ecclesiam nulla salus / et cetera.


Couerdale. Without the church (ye say) is no salvation / Now is it manifest /
that beside the church made of lime and stone / there is also a congregation
church and multitude of froward and wicked doers / which not only gather them
selves together like roaringe lions / fatt bulls / wanton calves and curre
dogs against Christ (as the xxj Psalm complains) but also make laws /
co^stitucions / statutes / ordinances and tradicions against gods word /
Whereby it comes to pas / that though they boast never so much of gods service
/ Esa. xxix Math. xv
yet all is to them in vain / as the Prophet and Christ himself does testify.

Another church is there / which is the holy spouse / congregation and company
of them / that are of the felashippe and communion of Christ / j. Ioh. j.
and walk not in darkness / but in the truth / having al their sins cleansed
by his blood. Acto. ij.
This church continues in the Apostles doctrine / renneth not out from the
heavenly felashippe of Christ and his members / distributeth the sacraments
duly and truly / ceasseth not from praieng and well doing / et ce. are of one
mind and soul / Acto. iiij
are glad to help one another / as it is manifest in the acts and Epistles of
the Apostles. The men of this church pray in all places / liftinge up pure
hands / et cet. j. Timo. iij Matthew. vij Luc. xj. Math. xviij Luc. xxiiij
In this church whosoever asks / has / he that seeks / finds / and to him
that knocks / does god open. In this church is fre pardon and remission of
sins for all true penitentes. For god will not the death of sinners / John.
xx Ezech. xviij Math. xj. John. vj.
but if they co^uerte unto him / they shall live / and who so is laden with
sin and comes unto Christ / finds rest and ease in his soul / and shall
not be cast out.

Forasmuch then as ye condemn. D. Barnes thus doing (and judge him to be none
of the church / that desires god to forgive him his trespace) it is evident /
that in your church there is no forgeuenes for poor sinners / and so is it not
the church of Christ. Wherefore / saying ye discente from Christ's church /
where the door is ever opened to them that knock / your own sentence
conde^neth you / Luc. xxiij
that ye can trust to have no salvation by gods promise.

But alas / what blindness is in you? Though a sinner does err or has erred
from the right faith and from the true use of the holy sacraments that be in
the church of Christ / and now comes to repentance / desiringe god to
forgive him his trespace / Is not this a damnable doctrine to teach / that he
can not trust to have salvation by gods promise? No? has god promised / that
sin^ers which repent / shall not be saved? The thief that hanged on the right
hand of Christ / has proved the contrary.

Again / If a sin^er may not trust to have salvation by gods promise / whereby
the^ may he trust to have it? By himself? by his own works? Or by your
merits? Even by your merits (as it apeareth) would ye have him trust to have
salvation / for ye must needs be full of merits / that in all your workyng
commit no sin / as ye say your self.

Morouer / the tenoure of your words separateth the mercy of god from his
promise / as though they co^curred not together. But I pray you who can trust to
have salvation by gods promise / and trusts not in his mercy? When the Apostle
says / Galat.
God gave the enheritaunce unto Abraham freely by promise / was it not done by
his mercy? And when he says in the same chapter / Ye are the heirs of Christ
acording to the promise / Tit. iij
what means he else but (as he says to Titus) that the kindness and love of
our savior has appeared / not for the deeds of righteousness which we have
done / but acordinge to his mercy has he saved us? et cet.

S. James words which ye bring in in latin / Jacob. ij.
denies no forgiveness to them that repent / but like as he rebukes them
that are but Christen men in word and not in good works and deeds / so (if
parcialite be sin) then does the circu^staunce of the same text condemn your
former conclusion / that say / ye sin not in all your works.


Standishe. Look the reward of finalis impenite^tia / et cet.


Couerdale. D. Barnes words testify what faith and repentance he had toward
god / and what heart he bare toward the common wealth of all Christendom / and
yet shame ye not to write / that he dyed without repentance and in errors /
because he would not deny Christ / and revoke his word with you.


Standishe. Which died by his words / without sign or token of salvation.


Couerdale. Is it no token ner sign of salvation to believe in the holy and
blessed trenite / the incarnacion / passion death and resurrection of our
savior / and to knowledge the same before men? Is all this utterly no token of
salvation? Math. x. Roma. x.
Christ and the Apostle Paul are of another judgment.


Standishe. And so his prayer must needs be void.


Couerdale. D. Barnes cast abroad his hands / and desired god forgeuenes / and
yet darre ye affirm / that his prayer must needs be void. Matthew. xviij Luc.
xxiiij Ioh. xx.
By the which words like as ye deny the article of forgiveness (mentioned in
our Creed / and promised in the scripture to every one that truly repents) so
declare ye evidently / that there is little mercy in your mother the church of
the wicked / for in Christ's church if the son ask the father a piece of bred
/ he will not give him a stone / Matthew. vij
but good things.


Standish. Mark how he trusts with in an hour / et ce.


Couerdale. Is it blind arrogauncy / when a man (refusing all confidence in
his own works) trusts to have eternal life through the mercy of god? What
blind arrogauncy was in the Apostle / when he said / we know certainly / ij.
Cor. v.
that if our earthy house of this dwelling were destroyed / we have a building
ordained of god / an house not made with hands / but everlasting in heaven?
Ioh. v.
Our savior also gives this comfort to such as believe in him / that they
shall not come to damnacion / but pass from death unto life? Are ye not a
comfortable Phisician then to men's consciences / that shame not to teach other
wise then Christ does? But surely these two places of scripture are not for the
stablishinge of your soul masses and diriges / and therefore no maruaill that
ye teach a contrary doctrine / For though the name of your purgatory be out of
some of your books / Yet are not all purse pykers come to the pillary.


Barnes. FOr allthough perchance you know nothing by me / yet do I confess
/ that my thoughts and cogitacio^s be in^umerable. Wherefore I beseech the
enter not in to judgment with me / acording to the saying of the Prophet David
/ Psalm. cxlij.
non in tres in iudicium cum seruo tuo domine / Psalm. cxxix
and in another place / si iniquitates obseruaueris domine / quis sustinebir?
Lord if thou strately mark our iniquyte / who is able to abide thy judgment?


Standish. Se I pray you / the deuell seduced him so far / that he would not
knowledge any sin / but only cogitacions / et cet.


Couerdale. D. Barnes said not that he had no sin / but all though (said
he) perchance you know nothing by me / yet I confess / that my thoughts
and cogitacions are in^umerable. Is this as much to say as / I have no sin
but only cogitacions and thoughts? Or be not thoughts and cogitacions sins
great enough? Did he not confess also with the Prophet / that if god would
strately mark his iniquities / he were not able to abide it? Is iniquity no
sin? Not in your judgment (as it appears) for ye darre boldly affirm /
that in all your workyng ye commit no sin.


Standish. Se how he judged other men perchance to know no sin in him / et
cet.


Couerdale. If it be an abominable vice (as it is no doubt) to slaundre the
scripture or to belie it / then verily are ye infecte with abominable vice /
that have misreported it and belied it in so many places of this your
treatise. Now if ye be of counsel with so many good men that knew such vices
in D. Barnes / I maruaill ye tell us not what those vices are. As for your
mother the unholy church / he called her an harlot many times. And sure I am /
that who so knows her thoroughly / Ezech. xxiij.
and co^pareth her with her fruits to Oolla and Ooliba / will judge her to be
little better.


Standish. Judge therefore your selves what avails him these his fained
prayers / et cet.


Couerdale. The prayers that. D. Barnes uses here / are the holy words of
gods scripture / and yet ye call the^ feigned prayers. Now if the holy ghost
which is the authoure of the scripture / does abhor faynednesse (as the wise
man says) then verily is it blasphemous to call those fained prayers / Sapi. j.
that he only has taught.

Again / If they be fained prayers / why say ye that ye doubt not / but to
another man passing in the faith of Christ / they should have been acceptable
ye and meritoryous before god? Can fained prayers be acceptable to god? Can
feigned prayers merit or deserve any thing of god? Or can he that dies in the
faith of Christ / use feigned prayers at his death? How agrees faynedesse with
the faith of Christ? Full fained and false is your doctrine / Our lord root
it ones out from among his people.


Barnes. Wherefore I trust in no good work that ever I did / but only in the
death of Jesus Christ.


Standishe. To trust in our works (ut in deum credimus) that they of them
selves / et cet.


Couerdale. What an unstable doctrine is this / that ye bring in among gods
people / and would bear them in hand / that Christ allowed your saying in the xx.
of Matthew? Matthew. xx
Where as the parable in the same chapter / and the process of the last part
of the xix. chapter hard before it / do utterly condemn your doctrine. Lord god
/ what a derogacion unto gods hye glory is this / to teach / that we may trust
in our works / that we may calenge our inheritance by our workyng / that
our workyng may deserve to receive immortalite? In the later end of the xix.
Matthew. xix
chapter of Matthew does our lord affirm / that to be saved is a thing
impossible through the power of men / And in this xx chapter does his parable
testify / that like as we are first called by him / receive his promise / and
are set a work by his comaundeme^t / so is not the reward given / for any
deserving / or pains taking / but acording to his own promise.

First / where find ye in any article of the Christen faith (contained within
the holy bible) either commandment or promise of god / or example of any good
man / that we may put any manner of trust in our works? Again / If our
enheritaunce come by the death of Christ and his promise / how comes it by our
workyng? Is our workynge the death of Christ or his promise? Now if our workyng
may deserve the inheritance of immortalite / Diversity.
then may we make satisfaction unto god for our offense / and that ye have
denied before. O how well agree ye with your self?


Standish. And this caused Paul boldly to say.ij. Timo. iiij. Bonum certamen
certaui / et cet.


Couerdale. When that holy vessel of god. S. Paul had exhorted Timothy to the
fervent executing of his duty in preaching gods word / and had told him
before of this present perlous time / that men will not suffer wholesome doctrine
/ et cete. The place ij. Tim. iiij
He showed him of his own death saie^ge / For I am now ready to be offered /
and the time of my departing is at hand. I have foughten a good fight / I
have fulfilled the course / I have kept the faith. From hence forth there is
laid up for me a crown of righteousness / which the lord the righteous judge
shall give me in that day / not only unto me / but to all them that love his
coming.

What caused Paul now to say these words? Any trust or confidence in his own
deseruyng or works? Nay verily. He confesses not only that the crown of
righteousness is laid up for him / but also that god shall give it him /
nether says he here / S. Paul condemns. Standish doctrine.
that it shall be given him for his workyng sake / for then were he contrary to
his own doctrine / which utterly condemns yours / Roma. iij. Ephe. ij.
Philip. iij. ij. Timoth. j. Tit. iij Note well the places your self.


Standish. All be it I fear me these his words / et cete.


Couerdale. If when he did any good work / he caused no trompettes to be
blown before him / ner mombled up long prayers in the corners of streets /
ner disfigured his face to be seen of men when he fasted / then was there the
less ypocrisie in him. It is a proverb as true as old / A still pater noster
is as good as a loud.


Barnes. I do not doubt / but through him to inheret the kingdom of heaven.


Standish. I beseech god / this false and erroneous believe contrary almost in
every sentence to our mother the holy church / et cet.


Couerdale. Full unholy and ungracious is your mother / (and ye as unwise to
take her part) that calls it a false and erroneous believe / when a man
doubts not but to inheret the Kingdom of heaven through Christ. If that
believe be contrary to your mother / then is she contrary to it / and so is she
the sinagoge of Antichrist. Ye are afraied / that the innocente lambs of
Christ / should harken to his voice / and not to yours / Ioh. x
but set your heart at rest / for they will not harken to the voice of
strangers.


Standish. Who does believe by any other means contrary to Christ / et cet.


Couerdale. Yes forsoyth even you / if ye believe as ye write. For the same
preemynence that is due to the death of Christ and his promise / Standish words
rebuke himself.
give ye to your workyng in the viniarde / Ye ye put confidence / that your
workyng shall deserve immortalite / Remember your own words well.


Standish. But What Christian does cast of and forsake all duties to our part
belonginge / and so temerously / et ce.


Couerdale. One duty that belongs to your part / is the sincere / and true
teaching of gods holy word / which duty though ye cast of and forsake / I
will not say all that I might by your own words / but god amend it / that
is amiss. Again / this protestacion of. D. Barnes testifies / that he does
not cast of and forsake al duties to a Christen man belonginge / This is no
casting away of all honest duties.
for he believes in the holy trinite / he extolleth the merits of Christ / he
praises our lady / he abhors the Anabaptists heresy / he prays for the
kings highness / he exhorts men to good works / he besecheth god to
forgive him his trespace. Be these no duties of Christian me^? What has moved
you then thus untruly to report of him?

Where as ye lay presumpcion to his charge for trustinge to inheret the
Kingdom of heaven through Christ / I have answered you before / where ye imputed
like arrogauncy unto him for so doing.


Standish. Which go about being blind the^ selves / et cet.


Couerdale. Math. vij.
Those heretics / of whom Christ bids us beware / are false prophets /
which come in shepes clothinge / but inward are rauenyng wolves. Ye shall know
them (says he) by their fruits. Now in describing unto us their fruits / he
shows us / that they are such as boast of their works / and say / have not
we done this? have not we done that? Other blindness speaks he not of in
that chapter. In the fiftenth chapter calls he those blind leaders of the
blind / which (through their own tradicions) make the commandment of god to
take none effect.


Standish. And Paul speaks of them / prima Timo. iiij. et cetera.


Couerdale. The heretics whom. S. j. Timo. iiij.
Paul prophecieth of j. Timo. iiij. are such as through their deuelish doctrines
/ forbid men to live in holy wedloke / and command them to absteyne from
the meats / which god has created to be received of Christen men / with
thankesgeuing.

The heretics of whom he speaks ij. Tim. iij. ij. Timo. ^ij.
are such as (among all other vices) are covetous / boasters / proud / cursed
speakers / et cet. false accusers / ryotous / fearce / despisers of them that
are good / traitors / et cet. having a shine of godly living / but denyeng the
power thereof / resist the truth / being men of corrupt minds / and lewd in
things pertayninge to the faith / et cet.

The heretics that he speaks of in the xx of the Acts / Acto. xx.
are such grievous wolfes as spare not Christ's flock / and speak perverse
doctrine / to draw disciples after them.

The heretics whom. S. Peter speaks of / ij. Pet. iij.
are such mockers as regard not gods promise / and are not only unlearned / but
also unstable / and peruerte Paul's Epistles / as they do the other scriptures
also to their own damnacion.

Jude. j.
The heretics whom. S. Jude speaks of / are such as (among other errors) are
craftily crepte in to the church / and turn the grace of our god unto
wantonness / and deny god the only lord / and our lord Jesus Christ / Even
such dreamers as defile the flesh / despise rulers / et cet. speak evil of
the things that they know not / and in such things as they know to be
natural / do currupte the^ selves as beasts / following the way of Cain / the
error of Balaam for lucres sake / and the treason of Core / feding them
selves / making feasts of other men's kyndnesse / and having men in great
reverence because of advantage / et cetera.

Have ye not now well descrybed the papistrye and the unholy pilers of your
unholy mother the church of the wicked? If ye had joined the second chapter
of. S. Peter's second epistle and the xxiij of Matthew / to these places that
ye have here alleged / ye had done us the more pleasure. But we thank you for
pointing us to those scriptures / we know you now better then we did before.

Hiere. xix
Now to Hieremy the Prophet / Like as in the xix chapter god treateneth
destruction to Jerusalem and Tophet / Hiere. xxiij
forshedding of innocent blood / and for their ydolatry / So in the xxiij
chapter threateneth he sore punishment to those Prophets or preachers / that
speak of their own heads and not out of gods word. Hiere. xxvij
And in the xxvij chapter he counceleth King Sedechias and his people / to
give no credence unto those Prophets / that speak fair words to them and
would make them believe / that there should come no such plage as god has
threatened.

As for the thirtenth chapter of Ezechiel which ye allege / Ezech. xiij
I will heartily desire all Christen readers / not only to compare it to the
xxiij of Hieremy / but also with due reverence (for so must gods word be
entreated) to way and pondre well every sentence thereof. And so doing I doubt
not / but the holy ghost shall mynistre such bright spectacles to their sight /
that they shall clearly discern and se / who be scismatikes / who be false
Prophets / and who be true. For I can wish no man so good a glass to look in
/ as the scripture.


Barnes. TAke me not here / that I speak against good works. For they are to
be done: and surely they that do them not / shall never come to the kingdom of
god / We must do them / because they are commanded us of god to show and set
forth our profession / not to deserve or merit / for that is only the death
of Christ.


Standishe. It is commonly said / No venim or poison is worse / et cet.


Couerdale. D. Barnes set forth good works.
Does not he set forth good works / that prayseth them / teaches men to do
the^ / and threateneth damnacion to them that do them not? Here ye can not
deny (by your own confession) but that he praises good works / and yet ye
have reported of him / that he cast of and forsook all duties to our part
belonginge. Is it not our duty to praise good works?


Standishe. But mark / it is naught that he speaks afterward / et cet.


Couerdale. Is it naught and erroneous to say that we must do good works /
because god has commanded them? Eccl. xxix.
The wise man says / Take the poor unto the for the commandments sake /
et cet. Is it not gods commandment to do good unto the poor?

Morouer / where find you in all holy scripture that god has commanded us to
do good works to the intent that we should merit or deserve / and not to show
and set forth our profession? Must we not let our light so shine before men /
Matthew. v
that they may se our good works / and glorifye our father which is in
heaven? Has not our Savior chosen and ordained us to go and bring forth
fruit / Ioh. xv.
et cet. Were we not made heirs of eternal salvation and baptized / Roma. vj
Roma. vij
to the intent that we should now malke in a new life? Are we not deed from the
curse of the law / and married unto Christ / to the intent that we should now
bring forth fruit unto god? Ephe. ij
Has not god ordained us to walk in good works? Are we not chosen of god to
show now his wonderful works / which has called us out of darkness in to his
marvelous light? Must we not lead an honest conversation in the world / j. Pet.
ij.
that they which bacbyte us as evil doers / may se our good works and praise
god?

Now to do good deeds / to bring forth good fruits / to walk in a new life /
to show gods wonderful works / to lead an honest conversation in the world /
what is it else / but to show and set forth our profession / the life that we
have promised and taken us to at the font stone / even the holy covenant and
appointment that we have made with the eternal god? Do ye not considre also /
j. Pet. iij.
that the scripture appoynting married women their estate and duty / wills
them to be of so honest conversation / that even they which as yet will not
believe gods word / may without the word be won by their godly living? And
not only this / j. Timo. ij.
but so to array them selves in comely apparel with shamefastness and discrete
bahaueour (without excess) as it becomes women that profess godliness
through good works? What can be more planely spoken / then this? How ernest is
the scripture likewise in mouinge and commanding (us specially that take in
hand to instruct and teach other) above all things / j. Pet. v Timo. ij.
to show example of good works in the doctrine of god / et cet. that such as
resist his truth / may be ashamed of their part / having nothing in us to
report amysse? And immediately after in the same chapter / how dilligent is the
Apostle in requiring Titus / to exhort servants to the doing of their dewtie
to their masters / and to show all faithfulness? But for what intent? to
merit or deserve immortal^^^* Nay / to the intent that in all things they
may do worship to the doctrine of god our Savior / that the name of god
and his doctrine be not evil spoken of. j. Timo. vj
Thus would he have Timothy also to teach and exhort / and then says he
these words / If any man teach otherwise / and agrees not unto the wholesome
words of our lord Jesus Christ / and to the doctrine of godliness / he is
puffed up / and knows nothing / et cet.

Read ye the text forth / and remember your self well / considre in what case
ye are / and how wide your doctrine disagreeth from the wholesome word of god.
If I should say ye were puffed up / ignorant / a waist brain / et cete. of a
corrupt mind / or robbed of the truth / ye would happlie be angry. Yet be
content to let Paul speak to you / for though he rail not / yet shall ye not
find him a flatrer.


Standish. Which thing being true (as the church confesses / et cete.


Couerdale. The church of the wicked grants many moo things then it shall
ever be able to prove / except it be with violence and shedding o^ ^nnoce^t
blood / which is in very deed a fearce / sore and strong way of probacion.
Nether be they heretics that deny this your doctrine / for I have proved unto
you by open scriptures / that your doctrine is false.


Standish. Be not our own good works meritorious to ourselves?


Couerdale. Yes parde / for the prophet says / Esaie. lxiiij.
All our righteousnesses are as the cloth of a menstruous woman.


Standish. Whether shall we rather believe. S. Hierome / et cete.


Couerdale. If we receive the witness of men / j. Ioh. v.
the witness of god is greater / for this is the witness of god / which he
has testified of his son / et cete. Even that god has given us everlasting
life / and this life is in his son. S. Augustine says also /

All my hope is in the death of my lord / his death is my merit / my refuge /
my salvation / my life / and my resurrection.


Standishe. Which for their detestable opynions deserved justly to be burnte as
heretics.


Couerdale. If they were not burnte heretics in deed / no force. And if they
were just deseruers / it is a toke^ that they meddled the more with
righteousness / for no man can justly err / ner justly commit treason.


Standishe. What a detestable heresy is it to say / the cause that we be
commanded to do good works / is to set forth our profession?


Couerdale. Is not our profession the promise and covenant that we have made
with god / to seek his glory and our neghbours profet / even to love him with
all our heart / with all our souls / and with all our strength / and our
neghbour as our selves / In the which two points hangs all the law and the
Prophets? Are not we bound then (by gods commandment) to set forth the glory
of god / our neghbours profit / and love to them both? Remember what places of
scripture I have pointed you to before / concerning this matter.


Standish. Before whom should we set it forth? before god? he knowoth our
profession before.


Couerdale. What then? Acto. xxliij
Study allwaye to have a clear conscience toward god and men / after the
Apostles ensample.


Standish. Before man? So we may have good works as the pharisees had / et cet.


Couerdale. Though Pharisees do their works to be seen of men / Matthew. vj
will you therefore (being a preacher) not give good ensample to other / j. Pet.
v.
ner let your light so shine before men / that they saying your good works /
may give the glory unto god? What? Matthew. v
are ye so far from the knowledge of this geer / and yet a preacher / a reader
/ and a post of the church? Who would think / that you (which are so well
aquaynted with him that can compare the dear blood of Christ to the stinckynge
blood of a swyne) should be so far from the understanding of such things? O
wicked hogs / whom Satan has possessed of that sort. Is the worthy prince
of our redemption come to that worship among you? No maruaill that ye are
so blinded in your understanding / for there was never enemy of Christ's blood
/ that had yet any clear judgment in his word / till he ernestly repented /
and gave him self wholly to the study and life that it teaches.


Barnes. I Believe that there is a holy church / and a company of all them that
do profess Christ.


Standish. Allbe it that every true Christian ought thus to believe / et cet.


Couerdale. Ye say / that every true Christian ought thus to believe / and yet
ye call the same belefe erroneous and damnable. Is the Christen believe
erroneous and damnable? Or is it erroneous and damnable to believe / as every
Christen man ought to believe? Thus are ye not only contrary to your self /
but judge Christen men also to be heretics.


Standishe. Diversity*
For you judge (as appears by your preaching) et cet.


Couerdale. D. Barnes words are plain enough. He goes no farther then the
article of your creed / if ye be a Christen man. What will ye more? Do these
his words judge any good man to be none of Christ's church? Or be they good
men / that profess not Christ?


Standish. For it can not be / but either your sect or the other be the
malignau^t church.


Couerdale. But so it is that ye which are of another sect / To make up the
argument.
blaspheme Christ's blood / Ergo ye are of the malignaunt church.


Standish. Two contraries can not stand both in one.


Couerdale. It is not reason that they should / and yet can ye bring it so to
pas / for ye can prately well grant to a thing in one place / and deny the
same in another / as I told you often before.


Standish. Hinc Iacobi. iij. Nunquid fons de eodem foramine / et cet.


Couerdale. It follows a little after (even in the same place) if any man be
wise and endewed with learning among you / Jacob. iij.
let him show the works of his good co^uersacio^ / in the meekness that is
coupled with fear. Which text does utterly confute your former doctrine / that
will not have us do good works / to set forth our profession.


Standish. Vnde.ij. Corinth. vj. Que societas luci ad tenebras? et cet.


Couerdale. It follows immediately in the text / ij. Cor. vj.
What part has the beleuer with the infidel? How accords the temple of god
with images? Now might I ask this question also of you / How do these places
of scripture (that ye have now alleged) agree to the confutacion of. D. Barnes
words / which says / I do believe / that there is a holy church and a company
of all them that do profess Christ?


Standishe. Whereby ye prove your self both an heretic and a traytoure.


Couerdale. Do ye lay heresy and treason to him / for beleuyng that there is a
holy church / and a company of all them / that do profess Christ? Says he
here any thing else? And do ye not confess your self / that every Christen
man must thus believe / if he will be saved?


Standish. Making by your deuelish doctrine not only us to be the malignaunt
church.


Couerdale. To believe that article of the Creed which. D. Barnes here affirms
/ is no doctrine to make you of the malignaunt church / but your blaspheminge
of Christ's dear blood / your defacinge of his glory / your wresting /
perverting and belieng of his holy word / and disagreyng from the wholesome
doctrine thereof / makes you ye may know what / by. S. Paul's words.j. Timo.
vj.

Ye play here with. D. Barnes (though he be deed from this body) as the false
Prophet Sedechias did with Michee / Who when he had exhorted the king not to
break gods commandment / this Sedechias stepte forth (among four hundred of
his sect) and smote Michee upon the cheke / and said / What / has the sprete
of the lord forsaken me / and spoken unto the? ij. Par. xv^ij
Even thus do ye with the deed / whom though ye may not hurt with your fist /
yet do ye your worst with your tongue against him. Notwithstondinge ye shall be
of the malignaunt church still for all your facyng and bragginge (ye though ye
had ten thousand times four hundred false Prophets of your side) solonge as
ye resist the manifest truth of god.


Standish. But also our head the Kings graces majesty and his honorable
counsel.


Couerdale. I darre say / that the Kings highness and his noble counsel
does judge no malignite to be imputed unto them / when any subject believes
that there is a holy church / for they know / that it is an article necessary
to be believed of all Christen men. A pyke thank.
Wherefore this cauillacio^ declares you planely to be but a pike thank in
this behalf. Well yet remember the end of Sedechias / the storye is written
for your warnyng. And verily like as mine humble expectacion in the Kings
highness does persuade me / so heard I a very famous and prudent counsailour
of his (who yet is alive) say within these few years / that of all princes
living his grace is the greatest enemy to flatrers / when he ones has
thoroughly spied them.

The King also has received his hie and suppreme office of god / to defend
the word / the faith / the congregation and church of god within his dominion
/ and is no mayntener of any such malignaunt church / If your doctrine come to
light / it will doutlesse declare the same.


Standish. By whose laws you be now justly condemned to be burnte.


Couerdale. By what law he was condemned / I wot not / no more than I can tell
what point of treason was laid unto him. But sure I am / that like as the
civil laws of every realm (except the prince grant his pardon) condemn
such as are accused by the mouths of many witnesses / so do false witnesses
often times bring to death / even innocent persons / as ye se by the story of
Naboth / of Susanna / iij. Reg. xxj Danie. xiij. Acto. vj. Matthew. xxvj
of holy. S. Steven in the acts and of our Savior Christ / Ye clean
contrary to the judges mind. Nevertheless though Cain slaye Abel in the busshes
/ yet will murthur come out at the last.


Standish. But now to speak of this part of your belefe / et cete.


Couerdale. What is the holy church and company of the^ that profess Christ /
The holy church.
but that true and faithful church which is ruled by the holy ghost acording
to gods promise? even the congregation of the elect and chosen children of god?
What else can ye justly gather of. D. Barnes words / but he confesses the same
/ when he says / I believe that there is a holy church? et cete.


Standish. For this is the company that profess Christ with their mouth / et
cet.


Couerdale. So they do also with other good fruits as well as with their mouth.
Now if this company of Christ's church do profess Christ with their mouth /
then have they some iniunctio^ of god so to do / for without his commandment
/ will they do nothing / ner consent to that / Profession set forth with the
mouth.
which they know not to be his will. And thus have ye proved your self at the
last / that it is not erroneous to say / how that god has commanded us to do
good works for the setting forth of our profession. Had it not been more
worship to you / for to have granted the same at the first / the^ now with
shame to affirm it that ye denied before?


Barnes. ANd that all that have suffered and confessed his name / be saints /
and that all they do praise and laud god in heaven / more then I or any man's
tongue can express.


Standishe. As you do take it / this is also erroneous / et ce.


Couerdale. What so ever the cause were that he was put to death for (whereof I
am ignorant) it is no evil token of a Christen man / at the very point of his
death (among other articles of the creed) to confess / that such a holy church
there is / which professes the name of Christ / and is content to laud and
praise it / and to live and die in his cause. Nether is it erroneous thus to
say. Of arrogauncye that ye lay to. D. Barnes charge / I have talked with you
before.

Touching martirs / Like as we have cause sufficient to praise god daily for
his word mynistred unto us by those martyrs that ye here have named / and for
all such as be true folowers of the^ / So have we no little occasion to lamente
and be sorry / that any man betaking himself to godliness / and making a
covenant with god to live unfeignedly after his word / God warns us by other
men's fall.
should not profess the same in true fidelite and good works / Our lord be
praised yet / which through the fall of other men / has warned us to beware of
unthankfulness. For when they that pretend to be setters up of godliness /
are either ypocrites to god / untrue in the effaires of their prince /
maynteynours of pride / of ydillnesse / of swearyng / of excess / and of
aduoutrye in them selves or in their household servants / Gods good word
must weere the papyre / and be jack out of service from other men. Now god show
the right.


Barnes. ANd that always I have spoken reverently of saints / and praised
them / as much as scripture wylled me to do.


Standishe. Here he planely shows himself to be an heretic / et cet.


Couerdale. I am sure that Christ's church has made no such ordinance /
nether given any sentence or judgment / that men shall not speak reverently of
saints / nether that men shall praise them otherwise / then scripture
teaches. How shows he himself the^ to be an heretic in this behalf / that
follows the example of Christ's church / and not of your unholy synagoge? What
makes your diffinicio^ of heresy / to prove / that he is an heretic / The
diffinicion of heresy.
which not only speaks reverently of saints / but also prayseth them
acordinge to the rule of scripture? Verily your diffinicion comes out at an
importunite. Ye might also have diffyned it thus / and have said / (...)
deducitur (...) / j. volo. decerno. That is to say / I will so have it / I am
at a full point. For truly I se little in your writing but wilfulness / and
obstinate resisting of the manifest truth. Well / god is able to bridle you.


Standish. Also in this his saienge that he will do nothing but that scripture
byddeth him / he planely goes against scripture / et cet.


Couerdale. Is he not a worthy Apostle / legate / or messau^ger / that having
commission of his prince what to say in his message / will speak things of
his own head / or more then his master commands him? Forsoith he declare
manifestly whose Apostle ye be. But now let us se how the scriptute will
maintain this spiritual treason (even treason verily / and no better) against
the King of all Kings and lord of all lords.

Ioh. xx.
Christ our Sauyoure says unto his Apostles these words / As my living
father sent me / so send I you. How did his father send him? My doctrine
(says he) is not mine own / John. vij. Mat. xxviij
but my fathers that has sent me. Therefore (says he) go ye your way / and
teach all nations / and baptize them / et cet. and teach the^ to keep all
things what so ever I have commanded you. j. Cor. iiij
Ought not stewardes to be faithful mynistres of their masters goods / to
pay every man good money as they be commanded / and not to give false coin
in stead of silver and gold? Must we not continue in the doctrine of Christ /
ij. Ioh. j. j. Pet. iiij.
and speak that thing which is agreeable to gods word? Your doctrine would have
us to run at ryote / and not to keep us with in the bounds that god has
appointed us?


Standish. So that here he proves himself to have another propertye of an
heretic / which is to go about with the word of god / to destroy the word
of god / et cete.


Couerdale. Like as ye prove not here with what text of scripture. D. Barnes
should go about to destroy the scripture / so declare ye manifestly by this
your opynio^ and wrestinge of the text / to be one yourselfe / that with the
word of god / goes about to destroy the word of god. Now to your three
places that ye bring out of gods word.

Where find ye in the fiftenth chapter of the acts / Acto. xv.
that we must obey more then holy scriptuture byddeth us? First. S. Peter
confesses there in that cou^sail / that it is a te^pting of god to lay any
yock of the ceremonies of Moses law upon the necks of Christ's disciples / or
to trouble the weak consciences of those which lately we returned and
converted to the faith / And before in the same place he confesses / that god
appointed and ordained him to preach the word of the gospel / and makes
mention of none other doctrine. Again / Acto. xv. Galat. ij.
like as by the come^ consent of the Apostles in the same cou^sail ye se /
that they would not be brought in to subjection / Acto. xv. Gala. ij.
ner give place to those false brethern that would have brought in ceremonies
of the law / to bind men's consciences withal / So would they not that the
brethren which were turned to Christ / should abuse their liberty in him / but
absteyne from certain meats for offendinge of the weak / Roma. xiiij j. Cor.
viij.
which thing also. S. Paul requires ernestly in his Epistles.

In the xvj chapter of the Acts Paul and Silas preach the word of the lord /
and when Paul saw that to circumcise Timothye was a thing which might be done
for the time / and was not required of the Jews as a thing necessary / he was
content / Whereby it is manifest / that like as in things indifferent they had
allwaye respect to the time in forbearinge weak conscientes for a while / so
preached they none other doctrine but gods only word.

In the second chapter of the second Epistle to the Thessalonians. S. Paul
(when he has told them of the great departing from the faith) does give
thanks to god for calling the^ to his truth of the gospel / in the which he
requires the^ to stand steadfast / and to keep such ordinances as he and the
other Apostles had taught the^ either by mouth or by epistle.

Acto. xv.
Now let me demand of you this question / In the xv. of the Acts when Peter
preaches the word of the gospel / and forbyddeth the binding of weak
consciences with supersticious things / and consents (with the other
Apostles) to have such a charitable respect to the time / Is that as much as
to will / that men shall obeie more then is grounded in scripture?

In the xvj. of the Acts / Acto. xv^*
when Paul and Silas preach the word of the lord / and deal gently with the
consciences of the weak acordinge to the time / will they that men shall obeie
more then holy scripture teaches them?

ij. Tessa. ij. When. S. Paul requires them to stand steadfast in the truth
of the gospel / ij. Tessa. ij.
and to keep such ordinances as he and the other Apostles had taught the^
either by mouth or in their Epistles / wills he them to obey more then is
contained in holy scripture?

Thus is it euydent where about ye go / namely / even by your false alledginge
of such places of gods word / to destroy the word of god. This is verily (as
ye say your self) the propertye of an heretic / and this propertye learn ye
of the father of all heresye / even father Satan / Who by (angelis suis
mandauit / et cete.) would prove / Matthew. iiij
that a man may tempte his lord god.

But like as Satan / wrestyng that place of scripture which made most against
him / was commanded by our Savior to avoid / so be ye sure / that your
false doctrine can not stand. Dawlbe your wall and spare not / Ezech. xiij
for Ezechiel tells you planely / that god will send such a shower of rain
among all lyeng / prophets / as shall overthrow it. Your labor is but lost
/ so long as ye dawlbe your wall with vntempred mortar.


Standish. Also where he says that he has ever spoken reverently of saints
/ et cet.


Couerdale. Ye granted before / his words to be true when he said / that all
such as for confessyng Christ's name and for his sake do suffer death / are
saints in heaven. This reverent talking and praysinge of saints did ye allow
before / Diversity.
And now contrary to your own words ye say / that ye wot not whether he
ever spoke reverently of them or no / Yet confess ye that ye have heard him
fortye times. Who will now trust you / that are so double in your words?


Barnes. ANd that our lady (I say) she was a virgyn immaculate and undefiled
/ and that she is the most purest virgyn that ever god created / and a vessel
elect of god / of whom Jesus Christ should be borne.


Standish. Here yet ignorauntly / et cete. he goes forther then the scripture
speaks / et cet.


Couerdale. Be these his words out of the bounds of scripture / or not
acording to the scripture? Read them over again.


Standishe. He would never willingly grant any thing but that is in
scripture.


Couerdale. Then like as ye prove him to have been a true messaunger of god in
grauntinge to the holy scripture (which by your own confession is gods very
word) so declare ye / What a report Standish gives of. D. Barnes.
that if he revoked any thing that is in it / or granted ought contrary unto
it / It was done against his will. Have ye not now a great cause to make such
tryumphinge of reuocacions in your sermons?


Standish. Albeit here with the church he does profess / that our lady did
continue a virgin still / et cete.


Couerdale. Does not the scripture affirm this doctrine / that the mother of
our Sauyoure is the purest virgin that ever god created? Will not the
Prophecies of Christ's birth / the perfourmau^ce of the same / and the
practices of the holy ghost in Christ's blessed mother / allow this doctrine?
Esaie. vij Matthew. j Luc. ij
Have ye noted the work of god in her no better? If she had any need of you /
ye show her but a faynte frendshippe / in reportynge that her most pure
virginite has none other ground but the auctorite of your church. Verily such
your doting doctrine will make both you and your church be less set by.


Standish. Deus.n. tantam eam fecit / inquit quidam / et ce.


Couerdale. Is not your doctrine now well sealed with butter? When ye have
presumed to co^troll gods word / and to call the blessed mother of Christ with
other names then the holy ghost gives her / Now to ratifye and confirm your
false matter / ye bring in an heretic to help you. Can not Christ's worthy
mother keep still the gracious names that the holy trenite has given her / but
she must now have a sort of heretical Ruffyans / to become new godfathers
unto her? Call her (as gods word teaches you) full of grace / blessed /
immaculate virgin / et cete. Pray to god that ye may follow the footsteps
of her constant faith / her fervent charity and godly love / her most meke and
humble behaueoure / her unfeigned truth / et ce. And when ye talk in matters
of Christ's religion / bring forth plain and manifest words of his scripture
/ and no Romysh heretic / ner a text out of frame / to prove your purpose
withal.


Barnes. THen said. M. Sheriff: You have said well of her before. And he
being afraid that. M. Sheriff had been or should be agreued with any thing
that he should say / said: M. Sheriff / If I speak any thing that you will me
not / do no more but becke^ me with your hand / and I will straight way hold my
peace. For I will not be dishobedient in any thing / but will obey.


Standishe. Now as he faineth he would give no slander or offense / Sed sero
sapiunt Phriges.


Couerdale. At this point ye are with. D. Barnes / that (though he be out of
this life) yet what so ever he said in this protestacion / or did at the time
thereof / ye judge him to the worst / and slander him / But your own proverb
that ye bring in / Serve veni^
does admonish you / that it is to laite / for though ye belie him and
slander him never so much / it can not hurt him.


Standishe. Now he says he is afraied to displease (irep^ dauerunt timore vbi
non erat timor) et cete.


Couerdale. Like as ye refer to him the words which are not his own / so
report ye of him / that he was afraid where no fear was. But was there no
fear at the fire side? Standish is a manly man
The manhood of our savior Christ feared death / and so did that holy King
Ezechias. As for you / ye must needs be of some bold and stowte kind / that
can kill a deed man.

But how serves those words of the Psalm to this your purpose? Standish
peruerteth the words (...) the xiij Psalm.
The holy ghost speaks of such wicked workers as eat up gods people like bred
/ call not upon god / are afraied to se god stand on ryghteous men's side / and
mock poor me^ for putting their trust in god. How makes this scripture now
to prove / that there is no fear / where a man seyth death present before his
eyes? O wicked mockers with gods holy word.


Standish. Now se I pray you how obedient he says he will be / which before
time was ever dishobedient / et cete.


Couerdale. An ensample of obedience in. D. Barnes.
Ye say much and prove little touching this man / whose present protestacion
(and his book written before) declares planely his obedience toward his prince
/ whose wholesome commandment if he have at any time disobeyed (contrary to
this his doctrine and example) I am the more sorry. But yet have ye not proved
it to be so.

Touching bishops (which are to be esteemed acordinge to their estate) I wot
not what dishobedience ye have to prove against him. Such bishops as labor
in the word of god and in the doctrine thereof / j. Timo. ^
are to be counted worthy of double honor / therefore in herkenyng unto such
/ he did well / and if he dispysed such / Matthew. x
he despised Christ. But if he followed. S. John's bydding / ij. John. j
and did not receive such false Apostles as bring not the doctrine of Christ /
then can ye not justly blame him.


Barnes. AFter this / there was one that asked him what he said of the
sacrament of the altar. Then said he unto. M. Pope which was there present:
M. Pope / ye know and. M. Rich if ye be alive / that there was one accused
before my lord chaunceloure for denyeng of the sacrament: and for fault of a
better / I was assygned to the examynacion of him in the galery. And after
long reasonyng and disputacio^ I declared and said / that the sacrament being
rightly used and according to scripture / does after the word spoken by the
pressed / change the substance of the bred and wine in to the body and blood of
Christ. Were not these my words? (said he) Ye said. M. pope. The^ bear me
witness (said he) that I err not in the sacrament.


Standishe. Allthoughe you did not deny that sacrament / yet have you / et cet.


Couerdale. Ye call it slanderous raylinge / when a man with gods word both
ernestly rebuke such horrible abuses / as Antichrist and his malignaunt church
has brought in among Christen people / So loathe are ye to consent unto gods
word / or to use any thing according to his holy institucio^. What could it
then have helped you / if he had opened his mind farther / seeing that in his
so godly and honest request / ye ascribe naughtynesse unto him? Standish would
not have the sacrament used acording to the holy scripture.
He did but show that he would have the sacrament rightly used and acording to
holy scripture / and ye are not content with him. Yet well worth the
Corinthians / for though they were fallen in to abuse about this holy mystery
/ and about other things / we read not that they spurned against the holy
ghost (as you do) when they were called to refourmacion.


Standish. Se also I pray you / how he says / et cetera.


Couerdale. If you should say / that for lack of a better / ye did write
against this protestacion of. D. Barnes / would ye therefore be judged to think
/ that there were not many better learned men in England to take such a matter
in hand / then you?


Barnes. THen said he: have ye any thing else to say? There was one then
asked him his opynion of prayeng to saints. Then said he: Now of saints you
shall hear mine opynion. I have said before somewhat (I think) of them / how
that I believe they are in heaven and with god / and that they are worthy of all
the honor that scripture wills them to have. But I say through out al
scripture we are not commanded to pray to any saints: therefore I can not ner
will not preach to you / that saints ought to be prayed unto. For then should I
preach you a doctrine of mine own head.


Standish. There is an old heresy that says / saints be not yet in heaven /
et cet.


Couerdale. Is this your next way to confute him that says / we are not
commanded in scripture to pray to any saints? Ye brawll with the deed man /
that says nothing against you / in this article of saints being in heaven.


Standishe. How can it be in scripture (thou impudent heretic) the prayer unto
saints?


Couerdale. Be good to the poor man / and take not the matter so whote. He
goes not about to prove / that your prayeng to saints is grounded in
scripture.


Standish. As for in the time of the old law / et cet.


Couerdale. The doctrine of god is / Apoc. xiij
that Christ is the lamb which has been slain sens the beginning of the
world / that is / even he / whose power and deliverance has cleansed and
saved all the^ / that ever put their trust in him. Christ Jesus yesterdaie and
todaie / and the same contynueth for ever. Heb. xiij.



Standish. Therefore concerning praieng to saints / et cet.


Couerdale. Must we believe the testimony of men / without it be grounded on
gods word? Are ye become such an Apostle? j. Cor. xiiij. j. Ioh. iiij j.
Tessa. v
Because the church and congregation of Christ must discern / judge / try and
examen all manner of doctrine (and so to eschew the evil / and keep the good)
has it therefore auctorite to make any new article or to receive a doctrine
contrary to gods word? Ioh. xiiij and xvj.
Because Christ has promised his holy sprete of truth to be allwaye in his
faithful congregation / shall they therefore make / ordeyne / set up / or
believe ought that is contrary to his own teachinge?


Standish. Do thou set no more by the auctorite of it then so / in as much as.
S. Augustyne said / Non crederem Euangelio nisi crederim Ecclesie? et cet.


Couerdale. Even as ye peruerte the words of holy scripture / Standish
peruerteth S. Augustines words.
so do ye with. S. Augustine / As ye choppe and change with it / so do ye with
him. And as ye allege the scripture for another purpose then the plain
circumstaunce of the text means / so do ye here with this holy doctoure. For
your purpose is with. S. Augustines words to prove / that your church by her
auctorite / may make new articles / and that we are bound to believe as she
believes / though the same be not grounded in scripture. But if men diligently
mark. S. Augustynes saying / the occasion of his writing / and the
circumstaunce thereof / it shall be euydent / that ye are as like him in
understanding / as the moon is like a grene chese.

S. Augustyne perceiving the great hurt that was growyng through the doctrine
of wicked Manicheus / took in hand to confute him and his sect / The sect of
the Manichees.
his errors were so noisome and deuelish. For he had not only feigned a new
gospel of his own / and named himself Christ's Apostle / but also maintained
the heresy (which the Anabaptists lately held) that the son of god took
not the nature of man of the blessed virgin / and denied rulers to bear office
/ denied marriage / denied certain kinds of meats to be of god / or to be
granted unto Christen men / Taught also that some men's souls dye with the
bodies / despised the exterior word of god and mynistracion thereof / and
sought other visions without it / And many other fond and wicked opynions had
he / unknown to the holy church and flock of Christ. Contra Epistolam Manichei
/ quam vocant fundamenti.


Now for the refelling of such pestilent doctrine. S. Augustine (among other
things) wrote one special book against a certain Epistle of the Manichees /
which was called Epistola fundamenti / and when he had showed the occasions
which moved him to abide still within the unity of Christ's catholic church /
then in the fifth chapter he showed the cause / that moved him / rather to give
credence unto Christ's gospel / then to Manicheus / where among other he
says these words / Nostis. n. me statuisse / nihil avobis prolatu^ temere
credere / et cet. S. Augustines words.
For ye know (says he) that I am determined to give no haistie credence to
any thing that ye speak of your own heads. I demand therefore / Who is
that Manicheus? Ye answer / An Apostle of Christ. I believe it not. Now what
can thou say / or do / thou shall not opteine / for thou dyddest promise
knowledge of the truth / and now thou will compel me to believe the thing that
I know not. Ego vero Euangelio non crederem / nisi me catholice Ecclesie
commoueret auctoritas.
Peradventure thou will read me the gospel / and thereby will thou assaie to
affirm the parson^e of Manicheus. If I should find any man then / which as
yet believes not the gospel / what should thou do to him that says unto the
/ I believe not? As for me / I should not believe the gospel / unless the
auctorite of the catholic church did move (teach or warn) me. Seeing that I
was obedient unto them when they said / believe the gospel / why may I not
obeie them when they say unto me / believe not Manicheus? et cet.

The doctrine of. S. Augustine.
By the circumstaunce now of. S. Augustines words / it is evident / first /
that he would believe no such doctrine as men brought up of their own heads.
Secondly / that he would believe no uncertain doctrine / ner that he knew not
to be true. Thirdly / that the occasion which moved him to believe the gospel /
was the whole consent / and auctorite of the catholic or universal church.
Now like as he reports not of them / that they preached any other doctrine
unto him save the gospel / so says he not / that he believed any other
lernyng / save only it. And in confutinge of Manicheus error / he brings
none other doctrine but the scripture / as it is manifest in the same fifth
chapter of his book.

What help have ye now in. S. Augustines words / either to prove praieng to
saints / or that a particular church may by her auctorite make any article
necessary to be believed / Standish choppeth up S. Augustines words.
except it be grounded in scripture? Ye meant somewhat / when ye chopped up. S.
Augustines words of that fashion. It is not for naught that ye so have
perverted his saying / and read it otherwise then it stands in his book. For
these are his words / I should not believe the gospel / unless the auctorite
of the catholic church did move me. Now is (...) as much to say as
vniuersalis. (...)
Which word like as ye leave out in your lectio^ / Franciscus* Maronis.
so follow ye the mind of Franciscus Maronis (such another holy father as was
your inquit quidam) who coming long after. S. Augustine / did gather of these
his forsaid words / that the auctorite of the church is greater then the
auctorite of holy scripture / where as. S. Aug. meant nothing less / but
teaches us / that who so ever brings up any opynion / or sets forth any
doctrine / we shall receive none / but that which agrees with the manifest
doctrine of the universal church of Christ / That is / we shall hold us to
that doctrine / which was taught by the Prophets / by the Apostles / and by
such other as were true folowers of them in Christ's holy congregation and
church.


Standish. Is it not still fundamentum et columna veritatis? et cet.


Couerdale. The universal congregation and multitude of the^ that believe in
Christ / is still the house of god / j. Timo. iij.
the church of the living god / the piler / and stablishment of the truth /
For there dwells god / with his mercy / grace / truth / forgyuenesse / et
cet. Nether did the Apostles contrary to Christ's former institucion / when
they / to set up his name (which then was so sore spurned at) did baptize in
the same / if ye remember well the prerogatyue of holy baptyme / and the
presence of the blessed trenyte therein.


Standishe. Paul the vessel of election m. v. hundert years and more past /
desired the Romans. cap. xv. the Collo. cap. iiij. the Tessa. j. Tessa. v. to
pray for him / et cet.


Couerdale. I turned not over two leafes of your treatise / sens I red these
your words where ye say thus / How can it be in scripture / thou impudent
heretic / the prayer unto saints?

Lord Jesus / what mean ye man? Will ye by scripture prove that thing /
Standish will prove by scripture / the thing that can not be therein.
which (as ye your self confess) can not be in scripture? Do ye not grant
your self / that the holy scripture is the very word of god? Will ye then by
gods holy word prove that thing which can not be therein? Will ye belie the
word of god? Say ye not your self in another place before / that it is an
abominable vice to slaundre it? To what point no to have ye brought that
worshipful doctrine of your unholy mother the malignaunt church? Which
teaches / that we must now pray unto. S. Paul and other saints / because
that he being here in this body did require other men to pray for him and for
all saints. Now is his request such / that if we should fulfill it yet for him
(as well as when he was living upon earth) the^ should we desire god to be good to
his holy saints that are out of this life. And then god save our lady /
help. S. Paul / and conforte sweet. S. Anthony.

A mocker are ye with gods holy word / and a shameful slau^drer thereof / Vain
words require no answer / but reprofe.
therefore as unworthy to be answered unto every vain sentence of your unstable
doctrine / so leave I your long disputacion therein / Desiringe all Christen
readers to note well what scriptures ye bring forth / and to compare the same
unto the open text / and then try / which of our two doctrynes is most
agreeable to gods holy word.

The doctrine of the Prophets / of Christ our Savior / of his holy Apostles
/ and of such as have and do follow them in the catholic or universal church
and congregation of god / Is his holy word and scripture / which (as holy. S.
ij. Timo. iij Holy scripture is suffici^
Paul darre aduowe) is able to instruct us unto salvation / which is through
the faith in Christ Jesus / et cet. If your article therefore of prayenge to
saints that be out of this life / were a thing belonging to salvation / no
doubt the same holy scripture of god would have taught it.

The awncient / firm / stable / and true doctrine of Christ's catholic or
universal church / is this / that like as Christ Jesus took upon him our
flesh and blood (without sin) and delivered us from eternal death and hell
/ Christ is our hie pressed. Heb. jj.
so is he still our merciful and faithful hie pressed in things concerning
god / to make agreement for our sins / and able to socoure such as are
tempted / He is the seat of grace / Heb. v. The seat of grace Heb. vij. Heb.
ix.
to whom if we resort / we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time
of need / he is able also ever to save them that come unto god by him / and
lives ever to make intercession for us / ye and appears now for us before
the face of god.

This doctrine is confirmed by those same textes of scripture that ye bring in
/ j. John. secundo John. xiiij. j Timoth. secundo / and yet without open
scriptures are ye not ashamed to resist it.

Math. vij. Luc. xj. Psalm. xlix. Hiere. xxix.
We are commanded through out all holy scripture (both of the old and new
Testament) to pray unto Almighty god / to call upon him / to make our
peticions unto him / and to ask of him what soever we lack.

Psalm. xc. and cxliiij. Math. vij John. xvj Esaie. xxx.
We have his true and faithful promise / that if we so do / we shall be heard /
we shall have our request / we shall find that we seek / we shall be
delivered / et cet.

We have ensamples innumerable / that all those faithful people whom the
scripture makes mention of / did make their peticions and prayer / to none
other but unto god / while they were in this life. Acto. x and xij
Let Cornelius (whom we spoke of before) and the practice of the prymityue
church bear record.

Shall we now refuse gods holy commandment / think scorn of his loving
promise / despise the ensamples of his catholic and universal church / and
defye gods holy ordinance (as ye do) and run at riote with your doctrine?
Away from us ye wicked / the commandments of our god will we keep / and not
yours. Psalm. cxviij.



Standish. Which took our sins on him (penam pro peccatis) j. Pet. ij. et
cet.


Couerdale. Ye taught before (wresting many scriptures for your purpose) that
every man must satisfy for the punishment belonginge unto sin / Diversity in
Stan^is^ doctrine.
and now ye grant / that Christ took the pain upon him therefore. As much hold
is there at your doctrine / as at an elys tale.


Standish. But we have moo means concerning intercession / et cet.


Couerdale. The scripture is manifest / that every one of us in this life is
bound to pray for another / and daily occasions have we of such peticions and
exhortacions as appertain to our estate. As for praie^g to saints that be
out of this life / Ye have mine answer already.


Barnes. NOtwithstonding whether they pray for us or no / that I refer to
god.


Standish. A good Christian man would have gone no further / then the
congregation of Christ's church / that is to say / in this region the kings
majesty with his learned counsel.


Couerdale. Like as your vnreuerent handling of the holy scriptures before
rehearced / and your wicked doctrine against the same / Standish. excludes
himself.
declares you to be none of Christ's church (unless ye repent / and turn) so
do ye here exempte your self from that holy congregation. Maruaill not
therefore / though (when I se you follow your unholy mother and not Christ's
dear spouse) I call you now and then her own white son.

In this region of England (ye say) the congregation of Christ's church is the
Kings Majesty with his learned counsel. But is this a sufficient
diffinicion? what a comfort is this now for so many of the Kings subjects
(both learned and unlearned) to hear / that they are not of Christ's
congregation? Is it a great consolacion for the foot / to be none of the body?

Ye repute. D. Barnes no good Christen man / because he would not define
whether saints pray for us or no / but referred that unto god / and not to
the Kings majesty and his learned counsel. What will ye make of the Kings
grace? A prince that had rather have secret things referred unto him / then
unto god the only knower of all secrets? Or do ye esteem the Kings learned
counsel to be such men / as will give judgment in things that be not
evident? Or think ye them to be ignorant of the scripture / Prouer. xxv Eccl.
iij.
which forbyddeth men to search out or to meddle with secret things / that god
has not commanded?


Barnes. ANd if saints do pray for you / the^ I trust within this half hour
/ to pray for you. M. sheriff / and for every Christian man living in the
faith of Christ / and dyenge in the same as a saint. Wherefore if the deed may
pray for the quick / then I will surely pray for you.


Standishe. O damnable presumpcion / et cetera.


Couerdale. Because this man trusted through the only mercy of god in Christ /
to pass from this death unto life / ye note damnable presumpcion / arrogaunt
presumpcion / and presumptuous arrogau^cy in him. And because ye may seem to
have scripture to prove / that. D. Barnes would temerously appoynte and
determyne the time himself / for his so saying / ye bring in (quod pater
posuit in sua potestate) as right as a rams horn / and as nigh to the purpose
/ as Paul's steple and mount Falcon. Acto. j.
At the time of the ascension of our sauyoure / when the Apostles were come
together / they asked him and said / Lord / shall thou at this time set up the
kingdom of Israel again? He said unto them / It belongs not unto you to
know the times and seasons which the father has kept in his own power / et
cetera. A like answer to such another question / Mar. xiij Mat. xxiiij
gives he in another place / and says / Of that day and hour knows no
man / no not the angels of heaven / but the father only.

(...). v.
What makes this now to prove / that he which (acordinge to Christ's promise)
trusts to pas from this death to life / does temerously appoint and determine
the same time / day or season which our Sauyoure there speaks of? Or that he
is either presumptuous or arrogaunt / which (acording to the ensample of holy
scripture) is certain and sure / that after the destruction of his body he
has an everlasting dwelling in heaven? ij. Cor. v
Have ye not now alleged the scripture well to the purpose? Ye would have men
believe (as it appears by you doctrine) that when they depart hence / they
shall go from the hall in to the kytchen / or else in to the whole kylle of your
purgatory.


Standish. Look what case he is in / that thus ended his life / et cet.


Couerdale. To prove here that saints pray for us in heaven / ye make a long
disputacion / and with the scriptures ye do as ye were wont. They have love yet
(ye say) and therefore they pray for us / and are our advocates. I answer /
The same places of scripture that ye bring in your self / are most against
you / for they declare manifestly / that it is the office of Christ to make
intercession for us / Heb. vij j. John. ij
and that he is (with the father) our advocate / which opteineth grace for our
sins. The saints then that be in heaven knowinge this eternal will of god /
love us not so / that they desire to be (nether can they be) against it. ij.
Mac. xv The dream of Judas Machabeus


It is a token / that your doctrine has but a weak foundation / when ye go
about to prove it by a dream / ye and that out of such a book as serves not
for the confirmacion of the doctrine of Christ's church / Prolog. in libros
Salomonis.
for though it be red among the stories of other books / yet did not the church
receive it among the Canonical scriptures in. S. Hieroms time.

Nether can ye prove that book laufull by any saying of Christ / Luc. xxiiij
for through out all the new Testament he makes mention of none but of the law
/ the Prophets and the Psalms / John. v
and byddeth not search any other scriptures but such as bear record and
testimonye of him.

The xv of Jeremy proves (as does also the vij / the xj / the xiiij of his
book) that god will not be entreated where his word is trodden under foot /
and where men will needs spurn against it. And verily in all the scripture
could ye not have brought in a more manifest place to confute your own
doctrine / if it be compared to the xiiij. of Ezechiel.

The xvj. of Luke / proves nothing for your purpose / in that Abraham prayed
not to god when he was desired. But like as it proves that there is no
redemption in hell / ner time of acceptable repentance and forgyuenesse after
this life / So proves it evidently / that we ought to hold us to the only
word and scripture of god / and not to look for other doctrynes / visions /
dreams / or reuelacions.

Gene. iiij
The place Apoca. vj. proves that the voice of Abels blood and of such as are
slain for the word of god / cries vengeance from the earth (and under the
altar / as. S. John says in his vision) and that all such as are malicious
persecuters thereof / Matthew. xxiij
are guilty of the righteous blood that is shed upon earth.

Acto. v.
S. Peter's shadow proves your doctrine but weakly / Acto. xix.
except ye can make us believe that there be shadows in heaven. No More does. S.
Paul's napkyn / unless ye can prove / that he has not yet left wiping of his
nose.

But where learn ye to belie the word of god? Where find ye in the scripture /
that Peter's shadow or Paul's napkyng could heal the sick? does the text say
so? Because the people brought their sick in to Peter's shadow / Acto. v.
did it therefore heal them? Peter confesses him self / Acto. iij.
that it was not his own power which made the lame man hole. S. Luke also
reports / that god wrought no small miracles by the hands of Paul. Acto. xix.
And as Christ our savior himself witnesses / that it was not his vesture /
Matthew. ix
but the woman's faith which made her whole (though she touched it) so says.
S. Mark / Mar. xvj.
that the lord wrought with the Apostles / and confirmed the word with tokens
folowinge.

Morouer where as. S. Paul desired to be lowsed / and to be present with Christ
/ Philip. j.
what proves that the praieng to saints? He said in the same place / that it
were more needful for them to have him yet living among them / Which thing
were not so / if this your article were so necessary as ye make it. But Paul's
words shall be true still / for great need have we of many such as he was / if
it were for nothing else / but to preach with his mouth (as he has done in his
Epistles / against your and all other such false doctrines.


Standishe. Nonne confortatus est principatus eorum? Psalm. cxxxviij.


Couerdale. Like as that scripture makes no mention of any such article as ye
ymagen / The Psalm cxxxviij.
so does the content of the^ Psalm set forth the wonderful care and provision
that god makes for us / and teaches us that gods secret counsails and
thoughts are to hie for our capacite.


Standish. Hinc Iero. aduersus vigilantium / et cet.


Couerdale. C. de Isaac.
S. Ambrose says / Christ is our mouth / by the which we speak unto the
father / Our eye / by the which we se the father / our right hand / by the
which we offer unto the father. Without whose intercession / nether we ner all
saints have any thing with god.


Standish. If you say / saints do not hear us / et cete.


Couerdale. iij. Re. viij j. Para. vj Luc. v.vj xj.xvj Math. ix.xij Mar. ij
Matthew. vj
What knowledge the saints have / it is truly above my capacite / but well I
wot / that the scripture of the old testament ascribes only unto god the
knowledge of men's hearts. Whereof the gospells also bear record sufficient /
and so does the first of the Acts. Now is it manifest likewise / that as the
prayer which comes from the heart / is most acceptable / so does our Sauyoure
bid us pray unto our father in secret.

Where as ye bring in the ensample of Abraham and the work of god showed unto
him in this life for to serve your present purpose / It proves / that ye are
an vnreuerent handler of gods word / for the text is plain / that god did
there show unto Abraham (being yet in this life) the destruction of the
Sodomites / of his only accustomate goodness and mercy / Gene. xviij
because Abraham was under his covenant and did faithfully cleue to his promise
/ and because he knew that Abraham would command his children and household /
to keep the way of the lord / et ce. To affirm your purpose then by this
place / is even as much as to go about to prove / that saints in heaven have
children yet and housholdes to teach in the way of the lord.


Standish. Where as the leest of them (qui minor est) et cetera.


Couerdale. Like as of a comparatiue degree ye make a superlatiue / Luce. vij
and wrest the words to Abraham that our Savior spoke of John the baptist /
Even so to the estate that saints be now in / apply ye those words / which.
S. j. John. iij
John speaks of the estate that gods elect shall have at the second
appearinge of Christ / even when they shall be like him / j. Cor. xv
when their bodies shall rise incorruptible as his is risen / Philip. iij
and when he shall change their vile body / that it may be like fashioned
unto his glorious body.

Again / ye said before / that there were no saints in heaven before Christ's
ascension. And now to prove that the leest of the saints in heaven is more
entyerlye beloved of god / then Abraham was in this life / ye allege the
words that were spoken long before the death of Christ. Qui minor est in regno
/ et cet. Remember your self well / what a clarklye part ye play with that
text.

As for sanctorum communionem / it is the declaracio^ of the holy catholic or
universal church of Christ / that they are a company or felashippe of all such
as be sanctified in Christ's blood / and are partakers of his merits / and
members one of another / But no probacion is it / that saints in heaven do
pray for us / if ye note well the descripcion thereof / j. Cor. xij.
by. S. Paul's doctrine.

Now if ye will prove your purpose by the angels offices / then must ye prove
that saints are mynistring spretes / sent for their sakes which shall be heirs
of salvation. Heb. j.
But that will be hard for you to do. Nether does the twentieth chapter of luke
help your matter any thing at al / for (though ye choppe up the text at your
pleasure with the shortest) these are our Saviors words / Luc. xx
The children of this world do mary and be married / but they that shall be
counted worthy of yonder world and the resurrection from the deed / shall
nether mary ner be married / for they can die no more / for they are like unto
the angels / et cet. This answer now of our Savior to the Saducees / as it
confuteth their heresy / so does it prove / that the children of god in heaven
be like the angels / in life / in immortalite / and in that they are as fre
from the necessite of marriage / as the angels be / but it proves not that they
are like angels in all things / for the^ should they have no bodies to be
raised up / at the general resurrection.


Standish. But also that their merits do profit us / as by example we do read
Gene. xxvj. et cetera.


Couerdale. Where as almighty god says unto Isaac (Unto thy sede will I
give all this land / et cet.) because Abraham was obedient unto my voice / Genesis
xxvj
et cet. Upon this are ye not ashamed to say / that the cause is only through
the merits of his father Abraham. Now says not the text so / but thus / Unto
the and thy sede will I give all this land / and will perform mine ooth that
I swear to thy father Abraham / et cet. This scripture then like as it proves
(acording to. S. Galat. iij.
Paul's words) that they which are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham
/ so declares it manifestly / that this same blessing comes of gods promise
in and through the sede of Abraham and Isaac / that is / even through Christ.

But why bring ye in this or any other place of the old Testament to prove /
that the merits of saints in heaven do profit us / seeing ye say your self /
that before Christ's ascension there were none in heaven / and seeing also that
those virtues of Abraham and David were things practiced here and not in
heaven? God is my record / I wonder greatly what ye mean / thus to daly with
his word.

Touching merits I have answered you allreadie / but. S. Paul answers you
better / and says / Romans viij
that god (giving us his dear son) has given us all things with him / and
that in him dwells al fullness / so that we are co^plete in him. Sure I am
also / Col. j.ij
that no true servant of god will be otherwise minded then was holy John
baptist which said / that out of Christ's fullness all we receive grace /
John. j
et cet. and that grace and truth comes by Jesus Christ. If the merits then
that ye speak of / be any part of grace and truth / then must ye needs
grant that we receive them only of him. But surely ye have some ungracious
and false matter in hand.


Standish. He speaks nothing of our works after our iustificacion / but
only of works before faith / which in deed are not meritorius / et cetera.


Couerdale. Before (to prove by Cornelius works that our iustificacion deserved
only by the death of Christ / Diversity in Standish doctrine.
is a false iustificacion) Ye say / that his good works before he was
justified / something deserved that he should be called in to the congregation of
our savior / and so through gods mercy his works did deserve much of
almighty god. These are your own words. And now clean contrary to the same
/ ye grant / that works before faith are not meritorious. Thus by your own
words condemn ye your own doctrine.

But though every good work done in true faith after gods commandment /
shall be rewarded / and has his promise annexed unto it (as if I be merciful
unto my neighbor / Matthew. v xviij. Gala. iij.
god has promised to have mercy on me again) shall that reward be given for
my works sake / and not rather because of his own promise and blessing in Jesus
Christ? Is not all our sufficiency of god? ij. Cor. iij Philip. ij
Can we think a good thought of our selves? Is it not god / which works in
us both the will and the deed? When god rewards any good work / August.
does he not crown his own gifts in us? Stop your mouth then / and
knowledge your self to be in gods danger and in his dett. Romans iij. Ephe. ij
Why boast ye of your merits / against the doctrine of gods word? Why grant
ye not with. S. Luke (whom ye allege your self) that when ye have done all
such things as are commanded you / Luc. xvij
ye are an unprofitable servant? And with. S. Paul / Romans viij
that the pains taken in this life / are not worthy of the glory for to come?
Do ye not say your self also these words / We must think and surely believe /
that all comes of Christ's liberalite / which freely did call us / and love us
before we loved him? What practice then of any wordly prince / can prove this
truth to be false? Your own words and sentences / destroy your doctrine of
merits. Follow. S. Augustines counsel the^ / De predest sane.
and boast not of men's merits / but let the grace of god which reigns through
Jesus Christ / have all the preemynence. And if ye have any works folowinge
the fre and liberal vocation of god / the^ grant with Chrysostom / that they
are his reward and your dewtie / and that the gifts of god are his own
benignite / grace / and greatness of his own liberalite.


Barnes. Well / have ye yet any thing more to say? then called he. M. Shyreffe
/ and said / have you any articles against me / for the which I am condemned?
And the sheriff answered / no. Then said he / Is there here any man else that
knows wherefore I die / or that by my preaching has taken any error? let
them now speak and I will make them answer. And no man answered. Then said he
/ well I am condemned by the law to die / and as I understood by an act of
perliame^t / but wherefore I ca^ not tell / but belike for heresy / for we are
like to be burnt


Standish. Articles against the? What articles dyddest thou revoke at the
spyttle? et cet.


Couerdale. A very spittle fashion is it (no doubt) to ask questions of the
deed. And I suppose verily / that (except it be a co^iurer / a iugler / or a
worker with spretes) there is none that uses it.

Touching articles at the spittle / I am certain / D. Barnes did not affirm
there that faith does not justify / or that Christ's death was not the
sufficient satisfaction for our sins. Now where as he was enjoined to affirm
/ that though Christ be our only mediator / savior / iustifier and only
satisfaction unto god for the sins of them that believe in him / Yet if we
loose this grace through sin / then must we rise again by true pennaunce / et
cet. If for this article (I say) ye will gather that he should revoke / then
do ye interpret his words contrary to his own declaracion that he made of
them in the same sermon. In so much that the sunday after at Paul's cross (as
I understand). D. Wilson could lay no greater thing to his charge / then that
he had expounded pennaunce after his wont manner by the office of the law and
the gospel.

Now like as before in your words ye compare this his confession to the
confession of the deuel / so by this and such other your tawntes / ye would make
the world believe / that he revoked al truth at the spittle field / and that he
had all his life time taught an ungodly and carnal liberty / the contrary
whereof is evident not only by this present protestacio^ / but also by his
writing and preaching before / Namely / that to the true believe and consent of
the heart are necessarily required good Christen fruits in every man and woman's
conversation acording to the same. Wherefore this his confession so long as he
maintained no damnable error contrary unto it (which in all your babbling book
ye have not proved / nether shall be able to do) was a sufficient evidence at his
latter end / that he dyed a true Christen man. Nether can ye justly condemn
him / j. John. iiij.
that makes no worse confession on his death bed. Again. S. John says /
Every sprete which confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh / is of
god. Wherefore ye are to rash in judgment / to affirm that he was justly
condemned for heresy / saying that he nether held any doctrine ner manteined
by evil conversation / any thing / out of which ye can truly / deduce / that
ever he denied the true faith of god / or any one of the benefits or offices
of Jesus Christ.

As for the articles that were laid against him in Cambrige above xij years
agoo / verily like as in repetinge of the^ ye accuse your church to pretend an
outward forgyuenesse / and yet to keep hatred still many years / So appear ye
to favor them that accused him of the said articles / in some whereof he
maintained the prerogatyue of princes against the tiran^ie and usurped power ye
wot of whom. I say no more / but if ye be at that point / and may so freely
write what ye will / I commit my part of the play to god. Who (as I doubt
not) will defend the king in his right / so am I sure / that though ye be now in
your ruff / he is not yet hard aslepe. Where as ye say / that at. D. Barnes
death there were three sorts of men / and that the first sort which (by your
report) were most contrary to him / would give him no answer at his honest
request / Ye declare planely that / either they had nothing to say against him
/ or else little charity / seeing that (acording to. S. P. ij. Cor. xj.
words which ye allege) they found not the^ selves grieved to se the weak
offended / if it were as you say. Nether proves it the^ to lean steadfastly
unto the piler of truth / to love gods law / to have true quietness in their
conscience / or to be endewed with fervent charity / that follow not the same
law of love in the time of need. How do those places of scripture then that ye
bring in / allow their act? Let all indifferent readers judge / how the cxviij
Psalm / the third of the first to Timothe / or the eight to the Romans
agrees with their purpose.

In describing the second sort of people that were at. D. Barnes death / ye
fail also. First / in reporting of the^ / that they ever be and shall be as
apt to receive the euel preaching as the good. Secondly / that they are
content in these matters to go whither they be led. Thirdly / that they are
content to believe what they be taught. Fourthly / that they know not when they
be in the right way / ner when they be forth of it. Matthew. xviij
Now says our sauyoure (in the same text which ye your self do allege) that
they believe in him. Then like as they harke^ to his voice / John. x Roma. viij
j. Ioh. iiij j. Tessa. v John. x
and not to the voice of straunges / so follow they him / and are led of his
holy sprete / And not only prove all doctrines (whether they be of god) but
also keep that which is good / for they know Christ's voice / and not the
voice of strangers.

Morouer / if that third sort of people / did favor no worse opinions / and
were no fuller of fleshly and carnal sensualite / then this present
protestacion of. D. Barnes teaches them / that text (dilexerunt magis tenebras
/ John. iij
et cet.) may rather be verified of you and your sort / then of the^.


Barnes. But they that have been the occasion of it / I pray god forgive them
/ as I would be forgeuen my self. And. D. Stephin. Byschopp of wynchester that
now is / if he have sought or wrought this my death either by word or deed / I
pray god forgive him / as heartily / as freely / as charitably / and without
fayning / as ever Christ forgave the^ that put him to death.


Standishe. Se now whether this be feigned charity / or nor / et cetera.


Couerdale. It is no point of fained charity / a man to forgive them that
offend against him / Matthew. v Luc. xxiij
and to pray for them that persecute him / As it is manifest by our saviors
doctrine / and example also at his death.

Ye take upon you here the office of a judge before ye be called there to / ye
even gods only office (in judging men's hertes) take ye upon you. As who say /
he goes about to overthrow and cast down a man / that agrees not with him
in his doctrine. As touching any contencious manner between my lord of
winchester and. D. Barnes / though you and I both (as I suppose) be ignorant /
what direction the Kings highness did take therein / Yet seeing the one was
reconciled to the other openly at the Spittle / ye should now not take the
matter so whote.

But a pyke thank will ye be still. What mind has he to be revenged / that
first asks a man forgiveness / and than prays god to forgive him (as
Christ forgave his death) if he be guilty? Again / Will the. B. of winchestre
judge him self to be either sediciously or disdainfully named / or without
reverence / when he is called a bisshoppe? I darre say / he will not. Why
play ye Philippe flatrers part the^ / as though the name of a bisshoppe were
not a reverent name?


Barnes. ANd if any of the counsel or any other have sought or wrought it
through malice or ignorance / I pray god forgive them their ignorance and
illumynate their eyes / that they may se / and ask mercy for it.


Standish. O what ignorance? et cetera.


Couerdale. This prayer is nether malicious against gods word / ner prejudicial
to any man / and if they that suffered. D. Barnes to live so long / were to
blame for their so doing / then make ye your self giltye of the same fault /
that have played the coward all that while / and not helped him to his death.


Barnes. I Beseech you all to pray for the kings grace / as I have done ever
sens I was in preson and do now / that god may give him prosperity / and that
he may long reign among you / and after him that goodly prince Edward may so
reign / that he may fynishe those things that his father has begone. I have
been reported a preacher of sedicion and disobedience to the kings majesty /
but here I say to you / that you all are bound by the commandment of god to
obey your prince with all humilite and with all your heart / ye not so much
as in a look to show yourselues disobedient unto him / and that not only for
fear of the swerd / but also for conscience sake before god.


Standish. Thou have been truly reported a sedicious preacher / et cetera.


Couerdale. Will ye then wink at sedicio^ so long / and not be an accuser
thereof / where as (by your own confession) ye have heard him preach so often? Ye
and knowing his book to have been so long prynted? But how untruly ye belie him
/ it shall be euydent to all the world / that will read his book. Ye report
of him / that he should say in his book (prynted ten years agoo) that if the
King would by tyranny take the new Testament from his subjects / they should not
suffer him. Now is it manifest that like as he says here in this part of his
protestacion / so says he also in his book / and brings in the same xiij
chapter to the Romans that ye allege / In the cxiij leaf.
and adds morouer these words / In no wise (be it right or wrong) may
thou make any resistaunce with sword or with hand / et cet. Ite^ / If the King
forbid the new Testament / et cete. men shall first make faithful prayers to
god / and humble supplicacion to the King / D. Barnes words in the cxv leaf
of his book.
that his grace would release that commandment. If he will not do it / they
shall keep their testament with all other ordinance of Christ / and let the
King exercise his tyranny (if they can not fly) and in no wise under pain of
damnacion shall they resist him by violence / but suffer patiently / et ce.
Nor they shall not go about to depose their prince / as my lords the
bisshoppes were wont / In the cxvj leaf.
et cet. But if the king will do it by violence / they must suffer it / but not
obeie to it by agreement. Item / Now is it clear / that we may not resist this
temporal power (in no wise) by violence / et cet. In the cxviij leaf.
but if any thing be commanded us that is against the word of god whereby our
faith is hurt / that should we not do in any wise / but rather suffer
persecucion and also death.

Be these words now as much to say / as if the King command any thing by
tirannie me^ shall not suffer him? What mean ye / so untruly to report of the
deed? But no maruail / when ye shame not to belie so many textes of gods holy
word.

Touching men's laws / it is manifest / that such as are not grounded in gods
word / do not bind the conscience of man to deadly sin. For if they be not
grounded in gods word / and agreeable to the faith thereof / then are they
sinful and naught. Who is bound now to obeie sin? But a man may smell you a
far of / whose successors ye be. You will not stick to call it a laufull
act for a prince / to condemn gods word / and to forbid that thing which is
institute and ordained of god / Ye if our prince would take such a thing in
hand (which god forbid) he should lack no instigacion of your malignaunt
church. Nether can I yet conjecture the contrary / but that ye are about such
a tragedy. Now go to / set your watch men to keep the sepulcher / suffer not
Christ to rise up in any wise / let not the soldiers lack money (the church is
rich enough) cast your great heads together / and let Caiphas give you his
most so tell counsel / For when ye have done your best / and lied all that
ever ye can / yet shall god make your policye to serve for the glory of his
truth / Amen.


Barnes. Ye and I say further / if the king should command you any thing
against gods law / if it be in your power to resist him / yet may you not do
it.


Standish. Se here the steadfastness / et cetera.


Couerdale. This man nether wrote ner said / that we must obey an erthly
prince / more then almighty god / and yet are ye not ashamed so to report of
him. He says / that though the King command us any thing against gods law
/ yet may we not resist him / Which saying ye call an abominable heresy.
Thus declare ye your self manifestly / to be of the nombre of them that teach
/ how that it is lauful for a man to resist his prince. Which thing whether it
be not both heresy and treason / let them judge that have auctorite.

Amos. vij
Because Amos the Prophet preached against ydolatry at Bethel / that false pressed
Amasias (whom ye speak of) told that King / that he was a sedicious fellow /
and so found the means to get him out of the court. Yet played Amasias a more
honest part with Amos / then you do / for he laid rebellion to his charge
that was alive / and your accusacion is against the deed. Again / Amasias
(being yet a false pressed) says not / that it is laufull for a man to resist
his prince / and you call it abominable heresy to teach the contrary.

Though Peter and John do teach / that we must obey and harken unto god more
then unto men / do they therefore teach / that we must resist our prince? Where
find ye that example in them Peter smote of Malcus ear in deed / but little
thank had he for his labor. Does he not teach us to endure grefe / to suffer
wrong / and to take it patiently? Says he not / j. Pet. ij.
that we are called there unto? Sets he not Christ unto us for an example of
suffryng?

Because our Savior wylleth us not to fear them that kill the body / Matthew. x
must we therefore resist them? When a prince does persecute us for gods words
sake in one city / must we resist him / and not rather fly in to another?
Matthew. v
Does he call them blessed that resist / and not them rather that suffer for
persecucion sake? Luc. xxiiij.
Did Christ enter in to his Kingdom by resisting / or by suffryng?

As for that saying (qui timet hominem / et cet. I can not find it in the xix
of the proverbs / but I find there written / Prouer. xix
that a false witness shall not remain unpunished / and that he which
speaks lies / shall not escape.

Ye call it an abominable heresy to teach / that we ought not to resist our
prince / though he command us any unlawful thing. And to prove your purpose
/ ye point us to the fifth of Esaye / where there is no such words as ye speak
of. But these words find I there / Esaye. v
Woe unto them that call good evil / et cet.

As for the ensample of the seven brethren and their mother / it utterly
condemns you / for they say these words / They say not / we are ready to
resist.
We are ready rather to suffer / then to offend the laws of god / et cete.
And as they said / so they did / without making resistaunce / though the Kings
commandment was unlawful. What other thing now did. D. Barnes teach in his
fore rehearced words / but (as he had said in his book before) that if the King
would command us any unlawful thing / we must suffer him / though we obeie
not to it by agreement? What danger you be in then for teaching the contrary /
I will not define. I pray god (acording to his good pleasure) have mercy upon
you.


Barnes. THen spoke he to the shereffe and said / M. shereffe / I require you
of gods behalf / to have me commended unto the kings grace / and to show him
/ that I require of his grace these requests / first / that where his grace
has now received in to his hands all the goods and substance of the
abbayes. Then the shereffe desired him to stop there. He answered / M.
shereffe I warraunt you / that I will speak no harm / for I know it is well
done / that all such supersticion be taken clean away / and the kings grace
has well done in taking it away. But seeing his grace is made a hole king /
and obeyed in his realm as a king (which nether his father ner graundfather
ner his ancestors that reigned before him / ever had) and that through the
preaching of us and such other wretches as we are / which always have applied
our hole studies / and gave our selves for the setting forth of the same / and
this is now our reward. Well / it makes no matter. Now he reigns / I pray
god long may he reign among you. Would god it might please his grace / to
bestow the said goods or some of them to the comfort of his poor subjects /
which surely have great need of them.

The second that I desire his grace / is / that he will se that matrymony be
had in more reverence then it is / and that men (for every light cause
invented) cast not of their wifes / and live in aduoutry and fornicacion / and
that these that be not married / should not abhominably live in whordome /
following the filthy lusts of the flesh.

The third / that the abominable swearers may be punished and strately looked
upon. For surely the vengeance of god will come on the^ for their mischeuous
oothes. The^ desired he. M. Pope which was present / to have him commended to.
M. Edgar / and to desire him for the dear blood of Jesus Christ / that he would
leave that abominable swearing that he uses. For surely except he forsake it
/ he will come to some mischeuous end. The fourth / that his grace will set
forth Christ's true religion. And that seeing he has begon^e / he go forward /
and make an end / for many things have been done / but yet much more is to do.
And that it would please his grace to look on gods word himself. For it has
been obscured with many tradicions invented of our own brains. Now (said he)
how many peticions have I spoken of? And the people said: four. Well / (said
he) even these four be sufficient / which I desire you / that the kings grace
may be certified of them. And say / that I most humbly desire him / to look
ernestly upon them.


Standish. It was high time to look / et cet.


Couerdale. Dani. liij
The prophet Daniel (I trust) was no arrogaunt wretch / though he desired his
prince to make some provision for the poor / j. Timo. vj
No More the^ was holy. S. Paul / which taught Timothy to change the rich me^
of this world with the same lesson. All they also that were true messaungers of
god / labored to have aduoutry / fornicacion / whordome / and abominable
swearinge expelled from among Christen men / as all the whole scripture
testifies. Nether did. D. Barnes in these his words require any other thing.
His words are plain enough / and yet (as your manner is in your treatise) ye
ymagen an intent and mind clean contrary to the same. Ye grant that he spoke
ernestly for the poor and for the commons / and yet call ye him an arrogaunt
wretch / and (for his good will) report of him / that he desired to have a
great stroke in every matter of weight / et cetera.

D. Barnes said not that he and his fellows did refourme those things that
were amysse (for he knew that / to be gods office and the Kings) and yet
surmyse ye the same untruly upon him. But he says that through the preaching
of gods word in the mynistracion of him and such other / the Kings grace is
now more obeyed then / ever he was before. And I pray you / is it not so? Or
was it not gods holy word / that gat the King his own again? May he thank
any papisticall doctrine therefore? No verily.

Concerning. M. Edgar / if. D. Barnes had not had a right good opynion in him /
no doubt he would not have sent him that commendacion with such an honest
request. But because he took him (as he might right well / I trust) for a
gentle man that would suffer a Christen exhortacion / as they will that
perteyne unto Christ / therefore was he the bolder of him. As for that swearing
/ I think verily it comes rather of a custom (which yet might well be left)
then of any set purpose. Nether was. D. Barnes act here against the process
required in the xviij of Matthew / though he had not spoken with him before /
seeing he might not now come at him.


Barnes. ANd that his grace take good head / that he be not disceaued with
false preachers and teachers and evil counsel. For Christ says / that such
false Prophets shall come in lammes skynnes.


Standish. O how great thank be you worthy / et cetera.


Couerdale. Ye should have proved these words to smell nothing but heresy and
treason (as ye say in your preface) because they have the sweet odoure of the
gospel / Math. vij xvj.xxiiij.
where our savior byddeth us beware of false Prophets / and of the leven of
pharisees / and tells us / that many such shall arise / and disceaue many (ye
even through sweet preachinges and flatring words / says the Apostle) and
because the scripture byddeth us beware of such merchants / Nom. xvj. Mar.
xij. Luc. xx.
as going in long garments / et cete. devour wedows houses under the pretense
of long prayers.

This man called not the Kings most honoble council evil / and yet (even
like a pyke thank still) ye surmyse it upon him. If a friend of the Kings should
say unto him / I beseech your grace / take good head whom ye receive in to your
preuy chamber / Does he therefore call his chamberlaynes evil? Or does he
therefore prefer his own wit above the discrete wisdom of the Kings noble
counsel?

Holy. S. ij. Pet. j
Peter (as long as he was in this body) thought it mete / to put Christen men
in remembrance of their dewtie / ye though they were of ripe knowledge them
selves / and stablished in the truth. And yet you call it obstinate pride /
treason / blyndnesse / and rash foolishness so to do. Such is your judgment.
Ye even when the party does most humbly desire his prince / to who^ he
speaks.


Barnes. THen desired he all men to forgive him / and that if he had said any
evil at any time unadvised / whereby he had offended any man / or given any
occasion of evil / that they would forgive it him / and amend that evil they
took of him.


Standish. Mark how he does continue one manner of man / et cetera.


Couerdale. Steadfastness in the way of gods truth is to be commended. And an
evident token is it / that he is of the same doctrine / which wittingly
teaches no evil / reconcyleth himself unto all men / is sorry if he have
offended any man (or given any evil occasion) and gives other men at their
death / an ensample of true repentance.


Barnes. ANd that they would bear him witness / that he detested and abhorred
all evil opynions and doctrines against the word of god / and that he dyed in
the faith of Jesus Christ and the sacraments of the church / by who^ he doubted
not to saved.


Standishe. I know that no good man / et cetera.


Couerdale. Then it appears / that if he had not detested and abhorred all
evil and erroneous opynions / but had loved your strange doctrines (which are
against gods word) and so dyed out of Christ's faith / ye would have been a
record and witness to him / rather then fail.


Barnes. ANd with this he desired them all to pray for him / and then he
turned him about / and put of his clothes / making him ready to the fire / and
most patiently took his death / yeldinge his soul into the hands of
almighty god.


Standish. By this it does appear / that the first writer of these his words
was very charitable / et cete.


Couerdale. What so ever he was that first wrote these his words / verily I
can not tell / nether did I ever read them or hear them / till I saw them in
your treatise. And though it may be suspected that this is not the trewest
copy / because it comes out of your hands / Yet truly a right charitable
deed was it to write his words / and to certifye us of them / for else (by your
present practice) we may conjecture / that ye would have discanted of his deeth
/ as of one whom ye had overcome with your doctrine. Now also that ye can
stop the truth no farther / ye would bear us in hand / that it is the
writers judgment only / which ascrybeth unto him / that he patiently took his
death / as though there were none else that herd him and saw him dye / but the
writer alone.


Couerdale. Allbe it I will judge only of the outward behaueour.


Couerdale. John. vij
Judge not after the outward appearau^ce (says our savior) but give a
righteous judgment.

Yet do ye not as ye say / for in many places of your treatise ye judge the
man's mind and intent ye contrary to his words.


Standishe. Taking occasion by his erroneous words / to judge he dyed an
obstinate heretic.


Couerdale. Ye can not deny / but that after the open confession of his faith
/ and his humble requests unto the Kings grace / he than reconcyled himself
to all men / and at the last when he had desired the^ to pray for him / took
his death patiently / and yielded up his soul in to the hands of allmightye
god. For all this ye do not only call his words erroneous / but also give
sentence / that he dyed an obstinate heretic.


Standish. And as for the inward secrets / whether he be condemned or saved /
whether he yielded up his soul in to the hands of almighty god / or no / et
cet. I remitte that to the secret counsel of the blessed trenite.


Couerdale. A wonderful thing is it / that ye are so unstable in your words.
Do ye not take upon you before / to judge / that he dyed an obstinate heretic?
And now ye can not tell whether he be saved or condemned / whether he yielded up
his soul in to the hands of almighty god / or no. But can an obstinate
heretic yield up his soul / when he is deed all ready? Can an obstinate
heretic be saved? Behold now / to what worship ye bring your doctrine at
the last.


Standish. Unto whom be laud / honor / and glory for evermore. Amen.


Couerdale. Amen. Even to that same blessed trenyte (father / son / and holy
ghost) be honor and glory now and evermore. Amen.

The Apostle describing the office and dewtie of a ministre or preacher of gods
word / ij. Timo. ij.
wylleth him (among all other qualities) to show himself such a laudable
workman / as need not be ashamed / handling the word of truth justly. Wherefore
/ seeing ye have so irreverently handled gods holy word / perverted it / wrested
it and belyed it so often and many times in your treatise / Maruaill not at this
mine inuectyue against your false doctrine. As for simple ignorance / and such
frayll weakness as accompanyeth the nature of man (whether he will or no) it
may be suffered and borne. But wilful spurnyng at gods holy word / froward and
false belieng thereof / must needs be rebuked / and improued. Your zele (for all
your holy pretense) is to suppress gods truth to maintain that doctrine
which the catholic or universal church of christ never received / and to
defend the church malignau^t in her wickedness. This is manifest by your
present practice. But god almighty which sows the sede of his holy word /
and daily increaceth it in the hearts of his faithful / shall (though no man
else will) maynteyne and defend it himself. We also (whom god will not to be
idle) shall do our best / and be carieng stones to the making up of the wall
which ye have broken down / To the intent that Christ our savior may have
his own glory (which ye have robbed him of) our prince his honor / and our
neighbor his dewtie.


To all true Christen readers.
Faint not thou in faith (dear reader) nether wax cold in love and charity /
though the enemies of gods word be gathered together and grown in to such
swarms. Be thou strong in the lord / and in the power of his might. And let
it not discorage the / that the said word is so little in the estimacion of the
world / so greatly despised / so sore persecuted / so wickedly perverted /
wrested and belyed / so unthankfully received / so shamefully denied / and so
slouthfully followed.

Arm thy self therefore with the confortable ensamples of the scripture / And
as touching those ioly Nimrottes that persecute gods word / hunting it out of
every corner / whetting there swerdes and bendyng their bows against it / Be
thou sure / that the god of our fathers Abraham / Isaac and Jacob shall do
with the^ as he ever was wont to do with tirauntes in times past. Thou seist
through out the stories of the holy bible / how that like as he turns some of
their hearts from cruelty to meekness / Eue^ so with death / with fire / with
water / and with such other his plages destroys he them that will needs
despise his warninge / Ye breaks their bows in pieces / and kills the^
with there own swerdes. As for Iamnes and Iambres those wicked sorcerers and
covetous chaplens that teach contrary to gods word / and dissuade the great
me^ of the world from it / Their own wrestinge and belyeng of it must needs
confound the^ / For though there be many that resist the truth / yet when it is
uttered and comes to light / their madness (as. S. Paul says) shall be
manifest unto all men. And as Moses rodd devoured their rods in the Kings
presence / So likewise the same places of scripture that they allege for their
wicked purpose / shall destroy their false doctrine in the face of the world.
Ye even as little honesty as the papistry has gotten by wresting of (Tu es
Petrus et cet.) so small profit are they like to have for belyeng of other
textes. Nether is it to be feared / but god will do for one part of his word
as much as for another / when he seith his time.

Concerning those belly beasts / that (for no commandment ner promise of god /
for no example / warnyng ner exhortacion) will be counsayled / but still
blaspheme his holy word through their ungodly conversation / let not that
withdraw the from the way of righteousness. Love not thou Christ the worse /
though Judas be a traytoure. Set not thou the less by his wholesome doctrine /
though dogs turn to their vomit / and though swine walow in their stinking
mire again.

I know (gentle reader) that to all true Christian hearts / it is a great
tentacio^ / to se gods holy word either persecuted / belyed / or unthankfully
received. But first remember thy self well by the practyse of all stories /
when was it without persecucion? When was there not one tyrant or other / that
exercised all his power / strength / wit / and counsel against it? When
were the children of Israel without some bloody Edomites / Egiptians Assirians
/ Babilonians / Philistines / or other?

Secondly / When was not gods word belied / perverted or evil spoken of by
one false Prophet or other? Were there not heretics and flatringe chaplens in
all ages / that withdrue men from the truth / and misreported the straight
ways of the lord? Thirdly / when were there not some multitudes / that
prete^ding a love toward Christ's word / did but follow him for their own belies
sake? when was the sede of Christ's word sowe^ / but some part of it fell upon
the stony ground where it withred / and among the thorns that choked it up?

Wherefore seeing thou art compased about with so great a nombre of witnesses /
Heb. xij
that is to say / with the ensamples of so many godly and holy me^ / which not
only did chose rather to suffer aduersite with the people of god then to
enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season / but also eschued false doctrine
and brought forth allwaye good works in their living / follow thou the same
trade / follow thou them (I say) as thou seist they followed Christ / and no
farther. And as touching any manner of doctrine / believe no man without gods
word / acording as. S. Hierome counceleth the. In Epistolam ad Gal. ca. v. For
certain it is / that like as many times thou shall spy even great faults in
the conuersacio^ of gods elect / so read thou of very few teachers sens the
Apostles time / which have not erred (and that grossly) in sundry things.

Wherefore whom so ever thou hear teach / preach or write / or whose books so
ever thou read / try them by gods word / whether they be agreeable there to
or no. When thou know them (I say) and art certain and sure by Christ's
doctrine / that they are false / sedicious or abominable / then hold them
accursed / avoyde them utterly / eschew them in any wise / and give over thy
self to the wholesome hearing and readinge of the scripture. But so / that thou
be sober and discrete in the knowledge and use thereof / And that in confessing
the true faith and believe of Christ / thy heart mouth and deed go together / and
that thou consent to none opinion contrary to the same / That god may have the
praise / and thy neighbor be edified in all thy conversation. So doing / thou
shall not only stop the mouth of evil speakers / but also allure and
provoke other men to be frutefully given to faith and good works / and to
help (with such their unfeigned faith and godly living) that the tabernacle of
god may be set up again. The grace of our lord Jesus Christ be with us all.
Amen.

Iacobi. iij. If ye have a bitter Zele / and there be contencions in your
hearts / make no boast / nether be liars against the truth.
