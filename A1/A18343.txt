This first chapter of the first tractate shows under what king the play of
the chesse was founden and maad.:.
Among all the evil conditions and signs that may be in a man the first and
ye grettest is when he feereth not / ne dredeth to displese and make wroth god
by sin / and the people by living disordynatly / when he reccheth not / ner
takes head unto them that repreue him and his vices / but sleeth them / In
such wise as did the emperor Nero / which did do slay his master seneque
For as much as he mig^^^ (...) suffer to be repreuid and taught of him In like
wise was sometime a king in babilome that was named Emsmerodac a Iolye man with
out Justice and so cruel that he did do hew his faders body in three honderd
pieces / And gaf hit to ete and devour to three honderd birds that men call
voultres And was of such condition as was Nero / And right well resemblid and
was like unto his fader Nabogodonosor / which on a time would do slay all the
sage and wise men of babylonye / For as much as they could not tell him his
dreme that he had dremed on a night and had forgoten hit like as it is wreton
in the bible in the book of danyell / Under this king than Emlmerodach was
this game and play of the chesse founden / True it is that some men wene /
that this play was founden in the time of the bataylles and siege of troy But
that is not so For this playe-cam to the plays of the caldees as dyomedes the
greek says and reherceth. That among the philosophrs was the most renomed
play among all other plays / And after that / cain this play in the time of
Alixandre the great in to Egipte And so unto all the parties toward the south
/ And the cause wherefore this play was so renomed shall be said in the third
chapitre.

This second chapitre of the first tractate shows who fond first the play
of the chesse.
This play fond a philosopher of Thoryent which was named in Caldee Exerses
or in greek philometor / which is as much to say in english as he that
loves Justice and mesure / And this philosopher was reno^^d greatly among the
greeks, and them of Athenes which were good clerkys and philosophers also
renomed of their comiynge This philosopher was so Just and true that he had
leuyr dye than to live long and be a fal^ flaterer with the said king For
when he beheld the foull and sinful life of the king / And that no man durst
blame him. For by his great cruelte he put them all to death that displesid
him / he put him self in paryll of death / And louyd and chees rather to dye
than longer to live: The evil life and diffamed of a king is the life of a
cruel best / And ought not long to be sustained / For he destroys him that
displesith him / And therefore reherceth valeriuds / that there was a wise man
named theodore cerem whom his king did do hang on the cross for as much as
he repreuyd him of his evil and fowll life And all way as he was in the torment
he said to ye king / upon thy counceyllours and them that been cladd in thy
clothing and robes were more reason that this torment should come / For as much
as they dar not say to the The truth for to do Justice right wysly / of my
self I make no force whether I dye on the land or on the water or otherwise
etc as who says he recched not to dye for Justice / In like wise as democreon
the philosophre put out his owen eyes be cause he would not see that no good
might come to the evil and vicyous people with out right And also defortes the
philosophre as he went toward his death / his wife that followed after him said
that he was dampened to death wrongfully / than he answered and said to her /
hold thy peace and be still / hit is better and more merytorye to dye by a
wrong and unrightful Judgment / than that I had deseruyd to dye.

The third chapitre of the first tractate treteth wherefore the play was
founden and maad.
THe causes wherefore this play was founden ben three / the first was for to
correct and repreue the king For when this king Em^merodach saw this play
And the barons knights and gentillmen of his court play with the philosopher
/ he meruaylled greatly of the beaulte and nouelte of the play / And desired to
play against ye philosopher / The philosopher answered and said to him that hit
might not be done. But if he first learned the play / The king said hit was
reason and that he would put him to the pain to learn hit Than the philosophre
began to teache him and to show him the manner of the table of the chesse board
and the chesse meyne / And also the manners and conditions of a king of the
nobles and of the comun people and of their offices and how they should be
touchid and drawn. And how he should amend him self and become virtuous And
when this king herd that he repreuyd him / He demanded him upon pain of death
to tell him wherefore he had founden and made this play / And he answered my
right dear lord and king / the grettest and most thing that I desire is that
thou have in thy self a glorious and virtuous life And that may I not see / but
if thou be endoctrined and well manerd and that had / so may thou be beloved
of thy people Thus than I desire yt thou have other government than thou have
had / And that thou have upon thy self first seygnorye and maistrye such as
thou have upon other by force and not by right Certainly hit is not right that
a man be master over other and comandour / when he can not rewle ner may rewle
him self and that his virtues domyne above his vices / For seygnourye by force
and will may not long endure / Than thus may thou see oon of the causes why
and wherefore I have founden and maad this play / which Is for to correct and
repent the of thy tyra^nye and vicyous living / For all kings specially
ought to here her corrygeours or correctours and her corrections to hold and
keep in mind / In like wise as Valerius reherceth that the king Alixandre had
a noble and renomed knight that said in repreuynge of Alixandre that he was to
much covetous and in especyall of the honors of the world / And said to him
if the gods had maad thy body as greet as is thy heart All the world could
not hold the / For thou hold in thy right hand all the Oryent / And in thy
lift hand the occident / syn than hit is so / or thou art a god or a man or
naught / if thou be god / do than well and good to the people as god does / And
take not from them that they ought to have and is theyres. if thou be a man /
think that thou shall dye / And than thou shall do noon evil / if thou be
naught forgete thy self / there is no thing so strong and ferme / but that
sometime a feeble thing casts down and overthrow hit How well that the lion
be the strengest best / yet sometime a lityll bird eteth him / The second
cause wherefore this play was founden and maad / was for to keep him from
idleness / whereof senecque says unto lucylle ydlenes with out any ocupacion
is sepulture of a man living / and varro says in his sentences that in like
wise as men goo not for to goo / the same wise the life is not given for to live
but for to do well and good / And therefore secondly the philosopher fond this
play for to keep the people from ydlenes / For there is much people. When so is
that they be fortunat in wordly goods that they draw them to ease and ydlenes
whereof comes often times many euyllys and great sins And by this ydlenes the
heart is quenchid whereof comes desperacion / The third cause is that every
man naturelly desires to know and to here noueltees and tidings / For this
cause they of atthenes studied as we read / and for as the corporal or bodyly
sight enpess^heth and lets otherwhyle the knowleche of subtle things /
therefore we read that democrion the philosopher put out his owen eyes / for as
much as he might have the better entendement and understanding / Many have been made blind that were great clerkis in like wise as was dydymus bishop of
Alixandrye / that how well that he saw not yet he was so great a clerk / that
gregore nazan and saint Jerome that were clerks and maystres to other / came
for to be his scolers and learned of him And saint Anthony The great heremyte
came for to see him on a time / and among all other things / he demanded him
if he were not greatly displesid that he was blind and saw not. And he answered
that he was greatly abasshid / for that he supposid not that he was not
displesid in that he had lost his sight / And saint Anthonye answered to him I
marvel much that hit displesith the that thou have lost that thing which
is common between the and bestes. And thou know well that thou have not lost
that thing that is common bitwene the and the angellis And for thise causes
foresaid the philosopher intended to put away all pensifnes and thoughts / and
to think only on this play as shall be said and appear in this book after.

The second tractate / the first chapter treteth of the form of a king of
his manners and of his estate.
THe king must be thus maad For he must sit in a chayer clothed in purpure /
crowned on his heed in his right hand a ceptre and in the lift hand an apple
of gold / For he is the most grettest and highest in dignyte above all other and
most worthy. And that is signefyed by the corone / For the glory of the people
is the dignite of the king / And above all other the king ought to be
replenysshid with virtues and of grace / and this signefieth the purpure For in
like wise as the robes of purpure makes fair and enbelysshith the body / the
same wise virtues makes the soul / he ought alleway thenke on the government
of the Royame and who has thadmynystracion of Justice / And this should be by
him self pryncipally. This signefieth the app^ell of gold that he holds in
his lift hand / And for as much as hit apperteyneth unto him to punysshe the
rebels has he ye scepter in his right hand And for as much as mysericorde
and truth conserve and keep the king in his trone / Therefore ought a king
to be merciful and debonayr For when a king or prince desired or will be
beloved of his people late him be governed by debonarite And valerius says that
debonairte percyth the hertes of strangers and amolisshith and makes soft
the hertes of his enemies / whereof he reherceth that philostratus that was duc
of athenes had a daughter / whom a man louyd so ardantly / that on a time as he
saw her with her mother / suddenly he came and kyssed her / whereof the mother was
so angry and soroufull that she went and required of her lord the duc / that
his heed might be smyten of / The prince answered to her and said / if we should
slay them that love us / what shall we do to our enemies that hate us /
Certainly this was thanswer of a noble and debonair prince That suffered that
villonye don to his daughter and to him self yet more This prince had also a
friend that was named Arispe that said on a time as much villonye unto the
prince as any man miht say And that might not suffice him / but he scracchid
him in the visage / The prince suffryd him patiently in such wise as thowh he
had done to him no vilonye but curtoysye And when his sons would have auengid
this vilonye / he commanded them that they should not be so hardy so to do The
next day following arispe remembrid of the right great vilonye that he had don
to his friend and lord with out cause. He fill in dispayr and would have slain
him self / when the duc knew and understood that / he came to him and said / ne
doubt the nothing And swore to him by his faith / that also well he was and
should be his friend fro than forthon as every he had been to fore if he would And
thus he respited him of his death by his debonairte. And in like wise read we of
the king pirre to whom was reported that they of tarente had said great
vilonye of him For which cause he maad all them to come to fore him And
demanded of them if they had so said. Than oon of them answered and said / if
the wyn and the candellys had not fayllyd / this langage had been but a Iape /
In regard of that we had thought to have done / Than the king began to lawhe
/ for they had confessid that such langage as was said and spoken was by
dronkenship / And for this cause of debonairte the people of tarante took for a
custom that the dronken men should be punysshyd / And the sobre men preysed.
The king than thus ought to love humylyte and hate fal^^te after the holy
scripture that speaks of every man generally / For the king in his royame
represents god / And god is verite / And therefore him ought to say no thing
but if hit were veritable and stable. Valerius reherceth that Alixandre with
all his ooste rood for to destroy a cite which was named lapsare / when than
a phylosophre which had to name Anaximenes which had been to fore maistre and
governor of Alixandre herd and understood of his coming Came again Alixandre
for to desire and require of him. And when he saw Alixandre he supposid to
have axid his request / Alixander brake his demand to fore and swore to him
to fore he axid any thing by his gods. That such thing as he axid or
requyryd of him / he would in no wise done / Than the philosopher required him
to destroy the cite / when Alixandre understood his desire / and the oath that
he had maad / he suffrid the cite to stand and not to be destroyed For he had
lever do his will than to be perjured and forsworn and do against his oath /
Quyntilian says that no great man ne lord should not swear / but where as is
great need / And that the simple parole or word of a prince ought to be more
stable than the oath of a merchant / Alas how keep the princes their promises
in thise days / not only her promises but their oaths her sealis and wrytynges
and signs of their propre hands / all faylleth god amend hit etc A king
also ought to hate all cruelte / For we read that never yet dyed any pietous
person of evil death ne cruel person of good death Therefore recounteth
valerius that there was a man named theryle a werkeman in metal / that made a
boole of coppre and a lityll wyket on the side / whereby men might put in them
that should be brent therein / And hit was maad in such manner / that they that
should be put and enclosid therein should cry no thing like to the wys of a man
but of an ox And this made he be cause men should have the less pite of them.
When he had made this bole of copper / he presented hit unto a king which was
called philarde that was so cruel a tyrant that he delited in no thing but in
cruelte And he told him the condition of the bole / when philarde herd and
understood this / he allowed and preysed much the work / And after said to
him / thou that art more cruel than I am / thou shall assaye and prove first
thy p^sente and yeft / And so made him to goo in to the boole and dye an evil
death / Therefore says Ouide there is no thing more raisonable than that a man
dye of such death as he purchases unto other Also the king ought souerainly
keep Justice / who makes or keeps a royame with out Justice / of verray
force there must be great robberye and theft Therefore reherceth saint Augustyn
in a book which is entitled the cite of god / that there was a thief of the sea
named diomedes that was a great rouar and did so much harm that the
complaints came to fore Alixander which did him to be taken and brought to
fore him / and he demanded him wherefore he was so noyous and cruel in the sea
And he answered to him again / for as much as thou art ^on a land in the world
/ so am I another in ye see but for as much as the evil yt I do is in oon
galeye or tweyne therefore I am called a thief / but for as much as thou d^st
in many shippis and with great puyssance and power therefore art thou called an
emperor / but if fortune were for me in such wise / I would be come a good man
and better than I now am / but thou / the more richer and fortunat that thou
art / the more worse art thou / Alixander said to him I shall change thy
fortune in such wise as thou ne say / that thou shall do hit by pouerte /
but for evil and mauaiste / And so he made him rich / And this was he that
afterward was a good prince and a good Iusticyer / The king ought to be
soueraynly chaste / And this signefyeth a queen that is only on his right side
For hit is to be believed and credible that when the king is a good man Just.
true and of good manners and conditions / that his children shall follow gladly
the same / for a good sone and a true ought not to forsake and goo fro ye good
conditions of his fader. For certes hit is against god and nature in party
when a man takes other than his propre wife / And that see we by birds / of
whom the male and female have to gyder the charge in keeping and norisshinge of
their young fowlis and birdis / For some manner of fowlis kepen them to their
femeles only / As hit appears by storkes dowues and turtils / But tho fowls
that norisshith not their birds have many wives and femelles / As the cock
that no thing norisshith his chekens / And therefore among all the bestes
that been / Man and woman puts most their ^^^ente and have most cure and
charge in norisshyng of their children / And therefore done they against nature
in party when they leave their wives for other women / Of this chastete
reherceth valerius an example and says that there was a man of rome which was
named scipio affrican For as much as he had conquered affricque how well that
he was of rome born. When he was of.xxxiiii. yer of age he conquered cartage And
took much people in Ostage / Among whom he was presented with a right fair
maid for his solas and playsir which was assurid and handfast unto a noble
young gentillman of cartage which was named Indimcible / And anon as this
gentill scipio knew that Notwythstandyng that he was a prince noble and lusty
Did do call anon the parents and kynnesmen of them And deliuerid to them
their daughter with out doing of any vilonye to her / and ye raenso^ or gold
that they had ordained for their daughter / gaf hi^ every dele In do waire to
her And the young man that was her husbonde saw the fraunchis^ and gentilnes of
him / turned him self and the hertes of the noble people unto the love and
alliance of the romans / And this suffiseth as towchynge the king etc.

The second chapit^^ of the second book treteth of the form and manners of
the Queen.
THus ought the Queen be maad / she ought to be a fair lady sittynge in a
chayer and crowned with a corone on her heed and cladd with a cloth of gold and
a mantyll above furrid with ermynes And she should sytte on the lift side of
the king for the amplections and enbrasynge of her husbonde / like as it is
said in scripture in the canticles / her lift arm shall be under my heed And
her right arm shall be clyppe and enbrace me / In that she is set on his
lift side is by grace given to the king by nature and of right. For better is
to have a king by succession than by eleccion / For oftentimes the electours
and chosers can not ne will not accord / And so is the election left / And
otherwhyle they chese not the best and most able and conuenyent / but him that
they best love / or is for them most proffytable / But when the king is by
lignage and by true succession / he is taught enseygned and nourisshid in his
yongth in all good and virtuous tacches and manners of his fader / And also the
princes of the royame dar not so hardily meue war against a king having a
sone for to regne after him And so a Queen ought to be chaste. wise. of honest
people / well manerd and not curyous in nourisshynge of her children / her
wysedom ought not only tappere in feet and works but also in speaking that is
to wete that she be secret and tell not such things as ought to be holden
secret / Wherefore it is a common proverb (...) that women can keep no
counceyle And acordyng thereto Macrobe reherceth in the book of the dremes of
scipio. That there was a child of rome that was named papirus that on a time
went with his fader which was a senator in to the chamber where as they held
their counceyll And that time they spak of such matters as was commanded and
agreed should be kept secret upon pain of their heedes And so departed And when
he was comen home from the senatoire and fro the counceyll with his fader / his
mother demanded of him what was the counceyll and whereof they spack and had
tarried so long there And the child answered to her and said he durst not tell
ner say hit for so much as hit was defended upon pain of death Than was the
mother more desirous to know than she was to fore / And began to flatere him
one time And afterward to menace him that he should say and tell to her what
hit was And when the child saw that he might have no rest of his mother in no
wise He made her first promise that she should keep hit secret And to tell hit
to none of the world / And that done he feigned a lesing or a lie and said to
her / that the senators had in counceyll a great question and difference
which was this / whether hit were better and more for the common well of rome /
that a man should have two wyuys / or a wife to have two husbondes / And when she
had understand this / he defended her that she should tell hit to none other
body And after this she went to her gossyb and told to her this counceyll
secretly / And she told to an other / And thus every wife told hit to other in
secret And thus hit happend anon after that all the wives of rome came to the
senatorye where the senators were assemblid / And cried with an hye wys / that
they had lever / and also hit were better for the common well that a wife should
have two husbondes than a man two wives / The senators heerynge this. were
greatly abasshid and wist not what to say / ner how to answer / till at last
that the child papire reherced to them all the caas and feet how hit was
happend And when the senators herd and understood the matter they were greatly
abasshid / and commended greatly ye Iugenye and wit of the child that so wisely
contrived the lie rather than he would discouere their cou^ceyll / And
forthwith made him a senator / and establisshid and ordained fro than forthon
that no child in any wise sholl enter in to ye counceyll house among them with
their faders exept papirus / whom they would yt he should al^wey be among them /
also a queen ought to be chaste / for as she is above all other in astate and
reuer^ce so should she be ensample to all other in her living honestly / whereof
Jerome reherceth against Io^ynyan / that there was a gentilman of rome named
duele / and this man was he yt first fond ye manner to fight on ye water / and
had first victory / this duele had to his wif one of the best women and so
chaste / that every woman might take ensample of her / And at yt time the sin
of the flesh was the grettest sin yt any might do against nature / And
this said good woman was named ylye / and so hit happend that this duele becam
so old that he stowped and quaqued for age And on a tym^ one of his
adversaries repreuyd and reprochid him sayng that he had a stynkynge breath /
And forthwyth he went home to his wife all angry and abasshid and axid her why
and wherefore she had not told his defaulte to him that he might have founden
remedy to have been purgid thereof / And she answered that as for as much as she
supposid that every man had that same fault as well as he For she kyst never
any man's mouth but her husbondes / O much was this woman to be preysed and
have a singular lawde wenynge that this defaulte had not ben only in her
husbonde / wherefore she suffrid hit patiently in such wise that her husbonde
knew his defaute sonner by other than by her / Also we read that there was a
wedowe named anna / which had a friend that counceyllid her to marye / For she
was young fair and rich / to whom she answered that she would not so do in no
wise For if I should have an husbond as I have had and that he were as good as
he was / I should ever ben a ferd to lose him / like as I lost that other / And
than should I live allwey in fere and dread / which I will not And if hit
happend me to have a wors / what should hit prouffite me to have an evil
husbond after a good. And so she concluded that she would keep her chastete.
Saint Austyn reherceth in the book de Ciuitate dei that in rome was a noble
lady gentill of manners and of high kynrede named lucrecia / And had an
husbonde named colatyne / which desired on a time the Emperors sone named
Torquyne thorguyllous or the proud and he was callid sixte for to come dyne
and sport him in his castle or manoir And when he was entrid among many
noble ladies he saw lucrecia / And when this Emperors sone had seen and
advertised her deportes. her contenance. her manner. and her beaulte / he was
all rauysshid and esprised with her love forthwyth And espied a time when her
husbonde collatyn went unto the ooste of the emperor / and came in to the place
where as lucresse was with her felawship / whom she receyuyd honorably / and
when time came to goo to bed and sleep she made ready a bed ryally for him
as hit apperteyned to the emperors sone And this sixtus espied where lucresia
lay. And when he supposyd and knew that every body was in his first sleep /
he came to the bed of lucresse and that oon hand set on her breast and in
that other hand a naked swerd / and said to her / lucresse hold thy pees and
cry not / For I am sixte tarquynus sone / for if you speak any word thou shall
be deed / And for fere she held her pees / Than he began to pray and promise
many things And after he menaced and thretenyd her that she should enclyne to
him to do his will / And when he saw he could ner might have his intent he
said to her if thou do not my will / I shall slay the and oo^n of thy servants
and shall leye him all ded by thy side And than I shall say that I have slain
you for your rybawdrye / And lucresse that than doubted more the shame of the
world than the death consentid to him / And anon after as the Emperors sone
was departid / the lady sent lres to her husbond her fader her brethern and
to her friends / and to a man callid brute conceyllour and neuewe to tarquyn /
And said to them / that yesterday sixte the emperors sone came in to mine house
as an enemy in likeness of a friend / and has oppressid me And know you
colatyn that he has dishonorid thy bed And how well yt he has fowled and
dishonored my body / yet mine heart is not / wherefore I beseech the of pardon
foryfnes and absolucion of the trespass but not of the pain / and he yt has
done this sin to me hit shall ben to his meschance if ye do your deuoir /
And be cause no woman take ensample of lucresse and live after the trespaas /
but that she in likewise take ensample also of the pain And forthwyth with a
swerd that she held under her gowen or robe / she roof her self unto the heart
And deyde forthwyth to fore them / And than brute the counseillr And her
husbond collatyn and all her other friends swore by the blood of lucresse that
they would never rest unto the time that they had put out of rome tarquyn and
all his lignee / And that never after none of them should come to dignite / And
all this was done. For they bare the deed corpse through the cite and meuyd the
people in such wise / that tarquyn was put in exyle And sixte his sone was
slain / A Queen ought to be well manerd and among all she ought to be
tumerous and shamefast / For when a woman has lost shamefastnes / she may ner
can not well be chaast / Wherefore says symachus that they that been not
shamefast have no conscience of luxurye / And saint Ambrose says that oon of
the best parements and makes a woman most fair in her person / is to be
shamefast / Senecque reherceth that there was oon named Archezille which was so
shamefast That she put in a pelow of feathers a certain some of money / and put
hit under ye heed of a pour friend of heeris / which dissimyled his pouerte
and would not. ner durst not be a known of his pouerte For for shame she durst
not give hit openly / but had lever that he should find hit / than that she had
given hit him / wherefore otherwhile men should give and help her friends so
secretly That they know not whens hit come / For when we keep hit secret and
make no boost thereof / our deeds and works shall plese god and them also / A
Queen ought to be chosen when she shall be wedded of the most honest kynrede
and people / For oftentimes the daughters folowen the tacches and manners of them
that they ben descended from / whereof Valerius maximus says that there was one
that would marye / which came to a philosopher and axid counceyll what wif he
might best take He answered that he should take her that thou know certainly
that her mother and her grauntdame have been chaast and well condicioned / For
such mother / such daughter comunely / Also a queen ought to teache her
childern to ben contynent and keep chastity entyerly / as hit is wreton in
ecclesiastes / if thou have sons enseigne and teache them / And if thou have
daughters keep well them in chastity / For helemonde reherceth that every king
and prince ought to be a clerk for to comande to other to study and read the
law of our lord god / And therefore wrote the emperor to the king of france
that he should do learn his children sons the seven sciences* lyberall / And
said among other things that a king not lettryd resembles an ass^ coroned
/ The Emperor Octauian maad his sons to be taught and learn to swyme. to
spring and lepe. to Just. to play with the axe and sword / And all manner
thing that apperteyneth to a knight / And his daughters he made hem to learn.
to sewe. to spynne. to labor as well in wolle as in lynnen cloth / And all
other werkis langynge to women And when his friends demanded wherefore he did
so / he answered how well that he was lord and sire of all the world / yet
wyste he not what should befalle of his children and whether they should fall or
come to pouerte or no / and therefore if they conne a good craft they may^
alleway live honestly / The Queen ought to keep her daughters in all chastyte
/ For we read of many maidens that for their virginite have been made queen's /
For poule the historiagraph of the lombardes reherceth yt there was a duchess
named remonde which had.iii. sons and two daughters And hit happend that the
king of hongrye cantanus assaylled a castle where she and her children were
I^^e And on a day she beheld her enemies And among all other she saw the
king that he was a well faryng and goodly man / Anon she was esprised and
taken with his love / And that so sore / that forthwith she sent to him that
she would deliuere over the castle to him if he would take her to his wife and
wedde her And he agreed thereto / and swear that he would have her to his wife on
that condition / when than the king was in the castle / his people took men
and women and all that they fond / her sons fled from her / of whom one
was named Ermoaldus and was youngest / and after was du^ of boneuentan / And syn
king of the lumbardis. And the two susters took chikens And put hem under her
arms next the flessh and between her pappes / that of the heete and chaffyng
the flessh of the chikens stanke. And when so was that they of hongrye would
have enforcid and defowled hem anon they felt the stenche and fled away and
so left hem sayng / fie how these lombardes stynke / and so they kept their
virginite / wherefore that one of them afterward was Queen of france And that
other Queen of Aleman / And hit happend than that the king Catanus took
acordynge to his promise the duchess / and lay with her one night for to save
his oath And on the morn he made her comune unto all the hongres / And the
third day after he did do put a staf of tree fro the nether part of her /
through her body unto her throat or mouth / for be cause of the lust of her
flessh she betrayed her cite and said such husbond / such wife etc And this
suffices of the Queen.

The third chapitre of the second tractate treteth of the alphyns her offices
and manners.
THe Alphyns ought to be made and formed in manner of Iuges sitting in a
chayer with a book open to fore their eyes / And that is be cause that some
causes ben crymynell / And some ben cyuyle as about possessions and other
temporell things and trespaces / And therefore ought to be two Iuges in the
royame / one in the black for the first cause / And that other in white as for
the second / Their office is for to counceyll the king / And to make by his
comandements good laws And to inform all the royame in good and virtuous
manners / And to Judge and give sentence well and truly after the caas is had /
And to counceyll well and Justly all them that axe counceyll of hem / with
out having of any eye opene to any person / And to estudye diligently in
such wise and to ordeygne all that / that ought to be kept be obseruyd be
fast and stable / So that they be not found corrupt for yeft for favor ne
for lignage ne for envy variable And as touching the first point Seneque
says in the book of benefetes that the pour Dyogenes was more strong than
Alixandre / For Alixandre could not give so much as Diogenes would reffuse.

Marcus cur^us a romayn of great renome says thus. That when he had besiegid
and assayllyd them of samente And boneuentans which herd that he was pour /
they took a great mass and wegghe of gold and sended hit to him prayng him
that he would resseyue hit and leave his assault and siege / And when they came
with the present to him they fond him sittynge on the earth and ete his mete
out of platers and disshes of tree and of wode and did than her message / to
whom he answered and said that they should goo hoome and say to them that sent
hem that marcus cursus loves better to be lord and win richesses than
richesse should win him / For by bataylle he shall not be overcome and
vaynquysshid Nor be gold ne silver he shall not be corrupt ne corompid Often
times that thing takes an evil end that is untrue for gold and silver /
And that a man is subgett unto money may not be lord thereof / helimond
reherceth that demonscene demanded of aristodone how much he had won for
pletynge of a cause for his clyent / And he answered a marck of gold /
Demoscenes answered to him again that he had won as much for to hold his pees
and speak not Thus the tongues of advocates and men of law ben peryllous and
domegeable / yet they must be had if thou wylt win thy cause for with money
and yeft thou shall win And oftetymes they selle as well their scilence / as
their utterance / Valerius reherceth that the senators of rome took counceyll
to geder of two persons that one was pour / And that other rich and covetous
/ which of hem both were most apt for to send to govern and Judge the
contre of spain / and scipion of affricque said that none of them both were
good ner profitable to be sent theder / For that one has no thing And to
that other may nothing suffice And despised in his saying all pouerte and
auerice in a Judge / For a covetous man has need of an halfpeny For he is
servant and bond unto money / and not lord thereof. But pouerte of heart and of
will ought to be greatly allowed in a Judge Therefore we read that as long as the
romans louyd pouerte they were lords of all the world For many there were that
exposed all their goods for the common well and for that was most profitable
for the comynaulte that they were so pour that when they were deed they were
buried and brought to earth with the common good / And their daughters were
married by the ^^mandement of the senators / But syn that they despised pouert^
/ And begone to gadre rychesses / And ^^ue maad great bataylles / they have
used many sins And so the common well perysshid / For there is no sin but
that it regneth there / There is none that is so ^ynfull as he that has all
the world in despyte / For he is in pees that dredeth no man / And he is rich
that coueyteth no thing / Valere reherceth that he is not rich that much
has / But he is rich that has little and coueyteth no thing / Than thus
late the Iuges take heed that they enclyne not for love or for hate in any
Judgment / For theophrast says that all love is blind there love is / there
can not right Judgment by given / For all love is blind And therefore love is
none even Judge For often times love Iugeth a fowll and lothly woman to be fair
And so reherceth quynte curse in his first book that the great Godaches says
the same to Alixandre men may say in this caas that nature is evil For every
man is less auysed and worse in is own feet and cause than in an other man's /
And therefore the Iuges ought to keep hem well from ire in Judgment / Tullius
says that an angry and yrous person weneth that for to do evil / is good
counceyll / and socrates says yt.ii. things ben contraryous to cou^ceyll /
and they ben hastynes and wrath / and Galeren says in Alexandrye / if ire or
wrath overcome the when thou sholdest give Judgment / weye all thing in ye
balance so that thy Judgment be not enclyned by love ne by yefte / ne favor of
person torn not thy courage. Helemond reherceth that Cambyses king of perse
which was a rightwys king had an vnrightwys Judge / which for envy and evil
will had dampened a man wrongfully and against right / wherefore he did him to
be flain all quyk / and made the chayer or siege of Judgment to be couerid with
his skyn / And made his sone Judge and to sit in the chayer on the skyn of his
fader / to the end that the sone should Judge rightwysly / And abhor the
Judgment and pain of his fader / Iuges ought to punysshe the defaultes egally
And fullfille the law that they ordeyne / Caton says accomplisshe and do the
law in such wise as thou have ordained and given. Valerius reherceth that
calengius a consul had a sone which was taken in adwultrye. And therefore
after the law at that time he was dampened to lose both his eyes The fader
would yt the law should be acco^plisshid in his sone with out favor / but all
the cite was meuyd herewyth And would not suffer hit / but in the end his fader
was vaynquysshid by their prayers / And ordained that his sone should lose oon
eye which was put out And he him self lost an other eye / And thus was the
law observed and kept / And the prayer of the people was accomplisshid We ^ede
yt there was a counceyllour of rome that had given counceill to make a statute /
that who some ever that entrid in to the senatoire / and a swerd gyrt about
him should be ded / Than hit happend on a time that he came from with out and
entrid in to the senatoyre and his swerd gyrt about him / whereof he took no^n
heed / and o^n of the senators told him of hit / and when he knew hit and
remembrid the statute / he drew out his swerd and slew him self to fore them
/ rather to dye than to break the law / for whose death all the senators made
great sorrow / but alas we find not many in thise days that so do / but
they do like as anastasius says that the laws of some ben like unto the
nettis of spyncoppis that take no great bestes and fowls but let goo and flee
through. But they take flies and gnattes and such small things / In like wise
the laws now a days ben not executed but upon the pour people / the great and
rich break hit and goo through with all And for this cause sourden bataylles
and discordes / and make ye great and rich men to take by force and strength
lordshippis and seignouries upon the small and pour people / And this done they
specially that been gentill of lignage and pour of goods And causes them to
rob and reave And yet constrained them by force to serve them And this is no
meruayll / for they that dread not to anger god / ner to break the law and to
false hit / Fall often times by force in much cursednes and wikkidnes / but
when ye great people do acordinge to ye law / and punysh the tra^sgressours
sharply The common people abstain and withdraw hem fro dooyng of evil / and
chastises hem self by their example / And the Iuges ought to entende for to
study / for yt if smythes the carpe^tiers yt vignours and other craftsmen say
that it is most necessary to study for the common prouffit And gloryfye them
in their connyng and say that they ben profitable Than should the Iuges
study and contemplaire much more than they in that / that should be for the
common well / wherefore says seneke believe me that they seem that they do no
thing they do more than they that labor For they do spirytuell and also
corporal werkis / and therefore among Artificers there is no pleasant rest /
But that reason of the Iuges has maad and ordained hit / And therefore angelius
in libro actiui atticatorum de socrate says That socrates was on a time so
pensyf that in an hole naturell day / He held one estate that he ne meuyd
mouth ne eye ne foot ne hand but was as he had been ded rauysshyd. And when one
demanded him wherefore he was so pensyf / he answered in all worldly things and
labors of the same And held him bourgoys and cytezeyn of the world And
valerius reherceth that carnardes a knight was so sage wise and laborous in
pensifnes of the common well / that when he was set at table for to ete / he
forgate to put his hand unto the mete to feed him self. And therefore his wife
yt was named mellyse whom he had taken more to have her company and felawship
than for any other thing / Fed him to the end that he should not dye for
honger in his pensifnes / Dydymus said to Alixandrie we ben not deynseyns in
the world but strangers / ner we ben not born in the world for to dwell and
abide allway therein / but for to goo and pass through hit / we have done noon
evil deed / but that it is worthy to be punysshid and we to suffer pain
therefore And than we may goon with opon face and good conscience And so may we
goo lightly and appertly the way that we hope and purpose to goo This
suffiseth as for the Alphyns.

The fourth chapitre of the second book treteth of the order of cheualerye and
knyghthode and of her offices and manners.
THe knight ought to be made all armed upon an horse in such wise that he have
an helm on his heed and a spear in his right hand / and coueryd with his
sheld / a sword and a mace on his lift side / Cladd with an hawberk and plates
to fore his brest^ / leg harnoys on his legs / Spores on his heelis on his
hands his gauntelettes / his horse well broken and taught and apt to bataylle
and couerid with his arms / when the knights ben maad they ben bayned or
bathed / that is the sign that they should led a new life and new manners /
also they wake all the night in prayers and orysons unto god that he will
give hem grace that they may get that thing that they may not get by nature
/ The king or prince gyrdeth a boute them a sword in sign / that they should
abide and keep him of whom they take their dispenses and dignyte. Also a knight
ought to be wise. liberal. true. strong and full of mercy and pite and kepar
of the people and of the law / And right as cheualrye passes other in virtue in
dignite in honor and in reverence / right so ought he to surmounte all other
in virtue / For honor is no thing ellis but to do reverence to an other person
for ye good and virtuous disposicion yt is in him / A noble knight ought to be
wise and preuyd to fore he be made knight / hit behooved him that he had long
time vsid the war and arms / that he may be expert and wise for to govern
the other For syn that a knight is capitayn of a battle The life of them that
shall be under him lies in his hand And therefore behooves him to be wise and
well aduysed / for some time (...) and engyue is more worth than strength or
hardynes of a man that is not proved in Arms / For otherwhyle hit happeth that
when the prince of the battle affieth and trusts in his hardynes and
strength And wole not use wysedom and engyne for to run upon his enemies / he
is vaynquysshid and his people slain / Therefore says the philosopher that no
man should chese young people to be captayns and governors For as much as there
is no certainte in her wysedom. Alexandre of macedone vaynquysshid and
conquerid Egypt Jude Caldee Affricque / and Assirye unto the marches of
bragmans more by the counceyll of old men than by the strength of the young men
/ we read in the historye of rome yt there was a knight which had to name
malechete that was so wise and true that when the Emperor Theodosius was deed
/ he made mortal war against his brother germain which was named Gildo or
Guye For as much as this said guye would be lord of affricque with out leave
and will of the senators. And this said guye had slain the two sons of his
brother malechete / And did much torment unto the christian people And before that
he should come in to the field against his brother Emyon / he went in to an isle
of capayre And ladde with him all the christian men that had been sent theder in
Exyle And made hem all to pray with him by the space of three days and three
nyghtis / For he had great trust in the prayers of good folk / and specially
that noman might counceyll ne help but god / and.iii. days to fore he should
fight say^ ^ Ambrose which was ded a lityl^ to fore apperid to him / and
shewde him by reuelacion the time and our that he should have victory / and for
as much as he had been.iii. days and.iii. nyghtes in his prayers and that he
was assewrid for to have victory / He faught with.v. thousand men against his
brother yt had in his company.xxiiii. thousand men And by gods help he had
victory And when the barbaryns yt were comen to help guion saw ye
disconfiture they fled away / and guion fledd also in to affricque by shipp /
and when he was there arrived he was sone after stranglid / These.ii. knights
of whom I speak were two birdern germayns / which were sent to affricque for
to defend the common we will / In likewise Judas machabeus Ionathas and simon his
bredern put hem self in the mercy and guard of our lord god And again the
enemies of the law of god with lityll people in regard of the multitude that
were again them / and had also victory / The knights ought to ben true to
their princes / for he that is not true leseth ye name of a knight Unto a
prince troth is the grettest precious stone when it is medlid with Justice /
Paul the historiagraph of the lombardes reherceth that there was a knight named
enulphus and was of the cite of papye that was so true to his king named
patharich / that he put him in parill of death for him / For hit happend that
Grymald Duc of buuentayns of whom we have touched to fore in the chapitre of
the Queen / Did do she Godebert which was king of the lombardes by the
hand of Goribert duc of Tauryn / which was descended of the crown of
lombardis And this grimald was maad* king of lombardis in his place / and
after this put and bannysshid out of the country this patharych which was
brother unto the king Godebert / that for fere and dread fledd in to hongrye /
And than this knight Enulphus did so much that he gate the peace again of his
lord patharich against the king grymalde / and that he had license to come out
of hongrye where he was allwey in paryll. and so he came and cried him mercy And
the king grymalde gaf him leave to dwell and to live honestly in his contree /
allway forseen that he took not upon him and named him self king how well he
was king by right This done a litill while after / the king that believed
evil tongues / thought in him self how he might bring this patharich unto the
death And all this knew well the knight enulphus / which came the same night
with his squire for to visit his lord And made his squire to unclothe him and
to lie in the bed of his lord And made his lord to rise and clothe him with
the clothis of his squire / And in this wise brought him out / brawling and
betynge him as his servant by them that were assigned to keep the hows of
patharik yt he should not escape Which supposid that hit had been his squire
that he entretid so outragiously / and so he brought him to his house which
Joined with the walls of the town / And at mydnyght when all men were a
sleep / he let a down his maistre by a cord / which took an horse out of
the pasture And fled unto the cite of Aast and there came to the king of france
/ And when hit came unto the morn. Hit was founden that Arnolphus and his squire
had dereyuyd the king and the wacchemen / whom the king commanded should be
brought to fore him And demanded of them the manner how he was escaped And they
told him the truth / Than the king demanded his counceyll of what death they
had deseruyd to dye that had so done and wrought again the will of him / Some
said that they should ben honged / and some said they should ben flayn And other
said that they should be beheedid. Than said the king by that lord that made me
/ they ben not worthy to dye / but for to have much worship and honor / For
they have been true to their lord / wherefore (...) king gaf hem a great lawde
and honor for their seet And after hit happend that the propre squire and
servant of godeberd slew the traytre Goribalde that by (...) had slain his
lord at a feste of saint John in his (...) of Tauryn whereof he was lord and duc
/ Thus ought the knights to love to gyder / And each to put his life in
adventure for other / For so ben they the strenger And the more doubted / Like
as were the noble knights Ioab and Abysay that fought against the syryens and
Amonytes / And were so true that oon to that other that they vaynquysshid
their enemies And were so Joined to gyder that if the siryens were strenger
than that one of them / that other help him / we read that damon and phisias
were so right parfyt friends to gyder that when Dionisius which was king of
cecylle had Iuged one to death for his trespaas in the cite of syracusane whom
he would have executed / he desired grace and leave to goo in to his contre for
to dispose and ordonne his testament / And his felawe pleggid him and was
sewrte for him upon his heed that he should come again.

Whereof they that saw and herd this / held him for a fool^ and blamed him /
And he said allway that he repentid him nothing at all / For he knew well the
troth of his felawe And when the day came and the our that execusion should be
done / his felawe came and presented him self to fore the Judge / And dischargid
his felawe that was plegge for him / whereof the king was greatly abasshid And
for the great truth that was founden in him He pardonyd him and prayed hem
both that they would resseyue him as their great friend and felawe / Lo here
the virtues of love that a man ought naught to doubt the death for his friend /
Lo what it is to do for a friend / And to lead a life debonayr And to be with
out cruelte / to love and not to hate / which causes to do good against evil
And to torn pain in to benefete and to quench cruelte Anthonyus says that
Julius Caesar / left not lightly frenshippe and Amytye / But when he had hit he
retained hit fast and mayteyned hit alleway / Scipion of Affricque says that
there is no thing so strong / as for to mayntene love unto the death The love
of concupiscence and of lecherye is sone dissoluyd and broken / But the verray
true love of the common well and prouffit now a days is selde founden / where
shall thou find a man in these days that will expose him self for the
worship and honor of his friend / or for the common well / selde or never
shall he be founden / Also the knights should be large and liberal For when a
knight has regard unto his singular prouffit by his couetyse / he dispoylleth
his people For when the souldyours see that they put hem in paryll. And their
master will not pay hem their wages liberally / but entendeth to his own
propre gayn and prouffyt / than when the Enemies come they torn sone her
backs and flee oftentimes / And thus hit happeth by him that entendeth more to
get money than victory that his auaryce is often times cause of his confusion
Than late every knight take heed to be liberal in such wise that he wene not
ne suppose that his scarcete be to him a great winning or gayn / And for this
cause he be the less louyd of his people / And that his aduersarye wythdrawe to
him them by large gyuynge / For often time bataylle is auaunced more for getynge
of silver. Than by the force and strength of men / For men see all^ day that
such things as may not be achieuyd by force of nature / ben gotten and
achieuyd by force of money / And for so much hit behooves to see well (...)
that when the time of the bataylle comes / that he borowe not ne make no
t^yllage / For noman may be rich that leuyth his own / hopyng to get and
take of other / Than allwaye all her gayn and winning ought to be common among
them exept their Arms. For in like wise as the victory is comune / so should
the dispoyll and lotye be comune unto them And therefore David that gentle
knight in the first book of kings in the last chapitre made a law / that he
that abode behind by maladye or sekenes in the tents should have as much
part of the butyn as he that had be in the bataylle / And for the love of this
law he was made afterward king of Israel / Alexander of Macedone came on a
time like a simple knight unto the court of Porus king of Jude for to espy
thestate of the king and of the knights of the court / And the king
resseyuyd him right worshipfully / And demanded of him many things of
Alexander and of his constance and strength / nothing wenynge that he had been
Alexander But antygone one of his knyghtis and after he had him to dinner And
when they had served Alexander in vayssell of gold and silver with dyuerce
metes etc After that he had eten such as plesid him he wyded the mete and took
the vayssell and held hit to him self and put hit in his bosom or sleuys /
whereof he was accusid unto the king After dinner than the king callid him and
demanded him wherefore he had taken his vayssell And he answered / Sire king my
lord I pray the to understand and take heed thy self and also thy knights /
I have herd much of thy great hyenes And yt thou art more mighty and puyssant
in cheualrye and in dispensis than is Alexander / and therefore I am come to the
a pour knight which am named Antygone for to serve the / Than hit is the
custom in the Court of Alexandre / that what thing a knight is served with
all is all his / mete and vayssell and cup And therefore I had supposid that
this custom had been kept in thy court for thou art richer than he / when the
knights herd this / ano^n they left porus / and went for to serve alixandre
/ and thus he drew to him ye hertes of them by yeftes / which afterward slew
Porus that was king of Jude / And they made Alexandre king thereof Therefore
remember knight alleway that with a closid and shette purse shall thou never
have victory. Ouyde says that he that takes yeftes / he is glad therwyth /
For they win with yeftes the hertes of the gods and of men For if Jupiter
were angrid / with yeftes he would be plesid / The knights ought to be strong
not only of body but also in courage. There ben many strong and great of body /
that been faint and feeble in the heart / he is strong that may not be
vaynquysshid and ouercomen / how well that he suffryth much otherwhile / And
so we believe that they that be not over great ne over lityll ben most corageous
and best in battle. We read that cadrus duc of athenes should have a battle
again them of polipe / And he was warned and had a reuelacion of the gods /
that they should have the victory of whom the prince should be slain in the
battle / And the pr^nce which was of a great courage and true heart ^oke
other arms of a pour man / And put him self in the front of the battle to
the end that he might be slain And so he was / for the right true prince had
lever dye Than his people should be ouercomen / And so they had the victory /
Certes hit was a noble and fair thing to expose him self to the death for to
deffende his country. But no man would do so / but if he hopyd to have a better
thing therefore / Therefore the law says that they live in her sowles
gloriously that been slain in the war for the common well / A knight ought also
to be merciful and pyetous For there is nothing yt makes a knight so renomed
as is when he sauyth the life of them that he may slay / For to shede and spylle
blood is the condition of a wild best and not the condition of a good knight
Therefore we read that scylla that was Duc of the Romans with out had many
fair victoyres against the Romans with June that were contrayre to him / In so
much that in the battle of puylle he slew.xviii. thousand men / And in
champanye.lxx. thousand. And after in the cite he slew three thousand men
unarmed And when one of his knights that was named Quyntus catulus saw this
cruelte said to him / Sesse now and suffer them to live and be merciful to
them with whom we have been victorious And with whom we ought to live / For hit
is the most hyeft and fair vengeance that a man may do / as to spare them and
give hem her life whom he may slay Therefore Ioab ordained when absalon was
slain / he sowned a trompette / that his people should no more run and slay
their adversaries. For there were slain about.xx. thousand of them / and in
like wise did he when he faught against Abner And Abner was vaynquysshid and
fled For where that he went in the chaas he commanded to spare the people The
knights ought to keep the people / For when the people ben in their tents or
castellis / the knights ought to keep the wacche / For this cause the romans
called them legyons And they were made of dyuerce prouynces and of dyuerce
nacyons to thentente to keep the people / And the people should entende to their
work / For no crafty man may both entende to his craft and to fight how may
a crafty man entende to his work sewrely in time of war but if he be kept
And right in such wise as the knights should keep ye people in time of peace in
like wise the people ought to pourveye for their dispensis / how should a plowman
be sewre in the field / but if the knights made daily wacche to keep hem For
like as the glory of a king is upon his knyghtis / so hit is necessary to
the knights that the marchantis craftymen and common people be defended and
kept / therefore late the knights keep the people in such wise that they may
enjoy pees and get and gadre the cos^is and expensis of them both / we read
that Athis said to david which was a knight / I make the my kepar and defendar
alleway. Thus should the knights have great zele that the law be kept / For
the mageste ryall ought not only to be garnysshid with arms but also with good
laws / And therefore should they labor that they should be well kept Turgeus
pompeyus reherceth of a noble knight named Ligurgyus that had made ancient
laws the which the people would not keep ne observe / For they seemed hard for
them to keep And would constrayne him to rapele and set hem a part when the
noble knight saw that He did the people to understand that he had not made
them but a god that was named Apollo delphynus had made them / And had commanded
him that he should do the people keep them / Thise words auayled not / they would
in no wise keep them / And than he said to them that hit were good that er the
said laws should be broken that he had given to them. that he should goo and
speak with the god Appollo / For to get of him a dispensacion to break hem /
And that the people should keep and observe them till that he returned again /
The people acorded thereto and swore that they should keep them to the time he
returned Than the knight went in to greece in exyle and dwellid there all his
life / And when he should dye he commanded that his body should be cast in the sea
/ For as much as if his body should be born theder / the people should wene to be
quyt of their oath / And should keep no longer his laws that were so good and
reasonable / and so the knight had lever to forsake his own contre and to dye
so than to repele his laws And his laws were such / The first law was that
ye people should obey and serve the princes / And the princes should keep the
people and do Justice on the malefactors The second law that they should be all
sobre / For he wiste well that the labor of cheualrye is most strong when
they live sobrely / The third was ye noman should bye any thing for money but
they should change ware for ware and one marchandyse for an other / The fourth
was that men should set no more by money ner keep hit more than they would donge
or fylthe / The fyfthe he ordained for the common well all thing by order /
that the princes might meue and make bataylle by her power. to the maistres
counceillours he comysid the Iugementis. And the Annuell rentes / to the
senators the keeping of the law / And to the common people he gaf power to
chese such Iuges as they would have / The sixte he ordained that all thing
should be departid egally and all thing should be common And none richer than
other in patrymonye / The seventh that every man should ete like well in comen
openly / that riches should not be cause of luxurye when they ete secretly / The
eygthe that the young people should not have but o^n gown or garment in the year
/ The nynth that men should set pour children to labor in the field / to
the end that they should not enploye their yongthe in plays and in folly / but
in labor / The tenthe that the maidens should be married without dowayre / In
such wise that no man should take a wife for money / The xi. that men should
rather take a wife for her good manners and virtues than for her richesses / The
twelfthe that men should worship the old and ancient men for their age and
more for their wysedom than for her riches this knight made none of these laws
/ but he first kept hem.

The fyfthe chapitre of the second book of the form and manners of the rooks.
THe rooks which ben vicaires and legates of the king ought to be made like a
knight upon an horse and a mantell and hood furryd with meneuyer holding a staf
in his hand / and for as much as a king may not be in all places of his
royame / Therefore the auctorite of him is given to the rooks / which represent
the king / And for as much as a royame is great and large / and that
rebellion or nouelletes might sourdre and arise in oon party or other /
therefore there ben two rooks one on the right side and that other on the lift
side They ought to have in hem. pity. Justice. humylite. wilful pouerte and
liberalite / First Justice for hit is most fair of the virtues / For hit
happeth oftetyme that the ministris by their pride and orgueyll subuerte
Justice and do no right / Wherefore the kings otherwhile lose their royames
with out their culpe or gylte / For an untrue Judge or of^^cyer makes his lord
to be named un Just and evil* And contrary wise a true mynestre of the law
and ryghtwys / causes the king to be reputed Just and true / The Romans
therefore made good laws / And would that / that they should be Just and true
/ And they that establisshid them for to govern the people would in no wise
break them / but keep them for to dye for them / For the ancient and wise men
said comynly that it was not good to make and ordeygne that law that is not
Just Whereof Valerius reherceth that there was a man that was named Themistides
which came to the counceyllours of athenes and said that he knew a counceyll
which was right prouffytable for them / But he would tell hit but to but to
one of them whom that they would / And they assigned to him a wise man named
Aristides / And when he had understand him he came again to the other of the
counceyll And said that the counceyll of Themystides was well profitable /
but hit was not Just / how be hit ye may reuolue hit in your mind / And the
counceyll that he said was this / that there were comen two great shipp is fro
lacedome and were arrived in their land. And that hit were good to take them /
And when the counceyll herd him that said / that hit was not Just ner right
/ they left hem all in pees And would not have adoo with all / The vicarye or
Judge of the king ought to be so Just / that he should enploye all his entente
to save the common well And if hit were need to put his life and / lose hit
therefore / we have an ensample of marcus regulus whereof Tullius reherceth in
the book of offices And saint Augustyn also de ciuitate dei how he faught again
them of cartage by see in shippis and was vaynquysshid and taken / Than hit
happend that they of cartage sent him in her message to rome for to have their
prisoners there / for them yt were taken / and so to change one for an other
And made him swear and promise to come again / And so he came to rome And made
proposicion to fore the senate And demanded them of cartage of the senators to
be changed as before is said And than the senators demanded him what counceyll
he gaf Certain said he I cou^ceyll you that ye do hit not in no wise For as
much as the people of rome that they of cartage hold in prison of youris ben
old men and brusid in the war as I am my self / But they that ye hold in
prison of their people is all the flour of all their folk / which counceyll
they took / And than his friends would have hold him and counceyllyd him to
abide there and not return again prisoner in to cartage / but he would never
do so ner abide / but would goo again and keep his oath How well that he knew
that he went toward his death For he had leuyr dye than to break his oath
Valerius reherceth in the sixth book of one Emelye duc of the romans / that in
the time when he had assieged the phalistes / The scole maystre of the children
deceyuyd the children of the gentilmen that he drew him a lityll and a little
unto the tentys of the romans by fair speech. And said to the duc Emelie /
that by the moyan of the children that he had brought to him / he should have
the cite / For their faders were lords and governors. When Emelie had herd
him he said thus to him Thou that art evil and cruel And thou that would
give a gift of great felonnye and of ma^^astye / thou shall ner have not
founden here Duc ne people that resembles the / we have also well laws to keep
in battle and war A^ in our contres and other places / and we wole observe
and keep them unto every man as they ought to be kept And we ben armed against
our enemies yt wole defend them And not against them yt can not save their life
when their contre is taken / as thise lityll children / Thou have vaynquysshid
them as much as is in the by thy new decey^able falsenes and by subtilnes and
not by arms / but I that am a romayn shall vainquysshe them by craft and
strength of arms / And anon he commanded to take the said scole master / And
to bind his hands behind him as a traitor and led hem to the parentis of
the children And when the faders and parentis saw the great courtosie that he
had don to them They opend the yates and yielded them unto him / we read that
hanyball had taken a prince of rome which upon his oath and promise suffrid him
to gone home / and to send him his raunson / or he should come again within a
certain time And when he was at home in his place / he said that he had
deceyuyd him by a false oath And when the senators knew thereof / they
constrained him to return again unto hanyball / Amosflorus tellyth that the
phisicien of king pirrus came on a night to fabrice his aduersarye And promysid
him if he would give him for his labor that he would enpoysone pirrus his
master / when fabricius understood this He did to take him and bind him
hand and foot / and sent him to his maistre and did do say to him word for
word like as the phisicien had said and promysid him to do / And when pirrus
understood this he was greatly ameruaylled of the loyalte and troth of fabrice
his enemy / and said certainly that the son might lighther and sonner be
enpesshid of his course / than fabrice should be let to hold loyalte and
truth / if they than that were not christian were so Just and true and ^
louyd their country and their good renomee / what should we now done than that been christian and that our law is set all upon love and charity / But now a
days there is nothing else in the world but barate Treson deceyte falsenes
and trecherye Men keep not their couenantes promyses. oaths. writings. ne
truth / The subgettis rebelle again their lord / there is now no law kept.
nor fidelite / ne oath holden / the people murmr and rise again their lord and
wole not be subget / they ought to be pi^tous in heart / which is auaillable
to all thing there is pite in effect by compassion / and in word by remission
and pardon / by alms / for to enclyne him self to the pour. For pite Is
nothing ellis but a right great will of a debonaire heart for to help all
men / Valerius reherceth that there was a Judge named sangis which dampened a
woman that had deseruyd the death for to have her heed smyten of or ellis that
she should dye in prison / The Geayler that had pite on the woman put not her
anon to death but put her in the prison / And this woman had a daughter which
came for to se and conforte her mother But allway er she entryd in to the prison
the Iayler serchid her that she should bear no mete ne drink to her mother / but
that she should dye for honger / Than hit happend after this that he meruaylled
much why this woman deyd not / And began to espy the cause why she lyuyd so
long / And fond at last how her daughter gaf souke to her mother / And fed
her with her melke. when the Iayler saw this meruaill / he went and told the
Judge / And when the Judge saw this great pite of the daughter to the mother he
pardoned her and made her to be delivered out of her prison what is that /
that pite ne amolisshith / much people wene that it is against nature and
wondre that the daughter should give the mother to souke / hit were again nature
but the children should be kind to fader and mother / Se^^ca says that the
king of bees has no prykke to stynge with as other bees have. And that nature
has take hit away from him be cause he should have none arms to assaylle them
And this is an example unto princes that they should be of the same condition /
Valerius reherceth in his.v. book of marchus martellus that when he had taken
the cite of siracusane. And was set in the highest place of the cite / he
beheld the great destruction of the people and of the cite / he wept and said
/ thou ought to be sorofull / for so much as thou would have no pite of
thy self / But enjoy the for thou art fallen in the hand of a right debonaire
prince. Also he recounteth when pompeye had conqueryd the king of Germanye
that often times had foughten against the romans And that he was brought to
fore him bounden / he was so pietous that he would not suffer him to be long on
his knees to fore him / but he receyuyd him cortoysly And set the crown
again on his heed and put him in the state that he was to fore / For he had
oppynyon that hit was as worshipful and sittynge to a king to pardone / as to
punysshe. Also he reherceth of a cou^ceyllour that was named poule that did do
bring to fore him a man that was prisonner And as he knelid to fore him he
took him up fro the ground and made him to sytte beside him for to give him
good esperance and hoope And said to the other stondynge by / in this wise. if
hit be great noblesse that we show our self contrary to our enemies / than
this fete ought to be allowed that we show our self debonair to our caytyfs and
prisonners Caesar when he herd the death of cathon which was his aduersarye
said that he had great envy of his glory. And no thing of his patrimonye /
and therefore he left to his children freely all his patrimonye Thus taught
vyrgyle and enseygned the gloryus princes to rewle and govern the people of
rome And saint Augustine de ciuitate de^ says thus Thou emperor govern the
people pietously And make peace ouerall / deporte and forbere thy subgets /
repreue and correct the proud / for so enseyne And teache the the laws / And
hit was wreton unto Alexander / that every prince ought to be pyetous in
punysshynge / And ready for to reward / There is no thing that causes a prince
to be so beloved of his people / As when he speaks to hem swetly / and
co^uersith with hem symply / And all this comes of the root of pity / we read
of the Emperor Traian that his friends repreuyd him of that he was to much
pryue and familier with the common people more than an emperor ought to be / And
he answered that he would be such an emperor as every man desired to have him /
Also we read of Alixander that on a time he ladde his oost forth hastily / and
in that haste he beheld where satte an old knight that was sore a cold Whom
he did do arise and set him in his own sete or siege / what wondre was hit
though ye knights desired to serve such a lord that louyd better their health
than his dignite / The rookes ought also to be humble and meke After the holy
scripture which says / the gretter or in the hier astate that thou art / so
much more ought thou be meker and more humble Valerius reherceth in
his.vii. book that there was an emperor named publius caesar / That did do beat
down his hows which was in the middis of ye market place for as much as hit
was heier than other houses / for as much as he was more glorious in astate
than other / Therefore would he have a less house than other And scipion of
affrique that was so pour of volu^tarie pouerte yt when he was deed / he was
buried at ye dispencis of ye common good / They should be so humble yt they should
leave their offices / and suffer other to take hem when her time comyth / and
do honor to other / for he governs wel^ ye royame yt may govern hit when
he will Valerius says In his third book that fabyan the great had been maistre
counceyllour of his fader his grauntsire / And of his grauntsirs fader and of
all his antecessours And yet did he all his pain and labor / that his sone
should never have that office after him / but for nothing that he mystrusted
his sone / For he was noble and wise and more attemprid than other / but he
would that the office should not allway rest in the familye and hows of the
fabyans Also he reherceth in his seventh book that they would make the said
fabyan emperor / but he excused him and said that he was blind and might not
see for age / but that excusacion might not help him / Than said he to hem /
seek ye and get you another / For if ye make me your emperor I may not suffer
your manners / nor ye may not suffer mine / There was a king of so subtle engyne
That when men brought him the crown / to fore that he took hit / he remembrid
him a lityll and said O thou crown that art more noble than happy For if a
king knew well and parfaytly how that thou art full^ of paryls of thought
and of charge / if thou were on the ground / he would never lift ner take the
up / Remember the that when thou art most glorious / than have some men most
envy on the / and when thou haste most seignourye and lordships than shall
thou have most care. thought and anguysshes / Valpasian was so humble that
when Nero was slain all the people cried for to have him emperor / and many of
his friends came and prayde him that he would take hit upon him / so at the last
he was constrained to take hit upon him / And said to his friends Hit is better
and more to preyse and allow for a man to take thempire against his will / than
for to labor to have hit and to put him self therein / Thus ought they to be
humble and meke for to resseyue worship / Therefore says the bible that Ioab
the sone of Saryne that was captayn of the warn of the king David / when he
came to take and win a Cite / He sent to David and desired him to come to the
war / that the victory should be given to David / And not to him self / Also
they ought to be ware that they change not often times her officers / Josephus
reherceth that the friends of tyberyus meruaylled much why he held his
offycyers so long in their offices with out changynge / And they demanded of
him the cause / to whom he answered / I would change them gladly / if I wyste
that hit should be good for the people / But I saw on a time a man that was
royuyous and full of soores / And many flies satte upon the soores and souked
his blood that hit was meruaylle to see / wherefore I suib^e and chaced them
away. And he than said to me why chacest and smytest away these flies that been
full of my blood / And now shallt then late come other that been hongrye which
shall done to me double pain more than the other did / for the prikke of the
hongrye is more poyngnant the half / than of ye fulle And therefore said he I
leave the officiers in their offices. for they ben all^ rich / and do not so
much euyl^ and harm As the new should do and were pour if I should set hem
in her places / They ought also to be pacyent in herynge of words and in
suffrynge pain on her bodies / as to the first One said to alisander that he
was not worthy to regne. specially when he suffrid that lechery and delight to
have seignoire in him / he suffrid hit patiently / And answered none otherwise
but that he would corrette him self. And take better manners and more honest
Also hit is reherced that Julius cezar was ballyd whereof he had desplaysir so
great that he kempt his heeris that lay on the after part of his heed forward
for to hyde the bare to fore. Than said a knight to him Cezar hit is lighther
And sonner to be made that thou be not ballid / than that I have vsid any
cowardyse in the war of rome / or here after shall do any cowardyse / he
suffrid hit patiently and said not a word / Another reproched him by his
lignage And called him fornier / he answered that hit is better that noblesse
begin in me / than hit should faylle in me / Another callid him tyrant / he
answered if I were one. thou would not say so A knight callid on a time
scipion of affricque foul and old knight in arms And that he knew lityll
good And he answered I was born of my mother a lityll child and feeble and not a
man of arms. And yet he was at all times one of the best and most worthy in
arms that liuyd. Another said to vaspasian / And a wolf should sonner change
his skyn and here / than thou sholdest change thy life For the longer thou
lyuest the mo^e thou coueytest And he answered of these words we ought to
laughe. But we ought to amend our self And punysshe the trespaces. Seneque
reherceth that the king Antygonus herd certain people speak and say evil of
him / And therwas between hem no more but a courtyne / And than he said make
an end of your evil langage lest the king here you / for the courtyne
heereth you well I nowhe. Than as towchynge to the pains that they ought to
suffer patiently Valerius reherceth that a tyrant did do tormente Anamaximenes
and thretenyd him for to cut of his tongue. To whom he said hit is not in thy
power to do so / and forthwyth he bote of his own tongue / And showed hit
with his teth and casted hit in the visage of the Tyrant Hit is a great virtue
in a man that he forgete not to be pacyent in corrections of wrongs / Hit is
better to leave a gylty man vnpunysshyd / than to punysshe him in a wrath or ire
Valerius reherceth that archita of tarente that was master to plato saw that
his feldes and land was destroyed and lost by the necligence of his servant To
whom he said if I were not angry with the I would take vengeance and turmente
the / Lo there ye may see that he had lever to leave to punysshe / than to
pugnysshe more by ire and wrath than by right And therefore says seneque / do
no thing that thou ought to do when you art angry / For when thou art angry
thou would do all things after thy playsir / And if thou can not
va^nquysshe thyn ire / than must thyn ire overcome the / After this ought they
to have wylfull pouerte / like as hit was in the ancient princes / For they
coueyted more to be rich in wit and good manners than in money / And that
reherceth Valerius in his.viii. book that scipion of Affryque was accused unto
the Senate that he should have great tresour / And he answered certes when I
submysed affryque in to your poeste / I held no thing to my self that I might
say this is mine save only the surname of affryque / Ner the affryquans have
not founden in me ner in my brother any avarice / ner yt we were so couetouse
that we had ne had gretter envy to be rich of name than of rychesses / And
therefore says seneque that the king Altagone vsid gladly in his hows vessels
of earth / And some said he did hit for couetyse / But he said that hit was
better and more noble thing to shine in good manners than in vayssell And when
some men demanded him why and for what cause he did so / he answered I am now
king of secylle / and was sone of a potter / and for as much as I doubt
fortune. For when I issued out of the house of my fader and mother / I was
suddenly made rich / wherefore I behold the natiuyte of me and of my lignage /
which is humble and meke / And all these things comes of wilful pouerte /
for he intended more to the common prouffyt than to his owen / And of this
pouerte speaks saint Augustyn in the book of the cite of god That they that
entende to the common prouffyt. sorrow more that wilful pouerte is lost in rome
/ than the richesses of rome / For by the wilful pouerte was the renomce of
good manners kept entierly / thus by this richesse pouerte is not only corrupt
in these days ner the cite ner the manners / but also the thoughts of the men
ben corrupt by this couetyse and by felonnye that is worse than any other
enemy And of the cruelte of the people of rome speaks the good man of noble
memory John the monk late cardynall of rome in the decretall the syxte in the
chapitre gens sancta where he says / that they ben felou^s against god.
contrary to holy things. traytres one to that other. enuyous to her
neighbors. proud unto strangers. rebelle and untrue unto their souerayns
Not suffringe to them that been of lower degree than they and nothing shamfast
to demand things discouenable and not to leave till they have that they
demand / and not plesid but disagreable when they have resseyuyd the yeft They
have their tongues ready for to make great boost / and do lityll / They ben
large in promysynges / And small gyuers / they ben right falls deceyuours / And
right inordent and bitynge detractours / For which thing hit is a great
sorrow to see the humylite the pacyence / And the good wisdom that was woute
to be in this cite of rome which is chief of all the world is peruertid and
turned in to maleheurte and thise euylles / And me thinks that in other
parties of crestiante they have taken ensample of them to do evil / They may
say that this is after the decretale of seygnourye and disobeysance / that
says That such things that the souerayns do / Is lightly and sone taken in
ensample of their subgets / Also thise vicayres should be large and liberal /
In so much that such people as serve them ben duly paid and guerdoned of her
labor / For every man does his labor the better and lightlyer when he sees
that he shall be well paid and rewarded / And we read that Titus the sone of
vaspasian was so large and so liberal / That he gaf and promised somewhat to
every man / And when his most pryuy friends demanded of him why he promysid
more that he might give / he answered for as much as hit apperteyneth not to a
prince that any man should depart sorrowful or tryste fro him / Than hit
happend on a day that he gaf ner promysid no thing to any man And when hit was
even and auysed him self / he said to his friends / O ye my friends this day
have I lost for this day have I don no good / And also we read of Julius Caesar
that he never said in all his live to his knights goo oon but allway he
said come come / For I love allway to be in your company / And he knew well
that hit was less pain and trauayll to the knights when the prince is in her
company that loves hem and comforted hem And also we read of the same Julius
caesar in the book of truphes of philosophers / that there was an Ancient
knight of his that was in paryll of a caas hanging to fore the Iuges of rome
so he called caesar on a time and said to him to fore all men that he should be
his advocate And caesar deliueryd and assigned to him a right good advocate And
the knight said to him O caesar I put no vicaire in my place when thou were in
parill in ye battle of assise / But I faught for the. And than he showed to
him the places of his wounds that he had receyuyd in the battle And than came
caesar in his propre person for to be his advocate and to plete his cause for
him / he would not have the name of unkindness / but doubted that men should say
that he were proud And that he would not do for them that had served him They
that can not do so much / as for to be beloved of her knights / can not love
the knights And this suffices of the rooks.

The third tractate of the offices of the common people. The first chapitre is
of the office of the laborers and werkemen.
FOr as much as the Noble person can not rewle ne govern with out ye
service and work of the people / than hit behooves to deuyse the o^uurages and
the offices of the werkemen Than I shall begin first at the first pawn /
that is in the play of the chesse / And signefieth a man of the common people on
foot For they be all named pietous that is as much to say as footmen And
than we will begin at the pawn which stands to fore the rooke on the
right side of the king for as much as this pawn apperteyneth to serve the
vicaire or lieutenant of the king and other officers under him of necessaryes
of vitayll / And this manner a people is figured and ought be maad in the form
and shappe of a man holding in his right hand a spade or shouell And a rod
in the lift hand / The spade or shouell is for to delue and labor therewith
the earth / And the rod is for to drive and conduyte with all the Bestes unto
her pasture also he ought to have on his gyrdell / a crokyd hachet for to cut
of the supfluytees of the vignes and trees / And we read in the bible that the
first labourer that ever was / was Cayin the first sone of Adam that was so
evil that he slew his brother Abel / for as much as the smoke of his tithes
went strayt unto heaven / And the smoke and fume^ of the tithes of Cayin went
dounward upon the earth And how well that this cause was true / yet was there
another cause of envy that he had unto his brother / For when Adam their f^der
married them for to multyplie ye earth of his ^ignye / he would not marye ner
Join to gyder the two that were born a^^ones / but gaf unto cayin her that was
born with Abel / And to Abel her that was born with cayin / And thus began the
nuye that cayin had against abel / For his wife was fayrer than cayins wife And
for this cause he slough abel with the chekebone of a best and at that time
was never no manner of iron blody of man's blood / And abel was ye first
martier in tholde testament / And this cayin did many other euyl^ things
which I leave / for hit apperteyneth not to my matter / But hit behouet^ for
necessite yt some should labor the earth after ye sin of adam / for to fore
er adam sinned / the earth brought forth fruit with out labor of hands / but
syn he sinned hit must needs be labourid with ye hands of men And for as
much as the earth is mother of all things And that we were first formed and
took our beginning of the earth / the same wise at the last. she shall be the
end unto all us and to all things / And god that formed us of the earth
has ordained that by the labor of men she should give nourysshyng unto all
that lives / and first the labourer of ye earth ought to know his god that
formed and made heaven and earth of naught And ought to have loyaulte and troth
in him self / and despise death for to entende to his labor And he ought to
give thankyngis to him that made him And of whom he receives all his goods
temporal / whereof his life is sustained / And also he is bounden to pay the
dismes and tithes of all his things And not as Cayin did. But as Abell did
of the best that he chese out allway for to give to god and to plese him / For
they that grucche and be greuyd in that they render and give to god the
tienthes of her goods / they ought to be aferd and have dread that they shall
fall in necessite And yt they might be dispoyllyd or robbed by war or by
tempeste that might fall or happen in the country And hit is meruayll though
hit so happen For that man that is disagreable unto god And weneth yt the
multiplynge of his goods temporell comes by the virtue of his own cou^ceyll
and his wit / the which is made by the only ordenance of him that made all
And by the same ordenance is soon taken away fro him that is disagreable / and
hit is reason that when a man haboundeth by fortune in goods / And knows not
god / by whom hit comes / that to him come some other fortune by the which he
may require grace and pardon And to know his god / And we read of the king
David that was first simple and one of the common people / that when fortune had
enhaunsed and set him in great astate / he left and forgate his god / And
fill to aduoultrye and homicyde and other sins / Than anon his own sone
Absalon assaylled and began to persecute him And than when he saw that fortune
was contrary to him / he began to take again his virtuous werkis and required
pardoun and so returned to god again. We read also of the children of ysrael^
that were nyghe enfamyned in desert and sore hongry and thrusty that they prayed
and required of god for remedy / Anon he changed his will and sent to hem
manna / and flessh etc / And when they were replenesshid and fat of the
flessh of bestes and of the manna / they made a calf of gold and worshippid
hit. Which was a great sin and Inyquyte / For when they were hongry they
knew god / And when their belyes were fylde and fatted / they forgid ydoles
and were ydolatrers After this every labourer ought to be faithful and true
That when his maystre delyuereth to him his land to be labored / that he take
no thing to him self but that him ought to have and is his / but labor truly
and take cure and charge in the name of his maistre / and do more diligently
his masters labors than his owen / for the life of ye most great and noble men
next god heth in ye hands of the laborers / and thus all crafts and
occupacions ben ordained not only to suffice to them only / but to the common /
And so hit happeth often time that ye labourer of the earth uses great and
boystous metes / and brings to his master more subtle and more deyntous
metes / And valerius reherceth in his.vi. book that there was a wise and noble
maistre yt was named Anthomus that was accused of a caas of aduoultrye / and as
the cause henge to fore the Iuges / his accusers or denonciatours brought I
labourer that closid his land for so much as they said when his maistre went
to do the aduoultrye / this same servant bare the lantern. whereof Anthonyus
was sore abashed and doubted that he should depose against him But the labourer
that was named papirion said to his master that he should deny his cause
hardyly unto the Iuges For for to be tormentid / his cause should never be
enpeyrid by him / ner nothyng^ should issue out of his mouth whereof he should be
noyed or greuyd And than was the labourer beten and tormentid and brent in many
places of his body But he said never thing whereof his master was hurt or
noyed / But the other that accused his master were punysshid And papiryon was
deliuerid of his pains free and franc / And also tells valerius that there
was another labourer that was named penapion / that served a master whose name
was Themes which was of meruayllous faith to his maystre For hit befell that
certain knights came to his masters hows for to slay him And anon as papiryon
knew hit / he went in to his masters chamber And would not be known For he
did on his masters gown and his ring on his finger / And lay in his bed
And thus put him self in parill of death for to respite his masters life / But
we see now a days many fools that daigne not to use groos metes of laborers.
And flee the course clothing And manners of a servant Every wise man a servant
that truly seruyth his master is free and not bond / But a fool that is over
proud is bond / For the debilite and feebleness of courage that is broken in
conscience by pride Envy. or by couetyse is right seruytude / yet they ought
not to doubt to labor for feere and dread of death / no man ought to love to
much his life / For hit is a fowll thing for a man to re^me to the death for
the enemy of his life / And a wise man and a strong man ought not to flee for
his life / but to issue For there is no man that lives / but he must needs dye.
And of this speaks claudyan and says that all thoo things that the Air
goth about and enuyronned. And all thing that the earth labors / All
thyngys that been contained with in the sea All things that the floodes bring
forth / All things that been nourysshid and all the bestes that been under the
heaven shall depart all from the world / And all shall goo at his commandment
/ As well Kings Princes and all that the world enuyronned and gooth about /
All shall goo this way / Than he ought not to doubt for fere of death. For as
well shall dye the rich as the pour / death makes all thing like and
puts all to an end / And thereof made a noble versifier two versis which
follow Forma. genus. mores. sapie^cia. res. et honores / ^orteruant subita sola
manent merita / Whereof the english is Beaulte. lignage. manners. wysedom.
things and honors / shall ben deffetid by sodeyn death / no thing shall abide
but the merits / And hereof find we in Vitas patrum. that there was an earl a
rich and noble man that had a sone only / and when this sone was of age to
have knowlech of the law / he herd in a sermon that was prechid that death
spares none / ne rich ne pour / and as well dies ye young as the old / and
that the death ought specially to be doubted for.iii. causes / one was / yt
noman knows when he comes / and the second / ner in what state he takes a
man / And the third he wot never whither he shall goo. Therefore each man
should despise and flee the world and live well and hold him toward god And
when this young man herd this thing / he went out of his country and fled
unto a wilderness unto an hermytage / and when his fader had lost him he made
great sorrow / and did do enquere and seek him so much at last he was founden
in the herimtage / and than his fader came theder to him and said / dear sone
come from thens / thou shall be after my death earl and chyef of my lignage / I
shall be lost if thou come not out from thens / And he than that wyste non
otherwise to eschew the ire of his fader bethought him and said / dear fader
there is in your contre and land a right evil custom if hit plese you to put
that away I shall gladly come out of this place and goo with you The fader was
glad and had great Joy And demanded of him what hit was And if he would tell
him he promysid him to take hit away and hit should be left and set a part.
Than he said dear fader there dyen as well the young folk in your country as the
old / do that away I pray you / when his fader herd that he said Dear sone
that may not be ner noman may put that away but god only / Than answered the
sone to the fader / than will I serve him and dwell here with him that may do
that. And so abode the child in the hermytage and lyuyd there in good works
After this hit apperteyneth to a labourer to entende to his labor and flee
ydlenes / And thou ought to know that David preyseth much in the sawlter
the true laborers and says / Thou shall ete the labor of thyn hands and
thou art blessid / and he shall do to the good And hit behooves that the
labourer entende to his labor on the werkedayes for to recuyell and gadre to
gyder the fruit of his labor / And also he ought to rest on the holyday /
both he and his bestes. And a good labourer ought to norysshe and keep his
bestes / And this is signefied by the rod that he has. Which is for to lead
and drive them to the pasture / The first pastor that ever was / was Abel
which was Just and true / and offryd to god the bestes unto his sacrefice /
And him ought he to follow in craft and manners But no man that uses the malice
of Cayin may ensue and follow Abel / And thus hit apperteyneth to the labourer
to set and graffe trees and vygnes / and also to plant and cut them And so
did noe which was the first that planted the vygne after ye deluge and flood
For as Josephus reherceth in ye book of naturell things Noe was he that fond
first the vygne / And he fond him bitter and wild / And therefore he
took.iiii. manners of blood / that is to wete the blood of a lion. the blood of
a lamb. the blood of a swyne. and the blood of an ape and medlid them alto
geder with the earth / And than he cut the vygne / And put this about the
roots thereof. To the end that the bitterness should be put away / and that hit
should be sweet / And when he had dronken of the fruit of this vygne / hit was
so good and mighty that he becam so drunk / that he dispoylled him in such
wise yt his pryuy members might be seen / And his youngest sone chammocqued and
skorned him And when Noe was awakid and was sobre and fasting / he assemblid
his sons and shewid to them the nature of the vygne and of the wyn / And told
to them the cause why yt he had put the blood of the bestes about the root of
the vygne and that they should know well yt otherwhile by ye strength of the
wyn men be made as hardy as the lion and yrous And otherwhile they be made
simple and shamefast as a lamb And lecherous as a swyn / And curyous and full
of play as an Ape / For the Ape is of such nature that when he sees one do a
thing he enforces him to do the same / and so do many when they ben drunk
/ they will meddle them with all officers and matiers that apperteyne no thing
to them / And when they ben fasting and sobre they can scarsely accomplisshe
their own things And therefore valerian reherceth that of auncyente and in
old time women drank no wyn for as much as by dronkenship they might fall
in any filthe or vilonye And as Ouide says / that the wyns otherwhyle
apparaylle the corages in such manner that they ben couenable to all sins
which take away the hertes to do well / They make the pour rich / as long
as the wyn is in his heed And shortly dronkenshyp is the beginning of all
euyllys / And corrompith the body / and destroyed the soul and mynusshith the
goods temporels / And this suffyseth for the labourer.

The second chapitre of the third tractate treteth of the form and manner of
the second pawn and of the manner of a smyth.
THe second pawn yt stands to fore the knight on the right side of the
king has the form and figure of a man as a smyth and that is reason For hit
apperteyneth to ye knights to have bridellys sadellys spores and many other
things made by the hands of smythes and ought to hold an hamer in his right
hand. And in his lift hand a dolabre and he ought to have on his gyrdell a
trowell For by this is signefied all manner of werkemen / as goldsmithes.
marchallis. smithes of all forges / forgers and makers of monoye and all manner
of smythes ben signefyed by the hamer / The carpenters ben signefyed by the
dolabre or squire / And by the trowell we understand all masons and keruars of
stones / tylers / and all them that make howses castles and tours / And to
all these crafty men hit apperteyneth that they be true. Wise and strong /
and hit is need yt they have in hem self faith and loyaulte / For unto the
goldsmythes behooves gold and silver And all other metallys / yren and steel
to other / And unto the carpenters and masons / ben put to their edifices the
bodies and goods of the people / And also men put in the hands of the
maronners body and goods of the people / And in the guard and sewerte of them
men put body and soul in the paryls of the sea and therefore ought they to be
true / unto whom men commytte such great charge and so great things upon her
faith and trust. And therefore says the philosopher / he that leseth his faith
and believe / may lose no gretter ne more thing. And faith is a souerayn good
and comes of the good will of the heart and of his mind And for no necessite
will deceive no man / And is not corrupt for no mede. Valerius reherceth that
Fabius had receyuyd of hanybal certain prisoners that he held of the romans
for a certain some of money which he promysid to pay to the said hanyball /
And when he came unto the senators of rome and desired to have ye money lent
for hem They answered that they would not pay ner lene / And than fabius sent
his sone to rome and made him to selle his heritage and patrimonye / and sent
the money that he resseyuyd thereof unto hanibal^ / And had lever and louyd
better to be pour in his country of heritage / than of believe and faith / But
in these days hit were great folly to have such affiance in much people but
if they had been preuyd before For oftentimes men trust in them by whom they ben
deceyuyd at their need / And it is to wete that these crafty men and werkemen
ben souerainly profitable unto the world And with out artificers and werkmen
the world might not be governed / And know thou verily that all tho things
that been engendrid on the earth and on the sea / ben made and formed for to do
prouffit unto the lignage of man / for man was formed for to have generation /
that the men might help and prouffit each other And here in ought we to follow
nature / For she showed to us that we should do common prouffit one to an other /
And ye first fondement of Justice is that no man should noye ne grieve other But
that they ought do the common prouffit / For men say in reproach That I see of
thyn / I hope hit shall be mine But who is he in these days that entendeth more
to the common prouffit than to his own / Certainly none / But all way a man
ought to have dread and feere of his own hows / when he sees his neighbors
house a fire And therefore ought men gladly help the common prouffit / for men
otherwhile set not be a lityll fire And might quench hit in the beginning /
that afterward makyth a great blasyng fire. And fortune has of no thing so
great playsir / as for to torn and work allway / And nature is so noble a
thing that were as she is she will sustain and keep / but this rewle of
nature has fayllid long time / how well that the decree says that all the
things that been against the law of nature / ought to be taken away and put a
part And he says to fore in the.viii. distinition that the right law of
nature differenceth often times for custom and statutes establisshid / for by
law of nature all thing ought to be common to every man / and this law was of
old time And men wene yet specially yt the trojans kept this law And we read
that the multitude of the Trojans was one heart and one soul / And verayly we
find that in time passid the philosophres did the same / And also hit is to
be supposyd that such as have their goods comune and not propre is most
acceptable to god / For else would not thise religious men as monks freris
chanons obseruantes and all other auowe hem and keep the wilful pouerte that
they ben professid too / For in troth I have my self ben conversant in a
religious house of white freris at gaunt Which have all thing in common among
them / and not one richer than an other / in so much that if a man gaf to a
friar.iii. d or.iiii. d. to pray for him in his mass / as soon as the mass
is done he deliuerith hit to his ouerest or procuratour in which hows ben many
virtuous and devout freris And if that life were not the best and the most
holiest / holy church would never suffer hit in religion And acordynge thereto we
read in plato which says yt the cite is well and Justly gouernid and
ordained in the which no man may say by right. by custom. ne by ordenance /
this is mine / but I say to the certainly that syn this custom came forth to say
this is mine / And this is thyn / no man thought to prefer the common prouffit
so much as his owen / And all w^rkemen ought to be wise and well aduysyd so
that they have none envy ne none evil suspecion one to an other / for god
will that our humayne nature be covetous of two things / that is of Religion.
And of wysedom / but in this caas ben some often times deceyuyd For they take
often times religion and leave wisdom And they take wysedom and reffuse religion
And none may be vraye and true with out other For hit apperteyneth not to a
wise man to do any thing that he may repent him of hit / And he ought to do
no thing against his will / but to do all thing nobly. meurely. fermely. and
honestly And if he have envy upon any. hit is folly For he on whom he has
envy is more honest and of more hauoir than he which is so enuyous / For a
man may have none envy on an other / but be cause he is more fortunat and has
more grace than him self / For envy is a sorrow of courage yt comes of
dysordynance of the prouffit of another man And know thou verily that he that
is full of bounte shall never have envy of an other / But thenuyous man sees
and thinks alleway that every man is more noble / And more fortunat that
himself And says alleway to him self / that man wynneth more than I / and mine
neyghebours have more plente of bestes / and her things multiplye more than
mine / and therefore thou ought know that envy is the most grettest dedely
sin that is / for she tormenteth him that has her within him / with out
tormentynge or doing any harm to him / on whom he has envy. And an enuyous
man has no virtue in him self / for he corrumpeth him self for as much as he
hates allway the welthe and virtues of other / and thus ought they to keep
them that they take none evil suspeco^n For a man naturelly when his affection
has suspecion in any man that he weneth that he does / hit seems to him
verily that it is done. And hit is an evil thing for a man to have suspecion
on him self / For we read that dionyse of zecyll a tyrant Was so suspecionous
that he had so great fere and dread For as much as he was hated of all men /
that he put his friends out of their offices that they had / And put other
strangers in their places for to keep his body / and these such as were right
Cruel and felons / And for fere and doubt of the barbours / he made his
daughters to learn shave and kembe / And when they were great. He would not they
should use any iron to be occupied by them / but to brenne and senge his heeris
/ and manaced them and durst not trust in them / And in like wise they had
none aff^ance in him And also he did do enuyronne the place where he lay with
great diches and broad like a castle / And he entryd by a drawbrygge which
closyd after him / And his knights lay with out with his gardes which
wacchid and kept straytly this forteresse / And when plato saw this Dionyse
king of cezille thus enuyronned and set about with gardes and wacchemen for
the cause of his suspecion said to him openly to fore all men king why have
thou don so much evil and harm / that the behoneth to be kept with so much
people / And therefore I say that hit apperteyneth not to any man that will
truly behave him self in his werkis to be suspecyous / And also they ought to
be strong and seure in their works / And specially they that been masters and
maronners on the sea / for if they be tumerous and ^erdfull they should make a
ferde them that been in their shippis / that know not the paryls / And so hit
might happene that by that dread and fere all men should leave their labor /
And so they might be perisshid and despeyred in their corages / For a ship is
soon perisshid and lost by a lityll tempest / when the governor faylleth to
govern his ship for dread / And can give no counceyll to other than it is no
meruayll / thaugh they be a ferd that been in his governance / And therefore
ought be in them strength force and courage / and ought to considere the peryls
that might fall / And the governor specially ought not to doubt / And if hit
happen that any paryll fall / he ought to promise to the other good hoope /
And hit apperteyneth well / that a man of good and hardy courage be set in
that office / In such wise that he have ferme and seure mind against the
paryls that oftetymes happen in the sea / and with this ought the maroners have
good and ferme creance and believe in god / and to be of good reconforte and of
fair langage unto them that he governs in such paryls / And this suffices
to you as touching the laborers.

The third chapitre of the third book treteth of the office of notaryes
aduocats skryueners and drapers or clothmakers.
THe third pawn which is set to fore the Alphyn on the right side ought to
be figured as a clerk And hit is reason that he should so be / For as much as
among ye common people of whom we speak in this book they plete the differencis
contencions and causes otherwhile the which behooves the Alphins to give
sentence and Judge as Iuges And hit is reason that the Alphin or Judge have his
notarye / by whom ye process may be wreton / And this pawn ought to be made
and figured in this mamere / he must be made like a man that holds in his
right hand a pair of sheres or forcetis / and in the lift hand a great knyf
and on his gurdell a penuer and an yukhorn / and on his ^ere a pen to write
with And that been the Instrumentis and the offices that been made and put in
writynge autentyque / and ought to have passed to fore the Iuges as libelles
writtes condempnacions and sentences / And that is signefied by the scriptoire
and the pen and on that other part hit appertains to them to cut cloth.
shere. dighte. and dye / and that is signefied by the forcettis or sheres / and
the other ought to shave berdes and kembe the heeris / And the other ben
coupers. coryers. t^wiers. skynners. bouchers and cordwanners / and these ben
signefyed by the knyf that he holds in his hand and some of thise foresaid
crafty men ben named drapers or clothmakers for so much as they work with
wolle. and the Notayres. skynners. coryours. and cardewaners work by skynnys
and hydes As parchemyn velume. peltrye and cordewan / And the Tayllours.
cutters of cloth. ^euars. fullars. dyers / And many other crafts ocupye and
use wulle / And all these crafty men and many other that I have not named /
ought to do their craft and mestyer / where as they ben duly ordained
Curyously and truly / Also there ought to be among these crafty men amyable
company and true / honest contenance / And truth in their words / And hit
is to wete that the notaries ben right profitable and ought to be good and
true for the common And they ought to keep them fro appropriynge to them self
that thing yt apperteyneth to the common And if they be good to them self /
they ben good to other. And if they be evil for them self / they ben evil for
other And the processes that been made to fore the Iuges ought to ben wreton and
passid by them / and hit is to wete that by their writynge in the processis may
come much prouffit And also if they write otherwise than they ought to do /
may ensewe much harm and damage to the common Therefore ought they to take good
heed that they change not ne corrumpe in no wise the content of the sentence.
For than ben they first forsworn And ben bounden to make amends to them that
by their tricherye they have endomaged / And also ought they to read visit and
to know the statutes. ordenances and the laws of the cytees of the contre /
where they dwell and enhabite / And they ought to considere if there be any
thing therein contained against right and reason / and if they find any thing
contraire / they ought to admoneste and warn them that govern / that such
things may be changed into better astate / For custom establisshid against
good manners and against the faith / ought not to be holden by right. For as hit
is said in the decree in the chapitre to fore / all ordenance made against
right ought to be holden for naught Alas who is now that advocate or notaire
that has charge to write and keep sentence that puts his entente to keep
more the common prouffit or as much as his owen / But all dread of god is put
a back / and they deceive the simple men And drawn them to the courts
disordinatly and constrained them to swear and make oaths not couenable / And
in assemblyng the people thus to gyder they make moo traysons in the cytees than
they make good alyances And otherwhile they deceive their souerayns / when they
may do hit covertly For there is no thing at this day that so much greueth
rome and Italye as does the college of notaries and advocates publicque / For
they ben not of oon a cord / Alas and in Eugeland what hurt done the
aduocats. men of law. And attorneyes of court to the common people of ye royame
as well in the spirituell law as in the temporal / how torn they the law
and statutes at their pleasir / how ete they the people / how enpouere they the
comynte / I suppose that in all Cristendom are not so many pletars attorneys
and men of the law as ben in england only / for if they were nombrid all that
lange to the courts of the channcery kings benche. common place. cheker.
ressayt and hell And the bag berars of the same / hit should amounte to a
great multitude And how all these live and of whom. if hit should be vttrid
and told / hit should not be byleuyd. For they entende to their synguler well
and prouffyt and not to the common / how well they ought to be of good will to
gyder / and admoneste and warn the cytes each in his right in such wise that
they might have pees and love one with an other And tullius says that
frendshippe and good will that one ought to have against an other for the well
of him that he loves / with the semblable will of him / ought to be put forth
to fore all other things / And there is no thing so resembling and like to
the bees that maken honye ne so couenable in prosperity and in aduersite as is
love / For by love gladly the bees holden them to gyder / And if any trespace
to that other anon they run upon the malefactor for to punysshe him / And
verray true love faylleth never for well ne for evil / and the most sweet and
the most confortynge thing is for to have a friend to whom a man may say his
secret / as well as to him self / But verayly amytye and friendship is sometime
founded upon some thing delectable And this amytye comes of yongthe / in the
which dwells a disordinate heete.

And otherwhile amytie is founded upon honest / And this amytie is virtuous /
Of the which tullius says yt there is an amytie virtuous by the which a man
ought to do to his friend all that he requires by rayson For for to do to him
a thing dishonneste it is against the nature of verray frendshipe and amytie /
And thus for frendshipe ne for favor a man ought not to do any thing
unreasonable against the common prouffit ner against his faith ne against his oath /
for if all tho things that the friends desire and require were accomplisshid
and done / hit should seem that they should be dishoneste coniuracions / And they
might otherwhile more grieve and hurt than prouffit and aid / And hereof says
seneque that amytie is of such will as the friend will / And to reffuse that
ought to be reffusid by rayson / And yet he says more. that a man ought to
allow and preyse his friend to fore the people / and to correct and to chastyse
him pryuyly. For the law of amytie is such. For a man ought not to demand
ner do to be done to his friend no vyllayns thing that ought to be kept
secret And valerian says that it is a fowll thing and an evil excusacion /
if a man conffesse that he has done any evil for his friend against right and
rayson / And says that there was a good man named Tassile which herd one his
friend repuyre of him a thing dishonneste which he denied and would not do
And than his friend says to him in great dispyte / what need have I of thy
friendship and amytie when thou wylt not do that thing that I require of the
And Tassile answered to him / what need have I of the friendship and of the
amytie of the / if I should do for the thing dishoneste And thus love is
founded otherwhile upon (...) profitable / and this love endures as long as
he sees his prouffit And hereof men say a common proverb in england / that
love lasts as long as the money endures / and when the money faylleth than
there is no love / and varro reherceth in his sommes / that ye rich men ben
all louyd by this love / for their friends ben like as ye husk which is
about the grayn / and no man may prove his friend so well as in aduersite / or
when he is pour / for the very true friend faylleth at no need / And seneque
says yt some follow the emperor for riches / and so done ye f^^es the honey
for the swetenes / and the wolf the karayn And thise company follow the proye
/ and not the man And tullius says that Tarquyn ye proud had a neuewe of his
suster which was named brutus and this neuewe had banysshid tarquyn out of rome
and had sent him in exyle / And than said he first that he parceyuyd and knew
his friends which were true and untrue / and yt he never perceived a fore
time when he was puyssant for to do their will / and said well that the love
that they had to him / endured not but as long as it was to them profitable
/ and therefore ought all the rich men of the world take heed / be they Kings
Princes or du^s to what people they do prouffit and how they may and ought be
louyd of their people / For cathon says in his book / see to whom thougyuyst /
and this love which is founded upon their prouffit / which faylleth and
endures not / may better be called and said marchandyse than love / For if we
repute this love to our prouffit only / and nothing to the prouffyt of him
that we love / It is more marchandyse than love / For he byeth our love for the
prouffit that he does to us / and therefore says the versifier thise two versis
Tempore felici multi murmerantur amici Cum (...)ina perit nullus amicus erit /
which is to say in English that as long as a man is ewrous and fortunat he
has many friends but when fortune torneth and perisshith. there abides not to
him one friend / And of this love ben louyd the meadows. feldes. Trees and the
bestes for the prouffit that men take of them / But the love of the men ought
to be charity. very gracious and pure by good faith / And the very true
friends ben known in pure aduersite / and pers alphons says in his book of
moralite that there was a philosophre in arabye that had an only sone / of whom
he demanded what friends he had gotten him in his life And he answered that he had
many And his fader said to him / I am an old man / And yet could I never find
but one friend in all my life / And I trow verily that it is no little thing
for to have a friend / and hit is well gretter and more a man to have many /
And hit appertains and behooves a man to assaye and preue his friend er he
have need And than commanded the philosopher his sone / that he should goo and
slay a swyne / and put hit in a sack / and feign that hit were a man deed
that he had slain and bear hit to his friends for to burye hit secretly / And
when the sone had don as his fader commanded to him and had required his friends
one after an other as a fore is said / They deuyed him / And answered to him
that he was a vylayne to require and desire of them thing that was so
peryllous And than he came again to his fader and said to him how he had
required all his friends / And that he had not founden one that would help
him in his need And than his fader said to him that he should goo and require
his friend which had but one / and require him that he should help him in his
need And when he had required him / Anon he put out all his main out of
his hows / And when they were out of the way or a sleep he did do make
secretly a pytte in the ground / And when hit was ready and would have buried
the body / he fond hit an hog or a swyne and not a man / And thus this sone
preu^yd this man to be a very true friend of his fader / And preuyd that his
friends were falls friends of fortune / And yet reherceth the said piers Alphons
/ That there were two marchantes one of Bandach and that other of Egipte which
were so Joined to gyder by so great frendshippe that he of Bandach came on a
time for to see his friend in Egipte / of whom he was receyuyd right honorably
And thy^ merchant of Egipte had in his hows a fair young maiden whom he should
have had in marriage to himself / Of the which maid this merchant of Bandach
was esprysed with her love so ardantly that he was right seek / And that men
supposid him to dye. And than the other did do come the phisicyens which
said that in him was none other sekenes sauf passion of love / Than he axid of
the seek man if there were any woman in his hows that he louyd and made all
the women of his hows to come to fore him / And than he chees her that should
have been that others wife and said that he was seek for the love of her / Than
his friend said to him Friend conforte your self / For trewly I give her to you
to wife with all the dowayre that is given to me with her / And had lever to
suffer to be with out wife than to lose the body of his friend. And than he of
Bandach wedded the maid. And went with his wife and with his richesse again in
to his country And after this anon after hit happend that the merchant of
Egipte be came so pour by evil fortune / that he was constrained to seche and
beg his bread by the country in so much that he came to bandach. And when he
entrid in to the town hit was derke night that he could not find the hows of
his friend / but went and lay this night in an old temple / And on the morn
when he should issue out of the temple / the officers of the town arestid him
and said that he was an homycide and had slain a man which lay there deed And
ano^n he confessid hit with a good will / And had leuyr to ben hangid / than
to dye in that miserable and pour life that he suffrid And thus when he was
brought to Judgment And sentence should have been given against him as an homicide
/ his friend of bandach came and saw him and anon knew yt this was his good
friend of Egipte And forthwyth stepped in and said that he him self was culpable
of the death of this man / and not that other / and enforced him in all manners
for to deliver and excuse that other / And than when that he that had don the
feet and had slain the man saw this thing / he considerid in him self that
these two men were Innocente. of this feet / And doubting the dyuyn Judgment
he came to fore the Judge and confessid all the feet by order / And when the
Judge saw and herd all this matter / and also the causes he considerid the
ferme and true love that was between the two friends And understood the cause
why that one would save that other / and the troth of the fayte of the homicide
And than he pardoned all the feet hoolly and entierly / and after the merchant
of bandach brought him of egipte with him in to his house / and gaf to him his
suster in marriage / and departid to him half his goods / And so both of hem
were rich / And thus were they both very faithful and true friends /
Furthermore Notaires. men of law and crafty men should and ought to love each
other And also ought to be contynent chaste and honest / For by their crafts
they ought so to be by necessite / For they converse and accompanye them often
time with women And therefore hit apperteyneth to them to be chaste and honest
And that they meue not the women ner entyse them to law he / and Iape by any
disordinate ensignees or tokens / Titus liuy^s reherceth that the philosopher
democreon did do put out his eyes for as much as he might not behold the
women with out flesshely desire / And how well hit is said before that he did
hit for other certain cause yet was this one of the pryncipall causes / And
Valerian tells that there was a young man of rome of right excellent beauty /
And how well that he was right chaste / For as much as his beauty meuyd many
women to desire him / in so much that he understood that the parents and
friends of them had suspecion in him / he did his visage to be cut with a
knyf and lancettis endlonge and overthwart for to deforme his visage / And had
lever have a foul visage and disformed / than the beauty of his visage should
meue other to sin / And also we read that there was a Nonne a virgyne did do
put out both her eyes For as much as the beauty of her eyes meuyd a king to
love her / which eyes she sent to the king in a present / And also we read
that plato the right rich and wise phylosophre left his own land and
Contre. And cheese his mansion and dwelling in a chadomye a town / which was
not only destroyed but also was full of pestelence / so that by the cure and
charge and customance of sorrow that he there suffrid / might eschew the
heetes and occasions of lecherye / And many of his disciples did in like wise
/ Helemand reherceth that demostenes the philosopher lay ones by a right noble
woman for his disporte / and playnge with her he demanded of her what he should
give to have to do with her / And she answered to him / a thousand pens / and
he said again to her I should repent me to bye hit so dear / And when he
aduysed him that he was so sore chauffid to speak to her for tacco^plssh his
flesshely desire / he dispoylled him all naked and went and put him in the
mids of the snow And ouide reherceth that this thing is the least that may
help and most grieve the lovers And therefore saint Augustyn reherceth in his
book de Ciuita^d^i that there was a right noble romayne named mercu^ian that wan
and took the noble cite of siracuse And to fore er he did do assaylle hit or
befyghte hit / and er he had do be shed any blood / he wept and shed many
treris to fore the cite And that was for the cause that he doubted that his
people should defoyle and corrumpe to much dishonestly the chastyte of the town
And ordained upon pain of death that no man should be so hardy to take and
defoylle any woman by force what that ever she were / After this the craftymen
ought to understand for to be true / and to have truth in her mouths And
that their deeds follow their words For he that says one thing and does
another / he condempneth him self by his word Also they ought to see well to
that they be of one Acorde in good. by entente. by word. and by deed / so that
they ben not discordant in no caas / But every man have pure veryte and troth
in him self / For god him self is pure verite / And men say comynly that
truth seeks none hernes ne corners / And truth is a virtue by the which
all dread and fraud is put away / Men say truly when they say that they
know / And they that know not truth / ought to know hit / And alleway use
truth / For Saint Austyn says that they that wene to know truth / And
lyuyth evil and viciously It is folly if he knows hit not / And also he
says in an other place that is better to suffer pain for truth. Than for to
have a benefete by f^lsenes or by flaterye. And man that is called a best
reasonable and does not his works after reason and truth / Is more bestyall
than any best brute / And know ye that for to come to the truth / Hit
comes of a raysonable forsight in his mind / And lyenge comes of an
outrageous and ^^ntrarye thought in his mind / For he that lies wetyngly /
Knows well that hit is against the truth that he thinks / And hereof
speaks Saint Bernard and says / That the mouth that lies destroys the
soul / And yet says Saint Austyn in an other place For to say any thing /
And to do the contrary. makes doctrine suspecious / And know ye verily that
for to lie is a right perilous thing to body and soul For the lie that the
ancient enemy made Eve and adam to believe him / made hem for to be dampened
with all their lignage to the death pardurable And made hem to be cast out of
Paradyse terrestre / For he made them to believe that god had not forboden them
the fruit. But only be cause they should not know that her master knew But
how well that the devil said thise words yet had she double entente to hem
both For they knew ano^n as they had tasted of the fruit that they were
dampened to the death pardurable / And god knew hit well to fore But they
supposid well to have known many other things And to be like unto his
knowleche and science And therefore says saint poule in a pistyll / hit ne
apperteyneth to saure or know more than behooves to saure or know / but to
sauoure or know by mesure or sobrenes / And valerian reherceth that there was a
good woman of siracusane that would not lie unto the king of secylle which was
named dyonyse And this king was so full of tyranny and so cruel that all
the world desired his death and cursid him / Saauf this woman only which was
so old that she had seen three or.iiii. kings regnynge in the contre / And
every morning as soon as she was risen she prayed to god that he would give unto
the tyrant good life and long And that she might never see his death / And when
the king dyonise knew this he sent for her And meruayllid much hereof For he
knew well that he was sore behated / And demanded her / what cause meuyd her
to pray for him. And she answered and said to him Sire when I was a maid we had
a right evil tyrant to our king of whom we coueyted sore the death And when he
was ded there came after him a worse / of whom we coueyted also the death / And
when we were deliueryd of him / thou camst to be our lord which art worste of
all other. And now I doubt if we have one after the he shall be worse than
thou art / And therefore I shall pray for the And when dionyse understood that
she was so hardy in sayynge the truth / he durst not do tormente her for
shame be cause she was so old.

The fourth chapitre of the third book treteth of the manner of the fourth pawn
and of the merchants or changers.
THe fourth pawn is set to for the king And is formed in the form of a man
holding in his right hand a balance / And the weight in the lift hand / And to
fore him a table And at his gurdell a purse fulle of monoye ready for to give to
them that require hit And by this people ben signefied the marchans of cloth
lynnen and woollen and of all other marchandises And by the table that is to for
him is signefied ye changeurs / And they that leave money / And they that bye
and selle by the weight ben signefyed by the balances and weight And the
customers / ^ollers / and resseyuours of rentes and of money ben signefied by
the purse And know ye that all they that been signefied by this people ought to
^lee auaryce and couetyse / And eschew brekynge of the days of payement / And
ought to hold and keep their promyssis / And ought also to render and restore
y^ / that is given to them to keep / And therefore hit is reason that this people
be set to for ye king for as much as they signefie the resscyuours of the
tresours royal that ought allway to be ready to fore ye king and to answer
for him to the knights and other persons for their wages and souldyes And
therefore have I said that they ought to flee avarice. For avarice is as much to
say as an adourer or as worshipar of falls images / and hereof says Tullius that
avarice is a couetise to get yt thing that is above necessite / and it is a
love disordinate to have any thing And it is one of the werst thyngis that is
And specially to princes and to them that govern the things of the comunete
And this vice causes a man to do evil / And this doing evil is when hit
regneth in old men And hereof says Seneque That all wordly things ben
mortifyed and appetissid in old men reserved auaryce only / which alleway
abides with him and dies with him But I understand not well the cause whereof
this comes ne wherefore hit may be And hit is a foul thing and contrary to
reason That when a man is at end of his Journey for to length his viage and to
ordeyne more vitayll than him behooves And this may well be lykened to the
auarycious wolf For the wolf does never good till he be deed And thus it is
said in the prouerbis of the wisemen / that thauaricious man does no good till
that he be ded / And he desires no thing but to live long in this sin For
the couetouse man certainly is not good for any thing For he is evil to
himself and to the rich and to the pour. And find cause to gayn say their
desire / and hereof reherceth seneque and sayt^ that Antigonus was a covetous
prince / and when Tinque which was his friend required of him a besau^t / he
answered to him that he demanded more than hit apperteyned to him And than
tinque constrained by great necessite axid and required of him a penny / And he
answered to him that hit was no yefte couenable for a king and so he was allway
ready to find a cause naught to give For he might have given to him a besau^t
as a king to his friend / And the penny as to a pour man And there is no thing
so little / but that the humanyte of a king may give hit Avarice full of
couetyse is a manner of all vices of luxurye And Josephus reherceth in the book
of ancient histories / that there was in rome ^ right noble lady named Paulyne
/ And was of the most noble of rome / right honest for the noblesse of
chastete / which was married in the time that the women gloryfied them in their
chastete unto a young man fair. noble. and rich above all other / and was
like and semblable to his wife in all caasis / And this paulyne was beloved of
a knight named emmerancian And was so ardautly esprysed in her love that he
sent to her many right rich yeftes / And made to her many great promissis /
but he might never t^^ne the heart of her which was on her side also cold and
hard as marbill But had lever to reffuse his yeftes and his promises. Than to
entende to couetise and to lose her chastete / and we ^ede also in the
historyes of rome that there was a noble lady of rome / which lyuyd a solitarye
life and was chaste and honest / And had gadrid to gyder a great some of gold /
And had hid hit in the earth in a pytte with in her house / And when she was ded
/ the bishop did do burye her in the church well and honestly / And anon
after this gold was founden and born to the bishop / And the bishop bad to
cast hit in to the pytte where she was buried / And.iii. days men herd her
cry and make great noise / and say that she brennyd in great pain / and they
herd her often times thus tormentid in ye church / the neighbors went to the
bishop and told him thereof / and ye bishop gaf hem leave to open the sepulcre
/ and when they had opend hit / they fond all the gold molten with fire full
of sulphre / And was poured and put in her mouth / and they herd one say /
thou desiredest this gold by couetyse take hit and drink hit / And than they
took the body out of the tomb And hit was cast out in a preuy place Seneque
reherceth in the book of the cries of women that avarice is foundement of all
vices / And valerian reherceth that avarice is a ferdfull guard or kepar of
rychessis for he that has on him or in his keeping much money or other
rychessis / is allway a ferd to lose hit or to be robbid or to be slain
therefore / And he is not ewrous ner happy that by couetyse geteth hit / And
all the euyllys of this vice of avarice had a man of rome named septemulle For
he was a friend of one named tarchus And this septemulle burnt so sore and so
cruelly in this sin of couetyse / that he had no shame to smite of the head
of his friend by trayson / For as much as one framosian had promised to him as
much weight of pure gold as the heed weyed And he bare the said heed upon a
staf through the cite of rome / and he wyded the brayn out thereof and fyld hit
full of leed for to weye the heuyer This was a right horrible and cruel
avarice Ptolome king of the Egipciens poursewed avarice in an other manner For
when anthome emperor of rome saw that he was right rich of gold and silver /
he had him in great hate and tormentid him right cruelly And when he should
perish be cause of his richessis / he took all his hauoyr and put hit in a
ship And went with all in to the hye see to the end for to drown and
perish there the ship and his rychesses be cause Anthony his enemy should
not have hit / And when he was there he durst not perisshe hit ner might not
find in his heart to depart from hit / but came and brought hit again in to
his hows where he resseyuyd the reward of death therefore. And with out doubt
he was not lord of the richesse but the richesse was lady over him / And
therefore hit is said in proverb that a man ought to s^ignorye over the riches
/ and not for to serve hit / and if thou can dewly use thy richesse than she
is thy chamberyer / And if thou can not depart from hit and use hit honestly
at thy playsir / know verily yt she is thy lady For the richesse never
satisfies the couetouse / but the more he has / the more he desires / And
saluste says that avarice distourblith faith poeste honest and all these
other good virtues / And takes for these virtues pride. cruelte. And to
forgete god / And says that all things be vendable And after this they ought
to be ware that they lene not to much / ner make so great creances by which
they may f^lle in pouerte / For saint Ambrose says upon to bye. pouerte has
no law for to owe hit is a shame / and to owe and not pay is a more shame /
if you be pour beware how thou berowest / and think how thou may pay and
render again if you be rich you have none need to borowe and axe / and it is
said in the proverbs yt hit is fraud to take / that you wilt not ner may
render and pay again / and also hit is said in reproach / when I leave I am thy
friend / and when I axe I am thy enemy / as woe says / god at the le^y^ge / and
the devil at rendrynge / And seneque says in his auctorites / that they yt
gladly borowe / ought gladly to pay / and ought to surmonte in courage to love
hem the better be cause they* lene hem and aid hem in her need For for
benefetes and good tornes done to a man ought to give him thankinges therefore /
And much more ought a man to repaye that Is lent him in his need / But now in
these days many men by lenynge of their money have made of their friends
enemies / And hereof speaks Domas the philosopher and says that my friend
borrowed money of me / And I have lost my friend and my money attones / There was
a merchant of Gene and also a chaungeour / whose name was Albert gauor / And
this albert was a man of great troth and loyaulte / for on a time there was a
man came to him and said and affermed that he had delyueryd in to his bank.v.
honderd floryns of gold to keep which was not troth for he lied / which five
honderd floryns the said Albert knew not of / ner could find in all his
books any such money to him due And this liar could not bring no wytnessis /
but began to braye. cry and deffame the said albert And than this Albert
callid to him this merchant and said / Dear friend take here v* honderd florms
which thou affermest and say that thou have deliuerid to me And forthwyth
told hem and took hem to him And lo this good man had lever to lose his good
than his good name and renome And this other merchant took these florins that
he had wrongfully receyuyd / and enployed them in diuerce merchandise in so
much that he gate and encresid and wan with them.xv. thousand florins And when
he saw that he approchid toward his death / and that he had no children He
establisshid albert his heyr in all thingis And said that with the.v. honderd
florms that he had receyuyd of albert falsely / he had gotten all yt he had in
the world And thus by dyuyne pourueance he that had be a thief fraudelent / was
made afterward a true procurour and attorney of the said albert / But now in
this days there ben marchau^s that do merchandise with other men's money which
is taken to hem to keep / And when they ben required to repaye hit they have no
shame to deny hit appertly / whereof hit happend that there was a merchant
which had a good and a great name and renome of keeping well such things as
was delyueryd to him to keep / But when he saw place and time / he reteynyd
hit like a thief / So hit befelle that a merchant of with out forth herd the
good report and fame of this man / came to him and deliuerid him great tresour
to keep / And this tresour abode three yer in his keeping. And after this three
yer this merchant came and required to have his good deliueryd to him agaym /
And this man knew well that he had no record ne wytnes to preue on him this
duete / Nor he had no obligacion ne writing of him thereof / In such wise that
he denied all entyerly / And said plainly he knew him not. And when this good
man herd and understood this. he went sorowfully and weeping from him so
far and long that an old woman met with him / And demanded of him the
cause of his weeping / And he said to her / woman hit apperteyneth no thing to
the Go thy way / And she prayed him that he would tell her the cause of his
sorrow / For parauenture she might give him counceylle good and prouffytable.
And than this man told to her by order the ^aas of his fortune / And the old
woman that was wise and subtle demanded of him if he had in that cite any
friend which would be faithful and true to him And he said ye that he had
dyuerce friends / Than said she goo thou to them and say to them that they do
ordeyne and bye dyuerce cofres and chestie / And that they do fylle them with
some old things of no value / and that they feign And say that they be full
of gold. silver and other Jewels and of much great tresour / And than that
they bring them to this said merchant And to say to him that he would keep
them / For as much as they had great trust and affiance in him And also that
they have herd of his great truth and good renome / And also they would goo in
to a fer contre And should be long er they returned again And whilis they speak
to him of this matter / thou shall come upon them and require him that he do
deliuere to the / that thou tokest to him / And I trow be cause of tho good
men that than shall profre to him the said tresour / And for the couetise to
have hit / he shall deliuere to the thy good again / But beware late him not
know in no wise that they ben thy friends ner of thy knowleche This was a
great and good cou^ceyll of a woman And verily hit comes of nature oftentimes
to women to give counceyll shortly and vnauysedly to things that been in doubt
or perilous and needs hasty remedy / And as ye have herd / this good man
did And did after her counceyll And came upon them when they spack of the
matter to the merchant for to deliuere to him the said cofres to keep which his
friends had feigned and required of him that he had taken to him to keep / and
than ano^n the said merchant said to him I know the now well. For I have
auysed me that thou art such a man / And camst to me such a time / And
deliuerest to me such a thing which I have well kept / And than called his
clerck / and bad him goo fecche such a thing in such a place / and deliuere
hit to that good man For he deliuerid hit to me / And than the good man
receyuyd his good. And went his way right Ioyously and gladd / And this
merchant trycheur and deceyuour was defrauded from his evil malice / And he ne
had neither that one ne that other any thing that was of value / And therefore
hit Is said in proverb to defraude the beguylar is no fraud / And he that
does well follows our lord And seneke says that charity enseygneth and
techeth that men should pay well For good payement is sometime good confession
/ And this merchant trycheour and deceyuour resembles and Is like to an hound
that bears a chese in his mouth when he swymmeth over a watre For when he is
on the watre He sees the shadow of the chese in the watre / And than he
weneth hit be an other chese / And for couetyse to have that / he openth his
mouth to cacche that / And than the chese that he bare fallyth down in to the
watre / And thus he loses both two / And in the same wise was served this
merchant deceynour / For for to have the coffres / which he had not seen / He
deliueryd again that he would have holden wrongfully and thus by his couetise
and propre malice he was deceyuyd / And therefore hit apperteyneth to every good
and wise man to know and considere in him self how much he had resseyuyd of
other men / And upon what condition hit was deliuerid to him And hit is to wete
yt this thing apperteyneth to resseyuours and to chaungeours And to all true
marchans and other what some euyr they be / and ought to keep their books of
resaytes and of payements of whom and to whom and what time and day. and if ye
demand what thing makyth them to forgete such things as ben taken to them
to keep I answer and say that hit Is great couetyse for to have tho things
to them self and never to depart from them / And hit is all her thought and
desire to assemble all the good that they may get For they believe on none
other god / but on her richessis their hertes ben so obstynat / and this
suffices of the marchantes.

This fyfth chapitre of the third book treteth of phisiciens spicers and
Apotyquaryes.
THe pawo^n that is set to fore the queen signefyeth the phisicyen / spicer
and Apotyquaire / and is formed in the figure of a man / And he is set in a
chayer as a maystre and holds in his right hand a book / And an ample or a
box with oynementis in his lift hand / And at his gurdell his Instrumentis of
iron and of silver for to make Incysions and to search wounds and hurtes / and
to cut apostumes / And by these things ben known the cyrurgyens / By the
book ben understood the phisicyens / and all gramaryens. logicyens /
maistres of law. of Geometrye. Arismetryque. music and of astronomye / And
by the ampole / ben signefyed the makers of pigmentaries spicers and
apotiquayres / and they that make confections and confytes and medecynes made
with precious spyces And by the ferremens and Instrumentis that hangen on the
gurdell ben signefied the cyrurgyens and the maistres And know ye for certain
that a maystre and phisicyen ought to know the proporcions of lettres of
gramayre / the monemens the conclusions and the sophyms of logyque. the
gracious speech and utterance of rethorique / the mesures of the hours and
days / and of the course and astronomye / the nombre of arsmetryk / and the
Joyous songs of musyque And of all these tofore named / the maistres of
rethorique ben the chyef maistres in speculatyf / And the two last that been
practisiens and werkers ben called phisicyens and cyrurgyens / how well they
ben sage and curyous in these sciences / And how well that man's life is
otherwhile put in thordonance of the phisicyen or cyrurgyen / if he have not
sagesse and wysedom in him self of dyuerce wrytynges and is not expert / And
medlyth him in the craft of phisique / He ought better be called a s^ear of
people than a phisicyen or cyrurgyen. For he may not be a maystre but if he be
sewre and expert in the craft of phisike that he s^e not moo than he ^^^eth and
makes hoole / And therefore says Auy^emie in an Enphormye / if thou curest the
seek man. And know not the cause / whereof the maladye ought to be cured /
Hit ought to be said that thou have cured him by fortune and ha^pe more than by
any coming. And in all these manner of people / There ought to be incur^e of
good manners / Curtoysie of words / Chastity of the body promysse of health /
And as to them that been seek contynuell visitacion of them / And they ought to
enquere the cause of theye sekenessis and the signs and tokens of their
maladyes / As is rehercid in the books of the auctours by right great
diligence / And specially in the books of ypocras galyene and of Auycene And
when many masters and phisicyens ben assemblid to fore the pacyent or seek man
/ They ought not there to argue and dispute one against an other / But they
ought to make good and simple colacion to geder. In such wise as they be not
seen in their desputynge on^ against an other / for to encroche and get more
glory of the world to them self / than to trete the salute and health of the
pacyent and seek man / I meruayll why that when they see and know that when
the seek man has great need of health wherefore than they make gretter
objection of contraryousnes for as much as the life of man is demened and put
among them but hit is be cause that he is reputed most sage and wise that
argues and brings in most subtyltes / And all this manner is among
doctors of law that treteth no thing of man's life. But of temporelle
things / that he is holden most wise and best learned / that by his counceyll
can best acorde the contencions and discencions of men And therefore ought the
phisicyens and cyrurgyens leave when they be to fore the seek men all
dissencions and contrariousnes of words / in such wise that hit appear that
they study more for to cure the seek men than for to despute And therefore is
the phisicien duly set to fore the queen / So that it is figured that he
ought to have in himself chastity and contynence of body. For hit apperteyneth
sometime unto the phisicien to visit and cure Queen's duchesses and countesses
and all other ladies and see and behold some secret sekenessis that fall
and come otherwhile in the secretis of nature And therefore hit apperteyneth to
them that they be chaste and follow honest and chastity / and that they be
ensample to other of good contynence / For valerian reherceth that ypocras was
of meruayllous contynence of his body / For when he was in the scoles of
Athenes / he had by him a right fair woman which was common And the young
scolers and the Ioly felaws that were students promisyd to the woman a besan^t
/ if she might or could torn the courage of ypocras for to have to done with
her / And she came to him by night and did so much by her craft that she lay
with him in his bed / but she could never do so much yt she might corrumpe
his chaste living ne defoule the crown of his conscience / and when the young
men knew that she had been with him all the might And could not change his
contynence / they began to mocque her / And to axe and demand of her the
besant that they had given to her. And she answered That hit was holden a gaged
upon an image / For as much as she might not change his contynence she called
him an image / And in semblable wise reherceth Valerian of Scenocrates
philosopher that there lay with him a woman all night And tempted him
disordina^ly / but that right chaste man / made never semblant to her / Ner he
never remeuyd from his ferme purpoos / In such wise as she departid from him
all confusid and shamed / Cornelius scipion that was sent by the romans for
to govern spain / as soon as he entryd in to the castellis and in to the
towns of that land He began to take away all the things that miht styre or
meue his men to lecherye wherefore men said that he drof and chared out of the
oste moo than two thousand hourdellys / And he that was wise knew well that
delight of lecherye corrupted and apayred the corages of tho men that been
abandonned to that same delight / And hereof hit is said in the fables of the
poets in the first book of the Truphes of the Philosophers by figure. That
they that entryd in to the fontayne of the sirenes or mermaydens / were
corrumpid and they took them away with hem / And also ye ought to know that
they ought to entende diligently to the cures of the enfermytees in cyrugerye /
They ought to make their playsters acordynge to the wounds or sores / if the
wound be round The enplastre must be round / and if hit be long / hit must
be long / and otherwhile hit must be cured by his contrary / like as hit
apperteyneth to phisique / For the hete is cured by cold / and the cold by
hete / and Joy by sorrow / and sorrow by Joy / and hit happeth often times
that much people be in great paryll in taking to much Joy and lose her
membris / and become half benomen in the sodayn Joy / And Joy is a replection
of thing that is delectable sprad a broad in all the membris with right great
gladness And all men entende and desire to have the said right great Joy
naturelly / But they know not what may ensue and come thereof And this Joy
comes otherwhile of virtue of conscience / And the wise man is not with out
this Joy And this Joy is never Interrupt ne in deffaulte at no time For hit
comes of nature And fortune may not take a way that nature gives. And
merciall says that Joys fugitives abide not long But flee away ano^n And
valerian reherceth that he that has force and strength raysonable / has hit
of verray matier of complexion and that comes of love And this Joy has as
much power to depart the soul fro the body / as has the thondre / whereof
hit happend that there was a woman named lyna which had her husbonde in the
war in the shipp is of the romans / And she supposid verily that he was ded
/ But hit happend that he came again home And as he entryd in to his yate / his
wif met with him so deynly not warned of his coming. which was so glad and
Joyous / that in enbrasynge him she fill down ded Also of an other woman to
whom was reportid by a falls messanger that her sone was ded / which w^^te home
soroufully to her hows / And afterward when her sone came to her / As soon as
she saw him / she was so esmoued with Joy yt she deyde to fore him / But this
is not so great meruaylle of women as is of the men / For the women ben likened
unto soft wax or soft air and therefore she is callid mulier which Is as
much to say in latin as mollys aer. And in english soyfte air / And hit
happeth often times that the nature of them that been soft and mole / takes
sonner Inpression than the nature of men that is rude and strong / Valerye
reherceth a says that a knight of rome named I^staulosus that had newly
conquerid and subiuged the isle of Corsika / And as he sacrefyed his gods / he
receyuyd lettres from the senate of rome In which were contained dyuerce
supplicacyons / The which when he vnd^rstood he was so glad and so enterprysed
with Joy that he knew not what to do And than a great fu^^ce or smoke issued
out of the fire In which he dispayred and fill in to the fire / where he was
anon ded / And also it is said that Philomenus lawhed so sore and
distemperatly that he deyde all lawhynge / And we read that ^pocras the
phisicien fond remedy for this Joy / For when he had long dwelled out of
his contreye for to learn conning and wysedom / And should return unto his
parentis and friends / when he approchid nyghe them / He sent a messanger to
fore for to tell to them his coming / and commanded him to say that he came
for they had not long to fore seen him And yt they should attempre them in that
Joy er they should see him / And also we read that Titus the sone of vaspasian
when he had conquered Iherusalem and abode in ye contrees by he herd yt his
fader vaspasian was chosen by all the senate for to govern the empire of rome
/ wherefore he had so right great Joy that suddenly he lost the strength of
all his members And he came all Impotent And when Josephus that made the
historye of the romans against the Iewis / which was a right wise phisicien
saw and knew the cause of this sekenes of the said Titus / he inquired of his
folk if he had in hate any man greatly so much that he might not here speak of
him ner well see him And one of the servants of Titus said that he had one
person in ha^^ so much. That there was no man in his court so hardy that
durst name him in his presence / and than Josephus assigned a day when this
man should come / and ordained a table to set in ye sight of Titus / and did
hit to be replenysshid plenteuously with all dayntees / and ordained men to be
armed to keep him in such wise that no man should hurt him by the commandment
of Titus / and ordained boutellers. Coques / and other officers for to serve
him worshipfully like an Empour / and when all this was ready / Josephus brought
in this man that tytus hated and set him at the table to fore his eyes and
was served of young men with great reverence right cortoisly / And when titus
beheld his enemy set to fore him with so great honor / He began to chauffe
him self by great felonnye And commanded his men that this man should be slain /
And when he saw / that none would obey him But that they allway served him
reverently / he wax so ardante / and enbrasid with so great ire / that he that
had lost all the force and strength of his body and was all Impotent in all
his members / Recoured the health again and strenghte of his membris / by the
hete that entryd in to the veins and finewis And Josephus did so much that
he was recouerid and hole / And that he held that man no more for his enemy /
but held him for a verray true friend / And afterward made him his loyal
felawe and compaignon And the espicers and Apotecayres ought to make truly
such things as Is commanded to them by the physicyens / And they ought
^accomplisshe their billis and charge curyously with great disygence / that for
none other cause they should be ocupied but in making medicynes or confections
truly. And that they ought upon paryll of their sou^le not to forgete / by
negligence ne rechelesnes to give one medecyne for an other / In such wise
that they be not s^ears of men / And that they do put no false things In her
spyces for to empayre or encrecynge the weight. For if they so do they may
better be called theuys than espicers or apotecayris / And they that been
acustomed to make oynements they ought to make hit proprely of true stuf and of
good odoure after the receptes of the ancient doctors / And after the form
that the phisicyens and cyrurgyens deuyse unto them / Also they ought to beware
that for none avail ne gift that they might have / that they put in their
medicynes no thing venomous ner doing hurt or scathe to any person of whom
they have none good ne very knowledge / to the end that they to whom the
medicynes should be given / torn not to them hurt ne damage / ne in
destructions of their neighbors / and also that they that have mynystrid tho
thyngis to them / ben not taken for parteners of the blame and of the sin of
them The cyrurgyens ought also to be debonayr. amyable. and to have pytye of
their pacyents. And also they ought not be hasty to launse and cut apostumes
and soores / ne open the heedes / ner to arrache bones broken / but if the
cause be apparent / For they might else lose their good renome And might
better be called bouchers than helars or guarisshors of wounds and soores And
also hit behooves that all this manner of people foresaid that have the charge
for to make hole and guarisshe all manner of maladyes and Infirmitees that they
first have the cure of them self / and they ought to purge them self fro all
apostumes and all vices / In such wise that they be net and honest and
informed in all good manners / And that they show hem hole and pure and ready
for to hele other And hereof says Boecius de Consolacione In his first book
that the sterres that been hid under the clouds may give no light. And
therefore if any man wole behold clerly the write. Late him wythdrawe him fro
the obscurete and derkenes of the clouds of ignorance / for when the engyne of
a man shows in Joy or in sorrow / The pensee or thought is enuoluped in
obscurete and under the clouds.

The sixthe chapitre of the third book treteth of the sixth pawn / which is
lykened to tauerners hostelers and vitayllers.
THe sixthe pawn which stands to fore the Alphyn on the lift side is made
in this form. For hit is a man that has the right hand stracched out as for
to call men / And holds in his lift hand a loof of breed and a cup of
wyn / And on his gurdell hanging a boudest of keys / And this resembles the
Tauerners. hostelers. and sellars of vitaylle. And thise ought proprely to be
set to fore the / Alphyn as to fore a Judge For there sourdeth often times
among hem contencion noise and stryf / which behooves to be determined and
trayted by the alphyn / which is Judge of the king / And hit apperteyneth to
them for to seek and inquire for good wyns and good vitayll for to give and
selle to the buyers / And to them that they herberowe / And hit apperteyneth to
them well to keep their herberowes and I^mes / and all tho thyngis that they
bring in to their loggynge and for to put hit in seure and sauf ward and
keeping / And the first of them Is signefyed by the lift hand in which he
bears bread and wyn / and the second is signefied by the right hand which
Is strac^hed out to call men / And the third is representid by the keys
hanging on ye gurdell And these manner of people ought teschewe the sin of
glotonye / For much people comen in to their howses for to drink and to ete
for which cause they ought resonably to rewle them self and to refrain them
from to much mete and drink / to the end that they might the more honestly
delyuere thyngis needful unto the people that come unto them / And no thing by
oustrage that might noye the body / For hit happeth often times that there comes
of glotonye tencyons. stryfs. ryottes. wrongs. and molestacyons / by which
men lose other while their hands. their eyes. and other of their members / And
sometime ben slain or hurt unto the death / As it is wreton In vitas patrum As on
a time an heremyte went for to visit his gossibs / And the devil apperyd to
him on the way in lykenes of an other heremyte for to tempte him / and said
thou have left thyn heremitage And ghost to visyte thy gossibs / The behooves
by force to do one of ye three things that I shall say to the / thou shall
chese whether thou wylt be drunk / or else have to do flessly with thy gossib
or else thou shall s^e her husbond which is thy gossip also / And the hermyte
that thought for to chese the left evil chase for to be drunk / and when he
came unto them he drank so much that he was very drunk And when he was
drunk and eschauffed with the wyn / he would have a do with his gossib / And
her husbonde wythstode him. And than the hermyte slew him / And after that
say by his gossib and knew her flessly / And thus by this sin of
dronkenship he accomplisshid the two other sins / By which thing ye may
understand and know yt when the devil will take one of the castellis of
Ihesu christ / that is to wete the body of a man or of a woman / he does as a
prince that sets a ^iege to fore a castle that he would win / which
ente^deth to win the gate / For he knows well when he has won the gate /
he may sone do his will with the castle. And in like wise does the devil
with every man and woman. For when he has won the gate / that is to wete the
gate of ye mouth by glotonye or by other sin He may do with the offices of
the body all his will as ye have herd to fore / And therefore ought every man
ete and drink so brely in such wise as he may live. And not live to ete
glotonsly a for to drink drunk* ye see comunly that a great bole is suffisid
with right a lityll pasture / And that a wode suffiseth to many olefauntes And
hit behooves a man to be fed by the earth or by the sea / nevertheless it is
no great thing to feed the belly / no thing so great as is the desire of many
metes Whereof Quyntylian says / That hit happeth often times in great festes and
dyners / that we be fylde with the sight of the noble and lichorous metis and
when we would ete we ben saciat and filled / And therefore hit is said in proverb
/ hit is better to fylle the belly than the eye / And lucan says that glotonye
is the mother of all vices / and especial of lecherye / and also is destroyer
of all goods And may not have suffisance of lityll thing / A covetous honger
what sekest thou mete and vitayllis on the land and in the sea / And thy Joy
is nothing ellis but to have playnte^ous disshes and well fylde at thy table
learn how men may demene his life with lityll thing / And Cathon says in no
wise obey to glotonye which is friend to lecherye / And the holy doctor
saint Augustyn says / the wyn eschauffeth the belly that falls anon, to
lecherye / The belly and the membrers engendreurs ben neyghebours to lecherye /
And thus the vice of glotonye provoke lecherye / whereof comes forgetenes of
his mind and destruction of all quyk and sharp reason And is cause of
distempance of his wits / what sin is fowler than this sin and more
stynkynge ne more domageous. For this sin has taken away the virtue of the
man / his prowess languisshed / his virtue is turned to diffame / the
strength of body and of courage is turned by the / And therefore says Ba^lle le
grant / late us take heed how we serve the belly and the throat by glotonye like
as we were dombe bestes / and we study for to be like unto belues of the sea /
to whom nature has given to be alleway inclined toward the earth and there to
look for to serve their belyes / And hereof says Boecius de consolacione in his
fourth book / that a man that lyuyth and does not the conditions of a man / may
never be in good condition / Than must hit needs be that he be transported in
nature of a best or of a belue of the sea. How well that right great men and
women full of meruayllous sciences and noble counceyll in thise days in the
world ben kept and nourisshid in this glotonye of wyns and metes / and often
times ben ouerseen / how suppose ye / is hit not right a perilous thing that
a lord or governor of the people and co^mun well / how well that he be wise /
if he eschauffe him sone so that ye wyn or other drink surpryse him and
overcome his brayn. his wysedom is lofte / For as Cathon says / Ire enpessheth
the courage in such as he may not keep verite and truth And anon as he is
chauffed / lecherye is meuyd in him in such wise that the lecherye makes him
to meddle in diverse villayns deeds / For than his wysedom is a sleep and goon /
And therefore says Ouide in his book De remedio amoris / if thou take many and
dyuerce wyns / they apparylle and enforce the corages to lecherye And Thobie
witnessith in his book / that luxurye destroys the body / and mynussheth
richesses / she loses the soul / she febleth ye strength she blyndeth the
sight / and makes the wys hoos a raw / Ha A right evil and foul sin of
dronkenship / by the perissheth virginite / which is suster of angellis
possedynge all goodness and seurte of all Joys pardurable / Noe was one time
so chauffed with wyn / that he discouerd and shewid to his sons his preuy
members in such wise as one of his sons mocqued him / And that other couerd
hem / And loath which was a man right chaste. was so alloted by much drinking
of wyn / that on a montayne he knew his daughters carnelly / And had to do
with them as they had been his propre wives. And crete reherceth that boece
which was flour of the men / tresor of rychesses / singular house of sapience
myrour of the world / Odor of good renome / and glory of his subgettis lost
all these things by his luxurye We have seen that dyuerce that were Joined by
great amyte to geder whiles they were sobre / that that one / would put his
body in paryll of death for that other / and when they were eschauffed with wyn
and drunk / they have run each upon other for to sle hem / And sum have been that have slain so his friend / Herodes Antipas had not done saint John
baptist to ben beheded / ne had ye dinner ben full of glotonye and dronkenship /
Balthazar king of babilone had not ben chaced out of his kingdom ne be slain
if he had been sobre among his people whom tyrus and dares fond dronken and
slew him The hostelers ought to be well bespoken and courtoys of words to
them that they receive in to their loggynge For fair speech and Joyous chiere
and debonayr / cause men to give the hostelyer a good name / And therefore it is
said in a common proverb / Courtoyse langage and well saying is much worth and
cost lityll^ / And in an other place it is said that curtoysie passes beaulte
/ Also for as much as many paryls and adventures may happen on the ways and
passages to hem that been herberowed with in their Innes / therefore they ought
to accompanye them when they depart and enseigne them the ways and tell to
them the paryls / to the end that they may surely goo their viage and Journey /
And also they ought to keep their bodies. their goods / And the good fame and
renomee of their Innes / we read that loath when he had receyuyd ye angels in to
his house right debonairly which he had supposid had been mortal men and
strangers / to the end that they should eskape the disordinate and vnnaturell
sin of lecherye of the soda^^tes / by the virtue of good faith / he set a
part the naturell love of a fader / and proferd to them his daughters which
were virgyns to the end that they should keep them and defend them fro that
vyllayne and horrible sin / And know ye for certain that all tho things
that been taken and delyueryd to keep to the host or hostesses they ought to be
sauf and yelden again with out a payringe For the ooste ought to know / who
that entryth in to his house for to be her berowhed takes hit for his
habitacion for the time / he him self and all such things as he brings
with him ben co^mysed of right in the ward and keeping of the host or
hosteler And ought to be as sauf as they were put in his owen propre house And
also such hoostis ought to hold servants in their houses which should be
true and wyt^ out avarice In such wise that they coueyte not to have the
goods of their ghestes And that they take not a way the prouender fro their
horses when hit is given to them / that by thoccasion thereof their horsis
perisshe not ne faylle their master when they have need / and might fall in
the hands of their enemies / For than should the servants because of that
evil / wherefore their masters should see to For with out doubt this thing
is worse than theft Hit happend on a time in the parties of lomberdye in the
cite of Iene yt a noble man was logged in an hostelerye with much compaignye /
And when they had given prouendour to their horses / In the first our of the
night. the servant of the house came secretly to fore ye horses for to stele away
their prouender / And when he came to the lords horse / The horse caught with his
teth his Arm and held hit fast that he might not escape / And when the thief
saw that he was so strongly holden / he began to cry for the great pain that
he suffryd and felt / In such wise that the noble man's meyne came with the
hooste / But in no manner / ner for ought they could do They could not take the
thief out of the horses mouth unto the time that the neighbors which were
noyed with the noise came and saw hit / And than the thief was known and taken
and brought to fore the Judge And confessid the feet and by sentence diffinytyf
was hanged and lost his life / And in the same wise was an other that did so /
And the horse smote him in the visage / That the prynte of the horse shoo and
nails abode ever in his visage / Another caas right cruel and villaynous
fylle at toulouse / Hit happend a Ionge man and his fader went a pilgremage to
saint James in Galyce And were logged in an hostelrye of an evil host and
full of right great couetyse / In so much that he desired and coueyted the
goods of the two pilgrims And here upon auysed him and put a cup of silver
secretly in the male that the young man bare / And when they departed out of
their loggynge / he followed after hem and said to fore the people of the court
that they had stolen and born away his cup / And the young man excused him
self and his fader / And said they were Innocen^ of that caas / And than they
serchid hem and the cup was founden in ye male of the young man And forthwyth
he was dampened to the death and hanged as a thief / and this feet done all the
goods that langed to the pilgrym were deliuerid to ye oost as co^fisqued And
than the fader went for to do his pilgremage / and when he came again he must
needs come and pass by the place where his sone henge on the gibet And as he
came he complaygned to god and to saint James how they might suffer this
adventure to come unto his sone / Anon his sone that henge spack to his fader
And said how that saint James had kept him with out harm And bad his fader
goo to the Judge and show to him the miracle / And how he was Innocent of that
fayte / And when this thing was known the sone of the pilgryme was taken down
fro ye gibet / and the cause was brought to fore the Judge And the hooste was
accused of the trayson / and he confessid his trespaas / and said he did hit
for couetyse to have his good And than the Judge dampened him for to be hanged on
the same gibet where as the young pilgryme was hanged And that I have said of
the servants being men / the same I say of the women as chambriers and
tapsters For semblable caas fille in spain at saint down of a chamberier /
that put a cup in like wise in the scrippe of a pilgryme / be cause he would not
have a do with her in the sin of lecherye / wherefore he was hanged And his
fader and mother that were there with him went and did her pilgremage / And
when they came again they fond her sone living / And than they went and told
the Judge / which Judge said that he would not believe hit till a cok and an
hen which roasted on the fire were a live and the cok crewe. And anon they
began wexe a live and the cok crewe and began to crow and to pasture / and
when the Judge saw this miracle / he went and took down the sone / and made
the chamberyer to be taken and to be hanged / wherefore I say that the hoostes
ought to hold no tapsters ne chamberyers / but if they were good meure and
honest / For many harms may be fall and come by the disordenat rewle of
servants.

The seventh chapitre of the third Tractate treteth of kepars of towns
customers and toll gaderers etc.
THe gardes and kepars of of cytees ben signefied by the.vii. pawn which
stondeth in the lift side to fore the knight / And is formed in the semblance
of a man holding in his right hand great keys And in his lift hand a pot
and an elle for to mesure with And ought to have on his gurdell a purse open /
And by the keys ben signefyed the kepars of the cytees and towns and common
offices / And by the pot and elle ben signefyed them that have the charge to
weye and mete and mesure truly And by the purse ben signefied them that reseyue
the costumes. tolles. scawage. peages / and duetes of the cytees and towns And
these people ben set by right to fore the knight / And hit behooves that the
gardes and officers of the towns be taught And enseygned by the knights / And
that they know and inquire how ye cytees or towns ben governed / which
apperteyneth to be kept and defended by the knights. And first hit
apperteyneth that the kepars of the cite be dilygente. besy. clear seeing and
lovers of the common prouffit and well as well in the time of pees as in the
time of war / They ought alleway to goo in the cite and inquire of all
things and ought rapporte to the governors of the cite such thing as they
find and know And such thing as apperteyneth and to the seuerte of the same
/ and to deno^nce and tell the defaultes and paryls that there be / And if hit
be in time of war they ought not to open the yates by night to no man / And
such men as ben put in this office / ought to be of good renome and fame.
true. and of good conscience / In such manner that they love them of the Cite
or town / And that they put to no man any blame or vilanye with out cause by
envy. Couetyse ne by hate / but they ought to be sorry and heavy when they see
that any man should be complained on for any cause For h^t happeth often times
that diuerce officers accuse the good people fraudulently / To the end that they
might have a thank and be preysed and to abide stille in their offices And
trewly hit is a great and hye manner of malice to be in will to do evil and
diffame other with out cause to get glory to him self Also the kepars and
officers of cytees ought to be such that they suffer no wrongs ne vylonyes to
fore the Iuges and governors of cytees with out cause to be done to them that been Innocents / but they ought to have their eyes and regard unto him / that
knows the hertes and thoughts of all men / And they ought to dread and
doubt him with out whose grace their wacche and keeping is naught And that
promyseth to them that doubt him shall be ewrous and happy / And by him ben
all things accomplisshid in good / Hit is founden in the historyes of rome
that Temperour Frederik the second did do make a gate of marble of
meruayllous work and entayll in the cite of capnane upon the watre that
renneth about the same / and upon this yate he made an image like him self
sittynge in his mageste / and two Iuges which were set / one on the right
side and that other on the lift side. And upon the sercle above the head of
the Judge on ye right side was wreton / All they enter seurly that will live
purely / And upon the sercle of the Judge on the lift side was wreton The
untrue man ought to doubt / to do thing that he be put to prison fore / and
on the sercle above them^our was wreton / I make them live in misery / that I
see live dismesurably / And therefore hit apperteyneth to a Judge to show to the
people for to dread and doubt to do evil / And hit apperteyneth to the gardes
and officers to doubt the Iuges and to do trewly their seruyces and offices
And hit apperteyneth to a prince to menace the traitors and the malefactors
of right grievous pains. And hereof we find in the ancient historyes of
cecylle that the king denis had a brother whom he louyd sore well / But allway
where he went he made heavy and tryste semblant / And thus a^ they went both
to gyder on a time in a chare / there came again hem two pour men with glad
visage but in foul habit And ye king anon as he saw them / sprange out of
his chare and resseyuyd them worshipfully with great reverence / wherefore his
barons were not only ameruaylled but also angry in their corages /
notwithstanding fere and dread let them to demand him the cause But they
made his brother to demand the cause and to know the certaynte / And when he
had herd his brother say to him the demand / and that he was blessed and also
a king which was rich and full of delites and worshipis / he demanded him if
he would assaye and know the grace and beneurte of a king And his brother
answered ye / And that he desired and required hit of him / and than the king
commanded unto all his sugettis that they should obey in all things only unto
his brother And than when the our of dinner came and all thing was ready / the
brother was set at the table of the king And when he saw that he was served
with right noble botelliers and other officers. And he herd the sownes of
musicque right melodious The king demanded him than / if he supposid yt he
were benerous and blessid. And he answered I wene well that I am right well
blessid and fortunat / and that I have well proved and feel and am expert
thereof And than the king secretly made to be hanged over his heed a sharp
cuttynge sword hanging by an horse here or a silken threde so small that no
man might see hit where by hit henge / and when he saw his brother put no more
his hand to the table / ne had no more regard unto his servants / he said to
him why ete ye not / ar ye not blessid / say if ye feel any thing otherwise
than blessid and well / And he answerde for as much as I see this sharp sword
hanging so subtly and parillously over my head I feel well that I am not
blessid for I dread that hit should fall on my he^e / and than discouerd the
king unto hem all wherefore he was allway so heavy cherid and triste For where
he was / he thought alleway on the sword of the secret vengeance of god /
which he beheld alleway in his heart / wherefore he had allway in him self
great dread And therefore he worshipid gladly the pour people with glad visage
and good conscience And by this shows the king well / that what man that is
allway in dread is not allway merry or blessid. And hereof says Quyntilian that
this dread surmounteth all other maleurtees and euyllys / For it is maleurte
of dread night and day / And it is verite that to him that Is doubtid of much
people / so must he doubt much / And that lord is less than his servants
that dredeth his servants / And truly hit Is a right sure thing to dread no
thing but god / And sumtyme right hardy men ben constrained to live in dread /
Dread causes a man to be curyous and besy to keep the things that been
commysed to him that they perisshe not / But to be to much hardy and to much
ferdfull / both two ben vices The common officers ought to be wise. discrete.
and well aduysed in such wise that they take not of ye people ne require no
more than they ought to have by reason / ne that they take of the sellars ne of
the byars no more than the right custom and toll / for they bear the name of a
co^mun person / and therefore ought they to show them common to all men / and
for as much as the byars and sellars have sometime much langage / they ought
to have with them these virtues / that is to wete patience and good courage with
honest for they that been despiteus to the co^mun / ben otherwhile had in
vilayns despite / therefore beware yt thou have no despite to the pour
mendicants / if thou will come and atteyne to thingis souerayn for the Iniurye
that is don with out cause / torneth to diffame him that does hit / A Iogheler
on a time beheld socrates and said to him / thou have the eyes of corrumpour of
children and art as a traytre. And when his disciples herd him / they would
auengid their master But he repreuyd hem by such sentence saying / Suffer my
felaws for I am he and such one as he says / by the sight of my visage / But
I refrain and keep me well from such thing / This same socrates him self was
chidde and right fowll spoken to of his wife / and she Imposid to him many great
Injuries with out nombre / and she was in a place a boue over his heed And when
she had brawlid Inowh / she made her watre and pourid hit on his heed And he
answered to here no thing again / sauf when he had dried and wypid his heed he
said / he knew well that after such wind and thonder should comen rayn and
watre And the philosophres blamed him that he could not govern two women /
that was his wife and his chambrere / And shewde him that one cokke governed
well.xv. hens He answered to them that he was so used and accustomed with
their chiding that the chydynges of them ne of estrangers did him no greef ne
harm / give thou place to him that brawleth or chydeth / and in suffrynge him
thou shall be his vaynquysshour / And Cathon says when thou lyuyst ryghtfully
recche the not of the words of evil people / And therefore it is said in a
common proverb / he that well does reccheth not who sees hit / and hit is not
in our power to let men to speak* And prosper says that to good men lacks
no goodness / her to evil men tencions stryfs and blames And patience is a
right noble virtue / as a noble versifier says That patience is a right noble
manner to vaynquysshe. For he that suffers ouercometh. And if thou wylt
vaynquysshe and overcome / learn to suffer / The peagers ner they that keep
passages ought not to take other peage ne passage money but such as the prince
or the law have establisshid / so that they be not more robbeurs of monoye
than reseyuours of peage and passage And hit apperteyneth to them to goo out of
the paryllous weyes and doubteuous for to keep their office and they ought to
Require their passage of them that owe to pay hit with out noynge and
contencion / And they ought not to love the common prouffyt so much / That they
fall in the hurtynge of their conscience / For that should be a manner of
robberye / And hereof says ysaye Woo to the that robbest / For thou thy self
shall be robbed / The gardes or porters of the gates of cytees and of the common
good ought to be good and honest. And all truth ought to be in them and
they ought not to take ne withdraw the goods of the common that they have in
keeping / more than apperteyneth to them for their pension or ^^ee So that they
that been made tresorers and kepars ben not named theuys / For who that takes
more than his He shall never thryue with all ner shall not enjoy hit long
For of evil gooten good the third he^r shall never rejoice / And this
suffisith etc.

This eygth chapitre of the third book trete^h of Rybauldis players of dyse
and of messagers and corrours
THe rybauldes. players of dyse And the messangers and corrours ought to be
set to fore the rook For hit apperteyneth to the rook which is vicayre and
lieutenant of the king to have men couenable for to run here and there for
tenquyre and epsy the place and cytees that might be contrary to the king /
And this pawn that represents this people ought to be formed in this manner he
must have the form of a man that has long heeris and black and holds in
his right hand a lityll monoye And in his lift hand three Dyse And about him
a co^de instead of a gyrdell / and ought to have a box fulle o lettres And by
the first / which is money is understand they that be fool large and wastours
of their goods / And by the second which is the dyse Ben represented the
players at dyse / Rybauldes and butters / And by the third which is the box
full of lettres ben representid the messagers. corrours / And berars of lettres
/ And ye shall understand that the roock which is vicaire of the king when
he sees to fore him such people as ben folelarge and wastours. He is bounden
to constitute and ordeyne upon them tutours and curatours to see that they ete
not ne waste in such manner their goods ne their heritages / that pouerte
constrayne hem not to stele / For he that of custom has had haboundance of
money and goth and dispendith hit folily and wastes hit away / when he comes
to pouerte and has naught / he must needs beg and are his breed. orellis he
must be a thief / For such manner of people / if they have been delicyous they
will not labor / for they have not learned hit And if they be noble and comen
of gentilmen / they be ashamed to axe and beg / And thus must they by force
when they have wasted their propre goods if they will live they must stele
and rob the goods of other And ye shall understand that folelarge is a
right evil vice / for how well that she does good and prouffit sometime to
other yet she does harm and damage to him that so wastes. Cassiodore
admonesteth the fool larges to keep their things / that by no necessite they
fall in pouerte / And that they be not constrained to beg ne to stele of
other men For he says that hit is gretter subtilte to keep well his own
goods / than to find strange thing / and that it is gretter virtue to keep
that is gotten than to get and win more / and claudian says in like wise in
his book that hit is a gretter thing and better to keep that is gotten Than to
get more And therefore hit is said yt the pour demands and beggeth er he
felith / and also hit is said that he yt dispendith mo^e than he has / with
out struck he is smyten to the death / There was a noble man named John de
ganazath which was right rich / And this man had but two daughters whom he
married to two noble men / And when he had married them / he loved so well his
sons in law their husbondes / that in space and succession of time / he
departed to them all his goods temporell / And as long as he gaf to them
they obeyed him and were right diligent to plese and serve him so hit befell
that on a time that he had all given in so much that he had right naught /
Than hit happend that they to whom he had given his goods / which were wont
to be amyable and obeyssant to him as long as he gaf. When time came that he
was pour and knew that he had not they becam unkind Disagreable and
disobeyssant / And when the fader saw that he was deceyuyd by his debonayrte
and love of his daughters / He desired and coueyted sore teschewe his pouerte /
At last he went to a merchant that he knew of old time. And required him to
^ene to him.x. thousand pound for to pay and render again with in three days /
And he lent hit him / and when he had brought hit in to his how^ / Hit happend
that hit was a day of a solemn feste / on which day he gaf to his daughters
and her husbonde a right noble dinner / and after dinner he entrid in to his
chamber secretly with them / And drew out of a coffre that he had do make all
new shettynge with iii. lockis / the menoye that the merchant had lent him
And poured out upon a tapyte that his doughtres and their husbondes might see
hit / And when he had shewid hit unto them he put hit up again and put hit in
to the cheste faynynge that hit had been all his And when they were departed he
bare the money home to the merchant that he had borrowed hit of / And the next
day after his daughters and their husbondes Axid of him how much money was
in the cheste that was shette with.iii. lockis / And than he feigned and said
that he had therein.xxv. thousand pound / which he kept for to make his
testament and for to leave to his daughters and hem / if they would bear hem as
well to him ward as they did when they were married / And than when they herd
that / they were right Joyous and glad And they thought and concluded to serve
him honorably as well in clothing as in mete and drink and of all other
things necessary to him unto his end And after this when the end of him
began tapproche / he called his daughters and her husbondes and said to hem in
this ma^ere / ye shall understand that the money that is in the chest shette
under.iii. locks I will leave to you Sanynge I will that ye give in my
presence er I dye whilis I live to the friar prechours.C. pound and to the
friar menours.C. pound / And to the heremytes of saint Augustyn.l. pound to
the end that when I am buried and put in the earth ye may demand of them the
keys of ye cheste where my tresour is Iime / which keys they keep / and I
have put on each keye a bille and writynge In witnessinge of the things above
said / And also ye shall understand that he did do to be given whilis he lay
in his death bed to each church and recluse and to your people a certain
quantyte of money by the hands of his daughters husbondes / which they did
gladly. In hope to have shortly the money that they supposid had been in the
cheste / And when hit came to the last day / that he deyde / He was born to
church and his exequye don and was buried solempnly / And the eygth day the
seruyse worshipfully accomplisshid / They went for to demand the keys of the
Religious men that they had kept / which were deliueryd to them / And than
they went and opend the coffre where they supposid the money had been I^^^ /
And there they fond no thing but a great clubbe / And on the the handlynge was
wreton / I John of canazath make this testament / that he be slain with this
clubbe / that leuyth his owen prouffit. And gyuyth hit to other / as who says
hit is no wysedom for a man to give his good to his children and keep none for
him self / And ye shall understand that it is a great folly to dispende and
waste his good / In hope for to recoure hit of other be hit of sone or daughter
or right nyghe kyn / For aman ought to keep in his hand in dispendynge his
owen goods / to fore he see that he dyspende other mennys / And he ought not
to be holden for a good man / That has lityll renome and spends many thyngys
/ And I trow that such persons would gladly make noueltees as for to noye and
grieve seignories and meue wars and tencions against them that habounde in
rychesses and goods / And also make extorcyons clamours and trybulacyons
against their lords to the end to waste the goods of the people. like as they
have wasted theyris And such a wastour of goods may never be good for the
common prouffit. And ye shall understand that after these wastours of goods we
say that the pleyars of dyse and they that use bordellis ben worst of all
other For when the hete of playnge at the dyse / And the couetyse of their
stynkynge lecherye has brought hem to pouerte / hit follows by force that
they must ben theuys and robbeurs And also dronkenship. glotonye. And all
manner of euyllis follow them and myschief / And they follow gladly the
companyes of knights and of noble men when they goon unto the war or
batayllis And they coueyte not so much the victory as they do the robbery
And they do much harm as they goo And they bring lityll gayn or winning /
whereof hit happend on a time that saint bernard rode on an horse about in the
country And met with an hasardour or dyseplayer / which said to him / th^n
gods man will thou play at dyse with me thyn horse against my soul / to whom
saint Bernard answered / if thou will oblige thy soul to me against my horse / I
wolle a light down and play with the / and if thou have mo points than I on
three dyse I promise the thou shall have mine horse / And than he was glad / and
ano^n cast.iii. dyse / And on each dyse was a syse / which made.xviii. points
And anon he took the horse by the brydell / as he that was sewr that he had
won / and said that the horse was his And than saint Bernard said abide my
sone For there ben mo points on the dyse than.xviii. And than he cast the dyse
/ In such wise that one of the.iii. dyse clefte a sonder in the mids / And
on that one part was syse and on that other an Aas / And each of that other
was a syse / And than Saint Bernard said That he had won his soul for as
much as he had cast on three dyse.xix. points / And than when this player saw
and apperceyuyd this miracle / He gaf his soul to saint Bernard and be came a
monk and finysshid his life in good works / The corrours and berars of lettres
ought hastily and spedily do her viage that is commanded hem / with out
taryenge / For their taryenge might noye and grieve them that send hem forth /
or ellis them to whom they ben sent too / And torn hem to right great damage
or villonye / for which cause every noble man ought well to take heed to whom
he deliuere his lettres and his mandements / and otherwhilis such people ben
Ioghelers and dronkelewe / And goon out of their way for to see abbayes and
noble men for to have auantage And hit happeth often times / that when such
messagers or currours ben enpesshid by any taryenge / That other currours bear
lettres contrary to his / And come to fore him of which things often times
comes many things discouenable of loss of friends of castellys and of land
and many other things as in the feet of merchandise etc. And otherwhile hit
happeth that a prince for the fault of such messangers leseth to have
victory upon his enemies / And also there ben some that when they come In a
cite where they have not ben to fore / that been more besy to visyte the Cite
and the noble men that dwell theryn / Than they ben to do their wyage /
which* thing they ought not to do / But if they had special charge of them
that sent hem forth so to do. And also when they be sent forth of any lords
or merchants they ought to be well ware / that they charge hem not with over
much mete on morenynges ne with to much wyn on evenings / whereby her synewis
and veins might be greuyd / that they must for fault of good rewle tarry But
they ought to goo and come hastily for to report to their maistres answers as
hit apperteyneth And this suffisen of the things above said.

The fourth tractate and the last of the progression and draughtes of the
foresaid play of the chesse.
The first chapitre of the fourth tractate of the chesse board in genere how it
is made.
E have devised above the things that apperteyne unto the forms of the chesse
men and of their offices / that is to wete as well of noble men as of the common
people / than hit apperteyneth that we should deuyse shortly how they issue and
goon out of the places where they be set / And first we ought to speak of
the form and of the facion of the chequer after that hit represents and was
made after / For hit was made after the form of the cite of Babyloyne / In the
which this same play was founden as hit is said before / And four things The
first is / where ye shall understand that ye ought to consydere here in fore
that.lxiiii. points ben set in the eschequer which ben all square / The
second is wherefore the bordeur about his hyher than the squarenes of the
points / The third is wherefore the common people ben set to fore the nobles /
The fourth wherefore the nobles and the peples ben set in their propre places
There ben as many points in ye eschequer wide as full And ye shall first
understand wherefore that there ben lxiiii. points in the eschequyer / For as
the blessid saint Iherome says / the cite of babilone was right great and was
made all square / and in every quarter was.xvi. mile by nombre and mesure /
the which nombre four times told was.lxiiii. miles / After the manner of
lombardye they be callid miles / and in france leukes / and in englong they be
callid mylis also / And for to represente the mesure of this cite / In which
this play or game was founden / The philosopher that fond hit first ordained
a tablier conteynyng.lxiiii. points square / the which ben comprised with in
the bordour of the tablier / there ben xxxii. on that on side and.xxxii. on that
other which ben ordained for the beaulte of the play / and for to show the
manner and drawing of the chesse as hit shall appear in the chapitres following
/ and as to the second / wherefore ye bordour of the schequyer is hyher than
the table with in. hit is to be understand yt the bordour about represents
the wall of ye cite / which is right high / And therefore made ye philosopher
the bordour more high than ye tablier And as ye blessid saint Iherome says
upon ye prophecy of ysaye / that is to wete upon a montayne of obscurete.
which words were said of babilone which stands in chaldee / and nothing
of that babilone that stondeth in egipte / for it is so yt babilone which
stands in chaldee was set in a right great plain / and had so high walls
that by the heyghte of them / was contynuell derkenes environed and obscurete /
that none erthely man might behold and see the end of ye hyghnes of the wall
/ And therefore ysaye callid hit ye montaigne obscure / And saint Iherome says
yt the mesure of the heyght of this wall was three thousand paas / which
extends unto ye length of three mile lombardes / hit is to wete that lombarde
mylis and english miles ben of one length And in one of the corners of this
cite was made a toure treangle as a shield whereof the heyght extended unto the
length of.vii. thousand paas / which is.vii. mile english And this towr was
called the tour of Babell / The walls about the tour made a woman whose name
was semiranus as says virgilius / As to the third wherefore the common people
ben set to fore the nobles in the field of the bataylle in one renge First
for as much as they ben necessary to all nobles For the rooke which
stands on the right side and is vicaire of the king what may he do if the
labourer were not set to fore him and labourid to mynystre to him such
temporell things as be necessary for him / And what may the knight do if he
ne had to fore him the smyth for to forge his armours. sadellis. axis and
spores and such things as apperteyneth to him / And what is a knight worth
with out horse and arms / certainly nothing more than on of the people or
less perauenture And in what manner should the nobles live if no man made cloth
and bought and sold marchandyse / And what should kings and queen's and the
other lords do if they had no phisicyens ne cyrurgiens / than I say that the
people ben the glory of the Crown And sustain. the life of the nobles And
therefore thou that art a lord or a noble man or knight / despise not the common
people for as much as they ben set to fore the in ye play The second cause
is why the people ben set to fore the nobles and have the table wide to fore
them / is be cause they begin the bataylle / They ought to take heed and
entende to do their offices and their crafts / In such wise that they suffer
the noble men to govern the cytees and to counceylle and make ordenances of
the people of the battle how should a labourer a plowman or a craftyman
counceylle and make ordenance of such things as he never learned / And wot ne
knows the matter upon what thing the counceylle ought to be taken / Certes
the common people ought not to entende to none other thing but for to do their
seruyse and the office which is couenable unto hem / And hit apperteyneth not
to hem to be of counceyllys ne at the aduocacions / ne to menace ne to threte
noman / for often times by menaces and by force good counceylle is distroublid /
And where good counceyll faylleth / there often times the cytees ben betrayed
and destroyed / And Plato says That the common things and the cytees ben
blessid when they ben governed by wise men / or when the governors study in
wisdom / And so hit apperteyneth to the common to learn to vttre the matters and
the manner of procuracion to fore they be counceyllours / For hit happeth
oftetymes that he that makes him wyser that he understands is made more
fool than he is / And the fourth cause wherefore yt there ben in the tab^er as
many points wide as ben full. hit is to wete for that they what ever they be
that have people to govern / ought ten force to have cytees and castellis and
possessions for to set his people theryn / And for to labor and do their
ocupacion / For for to have the name of a king with out royame is a name wide
/ and honor with out prouffit / And all noblesse with out good manners / and
with out such things as noblesse may be mayntenyd / ought better be callid
folly than noblesse. And shameful pouerte is the more grievous when hit comes
by nature of an hyhe and noble burth or house. For noman gladly wole repreue a
pour man of the common people / But every man has in despite a noble man that
is pour if he have not in him good manners and virtuous / by which his pouerte
is forgoten / and truly a royame with out haboundance of goods by which hit
may be governed and prospere / may better be called a latrocynye or a nest of
theeuys than a royame / Alas what haboundance was some times in the royames.
And what prospite / In which was Justice / And every man in his office
content / how stood the cytees that time in worship and renome / how was
renomed the noble royame of England All the world dredde hit And spack worship
of hit / how hit now stands and in what haboundance I report me to them that
know hit if there ben theeuis with in the royame or on the sea / they know
that labor in the royame And sail on the sea I wot well the fame is great
thereof I pray god save that noble royame And send good true and politicque
counceyllours to the governors of the same etc / And noblesse of lignage with
out puyssance and might is but vanyte and dispite. And hit is so as we have
said to fore that the schequer which the philosopher ordained represented and
figured the said cite of Babilone And in like wise may hit figure a royame and
signefye al^ the w^rld And if men regard and take heed unto the points unto
the mids of every quadrante and so to double every quadrant to other the
miles of this cite all way doublinge unto the nombre of.lxiiii. The nombre of
the same should surmounte all the world / And not only the world but many
worlds by the doublinge of inylis / which doublinge so as a fore is said
should surmounte all things / And thus ends the first chapitre of the fourth
book.

The second chapitre of the fourth tractate treteth of the draught of the
king / And how he meuyth him in the chequer.
WE ought to know that in this world / the kings seygnourye and regne each in
his royame. And in this play we ought to know by the nature of hit how the
king meueth him and yssueth out of his place / For ye shall understand that
he is set in the fourth quadrante or point of theschequer. And when he is
black / he stands in the white / and the knight on his right side in white /
And the Alphyn and the rooke in black / And on the lift side the four holden
the places opposite / And the rayson may be such / For be cause that the
knights ben the glory and the crown of the king / They ensiewe in semblable
residence / that they do when they ben set semblably on the right side of
the king and on the lift side of the queen / And for as much as the rook on
the right side is vicayre of the king he accompanyeth the queen in semblable
siege that the Alphyn does which is Judge of the king / And in like wise the
lift rook and the lift Alphyn accompanye the king in semblable siege / In
such wise as they ben set about the king in both sides with the Queen in
manner of a crown / That they may seurely keep the royame that reluyseth and
shyneth in the king and in the Queen / In such wise as they may conferme and
diffende him in their sieges and in their places. And the more hastily run
upon his enemies And for as much as the Judge. the knight / and the vicaire.
keep and garnysshe the king on that one side / They that been set on the
other side keep the Queen / And thus keep they all the strength and fermete of
the royame / And semblably otherwhile for to ordeyne the things that
apperteyne to the counceyll / and to the besoyngne of the royame / For if each
man should entende to his owen proper things / And yt they defended not ner
took head unto the thingis yt apperteynen to the king to the common and to the
royame / the royalme should ano^n be divided in parties And thus might the Judge
regne / And the name of the dignyte royal should be lost / And truly for as
much as the king holds the dignyte above all other and the seygnourye
royal / therefore hit apperteyneth not that he absente him long / ne wythdrawe
him far by space of time from the master siege of his royame / For when he
well meue him / he ought not to pass at the first draught the nombre of.iii.
points / And when he begins thus to meue from his whyt point / he has the
nature of the rooks of the right side and of the lift side for to goo black or
whithe / And also he may goo unto the white point where the gardes of the Cite
ben set And in this point he has the nature of a knight. And these two
manners of meuynge apperteyneth other while to the queen / and for as much as
the king and the queen that been conjoined to geder by marriage ben one thing
as one flessh and blood / therefore may the king meue on the lift side of his
propre point also well as he were set in the place of the queen which is
black / and when he goth right in manner of the rook only / And hit happen that
the adversary be not covered in any point in the second ligne / The king may
not pass from his black point unto the third ligne / And thus he sortisith
the nature of the rook on the right side and lift side unto the place of the
knights and for to goo right to fore In to the white point to fore the
merchant / And the king also sortyst the nature of the knights when he goth
on the right side in two manners / For he may put him in the wide space to fore
the phisicyen / And in the black space to fore the tauerner / And on the other
side he goth in to other two places in lyk wise that is to fore the smyth / and
the notarye / And thus as in going out first in to.iiii. points he sorteth the
nature of knights and also the king sortiseth the nature of the alphins at
his first yssu in to.ii. places And he may goo on both sides unto the white
place wide / that one to fore y^ smith on that on side / and that other ^o for
the tauerner on that other side All these yssues has ye king out of his propre
place of his owen virtue when he begins to meue. But when he i^ ones meuyd
fro his propre place ^ He may not me^e but in to one space or point and so from
one to an other / And than he sortiseth the nature of the common people / and
thus by good right he has in him self the nature of all / For all the virtue
that is in the members comes of the heed and all me^yng of the body / The
beginning and life comen from the heart ^ And all the dignyte that the
subgettes have by execucion and contynuell appearance of their meuynge and issue
The king deteyneth hit and is attrib^ed to him / the victory of the knights
/ the prudence of ye Iuges / the auctorite of the vicaires or legates The
co^tynence of the queen the co^corde and unity of ye people Ben not all thise
things ascribed unto the honor and worship of the king In his issue when he
meuyd first The third ligne to fore the people he never excedeth / Fro in
the.iii. nombre all manner of states begin to meue For the trynary nombre
conteyneth.iii. parties / which make a perfect nombre / For a trynarye nombre
has.i.ii.iii. Which Joined to geder maken.vi. Which is the first parfyt
nombre And signefieth in this place / vi. persons named that constitute the
perfection of a royame That is to wete the king. the queen. Iuges. knights.
the vicaires or legates / and the common people And therefore the king ought to
begin in his first menynge of.iii. points / that he show perfection of life
as well in him self as in other After that the king begins to me^e he may
led with him the queen / after the manner of his issue For why the queen
follows unto two angularye places / after the manner of the alphyn / and to a
place indirect in the manner of a rook in to the black point to fore the
phisicien / herin is signefied that the women may not meue neither make vows
of pylgremage ner of viage without the will of their husbondes / For if a
woman had a vowed any thing / her husbonde living / and again saying / she
may not yield ne accomplisshe her vow / if the husbond will goo oughwer. he
may well goo with out her And if so be that the husbond will have her with him
/ she is bounden to follow him / And by reason For a man is the heed of a woman
/ and not econuerso / For as to such thingis as long to patrimony / they ben
like / but the man has power over her body / And so has not the woman over
his And therefore when the king begins to me^e. the Queen may follow / And
not alleway when she meuyd it is no need the king to meue / For why four the
first lignes be with in the limytes and space of the royame / And unto the
third point the king may meue at his first meuynge out of his propre place /
And when he passith the fourth ligne he goes out of his royame. And if he
pass oon point late him beware / For the person of a king Is acounted more
than a thousand of other / For when he exposes him unto the paryllis of
bataylle / Hit is necessary that he goo temperatly and slyly / For if he be
taken or ded / or ellis Inclusid and shette up / All the strengthes of all
other faylle and all Is fynysshid and lost / And therefore he has need to goo
and meue wisely / And also therefore he may not meue but one point after his
first meuynge but where that ever he goo foreward or bacward or on that one
side or that other or ellis cornerwyse / He may never approach his aduersarye
the king nerrer than in the third point / And therefore the kings in battle
ought never tapproche one nyghe that other / And also when the king has goon
so far that all his men be lost / than he is sole / And than he may not
endure long when he is brought to y^ extremyte / And also he ought to take heed that he stand not so that a knight or an other says chek rook / than
the king loses ye rook / That king is not well fortunat that leseth him to
whom his Auctoryte delegate apperteyneth / who may do the needs of the royame
if he be priuyd taken or deed / that was prouisour of all the royame / he
shall bear a sack on his head that Is shette in a cite / And all they that
were theryn ben taken in captivity and shette up etc.

The second chapter of the fourth book of the queen and how she yssueth out
of her place.
When the Queen which is accompanied unto the king begins to meue from her
propre place / She goth in dowble manner / that is to wete as an Alphyn when
she is black / she may goo on the right side and come in to the point to fore
the notayre And on the lift side in the black point and come to fore the
gardees of the cite And hit is to wete that she sortiseth in her self the
nature in.iii. manners first on the right side to fore the alphyn / Secondly on
the lift side where the knight is / And thirdly indirectly unto the black
point to fore the phisicyen And the rayson why. Is for as much as she has in
her self by grace / the auctorite that the rooks have by co^myscion / For she
may give and grant many things to her subgetts graciously And thus also
ought she to have parfyt wisdom ^ as the alphyns have which ben Iuges / as
hit said above in the chapitre of the Queen / And she has not the nature of
knights / And hit is not sittynge ne couenable thing for a woman to goo to
bataylle for the fragilite and feebleness of her / And therefore holds she not
the way in her draught as the knights done / And when she is meuyd ones out
of her place she may not goo but fro oon point to an other and yet cornerly
whether hit be foreward or backward taking or to be taken / And here may be
axid why the queen goth to the bataylle with the king / certainly it is for
the solace of him / and ostencion of love / And also the people desire to have
succession of the king And therefore the tartaris have their wives in to the
field with hem / yet hit is not good that men have their wyuys with hem / but
that they abide in the cytees or within their own terms / For when they ben
out of their cytees and limytes they ben not sure / but holden suspecte / they
should be shamfast and hold all men suspect / For dyna Jacobs daughter as long
as she was in the hows of her brethren / she kept her virginite / But as soon as
she went for to see the strange Regyons. Anon she was corrupt and defowled of
the sone of sichem / Seneca says that the women that have evil visages ben
gladly not chaste / but their courage desires gladly the company of men / And
Solynus says that no bestes femellys desire to be towched of their males when
they have conceyuyd / Except woman which ought to be a best Raysonable / And
in this caas she leseth her rayson / And Sidra^ wythnesseth the same And
therefore in the old law / the faders hadd dyuerce wives and An^^llys to
the end when one was with child they might take another* They ought to have the
visage enclyned for ^^schewe the sight of the men / that by the sight they be
not meuyd with Incontynence and diffame of other / And Ouyde says that there
ben some That how well that they eschew the deed / yet have they great Joy
when they ben prayed / And therefore ought the good women flee the curyosit^es
and places where they might f^^lle in blame and noise of the people.

The fourth chapitre of the fourth book Is of the yssuynge of the Alphyn.
THe manner and nature of the draught of the Alphyn is such / that he that is
black in his propre siege is set on the right side of the king / And he that
is whyt is set on the lift side / And ben called and named black and white /
But for no cause that they be so in substance of her propre color / But for
the color of the places in which they ben set / And alleway be they black
or white / when they ben set in their places / the alphyn on the right side /
going out of his place to the right sydeward comyth to fore the labourer /
And hit is reason that the Judge ought to deffende and keep the laborers and
possessions which ben in his Jurisdiction by all right and law / And also he
may goo on the lift side to the wide place to fore the phisicien / For like as
the phisiciens have the charge to hele the Infirmites of a man / In like wise
have the Iuges charge to appese all stryues and contencions and reduce unto
unity / And to punysshe and correct causes crymynels / The lift alphyn has
also two ways fro his owen place oon toward ye right side unto the black space
wide to fore the merchant / For the merchants need often times counceylle and
ben in debate of questions which must be determined by the Iuges / And that
other issue is unto the place to fore the rybauldis And that is be cause that
often times among them. fall noyses discencions theft and manslaghter /
wherefore they ought to be punysshid by the Iuges / And ye shall understand
that the alphyn goth alleway corner wise fro the third point to the third
point keeping allway his own siege / For if he be black / he goth allway black
/ And if he be white he goth alleway white. the issue or going cornerly or
angularly signefieth cautele or subtylyte / which Iuges ought to have /
The.iii. points betoken.iii. things that the Judge ought to attend / A Judge
ought to further rightful a true causes. secondly he ought to give true
counceyll / and thirdly he ought to give and Judge rightful sentences after tha
legeances / And never to goo fro the ryghtwisnes of the law / And it is to
wete that the Alphyn goth in six drawhtes all the tablier round about / and
that he comes again in to his owen place / And how be hit that all rayson and
good perfection should be in a king / yet ought hit also specially be in them
that been conceyllours of the king and the Queen And the king ought not to do
any thing doubtouse / till he have axid counceyll of his Iuges And of the
sages of the royame And therefore ought the Judge ^o be parfaytly wise and sage
as well in science as in good manners / And that is signefied when they mean
from three points in to three / For the sixth nombre by which they goo all
theschequer / And bring hem again in to her propre place in such wise that
the end of her moeuynge is comoyned again to the beginning of the place
frowhens they departed / And therefore hit is callid a parfayt moeuynge.

The fyfth chapitre of the fourth Tractate Is of the meuynge of the knights.
AFter the issue of the Alphyns we shall deuyse to you the issue and the
moeuynge of the knights / And we say that the knight on the right side is
whyt / And on the lift side black / And the issue and moeuynge of hem both is
in one manner when so is that the knight on the right side Is whyt / The lift
knight is black / The moeuynge of hem is such / That the white may goo in to
the space of the alphyn / as hit apperyth of the knight on the right side that
is white. And has three yssues fro his propre place / one on his right side in
the place to fore the labourer / And hit is well reason that when the labourer
and husbonde man has labored the feldes / the knights ought to keep them /
to thentent that they have vitailles for them self and their horses / The
second issue is that he may meue him unto the black space to fore the notarye
or draper. For he is bounden to deffende and keep them that make his
vestementis and couertours necessary unto his body. The third issue is that
he may go on the lift side in to the place to fore ye merchant which is set
to fore the king / the which is black / And the reason is for as much as he
ought and is holden to deffende the king as well as his owen person / when he
passith the first draught / he may goo four ways / And when he is in the
mids of the tabler he may goo in to.viii. places sundry / to which he may
run And in like wise may the lift knight goo which is black and goth out
of his place in to white / and in that manner goth the knight fighting by his
might / and grows and multiplieth in his poyntis / And often times by them the
field Is won or lost / A knyghts virtue and might is not known but by his
fighting / and in his fighting he does much harm for as much as his might
extends in to so many poyntis / they ben in many peryllis in their fighting
/ And when they escape they have the honor of the game And thus is hit of
every man the more vailliant / the more honored And he that meketh him self
often times shyneth clerest.

The sixth chapitre of the fourth tractate treteth of the issue of the rooks and
of her progression.
THe moeuynge and issue of the rooks which ben vicairs of the king is such /
that the right rook is black and the lift rook is white / And when the chesse
ben set as well the nobles as the common people first in their propre places /
The rooks by their propre virtue have no wey to issue but if hit be made to
them by the nobles or common people / For they ben enclosed in their propre
sieges / And the reason why is such That for as much as they ben vicaires
lieutenants or comyssioners of the king / Their auctoryte is of none effect
to fore they issue out / And that they have begone truhaunce their office /
For as long as they be within the palais of the king / So long may they not
use ne execute their commyssion / But anon as they issue they may use their
auctorite / And ye shall understand that their auctorite is great / for they
represente the psone of the king / and therefore where the tablier is wide they
may ^^nne all the triblier / In like wise as they goon through the royame and
they may goo as well white as black as well on the right sid^ and lift as
foreward and backward / And as fer may they run as they find the tablier
wide whether hit be of his adversaries as of his owen fellowship / And when the
rook is in the myddell of the tablier / he may goo which way he will in to
four right lignes on every side and hit is to wete that he may in no wise goo
cornerwyse / but allway right forth going and coming as before is said /
wherefore all the subgettis of the king as well good as evil ought to know by
their moeuynge that auctorite of ye vicairca and comyssioners ought to be
verray true rightwis and Just / and ye shall understand that they ben strong
and virtuous in bataylle For the two rooks only may vaynquysshe a king their
aduersarye and take him / and take from him his life and his royame / And this
was done when chirus king of perse And darius king of medes slew baltazar
and took his royame from him. Which was neuew to enylmoradach under whom this
game was founden.

The seventh chapitre of the fourth book treteth of the issue of the common
people etc
ONe issue and one mouynge apperteyneth unto all the people / For they may goo
fro the point they stand in at the first meuynge unto the third point right
forth to fore them / and when they have so don they may afterward mean no more
but fro one point right forth in to an other / And they may never return
backward And thus going forth fro point to point They may get by virtue and
strength / that thing that the other noble find by dignyte / And if the
knights and other nobles help hem that they come to the ferthest sign to
fore them where their adversaries were set. They acquyre the dignyte that the
queen has granted to her by grace / For if any of them may come to this said
ligne / if he be white as labourer draper phi^icyen or kepar of the cite ben /
they reteyne such dignyte as the queen has / for they have gotten hit / and
than retornynge again homeward / they may goo like as it is said in the
chapitre of the queen And if any of the pawns that is black / as the smyth the
merchant the tauerner and the rybaulde may come with out damage in to the same
vtterist ligne / he shall get by his virtue the dignyte of the black queen And
ye shall understand / when these common people mean right forth in her ligne /
and find any noble person or of the people of their adversaries set in the
point at on any side to fore him / In that corner point he may take his
aduersarye wherther hit be on the right side or on the lift / And the cause is
that the adversaries ben suspecyous that the common people lie In a wait to
Rob her goods or to take her persons when they goo upward right forth. And
therefore he may take in the right angle to fore him one of his adversaries / As
he had espied his person / And in the lift angle as robber of his goods /
and whether hit be going foreward or retornynge fro black to white or white to
black the pawn must allway goo in his right ligne / and allway take in the
corner that he finds in his way / but he may not goo on neither side till he
has been in the furdest ligne of thesehequer / And that he has taken the
nature of the d^^nghtes of the queen / And than he is a fires / And than he may
goo on all sides cornerwyse fro point to point only as the queen does
fighting and taking whom he finds in his way / And when he is thus comen
to the place where ye noble^ his adversaries were set he shall be named white
fires or black fires / after the point that he is in / and there takes he the
dignyte of the queen etc And all these things may appear to them that beholden
ye play of the chesse / and ye shall understand that no noble man ought to
have despite of the common people / for hit has been often times seen / that by
their virtue a wit / Diuerce of them have comen to right high a great astate
as poopes bisshoppes Emperors and kings / As we have in the historye of David
that was made king / of a shepherd and one of the common people / and of many
other etc. And in like wise we read of the contrary / that many noble men have been brought to myserye by their defaulte As of gyges which was right rich of
lands and of richesses And was so proud that he went and demanded of the god
appollo / if there were any in the world more rich or more happy than he was /
and than he herd a wys that issued out of the fosse or pit of the sacrefices
/ that a people named agalaus sophide which were pour of goods and rich of
courage was more acceptable than he which was king And thus the god Appollo
allowed more the sapience and the seurte of the pour man and of his lityll
main / than he did the astate and the person of giges ne of his rich main
/ And hit is more to allow a lityll thing scurly poursiewed than much good
taken in fere and dread And for as much as a man of low signage is by his
virtue enhaunsed so much the more he ought to be glorious and of good renomee
/ virgile that was born in lombardye of ye nation of mantua and was of low and
simple lignage / yet he was souerayn in wisdom and science and the most noble
of all the poctes / of whom the renome is and shall be during the world / so
hit happend that an other poet axid and demanded of him wherefore he setted not
the versis of homere in his book / And he answered that he should be of right
great strength and force that should pluck the clubbe out of hercules hands /
And this suffyceth the state and draughtis of the common people etc.

The eight chapitre and the last of the fourth book of the epilogacion and
recapitulacion of this book.
FOr as much as we see and know that the memory of the people is not retentyf
but right forgetefull when some here long talis a historyes which they cannot
all reteyne in her mind or record Therefore I have put in this present
chapitre all ye things abouesayd as shortly as I have conne / First this play
or game was founden in the time of em^merodach king of Babilone / And exerses
the philosopher otherwise named philometer fond hit / And the cause why / was
for the correction of the king like as hit apperith in three the first
chapitres for the said king was so tyrannous and felon that he might suffer no
correction / But slew them and did do put hem to death / that correctid him /
and had than do put to death many right wise men Than the people being sorrowful
and right evil plesid of this evil life of the king prayed and required the
philosopher / that he would repryse and tell the king of his folly / And than
the philosopher answered that he should ^^dede if he so did / and the people said
to him / Certes then ought sonner will to dye to the end that thy renome
might come to the people than the life of the king should continue in evil for
lack of thy counceyll / or by fault of reprehension of the / or that thou
dare not do and show / that thou say / And when the philosopher herd this
he promisid to the people yt he would put him in deuoyr to correct him / and
than he began to think in what manner he might escape the death and keep to the
people his promise / And than thus he made in this manner and ordained
theschequer of.lxiiii. points as Is a fore said / And did do make the form
of chequers of gold and silver In humayne figure after the facyons and forms
as we have dyuysid and shewid to you to fore in their chapitres / And ordained
the moeuynge and thestate after that it is said in the chapitres of theschesses
And when the philosopher had thus ordained the play or game / and that hit
plesid all them that saw hit / on a time as the philosopher played on hit /
the king came and saw hit and desired to play at this game / And than the
philosopher began tenseigne and teache the king the science of the play and
the draughtes. Saying to him first how the king ought to have in him self
pytie. debonairte and rightwisnes as hit is said to fore in the chapitre of the
king And he enseygned to him the estate of the queen and what manners she ought
to have And than of the alphyns as connceyllours and Iuges of the royame And
after the nature of the knights / how they ought to be wise. true and curtoys
and all the order of knyghthode And than after / the nature of the vicaires
and rooks as hit apperyth in their chappitre And after this how the common people
ought to goo each in his office / And how they ought to serve the nobles. And
when the philosopher had thus taught and enseigned the king and his nobles by
the manner of the play and had rephended him of his evil manners / The king
demanded him upon pain of death to tell him the cause why and wherefore he had
made and founden this play and game And what thing meuyd him thereto / And
than the philosopher constrained by fere and dread answered / that he had
promysid to the people which had required him that he should correct and
reprise the king of his evil vices / but for as much as he doubtid the death
and had seen that the king did do slay the sages and wise men / That were so
hardy to blame him of his vices / he was in great anguysshe and sorrow / how he
might find a manner to correct and reprehende the king / And to save his owen
life / and thus he thought long and studied that he fond this game or play /
Which he has do set forth for to amend and correct the life of the king
and to change his manners / and he adioustyd with all that he had founden this
game for so much as the lords and nobles habondynge in delyces and richessis
/ And enioynge temporell peace should eschew ydlenes by playnge of this game /
And for to give hem cause to leave her pensifnes and sorrows / In auysynge and
studyynge this game. And when the king had herd all these causes / He thought
that the philosopher had found a good manner of correction / And than he
thanketh him greatly / and thus by thenseygnement and learning of the
philosopher he changid his life his manners and all his evil conditions And by
this manner hit happend that the king that to fore time had been vicyous and
disordynate in his living was made Just. and virtuous. debonayre. gracious and
and full of virtues unto all people / And a man that lyuyth in this world with
out virtues lives not as a man but as a best / And therefore my right
redoubted lord I pray almighty god to save the king our souerain lord and to
give him grace to issue as a king and tabounde in all virtues / and to be
assisted with all other his lords in such wise yt his noble royame of England
may prospere and habounde in virtues / and yt sin may be eschewid justice
kept / the royame defended good men rewarded malefactors punysshid and the
idle people to be put to labor that he with the nobles of the royame may regne
gloriously In conquerynge his rightful enheritaunce / that verray peace and
charity may endure in both his royames / and that merchandise may have his
course in such wise that every man eschew sin / and encrece in virtuous
occupacions / Praynge your good grace to resseyue this lityll and simple book
made under the hope and shadow of your noble protection by him that is your
most humble servant / in gree and thank And I shall pray alimighty god for
your long life and welfare / which he preserve And send you
thaccomplisshement of your hye noble. Joyous and virtuous desirs Amen: /:
