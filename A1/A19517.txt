The Art or craft of Rhetoryke.









To the reverend father in god and his singular good lord / the lord Hugh
Faryngton Abbot of Redynge / his pore client and perpetual servant Leonarde
Cocks desires long and prosperouse life with encreace of honor.
Considering my special good lord how great ly and how many ways I am
bounden to your lordshyp / and among all other that in so great a nombre of
conning men which are now within this region it has pleased your goodness to
accept me as worthy for to have the charge of the instruction and bringing up
of such youth as resorteth to your gramer schole / founded by your
antecessours in this your town of Redynge / I studied a long space what thing
I might do next the busy and diligent occupienge of my self in your said
service / to the which both conscience and your stipende does straytly bind
me / that might be a significacion of my faithful and seruysable heart which I
owe to your lordeshyp / and again a long memory both of your singular and
beneficial favor toward me: and of mine industry and diligence employed in
your ser uyce to some profit: or at the leest way to some delectacion of the
inhabitauntes of this noble realm now slouryshynge under the most excellent
and victorious prince our souerain Lord king Henry the. viii.

And when I had thus long prepensed in my mind what thing I might best those
out: non offered it self more conuenyent to the profit of young students
(which your good lordshyp has always tenderly favored) and also meter to my
profession: than to make some proper work of the right pleasant and
persuadible art of Rhetorique / which as it is very necessary to all such as
will either be Aduoca tes and Proctours in the law: or else apt to be sent in
their Princes Ambassades / or to be techers of gods word in such manner as
may be most sensible and accept to their audience / and finally to all them
having any thing to purpose or to speak before any company (what someuer they
be) So contraryly I se no science that is less taught and declared to Scolers
/ which ought chiefly after the knowledge of Gramer ones had to be instruct in
this facul tie / without the which oftentimes the rude vtteraunce of the
Advocate greatly hinders and apeyreth his clie^tes cause. Likewise the unapt
disposicion of the precher (in orderyng his matter) confounds the memory of
his herers / and briefly in declarynge of matters: for lack of inuencion and
order with due elocucion: great tediousnes is engendered to the multitude being
present / by occasion whereof the spe ker is many times ere he have ended his
tale: either left almost aloon to his no little confusion: or else (which is a
like rebuke to him) the audience falls for werynes of his ineloquent language
fast on sleep.

willing therefore for my part to help such as are destrouse of this Art (as
all surely ought to be which entende to be regarded in any comynaltie) I have
partly translated out a work of Rhetorique written in the Latin tongue: and
partly compyled of mine own: and so made a little treatise in manner of an
Introductyon into this aforesaid Science: and that in our English tongue.
Remembrynge that every good thing (after the sayenges of the Philosopher) the
more common it is: the more better it is. And furthermore true stynge thereby to
do some pleasure and case to such as have by negligence or else falls persuacions
be put to the lernyng of other sciences or ever they have attained any mean
knowledge of the Latin tongue.

which my said labor I humbly offer to your good Lordeshyp / as to the chyefe
maintener and nouryssher of my study / besechynge you / though it be far
within your merits done to me / to accept it as the first assay of my pore
and simple wit / which if it may first please your Lordshyp / and next the
reders / I trust by the aid of almighty god to endyte other works both in
this faculty and other to the laud of the high godhed / of whom all goodness
does proceed / and to your Lordshyps pleasure / and to profit and delectacion
of the Reder.

WHo someuer desires to be a good Orator or to dyspute and commune of any
manner thing / him behooves to have four things.

The first is called Inuencion / for he must first of all imagine or Invent in
his mind what he shall say.

The second is named Judgment. For he must have wit to deserve and judge
whether tho things that he has found in his mind be convenient to the
purpose or not. For ofte^tymes if a man lack this property / he may as well
tell that that is against him as with him / as experience does daily show. The
third is Disposicion / whereby he may know how to order and set every thing in
his due place / leest though his inuencion and judgment be never so good / he
may happen to be counted (as the common proverb says) to put the carte before
the horse. The fourth and last is such things as he has invented: and by
Judgment known apt to his purpose when they are set in their order so to
speak them that it may be pleasant and delectable to the audience / so that it
may be said of him that hystories make mention that an old woman said ones by
Demosthenes / and syns has been a common proverb among the Greeks (...) which
is as much to say as (This is he) And this last property is called among
learned men (Eloquence. Of these four the most difficile or hard is to invent
what thou must say / wherefore of this part the Rethoricieus which be masters
of this Art: have written very much and diligently.

Inuencion is comprehended in certain places / as the Rhetoricieus call them /
out of whom he that knows ye faculty may fetch easily such things as be
mete for the matter that he shall speak of / which ma ter the Orators calls
the Theme / and in our vulgar tongue it is called improperly the Anthethem.
The theme purposed: we must after the rules of Rhetorique go to our places that
shall ano^ show unto us what shall be to our purpose.

Example.
IN old time there was great envy between two noble men of Rome / of who^ the
one was called Milo / and the other Clodius / which malice grew so far that
Clodius laid wait for Milo on a season when he should ride out of the City /
and in his journey set upon him / and there as it chanced: Clodius was slain
/ where upon this Clodius friends accused Milo to the Cenate of murder. Tully
which in tho days was a great Advocate in Rome should plede Miloes cause. Now
it was open that Milo had slain Clodius / but whether he had slain him
laufully or not was the double. So than the Theme of Tullies oracio^ or plee
for Milo was this / that he had slain Clodius laufully / and therefore he ought
not to be punisshed / for the confirmacion whereof (as does appear in Tullies
oracion) he did bring out of places of Rhetoryque arguments to prove his said
Theme or purpose. And likewise must we do when we have any matter to speak or
comun of. As if I should make an oracion to the laud and praise of the Kings
highness: I must for the Inuencyon of such things as be for my purpose go to
places of Rhetorique / where I shall casely find (after I know the rules) that
that I desire. Here is to be noted that there is no Theme but it is contained
un der one of the four causes / or for the more playnnes four kinds of
Oracions.

The first is called Logycall / which kind we call properly disputacio^. The
second is called Demonstratiue. The third Deliberatiue. The fourth Judicial
/ and these three last be properly called spices or kinds of oracions / whose
natures shall be declared seperately hereafter with the craft that is required
in every of them. All themes that perteine to Logike either they be simple or
compounde. As if a man desire to know of me what Justice is. This only thig
Justice is my theme. Or if disputacion be had in company upon religion / and I
would declare the very nature of religion / my theme should be this simple or
one thing religion. But if it be doubted whether Justice be a virtue or not /
and I would prove the part affyrma tyue / my theme were now compou^de / that
is to say / Justice is a virtue / for it is made of two things knyt and vn^ed
together / Justice and virtue. Here must be noted that Logike is a plain and a
sure way to instruct a man of the troth of every thing / and that in it the
natures / causes / parts / and effects of things are by certain rules
discussed and serched out / so that nothing can be perfectly and properly
known but by rules of Logike / which is nothing but an obserua cyon / or a
dylygent markynge of nature. whereby in every thing man's reason does
consider what is first / what last / what proper / what improper.

The places or instruments of a simple theme are.

The diffinicion of the thing. The causes. The parts. The effects.
Example. If thou enquire what thig Iu stice is / whereof it comes / what
parts is has / and what is the office or effect of every part / than have
thou diligently serched out the hole nature of Justice / and handeled thy
simple theme according to the precepts of Logicians / to whom our auctour
leueth such ma^s to be discussed of the^ / how beit somewhat ye Rhetoricia^s
have to do with ye simple theme / and asmoche as shall be for their intent he
will show hereafter. For many times the orator must use both diffinicions and
divisions. But as they be in Logike plain and compendiouse / so are they in
Rhetorike exte^ded and painted with many figures and ornaments belongyng to
the science. Nevertheless to satisfy the reders mind / and to alleuiate the
tediousnes of searching these places / I will open the manner and facion of the
handelyng of the theme aforsayd as plainly as I can / after the precepts of
Logike.

First to search out the perfect knowledge of Justice: I go to my first place
(...) on / and fetch from Aristotle in his (...) the Diffinicion of Justice /
which is this.

Justice is a moral virtue / whereby men be the werkers of rightful things
(that is to say) whereby they both love and also do such things as be just.
This do^e: I search the causes of Justice (that is to say) from whens it took
the first beginning / and because that it is a moral virtue: and Plato in the
end of his Dialogue Meno^ concludes that all virtue comes of god: I am
assured that god is the chief cause of Justice: declaryng it to the world by
his Instrument man's wit / which the same Plato affyrmeth in the beginning of
his laws. The Diffinicion and cause had: I come to the third place called
parts to know whether there be but one kind of Justice or else many. And for
this purpose I find that Arystotle in the fyfte of his Ethikes deuideth
Justice in two speces or kinds. One yt he calls Justice legitime or legal /
an other that he called Equite.

Justice legal is that that consysteth in the superiors which have power for
to make or statute laws to the iferiours. And the office or end of this
Justice is to make such laws as be both good and according to right and
conscience / and tha^ to declare them / and when they are made and publisshed
as they ought to be / to se that they be put in ure / for what avails it to
make never so good laws: if they be not observed and kept. And finally that
the maker of the law apply his hole study and mind to the welthe of his
subjects and to the common profit of them. The other kind of Justice which
men call Equity is where by a man neither takes nor gives less nor more
than he ought / but in gyuynge takes good head that every man have according
as he deserves. This Equity is again divided into Equity distributyue of
common things and Equity Commutatiue. By Equity distributyue is distributyd
and given of comen goods to every man according to his deservings and as he
is worthy to have. As to divide among such as long to the Church of the
Church goods after the quality of their merytes: and to them being Civil
persons of the common treasour of the City according as they are worthy.

In this part is comprehended the punishment of mysdoers and trangressours of
the law / to whom correccion must be distributed for the common wealth
according to their demerites / after the prescripcions of the laws of the
country / made and determined for the punisshment of any manner of
transgressour. Equity co^mutatiue is a just manner in the chaungynge of thyng^
from one to another / whose office or effect is to keep just dealing in
equytie / as byenge / selling / and all other bargaynes lawful. And so are
herewith the spices of Justice declared their offices / which was the fourth
and last place.

Our auctour also in a great work that he has made upon Rhetorike / declares
the handelynge of a theme simple by the same example of Justice / adding two
pla ces mo / which are called a^ines and contraries on this manner.

what is Justice? A virtue whereby to every thing is given that that to it
belongs.

what is the cause thereof? Man's will consenting with laws and manners.

How many kinds? Two.

which? Commutatiue and Distributive / for in two manners is our medlynge with
other men / either in things of our substance and wares / or in gentle and
cyuyle conversation.

what thing is Justice commutatiue? Right and equity in all contractes.

what is Justice distributive? Justice of civil living.

How manyfolde is Justice dystrybutyue? Either it is common or private. The
common is called in latin Pi^tas / but in english it may be most properly
named good order / which is the crown of all ver tues conceruynge honest and
civil conuersacyon of men together / as the hedes with the mean comonalty in
good unity and concord. Pryuate or several Justice dystrybutyue is honest and
amyable frendeshyp and conversation of neighbors.

what are the offices? To do for every man / rich or pore / of what estate so
ever he be / and for our country / for our wives / children / and friends /
that that ought to be done for every of them.

Affynes or virtues nigh to Justice are constancy / lyberalytie / temperaunce.

Things contrary are fere / couetyse / prodygalytie.

And this is the manner of handelynge of a simple Theme dialecty call. But yet
let not the reder deceive him self / and think that the very perfyte knowledge
is showed him all here. And that which has be^ showed now: is somewhat general
and brief. More sure and exact knowledge is contained in Logike / to whom I
will advise the^ that be studiouse to resort and to search every thing in his
own proper faculty.

Of a Theme compounde.
Every Theme compounde: either it is proved true or falls. Now whether thou
wylt pu^ or improve any thing: it must be done by argument. And yt any Theme
compounde: be it Logical or Rhetorycall / it must be referred to the rules of
Logike by the^ to be proved true or falls. For this is the dyfference that is
between these two sciences / that the Logician in dysputynge observes certain
rules for the setting of his words being solicitous that there be spoken no
more nor no less than the thing requires / and that it be euin as plaily
spoken as it is thought. But the Rhethorician seeks about and boroweth where
he can asmoche as he may for to make the simple and plain Logical arguments
gaye and delectable to the (...). So than the sure judgment of arguments or
reasons must be learned of the logician / but the craft to set the^ out with
pleasant figures and to delate the matter belongs to the Rhetorician. As in
Miloes cause / of whom was made mention before. A logician would briefly argue
/ who so ever violently will slay an other / may lawfully of the other be
slain in his defense. Clodius would vyolently have s^ain Milo / wherefore
Clodius might laufully be slain of Milo in Miloes own defense. And this
argument the logicians call a Sillogisme in Dar^ / which Tully in his oracion
extends that in four or five leaves it is scant made an end of / nor no man
can have knowledge whether Tullies argument that he makes in his oracyon for
Milo / be a good argument or not / and how it holds / except he can by
Logyke reduce it to the perfect and brief form of a Sillogisme / taking in
the mean season of the Rhetorycyans what ornaments have been cast to for to
light and augment the oracyon / and to give it a majesty.

The places out of whom are found arguments for the proving or improuynge
of compounde Themes / are these following. Diffinicion like Cause contrary
Parts


OF the places of arguments shall be spoken hereafter. For as touchyuge the^
in all things the Rhetorician and Logician do agree. But as concerning the
craft to form arguments when thou have found them in their places / that
must be learned of the Logician / where he treats of the form of sillogismes
/ (...) ^es and inductions.

Of an oracion demonstratiue.
THe use of an oracion demonstratiue is i praise or dispraise / which kind or
manner of oracion was greatly used sometime in common accions / as does declare
the oracions of Demosthenes / and also many of Thucidides oracions. And there
ben three manners of oracions demonstratiue.

The first conteyneth the praise or dysprayse of persons. As if a man would
praise the kings hyghnes / or dysprayse some ill person / it must be done by
an ora cion demonstratiue. The second kind of an oracion demonstratiue is:
where in is praised or dyspraysed / not the person but the deed. As if a thief
put him self in ieopdy for the safegarde of a true man / against other thieves
and murderers / the person can not be praised for his vicious living / but yet
the deed is worthy to be commended. Or if one should speak of Peter's denyeng
of Christ / he has nothing to disprayse yt person save only for this deed.
The third kind is: wherein is lauded or blamed another person nor deed / but
some other thing as virtue / vice / justice / iniutie / charity / envy /
patience / wrath / and such like.

Parts of an Oracion.
The parts of an oracion prescribed of Rhetoriciens are these.

The Preamble or exorden. The tale or narracion. The proving of the matter or
contencion. The conclusion.
Of the which parts mencyon shall be made herafter in every kind of oracions
/ for they are not found generally in every oracion / but some have ^oo parts
/ and some less.

Of the Preamble.
GEnerally the Preamble not alonly in an oracion demonstratiue / but also in
the other two is contained and must be ^ched out of three places / that is to
say o^ benevolence / attencion / and to make (...) a^y to be known / which
the ^oricians call Docilite.

Benevolence is the place whereby the herer is made willing to here us / and it
is contained in the thing that we speak of / (...) them whom we speak to / and
in our own person. The easyest and most used place of benevolence consysteth
in the office or duty of the person / when we show that it is our duty to do
that we be about.

Out of this place is fet ye p^a^ble of sait Gregory Nazazene / made to the
praise of saint Basyll / where he says that it is his his duty to praise
saint Basyll for three causes. For the great love and frendeshyp that has been
always between them / and again for the remembrance of the most fair and
excellent virtues that were in him / and thyrdely that the church might have an
example of a good and holy Bishop. Trewly by our authors license me thinks
that in the preamble Nazazen does not only take benevolence out of the place of
his own person / but allo out of the other two / wha^ he shows the cause of
his duetye / for in praysynge his friend he did but his duetye. In praysynge
(...) virtues / he came to the place of beneu^ce of him that he spoke of / as
touching the example that the church should have / it was for their profit /
and concerning the place of benevolence / taken of them that he spoke to. But
our author regarded chiefly the principal proposicion / which was that saint
Gregory Nazazene was bound to praise saint Basyll.

A like example of benevolence taken out of the place of office or duty / is
in the oracyon that Tully made for the Poet Archias / which begins thus.

My lords that be here iuges / if there be in me any wit / which I know is
but small / or if I have any crafty use of making an oracion / wherein I de^e
not but yt I have metely excercysed my self / or if any help to that science
comes out of other lyberall arts / in whom I have occupied al my life /
surely I am bound to no man more for them than to Archias / which may
lawfully if I may do any m^ any profit by them / challenge a chief por cion
for him therein.

Out of this place did this same Tully fetch the beginning of his first
epistle / in whom he wrytethe to one Lentule on this manner: I do so my deutie
in all points toward you / and so great is the love and reverence that I bear
unto you that all other men say that I can do no more / and yet me seems that
I have never don that that I am bound to do / either to you or in your cause.

We may also get benevolence by reason of them / whom we make our oracion of:
As if we say that we can never praise him to hyghly / but yt he is worthy much
more laud and praise. And so takes sait Nazianzene benevolence in his said
oracion for samet Basile.

Also of them before whom we speak / as if we say / it is for their profit to
laud or praise the person. And that we know very well how much they have
always loved him / and that he ought therefore to be prai sed the more for
their sakes. The manner is also to get us benevolence in the preface of our
oracion / by pynchyng and blamyng of our adversary. As does Tullie in the
oracion that he made for one Aulus Cecinna / wherein he begins his proeme
thus If temerite and lake of shame could as much prevail in plees before the
justices / as does audacite and temerarious boldness in the feldes and
deserte places / there were no remedy but even so must Aulus Cecinna be
overcome in this matter by Sextus Ebucius impudence / as he was in the field
overcome by his insidious audacite. And these be the common forms of
benevolence.

A man may also fetch his proeme out of the nature of the place where he
speaks / as Tullie does in the oracion made for Pompeius for the sendynge of
him into Asie against king Mithridates of Pontus / and king Tigraues of
Armenie on this manner: how be it my lords and may sters of this noble city
of Rome / I haueal times thought it a synguler rejoice to me if I might ones se
you gadred to gyther in a company / to here some public oracion of mine / and
again I iuged no place to be so ample and so honorable to speak in as this
is. and(...).

Or he may begin at the nature of the time that is than / or at some other
cyrcum staunce of his matter / as Tully takes the beginning of his oracion for
Telius at the time / this wise.

If so be it my lords iuges any man be now present here that is ignor^t of
your laws / of your process in iugementes / and of your customs / surely he
may well mar uell what so heinous a matter this should be / that it only should
be sit upon in an high fecst day / when all the comonaltye after their old
custom are given to the sight of plays / ordained after a perpetual usage for
the nones for them / all matters of the law laid for the time utterly a part.

He began also an other oracion for one Sertus Roseius / out of the danger of
the season that he spoke in.

One may beside these use other manner of prohemes / which by cause they are
not set out of the very matter it self / or else the circumstaunces / as in
these aforsayd they are called peregrine or strange prohemes. And they be
taken out of se^tences / sole^pne peticions / manners or customs / laws / sta
tutes of nacyons and contreys. And on this manner does Aristides begin his
oracion made to the praise of Rome.

Demos^henes in his ^racyon made against Eschines / took his preface out of a
solemn peticien / besechynge the gods that he might have as good favor in
yt cause / as he had sou^de in all other matters yt he had done before for the
common wealth.

In like manner begins Tully the ora cion that he made for one Murena / and
also the oracyon that he made unto the Romans after his return from exyle.

He begins also an other oracyon / which he made as touching a law
decreed for the division of feldes among the comunes out of a custom among
them / on this wise.

The manner and custom of our old faders of Rome has been. etc. And this is
the manner of prefaces in any oracion / which is also observed in the making of
epistles / how beit there is far less craft in them than is in an oracyon.

There is yet an other form and manner to begin by insinuacion / wherefore it
beho ueth to know that insinuacion is / wha^ in the beginning / if the matter
seem not lau dable or honest / we find an excuse therefore. Example / Homere in
his Iliade describes one Thersites / that he was most foul and evil favored
of all the Greeks that came to the battle of Troy / for he was both gogle
eyed / and lame on the one leg / with crooked and pynched shulders / and a
long pyked head / balde in very many places. And beside these fautes he was a
great folysshe babbler / and right foul mouthed / and full of debate and strife
/ ^artynge always against the heddes and wise men of the army.

Now if one would take upon him to make an oracio^ to the praise of this losel
/ which matter is of little honesty in it self / he must use instead of a
preface an insinuacion. That what thing poets or commune fame does either
praise or dispraise ought not to be given credence to / but rather to be
suspecte. For ones it is the nature of poets to said and lie / as both
Homere and Uirgile / which are the princes and heddes of al poets do witness
the^ self. Of whom Homere says / that poets make many lies / and Uirgile he
says: The most part of the seen is but oeceyte. Poets have seen blake souls
under the ^rthe / poets have feigned and made many lies of the pale kingdom of
Plato / and of the water of Stigie / and of dogs in hell. And again common
rumors how often they ben vain / it is so open that it need not to be
declared. wherefore his trust is that the hearers will more regard his saying
than feigned fables of poets / and fleyng tales of light folks / which ar for
the more part the grounders of fame and rumors.

An example may be ^et out of the declamacion that Erasmus made to the praise
of folysshenes.

An other example has the same Erasmus in his second book of Copia / which is
this: Plato in the fyfte dialogue of his communaltie wyllethe that no man shall
have no wife of his own / but that every woman shall be commune to every man. If
any man than would either praise or defend this mind of Plato / which is both
contrary to Christ's religion and to the commune living of me^ / he might as
Erasmus teaches / begin thus.

I know very well that this matter which I have determined to speak of / will
seem unto you at the first herynge / not only very strange / but also right
abominable. But that nar withstanding / if it will please you a little while
so defer you judgment till ye have herd the su^me of such reasons as I will
bring forth in the cause / I double nothing but that I shall make the
truth so euydent that you all will with one assent approve it / and knowledge
that ye have been hitherto maruelously deceived in your oppynyon / and somdele
to alleuiate your minds / ye shall understand that I am not my self author
of the thing / but it is the mind and saying of the excellent and most
highly named philosopher Plato / which was undoubted so famous a clerk / so
discrete a man / and so virtuous in all his deeds / that ye may be sure he
would speak nothig but it were on a right perfyte ground / and that the thing
were of it self very expedient / though peradventure it show far otherwise
at the first herynge.

In all prefaces of preambles must be good heed taken that they be not to far
fet / nor to long.

These affectuouse words / I rejoice / I am sorye / I uleruaile / I am glad
for your sake / I desire / I sere / I pray god / and such other like / be very
apre for a preface.

Of the second place of a preface / called Attencion.
THe herers shall be made attent or diligent to give audience / if the orarour
make promise yt he will show them new things / or else necessary or profita ble
/ or if he say yt it is an hard matter that he has in handelynge / or else
obscure and not easy to be understand / except they give right good attendaunce.

wherefore it is expedyent that if they will have the percepcion of it / that
they give a good care. But as concerning the newness or profit of the matter /
it makes not all only ye herer to give a good cre (which thing is called
attencion) but also makes him well willing for to be present / which is
benevolence.

Docilite.
DOcilite whereby we make the matter plain and easy to be perceived / is not
greatly required in this kind of oracion / for it in belonging properly to
derke and obscure causes / in which we must ^myse that we will not use great
ambages / or to go (as me^ say) round about the bus^h / but to be short and
plain.

Of narracion which is the second perte of an oracion.
The Narracion or tale wherein persons are praised / is the declaryng of their
life and doings after the fas^hion of an history. The places out of the
which it is sought are: The persons birth. His chyldhode. His adolescencie.
His man's state. His old age. His death and what follows after.

IN his birth is considered of what stock he came / what chau^ sed at the
time of his natiuite or nighe upon / as in the natiuite of Christ shepeherdes
hard angels sing.

In his chyldhode are marked his bringing up and tokens of wisdom coming:
As Horace in his fourth Satire shows / how in his chyldhode his father
taught him by examples of such as were than living to flee from vice and to
give him self to virtue.

In adolescencie is considered where to he than gyuethe him self: As in the
first comedy of Tere^ce one Simo tells his servant Sosia / that though all
young men for the more part give them self to some peculiare thing / wherein
they set their chief delyght / as some to have goodely horses / some to
cherysshe hounds for huntyng / and some are given only to their books / his
sone Pa^philus loved none of these more one tha^ an other / and yet in all these
he exercised him self mesurably.

In man's state and old age is noted what office or rule he bare among his
citisens / or in his country / what acts he did / how he governed such as
were vnd him / how he ^spered / and what fortune he had in such things as he
went about. Example here of is in Saluste / which co^pareth to gether Cato and
Caesar / sayng that both their stock / age and eloquence / were almoost like
and egall / their excellency and greatness of spirit and wit was also like
and egal / and like fame and worship had they both attained how be it not by
a like way. Caesar was had i great estimacion for his benefits and and
liberalite. Cato had gotten hi^ a name for his perfight and upright living.
Caesar was praised for his gentilnes and pity. Cato was honored for his (...)
and surete. The the other wanne much bruyt by gy uynge large gyfres / by helping
such as were in dystresse / and by forgyuyng of tres passes done against him.
Cacons fame did sprede because he would neither be forgyuen of none offense /
neither forgive non other / but as any man had deserved / so to cause him to be
dealt with. In the one was great refuge to such as were in mysery: (...) the
other was fore pu^shment and per^ to mysdoers and evil transgressors (...)
law. Briefly to conclude it was all (...) mind and pleasure to labor
diligently night and day in his friends cau ses / to care less for his own
busynes the for theyrs / to deny nothing that was worcester thy to be asked / his
desire was evermore to be in war / to have a great host of me under his
governance / that by his noble and hardy faicies his valyantnes might be the
more known and spread abrood.

Co^traryly all Catons study was on tem perau^ce / and to do in no manner other
wise than was convenient and syctynge for such a man as he was / and chiefly
he set his myn^e to seueryty / he never made no com parison with the rich
man in richesse / nor with the mighty man in power. But y^ (...) required /
with the hardy man in boldness / with the temperate in moderacion / with the
good man in innocence and just dea ling. He cated not for the name / it was suf
ficie^t to him to have the deed / and so / the less he cared for glory / the
more always he opteyned. Many such comparisons very profitable for this
intent / are also in Plu tarche in his book of noble men's lives.

A goodly eusa^ple of this place is in the oracion that Hermolaus Barbarus made
to the emperor Frederike and Marimilian his son / which for because it is so
long I let it pass. A like ensample is in Tullies orac^on / that he made to
the people of Rome for Pompeyus / to be sent against (...).

Some there be that divide the lands of persons into three ^noes of goods /
begyunynge the narracion at them / which thing our author does not greatly
commend / but rather in rehersyng of any per sons deeds / if there can not be
kept an order of history / and many things must be spoken. It were after his
mind best to touch first his acts done by prudence / and next by justice /
thirdely by fortitude of the mind / and last by temperaunce / and so to gather
the narracion out of this four catdinall virtues. As if one should praise saint
^usten / after that he has spoken of his pa rentele and bringing up in youth
/ and is come to the rehersale of his acts / they may be conveniently
distributed into the places of virtues. On this manner did Tul ly praise Pompey.

I suppose (says he) that in him that should be a head captain over a great
army / ought to be four things. Knowledge of werre / valiantnes / authority /
and felicity.

Here is to be noted that in rehersynge any persons acts / we may have our
chief respect to some peculiare and principal virtue in him / enlargynge and
exalting it by amplificacio^ in manner of a digressio^.

Our author in this work makes no mencyon of the last place that is death and
such things as follow after / but in an other greater work he declares it
thus vrtefly. The death of the person has also his praises / as of such
which have been slain for the defense of their country or prince.

A very goodly ensample for the handelynge of this place is in an epistle that
An gele Policiane writes in his fourth book of epistels to James Antiquarie of
Laurence Medices / how wisely and devoutly he dysposed him self in his death
bed / and of his departing / and what channced at that time.

And so to conclude an oracion Demonstratiue / wherein persons are lauded / is
an historycall exposicion of all his life in order. And there is no difference
between this kind and an history / save that in histories we be more brief
and use less curiosity. Here all things be augme^ted and colored with as
much ornaments of eloquence as can be had.

Confirmacion of our purpose / and confutynge or reprouynge of the contrary /
which are the parts of contencion / are not requisite in this kind of
oracion / for here are not treated any doubtefull matters / to whom contencion
pertains.

Never the less / sometime it happens (how beit it is seldom) that a doubt
may come / which must be either defended / or a^ the leest excused.

Example. (...)
THe french men in old time made mighty war against the Romans / and so
sore besieged them that they were by compulcton constrained to fall to
composicion with the french men for an huge sum of gold / to be paid to
them for the brekynge of the siege / but being in this extreme misery / they
sent for one Camillus / whom not very long before they had banisshed out of
the city / and in his absence made him dietatour / which was the chiefest
digintie among the Romans / and of so great authority / that for the space
of th^e months / for so long dured the office most conveniently / he might
do all thing at his pleasure / whether it concerned death or no / nor no man so
hardy ones to say nay against any thing that he did / so that for the space he
was as a king / having all in his own mere power. Now it chanced that while
this sum was in payenge / and not fully wayed / Camillus of whom I said
before / that being in exile he was made dictatour / came with an army / and
anon bad cease of the payment / and that each party should make ready to
bataile / and so he vainquisshed the french men.

Now if one should praise him of his no ble faites / it should seem that this
was done contrary to the law of arms / to defait the french men of the
raumsom due to them / sy^s the compacte was made before / wherefore it is
necessary for the orato^r to defe^d^ this deed / and to prove that he did
nothing contrary to equity. For the which purpose he has two places. One
apparent / which is a common saying vsu^ped of the po^te. ^osus a^ virtus qui^
in host requirat.

That is to say / who will search whether ye deed of enemy against enemy be
either gile or pure valiantnes* But for that in war law is as well to be kept
as in other things. This saying is but of a feeble ground. The other is of a
more strong assurau^ce / which Titus Liuius writes in his fyfte book from
the buildynge of Rome / where he reherceth this history now menetoned / and
that answer is this / that the co^pacte was made to pay the foresaid ransom
after that Camillus was created dictatour / at what time it was not lawful
that they which were of far less authority / ye and had put them self
holy in his hand / should entermedle them with any manner of treatise without
his license / and that he was not bound to stand to their bargayne. The
which argument is deducte out of two circumstaunces / whereof one is the time
of the making of the compacte / and the other / the persons that made it /
which two circumstaunces may briefly be called when / and who. Likewise if an
oracion should be made to the laud of saint Peter / it behooves to excuse his
denyenge of christ / that it was rather of divine power and will: than
otherwise / for a confortable example to sinners of grace if they repent.

This is the manner of handelynge of an oracion demonstratiue / in which the
person is praised.

The author in his greater work decla reth the facion by this example.

If one would praise king Charles / he should keep in his oracion this order.

First in declarynge his parentele / that he was king Pipines sone / which
was the first of all kings of Frannee named the most christen king / and by
whom all after him had the same name / and Nephien to Martell / the most
valiauntest prince that ever was. Next / his bringing up under one Peter
Pisane / of whom he was instruct both in Greek and Latin. Tha^ his
adolessencie / which he passed in exercise of arms under in his fader in ye
wars of Acquitaine / where he learned also the Sarazynes tongue.

Being come to man's state / and now king of France / he suvdued Aquitayn /
Italye / Swauelande / and the Saxones. And these wars were so fortunate /
that he ouercam his adversaries more vy aucto ritie and wisdom than by effusion
of blood.

Also many other notable examples of virtue were in him in that age / specially
that he edifted the university of Paris.

Here may by digressio^ be declared how goodly a thing learning is in Princes.
Chiefly such condition apperteyneth to virtue and good living.

Here may be also made comparison of his virtues in war / and of other
agreynge with peace / in the which (as his history makes mencyon) he was more
excellent. For his chief delight was to have peace / and again he was so
gentle and so merciful / that he would rather save ^uyn such as had don him
great offense: and had deserved very well for to dye / tha^ to dystroye them /
though he might do it conveniently.

Beside this / he was so greatly enflamed in the love of god and his holy
chirch / that one Alcuine a noble clerk of England was continually with him /
in whose prea chynge and other gostely communicacion he had a chief pleasure.
His old age he passed in rest and quyetenes fortunately / save for one thing /
that his sons agreed evil betwe^e them.

After his decease reigned his son / holy saint Jews / and so the folowynges
of his death were such that they could be no better / and a very great token
of his good and virtuous living. For if an ill tree can bring furthe no good
fruit / what shall we suppose of this noble king Charles / of whom came so
virtuous and so holy a son: Truly me thinks that hither may be not
inco^ueniently applied the sayenges of the gospel / by their fruits you shall
know them.

Of an oracion Demenstratiue / wherein an act is praised.
When we will praise a^y manner of deed / the most apt preamble for that
purpose shall be to say that the matter perteyneth to the commodities of them
which here us.

^ Example.
When the Romans had expelled their king / whom the hisioriciens call
Tarquine the proud / out of the city / and sully ^nacted that they would ne
uer have king to reign more over them. This Tarqumus went for aid and socour
to the king of Tuscaye / which when he could by no menes entreat the Romans
to receive again their king / he came with all his puissaunce against the city
/ and there long space besieged the Romans / by rea son whereof / great penury
of whete was in the city / and the king of Tuscay had great trust / that
continuynge the siege / he should within a little longer space compel the To
maynes through famine to yield the^ self.

In the mean season a young man of the city named Gaius Mucius / came to the
Senators and showed them that he was purposed if they would give him license
to go surthe of the city to do an act that should be for their great profit
and wealth / whereupon when he had obtained license / privily / with weapon hyd
under his vesture he came to the Tuscans camp / and gate him among the thickest
/ ingh to the tent where as the king sat with his chaunceller / payenge the
sowdi^is the wages. And because that they were almoost of like apparel / and
also the chaunceler spoke many things as a man being in authority / he (...)
de not tell whether of them was the king / nor he durst not ask / leest his
demand would have bewrayed him / for as for language they had one / and
nothing was different / for both Tuscains and Romans were all of Italye / as
in times past / England has had many kings / though the language and people
were on. And thus being in doubt whether of them he might step unto / by
chance he struck the chaunceller instead of the king / and slew him /
wherefore when he was taken and brought before the king / for to punysshe his
hand that had failed in taking one for an other / and again to show the king
how (...) he cared for his menaces / he thrast his hand into the fire / which
at that time was there prepared for sacrifyce / and there in the flame let it
brenne / not ones mouynge it. The king greatly marueylynge at his audaci tie
and hardy nature / commended him greatly thereof / and bad him go his way free:
For the which (as though he would make the king a great amends) he feigned
that. iii. C. of the noblest young men of Rome had conspyred to gyther in like
manner every one after another unawares to slay him / and all to put their bodies
and lives in hasard till time should chance that one might acheue their
intent. For fere whereof the king forth with fell at a pointement with the
Romans / and departed. The young man afterward was named Sceuota / which is
as much to say in Englyssh as left ha^ded. For as I have reherced before / he
burnt his right hand / so that he had lost the use thereof.

IF any orator would in an oracyon commend this deed / he might conveniently
make the preface on this facion.

THere is no doubt my lords and masters of Rome: but that the remembrance
of Seeuolaes name is very pleasant unto your audience / which with one act
that he did / endewed your city with many and great commodytees. etc.

This manner of preface is most conue nyent and best annexyd to such manner of
oracyons demonstratiues.

Never the less it is lawful for us to take our preface (if it be our
pleasure) out of some circumstaunce / as out of the place that our oracion is
made in / or out of the time that we speak in / or else otherwise / according
as we shall have occasyon / As Tullie / in the oracyon that he made for the
restitucyon of Marcus Marcellus / in the which he praises Cezare for the
calling home of the said Marcus marcellus out of exyle / he takes his preamble
out of the time and Cezares person / beginning thus.

THis day my lords Senatoures has made an end of the long scilence that I
have kept a great while / not for any fere that I had / but part for great
sorrow that was in me / and partly for shanie / this day as I said has taken
away that long scilence / ye / and beside that of new brought to me lust and
mind to speak what I would / and what I thought most expe dient / like as I
was before wont to do. For I can not in no manner of wise refrain / but I must
needs speak of the great mekenes of Cezare / of the graciousnes that is in him
/ so habu^dant and so great withal / that never before any such has been wont
to be seen or herd of / and also of the excellent good moderacio^ of all
things which is in him that has all in his own mere power. Nor I can not
let pass his excellent incredible / and divine wisdom unspoken of / before you
at this time.

Of the Narracion.
IN this kind we use but seldom hole narracions / oneles we make our ora cion
before them that know not the history of the act or deed which we be about to
praise. But instead of a narracion we use a proposicion / on this manner.

Among all the noble deeds Cezare that ye have done / there is non that is
more worthy to be praised than this re stitucion of Mark Marcell.

Of Confirmacion / which is the first part of Contencion.
THe places of confirmacion are honesty / perfect / lightnes^ or hardines of
the deed. For after the proheme of the oracion and the narracion / than go we
to the proving of our matter. First showing that it was a very honest deed.
And next / that it was not all only ho nesty: but also profitable. Thirdely as
concerning the easines or difficulty / the praise thereof must be considered /
part in the doer / part in the deed. An easy deed deserves no great praise /
but an hard and a ieoperdouse thing / the sooner and the lighther it is
acheued / the more it is to be lauded.

The honesty of the cause is fet from the nature of the thing yt is spoken of
/ which place lies in the wit of the orator / and may also be fet out of
the philosophers bo kes. It is also copiosely declared of Rhetoriciens / and
very compe^diously handled of Erafmus in his book / entitled of the manner and
craft to make epistels / in the chapitre of a persuadyng epistle. The profit
of the deed / or the commodity may be fet at the circumstaunce of it.
Circumstan^ ces are these / what was done / who did it / when / where it was
done / among whom / by whose help.

As if one would praise Seeuolaes act / of the which mention was made before /
he may.

when he comes to the places of contencion / show first how honest a deed it
is for any man to put his life in ieopardy for the defense of his country /
which is so much the more to be commended that it came of his own mind / and
not by the instigacion of any other / and how profitable it was to the city to
remove so strong and puissaunt an enemy by so good and crafty policy / what
time the city was not well assured of all men's minds that were within the
walls / considering that but a little before many noble young men were detecte
of treason in the same business. And than also the city was almoost destitute
of vitailes / and all other commodities necessary for the defense.

Likewise easynes or difficulty are contained in the circumstaunces of the
cause. As in the example now spoken of / what an hard enterprise it is for one
man to enter into a kings army / and to come to the kings pauilion in the
face of his soldiers to adventure to slay him.

Of the second part of contencion / called confutacion.
COnfutacio^ is the soilyng of such arguments as may be induced against our
purpose / which part is but little used in an oracion demonstratiue. Never the
less / sometime may chan^ce a thing that must be either defended or else at the
leest excused. As if any man would speak of Camillus deed / whereby he recovered
his country / and delivered it from the hands of the French men. Here must be
declared that the bargayne made before was not by Camillus violate.

The places of confutacion be contrary to the places of confirmacion.

Of the conclusion.
THe conclusion is made of a brief enumeracion of such things that we have
spoken of before in the oracion / and in mouynge of affections.

In delectable things or such things that have been well dove / we move our
audience to rejoice thereat / and to do like.

In sad things and heavy / to be sorry for them. In ill and perverse acts / to
beware that they follow not them to their great shame and confusion.

Of an oracion demonstratiue / whereu^ are praised neither persons nor acts /
but some other things / as religion / matrimony / or such other.
THe best beginning will be if i^ be taken out of some high praise of the
thing. But a man may also begin otherwise / either at his own person or at
theyrs before whom he speaks / or at the place in the which he speaks / or at
the season present / or otherwise / as has before ben specified / and here must
we take good head that if we take upon us to praise any thing that is no
praise worthy / than must we use insinuacion / and excuse the turp^ tude /
either by examples or by arguments / as Erasmus does in his epistle prefired
before his oracion made to the praise of folisshnes / of the which I have let
pass the tra^stacio^ because yt epistle is so^ what long.

The narracion.
IN this manner of oracio^ is no ^at racion / but instead thereof the The
toriciens all only propose the ma ter. And this proposicion is in the stead of
the narracion.

A very elega^t example is in the oracion that Angele Policiane made to the
laud of histories / which is this. Among all m^ ner of writers by whom either
the Break tongue or the latin has been in flower and excellence / without
doubt me seems that they did most profit to mankind / by whom the
excellent deeds of nations / princes / or val^ant men have been truly descriued
and put in cronicles.

Likewise if a man praise peace / and show what a commodiouse thing it is /
he may make such a proposicion.

Among all the things which pe^ teine to man's commodity / of what someuer
condition or nature so ever they be / non is so excellent and so worthy to b^
^ad in honor and love / as is peace.

The confirmacion.
THe places of confirmacion be in this oracion. The same yt were in the other
(of whom mention was made before / houesty / profit / easynes / or difficulty.
Honesty is considered in the nature of the thing / also in the persons that
have excercysed it / and the inuenters thereof. And in the auctour of it. As in
the laud of matrimony be considered the au^ tour thereof / which was god him
self / the antiquite that it was made in the first beginning of the world /
and continued (as reason is) to this hour in great honor and reverence. The
persons that have used it / were both patriarchs / as Abraham.

Prophets / as Dauyd. Apostels / as saint Peter. Martyrs / saint Eustache. And
co^^essours / as saint Edward. And (which thing was first proposed) the
nature thereof is such / that without it: man should be like unto be /
oneles all generation should be put aparte. And the commandment of almighty
god not regarded / who bad man and woman should engender and multiply.

Profit and easines is considered in the circumstaunces. Examples may be taken
out of Policians oracio^ / made to the laud of histories-And two oracions of
Erasmus / one to the laud of phisike / and an other to the laud of matrimony.

Of confutacion.
Confutacion has contrary places to confirmacion.

Of the conclusion.
THe periode or conclusion stands in the brief enumeracion of things spoken
before / and in mouyng the affections / as has been above expressed.

Of an oracion deliberatiue.
AN oracio^ deliberatiue is by the which we persuade or dissuade any thing /
and by the which we ask / or whereby we exhort any man to do a thing / or
else to forsake it / and this kind of oracion is much in use / not only in
civil ematers: but also in epistels.

Of the preamble.
WE may begin our oracion in this kind / even like as we did in an or a cion
demonstratiue / but most aptly at our office or duty / leest some men would
think that we did it more of a private affection for our own commodity and
plea sure: than for any other man's profit.

And in this manner Salust in his book of Catheline brings in Cezare /
beginning an oracion. But let us here now what Ce ^ar says.

ALl men my lords Senators which sit concellynge upon any douvtfull matter /
must be void of hatred / frendshyp / anger / pitye / or met^ye. For where any
o^ these things bear a rule / man's mind can not lightely perceive the
truth. ^.

Or else we may begin at the greatene^ of the matter / or danger of the thing
tha^ we speak of / as in the fyfte book of L^us* Camillus makes the preamble
of his (...) cion thus.

MY masters of this City of Ardea / which have been always mine old friends
/ and now (by reason of mine exyle out of Rome) my new neighbors and citizens.
For I thank you of your goodness you have promised that it should so be / and on
the other side my fortune has constray ned me to seek some new dwelling out of
the city where I was brought up and enhabited. I would not that any of you
should think that I am now come among you not remembrynge my condition and
state / but the common reopardy that we be all now in / will compel every man
to open and show the best remedy that he knows for our socoure in this great
fere and necessity.

Not withstanding this / a man may take his beginning otherwise / after any
of the facions before recited / if he list.

Tully in the oracion / wherein he advised the Romans to make Pompey their
chief captain against Withridates and Tigranes / kings of Ponthus and
Armeny / takes in the preface benevolence from his own person / showing by
what occasion he might laufully give council to the Romans / by cause was
elect Praetor of the city. we may also touch our adversaries in the preface /
or else we may touch the manners / either of some several persons / or of the
commons in general. As in the oracion that Porcius Chato made against the
sumptuous^es of the women of Rome / thus beginning.

IF every man my lords and masters of this city would observe and keep the
right and majesty of a man against his own wife / we should have ferte less
encombrance now with the hole thronge tha^ we have. But now our fredome and
liberty is overcome within our own doors by the importunatnes of our wives /
and so au^acitie taken thereof here trodden under the fete / and oppressed in the
parliament house: And because we would not displease no man his own wife at
home: here are we now combred with all / gathered to gyder on a hepe / and
brought in that taking that we dare not ones open our lyppes against them. ^.

we may also begin at the nature of the time that we speak in / or at the
nature of the place / or at any other circumstaunce or thing incident. As L^us
in the. ix. book of his fourth decade against the feestes that the Romans
kept in the honor of the ydolyssh god Bacchus / begins his oracion at
prayenge on this wise.

THe solemn making of prayers unto the gods was never so apt nor yet so
necessary in any oracion as it is in this / which shall show and admonysshe
you that they be very and right gods / whom our elders have ordained to be
worcester shypped / adoured / and prayed unto.

Briefly in all prefaces belonging to ^racions deliberatiues the office of the
per sone: and the necessytye or commodytye of the matter that we treat of are
considered.

The narracion.
IN oracio^s deliberatiues we use very seldom narracions / but for the more
part instead of them we make a brief pro posicion co^teinyng the su^me of our
e^tent. As now adays nothing is so necessary as to labor to bring these
dissencions that be in the church to a perfect unity and concord / that
according to Christ's saynges / there be but one shepeherde and one told.
Nevertheless we use sometime brief narra c^ons / wha^ yt some thing has been don
all ready of yt that we give our cou^^ell upon / as in the abouesayd oracion yt
Tult made for Po^pey / where he makes this narracion.

GReat and very perilous war is made both against your tributours / and
also the^ that both co^federate with you: and by you called your fellows /
which war is moved by two right mighty kings / Withridates and Tigranes.
etc. After this manner is a narracion in the oracio^ yt Haniball made to Scipio
/ and is contained in the x. book of ye. 111. decade of Liuius / right proper
and elegant / without any preface beginning his narracion thus. If it has been
ordained by my fortune and desteny that I which first of all ye Carthaginors
began war with the Romans / and which have almoost had the victory so often
in mine hands / should now com of mine own mind to ask peace. I am glad that
fortune has prepared that I should ask it of you specially. And among all
your noble lands this shall not be one of the leest that Haniball gave over to
you / to whom the gods had given before the vyctorye over so many capitains of
the Romans / and that it was your luck to make an end of this war / in the
which the Romans have had far mo evil chances tha^ we of Carthagene. And
whether it were my desteny or chance yt ought me this skornfull shame. I which
began the war wha^ your father was Consul / and after joined bataile with
him when he was made Ca pitayne of the Romans army / must now come unarmed to
his son to ask peace of him. It had been best for both parties if it had
pleased the gods to have sent our fore faders that mind / that you of Rome
would have been content with the Empire of Italy / and we Carthaginoys with
Affrike. For neither S^cil nor Sardinia can be any suffice^t amends to either
of us for so many naue^s / so many armies / so many and so excellent capitaines
lost in our wars between us / but things passed / may sooner be blamed than
meuded. ^e of Carthagene (as touching our part) have so couetyd other
dominions / that at length we had business enough to defend our pos sessions.
Nor the war has not ben only with you in Italy or with us only in Affryke:
but at the pleasure of fortune / sometime here and some there / in so much that
you my masters of Rome have seen ye sta^ derdes and arms of your enemies
hard at your walls and gates of the city. And we on the other side have
herd the noise out of your camp into our city.

After the narracion ought to follow immediately the proposicion of our
council or advise. As after the narracio^ of Haniball before reherced /
follows the proposicion of his purpose thus.

THat thing is now entreated while fortune is favorable unto you / that we
ought most to abhor / and you surely ought above all things to desire /
that is to have peace. And it is most for the pro fyte of us two / which have
the matter in handelyng that peace be had. And sure we be / that what so ever we
agree upon / our cities will ratify the same.

Next follows the confirmacion of tho things yt we entende to persuade /
which must be set out of the places of honesty / pro fite / casines / or
difficulty. As if we will per suade any thing to be done / we shall show that
it is not only honest and laudable: but al so profitable and easy enough to
perform. Or if we can not chose but grant that it is hard / yet we shall
show that it is so honest a deed / so worthy praise / and besides so great
commodity will come thereof / that the hardness ought in no wise to fere us: but
rather be as an iustigacion to take the thing on hand / remembrynge the greek
proverb. Scisno^a ta nasa / that is to say / all excellent and co^me^dable
thing; be hard and of difficulty.

In honesty are co^prehe^ded all virtues / as wysdo^ / justice / due love to
god / and to our parents / liberality / pity / consta^ce / temperance. And
therefore he that will for the co^ fyrmyng of his purpose declare and prove yt
it is honest and commendable yt he ente^deth to persuade him: behooves to have
perfyte knowledge of ye natures of virtues. And al so to have in ready
remembrance sentences both of scripture and of philosophy / as orators and
poets / and beside these / examples of historyes / for garnyssshyng of his
matters.

As concerning the place of utility / we must in all causes look if we may
have any arguments whereby we may prove that our counsel is of such necessity
/ that it can not be chosen but they must needs follow it / for tho arguments
be of far greater strength than they yt do but only prove the vtility of ye
matter. But if we ca^ have no such necessary reasons / tha^ we must search out
arguments to prove our mind to be profitable by circumstances of the cause.
In like manner to persuade a thing by the easines thereof / or dissuade it by the
difficulty of the thing / we must have respect to possibility or i^possibilite
/ for these proves are of strenger nature tha^ the other / and he yt will show
yt a thing may be done easily: must presuppose ye possibilite thereof. As he on
the other side that will persuade a thing not to be done / if he show and
manifest yt it is impossible / argues more stro^gely tha^ if he could but only
prove difficulty in it / for as I said / many thing; of difficulty yet may be
the rather to be taken on hand / that they may get the^ that acheue them the
greater fame and praise. And these arguments be fet out of the cir cu^stances
of ye cause / yt is to say / the time / the place / the doers / the thing it
self / the means whereby it should be done / the cau ses wherefore it should
be done or not / the helps or impedime^tes that may be therein. In this purpose
examples of histories are of great efficacy.

The confutacion is the soilynge and re^llyng of other me^nes sayenges that
have or might be brought against our purpose / wherefore it consists in
places contrary to the places of confirmacio^ / as in prouyng the sayenges of
the contrary part / neither to be honest nor profitable / nor easy to perform
/ or else utterly impossible.

The conclusion stands in two things / that is is to say / a brief and
compendiouse repetyng of all our reasons that we have bronght for us before /
and in mouyng of affections. And so does Ulysses conclude his oracion in the.
xiii. book of Ouides metamorphosy.

Of the third kind of oracions / called Judicial.
ORacions judicial be that long to controversies in the law and plees /
which kind of oracion in old time longed only to Judges and men of law / but
now for the more part it is neglecte of them / though there be nothing more
necessary to quicken them in crafty and wise handelynge of their matters.

In these oracions the first is to find out the state of the cause / which
is a short proposicion / containing the hole effect of all the controversies.
As in the oracion of Tulli / made for Milo / of ye which I made mention in the
beginning of my book. The state of the cause is this. Milo slew Clodius
lawfully / which thing his adversaries denied / and if Tully can prove it^
the plee is won.

Here must be borne away that there be three manner of states in such oracions.

The first is called coniecturall. The second / legitime. The third /
iudiciale / and every of these has his own proper places to fet out
arguments of them / wherefore they shall be spoken of severally. And first we
will treat of state coiecturall / which is used when we be certain that the
deed is done / but we be ignorant who did it / and yet by certain conjectures
we have one suspecte / that of very lykelyhode it should be he that has
committed the crime. And therefore this state is called con iecturall / because
we have no manifest proof / but all only great lykelyhodes / or as the
Rhetoriciens call them / conjectures.

Example.
THere was a great contencion in the Greeks army before Troy between Ulisses
and Ajax / after the death of Achilles / which of them should have his armor
as next to the said Achilles in valiauntnes. In which controuersye when the
Greeks had Iuged the said armor unto Ulisses / Ajax for very great disdain
fell out of his mind / and shortly after in a wode nygh to the hooste / after
he had known (when he came again to him self) what folyssh prankes he had
played in the time of his phrenesy / for sorrow and shame he slew him self.
Sone upon this deed came Ulisses by / which seeing Ajax thrust thrughe with a
sword: came to him / and as he was about to pull out the swerd / the friends of
Ajax chanced to com the same way / which seeing their friend deed / and his
old enemy pullyng out a sword of his body / they accused him of murder.

In very deed here was no proof. For of truth Ulisses was not gylty in the
cause. Never the^es the envy that was between Ajax and him: made the matter to
be not a little suspect / specially for yt he was found there with the said
Ajax alone / wherefore the state of the plee was coniecturall / when there
Ulisses slew Ajax or not.

The preface.
THe preface is here even as it is in other oracions. For we begin accor dyng
to the nature of the cause yt we have on hand / either in blamyng our
aduersary^ or else mouynge the herers to have pity on our client. Or else we
begin at our own per^one / or at the praise of the Judge. etc^.

The narracion.
THe narracio^ or tale is the showing of the deed in manner of an historye /
wherein ye accuser must craftly enterme^gle many suspicions which shall seem to
make his matter prouable. As Tulli in his oracion for Milo / where in his
narracion he intends by certain co^iectures to show yt Clo dius lay in wait
for Milo / he in his said narracion handeleth that place thus.

In the mean season wha^ Clodius had knowledge that Milo had a lawful and
neces ry journey to the city of Lauine ye. xiii. day before the kalendes of
March / to point who should be head priest there / which thing longed to Milo
because he was dictatour of that town: Clodius sodaynely the day before
departed out of Rome to set upon Milo in a lordeshyp of his own / as after
was well perceived. And such haste he made to be going that were as the people
were gadered ye same day for ma^s wherein also he had great adoo him self / and
very necessary it had been for him to have been there / yet this not
withstandyng / all other things aparte: he went his way / which you may be
sure he would never have done / save only that he had fully determined to
prevent a time and place convenient for his malicius ente^r before Miloes coming.

In this piece of Tullies narracion are entermengled first that Clodius knew of
Miloes going / which makes the matter suspecte yt Clodius went before to mete
with him / for this was well known before that Clodius bare Milo great grudge
and malice. Next is showed the place where as Clodius met Milo / which also
gives a great suspicion / for it was nygh Clodius place / where he might sone
take socour / and the the other was in leest assurau^ce. Thyrdly that he departed
out of the city / what time it had been most expedient / ye / and also greatly
requisite for him to have been at home. And that again makes the matter suspect
/ for surely he would not (as Tully him self says) in no wise have been absent
at such a busy time / onles it had been for some great purpose / and what other
should it seem tha^ to ^ce Milo. As surely evident it was that they buckled to
gyther / and this was well known that Milo had a necessary cause to go forth
of Rome at that time. Contra ryly in Clodius could be perceived non other
occasion to depart than out of the city: but of lykelyhood to lie in wait
for Milo.

The proposicion.
OUt of the narracion must be gaderyd a brief sentence / wherein shall stand
the hole pithe of the cause / for Rhetoriciens put incontinent af ter the
narracion division / which is a part of contencion / and does bryefly show
wherein the controversy does stand / or what things shall be spoken of in the
oracion. This division is divided into seiunction and distribucion.

Setunction is when we show wherein our adversaries and we agree / and what it
is / whereupon we strive. As they that pledyd Clodius cause against Milo /
might on this manner have used setunction. That Milo slew Clodius: our
adversaries can not denaye / but whether he might so do lawfully or not / is
our controversy. Distribucion is the proposicion wherein we declare of what
things we will speak / of which if we propose how many they be / it is called
enumeracion / but if we do not express the nombre / it is called exposicion.

Example of both is had in the oracion that Tully made to the people that
Pompeyus might be made chief captain of the wars against Mithridates and
Tigranes / where after the preface and narra cion he makes his proposicion by
exposicion thus.

First I think it expedyent to speak of the nature and kind of this war /
and after that of the greatness thereof / and than to show how a^ head or
chief capytayne of any army should be chosen. which last membre of his
exposicion he again distributeth into four parts thus as follows.

Truly this is mine opinion / that he which shall be a governor of an host
/ ought to have these four propertyes in him. The first is / that he have
perfyte knowledge of all such things as longs to war. The second is that
he be a man of his hands. The third that he be a man of such auctority: that
his dignity may cause his soldiers to have him in reverence and awe. The
fourth is that he be fortunate and lucky in all things that he goes about.

Tully in the oracion for Milo / proposes all only showing wherein the contro
uersy of the plee did stand on this manner as follows.

IS there than any thing else yt must t tried and judged in this cause save
this: whether of them both began the ^raye and intended to murder the
tother^ No surely. So that if it can be founde^ that Milo went about to
distroye Clodius / than he be punysshed therefore accordyngly. But if it can be
proved that Clodius was the begynner and laid wait for to slay Milo / and so
was the sercher of his own death / and that what Milo did it was but to
defend him self from the treason of his enemy and the sauegarde of his life:
that than he may be delivered and quyt.

Of confirmacion.
THe confirmacion of the accuser is fetched out of these places / will / and
power. For these two things will cause the person that is accused to be
greatly suspect that he had will to do the thing that he is accused of / and
that he might well enough bring it to pass.

To prove that be had will thereto: you must go to. (...). places. The one is ye
qualite of the person / and the other is the cause that me^yd him to the deed.
The quality of the person is thus handled. First to look what is his name or
surname / and if it be nough ty to say that he had it not for nothing: but
that nature had such pryue power in men to make them give names according to
the manners of every person. Than next to behold his country. So Tulli in his
ora cion made for Lucius Flaceus / to unproue the witness that was brought
against him by Brekes / lays unto them the lightness of their country. This
(says Tulli) do I say of the hole nation of Brekes. I grant to them that
they have good lernyng / and the knowledge ot many sciences. Nor I deny not but
that they have a pleasant and marueylouse sweet speech. They are also people of
high and excellent quick wit / and thereto they be very facundiouse. These and
such other qualities wherein they booste the^ self greatly: I will not repyn^
against it that they here the maistry therein. But as concerning equity and
good conscience / requisite / in berynge of record / or gyuyng of any wytnes /
and also as touching faithfulness of word and promise: truly this nation
never observed* this property / neither they knew not what is the strength /
auctoritye / and weight thereof.

So to Englysshmen is attributed su^ptuousnes in meats and drinks. To French
men / pride / and delight in new fantasyes. To Flemmynges and Almaynes / great
drynkyng / and yet inue^tife wits. To Britayns / Gascoignes / and Polones /
larrecine. To Spanierdes / agilitye. To ytaliens / high wit and much subtilty.
To Scotts / bold nes / to Irissh men / hastines. To Boemes valiauntnes and
tenacite of opinions. etc.

After that to look on his kynred / as if his father or mother or other kynne
were of ill disposicion / for as the tree is: such fruit it bears.

On this wise does Phillis cntwyte Demophon / that his father Theseus
vncurteysly and traitorously left his love Ariadna alone in the desert isle of
Naxus / and contrary to his promise stale from her by night / adding Heredem
patria perfide frandis agis. That is to say / untrue and false forsworn man /
thou playest kyndely the fathers heir / in deceytable begylynge of thy true
lover.

After that we must look upon the se^ / whether it be man or woman that we
accuse / to se if any argument ca^ be deduct out of it to our purpose. As in
men is noted au dacity / women be commonly tymerouse.

Than next / the age of the person. As in Therence Simo speaks of his son
Pamphilus / says unto his man called Sosia / how could thou know his
conditions or nature before / while his age and fear / and his master did let
it to be known.

Hipermestra in Ouides epistels ioineth these. (...). places of sex and age to
gyther thus.

I am a woman and a young maiden / mild and gentle / both by nature and years.
My soft hands are not apt to fires batayles.

After these follow strength of body / or agi lity / and quicknes of wit / out
of which may be brought many reasons to affirm our pur pose. So Tulli in his
oracion for Milo / willing to prove yt Clodius was the begynner of the fraye /
shows that Milo (which was never wont but to have men about him) by chance
at that time had in his company certain Musiciens and maidens that waited on
his wife / whom he had sitting with him in his wagen. Contraryly Clodius that
was never wo^t before but to tide in a wagen and to have his wife with him: at
that time rode forth on horseback. And where as before be was always
accustomed to have knaves and queen's in his company: he had than non but tall
men with him / and (as who should say) men piked out for the nones. To this is
added form / as to assay if we can have any argument to our purpose out of the
per sons face or countenance / and so does Tully argue in his oracio^ against
Piso / saying.

See thou not now thou be? do you not now perceive what is men's
co^playnt on thy visage? there is no^ that co^plaineth that I wot not what
Surrien and of their flock which be but newly crepte up to ho nour out of the
donghyll is now made con sull of the city. For this servile color has not
deceived us nor hery cheke balls / nor rotten and fylthy tethe / thine iyes /
thy brows / forhed / and hole cou^tenau^ce / which in a manner does manifest
me^nes co^dieto^s and na ture it has deceived us. This done / we must consider
how he has be^ brought up yt we accuse / among whom he has lived / and
whereby / how he governs his household / and assay if we ca^ pyke out of these
ought for our purpose. Also of what state he is of / fre or bond / rich or
pore / beryng office or not / a man of good name / or otherwise / wherein he
deliteth most / which places do express man's living / and by his living:
his will and mind / as I would declare more fully / save that in introductions
men must labor to be short / and again they are such that he that has any
perceyuyng may sone know what shall make for his purpose / and how to set it
furthe. And therefore this shall suffyse as touching the quality of the person.

If we bear away this for a general rule (that what makes for the accuser
evermore the contrary) is sure stay for the defender / if he can prove it / or
make it of the more lykelyhood. As Tully in defending Milo / lays to Clodius
friends charges that he had non about him but chose^ me^. And for to clear Milo
he she weth the contrary / that he had with him syngyng laddes and women
servants that waited on his wife / which makes it of more likelihood yt
Clodius went about to slay Milo: than Milo him.

The cause that moves to the mischief lies in two things. In natural
impulsion / and racionacion.

Natural impulsion is anger / hatred / co ^etyse / loue^ or such other
affections.

So Simo in Therence / when he had said that Dauus (who^ he had poynted to wayt
upon his sone Pamphilus) would do all that might lie in him both with hand
and foot / rather to dysplease him: than to please Pamphilus mind. And Sofia
demanded why he would do so. Simo made answer by raciocinacion / saying /
do thou ask that? mary his ungracious and unhappy mind is the cause thereof.

Oenon in Ouides epistles joins to gyther quality and natural impulsion /
saying. A (...) et ^upido credatur reddita ^irgo? which is in English.
Think you that she that was carried away of a young man / and hot in love /
was restored again a maid?

Tulli in the oracion for Milo / among other arguments brings in one
against Clodius by natural impulsion of hatred / she wynge that Clodius had
cause to hate Milo first / for he was one of them that la boured for the same
Tullyes reuocacyon from exyle / which Tulli Clodius maliciously hated. Again
that Milo oppressyd many of his furio^se purposes. And finally because the said
Milo accused him and cast him before the Senate and people of Rome.

Raciocinacio^ is that comes of hope of any commodity / or to (...) any
discommodity. As Tully argues in his oracion for Milo against Clodius by
raciocinacion to prove that it was he that laid wayt for Milo on this manner.

IT is sufficient to prove that this cruel and wicked be had a great cause
to slay Milo / if he would bring his matters that he went about to pass / and
great hope if he were ones gone / not to be let in his pretenced malyee.

After raciocinacion follows comprobacion / to show that no man else had any
cause to go there about / save he whom we accuse / nor no profit could com to
no man thereof: save to him.

These are the ways whereby an orator shall prove that the person accused
had will to the thing that is laid to his charge.
TO prove that he might do it: ye must go to the circumstance of the cause / as
that he had leyser enough thereto / and place conuement and strength withal.
Also you shall prove it by signs / which are of meruaylouse efficacye in this
behalf / wherefore here must be noted that signs be either words or deeds
that either did go before or else follow the deed. As Tully in his oracion now
often alleged argues against Clodius by signs going before the deed / as that
Clodius said three days before Milo was slain: that he should not live three
days to an end. And that he went out of the city a little before Milo rode
forth with a great company of strong and myscheuous knaves.

Signs following are as if after the deed was done he fled / or else when it
was laid to his charge: he blusshed or waxed pale / or stutted and could not
well speak.

The contrary places (as I said before) long to the defender / save that in
signs he must use. ii. things / absolucion and inuercio^.

Absolucio^ is whereby the defendour shows that it is laufull for him to do
that what the adversary brings in for a sign of his malice.

Erample.
A man is found covering of a deed bo die / and thereupon accused of murder /
he may answer that it is laufull to do so for ye pre seruacion of his body
from rauons and other that would devour him / till time he had warued people
to fetch and bury him.

Inuereion is whereby we show that the sign which is brought against us: makes
for us. As I would not have tarried to cover him if I had done the deed my
self: but have fled and shronke a side into some other way for fear of
taking.

Of the conclusion.
THe conclusion is as I have said before in brief repetynge of the effect of
our reasons / and in mouynge the Judges to our purpose. The ac cuser to
punysshe the person accused. The defender / to move him to pity.

Of the state iuridiciall / and the handelynge thereof.
AS state coniectural comes out of this questyon (who did the deed) so when
there is no doubt but that the deed is done / and who did it / many times
controversy is had / whether it has been done laufully or not. And this state
is negociall or iuridiciall / which con teyneth the right or wrong of the
deed. As in the oracyon of Tully for Milo / the state is iuridiciall / for open
it was that Clo dius was slain / and that Milo slew him / but whether he killed
him laufully or not: is the controversy and state of the cause, as I have before
declared.

The preamble and narracion as before.
THe confirmacion has certain places appropred thereto / but here must be
marked that state negociall is double / absolute / and assu^ptyue.

State negociall absolute is when the thing that is in controversy is
absolutely defended to be laufully done. As in the oracio^ of Tulli for Milo /
the deed is styfly affirmed to be lawfully done in s^eyng Clo dius / seeing
that Milo did it in his own defense / for the law permits to repel
violence violently.

The places of confirmacion in state ab solute are these / nature / law /
custom / equi ty or reason / judgment / necessity / bargayne or covenant. Of
the which places Tul ly in his oracion for Milo brings in the more part to
gyther in a clust^r on this manner.

IF reason has prescrybed this to learned and wise men / and necessity has
driven it into barbarous and rude folk / and custom keeps it among all
nations / and nature has planted it in brute beestes / that every creature
should defend him self and save his life and his body from all violence by any
manner of socour / what means or way so ever it were. you ca^ not judge this
deed evil done / except you will judge that when men mete with theuys or
murderers / they must either be slain by the wepons of such unthrifty and
malicious persons: either else perysshe by your sentence given in judgment upon
them.

State assumptiue is when the defense is feeble of it self / but yet it may be
holpeu by some other thing added to it. And the places longing to this state
are granting of the fault / remouynge of the faut / or (as we say in our
tongue) layeng it from us to an other / and tanslatynge of the fau^e.

Brauntyng of the faut is when the per son accused denteth not the deed / but
yet he desires to be forgyuen / and it has. ii. places (...) anneryd to it /
purgacion and deprecacio^.

Puxgacion is wha^ he says he did it not maliciously: but by ignorance or
mishap which place Cato uses ironiously in Sa lust / thus. My mind is that
ye have pyty with you / for they that have don amysse be but very young men /
and desire of honor drove them to it.

Deprecacio^ is wha^ we have non excuse: but we call upon the Justices mercy.
The handelynge whereof Tulli writes in his book of inuencion thus.

HE that laboreth to be forgyue^ of his faut / must reherce (if he can) some
benefytes of his / done before time / and show that they be far greater in
their nature than is the crime that he has commyt^ed / so that (how be it he
has done greatly amysse) yet the goodness of his fore merits are far bygger
/ and so may well oppress this one faut. Next after that it behooves him to
have refuge to the merytes of his elders / if there be any / and to open them.
That don / he must return to the place of purgacion / and show that he did
not the deed for any hate or malice / but either by folysshnes / or else by the
entisement of some other / or for some prouable cause.

And than promise faithfully that this faut shall teache him to beware from
thens forth / and also that their benefytes that forgive him shall bind him
assuredly never to do so more / but perpetually to abhor any such offense /
and with that to show some great hope ones to make them a great recompense and
pleasure therefore again. After this let him (if he can) declare some kynred
between the^ and him / or frendshyp of his elders / and amplifye the greatenes
of his service and good heart toward them / if it shall please them to forgive
this faut / and add the nobility of them that would feign have him delivered.
And than he shall soberly declare his own vectucs and such things as ve in
him perteynyng to honesty and praise / that he may by these means seem rather
worthy to be auauticed in honor for his good qualities / than to be punished
for his fall.

This done / let him reherce some other that have be forgyuen greater fautes
than this is. It shall also greatly avail if he can show that he has in
time before ben in authority and bare a rule over other / in the which he was
never but gentle and glad to forgive them that had offended vu derneth him.
And than let him crtenuate his own fault / and show that there followed not so
great damage thereof / and that but little profit or honesty will follow of his
punysshment. And finally than by common places to move the judge to mercy and
pitic upon him.

The adversary must (as I have showed before) use for his purpose contrary
places.

Some Rhetoriciens put no mo places of deprecacion than only this that is here
last reherced of Tulli / that is to do our best to move the justice to mercy
and pity.

Remocion of the fault is when we put it from us and lay it to another.

Example.
THe Uenecians have commanded certayue to go in ambassade to England / and
thereuppon appointed them what they shall have to bear their charges / which
money assigned: they can not get of the treasouter: At the day appointed they
go not / whereupon they are accused to the Senate. Here they must ley the fau^
from them to the treasoucer / which dispatched them not according / as it was
ordey ned that he should.

Tra^slacion of the faut is / when he that confesses his faut says that he
did it: mo ued by the indignacion of the maliciouse deed of an other.

Example.
Hynge Agamennon / which was chief capit ayne of the Greeks at the siege of
Troy / when he came home was slayue of Egistus by the treason of Clitenestra
his own wife / which murder his son Orestes seeing / when he came to man's
state / revenged his fathers death on his mother / ^ slew her / whereupon he
was accused. Here Orestes can not deny but he slew his mother: But he lays
for him that his mothers abominable injury constrained him thereto / by cause
she slew his father.

And this is the handelynge of confirmacion in state assumptiue.

The conclusions in these oracions are like to the conclusions of other.

Of state legitime / and the handelyng thereof.
STate legitime is when the controversy stands in definicion or contrary
laws / or doutfull wrytynges / or raciocinacion / or translacion.

Of definicion.
DEfinicion (as Tully writes) is when in any writing is some word put / ye
significacio^ whereof requires exposicion.

Example.
A Law may be made that such as forsake a ship in time of tempest should
lose their right yt they have / either in the ship or in any goods within
the same vessel / and that they shall have the shy^ ^ the goods that abide
still in her.

It chanced. 11. men to be in a little crayer / of the which vessel the one
man was both owner and governor / and the other: possessour of the goods. And
as they were in the main see / they espied one that was swymmynge in the sea /
and as well as he could holdyng up his hands to them for socour / whereupon
they (being moved with pity) made toward him / and took him up. within a
little after arose a great tempest upon them / and put them in such ieopardy
that the owner of the ship (which was also governor) lepte out of the ship
into the ship bote / and with the rope that tied the boat to the ship: he
governed the ship as well as he could. The merchant that was within the ship /
for great despair of the loss of his goods / wyllyng to slay him self:
threst him self in ^ his own sword / but as it chanced the wound was
neither mortal nor very greuouse / but natwithsta^dyng for that time he was
unable to do any good in helpyng the ship against the impetuousnes of ye
storm. The third man (which not long before had suffered ship wrack) gate
him to the stern / and help the vessel the best that lay in him. At length
the storm seaced / and the ship came safe into the haven / bote and all. He yt
was hurt (by help of chirurgiens) recoue red anon. Now every of these three
challenge the ship and goods as his own. Here every man lays for him the
law above reherced / and all their controversy lies in the expoundynge of
three words / abiding in the ship / and forsakynge the ship / and what we shall
in such case call the ship / whether the boat as part of the ship: or else the
ship it self alone.

The handelynge hereof is. First in few words and plain to declare the
significa cion of the word to our purpose / and after such manner as may seem
reasonable to the audience. Ner^e / after such exposicion to declare and prove
the said exposicion true / with as many arguments as we can.

Thyrdely to join our deed with the exposicion / and to show that we only did
observe the very intent of the law. Than to refell the exposicion of our
adversaries / and to show that their exposicion is contrary to reason and
equity / and that no wise man will so take the law as they expound it / and
that the exposicion is neither honest nor profitable / and to couster their
exposicion with ours / and to show that ours conteyneth the verity / and
theyrs is falce. Ours honest / reasonable / and profitable: Theyrs clean
contrary. And than search out like examples / either of greater matters or of
less / or else of egall matters / and to manifest by the that our mind is the
very truth.

Contrary laws are where the tone seems evidently to contrary the other. As
if a law were that he who^ his father has forsaken for his son / shall in no
wise have any portion of his fathers goods. And an other law / that who so
ever in time of tem pest abides in the ship: shall have ye ship and goods.
Than pose that one which was of his father so abiecte and deuyed for his
child: was in a ship of his fathers in time of sore wether / and when all
other for feareof lesynge them self forsook the ship and gate them into the boat: he only abodc / and by chance was safe brought into the haven /
whereupon he chalengeth the vessel for his / where as the party defendant will
lay against him that he is abdicate or forsaken of his father / and so can not
by the law have any part of his goods.

Here must he say again for him that this law alleged does all only private
from their fathers goods such as be abdicate and yet would challenge a part as
his children / but yt he does not so / but requires to have the ship / not as
a son to his father: but as any other stranger might / seeing the law gives
him the ship yt abides in her in time of necessity. And so the handelynge of
this state / either to deny one of yt laws and show that it has been before
anulled / or else to expound it after the sense that is mete to our purpose.

Doubtful writynge is where either the mind of the author seems to be
contrary to that that is written / which some call wry tynge and sentence / or
else it is when the worcester des may be expounded diverse ways.

Example of the first.
MEn say it is a law in Caleys that no stranger may go upon the town walls
on pain of death. Now than pose that in time of war the town being hard
besieged / an alien dwelling in the town gets him to the walls among the
soudiers / and does more good than any one man again. Now after the siege
ended he is accused for transgressyng of the law^ which in words is evidently
against him. But here the defendaunt must declare the writers mind by
circumstaunces / what stranger he did forbid / and what time* and after what
manner / and in what intent he would not have any stranger to come on the
walls / and in what intent his mind might be understood to suffer an alien
to go upon the walls. And here must the effect of the strangers will be
declared / that he went up to defend ye town to put back their enemies. And
thereto he must say that the maker was not so indiscreet and vnreaso nable that
he would have no manner of excepcion which should be to the wealth / profit / or
preseruacion of the town. For he that will not have ye law to be vnderstande^
ac cordyng to equity / good manner / and nature / entendeth to prove the maker
thereof either an unjust man / or folyssh or enuiouse.

The accuser contraryly shall praise the maker of the law for his great wisdom
/ for his plain writing without any manner of ambiguity / yt no stranger
should p^sume to go upon the walls / and reherce ye law word for word / and
tha^ show some reasonable cause that mouyd the maker of the law that he would
utterly that no stranger should ascend the walls. etc. Era^ple of the second.

A Man in his testament gives to two young daughters that he has two hundred
sheep / to be delivered at the day of their marriage / on this manner. I will
that mine executoures shall give to my daughters at the time of their marriage
every of them an hundred sheep / such as they will. At the time of marriage
they de maunde their cattle / which the executours deliver not of such sort
as the mayde^s would *whereupon the co^trouersy arises. For the executours say
they are bound to deliver to every of them an hundred sheep / such as they
that be the executours will. Now vere stands the dout / to whom we shall
refer this word they / to the daughters / or to the executours.

The maidens say nay thereto / but that it was their fathers mind that they
should have every of them an. C. sheep / such as they that be the daughters
will.

The handelyng of doutfull writing is to show if it be possible that it is not
wryte^ doutfully by cause it is the common manner to take it after as we say /
and that it may sone be known by such words as partly go before that clause
and pertly follow / and that there be few words / but if they be considered so
alone / they may anon be taken doubtfully. And first we shall show if we can yt
it is not doubtfully written / for there is no reasona ble man: but be will take
it as we say. Tha^ shall we declare by that that goes before / and follows /
that it is clerly eum as we say / and that if we consider the words of the^
self they will seem to be of ambiguity / but seeing they may by the rest of
the writing be evident enough / they ought not to be ta ken as doubtful. And
than show that if it had beu his mind that made the writing to have it taken
as the aduersarye says: he neded net to have wryte^ any such worcester des. As in
the example now put / the maidens may say that if it had been their fathers
mind that the executours should have delivered such sheep as it had pleased
them to deliver: he neded not to have added these words such as they will.
For yt they had not ben put / it would not have been dought but that the
executours delyuerynge every of them an hundred sheep (what so ever they were)
had fulfilled the will / and could have been no further compelled / wherefore if
his mind was as they say / it was a great folly to put in tho words which
made a plain matter to be vnplaine. And than finally show it is more ho nest
and convenient to expound it as we say: than as our adversaries do.

Raciocinacion is when the matter is in controversy / whereupon no law is deereed
/ but yet the judgment thereof may be found out by laws made upon matters
somdele resembling thereunto.

As in Rome was this law made / that if any person were distraught / his
possessions and goods should come to the hands of his next kynne.

And an other law / what any householder does ordeyn and make as coueernyng his
householde and other goods / it is approbate and confirmed by the law.

And an other law / if any householder dye intestate / his money and other
goods shall re main to his next kyn. It chanced one to kill his own mother /
whereupon he was taken and co^de^pned to death / but while he lay in prison /
certain of his familiare friends came thither to him / and brought with them a
clerk to write his testament / which he there made / and made such
executours as it pleased him. After his death his kynnesme^ challenge his goods
/ his executours say the^ nay / whereupon arises co^trouersy before the justice.
There is no law made upon this case / whether he yt has killed his mother may
make any testament or not / but it may be reasoned on both perties by the
laws above reherced. The kynsmen shall allege ye law made for the^ yt be out of
their minds / p^supposyng him not to be in much other case / or else he would
not have don the deed. The contrary part shall allege the other law / and show
that it was none alienacion of mind: but some other cause yt moved him to it /
and that he has had his punysshment therefore / which he should not have
suffered of convenient if he had been beside him self* Translation is which the
lawyers call excepcion / as if the person accused plead that it is not lawful
for the the other to accuse him / or that the Judge can be no judge in that cause.
etc.

The conclusion of the Author.
THese are my special and singular good Lord which I have purposed to write
as touching the chief point of ye. iiii. that I said in the beginning to long
to a Rhetoricien / and which is more difficulty tha^ the other. iii. so that it
ones had / there is no very great maistry to com by the resydue.
Natwithstandynge if I se that it be first acceptable to your good lordship /
in whom next god and his holy saints I have put my chief confidence and trust
/ and after yt if I find that it seem to ye reders a thing worthy to be looked
on / and yt your lordshyp and they think not my labor taken in vain: I will
assay my self in ye other parts / and so make and acco^plyssh ye hole werk.
But now I have fo lowed ye facion of Tulli / who made a seue rall work of
muencion. And though many things be left out of this treatise that ought to be
spoken of / yet I suppose that this shall be sufficyent for an introduction to
young begynners / for whom all only this book is made. For other that been
entered all ready shall have little need of my labor / but they may seek more
meter things for their purpose / either in Hermogines among the Greeks / or
else Tullie or Trapesonce / among the Latins. And to them that be young
begynners nothing can be to plain or to short / wherefore Horace i his book of
ye craft of Poetry says.

Quicquid precipies esto breuis vt cito di^
Percipiant animi dociles teneant q fideles.
what so ever ye will teach (says he) be brief therein / that the minds of
the herers or reders may the caslyer perceive it / and the better bear it away.
And the Emperor Justinian says in the first book of his institucions in the
paragraph of justice and right / that over great curiosity in the first
principles / make him that is studiouse of the faculty either to forsake it:
or else to attain it with very great and tedy ouse labor / and many times with
great despair to com to the end of his purpose. And for this cause I have been
far less cu riouse than I would else have been / and also a great deal the
shorter. If this my labor may please your lordeshyp / it is the thing that I
do in it most desire / but if it seem both to you and other a thing that is
very rude and skant worth the lokynge on: yet Aristotle's words shall confort
me / who says yt men be not only bound to good authors: but also to bad /
because yt by their writing they have provoked cunnynger men to take the matter
on hand / which would else peradventure have held their peace. Truly there
is nothyuge that I would be more gladder of / than if it might chance me on
this manner to cause them that be of much better learning and excer cise in
this art than I / of who^ I am very sure that this realm has great plenty /
that they would set the pen to the paper / and by their industry obscure my
rude igno raunce. In the mean space I beseech the reders / if they find any
thing therein that may do them any profit / that they give the thanks to god
and to your lordshyp / and that they will of their charity pray unto the
blessed Trinite for me / that when it shall please the godhed to take me from
this transitory life / I may by his merey be of the nombre of his elect to
perpetual salvation.
