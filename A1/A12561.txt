A little treatise against sedicyous persons.
To trolle away or trolle in / let not trolle spare
If trolle truly trolle / trolle needs not to care.

OF late I perused / two purposes several
In their kinds clerkely handeled / the truth for to tell
Trolle away and Trolle in / men do them call
Treatyng upon matter / concerning the late Crumwell
The one utterly myndyng / the other to repel
Trolle away (the troth is) much touched the quycke
And Trolle in (somewhat galled) began for to kycke.
yet Trolle away told troth / it can not be denied
Declaryng the offense / wherein Crumwell offended
Trolle in being troubled / when he it espied
With trollynges to cover it / full subtelly contended
Some trollers there be / I would were amended
For who that craftily covers / any others offense
Of lykelyhode / in his own heart / has the same pretense.
Truly to trolle / it is no manner of shame
And trollyng untrue / is not to be mayntayned
As every thing is / so to give it propre name
Among all true honest men / should not be disdayned
The scripture so techeth us / it can not be feigned
Against scripture who stryueth / he is none other like
Than a traytoure to his prince / and to god an heretyke, Ve qui dicitis bonu^
malum et malum bonum. Esa. quinto.

I entende not to trolle / to take any part
Diuisyon to encreace / it needs nothing
But sorowfully syghyng / I trolle in my heart
With my self in mind / many times reuoluyng
How god to us / has ordained the most noble king
Who uniformly to knyt us / has traueyled full sore
Yet many trifelyng trollers / care little therefore.
But as trollers troubelous and full of envy
At the laws of god / and of our good king
In their trollynges do trust / yet that their old heresy
All good ordrys set a part / shall florisshe and spring
Their prechers / no less conforte / in their sermons do bring
Even lately exhortyng them / auoydyng all dread
And persecution not regardyng / thoroughly to proceed.
With many words more troublous / than now I will reherce
Not doutyng at all / but at length they shall be known
Such trollyng treacherous / my heart does sore perce
Consyderyng how sedicyously / among us they besowen
Of late I well trusted / they had been over blown
But now I well parceyue / that neither favor nor smarte
From the body can expel / that is rooted in the heart.
A true trollyng heart / would be loath to pretend
Any purpose to maintain / against god or his king
The confession of an heretyke / that lately did offend
And among others / suffered for his deseruyng
Secretly they embrace / as a most precious thing
And yet plainly will I prove / by good law and reason
Contained therein / both heresy and treason.
In any wise imprynted / they will not it shall be
The dangers thereof in themselves mystrustynge
Wherefore every man may well perceive and se
What hertes they do bear to god and our good king
Every of them secretly must have it in writing
But Christ says verily there is ndthynge conceled
But at length shall be known / and openly reveled. Nihil est opertum quoq non
reueletur. neque occultum quod no^ sciatur. Math, x,

Who against them trolleth / a Papyst they him name
They have no other thing / themselves for to defend
I would that all Papystes / had an open shame
And that all heretykes / them selves would amend
Than should we have no cause / further to contend
But uniformly to live / the one with the other
And joyfully to enhabyt / as brother with brother. Ecce quam bonu^ et quam
iocu^du^ habitare fratres in unum. psa, c, xxxij

Such should be our trollynges / Christ us so teaches
Commanding ever peace / among us for to be Mathei. x. Luce. ij. Io, xiiij.
xv,

Untruly he trolleth / that otherwise preaches
Styreng to any sedicion / malice or envy
Where banisshed is discord / and raygneth all charity
That realm in god rests / and god is in it /
Being charity him self / as says the holy writ. Deus charitas est and qui
manet i^ caritate i^ deo manet et deus in eo i. Ioha. iij.

Than toward that charity / trolle we on a pace
Auauncyng our selves / with all conuenyent speed
Amore acceptable pilgrimage / surely never was
For which god gave to man / any merit or mede
Our labor or great burden / let us nothing dread
Nor regarding the wylfulnes / of our body or flesh
For at the iorneyes end / Christ will us refresshe. Venite ad me oe^s qui
laboratis and onorati estis, et ego reficia^ uos Mathei. xv

And than as true trollers / together let us remain
Parfectly fast knyt / in one peace / unity and love
With glory unto god / evermore glad and feign
Our noble Prince truly to serve / as does us behoue oi^s ai^a po sub. subdita
sit. to, 13.

And all others to tender / as duty does us move
Vsyng still among us / the self same love and concord
Which is to us commanded / by Christ the eternal lord. Hoc est ma^datu^
meu^ ut diligatis i^uice^ sicut Ioh. xv.

And now in that love / let us all with one voice pray
For the preseruacion of Henry our most noble king
And Katheren our Queen / that they together may
Prosperously continue / to their hertes desyring
And Edward our Prince / that most angelyke thing
That they all together may long live and rest
And after with him to raygne / qui in celis est.
God save the King.
To Trolle away or Trolle in / let not Trolle spare
If Trolle truly Trolle / Trolle needs not to care.

Composed by Thomas Smyth / servant to the kings royal majesty.
And clerk of the Queen's graces counsel / though most unworthy,
