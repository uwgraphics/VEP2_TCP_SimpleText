Dauy Dycars Dream,
WHen faith in friends bear fruit, and folysh fancyes fade,
and crafty catchers cum to naught, and hate great love has made
When fraud flies far from town, and lewterers leave the field,
And rude shall run a rightful race, and all men be well wild:
When gropers after gain, shall carpe for commonwealth,
And wyly workers shall disdain, to fygge and live by stelth:
When wisdom walks a loft, and folly syts full low,
And virtue vanquish pampred vice, and grace begins to grow.
When Justice ioynes to truth, and law looks not to meede,
and bribes help not to build fair bowres, nor gifts great gloto^s feed
When hongre hides his head, and plenty please the poor,
And niggerdes to the nedy men, shall never shut their door:
When double dark deceit, is out of credit worn,
And fauning speech is falshed found, and craft is laughed to skorne
When pride which picks the purs, gapes not for garments gay
No iauels wear no velvet weeds, nor wandri^g wits bear sway
When riches wrongs no right, nor power poor put back,
Nor covetous creepes not into Court, nor learned, livings lack
When slipper sleights are seen, and far fatchers be found,
And private profit and self love, shall both be put in pound:
When debt no sergeant dreeds, and cowriters credit keep,
and might mels not with merchandise, nor lords shall sell no sheep:
When lucre lasts not long, and hurd great heaps does hate,
And every wight is well content, to walk in his estate,
When truth does tread the streets, and liars lurk in den,
And Rex does reign and rule the roast, and weeds out wicked men:
Then baelfull barnes be blythe* that here in England won,
Your strife shall stynt I undertake, your dreedfull days ar done:
Finis.
Quod. T. Churcharde.
